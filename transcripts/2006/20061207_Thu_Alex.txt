[00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:05.901]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.561 --> 00:00:07.622]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.343 --> 00:00:09.464]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.104 --> 00:00:10.945]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.665 --> 00:00:12.586]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:16.890]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.493]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.691 --> 00:00:42.751]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:43.131]  Welcome.
[00:00:43.171 --> 00:00:44.632]  Thank you for joining us today.
[00:00:44.712 --> 00:01:00.697]  Coming up in the second hour, here on December 7th, 2006, the anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attacks by the Imperial Japanese Navy and their air forces, we have Admiral Kimmel's
[00:01:02.512 --> 00:01:09.939]  son coming on the broadcast to discuss the real history of that provocateur event.
[00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:13.402]  That was not government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:23.812]  It was a provocateur and sheltered and prepared event.
[00:01:24.072 --> 00:01:26.034]  There are different types of government ops
[00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:39.366]  And this is one of those three types, so we'll be going over that today, because staged crises, orchestrated crises, are the zeitgeist of the New World Order.
[00:01:39.406 --> 00:01:45.969]  They are the juggler artery to their larger operations.
[00:01:47.057 --> 00:01:50.698]  Let me just run through some of the news I've got in front of me we'll cover in this first hour.
[00:01:51.418 --> 00:01:57.320]  FDA, Food and Drug Administration, rejects new limits on mercury in vaccines.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.922]  Now, I know the news for the last five years has been telling you there's no mercury in them.
[00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:22.783]  But if you read behind the major headlines and Fox Television and CNN, you will learn they've actually increased the mercury five-fold on average with the measles, mumps, and rubella, triple jab, and of course, good old flu vaccinations.
[00:02:24.764 --> 00:02:26.645]  No one really knows why they've increased it.
[00:02:26.665 --> 00:02:27.585]  I mean, they haven't told us.
[00:02:27.685 --> 00:02:28.406]  We know why.
[00:02:28.526 --> 00:02:30.687]  It's like, oh, you're trying to avoid the mercury?
[00:02:30.707 --> 00:02:31.708]  Well, just increase it.
[00:02:33.792 --> 00:02:37.493]  FDA rejects new limits on mercury in vaccines.
[00:02:38.073 --> 00:02:42.294]  Group petitioned government to restrict use of controversial preservative.
[00:02:42.314 --> 00:02:46.755]  This is Associated Press itself posted on MSNBC.
[00:02:48.715 --> 00:02:51.595]  Also, Prince Charles is saying we're living on borrowed time.
[00:02:51.655 --> 00:02:55.836]  Of course, the answer is world taxation and forced population reduction.
[00:02:56.316 --> 00:02:57.897]  This is the London Evening Standard.
[00:02:57.977 --> 00:02:59.777]  We'll be going over that for you.
[00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:04.722]  The Iraq Study Group and others are claiming most U.S.
[00:03:04.762 --> 00:03:12.025]  forces will be out by 2008, but if you read the fine print, that means they'll still have a huge contingent of U.S.
[00:03:12.105 --> 00:03:12.465]  forces.
[00:03:12.505 --> 00:03:17.947]  They'll just be under some type of NATO auspice, so it won't really, I guess, be U.S.
[00:03:18.007 --> 00:03:18.407]  forces.
[00:03:20.127 --> 00:03:26.729]  Also, the Sears Tower caught fire yesterday, but they're in Chicago that Larry Silverstein owns, but it didn't collapse.
[00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.310]  Steel buildings never do, but
[00:03:28.877 --> 00:03:32.500]  Just like when the World Trade Centers had fires multiple times in the past, they didn't collapse.
[00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:36.523]  But it's interesting that they didn't collapse this time.
[00:03:37.985 --> 00:03:40.607]  Also, another story here out of Wired Magazine.
[00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:43.089]  Say hello to the Goodbye Weapon.
[00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:49.294]  They are deploying the microwave guns in Iraq and soon to deploy them here in the United States.
[00:03:50.638 --> 00:03:52.759]  Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting.
[00:03:52.879 --> 00:04:03.505]  Fair is covering Glenn Beck, one of the chief neocon operatives, posing as a non-partisan, and he is calling for Muslims to be put in concentration camps.
[00:04:03.685 --> 00:04:04.685]  He's threatening them with it.
[00:04:05.006 --> 00:04:05.766]  That's the headline.
[00:04:06.126 --> 00:04:07.907]  Flirting with Fascism on CNN.
[00:04:08.267 --> 00:04:09.008]  Headline news.
[00:04:09.028 --> 00:04:15.131]  Host Glenn Beck, a sniveling little bug-eyed creature, threatens Muslims with concentration camps.
[00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:18.673]  You can be assured they'll put a few Muslims in them, but that's not who they're for.
[00:04:19.373 --> 00:04:19.633]  No, no, no.
[00:04:19.653 --> 00:04:21.373]  They're bringing in record levels of Muslims.
[00:04:21.994 --> 00:04:24.674]  It's for gun owners, property owners, it's for patriots.
[00:04:24.714 --> 00:04:30.795]  That's the main target of the New World Order here in the United States and Canada.
[00:04:32.236 --> 00:04:40.617]  Also, fingers, eyes, DNA, x-ray, behavior, rubbish, spending, habits, meal choices.
[00:04:41.057 --> 00:04:43.878]  Surveilled Brits reduce to the sum of their
[00:04:45.549 --> 00:04:59.145]  Profile parts good article by Aaron Dyche today very lengthy Also, we'll finally get to my comments on Apocalypto opening in theaters nationwide tomorrow And a lot more stay with us
[00:05:04.042 --> 00:05:07.244]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:07.585 --> 00:05:09.506]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:09.886 --> 00:05:17.572]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.232 --> 00:05:25.297]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.697 --> 00:05:32.562]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:05:33.058 --> 00:05:37.100]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.901]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:43.062]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.642 --> 00:05:47.564]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:54.724 --> 00:07:07.554]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[00:07:07.975 --> 00:07:12.698]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[00:07:13.119 --> 00:07:15.741]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:07:16.241 --> 00:07:19.584]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:07:20.402 --> 00:07:24.725]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:07:25.166 --> 00:07:28.348]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:31.791]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:07:32.569 --> 00:07:34.710]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.511]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[00:07:36.531 --> 00:07:36.631]  U.S.
[00:07:36.731 --> 00:07:38.952]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[00:07:38.972 --> 00:07:39.252]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[00:07:39.272 --> 00:07:40.152]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[00:07:40.172 --> 00:07:40.693]  Ask for George.
[00:08:01.109 --> 00:08:06.712]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:30.124]  Alright, we've got a son of one of the top admirals out in the Pacific when Pearl Harbor took place, joining us.
[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:50.216]  Coming up later in the second hour and then we have Judge Napolitano coming on to talk about his new book that breaks down how America is turning into a complete police state and our freedoms and the bedrock of what this country is.
[00:08:50.256 --> 00:08:58.984]  Its very soul is dissipating like vapors at dawn when the first rays of light strike it.
[00:08:59.745 --> 00:09:02.227]  So we'll be talking to him in the third hour.
[00:09:02.247 --> 00:09:05.309]  We'll also have open phones on this December 7th.
[00:09:05.429 --> 00:09:08.671]  Yes, it's the anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack.
[00:09:09.271 --> 00:09:10.472]  December 7th.
[00:09:12.313 --> 00:09:14.215]  A day that will live in infamy.
[00:09:14.235 --> 00:09:15.455]  A staged event.
[00:09:16.356 --> 00:09:20.339]  We'll be discussing that provocateur-ed event coming up in the next hour.
[00:09:20.599 --> 00:09:21.940]  Let me just get into this first.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.521]  Oh, and I should have told you this earlier, John, during the break.
[00:09:24.541 --> 00:09:26.803]  Will you go find the Mercury's Good for Your Brain clip?
[00:09:27.532 --> 00:09:29.313]  We play that every month or so when this comes up.
[00:09:29.353 --> 00:09:31.074]  Because, again, don't believe us.
[00:09:31.114 --> 00:09:33.436]  We're radicals that say mercury is bad for your brain.
[00:09:34.237 --> 00:09:44.443]  We actually post electron microscope video of what happens when just minute particles of major universities have done studies on this.
[00:09:44.503 --> 00:09:51.128]  We show you their electron microscope video where when mercury
[00:09:52.606 --> 00:09:55.989]  comes in contact with neurons in the brain.
[00:09:56.009 --> 00:10:00.953]  It doesn't just do what normal heavy metals do, where it just toxifies them and kills them.
[00:10:01.313 --> 00:10:04.476]  It causes an electrochemical explosion.
[00:10:05.136 --> 00:10:12.002]  It's the only metal, I guess you could call mercury a metal that's akin to it,
[00:10:13.157 --> 00:10:13.598]  Thank you.
[00:10:34.784 --> 00:10:38.626]  I'm telling you what top scientists, major universities have said.
[00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:41.668]  So you can go to all the experts and find out and really become an expert yourself.
[00:10:59.663 --> 00:11:00.984]  But just don't believe me.
[00:11:01.044 --> 00:11:02.404]  Mercury really is bad for you.
[00:11:03.425 --> 00:11:05.465]  It's particularly bad.
[00:11:06.526 --> 00:11:09.007]  Because again, it doesn't just toxify and build up plaques.
[00:11:09.607 --> 00:11:15.909]  Normally heavy metals will build up against cells, kill them, but don't cause them to basically short and explode.
[00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:19.311]  And it doesn't have the corrosive effect that just continues eating through.
[00:11:19.351 --> 00:11:27.394]  I mean, one little particle of mercury just continues on its merry way eating through your brain cells continually.
[00:11:29.279 --> 00:11:44.066]  Very scary stuff, and we've had scientists, we've had medical doctors on, we've had folks that study the brain, I guess the neuroscientist, and so to boil it down and not be so long-winded, my trademark,
[00:11:45.029 --> 00:12:03.110]  It is particularly bad in the brain and causes an electrochemical, electrical reaction that short circuits and kills cells at a much more rapid rate than other metals and other toxins.
[00:12:04.384 --> 00:12:08.627]  So, FDA rejects new limits on mercury in vaccines.
[00:12:09.247 --> 00:12:12.449]  Group petitioned government to restrict use of controversial preservatives.
[00:12:12.469 --> 00:12:13.570]  This is the Associated Press.
[00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:16.812]  But before we do that, here is CBS News locally, K.I.
[00:12:16.852 --> 00:12:24.597]  in Austin, three years ago, and simultaneously in every major CBS around the country, because I went and spot-checked it when I saw this.
[00:12:25.117 --> 00:12:27.979]  I knew that it was little news packets that the
[00:12:29.159 --> 00:12:29.560]  That's right.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.422]  Mercury containing vaccines may have on kids.
[00:12:53.442 --> 00:12:55.323]  A life-saving device wins over-the-counter approval by the FDA.
[00:13:12.433 --> 00:13:14.475]  And sick of your glasses and contact lenses?
[00:13:14.575 --> 00:13:17.238]  A new corrective eye surgery is approved today.
[00:13:17.258 --> 00:13:20.721]  Here's tonight's medical headlines with medical watch reporter Seema Mathur.
[00:13:23.311 --> 00:13:29.295]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[00:13:29.755 --> 00:13:36.179]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives and vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[00:13:36.199 --> 00:13:43.624]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[00:13:45.585 --> 00:13:49.047]  Now, the bigger story here isn't just the mercury.
[00:13:49.267 --> 00:13:50.528]  I'll get back to that in a minute.
[00:13:50.548 --> 00:13:51.649]  I don't talk enough about this.
[00:13:52.917 --> 00:14:04.726]  In 1999, Fox News, CBS, and NBC all announced they were going to merge their news gathering into the CBS Broadcast Center in Manhattan.
[00:14:05.827 --> 00:14:15.995]  And so if you wonder where CIA and Defense Intel and higher PR, you know, InfoWare, Mercs, mercenaries are working, that's one of the main nodes.
[00:14:18.033 --> 00:14:22.638]  And that piece you just heard is clearly written by a PSYOP specialist.
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.301]  Let me tell you why we know that.
[00:14:26.182 --> 00:14:30.427]  Notice that they talk about something positive.
[00:14:30.948 --> 00:14:32.770]  Oh, there's a life-saving development.
[00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:36.614]  And they talk about, hey, we've got something to save you money and help you out.
[00:14:37.865 --> 00:14:40.287]  You know, with your eyes, another great development.
[00:14:40.827 --> 00:14:46.270]  And right in the middle of that, real fast, oh, and Mercury's good for you, too.
[00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:48.271]  So they're giving you good news here.
[00:14:49.532 --> 00:14:54.454]  You see, I mean, that's just simple, basic propaganda.
[00:14:54.555 --> 00:14:58.437]  And we know it came out of CBS Broadcast Center in Manhattan.
[00:14:59.357 --> 00:15:00.538]  Now, I knew that when I heard it.
[00:15:01.058 --> 00:15:02.379]  I have the videotape around here.
[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:19.716]  When I saw it, Mike comes in with it, we play it on the local TV show, we analyze it, and I knew that when I got home that night, this is key, I knew when I typed in their headline that I would see it all over the country, and literally hundreds and hundreds, and I quit looking after 10, 15 deep in the search.
[00:15:21.627 --> 00:15:22.568]  You know how on Google it says 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10?
[00:15:23.388 --> 00:15:25.149]  I mean, I went deep.
[00:15:25.529 --> 00:15:31.253]  And it was the same headline, same report, and I tracked it back to CBS Broadcast Center.
[00:15:31.733 --> 00:15:33.354]  And again, they package these reports.
[00:15:33.914 --> 00:15:37.556]  They are T1ed now, not so much satellited anymore.
[00:15:37.976 --> 00:15:39.978]  They are T1ed into your local station.
[00:15:40.378 --> 00:15:49.063]  And there's really no local news other than a few reporters that go out and show a wreck or some opening of a new city building or a library or some crime story.
[00:15:49.803 --> 00:15:51.384]  And maybe some local sports.
[00:15:51.444 --> 00:15:52.124]  That's local.
[00:15:52.484 --> 00:16:00.107]  But key news on health, the war, politics, nationally, internationally, that is all canned.
[00:16:00.787 --> 00:16:10.511]  And that is all then, this has been going on for about eight, nine years, but it got really bad in 2000 when they set up the CBS Broadcast Center in Manhattan for this news gathering.
[00:16:11.592 --> 00:16:12.812]  I forget the exact name.
[00:16:13.032 --> 00:16:14.513]  The grouping has a name.
[00:16:15.373 --> 00:16:16.694]  It was all over the news at the time.
[00:16:16.714 --> 00:16:17.594]  They were very proud of it.
[00:16:19.895 --> 00:16:21.516]  It'll pop in my head in a second.
[00:16:22.276 --> 00:16:27.578]  But this shows the packaging of it.
[00:16:29.879 --> 00:16:34.120]  And it's the same thing every year right before school starts, about a month before.
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:35.240]  It's the law!
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.161]  You'll be arrested if you don't vaccinate!
[00:16:37.893 --> 00:16:53.609]  And you can go take the ABC, the CBS, the NBC, the Fox headline, you can type it in and there it will be, the exact headline or the similar headline, and then the text, the exact same words, even with different names on it, and it's amazing!
[00:16:55.660 --> 00:17:02.072]  Of course there is no law you have to vaccinate your children, but they are just telling you over and over and over.
[00:17:02.433 --> 00:17:06.580]  And then to create the illusion that it's a law, they play a sophisticated fraud.
[00:17:06.901 --> 00:17:08.284]  Think about the magnitude of this.
[00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:17.736]  They run a scam where the school kicks your child out because they haven't been vaccinated because it's a policy, not a law.
[00:17:18.217 --> 00:17:31.046]  They don't tell you that under federal and state law, there is a vaccine waiver, which you don't even really have to sign on to, but then the school has to immediately allow your child back in if you do sign it.
[00:17:32.282 --> 00:17:33.645]  Again, it's like 501c3.
[00:17:33.705 --> 00:17:41.944]  Nobody ever had to get that back in the 50s when they started it, and then LBJ codified it into the Federal Register in the 60s.
[00:17:43.692 --> 00:17:45.012]  Churches didn't have to have that.
[00:17:45.613 --> 00:18:02.657]  But as soon as everyone is prepared, and then it's custom, then they start announcing it's the law, and then people go and adopt it, and then they use these civil courts, which are color of law, these maritime admiralty courts, they call themselves administrative law, to then go after you.
[00:18:02.717 --> 00:18:04.618]  I mean, it's just, it's total crime.
[00:18:05.665 --> 00:18:14.994]  And an example of this fraud, for police out there that are rolling their eyes and don't get this, how bureaucrats are involved in a massive hoax.
[00:18:15.475 --> 00:18:17.637]  Now believe me, the prosecutors and judges know this.
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:21.721]  But the cops and others don't.
[00:18:22.161 --> 00:18:23.302]  So I want to tell you about the hoax.
[00:18:23.663 --> 00:18:25.204]  Here's an example of the hoax.
[00:18:25.244 --> 00:18:29.008]  Okay, one small little part of it, you can go vet and verify right now.
[00:18:29.028 --> 00:18:30.309]  Okay?
[00:18:32.509 --> 00:18:41.755]  There is no law you have to take vaccines, but the school will claim that it is their policy, but then you'll go read state law.
[00:18:41.795 --> 00:18:42.736]  This is nationwide.
[00:18:43.997 --> 00:18:46.619]  You can't kick somebody out for a policy.
[00:18:47.059 --> 00:18:48.500]  You can't expel or suspend.
[00:18:49.329 --> 00:18:56.334]  Okay, they have to be violating some base state law, which then there's a policy written to follow the law.
[00:18:56.354 --> 00:18:56.774]  No, no, no, no.
[00:18:57.094 --> 00:19:04.319]  But you can't have a clear policy saying you'll be expended or expelled if you don't take the prescribed number of vaccines.
[00:19:04.359 --> 00:19:13.005]  It was 20-something a few years ago, then 30-something, and now next year they're saying it's going to be 45 vaccines on average right here in Texas.
[00:19:13.025 --> 00:19:14.346]  That's the number most states have that number.
[00:19:14.606 --> 00:19:15.447]  Some have even higher.
[00:19:15.487 --> 00:19:16.968]  It's all federally written guidelines.
[00:19:17.188 --> 00:19:18.889]  Again, guidelines, not laws.
[00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:48.693]  They expel your child, they suspend your child, and then, because, and boy this is great alchemy, I mean I don't know how they do this, they then say it's criminal truancy, and then they turn you over to truancy court, when they triggered the expulsion, and then they say, on the news, oh the child, the parent was arrested for not taking the vaccines.
[00:19:50.388 --> 00:19:51.233]  See how that works?
[00:19:52.078 --> 00:19:53.164]  Very slick!
[00:19:54.131 --> 00:19:55.112]  Very slick!
[00:19:55.532 --> 00:19:56.273]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:59.876 --> 00:20:00.336]  Gold.
[00:20:00.656 --> 00:20:01.937]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:20:02.198 --> 00:20:08.303]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:20:08.483 --> 00:20:12.306]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:20:12.646 --> 00:20:14.548]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:20:14.588 --> 00:20:16.890]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:23.695]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker
[00:20:23.715 --> 00:20:24.395]  We're good to go.
[00:20:41.664 --> 00:20:42.225]  I think so.
[00:20:59.202 --> 00:21:04.283]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:21:04.344 --> 00:21:11.646]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:21:11.806 --> 00:21:22.429]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[00:21:22.649 --> 00:21:27.170]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:32.472]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[00:21:32.672 --> 00:21:35.613]  Yeah, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:21:35.833 --> 00:21:45.697]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[00:22:02.836 --> 00:22:07.277]  Did you know that Russia sponsored a terrorist training camp in Havana, Cuba in 1966?
[00:22:07.858 --> 00:22:13.519]  In this camp, they planned terrorist activity on every continent, including the United States.
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:18.021]  Have we seen terrorist activities on every continent just as they planned?

[00:23:07.879 --> 00:23:16.305]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.

[00:24:59.628 --> 00:25:00.372]  Yeah.
[00:25:28.958 --> 00:25:57.900]  I see a woman in the night With a baby in her hand There's an old street light Near a garbage can And now she puts the kid away Gonna get a hit She hates the life and what she does with it And there's one more kid
[00:26:05.606 --> 00:26:06.346]  Welcome back.
[00:26:08.207 --> 00:26:19.771]  Now, I tell you, I didn't mean to play two minutes of that song, but every time I hear it, there's another kid that'll never get to go to school, never get to have friends, never get to be cool.
[00:26:20.131 --> 00:26:21.612]  That's what the New World Order does.
[00:26:21.652 --> 00:26:27.434]  They ruin society because they're threatened by free, independent, happy populations.
[00:26:27.474 --> 00:26:28.314]  They want you weak.
[00:26:28.374 --> 00:26:29.255]  They want you dependent.
[00:26:29.295 --> 00:26:30.395]  They want you in the system.
[00:26:31.411 --> 00:26:33.413]  Now, let's be clear about this.
[00:26:33.893 --> 00:26:36.095]  There is no law that you have to take vaccines.
[00:26:37.036 --> 00:26:41.599]  But they play a trick by kicking you out of school, then they charge you with truancy.
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.541]  That's how they go after you.
[00:26:43.561 --> 00:26:51.728]  And they'll have a few publicized cases in every town, every major city, and they'll, oh look, this parent got arrested, this child got arrested, no vaccines.
[00:26:52.364 --> 00:26:59.491]  And I've been on the air and talked about this, and I've had teachers call and go, yeah, well, we know, but we know it's not illegal, but we need to make everybody because it keeps them safe.
[00:26:59.511 --> 00:27:04.915]  And I go, oh, so now you lie because it's for the better good, isn't it?
[00:27:07.418 --> 00:27:12.682]  It's sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick.
[00:27:13.984 --> 00:27:15.085]  But let me expand on that.
[00:27:15.125 --> 00:27:16.946]  How did I learn about this scam?
[00:27:17.126 --> 00:27:18.748]  It was totally separate from vaccines.
[00:27:19.881 --> 00:27:24.424]  In 1998, they had the Absence Student Assistance.
[00:27:24.504 --> 00:27:26.285]  It's like the IRS calls itself a service.
[00:27:26.846 --> 00:27:29.648]  The Absence Student Assistance Program.
[00:27:30.168 --> 00:27:35.011]  And it was a federally written grant and program being, quote, piloted in Austin.
[00:27:35.031 --> 00:27:36.732]  They always say, oh, you've been chosen.
[00:27:37.052 --> 00:27:38.713]  Hundreds of school districts were doing it at the time.
[00:27:38.974 --> 00:27:40.855]  Now it's all over the country under different names.
[00:27:41.495 --> 00:27:42.756]  Sometimes under the name ASAP.
[00:27:44.597 --> 00:27:48.400]  And the reason we knew about it is this happened to Mike Hanson's son.
[00:27:51.105 --> 00:28:02.013]  And it happened to neighbors, and it happened to everybody that we knew that had children, because the hunger of the state to get people in the system was such that they couldn't get real truancies.
[00:28:03.314 --> 00:28:04.355]  In fact, I was amazed.
[00:28:04.615 --> 00:28:07.817]  Criminal truancy was 14 absences at that time.
[00:28:07.837 --> 00:28:10.639]  I haven't seen the state law since then.
[00:28:10.659 --> 00:28:13.321]  14 absences, unexcused, in a semester.
[00:28:13.541 --> 00:28:14.362]  That's criminal.
[00:28:15.186 --> 00:28:18.389]  Okay, and that's pretty reasonable, at least on the surface.
[00:28:18.829 --> 00:28:19.850]  Fourteen times!
[00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:21.451]  You are definitely truant, baby!
[00:28:21.471 --> 00:28:32.781]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[00:28:33.905 --> 00:28:41.389]  I remember times when my mom, my dad, and me got the flu, and we weren't, you know, nobody went to work for two or three days, I didn't go to school, and then, you know, then they finally got a note.
[00:28:41.829 --> 00:28:42.630]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:50.554]  There, there are CPS workers with constables or sheriff's deputies at your door before the day is over.
[00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:54.451]  I remember back when I was about, was it ten?
[00:28:54.831 --> 00:28:55.652]  We all had the flu.
[00:28:55.672 --> 00:28:57.393]  We're all, my sister hadn't come along yet.
[00:28:57.773 --> 00:28:59.154]  We're all crawling around the floor.
[00:28:59.174 --> 00:29:00.314]  Neighbors got to come over and help us.
[00:29:00.334 --> 00:29:01.175]  We all had the flu so bad.
[00:29:01.215 --> 00:29:06.678]  Can you imagine CPS at your door trying to knock it down because you're all inside sick?
[00:29:07.698 --> 00:29:10.960]  See, that's how out of control all this is, but it gets worse.
[00:29:12.761 --> 00:29:19.204]  They were charging people with criminal truancy when the state law said fourteen for one.
[00:29:19.464 --> 00:29:20.525]  And then we found out
[00:29:21.329 --> 00:29:23.291]  Then we found out something even worse.
[00:29:23.311 --> 00:29:28.617]  See, they were charging people when there was no law.
[00:29:30.019 --> 00:29:34.924]  You'll be surprised some people go to prison for not even violating one of their laws.
[00:29:35.424 --> 00:29:36.626]  As if there isn't enough laws.
[00:29:37.567 --> 00:29:38.528]  But it gets worse.
[00:29:39.148 --> 00:29:41.551]  And I'll tell you about that at the end of the vaccines when we return.
[00:29:41.791 --> 00:29:42.792]  Then get into world news.
[00:29:42.812 --> 00:29:43.293]  Stay with me.
[00:29:49.992 --> 00:29:52.976]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.917 --> 00:29:56.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:27.119 --> 00:31:27.420]  government.

[00:32:01.409 --> 00:32:02.210]  What's wrong?
[00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:03.511]  I am so tired.
[00:32:03.571 --> 00:32:06.052]  I just get so hot at night and can't sleep.
[00:32:06.172 --> 00:32:07.253]  I have tried everything.
[00:32:07.313 --> 00:32:09.074]  All kinds of fans, sheets, pillows.
[00:32:09.234 --> 00:32:10.375]  You name it, I've tried it.
[00:32:10.515 --> 00:32:12.817]  My husband has always been a hot sleeper.
[00:32:12.977 --> 00:32:14.538]  He's never had a good night's sleep.

[00:32:59.901 --> 00:33:04.469]  I was sitting in traffic, listening to the radio
[00:33:15.769 --> 00:33:21.631]  George Strait was singin' the seashores of old Mexico.
[00:33:22.131 --> 00:33:26.473]  It sounded so good, I got an idea.
[00:33:26.493 --> 00:33:30.454]  I'm gonna go there since they're all over here.
[00:33:30.795 --> 00:33:35.116]  The Lone Star State should be renamed Texico.
[00:33:38.378 --> 00:34:00.141]  So long Texas, hello Mexico I'm gonna swim the Rio Grande at El Paso I'm leaving tonight, I ain't gonna pack I'm only taking the clothes on my back
[00:34:00.931 --> 00:34:04.932]  So long Texas, hello Mexico.
[00:34:07.133 --> 00:34:19.897]  I'll drive a rattle-trap car with no liability.
[00:34:22.958 --> 00:34:27.459]  I'll demand equal rights, though I'm there illegally.
[00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:34.571]  I'll protest in the streets till they finally grant them.
[00:34:34.591 --> 00:34:37.872]  Sing English words to their national anthem.
[00:34:38.152 --> 00:34:45.894]  Hey Vincente, what's right for your people should be right for me.
[00:34:45.934 --> 00:34:51.096]  There's no controlling that tide that keeps rolling across the line.
[00:34:52.797 --> 00:34:58.819]  This old Texas cowboy feels like my home state's no longer mine.
[00:35:00.889 --> 00:35:12.494]  So long Texas, hello Mexico I'm gonna swim the Rio Grande at El Paso
[00:35:15.613 --> 00:35:16.935]  I'm leaving tonight.
[00:35:16.955 --> 00:35:18.896]  I ain't gonna pack.
[00:35:19.577 --> 00:35:22.700]  I'm only taking the clothes on my back.
[00:35:23.401 --> 00:35:24.702]  So long, Texas.
[00:35:24.782 --> 00:35:28.406]  Hello, Mexico!
[00:35:31.449 --> 00:35:34.291]  Yep, turnabout's a fair play.
[00:35:35.312 --> 00:35:39.617]  Heck, I already love the food and tequila.
[00:35:41.025 --> 00:35:46.227]  I'm going to fly that long star flag at Old Flora every day.
[00:35:46.488 --> 00:35:49.249]  I'm going to celebrate every 4th of July.
[00:35:49.989 --> 00:35:53.771]  I'm going to make them print them forms in English just for me.
[00:35:53.811 --> 00:35:56.912]  I'm going to marry me a pretty signature reader.
[00:35:56.932 --> 00:36:01.714]  We're going to have free medical care and free education for all our kids.
[00:36:03.667 --> 00:36:06.590]  Playing my old guitar is the only other skill I got.
[00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:12.356]  I wonder if I'll see old George Strait over there.
[00:36:12.396 --> 00:36:13.076]  Hey, gringo!
[00:36:13.457 --> 00:36:15.258]  You gonna be with me the long way, man!
[00:36:15.339 --> 00:36:16.500]  Yeah, yeah, I know.
[00:36:17.421 --> 00:36:18.021]  Hey, amigo!
[00:36:19.182 --> 00:36:19.823]  Hey, amigo!
[00:36:21.004 --> 00:36:22.205]  You got a sister?
[00:36:23.006 --> 00:36:26.449]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:32.472]  Yeah, they'd break your jaw, gouge your eyes out, and pour Tabasco sauce down your nose.
[00:36:32.512 --> 00:36:33.372]  That's how they torture you.
[00:36:33.412 --> 00:36:35.052]  They torture most people who go to their jails.
[00:36:35.473 --> 00:36:38.654]  They find anything illegal, even an old .22 shell under your seat.
[00:36:39.114 --> 00:36:42.495]  They'll suck every dime out of your family, and they'll put you in a dirt floor jail.
[00:36:43.315 --> 00:36:44.035]  How do you like that?
[00:36:44.095 --> 00:36:48.437]  You ask anybody to do anything in English in a court proceeding, you'll never be seen again.
[00:36:49.338 --> 00:36:56.501]  They'll take you out in the desert and blow the back of your head off and throw you in a shallow grave like they do right over most of the Texas border.
[00:36:56.541 --> 00:37:01.783]  What, in two separate towns they've dug up over a hundred bodies on both sides of women they like to rape to death and kill?
[00:37:03.084 --> 00:37:03.404]  Yeah!
[00:37:04.104 --> 00:37:06.505]  But that's all kept real quiet, isn't it?
[00:37:07.285 --> 00:37:16.249]  It's kept real quiet until now the Associated Press does report that illegal aliens don't have to show ID
[00:37:17.432 --> 00:37:21.776]  Illegal aliens don't have to do anything to get bank accounts and housing loans.
[00:37:22.376 --> 00:37:23.397]  And why is that?
[00:37:24.938 --> 00:37:28.541]  Because the New World Order wants to break down both of our countries.
[00:37:29.182 --> 00:37:31.344]  Now the Mexican people are great people.
[00:37:31.584 --> 00:37:34.226]  Wonderful, hard-working, good people.
[00:37:35.907 --> 00:37:40.491]  But their government is totally and completely corrupt.
[00:37:41.032 --> 00:37:43.694]  Vicente Fox was a known CIA asset.
[00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:47.250]  They recruited him right out of the Coca-Cola company.
[00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:51.913]  The new right-wing guy they've put in clearly lost the election by a landslide.
[00:37:52.353 --> 00:37:53.754]  The people have tried to revolt.
[00:37:54.454 --> 00:38:00.577]  The more courage the American people have in stolen elections, and they've been machine-gunning them in the streets, killing American reporters.
[00:38:03.338 --> 00:38:09.882]  So I don't blame the Mexican people for wanting to come up here and have a better life and take care of their families.
[00:38:11.593 --> 00:38:19.041]  But I do have a problem with the Los Zetas drug gangs controlled by our own government.
[00:38:19.182 --> 00:38:27.451]  Celica Stillo, the head of the DEA in Latin America, Vietnam veteran, police officer, he's done it all, border patrol, he's worked all the jobs, folks.
[00:38:28.348 --> 00:38:36.772]  And he's told you right here, Los Zetas killing and kidnapping and murdering the Mexican people and the American people works for the U.S.
[00:38:37.712 --> 00:38:38.152]  government.
[00:38:38.553 --> 00:38:45.656]  Works for the CIA, just like the death squads they hired in Nicaragua and El Salvador and Colombia and Honduras.
[00:38:46.511 --> 00:38:58.496]  And two years after Celica Stillo, three years ago, told you about it, about a year ago, it was in the news, that they've hired thousands of former Death Squad operatives and their commanders to take them to Iraq!
[00:39:01.757 --> 00:39:06.559]  It's absolutely horrible what's happened.
[00:39:06.759 --> 00:39:13.281]  And I didn't know we had that song in the queue rotating and now I've already been diverted off into another subject.
[00:39:14.822 --> 00:39:15.262]  And it is...
[00:39:17.102 --> 00:39:18.763]  I mean, we know George Bush is evil, right?
[00:39:18.903 --> 00:39:19.123]  Right?
[00:39:19.383 --> 00:39:21.364]  Well, he's for total blanket amnesty and open borders.
[00:39:23.165 --> 00:39:24.766]  By the way, people keep getting their numbers wrong.
[00:39:24.806 --> 00:39:31.409]  There are 90 plus million Mexicans, and that's an old census from 2000, in Mexico.
[00:39:31.729 --> 00:39:34.050]  Their population just 30 years ago was 60 million.
[00:39:35.151 --> 00:39:37.012]  Okay, 30 million illegals are here now.
[00:39:38.852 --> 00:39:44.055]  And a foreign liberation theology, you could, just like Greg Palast told you, peak oil for the liberals,
[00:39:44.804 --> 00:39:49.645]  Was written up by Dutch Rochelle ten years ago and the liberals think, oh there's no more oil, we've got to have a global tax?
[00:39:52.205 --> 00:40:04.088]  Well, just like that was created, that fake revolution, they went and told, and took existing legends and existing proofs in some cases, and told the Mexicans, hey all your problems are because of America!
[00:40:04.768 --> 00:40:11.669]  And in part, that is partially true, a lot of the problems were because Chase Manhattan and Citibank teamed up with the elites of Mexico to dominate and
[00:40:12.811 --> 00:40:18.893]  Dispossess their populations and kick the indigenous populations off of little cornfields and drive them up to Mexico City.
[00:40:20.034 --> 00:40:24.855]  UN biospheres are down there which they grabbed their land the last 20 years and now they sell to the gringos.
[00:40:24.875 --> 00:40:31.758]  The gringos from Italy, Germany, they're really the biggest grouper moving down to areas of Mexico taking over the property that was stolen from the indigenous.
[00:40:31.778 --> 00:40:32.458]  They don't even know it.
[00:40:33.339 --> 00:40:34.539]  People buying it don't even know it.
[00:40:35.962 --> 00:40:45.333]  They drive them all up to Mexico City where half the population of 33 million in that city alone lives literally in cardboard shantytowns next to black sludge rivers.
[00:40:45.373 --> 00:40:46.874]  I mean they're actually like black yogurt.
[00:40:46.894 --> 00:40:48.176]  I've seen footage of it.
[00:40:48.336 --> 00:40:49.457]  Teams that have gone down there.
[00:40:49.757 --> 00:40:50.558]  Human rights groups.
[00:40:50.739 --> 00:40:52.781]  And so of course they'll do anything to get up here!
[00:40:54.341 --> 00:40:56.283]  But what does the fake left do once they get here?
[00:40:56.323 --> 00:40:59.065]  They tell them, Oh, the Southwest belongs to Mexico.
[00:40:59.085 --> 00:40:59.946]  We need to break it off.
[00:40:59.966 --> 00:41:01.327]  That's all part of North American Union.
[00:41:01.527 --> 00:41:13.437]  It's part of creating like a French separatist group, like in Canada, to then divide the country further, to then reconfigure it back into a North American Union, where they then have, quote, autonomous zones, just like they're breaking Iraq into three parts.
[00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:23.235]  So get past the pride and the, you know, you've been downtrodden and they've given you a false pride that this is really Mexico and so you're going to get the gringo and the gringo did it all to you.
[00:41:23.595 --> 00:41:35.983]  No, there are a lot of stupid gringos who are racist and think they're part of the elite so they serve the elite but they're not part of the elite and the elite is using you against the United States.
[00:41:39.485 --> 00:41:40.926]  And so you've got to get sophisticated.
[00:41:41.146 --> 00:41:42.087]  All Americans do.
[00:41:42.367 --> 00:41:44.408]  All foreigners in this country need to get sophisticated.
[00:41:46.375 --> 00:41:50.016]  And realize, open borders are the death of this country.
[00:41:50.296 --> 00:42:08.240]  And any republic, any Bill of Rights that was left, and Lord knows this country hadn't been perfect, but the elite do hate it, and do hate that Bill of Rights, and do hate the middle class, because anybody who's got enough money to be independent, and who can travel, and who can not be on the basic dole, they don't like.
[00:42:09.821 --> 00:42:14.262]  So they like the illegals to drive down the wages, they like the illegals to balkanize the nation,
[00:42:14.918 --> 00:42:19.439]  They like the illegals because through their leftist control groups they can give the order and every U.S.
[00:42:19.459 --> 00:42:20.700]  city will burn to the ground.
[00:42:24.881 --> 00:42:26.201]  So it's divide and conquer.
[00:42:26.222 --> 00:42:31.823]  The globalists do whatever they can to break down nation states, whatever they can to destroy middle classes, and they're doing a good job of it.
[00:42:34.224 --> 00:42:34.524]  Okay?
[00:42:34.844 --> 00:42:35.965]  Now that's the game plan.
[00:42:36.345 --> 00:42:37.185]  That's what's happening.
[00:42:39.286 --> 00:42:43.787]  And the Democrats teamed up with Bush are going to have total amnesty next year if we don't stop them somehow.
[00:42:44.983 --> 00:42:46.404]  I'm calling it a guest worker program.
[00:42:46.424 --> 00:42:47.805]  We'll have a North American ID card.
[00:42:47.825 --> 00:42:49.447]  They're already rolling the new U.S.
[00:42:49.547 --> 00:42:50.547]  ID card into that.
[00:42:51.028 --> 00:42:51.888]  It's all official.
[00:42:51.928 --> 00:42:53.410]  It's all public if you know where to look.
[00:42:55.972 --> 00:42:56.872]  And that's the bottom line.
[00:42:59.054 --> 00:42:59.574]  Hey, listen.
[00:42:59.675 --> 00:43:02.156]  I don't care if the Southwest is a majority Hispanic.
[00:43:02.677 --> 00:43:08.842]  As long as they're pro-gun, anti-UN, anti-New World Order.
[00:43:08.982 --> 00:43:11.144]  I could absolutely care less.
[00:43:13.225 --> 00:43:14.126]  But I do care
[00:43:15.154 --> 00:43:21.617]  That you have a majority in the Southwest, and I would say about half of that majority, thinks this is Mexico.
[00:43:24.538 --> 00:43:29.941]  I mean, I go up and I talk to the illegals, I talk to naturalized, and it's just all, yeah, this is Mexico, so what?
[00:43:32.382 --> 00:43:33.502]  Yeah, we're taking over.
[00:43:33.542 --> 00:43:35.043]  And I'm like, you're not taking anything over.
[00:43:35.823 --> 00:43:44.547]  You're being used to drive down the wages and break down the country and then have some balkanized, sectarian, internal race tension.
[00:43:48.021 --> 00:43:53.406]  What the New World Order can't stand, as I said yesterday and the day before, is us coming together.
[00:43:54.106 --> 00:43:57.729]  At the same time, Mexicans from Mexico, they know what a devalued dollar means.
[00:43:58.070 --> 00:43:59.511]  They know about the global elite.
[00:44:00.191 --> 00:44:12.622]  They are smarter and more informed, in almost every case, with common sense and ingenuity than the American people, who become fat and decadent, and I mean fat psychologically, I mean just slovenly, myself included.
[00:44:15.302 --> 00:44:16.683]  Adversity does that to people.
[00:44:17.084 --> 00:44:19.406]  But you watch what happens to these Mexican immigrants.
[00:44:19.766 --> 00:44:25.711]  Just one generation here, their kids are totally spoiled rotten, just like everybody else's children.
[00:44:26.011 --> 00:44:32.196]  Because this current culture, this current consumer culture, destroys families and societies.
[00:44:32.617 --> 00:44:43.426]  Even the incredibly strong Mexican culture, with its familia, its raza, is being annihilated by the new world order once it gets here, and forged into the amalgam
[00:44:44.951 --> 00:44:47.433]  Of the mind-numb zombies we become.
[00:44:49.135 --> 00:44:49.855]  And that's my message.
[00:44:49.875 --> 00:44:51.377]  Okay, I've already been diverted off.
[00:44:51.437 --> 00:44:53.899]  I've got a bunch of news I want to get to before these guests come up.
[00:44:53.919 --> 00:44:55.280]  That's why we're not taking calls right now.
[00:44:57.321 --> 00:44:59.583]  So, to put it in a nutshell, going back to the vaccines.
[00:44:59.623 --> 00:45:01.204]  They tell you it's the law, you've got to take vaccines.
[00:45:01.264 --> 00:45:10.192]  It's not really true, but to create the illusion of arrest, they suspend or expel the students, then charge them with truancy crimes, and then announce that they were arrested because of not taking vaccines.
[00:45:11.332 --> 00:45:11.913]  Very slick.
[00:45:12.941 --> 00:45:14.421]  But then you go look at the truancy law.
[00:45:14.521 --> 00:45:18.882]  It's 14 absences that are unexcused.
[00:45:19.503 --> 00:45:34.226]  But they are sending CPS with constables and others out right here in Austin with the ASAP program on the first unexcused absence by the end of the day because the parents kept their child home and were too busy or they were sick too and didn't call.
[00:45:34.833 --> 00:45:37.556]  You see, it's the nanny state where, you know, in D.C.
[00:45:37.576 --> 00:45:43.923]  a little girl gets off one stop before her stop to get a hamburger, remember that was the news, and so they arrest her.
[00:45:48.748 --> 00:45:54.454]  Or somebody's got a cricket ball on the train in their suit, you know, going to play a game, so they get a ticket.
[00:45:56.466 --> 00:45:59.307]  You know, you forgot your driver's license in your car so they arrest you.
[00:45:59.327 --> 00:46:00.327]  You're not wearing your seatbelt.
[00:46:00.648 --> 00:46:02.428]  It's about getting everybody into the system.
[00:46:03.108 --> 00:46:04.669]  But now it's when there's not even a law.
[00:46:05.709 --> 00:46:23.675]  Then under the ASAP program, Absence Student Assistance Program, three absences, excuse me, three tardies, and by the way folks, I used to have to, when I was in high school, carry my books in a big bag.
[00:46:24.056 --> 00:46:25.076]  In a leather backpack.
[00:46:27.438 --> 00:46:28.159]  Love that backpack.
[00:46:28.199 --> 00:46:28.699]  Where is it?
[00:46:29.059 --> 00:46:30.560]  Black leather from Norway my mom bought me.
[00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:31.641]  It's got a Viking ship on it.
[00:46:31.941 --> 00:46:32.422]  Side issue.
[00:46:33.282 --> 00:46:34.063]  It's in my garage.
[00:46:35.464 --> 00:46:36.104]  Great backpack.
[00:46:37.025 --> 00:46:38.826]  I would have to go into Anderson High School.
[00:46:38.886 --> 00:46:39.567]  Big high school.
[00:46:40.207 --> 00:46:45.731]  I would literally, in a five minute break, and I was never tardy.
[00:46:47.216 --> 00:47:15.176]  I would have to carry that bag, and sometimes go to my locker and quickly get stuff, and if I had to, well I wouldn't have time to go to the bathroom to urinate, so I would then go to the class and ask permission to, hey, can I go to the bathroom, and the teachers all like me because I was so good, I was just quiet by the time I was a senior in high school because I just wanted to get out of there, and I would be able to then go relieve myself, because I remember running into the bathroom, and I don't mean to get into detail here, but having to just pressure myself to get
[00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:21.911]  My bladder emptied to run to the class as the bell was ringing.
[00:47:22.151 --> 00:47:29.112]  And people would all come in, you know, 4, 5, 10 people, sometimes more would be, you know, 30 seconds a minute, like the teacher would ignore it.
[00:47:33.433 --> 00:47:34.213]  They were reasonable.
[00:47:34.953 --> 00:47:40.794]  Well, that was 10, 12, 13, 14, almost 15 years ago now.
[00:47:42.275 --> 00:47:43.355]  And hard to believe that long ago.
[00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:45.691]  Not anymore!
[00:47:47.432 --> 00:47:49.774]  You get free tardies!
[00:47:50.715 --> 00:47:52.696]  Because this happened to Justin.
[00:47:54.077 --> 00:47:54.978]  I'm going from memory here.
[00:47:54.998 --> 00:47:55.778]  Mike can call in.
[00:47:56.859 --> 00:47:59.701]  But once, before the day ended, they were there.
[00:48:01.143 --> 00:48:02.504]  And Justin was a good kid.
[00:48:02.524 --> 00:48:05.106]  He's now graduated, married, got a child.
[00:48:07.207 --> 00:48:08.168]  Married a nice senorita.
[00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:14.632]  And it's hard with these little kids, you know, they're adults.
[00:48:15.512 --> 00:48:19.554]  But then it happened again.
[00:48:19.894 --> 00:48:21.015]  That's why we got involved in it.
[00:48:22.056 --> 00:48:24.377]  Where he was late three times in a
[00:48:26.610 --> 00:48:31.412]  And so they started criminal proceedings against Mike.
[00:48:31.493 --> 00:48:37.596]  And I remember Mike went before Judge Gene Mear, who is this psychopath, and they have a whole juvenile justice center named after her.
[00:48:38.116 --> 00:48:47.482]  And this woman, literally, I've seen her on the news, I've seen her in court, she screams at parents and orders them under threat of arrest to sign forms to put their children into probation when there's not even a law.
[00:48:47.782 --> 00:48:49.063]  And through total intimidation,
[00:48:49.723 --> 00:48:53.104]  And now they've extinguished all the blue-collar workers who weren't educated and rolled over.
[00:48:53.324 --> 00:48:56.166]  Now they're into the middle-class people, and they shake and go sign it.
[00:48:56.486 --> 00:48:57.986]  Mike said, go ahead and put me in jail.
[00:48:58.806 --> 00:49:00.067]  She's threatening with contempt.
[00:49:00.547 --> 00:49:04.509]  I was there for one of those meetings, a big battle, and he goes, my son was late three times.
[00:49:04.709 --> 00:49:05.589]  That's not truancy.
[00:49:05.609 --> 00:49:06.389]  Here's the state law.
[00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:10.511]  SIGN IT OR YOU'RE UNDER ARREST FOR CONTEMPT!
[00:49:10.531 --> 00:49:11.791]  I mean, this is the Soviet Union.
[00:49:12.672 --> 00:49:13.612]  Well, we did the smart thing.
[00:49:13.652 --> 00:49:16.233]  We then went to the county commissioners every
[00:49:17.102 --> 00:49:22.005]  Tuesday morning, when they had the meeting, they would send the SWAT team in to try to intimidate us, tell us not to speak.
[00:49:22.085 --> 00:49:22.785]  That's on video.
[00:49:23.086 --> 00:49:25.007]  I'd tell them, we've got to get those old tapes and put them on TV.
[00:49:25.287 --> 00:49:27.548]  I'd tell them I'm going to sue them.
[00:49:27.728 --> 00:49:31.491]  Then they started respecting us and rolled over and then woke up with the First Amendment.
[00:49:31.931 --> 00:49:33.012]  We would get up there and speak.
[00:49:34.453 --> 00:49:37.314]  And we pointed out the state law, we'd read the state law every week.
[00:49:37.694 --> 00:49:43.418]  People started suing and then they, quote, reassessed it and scaled it back and then they tried to follow the state law.
[00:49:44.457 --> 00:49:47.499]  And then last time I heard they were back with it because we can't keep pressure on them.
[00:49:50.361 --> 00:49:51.781]  No law!
[00:49:53.282 --> 00:50:00.927]  Just a butch-cut demon woman up there screaming at people.
[00:50:01.087 --> 00:50:12.394]  We have a video clip of her we put on the web where now she's trained a whole group of judges but it showed her for the newscast at the portable building where they have the court and she's telling the father
[00:50:16.047 --> 00:50:16.687]  You were late.
[00:50:18.188 --> 00:50:20.428]  Now what I'm going to do now is put you on probation.
[00:50:20.508 --> 00:50:21.148]  Sign here.
[00:50:21.228 --> 00:50:22.789]  And the father is groveling.
[00:50:23.089 --> 00:50:24.269]  Okay, thank you so much, ma'am.
[00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.589]  Thank you.
[00:50:24.609 --> 00:50:25.630]  She's like, that's right.
[00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:26.290]  That's right.
[00:50:26.570 --> 00:50:28.110]  I mean, these people are sick.
[00:50:29.211 --> 00:50:30.031]  They're sick.
[00:50:31.151 --> 00:50:32.251]  And these parents don't know.
[00:50:32.291 --> 00:50:33.152]  They don't know the Bill of Rights.
[00:50:33.172 --> 00:50:33.772]  They know nothing.
[00:50:37.413 --> 00:50:38.833]  So that's how they operate.
[00:50:40.074 --> 00:50:44.255]  And then when your child does one thing wrong, they go to juvenile detention.
[00:50:44.275 --> 00:50:45.055]  They're in the system.
[00:50:46.983 --> 00:50:48.944]  Five times out of ten, you've lost them for life.
[00:50:48.964 --> 00:50:49.744]  A life of crime.
[00:50:49.764 --> 00:50:51.124]  They're gonna go to school to be criminals.
[00:50:51.144 --> 00:50:52.104]  That's what jail is.
[00:50:53.205 --> 00:50:55.125]  And good little children's lives are over.
[00:50:56.246 --> 00:50:59.466]  And that whore gets to get fatter and fatter.
[00:51:00.047 --> 00:51:06.128]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:06.468 --> 00:51:08.409]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:08.789 --> 00:51:16.391]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:17.122 --> 00:51:24.166]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:24.566 --> 00:51:35.992]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:36.312 --> 00:51:39.814]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:40.275 --> 00:51:42.196]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:42.536 --> 00:51:46.378]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:51:59.878 --> 00:52:05.102]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:52:05.242 --> 00:52:13.328]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:52:13.589 --> 00:52:20.634]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:52:20.834 --> 00:52:22.095]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[00:52:22.195 --> 00:52:28.078]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:52:28.278 --> 00:52:33.361]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:52:33.481 --> 00:52:42.346]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.

[00:53:55.577 --> 00:53:58.199]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[00:54:20.687 --> 00:54:28.835]  Okay, now I'm going to get the John Swinton New York Times editor's quote where he said we are prostitutes, we are intellectual prostitutes.
[00:54:28.855 --> 00:54:29.996]  That's what I mean by whore.
[00:54:30.536 --> 00:54:31.917]  She's a total demon.
[00:54:32.017 --> 00:54:36.822]  I mean, they got her in, I don't know, ten years ago or whatever, as county judge.
[00:54:38.083 --> 00:54:45.209]  And they have a giant, huge facility, and they keep expanding it, called the Jean Muir Juvenile Justice Center.
[00:54:45.970 --> 00:54:47.451]  And I mean, it's a factory.
[00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:50.761]  Because the court isn't even a real court.
[00:54:50.861 --> 00:54:56.183]  It just operates and adjudicates, and just threatens everyone, and screams at everyone.
[00:54:56.484 --> 00:55:02.686]  I mean, it's just a woman with a pack of demon judges, just like our former sheriff, who we finally ran out of here.
[00:55:02.706 --> 00:55:03.987]  The sheriff's department finally did.
[00:55:04.027 --> 00:55:06.468]  She puts only... You know what I'm talking about, sheriff.
[00:55:06.748 --> 00:55:08.409]  Sheriff's deputies, yeah, you're on our side.
[00:55:08.609 --> 00:55:09.629]  You know about the scum.
[00:55:10.089 --> 00:55:13.771]  And she only brings in her scum, and this is how they operate!
[00:55:14.682 --> 00:55:25.933]  And if you don't think ruining children's lives and threatening people into getting into the system, when it's not even crimes, isn't a crime, your head isn't screwed on right.
[00:55:26.053 --> 00:55:31.358]  In fact, I found the John Swinton quote here.
[00:55:31.398 --> 00:55:32.439]  Let me go ahead and read it to you.
[00:55:34.401 --> 00:55:35.963]  John Swinton on the independence of the press.
[00:55:37.541 --> 00:55:39.962]  This was made in the night of 1880.
[00:55:40.302 --> 00:55:44.702]  Swinton was the guest of honor at a banquet given him by the leaders of his craft.
[00:55:45.183 --> 00:55:59.285]  Someone who knew neither the press nor Swinton offered to toast to the independent press, Swinton, outraged his colleagues by replying, there is no such thing at this date of the world's history in America as an independent press.
[00:55:59.325 --> 00:56:00.586]  There is now though, isn't there?
[00:56:01.046 --> 00:56:02.226]  You know it and I know it.
[00:56:02.754 --> 00:56:06.076]  There is not one of you who dares to write your honest opinions.
[00:56:06.136 --> 00:56:09.659]  And if you did, you know beforehand it would never appear in print.
[00:56:10.119 --> 00:56:13.561]  I am paid weekly for keeping my honest opinion out of the paper.
[00:56:14.062 --> 00:56:14.842]  I am connected with.
[00:56:15.062 --> 00:56:18.124]  Others of you are paid similar salaries for similar things.
[00:56:18.184 --> 00:56:26.370]  And any of you who would be so foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job.
[00:56:26.974 --> 00:56:33.639]  If I allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my paper before 24 hours, my occupation would be gone.
[00:56:34.079 --> 00:56:45.286]  The business of journalists is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of mammon, and to sell his countrymen and his race for his daily bread.
[00:56:45.667 --> 00:56:46.767]  You know it and I know it.
[00:56:47.328 --> 00:56:50.470]  And what folly is this toasting in independent press?
[00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:55.213]  We are the tools and the vassals of rich men behind the scenes.
[00:56:55.573 --> 00:56:56.834]  We are the jumping jacks.
[00:56:57.374 --> 00:56:59.135]  They pull the strings and we dance.
[00:56:59.636 --> 00:57:04.059]  Our talents, our possibilities, and our lives are all the property of other men.
[00:57:04.399 --> 00:57:06.420]  We are intellectual prostitutes.
[00:57:08.301 --> 00:57:20.229]  And that is Labor's Untold Story by Richard O. Boyer and Herbert M. Moraes, published by United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers of America, 1955, New York.
[00:57:26.957 --> 00:57:29.239]  And I can't say it any better than that.
[00:57:30.801 --> 00:57:32.162]  But we aren't beholden.
[00:57:32.963 --> 00:57:33.984]  I own this company.
[00:57:34.624 --> 00:57:35.866]  I own my radio show.
[00:57:36.266 --> 00:57:37.407]  I own my websites.
[00:57:37.847 --> 00:57:44.574]  And I do my best to navigate the frauds that are out there and to wake you up and to get you moving.
[00:57:45.635 --> 00:57:47.997]  And this is what burns in my heart.
[00:57:48.037 --> 00:57:49.298]  This is what makes me tick.
[00:57:49.318 --> 00:57:50.900]  It's what rows my boat.
[00:57:51.741 --> 00:57:52.061]  Okay?
[00:57:52.925 --> 00:57:57.448]  Is that I know there are all these evil sociopathic people that get off on power.
[00:57:58.088 --> 00:58:07.694]  You got criminals in positions of power, psychopaths in positions of power, who get off on bullying people, and I don't know about you, but it makes me get mad.
[00:58:08.995 --> 00:58:10.056]  What's the thing say?
[00:58:10.796 --> 00:58:12.477]  It's clobberin' time!
[00:58:12.497 --> 00:58:12.557]  And...
[00:58:17.728 --> 00:58:18.529]  We can wake up.
[00:58:18.589 --> 00:58:20.190]  We can do what people have done throughout history.
[00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:23.612]  We can let the truth spread like a wildfire, like it is.
[00:58:25.033 --> 00:58:33.459]  And we can admit more and more of these people in prison, expose more and more of them, get more and more of them out of office, take more of these CEOs to jail.
[00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:37.062]  We can take this country back if you really want it enough!

[00:58:59.179 --> 00:59:00.319]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:00.339 --> 00:59:01.760]  You want answers?
[00:59:02.521 --> 00:59:03.502]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.082 --> 00:59:08.065]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:08.265 --> 00:59:12.408]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:19.233 --> 00:59:22.896]  Yesterday, December 7th,
[00:59:25.661 --> 00:59:32.047]  1941, a date which will live in infamy.
[00:59:33.788 --> 00:59:44.558]  The United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.
[00:59:46.039 --> 00:59:49.222]  The United States was at peace with that nation,
[00:59:51.159 --> 01:00:06.050]  And at the solicitation of Japan, was still in conversation with its government and its emperor, looking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific.
[01:00:07.832 --> 01:00:18.460]  Indeed, one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing in the American island of Oahu,
[01:00:19.972 --> 01:00:35.439]  The Japanese ambassador to the United States and his colleague delivered to our Secretary of State a formal reply to a recent American message.
[01:00:36.119 --> 01:00:45.023]  Japan has therefore undertaken a surprise offensive extending throughout the Pacific area.
[01:00:46.464 --> 01:00:47.064]  The facts
[01:00:48.209 --> 01:00:52.930]  of yesterday and today speak for themselves.
[01:00:54.631 --> 01:01:10.235]  With confidence in our armed forces, with the unbounding determination of our people, we will gain the inevitable triumph, so help us God!
[01:01:13.792 --> 01:01:15.334]  But that really wasn't the case.
[01:01:15.574 --> 01:01:28.606]  There were already mercenary forces flying different aircraft against the Japanese in the aid of the Chinese at that time.
[01:01:29.407 --> 01:01:36.634]  Oil supplies had been cut off to China, and there had been open discussions about war with Japan.
[01:01:38.883 --> 01:01:50.288]  Within three weeks of the attack, the codes had been broken years before, the purple and the blue, but the naval purple, and they knew the exact date of the attack.
[01:01:50.328 --> 01:02:04.213]  The Honolulu Advertiser, the major newspaper in Hawaii at the time, is still there today, ran the headline a week before that there would be an attack on December 7th.
[01:02:04.293 --> 01:02:06.994]  I have a copy of that newspaper report.
[01:02:07.214 --> 01:02:08.555]  That's how much people knew.
[01:02:09.668 --> 01:02:12.649]  But Admiral Kimmel and others were ordered to tie the ships together.
[01:02:12.689 --> 01:02:15.070]  They were ordered to point the planes in towards each other.
[01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:17.131]  They were ordered to put everyone on leave.
[01:02:18.271 --> 01:02:24.754]  Five midget submarines, excuse me, four midget submarines attacked that morning.
[01:02:24.774 --> 01:02:27.955]  They did not coordinate their attack properly and arrived one hour early.
[01:02:28.715 --> 01:02:30.336]  Destroyers took out three of them.
[01:02:31.016 --> 01:02:32.397]  One of them crashed on the rocks.
[01:02:33.597 --> 01:02:37.158]  It was even reported on the local radio, but everyone was ordered to stand down.
[01:02:37.178 --> 01:02:37.658]  You imagine?
[01:02:37.999 --> 01:02:38.939]  Subs are attacking.
[01:02:40.054 --> 01:02:43.636]  Destroyers are out in the mouth of the harbor, sinking subs.
[01:02:44.697 --> 01:02:50.861]  One of them is out at the Pacific War Museum in Fredericksburg, Texas.
[01:02:51.681 --> 01:02:55.523]  I knew about that, because I'd been there, before it was ever in CNN in 2002.
[01:02:57.585 --> 01:02:58.445]  Headline, U.S.
[01:02:58.505 --> 01:02:59.266]  attack Japan.
[01:02:59.826 --> 01:03:00.286]  CNN.
[01:03:00.586 --> 01:03:02.668]  Because they actually opened fire on the subs first.
[01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:08.151]  The stand-down wasn't complete, was it?
[01:03:08.823 --> 01:03:09.944]  That's red-handed.
[01:03:10.784 --> 01:03:12.405]  But see, this is provocateur-ed, though.
[01:03:12.705 --> 01:03:13.666]  We know they're going to attack.
[01:03:13.986 --> 01:03:14.786]  We open the door.
[01:03:14.866 --> 01:03:15.727]  We block everybody.
[01:03:15.987 --> 01:03:18.788]  The Japanese pull their embassy staff out two days before the attacks.
[01:03:19.009 --> 01:03:20.049]  They leave Washington.
[01:03:20.709 --> 01:03:23.731]  Totally obvious they have the attack date.
[01:03:27.453 --> 01:03:27.893]  Amazing.
[01:03:28.334 --> 01:03:33.216]  We've got Tom Kimmel, the grandson of Admiral Kimmel, joining us.
[01:03:34.617 --> 01:03:36.358]  Then we've got Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[01:03:37.395 --> 01:03:40.821]  It was Newbrook, the Constitution in Exile, in the third hour.
[01:03:41.723 --> 01:03:42.464]  Big broadcast.
[01:03:42.484 --> 01:03:42.965]  Stay with us.
[01:03:54.756 --> 01:03:55.216]  It's here!
[01:03:55.436 --> 01:04:00.218]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:00.578 --> 01:04:08.240]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:15.963]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:16.363 --> 01:04:23.265]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spies,
[01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:27.802]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:28.082 --> 01:04:31.583]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:32.063 --> 01:04:33.724]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:34.324 --> 01:04:38.246]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:52.372 --> 01:04:53.352]  Good morning, honey.
[01:04:53.692 --> 01:04:59.694]  Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation!
[01:04:59.994 --> 01:05:00.574]  Yeah.
[01:05:00.974 --> 01:05:02.394]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[01:05:02.755 --> 01:05:06.155]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel berkey system.
[01:05:06.616 --> 01:05:08.096]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[01:05:08.556 --> 01:05:10.256]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[01:05:10.657 --> 01:05:12.397]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[01:05:12.617 --> 01:05:13.558]  Honey, cheer up!
[01:05:13.899 --> 01:05:16.161]  I brought our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[01:05:16.422 --> 01:05:16.742]  What?
[01:05:17.163 --> 01:05:27.655]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[01:05:27.935 --> 01:05:28.196]  You know?
[01:05:28.636 --> 01:05:30.098]  This is a terrific cabin!
[01:05:30.318 --> 01:05:31.139]  And, wow!
[01:05:31.359 --> 01:05:32.801]  Have you noticed the beautiful weather?
[01:05:33.101 --> 01:05:34.282]  Don't ruin your vacation.

[01:05:38.507 --> 01:05:39.868]  Travel Berkey not available in Iowa.
[01:05:51.258 --> 01:05:54.842]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[01:05:55.122 --> 01:05:55.963]  Look no further!
[01:05:56.263 --> 01:05:58.846]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.

[01:06:08.575 --> 01:06:08.895]  I think so.
[01:06:25.538 --> 01:06:25.798]  I'm good.
[01:06:51.511 --> 01:06:56.555]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:56.915 --> 01:06:59.237]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:06:59.257 --> 01:07:07.103]  Well, we're really honored to have Tom Kimmel on with us.
[01:07:07.163 --> 01:07:09.365]  I've also interviewed his father, if memory serves.
[01:07:10.006 --> 01:07:16.711]  Many years ago, he is the grandson of Admiral Kimmel.
[01:07:17.412 --> 01:07:18.755]  Let me just go over his bio.
[01:07:18.775 --> 01:07:19.898]  He's on vacation.
[01:07:20.559 --> 01:07:22.383]  He timed this so he would...
[01:07:23.317 --> 01:07:25.498]  Be able to be in port as a sailor.
[01:07:25.558 --> 01:07:26.578]  Once a sailor, always a sailor.
[01:07:26.598 --> 01:07:28.759]  He's on a cruise out in Hawaii right now.
[01:07:28.779 --> 01:07:29.480]  I wish I was there.
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:30.000]  I'm envious.
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:38.003]  Tom Kimmel, a noted Pearl Harbor scholar, former FBI agent, and the eldest grandson of Admiral Husband E. Kimmel.
[01:07:38.063 --> 01:07:52.169]  Tom Kimmel comes from a long line of distinguished scholars and servants to the United States government and from a family that has dedicated itself and given generously to protecting the freedom and way of life that the 9-11 attacks threaten.
[01:07:53.098 --> 01:07:53.919]  This is his bio.
[01:07:54.459 --> 01:07:56.241]  A 1966 graduate of the U.S.
[01:07:56.281 --> 01:07:58.683]  Naval Academy and Lieutenant Commander in the U.S.
[01:07:58.763 --> 01:08:04.407]  Naval Reserve, Tom went on to serve his country as an agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation for more than 25 years.
[01:08:04.467 --> 01:08:18.118]  Tom, the eldest grandson of Admiral Kimmel, the Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor when the Japanese attacked on December 7, 1941, is the sixth member of the family to graduate from the Naval Academy and the ninth to graduate from a service academy.
[01:08:18.158 --> 01:08:18.759]  In fact, Tom
[01:08:19.159 --> 01:08:27.465]  It's a great-grandfather, Admiral Kimmel's father, an 1857 West Point graduate, fought for both the North and the South in the Civil War.
[01:08:27.565 --> 01:08:34.029]  And it just goes on and on, his FBI service and the books he's been involved with and all the things he's done.
[01:08:34.330 --> 01:08:37.292]  And we have links over to websites and places where you can learn more.
[01:08:37.832 --> 01:08:43.436]  And we're honored to have him on, on this anniversary here today.
[01:08:43.456 --> 01:08:45.558]  What is it, the 65th anniversary?
[01:08:46.178 --> 01:08:47.459]  Thank you for coming on, Mr. Kimmel.
[01:08:48.633 --> 01:08:49.473]  Alex, my pleasure.
[01:08:49.513 --> 01:08:50.393]  Thanks for the opportunity.
[01:08:50.893 --> 01:08:52.094]  Now, I was public school educated.
[01:08:52.134 --> 01:08:52.974]  I'm just now doing the math.
[01:08:53.014 --> 01:08:54.014]  What anniversary is this?
[01:08:54.874 --> 01:08:55.534]  Sixty-fifth.
[01:08:55.694 --> 01:08:56.055]  That's right.
[01:08:56.095 --> 01:08:56.715]  Sixty-fifth.
[01:08:59.195 --> 01:09:09.657]  Let's go over from the beginning, the whole story if we can, why you've gone public, why your father went public for his father, and what the facts are, because we've got this dead to rights.
[01:09:10.017 --> 01:09:10.678]  What really happened?
[01:09:10.698 --> 01:09:12.498]  Maybe the antagonism against Japan,
[01:09:13.338 --> 01:09:31.853]  The military operations covertly against them in China, the midget subs that morning, a lot of stuff's come out and you've got new developments that have just come out in the last few months for us here today and you really are the world expert, and plus you've got an investigation background and a naval background, so I can't think of someone better to vet the facts for us.
[01:09:33.855 --> 01:09:39.019]  Yeah, I should start with the famous rock commission days after the Pearl Harbor attacks.
[01:09:39.079 --> 01:09:39.760]  Am I stuck there?
[01:09:40.584 --> 01:09:41.064]  Absolutely.
[01:09:41.125 --> 01:09:43.806]  Murphy's Law, your cell phone sounded great until just a moment ago.
[01:09:43.847 --> 01:09:44.627]  Why don't you start over?
[01:09:45.788 --> 01:09:46.108]  Okay.
[01:09:46.168 --> 01:09:54.474]  Well, I'm going to try and relay starting at nine days after the Pearl Harbor attack with the formation of the Roberts Commission.
[01:09:54.835 --> 01:09:55.675]  Can you hear me okay?
[01:09:56.276 --> 01:09:56.976]  You're coming through.
[01:09:57.036 --> 01:09:57.757]  Roger, roger.
[01:09:58.877 --> 01:09:59.278]  Okay.
[01:09:59.318 --> 01:10:00.499]  Let's start this way.
[01:10:00.979 --> 01:10:07.564]  Nine days after the Pearl Harbor attack, and if you want to compare this with any 9-11 analogies, please feel free to do so.
[01:10:08.132 --> 01:10:21.738]  Nine days after the Pearl Harbor attack, the President of the United States selected a sitting Supreme Court Associate Justice, Owen Roberts, to investigate the Army and the Navy only in Hawaii.
[01:10:23.278 --> 01:10:26.399]  That was the charter that Chairman Roberts was given.
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:31.862]  Ten days after the Pearl Harbor attack, my grandfather and generals were placed.
[01:10:33.683 --> 01:10:49.887]  11 days after the Pearl Harbor attack, the Robert Commission investigated for a grand total of 36 days, after which they wrote a report, unredacted, signed by the President of the United States and sent around the world without showing to Admiral Kimmel.
[01:10:50.767 --> 01:10:56.309]  Finding Admiral Kimmel was a totally blatant success of the company.
[01:10:56.549 --> 01:11:01.930]  Unfortunately, sir, unfortunately, hold on just a second, Mr. Kimmel, have you moved from the spot you were previously?
[01:11:02.951 --> 01:11:04.452]  I was at the same spot.
[01:11:04.592 --> 01:11:06.833]  I'm sorry, but this might be a problem.
[01:11:07.013 --> 01:11:07.613]  How about now?
[01:11:09.354 --> 01:11:15.097]  Yeah, wherever you... Maybe if you get towards the outside of the ship, the microwaves can get to your cell phone.
[01:11:16.938 --> 01:11:17.358]  Okay.
[01:11:17.598 --> 01:11:18.639]  I'm not coming through.
[01:11:18.659 --> 01:11:19.599]  Is that the problem?
[01:11:19.639 --> 01:11:23.021]  Well, it's choppy.
[01:11:24.301 --> 01:11:26.262]  Can you get towards the outside of the ship?
[01:11:26.282 --> 01:11:29.524]  Can you go out maybe on a balcony or go out on a deck?
[01:11:30.532 --> 01:11:31.572]  Well, I'm trying right now.
[01:11:31.612 --> 01:11:32.352]  How's that sound?
[01:11:32.512 --> 01:11:33.213]  It sounds good.
[01:11:33.653 --> 01:11:34.493]  You're loud and clear now.
[01:11:35.353 --> 01:11:35.633]  Okay.
[01:11:35.673 --> 01:11:37.293]  You want me to start over, or did you get any of it?
[01:11:38.914 --> 01:11:39.494]  Start over, sir.
[01:11:39.534 --> 01:11:40.054]  I apologize.
[01:11:40.094 --> 01:11:40.374]  Go ahead.
[01:11:41.294 --> 01:11:41.734]  Okay.
[01:11:42.695 --> 01:11:58.878]  A good place to start an understanding of the Pearl Harbor attack is nine days after the Pearl Harbor attack, when President Roosevelt appointed a sitting Supreme Court Associate Justice, Owen Roberts, to investigate the Army and the Navy only at Hawaii.
[01:11:59.969 --> 01:12:05.772]  Ten days after the Pearl Harbor attack, my grandfather and General Short were fired and replaced.
[01:12:06.632 --> 01:12:12.495]  Eleven days after the Pearl Harbor attack, Justice Roberts began his investigation.
[01:12:12.595 --> 01:12:28.583]  They investigated for a grand total of 36 days, after which they wrote a report, unredacted, signed by the President of the United States, not shown to Admiral Kimmel, sent around the world, accusing Admiral Kimmel and General Short
[01:12:29.281 --> 01:12:35.103]  of being derelict in their duty and solely blamable for the success of the Japanese attack.
[01:12:35.663 --> 01:12:37.443]  So that's where the matter stood, Alex.
[01:12:37.903 --> 01:12:40.084]  47 days after the Pearl Harbor attack.
[01:12:40.164 --> 01:12:42.104]  Soup to nuts end of the story.
[01:12:42.805 --> 01:12:45.905]  And that's the way the matter stood for years.
[01:12:46.145 --> 01:12:55.508]  No judge, no jury, just summary, whitewash, saying the government's blameless and hanging two patriots out to dry.
[01:12:56.468 --> 01:13:01.343]  Well, not only no judge jury, we're not even going to show you the results.
[01:13:02.225 --> 01:13:29.026]  We're just going to broadcast the results, and that's what they did, and it hung that way for years, for years, Alex, until specifically February 21st, 1944, at which time the father of naval communications intelligence, Captain Lawrence Safford, the revered father of naval communications intelligence, illegally, and at great personal risk to himself, went to see my grandfather in the Bronx, New York.
[01:13:29.858 --> 01:13:40.364]  And ask my grandfather, did you have available to you, Admiral Kimmel, prior to the Pearl Harbor attack, the information that we had available to us in Washington, D.C.
[01:13:40.424 --> 01:13:45.708]  from the secret decoding of Japanese diplomatic and spy communications.
[01:13:45.828 --> 01:13:47.789]  Very important, the spy communications.
[01:13:48.510 --> 01:14:07.583]  In a program that we codenamed MAGIC, which gave us, prior to the attack in Washington, D.C., gave us indications of the time of the Pearl Harbor attack, the place of the Pearl Harbor attack, the reason for the Pearl Harbor attack, and very importantly, the deceit plan to cover the Pearl Harbor attack.
[01:14:07.943 --> 01:14:11.566]  Again, Admiral Kimmel, all of this under a program that we codenamed MAGIC.
[01:14:12.339 --> 01:14:23.224]  Admiral Kimmel, who at the time was a beaten, despondent man, perfectly capable of suicide, he looked to Captain Safford and said, Captain Safford, what in the world are you talking about?
[01:14:23.544 --> 01:14:24.744]  What is magic?
[01:14:25.665 --> 01:14:35.229]  Captain Safford explained, my grandfather that very day went from a beaten, despondent man, perfectly capable of suicide, he turned into a fighting tiger.
[01:14:35.849 --> 01:14:37.810]  He got himself a Boston law firm.
[01:14:39.444 --> 01:14:47.890]  A marvelous lawyer from that firm by the name of Ed Hannafy actually wrote the enabling legislation that he took to the Naval Affairs Committee.
[01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:49.411]  Dewey Short was the chairman.
[01:14:49.932 --> 01:15:06.282]  Dewey Short was so impressed with what he saw, he got Congress to pass a law ordering the Army and the Navy to conduct further investigations, Alex, or there would have been no further investigation of Pearl Harbor 47 days after the Pearl Harbor attack.
[01:15:06.382 --> 01:15:12.406]  So good people inside the system, he first went and found out, did you have this information?
[01:15:12.466 --> 01:15:13.706]  Because then he would be culpable.
[01:15:13.987 --> 01:15:14.687]  No, he didn't.
[01:15:14.727 --> 01:15:16.168]  He was not culpable.
[01:15:17.051 --> 01:15:21.693]  Well, there were eight subsequent investigations, official investigations, subsequent to the Roberts Commission.
[01:15:21.913 --> 01:15:22.413]  All eight!
[01:15:22.633 --> 01:15:34.198]  All eight of those investigations, Alex, were caused directly to happen as a result of the efforts of Admiral Kimmel, or in the case of the very last one in 1995, by Admiral Kimmel's family.
[01:15:35.819 --> 01:15:40.741]  And of course, the most important one, at least from our standpoint, the only one of the ten
[01:15:41.576 --> 01:16:05.838]  Official investigations, the ten tribunals, if you will, the only one of those that accorded Admiral Kimmel the opportunity to defend himself, in other words, the opportunity to call and cross-examine witnesses, the only one of those ten tribunals was the Naval Court of Inquiry, which, by the very basis of the way it was conducted, you would think would be given more weight under any kind of American system of jurisprudence.
[01:16:06.664 --> 01:16:09.025]  What was the findings of the Naval Court of Inquiry?
[01:16:09.105 --> 01:16:12.406]  It's absolutely key to my even being here.
[01:16:12.506 --> 01:16:15.747]  I wouldn't be on this program but for the Naval Court of Inquiry.
[01:16:16.328 --> 01:16:16.788]  Three.
[01:16:16.808 --> 01:16:24.151]  High-ranking admirals, all with great experience and high command at sea, terribly important.
[01:16:25.291 --> 01:16:26.852]  They made the following findings.
[01:16:27.092 --> 01:16:33.074]  Number one, that there was not a scintilla of evidence to support a charge of dereliction of duty against Admiral Kimmel.
[01:16:34.421 --> 01:16:43.455]  In fact, the dereliction of duty was Roosevelt and the scallywags in the State Department who purposefully blocked any of that information getting to combat forces.
[01:16:44.787 --> 01:16:49.050]  Well, of course, the dereliction of duty charge was only made by the Roberts Commission.
[01:16:49.110 --> 01:16:54.513]  No one else has made the dereliction of duty charge in any of the other nine investigations.
[01:16:54.873 --> 01:16:57.735]  But clearly, they're the traitors blocking that information.
[01:16:57.755 --> 01:17:06.361]  I mean, even the Honolulu Advertiser a week before, I know you've got a copy, said we'll be attacked on December 8th because it's a day different over there.
[01:17:06.381 --> 01:17:08.682]  Really, December 7th, it was the right day U.S.
[01:17:08.722 --> 01:17:08.982]  time.
[01:17:09.202 --> 01:17:09.923]  Is that not correct?
[01:17:10.785 --> 01:17:13.306]  Well, that's a great story, Alex, and I'm glad you bring that up.
[01:17:13.366 --> 01:17:15.066]  Very few people even know about that.
[01:17:15.466 --> 01:17:26.348]  The way that story unfolded, they went through all of the investigations, and of course that was a fact, that the Honolulu Advertiser did say that Pearl Harbor was attacked by Japan over the weekend.
[01:17:26.688 --> 01:17:29.609]  And the question was, how in the world did that story get in the paper?
[01:17:30.029 --> 01:17:40.231]  Well, we didn't find out about that until sometime in the 1980s, when Joseph Lieb came forward and said he put that story on the
[01:17:41.401 --> 01:17:43.542]  Uh, Associated Press Wire.
[01:17:44.703 --> 01:17:46.523]  And he gives his full story.
[01:17:46.563 --> 01:17:51.786]  He gave it in Hustler Magazine, of all the terrible places to give it, but nonetheless, that's what the story was.
[01:17:52.266 --> 01:17:53.967]  We actually interviewed Joseph Lee.
[01:17:54.147 --> 01:17:55.827]  Seemed like a credible person to us.
[01:17:56.468 --> 01:18:03.811]  Uh, he said he got the story from his good friend, the Secretary of State, Cordell Hall, who was in a tizzy prior to Pearl Harbor.
[01:18:04.472 --> 01:18:11.237]  Because he was restrained from providing more information than he was allowed to.
[01:18:11.257 --> 01:18:16.080]  Well, the credibility of the story is it picked the date.
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:23.525]  It said over the weekend on the 8th, which according to that time, the way they had dating then, that would be actually the 7th here.
[01:18:25.054 --> 01:18:35.101]  Well, that's true, and it was there, and of course, Joseph Lieb is the one who indicated that he's pre-put the news story on the wire, and the only one who picked it up was a Honolulu advertiser.
[01:18:35.341 --> 01:18:37.463]  Now, now, now, I don't even know what the new developments are.
[01:18:37.483 --> 01:18:40.065]  We were talking during the last break, and you said you've got new developments.
[01:18:40.365 --> 01:18:41.626]  Let's talk about that when we get back.
[01:18:41.666 --> 01:18:43.507]  Let's talk about the midget subs.
[01:18:44.288 --> 01:18:51.353]  Let's talk about how they were provocateur into attacking us, the stand-down, everything, with the grandson of the head of the Pacific League.
[01:18:51.873 --> 01:18:58.100]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:18:58.561 --> 01:19:06.310]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:19:06.670 --> 01:19:14.538]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:19:14.839 --> 01:19:19.604]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:19:19.944 --> 01:19:24.569]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:19:25.129 --> 01:19:28.991]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of International Banking Cartel.
[01:19:29.491 --> 01:19:30.511]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:19:30.571 --> 01:19:34.653]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[01:19:48.401 --> 01:19:56.368]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[01:19:56.548 --> 01:19:58.630]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[01:19:58.870 --> 01:20:05.896]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:20:06.096 --> 01:20:17.645]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[01:20:18.025 --> 01:20:25.391]  Its multi-voltage capabilities, multiple adapters, and rechargeable batteries provide for flexible source of auxiliary backup power.
[01:20:25.691 --> 01:20:30.675]  Simply place the Berkey Solar Charger in the sun, plug in your application, and you have power.
[01:20:30.815 --> 01:20:35.799]  Disconnect your application and the system automatically begins charging its own rechargeable batteries.

[01:20:49.923 --> 01:21:02.266]  One of America's greatest patriots, Patrick Henry, said, give me liberty or give me death.
[01:21:03.263 --> 01:21:07.365]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution.
[01:21:07.805 --> 01:21:16.510]  Your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.
[01:21:17.290 --> 01:21:22.613]  There are certain movements underway to strip you of these unalienable, unchangeable rights today.
[01:21:22.633 --> 01:21:30.737]  To help you grasp the loss of these freedoms, we'll send you absolutely free a one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:31.517 --> 01:21:32.078]  Just call 1-800
[01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:33.700]  516-8736.
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:34.381]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:21:34.421 --> 01:21:35.703]  It's absolutely free.
[01:21:35.723 --> 01:21:38.166]  Operators are standing by to assist you.
[01:21:38.207 --> 01:21:38.787]  Just call right now.
[01:21:50.982 --> 01:21:51.562]  It's a fact.
[01:21:51.762 --> 01:21:56.205]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:21:56.525 --> 01:22:01.727]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[01:22:02.007 --> 01:22:05.229]  So why should you, the hard-working American, be harassed for yours?
[01:22:05.469 --> 01:22:12.612]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[01:22:12.953 --> 01:22:20.116]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[01:22:20.376 --> 01:22:22.478]  This is not a debt consolidation company.
[01:22:22.878 --> 01:22:29.202]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt.
[01:22:29.442 --> 01:22:33.245]  Instead of living each day in fear, it's time to turn your life around.
[01:22:33.565 --> 01:22:36.147]  Call Day of Jubilee open 9 a.m.
[01:22:36.207 --> 01:22:37.027]  to 5 p.m.
[01:22:37.067 --> 01:22:38.488]  Central Standard Time at 920-293-8024.
[01:22:38.628 --> 01:22:40.069]  That's 920-293-8024 and ask for Robert.
[01:22:40.109 --> 01:22:43.091]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[01:22:53.339 --> 01:22:57.182]  We're good to go.
[01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:12.440]  Retired FBI agent.
[01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:13.581]  25 years there.
[01:23:13.601 --> 01:23:15.541]  Distinguished career in the Navy.
[01:23:15.601 --> 01:23:16.441]  Graduate of the U.S.
[01:23:16.481 --> 01:23:17.101]  Naval Academy.
[01:23:19.082 --> 01:23:23.343]  You have to say he's in the top ten of the famous American naval families.
[01:23:23.483 --> 01:23:28.244]  Two top admirals in the family that I know of.
[01:23:28.304 --> 01:23:29.564]  I'm sure there's a lot more.
[01:23:30.384 --> 01:23:35.125]  But the head of the Pacific Fleet was his grandfather, who then found out that he was set up
[01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:40.583]  And now, 65 years later, we know everything that happened.
[01:23:41.164 --> 01:23:47.348]  It's clear as the nose on anybody's face how this was all set up, how the Japanese were provocative.
[01:23:47.388 --> 01:23:48.349]  I'm not defending them either.
[01:23:48.369 --> 01:23:49.990]  Very bloodthirsty government.
[01:23:50.030 --> 01:23:50.951]  Very evil emperor.
[01:23:51.091 --> 01:23:52.452]  Medical experiments on our people.
[01:23:52.732 --> 01:23:55.394]  Who, by the way, they then gave us all the secrets.
[01:23:56.074 --> 01:23:57.195]  They let them all go free.
[01:23:57.835 --> 01:23:58.696]  Just so sick.
[01:23:59.624 --> 01:24:01.246]  So I'm not here defending the Japanese either.
[01:24:01.266 --> 01:24:02.607]  The point is they were totally set up.
[01:24:03.008 --> 01:24:04.009]  And we know that for a fact.
[01:24:04.549 --> 01:24:06.411]  But you said something coming into the interview.
[01:24:06.431 --> 01:24:07.152]  This is a short segment.
[01:24:07.172 --> 01:24:11.637]  Why don't we just cover this now and get into the new developments in the next segment, Mr. Kimmel.
[01:24:13.190 --> 01:24:17.733]  You said make any connections or any illusions of 9-11 you'd like.
[01:24:18.194 --> 01:24:20.916]  We know the NSA got the interceptionists told to stand down.
[01:24:20.936 --> 01:24:23.097]  We know FBI agents were told to stand down.
[01:24:23.117 --> 01:24:25.259]  When they went public afterwards, they were threatened with arrest.
[01:24:25.299 --> 01:24:27.220]  I've interviewed them right here on the air.
[01:24:27.921 --> 01:24:32.264]  We know that supposed hijackers trained at US military bases in covert spy training.
[01:24:32.544 --> 01:24:33.585]  That's Associated Press.
[01:24:34.445 --> 01:24:38.547]  Well, what I'm trying to do, Alex, is to elevate the effort to advance Admiral Kimmel on the retired list
[01:25:03.335 --> 01:25:17.424]  To something of a higher plane, a higher calling, and that is to attempt to learn lessons that the Pearl Harbor survivors have been trying to teach us for 65 years in order to avoid a second Pearl Harbor, if you will.
[01:25:18.685 --> 01:25:25.889]  And there are many things that we are doing and have done that make it clear we have not paid attention to those lessons.
[01:25:27.030 --> 01:25:28.170]  Let me give you an example.
[01:25:28.370 --> 01:25:28.851]  There have been 10
[01:25:29.907 --> 01:25:31.890]  Official Pearl Harbor investigations.
[01:25:32.610 --> 01:25:37.877]  Of course, as I was trying to say earlier, only one of them accorded Admiral Kimball an opportunity to defend himself.
[01:25:38.398 --> 01:25:43.384]  Let me ask you this, have you got any idea how many official investigations there have been of 9-11?
[01:25:43.684 --> 01:25:49.151]  There have been... There's been one congressional whitewash and then one whitewash appointed by Bush.
[01:25:50.316 --> 01:25:54.700]  Well, that's what most people think, but the truth is there's been at least nine investigations.
[01:25:55.340 --> 01:26:01.726]  And maybe the most significant one was the Central Intelligence Agency's Inspector General's investigation.
[01:26:01.906 --> 01:26:02.146]  Yes.
[01:26:02.467 --> 01:26:03.528]  And that thing is still secret.
[01:26:03.548 --> 01:26:07.611]  There's been FEMA, there's been NIST, there's been Pentagon, yeah.
[01:26:07.691 --> 01:26:08.572]  It's still secret.
[01:26:08.912 --> 01:26:10.333]  That's the amazing thing about it.
[01:26:10.934 --> 01:26:14.197]  That thing was prepared before the last election.
[01:26:14.736 --> 01:26:18.779]  And yet, it was not allowed to see the light of day in any form.
[01:26:18.939 --> 01:26:28.506]  And the problem is, you've got a lot of people in the CIA who aren't traitors, who aren't part of the attack, and so they're going to tell the truth about what their findings are, so they've got to keep that secret.
[01:26:29.567 --> 01:26:30.988]  Well, the fact is, it's secret.
[01:26:31.288 --> 01:26:34.571]  Now, they did that for a while, the Pearl Harbor investigations, when the Army
[01:26:35.310 --> 01:26:41.953]  The Pearl Harbor Board came forward with their severe criticism of the head of the Army, General Marshall.
[01:26:43.253 --> 01:26:53.577]  The first thing that the administration did was to slap a secrecy on keeping it from the public for well over a year, actually until the war ended.
[01:26:53.617 --> 01:26:56.378]  It wasn't until the war ended that that thing was released.
[01:26:57.338 --> 01:26:59.419]  They did the same thing with the Naval Court of Inquiry.
[01:26:59.499 --> 01:27:00.400]  That wasn't released.
[01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:01.440]  That was for a year.
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:03.661]  We now have this
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:13.850]  Remarkable situation where the CIA IG report, which is as far as I know the only report that actually finds somebody responsible for the attack.
[01:27:13.950 --> 01:27:16.013]  Well let's boil this down to layman's terms.
[01:27:16.053 --> 01:27:19.757]  He was a former naval officer and an FBI agent and then working on this case.
[01:27:20.017 --> 01:27:22.239]  We got a cover-up of what really happened on Pearl Harbor.
[01:27:22.279 --> 01:27:23.000]  Now we know the truth.
[01:27:23.321 --> 01:27:24.922]  Are you saying there's a clear cover-up on 9-11?
[01:27:26.263 --> 01:27:41.395]  Well, I'm saying that we clearly have a very important investigation that we are quite certain names, names, casts, blame, pinpoints, responsibility, and that report is from the Inspector General of CIA.
[01:27:41.815 --> 01:27:47.880]  It was available before the last national election, and it's still completely unclassified.
[01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:49.401]  It's not been revealed.
[01:27:49.841 --> 01:27:51.342]  So it is being covered?
[01:27:51.522 --> 01:27:52.263]  Is that a cover-up?
[01:27:53.098 --> 01:27:56.443]  Well, what's the definition of cover-up?
[01:27:56.844 --> 01:28:00.890]  You have information which is clearly relevant and pertinent, and you're not making it public.
[01:28:01.250 --> 01:28:04.234]  Is that a cover-up?
[01:28:04.715 --> 01:28:06.538]  You're the former FBI guy, what do you say?
[01:28:07.395 --> 01:28:09.696]  Well, I say that there's information available.
[01:28:09.776 --> 01:28:13.718]  Now, a cover-up would be more on the order of the Pearl Harbor analogy.
[01:28:14.319 --> 01:28:15.620]  Let's go back to that model.
[01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:18.181]  We've got a break again, sir.
[01:28:18.481 --> 01:28:19.882]  Long segment, plenty of time.
[01:28:19.902 --> 01:28:23.824]  And let's break that down on the other side of this break.
[01:28:23.864 --> 01:28:25.365]  And yes, clearly there's a cover-up.
[01:28:25.385 --> 01:28:29.407]  You're ordering FBI agents under threat of arrest to shut up about what they know.
[01:28:30.087 --> 01:28:30.948]  Is that a cover-up?
[01:28:31.368 --> 01:28:32.829]  We'll get his answer on the other side.
[01:28:42.213 --> 01:28:45.197]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.138 --> 01:28:48.821]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:52.330 --> 01:28:56.311]  I found this company online and they have this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[01:28:56.531 --> 01:29:00.073]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[01:29:00.353 --> 01:29:04.434]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[01:29:04.714 --> 01:29:05.674]  I was so amazed.
[01:29:05.894 --> 01:29:08.735]  I put it in the baby's room and it made a perfect nightlight.
[01:29:08.935 --> 01:29:10.816]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[01:29:11.196 --> 01:29:16.398]  Saltlywellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[01:29:16.878 --> 01:29:22.781]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan salt.
[01:29:23.041 --> 01:29:24.782]  I figured it would clean really well.
[01:29:25.022 --> 01:29:28.224]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[01:29:28.404 --> 01:29:32.306]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[01:29:32.566 --> 01:29:34.067]  Plus, the service was great.
[01:29:34.387 --> 01:29:39.050]  If you're interested in natural homeopathic time-tested remedies, visit soleilwellness.com.
[01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:43.335]  That's SOLAYWellness.com or call 312-224-2710.
[01:29:43.355 --> 01:29:43.395]  312-224-2710.
[01:29:51.997 --> 01:29:53.837]  Dad, can we stop?
[01:29:54.177 --> 01:29:55.698]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[01:29:56.118 --> 01:29:56.358]  What?
[01:29:56.718 --> 01:29:57.078]  Again?
[01:29:57.498 --> 01:29:59.119]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[01:29:59.199 --> 01:30:03.619]  Honey, let's stop because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:05.140]  Why did you do that?
[01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:11.141]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[01:30:11.441 --> 01:30:12.461]  Are we there yet?
[01:30:12.581 --> 01:30:13.642]  for the entire trip.
[01:30:13.882 --> 01:30:16.102]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[01:30:16.562 --> 01:30:17.562]  Great idea.
[01:30:17.582 --> 01:30:20.423]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[01:30:20.805 --> 01:30:23.290]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[01:30:23.490 --> 01:30:27.879]  And using our Berkey Sport Bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[01:30:28.159 --> 01:30:28.480]  Honey!
[01:30:29.284 --> 01:30:30.525]  You're terrific!
[01:30:30.925 --> 01:30:32.406]  Oh, honey, so are you!
[01:30:32.526 --> 01:30:35.928]  You're the one that bought the family our Sport Berkey Water Bottles!
[01:30:36.209 --> 01:30:37.009]  Now, can we stop?
[01:30:37.510 --> 01:30:38.230]  I need to go, too.
[01:30:38.530 --> 01:30:42.993]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:43.013 --> 01:30:44.954]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:30:59.264 --> 01:30:59.644]  We're good to go.
[01:31:20.700 --> 01:31:21.280]  We're good to go.
[01:31:46.136 --> 01:32:10.630]  Tom Kimmel, retired naval officer, FBI agent, grandson of the Pacific Fleet Commander, Admiral Husband Kimmel, joins us today.
[01:32:10.670 --> 01:32:11.791]  We're very honored to have him.
[01:32:13.362 --> 01:32:15.623]  We'll tell you about any books or publications he recommends in a moment.
[01:32:16.563 --> 01:32:22.224]  We guarantee that you'll get your videos, your books, anything you get from the video and bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[01:32:22.665 --> 01:32:38.429]  If you order by the 15th, and that now is only 5, 6, 7, 8 days away, if we get your order in by the end of the 15th, and if it comes in on the 16th you'll probably get it, 17th, whatever, but we're trying to just, you know, cut it off there.
[01:32:39.614 --> 01:32:40.634]  Uh, for your Christmas gifts.
[01:32:40.674 --> 01:32:42.255]  That way you'll get it a few days before Christmas.
[01:32:42.635 --> 01:32:43.936]  You can also have us drop ship.
[01:32:43.976 --> 01:32:45.656]  Just tell us and make sure you get the address right.
[01:32:45.676 --> 01:32:47.017]  Because we've had people give us the wrong address.
[01:32:47.517 --> 01:32:56.760]  Give us the right address, their name, in the comment section if you want us to have a comment from you like, hey, I have these videos sent to ya, bro, or mom, or dad, or son.
[01:32:56.780 --> 01:33:01.782]  Because sometimes people go tell us to drop ship something and they don't know what it is or who they got it from.
[01:33:01.802 --> 01:33:04.963]  But you can put in the comment section that you want your note added to it.
[01:33:05.143 --> 01:33:05.923]  It's easy to do.
[01:33:07.159 --> 01:33:09.562]  They're on the Yahoo Secure shopping cart.
[01:33:10.282 --> 01:33:20.133]  You can go to Infowars.com and order America Freedom from Fascism, 9-11 Mysteries Demolitions, my new film Terror Storm, the history of state sponsored terror.

[01:33:39.114 --> 01:33:40.755]  We want them to get out there to the people.
[01:33:41.276 --> 01:33:51.664]  And when you purchase videos and books from us, you fund our operation and what we're doing defending this republic from enemies foreign and domestic and the multinational corporations that have seized control of our bureaucracies and our government.

[01:35:08.152 --> 01:35:10.697]  PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:35:14.243 --> 01:35:19.453]  There's no subscription service out there with this much material that low, but you can beat it if you get our other special.

[01:35:53.738 --> 01:35:54.819]  Thank you to the current members.
[01:35:55.339 --> 01:35:57.540]  All right, going back to Tom Kimmel.
[01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:06.345]  Tom, any websites, any books, any important materials you want to recommend to folks out there to fully understand what really happened at Pearl Harbor and why it's so important?
[01:36:07.346 --> 01:36:08.106]  You bet, Alex.
[01:36:08.527 --> 01:36:10.127]  You might start with my website.
[01:36:10.948 --> 01:36:15.050]  My website is pearlharbor911attacks.com.
[01:36:18.596 --> 01:36:22.179]  In there I list much information, which is of value.
[01:36:23.260 --> 01:36:29.226]  I also recommend, of course, my grandfather's book, which he wrote in 1954, reprinted in 1955.
[01:36:29.366 --> 01:36:31.067]  It's a terrific book.
[01:36:31.468 --> 01:36:34.310]  It's available for free on the Internet.
[01:36:35.091 --> 01:36:43.439]  Probably the best way to get it is to Google Admiral Kimmel's story, and it'll come right up, and you'll have a complete, excellently rendered
[01:36:45.772 --> 01:36:46.732]  Copy of that book.
[01:36:46.973 --> 01:36:51.214]  Now I'm going to get a hundred emails later, because people are interested and there's millions listening.
[01:36:51.694 --> 01:36:52.935]  Slowly, give us your website.
[01:36:52.955 --> 01:36:55.015]  We've got a link to it on InfoWars.com.
[01:36:55.536 --> 01:37:00.838]  But slowly, Mr. Kimmel, and then tell us the name of your grandfather's book again.
[01:37:01.778 --> 01:37:11.602]  Okay, well the website is Pearl Harbor 9-1-1 Attacks, A-T-T-A-C-K-S Attacks dot com.
[01:37:11.942 --> 01:37:15.363]  Pearl Harbor 9-1-1 Attacks dot com.
[01:37:16.315 --> 01:37:30.722]  In there, you'll find a link to Admiral Kimmel's story, but another way to get to Admiral Kimmel's story, which is my grandfather's book, is to Google Admiral Kimmel's story, and you'll immediately go to a website that gives you a complete rendering of his book.
[01:37:30.802 --> 01:37:31.943]  It's an excellent book.
[01:37:32.023 --> 01:37:33.844]  Of course, I highly recommend the book.
[01:37:34.524 --> 01:37:37.466]  There's not an actual error in the entire book.
[01:37:38.586 --> 01:37:40.207]  You can't say that about many books.
[01:37:40.934 --> 01:37:47.346]  At any rate, if you want a current book on the subject, Pearl Harbor Betrayed would be my recommendation.
[01:37:47.406 --> 01:37:48.869]  Written by Michael Gannon.
[01:37:48.969 --> 01:37:50.352]  G-A-N-N-O-N.
[01:37:50.392 --> 01:37:51.554]  Pearl Harbor Betrayed.
[01:37:53.573 --> 01:37:59.015]  Well, he is a terrific scholar and a gentleman, has come up with all kinds of brand new information.
[01:37:59.475 --> 01:38:02.716]  His book was written in 2000-2001.
[01:38:02.736 --> 01:38:10.638]  He even came up with information which he couldn't quite put into the book, unfortunately, which is terrific, and he has given that information
[01:38:11.278 --> 01:38:15.680]  On several occasions at the National Press Club and in other forums.
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:22.562]  Well this is important because you're not just getting your family name back for your grandfather and his record.
[01:38:22.582 --> 01:38:34.566]  Has it happened or how far away are we from being able to get his disgraceful mark that they falsely put on him out of the official records?
[01:38:35.566 --> 01:38:39.488]  Well the only thing necessary would be a wave of a hand by
[01:38:41.275 --> 01:38:43.577]  The President of the United States, that would do it.
[01:38:44.458 --> 01:38:48.180]  There's quite an announcement going on on this cruise ship behind me, so I don't know if I'm... It's okay.
[01:38:48.561 --> 01:38:49.421]  We're getting there.
[01:38:49.441 --> 01:38:49.642]  Okay.
[01:38:49.902 --> 01:38:50.502]  Okay, good.
[01:38:52.244 --> 01:39:05.414]  This might be a good time to give you the genesis of this Advancement on the Retired List initiative for Admiral Kimball and General Short, because it plays right into today's current political climate.
[01:39:05.634 --> 01:39:05.894]  Yes.
[01:39:06.014 --> 01:39:08.296]  So let me start with that, first of all.
[01:39:09.048 --> 01:39:29.922]  The Pearl Harbor Survivors Association, the group most affected by the Pearl Harbor attack, they are the ones who initiated this idea of posthumous advancement for Rear Admiral Kimmel and Major General Short to their highest held temporary ranks in World War II of Full Admiral and Lieutenant General, respectively.
[01:39:30.642 --> 01:39:31.563]  Now here's how it worked.
[01:39:32.123 --> 01:39:32.203]  In 1984,
[01:39:33.914 --> 01:39:53.048]  The head of the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association at that time, Alex Cobb, met with my dad and my uncle at a restaurant in New York and said, we, the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association, the group most affected by the Pearl Harbor attack, we are tired of the disgraceful humiliation and scapegoating of our commanders.
[01:39:53.708 --> 01:39:57.551]  We want to do something to rehabilitate their reputation and honor.
[01:39:58.058 --> 01:40:02.721]  And we want you, the sole surviving sons of Admiral Kimball, to assist us.
[01:40:02.781 --> 01:40:03.601]  Will you do that?
[01:40:03.801 --> 01:40:08.444]  And of course, my dad and my uncle looked at each other and said, who are we to say anything but yes to that?
[01:40:09.085 --> 01:40:10.265]  That's where it started.
[01:40:10.986 --> 01:40:13.087]  Now, very interestingly, we jump to 1989.
[01:40:13.367 --> 01:40:21.572]  Then Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney wrote a letter to a Wyoming constituent.
[01:40:22.285 --> 01:40:31.167]  In which he listed four things that the Kimmel family should do to promote the advancement initiative of the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association.
[01:40:32.108 --> 01:40:41.710]  They were, number one, get the specific written recommendation of the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association in a resolution recommending this advancement.
[01:40:42.391 --> 01:40:43.591]  So, of course, we did that.
[01:40:44.605 --> 01:40:58.538]  We have gotten two of these resolutions from the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association, but as a result directly of this council by then Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney to get the specific recommendations, we did that.
[01:40:58.578 --> 01:40:59.759]  That was the number one thing.
[01:41:00.319 --> 01:41:04.103]  The number two thing that the Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney said to do
[01:41:04.958 --> 01:41:16.224]  was to get the specific recommendation of the then living most revered naval officer at the time who was former Chief of Naval Operations Arlie Burke.
[01:41:17.024 --> 01:41:22.547]  Arlie Burke was the longest tenured Chief of Naval Operations in American history.
[01:41:22.587 --> 01:41:29.510]  He was Chief of Naval Operations for six years and obviously Secretary of Defense Cheney thought much of his opinion.
[01:41:30.228 --> 01:41:36.870]  He specifically wanted the Kimmel family to get the written opinion of Arlie Burke, which we did.
[01:41:37.350 --> 01:41:39.631]  And Arlie Burke's opinion was marvelous.
[01:41:39.671 --> 01:41:42.732]  It could not have been better for our effort.
[01:41:43.412 --> 01:41:46.173]  Arlie Burke said, look, this is important.
[01:41:46.913 --> 01:41:50.194]  Not because of its importance to the Kimmel family.
[01:41:50.294 --> 01:41:55.756]  This is important because of its importance to the Navy as an institution.
[01:41:56.463 --> 01:41:57.284]  So what did Cheney do?
[01:42:17.788 --> 01:42:30.137]  Well, and I think the third thing that was recommended by Secretary of Defense Cheney was to get the voices of the Times, is the way he's styled it in this letter, which I'd be delighted to send to you.
[01:42:30.197 --> 01:42:32.138]  Well, listen, let me make a long story short.
[01:42:32.158 --> 01:42:32.919]  They haven't done it.
[01:42:32.959 --> 01:42:35.181]  You guys got everything you were supposed to get.
[01:42:35.241 --> 01:42:40.424]  Now, I want to digress back to what we were talking about earlier, if we can, Mr. Kimmel.
[01:42:40.444 --> 01:42:43.867]  Tom Kimmel, we were talking to the grandson of Admiral Husband Kimmel.
[01:42:45.143 --> 01:42:46.044]  We were talking about 9-11.
[01:42:46.204 --> 01:42:48.826]  Now, I'm sure you're very well informed.
[01:42:48.867 --> 01:42:59.937]  I don't know if you're informed on this, but I'm sure you heard about all the FBI agents that, quote, heard about what was going to happen but were blocked from doing anything, and then they were gagged and told to shut up by the White House.
[01:43:00.898 --> 01:43:05.362]  Is that a cover-up when FBI agents are given national security letters?
[01:43:06.062 --> 01:43:07.624]  And I've got the National Press Club video.
[01:43:08.404 --> 01:43:11.645]  Well, first of all I'm not aware of that allegation that you've made.
[01:43:11.665 --> 01:43:12.545]  Would that be a cover up?
[01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:52.010]  Well, there would be information that would be of interest to the public, and if it's indeed factual, it would be a cover-up in the sense that there's pertinent relevant information to the attack, which is being withheld.
[01:43:52.230 --> 01:43:53.491]  I mean, let's get down to the bottom line.
[01:43:53.511 --> 01:43:55.113]  Let's get down to the bottom line, because I respect you.
[01:43:55.133 --> 01:44:00.076]  Former FBI agent, naval officer, and I'm trying to, you know, get right down to brass tacks here.
[01:44:00.577 --> 01:44:03.979]  Okay, it's totally... Sorry, go ahead.
[01:44:04.380 --> 01:44:05.981]  Let me tell you what a real cover-up is.
[01:44:06.041 --> 01:44:07.682]  A real cover-up would be the following.
[01:44:08.251 --> 01:44:19.184]  It would be if these FBI agents were ordered not to reveal information, which should be in the public domain.
[01:44:19.765 --> 01:44:24.931]  They were, and they were ordered not to drop their investigations of the supposed hijackers.
[01:44:26.112 --> 01:44:28.033]  Well, let's go back to the Pearl Harbor model.
[01:44:28.073 --> 01:44:29.114]  It's a model for everything.
[01:44:29.174 --> 01:44:31.535]  It's the reason why I think lessons have not been learned.
[01:44:32.195 --> 01:44:38.078]  We know because of an affidavit filed by the head of Army Intelligence, General Miles.
[01:44:38.618 --> 01:44:52.986]  General Miles was explaining why he, General Miles, lied to the Army Pearl Harbor Board in an affidavit, which is part of the Joint Congressional Committee's report taken by Henry Clausen, which was one of the ten investigations in that
[01:44:54.439 --> 01:45:10.528]  The head of Army Intelligence says he was approached by Generals Clark and Osmond transmitting orders from General Marshall that he, General Miles, was not to tell the truth to the Army Pearl Harbor Board.
[01:45:11.118 --> 01:45:14.159]  And that's why he didn't tell the truth to the Army Pearl Harbor Board.
[01:45:14.259 --> 01:45:15.080]  Incredible.
[01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:17.161]  That's contained in an affidavit.
[01:45:17.221 --> 01:45:24.084]  So active cover-ups to then frame the head of the Army and the head of the Navy in the Pacific.
[01:45:25.084 --> 01:45:27.305]  Well, that was the effect.
[01:45:27.365 --> 01:45:29.486]  Whether that was the intention or not, I don't know.
[01:45:29.546 --> 01:45:31.347]  But that most definitely was the effect.
[01:45:32.225 --> 01:45:39.747]  Because obviously, if Admiral Kimmel had the same information in Hawaii as they had in Washington, D.C., then Admiral Kimmel is guilty as charged.
[01:45:39.767 --> 01:45:44.048]  Now, I want to get into some of the new info that's come out, but I want to go back here for a minute.
[01:45:44.388 --> 01:45:48.589]  I want to boil it down to its most, you know, simplest building blocks, okay?
[01:45:49.229 --> 01:45:54.711]  I have the declassified after-action report from 1953 from Kermit Roosevelt.
[01:45:54.731 --> 01:45:55.851]  You probably know about this.
[01:45:56.739 --> 01:46:13.824]  Uh, to 10 Downing Street and to President Eisenhower, uh, at Pennsylvania Avenue, where Comrade Roosevelt says, we staged terror attacks in Iran, blowing up buildings, shooting people, hiring thugs, to then blame the attacks on Mohammad Mossadegh to overthrow that government.
[01:46:14.545 --> 01:46:16.665]  Uh, General Schwarzkopf's father was involved.
[01:46:16.725 --> 01:46:17.525]  It's all in there.
[01:46:17.665 --> 01:46:18.986]  He's one of the 12 doing it.
[01:46:19.826 --> 01:46:23.869]  Running the op with the millions of dollars, with British intelligence, MI6 at the time.
[01:46:24.389 --> 01:46:31.553]  We have a government that knowingly had broken the Purple Code, knowingly knew submarines were coming in, had sunk them, still nothing was done.
[01:46:32.374 --> 01:46:33.815]  All of this stuff is happening.
[01:46:34.475 --> 01:46:39.378]  We have the fact that the Japanese staff is leaving the embassies in the days before.
[01:46:39.718 --> 01:46:41.700]  They know the date of the attack weeks before.
[01:46:42.020 --> 01:46:43.501]  They know all of this is happening.
[01:46:43.541 --> 01:46:44.501]  They keep it from the Navy.
[01:46:44.541 --> 01:46:45.482]  They keep it from the Army.
[01:46:45.902 --> 01:46:48.604]  They let almost 3,000 Americans die.
[01:46:49.084 --> 01:46:50.005]  All of this happens.
[01:46:50.025 --> 01:46:53.707]  They have a 10-part plan, now public, to get Japan to attack us.
[01:46:54.108 --> 01:46:55.849]  So this is a provocateur action.
[01:46:55.869 --> 01:46:57.230]  You have provocateur actions.
[01:46:57.770 --> 01:47:00.912]  Then you have actions where our government stages attacks to blame it on people.
[01:47:01.553 --> 01:47:02.513]  And this is not our government.
[01:47:02.533 --> 01:47:03.934]  It's criminal elements in our government.
[01:47:04.175 --> 01:47:10.239]  You've got the Secretary of the State not wanting to go along with it, leaking it to the Associated Press, as you just mentioned, on Pearl Harbor.
[01:47:10.479 --> 01:47:14.942]  Bottom line, and I know it's painful, it doesn't reflect on you and individuals in the FBI and the government,
[01:47:15.382 --> 01:47:26.090]  Time and time again, though, criminal elements in our State Department, taken over by the CFR in the late 1920s, are basically orchestrating or provocateuring events to get us into wars.
[01:47:26.130 --> 01:47:27.551]  Now, is that or is that not happening?
[01:47:28.874 --> 01:47:38.138]  Well, you know, when I give my presentations, which I do all the time, I avoid a conspiracy theory because I can't prove a conspiracy theory.
[01:47:38.178 --> 01:47:40.019]  What I can prove is stupidity.
[01:47:40.479 --> 01:47:42.340]  So that's what I embrace.
[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:44.400]  You have to remember, I'm an FBI agent.
[01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:47.482]  I can't be going anywhere where the facts don't take me.
[01:47:47.502 --> 01:47:50.483]  Are you still currently in the FBI or are you retired?
[01:47:51.377 --> 01:47:51.897]  I'm retired.
[01:47:52.137 --> 01:47:53.918]  I retired twice, actually.
[01:47:53.978 --> 01:47:54.878]  First time was in 1998.
[01:47:55.218 --> 01:47:58.019]  I went back on contract and I retired again in 2000.
[01:47:58.119 --> 01:48:01.480]  Sure, but what I'm saying to you, Mr. Kimmel, is it's not a conspiracy theory.
[01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:09.803]  We have the after-action reports that elements of our government, in collusion with British intelligence, staged terror attacks to blame it on enemies.
[01:48:12.796 --> 01:48:17.258]  Well, you're out of my area of expertise when you start talking about Iran.
[01:48:17.338 --> 01:48:29.343]  But at CIA.gov, what I'm telling you is, if I send you admitted after-action reports, okay, showing our government stayed to convince Iran to blame it on the government, what would you say to that?
[01:48:30.703 --> 01:48:36.466]  Well, I am already aware of the revelations through the documentation of the code word, Northwoods.
[01:48:36.726 --> 01:48:39.567]  So, these things have happened, sure.
[01:48:40.527 --> 01:48:41.728]  What do you think about Northwoods?
[01:48:42.862 --> 01:48:57.470]  Well, that's a pretty clear indication that if we didn't engage in that kind of activity, we were certainly thinking about engaging in that kind of activity, because it's spelled out in documents that are undeniably clear.
[01:48:57.810 --> 01:49:04.153]  Does it scare you to know that if Kennedy wouldn't have said no to that, it would have been... I mean, that was an operational plan they were going ahead with.
[01:49:04.833 --> 01:49:07.795]  I mean, does it scare you to know that it came that close to staging attacks?
[01:49:09.516 --> 01:49:14.620]  It is something that we should all be highly concerned about, in my opinion, yes.
[01:49:15.980 --> 01:49:18.922]  Well, we appreciate your honesty and concern on that issue.
[01:49:18.942 --> 01:49:19.523]  We're going to break.
[01:49:19.583 --> 01:49:26.587]  Final segment, if you can, just encapsulate down the keys, some of the other things we haven't talked about with Pearl Harbor, with our guests.
[01:49:26.607 --> 01:49:36.294]  We have links to his website up on InfoWars.com, and we've also recommended some of the books you can get, or even a free book, e-book, you can read that his grandfather wrote in the 50s.
[01:49:37.665 --> 01:49:39.127]  We're just getting the facts out here.
[01:49:39.167 --> 01:49:44.315]  We don't like where they lead us, but if we don't face the facts, none of us are going to have any freedom or liberty.
[01:49:45.376 --> 01:49:47.540]  Bottom line, they're staging terror to take our freedoms.
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:48.381]  Bottom line.
[01:49:55.231 --> 01:49:55.711]  It's here!
[01:49:55.931 --> 01:50:00.674]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:01.074 --> 01:50:08.718]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:09.418 --> 01:50:16.462]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:16.862 --> 01:50:23.726]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:50:24.235 --> 01:50:28.278]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:28.578 --> 01:50:32.081]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:32.561 --> 01:50:34.442]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:34.802 --> 01:50:38.725]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:52:55.157 --> 01:53:00.160]  Day after day, alone on a hill,
[01:53:01.903 --> 01:53:07.525]  The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still.
[01:53:08.005 --> 01:53:11.187]  But nobody wants to know him.
[01:53:11.607 --> 01:53:15.248]  They can see that he's just a fool.
[01:53:15.448 --> 01:53:17.769]  And he never gives an answer.
[01:53:18.130 --> 01:53:24.312]  But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down.
[01:53:25.012 --> 01:53:31.575]  And the eyes in his head see the world spinning round.
[01:53:32.688 --> 01:53:33.268]  Welcome back.
[01:53:34.308 --> 01:53:42.970]  Tom Kimmel, former naval officer and FBI agent, joins us via his vacation out in Hawaii on a cruise ship via cell phone.
[01:53:42.990 --> 01:53:43.790]  We're very honored to have him.
[01:53:44.030 --> 01:53:45.591]  He'll be with us for this second, then the next.
[01:53:46.731 --> 01:53:50.431]  Then Judge Napolitano will be joining us.
[01:53:50.511 --> 01:53:52.572]  And boy, I tell you, he breaks from the fox pack.
[01:53:53.532 --> 01:53:58.213]  His new book, How the Federal Government Has Seized Power by Rewriting the Supreme Law of the Land.
[01:53:59.088 --> 01:54:03.173]  The Constitution in Exile is the book, and I've had a chance to scan it.
[01:54:03.213 --> 01:54:03.753]  I haven't read it.
[01:54:03.773 --> 01:54:04.754]  I just got it two days ago.
[01:54:05.195 --> 01:54:06.777]  But I've read a few chapters and scans.
[01:54:07.257 --> 01:54:08.138]  It's powerful.
[01:54:09.059 --> 01:54:12.363]  So more and more people are looking at what's happening and saying, this isn't America.
[01:54:12.763 --> 01:54:16.067]  And none of it, quote, keeps us safe from Al-Qaeda.
[01:54:18.354 --> 01:54:29.138]  But going back in the ten minutes or so we've got left in this segment and the next, Mr. Kimmel, hit some of the areas, some of the key areas of what really happened at Pearl Harbor.
[01:54:29.158 --> 01:54:36.740]  Kind of sum up the reality of what Roosevelt and the State Department really did and why this is such an important lesson.
[01:54:38.143 --> 01:54:53.041]  Well, it's an important lesson because of the repeat of the mistakes that were made at Pearl Harbor, which certainly didn't help us out in the 9-11 scenario, and I fear might not help us out in the next 9-11 scenario.
[01:54:53.801 --> 01:54:55.684]  Let me give you an example.
[01:54:56.964 --> 01:55:11.170]  In Pearl Harbor, the vast majority of damage was caused to happen by airdropped shallow water running torpedoes that the prevailing wisdom at the time thought was a secret weapon.
[01:55:11.230 --> 01:55:13.891]  That's the way it was styled by the Naval Court of Inquiry.
[01:55:15.051 --> 01:55:23.995]  Every tribunal would have to confront the issue of shallow water torpedoes and did we have advanced information about that capability?
[01:55:25.192 --> 01:55:31.439]  The findings on all of these truck vehicles was, no, we didn't have any advanced information about that.
[01:55:31.919 --> 01:55:33.781]  Well, of course that's not true.
[01:55:34.342 --> 01:55:40.209]  We found that in 1998, declassified by the Navy, in 1998 was a report from their then Naval Attaché to London.
[01:55:46.865 --> 01:55:50.214]  Admiral Lockwood, the famous Admiral Lockwood of Submarine Specific.
[01:55:50.635 --> 01:55:55.127]  But prior to Pearl Harbor, he was a naval attache in London.
[01:55:56.042 --> 01:56:07.445]  On July 15, 1941, six months prior to Pearl Harbor, six months prior to Pearl Harbor, he sent a report from London to the Navy Department in Washington, D.C.
[01:56:07.965 --> 01:56:20.828]  saying that the British had developed a shallow water-running, air-dropped torpedo capable of successfully enabling and operating in water as shallow as 24 feet.
[01:56:22.774 --> 01:56:36.241]  This information would have been a bombshell at any of the tribunals, but most specifically at the 1946 Joint Congressional Committee hearing, because there it was determined that there was no such information.
[01:56:36.321 --> 01:56:37.421]  And why is that important?
[01:56:37.462 --> 01:56:38.282]  Explain that to people.
[01:56:39.244 --> 01:56:45.567]  Because it was the cause of the vast majority of damage at Pearl Harbor.
[01:56:45.987 --> 01:56:54.732]  The fact that the Japanese could fly a plane, drop a torpedo in shallow water, have it be effective, caused most of the damage at Pearl Harbor.
[01:56:55.132 --> 01:56:55.652]  Most of it.
[01:56:56.313 --> 01:57:03.236]  It was felt that battleships in Pearl Harbor were immune from that kind of attack because of the shallow water.
[01:57:04.257 --> 01:57:08.779]  Over a year before, the British had successfully attacked the Italian fleet at Toronto.
[01:57:10.888 --> 01:57:26.463]  But it's also come out they even knew from the codes, the military and the diplomatic codes, that the Japanese were planning an attack and that they had the, what was it, lighter wooden backed torpedoes, and I'm going from memory here, enlightening on the other side.
[01:57:26.844 --> 01:57:29.146]  So they knew those ships tied together were sitting ducks.
[01:57:29.466 --> 01:57:30.067]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:31.744 --> 01:57:36.656]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:48.118 --> 01:57:48.758]  Big Brother.
[01:57:49.419 --> 01:57:50.479]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:52.280]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:52.981 --> 01:57:53.761]  You want answers?
[01:57:54.541 --> 01:57:55.422]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:55.442 --> 01:57:59.744]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:00.284 --> 01:58:04.387]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.488 --> 01:58:12.551]  The famous director, David Lynch, has gone public on 9-11.
[01:58:12.591 --> 01:58:14.592]  We'll be recapping that later in the hour.
[01:58:14.672 --> 01:58:16.413]  So has the big actor, James Brolin.
[01:58:20.498 --> 01:58:26.960]  Pretty big news because this always has a large effect with the generally dumbed down public looking into 9-11.
[01:58:27.460 --> 01:58:30.581]  We'll tell you more about those articles we wrote last night on that subject.
[01:58:31.422 --> 01:58:44.666]  We're in our final four minutes or so with Tom Kimmel, grandson of Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, who was wrongfully shouldered with the blame for Pearl Harbor when he was deliberately blocked from learning about the sneak attack plan
[01:58:45.686 --> 01:58:50.508]  And we are talking to his grandson right now, who is in the last four minutes now, finishing up.
[01:58:50.568 --> 01:58:51.628]  Any other key points?
[01:58:51.669 --> 01:58:52.289]  Please continue.
[01:58:53.609 --> 01:59:05.514]  Well, probably the best way we can honor the memory of those fallen at Pearl Harbor, and there were 2,403 men murdered at Pearl Harbor, if we're going to tell it like it is.
[01:59:06.054 --> 01:59:09.776]  The best way we can honor them would be follow the
[01:59:10.806 --> 01:59:20.749]  Uh, initiative of the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association and restore the ranks or advance posthumously on the retired list, Admiral Kimmel and General Short.
[01:59:21.190 --> 01:59:31.113]  And we should do this not only in accordance with the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association's specific recommendations, but we should do it because the Congress passed a law
[01:59:31.773 --> 01:59:50.116]  recommending in perpetuity, in perpetuity, that the President of the United States, whoever he is now, or whoever he or she may be in the future, Alex, that they should advance Rear Admiral Kimmel and Major General Short to their highest held temporary ranks in World War II in accordance with the Officer Personnel Act of 1947.
[01:59:51.036 --> 02:00:00.418]  That law was passed by the Congress October 15, 2000, and it was signed into law October 30th by President Clinton.
[02:00:01.078 --> 02:00:03.120]  But President Clinton did not take the action.
[02:00:03.860 --> 02:00:14.328]  And we are denied any kind of full explanation as to why this action is not being taken by the current administration.
[02:00:15.189 --> 02:00:23.695]  We have found that the current administration reviewed the matter and the reviewers wrote it up in a bifurcated fashion.
[02:00:23.915 --> 02:00:26.077]  In other words, they wrote up a memoranda
[02:00:26.647 --> 02:00:31.131]  It's a memorandum indicating that the action should be taken and they listed all the reasons.
[02:00:31.191 --> 02:00:32.712]  That was memorandum number one.
[02:00:33.372 --> 02:00:39.698]  Memorandum number two was the same kind of thing, only this time why the action should not be taken.
[02:00:40.378 --> 02:00:48.905]  So we have tried to obtain both of these memoranda, but we are only provided the one that indicated they should not take the action.
[02:00:49.731 --> 02:00:52.012]  And of course, it is heavily redacted.
[02:00:52.452 --> 02:00:56.173]  We are unable to determine who actually wrote the memorandum.
[02:00:56.493 --> 02:01:04.155]  Or what lies, or what lies, they yet again, including themselves in the crime, were foisted upon your grandfather and the general.
[02:01:05.096 --> 02:01:06.616]  You may like this one, Alex.
[02:01:06.676 --> 02:01:12.278]  The reason we are denied knowledge of who wrote the memorandum is under a terrorist theory.
[02:01:12.811 --> 02:01:21.040]  In other words, revealing who it was that wrote the memorandum might expose them to some sort of terrorist retribution.
[02:01:21.340 --> 02:01:22.461]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:01:22.481 --> 02:01:28.467]  They're using 9-11 to make where they dump toxic waste secret, or how much money's been stolen from the Pentagon secret.
[02:01:28.487 --> 02:01:29.548]  It's a license for crime.
[02:01:29.949 --> 02:01:33.512]  Sir, I want to thank you for coming on our broadcast.
[02:01:33.552 --> 02:01:35.735]  I want to thank you for your
[02:01:36.949 --> 02:01:37.410]  We're good to go.
[02:01:53.165 --> 02:01:59.587]  Indeed, I am busy, but this is what's keeping me alive now, so I look forward to the next one.
[02:01:59.607 --> 02:02:01.727]  Maybe we can do this again next year, if not sooner.
[02:02:02.128 --> 02:02:03.668]  Absolutely, but I'll tell you this.
[02:02:03.708 --> 02:02:09.009]  Your grandfather, your father, and yourself and others have gotten their names back in the court of public opinion.
[02:02:09.269 --> 02:02:18.252]  They've had major polls where 90 plus percent of Americans know that Pearl Harbor was a setup and know that your grandfather and others were hung out to dry.
[02:02:18.272 --> 02:02:19.092]  I'm sure you're aware of that.
[02:02:20.672 --> 02:02:22.874]  Well, thanks for your assistance in this matter.
[02:02:23.114 --> 02:02:23.435]  You bet.
[02:02:23.475 --> 02:02:23.835]  Take care.
[02:02:23.855 --> 02:02:24.576]  Have a good vacation.
[02:02:25.237 --> 02:02:25.597]  Okay.
[02:02:25.617 --> 02:02:26.238]  So long, Alex.
[02:02:26.638 --> 02:02:27.359]  Vaya con Dios.
[02:02:27.499 --> 02:02:27.919]  All right.
[02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:35.548]  Judge Napolitano is scheduled to be popping in with us with his new book, and then I've got a bunch of other news I want to be covering.
[02:02:36.128 --> 02:02:38.651]  And we may even have time to jam in a few calls.
[02:02:39.852 --> 02:02:40.573]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:02:40.653 --> 02:02:42.055]  It's Genesis Communications.
[02:02:46.787 --> 02:02:47.267]  It's here!
[02:02:47.488 --> 02:02:52.272]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:52.632 --> 02:03:00.298]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:00.958 --> 02:03:08.024]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:08.424 --> 02:03:15.350]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spies,
[02:03:15.788 --> 02:03:19.829]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:20.149 --> 02:03:23.750]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:24.110 --> 02:03:26.051]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:26.371 --> 02:03:30.292]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:43.553 --> 02:03:45.395]  Dad, can we stop?
[02:03:45.735 --> 02:03:47.276]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[02:03:47.676 --> 02:03:47.937]  What?
[02:03:48.277 --> 02:03:48.637]  Again?
[02:03:49.057 --> 02:03:50.699]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[02:03:50.759 --> 02:03:55.182]  Honey, let's stop because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[02:03:55.423 --> 02:03:56.724]  Why did you do that?
[02:03:56.924 --> 02:04:02.728]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[02:04:03.009 --> 02:04:04.050]  Are we there yet?
[02:04:04.150 --> 02:04:05.231]  for the entire trip.
[02:04:05.471 --> 02:04:07.672]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[02:04:08.153 --> 02:04:09.174]  Great idea.
[02:04:09.454 --> 02:04:12.016]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[02:04:12.372 --> 02:04:14.839]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[02:04:15.059 --> 02:04:19.451]  And using our Bertie Sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[02:04:19.732 --> 02:04:20.033]  Honey!
[02:04:20.854 --> 02:04:22.095]  You're terrific!
[02:04:22.495 --> 02:04:23.975]  Oh, honey, so are you!
[02:04:24.095 --> 02:04:27.497]  You're the one that bought the family our Sport Berkey Water Bottles!
[02:04:27.777 --> 02:04:28.578]  Now can we stop?
[02:04:29.058 --> 02:04:29.818]  I need to go, too.
[02:04:30.098 --> 02:04:34.540]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:34.900]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:34.940 --> 02:04:36.501]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:04:43.877 --> 02:04:46.299]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[02:04:46.799 --> 02:04:50.122]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[02:04:50.502 --> 02:04:53.444]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[02:04:53.725 --> 02:05:00.090]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[02:05:00.170 --> 02:05:04.573]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[02:05:04.793 --> 02:05:09.155]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[02:05:09.316 --> 02:05:11.917]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[02:05:11.957 --> 02:05:14.718]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[02:05:15.179 --> 02:05:17.720]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:22.022]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[02:05:22.082 --> 02:05:22.923]  Treasury bonds.
[02:05:23.203 --> 02:05:27.826]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[02:05:28.006 --> 02:05:29.647]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:05:29.667 --> 02:05:31.848]  That's 1-888-8XANADU or 1-888-XANADU and ask for George.
[02:05:44.546 --> 02:05:50.188]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:50.288 --> 02:06:06.093]  Alright, let's run through a bunch of important news right now.
[02:06:06.573 --> 02:06:09.034]  We did spend the last hour on Pearl Harbor.
[02:06:09.054 --> 02:06:12.555]  It is the 65th anniversary of that staged event, that provocateur event.
[02:06:14.426 --> 02:06:17.647]  The FDA rejects new limits on mercury in vaccines.
[02:06:19.867 --> 02:06:23.628]  Group petitioned government to restrict the use of controversial preservative.
[02:06:24.268 --> 02:06:31.730]  Associated Press, federal health officials, won't put new restrictions on the use of mercury-based preservatives in vaccines and other medicines.
[02:06:31.850 --> 02:06:32.790]  Other medicines.
[02:06:32.910 --> 02:06:33.591]  Hundreds of it.
[02:06:35.411 --> 02:06:39.192]  Denying a petition that sought to limit it because of health concerns.
[02:06:41.272 --> 02:06:43.693]  Now there's no debate that it has a horrible electrochemical
[02:06:44.838 --> 02:06:45.759]  Reaction in the brain.
[02:06:48.280 --> 02:06:50.221]  It's the worst substance in the brain.
[02:06:50.561 --> 02:06:54.963]  It causes an electrical short in the neurons, not just the toxic effect.
[02:06:56.724 --> 02:07:10.932]  A group called the Coalition for Mercury-Free Drugs petitioned the Food and Drug Administration in 2004, seeking the restrictions on Thimerosal, citing concerns the preservative is linked to autism and a rapidly... We replied to it September 26,
[02:07:12.412 --> 02:07:16.373]  But made public only Tuesday, the FDA rejected the petition.
[02:07:17.734 --> 02:07:32.238]  Only a small number of licensed and approved products still contain thimerosal, and the available evidence supports FDA's conclusion that all currently licensed vaccines and other pharmacological drug products containing thimerosal are safe.
[02:07:33.718 --> 02:07:35.519]  Dr. Jeffrey Shuren,
[02:07:36.724 --> 02:07:42.730]  The FDA's Assistant Commissioner for Policy wrote in denying the petition.
[02:07:44.913 --> 02:07:51.119]  Now let's put on our thinking caps, but more than just our thinking caps, our memory caps.
[02:07:52.461 --> 02:07:58.407]  The last five years, because of campaigns by different autistic organizations and the Autistic Society and
[02:08:00.239 --> 02:08:16.064]  Back in 2003, the 2000 minutes from the CDC got released where they were admitting it had brain damaged millions and caused autism to go from unknown to an epidemic and that they wouldn't give their own children or grandchildren any drug or any vaccine with it in it.
[02:08:17.485 --> 02:08:18.385]  That stuff got leaked.
[02:08:18.705 --> 02:08:21.366]  Congressman Dan Burton's committee made a big stink over it.
[02:08:22.966 --> 02:08:28.608]  So the news then had a big PR drive to tell you it had been taken out of all vaccines and drugs.
[02:08:29.716 --> 02:08:43.042]  Now what they did was, by a FDA regulation, was order vaccine makers to make small lots available to health care providers if they requested them.
[02:08:43.982 --> 02:08:50.285]  There are available, if you know where to get them, and most hospitals and doctor's offices and pediatricians don't even know they can get them.
[02:08:50.525 --> 02:08:53.627]  You have to tell them if you believe in vaccines and they can order them.
[02:08:54.007 --> 02:08:57.168]  And they cost, in some cases, as I've checked into it, 10 times.
[02:09:00.370 --> 02:09:02.112]  So, uh, nice sleight of hand.
[02:09:02.152 --> 02:09:05.454]  This is how these, this is all lawyer speak, double speak, you see.
[02:09:05.895 --> 02:09:08.577]  Oh, we took all the mercury out.
[02:09:08.597 --> 02:09:11.039]  No, the mercury is out of the vaccines.
[02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:20.186]  And then when they show it on Good Morning America, which I have a tape of them doing, they show a particular sub, uh, lot release that doesn't have it.
[02:09:21.787 --> 02:09:25.150]  And then I, well, it uses some type of salts to preserve it.
[02:09:26.371 --> 02:09:27.192]  Which isn't bad for you.
[02:09:27.772 --> 02:09:30.633]  But then, Lord knows, if they'll deal with mercury, what else is in those vaccines?
[02:09:30.653 --> 02:09:36.076]  We've caught them putting hormones in, sterilization agents, chemicals, and that's been the news.
[02:09:36.096 --> 02:09:36.897]  The back of the paper.
[02:09:37.697 --> 02:09:39.658]  So this is how dumb they think we are.
[02:09:39.698 --> 02:09:40.799]  How dumb they think you are.
[02:09:41.839 --> 02:09:44.121]  And then I have other AP reports, because AP does a good job.
[02:09:44.181 --> 02:09:44.721]  You will see it.
[02:09:44.761 --> 02:09:49.684]  I've got it posted in our Vaccine and Toxica section there on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:09:49.704 --> 02:09:50.964]  I forget the exact name of the section.
[02:09:50.984 --> 02:09:51.805]  It's in there.
[02:09:52.432 --> 02:10:08.948]  from three years ago, where they came out and said, actually, contrary to popular belief, they only made lots available without it, very small numbers of it, and just a few percentage points of the vaccine is available with it, and it also spoils, so most of it gets thrown away.
[02:10:08.968 --> 02:10:17.616]  They said, and actually we don't know why this has been done, but they have increased the standard flu shot
[02:10:18.246 --> 02:10:42.457]  And the manufacturers all privately agree on their own standards, there within the FDA standards, but it's a wide variant there, but they agree upon specific standards, that for the average weight of an American, that 50 times safe levels of mercury are in a flu shot.
[02:10:43.637 --> 02:10:44.898]  It was even higher for MMR.
[02:10:45.058 --> 02:10:45.838]  This was in the AP.
[02:10:46.459 --> 02:10:47.059]  Great report!
[02:10:47.893 --> 02:10:51.456]  Because it fits what we've gotten from medical experts and people on the field that we've interviewed here.
[02:10:53.877 --> 02:11:04.305]  They're increasing it from 50 times to 200 plus, because it was between 200 and 250 times the level that's safe.
[02:11:05.646 --> 02:11:16.594]  And then it reported that babies by the age of two have had three rounds of shots, MMR, measles, mumps, rubella, the pertosis,
[02:11:17.911 --> 02:11:31.441]  Uh, the tetanus, uh, the hepatitis three rounds, uh, the flu in many cases is now recommended, and they claim there's no law, there's no law, because they're total criminals.
[02:11:31.921 --> 02:11:33.042]  Think about the fraud!
[02:11:33.062 --> 02:11:34.903]  I mean, this is just scamming massively.
[02:11:35.844 --> 02:11:41.888]  And, uh, that little, what, at the age of two, the average weight is about 23 pounds.
[02:11:41.908 --> 02:11:42.829]  I'm going from memory here.
[02:11:42.869 --> 02:11:43.349]  Go look it up.
[02:11:43.449 --> 02:11:43.949]  Don't believe me.
[02:11:43.969 --> 02:11:45.510]  It's 23, 25 pounds.
[02:11:46.992 --> 02:11:58.802]  That it is, of course, many times worse than it being 200 plus times each shot safe level for the average weight of an adult is much higher than that of a two-year-old toddler.
[02:12:00.223 --> 02:12:06.748]  And in the majority of the cases with autistic children, they're running around, they're giggling, they're laughing, they have a great life.
[02:12:07.549 --> 02:12:15.676]  The third round, it gets so toxic that that is where children who do not have a genetic
[02:12:16.346 --> 02:12:27.055]  That even children who have the gene that blocks most of the mercury, because it's built into us, eating a lot of fish, natural mercury, God put it into us where it blocks most of it.
[02:12:39.475 --> 02:12:46.378]  Even children who have the normal gene to block the majority of the mercury toxify and within 24 hours are gone.
[02:12:47.398 --> 02:12:48.939]  How many of you listening right now are crying?
[02:12:48.979 --> 02:12:49.939]  You remember that day.
[02:12:49.959 --> 02:12:53.761]  Imagine the evil!
[02:12:53.781 --> 02:12:56.782]  I get chills right now.
[02:12:56.802 --> 02:12:59.523]  I just want to beat the daylights out of somebody.
[02:12:59.663 --> 02:13:01.644]  Hurting children makes me mad.
[02:13:01.884 --> 02:13:03.285]  My instinct is to protect them!
[02:13:04.425 --> 02:13:06.586]  And my instinct got a lot stronger after I had children.
[02:13:08.197 --> 02:13:12.439]  And I've been in a hotel on vacation in the hot tub talking to a mother who's got her autistic child.
[02:13:12.799 --> 02:13:20.202]  And I go, let me guess, at 18 months, at two years, a year and a half to two years, this happened, the third round, yes, yes.
[02:13:20.843 --> 02:13:28.726]  I've talked to the parents where the child gets the shot and by the time they get home they're having a seizure and the baby's brain is gone.
[02:13:29.806 --> 02:13:37.830]  And the hospital doesn't even tell them there's a detox that if you do in the first few weeks will probably reduce the brain damaging and they can come out of it.
[02:13:39.582 --> 02:13:40.762]  But you gotta get it out quick.
[02:13:43.544 --> 02:13:44.264]  This is sick!
[02:13:45.725 --> 02:13:46.505]  This is sick!
[02:13:49.526 --> 02:13:57.629]  The vast majority, and you've heard the medical doctors here, the vast majority are at the third round of shots.
[02:13:57.729 --> 02:14:06.393]  Now, we then see it in adults who have had more than three years consecutive flu shots.
[02:14:08.294 --> 02:14:08.454]  The
[02:14:09.881 --> 02:14:22.947]  The premature onset of dementia, which again, in a growing brain, going through neurological development, will totally fry them and you'll get an autistic child, in whatever degree that is.
[02:14:23.287 --> 02:14:30.290]  In the old, they've already developed their neural pathway, so you're just going to see a cognitive lowering or a general retardation.
[02:14:33.691 --> 02:14:38.193]  And I have, I was at the radio station this weekend, there was a guy there, and he was doing vaccine news,
[02:14:39.144 --> 02:14:42.647]  You know, I heard him chuffing and puffing when I came out, because there's a delay on it.
[02:14:42.967 --> 02:14:47.071]  I was talking about how deadly vaccines were, because he's told me how he likes, you know, to get the flu shot every year.
[02:14:47.591 --> 02:14:50.213]  And I just, I just want to, I want to help people!
[02:14:50.233 --> 02:14:55.458]  It's like a firefighter wants you to get, you know, he has an instinct, she has an instinct to help you.
[02:14:55.738 --> 02:14:56.859]  I just want to help people!
[02:14:59.375 --> 02:15:04.357]  I mean, I'm, you know, brought up, uh, type of dad who stopped and changed everybody's tires when they needed help.
[02:15:04.397 --> 02:15:06.058]  I mean, I'm just a, I'm just a fool.
[02:15:06.638 --> 02:15:08.399]  I'm just a, a, a soft touch.
[02:15:08.479 --> 02:15:09.359]  I'm a nice guy!
[02:15:09.840 --> 02:15:10.540]  Big teddy bear!
[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:11.680]  I'm mad!
[02:15:11.700 --> 02:15:15.202]  I mean, you can't even help these people!
[02:15:15.602 --> 02:15:16.683]  They don't want to be helped!
[02:15:17.063 --> 02:15:18.223]  They want to die young!
[02:15:18.704 --> 02:15:19.844]  They want to die in pain!
[02:15:20.264 --> 02:15:21.945]  They want to die with their brain gone!
[02:15:26.354 --> 02:15:38.559]  There is no debating that we had 1 in 24,000 children having it 25 years ago, and the numbers from 2 years ago are now old, and they're being officially collated.
[02:15:38.579 --> 02:15:42.380]  The old numbers were 1 in 168, now has autism.
[02:15:42.700 --> 02:15:43.720]  That's not over-reporting.
[02:15:44.081 --> 02:15:45.721]  They didn't exist 50 years ago, folks.
[02:15:45.761 --> 02:15:48.842]  Now, every public school has whole rooms full of poor autistic children.
[02:15:48.982 --> 02:15:50.323]  You know it, I know it, we've all seen it.
[02:15:50.563 --> 02:15:51.223]  We've got the numbers.
[02:15:51.263 --> 02:15:53.224]  But you can, not just the numbers, you can see it!
[02:15:56.184 --> 02:16:01.185]  The new numbers are coming out, and I've seen two different spreads, because they released preliminary before it happens.
[02:16:01.925 --> 02:16:04.366]  They're now saying autism is going to be between 1 in 76 and 105.
[02:16:04.566 --> 02:16:09.427]  Because there's a debate looking at the numbers, but they'll be official soon.
[02:16:11.788 --> 02:16:13.028]  You know it's going to get to 1 in 50.
[02:16:15.129 --> 02:16:15.489]  And 1 in 30.
[02:16:17.049 --> 02:16:17.389]  And 1 in 20.
[02:16:18.309 --> 02:16:24.371]  And they'll just keep telling you, all is good, keep taking the shot, keep taking the mercury, or there's no mercury in there, take it!
[02:16:25.188 --> 02:16:30.311]  When they've increased the mercury in the vaccines, and now other drugs.
[02:16:32.553 --> 02:16:44.941]  So, if you don't have a passion to warn people... I mean, right now, if down the street, somebody's house was on fire, and I knew about it, and I knew somebody wanted help, and I'd leave, you know, it's not anything special, I'd go help them!
[02:16:45.001 --> 02:16:45.681]  I'd go warn them!
[02:16:47.803 --> 02:16:53.086]  If you knew somebody was about to drink, you know, some cola with poison in it, you'd go warn them.
[02:16:55.467 --> 02:16:59.911]  But no, we're just supposed to sit here and take it, because our government wouldn't do it to us.
[02:16:59.931 --> 02:17:01.652]  Yeah, it's a huge eugenics program.
[02:17:02.753 --> 02:17:08.158]  Aldous Huxley, before he died in 62 at Berkeley, said that everything he put in the book was what the eugenicists had actually planned.
[02:17:08.178 --> 02:17:09.579]  He wrote the book in 33!
[02:17:11.060 --> 02:17:12.141]  And it's all coming true today!
[02:17:12.161 --> 02:17:16.805]  You know, where they x-ray the eggs before they're implanted to have a dumbed-down cast.
[02:17:18.546 --> 02:17:19.667]  People's whole potential!
[02:17:20.848 --> 02:17:21.509]  Being robbed!
[02:17:24.059 --> 02:17:25.940]  Autistic children everywhere!
[02:17:28.041 --> 02:17:32.483]  Advanced early onset of dementia in people 45, 50, 60 years old!
[02:17:33.744 --> 02:17:36.626]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:45.290 --> 02:17:47.611]  Hi folks, Jack Browner from Midas Resources.

[02:17:55.704 --> 02:17:57.104]  The Dow has ranged from 9,800 to 10,300.
[02:17:57.144 --> 02:17:57.564]  A 5% increase.
[02:17:58.165 --> 02:18:00.945]  The dollar's value has dropped from 96 cents to 70 cents against the euro.
[02:18:00.965 --> 02:18:04.286]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[02:18:04.306 --> 02:18:05.766]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s.
[02:18:05.806 --> 02:18:06.806]  A 16% increase in real money.
[02:18:19.721 --> 02:18:22.762]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[02:19:43.962 --> 02:19:46.444]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:46.985 --> 02:19:53.991]  Did you know that Bible prophecy talks about the United States, British Commonwealth, Russia, China, and the Communist world in the last days?
[02:19:54.931 --> 02:20:00.556]  Did you know that it predicts the confrontation between atheistic communism and the Western world of Christianity?
[02:20:01.297 --> 02:20:04.700]  The plans have already been laid and they conform to Bible prophecy.
[02:20:05.401 --> 02:20:14.959]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening and more about Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:20:45.208 --> 02:20:49.329]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:20:49.569 --> 02:20:51.310]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:20:51.590 --> 02:20:57.872]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:20:58.172 --> 02:21:04.273]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:21:04.533 --> 02:21:06.374]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:21:06.654 --> 02:21:06.935]  I think?

[02:21:33.598 --> 02:21:33.658]  1-866-885-6625.
[02:21:52.017 --> 02:21:53.317]  Welcome back!
[02:22:18.616 --> 02:22:25.622]  Last hour we had former naval officer, former FBI agent retired, grandson of Admiral Kimmel exposing how that was all provocateur, the fraud.
[02:22:25.642 --> 02:22:31.867]  And I tell you, I haven't read the whole book, I got it about two days ago, I've scanned through it, read a few chapters, got a lot of things marked here.
[02:22:32.307 --> 02:22:34.369]  I like a book that starts with Thomas Jefferson quotes.
[02:22:35.029 --> 02:22:37.992]  It's the Constitution in Exile, just out in the last few months.
[02:22:38.632 --> 02:22:46.899]  Judge Andrew P Napolitano, probably no stranger to this audience, he's been all over national TV, contributed to Fox News, Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst.
[02:22:47.595 --> 02:22:49.398]  And we are honored to have him on.
[02:22:49.498 --> 02:22:51.761]  In 1972, he graduated from Princeton University.
[02:22:52.081 --> 02:22:55.145]  In 1975, he graduated from the University of Notre Dame Law School.
[02:22:55.205 --> 02:23:00.172]  Judge Napolitano was the youngest life-tenured Superior Court judge in the history of the state of New Jersey.
[02:23:00.512 --> 02:23:01.834]  For 11 years, he was adjunct.
[02:23:02.532 --> 02:23:10.555]  Professor of Law at Seton Hall Law School, where he taught Constitutional Law and Jurisprudence, and was thrice voted Most Outstanding Professor.
[02:23:10.955 --> 02:23:14.316]  Judge Napolitano returned to private law practice in 1995.
[02:23:14.376 --> 02:23:18.957]  Yeah, you know, I watch Fox News sometimes and I just think, you know, this is out of control.
[02:23:19.017 --> 02:23:23.639]  The police state that's pushed, trying to say Bush is a conservative when he's about as conservative as a
[02:23:24.235 --> 02:23:25.096]  That's Bill Clinton.
[02:23:25.816 --> 02:23:29.718]  But then I see Napolitano, it's like this vein of sanity is found.
[02:23:30.198 --> 02:23:31.779]  And then I read the book, it's even more hardcore.
[02:23:31.799 --> 02:23:40.985]  I heard Gary Brownfield on this same Genesis Network a few months ago talk about some meeting he was at where he gave a speech and saw Napolitano gave a speech and was impressed by him.
[02:23:41.885 --> 02:23:44.427]  And here we have him with us for a little bit of time today.
[02:23:45.147 --> 02:23:49.870]  And again, I haven't read the whole book yet, but it's something you certainly should get because
[02:23:51.315 --> 02:23:55.817]  Because it's powerful and very well written, and nice and handsome as well.
[02:23:56.157 --> 02:23:57.937]  Judge, thanks for spending some time with us.
[02:23:58.097 --> 02:24:00.078]  Well, Alex, it's a pleasure to be on with you.
[02:24:00.278 --> 02:24:01.998]  You know I do some radio as well.
[02:24:02.038 --> 02:24:09.041]  I don't have the following of a reputation that the great Alex Jones has, but it's an absolute delight to be on with you.
[02:24:09.101 --> 02:24:19.064]  And I discovered recently that we have a lot of mutual friends who share the view that you so nicely articulated that the government is the enemy.
[02:24:19.853 --> 02:24:27.140]  And as Ronald Reagan once said, the nine most dangerous words in the English language are, I'm from the government, I'm here to help you.
[02:24:27.480 --> 02:24:32.965]  Well, I'll tell you, the last two days I've read three or four chapters, I've scanned through a lot of it.
[02:24:32.985 --> 02:24:36.288]  You know how it is, it's midnight, you've got to get to sleep, but you want to finish reading it.
[02:24:36.328 --> 02:24:37.729]  But it's a powerful book.
[02:24:37.989 --> 02:24:40.792]  Again, I love a book that starts with Thomas Jefferson quotes.
[02:24:40.812 --> 02:24:42.873]  Tell us why you wrote this book.
[02:24:42.893 --> 02:24:44.795]  That's a great question, I appreciate it, Alex.
[02:24:44.895 --> 02:24:45.696]  I wrote the book
[02:24:46.280 --> 02:25:03.996]  Because we are in an era where the federal government controls so many aspects of our lives, from where you can build your house, to how big your toilet bowls are, to the number of lobsters you can catch in the ocean, to the amount of sugar you can put in ketchup and still call it ketchup.
[02:25:04.496 --> 02:25:10.702]  People need to know that the vast majority of authority that the federal government has
[02:25:11.224 --> 02:25:14.967]  It's simply seized from the states and from individuals.
[02:25:15.127 --> 02:25:18.529]  It is nowhere countenanced in the Constitution.
[02:25:18.949 --> 02:25:31.677]  The federal government, starting with Abraham Lincoln, pursuing up to FDR, and continuing on to LBJ and George W. Bush, and I've just named the four greatest violators of the Constitution.
[02:25:31.717 --> 02:25:32.958]  There were many, many others.
[02:25:32.978 --> 02:25:35.320]  It'd be difficult to find a president who didn't.
[02:25:36.060 --> 02:25:38.922]  Even my beloved Jefferson, but we can talk about that later.
[02:25:39.298 --> 02:25:54.981]  But those four presidents, in leaps and bounds, destroyed individual initiative, destroyed individual liberty, destroyed the rights of the states, and created an enormous bureaucratic monstrosity in Washington, D.C.
[02:25:55.341 --> 02:26:00.182]  that exists primarily only to provide jobs and power for itself.
[02:26:00.622 --> 02:26:03.263]  And now the parasite is killing the Golden Goose.
[02:26:03.703 --> 02:26:07.544]  It has grown to be bigger than even its host.
[02:26:08.763 --> 02:26:16.515]  Well, it is so big and so out of control, there's probably not a single person on the planet who's read the tax code.
[02:26:17.016 --> 02:26:18.459]  It's 40,000 pages long.
[02:26:21.468 --> 02:26:26.470]  There probably is not a single accountant or law professor who's read the entire code.
[02:26:26.490 --> 02:26:27.730]  Everybody reads it somewhere.
[02:26:27.750 --> 02:26:29.711]  Money Magazine, what, about 10 years ago?
[02:26:29.771 --> 02:26:32.972]  They went to 15 different top tax firms and they all gave different answers?
[02:26:33.312 --> 02:26:34.032]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:26:34.052 --> 02:26:49.937]  Look, when I was doing research for this book, The Constitution in Exile, and for its predecessor, Constitutional Chaos, and when I was doing research for the speech that your friend made some kind comments about, my research was on the Patriot Act, I discovered
[02:26:50.768 --> 02:26:57.492]  That when the Patriot Act was voted on in the House of Representatives, no one in the House had a copy of it to read.
[02:26:58.053 --> 02:26:59.914]  And I thought, well, gee, that's really peculiar.
[02:26:59.934 --> 02:27:03.076]  I mean, here you have an act that tinkers with the Constitution.
[02:27:03.196 --> 02:27:04.037]  Oh yeah, Ron Hall!
[02:27:04.057 --> 02:27:04.497]  Ron Hall!
[02:27:04.577 --> 02:27:06.858]  That's not naming a post office.
[02:27:07.219 --> 02:27:10.281]  This is altering the Constitution, and these guys haven't read it.
[02:27:10.661 --> 02:27:20.147]  Then I found out that in doing more and more research, it's very common for members of Congress not to read the laws that they enact, but simply to rely on summaries of it
[02:27:20.583 --> 02:27:21.804]  We're on the march.
[02:27:21.844 --> 02:27:23.104]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:23.124 --> 02:27:25.565]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:30:48.435 --> 02:30:57.381]  The book opens with, when the people fear the government, there is tyranny.
[02:30:58.302 --> 02:31:01.624]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[02:31:03.526 --> 02:31:11.111]  And we look at what this country has turned into today, Judge Andrew P. Napolitano, Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst,
[02:31:12.347 --> 02:31:22.277]  The Constitution in Exile, I mean, this is a honest book, and from a high-powered authority on constitutional law, about how basically the Constitution isn't in tatters.
[02:31:22.317 --> 02:31:26.221]  It was flushed down the tubes a long time ago, but we can get it back.
[02:31:26.281 --> 02:31:28.483]  It beats and lives in our heart.
[02:31:30.019 --> 02:31:31.720]  Judge, I want to continue with the Patriot Act.
[02:31:32.120 --> 02:31:35.463]  There's people trying to push for laws like Read the Bills Act, make them read them.
[02:31:35.883 --> 02:31:42.068]  The foreign lobbyists in many cases now, and they're the majority of the lobbyists, are there writing the laws.
[02:31:42.348 --> 02:31:47.632]  Ron Paul told us that 30 minutes before they passed the Patriot Act, October 27, 2001, they issued it.
[02:31:50.828 --> 02:31:53.268]  And it was 400 plus pages long, by the way, boys and girls.
[02:31:53.949 --> 02:31:55.289]  And that, by the way, that was committee.
[02:31:55.409 --> 02:31:57.169]  Chairman were given it 30 minutes before.
[02:31:57.189 --> 02:32:03.970]  He said about 20 minutes before the vote, he was, and then he had his people waiting, he had to stay up late at night.
[02:32:04.430 --> 02:32:10.011]  And then they announced it, they ran in, they gave it to him, he had 20 minutes, and then he just went out and voted against it.
[02:32:10.731 --> 02:32:12.652]  Is that what you're talking about, Judge Napolitano?
[02:32:13.232 --> 02:32:15.612]  Alex, even, and let me say a word about Ron Paul.
[02:32:16.172 --> 02:32:19.413]  He's the finest member of Congress in modern times.
[02:32:20.080 --> 02:32:33.244]  And one of the few, and he fortunately has about two dozen who agree with him, unfortunately the number is so small, one of the few who understands the true role of the federal government in the Founding Fathers scheme in the Constitution.
[02:32:33.564 --> 02:32:40.446]  Ron is 100% correct, and even if he were a speed reader, you can't read the 400 pages like you'd read a novel.
[02:32:40.959 --> 02:32:44.201]  Because in order to read it, and I've read it, but it took me several days to do so.
[02:32:44.221 --> 02:32:45.262]  You've got to go look up the U.S.
[02:32:45.302 --> 02:32:45.542]  Code.
[02:32:46.002 --> 02:32:46.622]  Precisely.
[02:32:46.803 --> 02:32:50.005]  It refers you to various sections of the U.S.
[02:32:50.065 --> 02:32:56.909]  Code, and it says things like, change AND to OR, change 15 to 20, change the comma to the semicolon.
[02:32:56.949 --> 02:33:04.493]  So you've got to sort of re-handwrite that out or throw it up on your laptop screen, and then understand what the new sentence means.
[02:33:04.793 --> 02:33:07.155]  But the bottom line of the Patriot Act is,
[02:33:07.879 --> 02:33:13.423]  It allows federal agents to write their own search warrants.
[02:33:13.964 --> 02:33:23.651]  They no longer have to go to a judge if they want your financial information, if they want information from your doctor, if they want information about you from your lawyer.
[02:33:23.691 --> 02:33:26.373]  And they're using it in non-terror related cases?
[02:33:26.733 --> 02:33:27.434]  Absolutely.
[02:33:27.694 --> 02:33:30.076]  Ask me how many convictions
[02:33:30.566 --> 02:33:38.148]  The federal government has obtained from a jury in a federal court on the basis of information obtained under the Patriot Act.
[02:33:38.228 --> 02:33:39.568]  It's a very easy answer.
[02:33:40.068 --> 02:33:40.588]  Zero.
[02:33:41.209 --> 02:33:43.409]  No terrorist convictions obtained.
[02:33:43.709 --> 02:33:51.371]  They've gotten convictions for distribution of pornography, for political corruption, for distribution of judges, for distribution of drugs.
[02:33:51.471 --> 02:34:00.093]  I'm not necessarily in favor of those acts, but the promise that Attorney General John Ashcroft made, we need this so badly we can't
[02:34:00.669 --> 02:34:09.294]  Give you time to read it because we have to go after the terrorists and we'll only use it for terrorism as a promise that wasn't even worth the breath that he spoke when he articulated it.
[02:34:09.314 --> 02:34:10.934]  Well, we don't have a Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:34:10.974 --> 02:34:11.915]  We don't have a country.
[02:34:12.175 --> 02:34:12.695]  No, we don't.
[02:34:13.076 --> 02:34:17.578]  And anybody that voted for the Patriot Act, even a so-called conservative Republican,
[02:34:18.178 --> 02:34:18.719]  It's inherent.
[02:34:18.739 --> 02:34:19.719]  It's organic.
[02:34:19.739 --> 02:34:20.520]  I mean... Correct.
[02:34:20.580 --> 02:34:24.403]  What I'm likened it to is, 200 years ago, a slave owner had a right to beat a slave to death.
[02:34:40.368 --> 02:34:44.834]  But, inherently, in just natural law, that slave wasn't a slave.
[02:34:45.134 --> 02:34:48.739]  He had a right to grab that axe handle away and beat his master's brains out.
[02:34:49.079 --> 02:34:49.680]  Absolutely.
[02:34:50.261 --> 02:34:50.701]  Absolutely.
[02:34:50.741 --> 02:34:51.943]  Now, no one told him that.
[02:34:52.403 --> 02:34:53.565]  And no one taught him that.
[02:34:53.885 --> 02:34:59.192]  But because slavery is in the category of behavior that is always wrong.
[02:34:59.762 --> 02:35:02.883]  One has the right to use violence against behavior.
[02:35:03.304 --> 02:35:04.684]  That is always wrong.
[02:35:05.104 --> 02:35:13.308]  We have a right to speak freely, to think freely, to worship freely, to travel, to be free from unwanted government intrusion.
[02:35:13.628 --> 02:35:15.389]  Not because the Constitution grants it.
[02:35:15.409 --> 02:35:16.770]  The Constitution doesn't grant it.
[02:35:17.110 --> 02:35:20.892]  The Constitution just says to the government, keep your hands off it.
[02:35:21.272 --> 02:35:23.913]  So anybody who would vote for the Patriot Act,
[02:35:24.392 --> 02:35:28.215]  doesn't understand that they don't even have the right or the power to interfere with those rights.
[02:35:28.235 --> 02:35:29.436]  Well, here's an example.
[02:35:29.456 --> 02:35:30.197]  Here's an example.
[02:35:30.217 --> 02:35:30.838]  Here's an example.
[02:35:30.878 --> 02:35:31.318]  Here's an example.

[02:35:32.219 --> 02:35:32.579]  Here's an example.
[02:35:32.599 --> 02:35:32.939]  Here's an example.
[02:35:32.959 --> 02:35:33.300]  Here's an example.

[02:35:33.700 --> 02:35:34.100]  Here's an example.
[02:35:34.120 --> 02:35:34.461]  Here's an example.
[02:35:34.501 --> 02:35:34.921]  Here's an example.
[02:35:34.941 --> 02:35:35.301]  Here's an example.
[02:35:35.321 --> 02:35:35.742]  Here's an example.
[02:35:35.802 --> 02:35:36.262]  Here's an example.
[02:35:36.282 --> 02:35:36.883]  Here's an example.
[02:35:36.943 --> 02:35:37.623]  Here's an example.
[02:35:37.643 --> 02:35:38.344]  Here's an example.
[02:35:38.384 --> 02:35:39.004]  Here's an example.
[02:35:39.024 --> 02:35:39.625]  Here's an example.
[02:35:39.645 --> 02:35:40.205]  Here's an example.
[02:35:40.226 --> 02:35:40.826]  Here's an example.
[02:35:40.846 --> 02:35:41.306]  Here's an example.
[02:35:41.386 --> 02:35:42.107]  Here's an example.
[02:35:42.127 --> 02:35:42.467]  Here's an example.
[02:35:42.487 --> 02:35:42.828]  Here's an example.
[02:35:42.848 --> 02:35:43.208]  Here's an example.
[02:35:43.228 --> 02:35:43.648]  Here's an example.
[02:35:43.668 --> 02:35:44.049]  Here's an example.
[02:35:44.069 --> 02:35:44.449]  Here's an example.
[02:35:44.469 --> 02:35:44.809]  Here's an example.
[02:35:44.849 --> 02:35:45.590]  Here's an example.
[02:35:45.610 --> 02:35:46.030]  Here's an example.
[02:35:46.050 --> 02:35:46.411]  Here's an example.
[02:35:46.431 --> 02:35:46.811]  Here's an example.
[02:35:46.831 --> 02:35:47.191]  Here's an example.
[02:35:47.231 --> 02:35:47.712]  Here's an example.
[02:35:47.732 --> 02:35:48.192]  Here's an example.
[02:35:48.212 --> 02:35:48.713]  Here's an example.
[02:35:48.733 --> 02:35:49.053]  Here's
[02:35:49.353 --> 02:35:56.297]  And I say, you don't have probable cause, and he says, he pulls out a letter, hands it to me, and says, we have a change in state police policy.
[02:35:56.737 --> 02:35:59.418]  So that's not even a law, now they just say they have policy.
[02:35:59.639 --> 02:36:03.160]  What about bureaucracies just running around, making it up as they go?
[02:36:03.561 --> 02:36:13.786]  There are two attributes that everybody that works for the government shares, whether they're a janitor or a president, whether they're a school teacher or the governor, and everything in between.
[02:36:14.406 --> 02:36:17.628]  One is, they love power, and they love to use it.
[02:36:18.203 --> 02:36:20.064]  The other is, they're lazy.
[02:36:20.084 --> 02:36:27.226]  And they're prepared to cut any corners, even the corners of the Constitution itself, in order to make their job easier.
[02:36:27.306 --> 02:36:28.726]  There is no policy.
[02:36:29.046 --> 02:36:36.949]  There is no person in the country who has the authority to issue a policy that allows them to go into your briefcase or into the trunk of your car.
[02:36:37.389 --> 02:36:47.912]  They have to take you in, present a probable cause to a judge, which they don't have, persuade the judge that it's more likely than not that in your briefcase or in the trunk of your car is evidence of a crime.
[02:36:48.331 --> 02:36:50.553]  We don't have fishing expeditions in this country.
[02:36:50.773 --> 02:36:54.497]  Whether there's policy for it or not, the Constitution prohibits it.
[02:36:54.837 --> 02:36:58.000]  We fought a revolution because the British soldiers used to do that to us.
[02:36:58.140 --> 02:36:58.661]  Exactly.
[02:36:58.721 --> 02:37:07.589]  Now, expanding on that, Judge Napolitano, with the new book, The Constitution in Exile, how the federal government has seized power and is rewriting the supreme law of the land.
[02:37:08.670 --> 02:37:09.671]  Expanding out.
[02:37:09.751 --> 02:37:10.512]  Family courts.
[02:37:10.872 --> 02:37:13.455]  Now, we've got a judge, Gene Muir, right here in Austin, Texas.
[02:37:14.779 --> 02:37:27.513]  Who, and I've been in the courts, I've seen it, screams at fathers and mothers and orders them to sign an agreement to adjudicate, to sign over the child's rights to be on probation when the child's literally just been true in a couple days.
[02:37:28.391 --> 02:37:34.776]  And the father says no, and she threatens to arrest him for contempt, and she's compelling him to sign a form.
[02:37:35.057 --> 02:37:36.218]  It's contract fraud.
[02:37:36.238 --> 02:37:44.785]  So what do we do about these judges that think that they're God and think that they're an imperial court?
[02:37:45.025 --> 02:37:46.846]  Well, there's a couple things that you can do.
[02:37:47.387 --> 02:37:50.309]  One is the bright light of the media, which of course you're doing.
[02:37:51.030 --> 02:37:54.593]  In Texas, the judges are elected, so she could be voted out of office.
[02:37:55.231 --> 02:38:02.936]  Or you can appeal it to an appellate court, but no judge has the right to force you to sign anything against your will, especially if there's not been a trial.
[02:38:03.236 --> 02:38:12.182]  If she's held a trial, and a jury has decided that the child is truant, or the parents can no longer take care of the child, that's a different story.
[02:38:12.502 --> 02:38:19.066]  But for her to say, hey, it's an easy way for me to get rid of this case, is to put this kid in probation, I'm going to order you to consent to it,
[02:38:19.446 --> 02:38:20.527]  She doesn't have the right to do it.
[02:38:20.727 --> 02:38:25.171]  That's like her asking you to consent to give up your First Amendment freedoms.
[02:38:25.611 --> 02:38:28.273]  No judge has the power to compel you to do that.
[02:38:28.553 --> 02:38:34.038]  It would take a very courageous person to resist her, but I would argue that that's what should be done.
[02:38:34.618 --> 02:38:39.822]  If you can get the old black and white footage of what criminal trials were like in Nazi Germany, that's what you'll see.
[02:38:39.882 --> 02:38:41.203]  Many of the judges were maniacal.
[02:38:57.040 --> 02:39:00.262]  And screamed and yelled at defendants and got them to give up their rights.
[02:39:00.302 --> 02:39:01.822]  There were very, very few fair trials.
[02:39:01.862 --> 02:39:03.303]  They weren't interested in fair trials.
[02:39:03.763 --> 02:39:08.525]  Even with Nazis on the jury, they were worried that defendants might get acquitted.
[02:39:08.865 --> 02:39:12.467]  So their goal was to browbeat defendants into some kind of a submission in the courtroom.
[02:39:12.487 --> 02:39:14.228]  That's what it sounds like it's happening in Texas.
[02:39:14.728 --> 02:39:18.770]  Texas has the most corrupt judicial system in the country.
[02:39:18.850 --> 02:39:20.090]  I don't mean the judges are being bribed.
[02:39:20.110 --> 02:39:21.171]  That's not what I mean by corrupt.
[02:39:21.584 --> 02:39:34.275]  By corrupt I mean decisions based on other than the merits of the case and judges doing things in order to further their careers in the judiciary rather than doing what's right in the courtroom.
[02:39:34.696 --> 02:39:47.687]  Until you get a system where politics is out of the judiciary, where this judge is more interested in pleasing the editorial writers or the voters who would advance her to a higher court, you're never going to have a pure system of justice.
[02:39:48.027 --> 02:39:52.670]  What would you do if you saw, and I know you know judges like this, what do you do when you see them at a cocktail party or an event?
[02:39:52.690 --> 02:39:55.571]  I mean, do you go, shame on you, or do you try to talk sense into them?
[02:39:55.591 --> 02:39:59.533]  Well, when I see a judge at a cocktail party or an event, I do.
[02:40:00.014 --> 02:40:01.555]  But I'm in a little bit of a different position.
[02:40:01.575 --> 02:40:07.978]  I mean, I was a life tenure judge in New Jersey, and now I'm on television two or three times a day, and everybody calls me, your honor.
[02:40:07.998 --> 02:40:14.962]  It's difficult for your ordinary lawyer to do that, but I'm in a position where I can get away with it, and frequently I do take advantage of that.
[02:40:17.776 --> 02:40:18.817]  Let's say they're listening right now.
[02:40:18.857 --> 02:40:21.599]  What do you say to them about not destroying America?
[02:40:22.280 --> 02:40:30.645]  I remind them that they are the last line of defense that we have between tyranny and freedom.
[02:40:31.165 --> 02:40:37.750]  Because if the President thinks that he can shine into law bills that would take away our freedoms,
[02:40:38.197 --> 02:40:58.875]  And if the Congress thinks that it can enact laws that would gut the Constitution, it is only my former colleagues in black robes who would say to the President and say to the Congress or say to the Legislature or the Governor of Texas, and I'm not necessarily picking on them, I'm just using this for hypothetical, the Constitution is supreme
[02:40:59.395 --> 02:41:00.176]  And you are not.
[02:41:00.556 --> 02:41:03.397]  It takes great courage to be a judge and do the right thing.
[02:41:03.697 --> 02:41:07.319]  And you must remember, your oath is not to the government.
[02:41:07.639 --> 02:41:09.740]  Your oath is to the Constitution.
[02:41:10.161 --> 02:41:13.602]  And you are the last line of defense in a civilized society.
[02:41:13.622 --> 02:41:19.125]  Well, I had a nice retired FBI agent on Admiral Kimmel's grandson talking about Pearl Harbor last hour.
[02:41:19.585 --> 02:41:22.026]  What they did to Admiral Kimmel, they shouldn't have done to a dog.
[02:41:22.407 --> 02:41:24.988]  I didn't hear what the grandson said, but I'm sure I'll agree with him.
[02:41:25.892 --> 02:41:27.453]  Well, yeah, I mean, I certainly agree with him, too.
[02:41:27.493 --> 02:41:32.635]  My point is, in his bio, it says, you know, I served the government.
[02:41:34.376 --> 02:41:36.236]  No, no, you were serving the American people.
[02:41:36.296 --> 02:41:42.319]  But why do we call elected representatives officials, authorities?
[02:41:42.339 --> 02:41:46.020]  I mean, isn't that part of also this tyrannizing of the country?
[02:41:46.560 --> 02:41:50.522]  Part of the tyrannizing of the country is the things that Ron Paul was talking about.
[02:41:50.982 --> 02:41:55.326]  When the Congress enacts a statute, they can't find a place in the Constitution where it's authorized.
[02:41:55.586 --> 02:41:57.107]  They don't have the time to read it.
[02:41:57.467 --> 02:42:04.353]  They assume that they are immune from what they do and what they say and that there's no consequences for what they do and say.
[02:42:04.873 --> 02:42:17.362]  We need to return to a system of government of citizen legislators, where the legislature meets maybe one or two months a year, where people rotate in and out, where there is no permanent class of governor.
[02:42:17.402 --> 02:42:19.163]  You're talking about a Jeffersonian system?
[02:42:19.483 --> 02:42:20.104]  Absolutely.
[02:42:20.404 --> 02:42:20.744]  Absolutely.
[02:42:20.764 --> 02:42:22.846]  Because absent the Jeffersonian system,
[02:42:23.506 --> 02:42:29.848]  Human liberty will decrease and the power of the state will increase and only a revolution can stop that.
[02:42:29.908 --> 02:42:31.029]  And isn't it exponential?
[02:42:31.089 --> 02:42:40.592]  I mean, government and big systems has a gravitational well where it's so large it will always expand until there is a revolution.
[02:42:40.612 --> 02:42:42.753]  Do you think we've passed that point of no return?
[02:42:43.193 --> 02:42:45.214]  I don't think we've passed the point of no return.
[02:42:45.614 --> 02:42:50.076]  It would take a lot of people who think like you and Ron Paul and a lot of your listeners and I
[02:42:50.496 --> 02:42:55.197]  But there are some practical things that can be done, and I talk about them in the Constitution in Exile.
[02:42:55.557 --> 02:43:00.678]  We can get rid of the 16th Amendment, which would starve the government to death, because that's what allows them to tax income.
[02:43:01.058 --> 02:43:10.380]  We can get rid of the 17th Amendment, which would require that state legislatures elect senators rather than people, so they're there in the best interest of the state.
[02:43:10.620 --> 02:43:17.562]  We can enact term limits, so that nobody can be in the government for more than one or two terms, and we can remind everybody
[02:43:18.075 --> 02:43:24.477]  But the 10th Amendment says that that which has not been given to the feds is reserved for the states.
[02:43:24.877 --> 02:43:27.437]  We should put the word expressly given to the feds.
[02:43:27.718 --> 02:43:29.778]  Just a couple of simple changes and we've got it done.
[02:43:30.158 --> 02:43:31.759]  Well the level of corruption and fraud.
[02:43:31.799 --> 02:43:32.579]  Here's another example.
[02:43:32.599 --> 02:43:36.660]  I'm going to talk about Military Commissions Act and the Defense Authorization Act and FEMA camps.
[02:43:37.381 --> 02:43:44.706]  Another example of lawlessness, through the PR firms, every year before school, they announce, it's the law, you've got to take vaccines or you'll be arrested.
[02:43:45.066 --> 02:43:46.147]  Now, there is no law.
[02:43:46.487 --> 02:43:51.751]  What there is, is a waiver that they would like for you to sign as a, quote, policy.
[02:43:51.791 --> 02:43:59.377]  What they do is, they then expel you, then use the truancy law, which they triggered by expelling you, to then arrest the pupil.
[02:43:59.757 --> 02:44:04.260]  I mean, what would you call that bizarre color of law, gyration of
[02:44:05.141 --> 02:44:07.723]  I would call that constitutional chaos.
[02:44:07.803 --> 02:44:16.130]  I would call that the government breaking Law A so that they can force you to obey a non-Law B. I mean, that's not even breaking the law in order to enforce it.
[02:44:16.170 --> 02:44:21.074]  That's breaking the law in order to compel behavior which they don't have the authority to compel.
[02:44:21.594 --> 02:44:26.358]  One of my big beefs, and my new book which will be out this summer is called A Nation of Sheep.
[02:44:27.006 --> 02:44:31.549]  It's the unwillingness of people to challenge the government.
[02:44:31.790 --> 02:44:34.071]  Why do we assume that the government is right?
[02:44:34.091 --> 02:44:36.653]  The government is almost always wrong!
[02:44:36.893 --> 02:44:38.875]  And the American people need to understand that!
[02:44:39.095 --> 02:44:41.757]  The burden of proof should be on the government to prove that it's right!
[02:44:42.137 --> 02:44:45.179]  Not on the citizens that they abuse to prove that it's wrong.
[02:44:45.199 --> 02:44:45.759]  Well, I agree.
[02:44:45.799 --> 02:44:49.021]  This is all absolute wisdom, constitutional, right down the line.
[02:44:49.041 --> 02:44:54.564]  You know, my producer, Kevin Smith, went up to me on Fox News a few weeks ago because I couldn't make it because of family engagements.
[02:44:54.925 --> 02:44:58.727]  And he was debating this very nice firefighter on the show in Mankow.
[02:44:59.547 --> 02:45:11.512]  And the firefighter, Kevin said, the firefighter said, well you're saying the government's bad, you know, that destroys America, you know, the government is America, and it's good, and now you're hurting it.
[02:45:11.892 --> 02:45:24.037]  And Kevin said, no, no, no, the Founding Fathers said, you know, the government's the people, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, you shouldn't just do whatever the government says, you shouldn't trust it, you should never trust it, and they both looked at him like he had 14 heads, and they went,
[02:45:24.557 --> 02:45:26.878]  You're saying the government isn't good?
[02:45:27.098 --> 02:45:28.779]  You're saying we shouldn't do whatever it says?
[02:45:28.999 --> 02:45:35.522]  I mean, how did Americans get to the point where what was common sense 50 years ago is out the window?
[02:45:37.161 --> 02:45:47.787]  The monster called public education, the monster called teachers unions, we've all been fed since 99% of us went to public schools, grammar and high school, we've all been fed the same nonsense.
[02:45:48.127 --> 02:45:58.033]  Why does everybody believe that the biggest criminal in the history of the United States of America, who murdered more than 600,000 of his fellow Americans, Abraham Lincoln, is the greatest president in history?
[02:45:58.413 --> 02:46:00.935]  Because the teachers unions and public education
[02:46:01.315 --> 02:46:05.859]  Have brainwashed us into believing that this kind of big government is a good thing.
[02:46:06.259 --> 02:46:08.781]  It's what virtually brought us to our knees.
[02:46:08.921 --> 02:46:17.788]  Sure, saying something like they destroyed the Republic, he destroyed states' rights, the Tenth Amendment, and what happened after they killed him was even worse during Reconstruction.
[02:46:17.828 --> 02:46:25.914]  Of course, he did it to, quote, preserve the Union, but you're right, he arrested legislators, newspaper editors in the North, and he said it had nothing to do with black slaves.
[02:46:25.934 --> 02:46:27.075]  He said that in speeches.
[02:46:27.675 --> 02:46:35.577]  He was actually in favor of what would have been the 13th Amendment to the United States, which would have prohibited the federal government from interfering with slavery.
[02:46:35.977 --> 02:46:39.178]  He was in favor of anything that would have preserved his own power.
[02:46:39.458 --> 02:46:47.139]  He was no more interested in eradicating slavery than he was jumping over the moon, unless it suited his contemporary political needs.
[02:46:47.539 --> 02:46:54.621]  There came a time in the Civil War when he and the Cabinet decided, aha, if we free the slaves now, there'll be too much of a burden on the South and we'll win this war.
[02:46:55.512 --> 02:46:59.215]  And then he formed armies and sent himself, and it was not retribution.
[02:46:59.275 --> 02:47:00.716]  It was insane.
[02:47:01.837 --> 02:47:07.761]  Well, I tell you, this has been an unbelievable interview, and I want to get you back on for a full hour in the near future.
[02:47:08.181 --> 02:47:18.189]  It's the Constitution in Exile, Judge Andrew P. Napolitano, and you can also go to his website and find out more about his radio show he does nationally.
[02:47:18.589 --> 02:47:21.851]  It's JudgeNap.com, JudgeNAP.com.
[02:47:22.152 --> 02:47:23.693]  In closing, in the last minute and a half,
[02:47:24.293 --> 02:47:26.715]  The Military Commissions Act does affect citizens.
[02:47:26.755 --> 02:47:27.235]  I've read it.
[02:47:27.296 --> 02:47:28.536]  The law scholars have looked at it.
[02:47:28.957 --> 02:47:30.398]  What they do is they change the definition.
[02:47:30.418 --> 02:47:31.839]  They say, well, you're no longer American.
[02:47:32.099 --> 02:47:34.081]  We say now you're an enemy combatant.
[02:47:34.101 --> 02:47:36.483]  And then they play the trick of saying, now you're a foreigner.
[02:47:37.303 --> 02:47:44.389]  And then we also have the Defense Authorization Act, which makes Bush total dictator over the states in time of crises or insurrection.
[02:47:44.589 --> 02:47:45.370]  Can you comment on that?
[02:47:45.750 --> 02:47:46.030]  Sure.
[02:47:46.510 --> 02:47:49.613]  And there are many, many defects in that statute, but I'll give you one of the worst.
[02:47:50.180 --> 02:47:55.325]  If you were tried before a jury and found not guilty, you'd expect to be set free.
[02:47:56.066 --> 02:48:03.773]  The Military Commission Act of 2006 allows George Bush to lock you up and keep you in jail even after you've been acquitted.
[02:48:04.585 --> 02:48:14.609]  Even Hitler and Stalin and Mao, the great monsters of the 20th century, never claimed that power, and the Congress just gave it to whoever is the President.
[02:48:14.850 --> 02:48:20.232]  It's one of the most outrageous violations of human liberty ever enacted, and the public isn't even aware of it.
[02:48:20.272 --> 02:48:22.513]  What about the bizarre statement in the bill saying,
[02:48:23.257 --> 02:48:25.860]  Judges can't question its rulings.
[02:48:26.521 --> 02:48:31.327]  I believe that that's going to be overturned, hard to believe, by a Democratic Congress.
[02:48:31.888 --> 02:48:34.311]  You know, I've got one more short little segment.
[02:48:34.331 --> 02:48:36.573]  Stay for a three minute break and then one minute on the other side.
[02:48:36.874 --> 02:48:39.216]  I want to hear more about that because that was in the news today.
[02:48:39.537 --> 02:48:40.298]  Stay with us, folks.
[02:48:47.097 --> 02:48:50.278]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:50.618 --> 02:48:52.558]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:52.918 --> 02:49:00.580]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:01.260 --> 02:49:08.301]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:08.702 --> 02:49:15.563]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:49:16.098 --> 02:49:20.139]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:20.439 --> 02:49:23.919]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:24.400 --> 02:49:26.300]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:26.660 --> 02:49:30.581]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:44.693 --> 02:49:45.654]  Good morning, honey.
[02:49:46.014 --> 02:49:52.018]  Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation!
[02:49:52.298 --> 02:49:52.899]  Yeah.
[02:49:53.279 --> 02:49:54.720]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[02:49:55.060 --> 02:49:58.463]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel berkey system.
[02:49:58.943 --> 02:50:00.424]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[02:50:00.864 --> 02:50:02.585]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[02:50:02.966 --> 02:50:04.727]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[02:50:06.260 --> 02:50:08.482]  I brought our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[02:50:08.722 --> 02:50:09.042]  What?
[02:50:09.482 --> 02:50:19.969]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[02:50:20.250 --> 02:50:25.093]  You know, this is a terrific cabin, and wow, have you noticed the beautiful weather?

[02:51:49.961 --> 02:51:52.522]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[02:51:52.562 --> 02:51:54.882]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245.
[02:51:54.962 --> 02:51:58.243]  Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip.
[02:51:58.263 --> 02:52:01.683]  And everybody knew he didn't give no lift to Big John.
[02:52:03.364 --> 02:52:05.264]  Big John.
[02:52:06.144 --> 02:52:08.425]  Big John.
[02:52:08.965 --> 02:52:10.605]  Big Bab John.
[02:52:11.865 --> 02:52:12.906]  Big John.
[02:52:15.032 --> 02:52:43.648]  Nobody seemed to know where John called home He just drifted into town and stayed all alone Didn't say much, kinda quiet and shy But he spoke it all, he just said hi, Big John Somebody said he came from New Orleans Where he got in a fight over a Cajun queen And a crashing blow from a huge right hand Sent a Louisiana fella to the promised land, Big John Welcome back, glad that you've joined us, the show is almost over
[02:52:44.933 --> 02:52:47.235]  I was talking to Judge Napolitano about Judge Jean Meary.
[02:52:47.255 --> 02:52:50.517]  Couldn't believe they named a huge building after her while she's in office.
[02:52:51.078 --> 02:52:52.319]  He wants information on her.
[02:52:52.359 --> 02:52:55.741]  People all over Central Texas, he's talking about doing a piece on her.
[02:52:55.801 --> 02:53:04.148]  Go to his website, JudgeNap.com, or just type in Judge Napolitano into a search engine, get his website, and you can contact him, send him emails.
[02:53:04.508 --> 02:53:05.469]  Send all the dirt on her.
[02:53:06.309 --> 02:53:07.930]  And there's so much, it'll make your head spin.
[02:53:08.870 --> 02:53:10.972]  That's great, because they do pieces on those.
[02:53:11.012 --> 02:53:12.873]  We're really honored to have him with us.
[02:53:12.933 --> 02:53:15.594]  He does do a syndicated radio program on the weekends.
[02:53:15.654 --> 02:53:17.555]  It's called Brian and the Judge.
[02:53:17.895 --> 02:53:18.876]  More details on his website.
[02:53:19.096 --> 02:53:22.478]  In closing, that Military Commissions Act, yeah, it's full of nightmares.
[02:53:22.918 --> 02:53:24.339]  It changes the definition of torture.
[02:53:24.939 --> 02:53:26.500]  You think we've got a good chance of overturning that?
[02:53:27.661 --> 02:53:29.402]  I think we have a good chance of overturning it.
[02:53:29.422 --> 02:53:35.625]  I never thought that the Democrats would be our salvation of liberty, but so many of them got so personally irked by the way
[02:53:36.537 --> 02:53:43.983]  The Bush administration treated the Congress as if it were a mere constitutional nuisance during its first six years, but now that they control it.
[02:53:44.343 --> 02:54:00.395]  For example, Senator Arlen Specter, a liberal Republican, but the present chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Pat Leahy, a liberal Democrat, but the soon-to-be chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, have together introduced legislation to restore habeas corpus rights
[02:54:00.908 --> 02:54:04.973]  To those who we arrest in foreign lands and sent to Guantanamo Bay.
[02:54:05.173 --> 02:54:07.435]  And that is the genius of separation of powers.
[02:54:07.515 --> 02:54:15.464]  Even though power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely and centralized power is a threat, the different branches will fight over the power and that will keep a man on a white horse.
[02:54:15.805 --> 02:54:17.407]  At least that's the theory from taking over.
[02:54:17.707 --> 02:54:19.209]  Judge, we'll talk to you again soon.
[02:54:19.229 --> 02:54:19.929]  Thanks for coming on.
[02:54:20.130 --> 02:54:20.730]  Pleasure, Alex.
[02:54:20.790 --> 02:54:21.351]  God bless you.
[02:54:21.631 --> 02:54:22.052]  Take care.
[02:54:22.572 --> 02:54:25.695]  Alright, in closing, we are launching a new product here.
[02:54:25.715 --> 02:54:26.576]  I'm very excited about it.
[02:54:26.596 --> 02:54:30.199]  I should have spent a lot of time on it today, but too busy covering news and having guests on.
[02:54:30.860 --> 02:54:42.410]  I did research on Grundig, on Sanjian, on others, and I found for the price, and not just price, I'd pay more for this, that Kato is the best radio out there.
[02:54:42.870 --> 02:54:46.714]  And we are carrying it, and we have it lower than people right here in town are selling it for.
[02:54:47.655 --> 02:54:51.456]  We have the KA-103, top of the line, $109.
[02:54:51.496 --> 02:54:54.738]  This thing's like $140 in stores.
[02:54:54.778 --> 02:54:56.218]  Other people sell it online for $119.
[02:54:57.278 --> 02:54:57.659]  This is $109.
[02:54:58.059 --> 02:55:00.640]  Okay, we are discounting it.
[02:55:00.680 --> 02:55:01.760]  They are all discounted.
[02:55:02.220 --> 02:55:07.162]  We offer a bunch of digital tuners, and we have a crank tuner that we found to be superior.
[02:55:07.202 --> 02:55:08.642]  We just found they're the best out there.
[02:55:09.083 --> 02:55:13.404]  It's available via the safe, secure online shopping cart at InfoWars.com.
[02:55:13.704 --> 02:55:14.644]  This is a great gift.
[02:55:14.684 --> 02:55:16.005]  It has AM, FM,

[02:55:31.128 --> 02:55:32.789]  I just can't go on.
[02:55:33.389 --> 02:55:35.010]  It's got three kinds of backlight mode.
[02:55:35.768 --> 02:55:37.849]  We've got a bunch of new shortwave radios we're offering.
[02:55:38.849 --> 02:55:43.651]  For years I've wanted to carry them, but I was trying to see what the best deal was for everybody, what the best radios were.
[02:55:44.091 --> 02:55:45.152]  You've requested them.
[02:55:45.672 --> 02:55:49.634]  We got them at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:55:50.234 --> 02:55:55.316]  That's InfoWars.com on the Secure Online Safe Shopping Cart.

[02:56:00.916 --> 02:56:02.597]  They're antennas that go along with it.
