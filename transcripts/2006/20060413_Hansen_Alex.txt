[00:00:02.434 --> 00:00:03.475]  Here's a case point example.
[00:00:03.475 --> 00:00:14.644]  I know Keanu Reeves pretty good, and the press always talks about how he's stupid, he's shallow, he's not a nice guy, and then I know other people that know him and they tell the same story I tell.
[00:00:14.644 --> 00:00:28.495]  He's intelligent, he's informed, he's compassionate, he's nice to his assistants, he is very politically aware, and then by the time you read articles about him, you know, he's just a horrible idiot.
[00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:30.850]  Well, that's because he doesn't like the press.
[00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.471]  He doesn't trust the press.
[00:00:32.471 --> 00:00:33.492]  He's a private person.
[00:00:33.492 --> 00:00:42.217]  And the reason I bring Keanu Reeves up here, and that's just one of, you know, dozens and dozens and dozens of people I know, is because the stereotype you hear about him isn't true.
[00:00:42.217 --> 00:00:45.819]  And the stereotypes you hear about Charlie Sheen aren't true.
[00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:52.023]  And in almost every case what you hear in the press about famous people is not true.
[00:00:52.023 --> 00:00:53.264]  And I bring that up because
[00:00:54.483 --> 00:01:07.626]  We have seen hundreds of hit pieces written against Charlie Sheen when he went public, now what, three weeks ago today, saying he questions the official 9-11 story.
[00:01:07.626 --> 00:01:17.408]  Joining many prominent former and current members of government, economists, physicists, engineers, underwriters of the towers,
[00:01:18.607 --> 00:01:22.210]  The insurance company itself has been questioning what happened.
[00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:32.257]  So all this is going on, and then Charlie Sheen, a week into the attack on him, said, challenge me on the facts, okay?
[00:01:32.257 --> 00:01:37.761]  Don't talk about one little distorted piece of my history and my personality.
[00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:50.500]  And having a chance to get to know Mr. Sheen a little bit better in interviews and on the phone and other things, I've just learned how much even more informed he is on a wide spectrum of things.
[00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.942]  But the press will not show you the man.
[00:01:52.942 --> 00:01:54.083]  They will not show you the woman.
[00:01:54.083 --> 00:01:55.845]  They will not show you who these people really are.
[00:01:55.845 --> 00:02:04.553]  They want to minimize them because they know they have power because tens of millions of people like their performances and like the roles they play and like the things they do.
[00:02:06.816 --> 00:02:12.281]  And I've been contacted by TV reporters and some of the biggest TV stations in the country.
[00:02:12.281 --> 00:02:14.102]  I talked to CNN reporters.
[00:02:14.102 --> 00:02:15.383]  I talked to CNN producers.
[00:02:15.383 --> 00:02:17.725]  They all know about 9-11.
[00:02:17.725 --> 00:02:19.587]  But they were told to quote, kill the story.
[00:02:19.587 --> 00:02:21.748]  They wouldn't let Ed Asner come on and talk about 9-11.
[00:02:23.391 --> 00:02:24.432]  That was shut down.
[00:02:24.432 --> 00:02:26.094]  Fox News had me set up for interview.
[00:02:26.094 --> 00:02:30.959]  Their producer said, oh, that she knew all about what was happening and that a lot of them did and wanted the truth to come out.
[00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.441]  And then, boom, I said, this won't get cancelled, will it?
[00:02:33.441 --> 00:02:35.623]  And she said, oh no, no way.
[00:02:35.623 --> 00:02:35.743]  99%.
[00:02:35.743 --> 00:02:37.245]  I knew it would be cancelled.
[00:02:37.245 --> 00:02:38.526]  And then it was cancelled the next day.
[00:02:38.526 --> 00:02:39.808]  They wouldn't let me on Fox.
[00:02:39.808 --> 00:02:41.749]  Because they cannot have this debate.
[00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:43.832]  They cannot challenge us on the facts.
[00:02:43.832 --> 00:02:44.552]  Face the facts.
[00:02:44.552 --> 00:02:46.594]  They cannot face the facts of the truth of 9-11.
[00:02:47.575 --> 00:02:48.856]  And we're doing that.
[00:02:48.856 --> 00:02:51.679]  And Charlie Sheen has sent this all to another level.
[00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:54.061]  Because of his courage, he knew what would happen to him.
[00:02:54.061 --> 00:02:55.582]  He knew what he would go through.
[00:02:55.582 --> 00:02:57.284]  He did it because he loves his family.
[00:02:57.284 --> 00:02:58.745]  He can only be commended.
[00:02:58.745 --> 00:03:01.348]  Look at the fruits of his activity.
[00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:06.752]  Look at the goodness that has come of what he selflessly did.
[00:03:06.752 --> 00:03:07.893]  He is concerned.
[00:03:07.893 --> 00:03:08.974]  He is upset.
[00:03:08.974 --> 00:03:10.656]  He is researching constantly.
[00:03:11.828 --> 00:03:18.150]  He's behaving like a normal person does when they realize what's happened.
[00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:24.032]  And then he got attacked by the London Guardian, which has the biggest British newspaper there is, next to the Times of London.
[00:03:24.032 --> 00:03:26.973]  It shows that circulation is even bigger.
[00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:32.874]  Its columns are syndicated in hundreds and hundreds of Commonwealth papers, from Canada to Australia to New Zealand.
[00:03:35.513 --> 00:03:38.494]  He sent them an email and said, please, post my email.
[00:03:38.494 --> 00:03:42.916]  It's a letter to the editor, which normally they would do, with a star especially.
[00:03:42.916 --> 00:03:52.159]  And really, it's customary that if someone's written a hit piece on you, that the paper will run your response.
[00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:53.279]  Wouldn't do that.
[00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:55.240]  She wouldn't even respond to his email.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.201]  She said, well, I got his email and I'm just not going to respond to it.
[00:03:58.201 --> 00:03:59.661]  I can't tell you why.
[00:03:59.661 --> 00:04:00.662]  Because it's all facts.
[00:04:00.662 --> 00:04:01.662]  It's all documentation.
[00:04:01.662 --> 00:04:04.203]  And if the truth comes out, this criminal network's coming down.
[00:04:05.431 --> 00:04:23.999]  But here's just one reporter we're about to talk to of, I didn't count them up, it's over 20 producers, reporters, big-time people, who were told, no you can't go with this, no you can't cover this, no you can write a hit piece on Sheen, but you can't talk about his challenge.
[00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:31.623]  Well, Saturday we got his email, we vetted him, we checked him out, he's written for several major newspapers, but he writes for
[00:04:32.489 --> 00:04:37.512]  The Winnipeg Free Press that has a paper circulation of 175,000.
[00:04:37.512 --> 00:04:40.093]  So it's a moderate paper.
[00:04:40.093 --> 00:04:41.574]  It's large.
[00:04:41.574 --> 00:04:45.155]  And then of course millions of readers on its news website.
[00:04:45.155 --> 00:04:46.796]  And he sends in his weekly column.
[00:04:46.796 --> 00:04:49.898]  It's put in the paper and it's posted.
[00:04:49.898 --> 00:04:53.740]  And he sent it in Friday and it wasn't posted.
[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.901]  And then he called the editor and he's here to tell us what happened.
[00:04:56.901 --> 00:04:58.362]  And he joins us right now.
[00:04:58.362 --> 00:05:00.163]  He's Dallas Hanson.
[00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:03.592]  And we're honored to have you, Dallas.
[00:05:03.592 --> 00:05:06.354]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:05:06.354 --> 00:05:17.226]  Well, you're the only person that has the courage of the more than 20, really, reporters, and some of them big reporters from some of the biggest shows on TV, TV news, who said, yes, we know it's true.
[00:05:18.534 --> 00:05:22.617]  It runs the gamut from, yes, we know 9-11 is an inside job to, yeah, we know there's a cover-up.
[00:05:22.617 --> 00:05:22.897]  A.J.
[00:05:22.897 --> 00:05:24.818]  Hammer even said that.
[00:05:24.818 --> 00:05:26.640]  But they all say, we've been told to shut up.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.680]  We know we're getting ratings.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.081]  We know people want this.
[00:05:29.081 --> 00:05:30.622]  We know this is newsworthy.
[00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:32.063]  We've been told to shut up.
[00:05:32.063 --> 00:05:33.304]  So tell us what happened to you.
[00:05:33.304 --> 00:05:33.724]  Go through it.
[00:05:33.724 --> 00:05:35.586]  Tell us about yourself and tell us what happened.
[00:05:35.586 --> 00:05:38.628]  Well, just to clarify things, I'm not a reporter.
[00:05:38.628 --> 00:05:40.529]  I'm an opinion editorial columnist.
[00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:40.989]  Sure, sure.
[00:05:40.989 --> 00:05:42.510]  You write articles for them, sure.
[00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.271]  Right.
[00:05:43.271 --> 00:05:44.552]  For the editorial team.
[00:05:46.894 --> 00:05:53.418]  Well, what happened was when the previous editor retired, a new editor came in.
[00:05:53.418 --> 00:05:55.960]  He was formerly a columnist.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.842]  He originally came from the repertorial pool.
[00:05:58.842 --> 00:06:03.925]  And so the outgoing editor pretty much published everything I'd written.
[00:06:03.925 --> 00:06:05.827]  He was that close to pension.
[00:06:05.827 --> 00:06:08.168]  He wasn't too concerned about what he was writing.
[00:06:08.168 --> 00:06:12.411]  So one of the first pieces I sent was about these
[00:06:13.092 --> 00:06:18.855]  Mysterious, I guess, bush suicides or deaths.
[00:06:18.855 --> 00:06:22.817]  And, you know, I was told it was a conspiracy theory.
[00:06:22.817 --> 00:06:28.681]  Now, I also run a website for rapid trans advocacy here in Winnipeg.
[00:06:28.681 --> 00:06:32.723]  We've got a lot of social problems in our inner city, economic problems.
[00:06:33.815 --> 00:06:36.158]  I've put both the articles on the website.
[00:06:36.158 --> 00:06:38.721]  It's www.truwinnipeg.org.
[00:06:53.018 --> 00:06:53.199]  Sure.
[00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:09.002]  You're all hats myself.
[00:07:09.002 --> 00:07:14.246]  I write editorials, I do news reports, I make films, I do a TV show, I do a radio show.
[00:07:14.246 --> 00:07:16.768]  I mean, it runs the gamut.
[00:07:16.768 --> 00:07:19.230]  But certainly I would call you a reporter.
[00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:29.099]  But in this capacity, I think it's important to say that you were writing as an editorialist, because in that case you're always given wider latitude, but you weren't given that latitude, were you?
[00:07:30.647 --> 00:07:32.109]  Well, not in this case.
[00:07:32.109 --> 00:07:34.431]  It was kind of a satirical piece.
[00:07:34.431 --> 00:07:37.613]  It's at truewinnipeg.orgbush.html.
[00:07:37.613 --> 00:07:38.915]  You can read that one there.
[00:07:38.915 --> 00:07:43.619]  And there's also another one at nov22.html, November 20th.
[00:07:43.619 --> 00:07:45.721]  So basically you have two pieces that have been refused.
[00:07:45.721 --> 00:07:50.144]  One on the Bush death list, and then now a 9-11 Charlie Sheen case.
[00:07:50.144 --> 00:07:52.867]  Well, I thought it was kind of significant, you know, that J.H.
[00:07:52.867 --> 00:07:57.151]  Hatfield died of a cocaine overdose or whatever drug overdose in this hotel.
[00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:01.414]  I thought the Margie Schrodinger thing was kind of weird.
[00:08:01.414 --> 00:08:07.982]  The Mark Lombardi, just all these names and these weird deaths.
[00:08:07.982 --> 00:08:13.848]  And finally the Huntress Thompson thing, hearing that he was supposedly writing a book on how 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:08:15.282 --> 00:08:28.734]  By the way, I confirmed that with major Canadian journalists that write for some of the biggest papers, and on this show, two of them said, yes, he told me he was doing a book on them blowing up the towers, and that Bush did it, and then boom, he's dead.
[00:08:28.734 --> 00:08:32.698]  Yeah, I put that in my article about the Globe and Mail reporter.
[00:08:32.698 --> 00:08:34.099]  I forgot his name.
[00:08:34.099 --> 00:08:40.545]  To tell the truth, after that happened, I just pretty much figured, you know, I'm just going to stick about
[00:08:41.172 --> 00:08:47.294]  Stick to writing about rapid transit or local issues, and I'm not going to touch Bush for a while.
[00:08:47.294 --> 00:08:54.637]  But then when the Charlie Sheen thing came out, it was on CNN Showbiz Tonight, and it got a lot of coverage.
[00:08:54.637 --> 00:09:02.240]  I thought, well, here's my chance to write something more international, a bit of a... I wrote a piece about Ethiopia.
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.921]  I want to show my diversity as a writer, I guess you could say.
[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:18.926]  I wrote this piece basically because I had seen the movie JFK, and I guess I've read a lot of books about the Kennedy assassination.
[00:09:18.926 --> 00:09:32.033]  I've been to Dallas, I've been to the sixth floor, and to me, this critique of the 9-11 Commission Report and a lot of the controversy and the unanswered questions... Yeah, it's kind of like the... The Warren Commission Report.
[00:09:32.033 --> 00:09:35.515]  The 9-11 Commission Report is the new Warren Report.
[00:09:35.515 --> 00:09:36.856]  But it's even more ridiculous.
[00:09:38.727 --> 00:09:42.950]  Yeah, well, I mean, there's obviously a lot more information out there now.
[00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:52.577]  I mean, instead of just, you know, one Jim Garrison in his DA's office, we've got, you know, people all over the world shredding this thing to bits.
[00:09:52.577 --> 00:09:56.359]  Yeah, what we know is their official story is a conspiracy theory.
[00:09:56.359 --> 00:10:01.002]  So you tried to run this this weekend, and you call the editor up and say, why isn't it in the paper?
[00:10:01.002 --> 00:10:01.903]  And what did he say to you?
[00:10:01.903 --> 00:10:07.747]  Well, that's not what he... Actually, he called me, you know, maybe a couple hours after I'd submitted it, probably right after he read it.
[00:10:08.473 --> 00:10:09.994]  And said, no, we're not using this.
[00:10:09.994 --> 00:10:12.235]  It's conspiracy theory stuff.
[00:10:12.235 --> 00:10:15.477]  And I said, well, you know, I'm not saying that 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:10:15.477 --> 00:10:22.201]  I'm not, you know, he's like, yeah, but you're not saying, you know, you're not making, he's basically saying there's not even a hint of irony in this.
[00:10:22.201 --> 00:10:26.503]  You're not, you know, you're not making these people look ridiculous.
[00:10:26.503 --> 00:10:29.445]  I said, well, no, these aren't ridiculous people.
[00:10:29.445 --> 00:10:35.709]  These, I mean, we've got, you know, a former chief economist in the first Bush administration.
[00:10:37.854 --> 00:10:45.056]  You've got an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in the Reagan administration.
[00:10:45.056 --> 00:10:47.117]  I've got this BYU professor.
[00:10:47.117 --> 00:10:49.198]  I mean, these are pretty serious people.
[00:10:49.198 --> 00:10:50.339]  My editor just kind of blew it off.
[00:10:50.339 --> 00:10:52.580]  He said, oh, what's one professor?
[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:57.482]  How many people were in the Reagan cabinet anyway?
[00:10:57.482 --> 00:11:01.323]  I don't think it's a question of him being
[00:11:03.957 --> 00:11:10.069]  You know, Frater X down at the Secret Temple told him not to write anything about the 9-11 Commission.
[00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:12.233]  No, it's just he has the establishment view.
[00:11:14.394 --> 00:11:19.616]  I think he was just worried about the paper losing credibility.
[00:11:19.616 --> 00:11:29.861]  But doesn't he understand that 90% of people, 92% on average in polls I've seen, think that the Kennedy assassination was an inside job and a cover-up?
[00:11:29.861 --> 00:11:39.325]  I mean, they've got major polls out on 9-11 where between half and 80-plus percent believe that 9-11 is an inside job, depending on which poll you look at.
[00:11:39.565 --> 00:11:43.386]  Yeah, well, internet polling and stuff, I mean, it's all pretty informal polling.
[00:11:43.386 --> 00:11:48.887]  I think the Zogby poll is reliable.
[00:11:48.887 --> 00:11:50.108]  There's now another Zogby.
[00:11:50.108 --> 00:11:51.368]  Have you seen the newest Zogby?
[00:11:51.368 --> 00:11:52.448]  I haven't seen the newest Zogby.
[00:11:52.448 --> 00:11:55.269]  I know the one from 2004, which is, you know, pretty much ancient history.
[00:11:55.269 --> 00:12:02.231]  And since we're being real careful about facts here, I didn't pre-interview you, and so I was talking to you for about a minute and a half during the break,
[00:12:02.651 --> 00:12:05.833]  Like I said, I pointed out that this is a paradigm shift in
[00:12:30.476 --> 00:12:40.241]  I'm thinking in the American popular thinking, that Charlie Sheen has entered the fray, and he's saying, you know, 9-11 was a controlled demolition.
[00:12:40.241 --> 00:12:44.283]  And I think that the tide is kind of turning.
[00:12:44.283 --> 00:12:50.546]  I think that the American public is coming more to the forefront.
[00:12:50.546 --> 00:12:55.269]  I mean, just look at the Warren Report, which was once held as gospel.
[00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:58.771]  It was a sacred text that came out, you know, unimpeachable.
[00:12:58.771 --> 00:12:59.271]  Well, I mean,
[00:13:00.223 --> 00:13:03.093]  You gave it to Jim Garrison and he just shot it full of holes.
[00:13:03.735 --> 00:13:04.996]  It's a laughing stock.
[00:13:04.996 --> 00:13:07.537]  Mark Lane and so many people have done that since then.
[00:13:07.537 --> 00:13:17.302]  And I think people like yourself, Michael Rupert, Charlie Sheen, they're really starting to pierce some serious holes in the official explanation.
[00:13:17.302 --> 00:13:33.170]  Well let me just say this, and I want to get your view on this if you agree with this, Dallas Hanson, writer for the Winnipeg Free Press, joins us right now, been a writer with them since October 2004, with his weekly editorial column, and they've only refused to, one, on Bush
[00:13:34.435 --> 00:13:45.145]  If I understand you correctly, in the Bush death list, and then of course this second one you tried to run this last weekend concerning, well, I've got the article right here.
[00:13:45.145 --> 00:13:49.169]  September 11th is my generation's November 22nd.
[00:13:49.169 --> 00:13:53.954]  So I want to spend a few minutes that we've got left and go through some of the things you talk about in the article.
[00:13:53.954 --> 00:13:55.015]  But my point is this.
[00:13:55.635 --> 00:14:21.695]  The government, like Moses on Mount Sinai, hands down the official proclamation day one, or sometimes hours after a big event happens, and then forever, anyone who doubts their official story, even if their official story is proven to be a total lie and a fable, you are still called a conspiracy theorist for simply trying to do any real reporting or editorializing or analysis of what really happened.
[00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:24.357]  Any investigation itself is heresy.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:25.540]  Right.
[00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:31.485]  My opinion wasn't that 9-11 could have been an inside job, or even that we need a new investigation.
[00:14:31.485 --> 00:14:40.451]  My opinion was that the 9-11 Commission report is turning out to be something like the Warren Report, in that it's becoming kind of a cultural
[00:14:41.172 --> 00:14:42.073]  Phenomenon.
[00:14:42.073 --> 00:14:43.353]  So you were just... Do not believe it.
[00:14:43.353 --> 00:14:44.654]  Yeah, I mean, I've got the article right here.
[00:14:44.654 --> 00:14:57.400]  You were just reporting on why people question the Warren Report and how societally, how the 9-11 Commission hasn't been discredited in 20 years, like the Warren Report, it's been discredited in a year.
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.822]  And, I mean, is that accurate to say?
[00:14:59.822 --> 00:15:00.942]  Pretty much.
[00:15:00.942 --> 00:15:05.565]  And I'm just pointing out, it wasn't just kooks who are critiquing the report.
[00:15:05.565 --> 00:15:09.987]  You've got, you know, chief economists and, you know,
[00:15:10.962 --> 00:15:14.635]  Cabinet secretaries, physics professors, you know, we've got some...
[00:15:15.559 --> 00:15:21.164]  And like you pointed out, Tom, you know, demolition experts, the insurance company, there's all sorts of people.
[00:15:21.164 --> 00:15:24.266]  I mean, the amount of information on this is astounding.
[00:15:24.266 --> 00:15:26.348]  I mean, I could make it a full-time job.
[00:15:26.348 --> 00:15:28.629]  Well, I mean, sir, it's... I'll leave that up to others.
[00:15:28.629 --> 00:15:30.531]  Sir, I mean, it's exponential.
[00:15:30.531 --> 00:15:37.997]  This weekend, I had people in shopping malls coming up to me and the folks I was with and in restaurants saying, you know, thank you for exposing 9-11.
[00:15:37.997 --> 00:15:41.399]  Thank Charlie Sheen for me, you know, for exposing 9-11.
[00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:42.340]  I mean, it's just everywhere.
[00:15:43.089 --> 00:15:43.789]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:15:43.789 --> 00:15:45.450]  I mean, I was in a city I don't even live in.
[00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:48.412]  I mean, I was in a city where I'm not even on the radio.
[00:15:48.412 --> 00:15:52.694]  I'm on the radio south of there, but, you know, the point is, is that it's just everywhere.
[00:15:52.694 --> 00:15:54.194]  Yeah, I think so, yes.
[00:15:54.194 --> 00:16:06.060]  And, I mean, just for the record, on the morning of 9-11, I was living in Vancouver, which is three hours behind New York City, and about seven in the morning, I get a call.
[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:06.841]  It's my brother.
[00:16:06.841 --> 00:16:07.701]  He's, like, crying.
[00:16:08.266 --> 00:16:29.232]  Saying, you know, the Trade Center's on fire, the Pentagon's on fire, and planes hit the Trade Center, and I couldn't believe it, and I turned on the TV, and I watched the towers fall alive, and I got a sick feeling in my stomach, because my first thought was like, holy, no, they had this really planned out, they stuffed the building full of charges, too!
[00:16:29.232 --> 00:16:33.713]  I didn't think that, you know, the fires had caused... Sir, sir, I had a degreed structural engineer
[00:16:34.891 --> 00:16:41.214]  Uh... Jimmy Wright, who worked in the World Financial Center, saw the second plane hit.
[00:16:41.214 --> 00:16:53.019]  I had him there on the ground being evacuated on the ferry, and right after they fell, right when I went on at 11 a.m., I mean, the dust was still in the air, and he was saying, perfect controlled demolition,
[00:16:53.519 --> 00:16:57.821]  I haven't really researched September 11th and all these details so deeply, but the interesting thing about Building 7 is I had no idea
[00:17:12.828 --> 00:17:15.511]  That apparently wasn't told.
[00:17:15.511 --> 00:17:20.896]  I mean, as far as I knew that day, I thought I'd heard on the news that they did intentionally demolish Building 7.
[00:17:20.896 --> 00:17:21.937]  A lot of people heard that.
[00:17:21.937 --> 00:17:24.920]  New Yorkers heard it on NPR that they were going to, quote, demolish it.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.962]  And then now they try to cover that up.
[00:17:26.962 --> 00:17:27.523]  Just stay there.
[00:17:27.523 --> 00:17:30.826]  I want to specifically, though, talk about the editors saying no.
[00:17:30.826 --> 00:17:35.550]  I mean, that's the real story here, is that the editors said no, no, no.
[00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:36.131]  We'll be right back.
[00:17:39.682 --> 00:17:42.784]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:17:42.784 --> 00:17:44.705]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:17:44.705 --> 00:17:49.708]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:17:49.708 --> 00:17:54.571]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:17:54.571 --> 00:17:58.753]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:17:58.973 --> 00:18:01.894]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:18:01.894 --> 00:18:06.774]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:18:06.774 --> 00:18:11.415]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:18:11.415 --> 00:18:18.877]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:18:18.877 --> 00:18:21.457]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:18:21.457 --> 00:18:23.277]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[00:18:39.085 --> 00:18:40.846]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:18:40.846 --> 00:18:45.088]  You know, Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:18:45.088 --> 00:18:48.049]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:18:48.049 --> 00:18:54.713]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:18:54.933 --> 00:18:58.135]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:18:58.135 --> 00:19:00.656]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:19:00.656 --> 00:19:10.802]  Black-Murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as atrazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[00:19:11.022 --> 00:19:20.289]  MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[00:19:20.289 --> 00:19:28.075]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:19:28.075 --> 00:19:28.435]  That's 888-803-4438.

[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:40.461]  I'm good.
[00:19:55.502 --> 00:19:56.103]  I think so.
[00:20:15.663 --> 00:20:16.304]  We're good to go!
[00:20:42.831 --> 00:20:44.952]  And this has nothing to do with 9-11, but I gotta read it.
[00:20:44.952 --> 00:20:46.533]  Tacoma, Washington, AP.
[00:20:46.533 --> 00:20:49.235]  Talk about taking a bite out of crime.
[00:20:49.235 --> 00:20:59.721]  Government lawyers tried to confiscate the gold tooth caps as grills from the mouths of two men facing drug charges, saying the dental work qualified as seizable assets.
[00:20:59.721 --> 00:21:05.804]  The feds had the suspects in a vehicle headed to a dental clinic by the time defense lawyers persuaded a judge to halt the procedure.
[00:21:06.878 --> 00:21:14.765]  And he says, I've been doing this for over 30 years and never heard of anything like this, said Richard Troberman, past president of the Washington Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.
[00:21:14.765 --> 00:21:20.830]  It sounds like Nazi Germany when they were removing the gold teeth from the bodies, but at least then they waited until they were dead.
[00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:23.031]  I mean, this is the... They're not even convicted.
[00:21:23.031 --> 00:21:24.072]  They're not even to trial.
[00:21:24.072 --> 00:21:26.354]  They're not even charged.
[00:21:26.354 --> 00:21:27.255]  I'm sorry.
[00:21:27.255 --> 00:21:30.217]  Folks, I've got a giant stack I didn't get to just as bad as this.
[00:21:30.217 --> 00:21:33.660]  I mean, we're entering the outer limits, okay?
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:35.502]  Going back to our guest, Ryder
[00:21:36.961 --> 00:21:45.384]  For several years, every week op-ed columnist for the Winnipeg Free Press, we have links to that site and to his site and a bunch of others up on Infowars.com.
[00:21:45.384 --> 00:21:48.905]  Dallas, just in the last few minutes we've got left and I want to get you back up some time for longer.
[00:21:48.905 --> 00:21:50.966]  I really appreciate your courage coming on.
[00:21:50.966 --> 00:22:04.430]  Specifically, I mean, are you going to get in trouble now for contacting us and talking about how you're getting basically censored by your editor because just reporting on a cultural phenomenon, you weren't even saying this stuff is facts, he's saying no.
[00:22:05.638 --> 00:22:18.844]  Well, you know, worst case scenario, I mean, I won't have a column anymore, but I mean, I don't think anybody at the Free Press listens to the Alex Jones Show, so I should be okay.
[00:22:18.844 --> 00:22:20.765]  Sir, this is going to get posted.
[00:22:20.765 --> 00:22:21.626]  This is going to get out there.
[00:22:21.626 --> 00:22:22.326]  They're going to find out.
[00:22:22.326 --> 00:22:25.227]  So what do you want to go ahead and say to your editor?
[00:22:25.227 --> 00:22:26.108]  Sorry, Mr. Flood.
[00:22:26.108 --> 00:22:31.150]  You should have run it!
[00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:32.991]  Anything else he said to you in this conversation?
[00:22:33.783 --> 00:22:40.246]  Well, we had a good debate going for about half an hour until eventually he just said, you know, got better things to do later.
[00:22:40.246 --> 00:22:47.228]  I was just trying to document the phenomenon.
[00:22:47.228 --> 00:22:56.252]  My opinion is that I was trying to connect the 9-11 report to what happened with the Warren report and how a counter mythology is being developed to the
[00:22:57.792 --> 00:23:05.655]  9-11 report just as Oliver Stone's JFK movie provided a kind of counter mythology to the Warren Report eventually.
[00:23:05.655 --> 00:23:09.717]  I mean, JFK was a pretty influential movie for me.
[00:23:09.717 --> 00:23:16.659]  I was a teenager when I saw it and it really changed my perspective of the world as well.
[00:23:16.659 --> 00:23:25.943]  I mean, that's why it really affected me to hear Charlie Sheen come out as courageously as he did because I'm a huge fan of his cinema and
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.180]  He started this great in Wall Street.
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.761]  I know he's worked with Oliver Stone a couple times before.
[00:23:30.761 --> 00:23:38.103]  Well, you know, that's a key point you just made, and the word is, I call it amazing courage, but the key word is courageousness.
[00:23:38.103 --> 00:23:40.004]  He is an example for everybody.
[00:23:40.004 --> 00:23:48.267]  He has unwittingly written himself into the history books, not for his films, which he's already there for that, 65 plus, but his courage.
[00:23:48.267 --> 00:23:51.588]  People saw that as a model to model themselves after.
[00:23:51.588 --> 00:23:52.988]  He's got a lot to lose, and he did this.
[00:23:53.248 --> 00:23:54.588]  He's got more to lose than I do.
[00:23:54.588 --> 00:23:56.869]  He's got a huge TV show.
[00:23:56.869 --> 00:24:03.131]  I don't know what he makes per episode, but I get $250 a week for my columns.
[00:24:03.131 --> 00:24:04.892]  He's definitely got a lot more to lose than I do.
[00:24:04.892 --> 00:24:08.273]  That's why I was unhesitant in coming forward to you with this.
[00:24:08.273 --> 00:24:11.634]  As I said, my editor and I, we kind of had a back and forth.
[00:24:11.634 --> 00:24:14.715]  So it's fair to say his courage pushed you to have courage?
[00:24:14.715 --> 00:24:16.236]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:24:17.354 --> 00:24:18.294]  That's what I get from this.
[00:24:18.294 --> 00:24:26.897]  I mean, out of 20 plus reporters I've talked to, or columnists, or producers, you're the only one that had the nerve to come on here and talk about it.
[00:24:26.897 --> 00:24:29.438]  Well, good on me, I suppose.
[00:24:29.438 --> 00:24:32.139]  Well, you're another example of courage for these reporters.
[00:24:32.139 --> 00:24:36.941]  And the more of you stand up and say you're being censored, it'll be a major breakout for everybody.
[00:24:36.941 --> 00:24:43.983]  But again, your column was just reporting on the, or editorializing on the phenomenon
[00:24:44.483 --> 00:24:45.664]  He didn't realize I was ahead of my time.
[00:25:03.138 --> 00:25:05.580]  All right, I appreciate you coming on with us, Dallas Hanson.
[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:11.544]  We'll check in with you in the future, and anytime they won't publish your columns, you send them to me, and you'll get about 2 million readers.
[00:25:11.544 --> 00:25:12.064]  How's that sound?
[00:25:12.064 --> 00:25:12.965]  Sounds great, Alex.
[00:25:12.965 --> 00:25:14.086]  All right, God bless.
[00:25:14.086 --> 00:25:15.607]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[00:25:15.607 --> 00:25:16.448]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
