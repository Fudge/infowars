[00:00:05.497 --> 00:00:06.137]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.798 --> 00:00:07.878]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:09.739]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.180]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.901 --> 00:00:12.821]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.461 --> 00:00:17.144]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.644 --> 00:00:21.786]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.806 --> 00:00:23.187]  Music
[00:00:34.395 --> 00:00:35.896]  Welcome, my friends, welcome.
[00:00:36.177 --> 00:00:43.603]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Monday, the 21st day of August, 2006.
[00:00:44.063 --> 00:00:46.525]  We're going to be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:46.565 --> 00:00:47.246]  We're going to have...
[00:00:48.132 --> 00:01:00.778]  The former British ambassador to Uzbekistan who broke all the news about the British government working with their government and the US government torturing individuals overseas to get fake terror confessions.
[00:01:01.338 --> 00:01:08.702]  He's also been writing big news stories for major British newspapers concerning the fact that these terror alerts have been and are
[00:01:09.762 --> 00:01:13.303]  ...staged, including reports on government-sponsored terror.
[00:01:13.704 --> 00:01:20.106]  He was going to join us last Friday, but there was a carbon monoxide leak in his apartment complex.
[00:01:20.506 --> 00:01:26.608]  People went to the hospital right around the time he was supposed to join us, so they had a good old-fashioned emergency.
[00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:31.710]  So we've confirmed with him just a few minutes ago he will be on in the second hour today.
[00:01:32.111 --> 00:01:37.853]  Then coming up in the third hour, Kevin Smith went to one of these...
[00:01:39.011 --> 00:01:46.922]  Meetings here in Central Texas against the Trans-Texas Corridor, the American Union Lifeblood Lifeline, my friends.
[00:01:47.342 --> 00:01:49.405]  And he had a chance to meet Hank Gilbert.
[00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:57.431]  And Hank Gilbert's running for office here in Texas, but we're having Iman as an example of a good type of folks we need running for office.
[00:01:57.451 --> 00:02:10.455]  We'll be talking about the American Union, the Animal ID Act, and so much more here on the neo-feudalist, fascist police state that we are entering, that we are attempting to stop, my friends.
[00:02:11.795 --> 00:02:14.736]  All right, here's the type of news I have in front of me today.
[00:02:15.856 --> 00:02:16.216]  U.S.
[00:02:16.256 --> 00:02:19.177]  says Lebanon truce may unravel.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:27.704]  No kidding, after Israel, Friday and over the weekend, launched attacks into Lebanon, trying to ensure that the ceasefire does not hold.
[00:02:27.845 --> 00:02:29.105]  We'll cover that report.
[00:02:30.186 --> 00:02:33.848]  Also, militant recruiters cited for misconduct.
[00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:35.570]  That's a nice way to put it.
[00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.131]  Assaulting and raping women.
[00:02:37.671 --> 00:02:44.635]  More than 100 young women who expressed interest in joining the military in the past year were preyed upon sexually by the recruiters.
[00:02:45.055 --> 00:02:51.819]  Women were raped on recruiting office couches, assaulted in government cars, and groped en route to entrance exams.
[00:02:54.161 --> 00:02:57.563]  Gotta have your camp whores in the modern centurion military.
[00:02:58.363 --> 00:02:59.324]  Look, I don't want to hear it.
[00:02:59.664 --> 00:03:01.145]  Oh, our military's great and good.
[00:03:01.878 --> 00:03:12.927]  I've got a mainstream news piece we're going to play part of later in this hour where they admit that now the majority of the new recruits are hardcore gang members.
[00:03:14.108 --> 00:03:19.432]  They are now, for the last five years, recruiting hardcore convicted felons.
[00:03:20.292 --> 00:03:23.975]  By the way, they don't just take felons, they take aggravated felons.
[00:03:24.696 --> 00:03:26.037]  Well, that's what Stalin did.
[00:03:26.738 --> 00:03:32.503]  Stalin opened up all the jails and released the hardcore killers and rapists, and they made up the backbone of his government.
[00:03:32.983 --> 00:03:34.284]  It's going to be the same way here.
[00:03:35.345 --> 00:03:36.405]  By the way, I'm not joking.
[00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:37.807]  I'm not exaggerating.
[00:03:37.847 --> 00:03:38.687]  I'm not embellishing.
[00:03:38.807 --> 00:03:40.609]  I mean what I just said.
[00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:43.071]  You want to be ruled by scumbag gang members?
[00:03:43.411 --> 00:03:45.773]  You're going to be.
[00:03:45.813 --> 00:03:51.337]  Continuing, Bush final gambled, giving Iraq a dictator.
[00:03:51.377 --> 00:03:52.638]  This is the Times of London.
[00:03:53.337 --> 00:03:59.321]  Came out Sunday, the Sunday Times of London, the biggest one-day publication in England every Sunday.
[00:03:59.341 --> 00:04:05.104]  And they're openly saying in strategy meetings that dictatorship is the answer.
[00:04:05.905 --> 00:04:10.127]  I guess it was when our government put Saddam in in 79, and it will be now.
[00:04:11.008 --> 00:04:13.809]  Meet the Ba'athists, same as the old Ba'athists.
[00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.551]  U.S.
[00:04:15.631 --> 00:04:18.192]  loses 30 soldiers in the last 20 days in Iraq.
[00:04:18.212 --> 00:04:18.973]  I'll get to that later.
[00:04:18.993 --> 00:04:20.654]  But going back to this...
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.962]  Bush administration moved to put a dictator back in control.
[00:04:27.343 --> 00:04:28.123]  It's the same thing.
[00:04:28.223 --> 00:04:29.904]  Put a thug in control in Iraq.
[00:04:30.384 --> 00:04:33.206]  Put gang members in the police department and the military here.
[00:04:34.387 --> 00:04:35.908]  This is what it's all about.
[00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:41.551]  You've got a bunch of naive, stupid people who still think Bush is a conservative sucking their thumbs.
[00:04:43.552 --> 00:04:44.893]  Alright, there's so much other news.
[00:04:45.193 --> 00:04:49.376]  I told you a long time ago that Bill Gates' foundation is a big fat scam.
[00:04:49.816 --> 00:04:52.658]  Here's just the latest in that soap opera.
[00:04:53.524 --> 00:04:56.406]  Wait till you hear what he's financing with his billions.
[00:04:56.446 --> 00:04:56.906]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.272 --> 00:05:07.454]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:07.794 --> 00:05:09.735]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.096 --> 00:05:17.721]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.444 --> 00:05:25.465]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.866 --> 00:05:37.288]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.608 --> 00:05:41.129]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:43.489]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.829 --> 00:05:47.670]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.326 --> 00:06:03.728]  Your area has just unexpectedly flooded.
[00:06:03.948 --> 00:06:07.451]  The power's out, so is the water, and you are thirsty.
[00:06:07.531 --> 00:06:10.173]  But wait, outside, look, there's lots of water!
[00:06:10.433 --> 00:06:11.494]  And then you see it.
[00:06:11.594 --> 00:06:13.336]  Oh my gosh!
[00:06:13.656 --> 00:06:15.598]  What is that floating in the water?
[00:06:16.098 --> 00:06:18.160]  And what is that odor?
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.601]  No problem.
[00:06:19.801 --> 00:06:23.083]  You thought ahead and own a Berkey water purification system.
[00:06:23.223 --> 00:06:27.025]  Berkey has revolutionized the way water is purified simply and naturally.
[00:06:27.145 --> 00:06:38.752]  Requiring no power, electricity, or water pressure, the powerful black Berkey elements extract pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, heavy metals, and yeah, other nasties that might be found in flood water.
[00:06:38.992 --> 00:06:46.596]  Berkey systems can purify treated water during normal times, and during unexpected emergencies, they can get rid of the unhealthy stuff in raw, untreated
[00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:46.876]  That's 888-803-4438
[00:07:00.413 --> 00:07:07.215]  The Bill of Rights is a term for the first ten amendments of the Constitution, limiting the federal government's power and preserving the rights of the people.
[00:07:07.655 --> 00:07:10.656]  Each day, we gradually lose these rights that we are entitled to.
[00:07:10.976 --> 00:07:14.897]  We need to take a stand to let the government know that we are tired of losing our rights.
[00:07:15.257 --> 00:07:16.858]  Today, you can take this stand.
[00:07:17.138 --> 00:07:22.340]  You can express your beliefs by wearing a new and innovative t-shirt available only through GCN.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:28.321]  Each shirt is black, with a redesign of the famous Don't Tread on Me Gaston flag located on the front of the shirt.
[00:07:28.702 --> 00:07:30.162]  On the back is the Bill of Rights
[00:07:30.562 --> 00:07:35.003]  Each shirt is $15, plus $7 shipping.
[00:07:35.243 --> 00:07:41.524]  Please send a check or money order for $22, along with size and the number of shirts being ordered, to Liberty's.
[00:07:41.884 --> 00:07:46.445]  That's L-I-B-B-E-R-T-E-E-S.
[00:07:46.465 --> 00:07:49.426]  447 Thompson Bay Loop, New Blaine, Arkansas.
[00:07:49.446 --> 00:07:49.426]  72851.
[00:07:50.686 --> 00:07:54.387]  Or go to GCNlive.com to view this great shirt today.
[00:07:54.707 --> 00:07:56.327]  Sizes XXL and larger at $2.
[00:07:57.148 --> 00:07:58.588]  Arkansas residents at 8% sales tax.
[00:08:00.862 --> 00:08:05.884]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.265 --> 00:08:08.606]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:15.089 --> 00:08:28.835]  After I had gotten off air Friday afternoon, I saw a story we posted at PrisonPlanet.com about how the government is going to allow corporations
[00:08:29.833 --> 00:08:42.601]  To not just radiate your meat with high-powered radiation beams, but to also baste and soak your meats in virus bombs, virus baths.
[00:08:43.502 --> 00:08:50.346]  And the viruses are going to be grown in giant tanks with deadly bacteria that kill humans.
[00:08:51.628 --> 00:09:00.718]  So they can then spray the virus on the meat, and so six different types of bacteria won't be able to kill you, and they can feed you rotten meat.
[00:09:01.639 --> 00:09:10.329]  Now, they reported the problem is that the rotten meat, what really makes you get sick is the excretions, the defecation,
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.482]  The waste of bacteria.
[00:09:13.522 --> 00:09:16.684]  It is really those toxins in most types of food poisoning.
[00:09:16.704 --> 00:09:20.506]  Different things can cause it, but generally it is the toxins of the bacteria.
[00:09:21.207 --> 00:09:28.391]  But the meat producers will just simply sponge them off, hopefully getting most of the toxin off.
[00:09:28.732 --> 00:09:40.920]  You'll be eating a delicious amalgam, a delicious casserole of decomposing meat, viruses, and dead bacteria and their feces.
[00:09:42.737 --> 00:09:43.197]  We're good to go.
[00:09:43.218 --> 00:09:43.358]  I think?
[00:10:06.324 --> 00:10:13.807]  And I had a caller on my Sunday show on KLBJ that is going to be syndicated by the Genesis Communications Radio Network, by the way.
[00:10:14.187 --> 00:10:17.489]  In the next few months, that will be available to all the Genesis stations.
[00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:18.309]  We hope you'll pick it up.
[00:10:18.929 --> 00:10:22.751]  I believe it's from 4 to 6 right now, but it should be from 3 to 6.
[00:10:23.031 --> 00:10:24.291]  But I'll announce that later.
[00:10:24.311 --> 00:10:28.073]  The point is that I was on the radio Sunday.
[00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:44.946]  And sure enough, first caller, when I started the show with the story about the viruses that translate into the Greek to bacteria eaters, the guy calls in, he says, I'm a biologist and this is good.
[00:10:44.986 --> 00:10:48.869]  And I said, are the vaccines that have viruses attack the brain, are they good?
[00:10:48.889 --> 00:10:51.551]  And he said, yes, if it stops you from using drugs.
[00:10:51.972 --> 00:10:54.514]  Basically, anything that's scientific is good.
[00:10:55.014 --> 00:10:56.015]  It's like a religion.
[00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:04.001]  I'm all for science, folks, but just because we can radiate food doesn't mean we should.
[00:11:04.061 --> 00:11:10.023]  Just because we can spray bacteria-killing viruses on the meat doesn't mean we should.
[00:11:10.343 --> 00:11:14.624]  Just because we can jump off cliffs doesn't mean we should.
[00:11:14.824 --> 00:11:21.945]  But he just couldn't get it, wouldn't get it, and I basically ended up yelling at him and hanging up on him.
[00:11:23.032 --> 00:11:24.093]  Maybe he's listening today.
[00:11:24.113 --> 00:11:30.197]  He said he's a listener to the weekday show, so you're welcome to call in today again, sir, and explain this.
[00:11:30.237 --> 00:11:31.718]  He said, well, it's been checked out.
[00:11:31.778 --> 00:11:33.879]  The FDA says it's okay.
[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:37.102]  The FDA approved aspartame.
[00:11:37.122 --> 00:11:38.542]  The FDA approved MSG.
[00:11:38.923 --> 00:11:50.871]  The FDA has approved genetically engineered potatoes and tomatoes and corn filled with any number of bacteria, genes, virus, fragments...
[00:11:52.349 --> 00:12:05.577]  Insect genes, and there's all these big studies that come out saying that it's causing major toxic effects in the human body and allergies and all other sorts of problems, killing the rats that eat it, by the way, universally.
[00:12:06.078 --> 00:12:08.579]  And they say, well, we're still approving it, saying it's still safe.
[00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:16.524]  So I'm looking for the Food and Drug Administration to approve cyanide as a headache aid or something.
[00:12:16.564 --> 00:12:19.206]  I mean, it'll cure your headache because you'll be as dead as a doornail.
[00:12:21.477 --> 00:12:26.561]  I mean, we've got federal studies now saying, oh, don't worry about all those studies saying mercury's causing autism.
[00:12:27.642 --> 00:12:29.683]  Mercury really is good for your brain.
[00:12:32.145 --> 00:12:33.586]  Good for your brain.
[00:12:33.686 --> 00:12:39.331]  Actually, the study says in a lawyer twist that it's good for behavior.
[00:12:39.991 --> 00:12:43.013]  Yes, you will sit there staring at the wall because you're brain damaged.
[00:12:43.654 --> 00:12:50.059]  And then they say that better behavior then leads to better retention of the materials.
[00:12:50.925 --> 00:12:52.306]  Of the class material.
[00:12:52.806 --> 00:12:53.246]  The course.
[00:12:54.166 --> 00:12:56.187]  They always tell you what they're doing to you right out in the open.
[00:12:56.467 --> 00:13:01.749]  Oh, this causes higher test scores because it makes you behave better.
[00:13:01.809 --> 00:13:08.491]  But I thought the mercury in the shots was to keep the viruses fresh and delicious.
[00:13:10.152 --> 00:13:10.392]  Okay.
[00:13:12.307 --> 00:13:14.869]  You see, we're already living in a science fiction nightmare.
[00:13:14.889 --> 00:13:25.656]  We're already having our DNA, our brain tissue, our entire endocrine system, our nervous systems manipulated on a day-to-day basis.
[00:13:25.716 --> 00:13:27.017]  It's in the food by design.
[00:13:27.097 --> 00:13:28.318]  It's in the water by design.
[00:13:28.598 --> 00:13:30.379]  It's in the vaccinations by design.
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:37.944]  They are now approving spraying Dow Chemical wants to spray crops nationwide with vaccines.
[00:13:38.991 --> 00:13:42.214]  Sodium and stannous fluoride, two different types of toxic fluoride.
[00:13:42.835 --> 00:13:52.545]  It's going to act both as a pesticide, because the bugs then won't eat it, and also they say you're not getting enough fluoride, America, so they're going to make you take it.
[00:13:52.585 --> 00:14:02.035]  You see, fluoride will go right through the membrane of the vegetables and the fruits and will settle out in the tissues of the plants.
[00:14:04.222 --> 00:14:12.369]  And you will eat a delicious, chloride-laden, toxic, IQ-reducing compound.
[00:14:12.609 --> 00:14:20.176]  And again, official, award-winning, historical books on World War II document the Nazis' first used
[00:14:20.871 --> 00:14:25.914]  Sodium and stainless fluoride from the University of Texas studies conducted in 32-33.
[00:14:26.254 --> 00:14:37.199]  The Nazis, by as early as 39, were using it in high levels to pacify their slave labor population.
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:39.761]  Doesn't matter, though.
[00:14:39.801 --> 00:14:41.481]  We have a public that's been drinking it.
[00:14:42.322 --> 00:14:46.664]  Notice when you go to the baby store or the grocery store, it says, fluoridated for kids.
[00:14:46.684 --> 00:14:50.426]  Your kids need it as added levels, even higher than municipal water.
[00:14:51.129 --> 00:14:52.110]  But wait a minute.
[00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:59.934]  The studies are now coming out saying, well, Americans aren't drinking enough fluoride.
[00:14:59.974 --> 00:15:00.795]  They're not getting enough.
[00:15:00.815 --> 00:15:01.335]  But wait a minute.
[00:15:01.795 --> 00:15:08.379]  Then you get hundreds of times even the level that the Food and Drug Administration says your teeth need in the toothpaste.
[00:15:08.419 --> 00:15:10.761]  I mean, that stuff is super strong.
[00:15:11.261 --> 00:15:14.663]  But even with that, now you're avoiding the water, so you're not getting enough.
[00:15:14.723 --> 00:15:16.344]  And, oh, you're evading the tooth poise.
[00:15:17.064 --> 00:15:18.124]  I think we're good to go.
[00:15:42.742 --> 00:15:47.647]  Because they're going to spray these viruses on most of the meats.
[00:15:55.111 --> 00:15:55.611]  We're good to go.
[00:15:55.631 --> 00:15:55.812]  I think?
[00:16:14.311 --> 00:16:20.616]  And so, well, then if you already have them in your stomach, then why would you need them sprayed on your food?
[00:16:20.716 --> 00:16:33.845]  And again, they're going to cook these up in these big troughs at these pharmaceutical companies with all the other problems and all the other viruses that accidentally they claim grow and with the history of the vaccine makers.
[00:16:33.865 --> 00:16:35.906]  And this is a vaccine, folks, for your meat.
[00:16:35.926 --> 00:16:38.028]  We're going to vaccinate the meat now.
[00:16:39.569 --> 00:16:40.790]  Live vaccine on your meat.
[00:16:41.676 --> 00:16:44.418]  It just spins off into all these other problems.
[00:16:44.438 --> 00:16:45.439]  There's no long-term studies.
[00:16:45.459 --> 00:16:47.321]  They don't know what it will do to your gut flora.
[00:16:47.341 --> 00:16:49.242]  They don't know what it will do in your stomach.
[00:16:50.263 --> 00:16:52.445]  Who knows what's going to be in these big crops?
[00:16:52.525 --> 00:16:54.446]  And the FDA barely approved it.
[00:16:54.867 --> 00:16:57.829]  And again, they'll approve a bullet in the head.
[00:16:57.849 --> 00:16:58.730]  I mean, they'll approve anything.
[00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:06.296]  They barely approved it because they are worried about the fact that it will just kill the bacteria and allow them to feed you, sell you rotten meat.
[00:17:08.337 --> 00:17:15.128]  But they said the beef manufacturers, the poultry producers, they promise to scrub the food.
[00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:21.199]  If it turns green, they'll scrub it off with soap and detergents and then spray it with the viruses.
[00:17:22.091 --> 00:17:26.692]  And then you shouldn't get too many of the bacteria poo-poo.
[00:17:27.293 --> 00:17:28.133]  That's what it is.
[00:17:28.733 --> 00:17:29.993]  You're not supposed to eat that.
[00:17:30.654 --> 00:17:32.794]  I mean, this is just, it's hell on earth.
[00:17:32.954 --> 00:17:45.838]  All these big studies about how when they irradiate meat products, tuna fish, poultry from chickens and turkeys and beef and everything else, that when they irradiate it,
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.162]  It just kills the bacteria, so you're now eating the dead bacteria and their toxins.
[00:17:53.482 --> 00:17:58.604]  And it destroys the ring structures and the different enzymes.
[00:17:58.704 --> 00:18:00.344]  Everything you need to absorb it.
[00:18:01.505 --> 00:18:03.005]  You're eating a totally dead food.
[00:18:05.086 --> 00:18:06.566]  And there's a bunch of studies on that.
[00:18:06.606 --> 00:18:07.207]  They don't care.
[00:18:07.867 --> 00:18:10.968]  School lunch programs, most of the tuna fish you get in those little packages.
[00:18:10.988 --> 00:18:13.349]  It's in a bag instead of a can.
[00:18:15.644 --> 00:18:18.245]  Most of the food now, the processed stuff, has been irradiated.
[00:18:18.285 --> 00:18:20.026]  They've got radiation plants all over the country.
[00:18:20.046 --> 00:18:22.046]  They don't even tell you it's irradiated.
[00:18:22.127 --> 00:18:23.727]  Oh, that's in the AP article, too.
[00:18:23.967 --> 00:18:31.010]  They're not going to tell you when they soak the ham, soak the turkey, soak the steak, spray the hamburger.
[00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.451]  They're not going to tell you that they're doing this.
[00:18:34.911 --> 00:18:35.652]  It's in the article.
[00:18:37.092 --> 00:18:39.433]  You see, you don't even get a choice now.
[00:18:42.129 --> 00:18:52.792]  And biologists call into the show and say, yeah, I've heard of the plan to have a vaccine by law we have to take that goes in and attacks the receptor sites in the brain.
[00:18:52.972 --> 00:18:55.852]  That sounds like a good idea to end drug addiction.
[00:18:57.853 --> 00:18:58.313]  You know what?
[00:18:58.393 --> 00:19:05.595]  Those receptors, you fools, are the receptors that pick up your natural endorphins.
[00:19:06.795 --> 00:19:08.935]  They're there for a reason.
[00:19:09.295 --> 00:19:11.396]  This is literally a lobotomy.
[00:19:13.032 --> 00:19:17.216]  And we're coming to the day where they will send heavily armed SWAT teams to your home.
[00:19:17.236 --> 00:19:20.399]  I think you can learn, folks, I don't joke about stuff.
[00:19:20.419 --> 00:19:22.901]  This is what I really believe will happen, and I've studied it, it's going to happen.
[00:19:23.642 --> 00:19:33.671]  Within five to ten years, they will send heavily armed social workers to your house, paramilitary social workers, that's what the government is, that's what the police are now, to force you to take this.
[00:19:35.553 --> 00:19:37.795]  Don't worry, though, the studies show it will cause some depression.
[00:19:38.948 --> 00:19:44.230]  But then they have other drugs that they say are safe government drugs that affect other receptors that they will prescribe to you.
[00:19:45.671 --> 00:19:46.011]  So see?
[00:19:46.031 --> 00:19:47.992]  No problem.
[00:19:49.313 --> 00:19:54.595]  Viruses that eat your brain cells, viruses on the meat, viruses on the vegetables.
[00:19:54.815 --> 00:19:55.916]  Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
[00:19:55.956 --> 00:19:57.396]  I love the New World Order.
[00:19:57.837 --> 00:19:58.517]  I just love it.
[00:20:01.371 --> 00:20:09.636]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:14.238]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:20:14.539 --> 00:20:23.444]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:20:23.664 --> 00:20:27.286]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:20:27.526 --> 00:20:28.227]  We're good to go.
[00:20:28.287 --> 00:20:28.588]  I think?
[00:20:41.317 --> 00:20:42.678]  Currency, devaluation, inflation.
[00:20:42.698 --> 00:20:43.178]  One and the same.
[00:21:10.774 --> 00:21:20.597]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:21:21.037 --> 00:21:24.159]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:21:24.419 --> 00:21:26.259]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:21:26.559 --> 00:21:29.340]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.101]  Here is reality.
[00:21:32.461 --> 00:21:36.043]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:21:36.543 --> 00:21:40.144]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:21:40.751 --> 00:21:44.495]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[00:21:44.935 --> 00:21:48.659]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.

[00:22:06.519 --> 00:22:12.705]  Did you know that the United Nations' basic philosophy is both anti-American and pro-dictatorship?
[00:22:13.045 --> 00:22:22.374]  Did you know that the United Nations was founded by communist and Marxist members of the Council on Foreign Relations whose goal is a socialistic one-world government?
[00:22:23.752 --> 00:22:24.433]  I think we're good to go.

[00:23:01.863 --> 00:23:04.365]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:23:04.465 --> 00:23:06.826]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[00:23:06.907 --> 00:23:13.091]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[00:23:14.572 --> 00:23:16.873]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:23:17.514 --> 00:23:21.056]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:23:21.617 --> 00:23:25.739]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:29.262]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:23:30.262 --> 00:23:33.164]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:23:33.905 --> 00:23:39.909]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:23:40.169 --> 00:23:44.312]  That's 1-888-892-6238.

[00:23:47.915 --> 00:23:50.837]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[00:23:51.777 --> 00:23:54.079]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[00:23:54.139 --> 00:23:58.322]  That's 888-8XANADU.
[00:23:58.662 --> 00:23:59.623]  And ask for George.
[00:24:00.988 --> 00:24:02.828]  I think we're good to go.
[00:24:31.895 --> 00:24:36.457]  You know, I just spent about that last 14-minute segment just covering one article.
[00:24:38.258 --> 00:24:41.659]  And I could spend all day just on this one article, but I don't have time to do it.
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:55.085]  FDA says viruses safe for treating meat, a mix of bacteria-killing viruses, can be safely sprayed on cold cuts, hot dogs, and sausages to combat common microbes that kill hundreds of people a year.
[00:24:55.466 --> 00:25:00.728]  Federal health officials said Friday in granting the first-ever approval of viruses as a food additive.
[00:25:01.542 --> 00:25:06.484]  Hey, what's wrong with just demanding standards where you don't have this problem with food?
[00:25:07.025 --> 00:25:11.547]  No, everything from a radiation of these viruses is so they can sell you rotten meat.
[00:25:12.407 --> 00:25:26.674]  A combination of six viruses is designed to be sprayed on ready-to-eat meat and poultry products, including sliced ham and turkey, said John Venanza, President and Chief Executive Officer of the manufacturer Intralexatex, Inc.,
[00:25:27.705 --> 00:25:43.534]  The special viruses called bacteriophages are meant to kill strains of the Listeria bacterium, the Food and Drug Administration said, in declaring it safe to use on ready-to-eat meats prior to their packaging.
[00:25:45.395 --> 00:25:51.839]  Now, who knows what these viruses will do mixing with different already naturally occurring viruses that are in the meat?
[00:25:52.439 --> 00:25:55.221]  Who knows what it will do to the naturally occurring bacteria?
[00:25:55.808 --> 00:26:02.670]  And they go on to admit that these viruses are grown in giant tanks of the normally deadly bacteria.
[00:26:04.171 --> 00:26:06.912]  So they're going to be spraying that on there.
[00:26:06.932 --> 00:26:07.632]  But, oh, it's okay.
[00:26:07.672 --> 00:26:12.134]  They say that they strain it all out and they try to make sure it's clean.
[00:26:12.174 --> 00:26:13.514]  Of course, there will be no inspections.
[00:26:13.534 --> 00:26:20.176]  And, I mean, every major company out there, every major vaccine that comes out ends up killing people and causing problems.
[00:26:20.196 --> 00:26:21.817]  I mean, look at the nightmares we witnessed.
[00:26:22.566 --> 00:26:27.627]  So now, big industrial engineering of viruses to be sprayed on our foods.
[00:26:30.828 --> 00:26:35.069]  And again, there are people that think, well, because this is science, it must be good, it must be okay.
[00:26:35.109 --> 00:26:36.989]  We have an elite sworn to kill us.
[00:26:37.509 --> 00:26:40.430]  We have an elite putting all these poisons and toxins in our food.
[00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:42.590]  Nothing they do can be trusted.
[00:26:44.971 --> 00:26:45.711]  And it goes on.
[00:26:46.151 --> 00:26:49.752]  The viruses are the first to win FDA approval for use as a food additive.
[00:26:50.643 --> 00:26:55.926]  Said Andrew Zajic of the Regulatory Agency's Office of Food Additive Safety.
[00:26:56.826 --> 00:27:03.950]  The bacterium the virus's target can cause a serious infection, primarily in pregnant women, newborns, and adults with weakened immune systems.
[00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:06.351]  So let's put a bunch of viruses into them.
[00:27:07.031 --> 00:27:11.734]  In the United States, an estimated 2,500 people become seriously ill with...
[00:27:13.121 --> 00:27:20.424]  The list of resources, I'm probably pronouncing that wrong, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, of those 500 die.
[00:27:20.744 --> 00:27:29.988]  So because 500 people die, supposedly from this year, because they're feeding you rotten meat, we'll just let them feed you rotten meat, but just spray it with viruses.
[00:27:31.309 --> 00:27:32.209]  And radiate it, too.
[00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:42.013]  Luncheon meats are particularly vulnerable to listeria, since once purchased, they typically aren't cooked or reheated, which can be harmful.
[00:27:44.073 --> 00:27:55.904]  The preparation of the new virus, the Greek name is bacteria eater, attacks only strains of Listeria bacterium and not human or plant cells, the FDA said.
[00:27:55.944 --> 00:27:57.145]  Well, how nice of them.
[00:27:57.506 --> 00:27:58.687]  It's like antibiotics.
[00:27:58.927 --> 00:28:00.849]  What happens when you start using this everywhere?
[00:28:01.069 --> 00:28:03.091]  What's going to rise out of this?
[00:28:03.551 --> 00:28:04.531]  And now they say, no, it's not bad for you.
[00:28:29.451 --> 00:28:31.533]  We have an FDA that wouldn't approve these things.
[00:28:31.773 --> 00:28:33.174]  Now they say it's good for you.
[00:28:33.354 --> 00:28:35.576]  We had an FDA that at least said mercury was bad.
[00:28:35.816 --> 00:28:37.297]  Now they say it's good for you.
[00:28:38.118 --> 00:28:42.961]  No, these viruses are bad for you, and mercury's bad for you, and uranium's bad for you.
[00:28:45.443 --> 00:28:47.465]  I'm trying to find the part here where they admit where they breed it.
[00:28:49.813 --> 00:28:54.022]  As long as it's used in accordance with regulations, we have concluded that it's safe.
[00:28:54.262 --> 00:28:58.671]  Zajic said, people normally come in contact with these viruses through food.
[00:28:58.712 --> 00:29:00.776]  Yeah, in small levels, not engineered.
[00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:02.710]  Water and the environment.
[00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:05.651]  And they are found in our digestive tracts, the FDA said.
[00:29:05.951 --> 00:29:09.332]  Consumers won't be aware that the meat and poultry products have been treated with a spray.
[00:29:09.712 --> 00:29:14.033]  The Department of Agriculture will regulate the actual use of the product internally.
[00:29:14.333 --> 00:29:16.533]  It won't be on the packaging.
[00:29:17.013 --> 00:29:18.734]  Because you're crazy stupid people.
[00:29:19.014 --> 00:29:22.094]  Those of you that don't want it, so we're just not going to let you know.
[00:29:22.114 --> 00:29:24.635]  The viruses are grown in a preparation of...
[00:29:25.658 --> 00:29:35.860]  The very bacteria they killed and then purified the FDA has concerns that the virus preparation potentially could contain toxic residues associated with bacteria.
[00:29:36.141 --> 00:29:38.001]  You mean bacteria's poo-poo?
[00:29:38.681 --> 00:29:44.443]  However, testing did not reveal the presence of such residues in the test batch they gave the FDA.
[00:29:45.103 --> 00:29:48.524]  It says small quantities of bacteria poop will be in your food, though.
[00:29:51.364 --> 00:29:52.264]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.745 --> 00:29:54.245]  The empire's on the run.

[00:30:03.243 --> 00:30:07.405]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:30:07.645 --> 00:30:09.426]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:30:09.686 --> 00:30:16.029]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:30:16.329 --> 00:30:22.492]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:30:22.752 --> 00:30:30.236]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions with no side effects.
[00:30:30.596 --> 00:30:33.457]  Now available is the 2006 BioSolutions Plus.
[00:30:33.658 --> 00:30:37.719]  The BioSolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:41.441]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.

[00:31:02.259 --> 00:31:03.300]  The war on terrorism.
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.422]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:31:06.682 --> 00:31:10.844]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:31:11.264 --> 00:31:12.105]  So what do you do?
[00:31:12.405 --> 00:31:16.968]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:31:17.475 --> 00:31:19.596]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:31:20.076 --> 00:31:34.782]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[00:32:02.089 --> 00:32:02.950]  Flying saucers.
[00:32:03.231 --> 00:32:04.052]  Alien abduction.
[00:32:04.392 --> 00:32:05.073]  Are we alone?

[00:33:03.852 --> 00:33:09.875]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:33:10.475 --> 00:33:13.497]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:24.882]  97% of Americans in major polls don't want the toll roads taking over existing roads.
[00:33:25.502 --> 00:33:31.225]  Most Americans don't even know they're going to put transponders in your car and tax you and track you and give you tickets on top of it.
[00:33:31.245 --> 00:33:32.325]  Imagine if they knew it would be 100%.
[00:33:34.733 --> 00:33:46.640]  99% were against the New London Kelo decision, the Supreme Court ruling that private corporations can come lobby local governments to literally steal your property and not even give you just compensation, just seize it.
[00:33:47.881 --> 00:33:50.562]  Oh yeah, that's another big part of the equation.
[00:33:53.067 --> 00:33:54.969]  Their own documents show DU is deadly.
[00:33:54.989 --> 00:33:55.669]  They just do it.
[00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:58.191]  Their own documents show mercury is bad for your brain.
[00:33:58.211 --> 00:33:58.812]  They just do it.
[00:33:59.272 --> 00:34:10.001]  Their own documents, their own scientific evidence, their own research, the studies show that irradiating food destroys its food value and is really bad for your body.
[00:34:10.682 --> 00:34:11.463]  They just do it.
[00:34:13.044 --> 00:34:15.806]  All the new rules are they don't have to tell you.
[00:34:17.968 --> 00:34:21.031]  Notice how 15, 20 years ago they put everything on the labels.
[00:34:22.668 --> 00:34:23.749]  Because people didn't care.
[00:34:23.789 --> 00:34:24.730]  They trusted the system.
[00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:25.910]  They didn't even look at the label.
[00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:28.072]  So they said, hey, we put everything on the label.
[00:34:28.472 --> 00:34:35.537]  Now you have a move in the country where people are demanding organic, demanding clean, quality foods.
[00:34:35.997 --> 00:34:38.379]  And so they passed a law, what, late last year?
[00:34:38.819 --> 00:34:43.042]  Where now food doesn't even have to be organic to have an organic seal on it.
[00:34:44.383 --> 00:34:48.186]  75% of it can be non-organic, inorganic.
[00:34:48.586 --> 00:34:49.827]  So they can put whatever they want in it.
[00:34:49.847 --> 00:34:50.748]  They can radiate it.
[00:34:50.768 --> 00:34:51.068]  They can...
[00:34:52.424 --> 00:34:53.525]  Use pesticide on it.
[00:34:53.545 --> 00:35:03.289]  They can do whatever they want as long as 25% of it, as long as 25% of it is organic.
[00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:06.990]  You see, it's the same thing here.
[00:35:07.491 --> 00:35:11.592]  Oh, the FDA says we're going to spray your meat with viruses.
[00:35:13.613 --> 00:35:20.196]  And I covered this Sunday, and I got a few emails today, where people who were so lazy, they wouldn't go look up the article.
[00:35:20.236 --> 00:35:21.817]  They would just say, I'm making it up.
[00:35:22.771 --> 00:35:35.915]  But people out there that are in total denial like that, who at their gut level know that viruses being sprayed, being engineered, being sprayed on your food, and then a label not even being put on it, you see, they know that's bad.
[00:35:36.435 --> 00:35:44.038]  But see, they think I'm bad, and I'm the guy that makes this stuff up, so they make a split-second decision to decide I'm making this up.
[00:35:45.598 --> 00:35:51.620]  As soon as they find out it's true, they will then decide and make excuses to themselves that it's okay.
[00:35:52.813 --> 00:35:53.993]  It's called Double Think.
[00:35:55.874 --> 00:35:56.935]  The article goes on and on.
[00:35:56.975 --> 00:35:57.775]  It gets even worse.
[00:35:57.795 --> 00:36:06.778]  There's a whole other page getting into this where the FDA tells you how wonderful the viruses on your food are.
[00:36:06.798 --> 00:36:16.182]  All right, I'm going to get into Bill Gates' Charity Foundation finances something, well, that you wouldn't think would be involved in tax-free foundations.
[00:36:17.973 --> 00:36:19.393]  Also, really serious news.
[00:36:19.894 --> 00:36:21.954]  UN says Lebanon troops may unravel.
[00:36:22.514 --> 00:36:25.235]  Military recruiters cited for misconduct.
[00:36:25.435 --> 00:36:27.135]  Boy, that is putting it lightly.
[00:36:27.795 --> 00:36:30.676]  Bush's final gamble, giving Iraq a dictator.
[00:36:30.716 --> 00:36:31.556]  Times of London.
[00:36:32.537 --> 00:36:35.157]  We've lost 30 soldiers in the last 20 days in Iraq.
[00:36:35.657 --> 00:36:37.458]  Some of the highest levels ever.
[00:36:37.918 --> 00:36:39.318]  A great column out here.
[00:36:40.078 --> 00:36:46.060]  Frank Rich says, five years after 9-11, fear finally strikes out.
[00:36:47.956 --> 00:36:58.265]  And just a human interest story, people can't believe there's evil people in government, especially, you know, blue-haired folks in $3,000 suits and facelifts.
[00:36:59.747 --> 00:37:02.009]  You know, Dick Cheney wouldn't carry out 9-11.
[00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:05.492]  George Bush is a nice young man.
[00:37:05.692 --> 00:37:06.773]  He wears a nice suit.
[00:37:07.493 --> 00:37:10.236]  Anybody who looks conservative can't be involved in evil.
[00:37:11.217 --> 00:37:14.740]  Well, here's CNN today, hit-and-run grannies,
[00:37:16.326 --> 00:37:30.993]  Allegedly drugged victims, Associated Press, two elderly women accused of killing two homeless men in hit-and-run crashes to collect their life insurance, drugged the victims before slowly running them down, authorities said Thursday.
[00:37:32.034 --> 00:37:45.400]  They would take them in, make friends with the homeless, get their names, give them drinks, buy insurance on them, and then take them back in, get them drugged up, put them on the side of the road, and then slowly roll over them because they didn't want to hurt their Cadillacs.
[00:37:47.273 --> 00:37:49.334]  So they'd slowly roll over them four or five times.
[00:37:49.894 --> 00:38:06.081]  It says, if they were awake, it would be a slow, painful death, Deputy District Attorney Shelley Samuel said outside the courtroom after a judge postponed the arraignment of Olga Rudderschmidt, 73, and Helen Golay, 75.
[00:38:07.681 --> 00:38:17.005]  We think they drugged them with pills or alcohol first, then ran them over, Police Detective Dennis Killone said earlier in the statement.
[00:38:17.998 --> 00:38:30.102]  And it goes into how they would take out $800,000 life insurance policies on the homeless, and then they'd allegedly take them out and run over them four or five times apiece.
[00:38:31.642 --> 00:38:34.683]  And they look just like nice grandmas, you see.
[00:38:35.624 --> 00:38:37.504]  Oh, they're wearing a suit and tie.
[00:38:37.524 --> 00:38:39.285]  Oh, they're wearing a police uniform.
[00:38:39.745 --> 00:38:43.266]  Oh, it's a nice health department worker with a pocket protector.
[00:38:43.606 --> 00:38:45.727]  These are the worst people out there.
[00:38:47.037 --> 00:38:48.980]  You don't judge a book by its cover.
[00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:51.843]  Stop being so naive out there.
[00:38:54.787 --> 00:38:55.988]  Stop being stupid.
[00:38:57.690 --> 00:38:59.032]  Stop being so trusting.
[00:38:59.989 --> 00:39:20.125]  I mean, you've got a growing mass of predators in this country that have figured out the general public is dumb as dirt, and then you've got a huge mass of just braying sheep-like creatures out here being fed on, rolling over to tyranny and corruption and oppression, and then you've got a mass of people that do know what's going on, and we're just horrified to see this going on.
[00:39:21.025 --> 00:39:24.328]  And the crooks are scared to death of us that shine the light on them and fight them.
[00:39:25.445 --> 00:39:34.834]  But then they've noticed that the slaves roll over in fear of anybody who even acts like they have authority, so they just gleefully chew into your undersides.
[00:39:35.454 --> 00:39:36.835]  I'm just so sick of watching it.
[00:39:38.857 --> 00:39:41.219]  All these cowed people rolling over.
[00:39:42.841 --> 00:39:44.722]  Okay, let's talk about some real scum.
[00:39:45.043 --> 00:39:46.284]  Well, I'll get to it in a minute.
[00:39:46.364 --> 00:39:47.405]  I've got to plug something first.
[00:39:49.493 --> 00:39:51.974]  Folks, we are carrying The Terror Conspiracy.
[00:39:52.314 --> 00:39:54.615]  It won't be on store shelves until September 11th.
[00:39:55.075 --> 00:39:59.356]  The 450-something page new book by Jim Mars.
[00:39:59.556 --> 00:40:00.957]  Wait, how long is it?
[00:40:01.017 --> 00:40:01.257]  I said 450.
[00:40:02.157 --> 00:40:04.078]  My memory's failing.
[00:40:04.278 --> 00:40:04.758]  482 pages.
[00:40:05.958 --> 00:40:08.239]  Diagrams, photos, documents.
[00:40:08.359 --> 00:40:11.200]  It's an easy read, a quick read, even though it's a thick book.
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:14.581]  You want to be an expert on 9-11, get The Terror Conspiracy.
[00:40:15.461 --> 00:40:16.942]  We've got it before anybody does.
[00:40:17.842 --> 00:40:23.764]  Okay, because Terror Storm is going to be put out in stores in October by the same group that published his book.
[00:40:24.384 --> 00:40:26.165]  And so I'm in business with them.
[00:40:26.225 --> 00:40:29.306]  And so I said, hey, I want to get those as early as possible.
[00:40:29.626 --> 00:40:31.787]  And they said, well, how about we just let you sell them first?
[00:40:32.427 --> 00:40:36.369]  So I have the Terror Conspiracy before anyone else has it.
[00:40:38.369 --> 00:40:39.710]  Before anyone else has it.
[00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:43.111]  So go to InfoWars.com and order the Terror Conspiracy.
[00:40:44.139 --> 00:40:49.442]  And this is so well written, it exposes 9-11 to be an inside job like no other book I know of.
[00:40:49.682 --> 00:40:53.184]  I mean, Tarpley's is excellent as well, but both of them are great books.
[00:40:53.244 --> 00:40:56.406]  But the terror conspiracy really does knock it out of the park.
[00:40:56.706 --> 00:41:05.691]  And the words of Dylan Avery about my film Terror Storm, I think those are applicable to those words to the terror conspiracy, deception, 9-1-1, and the loss of liberty.
[00:41:07.142 --> 00:41:09.064]  By veteran journalist Jim Mars.
[00:41:09.084 --> 00:41:16.971]  And speaking of Jim Mars, he will be in Dallas this weekend, this Saturday, one night only, from 7 o'clock at night until 2 in the morning.
[00:41:17.011 --> 00:41:19.433]  But if some of you don't want to stay that long, just stay until midnight.
[00:41:19.453 --> 00:41:22.996]  But you'll want to stay until midnight because there's going to be some great music there.
[00:41:23.036 --> 00:41:25.979]  I can't believe how good the bands are that are coming out to play for us.
[00:41:25.999 --> 00:41:27.360]  We'll tell you more about them during the week.
[00:41:29.159 --> 00:41:30.880]  Jim Mars, by the way, joins us tomorrow.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:35.221]  Last time we didn't take any calls in two hours talking about the JFK assassination.
[00:41:35.541 --> 00:41:41.483]  Tomorrow we're going to have Jim on for two hours with just open phones on 9-11, JFK, whatever you want.
[00:41:41.543 --> 00:41:42.563]  I promise to have him back.
[00:41:42.823 --> 00:41:45.104]  He'll be with us tomorrow for two hours on the radio.
[00:41:45.684 --> 00:41:52.826]  But coming up this Saturday in Dallas at the historic and beautiful Lakewood Theater, Art Deco Theater.
[00:41:53.604 --> 00:41:54.805]  They've got food and drinks there.
[00:41:55.525 --> 00:41:57.527]  And I'm going to show my new film, Terror Storm.
[00:41:57.547 --> 00:41:59.448]  I'm going to give an hour-long speech and take questions.
[00:41:59.829 --> 00:42:01.750]  Jim will give an hour-long speech and take questions.
[00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:05.232]  Or to be technical, a 45-minute speech and 15 minutes of questions.
[00:42:05.813 --> 00:42:12.217]  And then I'm going to show about 35 minutes of the Bilderberg group footage that we shot in Ottawa a few months ago.
[00:42:12.277 --> 00:42:13.798]  Incredible, never-before-seen stuff.
[00:42:14.199 --> 00:42:16.160]  And then we're going to have three bands.
[00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:18.702]  Shanghai Five, the Arab League, and one other.
[00:42:19.449 --> 00:42:22.391]  Two of them are kind of... I can't describe the third band.
[00:42:22.411 --> 00:42:23.312]  They're really popular.
[00:42:23.552 --> 00:42:31.198]  In fact, Kevin, bring me... Later today in the third hour, Kevin, I want you to come in for five minutes and just talk about these bands.
[00:42:31.338 --> 00:42:39.344]  But to make a long story short, go to InfoWars.com and get your tickets.
[00:42:39.384 --> 00:42:41.746]  Get your e-tickets now to this Dallas event.

[00:43:10.708 --> 00:43:11.969]  We're the lowest price we can.
[00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:14.951]  And then they'll just email you your e-ticket.
[00:43:14.971 --> 00:43:15.932]  You just show that at the door.
[00:43:16.932 --> 00:43:24.996]  Doors open at 6.30, and the show gets started at about 7.15, starting with my new film, Terror Storm, on the big screen.
[00:43:25.016 --> 00:43:31.699]  So again, InfoWars.com to get tickets right now, or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:43:31.719 --> 00:43:37.922]  And then last but not least, of course, my new film, Terror Storm.
[00:43:38.002 --> 00:43:40.763]  The official Terror Storm is available.
[00:43:41.884 --> 00:43:43.244]  It is over three hours.
[00:43:43.304 --> 00:43:44.325]  I've actually done the math.
[00:43:45.559 --> 00:43:48.982]  It is right at about a minute over three hours long.
[00:43:49.742 --> 00:43:59.389]  You've got 66 minutes of extras, the best highlights of the 9-11 Neocon Symposium, with a four-camera professional shoot from Los Angeles.
[00:43:59.429 --> 00:44:02.071]  The best highlights of the conference that C-SPAN covered.
[00:44:02.591 --> 00:44:04.252]  But a lot of it is stuff you didn't see on C-SPAN.
[00:44:04.292 --> 00:44:08.735]  It was a two-day symposium, and C-SPAN only covered an hour and 50 minutes.
[00:44:10.636 --> 00:44:12.538]  And, of course, in the film itself...
[00:44:14.397 --> 00:44:18.619]  And it's 113 minutes long and then there's a couple other minutes of some extras.
[00:44:19.019 --> 00:44:20.319]  It is such a great video.
[00:44:20.339 --> 00:44:22.020]  The best film I've ever produced.
[00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:24.301]  It is waking people up big time.
[00:44:24.661 --> 00:44:31.125]  Get your copy of Terror Storm now at InfoWars.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:44:31.145 --> 00:44:33.826]  Now, let me get into some of the other news.
[00:44:33.866 --> 00:44:36.767]  When I get up here and talk about
[00:44:42.759 --> 00:44:51.886]  Warren Buffett putting $31 plus billion into the Bill and Melinda Gates tax shelter, excuse me, a foundation.
[00:44:53.407 --> 00:44:56.109]  I mean, I don't just shoot my mouth off from the hip.
[00:44:57.610 --> 00:44:59.391]  I've actually studied the foundations.
[00:45:01.353 --> 00:45:05.616]  The American people were getting really mad at the robber barons who ran a bunch of monopolies
[00:45:06.454 --> 00:45:07.595]  We're good to go.
[00:45:07.855 --> 00:45:09.637]  We're good to go.
[00:45:27.931 --> 00:45:29.632]  And people were getting upset about this.
[00:45:30.212 --> 00:45:38.675]  I mean, robber barons would have a train pull up, a couple hundred troops would get off who were private, Pinkerton, in places like Colorado, and they'd just walk right up and blow toddlers' heads off.
[00:45:38.995 --> 00:45:41.136]  Ride women down, rape them, drag them to death.
[00:45:41.396 --> 00:45:43.076]  These are famous cases that happened.
[00:45:44.397 --> 00:45:45.197]  People got mad.
[00:45:45.237 --> 00:45:46.257]  They started shooting back.
[00:45:46.938 --> 00:45:48.358]  Robber barons started getting arrested.
[00:45:48.378 --> 00:45:49.779]  Grand juries started indicting them.
[00:45:50.499 --> 00:45:53.420]  And so they said, okay, we'll stop having monopolies.
[00:45:54.506 --> 00:46:16.298]  All they did is what the royalty had already done, the colonialists had already found, run by the aristocracies, run by the big monarchs through their systems, they'd already found that if they just took their flag down and put puppets in, and put front men over dummy corporations, that they could get even more power.
[00:46:16.619 --> 00:46:19.880]  But if they were up there owning everything, they'd get notice and people would see it.
[00:46:21.986 --> 00:46:23.307]  And again, it's not free market, folks.
[00:46:23.347 --> 00:46:24.568]  I'm not against free market wealth.
[00:46:25.489 --> 00:46:27.350]  These are the people that are destroying the free market.
[00:46:28.832 --> 00:46:44.985]  And so they actually engineered the 1906 Antitrust Act, just like the Federal Reserve private banks that made up the Federal Reserve actually wrote and later bragged about writing the Federal Reserve Act and sold it as if it was anti-banker, anti-banker cartel.
[00:46:45.926 --> 00:46:48.748]  And all those documents have now come out, and that's part of mainstream history.
[00:46:51.107 --> 00:46:56.430]  Edward Mandel House from Texas, from Austin, who was Woodrow Wilson's head honcho, chief of staff.
[00:46:57.671 --> 00:47:00.872]  His alter ego, as Wilson called him, wrote and bragged about that.
[00:47:02.033 --> 00:47:03.074]  So this is how they do it.
[00:47:03.534 --> 00:47:09.357]  And so once somebody gets up to being worth hundreds of billions of dollars, they go tax-free.
[00:47:10.938 --> 00:47:15.740]  And then it is sold through the media as it's a philanthropic organization.
[00:47:16.721 --> 00:47:17.081]  No.
[00:47:17.922 --> 00:47:20.423]  Bill Gates has put $30-plus billion of his money...
[00:47:22.365 --> 00:47:24.526]  Into the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[00:47:26.067 --> 00:47:30.790]  And now Warren Buffett has matched that amount, and now a bunch of other richy-riches are lining up.
[00:47:31.251 --> 00:47:31.851]  And what do they do?
[00:47:32.692 --> 00:47:44.659]  Any of the charity money they actually spend on the people is spent for eugenics and bioethics and population control reduction programs through the vaccinations and other systems.
[00:47:44.839 --> 00:47:46.260]  And they've been caught red-handed doing it.
[00:47:48.485 --> 00:47:53.189]  The rest of it will be used to position and buy up key areas of industry.
[00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:55.732]  And I see one of these articles every few weeks.
[00:47:57.173 --> 00:47:59.075]  Here it is out of the Drudge Report today.
[00:48:01.497 --> 00:48:05.340]  Bill Gates Charity Foundation finances newspaper purchases.
[00:48:06.721 --> 00:48:07.982]  And it's all going to be tax-free.
[00:48:08.003 --> 00:48:09.544]  And then you can't compete against that.
[00:48:10.962 --> 00:48:18.645]  You see, how are you going to have a newspaper that competes next to Bill Gates' newspaper when Bill Gates' newspaper sells ads, makes profits, everything?
[00:48:18.925 --> 00:48:21.807]  It just goes into his tax-free foundation.
[00:48:22.047 --> 00:48:24.048]  But only an inner club is allowed to have these.
[00:48:25.088 --> 00:48:26.689]  Don't you go try to set one of these up.
[00:48:28.590 --> 00:48:31.791]  Hell, the government's even busting up legitimate trust now.
[00:48:34.076 --> 00:48:41.600]  So, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation declares its noble mission is to bring innovations in health and learning to the global community.
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:46.602]  Yeah, they're now buying up education publishing, too.
[00:48:46.942 --> 00:48:54.106]  They're moving into that, which is another sweetheart business, where sweetheart companies are given the no-bid contracts by the state and federal government.
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:55.661]  I think we're good to go.
[00:49:12.663 --> 00:49:15.524]  I thought this foundation was all about starving kids.
[00:49:15.984 --> 00:49:16.944]  Well, it is mainly.
[00:49:16.964 --> 00:49:17.764]  I'm getting rid of them.
[00:49:18.325 --> 00:49:22.066]  Not starving newspapers mocked one Seattle insider.
[00:49:22.526 --> 00:49:22.846]  More.
[00:49:23.366 --> 00:49:29.608]  The Gates Foundation loaned an unspecified amount to Median News along with General Electric.
[00:49:30.588 --> 00:49:35.289]  General Electric busy with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation buying up the newspapers.
[00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.950]  In April...
[00:49:37.984 --> 00:49:43.952]  Median News agreed to buy four papers, including the San Jose Mercury News, which has been one of the few good papers.
[00:49:44.012 --> 00:49:44.913]  Not anymore, folks.
[00:49:44.993 --> 00:49:45.514]  Not anymore.
[00:49:47.196 --> 00:49:49.860]  Contra Costa Times, another independent one that was doing good.
[00:49:51.082 --> 00:49:53.044]  And McLatchy Co.
[00:49:53.104 --> 00:49:54.226]  for $1 billion.
[00:49:55.896 --> 00:49:56.556]  You will watch.
[00:49:56.757 --> 00:49:59.358]  You will immediately see pro-One World Government articles.
[00:49:59.698 --> 00:50:10.465]  You will never see a story again in the San Jose Mercury News headline, Colonel Says Bush Made 9-11 Happen, and then interview the colonel saying that he was forced to train hijackers before 9-11.
[00:50:12.466 --> 00:50:13.547]  Dean of the Defense Language School.
[00:50:14.007 --> 00:50:16.669]  You'll never see Dark Alliance, Gary Webb.
[00:50:16.689 --> 00:50:19.770]  Well, they already killed him, but you'll never see that in there again.
[00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:20.591]  You can just forget it.
[00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:25.863]  Media news also about California's Monterey County Herald and the St.
[00:50:25.903 --> 00:50:27.384]  Paul Pioneer Press in Minnesota.
[00:50:28.144 --> 00:50:30.126]  It is also the owner of the Denver Post.
[00:50:30.986 --> 00:50:32.247]  So, Bill Gates!
[00:50:33.188 --> 00:50:33.928]  Bill Gates!
[00:50:35.329 --> 00:50:37.250]  He just doesn't have to pay taxes anymore.
[00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:38.951]  That's the only difference.
[00:50:39.552 --> 00:50:41.473]  And then we have to sit there and look at him and his wife.
[00:50:42.717 --> 00:50:44.219]  These cagey cockroaches.
[00:50:44.659 --> 00:50:47.363]  I'm looking at a picture of them right here, smiling, everyone.
[00:50:47.443 --> 00:50:48.684]  Oh, you're so nice!
[00:50:49.685 --> 00:50:52.469]  Oh, you pay for UN shots for the children!
[00:50:52.969 --> 00:50:54.671]  And for buying up all the media!
[00:50:55.212 --> 00:50:55.452]  Oh!
[00:50:55.973 --> 00:50:57.455]  Bill Gates, save us!
[00:50:57.815 --> 00:50:59.056]  Save us, Bill Gates!
[00:51:04.361 --> 00:51:07.544]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:07.884 --> 00:51:09.826]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:10.186 --> 00:51:17.852]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.533 --> 00:51:25.578]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:25.998 --> 00:51:28.921]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:51:29.301 --> 00:51:31.623]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:51:32.063 --> 00:51:32.904]  NSA spying.
[00:51:33.348 --> 00:51:37.389]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.709 --> 00:51:41.230]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:43.591]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:43.931 --> 00:51:47.832]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.004 --> 00:52:06.087]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:52:06.147 --> 00:52:13.432]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:52:13.592 --> 00:52:24.219]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atherosine, styrene, and MTBE.
[00:52:24.439 --> 00:52:28.962]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:52:29.242 --> 00:52:34.244]  Unbelievably, they even remove small microparticulate from water like food coloring particles.
[00:52:34.444 --> 00:52:37.386]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:37.626 --> 00:52:47.210]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:52.353]  Get a two-pack for only $99 or a four-pack for only $188 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:52.453 --> 00:52:52.853]  That's 888-803-4438.

[00:53:17.452 --> 00:53:18.112]  We're good to go.
[00:53:46.989 --> 00:53:50.071]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:50.231 --> 00:53:56.176]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:01.879 --> 00:54:04.641]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:54:04.661 --> 00:54:08.544]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:10.345 --> 00:54:15.309]  Oh, we have scheduled Pat Buchanan for the show later in the week.
[00:54:16.647 --> 00:54:18.408]  His new book out, State of Emergency.
[00:54:18.828 --> 00:54:19.588]  Why didn't I think of that?
[00:54:19.608 --> 00:54:20.289]  That's a good name.
[00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:39.478]  And the same people giving you the American Union, the same people who are going to turn all your roads into toll roads, the same people that are going to put viruses on your lunch meats, they are the same ones that are getting rid of our borders and bringing in these illegal aliens.
[00:54:41.832 --> 00:54:48.958]  Who, though I have nothing against them, I have a problem with what they are doing overall to this economy and this country.
[00:54:50.999 --> 00:54:55.323]  But before I go any further, let me just finish up with a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation article.
[00:55:00.146 --> 00:55:06.151]  They are buying up most of the independent newspapers that were left in the country, like the St.
[00:55:06.191 --> 00:55:09.794]  Paul Pioneer Press and the San Jose Mercury News.
[00:55:11.374 --> 00:55:17.898]  And the Denver Post, and they're doing that with their partner, General Electric.
[00:55:17.918 --> 00:55:22.321]  I mean, ask yourselves, how gullible are the American people?
[00:55:24.243 --> 00:55:28.265]  They just hear, oh, Bill Gates gave away 30-plus billion dollars.
[00:55:28.585 --> 00:55:35.050]  Oh, his wife gave away tens of billions of dollars.
[00:55:35.070 --> 00:55:37.631]  Oh, look how sweet Warren Buffett is.
[00:55:38.092 --> 00:55:40.033]  He's given away 30-something billion dollars.
[00:55:41.002 --> 00:55:44.103]  I mean, Warren Buffett has bet against America and the dollar.
[00:55:45.104 --> 00:55:50.146]  Warren Buffett is always involved in unscrupulous activities.
[00:55:50.186 --> 00:55:58.009]  He's always involved in betting against countries and making money off horrible catastrophes and downfalls of governments.
[00:55:58.529 --> 00:56:10.374]  But now he's so sweet, he's going to give 31 plus billion dollars to a tax-free foundation.
[00:56:11.326 --> 00:56:15.453]  And if you read the details of it, Brookshire Hathaway still quote, is going to make money.
[00:56:15.993 --> 00:56:17.796]  Well, now it's just tax-free!
[00:56:17.816 --> 00:56:22.684]  I mean, how are we supposed to compete with these guys when they don't even pay taxes?
[00:56:26.633 --> 00:56:35.038]  And by the way, it is the big money corporations that actually lobby for higher taxes on the lower tax brackets.
[00:56:35.398 --> 00:56:45.143]  They then lobby for no taxes on the higher brackets because they use our tax money sucked out of us by the government to then fund them through corporate welfare.
[00:56:45.943 --> 00:56:52.507]  And the poor leftists will never figure that out in a billion trillion years.
[00:56:54.873 --> 00:56:56.514]  I mean, it's not hard to figure this out.
[00:56:59.136 --> 00:57:00.497]  Seriously, I'm sick of it.
[00:57:00.817 --> 00:57:06.861]  I'm tired of having to look at Bill and Melinda Gates on TV, smiling and everyone praising them, talking about how good they are.
[00:57:06.881 --> 00:57:09.823]  And I look at this picture of them, just sniveling smug.
[00:57:10.063 --> 00:57:10.823]  You can just tell.
[00:57:10.863 --> 00:57:15.166]  They have that look on their face like you're all a bunch of morons and we're your masters.
[00:57:17.567 --> 00:57:21.870]  They're cold, android-like little criminals.
[00:57:22.070 --> 00:57:22.971]  I mean, that's what they are.
[00:57:24.525 --> 00:57:25.926]  This is criminal what they're doing.
[00:57:26.346 --> 00:57:28.528]  Posing as philanthropic organizations.
[00:57:28.848 --> 00:57:30.710]  What do you think the Ford Foundation does?
[00:57:30.730 --> 00:57:32.671]  What do you think the Carnegie Foundation does?
[00:57:32.691 --> 00:57:36.134]  You know, the Ford Foundation is over $20 billion.
[00:57:36.674 --> 00:57:38.335]  And do you know what they do 24-7?
[00:57:38.355 --> 00:57:39.496]  Break down the family.
[00:57:41.118 --> 00:57:42.098]  Break down the borders.
[00:57:44.677 --> 00:57:54.879]  It was the Ford and Carnegie Foundations through the CIA direction that openly funded Miss Magazine and the feminist movement so they could get all the women working and break up the families.
[00:57:55.039 --> 00:57:55.799]  Declassified!
[00:57:55.999 --> 00:57:56.419]  Public!
[00:57:57.980 --> 00:58:00.520]  They worked 24-7 to break down our borders.
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:03.781]  They worked... I found the documents 40 years ago.
[00:58:04.021 --> 00:58:08.682]  The Ford Foundation paid for comic books and coloring books by the millions every year.
[00:58:09.423 --> 00:58:19.310]  And now they just pay the Mexican government to do it, to print up these things for the Mexicans down in southern Mexico and central Mexico to tell them Texas and California are reconquista.
[00:58:20.370 --> 00:58:29.136]  So, when these illegal aliens are running around with their Mexican flags telling you this is Mexico, which they've told me, just know it's the Ford Foundation taught them that.
[00:58:29.536 --> 00:58:35.620]  They may have grown up in dirt floor shacks, but they had a comic book paid for by people like Bill Gates!
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:37.161]  I hate you, Bill Gates!
[00:58:37.441 --> 00:58:38.042]  I hate you!
[00:58:41.545 --> 00:58:45.710]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:45.730 --> 00:58:45.810]  Help!
[00:58:45.830 --> 00:58:46.270]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.410 --> 00:58:47.031]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.211 --> 00:58:51.476]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:52.457 --> 00:58:54.098]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.599 --> 00:59:04.480]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:08.863]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.343 --> 00:59:13.467]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:21.773]  David Rockefeller published a, what, his third autobiography two years ago.
[00:59:23.214 --> 00:59:25.216]  And in there he says, we're setting up world government.
[00:59:26.296 --> 00:59:30.640]  There are those that accuse me of wanting to get rid of the United States, and I'm guilty as charged.
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:31.881]  We are going to dismantle the U.S.,
[00:59:33.357 --> 00:59:37.499]  And the open borders, the illegal aliens, already the majority in almost every major U.S.
[00:59:37.579 --> 00:59:44.523]  city, 60-plus percent in New York, have all openly been taught by the Ford and Carnegie Foundations that this is Mexico.
[00:59:46.444 --> 01:00:00.992]  And Melinda Gates Foundation is doing the exact same stuff, using their billions of dollars now tax-free to run private businesses for profit, buying up a handful of independent newspapers that were left in this country.
[01:00:02.739 --> 01:00:10.748]  Like the San Jose Mercury News and the Denver Post and the Minnesota Pioneer Press, they're buying them all up, and it'll be his propaganda.
[01:00:11.669 --> 01:00:13.631]  Bill Gates is now trying to take over U.S.
[01:00:13.711 --> 01:00:14.332]  education.
[01:00:16.073 --> 01:00:18.316]  It just goes on and on and on.
[01:00:19.642 --> 01:00:29.070]  Again, Carnegie, Ford, Bill and Melinda Gates, Le Pew Charitable Trust, Annenberg, CPV, all of these are set up.
[01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:36.436]  Listen, we've got the Frank Church committees, we've got other committees back in the 60s and 70s that got the documents on the tax-free foundations.
[01:00:36.456 --> 01:00:40.299]  I've interviewed Anthony Sutton and others before he died, and he worked with these people.
[01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:47.906]  They sit around board tables openly talking about how to take over the economy, how to take over our society, how to dumb you down.
[01:00:50.019 --> 01:00:55.606]  They talk about how to keep engineering wars to consolidate our economy through their hands.
[01:00:55.686 --> 01:00:57.488]  I mean, these are cold-blooded people.
[01:00:57.748 --> 01:00:59.049]  That's why they're in control.
[01:00:59.270 --> 01:01:00.571]  That's why they own everything.
[01:01:03.855 --> 01:01:06.578]  And it's time to stop being so naive.
[01:01:08.139 --> 01:01:10.242]  Look, most normal people can become happy.
[01:01:10.282 --> 01:01:11.223]  They can become wealthy.
[01:01:12.893 --> 01:01:24.780]  But you never get into elite positions without being truly ruthless because a normal person won't cut throats and stab backs and do all the bad things it takes to compete with all the other scallywags that are in power.
[01:01:26.721 --> 01:01:37.767]  There are a lot of people who make 10, 20 million, even a billion dollars, but then they basically stop there because they had a good idea, were working hard, they get fat and happy and move on in life.
[01:01:38.556 --> 01:01:39.736]  Not with the elite folks.
[01:01:39.776 --> 01:01:43.078]  They always want more, more, more, more, more.
[01:01:43.458 --> 01:01:48.779]  I know a lot of wealthy people who aren't evil, who just own businesses and live their lives out.
[01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:53.281]  And they're the first to tell you, hey, you know, Alex, I might be worth a couple hundred million dollars.
[01:01:54.501 --> 01:01:59.562]  I'm talking about one of my friends hypothetically here, but listen, I'm not in the elite.
[01:02:00.002 --> 01:02:01.383]  I'm not anywhere near the elite.
[01:02:01.403 --> 01:02:02.503]  The elite own the banks.
[01:02:02.543 --> 01:02:03.603]  The elite print the money.
[01:02:03.943 --> 01:02:09.125]  The elite found, you know, their great, great, great, great grandfathers founded the universities we attend.
[01:02:09.885 --> 01:02:11.345]  They are institutionalized.
[01:02:12.666 --> 01:02:16.947]  But you go talk to some blue-collar worker, he thinks somebody's rich who makes $100,000 a year.
[01:02:19.256 --> 01:02:25.418]  Some middle class worker who makes $100,000 a year, they think somebody who's a millionaire is rich.
[01:02:25.998 --> 01:02:29.319]  A millionaire thinks somebody who's worth $50 million is rich.
[01:02:29.799 --> 01:02:36.241]  But somebody who's worth $50 million and who's in business knows they're not even lower middle class.
[01:02:39.073 --> 01:02:51.960]  And so, we have tax-free foundations now, buying up the newspapers, buying up the TV stations, buying up the military stocks, buying up the education companies, and they're profit-driven, they're not free market, and none of us can compete with them.
[01:02:53.801 --> 01:02:59.404]  I mean, not only do the big private central banks print the money now, now their spin-off foundations are tax-free.
[01:03:01.325 --> 01:03:02.506]  Let me just give you a newsflash.
[01:03:02.866 --> 01:03:04.587]  Your free market is in the way.
[01:03:05.834 --> 01:03:07.115]  My free market's in the way.
[01:03:07.475 --> 01:03:09.337]  You see, it isn't about the free market anymore, folks.
[01:03:09.357 --> 01:03:10.938]  This is about consolidation.
[01:03:11.098 --> 01:03:12.399]  You know what privatization is?
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:22.787]  Privatization is these robber barons having the government agents they put in office, they financed, hand over what's left of the infrastructure that they don't already own to them.
[01:03:22.807 --> 01:03:33.636]  Big corporations have made the government king so that the king, the government, can license them to run monopolies.
[01:03:34.443 --> 01:03:35.744]  We're back to feudalism.
[01:03:36.044 --> 01:03:37.725]  We might as well have a king.
[01:03:37.905 --> 01:03:39.026]  It'd be better than this.
[01:03:40.106 --> 01:03:40.847]  This is sick!
[01:03:41.467 --> 01:03:42.007]  Alright, I'm sorry.
[01:03:42.027 --> 01:03:42.628]  I'm out of control.
[01:03:42.688 --> 01:03:44.689]  Our guest is with us, former British ambassador.
[01:03:45.649 --> 01:03:47.410]  We'll be talking to him on the other side of this quick break.
[01:03:55.979 --> 01:03:59.162]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:03:59.503 --> 01:04:01.404]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:01.805 --> 01:04:09.472]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.153 --> 01:04:11.935]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11
[01:04:12.679 --> 01:04:17.200]  An inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:29.003]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.323 --> 01:04:32.844]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.284 --> 01:04:35.224]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.544 --> 01:04:39.385]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:52.768 --> 01:04:53.529]  Terrorism.
[01:04:53.689 --> 01:04:54.429]  Terrorism.
[01:04:54.549 --> 01:04:55.390]  Chemical attacks.
[01:04:55.450 --> 01:04:56.131]  Dirty bombs.
[01:04:56.211 --> 01:04:56.651]  Fallout.
[01:04:56.711 --> 01:04:57.692]  Biological attack.
[01:04:57.892 --> 01:04:58.432]  Anthrax.
[01:04:58.492 --> 01:05:00.594]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:05:00.874 --> 01:05:02.476]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:05:02.716 --> 01:05:05.178]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:05:05.578 --> 01:05:20.149]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:20.189 --> 01:05:20.509]  government.
[01:05:20.670 --> 01:05:22.451]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:05:22.851 --> 01:05:28.752]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:28.892 --> 01:05:33.393]  If you're not the type who waits until it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[01:05:33.633 --> 01:05:40.355]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:05:40.415 --> 01:05:43.055]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[01:05:52.173 --> 01:05:58.177]  I used to be ashamed of my toenails, so I thought I was destined to wear tennis shoes through the heat of the summer and hide my toes at the beach.
[01:05:58.577 --> 01:06:01.239]  And then my podiatrist told me about Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:06:01.399 --> 01:06:06.022]  It tackles unsightly nails by clearing out the cause of the problem, yellowing carrots and debris buildup.
[01:06:06.182 --> 01:06:11.006]  With regular use, Non-X Gel breaks down and removes the debris, so toenails look clear.
[01:06:11.186 --> 01:06:15.929]  This summer, I'm wearing open-toed sandals again, thanks to a topical natural gel called Non-X.
[01:06:16.149 --> 01:06:18.811]  If your toenails are embarrassing, I recommend Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:06:19.051 --> 01:06:21.933]  It's at your pharmacy or mass retailer in the foot care section.
[01:06:23.213 --> 01:06:24.174]  Looking for profit?
[01:06:24.294 --> 01:06:25.694]  Looking for safety and security?
[01:06:26.014 --> 01:06:28.876]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offered both.
[01:06:29.276 --> 01:06:36.538]  This low mintage collector coin with a total series mintage under $600,000 has sold at four times its current price.
[01:06:36.899 --> 01:06:40.420]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:42.181]  Secure your position today.
[01:06:42.481 --> 01:06:43.601]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:06:43.741 --> 01:06:43.981]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:06:53.445 --> 01:06:59.090]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:08.137 --> 01:07:14.002]  Welcome back, my friends.
[01:07:14.022 --> 01:07:15.123]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:07:15.183 --> 01:07:15.903]  We're live.
[01:07:15.963 --> 01:07:17.805]  It is Monday, the 21st day of August 2006.
[01:07:21.351 --> 01:07:23.853]  We'll have open phones in the third hour.
[01:07:23.893 --> 01:07:34.442]  We've got another guest joining us in studio then, but we'll just be talking about the American Union and the Animal ID Act, just layer upon layer of tyranny coming down on us right now.
[01:07:34.462 --> 01:07:39.426]  All written by the big corporations to knock out any competition.
[01:07:40.186 --> 01:07:42.028]  And again, that's publicly available information.
[01:07:42.048 --> 01:07:47.292]  But shifting gears, former British ambassador says terror alerts are propaganda.
[01:07:47.332 --> 01:07:48.173]  That was our headline.
[01:07:49.668 --> 01:07:52.209]  His stories were picked up by several big British papers.
[01:07:52.710 --> 01:08:09.238]  The former British ambassador to Uzbekistan, Craig Murray, says the alleged transatlantic liquid bomb plot is stage-managed propaganda on behalf of Bush and Blair who yearn for a, quote, new 9-11 to absolve them of domestic political trouble.
[01:08:10.439 --> 01:08:11.520]  He's also an author.
[01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:16.302]  A new book just came out about the torture going on in Uzbekistan where the U.S.
[01:08:16.342 --> 01:08:17.603]  and British governments have a
[01:08:19.554 --> 01:08:27.120]  Real live Kim Jong-il type in control who openly boils people alive.
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:30.922]  I mean, a good old-fashioned Vlad the Impaler type.
[01:08:32.804 --> 01:08:35.806]  And I was just talking to Mr. Murray during the break when we first got him on.
[01:08:35.826 --> 01:08:39.789]  He said that his book is now being confiscated at the British airport.
[01:08:41.323 --> 01:08:44.145]  I have experienced things like this flying into Canada.
[01:08:44.225 --> 01:08:46.226]  Why do I have this book with me?
[01:08:46.266 --> 01:08:49.467]  Why do I have a news article in my bag?
[01:08:49.527 --> 01:08:53.549]  Why, people that read news articles of major newspapers are bad.
[01:08:54.089 --> 01:08:56.570]  The police are being trained to be secret police.
[01:08:57.010 --> 01:08:59.151]  Do you understand this, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:09:00.392 --> 01:09:01.272]  We're in a lot of trouble.
[01:09:01.972 --> 01:09:03.553]  We're becoming Uzbekistan.
[01:09:04.534 --> 01:09:06.955]  Ambassador Murray, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[01:09:06.975 --> 01:09:07.755]  Thank you.
[01:09:08.709 --> 01:09:22.597]  Tell us a little bit about yourself and how you woke up to what's going on, and let's get into government-sponsored terror, let's get into false flag events, let's get into busting patsies and entrapment and these different staged operations.
[01:09:24.257 --> 01:09:24.998]  Yeah.
[01:09:25.058 --> 01:09:38.105]  Well, if I start off with myself, I've been a career diplomat for 21 years, and Uzbekistan was my first posting as ambassador, and it's
[01:09:39.016 --> 01:09:44.517]  I started at the bottom and worked my way up the service until I became an ambassador.
[01:09:44.937 --> 01:09:54.559]  I went out there in the summer of 2002 and discovered one of the worst dictatorships in the world.
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:10:01.481]  It's like North Korea, it's like Burma, it's like Zimbabwe, worse than Zimbabwe.
[01:10:02.498 --> 01:10:06.641]  And as you say, dissidents are quite literally boiled to death in a couple of occasions.
[01:10:06.661 --> 01:10:09.604]  Torture's kind of on an industrial scale.
[01:10:09.624 --> 01:10:12.986]  That's how they keep the people down through fear.
[01:10:13.247 --> 01:10:15.729]  And thousands of people are tortured every year.
[01:10:15.749 --> 01:10:17.770]  I'm talking about rape with open bottles.
[01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:20.392]  I'm talking about rape of children in front of their parents.
[01:10:20.412 --> 01:10:22.834]  I'm talking about pulling out of fingernails.
[01:10:23.114 --> 01:10:27.518]  You know, I'm not talking... Oh, you're talking about the stuff Alberto Gonzalez has advocated in memos.
[01:10:27.598 --> 01:10:29.520]  Raping children in front of parents.
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:29.780]  Yes.
[01:10:30.646 --> 01:10:30.906]  Yeah.
[01:10:31.026 --> 01:10:34.469]  No, sadly, the West is letting its standards slip in torture.
[01:10:34.489 --> 01:10:38.011]  Well, I mean, you know, maybe Bush is allowed to order children to be raped.
[01:10:38.071 --> 01:10:38.932]  Maybe that's Christian.
[01:10:39.612 --> 01:10:58.065]  Well, one thing which, you know, was obviously deeply distressing to me was that I discovered that the CIA was getting intelligence from the Uzbek torture chambers and that this was being passed off as intelligence in the war on terror, that it was...
[01:10:59.136 --> 01:11:03.038]  It was people saying that Uzbek opposition people were all members of Al-Qaeda.
[01:11:03.498 --> 01:11:06.880]  In many cases, the CIA was saying they'd met bin Laden personally.
[01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:09.461]  And I knew this was rubbish.
[01:11:09.561 --> 01:11:16.805]  You know, in many instances, there were CIA reports which we knew for certain, as a British embassy, just weren't true.
[01:11:16.865 --> 01:11:21.727]  There were talk of training camps in places where we knew there physically wasn't anything.
[01:11:22.408 --> 01:11:28.771]  There was one Uzbek dissident who was named as a member of Al-Qaeda, and I actually knew the guy.
[01:11:29.437 --> 01:11:30.818]  And he was a Jehovah's Witness.
[01:11:31.719 --> 01:11:34.261]  Not many Jehovah's Witnesses in Al-Qaeda.
[01:11:35.361 --> 01:11:39.184]  So, you know, I became very, very concerned.
[01:11:39.244 --> 01:11:48.371]  And I was complaining to my own government that the CIA was getting this complete rubbish intelligence, was giving it credence, and it came from torture.
[01:11:48.911 --> 01:11:51.353]  And we raised it with the American Embassy as well.
[01:11:52.233 --> 01:11:53.554]  No one ever said to me, you're wrong.
[01:11:53.835 --> 01:11:56.256]  Nobody ever said, it doesn't come from torture.
[01:11:56.296 --> 01:11:56.577]  The U.S.
[01:11:56.617 --> 01:11:58.398]  Embassy acknowledged it came from torture.
[01:11:59.131 --> 01:11:59.671]  Thank you very much.
[01:12:25.327 --> 01:12:30.576]  Provided, this is the British government's viewpoint, provided we didn't do the torturing ourselves.
[01:12:31.298 --> 01:12:34.063]  If the Uzbeks tortured people and handed us the intelligence...
[01:12:35.345 --> 01:12:36.626]  Then that was okay.
[01:12:37.086 --> 01:13:04.502]  And that's important because we now know that at over 15 sites from Egypt in the Middle East and Jordan to areas in Eastern Europe, old gulags have been fired back up and are commanded by CIA and British MI6, but it is Eastern European torturers that are raping the children and raping people with bottles and electrodes and the rest of it.
[01:13:05.433 --> 01:13:05.933]  That's right.
[01:13:06.494 --> 01:13:10.976]  And that's the Council of Europe report, which was done by Dick Marty.
[01:13:11.136 --> 01:13:27.804]  And there's been a lot of attempts to rubbish Dick Marty, but he's not only a respected Swedish senator, he's a respected Swedish judge of long standing, and a judge who has presided in terrorist trials and handed down long sentences to terrorists, so he knows what he's talking about.
[01:13:28.311 --> 01:13:31.334]  He did the report for the Council of Europe on extraordinary rendition.
[01:13:31.915 --> 01:13:39.723]  He set all this out and he included Uzbekistan as one of the places where the CIA takes people for extraordinary rendition.
[01:13:39.783 --> 01:13:40.804]  I think that's fairly well.
[01:13:41.448 --> 01:13:43.990]  Now, Ambassador, we know this is still ongoing.
[01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:53.238]  We're talking to the former British ambassador to Uzbekistan, one of the worst sites of human rights abuses in the world, and he broke it and tried to stop it valiantly.
[01:13:54.278 --> 01:14:02.245]  From the intelligence you've got and the sources you still have in government, we know this is still going on, I've read, but is it better than it was or is it worse than it was?
[01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:08.382]  Do you mean the extraordinary rendition program and use of torture?
[01:14:08.442 --> 01:14:13.724]  Yeah, I mean torture from, say, Jordan to Uzbekistan.
[01:14:14.404 --> 01:14:15.685]  I mean, that's really not changed.
[01:14:17.845 --> 01:14:30.071]  The only thing that... A few things have changed, and they're being very careful, for example, because it caused such a fuss in Europe, they're being very careful not to touch down planes in European countries that might make trouble.
[01:14:30.331 --> 01:14:31.071]  So they've had to...
[01:14:31.801 --> 01:14:37.683]  This must be a huge operation if the government ran out of aircraft and was renting the Red Sox plane to fly Americans out.
[01:14:37.723 --> 01:14:42.584]  Any idea on how many people have been secretly grabbed out of Europe, out of Italy, out of the U.S.? ?
[01:14:58.434 --> 01:15:01.175]  Frankly, it's very, very difficult to know numbers.
[01:15:01.715 --> 01:15:06.337]  I think we're probably talking in the low hundreds, probably not many more than that.
[01:15:08.198 --> 01:15:11.180]  Nobody knows is the real answer to that question.
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:15.502]  And there are an extraordinary number of people.
[01:15:17.303 --> 01:15:19.324]  Well, we know the CIA is in trouble.
[01:15:20.124 --> 01:15:25.827]  We know the CIA ambassador is in trouble in Italy for grabbing a bunch of people illegally to go take him to torture.
[01:15:26.368 --> 01:15:29.309]  Yes, that's right.
[01:15:29.589 --> 01:15:33.790]  In Italy, at least one person was simply kidnapped off the streets.
[01:15:33.810 --> 01:15:36.450]  The same thing also happened in Germany.
[01:15:37.631 --> 01:15:50.374]  In Sweden, the Swedish authorities handed people over at the airport completely illegally, and there's nothing in Swedish law about them to do that to the CIA, but people were then banned and forcibly drugged and bundled on an airplane.
[01:15:50.394 --> 01:15:50.994]  There's a lot of
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:54.580]  Illegal activity behind it.
[01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:56.321]  I mean, a German case is interesting.
[01:15:56.361 --> 01:16:00.382]  The poor man disappeared off the street and didn't reappear for another two years.
[01:16:00.522 --> 01:16:02.962]  And his family had no idea what had happened to him.
[01:16:03.142 --> 01:16:05.543]  They had no idea where he went.
[01:16:05.703 --> 01:16:08.404]  They didn't know the Americans had got him.
[01:16:09.184 --> 01:16:11.625]  They thought he deserted his family and absconded.
[01:16:11.665 --> 01:16:13.545]  They were desperate, you know.
[01:16:14.345 --> 01:16:16.026]  He turned out to be completely innocent.
[01:16:16.066 --> 01:16:17.426]  It was a case of mistaken identity.
[01:16:17.446 --> 01:16:21.467]  It took them two years to work that out after he'd been initially in...
[01:16:27.001 --> 01:16:30.363]  Amazing.
[01:16:30.443 --> 01:16:40.608]  Shifting gears now, Mr. Murray, for those that don't know about the whole soap opera that you were involved in, you come back to England and they say, well, this is our policy.
[01:16:40.668 --> 01:16:42.028]  We let them torture for us.
[01:16:42.569 --> 01:16:43.849]  What then happened after that?
[01:16:43.889 --> 01:16:46.831]  Because this leads us into the latest terror alerts.
[01:16:47.571 --> 01:16:47.751]  Yeah.
[01:16:48.191 --> 01:16:51.413]  Well, after that, I was trying to
[01:16:52.447 --> 01:16:54.689]  Persuade them to change their mind.
[01:16:55.130 --> 01:16:58.833]  And there were things I didn't know at the time that I subsequently discovered.
[01:17:00.534 --> 01:17:09.162]  What I couldn't get my head around at the time is why the CIA and the American and British governments wanted this intelligence when they knew it wasn't true.
[01:17:09.943 --> 01:17:14.206]  And I was saying, look, you've got all this intelligence about Al-Qaeda camps.
[01:17:14.266 --> 01:17:16.368]  Physically, they don't exist.
[01:17:16.769 --> 01:17:18.230]  We've been to the spot.
[01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:19.251]  There is nothing there.
[01:17:19.868 --> 01:17:21.290]  And yet they wanted the intelligence.
[01:17:21.370 --> 01:17:22.371]  They said it helped them.
[01:17:23.092 --> 01:17:25.954]  They said it was operationally useful to them.
[01:17:28.117 --> 01:17:28.937]  But it was untrue.
[01:17:29.578 --> 01:17:35.924]  Well, it's useful so we can have... Well, sure, I mean, it's useful so we can have... Fox News alert!
[01:17:36.325 --> 01:17:41.810]  Intelligence out of Uzbekistan says that Ahmed Rabubu was about to blow up the Sears Tower.
[01:17:42.030 --> 01:17:43.292]  We're taking all of your rights!
[01:17:46.429 --> 01:17:49.591]  Anything was welcome to them, which exaggerated the threat of Al-Qaeda.
[01:17:49.931 --> 01:17:50.831]  But there's more to that.
[01:17:51.491 --> 01:17:59.835]  One of the reasons they wanted that as well was it justified all the support the American taxpayer was giving to the Karimov regime.
[01:18:00.235 --> 01:18:11.961]  And to give an example, in 2002 alone, American taxpayers gave over $500 million to Uzbekistan, and not that $120 million was in aid to the Uzbek military, and over $80 million was
[01:18:12.682 --> 01:18:16.286]  Was an aid to the Uzbek security services for people who were boiling people to death.
[01:18:17.126 --> 01:18:20.590]  But why would America want to support such a dictator?
[01:18:21.050 --> 01:18:22.752]  And the answer to that, you have to go back to 1997.
[01:18:22.792 --> 01:18:25.715]  And in 1997, Ken Lay of Enron wrote a letter to George Bush
[01:18:35.987 --> 01:18:36.467]  Stay there.
[01:18:36.547 --> 01:18:36.868]  Stay there.
[01:18:36.888 --> 01:18:37.848]  We've got to stop right there.
[01:18:37.908 --> 01:18:39.609]  Ambassador, it's so good to have you on.
[01:18:39.649 --> 01:18:41.250]  We appreciate your courage.
[01:18:41.290 --> 01:18:44.412]  A very important window into this very dark world.

[01:19:54.978 --> 01:19:58.640]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:19:59.841 --> 01:20:04.664]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum, and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:20:04.884 --> 01:20:07.606]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:20:07.646 --> 01:20:08.786]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:20:10.107 --> 01:20:14.710]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:20:15.612 --> 01:20:22.898]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.

[01:20:53.301 --> 01:20:55.762]  David J. Smith for News Watch Magazine.
[01:20:55.782 --> 01:21:05.065]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Acts number 1 and 2 is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[01:21:06.045 --> 01:21:10.967]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 14th Amendments?
[01:21:12.023 --> 01:21:13.864]  This is minimum infringement.
[01:21:14.244 --> 01:21:15.065]  There may be more.
[01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:23.028]  Is your guaranteed right to freedom of speech, assembly, religion, privacy, and to own a gun important to you?

[01:21:52.956 --> 01:21:55.138]  By now, it is no surprise that the U.S.
[01:21:55.218 --> 01:22:00.803]  ranks 37th in the world in occurrence of chronic illness, according to the World Health Organization.
[01:22:01.004 --> 01:22:05.708]  Due to modern farming and food processing practices, our food supply has become nutritive.

[01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:31.102]  We are looking for people who are serious about bettering their lives and the lives of the people they love.
[01:22:31.242 --> 01:22:32.602]  Better health is possible.

[01:22:36.063 --> 01:22:38.763]  You have the right to decide what is attainable in your lifetime.
[01:22:38.823 --> 01:22:40.584]  And you have the right to good health.
[01:23:03.971 --> 01:23:08.496]  Pakistan, of course, has been controlled by the British for over 100 years.
[01:23:08.976 --> 01:23:09.677]  Now the U.S.
[01:23:09.717 --> 01:23:12.319]  has moved in with the dictator, Musharraf.
[01:23:14.441 --> 01:23:15.883]  They rule with an iron fist.
[01:23:15.983 --> 01:23:23.330]  You have Pakistani intelligence supposedly funding the 9-11 hijackers, clearly involved in U.S.
[01:23:23.630 --> 01:23:24.351]  operations.
[01:23:25.012 --> 01:23:25.792]  And it's the same thing.
[01:23:25.832 --> 01:23:28.395]  Every time there's some bust in England, it's funding out of
[01:23:29.975 --> 01:23:30.555]  We're good to go.
[01:23:30.575 --> 01:23:31.075]  I think?
[01:23:54.176 --> 01:23:58.879]  And finally paid off $50,000 to say they were with al-Qaeda.
[01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:00.721]  And then that's the big national threat.
[01:24:01.301 --> 01:24:02.502]  Going back to the ambassador.
[01:24:02.582 --> 01:24:22.016]  Ambassador, so the main point you're getting at here, and if you can elaborate on it, is that they want the Uzbekistan dictatorship to torture to basically continue to give them fake intelligence of al-Qaeda networks existing when it doesn't exist in that area, much less the rest of the world.
[01:24:23.408 --> 01:24:24.309]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:24:24.389 --> 01:24:27.451]  And the basic reason they wanted to do it was they wanted to get at the oil and gas.
[01:24:28.252 --> 01:24:47.465]  I was saying just before we broke, and it's an important point, so I'll sort of finish it off, I think, was that back in 97, Ken Lay of Enron arranged a meeting for George Bush while George Bush was governor of Texas with the Uzbek ambassador.
[01:24:48.786 --> 01:24:52.329]  And I'll just read you two sentences from his letter.
[01:24:53.387 --> 01:24:55.028]  Which you'll find in my book.
[01:24:55.088 --> 01:24:59.770]  It's from Ken Lay, writing on the 3rd of April 1997 to George Bush.
[01:25:00.650 --> 01:25:06.853]  It says, You will be meeting with Ambassador Sadiq Safire, Uzbekistan's ambassador to the United States, on April the 8th.
[01:25:08.734 --> 01:25:22.320]  Enron has established an office in Tashkent, and we are negotiating a $2 billion joint venture with Nefti Gas of Uzbekistan to develop Uzbekistan's natural gas and transport it to markets in Europe and Turkey.
[01:25:23.366 --> 01:25:32.890]  And he finishes up saying, I trust you and Ambassador Zafiyev will have a productive meeting which will result in a friendship between Texas and Uzbekistan.
[01:25:33.571 --> 01:25:52.479]  So what you've really got happening is, you know, oil and gas business with the gruesome dictatorship going on under the surface, while on top, the official reason is all to do with fighting al-Qaeda, and they have to invent the al-Qaeda threat in order to justify the actual economic purpose.
[01:25:53.695 --> 01:26:01.057]  Which is USAID predominantly is just a payoff to a dictator to drive around in Rolls Royces and fly around in helicopters.
[01:26:01.817 --> 01:26:17.320]  Yeah, and the interesting thing is that the American taxpayer was giving amounts of money which were worth pretty well as much as the oil and gas revenue because the people who get the oil and gas revenue are people who manage not to pay taxes.
[01:26:19.227 --> 01:26:21.969]  So it was a fairly disgusting thing.
[01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:27.134]  Interestingly, what goes around comes around, and backing a dictator is seldom a good idea in the long term.
[01:26:27.634 --> 01:26:35.761]  Ultimately, after Engel went bust, Karimov was playing the field, and in the end he got a very large payoff.
[01:26:35.781 --> 01:26:44.609]  It was about $88 million paid to his daughter from Gazprom of Russia, and last year turned around and kicked the Americans out.
[01:26:45.818 --> 01:26:55.080]  So after these years of cooperation and giving him money, he turned around and changed his mind.
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:27:05.563]  But at least he still runs rape rooms, the fantasy of the Attorney General, and they torture people and do stuff to little kids, and that's what's important to Bush, so he still gets his fake intelligence.
[01:27:05.843 --> 01:27:12.724]  What about the Times of London headline about how Bush is now openly talking about just putting a dictator in charge in Iraq?
[01:27:13.805 --> 01:27:15.125]  Yeah, that's a
[01:27:15.603 --> 01:27:20.711]  A fascinating thing that they're talking of abandoning the democracy project because it doesn't work.
[01:27:21.692 --> 01:27:25.298]  Meaning, I think, that they don't when people get the chance to vote, they don't
[01:27:25.994 --> 01:27:30.538]  Well, I mean, that's it.
[01:27:30.578 --> 01:27:36.503]  Our government helped put Saddam in, they took him out, now they put the Ba'athists back in, and now they're just setting up the same thing.
[01:27:36.563 --> 01:27:43.448]  It's shameful for all these phony neocons on talk radio saying, we did what we did in Iraq for freedom and democracy.
[01:27:43.828 --> 01:27:45.470]  That is just a load of baloney.
[01:27:46.290 --> 01:27:49.293]  And that's exactly what I was saying while I was ambassador to Uzbekistan.
[01:27:50.154 --> 01:27:54.217]  I sent a formal diplomatic telegram back to London saying,
[01:27:54.577 --> 01:27:58.799]  You know, we're now going to war in Iraq, ostensibly to remove a dictator.
[01:27:59.199 --> 01:28:01.840]  At the same time, we're funding and backing a dictator here.
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:07.862]  Well, how can you... When we're accused of double standards, that's right.
[01:28:08.722 --> 01:28:09.102]  And it's true.
[01:28:09.162 --> 01:28:19.826]  I mean, if you try to explain American foreign policy, as followed by Tony Blair as well, you try to explain it in terms of democracy, the notion, you get no sense at all.
[01:28:19.886 --> 01:28:21.427]  If you try to explain it by...
[01:28:22.091 --> 01:28:26.452]  In terms of seizing hydrocarbon resources, then it's consistent.
[01:28:26.492 --> 01:28:35.274]  They'll adopt, in each country, from country to country, the policy which best enables them to get at those oil and gas contracts.
[01:28:35.294 --> 01:28:36.495]  Well, stay there, Ambassador.
[01:28:36.595 --> 01:28:38.135]  We'll be back after a quick break.
[01:28:38.455 --> 01:28:40.476]  And I want to talk about these fake terror alerts.
[01:28:42.896 --> 01:28:43.836]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.297 --> 01:28:45.917]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.837 --> 01:28:49.518]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.144 --> 01:28:54.964]  Come on, Bill.
[01:28:55.204 --> 01:29:00.365]  Two weeks ago you were riding the bicycle, and today you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[01:29:00.705 --> 01:29:02.186]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[01:29:02.286 --> 01:29:04.266]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[01:29:04.546 --> 01:29:10.067]  What I did do is visit the website www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[01:29:10.347 --> 01:29:16.608]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[01:29:16.929 --> 01:29:19.129]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[01:29:19.409 --> 01:29:22.851]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week.
[01:29:23.091 --> 01:29:23.531]  Whoa.
[01:29:23.891 --> 01:29:25.112]  What was that website again?
[01:29:25.172 --> 01:29:28.654]  It's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[01:29:28.954 --> 01:29:30.074]  Now write this down, John.
[01:29:30.214 --> 01:29:34.516]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[01:29:34.676 --> 01:29:35.257]  Thanks, Bill.
[01:29:35.517 --> 01:29:36.717]  I'm going there right now.
[01:29:37.138 --> 01:29:37.758]  Check, please.
[01:29:39.545 --> 01:29:41.008]  Uh, you got this one, right Bill?
[01:29:41.489 --> 01:29:42.090]  Sure, John.
[01:29:42.331 --> 01:29:46.700]  Don't forget, it's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[01:29:47.001 --> 01:29:48.705]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[01:29:48.865 --> 01:29:49.126]  Deal.

[01:30:44.655 --> 01:30:53.583]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:30:53.703 --> 01:30:56.065]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[01:30:56.125 --> 01:31:03.211]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote-unquote.
[01:31:03.792 --> 01:31:05.974]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:31:06.736 --> 01:31:08.297]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[01:31:36.764 --> 01:31:37.045]  U.S.
[01:31:37.125 --> 01:31:40.069]  debt bubble, red alert, and real estate crash.
[01:31:41.010 --> 01:31:48.861]  Call 888-8XANADU, that's 888-8XANADU, and ask for George.
[01:32:02.083 --> 01:32:13.786]  Former British Ambassador to Uzbekistan, Craig Murray, joins us.
[01:32:15.166 --> 01:32:21.387]  I want to ask you just what Uzbekistan itself is like, kind of like the armpit of the world, and what those poor people are like.
[01:32:21.427 --> 01:32:24.468]  I've seen a few documentaries about it and talked to others that have been there.
[01:32:24.548 --> 01:32:30.829]  Just the oppression, the way the soldiers and troops just strut around the police, the way the people just grovel.
[01:32:32.630 --> 01:32:37.492]  To see America beginning to turn towards that, it's just so sad, folks.
[01:32:37.572 --> 01:32:41.494]  So sad to see a once free country, land of the free, home of the brave.
[01:32:41.534 --> 01:32:42.935]  They meant that when they talked about us.
[01:32:43.355 --> 01:32:45.616]  Now land of the coward, home of the scum.
[01:32:46.396 --> 01:32:56.840]  I mean, when we support a government that openly says in memos that they can torture children in front of their parents sexually, that's the White House memo by John Yoo.
[01:32:56.860 --> 01:32:59.101]  I mean, folks, we're talking about raping children now.
[01:33:00.049 --> 01:33:03.571]  And so when any of you sign on to the Neocon agenda, you just signed on to that.
[01:33:03.591 --> 01:33:10.835]  And I want to talk about the courage of the ambassador here in a moment and how he had the courage, knowing he was dealing with people like this, to go public.
[01:33:11.275 --> 01:33:12.236]  Because it is dangerous.
[01:33:12.256 --> 01:33:21.741]  But before we do that, coming up this weekend in Dallas, from 7 at night until 2 in the morning, I'm going to show my new film, Terror Storm.
[01:33:21.761 --> 01:33:22.561]  Then I'll give a speech.
[01:33:22.621 --> 01:33:25.263]  Then Jim Mars will give a speech titled...
[01:33:26.485 --> 01:33:27.186]  We're good to go.
[01:33:46.762 --> 01:33:48.042]  By Friday or so.
[01:33:48.082 --> 01:33:49.563]  Looks like it's barely going to sell out.
[01:33:50.083 --> 01:33:51.644]  Don't wait, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:51.784 --> 01:33:52.724]  Get your tickets now.
[01:33:52.764 --> 01:33:56.065]  Go to InfoWars.com to get your e-ticket or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:33:56.745 --> 01:33:57.385]  Again, that's 888-253-3139.
[01:33:57.485 --> 01:34:02.687]  And it's the same website, the same toll-free number to get my new film, Terror Storm.
[01:34:10.896 --> 01:34:12.517]  It is available on DVD.
[01:34:13.358 --> 01:34:21.643]  66 minutes of extras from the 9-11 Neocon Agenda Symposium that we have with world-renowned experts out in California in late June.
[01:34:22.103 --> 01:34:24.185]  The almost two-hour film I produce.
[01:34:24.205 --> 01:34:34.692]  It is the best documentary I have ever made covering the history of government-sponsored terrorism, covering false flag events, covering fake terror alerts from 7-7 right through to 9-11.
[01:34:36.773 --> 01:34:45.777]  You need to have Terror Storm, again, available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[01:34:56.980 --> 01:34:57.461]  We're good to go.
[01:34:57.481 --> 01:34:57.661]  I think?
[01:35:12.722 --> 01:35:12.802]  Yeah.
[01:35:12.822 --> 01:35:13.283]  Well, it's...
[01:35:40.623 --> 01:35:55.668]  It's really very worrying the extent that the government uses terror alerts and seem to time them wonderfully for moments when politically they're in trouble.
[01:35:56.749 --> 01:36:05.252]  This latest one in London, the people involved have allegedly been under surveillance for months and months and months.
[01:36:06.176 --> 01:36:12.422]  And there does seem a good reason to suspect that they could have outed this at any stage.
[01:36:13.103 --> 01:36:17.947]  There is nothing that points to any opposition being imminent.
[01:36:18.027 --> 01:36:22.031]  None of the suspects had even bought a plane ticket yet.
[01:36:22.171 --> 01:36:23.373]  And they were all under surveillance.
[01:36:24.734 --> 01:36:27.917]  So assuming, let's assume that these are people
[01:36:28.567 --> 01:36:32.789]  Who were thinking of trying to conduct some sort of terror campaign.
[01:36:33.249 --> 01:36:35.149]  And there are all kinds of other issues there.
[01:36:35.210 --> 01:36:40.091]  For example, agile provocateur issues, because they had been penetrated, as the intelligence service said.
[01:36:40.451 --> 01:36:44.753]  But let's, anyway, let's assume that these were guys who were thinking of doing something.
[01:36:46.394 --> 01:36:57.838]  It does seem that they've been under surveillance for a long, long while, and that the government, and we know that Tony Bush, sorry, Tony Blair, Tony Bush is a good attitude, that Tony Blair and George Bush
[01:36:58.464 --> 01:37:03.886]  Discussed the arrests on the Sunday and on the Wednesday before they happened.
[01:37:04.346 --> 01:37:07.867]  Now then, you know, arrests should be an operational matter for the security services.
[01:37:08.207 --> 01:37:10.588]  Should have nothing to do at all with politicians.
[01:37:12.209 --> 01:37:16.050]  And so they time it for Lieberman had just lost his election.
[01:37:16.410 --> 01:37:19.411]  We were seeing dead children in the Lebanon on television every day.
[01:37:19.451 --> 01:37:21.632]  The public were getting sick and tired of the war on terror.
[01:37:21.672 --> 01:37:24.173]  Things were going badly in Iraq, in the UK.
[01:37:25.166 --> 01:37:35.573]  A junior government minister had just resigned the day before the arrests in protest at using UK airports to ship bombs and missiles to Israel.
[01:37:35.693 --> 01:37:46.119]  120 members of Parliament had just called for Parliament to be recalled for its summer break to protest at our policy on supporting George Bush over not calling for a ceasefire in Lebanon.
[01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:51.763]  So, you know, these were dodgy times politically.
[01:37:52.296 --> 01:38:05.522]  And immediately with this terror alert, ever since, I don't know about over there, but here, because they came out and said this was a new 9-11, this was bigger than 9-11, that this was mass murder on an unimaginable scale.
[01:38:05.542 --> 01:38:09.164]  Bigger than the Blitz!
[01:38:09.404 --> 01:38:10.304]  Bigger than the Blitz!
[01:38:10.384 --> 01:38:11.405]  It's worse than Hitler.
[01:38:11.445 --> 01:38:13.205]  We've never faced so much evil.
[01:38:14.026 --> 01:38:14.526]  Exactly.
[01:38:14.846 --> 01:38:17.707]  This ridiculous amount of complete hype.
[01:38:18.128 --> 01:38:18.648]  I mean, let's...
[01:38:19.454 --> 01:38:23.478]  It has to make you suspicious as to whether this is genuinely a law enforcement operation.
[01:38:41.471 --> 01:38:42.091]  Well, exactly.
[01:38:42.111 --> 01:38:54.259]  And they're saying, let's give up our whole way of lives, scrap the Bill of Rights, the Magna Carta, worship police in black masks, just totally give in to everything, have cameras in our bathrooms, or Al-Qaeda is going to get us.
[01:38:54.899 --> 01:38:57.120]  And then we look at Miami, stage terror event.
[01:38:57.160 --> 01:38:58.861]  We look at Toronto, stage terror event.
[01:38:59.242 --> 01:39:00.602]  We look at 7-7.
[01:39:01.083 --> 01:39:05.125]  We've got the head of the bombers being known, MI6, protected asset.
[01:39:05.145 --> 01:39:07.346]  It even comes out on television here in the U.S.
[01:39:07.787 --> 01:39:08.067]  And then...
[01:39:09.053 --> 01:39:14.598]  We have these guys without bombs, without materials, with no know-how, and they're handlers.
[01:39:14.979 --> 01:39:17.021]  Now the evidence has come out in mainstream news.
[01:39:17.401 --> 01:39:19.623]  Our Pakistan slash CIA.
[01:39:19.964 --> 01:39:25.008]  So what you've got clearly is another provocateur op, but they could never get them to actually carry it out.
[01:39:25.409 --> 01:39:25.749]  Now it's...
[01:39:27.589 --> 01:39:38.015]  ...begun to come out in the media that MI6 wanted to, quote, wait until they'd actually bomb something, and that they were being spurred to do it, but nothing ever, thank God, happened.
[01:39:38.055 --> 01:39:41.397]  I mean, this is too ridiculously obvious.
[01:39:41.417 --> 01:39:49.142]  I think, to be fair to MI6, I don't think the insinuation was they wanted to wait until they'd bomb something.
[01:39:49.182 --> 01:39:55.446]  I think the insinuation was they wanted to wait until they'd at least made a bomb and bought a plane ticket, at which stage they might have moved in.
[01:39:56.481 --> 01:40:04.707]  But the news reported that the raid they wanted to have was going to be three days after the supposed launch date.
[01:40:05.488 --> 01:40:06.469]  Yeah.
[01:40:06.529 --> 01:40:11.712]  Well, we'll never know the truth of it because, of course, the thing never went that far.
[01:40:11.752 --> 01:40:23.441]  But the implication that the actual timing of when they decided, you know, that they timed it to appear when they really needed to shift the news agenda looks to me pretty solid.
[01:40:24.330 --> 01:40:25.552]  I think we're good to go.
[01:40:41.645 --> 01:40:46.749]  The allegation that the Muslims were making the toxin ricin in a flat in North London.
[01:40:46.769 --> 01:40:48.350]  And it turned out that was all made up.
[01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:49.471]  There was no ricin.
[01:40:49.931 --> 01:40:54.495]  And then they also planted in Afghanistan ricin plants.
[01:40:55.656 --> 01:40:55.856]  Yeah.
[01:40:56.296 --> 01:40:59.238]  And in the end, everyone was found not guilty.
[01:40:59.298 --> 01:41:07.622]  But of course, at the time the plot was announced, for at least a week, it was stunt page news every day, how these people were going to kill us all with Dyson.
[01:41:08.122 --> 01:41:11.384]  When they were actually acquitted at court nine months later...
[01:41:12.017 --> 01:41:24.467]  That made it onto page 28, you know, and in fact the majority of people in the UK still actually think there was a rice and pot, because they saw all the propaganda, all the headlines... No, exactly, a year from now... ...hardly actually covered the fact that they were all found not guilty.
[01:41:25.047 --> 01:41:26.589]  Well, exactly.
[01:41:26.629 --> 01:41:31.152]  That's the danger with this stuff, that there's very often more hype and propaganda to it.
[01:41:31.212 --> 01:41:35.636]  Now, I don't know what these people were planning to do.
[01:41:35.856 --> 01:41:35.956]  I'm...
[01:41:38.100 --> 01:41:43.068]  And that will... The truth of it will come out one day in the court process.
[01:41:43.448 --> 01:41:49.377]  But what I'm deeply, deeply suspicious of is the political use to which it's being put and the political timing of it.
[01:41:50.899 --> 01:41:52.942]  Well, Ambassador, the point I was going to make is that
[01:41:55.050 --> 01:41:56.271]  It fits exactly.
[01:41:56.331 --> 01:42:05.940]  The way it was announced, how they had agents in there, how they knew what was going on, how they just basically created the group out of picking some people off some chat rooms that were shooting their mouths off.
[01:42:06.581 --> 01:42:17.590]  It fits the pattern of every other instance we've seen, except for some of the even worse cases where the government will bust one of their agents in Pakistan or Afghanistan or London.
[01:42:17.610 --> 01:42:19.072]  There's been a bunch of cases.
[01:42:20.056 --> 01:42:31.199]  Or in New York City, and then a month later in the back of the paper, it goes, oh, they were really a CIA asset or agent, and the bust in the terror alert was a cover to bring him back in.
[01:42:31.579 --> 01:42:36.301]  I mean, we've had a few cases of that where it's totally fake, and they have to admit it's fake.
[01:42:37.101 --> 01:42:37.301]  Yeah.
[01:42:37.641 --> 01:42:40.842]  Well, we'll, as I say, we will see what comes.
[01:42:40.882 --> 01:42:42.443]  But you're quite right.
[01:42:42.623 --> 01:42:43.183]  A lot of the...
[01:42:44.196 --> 01:42:56.583]  Apparently this group were penetrated by both British and Pakistani intelligence agents, and there's several similar examples recently to make you wonder whether there's actual provocateur stuff on here.
[01:42:57.043 --> 01:43:03.487]  Also, a lot of the intelligence which apparently on the group which came out of Pakistan, there are two questions here.
[01:43:03.507 --> 01:43:05.128]  Firstly, was it obtained under torture?
[01:43:05.608 --> 01:43:13.773]  And from my experience, my 21 years of diplomatic experience, my experience of dealing with exactly these issues, almost certainly that came from torture, and people will say,
[01:43:14.515 --> 01:43:15.576]  I don't think so.
[01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:44.233]  And that murder, which he may or may not have had anything to do with, but he left the country and is wanted for questioning in this country about it.
[01:43:44.653 --> 01:43:49.394]  That murder had nothing to do with Al-Qaeda, nothing to do with politics, nothing to do with terrorism, as far as anyone knows.
[01:43:49.434 --> 01:43:50.875]  There's no insinuation anywhere.
[01:43:51.573 --> 01:44:05.019]  Well, that's the point, is that they're framing, we know the White House and 10 Downing Street, we have the White House and the Downing Street memos, where they're talking about framing intelligence, they're talking about false intelligence, they're talking about lying to people.
[01:44:05.079 --> 01:44:07.620]  We know they're doing this over and over again.
[01:44:08.021 --> 01:44:10.642]  Now I want to shift gears back to courage.
[01:44:11.523 --> 01:44:13.925]  What made you decide to go public?
[01:44:14.245 --> 01:44:15.406]  Why did you go public?
[01:44:15.566 --> 01:44:21.071]  What repercussions have you seen for going public exposing the Uzbekistan torture, the Uzbek torture?
[01:44:21.711 --> 01:44:24.714]  And then just tell us about what Uzbekistan is like.
[01:44:25.794 --> 01:44:26.595]  Yeah.
[01:44:28.276 --> 01:44:32.820]  Well, I'll do the first bit, the second bit first.
[01:44:33.380 --> 01:44:34.001]  Uzbekistan...
[01:44:34.474 --> 01:44:40.938]  It's a lovely country with lovely people and a lot of great historical cities in it, like Samarkand and Tashkent and Hever.
[01:44:41.338 --> 01:44:47.382]  But the people live under the most terrible, crushed system of fear.
[01:44:47.402 --> 01:44:51.484]  Most of them are working as slave laborers, in effect, on cotton plantations.
[01:44:51.964 --> 01:44:53.545]  They have an internal visa system.
[01:44:53.565 --> 01:44:57.607]  So if you're born on a cotton plantation, you can't leave it without a visa.
[01:44:57.768 --> 01:45:01.950]  And you'll never get the visa if you're a cotton worker, because they want to keep the cotton workers on the farms.
[01:45:03.131 --> 01:45:05.854]  And also, you know, you have to guide the police a lot to get a visa.
[01:45:06.054 --> 01:45:06.814]  Let me stop you.
[01:45:06.895 --> 01:45:07.575]  Let me stop you.
[01:45:07.595 --> 01:45:09.797]  We're moving towards an internal visa system.
[01:45:09.857 --> 01:45:17.363]  Congressman Ron Paul has said with the new national ID card they passed in 2005 goes into effect in the next two years at the state level.
[01:45:18.024 --> 01:45:19.485]  And you'll have to have it to have a job.
[01:45:19.525 --> 01:45:20.445]  You'll have to have it to live.
[01:45:20.465 --> 01:45:21.426]  You'll have to have it to travel.
[01:45:21.666 --> 01:45:25.169]  And they're saying even bad credit is going to keep us from flying.
[01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:28.452]  So we're already with no fly list seeing the beginning of an internal visa.
[01:45:28.992 --> 01:45:29.633]  That's a bullet.
[01:45:30.359 --> 01:45:34.962]  Just like your books can't get out of the airport now, but sorry, go ahead.
[01:45:35.042 --> 01:45:40.326]  Yeah, no, the cotton workers get paid $2 a month.
[01:45:41.927 --> 01:45:42.228]  $2 a month.
[01:45:42.288 --> 01:45:48.592]  For that, they work 70 hours a week, 12 hours a day, 6 days a week.
[01:45:48.612 --> 01:45:49.273]  $2 a month they get.
[01:45:49.573 --> 01:45:52.695]  That's 60% of the population, and these are state farms.
[01:45:52.775 --> 01:45:53.716]  They're compelled to work there.
[01:45:53.736 --> 01:45:57.599]  Children as young as 8 in harvest time are sent out to pick cotton in the field.
[01:45:58.359 --> 01:45:59.200]  It's an appalling country.
[01:46:00.279 --> 01:46:18.722]  It seemed to me when I was there that any decent person, nothing to do with being a hero or brave or anything, I couldn't see how anyone who comes from the British or American tradition of respect for rights and that kind of thing wouldn't be against it.
[01:46:18.762 --> 01:46:26.844]  It seemed to me that when I found out this terrible torture was happening, my single duty was to try and stop it.
[01:46:27.024 --> 01:46:28.344]  That's what I had to do.
[01:46:28.987 --> 01:46:38.388]  And then when I found that my own government and the American government were actually supporting the torture and in favour of it and getting the intelligence from it, I was massively...
[01:46:39.116 --> 01:46:39.656]  Disillusioned.
[01:46:40.057 --> 01:46:42.838]  Ambassador, how do you think our government's gotten to the point?
[01:46:42.878 --> 01:46:46.100]  I'm sure you've read the Gonzalez memos and the Yu memos.
[01:46:46.581 --> 01:46:55.206]  How do you get to a point as a White House counsel, assistant counsel like John Yu, writing memos saying we can torture little children?
[01:46:55.246 --> 01:47:01.050]  I mean, how the hell have we... I'm sorry to use that term, but how have we sunk this low?
[01:47:01.110 --> 01:47:03.111]  I feel like I'm in a Twilight Zone dream.
[01:47:04.172 --> 01:47:07.474]  Well, I think one important thing to remember is that Germany...
[01:47:08.613 --> 01:47:21.437]  A great culture, you know, and a wonderful humanist culture, a great legal system, and a tremendous lengthy tradition of scholarship, and yet Hitler managed to pervert that totally.
[01:47:22.357 --> 01:47:25.258]  There's no society that's safe from this kind of perversion.
[01:47:25.798 --> 01:47:37.761]  My moment of epiphany came, if you like, when I was having this meeting in the Foreign Office where I was protesting, saying this is illegal, we can't be accepting this stuff and this terrible torture.
[01:47:38.602 --> 01:47:50.187]  And the foreign officer's head lawyer, a guy called Sir Michael Wood, was setting out his legal arguments as to why it wasn't illegal to get intelligence and torture.
[01:47:50.887 --> 01:47:51.687]  And I knew the guy.
[01:47:51.787 --> 01:47:52.588]  He was a nice guy.
[01:47:52.628 --> 01:47:53.448]  I'd known him for years.
[01:47:53.568 --> 01:47:54.929]  Really nice, ordinary guy.
[01:47:55.369 --> 01:47:59.250]  And there's he, setting out a legal justification for getting stuff and torture.
[01:47:59.370 --> 01:48:07.894]  And at that moment, I thought I'd realized how an ordinary civil servant in Germany, someone who was nice to his kids and his neighbors thought was a nice guy,
[01:48:08.796 --> 01:48:15.719]  Could it be, you know, sitting writing out an acquisition for cattle trucks to go to Auschwitz or whatever?
[01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:24.244]  What you do is you create enough fear that the people inside the machine really believe they are fighting a terrible enemy.
[01:48:25.364 --> 01:48:26.985]  And then they'll go along with all kinds of stuff.
[01:48:27.005 --> 01:48:34.929]  How on earth we manage to get ourselves brought so quickly to that situation, I don't know.
[01:48:35.089 --> 01:48:35.409]  But the
[01:48:36.013 --> 01:48:41.191]  I've seen it on the inside, and it's a bloody ugly sight, if you'll forgive my language.
[01:48:42.242 --> 01:48:43.183]  I mean, I follow the police state.
[01:49:10.530 --> 01:49:19.240]  The point I'm making is, in England and the U.S., they're building this incredible grid of surveillance and control, and then now slowly turning the heat up.
[01:49:19.921 --> 01:49:20.141]  Yeah.
[01:49:20.682 --> 01:49:23.565]  No, I think that's true.
[01:49:23.585 --> 01:49:24.046]  You're right.
[01:49:24.106 --> 01:49:31.234]  I was really shocked today to learn from one posting on an Internet site and from someone else who contacted me directly.
[01:49:31.863 --> 01:49:33.304]  Well, it's on a... Stay there.
[01:49:33.345 --> 01:49:34.406]  Well, it's on a list, folks.
[01:49:34.426 --> 01:49:35.046]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:56.349 --> 01:49:59.490]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:49:59.850 --> 01:50:01.810]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:02.170 --> 01:50:09.832]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.492 --> 01:50:17.533]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:17.954 --> 01:50:20.874]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:50:21.214 --> 01:50:23.595]  The White House broken to disseminate fake news.
[01:50:24.015 --> 01:50:24.415]  NSA spies.
[01:50:25.327 --> 01:50:25.987]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[01:50:53.408 --> 01:50:57.011]  As snow falls on the majestic Rocky Mountains, it eventually melts.
[01:50:57.192 --> 01:51:03.117]  The water east of the continental divide travels downhill over 1600 miles before reaching the Atlantic Ocean.
[01:51:03.277 --> 01:51:07.961]  On the western side, water travels downhill almost a thousand miles to reach the Pacific Ocean.
[01:51:07.981 --> 01:51:10.784]  As you ponder this miracle, ask yourself this question.
[01:51:11.064 --> 01:51:15.149]  How many people and animals has that water passed through before it reaches my area?
[01:51:15.590 --> 01:51:19.635]  Berkey has revolutionized the way water is purified simply, internationally.
[01:51:19.775 --> 01:51:23.420]  At the heart of these portable systems are the black Berkey purification elements.
[01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:28.967]  So powerful, these elements extract pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, heavy metals, and...
[01:51:29.207 --> 01:51:31.789]  Yeah, they can purify that downward flowing water.
[01:51:31.869 --> 01:51:38.856]  Berkey Purification Systems getting rid of the unhealthy stuff in your water while leaving you healthy beneficial materials that your body needs.

[01:52:09.611 --> 01:52:10.212]  I think so.
[01:52:25.103 --> 01:52:25.463]  We're good to go.
[01:52:57.711 --> 01:52:59.592]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:53:00.072 --> 01:53:02.893]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:04.914 --> 01:53:06.655]  This is how tyranny starts.
[01:53:08.255 --> 01:53:13.517]  Oh, we've got to take your shampoo, your lipstick because of the terrorists, because they want to mix them.
[01:53:13.937 --> 01:53:16.038]  Then they mix them in a big bucket right in front of you.
[01:53:16.478 --> 01:53:17.819]  It's about making you comply.
[01:53:17.839 --> 01:53:19.740]  It's about training you to do stupid things.
[01:53:20.140 --> 01:53:22.781]  And then now, oh, there's certain books that are on a list.
[01:53:23.374 --> 01:53:30.737]  People are getting arrested all the time for having books that have the name terror in them, even though a lot of times it's pro-war, neocon propaganda.
[01:53:32.258 --> 01:53:38.281]  Arab men can hardly even fly, or even Indians for that matter, who aren't even Muslims.
[01:53:38.661 --> 01:53:41.042]  People just demand they be taken off the plane.
[01:53:41.602 --> 01:53:51.347]  Again, giving in to this fear that the government and the corporate interests are going to use that until we're at the point living on state-owned cotton plantations and
[01:53:52.590 --> 01:53:53.791]  I mean, it's scary, folks.
[01:53:53.911 --> 01:53:56.492]  I just can't believe we're turning into this.
[01:53:57.053 --> 01:54:03.696]  Former British Ambassador to Uzbekistan, one of the most corrupt countries in the world with incredible levels of torture, public boiling.
[01:54:05.037 --> 01:54:14.062]  Craig Murray, in closing, tell us about your new book that exposes all this torture and stuff, and then please continue with where you left off.
[01:54:14.922 --> 01:54:15.282]  Yeah, thanks.
[01:54:15.883 --> 01:54:17.964]  Yeah, no, my book, which...
[01:54:19.276 --> 01:54:25.497]  It's not published in the States yet, but you can get it from amazon.co.uk.
[01:54:25.617 --> 01:54:28.138]  That's amazon.co.uk.
[01:54:28.698 --> 01:54:30.538]  It's called Murder in Samarkand.
[01:54:31.099 --> 01:54:35.159]  You just do a search on my name, Craig Murray, on Amazon, you'll be able to find it.
[01:54:35.279 --> 01:54:40.961]  Or you can get it through my website, which is craigmurray.co.uk.
[01:54:41.541 --> 01:54:46.342]  But it sets out all these...
[01:54:47.552 --> 01:54:50.834]  Evidence that the CIA uses intelligence obtained through torture.
[01:54:51.434 --> 01:54:56.636]  It sets out the story of the weapons of mass destruction charade.
[01:54:57.457 --> 01:55:02.379]  But perhaps most importantly, it's a very personal story.
[01:55:02.419 --> 01:55:15.045]  It's the kind of psychological story of how Bush and Blair managed to pervert their civil service, their public servants, the people in their diplomats and their...
[01:55:16.521 --> 01:55:17.381]  It's quite astonishing.
[01:55:17.461 --> 01:55:25.924]  And isn't it scary that our culture is so shallow that those airport screening people aren't turning around and saying to their bosses, I'm not going to
[01:55:40.939 --> 01:55:41.539]  Take books?
[01:55:41.659 --> 01:55:43.701]  Why am I censoring books?
[01:55:44.821 --> 01:55:50.305]  It really is quite a... It just shows how easy it is.
[01:55:50.345 --> 01:56:00.691]  The trouble is... I thought initially, if I brought this torture to the attention of my own bosses and of Tony Blair and Jack Straw...
[01:56:01.639 --> 01:56:03.060]  Then they would stop it happening.
[01:56:03.080 --> 01:56:04.501]  I thought it must be they don't know.
[01:56:04.721 --> 01:56:05.522]  Maybe I was naive.
[01:56:05.542 --> 01:56:08.464]  Yeah, you found out how real this was because they said, of course we're doing it.
[01:56:08.524 --> 01:56:08.944]  Shut up!
[01:56:09.424 --> 01:56:10.545]  Yeah, and then they sacked me.
[01:56:11.126 --> 01:56:26.836]  Not only did they sack me, and this is the subject of the book as well, they decided they had to discredit me, so they built allegations of me, against me, of issuing visas in exchange for sex, of stealing money, of being an alcoholic, all kinds of stuff.
[01:56:27.377 --> 01:56:30.539]  In the end, I was acquitted of all charges after two years.
[01:56:33.845 --> 01:56:44.688]  Well, it's people like you that may save the UK and may save the US.
[01:56:45.008 --> 01:56:48.349]  If we go down into total tyranny, it will be an engine of evil.
[01:56:48.409 --> 01:56:54.091]  We will be used as a dark sword forged in hell to conquer the planet for these sicko corporations.
[01:56:54.651 --> 01:56:55.172]  Thank you very much.
[01:56:55.212 --> 01:56:55.752]  Thank you.
[01:56:55.992 --> 01:56:56.813]  I've enjoyed it.
[01:56:56.833 --> 01:56:57.433]  Thank you.
[01:56:57.934 --> 01:57:01.056]  If it wasn't for people like him, we'd be in much worse shape.
[01:57:01.096 --> 01:57:02.577]  No matter how bad things are right now.
[01:57:02.597 --> 01:57:04.018]  Believe me, it'd be a lot worse.
[01:57:23.684 --> 01:57:25.766]  We're headed into bad, bad times, folks.
[01:57:25.846 --> 01:57:29.249]  The White House writes memos saying they can rape children.
[01:57:33.012 --> 01:57:36.915]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.

[01:57:38.116 --> 01:57:38.456]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.427 --> 01:57:51.527]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.208 --> 01:57:53.328]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:53.968 --> 01:57:54.788]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.529 --> 01:57:56.449]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.089 --> 01:58:00.770]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.271 --> 01:58:05.412]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:13.254 --> 01:58:18.216]  You know, during this segment, I'm just going to introduce it and we're going to play it and we're going to come back with an in-studio guest.
[01:58:19.568 --> 01:58:21.609]  Talking about the animal ID of the American Union.
[01:58:22.729 --> 01:58:25.710]  But there was this story today out of the Associated Press.
[01:58:26.611 --> 01:58:28.672]  Military recruiters cited for misconduct.
[01:58:29.012 --> 01:58:34.874]  More than 100 young women were raped, were beaten, you name it, by the U.S.
[01:58:34.954 --> 01:58:36.014]  Army and U.S.
[01:58:36.034 --> 01:58:36.915]  Marine Corps recruiters.
[01:58:37.595 --> 01:58:40.016]  This didn't used to happen in the past at this level.
[01:58:40.808 --> 01:58:48.510]  Well, that's because now the majority of new recruits are either gang members or felons, aggravated felons.
[01:58:48.530 --> 01:58:49.531]  That's mainstream news.
[01:58:49.951 --> 01:58:52.592]  I'm going to go over that more later, but I'm frankly almost out of time here.
[01:58:53.012 --> 01:58:55.853]  Here's even a Geraldo Herrera piece from a few weeks ago.
[01:58:55.873 --> 01:58:57.693]  It's like a 15-minute piece.
[01:58:57.733 --> 01:59:03.735]  Here's the first three minutes talking about how there's so many gang members in the military.
[01:59:04.255 --> 01:59:05.096]  What do you expect?
[01:59:05.236 --> 01:59:05.796]  Go ahead and roll it.
[01:59:07.992 --> 01:59:13.114]  They have infiltrated every branch of the armed forces, the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines.
[01:59:13.554 --> 01:59:19.857]  Yet these troops aren't just fighting for liberty and freedom, but also for the colors and codes of dangerous street gangs.
[01:59:21.877 --> 01:59:25.279]  They're in there for one purpose, and that is for their gang.
[01:59:26.159 --> 01:59:31.641]  Terry says he's locked up many gangster soldiers during his 14-year-long career as a military police detective.
[01:59:32.261 --> 01:59:36.823]  Today, he's a government special agent whose assignment prevents us from revealing his identity.
[01:59:37.623 --> 01:59:42.691]  Guys come in, they are loyal to their set or clique.
[01:59:42.991 --> 01:59:50.443]  Yes, they have some allegiance to the Army, but if it comes down to it, they're a gang member.
[01:59:51.141 --> 01:59:55.524]  And it seems no installation is gang-free at Fort Lewis in Washington State.
[01:59:55.945 --> 01:59:59.547]  One investigator says he has identified 320 soldiers.
[02:00:00.028 --> 02:00:08.514]  Loyal also to criminal organizations like the National Alliance, Crips, Gangster Disciples, Florencia 13, and others.
[02:00:09.034 --> 02:00:11.356]  Many still showing the ink of their sex tattoos.
[02:00:13.115 --> 02:00:23.199]  And at this concert inside an NCO club on base at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, hundreds of soldiers are seen throwing gang signs, unafraid of who's watching.
[02:00:23.919 --> 02:00:33.802]  Even thousands of miles away from home, these gang-affiliated GIs are marking their territory in the sands of Iraq, where they scrawl graffiti on tanks, latrines, and barracks.
[02:00:34.983 --> 02:00:38.904]  Gang members are a clear and present danger to the military way of life.
[02:00:39.665 --> 02:00:48.371]  According to experts, the largest group to have gained a foothold in the military is Folk Nation, an offshoot of the notoriously deadly Gangster Disciples out of Chicago.
[02:00:49.612 --> 02:00:55.696]  There are members that have been in the military and have gotten time for doing violent crimes.
[02:00:56.216 --> 02:00:59.358]  Here in Texas, gangs in uniform have the FBI worried.
[02:00:59.798 --> 02:01:06.663]  Over the course of the next several years, between 10,000 and 20,000 troops will be relocated to Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas.
[02:01:07.143 --> 02:01:14.350]  And in the wave of overwhelmingly law-abiding good soldiers, will be hidden a handful, the authorities fear, from the Folk Nation gang.
[02:01:14.410 --> 02:01:15.071]  That's not true.
[02:01:15.091 --> 02:01:20.135]  And they'll be moving right into the backyard of Barrio Azteca, an established El Paso civilian gang.
[02:01:20.476 --> 02:01:24.379]  And what the authorities fear is that that could create a violent turf war.
[02:01:24.780 --> 02:01:31.406]  We've identified an excess of 800 members that claim allegiance to a gang under Folk Nation.
[02:01:32.546 --> 02:01:48.475]  Some in the FBI, like Special Agent Jeremy Francis, believe gang leaders are actually trying to place new recruits with clean records into the ranks of the military, hoping to gain access to weapons and combat training, so they can then take that potentially deadly knowledge back to the streets.
[02:01:49.444 --> 02:01:53.166]  Geraldo, oh, there's very few gang members in the military.
[02:01:53.246 --> 02:01:58.209]  I have the mainstream news articles where entire units are made up of gang members.
[02:01:58.749 --> 02:02:00.190]  I've talked to the troops coming back.
[02:02:00.350 --> 02:02:01.391]  It is hellish.
[02:02:01.431 --> 02:02:08.074]  We have video of the troops shooting cars up for fun, running over them with tanks because they caught somebody stealing a stick of wood.
[02:02:08.334 --> 02:02:10.615]  They're all flashing gang signs while they do it.
[02:02:10.976 --> 02:02:13.537]  They do this in front of news cameras, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:14.297 --> 02:02:15.158]  This isn't hidden.
[02:02:16.565 --> 02:02:22.648]  And with the military so busy stealing, and there's so much thieving going on in the military now, of course the gang members fit right in.
[02:02:22.668 --> 02:02:25.249]  The government wants them in.
[02:02:25.849 --> 02:02:29.891]  Because they'll follow orders oppressing the American people.
[02:02:30.231 --> 02:02:31.512]  So there's your esprit de corps.
[02:02:31.532 --> 02:02:32.072]  There you go.
[02:02:32.092 --> 02:02:35.154]  A bunch of gang-banging scum.
[02:02:36.174 --> 02:02:36.974]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:36.994 --> 02:02:37.535]  Stay with us.
[02:02:46.488 --> 02:02:49.670]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:50.011 --> 02:02:51.952]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:52.332 --> 02:02:59.978]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:00.659 --> 02:03:07.704]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:08.104 --> 02:03:11.026]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:03:11.446 --> 02:03:13.788]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[02:03:14.188 --> 02:03:15.009]  NSA spies.
[02:03:16.418 --> 02:03:19.539]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[02:03:19.839 --> 02:03:23.360]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:23.820 --> 02:03:25.721]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:26.061 --> 02:03:29.962]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:43.621 --> 02:03:45.462]  Dad, can we stop?
[02:03:45.802 --> 02:03:47.362]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[02:03:47.743 --> 02:03:48.003]  What?
[02:03:48.563 --> 02:03:48.983]  Again?
[02:03:49.663 --> 02:03:51.284]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[02:03:51.544 --> 02:03:52.785]  Honey, we better stop.
[02:03:52.985 --> 02:03:55.285]  I gave the kids their Sport Berkey water bottles.
[02:03:55.606 --> 02:03:56.886]  Why did you do that?
[02:03:57.166 --> 02:03:59.627]  Because they can't sit and talk at the same time.
[02:03:59.847 --> 02:04:02.708]  Or would you rather listen to them singing Are we there yet?
[02:04:02.968 --> 02:04:04.009]  Are we there yet?
[02:04:04.069 --> 02:04:05.369]  for the entire trip.
[02:04:05.389 --> 02:04:07.810]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[02:04:08.310 --> 02:04:09.251]  Great idea.
[02:04:09.271 --> 02:04:12.192]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[02:04:12.546 --> 02:04:15.047]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[02:04:15.247 --> 02:04:19.528]  And using our Berkey Sport bottles, it costs less than 2.5 cents per refill.
[02:04:19.708 --> 02:04:21.849]  And we can purify water from the lake as well.
[02:04:22.069 --> 02:04:24.009]  Honey, you're terrific!
[02:04:24.549 --> 02:04:25.270]  I know, dear.
[02:04:25.570 --> 02:04:27.090]  Now find us a restroom.
[02:04:27.570 --> 02:04:28.450]  I need to stop, too.
[02:04:28.630 --> 02:04:33.092]  Get your Berkey Sport purification bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:33.152 --> 02:04:33.452]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:33.492 --> 02:04:35.052]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:04:43.419 --> 02:04:45.900]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[02:04:46.021 --> 02:04:48.382]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[02:04:48.442 --> 02:04:54.626]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[02:04:56.106 --> 02:04:58.408]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:04:59.068 --> 02:05:02.610]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:05:03.150 --> 02:05:07.293]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:05:07.873 --> 02:05:10.815]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:05:11.801 --> 02:05:14.722]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:05:15.462 --> 02:05:21.204]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:05:21.264 --> 02:05:25.646]  That's 1-888-892-6238.
[02:05:26.026 --> 02:05:29.367]  For the following two free reports, U.S.
[02:05:29.447 --> 02:05:32.368]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[02:05:33.328 --> 02:05:35.629]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[02:05:35.689 --> 02:05:39.870]  That's 888-8XANADU.
[02:05:40.211 --> 02:05:41.171]  And ask for George.
[02:05:47.778 --> 02:05:48.439]  Big Brother.
[02:05:49.099 --> 02:05:50.139]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:50.859 --> 02:05:51.980]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:52.620 --> 02:05:53.440]  You want answers?
[02:05:54.180 --> 02:05:55.020]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:55.081 --> 02:05:59.642]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:59.942 --> 02:06:04.063]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:06.964 --> 02:06:14.626]  In Russia, in the United Kingdom, in Japan, in Australia, in Spain, in Canada, in Mexico...
[02:06:15.541 --> 02:06:33.523]  And right here in the United States, huge projects are taking place where private interests come in and lobby your governments to sign over existing roads and to sign over taxing authority on those roads to then build even larger toll roads.
[02:06:34.855 --> 02:06:37.758]  From down in southern Mexico, this is all official, U.S.
[02:06:37.778 --> 02:06:41.601]  government documents, to right up into Canada, right through Minneapolis, St.
[02:06:41.641 --> 02:06:44.804]  Paul, we're going to have these huge NAFTA highways.
[02:06:44.864 --> 02:06:51.510]  And part of those, in each state they have the Florida corridors, state corridors.
[02:06:51.570 --> 02:06:54.473]  In Texas, they have the Trans-Texas corridors.
[02:06:54.493 --> 02:06:58.897]  They always give it a local name, but it's international in scope.
[02:06:59.117 --> 02:07:01.259]  And it's a nightmare.
[02:07:02.037 --> 02:07:16.893]  On top of that, we have the federal law they're trying to ram through, and Texas already passed an accompanying legislation to start the Animal ID Act, where you'll have inspectors on your property, you've got to report stuff within days, or you get multi-thousand dollar fines.
[02:07:17.774 --> 02:07:23.440]  It's total federal control, violation of the Tenth Amendment, and it creates a whole new bureaucracy, and guess who wrote the legislation?
[02:07:23.880 --> 02:07:32.363]  Big agribusiness, Cargill and others, and Archer Daniels Midland and Tyson, because they want to run their competition out of business.
[02:07:32.383 --> 02:07:36.664]  They want big, huge ranches, big, huge contract farms that supply them.
[02:07:36.965 --> 02:07:38.665]  They want to knock out the small herds.
[02:07:38.685 --> 02:07:40.566]  They want to knock out the small farms.
[02:07:40.806 --> 02:07:42.066]  And they're doing it right now.
[02:07:42.146 --> 02:07:42.987]  This is the plan.
[02:07:43.327 --> 02:07:49.889]  And I'm excited to learn that Hank Gilbert is running as a Democrat, and he's a multi-generation Democrat.
[02:07:50.621 --> 02:07:52.863]  Rancher from Northeast Texas.
[02:07:53.423 --> 02:07:59.307]  He also has written legislation that they've now gotten introduced to try to overturn some of this stuff that's happening.
[02:07:59.807 --> 02:08:02.569]  And he also, of course, has been a high school ag teacher.
[02:08:03.029 --> 02:08:06.171]  And it's great to have you with us, Mr. Gilbert.
[02:08:06.611 --> 02:08:07.452]  Appreciate you joining us.
[02:08:07.932 --> 02:08:08.873]  I'm glad to be here today.
[02:08:08.913 --> 02:08:09.573]  Thank you for asking me.
[02:08:09.853 --> 02:08:10.233]  You bet.
[02:08:10.394 --> 02:08:17.819]  Kevin Smith, of course, owns a little family ranch, had himself a couple hundred acres and has some cows, and he went to one of these trans-Texas corridor meetings.
[02:08:17.839 --> 02:08:20.581]  He said, man, you've got to get this guy Hank Gilbert in the studio with us.
[02:08:20.601 --> 02:08:23.223]  We appreciate you traveling down to be with us today, sir.
[02:08:24.084 --> 02:08:31.689]  In a nutshell, and again, this affects everybody, whether you're in Minnesota or California, Ohio, or anywhere in the world, the same scams are happening right now.
[02:08:32.210 --> 02:08:38.915]  Tell us a little bit about yourself, and then let's get into why we need to elect you so that you can stand up against this.
[02:08:39.535 --> 02:08:45.597]  Well, first of all, I'm a third-generation Texas rancher, and my boys, of course, will be the fourth.
[02:08:46.998 --> 02:08:52.200]  I've spent my entire life in the agriculture industry, primarily the cattle industry.
[02:08:53.580 --> 02:08:54.821]  I've owned cattle.
[02:08:55.021 --> 02:08:58.762]  I owned a cattle auction barn for a number of years, taught high school agriculture.
[02:08:59.862 --> 02:09:06.845]  It's something that's very near and dear to me, and the reason I'm in this race is to try to take
[02:09:08.146 --> 02:09:10.847]  Politics out of agriculture, at least here in Texas.
[02:09:11.528 --> 02:09:18.351]  But one of the two components that inspired me to enter this race, number one was the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[02:09:19.192 --> 02:09:21.413]  And the other was the National Animal ID System.
[02:09:21.933 --> 02:09:34.239]  And the fact that my opponent, a career politician, who's wanting this office for training to move up the ladder, supported and helped instigate these pieces of legislation in Texas.
[02:09:34.980 --> 02:09:36.961]  And as you said, the Trans-Texas Corridor
[02:09:38.055 --> 02:10:06.752]  It's probably going to have as more drastic impact on agriculture, but not just in Texas, because it is part of a national program or an international program that's going to basically take small family farms and small producers, not only from Texas, but all up through the Midwest, western part of this country, out of business to facilitate the Tysons and the Cargills and the Swifts and the Archer Daniels Midlands.
[02:10:07.526 --> 02:10:12.371]  And turn this country into one big corporately managed entity.
[02:10:14.293 --> 02:10:17.377]  Well, I can't say it any better than that, and that's what's in the documents.
[02:10:17.657 --> 02:10:24.624]  Let's get into the Animal ID, because our listeners know about the American Union system with all these highways being grabbed.
[02:10:24.644 --> 02:10:27.707]  And, of course, Texas will have 8,000 miles of these.
[02:10:27.747 --> 02:10:28.909]  The whole country only has 7,000.
[02:10:30.450 --> 02:10:32.632]  Well, I honestly believe, and I tell every group that I talk to about this,
[02:10:54.944 --> 02:11:05.570]  That this wasn't really intended for the horse and the goat and the sheep people and the small farms that have hens running around for egg production.
[02:11:06.390 --> 02:11:08.532]  I really believe this is a beef cattle issue.
[02:11:09.412 --> 02:11:13.594]  And I think they just got caught up in the net so it wouldn't look like a beef cattle issue.
[02:11:14.815 --> 02:11:17.997]  Because the three main sponsors of the federal legislation are
[02:11:18.772 --> 02:11:22.814]  are the three big meat packers of this country, Cargill, Tyson, and Swift.
[02:11:23.294 --> 02:11:33.537]  And the last time those guys got together behind any major type of piece of agricultural legislation, the small and medium-range packers were forced out of business.
[02:11:34.278 --> 02:11:45.762]  And I believe that that's the intent with this, because they are currently developing bred herds of cattle of their own in strategic places across the United States.
[02:11:46.488 --> 02:11:48.690]  For source verification purposes.
[02:11:49.430 --> 02:12:03.981]  And I believe that if they can run the small-time producers, which, by the way, in Texas, being the largest beef production state, 70% of all the beef that we produce in this state comes from people that have less than 50 head of cattle.
[02:12:04.662 --> 02:12:07.784]  So that's the bulk of our beef cattle operation here.
[02:12:08.619 --> 02:12:11.422]  And that's how people are able to pay their property taxes.
[02:12:11.462 --> 02:12:12.062]  Well, exactly.
[02:12:12.082 --> 02:12:15.805]  I mean, I've got a lot of family who've got 400, 500 acres, 200 acres.
[02:12:16.106 --> 02:12:18.428]  They've got 40, 50, 60 head of cattle.
[02:12:18.748 --> 02:12:20.349]  And that doesn't make them any money.
[02:12:20.450 --> 02:12:24.913]  It just, every 10 years, lets them get a new tractor or truck and allows them to pay the property tax.
[02:12:25.194 --> 02:12:29.317]  If you take any of the profit out of there, and they're already hanging on by their fingernails, it's gone.
[02:12:29.357 --> 02:12:32.160]  You're going to see even more farms and tiny ranchettes gone.
[02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:34.322]  Well, you look at Australia...
[02:12:35.134 --> 02:12:41.237]  And British Columbia, or not British Columbia, Great Britain, who've instigated animal ID systems.
[02:12:41.818 --> 02:12:43.759]  They've been in existence for over 10 years.
[02:12:44.319 --> 02:12:45.239]  They still don't work.
[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:53.284]  But they're costing those producers anywhere from $40 to $70 a head to participate in that system.
[02:12:53.924 --> 02:13:00.908]  Now, you take that on the scale of a guy that's got 50 cows, and he has to implement that on his cows and his calves.
[02:13:01.988 --> 02:13:02.869]  He goes in the hole.
[02:13:03.562 --> 02:13:09.545]  Because they're operating even in a good year of a profit or $50 to $60 a head.
[02:13:09.585 --> 02:13:19.991]  Well, also, the big three packers that are 90 plus percent of the market, they've been caught manipulating and basically they set the price of cattle many times lower than it is to even produce them.
[02:13:20.211 --> 02:13:23.313]  Right, and that's my opinion of where this is headed.
[02:13:23.333 --> 02:13:28.055]  You know, they control the entire processed beef cattle market.
[02:13:29.156 --> 02:13:31.157]  If they can get this system up and running...
[02:13:31.835 --> 02:13:43.128]  and force a lot of these small producers out of business they're going to eventually have total control of the live cattle market which allows them to influence the price of live cattle at any given time
[02:13:44.975 --> 02:13:46.555]  And make more money on the other end.
[02:13:46.675 --> 02:13:51.356]  Have you heard this new thing that the big three packers got passed and then the FDA signed off?
[02:13:51.376 --> 02:13:56.398]  They're going to spray live virus on the meat now instead of making sure that they keep it cold and keep it fresh.
[02:13:56.798 --> 02:14:02.079]  Now, not just irradiating it to ruin the quality, but now they're going to spray live virus on it that eats the bacteria.
[02:14:02.439 --> 02:14:04.299]  I mean, this is getting crazier and crazier.
[02:14:04.599 --> 02:14:11.501]  Well, I'm telling you, Alex, what a lot of people don't understand about the meat industry is
[02:14:13.560 --> 02:14:26.069]  The big three meatpackers have fought through lobbying and through buying off legislators to preventing any type of cool legislation from being introduced.
[02:14:26.169 --> 02:14:27.290]  Country of origin labeling.
[02:14:28.251 --> 02:14:29.572]  They don't want people to know
[02:14:30.510 --> 02:14:32.130]  Where their meat's coming from.
[02:14:32.271 --> 02:14:33.631]  Well, see, that's another thing I was going to add.
[02:14:33.651 --> 02:14:35.331]  They're not going to let you know it's irradiated.
[02:14:35.551 --> 02:14:38.452]  They're not going to let you know they're spraying live virus on it that eats the bacteria.
[02:14:38.612 --> 02:14:43.834]  And that's what it translates to out of Greek is bacteria eaters is what these viruses are called.
[02:14:43.854 --> 02:14:45.474]  And there's a lot of evidence it's really bad for you.
[02:14:46.014 --> 02:14:49.475]  You've got that going on, and they won't let you know that that's being sprayed on there.
[02:14:49.715 --> 02:14:57.897]  And exactly, they claim this is to stop terrorism, but then it's admitted that the big packers wrote up the legislation, and it actually keeps you from knowing where it came from.
[02:14:57.917 --> 02:14:59.598]  It has nothing to do with terrorism.
[02:15:00.138 --> 02:15:00.358]  Right.
[02:15:00.438 --> 02:15:05.242]  I mean, we export on any given year more beef than we import.
[02:15:05.502 --> 02:15:10.785]  But what we export is the high-end cuts of the beef, the choice and the primes.
[02:15:11.546 --> 02:15:15.108]  And we import lower-grade cuts.
[02:15:15.348 --> 02:15:15.989]  Hamburger meat.
[02:15:16.169 --> 02:15:18.711]  Well, not only hamburger meat, but lower-grade steak.
[02:15:18.771 --> 02:15:23.254]  A lot of your select and your standard grades, we import.
[02:15:23.654 --> 02:15:26.516]  And that's what you see most of in the supermarkets.
[02:15:27.026 --> 02:15:31.168]  And that's why the Angus Beef Program has been such a huge success.
[02:15:31.188 --> 02:15:32.148]  Because it's really American.
[02:15:32.648 --> 02:15:33.589]  But that's a misnomer.
[02:15:33.609 --> 02:15:34.809]  Now they're sneaking it in.
[02:15:34.969 --> 02:15:35.729]  Now they're sneaking it in.
[02:15:35.829 --> 02:15:39.851]  The Angus Beef Program is a combination of American and Canadian beef.
[02:15:40.591 --> 02:15:41.212]  People don't understand.
[02:15:41.232 --> 02:15:42.952]  See, I can say they're Canadian better than Mexican.
[02:15:43.032 --> 02:15:44.533]  I mean, I still consider it North American.
[02:15:44.553 --> 02:15:46.914]  Well, sometimes it is and sometimes it's not.
[02:15:47.474 --> 02:15:52.516]  But most of what you see in the supermarket, particularly in your ground beef, comes from Brazil.
[02:15:53.183 --> 02:15:54.544]  Yeah, that's the stuff I'm worried about.
[02:15:54.604 --> 02:15:55.884]  It's got the vampire bats on it.
[02:15:55.924 --> 02:16:01.346]  Your higher-end cuts, your steaks and all, a lot of that will come from Australia or Argentina.
[02:16:01.866 --> 02:16:04.467]  But the biggest majority of it is not U.S.
[02:16:04.507 --> 02:16:04.807]  beef.
[02:16:05.608 --> 02:16:09.029]  And that's why they don't want any country of origin labeling.
[02:16:09.856 --> 02:16:12.457]  On not only beef, but on your produce also.
[02:16:12.557 --> 02:16:24.700]  My dad always made that joke because McDonald's would say 100% American, but it had been in the news that it meant anywhere in the American hemisphere, anywhere from Canada down to Chile.
[02:16:24.900 --> 02:16:25.160]  Right.
[02:16:25.380 --> 02:16:30.782]  See, we're allowing Mexico to import, through NAFTA, around 150,000 head of cattle a month into Texas.
[02:16:35.260 --> 02:16:37.001]  Well, that's some rancid cattle, too.
[02:16:37.141 --> 02:16:44.724]  But we can't export live cattle in or through Mexico because our Ag Commissioner is more of a politician than she is.
[02:16:44.824 --> 02:16:46.364]  Well, see, that shows how I was perceived.
[02:16:46.424 --> 02:16:54.247]  I knew that some of the Angus was from out of the country, but I thought it got started up to get that popular brand that was developed here in the U.S.
[02:16:54.407 --> 02:16:54.968]  more popular.
[02:16:54.988 --> 02:16:56.248]  But you're saying that's another scam, too.
[02:16:56.388 --> 02:16:59.509]  Well, it's actually Canadian and US beef.
[02:17:01.513 --> 02:17:07.358]  Because they have a lot of Angus producers in Canada that lobbied to get their beef included in that Angus beef market.
[02:17:08.619 --> 02:17:14.884]  Well, for those that don't know, this is all meant to shut down any type of free economy, any type of people being self-sufficient.
[02:17:15.105 --> 02:17:17.607]  It's all about forcing you to work for a big global corporation.
[02:17:18.454 --> 02:17:28.557]  And the same folks that are behind the open borders of the American Union and the NAFTA highways are the same people pushing for the Animal ID Act, which is so bad.
[02:17:28.577 --> 02:17:29.337]  I mean, I've read over it.
[02:17:29.657 --> 02:17:33.839]  It's so bad, it's hard to describe just how bad it really is.
[02:17:34.459 --> 02:17:41.621]  Let's come back with our guest, Hank Gilbert, who's running for the Texas Agriculture Commissioner, and we'll talk about how we can support him and a lot more.
[02:17:41.641 --> 02:17:42.001]  Stay with us.
[02:17:43.849 --> 02:17:46.731]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:17:47.071 --> 02:17:49.952]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:17:50.192 --> 02:17:56.376]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[02:18:38.575 --> 02:18:49.139]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:18:50.339 --> 02:18:55.161]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum, and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:18:55.361 --> 02:18:58.102]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:18:58.142 --> 02:18:59.263]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:19:00.603 --> 02:19:05.185]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:19:06.107 --> 02:19:13.392]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:19:14.373 --> 02:19:18.135]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[02:19:19.596 --> 02:19:23.059]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.

[02:19:35.794 --> 02:19:35.994]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:43.169 --> 02:19:45.530]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:45.630 --> 02:19:56.095]  Did you know that President Kennedy signed into law State Department Publication 7277 entitled The United States Program for Complete and General Disarmament in a Peaceful World?
[02:19:56.175 --> 02:20:01.377]  This would disarm America and turn all of our armed forces over to the United Nations organization.
[02:20:02.118 --> 02:20:06.560]  Citizens would be required to turn in their guns guaranteed to them by the Second Amendment.
[02:20:07.249 --> 02:20:12.950]  The head of the United Nations forces that would control all arms would always be a communist by agreement.

[02:21:25.114 --> 02:21:26.455]  Folks, Hank Gilbert is the only...
[02:21:54.176 --> 02:21:55.236]  Nominee for the Democrats.
[02:21:55.276 --> 02:21:57.697]  He is the nominee for Texas Commissioner of Agriculture.
[02:21:58.537 --> 02:22:05.059]  And I tell you, Republicans out there listening, if you vote for Rick Perry or any of these Republicans, you are idiots.
[02:22:06.320 --> 02:22:07.500]  I mean, here we've got a Democrat.
[02:22:07.520 --> 02:22:18.843]  He's in there talking about, during the break, controlling the borders, getting rid of this federal control with the Real ID Act, shooting down the NAFTA corridor system that they call the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[02:22:19.344 --> 02:22:20.344]  I mean, I tell you, sir...
[02:22:21.758 --> 02:22:25.399]  I'm a little bit ignorant on all the state politics because I'm so busy on the national.
[02:22:25.419 --> 02:22:26.479]  This is a national show.
[02:22:27.159 --> 02:22:29.300]  But as you said, this is a microcosm of the rest of the country.
[02:22:29.680 --> 02:22:30.860]  People need to support you.
[02:22:30.920 --> 02:22:33.020]  The Democrats have got a good chance of winning.
[02:22:34.501 --> 02:22:36.341]  What are the polls looking like right now?
[02:22:36.841 --> 02:22:42.062]  Well, nobody's taking any polls on this race, and we haven't, mainly because we don't have the money to.
[02:22:42.182 --> 02:22:44.983]  Well, it's an important position, as you know, obviously.
[02:22:45.483 --> 02:22:49.644]  Well, this is where the Republicans started their stronghold on the state of Texas through Rick Perry.
[02:22:50.276 --> 02:23:03.426]  This was, you know, he beat Jim Hightower out to basically launch his career in Texas politics, and it's gone downhill from there, particularly in the agricultural industry.
[02:23:04.407 --> 02:23:06.308]  And, you know, I'm not a politician.
[02:23:06.328 --> 02:23:10.892]  That's the first thing I tell people, because I can't stand politics or politicians.
[02:23:11.889 --> 02:23:16.811]  But I am and do have a vested interest in agriculture and always have.
[02:23:17.331 --> 02:23:20.833]  But the things that are going on in this state are going to affect this whole country.
[02:23:21.533 --> 02:23:23.994]  Whether it's an animal ID, I mean, that's a national act.
[02:23:24.034 --> 02:23:28.616]  Whether it's a trans-Texas corridor, that's part of a national and international highway system.
[02:23:29.156 --> 02:23:31.117]  Both are going to single-handedly...
[02:23:33.560 --> 02:23:42.788]  Well, Hank Gilbert is against this American Union.
[02:23:42.849 --> 02:23:45.871]  Hank Gilbert is against the Animal ID Act.
[02:23:46.232 --> 02:23:48.033]  Hank Gilbert is against the open borders.
[02:23:48.313 --> 02:23:50.575]  Rick Perry is for every one of those things.
[02:23:50.936 --> 02:23:52.657]  Why are Republicans supporting him?
[02:23:52.697 --> 02:23:53.358]  I'll tell you why.
[02:23:53.818 --> 02:24:01.000]  Because these fake neocons on talk radio are not real conservatives, and they are there keeping the constituency in the dark.
[02:24:01.621 --> 02:24:04.101]  How much success have you had getting on all these shows?
[02:24:04.121 --> 02:24:06.022]  I know you're traveling all over the state and people love you.
[02:24:06.222 --> 02:24:18.646]  I mean, when 90 plus percent of people are against these highways, when 90 percent of people are against the animal idea, it's even higher than that, 97 in a Houston poll on the roads, I mean, you should win by 70 percent.
[02:24:19.126 --> 02:24:20.747]  Well, common sense would tell you that.
[02:24:21.307 --> 02:24:26.369]  But what you have to look at in reality is that politics is driven by money.
[02:24:27.630 --> 02:24:33.012]  And my opponent either created or helped push through all this legislation.
[02:24:34.853 --> 02:24:35.913]  And he's going to have money.
[02:24:36.173 --> 02:24:40.515]  He's not going to have a tremendous amount compared to his counterparts.
[02:24:41.116 --> 02:24:46.618]  But I believe that the mindset of American politics and Texas politics
[02:24:47.242 --> 02:24:52.384]  Has been geared around the misconception that the one with the most money is the one that wins.
[02:24:52.924 --> 02:24:55.465]  And so we have two issues to prove in this election.
[02:24:56.066 --> 02:25:05.169]  Number one, that the most qualified candidate for the job that actually has a vested interest in history in agriculture is indeed the best candidate.
[02:25:05.930 --> 02:25:11.752]  And that that candidate can win this election without having to be a millionaire or know millionaires.
[02:25:12.290 --> 02:25:22.335]  And it can make politics what our forefathers envisioned it to be, a true public service done by people who are involved... Well, you're right, and what they're running for.
[02:25:22.395 --> 02:25:23.015]  Well, exactly.
[02:25:23.055 --> 02:25:25.776]  In the past, it was looked down on if somebody was an elitist.
[02:25:26.136 --> 02:25:32.279]  And it was really looked down on if somebody was trying to get into politics, you know, in an area where they could just help themselves to a greater degree.
[02:25:32.740 --> 02:25:33.280]  And, I mean...
[02:25:33.960 --> 02:25:34.840]  This is incredible.
[02:25:34.920 --> 02:25:38.381]  I mean, the people don't want these roads, these toll roads.
[02:25:38.421 --> 02:25:41.922]  They don't want this Animal ID Act and this new federal bureaucracy.
[02:25:42.202 --> 02:25:48.924]  They don't want any of this, but the Republican Party and this state are the ones literally bringing it to us.
[02:25:49.704 --> 02:25:53.545]  And I believe that they think that they have the majority of the people behind them.
[02:25:54.146 --> 02:26:02.148]  Now, I attended 21 of these 55 textile meetings across the state, the largest one being held in Temple, with over 1,800 people in attendance.
[02:26:04.153 --> 02:26:14.960]  When told of how many people in the audience were for the Trans-Texas Corridor, right at the beginning of the meeting, 11 people raised their hands out of 1,800.
[02:26:15.260 --> 02:26:19.323]  And I guarantee you, because I've been to these, those were either TxDOT workers or bureaucrats.
[02:26:19.363 --> 02:26:21.144]  They were city and county officials.
[02:26:21.564 --> 02:26:22.024]  There you go.
[02:26:22.044 --> 02:26:22.504]  For Temple.
[02:26:22.525 --> 02:26:23.725]  Again, 1,800 people and...
[02:26:27.205 --> 02:26:28.866]  I mean, what percentage of 1,800 is 11?
[02:26:29.526 --> 02:26:30.347]  Very, very small.
[02:26:30.467 --> 02:26:30.927]  It's not even 1%?
[02:26:31.828 --> 02:26:32.288]  Very small.
[02:26:32.308 --> 02:26:37.571]  Hopefully the same percentage Rick Perry and Todd Staples and some of these other people will pull on November the 7th.
[02:26:37.871 --> 02:26:50.119]  Well, you see, they've got those special voting machines in where Michael McCall's 15 points behind but magically wins in Travis County because his father-in-law happens to own Hardinner Civics where the ballots are all cast for him.
[02:26:50.579 --> 02:26:54.962]  Well, it's like Senator Hagel owning his own voting machine company in Nebraska.
[02:26:55.822 --> 02:26:56.483]  I would hope that...
[02:26:57.625 --> 02:27:11.520]  Between now and November, that maybe something comes out on how these voting machines can be manipulated and somebody... Well, the good news is... Somebody smarter than me files a lawsuit to prevent those from being used and we go to a paper ballot.
[02:27:12.040 --> 02:27:16.545]  I mean, I believe in actually being able to see what you've done.
[02:27:17.506 --> 02:27:20.209]  And it took me a long time to get used to computers.
[02:27:20.828 --> 02:27:28.492]  Because I like the paper and pad and pencil thing very... But when it comes to voting, when it comes to something... We've got a break.
[02:27:28.512 --> 02:27:29.193]  We've got a break.
[02:27:29.573 --> 02:27:30.353]  Finish that after the break.
[02:27:30.373 --> 02:27:31.054]  This is riveting.
[02:27:33.355 --> 02:27:34.256]  We're on the march.
[02:27:34.756 --> 02:27:36.357]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:37.277 --> 02:27:39.959]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:44.065 --> 02:27:46.407]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:27:46.647 --> 02:27:48.689]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:27:48.829 --> 02:27:55.874]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[02:27:56.154 --> 02:28:04.721]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[02:28:05.061 --> 02:28:09.745]  Now for the first time, Calbin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[02:28:09.885 --> 02:28:16.571]  That's great news because Calbin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients, is earth-friendly, and completely environmentally safe.
[02:28:16.731 --> 02:28:21.074]  So if you want yesterday's values today for good old-fashioned pure soap, call 1-800-340-7091.

[02:28:31.662 --> 02:28:34.224]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[02:28:43.732 --> 02:28:44.373]  We're good to go.
[02:29:05.436 --> 02:29:11.940]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:29:12.120 --> 02:29:17.203]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:29:17.323 --> 02:29:26.209]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:29:26.469 --> 02:29:29.751]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5
[02:29:31.852 --> 02:29:35.875]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:29:38.517 --> 02:29:41.279]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:29:43.260 --> 02:29:47.323]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want the milk.
[02:29:47.523 --> 02:29:50.925]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:29:51.106 --> 02:29:54.508]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:29:54.835 --> 02:29:58.037]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:29:58.057 --> 02:30:03.580]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 7-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:30:03.600 --> 02:30:13.226]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:30:13.366 --> 02:30:14.707]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[02:30:14.747 --> 02:30:20.150]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:30:20.630 --> 02:30:25.091]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:30:25.172 --> 02:30:26.532]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:30:26.692 --> 02:30:32.594]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com That toll-free number again?
[02:30:32.614 --> 02:30:32.674]  1-877-928-8822
[02:30:51.755 --> 02:30:54.557]  Well, I tell you, we're having some great discussions during the breaks.
[02:30:58.500 --> 02:31:03.183]  We've got the gentleman, Hank Gilbert, who is running for Texas Commissioner of Agriculture.
[02:31:03.564 --> 02:31:06.106]  And there are good people out there, but you never hear about him.
[02:31:06.126 --> 02:31:07.106]  He's got the Democrat win.
[02:31:07.126 --> 02:31:11.950]  I mean, he won the primaries.
[02:31:11.990 --> 02:31:14.712]  He's the candidate running against the Republican demon.
[02:31:15.439 --> 02:31:15.679]  Yeah.
[02:31:41.914 --> 02:31:47.539]  People in agriculture and in farming, and particularly in Texas, don't have a whole lot.
[02:31:47.559 --> 02:31:50.321]  I mean, they're not the richest people in the world, but they do have one thing.
[02:31:50.361 --> 02:31:51.122]  They have their land.
[02:31:52.003 --> 02:31:54.285]  And they have a heritage built into that land.
[02:31:55.286 --> 02:31:58.388]  And they're not going to let anybody take it from them.
[02:31:59.529 --> 02:32:03.753]  And nobody has come out specifically and said anything about values or
[02:32:05.315 --> 02:32:12.638]  It's kind of been inferred that the value of that land may be the actual ag value on the tax roll rather than the commercial value.
[02:32:13.358 --> 02:32:16.599]  And a lot of these fans, I've seen people walk up to the microphone in tears.
[02:32:17.459 --> 02:32:25.381]  I've seen them walk up there just mad that this land has been in their family for five or six or seven generations, over 100 years.
[02:32:26.082 --> 02:32:33.904]  And I honestly believe that in certain areas of the state, that this has a potential to start an all-out war.
[02:32:34.682 --> 02:32:35.202]  Basically.
[02:32:35.402 --> 02:32:46.547]  I mean, people are that committed to their property and the heritage behind that property and to the sovereignty values of this state that they're not going to let somebody come in there and take it for any amount of money.
[02:32:46.727 --> 02:32:47.987]  Well, can you repeat what you said?
[02:32:48.848 --> 02:32:52.369]  I think you said, quote, I've gotten up there and told them your guns better be bigger than mine.
[02:32:52.409 --> 02:33:02.033]  Yeah, I said, you know, I can't speak for people in Central Texas, but I can speak for people in Northeast Texas, and a lot of them are going to have the mindset that, you know, your gun better be bigger than mine.
[02:33:03.154 --> 02:33:03.855]  Well, let's be clear.
[02:33:03.915 --> 02:33:08.438]  You were very well informed, and I'm not trying to sit here and be patronizing.
[02:33:09.098 --> 02:33:18.745]  I'm serious when I say that because most people I've talked to don't know that what they're doing with this new eminent domain is if private interests want your land, they can go lobby any government they want.
[02:33:19.225 --> 02:33:20.206]  That is fascism.
[02:33:20.606 --> 02:33:23.108]  That is dictatorship, as we were saying during the break.
[02:33:23.468 --> 02:33:26.070]  They can go right there and then have your land taken.
[02:33:26.390 --> 02:33:32.234]  In the case of Western Seafood in Freeport, Texas, or in the case in Piscataway, New Jersey,
[02:33:32.754 --> 02:33:33.715]  We're good to go.
[02:33:50.171 --> 02:33:55.154]  In many of these cases, the way they're writing this up, they're saying, we're going to give you a pittance on it.
[02:33:55.435 --> 02:33:58.497]  They did that here in Austin with some land they grabbed a few years ago.
[02:33:58.717 --> 02:34:11.045]  Well, you know, Alex, what's kind of ironic, my opponent is touting private property rights, yet he helped create the eminent domain portion of this bill, and it's unlike any I've ever seen concerning eminent domain.
[02:34:11.465 --> 02:34:18.230]  Eminent domain, normally if they want your land and you can't agree initially, it goes to a committee to be mediated.
[02:34:19.176 --> 02:34:23.078]  And if you don't agree with that decision, you can take it to a jury trial.
[02:34:23.759 --> 02:34:40.869]  Well, in this particular case, in this legislation, while you're waiting for your case to be heard by a judge and jury, they, by you not accepting the terms of the committee, can go to the county clerk's office, show it as a sale.
[02:34:40.889 --> 02:34:46.552]  I mean, it's basically saying, we offered this, he didn't take it, now this is what we're going to give him.
[02:34:47.350 --> 02:34:54.396]  And if you occupy that land, if it's your house that they're talking about, you will receive notice that you have 60 days to vacate that house.
[02:34:54.616 --> 02:34:56.657]  Oh, no, see, see, this is the first time you've seen it.
[02:34:56.677 --> 02:35:00.600]  But let me tell you, in New London, they came to them five years ago when the fight was heating up.
[02:35:00.620 --> 02:35:05.084]  I mean, these are three-story Victorian houses, some of them worth half a million, on the water.
[02:35:05.164 --> 02:35:08.206]  I mean, these are middle-class computer programmers, professors.
[02:35:08.667 --> 02:35:10.748]  And I keep bringing that up, folks.
[02:35:10.989 --> 02:35:12.630]  They've been doing it to poor people a long time.
[02:35:13.170 --> 02:35:32.316]  But they're going to middle class and now wealthy people now, and they came to them, and we have these families on, and they said, if you do not sign over the land for what we're offering you now that was already lowered and should be, we're going to, the city is going to claim that your house is now condemned.
[02:35:32.336 --> 02:35:36.117]  It doesn't matter if it's golden, beautiful, made out of marble.
[02:35:36.938 --> 02:35:37.379]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:36:05.814 --> 02:36:07.835]  And it ties back into what you said earlier.
[02:36:07.855 --> 02:36:17.419]  You know, TxDOT now, if the Federal Highway Administration gives them approval of this environmental study on TxDOT, then they can start purchasing the land.
[02:36:18.399 --> 02:36:25.162]  Now, they know already that several aspects of this proposed project are years away.
[02:36:26.202 --> 02:36:33.065]  But they're telling the people that, well, we'll buy it from you, and then we'll lease it back to you.
[02:36:34.011 --> 02:36:36.699]  If you don't want to lease it, then it'll be available for lease.
[02:36:38.263 --> 02:36:41.371]  In comes the big corporate farmers concerning NAIS.
[02:36:42.495 --> 02:36:50.961]  Well, that's the thing about these NAFTA highways, is they're talking about 10 miles on each side of them, and there's federal grants to fund it, and it's even going to be managed by foreign companies.
[02:36:51.281 --> 02:36:56.105]  Mexico is going to have, quote, port facilities inside the U.S., Kansas City and others.
[02:36:56.785 --> 02:36:58.887]  There'll be one outside Austin, and then the U.S.
[02:36:58.927 --> 02:37:00.268]  will have facilities in Mexico.
[02:37:00.608 --> 02:37:02.930]  I mean, I just don't think people realize how big this is.
[02:37:03.390 --> 02:37:11.936]  Well, like I said earlier, I'm not a politician, and I'm a guy who eight months ago came out of the pasture and decided to make a difference.
[02:37:12.603 --> 02:37:20.945]  And if people don't believe, you know, if there are people out there who actually are skeptical of what we're saying, I'm here to tell you, it's happening, and it's the truth.
[02:37:21.506 --> 02:37:30.708]  Well, I mean, I have friends who just a few years ago, this local fellow is a very well-known, well, actually, I can talk about him now.
[02:37:30.768 --> 02:37:33.549]  I mean, he's never asked me not to, but he's actually gone up.
[02:37:34.666 --> 02:37:35.787]  We're good to go.
[02:37:53.445 --> 02:37:54.386]  We're good to go.
[02:37:54.406 --> 02:37:55.326]  We're good to go.
[02:38:15.798 --> 02:38:18.880]  It's valuable, and they're going to let a mall be built here.
[02:38:18.920 --> 02:38:21.461]  They're going to give big agribusiness something over here.
[02:38:21.801 --> 02:38:31.205]  I mean, literally, this is the politicians grabbing most of the land in the state, the most valuable land in the state, with the natural resources, everything, to just give it to whoever they want.
[02:38:31.445 --> 02:38:35.067]  I mean, my family has a ranch that's a few miles off a major highway.
[02:38:35.367 --> 02:38:36.608]  And folks, this isn't a game.
[02:38:36.628 --> 02:38:37.328]  They're not playing.
[02:38:37.508 --> 02:38:39.649]  They're going to come to you and say, you're going to pay us.
[02:38:40.329 --> 02:38:43.210]  Some of the better deals I've seen, 50 cents on the dollar, what it's worth.
[02:38:43.510 --> 02:38:46.972]  If you don't immediately agree, they are allowed to grab your land.
[02:38:47.452 --> 02:38:47.712]  Right.
[02:38:47.832 --> 02:38:51.654]  And it's not just the 1,200 feet that's in this corridor path.
[02:38:52.234 --> 02:38:53.154]  You're exactly right.
[02:38:54.735 --> 02:39:02.218]  Zachary Senta has already paid the down payment money to reserve the concession rights, not only inside the corridor, but along the corridor.
[02:39:02.944 --> 02:39:09.987]  And they can take land that's outside the corridor if they want it for a hotel or for a shopping mall or whatever, just like you said.
[02:39:10.727 --> 02:39:21.632]  And a few people that I've seen at these meetings that are interested in how it's going to help the economics of their small town or their rural community.
[02:39:23.373 --> 02:39:30.056]  The prime example that I bring up in every one of these meetings when somebody asks that question is remember the interstate highway system.
[02:39:31.030 --> 02:39:36.243]  How you were told how it was going to just make an economic boom to these towns along that system, and it killed them.
[02:39:37.162 --> 02:39:39.283]  And this one's going to be worse because you have less access.
[02:39:39.383 --> 02:39:39.883]  Oh, wait a minute.
[02:39:39.943 --> 02:39:48.827]  This is exactly... If you want to see the model of the Trans-Texas Highway, which is really the NAFTA highways nationwide, 83 roads now coming under interstates.
[02:39:49.027 --> 02:39:50.207]  83 interstates have been designated.
[02:39:50.227 --> 02:39:54.849]  And then hundreds of roads in each state, depending on the size of the state, go to spp.gov and other sites.
[02:39:54.889 --> 02:39:55.769]  Go to Corridor Watch.
[02:39:56.410 --> 02:39:57.770]  And before you leave, you've got to give out your website.
[02:39:57.790 --> 02:40:00.291]  We've got links to it on infowars.com, so I'm very impressed.
[02:40:00.911 --> 02:40:02.852]  I thought I'd give you a donation.
[02:40:03.292 --> 02:40:04.573]  But to make a long story short...
[02:40:05.629 --> 02:40:09.392]  I was getting into the point about what these roads do.
[02:40:09.532 --> 02:40:14.415]  If you go up to Kansas, up out of Oklahoma, you'll drive 50, 60 miles.
[02:40:14.675 --> 02:40:15.936]  You cannot exit.
[02:40:16.156 --> 02:40:22.681]  There are huge dividers, and every few miles you'll be able to get past a divider and just look at a lower divider and you'll see beautiful ghost towns.
[02:40:23.021 --> 02:40:23.682]  We're good to go.
[02:40:36.989 --> 02:40:45.532]  They don't let you get off, and you're there driving down this thing, and they say the Trans-Texas Highway is going to take existing roads and block them off.
[02:40:45.952 --> 02:40:47.433]  Oh, folks are really going to love that.
[02:40:47.733 --> 02:40:53.995]  Yeah, those people live in rural communities that depend upon rural fire departments, volunteer fire departments, and rural EMS.
[02:40:54.556 --> 02:40:57.937]  It's the difference between stopping a heart attack and calling a hearse.
[02:40:58.522 --> 02:41:03.043]  Because they may have to go 20, 25 miles in each direction just to get to their location.
[02:41:03.524 --> 02:41:11.706]  You know, Rick Perry challenged every gubernatorial candidate I noticed in the statesman yesterday that if you have a better plan, submit it.
[02:41:12.386 --> 02:41:23.190]  Well, I submitted a better plan to TxDOT, and I'm going to personally submit it to Governor Perry on how we can get by without having to do anything with the roadways with simple high-speed rail,
[02:41:24.684 --> 02:41:26.225]  Well, listen, he knows what that means.
[02:41:26.545 --> 02:41:30.027]  And passenger rail from Dallas-Fort Worth to San Antonio to Houston and back.
[02:41:30.908 --> 02:41:32.529]  And then you never touch a highway.
[02:41:33.049 --> 02:41:34.070]  And this plan will work.
[02:41:34.590 --> 02:41:38.613]  This plan is economical and it will work, but I guarantee you he'll never mention it.
[02:41:39.013 --> 02:41:40.974]  Now, he's challenged for a better plan.
[02:41:41.275 --> 02:41:44.857]  I'm going to submit a better plan, but this is not Rick Perry.
[02:41:44.977 --> 02:41:49.020]  Everybody in this state knows Rick Perry's not smart enough to have conceived this.
[02:41:49.040 --> 02:41:49.480]  But that's true.
[02:41:49.480 --> 02:41:56.381]  That's the point I was making, is that they claim there's a challenge, knowing no one will ever hear the other challenges.
[02:41:56.661 --> 02:42:00.922]  So it's a claim like, I've got the best plan, I'm confident.
[02:42:00.962 --> 02:42:01.983]  But you're right.
[02:42:02.023 --> 02:42:05.583]  What we need is commuter rail between the major population centers.
[02:42:06.123 --> 02:42:10.424]  Instead, we're going to have it where it's all little rail inside cities nobody can use.
[02:42:10.704 --> 02:42:13.065]  That's another big part of the scam he's trying to push.
[02:42:13.105 --> 02:42:18.566]  Well, and all the major trucking industries told them before they ever started this project that for what it was going to cost them,
[02:42:19.269 --> 02:42:20.555]  That they couldn't afford to use it.
[02:42:20.957 --> 02:42:24.111]  But if they put up high-speed freight rail...
[02:42:24.730 --> 02:42:32.074]  From point A to point B, to where they could get their trailers from that point to that point, they take their trucks off the road and just use regional deliveries.
[02:42:32.514 --> 02:42:33.855]  And that has not been addressed.
[02:42:34.055 --> 02:42:35.776]  This is not going to facilitate that at all.
[02:42:35.816 --> 02:42:36.837]  Well, I'll tell you what's going to happen.
[02:42:37.037 --> 02:42:40.719]  Everybody from the north and everybody from the west, everybody is moving to Texas.
[02:42:40.839 --> 02:42:46.922]  We have gone from being way down there decades ago in population to being the second most populous state.
[02:42:47.002 --> 02:42:51.805]  We are going to surpass California in the next 10 to 15 years, even as California balloons.
[02:42:52.185 --> 02:42:52.425]  I agree.
[02:42:52.445 --> 02:42:52.645]  I agree.
[02:42:52.665 --> 02:42:54.426]  I mean, it's everything to facilitate corporate America.
[02:43:18.954 --> 02:43:20.255]  And nothing to facilitate.
[02:43:20.315 --> 02:43:21.877]  My interest is rural Texas.
[02:43:21.937 --> 02:43:25.280]  And nothing to facilitate to people that actually made this country.
[02:43:25.500 --> 02:43:30.424]  How do we beat the Transnefta highway system, the Texas corridors?
[02:43:30.464 --> 02:43:32.446]  How do we beat the Animal ID Act?
[02:43:32.586 --> 02:43:33.587]  Everybody's against it.
[02:43:33.947 --> 02:43:38.171]  I mean, again, you go to a meeting, 1,800 are there against it and 11 are there for it.
[02:43:38.731 --> 02:43:42.695]  At the place where Jimmy Vaughn and his wife Robin spoke out in Texas,
[02:43:43.844 --> 02:43:44.445]  Smithville.
[02:43:44.805 --> 02:43:50.610]  They're out there, and you know, Jimmy is a quiet guy, and he got up and screamed at them and said, how do you sleep at night?
[02:43:50.870 --> 02:43:51.791]  You're a bunch of traitors.
[02:43:52.011 --> 02:43:54.513]  I mean, if they can get somebody like that mad, you're right.
[02:43:55.174 --> 02:43:57.276]  People are going to get violent, which they're ready for.
[02:43:57.296 --> 02:44:05.102]  What's real interesting is in all the meetings that I made, the 21 meetings, there were actually four legislators that showed up at those meetings.
[02:44:05.643 --> 02:44:08.025]  None of them ever signed up to be acknowledged they were there.
[02:44:08.565 --> 02:44:11.868]  None of them ever spoke, but they all voted against these
[02:44:12.833 --> 02:44:18.714]  I mean, they all voted for the TTC, but they wouldn't explain to large groups of their constituents why.
[02:44:19.255 --> 02:44:26.996]  And so I pointed every one of them out in my three minutes to speak and challenged them to come up and tell their constituents why they voted for this.
[02:44:27.677 --> 02:44:28.377]  And they never did.
[02:44:29.157 --> 02:44:37.439]  You know, and when government won't take accountability for its actions in the face of its constituents,
[02:44:38.140 --> 02:44:39.040]  Then you have a problem.
[02:44:39.161 --> 02:44:46.304]  Well, we brought up during a break these electronic voting machines, and you were bringing up diebolts on employees going public, saying it's all a fraud.
[02:44:46.724 --> 02:44:50.166]  I mean, we really are catching these companies coast-to-coast engaging in fraud.
[02:44:50.206 --> 02:44:54.067]  The good news is they've only put it in 35% of the precincts in the country.
[02:44:54.368 --> 02:44:56.289]  The problem is they're racing to put them in everywhere.
[02:44:56.569 --> 02:45:03.512]  That's why before you didn't have politicians when 97% of people were against a major issue going, we don't care, and laughing at us.
[02:45:03.772 --> 02:45:05.773]  I mean, Mayor Will Wendell just laughed at everybody.
[02:45:06.425 --> 02:45:09.607]  Because he's got a bunch of idiot yuppies supporting him, but that's not who's electing him.
[02:45:09.888 --> 02:45:14.231]  I'm telling you, Dana DeDubois, the county clerk in Austin, Texas, there is no voting here.
[02:45:14.831 --> 02:45:18.193]  That's because they've got hard inner civic machines in, and we've caught them red-handed.
[02:45:18.413 --> 02:45:25.639]  And folks, if you think it's funny to have a group of people in control of your county and your city who've actually stolen your right to vote away, we're in deep trouble.
[02:45:25.659 --> 02:45:30.582]  We've got a small window to try to vote these people out before they get their machines in nationwide.
[02:45:30.822 --> 02:45:33.204]  Well, my challenge to Governor Perry...
[02:45:34.308 --> 02:45:40.972]  And his band of gangsters, well, whatever you want to call them, my opponent especially.
[02:45:40.992 --> 02:45:42.793]  Well, band of, use your tongue.
[02:45:42.933 --> 02:45:49.136]  If they're so, I think that they suffer from the A&I syndrome, the arrogance and ignorance syndrome.
[02:45:49.617 --> 02:46:01.083]  But if they are so confident in what they're doing is right, and that the majority of Texans believe in what they're doing is right, then I challenge them.
[02:46:02.310 --> 02:46:13.200]  To make paper balance available in every election in this state, every county, every precinct, for early voting and on November the 7th.
[02:46:13.481 --> 02:46:13.961]  That's a good idea.
[02:46:13.981 --> 02:46:23.490]  Where you can have true accountability as to whether or not the mass majority of this population in Texas believes in what they're doing or if they don't.
[02:46:23.630 --> 02:46:25.272]  Well, somebody's got to put some money towards this.
[02:46:25.312 --> 02:46:26.313]  I'll tell you how you can do it.
[02:46:26.353 --> 02:46:27.294]  We've tried this locally.
[02:46:27.954 --> 02:46:31.258]  What you do is, you've got to stay a few hundred feet away because of the laws, but you advertise it.
[02:46:31.278 --> 02:46:32.520]  You have nice little trucks there.
[02:46:32.820 --> 02:46:34.943]  And you go, listen, folks, we're doing a test.
[02:46:34.963 --> 02:46:42.171]  We're trying to get everybody that goes in here, or at least a large percentage of people that go in here, to vote over here because we're testing out these voting machines.
[02:46:43.072 --> 02:46:43.693]  The problem is...
[02:46:44.452 --> 02:46:49.454]  The county clerk and others will find out, and then the returns will be proper at those precincts.
[02:46:49.714 --> 02:46:50.494]  But that's what we've seen.
[02:46:50.514 --> 02:47:00.077]  You'll have precincts right next to where the Diebold or Hardener Civics machines aren't in, and over here people that should be losing in the polls are winning because they're an establishment, and then over here they're losing.
[02:47:00.657 --> 02:47:07.879]  It's like Howard Dean was winning everywhere where it wasn't Diebold in New Hampshire, but he was losing by 15 to 20 points everywhere where it was Diebold.
[02:47:08.140 --> 02:47:09.220]  Same thing with Schwarzenegger.
[02:47:09.540 --> 02:47:11.941]  I mean, folks, Schwarzenegger's down in the 30s in the polls.
[02:47:12.201 --> 02:47:14.141]  Watch, he's going to win probably as governor again.
[02:47:14.462 --> 02:47:18.343]  I'm telling you, folks, as hard as it is to admit to ourselves, there's fraud going on.
[02:47:19.103 --> 02:47:19.623]  I believe that.
[02:47:20.203 --> 02:47:20.763]  I believe that.
[02:47:20.983 --> 02:47:23.924]  But it's not going to stop until we stand up and do something about it.
[02:47:24.345 --> 02:47:25.605]  Well, I've got a plan for that.
[02:47:25.665 --> 02:47:29.026]  We need to have a petition drive in every major town and city.
[02:47:30.126 --> 02:47:40.075]  With those petition drives, the petition is to put an issue on the ballot to have a paper vote on recalling the electronic voting machines.
[02:47:40.515 --> 02:47:46.281]  Then you can go through the petition process, county by county, city by city, state by state, and remove these.
[02:47:46.681 --> 02:47:47.482]  I see that happening.
[02:47:47.902 --> 02:47:48.423]  I hope it does.
[02:47:49.073 --> 02:47:51.574]  I hope anything we can do to remove these machines.
[02:47:51.634 --> 02:47:54.436]  Final segment coming up, but Hank Gilbert, I'm really impressed.
[02:47:54.496 --> 02:47:56.877]  Please give us several times your website.
[02:47:57.197 --> 02:48:00.799]  www.hankgilbert.com And you go on that website.
[02:48:01.459 --> 02:48:03.380]  It has bio information.
[02:48:03.460 --> 02:48:06.561]  It has feeds from interviews just like this.
[02:48:07.182 --> 02:48:09.623]  Television, radio, newspaper articles.
[02:48:10.285 --> 02:48:10.545]  Right.
[02:48:10.565 --> 02:48:10.726]  Right.
[02:48:30.567 --> 02:48:32.068]  And pass that link on to everybody.
[02:48:32.108 --> 02:48:37.150]  We don't have millions for advertising, and this website is far much better than any advertising we could buy.
[02:48:37.170 --> 02:48:40.232]  Well, there's all these people mad about the highways and the rest of it.
[02:48:40.532 --> 02:48:41.413]  They need to support you.
[02:48:46.615 --> 02:48:49.817]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:50.157 --> 02:48:52.058]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:52.458 --> 02:49:00.082]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:00.799 --> 02:49:07.820]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:08.221 --> 02:49:19.703]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:19.963 --> 02:49:23.484]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:23.924 --> 02:49:25.864]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:26.184 --> 02:49:30.025]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:56.700 --> 02:50:00.201]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria,
[02:50:00.461 --> 02:50:04.683]  Sists, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:04.963 --> 02:50:08.884]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[02:50:09.124 --> 02:50:15.647]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:50:15.867 --> 02:50:21.369]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[02:50:21.589 --> 02:50:28.492]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.

[02:50:33.176 --> 02:50:34.157]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:50:44.676 --> 02:50:50.579]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:50:50.819 --> 02:50:53.080]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[02:50:53.261 --> 02:50:59.604]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[02:51:00.004 --> 02:51:00.624]  I think so too.
[02:51:15.512 --> 02:51:15.852]  We're good to go.
[02:51:52.006 --> 02:51:54.927]  Well, I won't back down.
[02:51:56.227 --> 02:51:59.048]  No, I won't back down.
[02:52:00.449 --> 02:52:07.491]  You can stand me up at the gates of hell, but I won't back down.
[02:52:07.531 --> 02:52:12.113]  Our entire birthright is being completely sold out and hijacked right now.
[02:52:12.153 --> 02:52:19.535]  The Democrats are involved in it as well, but Republicans are the top dogs, the main leaders, leaders of the pack, as they say, winding this country.
[02:52:20.140 --> 02:52:20.881]  And you need to get out.
[02:52:20.921 --> 02:52:22.322]  You need to vote for Hank Gilbert.
[02:52:22.963 --> 02:52:27.488]  Try to overpower these electronic voting machines to vote in all the areas where they're not in full control.
[02:52:28.582 --> 02:52:29.183]  Let's be honest.
[02:52:29.223 --> 02:52:32.365]  In some areas where Democrats are in control, they're thrown to the Democrats.
[02:52:32.425 --> 02:52:36.568]  It's like a fight over the machines, but Republicans are the dominant group over the machines.
[02:52:36.929 --> 02:52:39.330]  So get out there and vote at HankGilbert.com.
[02:52:39.370 --> 02:52:41.292]  We've got links to it on Infowars.com.
[02:52:41.332 --> 02:52:47.597]  A candidate for Texas Ag Commissioner, and that could really put a stake in the heart, having somebody up there to fight it as a bully pulpit.
[02:52:48.097 --> 02:52:50.199]  So nationwide, this is a very serious issue.
[02:52:50.619 --> 02:52:55.383]  Before we close with our guest here in the last few minutes, waning moments, please visit...
[02:52:56.366 --> 02:53:00.709]  Infowars.com and get tickets to the big Saturday event I'm going to have up in Dallas.
[02:53:00.729 --> 02:53:02.170]  First time I've had an event in Dallas.
[02:53:02.890 --> 02:53:04.271]  It's getting close to selling out.
[02:53:04.911 --> 02:53:07.713]  My new film, Terror Storm, will debut.
[02:53:07.813 --> 02:53:09.734]  Then I'll give a speech and take questions for an hour.
[02:53:10.174 --> 02:53:17.579]  Then Jim Mars, who of course wrote the film JFK and has written the new book that we're now carrying, The Terror Conspiracy.
[02:53:17.879 --> 02:53:19.160]  He's going to talk about JFK to 9-11.
[02:53:20.420 --> 02:53:21.281]  We're good to go.
[02:53:38.892 --> 02:53:39.353]  We're good to go.
[02:53:53.684 --> 02:53:55.024]  Or call till free to get tickets.
[02:53:55.044 --> 02:53:55.164]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:53:55.405 --> 02:53:59.306]  Hope to see you in Dallas at the historic and beautiful Lakewood Theater.
[02:53:59.486 --> 02:54:01.506]  It's a 1933 or 1934 built Art Deco beautiful theater.
[02:54:01.526 --> 02:54:03.587]  And again, it holds over 700 people and tickets.
[02:54:11.309 --> 02:54:11.930]  We're good to go.
[02:54:33.680 --> 02:54:44.069]  We were talking about a challenge to Perry, and you challenged the other gubernatorial candidates to challenge Perry to put his money where his mouth is and allow people who want a paper ballot to have one.
[02:54:44.569 --> 02:54:44.809]  Right.
[02:54:44.909 --> 02:54:53.056]  I mean, if Rick Perry is so sold on the fact that the people of this state are solidly behind him and his initiatives, then I...
[02:54:54.164 --> 02:54:54.644]  We're good to go.
[02:55:14.733 --> 02:55:16.115]  Paper ballots statewide.
[02:55:16.555 --> 02:55:20.420]  And let everybody be able to see the accountability of this election.
[02:55:20.480 --> 02:55:23.583]  And call your newspaper editors and say, why aren't you calling for this?
[02:55:23.623 --> 02:55:27.007]  Why aren't you doing more stories on these electronic voting machines?
[02:55:27.047 --> 02:55:31.212]  Because you're part of the local power structures in every single city.
[02:55:31.232 --> 02:55:32.434]  We've got about 40 seconds.
[02:55:32.874 --> 02:55:33.535]  We're good to go.
[02:55:50.778 --> 02:55:51.899]  Because people are so angry.
[02:55:51.939 --> 02:55:57.884]  That's the key, and support other candidates that are out there that are also fighting these two key issues.
[02:55:57.924 --> 02:55:59.385]  We're here on the front lines in Texas.
[02:55:59.705 --> 02:56:00.606]  We need your support.
[02:56:01.247 --> 02:56:03.488]  Thank you so much, Hank, for coming in and talking to us today.
[02:56:03.668 --> 02:56:04.689]  Thank you for letting us come.
[02:56:04.849 --> 02:56:05.270]  You bet.
[02:56:05.290 --> 02:56:14.897]  I'm going to try to support you, and I didn't bring any cash with me today, but I'm going to get your address, and I'm going to, tomorrow, drop a check in there for you to try to support you, and everybody should do that as well.
[02:56:15.178 --> 02:56:16.719]  All right, back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:16.779 --> 02:56:17.419]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:18.460 --> 02:56:20.002]  Get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:56:20.062 --> 02:56:21.043]  God bless you all!
