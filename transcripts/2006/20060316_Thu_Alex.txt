[00:00:15.092 --> 00:00:35.543]  Your own personal Jesus Someone to hear your prayers Someone who cares Your own personal Jesus
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:01:06.047]  Someone to hear your prayers Someone who's there Feeling unknown And you're all alone Flesh and bone By the telephone Lift up the receiver I'll make you a believer
[00:01:10.032 --> 00:01:37.100]  Take second best, put me to the test Things on your chest, you need to confess I will deliver, you know I'm a forgiver Reach out and touch faith Reach out and touch faith
[00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:42.940]  Big Brother.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.641]  Mainstream media.
[00:01:45.381 --> 00:01:46.482]  Government cover-ups.
[00:01:47.143 --> 00:01:47.943]  You want answers?
[00:01:48.704 --> 00:01:50.625]  Well, so does he.
[00:01:50.645 --> 00:01:53.948]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:01:54.448 --> 00:01:58.571]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:01:59.732 --> 00:02:01.313]  Music
[00:02:17.944 --> 00:02:24.066]  Welcome, my friends, all of our great listeners around the seven continents and the ships at sea.
[00:02:24.566 --> 00:02:26.007]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:02:26.047 --> 00:02:35.010]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours, or two hours, fifty, what, seven minutes to be precise.
[00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:42.051]  Coming up in the next hour, Christian radio host fired for criticizing Israel.
[00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:46.333]  Part of our ongoing series showing where the First Amendment is going in America.
[00:02:46.353 --> 00:02:51.395]  20-year host Dale Crowley told you can't talk about that.
[00:02:51.735 --> 00:02:54.837]  Doesn't matter if you've got high ratings that bring in support to the station.
[00:02:55.297 --> 00:02:56.978]  You're fired!
[00:02:58.438 --> 00:03:02.380]  So that's coming up in the next hour.
[00:03:03.741 --> 00:03:04.461]  In the meantime...
[00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:07.361]  Belarus says U.S.
[00:03:07.622 --> 00:03:11.362]  planned school bombings on Election Day.
[00:03:11.402 --> 00:03:12.483]  Are we to believe this?
[00:03:13.523 --> 00:03:20.325]  The Russians wrote the modern book on doing this, and so would the United States be involved in a bombing?
[00:03:20.565 --> 00:03:24.926]  Yes, certainly, to blame it on enemies, but Russia likes to do it too.
[00:03:25.026 --> 00:03:29.007]  The Belarusians, I guess you could call them, have been known to do it.
[00:03:29.027 --> 00:03:30.487]  I mean, who doesn't, really?
[00:03:30.567 --> 00:03:33.728]  So we'll have to research this and see.
[00:03:35.074 --> 00:03:39.215]  Hindsight normally will let us learn if it's the case, but we're not sure right now.
[00:03:39.255 --> 00:03:41.696]  But I will get into this article out of Moscow News.
[00:03:42.496 --> 00:03:45.878]  Approval ratings for Lord Bush have dropped to its all-time high.
[00:03:46.418 --> 00:03:48.258]  All-time low is 33%.
[00:03:48.698 --> 00:03:52.260]  And that's even in big establishment polls.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.480]  A lot of the polls we trust.
[00:03:54.128 --> 00:03:57.191]  Show that it's even lower than that.
[00:03:57.251 --> 00:04:11.366]  So Bush in new speeches today and in press conferences, his minions will be holding over the next week to restate the preemptive strike long war strategy, the endless war.
[00:04:12.508 --> 00:04:15.611]  And no, that's not a line from the four horsemen.
[00:04:16.665 --> 00:04:20.108]  Metallica song, Kill Em All, that's a line from Bush.
[00:04:20.168 --> 00:04:24.592]  Just endless war on earth, never ending war.
[00:04:25.633 --> 00:04:26.814]  It's what would Jesus do?
[00:04:26.894 --> 00:04:31.618]  Certainly not what George Bush is doing, though he's got a lot of good Christian people fooled.
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.125]  Chinese Prime Minister downplays China threat, telling us that everything's okay, we just go back to sleep.
[00:04:39.625 --> 00:04:44.189]  Big news, Congressman writes White House, the President knowingly signed law that didn't pass.
[00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.272]  The answer is, of course you did.
[00:04:46.653 --> 00:04:48.795]  The hoaxes just get bigger and bigger.
[00:04:50.678 --> 00:04:53.802]  And we've got some amazing audio clips coming up as well.
[00:04:53.942 --> 00:04:55.645]  You'll want to stay with us.
[00:04:56.426 --> 00:04:57.828]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[00:05:02.398 --> 00:05:05.402]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:05:05.743 --> 00:05:14.554]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:05:14.895 --> 00:05:19.561]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:05:20.021 --> 00:05:26.748]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:05:27.148 --> 00:05:38.939]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:43.864]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:05:44.044 --> 00:05:46.366]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:05:51.111 --> 00:05:52.312]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:05.411]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:06:05.671 --> 00:06:06.372]  Hello, my friends.
[00:06:06.472 --> 00:06:07.272]  Alex Jones here.
[00:06:07.612 --> 00:06:12.275]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:06:12.616 --> 00:06:19.360]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.661]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:06:21.861 --> 00:06:24.702]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:06:24.802 --> 00:06:29.463]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:06:29.663 --> 00:06:34.045]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:06:34.305 --> 00:06:41.527]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:06:41.788 --> 00:06:44.208]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:06:44.368 --> 00:06:46.109]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:50.214]  That's InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139 or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:07:01.593 --> 00:07:03.055]  Hey folks, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:07:03.395 --> 00:07:07.359]  You've all heard me on the radio talking about the importance of investing in precious metals.
[00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.244]  I feel it's time for me to talk about the importance of investing in your health.
[00:07:11.624 --> 00:07:15.188]  I was presented with the opportunity to try TriVibes from TriVortex.
[00:07:15.588 --> 00:07:20.454]  I was a bit hesitant of the idea of absorbing vitamins by wearing them rather than ingesting them.
[00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:26.559]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:33.024]  I now wear my TriVibes bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever, not only physically, but also mentally.
[00:07:33.344 --> 00:07:39.109]  TriVortex also offers amazingly beneficial and beautiful jewelry worn by the women around the office daily.
[00:07:39.549 --> 00:07:40.729]  TriVortex is amazing.
[00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:42.150]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:47.672]  Try TriVortex yourself and have fun and learn with the test found on TriVortex.com.
[00:07:47.872 --> 00:07:51.333]  That's T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com.
[00:07:51.593 --> 00:07:52.914]  Or call my friend Brian at 619-884-1455.
[00:07:52.954 --> 00:07:53.234]  That's 619-884-1455.
[00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:06.730]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:08.450]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.151 --> 00:08:10.271]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.931 --> 00:08:11.731]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.491 --> 00:08:13.371]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.391 --> 00:08:17.992]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.232 --> 00:08:22.013]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:23.113 --> 00:08:25.834]  Well, today's broadcast is going to be a little bit different.
[00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:27.794]  We'll cover all the normal staples.
[00:08:27.834 --> 00:08:29.074]  Government-sponsored terror.
[00:08:29.595 --> 00:08:30.535]  The New World Order.
[00:08:30.575 --> 00:08:31.555]  The Satanic Elite.
[00:08:32.446 --> 00:08:34.428]  The real world that surrounds us.
[00:08:34.528 --> 00:08:41.755]  But Cruiserweight, who I'm a big fan of, I played part of one of their songs yesterday, won a big award at the Austin Awards last night.
[00:08:41.775 --> 00:08:45.679]  I'd incidentally gotten some complaints that I hadn't aired the whole thing by listeners.
[00:08:45.699 --> 00:08:50.484]  So we'll play the whole song later in this hour that I never got to yesterday.
[00:08:50.524 --> 00:08:52.326]  We just played about two minutes of it.
[00:08:53.141 --> 00:09:09.193]  And also you'll get my review of the dystopic science fiction Philip K. Dick novel for the first time made into a full-length feature rotoscoped Hollywood production up on the big silver screen.
[00:09:09.793 --> 00:09:13.176]  I had a chance to go watch it last night at a sneak peek.
[00:09:13.196 --> 00:09:14.677]  It won't be out until July.
[00:09:15.635 --> 00:09:17.175]  And I was just blown away.
[00:09:17.215 --> 00:09:18.756]  I mean, it is avant-garde.
[00:09:19.176 --> 00:09:20.256]  What is avant-garde?
[00:09:20.456 --> 00:09:20.776]  New.
[00:09:20.956 --> 00:09:21.597]  Something new.
[00:09:21.917 --> 00:09:23.117]  Before its time.
[00:09:24.597 --> 00:09:27.138]  It's got government-sponsored terror in it.
[00:09:27.738 --> 00:09:35.080]  If you closely follow what's happening, the government, in conjunction with private corporations, ships in the drugs.
[00:09:36.041 --> 00:09:41.202]  The police state is a mechanized control grid to control the population.
[00:09:42.086 --> 00:09:55.654]  And basically, it is put out by Warner Independent, and behind the scenes, it's been quite a task to get this through, but it is definitely anti-New World Order.
[00:09:56.275 --> 00:10:00.797]  It's got some of the biggest stars in Hollywood in it, and believe me, they're anti-New World Order.
[00:10:00.837 --> 00:10:01.758]  It's a labor of love.
[00:10:02.078 --> 00:10:05.500]  You know, Keanu Reeves makes around $50 million for his movies.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:10.143]  He made $200 million on his last two Matrix films, and he made...
[00:10:11.897 --> 00:10:13.398]  What does it say?
[00:10:13.498 --> 00:10:19.362]  He was paid $70,000 to make this film for people that shoot their mouths off and go, Oh, it's Hollywood establishment.
[00:10:20.523 --> 00:10:23.865]  This film would normally cost about $80 million to make conservatively.
[00:10:23.925 --> 00:10:26.646]  You can go read major industry publications that are reporting that.
[00:10:26.667 --> 00:10:31.830]  It was made for $8.9 million with an original budget of $6.9 million.
[00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:40.255]  Anyways, my big review of it, and of course I haven't really mentioned or talked about in the last review we did,
[00:10:41.144 --> 00:10:41.584]  We're good to go.
[00:11:02.153 --> 00:11:06.796]  And, of course, I can mention a lot of the other people in Hollywood that are waking up to what's happening big time right now.
[00:11:07.137 --> 00:11:08.598]  The globalists are in trouble.
[00:11:08.638 --> 00:11:12.440]  They're having trouble controlling their own system at every level.
[00:11:12.481 --> 00:11:16.764]  There is a revolution going on right now.
[00:11:18.865 --> 00:11:26.811]  Boston Legal has put out a lot of pro-New World Order stuff in the past, and what they're having to do now is put out some anti-New World Order stuff,
[00:11:28.453 --> 00:11:28.933]  We're good to go.
[00:11:57.302 --> 00:11:59.104]  At the end, which is part of the false paradigm.
[00:11:59.404 --> 00:12:00.585]  So let's roll that.
[00:12:00.625 --> 00:12:01.005]  Here it is.
[00:12:04.268 --> 00:12:05.029]  This is in the court.
[00:12:09.052 --> 00:12:18.320]  When the weapons of mass destruction thing turned out not to be true, I expected the American people to rise up.
[00:12:21.223 --> 00:12:21.603]  They didn't.
[00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:38.751]  Then, when the Abu Ghraib torture thing surfaced, and it was revealed that our government participated in rendition, a practice where we kidnap people and turn them over to regimes who specialize in torture, I was sure then the American people would be heard from.
[00:12:38.971 --> 00:12:39.731]  We stood mute.
[00:12:40.352 --> 00:12:49.158]  Then came the news that we jailed thousands of so-called terrorist suspects, locked them up without the right to a trial or even the right to confront their accusers.
[00:12:49.558 --> 00:12:51.260]  Certainly, we would never stand for that.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:51.700]  We did.
[00:12:52.794 --> 00:13:02.018]  And now it's been discovered the executive branch has been conducting massive, illegal, domestic surveillance on its own citizens.
[00:13:02.399 --> 00:13:03.439]  You and me.
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:09.302]  And I at least consoled myself that finally, finally, the American people will have had enough.
[00:13:11.143 --> 00:13:11.963]  Evidently, we haven't.
[00:13:12.824 --> 00:13:17.846]  In fact, if the people of this country have spoken the messages, we're okay with it all.
[00:13:19.136 --> 00:13:30.445]  Torture, warrantless search and seizures, illegal wiretappings, prison without a fair trial, or any trial, war on false pretenses.
[00:13:31.326 --> 00:13:34.068]  We as a citizenry are apparently not offended.
[00:13:34.668 --> 00:13:36.990]  There are no demonstrations on college campuses.
[00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:41.033]  In fact, there's no clear indication that young people even seem to notice.
[00:13:42.194 --> 00:13:44.356]  Well, Melissa Hughes noticed.
[00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:56.752]  Now, you might think, instead of withholding her taxes, she could have protested the old-fashioned way, made a placard and demonstrated at a presidential or vice-presidential appearance.
[00:13:56.792 --> 00:13:58.352]  But we've lost the right to that as well.
[00:13:58.752 --> 00:14:06.714]  The Secret Service can now declare free speech zones to contain, control, and in effect, criminalize protests.
[00:14:07.094 --> 00:14:09.614]  Stop for a second and try to fathom that.
[00:14:10.995 --> 00:14:12.255]  At a presidential rally...
[00:14:13.075 --> 00:14:15.277]  Parade or appearance.
[00:14:15.957 --> 00:14:18.739]  If you have on a supportive t-shirt, you can be there.
[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:22.682]  If you're wearing or carrying something in protest, you can be removed.
[00:14:23.063 --> 00:14:24.884]  This in the United States of America.
[00:14:25.164 --> 00:14:27.606]  This in the United States of America.
[00:14:27.866 --> 00:14:30.248]  Is Melissa Hughes the only one embarrassed?
[00:14:35.672 --> 00:14:39.235]  Mr. Shaw, that's a chair for witnesses only.
[00:14:39.616 --> 00:14:42.858]  Really long speeches make me so tired sometimes.
[00:14:43.168 --> 00:14:44.391]  Please get out of the chair.
[00:14:44.672 --> 00:14:46.035]  Actually, I'm sick and tired.
[00:14:46.155 --> 00:14:47.639]  Get out of the chair!
[00:14:47.799 --> 00:14:50.807]  And what I'm most sick and tired of...
[00:14:52.990 --> 00:15:00.856]  Is how every time somebody disagrees with how the government is running things, he or she is labeled un-American.
[00:15:00.916 --> 00:15:01.997]  Evidently, it's speech time.
[00:15:02.097 --> 00:15:04.159]  And speech in this country is free, you hack.
[00:15:04.479 --> 00:15:05.240]  Free for me.
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:06.161]  Free for you.
[00:15:06.421 --> 00:15:10.084]  Free for Melissa Hughes to stand up to her government and say, Stick it!
[00:15:10.224 --> 00:15:10.845]  Objection!
[00:15:10.965 --> 00:15:15.909]  I object to governments abusing its power to squash the constitutional freedoms of its citizenry.
[00:15:16.089 --> 00:15:17.770]  And God forbid anybody challenge it.
[00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:19.131]  They're smeared as being a heretic.
[00:15:19.331 --> 00:15:20.913]  Melissa Hughes is an American.
[00:15:21.193 --> 00:15:22.374]  Melissa Hughes...
[00:15:22.534 --> 00:15:23.895]  Melissa Hughes is an American.
[00:15:24.175 --> 00:15:26.676]  Melissa Hughes is an American!
[00:15:26.856 --> 00:15:33.300]  Mr. Shaw, unless you have anything new and fresh to say, please sit down.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:38.602]  You've breached the decorum of my courtroom with all this hooting.
[00:15:46.866 --> 00:15:48.927]  Last night, I went to bed with a book.
[00:15:49.988 --> 00:15:50.949]  Not as much fun as a 29-year-old.
[00:15:52.498 --> 00:15:55.359]  But the book contained a speech by Adlai Stevenson.
[00:15:55.579 --> 00:15:56.040]  The year was 1952.
[00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:02.723]  He said, The tragedy of our day is the climate of fear in which we live.
[00:16:03.263 --> 00:16:04.784]  And fear breeds repression.
[00:16:05.524 --> 00:16:13.628]  Too often, sinister threats to the Bill of Rights, to freedom of the mind, are concealed under the patriotic cloak of anti-communism.
[00:16:17.489 --> 00:16:20.631]  Today, it's the cloak of anti-terrorism.
[00:16:22.521 --> 00:16:28.124]  Stevenson also remarked, it's far easier to fight for principles than to live up to them.
[00:16:33.086 --> 00:16:37.489]  I know we are all afraid.
[00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:45.453]  But the Bill of Rights, we have to live up to that.
[00:16:46.533 --> 00:16:47.514]  We simply must.
[00:16:50.375 --> 00:16:51.876]  That's all Melissa Hughes was trying to say.
[00:16:53.417 --> 00:16:54.378]  She was speaking for you.
[00:16:57.221 --> 00:17:01.505]  I would ask you now to go back to that room and speak for her.
[00:17:01.525 --> 00:17:05.269]  All right, folks.
[00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:11.435]  Now, did you pick up on the propaganda laced in there?
[00:17:11.475 --> 00:17:16.600]  I don't know if this is on purpose or by design or if the people are just organically conditioned to the false paradigm.
[00:17:17.842 --> 00:17:21.523]  But he tells us, even though he's the good guy, that people don't care and there aren't demonstrations.
[00:17:22.003 --> 00:17:22.824]  Well, that's not true.
[00:17:22.864 --> 00:17:29.686]  There are gigantic demonstrations going on every day all over this country, and there are little ones going on every hour.
[00:17:31.647 --> 00:17:43.651]  But the writers, I guess, in New York who wrote this, or Boston or L.A., wherever they're at, they don't know because they watch television, and the television most of the time doesn't cover demonstrations now.
[00:17:45.965 --> 00:17:47.786]  So we're told we're apathetic and we don't care.
[00:17:47.826 --> 00:17:49.607]  Now, I agree, we don't care enough.
[00:17:50.747 --> 00:17:52.008]  Then we have Adlai Stevens.
[00:17:52.288 --> 00:17:55.449]  Oh, yes, and how the good little commies are fighting the evil.
[00:17:55.589 --> 00:18:06.434]  No, our government funded communism as a command-and-control centralizing system to have a false bipolar militarization between Russia and the U.S.
[00:18:06.494 --> 00:18:08.474]  That's in their now-declassified official plans.
[00:18:08.875 --> 00:18:11.976]  They gave them the A-bombs, the hydrogen bombs, the weapons, everything.
[00:18:12.236 --> 00:18:14.177]  He was Uncle Joe Stalin during World War II.
[00:18:16.718 --> 00:18:25.203]  And then when people like McCarthy got deeper than the little phoniness of communism and found out our army was funding it, boom, he got hung out to dry real quick.
[00:18:25.503 --> 00:18:28.425]  And the fun little red baiting and chasing the reds ended.
[00:18:28.685 --> 00:18:32.847]  She was being used as a climate of not having free speech and going after the left in America.
[00:18:33.148 --> 00:18:40.592]  But when the commie hunters found out that it was really a controlled system by the government controlling both sides, it ended real quick.
[00:18:41.732 --> 00:18:45.975]  Oh yeah, the red hunting was going to get so bad there'd be no free speech in America and they weren't looking for reds.
[00:18:47.822 --> 00:18:51.908]  And we've now proven that the documents have been declassified in the US and Russia.
[00:18:55.433 --> 00:18:56.254]  So there's that.
[00:18:56.554 --> 00:18:58.737]  It's always more sophisticated than we've been told.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:00.300]  And...
[00:19:02.098 --> 00:19:05.421]  He also lays down, hey, you can't protest now.
[00:19:05.661 --> 00:19:08.003]  He says it's bad, but he acts like it's legitimate.
[00:19:08.023 --> 00:19:11.065]  Well, you can't protest now because we've got the Secret Service saying no.
[00:19:11.346 --> 00:19:16.750]  It isn't just when the president goes somewhere, it's any protected official, and now they've changed it in patriotic expansion.
[00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:17.791]  Bush is about to sign.
[00:19:19.392 --> 00:19:20.453]  It was passed last week.
[00:19:21.233 --> 00:19:23.715]  And it says in there, no one even need be there.
[00:19:23.735 --> 00:19:26.778]  They're a new national police force, quote, in infrastructure protection.
[00:19:27.738 --> 00:19:29.840]  We're talking years in prison, million dollar fines.
[00:19:31.551 --> 00:19:32.251]  Spread it around.
[00:20:02.148 --> 00:20:11.215]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[00:20:11.455 --> 00:20:22.703]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:20:23.024 --> 00:20:28.748]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:20:28.988 --> 00:20:29.648]  We're good to go.
[00:20:53.481 --> 00:20:53.581]  803-4438.
[00:20:53.621 --> 00:20:54.924]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:21:00.757 --> 00:21:06.981]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:21:07.441 --> 00:21:15.206]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:21:15.567 --> 00:21:23.432]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:21:23.732 --> 00:21:28.475]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:21:28.795 --> 00:21:37.881]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:21:38.221 --> 00:21:39.402]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:39.462 --> 00:21:43.545]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:21:43.965 --> 00:21:48.368]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:21:48.868 --> 00:21:51.390]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:53.971]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:54.111 --> 00:21:57.532]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:00.853 --> 00:22:03.893]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:04.133 --> 00:22:13.116]  Did you know that the Lenin School of Political Warfare has laid down a plan for a third world war that will destroy both Christianity and Communism at the same time?
[00:22:13.883 --> 00:22:19.366]  From the rubbles of this war, the Illuminati will establish their world government, prophesied in Revelation chapter 13.
[00:22:20.827 --> 00:22:30.792]  Communism said they would pretend to collapse, and when America had begun to disarm, the combined communist world would launch a surprise attack and smash us with their clenched fists.
[00:22:31.607 --> 00:22:38.753]  We'd like to show you how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:39.474 --> 00:22:40.935]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:40.955 --> 00:22:42.177]  That's 1-800-516-8736 to request your subscription.
[00:22:42.197 --> 00:22:42.797]  Call now.
[00:22:42.817 --> 00:22:45.379]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:22:58.832 --> 00:23:00.893]  Gee, honey, those new sandals look great on you.
[00:23:01.114 --> 00:23:03.335]  And look, they show off my new toenails, too.
[00:23:03.655 --> 00:23:04.316]  New toenails?
[00:23:04.696 --> 00:23:05.696]  What happened to the old ones?
[00:23:06.677 --> 00:23:09.379]  Well, they're not really new, just clear and healthy looking.
[00:23:09.899 --> 00:23:11.320]  Remember how embarrassed I was?
[00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:14.142]  They were so discolored, really awful looking.
[00:23:14.362 --> 00:23:15.743]  Well, they sure look clear now.
[00:23:16.183 --> 00:23:17.864]  Gosh, I wish I could wear sandals again.
[00:23:18.024 --> 00:23:19.385]  My toenails are a disaster.
[00:23:19.425 --> 00:23:22.247]  Look, this one looks white, and that one's thick and yellow.
[00:23:22.447 --> 00:23:23.668]  Well, here's my secret.
[00:23:24.253 --> 00:23:25.294]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:23:25.774 --> 00:23:29.837]  It clears out yellowing keratin debris, the source of nail discoloration.
[00:23:30.557 --> 00:23:31.438]  Ah, so that's it.
[00:23:31.698 --> 00:23:34.239]  I've got ugly keratin debris built up under my nails.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.181]  And Non-X Nail Gel gets rid of it.
[00:23:36.661 --> 00:23:39.683]  Now, you'll need to use it every day, but clear nails are worth it.
[00:23:40.123 --> 00:23:40.663]  You bet.
[00:23:40.904 --> 00:23:45.006]  You know, when we go to the beach this summer, my toenails are going to look just as good as yours do.
[00:23:45.146 --> 00:23:46.687]  Thanks to Nonex Nail Gel.
[00:23:47.067 --> 00:23:48.207]  Nonex Nail Gel.
[00:23:48.367 --> 00:23:50.048]  For clear, healthy-looking nails.
[00:23:50.428 --> 00:23:55.511]  Now at Walgreens, Rite Aid, Eckerd, Brooks, Longs, Duane Reade, and Walmart.
[00:23:55.711 --> 00:23:56.812]  In the foot care section.
[00:24:01.514 --> 00:24:06.537]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:07.336 --> 00:24:09.698]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:10.978 --> 00:24:16.882]  At the Austin Music Awards last night, this is from San Angelo.
[00:24:17.943 --> 00:24:19.564]  Many others won awards.
[00:24:19.584 --> 00:24:22.165]  I'm going to read part of this article later.
[00:24:24.719 --> 00:24:29.802]  The best alternative punk band is Cruiserweight, and again, they're fighting the New World Order.
[00:24:30.222 --> 00:24:39.808]  This is an example of what young people are able to do, or anyone for that matter, when they get out there and start taking action at just every level of the Infowar.
[00:24:40.448 --> 00:24:44.351]  And people complain that I haven't played the whole song, so go ahead and roll it right now.
[00:24:44.371 --> 00:24:45.531]  We'll try to get it all in right now. ...
[00:24:58.757 --> 00:25:13.590]  You can't lift people up When you're standing on their toes If you want to ease the masses Use your tongue for something apropos Otherwise, save the speeches
[00:25:24.307 --> 00:25:50.269]  Just because it's liquid Doesn't make it water We all know your nice house Doesn't make you clean Just because it's liquid Doesn't make it water You push your weight around But have you paid your dues?
[00:25:50.649 --> 00:25:51.169]  There's a threat
[00:26:20.416 --> 00:26:44.022]  Then wave their rights And wave goodbye Ultraviolet burning everyone Outrage fatigue is spreading in But at least I know I'm free Just because it's liquid
[00:26:48.908 --> 00:26:50.731]  We're good to go.
[00:27:24.322 --> 00:27:26.543]  We're good to go.
[00:27:26.604 --> 00:27:27.264]  We're good to go.
[00:27:54.209 --> 00:27:55.851]  We're good to go.
[00:28:25.583 --> 00:28:42.456]  And you, you don't use your phone Because you are disposable Disposable, we know All the safe living quarters Are crumbling one by one Crumbling one by one
[00:29:12.537 --> 00:29:13.598]  All right, cruiserweight.
[00:29:13.638 --> 00:29:15.439]  A threat of a threat of a threat.
[00:29:15.459 --> 00:29:15.859]  That's what they do.
[00:29:15.879 --> 00:29:19.960]  Well, there's a threat that there could be a threat that they'd have a weapon and then threaten us with it.
[00:29:20.621 --> 00:29:21.661]  So we're going to attack them.
[00:29:22.382 --> 00:29:23.162]  Oh, that's freedom!
[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:27.521]  And then you find out who really is carrying out the terror attacks.
[00:29:27.541 --> 00:29:33.324]  You find out who the real threat is, and it's exactly those who have the motive to begin with.
[00:29:34.364 --> 00:29:36.145]  The Arabs don't have a motive to attack us.
[00:29:36.165 --> 00:29:38.586]  Those nations don't have the capacity to do it.
[00:29:39.967 --> 00:29:40.227]  No.
[00:29:41.207 --> 00:29:42.788]  You know, and your guts is behind it.
[00:29:43.148 --> 00:29:46.910]  We'll plunge into the international national news when we get back.
[00:29:50.872 --> 00:29:51.832]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.272 --> 00:29:53.773]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.782 --> 00:29:57.463]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:24.517 --> 00:30:43.706]  The Berkey Security Pack is important every day and a must during emergencies because it provides purified water, long-term low-energy lighting, backup battery power for your Berkey LEDs, free long-term solar power for communications devices such as radios, walkie-talkies, and cell phones, as well as power for small applications.
[00:30:43.927 --> 00:30:47.528]  Get the one-stop solution for your emergency and everyday needs.
[00:30:47.688 --> 00:30:50.370]  The Berkey Security Pack, a retail value of $518 for only $399.
[00:30:53.191 --> 00:30:56.932]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:30:57.532 --> 00:30:58.973]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:31:00.353 --> 00:31:04.815]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[00:31:05.075 --> 00:31:08.676]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[00:31:08.816 --> 00:31:16.959]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[00:31:17.179 --> 00:31:22.801]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[00:31:23.121 --> 00:31:28.365]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[00:31:28.625 --> 00:31:30.707]  This is why you need the filter mag.
[00:31:30.987 --> 00:31:43.136]  The filter mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[00:31:43.356 --> 00:31:47.780]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[00:31:48.001 --> 00:31:48.941]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:31:49.142 --> 00:31:50.763]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[00:31:50.883 --> 00:31:52.685]  That's FilterMag.com.
[00:31:52.945 --> 00:31:53.406]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[00:31:53.426 --> 00:31:53.626]  That's 800-345-8376.
[00:32:00.692 --> 00:32:04.014]  And now a word from Dr. Patricia Margaitis from Stem Enhance.
[00:32:04.434 --> 00:32:08.596]  I want to first thank the wonderful GCN listeners for supporting Stem Enhance.
[00:32:09.117 --> 00:32:16.501]  Now know that your own stem cells are your body's maintenance glue, and Stem Enhance makes sure that more of them show up for work every day.
[00:32:16.943 --> 00:32:20.925]  The truth is, the more stem cells you have in your bloodstream, the greater your health.
[00:32:21.305 --> 00:32:34.753]  If you believe there is something more for you, have a strong work ethic, and wish to participate in the monumental increase in the cause for natural health while gaining financial independence and monthly cash flow, then you are the right person.
[00:32:35.173 --> 00:32:38.555]  I personally invite you to join me as a distributor of stem enhancers.
[00:32:38.955 --> 00:32:43.196]  I am committed to personally make sure you receive the tools needed to succeed.
[00:32:43.536 --> 00:32:46.477]  Remember, the first rule of success, you must show up.
[00:32:46.617 --> 00:32:49.918]  Call me, Dr. Patricia Margitis, at 860-567-7744.
[00:32:49.978 --> 00:32:51.479]  That number again, 860-567-7744.
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:29.117]  Coming up, my review of a scanner darkly when I, uh...
[00:33:30.006 --> 00:33:37.171]  I saw a sneak peek of, months before it's released, the first time the full film's been shown to a movie theater audience.
[00:33:39.293 --> 00:33:40.894]  Total anti-New World Order film.
[00:33:41.014 --> 00:33:43.476]  Just the coup de grace of anti-New World Order films.
[00:33:44.017 --> 00:33:45.097]  Totally avant-garde.
[00:33:45.157 --> 00:33:47.679]  Totally groundbreaking.
[00:33:49.258 --> 00:33:55.403]  Penetrating into serious exploration of filmmaking, and I'm just blown away that I'm involved in this film.
[00:33:55.743 --> 00:33:58.966]  I was so happy last night after I had a chance to see it on the big screen.
[00:33:59.346 --> 00:34:03.089]  Kurt, Joel, Chris, Ivan, many others, your calls are coming up.
[00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:08.134]  I want to get into MySpace is the Trojan horse of Internet censorship.
[00:34:08.154 --> 00:34:11.336]  We talked about this some yesterday, but now we put an article out on it.
[00:34:11.376 --> 00:34:12.878]  Also, Bush approval rating falls to 33%.
[00:34:13.258 --> 00:34:14.038]  Congress earns rare praise.
[00:34:14.059 --> 00:34:14.159]  This...
[00:34:19.298 --> 00:34:22.019]  Out of the Pew Research Center, put on one of these big polls.
[00:34:23.839 --> 00:34:29.121]  And there's a really scary report here where Bush signed a bill that hadn't been passed.
[00:34:30.401 --> 00:34:38.364]  Not only is Bush saying that if you don't pass a law like the Patriot Act expansion, I will just enforce it without having a law.
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:40.781]  That's called lawlessness.
[00:34:40.821 --> 00:34:44.482]  And when a leader engages in lawlessness, it's called despotism.
[00:34:44.882 --> 00:34:46.223]  It's called a tyrant.
[00:34:46.403 --> 00:34:46.863]  Tyranny.
[00:34:47.143 --> 00:34:49.304]  A tyrant carries out a tyranny.
[00:34:49.484 --> 00:34:52.066]  They carry it out upon the population.
[00:34:52.706 --> 00:34:53.306]  The serfs.
[00:34:53.366 --> 00:34:53.946]  The slaves.
[00:34:55.947 --> 00:35:03.330]  And we've got him at these signing ceremonies where he signs bills and then says, Well, the bill says this, but I'm ordering the executive with my statement.
[00:35:03.551 --> 00:35:06.692]  Speaking like Zeus or like Ramses or something.
[00:35:08.107 --> 00:35:13.110]  Or Nebuchadnezzar, that he is just going to, this is what we're actually going to do with this.
[00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:15.231]  And there's lawyers there all writing it down.
[00:35:16.852 --> 00:35:18.193]  As if that isn't bad enough.
[00:35:18.373 --> 00:35:27.578]  Or, okay, I don't care if it's five years in prison and huge fines if we don't go through the FISA court, which violates the Fourth Amendment to begin with, but at least it's something.
[00:35:28.659 --> 00:35:35.603]  Rubber stamp for just giant warrantless fishing expedition letters.
[00:35:35.623 --> 00:35:37.684]  It's kind of like a letter from the king to do whatever you want.
[00:35:40.473 --> 00:35:42.834]  No, that's not bad enough where he says he's above the law.
[00:35:42.994 --> 00:35:53.939]  Now, and the evidence is starting to emerge, it may not just be this huge multi-million dollar spending package, but it looks like he may be doing it in other cases, and congressmen are writing letters to the White House going, what are you doing?
[00:35:54.479 --> 00:35:58.680]  We don't pass laws now and you just get the bills and have public signing ceremonies?
[00:35:59.781 --> 00:36:02.402]  I mean, we're entering a twilight zone.
[00:36:02.422 --> 00:36:07.124]  I keep saying this, but I mean, every day it gets more twilight zone.
[00:36:09.232 --> 00:36:13.174]  We're like a ship getting into more and more enchanted waters.
[00:36:13.194 --> 00:36:19.776]  It's just getting stranger and stranger and stranger and weirder.
[00:36:19.796 --> 00:36:22.137]  And I'm like, is this actually happening?
[00:36:23.058 --> 00:36:32.201]  Did John Yoo get up in front of the CFR top Bush lawyer and say they can torture small children sexually in front of their parents?
[00:36:33.022 --> 00:36:34.182]  Yes, he did.
[00:36:36.463 --> 00:36:37.403]  Can I believe that?
[00:36:37.523 --> 00:36:38.984]  No, I'm having trouble
[00:36:41.532 --> 00:36:48.013]  Can the Chicago Tribune have front page articles about lobbyists for the white slave trade?
[00:36:49.013 --> 00:36:52.854]  And how no one's stopping them and how it's illegal but the government just lets it happen?
[00:36:53.914 --> 00:36:55.415]  Yes, that's really going on.
[00:36:57.355 --> 00:37:09.357]  Do White House memos get released where they openly say we're going to stage attacks on our aircraft and we're going to produce fake WMD dossiers and it's public and the White House doesn't deny it and no one gets in trouble?
[00:37:12.537 --> 00:37:23.724]  Can you go to the CIA's own website, though they've removed some of it, still a lot of it's up there, where they admit they carry out terror attacks and brag about it and how great it's worked in the past and read the declassified documents by Kermit Roosevelt and many others.
[00:37:26.606 --> 00:37:27.707]  Yes, you can go do that.
[00:37:29.668 --> 00:37:31.609]  I mean, there's so many things.
[00:37:31.689 --> 00:37:35.932]  And now Bush is just signing huge spending packages that haven't even been passed.
[00:37:37.162 --> 00:37:48.516]  See, we live in the world, as I said to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts yesterday, father of Reaganomics, chief economist for the Treasury Department under Ronald Reagan, one of the icons of true conservatism.
[00:37:49.878 --> 00:37:53.643]  As he said on this radio show yesterday, it's a completely lawless criminal government.
[00:37:56.064 --> 00:38:04.690]  That may carry out terror attacks to continue what they're doing, but I said, isn't it just a world where hoaxes are seen as reality, and reality is scoffed at?
[00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:06.130]  And he said, yes, that's exactly it.
[00:38:06.411 --> 00:38:07.711]  We live in a hoax world.
[00:38:08.632 --> 00:38:10.173]  Planet Hoaxville.
[00:38:13.935 --> 00:38:18.098]  You know, I shouldn't joke around about this, because everything I joke around about tends to come true.
[00:38:19.479 --> 00:38:21.240]  They may start saying the Earth's flat.
[00:38:22.237 --> 00:38:25.359]  Then Bush may get up and say it, and then people will go, it's flat now.
[00:38:25.619 --> 00:38:26.020]  Shut up!
[00:38:28.962 --> 00:38:50.136]  I mean, that's the level of just the, he's anti-gun, he's pro-open border, he's spent more money than all presidents before him combined, we're 80-something trillion in debt, and he's just running around, and there's these idiots with W stickers all over their cars, who just are in total la-la land, and you tell them, Bush is anti-gun, I was at a gun shop, and they go, no, he's not, you're a liar.
[00:38:50.822 --> 00:38:54.484]  I mean, it doesn't matter if I have Bob Barr on, NRA board member to tell you that.
[00:38:54.684 --> 00:38:55.365]  They don't listen.
[00:38:55.385 --> 00:38:56.125]  They don't care.
[00:38:56.145 --> 00:38:58.546]  They don't care about America.
[00:38:58.706 --> 00:39:05.490]  They care about loving George W. Because the idiot wears a fake cowboy hat out there at a Hollywood sound stage in Crawford.
[00:39:08.952 --> 00:39:14.035]  Never forget, Fox News even jokingly admitted about three years ago that it's a stage with little tractors and hay bales.
[00:39:14.195 --> 00:39:16.456]  They even said it's a stage.
[00:39:16.516 --> 00:39:17.217]  It's a stage.
[00:39:18.334 --> 00:39:21.595]  And I use that little example because if that's fake, everything else is.
[00:39:22.795 --> 00:39:25.795]  I mean, frankly, I look down on people that are not genuine to begin with.
[00:39:25.855 --> 00:39:26.716]  I'm not a poser.
[00:39:27.756 --> 00:39:29.176]  I don't have time to pose.
[00:39:30.136 --> 00:39:32.437]  I'm so sick of posers and all their ilk.
[00:39:32.777 --> 00:39:34.397]  Posers aren't just posing for the public.
[00:39:34.597 --> 00:39:38.318]  They're posing for themselves, their own little mental vision of themselves.
[00:39:40.058 --> 00:39:41.058]  I'm digressing here.
[00:39:41.138 --> 00:39:42.498]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:39:43.599 --> 00:39:45.519]  Everything is getting so nuts.
[00:39:48.343 --> 00:39:55.589]  It's getting crazier and crazier and crazier and crazier and crazier and crazier and crazier.
[00:40:05.477 --> 00:40:07.739]  And I know they're doing it on purpose to wear us out.
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:15.525]  That's why they'll announce they're going to attack Iran this month for sure, and they won't do it for six months a year, probably next March.
[00:40:16.585 --> 00:40:17.546]  It's like Iraq.
[00:40:17.726 --> 00:40:19.107]  Psychopaths do the same thing over and over again.
[00:40:19.628 --> 00:40:23.992]  They know that just about hearing, we're going to attack, we're going to attack.
[00:40:24.332 --> 00:40:28.575]  A lot of us at a sick level in our own subconscious psyches, we're now expecting it.
[00:40:28.615 --> 00:40:29.676]  Okay, get it over with.
[00:40:30.397 --> 00:40:33.860]  I've been here for a year hearing about this, and so I expect it to happen.
[00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:37.703]  So when it happens at a subconscious level, we're going to want it to happen.
[00:40:37.723 --> 00:40:42.287]  Because they've built up the suspense.
[00:40:42.928 --> 00:40:44.209]  They play us like a fiddle.
[00:40:45.819 --> 00:40:48.501]  You see, your conscious mind is only the surface.
[00:40:49.462 --> 00:40:52.424]  The surface of a very deep sea.
[00:40:52.444 --> 00:40:55.287]  And there's a lot of things in that sea.
[00:40:55.867 --> 00:41:00.171]  And they just sit there and manipulate both the surface and all the depths.
[00:41:00.771 --> 00:41:02.152]  And you can get control of that.
[00:41:02.192 --> 00:41:08.718]  You can figure out your brain as an electrochemical majesty designed by God.
[00:41:08.738 --> 00:41:12.061]  And you can try to control your own mind.
[00:41:12.101 --> 00:41:13.722]  You can try to get in there and see what's happening.
[00:41:15.234 --> 00:41:27.843]  And I just can't believe that you've got a public that the most high-tech, scientifically crafted brainwashing mechanisms the earth has ever seen are being used against us, and it's hard to fight it even when you know it, even when you understand their tactics.
[00:41:28.583 --> 00:41:30.504]  But the general public isn't even aware.
[00:41:30.524 --> 00:41:33.026]  They think there's some liberal spin or some conservative spin.
[00:41:33.046 --> 00:41:35.088]  See, that's another layer of the control.
[00:41:35.128 --> 00:41:44.374]  If you figure out there's a new world order, they have different layers of control, different layers of the rabbit hole in this Alice in Wonderland matrix that you break down through.
[00:41:47.225 --> 00:41:48.526]  Many different rabbit trails.
[00:41:49.907 --> 00:41:53.430]  Rat trails for you to go down.
[00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:54.571]  Little bat holes.
[00:41:54.611 --> 00:41:55.492]  Little caves.
[00:41:57.493 --> 00:41:59.335]  Little warrens for you to get stuck in.
[00:41:59.355 --> 00:42:02.197]  That's why you've got to condition yourself.
[00:42:02.217 --> 00:42:03.858]  Just deal with the facts and what you can prove.
[00:42:04.519 --> 00:42:05.359]  And that is enough.
[00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:07.021]  That's enough to drive you crazy.
[00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:14.603]  And now, Bush is passing laws that Congress didn't pass.
[00:42:14.643 --> 00:42:17.244]  He's signing laws that Congress didn't pass.
[00:42:17.284 --> 00:42:22.968]  We are reaching Captain Tengaroo level insanity.
[00:42:26.189 --> 00:42:26.910]  And I'm dumbfounded.
[00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:30.612]  I am thunderstruck.
[00:42:30.632 --> 00:42:33.634]  I feel like I've been hit by a bolt of lightning.
[00:42:33.674 --> 00:42:37.656]  I mean, it just... I'm living...
[00:42:41.266 --> 00:42:42.827]  On the dark side of the moon or something.
[00:42:44.827 --> 00:42:46.968]  And I see the mind control zombies everywhere.
[00:42:47.869 --> 00:42:51.810]  Really, the telltale sign is the pose, is what I call it.
[00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:53.271]  You see these people, these adults.
[00:42:53.291 --> 00:42:58.813]  You've got the cowboy type and the hippie type and the yuppie type and the trendy types and all the other types.
[00:42:59.353 --> 00:43:04.635]  They're all like dress-up, like little six-year-olds that dress up like pirates or dress up like...
[00:43:05.633 --> 00:43:06.274]  We're good to go.
[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:26.960]  That's posing.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.361]  When you rationalize something, you're lying to yourself.
[00:43:29.421 --> 00:43:29.921]  So much of that.
[00:43:29.941 --> 00:43:35.482]  And I just see mesmerized populations who've taken on false identities that the media hung out.
[00:43:35.502 --> 00:43:41.723]  You know, the media puts out a buffet of lies for you, and all these different selections, and all these different flavors, and all these different ideas.
[00:43:47.325 --> 00:43:48.785]  And they lay them out there for you.
[00:43:50.518 --> 00:43:59.384]  And they hope you come and select one of the identities they put out for you through television, through the sitcoms, the dramas, the theater, because we are social creatures.
[00:43:59.424 --> 00:44:00.505]  We emulate the leaders.
[00:44:00.545 --> 00:44:01.285]  We idolize.
[00:44:02.246 --> 00:44:03.827]  We fashion ourselves after someone.
[00:44:03.847 --> 00:44:07.149]  You're supposed to fashion yourself after your father, your mother, your aunt, your uncle.
[00:44:07.169 --> 00:44:12.433]  You're supposed to fashion yourself after heroes that have fought against overwhelming odds.
[00:44:13.093 --> 00:44:14.334]  That was the classical heroes.
[00:44:15.054 --> 00:44:20.218]  The old man who works his whole life to provide for his grandchildren because the parents died.
[00:44:21.403 --> 00:44:22.484]  You know, that's the heroes.
[00:44:22.504 --> 00:44:24.245]  That's what you're supposed to fashion yourself after.
[00:44:24.686 --> 00:44:33.093]  Not some gang member-ish, giggling youth in some movie with their punked-out clothes hanging down around their ankles.
[00:44:35.215 --> 00:44:46.004]  Not some punked-out population that just thinks that it's all just pick some genre that you're going to be part of and then go out there and emulate it.
[00:44:47.679 --> 00:44:49.140]  And then you're never really truly alive.
[00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:53.881]  And you talk to these people who are posing, and they just aren't even alive.
[00:44:53.901 --> 00:44:54.722]  They aren't even real.
[00:44:55.942 --> 00:44:56.882]  And I'm sick of it.
[00:45:00.684 --> 00:45:04.405]  I want people to begin by realizing that they're lying to themselves.
[00:45:06.206 --> 00:45:10.067]  And these little conservative followers of Bush, you are not conservative, number one.
[00:45:10.087 --> 00:45:11.548]  You are a disgrace to this country.
[00:45:12.228 --> 00:45:14.089]  You're a bunch of brown shirts is what you are.
[00:45:14.631 --> 00:45:17.897]  And you need to be slapped upside the head until you wake up.
[00:45:20.421 --> 00:45:23.506]  It's just like you're in your house and their house is on fire and you're about to
[00:45:24.335 --> 00:45:27.517]  And the firemen come in and say, help us get you out of here.
[00:45:27.577 --> 00:45:28.717]  Well, just carry me.
[00:45:28.737 --> 00:45:30.918]  I don't believe there's a fire.
[00:45:31.279 --> 00:45:32.539]  It's a conspiracy.
[00:45:32.939 --> 00:45:36.161]  You guys think you can just convince yourself this stuff isn't real.
[00:45:36.521 --> 00:45:38.922]  I think about it all the time, especially when I wake up in the middle of the night.
[00:45:39.363 --> 00:45:47.587]  I'll wake up at 3 a.m., I go to the bathroom or something, the bladder's about to burst, and I get up, and when my conscious mind doesn't have shields up,
[00:45:48.087 --> 00:45:51.829]  I'll be like in the bathroom, washing my hands or whatever, and I'll be standing there in the dark.
[00:45:52.209 --> 00:45:54.791]  I look at myself and I go, my God, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:45:56.112 --> 00:45:57.893]  I can't believe the path I'm on.
[00:45:57.973 --> 00:45:59.954]  I can't believe how dangerous it is.
[00:46:00.094 --> 00:46:02.475]  I can't believe that I've done this.
[00:46:02.615 --> 00:46:05.597]  I can't believe we have a government that carries out terror attacks.
[00:46:06.017 --> 00:46:08.539]  I can't believe that it's this real.
[00:46:09.799 --> 00:46:14.682]  And then I think about, man, how hard is it for the general public out there who's always in fear?
[00:46:16.223 --> 00:46:17.484]  How hard is it for them...
[00:46:19.241 --> 00:46:23.823]  When they're out there, and they deep down know the truth.
[00:46:23.863 --> 00:46:24.763]  You all know the truth.
[00:46:24.783 --> 00:46:26.404]  You knew it the day you were born.
[00:46:27.585 --> 00:46:28.805]  About the world, what happens.
[00:46:29.926 --> 00:46:30.946]  Out of the mouths of babes.
[00:46:32.006 --> 00:46:35.068]  And I just sit there, and I understand why you rationalize.
[00:46:35.288 --> 00:46:36.588]  I understand why you make excuses.
[00:46:36.648 --> 00:46:38.209]  Oh, it isn't as bad as he says.
[00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:39.530]  Oh, whatever.
[00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:42.011]  It's a lot worse than I say, okay?
[00:46:42.511 --> 00:46:45.552]  I can't articulate to you how bad it is.
[00:46:45.872 --> 00:46:47.533]  It's real bad, okay?
[00:46:48.402 --> 00:46:56.929]  They're doing stuff with genetic engineering that top scientists say is already killing the entire food chain, the biosphere, the oceans are in trouble.
[00:46:58.711 --> 00:47:02.494]  Soylent green, that chain reaction may be irreversible.
[00:47:04.349 --> 00:47:15.632]  I don't know why, but the sun is about to go 50% more bright with more energy projection than the last 11-year cycle that was the biggest on record.
[00:47:15.832 --> 00:47:19.353]  Man, we better be worried about that, not what we can do to the earth with some fossil fuels.
[00:47:19.373 --> 00:47:20.653]  See, that's all a red herring.
[00:47:20.913 --> 00:47:22.034]  See, you know something's wrong.
[00:47:22.054 --> 00:47:27.735]  See, your subconscious knows, your soul knows, your spirit knows that there's something wrong with the earth and the earth's in trouble.
[00:47:29.372 --> 00:47:30.553]  You've got a deep down fear.
[00:47:30.833 --> 00:47:32.294]  So they know you're going to be afraid.
[00:47:32.475 --> 00:47:35.397]  And so they know you're going to get entrained and do something about it.
[00:47:35.537 --> 00:47:37.158]  So they've got to give you a facsimile.
[00:47:37.198 --> 00:47:40.220]  See, that's why they have to scare you more than just get in control of you.
[00:47:40.481 --> 00:47:44.644]  They have to scare you because you'd be scared with your instincts to begin with and do something about it.
[00:47:44.804 --> 00:47:46.945]  So they have to come in with a counterfeit to make sure.
[00:47:47.126 --> 00:47:49.407]  You understand this revolutionary idea I'm giving you?
[00:47:49.487 --> 00:47:50.108]  Because it's the truth.
[00:47:50.768 --> 00:47:52.149]  And I've been realizing this more and more.
[00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:55.332]  Having these epiphanies almost on an hourly basis.
[00:47:57.145 --> 00:48:05.793]  And so they bring in the lie of, okay, it's fossil fuels, go give money to the Nature Conservancy so they can take private property, and it's a whole Rockefeller Foundation front, admittedly.
[00:48:06.994 --> 00:48:21.347]  Meanwhile, there's stuff going on with tens of thousands of tons of DEU everywhere, genetic engineering gone completely awry and completely insane, mad scientists everywhere engaged in total craziness, all sorts of problems.
[00:48:22.262 --> 00:48:24.544]  Sperm counts in the Western world down over 80%.
[00:48:24.804 --> 00:48:30.028]  Cancer going up 500% in the last 20 years, and now up 200% in the last two years alone.
[00:48:30.228 --> 00:48:31.970]  Now exponentially exploding.
[00:48:33.931 --> 00:48:35.012]  The ocean's dying.
[00:48:35.753 --> 00:48:37.975]  All sorts of weird fungus is growing everywhere.
[00:48:38.055 --> 00:48:39.176]  All kinds of problems.
[00:48:39.396 --> 00:48:40.897]  Just massive insanity!
[00:48:41.497 --> 00:48:43.699]  And are the environmentalists out there screaming about that?
[00:48:43.759 --> 00:48:45.861]  No, they want to take some poor family's farm!
[00:48:48.044 --> 00:48:51.626]  You see, you know there's something wrong with the planet, so they tell you there's something wrong with the planet.
[00:48:51.646 --> 00:48:52.707]  You go, yeah, I can feel it.
[00:48:53.667 --> 00:48:54.128]  I know it.
[00:48:54.168 --> 00:48:55.509]  I can, you know, just sense it.
[00:48:55.929 --> 00:49:00.171]  Just like mice know when a hurricane's coming days before the meteorologists do.
[00:49:00.652 --> 00:49:09.237]  Or they know hours before the storm system's even come into effect with the barometric pressure to cause a tornado in Oklahoma or Texas or Kansas.
[00:49:10.603 --> 00:49:14.024]  That's all I am is one of those little mice who picked it up a long time ago.
[00:49:14.164 --> 00:49:15.265]  I guess because I'm a good old boy.
[00:49:15.285 --> 00:49:15.845]  I'm primitive.
[00:49:16.045 --> 00:49:16.965]  I'm a caveman.
[00:49:17.205 --> 00:49:18.166]  I am what I am.
[00:49:18.406 --> 00:49:19.446]  I can see straight.
[00:49:19.646 --> 00:49:20.606]  I can see clear.
[00:49:20.827 --> 00:49:21.927]  I see what's happening.
[00:49:22.087 --> 00:49:23.287]  And we're in a world of hurt.
[00:49:23.307 --> 00:49:24.168]  Do you understand me?
[00:49:25.188 --> 00:49:26.508]  You can stop denying it.
[00:49:26.829 --> 00:49:28.089]  I don't care if it's scary.
[00:49:28.269 --> 00:49:30.230]  I don't care if it's frightening to admit the truth.
[00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:33.331]  It's better to know the truth than to go into this blind.
[00:49:36.472 --> 00:49:36.652]  See...
[00:49:37.481 --> 00:49:38.382]  Terrorism's real.
[00:49:38.422 --> 00:49:39.523]  The New World Order's real.
[00:49:39.643 --> 00:49:41.025]  And see, deep down, you're afraid.
[00:49:41.065 --> 00:49:42.286]  You know something's wrong.
[00:49:42.707 --> 00:49:44.288]  Even before 9-11, something's wrong.
[00:49:44.588 --> 00:49:45.269]  We're in trouble.
[00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:47.592]  Yeah, a great evil force has been unleashed.
[00:49:48.593 --> 00:49:49.353]  It's waxing.
[00:49:50.535 --> 00:49:53.478]  And so that evil force knows how to come in and go, yeah, there is a threat.
[00:49:53.518 --> 00:49:54.158]  You sense it.
[00:49:54.519 --> 00:49:55.460]  It's this over here.
[00:49:58.304 --> 00:50:01.267]  See, they know you're going to recognize their evil if you really look at them.
[00:50:01.287 --> 00:50:10.996]  So they shield themselves, they cloak themselves, they sequester themselves, kind of like a mist, and then they point out all their little creations or diversions or things to get you focused into that.
[00:50:13.639 --> 00:50:17.923]  But if you know where to look and you know how to study, you can learn what's happening.
[00:50:20.077 --> 00:50:28.622]  And I have come to the realization the people running this planet do come to kill, steal, and destroy, and they love death, and they are trying to kill the planet.
[00:50:29.903 --> 00:50:34.626]  There's no other conclusion that can be arrived at.
[00:50:38.168 --> 00:50:40.169]  And then you read their own documents, that's exactly what they said.
[00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:43.551]  We're only going to start with 85 to 95% of us.
[00:50:44.592 --> 00:50:49.135]  Ted Turner, Prince Philip, Henry Kissinger, World Health Organization.
[00:50:50.269 --> 00:50:51.331]  UN Population Fund.
[00:50:52.172 --> 00:50:53.954]  Carnegie, Ford, Rockefeller Foundations.
[00:50:55.055 --> 00:50:55.656]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:55.676 --> 00:51:00.121]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.563 --> 00:51:04.427]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:51:05.214 --> 00:51:05.835]  We're good to go.
[00:51:21.074 --> 00:51:26.296]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:51:26.556 --> 00:51:31.197]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:51:31.297 --> 00:51:37.538]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.578 --> 00:51:39.419]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:51:39.899 --> 00:51:41.980]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny today.
[00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:45.681]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[00:51:57.625 --> 00:51:59.706]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:52:00.606 --> 00:52:08.854]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:09.114 --> 00:52:13.478]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:13.778 --> 00:52:22.686]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:22.887 --> 00:52:26.510]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:31.839]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:32.119 --> 00:52:38.871]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:52:39.352 --> 00:52:39.892]  What about you?
[00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:41.270]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.

[00:53:50.043 --> 00:53:56.006]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:09.233]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:09.833 --> 00:54:12.775]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:13.527 --> 00:54:17.729]  I'm going to tell the government bureaucrats, the minions, the police, all of you, the military.
[00:54:18.809 --> 00:54:22.510]  You know in your guts, you know in your soul, you know in your heart, we're telling you the truth.
[00:54:22.951 --> 00:54:24.731]  Go research our facts and verify it.
[00:54:25.992 --> 00:54:29.173]  And then stand for your family, stand for your country, stand for goodness.
[00:54:29.953 --> 00:54:33.235]  Because believe me, the system that you work for right now is pure evil.
[00:54:33.535 --> 00:54:37.256]  Oh, it does a lot of good, just like rat poison's 98% good grain.
[00:54:37.796 --> 00:54:39.317]  But it's the poison mixed into it.
[00:54:40.197 --> 00:54:42.058]  It'd be like going out and getting in a new Corvette.
[00:54:42.791 --> 00:54:43.972]  Well, that's a nice Corvette.
[00:54:44.012 --> 00:54:49.334]  It's got nice big tires, nice new engine, but there's a little poison needle sticking up with cyanide.
[00:54:49.374 --> 00:54:51.154]  When you sit in the car, it's going to poison you.
[00:54:51.935 --> 00:54:54.136]  So, see, it's a setup.
[00:54:57.217 --> 00:54:57.577]  All right.
[00:54:57.617 --> 00:55:00.138]  We'll take some calls.
[00:55:00.218 --> 00:55:01.479]  Kurt in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:55:01.519 --> 00:55:02.019]  Thanks for holding.
[00:55:02.039 --> 00:55:02.459]  Go ahead.
[00:55:03.359 --> 00:55:04.000]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:07.561]  I find a lot more every day.
[00:55:07.621 --> 00:55:11.723]  When I first started out putting out your films, there were...
[00:55:12.293 --> 00:55:13.534]  It was a lot of resistance.
[00:55:13.614 --> 00:55:18.516]  I find a lot more they're wanting them than they were at first.
[00:55:19.796 --> 00:55:21.257]  People are searching for the truth.
[00:55:21.317 --> 00:55:23.518]  They know something's wrong, and they're searching for it.
[00:55:23.658 --> 00:55:28.200]  Yeah, that's because it's getting real close to stuff getting a lot worse, and their guts, their instincts are afraid.
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:29.761]  Good, that's the right response.
[00:55:30.641 --> 00:55:35.483]  Are you familiar with the book Fleshing Out Skull and Bones by Chris Milligan?
[00:55:36.043 --> 00:55:40.065]  Yeah, it's a nice little compendium of a lot of writers, and we've had him on about it.
[00:55:40.658 --> 00:55:43.440]  I got it the other day, and I couldn't put it down.
[00:55:44.321 --> 00:55:56.869]  When it talks about financial organizations, say the elite in this country financing Hitler's rise to power, financing North Vietnam to kill our troops.
[00:55:57.089 --> 00:55:59.050]  No, it's all declassified, all public now.
[00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:02.012]  And everything else, it just chills you.
[00:56:02.372 --> 00:56:06.135]  I got it one day and read nearly 300 pages of the 600 the first day.
[00:56:09.066 --> 00:56:12.527]  I think it should be reading that everybody should like to get a hold of.
[00:56:13.667 --> 00:56:17.748]  Well, it's admitted that Ho Chi Minh was given about a billion bucks on the surface.
[00:56:17.788 --> 00:56:19.969]  It was all staged while the North couldn't be attacked.
[00:56:21.149 --> 00:56:26.831]  And the Bushes, of course, and others, they were actual head Nazi agents here in the U.S., the Bush family, Prescott.
[00:56:28.011 --> 00:56:28.951]  And that's all public.
[00:56:29.331 --> 00:56:32.412]  And my film, Martial Law, spends about 45 minutes on that.
[00:56:32.812 --> 00:56:35.473]  Yes, it said in there that...
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:52.810]  In the unauthorized biography on the first Bush, that he said that anybody that was substandard, example of the eugenics program you speak of in your pictures.
[00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:54.671]  Yeah, the Bushes were big into eugenics.
[00:56:54.871 --> 00:57:03.156]  He thought that everybody that was below a certain level should be sterilized, that we were contaminating the earth by having offsprings.
[00:57:03.516 --> 00:57:04.717]  You're talking about Prescott.
[00:57:05.517 --> 00:57:05.557]  H.W.,
[00:57:07.557 --> 00:57:09.899]  George, the first Bush president.
[00:57:10.139 --> 00:57:12.762]  Matt, I didn't know about his unique experience, but I knew about the granddaddy.
[00:57:12.782 --> 00:57:13.382]  Thanks for the call.
[00:57:13.903 --> 00:57:14.724]  I appreciate it, sir.
[00:57:14.784 --> 00:57:15.344]  Great points.
[00:57:15.985 --> 00:57:17.026]  Joel, you're on the air.
[00:57:17.046 --> 00:57:17.866]  Where are you calling us from?
[00:57:17.886 --> 00:57:19.348]  Hello, Alex.
[00:57:19.468 --> 00:57:19.728]  Yes, sir.
[00:57:19.748 --> 00:57:20.489]  Where are you calling us from?
[00:57:21.009 --> 00:57:21.470]  Wisconsin.
[00:57:21.690 --> 00:57:22.030]  Welcome.
[00:57:22.511 --> 00:57:27.315]  And I just wanted to say that people are waking up, although it's kind of a deer-in-the-headlights effect.
[00:57:28.070 --> 00:57:32.452]  We had an open mic on campus, and I said I was Ari Fleischer.
[00:57:32.832 --> 00:57:37.355]  I said I didn't appreciate getting fired by the Bush administration, so ask any question you want.
[00:57:37.635 --> 00:57:38.675]  I know where the bodies are buried.
[00:57:39.396 --> 00:57:43.118]  And somebody timidly held up a hand and said, what about these weapons of mass destruction?
[00:57:43.678 --> 00:57:45.959]  I said, well, let's look at that.
[00:57:45.999 --> 00:57:54.123]  And I went through the whole spiel about first we have to have a cause to go to war, then we have to lie about the war, then we have to make you feel good about the war.
[00:57:55.101 --> 00:58:00.345]  And they didn't know what to do with freedom and expression.
[00:58:00.665 --> 00:58:04.908]  And they didn't know that they were supposed to actually ask me something and get real answers.
[00:58:05.409 --> 00:58:13.975]  But what I want to ask you about is secondhand smoke, I think, is being blamed for DU caused lung cancer.
[00:58:13.995 --> 00:58:16.376]  And I was going to get your take on that.
[00:58:16.396 --> 00:58:20.179]  Well, we have ironclad evidence.
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:22.721]  We know what's really happening.
[00:58:23.772 --> 00:58:26.654]  And I'll cover it when we get back after this quick break.
[00:58:26.674 --> 00:58:27.374]  Thank you for the call.
[00:58:27.394 --> 00:58:28.655]  Good to hear you're out there fighting, Joel.
[00:58:29.816 --> 00:58:33.698]  And we'll talk to Iben, Reuben, and others when we get back.

[00:58:45.866 --> 00:58:46.006]  Hello?
[00:58:57.004 --> 00:58:57.644]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.305 --> 00:58:59.365]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.085 --> 00:59:01.186]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:01.826 --> 00:59:02.646]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.407 --> 00:59:04.387]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.968 --> 00:59:08.669]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.149 --> 00:59:13.291]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:19.034 --> 00:59:20.675]  Now into the second hour.
[00:59:22.071 --> 00:59:23.812]  We have a talk show host from D.C.
[00:59:23.873 --> 00:59:26.515]  who was fired when he criticized Israel.
[00:59:28.476 --> 00:59:30.318]  Where's the freedom going in this country?
[00:59:32.359 --> 00:59:33.700]  And we're about to go back to your calls.
[00:59:34.281 --> 00:59:39.705]  Joel in Wisconsin had to talk about, yeah, lung cancer is up six-fold in the last three years.
[00:59:40.646 --> 00:59:41.547]  I mean, everybody's getting it.
[00:59:41.627 --> 00:59:42.608]  People who never smoked.
[00:59:43.008 --> 00:59:44.049]  Little kids are getting it.
[00:59:44.089 --> 00:59:44.889]  Women are getting it.
[00:59:45.370 --> 00:59:47.331]  Christopher Reeves' 45-year-old wife got it.
[00:59:47.371 --> 00:59:48.052]  She never smoked.
[00:59:49.173 --> 00:59:50.534]  D.U., I mean, you get this to him.
[00:59:51.584 --> 00:59:56.865]  A few thousand of these little particles, which there's just billions blowing around in a square mile.
[00:59:57.405 --> 00:59:58.445]  It's all over the planet now.
[00:59:58.865 --> 01:00:01.466]  Hundreds of thousands of tons have been used all over the globe.
[01:00:01.786 --> 01:00:03.406]  Ten proving grounds here in the U.S.
[01:00:03.446 --> 01:00:04.146]  It's up everywhere.
[01:00:04.186 --> 01:00:05.306]  Detectors are picking it up.
[01:00:05.526 --> 01:00:06.867]  They're finding these people's lungs.
[01:00:07.307 --> 01:00:10.227]  We're all breathing it right now, so enjoy it.
[01:00:10.507 --> 01:00:13.928]  Thanks to New World Order psychopaths for all you do, you nuts.
[01:00:14.008 --> 01:00:15.148]  We know it's only the beginning.
[01:00:15.208 --> 01:00:15.668]  Thank you.
[01:00:16.648 --> 01:00:19.889]  But, yeah, they're now claiming it's secondhand smoke.
[01:00:20.552 --> 01:00:24.015]  Big national statistics just came out from the CDC.
[01:00:26.016 --> 01:00:29.358]  Smoking is at all-time lows in U.S.
[01:00:29.378 --> 01:00:29.979]  history, period.
[01:00:30.599 --> 01:00:32.160]  There are now less smokers than ever.
[01:00:33.641 --> 01:00:35.903]  And that trend has been going for now 20 years.
[01:00:37.484 --> 01:00:40.166]  And we're now seeing massive increases in people that have never even had it.
[01:00:40.867 --> 01:00:43.869]  So how have you had more smoking in the past, and all the smoking indoors...
[01:00:44.614 --> 01:00:52.877]  Would there now suddenly, with all these cities banning secondhand smoke and the rest of it in restaurants and buildings, would it suddenly, with no evidence, would they be saying secondhand smoke is causing it?
[01:00:53.157 --> 01:00:53.837]  You've got to love it.
[01:00:53.857 --> 01:01:02.099]  I mean, now everybody's going to get lung cancer, basically, and they'll all have DU in their lungs, and they'll go, no, it was those cigarettes.
[01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:04.380]  One whiff and you're dead.
[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:08.121]  But uranium, that's nutritious.
[01:01:08.801 --> 01:01:10.042]  And mercury is good, too.
[01:01:11.742 --> 01:01:14.083]  They'll probably have newscasts saying DU is nutritious pretty soon.
[01:01:14.682 --> 01:01:15.623]  Put it on your Wheaties.
[01:01:15.663 --> 01:01:16.823]  DU Fortified.
[01:01:16.844 --> 01:01:17.944]  A new mineral.
[01:01:17.964 --> 01:01:23.968]  I mean, they've got a newscast saying mercury's nutritious and good for your brain, so that's what's going on.
[01:01:25.189 --> 01:01:27.811]  Let's go ahead and go to Ivan in Oklahoma.
[01:01:27.991 --> 01:01:28.311]  Welcome.
[01:01:29.732 --> 01:01:31.233]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:01:32.114 --> 01:01:36.116]  I just want to first thank you for the red, white, and blue film that you had put out.
[01:01:36.336 --> 01:01:39.979]  I had just finished watching all three of those the other day.
[01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:45.964]  And to be quite frank with you, I cried afterwards because I realized just how bad it is.
[01:01:46.985 --> 01:01:49.247]  And so right now I'm letting my friends view this.
[01:01:50.247 --> 01:01:55.812]  And for those who don't know, the Red, White, and Blue special is three DVD specials together.
[01:01:56.232 --> 01:02:00.876]  Loose Change, and of course, Marshall, Law, and Road to Tyranny.
[01:02:01.776 --> 01:02:02.417]  Right, right.
[01:02:03.237 --> 01:02:04.018]  My question is,
[01:02:04.927 --> 01:02:06.948]  Alex, do you think they do this out of ignorance?
[01:02:07.028 --> 01:02:08.129]  Well, I know why.
[01:02:32.995 --> 01:02:35.797]  They will lose their licenses if they don't tow the line.
[01:02:36.778 --> 01:02:39.940]  Their FCC and cable licenses and satellite licenses that are issued.
[01:02:40.821 --> 01:02:48.106]  And the government will come up with their 501c3 license they get from the government.
[01:02:48.126 --> 01:02:53.630]  And they've been promised billions and billions of dollars in faith-based initiative if they go along.
[01:02:53.650 --> 01:02:56.091]  They're going to be getting big cash money from the government.
[01:02:56.131 --> 01:02:57.713]  So there's your main reasons.
[01:02:58.493 --> 01:03:00.955]  Okay, so they fear man more than they fear God.
[01:03:02.648 --> 01:03:08.731]  Well, I mean, a lot of them are high-level masons and Satanists or drug dealers using it for a drug-dealing front.
[01:03:09.171 --> 01:03:11.272]  I mean, just most of them are charlatans, sir.
[01:03:12.352 --> 01:03:12.752]  Okay.
[01:03:12.952 --> 01:03:15.834]  Well, Alex, thank you very much, and keep up the good work.
[01:03:16.054 --> 01:03:16.334]  All right.
[01:03:16.394 --> 01:03:17.394]  I appreciate your call.
[01:03:18.335 --> 01:03:19.435]  And I'm sorry I have to tell you that.
[01:03:19.455 --> 01:03:26.098]  I mean, there are a few good shows, I guess, on TBN, a few of those things, but... I mean, I'm not joking.
[01:03:27.538 --> 01:03:28.419]  A lot of these big...
[01:03:30.592 --> 01:03:32.434]  International foundations for kids and stuff.
[01:03:32.454 --> 01:03:37.239]  They're really just government fronts involved in white slavery, drug dealing, you name it.
[01:03:39.601 --> 01:03:41.042]  We've got articles on that.
[01:03:41.963 --> 01:03:45.206]  See, if you're a criminal, posing as a preacher is a real good way to do it, isn't it?
[01:03:46.307 --> 01:03:47.048]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:47.789 --> 01:03:48.269]  Stay with us.
[01:03:52.958 --> 01:03:55.840]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:59.081]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?

[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:56.441]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:04:56.681 --> 01:04:58.262]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:04:58.602 --> 01:05:03.284]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:05:03.624 --> 01:05:10.346]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:05:10.666 --> 01:05:12.648]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:05:12.868 --> 01:05:15.691]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:05:15.791 --> 01:05:20.475]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:05:20.675 --> 01:05:25.079]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:05:25.319 --> 01:05:32.546]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:05:32.786 --> 01:05:35.208]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[01:05:52.708 --> 01:05:54.389]  What causes foods to spoil?
[01:05:54.809 --> 01:05:57.790]  All produce produces a natural gas which causes ripening.
[01:05:58.110 --> 01:06:03.412]  In addition, foods like onions and garlic emit odors, causing foods to lose their freshness and flavor.
[01:06:03.712 --> 01:06:13.255]  Now there's Forever Fresh for the fridge, a revolutionary new product proven to eliminate refrigerator odors and guaranteed to keep produce fresh at least twice as long as normal.
[01:06:13.515 --> 01:06:15.716]  Nancy McKimson of Jacksonville, Florida says...
[01:06:15.996 --> 01:06:19.559]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, everything stays fresh much longer.
[01:06:19.819 --> 01:06:23.042]  Like strawberries, which now last a couple of weeks instead of just a few days.
[01:06:23.322 --> 01:06:26.865]  Jane Burke of New Jersey says... You know, we eat a lot of salads.
[01:06:27.025 --> 01:06:30.488]  I used to throw out the leftovers because they'd turn brown and they'd shrivel up.
[01:06:30.628 --> 01:06:31.890]  I'm really amazed.
[01:06:32.050 --> 01:06:37.895]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, all my produce stays fresher longer, including the leftovers.
[01:06:38.035 --> 01:06:40.457]  Now I just couldn't get along without Forever Fresh.
[01:06:40.797 --> 01:06:48.925]  To order your Forever Fresh for the fridge, visit the web at foreverfresh.us or call toll-free 1-866-NO-ODERS.

[01:06:53.830 --> 01:06:59.856]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:00.477 --> 01:07:03.440]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.203 --> 01:07:16.805]  Open phones throughout the next two hours that we've got left in this worldwide broadcast, or one hour, 51 minutes to be precise.
[01:07:17.605 --> 01:07:19.605]  Toll free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:07:19.645 --> 01:07:24.606]  I know what you call a Bible thumper.
[01:07:24.627 --> 01:07:25.667]  I'm not really a Pharisee.
[01:07:25.707 --> 01:07:30.388]  I don't get around telling everybody about the beams in their own eye, because I've got plenty of beams of my own.
[01:07:31.088 --> 01:07:33.009]  But I do love God, and I'm a Christian.
[01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:33.649]  I don't hide that.
[01:07:33.669 --> 01:07:34.809]  But this is a news program.
[01:07:35.552 --> 01:07:46.140]  But all over the country we have had Christians being arrested for their speech, arrested for protesting, arrested for demonstrating, not even outside abortion clinics, but just out on the streets of major American cities.
[01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:56.168]  And we've had liberals getting arrested with a t-shirt saying, I'm against the war, and there's 500 unpermitted pro-Bush people, but the demonstrator that's anti-Bush goes to jail.
[01:07:57.705 --> 01:08:00.287]  And I've experienced my own personal type of censorship.
[01:08:00.307 --> 01:08:07.091]  I mean, I had the highest ratings of not just the talk stations in Central Texas, but I was dwarfing almost all the music stations.
[01:08:07.111 --> 01:08:09.473]  I think there were like one or two that had higher ratings.
[01:08:09.493 --> 01:08:15.477]  It was ridiculous, ten shares and things of that nature, and time spent listening of 45 minutes.
[01:08:16.057 --> 01:08:20.420]  And, you know, that's back in the late 1990s here locally on an affiliate that's now Spanish Music.
[01:08:22.801 --> 01:08:25.083]  98.9, The Invasion or whatever it's called.
[01:08:25.623 --> 01:08:26.504]  Oh, that's the other station.
[01:08:28.578 --> 01:08:36.800]  And they got a new program director, or new general manager, excuse me, and they said, hey, Jay Leno talked about you two nights ago.
[01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:41.642]  And the vice president of the company was on a bunch of newspapers and radio stations.
[01:08:41.682 --> 01:08:43.222]  Shamrock Communications flew down.
[01:08:43.982 --> 01:08:45.683]  And he said, you're going to shut up about all this stuff.
[01:08:45.703 --> 01:08:46.843]  You're going to shut up about Bill Clinton.
[01:08:46.863 --> 01:08:47.983]  You're going to shut up about Waco.
[01:08:48.003 --> 01:08:49.964]  You're going to shut up about George Bush.
[01:08:49.984 --> 01:08:50.824]  You're going to shut up.
[01:08:51.809 --> 01:08:54.211]  And I said, well, I mean, I've got a lot of sponsors for you.
[01:08:54.231 --> 01:08:56.012]  You're paying me almost nothing, but you make a lot of money.
[01:08:56.052 --> 01:08:58.193]  And I thought it's first limit at its best.
[01:08:58.293 --> 01:08:59.634]  And then they changed the motto.
[01:08:59.654 --> 01:09:02.296]  It was no longer 98.9, first limit at its best.
[01:09:02.776 --> 01:09:04.397]  It was just, you know, talk radio.
[01:09:06.218 --> 01:09:07.139]  They got a new tagline.
[01:09:07.159 --> 01:09:09.901]  And then for six weeks or so, I wouldn't shut up.
[01:09:09.921 --> 01:09:10.481]  They called me again.
[01:09:10.501 --> 01:09:11.842]  They said, we're going to fire you if you don't shut up.
[01:09:11.962 --> 01:09:13.663]  And a few weeks later, they did fire me.
[01:09:14.404 --> 01:09:14.924]  And I didn't care.
[01:09:14.944 --> 01:09:16.145]  I'd already started my show.
[01:09:17.558 --> 01:09:20.261]  On the then-fledgling Genesis.
[01:09:20.301 --> 01:09:22.402]  In fact, I'd already been doing two shows at once.
[01:09:23.824 --> 01:09:33.232]  Doing a show from my home for an hour a day, and then an hour at night doing two a day, and then coming back at night, driving up to the studio in Austin and doing it.
[01:09:35.053 --> 01:09:41.479]  And they called me in with such pleasure and said, Get your stuff and get out of here!
[01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:44.221]  You thought you could talk about my Marines?
[01:09:44.341 --> 01:09:45.142]  You're fired!
[01:09:45.808 --> 01:09:51.370]  That was because I went and videotaped Marines training with hundreds of role players screaming, I'm an American.
[01:09:51.450 --> 01:09:52.810]  No, no, not the camp.
[01:09:53.190 --> 01:09:55.391]  And fake interrogations were, where'd you get the guns?
[01:09:55.431 --> 01:09:55.851]  Where do you live?
[01:09:55.891 --> 01:09:56.771]  I live in San Francisco.
[01:09:57.191 --> 01:09:58.832]  I mean, openly trying to take our guns.
[01:09:58.932 --> 01:10:03.553]  So I'd get on air and go, I was what you'd call more mainline conservative.
[01:10:03.853 --> 01:10:04.653]  Now, I haven't changed.
[01:10:04.693 --> 01:10:05.894]  The conservatives have.
[01:10:05.914 --> 01:10:11.155]  But, you know, control the borders, pro-gun, get rid of the Federal Reserve, interviewing Ron Paul.
[01:10:11.635 --> 01:10:13.296]  I mean, it was pretty milquetoast back then.
[01:10:14.264 --> 01:10:15.905]  I didn't know a hundredth of what I know now.
[01:10:17.626 --> 01:10:21.549]  And I just came back and said, I went to the Civil Warfare drill, and it's what I'd heard.
[01:10:21.589 --> 01:10:22.690]  They're training for America.
[01:10:23.290 --> 01:10:27.233]  And I go, our great Marines shouldn't be having this happen to them.
[01:10:27.313 --> 01:10:28.334]  I was very reverential.
[01:10:28.814 --> 01:10:30.215]  That still wasn't good enough.
[01:10:30.255 --> 01:10:31.956]  You know, I'm a former Marine Corps captain.
[01:10:32.137 --> 01:10:33.077]  You're fired!
[01:10:33.758 --> 01:10:34.318]  Well, you know what?
[01:10:34.358 --> 01:10:36.279]  You're an out-of-work loser now, buddy.
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:38.241]  God punished you.
[01:10:39.156 --> 01:10:44.705]  And everybody that worked there who was against me, who thought it was funny and snickered and laughed, are a bunch of losers.
[01:10:45.025 --> 01:10:48.631]  And I predict that our guest that we've got on...
[01:10:49.986 --> 01:10:53.828]  With us right now is going to be blessed after he's been punished for free speech.
[01:10:53.868 --> 01:10:55.169]  And I don't attack Israel.
[01:10:55.189 --> 01:11:05.596]  You know, I get criticized for not even being neutral on it, but just saying, you know, that, well, I mean, Israel could have a state if it wasn't so anti-Christian and anti-Muslim and anti-Jew.
[01:11:05.616 --> 01:11:07.197]  I mean, it's atheists.
[01:11:07.237 --> 01:11:08.878]  The Labor Zionist funded Hitler.
[01:11:09.238 --> 01:11:09.998]  That's now public.
[01:11:11.399 --> 01:11:13.461]  So I get criticized for not bashing Israel.
[01:11:13.521 --> 01:11:18.864]  But Christian radio host fired for criticizing Israel, 20-year host, Dale Crowley, with high ratings.
[01:11:19.804 --> 01:11:20.945]  Told you can't talk about that.
[01:11:21.405 --> 01:11:23.407]  Michael Collins Piper, American Free Press.
[01:11:23.447 --> 01:11:29.971]  The un-American thought police operating on American soil have struck once again this time.
[01:11:30.031 --> 01:11:41.240]  Their victim is veteran Christian evangelist Dale Crowley Jr., who has been the host of two popular radio programs broadcast on WFAX, 1220 AM radio in Washington area for 20 years.
[01:11:42.609 --> 01:11:46.430]  And they were told, you're fired, you can't talk like that in the Israeli lobby.
[01:11:46.730 --> 01:11:48.951]  Your focus on Israel is not allowed.
[01:11:49.311 --> 01:11:50.011]  And what does he do?
[01:11:50.631 --> 01:11:56.292]  He just gets up there, kind of like the whole Jews for Jesus thing, and says, we need to get Jews to become Christian.
[01:11:56.652 --> 01:11:59.073]  We need to have them not ban proselytizing.
[01:11:59.453 --> 01:12:03.514]  Did you know they catch you pulling out a tract and handing a tract?
[01:12:04.714 --> 01:12:07.295]  Just a mainline tract.
[01:12:07.355 --> 01:12:09.235]  It doesn't matter if it's Catholic, Protestant, whatever.
[01:12:09.536 --> 01:12:10.516]  You are arrested.
[01:12:10.556 --> 01:12:11.476]  You are deported.
[01:12:12.327 --> 01:12:14.528]  There is no freedom of religion in Israel.
[01:12:14.728 --> 01:12:15.869]  They don't have a free press.
[01:12:15.909 --> 01:12:16.949]  They're not a free country.
[01:12:17.610 --> 01:12:18.750]  They have staged elections.
[01:12:19.751 --> 01:12:21.732]  And we need to be able to talk about this.
[01:12:21.792 --> 01:12:31.056]  But regardless, to take an established staple show and fire the host... Now, hey, they own the station.
[01:12:31.076 --> 01:12:31.616]  They can do it.
[01:12:31.716 --> 01:12:33.117]  But we can criticize them for it.
[01:12:33.617 --> 01:12:36.939]  So I wouldn't even so much call this censorship as it is political correctness.
[01:12:38.234 --> 01:12:39.295]  People confuse censorship.
[01:12:39.315 --> 01:12:44.738]  Censorship is if they don't let Mr. Crowley go out and start a newspaper or start his own radio show or go get a show.
[01:12:44.758 --> 01:12:48.160]  If the government comes in and says, you can't have Mr. Crowley on, then that is censorship.
[01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:49.741]  And in a way, I get the idea that happens.
[01:12:49.761 --> 01:12:51.682]  So maybe it is classical censorship.
[01:12:52.083 --> 01:12:55.144]  Mr. Crowley, thanks for sitting through my four-minute diatribe.
[01:12:55.164 --> 01:12:56.045]  Good to have you on with us.
[01:12:56.545 --> 01:13:01.227]  Nice listening to you, Alex, and thank you for the invitation to be on your program.
[01:13:01.507 --> 01:13:01.747]  Good.
[01:13:02.067 --> 01:13:03.087]  No, no, thank you for coming on.
[01:13:03.147 --> 01:13:06.409]  Tell us what happened to you in your little run-in with the police.
[01:13:06.429 --> 01:13:12.791]  Tell us about yourself and give us an example of what Mr. Crowley talks about on his radio show.
[01:13:13.351 --> 01:13:16.712]  Just give us a sample of this evilness that was supposedly being broadcast.
[01:13:17.293 --> 01:13:20.594]  Well, Alex, I'm a very soft-spoken person.
[01:13:20.654 --> 01:13:21.834]  I'm slow of speech.
[01:13:21.854 --> 01:13:23.515]  I don't have the gift that you have.
[01:13:24.218 --> 01:13:25.739]  So you're going to have to bear with me.
[01:13:26.059 --> 01:13:27.780]  I'm a paleo-conservative.
[01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:28.660]  I go way back.
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:37.024]  My father was a militant Baptist preacher beginning in the 1920s, going through the 30s and 40s.
[01:13:37.044 --> 01:13:40.166]  And I'm following in his example.
[01:13:40.786 --> 01:13:42.127]  He was a patriot.
[01:13:42.167 --> 01:13:44.007]  He was an America First patriot.
[01:13:44.668 --> 01:13:48.029]  He opposed the Vietnam War because it was not declared.
[01:13:48.910 --> 01:13:53.512]  And he knew the whole story on Israel, although he didn't say too much about it.
[01:13:54.102 --> 01:13:55.383]  In his radio ministry.
[01:13:56.083 --> 01:13:59.765]  He began his radio ministry here in the Washington area in 1941.
[01:14:00.486 --> 01:14:08.550]  I was on his program many times in the 1940s, in the 1950s from Japan, on this very radio station.
[01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:14.534]  And let me begin at the very outset, Alex, by saying that this that happened is tragic.
[01:14:15.514 --> 01:14:21.237]  We have been friends, our family and the Newcombs have been close friends for 53 years.
[01:14:22.941 --> 01:14:23.161]  Since 1953.
[01:14:23.741 --> 01:14:28.782]  So this wasn't any light thing.
[01:14:28.822 --> 01:14:29.762]  I mean, I've researched this.
[01:14:29.782 --> 01:14:33.483]  You guys are icons, you and your father, in the area, staples.
[01:14:33.863 --> 01:14:36.923]  And so this is like chopping an arm off at the radio station.
[01:14:36.943 --> 01:14:39.264]  That shows the incredible power of the AIPAC lobby.
[01:14:39.504 --> 01:14:42.404]  Well, that's why I want to lay this foundation.
[01:14:42.704 --> 01:14:46.365]  We had this close relationship, and it's been disrupted.
[01:14:47.065 --> 01:14:51.146]  I broadcast 1,000 broadcasts of the Focus on Israel since 1986.
[01:14:52.879 --> 01:15:07.804]  Only once a week, 15 or 20 minutes every Saturday morning, and suddenly, the program hasn't changed, I haven't changed, but suddenly, two weeks ago, I was informed that the program was being discontinued.
[01:15:08.444 --> 01:15:10.765]  Now, gagged is a better word than fired.
[01:15:10.825 --> 01:15:12.026]  They don't employ me.
[01:15:12.906 --> 01:15:14.006]  I'm self-employed.
[01:15:14.646 --> 01:15:19.228]  I'm an ordained Baptist minister, and this was basically a Bible study program.
[01:15:20.097 --> 01:15:23.320]  Israel is mentioned in the Bible 2,500 times.
[01:15:24.021 --> 01:15:29.086]  The Jews are mentioned 100 times in the Old Testament, 200 times in the New Testament.
[01:15:29.887 --> 01:15:32.630]  And I told the owner, Doris Newcomb,
[01:15:33.886 --> 01:15:39.828]  I'm not going to be able to teach the Bible anymore if I'm not permitted to use the words Israel and Jews.
[01:15:40.108 --> 01:15:41.489]  Oh, they specifically told you that?
[01:15:41.969 --> 01:15:42.709]  Specifically.
[01:15:42.769 --> 01:15:46.770]  You cannot use the words Israel and Jews on your radio program anymore.
[01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:49.811]  So now just don't even use words in the Bible.
[01:15:49.871 --> 01:15:50.392]  Unbelievable.
[01:15:51.932 --> 01:15:53.113]  That's tragic.
[01:15:53.213 --> 01:15:57.934]  And our friendship, this 53-year friendship we've had since 1953, has been disrupted.
[01:16:01.161 --> 01:16:16.458]  And so the only conclusion you can come to is something powerful and ominous and frightening and terrifying had to happen to cause the station, the Newcombs, to make this decision.
[01:16:17.019 --> 01:16:21.304]  It probably has the biggest audience on Saturday morning of any program.
[01:16:21.852 --> 01:16:22.914]  In the Washington area.
[01:16:23.094 --> 01:16:24.256]  And now they've lost it.
[01:16:24.596 --> 01:16:26.560]  Yeah, with radio, everything is time.
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:28.783]  It's always being there and having a decent program.
[01:16:29.023 --> 01:16:32.369]  But if you've got something that's decent and it's there continually, that's what builds audience.
[01:16:33.330 --> 01:16:35.053]  But like nothing else...
[01:16:36.141 --> 01:16:42.843]  But specifically, Mr. Crowley, something really, really scary must have happened for this to develop.
[01:16:43.443 --> 01:16:48.345]  This network tried leasing stations a few years ago, just a few tests to see how it would work.
[01:16:48.765 --> 01:16:54.566]  We leased one in D.C., and the owner flat out said he was getting complaints from the Senate.
[01:16:55.247 --> 01:17:01.008]  Senators were calling, saying, get that off, and they basically came back and tried to buy us back out.
[01:17:01.308 --> 01:17:03.469]  I mean, that's how scared they are of things like this.
[01:17:04.156 --> 01:17:09.921]  Well, that could have been one of the... I don't know what triggered this decision.
[01:17:10.742 --> 01:17:13.225]  It could have been the White House, Homeland Security.
[01:17:13.285 --> 01:17:19.670]  I've been opposed to this Israel's war against Iraq for over three years now, before it began.
[01:17:19.690 --> 01:17:28.198]  The Federal Communications Commission might have been pressured to...
[01:17:29.471 --> 01:17:33.672]  To talk about anti-Semitism and hate speech, which the program is not.
[01:17:33.773 --> 01:17:35.113]  I'm not a hateful person.
[01:17:35.993 --> 01:17:39.454]  I've broadcast 1,000 broadcasts of the Focus on Israel.
[01:17:39.835 --> 01:17:41.495]  It's a Bible study program.
[01:17:42.055 --> 01:17:44.956]  I close every broadcast with Romans 10.1.
[01:17:45.597 --> 01:17:49.618]  My heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that Israel will be saved.
[01:17:51.879 --> 01:17:55.420]  And the AIPAC people have got it banned in Israel to say that.
[01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:57.001]  We want Jews to come to Jesus.
[01:17:57.321 --> 01:18:00.402]  And so now, buddy, you can't say it in Washington.
[01:18:01.142 --> 01:18:03.683]  Pretty soon it will be greater Israel here.
[01:18:04.263 --> 01:18:06.204]  Well, that's exactly right.
[01:18:06.444 --> 01:18:10.705]  I've been coasting along here for 20 years.
[01:18:11.105 --> 01:18:12.466]  I thought I was untouchable.
[01:18:12.706 --> 01:18:13.026]  I didn't.
[01:18:13.806 --> 01:18:19.531]  I thought if they left me alone for 20 years telling the truth on the subject... You're a canary in the coal mine, buddy.
[01:18:19.571 --> 01:18:21.013]  We're in the 11th hour, Pastor.
[01:18:21.293 --> 01:18:22.414]  Well, I know that.
[01:18:22.434 --> 01:18:23.034]  I know that.
[01:18:23.115 --> 01:18:27.919]  But to go along 20 years, it reassures you that you're okay.
[01:18:28.639 --> 01:18:35.586]  But then suddenly, I'm out, so... I want to hear what they specifically said to you, Mr. Crowley, when we get back.
[01:18:36.386 --> 01:18:38.809]  We're going to return after just a few short messages.
[01:18:38.829 --> 01:18:40.150]  Very important, so stay with us.
[01:18:41.113 --> 01:18:43.977]  And did a show for 20 years as a father, I guess for 50-something.
[01:18:44.397 --> 01:18:47.141]  And that's 1220 AM radio in the D.C.
[01:18:47.301 --> 01:18:47.601]  area.
[01:18:48.062 --> 01:18:49.383]  Not allowed to say the word Israel.
[01:18:52.586 --> 01:18:56.047]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:18:56.327 --> 01:18:59.829]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:18:59.909 --> 01:19:03.850]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:19:04.090 --> 01:19:10.232]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:19:10.652 --> 01:19:18.555]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:19:18.975 --> 01:19:24.319]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:19:24.479 --> 01:19:28.241]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:19:28.601 --> 01:19:30.463]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:19:30.523 --> 01:19:32.664]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:19:32.924 --> 01:19:37.867]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[01:19:37.907 --> 01:19:43.471]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:19:46.633 --> 01:19:48.179]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[01:19:52.768 --> 01:19:55.009]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[01:19:55.429 --> 01:19:59.792]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[01:20:00.072 --> 01:20:05.875]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[01:20:06.095 --> 01:20:10.177]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[01:20:10.437 --> 01:20:16.080]  However, they have become the elite group more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:18.821]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[01:20:20.902 --> 01:20:21.182]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.

[01:22:32.978 --> 01:22:34.760]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:36.441]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:17.456 --> 01:23:18.597]  Welcome back, my friends.
[01:23:19.397 --> 01:23:23.300]  Veteran Christian evangelist Dale Crowley, Jr.
[01:23:24.461 --> 01:23:28.303]  Family on the station for over 50 years, and now this happens.
[01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:30.901]  Why did this happen?
[01:23:30.921 --> 01:23:32.502]  Did you get a phone call?
[01:23:32.522 --> 01:23:33.403]  Did they call you in?
[01:23:33.483 --> 01:23:34.443]  What developed?
[01:23:35.384 --> 01:23:36.144]  What did they tell you?
[01:23:37.105 --> 01:23:40.327]  Well, I have a live program on Friday and Saturday.
[01:23:40.507 --> 01:23:46.931]  After the Friday live program, morning of March 3rd, I was called into the office of the owner.
[01:23:47.912 --> 01:23:49.993]  My wife and I sat there.
[01:23:50.854 --> 01:23:55.837]  And she told us what the decision had been.
[01:23:58.961 --> 01:24:00.322]  It was a tense moment.
[01:24:00.382 --> 01:24:01.903]  She was not comfortable at all.
[01:24:02.783 --> 01:24:08.767]  But she told me seven or eight things here that I could and could not do.
[01:24:10.187 --> 01:24:16.411]  And to understand the impact of this, you have to understand the content of the program.
[01:24:17.051 --> 01:24:21.373]  About one-fourth of the program once a week was the Bible, Bible lessons.
[01:24:22.194 --> 01:24:27.237]  Then I quoted from Jewish writings frequently, the Talmud and Kol Nidri and things like that.
[01:24:28.777 --> 01:24:31.759]  I've known a lot of Jews, and I've quoted them.
[01:24:31.859 --> 01:24:38.862]  Jacob Gartenhaus, Haviv Schieber, Al Lilienthal, Rabbi Elmer Berger, and Arthur Kessler.
[01:24:38.902 --> 01:24:43.204]  I didn't know him, but I quoted from his book, The Thirteenth Tribe, frequently.
[01:24:44.025 --> 01:24:56.371]  And then one of the features of the broadcast, once a week, was the two leading Jewish newspapers in the country, Forward out of New York and Washington Jewish Week out of Rockville, Maryland.
[01:24:57.252 --> 01:24:57.652]  And then...
[01:24:59.359 --> 01:25:05.601]  A small part of the program was my own comments, interpretations, and opinions.
[01:25:06.161 --> 01:25:14.383]  In other words, the sources were completely, if you want to use the word, Jewish or religious or biblical.
[01:25:14.623 --> 01:25:20.585]  I refrained from introducing too many of my own ideas and thoughts.
[01:25:21.165 --> 01:25:24.786]  It was a Bible study and a news program, basically.
[01:25:25.546 --> 01:25:27.307]  He told me that in 1986, Habib Schieber.
[01:25:55.583 --> 01:25:59.064]  Many of your listeners have heard the name and know who he is.
[01:25:59.104 --> 01:26:00.524]  You can find him on the Internet.
[01:26:01.965 --> 01:26:09.607]  A dear Christian Jewish friend of mine, and he helped me start this program in 1986, and said, don't be afraid.
[01:26:10.587 --> 01:26:15.808]  And he said, the phoniest accusation that they will bring against you is anti-Semitic.
[01:26:16.568 --> 01:26:22.690]  He said, remember, there are 200 million Arab Semites in the world and only about 20 million of us Jewish Semites.
[01:26:23.685 --> 01:26:30.168]  And he said, therefore, anti-Semitism is a phony accusation to bring against anybody.
[01:26:30.869 --> 01:26:32.989]  So I haven't been afraid, Alex.
[01:26:33.310 --> 01:26:35.030]  And I've been sincere.
[01:26:35.090 --> 01:26:36.111]  I've been forthcoming.
[01:26:36.171 --> 01:26:39.252]  I think this is knowledge that Christians ought to have.
[01:26:40.253 --> 01:26:44.795]  And I believe that it has been obscured by these pro-Israel people.
[01:26:48.334 --> 01:27:02.298]  Well, Mr. Crowley, Pastor Crowley, I know a lot of Jewish, you know, Baptist preachers and others who happen to be Jewish, and they'll tell you the Talmud and the Zohar and all that stuff that came out of Babylon later is completely anti-Torah and anti-Jewish.
[01:27:02.778 --> 01:27:13.302]  So I don't, and I guess that's what you covered, was just the stuff about how everybody else is slaves and deserve to die and, you know, all this other really crazy stuff that comes out of there.
[01:27:13.522 --> 01:27:13.742]  Yes.
[01:27:14.342 --> 01:27:23.072]  Well, I pointed that out, and I relied a lot on my friend in Missouri, Herm Otten, who publishes the Christian News.
[01:27:23.512 --> 01:27:24.693]  Well, I mean, here's my analogy.
[01:27:24.733 --> 01:27:26.735]  Let's say you and I are paleo-conservative.
[01:27:26.755 --> 01:27:30.599]  We support the Founding Fathers and the Declaration of Independence, Constitution, Bill of Rights.
[01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:34.323]  And then Bush comes along and says, no, that's no longer American.
[01:27:34.644 --> 01:27:36.526]  What I'm doing with the police state and...
[01:27:37.828 --> 01:27:38.328]  We're good to go.
[01:28:08.168 --> 01:28:09.390]  Well, that's exactly right.
[01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:11.131]  And Jesus got in trouble.
[01:28:11.171 --> 01:28:23.523]  My Habib Sheber said to me many times, if Jesus had dealt with the Jews of his day like Jerry Falwell deals with the Jews today, he never would have been crucified.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.263]  So we're right where we were in New Testament times, Alex.
[01:28:29.363 --> 01:28:30.624]  Well, that's what it's all about.
[01:28:30.684 --> 01:28:36.508]  It's about a bunch of Satanists in control, and Jesus trying to overturn it, and it's the same thing today.
[01:28:36.528 --> 01:28:37.629]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:37.649 --> 01:28:38.049]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.052 --> 01:28:43.973]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.433 --> 01:28:46.034]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.955 --> 01:28:49.657]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.476 --> 01:28:56.479]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:28:56.820 --> 01:29:05.649]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:29:05.969 --> 01:29:10.654]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:29:11.114 --> 01:29:17.837]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:29:18.217 --> 01:29:30.022]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:29:30.482 --> 01:29:34.945]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[01:29:52.992 --> 01:29:53.593]  We're good to go.
[01:30:13.493 --> 01:30:14.554]  So take matters into your own hands.
[01:30:30.063 --> 01:30:34.068]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[01:30:34.308 --> 01:30:36.150]  Dango is what you are looking for.

[01:32:01.969 --> 01:32:02.990]  Welcome back.
[01:32:03.190 --> 01:32:06.553]  It's March 16, 2006 on this Thursday live edition.
[01:32:06.573 --> 01:32:14.038]  A few days ago when I saw this article, I went and did a Google search for audio for Pastor Dale Crowley.
[01:32:14.839 --> 01:32:16.580]  And again, it's pretty tame stuff.
[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:23.305]  I mean, it's just the classic, we need to bring Jews to Jesus and Israel's, you know, atheistic.
[01:32:24.066 --> 01:32:24.807]  I mean, come on.
[01:32:24.947 --> 01:32:27.869]  That's what preachers are supposed to do is go get people to
[01:32:28.533 --> 01:32:29.013]  We're good to go.
[01:32:55.359 --> 01:32:57.820]  And they're like, well, I don't know that because they don't know any history.
[01:32:57.900 --> 01:32:59.100]  Well, it's true.
[01:32:59.481 --> 01:33:00.061]  No, it's not.
[01:33:00.761 --> 01:33:03.402]  Well, did you know that you get arrested over there if you proselytize?
[01:33:03.482 --> 01:33:04.182]  I don't believe that.
[01:33:04.602 --> 01:33:07.203]  Or if you find a Christian who does know about it, they go, well, they have to.
[01:33:07.704 --> 01:33:08.664]  They just can't have.
[01:33:08.684 --> 01:33:10.405]  Well, would that be okay over here?
[01:33:11.665 --> 01:33:17.747]  Well, so it's really weird, and it's a problem.
[01:33:18.668 --> 01:33:19.488]  It's a big problem.
[01:33:22.333 --> 01:33:32.800]  So let's go ahead and go back to Mr. Crowley and Pastor Crowley, and we'll take some of your calls on this subject and others here in a few minutes when I specifically find out what college is specifically for our guest, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:33.641 --> 01:33:39.184]  Pastor Crowley, can you answer that question for me?
[01:33:39.204 --> 01:33:43.687]  I mean, why is it anti-Christian to criticize Israel?
[01:33:43.828 --> 01:33:45.889]  I've been told this, that you're not allowed to criticize Israel.
[01:33:45.909 --> 01:33:48.110]  Well, all the prophets criticized Israel.
[01:33:48.130 --> 01:33:50.272]  They were there calling God's people back
[01:33:51.332 --> 01:33:58.618]  And then you talk to people and they say censorship is good over there, that Christians shouldn't proselytize.
[01:33:58.998 --> 01:34:00.920]  What has happened to Christians in America?
[01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:01.901]  What's happened to Christendom?
[01:34:02.981 --> 01:34:09.607]  A lot of it, Alex, is a consequence of Schofield dispensationalism.
[01:34:10.447 --> 01:34:16.152]  When Schofield wrote his notes, he did his best to exalt Israel, put Israel first.
[01:34:16.592 --> 01:34:18.354]  He even put Israel above the church.
[01:34:19.485 --> 01:34:21.166]  Read his notes in the New Testament.
[01:34:21.326 --> 01:34:26.548]  Many times he denigrates the church, the body of Christ, and exalts Israel.
[01:34:27.068 --> 01:34:31.309]  He never has anything bad to say about it.
[01:34:31.349 --> 01:34:40.753]  And this Schofield Bible, this Schofield dispensationalism, has influenced the church of Jesus Christ around the world.
[01:34:41.368 --> 01:34:46.972]  To exalt Israel above even the church, the body of Jesus Christ.
[01:34:47.033 --> 01:34:49.454]  Well, let me just say something here that's important.
[01:34:49.975 --> 01:34:52.517]  Five, six years ago, I wouldn't bash Israel.
[01:34:52.577 --> 01:34:55.019]  I'd say, leave Israel alone, nothing against Israel.
[01:34:55.039 --> 01:34:59.382]  I knew that Israel had been involved in a lot of bad things, but you know, all these countries are corrupt.
[01:35:00.223 --> 01:35:05.167]  But if I didn't worship everything they did, like selling nuclear weapons components to Iran...
[01:35:05.842 --> 01:35:06.642]  We're good to go.
[01:35:23.070 --> 01:35:36.035]  You know, in Sunday school, every prophet came and criticized, and God would judge Israel with foreign nations in captivity, and Jesus criticized what Israel was doing, and isn't that the... I don't understand what you're saying.
[01:35:36.435 --> 01:35:39.396]  They're like, you don't say a word, you worship Israel.
[01:35:39.716 --> 01:35:42.777]  So really, we don't worship Jesus Christ, we worship Israel now.
[01:35:42.997 --> 01:35:48.739]  Yes, the God's chosen people myth, and as I say, it came out of Scofield dispensationalism,
[01:35:49.463 --> 01:35:50.504]  More than any other.
[01:35:50.564 --> 01:35:52.565]  And Schofield is dangerous.
[01:35:52.885 --> 01:35:54.065]  It's insidious.
[01:35:55.026 --> 01:35:56.487]  And it is weakened.
[01:35:56.687 --> 01:35:59.528]  Well, didn't he come up with the whole rapture thing?
[01:36:00.308 --> 01:36:02.410]  Well, this is all related to Israel.
[01:36:02.450 --> 01:36:11.314]  He said, if we help the Jews get back to Palestine, then we can hasten the coming of Christ and the rapture will take place and remove us all.
[01:36:11.434 --> 01:36:11.954]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:36:12.014 --> 01:36:14.075]  Man can make God do things.
[01:36:14.115 --> 01:36:14.696]  That's right.
[01:36:15.656 --> 01:36:19.098]  My friend Grace Hossel called it forcing God's hand.
[01:36:20.081 --> 01:36:22.303]  She wrote a book, and that was the title of the book.
[01:36:22.383 --> 01:36:24.225]  Many of your listeners have it, I'm sure.
[01:36:24.645 --> 01:36:26.006]  Forcing God's Hand.
[01:36:26.487 --> 01:36:30.590]  Making God hurry something up that we want to see hurried up.
[01:36:30.911 --> 01:36:35.935]  Well, that's what the devil did that got him thrown out of heaven.
[01:36:35.955 --> 01:36:36.395]  True.
[01:36:36.415 --> 01:36:40.699]  And we're experiencing exactly the same thing the Apostle Paul experienced.
[01:36:40.739 --> 01:36:46.464]  He said, these Jews have tried to hinder me preaching the gospel of the grace of God.
[01:36:47.130 --> 01:36:51.252]  The Book of Revelation talks about those who are claimed to be Jews.
[01:36:51.292 --> 01:36:51.833]  They're not.
[01:36:51.873 --> 01:36:53.473]  They're of the synagogue of Satan.
[01:36:54.074 --> 01:36:56.015]  So there are these imposters.
[01:36:56.775 --> 01:37:06.000]  And one of the dangerous things that's going on now is that a lot of these people, we call them neocons, they want to rule the world.
[01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:10.122]  They're behind this one-world government, new world order business.
[01:37:10.763 --> 01:37:13.144]  And George Bush is one of their puppets.
[01:37:13.971 --> 01:37:15.332]  He's doing their bidding.
[01:37:15.853 --> 01:37:17.414]  Well, back to the censorship.
[01:37:17.434 --> 01:37:21.357]  You and your family, 50 years on the radio there.
[01:37:21.417 --> 01:37:22.578]  You haven't changed what you're doing.
[01:37:23.018 --> 01:37:25.621]  I guess it was just becoming a little too effective.
[01:37:25.681 --> 01:37:30.505]  I think these boys are on the run now, and that's why all over the place they're trying to censor and control.
[01:37:30.805 --> 01:37:36.630]  Well, I'm happy to know that it has been effective, but I haven't changed.
[01:37:36.730 --> 01:37:39.051]  I didn't change the broadcast in 20 years.
[01:37:39.192 --> 01:37:40.613]  Something is taking place.
[01:37:41.485 --> 01:37:43.686]  That has brought this to the attention.
[01:37:43.726 --> 01:37:44.847]  Did you ask them why?
[01:37:44.867 --> 01:37:46.408]  I mean, did you say, who's threatening you?
[01:37:46.588 --> 01:37:48.009]  Or, I mean, what happened?
[01:37:48.029 --> 01:37:49.589]  Did you say, I can't make those changes?
[01:37:49.629 --> 01:37:50.670]  And they said, you're off the air?
[01:37:50.710 --> 01:37:51.150]  What happened?
[01:37:52.271 --> 01:37:53.271]  Here's what happened.
[01:37:53.732 --> 01:37:54.552]  Just bear with me.
[01:37:54.652 --> 01:37:58.794]  I was told not to mention Israel and the Jews anymore on any of my radio programs.
[01:38:00.195 --> 01:38:04.417]  I was told that two broadcasts on the next day, Saturday, would not be permitted.
[01:38:04.878 --> 01:38:09.200]  They were afraid of me getting on another broadcast and talking about being
[01:38:10.596 --> 01:38:13.738]  Gagged on the other one, on the Focus on Israel.
[01:38:14.659 --> 01:38:21.144]  I was told that Focus on Israel would be discontinued immediately and permanently, never to be broadcast again.
[01:38:21.164 --> 01:38:23.526]  I was not given the opportunity.
[01:38:24.006 --> 01:38:26.648]  I was forbidden to make any more live programs.
[01:38:26.708 --> 01:38:35.175]  In other words, if I broadcast an up-to-date program on that station now, it has to be pre-recorded and approved.
[01:38:37.036 --> 01:38:37.937]  Later in the day...
[01:38:39.281 --> 01:38:50.227]  On the same day, March the 3rd, I was told that I wouldn't be given the opportunity to go on the air and tell my listeners what had happened.
[01:38:53.789 --> 01:38:59.512]  Well, Alex, the uproar has been unbelievable.
[01:38:59.652 --> 01:39:05.835]  I understand that the station has received hundreds of emails and phone calls from around the
[01:39:08.205 --> 01:39:16.952]  Well, Mr. Crowley, I think it's simpler for you to just get a podcast going and to go get some time on another station and just stop even giving these buffoons attention.
[01:39:17.473 --> 01:39:27.341]  Two days later, my grandson, Joel Overstreet, listens to you, and his wife, Susie, is a computer geek.
[01:39:28.022 --> 01:39:31.305]  She's got me now on the Internet, Crowley's Focus on Israel.
[01:39:32.034 --> 01:39:34.598]  So the Focus on Israel ministry is not dead.
[01:39:34.618 --> 01:39:36.100]  It's still alive and well.
[01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:41.607]  We'll make sure we get a link to Crowley's Focus on Israel dot... That's Crowley's Focus on Israel.
[01:39:41.628 --> 01:39:44.191]  That's the name of the Internet site.
[01:39:44.211 --> 01:39:44.812]  What's the final?
[01:39:44.872 --> 01:39:46.094]  Is it com, org, net?
[01:39:47.175 --> 01:39:48.777]  You know, I don't know about that.
[01:39:49.477 --> 01:39:51.978]  I'm a Neanderthal when it comes to this high-tech stuff.
[01:39:52.919 --> 01:39:54.400]  I'm an old man, Alex.
[01:39:54.500 --> 01:39:56.041]  We'll find it.
[01:39:56.361 --> 01:39:58.962]  Your web presence will be bigger than that pathetic radio station.
[01:39:59.042 --> 01:40:03.605]  You Google in Crowley in Israel and you'll get the website, I'm sure.
[01:40:04.165 --> 01:40:05.126]  I hope so, anyway.
[01:40:05.246 --> 01:40:05.786]  Yeah, I know.
[01:40:06.146 --> 01:40:09.268]  Until they start censoring that, Rupert Murdoch's already trying with MySpace.
[01:40:10.449 --> 01:40:12.710]  But, well, I mean, this is just, you know, something...
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:14.661]  They don't.
[01:40:14.701 --> 01:40:14.921]  No.
[01:40:14.961 --> 01:40:15.141]  Yeah.
[01:40:32.277 --> 01:40:37.444]  You know, these folks from Hazaria, these European folks, they're not even really Jews to begin with.
[01:40:37.485 --> 01:40:38.726]  Ashkenazi Jews, yeah.
[01:40:38.766 --> 01:40:47.038]  Yeah, and they're busy microwaving the Sephardi Jews, and I'm sure you know about killing all those Jewish kids, and I'm back because I don't want them to kill Jewish children.
[01:40:47.398 --> 01:40:47.618]  Yeah.
[01:40:47.718 --> 01:40:51.179]  I mean, they microwaved them, radiated 110,000 of them when the U.S.
[01:40:51.219 --> 01:40:53.560]  government funded them to do that back in the 50 to 60.
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:41:01.483]  I mean, when you realize, and then you find out this group funded Hitler, they're really mad right now that big Jewish publications are now exposing them.
[01:41:01.503 --> 01:41:06.845]  Yeah, well, Yitzhak Shamir wrote a letter to Hitler telling him that they wanted to be one of his allies.
[01:41:07.365 --> 01:41:08.466]  After he had won the war.
[01:41:08.706 --> 01:41:09.346]  Well, exactly.
[01:41:09.426 --> 01:41:12.247]  So we're bad because we're against Hitler now, Pastor.
[01:41:12.488 --> 01:41:12.728]  Yeah.
[01:41:13.108 --> 01:41:14.829]  I guess we're anti-Semitic, huh?
[01:41:14.889 --> 01:41:15.089]  Yeah.
[01:41:15.189 --> 01:41:19.351]  You mentioned something a few minutes ago that reminded me of something I've got to mention.
[01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:25.702]  Did you know that Israel will not permit a Jew who is converted to Christianity to immigrate?
[01:41:26.203 --> 01:41:26.963]  Yes, I knew that.
[01:41:27.123 --> 01:41:30.504]  And they do not allow proselytizing on the streets or anywhere else.
[01:41:31.065 --> 01:41:33.426]  And they have full-page ads in major newspapers.
[01:41:33.746 --> 01:41:36.087]  The government does.
[01:41:36.187 --> 01:41:41.549]  10,000 Chinese workers came in a few months ago, and they told them, they said, if you date a Jew, you're going to be arrested.
[01:41:42.369 --> 01:41:45.231]  Now, can you imagine those racial purity laws in America?
[01:41:45.291 --> 01:41:46.732]  Suppose those things had happened.
[01:41:46.772 --> 01:41:55.637]  Suppose we built a wall 400 miles long, a foot thick and 25 feet high, to separate one group of people from another.
[01:41:56.618 --> 01:41:58.199]  But we helped pay for it over there.
[01:41:58.219 --> 01:42:02.281]  These are the kinds of things that I dealt with every Saturday.
[01:42:02.602 --> 01:42:09.266]  The truth, the reality, no lies, just the straight facts of what's taking place.
[01:42:09.286 --> 01:42:11.367]  Well, you know, the truth cannot be contained because...
[01:42:12.291 --> 01:42:14.692]  People tried to pick on me when I didn't even do anything.
[01:42:14.832 --> 01:42:15.652]  I now talk about it.
[01:42:16.152 --> 01:42:17.192]  Now they've picked on you.
[01:42:17.212 --> 01:42:19.953]  Everybody's going to hear what you have to say on wider audiences.
[01:42:19.973 --> 01:42:20.273]  Yeah.
[01:42:20.693 --> 01:42:23.354]  I hope I hear you on 50 Patriot Radio shows.
[01:42:24.134 --> 01:42:29.536]  Well, Alex, how can I listen to you here in the Washington, D.C., northern Virginia, Baltimore area?
[01:42:29.596 --> 01:42:36.698]  We had an affiliate there for about eight months, and the government went absolutely ape and pressured the station to kick us all off.
[01:42:37.038 --> 01:42:37.678]  Oh, oh.
[01:42:38.399 --> 01:42:39.339]  What station was that?
[01:42:39.359 --> 01:42:39.859]  Do you remember?
[01:42:39.999 --> 01:42:40.640]  I forget.
[01:42:40.660 --> 01:42:41.180]  There's so many.
[01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:41.580]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:42.760]  There's so many around here.
[01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:43.520]  It doesn't matter.
[01:42:43.580 --> 01:42:45.361]  Every station we get, we lose.
[01:42:45.401 --> 01:42:46.681]  We just get more.
[01:42:46.941 --> 01:42:50.982]  But my grandson, Joel Overstreet, he gets you, I think, on the Internet.
[01:42:51.642 --> 01:42:53.983]  Yeah, you can go to Infowars.com.
[01:42:54.283 --> 01:42:54.543]  Uh-huh.
[01:42:54.623 --> 01:42:55.323]  That's what he does.
[01:42:55.583 --> 01:42:57.383]  Or PrisonPlanet.com, Pastor.
[01:42:57.403 --> 01:42:59.204]  Yeah, that's the one that he accesses.
[01:42:59.244 --> 01:42:59.524]  Yeah.
[01:43:00.143 --> 01:43:03.084]  And there's always the network site, GCN Live.
[01:43:03.324 --> 01:43:05.205]  It's the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:43:05.425 --> 01:43:06.505]  Genesis Communications.
[01:43:06.705 --> 01:43:08.206]  Yes, we're on Christian stations.
[01:43:08.526 --> 01:43:10.427]  We're on Air America liberal stations.
[01:43:10.767 --> 01:43:12.507]  We're on libertarian stations.
[01:43:12.527 --> 01:43:13.728]  We're on conservative stations.
[01:43:14.168 --> 01:43:20.670]  Stations that are owned by private groups or individuals who are informed and have just checked out what I claim.
[01:43:20.690 --> 01:43:21.951]  See, it's not a radical program.
[01:43:22.331 --> 01:43:24.712]  Everything we talk about is admitted and in everybody's face.
[01:43:25.412 --> 01:43:28.053]  And it sounds radical to a new listener, but it's just what's going on.
[01:43:28.633 --> 01:43:29.673]  You know, I got a question, though.
[01:43:29.693 --> 01:43:36.054]  So I guess we're going to have a policy here in America, like it is in Israel, where you just don't criticize anybody.
[01:43:36.094 --> 01:43:37.275]  You just keep your mouth shut.
[01:43:37.895 --> 01:43:38.875]  I think that's coming.
[01:43:39.375 --> 01:43:47.976]  I think that kind of censorship and that kind of surveillance and management of communication is going to happen.
[01:43:48.176 --> 01:43:50.597]  But America didn't do anything to Israel.
[01:43:51.057 --> 01:43:52.757]  America went and fought Hitler.
[01:43:53.177 --> 01:43:54.117]  I haven't done anything.
[01:43:54.177 --> 01:43:54.817]  I'm tired of it.
[01:43:54.837 --> 01:43:56.118]  I'm not guilty of anything.
[01:43:56.138 --> 01:43:57.658]  I want to be left alone.
[01:43:58.644 --> 01:44:00.744]  Well, let me tell you something funny, Alex.
[01:44:01.585 --> 01:44:03.245]  I just wrote a book last year.
[01:44:03.325 --> 01:44:07.346]  It's called On the Wrong Side of Just About Everything but Right About It All.
[01:44:08.466 --> 01:44:10.886]  And I dedicated it to WFAX.
[01:44:11.807 --> 01:44:20.148]  I mentioned the founders and the owners by name and everybody on the staff on the dedication page.
[01:44:20.168 --> 01:44:24.929]  And the book touts itself on the front page and also on the back cover as
[01:44:25.612 --> 01:44:30.796]  As containing messages actually broadcast on a Washington, D.C.
[01:44:30.856 --> 01:44:33.297]  region radio station, WFAX.
[01:44:33.757 --> 01:44:37.420]  Now, I was proud of that, but I think it got back to them.
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:41.082]  Of course, I got their approval to dedicate the book to them.
[01:44:41.903 --> 01:44:46.646]  But I think it's backfired, and it was more of an embarrassment now than anything else.
[01:44:46.746 --> 01:44:47.406]  I hope not.
[01:44:48.287 --> 01:44:50.468]  But that's the irony of ironies that I...
[01:44:53.494 --> 01:44:59.019]  I dedicated the book to the radio station that gagged me for what I had put in the book.
[01:45:01.901 --> 01:45:06.305]  Well, it's just unbelievable that this type of stuff goes on.
[01:45:06.345 --> 01:45:13.250]  You know, in Canada and areas of Northern Europe, they are banning reading certain passages out of the whole of the New Testament.
[01:45:13.270 --> 01:45:14.031]  I'm sure you're aware of that.
[01:45:14.251 --> 01:45:14.992]  Yes, yes.
[01:45:15.332 --> 01:45:17.314]  So, I mean, we're becoming communist China, folks.
[01:45:18.610 --> 01:45:21.031]  And then meanwhile, you know, I've studied the New World Order, Pastor.
[01:45:21.051 --> 01:45:23.311]  Did you know it's run by Nazi devil worshippers?
[01:45:24.592 --> 01:45:25.672]  Uh, no, I didn't know that.
[01:45:25.972 --> 01:45:26.192]  No.
[01:45:26.292 --> 01:45:32.774]  Yeah, I've really, really studied it, and at the highest levels, even some of these so-called Zionist leaders really aren't even what you'd call a Zionist.
[01:45:32.794 --> 01:45:34.134]  They're just into the occult.
[01:45:35.475 --> 01:45:36.675]  I'm aware of that.
[01:45:37.275 --> 01:45:38.115]  I'm aware of that.
[01:45:38.595 --> 01:45:47.398]  And this is something that comes up in these newspapers forward in Washington Jewish Week every once in a while, and I expose that on the program...
[01:45:48.548 --> 01:45:53.610]  Everything that the Bible is against, Jewish leaders are on the front lines.
[01:45:53.670 --> 01:45:59.913]  I'm talking about sodomy, pornography, abortion, evolutionism.
[01:46:01.274 --> 01:46:11.838]  Everything that the Bible teaches against is praised in the Jewish press, in the Forward newspaper, in the Washington Jewish Week.
[01:46:12.498 --> 01:46:13.839]  It's in there every week.
[01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:25.789]  And this is one of the things that made up the content of my program, these outrageous, occultic, satanic things that the Jews are into, and they're proud of it.
[01:46:27.370 --> 01:46:29.952]  Well, certainly a large segment of a particular leadership.
[01:46:30.453 --> 01:46:33.435]  Well, regardless, you should be able to have your free speech.
[01:46:33.495 --> 01:46:36.077]  Somebody should be able to go on that radio station and say you're an idiot.
[01:46:36.850 --> 01:46:39.692]  And, you know, you should be able to go back and expose them.
[01:46:40.533 --> 01:46:46.516]  But all across the board, whether it's liberal or conservative, we're losing free speech at every level.
[01:46:47.137 --> 01:46:50.319]  And, I mean, just down the street protesting, they're trying to restrict that.
[01:46:50.779 --> 01:46:52.440]  And it's a very, very dangerous trend.
[01:46:52.500 --> 01:46:54.141]  Pastor, I want to thank you.
[01:46:54.161 --> 01:46:58.824]  Well, I want you to understand one more thing, Alex, before we close out here.
[01:46:58.844 --> 01:47:00.105]  Sure, we're almost out of time, Pastor.
[01:47:00.185 --> 01:47:01.506]  All right, very quickly.
[01:47:01.786 --> 01:47:04.588]  WFAX is not a Christian station per se.
[01:47:04.688 --> 01:47:05.949]  It's a commercial station.
[01:47:06.573 --> 01:47:07.994]  No, I understand what you're saying.
[01:47:28.493 --> 01:47:30.395]  And it's going around the world.
[01:47:30.615 --> 01:47:35.679]  www.wfax.com Boy, they're going to get mad at you doing these interviews now, though.
[01:47:35.899 --> 01:47:36.580]  I know they are.
[01:47:36.980 --> 01:47:37.681]  I know they are.
[01:47:37.821 --> 01:47:38.962]  And that's the tragic thing.
[01:47:39.022 --> 01:47:50.251]  I started out the broadcast by saying... But what happens if you get on the air and say, Israel doesn't allow Jews to marry outside Jews in Israel.
[01:47:50.552 --> 01:47:52.113]  Why do they have racial purity laws?
[01:47:52.153 --> 01:47:54.655]  What would happen to you if you said that on your King's business show?
[01:47:54.895 --> 01:47:56.656]  They won't let me on live anymore.
[01:47:56.736 --> 01:47:57.836]  Everything is recorded.
[01:47:57.876 --> 01:48:01.677]  I've got several hundred programs from the past that are being aired now.
[01:48:02.297 --> 01:48:03.778]  Oh, they're phasing you out, brother.
[01:48:03.958 --> 01:48:05.238]  Hey, good hearing from you, Pastor.
[01:48:05.298 --> 01:48:07.259]  I'm afraid I'm being phased out, Alex.
[01:48:07.499 --> 01:48:08.639]  Well, you're not obsolete.
[01:48:08.679 --> 01:48:09.659]  Don't worry.
[01:48:09.839 --> 01:48:11.120]  And don't get phased out.
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:11.940]  Don't get gagged.
[01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:12.700]  All right.
[01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:13.280]  Take care, Pastor.
[01:48:13.300 --> 01:48:14.060]  This has been great.
[01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:15.641]  God bless you and all your listeners.
[01:48:15.861 --> 01:48:16.341]  Thank you, sir.
[01:48:16.381 --> 01:48:18.422]  God bless you, too.
[01:48:18.462 --> 01:48:19.342]  Well, there you have it.
[01:48:20.425 --> 01:48:21.665]  And it's a reign of terror.
[01:48:21.685 --> 01:48:25.286]  You know, liberals listening right now, you're having your free speech taken.
[01:48:25.306 --> 01:48:26.307]  You're being restricted.
[01:48:26.807 --> 01:48:27.787]  He's being restricted.
[01:48:28.027 --> 01:48:31.948]  And I mean, if that isn't political insanity, I don't even call it correctness.
[01:48:33.148 --> 01:48:36.889]  I mean, what, 60% in a major poll just a few months ago in Israel?
[01:48:36.969 --> 01:48:40.090]  Jews that are against the war and against what their government's doing?
[01:48:40.130 --> 01:48:40.971]  Are they all evil?
[01:48:41.031 --> 01:48:42.451]  Should they all be gagged?
[01:48:44.048 --> 01:48:55.854]  You know, again, the Jewish people are a very diverse group of folks, but the labor Zionist crowd that now masquerades as Likudniks are anything but conservative, and they are anti-Christian.
[01:48:56.414 --> 01:48:58.255]  And people have the right to say that.
[01:48:58.275 --> 01:49:00.256]  They also target the Orthodox Jews.
[01:49:00.976 --> 01:49:08.480]  I've read a lot, it's in big Jewish magazines and newspapers, that they target the Orthodox and CPS their kids, grab their kids, and
[01:49:10.251 --> 01:49:13.372]  You've seen them stomping on the settlers and doing all the rest of it.
[01:49:13.812 --> 01:49:16.674]  It's really bad.
[01:49:17.995 --> 01:49:23.958]  And so I think it's important to not... I mean, I get criticized because I won't get up here and... It'd be like George Bush.
[01:49:24.038 --> 01:49:25.438]  Bush is supposedly a German name.
[01:49:25.979 --> 01:49:27.920]  George Bush is bad, but Germans aren't bad.
[01:49:28.140 --> 01:49:30.381]  Hitler was bad, but Germans aren't bad.
[01:49:31.181 --> 01:49:33.823]  But free speech, it's just...
[01:49:35.231 --> 01:49:36.512]  She's under attack in this country.
[01:49:36.532 --> 01:49:37.793]  We'll come back and take your calls.
[01:49:38.273 --> 01:49:42.456]  Got a whole other hour coming up, but final segment in this hour.
[01:49:42.476 --> 01:49:45.758]  We'll go right to your calls on the other side of this quick break.
[01:49:45.858 --> 01:49:48.380]  So stay with me, prisonplanet.tv, infowars.com.
[01:49:53.729 --> 01:50:01.095]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:50:01.376 --> 01:50:06.120]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:50:06.340 --> 01:50:11.985]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:50:12.225 --> 01:50:16.746]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:50:16.966 --> 01:50:24.129]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:50:24.149 --> 01:50:28.670]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:50:28.830 --> 01:50:31.351]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:50:31.571 --> 01:50:38.293]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:50:38.513 --> 01:50:43.775]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.

[01:50:53.021 --> 01:50:57.965]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[01:50:58.265 --> 01:51:03.730]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[01:51:03.750 --> 01:51:08.053]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[01:51:08.393 --> 01:51:11.416]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[01:51:11.716 --> 01:51:15.159]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[01:51:15.479 --> 01:51:24.826]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[01:51:25.086 --> 01:51:28.588]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[01:51:28.829 --> 01:51:35.954]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[01:52:29.301 --> 01:52:29.801]  We're good to go.
[01:52:29.901 --> 01:52:30.182]  I think?
[01:53:01.517 --> 01:53:02.138]  Welcome back.
[01:53:02.158 --> 01:53:10.262]  Let's go ahead and go to some of your calls, then I'll get into Bush shining bills that weren't passed by the Congress and...
[01:53:28.539 --> 01:53:29.620]  A lot of other insanity.
[01:53:30.180 --> 01:53:32.301]  John in Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[01:53:32.341 --> 01:53:32.662]  Welcome.
[01:53:37.144 --> 01:53:39.185]  Okay, he's not there.
[01:53:39.746 --> 01:53:40.867]  Who's up next after him?
[01:53:43.488 --> 01:53:45.129]  Ian in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[01:53:45.189 --> 01:53:45.609]  Go ahead.
[01:53:46.030 --> 01:53:46.690]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:53:47.090 --> 01:53:47.370]  Yes.
[01:53:47.911 --> 01:53:57.897]  I was watching news the other night, and immediately after they said that the Dubai port deal was falling through, it had on the bottom of the ticker news
[01:53:59.523 --> 01:54:12.390]  Yeah, and then I was aware of that, and then they sell it to themselves at reduced prices.
[01:54:12.910 --> 01:54:19.894]  You have the president, who is a major shareholder, as well as his father, his mother, the Queen of England, the Bin Laden family, the UAE folks.
[01:54:20.663 --> 01:54:33.351]  And then they become the holding company and start gobbling up the roads, and then local counties, cities, and states sign over the roads and then even pay the toll road companies to run the tolls.
[01:54:33.431 --> 01:54:38.734]  So it's just a total scam, total profiteering, total criminality everywhere.
[01:54:38.754 --> 01:54:44.157]  And of course, Halliburton is going to be taking over the UAE deal as a holding company for Dubai Ports World.
[01:54:44.577 --> 01:54:45.838]  That doesn't surprise me.
[01:54:46.810 --> 01:54:51.712]  Hey, but we can put out Neocon t-shirts saying, I love Halliburton.
[01:54:52.412 --> 01:54:53.453]  Another quick question.
[01:54:54.693 --> 01:54:58.915]  We've been getting inundated here with all this child pornography on the Internet.
[01:54:59.675 --> 01:55:00.596]  And it's really...
[01:55:01.604 --> 01:55:12.570]  Going wild around here in Pennsylvania, and I was just curious if you think that might be a way of the government overseeing or overtaking the Internet as far as information.
[01:55:12.590 --> 01:55:16.092]  Well, I mean, what do you mean going wild?
[01:55:16.132 --> 01:55:19.734]  I mean, they've been having a bunch of busts, international busts I've seen in the news.
[01:55:19.954 --> 01:55:25.497]  Well, they've been doing that, and then plus that's all you've been seeing on the news, morning, noon, and evening news.
[01:55:25.917 --> 01:55:28.679]  Well, I mean, I was going to talk about this today.
[01:55:28.699 --> 01:55:34.884]  I have it in a stack where they have this big international bust, and Eliot Spitzer and Gonzalez are up there together.
[01:55:35.424 --> 01:55:41.168]  Understand, there are lobbyists on Capitol Hill for the white slavery rings.
[01:55:42.289 --> 01:55:50.194]  I mean, the slavery is bigger than African slaves to this country, the numbers, in an average year, not over 300 years of it.
[01:55:52.260 --> 01:55:57.768]  And it's openly, much of it is sexual, it is public, it is admitted, and nothing's done.
[01:55:57.989 --> 01:56:01.453]  And Rumsfeld's asked about it by Cynthia McKinney, and he says we're not going to do anything.
[01:56:02.375 --> 01:56:08.063]  And then meanwhile, the very same people involved in all this run around posing as if they're going to keep us all safe from this stuff.
[01:56:08.900 --> 01:56:09.861]  And it's just more of the same.
[01:56:09.881 --> 01:56:12.083]  It's like they go bust a few low-level drug dealers.
[01:56:12.103 --> 01:56:14.865]  Meanwhile, they're bringing in the majority of the drugs.
[01:56:14.925 --> 01:56:19.048]  And yes, that's why they want to have Internet IDs and Internet 2 and track everything.
[01:56:19.108 --> 01:56:21.610]  And yeah, that's another one of their excuses to take over the web.
[01:56:22.071 --> 01:56:24.933]  As if they can't go and bust these people instantly.
[01:56:25.293 --> 01:56:29.897]  You know, we've had feds on, retired people who've actually tracked this, and New York City detectives and others.
[01:56:30.317 --> 01:56:32.539]  And every time it led to politicians, it was shut down.
[01:56:33.695 --> 01:56:40.659]  I mean, this stuff just didn't even really exist until this elite took over in the last 50 years, and now it's metastasizing.
[01:56:40.699 --> 01:56:41.740]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:43.041]  I know.
[01:56:43.541 --> 01:56:44.441]  Okay, well, that's it.
[01:56:44.461 --> 01:56:45.362]  You're doing a great job.
[01:56:45.882 --> 01:56:46.523]  Thank you, sir.
[01:56:46.663 --> 01:56:50.165]  Yeah, it is hellish.
[01:56:51.245 --> 01:56:55.648]  Before we end the show and come back and talk to Tim and many others that are patiently holding,
[01:56:56.914 --> 01:57:11.300]  PrisonPlanet.tv, all 14 of my full-length feature films, all my new films when they come out, weeks before they're available in DVD, all my weekly TV reports, video reports with guests in studio, so much more.

[01:57:22.886 --> 01:57:23.446]  So much more.

[01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:49.461]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.101 --> 01:57:51.182]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:51.882 --> 01:57:53.003]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:53.644 --> 01:57:54.444]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.225 --> 01:57:56.106]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.786 --> 01:58:00.509]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:00.969 --> 01:58:05.092]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.793 --> 01:58:18.022]  I'm going to roll this little piece, an oldie but a goodie that folks have been requesting, and we'll go to break, come back and start taking your calls and get into all the big international and national news.
[01:58:19.167 --> 01:58:22.712]  So go ahead and hit it, and we'll be right back.
[01:58:24.074 --> 01:58:26.257]  Everything I'm going to tell you is classified, Tom.
[01:58:26.397 --> 01:58:33.006]  Now let's take a closer look at what happened on September 11, 2001, and how it's being used to usher in...
[01:58:35.530 --> 01:58:35.830]  I think?
[01:59:05.410 --> 01:59:06.491]  We're better for this.
[01:59:25.207 --> 01:59:33.390]  The global crime syndicate that George W. Bush and his family fronts for has everything to gain from the September 11th attacks.
[01:59:33.730 --> 01:59:37.991]  A nationalized econ, a national control grid, a taxless society.
[01:59:38.071 --> 01:59:40.192]  What we're witnessing is the conscription.
[01:59:40.732 --> 01:59:42.274]  We're good to go.
[01:59:58.307 --> 02:00:01.589]  I know that dumbed down the masses with public education.
[02:00:01.609 --> 02:00:04.550]  They kept us distracted with waste driven enslavement.
[02:00:04.590 --> 02:00:10.213]  They kept us confused with media and news and rubbed it in our face with coincidental clues.
[02:00:10.473 --> 02:00:16.296]  They kept us from uniting with social divisions, politics, religion, not to mention racial tensions.
[02:00:16.316 --> 02:00:20.818]  They kept themselves hidden through history books rewritten in the plot for world control.
[02:00:20.838 --> 02:00:22.359]  9-11 was the lynchpin.
[02:00:22.379 --> 02:00:24.280]  Power hungry politicians, nothing more than
[02:00:29.006 --> 02:00:45.011]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarned influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[02:00:45.651 --> 02:00:50.912]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[02:00:52.433 --> 02:00:56.934]  We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democracy.
[02:00:57.461 --> 02:00:58.182]  We're good to go.
[02:00:58.202 --> 02:00:59.022]  We're good to go.
[02:01:22.296 --> 02:01:22.396]  John?
[02:01:44.344 --> 02:01:47.767]  We're dealing with a group of predators.
[02:01:47.907 --> 02:01:50.348]  An elite that sees us as cattle.
[02:01:50.448 --> 02:01:51.569]  As their slaves.
[02:01:51.589 --> 02:01:54.632]  The globalists have America and Europe in their grasp.
[02:01:54.972 --> 02:01:56.393]  Today.
[02:01:56.453 --> 02:01:57.333]  Tomorrow.
[02:01:57.414 --> 02:01:58.094]  They want the world.
[02:01:58.114 --> 02:01:59.315]  There is a chance.
[02:01:59.375 --> 02:02:10.943]  There is a chance for the President of the United States to use this disaster to carry out what his father, a phrase his father used I think only once, and hasn't been used since.
[02:02:11.003 --> 02:02:12.284]  And that is a New World Order.
[02:02:12.384 --> 02:02:13.065]  A New World Order.
[02:02:15.097 --> 02:02:15.797]  All right, folks.
[02:02:16.357 --> 02:02:19.558]  We have two versions of that in the computer up at the network.
[02:02:21.538 --> 02:02:23.599]  The wrong one got played, but that's okay.
[02:02:23.619 --> 02:02:25.959]  It doesn't really matter compared to the New World Order taking over.
[02:02:25.999 --> 02:02:27.199]  So for that, I'm sorry.
[02:02:27.819 --> 02:02:28.980]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:29.440]  Stay with us.
[02:02:44.753 --> 02:02:55.476]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:02:55.677 --> 02:03:03.239]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:03:03.479 --> 02:03:12.670]  Farmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels, and it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:03:12.950 --> 02:03:19.098]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[02:03:19.438 --> 02:03:23.360]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:25.281]  The water level is always visible.
[02:03:25.461 --> 02:03:31.425]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[02:03:31.645 --> 02:03:35.907]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:03:45.791 --> 02:03:48.653]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:03:48.914 --> 02:03:49.594]  Hello, my friends.
[02:03:49.694 --> 02:03:50.475]  Alex Jones here.
[02:03:50.835 --> 02:03:55.499]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:03:55.839 --> 02:04:02.585]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:04:02.905 --> 02:04:04.886]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:04:05.087 --> 02:04:07.928]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:04:08.028 --> 02:04:12.691]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:04:12.891 --> 02:04:17.274]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:04:17.534 --> 02:04:24.759]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:04:25.019 --> 02:04:27.441]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:04:27.601 --> 02:04:29.322]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:04:44.935 --> 02:04:47.017]  Gee, honey, those new sandals look great on you.
[02:04:47.217 --> 02:04:49.458]  And look, they show off my new toenails, too.
[02:04:49.779 --> 02:04:50.439]  New toenails?
[02:04:50.819 --> 02:04:51.800]  What happened to the old ones?
[02:04:52.801 --> 02:04:55.483]  Well, they're not really new, just clear and healthy looking.
[02:04:56.003 --> 02:04:57.444]  Remember how embarrassed I was?
[02:04:57.464 --> 02:05:00.246]  They were so discolored, really awful looking.
[02:05:00.486 --> 02:05:01.567]  Well, they sure are clear now.
[02:05:02.007 --> 02:05:03.689]  Gosh, I wish I could wear sandals again.
[02:05:03.849 --> 02:05:05.210]  My toenails are a disaster.
[02:05:05.270 --> 02:05:08.072]  Look, this one looks white, and that one's thick and yellow.
[02:05:08.292 --> 02:05:09.493]  Well, here's my secret.
[02:05:10.073 --> 02:05:11.134]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:05:11.594 --> 02:05:15.676]  It clears out yellowing keratin debris, the source of nail discoloration.
[02:05:16.136 --> 02:05:17.037]  Ah, so that's it.
[02:05:17.257 --> 02:05:19.558]  I've got ugly keratin debris built up under my nails.
[02:05:19.838 --> 02:05:21.479]  And Non-X Nail Gel gets rid of it.
[02:05:21.499 --> 02:05:25.041]  Now, you'll need to use it every day, but clear nails are worth it.
[02:05:25.061 --> 02:05:26.022]  You bet.
[02:05:26.222 --> 02:05:30.324]  You know, when we go to the beach this summer, my toenails are going to look just as good as yours do.
[02:05:30.464 --> 02:05:31.885]  Thanks to Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:05:32.365 --> 02:05:35.367]  Nunnex Nail Gel for clear, healthy-looking nails.
[02:05:35.727 --> 02:05:42.111]  Now at Walgreens, Rite Aid, Eckerd, Brooks, Longs, Duane Reade, and Walmart in the foot care section.
[02:05:43.813 --> 02:05:46.014]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:46.594 --> 02:05:49.456]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:53.399 --> 02:05:57.121]  All right, Tim, Leo, Robert, Barron, Jeff, others, your calls are coming up.
[02:05:57.141 --> 02:05:58.482]  Let's just take a lot of calls this hour.
[02:05:58.502 --> 02:05:58.562]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:02.250 --> 02:06:03.711]  Let me read this article, though, first.
[02:06:03.791 --> 02:06:04.732]  It's from Raw Story.
[02:06:05.313 --> 02:06:09.296]  Congressman writes, White House, did President knowingly sign law that didn't pass?
[02:06:09.376 --> 02:06:12.559]  And it's posted on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:21.908]  Representative Henry Waxman has alleged a letter to White House Chief of Staff Andrew Carr that President Bush signed a version of the budget...
[02:06:23.209 --> 02:06:24.530]  Now, understand this.
[02:06:52.478 --> 02:06:54.539]  There are 1,000 page bills passed every week.
[02:06:54.559 --> 02:06:57.240]  There are hundreds plus page bills passed every day.
[02:06:58.361 --> 02:06:59.882]  I mean, it's an insane asylum.
[02:06:59.902 --> 02:07:01.322]  What did they pass?
[02:07:01.382 --> 02:07:02.343]  What is it?
[02:07:02.763 --> 02:07:05.945]  16,000 something laws last year in the sessions.
[02:07:07.265 --> 02:07:08.986]  And then you got all the states doing the same thing.
[02:07:09.046 --> 02:07:10.767]  And in most cases, they don't even read them.
[02:07:10.787 --> 02:07:11.608]  They don't even write them.
[02:07:11.688 --> 02:07:16.990]  Lobbyists, over half, 52% are foreign registered lobbyists, write them.
[02:07:17.010 --> 02:07:20.212]  I mean, can you imagine foreigners write the laws and no one even reads it?
[02:07:24.099 --> 02:07:24.459]  Oh, really?
[02:07:24.499 --> 02:07:25.200]  That's admitted?
[02:07:25.480 --> 02:07:26.481]  Oh, we're not under tyranny.
[02:07:26.561 --> 02:07:26.821]  Oh, no.
[02:07:27.081 --> 02:07:28.783]  We're not under the control of foreign countries.
[02:07:29.704 --> 02:07:34.448]  Britain and France and Russia and China and Japan and Israel.
[02:07:35.568 --> 02:07:37.390]  It's mind-blowing.
[02:07:37.870 --> 02:07:40.032]  This is the type of hoax they engage in all the time.
[02:07:42.394 --> 02:07:46.297]  It's like Bush says, I don't care if you don't pass a law, I'll just say it's a law.
[02:07:46.638 --> 02:07:47.859]  I'll just keep enforcing it.
[02:07:47.879 --> 02:07:49.100]  It's just lawlessness.
[02:07:50.822 --> 02:07:52.402]  And they go through all the evidence of it here.
[02:07:52.422 --> 02:07:53.783]  This is a big, big deal.
[02:07:55.723 --> 02:07:59.364]  March 15, 2006, the Honorable Andrew Card, Chief of Staff.
[02:07:59.384 --> 02:08:03.084]  Can you imagine if there was a $2 billion bank robbery, how big that news would be?
[02:08:03.124 --> 02:08:10.486]  But see, they're going to give the port deals and the road deals to the Carlaw Group and Halliburton, and they'll be foreign subsidiaries, and it'll just all be public.
[02:08:10.526 --> 02:08:12.426]  And I'll go, well, Halliburton's conservative.
[02:08:12.526 --> 02:08:13.246]  I love it.
[02:08:13.526 --> 02:08:14.446]  The Arabs own them.
[02:08:15.827 --> 02:08:17.927]  The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
[02:08:19.053 --> 02:08:21.295]  Northwest Washington, D.C., 20500.
[02:08:21.415 --> 02:08:24.658]  Dear Mr. Carr, this is from the Chief of Staff to the Chief of Staff.
[02:08:25.418 --> 02:08:38.629]  On February 8, 2006, President Bush signed into law a version of the Deficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 2005 that was different in substance from the version that passed the U.S.
[02:08:38.649 --> 02:08:40.130]  House of Representatives.
[02:08:40.230 --> 02:08:44.834]  Legal scholars have advised me that the substantive differences...
[02:08:45.780 --> 02:08:57.482]  Between the differences, which involve $2 billion in federal spending, mean that the bill did not meet the fundamental constitutional requirement that both houses of Congress must pass any legislation signed into the law by the president.
[02:08:58.102 --> 02:09:00.483]  Well, most just have signing statements that do the same thing.
[02:09:01.383 --> 02:09:08.544]  I am writing to learn what the president and his staff knew about this constitutional defect at the time the president signed the legislation.
[02:09:08.584 --> 02:09:09.264]  Let me stop right there.
[02:09:10.344 --> 02:09:15.005]  It's like when every year Cynthia McKinney and others go, okay, now it's $5 trillion missing from the Pentagon.
[02:09:15.748 --> 02:09:17.289]  A couple years before, it's $3 trillion.
[02:09:17.829 --> 02:09:19.370]  Where is all this money going?
[02:09:20.271 --> 02:09:29.977]  People go, wait a minute, they only have a $600 billion funding package every year, and it's bigger than that now, but the main funding, or supplemental, how is it a trillion?
[02:09:30.518 --> 02:09:34.781]  Because they had all the pension funds and all the other savings and Pentagon investments of 50 years.
[02:09:36.161 --> 02:09:38.263]  50 plus years now, with almost 60 years.
[02:09:40.604 --> 02:09:42.926]  I mean, there's even investments that go back to the Department of War.
[02:09:44.982 --> 02:09:46.744]  So, they just sucked all that out.
[02:09:47.664 --> 02:09:49.626]  And they just come, sorry, our computers don't work.
[02:09:49.646 --> 02:09:50.326]  We don't know where it is.
[02:09:50.346 --> 02:09:50.987]  Can you imagine?
[02:09:51.447 --> 02:09:56.170]  You know, let's say with the income tax, they're arresting you or whatever for not paying it or taking you to jail, kangaroo court.
[02:09:56.771 --> 02:09:59.232]  You just say, oh, I never took records.
[02:09:59.272 --> 02:10:00.133]  My computer's broke.
[02:10:00.493 --> 02:10:01.274]  That's why I didn't pay.
[02:10:01.894 --> 02:10:07.058]  Or imagine if you robbed a bank electronically and then they came to come arrest you.
[02:10:07.098 --> 02:10:09.440]  You say, oh, this is a complete computer glitch.
[02:10:10.921 --> 02:10:11.401]  Trillions!
[02:10:11.441 --> 02:10:12.622]  You don't know them!
[02:10:13.365 --> 02:10:14.605]  We have those clips you can play on.
[02:10:14.625 --> 02:10:15.566]  It's like eight minutes long.
[02:10:15.586 --> 02:10:17.786]  We don't have that time to do it.
[02:10:17.806 --> 02:10:18.627]  We've played it many times.
[02:10:18.667 --> 02:10:24.128]  Just type in prisonplanet.com into Google and then add to it Rumsfeld Grilled.
[02:10:24.848 --> 02:10:26.589]  And that should bring it up for you, the video clip.
[02:10:27.809 --> 02:10:29.750]  But we're the Trillions.
[02:10:29.850 --> 02:10:30.150]  I don't know.
[02:10:30.170 --> 02:10:31.130]  We're not going to answer your question.
[02:10:31.530 --> 02:10:31.951]  Next year.
[02:10:31.971 --> 02:10:32.571]  We're the Trillions.
[02:10:32.591 --> 02:10:33.031]  I don't know.
[02:10:33.051 --> 02:10:34.051]  We're not going to answer the question.
[02:10:34.391 --> 02:10:35.432]  They don't even deny it.
[02:10:35.452 --> 02:10:36.512]  We're not going to answer your questions.
[02:10:37.771 --> 02:10:42.013]  You don't think they're really paying for $500 hammers and $1,000 toilet seats.
[02:10:42.033 --> 02:10:42.854]  That was back in the 80s.
[02:10:42.894 --> 02:10:43.454]  It's much worse now.
[02:10:43.474 --> 02:10:49.397]  You don't think they're really paying for a blue tarp, $50 million, as a building in Iraq.
[02:10:49.417 --> 02:10:49.697]  No, no.
[02:10:50.037 --> 02:10:52.418]  It isn't just going to black-off projects.
[02:10:54.699 --> 02:10:57.080]  It goes into their personal bank accounts.
[02:10:57.121 --> 02:11:01.383]  You know, you heard about the congressman getting arrested quietly for $800 million they get personally.
[02:11:01.403 --> 02:11:02.943]  $800 million?
[02:11:03.864 --> 02:11:05.985]  Just being sent to post office boxes.
[02:11:10.979 --> 02:11:13.381]  It's just a ravenous... Criminals always do this.
[02:11:13.401 --> 02:11:14.061]  They get away with it.
[02:11:14.081 --> 02:11:14.642]  They get away with it.
[02:11:14.662 --> 02:11:15.222]  They get away with it.
[02:11:15.442 --> 02:11:16.023]  They get away with it.
[02:11:16.343 --> 02:11:24.509]  Serial killers always, when they get caught, go, I'd already killed 50 women or 35 people, and then I just started wanting to get caught.
[02:11:24.569 --> 02:11:27.652]  I'd stab them right behind the grocery store and run.
[02:11:27.672 --> 02:11:29.613]  I'd videotape them.
[02:11:29.693 --> 02:11:30.193]  I don't know.
[02:11:30.214 --> 02:11:31.154]  They were so dumb.
[02:11:32.035 --> 02:11:36.018]  I started sending notes into the police department going, nanny, nanny, boo-boo.
[02:11:37.459 --> 02:11:38.580]  Aren't you going to catch me?
[02:11:39.639 --> 02:11:40.419]  And that's all they do.
[02:11:40.439 --> 02:12:01.591]  They're just running around frothing, stealing, signing bills that don't exist, saying they'll enforce laws that don't exist, running around arresting reporters that expose them, openly running white slavery rings, publicly Chicago Tribune, major associated press, BBC, naming names where they're being flown, huge slave brothels, nothing being done.
[02:12:06.774 --> 02:12:07.434]  Just crooks.
[02:12:10.896 --> 02:12:13.180]  Democrats stealing, Republicans stealing.
[02:12:15.103 --> 02:12:16.224]  Total criminality.
[02:12:16.284 --> 02:12:17.566]  Just insane.
[02:12:17.586 --> 02:12:23.455]  And now they're acting like they know the country's going to fail, going to fall, going to fall apart.
[02:12:23.475 --> 02:12:25.739]  Because now, before they were kind of, you know...
[02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:30.741]  Just stealing out of the back room, still acting a little bit sneaky about it, trying to be covert.
[02:12:30.781 --> 02:12:40.824]  Now they're just right out in front of us, just grabbing the chandeliers off, pulling the golden sinks out, just pulling off the wood paneling right in front of us, saying, Shut up or terrorists will get you!
[02:12:42.165 --> 02:12:43.885]  Men, wear black masks to scare them.
[02:12:43.905 --> 02:12:45.265]  Stand over there with guns aimed at them.
[02:12:45.285 --> 02:12:46.206]  Tell them not to protest.
[02:12:46.286 --> 02:12:47.186]  Oh, give me the goods!
[02:12:47.206 --> 02:12:47.906]  Give me the goods!
[02:12:48.366 --> 02:12:49.086]  Oh, this is mine!
[02:12:49.106 --> 02:12:49.627]  This is mine!
[02:12:49.907 --> 02:12:50.327]  Oh, get it!
[02:12:50.627 --> 02:12:51.067]  Oh, yeah!
[02:12:51.467 --> 02:12:53.348]  Oh, just print even more Federal Reserve notes.
[02:12:53.488 --> 02:12:54.228]  Ah, how we love it!
[02:12:58.810 --> 02:13:00.431]  It's like we're all on the deck of the Titanic.
[02:13:00.471 --> 02:13:03.794]  You always hear the thing of the orchestra still playing and people polishing silverware.
[02:13:04.214 --> 02:13:05.315]  But it's worse than that.
[02:13:05.895 --> 02:13:13.100]  It's like we're all sitting on the deck of the Titanic and they're all busy loading the life rafts full of jewels and going, excuse me, can I have your wallet?
[02:13:13.140 --> 02:13:14.321]  And we're like, certainly.
[02:13:14.501 --> 02:13:15.682]  Can I have your watch, your wedding ring?
[02:13:15.722 --> 02:13:16.723]  Oh yes, here it is, government.
[02:13:17.323 --> 02:13:32.276]  And the government's like, now you guys all just stay right there and enjoy the rest of the band playing, and they're all jumping on lifeboats and lowering themselves down, and the ship's starting to keen 90 degrees, and people are falling out of their chairs and bouncing off the railings, and they're going, it's okay, it's okay, everything's normal.
[02:13:38.402 --> 02:13:42.986]  I mean, the verifiable admitted looting at every level.
[02:13:44.651 --> 02:13:48.714]  Do you understand with these toll road deals in Texas being given to the foreign Spanish company?
[02:13:49.235 --> 02:13:51.537]  And there's Dutch and Germans and French and British.
[02:13:51.597 --> 02:13:52.898]  They're getting everything.
[02:13:54.078 --> 02:13:59.082]  The government pays them to take the roads and be paid billions.
[02:14:00.383 --> 02:14:01.444]  You talk about sweetheart deals.
[02:14:01.464 --> 02:14:09.410]  It'd be like if it was a scam and you went to the car dealership and you really got a deal with the guy at the car dealership who supposedly owns it.
[02:14:09.430 --> 02:14:12.553]  He's planning to blow the company out like the mafia does.
[02:14:13.886 --> 02:14:17.927]  And he pays you to take cars off of him.
[02:14:19.547 --> 02:14:20.868]  But really, the cars are going to him.
[02:14:21.428 --> 02:14:23.909]  Imagine, oh, you want this new $30,000 minivan?
[02:14:24.689 --> 02:14:28.050]  Sure, I'll pay you $10,000 to take it off my hands.
[02:14:30.690 --> 02:14:31.831]  And that's what the toll roads are.
[02:14:32.111 --> 02:14:38.352]  We're going to pay you to run these roads and let you collect the money and keep all of it.
[02:14:38.972 --> 02:14:41.213]  All you have to do is pay for upkeep of the roads.
[02:14:42.719 --> 02:14:43.739]  And then you read the contract.
[02:14:43.919 --> 02:14:52.263]  Upkeep simply means that they have to pay for the administrative cost of taking state gas tax money to build the roads.
[02:14:54.303 --> 02:14:57.805]  Imagine having a business like that where it's just all guaranteed.
[02:15:00.205 --> 02:15:02.666]  And who gets left with the short end of the stick?
[02:15:02.786 --> 02:15:02.926]  Us.
[02:15:04.947 --> 02:15:07.648]  Are you beginning to realize how massive this is?
[02:15:07.788 --> 02:15:09.869]  It is just wholesale.
[02:15:11.616 --> 02:15:12.897]  We pay for a water district.
[02:15:12.917 --> 02:15:14.317]  We pay for a water treatment plant.
[02:15:14.537 --> 02:15:18.119]  And then it's just given to the local water district that's foreign-owned.
[02:15:18.339 --> 02:15:21.601]  Just, oh, well, they've now taken over administrative proceedings.
[02:15:21.641 --> 02:15:23.822]  The county commissioner's court has voted to do that.
[02:15:24.482 --> 02:15:40.210]  And people go, wait a minute, but judge, chairman of the committee, chairman of the, your wife is an executive of this water district board, and she's paid $300,000 a year by this German company to sit on the local board as their administrator.
[02:15:41.019 --> 02:15:42.040]  Never mind that.
[02:15:44.061 --> 02:15:45.221]  Officer, remove him.
[02:15:46.102 --> 02:15:47.382]  And then now it just happens.
[02:15:47.903 --> 02:15:49.523]  The officer sits there and goes, that's right, get out of here.
[02:15:50.064 --> 02:15:51.765]  The way things are done.
[02:15:51.885 --> 02:15:54.026]  And you're being taken out by the officer out at the parking lot.
[02:15:54.046 --> 02:15:55.286]  Don't you know they're stealing?
[02:15:55.466 --> 02:15:57.647]  Shut up right now, or I'll have you arrested.
[02:15:57.667 --> 02:16:06.352]  It's boss hoggism gone to seed at light speed.
[02:16:06.452 --> 02:16:06.612]  Just...
[02:16:07.310 --> 02:16:15.253]  Total looting, total criminality, total insanity, total robbing, just total throat-slitting of America right in front of everybody.
[02:16:18.674 --> 02:16:20.715]  I mean, everybody freaks out about China censoring stuff.
[02:16:20.975 --> 02:16:29.479]  MySpace has erased a whole bunch of blogs that we and others had put up there with names like Will Rupert Murdoch shut down this site.
[02:16:29.939 --> 02:16:31.679]  Haven't shut down our main one we put up yet.
[02:16:32.140 --> 02:16:32.960]  We haven't really plugged it.
[02:16:33.620 --> 02:16:35.821]  I asked earlier, what's the name of our MySpace account?
[02:16:36.920 --> 02:16:40.221]  I saw them in their building yesterday and today, but we're just testing it.
[02:16:42.262 --> 02:16:44.363]  Our MySpace account is about exposing MySpace.
[02:16:44.723 --> 02:16:49.425]  They may be sophisticated enough to leave ours out knowing we're big and we'll send them traffic while cutting out all the little ones.
[02:16:50.325 --> 02:16:51.085]  We'll see what happens.
[02:16:52.386 --> 02:16:53.066]  I mean, they're not dumb.
[02:16:53.086 --> 02:16:53.906]  They know it's a trap.
[02:16:54.627 --> 02:16:56.287]  Because then we'll show what a bunch of censors they are.
[02:16:56.647 --> 02:16:58.308]  There's already legions and examples of that.
[02:17:00.329 --> 02:17:01.869]  Oh, man, we'll come back, I promise.
[02:17:02.390 --> 02:17:02.870]  And we'll go...
[02:17:04.710 --> 02:17:08.713]  We'll go right to Tim and Leo and Robert and Barron and Jeff and many others.
[02:17:09.853 --> 02:17:11.034]  And I'm not trying to be negative.
[02:17:11.074 --> 02:17:13.055]  You know, what if Alex gets a little overboard?
[02:17:13.195 --> 02:17:13.836]  It ain't that bad.
[02:17:13.896 --> 02:17:14.837]  Yeah, it's that bad.
[02:17:15.897 --> 02:17:16.237]  Okay?
[02:17:17.438 --> 02:17:18.679]  It's that bad and worse.
[02:17:21.241 --> 02:17:21.941]  A lot worse.
[02:17:23.702 --> 02:17:25.143]  A lot worse than you can imagine.
[02:17:26.984 --> 02:17:29.006]  Than I can even fathom or grasp.
[02:17:31.527 --> 02:17:32.568]  It's unspeakable.
[02:17:34.406 --> 02:17:39.671]  It is systematically, scientifically crafted and executed stealing and enslavement.
[02:17:39.951 --> 02:17:40.632]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:45.676 --> 02:17:46.717]  The war on terrorism.
[02:17:47.037 --> 02:17:49.819]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:17:50.100 --> 02:17:54.243]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:17:54.664 --> 02:17:55.504]  So what do you do?
[02:17:55.825 --> 02:18:00.409]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:18:00.889 --> 02:18:02.971]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:18:03.473 --> 02:18:18.176]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[02:19:44.951 --> 02:19:47.392]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:47.892 --> 02:19:54.694]  Did you know that one of the 45 objectives of international communism was to have America become involved in free trade?
[02:19:55.254 --> 02:20:05.158]  Without tariffs on cheaply produced foreign goods, our manufacturing base, which would not be able to compete, would be forced to move their manufacturing plants overseas or to Mexico.
[02:20:05.878 --> 02:20:12.040]  This would throw millions of workers out of work and completely destroy the middle class that has made America great.
[02:20:12.780 --> 02:20:20.644]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:20:48.966 --> 02:20:53.968]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[02:20:54.288 --> 02:21:02.189]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:21:02.349 --> 02:21:09.391]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:21:09.611 --> 02:21:10.832]  There are no side effects.
[02:21:10.972 --> 02:21:14.374]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:21:14.434 --> 02:21:15.554]  Don't just treat symptoms.

[02:21:29.901 --> 02:21:30.861]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:21:30.881 --> 02:21:31.961]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:21:32.001 --> 02:21:33.842]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:55.890 --> 02:22:03.444]  All right, I, uh... I didn't finish up with them.
[02:22:05.027 --> 02:22:05.828]  Two billion extra...
[02:22:06.969 --> 02:22:07.549]  Alex, long time.
[02:22:07.609 --> 02:22:11.431]  I was wondering if you were following this story out of Florida, this Martin Anderson.
[02:22:36.698 --> 02:22:39.581]  14-year-old kid was... Yeah, I've seen the video.
[02:22:39.601 --> 02:22:40.642]  You've seen the video?
[02:22:40.842 --> 02:22:54.975]  They stomped him and tortured him to death, and then clearly he was dead on the video, and then they show him, and they say, oh, he died of a blood disorder, and then they had a real autopsy done, and lo and behold, they killed him, and nothing's going to happen because you're allowed to murder children.
[02:22:55.035 --> 02:22:55.656]  It's called tyranny.
[02:22:56.872 --> 02:22:57.592]  Unbelievable.
[02:22:57.672 --> 02:23:10.839]  Yeah, you know, the government ships in the drugs and sets up the society where the kids are bad and tells the parents not to discipline, and they get in trouble, they get sent to these camps, and a bunch of other kids have died at that camp in Florida, and a bunch more are going to die.
[02:23:11.179 --> 02:23:15.822]  They'll probably start beating their brains out on national TV, and then they'll say a little birdie did it.
[02:23:16.082 --> 02:23:18.423]  They won't say the hickory sticks did it.
[02:23:19.063 --> 02:23:27.308]  They'll probably beat their heads off with Louisville Sluggers until there's not even a head left, just a sack of flesh, and say that they've given them more life.
[02:23:27.708 --> 02:23:37.534]  The Miami Herald had an interesting comment from a doctor that said it was not a common occurrence and in his 40 years he'd ever saw any two autopsies in the same place.
[02:23:38.413 --> 02:23:48.118]  Well, they had the local creature said that he died of a blood disorder, and then they took it to an independent, and he said, no, I've been beaten to death.
[02:23:48.899 --> 02:23:51.200]  You can see them kill him on the videotape.
[02:23:51.460 --> 02:23:55.362]  Bunch of punks with a tied-down little kid stomping on them because they're not real men.
[02:23:55.862 --> 02:23:59.504]  They like to beat people up because they're deranged lunatics.
[02:24:01.383 --> 02:24:02.163]  Well, thanks for the time.
[02:24:02.183 --> 02:24:06.005]  Can I end with just one quick piece of a quote from Dresden James that sums it all up here?
[02:24:06.065 --> 02:24:06.205]  Sure.
[02:24:06.225 --> 02:24:17.250]  When a well-packaged web of lies has been sold gradually to the masses over generations, the truth will seem utterly preposterous and its speaker a raving lunatic.
[02:24:18.411 --> 02:24:19.411]  That's a nice quote.
[02:24:20.892 --> 02:24:21.592]  Thank you for the call.
[02:24:21.652 --> 02:24:22.172]  I appreciate it.
[02:24:22.192 --> 02:24:24.654]  Yeah, I meant to talk about that so many days in the last few months.
[02:24:24.694 --> 02:24:25.454]  I've had those articles.
[02:24:25.514 --> 02:24:26.354]  I've watched that video.
[02:24:26.374 --> 02:24:28.215]  In fact, it's in the stack today.
[02:24:28.235 --> 02:24:30.016]  New developments on the autopsies.
[02:24:30.876 --> 02:24:37.440]  And I don't even... I mean, number one, I don't want to think that those jail guards were that stupid.
[02:24:38.480 --> 02:24:40.961]  People running the camp were that dumb to know.
[02:24:41.502 --> 02:24:46.164]  But I know a lot of adults that think WWF wrestling is real or WWE, whatever it's called today.
[02:24:46.644 --> 02:24:51.447]  You don't stomp on people's heads and they not go into comas or die or be in deep trouble.
[02:24:52.207 --> 02:24:57.070]  Believe me, folks, I've been stomped in the head and couldn't get out of bed for three days and seeing spots.
[02:24:57.670 --> 02:24:58.631]  I've had my leg broken.
[02:24:59.685 --> 02:25:01.025]  And I've put people in comas.
[02:25:01.946 --> 02:25:04.826]  And I can't believe how many fights I got.
[02:25:04.886 --> 02:25:05.626]  And it was insane.
[02:25:05.666 --> 02:25:06.547]  And I'm an idiot.
[02:25:06.567 --> 02:25:08.947]  I mean, I liked fighting.
[02:25:08.987 --> 02:25:10.307]  I liked fighting big, tough guys.
[02:25:10.347 --> 02:25:12.048]  I liked fighting multiple people growing up.
[02:25:13.108 --> 02:25:14.328]  And up in Dallas.
[02:25:14.468 --> 02:25:15.849]  And I'm just lucky to be alive.
[02:25:16.449 --> 02:25:18.689]  And just the average man has never been in real fights.
[02:25:18.709 --> 02:25:19.309]  And he doesn't know.
[02:25:19.730 --> 02:25:22.330]  So these stupid people that want to be tough go be jail guards.
[02:25:22.690 --> 02:25:23.790]  And they beat up little kids.
[02:25:23.830 --> 02:25:25.711]  I mean, you can't stomp on people.
[02:25:25.771 --> 02:25:26.271]  It kills them.
[02:25:28.039 --> 02:25:34.532]  I mean, a lot of times, if you're a big, strong man, you punch somebody four or five times in the head, they're going to be out for a long time.
[02:25:36.456 --> 02:25:38.620]  I mean, I've had somebody put the boots to me.
[02:25:38.700 --> 02:25:39.302]  It's not fun.
[02:25:40.816 --> 02:25:41.937]  And I put the boots to people.
[02:25:42.017 --> 02:25:56.804]  One time, I just had my leg broken in a fight, and I was at some party, and some big ex-convict had gotten out, so I was hanging out with rough people, came in and pulled the knives, and I was so scared, because my leg was barely mended, I could hardly walk, that I put him down as fast as I could.
[02:25:57.104 --> 02:25:57.865]  Huge guy.
[02:25:58.345 --> 02:26:00.546]  And that guy had kidney failure, coma.
[02:26:01.126 --> 02:26:05.028]  I mean, he looked like, because once I got him down, he was so big, I put the boots to him.
[02:26:05.743 --> 02:26:08.906]  And I'd had the boots put to me before, and I knew that I wasn't 100%.
[02:26:09.526 --> 02:26:10.147]  I wasn't 50%.
[02:26:11.628 --> 02:26:12.689]  And these people don't know that.
[02:26:12.729 --> 02:26:17.513]  I mean, I see these cock videos where they're stomping on somebody and punching them and slamming them around.
[02:26:17.733 --> 02:26:19.054]  People die all the time.
[02:26:19.315 --> 02:26:19.875]  You idiots!
[02:26:20.135 --> 02:26:24.379]  It isn't like wrestling where you can pile drive people and punch them 55 times.
[02:26:24.619 --> 02:26:27.662]  If Hulk Hogan really hit somebody four times, they'd probably be dead.
[02:26:27.682 --> 02:26:33.867]  You know, if Mike Tyson, when he was in the ring in that stupid pro wrestling, punching people 50 times, they'd be dead.
[02:26:35.635 --> 02:26:37.336]  But we don't have real men in this country.
[02:26:38.877 --> 02:26:42.040]  We don't have men who have ever really been in fights anymore in most areas of this nation.
[02:26:42.060 --> 02:26:42.940]  They have no idea.
[02:26:46.503 --> 02:26:50.906]  The last three fights I got in, people were out for days.
[02:26:52.447 --> 02:26:56.090]  That's why I don't like fighting.
[02:26:56.110 --> 02:26:58.011]  I won't get in fights because you will kill people.
[02:26:59.893 --> 02:27:01.914]  Most people hold back when they get in a fight.
[02:27:02.154 --> 02:27:04.496]  But if you don't hold back, you will kill people.
[02:27:05.956 --> 02:27:10.280]  You've got these big men with this tied-down little black boy beating him to death.
[02:27:10.680 --> 02:27:12.121]  What did you think was going to happen?
[02:27:12.321 --> 02:27:15.944]  And then you've got a medical examiner that will certify that you didn't murder him.
[02:27:17.966 --> 02:27:21.249]  They need to be convicted, and they need to have the boots put to them.
[02:27:22.610 --> 02:27:23.310]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:23.330 --> 02:27:23.791]  Stay with us.
[02:27:34.102 --> 02:27:35.022]  We're on the march.
[02:27:35.482 --> 02:27:37.103]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.003 --> 02:27:40.784]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:27:57.167 --> 02:28:00.648]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[02:28:00.928 --> 02:28:01.388]  We're good to go.
[02:28:22.057 --> 02:28:28.984]  The Berkey light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[02:28:29.205 --> 02:28:31.868]  Get the Berkey light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:28:34.510 --> 02:28:35.792]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:28:44.821 --> 02:28:47.383]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:28:47.543 --> 02:28:49.705]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:28:49.985 --> 02:29:00.074]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[02:29:00.394 --> 02:29:02.736]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.

[02:29:33.242 --> 02:29:35.225]  That's 1-800-340-7091 or on the web at CalvinPureSoap.com.
[02:29:43.504 --> 02:29:47.949]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[02:29:48.229 --> 02:29:51.813]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[02:29:51.953 --> 02:30:00.081]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[02:30:00.341 --> 02:30:05.967]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[02:30:06.267 --> 02:30:11.509]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[02:30:11.770 --> 02:30:13.870]  This is why you need the FilterMag.
[02:30:14.111 --> 02:30:26.276]  The FilterMag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[02:30:26.516 --> 02:30:30.917]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installed in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[02:30:31.137 --> 02:30:32.098]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:30:32.278 --> 02:30:33.898]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[02:30:34.018 --> 02:30:35.279]  That's FilterMag.com.
[02:30:35.299 --> 02:30:35.819]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[02:30:35.959 --> 02:30:36.259]  That's 800-345-8376.
[02:30:36.319 --> 02:30:38.940]  All right, let's go back to your calls without a loss of a minute.
[02:30:51.347 --> 02:30:52.507]  Leo in California.
[02:30:52.527 --> 02:30:53.088]  You're on the air.
[02:30:53.108 --> 02:30:53.548]  Go ahead.
[02:30:53.568 --> 02:30:54.248]  Hello, Alex.
[02:30:54.748 --> 02:30:54.968]  Hi.
[02:30:55.508 --> 02:30:55.868]  How you doing?
[02:30:55.908 --> 02:30:58.249]  I just wanted to say that last segment, you are right about that.
[02:30:58.689 --> 02:31:03.511]  I have been witness to many types of police brutality here.
[02:31:03.531 --> 02:31:09.792]  Like, for instance, my uncle, my girlfriend's uncle was a jail guard, and he got arrested, and they're all being charged for murder.
[02:31:09.812 --> 02:31:10.793]  Three people were involved.
[02:31:11.233 --> 02:31:11.833]  Actually, four.
[02:31:11.853 --> 02:31:13.493]  The other one's getting charged with assault.
[02:31:14.214 --> 02:31:15.494]  But I guess they kicked the guy's head.
[02:31:16.209 --> 02:31:17.890]  And he ended up dying in the hospital.
[02:31:17.950 --> 02:31:19.811]  It's because a lot of them have never really done it.
[02:31:19.831 --> 02:31:20.351]  They don't know.
[02:31:20.751 --> 02:31:23.872]  Yeah, and I've seen many other instances where this has happened.
[02:31:23.892 --> 02:31:26.333]  I'm here to actually talk about Myspace.
[02:31:26.373 --> 02:31:27.314]  I just caught my attention.
[02:31:27.914 --> 02:31:28.274]  Okay.
[02:31:28.794 --> 02:31:34.577]  Actually, I just wanted to say that about a week and a half ago, I set up a Myspace account, anti-New World Order profile.
[02:31:35.277 --> 02:31:37.918]  And it's been getting a lot of hits and doing pretty well.
[02:31:38.118 --> 02:31:44.081]  And I have noticed quite a few other people on there have Myspace profiles geared against New World Order and
[02:31:44.815 --> 02:31:48.858]  And I'm not sure what kind of censorship they've had happen to them.
[02:31:48.938 --> 02:31:50.619]  I've seen some censorship myself.
[02:31:51.099 --> 02:31:53.701]  Well, I mean, it's been in the establishment media.
[02:31:53.741 --> 02:31:56.622]  They have these spiders, computer term.
[02:31:56.822 --> 02:32:01.065]  It goes out and looks for keywords and just won't let you enter certain words.
[02:32:01.365 --> 02:32:04.047]  I noticed that some links have been erased.
[02:32:04.147 --> 02:32:07.769]  Actually, this morning I was posting your article about the MySpace censorship.
[02:32:08.410 --> 02:32:13.433]  I joined about 20 groups in about 20 minutes and just posting it big time.
[02:32:13.633 --> 02:32:13.713]  And...
[02:32:14.525 --> 02:32:21.331]  Right after that, I couldn't log into my account, and I kept getting run-time error messages, and I still can't log into my account.
[02:32:21.992 --> 02:32:33.902]  Yeah, we need everybody to email ryan at infowars.com, kevin at infowars.com, because part two of the story, of course, will be all the sites that are now getting taken down or kicked off.
[02:32:35.193 --> 02:32:36.634]  And then we're supposed to self-censure.
[02:32:36.714 --> 02:32:38.094]  Oh, let me keep mine.
[02:32:38.274 --> 02:32:39.215]  I'll be good.
[02:32:39.315 --> 02:32:46.258]  I also noticed they had a double standard on there about censorship because I noticed they did have a group that was a pretty big anti-Bush group that had like 4,000 members.
[02:32:46.278 --> 02:32:46.578]  They got...
[02:32:47.302 --> 02:32:51.003]  It's gone now, and most groups that do get that big get erased pretty quick.
[02:32:51.243 --> 02:32:52.263]  Yeah, no, that's what it's about.
[02:32:52.323 --> 02:32:56.044]  You send them traffic, you give them attention, and they cut you off.
[02:32:56.444 --> 02:32:59.885]  Why would you want to have a site in a place where you don't control your content?
[02:33:00.386 --> 02:33:02.086]  Well, they've made it easy.
[02:33:02.106 --> 02:33:12.029]  Well, what's going to happen is, it's already happened, other people are going to start other free sites where there aren't as many people, but there'll be a lot of people, and where it will still be free, and then those will get bought up once they get big.
[02:33:12.049 --> 02:33:16.710]  Well, I've noticed two more things about their... My first order of business on MySpace was to go to the group bulletins and post...
[02:33:17.774 --> 02:33:18.475]  Various articles.
[02:33:18.675 --> 02:33:24.859]  The first thing I did was join some parents groups, and I posted vaccine articles about the dangers of vaccines.
[02:33:24.919 --> 02:33:29.241]  I ended up getting death threats from people, and all kinds of stuff happened with that.
[02:33:30.382 --> 02:33:32.303]  Some people backed me up, but most were pretty rude.
[02:33:32.884 --> 02:33:41.449]  I also posted up some military videos showing Iraqi troops or American troops engaging in some psychotic behavior, like blowing stuff up and laughing.
[02:33:41.469 --> 02:33:43.871]  I guess the trophy videos, of course, you have them on Prison Planet.
[02:33:43.891 --> 02:33:44.451]  That's where I got them.
[02:33:45.285 --> 02:33:52.327]  And I got quite a few hits on that, and a lot of death threats and military people just abusing me verbally, which doesn't really bother me.
[02:33:52.387 --> 02:33:53.248]  It shows their ignorance.
[02:33:53.268 --> 02:34:00.050]  But at the same time, I don't see MySpace doing anything to stop them sending death threats and all that stuff.
[02:34:00.110 --> 02:34:01.490]  No, that's what it is.
[02:34:01.571 --> 02:34:06.992]  I mean, Murdoch buys it, and then it was $680 million he bought it for or something.
[02:34:07.493 --> 02:34:08.773]  I said less yesterday, but...
[02:34:09.508 --> 02:34:10.729]  No, it was $580 million.
[02:34:10.749 --> 02:34:11.969]  There, I got it right the fifth time.
[02:34:12.929 --> 02:34:17.211]  I said $560-something million yesterday, but I actually looked it up this morning when we wrote an article about it.
[02:34:17.911 --> 02:34:21.873]  But again, everybody's like, MySpace, MySpace, MySpace.
[02:34:21.913 --> 02:34:22.953]  Okay, we've put one up.
[02:34:22.993 --> 02:34:24.834]  We've even put a muscle picture of myself up there.
[02:34:24.854 --> 02:34:28.135]  Trying to go with the whole MySpace idea.
[02:34:28.155 --> 02:34:30.636]  I keep forgetting.
[02:34:30.656 --> 02:34:33.457]  My laptop won't get online now here in this office for some reason.
[02:34:33.757 --> 02:34:35.218]  Does that give you mine so you can give me yours?
[02:34:36.732 --> 02:34:37.212]  Yeah, sure.
[02:34:37.232 --> 02:34:46.642]  We just put up one, and I keep asking them to come in and tell me, and maybe they're not listening or they're forgetting or there's too much fun going on there in the back for people to hear me.
[02:34:46.682 --> 02:34:50.706]  But, sure, give us your MySpace account.
[02:34:50.866 --> 02:34:55.611]  Yeah, it's just www.myspace.com forward slash fight NWO.
[02:34:56.920 --> 02:34:57.120]  Good.
[02:34:57.160 --> 02:35:01.803]  Everybody send us your MySpace accounts, and we'd like to link to them and talk about them.
[02:35:01.963 --> 02:35:04.205]  One more quick thing.
[02:35:04.265 --> 02:35:05.806]  Let me just finish.
[02:35:05.846 --> 02:35:07.147]  Talk about the experiment we're doing.
[02:35:07.447 --> 02:35:07.787]  Go ahead.
[02:35:08.728 --> 02:35:11.169]  I just wanted to say if you caught Coast to Coast last night.
[02:35:11.770 --> 02:35:12.190]  No, I didn't.
[02:35:12.470 --> 02:35:13.231]  I was just really excited.
[02:35:13.271 --> 02:35:14.932]  He had Catherine Albright on there.
[02:35:15.272 --> 02:35:20.235]  I guess he's getting pretty big into the microchip stories lately, so I was just excited.
[02:35:20.255 --> 02:35:21.036]  I just wanted to mention that.
[02:35:21.296 --> 02:35:22.057]  Yeah, the spy chips.
[02:35:22.097 --> 02:35:22.417]  Thank you.
[02:35:23.598 --> 02:35:23.978]  Appreciate it.
[02:35:23.998 --> 02:35:25.458]  I'm going to take a few more calls here now.
[02:35:25.478 --> 02:35:33.900]  To try to restate what I was saying, send us your emails with your MySpace account or any of your comments or your experiences or any screenshots or any proof of what's happened to you.
[02:35:34.420 --> 02:35:36.140]  Let's say they shut your site down and erase it.
[02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:41.741]  You can go to Google Cash usually and find your site saved and send us a link to that and what happened to you.
[02:35:42.341 --> 02:35:42.922]  Tell us about it.
[02:35:42.942 --> 02:35:49.983]  We're going to kind of create an area on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com showing the things that MySpace does.
[02:35:51.508 --> 02:35:56.150]  When we have their admissions, they do it, but we want to really demonstrate it.
[02:35:57.590 --> 02:35:59.071]  We want to demonstrate what it is.
[02:35:59.231 --> 02:36:00.632]  We've got a big article out today.
[02:36:01.092 --> 02:36:03.573]  MySpace is the Trojan horse of Internet censorship.
[02:36:05.253 --> 02:36:14.237]  Media elites' last gasp effort to save their empire that is beginning to crumble.
[02:36:15.677 --> 02:36:17.618]  So that is up there on the site.
[02:36:20.260 --> 02:36:22.441]  And Kevin just ran here and gave me this.
[02:36:22.481 --> 02:36:22.821]  What is it?
[02:36:23.361 --> 02:36:26.743]  MySpace at Alex underscore InfoWarrior?
[02:36:28.324 --> 02:36:31.005]  Okay, well, can we get a link up on InfoWars.com about that?
[02:36:33.926 --> 02:36:40.129]  Okay, and send any censorship articles to MySpace at InfoWars.com.
[02:36:41.649 --> 02:36:44.131]  We're starting a little research project here.
[02:36:45.531 --> 02:36:47.152]  Last night we launched a MySpace...
[02:36:47.956 --> 02:36:48.597]  So there you go.
[02:36:48.637 --> 02:36:49.237]  Thank you guys.
[02:36:49.337 --> 02:36:50.018]  I appreciate that.
[02:36:50.058 --> 02:36:52.599]  Let me now go ahead here and go to...
[02:37:17.561 --> 02:37:18.282]  San Diego.
[02:37:18.362 --> 02:37:19.363]  Robert in San Diego.
[02:37:19.403 --> 02:37:19.803]  Go ahead.
[02:37:20.384 --> 02:37:20.804]  Hi, Alex.
[02:37:21.385 --> 02:37:21.765]  Hello.
[02:37:22.085 --> 02:37:25.828]  I've called several times and I'm just monitoring the news.
[02:37:25.848 --> 02:37:27.210]  A little nervous, sorry.
[02:37:28.791 --> 02:37:31.674]  About the DU fallout and Halliburton taking over.
[02:37:32.114 --> 02:37:40.902]  Yeah, Halliburton goes in and takes over the radiation sensing services, but still their employees are leaking that the radiation's eight times safe levels.
[02:37:41.322 --> 02:37:43.464]  Yeah, and I wanted to talk about the new cover story because
[02:37:43.783 --> 02:37:50.005]  Since you mentioned that, they changed their story saying that secondhand smoke was giving all these people cancer.
[02:37:50.325 --> 02:37:57.127]  And now right here on the top Google search for the top 12 stories is radon is the leading cause of lung cancer in non-smokers.
[02:37:57.647 --> 02:38:00.268]  Oh, suddenly radon gas is killing us.
[02:38:00.448 --> 02:38:07.650]  In the last three days, I've seen 10 PSAs, both on radio and TV, about how radon, check for radon because now it's going to get you all.
[02:38:08.030 --> 02:38:11.111]  Because they're trying to make that the reason why Dana Reeves died.
[02:38:16.421 --> 02:38:17.922]  Well, that's what the NSA does.
[02:38:17.942 --> 02:38:21.063]  See, more than spying on people individually, it picks up trends.
[02:38:21.103 --> 02:38:24.946]  Hey, they're waking up the cancers up by thousands of percentiles, 500%, now 200% over that.
[02:38:24.966 --> 02:38:25.546]  That's thousands, folks.
[02:38:27.467 --> 02:38:28.908]  Oh my gosh, everybody's getting it.
[02:38:28.928 --> 02:38:29.869]  Little kids are getting it.
[02:38:30.389 --> 02:38:36.434]  It's the DU and other toxins and other radiation particles and poisons and other things.
[02:38:36.734 --> 02:38:44.100]  Okay, okay, suddenly start saying it's radon and it's secondhand smoke and it's all these things because this is a scandal, folks.
[02:38:45.761 --> 02:38:46.302]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:38:46.795 --> 02:38:56.000]  No, I was just going to credit you, because it was only days after that you had mentioned that Halliburton had taken it over, and suddenly now there's no bad DU falling out all over everybody.
[02:38:56.300 --> 02:38:58.662]  Suddenly now, hey, watch out for radon, it's going to get you.
[02:38:58.702 --> 02:39:01.383]  We never knew this before, but gosh, there's just radon everywhere.
[02:39:01.403 --> 02:39:03.425]  It's so obvious.
[02:39:04.045 --> 02:39:09.248]  Yeah, I mean, if you have a house that's built on the bedrock near high radon levels,
[02:39:10.244 --> 02:39:14.268]  And they're coming out with that new movie, Thanks for Smoking.
[02:39:37.304 --> 02:39:38.265]  Have you seen the ads on that?
[02:39:38.446 --> 02:39:39.567]  Yes, it's all the cigarettes.
[02:39:39.607 --> 02:39:41.550]  I mean, that's just, what great timing, huh?
[02:39:41.610 --> 02:39:43.252]  And they tie cigarettes in with guns.
[02:39:43.613 --> 02:39:45.996]  It's just, thanks for all you do, Alex.
[02:39:46.597 --> 02:39:47.298]  I appreciate it.
[02:39:48.960 --> 02:39:51.444]  Yeah, I guess a lot of us are going to be dying of lung cancer.
[02:39:52.737 --> 02:39:56.158]  People never smoke, people never worked in mines, never worked in factories.
[02:39:56.598 --> 02:39:58.339]  Just go, you're 25, you've got lung cancer.
[02:39:58.499 --> 02:40:00.460]  Oh, somebody else in your class has got it.
[02:40:00.540 --> 02:40:01.400]  It's radon.
[02:40:01.760 --> 02:40:03.761]  They'll put detectors in and act all scared.
[02:40:03.821 --> 02:40:04.861]  Radon, radon, radon.
[02:40:05.081 --> 02:40:07.802]  And no one will go, wait a minute, radon levels aren't any higher than they were.
[02:40:08.703 --> 02:40:09.123]  What is?
[02:40:09.203 --> 02:40:09.903]  ODU?
[02:40:09.943 --> 02:40:12.164]  Does just a few particles of it cause lung cancer?
[02:40:12.204 --> 02:40:12.544]  Yes.
[02:40:14.060 --> 02:40:15.281]  Oh, well, that's not it.
[02:40:15.461 --> 02:40:19.083]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:40:19.603 --> 02:40:21.184]  See, that's why the globalists are crazy.
[02:40:21.384 --> 02:40:30.188]  Their own handbooks, their own military training manuals, their own mining association documents from the 80s, all the science says, total cancer-causing agent.
[02:40:30.228 --> 02:40:32.109]  It just sits there radiating your cells.
[02:40:32.549 --> 02:40:38.432]  It stays right up against the cells, destroying the nuclei, gives you lung cancer like nothing else.
[02:40:39.787 --> 02:40:40.468]  I mean, it is.
[02:40:41.409 --> 02:40:44.011]  If they bottled the stuff, it'd be called lung cancer in a bottle.
[02:40:46.474 --> 02:40:47.515]  And it doesn't matter.
[02:40:48.195 --> 02:40:48.796]  I'm breathing it.
[02:40:48.836 --> 02:40:49.777]  My children are breathing it.
[02:40:49.837 --> 02:40:50.438]  You're breathing it.
[02:40:50.498 --> 02:40:51.419]  Cops, you're breathing it.
[02:40:51.699 --> 02:40:53.040]  You're all breathing it.
[02:40:53.080 --> 02:40:54.762]  We're all, oh, thank you, New World Order.
[02:40:54.842 --> 02:40:56.303]  Oh, use it on Iran.
[02:40:56.464 --> 02:40:57.004]  Use more.
[02:40:57.405 --> 02:40:59.407]  Use it at ten proving grounds in America.
[02:40:59.867 --> 02:41:01.609]  Use it wherever you want.
[02:41:04.344 --> 02:41:05.285]  They all breathe it, too.
[02:41:06.166 --> 02:41:06.926]  It's a death cult.
[02:41:07.206 --> 02:41:09.167]  Really, I made a film called The Order of Death proving that.
[02:41:09.247 --> 02:41:10.588]  It's a psycho death cult.
[02:41:10.928 --> 02:41:12.029]  These people are nuts.
[02:41:12.950 --> 02:41:13.610]  They're nuts.
[02:41:15.471 --> 02:41:16.492]  Barron in Indiana.
[02:41:16.532 --> 02:41:17.272]  Barron, go ahead.
[02:41:17.292 --> 02:41:20.774]  That was some great information by Dale earlier.
[02:41:20.794 --> 02:41:23.636]  I can understand why it was censored.
[02:41:25.297 --> 02:41:30.040]  Hey, listen, before you put your little stalking comment out, thanks for the call, okay?
[02:41:30.861 --> 02:41:31.541]  I appreciate it.
[02:41:32.592 --> 02:41:38.899]  I recognize that idiot's voice and I'm just not going to have people that lie about me and bear false witness on my show.
[02:41:38.919 --> 02:41:39.900]  Okay?
[02:41:41.222 --> 02:41:42.923]  Go back to your shipping container you live in.
[02:41:44.405 --> 02:41:46.627]  Now, let's go ahead and talk to...
[02:41:48.806 --> 02:41:49.647]  Jeff and Mass.
[02:41:49.707 --> 02:41:50.567]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[02:41:50.627 --> 02:41:51.067]  Go ahead.
[02:41:51.508 --> 02:41:51.568]  Hi.
[02:41:51.628 --> 02:41:52.348]  Yes, indeed.
[02:41:52.368 --> 02:41:58.411]  Now, as far as freedom of speech is concerned, there's a new movie coming out called V for Vendetta.
[02:41:58.851 --> 02:41:59.872]  What do you think of that movie?
[02:42:00.432 --> 02:42:06.675]  I haven't seen it, and a listener two weeks ago raised it, and so I researched it, and it looks pretty Illuminati-ish.
[02:42:08.456 --> 02:42:17.161]  It does glorify terror, and it shows the parliament getting blown up, and it tries to cast rebels as terrorists...
[02:42:17.893 --> 02:42:19.434]  You know, Alex, I agree with you 110%.
[02:42:19.674 --> 02:42:20.674]  And you know what?
[02:42:20.734 --> 02:42:28.939]  People are being conditioned that patriots, Christians, and people who just love freedom of speech are kooks, terrorists, right-wing, and should be pacified.
[02:42:48.107 --> 02:42:55.594]  And the only good people are people who keep their mouths shut, are sheeple, and do as they're told, and everything will be just well.
[02:42:55.934 --> 02:42:56.935]  That's very scary.
[02:42:57.075 --> 02:42:58.336]  I like my freedom of speech.
[02:42:59.217 --> 02:43:01.499]  I like being able to debate issues.
[02:43:02.520 --> 02:43:05.042]  As long as it's within reason, debating is great.
[02:43:05.782 --> 02:43:09.466]  As long as there's no cussing and stuff like that, that's all good.
[02:43:10.807 --> 02:43:12.428]  And that's the way it should be.
[02:43:13.069 --> 02:43:13.789]  We're losing that.
[02:43:14.190 --> 02:43:14.530]  You know what?
[02:43:15.425 --> 02:43:17.286]  The government should be afraid of its people.
[02:43:17.666 --> 02:43:19.507]  We should not be afraid of our own government.
[02:43:19.847 --> 02:43:20.948]  It's just that simple.
[02:43:22.389 --> 02:43:22.989]  I agree with you.
[02:43:23.049 --> 02:43:27.131]  What do you think about the clear evidence here that Bush signed a bill that hadn't even been passed?
[02:43:27.211 --> 02:43:31.233]  I mean, this just adds the cherry on top.
[02:43:31.934 --> 02:43:33.875]  You know, it's unconstitutional.
[02:43:34.135 --> 02:43:38.577]  And as a martial artist, I was listening to you talk about a guy getting stomped.
[02:43:39.117 --> 02:43:42.479]  Do people even realize that people can get killed getting stomped?
[02:43:42.559 --> 02:43:44.360]  If I hit a guy in the neck...
[02:43:45.014 --> 02:43:47.339]  That's almost death, basically.
[02:43:47.359 --> 02:43:50.286]  You know, people go to prison all the time at a bar.
[02:43:50.406 --> 02:43:52.892]  They haul off and punch somebody one time and they die.
[02:43:53.502 --> 02:43:53.902]  That's it.
[02:43:54.202 --> 02:44:04.428]  I mean, you can hit the biggest guy just right in the temple, and it's as thick as a potato chip there, and the edge of that bone sticks into arteries, and the brain fills up with blood and pressures it.
[02:44:04.548 --> 02:44:07.830]  It puts pressure on it with a subdermal hematoma, and they're dead.
[02:44:08.271 --> 02:44:09.671]  You're absolutely right.
[02:44:09.711 --> 02:44:13.253]  I mean, the human body is not something you want to fool around with.
[02:44:13.374 --> 02:44:19.717]  Even a kidney blow in boxing, you're not supposed to hit in the kidneys because that's your body's filters.
[02:44:19.977 --> 02:44:20.998]  You destroy those.
[02:44:21.434 --> 02:44:21.914]  That's it.
[02:44:22.054 --> 02:44:23.055]  It's just that simple.
[02:44:23.095 --> 02:44:26.277]  Yeah, and at that same facility, it was like, I got the article.
[02:44:26.297 --> 02:44:28.478]  There's only five kids they've killed in the last year or two.
[02:44:28.518 --> 02:44:29.358]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:44:29.638 --> 02:44:30.259]  Thanks for the call.
[02:44:30.279 --> 02:44:30.939]  They'll kill more.
[02:44:30.959 --> 02:44:31.860]  Thanks for the call.
[02:44:31.920 --> 02:44:33.360]  They'll just stomp little kids to death.
[02:44:33.941 --> 02:44:36.342]  They'll probably start doing it on TV and call it good.
[02:44:36.362 --> 02:44:37.903]  I mean, you know.
[02:44:37.923 --> 02:44:39.123]  I joked about that a few years ago.
[02:44:39.143 --> 02:44:42.185]  Now John Yoo, White House attorney, says they can torture kids in front of their parents.
[02:44:42.205 --> 02:44:44.166]  All right.
[02:44:44.806 --> 02:44:45.907]  Let me cover a few other issues.
[02:44:48.198 --> 02:44:53.220]  I said that I would do a review of Scanner Darkly, and I don't know how I do justice to it.
[02:44:56.441 --> 02:45:10.366]  It is Philip K. Dick science fiction, you know, phenomenons, really his autobiography about drug use and drug abuse and what it did to him and people around him, and, you know, why do we put people in prison?
[02:45:11.303 --> 02:45:21.227]  For something that really is something that's just chemical that they fell into that is something very addictive and just destructive.
[02:45:21.247 --> 02:45:22.088]  It is a disease.
[02:45:22.628 --> 02:45:24.729]  Humans have always had substance abuse problems.
[02:45:25.389 --> 02:45:35.934]  And by making it illegal, we actually put money into it and then actually empower the industry and then make it fashionable and connected to money and then make more people actually get on it.
[02:45:36.434 --> 02:45:40.036]  All the research and evidence and historical evidence
[02:45:43.128 --> 02:45:44.429]  But that's just the backdrop.
[02:45:45.510 --> 02:46:03.205]  A larger part of the backdrop is face scanning cameras, total surveillance, 20% of the public on this drug, and of course you learn that a private corporation working with the government, much like Halliburton and others, is actually creating the crisis.
[02:46:04.306 --> 02:46:05.767]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[02:46:06.868 --> 02:46:08.930]  And that terrorism is manufactured.
[02:46:10.044 --> 02:46:13.388]  And that there is an all-encompassing police state.
[02:46:15.850 --> 02:46:17.031]  Very revolutionary.
[02:46:18.132 --> 02:46:20.635]  And I know it's got Winona Ryder.
[02:46:23.658 --> 02:46:27.362]  It's got Woody Harrelson.
[02:46:27.422 --> 02:46:28.783]  It's got Keanu Reeves.
[02:46:28.863 --> 02:46:29.263]  It's got...
[02:46:31.878 --> 02:46:36.281]  Just a lot of other people, and their performances are just amazing.
[02:46:36.341 --> 02:46:37.582]  Then they rotoscoped it.
[02:46:37.923 --> 02:46:42.266]  This is unlike any rotoscoping you've ever seen, where they animate each frame.
[02:46:43.086 --> 02:46:47.470]  So it's real, but it's not, and it makes their performances even more powerful.
[02:46:49.091 --> 02:46:58.358]  The thing about this film, and I was there at this little sneak peek last night that I was invited to, and it was great to be there, invited by the director and others.
[02:46:59.557 --> 02:47:05.378]  It was great to be there and to see something new.
[02:47:05.398 --> 02:47:07.418]  I mean, that's what avant-garde means, is something new.
[02:47:08.659 --> 02:47:09.719]  More than just state-of-the-art.
[02:47:09.779 --> 02:47:12.539]  I mean, there's not a lot of things in this world that are new.
[02:47:12.559 --> 02:47:14.180]  You know, the old saying, nothing new under the sun.
[02:47:14.900 --> 02:47:15.580]  This is new.
[02:47:16.900 --> 02:47:18.340]  The style of rotoscoping is new.
[02:47:18.380 --> 02:47:23.401]  The acting, the style of the movie, the way it plays out, the way it exposes the New World Order.
[02:47:24.201 --> 02:47:28.262]  Little subtle things like the bad guy, you know, in the movies wearing an Illuminati t-shirt.
[02:47:31.216 --> 02:47:35.297]  It's just, I'm so proud to be associated and to be involved with this film.
[02:47:36.758 --> 02:47:38.258]  I'm extremely proud of it.
[02:47:38.278 --> 02:47:50.922]  You know, I consulted on the film for some of the high-tech police state gadgetry, and kind of a look of the future, and I consulted in a moderate way, not in a huge way.
[02:47:50.962 --> 02:47:55.103]  I'm very impressed by the research that was done, because Dick wrote this back in the 70s,
[02:47:58.411 --> 02:48:05.096]  And I'm really impressed by his foresight of what was coming, what would develop, and the levels of control.
[02:48:05.397 --> 02:48:07.178]  And then, of course, I appear in the film.
[02:48:09.039 --> 02:48:10.641]  And I appear prominently in the film.
[02:48:10.721 --> 02:48:15.745]  I'm going to appear even more prominently in the DVD, which DVD is now bigger than theatrical releases.
[02:48:16.585 --> 02:48:17.746]  So that'll be exciting, too.
[02:48:17.826 --> 02:48:21.069]  But a couple of scenes that have me in them that you won't see in the film.
[02:48:21.990 --> 02:48:25.853]  You will see scenes I'm in in the film, but you'll see even more on the DVD.
[02:48:25.893 --> 02:48:27.334]  And that'll be hitting theaters in July.
[02:48:28.533 --> 02:48:30.535]  So we're excited about it, scanner darkly.
[02:48:30.956 --> 02:48:35.261]  I had all the stuff I wanted to say before the show, but I've kind of run my course already.
[02:48:35.281 --> 02:48:36.322]  I'm a little bit tired today.
[02:48:37.063 --> 02:48:38.184]  Come back with the final segment.
[02:48:38.204 --> 02:48:39.586]  Stay with me.
[02:48:43.988 --> 02:48:45.490]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:45.670 --> 02:48:48.753]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:48.893 --> 02:48:52.796]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:52.837 --> 02:48:57.061]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:48:57.441 --> 02:49:01.204]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:01.345 --> 02:49:03.186]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:03.326 --> 02:49:06.670]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[02:49:06.710 --> 02:49:07.771]  The medical bills...
[02:49:08.611 --> 02:49:11.393]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:11.553 --> 02:49:14.595]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[02:49:14.755 --> 02:49:17.636]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:18.116 --> 02:49:24.240]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:24.760 --> 02:49:25.281]  We're good to go.
[02:49:43.542 --> 02:49:49.764]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:49:49.924 --> 02:49:56.087]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:49:56.367 --> 02:50:04.790]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:50:05.050 --> 02:50:12.053]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:50:12.373 --> 02:50:17.196]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:50:17.396 --> 02:50:22.800]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:50:23.140 --> 02:50:26.222]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:50:26.563 --> 02:50:34.528]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:34.568 --> 02:50:35.148]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.

[02:51:54.361 --> 02:51:58.664]  You know, earlier I had a caller call in and I recognized his little sniveling voice.
[02:51:59.965 --> 02:52:01.786]  Someone I never did a thing to ever.
[02:52:03.266 --> 02:52:06.908]  Who just likes to flip out and make stuff up about people and I could care less.
[02:52:07.008 --> 02:52:07.649]  Just sad.
[02:52:09.970 --> 02:52:18.194]  And that individual tries to go and go, Oh, look what happened to that radio talk show host in D.C.
[02:52:18.234 --> 02:52:19.015]  I knew where it was going.
[02:52:19.990 --> 02:52:22.331]  Oh, yeah, he got censored for criticizing Israel.
[02:52:22.351 --> 02:52:24.291]  Well, other people have on Genesis.
[02:52:24.331 --> 02:52:24.872]  No, they haven't.
[02:52:26.092 --> 02:52:27.993]  What you do is you get people on the radio.
[02:52:28.013 --> 02:52:30.133]  There's been very few that have been let go from this network.
[02:52:30.913 --> 02:52:34.114]  And then they get on the air and start flipping out, attacking everyone and their dog.
[02:52:35.595 --> 02:52:37.115]  And then they start attacking the network.
[02:52:37.776 --> 02:52:39.676]  And then they start attacking all the other hosts.
[02:52:40.316 --> 02:52:41.377]  People just go, you know what?
[02:52:41.457 --> 02:52:44.618]  You can do your radio show if you want, but you don't want to attack us and say horrible things.
[02:52:44.878 --> 02:52:45.878]  Just go do it somewhere else.
[02:52:45.938 --> 02:52:47.619]  It'd be like if I invited somebody over to dinner.
[02:52:47.639 --> 02:52:48.699]  And then they...
[02:52:49.654 --> 02:52:51.516]  Defecated in the chair at the dinner table.
[02:52:51.576 --> 02:52:53.597]  I'd say, get out of here, you lunatic!
[02:52:54.778 --> 02:52:55.499]  Get away from us.
[02:52:55.559 --> 02:52:56.679]  We don't want to deal with you.
[02:52:58.261 --> 02:53:01.063]  You can ask people like Jack Blood and others or Dave and Joyce on this network.
[02:53:01.323 --> 02:53:04.926]  Genesis, frankly, Ted Anderson doesn't even hardly listen to it, okay?
[02:53:04.946 --> 02:53:06.066]  The guy's so busy with other stuff.
[02:53:06.487 --> 02:53:09.029]  In fact, I've heard hosts complain because there is no oversight.
[02:53:09.049 --> 02:53:10.290]  There is no one talking to them.
[02:53:11.430 --> 02:53:14.573]  They dial you up on the digital line and do your show and that's it.
[02:53:16.790 --> 02:53:20.632]  Until they get a hundred phone calls where your host is attacking you, saying these lies about you.
[02:53:20.912 --> 02:53:21.192]  Oh, really?
[02:53:21.212 --> 02:53:21.932]  Are you saying this about me?
[02:53:22.073 --> 02:53:23.333]  Yes, I am, scum sucker!
[02:53:23.573 --> 02:53:25.214]  Well, you better stop it three months later.
[02:53:25.434 --> 02:53:26.394]  Oh, you're calling me all this time?
[02:53:26.414 --> 02:53:27.375]  Well, just do it somewhere else.
[02:53:27.415 --> 02:53:28.075]  Okay, bye-bye.
[02:53:28.095 --> 02:53:29.976]  Ah, you censored me!
[02:53:32.897 --> 02:53:34.358]  No, that's not called censorship.
[02:53:34.378 --> 02:53:41.281]  You know, if you come to somebody's dinner table and start calling them names, you're going to go, hey, why don't you just, you know, go.
[02:53:41.461 --> 02:53:42.342]  Go make your own dinner.
[02:53:42.962 --> 02:53:43.943]  Go sit at your own table.
[02:53:43.983 --> 02:53:44.823]  Go make your own table.
[02:53:45.859 --> 02:53:51.263]  I thought I'd mention that, because so many people don't fight the New World Order because they hate the New World Order, because they're threatened by it.
[02:53:51.543 --> 02:53:59.789]  They fight it because they're losers, and they fight everyone in their lives, and they blame the fact that they're losers on the New World Order.
[02:54:00.330 --> 02:54:07.655]  Instead of being winners who are trying to defend people against the New World Order, they're just really there to aggrandize themselves and act like a bunch of lunatics.
[02:54:10.550 --> 02:54:19.354]  And then when they get in trouble or get canned, and this is other places as well, then they get mad at people who didn't even have anything to do with it.
[02:54:21.435 --> 02:54:22.275]  And then I go make a call.
[02:54:22.315 --> 02:54:23.256]  Hey, what's this all about?
[02:54:23.296 --> 02:54:23.996]  Oh, it's about this.
[02:54:24.076 --> 02:54:24.496]  Oh, really?
[02:54:25.257 --> 02:54:27.118]  Well, I didn't know I was in charge of all of that.
[02:54:29.499 --> 02:54:30.499]  And, you know, it does get old.
[02:54:31.620 --> 02:54:32.780]  I'm not a Scientologist.
[02:54:33.140 --> 02:54:34.421]  I don't know any Scientologists.
[02:54:34.461 --> 02:54:35.982]  I'm not a Catholic assassin.
[02:54:36.202 --> 02:54:36.942]  I'm not Catholic.
[02:54:38.198 --> 02:54:41.121]  I am not the head of the Shorenstein Center.
[02:54:41.141 --> 02:54:42.302]  I don't write for the New York Times.
[02:54:42.683 --> 02:54:46.427]  I'm not a billionaire manufacturing magnate from Canada.
[02:54:47.268 --> 02:54:48.629]  I'm not a Mossad agent.
[02:54:50.992 --> 02:54:52.734]  Not that it's a bad thing, but I'm not Jewish.
[02:54:53.435 --> 02:54:54.296]  My family isn't.
[02:54:54.856 --> 02:54:59.021]  This is the type of stuff that I have to deal with
[02:54:59.924 --> 02:55:14.933]  And I wish that the diseased portion of the patriot movement would realize they are losers, not getting any attention, not affecting change, not being able to reach out and get anything done, because they're so busy attacking each other like a pack of snakes.
[02:55:14.973 --> 02:55:15.553]  I mean, I watch them.
[02:55:15.573 --> 02:55:19.515]  They'll attack one person, and you know whoever's attacking one person, they'll be attacking each other next week.
[02:55:19.876 --> 02:55:20.736]  And it's just sad.
[02:55:21.897 --> 02:55:25.639]  And they get madder and madder that we have tens of millions of viewers and readers and visitors
[02:55:26.477 --> 02:55:28.277]  Every month now, it's really daunting.
[02:55:28.297 --> 02:55:29.738]  It's humbling.
[02:55:30.518 --> 02:55:31.818]  And why they get a few hundred people.
[02:55:31.838 --> 02:55:35.899]  Because misery, frankly, doesn't like company.
[02:55:36.259 --> 02:55:37.079]  People like winners.
[02:55:37.099 --> 02:55:38.099]  They don't like losers.
[02:55:38.859 --> 02:55:39.179]  Okay?
[02:55:39.439 --> 02:55:40.100]  So be a winner.
[02:55:40.220 --> 02:55:40.900]  Change your ways.
[02:55:42.660 --> 02:55:43.080]  All right.
[02:55:43.760 --> 02:55:44.420]  I'm out of time.
[02:55:45.281 --> 02:55:46.641]  I spent some time on this in the first hour.
[02:55:46.701 --> 02:55:47.321]  Not enough time.
[02:55:47.681 --> 02:55:48.741]  Belarus says U.S.
[02:55:48.761 --> 02:55:50.462]  plans school bombings on Election Day.
[02:55:51.382 --> 02:55:52.342]  Very serious news.

[02:56:15.981 --> 02:56:18.101]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:19.382 --> 02:56:21.182]  Get off the air, get to work on a new film.
[02:56:23.760 --> 02:56:24.061]  Hello!
