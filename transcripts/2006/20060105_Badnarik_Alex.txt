[00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:06.991]  I am really honored to have Michael Bagnerik in studio with us for several reasons.
[00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:12.373]  I've known Michael, I guess, about eight, nine years, and he's really been involved in local politics.
[00:00:12.373 --> 00:00:15.334]  He's helped teach Constitution classes for free.
[00:00:15.334 --> 00:00:17.835]  He really knows the Constitution, Bill of Rights.
[00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:20.736]  He's done a lot of different local TV shows, radio shows.
[00:00:20.736 --> 00:00:22.397]  He's been involved in the community.
[00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:28.039]  He's helped a lot of people that have had trouble with the corrupt government and the police being out of control.
[00:00:28.954 --> 00:00:44.544]  And then, he came from nowhere, really, just on his eloquence and his understanding of our form of government, and was able to beat out some formidable opponents for a highly contested libertarian presidential nomination.
[00:00:45.144 --> 00:00:49.946]  I mean, this is the guts of what Americana is all about.
[00:00:49.946 --> 00:00:59.609]  I mean, I'd almost call him Jacksonian in that, you know, this guy, grassroots coming from nowhere, and he really injected a lot of important information into the national debate.
[00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:08.851]  And the Libertarian Party really is the only real third party, the only serious one that doesn't, you know, flash in the pan or comet across the night sky.
[00:01:08.851 --> 00:01:09.972]  And it gets stronger and better.
[00:01:09.972 --> 00:01:12.873]  And I agree with most of the policies and views of the Libertarian Party.
[00:01:12.873 --> 00:01:13.753]  I'm more of a conservative.
[00:01:14.093 --> 00:01:20.697]  He's now running against one of the worst congressmen there is, who was literally installed, and that's Michael McCall.
[00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:39.515]  Who, of course, is married to the owner of Clear Channel's daughter, and who just so happens to own the voting machines, but we're not going to get off into all that today.
[00:01:39.515 --> 00:01:44.238]  And he's right here running for District 10 against Michael McCall.
[00:01:44.238 --> 00:01:50.343]  We've also had Stahl on, who's running for the state senate against the corridors and the toll roads and all that.
[00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:53.125]  So we're trying to really... I mean, Texas is the front line.
[00:01:53.125 --> 00:01:57.088]  We are under massive attack, and everything that's happening here is coming to your area.
[00:01:57.088 --> 00:01:59.450]  So this affects everybody in the country.
[00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.692]  And Michael Bagnerik, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[00:02:01.952 --> 00:02:02.992]  Thanks so much, Jack.
[00:02:02.992 --> 00:02:04.493]  It's good to see you again.
[00:02:04.493 --> 00:02:04.933]  You bet.
[00:02:04.933 --> 00:02:10.935]  It is really exciting to have you here in studio with us today.
[00:02:10.935 --> 00:02:27.881]  Why don't you, Michael, just kind of recap what happened during the Libertarian presidential campaign, and then I want to go through some of your personal views and policies on the toll roads in Texas and the Supreme Court ruling on private property, and then I want to just get into the Constitution itself and the true role of government.
[00:02:28.658 --> 00:02:35.302]  Well, let me first say that I am honored and very privileged to have been nominated.
[00:02:35.302 --> 00:02:40.485]  There was nobody on the convention floor more surprised than I was.
[00:02:40.485 --> 00:02:48.109]  I had done my best to bring libertarians into the party, to help push the ideas forward.
[00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:54.312]  We participated in the presidential debate that Saturday night, and the first vote
[00:02:55.962 --> 00:03:04.132]  Gary Nolan, Aaron Russo, and I split the vote, 33% each, and it was very, very dramatic and exciting.
[00:03:05.857 --> 00:03:11.662]  After I won the nomination, John Earhart and I traveled about 75,000 miles by air.
[00:03:11.662 --> 00:03:20.750]  We visited 42 states, I believe, trying to do, I think we totaled up to 400 interviews during that time.
[00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:31.079]  And one thing that was not known, David Cobb of the Green Party and I are both legitimate candidates for legitimate political parties.
[00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.340]  We were both arrested
[00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:33.182]  In St.
[00:03:33.182 --> 00:03:35.912]  Louis, attempting to attend the presidential debate.
[00:03:37.057 --> 00:03:39.358]  They put us into a, they handcuffed us.
[00:03:39.358 --> 00:03:39.938]  I remember that.
[00:03:39.938 --> 00:03:45.241]  Well, Alan Keyes was on the list back in 96 of Republican presidential candidates.
[00:03:45.241 --> 00:03:47.882]  He was getting about 12% of the time, so they were afraid of him.
[00:03:47.882 --> 00:03:53.065]  They actually kidnapped him, drove him around for an hour and threw him out in a crack-infested neighborhood.
[00:03:53.065 --> 00:03:54.786]  But did that happen to you?
[00:03:54.786 --> 00:03:55.126]  No.
[00:03:55.126 --> 00:03:57.347]  What they did was they, they were very polite.
[00:03:57.347 --> 00:04:03.790]  Once we got through the police line, they arrested us, they handcuffed us, put us into a police van and left us there.
[00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.051]  Well, about 20 minutes later, a police officer came up
[00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:10.634]  And said, which one of you guys is a presidential candidate?
[00:04:10.634 --> 00:04:13.476]  And I said, well, we are both presidential candidates.
[00:04:13.476 --> 00:04:17.478]  We are at a presidential debate, and you have us in handcuffs.
[00:04:17.478 --> 00:04:18.839]  I said, can you explain that to me?
[00:04:19.482 --> 00:04:21.503]  And the guy says, let me get back to you on that.
[00:04:21.503 --> 00:04:23.763]  Well, Alan Keyes was even on the list.
[00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:28.805]  In fact, they had Nader on and then pulled him just because the Republicans said so and then nothing ever happened.
[00:04:28.805 --> 00:04:30.145]  He wasn't even allowed to be in the audience.
[00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:30.865]  Right.
[00:04:30.865 --> 00:04:33.866]  Well, that's basically what we were trying to do is to be in the audience.
[00:04:33.866 --> 00:04:36.887]  I also was acting as a process server.
[00:04:36.887 --> 00:04:42.389]  The third debate in Arizona was paid for by tax money on a
[00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:46.032]  Tax funded campus.
[00:04:46.032 --> 00:04:53.980]  And so the Arizona Libertarians filed a lawsuit and said you either have to let Michael in the debate or shut down the debate.
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.066]  And we had this court order that I was going to try to present to the... Oh, that's right!
[00:04:59.066 --> 00:05:02.069]  You even get the courts ordering it and they still ignore it.
[00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:03.851]  That's the thing about the government now.
[00:05:03.851 --> 00:05:04.772]  They just do whatever they want.
[00:05:05.252 --> 00:05:07.854]  I never really got a chance to present that paperwork.
[00:05:07.854 --> 00:05:14.439]  So, the interesting thing as far as I'm concerned... Well, my point is, it had been in the news that you guys had the order.
[00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:16.120]  They knew and they just didn't care.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.382]  And, well, it was never advertised.
[00:05:18.382 --> 00:05:23.106]  The fact that David Nye had been arrested was only broadcast on my blog and his blog.
[00:05:23.106 --> 00:05:23.746]  We covered it here.
[00:05:24.046 --> 00:05:25.509]  Oh, that's excellent, thank you.
[00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:28.413]  So, we were trying to get that information out.
[00:05:28.413 --> 00:05:33.320]  But you'd think that'd be newsworthy, because all over the country they were talking about how they were shutting everybody out of the debate.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.586]  How are we going to have a legitimate third party if we can't ever even get people in the debate?
[00:05:37.586 --> 00:05:39.128]  There should be ten guys up there.
[00:05:39.128 --> 00:05:39.649]  Absolutely.
[00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:43.710]  So, it was a very interesting and exciting process.
[00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:58.656]  I'm, again, honored to have been able to represent the Libertarian Party, and this year, in order to continue lighting the fires of liberty, we've decided the best thing for me to do is to run for Congress in 2006.
[00:05:58.656 --> 00:06:01.817]  Well, that's exciting, and I want to talk about later why you're doing that.
[00:06:01.817 --> 00:06:08.520]  Just out of the gate, I don't think most Americans realize that when we've been saying 6,000 miles of toll roads, it's now 8,000 miles of toll roads.
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.140]  This is official.
[00:06:10.046 --> 00:06:12.009]  And the whole country only has 7,000 miles of toll roads.
[00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:14.993]  We're going to have transponders and all the inspection stickers.
[00:06:14.993 --> 00:06:16.615]  We narrowly beat that bill last year.
[00:06:16.615 --> 00:06:18.417]  That was going to start this year.
[00:06:18.417 --> 00:06:23.624]  But TxDOT's still moving ahead with this program to turn basically all major roads into toll roads.
[00:06:25.627 --> 00:06:28.190]  I'm also against them.
[00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.014]  Libertarians in general would like to privatize issues.
[00:06:32.014 --> 00:06:33.876]  We don't want to eliminate the decision
[00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:56.512]  We just want to move the decision-making process from Washington, or the state government, into the local county governments, or better, for education, back into the individual homes.
[00:06:56.512 --> 00:06:59.353]  But see, they advertise this as privatization, but it's not.
[00:06:59.353 --> 00:07:07.116]  It's like in Russia, when they pay off the president, and then he just gives an industry to some robber baron, or they call them oligarchs over there.
[00:07:07.116 --> 00:07:11.657]  They just, oh, here, you're a foreign Spanish company, we're going to give you our existing roads,
[00:07:12.137 --> 00:07:13.398]  No, I don't see that as privatization.
[00:07:13.398 --> 00:07:17.501]  And what they generally do is they take a word and then change the definition and then feed it back
[00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:40.076]  So would privatization be if a group of investors got together and bought right-of-ways and built their own toll road and said, if you want to use it, pay us 50 cents?
[00:07:40.076 --> 00:07:40.797]  That's right.
[00:07:40.797 --> 00:07:43.298]  You know, it had to be, you know, an investment.
[00:07:43.298 --> 00:07:47.681]  It's not simply the lack of the fact that you've elected any of these people.
[00:07:48.303 --> 00:08:01.690]  You know, these people, if the government is giving this monopoly to a particular company, just because you haven't voted for the corporation heads, that doesn't mean that that's a privatized entity.
[00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:10.294]  Then there's the whole mode of how they're going to tax us with a transponder and they admit that they'll even give you tickets when you speed from radio reader to radio reader.
[00:08:10.294 --> 00:08:13.776]  They admit that they'll be able to track where you're going and what you're doing.
[00:08:13.776 --> 00:08:14.496]  What do you think about that?
[00:08:14.976 --> 00:08:17.897]  I think that's an invasion of our privacy.
[00:08:17.897 --> 00:08:24.318]  It is very much that one world order that you're telling people about.
[00:08:24.318 --> 00:08:33.140]  Well, the good news is the majority of Texas counties have now passed resolutions against it and are moving to file lawsuits and block it, so that's good news.
[00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:41.262]  That is good news and I'm very, very lucky because I think that the toll road is supposed to pass right through District 10.
[00:08:42.322 --> 00:08:42.802]  Yes.
[00:08:42.802 --> 00:08:47.686]  And the government is going to be using eminent domain to abscond with people's property.
[00:08:47.686 --> 00:08:48.847]  And that goes into my next question.
[00:08:48.847 --> 00:08:56.712]  Yes, the main artery, the main central trunk or hub is I-35 from Mexico up into Canada right through Minneapolis-St.
[00:08:56.712 --> 00:08:58.073]  Paul, as you know, Michael.
[00:08:58.653 --> 00:09:04.939]  And yes, they're saying that 10 miles on each side, they can just take it and then not even pay you just compensation.
[00:09:04.939 --> 00:09:06.901]  That's the new spin and the new London thing.
[00:09:06.901 --> 00:09:11.566]  Not just they're saying if some private group wants to pay off a politician to take your land, we can take it.
[00:09:11.566 --> 00:09:14.328]  Now it's that we give you what we say the value is.
[00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:19.115]  And this is one of the things that I debate with people on.
[00:09:19.115 --> 00:09:30.770]  They tell me that the Constitution, specifically the Fifth Amendment, allows eminent domain, but it's the question of, you know, what is just compensation and who decides that?
[00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:32.473]  If you're buying something from me,
[00:09:33.217 --> 00:09:35.379]  You know, I decide what the cost is.
[00:09:35.379 --> 00:09:36.619]  Best use can be demonstrated.
[00:09:36.619 --> 00:09:38.721]  And then you can decide whether you want to pay that.
[00:09:38.721 --> 00:09:39.541]  But they're not even doing that.
[00:09:39.541 --> 00:09:43.324]  They condemn your house and then say, OK, it's only worth the lot value.
[00:09:43.324 --> 00:09:47.887]  Even though you've got a $300,000 house on the books, we're just going to give you lot value.
[00:09:47.887 --> 00:09:57.833]  Within a few weeks of the Supreme Court decision on Kelo versus New London, I got about a dozen anonymous phone calls from across the country.
[00:09:57.833 --> 00:09:59.735]  People know that I'm a constitutional scholar.
[00:09:59.735 --> 00:10:01.556]  And they were calling to ask.
[00:10:01.556 --> 00:10:03.077]  The Supreme Court can't do that.
[00:10:03.277 --> 00:10:04.357]  Can they?
[00:10:04.357 --> 00:10:07.398]  And realistically, these people already know the answer.
[00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:11.139]  They're just calling me so that I would confirm what they already know.
[00:10:11.139 --> 00:10:13.480]  Let's talk about that in detail and get into the Constitution.
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:18.862]  I'm going to spend the bulk of our time together, and if you can today, spend a few minutes into the next hour because we've got you started a little bit later.
[00:10:18.862 --> 00:10:21.463]  Setting up some cameras so we can put this on the TV show, Michael.
[00:10:21.463 --> 00:10:28.465]  But I want to specifically, because it's one thing to say the federal government or the state government, if they want to build a hospital or a road, can make you sell.
[00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:33.329]  For a good value of the property.
[00:10:33.329 --> 00:10:36.432]  But what about when private corporations want your land?
[00:10:36.432 --> 00:10:37.373]  We'll be right back.
[00:10:37.373 --> 00:10:37.814]  Stay with us.
[00:10:40.419 --> 00:10:45.141]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[00:10:45.141 --> 00:10:48.863]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[00:10:48.863 --> 00:10:57.246]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[00:10:57.246 --> 00:11:02.889]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[00:11:03.189 --> 00:11:08.696]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[00:11:08.696 --> 00:11:11.038]  This is why you need the Filter Mag.
[00:11:11.038 --> 00:11:23.193]  The Filter Mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[00:11:23.413 --> 00:11:28.056]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[00:11:28.056 --> 00:11:29.176]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:11:29.176 --> 00:11:30.937]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[00:11:30.937 --> 00:11:32.999]  That's FilterMag.com.
[00:11:32.999 --> 00:11:33.479]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[00:11:33.479 --> 00:11:33.679]  That's 800-345-8376.
[00:11:40.459 --> 00:11:47.143]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:11:47.143 --> 00:11:55.249]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:11:55.249 --> 00:12:03.094]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:12:03.414 --> 00:12:08.495]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:12:08.495 --> 00:12:13.716]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:12:13.716 --> 00:12:18.077]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:12:18.077 --> 00:12:19.157]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:12:19.157 --> 00:12:23.658]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[00:12:48.742 --> 00:13:00.251]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:13:00.251 --> 00:13:03.234]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:13:03.234 --> 00:13:07.337]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled,
[00:13:07.537 --> 00:13:09.839]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:13:09.839 --> 00:13:11.900]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:18.184]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:13:18.184 --> 00:13:23.768]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:13:24.168 --> 00:13:28.113]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:13:40.057 --> 00:13:43.679]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[00:13:43.679 --> 00:13:44.039]  Why?
[00:13:44.039 --> 00:13:47.060]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:52.123]  Cardivite drops and capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.

[00:14:26.362 --> 00:14:27.523]  Don't let heart disease beat you.
[00:14:27.523 --> 00:14:29.084]  Beat the odds and do your body right with Cardivite.
[00:14:44.348 --> 00:14:46.651]  Alright, we're back with Michael Bagnerik.
[00:14:46.651 --> 00:14:50.094]  Of course, he was a Libertarian presidential candidate who gave him a good run.
[00:14:50.094 --> 00:14:53.618]  And he's now running for Congress, District 10, right here deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:14:53.618 --> 00:14:58.002]  Imagine having another Ron Paul, both of them from Texas.
[00:14:58.002 --> 00:15:01.225]  Is Paul's district still called 14 after they rewrote it?
[00:15:01.225 --> 00:15:02.627]  As far as I know, yes.
[00:15:02.627 --> 00:15:06.731]  Yeah, it's, boy, I tell you, they really wrote it to beat him, but he's saying it's not going to work.
[00:15:07.535 --> 00:15:08.415]  I mean, his own party.
[00:15:08.415 --> 00:15:14.478]  Imagine Ron Paul's own party, the Republicans, riding the district up to give it to the Democrats over him.
[00:15:14.478 --> 00:15:15.158]  Yeah.
[00:15:15.158 --> 00:15:20.081]  And I think they were a little bit surprised when the Democrats did not run a candidate in 2004.
[00:15:20.081 --> 00:15:24.363]  Ron Paul was unopposed, fortunately.
[00:15:24.363 --> 00:15:30.405]  And so we're a little bit interested to see who's going to be running against him in 2006.
[00:15:30.405 --> 00:15:33.367]  Absolutely.
[00:15:33.367 --> 00:15:34.047]  Who's the Democrat?
[00:15:34.047 --> 00:15:35.308]  Who are they trying to run against, McCaul?
[00:15:37.256 --> 00:15:49.063]  Against McCaul, we have five Democrats that have recently registered, and they're going to have to go through their primary to decide which of their candidates is going to be the nominee.
[00:15:49.063 --> 00:15:50.444]  You know, I mean, this is just my advice.
[00:15:50.444 --> 00:15:52.525]  I know Ron Paul would win in Central Texas.
[00:15:52.525 --> 00:15:55.807]  Isn't there any way you can kind of brand yourself as a Ron Paul libertarian?
[00:15:55.807 --> 00:15:57.247]  I'm certainly hoping to.
[00:15:57.247 --> 00:16:00.549]  I want people to know that I'm a Ron Paul with attitude.
[00:16:00.549 --> 00:16:02.450]  I want to go to Washington, D.C.
[00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:03.791]  and really stir things up.
[00:16:04.782 --> 00:16:05.222]  I love it.
[00:16:05.222 --> 00:16:07.584]  I mean, Michael, you know what?
[00:16:07.584 --> 00:16:09.625]  Nobody needs to be beaten worse than Michael McCaul.
[00:16:09.625 --> 00:16:11.166]  I don't think people really know his record.
[00:16:11.166 --> 00:16:24.494]  Instead of bashing him all day, our listeners know he's bad news, but I mean, Janet Reno's toady on Waco and a bunch of other horrible stuff, Chinagate, protecting the chi-coms, and then now he's this little anti-terror czar up in Congress.
[00:16:24.494 --> 00:16:25.315]  I mean, he's a nightmare.
[00:16:25.635 --> 00:16:28.836]  Well, we're going to be working very, very hard in District 10.
[00:16:28.836 --> 00:16:32.638]  We're beginning a listening tour this month.
[00:16:32.638 --> 00:16:34.979]  We're going to go out and talk to the voters.
[00:16:34.979 --> 00:16:38.440]  We want to know what the voters think about Washington government.
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:44.702]  What they think about the Texas corridor and all of the issues here in Central Texas.
[00:16:44.702 --> 00:16:50.164]  Well, I think having a successful presidential candidate, I mean, you were successful, got a lot of attention, got a lot of information out to the people.
[00:16:50.164 --> 00:16:54.106]  I think that really adds an entree to you and plus you're from right here in Austin.
[00:16:54.326 --> 00:16:59.369]  Well, I think what sets me apart is the fact that I am willing to work so hard.
[00:16:59.369 --> 00:17:05.912]  We have an office staff already who we're putting in 10 to 12 hours a day, and this is just the beginning of the campaign.
[00:17:05.912 --> 00:17:11.755]  We have every intention of walking the district, shaking hands, and meeting as many of the constituents as possible.
[00:17:11.755 --> 00:17:12.376]  Well, we know this.
[00:17:12.376 --> 00:17:15.497]  We know the Democrats are all a bunch of pro-war mongering idiots.
[00:17:15.497 --> 00:17:17.738]  We know they're for big government, gun control.
[00:17:17.738 --> 00:17:18.959]  Michael Bagnerik isn't, are you?
[00:17:19.199 --> 00:17:19.700]  No.
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.123]  No, absolutely.
[00:17:21.123 --> 00:17:24.270]  Again, we want to reduce the size of government.
[00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:30.483]  If we got rid of the IRS and you got to keep your money, you'd probably do something really silly like spend it.
[00:17:31.329 --> 00:17:34.290]  And we'd have small businesses springing up all over the place.
[00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:44.992]  Well, back when this country had a 20% growth rate a year, a hundred and something years ago, we didn't have an income tax and the government had some puny tariffs that were meant just to protect our industries.
[00:17:44.992 --> 00:17:45.473]  That's right.
[00:17:45.473 --> 00:17:46.833]  Why can't we go back to that?
[00:17:46.833 --> 00:17:48.113]  Well, I think that we can.
[00:17:48.113 --> 00:17:51.874]  And that's what I would like to do.
[00:17:51.874 --> 00:17:57.936]  Whatever your job is, you make 100% of your pay and the government takes a certain percentage of it.
[00:17:57.936 --> 00:17:59.456]  And that percentage keeps getting larger.
[00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:04.282]  Well, either you can take your money home or you can give it to the government.
[00:18:04.282 --> 00:18:06.126]  Who spends your money better?
[00:18:06.126 --> 00:18:06.266]  You?
[00:18:07.097 --> 00:18:09.138]  Or the government that's supposed to represent you.
[00:18:09.138 --> 00:18:17.563]  Well, the thing is, the government, even in major studies they've had over the last 30 years, that they really get more into their treasury when they lower taxes.
[00:18:17.563 --> 00:18:18.664]  People go, how does that work?
[00:18:18.664 --> 00:18:20.585]  Because the economy speeds up so fast.
[00:18:20.585 --> 00:18:26.569]  Kennedy cut taxes by 50% and the treasury in one year, the amount of receipts coming in, doubled.
[00:18:26.569 --> 00:18:28.550]  Well, then why do they want to jack them up even more?
[00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:29.771]  It's about control.
[00:18:29.771 --> 00:18:31.652]  They're trying to control the economy.
[00:18:32.032 --> 00:18:37.756]  And if the Federal Reserve can print more money, why do they need to take your taxes if they can just print more?
[00:18:37.756 --> 00:18:38.497]  Well, that's the thing.
[00:18:38.497 --> 00:18:42.239]  The Federal Reserve right now, Michael, is going into overdrive.
[00:18:42.239 --> 00:18:51.586]  The new chairman is saying he's going to print money even faster than Greenspan, and inflation's really at about 10%, but even if it's 5%, like they claim it is,
[00:18:52.306 --> 00:18:57.769]  If growth of the economy is 3.4, over a decade you're losing a lot of money.
[00:18:57.769 --> 00:18:59.650]  That is actually recessionary.
[00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:01.311]  Your comments?
[00:19:01.311 --> 00:19:01.791]  I agree.
[00:19:01.791 --> 00:19:05.894]  I think that people need to understand that a little bit more.
[00:19:05.894 --> 00:19:12.357]  But I think that as soon as you start talking about the Federal Reserve, most people on the sidewalk just kind of their eyes glaze over.
[00:19:12.357 --> 00:19:15.559]  It's a little bit too complicated for them as the first thing to talk about.
[00:19:15.559 --> 00:19:19.661]  Maybe you should just tell them the Federal Reserve doesn't like Vince Young.
[00:19:21.644 --> 00:19:26.370]  Well, I just want to tell them that we're going to let them spend their money.
[00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:30.475]  And, you know, let them decide the best way to improve their life.
[00:19:30.475 --> 00:19:33.478]  We get the economy going again, that's good for everybody.
[00:19:33.478 --> 00:19:38.204]  But I mean, maybe we should just boil it down to, like, ugging and grunting and just say that
[00:19:38.744 --> 00:19:44.973]  Well, I think that the American public is figuring it out, as I said earlier, after the Supreme Court decision on Kelo v. New London.
[00:19:55.367 --> 00:19:59.290]  We were going to talk about that, now we've got a break again, but I want to get into that when we get back.
[00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:02.151]  What are we going to talk about with that, the Kelo?
[00:20:02.151 --> 00:20:10.237]  I was just going to point out that people, that decision brought people into the political arena that had never been concerned about politics before.
[00:20:10.237 --> 00:20:11.418]  Oh, you're saying it was a wake-up call?
[00:20:11.418 --> 00:20:17.902]  It was a wake-up call, absolutely a wake-up call, and I think that in the long run that's going to be very helpful to us.
[00:20:17.902 --> 00:20:20.504]  Well, let's go through just your one-on-one when we get back.
[00:20:20.504 --> 00:20:22.265]  Let's see, you had five, ten minutes with a group of
[00:20:22.945 --> 00:20:25.227]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:20:25.227 --> 00:20:27.109]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:40.696 --> 00:20:43.317]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:20:43.317 --> 00:20:47.458]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[00:20:47.458 --> 00:20:48.718]  Read the labels.
[00:20:48.718 --> 00:20:53.059]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:20:53.059 --> 00:20:57.621]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:20:57.621 --> 00:21:02.482]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:21:02.882 --> 00:21:06.645]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:21:06.645 --> 00:21:12.270]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:15.293]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:21:15.293 --> 00:21:16.494]  So what are you waiting for?

[00:21:40.251 --> 00:21:46.633]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:21:46.633 --> 00:21:53.075]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:21:53.075 --> 00:22:01.438]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:22:01.738 --> 00:22:09.084]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:22:09.084 --> 00:22:14.128]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.

[00:23:43.348 --> 00:23:49.590]  I want to now, with Michael Bagneri, get into the Constitution, the Bill of Rights.
[00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:53.691]  About five, six years ago, he did a video presentation, which I've got to get a copy of.
[00:23:53.691 --> 00:24:01.634]  I ought to call my friend Chris Athanas and get a copy of that that he produced for local TV and maybe even sell it out of the office or something once I approach him about it, but we never did anything.
[00:24:02.354 --> 00:24:12.744]  It's just an hour-long program where Michael Bagnerich is sitting there in a backyard at a table going through the Constitution, but then Chris Athanas built all these graphics to explain it and how it works.
[00:24:12.744 --> 00:24:18.289]  And at the end of it, I mean, just a layman will really understand how beautiful it is, how important it is.
[00:24:18.289 --> 00:24:21.512]  Red Beckman in years past, one of the granddaddies of this movement for liberty,
[00:24:22.032 --> 00:24:23.813]  Rediscovering Liberty.
[00:24:23.813 --> 00:24:33.820]  He had like four or five hour seminars he would go over, explaining the role of the people above the government, not the people below the government.
[00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:37.323]  In a situation where you're a slave, the government is above you.
[00:24:37.323 --> 00:24:40.565]  And they're officials, they're authorities.
[00:24:40.565 --> 00:24:43.367]  And then down here, we're their minions.
[00:24:43.367 --> 00:24:46.569]  But in a free society, they're servants, and we're the sovereigns.
[00:24:46.569 --> 00:24:49.832]  But we'll talk about that in a few minutes, before we go back to Michael Bagnerik.
[00:24:49.832 --> 00:24:50.212]  And later,
[00:24:51.318 --> 00:24:55.821]  He's going to be with us some into the next hour, and we'll take a few phone calls if you'd like to talk to him at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:55.821 --> 00:24:56.041]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:56.041 --> 00:24:58.983]  But before we go back to Michael Magnarik...
[00:25:05.794 --> 00:25:07.436]  This is the last few days.
[00:25:07.436 --> 00:25:11.140]  On Sunday we're going to take the specials down.
[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:20.409]  You can get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership, all 14 of my films, all my weekly TV reports, all my special interviews that we're doing here in studio.
[00:25:20.409 --> 00:25:23.633]  Not only now will you get the weekly TV reports we do,
[00:25:24.786 --> 00:25:31.252]  But you'll also get at least, you know, every week at least one person we're going to interview in studio.
[00:25:31.252 --> 00:25:37.898]  You'll get the video of that with documents and with information posted within that little mini-documentary.
[00:25:37.898 --> 00:25:40.960]  In fact, we're videotaping this with a two-camera shoot right now.
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:44.243]  That's going to be on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:25:44.243 --> 00:25:50.869]  So, PrisonPlanet.tv, all my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, a bunch of other books and videos we've posted and authorized to post.
[00:25:51.669 --> 00:25:53.351]  It's normally 15 cents a day.
[00:25:53.351 --> 00:25:55.874]  You can get a monthly subscription for $5.95.
[00:25:55.874 --> 00:25:57.775]  But we have yearly subscriptions.
[00:25:57.775 --> 00:26:00.378]  Well, right now you get 5 plus months.
[00:26:00.378 --> 00:26:03.281]  5.3 months is what it comes out to.
[00:26:03.281 --> 00:26:05.423]  Free when you get a yearly subscription.
[00:26:05.423 --> 00:26:09.166]  That's only going for about 3 or 4 more days.
[00:26:09.166 --> 00:26:11.128]  So go to prisonplanet.tv and get a membership.
[00:26:12.646 --> 00:26:25.928]  If you want a hard copy of my new film, Martial Law, that exposes who was really behind 9-11 and what the globalist master plan is and the latest police state developments, it's a mini-series, three hours long, on one DVD or one VHS.
[00:26:25.928 --> 00:26:30.509]  We've got specials running on that until next week, the first of next week.
[00:26:30.509 --> 00:26:33.550]  We have specials on my new film, The Order of Death.
[00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:39.131]  When you get The Order of Death, it comes with the re-edited, updated Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:26:39.131 --> 00:26:41.651]  Two films on one DVD for one price.
[00:26:42.391 --> 00:26:44.492]  Just a whole plethora of specials.
[00:26:44.492 --> 00:26:48.973]  T-shirts that are normally $19.95 are $9.95 right now.
[00:26:48.973 --> 00:26:51.754]  It's all up on Infowars.com.
[00:26:51.754 --> 00:26:54.174]  And when you support us, we're able to do even more.
[00:26:54.174 --> 00:26:56.475]  We're able to expand what we do on the Internet.
[00:26:56.475 --> 00:27:02.156]  We're able to engage in more productions and more high-quality productions.
[00:27:02.156 --> 00:27:09.058]  So you're really contributing to the frontline fight against the globalists and their world government program of enslavement.
[00:27:09.418 --> 00:27:21.828]  So again, Infowars.com to get hard copies, or PrisonPlanet.tv, or call toll-free to get my documentaries at 1-888-253-3139.
[00:27:21.828 --> 00:27:26.371]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:27:26.371 --> 00:27:27.652]  Please take advantage of that.
[00:27:27.652 --> 00:27:34.398]  Michael Bagnerik, again, former presidential candidate on the Libertarian ticket in 2004, their last major candidate, one of their most successful.
[00:27:34.978 --> 00:27:43.700]  Now running for Congress, I think he has a shot at it, against Michael McCaul, District 10, and that's up, you know, from Georgetown down south of Austin.
[00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:45.840]  It is the Central Capital District.
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:50.441]  He'd be another Ron Paul, his policies are excellent up there on the Hill.
[00:27:50.441 --> 00:27:51.421]  We need him.
[00:27:51.421 --> 00:28:03.364]  Before we get into the Constitution, and you really are a constitutional scholar and you teach those classes, which makes you, you know, the right man for the job, tell us about your website, your campaign, how folks get involved.
[00:28:04.248 --> 00:28:19.127]  The website is very easy, it's badnarik.org, B-A-D-N-A-R-I-K dot O-R-G, and you can go there, find out our address, our phone number.
[00:28:19.127 --> 00:28:20.749]  Our phone number is 512-833-9000.
[00:28:26.255 --> 00:28:27.517]  637-6860.
[00:28:27.517 --> 00:28:32.422]  And if you live... Well, we are making this a nationwide campaign.
[00:28:32.422 --> 00:28:36.105]  We want people to call in from all 50 states.
[00:28:36.105 --> 00:28:43.853]  Ron Paul gets contributions from all 50 states, and we are hoping to do, you know, very close to the same thing.
[00:28:44.033 --> 00:28:51.661]  Well, it's going to take money to go after the CHICOM's operative, Michael McCall.
[00:28:51.661 --> 00:28:54.784]  Give that website out again, and please give us that phone number again.
[00:28:54.784 --> 00:29:04.214]  The website is badnarek.org, B-A-D-N-A-R-I-K dot O-R-G, and the phone number is 5-1-2
[00:29:06.938 --> 00:29:17.432]  And we've got a link to it up on Infowars.com, but will you spell out Bagnard for us?
[00:29:17.432 --> 00:29:17.973]  Yes.
[00:29:17.973 --> 00:29:21.377]  B as in boy, A, D as in dog, N-A-R-I-K.
[00:29:23.971 --> 00:29:28.432]  Folks, you need to go to Infowars.com if you didn't write that down or if you missed that address.
[00:29:28.432 --> 00:29:34.234]  We have a big link to it right there in the guest section on the front page to Michael Bagnerik's website.
[00:29:34.234 --> 00:29:37.435]  Now, we've got some time in this segment.
[00:29:37.435 --> 00:29:41.176]  Let's go through, for those that don't know, I know most of our audience is pretty well-educated,
[00:29:41.756 --> 00:30:03.190]  I mean, there's so much to know about the Founding Fathers, the struggle, why America was different, what a republic is, and then maybe talk about the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, the Tenth Amendment, some of the things that are really under attack right now, and where Washington has gone wrong, because Washington just announces itself as God, and so many people think, well, if they say they're God, they must be.
[00:30:11.696 --> 00:30:12.656]  We're good to go.
[00:30:28.061 --> 00:30:32.722]  The power that Congress has is granted to them by the people.
[00:30:32.722 --> 00:30:34.603]  Government has privileges.
[00:30:34.603 --> 00:30:37.344]  We, the people, have rights.
[00:30:37.344 --> 00:30:38.424]  And you need to know the difference.
[00:30:38.424 --> 00:30:43.946]  And anyone who denies that need only look to the preamble of the Declaration of Independence.
[00:30:43.946 --> 00:30:44.626]  Right.
[00:30:44.626 --> 00:30:50.728]  We have the right to alter or abolish any government that is violating our rights.
[00:30:50.728 --> 00:30:51.788]  But we're also compelled.
[00:30:51.788 --> 00:30:52.709]  It's our duty.
[00:30:52.709 --> 00:30:55.569]  Yes, later in the Declaration it does say that.
[00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:04.318]  The foundation of my Constitution class is the difference between rights and privileges.
[00:31:04.318 --> 00:31:08.043]  A right is something that you can do without asking for permission.
[00:31:08.786 --> 00:31:14.150]  A privilege, on the other hand, is something that someone of a higher authority allows you to do.
[00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:20.053]  So a right is organic and springs from the wellspring of human life and this planet.
[00:31:20.053 --> 00:31:21.775]  I mean, we have the right to not be slaves.
[00:31:21.775 --> 00:31:24.256]  We have the right to defend ourselves if someone's trying to kill us.
[00:31:24.256 --> 00:31:24.937]  Absolutely.
[00:31:24.937 --> 00:31:30.040]  We have the right to not go be slaves in the military.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.722]  Well, to put it simply, we have the right to be left alone.
[00:31:32.722 --> 00:31:32.902]  Yes.
[00:31:33.522 --> 00:31:35.965]  So, we the people have rights.
[00:31:35.965 --> 00:31:39.709]  We gave certain limited privileges to the government.
[00:31:39.709 --> 00:31:42.372]  The government works for us, not the other way around.
[00:31:42.372 --> 00:31:46.276]  They have limited powers that they've been delegated by us, their bosses.
[00:31:46.276 --> 00:31:47.397]  Absolutely.
[00:31:47.397 --> 00:31:51.041]  Now, you and I both know that they haven't paid attention to the Constitution.
[00:31:51.041 --> 00:31:52.002]  I doubt that they've read it.
[00:31:52.617 --> 00:31:59.341]  They've usurped it aggressively and are now trying to perfect a total despotism.
[00:31:59.341 --> 00:32:00.442]  Absolutely.
[00:32:00.442 --> 00:32:02.963]  So, simple examples.
[00:32:02.963 --> 00:32:09.627]  I will wager none of your listeners has a church permit.
[00:32:09.627 --> 00:32:16.271]  Nobody within the sound of our voice has filled out a government form that allows them to exercise their religion.
[00:32:17.196 --> 00:32:21.419]  Because religion is... we have a right to freedom of religion.
[00:32:21.419 --> 00:32:25.943]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:32:25.943 --> 00:32:27.104]  Absolutely.
[00:32:27.104 --> 00:32:31.588]  And if you ask somebody for their church permit, they look at you like you've grown another head.
[00:32:31.588 --> 00:32:33.509]  Well, that's the way the First Amendment works.
[00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:35.431]  Well, if that's true, then why
[00:32:36.091 --> 00:32:42.475]  Do you or I have to get a concealed carry permit in order to exercise our right to keep and bear arms?
[00:32:42.475 --> 00:32:43.155]  Well, that's the thing.
[00:32:43.155 --> 00:32:48.239]  We think it's a victory to get a concealed carry, and after two years, crime in every state drops by around 20 percent.
[00:32:48.239 --> 00:32:49.699]  You know, some states 18, some 25.
[00:32:49.699 --> 00:32:50.820]  Florida's like 25, we're about 20 percent.
[00:32:52.381 --> 00:32:54.602]  People think, well, at least crime's going down, I can carry a gun.
[00:32:54.602 --> 00:32:57.164]  But wait a minute, they've now turned a right into a privilege.
[00:32:57.164 --> 00:33:09.110]  You're acquiescing and by color of law, possession is nine-tenths of the law, by the basic custom, you are now creating a false common law that it is a privilege.
[00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.631]  That's right.
[00:33:09.631 --> 00:33:11.272]  It's kind of a de facto law.
[00:33:11.272 --> 00:33:13.813]  It's just the way everybody assumes that it is.
[00:33:13.813 --> 00:33:16.675]  I guess I could have just shortened my whole diatribe and said color of law.
[00:33:20.153 --> 00:33:26.234]  One of the big things that happened last year was the Supreme Court decision on Kelo versus New London.
[00:33:26.234 --> 00:33:34.756]  The whole purpose of the Constitution and the government that it creates is to protect your life, your liberty, and private property.
[00:33:34.756 --> 00:33:42.578]  And the Kelo decision basically struck that down, reversed everything, and said the government can take your property pretty much for anything it wants.
[00:33:43.498 --> 00:33:53.281]  And, as I said earlier, I had about a dozen anonymous phone calls, people calling me up to confirm that, I mean, the Supreme Court's not supposed to be able to do that.
[00:33:53.281 --> 00:33:56.342]  Well, they do it because they can get away with it.
[00:33:56.342 --> 00:34:00.884]  We, the people, need to stand up and we need to understand the Constitution.
[00:34:01.522 --> 00:34:10.650]  We need to understand what privileges we have given the government so that when the government violates those privileges, we can call them to task.
[00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:11.391]  Well, that's the thing.
[00:34:11.391 --> 00:34:13.973]  I mean, a citizen's rulebook, and you've got one right here.
[00:34:13.973 --> 00:34:18.077]  You've got the United States Constitution, you know, right here.
[00:34:18.077 --> 00:34:19.038]  It's so simple.
[00:34:19.038 --> 00:34:20.639]  I mean, this is what America is.
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:22.441]  Absolutely.
[00:34:22.441 --> 00:34:31.646]  And the average person, they know all about Vince Young's passing record, they know all about the Dallas Cowboys, which, fine, if you want to know about that, know about it.
[00:34:31.646 --> 00:34:36.048]  Why I get angry is, though, they know nothing about the playbook of America.
[00:34:36.048 --> 00:34:37.229]  That's right.
[00:34:37.229 --> 00:34:46.774]  But they'll tell you they've got rights all day, they'll tell you it's a free country, but then I know, because I've researched this in depth, and you know because you've researched it, they're totally violating it.
[00:34:46.774 --> 00:34:47.695]  I mean, the new London
[00:34:48.553 --> 00:34:52.195]  Supreme Court ruling for those that don't know, and I want you to elaborate on this.
[00:34:52.195 --> 00:34:53.655]  But we've interviewed the parties involved.
[00:34:53.655 --> 00:35:01.459]  The big secret is, as I said earlier, they don't just take your property, they then don't even give you what it says on the tax rolls it's worth.
[00:35:01.459 --> 00:35:07.101]  And normally, best use could be anywhere from three to ten times what the tax roll says.
[00:35:07.101 --> 00:35:13.744]  But $300,000 houses, $307,000 in one case, they go, well, we'll give you $50,000 because a lot price.
[00:35:13.744 --> 00:35:15.965]  But if you fight us in court, and this happened five years ago,
[00:35:16.485 --> 00:35:16.985]  We're good to go.
[00:35:34.663 --> 00:35:58.159]  said that if a local politician wants to just give your land or say they're going to give your land to some local private developer because he can do something better with it and quote pay more taxes that goes back to the Queen saying I'm gonna take your noble lands and give it to another noble because he says he can do more for me I mean that is that not classical feudalism?
[00:35:58.159 --> 00:35:58.819]  Absolutely!
[00:35:59.279 --> 00:36:03.762]  And again, once people start to recognize that, and I think they are.
[00:36:03.762 --> 00:36:05.723]  That's why I'm optimistic.
[00:36:05.723 --> 00:36:15.249]  I think the average person on the street is starting to understand just how vast the usurpation of government power has been.
[00:36:15.249 --> 00:36:18.111]  I mean, your listeners have been following you for a long time.
[00:36:18.111 --> 00:36:20.212]  They know most of these details.
[00:36:20.212 --> 00:36:22.874]  The thing is that your average person on the street
[00:36:25.997 --> 00:36:29.521]  We've now got about 10 new affiliates in the last two weeks, so we've got a lot of new listeners.
[00:36:29.521 --> 00:36:30.542]  Bobby, boil it down for them.
[00:36:32.295 --> 00:36:36.017]  The purpose of the Constitution and the government is to protect your property.
[00:36:36.017 --> 00:36:36.717]  They're not.
[00:36:36.717 --> 00:36:40.319]  They're taking your property, they're not even paying you for it.
[00:36:40.319 --> 00:36:55.104]  We just had the President admit on television not long ago that, oh yes, we are spying on people inside the United States, and well, we didn't get a warrant because that was really kind of a nuisance for us, but it was in your best interest, so just trust me.
[00:36:55.104 --> 00:36:58.045]  But then I had a problem with the FISA Court where they can come back in a month.
[00:36:58.045 --> 00:36:59.586]  That isn't even really a real warrant either.
[00:37:00.086 --> 00:37:02.548]  Now rubber stamps aren't even good enough!
[00:37:30.426 --> 00:37:31.968]  I've heard you say that many times.
[00:37:31.968 --> 00:37:32.588]  How then?
[00:37:32.588 --> 00:37:35.631]  I mean, why is the elite just so arrogant right now?
[00:37:36.847 --> 00:37:37.948]  I don't know that.
[00:37:37.948 --> 00:37:41.931]  I wish I did understand why they think the things they do.
[00:37:41.931 --> 00:37:46.334]  I think it would help us to defeat them at the polls.
[00:37:46.334 --> 00:37:51.457]  My job right now is just to take this message to the people in District 10.
[00:37:51.457 --> 00:37:54.599]  Again, we are going to be walking the district, shaking hands with people.
[00:37:54.599 --> 00:37:59.143]  I want to get to know what people think, get an opportunity to talk to them.
[00:37:59.143 --> 00:38:00.483]  This is not rocket science.
[00:38:00.483 --> 00:38:02.265]  This is really simple stuff.
[00:38:02.265 --> 00:38:04.106]  Why do they think they can get away with it?
[00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:12.056]  I guess they've gotten away with so much more in the past that... I don't know, but I'm not going to let them do it.
[00:38:12.056 --> 00:38:15.299]  I'm going to basically win this election.
[00:38:15.299 --> 00:38:17.581]  I'm going to become the first Libertarian in Congress.
[00:38:17.581 --> 00:38:19.543]  I'm going to be there to back up Ron Paul.
[00:38:22.817 --> 00:38:26.662]  When I win, this is going to shake up the political community.
[00:38:26.662 --> 00:38:39.360]  Americans across the nation are going to understand that they do have a choice, that libertarians can win, and I think that this is going to be the beginning of restoring the republic that you and I love so much.
[00:38:40.876 --> 00:38:44.739]  Well, I tell you, I mean, all over the country people are ready.
[00:38:44.739 --> 00:38:49.522]  I mean, there are a bunch of states introducing legislation to secede right now in the north, the south.
[00:38:49.522 --> 00:38:51.523]  I mean, there's wild stuff happening.
[00:38:51.523 --> 00:39:01.290]  We need to make sure that serious professional people like yourself are leading this instead of the buffoons the media tries to so often focus in on.
[00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:02.951]  What about the Second Amendment, Michael?
[00:39:02.951 --> 00:39:07.814]  We saw actual gun confiscation of even the undamaged areas, the unflooded areas,
[00:39:08.514 --> 00:39:15.595]  The Army's first mission, with the FBI leading them, and this is all on national news, was to come in and go into rich people's homes, even.
[00:39:15.595 --> 00:39:18.776]  I say that because, you know, even the poor folks, usually they do this too.
[00:39:18.776 --> 00:39:25.637]  Now it's, we're going into the million-dollar houses, we're going to put you down in the dirt, take your guns, and then let you stay in your house where you can't defend yourself.
[00:39:25.637 --> 00:39:28.758]  What would you do as a congressman if you saw that happening?
[00:39:28.758 --> 00:39:33.819]  Oh, I would make the announcement that 20,000 gun laws in the United States are unconstitutional.
[00:39:34.319 --> 00:39:40.384]  Because they infringe on your right to self-defense and the right to defend your children.
[00:39:40.384 --> 00:39:43.646]  Self-defense is a natural right.
[00:39:43.646 --> 00:39:47.029]  Everybody has... It is the most base right.
[00:39:47.029 --> 00:39:48.970]  Only slaves are not allowed to defend themselves.
[00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:49.891]  That's right.
[00:39:49.891 --> 00:40:03.541]  And one of the reasons that I left California and moved to Texas was because the California legislature passed 18 anti-gun laws, six of which would turn me into a felon overnight.
[00:40:03.621 --> 00:40:04.942]  That was a decade ago or so.
[00:40:04.942 --> 00:40:08.663]  That was about 97, February and March of 97.
[00:40:08.663 --> 00:40:18.548]  And so, you know, I have always said that, you know, I am not going to turn over my guns to any state or federal authority, period.
[00:40:18.548 --> 00:40:24.151]  We need to retain the right to defend ourselves and the right to defend our country.
[00:40:24.151 --> 00:40:28.873]  And any government official that is trying to take your guns away from you is trying to make you a victim.
[00:40:30.402 --> 00:40:31.563]  Well, I mean, it's crazy.
[00:40:31.563 --> 00:40:34.784]  I mean, imagine going to the cops and telling them, give us your guns.
[00:40:34.784 --> 00:40:35.604]  We're not saying that.
[00:40:35.604 --> 00:40:37.265]  They should be able to defend themselves.
[00:40:37.265 --> 00:40:38.566]  Why do they want my guns?
[00:40:38.566 --> 00:40:44.528]  I know most police say they don't want our guns, but I mean, we saw in New Orleans and now in L.A., they're banning a lot of guns.
[00:40:44.528 --> 00:40:46.129]  San Francisco's outright banned them.
[00:40:46.129 --> 00:40:50.111]  We have Republican governors from Schwarzenegger to Pataki going after guns.
[00:40:50.111 --> 00:40:52.632]  We have Mayor Bloomberg saying he's declared war on guns.
[00:40:53.428 --> 00:40:57.234]  And I mean, how does that keep me safe when the cop pulls me over and has to search my car for guns?
[00:40:57.234 --> 00:40:58.355]  I mean, it's a joke!
[00:40:58.355 --> 00:40:59.497]  It is a joke.
[00:40:59.497 --> 00:41:08.671]  And statistically, any time you have strong gun control, such as Washington, D.C., New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, you also have high crime and murder.
[00:41:09.271 --> 00:41:18.625]  In all the places where people are allowed to carry guns and defend themselves, the crime rate is very low or drops precipitously as soon as they pass the law.
[00:41:18.625 --> 00:41:19.446]  Well, exactly.
[00:41:19.446 --> 00:41:24.172]  In England, after they confiscated guns about a decade ago,
[00:41:25.033 --> 00:41:27.876]  Every year the crime rate doubles until now.
[00:41:27.876 --> 00:41:31.620]  In international statistics, they have a much higher crime rate than America.
[00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:33.641]  They're number one in industrialized nations.
[00:41:33.641 --> 00:41:35.243]  We're number 14.
[00:41:35.243 --> 00:41:37.465]  Only Switzerland is safer than the U.S.
[00:41:37.465 --> 00:41:39.427]  But the mainstream media won't tell you those numbers.
[00:41:41.208 --> 00:41:48.854]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:41:48.854 --> 00:41:53.818]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:41:53.818 --> 00:41:59.462]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:41:59.702 --> 00:42:11.633]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash, the cashless society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:42:11.633 --> 00:42:16.337]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:42:16.337 --> 00:42:19.059]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:42:19.059 --> 00:42:25.785]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:42:26.005 --> 00:42:31.289]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:42:31.289 --> 00:42:31.689]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:42:40.114 --> 00:42:47.902]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:42:47.902 --> 00:43:00.855]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require very little energy.
[00:43:01.155 --> 00:43:04.797]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:43:04.797 --> 00:43:06.278]  But it's worth every penny.
[00:43:06.278 --> 00:43:15.564]  Because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:43:15.564 --> 00:43:16.244]  That's right!
[00:43:16.244 --> 00:43:23.649]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:43:23.649 --> 00:43:27.931]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[00:43:27.931 --> 00:43:29.812]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10.
[00:43:30.953 --> 00:43:36.016]  We're calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:43:36.016 --> 00:43:39.638]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.

[00:44:41.099 --> 00:44:46.102]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:44:46.892 --> 00:44:50.194]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:44:50.194 --> 00:45:07.705]  The former presidential candidate of the Libertarian Party, really one of the only serious third parties out there, and now the third largest office-holding party in the country, he's now running for District 10 right here in Central Texas against Michael McCaul, who really is one of the worst congressmen we have.
[00:45:07.705 --> 00:45:09.646]  He is a horrible police state
[00:45:10.574 --> 00:45:16.776]  Minion, Maven, Pusher, Pimp, whatever you want to call him and he's really got to be stopped.
[00:45:17.339 --> 00:45:23.881]  And so be sure to go to InfoWars.com and link through to Bagnaric's website over there.
[00:45:23.881 --> 00:45:25.401]  Michael Bagnaric is our guest.
[00:45:25.401 --> 00:45:29.303]  We're going to start the third hour here in a few minutes and we're going to take calls.
[00:45:29.303 --> 00:45:32.083]  Jason, Stuart, Tim, Joe, Pat and many others.
[00:45:32.083 --> 00:45:33.584]  The toll free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:45:33.584 --> 00:45:38.005]  We're going to cycle through your calls quickly.
[00:45:38.005 --> 00:45:43.507]  We hit that break and you were still going about, because you don't have your headset on yet.
[00:45:43.507 --> 00:45:44.467]  We'll do that when you take the calls.
[00:45:45.413 --> 00:45:51.017]  We hit that break and you were still going about the Second Amendment and using the Kennesaw, Georgia example?
[00:45:51.017 --> 00:45:51.877]  Right.
[00:45:51.877 --> 00:45:53.018]  I was just contrasting.
[00:45:53.018 --> 00:45:57.181]  All the cities that have gun control have high crime.
[00:45:57.181 --> 00:46:07.368]  Kennesaw, Georgia is a small town just northwest of Atlanta and several years ago they passed a law that requires a homeowner to have a gun.
[00:46:07.368 --> 00:46:15.093]  Now they've never arrested anybody for not having a gun but it was interesting that as soon as they passed this law saying that homeowners have to have a gun
[00:46:15.633 --> 00:46:19.696]  Home invasions in that city dropped by 90 percent.
[00:46:19.696 --> 00:46:23.179]  Nobody's crawling through anybody's window anymore because you could get hurt.
[00:46:23.179 --> 00:46:28.142]  By the way, I've had their police chief on, I've had their mayor on, and that's true.
[00:46:28.142 --> 00:46:31.444]  It was actually, I believe, 92 percent.
[00:46:31.444 --> 00:46:37.229]  So it's even better, and the only reason I know that is because we have a section on the website about it.
[00:46:37.229 --> 00:46:44.073]  But imagine, they were having a crime wave because all the crime was coming in from Atlanta, and now it's non-existent.
[00:46:44.073 --> 00:46:44.814]  I mean, it's simple.
[00:46:45.558 --> 00:46:47.319]  Take Texas here.
[00:46:47.319 --> 00:46:50.581]  The criminals go into the inner city areas where they know people aren't armed.
[00:46:50.581 --> 00:46:54.343]  They would never try to just go into somebody's house when people are there.
[00:46:54.343 --> 00:46:56.804]  It's very rare because you do that, you die.
[00:46:56.804 --> 00:46:57.565]  Absolutely.
[00:46:57.565 --> 00:47:07.931]  I mean, you know, right here in this safe next to me, I've got it's a safe so nobody can get into it but me, I mean, right now somebody comes in here and tries to harm me or my staff, it's bye-bye.
[00:47:07.931 --> 00:47:09.492]  And that's not a bad thing.
[00:47:09.492 --> 00:47:10.392]  That's good.
[00:47:10.392 --> 00:47:11.453]  It's a good thing.
[00:47:11.453 --> 00:47:13.634]  Everybody has a survival instinct.
[00:47:14.432 --> 00:47:19.554]  I talked to women who say they would do anything to protect their children.
[00:47:19.554 --> 00:47:27.418]  And I said, well, if you have someone crawling through the window at 2 o'clock in the morning with a bloody machete, would you take a gun and use it to protect your children?
[00:47:27.418 --> 00:47:29.859]  They said, oh no, that's dangerous.
[00:47:29.859 --> 00:47:33.620]  Well then, clearly, you would not do anything to protect your children.
[00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:39.783]  Why would you give up the one tool that would allow you to protect your children efficiently and safely?
[00:47:40.103 --> 00:47:41.304]  Well, that's the crazy thing.
[00:47:41.304 --> 00:47:48.049]  There was the famous case five years ago, and I mean, these cases we see every week, but I interviewed some of the family and people involved as they cried on air.
[00:47:48.049 --> 00:47:51.492]  Remember the pitchfork murderer in Central California?
[00:47:51.492 --> 00:47:58.137]  He was the next-door neighbor, but he went crazy in a middle-class neighborhood, and the 14-year-old girl was a championship shooter.
[00:47:58.137 --> 00:47:58.758]  Yes.
[00:47:58.758 --> 00:48:00.219]  I mean, she was getting ready for the Olympics.
[00:48:00.219 --> 00:48:01.980]  I mean, they were grooming her for that.
[00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:04.222]  I mean, she was, you know, 100 yards, bullseye every time.
[00:48:05.002 --> 00:48:13.328]  And he ran around for like 30 minutes with a blunt, wasn't even a sharp pitchfork, stabbing the toddler and stabbing the five-year-old.
[00:48:13.328 --> 00:48:17.811]  She tried to get into the safe, but under the law, she wasn't allowed to have the safe number.
[00:48:17.811 --> 00:48:22.554]  Under the law, it had to be locked up, and it was in a big safe, and she didn't know the code.
[00:48:22.554 --> 00:48:25.596]  And, you know, with an instant access pistol safe, I can get in there in three seconds.
[00:48:25.596 --> 00:48:30.579]  Well, she couldn't get in, and she had to leave, and I think he killed her three siblings.
[00:48:30.579 --> 00:48:33.982]  She went next door to a neighbor, I believe, and got help from the neighbor.
[00:48:33.982 --> 00:48:34.222]  Yes.
[00:48:34.922 --> 00:48:41.325]  But again, the government tries to pass laws that are, you know, one size fits all.
[00:48:41.325 --> 00:48:45.747]  And as individuals, we all know that, you know, we don't all fit the same mold.
[00:48:46.607 --> 00:48:49.187]  Well, you've got to really be domesticated to be afraid of guns.
[00:48:49.187 --> 00:48:53.688]  I mean, that was the norm in this country, and now people are scared to death of them.
[00:48:53.688 --> 00:49:03.270]  Well, our country, the United States, started in 1775 when the King's police officers came to confiscate our guns at Lexington and Concord.
[00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:07.871]  And Texas' revolution started in Gonzales over gun confiscation.
[00:49:07.871 --> 00:49:08.391]  Absolutely.
[00:49:08.391 --> 00:49:13.892]  The Mexican army tried to take our cannon, and we wrote up a quick flag that said, come and take it.
[00:49:14.512 --> 00:49:16.973]  And we kicked their behind.
[00:49:16.973 --> 00:49:17.994]  So, we'll be right back.
[00:49:17.994 --> 00:49:18.474]  We've got a break.
[00:49:18.474 --> 00:49:20.275]  We're starting the third hour.

[00:49:32.077 --> 00:49:33.458]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:49:33.458 --> 00:49:36.499]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:49:36.499 --> 00:49:41.080]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:42.220]  So what do you do?
[00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:46.802]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:49:47.282 --> 00:49:49.905]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:49:49.905 --> 00:49:51.187]  Sheltering in place.
[00:49:51.187 --> 00:49:55.231]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.
[00:49:55.231 --> 00:50:01.879]  Developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases,

[00:50:44.681 --> 00:50:46.001]  Big Brother.
[00:50:46.001 --> 00:50:47.762]  Mainstream media.
[00:50:47.762 --> 00:50:48.923]  Government cover-ups.
[00:50:48.923 --> 00:50:51.085]  You want answers?
[00:50:51.085 --> 00:50:52.666]  Well, so does he.
[00:50:52.666 --> 00:50:56.828]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:50:56.828 --> 00:51:00.891]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:51:04.361 --> 00:51:05.502]  We're good to go.
[00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:24.762]  Well, hello ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:24.762 --> 00:51:29.207]  We're back live now in the third and final hour, and in a few minutes we're going to go to your phone calls.
[00:51:29.207 --> 00:51:36.215]  We're talking to a man who's running against the installed Republican, Michael McCaul, who's Republican in name only.
[00:51:36.215 --> 00:51:37.517]  I think they call those rhinos.
[00:51:37.517 --> 00:51:41.702]  He was Janet Reno's confidant, her attack dog, her minion who protected her on Chinagate.
[00:51:42.282 --> 00:51:46.723]  Waco, and just so many other horrible things.
[00:51:46.723 --> 00:51:58.466]  And Constitutional Scholar Michael Bagnerik is running against him in place 10 to be another Ron Paul for us, hailing from the great state of Texas.
[00:51:58.466 --> 00:52:02.928]  So he is here with us in studio now for another 20 minutes or so.
[00:52:02.928 --> 00:52:11.430]  I want to go to these calls, but Michael, any other points or issues you want to cover on the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and where America's going right now?
[00:52:13.663 --> 00:52:17.047]  I think that people need to read the Constitution and understand it.
[00:52:17.047 --> 00:52:19.309]  I've written a book to make that all easier.
[00:52:19.309 --> 00:52:21.932]  The name of the book is Good to be King.
[00:52:21.932 --> 00:52:24.815]  You can get that at Amazon.com and other bookstores.
[00:52:24.815 --> 00:52:27.258]  It lays out things in very simple terms.
[00:52:27.258 --> 00:52:28.499]  To show how I'm out of the loop.
[00:52:28.499 --> 00:52:29.060]  I want that.
[00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:30.561]  Can I get a big discount and carry it?
[00:52:30.561 --> 00:52:31.342]  Absolutely.
[00:52:31.342 --> 00:52:32.964]  I mean, I've got a video on Bookstore right here.
[00:52:32.964 --> 00:52:34.165]  Absolutely.
[00:52:34.165 --> 00:52:34.746]  Give me a copy.
[00:52:34.746 --> 00:52:35.487]  I'm sure it's excellent.
[00:52:36.728 --> 00:52:38.829]  Tell us about Good to Be King.
[00:52:38.829 --> 00:52:40.690]  It starts out with just the basic premise.
[00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:41.911]  It starts out with Mel Brooks?
[00:52:41.911 --> 00:52:43.051]  No, no, no, no.
[00:52:43.051 --> 00:52:46.333]  I did not, I've never seen, well I did see the Mel Brooks movie.
[00:52:46.333 --> 00:52:47.774]  I'm being sarcastic, I'm joking.
[00:52:47.774 --> 00:52:49.434]  Go ahead, go ahead.
[00:52:49.434 --> 00:52:52.416]  The idea is, why do we need any government at all?
[00:52:55.518 --> 00:53:02.241]  Did the Founding Fathers get together and say, you know, the birds are singing, the crops are good, and everything is... It was a limited government just to protect our property.
[00:53:02.241 --> 00:53:03.262]  Absolutely.
[00:53:03.262 --> 00:53:04.562]  So... From other governments.
[00:53:04.562 --> 00:53:08.184]  We go through what, why this form of government?
[00:53:08.184 --> 00:53:12.706]  Why not communism or socialism or some other version?
[00:53:12.706 --> 00:53:14.547]  Why a constitutional republic?
[00:53:15.027 --> 00:53:16.288]  Well, it's real simple.
[00:53:16.288 --> 00:53:19.091]  Bush gets up and says, I'm commander in chief so I can rob banks.
[00:53:31.343 --> 00:53:31.583]  I think?
[00:53:50.249 --> 00:53:52.211]  But then you go look at it, what, Article 2?
[00:53:52.211 --> 00:53:53.812]  Is it Section 2 of Article 2?
[00:53:53.812 --> 00:53:56.955]  Where it says the Commander-in-Chief has to follow the Constitution.
[00:53:56.955 --> 00:53:58.656]  It's not domestically.
[00:53:58.656 --> 00:54:01.598]  He can't violate any of the Bill of Rights.
[00:54:01.598 --> 00:54:05.882]  It's so limited, but the average person doesn't know what Article 2, Section 2 is.
[00:54:05.882 --> 00:54:19.152]  Well, when the President or anybody else, any other government agent, takes an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, they don't go to the National Archive, you know, once a month and stand in front of the document and make sure nobody gets a smudge mark on it.
[00:54:20.266 --> 00:54:22.987]  What they are defending is not the physical piece of paper.
[00:54:22.987 --> 00:54:25.688]  They are defending the ideals.
[00:54:25.688 --> 00:54:26.769]  Your private property.
[00:54:26.769 --> 00:54:30.070]  That's the purpose of taking that oath of office.
[00:54:30.070 --> 00:54:31.150]  Oh, you're absolutely right.
[00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:32.051]  I mean, that's what it is.
[00:54:32.051 --> 00:54:32.331]  Period.
[00:54:32.995 --> 00:54:38.957]  So, and as soon as more and more of our friends and fellow Americans wake up to that fact, I do.
[00:54:38.957 --> 00:54:40.337]  I am very optimistic.
[00:54:40.337 --> 00:54:42.678]  I see things changing.
[00:54:42.678 --> 00:54:45.899]  People are starting to understand.
[00:54:45.899 --> 00:54:50.620]  And we're going to work very, very hard to win this election in District 10.
[00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:52.260]  Well, you know, I've been a pessimist.
[00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:53.601]  I've been doing this now for 12 years.
[00:54:53.601 --> 00:54:57.182]  I've been a pessimist in the past, the last four or five years, and now even more and more.
[00:54:58.144 --> 00:55:02.888]  I am really, it's always dark as before the dawn, for every action there's an equal or greater reaction.
[00:55:02.888 --> 00:55:05.310]  All those clichés play in here.
[00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:12.696]  I mean, literally my message, because it's genuine, it's backed up with fact, everything we cover every day is on the website.
[00:55:12.696 --> 00:55:16.118]  But still, I'm not even the best at delivering a message.
[00:55:16.118 --> 00:55:24.325]  I've likened it to selling a life wrap to somebody who's in freezing waters, or my usual analogy is snow cones in hell.
[00:55:24.325 --> 00:55:26.366]  I mean, people really are starting to get it.
[00:55:26.366 --> 00:55:26.867]  Yes, they are.
[00:55:27.507 --> 00:55:29.849]  And I'm very hopeful for that.
[00:55:29.849 --> 00:55:33.553]  I want to get your prediction of when we're going to really overturn this corrupt system.
[00:55:33.553 --> 00:55:35.254]  Or will it be more of a gradual thing?
[00:55:35.254 --> 00:55:36.895]  And we'll take your calls, I promise.
[00:55:36.895 --> 00:55:39.037]  On the other side, stay with us right here on GCN.
[00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:44.584]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:55:44.584 --> 00:55:46.486]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:55:46.486 --> 00:55:51.492]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:55:51.492 --> 00:55:56.378]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:55:56.378 --> 00:56:00.523]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:56:00.743 --> 00:56:03.684]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:56:03.684 --> 00:56:08.545]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:56:08.545 --> 00:56:13.186]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:56:13.186 --> 00:56:20.648]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:56:20.648 --> 00:56:23.249]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:56:23.249 --> 00:56:25.069]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[00:56:41.815 --> 00:56:46.679]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:56:46.679 --> 00:56:51.043]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:56:51.043 --> 00:56:51.904]  We listened.
[00:56:51.904 --> 00:56:57.169]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:56:57.169 --> 00:56:58.050]  We listened.
[00:56:58.050 --> 00:57:01.493]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:57:01.493 --> 00:57:02.514]  We listened.
[00:57:02.514 --> 00:57:05.236]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and
[00:57:05.316 --> 00:57:05.696]  I think so.
[00:57:32.387 --> 00:57:33.408]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[00:57:33.408 --> 00:57:34.809]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:57:40.973 --> 00:57:47.555]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:57:47.555 --> 00:57:52.897]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:57:52.897 --> 00:58:00.940]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:07.983]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:58:08.203 --> 00:58:09.565]  There are no side effects.
[00:58:09.565 --> 00:58:13.009]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:58:13.009 --> 00:58:14.431]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:58:14.431 --> 00:58:15.913]  Eliminate the cause.
[00:58:15.913 --> 00:58:22.862]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:58:22.862 --> 00:58:25.265]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[00:58:28.486 --> 00:58:29.466]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:58:29.466 --> 00:58:32.867]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:49.182 --> 00:59:03.142]  Michael Bagnerik, he was a presidential candidate for the Libertarians, one of their more fiery elections in 2004, was basically kidnapped in one of the debates, just for even being near the sacred building trying to get in.
[00:59:04.208 --> 00:59:07.710]  And they are the only real big third party in this country.
[00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:14.274]  How many elected public servants who are Libertarians are in high office right now?
[00:59:14.274 --> 00:59:17.816]  Well, we have 650, I think, nationwide.
[00:59:17.816 --> 00:59:20.338]  I'm very excited about the 2006 election.
[00:59:20.338 --> 00:59:27.522]  It's an unofficial number, but I think we're going to have about 187 Libertarian candidates on the ballot in Texas.
[00:59:28.172 --> 00:59:29.273]  And it just keeps growing.
[00:59:29.273 --> 00:59:31.755]  I mean, you guys are... it's almost exponential.
[00:59:31.755 --> 00:59:32.496]  Yes, it is.
[00:59:32.496 --> 00:59:34.698]  And I'm very excited about that.
[00:59:34.698 --> 00:59:35.919]  Well, I'm excited about it, too.
[00:59:35.919 --> 00:59:37.460]  And, you know, libertarians are a diverse crowd.
[00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:42.025]  They run the gamut from what you could call liberal libertarians to very conservative libertarians.
[00:59:42.025 --> 00:59:43.126]  What would you call a Ron Paul?
[00:59:43.126 --> 00:59:45.468]  I'd call him kind of a conservative libertarian.
[00:59:46.825 --> 00:59:48.186]  I just call him a libertarian.
[00:59:48.186 --> 00:59:55.689]  I mean, he ran as a Republican, but he is a strict constitutional libertarian.
[00:59:55.689 --> 01:00:01.031]  He votes no on any legislation which violates the Constitution.
[01:00:01.031 --> 01:00:05.273]  And his nickname in Congress, as your listeners probably know, is Dr. No.
[01:00:07.314 --> 01:00:18.649]  I believe there are over 200 bills where 434 people voted in favor of it and one person, Ron Paul, voted against it.
[01:00:18.649 --> 01:00:21.793]  No, he really does do that because we don't need more laws.
[01:00:21.793 --> 01:00:23.476]  How many millions of laws are there?
[01:00:24.957 --> 01:00:30.099]  I mean, I could see 200 years ago saying ignorance of the law is no excuse because there was only a couple hundred laws.
[01:00:30.099 --> 01:00:31.480]  And it was pretty common sense stuff.
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:33.821]  Don't steal, don't rape, don't embezzle.
[01:00:33.821 --> 01:00:37.583]  Now, no one can follow all the laws.
[01:00:37.583 --> 01:00:40.164]  Quite frankly, when I ran, just for a few weeks for Congress,
[01:00:41.056 --> 01:00:44.499]  I don't know that it's impossible, but it is definitely difficult.
[01:00:44.499 --> 01:00:46.922]  And we have somebody on our campaign whose job it is to just read and understand the FEC rules.
[01:01:04.213 --> 01:01:08.717]  So, you know, we have one person dedicated to keeping us out of trouble.
[01:01:08.717 --> 01:01:13.120]  And up on InfoWars.com is a link to the website, and he needs national support for this.
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:18.704]  Another congressman like Ron Paul, and McNair has got a good record, folks, so I think you should support him.
[01:01:18.704 --> 01:01:21.687]  Jason in Maryland, you're on the air with Michael McNair.
[01:01:21.687 --> 01:01:21.967]  Go ahead.
[01:01:22.785 --> 01:01:25.787]  Hello Alex, thanks and hello Michael.
[01:01:25.787 --> 01:01:36.194]  I was wondering if you could speak about the more serious charges, if you are aware of them, I'm sure you are, against this administration.
[01:01:36.194 --> 01:01:42.518]  Specifically the charges of taking the country to war under false pretense and fabricated intel.
[01:01:43.238 --> 01:01:48.842]  Yeah, it's part of the record that they fabricated the intelligence, that they premeditatedly lie, they've been caught red-handed.
[01:01:48.842 --> 01:01:50.003]  What's your take on that?
[01:01:50.003 --> 01:01:53.345]  But we haven't had a declared war since World War II.
[01:01:53.345 --> 01:01:56.367]  And there's a reason, because they've got to follow rules when they do that.
[01:01:56.367 --> 01:01:57.007]  That's right.
[01:01:57.007 --> 01:02:02.791]  So, Korea, Vietnam, all these aggressions are outside the Constitution.
[01:02:02.791 --> 01:02:04.412]  They're police actions.
[01:02:04.412 --> 01:02:06.254]  We just watched the Rose Bowl last night.
[01:02:06.254 --> 01:02:12.778]  What do you think would have happened if the referee had given somebody a touchdown when their feet were outside, you know, the boundaries?
[01:02:13.098 --> 01:02:14.939]  I mean, there would have been a national riot.
[01:02:14.939 --> 01:02:19.821]  There would have been a riot, because if you're going to play football, you gotta play by the rules.
[01:02:19.821 --> 01:02:24.983]  Well, if you're gonna play international country, you have rules to live by, and that's called the U.S.
[01:02:24.983 --> 01:02:25.503]  Constitution.
[01:02:25.503 --> 01:02:28.685]  And the minute, I mean, if some banana republic doesn't follow a rule, that's one thing.
[01:02:28.685 --> 01:02:35.087]  The whole world is saying, we can preemptively attack people, we can torture, we can break the law, we can spy on people.
[01:02:35.087 --> 01:02:40.790]  Instead of being a beacon of light now, China's going, hey, we're gonna have more Tiananmen Squares than they just did a month ago, because you're having them.
[01:02:41.210 --> 01:02:41.850]  Yeah.
[01:02:41.850 --> 01:02:49.112]  So, you know, what I want is I want our representatives in Washington to follow and understand the Constitution.
[01:02:49.112 --> 01:02:51.592]  Well, I understand all of that.
[01:02:51.592 --> 01:02:54.533]  Would you move for Lord Bush's impeachment if you were in Congress?
[01:02:54.533 --> 01:02:55.313]  Hello?
[01:02:55.313 --> 01:02:56.473]  Yes, Jason, we hear you.
[01:02:56.473 --> 01:03:06.135]  Yes, all of this is well said, but I'm speaking specifically about the charges filed by a prosecutor in Chicago about
[01:03:06.895 --> 01:03:11.126]  You know, the foreknowledge and fabricated intel and the...
[01:03:13.563 --> 01:03:16.745]  The whole 9-11, everything Alex... Sir, that's not true.
[01:03:16.745 --> 01:03:21.048]  That's disinfo that there's been all these indictments filed against Bush and people for that.
[01:03:21.048 --> 01:03:21.889]  It's not true.
[01:03:21.889 --> 01:03:23.430]  It's definitely not true.
[01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:24.631]  Yes, it's not true.
[01:03:24.631 --> 01:03:25.231]  Oh, okay.
[01:03:25.231 --> 01:03:26.012]  Thank you.
[01:03:26.012 --> 01:03:26.632]  You bet.
[01:03:26.632 --> 01:03:27.693]  I appreciate the call.
[01:03:27.693 --> 01:03:38.360]  I mean, I just... You know, we watch that, we watch those people make those claims, and now I'm just sure... I was sure of it at the time when we set it, but I mean, it's just... No, Scooter Libby's been indicted.
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:40.962]  Scooter Libby has been indicted.
[01:03:40.962 --> 01:03:42.243]  No one else has been indicted.
[01:03:43.524 --> 01:03:46.830]  Well, other than like Abramoff, but that's a separate situation.
[01:03:46.830 --> 01:03:48.554]  He's pled guilty to conspiracy.
[01:03:48.554 --> 01:03:49.976]  Government's doing things wrong, Michael?
[01:03:54.025 --> 01:03:55.326]  I have to laugh.
[01:03:55.326 --> 01:04:00.910]  I mean, the whole idea of, you know, the government telling the truth is kind of a surprise anymore.
[01:04:00.910 --> 01:04:07.074]  Yeah, well, it gets attention when congressmen or women get up there and, you know, call for impeachment or call for people to get in trouble.
[01:04:07.074 --> 01:04:09.736]  I mean, what should our Iraq exit strategy be?
[01:04:09.736 --> 01:04:12.278]  What would your Iraq policy be?
[01:04:12.278 --> 01:04:17.021]  I would try to bring our soldiers home as safely and quickly as possible.
[01:04:17.021 --> 01:04:19.103]  We really shouldn't have been there in the first place.
[01:04:20.076 --> 01:04:25.639]  The longer we stay there, the higher our terrorism threat goes up.
[01:04:25.639 --> 01:04:31.723]  I would not make a plan to pull them out in one day, because that's physically impossible.
[01:04:31.723 --> 01:04:37.986]  If I were president, I would give my military commanders the instructions to... A controlled exit!
[01:04:37.986 --> 01:04:39.607]  We could be totally out of there in two months!
[01:04:39.927 --> 01:04:41.348]  You know, and let's do it.
[01:04:41.348 --> 01:04:46.310]  You know, we've got to get out, we've got to stop tampering with the Middle East.
[01:04:46.310 --> 01:04:49.512]  Well, let's face it, they're building six giant permanent bases.
[01:04:50.234 --> 01:04:52.736]  The size of small cities, and then nobody's leaving.
[01:04:52.736 --> 01:04:53.977]  We'll be there in 50 years.
[01:04:53.977 --> 01:04:54.157]  Right.
[01:04:54.157 --> 01:04:56.378]  I mean, Cheney said 20 years.
[01:04:56.378 --> 01:05:01.962]  Well, World War II has been over with for over 50 years, and we don't have an exit strategy for Germany or Japan.
[01:05:01.962 --> 01:05:03.463]  Notice how they keep lying, too.
[01:05:03.463 --> 01:05:06.244]  They just keep going, well, it'll be another year, it'll be another year.
[01:05:06.244 --> 01:05:08.226]  They told the troops, you'll be home by Christmas.
[01:05:08.226 --> 01:05:09.667]  The road to home is Baghdad.
[01:05:09.667 --> 01:05:12.729]  By the way, in World War II, they'd only make you do one tour 11 months.
[01:05:12.729 --> 01:05:14.090]  Vietnam, 11 months.
[01:05:14.090 --> 01:05:15.030]  They knew you'd break down.
[01:05:15.030 --> 01:05:15.971]  Napoleon knew that.
[01:05:17.171 --> 01:05:18.812]  Hitler knew that, and that's why he finally failed.
[01:05:18.812 --> 01:05:21.032]  He tried to make his soldiers do three tours.
[01:05:21.032 --> 01:05:26.614]  They're now starting their fourth tour, because some were there a year before the invasion, and that's very stressful.
[01:05:26.614 --> 01:05:35.717]  But we've got three tours coming up, three 11s, almost three years coming up here very soon, and now there's debate.
[01:05:35.717 --> 01:05:38.938]  Well, the soldiers are wimps having post-traumatic stress disorder.
[01:05:39.618 --> 01:05:43.982]  I mean, this is serious low-intensity conflict, raiding houses every day.
[01:05:43.982 --> 01:05:48.006]  I mean, imagine if the SWAT team had to do ten raids a day for three years.
[01:05:48.006 --> 01:05:52.890]  I mean, the SWAT teams can't do two raids a week without having post-traumatic stress.
[01:05:52.890 --> 01:05:55.973]  No one has ever flushed our troops down the toilet like this.
[01:05:55.973 --> 01:06:03.280]  I feel so strongly for our troops, and we need to bring them home so they can be with their families for the holidays and stuff.
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:03.960]  I agree.
[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:04.901]  Stewart in Texas.
[01:06:04.901 --> 01:06:05.542]  Stewart, go ahead.
[01:06:06.022 --> 01:06:06.262]  Great.
[01:06:06.262 --> 01:06:08.863]  Three quick comments and I'll hang up.
[01:06:08.863 --> 01:06:12.145]  Michael, you mentioned ending the IRS, but that's not the answer.
[01:06:12.145 --> 01:06:15.647]  They're just going to bring in something more controlling and worse.
[01:06:15.647 --> 01:06:18.168]  Yeah, a dual sales tax along with it will be just as bad.
[01:06:18.168 --> 01:06:18.548]  Right.
[01:06:18.548 --> 01:06:19.208]  I agree.
[01:06:19.208 --> 01:06:23.210]  It was just an example of what you could do with the money if the government wasn't taking it.
[01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:24.030]  Okay.
[01:06:24.030 --> 01:06:31.734]  And the McCall family, I've met these individuals and, well, their family owns the voting machines.
[01:06:31.734 --> 01:06:33.955]  And as a frustrated libertarian,
[01:06:35.133 --> 01:06:39.475]  Uh, I don't know if you need to get together with the Democrats that are running and kind of point that out.
[01:06:39.475 --> 01:06:41.957]  Yeah, they're part of it, see, they want to keep all that quiet.
[01:06:41.957 --> 01:06:47.239]  Okay, last thing is... Because in some areas they control those, those little special machines.
[01:06:47.239 --> 01:06:48.560]  Right, yeah, I guess that's true.
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:50.401]  By the way, folks, that's really true.
[01:06:50.401 --> 01:06:51.922]  His family really does own the machines.
[01:06:52.623 --> 01:06:58.006]  Okay, and I've taken your Constitution class, I've got your book, it's great, I recommend it for everybody listening, it's just terrific stuff.
[01:06:58.006 --> 01:06:58.406]  My frustration
[01:07:15.775 --> 01:07:19.518]  With the Libertarians, they won't speak out on the Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:07:19.518 --> 01:07:25.202]  They won't speak out on the 9-11 cover-up and the inside job going on there.
[01:07:25.202 --> 01:07:36.390]  We keep just running around the same stuff and it's all good, but we're not... Americans are shallow people for the most part when it comes to the Constitution.
[01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:38.211]  Are you going to speak out on 9-11 in Oklahoma?
[01:07:38.211 --> 01:07:38.711]  Well, yeah.
[01:07:38.711 --> 01:07:40.733]  I think I'll put it this way, and thanks for the call, Stuart.
[01:07:40.733 --> 01:07:41.393]  I'll put it this way.
[01:07:41.393 --> 01:07:44.075]  We had the CIA commander
[01:07:45.018 --> 01:07:45.679]  I don't think so.
[01:08:04.322 --> 01:08:07.204]  I mean, people may have known 30 years ago, but now it's public.
[01:08:07.204 --> 01:08:08.225]  All of that's out there.
[01:08:08.225 --> 01:08:11.127]  Will you ever discuss those issues or talk about those issues?
[01:08:11.127 --> 01:08:16.151]  Because Ray McGovern will come on, Chief CIA Advisor to Ronald Reagan, and say it.
[01:08:16.151 --> 01:08:20.595]  The former CIA head will come out and say stuff like this now.
[01:08:20.595 --> 01:08:22.176]  NSA people are going public.
[01:08:22.176 --> 01:08:23.417]  So many prominent people.
[01:08:24.397 --> 01:08:30.020]  Paul Craig Roberts, who was number two at Treasury, the chief economist for Bush.
[01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:36.862]  This current Bush, in his last administration, has been on Morgan Reynolds and talked about 9-11 clearly being an inside job.
[01:08:36.862 --> 01:08:43.665]  I mean, obviously, you talk about that here on air, they can use that against you on TV, but any signal to the people out there?
[01:08:43.665 --> 01:08:44.705]  Anything?
[01:08:44.705 --> 01:08:51.228]  I'm going to be going and talking with the people, shaking hands with them and letting them know that when I give you an answer, it is not political rhetoric.
[01:08:51.864 --> 01:08:53.785]  I want to go to Washington, D.C.
[01:08:53.785 --> 01:08:58.086]  and represent not only the people in District 10, but the people in the United States.
[01:08:58.086 --> 01:09:01.607]  Let's say the Defense Department sets off a nuke tomorrow and starts arresting everybody.
[01:09:01.607 --> 01:09:04.248]  Do you realize how close we are, Michael?
[01:09:04.248 --> 01:09:05.509]  This is not a joke.
[01:09:05.509 --> 01:09:09.530]  I do understand that things are critical, but I'm also very optimistic.
[01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:14.012]  People are understanding that the government is not following the Constitution.
[01:09:14.012 --> 01:09:17.013]  They are abusing their authority.
[01:09:17.013 --> 01:09:21.194]  So you're saying they've lost so much trust now that you think they're losing even more control?
[01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:35.679]  I think that the people, specifically, you know, across the United States, but hopefully in District 10, have lost confidence in the government, and that they are at the point where they are willing to vote for someone other than a Democrat or a Republican.
[01:09:35.679 --> 01:09:40.702]  I don't think that they're going to feel like they are wasting their vote when they cast a ballot for me.
[01:09:40.702 --> 01:09:46.406]  But the question is, let's say you go to a meeting here in Austin, and I know half the people bring up 9-11 inside job to you.
[01:09:46.406 --> 01:09:51.729]  If people bring that up, are you going to say, my constituents are concerned about the cover-up of 9-11 and want a real investigation?
[01:09:52.748 --> 01:09:56.312]  If my constituents tell me that they're concerned about that, yes, I'll bring it up.
[01:09:56.312 --> 01:10:01.218]  Maybe you could start a committee up there and call the people in.
[01:10:01.218 --> 01:10:04.082]  It could be, have you ever or are you ever involved in 9-11?
[01:10:04.082 --> 01:10:10.649]  Yeah, but what I'm really trying to do is just get the base support from, you know... I understand.
[01:10:10.649 --> 01:10:11.651]  You're trying to get step one.
[01:10:11.651 --> 01:10:12.291]  You're trying to win.
[01:10:13.490 --> 01:10:14.531]  I mean, look, it's like Ron Paul.
[01:10:14.531 --> 01:10:28.200]  I've got him here on the show, and he'll say everything up to that point, and he won't say that, because they've already had TV ads with his head floating around Jupiter, saying, he's from outer space, he's a... Just wink at me, and you know it's true.
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:29.060]  Oh, we got him!
[01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:31.642]  All right.
[01:10:31.642 --> 01:10:33.703]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:10:33.703 --> 01:10:35.745]  Listen, do one more five-minute segment with me.
[01:10:35.745 --> 01:10:38.347]  I know you've got to go, but one more, because I've got a few more calls here for you.
[01:10:38.347 --> 01:10:38.687]  Stay with us.
[01:10:41.391 --> 01:10:46.214]  Did you know that heart disease is the number one killer of men and women in the United States?
[01:10:46.214 --> 01:10:55.721]  In fact, the National Cholesterol Education Program has reported that each year more than a million Americans have heart attacks and about a half a million die from heart disease.
[01:10:55.721 --> 01:11:01.685]  Did you also know that the higher your blood cholesterol level, the greater your risk for developing heart disease or having a heart attack?
[01:11:02.285 --> 01:11:21.629]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we are aware of the controversies surrounding the presumed safety of statin drugs in lowering cholesterol, which is why, as part of our ongoing commitment to your safety and health, we invite you to learn more about Google by Himalaya, a highly effective and extremely safe natural herbal supplement, widely recognized for its cholesterol-regulating properties.

[01:11:32.411 --> 01:11:33.371]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[01:11:33.371 --> 01:11:34.091]  One and the same.
[01:11:50.134 --> 01:11:54.135]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:11:54.135 --> 01:11:56.215]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:11:56.215 --> 01:11:56.756]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:11:56.756 --> 01:11:58.536]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:11:58.536 --> 01:11:59.016]  Here is reality.
[01:11:59.016 --> 01:12:01.057]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:20.104]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:12:20.104 --> 01:12:24.307]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[01:12:24.307 --> 01:12:28.030]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.

[01:13:28.985 --> 01:13:30.086]  You don't love me anymore?
[01:13:30.086 --> 01:13:31.486]  You used to take such good care of me.
[01:13:31.486 --> 01:13:32.767]  Is that my car talking to me?
[01:13:32.767 --> 01:13:32.987]  Yes.
[01:13:32.987 --> 01:13:33.767]  You neglect me.
[01:13:33.767 --> 01:13:35.408]  Change my oil late most of the time.
[01:13:35.408 --> 01:13:36.609]  Use the cheapest gas.
[01:13:36.609 --> 01:13:37.770]  I'm getting sick.
[01:13:37.770 --> 01:13:40.791]  One of these days, I'm just gonna give up.
[01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:56.880]  Wait a minute.
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.482]  I've got three more years of payments on you.
[01:13:58.482 --> 01:14:07.755]  If you want me to last forever, you need to add protect to engine treatment, protect to transmission treatment, and especially protect to complete fuel system treatment.

[01:14:13.442 --> 01:14:15.984]  Okay, I'll add some Protecta, but you'll have to perform.
[01:14:15.984 --> 01:14:18.185]  How about faster acceleration?
[01:14:18.185 --> 01:14:19.566]  More horsepower?
[01:14:19.566 --> 01:14:20.887]  Longer lasting?
[01:14:20.887 --> 01:14:22.728]  I'll always be there for you.
[01:14:22.728 --> 01:14:26.231]  So if you want more, treat it right with Protecta by SFR.

[01:14:52.555 --> 01:14:58.862]  All right, I'm going to get into Building 7 and I'm going to the new developments there, big developments, and a bunch of other news.
[01:14:58.862 --> 01:15:00.924]  In the last 30 minutes, we won't even take calls.
[01:15:00.924 --> 01:15:04.607]  Well, I might take a few that have been holding, but there's a lot coming up.
[01:15:04.607 --> 01:15:06.990]  But we've kept Michael Bagnerik for one more segment.
[01:15:06.990 --> 01:15:08.071]  We really appreciate him.
[01:15:08.071 --> 01:15:10.033]  And I've been cornering him during the breaks.
[01:15:10.715 --> 01:15:13.940]  I was just talking to his campaign manager saying, I'm telling you, toll roads.
[01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:16.443]  And obviously he's against them, you heard that in the last hour.
[01:15:16.443 --> 01:15:18.947]  But toll roads, toll roads, toll roads.
[01:15:18.947 --> 01:15:24.895]  And the campaign manager was telling me about our good friend Jimmy Vaughn, who's a great friend of the show and a great American who's been fighting it.
[01:15:24.895 --> 01:15:26.958]  You know, the toll roads are even going to take part of his ranch.
[01:15:27.618 --> 01:15:32.603]  And, you know, he was telling me how Jimmy was giving him this hour-long tour of Corridor Watch and Stahl's campaign.
[01:15:32.603 --> 01:15:34.845]  I think you guys need to link up, man.
[01:15:34.845 --> 01:15:41.792]  I mean, I understand you're for the whole Constitution, but I think, I mean, you talk about contributions, support, my two cents.
[01:15:41.792 --> 01:15:47.077]  And I know you're saying you're going to do whatever your constituents are telling you they're most concerned about constitutionally.
[01:15:47.077 --> 01:15:50.120]  I mean, are you getting the feedback that the toll roads of the zeitgeist?
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:51.421]  We haven't gotten that feedback yet.
[01:15:51.601 --> 01:15:54.003]  We're going to be starting our... You're just starting or rolling?
[01:15:54.003 --> 01:15:54.683]  You're just rolling?
[01:15:54.683 --> 01:15:56.205]  Yeah, we've been building the infrastructure.
[01:15:56.205 --> 01:15:57.225]  We've got office space.
[01:15:57.225 --> 01:15:58.226]  We've got staff members.
[01:15:58.226 --> 01:15:59.507]  We've got bumper stickers.
[01:15:59.507 --> 01:16:00.048]  I know how it is.
[01:16:00.048 --> 01:16:01.189]  You've got to build the infrastructure.
[01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:03.010]  We've got the infrastructure built.
[01:16:03.010 --> 01:16:08.454]  I couldn't wait to come back from Christmas break to really get into the campaign.
[01:16:08.454 --> 01:16:09.755]  And now we've got 10 months.
[01:16:09.755 --> 01:16:12.137]  We've got, well, just, yeah, 10 months.
[01:16:12.137 --> 01:16:13.899]  We've been working really hard.
[01:16:13.899 --> 01:16:18.302]  My staff works about 10 to 12 hours a day, and this is early in the campaign.
[01:16:18.322 --> 01:16:21.884]  Well, just up front, I'm lobbying you, and you're going to get used to this when you're in Washington.
[01:16:21.884 --> 01:16:22.705]  I'm grabbing your hand.
[01:16:22.705 --> 01:16:23.606]  Give me your hand.
[01:16:23.606 --> 01:16:24.486]  Give me your hand.
[01:16:24.486 --> 01:16:26.608]  Now, Congressman, I just really need this done.
[01:16:26.608 --> 01:16:28.469]  Listen, I don't want those toll roads.
[01:16:28.469 --> 01:16:29.910]  I want the King of Spain kicked out of here.
[01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:31.491]  I want him kicked out of here.
[01:16:31.491 --> 01:16:32.632]  Alright, alright, that's good.
[01:16:32.632 --> 01:16:35.173]  Here, let me take a few calls here.
[01:16:35.173 --> 01:16:39.416]  Now, out of all these callers, who's up next for our guest?
[01:16:39.416 --> 01:16:41.417]  Tim in Florida, you're on the air, and then Andy.
[01:16:41.417 --> 01:16:43.279]  Go ahead, Tim, quickly, sir.
[01:16:43.279 --> 01:16:44.640]  Hey, great show, Alex.
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:47.762]  Mike, I want to ask you, are you an attorney?
[01:16:48.943 --> 01:16:50.304]  I am not an attorney.
[01:16:50.304 --> 01:16:51.685]  You've never been an attorney?
[01:16:51.685 --> 01:16:54.066]  I have no desire to be an attorney.
[01:16:54.066 --> 01:16:55.027]  Excellent, okay.
[01:16:55.027 --> 01:16:57.788]  Are you a member of the Square?
[01:16:57.788 --> 01:17:00.030]  He wants to know if you're a Mason.
[01:17:00.030 --> 01:17:02.851]  Oh, I didn't even know what he was talking about.
[01:17:02.851 --> 01:17:04.072]  No, I'm not a member of the...
[01:17:04.998 --> 01:17:08.299]  Have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?
[01:17:08.299 --> 01:17:09.099]  No.
[01:17:09.099 --> 01:17:11.119]  Have you ever been visited by aliens?
[01:17:11.119 --> 01:17:20.642]  Tooth fairies, leprechauns... I've been a Boy Scout, a Scoutmaster, an Advanced First Aid Instructor for the Red Cross, but I've never joined any.
[01:17:20.642 --> 01:17:24.002]  Hey, seriously, anything else, Tim?
[01:17:24.002 --> 01:17:25.703]  That's all I wanted to know.
[01:17:25.703 --> 01:17:26.563]  Well, I hope you'll support him.
[01:17:26.563 --> 01:17:27.163]  Are you going to support him?
[01:17:28.152 --> 01:17:29.893]  I don't vote because I'm not in the system.
[01:17:47.311 --> 01:17:48.132]  Is the way to go.
[01:17:48.132 --> 01:17:52.295]  It's like Private Joker is silly and he's ignorant, but he's got guts and guts is enough.
[01:17:52.295 --> 01:17:54.337]  Alright, let's go ahead, and that's me.
[01:17:54.337 --> 01:17:56.859]  Let's go ahead and talk to Andy in Washington.
[01:17:56.859 --> 01:17:58.440]  Andy, last caller for our guest, go ahead.
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:09.088]  Hi Alex, you definitely comment on the abuses of the police in this country, and I've been wanting to bring this up for you for a while, but it seems like a perfect time today considering your guest's constitutional background.
[01:18:09.088 --> 01:18:15.253]  I'm from Washington State and wanted to make a quick comment on the constitutionally protected right to bear arms.
[01:18:15.974 --> 01:18:31.117]  Um, in my state constitution article 1, which is our declaration of rights part section 24, it briefly states, the right to bear arms, the right of the individual citizen to bear arms in defense of himself or the state shall not be impaired, but nothing in this section shall be construed
[01:18:32.008 --> 01:18:44.066]  Yeah, that's because you're a territory, so you're one of the few states that doesn't have it, but under the federal law you do, and under organic law you do.
[01:18:44.066 --> 01:18:46.651]  And so, you know, you've got maximum rights.
[01:18:47.191 --> 01:18:51.595]  Well, and the point that I'm bringing up here, all police in this state work for corporations.
[01:18:51.595 --> 01:18:52.816]  Cities are incorporated.
[01:18:52.816 --> 01:18:57.760]  No, I know, their very law trying to restrict you from having a second amendment actually restricts them.
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:59.382]  Michael, do you want to comment on that?
[01:18:59.382 --> 01:19:00.383]  I agree.
[01:19:00.383 --> 01:19:07.189]  During the presidential campaign I was in Missouri and someone wanted me to confirm or deny that the Missouri Constitution
[01:19:08.570 --> 01:19:11.472]  allowed or didn't allow concealed carry weapons.
[01:19:11.472 --> 01:19:21.158]  I said, I don't know what the Missouri Constitution says, but if it tries to limit your right, then the Missouri Constitution is a violation of your rights and is unconstitutional.
[01:19:21.158 --> 01:19:24.800]  Yeah, see, they can't even change the Constitution and then declare that we don't have rights.
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:30.143]  In Article 9, in 10, it just keeps restating, no, you, it comes from you.
[01:19:30.143 --> 01:19:32.104]  We're just, we're just codifying it.
[01:19:32.104 --> 01:19:32.805]  Right.
[01:19:32.805 --> 01:19:34.766]  We can alter or abolish
[01:19:35.046 --> 01:19:37.149]  Any government which is in violation of our rights.
[01:19:37.149 --> 01:19:41.534]  So, you know... I mean, let's say Adolf Hitler beat America and took over.
[01:19:41.534 --> 01:19:46.240]  I would, you know, I'm sure our forefathers would have been fighting him from the fence rows.
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:51.746]  Just because it's government, you don't have to kneel down and go, oh, oh, oh, and start worshipping it.
[01:19:51.746 --> 01:19:52.087]  That's right.
[01:19:53.165 --> 01:19:59.290]  We need to use your individual thoughts and processes, understand that every individual has rights.
[01:19:59.290 --> 01:20:02.253]  You need to respect other people's rights and then depend on your own.
[01:20:02.253 --> 01:20:06.176]  And you need to get that, you're absolutely right about these cities.
[01:20:06.176 --> 01:20:12.121]  You have these incorporated cities that aren't even really lawful, now trying to absorb the counties that are supreme.
[01:20:12.945 --> 01:20:13.226]  Yes.
[01:20:13.226 --> 01:20:14.366]  And the Sheriff.
[01:20:14.366 --> 01:20:18.049]  Michael, we've got to get you back in here before the campaign ends in ten months.
[01:20:18.049 --> 01:20:20.191]  We'll be watching it, so will the rest of the country.
[01:20:20.191 --> 01:20:20.852]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:20:20.852 --> 01:20:21.812]  Thank you so much, Al.
[01:20:21.812 --> 01:20:22.133]  You bet.
[01:20:22.133 --> 01:20:27.357]  Michael Bagnerik, now running for Congress against Demon McCall in Place 10, deep in the heart of Texas.
[01:20:27.357 --> 01:20:30.619]  Stay with us.
[01:20:30.619 --> 01:20:32.001]  We're on the march.
[01:20:32.001 --> 01:20:34.523]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:20:34.523 --> 01:20:37.205]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
