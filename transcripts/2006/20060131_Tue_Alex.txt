[00:00:05.714 --> 00:00:06.355]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.015 --> 00:00:08.076]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.797 --> 00:00:09.918]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.558 --> 00:00:11.379]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.080]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.701 --> 00:00:17.344]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.864 --> 00:00:21.967]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.314 --> 00:00:31.495]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:31.515 --> 00:00:33.797]  It is the last day of the first month of 2006.
[00:00:34.037 --> 00:00:34.738]  January 31st, 2006.
[00:00:34.898 --> 00:00:38.802]  We're going to be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:52.654 --> 00:01:05.303]  Paul Watson, our British contributor, one of our British contributors, normally joins us every two weeks but he joined Jack Blood last week when Jack Blood was sitting in for me and he'll be joining us today.
[00:01:06.917 --> 00:01:30.869]  from his home in Sheffield, England, and going over just a wide spectrum of geopolitical developments, the good, the bad, and the ugly, and he'll be with us for the full second hour and part of the third hour, and of course we'll have wide open phones today as we defend liberty and resist tyranny.
[00:01:32.344 --> 00:01:47.997]  I've been mentioning how the Communist Chinese have been threatening to nuke us, and every time I start talking about this again, because they're constantly in the news threatening to do it, I get emails saying that I don't like Asians.
[00:01:48.938 --> 00:01:50.419]  Now let me figure this out.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.847]  A foreign country is threatening to kill my family, your family, I don't care whether you happen to be Asian,
[00:02:00.632 --> 00:02:08.279]  Or whether you happen to be African, or you happen to be a Russian, someone who's Slavic, I don't care if you're Inuit, Eskimo.
[00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.202]  I mean, I didn't say I was going to kill your whole family.
[00:02:13.123 --> 00:02:18.247]  The official government of China said, we may preemptively kill you.
[00:02:19.988 --> 00:02:21.149]  Iran hasn't said that.
[00:02:23.111 --> 00:02:27.715]  And every time I talk about it, I get one of these emails, and I have one of them right here.
[00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:31.173]  I think you don't like Asians.
[00:02:31.293 --> 00:02:33.615]  I think that you're jealous of China.
[00:02:34.035 --> 00:02:35.576]  I get these type of emails.
[00:02:36.117 --> 00:02:37.938]  And quite frankly, I'm sick of it.
[00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:44.323]  I don't care what color you are, but if you love Communist Chinese government officials, you need to get out of this country.
[00:02:44.544 --> 00:02:46.125]  You need to leave.
[00:02:47.026 --> 00:03:00.170]  And if you're so brainwashed that you think, as an American, am I standing up and saying no to your leader's threats to kill my whole family, that I'm somehow bad, you've got your head screwed on backwards.
[00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.851]  All right, now I've engaged in that little rant.
[00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:04.791]  I'm going to get into this.
[00:03:05.431 --> 00:03:07.732]  I'm going to read this guy's actual quotes.
[00:03:07.772 --> 00:03:12.073]  Associated Press, London Guardian, Wall Street Journal.
[00:03:12.533 --> 00:03:15.454]  This was just the latest a few months ago.
[00:03:16.812 --> 00:03:18.294]  And then I want to get into Iran.
[00:03:18.454 --> 00:03:20.336]  Referral means end of diplomacy.
[00:03:20.636 --> 00:03:27.343]  They're now saying because it's gone to the UN that that's the end of diplomacy and now it just means military strikes, basically.
[00:03:28.584 --> 00:03:30.225]  So, we'll get into that.
[00:03:30.325 --> 00:03:37.987]  And World Power is one I ran nuclear issue, heard at UN, and I ran it rightfully saying, we're not playing ball on this one.
[00:03:38.507 --> 00:03:44.429]  And there's all of this convulsing and freaking out that's going on on the TV news shows and talk radio.
[00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.670]  Can you believe I ran?
[00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.311]  How dare them?
[00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:52.052]  If our government goes over there and bombs their country.
[00:03:52.972 --> 00:03:56.374]  They're saying they might fight back!
[00:03:57.074 --> 00:04:03.378]  Oh, can you imagine how radical it is that if your country's attacked, you might!
[00:04:04.258 --> 00:04:05.659]  Might fight back!
[00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.940]  It's insane!
[00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:11.002]  It's unheard of!
[00:04:11.862 --> 00:04:14.404]  No, it's total logic, total common sense.
[00:04:14.464 --> 00:04:16.785]  It's the normal response, but, um...
[00:04:19.691 --> 00:04:23.533]  Our thinking processes, I guess, have gotten so warped that it doesn't connect with some Americans.
[00:04:23.573 --> 00:04:25.434]  So we'll get into that.
[00:04:25.714 --> 00:04:38.459]  Meanwhile, the UN, obviously, yesterday at the big Davos World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, re-announced, gave us some more little interesting details about their world taxation systems they want to set up.
[00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:47.923]  So we'll get into the world government issue as well, and just a host of other issues today.
[00:04:49.113 --> 00:04:50.795]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:04:50.855 --> 00:04:57.424]  We'll dive into the Iran situation, the China situation, what's happening with the world taxation, all of it on the other side.
[00:04:57.684 --> 00:04:58.725]  PrisonPlanet.tv and 4Wars.net.
[00:05:02.532 --> 00:05:05.374]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.634 --> 00:05:07.215]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.555 --> 00:05:12.238]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.578 --> 00:05:19.302]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.642 --> 00:05:21.623]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.823 --> 00:05:24.664]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.764 --> 00:05:29.406]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.626 --> 00:05:34.027]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.268 --> 00:05:41.490]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.151]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[00:06:11.808 --> 00:06:23.031]  Black Flurky elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:06:23.371 --> 00:06:29.072]  Nitrates, Nitrites, Radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are no problem.

[00:07:00.983 --> 00:07:09.505]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[00:07:09.705 --> 00:07:11.526]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[00:07:11.726 --> 00:07:12.926]  That's one in four adults.
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:19.343]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it, the American Heart Association calls it the silent killer.
[00:07:19.624 --> 00:07:23.306]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we recognize your concern for your well-being.

[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:07.565]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:07.665 --> 00:08:26.240]  Alright, last day of the first month of 2006.
[00:08:28.684 --> 00:08:29.864]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:32.325]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours and 51 minutes.
[00:08:32.365 --> 00:08:38.587]  We are now smack dab in the middle of the second segment of this live transmission against tyranny.
[00:08:38.707 --> 00:08:57.632]  I went and pulled out one of the most recent official threats by the Communist Chinese government over in China because I've been mentioning in the last few days in relation to Iran and some people I guess were still in denial about it but here it is Chinese general warns of nuclear risk to the United States
[00:09:00.433 --> 00:09:02.514]  Threatens to destroy hundreds of U.S.
[00:09:02.594 --> 00:09:07.876]  cities to turn them into radioactive rubble.
[00:09:08.016 --> 00:09:13.558]  So we'll go over that and illustrate it with Iran's behavior.
[00:09:14.838 --> 00:09:16.879]  Capitulating to everything, letting
[00:09:19.119 --> 00:09:24.663]  The United Nations inspect anywhere they wanted to go, giving up their national sovereignty.
[00:09:24.683 --> 00:09:27.405]  And then the UN said, hey, do us a favor.
[00:09:28.006 --> 00:09:33.150]  While we debate letting you go to the next stage, why don't you freeze
[00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:50.289]  The already authorized parts of your program that we admit are non-weaponized, cannot be used to produce weapons, and that you have an absolute right to have for power and research.
[00:09:50.869 --> 00:09:53.771]  And they said, sure, absolutely, because even the U.N.
[00:09:53.811 --> 00:09:56.913]  inspectors said, no one has ever rolled out the carpet like this.
[00:09:56.933 --> 00:09:58.254]  We can go anywhere, anytime.
[00:09:58.494 --> 00:09:59.455]  They never question us.
[00:09:59.475 --> 00:10:00.656]  We can do whatever we want.
[00:10:02.797 --> 00:10:04.158]  This is the boots on the ground, though.
[00:10:04.478 --> 00:10:19.428]  And so they said, okay, we'll put seals on these facilities, on these reactors we were building, these peaceful reactors, and you can even have video cameras inside of the facilities and on the outside of the facilities, and we won't go in them.
[00:10:20.089 --> 00:10:24.895]  And then they waited about a year for the American people to forget and to get confused.
[00:10:25.295 --> 00:10:27.658]  And the headlines started, they've got nukes!
[00:10:27.738 --> 00:10:28.699]  They've got nukes!
[00:10:28.759 --> 00:10:29.560]  They've got nukes!
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.081]  Headline!
[00:10:30.181 --> 00:10:32.584]  Iran is going to restart their nukes!
[00:10:33.204 --> 00:10:34.446]  They're going to nuke us!
[00:10:34.606 --> 00:10:34.846]  Nuke!
[00:10:34.966 --> 00:10:35.207]  Nuke!
[00:10:35.287 --> 00:10:35.527]  Nuke!
[00:10:35.647 --> 00:10:35.867]  Nuke!
[00:10:35.967 --> 00:10:36.188]  Nuke!
[00:10:36.208 --> 00:10:37.129]  And the average American
[00:10:38.027 --> 00:10:39.188]  I mean, I'm going to be quite frank with you.
[00:10:39.208 --> 00:10:40.809]  He doesn't even know what a nuclear reactor is.
[00:10:40.829 --> 00:10:42.290]  I mean, that's how dumbed down we've gone.
[00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:46.633]  We've gone from being the smartest in the world to being, in international statistics, the dumbest.
[00:10:46.673 --> 00:10:50.955]  Even our own national statistics, comparatively, we're behind every industrialized country.
[00:10:50.975 --> 00:10:53.657]  And last time I checked, 30-plus third-world countries.
[00:10:53.677 --> 00:10:55.138]  I mean, we are a laughingstock.
[00:10:55.558 --> 00:10:56.419]  I'm ashamed of this.
[00:10:56.439 --> 00:10:57.860]  I mean, I don't even claim to be that smart.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.262]  It's just, I know what a peaceful reactor is.
[00:11:01.142 --> 00:11:02.443]  I know where Iran is.
[00:11:02.524 --> 00:11:04.205]  I know of the history of Persia.
[00:11:04.345 --> 00:11:05.406]  I have a pretty good history of it.
[00:11:05.446 --> 00:11:12.652]  I've read quite a few books on the subject, both on modern Persia, what is Iran, and then going back 3,000 years.
[00:11:12.692 --> 00:11:13.793]  I mean, I know quite a bit about it.
[00:11:14.193 --> 00:11:19.497]  And then, but there are these people who can't even find it on a map, but they've got their whole opinion about it, and they go, but they got nukes!
[00:11:20.018 --> 00:11:21.659]  The news said nukes!
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.663]  They've removed the seals on the nuclear bombs,
[00:11:27.466 --> 00:11:28.687]  And they could nuke us!
[00:11:28.747 --> 00:11:32.030]  The same crowd that said Saddam was going to nuke us in 45 minutes, remember that?
[00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:47.143]  They're now saying they could nuke us, they could have a nuke in a week, and then all the CIA and MI6 and even Israel's own newspapers admit from their own government's analysis that they're, well Israel says 3 years, our CIA says 10 years.
[00:11:48.099 --> 00:11:54.545]  If they could have the project out in the open, bring in the thousands of centrifuges.
[00:11:54.605 --> 00:12:00.730]  I mean, it takes huge factories, giant complexes, bigger than most international airports.
[00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:07.515]  I mean, it is a big deal to refine and purify uranium, and even harder to do that with plutonium.
[00:12:07.816 --> 00:12:10.238]  I mean, it is a mammoth project.
[00:12:10.298 --> 00:12:12.459]  It is muy grande.
[00:12:14.021 --> 00:12:16.543]  So, we're hearing we've got to attack Iran.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:22.883]  We've got to go into Iran because they've removed the seals from the nukes.
[00:12:23.404 --> 00:12:24.665]  How many headlines have I seen?
[00:12:24.685 --> 00:12:25.886]  How many headlines have you seen?
[00:12:26.226 --> 00:12:27.827]  It's every day, every weekend.
[00:12:28.087 --> 00:12:28.668]  The newspaper.
[00:12:28.708 --> 00:12:29.909]  You sit down to read the newspaper.
[00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:34.672]  Well, the average American now sits down to read the laptop and to read their local newspaper.
[00:12:34.932 --> 00:12:44.179]  And you're sitting there eating bacon and eggs and drinking coffee and it's a nice sunny day outside and you have to sit there and read how they've got nukes, they're going to nuke us.
[00:12:44.219 --> 00:12:45.340]  Nukes, nukes, nukes.
[00:12:45.999 --> 00:12:50.320]  And they're talking at us, even the people that read newspapers, which is a cut above the average American.
[00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:51.960]  Most people don't even read newspapers.
[00:12:52.301 --> 00:12:54.581]  They talk to us like we're five years old.
[00:12:55.741 --> 00:12:58.602]  And everything's written at a fifth grade level.
[00:12:59.362 --> 00:13:00.903]  And I'm insulted by that.
[00:13:00.963 --> 00:13:02.203]  Aren't you insulted by that?
[00:13:02.243 --> 00:13:06.504]  I mean, we have a country that bent over backwards, that groveled, that did everything.
[00:13:06.744 --> 00:13:09.405]  We haven't heard any threats out of Iran in the last five years.
[00:13:09.445 --> 00:13:10.465]  They've been nothing but friendly.
[00:13:12.276 --> 00:13:18.581]  And they were getting a very moderate government in there, and guess what?
[00:13:19.001 --> 00:13:22.964]  The moderate said, no, work with the West, do what the UN says, everything will be okay.
[00:13:23.364 --> 00:13:27.327]  And then the West stabbed them in the back, and they said, that's it, we're going to put the radicals back in!
[00:13:27.688 --> 00:13:29.529]  You little liberals did nothing!
[00:13:29.589 --> 00:13:34.553]  I mean, liberals, reformers, were put in power, what, four years ago.
[00:13:36.023 --> 00:13:44.326]  And suddenly then, our government starts carrying out bombings over there, starts trying to get student uprisings, starts trying to overthrow the government.
[00:13:44.386 --> 00:13:45.246]  It admitted U.S.
[00:13:45.286 --> 00:13:47.707]  government policy to try to overthrow that country.
[00:13:48.247 --> 00:13:54.650]  And so, the moderates did everything, they got stabbed in the back, now there's a hardliner over there, and Washington just absolutely loves it.
[00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:58.091]  Now, their hardliner is nothing compared
[00:13:59.651 --> 00:14:00.831]  To China's hardliners.
[00:14:00.911 --> 00:14:11.814]  Listen, this morning I was talking to one of my webmasters, Ryan Slickheisen, here in the Austin office, and I'm standing over him and I say, do a search, try, Chinese general threatens to nuke U.S.
[00:14:11.834 --> 00:14:12.194]  cities.
[00:14:12.254 --> 00:14:16.115]  And the actual headline was, Chinese general warns of nuclear risk to U.S.
[00:14:16.135 --> 00:14:16.415]  cities.
[00:14:17.035 --> 00:14:20.176]  But just type that in, or type in, China threatens to nuke U.S.
[00:14:20.616 --> 00:14:22.316]  You'll get ten-year-old articles.
[00:14:22.716 --> 00:14:25.457]  Thousands of them will come up on Google or Yahoo.
[00:14:25.917 --> 00:14:26.477]  Thousands.
[00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:43.803]  And you can read official reports and Chinese government strategy documents and press conferences and they say that they've got between 50 and 100 Long March intercontinental ballistic missiles that can hold between 10 and 24 warheads apiece.
[00:14:43.843 --> 00:14:45.804]  That's each missile can target up to 24 cities.
[00:14:46.205 --> 00:14:55.292]  When it comes back into orbit with the MIRV technology, the re-entry device technology, the nose cone pops open and a bunch of smaller missiles shoot out and come down and kill you and your family.
[00:14:55.952 --> 00:15:01.076]  And you can just read where they say, we're targeting you, we may launch, we're letting you know up front, we may attack you.
[00:15:01.576 --> 00:15:06.300]  I mean, the Russians during the Cold War never said, we may strike you first.
[00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:07.961]  They were like, oh no, we're friendly, we're nice.
[00:15:08.902 --> 00:15:12.104]  And we were having drills jumping under our chairs.
[00:15:14.626 --> 00:15:16.407]  For those that are old enough, you probably remember that.
[00:15:16.427 --> 00:15:18.289]  You know, duct tape cover!
[00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:19.389]  Atomic attack!
[00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:20.450]  Hydrogen drill!
[00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:22.692]  A nuclear attack drill!
[00:15:24.261 --> 00:15:36.274]  And so all of this is going on, and every few months they call a press conference and they have big maps up, and you can even go online and watch the video of this, and there's the General and he's going, we're targeting this city, we're targeting that city.
[00:15:36.755 --> 00:15:38.937]  They're targeting the 200 largest U.S.
[00:15:39.297 --> 00:15:44.023]  cities, and again, we're not that big, we're 300 million people, that's nothing compared to China with 1,350,000,000, India now at a billion.
[00:15:47.003 --> 00:15:48.625]  Plus, a little bit over a billion.
[00:15:48.645 --> 00:15:50.086]  A billion of 50 million, they're saying.
[00:15:50.426 --> 00:15:51.147]  That's an old census.
[00:15:51.167 --> 00:15:52.068]  It's going to be even higher.
[00:15:52.508 --> 00:15:53.589]  You know, all these other countries.
[00:15:53.649 --> 00:15:55.050]  I mean, Mexico, 85 million.
[00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:56.692]  I mean, there's hundreds and hundreds of countries.
[00:15:57.052 --> 00:15:58.313]  Iran, 68 million.
[00:15:58.554 --> 00:16:00.375]  Nigeria, 240 million.
[00:16:00.415 --> 00:16:01.576]  I mean, it's just, there's a big planet.
[00:16:01.877 --> 00:16:03.418]  Six and a half plus bill now.
[00:16:03.438 --> 00:16:05.280]  I keep saying six billion, 300 million.
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.020]  That's old numbers.
[00:16:06.041 --> 00:16:07.742]  It's well over six and a half billion now.
[00:16:07.762 --> 00:16:08.583]  We're a small nation.
[00:16:09.241 --> 00:16:11.582]  I mean, you talk about being small.
[00:16:11.602 --> 00:16:20.805]  Depending on what almanac you look at, Austin, Texas, where I sit, is 38th, 39th, or 40th.
[00:16:20.845 --> 00:16:25.247]  It's different in different almanacs, but right now I think we're about the 38th largest city in the U.S.
[00:16:25.287 --> 00:16:25.927]  We're a little bitty.
[00:16:27.723 --> 00:16:31.367]  800,000 in the city, a couple hundred thousand metro outside.
[00:16:31.407 --> 00:16:33.028]  So we're a cool million right now.
[00:16:33.689 --> 00:16:36.652]  And believe me, Austin, just for off nights, I'm just using my town.
[00:16:37.353 --> 00:16:40.076]  I don't mean to be self-centered, but it's as good as any example to use.
[00:16:40.783 --> 00:16:42.885]  We have military bases all around us.
[00:16:43.205 --> 00:16:45.707]  And we have Fort Hood, we have San Antonio, all the big bases.
[00:16:46.127 --> 00:16:58.077]  And admittedly, Russia has dozens and dozens of entire warheads, or entire missile carriers that are carrying multiple warheads, aimed at my town.
[00:16:59.178 --> 00:17:02.681]  I mean, it will be a slag heap if there's ever an atomic or nuclear war.
[00:17:05.053 --> 00:17:14.400]  At the same time, I mean understand folks, we're number 38 or 40 depending on which statistic you look at.
[00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:18.363]  That means there are 160 other smaller towns.
[00:17:19.865 --> 00:17:23.367]  I mean small towns of just a couple hundred thousand people are targeted.
[00:17:24.068 --> 00:17:25.309]  I just want you to know that.
[00:17:26.169 --> 00:17:28.111]  And I want you to know that he got up
[00:17:29.053 --> 00:17:34.056]  They called a press conference a week before, and there were over a hundred top reporters.
[00:17:34.116 --> 00:17:34.836]  It's all listed here.
[00:17:34.856 --> 00:17:41.140]  Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Associated Press, Reuters, Financial Times of London, London Guardian.
[00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:52.046]  They're all there, and the head of their military, number three in their government, comes out and says that we're targeting you, and if you get involved in any
[00:17:52.881 --> 00:17:55.042]  Because I've read the text of the speech, not just the news articles.
[00:17:56.082 --> 00:17:57.202]  Those are even whitewashes.
[00:17:57.602 --> 00:17:58.522]  Wait till I read the articles.
[00:17:58.782 --> 00:18:01.423]  It doesn't sound like a whitewash, but even this is.
[00:18:02.243 --> 00:18:15.826]  He says, if you get involved in Taiwan, Panama Canal, any of our holdings, if you get involved in what is in Freeport, Bahamas, if you get involved in any of our national interests, we will preemptively strike you.
[00:18:16.747 --> 00:18:17.787]  We are targeted.
[00:18:18.267 --> 00:18:19.787]  We are preparing to attack.
[00:18:19.847 --> 00:18:20.828]  We now have subs.
[00:18:21.208 --> 00:18:21.908]  We have everything.
[00:18:24.154 --> 00:18:25.896]  And the news is we love China.
[00:18:25.916 --> 00:18:26.597]  They're our friend.
[00:18:26.637 --> 00:18:27.518]  They're our ally.
[00:18:27.778 --> 00:18:30.020]  Let's have communist Chinese parades in D.C.
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:33.764]  going on right now to celebrate 52 years of Mao.
[00:18:34.545 --> 00:18:37.388]  And these are people that kill 60 million of their own population.
[00:18:38.448 --> 00:18:52.192]  And I was talking to a family friend about an acquaintance who happens to be Chinese, and he had family who was a Chinese general, and he's supposedly an American, but he just talks about how China's big and Taiwan's bad and China's good.
[00:18:53.052 --> 00:18:56.793]  There's a lot of these people around here that just seem to not like America.
[00:18:57.674 --> 00:19:03.759]  And I got this email saying that I'm criticizing China threatening to nuke us, so I don't like Asians.
[00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:07.483]  You see, that's the new spin and the new twist on all of this.
[00:19:07.523 --> 00:19:11.887]  So, we're going to nuke you and kill you, and so then people try to make it a racial issue.
[00:19:11.947 --> 00:19:12.107]  No.
[00:19:12.487 --> 00:19:18.293]  Believe me, if the Russians were saying this, or if Israel was saying this, or if South Africa, who has nukes, was saying this, I'd be upset.
[00:19:18.633 --> 00:19:20.034]  But again, they always try to cloud it.
[00:19:20.054 --> 00:19:22.857]  We're talking about the end of our civilization here, and these
[00:19:23.397 --> 00:19:27.718]  And these brainwashed individuals can't get past, well you can't criticize China because they're Asian.
[00:19:30.018 --> 00:19:35.539]  So... So here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.220]  Here it is, right out in the open.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:43.541]  Chinese General warns of nuclear risk to U.S.
[00:19:43.921 --> 00:19:49.282]  Senior Chinese General has warned that his country could destroy hundreds of American cities with nuclear weapons
[00:19:50.063 --> 00:19:52.065]  If the two nations clashed over Taiwan.
[00:19:52.465 --> 00:19:53.486]  But that's not what he said.
[00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:56.829]  He said, if you get involved in any of our interests, we'll do this to you.
[00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:58.370]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[00:19:58.391 --> 00:19:58.771]  Stay with us.
[00:20:02.463 --> 00:20:06.908]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[00:20:07.188 --> 00:20:10.772]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[00:20:10.932 --> 00:20:19.060]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:24.926]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[00:20:25.226 --> 00:20:30.488]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[00:20:30.729 --> 00:20:32.829]  This is why you need the Filter Mag.
[00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:45.235]  The Filter Mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[00:20:45.475 --> 00:20:49.898]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[00:20:50.119 --> 00:20:51.059]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:20:51.239 --> 00:20:52.861]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[00:20:53.001 --> 00:20:54.782]  That's FilterMag.com.
[00:20:55.042 --> 00:20:55.523]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[00:20:55.563 --> 00:20:55.743]  That's 800-345-8376.
[00:21:04.543 --> 00:21:05.584]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:05.984 --> 00:21:11.467]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:21:12.047 --> 00:21:12.527]  That's right.
[00:21:12.848 --> 00:21:15.129]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:21:15.449 --> 00:21:22.613]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:30.885]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:31.306 --> 00:21:36.169]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:21:36.809 --> 00:21:39.211]  If you'd like to take a look at gold pre-retirement,
[00:21:39.551 --> 00:21:41.812]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:42.592 --> 00:21:46.733]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:21:47.113 --> 00:21:47.353]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:47.373 --> 00:21:49.314]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:21:49.374 --> 00:21:49.674]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:49.974 --> 00:21:50.254]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:02.563 --> 00:22:07.864]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.

[00:22:53.725 --> 00:22:57.768]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:22:58.048 --> 00:22:59.309]  That's toll-free, triple
[00:23:04.071 --> 00:23:06.732]  Is your quality of life reduced because of health problems?
[00:23:06.952 --> 00:23:08.752]  Are you starting to feel the signs of aging?
[00:23:08.912 --> 00:23:12.934]  Are you relatively healthy but wonder if you can do more to maintain proper health?
[00:23:13.134 --> 00:23:14.514]  Now there's Stem Enhance.
[00:23:14.914 --> 00:23:19.476]  Stem Enhance is a new product category of phytonutrients that help in renewing your body.
[00:23:19.736 --> 00:23:25.539]  Stem Enhance's natural ingredients help to support the release of stem cells from your bone marrow into your bloodstream.
[00:23:25.759 --> 00:23:37.185]  Through a natural process, those stem cells have the amazing ability to transform into any type of cell in the body, like heart cells, brain cells, liver cells, can all be generated from this powerful building block.
[00:23:37.465 --> 00:23:46.970]  Thousands of people who use Stem Enhance have reported spectacular results, experiencing everything from an increase in energy in just a few days, to an improvement in overall health.
[00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:52.673]  Not available in stores, STEM Enhance is available by contacting Dr. Patricia Markaitis at 860-567-7744.
[00:23:52.733 --> 00:23:53.013]  That's 860-567-7744.
[00:23:53.093 --> 00:23:57.075]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:23:57.155 --> 00:23:58.796]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:11.308 --> 00:24:21.177]  Well, the phone's up early in the next segment, and I specifically want to hear from callers on this subject, on the Iran situation, on what's happening with China.
[00:24:22.478 --> 00:24:24.280]  But there's no ifs, ands, or buts about it.
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:26.322]  Iran hasn't threatened us.
[00:24:26.502 --> 00:24:28.063]  Iran hasn't done anything.
[00:24:29.124 --> 00:24:34.088]  They have bent over backwards to submit to the UN, which I say is bad to begin with.
[00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:36.591]  And what do they get in turn?
[00:24:37.011 --> 00:24:37.872]  They get scammed.
[00:24:38.883 --> 00:24:44.149]  And our media engages in third grade politics about nukes, nukes, nukes.
[00:24:44.169 --> 00:24:49.034]  Then you read in the bottom of each article, which nobody seems to read, it says peaceful nuclear reactors.
[00:24:49.074 --> 00:24:50.755]  But they use the headline, nukes.
[00:24:50.815 --> 00:24:52.257]  It's pure yellow journalism.
[00:24:53.538 --> 00:24:57.222]  Meanwhile, Chinese general warns of nuclear risk to the US.
[00:24:57.262 --> 00:25:00.906]  A senior Chinese general has warned that his country could destroy hundreds.
[00:25:02.339 --> 00:25:07.722]  ...of American cities with nuclear weapons if the two nations clash over Taiwan.
[00:25:08.122 --> 00:25:28.674]  Major General Xu Xin, who, a dean of the National Defense University, said he was expressing a private opinion, but his comments, the most inflammatory by a senior government official in ten years, and he's currently at the top running of their military, will fuel growing concerns in Washington about the rise of China.
[00:25:28.714 --> 00:25:30.495]  Now, I actually went and read his full comments.
[00:25:30.535 --> 00:25:31.316]  It's much worse
[00:25:31.856 --> 00:25:37.620]  Then the London Guardian saying because they can't have China threatening to nuke us, meanwhile picking on Iran.
[00:25:38.921 --> 00:25:45.465]  Speaking at a lecture arranged by the foreign ministry and attended by several foreign correspondents on Thursday,
[00:25:46.411 --> 00:25:52.112]  Mr. Zhu said China was prepared to initiate non-conventional warfare over Taiwan.
[00:25:52.653 --> 00:26:02.775]  War logic dictates that a weaker power needs to use maximum efforts to defeat a stronger rival, he was reported as saying by the New York Times.
[00:26:03.175 --> 00:26:12.938]  If the Americans draw their missiles and position guided ammunition onto the target zone of China's territory, I think we will have to respond with nuclear weapons.
[00:26:13.938 --> 00:26:17.739]  If anything's even aimed at them on the Taiwan Strait, they'll attack.
[00:26:18.139 --> 00:26:20.039]  And he went on to talk about other Chinese interests.
[00:26:20.499 --> 00:26:34.382]  Echoing threats made in 1995, Mr. Zhu, who has a reputation as a hawk in the Chinese military circles, said his country was ready to sustain heavy casualties in Beijing, Shanghai, and other heavily populated areas.
[00:26:34.682 --> 00:26:40.083]  We Chinese will prepare ourselves for the destruction of all the cities east of Xi'an.
[00:26:40.683 --> 00:26:41.663]  Am I pronouncing that right?
[00:26:45.107 --> 00:26:53.956]  He said, of course the Americans will have to be prepared that hundreds of cities, and the real translation is 200 cities, will be destroyed by the Chinese.
[00:26:54.276 --> 00:27:03.044]  Although Mr. Zhu said war was unlikely, his proposal that China should adopt a first strike nuclear option against the U.S.
[00:27:03.084 --> 00:27:04.866]  will alarm the Pentagon.
[00:27:05.865 --> 00:27:06.625]  Well, why should it?
[00:27:07.065 --> 00:27:10.487]  The Pentagon is running around with the insane policy saying they can nuke Iran.
[00:27:10.627 --> 00:27:11.027]  On record.
[00:27:11.067 --> 00:27:14.908]  Rumsfeld, Jacques Chirot, the supposed liberal, just said it.
[00:27:15.148 --> 00:27:18.569]  Again, showing that the globalists are all on the same team.
[00:27:18.609 --> 00:27:19.950]  They have these staged fights.
[00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:26.612]  China tested its first atomic bomb in 1964, but it claims that it has an arsenal of nuclear weapons.
[00:27:26.632 --> 00:27:30.053]  It's the smallest among the five nations of the UN Security Council.
[00:27:31.135 --> 00:27:37.299]  According to a recent article in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, China only has 18 intercontinental ballistic missiles.
[00:27:37.319 --> 00:27:38.120]  China says 50 to 100.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.882]  Hand-bullet delivering a nuclear warhead to U.S.
[00:27:40.922 --> 00:27:41.382]  mainland.
[00:27:41.402 --> 00:27:42.143]  Well, that's not true.
[00:27:42.183 --> 00:27:45.345]  They have MERV packages in their nose cones.
[00:27:45.986 --> 00:27:47.487]  Most sit in their silos.
[00:27:48.147 --> 00:27:48.647]  However, U.S.
[00:27:49.127 --> 00:27:57.570]  intelligence predicts that over the next 15 years, China will expand its IBM Force, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Force, to 75 to 100.
[00:27:57.770 --> 00:27:59.270]  They already have that again.
[00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:02.531]  Strategic nuclear warheads targeting primarily the U.S.
[00:28:03.011 --> 00:28:07.512]  They will be mounted on new mobile solid-fuel rockets, the Dong-Feng 31, and possibly
[00:28:10.131 --> 00:28:12.732]  Miniaturized for launch from China's submarine fleet.
[00:28:13.252 --> 00:28:13.692]  The U.S.
[00:28:13.712 --> 00:28:21.775]  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld recently expressed concern about Beijing's growing military power, meanwhile selling it all to them.
[00:28:22.035 --> 00:28:26.117]  And again, it was Rumsfeld's companies that helped arm North Korea, helped arm China.
[00:28:26.357 --> 00:28:28.978]  We always hear Bill Clinton getting criticized, and rightfully so.
[00:28:29.972 --> 00:28:45.626]  We're giving supercomputers for miniaturization processes and MIRV technology to the Communist Chinese, the Long March technology from Laurel and Hughes, but it was actual sitting Republicans who were actually making the money.
[00:28:45.947 --> 00:28:47.888]  I mean, Bill Clinton was just a whore, politically.
[00:28:47.948 --> 00:28:49.530]  He did everything everyone wanted.
[00:28:50.685 --> 00:28:52.786]  And now Bush comes in, and this is on the record.
[00:28:53.086 --> 00:28:54.226]  Remember conservatives?
[00:28:54.286 --> 00:28:57.688]  All the screaming and yelling about missile secrets and supercomputers?
[00:28:58.088 --> 00:29:03.570]  Bush comes in and lets the transfer of actual cruise missile factory blueprints.
[00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:06.531]  I mean, they're not just selling him the cruise missiles now.
[00:29:07.071 --> 00:29:07.511]  Oh no!
[00:29:08.491 --> 00:29:11.733]  Bush has said outsourcing is our greatest export.
[00:29:12.333 --> 00:29:13.953]  That's really a sick joke.
[00:29:14.073 --> 00:29:16.934]  And fast food is manufacturing.
[00:29:17.034 --> 00:29:18.535]  Folks, these are official statements.
[00:29:19.774 --> 00:29:23.535]  And so they're getting the factories to build the equivalent of F-18s.
[00:29:23.976 --> 00:29:26.997]  They're getting the factories to build the missile cruisers.
[00:29:27.017 --> 00:29:29.398]  They're getting the factories to build Russian subs.
[00:29:29.418 --> 00:29:31.738]  They're getting the factories to build cruise missiles.
[00:29:32.659 --> 00:29:34.560]  But they're not a threat.
[00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:36.000]  Targeting U.S.
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:36.920]  cities.
[00:29:37.281 --> 00:29:38.141]  It's Iran.
[00:29:38.985 --> 00:29:41.346]  Which is in the Stone Age, a total pushover.
[00:29:41.646 --> 00:29:42.366]  That's why.
[00:29:42.846 --> 00:29:46.047]  So the globalists can sell weapons systems and invade another country.
[00:29:46.367 --> 00:29:48.148]  It is so sick.
[00:29:48.688 --> 00:29:49.968]  We'll be right back with your call.
[00:29:49.988 --> 00:29:50.488]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.889 --> 00:29:52.789]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:54.890]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:58.471]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.153 --> 00:30:04.515]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:30:04.755 --> 00:30:06.776]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:30:06.936 --> 00:30:13.981]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[00:30:14.241 --> 00:30:22.827]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.

[00:30:50.158 --> 00:30:52.520]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[00:31:01.747 --> 00:31:07.990]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:14.293]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:14.573 --> 00:31:23.017]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:23.258 --> 00:31:30.261]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:31:30.581 --> 00:31:35.404]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:31:35.624 --> 00:31:41.028]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:31:41.368 --> 00:31:44.450]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:31:44.771 --> 00:31:52.776]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:52.796 --> 00:31:53.356]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:32:05.069 --> 00:32:10.298]  Do you desire your health and vitality to be in harmony with the rhythms of nature?
[00:32:13.095 --> 00:32:21.479]  TriVortex technology features subtle energy products that boost energy levels, release pain and stress, and much more at very affordable prices.
[00:32:22.139 --> 00:32:29.582]  You have the opportunity to wear vitamins, minerals, and nutrients that absorb through your skin rather than taking them orally.
[00:32:30.082 --> 00:32:31.863]  This is real, not science fiction.
[00:32:32.523 --> 00:32:41.167]  Go to TriVortex.com, that is T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X.com to open a whole new realm of health and vitality for you and your family.
[00:32:43.689 --> 00:32:53.337]  This is Brian David Anderson, inventor of TriVortex technology products that assist in so many areas, such as pain relief, symptoms of menopause, losing weight, or stopping smoking.
[00:32:53.838 --> 00:32:57.761]  TriVortex technology is in harmony with the rhythms of nature.
[00:33:14.339 --> 00:33:16.580]  And I've talked to neocon followers.
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:23.484]  They were formerly called conservatives, but now they're willing to give up the Second Amendment, willing to give up our borders, willing to give up everything.
[00:33:23.524 --> 00:33:24.945]  They think that's conservative now.
[00:33:25.005 --> 00:33:26.826]  They think that big government's conservative.
[00:33:27.366 --> 00:33:28.147]  And I've talked to them.
[00:33:28.207 --> 00:33:30.688]  I've been doing a lot of on-the-street interviews for an upcoming film.
[00:33:31.549 --> 00:33:35.811]  And I've done interviews out in Crawford and talked to the yahoos out there when all those protests were going on.
[00:33:35.851 --> 00:33:39.393]  And you say to them, but China threatens to nuke us.
[00:33:41.717 --> 00:33:48.661]  And all these other countries are out there threatening us, really threatening back.
[00:33:48.761 --> 00:33:50.082]  But you don't think they're a threat?
[00:33:50.202 --> 00:33:52.083]  No, Iran and Syria are the threat.
[00:33:52.944 --> 00:34:04.711]  But our governments have been trying to destabilize those countries, trying to actually ensure that hardline governments go in there so that they can basically have wars with them.
[00:34:05.609 --> 00:34:10.513]  And have a place to have weapons sales and to have a big political distraction here domestically.
[00:34:11.013 --> 00:34:12.715]  And it's like their eyes glaze over.
[00:34:12.735 --> 00:34:13.815]  They just don't understand.
[00:34:14.236 --> 00:34:16.718]  And then they'll say, well we'll deal with China later.
[00:34:17.378 --> 00:34:19.660]  Oh yeah, our government's really dealing with them.
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:22.302]  Whether it's the Democrats who are in office or the Republicans.
[00:34:23.083 --> 00:34:27.906]  And we have a over a hundred billion dollars a month now trade deficit.
[00:34:28.427 --> 00:34:29.428]  Last time I checked.
[00:34:29.828 --> 00:34:32.290]  And most of that is with China.
[00:34:32.410 --> 00:34:33.751]  I mean, that's insane!
[00:34:34.551 --> 00:34:35.552]  There's nothing.
[00:34:36.012 --> 00:34:46.278]  I've been to the Long Beach Pier, Long Beach Complex in San Diego, and there's nothing going out but raw materials.
[00:34:46.318 --> 00:34:46.858]  Nothing!
[00:34:47.579 --> 00:34:51.181]  Nothing, unless it's the blueprints for how to build cruise missiles.
[00:34:52.542 --> 00:34:56.524]  Now we don't even sell them the factory parts, we just sell them the factory diagram.
[00:34:57.509 --> 00:35:03.771]  And it's a group that openly has mobile execution vans driving around, killing its own citizens.
[00:35:04.111 --> 00:35:08.773]  The Communist government openly advertises organs in medical journals.
[00:35:08.853 --> 00:35:13.094]  Oh, this is where you, quote, get the fresh organs in the English translation.
[00:35:13.495 --> 00:35:17.096]  They get all the big UN awards for forced abortion and infanticide.
[00:35:17.376 --> 00:35:22.077]  They admit that they come and kill your baby and take it and sell it for body parts.
[00:35:22.098 --> 00:35:26.219]  And I don't want to hear that they don't do that, because their own government advertises it!
[00:35:28.556 --> 00:35:34.639]  They have public executions where they have whole football stadiums filled with cheering people.
[00:35:34.759 --> 00:35:38.040]  Folks, I have family who works in China who has seen it.
[00:35:38.481 --> 00:35:46.324]  But you can just type in public execution China into a search engine and hit the image section and you'll get it, folks.
[00:35:47.525 --> 00:35:49.846]  And so I'm not here trying to demonize China.
[00:35:50.892 --> 00:35:53.093]  Their people, on average, are good, hard-working folks.
[00:35:53.774 --> 00:35:54.814]  But, I mean, come on!
[00:35:54.854 --> 00:35:58.996]  They're threatening to nuke us, and the official government has threatened to nuke us before.
[00:36:00.117 --> 00:36:06.360]  Their population is at slave wages at best, and in many cases are in actual slave camps.
[00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:12.323]  I mean, it's been in the mainstream news that Walmart, years ago, had 700 slave camps.
[00:36:12.583 --> 00:36:17.766]  Actual prison factories built right up against the prisons.
[00:36:19.221 --> 00:36:28.603]  And of course, here in America, we're shifting over to that economy now, where the millions of people that are in our prison system are working in prison industries.
[00:36:28.643 --> 00:36:33.224]  And so many people go, good, you know, make those lazy criminals pay their way.
[00:36:34.205 --> 00:36:34.545]  No!
[00:36:34.725 --> 00:36:35.805]  Think for yourselves!
[00:36:35.865 --> 00:36:40.906]  Can you compete against somebody at slave wages in India or China, getting 20 cents an hour?
[00:36:41.566 --> 00:36:45.928]  And that's just what they just so happen to get in the private prisons here in America, on average?
[00:36:46.688 --> 00:36:47.388]  20 cents an hour?
[00:36:48.112 --> 00:36:53.717]  And then they even buy the goods from the very private company that pays them, so all the money stays there?
[00:36:54.017 --> 00:37:00.202]  I mean, can you compete with taxpayer-subsidized, subsidized slavery?
[00:37:00.402 --> 00:37:04.966]  It isn't just slavery, it's taxpayer-subsidized with subsidies.
[00:37:05.327 --> 00:37:10.411]  A lot of the security and things in the land is paid for by the federal or state governments.
[00:37:11.872 --> 00:37:13.493]  And I'm not trying to be negative here.
[00:37:13.593 --> 00:37:16.336]  I mean, now, if you live in the countryside of Texas,
[00:37:17.339 --> 00:37:20.840]  You either work for a government agency or you work for the private prison.
[00:37:22.101 --> 00:37:23.941]  I mean, that's really basically it.
[00:37:23.982 --> 00:37:25.442]  Or maybe for the power plant.
[00:37:26.202 --> 00:37:30.684]  Or maybe for one of the coal mining companies here.
[00:37:31.324 --> 00:37:34.765]  I mean, it's just the death of the rural areas.
[00:37:35.466 --> 00:37:38.907]  And it's, well, the only job I can have is at the prison.
[00:37:39.607 --> 00:37:41.928]  And we ship prisoners in from all over the U.S.
[00:37:41.948 --> 00:37:42.768]  here to Texas.
[00:37:43.069 --> 00:37:44.189]  We warehouse them.
[00:37:45.129 --> 00:37:49.070]  They're now even talking about warehousing foreign prisoners here in Texas.
[00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:50.470]  Just prisons everywhere.
[00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:57.891]  So, with all of this going on, what are we being told to worry about?
[00:37:57.971 --> 00:38:00.352]  We're being told to worry about Iran.
[00:38:02.152 --> 00:38:03.913]  And it is just such a fraud.
[00:38:03.953 --> 00:38:05.253]  They don't have a nuclear weapon.
[00:38:05.273 --> 00:38:06.313]  They don't have an A-bomb.
[00:38:06.613 --> 00:38:11.794]  They're conservatively a decade away if they were left alone to do it.
[00:38:12.972 --> 00:38:15.153]  And then there's the whole discussion of sovereignty.
[00:38:16.513 --> 00:38:18.294]  Again, it's a false debate.
[00:38:18.334 --> 00:38:19.354]  Either you accept U.N.
[00:38:19.394 --> 00:38:34.419]  domination and inspectors running your whole economy and your society, and what you can do technologically, that's the good cop, the liberal cop, and then there's the bad cop, or we'll sick the evil neocon Americans on you, meanwhile Jack Chirac's now jumping up and down.
[00:38:34.819 --> 00:38:35.960]  It is staged.
[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:42.502]  And the most incredible thing about it, and we're going to your calls, the most incredible thing about it,
[00:38:43.773 --> 00:38:50.477]  Is that there are news articles that I saw yesterday and today, and I've heard it on talk radio, where they're going, UNBELIEVABLE!
[00:38:50.917 --> 00:38:53.138]  IRAN THREATENS THE U.S.
[00:38:53.198 --> 00:38:54.319]  AND ISRAEL AND EUROPE!
[00:38:55.620 --> 00:39:05.585]  And then you go and you read what they actually said, their president, who I think has even shot his mouth off too much, but it's, I mean, it's nothing compared to our leaders, our masters.
[00:39:07.475 --> 00:39:15.580]  Okay, if you attack us, and he said if you nuke us, he was responding to Jacques Chirac, I meant Jacques Chirac, I'll nuke you.
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:18.821]  We'll use nuclear weapons on you.
[00:39:19.041 --> 00:39:19.982]  He said that two days ago.
[00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:23.551]  And then Iran says, okay, we'll defend ourselves!
[00:39:24.151 --> 00:39:24.991]  We'll fight back!
[00:39:25.451 --> 00:39:26.812]  Oh, oh my gosh!
[00:39:27.072 --> 00:39:29.672]  They said if we attack them, they're gonna fight!
[00:39:29.712 --> 00:39:31.953]  Have you ever heard of someone so evil?
[00:39:32.213 --> 00:39:37.575]  If we drop weapons on them, if we kill millions of them, they'll fight back!
[00:39:37.715 --> 00:39:40.295]  I've never heard of someone so radical!
[00:39:43.156 --> 00:39:45.137]  I mean, this blows my mind.
[00:39:45.357 --> 00:39:46.777]  And meanwhile, who runs this government?
[00:39:47.457 --> 00:39:48.357]  Chicago Tribune?
[00:39:48.377 --> 00:39:49.238]  Associated Press?
[00:39:49.718 --> 00:39:50.338]  Halliburton?
[00:39:51.861 --> 00:40:12.780]  Not just DynCorp now, in white slavery, I mean, admitted slave camps, grabbing people to work as slaves, sex slaves, physical slaves, from Europe and the Middle East, admittedly, and Central Asia, just admit, I mean, actually grabbing whole villages and taking them to work as slaves, not even using the rubric of, oh, they're terrorists.
[00:40:13.821 --> 00:40:14.581]  Oh, and by the way, now,
[00:40:16.286 --> 00:40:22.247]  Halliburton, who got caught bringing in tens of thousands of illegal aliens to rebuild in New Orleans, and then cheating them, not even paying them.
[00:40:22.427 --> 00:40:23.968]  That's how mafia they are!
[00:40:25.028 --> 00:40:26.708]  Just knowing no one's going to stop them.
[00:40:26.748 --> 00:40:29.129]  That's in the Thomas Pickens Union, the big paper in New Orleans.
[00:40:29.149 --> 00:40:29.949]  I mean, this is admitted!
[00:40:31.389 --> 00:40:35.550]  They now are going to run the detention centers, quote, for the illegal aliens.
[00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:38.651]  And folks, we've told you a long time, that's a cover for real FEMA camps.
[00:40:39.071 --> 00:40:40.031]  I've got that article today.
[00:40:40.051 --> 00:40:41.391]  I mean, this is the kind of news I've got.
[00:40:42.851 --> 00:40:45.392]  I mean, we have crooks running our country.
[00:40:46.974 --> 00:40:51.835]  Bought and paid for by these international corporations, and they're playing America.
[00:40:51.875 --> 00:40:54.196]  America's playing the part of the new evil empire.
[00:40:54.236 --> 00:40:57.716]  We're playing the part the Soviets played in the last century.
[00:40:58.857 --> 00:40:59.457]  Okay, that's enough.
[00:40:59.477 --> 00:41:00.037]  We'll go to calls.
[00:41:00.057 --> 00:41:00.197]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:41:00.217 --> 00:41:00.277]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:41:00.297 --> 00:41:04.058]  And then coming up later, we are now in more debt than people were in the depth of the Depression.
[00:41:04.098 --> 00:41:04.658]  The savings
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:19.182]  Debt ratio is now the lowest in U.S.
[00:41:19.202 --> 00:41:22.504]  history and the lowest in world history.
[00:41:24.606 --> 00:41:26.167]  That's official government numbers.
[00:41:27.047 --> 00:41:29.049]  And, uh, yeah, this is a great economy.
[00:41:29.169 --> 00:41:29.529]  Okay.
[00:41:29.989 --> 00:41:31.910]  John in Ohio, you're on the air.
[00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:32.331]  Welcome.
[00:41:33.171 --> 00:41:33.572]  Hello.
[00:41:34.092 --> 00:41:41.637]  I wish Rutherford Tarpey was still on because I think he has a more measured and sane version of what China is doing right now.
[00:41:42.350 --> 00:42:00.915]  And I really believe, you know, you're absolutely right about the lies, the exaggerations that are justifying an attack on both Iraq and Iran now, using the same lies, showing the fact that countries, only countries that are disarmed, like Iraq, humiliatedly allowed itself to be all it got for that.
[00:42:00.935 --> 00:42:02.095]  Hey, listen, I agree.
[00:42:02.175 --> 00:42:05.036]  Countries should be allowed to have their own weapons.
[00:42:05.576 --> 00:42:08.937]  Who says that the elite that runs our country is the only group that can have weapons?
[00:42:08.977 --> 00:42:11.418]  But I just want to point out, John, our elite,
[00:42:12.498 --> 00:42:18.086]  Our masters helped arm China, and helped arm Russia, and helped arm North Korea, and that's a historical fact.
[00:42:18.666 --> 00:42:25.936]  So they've created this global crisis, but still, are you denying that China sells political dissidence organs?
[00:42:26.477 --> 00:42:29.541]  Are you denying that China tortures Falun Gong and Christians?
[00:42:30.241 --> 00:42:31.942]  No, come on, just stop denying it.
[00:42:32.002 --> 00:42:32.862]  They admit it.
[00:42:33.022 --> 00:42:37.083]  They put it in official government, you know, the People's Daily, buddy.
[00:42:37.263 --> 00:42:38.764]  I read it almost every day.
[00:42:39.524 --> 00:42:44.166]  You've called before and you say China's good and it's a bunch of baloney.
[00:42:44.386 --> 00:42:45.206]  I never said that.
[00:42:45.426 --> 00:42:46.046]  Now, wait a minute.
[00:42:46.066 --> 00:42:47.267]  Now, wait a minute, Alex.
[00:42:47.547 --> 00:42:50.748]  As you even say it, it's not a question of whether they're good, bad, or indifferent.
[00:42:50.808 --> 00:42:51.788]  It's also a question
[00:42:52.262 --> 00:43:00.950]  Of whatever badness they have, are guilty of, we have to realize that we're subjected to a lot of propaganda, and in many cases it's false.
[00:43:01.331 --> 00:43:04.073]  And it's not a question of whether they're good, bad, or indifferent.
[00:43:04.674 --> 00:43:13.162]  As you understand, and I believe you're going to end up on the same side as the neocons and the military-industrial complex, and in fact I think you're prematurely
[00:43:13.582 --> 00:43:14.403]  We're good to go.
[00:43:24.324 --> 00:43:29.106]  On Iraq and Iran are just a dress rehearsal for their attack on their ultimate target.
[00:43:29.146 --> 00:43:31.127]  They said it in the PNAC document.
[00:43:31.447 --> 00:43:35.768]  It's China as the ultimate obstacle to this mad plan for world domination.
[00:43:36.088 --> 00:43:45.332]  So I believe that if you look at the situation of what they've actually said, and I've read one of your articles, you claim that they have these aggressive intentions.
[00:43:45.757 --> 00:43:49.561]  As a result of one of their articles claiming somehow that they believed in a world order.
[00:43:49.641 --> 00:43:54.606]  I read the text of that article and it said they believe in no use of a first strike.
[00:43:54.626 --> 00:43:57.589]  They believe that countries should be sovereign, big and small.
[00:43:57.890 --> 00:44:04.476]  That there should be a resolution of all conflicts and disagreements by negotiations, not by force.
[00:44:04.837 --> 00:44:07.820]  And you did not, you totally misrepresented
[00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:11.283]  That claim that somehow they were out for some kind of a new world order.
[00:44:11.303 --> 00:44:18.671]  Their new world order was exactly the opposite of what this neocon is doing to the world, its own plans for world order.
[00:44:18.691 --> 00:44:20.853]  Let me stop you, John, because I've been letting you talk for a while here.
[00:44:21.274 --> 00:44:23.937]  Number one, it's not fair of you to claim
[00:44:24.737 --> 00:44:46.514]  That Nebula is some document that I misquoted, when there is a whole body of reportage and speeches and statements by Russia and by China about how they're going to have a bipolar New World Order, and they're taking the lead against the evil Anglo-American, British, European, US power axis.
[00:44:46.634 --> 00:44:47.194]  Let me finish.
[00:44:47.955 --> 00:44:53.799]  Because you said I was lying about something, or that I was being dishonest, or that I was exaggerating, and I was not.
[00:44:53.879 --> 00:44:56.100]  I mean, so that's not true.
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:57.001]  It is.
[00:44:57.081 --> 00:44:57.942]  I read that article.
[00:44:58.042 --> 00:44:58.662]  I read that article.
[00:44:58.762 --> 00:44:59.843]  I don't know what article.
[00:44:59.863 --> 00:45:01.144]  Okay, what was the name of the article?
[00:45:01.804 --> 00:45:05.166]  It was something to do with, and I should have printed it.
[00:45:05.186 --> 00:45:11.551]  I looked up, and I even saw it when I checked the body of the thing on your own website.
[00:45:11.611 --> 00:45:13.432]  It said they were for peaceful resolution.
[00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:24.185]  For the sovereignty of all countries, the no use of a first force, as a contrast to what the United States... Sir, I just read the quote from the top Chinese general, and I'm going to... But I'm going to disavow it.
[00:45:24.265 --> 00:45:28.247]  I'm going to disavow it by the larger... Hold on, put him on... Johnny, let me talk.
[00:45:30.035 --> 00:45:33.780]  I just read where he said he has first strike capability.
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:37.945]  Putin has said they reserve the right for first strike against any country.
[00:45:38.225 --> 00:45:45.694]  Now, you can type that into the search engine and get official Russian government press releases saying they have first strike too.
[00:45:46.255 --> 00:45:48.418]  Are you saying they haven't said they'll use first strike?
[00:45:49.031 --> 00:45:50.632]  I don't know that, but I know that we have.
[00:45:50.732 --> 00:45:52.033]  I know that this government has.
[00:45:52.114 --> 00:45:52.914]  I know they have.
[00:45:52.954 --> 00:45:57.057]  They can attack any country, even non-nuclear countries, as a first strike.
[00:45:57.077 --> 00:46:00.000]  You know, John, I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill.
[00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:01.381]  What I'm saying here...
[00:46:02.043 --> 00:46:03.604]  Do you get what I'm saying?
[00:46:04.084 --> 00:46:13.670]  To the neocon listeners out there, who are dumbed down, who mean well, who are just ignorant, who just think it's like rooting for a sports team, you know, I'm for the USA!
[00:46:13.911 --> 00:46:20.695]  They don't know the USA has been seized by this private international cabal who is engaging in world empire building, okay?
[00:46:21.095 --> 00:46:25.258]  But at the same time, I'm saying any centralized power always becomes imperial,
[00:46:25.738 --> 00:46:49.711]  And you know the Soviets engage in imperialistic activity as well, and so all I'm trying to point out here is that Iran has done nothing to us, and you can point that out to neocons by comparing what North Korea and China have said, and what they're now targeting us with, and then you can say, well if they've got nukes and are targeting us, why aren't they a problem, but then Iran is?
[00:46:50.211 --> 00:46:56.052]  I don't want to trade a horrible war against Iraq and Iran for a genocidal war with North Korea and China.
[00:46:56.392 --> 00:46:59.153]  And this has been exactly what is on their back burner.
[00:46:59.193 --> 00:47:00.573]  They are going to get around to that.
[00:47:00.613 --> 00:47:06.334]  These neocons cut their teeth on anti-China, anti-communist lies and exaggeration.
[00:47:06.954 --> 00:47:13.756]  And to take that prematurely and put it on steroids is actually going to play exactly into their hands.
[00:47:13.776 --> 00:47:15.776]  You know, John, I didn't put anything on steroids.
[00:47:15.856 --> 00:47:16.896]  I appreciate your call.
[00:47:17.336 --> 00:47:19.797]  I read exactly what the Chinese general said.
[00:47:20.578 --> 00:47:23.159]  And he is at the highest levels of their military.
[00:47:23.959 --> 00:47:27.420]  So I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:33.702]  And China officially kills people's babies.
[00:47:34.382 --> 00:47:37.123]  They officially force women to have abortions.
[00:47:37.863 --> 00:47:43.605]  They officially have slave camps for little kids making firecrackers.
[00:47:44.625 --> 00:47:45.826]  Black cat firecrackers.
[00:47:45.846 --> 00:47:47.126]  You know, the whole nine yards.
[00:47:48.407 --> 00:47:51.068]  So, and we always hear about him blowing up.
[00:47:51.088 --> 00:47:53.029]  I mean, I don't, just please.
[00:47:53.789 --> 00:47:54.970]  You see, this is what happens.
[00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:56.950]  It's an either or.
[00:47:57.010 --> 00:47:58.391]  It's like a football team.
[00:47:58.851 --> 00:48:02.272]  It's like, you know, the commies are good and America's bad.
[00:48:02.672 --> 00:48:02.992]  No!
[00:48:03.833 --> 00:48:10.295]  The International Crime Syndicate openly funded the Soviets, openly put Mao into power.
[00:48:11.677 --> 00:48:18.026]  I've got David Rockefeller quotes out of New York Times when Mao died, how wonderful he was, how good he is.
[00:48:18.467 --> 00:48:21.671]  It was Bush and the neocons that went and opened up China.
[00:48:22.112 --> 00:48:23.193]  It was Bush Sr.
[00:48:23.213 --> 00:48:26.558]  who was the head ambassador, the toady of Henry Kissinger.
[00:48:27.399 --> 00:48:29.560]  I mean, you see, you do not know of what you speak.
[00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:39.405]  The globalists are using China to leverage out our jobs as an economic juggernaut to cause economic consolidation in a mercantile model.
[00:48:39.646 --> 00:48:41.306]  Learn what mercantilism is, John.
[00:48:41.326 --> 00:48:42.467]  You probably already know what it is.
[00:48:42.507 --> 00:48:44.268]  You just haven't put two and two together.
[00:48:44.728 --> 00:48:46.289]  It's crony capitalism.
[00:48:46.349 --> 00:48:47.610]  It's not free market.
[00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:48.750]  Okay?
[00:48:49.351 --> 00:48:53.913]  And they went over there and they made deals with China to leverage out their competition here domestically.
[00:48:54.637 --> 00:48:56.458]  And they're not going to have a war with China.
[00:48:56.478 --> 00:48:57.279]  That's rhetoric.
[00:48:57.639 --> 00:48:58.940]  China's the global model.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.101]  I watch the CFR boys on C-SPAN.
[00:49:01.461 --> 00:49:04.023]  People that run this country and they talk about China's the model.
[00:49:04.323 --> 00:49:05.483]  America's kaput.
[00:49:05.864 --> 00:49:07.084]  America's the past.
[00:49:07.344 --> 00:49:08.625]  They're shutting us down.
[00:49:08.965 --> 00:49:10.186]  China is the model.
[00:49:10.466 --> 00:49:11.887]  Because they enslave their people.
[00:49:13.888 --> 00:49:14.769]  My goodness.
[00:49:16.009 --> 00:49:18.171]  You just can't get to the next level.
[00:49:18.311 --> 00:49:19.151]  Keith in Ohio.
[00:49:19.171 --> 00:49:20.212]  Another call from Ohio.
[00:49:20.472 --> 00:49:21.112]  Go ahead, Keith.
[00:49:22.733 --> 00:49:23.134]  Hello, Alex.
[00:49:23.494 --> 00:49:23.654]  Hi.
[00:49:24.823 --> 00:49:28.247]  You do good research there, you know, and I appreciate everything you do there.
[00:49:28.467 --> 00:49:32.892]  I think we're coming to a global communist empire.
[00:49:33.232 --> 00:49:37.917]  That's really what it's coming to, with the world's last dictator sitting on top of it.
[00:49:38.948 --> 00:49:40.589]  Well, I don't even use the term communist.
[00:49:40.609 --> 00:49:42.049]  That's a new term in the last 150 years.
[00:49:42.149 --> 00:49:53.454]  I mean, it was always freedom versus slavery, tyrants versus the people, and if you look at communism, socialism, fascism, crony capitalism, mercantilism, it's all the exact same thing.
[00:49:53.834 --> 00:50:06.979]  But you know, I think there's a lot of, uh, the way that these, uh, elitists that run this evil world, you know, they use a lot of lies and fear and, uh, to get people to go a certain direction.
[00:50:07.543 --> 00:50:12.226]  And of course they help motivate that fear by, you know, killing thousands and millions.
[00:50:12.666 --> 00:50:20.131]  I believe eventually these things are coming, that is nuclear exchanges and so forth, building gradually more and more.
[00:50:22.833 --> 00:50:25.874]  I mean, they've already killed tens of millions, you know, in the last century.
[00:50:26.174 --> 00:50:29.635]  The neocons are trying to set new rules of the game.
[00:50:29.655 --> 00:50:34.316]  They're saying to China and Russia and to other countries, hey, we can now use nukes.
[00:50:34.416 --> 00:50:35.196]  You can, too.
[00:50:35.816 --> 00:50:37.717]  Let's start using them on third world countries.
[00:50:37.737 --> 00:50:39.397]  I mean, that's official policy.
[00:50:40.197 --> 00:50:42.478]  Love is death, and that's what it's coming to.
[00:50:42.518 --> 00:50:47.039]  We need to resist this and be pro-life, but the main thing is people need to get saved.
[00:50:47.079 --> 00:50:49.480]  Trust in the Lord Jesus Christ as a Savior, because
[00:50:51.149 --> 00:50:54.630]  I believe these are just conditioning things to let us know what's coming.
[00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:55.950]  I hear you, my friend.
[00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:56.810]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:58.851]  Warrior calls straight ahead.
[00:50:58.971 --> 00:50:59.471]  Stay with us.
[00:51:02.611 --> 00:51:03.071]  Hey, folks.
[00:51:03.171 --> 00:51:09.993]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:51:10.273 --> 00:51:15.014]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:51:15.234 --> 00:51:20.875]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:51:21.115 --> 00:51:25.638]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:51:25.858 --> 00:51:33.003]  The cashless society control grid, impenetrable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:51:33.023 --> 00:51:37.566]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.746 --> 00:51:40.247]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:51:40.488 --> 00:51:47.192]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:51:47.412 --> 00:51:52.674]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:52.694 --> 00:51:53.115]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:52:01.539 --> 00:52:09.063]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:52:09.343 --> 00:52:20.249]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:52:20.529 --> 00:52:22.311]  Yet require very little energy.
[00:52:22.591 --> 00:52:25.915]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:52:26.255 --> 00:52:36.706]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:52:37.006 --> 00:52:37.506]  That's right!
[00:52:37.686 --> 00:52:44.789]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:52:45.089 --> 00:52:49.211]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[00:52:49.371 --> 00:52:53.833]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:53.873 --> 00:52:54.333]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:03.393 --> 00:53:03.853]  Thank you.
[00:53:18.701 --> 00:53:19.341]  We're good to go!
[00:53:48.214 --> 00:53:51.315]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:51.476 --> 00:54:02.381]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:03.961 --> 00:54:10.004]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:10.605 --> 00:54:13.546]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:14.244 --> 00:54:27.667]  Halliburton, a company that openly hires illegal aliens by the tens of thousands for the New Orleans rebuilding, is going to run the camps and the security systems for the new ICE, the new Border Patrol Group.
[00:54:28.147 --> 00:54:28.667]  I'm not kidding.
[00:54:28.687 --> 00:54:29.588]  I have it right here in front of me.
[00:54:30.068 --> 00:54:36.469]  Also, we've got some really interesting economic indicators for you that are the real numbers, not the cooked ones that we get from the Feds.
[00:54:36.509 --> 00:54:37.729]  Well, these are Fed numbers, too.
[00:54:37.789 --> 00:54:40.170]  It's just not the cooked ones that they are out promoting.
[00:54:40.942 --> 00:54:41.542]  We'll get into that.
[00:54:41.902 --> 00:54:52.865]  Paul Watson, just with a ton of news, is going to be joining us coming up in the next hour to talk about world taxation, the big announcements from Davos, Switzerland, and the World Economic Forum right now.
[00:54:53.785 --> 00:54:59.447]  But one of my staff just popped in here, one of the crew, and said, Alex, don't forget PDD 60.
[00:55:00.447 --> 00:55:01.547]  And that is an important point.
[00:55:01.587 --> 00:55:03.628]  I meant to talk about that in my debate with John.
[00:55:04.868 --> 00:55:06.849]  Clinton signed Presidential Decision Directive 60.
[00:55:08.374 --> 00:55:18.243]  Which the declassified, redacted portion says, we will absorb nuclear strikes from China, Russia, Israel, Britain.
[00:55:19.725 --> 00:55:20.465]  It doesn't matter.
[00:55:22.027 --> 00:55:26.090]  There's another big nuclear power, of course, and that's South Africa.
[00:55:26.171 --> 00:55:26.911]  We have France.
[00:55:27.392 --> 00:55:31.155]  And it says, we will absorb strikes and then decide what to do.
[00:55:31.556 --> 00:55:34.058]  They took the launch codes off the subs and everything else.
[00:55:35.616 --> 00:55:45.083]  But, they've set the new policy of attacking defenseless third world countries that do not have these type of atomic WMDs.
[00:55:47.785 --> 00:55:50.146]  So, that's what's happening, that's what's going on.
[00:55:51.127 --> 00:55:53.108]  And it's just unbelievable.
[00:55:54.129 --> 00:55:59.353]  And I've heard the talk show host out there cheering, yeah, they're saying they might need to use some nukes!
[00:56:00.356 --> 00:56:02.459]  I think we ought to nuke Fallujah.
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:05.124]  Of course, it's Fallujah, but they like to say Fallujah.
[00:56:06.022 --> 00:56:07.442]  And you're like, oh, where is Fallujah?
[00:56:07.683 --> 00:56:08.863]  It's over there on our right.
[00:56:08.903 --> 00:56:09.663]  Where's our right?
[00:56:09.683 --> 00:56:13.144]  I mean, literally, you shouldn't have an opinion if you're ignorant.
[00:56:13.524 --> 00:56:14.465]  Shut up, Tommy.
[00:56:14.505 --> 00:56:18.906]  Well, I'm actually, for free market, Bush has spent more money than anyone else before him combined.
[00:56:19.346 --> 00:56:21.007]  Well, sometimes you just got to.
[00:56:21.027 --> 00:56:25.048]  Yeah, but most of it's big government spending, big liberal programs.
[00:56:25.408 --> 00:56:27.669]  Well, I guess that's good then.
[00:56:27.689 --> 00:56:31.450]  And, you know, I make fun of that type of individual, but there are a lot of them.
[00:56:31.952 --> 00:56:33.273]  They don't care about this country.
[00:56:33.293 --> 00:56:38.797]  They just want to drive around listening to, you know, neocons and feeling good about themselves.
[00:56:39.198 --> 00:56:40.719]  America doesn't matter to them.
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:43.601]  And I, for one, am sick of it.
[00:56:43.861 --> 00:56:46.804]  Let's go ahead and talk to Andy in North Carolina.
[00:56:46.924 --> 00:56:47.804]  Andy, thanks for holding.
[00:56:48.025 --> 00:56:48.325]  Welcome.
[00:56:48.725 --> 00:56:50.366]  Hey Alex, great to be on the air with you.
[00:56:51.407 --> 00:56:51.788]  Are you there?
[00:56:51.848 --> 00:56:52.368]  Yes, I am.
[00:56:52.548 --> 00:56:53.369]  Okay, great, great.
[00:56:53.409 --> 00:56:54.770]  Hey, you just kind of stole my thunder.
[00:56:54.790 --> 00:56:57.292]  I was going to mention the fact that America will absorb
[00:56:57.901 --> 00:56:59.021]  We're good to go.
[00:57:17.463 --> 00:57:20.384]  And everybody at work's like, Andy's always six months to a year ahead of what's going on.
[00:57:20.404 --> 00:57:23.744]  You know, he used to think he was crazy, but now, you know, hey man, he's really on to stuff.
[00:57:24.024 --> 00:57:31.346]  No, I mean, that's the thing, is that once you know the news, you'll make more money in the stock market, you'll make more money in real estate.
[00:57:31.606 --> 00:57:36.307]  I mean, for people that just want to make money, and, I mean, knowing what's going on is valuable.
[00:57:36.727 --> 00:57:39.968]  Not just for living in a free society, but just for business.
[00:57:40.368 --> 00:57:46.749]  Well, I think this is it, but I would, I don't, there's a lot of this stuff that's going on that I wouldn't want to personally profit from, just because, you know, I object to it.
[00:57:47.185 --> 00:57:48.506]  But I hate to be pessimistic.
[00:57:48.546 --> 00:57:49.587]  I've always been optimistic.
[00:57:49.607 --> 00:57:54.012]  But I tell you what, it dawned on me yesterday on the grand global chessboard of what's going on.
[00:57:54.032 --> 00:57:55.693]  And I've been turned right around.
[00:57:55.753 --> 00:57:57.695]  You and Jeff Brents were talking about the same thing last night.
[00:57:57.715 --> 00:57:58.576]  My wife's like, wow.
[00:57:58.977 --> 00:58:06.444]  You know, she goes, they brought up the same thing you did, is that I am extremely afraid right now that Russia and China are going to nuke us completely into oblivion.
[00:58:06.883 --> 00:58:12.408]  And it makes sense, too, because if you look at the whole thing, if you look at history, Germany was very powerful within Europe.
[00:58:13.489 --> 00:58:15.891]  And they had to be taken down.
[00:58:15.931 --> 00:58:19.414]  And pure greed and the fascism and Hitler brought down Germany.
[00:58:19.454 --> 00:58:22.357]  And the same thing is happening here in the United States right now, as we speak.
[00:58:22.397 --> 00:58:25.459]  Well, I don't know if we're going to get nuked by Russia and China, but I know this.
[00:58:25.599 --> 00:58:27.181]  We are being set up to fall.
[00:58:27.241 --> 00:58:30.644]  We are being set up to be demonized and then to fall
[00:58:31.511 --> 00:58:34.514]  When the whole time we were used as a shill to build up the New World Order.
[00:58:34.794 --> 00:58:35.635]  Great points, Andy.
[00:58:35.655 --> 00:58:36.796]  Good to have you on board with us.
[00:58:37.397 --> 00:58:39.158]  Charles and Linda and others, you're up next.
[00:58:39.178 --> 00:58:40.239]  And we'll get Paul Watson on.
[00:58:41.741 --> 00:58:45.644]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[00:58:45.964 --> 00:58:46.765]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:58.223 --> 00:59:02.407]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:03.067 --> 00:59:03.868]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.628 --> 00:59:05.549]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.190 --> 00:59:09.873]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.373 --> 00:59:14.457]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:28.751 --> 00:59:45.869]  By the way, we've had Yahoo Instant Message for years here in the office, but I thought, you know, why not go ahead and let the listeners start instant messaging me when I'm on air with questions or comments, and if they're short and
[00:59:47.693 --> 00:59:49.934]  You know, somewhat easy to cover.
[00:59:50.194 --> 01:00:09.647]  I will mention quite a few of those on the air, because I always print up emails and rarely end up covering them on air, but I will, especially if it's on topic, the specific topic we're talking about at the time, cover your instant messages here on air, and there's a link to that up on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:00:09.747 --> 01:00:13.870]  Paul Watson is going to join us in a few minutes to talk about the Davos Economic Forum.
[01:00:14.924 --> 01:00:26.751]  World Economic Forum, and they're calling again and giving us more details of the world taxation grid that's going to fix all our problems if we'll just have a world government and a world taxation system.
[01:00:27.651 --> 01:00:35.793]  We'll also get into the Iran situation and how it ties into China and Russia, and there's a lot of other Big Brother news and economic news we'll be covering.
[01:00:36.153 --> 01:00:38.914]  Right now, let's go to Charles in Louisiana.
[01:00:39.294 --> 01:00:40.374]  Charles, you're on the air.
[01:00:40.414 --> 01:00:40.874]  Go ahead.
[01:00:41.034 --> 01:00:41.754]  What's up, Mr. Jones?
[01:00:42.194 --> 01:00:52.877]  I just want to report, I don't know if you've seen it on the world news, all the tunnels from Mexico to Texas, they bring in so much dope in, they just got these tunnels that run for miles.
[01:00:53.887 --> 01:00:56.248]  Well, the government knows where almost every one of them is.
[01:00:56.448 --> 01:00:58.309]  They're just showing you a few of them right now.
[01:00:58.369 --> 01:01:09.314]  And again, they've got these TSA Viper teams in the middle of the country searching little old ladies, but oh, we can't stop all the illegal aliens that are pouring into the country.
[01:01:09.374 --> 01:01:13.416]  It just illustrates what a complete fraud the fake war on terror is.
[01:01:13.956 --> 01:01:16.037]  Well, I tell you, I don't know what the answer is.
[01:01:16.137 --> 01:01:17.598]  People ask me all the time.
[01:01:17.658 --> 01:01:20.219]  I mean, I'm talking about 20 times a day when I give them a tape.
[01:01:21.179 --> 01:01:22.399]  What can we do about this?
[01:01:22.439 --> 01:01:23.460]  What can we do about this?
[01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:28.481]  They say, we'll get involved, pass these tapes out, go to the meetings, organize meetings.
[01:01:29.101 --> 01:01:34.583]  Mr. Jones, I'm so discouraged with the way this government's being run.
[01:01:34.903 --> 01:01:38.404]  I just feel like I'm hiding myself, just digging a hole and hiding myself.
[01:01:39.104 --> 01:01:42.425]  You know, I've been in this seven years, and I just don't see we're getting any headway.
[01:01:43.118 --> 01:01:53.061]  Well, I mean, I gotta tell you, Charles, I've seen a lot of people wake up, I've seen a lot of issues turn our way, I've seen a lot of people come around to our view.
[01:01:53.541 --> 01:01:57.862]  The old political roadmaps and order is being shattered.
[01:01:58.362 --> 01:02:00.043]  The false paradigm is being broken.
[01:02:00.943 --> 01:02:06.724]  And so I know it's frustrating to see all these things that are going on, but at least now people know about the tunnels.
[01:02:06.785 --> 01:02:09.105]  At least now people know about Halliburton.
[01:02:09.145 --> 01:02:12.906]  At least people know about the Federal Reserve being private run for profit.
[01:02:13.306 --> 01:02:17.027]  I mean, listen, I talk about this every day because it's such positive news.
[01:02:17.827 --> 01:02:19.187]  Crazy Alex Jones!
[01:02:19.227 --> 01:02:21.168]  The radical isn't so radical today!
[01:02:21.812 --> 01:02:23.914]  Well, nobody calls you crazy as I know of.
[01:02:23.994 --> 01:02:26.176]  Well, I know that, but I mean, maybe ten years ago.
[01:02:26.236 --> 01:02:29.699]  My point is that we really are the mainstream.
[01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:39.108]  And the fact that we're being more and more accepted as quote mainstream shows that the New World Order's propaganda program is in deep trouble.
[01:02:39.709 --> 01:02:41.070]  Yeah, and I want to say something.
[01:02:41.110 --> 01:02:43.933]  See all this deal in New Orleans, they're stealing these people's property.
[01:02:44.611 --> 01:02:50.756]  Mr. Jones, I've been talking to people that are going to the gun shops, saying how the police said, if you don't give me a gun, we're going to shoot you, and all that.
[01:02:50.797 --> 01:02:53.939]  People don't want to believe that, but they'll do anything they want.
[01:02:53.979 --> 01:02:55.040]  They'll threaten you anyway.
[01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:57.382]  They'll come in your house and threaten you any way you want.
[01:02:58.043 --> 01:03:01.426]  These policemen and this military we got are so corrupt.
[01:03:01.786 --> 01:03:04.569]  The other day, this Guatemalan film beat another man in another state.
[01:03:05.189 --> 01:03:10.554]  As far as the military, I don't think they know which way is up anymore.
[01:03:11.099 --> 01:03:12.321]  What's your opinion on our military?
[01:03:12.381 --> 01:03:18.109]  Well, I know they even went into the million-dollar home areas where we're high and dry with power and just said, give us your guns.
[01:03:18.329 --> 01:03:18.590]  Yes.
[01:03:18.830 --> 01:03:21.874]  First thing they did, we're not going to bring you food and water, we're coming for your guns.
[01:03:21.994 --> 01:03:25.079]  And I bet you half of them were foreign troops because they were all masked.
[01:03:26.559 --> 01:03:28.981]  Well, yeah, men driving around in black masks.
[01:03:29.041 --> 01:03:31.804]  We know that they're Dutch, Mexican, and British troops.
[01:03:32.064 --> 01:03:32.284]  Yes, sir.
[01:03:32.525 --> 01:03:32.945]  That's true.
[01:03:33.205 --> 01:03:35.988]  Well, thank you for what you're doing, Mr. Jones, and God bless you, son, and your family.
[01:03:36.308 --> 01:03:36.648]  Thank you.
[01:03:36.688 --> 01:03:37.389]  God bless you, too.
[01:03:37.789 --> 01:03:46.758]  We'll come back with Paul Joseph Watson from the United Kingdom on this Live Tuesday edition, the final day of the first month of 2006.
[01:03:46.898 --> 01:03:49.260]  It's flown past us.
[01:03:49.821 --> 01:03:50.982]  Check out InfoWars.net.
[01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:57.861]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:58.121 --> 01:03:59.702]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:04:00.042 --> 01:04:04.724]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:05.064 --> 01:04:09.486]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:04:09.907 --> 01:04:14.128]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:04:14.308 --> 01:04:15.529]  The Constitution has been shredded.
[01:04:15.729 --> 01:04:17.170]  And America is now a police state.
[01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:21.892]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:22.112 --> 01:04:26.514]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.754 --> 01:04:33.978]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:04:54.033 --> 01:04:57.515]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.
[01:04:57.775 --> 01:05:01.276]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:05:01.376 --> 01:05:05.318]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:05:05.538 --> 01:05:11.701]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:05:12.101 --> 01:05:20.025]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:05:20.445 --> 01:05:25.769]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:05:25.929 --> 01:05:29.692]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:30.072 --> 01:05:31.914]  And the Black Berkey Filters are recleanable.
[01:05:31.974 --> 01:05:34.156]  Simply brush them up with a Scotch-Brite pad.
[01:05:34.396 --> 01:05:39.339]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.

[01:05:48.306 --> 01:05:52.149]  That's 808-803-4438 and protect your family.
[01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:54.430]  Hey folks, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:05:54.770 --> 01:05:58.713]  You've all heard me on the radio talking about the importance of investing in precious metals.
[01:05:59.093 --> 01:06:02.616]  I feel it's time for me to talk about the importance of investing in your health.
[01:06:02.996 --> 01:06:06.558]  I was presented with the opportunity to try Tri-Vibes from TriVortex.
[01:06:06.959 --> 01:06:11.802]  I was a bit hesitant of the idea of absorbing vitamins by wearing them rather than ingesting them.
[01:06:12.142 --> 01:06:17.927]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[01:06:18.248 --> 01:06:21.951]  I now wear my TriVides bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever.
[01:06:22.311 --> 01:06:24.393]  Not only physically, but also mentally.
[01:06:24.714 --> 01:06:30.499]  TriVortex also offers amazingly beneficial and beautiful jewelry worn by the women around the office daily.
[01:06:30.919 --> 01:06:32.100]  TriVortex is amazing.
[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:33.541]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:06:33.621 --> 01:06:39.026]  Try TriVortex yourself and have fun and learn with the test found on TriVortex.com.
[01:06:39.226 --> 01:06:42.689]  That's T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com.
[01:06:42.969 --> 01:06:44.290]  Or call my friend Brian at 619-884-1455.
[01:06:44.330 --> 01:06:44.610]  That's 619-884-1455.
[01:06:58.346 --> 01:06:58.987]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.647 --> 01:07:00.708]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.409 --> 01:07:02.530]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:04.011]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.751 --> 01:07:05.752]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:06.333 --> 01:07:10.056]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.496 --> 01:07:14.600]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:20.521 --> 01:07:23.602]  Well, people are very scared.
[01:07:23.642 --> 01:07:28.063]  They've heard the word nuclear over and over again in association with Iran.
[01:07:28.423 --> 01:07:32.524]  Meanwhile, Communist China threatens to nuke almost every major U.S.
[01:07:32.564 --> 01:07:32.884]  city.
[01:07:32.924 --> 01:07:33.864]  Well, not almost every.
[01:07:34.684 --> 01:07:35.545]  Hundreds of U.S.
[01:07:35.585 --> 01:07:37.545]  cities, and that's every major city in this country.
[01:07:38.554 --> 01:07:40.836]  Even a lot of towns you wouldn't say were that big.
[01:07:40.876 --> 01:07:44.820]  I mean, there are towns of 200,000 people that are on that list.
[01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:46.281]  But that's not a threat.
[01:07:46.321 --> 01:07:47.762]  I mean, they've got the power to do it.
[01:07:47.802 --> 01:07:49.163]  They're saying they may do it.
[01:07:49.563 --> 01:07:55.949]  Let's move all our industry over there and let them buy all our debt and then dump the dollar and tank our currency and...
[01:07:56.807 --> 01:07:58.189]  Give them the Panama Canal.
[01:07:58.609 --> 01:07:58.830]  U.S.
[01:07:58.890 --> 01:08:03.836]  companies don't even bid on that and let them move military bases into the Caribbean, into the Bahamas.
[01:08:04.197 --> 01:08:05.578]  That's not a problem.
[01:08:05.598 --> 01:08:06.760]  They're just threatening to kill us.
[01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:14.209]  But those Iranians that have rolled over to us for so long, well now they've said that if they're attacked, they'll fight back.
[01:08:14.309 --> 01:08:15.451]  How dare them!
[01:08:17.296 --> 01:08:20.658]  And Iran is saying that since they're being referred to the U.N.
[01:08:20.739 --> 01:08:24.521]  for military sanctions or economic sanctions that they're ending diplomacy.
[01:08:24.561 --> 01:08:25.342]  It's all a fraud.
[01:08:25.562 --> 01:08:26.363]  And it was a fraud!
[01:08:26.703 --> 01:08:27.403]  It is a fraud!
[01:08:28.824 --> 01:08:31.406]  And so now things move forward.
[01:08:31.426 --> 01:08:32.047]  Meanwhile the U.N.
[01:08:32.147 --> 01:08:42.434]  unveils plan to release untapped wealth of 7 trillion a year and solve the world's problems at a stroke.
[01:08:43.681 --> 01:08:45.503]  Yes, imagine what the U.N.
[01:08:45.523 --> 01:08:47.304]  can do with double the federal budget.
[01:08:48.245 --> 01:08:51.187]  With $7 trillion a year, I'm sure they could do wonders for us.
[01:08:51.788 --> 01:08:52.268]  The U.N.'
[01:08:52.228 --> 01:08:53.429]  's just wonderful.
[01:08:53.729 --> 01:08:59.634]  Why, in Burma, they engaged in mass murder, killing the aborigines, forcing them out for a U.N.
[01:08:59.674 --> 01:09:00.435]  biosphere.
[01:09:00.475 --> 01:09:09.442]  Down in Costa Maya, Mexico, back in the early 90s, they openly forced all the people off their land, and then promised it'd be a biosphere, and then built hotels on it.
[01:09:09.992 --> 01:09:11.074]  That's just such a scam.
[01:09:11.554 --> 01:09:14.458]  Al Qaeda is propagandizing for Bush on the eve of the State of the Union.
[01:09:14.859 --> 01:09:22.249]  Every time, at every opportune point, Al Qaeda pops up and agrees with Bush and helps him and supports him and they should, they're CIA.
[01:09:24.033 --> 01:09:25.014]  And we'll get into the U.N.'
[01:09:24.994 --> 01:09:27.776]  's promise to save the world and return for global government.
[01:09:27.796 --> 01:09:31.358]  Paul Watson's written two good articles yesterday about this.
[01:09:31.378 --> 01:09:32.219]  We're going to be going over it.
[01:09:32.619 --> 01:09:38.983]  OPEC saying Iran won't halt oil production, even though they're being threatened with a nuclear attack by now that evil Frenchie Jacques Chirac.
[01:09:39.003 --> 01:09:41.365]  See, that was all good cop, bad cop staged, folks.
[01:09:41.705 --> 01:09:42.726]  They're all getting together now.
[01:09:43.246 --> 01:09:43.806]  It's okay.
[01:09:43.886 --> 01:09:46.068]  Iran will keep pumping oil to us because they're so evil.
[01:09:46.588 --> 01:09:50.831]  And Putin touts Russian missile capabilities, how he can hit us and all the things he can do.
[01:09:50.871 --> 01:09:51.992]  But again, that's okay.
[01:09:52.632 --> 01:09:53.733]  It's those evil Iranians.
[01:09:53.753 --> 01:09:56.334]  They've got to be dealt with.
[01:09:56.694 --> 01:10:03.077]  Rapid consumer spending helps push the savings rate to the lowest level since the depth of the Depression.
[01:10:04.958 --> 01:10:08.580]  The low point of the Depression, the depths of it, was 1933.
[01:10:09.521 --> 01:10:12.462]  And that's what we've now hit, this out of the Associated Press.
[01:10:12.742 --> 01:10:15.824]  And now your monthly credit card payment is going to be doubled.
[01:10:16.654 --> 01:10:30.263]  We'll be going over some of that in the attack on free speech on the web and a lot more as Big Brother moves against the population of the planet while trying to distract the population with little staged wars along the way.
[01:10:30.724 --> 01:10:33.806]  False catalyzers or unifiers.
[01:10:34.306 --> 01:10:37.108]  Paul Watson, joining us from Sheffield, England.
[01:10:37.528 --> 01:10:38.389]  Welcome, my friend.
[01:10:39.049 --> 01:10:39.610]  Hello, Alex.
[01:10:39.710 --> 01:10:40.430]  Good to be back.
[01:10:41.191 --> 01:10:42.292]  It's good to have you with us.
[01:10:42.412 --> 01:10:43.833]  Paul, so much is going on.
[01:10:43.873 --> 01:10:45.534]  What do you want to plunge into first?
[01:10:46.611 --> 01:11:00.858]  I think with the State of the Union happening tonight, it's salient to get into the Al-Qaeda propaganda pitch for Bush with the release of these two audio and videotapes over the last two weeks.
[01:11:01.218 --> 01:11:07.442]  Always at two minutes to midnight, right when Bush needs support, they pop up and there's been university studies.
[01:11:07.722 --> 01:11:09.503]  His approval rating goes up each time.
[01:11:10.043 --> 01:11:12.264]  Just like when Bush needs help, Clinton will attack him.
[01:11:12.324 --> 01:11:14.965]  That then gets his base to unify around him.
[01:11:15.005 --> 01:11:16.026]  It's all part of the theater.
[01:11:17.409 --> 01:11:19.629]  Well, yeah, it's like night follows day.
[01:11:19.909 --> 01:11:36.913]  I mean, the question is, if the source of these tapes is really Bin Laden and his right-hand man, Al Zawahiri, why are they making the decision to release them at the most politically expedient time for the Bush administration?
[01:11:37.933 --> 01:11:44.254]  And we've got at least three major concrete examples of where this has happened in the past.
[01:11:45.374 --> 01:11:55.716]  Um, December 2001, the Bin Laden tape, supposedly admitting responsibility for 9-11, found in a house in Jalalabad.
[01:11:56.296 --> 01:12:01.557]  Um, it was physically located by anti-Taliban forces, it wasn't handed in by anyone.
[01:12:02.658 --> 01:12:10.019]  Um, and it's just, uh, you know, the lucky find of a VHS tape in a house in a massive, sprawling city.
[01:12:10.039 --> 01:12:14.300]  Um, and the government refused to give any more information than that.
[01:12:15.026 --> 01:12:21.089]  Obviously, the tape is a fat bin Laden with the wrong nose, the wrong facial structure.
[01:12:21.830 --> 01:12:27.293]  Um, he makes the mistake of praising two hijackers that later turn up alive.
[01:12:27.313 --> 01:12:29.033]  He gets the names wrong of others.
[01:12:30.074 --> 01:12:35.197]  Um, he says that the hijackers didn't know that they were about to die.
[01:12:35.837 --> 01:12:41.180]  And yet, at the same time, the FBI told us that they found the letters indicating the exact opposite of that.
[01:12:41.877 --> 01:12:53.186]  So right after 9-11, when the questions are starting to arise, two, three months after the event, we have the Bin Laden tape, which, you know, shuts down the hatches on it.
[01:12:55.028 --> 01:13:04.915]  Shortly before the bombing of Iraq, Colin Powell tells the Senate, quote, a Bin Laden tape is coming, proving Iraq's links with Al-Qaeda.
[01:13:05.876 --> 01:13:06.677]  And this was
[01:13:07.370 --> 01:13:11.672]  Almost a week before Al Jazeera actually got the tape and it aired.
[01:13:11.932 --> 01:13:19.776]  Yeah, the press all ran out going, he said it's on TV now, so he got his notes wrong from the PSYOP script, and we know Al Jazeera is their front.
[01:13:20.057 --> 01:13:26.600]  We know that little thing about Bush wanting to bomb it is meant to give them more credibility, because a lot of Arabs are now saying it's a front.
[01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:30.162]  I mean, David Frost has a show on it, for heaven's sake.
[01:13:30.202 --> 01:13:32.343]  I mean, this is totally staged.
[01:13:33.443 --> 01:13:34.144]  Well, exactly.
[01:13:36.116 --> 01:13:39.559]  Al Jazeera acquires the tape and it says exactly that.
[01:13:39.579 --> 01:13:44.743]  Bin Laden's talking about standing with the Iraqis amidst an alliance with Saddam.
[01:13:45.484 --> 01:13:48.667]  So it's basically a gift-wrapped present for the neocons.
[01:13:48.687 --> 01:13:52.851]  They tried to create that myth with this Mohammed Atta.
[01:13:53.251 --> 01:13:54.112]  Well, I want to go back.
[01:13:54.192 --> 01:13:56.835]  I want to go back, though, to the fat Bin Laden.
[01:13:56.875 --> 01:13:59.237]  I mean, it's a guy who looks nothing like him.
[01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:03.121]  He is in a dark room.
[01:14:03.161 --> 01:14:04.762]  His nose is twice the size.
[01:14:05.102 --> 01:14:08.784]  He suddenly gained 150 pounds, maybe 175 pounds.
[01:14:09.384 --> 01:14:11.826]  And then they did voice print analysis that's 100%.
[01:14:11.866 --> 01:14:16.208]  You take a real Bin Laden tape, a real Bin Laden video with audio.
[01:14:16.468 --> 01:14:19.529]  You create a biometric voice print key.
[01:14:19.549 --> 01:14:20.650]  It's 100%.
[01:14:21.010 --> 01:14:23.091]  Then they compared the fat Bin Laden.
[01:14:23.211 --> 01:14:25.152]  It wasn't even the same person.
[01:14:25.512 --> 01:14:29.134]  Then they had linguists listen to it, and it was a western person.
[01:14:29.834 --> 01:14:34.696]  Uh, who was well-trained but trying to act like they'd actually been raised in the Middle East.
[01:14:34.756 --> 01:14:38.557]  So, and that was experts in Canada, France, and the U.S.
[01:14:38.577 --> 01:14:39.797]  that looked totally fake.
[01:14:40.077 --> 01:14:46.159]  Now, all these other tapes have turned out to have been fake, or four- and five-year-old tapes re-edited together.
[01:14:46.179 --> 01:14:52.681]  Right, and the Bin Laden one, he's writing with his left hand when he's right-handed.
[01:14:53.281 --> 01:14:56.822]  He's wearing a gold ring on one hand, which is forbidden by Muslim law.
[01:14:58.411 --> 01:15:03.792]  It's as if they left clues to be intentionally discovered, because it's such a sloppy job.
[01:15:04.832 --> 01:15:10.814]  I mean, we saw Forrest Gump shaking hands with President Kennedy ten years ago, and that looked real.
[01:15:11.674 --> 01:15:21.276]  There's adverts on British television now where fat media personalities' heads are superimposed on skinny models' bodies, and it looks completely real.
[01:15:21.296 --> 01:15:23.556]  So they could have done a much better job.
[01:15:25.337 --> 01:15:27.457]  Then again, four days before the election,
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:30.061]  The polls were kind of deadlocked.
[01:15:30.081 --> 01:15:37.526]  Bin Laden releases the videotape that sounds like a DVD extra from Fahrenheit 9-11.
[01:15:37.906 --> 01:15:41.409]  Bush gets four approval points from it and wins the election.
[01:15:41.909 --> 01:15:47.292]  Which is not to say that Kerry would have been any different, but that's the point where they chose who would win the election.
[01:15:48.053 --> 01:15:51.675]  Kerry himself blamed the Bin Laden tape for his defeat.
[01:15:51.695 --> 01:15:55.898]  Yeah, Walter Cronkite came out and said it was staged by the government.
[01:15:56.556 --> 01:15:59.197]  Yeah, he said it was a Karl Rove orchestrated set-up.
[01:16:00.418 --> 01:16:09.242]  So, three concrete examples of where these tapes get released at precisely the right times, where they most benefit the government agenda.
[01:16:10.042 --> 01:16:17.806]  Well, it's like when Bush travels over to give a speech with Blair, there's magically, right as they give the speech one hour before, bombings in Turkey.
[01:16:17.826 --> 01:16:19.947]  I mean, it's just always the same.
[01:16:20.987 --> 01:16:22.548]  And they give a speech about terrorism.
[01:16:23.129 --> 01:16:25.812]  Yeah, that's when Bush visited the UK in November 2003.
[01:16:26.052 --> 01:16:33.018]  The HSBC building in Turkey was bombed and it basically formed the foundation of Bush's speech.
[01:16:33.078 --> 01:16:37.162]  So they work it in as these events unfold.
[01:16:37.362 --> 01:16:47.852]  And now right before the State of the Union, Bin Laden the previous week and yesterday Al Zawahiri playing their role in releasing the tapes or at least appearing to release them.
[01:16:49.384 --> 01:16:52.685]  And again, you read the transcripts of the Bin Laden tape.
[01:16:52.785 --> 01:16:58.507]  He's personally recommending left-wing books about US empire building.
[01:16:59.567 --> 01:17:06.889]  Bin Laden, this is a guy who, when visited by mainstream journalists in the late 90s, didn't even have a newspaper to read.
[01:17:07.229 --> 01:17:08.790]  Never mind, you know, Western books.
[01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:13.751]  And they said he was completely unaware of any modern media whatsoever.
[01:17:14.907 --> 01:17:16.329]  So he's talking about Latin.
[01:17:16.349 --> 01:17:23.120]  And again, by doing that, by saying it's an empire, Bush is a big liar, now when anybody else says it, oh, you're with Bin Laden.
[01:17:23.661 --> 01:17:25.904]  Oh, you talk about empire, you're with Bin Laden.
[01:17:26.365 --> 01:17:27.567]  I mean it's so scripted.
[01:17:28.678 --> 01:17:29.338]  Yeah, I know.
[01:17:29.659 --> 01:17:36.062]  Meanwhile, the Bush administration with Buzzy Krongard and the CIA says, we don't want him, we don't want to capture him.
[01:17:36.122 --> 01:17:43.486]  Meanwhile, we've had all these special forces and CIA men on who were ordered not to stop him, not to catch him, not to capture him, not to go after him.
[01:17:43.506 --> 01:17:45.547]  I mean, all of this is happening.
[01:17:45.708 --> 01:17:49.209]  It's so ridiculously obvious.
[01:17:50.770 --> 01:17:53.512]  Well, yeah, 30th of March 2002, President Bush.
[01:17:54.492 --> 01:17:56.674]  I, quote, I don't know where he is.
[01:17:57.175 --> 01:18:00.358]  You know, I just don't spend that much time on him, to be honest with you.
[01:18:00.778 --> 01:18:01.939]  I don't know where he is.
[01:18:02.139 --> 01:18:04.402]  I am truly not that concerned about him.
[01:18:05.322 --> 01:18:12.609]  And then, a couple of weeks ago, he says, quote, when he says he's going to hurt the American people again, or try to, he means it.
[01:18:12.729 --> 01:18:16.433]  I take it seriously, and the people of the NSA take it seriously.
[01:18:17.159 --> 01:18:20.981]  So, flip-flopping from one to the other whenever it's politically expedient.
[01:18:21.141 --> 01:18:26.423]  Well, they even got up on the news on the eve of the Iraq War and said, no more Bin Laden, he's not the threat, it's Saddam.
[01:18:26.463 --> 01:18:30.965]  And suddenly, Bin Laden left TV and radio and print, and it was all Saddam.
[01:18:32.006 --> 01:18:34.607]  It's just, it's like the ten minutes of hate in 1984.
[01:18:34.947 --> 01:18:39.609]  It's just, this is the boogeyman, this is the bad man, he's gonna get you, give up all your rights.
[01:18:40.982 --> 01:18:50.332]  Alright, we'll come back and we'll get into world government, world taxation, and so much more with our guest, Paul Watson.
[01:18:50.673 --> 01:18:51.974]  I'm Alex Jones, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:18:54.409 --> 01:19:01.297]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[01:19:01.437 --> 01:19:14.371]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[01:19:14.551 --> 01:19:16.333]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[01:19:16.493 --> 01:19:19.974]  Are you tired of working so hard, yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[01:19:20.254 --> 01:19:24.036]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[01:19:24.296 --> 01:19:29.258]  Whatever it is you seek, Zango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[01:19:29.518 --> 01:19:31.218]  So take matters into your own hands.
[01:19:31.499 --> 01:19:35.480]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotion.
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:37.581]  Zango is what you are looking for.
[01:19:37.741 --> 01:19:40.322]  Find out more by calling 888-203-6633 or visit MangosteenMarkets.com

[01:19:52.165 --> 01:19:59.506]  Hi folks, Jack Browner from Midas Resources, the real money folks.
[01:20:02.807 --> 01:20:06.108]  Let's review a few things from the past year, November 2003 to November 2004.
[01:20:06.148 --> 01:20:06.908]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[01:20:12.330 --> 01:20:13.491]  A 5% increase.
[01:20:14.051 --> 01:20:18.474]  The dollar's value has dropped from 96 cents to 70 cents against the euro.
[01:20:19.114 --> 01:20:23.297]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[01:20:24.057 --> 01:20:26.138]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s.
[01:20:26.418 --> 01:20:29.680]  A 16% increase in real money.
[01:20:30.301 --> 01:20:33.322]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[01:20:33.903 --> 01:20:38.385]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:41.587 --> 01:20:44.268]  Remember, gold is liquid, private, and portable.
[01:20:44.928 --> 01:20:47.868]  Call now before your buying power shrinks even more dramatically.
[01:20:48.308 --> 01:20:49.929]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[01:20:49.989 --> 01:20:56.290]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:20:56.390 --> 01:21:00.511]  You know, Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:21:00.631 --> 01:21:03.532]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:21:03.592 --> 01:21:10.273]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:21:10.493 --> 01:21:13.498]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:21:13.718 --> 01:21:16.081]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:21:16.241 --> 01:21:26.396]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as atrazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[01:21:26.576 --> 01:21:35.701]  MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum aren't extracted.
[01:21:35.861 --> 01:21:43.606]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:21:43.626 --> 01:21:44.086]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:21:44.126 --> 01:21:45.827]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:21:54.193 --> 01:22:01.280]  Is black magic performed daily right in plain view on television, in movies, and in America's leading newspapers and magazines?
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:02.701]  I'm Tex Mars.
[01:22:03.121 --> 01:22:07.345]  My newest book, Codex Magicka, is a real eye-opener.
[01:22:07.365 --> 01:22:10.908]  624 pages, over 1,000 photographs.
[01:22:11.449 --> 01:22:20.297]  Codex Magicka shows the world's leading celebrities, from movie stars and presidents to bankers and senators, caught in the act.
[01:22:20.877 --> 01:22:24.522]  Discover the true secret signs of the Illuminati.
[01:22:24.803 --> 01:22:26.205]  Their mysterious symbols.
[01:22:26.545 --> 01:22:28.088]  Their hidden language.
[01:22:28.728 --> 01:22:29.590]  Encyclopedic.
[01:22:30.171 --> 01:22:30.791]  Documented.
[01:22:31.072 --> 01:22:35.158]  Codex Magicka unmask a conspiracy of immense evil.
[01:22:35.939 --> 01:22:45.321]  Please, order your personal copy of Codex Magicka on the internet at PowerOfProphecy.com or simply phone toll free 1-800-234-9673.
[01:22:45.341 --> 01:22:45.581]  That's 1-800-234-9673.
[01:22:45.601 --> 01:22:50.722]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:11.457 --> 01:23:14.600]  Here's an instant message on my Yahoo instant messenger.
[01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:24.570]  It says, I've been an avid reader of your site and mainstream news articles on politics, and my question for you is, do you actually believe that world domination is at hand?
[01:23:24.650 --> 01:23:28.074]  It's nearly impossible to control every human being on earth.
[01:23:28.574 --> 01:23:30.056]  You see, I don't believe it.
[01:23:30.376 --> 01:23:34.460]  The globalists are openly announcing it and openly shutting it up.
[01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:36.882]  All they have to do is build the parameters.
[01:23:36.942 --> 01:23:45.570]  It's like they just go put toll road readers on major existing highways and put a tracker chip in your inspection sticker and just start charging you.
[01:23:45.910 --> 01:23:47.651]  And if you don't pay them, they come arrest you.
[01:23:49.033 --> 01:23:51.555]  There's an example of tyranny.
[01:23:52.751 --> 01:23:55.793]  I mean, how did the Romans dominate the entire known world?
[01:23:55.833 --> 01:23:57.955]  How did the Japanese dominate their surrounding area?
[01:23:58.435 --> 01:23:59.476]  How did Hitler do it?
[01:23:59.576 --> 01:24:00.477]  It's what they do!
[01:24:01.658 --> 01:24:06.322]  And that's what this global government, global taxation, global treaties and armies are about.
[01:24:06.662 --> 01:24:10.565]  Paul Watson, for so many people, they're still in denial.
[01:24:10.625 --> 01:24:15.629]  It's like a world government being set up they think is still a conspiracy theory.
[01:24:17.191 --> 01:24:20.033]  Well, I think the kind of balance, the tipping point,
[01:24:20.965 --> 01:24:25.008]  Is... I mean, they've already eliminated most vestiges of freedom.
[01:24:25.549 --> 01:24:29.431]  Like, for example, in Britain, there is no freedom of speech.
[01:24:29.471 --> 01:24:37.698]  You go out and you practice freedom of speech and you are immediately apprehended under Section 44 of the terrorism law, which 119,000 people already have been since 2001.
[01:24:37.738 --> 01:24:38.678]  By the way, Paul, when we were out,
[01:24:45.063 --> 01:24:46.345]  That's what happened to us.
[01:24:52.671 --> 01:24:55.972]  And they were there with their video cameras up on the poles scanning us.
[01:24:56.452 --> 01:25:02.953]  And then now an activist was out peacefully standing with a big placard against the National ID card and they came over with cameras.
[01:25:02.993 --> 01:25:04.233]  We have photos on Prison Planet.
[01:25:04.593 --> 01:25:05.233]  It's in the news.
[01:25:05.293 --> 01:25:09.194]  Took video of him and said, we're putting you in a terror database.
[01:25:09.474 --> 01:25:18.816]  And meanwhile in the new Patriot Act, any type of government function, if you do go across any line or any free speech zone they say isn't there, felony time in prison.
[01:25:19.156 --> 01:25:19.856]  Absolutely!
[01:25:19.916 --> 01:25:20.596]  Go ahead, sorry.
[01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:26.372]  That's right, and the details, in the case of Britain, remain in the database forever.
[01:25:26.792 --> 01:25:31.494]  You never get out of them, which is obviously going to cause havoc for future travel plans and so forth.
[01:25:31.514 --> 01:25:48.302]  But again, this is an attempt at a chilling effect, because they're planning things so bad, they know even the docile American and British people are going to say, no, Paul, what is it they're planning, that they're trying to, I mean, how does that fight terrorists to not, to, to, to, to, to harass anybody protesting?
[01:25:49.605 --> 01:25:51.788]  Well, just think of the numbers, though.
[01:25:52.028 --> 01:25:54.591]  I mean, there's 60 million people living in Britain.
[01:25:55.372 --> 01:25:59.598]  At the height of the Iraq War protest, you had a million people marching in London.
[01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:06.384]  I'd guess at least half of those were one-off protests from people who weren't normally politically active.
[01:26:06.905 --> 01:26:10.607]  So say you've got 500,000 people in Britain who are politically active.
[01:26:11.108 --> 01:26:16.912]  Already, and this is before the London bombings because they don't include that data after mid-2005, 119,000 of those 500,000 have been put in a terrorism database.
[01:26:24.130 --> 01:26:27.871]  So it's like a third of the politically active people in Britain.
[01:26:27.971 --> 01:26:37.735]  And by the way, in New York it was the local bicycle club in a bike riding awareness just about a bike rider who was killed in traffic.
[01:26:37.875 --> 01:26:38.995]  Not even political!
[01:26:39.315 --> 01:26:43.477]  And they had a NYPD with CIA advisors inside.
[01:26:44.736 --> 01:26:47.138]  Yeah, I mean, not even really political.
[01:26:47.178 --> 01:26:56.686]  An author writes a book about homosexual adoption, goes on a radio program opposing it, gets a phone call from the police an hour later.
[01:26:56.986 --> 01:27:02.471]  What about the college student joking around with the cop on the horse going, your horse looks gay, and they arrest him?
[01:27:03.639 --> 01:27:11.585]  Oh yeah, but then people like Ann Coulter can write articles threatening to poison Supreme Court justices and it's all a big joke and nothing ever happens.
[01:27:12.826 --> 01:27:15.208]  O'Reilly can say, blow up the UN building?
[01:27:15.228 --> 01:27:18.010]  Yeah, attack San Francisco.
[01:27:18.130 --> 01:27:20.452]  He invites Al Qaeda to attack San Francisco.
[01:27:21.933 --> 01:27:23.054]  But why are they doing it?
[01:27:23.689 --> 01:27:29.391]  The ultimate goal, I'm more sure than ever, is they're going to detonate a tactical nuke in a major U.S.
[01:27:29.471 --> 01:27:29.831]  city.
[01:27:30.912 --> 01:27:37.214]  CBS News just had another big fear-mongering propaganda show about that on over the weekend, I believe.
[01:27:37.834 --> 01:27:42.496]  And then when it happens, they'll go, see, we warned you, we're smart, voter, give up all your rights to us!
[01:27:43.596 --> 01:27:49.258]  Yeah, and I believe the extension of the Patriot Act expires February 5th.
[01:27:49.738 --> 01:27:51.299]  I haven't confirmed that, but
[01:27:52.489 --> 01:27:54.870]  Obviously, that's the day of the Super Bowl this weekend.
[01:27:55.130 --> 01:27:55.830]  Yes, it does.
[01:27:56.370 --> 01:27:59.450]  So, we'll have to be very careful about an event happening there.
[01:28:01.191 --> 01:28:05.191]  And even if it doesn't happen, they admit that they issued terror alerts for political effect.
[01:28:05.291 --> 01:28:10.992]  It's still, just the threat of it has a similar psychological effect.
[01:28:11.112 --> 01:28:12.833]  There's just terrorists everywhere, Paul.
[01:28:13.593 --> 01:28:15.733]  Yeah, it's a worldwide media showcase.
[01:28:15.753 --> 01:28:19.334]  It's like the Olympics in 2008 or the World Cup this year.
[01:28:20.845 --> 01:28:27.169]  They create the police state, they have NATO AWACS flying over the cities, and the world, watching world media sees that.
[01:28:27.229 --> 01:28:31.131]  That's right, you're gonna have foreign, you're gonna have foreign German troops in London.
[01:28:31.871 --> 01:28:32.091]  Right.
[01:28:33.392 --> 01:28:35.493]  Well you need foreign troops, only they can keep you safe, Paul.
[01:28:35.793 --> 01:28:38.734]  Stay there, I wanna get into this, get into the call for world taxation.
[01:28:38.995 --> 01:28:42.476]  There's so much to talk about with Paul Watson, and we'll take your call, stay with us.
[01:28:44.457 --> 01:28:47.339]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.348 --> 01:28:51.013]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.657 --> 01:29:01.021]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:01.241 --> 01:29:06.244]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:29:06.565 --> 01:29:14.469]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:14.630 --> 01:29:21.674]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:21.874 --> 01:29:23.095]  There are no side effects.
[01:29:23.255 --> 01:29:26.638]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:29:26.698 --> 01:29:27.819]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:29:28.099 --> 01:29:29.380]  Eliminate the cause.
[01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:36.405]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:29:36.525 --> 01:29:38.967]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:29:39.147 --> 01:29:42.089]  For more information call Alternative Technologies toll free 866-885-6625.
[01:29:42.109 --> 01:29:42.149]  866-885-6625.
[01:29:42.169 --> 01:29:43.130]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:29:53.985 --> 01:29:55.966]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[01:29:56.046 --> 01:30:06.750]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:30:07.130 --> 01:30:11.652]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:30:11.712 --> 01:30:23.056]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, Radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:23.656 --> 01:30:30.498]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:30:30.878 --> 01:30:33.019]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:30:33.519 --> 01:30:38.500]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:44.942]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-888-9000.
[01:30:45.742 --> 01:30:45.882]  803-4438.
[01:30:45.922 --> 01:30:49.345]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:30:49.585 --> 01:30:52.447]  That's toll free.
[01:30:52.467 --> 01:30:53.187]  888-803-4438.
[01:30:54.728 --> 01:30:56.650]  You need your cup of coffee each morning, right?
[01:30:56.970 --> 01:30:58.711]  But you're not sure if it's right for your health.
[01:30:59.071 --> 01:31:00.312]  Now there's Gano Coffee.
[01:31:00.633 --> 01:31:05.316]  Gano Coffee is the new low-acid, low-caffeine, naturally healthy coffee.
[01:31:05.616 --> 01:31:13.822]  What makes Gano Coffee special is the secret ingredient Ganoderma, a concentration of red reishi mushroom, also known as the miraculous king of herbs.
[01:31:14.202 --> 01:31:17.685]  Known for its high nutritional value, Reishi packs a bigger punch than ginseng.
[01:31:17.965 --> 01:31:21.407]  Two to three packets of Ganno coffee can replace a whole pot of coffee.
[01:31:21.688 --> 01:31:27.011]  All-natural Ganno coffee tastes great and is the smart alternative for optimal health and longevity.

[01:32:18.088 --> 01:32:19.529]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:32:20.229 --> 01:32:25.491]  Linda, Mike and others, your calls are coming up.
[01:32:26.132 --> 01:32:36.296]  Paul, these are mainstream news articles that are on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com today, where you peacefully go out on the streets of London with a big
[01:32:37.134 --> 01:32:45.377]  A poster board that has a fake national ID card with his name on it, you know, to illustrate how it's violating your rights.
[01:32:46.157 --> 01:32:54.400]  And goons run over with video cameras and write down all your personal info and say you're going in a terrorist database.
[01:32:54.420 --> 01:32:56.621]  Now, that happened to me twice in London.
[01:32:56.801 --> 01:33:02.843]  Once when I was just peacefully there at the tube station where they shot the, uh, shot DeMendez.
[01:33:04.264 --> 01:33:07.266]  Now totally proven to be premeditated on purpose, why we don't know.
[01:33:08.047 --> 01:33:11.990]  And then another time when I was bullhorning Parliament, which wasn't going to be banned for another two days.
[01:33:12.010 --> 01:33:15.392]  They already passed a law to ban it, but it didn't go into effect for another two days.
[01:33:15.452 --> 01:33:17.894]  Just protesting their period, not just bullhorning.
[01:33:17.934 --> 01:33:21.357]  So I happened to drop by and saw a gigantic bullhorn and was salivating.
[01:33:21.737 --> 01:33:28.222]  Paul, tell folks what happened once the police heard me bullhorning, saying that 9-11 and 7-7 were inside jobs.
[01:33:29.503 --> 01:33:33.466]  Well, even though another individual had been doing it for about
[01:33:34.206 --> 01:33:44.664]  10 minutes previously he kind of was quiet and you couldn't hear him from across the street and then you started doing it and within literally about a minute two minutes
[01:33:45.385 --> 01:33:51.488]  The community support officers came over and took all your details.
[01:33:51.988 --> 01:33:57.031]  Tried to basically hang around, even though they had no reason for doing so after taking your details.
[01:33:57.131 --> 01:34:04.794]  Oh yeah, after they took the details and tried to intimidate me, gave me some weird ticket that I was in the database, they then would stand in front of it and keep trying to talk to me.
[01:34:05.295 --> 01:34:05.575]  Yeah.
[01:34:05.655 --> 01:34:10.157]  Because it's a free country, that's what the cop's job is to go out and stop people from protesting.
[01:34:11.177 --> 01:34:14.379]  Right, and they're also passing laws in Britain whereby
[01:34:15.271 --> 01:34:17.972]  Every offence is arrestable.
[01:34:18.912 --> 01:34:24.134]  Every arrest mandates direct inclusion into the DNA database.
[01:34:25.134 --> 01:34:33.057]  So you had a case of an 11-year-old girl who threw a snowball at a police car by accident.
[01:34:33.077 --> 01:34:34.717]  She was aiming, obviously, for somebody else.
[01:34:34.737 --> 01:34:36.398]  She threw a snowball at a police car.
[01:34:36.418 --> 01:34:40.859]  She was arrested and put in a DNA database for her entire life.
[01:34:42.340 --> 01:34:43.480]  So that's the way it's heading.
[01:34:44.324 --> 01:34:55.486]  And then they talk about, in this article, train spotters at one of the train stations near the Labour Party conference being detained and searched under the same laws.
[01:34:55.506 --> 01:35:08.089]  And, of course, the 80-somewhat-year-old guy who was thrown out by security goons, manhandled for heckling at the Labour Party conference, of which he was a member.
[01:35:08.829 --> 01:35:10.110]  Which has always been done.
[01:35:11.250 --> 01:35:11.470]  Yeah.
[01:35:12.279 --> 01:35:15.561]  And I mean, they drug him out by his hair, folks, a World War II veteran.
[01:35:16.561 --> 01:35:22.063]  But again, folks, it has nothing to do with terrorism.
[01:35:22.183 --> 01:35:25.725]  All over the Western world, they're going, hey, you can't protest anymore.
[01:35:25.945 --> 01:35:29.927]  Look, even scarier, I have the law here, we're going to dig it out later after we get into global taxation.
[01:35:31.287 --> 01:35:33.028]  And I saw it in this New Patriot Act.
[01:35:33.048 --> 01:35:34.589]  People kept saying, well it's not a New Patriot Act.
[01:35:34.629 --> 01:35:35.189]  Yes it is.
[01:35:35.690 --> 01:35:58.222]  It creates a federal police force through the Secret Service, radically expands them, and says that any of their deputies or designates, local police, state police, whatever, now, if you are anywhere, they can on the spot claim you are not in a free speech zone, protesting anywhere, and charge you with felonies for not following their directions instantly.
[01:35:58.968 --> 01:36:05.517]  So they can retroactively say you're not allowed to be protesting and then arrest you and charge you under felony terrorism charges.
[01:36:05.777 --> 01:36:07.559]  I mean, it's right here, mainstream news, folks.
[01:36:08.260 --> 01:36:14.729]  Again, what are they planning that's so bad that they're trying to put laws in place where there's no protesting or no resisting them?
[01:36:15.309 --> 01:36:15.950]  Well, I'll tell you.
[01:36:16.170 --> 01:36:23.954]  The Federal Reserve System has been set up where it is impossible for the general public to ever make enough money to get out of debt.
[01:36:24.335 --> 01:36:31.459]  It is, when you borrow money from the bank, they can loan out ten times the amount you, quote, have on deposit.
[01:36:31.759 --> 01:36:34.901]  They can loan out ten times even on the debt you have.
[01:36:35.241 --> 01:36:37.263]  It's zeros and ones in a computer.
[01:36:37.563 --> 01:36:38.823]  So where do they get wealth?
[01:36:38.984 --> 01:36:42.906]  By causing recessions and depressions.
[01:36:42.966 --> 01:36:44.407]  And Paul, I'm sure you've seen the article.
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:57.550]  It's up on InfoWars right now, out of the Star Tribune, it's an AP story, where they admit that we have the highest rate of debt since the depth, the low point, the worst part of the Great Depression in 1933.
[01:36:59.752 --> 01:37:02.414]  Meanwhile, though, Paul, we've got a great economy.
[01:37:03.395 --> 01:37:12.562]  Well, yeah, Bush is conservative, but he spent more on deficit spending than the entire previous 42 administrations put together.
[01:37:13.323 --> 01:37:14.544]  But he's a conservative.
[01:37:15.413 --> 01:37:20.394]  Well, I mean, what you were talking about earlier was why do some people still deny it?
[01:37:21.425 --> 01:37:27.949]  To most people, the idea of going out and actually protesting and using their freedom of speech is anathema.
[01:37:27.989 --> 01:37:33.392]  So, when you have laws that target individuals that do that, they don't batter an eyelid.
[01:37:33.912 --> 01:37:49.661]  It's kind of when the police state tightens its grip so much that it starts to regulate personal behavior, which is what you just talked about with the Federal Reserve, when people start to lose their pension funds and so forth, when people are getting tracked and taxed on the road.
[01:37:49.921 --> 01:37:51.181]  And by the way, they've changed the law.
[01:37:51.201 --> 01:37:53.062]  They've announced they're taking their pension funds.
[01:37:53.082 --> 01:37:54.622]  There is no ifs, ands, or buts about it.
[01:37:55.043 --> 01:37:56.283]  I mean, let me give people the newsflash.
[01:37:56.323 --> 01:37:57.203]  I'm not trying to scare you.
[01:37:57.583 --> 01:37:58.804]  It has been announced.
[01:37:59.044 --> 01:38:00.904]  They have changed the law three years ago.
[01:38:01.184 --> 01:38:02.185]  They are going to take them.
[01:38:02.545 --> 01:38:05.486]  And when you try to go out and protest, the cops are going to blow your heads off.
[01:38:06.986 --> 01:38:13.028]  Right, and the New Orleans model, which they're moving towards, is built for that.
[01:38:13.757 --> 01:38:13.897]  It's
[01:38:35.757 --> 01:38:37.758]  Well, I agree with you, Paul.
[01:38:37.778 --> 01:38:42.959]  I want to go to some calls in a few minutes, but let's get into global government, global taxation.
[01:38:42.999 --> 01:38:46.140]  The UN has announced, and this is how it works folks,
[01:39:00.351 --> 01:39:02.694]  Governments are now like vending machines.
[01:39:02.774 --> 01:39:03.996]  Big private corporations.
[01:39:04.036 --> 01:39:07.781]  Again, 44 of the 100 biggest economies are companies, not countries.
[01:39:08.822 --> 01:39:11.586]  So almost half, and some of the biggest are companies, not countries.
[01:39:12.227 --> 01:39:15.831]  Walmart's like now what the number 8 largest country, GDP wise.
[01:39:18.184 --> 01:39:27.850]  They go up to the government, the way it's been designed, they've gotten the laws changed, or in some cases ignore them, and they put their money into the slot and they pull the lever for what they want and it comes out.
[01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:38.457]  It's just like the Spanish government came and spent tens of millions of dollars, openly bought off the politicians, and then they handed over every major road in Texas to them, and they're all going to be toll roads.
[01:39:39.077 --> 01:39:42.058]  And it's going to be a living nightmare, and it's going to happen nationwide.
[01:39:42.138 --> 01:39:43.698]  Australian companies are getting some states.
[01:39:44.419 --> 01:39:47.119]  Most of the water districts are owned by German or Dutch companies now.
[01:39:47.719 --> 01:39:50.420]  I mean, it's all happening right now.
[01:39:51.380 --> 01:39:53.421]  And people don't understand this, that the U.N.
[01:39:53.461 --> 01:40:00.243]  tax model, they're going to cede governmental authority and taxation to private global corporations.
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:07.644]  I've been reading the text of the Davos Switzerland meetings, but don't believe Paul Watson's article that he wrote.
[01:40:07.985 --> 01:40:16.632]  You can go read the London Independent headline, UN unveils plan to release untapped wealth of $7 trillion and solve the world's problems at a stroke.
[01:40:18.854 --> 01:40:22.797]  Internet tax they want, money transfer tax, wellhead oil tax.
[01:40:24.076 --> 01:40:29.719]  There's all these new taxes, telecommunications taxes, and all of this will also be used to control behavior.
[01:40:29.759 --> 01:40:39.065]  So, the world government's forming, all these big CEOs are meeting, pushing it, and in the false political model they tell us, oh, CEOs don't like government.
[01:40:39.165 --> 01:40:39.885]  Baloney, folks.
[01:40:39.945 --> 01:40:43.287]  They're the ones, I mean the big ones, that are out lobbying for it.
[01:40:43.307 --> 01:40:50.352]  Paul, you wrote a great article about this called, UN's Promise to Solve the World and Return, to Save the World and Return for Global Government.
[01:40:50.372 --> 01:40:50.912]  Tell us about it.
[01:40:52.210 --> 01:41:00.081]  Well, yeah, and the foundation of it, as you just talked about, was the global tax, which is what the ID card is really fundamentally about.
[01:41:00.221 --> 01:41:05.528]  It's not just about the police walking up and demanding to see your papers.
[01:41:06.375 --> 01:41:07.996]  People say, well, what's the big deal?
[01:41:08.637 --> 01:41:11.478]  You know, in America, you take your driver's license everywhere.
[01:41:11.498 --> 01:41:13.239]  You have to show it to do anything anyway.
[01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:18.762]  And as we talked about with these powers in the UK, the police can demand to know who you are anyway.
[01:41:18.803 --> 01:41:24.466]  So the ID card, the biometric ID card, will be about direct taxation upon purchase.
[01:41:24.786 --> 01:41:28.048]  And that is the global tax model that it's eventually destined to become.
[01:41:28.308 --> 01:41:33.153]  Now they've openly announced this, but then they'll have their shills like Neil Bortz out and all these other neocons.
[01:41:33.574 --> 01:41:35.916]  Every show, we gotta have a sales tax, gotta have a sales tax.
[01:41:36.277 --> 01:41:46.868]  The federal model is we're gonna have state and national sales taxes, but because it's gonna be graduated for your income, everyone must swipe it to quote ensure that there's not
[01:41:47.168 --> 01:41:49.889]  Right, which is why they're now giving credit cards to nine-year-olds in Britain.
[01:41:50.129 --> 01:41:50.529]  It's all to
[01:42:12.139 --> 01:42:13.619]  Promote the cashless society.
[01:42:13.719 --> 01:42:17.140]  A nine-year-old has no business with a cell phone or credit cards.
[01:42:18.220 --> 01:42:36.045]  No, but to get into this UN thing, they're basically asking us to give up our nice lifestyles, live on subsistence level, and the United Nations promises to kind of create this utopian heaven on earth where worldwide disease and poverty is eliminated.
[01:42:36.085 --> 01:42:37.645]  By the way, they're actually saying that!
[01:42:38.005 --> 01:42:40.146]  And I've heard them snicker for years on NPR.
[01:42:40.546 --> 01:42:42.387]  We've had it too good for too long, folks.
[01:42:42.707 --> 01:42:45.429]  The economy, it isn't somebody wins, somebody loses.
[01:42:45.469 --> 01:42:49.531]  In a real economy, free market, everybody wins and the pie grows.
[01:42:49.871 --> 01:42:52.912]  This is about control of populations.
[01:42:52.952 --> 01:42:55.153]  A middle class is upwardly mobile.
[01:42:55.234 --> 01:42:56.014]  They can't have it.
[01:42:56.054 --> 01:42:56.734]  Paul, go ahead.
[01:42:57.995 --> 01:43:00.096]  Right, because it comes from the same crowd.
[01:43:00.689 --> 01:43:10.935]  That brought us the IMF and World Bank loans that were designed, and this was in their own documents, to keep the Third World locked in its own prison.
[01:43:10.955 --> 01:43:12.856]  So it never got the opportunity.
[01:43:12.956 --> 01:43:16.218]  Joseph Sikolich, the head of the World Bank, a chief economist, quit.
[01:43:16.258 --> 01:43:21.041]  We've now had other big international bankers, you know, write books like Economic Hitmen.
[01:43:21.261 --> 01:43:28.745]  I mean, folks, these are public documents where they call us slaves and talk about destroying the West and further annihilating the Third World.
[01:43:29.005 --> 01:43:29.946]  They are criminals!
[01:43:30.166 --> 01:43:30.586]  Openly!
[01:43:30.606 --> 01:43:31.447]  I'm sorry, Paul, go ahead.
[01:43:31.487 --> 01:43:39.492]  Yeah, that's why I find it odd that Stiglitz himself is promoting this so-called alternative, because it's the exact same poison.
[01:43:40.892 --> 01:43:51.859]  But the UN doesn't care about the fact that, you know, as he just said, it's self-evident that national sovereignty, free market capitalism and self-determination
[01:43:52.762 --> 01:44:07.707]  While not creating a utopia, because it's never possible, but they seem to think it is, they're the only models throughout history, from the pilgrims to whatever example you want to mention, that have ever proven successful in developing and maintaining a thriving economy.
[01:44:08.187 --> 01:44:18.950]  But they say, just sign over national sovereignty to them, admit the death of the nation-state, and in all their infinite wisdom, they'll redistribute the wealth and create their utopia.
[01:44:19.758 --> 01:44:21.679]  So how naive do they think we are?
[01:44:21.739 --> 01:44:31.062]  I mean, even if the United Nations were angels with a totally unblemished record, you would never create that pretext of concentrating power into so few hands.
[01:44:32.463 --> 01:44:40.366]  I've made a short list of the history of the United Nations in their noble quest to create a utopian planet.
[01:44:41.286 --> 01:44:45.507]  And I'm sure if you told that to the million-plus Iraqis, 500,000 of them children,
[01:44:47.555 --> 01:44:54.319]  Whose deaths were a direct result of the UN sanctions from 1990, then they would disagree.
[01:44:56.380 --> 01:45:04.524]  Remember the Madeleine Albright quote, a price worth paying, half a million dead kids by a result of the UN sanctions.
[01:45:05.843 --> 01:45:14.831]  Rwanda, 1994, when they withdrew the peacekeepers, an action that directly led to 800,000 people being butchered in a genocide.
[01:45:16.093 --> 01:45:24.441]  The prostitution, pedophilia, rape scandal, which has stretched from the Balkans right through Africa, including
[01:45:25.081 --> 01:45:26.842]  Notably Sierra Leone for that.
[01:45:27.162 --> 01:45:32.664]  Well, I mean, that's the thing, is that the UN in Burma and all over has been caught exterminating people.
[01:45:32.704 --> 01:45:35.044]  I mean, they even put it in National Geographic a few years ago.
[01:45:35.505 --> 01:45:44.648]  I opened National Geographic up and it says UN biosphere soldiers, it was somewhere, I think, like Malaysia, guard key rainforests.
[01:45:44.668 --> 01:45:46.008]  They kill anyone entering.
[01:45:46.068 --> 01:45:47.969]  I mean, it's just, oh, how loving liberal!
[01:45:48.009 --> 01:45:51.850]  You just kill anyone coming into this whole sector of forest
[01:45:52.450 --> 01:46:11.855]  And then at the same time, the UN runs around openly saying we'll use food as a weapon, and giving China awards as the model, when they're the most dehumanizing country out there, and then our own military-industrial complex in 1946, out at the Presidio, that's now the Gorbachev Center, openly shut up the UN!
[01:46:11.915 --> 01:46:13.215]  It's a total front!
[01:46:13.955 --> 01:46:16.376]  I mean, it has nothing but a murdering history!
[01:46:16.696 --> 01:46:21.117]  But the poor leftists think it's some alternative to the neocon cabal.
[01:46:22.759 --> 01:46:25.721]  Well, yeah, that's the card they're trying to play.
[01:46:26.022 --> 01:46:33.487]  Then you've got offshoots like UNESCO, which is part of the forced abortion program in China.
[01:46:33.727 --> 01:46:35.969]  Well, I've got to talk about the positive that Bush signed back onto.
[01:46:35.989 --> 01:46:37.430]  I've got to talk about something positive, Paul.
[01:46:37.450 --> 01:46:38.511]  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[01:46:40.112 --> 01:46:46.577]  Yeah, and I mean, you read UNESCO's own documents, and they're committed to the total abolition of private property rights.
[01:46:47.038 --> 01:46:51.381]  And they're kind of the main offshoot that the UN would use to promote these kind of agendas.
[01:46:52.151 --> 01:47:02.238]  So, as I wrote, common sense tells us that we shouldn't negotiate with purveyors of global genocide when they promised to create heaven on earth.
[01:47:03.419 --> 01:47:06.181]  Would you get in a car with Ted Bundy if he promised you a good time?
[01:47:06.241 --> 01:47:06.481]  No.
[01:47:07.502 --> 01:47:18.190]  Well, that's the thing, Paul, is that when you really try to stack up all the crimes of these gribs and their stated goals and all the evil things they've done, they shouldn't be wiping their own noses.
[01:47:19.308 --> 01:47:30.758]  I mean, they're just light years ahead of any evil we've ever seen, and then just because they've got the money to dole out, all the academics and the rest of them just prance around behind them.
[01:47:31.919 --> 01:47:33.300]  It's just heaven help us, Paul.
[01:47:35.101 --> 01:47:35.562]  Exactly.
[01:47:35.582 --> 01:47:43.148]  It's the same people that have engaged in the same mass deception time and time again to sell wars and manufacture crises, and then they tell us
[01:47:43.777 --> 01:47:45.298]  You know, just give us some more freedom.
[01:47:45.318 --> 01:47:46.998]  Just give us some national sovereignty.
[01:47:47.158 --> 01:47:51.480]  We promise we'll make everything all better when they're the ones that created the problems in the first place.
[01:47:53.141 --> 01:47:55.281]  I want to get your take on the Iran situation.
[01:47:55.321 --> 01:47:56.602]  I mean, I'm sure you've been listening to the show.
[01:47:56.622 --> 01:47:59.943]  We have China threatening to nuke us openly, but they're not a threat.
[01:47:59.963 --> 01:48:01.484]  Let's ship all the industry over there.
[01:48:01.744 --> 01:48:04.885]  Meanwhile, Iran's done nothing and they say, we'll defend ourselves.
[01:48:04.965 --> 01:48:09.307]  They go, they say if we nuke them, they were responding to Jacques Chirac saying he'd nuke them.
[01:48:10.087 --> 01:48:13.090]  Imagine a country of you nuke them, they say they'll fight back.
[01:48:13.170 --> 01:48:14.831]  Man, that's radical!
[01:48:14.891 --> 01:48:16.953]  Those people are off the hook!
[01:48:17.113 --> 01:48:17.754]  Vicious!
[01:48:18.374 --> 01:48:23.478]  I mean, again, if somebody walks up and starts punching you in the nose, you're not going to even defend yourself?
[01:48:23.538 --> 01:48:24.419]  I mean, that's bad?
[01:48:24.439 --> 01:48:34.167]  Well, if Chinese troops invaded Los Angeles, then would the American people have a right to defend themselves, or should we just all lay down and die?
[01:48:35.848 --> 01:48:37.590]  But Iran took the seals off.
[01:48:38.229 --> 01:48:41.792]  Even though they're the ones that voluntarily put them on in the first place.
[01:48:43.133 --> 01:48:51.460]  IAEA inspected Iran's facilities, said there was no agenda whatsoever to create nuclear bombs.
[01:48:52.521 --> 01:48:53.502]  They cannot do it!
[01:48:55.043 --> 01:48:58.286]  It is not the proper type of facility, they cannot do it!
[01:48:59.647 --> 01:49:06.833]  Yeah, I mean in comparison to North Korea, who have already got, some people say up to five, ten nuclear bombs.
[01:49:07.754 --> 01:49:13.159]  They fired a dummy missile which hit Alaska in the late 90s.
[01:49:13.179 --> 01:49:14.080]  Boy, that was kept quiet.
[01:49:14.721 --> 01:49:15.542]  That was kept quiet.
[01:49:17.263 --> 01:49:23.930]  And then the Iranian president comes out and says that Israel should be wiped off the map.
[01:49:24.835 --> 01:49:30.458]  Which is obviously a ridiculously stupid comment to make, but he's talking to his Muslim majority.
[01:49:30.478 --> 01:49:32.339]  There are only four routes to Israel.
[01:49:32.539 --> 01:49:35.401]  If Iran were to invade them, three of them are blocked off by U.S.
[01:49:35.441 --> 01:49:36.942]  troops, one by Turkish troops.
[01:49:37.042 --> 01:49:40.704]  It just would not be possible for Iran to invade Israel.
[01:49:40.764 --> 01:49:44.306]  Yeah, Iran isn't gonna invade across a thousand miles.
[01:49:44.326 --> 01:49:44.706]  It's just...
[01:49:45.581 --> 01:49:47.703]  It's just, it's just, it's total insanity.
[01:49:47.723 --> 01:49:49.885]  Alright, we'll be right back and take some calls.
[01:49:49.905 --> 01:49:51.606]  There's a lot of other news coming up, folks.
[01:49:51.626 --> 01:49:53.488]  There's just so much of it to chronicle.
[01:49:53.988 --> 01:49:55.509]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.690 --> 01:49:58.792]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.912 --> 01:50:02.816]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.876 --> 01:50:07.099]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:50:07.439 --> 01:50:11.223]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:11.363 --> 01:50:12.924]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:12.944 --> 01:50:16.646]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[01:50:16.686 --> 01:50:21.409]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.569 --> 01:50:24.591]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.791 --> 01:50:27.653]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:28.133 --> 01:50:34.257]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.777 --> 01:50:38.580]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[01:50:38.980 --> 01:50:40.341]  Order your video today.
[01:50:40.681 --> 01:50:41.742]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[01:50:41.762 --> 01:50:43.763]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[01:50:43.783 --> 01:50:45.344]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[01:50:53.636 --> 01:50:57.539]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:50:57.759 --> 01:51:03.204]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:03.484 --> 01:51:13.852]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:51:14.012 --> 01:51:18.356]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:51:18.476 --> 01:51:19.317]  We're good to go!
[01:51:33.530 --> 01:51:33.870]  I think so.
[01:51:55.046 --> 01:51:55.367]  I think so.
[01:52:10.328 --> 01:52:10.929]  I think so.
[01:52:30.506 --> 01:52:30.766]  I think so.
[01:52:58.836 --> 01:53:08.432]  The United Nations is just a smokescreen for a more sophisticated global empire controlled by the very same royalty that has tried it.
[01:53:09.111 --> 01:53:17.200]  Successfully, in many cases, in the past, the British Empire had over half the earth under its control for quite a while, and it's some of the same individuals in control today.
[01:53:17.220 --> 01:53:30.755]  If you want to understand who's behind 9-11, who's behind the terror, who's behind the police state that's being set up, you need to get the new combo deal, which he started offering yesterday, Webster Tarpley's incredible book, 500 plus pages with a very easy read.
[01:53:31.667 --> 01:53:32.508]  Amazing info.
[01:53:32.528 --> 01:53:35.890]  9-1-1 Synthetic Terror made in the USA.
[01:53:36.450 --> 01:53:40.333]  And with that, you get my new film, Martial Law 9-1-1 Rise of the Police State.
[01:53:40.413 --> 01:53:41.494]  It's really a mini-series.
[01:53:41.774 --> 01:53:42.675]  Three hours long.
[01:53:42.955 --> 01:53:43.856]  Three different films.
[01:53:43.896 --> 01:53:44.956]  An incredible documentary.
[01:53:45.317 --> 01:53:46.097]  Both of those for $29.95.
[01:53:47.578 --> 01:53:50.020]  By the way, Martial Law is $25 normally.
[01:53:50.420 --> 01:53:52.041]  So you're really getting Tarpley's book for about $5.
[01:53:52.622 --> 01:53:54.463]  And the book usually sells for about $18.
[01:53:54.783 --> 01:53:57.465]  And you can get it by itself for $17.95.
[01:53:57.505 --> 01:53:58.446]  You want the book by itself.
[01:53:59.456 --> 01:54:10.039]  And we've got my new film, The Order of Death, getting into the occult activities, the global elite, Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, the new footage inside Bohemian Grove, I shot last summer, just incredible stuff.
[01:54:10.679 --> 01:54:18.561]  That new film is out, when you get it, you get the original, but now updated, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove on the same DVD, or VHS, absolutely free.
[01:54:18.961 --> 01:54:21.322]  So a lot of great deals at InfoWars.com.
[01:54:21.662 --> 01:54:24.803]  Also go to PrisonPlanet.tv, where we have weekly TV reports.
[01:54:25.223 --> 01:54:30.927]  All my best audio interviews, my book, Paul Watson's book, a bunch of other documentary films, Loose Change 2 now going up there.
[01:54:31.007 --> 01:54:32.208]  They've authorized us to do that.
[01:54:32.948 --> 01:54:37.451]  And now, weekly reports inside the studio with our weekly in-studio guest.
[01:54:38.118 --> 01:54:42.840]  And going up today and tomorrow with the Tex Mars interview and the interview with David Stahl as well.
[01:54:42.860 --> 01:54:44.701]  Edited with documents and a lot of other things.
[01:54:44.761 --> 01:54:51.943]  We have former DEA agent who exposed government drug dealing coming on Friday, Celica Stillo.
[01:54:51.963 --> 01:54:56.085]  And that will be videotaped and put on there for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[01:54:56.105 --> 01:54:58.186]  15 cents a day for a monthly subscription.
[01:54:58.226 --> 01:54:59.266]  We have yearly subscriptions.
[01:54:59.286 --> 01:55:01.347]  You get three months free when you get a yearly subscription.
[01:55:01.647 --> 01:55:05.368]  And we'll have the two-year anniversary of PrisonPlanet.tv here in about a month and a half.
[01:55:05.408 --> 01:55:06.569]  So been up for quite a while.
[01:55:07.389 --> 01:55:09.330]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pieces of media.
[01:55:09.630 --> 01:55:12.591]  It's exclusive, it's great, and it makes this broadcast possible.
[01:55:12.872 --> 01:55:17.093]  PrisonPlanet.tv or get hard copies of all the films at InfoWars.com.
[01:55:17.774 --> 01:55:21.235]  Let's go ahead and go to some calls, Paul, and we'll get into more of the news in the next hour.
[01:55:21.935 --> 01:55:24.076]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in California.
[01:55:24.116 --> 01:55:25.297]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:55:25.357 --> 01:55:25.717]  Welcome.
[01:55:26.297 --> 01:55:30.139]  Yeah, Alex, I'd like to tell you something right off the top here.
[01:55:30.179 --> 01:55:31.580]  First of all, you're one of my heroes.
[01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:33.360]  Well, I'm flattered by that.
[01:55:33.380 --> 01:55:33.821]  I'm humbled.
[01:55:35.521 --> 01:55:37.962]  I want you to listen to an old man for a minute.
[01:55:39.442 --> 01:55:40.463]  You're in a key place.
[01:55:40.483 --> 01:55:41.943]  You're in a strategic place.
[01:55:42.763 --> 01:55:45.424]  And you're surrounded by agent provocateurs.
[01:55:46.585 --> 01:55:49.526]  And one of the things that they like to do is waste your time.
[01:55:50.446 --> 01:55:53.367]  And also, there is a fact that's coming down.
[01:55:53.547 --> 01:55:55.508]  We're going into a heavyweight fight.
[01:55:55.588 --> 01:55:58.469]  We're going into a world championship fight, my friend.
[01:55:58.489 --> 01:56:01.470]  And you have to take some time out.
[01:56:02.090 --> 01:56:04.771]  You don't have to worry about that flame burning out in you, son.
[01:56:05.470 --> 01:56:09.552]  You have to worry about being consumed by that flame, because that flame is Almighty God.
[01:56:10.493 --> 01:56:15.615]  And He's anointed you and appointed you to this time to do what you're doing.
[01:56:16.015 --> 01:56:18.697]  And my family and I, we pray for you every day.
[01:56:18.717 --> 01:56:24.700]  And you need to take and expel, especially time with your wife and your kids, whatever you can.
[01:56:25.815 --> 01:56:27.117]  I'll just leave you with that.
[01:56:27.177 --> 01:56:28.398]  My friend, keep up the work.
[01:56:28.458 --> 01:56:29.159]  God bless you.
[01:56:29.619 --> 01:56:31.000]  You're in our prayers day and night.
[01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:31.841]  We're going to be there.
[01:56:32.242 --> 01:56:34.604]  I just wish I had you with me here when it comes down.
[01:56:34.884 --> 01:56:36.746]  But they're taking the old girl down.
[01:56:37.247 --> 01:56:37.827]  You can see it.
[01:56:38.128 --> 01:56:40.230]  But she ain't going down without a fight, brother.
[01:56:40.530 --> 01:56:41.110]  God bless you.
[01:56:41.131 --> 01:56:42.051]  Well, God bless you.
[01:56:42.091 --> 01:56:43.273]  Wow, that's an amazing call.
[01:56:43.513 --> 01:56:47.217]  You know, we're all appointed and anointed if God calls us to fight evil.
[01:56:48.077 --> 01:56:48.977]  And I'm honored.
[01:56:48.997 --> 01:56:50.058]  I mean, I am blown away.
[01:56:50.278 --> 01:57:00.221]  I mean, I know I reach a lot of people, and it is a daunting task because I really don't have that high of a view of myself, but I ask God every day to help me do a better job, and we are frustrated.
[01:57:00.241 --> 01:57:02.282]  You know, Paul, I call you up all the time, and I go, we've got to do more.
[01:57:02.322 --> 01:57:03.762]  We've got to fight them more.
[01:57:03.802 --> 01:57:04.822]  We've got to expose them more.
[01:57:05.123 --> 01:57:09.304]  Does it ever frustrate you, Paul, just to not even be able to cover all the evil they're engaged in?
[01:57:10.416 --> 01:57:13.659]  Well yeah, that's why it's an organic movement and through what we do.
[01:57:14.020 --> 01:57:17.944]  Other people create their own media platforms, so that's how we cover everything.
[01:57:18.384 --> 01:57:20.607]  So we're just encouraging other people to do the same.
[01:57:21.548 --> 01:57:22.068]  Exactly!
[01:57:22.108 --> 01:57:26.373]  You know, so many people want to quote Truth Movement, want to just be these little piggies all to themselves.
[01:57:26.533 --> 01:57:28.034]  Folks, we're not going to survive if that happens.
[01:57:28.074 --> 01:57:29.336]  We need everybody to be leaders.
[01:57:30.076 --> 01:57:32.199]  I mean, I love it when you get out there on the front lines.
[01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:38.363]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:38.383 --> 01:57:38.903]  Big Brother.
[01:57:39.103 --> 01:57:39.883]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:39.903 --> 01:57:43.085]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:45.306 --> 01:57:48.448]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.431 --> 01:57:58.352]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.372 --> 01:58:01.833]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.193 --> 01:58:06.295]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:10.156 --> 01:58:15.938]  Oh boy, a lot of news coming up in this third hour.
[01:58:15.958 --> 01:58:18.019]  I want to get more into the economy.
[01:58:18.946 --> 01:58:22.471]  Americans are in the greatest level of debt since the depths of the Great Depression.
[01:58:22.511 --> 01:58:23.993]  Get into more on U.N.
[01:58:24.013 --> 01:58:27.698]  taxation and regulation, the Iran-Syria situation, all of it.
[01:58:28.098 --> 01:58:29.360]  And of course your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:29.380 --> 01:58:36.569]  Paul, I'm going to take some calls here in just a moment, but what are some of the other issues we'll cover coming up in the next segment?
[01:58:38.407 --> 01:58:49.136]  Uh, the strange release of one of Osama Bin Laden's most loyal right-hand men, a guy called Tabarek, who the Washington Post reported was released for no apparent reason.
[01:58:49.176 --> 01:58:52.339]  Whenever they accidentally happen to actually catch someone real, they get released.
[01:58:52.799 --> 01:59:07.431]  Yeah, um, and this guy who's all over neocom media, former Iraqi, Saddam's former lieutenant, who is conveniently saying that there was an Osama-Saddam link, and that the WMD was shipped out to Syria before the war.
[01:59:08.146 --> 01:59:11.188]  And I guess after they invade Syria later, they'll have to invade the next country.
[01:59:11.709 --> 01:59:11.969]  Yep.
[01:59:13.530 --> 01:59:17.213]  Just as you keep passing it on to someone until they work their way over to the U.S.
[01:59:18.134 --> 01:59:21.957]  Let's go ahead and go to Eddie in England, then Jeff, Fred, and others.
[01:59:21.977 --> 01:59:22.557]  Go ahead, Eddie.
[01:59:24.619 --> 01:59:24.999]  Hello.
[01:59:25.359 --> 01:59:25.920]  Hi, Eddie.
[01:59:26.640 --> 01:59:27.201]  Hello, Alex.
[01:59:27.681 --> 01:59:35.968]  I'm glad I was speaking to you and Paul, and I wanted to get your input, both of you,
[01:59:37.327 --> 01:59:50.875]  On the parallel between the Patriot Act in America and our Civil Contingencies Bill, which seems to me to be almost exactly the same.
[01:59:50.975 --> 01:59:59.439]  Oh, listen, I mean, they have Head Start for kids to drug them and brainwash them and get CPS involved in the family, and it's called Secure Start in England.
[01:59:59.479 --> 02:00:02.021]  I mean, it's exactly the same stuff, Paul.
[02:00:03.297 --> 02:00:04.818]  Well, yeah, it's like a spider's web.
[02:00:04.858 --> 02:00:08.241]  Same programs at the same time, sometimes even with the same names.
[02:00:08.261 --> 02:00:16.927]  Um, because it's an orchestrated agenda and they don't want to get out of time with each other, um, because they need to plan the next step after that.
[02:00:17.007 --> 02:00:18.688]  So it's all very orchestrated.
[02:00:19.969 --> 02:00:32.538]  The point I was trying to, um, hopefully to get over, and I know you're both writers and I will ever be, but it's the fact that the, um, the confiscation of
[02:00:33.410 --> 02:00:46.437]  property, the ability, this is the Civil Contingencies Bill here in Great Britain, the ability to cut whole sections of the community off and remove them from areas.
[02:00:46.457 --> 02:00:52.981]  It's almost like 1933, Hitler's 1933 Enabling Act.
[02:00:53.081 --> 02:00:54.102]  It's appalling.
[02:00:58.675 --> 02:01:01.236]  Well, look at this story out of Chicago, Illinois.
[02:01:01.316 --> 02:01:05.177]  Daily, cameras will make us safer, the son of a mom boss says.
[02:01:05.578 --> 02:01:16.482]  Mayor Daley on Monday embraced a radical plan to require every licensed store or business in Chicago open more than 12 hours a day to install indoor and outdoor cameras.
[02:01:16.962 --> 02:01:19.803]  Book clubs, bars, everything.
[02:01:20.283 --> 02:01:26.205]  And by the way, in London they're now going to make all of the private cameras be hooked into the grid too.
[02:01:26.285 --> 02:01:27.926]  So see, total control.
[02:01:29.059 --> 02:01:31.421]  Absolutely total control.
[02:01:31.701 --> 02:01:32.682]  It is frightening.
[02:01:33.703 --> 02:01:34.884]  Imagine what they're planning.
[02:01:34.904 --> 02:01:35.505]  Well, we know.
[02:01:35.525 --> 02:01:37.887]  Notice, folks, remember this years from now.
[02:01:37.947 --> 02:01:41.550]  The more control you give up to them, the more terror, the more police state.
[02:01:41.870 --> 02:01:44.052]  And then you criticize having your bank account taken.
[02:01:44.252 --> 02:01:45.714]  You're going to be taken to a FEMA camp.
[02:01:46.114 --> 02:01:48.116]  It'll just be, well, Bill was protesting.
[02:01:48.376 --> 02:01:49.097]  He's gone.
[02:01:49.437 --> 02:01:50.177]  Yes Alex, you've got it right on.
[02:02:18.539 --> 02:02:20.000]  Well, Eddie, it's good to hear from you in England.
[02:02:20.040 --> 02:02:20.400]  Take care.
[02:02:20.420 --> 02:02:25.523]  We'll come back and cover some news that Paul was just mentioning, and we'll go to Jeff and Fred and others.
[02:02:25.543 --> 02:02:26.463]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:26.483 --> 02:02:30.765]  It's just, I mean, I'm not kidding, folks.
[02:02:30.785 --> 02:02:40.691]  They're just systematically crossing every T, dotting every I, lovingly crafting a steel Iron Maiden to slam us in.
[02:02:41.131 --> 02:02:42.612]  And they're saying they're going to do it!
[02:02:46.914 --> 02:02:49.757]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:50.017 --> 02:02:51.579]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.939 --> 02:02:56.604]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.944 --> 02:03:03.691]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:04.011 --> 02:03:05.993]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:06.193 --> 02:03:09.055]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:09.135 --> 02:03:13.799]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.999 --> 02:03:18.402]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.643 --> 02:03:25.868]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:26.129 --> 02:03:28.570]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.
[02:03:28.711 --> 02:03:30.452]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:03:33.953 --> 02:03:38.595]  That's InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139 or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:48.641]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:03:48.962 --> 02:03:51.745]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:52.025 --> 02:03:56.170]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:56.610 --> 02:03:57.431]  So what do you do?
[02:03:57.752 --> 02:04:02.337]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:02.817 --> 02:04:04.900]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:04:05.422 --> 02:04:20.118]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:20.158 --> 02:04:27.226]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:04:27.566 --> 02:04:31.971]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[02:04:32.412 --> 02:04:34.194]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:34.214 --> 02:04:34.434]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:34.514 --> 02:04:35.996]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[02:04:45.615 --> 02:04:50.037]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[02:04:50.317 --> 02:04:53.919]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[02:04:54.059 --> 02:05:02.183]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[02:05:02.443 --> 02:05:08.066]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[02:05:08.366 --> 02:05:13.628]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[02:05:13.888 --> 02:05:15.948]  This is why you need the Filter Mag.
[02:05:16.228 --> 02:05:28.372]  The Filter Mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[02:05:28.612 --> 02:05:33.036]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[02:05:33.256 --> 02:05:34.197]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:05:34.377 --> 02:05:36.018]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[02:05:36.138 --> 02:05:37.940]  That's FilterMag.com.
[02:05:38.180 --> 02:05:39.101]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[02:05:39.141 --> 02:05:43.864]  That's 800-345-8376.
[02:05:46.867 --> 02:05:52.912]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.512 --> 02:05:56.495]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:58.943 --> 02:05:59.423]  We're good to go.
[02:06:17.084 --> 02:06:20.546]  Paul, let me bring up this instant message somebody sent me for you.
[02:06:21.026 --> 02:06:24.408]  Alex, ask Paul Watson about hate laws.
[02:06:24.608 --> 02:06:24.928]  Thanks.
[02:06:24.948 --> 02:06:32.832]  And I guess he's talking about the big protests that are going on in England right now with the police there dutifully registering everyone that is protesting peacefully.
[02:06:32.852 --> 02:06:33.972]  You've just got to do that now.
[02:06:33.992 --> 02:06:40.935]  The secret police society, what the Russians were ashamed of, what their secret police snuck around and did, we just do in the open now.
[02:06:40.955 --> 02:06:41.776]  It's all part of freedom.
[02:06:41.796 --> 02:06:42.856]  Border stays wide open, though.
[02:06:43.156 --> 02:06:44.177]  Your tunnel stays wide open.
[02:06:45.218 --> 02:06:49.086]  Yeah, he wanted to get your take on all that stuff that's going on over there and over here.
[02:06:49.607 --> 02:06:53.375]  I would just add, preemptively, the caveat, or I guess the hors d'oeuvre...
[02:06:54.349 --> 02:07:00.295]  That Google isn't just going to go along with China restricting even jokes or talk of liquor.
[02:07:00.696 --> 02:07:02.017]  I mean, just you name it.
[02:07:02.598 --> 02:07:07.843]  Now it's not thousands, it's hundreds of thousands of mainstream newspapers are now being blocked.
[02:07:08.544 --> 02:07:10.306]  In China, Google is dutifully helping.
[02:07:10.326 --> 02:07:16.873]  They've taken the we don't censor thing off of their mission statement and off of their use policy.
[02:07:17.942 --> 02:07:26.144]  Now Europe wants no criticism of age, produce, you can't even say I like German strawberries better, that's a real case by the way.
[02:07:26.844 --> 02:07:30.825]  Just no discernment, no, you know, I like brunettes.
[02:07:30.905 --> 02:07:32.885]  I mean, just literally, it says it.
[02:07:32.945 --> 02:07:37.046]  I have mainstream British news articles reporting it like it's sane.
[02:07:37.466 --> 02:07:40.607]  Just no free speech basically of any type, Paul.
[02:07:40.787 --> 02:07:41.587]  You want to comment on that?
[02:07:42.787 --> 02:07:46.248]  Well yeah, we hear about raids in Britain.
[02:07:47.176 --> 02:07:57.862]  At least two, three times a month, where just unnamed people are basically swept off the street or from their homes under the guise of hate crimes.
[02:07:58.042 --> 02:08:02.085]  Well, there was a BBC headline a few years ago of hundreds raided an overnight raid.
[02:08:02.605 --> 02:08:05.067]  Most were heard by neighbors to say racial comments.
[02:08:05.527 --> 02:08:07.768]  And they actually bossed down your door and dragged you off.
[02:08:07.828 --> 02:08:08.529]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:08:09.649 --> 02:08:14.152]  Yeah, and as I mentioned earlier, that author in Cambridge, which is just outside London,
[02:08:15.285 --> 02:08:21.212]  Um, writes a book against homosexual adoption, goes on a radio program, states her opposition to it.
[02:08:21.873 --> 02:08:26.278]  An hour later gets a call from the police and she tells them, well, have I broken any laws?
[02:08:26.318 --> 02:08:28.881]  And they say, no, we're just investigating hate crime.
[02:08:30.082 --> 02:08:32.565]  Um, and she says, well, why are you wasting my time?
[02:08:33.467 --> 02:08:44.312]  So I mean, when that's the precedent, when people like Robin Page get up and say that farmers should have the same rights as Muslims and homosexuals... Just saying the word homosexual, they now say it's hate.
[02:08:44.552 --> 02:08:45.953]  You've got to use the word gay.
[02:08:46.293 --> 02:08:46.814]  And that was me.
[02:08:46.854 --> 02:08:48.234]  He was a BBC News reporter.
[02:08:49.395 --> 02:08:49.675]  Right.
[02:08:49.715 --> 02:08:52.356]  So you've even got credible people being castigated for it.
[02:08:53.337 --> 02:08:53.557]  And it's...
[02:08:55.014 --> 02:09:04.901]  Obviously it came out of the birth of PC, that's kind of on the wayside now, but it's shifted into higher gradients of tyranny whereby hate speech can be defined as anything.
[02:09:04.921 --> 02:09:08.364]  This is a total excuse to go around arresting people!
[02:09:08.384 --> 02:09:12.767]  I mean, it's just like everybody who goes in protest now gets videotaped and registered.
[02:09:13.908 --> 02:09:22.655]  If any kind of activism whatsoever or any kind of public speech is dangerous to the state in their eyes, so is
[02:09:23.180 --> 02:09:24.621]  Therefore, an arrestable offense.
[02:09:44.602 --> 02:09:56.994]  Yeah, it's all about lowering our standard to a second, third world standard and then obviously you've got a disenfranchised population, they're easier to submerge under the tyranny, the boot of tyranny.
[02:09:59.638 --> 02:10:01.018]  I mean, we're not kidding about this.
[02:10:01.058 --> 02:10:03.919]  This is a horrible slave system they're building.
[02:10:03.959 --> 02:10:06.240]  You know, the globalists that run the planet are ruthless.
[02:10:06.260 --> 02:10:07.080]  They're barbarous.
[02:10:07.320 --> 02:10:08.560]  That's why they're in control.
[02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:12.141]  And don't be so naive and think that they're not going to take what you've got.
[02:10:12.521 --> 02:10:15.902]  You can't just sit there like a bunch of jellyfish and be free, folks.
[02:10:16.142 --> 02:10:18.383]  They're going to come and they're going to take advantage of you!
[02:10:21.604 --> 02:10:26.885]  We've got this freedom because our forefathers weren't slaves and weren't going to put up with being pushed around.
[02:10:28.426 --> 02:10:30.247]  Oh, that just makes me sick.
[02:10:30.808 --> 02:10:39.534]  Paul, let's get into the, uh, not just the new fake bin Laden tapes to pile on top of the others, but there's been a lot of other propaganda going on.
[02:10:39.574 --> 02:10:40.055]  Tell us about it.
[02:10:40.075 --> 02:10:51.423]  Yeah, there's a guy who's a former lieutenant of Saddam Hussein who's been all over the neocon, mouthpiece media, Sean Hannity, Fox News, etc.
[02:10:52.574 --> 02:11:03.427]  Saying that there was a supposed rendezvous between Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein, where he came and saw the Iraqi Air Force Headquarters in 1984 and 85.
[02:11:06.047 --> 02:11:20.731]  The problem with that is, if you want to go and accuse anybody of meeting with Saddam Hussein in the mid-80s, then Donald Brumstead would be a prime suspect, as he was selling the chemical biological weapons to him in December 1984.
[02:11:20.951 --> 02:11:29.574]  Well, bin Laden was admittedly a CIA commander, commanding Mujahideen forces at that very time.
[02:11:29.974 --> 02:11:30.634]  This is public!
[02:11:31.427 --> 02:11:34.649]  And so even if you believe that, it means nothing.
[02:11:35.009 --> 02:11:36.710]  Saddam was our ally at that time.
[02:11:37.450 --> 02:11:37.730]  Right.
[02:11:38.010 --> 02:11:46.094]  Colin Powell was, as Reagan's National Security Advisor, was basically running Iraqi battlefield intelligence in the war with Iran.
[02:11:46.877 --> 02:11:58.900]  So how you can talk about Bin Laden meeting with Saddam Hussein in the mid-eighties and that being terrible, again it's a double thing, when former and current US government officials were doing exactly the same thing.
[02:11:59.500 --> 02:12:02.220]  How could you have such a disconnect?
[02:12:02.420 --> 02:12:05.201]  I mean, they were both client agents of the US government.
[02:12:05.981 --> 02:12:13.603]  So how can you have a disconnect where it's bad when Bin Laden meets Hussein in the mid-eighties but when Donald Rumsfeld does it, it's fine?
[02:12:15.144 --> 02:12:16.668]  Wim Ben-Waden is an own U.S.
[02:12:16.769 --> 02:12:17.050]  asset.
[02:12:18.419 --> 02:12:21.001]  Yeah, as was Saddam Hussein at that point.
[02:12:21.401 --> 02:12:42.935]  If you even believe that, he's also saying that they shipped the WMDs into Syria when the UN inspectors, again, they complied, look what happened to them, had been all over that country and the UN had destroyed those weapons, predominantly sold to Saddam by Russia and the US, when the UN had already destroyed them in 1991 and 92.
[02:12:43.575 --> 02:12:47.638]  They'd already been there, destroyed them, these are official certified sites.
[02:12:48.559 --> 02:12:55.886]  Right, and Iraq produced a dossier detailing what happened to all their weapons of mass destruction sold to them by the U.S.
[02:12:55.966 --> 02:12:56.387]  and U.K.
[02:12:56.427 --> 02:12:56.787]  governments.
[02:12:56.827 --> 02:13:00.250]  Special forces go in and raid it and take out thousands of pages.
[02:13:00.270 --> 02:13:03.093]  Take out two-thirds of the document, and then the U.S.
[02:13:03.133 --> 02:13:05.155]  government comes back and says it's incomplete.
[02:13:05.215 --> 02:13:10.380]  Well, of course it's incomplete, because they removed two-thirds of it after the Iraqis gave it to them.
[02:13:11.065 --> 02:13:15.248]  And then France did get a full copy and guess what was in it?
[02:13:15.368 --> 02:13:19.350]  All the stuff that was taken out was Rumsfeld and Chaney and all them by name.
[02:13:20.591 --> 02:13:22.512]  Yeah, and it was all the companies that had armed them.
[02:13:23.012 --> 02:13:25.613]  That got later published in German newspapers as well.
[02:13:25.834 --> 02:13:35.519]  By the way, picture a UN building in Baghdad and US Special Forces run in with machine guns and grab all the documents that the US had ordered they give them.
[02:13:36.560 --> 02:13:36.740]  Right.
[02:13:38.251 --> 02:13:39.712]  I mean, it's just lawlessness.
[02:13:39.772 --> 02:13:42.033]  It's just lawless criminality.
[02:13:43.213 --> 02:13:46.435]  And then on the subject of clients of the U.S.
[02:13:46.475 --> 02:13:58.081]  government, you've got this guy Tabarek, who was basically Bin Laden's most loyal lieutenant during the Tora Bora battle, December 2001.
[02:13:58.941 --> 02:14:04.304]  He takes Bin Laden, if you believe that Bin Laden was still alive, he takes Bin Laden's satellite phone
[02:14:05.084 --> 02:14:12.568]  Um, and heads towards the Pakistani border while making calls on it, therefore diverting attention from them tracking down Bin Laden.
[02:14:13.228 --> 02:14:22.533]  Um, gets arrested and now Washington Post reported on Monday that he's been released and there's no explanation behind it whatsoever.
[02:14:22.553 --> 02:14:24.994]  He's been released from Guantanamo Bay and he's free.
[02:14:26.615 --> 02:14:28.216]  Whereas the, uh, 70 to 90% of Iraqis
[02:14:30.636 --> 02:14:41.365]  who were taken to prison camps as suspected insurgents, were arrested for the crime of not showing their papers at checkpoints, 70 to 90 percent.
[02:14:43.507 --> 02:14:53.535]  The Pakistani gangsters who admitted rounding up innocent people in street sweeps and selling them to the US government as terrorists for anything up to $25,000, they're still at Guantanamo Bay,
[02:14:57.200 --> 02:15:01.662]  Um, only nine alleged terrorists have been brought to trial by the U.S.
[02:15:01.682 --> 02:15:08.565]  government and none have been convicted and yet, um, Osama Bin Laden's most loyal commander is set free.
[02:15:10.265 --> 02:15:11.486]  How do we explain that one?
[02:15:12.466 --> 02:15:14.947]  And it happens over and over and over and over again.
[02:15:15.968 --> 02:15:23.531]  Yeah, Iron Man Faris, uh, he was supposedly going to blow up the Brooklyn Bridge using a blowtorch.
[02:15:24.700 --> 02:15:27.823]  He turns out to be a FBI informant.
[02:15:27.903 --> 02:15:32.287]  Well, time and time again, there were so many cases where they busted number two, they busted number three.
[02:15:32.327 --> 02:15:33.367]  It's always number two and number three.
[02:15:33.387 --> 02:15:37.591]  And in Pakistan, and then you hear a month later, he was actually covertly released.
[02:15:37.611 --> 02:15:42.175]  He was really deep CIA cover, and they staged the arrest to simply keep him safe.
[02:15:42.865 --> 02:15:44.227]  I mean, it should never end!
[02:15:44.387 --> 02:15:52.415]  Which is why they ran into a problem at the Moussaoui trial, because he kept trying to call so-called al-Qaeda individuals who the U.S.
[02:15:52.455 --> 02:15:58.682]  government arrested, but they'd either faked the arrest or already released them, so the U.S.
[02:15:58.702 --> 02:16:02.266]  government disallowed them being called to the trial.
[02:16:03.360 --> 02:16:12.908]  And now they've killed three of Saddam's lawyers, one judge quit saying it is a staged trial, and then now they've got a new judge who won't even let Saddam put on a case if it even is Saddam.
[02:16:12.928 --> 02:16:14.589]  We don't even know what to trust anymore.
[02:16:14.630 --> 02:16:15.350]  Paul, we're out of time.
[02:16:15.370 --> 02:16:18.052]  I'm going to come back and take calls and cover a bunch of other news.
[02:16:18.152 --> 02:16:28.201]  All the callers that are holding, I'm going to get to you immediately on the other side, but I want to thank you for the great work you're doing over at PrisonPlanet.com, Paul, and of course your brother Steve, all of us working together.
[02:16:28.281 --> 02:16:29.082]  I would add that
[02:16:30.183 --> 02:16:36.266]  The good news is, the Pan-American Union had a huge failure last year.
[02:16:36.286 --> 02:16:43.969]  A bunch of European countries rejected EU expansion, and the world taxation is in trouble.
[02:16:44.389 --> 02:16:51.913]  So the globalists are trying to move forward with their plan, but they are running into major obstacles and people are starting to get wise, Paul.
[02:16:53.075 --> 02:16:55.316]  Well, yeah, they've had to shift tactics.
[02:16:55.896 --> 02:16:58.437]  They've stopped legislating their way to world government.
[02:16:58.477 --> 02:17:00.478]  Now they're trying to bomb their way to world government.
[02:17:00.578 --> 02:17:05.180]  So we've remained steadfast in our opposition, but they're the ones that have had to change tactics.
[02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:07.101]  So that's the benchmark of our success.
[02:17:08.610 --> 02:17:11.751]  And when they carry out a bombing in London, it's backfiring.
[02:17:11.971 --> 02:17:14.371]  The public now in major polls think there's something suspicious.
[02:17:14.851 --> 02:17:17.152]  People instantly in Madrid knew it was the government.
[02:17:17.532 --> 02:17:22.673]  In Spain, people are waking up here, major polls, the majority of Americans believe the government may have been involved.
[02:17:23.193 --> 02:17:24.074]  I mean, think about that.
[02:17:24.114 --> 02:17:29.435]  We've gone from nobody believing me, when I announced on 9-11 it was an inside job, I announced before 9-11,
[02:17:29.855 --> 02:17:33.278]  By the way, he said they'd hit World Trade Centers and blame it on their asset, Bin Laden.
[02:17:33.679 --> 02:17:34.740]  So, so, listen!
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.623]  To all the globalists listening, we're coming for you!
[02:17:37.663 --> 02:17:38.924]  You think you're gonna kill us?
[02:17:38.944 --> 02:17:39.965]  You think we're your slaves?
[02:17:40.225 --> 02:17:41.026]  Got another thing coming.
[02:17:41.286 --> 02:17:42.227]  Paul, thanks for joining us.
[02:17:42.247 --> 02:17:43.388]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:46.147 --> 02:17:50.149]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America today.
[02:17:50.569 --> 02:17:54.050]  In 25% of the cases, the first sign is sudden death.
[02:17:54.491 --> 02:17:57.712]  Cardivite has been helping people live as long as God intended us.
[02:17:58.132 --> 02:18:02.694]  Made from seven herbs, cardivite is the purest form of oral chelation available today.
[02:18:02.714 --> 02:18:04.695]  Here's what one person has to say.
[02:18:05.015 --> 02:18:08.697]  I was feeling chest pain from time to time, shortness of breath.
[02:18:08.838 --> 02:18:12.700]  I don't have the tightness on my chest, and I don't have that shortness of breath no more.
[02:18:12.900 --> 02:18:14.101]  I tried all kinds of junk.
[02:18:14.301 --> 02:18:14.801]  It didn't do.
[02:18:14.901 --> 02:18:16.923]  The only thing that worked was your Cardivite.
[02:18:17.283 --> 02:18:19.625]  If you believe Cardivite was made for you, call 1-877-928-8822.

[02:18:47.719 --> 02:18:48.900]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:49.301 --> 02:18:54.786]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:18:55.367 --> 02:18:55.867]  That's right.
[02:18:56.168 --> 02:18:58.470]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:18:59.872 --> 02:19:05.938]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:19:06.491 --> 02:19:14.196]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:19:14.637 --> 02:19:19.500]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:19:20.120 --> 02:19:22.522]  If you'd like to take a look at gold pre-retirement,

[02:22:18.100 --> 02:22:25.964]  And I think really the most important one at this point in time would be the police state video, the martial law police state videos.
[02:22:26.364 --> 02:22:28.665]  I think those are probably the most important because
[02:22:29.578 --> 02:22:36.300]  We are in a police state right now, Alex, and the censorship in this country has gotten completely out of control.
[02:22:36.320 --> 02:22:43.342]  And basically, well, for instance, I just filed a multi-million dollar lawsuit yesterday in the U.S.
[02:22:43.362 --> 02:22:49.904]  District Court in Denver, and of course it hasn't been assigned a case number yet, and it's going to take a week or so to process the complaint.
[02:22:50.464 --> 02:22:53.685]  And I've got a copy of it on my website, but they deleted
[02:22:54.249 --> 02:23:05.434]  Part of the information off of my website, of course the complaint that's on my website is minus several statements and factual allegations versus the complaint.
[02:23:05.594 --> 02:23:06.614]  Well I'm really confused.
[02:23:06.874 --> 02:23:09.035]  How did the government delete something off your website?
[02:23:09.275 --> 02:23:12.377]  Well I guess they must have hacked into it because it's missing off my website.
[02:23:12.437 --> 02:23:12.937]  It's gone!
[02:23:13.990 --> 02:23:16.332]  Well, I mean, that could have been how you uploaded it or something.
[02:23:16.753 --> 02:23:21.756]  Well, no, it's completely... I mean, stuff like that does happen, but I mean, we can't think everything's the government.
[02:23:21.957 --> 02:23:39.890]  Well, in any event, it's missing off my website, and I wanted to point out, for instance, like last night, I called a lot of congressmen and senators, and the censorship, I wanted to mention a couple of important factors, and the 24-hour switchboard to the congressional, to the senators and congressmen, is open 24 hours,
[02:23:41.284 --> 02:23:42.925]  And, you know, you can leave them a message.
[02:23:43.066 --> 02:23:43.306]  Yes.
[02:23:43.686 --> 02:23:52.213]  And when I called in, instead of transferring me to the senator or congressman that I requested, they transferred me to the Capitol Police!
[02:23:52.933 --> 02:23:56.076]  And I went around with the Capitol Police about six times last night.
[02:23:56.536 --> 02:24:00.039]  And I'm sure, this is complete censorship.
[02:24:00.339 --> 02:24:05.403]  They're trying to block information that I'm trying to provide to Congressman Ron Paul, to John Dingell,
[02:24:06.061 --> 02:24:12.767]  To John Kerry and to other congressmen and representatives, and this is completely, that's why they have a 24-hour switchboard.
[02:24:13.087 --> 02:24:14.508]  That's why they have voicemails.
[02:24:14.828 --> 02:24:16.250]  That's why they have answering machines.
[02:24:16.330 --> 02:24:20.553]  No, I know, but in the Patriot Act they claim trying to influence the government is a terrorist act.
[02:24:20.593 --> 02:24:21.334]  Thanks for the call.
[02:24:21.954 --> 02:24:26.018]  Look, most of the censorship is automated.
[02:24:27.059 --> 02:24:29.020]  It's just most libraries in the U.S.
[02:24:29.080 --> 02:24:33.384]  and most colleges, you cannot get to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:24:34.221 --> 02:24:39.446]  Because we post legislation, and we post documents, and we post the facts, and it scares the daylights out of the government.
[02:24:39.706 --> 02:24:43.229]  You know, we'll post where Davos Forum openly calls for world government.
[02:24:43.589 --> 02:24:44.870]  Wow, we put a link to them.
[02:24:44.970 --> 02:24:45.851]  Boy, that's evil.
[02:24:45.891 --> 02:24:48.414]  Man, that's radical stuff, that Alex Jones.
[02:24:49.494 --> 02:24:53.298]  That's the kind of things that we are engaging in on a daily basis.
[02:24:54.679 --> 02:24:55.799]  But it's like MySpace.
[02:24:56.060 --> 02:24:57.220]  You get 38 million members.
[02:24:57.280 --> 02:24:58.180]  It's real popular.
[02:24:59.101 --> 02:25:00.441]  Rupert Murdoch buys it.
[02:25:00.801 --> 02:25:09.004]  And now anything criticizing him or anything that talks about their competition, it just won't let you post those words or those sentences or those names.
[02:25:09.764 --> 02:25:10.965]  Then it's going to get worse and worse.
[02:25:11.025 --> 02:25:16.046]  Now Google's going, well, we're doing it in China, and they've changed their agreement even for the U.S.
[02:25:16.507 --> 02:25:20.788]  They're not saying they're going to censor in the U.S., but they're starting.
[02:25:20.828 --> 02:25:23.569]  So it can all be done selectively.
[02:25:24.366 --> 02:25:26.047]  And it's so un-American!
[02:25:26.067 --> 02:25:28.208]  They're just doing all this out in the open!
[02:25:29.028 --> 02:25:31.029]  Let's go ahead and talk to Fred.
[02:25:31.049 --> 02:25:33.430]  Fred, where are you calling us from?
[02:25:33.811 --> 02:25:34.271]  Kansas.
[02:25:34.491 --> 02:25:34.871]  Welcome.
[02:25:35.131 --> 02:25:35.692]  Yes, thank you.
[02:25:36.072 --> 02:25:42.215]  I wanted to let you know about a postcard I received from my insurance company, which is Farmers Insurance.
[02:25:42.935 --> 02:25:48.258]  Anyhow, the homeowner's policy is called Help Point Insurance.
[02:25:48.598 --> 02:25:53.100]  And actually, it's H-E-L-P-P-O-I-N-T, but it could be Help Point.
[02:25:54.860 --> 02:26:04.524]  Because on the picture on the front of the card there is a married couple standing in front of their house and it's partially burned down.
[02:26:05.404 --> 02:26:17.829]  Help is coming in the form of black ninja clad foreign troops repelling from British helicopters onto their rooftop and in the background there's British Harrier jets.
[02:26:19.318 --> 02:26:22.040]  And that's what is on the front of this postcard.
[02:26:22.340 --> 02:26:23.541]  Well, you've got to mail it to me.
[02:26:23.681 --> 02:26:24.241]  Yeah, sure.
[02:26:24.481 --> 02:26:24.761]  I will.
[02:26:25.002 --> 02:26:26.663]  I mean, it sounds like, well, I appreciate that.
[02:26:26.703 --> 02:26:27.823]  It sounds like par for the course.
[02:26:27.863 --> 02:26:33.067]  Listen, we didn't talk about it a lot, but you know, Paul lives right there in England, and it's in the BBC.
[02:26:33.147 --> 02:26:34.067]  It's in the London Telegraph.
[02:26:34.127 --> 02:26:36.429]  It says, foreign German troops.
[02:26:36.989 --> 02:26:39.550]  Are going to be there for the World Cup searching British citizens.
[02:26:39.750 --> 02:26:41.551]  Now there's no need for foreign troops.
[02:26:41.811 --> 02:26:51.454]  They're setting the precedent because foreign troops statistically and historically, history has shown, will oppress populations.
[02:26:51.494 --> 02:26:53.595]  But your own troops tend to not want to do it.
[02:26:54.275 --> 02:26:56.316]  So, I mean, it's actually happening!
[02:26:57.543 --> 02:27:09.532]  And if memory serves me, Jack McClain, he had that Vampire Killer 2000, and I used to have a copy of that, and there was a map on there showing the regional troops.
[02:27:10.032 --> 02:27:11.393]  Yeah, that's an official U.S.
[02:27:11.433 --> 02:27:12.054]  government map.
[02:27:12.094 --> 02:27:13.755]  I have an actual copy of it.
[02:27:14.075 --> 02:27:22.181]  Czechoslovakian in Mississippi, Louisiana, Chinese on the West Coast, Russians in Michigan and other areas, Dutch, British.
[02:27:23.442 --> 02:27:24.063]  Isn't it nice?
[02:27:25.715 --> 02:27:26.315]  Isn't it nice?
[02:27:26.335 --> 02:27:27.796]  And that's a map from the 60s.
[02:27:28.516 --> 02:27:30.877]  And everywhere it says the troops will be, there's already troops.
[02:27:31.337 --> 02:27:32.557]  But they're here to help.
[02:27:32.597 --> 02:27:34.097]  They're here to fight terrorists.
[02:27:36.158 --> 02:27:37.078]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.558 --> 02:27:39.159]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.079 --> 02:27:42.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.987 --> 02:27:47.109]  You don't love me anymore?
[02:27:47.429 --> 02:27:49.212]  You used to take such good care of me.
[02:27:49.232 --> 02:27:50.714]  Is that my car talking to me?
[02:27:50.875 --> 02:27:51.155]  Yes.
[02:27:51.456 --> 02:27:52.317]  You neglect me.
[02:27:52.477 --> 02:27:54.460]  Change my oil late most of the time.
[02:27:56.303 --> 02:27:57.305]  Use the cheapest gas.
[02:27:57.645 --> 02:27:58.507]  I'm getting sick.
[02:27:58.827 --> 02:28:01.011]  One of these days, I'm just gonna give up.
[02:28:02.051 --> 02:28:02.531]  Wait a minute.
[02:28:02.631 --> 02:28:04.232]  I've got three more years of payments on you.
[02:28:04.472 --> 02:28:13.055]  If you want me to last forever, you need to add protected engine treatment, protected transmission treatment, and especially protected complete fuel system treatment.
[02:28:13.495 --> 02:28:18.977]  Protected unique synthetic fortifiers treat the metal and the oil to reduce friction like no other.
[02:28:19.177 --> 02:28:21.578]  Okay, I'll add some protecta, but you'll have to perform.
[02:28:21.738 --> 02:28:26.403]  How about faster acceleration, more horsepower, longer lasting.
[02:28:26.623 --> 02:28:28.285]  I'll always be there for you.
[02:28:28.465 --> 02:28:31.788]  So if you want more, treat it right with Protecta by SFR.
[02:28:31.968 --> 02:28:35.812]  For a special offer of free shipping, go to www.sfrcorp.com or call 888-USE-SFR1.
[02:28:35.832 --> 02:28:37.734]  That's www.sfrcorp.com or call 888-USE-SFR1.
[02:28:46.573 --> 02:28:48.214]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:48.334 --> 02:28:52.456]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:52.576 --> 02:28:55.438]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:55.538 --> 02:29:02.242]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:29:02.422 --> 02:29:05.443]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:05.643 --> 02:29:08.025]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:08.165 --> 02:29:10.486]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria,
[02:29:10.486 --> 02:29:11.026]  We're good to go!
[02:29:37.773 --> 02:29:42.699]  For thousands of years, the secret of vitality, strength, virility, and endurance was kept by the ancient Incas, until now.
[02:29:56.093 --> 02:30:10.663]  Maka, a tuberous plant that only grows in one area of the Andes Mountains, is a functional food and it contains no cholesterol, is rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber, protein, five natural sterols, and seven of the nine essential amino acids.
[02:30:11.324 --> 02:30:17.588]  The folks at Vitamere have now made Maka available in powder form so that you can experience its nutritional benefits.
[02:30:18.249 --> 02:30:19.530]  Call 877-817-9829 to order Maka today.
[02:30:23.442 --> 02:30:28.907]  Maka also contains tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, and fatty acids not found in other foods.
[02:30:29.508 --> 02:30:32.611]  Try Maka, and you'll know the secret of the ancient Incas.
[02:30:33.031 --> 02:30:33.291]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:30:33.331 --> 02:30:34.713]  That's 877-817-9829, and order your Maka today.
[02:30:34.753 --> 02:30:35.073]  Maka.
[02:30:35.313 --> 02:30:37.055]  Now, you'll know the secret.
[02:30:50.783 --> 02:30:52.684]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:30:53.165 --> 02:30:55.986]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:10.735 --> 02:31:13.477]  I'm here live, folks, Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:31:13.697 --> 02:31:14.517]  until 2 p.m.
[02:31:14.997 --> 02:31:17.439]  Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight.
[02:31:18.988 --> 02:31:30.634]  And a lot of people for the first time are driving along in their cars today, or maybe they're at home painting their house, or wherever you're at, or you've got a new job at a business that happens to play the radio show, they're in the shop or whatever.
[02:31:31.155 --> 02:31:33.896]  You're like, how do they let a guy get on the air and talk like that?
[02:31:34.176 --> 02:31:34.937]  What's that guy?
[02:31:35.397 --> 02:31:36.998]  That's crazy talk!
[02:31:37.018 --> 02:31:38.699]  They're going to take over and do all this?
[02:31:39.582 --> 02:31:51.907]  Well, listen, the reason I'm able to have all these affiliates, the reason I'm able to reach out to the people, and the reason that I'm, quote, allowed to be on the air is because a lot of people have done what you're doing right now.
[02:31:52.507 --> 02:31:55.329]  They've heard the show, they don't believe it, and then they take my challenge.
[02:31:55.349 --> 02:31:56.009]  They go check it out.
[02:31:56.738 --> 02:31:59.559]  And believe me, unfortunately, I wish I was lying.
[02:31:59.619 --> 02:32:00.479]  I wish it wasn't true.
[02:32:00.759 --> 02:32:02.020]  I mean, I'm freaked out about this.
[02:32:02.080 --> 02:32:03.940]  I sit around my wife going, what are we going to do?
[02:32:03.960 --> 02:32:06.041]  I mean, it's worse than we thought.
[02:32:06.081 --> 02:32:08.262]  I mean, it's really happening.
[02:32:08.442 --> 02:32:09.422]  But that's just history.
[02:32:09.902 --> 02:32:12.983]  It always shocks the generation that has to go through it.
[02:32:13.403 --> 02:32:14.183]  Really bad tyranny.
[02:32:14.203 --> 02:32:15.484]  They're always, I can't believe it.
[02:32:15.524 --> 02:32:16.644]  Nobody thought it would happen.
[02:32:17.024 --> 02:32:19.285]  But you look at modern history and then ancient history,
[02:32:20.266 --> 02:32:21.648]  Freedom is incredibly rare!
[02:32:21.708 --> 02:32:23.390]  Freedom is almost unknown!
[02:32:23.991 --> 02:32:33.785]  Slavery, and lies, and subterfuge, and conspiracies, and wars, and assassinations, and just brutality!
[02:32:34.697 --> 02:32:36.338]  Romans, you know, in 70 A.D.
[02:32:36.378 --> 02:32:49.186]  going in and killing a million point two Jews in Israel, or, you know, the Japanese would take over a town and kill everybody in it, or what the Babylonians would do, or what the Nazis did.
[02:32:49.246 --> 02:32:50.467]  I mean, this is what happens.
[02:32:51.768 --> 02:32:57.352]  Almost every Latin American country, well, not almost everyone, has had death squads roaming around killing villages.
[02:32:57.372 --> 02:33:01.554]  I mean, it's just, crooks get in control, bad stuff happens.
[02:33:01.574 --> 02:33:03.736]  That's why we got a Second Amendment, going, hey,
[02:33:04.548 --> 02:33:09.791]  This is to defend against common street thugs, but more importantly, against government tyranny.
[02:33:10.451 --> 02:33:12.993]  The Revolutionary War started when they came to take the guns.
[02:33:13.053 --> 02:33:19.296]  It started in Texas, with Mexico, with a dictator that Mexicans didn't like, by the way, when he came to take the guns.
[02:33:19.716 --> 02:33:21.777]  It's how it always starts with the free people.
[02:33:22.277 --> 02:33:30.462]  And believe me, I mean, I've had Bob Barone on this radio show just a month ago, and he said Bush is more anti-gun than Clinton was.
[02:33:32.620 --> 02:33:39.501]  And I've always... I sit there and tell liberals out there, I mean, if you really support what the Democratic Party has always been pushing for, then you should love George Bush!
[02:33:40.201 --> 02:33:47.943]  Open borders, gun control, huge government agencies, pork barrel... No, but you hate him because he's a Republican.
[02:33:48.003 --> 02:33:52.123]  You can now really see what your Democratic Party is through George Bush.
[02:33:52.784 --> 02:33:55.024]  It's just that they've bought off both parties.
[02:33:55.104 --> 02:33:56.324]  It's the elite's party.
[02:33:56.784 --> 02:34:01.165]  And you better get back to a populist base of anti-war, pro-sovereignty,
[02:34:02.463 --> 02:34:03.224]  Pro-defense.
[02:34:03.284 --> 02:34:05.846]  I mean, they really are training troops to come and take your family.
[02:34:06.087 --> 02:34:07.828]  They really are building the FEMA Centers.
[02:34:07.868 --> 02:34:08.949]  In fact, I want to get to that article.
[02:34:09.009 --> 02:34:09.950]  It's here in the Stackabout.
[02:34:10.991 --> 02:34:12.793]  Now Halliburton's going to be involved in all that.
[02:34:13.253 --> 02:34:15.396]  I mean, this is serious business.
[02:34:16.216 --> 02:34:17.117]  This isn't a drill.
[02:34:17.157 --> 02:34:17.998]  This isn't a joke.
[02:34:18.278 --> 02:34:19.199]  This isn't a game.
[02:34:19.540 --> 02:34:21.441]  Believe me, this is what I do.
[02:34:21.461 --> 02:34:24.084]  I was up until 2 in the morning last night.
[02:34:24.685 --> 02:34:44.756]  I was on another radio show until midnight, then I worked some more at the office, and then I went home and did some work, and then I was up at 7 this morning, and I was getting ready for this broadcast, and I'm in here working on films during the break, and just fighting, and constantly looking at every angle I can engage the enemy at, and I know I don't do the best job, but man, believe me, we're experts on this!
[02:34:44.836 --> 02:34:45.336]  We know!
[02:34:46.177 --> 02:34:48.398]  We know what's going on, and it is not pretty!
[02:34:49.193 --> 02:34:50.894]  Believe me, I've looked at it from every angle.
[02:34:50.954 --> 02:34:52.755]  I've tried to disprove it to myself.
[02:34:52.955 --> 02:34:55.117]  I don't want this to be true.
[02:34:55.477 --> 02:34:56.958]  I don't want it, but it is!
[02:35:00.880 --> 02:35:02.121]  It is, my friends.
[02:35:02.721 --> 02:35:03.782]  Let's take some calls here.
[02:35:04.262 --> 02:35:09.045]  Let's go ahead and talk to James in Arkansas.
[02:35:09.105 --> 02:35:10.446]  James, you're on the air.
[02:35:11.166 --> 02:35:11.826]  Yes, Alex.
[02:35:12.027 --> 02:35:15.849]  I saw you on George Norian and I thought you did a really good job.
[02:35:16.897 --> 02:35:17.977]  Well, thank you.
[02:35:17.997 --> 02:35:19.077]  You heard me on his radio show?
[02:35:19.518 --> 02:35:20.098]  Uh, yeah.
[02:35:20.538 --> 02:35:21.498]  Well, I hope I did a good job.
[02:35:21.538 --> 02:35:21.858]  Thank you.
[02:35:22.298 --> 02:35:31.300]  Anyway, the reason I was calling, you know, you were mentioning that 135-foot owl in the Bulimian Grove.
[02:35:31.660 --> 02:35:35.861]  Yeah, it's a 45-foot pagan idol that George Bush worships, yes.
[02:35:35.881 --> 02:35:36.661]  Okay, excuse me.
[02:35:36.681 --> 02:35:37.981]  I have photos of him in front of it.
[02:35:38.761 --> 02:35:46.003]  Anyway, what it was, I don't know if you know this, but, I mean, of course you know it's the symbol of the Illuminati or whatever, but... Moloch.
[02:35:46.710 --> 02:35:53.813]  Anyway, on the old $5 bill, on the front of it, you know, on the border it had leaves.
[02:35:54.553 --> 02:35:56.454]  If you look in those leaves, there's an owl in there.
[02:35:56.634 --> 02:35:57.075]  No, I know.
[02:35:57.535 --> 02:35:58.895]  It's also on the $1 bill.
[02:35:59.216 --> 02:35:59.596]  Oh, really?
[02:35:59.616 --> 02:36:00.756]  I didn't know that.
[02:36:01.797 --> 02:36:04.498]  Anyway, I just, and you know, 45, 4 and 5 is 9.
[02:36:04.758 --> 02:36:09.360]  That's one of their big, that's their number of revolution, or whatever they call it.
[02:36:11.087 --> 02:36:15.770]  Well, I mean, listen, I just covered the news, and skull and bones is real, that's admitted.
[02:36:16.331 --> 02:36:20.634]  And they do satanic oaths, but Peter Jennings, before he died, said it was just for fun when he covered it.
[02:36:21.134 --> 02:36:26.738]  And I'll never forget, he showed rituals where they shot outside of mock murders, and he said, oh, it's just fun.
[02:36:27.098 --> 02:36:30.901]  Well, as old men, they go to Bohemian Grove, and believe me, they take it deadly serious.
[02:36:32.230 --> 02:36:36.794]  Anyway, I just want you to know I really enjoy listening to you, and I'll continue to do so.
[02:36:37.434 --> 02:36:40.217]  Well, I appreciate you tuning in, and please spread the word about the broadcast.
[02:36:40.297 --> 02:36:45.081]  I mean, regardless of how you listen, AM, FM, shortwave, internet, satellite.
[02:36:45.101 --> 02:36:46.222]  Thank you so much, James.
[02:36:46.942 --> 02:36:48.263]  Who's up next in Chicago?
[02:36:49.684 --> 02:36:52.186]  Vandy in Chicago!
[02:36:52.587 --> 02:36:53.387]  Welcome, Vandy.
[02:36:53.948 --> 02:36:55.309]  Alex, first time caller.
[02:36:55.349 --> 02:36:58.392]  Man, it is great to talk to you for once.
[02:36:58.412 --> 02:36:59.352]  It's good to have you on with us.
[02:36:59.372 --> 02:37:00.033]  What's on your mind?
[02:37:00.743 --> 02:37:01.964]  Uh, well, one thing.
[02:37:02.885 --> 02:37:05.988]  You actually brought my family and I together, especially my grandfather.
[02:37:06.509 --> 02:37:10.212]  He used to talk about the bloodlines when I was a kid and I just blew it off.
[02:37:10.933 --> 02:37:15.177]  The first time I heard you was on the Man Cow Show and then a bolt of lightning hit me.
[02:37:15.537 --> 02:37:16.298]  The guy is right.
[02:37:17.239 --> 02:37:18.640]  He's been following your work ever since.
[02:37:20.859 --> 02:37:24.141]  Well, Mantel, he's got the number one radio show in the morning in Chicago.
[02:37:24.181 --> 02:37:28.024]  It's now syndicated, and I go on there every few weeks whenever he asks me to come on.
[02:37:30.266 --> 02:37:34.829]  So I was saying close to the same thing your grandfather said, and I guess what?
[02:37:35.109 --> 02:37:41.874]  You'd seen your family, let me guess, make fun of him, and then you heard somebody else saying the exact same thing, and it was like, wow, I've heard this before?
[02:37:41.894 --> 02:37:45.257]  Yes, it was always the old-timers would talk about it.
[02:37:45.977 --> 02:37:49.540]  I have a degree in history, and when you read a history book,
[02:37:55.229 --> 02:37:57.610]  Well, that's certainly the truth.
[02:37:57.690 --> 02:37:59.291]  Or it's lying by omission.
[02:37:59.311 --> 02:38:02.432]  They'll tell the truth about a bunch of stuff, but then leave out all the key parts.
[02:38:03.052 --> 02:38:03.272]  Yep.
[02:38:03.633 --> 02:38:04.333]  One other thing.
[02:38:05.033 --> 02:38:09.075]  Have you heard any chatter about something going down at the Pucca Bowl this weekend?
[02:38:09.824 --> 02:38:14.728]  Well, the Feds put that out every year, and they like to create a sense of realism.
[02:38:14.748 --> 02:38:21.132]  They issue fake terror alerts, and they say it may happen, and they have drills, and it's all about every big event.
[02:38:21.412 --> 02:38:24.755]  World Cup, Super Bowl, Kentucky Derby, gotta have U.S.
[02:38:24.835 --> 02:38:31.759]  Army, gotta have biometrics, even the promos to the Super Bowl have the players being retina scanned back at the Super Bowl after 9-11.
[02:38:32.940 --> 02:38:34.521]  And that's in my film Road to Tyranny.
[02:38:34.821 --> 02:38:42.786]  It's all to bathe you, to baste you, to soak you in evil, to just acclimate you to being a slave.
[02:38:43.386 --> 02:38:51.250]  And yes, they've been hyping the daylights out of a nuke going off, or an A-bomb, or a dirty bomb going off in Detroit.
[02:38:51.530 --> 02:38:52.551]  And it does two things.
[02:38:52.591 --> 02:38:54.512]  The government puts it out in fear mongers.
[02:38:54.792 --> 02:39:02.016]  Then when we talk about it, we're kooks who yelled, the sky is falling, when they're the ones that put out the story originally.
[02:39:02.748 --> 02:39:09.631]  So regardless, it has the psychological effect of making you think that we're on the verge of a terror attack.
[02:39:09.651 --> 02:39:18.676]  That's why they've always got to issue new alerts and things, is to keep the fear up, to keep the feeling of realism up, because there's no real terrorist other than a few special forces teams and the government.
[02:39:19.396 --> 02:39:20.117]  That's about right.
[02:39:20.137 --> 02:39:22.438]  Hey, great job on the Jeff Wren Show last night.
[02:39:23.278 --> 02:39:25.479]  Wow, everybody was, I guess, tuning into that.
[02:39:25.519 --> 02:39:26.920]  How did you tune into the Jeff Wren Show?
[02:39:28.421 --> 02:39:31.242]  I was at work, working late, and I listened to you over the internet.
[02:39:32.210 --> 02:39:34.836]  Great, well I'm glad you were on board listening to the broadcast.
[02:39:35.076 --> 02:39:35.818]  Take care, my friend.
[02:39:37.049 --> 02:39:38.830]  Wow, a lot of listeners tuned in to that last night.
[02:39:39.171 --> 02:39:40.632]  Yeah, Jeff and I are on at the same time.
[02:39:40.652 --> 02:39:44.354]  He's on from 9 to midnight live, and I do a rebroadcast 9 to midnight.
[02:39:44.374 --> 02:39:45.815]  We've got a lot of stations picking up.
[02:39:46.135 --> 02:39:49.938]  Occasionally I do it live, but I used to do 6 hours a day, day and night.
[02:39:49.958 --> 02:39:52.439]  I was just beating myself to death, so I cut back on that.
[02:39:52.459 --> 02:39:59.404]  There's also a rebroadcast from 1am to 4am overnight, so a lot of different places for stations to pick up the broadcast.
[02:39:59.644 --> 02:40:02.646]  You can always record it whenever you want and play it whenever you like as well.
[02:40:03.006 --> 02:40:05.048]  Remember that for all our great affiliates out there.
[02:40:05.968 --> 02:40:06.829]  Play it whenever you like.
[02:40:07.810 --> 02:40:12.692]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in California.
[02:40:12.752 --> 02:40:14.093]  Mike, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:40:14.113 --> 02:40:15.133]  Hey Alex.
[02:40:15.434 --> 02:40:15.734]  Hi.
[02:40:16.014 --> 02:40:16.754]  Thanks for your show.
[02:40:17.074 --> 02:40:19.236]  Thank you.
[02:40:19.276 --> 02:40:32.983]  Hey, one question and a little bit of a statement too, but the first is, where's that website where you mention that Cheney basically blatantly states his agenda for world population control and all that other stuff?
[02:40:34.535 --> 02:40:43.021]  It is the Project for a New American Century, and I believe it's .org, but just type Project for a New American Century official website.
[02:40:43.541 --> 02:40:48.144]  They also have hardcover books they put out, and then some magazine-type books.
[02:40:48.684 --> 02:40:58.390]  It's a 25-member team founded in 1997, but in one particular document, there's hundreds, written by Dick Cheney in September of 2000.
[02:41:00.180 --> 02:41:03.462]  Titled, Rebuilding America's Defenses.
[02:41:03.982 --> 02:41:07.143]  He says we need a helpful Pearl Harbor attack, a catalyzing event.
[02:41:07.503 --> 02:41:15.747]  Saddam isn't a threat, but we can use him as a pretext to invade and use Iraq as a military launch base into Iran and Syria.
[02:41:16.067 --> 02:41:23.871]  He also says we need to legitimize through the media the use of race-specific bio-weapons to kill certain races.
[02:41:24.995 --> 02:41:26.275]  You might think that's newsworthy.
[02:41:26.336 --> 02:41:26.876]  I think it is.
[02:41:27.296 --> 02:41:53.665]  Man, talking for genocide weapons, but then you hear John Yoo, who was up in Chicago, of all places, in a CFR debate with Professor Castle, who we had on two weeks ago, or about a week and a half ago to be technical, and Professor Castle, you know, brought up, well, Mr. Yoo, you authored a memo that said you can crush people's children's genitalia in front of them to get them to talk or commit genocide, and you said, yes, the President has that power.
[02:41:55.248 --> 02:41:59.329]  Sure, the president doesn't have that power, but there's that genocide thing again.
[02:41:59.649 --> 02:42:00.409]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:42:00.789 --> 02:42:08.391]  Well, we know we got some bad people on the scene, but the other thing I wanted to bring up was this.
[02:42:08.411 --> 02:42:14.073]  I heard one of your former callers last hour saying that America is going to go down.
[02:42:14.113 --> 02:42:19.834]  He referred to it as she is going down, and I think he's wrong.
[02:42:20.414 --> 02:42:21.855]  And the reason why I say that is this.
[02:42:23.308 --> 02:42:30.574]  First of all, we've got to realize who we're dealing with, and I appreciate you pointing out the fact that these guys are all worshippers of Satan and demons.
[02:42:30.594 --> 02:42:33.557]  Well, I think we're going to go down to a certain level.
[02:42:33.637 --> 02:42:36.119]  I mean, they're openly saying they're going to lower our standard of living.
[02:42:36.519 --> 02:42:42.204]  Yeah, but I mean as far as the country being absorbed and being taken over into this one-world government.
[02:42:42.324 --> 02:42:43.906]  Well, it is going to be a Pan-American Union.
[02:42:44.426 --> 02:42:45.307]  Yeah, that's what they say.
[02:42:45.787 --> 02:42:52.992]  But the thing I'm concerned with is that people understand that we're not dealing with flesh and blood, just like the Bible says.
[02:42:53.352 --> 02:42:54.433]  We're dealing with demons.
[02:42:55.013 --> 02:42:59.956]  And if we can take the demons out, which are the power behind the people, we've won.
[02:43:00.616 --> 02:43:06.000]  And we, as representatives of Christ, as members of the body of Jesus Christ,
[02:43:07.190 --> 02:43:09.671]  Well, it is true.
[02:43:09.711 --> 02:43:13.052]  We are an evil society, and the evil is what's causing this.
[02:43:13.452 --> 02:43:17.594]  Yeah, and if just a few people, I could tell you some stories that took place.
[02:43:17.614 --> 02:43:24.756]  I went to school in Chicago myself, and we had some phenomenal stuff happening as a result of prayer.
[02:43:25.416 --> 02:43:30.898]  We dealt the enemy some real wax in the head and sent him tuck tail and running.
[02:43:31.590 --> 02:43:37.151]  And that's the thing that people have to realize is that the Christians have the power to take these guys down.
[02:43:37.491 --> 02:43:38.892]  We have the power... Well, I hear you.
[02:43:38.912 --> 02:43:42.913]  I mean, the power of prayer and people getting together and people taking action at every level.
[02:43:42.933 --> 02:43:44.413]  I mean, it really does work.
[02:43:44.473 --> 02:43:46.273]  I'm very thankful for all the people that pray for me.
[02:43:46.393 --> 02:43:48.194]  I mean, I know it has an effect.
[02:43:48.234 --> 02:43:49.374]  And there's scientific studies.
[02:43:49.434 --> 02:43:52.735]  I mean, real scientific studies that have set out to disprove that.
[02:43:53.255 --> 02:43:56.577]  And it shows that, no, something is going on and it's real.
[02:43:56.937 --> 02:43:58.318]  And listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:43:58.338 --> 02:44:00.599]  I want to take a few more and then cover some final news.
[02:44:00.619 --> 02:44:04.202]  We've got about 14 minutes, or really 13 minutes left.
[02:44:04.622 --> 02:44:05.462]  Okay, let's be technical.
[02:44:05.863 --> 02:44:06.883]  13 minutes and 40 seconds.
[02:44:08.104 --> 02:44:14.948]  But, listen, this is what I'm trying to say about Christianity.
[02:44:15.709 --> 02:44:23.122]  Last night I was driving to the studio and driving back home and driving doing errands and other things and I listened to a lot of Christian radio.
[02:44:23.706 --> 02:44:30.488]  There's got to be five Christian stations that I can hear at night, just on the AM band here in Austin, and then a couple of FM's.
[02:44:30.528 --> 02:44:32.809]  And I was surfing, and it was just, it was on every channel.
[02:44:32.869 --> 02:44:37.850]  It was, it was, oh, praise God, the Antichrist is about to be here.
[02:44:37.870 --> 02:44:39.230]  In fact, they weren't even saying that.
[02:44:39.270 --> 02:44:43.612]  They were saying, they were saying Jesus is about to come back, and we don't have to do anything.
[02:44:44.332 --> 02:44:47.253]  We can just be thankful, and be quiet.
[02:44:47.693 --> 02:44:48.513]  They were saying this.
[02:44:49.193 --> 02:44:50.014]  And do nothing.
[02:44:50.194 --> 02:44:52.015]  And I mean, my Bible doesn't say that.
[02:44:52.195 --> 02:45:02.683]  So there's this message, this full court press, with all these slick preachers, with great voices, really manipulative in the way they were projecting themselves.
[02:45:02.743 --> 02:45:06.225]  And I could just... You talk about discernment, I mean, it was like wicked.
[02:45:06.345 --> 02:45:09.447]  Every channel was just wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked.
[02:45:09.788 --> 02:45:13.610]  And so I imagine the average liberal tunes into that and goes, man, listen to these people.
[02:45:14.031 --> 02:45:15.952]  I mean, because really, you can pick up on it.
[02:45:16.892 --> 02:45:17.232]  It is.
[02:45:17.312 --> 02:45:27.334]  I mean, they've bought off the churches, they've come in, they've given the big money to the preachers that spout the... Basically, it's just, we're on a train out of here, and we're going to be teleported off the planet, and there's nothing to worry about.
[02:45:27.974 --> 02:45:32.475]  And I don't want to get into some, you know, debate, but I mean, this just isn't in the Bible, folks.
[02:45:32.595 --> 02:45:42.877]  I mean, it talks about the Antichrist raging war on the saints, it talks about all this stuff happening, and then... I mean, have you ever really read the Bible?
[02:45:43.017 --> 02:45:45.878]  I don't think most of these so-called Christians have even read it.
[02:45:46.477 --> 02:45:49.760]  And it scares me because what I got from it was like on every channel.
[02:45:49.800 --> 02:45:52.162]  It must have just been my luck to tune in and hear that.
[02:45:52.723 --> 02:45:56.586]  Every channel it was just, Jesus is about to be here any minute.
[02:45:56.666 --> 02:45:57.266]  Don't worry.
[02:45:58.347 --> 02:45:59.368]  We're in the end times.
[02:45:59.989 --> 02:46:02.571]  Well, I mean, what does that even mean?
[02:46:02.911 --> 02:46:05.494]  People thought it was the end times when Hitler was killing them.
[02:46:06.574 --> 02:46:08.336]  Christians in Russia thought it was the end times.
[02:46:08.356 --> 02:46:09.757]  Christians being killed by the communists.
[02:46:10.098 --> 02:46:12.339]  Chinese, 50 years ago, thought it was the end times.
[02:46:12.720 --> 02:46:13.921]  Our founding fathers didn't.
[02:46:14.611 --> 02:46:17.015]  When the Redcoats came for the guns, they said, let's get it on.
[02:46:17.635 --> 02:46:20.219]  And they read the Bible, and it said, fight against tyranny.
[02:46:20.820 --> 02:46:27.490]  So, you know, we are a Christian nation, but I don't think people who claim they're Christians even know what that means.
[02:46:28.371 --> 02:46:40.619]  And again, I don't claim to be some super Bible scholar, but every time I just randomly open the Bible up, I'll do it a few times, and I'll just open it up, and every time I open it up, it's someone fighting evil and having their head chopped off for not going along with it.
[02:46:40.939 --> 02:46:45.342]  Instead, I hear these preachers, it's just, go along, everything's fine, just trust them.
[02:46:45.762 --> 02:46:50.125]  Let's talk to Patrick in Texas, that's the last caller, because I've got some news I've got to hit.
[02:46:50.185 --> 02:46:50.965]  Patrick, go ahead.
[02:46:51.666 --> 02:46:52.786]  Hey Alex, God bless you.
[02:46:52.987 --> 02:46:56.489]  I just think a lot of these Christians are confused in the fact that, you know,
[02:46:57.645 --> 02:47:05.891]  Christ says to Peter when he cuts off the high priest's servant's ear, you know, don't use the sword, but Christ was appointed for that time.
[02:47:05.951 --> 02:47:06.912]  It's a separate issue.
[02:47:06.972 --> 02:47:08.353]  God had to have him do that.
[02:47:08.493 --> 02:47:13.116]  So, you know, that's people get confused, and I don't think they read their Bible to let their preacher read it.
[02:47:13.717 --> 02:47:23.444]  But I just wanted to say, Alex, we do, and that caller kind of took the words out of my mouth, we do have to pray because we are dealing with evil, and you were saying it earlier about, you know, the dog and pony show.
[02:47:23.524 --> 02:47:25.385]  Is Saddam, is it really even Saddam?
[02:47:25.425 --> 02:47:26.526]  What's happening with his Lord?
[02:47:27.199 --> 02:47:30.020]  The deception is so deep, and they fool people.
[02:47:30.080 --> 02:47:35.641]  And I was at Disney World recently, and it was just really sad to see because... You gotta have biometrics to get in.
[02:47:35.661 --> 02:47:36.981]  No, you don't.
[02:47:37.042 --> 02:47:37.622]  I said no.
[02:47:37.682 --> 02:47:38.642]  I said I won't do it.
[02:47:38.722 --> 02:47:39.762]  Well, see, you refused.
[02:47:39.782 --> 02:47:40.382]  You refused.
[02:47:40.942 --> 02:47:41.843]  I refused to do it.
[02:47:41.863 --> 02:47:43.163]  I wish you'd have gotten video of that.
[02:47:43.983 --> 02:47:44.643]  Yeah, I should have.
[02:47:44.663 --> 02:47:50.685]  They said, well, you know... And the people there... But the sad thing was, Alex, there's a ton of people there from other countries.
[02:47:51.118 --> 02:47:53.539]  Because America is still the greatest country, still, even now.
[02:47:53.559 --> 02:47:56.260]  Yeah, we're now like a big promotion for the police state.
[02:47:56.300 --> 02:48:06.144]  Now when they openly torture somebody to death or kill somebody, kill a Christian for preaching or kill a Falun Gong, they say, well, America, you're a police state, too.
[02:48:06.744 --> 02:48:08.065]  Well, and here's the deal.
[02:48:08.085 --> 02:48:15.848]  We looked and, you know, I was there with my family and we're looking and you just see all these people and you never got a clearer picture of sheep.
[02:48:15.968 --> 02:48:17.109]  And they're all just going through.
[02:48:17.149 --> 02:48:20.170]  And I stopped and I was trying to educate the people and I just told the guy,
[02:48:20.796 --> 02:48:21.857]  Well, I'm not going to do this.
[02:48:21.958 --> 02:48:23.079]  And he says, well, you have to do it.
[02:48:23.099 --> 02:48:24.661]  And I said, why do I have to do it?
[02:48:24.801 --> 02:48:26.223]  He said, because we need to know who you are.
[02:48:26.263 --> 02:48:28.046]  I said, well, here's my ID.
[02:48:28.086 --> 02:48:28.967]  Here's who I am.
[02:48:29.027 --> 02:48:31.110]  You don't need... This doesn't keep anybody safe.
[02:48:31.130 --> 02:48:32.131]  This is ridiculous.
[02:48:33.689 --> 02:48:37.713]  He said, well, you know, now with 9-11, you know, it's just people are so playing a lot.
[02:48:37.753 --> 02:48:38.174]  Exactly!
[02:48:38.234 --> 02:48:39.014]  No, no, no.
[02:48:39.074 --> 02:48:40.616]  And they're there to train your kids.
[02:48:40.636 --> 02:48:42.598]  It's going in schools everywhere to get school lunches.
[02:48:42.918 --> 02:48:44.620]  It's for a national sales tax.
[02:48:45.941 --> 02:48:50.266]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.466 --> 02:48:54.810]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:55.691 --> 02:48:59.415]  A chance to use this disaster with a new world order.
[02:48:59.515 --> 02:49:02.239]  A new world order can emerge.
[02:49:02.579 --> 02:49:06.804]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.864 --> 02:49:13.792]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.932 --> 02:49:15.955]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.175 --> 02:49:26.659]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:26.919 --> 02:49:32.301]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:49:32.801 --> 02:49:36.123]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:49:36.163 --> 02:49:36.543]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:49:36.563 --> 02:49:37.843]  Order today and spread the word!
[02:49:45.712 --> 02:49:50.937]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:51.077 --> 02:49:59.184]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:49:59.424 --> 02:50:06.490]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:06.730 --> 02:50:06.970]  I think?
[02:50:26.087 --> 02:50:26.227]  I think?
[02:50:46.838 --> 02:50:47.159]  I think so.
[02:51:02.120 --> 02:51:02.721]  I think so.
[02:51:22.278 --> 02:51:22.578]  I think so.
[02:51:45.928 --> 02:51:52.892]  I've literally got like 20 articles like this today.
[02:52:10.643 --> 02:52:18.585]  And this is NetworkPipeline.com, news article, Feds want a wiretap backdoor in all net hardware and software.
[02:52:19.425 --> 02:52:26.187]  And they're trying to have an FCC mandate, just a regulation, to do that, where everything has it hardwired in.
[02:52:26.307 --> 02:52:27.568]  See, I mean, it's just every day.
[02:52:27.868 --> 02:52:29.788]  Here's one we mentioned earlier, but in more detail.
[02:52:29.988 --> 02:52:35.710]  ID protesters stopped and filmed under terror law will have police record for life.
[02:52:35.770 --> 02:52:36.510]  London Telegraph.
[02:52:37.862 --> 02:52:38.682]  This is one in Telegraph.
[02:52:39.062 --> 02:52:48.485]  A campaigner against ID cards who was stopped under counter-terror laws while collecting signatures for a petition has been told by police that his details will be kept on file indefinitely.
[02:52:48.805 --> 02:52:49.565]  It's a white guy.
[02:52:49.865 --> 02:52:51.365]  Again, you shouldn't do it to a Muslim either.
[02:52:51.405 --> 02:52:53.806]  The point is, they're just overtly doing this to everyone.
[02:52:54.166 --> 02:53:03.228]  Mark Wallace was outside the Labor Party conference in Brighton last autumn when he was selected under Section 44 and detained on the Terrorism Act of 2000.
[02:53:03.268 --> 02:53:04.929]  So that's something even before 9-11.
[02:53:05.749 --> 02:53:10.633]  The measure gives officers wide powers to stop anyone in a designated area, whether or not they are acting suspiciously.
[02:53:10.673 --> 02:53:11.854]  And that happened to me while I was in England.
[02:53:12.175 --> 02:53:13.035]  Try to interview somebody?
[02:53:13.115 --> 02:53:13.796]  Hey, back up!
[02:53:13.836 --> 02:53:14.797]  Don't turn that camera on!
[02:53:15.237 --> 02:53:16.098]  Uh, who are you?
[02:53:16.498 --> 02:53:18.140]  I'm gonna write you down and put you in the database.
[02:53:18.180 --> 02:53:18.920]  Where are you staying?
[02:53:19.341 --> 02:53:20.502]  I mean, that's your freedom!
[02:53:20.622 --> 02:53:21.523]  Oh, it's so free!
[02:53:22.985 --> 02:53:30.010]  Then the London mastermind bombers, MI6 being protected, former head of FBI counter-terrorism says the British government may be involved in the attacks.
[02:53:30.311 --> 02:53:32.452]  I mean, that isn't Alex Jones, that's John Loftus.
[02:53:32.853 --> 02:53:33.793]  Just wake up!
[02:53:33.833 --> 02:53:36.515]  You realize how late it is, folks?
[02:53:37.876 --> 02:53:46.663]  Here's Fox News, Patriot Act provision creates tighter barrier to officials at public events, a new provision tucked into the Patriot Act bills, expanded.
[02:53:47.223 --> 02:53:48.164]  Now before Congress,
[02:53:49.033 --> 02:53:57.184]  We'll allow authorities to haul demonstrators at any special event or national significance away to jail on felony charges if they are caught breaching a security perimeter.
[02:53:57.704 --> 02:54:01.910]  And it says that it can be selectively done at any time to anyone and will be felony charges.
[02:54:02.845 --> 02:54:05.407]  So, no more free speech, no more nothing.
[02:54:05.507 --> 02:54:09.891]  Rapid consumer spending helps push the savings rate to lowest level since 1933.
[02:54:10.191 --> 02:54:11.572]  That's the Associated Press.
[02:54:12.092 --> 02:54:13.614]  American personal savings rate.
[02:54:13.694 --> 02:54:14.574]  And see, that's the average.
[02:54:14.594 --> 02:54:18.217]  There's a lot of folks who do have money, but imagine an average now going into negative.
[02:54:18.357 --> 02:54:19.258]  Negative savings.
[02:54:19.598 --> 02:54:21.780]  The country, the population, is now in debt.
[02:54:22.515 --> 02:54:24.957]  It used to be we had a small savings.
[02:54:24.977 --> 02:54:26.878]  50 years ago we had the biggest savings of anybody.
[02:54:27.038 --> 02:54:27.899]  We were the wealthiest.
[02:54:27.939 --> 02:54:28.999]  Now we're going to be the poorest.
[02:54:29.460 --> 02:54:35.764]  And they're announcing from the Davos, Switzerland meeting, that they're going to have a UN tax and take our first world status away.
[02:54:35.844 --> 02:54:38.025]  I mean, they're just openly saying it!
[02:54:41.288 --> 02:54:43.989]  This is something that hasn't happened since the Great Depression.
[02:54:44.049 --> 02:54:47.912]  Consumers depleted their savings to finance the purchase of cars and other big ticket items.
[02:54:48.332 --> 02:54:49.173]  The illusion.
[02:54:49.753 --> 02:54:50.214]  Here's another one.
[02:54:50.234 --> 02:54:52.115]  Your monthly credit card payment just doubled.
[02:54:53.035 --> 02:54:54.855]  And this is out of bankrate.com.
[02:54:54.896 --> 02:55:00.817]  It's saying they're going to double, the major city bank and Bank of America are going to double their minimum monthly payment.
[02:55:01.677 --> 02:55:04.778]  So if your minimum payment is $1,000 or $500, it's going to double.
[02:55:06.939 --> 02:55:08.419]  I'm not trying to be negative, folks.
[02:55:08.479 --> 02:55:11.700]  I mean, this is the reality of what globalization has done.
[02:55:11.740 --> 02:55:14.961]  And they wrote in their own IMF documents that this was the plan.
[02:55:15.021 --> 02:55:16.141]  They want you poor.
[02:55:16.341 --> 02:55:17.501]  They want you stupid.
[02:55:17.941 --> 02:55:18.982]  It's not free market.
[02:55:19.002 --> 02:55:20.742]  They're threatened by you being independent.
[02:55:22.080 --> 02:55:22.961]  Alright, we're out of time.
[02:55:23.041 --> 02:55:28.323]  If you want to support us and what we're doing and you want tools that will wake people up, I've made powerful videos.
[02:55:28.724 --> 02:55:29.364]  I've written books.
[02:55:29.424 --> 02:55:30.124]  I've published books.
[02:55:30.144 --> 02:55:31.765]  We carry a bunch of other great books and videos.

[02:55:59.681 --> 02:56:02.423]  Great new video for the members of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:56:02.823 --> 02:56:04.564]  All my films are WhitleyTV reports.
[02:56:04.985 --> 02:56:06.986]  PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day.
[02:56:07.347 --> 02:56:08.768]  Monthly and yearly subscriptions.
[02:56:09.268 --> 02:56:10.949]  Tyrants always get out of control.
[02:56:11.009 --> 02:56:12.450]  They always feed on populations.
[02:56:12.470 --> 02:56:13.491]  They always get abusive.
[02:56:13.992 --> 02:56:15.433]  And when it gets really bad, they fall.
[02:56:15.873 --> 02:56:17.454]  Let's not let it get to that point.
[02:56:17.835 --> 02:56:18.595]  Believe me, folks.
[02:56:18.835 --> 02:56:19.756]  Tyranny ain't pretty.
[02:56:20.236 --> 02:56:21.737]  Get out there and take on the New World Order.
