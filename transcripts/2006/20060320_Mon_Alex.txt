[00:00:05.576 --> 00:00:06.238]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:07.962]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.663 --> 00:00:09.766]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.448 --> 00:00:11.189]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.997 --> 00:00:12.877]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.897 --> 00:00:17.179]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:21.860]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.903 --> 00:00:30.763]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:30.803 --> 00:00:33.444]  Thank you for joining us on this live Monday edition.
[00:00:33.684 --> 00:00:34.685]  The 20th day of March 2006.
[00:00:35.045 --> 00:00:38.866]  We'll be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.100]  We're good to go.
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.260]  I think?
[00:01:03.052 --> 00:01:11.998]  Their own CIA reports admit that it is many times worse than it was before the 12 years of sanctions, before the invasion of three years ago.
[00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.761]  The place has basically been knocked back to the Stone Age.
[00:01:16.545 --> 00:01:18.265]  So we'll be getting into that.
[00:01:18.365 --> 00:01:23.107]  Also, a major move nationwide to impeach President Bush.
[00:01:23.287 --> 00:01:28.248]  It's gained over 45 co-sponsors in the House, now getting sponsors in the Senate.
[00:01:28.768 --> 00:01:34.269]  Multiple states are moving at the state level to vote at their state houses to move for impeachment.
[00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.410]  Places like Vermont and New Hampshire.
[00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:37.720]  We're good to go.
[00:01:51.738 --> 00:01:52.618]  We're good to go.
[00:02:08.985 --> 00:02:09.565]  We're good to go.
[00:02:39.315 --> 00:02:40.176]  We're good to go.
[00:03:04.737 --> 00:03:17.746]  And Charlie and I have had a chance to talk some in the last week or so, and he's just got a few issues, a few questions he wants to bring up concerning 9-11 and what's happening here in America.
[00:03:17.806 --> 00:03:23.970]  So believe me, you're not going to want to miss the interview that is coming up after this quick break.
[00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.032]  And you can go to Infowars.com, and we've got links to...
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.046]  The different film databases and the different facts pages about Mr. Sheen.
[00:03:33.086 --> 00:03:36.691]  Of course, he comes from an activist family, Martin Sheen.
[00:03:37.886 --> 00:03:56.378]  Who is the star of the West Wing and has been immortalized by some of the movie roles that he has played, like Apocalypse Now, has always really stood up first to corruption by the federal government, especially warmongering.
[00:03:56.838 --> 00:03:58.859]  And his son is somewhat of an activist.
[00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:05.063]  In fact, both of his sons are somewhat of activists in their own right, though not as well known for activism as their father.
[00:04:05.123 --> 00:04:06.064]  Well, I think that...
[00:04:06.784 --> 00:04:14.008]  Then in the future you'll be seeing Charlie Sheen standing up more and more to the issues that he's concerned about.
[00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:32.960]  And he'll be doing some of that coming up in the next segment and talk about his hit show, Two and a Half Men, which a lot of people I talked to here in the office before Mr. Sheen was going to come on were really excited because they're big fans of that broadcast that airs every week on CBS.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.420]  So we're going to go to break.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.141]  We're going to come back.
[00:04:35.221 --> 00:04:37.362]  We're going to talk to Mr. Sheen for the rest of the hour.
[00:04:37.422 --> 00:04:46.747]  And then coming up in the second and third hour, I'll get into all the government-sponsored terror news, the Iraq news, the police state news here in America, what the secret police are up to, and a lot more.
[00:04:46.907 --> 00:04:54.491]  The websites are Infowars.com, Infowars.net, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, JonesReport.com, and many more.
[00:04:54.551 --> 00:04:54.971]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:05.252]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.492 --> 00:05:07.094]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.414 --> 00:05:12.099]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:19.186]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.506 --> 00:05:21.466]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.687 --> 00:05:24.507]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.627 --> 00:05:29.288]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.468 --> 00:05:33.889]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:41.351]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:44.012]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[00:08:02.418 --> 00:08:08.439]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.059 --> 00:08:12.100]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:22.442]  He's been in over 65 major motion pictures, produced them, written them, from Platoon to Red Dawn, one of my favorites.
[00:08:24.204 --> 00:08:26.946]  And of course, TV shows like Spin City.
[00:08:27.226 --> 00:08:32.149]  Right now he's the major star on the CBS program Two and a Half Men.
[00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:37.193]  And he's got several new movies coming out this year and next year.
[00:08:38.153 --> 00:08:41.696]  And when I got a chance to talk to Charlie Sheen, I was just amazed.
[00:08:41.736 --> 00:08:44.057]  Because I've talked to a lot of other big Hollywood people.
[00:08:44.077 --> 00:08:45.198]  We've got a few of them on this show.
[00:08:45.922 --> 00:08:46.483]  We're good to go.
[00:08:46.523 --> 00:08:46.683]  I think?
[00:09:00.502 --> 00:09:05.065]  Really knows what's going on on the planet today, but that shouldn't surprise me.
[00:09:05.105 --> 00:09:08.867]  His father, Martin Sheen, has been on the front lines.
[00:09:09.727 --> 00:09:13.949]  As Mark Twain said in the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man, hated and feared and scorned.
[00:09:13.969 --> 00:09:19.192]  But in time, when his cause succeeds, the timid join him, because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[00:09:19.572 --> 00:09:21.493]  And, of course, it's been proven right time and time again.
[00:09:21.513 --> 00:09:22.174]  It was his father.
[00:09:22.814 --> 00:09:23.594]  Nice to be here, Alex.
[00:09:23.614 --> 00:09:23.894]  How are you?
[00:09:23.914 --> 00:09:24.094]  I'm great.
[00:09:24.114 --> 00:09:27.555]  Before we get into the really serious stuff, tell me a little bit about Two and a Half Men.
[00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.371]  Well, gosh, we're thrilled.
[00:09:52.951 --> 00:09:54.891]  We are at the end of our third season.
[00:09:56.712 --> 00:09:59.732]  We have three more shows to shoot.
[00:09:59.852 --> 00:10:09.415]  Most sitcoms will shoot 22 episodes, but because the network always wants more product, we do 24.
[00:10:10.315 --> 00:10:14.136]  So our season will continue when all the other shows have shut down.
[00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:15.877]  But it's going good.
[00:10:15.917 --> 00:10:16.777]  It's going really good.
[00:10:18.473 --> 00:10:29.761]  We've found ourselves sort of in or around the top ten for most of this year, and we found out we got picked up for next season, which is fabulous.
[00:10:30.982 --> 00:10:43.912]  And what's happening is they're using our show to launch new shows, which is the sign of great confidence and trust in us sort of being the anchor of that Monday night lineup, you know?
[00:10:45.746 --> 00:10:51.249]  So with that, I should probably throw out a shameless plug on tonight's show, if that's all right.
[00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:51.670]  Oh, sure.
[00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:52.650]  Tell us about tonight's show.
[00:10:53.291 --> 00:10:58.874]  Tonight's show is entitled The Spit-Covered Cobbler.
[00:10:58.894 --> 00:11:05.178]  And it's funny because the title of our show will always relate to a line of dialogue.
[00:11:05.838 --> 00:11:13.083]  And so it's about my brother Alan, played by John Cryer, and he's dating a girl who has no money.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.001]  And so he doesn't have any money himself.
[00:11:17.541 --> 00:11:23.202]  I sort of support him on the show because I took him in when he went through a divorce with his kid, played by Angus Jones, right?
[00:11:24.302 --> 00:11:29.363]  And so he's dealing with a woman, April Bowlby, who plays Candy on the show.
[00:11:29.883 --> 00:11:33.283]  And she's fabulous and she's beautiful, but she's broke.
[00:11:33.623 --> 00:11:34.504]  Imagine that, right?
[00:11:35.164 --> 00:11:42.045]  So John is forced to pick up the tab for a lot of her bills, and that...
[00:11:43.163 --> 00:11:44.906]  That leads to some pretty funny scenarios.
[00:11:45.568 --> 00:11:47.351]  What time is that showing this evening?
[00:11:48.052 --> 00:11:51.097]  It's on CBS, 9 o'clock, 8 central.
[00:11:51.558 --> 00:11:52.841]  All right, well, I'll have to tune into that.
[00:11:53.522 --> 00:11:55.005]  Now, Mr. Sheen...
[00:11:56.093 --> 00:12:04.781]  You have some questions about the official 9-11 story, and we got hooked up because we both mutually have been looking into that.
[00:12:04.801 --> 00:12:14.770]  And I want to just, I guess, start by what happened on 9-11, what your instincts told you, and really just go from there.
[00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:20.335]  Well, it was interesting, and let me just preface that by saying that
[00:12:21.772 --> 00:12:48.176]  I've been a fan of yours for a long time and I've been following you and I've seen all of your documentaries and your research is tireless and it's interesting because a lot of these guys you sort of look behind the notes and you start to discover inconsistencies in a lot of the claims that they're making which pretty much torpedoes the credibility of most of their substance but
[00:12:48.948 --> 00:12:51.209]  With you, that's not the case.
[00:12:51.589 --> 00:12:57.713]  And I was always amazed to see that you always had hard data to back up your claims.
[00:12:58.053 --> 00:13:13.941]  And so, you know, this was tough for me because for the longest time I've been doing my own independent research and, you know, I don't claim to be an expert in any of these fields, but just as a concerned...
[00:13:15.885 --> 00:13:27.348]  There's questions I have that I wish somebody could explain away for me.
[00:13:27.988 --> 00:13:43.912]  There's things that one will view and then look at the King Commission's official report, and it just, as I heard somebody once say, might have been you, there's holes in the story you could fly a Boeing jet through.
[00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:45.790]  Oh, there certainly is.
[00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:52.352]  In fact, we were talking yesterday, and you said over the phone that the biggest conspiracy theory is the official story.
[00:13:52.392 --> 00:13:55.692]  I mean, at every point, it's a fabrication.
[00:13:56.012 --> 00:13:56.572]  It's a lie.
[00:13:56.612 --> 00:13:57.533]  Would you elaborate on that?
[00:13:58.413 --> 00:13:58.813]  Well, yeah.
[00:13:58.873 --> 00:14:06.194]  It's like they want to just pigeonhole all of us into this group of conspiracy nutbags.
[00:14:07.475 --> 00:14:09.695]  When we're not really debating things that are...
[00:14:10.643 --> 00:14:17.645]  Related to UFOs bringing down the towers or Building 7 or the Pentagon, right?
[00:14:17.785 --> 00:14:33.950]  And so it just, you know, it just feels like, you know, there's things in there that we're not the conspiracy theorists on this particular issue, you know?
[00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:39.592]  It seems to me like, you know, 19 amateurs with box cutters
[00:14:40.205 --> 00:14:46.746]  Taking over four commercial airliners and hitting 75% of their targets, that feels like a conspiracy theory.
[00:14:47.026 --> 00:14:51.907]  Well, I tell you, back in 2001, everybody admits that cell phones didn't work over 3,000 feet.
[00:14:51.927 --> 00:14:53.628]  How were they working at 33,000, 32,000 feet?
[00:14:53.688 --> 00:14:57.629]  How did Al-Qaeda make NORAD stand down?
[00:14:57.649 --> 00:15:03.310]  Did Al-Qaeda call Mayor Willie Brown of San Francisco, as the Chronicle reported, and say, don't fly to New York?
[00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:04.410]  No, the White House did.
[00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:09.073]  Did Al-Qaeda call Salman Rushdie and say, don't fly to New York on September 11th?
[00:15:09.113 --> 00:15:11.734]  No, the Times of London reported that the White House did.
[00:15:11.894 --> 00:15:22.921]  Did Al-Qaeda run drills, CIA and Pentagon drills, on the morning of 9-11 of hijacked jets hitting those exact same targets at those exact same times, and then drills the day before and drills two weeks before?
[00:15:22.941 --> 00:15:27.804]  Yeah, the answer to that would be probably not.
[00:15:28.524 --> 00:15:28.905]  But...
[00:15:31.917 --> 00:15:46.347]  No, it's just the more you look at stuff, especially specific incidents, specific events around the Faithful Day, it just raises a lot of questions.
[00:15:46.727 --> 00:15:55.773]  There's a lot of questions, and I know that a couple of years ago it was severely unpopular to discuss any of this.
[00:15:57.375 --> 00:16:07.219]  But it sort of feels like, just in my research and in the people that I talk to and in and around my circles, it seems like the worm is turning.
[00:16:08.299 --> 00:16:20.624]  Because you start talking about this, even with conservative Republicans, and they can't really debate away some of the most obvious facts
[00:16:22.037 --> 00:16:22.598]  On that day.
[00:16:22.778 --> 00:16:24.899]  Let me ask my radio producer a question.
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.421]  Did you find that clip of Dan Rather?
[00:16:28.742 --> 00:16:35.688]  Let me just roll this little 30-second clip, because this is what Dan Rather thought about 20 seconds after Building 7 collapsed.
[00:16:36.048 --> 00:16:38.990]  They backed the tape up and played it, and this is what he said live.
[00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:39.671]  Go ahead and roll it.
[00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:42.453]  Again, what you're seeing are high shots.
[00:16:44.314 --> 00:16:47.396]  Now, here we're going to show you a videotape of the collapse itself.
[00:16:48.237 --> 00:16:50.339]  Now we go to videotape the collapse of this building.
[00:16:51.383 --> 00:16:51.943]  It's amazing.
[00:16:53.224 --> 00:16:55.304]  Amazing, incredible, pick your word.
[00:16:56.265 --> 00:17:07.089]  For the third time today, it's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamites that knocked it down.
[00:17:08.189 --> 00:17:11.950]  All right, so there's Dan Rather, and that's what I thought that morning.
[00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:17.232]  That's what engineers, the heads of engineering colleges, that's what a lot of people said.
[00:17:18.112 --> 00:17:19.493]  Charlie, what did you think on that morning?
[00:17:21.354 --> 00:17:24.276]  Well, where do we start?
[00:17:24.556 --> 00:17:33.122]  I was up early, actually, and we were going to do a pre-shoot on Spin City, the show I used to do.
[00:17:34.643 --> 00:17:42.388]  And so, gosh, I was up, and I was watching the news, and the North Tower was burning.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:50.763]  And so, you know, the world was focused on what I guess they were assuming to be pilot error, right?
[00:17:50.803 --> 00:17:53.545]  Or some tragedy nobody could really explain.
[00:17:53.565 --> 00:17:57.727]  And so I saw the South Tower hit live.
[00:17:59.007 --> 00:18:03.509]  That famous wide shot where it disappears behind the building and then we see the tremendous fireball, you know?
[00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:10.833]  And it was just a... There was a feeling that it just didn't look...
[00:18:12.671 --> 00:18:13.351]  How do I say this?
[00:18:13.671 --> 00:18:20.374]  It didn't look like any commercial jetliner I've flown on any time in my life.
[00:18:21.554 --> 00:18:38.921]  And then when the buildings came down, later on that day, I was with my brother, I was at my parents' house, and we were out on the deck, and I said, hey, call me insane, but did it sort of look like those buildings came down in a controlled demolition?
[00:18:39.747 --> 00:18:46.049]  And he said, well, kind of, but gosh, that's impossible if you think about what it would take for them to orchestrate that.
[00:18:47.249 --> 00:18:54.171]  And so, as the days and the weeks went on, I was sort of told what to believe.
[00:18:54.491 --> 00:18:58.312]  And I was told through mainstream media and all of the talking heads.
[00:18:59.031 --> 00:19:00.152]  About what really happened.
[00:19:00.392 --> 00:19:10.817]  Now, Charlie, when the press hears your interview, if they think it's radical that you thought it looked like explosives, they better go talk to Dan Rather, then the host of CBS Nightly News.
[00:19:10.897 --> 00:19:14.699]  And we also have a clip of Peter Jennings saying the exact same thing twice.
[00:19:15.379 --> 00:19:16.920]  So he says it looks like bombs.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:22.463]  So I guess they'll have to dig up poor Peter Jennings and gripe at him for thinking the same thing that you and I thought.
[00:19:22.943 --> 00:19:23.343]  Of course.
[00:19:23.403 --> 00:19:26.105]  But what bothers me even more about all of this is that
[00:19:26.745 --> 00:19:29.367]  All of this stuff exists from day one.
[00:19:29.387 --> 00:19:41.336]  If you start looking at all of the news reporting after day one, the official story starts to find its way into our consciousness.
[00:19:41.416 --> 00:19:43.498]  They start telling us the conspiracy theory.
[00:19:43.518 --> 00:19:47.161]  The conspiracy theorists in the government start telling us their wild-eyed conspiracies.
[00:19:47.899 --> 00:19:48.339]  Exactly.
[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:53.783]  And so we all go away from what we felt in our gut initially.
[00:19:54.183 --> 00:19:55.424]  Charlie Sheen, stay right there.
[00:19:55.464 --> 00:19:56.164]  We've got a break.
[00:19:56.184 --> 00:19:57.065]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:57.485 --> 00:19:58.546]  Folks, strap yourselves in.
[00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:04.933]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:20:04.993 --> 00:20:09.176]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:20:09.416 --> 00:20:12.198]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:20:12.398 --> 00:20:14.800]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:23.647]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:20:23.827 --> 00:20:25.188]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:20:25.368 --> 00:20:29.531]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:20:29.791 --> 00:20:30.291]  We're good to go.
[00:20:48.863 --> 00:20:49.584]  We're good to go.
[00:21:19.085 --> 00:21:19.325]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:19.345 --> 00:21:19.605]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:45.951 --> 00:21:47.714]  Don't be lost in a sea of confusion.
[00:21:48.295 --> 00:21:50.057]  Get the 2006 Red Buck.
[00:21:50.658 --> 00:21:52.481]  Help steer your own financial ship.
[00:21:53.122 --> 00:21:54.023]  Call Midas now.
[00:21:54.043 --> 00:21:54.104]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:04.311]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:04.811 --> 00:22:11.974]  Did you know that one of the 45 points of international communism to capture America was to gain control of one or both political parties?
[00:22:12.854 --> 00:22:17.456]  Have you noticed that it doesn't matter which political party, Republican or Democrat, takes office?
[00:22:17.656 --> 00:22:25.959]  We continue in the same direction of losing our freedoms and ultimately our national sovereignty to the United Nations, which is a communist organization.
[00:22:26.839 --> 00:22:27.280]  We're good to go.
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:27.520]  I think?
[00:22:49.248 --> 00:22:50.049]  516-8736.
[00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:52.310]  Call now.
[00:22:52.991 --> 00:22:59.275]  Operators are standing by to receive your call for a one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:01.056 --> 00:23:03.117]  Gee, honey, those new sandals look great on you.
[00:23:03.337 --> 00:23:05.579]  And look, they show off my new toenails, too.
[00:23:05.879 --> 00:23:06.560]  New toenails?
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:07.920]  What happened to the old ones?
[00:23:08.901 --> 00:23:11.583]  Well, they're not really new, just clear and healthy looking.
[00:23:12.099 --> 00:23:13.540]  Remember how embarrassed I was?
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.342]  They were so discolored, really awful looking.
[00:23:16.583 --> 00:23:17.944]  Well, they sure look clear now.
[00:23:18.384 --> 00:23:20.065]  Gosh, I wish I could wear sandals again.
[00:23:20.225 --> 00:23:21.587]  My toenails are a disaster.
[00:23:21.627 --> 00:23:24.449]  Look, this one looks white, and that one's thick and yellow.
[00:23:24.649 --> 00:23:25.910]  Well, here's my secret.
[00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:27.511]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:23:27.992 --> 00:23:32.075]  It clears out yellowing keratin debris, the source of nail discoloration.
[00:23:32.775 --> 00:23:33.676]  Ah, so that's it.
[00:23:33.916 --> 00:23:36.478]  I've got ugly keratin debris built up under my nails.
[00:23:36.759 --> 00:23:38.380]  And Non-X Nail Gel gets rid of it.
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:41.963]  You'll need to use it every day, but clear nails are worth it.
[00:23:42.343 --> 00:23:42.904]  You bet.
[00:23:43.124 --> 00:23:47.228]  You know, when we go to the beach this summer, my toenails are going to look just as good as yours do.
[00:23:47.368 --> 00:23:48.889]  Thanks to Nonex Nail Gel.
[00:23:49.289 --> 00:23:50.430]  Nonex Nail Gel.
[00:23:50.611 --> 00:23:52.272]  For clear, healthy-looking nails.
[00:23:52.632 --> 00:23:57.717]  Now at Walgreens, Rite Aid, Eckerd, Brooks, Longs, Duane Reade, and Walmart.
[00:23:57.937 --> 00:23:58.958]  In the foot care section.
[00:24:12.935 --> 00:24:18.421]  No, we're not backing down.
[00:24:19.482 --> 00:24:20.763]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:22.044 --> 00:24:26.429]  There are those attempting to break down the sovereignty and the freedoms that are in this country, and they're failing.
[00:24:26.849 --> 00:24:30.693]  More and more Americans, as Charlie Sheen said, are waking up.
[00:24:30.733 --> 00:24:32.195]  The worm has turned.
[00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:40.397]  And I was talking to Charlie yesterday, and I talked about how when I brought up my facts on 9-11 just days after it happened, a lot of people disagree with me.
[00:24:40.477 --> 00:24:44.822]  Now, not just on my own broadcast, but on so many other shows, really no one calls in to disagree.
[00:24:44.842 --> 00:24:49.126]  Many of you as listeners in your local area have heard me on your local station with a talk show host attacking me.
[00:24:49.586 --> 00:24:51.147]  And everyone calls into my defense.
[00:24:51.227 --> 00:24:54.528]  So people instinctively know that something is wrong.
[00:24:55.008 --> 00:24:56.509]  And 9-11 is just part of that.
[00:24:56.769 --> 00:25:05.813]  We're talking to, of course, a legendary actor, star of screen and, of course, television, poet and writer, you name it, and Charlie Sheen.
[00:25:05.833 --> 00:25:08.674]  Charlie, there's so many facets to 9-11, but what about WTC7?
[00:25:10.447 --> 00:25:12.328]  I mean, it wasn't even hit by a building.
[00:25:12.348 --> 00:25:14.088]  47-story structure.
[00:25:14.108 --> 00:25:15.408]  It has two small fires in it.
[00:25:16.008 --> 00:25:18.809]  A modern steel building that never collapsed from fire.
[00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:25.430]  The Madrid fire last year, it burned for two days with 150-something foot white-hot flames and nothing collapsed there.
[00:25:25.831 --> 00:25:27.391]  What happened with Building 7, in your opinion?
[00:25:27.411 --> 00:25:28.971]  A little curious, isn't it?
[00:25:29.972 --> 00:25:30.932]  It's a little bit curious.
[00:25:31.272 --> 00:25:35.593]  It just seems odd that an event...
[00:25:37.699 --> 00:25:46.666]  Something that we all witnessed, because September 11th wasn't the Zapruder Film, it was the Zapruder Film Festival, okay?
[00:25:47.286 --> 00:25:55.812]  And I think that, what was the great Hoover quote about the bigger the lie?
[00:25:56.388 --> 00:25:58.089]  The easier it is to pass over on people.
[00:25:58.329 --> 00:25:58.610]  Yes.
[00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:00.451]  I mangled it.
[00:26:00.531 --> 00:26:00.891]  I'm paraphrasing.
[00:26:00.931 --> 00:26:04.274]  Well, no, Hitler had a similar one about the bigger the lie, the more they'll buy it.
[00:26:04.654 --> 00:26:04.954]  Sure.
[00:26:05.014 --> 00:26:05.514]  There you go.
[00:26:05.855 --> 00:26:06.335]  There you go.
[00:26:06.355 --> 00:26:17.503]  Let me just throw out a quote just because, you know, we're 20 minutes into this and I'm sure I'm being demonized across the nation by, you know, all of the people that do that sort of thing.
[00:26:18.183 --> 00:26:21.346]  But people see through the propaganda organs now like they never have before.
[00:26:21.746 --> 00:26:22.166]  Well, good.
[00:26:22.627 --> 00:26:22.907]  Good.
[00:26:23.067 --> 00:26:23.487]  Finally.
[00:26:24.508 --> 00:26:25.469]  There's a couple of quotes here.
[00:26:26.573 --> 00:26:32.658]  The first is, it is unpatriotic not to tell the truth, whether about the president or anyone else.
[00:26:33.479 --> 00:26:44.007]  The second quote from this same gentleman is that we are to stand by the president, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.
[00:26:44.467 --> 00:26:45.308]  Theodore Roosevelt.
[00:26:45.688 --> 00:26:47.670]  Yes, well, I mean, that's what the founding fathers said.
[00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:49.231]  It's our job to be watchdogs.
[00:26:49.251 --> 00:26:53.695]  The Declaration of Independence clearly states that in our seminal founding document.
[00:26:54.656 --> 00:26:55.076]  Absolutely.
[00:26:55.532 --> 00:27:01.920]  Yeah, and we've been coerced away from these founding principles.
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:09.969]  We've been told you're either with us or you're with the terrorists, and we've been told never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning 9-11.
[00:27:10.029 --> 00:27:11.351]  Bush said that at the UN.
[00:27:11.811 --> 00:27:12.232]  Yes, he did.
[00:27:12.842 --> 00:27:13.362]  Yes, he did.
[00:27:13.422 --> 00:27:17.503]  That would direct the blame away from those responsible, blah, blah, blah.
[00:27:18.783 --> 00:27:20.864]  Back to Building 7, yeah.
[00:27:21.044 --> 00:27:31.387]  You pointed out in one of your documentaries that in a classic controlled demolition, that they create what's first called a crease, is that correct?
[00:27:31.587 --> 00:27:32.467]  Or a wrinkle?
[00:27:33.467 --> 00:27:36.268]  Crease, wrinkle, cramp, all those are used, yes.
[00:27:36.288 --> 00:27:37.428]  They blow the central column.
[00:27:37.948 --> 00:27:40.929]  Right, and the term pull is about pulling...
[00:27:41.613 --> 00:27:44.115]  The outer walls toward the center of the building, correct?
[00:27:44.236 --> 00:27:44.476]  Yes.
[00:27:46.318 --> 00:27:50.802]  So you minimize the damage, and that way you bring a building down on its own footprint.
[00:27:51.903 --> 00:27:52.563]  Correct.
[00:27:52.663 --> 00:27:56.687]  And many controlled demolition experts said they've never seen a prettier job than Building 7.
[00:27:57.308 --> 00:27:57.989]  Yeah, gosh.
[00:27:58.149 --> 00:28:02.513]  And there was a guy, I can't remember his name, but scientifically he broke down...
[00:28:03.169 --> 00:28:10.252]  That the building actually fell faster than the speed of gravity because of the explosive vacuum that was created.
[00:28:10.832 --> 00:28:22.296]  Well, a lot of different physicists, a physics professor at BYU, Stephen Jones has done that, Underwriting Laboratories, Kevin Ryan, who was there.
[00:28:22.436 --> 00:28:23.657]  That guy got fired, right?
[00:28:23.897 --> 00:28:26.358]  Yes, he said, we did our own test, and it's impossible.
[00:28:26.398 --> 00:28:28.798]  Steel doesn't melt until thousands of degrees.
[00:28:29.298 --> 00:28:32.259]  Around 3,000 it weakens, and jet fuel burns at 1,200 to 1,400.
[00:28:32.359 --> 00:28:33.520]  It's impossible.
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.860]  Well, that's 1,200 at optimum conditions, right?
[00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:37.421]  Yes.
[00:28:37.901 --> 00:28:47.783]  Yeah, and then you've got Silverstein, the leaseholder, the owner of Seven as well as the rest of the complex, right?
[00:28:49.224 --> 00:28:50.724]  On tape, on the record...
[00:28:51.465 --> 00:28:51.846]  Same.
[00:28:51.866 --> 00:28:57.975]  We've had such a terrible loss of life that day, and I made the decision that they should go ahead and pull it.
[00:28:58.216 --> 00:29:00.058]  And we gave the order and watched the building come down?
[00:29:00.459 --> 00:29:00.720]  Yeah.
[00:29:02.168 --> 00:29:08.752]  Well, pull is the... I mean, that's as common to the demo world as action and cut to the movie world.
[00:29:08.972 --> 00:29:24.362]  In fact, in the same PBS documentary narrated by Kevin Spacey, or not Kevin Spacey, the other guy, he comes right out and says... They cut to one of the other engineers demoing a building, and he says, we're getting ready to pull it.
[00:29:25.262 --> 00:29:25.903]  And then they pull it.
[00:29:25.923 --> 00:29:29.105]  We're going to come back, in fact, and play some of those clips.
[00:29:30.185 --> 00:29:30.946]  On the other side...
[00:29:32.243 --> 00:29:33.324]  We're on the march.
[00:29:33.384 --> 00:29:34.844]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:35.025 --> 00:29:37.246]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.482 --> 00:30:02.584]  You don't love me anymore.
[00:30:02.884 --> 00:30:04.707]  You used to take such good care of me.
[00:30:04.727 --> 00:30:06.209]  Is that my car talking to me?
[00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:06.650]  Yes.
[00:30:06.951 --> 00:30:07.792]  You neglect me.
[00:30:07.972 --> 00:30:09.955]  Change my oil late most of the time.
[00:30:11.778 --> 00:30:12.800]  Use the cheapest gas.
[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:14.002]  I'm getting sick.
[00:30:14.322 --> 00:30:16.506]  One of these days, I'm just gonna give up.
[00:30:17.546 --> 00:30:18.027]  Wait a minute.
[00:30:18.107 --> 00:30:19.747]  I've got three more years of payments on you.
[00:30:19.968 --> 00:30:28.532]  If you want me to last forever, you need to add protected engine treatment, protected transmission treatment, and especially protected complete fuel system treatment.
[00:30:28.992 --> 00:30:34.455]  Protected unique synthetic fortifiers treat the metal and the oil to reduce friction like no other.
[00:30:34.675 --> 00:30:37.076]  Okay, I'll add some protecta, but you'll have to perform.
[00:30:37.216 --> 00:30:41.901]  How about faster acceleration, more horsepower, longer lasting?
[00:30:42.101 --> 00:30:43.763]  I'll always be there for you.
[00:30:43.963 --> 00:30:47.286]  So if you want more, treat it right with Protecta by SFR.

[00:31:01.997 --> 00:31:06.960]  Now you can bring Berkey purification power anywhere with the Sport Berkey filtration bottle.
[00:31:07.281 --> 00:31:12.704]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[00:31:12.744 --> 00:31:17.047]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[00:31:17.387 --> 00:31:20.389]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:24.132]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[00:31:24.472 --> 00:31:33.819]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkeys patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:31:34.079 --> 00:31:37.581]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[00:31:37.822 --> 00:31:44.927]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:08.271]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:32:08.491 --> 00:32:13.493]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[00:32:13.813 --> 00:32:21.736]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:21.876 --> 00:32:28.919]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:29.139 --> 00:32:30.341]  There are no side effects.
[00:32:30.501 --> 00:32:33.886]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:32:33.946 --> 00:32:35.067]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:32:35.368 --> 00:32:36.630]  Eliminate the cause.
[00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:43.679]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:46.223]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[00:32:50.484 --> 00:32:53.865]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:32:53.905 --> 00:32:56.405]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:14.452 --> 00:33:18.214]  Well, he comes from a family of actors, and he's one of the most accomplished.
[00:33:18.234 --> 00:33:19.354]  He's Charlie Sheen.
[00:33:20.095 --> 00:33:21.135]  They're also activists.
[00:33:22.676 --> 00:33:34.802]  And he has starred in over 65 major films, and a couple new ones coming out this year, and of course he'll be on tonight, 8 o'clock Central Time on CBS for Two and a Half Men, which he is the main star of the show on.
[00:33:35.442 --> 00:33:42.926]  But he joins us today to talk about, well, just the state of the world, and some of the interesting things that are happening, and some of the foundational events that are the
[00:33:43.732 --> 00:33:45.174]  We're good to go.
[00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:57.921]  What's the new definition of freedom?
[00:33:57.941 --> 00:34:00.082]  It's surveillance and not having freedom.
[00:34:00.142 --> 00:34:03.063]  So it's a lot of double speak and double think.
[00:34:03.243 --> 00:34:05.664]  And Charlie Sheen again is our guest.
[00:34:06.005 --> 00:34:07.245]  I want to play a clip.
[00:34:07.305 --> 00:34:14.088]  He mentioned this clip from America Rebuilds, a 2002 PBS documentary.
[00:34:14.249 --> 00:34:16.570]  And it is narrated by Kevin Spacey.
[00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:21.872]  And here is Larry Silverstein, the owner, who took out $7 million of insurance on the two towers.
[00:34:22.352 --> 00:34:25.354]  And he's also now bought the Sears Tower and taken out a bunch of insurance and
[00:34:26.755 --> 00:34:33.458]  Governor Pataki just called him the lowest of the low in the newspaper because he's holding out for a billion more now.
[00:34:33.858 --> 00:34:34.759]  Interesting fellow.
[00:34:35.839 --> 00:34:36.920]  Made out quite well.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:39.641]  And here is his statement from America Rebuilds.
[00:34:40.361 --> 00:34:46.585]  I remember getting a call from the fire department commander telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[00:34:46.605 --> 00:34:50.166]  And I said, you know, we've had such terrible loss of life.
[00:34:50.186 --> 00:34:53.108]  Maybe this is one of those things to do is pull it.
[00:34:54.651 --> 00:34:59.594]  They made that decision to pull until we watched the building collapse.
[00:35:00.035 --> 00:35:02.336]  They made the decision to pull.
[00:35:02.856 --> 00:35:03.537]  They made.
[00:35:04.097 --> 00:35:05.278]  They made the decision.
[00:35:05.851 --> 00:35:06.411]  We're good to go.
[00:35:06.431 --> 00:35:06.651]  I think?
[00:35:31.763 --> 00:35:36.664]  Then the crimp in the middle, the top of the building imploding downwards, and then it falls in on itself.
[00:35:37.804 --> 00:35:43.145]  Going back to our guest, Mr. Sheen, that is the clip you mentioned with Mr. Silverstein.
[00:35:43.565 --> 00:35:44.045]  Yes, it is.
[00:35:44.165 --> 00:35:47.846]  Let me just play devil's advocate for a second.
[00:35:51.327 --> 00:35:54.847]  Again, I don't claim to be an expert about structural integrity.
[00:35:54.867 --> 00:35:56.968]  I don't claim to be an expert about demolitions.
[00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:07.089]  Could they have rigged that building during the day when they decided that the fire was out of hand, even though it was only in a couple of floors?
[00:36:07.289 --> 00:36:07.650]  No way.
[00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:09.612]  They could have blown the whole thing to bits.
[00:36:10.579 --> 00:36:15.824]  With just a mass of explosives down low, but they couldn't engage in precision demolitions.
[00:36:15.844 --> 00:36:16.464]  It would take weeks.
[00:36:16.905 --> 00:36:17.505]  Okay, good.
[00:36:17.725 --> 00:36:18.126]  Good to know.
[00:36:18.166 --> 00:36:19.046]  That's what I think.
[00:36:19.287 --> 00:36:24.331]  But, again, I'm just throwing stuff out that somebody might present as a viable argument.
[00:36:24.471 --> 00:36:28.354]  Well, the engineers that have looked at it who aren't on government payroll have said just what you're saying.
[00:36:28.394 --> 00:36:31.557]  The heads of mining colleges, the heads of physics departments...
[00:36:32.177 --> 00:36:38.943]  The head individual who checked into it from Underwriter Laboratories, they're saying what you're saying.
[00:36:38.963 --> 00:36:45.628]  But the problem is they tried to hire Henry Kissinger, and then they hired Keene, all Bush business partners, to run the 9-11 Whitewash Commission.
[00:36:45.648 --> 00:36:46.568]  What did you think of the commission?
[00:36:49.951 --> 00:36:53.013]  Not much, because it didn't really answer a lot of the hard questions.
[00:36:53.033 --> 00:37:00.179]  Let me ask you, though, how long did it take to start an investigation after, I don't know, Pearl Harbor?
[00:37:01.488 --> 00:37:02.009]  About a day.
[00:37:02.469 --> 00:37:04.110]  Okay.
[00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:04.711]  The Titanic.
[00:37:05.792 --> 00:37:06.773]  It started that day.
[00:37:07.794 --> 00:37:08.274]  JFK.
[00:37:08.995 --> 00:37:09.635]  Started that day.
[00:37:10.116 --> 00:37:11.237]  Yeah.
[00:37:11.257 --> 00:37:11.537]  9-11?
[00:37:12.538 --> 00:37:13.899]  Started about a year later.
[00:37:14.519 --> 00:37:14.820]  Yeah.
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:19.584]  Yeah, and then the investigation was ordered to be limited in its scope.
[00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:28.987]  Well, they had armed guards over every piece of steel and put GPS equipment on each piece, and if a guy pulled over to get a hamburger for ten minutes, he'd be fired and then criminally charged.
[00:37:29.027 --> 00:37:32.149]  That's what they actually did, and they shipped it to China under guard.
[00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:42.837]  Yeah, well, that bothers me because Giuliani, as a former prosecutor, knows the value of evidence preservation and crime scene preservation.
[00:37:44.151 --> 00:37:54.534]  I understand that they were on the clock, and they were still looking for victims, and they were still looking for bodies, and they were still hoping, beyond hope, that there were survivors, but... But not a week into it, not a month into it.
[00:37:55.134 --> 00:37:55.915]  No, I know.
[00:37:56.675 --> 00:37:57.015]  I know.
[00:37:57.335 --> 00:38:06.458]  So, the thing that I can't get my mind off of is that if there's a problem with Building 7, there's a problem with the whole thing.
[00:38:07.273 --> 00:38:07.793]  Well, you're right.
[00:38:07.833 --> 00:38:09.674]  What about firefighters on record?
[00:38:09.734 --> 00:38:17.419]  Major newspapers say they found three of the voice recorders, data recorders, and then the FBI said, don't tell anybody about this, and shipped them off.
[00:38:18.359 --> 00:38:20.480]  Yeah, and we've never had access to that data, have we?
[00:38:20.781 --> 00:38:21.001]  No.
[00:38:21.661 --> 00:38:21.881]  No.
[00:38:23.002 --> 00:38:28.465]  Yeah, just the fact that the entire event is so shrouded in secrecy.
[00:38:28.505 --> 00:38:33.287]  They ordered the FAA to destroy the tapes as well, the tapes they recorded at the towers.
[00:38:34.908 --> 00:38:35.269]  Yeah.
[00:38:37.725 --> 00:38:37.985]  I know.
[00:38:39.527 --> 00:38:44.391]  Again, I'm not coming on your show to say, I know who did it, I know how they did it, and I know why they did it.
[00:38:44.811 --> 00:38:54.920]  I'm just coming on to talk about what we've been told as a public, and again, a lot of it is pretty...
[00:38:57.717 --> 00:38:59.358]  Silly, for lack of a better term.
[00:39:00.178 --> 00:39:01.858]  Something's rotten in the state of Denmark.
[00:39:01.898 --> 00:39:03.699]  We know there hasn't been a real investigation.
[00:39:03.739 --> 00:39:04.959]  In fact, there's been a cover-up.
[00:39:05.439 --> 00:39:08.240]  And when you normally see a cover-up going on, that's pretty suspicious.
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.061]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:39:10.081 --> 00:39:12.341]  Let me ask you this, though.
[00:39:13.642 --> 00:39:23.225]  Everybody's now familiar with the famous Andrew Card Bush ear whisperer at the elementary school.
[00:39:23.245 --> 00:39:23.745]  Oh, yes.
[00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:33.579]  That whole incident is problematic to me, because as we talked about yesterday, it was broadcast three days in advance, his schedule, correct?
[00:39:33.599 --> 00:39:34.359]  The President's schedule?
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:34.860]  Yes, sir.
[00:39:35.401 --> 00:39:41.267]  Yes, so, conservatively, if that event was being broadcast live, right?
[00:39:41.767 --> 00:39:41.988]  Yes.
[00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:47.934]  How many people in the state of Florida knew where the President was at that specific point in time?
[00:39:49.788 --> 00:39:52.751]  Basically, the entire population that watched the TV news.
[00:39:52.791 --> 00:39:53.612]  It was a big event.
[00:39:54.112 --> 00:39:54.413]  Okay.
[00:39:54.553 --> 00:39:54.833]  All right.
[00:39:54.933 --> 00:40:02.961]  So, if, in fact, he was being informed that the second plane had hit, America's under attack, right?
[00:40:03.361 --> 00:40:03.962]  Isn't he then...
[00:40:05.515 --> 00:40:09.676]  Putting everybody in his immediate circle at great risk?
[00:40:09.916 --> 00:40:12.157]  Including that school full of elementary students.
[00:40:12.637 --> 00:40:13.618]  That's what I'm talking about, yeah.
[00:40:14.078 --> 00:40:23.341]  Yeah, so it would seem to me that upon the revelation of that news, that the Secret Service would grab the president and remove him.
[00:40:24.725 --> 00:40:27.386]  As if he were on fire from that room.
[00:40:27.626 --> 00:40:32.147]  Well, you're right, and he was only about ten minutes away from a major airport.
[00:40:32.267 --> 00:40:38.269]  And they were saying they thought there were hijackers all over the country, and everyone's in incredible fear.
[00:40:38.369 --> 00:40:47.931]  But, oh, George Bush, he just sits there after he's told the second plane has hit for around 20 minutes and then kind of just ambles out, taking his time.
[00:40:48.471 --> 00:40:53.416]  Of course, some Secret Service did say, let's get him out, and then Card and others just said, no, we're going to stay.
[00:40:53.456 --> 00:40:54.296]  I wonder what they knew.
[00:40:54.316 --> 00:41:01.763]  You know, it's funny, Jeb Bush declared martial law three days before, too, and that was kind of kept just a little bit quiet as well.
[00:41:02.264 --> 00:41:03.525]  Did Jeb Bush ever explain why?
[00:41:04.145 --> 00:41:06.867]  No, he wouldn't say why, and Bush wouldn't say why.
[00:41:06.887 --> 00:41:09.909]  They had massed 44,000 U.S.
[00:41:10.289 --> 00:41:22.618]  troops, 18,000 British troops in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, and had carrier attack groups about to launch their attacks on Afghanistan, and he had that order signed on his desk just waiting two days before 9-11.
[00:41:22.938 --> 00:41:30.383]  That was incredibly convenient to have your whole military stacked up and ready to go into Afghanistan, something that took about six months to build up, I'm told.
[00:41:31.485 --> 00:41:34.607]  Yeah, because you don't really put those strategies together overnight, do you?
[00:41:35.628 --> 00:41:37.089]  No, and they haven't tripped in once.
[00:41:37.169 --> 00:41:38.490]  For a major invasion, no.
[00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:43.814]  No, those are really well calculated and really well planned, at least from this government.
[00:41:45.435 --> 00:41:46.075]  Well, you're right.
[00:41:48.237 --> 00:41:49.057]  But let me ask you this.
[00:41:50.618 --> 00:41:58.384]  In a statement that the president made following, I think it was a school kid that asked him, what did you think when the first plane hit?
[00:41:59.733 --> 00:42:05.657]  And he said something to the effect of, I was watching it on TV like everybody else, and I thought, oh gosh, that's a pilot error.
[00:42:05.917 --> 00:42:06.238]  Correct?
[00:42:06.538 --> 00:42:06.818]  Yes.
[00:42:07.458 --> 00:42:12.382]  So I guess one of the perks of being president is you get access to TV channels.
[00:42:13.064 --> 00:42:15.526]  That don't exist in the known universe, correct?
[00:42:16.006 --> 00:42:16.386]  That's right.
[00:42:16.426 --> 00:42:21.970]  He said, yeah, I saw it on TV, the first plane hit, and I thought, that guy's got to be a terrible pilot.
[00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:29.555]  Then his spokesman, a day later, because the San Francisco Chronicle did the whole timeline, his spokesman said, no, he never saw that, he didn't mean that.
[00:42:30.373 --> 00:42:42.355]  He wasn't even aware the first building had been hit when he went out to give the speech, but then the Times of London and AP had photos of him watching the first tower smoking after it had been announced there in the green room.
[00:42:42.375 --> 00:42:43.896]  So we also have a lot of lying going on.
[00:42:45.076 --> 00:42:45.416]  Yeah.
[00:42:45.576 --> 00:42:55.838]  I mean, it might lead to believe that he'd seen similar images in some type of a...
[00:42:57.117 --> 00:42:57.698]  Rehearsal.
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:00.380]  As it were.
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.102]  Yes.
[00:43:02.762 --> 00:43:07.987]  What did you think of the guns being taken from the pilots just a few months before in July?
[00:43:08.447 --> 00:43:11.570]  The federal law being changed by Bush so pilots couldn't carry firearms.
[00:43:12.611 --> 00:43:13.712]  That's a little convenient, isn't it?
[00:43:15.473 --> 00:43:20.958]  Because that was instituted post-Cuban Missile Crisis, correct?
[00:43:21.098 --> 00:43:21.439]  Yes, sir.
[00:43:22.039 --> 00:43:23.681]  Yeah, so that had been in place for almost 40 years.
[00:43:27.254 --> 00:43:33.468]  It's right in there with, I guess it was June or July of 2001, when after 46 years, Cheney changed.
[00:43:37.268 --> 00:43:39.029]  The authorization for the shoot-down orders.
[00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:40.210]  Oh, that's right.
[00:43:40.611 --> 00:43:47.316]  Since NORAD was shut up in the late 50s, generals and admirals had standing shoot-down orders of errant aircraft like Payne Stewart.
[00:43:47.336 --> 00:43:49.277]  They were ready in that case a few years before.
[00:43:50.038 --> 00:43:57.123]  But magically, he took the power away from all the generals and only gave it to himself and to his adjunct, the Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld.
[00:43:57.683 --> 00:43:57.924]  Yeah.
[00:43:58.724 --> 00:44:06.350]  Yeah, no, again, you know, I'm not on your show to say who did it or why, because I don't have those answers.
[00:44:06.954 --> 00:44:10.535]  Yeah, we just shouldn't have an investigation by their very people that turns out to be a whitewash.
[00:44:10.575 --> 00:44:19.139]  I mean, the 9-11 Commission, we talked yesterday about how the Commission claimed there weren't even support pillars in the middle of Tower 1 and 2 when it had the biggest columns in the world up until that time.
[00:44:19.959 --> 00:44:20.859]  Yeah, it had how many?
[00:44:20.879 --> 00:44:20.859]  47.
[00:44:20.899 --> 00:44:23.660]  47, that's right, yeah.
[00:44:24.081 --> 00:44:35.445]  And it would seem to me, just based on what we've all seen, those images that are indelibly emblazoned into our memories forever, again...
[00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:36.269]  Yes, I did.
[00:44:36.289 --> 00:44:36.329]  So...
[00:44:54.344 --> 00:45:08.256]  I have a hard time believing that a fireball traveled down the elevator over 1,100 feet and still had the explosive energy to destroy the lobby like it was described.
[00:45:08.636 --> 00:45:16.023]  Well, we can fill a two-hour film just with quick cuts of different firefighters and police saying they saw bombs going off.
[00:45:16.363 --> 00:45:16.843]  We're good to go.
[00:45:35.788 --> 00:45:38.169]  Yeah, and this one guy in that famous clip talks about it.
[00:45:38.189 --> 00:45:42.392]  It looked like one of those boom, boom, boom, boom, boom controlled detonations.
[00:45:42.452 --> 00:45:43.393]  In fact, we have that clip.
[00:45:43.433 --> 00:45:45.074]  Now, there's two in the computer, John, so be careful.
[00:45:45.174 --> 00:45:46.895]  One hasn't been edited.
[00:45:47.155 --> 00:45:47.795]  Don't air that one.
[00:45:47.815 --> 00:45:48.175]  Be careful.
[00:45:48.636 --> 00:45:49.736]  Last time we almost had a mistake.
[00:45:50.197 --> 00:45:54.459]  Can you find the one where the firefighters are saying, it looked as if they had detonators.
[00:45:54.479 --> 00:45:55.500]  Are you talking about that one?
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:57.221]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, yeah.
[00:45:57.601 --> 00:46:05.323]  And then now there are films that have come out, and of course I have all these clips, but there are films that just have an hour and a half of just that, Charlie.
[00:46:05.703 --> 00:46:05.963]  Yeah.
[00:46:06.083 --> 00:46:07.604]  Of different firemen saying that.
[00:46:08.164 --> 00:46:08.644]  Sure.
[00:46:08.824 --> 00:46:15.966]  And again, this is not you and I watching the video, you know, speculating about what we think we saw.
[00:46:15.986 --> 00:46:21.387]  These are gentlemen, you know, inside the buildings saying,
[00:46:22.704 --> 00:46:25.926]  At the very point of collapse.
[00:46:25.986 --> 00:46:27.167]  Let's go ahead and roll that next clip.
[00:46:27.187 --> 00:46:27.507]  Here it is.
[00:46:27.867 --> 00:46:28.048]  Sure.
[00:46:28.088 --> 00:46:28.868]  We made it outside.
[00:46:28.908 --> 00:46:30.469]  We made it about a block.
[00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:32.331]  We made it at least two blocks.
[00:46:32.511 --> 00:46:34.632]  And we started running.
[00:46:34.673 --> 00:46:35.453]  Floor by floor.
[00:46:35.473 --> 00:46:36.654]  It started popping out.
[00:46:36.754 --> 00:46:38.475]  It was detonated.
[00:46:38.776 --> 00:46:42.218]  Yeah, detonated.
[00:46:42.358 --> 00:46:42.899]  All the way down.
[00:46:42.939 --> 00:46:44.380]  I was watching it and running.
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:45.100]  It ran up.
[00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:48.303]  And then you just sort of, this cloud of... chasing you down.
[00:46:48.903 --> 00:46:49.825]  I couldn't outrun it.
[00:46:49.965 --> 00:46:51.428]  I couldn't outrun it.
[00:46:51.488 --> 00:46:52.870]  I jumped behind a battalion car.
[00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:53.631]  I hit under the car.
[00:46:53.671 --> 00:46:54.593]  I just went and died.
[00:46:56.356 --> 00:46:56.536]  So...
[00:46:58.797 --> 00:47:00.618]  Mr. Sheen, what do you think we should do then?
[00:47:00.658 --> 00:47:01.659]  I mean, this is a citizen.
[00:47:01.699 --> 00:47:02.419]  You have that right.
[00:47:02.739 --> 00:47:03.700]  What do you think we should do?
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:06.501]  I mean, what type of... What would be a real investigation?
[00:47:06.521 --> 00:47:20.969]  What would satisfy you, who, according to most Americans in major polls, a CNN poll, 90%, a Zobby poll, 49%, take whatever poll you want, but more than half of Americans in major polls want some type of real investigation.
[00:47:20.989 --> 00:47:21.790]  What would you like to see?
[00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:23.851]  I would like to see the same thing.
[00:47:23.871 --> 00:47:24.732]  I think it's got to be...
[00:47:27.091 --> 00:47:34.446]  It's got to be hit by, if this is possible, some neutral investigative committee.
[00:47:37.212 --> 00:47:37.733]  I don't know...
[00:47:38.763 --> 00:47:41.125]  Exactly how to establish that.
[00:47:41.505 --> 00:47:44.148]  Well, the problem is... You would know more about that than I would.
[00:47:44.348 --> 00:47:48.371]  Well, the problem is they tried to, again, appoint Henry Kissinger, and they called him independent.
[00:47:48.852 --> 00:47:53.575]  It was like appointing one of Janet Reno's deputies to investigate Waco and calling it independent.
[00:47:54.016 --> 00:47:55.157]  What would be independent?
[00:47:55.737 --> 00:48:04.004]  Maybe just randomly pick 20 engineers or something and then draft them for a committee and then make sure no one tried to intimidate the witnesses?
[00:48:04.024 --> 00:48:05.906]  I mean, maybe just a jury of the peers.
[00:48:07.006 --> 00:48:11.817]  What if we use like retired political foreign nationals?
[00:48:12.298 --> 00:48:15.406]  What if we use experts that don't have any ties whatsoever
[00:48:16.027 --> 00:48:16.928]  To this administration.
[00:48:17.428 --> 00:48:22.711]  Well, Michael Meacher, a number three in the Blair government, says that he believes the government may be behind it.
[00:48:23.091 --> 00:48:27.654]  And then we have Andres von Bulow, the former German defense minister, saying the same thing.
[00:48:28.134 --> 00:48:32.217]  And a bunch of other Russian and other foreign leaders are saying the same thing.
[00:48:32.497 --> 00:48:36.159]  Over 80% of the French public in major polls say our government did it.
[00:48:36.439 --> 00:48:39.661]  So, boy, if we got foreigners to do it, I think they'd come to the same conclusion we have.
[00:48:40.302 --> 00:48:40.782]  Right, right, right.
[00:48:40.802 --> 00:48:44.024]  But I'm just saying as far as people that don't have a stake or don't have an interest or don't,
[00:48:45.444 --> 00:48:46.725]  Oh, I agree with you.
[00:48:46.825 --> 00:48:47.306]  I agree with you.
[00:48:47.326 --> 00:48:49.307]  I'm just saying that they would come to the same conclusion.
[00:48:49.827 --> 00:48:50.168]  Yeah.
[00:48:51.148 --> 00:48:55.031]  Well, I guess in the court of public opinion, I would say that people aren't buying the official story.
[00:48:56.312 --> 00:48:56.912]  No, they're not.
[00:48:57.333 --> 00:48:57.793]  They're not.
[00:48:57.873 --> 00:49:00.174]  And I would place myself in that court.
[00:49:01.796 --> 00:49:04.377]  But, you know, so we've talked about Building 7, right?
[00:49:05.838 --> 00:49:09.321]  And that whole episode really smells a rat.
[00:49:10.782 --> 00:49:14.024]  But then you've got to sort of shift the focus to the Pentagon, right?
[00:49:15.592 --> 00:49:16.453]  Very suspicious.
[00:49:16.893 --> 00:49:18.534]  You know, are we coming up on a break?
[00:49:18.554 --> 00:49:20.295]  Should we come back to the Pentagon after the break?
[00:49:20.355 --> 00:49:24.637]  Yeah, let's do that after the break, but in the minute and a half or so we've got right now.
[00:49:24.657 --> 00:49:25.277]  Okay.
[00:49:25.297 --> 00:49:27.918]  What about PNAC, Project for a New American Century?
[00:49:28.359 --> 00:49:38.244]  Dick Cheney pens a piece in September 2000 titled Rebuilding America's Defenses, and he says we need a Pearl Harbor event to catalyze the American people.
[00:49:38.704 --> 00:49:39.245]  Yeah.
[00:49:39.305 --> 00:49:39.865]  Coincidence?
[00:49:39.885 --> 00:49:40.786]  We think not.
[00:49:40.826 --> 00:49:43.368]  No, I think, again, it's emblematic of the arrogance of this administration.
[00:49:43.388 --> 00:49:45.329]  Even just that video that was released yesterday,
[00:50:07.071 --> 00:50:14.876]  Last week, I believe, the interview prior to Katrina, and, I mean, it's not like there's, you know, again, supposition.
[00:50:15.057 --> 00:50:18.079]  It's documented quotes on videotape.
[00:50:19.059 --> 00:50:26.204]  And the White House comes out and says, well, you can't really look to that as any, you know, clear-cut example of what we knew.
[00:50:26.404 --> 00:50:28.565]  Yeah, FEMA said it's going to probably destroy the city.
[00:50:28.605 --> 00:50:30.106]  The Houston Chronicle reported that.
[00:50:30.487 --> 00:50:32.488]  Times-Picayune Unit reported everybody knew.
[00:50:32.508 --> 00:50:34.189]  And then Bush goes off on vacation.
[00:50:35.376 --> 00:50:35.596]  Yeah.
[00:50:35.996 --> 00:50:39.257]  No, again, it is a very arrogant administration.
[00:50:39.297 --> 00:50:40.997]  Well, what about them today?
[00:50:41.698 --> 00:50:45.338]  Mr. Sheen's saying that Iraq's better off and everything's going great.
[00:50:46.999 --> 00:50:47.739]  Yeah.
[00:50:48.219 --> 00:50:52.280]  I don't know that they're talking about the same Iraq that you and I are observing.
[00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:53.140]  I agree with you.
[00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:53.921]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:54.181 --> 00:50:55.021]  Amazing interview.
[00:50:55.081 --> 00:50:56.761]  The conclusion on the other side.
[00:51:01.784 --> 00:51:08.631]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.931 --> 00:51:10.313]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:10.493 --> 00:51:12.695]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:12.855 --> 00:51:14.937]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:15.218 --> 00:51:20.162]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:20.483 --> 00:51:24.527]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:24.767 --> 00:51:26.529]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:51:26.609 --> 00:51:37.257]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and findable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.417 --> 00:51:39.299]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:51:39.519 --> 00:51:43.362]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowars.

[00:54:01.441 --> 00:54:09.963]  Well, I talked to him during the break, and he has really been a champ, spending a whole hour of his precious time with us.
[00:54:09.983 --> 00:54:15.525]  He's going to leave us in just about four minutes, five minutes, and go work on his TV show.
[00:54:16.491 --> 00:54:19.692]  Today, two and a half men will be on tonight, 8 o'clock, CBS.
[00:54:20.712 --> 00:54:26.933]  But I was talking to him yesterday, and he talked about some of the folks there where he works, and a story that one of the crew told him.
[00:54:27.514 --> 00:54:29.654]  And it meshes with this article out of Knight Ritter today.
[00:54:29.714 --> 00:54:35.135]  Pentagon hired contractors to advise on collecting information on churches, mosques, and other U.S.
[00:54:35.175 --> 00:54:36.756]  sites spying on American citizens.
[00:54:36.796 --> 00:54:37.376]  Here's another one.
[00:54:37.736 --> 00:54:40.817]  Washington Post, advanced workers for Bush impersonated reporters.
[00:54:41.157 --> 00:54:45.778]  They're all over the place posing as reporters, spying on people, and advanced teams doing that.
[00:54:46.498 --> 00:54:48.900]  And they just do this all over the place.
[00:54:50.181 --> 00:54:51.561]  Charlie, your take on that?
[00:54:52.562 --> 00:54:55.744]  Well, there's a young guy, this young kid at work.
[00:54:55.804 --> 00:54:59.907]  He's from Nigeria, and he's in the production department.
[00:55:02.028 --> 00:55:04.910]  And he sort of overheard a conversation.
[00:55:04.930 --> 00:55:07.031]  I was talking about the events of 9-11 and this and that.
[00:55:07.051 --> 00:55:12.615]  And he said, you know, it was interesting because at the time, he was attending George Washington University in downtown D.C.,
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:30.117]  And he said the day after the event that federal teams of what they were described as trauma counselors came to his school, came to his college, came into the classrooms, and basically told them, you're all in shock.
[00:55:30.898 --> 00:55:34.842]  What we've seen is unlike anything we've ever witnessed.
[00:55:35.322 --> 00:55:36.003]  We understand...
[00:55:36.647 --> 00:55:43.173]  That in moments like this, that your memory, your eyes will play tricks on you in the future.
[00:55:43.713 --> 00:55:45.315]  So if anybody's questioning...
[00:55:47.595 --> 00:55:50.296]  What we're telling you has happened.
[00:55:51.456 --> 00:55:55.097]  Do not believe what you think you know about yesterday.
[00:55:55.397 --> 00:56:01.158]  Basically telling them that here's the story, follow it, have a good day.
[00:56:01.178 --> 00:56:03.979]  I have questions about the Pentagon, so do you.
[00:56:04.039 --> 00:56:07.839]  Why did they grab hundreds of surveillance camera tapes and declare national security?
[00:56:07.859 --> 00:56:10.420]  Why won't they just show us the footage of what happened?
[00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:13.921]  Show us this incredible maneuvering.
[00:56:14.501 --> 00:56:15.482]  Just show it to us.
[00:56:16.182 --> 00:56:20.843]  Just show us, you know, how this particular plane pulled off these maneuvers.
[00:56:20.984 --> 00:56:21.984]  What was it?
[00:56:22.084 --> 00:56:31.467]  A 270-degree turn at 500 miles an hour, descending 7,000 feet in two and a half minutes, skimming across the treetops the last 500 meters.
[00:56:31.727 --> 00:56:33.288]  You can't hold it off the ground.
[00:56:33.308 --> 00:56:41.131]  I have talked to pilots who've flown that very aircraft, that very type, and they say that at 500 and something miles an hour, you cannot fly that low to the ground.
[00:56:41.858 --> 00:56:51.720]  Yeah, no, if that happened and there are that many cameras on it, you know, I understand in the interest of national security that maybe not release the Pentagon cameras, but what about the Sheraton?
[00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:53.100]  What about the gas station?
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:55.900]  What about the Department of Transportation freeway cam?
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:59.361]  What about all these shots that had this thing perfectly documented?
[00:57:00.241 --> 00:57:05.602]  Instead, they put out five frames that they claim not to have authorized, correct?
[00:57:06.682 --> 00:57:08.383]  And it doesn't look like a passenger liner.
[00:57:08.403 --> 00:57:10.943]  It looks like some type of small white aircraft or drone.
[00:57:11.747 --> 00:57:13.428]  It's really suspicious.
[00:57:13.608 --> 00:57:21.313]  And then, if you look in the lower left-hand corner at the date stamp, it's September 12th.
[00:57:25.676 --> 00:57:27.618]  As usual, nothing they say fits.
[00:57:27.758 --> 00:57:29.079]  Nothing at any point.
[00:57:29.199 --> 00:57:31.160]  Everything they say turns out to be a fraud.
[00:57:32.125 --> 00:57:43.593]  Yeah, but the whole thing about, well, the plane disintegrated and this and that, I don't know what that jet is going to do into a reinforced limestone facade.
[00:57:43.673 --> 00:57:46.134]  But it did disappear like the Wicked Witch from Waterheader.
[00:57:46.214 --> 00:57:48.015]  It just all went into a 14-foot hole.
[00:57:48.896 --> 00:57:49.456]  Exactly.
[00:57:50.017 --> 00:57:54.800]  But this whole thing about, even if you just take the one statement about the wings folding up,
[00:57:55.419 --> 00:58:01.205]  It seems like at that impact velocity, everything is still going the same speed.
[00:58:01.385 --> 00:58:01.906]  You know what?
[00:58:02.826 --> 00:58:12.576]  Mr. Sheen, Charlie Sheen, we've got to get you back up in the near future, and of course you and I are going to be working on something in the near future, and I'm really honored to be collaborating with you, and I want to thank you for joining us.
[00:58:12.616 --> 00:58:14.238]  Closing comments in the last 30 seconds.
[00:58:15.099 --> 00:58:15.880]  Last 30 seconds.
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:17.121]  It is up to us.
[00:58:17.828 --> 00:58:19.509]  To reveal the truth.
[00:58:19.569 --> 00:58:22.390]  It is up to us because we owe it to the families.
[00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:23.591]  We owe it to the victims.
[00:58:23.651 --> 00:58:32.616]  We owe it to everybody whose life was drastically altered horrifically that day and forever.
[00:58:32.776 --> 00:58:36.097]  We owe it to them to uncover what happened.
[00:58:36.198 --> 00:58:36.658]  Yes, sir.
[00:58:36.758 --> 00:58:37.218]  Godspeed.
[00:58:37.238 --> 00:58:38.059]  You've got a lot of courage.
[00:58:38.079 --> 00:58:38.779]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:58:41.266 --> 00:58:46.111]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:46.151 --> 00:58:46.611]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.772 --> 00:58:47.552]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.753 --> 00:58:53.278]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:53.678 --> 00:58:55.220]  You want answers?
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:57.002]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.786 --> 00:59:09.430]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:14.074]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.255 --> 00:59:21.441]  Well, we just had one of the icons of Hollywood, Charlie Sheen, from an icon family, join us for the last hour.
[00:59:21.941 --> 00:59:22.662]  He wanted to stay.
[00:59:22.682 --> 00:59:23.183]  He had to go.
[00:59:23.223 --> 00:59:27.206]  He has to go shoot on the set for the next episode of Two and a Half Men.
[00:59:27.567 --> 00:59:29.569]  It's raining, so he'll probably get there late anyways.
[00:59:29.609 --> 00:59:30.730]  He's getting there late to do this interview.
[00:59:32.339 --> 00:59:37.182]  So we're going to have him back on in the near future, and we are working on some really neat stuff that I'm not going to talk about now.
[00:59:38.183 --> 00:59:43.886]  But just to finish up, he wanted to make the point when he ran out of time that the wings would have folded up.
[00:59:44.486 --> 00:59:45.567]  I mean, they claim they folded up.
[00:59:45.627 --> 00:59:50.670]  If they would have folded up, you would have seen the wreckage there or it would have left marks on the facade of the building.
[00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:51.690]  It just doesn't make sense.
[00:59:51.711 --> 00:59:54.292]  And that's what everybody else has said about the Pentagon.
[00:59:54.312 --> 00:59:56.854]  So we're very honored to have Mr. Sheen.
[00:59:56.894 --> 00:59:57.514]  I'm going to take a break.
[00:59:58.211 --> 00:59:58.911]  Where you were sleeping...
[01:00:24.284 --> 01:00:48.659]  They came and took it all away The lanes and the meadows The places where you used to play It was an inside job By the well-connected Your little protest
[01:00:52.273 --> 01:00:55.376]  We're good to go.
[01:01:24.423 --> 01:01:43.696]  This little island disappears While you are looking the other way They'll take your right to own your own ideas And it's an insane job
[01:01:45.025 --> 01:01:49.306]  We're good to go.
[01:01:49.526 --> 01:01:52.487]  We're good to go.
[01:02:20.469 --> 01:02:20.789]  We're good to go.
[01:02:53.852 --> 01:03:13.588]  I know what I've done wrong I am acquainted with the night I know how hard it is To always walk out in the night And it's an inside job To learn about forgiving It's an inside job
[01:03:15.472 --> 01:03:18.916]  We're good to go.
[01:03:54.755 --> 01:03:57.616]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.857 --> 01:03:58.557]  Hello, my friends.
[01:03:58.657 --> 01:03:59.437]  Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.778 --> 01:04:04.460]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:11.544]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:11.864 --> 01:04:13.826]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:14.046 --> 01:04:16.888]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.988 --> 01:04:21.631]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.832 --> 01:04:26.235]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.495 --> 01:04:33.720]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:33.961 --> 01:04:36.382]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[01:05:13.450 --> 01:05:13.850]  We're good to go.

[01:05:54.181 --> 01:05:56.503]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:05:56.763 --> 01:05:58.785]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:05:58.945 --> 01:06:05.992]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[01:06:06.272 --> 01:06:14.840]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:19.842]  Now for the first time, Calvin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[01:06:20.002 --> 01:06:24.024]  That's great news because Calvin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients.
[01:06:24.224 --> 01:06:26.665]  It's earth-friendly and completely environmentally safe.
[01:06:26.846 --> 01:06:31.188]  So if you want yesterday's values today for good old-fashioned pure soap, call 1-800-340-7091.

[01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:52.223]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[01:06:53.544 --> 01:06:59.088]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:07.555 --> 01:07:08.655]  Well, you know what happened?
[01:07:09.376 --> 01:07:19.119]  Our AM and FM listeners that listen off of the satellites were able to hear the whole Charlie Sheen interview.
[01:07:19.699 --> 01:07:31.563]  But 15 minutes towards the end of the interview, about 45 after last hour, all of the streams, and I mean there are a bunch of streams, I've got servers, the network has servers, it just maxed out and crashed.
[01:07:31.623 --> 01:07:36.285]  So what I'm going to do is, that interview is so important as more and more prominent people go public,
[01:07:37.845 --> 01:07:39.888]  I'm just going to air that interview again next hour.
[01:07:40.088 --> 01:07:42.931]  We're getting a lot of requests and phones are ringing off the hook of the network.
[01:07:43.752 --> 01:07:51.761]  There are even some stations, believe it or not, that get these high quality digital internet feeds from us that are, I don't know, 100 and something bit or 56k.
[01:07:51.841 --> 01:07:53.223]  I forget what it is.
[01:07:53.243 --> 01:07:55.726]  We even have affiliates that take it off the web.
[01:07:55.746 --> 01:07:57.368]  They're on dedicated streams and those even...
[01:07:58.047 --> 01:08:01.110]  Went down because they were on the very servers that started smoking.
[01:08:01.711 --> 01:08:06.876]  So I apologize about you guys, I guess, losing roughly ten minutes of broadcast, of program.
[01:08:07.396 --> 01:08:10.039]  So we will re-air that coming up in the third hour.
[01:08:10.279 --> 01:08:10.959]  I think it's worth it.
[01:08:10.999 --> 01:08:12.461]  Isn't that what you want, listeners?
[01:08:13.041 --> 01:08:16.064]  If some of the listeners missed something, we should just go ahead and air it again.
[01:08:16.445 --> 01:08:18.967]  In this hour, we'll cover all the news and take your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:08:23.246 --> 01:08:23.767]  We're good to go.
[01:08:23.787 --> 01:08:24.047]  I think?
[01:08:47.381 --> 01:08:47.721]  We're good to go.
[01:08:47.741 --> 01:08:47.881]  I think?
[01:09:11.615 --> 01:09:16.716]  Hollywood people, some of the biggest names, who listen routinely.
[01:09:16.916 --> 01:09:23.477]  I mean, that listen every week that I'm in contact with, that I talk to, but that are afraid to go public.
[01:09:24.158 --> 01:09:25.798]  Well, not Charlie Sheen.
[01:09:26.698 --> 01:09:30.919]  He is putting a lot on the line to come out and do that.
[01:09:30.939 --> 01:09:36.820]  I mean, he's already been in the tabloids before for his taste in women and other things, but
[01:09:37.458 --> 01:09:42.764]  Hell, everybody knows the president's a lot wilder than Charlie Sheen, so I don't want to get any neocon emails talking bad about him.
[01:09:44.185 --> 01:09:47.789]  Boy, look at the beam in George Bush's eye, your emperor, your god.
[01:09:48.089 --> 01:09:54.376]  But he's a great guy, and again, of all the Hollywood people I've talked to, he is the most informed.
[01:09:54.516 --> 01:09:57.559]  And I mean, I've talked to some that just live this stuff constantly.
[01:09:58.288 --> 01:09:59.869]  And he confirmed what I already knew.
[01:09:59.889 --> 01:10:04.572]  In Hollywood right now, that's why you are actually seeing movies come out that are anti-New World Order.
[01:10:04.973 --> 01:10:13.078]  The establishment's having a lot of trouble trying to keep all their producers and people in line because they all want to talk about this.
[01:10:13.138 --> 01:10:13.719]  I mean, why not?
[01:10:13.779 --> 01:10:14.980]  The truth is dynamic.
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:15.700]  It's amazing.
[01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:16.521]  It's invigorating.
[01:10:16.581 --> 01:10:17.181]  It's scary.
[01:10:17.782 --> 01:10:19.103]  And it's what people want to talk about.
[01:10:19.143 --> 01:10:20.143]  It's what they want to get into.
[01:10:20.223 --> 01:10:22.365]  So we had Charlie Sheen on with us, sticking his toe...
[01:10:23.288 --> 01:10:33.275]  In the water today, here on the Alex Jones Show, where we cover real talk radio, real issues of real significance that actually affect you and your family.
[01:10:35.657 --> 01:10:41.181]  And I am just, again, blown away by the fact that top Japanese CEOs
[01:10:44.821 --> 01:10:56.324]  Listen to the radio show and watch my films that the UN Security Council's ordered them, that we've sent orders to the National Security Council in this government, that the Pentagon orders my videos.
[01:10:56.364 --> 01:11:02.145]  I mean, I'm not just talking about visitors to the website, because you can go, oh, look, 5% of our traffic's government.
[01:11:02.205 --> 01:11:06.587]  Oh, look, NSA, DEA, Defense Intelligence.
[01:11:07.127 --> 01:11:11.988]  I mean, any big site's going to have that, because there's employees there late at night, and a lot of that's just traffic.
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:17.141]  It's patriots or people following a link.
[01:11:17.161 --> 01:11:19.202]  A lot of folks go, look, I've got traffic on my website.
[01:11:19.242 --> 01:11:20.802]  That means the government's looking at me.
[01:11:20.862 --> 01:11:22.062]  Most of the time that is not the case.
[01:11:23.023 --> 01:11:37.326]  No, no, but when the heads of federal agencies are ordering the videos, when big international banking associations in Switzerland, and then, oh, the other day, I won't say names, I don't,
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:44.002]  It's kind of like the guy in school who goes out and dates the girls and keeps his mouth shut and the girls start, really, his name starts getting around.
[01:11:44.122 --> 01:11:44.582]  I'm sorry.
[01:11:44.822 --> 01:11:49.523]  No, I mean, seriously, that's a terrible analogy, but I keep my mouth shut.
[01:11:49.863 --> 01:12:04.527]  But to sit there and to see orders that come in from international banking associations based in Europe, places like Austria, to have, I mean, to be contacted, to know that top banks
[01:12:05.577 --> 01:12:05.978]  Several.
[01:12:06.478 --> 01:12:10.361]  But in one case, one top CEO of a Japanese company.
[01:12:11.842 --> 01:12:15.725]  And they have staff checking out what I'm saying and cross-referencing and listening.
[01:12:16.025 --> 01:12:17.787]  Because they know it's real, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:17.847 --> 01:12:19.788]  And don't ask me why they all tune into this show.
[01:12:22.390 --> 01:12:23.391]  I mean, I'm bombastic.
[01:12:23.431 --> 01:12:24.592]  I've got my problems.
[01:12:24.852 --> 01:12:28.355]  And I frankly sometimes don't even like to listen to my own shows.
[01:12:28.375 --> 01:12:29.596]  Sometimes I listen and I go, that's great radio.
[01:12:29.616 --> 01:12:32.058]  Other times I listen and I go, I sound like a babbling monkey.
[01:12:32.518 --> 01:12:33.879]  A jittering ape.
[01:12:35.138 --> 01:12:37.160]  But I think I telegraph the truth to people.
[01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:37.621]  People know.
[01:12:37.661 --> 01:12:40.484]  I mean, I'm in this for survival.
[01:12:41.005 --> 01:12:42.427]  I'm in this for the right reasons.
[01:12:42.687 --> 01:12:43.969]  And people have instincts.
[01:12:43.989 --> 01:12:50.316]  And people's instincts are getting honed because things are getting so dangerous in the world that it has a way of getting people's heads screwed on straight.
[01:12:50.837 --> 01:12:51.438]  And folks...
[01:12:52.566 --> 01:12:56.287]  See the COINTELPRO operatives, the DISINFO operatives, from a mile away.
[01:12:56.307 --> 01:13:01.308]  And that's why you are losers, some of you out there, that attack the show and do the things you do.
[01:13:01.348 --> 01:13:03.229]  And why no one will ever have truck with you.
[01:13:03.549 --> 01:13:06.669]  No one will ever suck with you or give you sucker.
[01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:14.311]  No one wants to be around you because you're evil, grasping, dark side individuals.
[01:13:15.231 --> 01:13:17.252]  And you're going to lose, believe me.
[01:13:20.129 --> 01:13:23.451]  I snuck out last night after work and saw V for Vendetta.
[01:13:23.491 --> 01:13:24.072]  My wife hears it.
[01:13:24.092 --> 01:13:24.592]  She's going to get mad.
[01:13:24.612 --> 01:13:25.533]  She wanted me to take her to it.
[01:13:27.935 --> 01:13:30.136]  But I'm going to be caught by my own mouth.
[01:13:30.536 --> 01:13:34.459]  But I snuck off and watched it last night, and it was good.
[01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:39.743]  People said it was Illuminati, and I'd read some of the different synopses that were out there about it.
[01:13:40.343 --> 01:13:42.365]  Those were dishonest.
[01:13:42.765 --> 01:13:44.286]  I have questions about the Matrix.
[01:13:44.847 --> 01:13:48.409]  I have questions about some of the Illuminati things that are in it, especially in the third one.
[01:13:51.252 --> 01:13:51.592]  What is it?
[01:13:52.072 --> 01:13:54.093]  Matrix Revolutions or Revelations?
[01:13:54.133 --> 01:13:54.533]  I forget.
[01:13:56.793 --> 01:14:01.114]  But the Wachowski brothers with V for Vendetta, I know why the media is attacking it.
[01:14:01.134 --> 01:14:15.178]  I mean, it shows the government carrying out terror attacks with a bird flu type weapon to get martial law, to go after their political enemies, and to sell the pharmaceutical that is the cure for it.
[01:14:17.378 --> 01:14:19.439]  Which is what's happening in our real world.
[01:14:20.812 --> 01:14:26.236]  And in the film, of course, the government... Well, just go see it for yourself.
[01:14:26.256 --> 01:14:27.217]  There's a lot of other things in it.
[01:14:29.119 --> 01:14:33.622]  It should also scare you, though, because a lot of times we see in Hollywood what the New World War is actually going to do later.
[01:14:34.723 --> 01:14:38.106]  In some cases, the bad guys do it themselves, but in others, it's the opposite.
[01:14:39.067 --> 01:14:40.428]  But everybody knows they're in danger.
[01:14:40.568 --> 01:14:42.349]  Servants of the New World War know they're in danger.
[01:14:42.389 --> 01:14:44.491]  People who are big-time know they're in danger.
[01:14:44.511 --> 01:14:49.515]  And that's why they're finally jumping ship, finally getting off the fence in some cases...
[01:14:50.242 --> 01:15:06.865]  Now, those were just neutral, and joining the fight for humanity, joining the fight for liberty, joining the fight against dehumanization, because they know that this is bad for everybody, that the elite are psychopathic.
[01:15:06.905 --> 01:15:08.326]  I mean, why are the elite?
[01:15:08.686 --> 01:15:14.327]  There's an article here where different states are trying to pass laws banning cities and counties...
[01:15:15.226 --> 01:15:22.371]  And different farming associations from themselves banning the cross-species genetically engineered crops.
[01:15:23.752 --> 01:15:28.156]  You see, the limb balls of the world try to confuse this issue.
[01:15:30.197 --> 01:15:32.359]  They try to confuse the issue.
[01:15:33.766 --> 01:15:38.149]  And they try to say, oh, George Washington Carver, he engaged in genetic engineering.
[01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:49.398]  Yeah, he'd take one variety of peanut and cross it with five other peanuts and find out which one used less water, less soil, and a larger fruit inside the peanut shell.
[01:15:50.078 --> 01:15:52.780]  Now, that's just simple breeding, just like we've bred dogs.
[01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:57.204]  You're still working with the original canine genetics.
[01:15:57.264 --> 01:15:58.685]  That's what canine familiaris is.
[01:15:59.364 --> 01:16:09.319]  You take the, I guess, three different subspecies of wolf, and the different variants there is where you then get the different derivations of canine familiars.
[01:16:09.995 --> 01:16:11.276]  That is not cross species.
[01:16:11.316 --> 01:16:32.115]  When you stick spider genes in goats or tomato genes in pigs or human genes in pigs or jellyfish and cockroach and salamander genes in corn, and that's the kind of stuff that's in them, or you stick part of two different bacteria and three other plants from totally different species, not even the same genus or group, into it,
[01:16:33.155 --> 01:16:44.840]  Then you get really dangerous stuff that can give rise to super funguses, super bacteria, super viruses that can take over other whole plant species or animal species.
[01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:57.465]  And they're now admitting that most of the allergies, the explosion in allergies, people never had allergies that we're seeing, are because of all this genetically engineered pollen out there in the air that's got other plant and animal matter in it, and the body really sees it as a bacteria.
[01:16:59.950 --> 01:17:05.834]  And then they're using DU all over the planet, which their own handbooks admit will kill you, guaranteed.
[01:17:06.715 --> 01:17:08.696]  You're going to live a life of misery and then you're going to die.
[01:17:09.657 --> 01:17:13.559]  If you get just even small amounts of this and now it's in the air globally.
[01:17:15.921 --> 01:17:20.824]  And then they race to buy up the government and private testing centers to make sure no one can even release that data.
[01:17:21.889 --> 01:17:22.690]  Why are they doing that?
[01:17:22.770 --> 01:17:23.031]  Why?
[01:17:23.071 --> 01:17:24.213]  The elite could have taken Iraq.
[01:17:24.233 --> 01:17:26.235]  They could take over without using DU.
[01:17:26.295 --> 01:17:27.357]  They themselves breathe.
[01:17:27.437 --> 01:17:27.717]  Why?
[01:17:27.778 --> 01:17:28.999]  What's wrong with them?
[01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:30.341]  They're evil.
[01:17:31.343 --> 01:17:32.284]  They're malfunctioning.
[01:17:32.364 --> 01:17:33.486]  They love death.
[01:17:34.026 --> 01:17:36.250]  They are possessed with destructive tendencies.
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:59.492]  And these crooks, these big crime families, none of them will say no to each other, so they're all just racing each other to get new developments and new patents and new profits into corner and control industries, so there's no legitimate sane controls, and they're busy pulling you and your family over saying they want to search your car because 9-11 and America's in a new atmosphere because we're all in danger.
[01:18:00.213 --> 01:18:04.035]  You better not worry about planes blowing up or even A-bombs going off.
[01:18:04.335 --> 01:18:07.337]  That is nothing compared to the genetic engineering and the D.U.,
[01:18:08.592 --> 01:18:08.912]  It's nothing!
[01:18:08.932 --> 01:18:09.172]  It's nothing!
[01:18:38.027 --> 01:18:41.111]  The equivalent of 44,000 A-bombs.
[01:18:43.033 --> 01:18:45.595]  A-bombs.
[01:18:46.376 --> 01:18:47.237]  And we're breathing it.
[01:18:48.639 --> 01:18:51.902]  The radiation detectors are ringing off the hook.
[01:18:53.584 --> 01:18:58.886]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[01:18:59.086 --> 01:19:01.167]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[01:19:01.408 --> 01:19:08.531]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:19:08.651 --> 01:19:20.176]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[01:19:20.496 --> 01:19:21.297]  We're good to go.
[01:19:50.299 --> 01:19:50.339]  888-803-4438
[01:20:09.762 --> 01:20:23.089]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:28.893]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:20:29.193 --> 01:20:35.076]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[01:20:45.376 --> 01:20:49.058]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[01:20:49.078 --> 01:20:57.362]  1-800-686-2237 Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:20:57.942 --> 01:20:59.683]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:21:00.851 --> 01:21:08.743]  The best kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:21:08.963 --> 01:21:11.607]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed, Inc.'
[01:21:11.587 --> 01:21:13.009]  's patented methodology.
[01:21:13.170 --> 01:21:16.515]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation,
[01:21:16.915 --> 01:21:17.516]  We're good to go.
[01:21:17.536 --> 01:21:17.796]  I think?
[01:21:33.969 --> 01:21:37.632]  Or visit www.lasemedinc.com.
[01:21:37.913 --> 01:21:43.197]  That's www.lasemedinc.com.

[01:21:53.263 --> 01:21:55.523]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:55.724 --> 01:22:06.186]  Did you know the President Kennedy signed into law State Department Publication 7277 entitled the United States Program for Complete and General Disarmament in a Peaceful World?
[01:22:06.266 --> 01:22:11.467]  This would disarm America and turn all of our armed forces over to the United Nations organization.
[01:22:12.207 --> 01:22:16.668]  Citizens would be required to turn in their guns guaranteed to them by the Second Amendment.
[01:22:17.373 --> 01:22:23.040]  The head of the United Nations forces that would control all arms would always be a communist by agreement.
[01:22:23.817 --> 01:22:31.821]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:22:32.101 --> 01:22:33.622]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[01:22:33.642 --> 01:22:33.902]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:22:33.922 --> 01:22:34.162]  Call now.
[01:22:34.202 --> 01:22:39.865]  Operators are standing by to receive your call for a free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:22:55.777 --> 01:23:01.842]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:23:02.443 --> 01:23:05.446]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:08.108 --> 01:23:12.472]  Sure enough, you've been requesting it on instant messenger and emails and phone calls.
[01:23:12.592 --> 01:23:19.558]  We want to hear of the interview again because some of the Internet listeners, well, all the Internet listeners got knocked off because it maxed out the servers and we can...
[01:23:20.618 --> 01:23:23.539]  We could have tens of thousands listen, so pretty serious.
[01:23:23.919 --> 01:23:25.600]  Just on the net, which is a small part of our audience.
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:35.323]  I know we've got Johnny and many others that are holding, but John Connor of the Resistance Manifesto has done a lot of great work out there exposing the New World Order.
[01:23:35.623 --> 01:23:36.384]  He just called in.
[01:23:36.404 --> 01:23:38.224]  Well, he called in on the studio line.
[01:23:38.244 --> 01:23:39.125]  I'm not supposed to do that.
[01:23:39.145 --> 01:23:39.685]  I have to give him a...
[01:23:41.197 --> 01:23:42.338]  Put him in the timeout for that.
[01:23:42.958 --> 01:23:44.219]  But, John, good to hear from you.
[01:23:44.239 --> 01:23:44.859]  What's on your mind?
[01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:47.201]  Alex, I just want to touch on a few points.
[01:23:47.221 --> 01:23:51.623]  Since you mentioned V for Dev and Dead, I'm going to be posting a review here in about five minutes.
[01:23:52.063 --> 01:23:56.026]  Well, let me ask you a question of what you thought of the Sheen interview.
[01:23:56.046 --> 01:23:58.047]  Oh, absolutely fantastic.
[01:23:58.107 --> 01:24:01.569]  I'm sending out emails letting everybody know so they can tune into the rebroadcast.
[01:24:02.034 --> 01:24:03.075]  I think it's fantastic.
[01:24:03.115 --> 01:24:09.440]  I hope that Charlie Sheen just stands up and charges straight forward with all of his contacts to get this information out, Alex.
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:10.961]  Congratulations on that interview.
[01:24:11.921 --> 01:24:15.324]  Well, I'm not going to say what he's planning to do, but it's exciting.
[01:24:16.345 --> 01:24:19.287]  Well, listen, I just have a few points I want to touch on for Vendetta.
[01:24:19.307 --> 01:24:21.929]  Sorry for calling on the studio line, but I feel it's fairly important.
[01:24:21.949 --> 01:24:22.609]  I was teasing you.
[01:24:22.629 --> 01:24:23.190]  What's on your mind?
[01:24:23.675 --> 01:24:33.166]  Well, I just want to say, for those who haven't seen it, be careful for the pro-homosexual and anti-Christian messages which are blatantly slipped into the storyline.
[01:24:33.186 --> 01:24:33.887]  Oh, you're right.
[01:24:33.907 --> 01:24:34.228]  You're right.
[01:24:34.248 --> 01:24:35.409]  In fact, I attended a writer review.
[01:24:35.449 --> 01:24:36.571]  There is some of that in there.
[01:24:36.591 --> 01:24:39.274]  I meant where they're claiming it's pro-terrorist.
[01:24:40.375 --> 01:24:42.698]  I meant the message of showing the government's behind the terror.
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:44.021]  Well, yeah.
[01:24:44.181 --> 01:24:47.343]  But it is a right-wing government, and that's because the liberals can't figure it out.
[01:24:47.363 --> 01:24:54.689]  The liberals look at Bush and believe that he's really a Christian, and so they think that's what tyranny is, and I've talked about how that's done on purpose.
[01:24:55.710 --> 01:24:56.810]  There are a few points.
[01:24:57.651 --> 01:25:03.275]  The character V was the victim of an MKUltra-type experiment, which in a sense created him.
[01:25:03.656 --> 01:25:10.401]  The government did cause the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people to cause a police state and a pretext for their fascist regime.
[01:25:10.681 --> 01:25:12.002]  And to sell the pharmaceuticals.
[01:25:12.754 --> 01:25:24.618]  Yes, and I think it's very dangerous that this government, although they're not using the label Christian, it's very clear that it is a Christian fascist government with the pro-homosexual messages.
[01:25:24.658 --> 01:25:26.639]  But it shows that they're not really Christians.
[01:25:28.059 --> 01:25:28.439]  Correct.
[01:25:28.499 --> 01:25:36.762]  They are a perverted sect of the Christianity, which is what most of the Christians... Well, it shows them all partying and sex and drugs.
[01:25:36.782 --> 01:25:42.104]  It clearly shows the Catholic bishop, I mean, clearly not a Christian.
[01:25:42.978 --> 01:25:43.178]  Sure.
[01:25:43.258 --> 01:25:58.432]  I just wonder, even though this is a great tool for addressing issues for our constitutional freedoms and issues of privacy, I do question the motives of the film's producers as to glorifying guy folks and seeming to plant the idea...
[01:25:58.892 --> 01:26:13.362]  That what he was going to do was a good thing back in 1605 on November 5th when humanists proved... Well, I wasn't really an expert on that, and now I've researched some of the gunpowder plot, and a lot of evidence shows that it was another stage deal where the British just grabbed their enemies, claiming they were going to blow something up, and it wasn't true.
[01:26:13.983 --> 01:26:16.745]  Well, Alex, you'll be the one to uncover that and get to the truth.
[01:26:16.905 --> 01:26:25.591]  Well, no, that's in a lot of mainstream histories, that it was just a big setup and that they had provocateurs in there trying to stir people up to do it.
[01:26:26.798 --> 01:26:27.679]  Hey, that's fantastic.
[01:26:27.719 --> 01:26:29.340]  I think somebody should post an article on that.
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:39.426]  But I just wanted to express my disgust for the pro-homosexual and the anti-Christian message, and I really just think that we need to take this... Well, you know, the cross they use is the double cross.
[01:26:39.466 --> 01:26:42.348]  It's actually the Knights Templar Illuminati cross.
[01:26:42.388 --> 01:26:43.429]  It's a double red cross.
[01:26:43.729 --> 01:26:57.682]  Yeah, but they do, in the film, ban the Koran, and the television preacher does have a book which remains unnamed, but obviously it's a Christian Bible, so there is some Christian bashing in the subtitle.
[01:26:57.702 --> 01:26:58.162]  I agree with you.
[01:26:58.683 --> 01:26:59.063]  You know what?
[01:26:59.083 --> 01:26:59.483]  You're right.
[01:27:00.785 --> 01:27:03.167]  I was delirious and tired last night when I watched it to begin with, so...
[01:27:03.797 --> 01:27:12.180]  Yeah, well, just wanted to touch on those points, and I just fear that they're going to hope that this sparks some MKUltra-type Timothy McVadick, too.
[01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:13.260]  Well, look, I've said this.
[01:27:13.540 --> 01:27:14.820]  Listen, I've said this already.
[01:27:15.561 --> 01:27:23.103]  Clearly, they're planning to have Bush demonize conservatives and then bring in a, quote, liberal cow revolution that'll just continue with the Patriot Act and all the rest of it.
[01:27:23.183 --> 01:27:24.644]  Surely, that's being set up.
[01:27:25.644 --> 01:27:28.365]  Yep, so I just want to throw these red flags to the food.
[01:27:28.425 --> 01:27:30.565]  It's a fantastic tool for awakening people.
[01:27:30.665 --> 01:27:31.446]  Alex, got to run.
[01:27:31.506 --> 01:27:32.266]  Thanks for the call.
[01:27:33.346 --> 01:27:33.726]  You bet.
[01:27:33.907 --> 01:27:35.408]  Thank you for the call.
[01:27:35.468 --> 01:27:37.910]  Let's go ahead and talk to Johnny in Texas.
[01:27:37.930 --> 01:27:38.851]  Johnny, go ahead.
[01:27:38.871 --> 01:27:39.411]  We'll hold you over.
[01:27:39.431 --> 01:27:39.832]  Go ahead.
[01:27:40.192 --> 01:27:40.933]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:27:41.073 --> 01:27:41.793]  Good afternoon.
[01:27:43.575 --> 01:27:44.556]  I've enjoyed your show.
[01:27:44.576 --> 01:27:45.737]  It's a little bit off topic.
[01:27:45.937 --> 01:27:49.780]  I've enjoyed your show on Austin Access for well over a year now.
[01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:55.305]  I turned on the other day to watch it, and it wasn't there.
[01:27:55.485 --> 01:27:59.448]  It had been replaced by the City of Lakeway Bulletin Board.
[01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:01.490]  So this entire area...
[01:28:02.051 --> 01:28:10.058]  In Apache Shores, which is just outside of Lakeway, this entire area used to get your show.
[01:28:10.438 --> 01:28:14.822]  You and Jeff Davis and everybody else, the free speech channel was there.
[01:28:14.842 --> 01:28:15.703]  It was available.
[01:28:16.063 --> 01:28:16.964]  Now it's not.
[01:28:17.064 --> 01:28:18.185]  It's been taken away.
[01:28:18.225 --> 01:28:19.386]  Do you know anything about this?
[01:28:20.367 --> 01:28:20.888]  Yeah, the...
[01:28:21.773 --> 01:28:29.699]  A lot of cities carried the Access outside Austin, so we were able to reach over potentially millions, and all around us, they're shutting off the show.
[01:28:30.259 --> 01:28:30.740]  So stay there.
[01:28:30.780 --> 01:28:31.880]  Tell me more about it when we get back.
[01:28:32.341 --> 01:28:33.942]  Yeah, I mean, we started out on Access TV.
[01:28:34.022 --> 01:28:34.783]  I still do it every week.
[01:28:34.823 --> 01:28:35.583]  It's very effective.
[01:28:35.603 --> 01:28:38.145]  They're shutting it down all over the country.
[01:28:38.165 --> 01:28:38.625]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.789 --> 01:28:44.690]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.190 --> 01:28:46.791]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.692 --> 01:28:50.394]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.150 --> 01:29:01.012]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[01:29:01.172 --> 01:29:14.096]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[01:29:14.276 --> 01:29:16.057]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[01:29:16.237 --> 01:29:16.797]  We're good to go.
[01:29:35.470 --> 01:29:35.850]  Call 888-203-6633 today!
[01:29:54.204 --> 01:30:00.427]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:30:00.587 --> 01:30:06.750]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:30:07.030 --> 01:30:15.474]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:30:15.715 --> 01:30:22.718]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:30:23.038 --> 01:30:27.861]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:30:28.081 --> 01:30:33.485]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:30:33.825 --> 01:30:36.907]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:30:37.228 --> 01:30:45.193]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:45.233 --> 01:30:45.813]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:54.259 --> 01:30:57.580]  And now a word from Dr. Patricia Margaitis from Stem Enhance.
[01:30:58.020 --> 01:31:02.182]  I want to first thank the wonderful GCN listeners for supporting Stem Enhance.
[01:31:02.702 --> 01:31:10.085]  Now know that your own stem cells are your body's maintenance group, and Stem Enhance makes sure that more of them show up for work every day.
[01:31:10.509 --> 01:31:14.510]  The truth is, the more stem cells you have in your bloodstream, the greater your health.
[01:31:14.890 --> 01:31:28.815]  If you believe there is something more for you, have a strong work ethic, and wish to participate in the monumental increase in the cause for natural health while gaining financial independence and monthly cash flow, then you are the right person.
[01:31:28.835 --> 01:31:32.096]  I personally invite you to join me as a distributor of Stem Enhance.
[01:31:32.518 --> 01:31:36.780]  I am committed to personally make sure you receive the tools needed to succeed.
[01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:40.061]  Remember, the first rule of success, you must show up.
[01:31:40.201 --> 01:31:42.722]  Call me, Dr. Patricia Margitis, at 860-567-7744.
[01:31:42.762 --> 01:31:44.002]  That number again, 860-567-7744.
[01:31:44.022 --> 01:31:45.963]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:31:45.983 --> 01:31:48.063]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:03.291 --> 01:32:05.133]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:32:07.394 --> 01:32:08.415]  I want to run through the news.
[01:32:08.475 --> 01:32:09.616]  It's all very important.
[01:32:11.738 --> 01:32:15.181]  So, let's move through your calls quickly so I can get back into the news.
[01:32:16.124 --> 01:32:30.268]  Johnny, I am aware of what you're discussing, and in the past, a few years ago, Time Warner cabled the access channels with the city and the county and the school TV channels showing all the meetings, and then three channels of citizens.
[01:32:30.768 --> 01:32:31.468]  Very popular.
[01:32:31.508 --> 01:32:32.528]  People would ask for it.
[01:32:33.069 --> 01:32:37.070]  But no, now other areas will just run bulletin board, which no one wants to see.
[01:32:37.170 --> 01:32:38.090]  Why would they do that?
[01:32:38.930 --> 01:32:40.091]  These are Time Warner systems.
[01:32:40.371 --> 01:32:44.512]  Time Warner is suing the city right now to shut down access TV in Austin.
[01:32:44.532 --> 01:32:45.192]  I mean, I've had to...
[01:32:45.982 --> 01:32:46.803]  We're good to go.
[01:33:10.616 --> 01:33:14.679]  But go ahead and finish up what you were saying about out there by Lake Travis getting shut off.
[01:33:15.039 --> 01:33:23.125]  Okay, now, I've been in this area for about eight years, and I maintain a place for my mother out there in Lakeway.
[01:33:23.705 --> 01:33:27.908]  Okay, my wife and I bought a place just outside of Lakeway in Apache Shores.
[01:33:28.309 --> 01:33:37.215]  Now, for all these previous eight years, in the city of Lakeway proper, you were not able to get Austin Access free speech channels.
[01:33:37.597 --> 01:33:38.438]  Now you can't do that.
[01:33:54.051 --> 01:34:01.055]  Now, you come out of Lakeway, you come to Apache Shores, you turn it on, and it's just a... Well, have you called them and asked why that's happening?
[01:34:01.456 --> 01:34:02.456]  No, I don't know who to call.
[01:34:02.676 --> 01:34:03.337]  Who should I call?
[01:34:03.377 --> 01:34:03.817]  Time Warner?
[01:34:04.137 --> 01:34:06.499]  Yes, and then find out the specific little provider.
[01:34:06.519 --> 01:34:08.080]  They may be feeding another provider out there.
[01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:08.660]  Anything else, sir?
[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:11.602]  No, it's just that this is the mentality.
[01:34:11.642 --> 01:34:16.985]  Lakeway is full of what I like to refer to as Bush Nazis, and this is their mentality.
[01:34:17.561 --> 01:34:19.703]  Let's not let our kids see free speech.
[01:34:19.783 --> 01:34:22.305]  I mean, they protect, they isolate these kids in Lakeway.
[01:34:22.445 --> 01:34:23.586]  It's just ridiculous.
[01:34:23.746 --> 01:34:24.046]  Oh, really?
[01:34:24.086 --> 01:34:24.987]  I've talked to the police.
[01:34:25.047 --> 01:34:30.111]  I'm not saying all the rich people out there are bad, but it's some of the most corrupt, decadent kids, period.
[01:34:30.571 --> 01:34:31.371]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:34:31.472 --> 01:34:32.833]  And they've got a great police force.
[01:34:33.993 --> 01:34:36.776]  No, I actually know some of the people in the force.
[01:34:36.816 --> 01:34:38.437]  Yeah, actually, I do too, as well.
[01:34:38.497 --> 01:34:39.678]  I go fishing out there and stuff.
[01:34:40.118 --> 01:34:41.319]  Right, they're a great bunch of guys.
[01:34:42.039 --> 01:34:44.021]  They've had their hands tied for a long time, and
[01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:49.164]  And now they're finally getting some... My point is they're not really protecting those children from anything.
[01:34:50.345 --> 01:34:52.066]  All right, well, listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:34:52.607 --> 01:34:53.347]  That's bad to hear.
[01:34:53.387 --> 01:34:55.769]  But, I mean, they're shutting them down all over the country.
[01:34:55.829 --> 01:34:58.631]  Every week I see some major access station just shut down.
[01:34:59.252 --> 01:35:00.853]  It won't be there soon, so use it.
[01:35:00.973 --> 01:35:04.076]  That's why I say get my films and make copies of them.
[01:35:04.116 --> 01:35:05.497]  And I guess I don't say that enough because...
[01:35:06.235 --> 01:35:09.356]  Charlie Sheen listens to the show, and he says, hey, do I ever make copies of these?
[01:35:09.376 --> 01:35:10.816]  And I'm like, man, make all the copies you want.
[01:35:10.836 --> 01:35:11.376]  He's like, great.
[01:35:11.956 --> 01:35:14.816]  So in case any of you other people haven't heard, make copies.
[01:35:14.836 --> 01:35:16.297]  That's my whole point of making these.
[01:35:17.477 --> 01:35:19.917]  Let's talk to Dean in Tennessee.
[01:35:19.937 --> 01:35:20.677]  Dean, you're on the air.
[01:35:21.898 --> 01:35:22.678]  How you do, Alex?
[01:35:23.058 --> 01:35:28.159]  On the original broadcast on television, they talked about bombs going off at the Twin Towers.
[01:35:28.279 --> 01:35:28.759]  You remember?
[01:35:28.879 --> 01:35:29.999]  Have you seen any of those tapes?
[01:35:30.259 --> 01:35:32.199]  Yeah, I've got clips of them in some of my films.
[01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:34.720]  Okay, I wasn't sure.
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:35.160]  I have...
[01:35:36.050 --> 01:35:38.472]  I have a tape of the original one that I've just looked at.
[01:35:38.492 --> 01:35:40.053]  Do me a favor.
[01:35:40.153 --> 01:35:41.434]  Do me a favor in case I don't have it.
[01:35:41.474 --> 01:35:42.395]  Make yourself a copy.
[01:35:42.555 --> 01:35:44.336]  Make me an SP copy and mail it to me.
[01:35:44.356 --> 01:35:44.657]  Yes, sir.
[01:35:44.677 --> 01:35:47.619]  Okay, that's what I was calling you about because it's never been run.
[01:35:47.699 --> 01:35:49.180]  The first time I've run it was today.
[01:35:49.921 --> 01:35:50.841]  Well, do me a favor.
[01:35:50.862 --> 01:35:52.203]  There's a lot of tapes that I don't have.
[01:35:52.223 --> 01:35:54.084]  So send it to me.
[01:35:54.684 --> 01:35:56.226]  Okay, there's four hours of it.
[01:35:56.826 --> 01:35:57.166]  Please.
[01:35:57.847 --> 01:35:58.928]  Okay, it's on its way.
[01:35:58.968 --> 01:35:59.508]  Thank you, Al.
[01:35:59.928 --> 01:36:00.409]  Anything else?
[01:36:01.384 --> 01:36:04.266]  No, sir, just keep it up, and I'm just a lone wolf here in Tennessee.
[01:36:04.546 --> 01:36:05.966]  What did you think of the interview last hour?
[01:36:06.907 --> 01:36:07.667]  I didn't get to hear it.
[01:36:07.707 --> 01:36:08.508]  We got knocked off.
[01:36:09.548 --> 01:36:10.829]  All right, I appreciate your call.
[01:36:10.849 --> 01:36:11.749]  That's why we're going to re-air it.
[01:36:12.409 --> 01:36:13.610]  I hope it doesn't happen again.
[01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:15.351]  Let's talk to Rita and Mash.
[01:36:15.451 --> 01:36:16.231]  Rita, you're on the air.
[01:36:16.271 --> 01:36:16.671]  Go ahead.
[01:36:21.714 --> 01:36:22.754]  Okay, Rita's not there.
[01:36:23.274 --> 01:36:24.135]  Robert in Denver.
[01:36:24.195 --> 01:36:25.015]  Robert, you're on the air.
[01:36:25.055 --> 01:36:25.415]  Go ahead.
[01:36:26.436 --> 01:36:27.596]  Good morning, Alexander.
[01:36:27.637 --> 01:36:28.117]  How are you?
[01:36:28.217 --> 01:36:28.437]  Good.
[01:36:29.150 --> 01:36:29.370]  Good.
[01:36:29.511 --> 01:36:33.416]  You still have the same ruling that old-timers like me can only call in once a week.
[01:36:33.556 --> 01:36:34.617]  Is that still the same edict?
[01:36:35.819 --> 01:36:42.869]  Sir, all I said was is that people who call every day, I'd like them to try to limit it to once a week.
[01:36:43.289 --> 01:36:45.372]  Only because a lot of people complain they can never get through.
[01:36:45.945 --> 01:36:46.245]  I hear you.
[01:36:46.285 --> 01:36:46.665]  Fair enough.
[01:36:47.046 --> 01:36:48.586]  Hey, three quick questions.
[01:36:48.726 --> 01:36:54.269]  A year ago, we talked about Howard going to Sirius and the big money he was getting.
[01:36:54.329 --> 01:36:59.711]  He didn't think it would happen, but as you know, he went on the air in January this year, and he seems to be blowing and going, although I can't say anything.
[01:37:00.131 --> 01:37:01.192]  I want to know what you thought of that.
[01:37:01.212 --> 01:37:05.053]  Do you still think he's going to be on the air for the next three or four years, or how do you see that playing out?
[01:37:05.614 --> 01:37:07.354]  Are you saying I said I didn't think it would work?
[01:37:07.514 --> 01:37:08.835]  I think I said I thought it would work.
[01:37:09.655 --> 01:37:10.056]  Oh, okay.
[01:37:10.076 --> 01:37:11.156]  I thought you said it wouldn't.
[01:37:11.436 --> 01:37:13.677]  Well, I jabbered so fast, maybe you misunderstood me.
[01:37:13.757 --> 01:37:15.398]  I mean, no, he's made hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:37:16.041 --> 01:37:17.763]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:37:18.643 --> 01:37:24.648]  Two weeks ago, 12 pages of Denver Post, there was a survey done that showed Bush's approval rating was in the low 30s.
[01:37:25.089 --> 01:37:30.253]  The same survey said that 72% of the soldiers in Iraq said they should get out in a year.
[01:37:30.574 --> 01:37:31.795]  Did you see that survey?
[01:37:31.815 --> 01:37:32.896]  Well, that was the Zogby.
[01:37:32.936 --> 01:37:37.860]  The other was Le Pew Research Center, and they both show similar numbers.
[01:37:39.202 --> 01:37:43.243]  Some polls show him as low as 25%, a lot of them 27%, some 33%.
[01:37:43.283 --> 01:37:45.644]  The big CBS and U.S.
[01:37:45.864 --> 01:37:46.764]  CNN polls are showing 32%, 34%.
[01:37:47.304 --> 01:37:53.986]  And, yeah, meanwhile, Cheney and Bush are saying that the war is going great and everything is wonderful.
[01:37:55.186 --> 01:37:59.067]  But do you think that the part about the soldiers, 70%, saying we should get out is accurate?
[01:37:59.087 --> 01:37:59.767]  Do you agree with that?
[01:38:00.267 --> 01:38:03.068]  Oh, I think it's higher than that from the soldiers I've talked to.
[01:38:03.628 --> 01:38:03.968]  Really?
[01:38:04.008 --> 01:38:04.928]  They echo the same thing?
[01:38:05.555 --> 01:38:10.743]  Yeah, I mean, you've got some brainwashed soldiers that just think it's all wonderful, but most of them are pretty smart.
[01:38:10.783 --> 01:38:16.011]  I mean, you normally find that 70-plus percent of soldiers are on the right side of things, are good people.
[01:38:16.332 --> 01:38:20.699]  Most of them do join because they love this country and think they're fighting for this country in most cases.
[01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:24.182]  76% in the famous 29 Palm survey.
[01:38:24.222 --> 01:38:26.464]  Will you fire on Americans under PDD 25?
[01:38:27.686 --> 01:38:29.607]  76% said no.
[01:38:29.648 --> 01:38:33.371]  And then they've had other official surveys, and it's in the high 70s.
[01:38:33.451 --> 01:38:37.695]  So those numbers mesh with 70-plus percent are good people.
[01:38:38.376 --> 01:38:38.816]  Well, good.
[01:38:38.856 --> 01:38:40.118]  The others are dumb as dirt.
[01:38:41.099 --> 01:38:43.461]  And, you know, that's better numbers you find in the general public.
[01:38:44.962 --> 01:38:45.683]  You're probably right.
[01:38:45.703 --> 01:38:46.424]  I'm glad to hear that.
[01:38:46.765 --> 01:38:48.067]  Hey, one last quick thing.
[01:38:48.147 --> 01:38:51.912]  I was listening to Stan Monteith a week or so ago, and I forget who he was talking to.
[01:38:52.233 --> 01:38:55.878]  The subject of war came up in Iraq and what's going to happen in Iran and so forth.
[01:38:56.394 --> 01:39:02.299]  And Dr. Monti made the comment that he thought that the United States is still a superpower.
[01:39:02.339 --> 01:39:03.780]  We could pretty much crush anybody.
[01:39:04.521 --> 01:39:09.505]  I think two countries that would give us a run for our money in a straight-up war would definitely be China and Russia.
[01:39:09.866 --> 01:39:10.826]  What's your feelings on that?
[01:39:11.067 --> 01:39:12.748]  Well, I'll let you go and answer that.
[01:39:12.808 --> 01:39:16.711]  The problem is the globalists own and control predominantly Russia and China.
[01:39:16.732 --> 01:39:17.192]  So it's like...
[01:39:17.950 --> 01:39:20.512]  A triple Siamese twin, the U.S., Russia, China.
[01:39:20.932 --> 01:39:25.114]  So if you start stabbing the twin next to you, you're stabbing your own blood supply.
[01:39:25.495 --> 01:39:26.535]  You're stabbing yourself.
[01:39:27.976 --> 01:39:42.545]  So, according to the Pentagon's new map and the futurist war planners that they really respond to and they support and they celebrate, China and Russia are buddies and are going to help police America and we're going to help police them.
[01:39:42.585 --> 01:39:43.205]  That's official.
[01:39:43.746 --> 01:39:44.646]  And then it's 65 countries...
[01:39:46.559 --> 01:39:47.380]  Pinax is 63.
[01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:49.662]  End quote, the gap.
[01:39:49.802 --> 01:39:55.487]  And the gap is basically, if you look at a flat map of the world, it's a big giant circle right in the middle.
[01:39:55.527 --> 01:39:59.991]  It's the third world, the equatorial countries and those a couple thousand miles either side of it.
[01:40:01.051 --> 01:40:11.443]  And it's the Malaysias, and it's the African countries, the Nigerias, and it's the Middle Eastern countries, and they've all got to be invaded.
[01:40:11.503 --> 01:40:14.827]  And Latin America needs to... Some areas need to be invaded, and they have been invaded.
[01:40:14.847 --> 01:40:16.990]  There are troops down there right now, by the tens of thousands.
[01:40:17.570 --> 01:40:17.931]  And so...
[01:40:19.985 --> 01:40:23.087]  They play off this false bipolar world, and they say this in policy reports.
[01:40:23.107 --> 01:40:41.762]  They say, the people know there's a one world government, so we've got to act like there isn't, and basically play each other off against each other, building up police states in both poles of the false political system in the name of fighting each other, but really it's an excuse to build up our armaments to dominate the third world and domestic populations.
[01:40:44.369 --> 01:40:49.831]  Around 70% of the funding of our military goes into international conflicts, two-front wars.
[01:40:50.411 --> 01:40:54.733]  Around 30%, that number's growing, is for domestic suppression.
[01:40:55.693 --> 01:41:01.736]  They're going to have CIA offices already due in major cities, military merging with the police, merging with the National Guard with the police.
[01:41:02.376 --> 01:41:12.840]  All the National Guard's going to give you their old command base, but they're going to still have an office in it and have the emergency management center there with FEMA money, and then we're going to basically, through grants, have the cities and counties sign their authority away over to us.
[01:41:13.846 --> 01:41:16.687]  And they have little citizen tattletale squads and Homeland Security squads.
[01:41:16.707 --> 01:41:23.210]  We've had some of their directors and minions and volunteers at every level on and covered it in several of the films.
[01:41:24.591 --> 01:41:27.332]  So that's what's going on.
[01:41:31.214 --> 01:41:31.594]  Okay.
[01:41:32.114 --> 01:41:35.516]  Let's go ahead and go to Daryl in New Hampshire, and that's going to be it for calls for a while because I've got to cover some news.
[01:41:35.536 --> 01:41:36.136]  Daryl, go ahead.
[01:41:38.237 --> 01:41:38.617]  Hello, Alex.
[01:41:40.218 --> 01:41:40.458]  Yes, sir.
[01:41:40.871 --> 01:41:45.432]  Hey, thanks for spreading the truth out there and liberating people's minds.
[01:41:45.492 --> 01:41:45.872]  Thanks, man.
[01:41:46.172 --> 01:41:46.512]  Thank you.
[01:41:46.552 --> 01:41:47.653]  Anything on your mind, sir?
[01:41:48.793 --> 01:41:49.513]  I just don't know.
[01:41:49.633 --> 01:42:07.838]  Like, I'm in, like, a tiny suburban town where, like, there's, like, mad CEOs and all this stuff, and I'm sure that they're semi-involved, and I don't even know how to get myself, like... I'm struggling, but I'm building my courage, and I think I'll see you out there.
[01:42:14.946 --> 01:42:20.269]  Well, we better be afraid of not standing up.
[01:42:20.309 --> 01:42:23.791]  The consequences of doing nothing are much greater than the consequences of standing.
[01:42:25.132 --> 01:42:26.293]  It feels good to stand up.
[01:42:27.133 --> 01:42:29.675]  I'm tired of these psychopathic bullies trying to run our lives.
[01:42:29.695 --> 01:42:31.396]  It's good to hear that you're getting involved.
[01:42:31.456 --> 01:42:32.677]  First, you've got to inform yourself.
[01:42:33.117 --> 01:42:34.638]  Really get educated on the facts.
[01:42:35.345 --> 01:42:37.246]  Then you pick some issues is one good way to do it.
[01:42:37.266 --> 01:42:38.027]  And get involved locally.
[01:42:38.047 --> 01:42:41.609]  You don't have to go defeat the New World War overnight, defeat the dragon yourself.
[01:42:41.670 --> 01:42:44.772]  I mean, we have that Hollywood image of the superhero saving us.
[01:42:45.032 --> 01:42:45.712]  It's all of us.
[01:42:45.772 --> 01:42:47.153]  Little things we do.
[01:42:47.173 --> 01:42:47.974]  It's the little people.
[01:42:48.755 --> 01:42:51.076]  The little man, like Alan Jackson's song.
[01:42:51.156 --> 01:42:52.777]  Thank God for the little man.
[01:42:52.797 --> 01:42:55.319]  Okay, now I'm really torturing people.
[01:42:56.340 --> 01:42:57.741]  Let me get into some of the news here.
[01:42:59.201 --> 01:42:59.701]  Listen to this.
[01:42:59.781 --> 01:43:06.925]  Pentagon hired a contractor to advise on collecting information on churches, mosques, other U.S.
[01:43:06.965 --> 01:43:07.305]  sites.
[01:43:07.625 --> 01:43:16.330]  A Pentagon intelligence agency that kept files on American anti-war activists hired one of the contractors who bribed former Representative Randy Duke Cunningham, Republican of California.
[01:43:16.370 --> 01:43:17.891]  He's the guy that stole 800 plus million.
[01:43:17.911 --> 01:43:18.471]  He's pled guilty.
[01:43:19.091 --> 01:43:24.734]  To help and collect data on houses of worship, schools, power plants, and other locations in the United States.
[01:43:25.234 --> 01:43:26.455]  And it just goes into the spine.
[01:43:26.995 --> 01:43:28.256]  It is so massive.
[01:43:29.091 --> 01:43:29.992]  Here's another one.
[01:43:31.972 --> 01:43:34.254]  Advanced workers for Bush impersonated reporters.
[01:43:34.294 --> 01:43:35.394]  That's Washington Post.
[01:43:35.434 --> 01:43:39.356]  The White House said yesterday it will discipline two government employees who masqueraded as journalists.
[01:43:40.217 --> 01:43:40.737]  Sure they will.
[01:43:41.637 --> 01:43:46.460]  It's like the army recruiter that called up threatening people to go to prison if they didn't come join the military and sign the contract.
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:48.501]  That's racketeering, by the way, and extortion.
[01:43:48.521 --> 01:43:51.302]  They're enforcing what they're doing.
[01:43:52.325 --> 01:43:55.167]  And they gave him a bonus and made him the head of the whole region.
[01:43:56.528 --> 01:44:02.613]  Just like the head of the Met Police who did the big cover-up shooting Demendez 14 times.
[01:44:02.853 --> 01:44:04.315]  He's now getting a giant cash bonus.
[01:44:05.776 --> 01:44:10.660]  The FBI agents that ordered their underlings not to stop, quote, Al-Qaeda before 9-11, they got record cash bonuses.
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:13.502]  The others got demoted or fired to try to stop Al-Qaeda.
[01:44:14.122 --> 01:44:18.546]  Mississippi couple whose home was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina and two men who later identified themselves as service agents...
[01:44:19.289 --> 01:44:24.993]  Pretended to be Fox News journalists, same thing, when surveying their neighborhood in advance of a March 8 visit from President Bush.
[01:44:25.013 --> 01:44:34.099]  Just another example of secret police everywhere, and they'll now be our new national police under the auspices of the Expanded Patriot Act.
[01:44:34.719 --> 01:44:35.960]  Here's a really scary article.
[01:44:37.861 --> 01:44:42.484]  MI5 helped IRA buy bomb parts in U.S.
[01:44:43.945 --> 01:44:48.828]  We have the related MI5, MI6 involvement in IRA terrorism archive under that that we posted there, and
[01:44:49.682 --> 01:44:57.752]  And a link to Paul's book, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror in the New World Order, a free chapter on it from the book, British Intelligence, Her Majesty's Terrorist Network.
[01:44:58.152 --> 01:45:07.644]  A former British Army mole in the IRA has claimed that MI5 arranged weapons buying crypto-America in which he obtained detonators later used by terrorists to murder soldiers.
[01:45:08.837 --> 01:45:09.778]  And police officers.
[01:45:09.798 --> 01:45:23.286]  In a book to be published next month, the spy who uses the pseudonym Kevin Fulton describes in detail how the British intelligence cooperated with the FBI to ensure his trip to New York in the 1990s went ahead without incident so that his cover would not be blown.
[01:45:24.047 --> 01:45:27.489]  He goes in to talk about how he supplied the detonators used to carry out the bomb.
[01:45:27.509 --> 01:45:28.570]  Folks, they build the bombs.
[01:45:28.590 --> 01:45:30.531]  There's hundreds of articles and admissions.
[01:45:30.911 --> 01:45:33.533]  They go break people's legs and they refuse to carry out the bombing.
[01:45:33.793 --> 01:45:36.295]  In every case we looked at, they commanded the IRA.
[01:45:38.109 --> 01:45:38.689]  Hardliners.
[01:45:39.470 --> 01:45:42.651]  The British intel sat as the heads of the IRA.
[01:45:42.671 --> 01:45:51.174]  So this is just one new little cherry on top, or maybe a little nut on the sundae, of just hundreds of pieces that make this gourmet treat.
[01:45:52.615 --> 01:45:56.817]  On the anniversary of the invasion, Bush and Cheney see Iraq's successes.
[01:45:56.877 --> 01:46:02.539]  On the third anniversary of the war that they once expected to be over, by now, they said within six months guaranteed,
[01:46:03.775 --> 01:46:05.077]  They swore our troops would be home.
[01:46:05.477 --> 01:46:06.979]  Their own battle plan said 20 years.
[01:46:07.399 --> 01:46:19.252]  President Bush and senior officials argued Sunday that their strategy was working despite escalating violence in Iraq, even as the former Iraqi Prime Minister, once favored by the White House, declared that a civil war had already started.
[01:46:20.593 --> 01:46:24.297]  And it goes on with their ridiculous quotes and Bush saying that...
[01:46:25.276 --> 01:46:27.477]  Things are better now than they were.
[01:46:27.877 --> 01:46:29.098]  And we don't want to cut and run.
[01:46:29.618 --> 01:46:34.560]  The Pentagon's own plan is to have civil war and break that country up and stay there as long as possible.
[01:46:34.620 --> 01:46:35.601]  We see it as a failure.
[01:46:35.641 --> 01:46:36.861]  The globalists see it as a victory.
[01:46:36.881 --> 01:46:40.563]  It's like the war on drugs is a court of failure if you believe what they claim it is.
[01:46:40.903 --> 01:46:49.047]  But no, if it's to get control, put your kids in prison, which the big cartels openly own, and then bring in the majority of the drugs themselves, then it's a great success.
[01:46:51.628 --> 01:46:53.649]  And I've made that point many times, so I will not belabor it.
[01:46:55.629 --> 01:46:58.011]  Impeach Bush chorus grows, London Times.
[01:46:58.671 --> 01:47:10.039]  The movement to impeach President George W. Bush over the war on terror began with a few tatty bumper stickers on the back of battered old Volvos and slogans such as Bush Live People Died on far-left websites.
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:19.646]  But as Democratic hopes rise of gaining control of Congress this autumn, dreams of impeaching Bush are no longer confined to his political fringe.
[01:47:19.706 --> 01:47:22.508]  I remember people thought we couldn't start the impeachment of Clinton, but we did.
[01:47:23.291 --> 01:47:29.573]  A poll last week found that voters by 50% to 37% who are against would prefer the Democrats to control Congress.
[01:47:30.033 --> 01:47:35.875]  If Bush opponents find themselves in opposition to power, the temptation to humiliate him is likely to be irresistible.
[01:47:37.355 --> 01:47:40.176]  And Ron Paul says they'll probably impeach him, but it'll just be political.
[01:47:40.196 --> 01:47:43.777]  I mean, then they'll oppose as our saviors while being for the exact same policies.
[01:47:45.158 --> 01:47:46.438]  Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
[01:47:47.046 --> 01:47:51.029]  But Ron Paul and others have said it would probably be a good thing because anything to limit executive power is good.
[01:47:51.069 --> 01:47:53.671]  We're in danger of total open dictatorship.
[01:47:54.592 --> 01:47:56.954]  Small town provokes big outrage in Vermont.
[01:47:56.994 --> 01:47:57.834]  Vote to impeach Bush.
[01:47:57.954 --> 01:47:58.715]  Sparks backlash.
[01:47:58.735 --> 01:48:04.619]  And they say that the majority of Vermonters, of course, want to impeach him, but they're getting hate calls and letters from all over the country.
[01:48:06.361 --> 01:48:09.183]  By the neocons, who are the minority but try to intimidate everybody.
[01:48:09.776 --> 01:48:12.237]  Chavez blasts Bush as donkey and drunkard.
[01:48:12.257 --> 01:48:14.918]  I don't know about him being a donkey, but he is a drunkard.
[01:48:15.278 --> 01:48:19.780]  Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on Sunday lobbed a litany of insults at U.S.
[01:48:19.820 --> 01:48:25.503]  President Bush, ranging from donkey to drunkard, in response to a White House report branding the left-wing leader a demigod.
[01:48:26.143 --> 01:48:35.787]  Chavez is one of America's fiercest critics and has repeatedly accused the United States government of seeking to oust him from the presidency of Venezuela, the world's number five oil exporter and a supplier of around 50% of U.S.
[01:48:35.847 --> 01:48:36.628]  crude imports.
[01:48:37.008 --> 01:48:37.568]  They own Sitco.
[01:48:38.439 --> 01:48:42.440]  You are a donkey, Mr. Bush, said Chavez, speaking in English on his weekly Sunday broadcast.
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:44.481]  You're an alcoholic, Mr. Danger.
[01:48:44.961 --> 01:48:50.503]  Or rather, you're a drunkard, Chavez said, referring to Bush by the nickname he frequently uses to describe the U.S.
[01:48:50.543 --> 01:48:50.863]  President.
[01:48:52.864 --> 01:48:53.964]  I've got to laugh at that.
[01:48:54.424 --> 01:48:55.465]  Pillaring Bush.
[01:48:56.105 --> 01:48:56.725]  Pillaring him.
[01:48:56.745 --> 01:48:59.626]  That's where they put you in the stocks and throw rotten food at you.
[01:49:00.767 --> 01:49:07.149]  You know the old movies where they show old plays, people don't like the play, or the comedian, they throw rotten cabbages and eggs.
[01:49:07.169 --> 01:49:07.949]  That's pillaring him.
[01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:12.143]  And this type of pillory does nothing.
[01:49:13.844 --> 01:49:15.726]  And I guess it makes constituents happy.
[01:49:15.826 --> 01:49:16.566]  Bush is a puppet.
[01:49:17.407 --> 01:49:18.328]  That's what is effective.
[01:49:18.348 --> 01:49:20.409]  To describe how he's a titular, nothing.
[01:49:20.750 --> 01:49:21.550]  Just like Bill Clinton was.
[01:49:22.911 --> 01:49:25.033]  You get all caught up just attacking these people, it does nothing.
[01:49:26.835 --> 01:49:27.235]  Here it is.
[01:49:27.315 --> 01:49:30.257]  Blundering Met police chief in line for 34,000 pounds.
[01:49:30.277 --> 01:49:31.639]  Excuse me, I said dollar.
[01:49:32.079 --> 01:49:32.719]  So that's about $60,000. $60,000.
[01:49:35.518 --> 01:49:36.759]  Cash bonus for doing a great job.
[01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:39.281]  He's the guy that covered up the killing of Demendez.
[01:49:40.202 --> 01:49:41.063]  A lot more coming up.
[01:49:41.083 --> 01:49:42.184]  We'll take a few more calls, too.
[01:49:42.224 --> 01:49:50.031]  I'm going to go live until 8 after, and then we'll come back and play the Charlie Sheen interview right here on the GCN radio network.
[01:49:50.071 --> 01:49:50.851]  This is Genesis.
[01:49:51.412 --> 01:49:53.073]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:54.434 --> 01:49:57.297]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:49:58.021 --> 01:49:59.302]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:49:59.522 --> 01:50:05.245]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:50:05.525 --> 01:50:10.788]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:50:11.068 --> 01:50:15.190]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:50:15.390 --> 01:50:19.174]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[01:50:19.435 --> 01:50:24.080]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:50:24.180 --> 01:50:30.427]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.467 --> 01:50:32.309]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[01:50:32.769 --> 01:50:34.851]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyrion today.

[01:51:01.323 --> 01:51:12.249]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because incredibly they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:51:12.509 --> 01:51:14.311]  Yet require very little energy.
[01:51:14.591 --> 01:51:17.914]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[01:51:18.234 --> 01:51:28.683]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[01:51:28.983 --> 01:51:29.484]  That's right.
[01:51:29.664 --> 01:51:36.790]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.

[01:55:49.008 --> 01:55:56.871]  Well, what I'll do as soon as you get the call is straight, is I'll, because remember, they're up in Minnesota, folks, and I'm down here in Austin, Texas, so I always have to
[01:55:57.662 --> 01:56:00.424]  I could use the instant messenger, but I tend to be in the Stone Age here.
[01:56:01.304 --> 01:56:02.765]  So I always just have them tell me the names.
[01:56:02.805 --> 01:56:07.048]  I write them down and go to them and then shuffle the papers and can't get to them.
[01:56:07.709 --> 01:56:09.270]  Mike in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:56:09.310 --> 01:56:09.750]  Go ahead.
[01:56:10.170 --> 01:56:19.096]  Yeah, how did the anthrax mailings and the smallpox scare and the West Nile virus follow up with 9-11 and what Charlie Seen said?
[01:56:20.717 --> 01:56:24.179]  Well, we know the anthrax was a White House ordered op.
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:26.401]  All of Bush's enemies got the letters.
[01:56:27.375 --> 01:56:36.042]  From the guy that did a story about his daughters falling down drunk to people that, you know, the leader of the Senate, Daschle.
[01:56:37.163 --> 01:56:38.404]  And we know it was super U.S.
[01:56:38.444 --> 01:56:44.008]  designed, high grade, $100 million piece of equipment it takes just to coat them in bentonite.
[01:56:44.068 --> 01:56:52.575]  They actually put little wings on each spore so they get picked up by the air and stay buoyant in the atmosphere for inhalation.
[01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:59.104]  And we know he was on Cipro on starting September 10th with his cabinet, Associated Press.
[01:56:59.124 --> 01:57:02.386]  Ari Fleischer, White House Press Secretary, also confirmed that when he was questioned.
[01:57:02.406 --> 01:57:03.927]  And we know that it came from Fort Detrick, Maryland.
[01:57:04.247 --> 01:57:06.689]  We know they tried to cover that up and claimed somebody made it in their bathtub.
[01:57:07.469 --> 01:57:08.730]  So that was a government op.
[01:57:08.790 --> 01:57:10.191]  And then you mentioned, what else did you mention?
[01:57:11.652 --> 01:57:13.853]  They were saying that some columnist in Iowa was behind it.
[01:57:14.214 --> 01:57:14.674]  What was that about?
[01:57:15.316 --> 01:57:16.036]  No, that wasn't true.
[01:57:16.577 --> 01:57:18.638]  They tried to claim it was Stephen Hadfield, too, and that wasn't true.
[01:57:18.658 --> 01:57:19.979]  And then you mentioned West Nile.
[01:57:20.419 --> 01:57:28.004]  West Nile, we know our government in 1984, and then again in 1990, mailed that stuff to Saddam Hussein.
[01:57:28.104 --> 01:57:28.544]  And then again in 1994.
[01:57:28.624 --> 01:57:31.646]  And then they tried to claim he did it, which he didn't.
[01:57:31.666 --> 01:57:32.726]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:33.927 --> 01:57:38.170]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.509 --> 01:57:50.170]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.830 --> 01:57:51.871]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.592 --> 01:57:53.713]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.373 --> 01:57:55.174]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.934 --> 01:57:56.815]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.835 --> 01:58:01.158]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.658 --> 01:58:05.802]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.664 --> 01:58:09.324]  Welcome back.
[01:58:09.484 --> 01:58:13.107]  Now into the third and final hour of this live Monday edition.
[01:58:15.088 --> 01:58:17.110]  Because the server's overloaded and crashed.
[01:58:19.565 --> 01:58:25.007]  In the first hour with Charlie and some of our audience on the web, I was unable to hear it, and people were questioning it.
[01:58:25.027 --> 01:58:25.567]  It didn't tune in.
[01:58:25.587 --> 01:58:29.768]  Well, we're going to re-air that interview coming up here in the next segment, so you do not want to miss it.
[01:58:30.028 --> 01:58:31.829]  Talking about 9-11 and several other issues.
[01:58:31.849 --> 01:58:34.129]  We'll be back on with us in the near future.
[01:58:36.510 --> 01:58:38.991]  Here is an article out of the London Telegraph today.
[01:58:39.011 --> 01:58:41.832]  A lifelong vaccine will end the booster jab ordeal.
[01:58:42.924 --> 01:58:59.796]  Touted as the next best thing to slice bread, and it says that they give you the shot, and then the vaccine is a microcapsule of a type of compound similar to what they find in ancient fossilized ferns.
[01:59:01.217 --> 01:59:04.219]  Yes, and then it just slow releases the biological agent.
[01:59:04.239 --> 01:59:10.043]  I mean, you talk about a deadly bio-weapon, and you spray everybody with this stuff, it's in them, and then at a certain point it...
[01:59:12.586 --> 01:59:16.648]  I read they have these as bioweapons that get into your system and are already encapsulated.
[01:59:16.668 --> 01:59:20.169]  I heard about this exact science from sources long before it happened.
[01:59:21.810 --> 01:59:23.551]  And long before it was announced.
[01:59:23.611 --> 01:59:25.392]  And it's just incredible.
[01:59:25.412 --> 01:59:29.253]  And then you can hit it with a certain wavelength, certain resonance, break it loose, have it unfold.
[01:59:29.993 --> 01:59:31.674]  And this is really, really scary.
[01:59:31.694 --> 01:59:38.377]  They had another article a few years ago in the London Telegraph where, oh, they have vaccines they give you that have a viral attack of your brain.
[01:59:39.258 --> 01:59:49.732]  It says the virus goes in and creates plaques in the neuroreceptors the electrochemical receptors that would pick up nicotine or opiates or cocaine any type of narcotic
[01:59:50.453 --> 01:59:52.935]  And cigarettes hit those same receptors.
[01:59:53.055 --> 01:59:55.137]  But, yeah, you won't be able to get addicted anymore.
[01:59:55.177 --> 02:00:02.382]  You also won't be able to pick up your regular endorphins that you're supposed to get when you break a leg or in a car wreck.
[02:00:03.783 --> 02:00:05.845]  You get giddy and you've really never been hurt.
[02:00:06.205 --> 02:00:08.227]  Your body gives you its own painkillers.
[02:00:08.687 --> 02:00:13.571]  Also, when you score a touchdown or you make that great business deal or you do the right thing and help the old lady, you feel good.
[02:00:14.914 --> 02:00:18.797]  We're designed to be good creatures at many levels.
[02:00:18.957 --> 02:00:20.699]  God gave us that to reward us when we do good.
[02:00:21.319 --> 02:00:29.465]  And so you feel good because your body produces its natural endorphins to supply you for doing good.
[02:00:31.427 --> 02:00:41.635]  Or, you know, when you wanted to date that girl for years and you finally get her to go out with you and you have a great time and you're dropping her off, she gives you a kiss at the door, you get that good endorphin because that's a good thing you're doing.
[02:00:41.995 --> 02:00:43.276]  You're getting yourself a nice mate.
[02:00:44.477 --> 02:00:46.157]  Or vice versa for a woman towards a man.
[02:00:46.177 --> 02:00:49.018]  They just said, oh, there'll be a slight problem.
[02:00:49.038 --> 02:00:54.119]  It might hurt feeling good, but we can give you medication that'll counteract that.
[02:00:54.899 --> 02:00:57.500]  So take away your natural brain.
[02:00:57.560 --> 02:00:58.280]  Oh, that sounds good.
[02:00:58.320 --> 02:01:03.241]  A virus that attacks the neuroreceptors and creates plaques.
[02:01:04.042 --> 02:01:05.342]  How wonderful.
[02:01:06.735 --> 02:01:12.576]  I mean, everybody knows that's why narcotics are bad, is because they burn out or jam up or fill your normal receptors.
[02:01:12.596 --> 02:01:13.877]  After a while, they can come back.
[02:01:14.357 --> 02:01:16.737]  But not with this, not with the viral attack.
[02:01:16.777 --> 02:01:19.618]  The whole new class of bioweapons is what they are.
[02:01:19.658 --> 02:01:20.658]  And, oh, your child needs it.
[02:01:20.698 --> 02:01:22.898]  You don't want them to get hooked on cocaine.
[02:01:22.918 --> 02:01:27.139]  6,000 Americans out of 300 million people die every year from illegal drugs.
[02:01:27.159 --> 02:01:28.240]  That's the official government numbers.
[02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:34.441]  The conservative numbers, what they admit for dying from prescription drugs, just bad reactions.
[02:01:35.353 --> 02:01:36.474]  Or drug interactions is 130,000.
[02:01:37.194 --> 02:01:46.520]  And, of course, go read the adverse reactions to all of the big pharma drugs.
[02:01:47.580 --> 02:01:53.023]  And, again, they're never a natural plant or natural drug because then they can't have a patent on it.
[02:01:54.104 --> 02:02:01.528]  All the stuff they make is totally synthetic, mainly out of petrochemicals, so that then they can hold a certain patent on a new creation.
[02:02:01.548 --> 02:02:02.329]  It has to be synthetic.
[02:02:03.346 --> 02:02:11.872]  So that's why illegal drugs are so much worse than even the very destructive, run-of-the-mill garden variety, literal garden narcotics.
[02:02:12.512 --> 02:02:17.676]  Opium from the poppy, cocaine from the coca leaf, things of that nature.
[02:02:18.196 --> 02:02:19.977]  Tobacco from North Carolina.
[02:02:21.398 --> 02:02:22.419]  Get the same receptors.
[02:02:23.279 --> 02:02:24.060]  Very chilling.
[02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:26.782]  Websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlant.com.
[02:02:27.062 --> 02:02:30.104]  Coming up later this afternoon, we'll have an article out on the Charlie Sheen bombshell interview.
[02:02:30.644 --> 02:02:31.925]  We'll have it posted up there for you as well.
[02:02:32.836 --> 02:02:34.879]  Right now, we'll see if we smoke the servers again.
[02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:36.962]  Go ahead and roll on the other side.
[02:02:37.583 --> 02:02:38.464]  Be sure and stay with us.
[02:02:38.524 --> 02:02:42.189]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:02:46.437 --> 02:02:49.280]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.540 --> 02:02:50.241]  Hello, my friends.
[02:02:50.341 --> 02:02:51.121]  Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.462 --> 02:02:56.146]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.487 --> 02:03:03.213]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:03.553 --> 02:03:05.515]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:05.735 --> 02:03:08.558]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.678 --> 02:03:13.322]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.542 --> 02:03:17.946]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.186 --> 02:03:25.413]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:25.653 --> 02:03:28.075]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:03:28.235 --> 02:03:29.977]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:03:45.535 --> 02:03:49.017]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:03:49.297 --> 02:03:52.799]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:03:52.879 --> 02:03:56.822]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:03:57.042 --> 02:04:03.205]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:04:03.605 --> 02:04:11.530]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:04:11.930 --> 02:04:17.274]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:04:17.434 --> 02:04:21.196]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:21.577 --> 02:04:23.418]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[02:04:23.478 --> 02:04:25.659]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:04:25.900 --> 02:04:30.242]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[02:04:30.302 --> 02:04:36.266]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:04:36.326 --> 02:04:36.667]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:41.630 --> 02:04:42.353]  4438 protects your family.
[02:04:45.316 --> 02:04:48.457]  We understand that decisions related to health can be overwhelming.
[02:04:48.697 --> 02:04:55.519]  That is why at ResearchedHerbs.com we take pride in offering you herbs whose safety and effectiveness have been proven time and time again.
[02:04:55.939 --> 02:05:09.303]  For example, did you know that Live52, the top-selling natural herbal supplement for liver diseases since 1930, is backed by over 300 research studies and clinical trials and prescribed by more than 200,000 health professionals worldwide?
[02:05:09.623 --> 02:05:13.364]  In fact, the effectiveness of all the herbs featured on ResearchedHerbs.com
[02:05:13.677 --> 02:05:14.698]  We're good to go.
[02:05:45.916 --> 02:05:51.943]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:52.564 --> 02:05:55.608]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:58.110 --> 02:06:05.940]  He's been in over 65 major motion pictures, produced them, written them, from Platoon to Red Dawn, one of my favorites.
[02:06:07.702 --> 02:06:10.444]  And of course, TV shows like Spin City.
[02:06:10.724 --> 02:06:15.648]  Right now he's the major star on the CBS program Two and a Half Men.
[02:06:16.489 --> 02:06:20.672]  And he's got several new movies coming out this year and next year.
[02:06:21.633 --> 02:06:25.196]  And when I got a chance to talk to Charlie Sheen, I was just amazed.
[02:06:25.236 --> 02:06:27.558]  Because I've talked to a lot of other big Hollywood people.
[02:06:27.578 --> 02:06:28.659]  We've had a few of them on this show.
[02:06:29.620 --> 02:06:30.121]  We're good to go.
[02:06:43.983 --> 02:06:48.566]  Really knows what's going on on the planet today, but that shouldn't surprise me.
[02:06:48.606 --> 02:06:52.368]  His father, Martin Sheen, has been on the front lines.
[02:06:53.208 --> 02:07:02.673]  As Mark Twain said in the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man, hated and feared and scorned, but in time when his cause succeeds, the timid join him because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[02:07:03.053 --> 02:07:04.974]  And, of course, it's been proven right time and time again.
[02:07:05.014 --> 02:07:05.895]  It was his father in the...
[02:07:06.715 --> 02:07:11.976]  In the days leading up to the war, that was the most vocal spokesman in America against this disastrous conflict.
[02:07:12.016 --> 02:07:13.296]  Everything he said has now come true.
[02:07:13.776 --> 02:07:19.638]  And of course, Charlie Sheen and his brother are also activists in their own right.
[02:07:19.758 --> 02:07:24.518]  And we are just incredibly honored to have Charlie Sheen on with us for the balance of this hour.
[02:07:24.558 --> 02:07:25.679]  Mr. Sheen, good to have you with us.
[02:07:26.219 --> 02:07:27.059]  Nice to be here, Alex.
[02:07:27.079 --> 02:07:27.479]  How are you?
[02:07:28.279 --> 02:07:29.139]  I'm great.
[02:07:29.579 --> 02:07:32.880]  Before we get into the really serious stuff, tell me a little bit about Two and a Half Men.
[02:07:33.815 --> 02:07:35.617]  Well, gosh, we're thrilled.
[02:07:36.437 --> 02:07:38.359]  We are at the end of our third season.
[02:07:40.180 --> 02:07:43.223]  We have three more shows to shoot.
[02:07:43.343 --> 02:07:52.911]  Most sitcoms will shoot 22 episodes, but because the network always wants more product, we do 24.
[02:07:53.812 --> 02:07:57.635]  So our season will continue when all the other shows have shut down.
[02:07:58.656 --> 02:07:59.357]  But it's going good.
[02:07:59.417 --> 02:08:00.277]  It's going really good.
[02:08:01.957 --> 02:08:13.246]  We've found ourselves sort of in or around the top ten for most of this year, and we found out we got picked up for next season, which is fabulous.
[02:08:14.467 --> 02:08:27.377]  And what's happening is they're using our show to launch new shows, which is the sign of great confidence and trust in us sort of being the anchor of that Monday night lineup, you know?
[02:08:29.230 --> 02:08:34.733]  So with that, I should probably throw out a shameless plug on tonight's show, if that's all right.
[02:08:34.813 --> 02:08:35.133]  Oh, sure.
[02:08:35.173 --> 02:08:36.114]  Tell us about tonight's show.
[02:08:36.774 --> 02:08:42.357]  Tonight's show is entitled The Spit-Covered Cobbler.
[02:08:43.237 --> 02:08:48.660]  And it's funny because the title of our show will always relate to a line of dialogue.
[02:08:49.300 --> 02:08:56.564]  And so it's about my brother Alan, played by John Cryer, and he's dating a girl who has no money.
[02:08:57.242 --> 02:09:00.463]  And so, he doesn't have any money himself.
[02:09:01.023 --> 02:09:06.664]  I sort of support him on the show because I took him in when he went through a divorce with his kid, played by Angus Jones, right?
[02:09:07.785 --> 02:09:12.826]  And so, he's dealing with a woman, April Bowlby, who plays Candy on the show.
[02:09:13.346 --> 02:09:16.747]  And she's fabulous and she's beautiful, but she's broke.
[02:09:17.107 --> 02:09:17.967]  Imagine that, right?
[02:09:18.647 --> 02:09:25.129]  So, John is forced to pick up the tab for a lot of her bills.
[02:09:25.289 --> 02:09:25.529]  And that...
[02:09:26.644 --> 02:09:28.367]  That leads to some pretty funny scenarios.
[02:09:29.049 --> 02:09:30.812]  What time is that showing this evening?
[02:09:31.533 --> 02:09:34.578]  It's on CBS, 9 o'clock, 8 central.
[02:09:35.039 --> 02:09:36.302]  All right, well, I'll have to tune into that.
[02:09:36.983 --> 02:09:38.465]  Now, Mr. Sheen...
[02:09:39.571 --> 02:09:48.253]  You have some questions about the official 9-11 story, and we got hooked up because we both mutually have been looking into that.
[02:09:49.413 --> 02:09:58.256]  And I want to just, I guess, start by what happened on 9-11, what your instincts told you, and really just go from there.
[02:09:59.476 --> 02:10:03.617]  Well, it was interesting, and let me just preface that by saying that
[02:10:05.256 --> 02:10:31.640]  I've been a fan of yours for a long time and I've been following you and I've seen all of your documentaries and your research is tireless and it's interesting because a lot of these guys you sort of look behind the notes and you start to discover inconsistencies in a lot of the claims that they're making which pretty much torpedoes the credibility of most of their substance but
[02:10:32.409 --> 02:10:34.672]  With you, that's not the case.
[02:10:35.072 --> 02:10:41.200]  And I was always amazed to see that you always had hard data to back up your claims.
[02:10:41.540 --> 02:10:50.832]  And so, this was tough for me because for the longest time I've been doing my own independent research and
[02:10:52.159 --> 02:11:10.832]  You know, I don't claim to be an expert in any of these fields, but just as a concerned, upstanding, tax-paying American citizen, there's just... There's questions I have that I wish somebody could explain away for me.
[02:11:11.473 --> 02:11:18.658]  There's things that one will view and then look at the King Commission's official report, and it just...
[02:11:20.990 --> 02:11:21.230]  Well, yeah.
[02:11:21.270 --> 02:11:23.032]  It's like they want to just pigeonhole...
[02:11:45.791 --> 02:12:01.136]  All of us into this group of conspiracy nutbags when we're not really debating things that are related to UFOs bringing down the towers or Building 7 or the Pentagon, right?
[02:12:01.256 --> 02:12:10.338]  And so it just feels like there's things in there that...
[02:12:12.847 --> 02:12:13.508]  I think we're good to go.
[02:12:28.593 --> 02:12:30.214]  That feels like a conspiracy theory.
[02:12:30.474 --> 02:12:35.375]  Well, I tell you, back in 2001, everybody admits that cell phones didn't work over 3,000 feet.
[02:12:35.395 --> 02:12:37.096]  How were they working at 33,000, 32,000 feet?
[02:12:37.156 --> 02:12:41.077]  How did Al-Qaeda make NORAD stand down?
[02:12:41.097 --> 02:12:46.779]  Did Al-Qaeda call Mayor Willie Brown of San Francisco, as the Chronicle reported, and say, don't fly to New York?
[02:12:46.859 --> 02:12:47.879]  No, the White House did.
[02:12:48.719 --> 02:12:50.700]  Yeah, the answer to that would be probably not.
[02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:50.780]  But...
[02:13:15.382 --> 02:13:29.820]  No, it's just the more you look at stuff, especially specific incidents, specific events around the Faithful Day, it just raises a lot of questions.
[02:13:30.201 --> 02:13:33.906]  There's a lot of questions, and I know that a couple of years ago,
[02:13:34.668 --> 02:13:39.271]  It was, you know, severely unpopular to discuss any of this.
[02:13:40.811 --> 02:13:50.677]  But it sort of feels like, just in my research and in the people that I talk to and in and around my circles, it seems like the worm is turning.
[02:13:51.757 --> 02:14:00.422]  Because you start talking about this, even with conservative Republicans, and they can't really debate away...
[02:14:01.890 --> 02:14:06.053]  Some of the most obvious facts on that day.
[02:14:06.253 --> 02:14:08.375]  Let me ask my radio producer a question.
[02:14:08.775 --> 02:14:10.877]  Did you find that clip of Dan Rather?
[02:14:12.198 --> 02:14:19.123]  Let me just roll this little 30-second clip, because this is what Dan Rather thought about 20 seconds after Building 7 collapsed.
[02:14:19.504 --> 02:14:22.466]  They backed the tape up and played it, and this is what he said live.
[02:14:22.486 --> 02:14:23.147]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:14:23.747 --> 02:14:25.869]  Again, what you're seeing are high shots.
[02:14:27.757 --> 02:14:31.541]  Now, here we're going to show you a videotape of the collapse itself.
[02:14:31.581 --> 02:14:33.783]  Now we go to videotape the collapse of this building.
[02:14:34.844 --> 02:14:35.404]  It's amazing.
[02:14:36.685 --> 02:14:38.767]  Amazing, incredible, pick your word.
[02:14:39.728 --> 02:14:50.498]  For the third time today, reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before, when a building was deliberately destroyed by world-class dynamite to knock it down,
[02:14:51.630 --> 02:14:55.393]  All right, so there's Dan Rather, and that's what I thought that morning.
[02:14:55.433 --> 02:15:00.658]  That's what engineers, the heads of engineering colleges, that's what a lot of people said.
[02:15:01.559 --> 02:15:02.960]  Charlie, what did you think on that morning?
[02:15:04.822 --> 02:15:07.744]  Well, where do we start?
[02:15:08.024 --> 02:15:16.492]  I was up early, actually, and we were going to do a pre-shoot on Spin City, the show I used to do.
[02:15:18.084 --> 02:15:25.850]  And so, gosh, I was up, and I was watching the news, and the North Tower was burning.
[02:15:26.770 --> 02:15:34.216]  And so, you know, the world was focused on what I guess they were assuming to be pilot error, right?
[02:15:34.256 --> 02:15:37.018]  Or some tragedy nobody could really explain.
[02:15:37.038 --> 02:15:41.161]  And so I saw the South Tower hit live.
[02:15:42.462 --> 02:15:46.925]  That famous wide shot where it disappears behind the building, and then we see the tremendous fireball, you know?
[02:15:48.031 --> 02:15:56.793]  And there was just a feeling that it just didn't look... How do I say this?
[02:15:57.113 --> 02:16:03.814]  It didn't look like any commercial jetliner I've flown on any time in my life.
[02:16:04.975 --> 02:16:15.977]  And then when the buildings came down, later on that day, I was with my brother, I was at my parents' house, and we were out on the deck, and I said, Hey, call me insane.
[02:16:16.730 --> 02:16:22.411]  But did it sort of look like those buildings came down in a controlled demolition?
[02:16:22.431 --> 02:16:29.493]  And he said, well, kind of, but gosh, that's impossible if you think about what it would take for them to orchestrate that.
[02:16:30.693 --> 02:16:37.615]  And so, as the days and the weeks went on, I was sort of told what to believe.
[02:16:37.935 --> 02:16:41.856]  And I was told through mainstream media and all of the talking heads that
[02:16:42.481 --> 02:16:43.603]  About what really happened.
[02:16:43.843 --> 02:16:54.279]  Now, Charlie, when the press hears your interview, if they think it's radical that you thought it looked like explosives, they better go talk to Dan Rather than the host of CBS Nightly News.
[02:16:54.339 --> 02:16:58.085]  And we also have a clip of Peter Jennings saying the exact same thing twice.
[02:16:58.785 --> 02:17:05.908]  So he says it looks like bombs, so I guess they'll have to dig up poor Peter Jennings and gripe at him for thinking the same thing that you and I thought.
[02:17:06.368 --> 02:17:12.851]  Of course, but what bothers me even more about all of this is that all of this stuff exists from day one.
[02:17:13.511 --> 02:17:16.893]  If you start looking at all of the news reporting after day one...
[02:17:18.673 --> 02:17:24.778]  The official story starts to find its way into our consciousness.
[02:17:24.878 --> 02:17:26.940]  They start telling us the conspiracy theory.
[02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:30.623]  The conspiracy theorists in the government start telling us their wild-eyed conspiracies.
[02:17:31.364 --> 02:17:31.804]  Exactly.
[02:17:33.145 --> 02:17:37.209]  And so we all go away from what we felt in our gut initially.
[02:17:37.629 --> 02:17:38.870]  Charlie Sheen, stay right there.
[02:17:38.910 --> 02:17:39.611]  We've got a break.
[02:17:39.651 --> 02:17:40.512]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:40.932 --> 02:17:41.993]  Folks, strap yourselves in.
[02:17:45.791 --> 02:17:47.392]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:17:47.532 --> 02:17:51.635]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:17:51.775 --> 02:17:54.657]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:17:54.737 --> 02:18:01.441]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:18:01.641 --> 02:18:04.643]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:18:04.843 --> 02:18:07.225]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:18:07.365 --> 02:18:12.068]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove
[02:18:12.248 --> 02:18:17.533]  Try halomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aprazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[02:18:17.713 --> 02:18:18.454]  MTBE.
[02:18:18.674 --> 02:18:19.495]  Radon-222.
[02:18:19.595 --> 02:18:21.577]  Foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur.
[02:18:21.717 --> 02:18:22.558]  Even nitrates.
[02:18:22.838 --> 02:18:26.842]  And unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[02:18:27.003 --> 02:18:34.690]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-888-7000.
[02:18:36.732 --> 02:18:37.152]  We're good to go.
[02:19:05.891 --> 02:19:06.972]  We're good to go.
[02:19:25.148 --> 02:19:25.549]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:45.225 --> 02:19:47.626]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:48.166 --> 02:19:57.830]  Did you know that in 1975, 32 senators and 92 representatives signed the Declaration of Interdependence, which stated that we must bring about a new world order?
[02:19:57.850 --> 02:20:02.532]  It called for the surrender of our national sovereignty to international organizations.
[02:20:03.252 --> 02:20:03.953]  We're good to go.
[02:20:19.968 --> 02:20:27.734]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:27.974 --> 02:20:29.796]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:29.816 --> 02:20:30.256]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:30.276 --> 02:20:30.656]  Call now.
[02:20:30.676 --> 02:20:33.318]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[02:20:45.237 --> 02:20:46.917]  What causes foods to spoil?
[02:20:47.337 --> 02:20:50.318]  All produce produces a natural gas which causes ripening.
[02:20:50.638 --> 02:20:55.939]  In addition, foods like onions and garlic emit odors, causing foods to lose their freshness and flavor.
[02:20:56.239 --> 02:21:05.761]  Now there's Forever Fresh for the fridge, a revolutionary new product proven to eliminate refrigerator odors and guaranteed to keep produce fresh at least twice as long as normal.
[02:21:06.041 --> 02:21:08.242]  Nancy McKimson of Jacksonville, Florida says...
[02:21:08.542 --> 02:21:12.085]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, everything stays fresh much longer.
[02:21:12.345 --> 02:21:15.567]  Like strawberries, which now last a couple of weeks instead of just a few days.
[02:21:15.847 --> 02:21:19.390]  Jane Burke of New Jersey says... You know, we eat a lot of salads.
[02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:23.013]  I used to throw out the leftovers because they'd turn brown and they'd shrivel up.
[02:21:23.153 --> 02:21:24.414]  I'm really amazed.
[02:21:24.574 --> 02:21:30.418]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, all my produce stays fresher longer, including the leftovers.
[02:21:30.558 --> 02:21:32.980]  Now I just couldn't get along without Forever Fresh.
[02:21:33.320 --> 02:21:41.446]  To order your Forever Fresh for the fridge, visit the web at foreverfresh.us or call toll-free 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[02:21:41.626 --> 02:21:43.627]  That's 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[02:21:45.148 --> 02:21:49.191]  Well, I won't back down.
[02:21:49.611 --> 02:21:52.333]  No, we're not backing down.
[02:21:52.413 --> 02:21:55.295]  Well, I won't back down.
[02:22:02.865 --> 02:22:04.148]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:05.450 --> 02:22:09.838]  There are those attempting to break down the sovereignty and the freedoms that are in this country and they're failing.
[02:22:10.258 --> 02:22:14.105]  More and more Americans, as Charlie Sheen said, are waking up.
[02:22:14.145 --> 02:22:15.608]  The worm has turned.
[02:22:16.583 --> 02:22:23.809]  And I was talking to Charlie yesterday, and I talked about how when I brought up my facts on 9-11 just days after it happened, a lot of people disagree with me.
[02:22:23.889 --> 02:22:28.232]  Now, not just on my own broadcast, but on so many other shows, really no one calls in to disagree.
[02:22:28.252 --> 02:22:32.556]  Many of you as listeners in your local area have heard me on your local station with a talk show host attacking me.
[02:22:32.996 --> 02:22:34.317]  And everyone calls into my defense.
[02:22:34.637 --> 02:22:37.939]  So people instinctively know that something is wrong.
[02:22:38.439 --> 02:22:39.900]  And 9-11 is just part of that.
[02:22:40.180 --> 02:22:49.225]  We're talking to, of course, a legendary actor, star of screen and, of course, television, poet and writer, you name it, and Charlie Sheen.
[02:22:49.245 --> 02:22:52.107]  Charlie, there's so many facets to 9-11, but what about WTC7?
[02:22:53.520 --> 02:22:54.761]  A little curious, isn't it?
[02:23:13.379 --> 02:23:14.340]  It's a little bit curious.
[02:23:16.361 --> 02:23:26.688]  It just seems odd that an event, something that we all witnessed, because September 11th wasn't the Zapruder Film.
[02:23:27.128 --> 02:23:30.070]  It was the Zapruder Film Festival, okay?
[02:23:30.710 --> 02:23:32.371]  And I think that...
[02:23:34.427 --> 02:23:41.514]  What was the great Hoover quote about the bigger the lie, the easier it is to pass over on people?
[02:23:41.754 --> 02:23:42.015]  Yes.
[02:23:42.655 --> 02:23:43.856]  I mangled it.
[02:23:43.957 --> 02:23:44.657]  I'm paraphrasing.
[02:23:44.677 --> 02:23:47.660]  Hitler had a similar one about the bigger the lie, the more they'll buy it.
[02:23:48.060 --> 02:23:48.361]  Sure.
[02:23:48.441 --> 02:23:48.941]  There you go.
[02:23:49.282 --> 02:23:49.762]  There you go.
[02:23:49.782 --> 02:23:57.009]  Let me just throw out a quote just because we're 20 minutes into this and I'm sure I'm being demonized across the nation by all of the...
[02:23:59.331 --> 02:24:00.873]  People that do that sort of thing.
[02:24:00.893 --> 02:24:04.736]  But people see through the propaganda organs now like they never have before.
[02:24:04.756 --> 02:24:05.577]  Well, good.
[02:24:06.017 --> 02:24:06.297]  Good.
[02:24:06.477 --> 02:24:06.878]  Finally.
[02:24:07.899 --> 02:24:08.899]  There's a couple of quotes here.
[02:24:09.980 --> 02:24:16.086]  The first is, it is unpatriotic not to tell the truth, whether about the president or anyone else.
[02:24:16.886 --> 02:24:24.633]  The second quote from the same gentleman is, that we are to stand by the president, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile,
[02:24:25.151 --> 02:24:27.372]  But is morally treasonable to the American public.
[02:24:27.852 --> 02:24:28.633]  Theodore Roosevelt.
[02:24:29.093 --> 02:24:31.054]  Yes, well, I mean, that's what the Founding Fathers said.
[02:24:31.114 --> 02:24:32.634]  It's our job to be watchdogs.
[02:24:32.654 --> 02:24:37.076]  The Declaration of Independence clearly states that in our seminal founding document.
[02:24:38.057 --> 02:24:38.457]  Absolutely.
[02:24:38.931 --> 02:24:45.317]  Yeah, and we've been coerced away from these founding principles.
[02:24:45.478 --> 02:24:53.366]  We've been told you're either with us or you're with the terrorists, and we've been told never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning 9-11.
[02:24:53.426 --> 02:24:54.747]  Bush said that at the UN.
[02:24:55.207 --> 02:24:55.628]  Yes, he did.
[02:24:56.255 --> 02:24:56.755]  Yes, he did.
[02:24:56.895 --> 02:25:00.897]  That would direct the blame away from those responsible, blah, blah, blah.
[02:25:02.177 --> 02:25:04.258]  Back to Building 7, yeah.
[02:25:04.458 --> 02:25:14.782]  You pointed out in one of your documentaries that in a classic controlled demolition, that they create what's first called a crease, is that correct?
[02:25:14.982 --> 02:25:15.882]  Or a wrinkle?
[02:25:16.862 --> 02:25:19.663]  Crease, wrinkle, cramp, all those are used, yes.
[02:25:19.703 --> 02:25:20.844]  They blow the central column.
[02:25:21.344 --> 02:25:24.325]  Right, and the term pull is about pulling...
[02:25:25.009 --> 02:25:27.510]  The outer walls toward the center of the building, correct?
[02:25:27.630 --> 02:25:27.890]  Yes.
[02:25:29.710 --> 02:25:34.212]  So you minimize the damage, and that way you bring a building down on its own footprint.
[02:25:35.292 --> 02:25:35.632]  Correct.
[02:25:35.852 --> 02:25:40.053]  And many control demolition experts said they've never seen a prettier job than Building 7.
[02:25:40.093 --> 02:25:41.374]  Yeah, gosh.
[02:25:41.534 --> 02:25:45.895]  And there was a guy, I can't remember his name, but scientifically he broke down...
[02:25:46.582 --> 02:25:53.647]  That the building actually fell faster than the speed of gravity because of the explosive vacuum that was created.
[02:25:54.227 --> 02:26:05.695]  Well, a lot of different physicists, a physics professor at BYU, Stephen Jones has done that, Underwriting Laboratories, Kevin Ryan, who was there.
[02:26:05.835 --> 02:26:07.096]  That guy got fired, right?
[02:26:07.296 --> 02:26:09.757]  Yes, he said, we did our own test, and it's impossible.
[02:26:09.797 --> 02:26:12.219]  Steel doesn't melt until thousands of degrees.
[02:26:12.699 --> 02:26:15.641]  Around 3,000 it weakens, and jet fuel burns at 1,200 to 1,400.
[02:26:15.761 --> 02:26:16.881]  It's impossible.
[02:26:17.302 --> 02:26:20.243]  Well, that's 1,200 at optimum conditions, right?
[02:26:20.583 --> 02:26:20.824]  Yes.
[02:26:23.185 --> 02:26:31.189]  Yeah, and then you've got Silverstein, the leaseholder, the owner of 7 as well as the rest of the complex, right?
[02:26:32.630 --> 02:26:34.131]  On tape, on the record...
[02:26:34.844 --> 02:26:35.265]  Same.
[02:26:35.825 --> 02:26:41.350]  We've had such a terrible loss of life that day, and I made the decision that they should go ahead and pull it.
[02:26:41.590 --> 02:26:43.432]  And we gave the order and watched the building come down?
[02:26:43.852 --> 02:26:44.172]  Yeah.
[02:26:45.574 --> 02:26:52.159]  Well, pull is the... I mean, that's as common to the demo world as action and cut to the movie world.
[02:26:52.379 --> 02:27:00.607]  In fact, in the same PBS documentary narrated by Kevin Spacey, or not Kevin Spacey, the other guy, he comes right out and says...
[02:27:02.087 --> 02:27:07.730]  They cut to one of the other engineers demoing a building, and he says we're getting ready to pull it.
[02:27:08.650 --> 02:27:09.271]  And then they pull it.
[02:27:09.291 --> 02:27:16.714]  We're going to come back, in fact, and play some of those clips on the other side of this quick break.
[02:27:16.774 --> 02:27:20.675]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and this is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:20.695 --> 02:27:25.037]  We're talking to Charlie Sheen, and we're very honored to have him.
[02:27:25.097 --> 02:27:28.159]  And, of course, I'm flattered that he likes the documentaries.
[02:27:28.479 --> 02:27:28.879]  Stay with us.
[02:27:35.447 --> 02:27:36.367]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.828 --> 02:27:38.448]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.368 --> 02:27:42.170]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.371 --> 02:27:49.432]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:27:49.652 --> 02:27:53.034]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:27:53.214 --> 02:27:56.695]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:27:56.952 --> 02:28:00.155]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:28:00.175 --> 02:28:05.700]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:28:05.740 --> 02:28:15.369]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:28:15.489 --> 02:28:16.870]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[02:28:16.890 --> 02:28:22.275]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:28:22.771 --> 02:28:27.216]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:28:27.296 --> 02:28:28.657]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:28:28.817 --> 02:28:33.482]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com That toll-free number again?
[02:28:33.502 --> 02:28:33.562]  1-877-928-8822
[02:28:45.234 --> 02:28:47.195]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[02:28:47.295 --> 02:28:57.998]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:28:58.378 --> 02:29:02.900]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:14.304]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:29:14.724 --> 02:29:15.365]  You're good to go.
[02:29:30.041 --> 02:29:40.585]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:29:40.825 --> 02:29:41.626]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:45.527 --> 02:29:49.972]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[02:29:50.252 --> 02:29:53.836]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[02:29:53.976 --> 02:30:02.125]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[02:30:02.365 --> 02:30:07.991]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[02:30:08.291 --> 02:30:13.536]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time, your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[02:30:13.796 --> 02:30:15.878]  This is why you need the filter mag.
[02:30:16.138 --> 02:30:28.310]  The filter mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[02:30:28.530 --> 02:30:32.952]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[02:30:33.172 --> 02:30:34.133]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:30:34.293 --> 02:30:35.934]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[02:30:36.054 --> 02:30:37.834]  That's FilterMag.com.
[02:30:38.095 --> 02:30:39.015]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[02:30:39.055 --> 02:30:41.536]  That's 800-345-8376.
[02:30:41.636 --> 02:30:50.741]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:51.441 --> 02:30:53.742]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:30:57.831 --> 02:31:01.573]  Well, he comes from a family of actors, and he's one of the most accomplished.
[02:31:01.613 --> 02:31:02.734]  He's Charlie Sheen.
[02:31:03.474 --> 02:31:04.515]  They're also activists.
[02:31:06.036 --> 02:31:18.142]  And he has starred in over 65 major films, got a couple new ones coming out this year, and of course he'll be on tonight, 8 o'clock Central Time on CBS for Two and a Half Men, which he is the main star of the show on.
[02:31:18.162 --> 02:31:26.307]  But he joins us today to talk about, well, just the state of the world, and some of the interesting things that are happening, and some of the foundational events that are the
[02:31:27.054 --> 02:31:28.536]  We're good to go.
[02:31:39.818 --> 02:31:41.299]  What's the new definition of freedom?
[02:31:41.379 --> 02:31:43.460]  It's surveillance and not having freedom.
[02:31:43.500 --> 02:31:46.441]  So it's a lot of double speak and double think.
[02:31:46.622 --> 02:31:49.043]  And Charlie Sheen, again, is our guest.
[02:31:49.403 --> 02:31:50.604]  I want to play a clip.
[02:31:50.664 --> 02:31:57.447]  He mentioned this clip from America Rebuilds, a 2002 PBS documentary.
[02:31:57.607 --> 02:31:59.928]  And it is narrated by Kevin Spacey.
[02:32:00.369 --> 02:32:05.231]  And here is Larry Silverstein, the owner, who took out $7 million of insurance on the two towers.
[02:32:05.711 --> 02:32:08.733]  And he's also now bought the Sears Tower and taken out a bunch of insurance and
[02:32:10.134 --> 02:32:16.817]  Governor Pataki just called him the lowest of the low in the newspaper because he's holding out for a billion more now.
[02:32:17.237 --> 02:32:18.118]  Interesting fellow.
[02:32:19.218 --> 02:32:20.279]  Made out quite well.
[02:32:20.499 --> 02:32:23.000]  And here is his statement from America Rebuilds.
[02:32:23.661 --> 02:32:29.944]  I remember getting a call from the fire department commander telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[02:32:29.964 --> 02:32:33.506]  I said, you know, we've had such terrible loss of life.
[02:32:34.580 --> 02:32:36.503]  Maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it.
[02:32:37.906 --> 02:32:39.468]  And they made that decision to pull.
[02:32:39.789 --> 02:32:42.954]  And then we watched the building collapse.
[02:32:43.414 --> 02:32:45.698]  They made the decision to pull.
[02:32:46.239 --> 02:32:46.900]  They made.
[02:32:47.461 --> 02:32:48.663]  They made the decision.
[02:32:49.175 --> 02:32:49.775]  We're good to go.
[02:32:49.795 --> 02:32:50.015]  I think?
[02:33:15.128 --> 02:33:20.011]  Then the crimp in the middle, the top of the building imploding downwards, and then it falls in on itself.
[02:33:21.171 --> 02:33:26.514]  Going back to our guest, Mr. Sheen, that is the clip you mentioned with Mr. Silverstein.
[02:33:26.934 --> 02:33:27.754]  Yes, it is.
[02:33:29.415 --> 02:33:30.976]  Let me just play devil's advocate for a second.
[02:33:34.698 --> 02:33:38.200]  Again, I don't claim to be an expert about structural integrity.
[02:33:38.220 --> 02:33:40.341]  I don't claim to be an expert about demolitions.
[02:33:41.525 --> 02:33:50.460]  Could they have rigged that building during the day when they decided that the fire was out of hand, even though it was only in a couple of floors?
[02:33:50.641 --> 02:33:51.041]  No way.
[02:33:51.061 --> 02:33:52.964]  They could have blown the whole thing to bits.
[02:33:53.941 --> 02:33:59.183]  With just a mass of explosives down low, but they couldn't engage in precision demolitions.
[02:33:59.203 --> 02:33:59.823]  It would take weeks.
[02:34:00.243 --> 02:34:00.844]  Okay, good.
[02:34:01.084 --> 02:34:01.484]  Good to know.
[02:34:01.524 --> 02:34:02.404]  That's what I think.
[02:34:02.644 --> 02:34:07.686]  But, again, I'm just throwing stuff out that somebody might present as a viable argument.
[02:34:07.826 --> 02:34:11.687]  Well, the engineers that have looked at it who weren't on government payroll have said just what you're saying.
[02:34:11.747 --> 02:34:15.969]  The heads of mining colleges, the heads of physics departments, the heads of...
[02:34:16.329 --> 02:34:18.790]  Not much, because it didn't really answer a lot of the hard questions.
[02:34:18.810 --> 02:34:19.450]  Let me ask you, though.
[02:34:19.470 --> 02:34:22.031]  How long did it take to start an investigation after, I don't know, Pearl Harbor?
[02:34:44.853 --> 02:34:45.353]  About a day.
[02:34:45.373 --> 02:34:47.475]  Okay.
[02:34:47.495 --> 02:34:48.075]  The Titanic.
[02:34:49.136 --> 02:34:50.117]  It started that day.
[02:34:51.157 --> 02:34:51.638]  JFK.
[02:34:52.338 --> 02:34:52.998]  Started that day.
[02:34:53.479 --> 02:34:53.699]  Yeah.
[02:34:53.719 --> 02:34:53.919]  9-11?
[02:34:53.939 --> 02:34:54.860]  Started about a year later.
[02:34:54.880 --> 02:34:55.920]  Yeah.
[02:34:58.931 --> 02:35:02.953]  Yeah, and then the investigation was ordered to be limited in its scope?
[02:35:03.453 --> 02:35:12.338]  Well, they had armed guards over every piece of steel and put GPS equipment on each piece, and if a guy pulled over to get a hamburger for ten minutes, he'd be fired and then criminally charged.
[02:35:12.378 --> 02:35:15.499]  That's what they actually did, and they shipped it to China under guard.
[02:35:16.860 --> 02:35:26.185]  Yeah, well, that bothers me because Giuliani, as a former prosecutor, knows the value of evidence preservation and crime scene preservation.
[02:35:27.335 --> 02:35:37.901]  Now, I understand that they were on the clock, and they were still looking for victims, and they were still looking for bodies, and they were still hoping beyond hope that there were survivors, but... But not a week into it, not a month into it.
[02:35:38.481 --> 02:35:39.262]  No, I know.
[02:35:40.042 --> 02:35:40.362]  I know.
[02:35:40.683 --> 02:35:49.788]  So the thing that I can't get my mind off of is that if there's a problem with Building 7, there's a problem with the whole thing.
[02:35:50.623 --> 02:35:51.143]  Well, you're right.
[02:35:51.183 --> 02:35:53.023]  What about firefighters on record?
[02:35:53.083 --> 02:36:00.745]  Major newspapers say they found three of the voice recorders, data recorders, and then the FBI said, don't tell anybody about this, and shipped them off.
[02:36:01.705 --> 02:36:03.825]  Yeah, and we've never had access to that data, have we?
[02:36:04.125 --> 02:36:04.345]  No.
[02:36:05.005 --> 02:36:05.226]  No.
[02:36:06.346 --> 02:36:11.807]  Yeah, just the fact that the entire event is so shrouded in secrecy.
[02:36:11.847 --> 02:36:16.627]  They ordered the FAA to destroy the tapes as well, the tapes they recorded at the towers.
[02:36:18.208 --> 02:36:18.628]  Yeah.
[02:36:21.073 --> 02:36:21.333]  I know.
[02:36:22.874 --> 02:36:27.736]  Again, I'm not coming on your show to say, I know who did it, I know how they did it, and I know why they did it.
[02:36:28.156 --> 02:36:37.660]  I'm just coming on to talk about what we've been told as a public, and again, a lot of it is pretty...
[02:36:41.061 --> 02:36:42.722]  Silly, for lack of a better term.
[02:36:43.502 --> 02:36:45.203]  Something's rotten in the state of Denmark.
[02:36:45.243 --> 02:36:47.044]  We know there hasn't been a real investigation.
[02:36:47.084 --> 02:36:48.304]  In fact, there's been a cover-up.
[02:36:48.784 --> 02:36:51.586]  And when you normally see a cover-up going on, that's pretty suspicious.
[02:36:52.706 --> 02:36:53.407]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:36:53.427 --> 02:36:56.148]  Let me ask you this, though.
[02:36:56.988 --> 02:37:06.572]  Everybody's now familiar with the famous Andrew Card Bush ear whisperer at the elementary school.
[02:37:06.592 --> 02:37:07.093]  Oh, yes.
[02:37:08.783 --> 02:37:16.909]  That whole incident is problematic to me, because as we talked about yesterday, it was broadcast three days in advance, his schedule, correct?
[02:37:16.929 --> 02:37:17.690]  The President's schedule?
[02:37:17.870 --> 02:37:18.150]  Yes, sir.
[02:37:18.750 --> 02:37:24.614]  Yes, so, conservatively, if that event was being broadcast live, right?
[02:37:25.115 --> 02:37:25.315]  Yes.
[02:37:26.396 --> 02:37:31.279]  How many people in the state of Florida knew where the President was at that specific point in time?
[02:37:33.112 --> 02:37:36.095]  Basically, the entire population that watched the TV news.
[02:37:36.135 --> 02:37:36.956]  It was a big event.
[02:37:37.437 --> 02:37:37.757]  Okay.
[02:37:37.877 --> 02:37:38.618]  All right.
[02:37:38.638 --> 02:37:46.306]  So, if, in fact, he was being informed that the second plane had hit, America's under attack, right?
[02:37:46.706 --> 02:37:47.307]  Isn't he then...
[02:37:48.860 --> 02:37:52.961]  Putting everybody in his immediate circle at great risk?
[02:37:53.261 --> 02:37:55.502]  Including that school full of elementary students.
[02:37:55.962 --> 02:37:56.963]  That's what I'm talking about, yeah.
[02:37:57.423 --> 02:38:06.686]  Yeah, so it would seem to me that upon the revelation of that news, that the Secret Service would grab the president and remove him.
[02:38:08.073 --> 02:38:10.714]  As if he were on fire from that room.
[02:38:10.954 --> 02:38:11.554]  Well, you're right.
[02:38:11.614 --> 02:38:15.415]  And he was only about 10 minutes away from a major airport.
[02:38:15.595 --> 02:38:19.035]  And they were saying they thought there were hijackers all over the country.
[02:38:19.075 --> 02:38:21.596]  And everyone's in incredible fear.
[02:38:21.716 --> 02:38:31.278]  But, oh, George Bush, he just sits there after he's told the second plane has hit for around 20 minutes and then kind of just ambles out, taking his time.
[02:38:31.798 --> 02:38:36.744]  Of course, some Secret Service did say, let's get him out, and then Card and others just said, no, we're going to stay.
[02:38:36.784 --> 02:38:37.645]  I wonder what they knew.
[02:38:37.665 --> 02:38:45.094]  You know, it's funny, Jeb Bush declared martial law three days before, too, and that was kind of kept just a little bit quiet as well.
[02:38:45.594 --> 02:38:46.856]  Did Jeb Bush ever explain why?
[02:38:47.476 --> 02:38:50.197]  No, he wouldn't say why, and Bush wouldn't say why.
[02:38:50.217 --> 02:38:53.239]  They had massed 44,000 U.S.
[02:38:53.619 --> 02:39:05.964]  troops, 18,000 British troops in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, and had carrier attack groups about to launch their attacks on Afghanistan, and he had that order signed on his desk just waiting two days before 9-11.
[02:39:06.265 --> 02:39:13.708]  That was incredibly convenient to have your whole military stacked up and ready to go into Afghanistan, something that took about six months to build up, I'm told.
[02:39:14.822 --> 02:39:17.923]  Yeah, because you don't really put those strategies together overnight, do you?
[02:39:18.943 --> 02:39:19.123]  No.
[02:39:19.783 --> 02:39:21.824]  For a major invasion, no.
[02:39:22.504 --> 02:39:25.205]  No, those are really well calculated and really well planned.
[02:39:26.125 --> 02:39:27.125]  At least from this government.
[02:39:28.766 --> 02:39:29.406]  Well, you're right.
[02:39:31.346 --> 02:39:32.387]  But let me ask you this.
[02:39:33.947 --> 02:39:41.689]  In a statement that the president made following, I think it was a school kid that asked him, what did you think when the first plane hit?
[02:39:43.061 --> 02:39:48.984]  And he said something to the effect of, I was watching it on TV like everybody else, and I thought, oh gosh, that's pilot error.
[02:39:49.224 --> 02:39:49.564]  Correct?
[02:39:49.864 --> 02:39:50.164]  Yes.
[02:39:50.785 --> 02:39:55.707]  So, I guess one of the perks of being president is you get access to TV channels.
[02:39:56.391 --> 02:39:58.852]  That don't exist in the known universe, correct?
[02:39:59.333 --> 02:39:59.713]  That's right.
[02:39:59.753 --> 02:40:05.296]  He said, yeah, I saw it on TV, the first plane hit, and I thought, that guy's got to be a terrible pilot.
[02:40:05.396 --> 02:40:12.880]  Then his spokesman, a day later, because the San Francisco Chronicle did the whole timeline, his spokesman said, no, he never saw that, he didn't mean that.
[02:40:13.720 --> 02:40:25.689]  He wasn't even aware the first building had been hit when he went out to give the speech, but then the Times of London and AP had photos of him watching the first tower smoking after it had been announced there in the green room.
[02:40:25.709 --> 02:40:27.230]  So we also have a lot of lying going on.
[02:40:28.411 --> 02:40:28.751]  Yeah.
[02:40:28.911 --> 02:40:40.960]  I mean, it might lead to believe that he'd seen similar images in some type of a rehearsal.
[02:40:43.254 --> 02:40:43.715]  As it were.
[02:40:43.735 --> 02:40:44.415]  Yes.
[02:40:44.896 --> 02:40:45.436]  I don't know.
[02:40:46.096 --> 02:40:54.902]  What did you think of the guns being taken from the pilots just a few months before in July, the federal law being changed by Bush so pilots couldn't carry firearms?
[02:40:55.943 --> 02:40:57.024]  That's a little convenient, isn't it?
[02:40:58.785 --> 02:41:04.269]  Because that was instituted post-Cuban Missile Crisis, correct?
[02:41:04.429 --> 02:41:04.749]  Yes, sir.
[02:41:05.349 --> 02:41:06.991]  Yeah, so that had been in place for almost 40 years.
[02:41:09.763 --> 02:41:16.797]  You know, it's right in there with, I guess it was June or July of 2001, when after 46 years, Cheney changed...
[02:41:20.595 --> 02:41:22.356]  The authorization for the shoot-down orders.
[02:41:22.896 --> 02:41:23.516]  Oh, that's right.
[02:41:23.936 --> 02:41:30.639]  Since NORAD was set up in the late 50s, generals and admirals had standing shoot-down orders of errant aircraft like Payne Stewart.
[02:41:30.659 --> 02:41:32.600]  They were ready in that case a few years before.
[02:41:33.360 --> 02:41:40.443]  But magically, he took the power away from all the generals and only gave it to himself and to his adjunct, the Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld.
[02:41:40.984 --> 02:41:41.244]  Yeah.
[02:41:42.004 --> 02:41:46.506]  Yeah, no, again, you know, I'm not on your show to say...
[02:41:47.358 --> 02:41:48.439]  Who did it or why?
[02:41:48.459 --> 02:41:49.799]  Because I don't have those answers.
[02:41:50.259 --> 02:41:53.861]  Yeah, we just shouldn't have an investigation by their very people that turns out to be a whitewash.
[02:41:53.901 --> 02:42:02.425]  I mean, the 9-11 Commission, we talked yesterday about how the Commission claimed there weren't even support pillars in the middle of Tower 1 and 2 when it had the biggest columns in the world up until that time.
[02:42:03.294 --> 02:42:04.175]  Yeah, it had how many?
[02:42:04.195 --> 02:42:04.175]  47.
[02:42:04.215 --> 02:42:06.977]  47, that's right, yeah.
[02:42:07.397 --> 02:42:23.769]  And it would seem to me, just based on what we've all seen, those images that are indelibly emblazoned into our memories forever, again, I don't have experience in avionics or high-rise mechanics or
[02:42:26.912 --> 02:42:28.254]  Yes, it did.
[02:42:28.334 --> 02:42:28.394]  So...
[02:42:37.671 --> 02:42:51.557]  I have a hard time believing that a fireball traveled down the elevator over 1100 feet and still had the explosive energy to destroy the lobby like it was described.
[02:42:51.957 --> 02:42:59.320]  Well, we can fill a two-hour film just with quick cuts of different firefighters and police saying they saw bombs going off.
[02:42:59.680 --> 02:43:00.161]  We're good to go.
[02:43:19.102 --> 02:43:21.483]  Yeah, and this one guy in that famous clip talks about it.
[02:43:21.503 --> 02:43:25.705]  It looked like one of those, you know, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, controlled detonations.
[02:43:25.765 --> 02:43:26.705]  In fact, we have that clip.
[02:43:26.745 --> 02:43:28.386]  Now, there's two in the computer, John, so be careful.
[02:43:28.486 --> 02:43:30.207]  One hasn't been edited and has the cussing.
[02:43:30.467 --> 02:43:31.107]  Don't air that one.
[02:43:31.127 --> 02:43:31.867]  Be careful.
[02:43:31.927 --> 02:43:33.488]  Last time we almost had a mistake.
[02:43:33.508 --> 02:43:37.770]  Can you find the one where the firefighters are saying, it looked as if they had detonators.
[02:43:37.810 --> 02:43:38.810]  Are you talking about that one?
[02:43:39.270 --> 02:43:40.511]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, yeah.
[02:43:40.911 --> 02:43:48.633]  And then now there are films that have come out, and of course I have all these clips, but there are films that just have an hour and a half of just that, Charlie.
[02:43:49.494 --> 02:43:50.894]  Just different firemen saying that.
[02:43:51.454 --> 02:43:59.276]  Sure, and again, this is not you and I watching the video, speculating about what we think we saw.
[02:43:59.296 --> 02:44:02.757]  These are gentlemen inside the buildings saying,
[02:44:06.016 --> 02:44:09.217]  At the very point of collapse.
[02:44:09.237 --> 02:44:10.477]  Let's go ahead and roll that next clip.
[02:44:10.497 --> 02:44:10.818]  Here it is.
[02:44:11.178 --> 02:44:11.378]  Sure.
[02:44:11.398 --> 02:44:12.198]  We made it outside.
[02:44:12.218 --> 02:44:13.358]  We made it about a block.
[02:44:13.978 --> 02:44:17.779]  We made it at least two blocks, and we started running.
[02:44:17.799 --> 02:44:19.680]  Floor by floor, it started popping out.
[02:44:19.760 --> 02:44:20.400]  It was detonated.
[02:44:20.420 --> 02:44:21.260]  Yeah, detonated.
[02:44:21.400 --> 02:44:22.301]  All the way down.
[02:44:22.321 --> 02:44:23.241]  I was marching and running.
[02:44:23.261 --> 02:44:24.101]  Just ran up west.
[02:44:24.261 --> 02:44:25.862]  And then you just sort of, this cloud of...
[02:44:30.864 --> 02:44:30.904]  So...
[02:44:42.108 --> 02:44:43.929]  Mr. Sheen, what do you think we should do then?
[02:44:43.969 --> 02:44:44.970]  I mean, this is a citizen.
[02:44:45.010 --> 02:44:45.730]  You have that right.
[02:44:46.030 --> 02:44:47.011]  What do you think we should do?
[02:44:47.031 --> 02:44:49.812]  I mean, what type of... What would be a real investigation?
[02:44:49.832 --> 02:45:04.280]  What would satisfy you, who, according to most Americans in major polls, a CNN poll, 90%, a Zobby poll, 49%, take whatever poll you want, but more than half of Americans in major polls want some type of real investigation.
[02:45:04.300 --> 02:45:05.100]  What would you like to see?
[02:45:06.001 --> 02:45:07.141]  I would like to see the same thing.
[02:45:07.181 --> 02:45:08.042]  I think it's got to be...
[02:45:10.402 --> 02:45:17.766]  It's got to be hit by, if this is possible, some neutral investigative committee.
[02:45:20.488 --> 02:45:21.028]  I don't know...
[02:45:22.054 --> 02:45:24.435]  Exactly how to establish that.
[02:45:24.795 --> 02:45:27.455]  Well, the problem is... You would know more about that than I would.
[02:45:27.635 --> 02:45:31.676]  Well, the problem is they tried to, again, appoint Henry Kissinger, and they called him independent.
[02:45:32.136 --> 02:45:36.857]  It was like appointing one of Janet Reno's deputies to investigate Waco and calling it independent.
[02:45:37.297 --> 02:45:38.458]  What would be independent?
[02:45:39.018 --> 02:45:47.280]  Maybe just randomly pick 20 engineers or something and draft them for a committee and then make sure no one tried to intimidate the witnesses?
[02:45:47.300 --> 02:45:49.200]  I mean, maybe just a jury of the peers.
[02:45:50.299 --> 02:45:55.107]  What if we use like retired political foreign nationals?
[02:45:55.588 --> 02:45:58.693]  What if we use experts that don't have any ties whatsoever?
[02:45:59.304 --> 02:46:00.204]  To this administration.
[02:46:00.725 --> 02:46:06.007]  Well, Michael Meacher, number three in the Blair government, says that he believes the government may be behind it.
[02:46:06.387 --> 02:46:10.949]  And then we have Andres von Bulow, the former German defense minister, saying the same thing.
[02:46:11.429 --> 02:46:15.510]  And a bunch of other Russian and other foreign leaders are saying the same thing.
[02:46:15.810 --> 02:46:19.432]  Over 80% of the French public in major polls say our government did it.
[02:46:19.732 --> 02:46:22.953]  So, boy, if we got foreigners to do it, I think they'd come to the same conclusion we have.
[02:46:23.594 --> 02:46:24.074]  Right, right, right.
[02:46:24.094 --> 02:46:27.315]  But I'm just saying as far as people that don't have a stake or don't have an interest or don't,
[02:46:28.740 --> 02:46:30.021]  Oh, I agree with you.
[02:46:30.141 --> 02:46:30.602]  I agree with you.
[02:46:30.622 --> 02:46:32.603]  I'm just saying that they would come to the same conclusion.
[02:46:33.123 --> 02:46:33.483]  Yeah.
[02:46:34.444 --> 02:46:38.326]  Well, I guess in the court of public opinion, I would say that people aren't buying the official story.
[02:46:39.647 --> 02:46:40.207]  No, they're not.
[02:46:40.628 --> 02:46:41.108]  They're not.
[02:46:41.188 --> 02:46:43.469]  And I would place myself in that court.
[02:46:45.090 --> 02:46:47.672]  But, you know, so we've talked about Building 7, right?
[02:46:49.133 --> 02:46:52.615]  And that whole episode really smells a rat.
[02:46:54.056 --> 02:46:57.218]  But then you've got to sort of shift the focus to the Pentagon.
[02:46:58.889 --> 02:46:59.749]  Very suspicious.
[02:47:00.209 --> 02:47:01.830]  You know, are we coming up on a break?
[02:47:01.850 --> 02:47:03.570]  Should we come back to the Pentagon after the break?
[02:47:03.650 --> 02:47:07.931]  Yeah, let's do that after the break, but in the minute and a half or so we've got right now.
[02:47:07.951 --> 02:47:08.571]  Okay.
[02:47:08.591 --> 02:47:11.212]  What about PNAC, Project for a New American Century?
[02:47:11.652 --> 02:47:21.514]  Dick Cheney pens a piece in September 2000 titled Rebuilding America's Defenses, and he says we need a Pearl Harbor event to catalyze the American people.
[02:47:21.994 --> 02:47:22.575]  Yeah.
[02:47:22.615 --> 02:47:23.175]  Coincidence?
[02:47:23.195 --> 02:47:24.096]  We think not.
[02:47:24.116 --> 02:47:26.538]  No, I think, again, it's emblematic of the arrogance of this administration.
[02:47:26.558 --> 02:47:28.379]  Even just that video that was released yesterday,
[02:47:50.367 --> 02:47:58.172]  Last week, I believe, the interview prior to Katrina, and, I mean, it's not like there's, you know, again, supposition.
[02:47:58.352 --> 02:48:01.373]  It's documented quotes on videotape.
[02:48:02.354 --> 02:48:09.498]  And the White House comes out and says, well, you can't really look to that as any, you know, clear-cut example of what we knew.
[02:48:09.698 --> 02:48:11.859]  Yeah, FEMA said it's going to probably destroy the city.
[02:48:11.899 --> 02:48:13.400]  The Houston Chronicle reported that.
[02:48:13.780 --> 02:48:15.101]  Times-Picayune Unit reported it.
[02:48:15.121 --> 02:48:15.761]  Everybody knew.
[02:48:15.781 --> 02:48:17.482]  And then Bush goes off on vacation.
[02:48:18.633 --> 02:48:18.873]  Yeah.
[02:48:19.274 --> 02:48:22.556]  No, again, it is a very arrogant administration.
[02:48:22.596 --> 02:48:24.277]  Well, what about them today?
[02:48:24.998 --> 02:48:28.620]  Mr. Sheen's saying that Iraq's better off and everything's going great.
[02:48:30.261 --> 02:48:31.042]  Yeah.
[02:48:31.522 --> 02:48:35.565]  I don't know that they're talking about the same Iraq that you and I are observing.
[02:48:35.865 --> 02:48:36.446]  I agree with you.
[02:48:36.466 --> 02:48:37.206]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:37.466 --> 02:48:38.327]  Amazing interview.
[02:48:38.387 --> 02:48:40.048]  The conclusion on the other side.
[02:48:46.360 --> 02:48:53.747]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:48:54.028 --> 02:48:58.772]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:48:58.992 --> 02:49:04.638]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:49:04.878 --> 02:49:09.400]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:49:09.620 --> 02:49:16.783]  The cashless society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:49:16.803 --> 02:49:21.325]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.485 --> 02:49:24.006]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:49:24.226 --> 02:49:30.929]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[02:51:44.457 --> 02:51:53.226]  Well, I talked to him during the break, and he has really been a champ, spending a whole hour of his precious time with us.
[02:51:53.266 --> 02:52:00.054]  He's going to leave us in just about four minutes, five minutes, and go work on his TV show today.
[02:52:00.074 --> 02:52:02.817]  Two and a half minutes will be on tonight, 8 o'clock, CBS.
[02:52:03.968 --> 02:52:12.910]  But I was talking to him yesterday, and he talked about some of the folks there where he works, and a story that one of the crew told him, and it meshes with this article out of Knight Ritter today.
[02:52:12.990 --> 02:52:18.391]  Pentagon hired contractors to advise on collecting information on churches, mosques, and other U.S.
[02:52:18.451 --> 02:52:20.032]  sites spying on American citizens.
[02:52:20.052 --> 02:52:20.652]  Here's another one.
[02:52:21.012 --> 02:52:24.093]  Washington Post, advanced workers for Bush impersonated reporters.
[02:52:24.433 --> 02:52:29.054]  They're all over the place posing as reporters, spying on people, and advanced teams doing that.
[02:52:29.774 --> 02:52:32.175]  And they just do this all over the place.
[02:52:33.436 --> 02:52:34.836]  Charlie, your take on that.
[02:52:35.817 --> 02:52:39.018]  Well, yeah, there's a young guy, this young kid at work.
[02:52:39.078 --> 02:52:43.160]  He's from Nigeria, and he's in the production department.
[02:52:45.280 --> 02:52:48.162]  And he sort of overheard a conversation.
[02:52:48.202 --> 02:52:50.283]  I was talking about the events of 9-11 and this and that.
[02:52:50.323 --> 02:52:55.885]  And he said, you know, it was interesting because at the time, he was attending George Washington University in downtown D.C.,
[02:52:57.023 --> 02:53:13.377]  And he said the day after the event that federal teams of what they would describe as trauma counselors came to his school, came to his college, came into the classrooms, and basically told them, you're all in shock.
[02:53:14.158 --> 02:53:18.121]  What we've seen is unlike anything we've ever witnessed.
[02:53:18.581 --> 02:53:19.262]  We understand...
[02:53:19.927 --> 02:53:26.454]  That in moments like this, that your memory, your eyes will play tricks on you in the future.
[02:53:26.974 --> 02:53:28.576]  So if anybody's questioning...
[02:53:30.339 --> 02:53:33.562]  You know, what we're telling you has happened.
[02:53:34.723 --> 02:53:38.366]  Do not believe what you think you know about yesterday.
[02:53:38.666 --> 02:53:44.432]  Basically telling them that here's the story, follow it, have a good day.
[02:53:44.452 --> 02:53:46.213]  I have questions about the Pentagon.
[02:53:46.874 --> 02:53:47.254]  So do you.
[02:53:47.314 --> 02:53:51.098]  Why did they grab hundreds of surveillance camera tapes and declare national security?
[02:53:51.138 --> 02:53:53.680]  Why won't they just show us the footage of what happened?
[02:53:54.799 --> 02:53:57.180]  Show us this incredible maneuvering.
[02:53:57.760 --> 02:53:58.741]  Just show it to us.
[02:53:59.441 --> 02:54:04.103]  Just show us, you know, how this particular plane pulled off these maneuvers.
[02:54:04.243 --> 02:54:05.063]  What was it?
[02:54:05.243 --> 02:54:16.568]  A 270-degree turn at 500 miles an hour, descending 7,000 feet in two and a half minutes, skimming across the treetops the last 500 meters, four feet off the ground.
[02:54:16.588 --> 02:54:24.391]  I have talked to pilots who've flown that very aircraft, that very type, and they say that at 500 and something miles an hour, you cannot fly that low to the ground.
[02:54:25.120 --> 02:54:34.982]  Yeah, no, if that happened, and there are that many cameras on it, you know, I understand in the interest of national security that maybe not release the Pentagon cameras, but what about the Sheraton?
[02:54:35.302 --> 02:54:36.362]  What about the gas station?
[02:54:36.782 --> 02:54:39.163]  What about the Department of Transportation freeway cam?
[02:54:39.503 --> 02:54:42.624]  What about all these shots that had this thing perfectly documented?
[02:54:43.504 --> 02:54:48.785]  Instead, they put out five frames that they claim not to have authorized, correct?
[02:54:49.947 --> 02:54:51.629]  And it doesn't look like a passenger liner.
[02:54:51.649 --> 02:54:54.252]  It looks like some type of small white aircraft or drone.
[02:54:55.513 --> 02:54:56.695]  It's really suspicious.
[02:54:56.875 --> 02:55:04.243]  And then, if you look in the lower left-hand corner at the date stamp, it's September 12th.
[02:55:07.852 --> 02:55:10.875]  It's just... As usual, nothing they say fits.
[02:55:10.995 --> 02:55:12.316]  Nothing at any point.
[02:55:12.456 --> 02:55:14.458]  Everything they say turns out to be a fraud.
[02:55:15.418 --> 02:55:18.581]  Yeah, but the whole thing about, well, the plane disintegrated and this and that.
[02:55:18.681 --> 02:55:26.867]  I don't know what that jet is going to do into a reinforced limestone facade.
[02:55:26.927 --> 02:55:29.389]  But it did disappear like a wicked witch from Waterheader.
[02:55:29.650 --> 02:55:31.231]  It just all went into a 14-foot hole.
[02:55:32.131 --> 02:55:32.711]  Exactly.
[02:55:33.251 --> 02:55:44.455]  But this whole thing about, even if you just take the one statement about the wings folding up, it seems like at that impact velocity, everything is still going the same speed.
[02:55:44.635 --> 02:55:45.575]  You know what?
[02:55:46.075 --> 02:55:55.398]  Mr. Sheen, Charlie Sheen, we've got to get you back up in the near future, and of course you and I are going to be working on something in the near future, and I'm really honored to be collaborating with you, and I want to thank you for joining us.
[02:55:55.858 --> 02:55:57.499]  Closing comments in the last 30 seconds.
[02:55:58.359 --> 02:55:59.540]  Last 30 seconds.
[02:55:59.640 --> 02:56:00.360]  It is up to us.
[02:56:01.087 --> 02:56:02.768]  To reveal the truth.
[02:56:02.808 --> 02:56:05.650]  It is up to us because we owe it to the families.
[02:56:05.690 --> 02:56:06.851]  We owe it to the victims.
[02:56:06.891 --> 02:56:15.857]  We owe it to everybody whose life was drastically altered horrifically that day and forever.
[02:56:16.037 --> 02:56:17.018]  We owe it to them.
[02:56:17.218 --> 02:56:17.558]  We do.
[02:56:17.678 --> 02:56:19.339]  To uncover what happened.
[02:56:19.459 --> 02:56:19.899]  Yes, sir.
[02:56:20.020 --> 02:56:20.600]  Godspeed.
[02:56:20.620 --> 02:56:21.320]  You've got a lot of courage.
[02:56:21.340 --> 02:56:22.021]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:56:24.525 --> 02:56:25.287]  We're good to go.
