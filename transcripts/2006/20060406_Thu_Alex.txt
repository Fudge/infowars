[00:00:05.892 --> 00:00:06.552]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.213 --> 00:00:08.254]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.975 --> 00:00:10.096]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.756 --> 00:00:11.557]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.318 --> 00:00:13.119]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.872 --> 00:00:17.515]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.055 --> 00:00:22.158]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:44.734 --> 00:00:55.796]  Is, of course, one of the creators of Monty Python, and he's made the award-winning film Brazil, a 1984 futuristic, dark, satirical work of art.
[00:00:56.416 --> 00:00:59.197]  And I know that he's aware of the New World Order.
[00:00:59.237 --> 00:01:02.937]  I don't personally know him, but I know some big Hollywood stars that do.
[00:01:04.558 --> 00:01:12.179]  And Terry Gilliam, I guess about 16 years ago, produced a film called Twelve Monkeys.
[00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:36.016]  And I had seen only part of it many, many years ago, and one of the folks here at the office said to me, Hey, this wild professor, Bianca, he sounds like the crazy professor in Twelve Monkeys, who goes around preaching, we've got to save the animals, we've got to get rid of the entire human population, and then he releases it,
[00:01:37.125 --> 00:01:46.528]  And so right now, we got the DVD this morning, and we're going to grab some audio clips from 12 Monkeys and play it in the broadcast today.
[00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:53.271]  And I'm not saying that Professor Dr. Eric Pianca is going to do something like this.
[00:01:53.711 --> 00:01:59.533]  Though we have his speeches, we have his papers, he has said that he wishes 90% of us would die.
[00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:06.232]  And his students report and support him and say that they want 100% dead, but he only wants 90%.
[00:02:06.552 --> 00:02:12.075]  And then he says he and his family are ready, and then he knows he may need to go first with his family.
[00:02:12.375 --> 00:02:13.576]  He's very sad about it.
[00:02:14.677 --> 00:02:22.741]  Well, that's exactly what's in 12 Monkeys, starring Bruce Willis, produced, directed, written by Terry Gilliam.
[00:02:23.618 --> 00:02:26.800]  And of course, Terry Gilliam is fully aware of the New World Order.
[00:02:26.921 --> 00:02:38.169]  Why is it there's a movie made over a decade ago with the exact same type of byline, the exact same script as what these people are spouting?
[00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.773]  Because my father was taught this in 1968, 1969 at the University of Texas as a biology student.
[00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.642]  Paul Watson was taught this in Sheffield, England.
[00:02:54.142 --> 00:03:01.026]  Steve Watson was taught this getting his master's degree in political science in London, England.
[00:03:02.207 --> 00:03:06.029]  I was taught this in the early 1990s at college.
[00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:08.631]  Everyone has been taught this.
[00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:12.333]  Everyone I talk to has been taught this.
[00:03:12.813 --> 00:03:14.894]  And this has all been hidden in plain view.
[00:03:15.034 --> 00:03:16.315]  I commend Terry Gilliam.
[00:03:17.876 --> 00:03:19.677]  What is wrong with me?
[00:03:21.383 --> 00:03:22.964]  I have not spent enough time on this.
[00:03:23.065 --> 00:03:25.446]  Other patriots have spent almost no time.
[00:03:25.687 --> 00:03:27.968]  The truth movement isn't even aware of this.
[00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:31.451]  I've spent a lot of time, but not enough time.
[00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:34.053]  And this Pianca thing is a wake-up call.
[00:03:34.434 --> 00:03:42.040]  Not that he said 90% of us need to die and has an Ebola plush toy and says AIDS isn't killing people fast enough, it needs to accelerate.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.101]  Those are quotes.
[00:03:43.941 --> 00:03:47.084]  And that China's police state is great and one-child policies are great.
[00:03:48.323 --> 00:04:13.969]  The fact that he's backpedaling, the fact that the Associated Press, that the Austin American Statesman, that National NBC, that local NBC, are soft-pedaling his backpedaling and saying he never said any of these things when he has published papers that he has given to International Academy of Sciences, that he has given to the most prestigious...
[00:04:14.645 --> 00:04:22.727]  Organizations, the Royal Scientific Institute in London, the Royal Institutes in Paris, the Royal Institute in Vienna, Austria.
[00:04:23.868 --> 00:04:37.832]  He is prestigious, and he got a 95% standing ovation at Lamar University a month ago, and he got over a 90% standing ovation last weekend at St.
[00:04:37.892 --> 00:04:38.752]  Edward's University.
[00:04:39.633 --> 00:04:41.674]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:06.521]  We're good to go.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.181]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:05:40.587 --> 00:05:42.669]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyrion today.
[00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:45.350]  Call toll free 1-888-253-3139.

[00:05:54.396 --> 00:05:56.377]  You see big brothers afraid of this documentary.
[00:05:56.617 --> 00:05:58.138]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:00.360]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:06:01.576 --> 00:06:03.197]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:06:03.317 --> 00:06:07.419]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:10.441]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:06:10.521 --> 00:06:17.244]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:06:17.424 --> 00:06:20.426]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:06:20.626 --> 00:06:23.007]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:23.147 --> 00:06:27.870]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove
[00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:42.618]  Try Halo Methanes and volatile organic elements such as Aptazine, Benzene, Chloride, and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[00:06:42.778 --> 00:06:49.441]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[00:06:52.363 --> 00:06:52.844]  803-4438 That's 888-803-4438
[00:07:01.989 --> 00:07:05.110]  We understand that decisions related to health can be overwhelming.

[00:07:12.612 --> 00:07:25.975]  For example, did you know that Live52, the top-selling natural herbal supplement for liver diseases since 1930, is backed by over 300 research studies and clinical trials and prescribed by more than 200,000 health professionals worldwide?
[00:07:26.275 --> 00:07:30.016]  In fact, the effectiveness of all the herbs featured on ResearchedHerbs.com
[00:07:30.216 --> 00:07:30.656]  Thank you.
[00:08:01.638 --> 00:08:07.260]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.164 --> 00:08:28.469]  In this science fiction masterpiece, Bruce Willis has set back in time to save the human race from a deadly virus that has forced mankind into the dark underground communities in the future.
[00:08:29.466 --> 00:08:46.821]  Along his travels, he encounters a psychiatrist and a mental patient, brilliantly portrayed by Brad Pitt, who may hold the key to the mysterious rogue group, the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, thought to be responsible for unleashing the killer disease.
[00:08:47.502 --> 00:08:57.030]  Believing he can obtain a pure virus sample in order to find a cure in the future, he is met with one riddle after another that puts him in a race for time.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:05.924]  And in the future, 98% of the world population has been killed, is dead.
[00:09:06.904 --> 00:09:26.194]  And there are the subterranean elite bubble cities, where there's just a few million people left, and they are sending condemned prisoners back in time, and prisoner after prisoner dies going back, trying to find out exactly who is going to release the deadly bioweapon.
[00:09:28.334 --> 00:09:30.696]  And finally Bruce Willis discovers it.
[00:09:30.736 --> 00:09:33.078]  It's not like I'm killing the plot of a film.
[00:09:33.158 --> 00:09:39.082]  This came out, oh it normally says what year it was released.
[00:09:40.583 --> 00:09:41.884]  But I know it came out in the early 1990s.
[00:09:41.904 --> 00:09:41.884]  1995.
[00:09:41.964 --> 00:09:45.486]  And again, I've just seen bits and pieces of it.
[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:52.863]  You know how you see bits and pieces of a movie over the years when you're surfing around on television and you never see the whole thing?
[00:09:52.923 --> 00:09:53.964]  I've actually seen most of it.
[00:09:54.184 --> 00:09:56.526]  But I've talked to my staff here and they've seen it.
[00:09:56.546 --> 00:09:59.628]  We've now got the DVD and we're going to grab some clips for you today.
[00:10:02.779 --> 00:10:08.743]  There's actually a kind of a little local nutty environmental group that wants to release all the animals.
[00:10:08.803 --> 00:10:16.428]  Kind of a nutty little gang called the 12 Monkeys who are kind of like these crazy animal rights activists who want to release all the animals out of the zoo.
[00:10:16.808 --> 00:10:22.792]  And so in the future they only have fragments of this because everybody on earth, 98%, are killed in a two week period.
[00:10:23.312 --> 00:10:30.234]  But it isn't really the little local environmental activist gang that wants to release the animals that caused it.
[00:10:30.694 --> 00:10:31.654]  It is a professor.
[00:10:31.754 --> 00:10:42.317]  And throughout the film, Bruce Willis is running around in our present time, and it's set in the 2000s, early 2000s.
[00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:44.558]  He's running around.
[00:10:44.638 --> 00:10:50.820]  So when they made this back in the mid-90s, I guess, to be accurate, about 12 years ago,
[00:10:52.623 --> 00:11:03.127]  When they made this film, they set it in the near future, which is actually right around today, I'm told by... I didn't know that most of my staff are huge fans of 12 Monkeys and know everything about it.
[00:11:03.147 --> 00:11:03.927]  They're aficionados.
[00:11:03.967 --> 00:11:04.347]  I'm not.
[00:11:04.807 --> 00:11:07.308]  Believe me, I'll be watching it in its entirety as soon as I get a chance.
[00:11:07.348 --> 00:11:08.889]  I just work so much, I really don't have time.
[00:11:08.909 --> 00:11:11.890]  Unless I steal some sleep for myself, which I may do.
[00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:13.090]  I may watch it at midnight tonight.
[00:11:13.951 --> 00:11:17.372]  But you can go out, obviously, and get it from Netflix or rent it at the store or whatever.
[00:11:18.392 --> 00:11:18.792]  Or buy it.
[00:11:18.812 --> 00:11:19.713]  That's what we did.
[00:11:19.733 --> 00:11:20.793]  We went to Best Buy and bought it.
[00:11:21.861 --> 00:11:22.961]  Why am I getting into those details?
[00:11:22.981 --> 00:11:23.442]  It doesn't matter.
[00:11:23.462 --> 00:11:24.322]  Let me start over.
[00:11:25.702 --> 00:11:29.984]  So he's thinking it's this gang, the Twelve Monkeys, the army of the Twelve Monkeys.
[00:11:30.344 --> 00:11:30.984]  And it isn't really.
[00:11:31.004 --> 00:11:38.246]  And the whole time, in plain view, when he's at shopping malls or he's in the street, there's this professor going, We're killing the earth!
[00:11:38.546 --> 00:11:40.727]  We're a bacterial scourge!
[00:11:41.127 --> 00:11:44.488]  We've got to get rid of the human population for the animals.
[00:11:44.889 --> 00:11:46.509]  It's got to be done.
[00:11:46.589 --> 00:11:47.530]  It's loving.
[00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.831]  If we love the earth, we must die.
[00:11:49.871 --> 00:11:54.153]  And then he goes around with the ampule of a deadly virus blowing in people's faces.
[00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:54.753]  Here, my dear.
[00:11:55.273 --> 00:11:55.973]  Oh, there you go.
[00:11:56.233 --> 00:11:57.834]  Now you'll be feeling much better.
[00:11:57.854 --> 00:12:01.976]  And then it kills 98% of the world's population.
[00:12:03.236 --> 00:12:07.118]  And it's got Brad Pitt and, of course, Bruce Willis as the star in this film.
[00:12:09.344 --> 00:12:11.466]  And Madeline Stone as well.
[00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:14.768]  So, we'll be playing some clips of this as soon as they get it ready.
[00:12:14.788 --> 00:12:18.790]  They're in there hurriedly, greedily, grabbing clips out of it right now.
[00:12:20.071 --> 00:12:23.433]  Because we face this in reality.
[00:12:24.674 --> 00:12:29.357]  But the problem is, is it's not one nutty scientist that wants to do it.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:42.929]  And of course, if it does happen, it's going to be blamed on nutty professors and nutty scientists and these little cloistered on the academic reservation fruitcakes.
[00:12:43.009 --> 00:12:59.882]  I mean, if you watched Dr. Pianca on MSNBC with Tucker Carlson, as I watched a tape of it yesterday, he was on two nights ago, he shows all of the telltale body language signs of being completely...
[00:13:00.589 --> 00:13:02.530]  Totally out to lunch.
[00:13:04.392 --> 00:13:04.672]  No.
[00:13:06.513 --> 00:13:14.099]  Oh, by the way, the Estatesman reported yesterday that he was going to receive a visit from the Federal Bureau of Investigations last night.
[00:13:14.119 --> 00:13:21.284]  And now I'm told that it's in the news that he did indeed visit with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
[00:13:21.324 --> 00:13:22.425]  And I have that here in front of me.
[00:13:22.645 --> 00:13:24.106]  So we'll be getting into that later.
[00:13:25.106 --> 00:13:31.009]  But again, there's so many facets to this, I'm chomping at the bit, really thinking about what angle to start with first.
[00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:38.332]  Yesterday, I did one of the most important hours of radio broadcast I've ever done in the first hour.
[00:13:38.352 --> 00:13:53.398]  If you missed it, you need to get a tape of it, or a DVD of it, or a CD of it, or you need to get your hands on it, because I laid out the Elite Master Plan for Control, how they're going to do it, why they're going to do it, how they do plan to exterminate at least 80% of us in the very near future.
[00:13:54.153 --> 00:14:01.137]  Now, I know a lot of you laughed at me when I said they're going to attack the World Trade Center and Bin Laden will take the blame as a CIA asset two months before 9-11.
[00:14:02.118 --> 00:14:05.340]  And I should call the White House and tell them, please don't attack the towers.
[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.742]  Did it on TV, did it on radio, never done it since.
[00:14:09.782 --> 00:14:11.803]  I had never done it before.
[00:14:11.823 --> 00:14:13.724]  I don't just shoot my mouth off.
[00:14:13.744 --> 00:14:21.428]  And I don't believe they're going to hit us with a bioweapon in the next two months, as I said they would do back in mid-2001 in the summer.
[00:14:21.548 --> 00:14:24.770]  July 25th, I launched Operation Expose the Government Terrorist.
[00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:26.071]  We're good to go.
[00:14:47.065 --> 00:14:51.786]  Because every live show I do, we make a tape of it live, and I turn it in as I leave.
[00:14:52.267 --> 00:14:56.568]  I drop it in the drop box to randomly what they call float at the cable station.
[00:14:56.808 --> 00:14:59.389]  That's whenever they want some filler or want to play something.
[00:14:59.409 --> 00:15:00.769]  I don't ask for a specific show time.
[00:15:00.829 --> 00:15:03.650]  I just say float it, and it plays ten times in the next year.
[00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:06.171]  Every five weeks or so, it airs again.
[00:15:07.305 --> 00:15:13.007]  And on the afternoon of 9-11 at 2 o'clock, a two-hour live show I'd done weeks before re-aired.
[00:15:13.788 --> 00:15:18.610]  And we normally get maybe one call out of a hundred that disagrees with us on the comment line.
[00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:21.551]  We got about 25 calls, many of them death threats.
[00:15:22.271 --> 00:15:26.253]  How dare you say the government attacked the World Trade Center?
[00:15:26.493 --> 00:15:27.953]  How dare you say this?
[00:15:27.973 --> 00:15:36.817]  Of course, they weren't looking at the date on the tape, which we always time-stamp the tapes throughout the broadcast, that it had been said two months before.
[00:15:37.478 --> 00:15:40.359]  Then later people figured out I got a lot of calls and a lot of apologies.
[00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:43.740]  And I got a lot of stations that were 9-11 that freaked out.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:49.162]  And there's even websites saying I'm psychic online and that I'm some kind of Nostradamus.
[00:15:49.682 --> 00:15:50.702]  No, I'm not.
[00:15:50.902 --> 00:15:51.343]  Okay?
[00:15:52.123 --> 00:15:54.064]  This is called deep analysis.
[00:15:54.524 --> 00:15:56.184]  This is called deep research.
[00:15:56.704 --> 00:15:59.665]  Last night, I was up there video editing until 11.
[00:16:00.286 --> 00:16:01.826]  And my editor said he was tired.
[00:16:01.846 --> 00:16:02.306]  He left.
[00:16:02.846 --> 00:16:04.407]  And I left here at 2 a.m.
[00:16:05.794 --> 00:16:08.716]  And drove home and then got up at about 8.30 this morning.
[00:16:08.736 --> 00:16:10.818]  That's why I'm not properly prepared because I had to get some sleep.
[00:16:12.539 --> 00:16:13.780]  And I'm not tooting my horn.
[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:21.686]  I want to explain to you that I get up here and have this shotgun approach because there's so much data, I can't even begin to warn you.
[00:16:22.446 --> 00:16:34.475]  Every indicator, every piece of information I have, I'm a good analyst, excellent analyst, and we've had top analysts on this broadcast, will tell you the highest form of intelligence, and I don't mean...
[00:16:35.399 --> 00:16:38.662]  I have the highest form of native intelligence or IQ or brain power.
[00:16:38.882 --> 00:16:41.764]  No, I mean IE intelligence work.
[00:16:42.105 --> 00:16:47.169]  The highest form of intelligence work is prediction and projection.
[00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.181]  Prediction and projection.
[00:16:51.482 --> 00:16:52.683]  Predicting events.
[00:16:53.063 --> 00:17:00.269]  And no one can say, and I've been told by a lot of top analysts, that I have innate analyst skills of the highest order.
[00:17:00.709 --> 00:17:04.012]  And I don't think that's something that we need to poo-poo.
[00:17:04.392 --> 00:17:07.055]  I'm not here bragging or shooting my mouth off.
[00:17:07.235 --> 00:17:08.336]  It is very humbling.
[00:17:08.916 --> 00:17:16.663]  And that's why I work so hard, because I realize I have a responsibility, because I understand the enemy program, to try to warn you.
[00:17:17.901 --> 00:17:19.183]  Now, I am upset.
[00:17:19.323 --> 00:17:20.765]  I am concerned for my family.
[00:17:21.446 --> 00:17:24.870]  I know we're going to wake up one day with people dropping dead all around us.
[00:17:25.371 --> 00:17:26.532]  It could be sooner than later.
[00:17:27.053 --> 00:17:29.857]  And I know these bastards are going to go into their underground bunkers.
[00:17:29.877 --> 00:17:32.280]  We've got the biggest in the world here in the U.S.
[00:17:32.981 --> 00:17:35.204]  And it's going to be bad.
[00:17:36.317 --> 00:17:39.458]  But I believe there's going to be a prelude to that.
[00:17:39.518 --> 00:17:48.220]  I believe there's going to be a warm-up, perhaps as many as three warm-ups, with biological releases around the world that will kill tens of thousands.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:49.700]  Then that will train us to be herded.
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:50.781]  Then millions.
[00:17:51.181 --> 00:17:53.321]  The next wave could even kill tens of millions.
[00:17:53.821 --> 00:17:59.863]  And then it might be ten years after that that the aircraft take off and hit every major city with nerve gas.
[00:18:00.163 --> 00:18:04.424]  I don't believe they'll actually use a super weapon that has a 90-plus percent or higher kill rate.
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.241]  That's not their desire.
[00:18:09.082 --> 00:18:12.444]  The main papers I've read, the establishment plans to kill 80%.
[00:18:13.824 --> 00:18:27.331]  So 20% of us in certain areas will be allowed to live, just we're going to be under a great yoke of tyranny, and these eugenics-minded, obsessed control freaks are going to do it.
[00:18:28.291 --> 00:18:29.131]  There's no debating it.
[00:18:29.712 --> 00:18:30.872]  There's no discussing it.
[00:18:31.613 --> 00:18:32.353]  I guarantee it.
[00:18:33.594 --> 00:18:34.414]  Unless we stop them.
[00:18:34.944 --> 00:18:40.906]  Unless we have a huge understanding about this, unless we discuss it, unless we talk about it, unless we face it.
[00:18:41.286 --> 00:19:00.912]  If you do not face the facts, if you do not face the reality, if you do not face the people we have running this government that radiate 110,000 children, that give black men syphilis, that nerve gas our own troops' intestines, that use hundreds of thousands of tons of uranium, DU all over the planet,
[00:19:01.701 --> 00:19:15.987]  If you do not face their mentality and learn their M.O., and learn their criminology, and learn what these serial killers do, and if you do not face that they're in control, we have psychopathic genius killers in control right now.
[00:19:18.247 --> 00:19:24.590]  And if you do not face that and then look at everything through that lens, you will not see clearly.
[00:19:26.664 --> 00:19:30.647]  And I have tried from every angle to break down my analysis, to disprove it.
[00:19:31.808 --> 00:19:33.489]  I struggle with my analysis.
[00:19:34.129 --> 00:19:40.073]  And I'm telling you that it has a 95% accuracy rate.
[00:19:41.014 --> 00:19:47.899]  I'm telling you that it is a very small chance that my analysis is incorrect.
[00:19:51.141 --> 00:19:53.503]  Now, listen to me now instead of later.
[00:19:54.381 --> 00:19:56.843]  Listen to me very carefully.
[00:19:57.164 --> 00:19:58.565]  When we get back, I'm going to lay it out.
[00:20:01.628 --> 00:20:07.633]  So you take care of your car, you change the oil, tune it up on a regular basis, and always make sure that it's running at its best.

[00:23:02.159 --> 00:23:04.240]  Gee, honey, those new sandals look great on you.
[00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:06.681]  And look, they show off my new toenails, too.
[00:23:06.981 --> 00:23:07.661]  New toenails?
[00:23:08.042 --> 00:23:09.042]  What happened to the old ones?
[00:23:10.022 --> 00:23:12.704]  Well, they're not really new, just clear and healthy looking.
[00:23:13.244 --> 00:23:14.665]  Remember how embarrassed I was?
[00:23:14.685 --> 00:23:17.466]  They were so discolored, really awful looking.
[00:23:17.706 --> 00:23:19.066]  Well, they sure look clear now.
[00:23:19.086 --> 00:23:21.187]  Gosh, I wish I could wear sandals again.
[00:23:21.347 --> 00:23:22.708]  My toenails are a disaster.
[00:23:22.768 --> 00:23:25.569]  Look, this one looks white, and that one's thick and yellow.
[00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:26.990]  Well, here's my secret.
[00:23:27.581 --> 00:23:28.622]  Non-X Nail Gel.

[00:23:48.503 --> 00:23:49.925]  Thanks to Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:23:50.385 --> 00:23:53.386]  Nunnex Nail Gel for clear, healthy-looking nails.
[00:23:53.746 --> 00:24:00.127]  Now at Walgreens, Rite Aid, Eckerd, Brooks, Longs, Duane Reade, and Walmart in the foot care section.
[00:24:00.648 --> 00:24:05.749]  We don't need no education.
[00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:14.631]  We don't need no thought control.
[00:24:19.682 --> 00:24:27.946]  No dark sarcasms in the classrooms Teacher, leave them kids alone Hey!
[00:24:28.026 --> 00:24:29.987]  Teacher!
[00:24:30.047 --> 00:24:34.190]  Leave them kids alone!
[00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:37.791]  Welcome back!
[00:24:48.906 --> 00:24:50.167]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:24:50.808 --> 00:24:58.274]  You see, I began studying the New World Order about 15 years ago, got on air about 12 years ago, and I've just been learning ever since.
[00:24:58.654 --> 00:25:06.841]  And I understand their paradigm, I understand their program, I've read thousands of their own documents and their own foundational thesis that they put out.
[00:25:07.681 --> 00:25:14.167]  And the entire grid they're putting in place is an execution grid, is an extermination control system.
[00:25:14.847 --> 00:25:15.588]  It's a bear trap.
[00:25:16.906 --> 00:25:23.048]  And then you read their plans, and they say that they're going to use plagues and race-specific bioweapons.
[00:25:23.568 --> 00:25:32.690]  You understand the Vice President in the September 2000, September 20, 2000, Rebuilding America's Defenses, London Guardian even picked it up and reported on it.
[00:25:33.871 --> 00:25:36.972]  You can go to PNAC's website, Project for an American Century.
[00:25:36.992 --> 00:25:37.852]  This is just one of hundreds.
[00:25:38.613 --> 00:25:41.334]  Where they say they want to kill certain races.
[00:25:41.414 --> 00:25:46.976]  They want to, quote, use the media to legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons.
[00:25:47.636 --> 00:25:54.538]  Dick Cheney, we need to use our friends in the media to legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons in upcoming conflicts.
[00:25:55.996 --> 00:26:01.040]  Then it just came out a few days ago that CBS, TV, and ABC and others get these memos.
[00:26:01.361 --> 00:26:12.290]  Dozens and dozens of them have been reported on, where the White House, we have them now, is saying, we'd like to see this, we'd like to see that, this is how you support the war, we want reports along these lines, and then those exact reports are put out.
[00:26:13.311 --> 00:26:14.472]  I mean, we're in deep trouble.
[00:26:15.292 --> 00:26:17.254]  Deep, deep, deep, deep trouble.
[00:26:17.294 --> 00:26:23.980]  Why did Terry Gilliam, who's anti-New World Order, anti-police state, made many films about it, why did he make the Twelve Monkeys...
[00:26:24.961 --> 00:26:26.282]  I guess now 12 years ago, 1995.
[00:26:28.323 --> 00:26:30.604]  Why 11 and a half years ago?
[00:26:30.744 --> 00:26:37.948]  Why did he make a film where a crazy scientist releases a bioweapon who wants to kill the entire population?
[00:26:38.268 --> 00:26:39.929]  Because that's what they say.
[00:26:40.049 --> 00:26:40.829]  That's the norm.
[00:26:40.869 --> 00:26:44.411]  The story here is that he gets standing ovations by 95%.
[00:26:45.151 --> 00:26:48.853]  The story here is that NBC locally covers up for him and lies.
[00:26:49.193 --> 00:26:56.839]  The story is the statesman does this whole thing about how great he is and his family and how he's a falconer and how he's a wonderful person.
[00:26:56.859 --> 00:27:00.642]  I've never seen such a sappy, sappy piece of trash.
[00:27:01.562 --> 00:27:04.985]  Such a sappy, glowing sandbag story.
[00:27:06.445 --> 00:27:10.548]  Because this is what they talk about at their tea parties.
[00:27:10.568 --> 00:27:12.969]  This is what they talk about at their cocktail parties.
[00:27:13.509 --> 00:27:33.922]  If you get involved in high society, that is the minions that think they're in high society, you go after a symposium or after a speech put on at some institute or university affair, and you go to have some hors d'oeuvres, this is all they talk about.
[00:27:35.146 --> 00:27:53.151]  You know, I have friends, and I've talked about it, and there's other people I know who've experienced the same thing, where you've got three or four children at the shopping mall, three or four children at one of these organic Austin grocery stores, and the people will walk over, sometimes multiple times while you're in the grocery store, and say, you shouldn't have that many children.
[00:27:53.431 --> 00:27:54.811]  They're everywhere.
[00:27:56.115 --> 00:27:56.835]  They're everywhere.
[00:27:56.855 --> 00:27:59.897]  And the same people will go, it's horrible that Bush is killing Iraqis.
[00:28:00.397 --> 00:28:01.557]  He's hurting the people.
[00:28:01.577 --> 00:28:04.879]  He's evil, but oh, we need everyone to die, though.
[00:28:04.899 --> 00:28:09.320]  And Alex, why are you saying that Dr. Bianca's bad?
[00:28:09.861 --> 00:28:10.861]  I'm one of his students.
[00:28:10.941 --> 00:28:12.602]  I believe that all humans should go.
[00:28:13.182 --> 00:28:14.863]  But don't say he's against life.
[00:28:14.923 --> 00:28:16.843]  It's for the earth he wants this to happen.
[00:28:17.184 --> 00:28:18.564]  Don't compare him to Hitler.
[00:28:18.844 --> 00:28:20.545]  How could you possibly do that?
[00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:24.532]  Of course, everyone knows that humans are bad.
[00:28:25.053 --> 00:28:29.096]  Why, you're some type of weirdo because you don't want everyone to die.
[00:28:29.116 --> 00:28:31.258]  I mean, I've read these letters on air.
[00:28:31.278 --> 00:28:35.121]  His daughter emails us in post.
[00:28:35.141 --> 00:28:40.625]  Our MySpace account is saying, and we're trying to get her on, saying, well, I know it's hard for you to understand.
[00:28:41.006 --> 00:28:42.827]  Oh, yes, you just can't grasp it.
[00:28:43.287 --> 00:28:44.328]  Pat me on the head.
[00:28:44.428 --> 00:28:46.890]  I can't intellectually grasp it.
[00:28:47.371 --> 00:28:49.833]  You see, they just don't understand.
[00:28:50.573 --> 00:28:54.477]  P. Unca got real sad on NBC, and he just said, I'm just trying to word people.
[00:28:54.878 --> 00:29:02.225]  Well, that's why he said at the start of his speech, at both speeches in Austin and at Lamar University outside Austin, that's why he said, turn your cameras off.
[00:29:02.285 --> 00:29:03.286]  No taping allowed.
[00:29:03.486 --> 00:29:04.968]  The people aren't ready to hear this.
[00:29:04.988 --> 00:29:07.030]  90% need to die.
[00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:08.191]  It needs to start now.
[00:29:08.471 --> 00:29:10.033]  China's got a great police state.
[00:29:11.972 --> 00:29:13.153]  Our genetics are getting bad.
[00:29:13.173 --> 00:29:15.854]  Our IQ is dropping because we have too many children.
[00:29:15.874 --> 00:29:16.975]  It's all eugenics.
[00:29:17.435 --> 00:29:20.757]  You can name it whatever you want, but you can't put perfume on a pig.
[00:29:20.957 --> 00:29:25.260]  You can put it on a pig, but you... You can put perfume on the pig, but you can't take the pig out of the pig.
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:30.382]  So when we get back, I will get into the elites' plan more.
[00:29:30.402 --> 00:29:32.023]  We'll get into the latest developments.
[00:29:32.043 --> 00:29:34.125]  You've got a visit from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
[00:29:34.405 --> 00:29:36.546]  And I'm sure these local officers are great guys.
[00:29:36.586 --> 00:29:38.267]  I've never said that there aren't good people in the government.
[00:29:39.048 --> 00:29:44.610]  But imagine if those officers knew, if they read, that their bosses are advocating this.
[00:29:45.431 --> 00:29:46.511]  We need to educate them.
[00:29:46.851 --> 00:29:48.292]  See, that's our job.
[00:29:49.352 --> 00:29:50.833]  But good job to the FBI.
[00:29:52.013 --> 00:29:52.934]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.394 --> 00:29:54.994]  The Empire's on the run.

[00:32:01.469 --> 00:32:04.132]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:32:04.392 --> 00:32:11.561]  Did you know that one of the 45 points of international communism to capture America was to gain control of one or both political parties?
[00:32:12.412 --> 00:32:17.014]  Have you noticed that it doesn't matter which political party, Republican or Democrat, takes office?
[00:32:17.234 --> 00:32:25.597]  We continue in the same direction of losing our freedoms and ultimately our national sovereignty to the United Nations, which is a communist organization.
[00:32:26.418 --> 00:32:27.918]  The handwriting is on the wall.
[00:32:28.499 --> 00:32:36.582]  We would like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:33:29.216 --> 00:33:29.937]  Welcome back.
[00:33:32.879 --> 00:33:41.285]  Glad you joined us today as we defend humanity, as we defend our destiny, as we resist the control freaks that are in our society.
[00:33:41.325 --> 00:33:42.125]  Let me break this down.
[00:33:43.206 --> 00:33:46.228]  Humans are first and foremost a predator species.
[00:33:46.889 --> 00:33:50.791]  By every yardstick, we are the masters of the planet.
[00:33:51.932 --> 00:33:58.437]  We are light years ahead in intelligence, and in many cases in physical prowess.
[00:33:59.973 --> 00:34:05.274]  And in our communal efforts to build societies and to construct technological marvels.
[00:34:06.274 --> 00:34:12.996]  And we have not even begun to scratch the surface to learn our destiny and what we are capable of.
[00:34:14.756 --> 00:34:24.618]  And as predator societies, as predator hunter-gatherers, thousands and thousands of years before Christ walked the earth,
[00:34:25.976 --> 00:34:31.442]  We began to congregate in agrarian societies by planting food crops.
[00:34:32.325 --> 00:34:40.749]  Allowing our populations to expand and concentrate and allowing leisure time to begin to expand.
[00:34:41.369 --> 00:34:49.453]  Then the sciences began to develop simultaneously with more complex religious beliefs and ruling elites then emerged.
[00:34:49.913 --> 00:35:00.238]  You would have the twin tribal chieftain whose forefathers were the best warriors against the neighboring tribes and the best at leading the band on the hunt.
[00:35:00.818 --> 00:35:15.587]  They then became ensconced in small tribal towns and then cities, and then you had the twin power structure of the scientist, but most of the scientist information was tied up in shamanistic religion.
[00:35:15.647 --> 00:35:16.868]  They were superstitious.
[00:35:17.368 --> 00:35:18.969]  Subtitles by the Amara.org community
[00:35:36.903 --> 00:35:37.983]  And this is the Illuminati.
[00:35:38.023 --> 00:35:39.143]  This is the New World Order.
[00:35:39.483 --> 00:35:43.024]  It is the knowledge of... They have the systems.
[00:35:43.124 --> 00:35:44.724]  They understand the knowledge.
[00:35:44.784 --> 00:35:49.805]  They understand the power of not letting the general population be educated or informed.
[00:35:50.406 --> 00:35:55.146]  And they understand what the magician or the carnival-barking carny understands.
[00:35:55.486 --> 00:36:03.448]  The sleight of hand, the trick, the mumbo-jumbo, the scam to confound and confuse the population and to con them.
[00:36:04.128 --> 00:36:18.199]  So really what happened early in our development is con artists were able to abuse the sciences of medicine that had been developed and the science of growing food plants.
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.301]  And they were able to leverage that control.
[00:36:21.381 --> 00:36:22.942]  And then their children became decadent.
[00:36:22.982 --> 00:36:24.744]  Their children became corrupt and decadent.
[00:36:24.764 --> 00:36:29.247]  Their children became totally psychopathic, control freak murderers.
[00:36:29.547 --> 00:36:32.630]  Human sacrifice began as a mode of social control.
[00:36:33.889 --> 00:36:42.394]  Wars became an implement of conquest so that the ruling shaman class of kings could then expand their empires.
[00:36:43.134 --> 00:36:44.975]  And then we come into the modern age.
[00:36:46.276 --> 00:36:50.238]  And so what we have is a sub-derivation of the human species.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:37:15.494]  Literally an inbred guild, and you see these guilds all over the world, a dominant ruling class who genetically now, because they have been breeding with each other, they tend to inbreed, and then of course through nurture, through the silver spoon in their mouths for thousands of years, see us as lower than cattle.
[00:37:15.994 --> 00:37:17.695]  See us as totally worthless.
[00:37:17.735 --> 00:37:21.857]  See us as the equivalent of cordwood being thrown into a wood stove.
[00:37:22.297 --> 00:37:27.900]  That see us as the equivalent of a package of hamburger meat at Safeway in the meat section.
[00:37:28.181 --> 00:37:32.943]  That see us as a bag of potato chips or as a Coca-Cola to be slurped down.
[00:37:33.163 --> 00:37:34.604]  We're human resources.
[00:37:35.405 --> 00:37:39.287]  And they practice using up our lives.
[00:37:39.307 --> 00:37:40.728]  They practice using us.
[00:37:40.768 --> 00:37:43.129]  They practice treating us like cattle.
[00:37:43.469 --> 00:37:54.955]  And they practice developing substrata elites that serve them, that have different ideologies with the same end in mind, dehumanization and lowering the value of human life.
[00:37:55.396 --> 00:37:56.776]  The Nazis and eugenics.
[00:37:56.856 --> 00:37:58.057]  Eugenics in this country.
[00:37:59.401 --> 00:38:01.082]  Religious wars of the past.
[00:38:01.422 --> 00:38:14.088]  And now today, something we've now coined, something I put in an article yesterday that I wrote with Paul Watson, that I would not call Dr. Eric Pianca a classical...
[00:38:15.487 --> 00:38:18.428]  Eugenics supporter, or eugenicist.
[00:38:19.248 --> 00:38:39.654]  I would classify him, and I coin several terms, and you can, I'm sure, coin better ones than I, together with our combined intellect, you the listeners, all of us brainstorming, we can come up with better terms, I'd like to ask the callers what you'd like to call it, but there's several different terms, and simply put, it is a type of
[00:38:41.059 --> 00:39:02.234]  Not racial hygiene that was the hallmark and the cornerstone, the central plank to the American-British-Malthusian-slash-Nazi eugenics where certain humans are a disease and we need to purify the human gene pool and create the superman.
[00:39:02.554 --> 00:39:04.175]  That is classical eugenics.
[00:39:04.596 --> 00:39:07.618]  But what Dr. Pianca and the current Rockefeller-endowed scientists
[00:39:09.099 --> 00:39:16.504]  Universities are pushing is a type of global environmental eugenics where humans are the disease.
[00:39:17.124 --> 00:39:24.349]  And so I guess you could call it a zoological eugenics or an ecological eugenics.
[00:39:24.549 --> 00:39:31.134]  I mean, there's so many different terms that can be used, but this is what the Pionkians, and he certainly doesn't deserve it,
[00:39:31.714 --> 00:39:50.281]  I'll be known as the father of this movement, but so many times someone who comes along and gets attention in a movement is then known as the father of it, when the father of this is the emperor kings of thousands of years ago who engaged in warfare against the substratus of the population.
[00:39:50.961 --> 00:39:54.323]  It's class warfare by the elite against the general population.
[00:39:56.123 --> 00:39:57.624]  And that's really what's happening.
[00:39:57.844 --> 00:39:59.925]  And so they have created an army
[00:40:01.065 --> 00:40:17.833]  Of individuals who believe human life is absolutely worthless and needs to be exterminated, and that a ruling class needs to divide up the resources and partition and herd people onto small, tiny, compact city reservations.
[00:40:17.873 --> 00:40:19.634]  And by the way, I knew I'd find it there.
[00:40:19.674 --> 00:40:20.695]  Pianca's written papers.
[00:40:21.535 --> 00:40:28.560]  I think the exact term he uses for the details of partitioning human populations and uses some other terms like that.
[00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:30.781]  I mean, you always know what you're going to find before you go there.
[00:40:31.061 --> 00:40:37.766]  Before I went there, I knew he'd talk about bacterial blooms, humans are a bacteria, because that's what they've been teaching for a hundred years.
[00:40:39.087 --> 00:40:40.528]  It's always the same.
[00:40:40.568 --> 00:40:42.649]  These people are not original thinkers.
[00:40:43.629 --> 00:40:50.434]  The globalists simply give awards, fund, push the books of, worship,
[00:40:51.076 --> 00:41:01.524]  The minions that push this and then the rest of the professors and the students and the graduate students see this and then become little parrots regurgitating at a million miles an hour.
[00:41:02.325 --> 00:41:03.246]  That's all you've got to do.
[00:41:04.006 --> 00:41:06.768]  Tell everybody that Noam Chomsky is a genius when he's a hack.
[00:41:07.169 --> 00:41:09.410]  Tell everybody that Bianca is a genius when he's a hack.
[00:41:09.951 --> 00:41:12.533]  Tell everybody that this is what they do.
[00:41:14.597 --> 00:41:15.858]  This is how they operate.
[00:41:15.878 --> 00:41:17.799]  This is how they control paradigms.
[00:41:17.839 --> 00:41:19.399]  Most people aren't on the government payroll.
[00:41:19.499 --> 00:41:24.342]  They just parrot what they idolize as the penultimate in their field.
[00:41:24.722 --> 00:41:36.988]  And the highest level functionaries in every field of banking, science, every sub-discipline of science is owned, bought, and paid for by the establishment.
[00:41:40.623 --> 00:41:42.644]  Now, there are a lot of other points I want to make.
[00:41:44.004 --> 00:41:44.965]  This is how it works.
[00:41:45.025 --> 00:41:53.908]  When you get up into the top 2,000 controllers in the world, and there's 120 plus, you can debate if it's 121, 127, but different scholars differ on that, but there's around 120 ruling elites.
[00:42:01.047 --> 00:42:11.812]  There's only about 15 families, and each family, their wealth has gotten so great that they pass it on to the firstborn son, and now sometimes if it's only a daughter, to the daughter.
[00:42:13.092 --> 00:42:17.715]  And a lot of times you'll have two or three brothers and sisters who are over different arms of each family.
[00:42:17.735 --> 00:42:19.195]  But there's 15 families.
[00:42:20.016 --> 00:42:23.937]  There's several other allied families, but there's really 15 elite families.
[00:42:23.977 --> 00:42:28.900]  Some like to say 13, because that's more fanciful and sexy, but it's really 15 families.
[00:42:30.936 --> 00:42:37.438]  And so when they meet, it's 120 or thereabouts and around 20 guests at Bilderberg.
[00:42:38.519 --> 00:42:41.620]  And the individuals attending literally bow to them.
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:53.183]  They are poked and prodded like you go to the store and squeeze on a papaya or squeeze on a kiwi to see if it's, you know, squeeze on a tomato or to see if it's to your fancy.
[00:42:53.844 --> 00:42:55.464]  And then they put them in positions of power.
[00:42:55.844 --> 00:42:56.644]  But there are around 2,000
[00:42:59.159 --> 00:43:04.783]  High-level servants who have been let in to almost all of the secrets of the New World Order except the last 2%.
[00:43:04.844 --> 00:43:08.166]  They're not told the final 2% of the operation.
[00:43:09.187 --> 00:43:11.729]  And so let me now tell you what the goal is.
[00:43:13.824 --> 00:43:22.328]  When they bring them into these rooms, and we've gotten this from spies and others, we also see it in their documents, and they all go out and universally then write this and say this is what needs to be implemented.
[00:43:22.388 --> 00:43:25.089]  So we know all the secrets by the implementation.
[00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:30.772]  Nothing's really secret in operation by the ground floor intelligence clean, then cross-referenced.
[00:43:31.592 --> 00:43:42.075]  With foundational documents that are released and circulated only in the halls of academia, and they do this arrogantly, knowing the general public will never go investigate what they're actually setting up and doing.
[00:43:42.135 --> 00:43:43.455]  So, again, it's not secret.
[00:43:44.075 --> 00:43:49.477]  But then we get the next level of intelligence from our actual moles and defectors in their midst.
[00:43:51.837 --> 00:43:57.079]  Down to a level of intelligence gathering where we can say, the invasion will not be in March of 2002, it will be in March of 2003.
[00:43:58.143 --> 00:44:08.287]  When we can say that 14 months before it actually happens, when the Washington Post and the New York Times say the invasion of Iraq is guaranteed for mid-March of 2002, we say absolutely not.
[00:44:08.727 --> 00:44:15.409]  Our spies in Bilderberg tell us it will be in late March of next year, 14 months out, and with total precision it happens.
[00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:16.891]  Not because we're special, you see.
[00:44:16.911 --> 00:44:19.354]  We have our own private intelligence network.
[00:44:19.635 --> 00:44:22.058]  How do I know what intelligence is real and what is false?
[00:44:22.318 --> 00:44:29.168]  We have trusted people who've been in the field for 50 years in some cases, 25 in many cases, and decades in most cases.
[00:44:31.033 --> 00:44:32.654]  Who have proven themselves.
[00:44:32.694 --> 00:44:35.236]  They say in one year the Berlin Wall will collapse.
[00:44:35.256 --> 00:44:42.562]  There will be a staged merger of Western Europe in with the Soviet Union now happening with EU expansion.
[00:44:43.182 --> 00:44:44.883]  Exactly that happens exactly on time.
[00:44:45.604 --> 00:44:51.408]  And there are about 50 examples plus that just Jim Tucker has hit on with total precision.
[00:44:51.688 --> 00:44:52.309]  How does he do it?
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:54.280]  He's a spy, folks.
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:55.661]  He steals their documents.
[00:44:55.701 --> 00:44:56.942]  He crawls under gutters.
[00:44:57.222 --> 00:44:59.563]  He gets arrested and detained over and over again.
[00:44:59.843 --> 00:45:03.484]  He pays off people that work in the buildings to bring him the files.
[00:45:04.785 --> 00:45:05.665]  This is what he does.
[00:45:06.445 --> 00:45:09.066]  He's arrested or detained now when he gets off the airplane in Europe.
[00:45:10.387 --> 00:45:14.729]  This is what it... You know, the truth about fighting these people is they're not invincible.
[00:45:15.469 --> 00:45:18.390]  You see, we can do the things they do in the Info War.
[00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:21.792]  When I snuck into Bohemian Grove, they weren't looking for it.
[00:45:21.832 --> 00:45:22.792]  They weren't ready for it.
[00:45:23.638 --> 00:45:25.921]  When an employee shot more video last year for us.
[00:45:26.442 --> 00:45:32.109]  They're not... If we've got the will and the motivation to take them on, we can beat them.
[00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.771]  Let me go back, though.
[00:45:34.531 --> 00:45:38.877]  When they call these individuals in, this is the line that they're given.
[00:45:38.897 --> 00:45:40.138]  And this is also given at the universities.
[00:45:40.158 --> 00:45:42.201]  But the higher level, there's a little more info they're given.
[00:45:43.233 --> 00:45:43.753]  Oh, yes.
[00:45:44.334 --> 00:45:45.116]  Love and peace.
[00:45:45.176 --> 00:45:47.420]  You know, it's sad we've got to have an age of peace.
[00:45:47.881 --> 00:45:49.944]  It's sad we're going to have to have war to bring that in, though.
[00:45:50.405 --> 00:45:53.771]  All these rogue nations, Governor, you would like to be President, wouldn't you?
[00:45:54.566 --> 00:45:59.309]  All of these rogue nations are going to be able to develop bio-weapons and nuclear weapons and destroy us.
[00:45:59.829 --> 00:46:01.030]  It's a destabilizing force.
[00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:04.653]  We've got to have world government to be able to stop this from happening.
[00:46:05.033 --> 00:46:12.698]  Only a tyrannical world government, but a benign tyranny for the good of the human destiny.
[00:46:13.238 --> 00:46:14.179]  We must guard it.
[00:46:15.179 --> 00:46:18.141]  As Churchill said, the truth must be guarded with a bodyguard of lies.
[00:46:18.541 --> 00:46:21.083]  Well, we must guard life with a bodyguard of death.
[00:46:21.583 --> 00:46:22.644]  This is what they actually say.
[00:46:23.627 --> 00:46:24.787]  Jeff protects life.
[00:46:24.807 --> 00:46:25.488]  Do you understand?
[00:46:25.508 --> 00:46:27.288]  Do you understand that it's the yin-yang?
[00:46:27.308 --> 00:46:30.069]  Do you understand the theosophy of this?
[00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:31.330]  Yes, I understand.
[00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:32.230]  I was trained in college.
[00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:36.632]  As you know, my father, his grandfather, and his father before him were members of the Order.
[00:46:37.132 --> 00:46:37.952]  Yes, I know.
[00:46:37.972 --> 00:46:39.433]  That's why you're here.
[00:46:39.873 --> 00:46:40.493]  That's why you're here.
[00:46:40.513 --> 00:46:41.694]  You're the best of your family.
[00:46:41.894 --> 00:46:43.754]  You're going to be put in the top position.
[00:46:43.774 --> 00:46:46.395]  You're going to be put in the upper room of controllers.
[00:46:46.915 --> 00:46:48.076]  But we need to now tell you
[00:46:48.795 --> 00:46:49.680]  Tell you the final plan.
[00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:51.689]  I'm sure you know about the overpopulation.
[00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:52.493]  Yes, of course.
[00:46:52.533 --> 00:46:53.377]  I know that's why I'm here.
[00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:57.672]  Yes, we must eliminate 80 plus percent.
[00:46:58.012 --> 00:46:59.553]  The program is going ahead well.
[00:46:59.854 --> 00:47:08.479]  They are becoming aware of us, but we have the armies ready to carry this out, and the programs have been prepared.
[00:47:08.919 --> 00:47:11.421]  You know what you and your family are going to receive.
[00:47:11.661 --> 00:47:12.862]  You know why we must do this.
[00:47:13.202 --> 00:47:18.065]  We cannot give the life extension technologies to six and a half billion people.
[00:47:18.645 --> 00:47:20.727]  Nine billion by the time we've perfected these.
[00:47:21.886 --> 00:47:46.014]  At the current rate, we are able, if we start these programs early and if you have enough exercise and the proper nutrient intake to be able to extend your life to at least 150, Governor, I myself will have to stage my death soon and then re-emerge under a new identity because obviously we haven't been able to go ahead with the next phase of the plan where we can live in the open and guide human development and evolution into the stars.
[00:47:47.032 --> 00:47:47.813]  Oh, yes, please.
[00:47:48.093 --> 00:47:48.813]  I'm so pleased.
[00:47:48.853 --> 00:47:49.554]  I'm so honored.
[00:47:49.874 --> 00:47:51.755]  I'm so honored to be involved.
[00:47:51.835 --> 00:47:54.737]  No, no, you've been chosen because you understand.
[00:47:54.777 --> 00:47:56.038]  You have the genetics we need.
[00:47:56.078 --> 00:47:57.859]  And you're part of the family, you know.
[00:47:58.139 --> 00:47:59.800]  We're cousins on all sides.
[00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:00.480]  I know.
[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:01.861]  I'm so pleased to be part of the family.
[00:48:02.421 --> 00:48:04.022]  And it just goes on and on from that point.
[00:48:04.503 --> 00:48:08.245]  We can't allow $6.5 billion to be given access to this technology.
[00:48:09.446 --> 00:48:09.666]  And we...
[00:48:10.532 --> 00:48:14.655]  We have to take control of all these rogue nations because they're going to develop bioweapons and kill everyone.
[00:48:14.895 --> 00:48:16.557]  That's why we're going to strike first.
[00:48:17.077 --> 00:48:18.178]  We're going to strike first.
[00:48:18.678 --> 00:48:23.182]  But we know that they will rebel and the military will rebel if we hit them all at once.
[00:48:23.682 --> 00:48:37.513]  So we need you to organize in the near future controlled releases so they learn to trust us so that when we take them out of their misery in a controlled operation and when it finally happens they'll know they'll be prepared to go along with our program.
[00:48:38.954 --> 00:48:42.076]  And see, this is what they say, this is what they do.
[00:48:42.136 --> 00:48:43.816]  It's very sad, they say.
[00:48:43.836 --> 00:48:49.319]  It's very sad that a lot of beautiful people are going to have to die, as H.G.
[00:48:49.339 --> 00:48:51.780]  Wells said when he wrote The New World Order, a non-fiction book.
[00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:53.161]  He was their top futurist.
[00:48:53.941 --> 00:48:56.642]  And, of course, he gave little private audiences to the Queen and King.
[00:48:57.183 --> 00:49:00.164]  It's very sad you're all going to have to die, just like Bianca says.
[00:49:00.919 --> 00:49:02.120]  It needs to start soon.
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:02.880]  Start now.
[00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:05.462]  In fact, it's probably too late already.
[00:49:05.482 --> 00:49:06.423]  It needs to start now.
[00:49:06.823 --> 00:49:09.024]  It's very sad that he says he'll have to go first.
[00:49:09.084 --> 00:49:09.705]  He knows that.
[00:49:10.105 --> 00:49:12.647]  And his family will have to go too, see?
[00:49:13.267 --> 00:49:15.529]  And they email us and they say, What's wrong with you?
[00:49:16.089 --> 00:49:17.670]  Of course we've got to all die.
[00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.991]  Bianca only wants 90%.
[00:49:20.352 --> 00:49:21.853]  I believe all must die.
[00:49:22.513 --> 00:49:28.437]  And their blogs and their papers and their position papers and their graduate papers and their thesis papers, they're all over.
[00:49:29.147 --> 00:49:30.787]  They're all over the web.
[00:49:31.228 --> 00:49:32.668]  All over the place.
[00:49:32.948 --> 00:49:34.768]  And it's what they're all saying.
[00:49:34.789 --> 00:49:37.509]  It's what they're all doing.
[00:49:37.549 --> 00:49:40.630]  And they'll walk up to you in the grocery store when you've got three children, four children.
[00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:42.170]  They see five, they really go nuts.
[00:49:42.531 --> 00:49:43.871]  What are you doing with that many children?
[00:49:43.891 --> 00:49:45.531]  There's not enough food to feed them.
[00:49:48.972 --> 00:49:49.852]  And they're out there.
[00:49:49.932 --> 00:49:53.593]  And boy, can you imagine if these suckers win in five, ten years.
[00:49:53.693 --> 00:49:54.594]  Might even be fifteen.
[00:49:54.794 --> 00:49:55.474]  Might be next week.
[00:49:57.085 --> 00:49:58.927]  Can you imagine when they're sitting there?
[00:49:59.047 --> 00:50:00.709]  Of course, they won't even know when they're dying.
[00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:03.813]  They won't even know when whole cities are dying.
[00:50:04.654 --> 00:50:05.535]  Gruesome deaths.
[00:50:07.398 --> 00:50:08.419]  They won't even know.
[00:50:08.439 --> 00:50:16.609]  When the globalists hit us with the first wave of bio-attacks, just a small one, just millions probably, thousands first, the second wave millions, and tens of millions.
[00:50:17.208 --> 00:50:19.872]  Your little friend has high thumbs, can't eye retinas, can't do everything the police say.
[00:50:20.072 --> 00:50:22.435]  Okay, one child policy, that'll keep us safe from the biotechs.
[00:50:22.675 --> 00:50:23.897]  I'll do whatever the government says.
[00:50:24.217 --> 00:50:25.719]  Just please, please keep the U.S.
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:28.884]  safe from the biotechs in Africa, in Asia, in Latin America.
[00:50:29.124 --> 00:50:31.367]  And finally we called for closing the border and they finally did it.
[00:50:32.528 --> 00:50:33.928]  Oh, just keep me safe.
[00:50:33.948 --> 00:50:37.829]  And then you're doing everything they say 10 years from now, 15 years from now.
[00:50:38.049 --> 00:50:39.450]  You're wearing your little uniform.
[00:50:39.810 --> 00:50:40.910]  You're marching around.
[00:50:41.350 --> 00:50:45.751]  They do brain scans of you every day at work to make sure you're behaving and make sure you're not harboring resentment.
[00:50:45.931 --> 00:50:46.831]  Oh, that's mainstream news.
[00:50:46.891 --> 00:50:48.191]  Now going to Moscow airports.
[00:50:48.491 --> 00:50:49.072]  Going in U.S.
[00:50:49.112 --> 00:50:49.532]  airports.
[00:50:49.952 --> 00:50:50.872]  Going in the businesses.
[00:50:52.172 --> 00:50:53.012]  You see the control.
[00:50:53.032 --> 00:50:54.453]  A nightmare science fiction.
[00:50:54.673 --> 00:50:56.313]  It's here now.
[00:50:56.493 --> 00:50:58.053]  They're going to kill us.
[00:50:58.414 --> 00:50:59.694]  Guaranteed.
[00:50:59.934 --> 00:51:00.654]  Unless we stop them.
[00:51:03.163 --> 00:51:06.025]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:06.266 --> 00:51:07.867]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:08.187 --> 00:51:12.871]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:13.211 --> 00:51:19.957]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:20.257 --> 00:51:22.258]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:22.458 --> 00:51:25.299]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:25.399 --> 00:51:30.061]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:30.262 --> 00:51:34.684]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.904 --> 00:51:42.127]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:42.367 --> 00:51:44.788]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:51:44.948 --> 00:51:46.689]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[00:52:02.159 --> 00:52:10.426]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:10.686 --> 00:52:15.029]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:15.330 --> 00:52:24.257]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:24.457 --> 00:52:28.080]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:33.386]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:33.687 --> 00:52:40.395]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:52:40.894 --> 00:52:41.535]  What about you?
[00:52:42.195 --> 00:52:47.560]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:53:38.953 --> 00:53:39.553]  We're good to go.
[00:54:06.909 --> 00:54:10.432]  We'll be taking your calls coming up in the next hour at 1-800-259-9231 on this live Thursday edition.
[00:54:10.452 --> 00:54:10.752]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:54:10.832 --> 00:54:13.174]  Websites are infowars.com, infowars.net, jonesreport.com, prisonplanet.tv.
[00:54:13.194 --> 00:54:13.854]  So this is what we face.
[00:54:13.874 --> 00:54:14.495]  We face...
[00:54:27.415 --> 00:54:39.561]  What is it, 21 level 4 bioweapons labs in the United States, and then just hundreds of level 3s and 2s, where they quote, study bioweapons, but then they admit that they're really developing them, and chemical weapons as well.
[00:54:40.322 --> 00:54:42.503]  And then now they're going to build 36 more.
[00:54:42.763 --> 00:54:49.346]  UT at Galveston has a level 4 bioweapons lab, you can see the federal complaints about it, in a level 3 containment.
[00:54:49.366 --> 00:54:50.847]  That's totally illegal, totally dangerous.
[00:54:50.867 --> 00:54:53.008]  I mean, they've got weaponized bioweapons,
[00:54:53.823 --> 00:54:54.804]  That's what Level 4 is.
[00:54:54.844 --> 00:54:55.984]  Just super weapons.
[00:54:57.205 --> 00:55:00.506]  Down there, on the coast, in a Level 3 facility.
[00:55:01.407 --> 00:55:02.487]  That's illegal, but they do it.
[00:55:02.948 --> 00:55:04.388]  And it's just filled with people.
[00:55:04.408 --> 00:55:06.929]  The majority of them believe that 80% should be killed.
[00:55:07.210 --> 00:55:08.010]  The moderates believe 90%.
[00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:10.251]  And the radicals believe 100%.
[00:55:11.112 --> 00:55:12.732]  And I'm not kidding.
[00:55:12.772 --> 00:55:13.713]  This is mainstream news.
[00:55:14.573 --> 00:55:17.215]  And all of this is happening.
[00:55:17.255 --> 00:55:17.975]  All of this is going on.
[00:55:18.275 --> 00:55:20.036]  So we're not just in danger of the globalists.
[00:55:20.802 --> 00:55:22.523]  We're not just... I mean, remember the super flu?
[00:55:22.543 --> 00:55:25.245]  How the government mailed out over 5,000 samples all over the world?
[00:55:25.265 --> 00:55:33.411]  And then they mailed out samples of the flu they've got up in Wisconsin that's 38,000 times stronger than any other flu ever known that they've created?
[00:55:33.431 --> 00:55:34.812]  That was in the Associated Press.
[00:55:34.852 --> 00:55:36.233]  Oh, we're mailing out super flu!
[00:55:36.513 --> 00:55:38.834]  Just mailing it to all these people so they can do tests.
[00:55:40.395 --> 00:55:43.337]  Oh, I mean, they're mailing it in FedEx and UPS packages was in the news.
[00:55:43.357 --> 00:55:43.958]  Remember last year?
[00:55:45.547 --> 00:55:47.068]  Oh, but the cops have got to pull you over.
[00:55:47.108 --> 00:55:47.868]  We need to search your car.
[00:55:47.888 --> 00:55:48.388]  Look for guns.
[00:55:48.608 --> 00:55:49.228]  Well, why, officer?
[00:55:49.248 --> 00:55:49.849]  You don't have a warrant.
[00:55:50.269 --> 00:55:51.429]  Post 9-11, ma'am.
[00:55:51.469 --> 00:55:52.429]  America's a little different.
[00:55:52.449 --> 00:55:54.230]  Meanwhile, huge cattle trailers.
[00:55:54.810 --> 00:55:56.211]  One just overturned and killed a bunch of illegals.
[00:55:56.571 --> 00:55:59.232]  Driving down the road, 18 wheelers full of illegals from all over the world.
[00:55:59.272 --> 00:55:59.972]  Borders wide open.
[00:56:00.252 --> 00:56:01.132]  We need to search you.
[00:56:01.152 --> 00:56:02.873]  We need to search your house without a warrant.
[00:56:02.893 --> 00:56:05.614]  We need to arrest people for selling fenced baby food.
[00:56:05.954 --> 00:56:08.795]  We need to arrest people who play rock and roll music on an airplane.
[00:56:08.815 --> 00:56:10.355]  They say it's terrorists and Led Zeppelin.
[00:56:11.076 --> 00:56:11.896]  That was in the news yesterday.
[00:56:13.928 --> 00:56:15.109]  Just everyone running around in fear.
[00:56:15.129 --> 00:56:17.151]  Meanwhile, there's bioweapons laboratories everywhere.
[00:56:17.171 --> 00:56:19.573]  Psychopathic elites running things that say they want to kill us.
[00:56:19.813 --> 00:56:24.036]  And then all these nutty professors and lunatics going, we all need to die for the Earth.
[00:56:24.837 --> 00:56:26.298]  I can't wait until it's released.
[00:56:26.899 --> 00:56:28.260]  And then people go, man, that's scary.
[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:37.507]  I mean, I've got emails right here from people in the biology department, University of Texas at Arlington, going, I said you could post my email, but please take my name off.
[00:56:37.747 --> 00:56:39.609]  I know I said you could, but I'm getting threats.
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:41.841]  People are saying they want to get me.
[00:56:42.341 --> 00:56:44.882]  Well, I don't want anybody to get you, and please, folks, don't harass these people.
[00:56:45.402 --> 00:56:46.523]  But notice how they're freaking out.
[00:56:46.723 --> 00:56:47.943]  People say they want to get me.
[00:56:48.543 --> 00:56:48.964]  Oh, no.
[00:56:49.604 --> 00:56:51.465]  Well, but I thought we all need to die.
[00:56:51.565 --> 00:56:53.285]  I mean, wait, I thought we're all bad.
[00:56:53.766 --> 00:56:55.166]  But my life's so precious.
[00:56:56.127 --> 00:56:57.147]  Well, then you better worry.
[00:56:57.167 --> 00:57:00.068]  If you're so worried about your life, you better worry about the government, lady.
[00:57:01.109 --> 00:57:02.389]  You better worry about the government.
[00:57:02.409 --> 00:57:04.030]  You better worry about nutty professors.
[00:57:05.871 --> 00:57:08.392]  Or the government doing something and blaming it on nutty professors.
[00:57:09.261 --> 00:57:12.603]  When we come back at the 8 after break, a lot of stations don't carry the first five minutes.
[00:57:12.623 --> 00:57:13.784]  I wish you did, but it's okay if you don't.
[00:57:14.204 --> 00:57:14.724]  We'll come back.
[00:57:14.764 --> 00:57:15.545]  I'll talk some more.
[00:57:15.565 --> 00:57:23.630]  Then I'll play a little clip from the 12 Monkeys, Terry Gilliam film, where the crazy scientist releases a bioweapon and kills 98% of the world population.
[00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:26.232]  Bruce Willis is sitting back in town trying to stop it.
[00:57:26.252 --> 00:57:28.053]  I mean, why do they make films about this?
[00:57:28.093 --> 00:57:29.814]  Because anybody who went to college heard this!
[00:57:32.412 --> 00:57:34.273]  I mean, that's the type of stuff we deal with.
[00:57:34.913 --> 00:57:36.314]  We ought to get some of the DVD extras.
[00:57:36.334 --> 00:57:40.557]  I know they talk about the film in there and talk about that, so we need to play that too.
[00:57:41.057 --> 00:57:48.561]  I've always meant to play a clip from the summation of Jim Garrison from JFK with Oliver Stone, and I'm going to do that in the third hour today.
[00:57:48.881 --> 00:57:51.082]  We will have open phones, and the FBI did visit Bianca.
[00:57:51.102 --> 00:57:51.743]  We'll get into that.
[00:57:53.684 --> 00:57:55.605]  Protestors defend carrying Mexican flags.
[00:57:56.554 --> 00:57:59.456]  And we'll reconquise the signs, but they just say it's nice.
[00:57:59.576 --> 00:58:03.738]  Associated Press, again, pacifying us, lay down, everything's fine, go along, get along.
[00:58:04.058 --> 00:58:05.279]  We'll get into all that, too, today.
[00:58:06.599 --> 00:58:10.562]  Of course, another head of IRA, Sinn Féin, has been found tortured to death.
[00:58:10.602 --> 00:58:13.723]  He blew the whistle and admitted he was always British intelligence the whole time.
[00:58:14.084 --> 00:58:15.604]  All these guys carrying out terror are.
[00:58:15.904 --> 00:58:17.725]  And then he was found tortured to death at his home.
[00:58:17.745 --> 00:58:20.587]  The IRA did it, sure, and I'm an Easter Bunny.
[00:58:21.147 --> 00:58:23.088]  The IRA is British intelligence.
[00:58:23.609 --> 00:58:24.169]  Let's admit it.
[00:58:25.604 --> 00:58:28.948]  Why would the British intelligence attack itself?
[00:58:29.608 --> 00:58:33.252]  As a pretext to keep military forces in the north of Ireland.
[00:58:34.553 --> 00:58:37.016]  Come on, the light bulb can go off for you, neocons.
[00:58:37.857 --> 00:58:39.238]  We'll be right back with the second hour.
[00:58:41.681 --> 00:58:46.345]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:58.028 --> 00:58:58.668]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.329 --> 00:59:00.389]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.089 --> 00:59:02.210]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.850 --> 00:59:03.691]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.431 --> 00:59:05.332]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.992 --> 00:59:09.654]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.174 --> 00:59:14.317]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.298 --> 00:59:18.519]  I don't understand.
[00:59:19.466 --> 00:59:21.970]  People are calling me saying mean things.
[00:59:22.651 --> 00:59:26.676]  I just said I think the entire population should die and that humans are bad.
[00:59:27.597 --> 00:59:31.623]  And I... And I work in the biology department.
[00:59:32.765 --> 00:59:40.087]  I mean, that's the kind of emails that I'm getting from people who've got blogs or shot their mouths off or sent us emails.
[00:59:40.487 --> 00:59:42.827]  And then saying, post it, and we post it, and then they get all this.
[00:59:42.887 --> 00:59:44.368]  Folks, do not threaten these people.
[00:59:44.928 --> 00:59:46.708]  Okay, that just feeds into their pathology.
[00:59:47.248 --> 00:59:51.089]  Oh, yes, Dr. Bianca says he knows he needs to go first with his family.
[00:59:51.429 --> 00:59:52.209]  What's wrong with you?
[00:59:52.249 --> 00:59:53.790]  That's completely normal.
[00:59:55.170 --> 00:59:56.590]  You people are crazy.
[00:59:56.610 --> 00:59:59.151]  You don't want everyone to die.
[01:00:00.074 --> 01:00:01.214]  And then they're shocked.
[01:00:01.855 --> 01:00:03.355]  People are threatening me.
[01:00:03.375 --> 01:00:07.316]  Dr. Bianca, I'm getting threats.
[01:00:09.096 --> 01:00:10.477]  I can't believe it.
[01:00:10.497 --> 01:00:16.118]  I'm saying I can't wait for everyone to die, but they're upset about it.
[01:00:16.899 --> 01:00:18.239]  These people are nuts.
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:21.700]  Just warn others, okay?
[01:00:22.927 --> 01:00:30.029]  I think we can convert back to reality a lot of these youngins, these graduate students and newly christened professors.
[01:00:30.429 --> 01:00:38.511]  They just see these big professors that are worshipped and make all this money, and they just go on and on and think, well, that's success because they've got all these laurels heaped on them.
[01:00:38.531 --> 01:00:45.273]  They don't understand the paradigm of how the government pays off through the foundations people have put out their trash.
[01:00:45.533 --> 01:00:48.454]  That's why almost all the top professors say we all need to be killed.
[01:00:48.874 --> 01:00:49.854]  It's not just Pianca.
[01:00:51.224 --> 01:01:01.030]  I've got a bunch of other news we'll cover today, but I mentioned that in the Terry Gilliam film, Twelve Monkeys, where this nutty professor releases a bio-weapon, the psycho-professor, and kills 98% of the public.
[01:01:01.571 --> 01:01:04.012]  And then the whole film, he's trying to figure out why this is happening.
[01:01:04.673 --> 01:01:08.495]  There's these little clues, so we're not going to play much over about a minute and a half or so.
[01:01:09.416 --> 01:01:12.178]  And I'm listening to the commentaries by Terry Gilliam on the film.
[01:01:12.838 --> 01:01:20.323]  I'm reading some of their production notes they have on the DVD, and they talk about dealing with nutty professors and the madness, past and present.
[01:01:21.818 --> 01:01:23.840]  So it just shows how in the culture this is.
[01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:25.162]  There's films about this.
[01:01:25.702 --> 01:01:26.583]  This is not new.
[01:01:26.823 --> 01:01:33.651]  When someone advocating the annihilation of 90% of the population is good, it says you can't wait for it to start.
[01:01:34.648 --> 01:01:36.990]  And that AIDS isn't killing Africans quick enough.
[01:01:37.050 --> 01:01:39.711]  And that China's one-shot policy in, quote, police state is good.
[01:01:40.072 --> 01:01:42.053]  And 95% give it a standing ovation.
[01:01:42.273 --> 01:01:48.897]  And that's the academia that's going to run the operations, taking your farm, your ranch, CPSing your kids, putting you on Ritalin and Prozac.
[01:01:49.198 --> 01:01:54.021]  All the horrible things they're doing, they're told this helps the diseased culture.
[01:01:54.101 --> 01:01:55.682]  When they are the disease.
[01:01:58.584 --> 01:02:00.565]  And then these phony environmentalists and ecologists...
[01:02:01.676 --> 01:02:03.197]  Could care less about all the real crises.
[01:02:03.217 --> 01:02:05.778]  We'll have open phones in the next two hours.
[01:02:05.798 --> 01:02:07.739]  We're going to take a lot of your calls today.
[01:02:07.779 --> 01:02:11.041]  I'm proud of the fact that I took about 25 calls yesterday.
[01:02:11.121 --> 01:02:14.782]  Actually, getting to your calls, I took about 35 or so the day before that.
[01:02:14.802 --> 01:02:19.685]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us.
[01:02:20.685 --> 01:02:23.587]  And I want to encourage all of you to not procrastinate.
[01:02:23.627 --> 01:02:24.587]  Only a few more days.
[01:02:24.647 --> 01:02:26.268]  I extended a few days because of a request.
[01:02:27.008 --> 01:02:28.409]  People requested us to extend a few days.
[01:02:29.568 --> 01:02:32.469]  To get five months free at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:02:32.609 --> 01:02:35.169]  All 14 of my films, my book, Paul Watson's book.
[01:02:35.189 --> 01:02:36.730]  You can download copies of my films.
[01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:37.710]  It's a great activist tool.
[01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:46.652]  Dozens and dozens of other films we've been authorized to post, like Loose Change 2, or Patrick Ted Pike's materials, or Robert Galen Ross videos, the American Union, all that.
[01:02:46.912 --> 01:02:47.912]  It's just so good.
[01:02:48.292 --> 01:02:52.874]  All my best audio interviews, my local TV show, weekly in-studio interviews are up there.
[01:02:52.894 --> 01:02:54.374]  I've got two more of those going up this week.
[01:02:54.734 --> 01:02:55.674]  They're supposed to be up today.
[01:02:56.874 --> 01:02:58.235]  It's all up on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:03:00.248 --> 01:03:01.449]  It's all there for you.
[01:03:01.869 --> 01:03:02.269]  15 cents a day.
[01:03:02.309 --> 01:03:04.070]  Get a monthly subscription.
[01:03:04.090 --> 01:03:04.070]  $5.95.
[01:03:04.270 --> 01:03:07.692]  Or get a year and get five months free.
[01:03:08.432 --> 01:03:10.693]  Now, this is going to end in four days.
[01:03:11.894 --> 01:03:12.574]  It's going to end.
[01:03:12.654 --> 01:03:14.095]  I extended it a few days.
[01:03:14.155 --> 01:03:15.195]  It's going to end in four days.
[01:03:15.495 --> 01:03:20.938]  PrisonPlanet.tv By the way, we're carrying in hard copy the new film that just came out.
[01:03:22.029 --> 01:03:24.492]  Secret Ministries of America's Beginnings, The New Atlantis.
[01:03:24.692 --> 01:03:26.915]  And it's not about the fabled Atlantis.
[01:03:26.975 --> 01:03:29.739]  It's how they believed America would be the new Atlantis for the New World Order.
[01:03:30.159 --> 01:03:33.103]  And Sir Francis Bacon, Benjamin Franklin, Queen Elizabeth, how they all set it up.
[01:03:34.184 --> 01:03:36.066]  You need to get it available at Infowars.com.
[01:03:36.086 --> 01:03:39.771]  You have a safe, secure online video and book store.
[01:03:40.891 --> 01:03:41.772]  We have it only in DVD.
[01:03:41.892 --> 01:03:43.394]  And then all my other films are there, too.
[01:03:43.414 --> 01:03:46.678]  So go online and order a hard copy right now or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:03:46.698 --> 01:03:47.379]  Stay with us.
[01:03:47.419 --> 01:03:48.581]  Transmission continues.
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:04:01.988]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:04:02.268 --> 01:04:07.013]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:04:07.234 --> 01:04:12.880]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:17.622]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:04:17.842 --> 01:04:25.026]  The casual society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:04:25.046 --> 01:04:29.568]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.728 --> 01:04:32.229]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:04:32.469 --> 01:04:38.592]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional rights.
[01:04:38.592 --> 01:04:39.413]  Or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:04:39.493 --> 01:04:39.754]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:04:53.587 --> 01:04:55.167]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:04:55.568 --> 01:05:01.289]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:05:01.549 --> 01:05:06.690]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:05:07.031 --> 01:05:16.293]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:05:16.653 --> 01:05:21.594]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:05:21.934 --> 01:05:25.935]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.

[01:05:53.579 --> 01:05:55.921]  ...guaranteed to them by the Second Amendment...
[01:06:17.674 --> 01:06:23.377]  The head of the United Nations forces that would control all arms would always be a communist by agreement.

[01:06:53.297 --> 01:06:58.361]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.701 --> 01:07:01.043]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:01.063 --> 01:07:04.546]  Terry Gilliam
[01:07:07.173 --> 01:07:24.029]  Terry Gillian, who is aware of the New World Order, in 1995 produced 12 Monkeys, where a psychopathic biology professor at a major university in New York releases a bioweapon, killing 98% of the public, the elite going to underground bases.
[01:07:24.970 --> 01:07:27.572]  And Bruce Willis has been sent back in the future to try to stop it.
[01:07:27.592 --> 01:07:29.774]  Of course, it will be the elite that launches this attack.
[01:07:29.794 --> 01:07:30.035]  That's a...
[01:07:31.089 --> 01:07:32.270]  I'd say an 80% chance.
[01:07:33.251 --> 01:07:41.300]  And there'll probably be nutty scientists that release stuff that doesn't kill everybody but kills tens of thousands and then helps them bring in martial law before that even happens.
[01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:45.624]  And I'm not saying Pianca's going to do that, but one of his thousands of followers may.
[01:07:46.785 --> 01:07:48.287]  Let's go ahead and play the 12 Monkeys clip.
[01:07:49.381 --> 01:07:52.664]  I think, Dr. Raley, you're giving the alarmists a bad name.
[01:07:52.684 --> 01:07:53.905]  I have.
[01:07:54.486 --> 01:07:59.410]  Surely there's very real and very convincing data that the planet cannot survive the excesses of the human race.
[01:07:59.690 --> 01:08:00.291]  This is true.
[01:08:00.511 --> 01:08:07.898]  Proliferation of atomic devices, uncontrolled breeding habits, pollution of land, sea, and air, the rape of the environment.
[01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:12.502]  In this context, isn't it obvious that Chicken Little represents the same vision?
[01:08:13.323 --> 01:08:16.386]  And that Homo sapiens motto, let's go shopping,
[01:08:17.239 --> 01:08:18.660]  Is the cry of the true lunatic?
[01:08:20.402 --> 01:08:22.824]  Let's consider again our current information.
[01:08:23.765 --> 01:08:32.833]  If the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on December 27, 1996, that makes us know that... It was released in Philadelphia probably on December 13, 1996.
[01:08:34.495 --> 01:08:41.962]  And was seen sequentially after that in... San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, uh...
[01:08:42.828 --> 01:08:46.871]  Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
[01:08:49.833 --> 01:08:51.434]  And again, it's all clues in the film.
[01:08:51.494 --> 01:08:52.235]  And I said New York.
[01:08:52.255 --> 01:08:52.795]  It's Philadelphia.
[01:08:52.815 --> 01:08:53.456]  It'll look like New York.
[01:08:53.916 --> 01:08:56.998]  So, you know, this is what's going on.
[01:08:57.018 --> 01:09:00.761]  And that's exactly what Bianca and sickos like him are saying.
[01:09:01.821 --> 01:09:03.463]  And the FBI did go questioning him.
[01:09:03.523 --> 01:09:04.243]  I'll get into that later.
[01:09:04.263 --> 01:09:05.264]  We're going to take more of your calls.
[01:09:05.284 --> 01:09:06.845]  I'm spending a lot of time on this this week.
[01:09:08.697 --> 01:09:16.992]  We also spent time on Monday and Tuesday on 9-11 with the former head of Star Wars saying 9-11 is an inside job, Dr. Bob Bowman, and of course we had Andrea Griffin.
[01:09:17.012 --> 01:09:20.378]  We'll be doing more on 9-11 tomorrow and in the next week.
[01:09:21.187 --> 01:09:22.067]  But this is important.
[01:09:22.467 --> 01:09:31.290]  Because 9-11 is a foundational event to get the police state in place globally, to dominate foreign countries first, to get control for global government, so they can then kill us.
[01:09:31.670 --> 01:09:43.374]  That's the final object, so the elite can have the life-exchanging technologies, so that they're so greedy they want to control and be the progenitors of our entire future, and they say that, again, we can't have 6.5 billion people that have access to all this.
[01:09:43.674 --> 01:09:44.454]  This is what they say.
[01:09:44.474 --> 01:09:46.455]  And I always talk about this, and people don't believe me,
[01:09:46.895 --> 01:09:52.379]  And then you're shocked when you read Wired Magazine and top scientists are giving huge symposiums in L.A.
[01:09:52.419 --> 01:09:54.301]  saying the elite plans to kill us.
[01:09:55.282 --> 01:09:58.064]  I remember four years ago, five years ago, right before 9-11.
[01:09:58.344 --> 01:09:59.985]  It was an April issue of Wired Magazine 2000.
[01:10:00.025 --> 01:10:01.746]  So I guess it's six years ago.
[01:10:01.766 --> 01:10:03.948]  See, I give out a wrong number, but I scan my memory.
[01:10:03.968 --> 01:10:07.050]  It was April issue 2000.
[01:10:07.351 --> 01:10:08.391]  Why the Future Doesn't Need Us.
[01:10:08.952 --> 01:10:11.294]  And Bill Joy, who's worth, what, $4 billion.
[01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:15.477]  And the head of Sun Microsystems, co-chairman.
[01:10:16.776 --> 01:10:27.549]  He said, yeah, I went to this big global summit, and he said there were all these top scientists saying the elite plans to kill us, plans to kill 80% of us, and they're going to use a technological grid to do it.
[01:10:28.129 --> 01:10:33.796]  I mean, that's a billionaire at the elite meetings coming out freaking out warning you.
[01:10:34.815 --> 01:10:36.315]  You see, I just keep remembering all these.
[01:10:36.476 --> 01:10:39.036]  I've listed about 20 elite documents last hour.
[01:10:39.056 --> 01:10:40.097]  Now I'm giving you another one.
[01:10:40.317 --> 01:10:41.517]  I don't want to hear, where are they?
[01:10:41.857 --> 01:10:43.278]  People kept saying, Alex, it's ridiculous.
[01:10:43.298 --> 01:10:46.519]  You say the elite want to exterminate us so they can have the life-saving technologies.
[01:10:46.959 --> 01:10:48.619]  And it was in the Washington Post two months ago.
[01:10:49.079 --> 01:11:00.903]  And I'm so used to covering this and just kind of disregarding it because it's so old hat here that I've sent emails to the Washington Post article and a bunch of other publications I've been getting where they're now saying it, see?
[01:11:02.173 --> 01:11:10.355]  They're now going, well, I was in an elite meeting where these professors are saying that the elite's going to kill most of us and then the rest of us that go along with it will be given life extension.
[01:11:11.335 --> 01:11:12.856]  I mean, imagine dangling that.
[01:11:12.916 --> 01:11:19.597]  That's worth more than all the mistresses and all the bank vaults of gold and all the... What would you do for the fountain of youth?
[01:11:20.277 --> 01:11:22.398]  These people don't believe in life after death, most of them.
[01:11:22.718 --> 01:11:23.798]  They only believe in themselves.
[01:11:23.818 --> 01:11:27.079]  They're very nihilistic and they're a bunch of greedy bastards at their core.
[01:11:27.959 --> 01:11:30.480]  Excuse my mild French, but no, I mean, they really are.
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:32.220]  I guess they don't have a father.
[01:11:33.001 --> 01:11:33.701]  God is in their lives.
[01:11:34.081 --> 01:11:35.462]  They are spiritual bastards.
[01:11:35.482 --> 01:11:36.742]  But I guess they do have a father, the devil.
[01:11:37.903 --> 01:11:39.783]  So there's so much of this.
[01:11:39.803 --> 01:11:41.624]  There's so much going on.
[01:11:41.644 --> 01:11:43.125]  There's so many facets.
[01:11:44.945 --> 01:11:46.546]  Play that 12 Monkeys clip one more time.
[01:11:48.891 --> 01:11:52.172]  I think, Dr. Raley, you've given your life a bad name.
[01:11:52.192 --> 01:11:52.792]  I have?
[01:11:52.852 --> 01:11:53.392]  Mm-hmm.
[01:11:53.992 --> 01:11:58.894]  Surely there's very real and very convincing data that the planet cannot survive the excesses of the human race.
[01:11:58.914 --> 01:11:59.774]  This is true.
[01:11:59.994 --> 01:12:07.416]  Proliferation of atomic devices, uncontrolled breeding habits, pollution of land, sea, and air, the rape of the environment.
[01:12:07.916 --> 01:12:11.997]  In this context, isn't it obvious that Chicken Little represents the sane vision?
[01:12:12.817 --> 01:12:15.878]  And that Homo sapiens motto, let's go shopping,
[01:12:16.758 --> 01:12:18.139]  Is the private patrol lunatic?
[01:12:19.901 --> 01:12:22.342]  Let's consider again our current information.
[01:12:23.283 --> 01:12:32.330]  If the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on December 27, 1996, that makes us know that... It was released in Philadelphia probably on December 13, 1996.
[01:12:34.031 --> 01:12:46.341]  And was seen sequentially after that in... San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
[01:12:50.342 --> 01:12:54.284]  Again, and there's just lots of close-up of the film, and then you see him release the bioweapon, and everybody gets killed.
[01:12:55.425 --> 01:12:56.605]  And so that's basically what happens.
[01:12:57.146 --> 01:12:57.926]  I'm going to go to your calls.
[01:12:57.966 --> 01:13:00.107]  I'm going to move quickly through you, because I want to get to everybody.
[01:13:00.287 --> 01:13:01.988]  It's not fair to the others that always are having to hold.
[01:13:02.288 --> 01:13:03.589]  Patrick in Kentucky, you're on the air.
[01:13:03.629 --> 01:13:03.989]  Go ahead.
[01:13:04.169 --> 01:13:06.810]  Have you had your aspartame today, Alex?
[01:13:07.371 --> 01:13:09.332]  Yeah, big government report saying it's nutritious.
[01:13:09.372 --> 01:13:11.693]  How dare I say it's bad when all the human studies say it's deadly?
[01:13:12.353 --> 01:13:19.757]  Two things I wanted you to touch deep into was Wesley Clark going around the country
[01:13:20.416 --> 01:13:30.904]  Endorsing these candidates for Congress and the differentiation between what he is as a mole and what Jim Guy Tucker is as a mole.
[01:13:32.225 --> 01:13:48.217]  And also, about last night, I saw a local ABC affiliate talking about here in Newburgh, Indiana, a nerve gas drill going on.
[01:13:48.738 --> 01:13:50.099]  If you know anything about that,
[01:13:51.321 --> 01:13:52.922]  Okay, let me answer the last question first.
[01:13:52.962 --> 01:13:53.542]  Thanks for the call.
[01:13:53.662 --> 01:13:53.842]  Okay.
[01:13:54.843 --> 01:14:01.647]  They have had thousands and thousands and thousands, no one knows how many, but they have thousands every year of drills.
[01:14:02.127 --> 01:14:04.708]  And these are re-education camp drills.
[01:14:05.369 --> 01:14:10.031]  Again, America itself is going to be a giant camp with transponders, tracking control systems, you name it.
[01:14:11.092 --> 01:14:14.654]  And a re-education is meant to shock you
[01:14:15.450 --> 01:14:21.146]  To shock you and then to destroy your original core values and then replace it with new values.
[01:14:21.166 --> 01:14:23.712]  And the old classic re-education camp is big.
[01:14:24.384 --> 01:14:40.771]  Big movie screens and lights 24 hours a day and beating people up and torturing your family in front of you and freaking everyone out and getting people to turn against you and getting everyone to fight with each other and then being nice to you at the end when you really do accept the new view now that you've been brainwashed.
[01:14:41.051 --> 01:14:46.734]  And if you won't be broken and be brainwashed, you're taken out to a landfill a mile away and shot in the back of the head and thrown in a pit.
[01:14:47.934 --> 01:14:51.296]  And a bulldozer covers you and the other 20 people they killed that day up.
[01:14:52.119 --> 01:15:01.487]  Now, the slick re-education camps of today are in our living rooms, watching television, being brainwashed, being put into fear, and the government's always the savior.
[01:15:01.727 --> 01:15:03.989]  Oh, it's very scary, but if you just give up your rights, we'll save you.
[01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:15.818]  Or it's drills all over the country where they have elementary students come and sit out in the parking lot as cops aim machine guns at them, screaming at them, simulating terrorist attacks, or they put fake blood on them and then tell them the homeschoolers are going to kill them.
[01:15:16.138 --> 01:15:16.839]  That's mainstream news.
[01:15:17.998 --> 01:15:33.435]  Re-education is giving handbooks and sending every state worker in Virginia, and this is mainstream news, where they're given handbooks and are told that the Founding Fathers are terrorists, guns are evil, anyone protesting for land rights, what exact words are, land rights activists.
[01:15:34.275 --> 01:15:35.596]  Property rights activists, excuse me.
[01:15:36.696 --> 01:15:38.277]  Those that make frequent references to the U.S.
[01:15:38.297 --> 01:15:38.877]  Constitution.
[01:15:38.897 --> 01:15:39.718]  That's nationwide.
[01:15:40.698 --> 01:15:41.719]  That's re-education.
[01:15:41.859 --> 01:15:45.961]  They send you in a big classroom where most of the people are there for their fourth or fifth time.
[01:15:46.021 --> 01:15:46.841]  Most people agree.
[01:15:47.281 --> 01:15:50.443]  About 15% are new, and you see everyone agreeing, nodding their heads.
[01:15:50.843 --> 01:15:51.924]  We're social creatures.
[01:15:51.964 --> 01:15:52.864]  We're social mammals.
[01:15:54.065 --> 01:15:57.366]  And so most people just go, well, if everybody else thinks it's normal, then it must be.
[01:15:58.447 --> 01:15:59.427]  Just like with the Aztecs.
[01:15:59.467 --> 01:16:01.148]  It was normal to sacrifice your children.
[01:16:02.216 --> 01:16:05.318]  So if we went back in time, we would be the abnormal ones, see?
[01:16:05.678 --> 01:16:06.819]  They would see us as crazy.
[01:16:07.179 --> 01:16:13.904]  At the University of Texas, and Yale, and Harvard, and Princeton, and Berkeley, Bianca is normal.
[01:16:14.184 --> 01:16:15.645]  His biology students are normal.
[01:16:15.665 --> 01:16:21.328]  That's why they send us crazy emails and letters, and letters to the editor, going, of course it's normal.
[01:16:21.388 --> 01:16:23.009]  It's loving to kill everyone.
[01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:24.550]  What's wrong with you?
[01:16:24.811 --> 01:16:25.911]  You people are nuts.
[01:16:26.211 --> 01:16:28.853]  How could you not think we should all be eliminated?
[01:16:29.654 --> 01:16:30.634]  See, to them, it's like, wow...
[01:16:32.276 --> 01:16:35.879]  It's like somebody from, you know, a Jim Jones cult or somebody from a Hellbop cult.
[01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:43.666]  It's like, of course we're going to drink the poison and lay down in our beds and then our spirits will be picked up by the spaceship.
[01:16:44.247 --> 01:16:45.408]  What's wrong with you?
[01:16:45.688 --> 01:16:47.910]  You're not going to kill yourself?
[01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:48.751]  Of course.
[01:16:49.151 --> 01:16:51.774]  Because in the Hellbop cult, they're all normal.
[01:16:52.114 --> 01:16:53.795]  It's cult psychology.
[01:16:55.757 --> 01:16:56.498]  In the Mafia.
[01:16:57.637 --> 01:16:58.397]  They live together.
[01:16:58.417 --> 01:16:59.578]  They go on vacation together.
[01:16:59.618 --> 01:17:00.898]  They go to the mafia church.
[01:17:00.938 --> 01:17:04.359]  To them, it's normal to kill people and steal and shake down shop owners.
[01:17:05.839 --> 01:17:08.060]  Because in their little culture, it is normal.
[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:14.001]  For the Nazis, it was normal to stomp babies' brains out and shoot people in the back of the head and work them to death in work camps.
[01:17:14.402 --> 01:17:15.962]  In the Soviet Union, it was normal.
[01:17:16.682 --> 01:17:18.203]  You see, they're normalizing.
[01:17:18.243 --> 01:17:22.484]  That's why the dramas on TV universally tell you torture is good, even of children.
[01:17:22.664 --> 01:17:23.924]  They're changing us.
[01:17:24.264 --> 01:17:26.985]  We're being re-educated, reformed.
[01:17:27.970 --> 01:17:31.271]  And so your question about a drill, yeah, I saw that.
[01:17:31.591 --> 01:17:32.871]  They're having drills everywhere.
[01:17:32.951 --> 01:17:39.153]  Nerve gas attack drills, nuke attack drills, mainly militia attack drills and homeschooler attack drills.
[01:17:39.213 --> 01:17:46.375]  And they're just teaching everyone with drills, which are no basis in reality, screaming at eight-year-olds, pointing machine guns at them.
[01:17:46.395 --> 01:17:51.317]  We got video of it crying, saying, I'm the homeschoolers against public education!
[01:17:51.777 --> 01:17:52.157]  Die!
[01:17:52.197 --> 01:17:52.657]  Die!
[01:17:53.057 --> 01:17:55.878]  And the kids, they'll traumatize for life!
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:57.980]  Can you imagine?
[01:17:58.020 --> 01:17:59.981]  That's like a kidnapper grabbing the kid and doing that.
[01:18:00.001 --> 01:18:00.922]  And we got video of it.
[01:18:01.482 --> 01:18:02.342]  It's in Road to Tyranny.
[01:18:02.382 --> 01:18:03.162]  Little kid's crying.
[01:18:03.242 --> 01:18:03.743]  Elementary.
[01:18:05.143 --> 01:18:06.284]  Little kid's crying.
[01:18:06.324 --> 01:18:07.924]  Man, right out in the open.
[01:18:08.264 --> 01:18:11.205]  And the cops, they're told, well, we're doing this to drill federal funding.
[01:18:11.506 --> 01:18:13.987]  And the cop in the back of their head goes, this is really bad what I'm doing.
[01:18:14.027 --> 01:18:16.167]  But the sergeant, the captain says, do it.
[01:18:16.928 --> 01:18:18.368]  I guess Columbine was bad.
[01:18:18.388 --> 01:18:19.729]  We've got to do this to keep people safe.
[01:18:19.809 --> 01:18:20.289]  All right.
[01:18:21.084 --> 01:18:23.525]  And then, cop of the year gets shot in the head in Fort Worth.
[01:18:23.845 --> 01:18:29.146]  They shoot an 11-year-old girl in the face in Detroit during a drill because the cop hadn't unloaded his MP5.
[01:18:30.327 --> 01:18:31.107]  Mainstream news.
[01:18:31.307 --> 01:18:32.347]  There's a bunch of other examples.
[01:18:35.068 --> 01:18:35.888]  I mean, it's normal.
[01:18:36.648 --> 01:18:37.349]  Oh, God, help me.
[01:18:38.749 --> 01:18:41.130]  I mean, I'm living in a giant re-education camp.
[01:18:41.490 --> 01:18:42.590]  So are you, see?
[01:18:43.230 --> 01:18:45.511]  And so they email us thinking killing everyone's normal.
[01:18:46.833 --> 01:18:47.753]  What's wrong with you?
[01:18:47.773 --> 01:18:49.234]  Of course we've all got to die.
[01:18:50.275 --> 01:18:51.176]  What's wrong with you?
[01:18:54.406 --> 01:18:56.748]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:18:56.988 --> 01:18:59.030]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:18:59.170 --> 01:19:06.217]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[01:19:06.497 --> 01:19:15.125]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[01:19:15.405 --> 01:19:20.009]  Now, for the first time, Calvin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[01:19:20.229 --> 01:19:24.274]  That's great news because Cal Bend Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients.
[01:19:24.454 --> 01:19:26.897]  It's earth friendly and completely environmentally safe.
[01:19:27.077 --> 01:19:31.422]  So if you want yesterday's values today for good old fashioned pure soap, call 1-800-340-7091.
[01:19:35.066 --> 01:19:35.406]  We're good to go.
[01:20:05.728 --> 01:20:06.168]  We're good to go.
[01:20:21.001 --> 01:20:21.661]  We're good to go.
[01:20:21.701 --> 01:20:22.282]  We're good to go.
[01:20:54.145 --> 01:21:02.772]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:21:02.992 --> 01:21:14.262]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:21:14.482 --> 01:21:17.124]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:21:17.464 --> 01:21:23.927]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled, and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:21:24.087 --> 01:21:25.948]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:21:26.148 --> 01:21:32.171]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[01:21:32.431 --> 01:21:38.094]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[01:21:38.414 --> 01:21:42.339]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:21:42.359 --> 01:21:43.060]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:43.781]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:21:54.346 --> 01:21:56.046]  What causes foods to spoil?
[01:21:56.466 --> 01:21:59.447]  All produce produces a natural gas which causes ripening.
[01:21:59.767 --> 01:22:05.048]  In addition, foods like onions and garlic emit odors, causing foods to lose their freshness and flavor.
[01:22:05.348 --> 01:22:14.890]  Now there's Forever Fresh for the fridge, a revolutionary new product proven to eliminate refrigerator odors and guaranteed to keep produce fresh at least twice as long as normal.
[01:22:15.170 --> 01:22:17.371]  Nancy McKimson of Jacksonville, Florida says...
[01:22:17.651 --> 01:22:21.213]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, everything stays fresh much longer.
[01:22:21.473 --> 01:22:24.695]  Like strawberries, which now last a couple of weeks instead of just a few days.
[01:22:24.975 --> 01:22:28.518]  Jane Burke of New Jersey says... You know, we eat a lot of salads.
[01:22:28.678 --> 01:22:32.140]  I used to throw out the leftovers because they'd turn brown and they'd shrivel up.
[01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:33.541]  I'm really amazed.
[01:22:33.701 --> 01:22:39.524]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, all my produce stays fresher longer, including the leftovers.
[01:22:39.684 --> 01:22:42.086]  Now I just couldn't get along without Forever Fresh.
[01:22:42.446 --> 01:22:50.577]  To order your Forever Fresh for the fridge, visit the web at foreverfresh.us or call toll-free 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[01:22:50.757 --> 01:22:52.759]  That's 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[01:22:53.721 --> 01:22:56.003]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:22:56.544 --> 01:22:59.328]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:04.631 --> 01:23:10.534]  You see, when they email us, when they call us, when they write papers, they're like, I can't believe everyone doesn't want to die.
[01:23:10.974 --> 01:23:12.115]  You people are nuts.
[01:23:12.895 --> 01:23:21.399]  See, to them, because everybody around them agrees, really, 95%, that's mainstream news now, in these cloistered areas, we're the kooks.
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:24.221]  Let's go ahead and talk to Paul.
[01:23:24.321 --> 01:23:27.062]  Paul, where are you calling us from?
[01:23:28.383 --> 01:23:29.103]  I'm in Canada.
[01:23:29.663 --> 01:23:33.025]  I called yesterday about the people...
[01:23:33.957 --> 01:23:35.478]  I'm having trouble understanding you, sir.
[01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:37.080]  Alex?
[01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:37.980]  Yes, sir.
[01:23:38.561 --> 01:23:41.563]  Yeah, I called yesterday about the port in Freeport.
[01:23:42.684 --> 01:23:44.245]  Yes, sir, and I told you to call back.
[01:23:45.206 --> 01:24:02.360]  Yeah, but firstly, though, I just wanted to, on the topic of today, that Ingrid Newkirk lady from PETA, she also thinks like that, and she said that the world would be an infinitely better place without humans at all, and that having purebred human kids is like having a purebred dog, and that we shouldn't do it.
[01:24:04.131 --> 01:24:08.513]  Sir, did you know that I can assure you that what you're saying is absolutely true?
[01:24:09.413 --> 01:24:18.296]  Because she's on record published saying that, and they're adherents of Dr. Peter Singer, who says that we should be able to kill our own children until age two.
[01:24:19.836 --> 01:24:21.657]  Yeah, that's disgusting.
[01:24:22.037 --> 01:24:25.478]  Now, I'm willing to have you on air, sir, but there's some kind of echo back over your phone.
[01:24:25.498 --> 01:24:27.059]  Maybe listeners aren't hearing it, but I'm hearing it.
[01:24:27.599 --> 01:24:28.039]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:24:28.079 --> 01:24:31.580]  It's a voice over IP phone, but I'll be quick, really.
[01:24:32.410 --> 01:24:38.415]  It's just that the AP also reported on March 28th that the U.S.
[01:24:38.455 --> 01:24:48.783]  will be putting custom inspectors in Freeport by the end of the year, that they're working the deals out with the government.
[01:24:49.044 --> 01:24:49.944]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:24:50.084 --> 01:25:01.694]  Are you saying the original AP article didn't say that it was a no-bid contract, that there would be no security guards, no customs there, and that Hutchinson Wampo, the Chinese company, would run it?
[01:25:02.722 --> 01:25:03.402]  No, that's the case.
[01:25:03.522 --> 01:25:04.083]  That's the case.
[01:25:04.603 --> 01:25:12.226]  It wasn't no big contract, but it's, um, that, like, you were saying that, like, the Chinese military and stuff will be running the port.
[01:25:12.246 --> 01:25:21.829]  Like, there are only 500 Hutchinson employees in Freeport, and 99% of them are Bahamian, and, like, the other 1% are British foreign nationals.
[01:25:22.830 --> 01:25:31.293]  Sir, are you denying the congressional report admitting that Hutchinson-Wampoa has a large portion is owned by the Chinese government, and that their ships are captained by members of the Chinese Navy?
[01:25:32.074 --> 01:25:43.098]  No, no, I'm not denying that the Hutchinson is partially owned by the Chinese military, especially in Panama, but in Freeport, that is not the case.
[01:25:43.178 --> 01:25:45.159]  It's co-owned by the Grand Bahama Port Authority.
[01:25:45.379 --> 01:25:48.680]  But secondly, Hutchinson-Wampoa does not actually have ships.
[01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:52.941]  It's Costco that is captained by Chinese Navy.
[01:25:53.641 --> 01:25:55.662]  Hutchinson-Wampoa is strictly a port operator.
[01:25:55.682 --> 01:25:56.442]  They only have cranes.
[01:25:56.462 --> 01:25:57.843]  They're not a shipping company.
[01:25:58.894 --> 01:25:59.555]  Well, that's funny.
[01:25:59.575 --> 01:26:03.799]  I've read they have a lot of ships, but of course you're right about Costco as well, and that's Chinese control.
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:05.381]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:26:05.401 --> 01:26:08.925]  I think we're arguing about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin here, my friend.
[01:26:09.626 --> 01:26:10.987]  Let's talk to Dino in Oregon.
[01:26:11.007 --> 01:26:11.928]  Dino, thanks for holding.
[01:26:11.948 --> 01:26:12.329]  Go ahead.
[01:26:14.131 --> 01:26:15.432]  He needs to turn his radio off.
[01:26:16.033 --> 01:26:16.834]  Put him back on hold.
[01:26:16.854 --> 01:26:17.735]  We'll go back to him later.
[01:26:19.208 --> 01:26:19.648]  Oh, boy.
[01:26:20.549 --> 01:26:22.250]  Michael in New York, you're on the air.
[01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.651]  Welcome.
[01:26:24.031 --> 01:26:24.492]  Another one.
[01:26:24.512 --> 01:26:25.372]  Put him on hold again.
[01:26:25.392 --> 01:26:28.154]  I tell you, folks, there's 101 in talk radio.
[01:26:28.555 --> 01:26:30.816]  Turn your radios off and listen.
[01:26:31.497 --> 01:26:35.559]  I'm not trying to be mean, but, I mean, this is unheard of to have caller after caller doing this.
[01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:37.641]  Steve in New York, you're on the air.
[01:26:37.681 --> 01:26:38.081]  Go ahead.
[01:26:39.142 --> 01:26:39.442]  Alex.
[01:26:39.742 --> 01:26:40.062]  Yes, sir.
[01:26:40.263 --> 01:26:40.803]  You got me.
[01:26:41.423 --> 01:26:41.624]  Yes, sir.
[01:26:41.644 --> 01:26:44.666]  I just want to thank you so much for your program and your show.
[01:26:44.766 --> 01:26:46.587]  There's a lot of listeners up in this area today.
[01:26:47.134 --> 01:26:48.635]  And personally, I want to thank you.
[01:26:48.655 --> 01:26:52.036]  You've been a godsend to me, my family, and a lot of friends in this area.
[01:26:52.896 --> 01:26:55.897]  And, hey, Alex, I just want to put it all on the table for you.
[01:26:57.618 --> 01:27:00.979]  I look at these elitists, these globalists, like a tree.
[01:27:01.039 --> 01:27:02.439]  You know, there's all these branches.
[01:27:02.459 --> 01:27:03.620]  You've got the CFR.
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:04.800]  You've got the Club of Rome.
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:11.382]  And everybody's picking a branch, and we're trying to knock it down from the branches down to the trunk of the tree.
[01:27:12.123 --> 01:27:15.724]  And I find out, as I study this new world order,
[01:27:16.354 --> 01:27:18.135]  I'm finding a big connection there.
[01:27:18.275 --> 01:27:29.302]  All these people, these globalists and elitists are all interconnected into one type of cultish... I'm looking at it from the outside, maybe.
[01:27:30.443 --> 01:27:35.466]  You might want to correct me on it, but they're all tied into this craft.
[01:27:35.786 --> 01:27:37.307]  And I come right down to it.
[01:27:37.608 --> 01:27:38.808]  Let me put it right down to it.
[01:27:39.148 --> 01:27:42.931]  They're all involved with this Masonic Order, this Masonic Lodge.
[01:27:43.883 --> 01:28:07.348]  And we're sitting there knocking down branches, and I think if we get to the point of it and we start chopping at these Masonic Lodges, every town's got one, every city has one, every state has these lodges, and we start exposing these people and letting the public know, hey, there's something going on in these things, and we need to expose these people, and maybe the media might pick up on it.
[01:28:07.408 --> 01:28:09.408]  I doubt it because they're all involved with it.
[01:28:09.955 --> 01:28:15.576]  But we've got to start someplace to start chopping the tree down at the trunk instead of knocking these branches down.
[01:28:15.677 --> 01:28:16.377]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:28:17.077 --> 01:28:19.558]  I hear you, sir, and I'll comment on what you've said when we get back.
[01:28:19.598 --> 01:28:20.498]  I appreciate the call.
[01:28:21.298 --> 01:28:24.899]  And then we'll go back and try to talk to Dino and Michael and others that have got their radios off.
[01:28:25.979 --> 01:28:27.740]  And then we'll talk to Patrick and many, many others.
[01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:28.760]  Toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:29.940]  A lot of other news coming up.
[01:28:33.698 --> 01:28:34.578]  More of your calls.
[01:28:34.758 --> 01:28:38.520]  I'm going to play a clip from JFK with Jim Garrison's Summations.
[01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:39.060]  Classic.
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:40.320]  We'll be playing that coming up.
[01:28:44.062 --> 01:28:44.962]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.462 --> 01:28:47.043]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.063 --> 01:28:50.664]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.968 --> 01:28:57.272]  And now a word from Dr. Patricia Margaitis from Stem Enhance.
[01:28:57.713 --> 01:29:01.858]  I want to first thank the wonderful GCN listeners for supporting Stem Enhance.
[01:29:02.399 --> 01:29:09.809]  Now know that your own stem cells are your body's maintenance group, and Stem Enhance makes sure that more of them show up for work every day.
[01:29:10.209 --> 01:29:14.213]  The truth is, the more stem cells you have in your bloodstream, the greater your health.
[01:29:14.593 --> 01:29:28.006]  If you believe there is something more for you, have a strong work ethic, and wish to participate in the monumental increase in the cause for natural health, while gaining financial independence and monthly cash flow, then you are the right person.
[01:29:28.446 --> 01:29:31.849]  I personally invite you to join me as a distributor of Stem & Hand.
[01:29:32.229 --> 01:29:36.472]  I am committed to personally make sure you receive the tools needed to succeed.
[01:29:36.832 --> 01:29:39.755]  Remember, the first rule of success, you must show up.
[01:29:39.915 --> 01:29:43.217]  Call me, Dr. Patricia Margaitis, at 860-567-7744.
[01:29:43.257 --> 01:29:44.758]  That number again, 860-567-7744.
[01:29:54.514 --> 01:29:57.498]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:29:57.859 --> 01:30:06.690]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:30:07.011 --> 01:30:11.677]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:30:12.137 --> 01:30:18.861]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:30:19.262 --> 01:30:31.029]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:30:31.509 --> 01:30:31.930]  We're good to go.
[01:30:55.885 --> 01:30:57.386]  Pain, illness, and disease.
[01:30:57.566 --> 01:31:00.728]  When natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach.
[01:31:00.928 --> 01:31:05.931]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[01:31:06.271 --> 01:31:14.175]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:14.335 --> 01:31:21.379]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:21.579 --> 01:31:22.801]  There are no side effects.
[01:31:22.961 --> 01:31:26.345]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:31:26.405 --> 01:31:29.088]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[01:31:29.288 --> 01:31:36.117]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:31:36.237 --> 01:31:38.700]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:41.861]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free 866-885-6625.
[01:31:41.881 --> 01:31:41.981]  866-885-6625.
[01:31:42.001 --> 01:31:42.601]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:31:42.661 --> 01:31:44.422]  Continuing with your phone calls here in just a moment.
[01:32:06.929 --> 01:32:11.313]  I want to answer that caller's question, though, about the Masons.
[01:32:13.435 --> 01:32:16.658]  People look at the New World Order, and then they will seize on one group.
[01:32:16.698 --> 01:32:25.826]  They'll say it's the Catholics, it's the Protestants, it's the Jews, it's the Masons, it's the Rosicrucians, it's the CFR, it's the Trilateral Commission.
[01:32:26.226 --> 01:32:29.109]  If you look at the membership of the Bilderberg Group, with only around 120 members...
[01:32:30.822 --> 01:32:31.222]  We're good to go.
[01:32:31.262 --> 01:32:31.922]  We're good to go.
[01:32:31.942 --> 01:32:32.382]  We're good to go.
[01:33:01.739 --> 01:33:03.840]  And they'll be members of the CFR.
[01:33:03.940 --> 01:33:10.944]  In fact, the chairman of the Bilderberg Group, his brother will be the chairman of the CFR, or the former president will.
[01:33:10.964 --> 01:33:13.765]  I mean, it's just they're all, it's the same crew.
[01:33:14.406 --> 01:33:17.387]  The people running the Trilateral Commission are on all the other groups.
[01:33:17.427 --> 01:33:18.108]  That's all they do.
[01:33:19.388 --> 01:33:23.690]  And they vacation about two or three months out of the year, and the rest of the time they just fly around managing everything.
[01:33:23.710 --> 01:33:24.511]  They work pretty hard.
[01:33:24.771 --> 01:33:25.992]  They also take a lot of vacations.
[01:33:27.032 --> 01:33:28.273]  But when they are working, they're working.
[01:33:29.633 --> 01:33:30.654]  You can't say they're lazy.
[01:33:31.241 --> 01:33:33.262]  Controlling us, dominating us, they're really into it.
[01:33:34.623 --> 01:33:37.185]  And you have to know the history of the Masons.
[01:33:38.966 --> 01:33:56.816]  He goes back to the secrets of mathematics and construction, because if you knew how to build cathedrals, you knew how to build temples, you knew how to build pyramids going back, you knew how to build ziggurats, you were going to become very wealthy and powerful, so these secret universities or mystery schools guarded that, and they were the first intelligence agencies.
[01:33:57.216 --> 01:33:58.158]  And power always stayed in those hands.
[01:33:58.178 --> 01:34:00.181]  It's like a university in Europe might be 800 years old.
[01:34:10.686 --> 01:34:13.007]  And people go, well, how does it keep passing on its ideas?
[01:34:13.047 --> 01:34:18.630]  Well, it's just people sit in the positions of power, and they hand it off as they die or retire to their servants and their minions.
[01:34:18.670 --> 01:34:23.292]  And it just has a life of its own, and it grows like an organism or like a person.
[01:34:23.713 --> 01:34:25.874]  Corporations, you know, they say are, quote, people.
[01:34:26.534 --> 01:34:27.695]  They have their own identities.
[01:34:28.875 --> 01:34:31.456]  And so most Masons are what you call porch Masons.
[01:34:33.417 --> 01:34:37.560]  Even 32nd degree Masons don't know one one-hundredth of the secrets.
[01:34:38.660 --> 01:34:40.321]  And they get very angry if you do talk about them.
[01:34:41.418 --> 01:34:45.982]  And so a lot of the Founding Fathers were Masons, a lot of the founders of Texas were Masons, but they were not evil Masons.
[01:34:46.022 --> 01:34:50.826]  And later they wrote about, quote, this dark Masonry, this Illuminati trying to take it over.
[01:34:51.407 --> 01:34:59.734]  Anything secret with a lot of power is going to be a prime plum for organized crime to infiltrate and use.
[01:35:01.685 --> 01:35:04.347]  And, you know, the Masons have always been corrupt.
[01:35:04.647 --> 01:35:06.168]  They've always scratched each other's backs.
[01:35:06.188 --> 01:35:08.489]  They've always let each other off for murder.
[01:35:08.549 --> 01:35:09.950]  Most judges are high-level Masons.
[01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:11.191]  They're big judges.
[01:35:12.011 --> 01:35:14.012]  And that's all been documented historically.
[01:35:14.472 --> 01:35:16.474]  So, yes, it's very dangerous.
[01:35:16.514 --> 01:35:17.354]  It's very serious.
[01:35:17.474 --> 01:35:20.536]  But you've got to add the caveat that they're not all evil because...
[01:35:21.249 --> 01:35:23.630]  The average Mason listening right now is like, what are you talking about?
[01:35:24.131 --> 01:35:39.238]  All I do is volunteer and give money for multiple sclerosis or cirrhosis, or all I do is give money for burn victims, or all I do is get out there and, you know, take care of people.
[01:35:39.758 --> 01:35:44.561]  And because they are good people, and they've been co-opted, and their money and their energy is used as part of this front.
[01:35:46.167 --> 01:35:53.412]  But to say Masons run everything, I think the Masons are just one more branch of this mystery religion, you know, ancient crime syndicate.
[01:35:55.694 --> 01:35:57.335]  And so I expose all these groups.
[01:35:57.555 --> 01:36:01.117]  You've got evil people in control of every major denomination, every major group.
[01:36:01.137 --> 01:36:02.478]  That's why they're in power.
[01:36:03.759 --> 01:36:12.485]  And then there's other people who just want, who are in this for egomania, who will demand that, no Alex, you must say it's the Jews and only the Jews.
[01:36:13.101 --> 01:36:15.422]  Or no, Alex, you must say it's the whites and only the whites.
[01:36:15.962 --> 01:36:19.363]  You know, if you're somebody like a UT professor at Arlington who says all the whites need to be killed.
[01:36:19.944 --> 01:36:22.985]  Or no, Alex, you know, it's all the Catholics.
[01:36:23.685 --> 01:36:26.246]  No, it's every major group being infiltrated.
[01:36:26.366 --> 01:36:27.346]  Governments are evil.
[01:36:27.386 --> 01:36:28.227]  Governments are corrupt.
[01:36:28.587 --> 01:36:31.828]  You've got to control them and watch them and keep them small, as the Founding Fathers said.
[01:36:32.466 --> 01:36:33.167]  So watch out.
[01:36:33.187 --> 01:36:34.189]  I think the caller brought up a good point.
[01:36:34.209 --> 01:36:34.910]  I'm not knocking him.
[01:36:35.230 --> 01:36:35.831]  But watch out.
[01:36:35.891 --> 01:36:44.583]  Anybody that says, you know, I've got all the answers and it's just this one group and everybody else is bad, they're not giving you the answers.
[01:36:44.663 --> 01:36:45.845]  Because there's a lot of it out there.
[01:36:46.105 --> 01:36:47.747]  And it's really just sectarianism.
[01:36:49.062 --> 01:36:50.702]  It's infighting.
[01:36:50.742 --> 01:36:53.263]  It's pole position behavior.
[01:36:53.343 --> 01:36:54.323]  And it's very destructive.
[01:36:54.343 --> 01:37:01.164]  And then these poor people out there that want power in the truth movement, they don't understand that they would gain it if they were in it for the right reasons.
[01:37:01.824 --> 01:37:04.385]  And with great power comes great responsibilities, as they say.
[01:37:04.965 --> 01:37:06.985]  And they were reaching out to everyone.
[01:37:07.885 --> 01:37:09.746]  So they destroy themselves in the end.
[01:37:10.746 --> 01:37:12.486]  Let's go to Dino in Oregon.
[01:37:12.506 --> 01:37:13.746]  Dino, are you there this time?
[01:37:15.047 --> 01:37:15.187]  Hello?
[01:37:16.187 --> 01:37:16.507]  Yes, sir.
[01:37:17.087 --> 01:37:17.407]  Hi, Alex.
[01:37:17.447 --> 01:37:17.787]  How are you?
[01:37:18.812 --> 01:37:18.932]  Good.
[01:37:18.952 --> 01:37:20.433]  I'm going to have to let you go, though.
[01:37:20.473 --> 01:37:21.754]  You've got your radio on, don't you?
[01:37:22.254 --> 01:37:25.056]  No, my television's on downstairs.
[01:37:25.096 --> 01:37:25.796]  I'm away from it now.
[01:37:25.857 --> 01:37:26.337]  Okay, fine.
[01:37:26.357 --> 01:37:28.078]  It's hard to talk to you when there's background.
[01:37:28.098 --> 01:37:28.698]  Go ahead.
[01:37:29.099 --> 01:37:31.880]  No, we've been listening to you for a while, and we're from Eugene.
[01:37:31.940 --> 01:37:36.603]  This is a place where self-sustainability is the key, and we see the incoming.
[01:37:37.604 --> 01:37:46.810]  One of the big suggestions we have is to start telling people to quit buying corporate food, corporate clothes, start making your own stuff, start growing your own stuff.
[01:37:48.573 --> 01:37:53.175]  Well, they've even tried to pass laws in Portland restricting your own personal gardens.
[01:37:54.276 --> 01:37:57.177]  Oh, yeah, that happens all the time, Alex.
[01:37:57.598 --> 01:38:02.600]  David Rovick has a song about gardens that were destroyed by the officials in Brooklyn.
[01:38:03.801 --> 01:38:13.426]  Now, so where you live in Eugene, Oregon, I know Portland's the center of evil, but where you're living there, I mean, do you run into the people that say we've all got to die?
[01:38:14.542 --> 01:38:16.425]  No, I mean, I can understand those people.
[01:38:17.066 --> 01:38:19.549]  You know, they're not looking at reality.
[01:38:19.709 --> 01:38:22.013]  Whatever we can do, we can do now.
[01:38:22.053 --> 01:38:25.417]  We don't have to fantasize about people dying and things dying.
[01:38:25.718 --> 01:38:30.645]  We are on a planet that's dying, and if we don't do something about it now, we need the answers, like you said.
[01:38:32.819 --> 01:38:46.092]  Well, that's the point I make, is the very crowd that's saying, the Earth is dying, it's our fault, we've all got to die, they're the very ones, the very elites that are pushing their view are the ones that are dumping nerve gas in the ocean, and they're dumping it in the Delaware River.
[01:38:46.312 --> 01:38:48.834]  They're the ones releasing uranium all over the planet.
[01:38:49.014 --> 01:38:50.556]  Why don't we all stop paying taxes?
[01:38:50.656 --> 01:38:55.160]  Why don't we continue to participate with these people who want to destroy us all?
[01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:56.962]  I don't understand why we allow them...
[01:38:57.415 --> 01:38:58.856]  To have control over our food.
[01:38:59.276 --> 01:39:02.078]  I mean, if we all stopped paying taxes today, it would end today.
[01:39:02.519 --> 01:39:08.523]  Well, sir, I mean, I'm fighting right now against the Premises ID and the Animal ID Act.
[01:39:08.543 --> 01:39:11.265]  I mean, we're fighting on every front we can, sir.
[01:39:12.206 --> 01:39:18.550]  Well, I just think we need to grow our own, and we need to realize there's no ghosts, goblins, gods, or mysterious things.
[01:39:18.610 --> 01:39:19.871]  Science proves it all out.
[01:39:20.952 --> 01:39:25.335]  If the supernatural were true, the natural world wouldn't exist anymore.
[01:39:26.486 --> 01:39:27.367]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:39:27.387 --> 01:39:30.130]  The elite are obsessed with the occult.
[01:39:30.410 --> 01:39:32.432]  Do you think it's bad that we report on that?
[01:39:32.952 --> 01:39:34.734]  No, I don't think it's bad that we report on that.
[01:39:34.774 --> 01:39:37.136]  I think that we need to focus on ignoring them.
[01:39:37.396 --> 01:39:39.118]  We know the truth.
[01:39:39.298 --> 01:39:46.805]  The answer is we need to turn our backs on groups like that, and we need to become more of a community.
[01:39:48.570 --> 01:39:50.211]  But not communities steered by them.
[01:39:50.231 --> 01:39:55.496]  You know, they're at the head of trying to get little, quote, communities, but really those are control arms.
[01:39:55.856 --> 01:40:01.420]  The thing about Eugene, Oregon that's special and the reason we moved here is because there is a sustainable effort.
[01:40:01.460 --> 01:40:03.662]  There are people turning their grasses into gardens.
[01:40:04.242 --> 01:40:08.346]  I cut out eight by six patch of grass and turned it into a food making place.
[01:40:09.026 --> 01:40:10.948]  And, you know, you've got to start somewhere.
[01:40:10.968 --> 01:40:11.969]  You've got to plant a seed.
[01:40:12.009 --> 01:40:12.309]  You've got to
[01:40:12.788 --> 01:40:14.390]  Cut yourself off from there.
[01:40:14.530 --> 01:40:16.131]  Well, sir, I have eggplants.
[01:40:16.291 --> 01:40:17.072]  I have rutabagas.
[01:40:17.172 --> 01:40:17.953]  I have radishes.
[01:40:18.093 --> 01:40:18.774]  I have onions.
[01:40:19.254 --> 01:40:20.475]  I have tomatoes.
[01:40:21.036 --> 01:40:24.219]  I have a bunch of other stuff growing in a tiny plot in my backyard.
[01:40:24.579 --> 01:40:27.222]  That's the way to do it because it starts with just one seed.
[01:40:27.242 --> 01:40:37.932]  I don't know if you've seen anything by Rabinowitz, but he talks about self-sustainability and living as brothers and sisters as opposed to fighting all the time with separations.
[01:40:38.553 --> 01:40:46.316]  But do you realize that Agenda 21 and Goals 2000 is pushing their own, quote, sustainable system, and that means stealing your private property.
[01:40:46.336 --> 01:40:49.097]  It's all our word, because they don't know sustainability.
[01:40:49.117 --> 01:40:53.658]  Sustainability means life without organized governments or religions.
[01:40:55.959 --> 01:40:56.579]  We don't need them.
[01:40:56.939 --> 01:40:57.439]  They need us.
[01:40:59.180 --> 01:41:01.221]  Sir, you say the TV's on in the background.
[01:41:01.261 --> 01:41:02.601]  I hear myself in the background.
[01:41:03.701 --> 01:41:04.662]  I appreciate your call.
[01:41:04.682 --> 01:41:05.482]  Look, guys...
[01:41:06.559 --> 01:41:08.381]  I'm not trying to be mean or an old grouch here.
[01:41:08.421 --> 01:41:12.805]  You call in any other talk show with the radio in the background, and they're going to shut you off.
[01:41:14.146 --> 01:41:14.527]  Okay?
[01:41:15.067 --> 01:41:17.109]  And I just, you've got to turn them off.
[01:41:18.090 --> 01:41:18.651]  I'm serious.
[01:41:20.157 --> 01:41:21.938]  I don't know how you mix no religion into that.
[01:41:22.178 --> 01:41:25.240]  There's this line that religion has caused the problems.
[01:41:25.461 --> 01:41:30.664]  No, governments have used religion, and they've used new atheistic religions.
[01:41:31.084 --> 01:41:31.645]  What is that?
[01:41:31.665 --> 01:41:38.129]  Well, that is bioethicist and the eugenics movement and this modern ecology and the rest of it.
[01:41:39.530 --> 01:41:40.631]  Dino, it's nice talking to you.
[01:41:40.691 --> 01:41:42.832]  You can't call in if you don't turn your radio off.
[01:41:43.392 --> 01:41:44.853]  Patrick in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:41:44.893 --> 01:41:45.554]  Go ahead, Patrick.
[01:41:49.813 --> 01:41:50.934]  All right, Matt Patrick's not there.
[01:41:50.954 --> 01:42:00.744]  I want to respond to something that that gentleman said, and that was about religions and gods and he can fertile his own land.
[01:42:00.784 --> 01:42:10.072]  He has all the right ideas, but I think like many people in the truth movement or any other movement, God created the seed and God waters the grass.
[01:42:10.192 --> 01:42:14.797]  And if you start to forget about that and think that you're that self-sufficient, you're going to find yourself
[01:42:15.885 --> 01:42:16.345]  We're good to go.
[01:42:38.314 --> 01:42:46.995]  You know, I would like to hear from the listeners about when they went to school, when they went to college, what they heard their professors saying about all this.
[01:42:47.015 --> 01:42:55.517]  And I'd like to ask the callers, you can talk about whatever you want, but I'd specifically like to get your view on what Dr. Eric Pianca and his disciples are out saying.
[01:42:55.937 --> 01:42:57.657]  Well, my view on that is this.
[01:42:58.337 --> 01:43:01.398]  This is why I lead into... They're of their father who loves death.
[01:43:01.498 --> 01:43:02.898]  They're of their father who loves death.
[01:43:03.058 --> 01:43:07.439]  And if you read the Old Testament, Alex, which I know you don't comment on this a ton, but I know...
[01:43:08.257 --> 01:43:09.798]  That you have commented on it some.
[01:43:10.259 --> 01:43:14.142]  People who say we need no government, that's not the way our fathers set it up.
[01:43:14.182 --> 01:43:15.023]  There was a government.
[01:43:15.043 --> 01:43:16.504]  It was the Levitical priesthood.
[01:43:16.524 --> 01:43:17.905]  It was extremely limited.
[01:43:17.985 --> 01:43:21.828]  But you can't say you don't need a government because the creators set one up.
[01:43:21.968 --> 01:43:22.669]  It was limited.
[01:43:23.129 --> 01:43:24.410]  And we've abolished that now.
[01:43:24.470 --> 01:43:29.294]  When the founding fathers started the country... Yeah, we're going to have a government.
[01:43:29.334 --> 01:43:31.116]  Will it be God's law or man's law?
[01:43:31.536 --> 01:43:31.956]  Exactly.
[01:43:31.977 --> 01:43:35.920]  I think it was Andrew Jackson who said that the country should be...
[01:43:36.528 --> 01:43:41.212]  Well, I mean, it wasn't really a question as it is now.
[01:43:41.232 --> 01:43:42.313]  It wasn't a question back then.
[01:43:42.333 --> 01:43:43.554]  That's certainly the way that it was.
[01:43:43.594 --> 01:43:47.697]  But we're so regulated by everything that we don't really rely on God anymore.
[01:43:47.717 --> 01:43:57.225]  And then you have all these other groups who think they're all part of the movement, and yet they say, well, I'm working God's power and all these kind of... And listen, I'm not going to beat around the bush about it.
[01:43:57.605 --> 01:44:02.169]  If the Heavenly Father isn't on your side, the Ten Commandments isn't what you're living by,
[01:44:02.782 --> 01:44:03.882]  You're going to be deceived.
[01:44:03.902 --> 01:44:05.163]  You're going to have a problem.
[01:44:05.223 --> 01:44:08.544]  I'm sorry if that offends people out there, but that's the way that it is.
[01:44:08.584 --> 01:44:13.905]  You're wrapped up in some kind of deception because the devil comes and makes people think they have some kind of power.
[01:44:14.325 --> 01:44:20.287]  And as far as your voiceovers, Alex, or your imitations, let me just say one.
[01:44:20.307 --> 01:44:23.188]  They're hysterical and they bring some levity to a tense situation.
[01:44:23.228 --> 01:44:26.709]  But I think what people need to understand about that also, Alex, is it isn't just...
[01:44:28.157 --> 01:44:31.498]  I mean, I know you get this, but it isn't just you doing a little voiceover.
[01:44:31.578 --> 01:44:33.319]  It really represents a mindset.
[01:44:33.619 --> 01:44:37.861]  It totally does when you do the intellectual voice and then the redneck voice.
[01:44:38.441 --> 01:44:46.224]  I grew up up north in New York, so I can really tune in to what you're saying when you talk about the academia intellect voice.
[01:44:46.264 --> 01:44:50.186]  You know, you, Alex, why don't you just drink your latte, and you're so base.
[01:44:50.666 --> 01:44:54.148]  Just read your Wall Street Journal, and don't worry about it, Alex.
[01:44:54.208 --> 01:44:57.189]  I mean, people think they're really plugged into something,
[01:44:57.754 --> 01:44:59.215]  And there's two types of deceptions.
[01:44:59.496 --> 01:45:07.983]  One group thinks, well, I'm not a Bush supporter, so I'm just so plugged into the stock market, and I'm just so deep, and I wear my moccasins.
[01:45:08.263 --> 01:45:12.646]  It really is a mindset that people need to get over, because you're just as deceived.
[01:45:12.706 --> 01:45:16.750]  As a matter of fact, if you're one of those people, the redneck can sustain himself.
[01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:22.915]  He can probably hunt and fish, and growing up around all these intellectuals, they think they know everything, and they don't really know anything.
[01:45:23.215 --> 01:45:23.856]  They'll use buzzwords.
[01:45:27.170 --> 01:45:29.471]  They'll go, you don't have any science.
[01:45:29.752 --> 01:45:31.333]  You're just an idiot.
[01:45:32.073 --> 01:45:34.074]  And they're on a power trip.
[01:45:34.194 --> 01:45:36.376]  I know that I don't know very much.
[01:45:37.036 --> 01:45:40.638]  And that scares me to see people that know almost nothing who think they know everything.
[01:45:40.838 --> 01:45:41.899]  But that's the key.
[01:45:41.979 --> 01:45:47.402]  When I realized that that is wisdom, like it says in the Word of God.
[01:45:47.562 --> 01:45:51.285]  If you act like you know something, man is nothing on this earth.
[01:45:51.305 --> 01:45:52.185]  He doesn't know anything.
[01:45:52.225 --> 01:45:53.646]  He knows what he's allowed to know.
[01:45:53.766 --> 01:45:55.207]  Now people take that
[01:45:55.712 --> 01:45:56.272]  I think so.
[01:46:15.256 --> 01:46:17.938]  I mean, it's just insane to me that people can be that way.
[01:46:17.978 --> 01:46:21.520]  Well, then these people get threats, they claim, and they send me emails.
[01:46:21.900 --> 01:46:23.241]  They say they want to get me.
[01:46:23.281 --> 01:46:24.341]  My life's in danger.
[01:46:24.361 --> 01:46:25.202]  I'm like, well, what do you mean?
[01:46:25.242 --> 01:46:26.642]  You're saying our life's in danger.
[01:46:27.023 --> 01:46:28.484]  You're saying our life's worth nothing.
[01:46:30.425 --> 01:46:34.447]  It's totally, but I think people need to understand that when you do that voice and then the other voice...
[01:46:35.293 --> 01:46:35.954]  It's my favorite.
[01:46:35.994 --> 01:46:38.257]  I'm from New York, so I can't really do that one too well.
[01:46:38.478 --> 01:46:39.739]  Well, I can do the New York voice.
[01:46:40.380 --> 01:46:41.782]  Yeah, I mean, you do the New York voice.
[01:46:41.802 --> 01:46:43.264]  Listen, I like George Bush.
[01:46:43.284 --> 01:46:44.486]  He's pretty good.
[01:46:46.048 --> 01:46:47.250]  That's a certain New York voice.
[01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:50.935]  Yeah, but the intellectual New York, you know, in New York City is the real...
[01:46:52.266 --> 01:46:57.931]  Well, New England has the Atlantic accent, really the British accent, like Chairman King.
[01:46:58.291 --> 01:47:01.094]  I don't think you quite understand that.
[01:47:01.134 --> 01:47:08.020]  But see, Alex, these people grow up, they're not from Britain, and yet somehow they develop this tone, and they just act like this, and they talk like this.
[01:47:08.396 --> 01:47:24.348]  And it's so fake, but as years have listened to this, I think it might be either something spiritual or just develops because they really start believing that they're part of this society, which, you know, I mean, half of them haven't grown up anywhere near Britain, so how they developed this accent is amazing to me.
[01:47:24.408 --> 01:47:27.130]  But I just wanted to say I appreciate what you're doing.
[01:47:27.150 --> 01:47:32.994]  I keep in my prayers, and if we turn back to God and stop having the government regulate us, but we do need...
[01:47:34.148 --> 01:47:34.629]  I hear you.
[01:47:34.769 --> 01:47:36.850]  I appreciate the call, Patrick.
[01:47:37.271 --> 01:47:38.231]  Mike in Louisiana.
[01:47:38.251 --> 01:47:38.992]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:47:39.032 --> 01:47:39.432]  Go ahead.
[01:47:40.793 --> 01:47:41.574]  Hello, Alex.
[01:47:41.834 --> 01:47:42.154]  Yes, sir.
[01:47:43.815 --> 01:47:59.207]  Just called to tell you I was listening to one of those neocons in my car as I was driving along yesterday, and he was talking about these, I don't know if it was Hannity or one of them, and he was...
[01:48:00.379 --> 01:48:11.905]  He was taking the side of these Dubai port things, these good Arabs that are so much of our allies and friends and all such as that.
[01:48:12.565 --> 01:48:16.347]  And he says, oh, but we don't want them to run our ports.
[01:48:16.747 --> 01:48:18.228]  They've got so much money.
[01:48:18.868 --> 01:48:25.992]  He says, well, his implication was, well, if we're stupid enough not to let
[01:48:31.472 --> 01:48:40.118]  Well, do you understand the economics, why they're doing this?
[01:48:40.379 --> 01:48:42.720]  The dollar's been devalued by over 40%.
[01:48:42.861 --> 01:48:43.961]  They're holding dollars.
[01:48:46.043 --> 01:48:49.406]  And so they need to be able to spend those dollars to dump those dollars.
[01:48:51.507 --> 01:48:52.468]  And so that's what's happening.
[01:48:53.473 --> 01:48:57.875]  But it's not 6, it's 21, and now it turns out they're still going to give it to them, see?
[01:48:58.296 --> 01:49:00.757]  The government just tells them what we want to hear, and they just keep going.
[01:49:01.197 --> 01:49:14.104]  No one in Texas, like 97% in polls, in most of the states, it's 93% in Austin because of fruitcakes who love enslavement, are against these new transponder control grids, but they're just announcing they're just going to do it.
[01:49:17.285 --> 01:49:22.488]  So how are we a free society when we don't want something, but the government just says we're going to do it anyways?
[01:49:24.821 --> 01:49:26.963]  I appreciate your call, Mike.
[01:49:27.623 --> 01:49:28.804]  Jeff and others, you're up next.
[01:49:28.864 --> 01:49:33.047]  And then I'm going to get into Professor gets a FBI visit, Bianca.
[01:49:34.528 --> 01:49:36.970]  The illegal aliens are saying, of course we wave our Mexican flags.
[01:49:37.830 --> 01:49:39.491]  But it doesn't mean we want to take over.
[01:49:39.651 --> 01:49:41.673]  No, your signs just say that in Spanish.
[01:49:42.353 --> 01:49:43.394]  So we'll get into that as well.
[01:49:43.774 --> 01:49:44.775]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:49:44.795 --> 01:49:46.136]  We'll be right back after this quick break.

[01:50:05.225 --> 01:50:11.950]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:12.290 --> 01:50:14.272]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:14.472 --> 01:50:17.315]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:17.395 --> 01:50:22.059]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:22.279 --> 01:50:26.683]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight, piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.923 --> 01:50:34.170]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:52:26.681 --> 01:52:26.982]  I think?
[01:53:16.713 --> 01:53:27.198]  In the next hour, I'm going to play about an eight-minute piece from JFK, Oliver Stone's film, with a summation of Jim Garrison played by, I think in his best role, Kevin Costner.
[01:53:28.459 --> 01:53:29.339]  I, by the way, like Kevin Costner.
[01:53:29.359 --> 01:53:30.199]  I think he's a great actor.
[01:53:30.219 --> 01:53:35.842]  A lot of good films like No Way Out and Open Range, but side issue.
[01:53:36.943 --> 01:53:37.743]  We're going to play that.
[01:53:38.243 --> 01:53:40.544]  I'm going to get more into some of the international and national news.
[01:53:40.564 --> 01:53:42.905]  In fact, I'll start the next hour doing that if we take some more calls.
[01:53:43.306 --> 01:53:44.166]  At the eight after, I will.
[01:53:45.445 --> 01:53:50.488]  And just briefly, just for a few more days, we're going to run the PrisonPlanet.tv special.
[01:53:51.449 --> 01:53:52.669]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:53:54.190 --> 01:53:55.331]  It's 15 cents a day.

[01:54:03.296 --> 01:54:04.256]  It's 5.3 months.
[01:54:04.737 --> 01:54:08.159]  Free when you get a yearly membership.

[01:54:27.588 --> 01:54:28.268]  It's nine now.
[01:54:28.288 --> 01:54:30.329]  One of them is going to another job and we'll have another tenth soon.
[01:54:32.561 --> 01:54:33.782]  And we need your support.
[01:54:33.823 --> 01:54:36.265]  A great way to do it is to get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[01:54:36.285 --> 01:54:39.828]  Plus, it's such a great activist tool to download all my films and give them to people.
[01:54:39.868 --> 01:54:40.969]  My book, Paul Watson's book.
[01:54:41.350 --> 01:54:46.435]  My weekly TV show, in-studio video interviews, a bunch of other films like Loose Change 2 and others.
[01:54:46.915 --> 01:54:49.718]  The American Union by Robert Galen Ross.
[01:54:49.738 --> 01:54:56.725]  We're going to put up the interview he also did with the late mistress of the video interview he did with the late mistress of LBJ.
[01:54:57.600 --> 01:55:01.244]  So all this and more is going up and is up on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:55:01.284 --> 01:55:01.824]  Take advantage.
[01:55:01.864 --> 01:55:04.687]  Only a few more days to get over five months free.
[01:55:04.827 --> 01:55:05.548]  Take advantage.
[01:55:06.187 --> 01:55:06.867]  Hi, how you doing?
[01:55:06.887 --> 01:55:07.728]  Good, sir.
[01:55:34.966 --> 01:55:35.346]  Good, good.
[01:55:35.847 --> 01:55:42.430]  Okay, I'm calling in about something that may annoy the hell out of you, but I'm not planning to do that.
[01:55:43.151 --> 01:55:48.934]  It's just that I really do respect you, and I know that... I'm just not sure about something, okay?
[01:55:49.894 --> 01:55:53.116]  There's a man in France that you know who says things about you.
[01:55:53.136 --> 01:55:57.619]  Now, the thing is, I know that on your...
[01:55:58.703 --> 01:55:59.824]  presentplanet.tv.
[01:55:59.924 --> 01:56:08.552]  I've downloaded lots of programs, one from a prayer network, and it deals with a bit of the Jewish conspiracy.
[01:56:08.952 --> 01:56:09.372]  Okay?
[01:56:10.173 --> 01:56:15.998]  Now, he seems to be going completely wild at you because you're not exposing them enough.
[01:56:16.559 --> 01:56:24.185]  Now, as far as I know, you've exposed the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers and lots of other people like that.
[01:56:25.266 --> 01:56:25.407]  And...
[01:56:27.173 --> 01:56:32.097]  I mean, of these 15 families, how many of them are Jewish?
[01:56:32.998 --> 01:56:34.059]  I appreciate your call.
[01:56:34.199 --> 01:56:44.228]  I would have to say that about six of the 15 ruling families claim they're Jewish, but they're all intermarried with Saxe-Coburg-Gotha's, Germans, and others.
[01:56:44.948 --> 01:56:47.030]  And, sir, it just minimizes our movement.
[01:56:47.050 --> 01:56:51.674]  That's why the feds, in fact, I've got Zionist documents saying they want people to say it's a Jewish conspiracy.
[01:56:51.914 --> 01:56:52.815]  That's all public, by the way.
[01:56:53.374 --> 01:56:54.074]  Go look it up.
[01:56:54.114 --> 01:56:55.294]  They want us to say that.
[01:56:55.354 --> 01:56:56.715]  They want us to attack Jews.
[01:56:57.095 --> 01:56:59.695]  And then that neutralizes everybody waking up and getting involved.
[01:57:00.275 --> 01:57:01.376]  It's European elite.
[01:57:01.456 --> 01:57:08.977]  And obviously, one of the dominant groups in the European elite are the Khazarian Jews, who aren't even really Jewish.
[01:57:09.977 --> 01:57:11.338]  And I've had Galen Ross in here about it.
[01:57:11.358 --> 01:57:12.298]  I've had scholars on.
[01:57:12.878 --> 01:57:14.818]  Sir, I could do that 24 hours a day.
[01:57:14.878 --> 01:57:15.739]  Those people would attack me.
[01:57:16.219 --> 01:57:18.419]  And I think you need to look at who the accusers are.
[01:57:19.579 --> 01:57:20.820]  They're probably not feds, though.
[01:57:21.080 --> 01:57:22.840]  Most of that's done just for detention, sir.
[01:57:23.849 --> 01:57:24.829]  I mean, that's what people do.
[01:57:25.490 --> 01:57:31.212]  They attack the big boy on the block, and I'm the big boy on the block, so I'm going to get attacked.
[01:57:33.633 --> 01:57:38.496]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:38.516 --> 01:57:38.836]  Big Brother
[01:57:51.383 --> 01:57:52.444]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.165 --> 01:57:54.366]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.926 --> 01:57:55.787]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.507 --> 01:57:57.488]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.089 --> 01:58:02.032]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.252 --> 01:58:03.814]  And now, it's Jones.
[01:58:03.914 --> 01:58:05.175]  Music
[01:58:21.784 --> 01:58:24.965]  Welcome back, now into hour number three already.
[01:58:25.045 --> 01:58:29.967]  Coming up, headline, protesters defend carrying Mexican flags.
[01:58:30.027 --> 01:58:32.968]  How dare us say it's bad that they say they want to take over.
[01:58:33.008 --> 01:58:40.230]  Again, not all Mexicans, not all Latin Americans, but a large portion of the illegals say this and push this and do this, and we're going to talk about it.
[01:58:41.326 --> 01:58:42.607]  Also more on Dr. Death.
[01:58:42.987 --> 01:58:44.568]  Professor Doom, whatever you want to call him.
[01:58:45.049 --> 01:58:46.530]  Pianca, Eric Pianca.
[01:58:46.970 --> 01:58:49.352]  Professor, his population speech is unnerved some.
[01:58:49.372 --> 01:58:50.773]  He gets a visit from the FBI.
[01:58:51.273 --> 01:58:52.374]  This is out of a local paper.
[01:58:53.772 --> 01:58:56.275]  And we'll get into just a host of other issues.
[01:58:56.935 --> 01:58:58.797]  I'm continuing right now with your calls.
[01:58:59.318 --> 01:59:03.462]  Let's go ahead and talk to Michael, who's been holding patiently, in New York.
[01:59:03.522 --> 01:59:04.223]  Go ahead, Michael.
[01:59:04.703 --> 01:59:05.404]  Hello, Alex.
[01:59:05.744 --> 01:59:06.805]  Great show as always.
[01:59:06.825 --> 01:59:08.367]  God bless you for everything you're doing.
[01:59:08.547 --> 01:59:08.887]  Thank you.
[01:59:08.987 --> 01:59:12.271]  Before I get to the new Atlantis, which I really want to discuss with you,
[01:59:12.711 --> 01:59:16.435]  I got a comment on that guy from Oregon with the science.
[01:59:16.475 --> 01:59:21.741]  He's obviously an amateur scientist, if he is a scientist, because science does prove there's God.
[01:59:22.262 --> 01:59:25.105]  And the supernatural realm is the real realm.
[01:59:25.245 --> 01:59:31.732]  And the natural world we occupy is a fallen, shadowy derivative of the supernatural realm.
[01:59:32.282 --> 01:59:33.043]  I think we're good to go.
[01:59:47.356 --> 01:59:59.602]  Is that Bacon, Roger, and Francis Bacon, who discuss the New Atlantis, they were actually referring to the future new golden age, and it was going to emerge in the new United States of America.
[01:59:59.642 --> 02:00:03.244]  No, I know, sir, and that's the new film I'm carrying that is spot on.
[02:00:03.284 --> 02:00:04.124]  It's so good.
[02:00:04.684 --> 02:00:07.205]  It is America's Beginnings, the New Atlantis, Volume 1.
[02:00:07.486 --> 02:00:09.206]  We're carrying it at InfoAwards.com.
[02:00:09.386 --> 02:00:10.667]  Oh, Alex, gee, that's great.
[02:00:10.707 --> 02:00:14.589]  Now, I wish I had a chance to run this by you before you even started that project, because...
[02:00:15.449 --> 02:00:34.481]  I don't know if you're aware of the fact that beginning in the late 1800s with greats like Nikola Tesla, great inventions, free energy, anti-gravity, all in existence, wireless communication, wireless electricity, all in existence just at the turn of the 20th century proving
[02:00:35.089 --> 02:00:36.811]  That the golden age was commencing.
[02:00:37.071 --> 02:00:38.152]  God's golden age.
[02:00:38.252 --> 02:00:46.280]  And obviously the devil stopped Tesla and all these other great inventors from getting their technologies to the public so we could benefit.
[02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:48.922]  There would have never been pollution, no animal suffering.
[02:00:48.962 --> 02:00:51.244]  We all could live anywhere we want, come and go.
[02:00:52.005 --> 02:00:56.069]  We would be in total harmony with nature in God's perfect order.
[02:00:56.549 --> 02:00:56.890]  And so...
[02:00:57.828 --> 02:00:58.949]  Obviously, we're not there.
[02:00:59.289 --> 02:01:05.534]  We're in a trapped technology that they control us with, and it pollutes and destroys everything, and they manipulate us with it.
[02:01:05.995 --> 02:01:12.680]  And again, God's new world order was the United States of America, a country without a king.
[02:01:12.820 --> 02:01:16.163]  Yeah, and the Luciferians always hijack and create counterfeits.
[02:01:16.183 --> 02:01:17.944]  That's what the devil's called, is the counterfeiter.
[02:01:18.225 --> 02:01:18.625]  Exactly.
[02:01:18.665 --> 02:01:19.886]  And then let me add this caveat.
[02:01:21.047 --> 02:01:23.892]  I don't know about those advanced technologies 100 years ago.
[02:01:23.932 --> 02:01:25.074]  I know a lot was suppressed.
[02:01:25.094 --> 02:01:26.496]  I know he was raided by the FBI.
[02:01:27.097 --> 02:01:29.982]  I know all of that happened in the 30s, but...
[02:01:31.267 --> 02:01:34.210]  I know they're suppressing clean energy today.
[02:01:34.230 --> 02:01:44.538]  I know that the very people pushing the Malthusian, Darwinistic, kill-everybody view are the very ones involved in the most egregious destruction of the earth.
[02:01:44.578 --> 02:01:54.066]  And so how dare their followers that picked up their whole false religion and their whole nomenclature of this Pionkism tell us they're doing this to save the earth.
[02:01:54.725 --> 02:01:55.925]  That's right, Alex.
[02:01:56.026 --> 02:02:06.209]  The great technologies to free mankind from the slave system and be in harmony with God's creation are still prevalent, but they are not allowed to be released to it.
[02:02:06.229 --> 02:02:07.029]  You got 30 seconds.
[02:02:07.049 --> 02:02:08.290]  What do you think about Bianca?
[02:02:08.900 --> 02:02:18.226]  Well, of course, you're exposing another big lie of how these guys, what the real intentions are and how they backtrack once they're caught disclosing that.
[02:02:19.707 --> 02:02:24.230]  But I'd like to also say that we aren't the Caesars in this country, not our government.
[02:02:24.250 --> 02:02:25.591]  And the Americans better wake up.
[02:02:25.651 --> 02:02:28.012]  We're the Caesar, not the government.
[02:02:28.032 --> 02:02:29.893]  So render unto Caesar what is Caesar's.
[02:02:29.953 --> 02:02:34.636]  Give us the Constitution, all of it, not just part of it, so we can be free.
[02:02:35.057 --> 02:02:35.397]  I hear you.
[02:02:35.977 --> 02:02:37.678]  We'll be right back in the next segment.
[02:02:37.718 --> 02:02:39.339]  More of your calls at Tana News.
[02:02:39.439 --> 02:02:39.979]  Stay with us.
[02:02:43.141 --> 02:02:44.702]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:44.842 --> 02:02:47.944]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:48.064 --> 02:02:51.966]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:52.026 --> 02:02:56.269]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State to the Takeover.
[02:02:56.609 --> 02:03:00.391]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:00.451 --> 02:03:02.312]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:02.532 --> 02:03:05.813]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:03:05.853 --> 02:03:10.555]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:10.715 --> 02:03:13.756]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:03:13.936 --> 02:03:16.817]  They are being led into the Sandpoint brig.
[02:03:17.298 --> 02:03:23.400]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:23.940 --> 02:03:24.461]  We're good to go.
[02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:48.364]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:03:48.724 --> 02:03:52.807]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:03:53.107 --> 02:03:53.648]  We listened.
[02:03:53.968 --> 02:03:58.952]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:03:59.212 --> 02:03:59.693]  We listened.
[02:04:00.093 --> 02:04:03.135]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:04:03.556 --> 02:04:04.096]  We listened.
[02:04:04.557 --> 02:04:07.619]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[02:04:07.939 --> 02:04:08.299]  We're good.
[02:04:34.497 --> 02:04:35.418]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[02:04:35.438 --> 02:04:37.001]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[02:05:43.857 --> 02:05:46.099]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:46.619 --> 02:05:49.482]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:49.622 --> 02:05:55.126]  Alright, I will get into the vision that Bianca got last night from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
[02:05:55.146 --> 02:05:57.708]  Dr. Doom says 90% of you need to die.
[02:05:57.728 --> 02:05:58.589]  It needs to start quick.
[02:05:59.189 --> 02:06:00.230]  The Earth's going to survive.
[02:06:01.351 --> 02:06:02.912]  The China's police state's great.
[02:06:02.932 --> 02:06:06.115]  The 10% of us that are allowed to live will have to bury 9 others.
[02:06:06.415 --> 02:06:08.396]  He's ready to go first, according to his students.
[02:06:08.977 --> 02:06:09.297]  They want 100%.
[02:06:11.556 --> 02:06:14.357]  But I'm first going to get into protesters defend carrying Mexican flags.
[02:06:14.937 --> 02:06:22.200]  And then, of course, we'll go to Jeff and Jeff and Rodney and many others that are holding.
[02:06:22.240 --> 02:06:23.380]  Toll-free number to join us today.
[02:06:23.420 --> 02:06:25.121]  Wide open phones throughout the rest of the broadcast.
[02:06:25.141 --> 02:06:27.842]  The next, what, 51 minutes we've got left.
[02:06:27.862 --> 02:06:28.762]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:28.982 --> 02:06:32.643]  But she hasn't been on us for a couple of weeks.
[02:06:33.124 --> 02:06:35.424]  I'm very happy whenever she does join us.
[02:06:35.925 --> 02:06:38.165]  Number one, it's an American company, Made in America.
[02:06:38.185 --> 02:06:39.646]  If you want British burgers, they've got those, too.
[02:06:40.566 --> 02:06:41.546]  Pretty much the same thing.
[02:06:42.187 --> 02:06:43.027]  Commonwealth here.
[02:06:43.907 --> 02:06:46.648]  But the best units they've got are made right here in America.
[02:06:46.748 --> 02:06:48.449]  They're right here in Texas, up in Dallas.
[02:06:49.289 --> 02:06:52.130]  And they ship it out to you UPS ground, or even quicker if you'd like.
[02:06:52.830 --> 02:06:58.452]  And the water is so full of poison, it is really time to get involved and to...
[02:07:00.080 --> 02:07:02.722]  Stop poisoning yourself, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:02.762 --> 02:07:04.864]  And they've got a lot of new items, a lot of new specials.
[02:07:05.284 --> 02:07:07.066]  And it's always great to have her.
[02:07:07.146 --> 02:07:14.312]  Debbie Morrow, who works for New Millennium Concepts, the national maker of the black Berkey elements and the new Berkey light.
[02:07:14.872 --> 02:07:18.455]  And again, the national distributor of the British Berkeys, if you prefer those.
[02:07:18.475 --> 02:07:22.498]  And they even have stainless steel units with the new, even more powerful black elements.
[02:07:23.259 --> 02:07:25.300]  And it is good to have you on with us, Debbie.
[02:07:25.881 --> 02:07:26.581]  Hi there, Alex.
[02:07:26.722 --> 02:07:28.763]  Thank you very much for having me.
[02:07:28.783 --> 02:07:29.624]  We've had some
[02:07:30.427 --> 02:07:48.511]  Really great conversations between you and I and with your customers about how important it is to take control of your life by putting in your body water that's not contaminated with poison and things that, you know, are going to be harmful to you.
[02:07:48.551 --> 02:07:55.332]  And I've had a lot of customers really glad to hear that the PF2 fluoride filters are a secondary filter
[02:07:56.184 --> 02:08:00.286]  And they've been calling in to order quite a few of those for the people who didn't know.
[02:08:00.346 --> 02:08:04.908]  For those that don't know, fluoride is one of the smallest particles out there, especially stannous fluoride.
[02:08:05.549 --> 02:08:08.570]  And even reverse osmosis doesn't cut it all out.
[02:08:08.590 --> 02:08:12.792]  But you guys have filters that cut 99 plus percent.
[02:08:13.172 --> 02:08:13.693]  That's right.
[02:08:13.793 --> 02:08:15.013]  There's really no known filter.
[02:08:15.053 --> 02:08:16.054]  That's why it's such a perfect...
[02:08:17.035 --> 02:08:21.098]  The pH in the chlorine in the Austin water many times is higher than a swimming pool.
[02:08:43.661 --> 02:08:44.422]  That's correct.
[02:08:44.983 --> 02:08:52.411]  I've heard that here in the Dallas-Fort Worth area also, that you actually have to do something to make it so that you take out
[02:08:53.416 --> 02:08:56.458]  Some of the chlorine with your pool water and things like that.
[02:08:56.638 --> 02:09:03.982]  Well, these malfusians are killing us through the air, the water, the genetically modified food, which admittedly is deadly to the population, causing all sorts of problems.
[02:09:04.262 --> 02:09:05.323]  Cancer is exploding.
[02:09:05.343 --> 02:09:12.927]  I heard some propaganda piece about how for the first time in 50 years, people are surviving cancer more with treatments.
[02:09:12.987 --> 02:09:17.590]  But the cancer numbers are going up at least 500% every 10 years.
[02:09:18.390 --> 02:09:21.312]  Now, we've had a several thousand percent increase.
[02:09:21.352 --> 02:09:22.553]  I can look it up here on the web.
[02:09:23.153 --> 02:09:25.034]  I don't place a number, but I'm sure you've all heard about it.
[02:09:25.655 --> 02:09:29.557]  Diabetes, juvenile diabetes, and so much of it is what's in the water.
[02:09:29.597 --> 02:09:34.280]  Debbie, as you know, the body is 70% water in men, 73% in women.
[02:09:34.920 --> 02:09:35.560]  That's right.
[02:09:35.780 --> 02:09:37.541]  And I don't know.
[02:09:37.862 --> 02:09:44.285]  Personally, for me, my experience is that since I've been drinking Berkey water, I don't get strep throat anymore.
[02:09:44.325 --> 02:09:45.506]  I don't get pneumonia anymore.
[02:09:45.546 --> 02:09:49.288]  My husband's always saying, you know, you don't get sick like you used to get.
[02:09:49.308 --> 02:09:50.929]  And I said, that's right, you know, because we're not.
[02:09:51.405 --> 02:10:00.613]  Poisoning ourselves, and I used to get sick an awful lot, and I don't anymore, so I really believe that the Berkey water really does make a difference.
[02:10:01.313 --> 02:10:06.878]  It's like when you're cooking a pot of spaghetti, are you going to take a little spoonful of arsenic and throw it in your spaghetti sauce?
[02:10:07.378 --> 02:10:15.404]  Same thing when you're drinking water that's not purified first because you're getting just that little bit of poison.
[02:10:15.725 --> 02:10:18.147]  Let me break this down for people.
[02:10:19.216 --> 02:10:19.817]  Take Austin.
[02:10:19.857 --> 02:10:21.578]  Better water than, say, Dallas or Houston.
[02:10:21.618 --> 02:10:25.241]  I mean, Houston, if you drink the water in Houston, even in iced tea, you're insane, folks.
[02:10:25.321 --> 02:10:29.264]  All those hundreds of chemical plants, the cancer level there is one of the highest in the countries.
[02:10:29.604 --> 02:10:35.188]  They have huge, you know, super fun sites all over Houston and surrounding areas.
[02:10:35.208 --> 02:10:35.849]  Corpus Christi.
[02:10:37.041 --> 02:10:38.142]  I have family down there.
[02:10:38.162 --> 02:10:39.703]  When I was a kid, we all laughed at the water.
[02:10:39.783 --> 02:10:41.764]  It stunk so bad, nobody could drink it.
[02:10:42.404 --> 02:10:46.727]  But even if it doesn't stink that bad, they've done tests on Austin water, just like they've done in Dallas.
[02:10:47.047 --> 02:10:57.173]  Prozac, Ritalin, herbicide, pesticide, it all runs from hundreds and hundreds of communities into Lake Travis, where they get some of the water, and it goes to the dam.
[02:10:57.253 --> 02:10:58.514]  It also goes into the aquifer.
[02:10:58.794 --> 02:11:00.855]  They test the aquifer, especially when it gets low.
[02:11:01.255 --> 02:11:02.356]  It's full of everything.
[02:11:02.376 --> 02:11:04.037]  I mean, folks, do you have any idea...
[02:11:04.677 --> 02:11:05.238]  We're good to go.
[02:11:05.298 --> 02:11:05.538]  I think?
[02:11:29.305 --> 02:11:31.347]  Debbie, tell us about some of the new specials.
[02:11:31.727 --> 02:11:34.509]  Well, we're real excited again about the Travel Berkey.
[02:11:34.590 --> 02:11:41.155]  I cannot tell people that we are so happy we finally have a stainless steel unit that we can sell in California.
[02:11:41.175 --> 02:11:46.859]  So for you California listeners, if you've been waiting to get a stainless steel unit, now it's available.
[02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:50.362]  It's our one-and-a-half-gallon Travel Berkey.
[02:11:50.863 --> 02:11:53.865]  It has two Black Berkey purification elements in it.
[02:11:54.358 --> 02:11:59.144]  It is big enough to hold the PF2 fluoride filters also if you need that.
[02:11:59.845 --> 02:12:00.206]  And it's $1.99.
[02:12:01.387 --> 02:12:05.693]  With it, you get either a free Berkey base or you get a free Berkey Sport bottle.
[02:12:06.437 --> 02:12:07.138]  So give me a call.
[02:12:07.538 --> 02:12:10.040]  Let's be clear about the sport bottles in closing.
[02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:21.970]  They do 630 refills of tap water, 130 refills of swamp water, and they only make it safe to drink and reduce the chemicals and poisons and cut out all the bacteria.
[02:12:22.810 --> 02:12:24.432]  So it's great when you're at the gym.
[02:12:24.472 --> 02:12:25.452]  It's great when you're at work.
[02:12:25.973 --> 02:12:27.634]  It's great to make it a lot safer.
[02:12:27.654 --> 02:12:34.220]  It doesn't cut out everything like the actual big units, which take only a couple minutes to put together and are gravity-fed and excellent.
[02:12:34.260 --> 02:12:34.940]  Give her a call, 888-
[02:12:36.041 --> 02:12:46.067]  803-4438, 888-803-4438, or BerkeyWater.com, or go to InfoWars.com and order off the SafeSecure online shopping cart.
[02:12:46.107 --> 02:12:47.367]  Debbie, talk to you in the near future.
[02:12:47.387 --> 02:12:47.968]  Thank you.
[02:12:47.988 --> 02:12:48.428]  Bye-bye, Alex.
[02:12:48.488 --> 02:12:48.768]  You bet.
[02:12:48.788 --> 02:12:49.268]  God bless.
[02:12:49.769 --> 02:12:52.170]  And if you call and it's busy, leave your name and number, she'll call you right back.
[02:12:52.190 --> 02:12:55.572]  She just works for the company just to take calls just from the radio shows.
[02:12:56.232 --> 02:12:56.812]  What did they say?
[02:12:57.173 --> 02:13:05.817]  Something like 85% of their business or more is distributing to the health food stores and the camping supply places and the Oshmans and all those places.
[02:13:06.497 --> 02:13:09.559]  They have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people they supply.
[02:13:09.999 --> 02:13:14.141]  A small part of their business is radio, and this radio show is the biggest part of that.
[02:13:14.721 --> 02:13:17.562]  You get real service with Debbie there, just helping you.
[02:13:17.582 --> 02:13:18.503]  888-803-4438.
[02:13:19.884 --> 02:13:22.425]  We spent five minutes on that, but it's so important.
[02:13:23.265 --> 02:13:23.505]  Okay.
[02:13:25.552 --> 02:13:25.952]  You know what?
[02:13:25.992 --> 02:13:27.514]  This segment's already kind of gotten broken up.
[02:13:27.554 --> 02:13:36.260]  Let's just take a few calls, then I'll start the next segment, get into the Mexican flags and the new developments there, and then the professor, and then an audio clip from JFK and one more.
[02:13:36.581 --> 02:13:37.401]  Let's go to Rodney.
[02:13:37.682 --> 02:13:38.923]  Let's go to Rodney in Texas.
[02:13:39.043 --> 02:13:40.564]  Rodney, you're on the air.
[02:13:40.604 --> 02:13:41.024]  Go ahead.
[02:13:41.705 --> 02:13:43.886]  Hey, thank you, Alex, for taking my call.
[02:13:43.927 --> 02:13:44.427]  Long time.
[02:13:44.507 --> 02:13:50.792]  I'm sorry I listen to the program daily, but I haven't been able to get through to talk with you.
[02:13:50.812 --> 02:13:54.575]  But here's two things I've seen off the Associated Press.
[02:13:55.267 --> 02:13:56.810]  I want to get your thoughts on today.
[02:13:56.850 --> 02:14:05.085]  I was looking at the Associated Press out of Missouri, and they just caught another Chinese spy stealing high-tech secrets.
[02:14:06.749 --> 02:14:08.870]  From our military.
[02:14:08.890 --> 02:14:13.213]  5,000 admitted PLA Chinese front companies buying technology.
[02:14:13.753 --> 02:14:18.836]  And then AIPAC now admits they basically run the Christian Coalition, the Israeli lobby.
[02:14:19.296 --> 02:14:27.701]  They openly run 80 plus percent, what is it, 85 percent of all the phone billing and phone DNS via the computers and White House security.
[02:14:28.182 --> 02:14:34.786]  Foreign Dutch and British and German companies buying up the majority of our water supply companies, our power companies.
[02:14:35.386 --> 02:14:37.007]  The Arabs buying up the ports.
[02:14:37.167 --> 02:14:40.049]  I mean, it's just a total sellout.
[02:14:40.290 --> 02:14:58.202]  And according to that report, they said that the prosecutor sealed most of the conviction because evidently it must have been pretty devastating what this Chinese spy had stolen.
[02:14:58.762 --> 02:15:02.365]  But nevertheless, the second story I want to get your thought on was
[02:15:03.120 --> 02:15:20.025]  The Associated Press out of Texas, DPS, they have now suspended these techniques that they were using to train their DPS officers into doing people because they had an officer get his head beat in.
[02:15:20.865 --> 02:15:26.506]  And evidently, several other officers had gotten their heads beat in, but they didn't die as a result.
[02:15:26.546 --> 02:15:35.248]  And so they claimed they suspended this technique so that they could find some more effective methods of subduing people.
[02:15:35.308 --> 02:15:36.908]  And I wanted to get your thoughts on that.
[02:15:38.008 --> 02:15:39.008]  Well, it's simple.
[02:15:39.989 --> 02:15:41.429]  Some people are going to fight back.
[02:15:41.489 --> 02:15:42.709]  Some people aren't cowards.
[02:15:42.769 --> 02:15:47.750]  And so many times I've seen squad car video where the cop just thinks he's going to beat somebody up
[02:15:48.368 --> 02:15:52.397]  And that person goes, you know what, I've never laid down in my life so far, I'm not going to lay down now.
[02:15:53.058 --> 02:15:56.606]  And these big muscular cops could have a knock-down drag out, sometimes a little guy.
[02:15:57.515 --> 02:16:03.057]  And, you know, I mean, it's hard to stand there and let a jail guard slam your head into a wall and not fight back.
[02:16:03.257 --> 02:16:09.419]  Yeah, well, you know, recently they caught two police officers with a guy who was handcuffed.
[02:16:09.499 --> 02:16:10.639]  No, I know, beating his head in.
[02:16:10.779 --> 02:16:12.080]  They're probably going to go to jail.
[02:16:12.400 --> 02:16:19.962]  So I just, I think that this is a nationwide problem, and I just found it very interesting.
[02:16:22.269 --> 02:16:24.771]  Well, let me just say this.
[02:16:24.811 --> 02:16:32.799]  I saw the Austin Cop video, the really big one, and he's got arms the size of Arnold Schwarzenegger when Schwarzenegger was 30 years old.
[02:16:33.220 --> 02:16:34.922]  And I know the look.
[02:16:34.962 --> 02:16:40.487]  When you see an arm that looks fatty and swollen, I mean, if somebody's got real muscle...
[02:16:41.698 --> 02:16:43.340]  Well, just look at the video.
[02:16:43.960 --> 02:16:45.802]  I mean, he's got the camel hump and everything.
[02:16:45.822 --> 02:16:47.985]  I mean, he's got the look on his face.
[02:16:48.025 --> 02:16:49.466]  He's got the puffiness on the face.
[02:16:49.906 --> 02:16:56.393]  And he's in a crazed... Or he just may have been endowed with the organ that produces testosterone.
[02:16:56.433 --> 02:16:57.795]  Some people naturally have higher levels.
[02:16:57.835 --> 02:17:02.539]  But he definitely is flush with high levels of anabolics.
[02:17:02.679 --> 02:17:04.962]  Whether it's natural or unnatural, it's high levels.
[02:17:05.502 --> 02:17:07.985]  Well, Schwarzenegger admitted he used steroids.
[02:17:08.106 --> 02:17:13.352]  No, I know, but I mean, when I go to the gym, I see these guys strutting around, you know, bulging their eyes out.
[02:17:13.372 --> 02:17:14.513]  Oh, yeah, I know the type.
[02:17:14.733 --> 02:17:15.835]  Of course, most of the time they get...
[02:17:16.636 --> 02:17:23.959]  They get underneath the bench press, and some little guy's bench pressing 330 pounds, and these huge guys are having trouble with 275.
[02:17:25.160 --> 02:17:26.600]  Long term, it doesn't make you very strong.
[02:17:26.640 --> 02:17:27.240]  It screws you up.
[02:17:27.641 --> 02:17:27.921]  All right.
[02:17:27.961 --> 02:17:28.561]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:17:28.841 --> 02:17:29.041]  You bet.
[02:17:29.061 --> 02:17:29.641]  I appreciate the call.
[02:17:29.661 --> 02:17:34.383]  The only way steroids work is if you're already really strong, training really hard, and you use very small amounts.
[02:17:34.484 --> 02:17:35.804]  That's what the power lifters do.
[02:17:36.164 --> 02:17:40.246]  These guys juicing big time, triple stacking, a bunch of wimps.
[02:17:43.559 --> 02:17:44.240]  Hello, folks.

[02:18:44.836 --> 02:18:45.877]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:46.277 --> 02:18:51.781]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:18:52.341 --> 02:18:52.841]  That's right.
[02:18:53.161 --> 02:18:55.443]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:18:55.763 --> 02:19:02.928]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:19:03.488 --> 02:19:11.197]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:19:11.617 --> 02:19:16.423]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:19:17.100 --> 02:19:22.122]  If you'd like to take a look at gold free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:22.903 --> 02:19:27.044]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:19:27.424 --> 02:19:27.665]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:27.705 --> 02:19:29.625]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:19:29.685 --> 02:19:29.986]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:30.286 --> 02:19:30.566]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:42.774 --> 02:19:45.195]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:45.715 --> 02:19:52.017]  Did you know that in 1975, 32 senators and 92 representatives signed the Declaration of Interdependence?
[02:19:52.737 --> 02:19:55.338]  Which stated that we must bring about a new world order?
[02:19:55.898 --> 02:20:00.079]  It called for the surrender of our national sovereignty to international organizations.
[02:20:00.099 --> 02:20:05.481]  It called for the redistribution of the wealth from America to third and fourth world countries.
[02:20:06.282 --> 02:20:14.961]  This is the same New World Order call for by former President George Herbert Walter Bush 210 times at the start of the Iraqi War in 1990-1991.
[02:20:17.501 --> 02:20:25.265]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:25.506 --> 02:20:27.327]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:27.347 --> 02:20:27.667]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:27.687 --> 02:20:28.207]  Call now.
[02:20:28.227 --> 02:20:30.849]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[02:20:43.336 --> 02:20:44.156]  Come on, Bill.
[02:20:44.377 --> 02:20:46.218]  Two weeks ago, you were riding a bicycle.
[02:20:46.398 --> 02:20:49.561]  And today, you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[02:20:49.881 --> 02:20:50.461]  What did you do?
[02:20:50.561 --> 02:20:51.362]  Rob Bill Gates?
[02:20:51.482 --> 02:20:52.203]  No, John.
[02:20:52.283 --> 02:20:53.464]  I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[02:20:53.744 --> 02:20:59.248]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:20:59.548 --> 02:21:05.813]  That's where I learned how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[02:21:06.134 --> 02:21:08.355]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[02:21:08.656 --> 02:21:09.256]  And get this.
[02:21:09.456 --> 02:21:11.518]  They guarantee my success in writing.
[02:21:12.018 --> 02:21:15.461]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week.
[02:21:15.701 --> 02:21:16.121]  Whoa.
[02:21:16.502 --> 02:21:17.702]  What was that website again?
[02:21:17.783 --> 02:21:21.265]  It's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[02:21:21.565 --> 02:21:22.686]  Now write this down, John.
[02:21:22.806 --> 02:21:27.109]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[02:21:27.270 --> 02:21:27.850]  Thanks, Bill.
[02:21:28.130 --> 02:21:29.311]  I'm going there right now.
[02:21:29.731 --> 02:21:30.372]  Check, please.
[02:21:32.152 --> 02:21:33.614]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[02:21:34.094 --> 02:21:34.675]  Sure, John.
[02:21:34.915 --> 02:21:39.260]  Don't forget, it's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[02:21:39.580 --> 02:21:41.282]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[02:21:41.442 --> 02:21:41.783]  Deal.
[02:21:43.644 --> 02:21:48.770]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:21:49.471 --> 02:21:51.773]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:22:02.578 --> 02:22:06.200]  It's one thing when the police beat you up, because they enjoy it, some of them.
[02:22:07.540 --> 02:22:09.862]  And see, in the past there were always bad cops, they get punished.
[02:22:10.862 --> 02:22:15.264]  But now the word's out, they can do whatever they want, so you get even bigger problems until somebody catches it on video.
[02:22:15.964 --> 02:22:18.285]  And then they get cops up on stand to defend it.
[02:22:18.566 --> 02:22:23.868]  Always in handcuffs, we're pounding him and pounding him and pounding him and pounding him and pounding him and pounding him.
[02:22:24.228 --> 02:22:27.790]  I guess because the wife griped at him at home that day, so they just got to beat somebody up.
[02:22:28.504 --> 02:22:29.804]  And I've run into these roid heads.
[02:22:29.824 --> 02:22:33.585]  I mean, I've been trying to go in a restaurant slash bar before and just had one at the door for no reason.
[02:22:33.605 --> 02:22:34.305]  You looking at something?
[02:22:34.545 --> 02:22:35.125]  You want to fight?
[02:22:35.145 --> 02:22:37.186]  And I'm like, look, man, I know you're on a bunch of steroids.
[02:22:37.666 --> 02:22:38.486]  Just back off.
[02:22:38.526 --> 02:22:39.846]  I quit fighting a long time ago.
[02:22:41.307 --> 02:22:47.728]  And, you know, most of these guys that shoot their mouths off and think they like to beat people up, if they ever got in a real fight, they wouldn't know what to do.
[02:22:48.468 --> 02:22:50.569]  And that's what ends up happening to these bullies.
[02:22:50.589 --> 02:22:56.930]  They get in a fight with somebody who knows what they're doing and who knows how to turn it loose, and then they're going to end up in a coma.
[02:22:57.976 --> 02:22:58.757]  And you brought it up.
[02:22:58.777 --> 02:23:00.019]  You got me off on it, Rodney.
[02:23:00.520 --> 02:23:05.186]  It's just, yeah, I don't like bullies, and it's always shameful to watch this kind of stuff happen.
[02:23:05.987 --> 02:23:07.569]  They call it opening up a can.
[02:23:07.589 --> 02:23:08.350]  Isn't that what it's called?
[02:23:08.891 --> 02:23:13.417]  Protestors defend carrying Mexican flags.
[02:23:14.631 --> 02:23:28.660]  Hundreds of protesters gripped Mexican flags as they marched for immigration reform in the past few weeks, but they say a display of cultural unity is being mistaken as a lack of loyalty to the United States.
[02:23:29.861 --> 02:23:31.923]  The displays turned off many Americans.
[02:23:31.963 --> 02:23:38.227]  Conservative talk show hosts admonished the protesters while everyday people wrote angry letters to the editors of their local newspapers.
[02:23:40.971 --> 02:23:44.193]  Hey, Amanda Lee Myers that wrote this piece, you're not going to pacify us.
[02:23:44.213 --> 02:23:44.993]  We're not stupid.
[02:23:45.193 --> 02:23:45.493]  Okay?
[02:23:45.513 --> 02:23:47.654]  And most Hispanics are on our side and aren't stupid either.
[02:23:48.835 --> 02:23:49.195]  Okay?
[02:23:49.315 --> 02:23:52.796]  In many cities in the Southwest, we saw them.
[02:23:53.097 --> 02:23:54.757]  We saw the protest with our own eyes.
[02:23:55.157 --> 02:24:00.020]  Most of us in the Southwest, whether we're black or white or Hispanic, most of us know a little bit of Spanish.
[02:24:00.580 --> 02:24:03.041]  Don't know how to speak it too well, but know what a lot of it means.
[02:24:03.061 --> 02:24:04.222]  Know how to understand a lot of it.
[02:24:05.502 --> 02:24:06.403]  Not very hard to understand.
[02:24:06.443 --> 02:24:07.263]  Pretty simple language.
[02:24:07.805 --> 02:24:10.427]  And we know how to read the signs when we're in English, saying this is our continent.
[02:24:10.487 --> 02:24:10.887]  Leave.
[02:24:11.288 --> 02:24:12.128]  This is Auslan.
[02:24:12.148 --> 02:24:15.931]  And we know about all the big organizations that were actually organizing most of these.
[02:24:15.951 --> 02:24:20.355]  You go to their websites and they show now more than the Southwest.
[02:24:20.375 --> 02:24:25.619]  They say that up into Washington and Kansas, whites are going to have to leave.
[02:24:25.839 --> 02:24:30.723]  And then heads of Hispanic studies and Chicano studies say all whites must die.
[02:24:30.783 --> 02:24:33.045]  And we play tapes of it and people are going to learn.
[02:24:34.105 --> 02:24:40.448]  So just like AP writes articles saying Pianca didn't say 90% need to die and it's good, well, we have his research papers.
[02:24:40.468 --> 02:24:41.428]  We have his own documents.
[02:24:41.769 --> 02:24:42.649]  We have his own books.
[02:24:42.709 --> 02:24:46.911]  We have his own students' blogs worshiping, saying, of course he wants to get rid of 90%.
[02:24:47.711 --> 02:24:49.712]  So just try to keep pacifying us.
[02:24:49.732 --> 02:24:51.393]  Try to keep telling us it's not happening.
[02:24:51.813 --> 02:24:52.874]  That's what scares me, though.
[02:24:52.894 --> 02:24:55.335]  Again, I told you over the weekend I heard a national talk radio show.
[02:24:56.963 --> 02:24:58.884]  I frankly have no idea how it's on the network it's on.
[02:24:58.924 --> 02:25:02.866]  Every time I tune in, it's the Rosicrucians are going to save us, and the open borders are good.
[02:25:02.906 --> 02:25:05.788]  I just don't think people running the network have actually heard the show.
[02:25:06.548 --> 02:25:08.729]  It's not this network, and I'm not even knocking the other network.
[02:25:09.310 --> 02:25:11.791]  I guess this network's got some pretty shameful stuff on it, too.
[02:25:12.151 --> 02:25:13.292]  But I guess that's free speech.
[02:25:13.352 --> 02:25:20.636]  The point is, I'm listening to this, and then I heard the same thing with another person on WOAI, Big Mainstream Station.
[02:25:21.946 --> 02:25:23.868]  That was carrying a national show the next night.
[02:25:23.988 --> 02:25:25.489]  And it's, oh, it's all lies.
[02:25:25.509 --> 02:25:27.891]  There's only Mexican, I mean, only American flags.
[02:25:27.931 --> 02:25:28.891]  We love America.
[02:25:28.911 --> 02:25:33.435]  And then I called into both, and I'm like, it's Aslan.
[02:25:33.455 --> 02:25:37.598]  Your top professors all say, the conservatives say, we're just going to force the whites out.
[02:25:37.898 --> 02:25:39.840]  The liberals say, we're going to kill all of you.
[02:25:40.715 --> 02:25:42.937]  Again, I don't mean the classical conservative-liberal term.
[02:25:42.997 --> 02:25:48.421]  I mean, a conservative doesn't want to kill everybody or get everybody, and a liberal wants to kill everyone.
[02:25:48.441 --> 02:25:50.002]  It's like, Pionk is in the middle of the road.
[02:25:50.022 --> 02:25:50.683]  He only wants to kill 90%.
[02:25:51.103 --> 02:25:56.747]  See, it's this whole mentality of death, death, death, death, death, death is the answer.
[02:25:57.188 --> 02:26:01.131]  So we have people with... I mean, I watch Spanish TV in Austin, folks.
[02:26:01.631 --> 02:26:02.772]  I counted it.
[02:26:02.792 --> 02:26:06.174]  90 Mexican flags or foreign flags to every American flag.
[02:26:07.596 --> 02:26:09.457]  Most of the foreign flags were Mexican flags.
[02:26:10.242 --> 02:26:11.222]  And I live here in Austin.
[02:26:11.703 --> 02:26:15.424]  There's a big Mexican food restaurant with a picture of an Aztec cutting a white person's heart out.
[02:26:15.744 --> 02:26:17.585]  The city put up a big thing on the green belt.
[02:26:17.965 --> 02:26:23.447]  Big huge stone sculpture saying this is Mexico, this is Aslan.
[02:26:23.907 --> 02:26:28.329]  The mayor had a proclamation saying Hispanics are the supreme god race.
[02:26:28.389 --> 02:26:30.450]  I mean, I thought I was at a Ku Klux Klan meeting.
[02:26:30.830 --> 02:26:31.750]  We've got it on video.
[02:26:31.810 --> 02:26:32.911]  I've got to dig that out and play it.
[02:26:32.951 --> 02:26:33.871]  I played it like a year ago.
[02:26:34.331 --> 02:26:35.011]  Gus Garcia.
[02:26:36.112 --> 02:26:36.292]  So...
[02:26:37.168 --> 02:26:38.389]  I'm just here reporting.
[02:26:38.409 --> 02:26:40.851]  You know, when Bianca says we all need to die, I report on it.
[02:26:41.311 --> 02:26:48.836]  When a bunch of the Mexican leaders say whites are evil and need to leave, and then the radicals say we all need to die, I mean, it's pretty radical to say we all got to leave.
[02:26:50.297 --> 02:26:53.179]  It's not like most Hispanics and whites aren't getting along real good.
[02:26:54.020 --> 02:26:55.621]  And haven't always gotten along real good.
[02:26:55.661 --> 02:26:59.083]  I mean, the founder of Texas, the guy that wrote the Constitution, was Hispanic.
[02:27:00.324 --> 02:27:05.227]  The Mexicans, the Tejanos, asked Andrew Jackson to take Texas, and he said no.
[02:27:05.527 --> 02:27:06.188]  The Spanish then...
[02:27:07.737 --> 02:27:12.058]  Had handed it over in a revolution to the Mexicans, and the Mexicans tried to sell it to the U.S.
[02:27:12.398 --> 02:27:14.518]  There were only a few thousand Mexicans in Texas.
[02:27:14.538 --> 02:27:16.439]  They couldn't hold it from the Comanche.
[02:27:17.299 --> 02:27:18.919]  But you can't tell these people that.
[02:27:18.979 --> 02:27:21.440]  I mean, it's just, we're going to kill you.
[02:27:21.500 --> 02:27:22.820]  And you're like, well, please don't kill me.
[02:27:23.300 --> 02:27:24.580]  How dare you say that?
[02:27:25.800 --> 02:27:29.981]  Again, they're speaking another language, so they've kept it secret for a while.
[02:27:30.081 --> 02:27:32.062]  Now they're getting scared that we're learning.
[02:27:32.722 --> 02:27:34.282]  Just like Bianca's getting scared.
[02:27:35.842 --> 02:27:36.763]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.243 --> 02:27:38.864]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.765 --> 02:27:42.546]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:28:58.538 --> 02:29:02.019]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria
[02:29:02.299 --> 02:29:02.739]  We're good to go.
[02:29:28.260 --> 02:29:30.361]  So it can be used as a night light or camp light.

[02:29:42.547 --> 02:29:43.828]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:29:45.316 --> 02:29:45.917]  We're good to go.
[02:30:05.896 --> 02:30:07.498]  So take matters into your own hands.
[02:30:22.376 --> 02:30:22.976]  We're good to go.
[02:30:54.921 --> 02:31:10.973]  Finishing up on the fact that in Phoenix, Mexicans at the high school took down the American flag, hoisted a Mexican flag, and the local ROTC cadets got together, took down the Mexican flag, and burned it.
[02:31:10.993 --> 02:31:11.994]  And they should have done a lot more.
[02:31:13.535 --> 02:31:15.437]  In fact, this becomes a big issue.
[02:31:15.477 --> 02:31:16.818]  I'm going to go down to the Capitol.
[02:31:16.838 --> 02:31:18.319]  I'm going to burn a whole bunch of Mexican flags.
[02:31:18.339 --> 02:31:19.480]  I've already burned UN flags.
[02:31:19.760 --> 02:31:20.621]  I'm not putting up with it.
[02:31:21.226 --> 02:31:22.607]  The Mexican flag is evil, folks.
[02:31:22.627 --> 02:31:25.228]  You know what the symbolism that they've admit is?
[02:31:26.049 --> 02:31:32.693]  That is, the old flag had an eagle with a human heart, and it's a sacrifice.
[02:31:32.713 --> 02:31:36.075]  The cactus was a man having his heart torn out.
[02:31:36.115 --> 02:31:37.215]  It's an Aztec symbol.
[02:31:38.216 --> 02:31:39.177]  It's an Aztec legend.
[02:31:40.017 --> 02:31:42.519]  And Mexico has suppressed its people, done horrible things.
[02:31:42.919 --> 02:31:47.001]  The empire was bad under Spain, and then it's had nothing but thugs in ever since.
[02:31:47.061 --> 02:31:48.142]  They need freedom down there.
[02:31:49.129 --> 02:31:51.770]  They had a revolution down there, and they got a new flag, and they were free.
[02:31:52.070 --> 02:31:54.071]  We'd be allies, and I want to be friends.
[02:31:54.891 --> 02:32:01.273]  But I've got all these pictures off of the La Ricanquista and Mexico movement, where it says, Mexican, not Latino, not Hispanic.
[02:32:01.693 --> 02:32:03.034]  Mexican, not American.
[02:32:03.714 --> 02:32:05.915]  This is our land.
[02:32:05.935 --> 02:32:06.855]  This is our continent.
[02:32:06.935 --> 02:32:08.016]  We didn't cross the borders.
[02:32:08.056 --> 02:32:09.316]  The borders crossed us.
[02:32:09.356 --> 02:32:10.256]  Go home, pilgrim.
[02:32:10.537 --> 02:32:11.737]  Plan of the Aslan.
[02:32:11.997 --> 02:32:13.458]  Pictures of the Southwest cut off.
[02:32:13.498 --> 02:32:14.638]  That's the majority.
[02:32:16.147 --> 02:32:21.629]  Why did I go out to the... See, I always used to before other people do, and I'm not saying I'm special.
[02:32:21.649 --> 02:32:22.830]  I don't like having to do it.
[02:32:24.190 --> 02:32:29.892]  I learned from their own publications last year, Mexican Independence Day was going to be basically a call for taking over America.
[02:32:29.912 --> 02:32:34.814]  And I called up several of the main groups organizing thousands of these folks to march.
[02:32:35.689 --> 02:32:38.330]  And I said, most Hispanics don't know what your group is, do they?
[02:32:38.790 --> 02:32:40.371]  No, but they're going to learn, Mr. Jones.
[02:32:40.811 --> 02:32:42.051]  I said, so did you say this?
[02:32:42.071 --> 02:32:43.972]  Did you say that all the gringos need to leave?
[02:32:44.032 --> 02:32:44.312]  Yes.
[02:32:45.632 --> 02:32:45.832]  Why?
[02:32:45.872 --> 02:32:47.073]  What's wrong, gringo?
[02:32:47.593 --> 02:32:49.073]  You know, that's racist what you're saying to me.
[02:32:49.113 --> 02:32:50.694]  I don't call you names.
[02:32:51.234 --> 02:32:53.435]  And he goes, I bet you do behind closed doors.
[02:32:53.455 --> 02:32:54.835]  And I go, no, I actually don't.
[02:32:55.715 --> 02:32:56.896]  A lot of my friends are Hispanic.
[02:32:56.996 --> 02:32:58.816]  Oh, that's what you all say, gringo.
[02:32:58.836 --> 02:33:01.377]  This is like prestigious known people here in town.
[02:33:01.857 --> 02:33:03.978]  And I'm just like, oh, I wish I had a recorder on this phone.
[02:33:04.804 --> 02:33:07.586]  And he's just like, and I'll go, well, you know, I think we're going to come out there and protest you.
[02:33:07.886 --> 02:33:09.147]  You wouldn't dare.
[02:33:09.468 --> 02:33:10.889]  Don't you even try it.
[02:33:12.034 --> 02:33:14.335]  And I know a lot of these folks call it threatening the Minutemen and others.
[02:33:14.635 --> 02:33:14.996]  That's it.
[02:33:15.036 --> 02:33:16.697]  You threaten me, I stand up against you.
[02:33:17.197 --> 02:33:23.700]  So I went down there, and we bullhorned, and we had a lot of Hispanics coming over who were wearing red, white, blue, going, yeah, we're not with those groups.
[02:33:23.740 --> 02:33:26.642]  We just heard this was kind of a thing for Mexican pride.
[02:33:27.042 --> 02:33:32.245]  Look, I don't care if Italians march, Mexicans march, Germans march, and say, oh, you know, we love our culture.
[02:33:32.445 --> 02:33:33.906]  But that isn't what this is.
[02:33:34.646 --> 02:33:36.227]  This is we're taking over.
[02:33:36.828 --> 02:33:38.849]  We operate along racial lines.
[02:33:43.137 --> 02:33:47.220]  And I'm not going to put up with it, and Hispanics aren't going to put up with it, and my Hispanic friends aren't going to put up with it.
[02:33:47.781 --> 02:33:50.322]  And they've commended me for what I'm doing, and they understand what I'm doing.
[02:33:50.362 --> 02:33:51.583]  They say it makes them feel bad.
[02:33:51.964 --> 02:33:52.924]  It embarrasses them.
[02:33:52.964 --> 02:33:54.766]  They've never had racial tensions.
[02:33:55.406 --> 02:33:57.728]  My friends, many of them have said this, and now they're feeling it.
[02:33:57.948 --> 02:34:01.771]  Yeah, whites are starting to look at Mexicans and not like them, and that's wrong.
[02:34:01.831 --> 02:34:03.352]  That's what the government wants.
[02:34:03.793 --> 02:34:10.778]  They want us all suspicious of each other, and then the Mexicans hear that we don't like them, and then it just starts the ball rolling, and then more of them join in.
[02:34:11.218 --> 02:34:13.559]  People like Jose Gutierrez who says, kill all the whites.
[02:34:13.599 --> 02:34:14.980]  We must kill the gringos, the quote.
[02:34:16.901 --> 02:34:18.622]  I mean, he writes papers saying this.
[02:34:18.642 --> 02:34:19.943]  The head of Chicano Studies.
[02:34:20.603 --> 02:34:21.143]  UT!
[02:34:24.585 --> 02:34:27.247]  You know, we protest the Nazis here.
[02:34:27.287 --> 02:34:28.207]  We protest it all.
[02:34:28.247 --> 02:34:32.009]  So don't give me your baloney about, oh, you just don't like Mexicans.
[02:34:32.069 --> 02:34:32.730]  I'm sick of it.
[02:34:33.070 --> 02:34:38.773]  And yeah, we got 30 million illegals here, 20-something million being Mexicans, and I don't want 30 million more.
[02:34:38.793 --> 02:34:40.354]  Our economy's falling apart!
[02:34:41.246 --> 02:34:43.507]  And don't say that you guys do jobs nobody wants.
[02:34:43.527 --> 02:34:45.868]  Yeah, you drive the wages down so low, nobody can do it.
[02:34:46.108 --> 02:34:50.850]  Unless they're living ten to a house like you do, sending the money back home, where you guys have got big rancheros.
[02:34:53.831 --> 02:34:58.232]  I mean, these people are entrepreneurs, but they're being used by the globalists.
[02:35:00.773 --> 02:35:04.235]  By the way, I'll just spend a few minutes on this, then we'll take a few calls after I play this clip.
[02:35:05.215 --> 02:35:10.517]  Associated Press picked up on it, some of the states yesterday, and I'm told by the University of the FBI did visit
[02:35:11.670 --> 02:35:15.032]  Last night, professors, population speeches, unnerved some.
[02:35:15.292 --> 02:35:18.974]  And it says, he just says he's issuing a warning, but others see talk of pandemics as threat.
[02:35:18.994 --> 02:35:21.476]  No, he said it's coming, he wants it, it's good.
[02:35:21.536 --> 02:35:21.996]  That's why.
[02:35:22.336 --> 02:35:31.102]  So they write this big whitewash, but it says, Bianca, who calls the letter, the latter interpretation nonsense, says the whole thing is blown out of proportion.
[02:35:31.442 --> 02:35:37.926]  Many, however, seem to be talking and taking his critics seriously.
[02:35:38.740 --> 02:35:39.461]  Suddenly I can't read.
[02:35:39.501 --> 02:35:39.981]  Let me start over.
[02:35:40.281 --> 02:35:42.403]  I try to hurry up, and then I just screw up everything.
[02:35:42.423 --> 02:35:43.203]  He said,
[02:36:00.214 --> 02:36:10.483]  There's no denying that Bianca, even at first glance, seems a little eccentric.
[02:36:11.323 --> 02:36:21.552]  Does the media counter what he said, what he admits, what are in his own graduate papers, what are in his own thesis that he wrote decades ago, what's in books he's published, what he gives out as course studies?
[02:36:21.612 --> 02:36:22.513]  It's all there!
[02:36:24.033 --> 02:36:25.413]  It's all there.
[02:36:25.894 --> 02:36:34.116]  And then you go read his students who are now working in the biology department as instructors and as professors, defending him, going, yes, he's not radical.
[02:36:34.176 --> 02:36:35.317]  We all need to die.
[02:36:38.858 --> 02:36:49.221]  And then they send me an email and go, go ahead and publish this, you know, dummy, and call us names, and I publish it, and then they freak out, take it down, I'm getting calls, I'm endangering my life.
[02:36:49.621 --> 02:36:52.362]  Well, please, no one threaten these people, but what do you expect?
[02:36:54.788 --> 02:36:56.489]  Dr. Bianca's not for violence.
[02:36:56.790 --> 02:36:57.550]  He loves life.
[02:36:57.570 --> 02:36:59.512]  He just believes this has got to happen.
[02:36:59.532 --> 02:37:01.333]  He says he knows he needs to go first.
[02:37:01.813 --> 02:37:05.776]  Once it starts, and his family too, he's sad, but it's better that way.
[02:37:05.796 --> 02:37:07.658]  I mean, these are the things I'm reading here.
[02:37:10.347 --> 02:37:14.150]  The FBI, though, needs to go read Dick Cheney's own documents he's written, or Henry Kissinger.
[02:37:14.170 --> 02:37:16.231]  If they want to go investigate him, I say bravo!
[02:37:16.791 --> 02:37:24.637]  I mean, a lot of local FBI guys in the country are just real crime fighters out dealing with Rob Banks and nuts and fruits, and these FBI guys know cults when they hear them.
[02:37:24.917 --> 02:37:30.841]  His followers calling him God and a genius and a great leader and Pianca for president and Piancians.
[02:37:32.671 --> 02:37:34.352]  I mean, they know what these guys are into.
[02:37:34.372 --> 02:37:35.633]  They know it's Hale-Bopp.
[02:37:36.254 --> 02:37:37.755]  It's Jonestown.
[02:37:37.815 --> 02:37:39.656]  It's the classic M.O.
[02:37:39.757 --> 02:37:41.878]  And then you look at him on NBC.
[02:37:41.998 --> 02:37:44.420]  I mean, he looks like just a classical caricature.
[02:37:44.660 --> 02:37:50.144]  He looks like somebody you see who has escaped from the state hospital, the mental institution.
[02:37:51.365 --> 02:37:54.488]  All right, I've been wanting to play this for years, and I never have.
[02:37:54.628 --> 02:38:02.174]  And this is the summation by Jim Garrison, played by one of my favorite actors from the movie JFK.
[02:38:03.576 --> 02:38:11.662]  And we'll go ahead and roll this, because I think it says it all, not just about JFK, but about our lives in general and standing up for what's right.
[02:38:12.082 --> 02:38:14.624]  So here's Kevin Costner as Jim Garrison in the trial.
[02:38:15.384 --> 02:38:19.967]  And so many decades ago, he's playing the part of Jim Garrison.
[02:38:19.987 --> 02:38:20.748]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:38:21.428 --> 02:38:24.711]  He's speaking to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury in his summation.
[02:38:24.731 --> 02:38:25.031]  Here it is.
[02:38:25.971 --> 02:38:30.855]  Hitler always said, the bigger the lie, the more people will believe it.
[02:38:32.722 --> 02:38:40.385]  Lee Harvey Oswald, a crazed, lonely man who wanted attention and got it by killing the president, was only the first in a long line of papsies.
[02:38:41.566 --> 02:38:50.270]  In later years, Bobby Kennedy, Martin Luther King, men whose commitment to change and peace would make them dangerous to men who are committed to war, would follow.
[02:38:51.530 --> 02:38:53.912]  Also killed by such lonely, crazed men.
[02:38:55.352 --> 02:38:59.214]  Men who remove our guilt by making murder a meaningless act of a loner.
[02:39:00.899 --> 02:39:07.145]  We've all become hamlets in our country, children of a slain father leader, whose killers still possess the throne.
[02:39:08.206 --> 02:39:13.551]  The ghost of John F. Kennedy confronts us with the secret murder at the heart of the American dream.
[02:39:14.432 --> 02:39:18.176]  He forces on us the appalling questions of what has our Constitution made?
[02:39:19.560 --> 02:39:21.901]  What is our citizenship and more our lives worth?
[02:39:21.941 --> 02:39:31.265]  What is the future of a democracy where a president can be assassinated under conspicuously suspicious circumstances while the machinery of legal action scarcely trembles?
[02:39:32.866 --> 02:39:39.129]  How many more political murders to size as heart attacks, suicides, cancers, drug overdoses?
[02:39:39.329 --> 02:39:43.991]  How many airplane and car crashes will occur before they are exposed for what they are?
[02:39:46.392 --> 02:39:48.793]  Treason doth never prosper, wrote an English poet.
[02:39:50.151 --> 02:39:50.671]  What's the reason?
[02:39:52.332 --> 02:39:54.412]  For if it prosper, none dare call it treason.
[02:39:55.752 --> 02:39:57.953]  The American public has yet to see the Zapruder film.
[02:39:59.413 --> 02:39:59.673]  Why?
[02:40:00.994 --> 02:40:05.095]  The American public has yet to see the real x-rays and photographs of the autopsy.
[02:40:05.335 --> 02:40:05.755]  Why?
[02:40:07.235 --> 02:40:10.316]  There are hundreds of documents that could help prove this conspiracy.
[02:40:10.576 --> 02:40:12.917]  Why are they being withheld or burned by the government?
[02:40:14.785 --> 02:40:22.869]  Each time my office or you the people have asked those questions demanded crucial evidence, the answer from on high has always been national security.
[02:40:24.469 --> 02:40:27.871]  What kind of national security do we have when we've been robbed of our leaders?
[02:40:29.211 --> 02:40:37.615]  What national security permits the removal of fundamental power from the hands of the American people and validates the ascendancy of invisible government in the United States?
[02:40:39.622 --> 02:40:44.744]  That kind of national security, gentlemen, enjoys when it smells like it, feels like it, and looks like it.
[02:40:45.744 --> 02:40:46.764]  You call it what it is.
[02:40:48.025 --> 02:40:48.445]  Fascism.
[02:40:51.566 --> 02:40:57.468]  I submit to you that what took place on November 22, 1963, was a coup d'etat.
[02:40:59.028 --> 02:41:04.970]  Its most direct and tragic result was the reversal of President Kennedy's commitment to withdraw from Vietnam.
[02:41:06.798 --> 02:41:11.501]  The war is the biggest business in America, worth $80 billion a year.
[02:41:12.801 --> 02:41:28.210]  President Kennedy was murdered by a conspiracy that was planned in advance at the highest levels of our government, and it was carried out by fanatical and disciplined Cold Warriors in the Pentagon and CIA's covert operation apparatus, among them Clay Shaw here before you.
[02:41:29.511 --> 02:41:45.630]  It was a public execution, and it was covered up by like-minded individuals in the Dallas Police Department, the Secret Service, the FBI, and the White House, all the way up to including J. Edgar Hoover and Lyndon Johnson, whom I consider accomplices after the fact.
[02:41:46.651 --> 02:41:50.295]  The assassination reduced the president to a transient official.
[02:41:51.232 --> 02:42:02.102]  His job, his assignment, is to speak as often as possible of this nation's desire for peace while he acts as a business agent in the Congress for the military and their hardware manufacturers.
[02:42:04.364 --> 02:42:05.986]  Now some people say I'm crazy.
[02:42:08.048 --> 02:42:10.730]  Southern caricatures seeking higher office.
[02:42:13.132 --> 02:42:15.935]  Well there is a simple way to determine if I am paranoid.
[02:42:16.716 --> 02:42:27.961]  Let's ask the two men who propped up the most from the assassination, your former president Lyndon Baines Johnson and your new president, Richard Nixon, to release the 51 CIA documents pertaining to Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby.
[02:42:29.221 --> 02:42:34.903]  Or the secret CIA memo on Oswald's activities in Russia that was destroyed while being photocopied.
[02:42:35.564 --> 02:42:36.984]  All these documents are yours.
[02:42:38.005 --> 02:42:38.925]  The people's property.
[02:42:39.105 --> 02:42:39.865]  You pay for it.
[02:42:41.386 --> 02:42:46.288]  But because the government considers you children who might be too disturbed or distressed to face this reality,
[02:42:47.386 --> 02:42:49.666]  Or because you might possibly lynch those involved?
[02:42:51.107 --> 02:42:53.887]  You cannot see these documents for another 75 years.
[02:42:55.307 --> 02:43:15.331]  I'm in my early 40s, so I'll have shuffled off this mortal coil by then, but I'm already telling my 8-year-old son to keep himself physically fit so that one glorious September morning in the year 2038, he can walk into the National Archives and find out what the CIA and the FBI knew.
[02:43:17.065 --> 02:43:18.526]  They may even push it back then.
[02:43:18.566 --> 02:43:24.191]  Hell, it may become a generational affair with questions passed down father to son, mother to daughter.
[02:43:24.451 --> 02:43:28.374]  But someday, somewhere, someone may find out the damn truth.
[02:43:29.455 --> 02:43:29.955]  We better.
[02:43:31.716 --> 02:43:41.764]  We better or we might just as well build ourselves another government like the Declaration of Independence says to when the old one ain't working, just a little father out west.
[02:43:44.006 --> 02:43:45.247]  American naturalist wrote,
[02:43:46.135 --> 02:43:50.699]  A patriot must always be ready to defend his country against its government.
[02:43:53.241 --> 02:43:54.682]  I'd hate to be in your shoes today.
[02:43:56.083 --> 02:43:57.124]  You've got a lot to think about.
[02:43:57.144 --> 02:44:00.027]  You've seen much hidden evidence the American public has never seen.
[02:44:01.968 --> 02:44:09.795]  You know, going back to when we were children, I think that most of us in this courtroom thought that justice came into being automatically.
[02:44:11.076 --> 02:44:12.657]  That virtue was its own reward.
[02:44:13.018 --> 02:44:14.519]  That good would triumph over evil.
[02:44:16.325 --> 02:44:18.607]  But as we get older, we know this just isn't true.
[02:44:20.228 --> 02:44:22.870]  Individual human beings have to create justice.
[02:44:22.890 --> 02:44:23.871]  And this is not easy.
[02:44:25.712 --> 02:44:28.134]  Because the truth often poses a threat to power.
[02:44:29.335 --> 02:44:32.237]  And one often has to fight power at great risk to themselves.
[02:44:33.058 --> 02:44:33.939]  People like S.M.
[02:44:33.979 --> 02:44:40.404]  Holland, Lee Bowers, Gene Hill, Willie O'Keefe, have all taken that risk.
[02:44:40.424 --> 02:44:41.465]  They've all come forward.
[02:44:43.086 --> 02:44:44.347]  I have here some $8,000 in these letters sent
[02:44:46.599 --> 02:44:48.541]  Sent to my office from all over the country.
[02:44:49.321 --> 02:44:55.186]  Quarters, dimes, dollar bills from housewives, plumbers, car salesmen, teachers, invalids.
[02:44:56.687 --> 02:44:59.350]  These are people who cannot afford to send money for due.
[02:45:01.011 --> 02:45:07.236]  These are the ones who drive the cabs, who nurse in the hospitals, who see their kids go to Vietnam.
[02:45:08.978 --> 02:45:09.298]  Why?
[02:45:11.540 --> 02:45:12.540]  Because they care.
[02:45:13.942 --> 02:45:15.483]  Because they want to know the truth.
[02:45:16.778 --> 02:45:18.219]  Because I want the country back.
[02:45:18.900 --> 02:45:20.381]  Because it still belongs to us.
[02:45:21.502 --> 02:45:24.124]  As long as the people have the guts to fight for what they believe in.
[02:45:27.887 --> 02:45:30.108]  The truth is the most important value we have.
[02:45:30.208 --> 02:45:42.058]  Because if the truth does not endure, if the government murders truth, if we cannot respect the hearts of these people, then this is not the country in which I was born in and it's certainly not the country that I want to die in.
[02:45:42.078 --> 02:45:44.900]  Stinson wrote,
[02:45:45.672 --> 02:45:47.233]  Authority forgets the dying king.
[02:45:49.755 --> 02:45:57.382]  This was never more true than for John F. Kennedy, whose murder was probably one of the most terrible moments in the history of our country.
[02:46:00.965 --> 02:46:10.432]  You, the people, the jury system sitting in judgment on Clay Shaw, represent the hope of humanity against government power.
[02:46:12.334 --> 02:46:13.515]  In discharging your duty,
[02:46:14.912 --> 02:46:24.315]  And bringing the first conviction in this house of cards against Clay Shaw that's not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country.
[02:46:26.055 --> 02:46:29.276]  Do not forget your dying king.
[02:46:31.557 --> 02:46:38.318]  Show this world that this is still a government of the people for the people and by the people.
[02:46:41.079 --> 02:46:44.320]  Nothing as long as you live will ever be more important
[02:46:48.280 --> 02:46:48.880]  It's up to you.
[02:46:50.381 --> 02:46:51.201]  It's up to you.
[02:46:52.741 --> 02:46:53.562]  It's up to you.
[02:46:55.042 --> 02:46:57.903]  The ball is in your court in every way.
[02:46:59.424 --> 02:47:03.525]  And the very criminals, some of the very operatives that were there that day, George Bush Sr.
[02:47:03.565 --> 02:47:06.726]  was there, their progeny carried out 9-11.
[02:47:06.806 --> 02:47:09.527]  And they're going to carry out more.
[02:47:11.798 --> 02:47:14.840]  Henry Kissinger, oh, the exact quote escapes me, but he paraphrased.
[02:47:14.880 --> 02:47:16.401]  Somebody said, we're losing so many soldiers.
[02:47:16.421 --> 02:47:18.503]  He said, ah, that's what young men are for.
[02:47:18.543 --> 02:47:22.065]  And that fake little, that is what young men are for to die.
[02:47:22.946 --> 02:47:24.287]  It's real funny.
[02:47:25.147 --> 02:47:32.152]  And it's all these little soft nothings who just sit up there and play with us like we're chess pieces on a board.
[02:47:33.133 --> 02:47:33.913]  And I'm tired of it.
[02:47:34.474 --> 02:47:39.377]  And what he's saying there is it's the jury's job, the grand jury's job, to block a criminal government.
[02:47:40.279 --> 02:47:42.400]  That's another way we vote, not just at the ballot box.
[02:47:42.420 --> 02:47:44.441]  And now they've tried to usurp that, and they have in many respects.
[02:47:44.741 --> 02:47:49.523]  That's why the Citizen Rulebook we sell at cost, a dollar apiece, or get 10 for $10, get 100 for $75.
[02:47:49.643 --> 02:47:52.744]  There are discounts when you get a bunch of them.
[02:47:53.044 --> 02:47:56.706]  It's got jury rights, Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights, Constitution, a bunch of quotes.
[02:47:56.746 --> 02:47:58.766]  It's 62 pages, a little covered booklet.
[02:47:58.846 --> 02:47:59.247]  It's nice.
[02:47:59.987 --> 02:48:05.909]  Every order of a video or a book or a DVD, book on tape, T-shirt, you get one of these.
[02:48:05.969 --> 02:48:07.590]  On bigger orders, you get two or three.
[02:48:08.931 --> 02:48:10.513]  Or you can just order them and get them out to people.
[02:48:12.234 --> 02:48:17.479]  And it's so important that people understand that we're losing our freedoms and that a very evil group is in control.
[02:48:17.499 --> 02:48:19.421]  It's that simple.
[02:48:20.402 --> 02:48:23.985]  Come back at one or two final news items and take two or three calls in the final segment.
[02:48:24.085 --> 02:48:24.966]  Good broadcast today.
[02:48:24.986 --> 02:48:25.847]  I'm glad you all joined us.
[02:48:26.368 --> 02:48:31.873]  I always want to thank all of our affiliates, our sponsors, the folks running the show, people down here in Austin, my webmasters, my producers, everybody.
[02:48:32.373 --> 02:48:32.834]  Great job.
[02:48:33.514 --> 02:48:33.654]  But...
[02:48:34.918 --> 02:48:37.179]  I got miles to go before I sleep, as they say.
[02:48:37.219 --> 02:48:40.161]  The woods are lovely, dark and deep, but I have miles to go before I sleep.
[02:48:40.521 --> 02:48:41.522]  Final segment coming up.
[02:48:44.563 --> 02:48:47.425]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:47.685 --> 02:48:48.365]  Hello, my friends.
[02:48:48.466 --> 02:48:49.266]  Alex Jones here.
[02:48:49.606 --> 02:48:54.289]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:54.609 --> 02:48:59.051]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:48:59.452 --> 02:49:03.634]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:03.854 --> 02:49:06.697]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:06.797 --> 02:49:11.461]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:11.661 --> 02:49:16.086]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight, piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:16.306 --> 02:49:23.553]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:23.793 --> 02:49:26.215]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:49:26.375 --> 02:49:28.117]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[02:49:28.277 --> 02:49:34.239]  1-888-253-3139 Or visit InfoWars.com and the secure shopping cart.

[02:49:43.641 --> 02:49:49.885]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:49:50.025 --> 02:49:56.188]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:49:56.469 --> 02:50:04.894]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:50:05.134 --> 02:50:12.158]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:50:12.478 --> 02:50:17.281]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:50:17.501 --> 02:50:22.905]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:50:23.245 --> 02:50:26.327]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:50:26.668 --> 02:50:34.573]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:34.673 --> 02:50:35.253]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:50:44.919 --> 02:50:45.539]  We're good to go.
[02:51:00.203 --> 02:51:00.864]  We're good to go.
[02:51:20.401 --> 02:51:21.081]  We're good to go.
[02:51:21.181 --> 02:51:21.461]  I think?
[02:51:45.877 --> 02:51:51.923]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:51:52.523 --> 02:51:55.486]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:52:08.678 --> 02:52:13.920]  Appearing to be tortured, police said, slaying certain to send shockwaves through Northern Ireland's peace process.
[02:52:13.960 --> 02:52:19.422]  Dennis Donaldson was Sinn Fein's former legislative chief in the failed power-sharing government of Northern Ireland.
[02:52:20.122 --> 02:52:23.323]  And of course, he admitted to being on the British payroll all along.
[02:52:23.423 --> 02:52:24.663]  And not just Sinn Fein.
[02:52:24.924 --> 02:52:26.624]  The leaders of the IRA in every case.
[02:52:26.764 --> 02:52:34.627]  The leaders ordering people to carry out bombings in the IRA, not the political arm of Sinn Fein, turned out to be MI6, British Commandos, MI5.
[02:52:36.132 --> 02:52:37.573]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[02:52:37.593 --> 02:52:37.733]  Good.
[02:53:02.253 --> 02:53:06.596]  Hey, I'm Jeff that sent you the footage from the 522 Freemason Lodge.
[02:53:07.176 --> 02:53:09.118]  Yes, it's a report on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:53:09.178 --> 02:53:09.598]  Thank you.
[02:53:10.279 --> 02:53:11.439]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:53:11.459 --> 02:53:13.301]  The stuff you put on there is fantastic.
[02:53:13.481 --> 02:53:17.343]  I wanted to give a message out to some of the New York callers who have called in today.
[02:53:17.363 --> 02:53:18.324]  Quite a few, by the way.
[02:53:18.344 --> 02:53:23.928]  I have a public access television show in the Syracuse Time Warner area.
[02:53:24.508 --> 02:53:26.470]  It's on from 4 to 6 on Thursdays.
[02:53:26.530 --> 02:53:28.111]  It's called Expose and Defeat Tyranny.
[02:53:28.590 --> 02:53:31.612]  And next week, I'm going to be showing a Freemason expose.
[02:53:31.712 --> 02:53:35.015]  It's going to have the interview for what you did with Tex Marr.
[02:53:35.635 --> 02:53:40.079]  It's going to have footage from the 522 Freemason Temple in Skinny Atlas.
[02:53:40.399 --> 02:53:44.602]  And I wanted to tell the local people to tune in if they're listening to the show right now.
[02:53:44.702 --> 02:53:46.484]  Well, you're on the road to a bigger world.
[02:53:46.544 --> 02:53:50.386]  Engaging the enemy will wake up thousands of people at every swing.
[02:53:50.407 --> 02:53:50.887]  Good job.
[02:53:51.536 --> 02:53:58.542]  Hey, Alex, I also watch Washington Journal quite a bit, and they have me on a list that they poll people from.
[02:53:58.562 --> 02:54:16.037]  I filled out the poll this morning, and they asked who we'd like to see on the show, and of course, I put your name in there, told them that I was quite upset about their loss of credibility after Brian Lamb interviewed the guy from Yale, who tried to tear you apart for an hour at least that one day, and...
[02:54:16.673 --> 02:54:19.754]  So hopefully we'll get some change and get you on that show one of these days.
[02:54:20.094 --> 02:54:21.814]  Well, thank you, and I appreciate the call.
[02:54:21.834 --> 02:54:22.614]  Good to hear from you.
[02:54:22.654 --> 02:54:23.474]  Pat in New York.
[02:54:23.514 --> 02:54:24.374]  You're on the air, Pat.
[02:54:24.414 --> 02:54:24.854]  Go ahead.
[02:54:24.874 --> 02:54:26.195]  Am I on?
[02:54:26.495 --> 02:54:26.735]  Yes.
[02:54:27.375 --> 02:54:32.936]  Hey, Alex, I just want to say that you're just a great big blessing to all of us fighting the New World Order out here.
[02:54:33.596 --> 02:54:34.316]  You guys are.
[02:54:34.376 --> 02:54:35.236]  I'm just doing my job.
[02:54:36.076 --> 02:54:39.157]  I just want to just... I guess let me just hit it right between the eyes here.
[02:54:39.937 --> 02:54:43.978]  Where is this whole thing... I mean, where is it going?
[02:54:44.038 --> 02:54:44.258]  I mean...
[02:54:45.583 --> 02:54:47.044]  You know, we're handing out videos.
[02:54:48.465 --> 02:54:49.026]  We're on film.
[02:54:49.046 --> 02:54:51.128]  We're getting the Access Channel working in a few weeks.
[02:54:51.968 --> 02:54:56.772]  We're showing Loose Change in a local theater.
[02:54:58.273 --> 02:55:05.059]  Watching that American History video last night, where do we go?
[02:55:05.259 --> 02:55:07.821]  These people are deeply, deeply entrenched.
[02:55:08.981 --> 02:55:12.824]  I know, but we're just trying to change that one hill at a time.
[02:55:12.884 --> 02:55:14.245]  We're defeating them on many fronts.
[02:55:14.806 --> 02:55:16.147]  They're having a lot of victories as well.
[02:55:16.187 --> 02:55:18.629]  We're in a war, sir, and knowing is half the battle.
[02:55:18.669 --> 02:55:19.429]  God bless you.
[02:55:19.469 --> 02:55:20.070]  Just keep it up.
[02:55:20.090 --> 02:55:20.650]  Do what you're doing.
[02:55:20.910 --> 02:55:21.411]  Last call.
[02:55:21.471 --> 02:55:22.572]  Phil in Pennsylvania.
[02:55:22.632 --> 02:55:23.112]  Go ahead, Phil.
[02:55:24.373 --> 02:55:28.316]  Alex, have you seen this release from the Associated Press?
[02:55:28.997 --> 02:55:30.318]  It's on foxnews.com.
[02:55:30.358 --> 02:55:33.141]  Bush administration media collusion memo surfaced.
[02:55:33.401 --> 02:55:34.582]  Yeah, I talked about it last hour.
[02:55:34.822 --> 02:55:35.402]  Oh, you did see that?
[02:55:35.422 --> 02:55:37.964]  Did you see the quote from Bill Frist at the bottom of this thing?
[02:55:38.445 --> 02:55:40.346]  I may not have seen that particular article.
[02:55:40.366 --> 02:55:40.627]  Tell me.
[02:55:40.647 --> 02:55:41.908]  Okay, here's the quote from Bill Frist.
[02:55:42.448 --> 02:55:46.151]  Of course it raises some concerns that we can't let this issue be blown out of proportion.
[02:55:46.611 --> 02:55:51.676]  Hell, if we want to plant ID chips in people and torture their loved ones until they break, we will.
[02:55:53.357 --> 02:55:53.997]  You're joking.
[02:55:54.318 --> 02:55:54.438]  No.
[02:55:55.800 --> 02:56:03.062]  So you're saying the Fox News piece on how they caught Bush telling the national news, controlling him, you're telling me Frist said that at the end of it.
[02:56:03.362 --> 02:56:04.583]  Is that on Fox News right now?
[02:56:05.003 --> 02:56:05.483]  Yes, it is.
[02:56:05.983 --> 02:56:10.164]  I will get it immediately and post it on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:56:10.604 --> 02:56:12.165]  And of course, Frist is the leader of the Senate.
[02:56:12.585 --> 02:56:14.905]  If that's true, they're just going insane right in front of us.
