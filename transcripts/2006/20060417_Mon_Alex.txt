[00:00:05.882 --> 00:00:06.543]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.203 --> 00:00:08.263]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.963 --> 00:00:10.103]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.724 --> 00:00:11.564]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.304 --> 00:00:13.204]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.864 --> 00:00:17.545]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.045 --> 00:00:22.126]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.522]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:34.622 --> 00:00:36.926]  It is the 17th day of April 2006.
[00:00:37.586 --> 00:00:40.631]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:40.651 --> 00:00:47.020]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours, and we've got a jam-packed broadcast for you today.
[00:00:48.021 --> 00:01:02.604]  But a lot of new developments concerning the Charlie Sheen story, how he first questioned the official 9-11 report as a fable, as a fiction, as the greatest conspiracy of them all, basically.
[00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:09.185]  He went on Jimmy Kimmel Live that comes on right after Nightline nationwide on ABC.
[00:01:10.025 --> 00:01:14.086]  We'll be playing that clip coming up in the next segment.
[00:01:15.262 --> 00:01:16.343]  Headline, U.S.
[00:01:16.663 --> 00:01:19.184]  plan for flu pandemic revealed.
[00:01:19.324 --> 00:01:23.086]  Multi-agency proposal awaits Bush approval.
[00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:26.088]  This is your martial law smokescreen.
[00:01:27.108 --> 00:01:31.170]  Also, fifth retired general calls for Rumsfeld's resignation.
[00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.013]  I actually count that as the eighth, but I guess it's the fifth in the last two weeks.
[00:01:37.174 --> 00:01:38.935]  Also, retired colonel claims U.S.
[00:01:38.975 --> 00:01:41.576]  military operations are already underway in Iran.
[00:01:42.176 --> 00:01:43.497]  We'll be getting into that report.
[00:01:45.384 --> 00:01:48.326]  Rumsfeld potentially liable for torture.
[00:01:48.346 --> 00:01:49.627]  That's what Reuters is reporting.
[00:01:50.107 --> 00:01:53.149]  We have his own orders, his own documents, his own memos.
[00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.893]  How do his underlings go to prison for following orders to torture, but he doesn't go to prison?
[00:01:59.313 --> 00:02:06.158]  Alberto Gonzalez, the Attorney General at the time when he wrote the memos, Chief White House Counsel, why doesn't he go to prison?
[00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.522]  And it dovetails nicely with an MSNBC report, America's Secret Police.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.041]  No, that's not Alex Jones saying that.
[00:02:15.421 --> 00:02:16.562]  That's MSNBC.
[00:02:16.662 --> 00:02:24.326]  Intelligence experts warn that a proposal to merge two Pentagon intelligence units could create an ominous new agency.
[00:02:24.386 --> 00:02:25.127]  I've got news for you.
[00:02:25.147 --> 00:02:26.788]  It's already been created.
[00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:42.317]  NYPD deploys first of 500 security cameras, other than to take all the traffic cameras and, quote, traffic systems, which were, again, put in dual use nationwide with federal money to track and control the population.
[00:02:42.337 --> 00:02:46.259]  We see reports like this every day from different cities around the country, but we'll get into this one.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.742]  Also, Qatar says OPEC can do nothing about high oil prices.
[00:02:52.102 --> 00:02:56.264]  Meanwhile, Exxon Chairman gets $400 million retirement package.
[00:02:57.131 --> 00:02:59.032]  Amid soaring gas prices.
[00:02:59.072 --> 00:03:00.292]  And it's not free market.
[00:03:00.872 --> 00:03:08.375]  And that $400 million retirement package is just a tiny fraction of a fraction of what's really going on.
[00:03:08.415 --> 00:03:14.377]  And we'll discuss why we're paying so much for gasoline right now and energy, period.
[00:03:14.417 --> 00:03:15.938]  And it dovetails with this headline.
[00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:21.040]  Gold storms to new 25-year high.
[00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.660]  Silver surges as well.
[00:03:25.512 --> 00:03:26.753]  We're good to go.
[00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:26.953]  I think?
[00:03:53.496 --> 00:03:56.759]  And by the way, China's hidden a lot of its growth, and we'll tell you why they've done that.
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:04.667]  Gingrich warns Republicans are in deep trouble, and that the American people are angry at Republicans.
[00:04:04.768 --> 00:04:05.849]  I wonder why.
[00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.992]  And Bush's new chief of staff signals shake-up.
[00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:17.588]  And how that goes along with what's happening with the borders that are completely open and much more today.
[00:04:17.628 --> 00:04:21.993]  The websites are jonesreport.com, now at Beta Daily.
[00:04:22.433 --> 00:04:23.635]  Really proud of that site.
[00:04:23.695 --> 00:04:24.956]  It's a quick download site.
[00:04:25.857 --> 00:04:29.582]  That is, it's not heavy on the bandwidth for those of you that don't have good connections.
[00:04:30.063 --> 00:04:37.573]  JonesReport.com, then there's Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and Infowars.net.
[00:04:37.933 --> 00:04:40.197]  Not to mention MartialLaw911.info, which is our 9-11 site.
[00:04:45.253 --> 00:04:47.356]  What, five minutes into the hour?
[00:04:47.436 --> 00:04:58.071]  We'll come back after a quick three-minute break and get straight into all the new Charlie Sheen developments and then the national, international news, the upcoming war with Iran, your phone calls, and a lot more.
[00:04:58.131 --> 00:04:58.632]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.924 --> 00:05:05.766]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:06.026 --> 00:05:06.727]  Hello, my friends.
[00:05:06.827 --> 00:05:07.607]  Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.947 --> 00:05:12.630]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.971 --> 00:05:19.715]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:20.035 --> 00:05:22.016]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:22.216 --> 00:05:25.057]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:25.157 --> 00:05:29.819]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:34.421]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.661 --> 00:05:41.884]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:42.144 --> 00:05:44.565]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:05:44.725 --> 00:05:46.506]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[00:05:46.526 --> 00:05:46.586]  1-888-253-3139

[00:06:02.702 --> 00:06:05.706]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:06:06.066 --> 00:06:14.877]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:06:15.197 --> 00:06:19.883]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:06:20.343 --> 00:06:27.070]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:39.223]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:39.723 --> 00:06:44.189]  The Berkey Lights rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:46.691]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:06:51.437 --> 00:06:52.638]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:01.872 --> 00:07:03.572]  What causes foods to spoil?
[00:07:03.992 --> 00:07:06.973]  All produce produces a natural gas which causes ripening.
[00:07:07.293 --> 00:07:12.574]  In addition, foods like onions and garlic emit odors, causing foods to lose their freshness and flavor.
[00:07:12.874 --> 00:07:22.416]  Now there's Forever Fresh for the fridge, a revolutionary new product proven to eliminate refrigerator odors and guaranteed to keep produce fresh at least twice as long as normal.
[00:07:22.696 --> 00:07:24.897]  Nancy McKimson of Jacksonville, Florida says...
[00:07:25.177 --> 00:07:28.739]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, everything stays fresh much longer.
[00:07:28.999 --> 00:07:32.221]  Like strawberries, which now last a couple of weeks instead of just a few days.
[00:07:32.501 --> 00:07:36.044]  Jane Burke of New Jersey says, You know, we eat a lot of salads.
[00:07:36.204 --> 00:07:39.686]  I used to throw out the leftovers because they'd turn brown and they'd shrivel up.
[00:07:39.806 --> 00:07:41.067]  I'm really amazed.
[00:07:41.227 --> 00:07:47.070]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, all my produce stays fresher longer, including the leftovers.
[00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.632]  Now I just couldn't get along without Forever Fresh.
[00:07:49.972 --> 00:07:58.097]  To order your Forever Fresh for the fridge, visit the web at foreverfresh.us or call toll-free 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[00:07:58.277 --> 00:08:00.278]  That's 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[00:08:01.459 --> 00:08:07.142]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:13.348 --> 00:08:21.695]  Well, more and more of the administration's martial law plan during a bird flu outbreak is becoming public knowledge.
[00:08:21.715 --> 00:08:22.476]  We'll get into that.
[00:08:23.697 --> 00:08:27.200]  Special Forces troops for at least a year and a half have been in Iran.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.121]  That's admitted.
[00:08:28.962 --> 00:08:32.304]  Rumsfeld could finally get in trouble for ordering torture.
[00:08:32.324 --> 00:08:40.491]  The question is, will his boss, George Bush, and Bush's other minions like John Yoo and Alberto Gonzalez, that wrote these bone-chilling...
[00:08:41.465 --> 00:08:42.846]  Memos, will they get in trouble?
[00:08:42.886 --> 00:08:44.527]  We'll get into all of that.
[00:08:44.627 --> 00:08:48.190]  Gold exploding to $606 plus an ounce.
[00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:49.671]  Silver exploding.
[00:08:49.951 --> 00:08:54.335]  Oil prices having a meteoric rise right now.
[00:08:54.715 --> 00:09:01.560]  We'll get into all of it today and give you a chance to respond, give you a chance to give the audience of millions your take, listeners.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.461]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:05.843]  I want to talk about Charlie Sheen right now, though.
[00:09:13.676 --> 00:09:24.907]  There are a lot of new developments concerning his questioning of the official 9-11 story starting, what, three weeks ago on this radio broadcast.
[00:09:26.409 --> 00:09:35.619]  And on Friday, he was live on the Jimmy Kimmel Show on national television.
[00:09:37.214 --> 00:09:47.602]  And during the lengthy discussion that Mr. Kimmel had with his guest, Charlie Sheen, he brought up his questioning of the 9-11 story.
[00:09:47.682 --> 00:09:51.405]  So let's go ahead and roll a clip of that segment.
[00:09:54.567 --> 00:09:57.670]  From Hollywood, it's Jimmy Kimmel Live!
[00:10:07.796 --> 00:10:16.565]  Our first guest tonight is not only a member of the world-famous Sheen family of actors, little known fact, also the genius behind the lucrative Afro-Sheen empire.
[00:10:16.665 --> 00:10:17.146]  That's right.
[00:10:17.346 --> 00:10:25.074]  You know him from movies like Platoon and Wall Street, and in addition to seeing him every week on Two and a Half Men, opening tonight you can see him in Scary Movie 4.
[00:10:25.174 --> 00:10:28.037]  Please welcome the indestructible Charlie Sheen!
[00:10:51.275 --> 00:10:51.755]  Thank you.
[00:10:51.815 --> 00:10:53.036]  Happy almost Easter.
[00:10:53.156 --> 00:10:53.956]  Hey, back at you.
[00:10:54.016 --> 00:10:54.356]  Thank you.
[00:10:54.416 --> 00:10:55.777]  You had some interesting comments.
[00:10:55.817 --> 00:11:05.440]  You were on a radio show, and you talked about 9-11, and you have... Is it a theory, or you just don't believe the government account of what happened on 9-11?
[00:11:06.521 --> 00:11:07.281]  I just had questions.
[00:11:07.501 --> 00:11:07.701]  Yeah?
[00:11:07.721 --> 00:11:17.785]  I had a lot of questions, and the forum I chose to voice those questions in is the Alex Jones Radio Show, and just because he's a guy that I've been a fan of and followed for a lot of years, and...
[00:11:19.349 --> 00:11:20.089]  Yeah, I got attacked.
[00:11:20.109 --> 00:11:21.230]  I mean, there were a lot of hit pieces.
[00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:22.391]  The reaction was pretty severe.
[00:11:22.411 --> 00:11:24.252]  People get very mad when celebrities have an opinion.
[00:11:24.292 --> 00:11:25.012]  No, I understand.
[00:11:25.032 --> 00:11:25.392]  I understand.
[00:11:25.432 --> 00:11:26.633]  I know he's not qualified.
[00:11:26.693 --> 00:11:33.356]  He doesn't... You know, he's just... Who the hell is he to have an opinion about something so horrible?
[00:11:33.576 --> 00:11:42.421]  And, you know, it was sad because they didn't really take a look at any of the stuff I was asking them to look at and any of the evidence or any of the stuff that generated those questions, you know?
[00:11:42.961 --> 00:11:47.243]  And they said, oh, he's another tinfoil hat-wearing Hollywood clown, you know?
[00:11:47.363 --> 00:11:48.124]  It's like the only...
[00:11:49.229 --> 00:11:57.575]  You know, I felt that the only real validation I needed was just being a tax-paying American that loves my country.
[00:11:57.976 --> 00:12:04.441]  Yeah, and you, I mean, it's just something that you wonder about, and you would like to know more about, I assume.
[00:12:04.581 --> 00:12:05.101]  Sure, sure.
[00:12:05.161 --> 00:12:11.986]  And you studied the tapes, and you... I've done a lot of research, and it's not just me, it's the people that have come before me, the experts and the...
[00:12:13.368 --> 00:12:17.691]  The engineers and the physicists and the scientists and the scholars that raised a lot of these things.
[00:12:17.732 --> 00:12:21.314]  And I took a look at their research and said, yeah, it doesn't add up.
[00:12:21.434 --> 00:12:22.435]  A lot of it doesn't add up.
[00:12:22.495 --> 00:12:23.996]  Hence these questions.
[00:12:24.957 --> 00:12:25.638]  There's two areas.
[00:12:25.658 --> 00:12:28.660]  There's Building 7 and there's the five frames from the Pentagon.
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:29.581]  Don't listen to me.
[00:12:29.821 --> 00:12:30.642]  Do your own research.
[00:12:30.682 --> 00:12:39.489]  But I think that what happened to a time in this country when we were entitled, when we had a constitutional and a God-given right to be curious about things that
[00:12:40.169 --> 00:12:41.010]  That didn't make sense.
[00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:41.830]  That's all it was.
[00:12:41.851 --> 00:12:45.614]  Well, because we have a lot of cable shows now, and they need stuff to be mad about.
[00:12:45.734 --> 00:12:50.177]  So, you know, stuff like this is like, oh boy, we could yell about this for an entire week.
[00:12:50.398 --> 00:12:54.241]  And plus, with your dad being the president and all, it puts a lot of the focus on him.
[00:12:54.281 --> 00:12:54.921]  That's true.
[00:12:55.081 --> 00:12:57.363]  Yeah, I should have conferred with him before I came out talking to you.
[00:12:57.463 --> 00:13:02.948]  All right, so there's a clip of Charlie Sheen last Friday night.
[00:13:04.108 --> 00:13:10.010]  Simply saying that it's his right as an American to question the official story.
[00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:23.855]  And then he, of course, brings up the fact that a lot of esteemed experts, a lot of physicists, scientists, researchers, scholars have been proving that the official story is a lie.
[00:13:25.416 --> 00:13:40.028]  Now, since then, there have been different film sites, different news sites, places like the National Ledger and others that have come out and attacked Sheen, claiming that what you just heard was a mea culpa or an apology or, hey, give me a pass.
[00:13:40.969 --> 00:13:42.470]  And that's not what's happening.
[00:13:42.611 --> 00:13:44.172]  Here's one out of a celebrity gossip.
[00:13:44.592 --> 00:13:46.474]  Charlie Sheen defends 911 questions.
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:14:04.524]  Charlie Sheen defends his comments about 9-1-1 on the Jimmy Kimmel Show last week while promoting Scary Movie 4, which, by the way, broke opening weekend box office records and making over $41 million, I would add, over the Easter weekend.
[00:14:04.564 --> 00:14:12.306]  So, again, Charlie Sheen defends his comments about 9-1-1 on the Jimmy Kimmel Show last week while promoting Scary Movie 4.
[00:14:13.266 --> 00:14:21.908]  The public attacked Sheen after asking questions about 9-1-1 on a national radio show, the general viewpoint being that he was just an actor.
[00:14:22.248 --> 00:14:25.349]  What right does he have to make such accusations?
[00:14:25.689 --> 00:14:28.850]  Now, the article goes on, but let's just stop right there.
[00:14:30.731 --> 00:14:38.173]  This celebrity gossip column just comes out and says that the majority of people disagree with Sheen.
[00:14:38.613 --> 00:14:40.033]  They show no evidence of that.
[00:14:40.373 --> 00:14:42.514]  They just state it as if it's the truth.
[00:14:43.277 --> 00:14:52.000]  And they also say basically that it's the general viewpoint that he is just an actor and that he's wrong.
[00:14:53.421 --> 00:14:58.143]  Here's another article out of the National Ledger that calls him Tom Cruise.
[00:14:58.503 --> 00:15:01.144]  I mean, that's how shoddy these writers are.
[00:15:01.989 --> 00:15:06.015]  Charlie Sheen wants a pass for the 9-11 conspiracy remarks.
[00:15:06.055 --> 00:15:14.266]  Two and a half men star Charlie Sheen is not happy that he was criticized after he joined the 9-11 conspiracy chorus on a national radio show last month.
[00:15:14.306 --> 00:15:17.811]  The comic actor tried to get serious and was...
[00:15:18.811 --> 00:15:27.053]  Sold as a credible voice by the conspiracy world as they deliberately seek publicity, any publicity, to get their wild 9-11 theories out.
[00:15:27.153 --> 00:15:39.855]  The wild theories that former German defense ministers and members of the Blair Cabinet and Congresswoman and, of course, scientists and doctors and the underwriters of the towers and it goes on and on.
[00:15:40.195 --> 00:15:46.256]  According to Contact Music UK, Cruz felt that the critics were not
[00:15:46.909 --> 00:15:48.629]  Warranted and wants a pass.
[00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:51.170]  So now they call him Tom Cruise.
[00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:56.291]  And right now, Ryan's writing an article about this in the office next to me.
[00:15:56.351 --> 00:16:08.034]  Ryan, be sure and point out that it's so shoddy that this writer, for a major publication, the National Ledger's pretty good size, gets it mixed up and is now calling him Tom Cruise.
[00:16:10.614 --> 00:16:13.375]  Now, so there's several points here.
[00:16:13.455 --> 00:16:13.635]  They...
[00:16:14.791 --> 00:16:17.572]  One minute he's Charlie Sheen, now he's Tom Cruise.
[00:16:19.113 --> 00:16:24.775]  And at the same time, they're claiming that he wants a pass, that he's saying he doesn't deserve this.
[00:16:24.855 --> 00:16:32.019]  No, he's saying he was attacked by hit pieces, and that it's his right as an American to have opinions, and that's what makes him credible.
[00:16:33.939 --> 00:16:42.223]  And then you have the other articles, and by the way, this is a theme on multiple newspapers and blogs that are writing about his Friday night appearance on the Jimmy Kimmel Live show.
[00:16:45.091 --> 00:16:57.495]  Where they then also come out and say, not only that he's, you know, mea culpa, give me a pass, not only do they say no one really agrees with him or the majority view is he's wrong, then they call him Tom Cruise on top of it.
[00:16:59.115 --> 00:16:59.915]  I mean, that's crazy.
[00:17:00.536 --> 00:17:08.518]  The forum I chose to voice those questions was the Alex Jones Radio Show just because he's a guy I've been a fan of and followed for a lot of years.
[00:17:09.418 --> 00:17:14.780]  And then they go on for page after page, a five-page article attacking Charlie Sheen
[00:17:16.312 --> 00:17:22.954]  So that's the shoddiness of those that attack Charlie Sheen and myself and others that simply question the official fraud.
[00:17:23.394 --> 00:17:28.995]  The entire official 9-11 story has been proven to be a lie from start to finish, up one side and down the other.
[00:17:29.195 --> 00:17:29.975]  That's not debatable.
[00:17:30.015 --> 00:17:31.456]  We know their official story is a lie.
[00:17:31.836 --> 00:17:33.836]  Then we can debate exactly what really happened.
[00:17:33.856 --> 00:17:40.878]  And you look at the evidence, you look at the motive, you look at the pre-planning, you look at who had the will to do this, and it's sterling crystal clear.
[00:17:43.647 --> 00:17:44.528]  Oh my goodness.
[00:17:45.148 --> 00:17:47.529]  We do have to commend Free Market News.
[00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:50.991]  They did a positive report, or a fair report.
[00:17:51.151 --> 00:17:52.872]  Sheen continues asking questions.
[00:17:53.852 --> 00:18:00.916]  And it says actor Charlie Sheen is back in the headlines, this time after an interview segment on Jimmy Kimmel Live on ABC on Friday night, April 14th.
[00:18:01.836 --> 00:18:03.557]  And it says Sheen reportedly...
[00:18:06.784 --> 00:18:13.507]  Question the attacks, and it goes on to say when Kimmel asked him about previous statements that he had made, he said he had questions, a lot of questions.
[00:18:14.307 --> 00:18:15.448]  And it just goes on from there.
[00:18:15.468 --> 00:18:22.031]  It talks about how he's put out a challenge to the media, saying please challenge me on the issues, on the facts.
[00:18:22.311 --> 00:18:36.157]  He also historically, as you just heard him earlier, raised Building 7 and said look at that, and look at the five photoshopped, and that's been proven, faked frames that the Pentagon released where it doesn't even show a jet aircraft.
[00:18:38.214 --> 00:18:44.408]  So again, I can only commend Charlie Sheen for what he's done and how he's spoken up and how he's gotten involved.
[00:18:46.417 --> 00:18:52.259]  But, again, the mainstream media refuses to respond to him on the issues.
[00:18:52.639 --> 00:19:06.705]  They refuse to go after Sheen on the facts, to challenge him on the facts, and he's thrown down the gauntlet on national television now himself for them to stop dodging the issues and face him on the facts.
[00:19:06.765 --> 00:19:12.067]  Now, a whole other wrinkle on this, probably the most important facet of it,
[00:19:14.122 --> 00:19:29.452]  Going back three weeks ago when we first broke the Charlie Sheen interview here on the GCN Radio Network, four days later, Google had not picked up our report on their web search or on their news search.
[00:19:31.253 --> 00:19:39.018]  Now, we can write an article about the most petty of issues that gets almost no traffic and it's on Google in a day.
[00:19:40.698 --> 00:19:41.939]  Not the case with Sheen.
[00:19:42.299 --> 00:19:47.481]  And we have clear censorship going on yet again.
[00:19:47.501 --> 00:19:52.283]  And last time we exposed it, within one hour, Google had reversed themselves.
[00:19:52.803 --> 00:19:55.224]  We'll give you the details when we get back after this quick break.
[00:19:55.945 --> 00:19:58.726]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:20:02.617 --> 00:20:11.682]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[00:20:11.922 --> 00:20:23.149]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:20:23.489 --> 00:20:28.712]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no
[00:20:28.712 --> 00:20:29.572]  We're good to go.
[00:20:53.826 --> 00:20:54.066]  803-4438.
[00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:56.368]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:20:56.728 --> 00:20:59.790]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:21:02.131 --> 00:21:03.072]  Here it is, folks.

[00:21:05.033 --> 00:21:07.475]  The most comprehensive edition ever published.

[00:21:12.658 --> 00:21:14.099]  It includes the history of U.S.
[00:21:14.179 --> 00:21:18.282]  coins, the actual mintages, the grading standards...
[00:21:18.894 --> 00:21:19.194]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:45.643 --> 00:21:49.845]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:21:50.465 --> 00:21:53.046]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for
[00:22:14.548 --> 00:22:17.530]  The antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[00:23:01.224 --> 00:23:09.747]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[00:23:09.967 --> 00:23:11.787]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[00:23:11.987 --> 00:23:13.188]  That's one in four adults.
[00:23:13.508 --> 00:23:19.590]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it, the American Heart Association calls it the silent killer.
[00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:23.551]  At researchedherbs.com, we recognize your concern for your well-being.

[00:24:03.314 --> 00:24:26.847]  So the first time we had Charlie Sheen on and had the headline, after Charlie Sheen questions official 9-11 story, it got linked on Drudge, it got linked on literally thousands of websites.
[00:24:26.887 --> 00:24:29.809]  We were getting millions of visitors an hour before
[00:24:30.478 --> 00:24:30.919]  We're good to go.
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:50.201]  We're good to go.
[00:24:50.221 --> 00:24:50.501]  I think?
[00:25:13.681 --> 00:25:16.643]  Okay, web, they pick up everything that gets a lot of visitors.
[00:25:17.103 --> 00:25:24.388]  And then if you check some obscure website that got 100 visitors, it might be link 557 on the Google pages.
[00:25:24.808 --> 00:25:26.069]  But our links are up at the top.
[00:25:26.629 --> 00:25:32.532]  And Google, we never requested it, but normally they'll just pick you up as a news affiliate.
[00:25:33.313 --> 00:25:39.236]  Google has never carried Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com news in their news section.
[00:25:39.277 --> 00:25:39.517]  When you...
[00:25:40.217 --> 00:25:40.757]  We're good to go.
[00:25:40.777 --> 00:25:41.017]  I think?
[00:26:03.957 --> 00:26:04.337]  Nothing.
[00:26:05.378 --> 00:26:08.341]  And four or five days in, we'd probably already written, what, about ten articles.
[00:26:08.741 --> 00:26:13.625]  They were all getting massive readership, and none of it was on Google Web.
[00:26:13.765 --> 00:26:20.650]  Now, other websites that had taken what we'd written and posted it, syndicated it, it was listed there.
[00:26:21.451 --> 00:26:25.994]  So they were clearly blocking out Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:26:26.074 --> 00:26:29.357]  Well, late Friday night, early Sunday,
[00:26:30.151 --> 00:26:40.434]  Saturday morning, depending on what time zone you're in, we were here, we recorded Jimmy Kimmel, we posted the video clip, we wrote an article, we had it up by about 2.30 a.m.
[00:26:40.634 --> 00:26:44.336]  Central, and the next day, nothing.
[00:26:44.576 --> 00:26:45.396]  Sunday, nothing.
[00:26:45.536 --> 00:26:46.456]  Today, nothing.
[00:26:46.916 --> 00:26:57.760]  But web articles mentioning it were up within hours Saturday, within hours Sunday, and now newspaper reports about it were up within minutes.
[00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.321]  Because they're news affiliates.
[00:27:00.401 --> 00:27:09.664]  We are listed now as a Google news affiliate, but they are not carrying any of the three Charlie Sheen articles that we have written over the weekend.
[00:27:10.464 --> 00:27:12.865]  One of them written within hours of Jimmy Kimmel Live.
[00:27:13.265 --> 00:27:17.367]  The next one written in the early morning hours, England time, about what, 8 a.m.?
[00:27:17.407 --> 00:27:18.307]  Paul wrote it over there.
[00:27:18.347 --> 00:27:19.447]  That would be 2 a.m.
[00:27:19.487 --> 00:27:21.848]  here, so he was writing it simultaneously.
[00:27:22.629 --> 00:27:23.589]  So clearly...
[00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:26.672]  Google is doing the same thing it does in China.
[00:27:27.252 --> 00:27:44.903]  They have got settings in their servers, whether it's by design or by accident, and clearly it looks like it's by design, all the evidence points there, to block out our original reporting and to block out the video clip that's up on YouTube right now with tens of thousands of viewers every few hours watching it.
[00:27:46.804 --> 00:27:50.126]  So it's very, very frustrating to see this happening.
[00:27:50.327 --> 00:27:52.368]  And for those that don't know, Google China...
[00:27:53.226 --> 00:27:53.746]  We're good to go.
[00:28:16.067 --> 00:28:19.250]  So please go to InfoWars.com and get all of our Sheen reporting.
[00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:23.994]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com, get all of our Sheen reporting, and email it to your entire email list.
[00:28:24.414 --> 00:28:29.499]  Get it out to everyone, and let Google know that they're not going to get away with censorship.
[00:28:29.539 --> 00:28:43.831]  Listen, when they censored Space War, which is a big Australian news site that just reports on the defense establishment and on high-tech weapons, and they got caught doing that, we came to Space Wars assistance, many others did, and Google relisted them.
[00:28:44.779 --> 00:28:53.646]  If we put up with this, if we let this happen, if we let them continue to do this, it will set the precedent and more and more will start getting blocked out.
[00:28:54.026 --> 00:28:56.167]  Now, they don't want to get caught doing this.
[00:28:56.247 --> 00:28:59.169]  That's why last time we caught them, they instantly reversed it.
[00:28:59.189 --> 00:29:01.371]  And then we said, okay, maybe it's a mistake.
[00:29:01.751 --> 00:29:02.872]  It clearly isn't.
[00:29:03.433 --> 00:29:04.653]  Our sites are set right.
[00:29:04.673 --> 00:29:10.318]  They've been looked at by IT experts in search engine listing.
[00:29:10.878 --> 00:29:13.460]  Everything we write, everything we do, everything we post,
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:18.943]  I mean, routinely when I do web searches on broad topics, Prison Planet, InfoWars, are top.
[00:29:20.123 --> 00:29:22.605]  So our stories get picked up.
[00:29:22.705 --> 00:29:24.126]  Selective ones don't.
[00:29:24.146 --> 00:29:28.428]  There's keywords set in the Google software to block us.
[00:29:28.488 --> 00:29:29.648]  They need to relist.
[00:29:30.089 --> 00:29:31.609]  They need to stop what they're doing.
[00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:34.251]  So it runs the gamut.
[00:29:34.271 --> 00:29:37.773]  We've got the media claiming that Sheen has done a mea culpa and backed off.
[00:29:37.893 --> 00:29:38.393]  Not true.
[00:29:38.533 --> 00:29:39.013]  Claiming he's...
[00:29:41.457 --> 00:29:42.758]  Tom Cruise, not true.
[00:29:42.959 --> 00:29:45.421]  Claiming that the majority of people don't agree with him, not true.
[00:29:45.461 --> 00:29:46.522]  The polls show the opposite.
[00:29:47.123 --> 00:29:49.044]  We'll come back and get into other news and take your calls.
[00:29:49.065 --> 00:29:49.485]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.887 --> 00:29:52.808]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.289 --> 00:29:54.890]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.811 --> 00:29:58.514]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.818 --> 00:30:07.803]  So you take care of your car, you change the oil, tune it up on a regular basis, and always make sure that it's running at its best.
[00:30:08.003 --> 00:30:10.345]  When it comes to your car, you demand performance.
[00:30:10.585 --> 00:30:18.871]  That's why you need SFR's Protecta synthetic oil treatments, Protecta engine treatment, Protecta transmission treatment, and Protecta complete fuel system treatment.

[00:32:50.316 --> 00:32:55.541]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:32:55.721 --> 00:32:57.723]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:17.794 --> 00:33:28.623]  We played that earlier clip with Charlie Sheen, and somehow when it got transferred over the web, it had a little bit of a hum to it, so the network's re-uploaded a raw clip right off the TV program.
[00:33:29.323 --> 00:33:32.145]  We'll air that again in case you missed it later in the broadcast.
[00:33:32.165 --> 00:33:33.206]  And I've only aired it once.
[00:33:33.447 --> 00:33:34.387]  I might replay.
[00:33:34.407 --> 00:33:35.568]  We've had requests to do it.
[00:33:36.389 --> 00:33:43.855]  My two CNN appearances from a few weeks ago, because that is some riveting information, and we get into the...
[00:33:44.915 --> 00:33:49.745]  Bare knuckles info on 9-11 being an inside job on national TV.
[00:33:49.786 --> 00:33:53.594]  And so perhaps if we have time, we'll re-air that today.
[00:33:56.058 --> 00:34:00.401]  We're going to be going to Buddy and Pam and Pat and others here in just a few minutes.
[00:34:00.421 --> 00:34:04.323]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:04.343 --> 00:34:10.407]  And this whole Charlie Sheen thing, it isn't just about 9-11.
[00:34:10.447 --> 00:34:18.993]  It isn't just about his courageous stand to get the truth out and get people talking and to get tens of millions of Americans and people globally to start looking at 9-11.
[00:34:19.353 --> 00:34:23.136]  It's also a laboratory test of the controlled media system
[00:34:23.696 --> 00:34:24.637]  It's a window in the spin.
[00:34:36.075 --> 00:34:40.218]  I mean, can you believe that the media is coming out and going, oh, he's backing off.
[00:34:40.398 --> 00:34:41.659]  He's saying he got attacked.
[00:34:42.379 --> 00:34:43.140]  He didn't say that.
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:46.062]  He said it's his right and that he was attacked.
[00:34:46.102 --> 00:34:48.043]  He didn't say he was attacked by the majority.
[00:34:48.503 --> 00:34:56.168]  And then these articles that are out attacking him about his Jimmy Kimmel appearance come out and say, oh, the majority of people don't agree with him.
[00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:58.310]  Oh, and they show no evidence of that.
[00:35:00.214 --> 00:35:05.976]  We have two scientific Zogby polls showing the majority of American people agree with Sheen's statements.
[00:35:06.356 --> 00:35:13.899]  We have CNN doing a poll a year ago with Anderson Cooper with 90% taking the official stories of fraud.
[00:35:13.919 --> 00:35:22.422]  83% on CNN after a three-day poll with over 53,000 respondents agreeing with Sheen.
[00:35:22.442 --> 00:35:23.403]  And then people say, well...
[00:35:24.699 --> 00:35:29.781]  You know, you can't trust that poll on CNN with people on the Internet going and clicking and voting.
[00:35:29.841 --> 00:35:30.761]  It's not scientific.
[00:35:31.421 --> 00:35:32.202]  Well, let me tell you something.
[00:35:32.242 --> 00:35:35.463]  I've looked at hundreds of blogs, hundreds of hit pieces.
[00:35:35.523 --> 00:35:36.623]  Literally, there have been hundreds.
[00:35:37.304 --> 00:35:46.287]  And when you go even read a hit piece with the writer savaging Sheen and myself and others, the majority of the post...
[00:35:47.335 --> 00:36:01.990]  On these websites, even when it's a friendly neocon website that you would think would be getting traffic mainly by neocon mindless idiots, the majority, I mean in some cases there would be 700, 800, 1,000 plus responses.
[00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:07.957]  In one case there was the Scripps Howard News Service piece where the former Reagan administration official wrote the hit piece.
[00:36:08.657 --> 00:36:19.507]  Attacking Sheen and claiming that I had sent her an email calling her a whore, and I demanded a retraction, and Scripps Howard News Service had to, admitting that, okay, I hadn't sent an email saying that.
[00:36:19.828 --> 00:36:21.009]  They just made that up.
[00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:29.837]  And literally, there were, last time I checked, just over 800 responses, and almost every response, I mean, I'd read 30, 40, 50.
[00:36:30.678 --> 00:36:32.960]  I had to quit reading, and then you'd find one person
[00:36:34.091 --> 00:36:39.713]  One person calling names and saying we should all be arrested or we're all traitors, incoherent, mindless.
[00:36:39.994 --> 00:36:50.318]  The people standing up for Sheen and others that are calling for an investigation, they were well-spoken, intelligent, informed, filling their comments with hyperlinks to documentation of what they were claiming.
[00:36:52.779 --> 00:36:53.340]  We're good to go.
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:53.600]  I think?
[00:37:12.978 --> 00:37:19.903]  And I bet as soon as the National Ledger discovers they've got a typo calling him Tom Cruise, they'll alter that.
[00:37:19.923 --> 00:37:24.065]  That's why we need a screenshot, guys, of that before they take it down.
[00:37:26.067 --> 00:37:40.176]  And we're putting out two different reports today about the Google censorship, which is really important, clear censorship yet again of the Sheen story, selective censorship, and then on top of that, what will be...
[00:37:42.831 --> 00:37:50.855]  ...reporting on is how the media tries to spin it, that he came out and basically backed off, backtracked, apologized, and that the majority of people don't agree with him.
[00:37:51.615 --> 00:37:52.295]  That's a lie.
[00:37:53.276 --> 00:37:57.658]  So guys, make sure that we... I know my guys are going to be writing articles right now in between ten different things.
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:10.303]  That we also make the point about Google, that we make the point about how they spin it and claim he's backtracking, and how they spin it and claim that the majority of people don't support him when there's no evidence of that.
[00:38:10.363 --> 00:38:13.624]  We have the polls, scientific, unscientific, and the blogs.
[00:38:15.824 --> 00:38:25.847]  I mean, when a site like BravoCharlie911.com comes out of nowhere and has hundreds and hundreds of thousands of visitors, I've gone and looked at their net traffic a day.
[00:38:27.725 --> 00:38:28.826]  We're good to go.
[00:38:57.288 --> 00:38:58.349]  And so much more.
[00:38:58.429 --> 00:39:01.191]  Gold exploding, silver exploding, oil exploding.
[00:39:01.511 --> 00:39:02.592]  Why is that happening?
[00:39:04.253 --> 00:39:07.835]  Oil execs retiring, getting $400 million plus.
[00:39:08.716 --> 00:39:09.696]  We'll get into all of it.
[00:39:10.056 --> 00:39:11.237]  Buddy in Virginia.
[00:39:11.337 --> 00:39:12.938]  Buddy, thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:39:13.198 --> 00:39:14.159]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[00:39:14.219 --> 00:39:16.240]  Top of the day to you from Virginia.
[00:39:16.501 --> 00:39:16.921]  Thank you.
[00:39:17.901 --> 00:39:21.824]  My hat's off to Charlie Sheen and for his courage.
[00:39:22.524 --> 00:39:23.045]  It's hard.
[00:39:23.205 --> 00:39:24.786]  I've got a brother and a sister...
[00:39:25.526 --> 00:39:29.329]  That have both graduated from Liberty University at Jerry Falwell's college.
[00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:35.314]  And, you know, they believe the government line right down the line, you know.
[00:39:35.394 --> 00:39:38.757]  And it's hard to convince them different sometimes.
[00:39:38.817 --> 00:39:47.944]  And they do nothing but worship and support Israel, no matter who's in office there, no matter the fact that Christians who proselytize or preach on the street are arrested.
[00:39:48.484 --> 00:39:49.265]  Exactly, yeah.
[00:39:49.815 --> 00:39:52.816]  I mean, basically, when you go to Liberty University, you don't learn about the Bible.
[00:39:53.117 --> 00:40:05.562]  You learn about worshiping world government and worshiping neocons and just supporting Israel and calling anyone an antichrist who reports on Israel and their drug dealing or their child kidnapping rings.
[00:40:05.683 --> 00:40:10.665]  Yeah, well, that appears... I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't experienced it myself, you know.
[00:40:11.263 --> 00:40:12.324]  What do they say?
[00:40:12.364 --> 00:40:14.465]  Like, you bring up stuff and they go, that's of the devil!
[00:40:14.605 --> 00:40:16.246]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:40:16.446 --> 00:40:17.207]  No, I mean, is that accurate?
[00:40:17.227 --> 00:40:19.128]  I mean, describe how, I mean, describe it.
[00:40:19.408 --> 00:40:30.396]  Well, my brother, I've discussed it with him more so than my sister, and I've given him your tapes and the Loose Change video, just bought them and just give them to him to have, you know.
[00:40:31.216 --> 00:40:37.200]  And I'm not sure, you know, I think he thinks it's a waste of time to watch it.
[00:40:37.961 --> 00:40:39.482]  I don't think he wants to be informed.
[00:40:39.522 --> 00:40:40.062]  I think he's,
[00:40:40.936 --> 00:40:45.119]  Figures he knows enough since he's been to college that his mind is just closed to it.
[00:40:45.239 --> 00:40:47.020]  He's willfully ignorant.
[00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:47.960]  Exactly, yeah.
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:41:00.008]  But what I wanted to do, I wanted to shift gears just a little bit and ask your take on this dog and pony show we've got going on up in Alexandria called the Zacharias Mazzelli trial.
[00:41:00.768 --> 00:41:02.289]  I wanted to get your take on that.
[00:41:02.958 --> 00:41:04.039]  Well, I mean, what do you say?
[00:41:04.519 --> 00:41:06.721]  They've had the guy for over four and a half years.
[00:41:07.541 --> 00:41:09.923]  Everyone challenges them to bring it to trial.
[00:41:10.803 --> 00:41:20.430]  The judge says the whole thing's a fraud but doesn't declare a mistrial and says they've framed evidence, coached witnesses, lied, withheld documents.
[00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:21.991]  They won't let him have a defense.
[00:41:24.622 --> 00:41:28.306]  Michelle says he's a patsy and that it's all staged and he was set up.
[00:41:28.746 --> 00:41:35.733]  He demands to call his, quote, other unnamed co-unindicted conspirators.
[00:41:35.773 --> 00:41:37.175]  Turns out they're government agents.
[00:41:37.575 --> 00:41:38.896]  The government refuses.
[00:41:39.437 --> 00:41:41.419]  And then suddenly he's got a big shock attack.
[00:41:41.699 --> 00:41:41.979]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:41.999 --> 00:41:42.339]  Exactly.
[00:42:08.843 --> 00:42:23.735]  I noticed, I think it was reported on the news Friday, how they just had the last half hour of the flight recording tape, and they said the cockpit had already been took over, and would it take them about 15 minutes to get to Payne Stewart?
[00:42:23.755 --> 00:42:28.238]  That was before 9-11, you know, before all this heightened security and everything.
[00:42:28.318 --> 00:42:30.360]  It's still routine procedure for
[00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:36.792]  But just to be scrambled whenever it's an anomaly up in the air that they can't figure out.
[00:42:36.812 --> 00:42:37.352]  Well, exactly.
[00:42:37.813 --> 00:42:39.434]  Here's an example of what you raised.
[00:42:39.874 --> 00:42:51.000]  I forget the guy's exact name, but in the Popular Mechanics hit piece, they had a NORAD spokesman, an Air Force officer, and he says, it's a ridiculous conspiracy to say that we intercepted hundreds of flights.
[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:53.541]  We've never intercepted one flight.
[00:42:53.561 --> 00:42:56.163]  I mean, it actually says that.
[00:42:56.183 --> 00:42:56.463]  You go...
[00:42:57.193 --> 00:43:01.436]  You go, wait a minute, you intercepted Payne Stewart in, what was it, 2000?
[00:43:01.696 --> 00:43:02.197]  Yeah.
[00:43:03.017 --> 00:43:16.508]  And then we did a Google search under that officer's name, and there were press conferences he'd given in 99 and then in 2000 with Payne Stewart bragging how we had 60, I think it was 67 intercepts in the 12 months before 9-11.
[00:43:22.187 --> 00:43:27.872]  Or in the one year before Payne Stewart, and we got our planes up in an average of 15 minutes to intercept the target.
[00:43:27.912 --> 00:43:29.474]  So you can go read him.
[00:43:30.094 --> 00:43:32.616]  It was a Reuters article about a press conference.
[00:43:32.656 --> 00:43:37.561]  The very guy gave, bragging about their 67 intercepts the year before Payne Stewart.
[00:43:38.021 --> 00:43:42.245]  Then here he is, up on TV and then being interviewed by the...
[00:43:43.546 --> 00:43:51.112]  By the CIA written, you know, Benjamin Chertoff's cousin, Homeland Security written hit piece, just made up of straw men.
[00:43:51.412 --> 00:43:52.113]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:52.153 --> 00:43:58.438]  And I think that the two towers had already been hit, so they knew there was something going on, you know.
[00:43:59.018 --> 00:44:11.728]  But I did see on, I believe it was on somebody's video, where Rumsfeld was over in Iraq and he did admit that the people that shot down that Flight 77 were heroes
[00:44:13.286 --> 00:44:13.966]  In his mind.
[00:44:14.727 --> 00:44:25.933]  Yeah, no, he has slipped up twice and said the people that shot down Flight 93 are over Pennsylvania are great heroes.
[00:44:26.853 --> 00:44:30.135]  He's also slipped up twice and said the missile that hit the Pentagon.
[00:44:31.156 --> 00:44:33.357]  Yeah, I heard that.
[00:44:34.237 --> 00:44:35.098]  Now then, yeah.
[00:44:35.398 --> 00:44:41.261]  Well, Alex, look, I appreciate you talking to me, and I've listened to you ever since you've been on shortwave, probably 10, 12 years.
[00:44:43.366 --> 00:44:58.592]  And people in Virginia need waking up, and, you know, I'm trying to get the word out, but there's still a lot of people asleep around here, and all we can do is just pray for them and just hope they wake up before it's too late.
[00:44:58.732 --> 00:44:59.092]  I hear you.
[00:44:59.132 --> 00:45:00.673]  I appreciate your call, my friend.
[00:45:01.273 --> 00:45:03.534]  Let's go ahead and talk to Pat in Ohio.
[00:45:03.594 --> 00:45:04.435]  Pat, you're on the air.
[00:45:08.176 --> 00:45:08.756]  She's got her.
[00:45:08.776 --> 00:45:09.056]  Hello?
[00:45:09.196 --> 00:45:09.557]  Hello?
[00:45:09.677 --> 00:45:11.297]  Yeah, Pat, I need you to turn the radio off.
[00:45:11.938 --> 00:45:12.698]  Okay, I was on the...
[00:45:13.482 --> 00:45:13.822]  Internet.
[00:45:14.202 --> 00:45:16.384]  That's okay, but I'm going to have to let you go if you don't turn it off.
[00:45:16.624 --> 00:45:16.904]  Okay.
[00:45:19.305 --> 00:45:21.207]  Folks, just hold on a second, Pat.
[00:45:21.227 --> 00:45:21.847]  I've got to say this.
[00:45:22.007 --> 00:45:26.870]  There's an etiquette just so we can hear everybody, so we can move to the callers.
[00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:28.531]  Everybody's got to turn their radios off.
[00:45:29.712 --> 00:45:35.895]  And, I mean, this is a talk radio rule, and I don't know why our listeners more and more just refuse to do that.
[00:45:35.935 --> 00:45:36.816]  But go ahead, Pat.
[00:45:37.222 --> 00:45:39.703]  Okay, I ran to the other room, so I thought I was good to go.
[00:45:39.723 --> 00:45:40.844]  I'm not mad at you personally.
[00:45:40.864 --> 00:45:41.604]  It's just got to stop.
[00:45:41.624 --> 00:45:41.944]  Go ahead.
[00:45:41.964 --> 00:45:43.745]  Right, okay.
[00:45:44.366 --> 00:45:48.488]  I wanted the email address to write to Google again.
[00:45:49.408 --> 00:45:51.709]  Well, I mean, if you just go to Google, there should be a contact page.
[00:45:51.769 --> 00:45:53.490]  I don't have their email address in front of me.
[00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:56.992]  Oh, just go to the contact page and just put in my comments?
[00:45:58.075 --> 00:45:59.156]  That would be nice, yes.
[00:45:59.416 --> 00:46:11.642]  I would really appreciate that because they continually are blocking and filtering Sheen news until we catch them and then they reverse it, which I don't want to be in the business of every month complaining about it until they reverse themselves.
[00:46:11.962 --> 00:46:14.923]  Pretty soon we'll all get desensitized and just start accepting it.
[00:46:16.464 --> 00:46:22.467]  Okay, and secondly, I think it was last week, maybe two weeks ago, you were talking about the Israelis radiating their children.
[00:46:22.827 --> 00:46:23.127]  Yes.
[00:46:23.227 --> 00:46:25.048]  And you said to go to the search engine.
[00:46:25.088 --> 00:46:25.648]  Well, I did.
[00:46:25.668 --> 00:46:26.549]  I think it was Google.
[00:46:26.589 --> 00:46:27.229]  I did it with
[00:46:27.887 --> 00:46:32.308]  And I put in Israel radiating their children or something.
[00:46:32.328 --> 00:46:36.269]  Just a few words to bring up that type of news article.
[00:46:36.289 --> 00:46:39.690]  Yeah, I said type in Israel's ringworm children.
[00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:43.891]  Ringworm children.
[00:46:43.911 --> 00:46:44.191]  Okay.
[00:46:45.932 --> 00:46:47.512]  That was really what I called about.
[00:46:47.532 --> 00:46:48.152]  Did you find it?
[00:46:48.372 --> 00:46:50.953]  No, I didn't put in those key words.
[00:46:51.013 --> 00:46:52.153]  Ringworm or anything like that.
[00:46:52.173 --> 00:46:54.814]  I just put in Israel radiating their children.
[00:46:57.395 --> 00:46:58.376]  Anything else on your mind?
[00:46:58.396 --> 00:46:59.196]  No, that's it.
[00:46:59.476 --> 00:47:00.477]  All right, Pat, I appreciate it.
[00:47:00.497 --> 00:47:01.657]  I'm glad I can answer your questions.
[00:47:01.697 --> 00:47:10.882]  And I'm not trying to get overly wrought here about, it's just, you know, last week I'd go to like, I'd say two callers out of five had their radios just cranked all the way up.
[00:47:10.962 --> 00:47:14.443]  And then I'd have to take time out and say, please turn your radio off.
[00:47:14.483 --> 00:47:15.684]  People wouldn't turn it off.
[00:47:15.784 --> 00:47:17.385]  And I was just going, what's going on here?
[00:47:18.585 --> 00:47:21.547]  I'm hearing myself delayed 10, 15 seconds in the background.
[00:47:24.073 --> 00:47:25.594]  And it's just got to stop.
[00:47:25.995 --> 00:47:29.658]  Going back to Israel's ringworm children, why are they called the ringworm children?
[00:47:30.879 --> 00:47:39.626]  Because there was a documentary that aired last year on national Israeli television called Israel's Ringworm Children.
[00:47:40.686 --> 00:47:43.969]  And that was just one of the excuses.
[00:47:44.069 --> 00:47:53.677]  It was 110,000 Sephardic or Sephardi Jews, that's the Jews that migrated to North Africa and to Spain and other areas of Europe,
[00:47:54.818 --> 00:48:05.360]  About 25% of the Jewish population, and they're actually one of the old-line Jewish group of tribes that can actually hail from the Promised Land.
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:16.722]  And they have always, in the last 500 to 600 years, been fed upon by the Ashkenazi, or the Khazarian Jews.
[00:48:16.762 --> 00:48:20.243]  And this is in Encyclopedia Judaica.
[00:48:20.908 --> 00:48:21.588]  We're good to go.
[00:48:21.608 --> 00:48:21.849]  I think?
[00:48:41.519 --> 00:49:04.563]  What was it, about 800 years ago from my research, 850 years ago or so, when the Sephardi and the Ashkenazi began coming into contact in Europe, the rabbis, the Sephardi rabbis said, you know, these Khazarians are Jews, they're under the covenant, but they've converted, and so we're not allowed to intermarry with them.
[00:49:04.583 --> 00:49:06.824]  You know, that's part of a Jewish bloodline thing.
[00:49:06.844 --> 00:49:07.104]  That's what...
[00:49:08.067 --> 00:49:19.332]  I guess, you know, whole sections of the Old Testament are about the bloodlines and the families and this fellow beget, that fellow beget, this fellow beget, that fellow beget, this son of that son of this son with this woman.
[00:49:21.333 --> 00:49:26.755]  And that made the Ashkenazi extremely upset.
[00:49:26.835 --> 00:49:28.196]  And the Ashkenazi were more numerous.
[00:49:28.776 --> 00:49:30.397]  And so you see this over and over again.
[00:49:30.417 --> 00:49:31.637]  And so there was a big report there.
[00:49:31.657 --> 00:49:32.158]  And the U.S.
[00:49:32.178 --> 00:49:34.379]  government, for those that missed it, paid $3 billion.
[00:49:36.659 --> 00:49:39.421]  And that was in 1950's money.
[00:49:39.501 --> 00:49:50.989]  From 1950 to 1961, for 10,000 children a year, in a quote, radiation, long-term radiation study, to be given different doses of radiation.
[00:49:51.969 --> 00:49:56.612]  And a large portion, all the numbers have been in Haratz and Jerusalem Post, and Barry Hamish has written about it.
[00:49:57.293 --> 00:49:58.093]  This is admitted.
[00:49:58.133 --> 00:50:00.235]  You understand major Israeli newspapers.
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:04.481]  And the majority died within a week.
[00:50:04.861 --> 00:50:06.201]  Many died within a month or a year.
[00:50:06.221 --> 00:50:08.702]  A few hundred are still alive.
[00:50:08.762 --> 00:50:09.922]  And you know them in Israel.
[00:50:09.942 --> 00:50:10.463]  They're known.
[00:50:10.703 --> 00:50:11.483]  They're ball-headed.
[00:50:11.503 --> 00:50:13.823]  A lot of them are mentally retarded.
[00:50:15.384 --> 00:50:22.786]  And they would tell the parents, you're going to have dental work done, or you're going to be checked for lice, you're going to be checked for ringworm.
[00:50:24.786 --> 00:50:28.888]  And they brutally murdered and tortured and maimed 110,000
[00:50:31.661 --> 00:50:32.442]  Of these children.
[00:50:34.743 --> 00:50:39.908]  And anybody who speaks out against this gets attacked by the ADL.
[00:50:39.928 --> 00:50:45.032]  Because, you know, if you're against killing Jewish children, you must be bad.
[00:50:46.613 --> 00:50:48.374]  So, alright, fine.
[00:50:49.515 --> 00:50:50.596]  I don't want to kill Jews.
[00:50:51.096 --> 00:50:51.757]  I'm a Nazi.
[00:50:52.497 --> 00:50:55.520]  I didn't fund Hitler like the labor Zionists did.
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:57.922]  You guys should be really ashamed of yourselves.
[00:51:02.085 --> 00:51:03.627]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.787 --> 00:51:06.870]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:10.894]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.954 --> 00:51:15.179]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:51:15.539 --> 00:51:19.303]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:19.463 --> 00:51:21.245]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:21.505 --> 00:51:24.748]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[00:51:24.788 --> 00:51:29.491]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:29.652 --> 00:51:32.694]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[00:51:32.874 --> 00:51:35.736]  They are being led into the Sandpoint brig.
[00:51:36.237 --> 00:51:42.342]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.882 --> 00:51:43.323]  We're good to go.
[00:52:01.905 --> 00:52:05.488]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:52:05.528 --> 00:52:06.028]  are located?
[00:52:06.228 --> 00:52:09.610]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:14.554]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:52:14.814 --> 00:52:19.837]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[00:52:19.997 --> 00:52:20.678]  We're good to go.
[00:52:40.131 --> 00:52:42.774]  That's 888-803-4438 to order on the web or at BerkeyWater.com.

[00:53:18.343 --> 00:53:18.663]  Thank you.
[00:53:38.473 --> 00:53:39.074]  We're good to go.
[00:54:02.572 --> 00:54:05.354]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:54:05.374 --> 00:54:09.237]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:12.519 --> 00:54:18.223]  We're going to have open phones and cover the news today.
[00:54:18.283 --> 00:54:23.506]  Very important information coming up on what's happening with gold, oil, silver, Iran.
[00:54:23.706 --> 00:54:26.528]  More and more top generals, almost on a daily basis, every two days.
[00:54:26.568 --> 00:54:27.829]  I've averaged it out in the last week.
[00:54:29.290 --> 00:54:31.972]  Or even in the last week, five generals, so that's...
[00:54:33.047 --> 00:54:35.608]  Every day and a half or so, we have people going public.
[00:54:36.848 --> 00:54:39.129]  So we'll be covering that as well.
[00:54:39.189 --> 00:54:43.830]  Before I go to Kevin in Alabama, who I think disagrees with me, so we'll let him on for a minute or so.
[00:54:43.850 --> 00:54:44.671]  That's the rule here.
[00:54:44.691 --> 00:54:47.972]  I like to have folks who disagree with me, even if it's normally pretty ridiculous.
[00:54:48.872 --> 00:55:00.435]  But before we do that, I hope you'll go to Infowars.com and get a hard copy of my best 9-11 film, Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State, and make copies of it and spread the word and get it out to people.
[00:55:00.515 --> 00:55:01.996]  And your purchase supports this broadcast.
[00:55:02.921 --> 00:55:05.283]  I hope you'll get Road to Tyranny.
[00:55:05.303 --> 00:55:05.824]  9-11 and Road to Tyranny.
[00:55:05.844 --> 00:55:07.905]  I hope you'll get Loose Change 2nd Edition that we carry.
[00:55:07.945 --> 00:55:09.447]  Get an original DVD copy.
[00:55:09.547 --> 00:55:10.387]  Watch it online.
[00:55:10.888 --> 00:55:12.409]  See it on DVD.
[00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:18.935]  I hope you'll go to Infowars.com and look at all the books and videos and books on tape and t-shirts that we carry.
[00:55:19.155 --> 00:55:24.720]  It's all about getting the word out at Infowars.com at the secure online shopping cart there at the video and bookstore.
[00:55:25.518 --> 00:55:37.048]  Or go to PrisonPlanet.tv, get a monthly membership for $5.95, download all 14 of my films, my weekly TV show, my in-studio video reports, my book, Paul Watson's book, a bunch of other films have been authorized to post.
[00:55:37.449 --> 00:55:45.916]  PrisonPlanet.tv, get a monthly membership for $5.95, or get a yearly and get three months free at PrisonPlanet.tv, or call toll-free.
[00:55:45.936 --> 00:55:48.899]  They can answer your questions and take your order over the phone if you'd like to do it that way.
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:49.640]  One...
[00:55:50.913 --> 00:55:51.033]  888-253-3139.
[00:55:51.053 --> 00:55:51.253]  That's 888.
[00:55:51.313 --> 00:55:52.894]  Oh, and by the way, I never give this out.
[00:55:52.914 --> 00:55:58.618]  You can also write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[00:55:58.638 --> 00:55:59.658]  But again, that number is 888-253-3139.
[00:55:59.698 --> 00:56:00.779]  Let's go ahead and go to Kevin.
[00:56:00.799 --> 00:56:02.080]  Kevin in Alabama, go ahead.
[00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:02.980]  Hey, man, what's going on?
[00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:22.681]  Doing a radio show, just went to your phone call.
[00:56:23.182 --> 00:56:25.163]  All right, I got an open challenge for you.
[00:56:26.064 --> 00:56:28.245]  I called you a couple days ago.
[00:56:28.345 --> 00:56:32.308]  I told you I have pictures of Charlie Sheen at a Illuminati meeting.
[00:56:32.808 --> 00:56:37.832]  I said that I saw it on the History Channel on a show called Secret Societies.
[00:56:38.292 --> 00:56:39.253]  I have it taped.
[00:56:39.733 --> 00:56:42.195]  I'm prepared to drive to Austin, Texas.
[00:56:42.961 --> 00:56:44.482]  And bring it to you personally.
[00:56:44.962 --> 00:56:46.463]  Hey, listen, I want to see this.
[00:56:46.523 --> 00:56:47.163]  I want to hear it.
[00:56:48.664 --> 00:56:56.348]  I put the call out to listeners if they've seen this, and normally we have such a large audience, the listeners have seen anything or everything that's been on TV.
[00:56:56.408 --> 00:56:58.930]  No one called saying they'd seen this.
[00:56:59.310 --> 00:57:07.094]  And so if you have it, sir, you have a VCR, you can cue it up, you can turn the speaker up, and you can put the phone up against it, and I can hear it.
[00:57:07.935 --> 00:57:08.255]  Dude, how?
[00:57:08.846 --> 00:57:10.648]  How are you going to hear it when you need to see it?
[00:57:11.028 --> 00:57:11.889]  Okay, all right.
[00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:15.252]  Listen, Kevin, I'm trying to work this out with you.
[00:57:15.273 --> 00:57:16.354]  I'm trying to be fair here.
[00:57:16.994 --> 00:57:19.276]  People call in all the time and play clips on air.
[00:57:19.317 --> 00:57:20.378]  I'm sure you've heard that, right?
[00:57:23.441 --> 00:57:23.941]  Excuse me?
[00:57:27.585 --> 00:57:28.366]  Come on, Kevin.
[00:57:28.446 --> 00:57:30.748]  Please, just get it together for me for a second.
[00:57:32.305 --> 00:57:32.985]  Oh, he's swearing.
[00:57:33.025 --> 00:57:33.806]  We had to fade him down.
[00:57:34.026 --> 00:57:34.726]  Just keep him down.
[00:57:35.226 --> 00:57:39.747]  Yeah, I predicted he'd do that, and I even told the folks on the show, I said, be ready.
[00:57:40.868 --> 00:57:41.768]  I'm frustrated here.
[00:57:42.668 --> 00:57:44.849]  I just said, sir, please cue it up.
[00:57:44.929 --> 00:57:45.769]  Please let me hear it.
[00:57:45.889 --> 00:57:46.570]  Mail it to me.
[00:57:46.970 --> 00:57:48.390]  You don't need to drive to Austin.
[00:57:48.590 --> 00:57:49.410]  I don't want to meet with you.
[00:57:49.991 --> 00:57:54.132]  I give you my word, sir, that if you'll make a copy of the tape,
[00:57:54.901 --> 00:58:01.143]  Put it in an envelope, mail it to me, and have a note in there that this is from Kevin in Alabama, and have it queued up to the spot.
[00:58:01.643 --> 00:58:06.405]  I will immediately put the DVD or the tape or whatever you've got in, and I will watch it.
[00:58:07.605 --> 00:58:07.965]  Okay?
[00:58:09.186 --> 00:58:11.927]  I mean, I don't know what to say to you.
[00:58:12.007 --> 00:58:13.407]  I don't know how to respond to you.
[00:58:15.188 --> 00:58:16.468]  And, you know, you've called before.
[00:58:16.968 --> 00:58:21.430]  We've had little controversies with you before where you say one thing and it's another.
[00:58:21.610 --> 00:58:22.930]  So there you go.
[00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:24.271]  You just keep making this claim.
[00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:33.907]  If he's still there, talk to him during the break and say just calmly to him, John, say, hey, Kevin, cue it up.
[00:58:33.947 --> 00:58:35.068]  Can we just hear the audio?
[00:58:35.708 --> 00:58:37.309]  Or he's so frustrating.
[00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:38.350]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:41.673 --> 00:58:46.316]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:58.179 --> 00:58:58.839]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:00.562]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.262 --> 00:59:02.384]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:03.025 --> 00:59:03.846]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.607 --> 00:59:05.388]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.141 --> 00:59:10.124]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.344 --> 00:59:14.486]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:27.955 --> 00:59:30.497]  Welcome back now into hour number two.
[00:59:30.657 --> 00:59:30.937]  U.S.
[00:59:30.977 --> 00:59:32.658]  plan for flu pandemic revealed.
[00:59:32.718 --> 00:59:33.759]  It's martial law.
[00:59:34.654 --> 00:59:38.459]  Newsweek headline, secret police in America.
[00:59:39.279 --> 00:59:42.383]  More generals going public saying Rumsfeld should resign.
[00:59:43.524 --> 00:59:43.845]  U.S.
[00:59:44.005 --> 00:59:45.446]  Army colonel says U.S.
[00:59:45.467 --> 00:59:47.469]  military operations already underway in Iran.
[00:59:47.489 --> 00:59:51.413]  A lot on exploding gold prices, silver prices, oil prices.
[00:59:51.934 --> 00:59:54.196]  It's all coming up in this hour.
[00:59:56.207 --> 01:00:04.572]  It was on Jimmy Kimmel Live Friday night and really hit a home run, bringing up 9-11, Building 7, the Pentagon, you name it.
[01:00:04.632 --> 01:00:07.814]  So we're going to air another clip of that coming up later in the shower.
[01:00:10.476 --> 01:00:14.858]  Kevin is on hold, and he started cussing, so I'm not going to be able to bring him back on air.
[01:00:15.498 --> 01:00:19.581]  And Kevin, in the future I'll let you call in, but if you do it one more time you're going to be banned from the show.
[01:00:21.074 --> 01:00:24.216]  And I'm going to try to talk to him during the break and find out exactly what he's saying.
[01:00:24.256 --> 01:00:31.079]  He called last week and said there was some show called Secret Societies on History Channel that shows a picture of Charlie Sheen.
[01:00:31.459 --> 01:00:32.720]  And I didn't understand that.
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:34.400]  We talked to him during the break.
[01:00:36.341 --> 01:00:39.683]  And I've made phone calls.
[01:00:39.723 --> 01:00:40.403]  I've talked to people.
[01:00:40.443 --> 01:00:42.064]  I've asked the listeners, have you seen this show?
[01:00:42.124 --> 01:00:42.724]  Is that on there?
[01:00:42.764 --> 01:00:43.685]  And they say, no, it's not.
[01:00:44.511 --> 01:00:47.612]  So there's no need for you to drive to Texas, sir, to bring me the tape.
[01:00:48.072 --> 01:00:50.392]  If you have the tape, make a copy of it, put it in an envelope.
[01:00:50.412 --> 01:00:58.854]  If you want to overnight it to me, I'll watch it tomorrow, or you can send it to me snail mail, and I'll get it in three or four or five days, six days, whatever.
[01:01:00.614 --> 01:01:01.994]  There's no need for you to challenge me.
[01:01:02.034 --> 01:01:04.174]  You'll come to Austin, and you'll show me.
[01:01:04.915 --> 01:01:12.616]  I was told what you were saying when they had you faded down, because I said the minute you got hot to fade you down, and I was a bleeper this, bleeper that, a CIA agent and all this stuff.
[01:01:13.593 --> 01:01:15.193]  Sir, I'm just asking you for the proof.
[01:01:15.714 --> 01:01:20.915]  Or to play the audio of what context you say it shows a photo of him at an Illuminati meeting.
[01:01:20.975 --> 01:01:29.898]  I mean, it's just so frustrating to try to be fair with people, to try to be nice, as nice as I can be, and to be yelled at and called names.
[01:01:31.238 --> 01:01:32.858]  Let's go ahead and go to David in California.
[01:01:32.898 --> 01:01:33.659]  David, you're on the air.
[01:01:33.699 --> 01:01:33.999]  Welcome.
[01:01:35.479 --> 01:01:36.900]  Hey, Alex.
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:37.620]  How are you doing?
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:38.040]  Good.
[01:01:38.922 --> 01:01:40.083]  Hey, I wanted to ask you a question.
[01:01:40.103 --> 01:01:43.365]  I think I've heard this gentleman's name on your show before.
[01:01:43.385 --> 01:01:50.709]  I got a bunch of his CDs from a church member the other day.
[01:01:51.309 --> 01:01:52.150]  Walter Weiss?
[01:01:53.851 --> 01:01:54.531]  No, I don't know him.
[01:01:55.312 --> 01:01:56.693]  You've never heard of Walter Weiss?
[01:01:57.233 --> 01:01:59.134]  No, I don't believe I have.
[01:01:59.975 --> 01:02:00.835]  Oh, that's a shame.
[01:02:00.855 --> 01:02:05.318]  I think you'd do well to have this man as a guest on your show.
[01:02:06.293 --> 01:02:07.633]  You can read more about him.
[01:02:07.693 --> 01:02:10.634]  I'm going to give you the website.
[01:02:10.894 --> 01:02:35.440]  He's a Seventh-day Adventist pastor, professor, who used to be involved heavily in the occult, was also Roman Catholic, and has turned in the last, oh, I'm going to guess 15, 20 years to being a true Sabbath keeper, being a Seventh-day Adventist.
[01:02:36.153 --> 01:02:42.799]  And this man, I've watched, I spent all day yesterday watching these CDs, basically.
[01:02:43.319 --> 01:02:49.904]  And this man hits home run after home run after home run talking about, you know, the Mark of the Beast.
[01:02:50.765 --> 01:03:02.475]  And, you know, just the fact of his knowledge of the secret signs, secret handshakes, secret everything with respect to the secret society is just amazing.
[01:03:02.555 --> 01:03:03.115]  I mean, it is...
[01:03:04.335 --> 01:03:10.218]  His website, again, is amazingdiscovery.org, I believe.
[01:03:10.738 --> 01:03:13.059]  I haven't taken a look at the website.
[01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:20.923]  I'm not suggesting that he's in competition with respect to your videos and so forth.
[01:03:22.323 --> 01:03:23.724]  Well, he was suggesting that.
[01:03:23.764 --> 01:03:26.405]  I think you just brought it up.
[01:03:27.146 --> 01:03:28.026]  Interesting call.
[01:03:28.126 --> 01:03:29.026]  I really appreciate it.
[01:03:29.086 --> 01:03:30.127]  I'll try to check it out, sir.
[01:03:31.668 --> 01:03:35.053]  We'll come back and take more of your calls and get into the news.
[01:03:35.153 --> 01:03:40.399]  In fact, I'll go through three or four more calls and I'll get into the news and then go back and forth with the calls and your news.
[01:03:42.021 --> 01:03:43.343]  So, stay with us.

[01:03:55.091 --> 01:03:57.933]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:58.193 --> 01:03:59.774]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:04:00.115 --> 01:04:04.798]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:05.138 --> 01:04:09.582]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:04:09.982 --> 01:04:14.185]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:14.385 --> 01:04:17.227]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:17.327 --> 01:04:19.829]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks...

[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:49.382]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:05:49.422 --> 01:05:51.203]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:06:01.383 --> 01:06:09.269]  The best-kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:06:09.489 --> 01:06:12.132]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed, Inc.'
[01:06:12.112 --> 01:06:13.533]  's patented methodology.
[01:06:13.693 --> 01:06:20.638]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy tumors of any size without adverse side effects.
[01:06:20.878 --> 01:06:23.861]  At a physician's office, Star Wars technology at its best.
[01:06:24.221 --> 01:06:24.722]  We're good to go.
[01:06:24.762 --> 01:06:25.102]  I think?
[01:06:53.522 --> 01:06:53.822]  We're good.
[01:07:21.886 --> 01:07:24.127]  We're about eight minutes into this second hour.
[01:07:24.147 --> 01:07:37.090]  I'm going to take your phone calls and I'll get into a lot of really important news that we haven't covered yet today concerning the economy, concerning the upcoming attack on Iran, the police state in America, the bird flu, you name it.
[01:07:38.310 --> 01:07:41.271]  Right now, let's go to Sue in Texas.
[01:07:41.351 --> 01:07:42.991]  Sue, thanks for holding your on the air.
[01:07:44.631 --> 01:07:44.872]  Hi.
[01:07:45.992 --> 01:07:46.492]  Talk to you.
[01:07:47.125 --> 01:08:03.429]  I live in Houston, Texas and I first heard you on Coast to Coast one night and I really found you wonderful and exciting and I'm very proud of you for your courage and coming out with all these issues.
[01:08:04.189 --> 01:08:05.290]  I have a couple questions.
[01:08:05.350 --> 01:08:10.511]  I've been buying books from you and tapes and passing it all around to my friends and
[01:08:11.315 --> 01:08:13.916]  Asking people, do you know who the Bilderbergs are?
[01:08:13.936 --> 01:08:24.681]  Because I listened to your discussion with Jim Tucker, and that was fascinating, and I've been trying to follow up with that and letting people know about that.
[01:08:26.041 --> 01:08:27.102]  But my question is this.
[01:08:27.742 --> 01:08:34.925]  In order to listen to you here in Houston, I had to buy a special satellite dish because I don't have time to sit by the computer, you know?
[01:08:35.605 --> 01:08:39.547]  And I'm wondering, are you going to be able to be on the local radio
[01:08:40.209 --> 01:08:45.911]  Radio broadcasting here for the vast audience here in Houston?
[01:08:46.291 --> 01:08:49.912]  Well, you know, that's the $64 million question.
[01:08:50.132 --> 01:08:51.513]  We have a lot of affiliates.
[01:08:51.653 --> 01:08:56.155]  I mean, I think Genesis Total, with all its shows together, has over 300 affiliates.
[01:08:56.275 --> 01:09:00.896]  One show might have 20, one might have 85, one might have 30 or 40.
[01:09:02.277 --> 01:09:05.698]  But there's 14,000 radio stations plus in this country.
[01:09:06.158 --> 01:09:08.859]  A couple thousand of those are talk or partial talk.
[01:09:09.811 --> 01:09:22.361]  And, you know, we reach millions of people, but most of the stations are owned by big conglomerates that don't even put on other conglomerates news or programs.
[01:09:22.381 --> 01:09:27.125]  They even produce their own programs to kind of have a monopoly of information and profits.
[01:09:27.946 --> 01:09:31.369]  And I'm sure you've heard of the names, the Claire Channels, the Viacom, CBS.
[01:09:31.389 --> 01:09:33.831]  But you know what?
[01:09:33.871 --> 01:09:36.953]  Here in Houston, we have that fellow, Ed Schultz.
[01:09:38.959 --> 01:09:41.661]  He's a Democrat, and he's on at 9 o'clock at night.
[01:09:41.961 --> 01:09:43.923]  Yeah, but I mean, I've heard that.
[01:09:44.083 --> 01:09:45.624]  He covers a fraction of what I do.
[01:09:46.024 --> 01:09:48.566]  Well, I know that, but I mean, I wish they'd...
[01:09:49.986 --> 01:09:52.347]  Cut him in half and at least give you half of that time.
[01:09:52.747 --> 01:09:57.769]  But anyway, let me get to a couple of points that have been on my mind since I've been looking at the page.
[01:09:57.789 --> 01:09:59.249]  Okay, I thought you were asking me a question.
[01:09:59.330 --> 01:09:59.570]  Okay.
[01:09:59.770 --> 01:10:00.310]  I'm sorry.
[01:10:00.690 --> 01:10:01.050]  No, no, no.
[01:10:01.090 --> 01:10:02.111]  I mean, I'm sorry to interrupt you.
[01:10:02.131 --> 01:10:04.191]  I thought that was a question about stations.
[01:10:04.251 --> 01:10:04.952]  But go ahead.
[01:10:04.972 --> 01:10:10.594]  Well, that was because I really want to tell people that they could turn on the station and get you, but I know that they can't.
[01:10:10.714 --> 01:10:14.235]  So I get you because of that satellite that I bought.
[01:10:15.796 --> 01:10:16.876]  But my question is this.
[01:10:17.096 --> 01:10:19.257]  On that video, Loose Change...
[01:10:19.918 --> 01:10:26.940]  Remember at the end of the portion about the gold that they got out of the World Trade Center?
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.801]  Yeah, there really was gold in the building and we're not supposed to talk about it.
[01:10:30.241 --> 01:10:36.703]  And I've never heard any discussion about that anywhere as to why it was there and where it went.
[01:10:38.012 --> 01:10:40.693]  That's because the government says they're not going to answer questions about it.
[01:10:41.213 --> 01:10:41.633]  I see.
[01:10:41.933 --> 01:10:42.273]  I see.
[01:10:42.293 --> 01:10:43.694]  So you don't know anything else about it.
[01:10:44.334 --> 01:10:49.275]  Well, no, we know there was a bunch of gold reserves in the building, and they won't discuss where they are or what happened to them.
[01:10:49.595 --> 01:10:49.875]  Yeah.
[01:10:50.216 --> 01:10:54.497]  And, of course, the implication is that it was put into the trucks in advance.
[01:10:54.877 --> 01:10:58.458]  Well, yeah, they found a truck that had gotten blocked off in a collapse just full of gold.
[01:10:59.338 --> 01:10:59.598]  Yeah.
[01:11:00.399 --> 01:11:01.199]  Another question.
[01:11:01.739 --> 01:11:05.340]  On that Flight 77, supposedly, that went into the Pentagon...
[01:11:06.363 --> 01:11:09.528]  Wasn't Barbara Olsen the wife of Ted Olsen on that plane?
[01:11:10.289 --> 01:11:11.931]  I believe so, yes, supposedly.
[01:11:12.152 --> 01:11:13.513]  Well, what happened to that?
[01:11:13.554 --> 01:11:16.858]  What do they speculate happened to that plane?
[01:11:17.499 --> 01:11:17.820]  Well, she...
[01:11:18.638 --> 01:11:20.619]  You know, I carry Loose Change 2nd Edition.
[01:11:20.639 --> 01:11:21.259]  I sell it.
[01:11:21.279 --> 01:11:22.159]  I think it's a great film.
[01:11:22.299 --> 01:11:23.720]  Yeah, I bought it from you.
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:28.061]  Yeah, but my point is, if you watch my films, I don't address any of that.
[01:11:28.321 --> 01:11:29.462]  Those are the hot issues.
[01:11:29.822 --> 01:11:30.982]  People love a mystery.
[01:11:33.043 --> 01:11:35.003]  We don't have to answer what happened.
[01:11:35.043 --> 01:11:42.886]  We have to answer, the government has to answer why at every step of the way, their official story, Sue, isn't true.
[01:11:43.427 --> 01:11:44.129]  Right.
[01:11:44.169 --> 01:11:45.653]  So we know they're lying.
[01:11:45.713 --> 01:11:48.020]  We know they warned public officials not to fly.
[01:11:48.341 --> 01:11:50.106]  We know NORAD stood down.
[01:11:50.965 --> 01:11:51.085]  Yeah.
[01:11:51.125 --> 01:11:51.205]  Yeah.
[01:12:17.305 --> 01:12:23.771]  And so what I do is what others really haven't done, is I address all the things we can prove.
[01:12:24.832 --> 01:12:27.014]  And it's very effective at waking people up.
[01:12:27.054 --> 01:12:33.280]  But if we get caught up in exactly how the government ran the attacks, we'll be debating that until the end of time.
[01:12:34.781 --> 01:12:35.101]  I know.
[01:12:35.161 --> 01:12:36.382]  Well, I just saw Loose Change.
[01:12:36.422 --> 01:12:37.764]  I watched it again last night.
[01:12:37.824 --> 01:12:41.427]  And remember they talked about the plane that went to Cincinnati yesterday.
[01:12:42.265 --> 01:12:45.406]  Yeah, the governor reported that the Flight 93 landed there.
[01:12:45.426 --> 01:12:49.767]  Right, and then he actually said that that plane is still working.
[01:12:50.187 --> 01:12:51.487]  It's still a working plane.
[01:12:51.967 --> 01:12:53.708]  It's never shot down or anything.
[01:12:54.128 --> 01:12:54.908]  Remember that?
[01:12:55.108 --> 01:13:02.470]  Yes, and then you had all four planes with 20.1% occupancy, with 85% plus occupancy on the East Coast that day.
[01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:05.210]  Magically computer malfunctions in two different companies.
[01:13:05.490 --> 01:13:08.951]  We have insider trading by CIA connected with a former deputy director.
[01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:09.651]  I know it does.
[01:13:30.322 --> 01:13:31.563]  Well, I want to tell you one thing.
[01:13:31.663 --> 01:13:41.068]  My mother lives in New York, and when I called her that day, and she said to me, my mom was at that time about 81 years old, and she said, Sue, that's an inside job.
[01:13:41.709 --> 01:13:42.109]  Really?
[01:13:42.349 --> 01:13:42.949]  Yes, she did.
[01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:45.071]  And I said, oh, Mom, it couldn't be.
[01:13:45.171 --> 01:13:47.832]  And she said, oh, yes, they want to make a war, she said.
[01:13:48.933 --> 01:13:50.094]  Well, your mom knows.
[01:13:50.134 --> 01:13:51.234]  The old-timers know.
[01:13:51.414 --> 01:13:51.835]  They do.
[01:13:52.115 --> 01:13:53.235]  Hey, Sue, good to hear from you.
[01:13:53.796 --> 01:13:54.916]  I appreciate your call.
[01:13:56.197 --> 01:13:58.278]  I mean, those are the issues we never talk about anymore.
[01:13:58.398 --> 01:13:59.499]  The Saudis being flown out.
[01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:06.545]  Larry King Live had Bandar Bush, you know, what's his nickname, the Saudi ambassador to the U.S.
[01:14:06.905 --> 01:14:10.648]  on there saying, none of it's true, it's all made up, they didn't fly them in live themselves.
[01:14:11.729 --> 01:14:14.612]  They flew them out the day of the attack, the next day, the next day.
[01:14:15.212 --> 01:14:26.041]  There were multiple flights, and the media tries to get deceptive and go, no, there was a flight five days later when the flying restrictions had been lifted, and they have a fake debate about that.
[01:14:26.792 --> 01:14:28.393]  And go, see, Alex is lying.
[01:14:28.933 --> 01:14:31.314]  They flew him out five days later.
[01:14:31.454 --> 01:14:33.595]  No, there were multiple flights.
[01:14:34.555 --> 01:14:39.297]  Miami Herald, Associated Press, local newscasts.
[01:14:39.457 --> 01:14:40.397]  It's admitted.
[01:14:40.457 --> 01:14:43.218]  But see, they're so deceptive.
[01:14:43.238 --> 01:14:45.279]  They know the average person doesn't check fax out.
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:49.280]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:50.401]  Let's talk to Peter.
[01:14:51.261 --> 01:14:53.402]  Peter, where are you calling us from?
[01:14:55.163 --> 01:14:55.403]  Alex?
[01:14:55.803 --> 01:14:56.003]  Yes.
[01:14:56.687 --> 01:14:57.308]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:14:57.488 --> 01:14:58.769]  Where are you calling us from, Peter?
[01:14:59.129 --> 01:14:59.609]  Missouri.
[01:14:59.810 --> 01:15:00.170]  Welcome.
[01:15:01.511 --> 01:15:06.715]  Alex, I wanted to call your attention to a very important story.
[01:15:06.795 --> 01:15:11.059]  It's been quietly brewing in the background for some time, getting no coverage whatsoever.
[01:15:11.079 --> 01:15:15.783]  Have you heard of the David Carmichael case out in Virginia?
[01:15:17.344 --> 01:15:18.705]  Why don't you refresh my memory?
[01:15:19.926 --> 01:15:20.867]  Dave Carmichael...
[01:15:21.593 --> 01:15:39.501]  Was a chief petty officer in the Navy, had spent about 16 years in, and had, from a religious conviction, decided to divest himself of a social security number, which he believed was the number of the beast.
[01:15:40.541 --> 01:15:43.663]  And the Navy refused to make a religious accommodation, and...
[01:15:46.912 --> 01:16:01.020]  He fought the Navy for something like eight years in court, finally prevailed, and had a huge check for back pay and what would be his pension, because he would have done the 20 years.
[01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:13.026]  And having prevailed and gotten a settlement from the government, now he can't find a bank that's willing to cash this huge check
[01:16:13.587 --> 01:16:15.869]  Without him providing a social security number.
[01:16:15.909 --> 01:16:24.094]  They won't open an account for him in spite of the fact that there is no law that requires anybody to have that number.
[01:16:24.555 --> 01:16:27.136]  Well, in fact, there's not just not a law.
[01:16:27.657 --> 01:16:33.441]  There is the Privacy Act of 86 saying, what, it's a felony if someone makes you use that?
[01:16:34.481 --> 01:16:37.844]  So, I mean, it's just all criminal, sir.
[01:16:38.544 --> 01:16:42.707]  I agree, but see, the thing is, Dave Carmichael...
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:17:06.119]  has made some great advances and he's also working with this other fellow up in Idaho who is challenging the state of Idaho on issuance of a driver's license without a social security number and there's a case of a crop duster down in Texas
[01:17:08.467 --> 01:17:13.330]  Where the Attorney General is trying to prevent him from... Yeah, I'm familiar with those reports, yes.
[01:17:13.571 --> 01:17:32.002]  Okay, well, the thing is that there have been some really good developments with the Idaho case, and Dave Carmichael's case, he has a beautiful case set up against, I believe, Bank of America now that just needs to go forward.
[01:17:32.848 --> 01:17:35.689]  And I've spoken to him personally a number of times.
[01:17:35.709 --> 01:17:36.869]  He's a great guy.
[01:17:36.889 --> 01:17:45.752]  A lot of people were holding him up on prayer with the final court trials in the Navy case.
[01:17:45.812 --> 01:17:46.592]  We're about to go to break.
[01:17:47.312 --> 01:17:47.572]  Hello?
[01:17:47.972 --> 01:17:48.832]  We're about to go to break.
[01:17:48.852 --> 01:17:49.273]  Just finish up.
[01:17:49.813 --> 01:17:50.233]  Okay.
[01:17:50.793 --> 01:17:53.934]  I wanted to give your people his number off the air.
[01:17:54.094 --> 01:17:55.814]  I think he's worthy of an interview.
[01:17:56.014 --> 01:17:56.194]  Okay.
[01:17:56.214 --> 01:17:57.495]  We'll put you on hold and try to get that.
[01:17:57.955 --> 01:18:00.035]  Let me just say this about Social Security.
[01:18:00.976 --> 01:18:01.996]  Well, I'll do it after the break.
[01:18:03.548 --> 01:18:04.629]  I am all for fighting it.
[01:18:05.249 --> 01:18:06.030]  It is a fraud.
[01:18:06.090 --> 01:18:06.710]  It is wrong.
[01:18:06.750 --> 01:18:09.792]  It is a control, taxation, tracking, grid number.
[01:18:12.073 --> 01:18:17.036]  The problem is people win these cases all the time because it is illegal to make you do this.
[01:18:17.296 --> 01:18:20.878]  But the government and the corporations still just continue to enforce it.
[01:18:20.958 --> 01:18:31.124]  It's like there have been hundreds and hundreds of cases at state, federal, local level with failure to ID where you can prove that you cannot be made to have an ID on you and made to answer questions.
[01:18:31.925 --> 01:18:32.365]  But still...
[01:18:33.672 --> 01:18:38.657]  For the one person that defeats it in court, thousands of people go to jail and don't fight it.
[01:18:39.758 --> 01:18:42.220]  Proving again the government's engaging in criminal activities.
[01:18:43.941 --> 01:18:47.224]  I mean, examples of this, well, I'll get into it after the break.
[01:18:47.524 --> 01:18:48.946]  We'll take more calls and get into the news.
[01:18:49.546 --> 01:18:49.947]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.829 --> 01:18:57.311]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:18:57.571 --> 01:19:01.073]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:19:01.173 --> 01:19:05.115]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:19:05.335 --> 01:19:11.498]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:19:11.899 --> 01:19:19.803]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:19:20.203 --> 01:19:20.604]  We're good to go.
[01:19:35.143 --> 01:19:35.703]  Here it is, folks.
[01:19:35.723 --> 01:19:36.124]  The 2006 Red Book.
[01:19:36.144 --> 01:19:37.725]  The most comprehensive edition ever published.

[01:20:15.211 --> 01:20:16.712]  They are instruments of debt.
[01:20:16.992 --> 01:20:19.052]  Feel the comfort and safety of real money.

[01:23:08.672 --> 01:23:11.492]  Remember to join us, 800-259-9231.
[01:23:11.512 --> 01:23:16.374]  I'm going to just start covering the news right now, since this is a short segment.
[01:23:16.394 --> 01:23:17.514]  Let me get into this first.
[01:23:18.094 --> 01:23:19.835]  This is out of the Los Angeles Times.
[01:23:21.275 --> 01:23:23.836]  Campus lockdown appalls parents.
[01:23:24.376 --> 01:23:28.537]  Some students at Englewood Elementary School were barred from using the restroom.
[01:23:30.813 --> 01:23:42.460]  As students from neighboring secondary schools walked out of class recently to protest immigration legislation, one Englewood elementary school imposed a lockdown so severe that some students were barred from using the restroom.
[01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:47.763]  Instead, they used buckets placed in classroom corners or behind teachers' desks.
[01:23:47.783 --> 01:23:49.344]  This is all just mind control.
[01:23:50.405 --> 01:23:52.426]  The schools are prisons, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:53.126 --> 01:23:54.487]  Appalled by the school's action...
[01:23:55.265 --> 01:24:00.487]  Worthington Elementary School parents have complained to the school board and plan to attend another board meeting next week.
[01:24:00.507 --> 01:24:03.469]  What about pulling your kids out of these government indoctrination centers?
[01:24:03.989 --> 01:24:12.673]  Principal Angie Marquez imposed a lockdown March 27th when nearly 40,000 middle and high school students across Southern California staged walkouts.
[01:24:12.713 --> 01:24:15.194]  Again, everyone's being treated as if they're criminals.
[01:24:16.674 --> 01:24:17.895]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[01:24:18.519 --> 01:24:27.385]  But Marquez, who did not return calls for comment, apparently misread the district handbook and ordered the most restrictive lockdown, one reserved for nuclear attacks.
[01:24:29.187 --> 01:24:32.269]  Again, that you're not allowed to leave the classroom and you have to defecate and urinate in the class.
[01:24:32.990 --> 01:24:41.516]  Tim Brown, Director of Operations for the Englewood Unified School District, confirmed that some students were forced to use buckets, but said the principal's order was an honest mistake.
[01:24:42.056 --> 01:24:43.017]  Now, I want to stop right there.
[01:24:44.665 --> 01:24:50.149]  This shows a criminally insane level of disconnect, of mindlessness.
[01:24:52.892 --> 01:25:04.341]  All over the country, they make adults thumb scan, face scan, and swipe cards to get into the school, right here in Austin, in the Westlake School District, the wealthy school district.
[01:25:05.922 --> 01:25:09.385]  They are now putting this in, what do they call it, Eames School District.
[01:25:10.426 --> 01:25:11.347]  I believe that's the name of it.
[01:25:11.907 --> 01:25:12.928]  I'll be corrected if it's not.
[01:25:13.562 --> 01:25:14.662]  My listeners here in Austin.
[01:25:16.763 --> 01:25:21.404]  And they're putting fences up around schools all over the country.
[01:25:22.044 --> 01:25:23.665]  They frisk the children.
[01:25:23.965 --> 01:25:35.388]  They have drug dogs come in and the children, before the start of the first period, of course you've seen Goose Creek, North Carolina, the famous case of the dogs, grabbing and savaging and ripping open bags off children's backs as they cry.
[01:25:35.708 --> 01:25:41.130]  They have drills where they aim machine guns at them and scream and yell and say it's for your own good, traumatizing them.
[01:25:41.170 --> 01:25:41.950]  It's just mind control.
[01:25:43.237 --> 01:25:43.738]  We're good to go.
[01:25:43.758 --> 01:25:43.938]  I think?
[01:26:04.128 --> 01:26:07.072]  Is seen by a security guard with a bag, and he says, what's in that?
[01:26:07.112 --> 01:26:08.474]  I'm going to search it because you're a prisoner.
[01:26:08.715 --> 01:26:09.275]  It's a prison.
[01:26:09.816 --> 01:26:12.540]  A minimum security prison for now is about what most schools are at.
[01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:17.327]  And he searches and finds the cake and a little box of Dixie forks and knives.
[01:26:17.367 --> 01:26:19.630]  You buy those at 7-Eleven or at the Safeway.
[01:26:21.435 --> 01:26:23.256]  And they go, it's zero tolerance.
[01:26:23.396 --> 01:26:24.536]  We have to enforce this.
[01:26:24.576 --> 01:26:25.697]  We don't have any leeway.
[01:26:26.217 --> 01:26:28.718]  See, it makes the teachers and administrators drones.
[01:26:28.758 --> 01:26:29.758]  They have no leeway themselves.
[01:26:30.318 --> 01:26:36.461]  We are going to suspend you for the semester and revoke your diploma.
[01:26:36.481 --> 01:26:41.082]  You've got to go to summer school now, and you won't be able to go to college in the summer like you were planning.
[01:26:41.963 --> 01:26:47.265]  You've all heard of the famous cases where it's always top of the class or salutatory and valedictorian.
[01:26:47.285 --> 01:26:48.125]  We've interviewed a bunch of them.
[01:26:49.873 --> 01:26:52.415]  Where they're moving out the last day of school.
[01:26:52.435 --> 01:26:54.136]  For some reason, it's always the last day of school.
[01:26:55.136 --> 01:26:58.959]  They've got a new set of silverware their parents have bought them.
[01:26:58.979 --> 01:27:01.901]  You buy it in a cardboard box with the open face and the plastic.
[01:27:03.101 --> 01:27:05.843]  There's dull butter knives, but they have a serrated edge.
[01:27:06.403 --> 01:27:08.465]  So they arrest the young lady.
[01:27:09.165 --> 01:27:15.946]  Or a young man is top of his class, he's in the 10th grade, and for art class they say, paint a picture of your parents.
[01:27:15.986 --> 01:27:26.388]  He paints his dad, who's a Marine Corps captain, this happened, what, three years ago, I interviewed him, in Iraq, and he is arrested and kicked out of school, has to go to psychological training.
[01:27:26.748 --> 01:27:35.110]  The case last week, it was in the Rocky Mountain News, where it openly said, he didn't violate a law, his dad's a gun enthusiast, they're allowed to have guns in the home, they took pictures with their rifles.
[01:27:35.470 --> 01:27:39.871]  It was posted on MySpace, nothing threatening, going, here's my rifle, in a gun forum area.
[01:27:40.291 --> 01:27:49.734]  And so the police came and arrested him, and he's been in jail for two months, and he's been convicted, and the judge says there's no law, but I'm saying that you're now going to spend a year in jail.
[01:27:51.575 --> 01:27:53.455]  And then after that, you'll have psychological testing.
[01:27:54.035 --> 01:28:02.838]  Or the case last week where they arrested two people, didn't even charge them for drugs, and were taking them to the dentist to have their gold teeth removed, their gold crowns removed,
[01:28:03.877 --> 01:28:07.778]  No judge, no jury, no indictment, just when we get you in custody, we rip your teeth out.
[01:28:09.879 --> 01:28:11.679]  Which is what it is, basically, to take somebody's crowns.
[01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:21.762]  So, again, in Austin, Texas, they go in hotels, they see someone drink three drinks in an hour, they're arrested.
[01:28:22.362 --> 01:28:31.845]  It's just total police state, wild and crazy, just out there feeding on us, and now you've got to defecate in a bucket.
[01:28:32.890 --> 01:28:33.731]  And that's in the article.
[01:28:34.151 --> 01:28:38.253]  Imagine children squatting in the class, defecating.
[01:28:38.934 --> 01:28:39.574]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:44.197 --> 01:28:45.097]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.578 --> 01:28:47.159]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.179 --> 01:28:50.801]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.614 --> 01:29:00.957]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:01.177 --> 01:29:06.199]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[01:29:06.519 --> 01:29:14.423]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:14.583 --> 01:29:21.626]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:21.846 --> 01:29:23.047]  There are no side effects.
[01:29:23.207 --> 01:29:26.590]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:29:26.650 --> 01:29:27.771]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:29:28.051 --> 01:29:29.332]  Eliminate the cause.
[01:29:29.532 --> 01:29:36.357]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:29:36.477 --> 01:29:38.939]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[01:30:46.738 --> 01:30:49.486]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:55.680]  Come on, Bill.
[01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:57.722]  Two weeks ago, you were riding the bicycle.
[01:30:57.902 --> 01:31:01.064]  And today, you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[01:31:01.404 --> 01:31:01.965]  What did you do?
[01:31:02.085 --> 01:31:02.885]  Rob Bill Gates?
[01:31:02.985 --> 01:31:04.967]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[01:31:05.247 --> 01:31:10.771]  What I did do is visit the website www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[01:31:11.051 --> 01:31:17.316]  That's where I learned how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[01:31:17.656 --> 01:31:19.858]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[01:31:20.158 --> 01:31:23.020]  And get this, they guarantee my success in writing.
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:26.963]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week.
[01:31:27.203 --> 01:31:27.623]  Whoa.
[01:31:28.003 --> 01:31:29.204]  What was that website again?
[01:31:29.284 --> 01:31:32.767]  It's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[01:31:33.087 --> 01:31:34.208]  Now write this down, John.
[01:31:34.328 --> 01:31:38.631]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[01:31:38.771 --> 01:31:39.351]  Thanks, Bill.
[01:31:39.631 --> 01:31:40.832]  I'm going there right now.
[01:31:41.232 --> 01:31:41.873]  Check, please.
[01:31:43.637 --> 01:31:45.118]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[01:31:45.598 --> 01:31:46.198]  Sure, John.
[01:31:46.418 --> 01:31:50.779]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:51.079 --> 01:31:52.780]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:53.300]  Deal.
[01:31:54.120 --> 01:32:01.222]  Now, these school administrators, under these martial law handbooks that they have, aren't thinking.
[01:32:01.242 --> 01:32:03.143]  They're just following orders.
[01:32:12.552 --> 01:32:15.694]  And that's what a high-tech, brainwashed police state is about.
[01:32:16.434 --> 01:32:22.078]  That's why for over 15 years they've had death education in hundreds and hundreds of school districts we've read about.
[01:32:23.058 --> 01:32:35.025]  I don't know the actual numbers, but I've seen hundreds of reports where they have the elementary students in 5th grade and 4th grade get in coffins, they seal the coffins, they talk about death, claiming that that keeps them from committing suicide.
[01:32:35.658 --> 01:32:40.381]  Since they implemented this Jim Jones brainwashing, suicide, of course, has exploded.
[01:32:40.441 --> 01:32:44.063]  Because you start teaching kids about suicide, they've never even thought about it, folks.
[01:32:44.283 --> 01:32:45.884]  It's like, quote, sex education.
[01:32:46.264 --> 01:32:49.886]  Heather has two mommies, you know, Daddy and Steve, or whatever.
[01:32:50.266 --> 01:32:57.890]  Then that introduces it to the children, and all the statistics show actually increases promiscuity and then leading alternative lifestyles.
[01:32:58.191 --> 01:33:01.272]  I mean, these children should be thinking about innocent things.
[01:33:01.312 --> 01:33:04.074]  They should be learning about firemen and police and...
[01:33:04.924 --> 01:33:16.915]  And, you know, blue whales and mathematics and Bunsen burners and the galaxies and the Hubble Space Telescope.
[01:33:17.235 --> 01:33:19.557]  They should be learning and having their minds challenged.
[01:33:19.577 --> 01:33:22.960]  They should be learning about the founding fathers and world history.
[01:33:23.020 --> 01:33:28.725]  But no, they learn how to be frisked and they learn how to thumb scan to get their school lunches and thumb scan to get...
[01:33:29.489 --> 01:33:30.250]  Library books.
[01:33:30.610 --> 01:33:31.811]  They learn how to be searched.
[01:33:31.831 --> 01:33:33.573]  They learn how to have cameras in the bathrooms.
[01:33:33.633 --> 01:33:36.135]  Every week I see articles where they have cameras in the stalls.
[01:33:37.556 --> 01:33:43.161]  Hooked into the police department, and it turns out that the police are caught downloading it in foreign states and putting it on the web.
[01:33:43.321 --> 01:33:44.322]  That's Associated Press.
[01:33:45.003 --> 01:33:46.264]  Just craziness.
[01:33:46.324 --> 01:33:49.427]  Just basic, total nuttiness.
[01:33:49.547 --> 01:33:50.768]  But it's not nutty.
[01:33:50.808 --> 01:33:52.089]  It's nutty to normal people.
[01:33:52.189 --> 01:33:54.291]  But when you look at the reasons for it,
[01:33:55.001 --> 01:34:04.964]  If the government can have schools implement kids in coffins, and kids being frisked, and kids having police screaming, aiming guns at them, and quote, safety drills, being traumatized.
[01:34:05.724 --> 01:34:06.765]  I mean, that's terrorism.
[01:34:06.805 --> 01:34:12.686]  If an average person went and grabbed a kid, and aimed guns at them, and screamed at them, I mean, you'd go to prison for ten years, and you should.
[01:34:13.727 --> 01:34:20.489]  But the cops are told to do it, because this is the federally funded training manual, and the cops go and do it, again, conditioning you.
[01:34:20.509 --> 01:34:21.509]  Because if you can make kids...
[01:34:22.896 --> 01:34:24.198]  Go to the bathroom in buckets.
[01:34:24.758 --> 01:34:29.864]  Oh, and by the way, they told the children, because something dangerous is happening outside, the children got scared.
[01:34:30.485 --> 01:34:32.267]  See, it's traumatizing them.
[01:34:33.288 --> 01:34:35.311]  And of course, it's an elementary school.
[01:34:36.812 --> 01:34:38.094]  Englewood Elementary.
[01:34:39.095 --> 01:34:41.518]  You see, they do it when they're really young.
[01:34:43.334 --> 01:34:53.022]  And now they have full-time Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine recruiters in many of the schools, literally, quote, developing relationships with children over multiple years to get them recruited in.
[01:34:54.564 --> 01:34:56.305]  They now have police in the schools.
[01:34:56.325 --> 01:34:57.606]  This is in my film, The Takeover.
[01:34:57.987 --> 01:35:10.858]  All over the country, BATF will fund one to two deputies per middle school, seventh to eighth grade, where they have semester classes, seventh and eighth grade, a full year or a full nine months.
[01:35:12.071 --> 01:35:19.735]  But a full school year, total in two years, of having the BATF curriculum taught to them, and we got a copy of it.
[01:35:19.775 --> 01:35:20.595]  It's in my film.
[01:35:20.955 --> 01:35:22.056]  This was in a local paper.
[01:35:22.436 --> 01:35:23.877]  In that case, where was that?
[01:35:24.217 --> 01:35:26.058]  When we first broke it, it was Kentucky.
[01:35:27.519 --> 01:35:30.340]  And they ask them, the children write daily essays.
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:32.221]  What's in your parents' medicine cabinet?
[01:35:32.641 --> 01:35:34.082]  What type of guns do they own?
[01:35:34.102 --> 01:35:35.362]  They teach them how to be snitches.
[01:35:35.402 --> 01:35:37.163]  They give them little tattletale cards.
[01:35:37.203 --> 01:35:38.404]  We show it happening in Austin.
[01:35:39.315 --> 01:35:41.536]  Again, total Soviet society.
[01:35:41.877 --> 01:35:49.941]  And adults are watching the ball games and going to church or going fishing and the kids come home and then the mom gets home at 6, dad gets home at 6.30.
[01:35:52.878 --> 01:35:54.538]  The kids are in there playing violent video games.
[01:35:54.558 --> 01:35:55.879]  They're watching MTV.
[01:35:56.399 --> 01:35:57.539]  They've been brainwashed all day.
[01:35:57.599 --> 01:36:00.260]  The parents are watching the baseball or football game on television.
[01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:04.661]  They might eat dinner around the coffee table in the living room.
[01:36:04.721 --> 01:36:08.081]  And then Dad says he's going to play poker.
[01:36:08.602 --> 01:36:10.542]  Mom's going to go get on the treadmill.
[01:36:10.922 --> 01:36:13.163]  And the kids go out back and smoke pot.
[01:36:13.223 --> 01:36:14.703]  And the next month it'll be cocaine.
[01:36:16.081 --> 01:36:17.202]  I mean, that's America.
[01:36:17.722 --> 01:36:24.086]  The parents have no idea that stuff that makes Soviet brainwashing camps look tame.
[01:36:24.126 --> 01:36:26.707]  Because in a Soviet brainwashing camp, you know you're in a camp.
[01:36:26.767 --> 01:36:28.048]  You know you're being brainwashed.
[01:36:28.468 --> 01:36:29.929]  You know you're being traumatized.
[01:36:30.569 --> 01:36:34.812]  But America itself has been turned into a giant camp.
[01:36:37.613 --> 01:36:39.935]  And the parents have no idea even what's going on.
[01:36:40.075 --> 01:36:43.517]  I mean, the things I'm listing here are all going on in Austin, Texas.
[01:36:44.716 --> 01:36:49.579]  I don't have to go outside even where I live to witness it happening.
[01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:52.381]  Fake nuclear spills shutting down the highway.
[01:36:52.681 --> 01:36:54.362]  Fake bioattacks downtown.
[01:36:55.103 --> 01:36:56.244]  Police checkpoints.
[01:36:57.284 --> 01:37:03.028]  Cops going in even hotel bars with people registered there who drink three glasses of wine and they arrest them.
[01:37:03.849 --> 01:37:04.849]  That's America.
[01:37:04.929 --> 01:37:11.834]  Just the extreme craziness to set the precedent so if you'll accept that, you'll accept anything.
[01:37:13.268 --> 01:37:17.610]  Why do you think Bush has Alberto Gonzalez come out in memos and say they can torture children?
[01:37:18.230 --> 01:37:23.793]  And then John Yoo, one of their other counsels at the White House comes out and says we can even sexually torture them in front of their parents.
[01:37:23.833 --> 01:37:26.515]  I mean, why would they go so far in public?
[01:37:27.455 --> 01:37:31.737]  Because if they can get you to accept that, man, there's no more bottom left.
[01:37:31.777 --> 01:37:33.138]  I mean, we've fallen into hell.
[01:37:35.839 --> 01:37:39.741]  They're following psychological warfare manuals.
[01:37:43.416 --> 01:37:49.664]  To just condition the public to accept wilder and wilder and crazier and crazier things.
[01:37:52.889 --> 01:37:55.152]  Now remember the Model State Health Emergency Powers Act.
[01:37:55.212 --> 01:37:56.754]  I'm going to shift gears back into the other news now.
[01:37:59.778 --> 01:38:00.459]  And they ordered $14 million...
[01:38:02.711 --> 01:38:03.832]  It was almost 14 million.
[01:38:04.532 --> 01:38:05.132]  13 plus million.
[01:38:05.533 --> 01:38:12.216]  First responders, nurses, doctors, state employees, federal employees, firemen, police, FBI, everybody.
[01:38:12.856 --> 01:38:13.337]  13 plus million.
[01:38:14.317 --> 01:38:15.018]  Just shot 14.
[01:38:16.338 --> 01:38:19.300]  I was looking up that statistic again the other day, and I was wrong saying 14.
[01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:20.301]  It's 13 plus million.
[01:38:21.381 --> 01:38:24.823]  And 99 plus percent, according to the LA Times, refused to take it.
[01:38:25.402 --> 01:38:26.442]  What do they know we don't know?
[01:38:26.462 --> 01:38:28.023]  Well, it's just their gut-level instinct.
[01:38:28.043 --> 01:38:36.425]  Plus, all these doctors went public and said this smallpox inoculation doesn't protect you against weaponized smallpox, and it will spread actual smallpox in the population, guaranteed.
[01:38:37.366 --> 01:38:41.087]  And then a bunch of people took it, and the thousands that did, a lot of them had heart attacks and died.
[01:38:41.127 --> 01:38:44.668]  Remember when Tommy Thompson went from saying he must take it to saying, I never said take it.
[01:38:44.708 --> 01:38:45.128]  Remember that?
[01:38:47.129 --> 01:38:51.870]  They're constantly readjusting the propaganda, lying, changing stories day to day as if you're a bunch of idiots.
[01:38:53.519 --> 01:38:56.761]  Then we're told we're going to be hit by smallpox, we're going to have martial law for your own good.
[01:38:56.781 --> 01:38:57.922]  Then we're told it's going to be SARS.
[01:38:57.942 --> 01:38:59.163]  Then we're told it's going to be bird flu.
[01:38:59.683 --> 01:39:10.090]  And in every case, the government-allied pharmacological companies openly make billions of dollars off selling you the cure that they hype for the disease that never arrives.
[01:39:11.250 --> 01:39:15.413]  But someday I believe it will arrive, whatever its name is going to be.
[01:39:16.474 --> 01:39:21.297]  Whether it's airborne Ebola, or whether it's airborne human-to-human transmission disease,
[01:39:22.139 --> 01:39:23.882]  Person-to-person transmission bird flu.
[01:39:25.284 --> 01:39:26.305]  Who knows what it's going to be?
[01:39:27.367 --> 01:39:28.288]  But it'll be the same M.O.
[01:39:28.308 --> 01:39:31.172]  They'll openly have some Rumsfeld-controlled company.
[01:39:31.252 --> 01:39:31.953]  It's always that.
[01:39:32.374 --> 01:39:37.902]  Cipro, and then you've got Gilead with the Tamiflu, and it turns out that makes you sick and killed a bunch of people.
[01:39:38.162 --> 01:39:38.663]  Doesn't matter.
[01:39:41.617 --> 01:39:43.458]  And it's just all drills.
[01:39:43.518 --> 01:39:44.479]  It's all preparations.
[01:39:44.539 --> 01:39:47.320]  It's all just the fear, the fear, the fear, the fear, the fear.
[01:39:47.380 --> 01:39:55.605]  And oh, we screwed up in Katrina, so now we've got to really set up federalization of all the local cities and counties, emergency centers, so when this does happen, we can deal with it.
[01:39:55.625 --> 01:39:57.366]  And now we've got the Washington Post.
[01:39:58.306 --> 01:39:58.626]  U.S.
[01:39:58.666 --> 01:40:00.247]  plan for flu pandemic revealed.
[01:40:00.287 --> 01:40:02.708]  Multi-agency proposal awaits Bush approval.
[01:40:03.889 --> 01:40:09.092]  We already have everything under Homeland Security, and then that's under John Negroponte, the death squad commander and leader.
[01:40:09.918 --> 01:40:11.439]  Call him the Death Squad Czar.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.041]  Really is the proper term.
[01:40:15.182 --> 01:40:35.278]  And President Bush is expected to approve soon a national pandemic influenza response plan that identifies more than 300 specific tasks for federal agencies, including determining which frontline workers should be the first vaccinated and expanding Internet capacity to handle what would probably be a flood of people working from their home computers.
[01:40:35.298 --> 01:40:36.179]  And it just goes on and on.
[01:40:36.639 --> 01:40:38.481]  And that'll be Internet, too, and all the rest of it.
[01:40:40.259 --> 01:40:40.840]  And then you read it.
[01:40:40.860 --> 01:40:48.325]  It says, oh, the first thing we'll do is print our money overseas, as if Europe, that's where they're saying they'll print it, won't be hit by bird flu that pops up here.
[01:40:48.966 --> 01:40:49.546]  Makes no sense.
[01:40:49.586 --> 01:40:50.147]  It's already there.
[01:40:53.249 --> 01:40:54.230]  And then you read into it.
[01:40:54.350 --> 01:40:57.152]  There's all these plans about how to house the people.
[01:40:57.172 --> 01:41:00.174]  You know, we've got to build emergency centers to house all the people.
[01:41:00.635 --> 01:41:03.697]  In the 240-page plan I tried to scan over, it's pretty scary.
[01:41:06.323 --> 01:41:08.304]  Then we read other articles here.
[01:41:08.484 --> 01:41:10.204]  America's Secret Police State.
[01:41:11.024 --> 01:41:12.185]  America's Secret Police.
[01:41:13.225 --> 01:41:13.725]  Newsweek.
[01:41:14.606 --> 01:41:19.947]  Intelligence experts warn that a proposal to merge two Pentagon intelligence units could create an ominous new agency.
[01:41:20.687 --> 01:41:22.908]  And then you read it, and it's as if I wrote this article.
[01:41:23.748 --> 01:41:33.471]  It's all about mass arrests and spying on the American people, and it comes out that AT&T has NSA offices in all their major hubs, and everything goes through it.
[01:41:33.491 --> 01:41:34.212]  Well, that was news in 1996.
[01:41:36.528 --> 01:41:37.869]  I mean, just look at how bad it is.
[01:41:37.909 --> 01:41:38.869]  But the border's wide open.
[01:41:40.150 --> 01:41:48.535]  And it says, A threatened turf grab by a controversial Pentagon intelligence unit is causing concern among both privacy experts and some of the Defense Department's own personnel.
[01:41:48.555 --> 01:42:00.082]  An information panel of senior Pentagon officials has been holding a series of unannounced private meetings during the past several weeks about how to proceed with a possible merger between the counterintelligence field activity.
[01:42:00.422 --> 01:42:05.525]  That's the one that goes out and spies on mothers giving peanut butter jelly sandwiches out at peace rallies.
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:10.262]  A post-911 Pentagon creation that has been accused of domestic spying.
[01:42:10.342 --> 01:42:10.762]  Accused?
[01:42:10.802 --> 01:42:11.402]  It's admitted!
[01:42:12.763 --> 01:42:23.408]  And the Defense Security Service, DSS, a well-established older agency responsible for inspecting the security arrangements of defense contractors.
[01:42:24.369 --> 01:42:30.432]  DSS also maintains millions of confidential files containing the results of background investigations on defense contractors' employees.
[01:42:31.052 --> 01:42:31.913]  So they got the database.
[01:42:33.146 --> 01:42:35.367]  The merger was initially suggested by the government commission.
[01:42:35.387 --> 01:42:37.229]  Then you read deeper into it.
[01:42:37.869 --> 01:42:59.963]  It says the first erupted late 2005 on document service indicating that the CIFA, whose mission according to its own officials is supposed to be limited to analysis of counterintelligence data produced by other agencies, was discovered to have put together a database that included reports on anti-administration demonstrators including peace activists protesting alleged war profiteering by Halliburton.
[01:43:00.808 --> 01:43:01.528]  And it goes on.
[01:43:01.588 --> 01:43:02.489]  It just goes on and on.
[01:43:02.529 --> 01:43:07.670]  And it just says that it's a huge army of thousands and thousands of troops spying on the American people.
[01:43:07.690 --> 01:43:13.252]  Folks, ten years ago, I'd go to mainstream land rights events, and there'd be open U.S.
[01:43:13.372 --> 01:43:14.953]  Army in outfits videotaping.
[01:43:15.273 --> 01:43:15.613]  Okay?
[01:43:16.073 --> 01:43:17.213]  Of course it's a felony.
[01:43:17.273 --> 01:43:18.654]  Of course it's totally illegal.
[01:43:19.414 --> 01:43:22.755]  Now Bush is trying to change the law to legalize all this.
[01:43:22.795 --> 01:43:25.176]  And again, he says, we can torture, we're above the law.
[01:43:25.196 --> 01:43:27.457]  We can enforce the Patriot Act, even if you don't reauthorize.
[01:43:27.877 --> 01:43:28.237]  We can...
[01:43:29.588 --> 01:43:31.050]  Spy on you without warrants.
[01:43:31.211 --> 01:43:33.053]  We can leak Valerie Plame's name.
[01:43:33.233 --> 01:43:34.716]  We can do whatever we want!
[01:43:34.876 --> 01:43:38.381]  And I heard one of my old neocon buddies who's totally fallen into neocondom.
[01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:42.061]  Into the Imperial Neocon system.
[01:43:42.121 --> 01:43:43.641]  I was arguing with him the other day at the TV station.
[01:43:43.661 --> 01:43:44.602]  He goes, yeah, Bush can.
[01:43:44.622 --> 01:43:46.062]  He is above the law, Alex.
[01:43:46.523 --> 01:43:48.163]  They're on talk radio saying that's normal.
[01:43:48.183 --> 01:43:50.764]  See, they have to legitimize the dictatorship.
[01:43:51.044 --> 01:44:06.231]  The Houston Chronicle has to come out and legitimize these camps they're building with Halliburton, who runs the camps, Camp X-Ray and Gitmo in Cuba, runs the big camps over in Eastern Europe and runs the camps in the Middle East, has been caught white slave kidnapping.
[01:44:06.751 --> 01:44:09.072]  Houston Chronicle has reported on that.
[01:44:09.132 --> 01:44:09.652]  It's been in the
[01:44:11.204 --> 01:44:12.305]  Chicago Tribune.
[01:44:12.325 --> 01:44:14.266]  I mean, you can't make this stuff up.
[01:44:14.467 --> 01:44:15.387]  I can't believe it.
[01:44:18.910 --> 01:44:22.172]  It's so over the top.
[01:44:26.075 --> 01:44:32.260]  The good news is, more and more generals, more and more people in the military, more and more people in Hollywood, more and more people in Congress, more and more people...
[01:44:34.119 --> 01:45:03.070]  At universities, more and more prestigious individuals are saying, this is a joke, the former founder of, well, you're never a former founder, the former commander of Delta Force went public and said the whole war on terror is fake, there's no real threat, it's staged, the Iraq war is staged, our government's stirring things up in Iraq on purpose, MI6 officers are going public, now, what is it, eight generals in the last couple months, five of them in the last week, going public saying they should resign, it's a disaster, blah, blah, blah.
[01:45:04.056 --> 01:45:05.576]  It's going to be more and more and more.
[01:45:06.217 --> 01:45:10.798]  So don't think that even the NSA people listening to this show right now aren't on our side.
[01:45:12.238 --> 01:45:13.638]  Believe me, they hear all the intel.
[01:45:13.919 --> 01:45:14.939]  They know what's going on.
[01:45:14.999 --> 01:45:16.199]  Most of them love America.
[01:45:16.739 --> 01:45:25.862]  So as this evil just gets pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed, the good news is their own minions are waking up in droves.
[01:45:28.322 --> 01:45:31.063]  So we've always said it's got to get really bad before it gets better.
[01:45:32.958 --> 01:45:33.859]  And the truth is out.
[01:45:33.919 --> 01:45:41.403]  I mean, it's declassified dozens and dozens of examples of where our government admits they carried out terror attacks.
[01:45:41.443 --> 01:45:42.904]  And we're educating people about that.
[01:45:43.524 --> 01:45:44.905]  You could debate 9-11 all day.
[01:45:44.965 --> 01:45:45.586]  It's not debatable.
[01:45:45.606 --> 01:45:47.267]  You know the facts, that it was an inside job.
[01:45:47.307 --> 01:45:49.568]  But let's go look at where they're not denying it.
[01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:50.949]  You see?
[01:45:50.969 --> 01:45:59.274]  And barring Bush carrying out or his controllers carrying out some big attack, they're in deep trouble.
[01:46:01.241 --> 01:46:09.590]  The problem is they've told the CFR, they've told major publications, they've told a bunch of other prestigious groups that they are going to attack Iran in the next six to eight months.
[01:46:11.232 --> 01:46:14.335]  Special forces are there right now gearing up for all of this.
[01:46:17.358 --> 01:46:18.680]  And so I can now say high 90s.
[01:46:22.643 --> 01:46:33.788]  Unless some higher-level elite group puts the brakes on these neocons who I think they're going to hang out to dry later after they let them grab a bunch of living space, a bunch of new territories.
[01:46:34.608 --> 01:46:38.910]  The, quote, rogue nations in the, quote, Pentagon's new map that they call The Gap.
[01:46:42.712 --> 01:46:45.153]  Barring them slowing down, backing off,
[01:46:47.546 --> 01:46:50.607]  95% chance we're going to see huge terror attacks in America and England.
[01:46:50.927 --> 01:46:51.968]  And you know I haven't said this.
[01:46:51.988 --> 01:46:54.149]  You've been asking me for four and a half years, when's the next attack?
[01:46:54.769 --> 01:47:02.712]  And I've just really been thinking about it, doing a lot of focusing on this, a lot of research, a lot of intellect searching, a lot of studying.
[01:47:02.772 --> 01:47:12.576]  And I really do think that we're going to see, unless they back off, unless they put the brakes on, 95% chance in Western Europe or the U.S., a mega attack.
[01:47:13.425 --> 01:47:16.490]  Or it could even be a nuke going off in Iraq and claiming Iran did it.
[01:47:16.570 --> 01:47:16.910]  I don't know.
[01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:18.212]  But one of those three regions.
[01:47:19.534 --> 01:47:22.419]  They'll probably hit Dallas, Chicago, L.A., San Francisco.
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:24.882]  They could even hit New York again.
[01:47:25.503 --> 01:47:27.206]  I'm just laying it out for you here.
[01:47:30.146 --> 01:47:32.808]  Now, why do I think it's a 95% chance?
[01:47:33.329 --> 01:47:34.510]  I don't think they're going to back off.
[01:47:35.070 --> 01:47:36.131]  Because they can't stop.
[01:47:36.372 --> 01:47:37.393]  It's a Ponzi scheme.
[01:47:37.573 --> 01:47:46.360]  And a Ponzi scheme is where, you know, the average scam is you bring in, quote, investors, and you pay the first few hundred or first few thousand huge 20%, 30% gains in a year.
[01:47:46.721 --> 01:47:48.963]  Others hear about it and go invest even more.
[01:47:49.363 --> 01:47:52.906]  But you're using the new investments to pay off the original people to keep it rolling.
[01:47:52.926 --> 01:47:57.030]  And then when it builds up to a certain point, you don't pay off the rest of people and you run off with a billion bucks.
[01:47:58.206 --> 01:48:00.908]  Well, it's the same thing with this criminal New World Order system.
[01:48:01.769 --> 01:48:21.063]  It's gotten so big, there's so many scams, so many criminal operations, so many war profiteering examples, so many trillions missing from the Pentagon, so much corruption, so much evil, so much lying, so much forged intelligence, so many people going public that I always said it'd be a catch-22.
[01:48:21.164 --> 01:48:26.908]  If we expose them, they'll carry out a terror attack, and if we don't expose them, they'll carry out a terror attack to keep expanding what they're doing.
[01:48:27.535 --> 01:48:38.639]  But in the cast 22, it's better to go ahead and expose them, go ahead and let them carry out the next wave, so when they really try to move against us, I don't think it's going to be a hot war coup in America.
[01:48:39.079 --> 01:48:46.441]  I just think that it's going to be the jellyfish syndrome, where it's just they won't have the morale or the focus to carry it out.
[01:48:47.145 --> 01:48:55.690]  And I think the globalists even know that, but I think they'll still have enough control to loot the pension funds and run a bunch of scams, and it'll just be continual corruption.
[01:48:56.351 --> 01:49:00.874]  I'll probably still even be on the air calling them terrorists after the next attack, and they just don't care.
[01:49:00.934 --> 01:49:02.715]  They just keep moving forward.
[01:49:04.756 --> 01:49:06.337]  It's kind of like they've got a bulldozer.
[01:49:06.357 --> 01:49:07.858]  They know they can run through a building with it.
[01:49:08.138 --> 01:49:12.241]  They know it's going to ruin the bulldozer and make a tread come off of it, but they just don't care.
[01:49:12.641 --> 01:49:13.902]  They're still going to run over the country.
[01:49:15.484 --> 01:49:20.667]  So to all the surly neocon lovers who are in love with George Bush and all this, just enjoy what you've done to America.
[01:49:21.347 --> 01:49:25.410]  Dollar plunging again, gold going up, oil prices exploding, all this corruption.
[01:49:26.270 --> 01:49:29.832]  When we get back, fifth retired general calls for Rumsfeld's resignation last week.
[01:49:30.512 --> 01:49:31.633]  Retired colonel claims U.S.
[01:49:31.673 --> 01:49:33.194]  military operations are already underway.
[01:49:33.814 --> 01:49:38.417]  And starting next hour, we'll go to Pam, Todd, Jim, Ryan.
[01:49:39.366 --> 01:49:41.548]  Steve, Tyrone, many others.
[01:49:42.108 --> 01:49:42.529]  Stay with us.
[01:49:42.549 --> 01:49:43.109]  We'll get to you.
[01:49:43.490 --> 01:49:45.431]  But I got a lot of other news I need to hit before we do that.
[01:49:46.132 --> 01:49:46.732]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:46.752 --> 01:49:51.516]  The website's rinfowars.com, infowars.net, jonesreport.com, prisonplanet.tv.
[01:49:54.118 --> 01:49:58.502]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.662 --> 01:50:03.106]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:03.246 --> 01:50:04.487]  There is a chance.
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.568]  To use this disaster as a new world order.
[01:50:07.689 --> 01:50:08.993]  A new world order.
[01:50:09.736 --> 01:50:10.616]  We're good to go.
[01:50:10.636 --> 01:50:11.236]  We're good to go.
[01:50:35.964 --> 01:50:36.364]  We're good to go.
[01:50:36.384 --> 01:50:36.784]  We're good to go.
[01:50:53.849 --> 01:51:02.112]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:51:02.352 --> 01:51:06.713]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:51:07.013 --> 01:51:15.916]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:51:16.136 --> 01:51:19.737]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:51:20.037 --> 01:51:25.084]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:51:25.364 --> 01:51:32.073]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:51:32.583 --> 01:51:33.244]  What about you?
[01:51:33.884 --> 01:51:39.230]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:52:58.876 --> 01:53:00.797]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:53:01.257 --> 01:53:04.018]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:08.582 --> 01:53:13.125]  I mentioned this, but here it is in more detail out of the Herald Tribune.
[01:53:14.866 --> 01:53:17.968]  Fifth retired general calls for Rumsfeld's resignation.
[01:53:19.269 --> 01:53:24.513]  Washington, the widening circle of retired generals who have stepped forward to call for U.S.
[01:53:24.533 --> 01:53:32.578]  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's resignation, is shaping up as an unusual outcry that could pose a significant challenge.
[01:53:34.190 --> 01:53:38.271]  To Rumsfeld's leadership, current and former generals said Thursday.
[01:53:39.392 --> 01:53:45.314]  Folks, you get rid of Rumsfeld, one of his neocon deputies will step in to fill his shoes.
[01:53:45.354 --> 01:53:46.594]  It's like a great white shark.
[01:53:47.294 --> 01:53:48.775]  It's got row upon row of teeth.
[01:53:48.795 --> 01:53:51.936]  You don't try to rip the teeth out one by one.
[01:53:53.376 --> 01:53:57.778]  You have to get rid of the great white shark itself, and that's the new world order.
[01:53:59.511 --> 01:54:19.979]  Major General Charles H. Swanick, I believe I'm pronouncing that right, I'm going to try to get him on, who led troops on the ground in Iraq as recently as 2004 as the commander of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division, on Thursday became the fifth retired senior general in recent days to call publicly for Rumsfeld's ouster.
[01:54:20.780 --> 01:54:26.282]  Later in the day, another retired general, Major General John Riggs, joined in the fray.
[01:54:27.381 --> 01:54:35.623]  And, of course, they never mention Janice Karpinski, who we first interviewed here, talking about how she wasn't even allowed into the different torture camps, and they tried to blame her.
[01:54:35.963 --> 01:54:37.103]  She's called for his resignation.
[01:54:37.123 --> 01:54:38.504]  See, they don't count a bunch of other people.
[01:54:40.984 --> 01:54:47.466]  And if you notice what's happening here, they're just saying, oh, we need to continue to fight the global war on terror.
[01:54:47.526 --> 01:54:50.206]  It's just that he's not the right leader, the right leadership.
[01:54:52.347 --> 01:54:53.567]  And it's very frustrating to...
[01:54:55.177 --> 01:54:57.018]  You know, to see them just blaming Rumsfeld.
[01:54:57.058 --> 01:54:58.358]  Rumsfeld is the instrument.
[01:54:58.418 --> 01:55:00.860]  Rumsfeld, Bush has done a great job because he has.
[01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:06.942]  The real aim of Iraq wasn't to go in there and three months later leave or leave a year later.
[01:55:08.243 --> 01:55:22.009]  The Pentagon's own battle plan, P20G and the Israeli plan, and this is mainstream news if you want to go look it up, is to break the country into three or four regions and have endless civil war there against the sectarian groups.
[01:55:23.726 --> 01:55:24.126]  We're good to go.
[01:55:55.498 --> 01:55:58.660]  But the good news is people are not going along with it.
[01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:00.822]  People are waking up to what's really going on.
[01:56:02.323 --> 01:56:05.425]  But understand, when Bush has done a superb job, he has.
[01:56:06.286 --> 01:56:22.937]  The job is to break that country down and build 14 permanent megabases and over 100 other smaller bases, and to control that region, and to make sure the oil doesn't flow in large amounts, hence jacking up the price of all the other oil, which we'll cover after we take some calls in the next hour.
[01:56:22.957 --> 01:56:24.098]  We'll come back, take calls later.
[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:32.106]  And then get back into what's happening with the oil prices and how that ties into all of this and what's happening with the dollar and a lot more.
[01:56:33.467 --> 01:56:52.804]  Before I end this segment and end this hour, I do want to encourage you to go to InfoWars.com and to peruse the safe, secure online video and bookstore and to look at the great films we offer like Road to Tyranny, Martial Law, Loose Change 2nd Edition, George Humphrey's great 9-11 film, 9-11 The Great Illusion, Your Choice, Fear or Love,

[01:56:55.846 --> 01:56:57.847]  You need to get books like Codex Magica.
[01:56:57.887 --> 01:57:00.908]  Books like 9-11 Synthetic Terror made in the USA.
[01:57:01.708 --> 01:57:02.748]  It's all available.
[01:57:02.848 --> 01:57:03.748]  So many new items.
[01:57:03.808 --> 01:57:04.768]  Joan Bion's books.

[01:57:50.421 --> 01:57:51.081]  Big Brother.

[01:57:53.503 --> 01:57:54.623]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.284 --> 01:57:56.084]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.845 --> 01:57:57.745]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.405 --> 01:58:02.388]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.588 --> 01:58:06.690]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:23.978 --> 01:58:26.980]  Coming up, retired colonel claims U.S.
[01:58:27.040 --> 01:58:29.642]  military operations are already underway in Iran.
[01:58:30.662 --> 01:58:32.503]  We'll get into what's happening with the oil prices.
[01:58:33.964 --> 01:58:38.687]  Exxon chairman gets $400 million retirement package amid soaring gas prices.
[01:58:38.727 --> 01:58:48.953]  We'll get into all of it and get into some of the other little caveats and facets to the Charlie Sheen story going live on Jimmy Kimmel.
[01:58:49.927 --> 01:58:51.608]  And exposing 9-11.
[01:58:52.008 --> 01:58:52.608]  Just amazing.
[01:58:52.628 --> 01:58:55.449]  We'll re-air that clip coming up in this hour.
[01:58:56.570 --> 01:58:58.711]  Right now, let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[01:58:59.411 --> 01:59:02.612]  I guess up first would be Pam in New Mexico.
[01:59:02.672 --> 01:59:03.533]  Pam, thanks for holding.
[01:59:04.493 --> 01:59:05.874]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:59:05.914 --> 01:59:09.615]  I've got a couple things, and I'll try to get to at least one of them.
[01:59:09.895 --> 01:59:16.378]  I've been following Charlie Sheen's thing, and I'm so glad that he pointed out the...
[01:59:17.222 --> 01:59:24.706]  The false tapes on the Pentagon and also the Building 7 thing.
[01:59:24.726 --> 01:59:32.189]  But I wish that since he's so visible that he would bring out a couple other things.
[01:59:32.569 --> 01:59:41.254]  I wish he'd talk about the military drills, the stand-downs, the no windows in the airplanes.
[01:59:41.294 --> 01:59:44.055]  Well, I mean, he did come on this show and do everything you just listed.
[01:59:44.864 --> 01:59:52.171]  Oh, yeah, but he doesn't, when I hear him or read something about it, he doesn't, he could mention the put options and the remote.
[01:59:52.191 --> 01:59:56.215]  Well, I mean, you may be reading something someone else wrote about him.
[01:59:56.255 --> 01:59:57.176]  He can't control that.
[01:59:57.216 --> 02:00:00.879]  I mean, he's come on this broadcast twice and laid out everything you just listed.
[02:00:01.079 --> 02:00:01.820]  Right, okay.
[02:00:01.880 --> 02:00:05.023]  He also, again, was asked about it on national TV.
[02:00:07.699 --> 02:00:08.959]  I mean, put it to you this way.
[02:00:09.019 --> 02:00:18.803]  He has a national TV show on CBS, and I'm not at liberty to get into everything that's going on in the background, but can't you imagine he's already been pressured?
[02:00:19.983 --> 02:00:23.985]  See, it was pretty darn bold of him to go ahead and say what he said Friday night.
[02:00:24.845 --> 02:00:25.585]  Right, right.
[02:00:26.406 --> 02:00:27.506]  Yeah, well, okay.
[02:00:27.646 --> 02:00:32.988]  I just wish, if people knew, I mean, nobody ever mentions the stand-downs.
[02:00:34.213 --> 02:00:37.194]  Of the military, and if he just put that out there.
[02:00:37.494 --> 02:00:41.315]  I mean, I mentioned it on CNN nationally.
[02:00:42.135 --> 02:00:42.415]  Right.
[02:00:42.936 --> 02:00:43.496]  I know that.
[02:00:43.536 --> 02:00:50.018]  I just wish it would come out more, because people are so amazed when I tell them about the standout.
[02:00:50.138 --> 02:00:50.938]  They never heard about it.
[02:00:51.018 --> 02:00:51.838]  Well, I agree with you, Pam.
[02:00:51.898 --> 02:00:54.259]  It needs to come out more, and you're doing that right now on the radio.
[02:00:54.399 --> 02:00:56.479]  And call into other talk shows, say the same thing.
[02:00:56.799 --> 02:00:57.400]  Right, right.
[02:00:57.500 --> 02:00:58.340]  I mean, it's up to us.
[02:00:58.420 --> 02:00:59.120]  We've got to do it.
[02:00:59.880 --> 02:01:02.281]  And the other thing that I wanted to mention is that...
[02:01:03.197 --> 02:01:17.467]  I'm a Christian and I've got friends who are Christians and one of them is a dear friend who lives in Wyoming and we both have grandchildren and she just feels like, well, this is probably all true, it's probably the end times, but...
[02:01:18.715 --> 02:01:24.040]  But Jesus is going to take care of us, and God's in charge and everything.
[02:01:24.060 --> 02:01:27.324]  But I'm just so concerned.
[02:01:27.344 --> 02:01:29.386]  And so we don't have a job to warn other people.
[02:01:29.426 --> 02:01:30.867]  We don't have a job to fight evil.
[02:01:31.348 --> 02:01:35.512]  We can just lay down, and God will do it all, and that's the exact opposite of what the Bible says.
[02:01:35.652 --> 02:01:36.693]  That's what they're saying.
[02:01:36.833 --> 02:01:38.094]  It's so frustrating.
[02:01:38.134 --> 02:01:40.537]  That's what the government-controlled churches tell them.
[02:01:41.215 --> 02:01:41.956]  Right, I know.
[02:01:42.337 --> 02:01:52.230]  But my friend in Wyoming, she realizes all this, and she despises the Bush administration and the horse he rode in on.
[02:01:52.750 --> 02:01:56.836]  But she just feels that... Well, he's afraid of horses, so he wouldn't ride in on a horse.
[02:01:58.508 --> 02:01:58.968]  That's right.
[02:01:59.248 --> 02:02:12.582]  Well, it's the children that I'm worried about, you know, and the fact that they're doing all this stuff, this terrible stuff in the schools incrementally means that it hasn't come to New Mexico yet, it hasn't come to Wyoming yet.
[02:02:12.943 --> 02:02:14.324]  People don't believe me.
[02:02:14.444 --> 02:02:14.965]  You know what?
[02:02:15.466 --> 02:02:18.509]  I bet it's going on in schools and the parents don't even know it.
[02:02:19.529 --> 02:02:22.171]  It actually is going on in Wyoming and New Mexico.
[02:02:22.251 --> 02:02:22.911]  I've seen articles.
[02:02:23.191 --> 02:02:25.553]  They've got thumb scanners going in a lot of schools there.
[02:02:26.413 --> 02:02:28.274]  They've got being frisked.
[02:02:28.314 --> 02:02:30.035]  They've got cameras in the bathrooms.
[02:02:30.795 --> 02:02:31.956]  They've got drug testing.
[02:02:32.016 --> 02:02:32.856]  It's all going on.
[02:02:32.876 --> 02:02:35.978]  Yeah, people just don't know it's going on.
[02:02:36.218 --> 02:02:37.259]  It's out of sight, out of mind.
[02:02:37.319 --> 02:02:38.079]  Pam, great call.
[02:02:38.419 --> 02:02:39.200]  Thank you so much.
[02:02:39.640 --> 02:02:42.281]  We'll come back and talk to Todd, Jim, Tyrone, Steve, and others.
[02:02:42.702 --> 02:02:43.182]  Stay with us.
[02:02:47.344 --> 02:02:50.205]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:50.465 --> 02:02:52.046]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.

[02:02:57.388 --> 02:03:01.810]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:03:02.250 --> 02:03:06.452]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:06.652 --> 02:03:09.493]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:09.573 --> 02:03:14.235]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:14.455 --> 02:03:18.837]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:19.077 --> 02:03:26.319]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[02:04:47.253 --> 02:04:49.595]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:04:49.835 --> 02:04:51.877]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:04:52.037 --> 02:04:59.082]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[02:04:59.342 --> 02:05:07.949]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[02:05:08.249 --> 02:05:12.931]  Now for the first time, Calbin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[02:05:13.071 --> 02:05:17.112]  That's great news because Calbin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients.
[02:05:17.312 --> 02:05:19.753]  It's earth-friendly and completely environmentally safe.
[02:05:19.933 --> 02:05:24.274]  So if you want yesterday's values today for good old-fashioned pure soap, call 1-800-340-7091.
[02:05:27.675 --> 02:05:28.175]  We're good to go.
[02:05:59.162 --> 02:06:08.626]  In case you missed it, we've got the excerpt from Jimmy Kimmel live Friday night with Charlie Sheen where he gets asked about 9-11.
[02:06:09.006 --> 02:06:17.889]  That's coming up later in the show and if I have time I'll air maybe one or both of those CNN pieces from a few weeks ago.
[02:06:17.929 --> 02:06:18.830]  We've only aired that once.
[02:06:18.850 --> 02:06:20.690]  People have been requesting it and a lot of you missed it.
[02:06:20.990 --> 02:06:22.331]  It's pretty powerful stuff as well.
[02:06:23.708 --> 02:06:32.173]  Let me go ahead and go back to your calls, and then I'm going to get into some of the other news here in just a moment concerning Iran and oil, as I've been mentioning.
[02:06:32.994 --> 02:06:34.775]  Right now, let's go to Todd in Florida.
[02:06:34.795 --> 02:06:35.615]  Todd, thanks for holding.
[02:06:35.655 --> 02:06:35.995]  Go ahead.
[02:06:36.015 --> 02:06:50.884]  Hi, I'm pretty silly because I thought elections were real and everything was real, but Washington Journal and now Alex Jones, all the call-in people way back when, when I called in like an hour and a half ago, those were paid people.
[02:06:50.924 --> 02:06:52.445]  There were paid people calling in
[02:06:53.004 --> 02:06:55.385]  To actually lie and dance.
[02:06:55.845 --> 02:06:59.266]  And I hear that on Washington Journal, and I hear that on your show now.
[02:06:59.626 --> 02:07:03.587]  And I thought it was all about the truth, and I am going to be all about the truth.
[02:07:03.627 --> 02:07:15.731]  And I would like to talk about Dennis Cuddy and Dr. Stan Monteith, and really his book, Secret Records Revealed, and the posts that are involved.
[02:07:16.031 --> 02:07:16.911]  Now, maybe I'm dumb.
[02:07:17.391 --> 02:07:19.632]  Sometimes I miss the boat on things that are pretty obvious.
[02:07:20.342 --> 02:07:23.743]  What are you saying about Washington Journal and then this show?
[02:07:23.763 --> 02:07:31.085]  Oh, no, no, because I go into Yahoo forums, and they are paid people, and they call into you, and they play you.
[02:07:31.545 --> 02:07:34.286]  They're doing that right then, even as I listen.
[02:07:34.306 --> 02:07:37.827]  I understand that you listen to the calls.
[02:07:37.867 --> 02:07:38.888]  Sir, let me stop you.
[02:07:38.948 --> 02:07:39.968]  Let me stop you again.
[02:07:40.468 --> 02:07:41.528]  I'm not understanding.
[02:07:41.929 --> 02:07:43.369]  Talk to me like I'm five years old.
[02:07:43.929 --> 02:07:46.430]  Explain to me what you say is going on.
[02:07:46.850 --> 02:07:47.430]  I'm confused.
[02:07:48.070 --> 02:07:49.971]  COINTELPRO on a basic level.
[02:07:51.914 --> 02:07:54.116]  But you said people are calling in playing me.
[02:07:54.136 --> 02:07:55.137]  I don't understand that.
[02:07:55.558 --> 02:07:56.338]  Right, right.
[02:07:56.679 --> 02:07:59.101]  I mean, there were three calls in the first hour.
[02:07:59.121 --> 02:08:01.884]  And you'll listen to them later.
[02:08:01.904 --> 02:08:04.006]  And I wish everyone would.
[02:08:04.366 --> 02:08:05.487]  They are paid people.
[02:08:05.507 --> 02:08:06.408]  Let's do it this way.
[02:08:07.249 --> 02:08:08.931]  What did you hear on Washington Journal?
[02:08:10.132 --> 02:08:13.595]  I used to think, and way back when, I'm a silly boy.
[02:08:13.695 --> 02:08:15.497]  I used to think elections were real.
[02:08:16.047 --> 02:08:32.838]  I used to think Washington Journal was real, but after a while it begins to sink in that it's as deceptive as the fake elections, and what's happening in your forum, in your thing, sir, is that people are paid to call in and lie.
[02:08:33.259 --> 02:08:38.222]  Lie to me, lie to you, lie to their own heart and soul, and it's not a good thing.
[02:08:40.541 --> 02:08:41.902]  Anything else you'd like to add, sir?
[02:08:42.402 --> 02:08:42.923]  Oh, certainly.
[02:08:42.943 --> 02:08:44.724]  Wag the Dog, the movie.
[02:08:45.064 --> 02:08:55.072]  I think that the Hoffman character was Bruckheimer, and that part where National Treasure was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, that was kind of weird.
[02:08:55.472 --> 02:09:00.656]  And Dr. Stan Monteith and Dr. Dennis Cuddy with the secret records revealed.
[02:09:01.156 --> 02:09:02.157]  I have many quotes.
[02:09:02.217 --> 02:09:07.141]  The House of World Order will have to be built from the bottom rather than from the top.
[02:09:07.865 --> 02:09:08.385]  Oh, I know.
[02:09:08.445 --> 02:09:10.886]  Their own publications say it.
[02:09:10.906 --> 02:09:12.346]  I appreciate your call.
[02:09:12.366 --> 02:09:18.808]  I think what the caller is saying is that he thinks that the calls that disagree with me in this broadcast and the calls that
[02:09:35.137 --> 02:09:41.240]  Agree with the government line on Washington Journal with Lamb and others are staged.
[02:09:42.841 --> 02:09:45.922]  And certainly some phone calls are staged.
[02:09:46.022 --> 02:09:47.523]  Some people are on the payroll.
[02:09:48.563 --> 02:09:55.907]  But I have to say the majority of the people that disagree with me on this show just genuinely disagree or have some personal problem with me.
[02:09:57.512 --> 02:10:00.875]  There are hired COINTELPRO individuals.
[02:10:00.915 --> 02:10:10.683]  I mean, it's come out that Walmart spends tens of millions a year on fake blogs and fake news at the grassroots level.
[02:10:12.184 --> 02:10:23.874]  It is admitted that Bush spent $1.6 billion, and that's just what we know about, for fake newscasts, fake news productions.
[02:10:24.574 --> 02:10:26.516]  No one was ever told it was a government production.
[02:10:27.732 --> 02:10:34.458]  And for paying off reporters to write favorable columns and to go on as pundits on Fox and CNN and lie.
[02:10:35.799 --> 02:10:42.445]  A good example of this is former CENTCOM chief and former head of the Iraq War Operation, Tommy Franks, head of the invasion.
[02:10:44.107 --> 02:10:49.031]  I noticed during the election in 2004, he'd always get up on TV and go, Now listen, I'm not a Republican or a Democrat.
[02:10:49.071 --> 02:10:49.692]  I'm independent.
[02:10:50.592 --> 02:10:54.476]  But I totally agree with the war, and George Bush is absolutely right, and I just love everything he's doing.
[02:10:57.364 --> 02:11:07.329]  Well, it's now been confirmed mainstream that he gets $450-something thousand dollars a year as a White House paid propagandist.
[02:11:07.549 --> 02:11:09.130]  They call it public relations officer.
[02:11:10.170 --> 02:11:14.212]  He's paid, and he's going on these TV shows and saying he isn't paid.
[02:11:16.253 --> 02:11:17.974]  You can see him read the script on these shows.
[02:11:18.034 --> 02:11:24.397]  Imagine almost a half mil a year on top of his pension and everything else to just go around and lie.
[02:11:25.808 --> 02:11:27.189]  And there's thousands of these people.
[02:11:28.130 --> 02:11:32.193]  And yes, we know that say Viacom has hired thousands of bloggers.
[02:11:32.514 --> 02:11:36.097]  And this goes back, I saw a front line piece on this four years ago.
[02:11:37.798 --> 02:11:50.028]  On PBS of all places admitting that they have whole office buildings full of young hipsters on the message boards, on the blogs, hyping different bands and different things, different TV shows that Viacom has to young people.
[02:11:53.576 --> 02:11:55.177]  And this is how it works.
[02:11:55.317 --> 02:12:06.403]  A lot of what you see out there on the web attacking me are not government agents, but where the attacks originate from, we've tracked this and documented it, are government agents.
[02:12:07.704 --> 02:12:08.964]  They call it a mockingbird.
[02:12:09.004 --> 02:12:22.712]  Why did the CIA in the 70s, when their plan got declassified, forced to be declassified by Frank Church's senatorial committee, why did we then learn that it was called Operation Mockingbird?
[02:12:23.502 --> 02:12:24.922]  Well, what does a mockingbird do?
[02:12:25.342 --> 02:12:37.425]  A mockingbird hears a lawnmower, or hears you yelling at your wife, or hears a jackhammer, or hears another bird, or hears your dog barking or your cat meowing, and then it imitates it.
[02:12:37.445 --> 02:12:38.585]  It's a state bird of Texas.
[02:12:38.605 --> 02:12:39.745]  There's a whole bunch of them around here.
[02:12:40.245 --> 02:12:41.725]  You'll hear all kinds of weird sounds.
[02:12:41.745 --> 02:12:49.707]  You'll hear a mockingbird going... And, of course, it'll be right by a construction site where bulldozers have been working for a month.
[02:12:50.305 --> 02:12:53.647]  There's bulldozers behind my house, and now the Mockingbirds actually heard one the other night.
[02:12:54.587 --> 02:13:00.670]  It was right at dusk, and it was singing, I guess, to its girlfriend, and it was going... I mean, that's what they do.
[02:13:01.331 --> 02:13:03.972]  I'm now digressing into birds, folks.
[02:13:04.993 --> 02:13:05.733]  I've read a few books.
[02:13:06.093 --> 02:13:07.794]  I wouldn't call myself an ornithologist.
[02:13:07.814 --> 02:13:09.555]  There's so much to know about birds, but it's interesting.
[02:13:10.896 --> 02:13:12.236]  But that's why they call it Mockingbird.
[02:13:12.676 --> 02:13:13.537]  They put it out.
[02:13:15.180 --> 02:13:19.342]  And then a lot of weak-minded people go out and they parrot it and they push it.
[02:13:19.822 --> 02:13:23.464]  And it's always dissension and don't trust this person, don't trust that person.
[02:13:24.045 --> 02:13:31.989]  And to get most of the movement debating that and fighting with each other instead of out waking up other people, out saying we can win the fight against the New World Order.
[02:13:33.169 --> 02:13:37.732]  A lot of the COINTELPRO people are always saying, we're going to lose, there's nothing we can do, there's no way to beat it.
[02:13:37.752 --> 02:13:39.793]  It's the same story, same M.O.
[02:13:42.222 --> 02:13:43.862]  Here's an example of control, though.
[02:13:43.902 --> 02:13:47.943]  Brian Lamb has been asked hundreds of times to have me on by listeners, viewers.
[02:13:48.744 --> 02:13:55.925]  They've had people on attacking me multiple times where entire shows are dedicated to attacking me on Washington Journal and book reviews and other programs.
[02:13:57.886 --> 02:13:59.086]  And they will not have me on.
[02:13:59.726 --> 02:14:00.186]  I've called them.
[02:14:00.267 --> 02:14:01.247]  I've put in a request.
[02:14:01.307 --> 02:14:02.087]  Hey, let me respond.
[02:14:03.075 --> 02:14:16.807]  Let me come on and one time for about 60 seconds I got on during the RNC because it was a big line of people and they cut me off and wouldn't let me on and it was so obvious somebody at Mission Control said, no, check, let him back on.
[02:14:16.847 --> 02:14:17.447]  That looked bad.
[02:14:19.149 --> 02:14:20.790]  But C-SPAN is better than most forums.
[02:14:20.830 --> 02:14:21.911]  At least you can call in.
[02:14:21.971 --> 02:14:22.952]  I've called in over the years.
[02:14:22.972 --> 02:14:25.994]  I don't know, I've probably tried to call in 20 times or so.
[02:14:26.014 --> 02:14:27.496]  I think I've got in three or four times.
[02:14:29.838 --> 02:14:30.078]  So,
[02:14:32.538 --> 02:14:33.778]  Yes, it's bought and paid for.
[02:14:34.619 --> 02:14:36.339]  Yes, there's a lot of control going on.
[02:14:36.939 --> 02:14:40.801]  But most of it is parroting or mockingbirding.
[02:14:42.321 --> 02:14:45.282]  And here's another way mockingbird works.
[02:14:46.402 --> 02:14:55.005]  You'll have a top radio broadcaster in the country who's paid government, who's established, put in positions of power, paid more than their show even makes.
[02:14:56.503 --> 02:14:58.484]  They are then the benchmark of success.
[02:14:58.524 --> 02:15:01.006]  They're not really successful because of the talent of their show.
[02:15:01.306 --> 02:15:03.827]  They're successful because they've been promoted and put in key positions.
[02:15:04.167 --> 02:15:09.510]  I mean, they're somewhat listenable, but obviously higher ratings could be garnered with different types of programs.
[02:15:11.331 --> 02:15:16.494]  Everybody in the industry sees that and then tries to duplicate what they're doing, thinking that brings success.
[02:15:18.075 --> 02:15:18.375]  Okay?
[02:15:20.063 --> 02:15:28.588]  Same thing with the top journalists from the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Washington Times, who always get on all the shows, who get their books promoted, who make all the money.
[02:15:29.148 --> 02:15:32.811]  Then all the reporters see that and think, man, you know, that must be the popular view.
[02:15:32.851 --> 02:15:33.951]  That must be who's right.
[02:15:34.432 --> 02:15:35.772]  I'll just parrot what they say.
[02:15:36.753 --> 02:15:38.134]  This is how it works in academia.
[02:15:39.034 --> 02:15:42.036]  The big foundations will fund them, push their books.
[02:15:42.436 --> 02:15:45.418]  These professors will make millions of dollars because they promote killing children.
[02:15:46.821 --> 02:15:56.024]  90% of the population, they promote one world government, and then all the other professors see that, and it's the peer pressure of, oh, that's what the cool people say.
[02:15:56.084 --> 02:16:00.485]  That's what the cutting edge, avant-garde say.
[02:16:01.765 --> 02:16:02.566]  So it's peer pressure.
[02:16:03.806 --> 02:16:06.067]  So a lot of this stuff is not Mockingbird.
[02:16:08.948 --> 02:16:10.748]  It's not originating from a Mockingbird.
[02:16:10.848 --> 02:16:14.129]  It's just being parroted through a Mockingbird operation.
[02:16:16.658 --> 02:16:18.199]  And this stuff gets used as a template.
[02:16:18.799 --> 02:16:30.546]  Homeland Security Director's cousin, Benjamin Chertoff, gets together with a team of seven people, writes a shoddy hit piece, because the rest of the media is so lazy, and then they use that as a template, always referring to that now, basically forever.
[02:16:30.846 --> 02:16:33.667]  It's like the Warren Commission report on the 9-11 truth movement.
[02:16:33.968 --> 02:16:36.189]  It's a fraud, but that's the template people use.
[02:16:38.470 --> 02:16:39.531]  You understand what I'm saying?
[02:16:40.271 --> 02:16:40.731]  I know you do.
[02:16:41.792 --> 02:16:42.993]  We'll come back, take more calls.
[02:16:43.353 --> 02:16:45.514]  I've got to hurry through these calls, because I've got all this news to cover.
[02:16:46.215 --> 02:16:47.776]  Retired Colonel claims U.S.
[02:16:47.836 --> 02:16:49.596]  military operations are already underway in Iran.
[02:16:50.817 --> 02:16:51.497]  And a lot more.
[02:16:52.077 --> 02:16:54.238]  I want to talk about oil prices and gold and a lot more.
[02:16:54.298 --> 02:16:57.860]  But I was up working too late last night.
[02:16:57.880 --> 02:17:00.361]  I'm kind of dingy today.
[02:17:00.381 --> 02:17:03.202]  Oh, man.
[02:17:03.242 --> 02:17:06.743]  I just can't believe how criminal it all is.
[02:17:07.284 --> 02:17:09.604]  I just can't believe how out in the open it all is.
[02:17:09.745 --> 02:17:13.066]  It's just... It's mind-blowing.
[02:17:15.067 --> 02:17:15.767]  It's mind-blowing.
[02:17:17.088 --> 02:17:30.816]  And to see so many saps who follow the Democratic Party or who follow the Republican Party and who just pick up the whole political fairy tales that they're given and just believe it.
[02:17:31.497 --> 02:17:35.719]  And then you think you're cool, snickering and giggling about it.
[02:17:36.339 --> 02:17:37.720]  Man, none of this is funny.
[02:17:38.781 --> 02:17:40.762]  Your ignorance isn't funny, it's scary.
[02:17:43.757 --> 02:17:45.819]  Gee, honey, those new sandals look great on you.
[02:17:46.039 --> 02:17:48.260]  And look, they show off my new toenails, too.
[02:17:48.581 --> 02:17:49.261]  New toenails?
[02:17:49.621 --> 02:17:50.622]  What happened to the old ones?
[02:17:51.603 --> 02:17:54.265]  Well, they're not really new, just clear and healthy looking.
[02:17:54.813 --> 02:17:56.254]  Remember how embarrassed I was?
[02:17:56.635 --> 02:17:59.057]  They were so discolored, really awful looking.
[02:17:59.277 --> 02:18:00.658]  Well, they sure look clear now.
[02:18:00.678 --> 02:18:02.800]  Gosh, I wish I could wear sandals again.
[02:18:02.940 --> 02:18:04.282]  My toenails are a disaster.
[02:18:04.342 --> 02:18:07.144]  Look, this one looks white, and that one's thick and yellow.
[02:18:07.384 --> 02:18:08.626]  Well, here's my secret.
[02:18:09.186 --> 02:18:10.227]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:18:10.707 --> 02:18:14.791]  It clears out yellowing keratin debris, the source of nail discoloration.
[02:18:15.492 --> 02:18:16.393]  Ah, so that's it.
[02:18:16.653 --> 02:18:19.195]  I've got ugly keratin debris built up under my nails.
[02:18:19.475 --> 02:18:21.097]  And Non-X Nail Gel gets rid of it.
[02:18:21.577 --> 02:18:24.678]  Now, you'll need to use it every day, but clear nails are worth it.
[02:18:25.058 --> 02:18:25.598]  You bet!

[02:18:30.080 --> 02:18:31.621]  Thanks to Nonex Nail Gel.

[02:19:46.401 --> 02:19:49.183]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:19:49.443 --> 02:19:53.605]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:19:54.025 --> 02:19:54.866]  So what do you do?
[02:19:55.166 --> 02:19:59.749]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?

[02:20:50.762 --> 02:21:03.692]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[02:21:03.873 --> 02:21:05.654]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[02:21:05.834 --> 02:21:09.297]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[02:21:09.577 --> 02:21:13.361]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?

[02:21:33.078 --> 02:21:33.838]  I'm from Wisconsin.
[02:21:33.878 --> 02:21:34.359]  Welcome.
[02:21:58.570 --> 02:22:03.313]  Yeah, just a brief comment about the alleged History Channel Charlie Sheen thing.
[02:22:03.813 --> 02:22:12.358]  I hate to dwell on this, but it just so happens I downloaded the program in question a couple days ago, and I watched it while I was on hold.
[02:22:13.298 --> 02:22:19.002]  The name Charlie Sheen is never uttered in audio or shown in text in the whole thing.
[02:22:19.442 --> 02:22:21.303]  What they do have is a still picture.
[02:22:22.323 --> 02:22:26.586]  When they're talking about the Bilderbergs, they show little montages of
[02:22:27.661 --> 02:22:31.943]  People, you never see their faces, just people in suits going into nice buildings.
[02:22:32.383 --> 02:22:35.624]  You don't even know if it's supposed to be actually the Bilderbergers.
[02:22:36.104 --> 02:22:38.545]  There's no context given to the photos, is what I'm saying.
[02:22:39.066 --> 02:22:42.547]  And there's a photo of a guy who kind of looks like Charlie Sheen, and that's it.
[02:22:43.673 --> 02:22:52.457]  Yeah, I talked to the caller, Kevin in Alabama, during the break, and in between cussing at me, I mean, imagine, I go on the line and I go, listen, Kevin, I want to work with you.
[02:22:52.897 --> 02:22:53.898]  Just mail me the tape.
[02:22:54.098 --> 02:22:55.678]  I don't trust you, bleeper!
[02:22:56.539 --> 02:22:58.360]  I want to hand deliver it.
[02:22:58.400 --> 02:22:59.520]  I mean, it was kind of scaring me.
[02:22:59.880 --> 02:23:03.542]  And I'm like, listen, sir, if it's true, I'll put it on there.
[02:23:03.882 --> 02:23:05.563]  I've asked the listeners to call in about it.
[02:23:05.623 --> 02:23:06.743]  People have told me it's not true.
[02:23:06.803 --> 02:23:08.304]  I've asked Sheen about it.
[02:23:08.944 --> 02:23:10.685]  And I said, what is it?
[02:23:10.705 --> 02:23:16.607]  He goes, there's a picture talking about how Hollywood people go to it and it looks like him.
[02:23:16.627 --> 02:23:19.328]  And I said, well, okay.
[02:23:19.348 --> 02:23:21.229]  And I said, will you send it to me?
[02:23:21.329 --> 02:23:22.729]  I don't trust you!
[02:23:22.749 --> 02:23:26.651]  And I'm just like, whoa!
[02:23:26.951 --> 02:23:28.452]  I'll send you a screen capture.
[02:23:28.512 --> 02:23:29.092]  I can do that.
[02:23:29.112 --> 02:23:30.552]  I'll send it to the site or whatever.
[02:23:30.572 --> 02:23:31.393]  Yeah, send it to...
[02:23:32.671 --> 02:23:38.839]  To tips at InfoWars.com or send it to Kevin at InfoWars.com.
[02:23:39.139 --> 02:23:39.379]  All right.
[02:23:40.601 --> 02:23:47.630]  Well, regardless of if it is Charlie Sheen, it doesn't matter what he thinks or says about 9-11.
[02:23:47.690 --> 02:23:50.193]  It should be obvious to everyone it was an inside job.
[02:23:50.951 --> 02:23:53.273]  You know, I mean, it's great that he's doing what he's doing.
[02:23:53.353 --> 02:23:55.114]  Then people say he hasn't done enough.
[02:23:55.174 --> 02:23:56.715]  Well, you've got to love this.
[02:23:56.735 --> 02:24:02.359]  When people stand up, do something, put their careers on the line, if you only knew the behind-the-scenes stuff, folks, he's gone through.
[02:24:03.039 --> 02:24:06.882]  All of this happens, and then he needs to do more.
[02:24:06.902 --> 02:24:14.067]  You know, it's not enough to challenge Larry Silverstein openly on your show, and it's not enough to be incredibly bold and courageous.
[02:24:14.967 --> 02:24:16.248]  People do this to me all the time, man.
[02:24:16.268 --> 02:24:18.089]  They go, Alex, you're not doing enough.
[02:24:18.429 --> 02:24:19.510]  You need to do more.
[02:24:19.550 --> 02:24:20.511]  You're a traitor.
[02:24:21.191 --> 02:24:29.318]  Well, they're just not doing anything themselves, so they've just got to lash out and, you know, got to do something, people.
[02:24:29.978 --> 02:24:31.940]  But, I mean, it's not true.
[02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.342]  I called a few Bilderberg experts, and they said no.
[02:24:35.091 --> 02:24:36.512]  Charlie Sheen has never been there.
[02:24:36.552 --> 02:24:37.252]  They photograph.
[02:24:37.272 --> 02:24:38.333]  They know everybody that goes.
[02:24:38.353 --> 02:24:39.433]  They get the list every year.
[02:24:39.853 --> 02:24:40.794]  I went and checked the list.
[02:24:40.874 --> 02:24:41.414]  I asked him.
[02:24:41.454 --> 02:24:42.454]  He said, of course not.
[02:24:42.494 --> 02:24:44.996]  He goes, I'd love to, though, and find out what they're doing.
[02:24:45.036 --> 02:24:50.038]  In fact, I don't want to get off into private conversations, but before, he was asking me about the Bilderberg Group.
[02:24:50.058 --> 02:24:51.379]  He was asking about who runs things.
[02:24:51.679 --> 02:24:56.001]  It's just not true, but I gave the guy the benefit of the doubt and said, okay, show me proof.
[02:24:56.401 --> 02:24:57.061]  Play a clip.
[02:24:57.401 --> 02:24:58.702]  In the clip, it's a...
[02:24:59.182 --> 02:25:05.184]  Yeah, I mean, it's just, okay, you bleepin' piece of bleep, and I'm just like, man, what is the problem?
[02:25:05.444 --> 02:25:11.945]  The whole program, the History Channel thing, is like it's tabloid in its nature, and there's no context for the photo.
[02:25:12.045 --> 02:25:18.527]  It's just in a parking lot somewhere, so it's completely... It's somebody that looks like Sheen and Ted Turner, right?
[02:25:19.447 --> 02:25:20.927]  It's some guy with a mustache.
[02:25:20.967 --> 02:25:22.828]  He looks like he could play Hitler in a movie.
[02:25:22.888 --> 02:25:24.208]  I mean, it could be anyone.
[02:25:25.328 --> 02:25:26.649]  Well, no, it's conclusive proof.
[02:25:26.729 --> 02:25:27.269]  Thanks for the call.
[02:25:30.246 --> 02:25:32.627]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tyrone in Canada.
[02:25:32.647 --> 02:25:33.707]  Tyrone, thanks for holding.
[02:25:34.988 --> 02:25:35.288]  Hello?
[02:25:35.568 --> 02:25:35.888]  Yes, sir.
[02:25:36.648 --> 02:25:37.209]  Hi.
[02:25:37.429 --> 02:25:41.611]  I just wanted to tell you about something that I discovered by accident.
[02:25:41.631 --> 02:25:51.495]  I actually just stumbled upon it doing a lab on photosynthesis, and it has to do with carbon dioxide emissions and the claim that human activities are causing global warming.
[02:25:51.895 --> 02:25:52.115]  Yes.
[02:25:53.050 --> 02:26:07.342]  And what I found was that actually the amount of carbon dioxide that can be fixed by the biosphere, it's on page 162 of the Nielsen 12 textbook, is 3.5 times 10 to the 16 kilograms.
[02:26:08.343 --> 02:26:21.734]  And then from global warming information websites that I found, and also off Wikipedia, what I found is that 6.5 billion kilograms of CO2 are put into the atmosphere.
[02:26:22.321 --> 02:26:36.392]  And then when I calculated, what that actually meant was that our activities contribute 1 over 50,000 of a percent of the overall CO2 levels in the atmosphere.
[02:26:36.412 --> 02:26:39.434]  Yeah, but bovine flatulence is much greater than they claim.
[02:26:39.875 --> 02:26:49.242]  Well, you know, there's too many cows, but the actual number of bovine on the surface of the planet is similar to what it was thousands of years ago under natural bovine herd populations.
[02:26:49.813 --> 02:26:50.693]  Precisely.
[02:26:50.934 --> 02:27:00.859]  And another thing which should be obvious to anyone who knows about plants is that in the presence of increased levels of CO2... They simply metabolize more and grow faster.
[02:27:00.899 --> 02:27:01.319]  Exactly.
[02:27:01.539 --> 02:27:01.919]  Exactly.
[02:27:02.379 --> 02:27:05.561]  And I lived in New Mexico... You know what you should do?
[02:27:05.581 --> 02:27:08.282]  You ought to write an article about this for us.
[02:27:08.362 --> 02:27:11.184]  I've written it all up in a lab report, and I'll send it to you.
[02:27:11.284 --> 02:27:11.824]  Yeah, email it.
[02:27:11.864 --> 02:27:12.765]  All the calculations are there.
[02:27:12.945 --> 02:27:13.425]  Well, stay there.
[02:27:13.445 --> 02:27:14.205]  I'll let you finish up.
[02:27:14.926 --> 02:27:17.147]  Look, folks, I'm not saying we don't have climate change.
[02:27:17.187 --> 02:27:19.008]  The sun just had its...
[02:27:20.228 --> 02:27:24.391]  Brightest cycle ever recorded, and it's about to have one 50% brighter.
[02:27:25.993 --> 02:27:29.656]  I mean, our effects compared to volcanoes of the sun doesn't even register.
[02:27:33.939 --> 02:27:34.840]  We're on the march.
[02:27:35.340 --> 02:27:36.942]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:37.843 --> 02:27:40.565]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:43.823 --> 02:27:47.866]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:27:48.086 --> 02:27:51.488]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:27:51.669 --> 02:27:55.111]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:27:55.396 --> 02:27:58.659]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:27:58.679 --> 02:28:04.144]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:28:04.184 --> 02:28:13.813]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:28:13.933 --> 02:28:15.294]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[02:28:15.314 --> 02:28:20.719]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:28:21.218 --> 02:28:25.640]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:28:25.660 --> 02:28:27.100]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:28:27.260 --> 02:28:31.142]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.

[02:28:44.429 --> 02:28:47.410]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.

[02:29:02.055 --> 02:29:08.777]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:29:09.177 --> 02:29:20.961]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:29:21.441 --> 02:29:25.903]  The Berkey Lights rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[02:29:31.666 --> 02:29:33.127]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:29:33.147 --> 02:29:34.187]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:29:43.795 --> 02:29:47.116]  And now a word from Dr. Patricia Margaitis from Stem Enhance.
[02:29:47.556 --> 02:29:51.718]  I want to first thank the wonderful GCN listeners for supporting Stem Enhance.
[02:29:52.238 --> 02:29:59.621]  Now know that your own stem cells are your body's maintenance group, and Stem Enhance makes sure that more of them show up for work every day.
[02:30:00.049 --> 02:30:04.032]  The truth is, the more stem cells you have in your bloodstream, the greater your health.
[02:30:04.432 --> 02:30:17.883]  If you believe there is something more for you, have a strong work ethic, and wish to participate in the monumental increase in the cause for natural health while gaining financial independence and monthly cash flow, then you are the right person.
[02:30:18.303 --> 02:30:21.666]  I personally invite you to join me as a distributor of Stem Enhancers.
[02:30:22.057 --> 02:30:26.318]  I am committed to personally make sure you receive the tools needed to succeed.
[02:30:26.678 --> 02:30:29.579]  Remember, the first rule of success, you must show up.
[02:30:29.739 --> 02:30:33.040]  Call me, Dr. Patricia Margitis, at 860-567-7744.
[02:30:33.100 --> 02:30:34.060]  That number again, 860-567-7744.
[02:30:51.681 --> 02:30:54.403]  All right, I'm going to take five more calls after I cover some more news.
[02:30:56.444 --> 02:30:57.264]  I've got to hurry now.
[02:30:57.305 --> 02:30:59.386]  We're running low on time here.
[02:31:00.687 --> 02:31:11.073]  I meant to tell you this during the break, John, specifically cue it up to my second CNN appearance without the big intro, just to that six-minute clip.
[02:31:11.113 --> 02:31:12.674]  I'm going to try to play that because I promised to.
[02:31:13.274 --> 02:31:15.576]  I've also promised to play the Sheen clip again.
[02:31:16.539 --> 02:31:17.480]  So we'll do that in a few minutes.
[02:31:17.520 --> 02:31:19.542]  I've got some other news I want to hit on.
[02:31:19.582 --> 02:31:20.883]  But listen, folks.
[02:31:21.544 --> 02:31:38.900]  Genetic engineering and the wild cross-species engineering that's going on, the new creations they're making and releasing open air in the seas and on the land, are incredibly dangerous to human life and the entire life of the biosphere on this planet.
[02:31:40.402 --> 02:31:41.703]  Or the interlocking biospheres.
[02:31:42.682 --> 02:31:49.186]  And the phony environmentalists could care less about that because they're funded openly by big banks to steal private property and set up the pretext for global taxation.
[02:31:50.847 --> 02:31:52.549]  CO2s weren't hurting the ozone layer.
[02:31:52.569 --> 02:31:53.609]  That's been proven to be a fraud.
[02:31:53.629 --> 02:32:04.076]  The big companies got together whenever their patents were running out on Freon to force something new, and they forced the adoption of what they had out that had a patent on it.
[02:32:05.878 --> 02:32:10.961]  And if you look at the calculations of the amount of gases ejected from a major volcanic incident...
[02:32:11.499 --> 02:32:13.880]  That we have on average every two years on the planet.
[02:32:15.241 --> 02:32:27.387]  Each large volcanic gas explosion puts out more CO2 and more gases and more greenhouse emissions than all human activity in the last thousand plus years.
[02:32:28.708 --> 02:32:33.030]  And then if you look at the sun's effect on the climate, that dwarfs everything else.
[02:32:34.415 --> 02:32:38.860]  So, it's just a global tax, and that's all they're doing, and they're fear-mongering.
[02:32:39.100 --> 02:32:40.541]  There are climate changes going on.
[02:32:40.601 --> 02:32:49.670]  Parts of the Earth are getting colder, other parts are getting hotter, and that's been the Earth's history, all the ice core samples from Antarctica, and of course the northern ice sheet shows that as well, North Pole.
[02:32:50.812 --> 02:32:52.493]  I don't have time to do a dissertation on this.
[02:32:52.854 --> 02:32:54.035]  I've actually studied it in depth.
[02:32:54.736 --> 02:32:57.719]  And most scientists concur with the statements I've made.
[02:32:57.739 --> 02:33:00.681]  I'm just going off their facts, but they don't get the big prestigious funding.
[02:33:01.021 --> 02:33:02.202]  They get bullied into silence.
[02:33:02.463 --> 02:33:04.684]  Go ahead and finish up what you were saying, Tyrone.
[02:33:04.745 --> 02:33:14.293]  Yeah, I actually did a calculation on, let's just say hypothetically, that none of the CO2 we emitted was absorbed and used for organic molecules in plants.
[02:33:14.733 --> 02:33:21.719]  If that was the case, it would take, as they claim that we've risen carbon dioxide levels by 100%, it would have taken 5.3 million years to
[02:33:23.629 --> 02:33:24.429]  To raise it by 100%.
[02:33:24.489 --> 02:33:33.814]  And if it was in fact 30%, which is a more conservative estimate that we've risen the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere by 30%, it would have taken 1.6 million years.
[02:33:33.834 --> 02:33:36.595]  So that's just something to think about.
[02:33:37.335 --> 02:33:44.379]  And one more thing that I wanted to mention is that I lived in New Mexico in 2001 when the World Trade Centers were hit.
[02:33:45.759 --> 02:33:51.882]  And it was shocking to me how many times they compared the event to Pearl Harbor.
[02:33:52.233 --> 02:33:55.974]  They kept mentioning Pearl Harbor over and over and over again, like this is a new Pearl Harbor.
[02:33:56.234 --> 02:33:58.115]  Yeah, they were following the script.
[02:33:58.135 --> 02:33:58.815]  Thanks for the call.
[02:33:59.815 --> 02:34:02.336]  Quickly now, let's talk to Steve in Indiana.
[02:34:02.356 --> 02:34:02.916]  Steve, go ahead.
[02:34:04.536 --> 02:34:05.216]  How you doing, sir?
[02:34:05.396 --> 02:34:05.717]  Good, sir.
[02:34:06.017 --> 02:34:15.579]  Hey, I talk on the George Riley Show as well as Troy's Show on Richmond, and I want the veterans on Veterans Rights because they're trying to take away half our pension.
[02:34:15.839 --> 02:34:16.099]  I know.
[02:34:16.399 --> 02:34:18.680]  And they're trying to close down the VA hospitals.
[02:34:19.167 --> 02:34:28.036]  I mean, why are we even fighting for this country if they're selling it out from underneath us and treating us like dirt and taking away things from us?
[02:34:28.136 --> 02:34:29.878]  Why are they doing this?
[02:34:30.519 --> 02:34:34.523]  It's not understanding, but I've got the utmost respect for you because I'm like you.
[02:34:35.003 --> 02:34:38.307]  I've outspoken myself to everybody to let them know what's going on.
[02:34:39.614 --> 02:34:40.355]  Thanks for the call.
[02:34:40.375 --> 02:34:40.735]  Makes me sick.
[02:35:07.276 --> 02:35:09.436]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dave in Michigan.
[02:35:09.456 --> 02:35:10.137]  Dave, go ahead.
[02:35:10.157 --> 02:35:11.537]  Hi, Alex.
[02:35:11.957 --> 02:35:12.197]  Hi.
[02:35:12.917 --> 02:35:14.337]  I wanted to bring your attention.
[02:35:14.357 --> 02:35:25.579]  I don't know if you saw it or not, but this Mike Rupert guy, he seems to be on the level as far as CIA involvement with drug trafficking and that being part of the reason for 9-11.
[02:35:26.139 --> 02:35:27.960]  But he recently wrote a hit piece on you.
[02:35:28.260 --> 02:35:28.820]  Yeah, you know what?
[02:35:29.240 --> 02:35:30.460]  Yeah, I know.
[02:35:30.600 --> 02:35:33.841]  And call it, why give the person the attention they want?
[02:35:34.341 --> 02:35:35.641]  Why even look at it?
[02:35:35.701 --> 02:35:35.901]  I mean...
[02:35:36.701 --> 02:35:37.641]  I appreciate your call.
[02:35:37.741 --> 02:35:44.803]  The guy you mentioned a year ago announced the 9-11 Truth Movement was dead.
[02:35:45.723 --> 02:35:46.683]  Stop covering it.
[02:35:47.203 --> 02:35:48.623]  He said, I'm the Grand Poobah.
[02:35:48.723 --> 02:35:49.784]  I say stop covering it.
[02:35:49.804 --> 02:35:50.464]  We'll look at it today.
[02:35:50.504 --> 02:35:51.864]  It's bigger than it's ever been.
[02:35:51.904 --> 02:35:52.824]  We better expose it.
[02:35:52.864 --> 02:35:53.885]  It's the foundational event.
[02:35:54.565 --> 02:35:57.885]  And he's involved with all these population control groups and peak oil.
[02:35:59.166 --> 02:36:00.006]  It doesn't matter.
[02:36:00.766 --> 02:36:04.907]  And again, if I spent all day covering all the hit pieces I'm under...
[02:36:06.388 --> 02:36:08.548]  I mean, you know, you've got this former cop.
[02:36:08.708 --> 02:36:11.729]  He admits his CIA girlfriend and all this.
[02:36:11.749 --> 02:36:14.069]  I mean, who cares?
[02:36:14.149 --> 02:36:14.749]  I don't care.
[02:36:14.830 --> 02:36:16.050]  My show isn't about that guy.
[02:36:18.350 --> 02:36:19.810]  And really, I don't want to spend any more time on it.
[02:36:19.850 --> 02:36:24.611]  I mean, it's just disgusting that people spend their time doing stuff like that.
[02:36:24.651 --> 02:36:25.591]  But I'm above it.
[02:36:26.252 --> 02:36:28.132]  I don't even respond to it, to the savaging.
[02:36:28.892 --> 02:36:30.212]  I've been savaged repeatedly.
[02:36:31.392 --> 02:36:33.653]  Let's talk to Elias in Michigan.
[02:36:33.693 --> 02:36:34.473]  Elias, go ahead.
[02:36:36.653 --> 02:36:37.313]  Hi, how are you doing?
[02:36:37.874 --> 02:36:38.194]  Good, sir.
[02:36:38.474 --> 02:36:39.574]  Good, good.
[02:36:39.614 --> 02:36:42.415]  Yeah, you're a lady caller for their mother in New York.
[02:36:42.576 --> 02:36:45.117]  Maybe your mother would be interested in this.
[02:36:45.157 --> 02:36:49.919]  They say they're setting up millions of cameras now in New York, especially in Brooklyn.
[02:36:50.159 --> 02:36:50.899]  Yes.
[02:36:52.340 --> 02:36:53.440]  So that should interest her.
[02:36:53.460 --> 02:36:55.321]  She seems like a very intelligent person.
[02:36:55.721 --> 02:37:00.283]  And for those that don't get that, London has four and a half million surveillance cameras.
[02:37:00.303 --> 02:37:01.784]  Well, this is evidently in New York.
[02:37:01.864 --> 02:37:02.384]  No, I know.
[02:37:02.544 --> 02:37:03.244]  They haven't had that.
[02:37:03.264 --> 02:37:03.965]  That's something new.
[02:37:03.985 --> 02:37:05.005]  They're going to put them up.
[02:37:05.632 --> 02:37:07.293]  We're going to be watching them all.
[02:37:07.393 --> 02:37:10.695]  They're going to put up $3 billion in federally funded cameras.
[02:37:11.056 --> 02:37:13.597]  They already put up a billion dollars worth of cameras in Boston.
[02:37:13.957 --> 02:37:15.278]  Welcome in the new age.
[02:37:15.298 --> 02:37:17.139]  The new age of watching.
[02:37:17.159 --> 02:37:19.201]  Oh, watching.
[02:37:19.221 --> 02:37:20.682]  We're going to do the watching.
[02:37:20.762 --> 02:37:21.943]  We're going to watch the watchers.
[02:37:22.203 --> 02:37:23.884]  I wish they'd put those cameras on the border.
[02:37:23.904 --> 02:37:25.625]  Thanks for the call, but don't hold your breath.
[02:37:26.045 --> 02:37:27.966]  Last caller, Tom in Tennessee.
[02:37:28.006 --> 02:37:28.407]  Go ahead.
[02:37:29.167 --> 02:37:29.788]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:37:29.808 --> 02:37:35.031]  I haven't listened to your show for about six months, and I tell everyone I can about your website, my family, my friends.
[02:37:35.732 --> 02:37:37.853]  And I know you say you're a Christian, and I'm a Christian as well.
[02:37:38.713 --> 02:37:42.875]  And being Christians, we place the Bible as our sole authority of faith and practice.
[02:37:43.215 --> 02:37:55.300]  But I need you to help me to understand how you see Revelation 13, where it does say that all upon the earth will worship the beast, and he will have power over them.
[02:37:56.741 --> 02:38:01.203]  Do you think we can stop the New World Order, or we can just slow it down by prayer?
[02:38:01.223 --> 02:38:02.223]  Because it does say that
[02:38:02.671 --> 02:38:06.772]  He will overpower the saints and the power is given to him to control.
[02:38:06.832 --> 02:38:09.452]  Well, he will make war against the saints and overcome them.
[02:38:10.353 --> 02:38:10.573]  Right.
[02:38:11.593 --> 02:38:13.273]  And that's a particular passage.
[02:38:13.653 --> 02:38:19.494]  Then it gets into the greatest falling away ever right before, the greatest coming back during it.
[02:38:20.175 --> 02:38:23.255]  And it talks about all sorts of victories.
[02:38:23.295 --> 02:38:26.536]  So it's a fight to wake people up inside the system.
[02:38:27.036 --> 02:38:27.436]  Exactly.
[02:38:28.356 --> 02:38:29.997]  And that's why I tell everyone that I can.
[02:38:30.017 --> 02:38:31.057]  Do you...
[02:38:32.247 --> 02:38:37.971]  Do you feel that we're in the tribulation period now or we're almost into the tribulation period where it's three and a half years?
[02:38:39.132 --> 02:38:40.834]  I don't go there, sir.
[02:38:40.994 --> 02:38:45.637]  I have a news program and I don't care if the end of the world is tomorrow or a hundred years from now.
[02:38:45.657 --> 02:38:51.882]  I have a job to do fighting evil and exposing corruption and most people I know do nothing.
[02:38:52.555 --> 02:38:56.098]  But constantly just say, God's coming next week, and I don't have to worry about it.
[02:38:56.499 --> 02:39:02.845]  And preachers who say the end's next month, next year, they're never right, and then no one ever holds them to account.
[02:39:03.445 --> 02:39:09.811]  And most of them just say, lay down, George Bush is basically God, and it's just, I don't deal with it.
[02:39:10.171 --> 02:39:11.633]  I've got a job to fight evil.
[02:39:13.174 --> 02:39:15.376]  Duty is mine, consequences belong to God.
[02:39:15.396 --> 02:39:16.257]  I appreciate the call.
[02:39:19.312 --> 02:39:20.273]  It's an important question.
[02:39:20.313 --> 02:39:23.935]  I've already taken too many calls, and I'm accelerating through this as fast as I can.
[02:39:24.556 --> 02:39:26.037]  Let me get into the news real fast here.
[02:39:27.118 --> 02:39:28.519]  Retired colonel claims U.S.
[02:39:28.559 --> 02:39:30.680]  military operations are already underway in Iran.
[02:39:30.700 --> 02:39:32.461]  This is from Ross Story.
[02:39:33.642 --> 02:39:36.284]  During an interview on CNN Friday night, retired U.S.
[02:39:36.344 --> 02:39:39.666]  Air Force colonel Sam Gardner claimed that U.S.
[02:39:39.707 --> 02:39:41.988]  military operations are already underway inside Iran.
[02:39:42.529 --> 02:39:43.629]  Well, we knew that two years ago.
[02:39:45.069 --> 02:39:47.990]  I would say, and this may come as a shock, that I think the decision has been made.
[02:39:48.010 --> 02:39:49.491]  The military operations are already underway.
[02:39:50.391 --> 02:39:56.293]  Colonel Gardner told CNN International anchor Jim Clancy, and it goes on.
[02:39:57.673 --> 02:40:00.954]  Gardner, who... In fact, we have the clip.
[02:40:01.014 --> 02:40:02.375]  I should have sent this clip to you.
[02:40:03.995 --> 02:40:07.857]  Hey, go to prisonplanet.com, and it will say, Retired Colonel Claims U.S.
[02:40:07.877 --> 02:40:09.717]  Military Operations Already Underway.
[02:40:09.857 --> 02:40:14.479]  Click on the story, and then two paragraphs down, John, it says, Crooks and Liars Video Clip.
[02:40:16.053 --> 02:40:17.154]  Regardless, get it for tomorrow.
[02:40:17.914 --> 02:40:38.629]  And it goes on, Gardner, who designed a war game in November of 2004 for Atlantic Magazine, Will Iran Be Next?, which simulated preparations for an assault on Iran, also claimed that the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations, International Atomic Energy Agency, told him a few weeks ago that units who had attacked the Revolutionary Guard had been captured and confessed to working with the U.S.
[02:40:39.270 --> 02:40:43.953]  Well, yeah, almost three years ago they staged, remember, the attempted overthrow of the country.
[02:40:45.248 --> 02:40:47.729]  He said, quite frankly, yes, we know they are.
[02:40:48.609 --> 02:40:53.431]  We've captured some of their units, and they've confessed to working with the Americans, said the retired Air Force colonel.
[02:40:54.492 --> 02:40:58.893]  And it goes on with other reports of how special forces are there right now, and it goes on and on.
[02:40:59.614 --> 02:41:02.915]  And Cheney and Rumsfeld have both told Tim Downing Street.
[02:41:02.955 --> 02:41:06.296]  They've told CFR meeting in New York.
[02:41:06.336 --> 02:41:08.377]  It's all over the news that they're going to war with them.
[02:41:09.177 --> 02:41:09.838]  Can you believe it?
[02:41:12.539 --> 02:41:13.179]  Unbelievable.
[02:41:14.911 --> 02:41:18.733]  Cutter says OPEC can do nothing about high oil prices.
[02:41:18.773 --> 02:41:21.734]  Reuters, oil prices are too high and OPEC can do nothing to cool them.
[02:41:23.314 --> 02:41:24.435]  And it's just the way it is.
[02:41:24.475 --> 02:41:30.657]  Meanwhile, Exxon Chairman gets $400 million retirement package amid soaring gas prices.
[02:41:32.818 --> 02:41:36.739]  And they made a record $36 billion in Exxon alone.
[02:41:36.799 --> 02:41:38.840]  Every other major oil company posted record profits.
[02:41:38.860 --> 02:41:42.221]  But the thing is, folks, that is not free market.
[02:41:43.660 --> 02:41:44.600]  It's an oligopoly.
[02:41:44.661 --> 02:41:49.002]  It's a group of the major 12 oil companies, really the Big Ten, but there's two other medium-sized ones.
[02:41:49.962 --> 02:41:55.724]  The Big Ten sitting there staging events, keeping oil from flowing out of Iraq.
[02:41:57.145 --> 02:42:00.026]  They asked Saddam back in 1990 to stop overproducing.
[02:42:00.366 --> 02:42:02.587]  You see, people think they make more money off pumping more oil.
[02:42:02.627 --> 02:42:03.027]  No, no, no.
[02:42:03.347 --> 02:42:08.429]  They make more money off of not letting that oil flow.
[02:42:10.620 --> 02:42:13.743]  That's what they do over and over and over and over again.
[02:42:14.323 --> 02:42:20.048]  So people get all upset over the Exxon chairman retiring with $400 million, plus all of his stock worth hundreds of millions.
[02:42:20.689 --> 02:42:21.409]  That's nothing.
[02:42:22.971 --> 02:42:27.615]  I mean, $36 billion to the shareholders, which are very elite, some of the big shareholders.
[02:42:27.915 --> 02:42:29.436]  And that's one of the oil companies.
[02:42:29.476 --> 02:42:36.322]  The Rockefellers still have dominant controlling stock in eight of the original 12 oil companies.
[02:42:37.734 --> 02:42:39.015]  And you never hear about them in the news.
[02:42:39.295 --> 02:42:42.857]  A lot richer than Bill Gates, but their money's in all tax-free foundations.
[02:42:45.478 --> 02:42:48.399]  And the dollar's been devalued by 40-plus percent.
[02:42:48.559 --> 02:42:54.062]  And so that's why, one big reason you see oil going up, that only accounts for about half of the rise.
[02:42:54.983 --> 02:43:00.505]  And then you also see, again, this oligopoly manipulating the prices.
[02:43:00.525 --> 02:43:02.826]  We're just being raped because we're a bunch of idiots.
[02:43:02.886 --> 02:43:03.907]  I mean, this is how they see us.
[02:43:04.657 --> 02:43:09.360]  Gold storms a new 25-year high of going over $66 an ounce today.
[02:43:09.440 --> 02:43:13.062]  Silver surges to $13.33 an ounce.
[02:43:13.082 --> 02:43:14.203]  That's a huge increase.
[02:43:14.783 --> 02:43:16.084]  Oil, well over $70.
[02:43:18.205 --> 02:43:19.906]  Meanwhile, China's growth tops 10%.
[02:43:20.366 --> 02:43:22.347]  America's at 3.5% a year.
[02:43:22.828 --> 02:43:24.348]  That's lower than inflation.
[02:43:26.089 --> 02:43:27.070]  I know, you heard inflation's 3.3.
[02:43:27.370 --> 02:43:28.651]  It's a lot higher than that.
[02:43:29.770 --> 02:43:33.171]  So Bush gives you a small tax cut and then devalues the dollar by 44%.
[02:43:33.971 --> 02:43:39.993]  Would you rather not have the 5-6% tax cut and then have your money keep its value, or would you rather have a 44% loss?
[02:43:40.073 --> 02:43:46.555]  I mean, I guess if you take 6% out of that, it's a 38% loss.
[02:43:47.795 --> 02:43:49.456]  It's all smoke and mirrors.
[02:43:50.076 --> 02:43:53.537]  All right, here is a segment of Sheen on Kimmel.
[02:43:54.077 --> 02:43:55.477]  Then I've got some more comments on this.
[02:43:55.818 --> 02:43:56.978]  Last Friday night, here it is.
[02:43:57.018 --> 02:43:57.278]  Roll it.
[02:43:58.878 --> 02:44:07.781]  Our first guest tonight is not only a member of the world-famous Sheen family of actors, little known fact, also the genius behind the lucrative Afro-Sheen empire.
[02:44:07.861 --> 02:44:08.341]  That's right.
[02:44:08.361 --> 02:44:16.263]  You know him from movies like Platoon and Wall Street, and in addition to seeing him every week on Two and a Half Men, opening tonight you can see him in Scary Movie 4.
[02:44:16.363 --> 02:44:19.204]  Please welcome the indestructible Charlie Sheen!
[02:44:42.217 --> 02:44:42.958]  Thank you, Peter.
[02:44:43.018 --> 02:44:44.219]  Happy almost Easter.
[02:44:44.359 --> 02:44:45.140]  Hey, back at you.
[02:44:45.540 --> 02:44:46.821]  You had some interesting comments.
[02:44:46.841 --> 02:44:56.589]  You were on a radio show, and you talked about 9-11, and you have... Is it a theory, or you just don't believe the government account of what happened on 9-11?
[02:44:57.650 --> 02:44:58.410]  I just had questions.
[02:44:58.650 --> 02:44:58.830]  Yeah?
[02:44:58.850 --> 02:45:08.918]  I had a lot of questions, and the forum I chose to voice those questions in is the Alex Jones Radio Show, and just because he's a guy that I've been a fan of and followed for a lot of years, and...
[02:45:10.472 --> 02:45:11.212]  Yeah, I got attacked.
[02:45:11.232 --> 02:45:12.353]  I mean, there were a lot of head pieces.
[02:45:12.393 --> 02:45:13.513]  The reaction was pretty severe.
[02:45:13.533 --> 02:45:15.394]  Yeah, people get very mad when celebrities have an opinion.
[02:45:15.414 --> 02:45:16.155]  No, I understand.
[02:45:16.195 --> 02:45:16.535]  I understand.
[02:45:16.555 --> 02:45:17.775]  I know he's not qualified.
[02:45:17.815 --> 02:45:24.498]  He doesn't... You know, he's just... Who the hell is he to have an opinion about something so horrible?
[02:45:24.678 --> 02:45:33.542]  And, you know, it was sad because they didn't really take a look at any of the stuff I was asking them to look at, any of the evidence or any of the stuff that generated those questions, you know?
[02:45:34.083 --> 02:45:38.425]  And they said, oh, he's another tinfoil hat-wearing Hollywood clown, you know?
[02:45:38.445 --> 02:45:39.265]  And it's like the only...
[02:45:40.356 --> 02:45:48.704]  You know, I felt that the only real validation I needed was just being a tax-paying American that loves my country.
[02:45:49.125 --> 02:45:55.591]  Yeah, and you, I mean, it's just something that you wonder about and you would like to know more about, I assume.
[02:45:55.711 --> 02:45:55.891]  Sure.
[02:45:55.911 --> 02:45:57.453]  And do you study the tapes?
[02:45:57.993 --> 02:46:03.118]  I've done a lot of research, and it's not just me, it's the people that have come before me, the experts and the...
[02:46:04.508 --> 02:46:08.809]  The engineers and the physicists and the scientists and the scholars that raised a lot of these things.
[02:46:08.849 --> 02:46:12.450]  And I took a look at their research and said, yeah, it doesn't add up.
[02:46:12.570 --> 02:46:13.550]  A lot of it doesn't add up.
[02:46:13.630 --> 02:46:15.130]  Hence these questions.
[02:46:16.091 --> 02:46:16.771]  There's two areas.
[02:46:16.791 --> 02:46:19.812]  There's Building 7 and there's the five frames from the Pentagon.
[02:46:20.072 --> 02:46:20.692]  Don't listen to me.
[02:46:20.952 --> 02:46:21.772]  Do your own research.
[02:46:21.852 --> 02:46:30.614]  But I think that what happened to a time in this country when we were entitled, when we had a constitutional and a God-given right to be curious about things that
[02:46:31.309 --> 02:46:32.150]  That didn't make sense.
[02:46:32.210 --> 02:46:32.671]  That's all it was.
[02:46:32.691 --> 02:46:34.393]  Because we have a lot of cable shows now.
[02:46:34.413 --> 02:46:34.973]  Thank you.
[02:46:35.194 --> 02:46:36.755]  And they need stuff to be mad about.
[02:46:36.896 --> 02:46:41.321]  So, you know, stuff like this is like, oh boy, we could yell about this for an entire week.
[02:46:41.541 --> 02:46:45.545]  And plus, with your dad being the president and all, it puts a lot of the focus on it.
[02:46:45.565 --> 02:46:46.066]  That's true.
[02:46:46.246 --> 02:46:48.168]  Yeah, I should have conferred with him before I came out publicly.
[02:46:49.552 --> 02:47:02.877]  Now, by the time several news publications, newspapers and blogs and entertainment sites got a hold of it, they said, the crowd didn't like him, the American people disagree with him, he basically backpedaled, Charlie Sheen's very sorry now.
[02:47:03.378 --> 02:47:11.561]  Didn't say any of that, laid his case out brilliantly, did a good job, the people clapped and supported him, you didn't hear any boos there, did you?
[02:47:12.341 --> 02:47:19.204]  Meanwhile, Dick Cheney has 80% of people booing him when he throws out the first pitch and the media spins that into the people loving him.
[02:47:20.279 --> 02:47:21.139]  But you didn't hear that.
[02:47:21.399 --> 02:47:22.379]  But the media spins you.
[02:47:22.500 --> 02:47:25.100]  Then we put that article out late Friday night.
[02:47:25.380 --> 02:47:26.981]  Normally it would be up on Google within a day.
[02:47:28.201 --> 02:47:36.863]  Other reports that have posted our report are on Google, but our sites, prisonplanet.com and infowars.com, aren't on Google Web or Google News, even though we're a Google News affiliate.
[02:47:38.003 --> 02:47:39.523]  Specifically blocking us again.
[02:47:39.563 --> 02:47:40.544]  We've caught them red-handed.
[02:47:40.864 --> 02:47:43.024]  We've got that report up on infowars.com.
[02:47:43.044 --> 02:47:45.805]  Google caught censoring prison planet Charlie Sheen 911 coverage again.
[02:47:48.081 --> 02:47:53.075]  And another one, media spins Sheen's comments as minority view despite polls.
[02:47:53.760 --> 02:47:55.241]  And then they go, well, those aren't scientific polls.
[02:47:55.301 --> 02:47:59.423]  No, there are major scientific polls that show the majority have this view, two Zogbys.
[02:48:00.063 --> 02:48:06.667]  And then on top of it, you go to the blogs of newspapers where they're attacking Sheen, and in some cases, 98% are for Sheen.
[02:48:06.707 --> 02:48:08.087]  On average, it's about 80-something percent.
[02:48:08.107 --> 02:48:13.130]  I mean, you'll read like 50 posts out of hundreds and hundreds, and maybe one or two are against Sheen.
[02:48:13.590 --> 02:48:14.711]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[02:48:14.811 --> 02:48:16.792]  So, major spin there.
[02:48:16.912 --> 02:48:18.093]  Please help us counter that.
[02:48:18.133 --> 02:48:18.793]  Get these stories.
[02:48:19.253 --> 02:48:25.615]  Get them out to everyone and ask them what they're up to over there at Google because they've been caught doing this in China and other countries.
[02:48:26.035 --> 02:48:27.495]  We've already caught them doing it to us once.
[02:48:27.515 --> 02:48:28.156]  There's no doubt in it.
[02:48:28.176 --> 02:48:29.256]  We know how the system works.
[02:48:29.796 --> 02:48:30.636]  They're blocking us.
[02:48:30.676 --> 02:48:32.617]  They've delisted this specific story.
[02:48:33.297 --> 02:48:38.078]  We can write a little nothing story and it gets listed in a day on Google because Google's based on hits.
[02:48:38.578 --> 02:48:40.539]  How many visitors you get and we get a lot of visitors.
[02:48:43.829 --> 02:48:50.676]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:48:50.976 --> 02:48:52.358]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:52.538 --> 02:48:54.740]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:54.920 --> 02:48:57.002]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:57.263 --> 02:49:02.227]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:02.548 --> 02:49:06.572]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:06.812 --> 02:49:08.594]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:49:08.674 --> 02:49:19.322]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and pliable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:49:19.462 --> 02:49:21.364]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:49:21.584 --> 02:49:25.447]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.

[02:51:45.022 --> 02:51:50.183]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:50.843 --> 02:51:53.164]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:51:55.103 --> 02:51:56.765]  This is what the neocons do.
[02:51:56.905 --> 02:52:08.780]  Once they get caught, once they know conservatives are angry at them and mad at them, they'll then come out and say, oh, it's Bush that's doing it, or he just didn't understand, or Bush better watch it, he's going to do a better job in the future.
[02:52:09.261 --> 02:52:12.245]  Oh, the American people demand something be done about the borders.
[02:52:14.116 --> 02:52:19.519]  And then their answer is a blanket amnesty program, but renaming it, calling it a guest worker program.
[02:52:19.879 --> 02:52:21.320]  The American people have gotten tough.
[02:52:21.360 --> 02:52:23.361]  They demand a guest worker program from Bush.
[02:52:23.801 --> 02:52:26.802]  Well, that's exactly what Bush is proposing, and that's not what we want or need.
[02:52:27.803 --> 02:52:30.244]  And Newt Gingrich is out saying that.
[02:52:30.744 --> 02:52:33.546]  His job was to destroy the Republican Revolution in 1994.
[02:52:34.126 --> 02:52:36.547]  Gingrich warns Republicans want change.
[02:52:36.567 --> 02:52:37.508]  He's a big globalist.
[02:52:38.516 --> 02:52:44.217]  I think they're very serious danger of having a very bad election this fall, Gingrich said on Fox News Sunday.
[02:52:44.237 --> 02:52:46.917]  He said the American people are mad at Republicans.
[02:52:48.178 --> 02:52:50.398]  And the Democrats are bought and paid for by the same people.
[02:52:51.778 --> 02:52:59.980]  Meanwhile, Bush's new chief of staff signals shake-up this out of the AP, signaling a possible shake-up among President Bush's senior advisors.
[02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:07.321]  The White House chief of staff told top presidential aides Monday to expect changes that refresh and re-energize the term.
[02:53:07.481 --> 02:53:07.621]  He...
[02:53:08.726 --> 02:53:12.050]  Invited anyone who was thinking of leaving before the year's end to do so now.
[02:53:14.913 --> 02:53:19.098]  And that's Mr. Bolton who took over the top staff job late Friday.
[02:53:19.559 --> 02:53:24.124]  So now basically the entire White House staff has dual citizenship.
[02:53:24.144 --> 02:53:25.826]  It just gets crazier and crazier.
[02:53:26.667 --> 02:53:27.829]  And it just goes on and on.
[02:53:29.184 --> 02:53:38.889]  Meanwhile, another Zogby poll came out, and the majority of Americans have now grown that want to control the border and are angry about these demonstrations, as I told you two weeks ago.
[02:53:39.469 --> 02:53:40.709]  Clearly backfired.
[02:53:41.170 --> 02:53:45.692]  Bush's slash Fox's PR firmly hired out of Dallas.
[02:53:48.120 --> 02:53:50.241]  Organize these whole things with the media.
[02:53:51.062 --> 02:53:52.442]  You can't unring that bell.
[02:53:52.482 --> 02:53:54.023]  Everybody saw the Mexican flags.
[02:53:54.423 --> 02:54:01.606]  You ordered people in emails to your activist controllers, your rent-a-mob, not to do that, but they didn't follow orders.
[02:54:02.387 --> 02:54:09.410]  Everybody saw the truth, including the majority of Hispanic Americans who love this country and are very upset about what's happening.
[02:54:10.050 --> 02:54:13.532]  So it didn't work, and it's not going to work.
[02:54:16.033 --> 02:54:17.754]  But back to the oil situation.
[02:54:18.535 --> 02:54:25.680]  They're going to make the whipping boy be the outgoing Exxon chief getting $400 million retirement package.
[02:54:27.001 --> 02:54:30.664]  Meanwhile, you're out there paying on average over $3 a gallon now in this nation.
[02:54:30.684 --> 02:54:34.087]  I mean, in Texas, we're right by the refineries.
[02:54:34.107 --> 02:54:35.008]  We're paying $2.89, $2.95 for 87 octane.
[02:54:35.048 --> 02:54:36.789]  Three-something for premiums.
[02:54:43.129 --> 02:54:45.730]  And it's all because they're raping the daylights out of us.
[02:54:45.750 --> 02:54:46.490]  That's half of us.
[02:54:47.930 --> 02:54:50.751]  Because you've got really a monopoly going just under different brand names.
[02:54:51.151 --> 02:54:53.671]  And the other part of the equation is the dollar has plunged in value.
[02:54:53.951 --> 02:54:55.132]  And just look at gold.
[02:54:55.912 --> 02:54:57.492]  At over $606 an ounce.
[02:54:57.692 --> 02:55:02.253]  I remember when I was buying it for $250 an ounce five years ago.
[02:55:03.554 --> 02:55:06.694]  And the little bit of gold I've bought, I ain't showing it even though it's now hit $600.
[02:55:07.114 --> 02:55:07.434]  Plus, because...
[02:55:10.640 --> 02:55:17.323]  All I'll get is fiat currency back that isn't even worth the paper it's written on and being devalued more and more daily.
[02:55:18.923 --> 02:55:26.686]  I would encourage listeners to take some of those fiat currency notes and to get some of my videos, which are the most valuable material of all.
[02:55:26.847 --> 02:55:27.507]  Information.
[02:55:27.667 --> 02:55:28.487]  Knowledge is power.

[02:55:41.158 --> 02:55:41.638]  Get them all.
