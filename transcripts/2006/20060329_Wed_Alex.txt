[00:00:05.902 --> 00:00:06.542]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.202 --> 00:00:08.263]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.983 --> 00:00:10.084]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:11.564]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.305 --> 00:00:13.225]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:17.527]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.048 --> 00:00:22.169]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.451 --> 00:00:29.333]  Well, I apologize to all our affiliates out there.
[00:00:29.753 --> 00:00:31.474]  We moved the network this weekend and
[00:00:33.217 --> 00:00:34.819]  Well, it's a nice new facility.
[00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.262]  I'm down here in Austin, Texas, but they're up there in Minnesota, so it took a few more days.
[00:00:38.422 --> 00:00:40.343]  We never went down, we've just been doing rebroadcasts.
[00:00:40.363 --> 00:00:53.295]  It's been one of the biggest news cycles ever, not just for this broadcast, not just for this show, but in the nation with the rampaging, fit-throwing, tantrum-throwing illegal aliens all over the country.
[00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:03.053]  And at the same time, the big Charlie Sheen story really developing and a lot of new things that have happened there that we'll be going over as well.
[00:01:03.193 --> 00:01:07.654]  We also have Mr. Card, the White House Chief of Staff, resigning.
[00:01:07.694 --> 00:01:14.596]  We'll talk about what may be behind that sudden resignation yesterday.
[00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:17.057]  Well, I guess on Monday now.
[00:01:17.997 --> 00:01:23.139]  So it is all coming up here in the next three hours.
[00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:28.444]  And we're not on the normal ISDN lines, because the phone company did not hook those up correctly.
[00:01:28.484 --> 00:01:35.828]  I'm on this Internet Skype system, connecting through to the network, so they hope all will run smoothly.
[00:01:36.288 --> 00:01:43.091]  We have, coming up later, one of the CNN pieces, the second CNN piece that I was on Friday, that many of you have not had a chance to hear.
[00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:44.832]  We'll be airing that, and I'll be commenting on it.
[00:01:45.212 --> 00:01:49.074]  Also, some of the other guests they had on the show, who were...
[00:01:50.118 --> 00:01:55.043]  Commenting after I had come on talking about the dictatorship that we are under in America.
[00:01:55.063 --> 00:01:59.006]  And then, of course, yesterday Ed Asner was supposed to be on CNN.
[00:02:02.093 --> 00:02:02.914]  We're good to go.
[00:02:21.113 --> 00:02:33.899]  Despite the fact that that show got record ratings, record emails, and 53 plus thousand people, 53 plus thousand people voted in that online poll.
[00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:38.881]  The poll asking, do you believe, Charlie Sheen, that the government is covering up what really happened on 9-11?
[00:02:41.423 --> 00:02:49.330]  And, of course, I was stating on the broadcast that the government was involved in the attacks, and then we had 83% when the poll closed.
[00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.371]  It hit an all-time high of 86%.
[00:02:51.572 --> 00:02:59.940]  But when it closed, 83% believed that the government was covering up what happened on 9-11.
[00:03:02.455 --> 00:03:09.899]  And of course, the coverage has continued at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com throughout the weekend and for the last two days.
[00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:16.843]  But we're live right now, the 29th day of March, on this live Wednesday edition.
[00:03:18.284 --> 00:03:21.545]  And we're going to be here throughout the broadcast covering the news.
[00:03:21.566 --> 00:03:29.470]  You know, I already knew this, and that's why the article that I conferred with Paul Watson on, that we put together yesterday...
[00:03:30.663 --> 00:03:35.968]  Headline, Immigration protests cover for racist ethnic cleansing movement.
[00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:40.252]  Aslan and Mexican clan groups rejoice at start of La Reconquista.
[00:03:40.933 --> 00:03:52.304]  When we wrote this article, I guess about a day ago, it had not yet come out in the mainstream news that the Spanish-speaking media were the ones pushing the La Reconquista.
[00:03:53.631 --> 00:04:07.099]  I turned the television on this weekend several times with my wife in bed late at night, and we watched the local Spanish TV station, and we watched the national Spanish TV station, and my wife, of course, speaks Spanish.
[00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:13.043]  She lived, I guess, four years in Madrid when her father was with the Agriculture Department, so she speaks fluent Spanish.
[00:04:13.863 --> 00:04:16.585]  But I didn't even need to know what they were saying to see it.
[00:04:16.625 --> 00:04:17.386]  It was vicious.
[00:04:18.526 --> 00:04:19.507]  There'd be 90-plus...
[00:04:21.826 --> 00:04:24.207]  Foreign flags to every American flag.
[00:04:24.767 --> 00:04:29.709]  They were running around screaming or taking over and all whites must leave or die.
[00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:32.370]  And the signs were all visible.
[00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:33.650]  This is our country.
[00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.551]  This is our continent.
[00:04:34.591 --> 00:04:35.151]  Not yours.
[00:04:35.231 --> 00:04:35.611]  Get out.
[00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:36.572]  We're going to get you.
[00:04:38.112 --> 00:04:39.072]  All of that was there.
[00:04:39.092 --> 00:04:43.894]  Then you'd tune into CNN and they'd show the American flags up close, camera shots.
[00:04:44.274 --> 00:04:45.715]  Oh, they love America.
[00:04:46.095 --> 00:04:46.715]  Freedom.
[00:04:47.716 --> 00:04:48.236]  Goodness.
[00:04:49.096 --> 00:04:49.676]  Happiness.
[00:04:50.537 --> 00:04:51.137]  Lovingness.
[00:04:51.906 --> 00:04:53.227]  We're so good.
[00:04:54.147 --> 00:04:58.169]  And of course, there have been racial attacks all over the country as well, being dutifully covered up by the media.
[00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.511]  We'll break it all down when we get back.
[00:05:01.531 --> 00:05:02.092]  Let me understand.
[00:05:02.792 --> 00:05:05.633]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.894 --> 00:05:06.594]  Hello, my friends.
[00:05:06.694 --> 00:05:07.474]  Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.835 --> 00:05:12.517]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.837 --> 00:05:19.581]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.901 --> 00:05:21.863]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:22.083 --> 00:05:24.925]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:25.025 --> 00:05:29.689]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:34.292]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.533 --> 00:05:41.758]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:44.420]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:05:44.601 --> 00:05:46.322]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[00:05:46.442 --> 00:05:52.470]  1-888-253-3139 Or visit Infowars.com and the secure shopping cart.
[00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.895]  That's Infowars.com or 888-253-3139 Or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:03.191 --> 00:06:03.631]  We're good to go.
[00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.831]  We're good to go.
[00:06:53.761 --> 00:06:54.764]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:06:54.784 --> 00:06:56.407]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:03.348 --> 00:07:05.929]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.251]  When was the last time you used Pure Soap?
[00:07:08.531 --> 00:07:18.636]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[00:07:18.936 --> 00:07:21.278]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.
[00:07:21.458 --> 00:07:25.540]  There's a 100% unconditional guarantee on all their wonderful products.
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:31.123]  They're all natural, they're triple concentrated, they're factory direct, factory owned and operated.
[00:07:50.626 --> 00:07:51.407]  I mean, it's locked up now?
[00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:18.644]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:18.704 --> 00:08:21.086]  We're back live here with you today.
[00:08:21.106 --> 00:08:24.028]  The lustrous Genesis Communications.
[00:08:24.048 --> 00:08:25.509]  Boy, isn't it fun?
[00:08:25.589 --> 00:08:29.873]  And the country is imploding all around us.
[00:08:44.025 --> 00:08:46.010]  The country is falling apart all around us.
[00:08:46.812 --> 00:08:53.429]  The Spanish TV and radio and print is a perfect takeover operation because the average American doesn't speak Spanish.
[00:08:54.099 --> 00:08:56.640]  And they don't hear the TV and radio saying, this is Mexico.
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.460]  We're taking over.
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.700]  We're going to force you out.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.420]  We're going to kill you.
[00:09:01.481 --> 00:09:03.201]  But it is now being picked up.
[00:09:03.221 --> 00:09:08.462]  Associated Press, Spanish media organized nationwide mass protests.
[00:09:08.542 --> 00:09:09.883]  The marching orders were clear.
[00:09:10.423 --> 00:09:12.363]  Carry American flags and pack the kids.
[00:09:12.763 --> 00:09:15.984]  Pack up your trash and wear white for peace and for effect.
[00:09:16.607 --> 00:09:21.651]  And then you read it and it's all positive about how much they love America and how good it is.
[00:09:22.091 --> 00:09:25.134]  But you see, over the weekend, I've been chomping at the bit to be able to talk to you.
[00:09:26.395 --> 00:09:30.258]  Unfortunately, we weren't able to because of things going on, moving the network around and stuff.
[00:09:31.999 --> 00:09:35.002]  And I sat there and watched the Spanish television.
[00:09:35.462 --> 00:09:38.224]  And it was, we're taking over America, ha ha ha.
[00:09:39.185 --> 00:09:42.908]  And of course, most of the Spanish media is owned by big New York banks.
[00:09:43.687 --> 00:09:51.553]  And it's even been in the major California papers that 600 plus, almost 700 billboards were bought last year saying that L.A.
[00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:52.334]  is Mexico.
[00:09:52.374 --> 00:09:55.636]  They crossed out California and put Mexico on the billboards.
[00:09:55.936 --> 00:09:57.197]  And of course, white guys own that.
[00:09:57.217 --> 00:10:05.964]  It's all part of destroying America, bringing us down into the Pan-American Union.
[00:10:07.385 --> 00:10:10.167]  And so that is what's happened now.
[00:10:11.579 --> 00:10:14.340]  And I want everybody to know that I will be back in the near future.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.941]  We're going to go to rebroadcast later here.
[00:10:15.961 --> 00:10:21.363]  And I want you to know that Genesis again has four feeds and all these satellites and they move this weekend.
[00:10:22.263 --> 00:10:30.126]  We've been up with three feeds and it's complex to have us hooked up with them up in Minnesota and me down here in Texas.
[00:10:31.127 --> 00:10:38.329]  And I guess I'll just write some articles for you and put them up on the website to give you my analysis of what's really going on so we can communicate.
[00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:39.610]  That's probably the best way to
[00:10:40.154 --> 00:10:42.076]  Best way for me to handle things from here on out.
[00:10:42.797 --> 00:10:56.052]  Had some more Hollywood stars lined up on the show for you, but that'll be coming up in the future, too, as we fight the New World Order, as we expose 9-11, as we try to defend this republic.
[00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.070]  From enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:00.151]  You know, I have nothing against all illegal aliens.
[00:11:00.171 --> 00:11:02.611]  I have nothing against Hispanic people in this country.
[00:11:03.151 --> 00:11:07.972]  I'm just one of these bleeding heart, you know, dumb white people that grew up thinking we were all supposed to live in peace together.
[00:11:08.012 --> 00:11:14.233]  And meanwhile, the government was telling us through the media to be all laid down and be stupid and be guilty and act like a bunch of idiots.
[00:11:14.273 --> 00:11:18.314]  And meanwhile, the very same corporations own the Spanish media saying, take over America.
[00:11:18.574 --> 00:11:19.614]  Bring down America.
[00:11:20.074 --> 00:11:24.075]  And again, just in L.A., 600 plus billboards saying that and
[00:11:25.034 --> 00:11:29.957]  They organize this whole thing and there are millions of people that want to come here.
[00:11:29.977 --> 00:11:31.677]  There are six and a half billion people now.
[00:11:32.198 --> 00:11:35.119]  Latin America's population is doubling every 45 years.
[00:11:35.219 --> 00:11:36.900]  Mexico's doubling every 30 years.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.021]  They're the fastest growing population.
[00:11:39.482 --> 00:11:47.866]  And they're taught from birth by the Spanish speaking media, by the Mexican government that America belongs to Mexico.
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.842]  And they have been taught that America needs to go down.
[00:11:53.362 --> 00:11:57.003]  And the Ford Foundation and the Republican and Democratic parties are funding all of this.
[00:11:57.263 --> 00:11:58.264]  And I have all the documents.
[00:11:58.284 --> 00:12:07.147]  I mean, listen, I go out to these Mexican Independence Day parades here in Austin, and masses of people are wearing shirts that say the plan of San Diego.
[00:12:08.307 --> 00:12:10.968]  And then a UT historian says, go look that up, Alex.
[00:12:10.988 --> 00:12:13.629]  And I go look it up, and it's on Spanish websites.
[00:12:13.689 --> 00:12:17.991]  It's on the UT history department.
[00:12:18.607 --> 00:12:20.488]  Website, it's everywhere.
[00:12:21.169 --> 00:12:26.452]  That America is going down and that all whites above the age of 16 will be murdered.
[00:12:27.592 --> 00:12:32.135]  And I just sit here watching millions of people in the streets saying the exact same thing.
[00:12:32.175 --> 00:12:33.196]  We're going to murder you.
[00:12:33.276 --> 00:12:34.297]  We're going to kill you.
[00:12:34.377 --> 00:12:35.537]  We can't wait to kill you.
[00:12:36.358 --> 00:12:39.460]  And I know that our media is owned by the same people.
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.061]  And it's just really sad.
[00:12:42.481 --> 00:12:43.242]  It's really painful.
[00:12:44.122 --> 00:12:45.602]  And it's really, really upsetting.
[00:12:45.642 --> 00:12:52.904]  Now understand, the same corporations control the predominant Spanish media, the Latino media that is doing this.
[00:12:54.604 --> 00:12:57.705]  And literally, it is admitted that they get their marching orders.
[00:12:58.145 --> 00:13:07.947]  We have Mexican radio stations here in Austin, owned with big neocon financing, that are openly called the invasion, the rebel, the invader.
[00:13:08.007 --> 00:13:09.188]  I mean, all over the state.
[00:13:09.468 --> 00:13:10.568]  It's all over California.
[00:13:11.144 --> 00:13:14.969]  And I tune in with my Spanish-speaking friends, and I go, oh my gosh, Alex, you can only hear this.
[00:13:15.389 --> 00:13:16.391]  And my wife hears it.
[00:13:17.192 --> 00:13:18.934]  And she's able to hear what they're saying.
[00:13:19.134 --> 00:13:21.096]  And again, this is the perfect takeover.
[00:13:21.397 --> 00:13:29.327]  Wouldn't it be perfect to take a country over, you can communicate, no one knows what you're saying, you've got your own code, or your own language, and you've got all these...
[00:13:30.106 --> 00:13:37.170]  Language, stupid, liberal blacks and whites and others and liberal Hispanics who are just buying into all of this.
[00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:39.251]  We're seeing our dollar plunge.
[00:13:39.291 --> 00:13:42.372]  We're seeing the value of our currency plunge.
[00:13:42.893 --> 00:13:46.334]  We're seeing this whole nation just fall apart in front of us.
[00:13:47.855 --> 00:13:50.216]  And I really can't say it any other way.
[00:13:51.317 --> 00:13:52.757]  And it tears my guts out.
[00:13:52.978 --> 00:13:57.840]  I looked at hundreds of photos this weekend and yesterday and, of course, on Monday.
[00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.601]  I spent hours researching this
[00:14:00.624 --> 00:14:14.421]  And you watch Spanish media, literally, you'll see, I was trying to count them, 90 foreign flags, 50 will be Mexican or so, a few dozen Venezuelan, Guatemalan, Nicaraguan, Panamanian, even Chilean.
[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:16.641]  You will see it all.
[00:14:16.781 --> 00:14:18.183]  Argentinian.
[00:14:18.764 --> 00:14:33.162]  You will see all these flags, mainly Mexican, and you'll see a few big flags up front with the smart labor unions and the reconquista leaders themselves who are leading it, smiling and laughing, and CNN and Fox and others will predominantly...
[00:14:33.642 --> 00:14:37.184]  Just zoom in on the three or four big American flags up front.
[00:14:37.604 --> 00:14:42.387]  And man, you watch the Spanish TV, it is a sea of Mexican flags.
[00:14:42.447 --> 00:14:46.469]  And they are screaming, they are yelling, they've got signs that show the U.S.
[00:14:46.509 --> 00:14:49.770]  cut in half, or roughly 40% of it lopped off.
[00:14:49.971 --> 00:14:53.472]  Aslan, by the way, their maps a few years ago just showed seven states.
[00:14:53.913 --> 00:14:57.314]  Now they're showing upwards of 10 to 12 states on different maps.
[00:14:58.575 --> 00:14:59.696]  And I'm looking at it right here.
[00:14:59.716 --> 00:15:01.937]  I'm looking at an Aslan map.
[00:15:01.977 --> 00:15:02.397]  Let me find it.
[00:15:03.595 --> 00:15:13.104]  Looking at the Aslan map, now they want Wyoming, they want Utah, they want Oregon, they want Washington State, they want California.
[00:15:13.124 --> 00:15:14.866]  This is their official map.
[00:15:15.026 --> 00:15:28.059]  They want Nevada, they want Phoenix, excuse me, they want Arizona, they want New Mexico, they want Colorado, they want Kansas, they want Oklahoma, they want Texas.
[00:15:29.864 --> 00:15:31.465]  They want it all, and they want it now.
[00:15:32.026 --> 00:15:37.169]  And you go to the Aslan official websites, and it says, Jews and whites are the devil.
[00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:38.410]  You will be dealt with.
[00:15:38.731 --> 00:15:39.912]  You will be driven out.
[00:15:40.392 --> 00:15:42.433]  If you do not submit, you will die.
[00:15:43.214 --> 00:15:54.022]  And then, in one case, we researched it in the 678 giant full-color billboards in L.A.
[00:15:54.102 --> 00:15:54.582]  last year.
[00:15:54.602 --> 00:15:56.524]  This is just one example that have
[00:15:57.668 --> 00:16:03.550]  It says Los Angeles, and California's crossed out, Mexico's next to it, Channel 62.
[00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.990]  Guess who owns this?
[00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:12.072]  Guess who owns one of the biggest Spanish-speaking networks in the country?
[00:16:12.312 --> 00:16:13.593]  He's a Jewish man.
[00:16:14.973 --> 00:16:20.655]  And then you go to the websites of the guests they have on these TV stations, and they're saying, we're going to get the Jews.
[00:16:23.015 --> 00:16:27.980]  And then I went and I looked up who owns one of the big Spanish-speaking chains here in Texas.
[00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:31.944]  It's a white guy up in Dallas.
[00:16:32.225 --> 00:16:34.106]  It's a guy with an English last name.
[00:16:34.227 --> 00:16:42.675]  I mean, it's old white men, folks, old white men, and they're trying to destabilize this country, and it makes me sick.
[00:16:42.975 --> 00:16:46.259]  Listen, we've got links to the Osloan websites where they say,
[00:16:47.154 --> 00:17:01.342]  I mean, can you imagine if a group of blacks was marching in mass or if a group of whites was marching in mass saying they're going to get all the whites or get all the Mexicans or get all the... And I sit here wanting to live in peace.
[00:17:01.883 --> 00:17:03.043]  I'm 32 years old.
[00:17:03.283 --> 00:17:11.368]  I was raised to be friendly to everybody, that everybody was friends, that whites had been bad in the past.
[00:17:11.788 --> 00:17:14.030]  All this bleeding heart garbage.
[00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:16.231]  Listen, I haven't done anything to anybody.
[00:17:16.833 --> 00:17:21.056]  I just care about my family and care about freedom and care about sovereignty of this country.
[00:17:21.077 --> 00:17:23.979]  And I'm not going to be guilted into going along with people.
[00:17:24.759 --> 00:17:26.000]  Listen, I'm not joking.
[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:37.009]  Do you understand that it is the equivalent of an invading army with their own radio and TV, owned by our own corporations, saying they're going to bring America down?
[00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:39.411]  Do you realize that?
[00:17:40.339 --> 00:17:42.299]  I am nauseated right now.
[00:17:42.579 --> 00:17:47.480]  I am, I am literally, last night I was literally nauseous.
[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:51.721]  And I was nauseous at the fact that I couldn't get on air to talk about this in the last two days.
[00:17:52.021 --> 00:17:55.402]  And I apologize for that, but the network's been working as hard as it can to move things.
[00:17:55.482 --> 00:17:57.362]  I knew it would be a lot harder than what they thought.
[00:17:57.382 --> 00:18:02.223]  With all those feeds and all that stuff and all the internet and all the satellites and all the craziness.
[00:18:02.263 --> 00:18:03.323]  But at least we never went down.
[00:18:03.343 --> 00:18:04.783]  We've been doing refeeds.
[00:18:04.983 --> 00:18:07.544]  And we'll be here, you know, the leader in alternative information.
[00:18:07.564 --> 00:18:09.564]  And I want to thank all of our affiliates and everybody else
[00:18:10.496 --> 00:18:22.908]  And as we try to work all this out, I just... And, of course, we put in our article yesterday that it was Spanish media giving the orders.
[00:18:24.089 --> 00:18:26.571]  We didn't need to see it in the AP today to know that.
[00:18:27.352 --> 00:18:28.913]  It's now admitted in the Associated Press.
[00:18:29.874 --> 00:18:31.095]  I don't need them to tell me.
[00:18:31.155 --> 00:18:32.096]  I can tune in and see it.
[00:18:32.116 --> 00:18:32.977]  I mean, it is scary.
[00:18:34.326 --> 00:18:51.556]  It'd be kind of like if we were Poland and Nazi Germany back in the late 1930s bordered us, and it'd be like if Hitler came in and bought radio and TV stations and was saying in German so the Poles couldn't understand it, we're taking over, we're going to drive you out, we're going to kill you.
[00:18:51.576 --> 00:18:53.017]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:18:53.297 --> 00:18:54.458]  We are the master race.
[00:18:54.518 --> 00:18:59.961]  Oh, by the way, I mean, our mayor, Gus Garcia, when he was in office still four years ago, I have it on videotape.
[00:19:00.001 --> 00:19:02.002]  I've been meaning to make an immigration poll, never got around to it.
[00:19:02.728 --> 00:19:03.428]  I played it on TV.
[00:19:03.468 --> 00:19:06.149]  It's in one of my weekly reports on presentplanet.tv.
[00:19:07.249 --> 00:19:13.311]  He got up, and he had a city proclamation with the Metro La Raza La Reconquista crowd.
[00:19:15.972 --> 00:19:22.513]  And he openly said, he read the proclamation, and he said, we are the mythical god race.
[00:19:23.574 --> 00:19:32.076]  And they had the Aztecs get up in their Aztec outfits, and they said, the flying saucers landed, the flying saucers aliens inbred with us, this is the mayor.
[00:19:32.975 --> 00:19:33.415]  You understand?
[00:19:34.356 --> 00:19:42.462]  And we are the God race, and then Daryl Slusher, still a member of the council at that time, he said, I agree, it is the supreme race.
[00:19:43.122 --> 00:19:53.329]  And they all said amen to that, and there was a clapping and a chanting, and people running around in Aztec outfits, and I was hearing that there was a superior race, and that I had to step aside.
[00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:59.113]  And there was the white city councilman there with the... By the way, Gus Garcia says he wants to be buried in Mexico.
[00:19:59.153 --> 00:20:00.014]  He says he's a Mexican.
[00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:04.033]  Jay Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:20:04.493 --> 00:20:11.659]  Did you know that one of the 45 points of international communism to capture America was to gain control of one or both political parties?
[00:20:12.521 --> 00:20:25.694]  Have you noticed that it doesn't matter which political party, Republican or Democrat, takes office, we continue in the same direction of losing our freedoms and ultimately our national sovereignty to the United Nations, which is a communist organization.
[00:20:26.515 --> 00:20:28.016]  The handwriting is on the wall.

[00:21:06.299 --> 00:21:09.561]  Currency devaluation, inflation, one and the same.
[00:21:10.301 --> 00:21:14.283]  If you have deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:21:20.546 --> 00:21:23.668]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:21:23.928 --> 00:21:25.769]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:21:25.849 --> 00:21:28.851]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:21:29.392 --> 00:21:31.613]  Here is reality.
[00:21:31.973 --> 00:21:35.576]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:21:36.056 --> 00:21:39.718]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:21:40.279 --> 00:21:42.740]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[00:21:44.457 --> 00:21:44.898]  We're good to go.
[00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:01.711]  Hello, folks.

[00:23:56.698 --> 00:24:07.223]  888-216-2461 Waging War on Corruption Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[00:24:21.272 --> 00:24:22.593]  Alright, here, back live.
[00:24:23.194 --> 00:24:25.215]  Literally doing this broadcast with bailing wire.
[00:24:25.235 --> 00:24:27.998]  It's like I'm an astronaut orbiting the planet or something.
[00:24:28.558 --> 00:24:31.881]  Yes, I'm doing this broadcast from low Earth orbit, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:33.162 --> 00:24:34.523]  Hooked into the Genesis Network.
[00:24:34.543 --> 00:24:37.045]  We'll get the wrinkles ironed out here in the next few days.
[00:24:37.846 --> 00:24:40.688]  Let me just read what Paul Watson predominantly wrote.
[00:24:40.848 --> 00:24:43.010]  And Paul, I hope you're listening, because I want you to take my notes.
[00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:43.731]  I'm going over here.
[00:24:43.751 --> 00:24:48.515]  I want to write another article today, confer with you, and we'll put one together in more detail.
[00:24:49.565 --> 00:24:53.307]  Immigration protests cover for racist ethnic cleansing movement.
[00:24:53.767 --> 00:24:57.289]  Aslan and Mexican clan groups rejoice at start of La Reconquista.
[00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:11.177]  At the height of last year's French riots, VASDA Aslan leader Ernesto Cifrengos stated that similar scenes of chaos would be witnessed on the streets of America.
[00:25:11.197 --> 00:25:12.298]  You can go to their site and read it.
[00:25:13.177 --> 00:25:20.124]  As reports of violence began to filter through, a deliberately fomented race war, hiding behind an immigration debate, creeps ever closer.
[00:25:21.325 --> 00:25:33.377]  Today, here in Los Angeles, we are already seeing ominous signs of an impending social explosion that will make the French rebellion by the Muslim immigrant youth seem tame by comparison, said the leader of the Oslo on November 8th.
[00:25:34.873 --> 00:25:39.716]  All the ingredients are present, including a hostile and racist police as in France.
[00:25:40.097 --> 00:25:44.620]  In fact, we came close to having major riots on three separate occasions just this year alone.
[00:25:46.481 --> 00:25:56.728]  As the mainstream controlled media reports, the immigration protest is peaceful and afford them a wealth of credence and credibility, ignoring the plethora of foreign flags compared to U.S.
[00:25:56.788 --> 00:25:57.168]  flags.
[00:25:57.948 --> 00:26:01.691]  Turn to Mexican TV news stations and you will encounter radical...
[00:26:02.492 --> 00:26:08.637]  Proselytizing about enacting the brutal plan of the invasion and takeover of the southern states of America.
[00:26:09.378 --> 00:26:10.979]  Well, southern and southwest.
[00:26:10.999 --> 00:26:12.060]  I mean, more than just that.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:24.510]  Now, Aslan's goal, known as La Reconquista, is to cede and to take over the entirety of the southern states by any means necessary and impose a communist militant dictatorship.
[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:26.161]  You can tell Paul's from England.
[00:26:26.201 --> 00:26:28.302]  He does a great job, but those are not the southern states.
[00:26:29.944 --> 00:26:32.265]  You look at it, it's the southwestern states, Paul.
[00:26:32.285 --> 00:26:33.386]  You need to change that.
[00:26:33.767 --> 00:26:39.231]  President Bush's blanket amnesty program goes a long way to helping extremists achieve their plan.
[00:26:39.271 --> 00:26:40.612]  He's got links proving all that.
[00:26:41.312 --> 00:26:43.494]  Bush's plan, total amnesty for six years.
[00:26:43.574 --> 00:26:54.502]  Anyone who's here, anyone who gets here, anyone who even wants to come here, skilled or unskilled, corporations can bring in unlimited
[00:26:54.964 --> 00:26:56.245]  All their families can come.
[00:26:56.745 --> 00:26:58.567]  By the way, it isn't 14 million illegals.
[00:26:58.667 --> 00:26:59.848]  It is 30 million.
[00:26:59.868 --> 00:27:02.790]  The major private research firms have done the studies.
[00:27:03.651 --> 00:27:04.251]  30 million.
[00:27:04.311 --> 00:27:06.613]  I mean, folks, no exaggeration.
[00:27:06.633 --> 00:27:09.275]  There's got to be 8 million illegal aliens in Texas.
[00:27:09.395 --> 00:27:10.736]  I mean, more than that.
[00:27:11.156 --> 00:27:12.978]  They're the majority of every major city here.
[00:27:13.018 --> 00:27:13.618]  They admit that.
[00:27:14.199 --> 00:27:16.180]  And the state's got 22 million people in it.
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:17.881]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:27:18.762 --> 00:27:19.983]  And let me tell you something.
[00:27:20.586 --> 00:27:27.028]  I mean, again, you have Mexican-Americans who are great people, love this country, are freaked out by what's happening.
[00:27:27.788 --> 00:27:33.450]  But, I mean, let me tell you, folks, I mean, we'll even try to go patronize some of these places.
[00:27:34.171 --> 00:27:35.551]  And, I mean, you get dirty looks.
[00:27:36.031 --> 00:27:38.432]  You try to go in and buy some breakfast tacos at places.
[00:27:38.772 --> 00:27:40.693]  There's, like, Mexican revolutionary stuff hanging up.
[00:27:41.213 --> 00:27:42.593]  Where I sit in South Austin...
[00:27:45.434 --> 00:27:52.197]  On the 78704, there are two revolutionary Mexican bookstores within 300 yards of me, or maybe 400 yards.
[00:27:52.517 --> 00:28:02.841]  There is a giant Mexican food restaurant that has pictures of people in black masks hanging up, and the guy that runs it, admittedly, is a Mexican revolutionary and says he's going to take over America.
[00:28:03.541 --> 00:28:06.382]  And now, a lot of people I know, you can't even really go there.
[00:28:06.462 --> 00:28:07.943]  I mean, people basically want you to leave.
[00:28:08.823 --> 00:28:15.766]  And, I mean, it is like brown shirtville here, and it's like I'm Jewish or something and Nazi German.
[00:28:16.667 --> 00:28:22.450]  And then you have the mass of Hispanic Americans who speak English, who aren't even really tuning into the Spanish media.
[00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:26.191]  They're, you know, Americanized, and they're totally freaked out.
[00:28:26.212 --> 00:28:28.212]  They're the ones years ago telling me about this.
[00:28:28.232 --> 00:28:30.073]  They're the ones going, hey, you know what that T-shirt means?
[00:28:30.093 --> 00:28:31.254]  It means they're going to kill you.
[00:28:31.923 --> 00:28:32.504]  Go look it up.
[00:28:32.584 --> 00:28:33.004]  Oh, really?
[00:28:33.104 --> 00:28:34.165]  Yes, that's what it means.
[00:28:35.025 --> 00:28:36.927]  And then you go look it up.
[00:28:37.027 --> 00:28:38.108]  Plan of San Diego.
[00:28:38.528 --> 00:28:42.591]  All men above the age of 16, all white males, must die.
[00:28:43.152 --> 00:28:47.415]  And we're to be rounded up and taken to execution centers, and we're to be executed.
[00:28:47.515 --> 00:28:53.560]  And even the Texas Civil Rights, what is it, publication, attacked me.
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:58.984]  They said, oh, Alex is right that there's a plan to kill all white males, but white males are oppressive.
[00:28:59.901 --> 00:29:03.323]  And this is a downtrodden group, so they're allowed to say they're going to kill you.
[00:29:03.343 --> 00:29:06.426]  And you're going to die, and you need to die.
[00:29:06.446 --> 00:29:08.307]  So just lay down and die.
[00:29:08.347 --> 00:29:09.928]  Well, let me give everybody a newsflash.
[00:29:10.308 --> 00:29:11.469]  I'm not going to lay down and die.
[00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:13.631]  It's not going to happen.
[00:29:14.031 --> 00:29:15.452]  You've got the wrong person.
[00:29:16.213 --> 00:29:21.196]  You're not going to kill my children, and you're not going to kill me without a big fight.
[00:29:22.897 --> 00:29:27.541]  So, look, you've been warned, and I'm on record.
[00:29:28.561 --> 00:29:29.422]  It's not going to work.
[00:29:30.464 --> 00:29:33.186]  And of course, the plan is the globalists are setting these people up.
[00:29:34.387 --> 00:29:39.471]  When they try it, when they make their move, the globalists are going to clamp down on the big police state.
[00:29:39.491 --> 00:29:41.913]  They're going to let you riot, do everything you do.
[00:29:42.794 --> 00:29:46.136]  And then you're all going to be numbered and controlled, and a bunch of you will be put in camps.
[00:29:47.377 --> 00:29:48.218]  Or the media.
[00:29:48.398 --> 00:29:49.039]  It's so sick.
[00:29:49.339 --> 00:29:50.360]  You're walking into a trap.
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.300]  I hope you know who your friends are.
[00:29:51.761 --> 00:29:52.701]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.142 --> 00:29:54.763]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.664 --> 00:29:58.346]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.986 --> 00:30:05.291]  And now a word from Dr. Patricia Margaitis from Stem Enhance.
[00:30:05.752 --> 00:30:09.897]  I want to first thank the wonderful GCN listeners for supporting Stem Enhance.
[00:30:10.438 --> 00:30:17.829]  Now know that your own stem cells are your body's maintenance crew, and Stem Enhance makes sure that more of them show up for work every day.
[00:30:18.229 --> 00:30:22.232]  The truth is, the more stem cells you have in your bloodstream, the greater your health.
[00:30:22.613 --> 00:30:36.063]  If you believe there is something more for you, have a strong work ethic, and wish to participate in the monumental increase in the cause for natural health, while gaining financial independence and monthly cash flow, then you are the right person.
[00:30:36.483 --> 00:30:39.826]  I personally invite you to join me as a distributor of Stem Enhancement.

[00:30:44.851 --> 00:30:47.774]  Remember, the first rule of success, you must show up.
[00:30:47.934 --> 00:30:51.238]  Call me, Dr. Patricia Margitis, at 860-567-7744.
[00:30:51.258 --> 00:30:52.799]  That number again, 860-567-7744.
[00:31:02.192 --> 00:31:05.775]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:31:05.795 --> 00:31:06.316]  are located?
[00:31:06.516 --> 00:31:09.919]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:31:10.139 --> 00:31:14.843]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.

[00:32:02.065 --> 00:32:08.930]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:22.019]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Stobie, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.981]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[00:32:24.121 --> 00:32:24.642]  We're good to go.
[00:32:43.365 --> 00:32:43.845]  We're good to go.
[00:33:25.577 --> 00:33:27.558]  29th day of March, 2006.
[00:33:28.698 --> 00:33:33.459]  And they don't have all the toll-free lines hooked into the boards yet.
[00:33:33.499 --> 00:33:35.999]  That should be done by tomorrow, so we can't take calls today.
[00:33:36.019 --> 00:33:42.901]  And I've got some big guests scheduled for tomorrow that you definitely don't want to miss coming up from 11 to 2 Central Standard Time.
[00:33:42.921 --> 00:33:44.341]  But let me just get back to something.
[00:33:45.081 --> 00:33:46.002]  Let me explain something.
[00:33:46.982 --> 00:33:48.222]  I want to live in peace with people.
[00:33:48.695 --> 00:33:55.681]  I grew up in Dallas, Texas, and I had black friends, Hispanic friends, and every time I say that, the little reconquistas are so racist.
[00:33:55.821 --> 00:33:57.562]  Oh, you have Hispanic friends.
[00:33:57.762 --> 00:33:59.904]  Well, we don't want to be your friend, gringo.
[00:34:00.144 --> 00:34:04.547]  You need to go back to Europe, punk, and then add a few choice cuss words.
[00:34:05.248 --> 00:34:07.910]  And that's why, you know, I've gone out and protested the Ku Klux Klan.
[00:34:08.490 --> 00:34:13.054]  I've had them death threat me publicly, right in front of the police and say, I'm going to blow that man's head off.
[00:34:13.761 --> 00:34:19.923]  Up in Waco, and I protested him one time, I guess back in 1999, and I walked over to the police, and I said, you're not going to do anything about that?
[00:34:20.203 --> 00:34:26.265]  And the cop basically said, back off, buddy, and basically let me know that he was with them.
[00:34:26.405 --> 00:34:41.469]  So what happens is, you've got all that going on, and then this other group gets together, and big money, Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, and others, fund this La Rica and Houston, fund the Mexican government that our government's controlled for at least 50 years,
[00:34:42.415 --> 00:34:44.015]  A very corrupt government down there.
[00:34:44.395 --> 00:34:45.916]  Their people don't have any freedom.
[00:34:46.276 --> 00:34:48.236]  Their people aren't allowed to protest down there.
[00:34:49.036 --> 00:34:50.576]  The people are absolute slaves.
[00:34:50.596 --> 00:34:52.937]  There's no middle class in Mexico.
[00:34:52.977 --> 00:34:53.977]  The globalists love that.
[00:34:53.997 --> 00:34:56.017]  They love China, because it's the same way.
[00:34:56.037 --> 00:34:56.778]  They love Russia.
[00:34:56.798 --> 00:34:57.798]  They love enslaving.
[00:34:57.818 --> 00:34:58.478]  They love India.
[00:34:59.058 --> 00:35:03.439]  They love a mass of slaves with a tiny, tiny elite, one-tenth of one percent.
[00:35:04.819 --> 00:35:09.780]  And so now, this crowd of people is up here,
[00:35:11.153 --> 00:35:15.955]  And they're being told that whites are evil, all whites hate them, all whites are out to get them.
[00:35:17.155 --> 00:35:18.155]  And I'm sorry, folks.
[00:35:18.275 --> 00:35:25.077]  I mean, I will protest the Klan, I will protest Mecha and La Raza, and La Raza means, of course, the race.
[00:35:27.278 --> 00:35:32.540]  I will stand up against this, and I will not back off, and I will not go quietly into the night.
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:33.600]  I'm not going to put up with it.
[00:35:35.151 --> 00:35:37.052]  And Americans need to resist this.
[00:35:37.132 --> 00:35:52.221]  I don't care what color you are, and we need to get the press reporting, and we need to get people who speak Spanish to start reporting every night on what's on Spanish TV, what's on Mexican TV channels, what is on right here in California and Texas and Nevada and Arizona.
[00:35:52.841 --> 00:35:55.963]  And by the way, the Oslo crowd is now claiming they want even more states.
[00:35:56.744 --> 00:35:58.244]  I mean, nothing is enough.
[00:36:01.386 --> 00:36:04.528]  So let me continue reading Paul Watson's articles.
[00:36:07.603 --> 00:36:12.065]  All of the ingredients are present, including a hostile and racist police as in France.
[00:36:12.125 --> 00:36:18.468]  In fact, we came close to having major riots on three separate occasions just this year alone to the leader of Aslan.
[00:36:19.229 --> 00:36:28.253]  Aslan's goal, known as La Reconquista, is to cede and take over the entirety of the southwestern states by any means necessary and impose a communist militant dictatorship.
[00:36:28.733 --> 00:36:33.936]  President Bush's blanket amnesty program goes a long way to helping the extremists achieve their goals.
[00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:38.588]  Despite the fact that the majority of documented Hispanics oppose illegal immigration...
[00:36:39.076 --> 00:36:41.758]  As well as American citizens who happen to be Hispanic.
[00:36:42.198 --> 00:36:43.479]  As do the majority of Americans.
[00:36:43.659 --> 00:36:57.208]  Aslan and La Raza race hate groups have become the self-appointed voice of a separatist movement that threatens a violent overthrow of the constitutional system and a barbaric program of ethnic cleansing.
[00:36:57.588 --> 00:37:05.073]  This is held up in the media as diversity, and to vociferously oppose it is scorned as racism.
[00:37:06.072 --> 00:37:08.414]  By the way, blacks and Hispanics were fighting in LA.
[00:37:08.454 --> 00:37:09.755]  That's been documented.
[00:37:09.775 --> 00:37:10.396]  We have a document.
[00:37:33.934 --> 00:37:41.797]  A rallying cry for Hispanic clan groups advocates total eradication of any race but Hispanics, which they call the supreme god race, of the master race.
[00:37:42.257 --> 00:37:45.598]  Metra's own slogan reads, for the race everything, for those outside the race nothing.
[00:37:46.118 --> 00:37:55.181]  TV stations owned by rich white industrialists erect giant billboards in Los Angeles, over 600, claiming that the city belongs to Mexico, as seen below.
[00:37:55.201 --> 00:37:55.921]  We have a photo of it.
[00:37:56.942 --> 00:38:01.963]  Mainstream Hispanics who love America abhor the virulent racism that the Mexican clan groups embrace.
[00:38:01.983 --> 00:38:03.364]  I have a lot of Hispanic friends.
[00:38:04.208 --> 00:38:12.093]  And they tell me that Mexicans will see them, say, in a circuit city, was one story, speaking in English.
[00:38:12.654 --> 00:38:14.695]  And they will march over and say, you're a Mexican!
[00:38:15.055 --> 00:38:16.576]  What are you doing speaking English?
[00:38:16.996 --> 00:38:17.757]  You don't speak that.
[00:38:18.777 --> 00:38:26.222]  And the majority language, English is a second language in L.A., in areas also of Arizona, like Phoenix.
[00:38:26.242 --> 00:38:27.063]  That's mainstream news.
[00:38:27.483 --> 00:38:28.343]  English is second.
[00:38:28.363 --> 00:38:28.984]  Do you understand?
[00:38:30.023 --> 00:38:42.298]  And if you happen to be black or white or Asian, you're not going to get to learn your studies because it's... I mean, you understand already in the southwestern states, these illegal aliens are the majority?
[00:38:42.318 --> 00:38:44.801]  Oh my goodness.
[00:38:46.684 --> 00:38:47.525]  And it goes on and on.
[00:38:49.068 --> 00:38:51.309]  And who bankrolls these pocket radicals?
[00:38:51.429 --> 00:38:56.130]  Billionaire tax-exempt foundations and NGOs, non-governmental organizations, owned by white men.
[00:38:56.211 --> 00:38:57.831]  Organizations like the Ford Foundation.
[00:38:58.151 --> 00:39:01.892]  Groups who are zealous in their quest to eliminate the middle class and destroy America.
[00:39:02.413 --> 00:39:03.593]  They openly say that, by the way.
[00:39:03.813 --> 00:39:10.355]  Turning it into a cashless society, compact city surveillance control grid, where only two tiers of society exist, the elite and the poor slaves.
[00:39:10.836 --> 00:39:13.356]  The Aslan website today carries the following statements.
[00:39:16.157 --> 00:39:17.718]  If the racist Shinson Brenner...
[00:39:19.793 --> 00:39:23.196]  If the racist Simpson-Brenner legislation passes the U.S.
[00:39:23.236 --> 00:39:28.119]  Senate, there is no doubt that a massive civil disobedience movement will emerge.
[00:39:28.219 --> 00:39:41.189]  Eventually, labor union power can merge with the immigrant civil rights and immigrant sanctuary movements to enable us to enter from a new political party or form it and to do heavy-duty reforming of the existing Democratic Party.
[00:39:41.849 --> 00:39:42.690]  That means take it over.
[00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:49.095]  The next and final steps would allow, and that is to elect, our own governors of all the states within Osloin.
[00:39:49.614 --> 00:39:54.215]  Here is the open call for violent separatism and the overthrow of the existing state government structures.
[00:39:54.775 --> 00:40:18.060]  A sizable proportion of the secular humanist westerners who like to think of themselves as part of the establishment when in reality they are unwitting tools of the true elite who have brought into the cuddly utopian philosophy that the West is a global village which welcomes all comers and has the enlightened innate ability to homogenize millions of different people of all different colors and creeds into one giant melting pot.
[00:40:19.304 --> 00:40:29.188]  The reality couldn't be further from the truth, and last year's images of flaming buses, schools, nurseries, and now we have photos of them attacking whites and viciously killing some.
[00:40:29.729 --> 00:40:37.152]  The reality couldn't be further from the truth of last year's images of flaming buses, schools, nurseries, terror and panic in France betray that fact.
[00:40:37.752 --> 00:40:44.735]  Protesters protest over changes in its employment laws that flirted into ongoing riots,
[00:40:45.257 --> 00:40:50.179]  And we have now witnessed similar scenes on the streets of Paris as we saw last November.
[00:40:50.599 --> 00:40:58.082]  The real power behind the clash of civilizations lies with the globalists, in whose interest it is to foment race wars.
[00:40:58.403 --> 00:41:11.248]  Their vision of Western world can best be described as a corporate fascist high-tech slave plantation with all the proles packed into high-rise compact cities that the middle class simply won't exist.
[00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:19.900]  And in closing, every major minority movement throughout history has been infiltrated and steered by the elite in an attempt to obtain these objectives.
[00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:20.961]  Divide and conquer.
[00:41:21.342 --> 00:41:27.490]  The elite want us at each other's throats while they dominate over the downtrodden and befuddled warring tribes.
[00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:36.317]  Race is the ultimate touchstone, hot-button issue, and the globalists have enacted policies of rampant, uncontrolled immigration in order to force hostile cultures to intermingle.
[00:41:36.718 --> 00:41:41.041]  The outcome is always tribal warfare, as we saw in Bosnia and Kosovo and now in Iraq.
[00:41:41.262 --> 00:41:44.905]  Official Pentagon plan, get the three warring factions fighting, break it up in three parts.
[00:41:45.470 --> 00:42:01.138]  The Mexican Klan must be opposed at every turn if we are to prevent America being fed to the dogs of racial purity and ethnic cleansing, an ideology that was supposedly defeated in 1940s Germany, but is openly called for today while the groups carrying it out are protected and funded by the establishment.
[00:42:02.598 --> 00:42:11.463]  And let me tell you, bottom line, and I know we have listeners of every race, color, and creed listening, and many of you have been listening for over a decade here in Central Texas for 12 years actually, nationally for 8.
[00:42:13.344 --> 00:42:14.164]  Let me tell you something.
[00:42:15.029 --> 00:42:16.851]  If you love your children, you listen to me.
[00:42:17.731 --> 00:42:20.734]  If you love your children and you know in your gut right now, I'm your friend.
[00:42:21.274 --> 00:42:23.155]  You know in your gut, I care about you.
[00:42:23.195 --> 00:42:25.717]  You know in your gut, I want you to have a good standard of living.
[00:42:26.038 --> 00:42:27.038]  I want you to be free.
[00:42:27.118 --> 00:42:29.841]  I want a middle class because a middle class protects my family.
[00:42:30.341 --> 00:42:32.122]  If we don't have a middle class, we don't have anything.
[00:42:32.142 --> 00:42:33.944]  We have elite ruling over us.
[00:42:35.023 --> 00:42:37.906]  And I want to tell the Mexican Klan group something right now.
[00:42:38.146 --> 00:42:43.931]  The racist, hate-filled control freaks right here in Austin, just a few hundred yards from where I sit.
[00:42:44.171 --> 00:42:49.275]  They're hate-filled, the equivalent of Ku Klux Klan bookstores, the equivalent of Ku Klux Klan restaurants.
[00:42:50.176 --> 00:42:51.357]  I want you to know something.
[00:42:51.857 --> 00:42:53.719]  We know you're funded by Whitey.
[00:42:54.199 --> 00:42:55.961]  We know you're funded by the big banker money.
[00:42:56.698 --> 00:43:00.919]  We know you're funded by the elite, and we know you're leading your poor people around by the nose.
[00:43:01.279 --> 00:43:17.723]  Poor, hard-working, peasant people who've been slaves for thousands of years to the Aztecs and the Toltecs and the Mayans before the Spanish came, and slaves to the Mayans, and then slaves to Maximilian, and, of course, slaves to Santa Ana, and slaves to all these people.
[00:43:18.163 --> 00:43:25.525]  And you want to use your slave population, who has a hunger for freedom, you want to misdirect them and tell them freedom is some type of race war.
[00:43:27.219 --> 00:43:29.760]  What did the Houston Chronicle report?
[00:43:31.081 --> 00:43:39.986]  They reported that when the immigrant population riots, they're going to lock you up in giant, sprawling concentration camps.
[00:43:41.126 --> 00:43:42.787]  I'm trying to keep you out of camps.
[00:43:43.388 --> 00:43:45.429]  They're going to kick a couple million of you out.
[00:43:46.089 --> 00:43:55.594]  And the white population who's scared, the bleeding hearts that loved you, and then you've been set up to turn them against you with all their money and all their power.
[00:43:56.112 --> 00:43:56.873]  The middle class.
[00:43:57.393 --> 00:43:59.315]  Don't think whites are all a bunch of little wimps.
[00:44:00.076 --> 00:44:02.518]  The veneer of civilization is very, very thin.
[00:44:03.038 --> 00:44:10.705]  Frankly, Anglo-Saxons and Visigoths and Austriagoths and the Franks are the most vicious people the planet has ever seen.
[00:44:10.725 --> 00:44:12.227]  And they're going to be turned loose on you.
[00:44:12.487 --> 00:44:14.369]  And I really feel sorry for you.
[00:44:14.829 --> 00:44:15.430]  And you know what?
[00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:17.752]  They're going to bring in a reign of terror.
[00:44:18.658 --> 00:44:19.859]  And you're being set up.
[00:44:19.919 --> 00:44:20.760]  You're being set up.
[00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:23.102]  Why do you think the Ford Foundation funds you?
[00:44:23.523 --> 00:44:26.966]  Set up by Henry Ford, the worshiper of Adolf Hitler.
[00:44:27.526 --> 00:44:30.269]  You have no idea what you've walked into.
[00:44:30.629 --> 00:44:33.472]  You have no idea the trap that's been set for you.
[00:44:33.752 --> 00:44:37.235]  You have no idea how you're going to be mowed down in the streets by the government.
[00:44:39.045 --> 00:44:46.787]  And meanwhile, after they put a bunch of you in the camps, they're going to put people like me in the camps, and it's going to be supported because you are the next 9-11.
[00:44:46.887 --> 00:44:48.687]  Let me tell you something, oldie conquistas.
[00:44:50.368 --> 00:44:52.068]  You are the next 9-11.
[00:44:52.148 --> 00:44:53.168]  You are the next.
[00:44:53.268 --> 00:44:54.669]  You are their ace in the hole.
[00:44:54.709 --> 00:44:56.269]  A little secret that nobody knows.
[00:44:57.109 --> 00:45:05.651]  Why do big bankers, big white bankers, Anglo-Saxons, Jewish bankers, others, why do they own these big media monopolies?
[00:45:05.671 --> 00:45:07.432]  Because the Spanish media really is an oligopoly.
[00:45:07.452 --> 00:45:08.552]  There's just three big companies.
[00:45:09.557 --> 00:45:14.483]  Why are they here telling you to take over, telling you to riot, telling you to do this?
[00:45:14.603 --> 00:45:16.826]  In 1986, Oliver North testified.
[00:45:17.567 --> 00:45:19.309]  And what did Oliver North testify to?
[00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:26.678]  That there would be race riots by Latin Americans, by Mexicans, who were North Americans, Southern North Americans.
[00:45:27.415 --> 00:45:33.517]  And that they were going to put you in camps, and that they would use that as a smokescreen for martial law to take over America.
[00:45:33.797 --> 00:45:38.919]  Henry B. Gonzalez, a great American congressman, testified to that.
[00:45:38.979 --> 00:45:40.299]  He is in my film.
[00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:46.502]  He is in my film, America Destroyed by Design.
[00:45:47.702 --> 00:45:50.363]  Jack Brooks testified to that, another great Texan.
[00:45:51.397 --> 00:45:59.141]  You're being set up, and your Spanish media isn't going to tell you, Willie, you speak Spanish, you better tell your friends now.
[00:45:59.201 --> 00:46:00.661]  You better defend America.
[00:46:01.202 --> 00:46:03.343]  You better have it on record you're with America.
[00:46:03.823 --> 00:46:08.245]  You better wake up, because now the Houston Chronicle has reported that Rex 84 is in play.
[00:46:09.005 --> 00:46:11.787]  Three one-million-man camps have been built in the Southwest.
[00:46:11.847 --> 00:46:14.228]  Even Newsmax reported on that four years ago.
[00:46:15.288 --> 00:46:16.789]  Three one-million-man camps.
[00:46:17.329 --> 00:46:18.810]  They are now building more camps.
[00:46:19.918 --> 00:46:29.846]  They have now told local police departments nationwide, because I've got family that's in them, that they are going to be taking over and that they're going to start arresting all undocumented illegals.
[00:46:29.926 --> 00:46:30.707]  You fools.
[00:46:31.528 --> 00:46:32.288]  You fools.
[00:46:33.009 --> 00:46:35.211]  And it's only going to be on the surface.
[00:46:35.231 --> 00:46:48.742]  They're going to grab a few million, which is going to look big compared to the 30 million that's here, and then that's going to convince Americans that a police state will deliver us from the invasion, and the media is suddenly going to expose all your racism and all your talk about taking over.
[00:46:49.449 --> 00:46:58.756]  And suddenly the media is going to turn on you on a dime, and then they're going to use this race war that you're going to start as the pretext to bring in the police state.
[00:46:59.317 --> 00:47:03.500]  It may be accompanied with an A-bomb, claiming that the illegal aliens brought it in.
[00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:07.343]  It may be accompanied with a bio-attack, and then we're going to have a national draft.
[00:47:08.064 --> 00:47:10.807]  And we're going to be totally nationalistic, but in a false way.
[00:47:11.187 --> 00:47:16.512]  And Americans will deliver their kids into a giant multi-million man army.
[00:47:17.112 --> 00:47:19.534]  Our military will be fucked in a matter of months.
[00:47:19.895 --> 00:47:23.418]  They will invade the entire planet and take over 60 plus nations.
[00:47:23.838 --> 00:47:24.819]  This is the plan.
[00:47:25.079 --> 00:47:33.967]  This is the Nazi type plan to bring America to its knees as Germany was brought to its knees and rebuild it as the ultimate war mock.
[00:47:34.227 --> 00:47:34.988]  The ultimate...
[00:47:35.822 --> 00:47:37.422]  The ultimate war machine.
[00:47:37.582 --> 00:47:39.103]  The ultimate juggernaut.
[00:47:39.203 --> 00:47:41.383]  It will make Germany look like a joke.
[00:47:41.864 --> 00:47:45.625]  You people have no understanding what has happened.
[00:47:45.885 --> 00:47:49.345]  You have no understanding of what you have been involved in.
[00:47:49.586 --> 00:47:55.247]  You have no understanding of the power you are about to unleash upon yourselves, you fools!
[00:47:55.647 --> 00:48:02.332]  You're out there dancing and giggling and smirking while the evil media and the evil establishment pat you on the head.
[00:48:02.572 --> 00:48:04.274]  You're like lambs to the slaughter.
[00:48:04.534 --> 00:48:07.716]  You're like a hog that's going to be slaughtered for Christmas dinner.
[00:48:08.957 --> 00:48:10.599]  Everything I've told you has come true.
[00:48:10.659 --> 00:48:12.240]  My analysis is on target.
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:14.261]  I understand the mind of the New World Order.
[00:48:14.662 --> 00:48:20.386]  I am blessed with an understanding of their programs, their devices, what they do, how they operate.
[00:48:20.686 --> 00:48:23.028]  And you know in your guts I'm telling you the truth.
[00:48:24.289 --> 00:48:28.910]  Look at Iraq, how they used racial warfare, not even racial, tribal sectarian warfare.
[00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:30.311]  Those people are all the same bloodlines.
[00:48:31.011 --> 00:48:34.732]  The Shiites, the Sunnis, all of them.
[00:48:36.672 --> 00:48:37.613]  Look at what they do in Africa.
[00:48:37.633 --> 00:48:41.053]  They'll play one black tribe off against another, one that's Christian, one that's animist.
[00:48:41.093 --> 00:48:47.755]  The UN will come in and fund the Hutus to kill all the Tutsis, then take their property and give it to Dutch Rochelle and others.
[00:48:48.095 --> 00:48:50.776]  Look how they play Catholic off against Protestant in Northern Ireland.
[00:48:51.474 --> 00:49:00.837]  Their handbook, Brzezinski's own handbook for empire, one of the top globalist strategists, Brzezinski, in a published book, says we are slaves.
[00:49:01.697 --> 00:49:09.859]  He says they are going to use sectarian and racial warfare to balkanize every country they invade and take down.
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:15.201]  While we're busy fighting with each other, the New World Order will keep putting cancer viruses in your vaccines.
[00:49:15.621 --> 00:49:18.082]  They'll keep putting sodium and stannous fluoride in your water.
[00:49:18.462 --> 00:49:20.943]  They'll continue to use depleted uranium worldwide.
[00:49:20.963 --> 00:49:24.344]  They'll continue to send our sons and daughters off to die in foreign wars.
[00:49:24.644 --> 00:49:26.545]  They'll continue to loot the pension funds.
[00:49:26.765 --> 00:49:34.568]  They'll continue to war profiteer while you run around smirking, waving Mexican flags, chanting down with America.
[00:49:34.608 --> 00:49:35.649]  And I got your signs.
[00:49:35.689 --> 00:49:36.549]  I got video of it.
[00:49:36.849 --> 00:49:37.830]  I got photos of it.
[00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:38.630]  It's on the site.
[00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:40.911]  Pictures of white people cut up, dead.
[00:49:42.091 --> 00:49:46.273]  Pictures of you stomping on people in the streets, attacking blacks, attacking whites.
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:48.100]  And you know what?
[00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:49.321]  Tribalism feels good.
[00:49:49.341 --> 00:50:03.612]  It feels good to storm around with your tribe and beat up the other tribe, but at the end of the day, you're going to go back to your ten people to a room, and you're destroying any future you have, any future you'd ever have.
[00:50:03.773 --> 00:50:07.175]  The globalists are manipulating you and playing you like a fiddle.
[00:50:08.276 --> 00:50:09.377]  Playing you like a harp.
[00:50:10.331 --> 00:50:11.932]  And you better listen to me.
[00:50:11.952 --> 00:50:14.412]  What reconquists it is death of America.
[00:50:14.692 --> 00:50:16.953]  Bush is already trying to get the Pan-American Union.
[00:50:17.173 --> 00:50:18.714]  Bush is already trying to get rid of our borders.
[00:50:18.774 --> 00:50:20.134]  Bush wants total amnesty.
[00:50:20.634 --> 00:50:25.916]  You hate Bush, and you know he's corrupt and evil, but you love his idea of getting rid of our borders.
[00:50:30.677 --> 00:50:39.240]  80 plus percent of Americans, including Hispanics and major Poles, who are Americans, are against the borders being wide open, are against all this happening.
[00:50:40.106 --> 00:50:40.566]  We're good to go.
[00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:03.462]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.642 --> 00:51:06.725]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.865 --> 00:51:10.768]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.808 --> 00:51:15.032]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:51:15.393 --> 00:51:19.156]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:19.316 --> 00:51:21.098]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:24.559 --> 00:51:29.360]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:32.561]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.741 --> 00:51:35.621]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:36.082 --> 00:51:42.203]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.743 --> 00:51:43.144]  We're good to go.
[00:52:01.556 --> 00:52:06.160]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:10.824]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[00:52:11.004 --> 00:52:25.017]  The Security Pack includes a Berkey light water purifier, an LED base, two Berkey sport filtration bottles, the Berkey battery adapter, the Berkey MP solar charger, as well as a backup set of two Black Berkey purification elements.
[00:52:25.237 --> 00:52:27.838]  Get the one-stop solution for your emergency and everyday needs.
[00:52:27.858 --> 00:52:28.938]  The Berkey Security Pack.
[00:52:28.978 --> 00:52:30.339]  A retail value of $518 for only $399.
[00:52:53.928 --> 00:52:56.989]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:57.009 --> 00:52:59.730]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:02.731 --> 00:53:08.672]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:08.892 --> 00:53:11.153]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:53:11.353 --> 00:53:17.695]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:53:17.975 --> 00:53:18.476]  Thanks for having me.
[00:53:38.319 --> 00:53:38.900]  We're good to go.
[00:54:08.317 --> 00:54:15.720]  All right, we're back live.
[00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:16.620]  All right, my friends.
[00:54:19.061 --> 00:54:32.547]  Again, the network moved this weekend, and we have four satellites and do three shows at once sometimes, and they're in Minnesota, we're down here in Texas, and so can you imagine all of the connections in between?
[00:54:32.567 --> 00:54:35.088]  They've had four people working on it, literally...
[00:54:36.514 --> 00:54:40.615]  Sometimes people are working 36 hours without sleep, and it's still not all hooked up.
[00:54:41.095 --> 00:54:42.556]  I mean, we've never gone down.
[00:54:42.576 --> 00:54:43.596]  The broadcasts have never gone down.
[00:54:43.636 --> 00:54:44.556]  It's been refeeds.
[00:54:44.616 --> 00:54:47.577]  We're live today on this Wednesday edition, the 29th day of March.
[00:54:48.957 --> 00:54:51.318]  But by tomorrow, I'm told, we'll have the 1-800 lines.
[00:54:51.338 --> 00:54:52.398]  The 1-800 lines are in.
[00:54:52.418 --> 00:54:55.599]  They're just not wired into the board correctly, or not wired in yet.
[00:54:56.739 --> 00:55:01.960]  And we've got a big guest scheduled for tomorrow to come on, another Hollywood person to talk about 9-11.
[00:55:02.881 --> 00:55:04.121]  So a lot coming up tomorrow.
[00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:06.440]  And I'm not even on ISV Inline.
[00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:10.642]  Of course, the phone company first tried to hook the lines up last week at the wrong office.
[00:55:11.582 --> 00:55:15.043]  And we use ISV Inlines and old technology because it's dedicated and works very well.
[00:55:15.623 --> 00:55:18.664]  And so they have them in, but they're not working, connecting to us.
[00:55:18.684 --> 00:55:22.926]  So we're using Skype, which is a digital internet type connection.
[00:55:23.786 --> 00:55:28.528]  And I was up here until 1 last night, and then we were here this morning hooking up with Skype.
[00:55:28.608 --> 00:55:29.888]  And it's working okay.
[00:55:29.908 --> 00:55:32.729]  We had to wire it into the board here on my end, and then
[00:55:33.547 --> 00:55:34.248]  America's going down.
[00:55:56.025 --> 00:56:08.050]  And you've got a bunch of poor, ignorant people who have no understanding of the first level of political subterfuge or Machiavellian politics who have been financed by the big banker boys publicly.
[00:56:08.070 --> 00:56:15.013]  I mean, that's how old white men finance billboards saying America is dead, Mexico.
[00:56:17.374 --> 00:56:17.914]  Oh, man.
[00:56:17.995 --> 00:56:19.995]  I mean, you think you're going to get something out of this?
[00:56:20.596 --> 00:56:22.236]  You think you're going to take over this country?
[00:56:22.256 --> 00:56:23.697]  It is such a sick joke.
[00:56:24.975 --> 00:56:26.397]  So get ready in the next year or so.
[00:56:26.417 --> 00:56:27.297]  It could even be sooner.
[00:56:27.358 --> 00:56:34.565]  As soon as those FEMA camps are finished, and a bunch of them are, they're going to round a bunch of you up and put you in and have lots of video of these foreigners.
[00:56:34.585 --> 00:56:35.406]  Well, they're foreigners.
[00:56:35.426 --> 00:56:36.287]  Well, they were rioting.
[00:56:36.327 --> 00:56:38.349]  Well, they were burning things.
[00:56:39.071 --> 00:56:57.058]  And so we've got to put them in these camps, and then the camps will be set up in front of us, and oh, there are other political dissidents that were destabilizing things, and there were other people that were fighting against and antagonizing the Mexicans and the Latin Americans, so there'll be areas for whites in the camps, and the government will be the arbitrator of the Civil War in America.
[00:56:57.798 --> 00:57:01.219]  How many years did we tell you you'd see Civil War with the Mexicans?
[00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:03.820]  How many years did Glenn Spencer tell you?
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:05.881]  Because he lived in Southern California.
[00:57:05.901 --> 00:57:07.182]  He wasn't racist.
[00:57:07.222 --> 00:57:08.102]  What did Glenn Spencer do?
[00:57:09.184 --> 00:57:12.749]  Glenn Spencer worked with Native American tribes trying to get them their rights.
[00:57:13.149 --> 00:57:14.051]  He was a liberal.
[00:57:14.952 --> 00:57:23.363]  And then, another thing, as I watch Mexican TV, did you know it is allowed on Mexican TV to call Indians names?
[00:57:24.385 --> 00:57:26.587]  Did you know that they call black people names?
[00:57:27.413 --> 00:57:30.755]  This same crowd that says they're the God race, I have them on video at countless events.
[00:57:30.795 --> 00:57:36.098]  That's why blacks will get in fights with them, because you call a black person a, excuse me, using the term, I find it very offensive.
[00:57:36.118 --> 00:57:42.342]  You start calling black people niggers, and that's what they call them, mayatas, black bird and other things.
[00:57:42.522 --> 00:57:45.204]  And, you know, these black guys haul off and start pounding them.
[00:57:46.164 --> 00:57:48.326]  But it'll be five black guys against 50 Mexicans.
[00:57:48.486 --> 00:57:50.527]  And, of course, most Mexicans aren't like that.
[00:57:50.567 --> 00:57:54.349]  It's these racist Mexicans up here.
[00:57:54.369 --> 00:57:55.790]  And, I mean, what have blacks done to you?
[00:57:56.815 --> 00:57:58.935]  I mean, seriously, folks, I've been to these demonstrations.
[00:57:59.596 --> 00:58:02.296]  I have seen Mexicans call black people mayatas.
[00:58:02.836 --> 00:58:05.016]  And you see, they haven't been politically corrected.
[00:58:05.417 --> 00:58:06.477]  They haven't been conditioned.
[00:58:06.497 --> 00:58:07.717]  They haven't been told they're bad.
[00:58:07.757 --> 00:58:09.017]  They haven't been told to lay down.
[00:58:09.257 --> 00:58:11.058]  They haven't been told to not have pride in themselves.
[00:58:11.318 --> 00:58:12.358]  But it's a false pride.
[00:58:12.398 --> 00:58:18.219]  It's a crazy, we are the supreme race, and you mayatas and you gringos, it's over for you.
[00:58:20.419 --> 00:58:22.400]  Well, listen, don't call me gringo anymore.
[00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:24.900]  And don't call me mayata anymore.
[00:58:25.433 --> 00:58:26.934]  You know, don't call my friends my office.
[00:58:27.975 --> 00:58:28.995]  I'm not going to put up with it.
[00:58:30.516 --> 00:58:31.497]  And you know what?
[00:58:31.517 --> 00:58:35.279]  I'm going to expose the rich old white men that are funding me.
[00:58:35.439 --> 00:58:35.840]  Please!
[00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:38.681]  We all need to come together against the New World Order.
[00:58:42.024 --> 00:58:46.246]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.959 --> 00:58:58.620]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:00.341]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.041 --> 00:59:02.162]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.823 --> 00:59:03.623]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.364 --> 00:59:05.304]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.925 --> 00:59:09.907]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.128 --> 00:59:14.270]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.451 --> 00:59:21.455]  All right.
[00:59:22.876 --> 00:59:25.198]  We're live during major upheavals.
[00:59:26.377 --> 00:59:38.182]  Here in the United States, millions and millions and millions and millions of illegal aliens took to the streets and they said, we're taking America over.
[00:59:38.242 --> 00:59:39.623]  America's going down.
[00:59:40.463 --> 00:59:47.306]  And the controlled English-speaking press that predominantly owns the Spanish press, the Mexican press, the Latin American press,
[00:59:48.832 --> 01:00:03.278]  In this country, for the average Hispanic Americans, white Americans, black Americans that watch English television or read the paper, it was everything's fine, loving good people care about you and just want a quality like Martin Luther King.
[01:00:03.758 --> 01:00:09.460]  They're here to help and friendly folks, and we better legalize all of them and legalize whoever comes after that.
[01:00:09.961 --> 01:00:11.581]  Look, they had American flags.
[01:00:11.621 --> 01:00:13.142]  They love America.
[01:00:14.363 --> 01:00:20.830]  And I knew before I changed the channel, I said, honey, I was sitting in bed with my wife late one night, about midnight, I said, because I had never watched TV, I turned it on to watch.
[01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:26.095]  I said, wife, let's go to the local Mexican's channel, and let's go to the national Spanish channel.
[01:00:27.037 --> 01:00:28.758]  And man, it was weird taking over.
[01:00:28.778 --> 01:00:30.940]  There were people screaming on there, we're going to get you.
[01:00:31.481 --> 01:00:34.063]  You'd have 90 foreign flags, every American flag.
[01:00:34.083 --> 01:00:39.427]  You'd have one or two big American flags up front for a staged event, and then just a sea of flags.
[01:00:39.447 --> 01:00:46.353]  People, wild-eyed, screaming, running around, and then busting cars, busting windows out, assaulting people.
[01:00:47.683 --> 01:00:49.385]  In Dallas and in California.
[01:00:49.425 --> 01:00:51.907]  And then the media would say, oh, a fight broke out.
[01:00:52.989 --> 01:00:55.831]  Some blacks and Hispanics got in a fight in L.A.
[01:00:55.871 --> 01:01:00.516]  And then you'd actually go dig in and then find another local report that didn't get national attention.
[01:01:00.576 --> 01:01:08.104]  It would be a group of 100 immigrant rights protesters attacked a group of black students.
[01:01:09.734 --> 01:01:13.697]  Oh, isn't it fun just to run around racially rampaging?
[01:01:13.757 --> 01:01:19.162]  A race riot is so much fun, especially when the media covers it up for you.
[01:01:20.243 --> 01:01:21.504]  Yes.
[01:01:24.046 --> 01:01:26.267]  And, I mean, we just sit here and we watch this.
[01:01:26.327 --> 01:01:28.449]  And I said this would happen a decade ago.
[01:01:28.489 --> 01:01:31.912]  We read the federal documents, and the government is going to pounce.
[01:01:31.952 --> 01:01:34.074]  They can't wait until the Mexicans start burning.
[01:01:34.094 --> 01:01:36.295]  And I predict it will happen in the next year.
[01:01:36.395 --> 01:01:37.136]  It's going to start happening.
[01:01:37.611 --> 01:01:38.331]  You're going to have burning.
[01:01:38.351 --> 01:01:39.212]  You're going to have killing.
[01:01:39.252 --> 01:01:41.654]  And it will all be, oh, look at the sweetness of it.
[01:01:42.394 --> 01:01:43.074]  Bless them.
[01:01:43.555 --> 01:01:49.378]  And then once the backlash forms, they're going to put a bunch of illegal aliens in camps all over the country.
[01:01:49.398 --> 01:01:51.480]  And then they'll start putting American citizens in them.
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:54.561]  And that's Rex 84, 1986, Senate hearings.
[01:01:54.622 --> 01:01:56.483]  That's the Houston Chronicle.
[01:01:56.563 --> 01:01:57.463]  It's mainstream news.
[01:01:59.204 --> 01:02:01.246]  Mainstream news.
[01:02:02.566 --> 01:02:03.267]  In your face.
[01:02:04.167 --> 01:02:04.908]  Out in the open.
[01:02:05.908 --> 01:02:06.609]  No debating it.
[01:02:07.225 --> 01:02:08.886]  I'm looking at photos of Mexican flags.
[01:02:08.906 --> 01:02:11.287]  I'm looking at photos of this is our continent, not yours.
[01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:13.429]  Photos of whites gutted and murdered.
[01:02:13.449 --> 01:02:15.330]  You know, artist depictions.
[01:02:15.350 --> 01:02:16.570]  What sweet little depictions.
[01:02:17.171 --> 01:02:22.134]  I mean, does the Klan go out as bad as they are and have signs of black people with their heads cut off?
[01:02:22.534 --> 01:02:34.601]  I guess it's a good old boy roundup that the BATF put on in 1992 where they were selling black hunting licenses, inward hunting licenses.
[01:02:35.165 --> 01:02:37.146]  And they have little effigies of hanging blacks.
[01:02:37.766 --> 01:02:40.667]  I guess, I guess they do do that, but they do it in private.
[01:02:41.227 --> 01:02:44.569]  It's private to mock, kill the other race, the other group.
[01:02:45.429 --> 01:02:47.290]  Well, not in America.
[01:02:47.970 --> 01:02:51.571]  It's as American as Mom and La Reconquista.
[01:02:51.631 --> 01:02:53.432]  Mom, Apple Pie, and La Reconquista.
[01:02:55.512 --> 01:02:57.733]  There's nothing like a La Reconquista.
[01:02:57.753 --> 01:02:58.333]  There's nothing.
[01:02:58.353 --> 01:02:59.354]  Let's just say it together.
[01:02:59.454 --> 01:03:01.615]  La Reconquista.
[01:03:01.915 --> 01:03:04.116]  The reconquering of the Southwest.
[01:03:04.456 --> 01:03:05.617]  And now the Southwest isn't enough.
[01:03:05.637 --> 01:03:07.337]  They're claiming Oklahoma, Kansas now.
[01:03:07.878 --> 01:03:09.398]  They're claiming Oregon, Washington.
[01:03:10.239 --> 01:03:12.180]  And then now some Aslan group is saying, no, no, no.
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:14.121]  We're getting you all the way out of the Americas.
[01:03:15.721 --> 01:03:16.502]  And who funds it?
[01:03:16.662 --> 01:03:16.962]  Openly.
[01:03:16.982 --> 01:03:17.642]  You cannot debate it.
[01:03:17.882 --> 01:03:19.183]  The big banks.
[01:03:19.223 --> 01:03:20.603]  The big foreign foundations.
[01:03:20.944 --> 01:03:22.264]  The big money.
[01:03:23.305 --> 01:03:23.745]  Big money.
[01:03:24.617 --> 01:03:25.378]  Articles right here.
[01:03:25.398 --> 01:03:28.480]  600 plus, almost 700 billboards in L.A.
[01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:29.641]  saying this is Mexico.
[01:03:30.002 --> 01:03:30.642]  Paid for.
[01:03:31.923 --> 01:03:33.805]  Paid for by a non-Hispanic.
[01:03:35.266 --> 01:03:35.867]  Paid for!
[01:03:37.948 --> 01:03:41.451]  Why are the rich white people paying the fomentives?
[01:03:41.491 --> 01:03:47.076]  Because while we're all busy at each other's throats, they're going to rape the living daylights out of us.
[01:03:47.096 --> 01:03:48.517]  I've got a bunch of other news coming up.
[01:03:49.638 --> 01:03:51.860]  Oh yeah, there's a new classification of terrorists.
[01:03:54.969 --> 01:03:57.791]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:58.072 --> 01:03:59.653]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:04:00.013 --> 01:04:04.697]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:05.017 --> 01:04:11.763]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:12.083 --> 01:04:14.065]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:14.265 --> 01:04:17.087]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:17.208 --> 01:04:21.872]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:22.072 --> 01:04:26.476]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight, piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.716 --> 01:04:33.962]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:34.202 --> 01:04:36.604]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[01:05:54.318 --> 01:05:59.741]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the US have diabetes.
[01:06:00.061 --> 01:06:07.024]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[01:06:07.164 --> 01:06:11.706]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[01:06:11.886 --> 01:06:14.708]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[01:07:12.189 --> 01:07:30.658]  You know, most talk show hosts, if they can't take calls and they're not going to have guests, and they can't have guests, can't do three hours by themselves.
[01:07:31.059 --> 01:07:33.540]  Because the network just moved this weekend
[01:07:34.164 --> 01:07:40.025]  Four satellites, all these uplinks, can run three shows at once, and they've got the phone lines and all that in, but they're not hooked up yet.
[01:07:40.405 --> 01:07:44.686]  By tomorrow, we should have the phone lines, God willing, so we can take your phone calls.
[01:07:45.326 --> 01:07:47.647]  It is the 29th day of March 2006.
[01:07:48.287 --> 01:07:52.368]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and we've got an hour and 51 minutes left.
[01:07:52.808 --> 01:07:56.689]  Kevin Smith works here at the office, and he really researched the whole of the Reconquista movement.
[01:07:56.729 --> 01:07:58.069]  He's been on demonstrations with us.
[01:07:58.949 --> 01:08:02.830]  Well, one demonstration against the Reconquistas, where they were wearing shirts saying that
[01:08:03.237 --> 01:08:16.281]  They were going to kill all white males about the age of 16, a German plan that was given to the Mexicans, and they actually carried it out and helped the Skelter-type Charles Manson killings where at least 24 people were murdered in South Texas.
[01:08:16.321 --> 01:08:17.661]  That's kept real quiet.
[01:08:18.481 --> 01:08:26.924]  And right now, I predict the next year you're going to see giant riots, and you're going to see lots of Reginald Denny's with their heads beat in,
[01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:30.722]  And the media's going to go, look how sweet, they're loving him.
[01:08:31.102 --> 01:08:32.282]  They're freeing him.
[01:08:32.442 --> 01:08:34.143]  Evil white men must die.
[01:08:34.924 --> 01:08:37.245]  Loving liberalness.
[01:08:38.445 --> 01:08:39.506]  I mean, I'm not kidding.
[01:08:39.546 --> 01:08:51.212]  The Texas Civil Rights Review, whenever I put out my report about the La Reconquista shirts at the Mexican Independence Day thing last year, I put out my report on it, and they chastised me.
[01:08:51.232 --> 01:08:55.034]  They said, of course, the plan of San Diego says kill all white men above the age of 16 or 16 and up.
[01:08:56.204 --> 01:08:58.006]  This, you know, white men are evil.
[01:08:58.626 --> 01:09:00.048]  White men have done bad.
[01:09:00.068 --> 01:09:01.870]  I mean, these are downtrodden people.
[01:09:02.791 --> 01:09:04.292]  Just let them say it.
[01:09:04.332 --> 01:09:05.373]  What's wrong with that?
[01:09:05.833 --> 01:09:08.876]  What's wrong with saying kill certain people?
[01:09:08.957 --> 01:09:10.378]  I mean, they're downtrodden.
[01:09:10.418 --> 01:09:11.499]  Don't you understand it?
[01:09:11.519 --> 01:09:14.302]  I'm supposed to go, oh, yes.
[01:09:15.126 --> 01:09:16.786]  Yes, I understand now.
[01:09:16.886 --> 01:09:17.607]  I understand.
[01:09:17.707 --> 01:09:18.287]  I'm bad.
[01:09:18.627 --> 01:09:20.227]  No, I've done nothing to anyone.
[01:09:20.567 --> 01:09:26.509]  I'm just here living my life, wanting you to live in freedom, whether you're Hispanic, black, white, polka-dotted, purple.
[01:09:26.529 --> 01:09:29.930]  I mean, I don't care if you're lime green.
[01:09:31.050 --> 01:09:32.451]  I don't care if you're an albino.
[01:09:33.411 --> 01:09:34.771]  We all need to live in freedom.
[01:09:34.811 --> 01:09:36.532]  But what do the globalists do in Africa?
[01:09:36.552 --> 01:09:37.572]  What do they do in Ireland?
[01:09:37.592 --> 01:09:38.992]  What do they do with the Arabs?
[01:09:39.032 --> 01:09:39.993]  What do they do in Iraq?
[01:09:40.253 --> 01:09:41.233]  What do they do in Serbia?
[01:09:42.987 --> 01:09:44.488]  They foment race war.
[01:09:44.528 --> 01:09:51.471]  They get a group to attack, and the globalists will then get that minority group to attack the group that they want to be able to attack.
[01:09:51.511 --> 01:09:56.233]  When that group fights back, they attack that group and the minority group, and then everybody gets enslaved.
[01:09:57.674 --> 01:10:03.297]  And here it is, Spanish media organizations nationwide organized mass protest, AP.
[01:10:03.777 --> 01:10:04.658]  Well, I already knew that.
[01:10:04.698 --> 01:10:05.378]  You could tune in.
[01:10:06.195 --> 01:10:08.497]  And we're taking over.
[01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:09.599]  This is really Mexico.
[01:10:09.999 --> 01:10:11.401]  Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.
[01:10:11.441 --> 01:10:13.222]  Take back our country, Mexico!
[01:10:13.403 --> 01:10:13.963]  Take it back!
[01:10:14.063 --> 01:10:19.809]  Meanwhile, Bush's financing and funding and the big foundations here totally have Fox and others in their hip pocket.
[01:10:19.829 --> 01:10:20.450]  That's admitted.
[01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:22.732]  Chase Manhattan Citibank owns that country.
[01:10:23.253 --> 01:10:27.818]  They have the biggest poor to rich ratio in the world.
[01:10:28.427 --> 01:10:32.972]  They have the biggest peon slave class and they're pointing their entire revolution at the U.S.
[01:10:32.992 --> 01:10:37.418]  to bring down America and big money is financing it.
[01:10:37.458 --> 01:10:39.240]  We documented the big article we put out.
[01:10:40.367 --> 01:10:46.790]  And when we say that the La Reconquista, the group called The Race and others, claim that for their race, everything, for those outside the race, nothing.
[01:10:47.070 --> 01:10:54.294]  When we claim that they say they want to kill us, kill whites and drive blacks out, we have links to their own founding documents.
[01:10:54.314 --> 01:10:56.635]  We have links to the UT History Department.
[01:10:56.855 --> 01:11:01.097]  We have links to the Mexico City History Department of Mexico City University.
[01:11:01.377 --> 01:11:03.318]  University of Mexico at Mexico City.
[01:11:04.478 --> 01:11:05.639]  I mean, this isn't a joke.
[01:11:06.303 --> 01:11:07.224]  This isn't a game.
[01:11:07.304 --> 01:11:08.244]  This isn't a drill.
[01:11:08.685 --> 01:11:10.866]  This is really happening.
[01:11:13.028 --> 01:11:14.429]  And what does the mainstream media do?
[01:11:14.489 --> 01:11:20.073]  They zoom in on the few American flags, and I actually sat there and counted from photographs and on TV.
[01:11:21.314 --> 01:11:28.059]  There are huge, big, 11 megapixel photos online where you can actually, with your computer, zoom into the crowd.
[01:11:28.419 --> 01:11:32.042]  And I counted 90 foreign flags to each American flag.
[01:11:33.021 --> 01:11:34.241]  But the organizers were smart.
[01:11:34.401 --> 01:11:36.462]  They would stick a couple big American flags up front.
[01:11:37.382 --> 01:11:39.663]  The mainstream controlled media here would just show those.
[01:11:40.483 --> 01:11:41.063]  And it was hard.
[01:11:41.083 --> 01:11:42.664]  You could still see Mexicans in the background.
[01:11:42.764 --> 01:11:47.285]  And then in Venezuelan and Guatemalan and Nicaraguan and Argentinian and all of them.
[01:11:48.305 --> 01:11:51.746]  And Chilean, Uruguayan.
[01:11:52.926 --> 01:11:54.107]  You could see it all there.
[01:11:54.227 --> 01:11:54.787]  Belizean.
[01:11:54.807 --> 01:11:56.587]  I mean, it was all in Belize, British speaking.
[01:11:57.308 --> 01:11:58.688]  It was all right there.
[01:11:59.875 --> 01:12:03.977]  And then you could watch Mexican television, and it was, we are taking over, this is our country.
[01:12:04.798 --> 01:12:06.238]  My wife speaks Spanish, folks.
[01:12:06.258 --> 01:12:07.019]  She's sitting there watching.
[01:12:07.719 --> 01:12:08.960]  And just running around wild.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.501]  And you could read the placards in English.
[01:12:11.181 --> 01:12:12.982]  This is our continent, not yours.
[01:12:13.342 --> 01:12:13.862]  Get out.
[01:12:16.484 --> 01:12:20.626]  Now, I'm going to get more into this later, but right now, let me give you the bombshell of bombshells.
[01:12:20.646 --> 01:12:23.167]  There's been big developments with the Charlie Sheen story.
[01:12:23.207 --> 01:12:24.408]  We'll tell you about that a little bit later.
[01:12:24.428 --> 01:12:26.269]  We've still got over an hour and 45 minutes left.
[01:12:29.267 --> 01:12:33.049]  Virginia Training Manual lists property rights activists as terrorists.
[01:12:33.069 --> 01:12:36.951]  It says video cameras, binoculars, sketch pads are terrorist tools.
[01:12:37.091 --> 01:12:44.676]  Remember two years ago when the FBI shot anyone with a travel almanac in their car as a terrorist?
[01:12:44.716 --> 01:12:45.516]  Go ahead and arrest them.
[01:12:45.536 --> 01:12:46.296]  Go ahead and bring them in.
[01:12:46.757 --> 01:12:48.378]  San Francisco Chronicle, Associated Press.
[01:12:49.038 --> 01:12:58.003]  Remember back in 1999, the Phoenix Training Manual, over 20,000 of them handed out to police all over that state.
[01:12:58.968 --> 01:13:04.570]  And we've gotten similar ones nationwide, saying that all gun owners are terrorists.
[01:13:04.650 --> 01:13:06.870]  People who make frequent references to the U.S.
[01:13:06.910 --> 01:13:09.411]  Constitution are terrorists.
[01:13:10.831 --> 01:13:13.292]  Animal rights activists are terrorists.
[01:13:13.432 --> 01:13:14.793]  Environmental activists are terrorists.
[01:13:14.813 --> 01:13:15.573]  Everybody's a terrorist.
[01:13:18.053 --> 01:13:22.455]  Word for word, it says, those that make frequent references to the U.S.
[01:13:22.495 --> 01:13:23.975]  Constitution are terrorists.
[01:13:25.375 --> 01:13:27.056]  Law enforcement magazines
[01:13:28.161 --> 01:13:29.323]  That's out of Dallas.
[01:13:30.344 --> 01:13:30.864]  What was it?
[01:13:30.904 --> 01:13:39.273]  It was in 2002, put out a publication, and said, police officer, if you see someone, would they get us out of the U.N.
[01:13:39.293 --> 01:13:39.653]  sticker?
[01:13:40.154 --> 01:13:42.836]  I've probably seen 200 of those in the last year in Austin, and they're everywhere.
[01:13:43.937 --> 01:13:47.441]  If you see one, go ahead and pull them over, go ahead and take them to jail.
[01:13:47.921 --> 01:13:48.702]  It says it.
[01:13:49.964 --> 01:13:51.105]  Take them to jail.
[01:13:52.083 --> 01:13:58.405]  And police chiefs, don't chastise your officers for arresting them, for taking them to jail, because this is a sign of a terrorist.
[01:14:00.046 --> 01:14:14.332]  Now, do you understand that after we reported all this, we were sent videos by firefighters, videos by police, slack training was sent to us by a federal marshal, who's now retired, but at the time he was in there.
[01:14:15.752 --> 01:14:18.853]  Ladies and gentlemen, it lists all homeschoolers as terrorists.
[01:14:19.634 --> 01:14:20.514]  It says homeschoolers.
[01:14:21.571 --> 01:14:26.593]  It lists gun rights activists as terrorists, period, and says that we need to be arrested.
[01:14:27.273 --> 01:14:29.234]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have the latest one.
[01:14:29.414 --> 01:14:32.315]  And I'm so busy that I never even scan this stuff in and put it on the web.
[01:14:32.555 --> 01:14:33.555]  I have a box of this.
[01:14:33.595 --> 01:14:40.818]  We are bathing in DVDs and tapes and federal training manuals, and we're just literally grounding it.
[01:14:40.838 --> 01:14:43.298]  I mean, it's almost like a vat.
[01:14:43.338 --> 01:14:46.740]  I have a whole storage facility room just full of box.
[01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:48.900]  I could just jump into it and roll around.
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:50.261]  I mean, there's that much.
[01:14:50.281 --> 01:14:50.921]  Do you understand?
[01:14:51.690 --> 01:14:54.371]  There's so much evidence that I can't even cover it all.
[01:14:55.072 --> 01:14:59.814]  Remember a year and a half ago, it made the Associated Press and it made the Lansing Journal.
[01:14:59.834 --> 01:15:04.936]  And it was the equivalent of a re-education camp out of the movie Red Dawn.
[01:15:07.637 --> 01:15:20.963]  The fictitious group known as Homeschoolers Against Public Education, the local SWAT team and the local police dressed up in paramilitary fatigues,
[01:15:22.088 --> 01:15:32.215]  They took the 5th and 6th graders, the entire 5th and 6th grade classes, from the intermediate school and the last grade of elementary, they parked a whole bunch of buses out in the front parking lot.
[01:15:32.676 --> 01:15:37.179]  They had the kids come out, and they poured red syrup on them.
[01:15:37.339 --> 01:15:42.783]  Now, I even have video of this at another training grill in 2000 in Belton, Texas, just south of Temple.
[01:15:43.883 --> 01:15:44.464]  You understand that?
[01:15:45.304 --> 01:15:46.085]  It's in Road to Tyranny.
[01:15:47.106 --> 01:15:51.509]  They put fake intestines on them, plastic intestines, fake severed arms,
[01:15:53.588 --> 01:15:57.314]  They have older kids come in from the drama department to run around and scream and cry.
[01:15:57.334 --> 01:15:59.237]  And we have video of this.
[01:16:00.231 --> 01:16:09.034]  And the small children cry and scream and beg for mommy as men point MP5 submachine guns at them.
[01:16:09.054 --> 01:16:12.134]  Now, this is what the Soviets would do in re-education camps.
[01:16:12.174 --> 01:16:17.056]  Running around, terrorizing, breaking up families, beating people up 24 hours a day, movie screens.
[01:16:17.096 --> 01:16:22.877]  When you see that in Red Dawn, folks, that's what a real Soviet or Chinese education camp or Fidel Castro did.
[01:16:22.917 --> 01:16:24.278]  I mean, this is mainstream.
[01:16:24.598 --> 01:16:25.458]  They admit they do it.
[01:16:26.178 --> 01:16:27.179]  Well, this was even worse.
[01:16:27.219 --> 01:16:28.299]  They take them really small.
[01:16:30.434 --> 01:16:33.636]  I mean, a little kid, if you talk to them and they don't know, you get scared and shy.
[01:16:33.676 --> 01:16:34.237]  Can you imagine?
[01:16:34.257 --> 01:16:36.438]  I have video of them pointing guns at them, screaming.
[01:16:36.959 --> 01:16:40.001]  Oh, but it's a drill because we had a school shooting and we can't have that happen again.
[01:16:42.722 --> 01:16:44.223]  So all of this is going on.
[01:16:45.564 --> 01:16:47.405]  And they're running around terrorizing them.
[01:16:47.425 --> 01:16:49.787]  The parents got mad, started suing over it.
[01:16:50.087 --> 01:16:54.990]  And they said, well, listen, we got a couple hundred thousand dollars in a Homeland Security grant to do this.
[01:16:55.571 --> 01:16:56.792]  They do this nationwide.
[01:16:58.467 --> 01:16:59.748]  That's mind control.
[01:17:00.189 --> 01:17:07.075]  Dumping fake blood on children and having adult men run around screaming and have smoke bombs going off in buses.
[01:17:08.176 --> 01:17:11.039]  He is trauma-based mind control.
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:13.501]  Well, what do I have right here?
[01:17:15.343 --> 01:17:18.225]  What do I have right here on PrisonPlanet.com?
[01:17:18.445 --> 01:17:19.126]  It's huge.
[01:17:20.287 --> 01:17:21.168]  Get it out to everybody.
[01:17:22.003 --> 01:17:25.384]  Virginia Training Manual lists property rights activists as terrorists.
[01:17:25.764 --> 01:17:28.866]  It says video cameras, binoculars, sketchpads are terrorist tools.
[01:17:30.886 --> 01:17:42.250]  And it says the Virginia Training Manual used to help state employees recognize terrorists lists anti-government and property rights activists as terrorists and includes binoculars, video cameras, pads and notebooks, and a compendium of terrorist tools.
[01:17:42.290 --> 01:17:43.151]  So alternative press.
[01:17:43.751 --> 01:17:51.714]  The manual discovered by Virginia News Source, mainstream news, is keen to emphasize that terrorists are not only Middle Eastern in scope,
[01:17:52.723 --> 01:18:00.146]  The main focus is afforded to domestic terrorism, included with Hamas, Al-Qaeda, Islamic Jihad, or the following groups are identified as terrorist organizations.
[01:18:00.967 --> 01:18:12.952]  In any anti-government militia movements, or property rights activists, or in any racist, separatist, or hate groups, or in environmental or animal rights activity, or a religious extremist, or in a street gang.
[01:18:12.972 --> 01:18:17.434]  So they mix in street gang and the Klan with property rights activists.
[01:18:19.955 --> 01:18:21.817]  And this is the 2006 manual.
[01:18:22.257 --> 01:18:24.839]  Right as the Supreme Court rules, you don't own your private property.
[01:18:24.879 --> 01:18:27.101]  Now, we have scans of the document.
[01:18:27.641 --> 01:18:29.122]  And we have links to the entire document.
[01:18:29.142 --> 01:18:32.065]  And it says, clear as day.
[01:18:34.086 --> 01:18:35.027]  Clear as day.
[01:18:35.988 --> 01:18:37.429]  Property rights activists.
[01:18:37.449 --> 01:18:38.369]  That's all it says.
[01:18:40.231 --> 01:18:43.273]  And it says their goal is to influence government and social policy.
[01:18:43.814 --> 01:18:45.155]  Yeah, lobbying, protesting.
[01:18:46.196 --> 01:18:47.657]  And it says, arrest them.
[01:18:48.617 --> 01:18:49.138]  Arrest them.
[01:18:49.944 --> 01:18:50.424]  Arrest them.
[01:18:51.085 --> 01:18:56.247]  Arrest them.
[01:18:56.327 --> 01:18:58.528]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:58.588 --> 01:19:00.329]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:01.522 --> 01:19:09.389]  The best-kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:09.629 --> 01:19:12.271]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed, Inc.'
[01:19:12.251 --> 01:19:13.652]  's patented methodology.
[01:19:13.812 --> 01:19:20.758]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy tumors of any size without adverse side effects.
[01:19:21.018 --> 01:19:24.001]  At a physician's office, Star Wars technology at its best.
[01:19:24.361 --> 01:19:24.841]  We're good to go.
[01:19:59.516 --> 01:20:02.780]  Currency devaluation, inflation, one and the same.
[01:20:03.521 --> 01:20:07.466]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:20:13.755 --> 01:20:14.515]  We're good to go.
[01:20:14.535 --> 01:20:14.715]  I think?
[01:20:37.668 --> 01:20:37.928]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:54.631 --> 01:21:03.693]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:21:03.953 --> 01:21:15.175]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:21:15.515 --> 01:21:21.236]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:21:21.476 --> 01:21:22.176]  Foul tastes like
[01:21:22.276 --> 01:21:24.096]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:21:53.334 --> 01:21:55.416]  Gee, honey, those new sandals look great on you.
[01:21:55.616 --> 01:21:57.857]  And look, they show off my new toenails, too.
[01:21:58.158 --> 01:21:58.838]  New toenails?
[01:21:59.219 --> 01:22:00.199]  What happened to the old ones?
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:03.882]  Well, they're not really new, just clear and healthy looking.
[01:22:04.422 --> 01:22:05.844]  Remember how embarrassed I was?
[01:22:05.864 --> 01:22:08.646]  They were so discolored, really awful looking.
[01:22:08.886 --> 01:22:10.247]  Well, they sure look clear now.
[01:22:10.267 --> 01:22:12.368]  Gosh, I wish I could wear sandals again.
[01:22:12.529 --> 01:22:13.890]  My toenails are a disaster.
[01:22:13.930 --> 01:22:16.752]  Look, this one looks white, and that one's thick and yellow.
[01:22:16.972 --> 01:22:18.173]  Well, here's my secret.
[01:22:18.755 --> 01:22:19.796]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:22:20.276 --> 01:22:24.340]  It clears out yellowing keratin debris, the source of nail discoloration.
[01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:25.961]  Ah, so that's it.
[01:22:26.201 --> 01:22:28.763]  I've got ugly keratin debris built up under my nails.
[01:22:29.024 --> 01:22:30.685]  And Non-X Nail Gel gets rid of it.
[01:22:31.165 --> 01:22:34.208]  Now, you'll need to use it every day, but clear nails are worth it.
[01:22:34.628 --> 01:22:35.168]  You bet.
[01:22:35.408 --> 01:22:39.510]  You know, when we go to the beach this summer, my toenails are going to look just as good as yours do.
[01:22:39.670 --> 01:22:41.191]  Thanks to Nonex Nail Gel.
[01:22:41.571 --> 01:22:42.731]  Nonex Nail Gel.
[01:22:42.891 --> 01:22:44.572]  For clear, healthy-looking nails.
[01:22:44.932 --> 01:22:50.014]  Now at Walgreens, Rite Aid, Eckerd, Brooks, Longs, Duane Reade, and Walmart.
[01:22:50.214 --> 01:22:51.314]  In the foot care section.
[01:22:54.856 --> 01:22:59.998]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:00.658 --> 01:23:02.939]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:05.487 --> 01:23:16.141]  Now, we first saw it in Project Megiddo back in 1998, FBI project, and it lists homeschoolers as terrorists, all homeschoolers.
[01:23:16.821 --> 01:23:24.371]  And again, people didn't believe us on this, and then it was all over the mainstream news in Michigan, and it's happening nationwide, but it made big news there because the parents got really mad.
[01:23:25.109 --> 01:23:30.374]  And they drilled the children that homeschooler parents were going to come and kill them and bomb them.
[01:23:30.434 --> 01:23:33.477]  Now, homeschoolers, the corporations fight over them.
[01:23:34.498 --> 01:23:38.982]  They have the highest test scores, the highest spelling bee scores, the highest geography bee scores.
[01:23:40.824 --> 01:23:44.327]  They have the highest ratio of getting the biggest scholarships.
[01:23:44.668 --> 01:23:46.029]  These are all national numbers.
[01:23:46.488 --> 01:23:47.008]  We're good to go.
[01:24:16.949 --> 01:24:17.789]  There's an exodus.
[01:24:17.910 --> 01:24:19.030]  And so they're panicking.
[01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:21.451]  And so they're teaching everyone that it is criminal.
[01:24:21.491 --> 01:24:24.933]  And California and Illinois are trying to ban it and trying to restrict it.
[01:24:26.594 --> 01:24:28.495]  And so we have it in their own training manuals.
[01:24:28.515 --> 01:24:34.678]  Then I was sent in 2001, right after 9-11, footage from Kansas City.
[01:24:34.698 --> 01:24:37.840]  It's in my film Road to Tyranny.
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:44.183]  Where FEMA was teaching a room full of police, firefighters, and sheriff's deputies that, quote, all Christians are terrorists.
[01:24:44.887 --> 01:24:47.229]  The Founding Fathers were bad and were terrorists.
[01:24:48.029 --> 01:24:51.792]  And that all of this stuff is just wonderful and that we need to go after these people.
[01:24:52.653 --> 01:24:53.473]  Now, I have video.
[01:24:53.954 --> 01:24:54.594]  I have news articles.
[01:24:54.654 --> 01:24:55.195]  I have documents.
[01:24:55.535 --> 01:25:02.420]  The latest one here, and here it is, the cover, Terrorism and Security Awareness Orientation for State Employees.
[01:25:03.881 --> 01:25:05.162]  Do you read me?
[01:25:06.884 --> 01:25:08.645]  And then they have this sick thing under the cover.
[01:25:08.685 --> 01:25:10.805]  It says, The Price of Freedom is Vigilance.
[01:25:10.865 --> 01:25:11.765]  How sick is that?
[01:25:12.125 --> 01:25:13.626]  They have Thomas Jefferson under it.
[01:25:13.666 --> 01:25:15.706]  It says, Governor Mark Warner.
[01:25:17.227 --> 01:25:24.769]  And it says, To a greater extent, perhaps, than any other state in America, Virginia faces unique threats in a war against terrorism.
[01:25:25.689 --> 01:25:35.655]  And he says, I want to assure that all of the numerous state government are brought to bear in safeguarding the people of Virginia.
[01:25:35.915 --> 01:25:37.076]  Governor Mark Warner.
[01:25:37.276 --> 01:25:38.216]  Now, that's the cover.
[01:25:38.636 --> 01:25:40.317]  You can go read the entire thing.
[01:25:40.958 --> 01:25:43.359]  The entire thing on prisonplanet.com.
[01:25:43.379 --> 01:25:48.762]  You can link through to the mainstream news reporting on it, and you can read the entire manual.
[01:25:48.822 --> 01:25:53.905]  In fact, Paul Watson, I know you're listening, just go get the whole manual and post it on our site, because they might take it down.
[01:25:53.925 --> 01:25:55.246]  Okay?
[01:25:55.286 --> 01:25:55.426]  Okay.
[01:25:56.343 --> 01:25:57.343]  And what does it list?
[01:25:58.603 --> 01:26:00.304]  It says report them immediately.
[01:26:00.444 --> 01:26:01.964]  Bring them into custody if need be.
[01:26:05.165 --> 01:26:12.966]  It says anyone with sketch pads or notebooks, maps or charts, still or video equipment, handheld tape recorder, binoculars, scuba equipment, disguises.
[01:26:14.186 --> 01:26:18.187]  Folks, I have little outfits.
[01:26:18.347 --> 01:26:20.827]  Once or twice a year I'll play the part of a SWAT team commander.
[01:26:20.847 --> 01:26:22.267]  I call him Global Love Cop on TV.
[01:26:22.307 --> 01:26:25.628]  I'll dress up like the Emperor when Star Wars came up and do a skit and a joke.
[01:26:27.126 --> 01:26:28.226]  And I can tell you to go to jail.
[01:26:28.286 --> 01:26:29.447]  I've got scuba equipment.
[01:26:29.527 --> 01:26:33.951]  I've got binoculars for looking at birds when I have time and for hunting back when I have time.
[01:26:34.571 --> 01:26:35.432]  Handheld tape recorder.
[01:26:35.452 --> 01:26:36.913]  Got about five or six of those.
[01:26:37.573 --> 01:26:38.794]  Still video camera equipment.
[01:26:38.814 --> 01:26:40.435]  I've probably got ten cameras over the years.
[01:26:40.916 --> 01:26:41.716]  Maps and charts.
[01:26:41.776 --> 01:26:42.457]  Got all those.
[01:26:42.557 --> 01:26:43.678]  Sketch pads and notebooks.
[01:26:43.698 --> 01:26:45.399]  There's three of those on my desk right now.
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:49.482]  And of course we have the article two years ago, year and a half ago.
[01:26:49.502 --> 01:26:50.423]  Almanacs.
[01:26:50.563 --> 01:26:51.484]  Travel almanacs.
[01:26:51.504 --> 01:26:53.085]  Arrest immediately in your car.
[01:26:54.147 --> 01:26:59.331]  And I went out to my car, and there was the Rand McNally Road Almanac in my back seat.
[01:26:59.952 --> 01:27:03.735]  You know, behind the front seat, stuck in the little area there.
[01:27:03.815 --> 01:27:07.257]  You know, there's like that envelope or sleeve where you can stick stuff.
[01:27:08.999 --> 01:27:09.960]  That's what I have in there.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.381]  I mean, I'm just, I'm evil, folks.
[01:27:11.461 --> 01:27:12.461]  I'm just totally evil.
[01:27:13.062 --> 01:27:20.568]  Meanwhile, we have millions of illegal aliens rampaging around saying they're taking America over with Mexican flags, saying it's already concussed, and the media covers it up.
[01:27:22.626 --> 01:27:24.968]  And it says right here, influence government policy.
[01:27:25.008 --> 01:27:27.170]  It says, what are terrorists after now?
[01:27:28.010 --> 01:27:30.552]  The terrorists have the following goals in mind when committing their acts.
[01:27:31.273 --> 01:27:32.934]  Influence government or social policy.
[01:27:33.535 --> 01:27:35.376]  Create an atmosphere of anxiety amongst the public.
[01:27:35.396 --> 01:27:36.117]  What's the media do?
[01:27:36.437 --> 01:27:37.598]  Undermine confidence in the government.
[01:27:37.658 --> 01:27:39.159]  Well, the government's totally criminal.
[01:27:39.179 --> 01:27:40.220]  The Founding Fathers did that.
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:42.402]  No one should have confidence in this corrupt government.
[01:27:42.422 --> 01:27:43.983]  We need to get our original government back.
[01:27:44.123 --> 01:27:48.106]  It says, word for word, listing terrorists.
[01:27:48.547 --> 01:27:50.228]  Property rights activists.
[01:27:51.748 --> 01:27:52.269]  I told you.
[01:27:52.569 --> 01:27:53.349]  What have I said for years?
[01:27:53.469 --> 01:27:54.970]  Property rights activists.
[01:27:55.090 --> 01:27:56.310]  Land rights activists.
[01:27:56.670 --> 01:27:57.391]  Gun owners.
[01:27:59.392 --> 01:28:00.092]  How did we know that?
[01:28:00.152 --> 01:28:01.613]  We have the other manuals.
[01:28:01.653 --> 01:28:02.833]  This is just one more.
[01:28:04.434 --> 01:28:05.514]  One more of these.
[01:28:07.695 --> 01:28:09.796]  Now, property rights activists were actually never listed.
[01:28:09.976 --> 01:28:12.597]  It listed land rights activists and things like that.
[01:28:12.617 --> 01:28:16.819]  But property rights activists I have seen on videotapes of police being given little federal...
[01:28:17.893 --> 01:28:18.533]  We're on the march.
[01:28:18.553 --> 01:28:21.255]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.024 --> 01:28:50.705]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:18.070 --> 01:29:23.772]  The head of the United Nations forces that would control all arms would always be a communist by agreement.
[01:29:24.512 --> 01:29:32.515]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:29:32.555 --> 01:29:34.236]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[01:29:40.118 --> 01:29:42.681]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:29:43.102 --> 01:29:46.566]  Call now.
[01:29:46.686 --> 01:29:53.033]  Operators are standing by to receive your call for a free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:29:53.653 --> 01:30:01.899]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:02.159 --> 01:30:06.522]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:06.802 --> 01:30:15.728]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:30:15.929 --> 01:30:19.531]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:30:19.651 --> 01:30:20.172]  We're good to go.
[01:30:31.812 --> 01:30:32.453]  What about you?
[01:30:33.113 --> 01:30:38.479]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[01:30:38.539 --> 01:30:39.620]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:41.602]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:30:53.064 --> 01:30:54.765]  What causes foods to spoil?
[01:30:55.185 --> 01:30:58.146]  All produce produces a natural gas which causes ripening.
[01:30:58.486 --> 01:31:03.767]  In addition, foods like onions and garlic emit odors, causing foods to lose their freshness and flavor.
[01:31:04.067 --> 01:31:13.590]  Now there's Forever Fresh for the fridge, a revolutionary new product proven to eliminate refrigerator odors and guaranteed to keep produce fresh at least twice as long as normal.
[01:31:13.890 --> 01:31:16.071]  Nancy McKimson of Jacksonville, Florida says...
[01:31:16.371 --> 01:31:19.914]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, everything stays fresh much longer.
[01:31:20.174 --> 01:31:23.416]  Like strawberries, which now last a couple of weeks instead of just a few days.
[01:31:23.696 --> 01:31:27.239]  Jane Burke of New Jersey says... You know, we eat a lot of salads.
[01:31:27.379 --> 01:31:30.862]  I used to throw out the leftovers because they'd turn brown and they'd shrivel up.
[01:31:31.002 --> 01:31:32.263]  I'm really amazed.
[01:31:32.403 --> 01:31:38.247]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, all my produce stays fresher longer, including the leftovers.
[01:31:38.407 --> 01:31:40.809]  Now I just couldn't get along without Forever Fresh.
[01:31:41.169 --> 01:31:47.610]  To order your Forever Fresh for the fridge, visit the web at foreverfresh.us or call toll-free 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[01:31:47.811 --> 01:31:49.271]  That's 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[01:31:49.291 --> 01:31:56.793]  Last night... I'm going to get back into our... Now we're all terrorists later, but last night...
[01:32:08.974 --> 01:32:13.458]  CNN was going to have Ed Asner on to go public about 9-11 with his views on it.
[01:32:14.759 --> 01:32:17.000]  And he's spoken at the 9-11 Truth Convention before.
[01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:18.441]  He now is speaking out.
[01:32:18.461 --> 01:32:21.244]  Regardless of what you think of his politics, he's very prominent.
[01:32:21.264 --> 01:32:22.485]  You know, Mary Tyler Moore, all that.
[01:32:22.865 --> 01:32:23.686]  And he's going public.
[01:32:24.006 --> 01:32:36.996]  They were going to have a member of the Keene Commission, the 9-11 Whitewash Commission on, and they just last minute, and I believe it was Chairman Keene, CNN wouldn't tell them, but they said it was a prominent member of the commission, canceled about an hour before the live show.
[01:32:38.331 --> 01:32:42.012]  When Mr. Asner was in route to a studio for the satellite uplink.
[01:32:43.152 --> 01:32:44.092]  And so that got canceled.
[01:32:44.992 --> 01:32:48.313]  And then I talked to CNN individuals who were all awake, folks.
[01:32:48.333 --> 01:32:50.193]  This was people at CNN trying to get away with something.
[01:32:50.714 --> 01:32:52.414]  They were like, well, we've been told to kill the story.
[01:32:52.454 --> 01:32:58.775]  We don't know why we're getting record ratings, tens of thousands of emails a day, 53,400 and something.
[01:32:58.795 --> 01:32:59.755]  I've got it here in my notes.
[01:32:59.815 --> 01:33:04.696]  It was 53,400 plus votes in the poll.
[01:33:04.756 --> 01:33:07.077]  Do you agree with Charlie Sheen that the government's covering up what happened on 9-11?
[01:33:09.103 --> 01:33:12.685]  And the poll closed, and it was 83%.
[01:33:13.485 --> 01:33:15.646]  Now, I looked at it hours before it was taken down.
[01:33:15.686 --> 01:33:16.626]  It was steadily moving up.
[01:33:16.726 --> 01:33:18.147]  It had hit 86%.
[01:33:19.028 --> 01:33:22.229]  And then suddenly they pulled the poll after three days of it running.
[01:33:23.249 --> 01:33:30.012]  They pulled the poll with 53,000-plus votes, and when they released it, they said 83%.
[01:33:30.673 --> 01:33:35.015]  That doesn't make sense, but I'm not saying something squirrelly happened.
[01:33:35.035 --> 01:33:35.335]  I'll take 83%.
[01:33:37.794 --> 01:33:39.315]  But I talk to CNN producers.
[01:33:39.355 --> 01:33:39.915]  I talk to them.
[01:33:39.955 --> 01:33:41.375]  They know all about 9-11.
[01:33:42.135 --> 01:33:43.196]  They're totally freaked out.
[01:33:43.676 --> 01:33:44.856]  Because, see, this is show business.
[01:33:44.876 --> 01:33:45.756]  This isn't the news shows.
[01:33:45.817 --> 01:33:48.577]  The news shows have the operatives in it over at regular CNN.
[01:33:49.038 --> 01:33:57.880]  This is the marquee, highly rated show on, you know, the biggest show, even bigger than, you know, that Grace Lady, on Headline News is their show business tonight.
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:33:59.061]  It's their flagship show.
[01:33:59.541 --> 01:34:00.241]  CNN says that.
[01:34:00.811 --> 01:34:01.392]  We're good to go.
[01:34:21.055 --> 01:34:22.935]  Then the next night, they had myself by myself.
[01:34:22.975 --> 01:34:24.096]  Then they had me on the next night.
[01:34:24.156 --> 01:34:26.096]  And last Friday, you got a chance to hear me from Thursday.
[01:34:26.516 --> 01:34:31.898]  This is the report leading up to the six minutes when I was on, on Friday night.
[01:34:31.938 --> 01:34:33.878]  Then we'll play the people that came on after me.
[01:34:33.898 --> 01:34:36.399]  They had some famous feminists on, Mrs. Johns.
[01:34:37.019 --> 01:34:41.360]  I don't agree with some of the things she said about why Bush is a dictator, but she said something incredible.
[01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:43.260]  We'll air that coming up later, too.
[01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:45.361]  But let's go ahead and roll this little piece.
[01:34:45.381 --> 01:34:45.981]  Go ahead and hit it.
[01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:53.663]  On Showbiz Tonight, they're the controversial comments that have got everyone talking, coast to coast.
[01:34:54.003 --> 01:35:00.567]  Taking over four commercial airliners and hitting 75% of their targets, that feels like a conspiracy theory.
[01:35:00.787 --> 01:35:04.750]  Actor Charlie Sheen's startling allegations of a 9-11 government cover-up.
[01:35:05.170 --> 01:35:09.993]  Showbiz Tonight brought you the story first, and tonight, Charlie Sheen is speaking out again.
[01:35:10.013 --> 01:35:10.093]  I am.
[01:35:10.533 --> 01:35:14.418]  Plus, what do you think?
[01:35:14.879 --> 01:35:15.960]  Is he on to something?
[01:35:15.980 --> 01:35:17.602]  Are his claims outrageous?
[01:35:17.942 --> 01:35:21.207]  The overwhelming response flooding our inbox from you.
[01:35:33.616 --> 01:35:36.557]  Welcome to Friday Night at the IMAJ Hammer, live in New York City.
[01:35:37.078 --> 01:35:42.100]  And I'm Brooke Anderson, live in Hollywood, and look who's talking again, Charlie Sheen, AJ.
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:47.443]  That's right, Brooke, the star of one of TV's biggest hits, Two and a Half Men, back on the radio today, and he was talking 9-11.
[01:35:47.783 --> 01:35:54.706]  Now, ever since we first reported Sheen's controversial comments that he made on the Alex Jones Radio Show about a possible government cover-up,
[01:35:55.086 --> 01:35:57.047]  Of what actually happened on September 11th.
[01:35:57.307 --> 01:35:59.127]  The story has exploded.
[01:35:59.207 --> 01:36:03.108]  We have been overwhelmed by the thousands of passionate emails that we've been getting.
[01:36:03.128 --> 01:36:05.969]  We're going to read some of them, a lot of them, throughout the next hour.
[01:36:06.289 --> 01:36:09.110]  Well, today, Sheen called in once again to the Jones Show.
[01:36:09.150 --> 01:36:09.970]  He had more to say.
[01:36:09.990 --> 01:36:12.551]  In just a moment, I'll be speaking with Alex live.
[01:36:12.591 --> 01:36:18.733]  But first, let's listen to what Sheen had to say today about 9-11, about his critics, and about showbiz tonight.
[01:36:20.474 --> 01:36:24.336]  I had a sense that this thing was gonna get hot.
[01:36:25.997 --> 01:36:29.039]  I didn't realize that, as you say, it was gonna go supernova.
[01:36:29.439 --> 01:36:34.643]  Charlie Sheen's comments on a possible 9-11 conspiracy have definitely gone supernova.
[01:36:35.984 --> 01:36:38.686]  And this star is earning both criticism and praise.
[01:36:39.167 --> 01:36:49.116]  Calling into Alex Jones' radio show today, Sheen was sure to heap his own praise on Showbiz Tonight for being the first major news outlet to bring Sheen's 9-11 comments to light.
[01:36:49.617 --> 01:36:52.860]  I have to tip my hat to CNN, to Showbiz Tonight, to A.J.
[01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:56.984]  Hammer for having the courage, for having the guts, for having the wherewithal.
[01:36:57.879 --> 01:37:06.262]  To give someone like myself, someone like you, the actual time and the focus to examine these issues.
[01:37:06.562 --> 01:37:11.504]  I think this is the most attention in mainstream coverage that this topic has ever received.
[01:37:12.004 --> 01:37:16.146]  The response we got today to the incredible story Showbiz Tonight broke last night.
[01:37:16.566 --> 01:37:26.370]  Showbiz Tonight has been on top of this firestorm since it began Monday when Sheen called Alex Jones' radio program to speculate that maybe we weren't hearing the real story behind 9-11.
[01:37:27.250 --> 01:37:37.117]  It seems to me like, you know, 19 amateurs with box cutters taking over four commercial airliners and hitting 75% of their targets.
[01:37:37.497 --> 01:37:39.619]  That feels like a conspiracy theory.
[01:37:40.039 --> 01:37:48.585]  But speaking on the radio today, an angry Sheen went after those who, responding to his 9-11 statements, are now attacking his wild and controversial past.
[01:37:49.305 --> 01:37:55.829]  And the majority of them, in fact 90% of them, were attacking me personally, were attacking my credibility.
[01:37:56.029 --> 01:37:58.030]  I am a citizen that loves my country.
[01:37:59.211 --> 01:38:17.461]  And as a citizen, with my passion for this great country, I demand that I be challenged on the facts, not on immature behavior from 20 years ago.
[01:38:18.241 --> 01:38:23.967]  That if they continue to attack me personally, it only gives credence to our side of the argument.
[01:38:24.568 --> 01:38:25.449]  People want the truth.
[01:38:25.509 --> 01:38:26.209]  They want the truth.
[01:38:26.229 --> 01:38:28.351]  And what's been offered to us resembles nothing of the sort.
[01:38:41.093 --> 01:38:44.495]  Joining me live tonight, the guy who Charlie Sheen has been speaking with on the radio.
[01:38:44.515 --> 01:38:47.877]  I'm talking about Alex Jones, who's joining me live from Austin Tech.
[01:38:48.117 --> 01:38:49.398]  Alex, welcome back to Showbiz Tonight.
[01:38:49.838 --> 01:38:50.599]  Thank you for having me.
[01:38:50.799 --> 01:38:51.900]  Appreciate you being here.
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:55.622]  So, let's talk about the fact that people are going after Charlie.
[01:38:55.662 --> 01:38:59.404]  We've gotten a lot of emails where people are attempting to attack his credibility.
[01:38:59.744 --> 01:39:01.205]  That's the natural thing that's going to happen.
[01:39:01.225 --> 01:39:03.487]  They're talking about things that happened a long time ago.
[01:39:03.567 --> 01:39:04.287]  What about this?
[01:39:04.687 --> 01:39:08.830]  Is his past at all a liability as you see it, or are these attacks basically going to backfire?
[01:39:09.250 --> 01:39:10.171]  Let me just say this.
[01:39:10.431 --> 01:39:11.732]  CNN had a poll a year ago.
[01:39:11.752 --> 01:39:18.776]  90% on CNN, on the Anderson Cooper Show, believe the government's covering up 9-11 and may be involved.
[01:39:19.017 --> 01:39:27.142]  Your new poll, five minutes ago before showtime, 81% of over 20,000 respondents, 81% agree with Charlie Sheen, as I told you.
[01:39:27.442 --> 01:39:31.765]  And they've had many other polls with other news services, and we get the same type of numbers.
[01:39:31.825 --> 01:39:34.847]  On my own talk show and other talk shows I've done, we get the same response.
[01:39:34.887 --> 01:39:37.069]  You have a minority that won't face the facts.
[01:39:37.089 --> 01:39:39.030]  Listen, Charlie Sheen is the first person to go public.
[01:39:39.550 --> 01:39:42.613]  He's just the first Hollywood person to have the courage to do what he's doing.
[01:39:42.913 --> 01:39:45.075]  We have former Reagan administration officials.
[01:39:45.375 --> 01:39:47.036]  We have former Bush senior officials.
[01:39:47.316 --> 01:39:57.104]  We have the current chief economist from George Bush's current administration who quit just a couple years ago and has gone public and he says the government carried out the attacks.
[01:39:57.424 --> 01:40:00.747]  German defense ministers, members of British... Sure, sure.
[01:40:00.787 --> 01:40:02.488]  ...of our cabinet have quit.
[01:40:02.588 --> 01:40:09.474]  Alex, as a Hollywood guy, you know, with a sordid past that he owns up to and it's well behind him, it's going to be an easy attack point.
[01:40:09.494 --> 01:40:13.497]  So, to what I'm asking you... What he says is, don't believe me, check out the facts.
[01:40:13.557 --> 01:40:14.518]  Go look at the evidence.
[01:40:14.778 --> 01:40:15.979]  Don't believe the attack dogs.
[01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:16.540]  Just...
[01:40:17.020 --> 01:40:19.021]  It isn't about Charlie Sheen or Alex Jones or A.J.
[01:40:19.061 --> 01:40:19.321]  Hammer.
[01:40:19.622 --> 01:40:20.982]  It's about NORAD standing down.
[01:40:21.022 --> 01:40:22.283]  It's about bombs in the buildings.
[01:40:22.503 --> 01:40:27.206]  It's about Pentagon documents saying they wanted to carry out these attacks and blame it on foreign enemies.
[01:40:27.266 --> 01:40:28.227]  This is all public.
[01:40:28.507 --> 01:40:37.732]  That's why all these physicists and politicians and Congresswomen, Cynthia McKinney went public three years ago saying there's a cover-up, very suspicious, call for real investigation.
[01:40:38.473 --> 01:40:39.914]  There are hundreds of prominent people.
[01:40:39.954 --> 01:40:40.914]  They just never get attention.
[01:40:40.974 --> 01:40:42.215]  It's getting a lot of attention now.
[01:40:42.495 --> 01:40:46.619]  Charlie Sheen came on your show the other day, and he was back on today.
[01:40:46.719 --> 01:40:51.402]  We know what's going on here at CNN and at Showbiz Tonight because of the thousands of emails that we've been getting.
[01:40:51.703 --> 01:40:52.683]  So let me ask you this.
[01:40:52.764 --> 01:40:56.527]  What do you think now that there is this sort of forward momentum?
[01:40:56.547 --> 01:41:01.831]  What do you think is going to happen now that hasn't happened before as a result of this new level of attention?
[01:41:02.091 --> 01:41:08.114]  Well, I mean, Americans love celebrity, and the average American is obsessed with it more than anybody in the world, except maybe the Japanese.
[01:41:08.654 --> 01:41:18.498]  And he's selflessly sacrificing himself to be attacked just to get people talking and looking at it, because he told me he loves his children, just like I do.
[01:41:18.538 --> 01:41:22.280]  Listen, I get death threats over this stuff, but ideas are bulletproof.
[01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:25.761]  And the New World Order better stop carrying out terror attacks.
[01:41:25.981 --> 01:41:28.842]  We've caught them over 200 times in the last 100 years.
[01:41:28.922 --> 01:41:30.083]  Western government's doing this.
[01:41:30.323 --> 01:41:30.983]  Hitler does it.
[01:41:31.023 --> 01:41:31.783]  The British do it.
[01:41:31.983 --> 01:41:32.863]  The Russians did it.
[01:41:33.384 --> 01:41:34.564]  Governments do this.
[01:41:35.024 --> 01:41:36.225]  And I'm not saying the whole government.
[01:41:36.485 --> 01:41:42.367]  Very small, criminal, black op, black world is what they're called, operators are carrying this out.
[01:41:42.427 --> 01:41:43.007]  That's the fact.
[01:41:43.067 --> 01:41:43.367]  Please.
[01:41:43.647 --> 01:41:45.188]  Go investigate it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:45.428 --> 01:41:46.489]  You will discover the truth.
[01:41:46.529 --> 01:41:47.229]  Look at America.
[01:41:47.289 --> 01:41:48.590]  It's turning into a police state.
[01:41:48.610 --> 01:41:50.451]  They're putting cameras in school bathrooms.
[01:41:50.491 --> 01:41:53.733]  Let's bring it back to what's happening this week and what you and I have been talking about.
[01:41:54.533 --> 01:42:05.539]  And yesterday on this program, you told me, Charlie Sheen, not alone among Hollywood celebrities, you told me that you're, well, you wouldn't name names, you're in touch with quite a few celebrities who feel the same way that...
[01:42:06.019 --> 01:42:09.123]  Charlie feels about what may have actually happened on 9-11.
[01:42:09.483 --> 01:42:17.792]  So my question is, do you think since we've had this uproar this week and Charlie is taking this risk and speaking out, we're going to be hearing from more celebrities who will go public?
[01:42:18.292 --> 01:42:21.316]  Well, I mean, the majority of the American people support Mr. Sheen.
[01:42:21.336 --> 01:42:25.260]  Despite the attack dogs, he's winning the war of polls.
[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:32.870]  And literally, almost everyone I've talked to in Hollywood, very prominent people, I have a lot of friends in Hollywood, and they've all sought me out.
[01:42:32.910 --> 01:42:34.692]  I'm not some Hollywood person.
[01:42:34.812 --> 01:42:37.496]  Is anyone indicating to you that they may actually come forward?
[01:42:37.596 --> 01:42:41.000]  And I asked you yesterday, and I'm going to ask you again, can you tell us a couple of the names of those people?
[01:42:41.241 --> 01:42:42.763]  No, because I have...
[01:42:43.323 --> 01:42:47.188]  They have confidence in me, and I'm not even pushing them to go public.
[01:42:47.268 --> 01:42:49.531]  I didn't push Charlie to go public.
[01:42:49.591 --> 01:42:54.537]  Yes, I think you're going to see more people, and some of them may be people I don't even know.
[01:42:54.597 --> 01:42:58.041]  Listen, everybody in Hollywood I talk to, pick a name, any name.
[01:42:58.081 --> 01:42:59.663]  I've talked to hundreds of them.
[01:42:59.703 --> 01:43:00.544]  They seek me out.
[01:43:00.584 --> 01:43:01.445]  They're aware of it.
[01:43:01.605 --> 01:43:02.406]  They talk about it.
[01:43:03.707 --> 01:43:08.449]  You clearly have a lot of supporters, of course, and you're very familiar with this end of it.
[01:43:08.769 --> 01:43:13.191]  We've gotten the thousands of emails this week, and not all of them, Alex, are glowing, obviously.
[01:43:13.651 --> 01:43:15.852]  But your goal is 81%.
[01:43:15.932 --> 01:43:17.993]  I'm with you on that.
[01:43:18.093 --> 01:43:19.253]  I don't know at this very moment.
[01:43:19.273 --> 01:43:20.594]  We're going to get into that in just a second.
[01:43:21.770 --> 01:43:29.135]  Of course, when this happens, we do get emails saying, oh, you know, we think that people like Charlie Sheen and Alex Jones are whack jobs.
[01:43:29.175 --> 01:43:33.979]  Are you at all concerned that the louder you raise your voices, the wackier you might seem to those people?
[01:43:33.999 --> 01:43:34.459]  You know what?
[01:43:35.054 --> 01:43:35.514]  You know what?
[01:43:35.634 --> 01:43:46.580]  No, I'm not worried, because we have put the facts out there, and I challenge them, instead of just using little buzzwords and junior high mentality propaganda, to actually go look at my claims.
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:52.243]  Is a current Bush administration official, has he quit and said the government ran the attacks?
[01:43:52.623 --> 01:43:52.883]  Yes.
[01:43:52.983 --> 01:43:56.245]  Did Dr. Morgan Reynolds say that, Chief Economist, Department of Labor?
[01:43:56.445 --> 01:44:05.370]  Is Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, the father of Reaganomics, the father of it, who was at the highest levels of the Treasury and the Bush administration, has he gone public saying he questions 9-11?
[01:44:05.670 --> 01:44:08.252]  Sir, the American people are going to learn the truth.
[01:44:08.452 --> 01:44:16.456]  Nothing can stop the truth from coming out on 9-11, and we're in danger of the New World Order carrying out more terror attacks to keep this war for empire.
[01:44:16.576 --> 01:44:24.839]  Well, Alex, I'm out of time once again, but what I appreciate is that you're encouraging people above all else to seek out the facts, and that's what I think you're doing an excellent job at.
[01:44:24.859 --> 01:44:27.360]  AJ, people need to go to Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:44:27.661 --> 01:44:28.541]  I'm risking my life.
[01:44:28.601 --> 01:44:33.603]  We're doing this for the American people and our children and our future, and thank you for having the courage to let me come on.
[01:44:33.743 --> 01:44:34.343]  God bless you.
[01:44:34.543 --> 01:44:36.064]  Alex Jones, live from Austin, Texas.
[01:44:36.104 --> 01:44:36.604]  Thank you.
[01:44:38.125 --> 01:44:38.505]  All right.
[01:44:39.425 --> 01:44:43.487]  Coming up later, I'm going to air the other clip, because the next two guests had questions of 9-11.
[01:44:43.507 --> 01:44:45.588]  They had guests on about completely different stuff.
[01:44:46.614 --> 01:44:47.355]  We're good to go.
[01:44:47.535 --> 01:44:48.336]  We're good to go.
[01:45:06.149 --> 01:45:06.530]  We're good to go.
[01:45:20.578 --> 01:45:28.563]  If you want to learn the truth about 9-11, if you want to be an expert on 9-11, get my film, Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State, the definitive film on 9-11.

[01:45:39.770 --> 01:45:42.112]  It's got FEMA saying that all Christians are terrorists.
[01:45:42.172 --> 01:45:43.513]  I mean, you need this video.

[01:47:53.825 --> 01:47:55.226]  Now is the time to expose 9-11.
[01:47:55.266 --> 01:48:02.730]  I mean, the globalists could carry out terror attacks next week, next month, next year, and then shut down all the alternative media, and all you'll have is the underground DVDs and VHS.
[01:48:04.022 --> 01:48:05.223]  Get copies while you can.
[01:48:05.263 --> 01:48:07.064]  I mean, we're facing straits that dire.
[01:48:07.544 --> 01:48:09.505]  We're dealing with criminals that wicked and that evil.
[01:48:09.545 --> 01:48:13.447]  I was on Alan Combs' radio show Monday night for a full hour.
[01:48:14.707 --> 01:48:16.668]  And I'd say he probably took about 20 calls.
[01:48:17.008 --> 01:48:17.769]  Probably more than 20.
[01:48:18.009 --> 01:48:18.489]  I didn't count.
[01:48:19.149 --> 01:48:21.991]  And I'd say out of 20 calls, five callers disagreed.
[01:48:22.491 --> 01:48:23.411]  The vast majority, 75%.
[01:48:23.871 --> 01:48:26.753]  I mean, I was sitting there counting at the time.
[01:48:26.793 --> 01:48:27.613]  I don't have it in front of me.
[01:48:28.534 --> 01:48:30.074]  What I do on talk shows is I start with a 1, 2, 3, 4.
[01:48:30.214 --> 01:48:31.415]  And I draw a line through it for 5.
[01:48:34.011 --> 01:48:40.087]  So there were, I know there were quite a few calls, and just five callers that disagreed, and they were all mindless.
[01:48:40.107 --> 01:48:41.631]  The callers that agreed were all informed.
[01:48:43.261 --> 01:48:44.302]  And Alan was freaking out.
[01:48:44.342 --> 01:48:47.363]  I mean, everybody was calling in, agreeing that 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:48:47.403 --> 01:48:48.544]  And he said, well, they're so evil.
[01:48:48.584 --> 01:48:50.785]  I mean, a hard time believing the government would do this.
[01:48:50.825 --> 01:48:53.206]  And I said, what about black men in Tuskegee?
[01:48:53.246 --> 01:48:54.847]  What about radiating the G.I.'
[01:48:54.827 --> 01:48:57.388]  's wives that were pregnant in our country?
[01:48:57.408 --> 01:48:59.329]  What about 110,000 Jewish children?
[01:48:59.650 --> 01:49:05.993]  Our government paid $3 billion to Israel to test 110,000 of them in a radiation chamber, and it killed almost all of them.
[01:49:06.253 --> 01:49:07.393]  What about the ringworm children?
[01:49:07.413 --> 01:49:10.295]  Because they told them they were going to be checked for fungus, and they'd radiate them.
[01:49:11.825 --> 01:49:13.306]  In 1950 to 1961.
[01:49:13.366 --> 01:49:14.506]  He goes, yeah, I guess you're right.
[01:49:14.766 --> 01:49:16.006]  Then I was on Talk Sport.
[01:49:16.146 --> 01:49:22.108]  National, British, the biggest private commercial radio network in England.
[01:49:22.508 --> 01:49:23.389]  Millions of listeners.
[01:49:24.749 --> 01:49:28.630]  Every text message, every call that they read on air, everything they covered, everybody agreed.
[01:49:28.650 --> 01:49:29.690]  No one disagreed.
[01:49:29.731 --> 01:49:30.731]  They were all informed.
[01:49:30.811 --> 01:49:34.152]  The host, who disagreed with me three years ago when I was on, was agreeing.
[01:49:35.312 --> 01:49:35.972]  James Whale.
[01:49:37.693 --> 01:49:38.693]  And I just let it all out.
[01:49:38.753 --> 01:49:40.174]  I mean, listen, this is the fact.
[01:49:40.194 --> 01:49:41.114]  This is the reality.
[01:49:42.071 --> 01:49:44.152]  And we're going to expose these murdering creatures.
[01:49:44.812 --> 01:49:45.932]  Get the videos, do it now.
[01:49:46.652 --> 01:49:53.394]  More from CNN as we analyze the piece coming up, and then a lot of other news coming up in the third hour.
[01:49:53.474 --> 01:49:57.856]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.056 --> 01:50:02.497]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.617 --> 01:50:06.998]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:07.038 --> 01:50:08.379]  The New World Order.
[01:50:10.177 --> 01:50:14.399]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.459 --> 01:50:21.383]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.523 --> 01:50:23.584]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:23.884 --> 01:50:34.209]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.530 --> 01:50:35.230]  If you want to understand
[01:50:35.330 --> 01:50:37.172]  That's 888-253-3139 Order today and spread the word!
[01:50:53.863 --> 01:50:56.867]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:50:57.208 --> 01:51:06.039]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:51:06.380 --> 01:51:11.046]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:11.506 --> 01:51:18.229]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:18.629 --> 01:51:30.415]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:30.875 --> 01:51:35.340]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[01:52:30.546 --> 01:52:30.747]  I think?
[01:53:08.062 --> 01:53:19.165]  Well, according to Virginia's anti-terror training manual, trying to influence the government through political activities is terrorism, railing against the crown, it says, criticizing the government.
[01:53:19.845 --> 01:53:28.888]  It actually says that undermining confidence in the government is terrorism, and property rights activists, it's all it says, it says property rights activists are terrorists.
[01:53:30.208 --> 01:53:32.270]  This is being given to everyone in the government.
[01:53:32.390 --> 01:53:35.032]  Everyone in the government in Virginia is getting this from the governor's office.
[01:53:35.512 --> 01:53:37.454]  Obviously federally written, just like all the others.
[01:53:38.074 --> 01:53:38.995]  Just another one of these.
[01:53:39.015 --> 01:53:40.476]  I hope you'll get it and get it out to people.
[01:53:41.177 --> 01:53:43.259]  Meanwhile, the neocons are on the radio lying.
[01:53:43.279 --> 01:53:47.002]  I heard neocons yesterday going, we just need to give in to Mexico and let them take over.
[01:53:47.142 --> 01:53:48.203]  Listen, there's nothing we can do.
[01:53:48.223 --> 01:53:51.785]  I know it's terrible, but we need to get Bush's amnesty plan going.
[01:53:52.106 --> 01:53:55.989]  But they don't call it amnesty, they call it, Bush has a sensible plan to work her visa.
[01:53:57.719 --> 01:53:59.940]  Meanwhile, you go watch Spanish TV.
[01:53:59.980 --> 01:54:00.841]  It's, we're taking over!
[01:54:00.881 --> 01:54:01.581]  This is Mexico!
[01:54:01.621 --> 01:54:02.222]  Ha ha ha!
[01:54:02.242 --> 01:54:07.545]  With just thousands of Mexican flags screaming La Reconquista with signs saying, go back to Europe.
[01:54:08.145 --> 01:54:11.927]  I mean, I've got so many video clips on the website, so many things I've looked at in the last two days.
[01:54:11.947 --> 01:54:15.529]  I mean, we could fill the whole show up just playing these clips.
[01:54:16.650 --> 01:54:17.110]  Think about it.
[01:54:17.150 --> 01:54:18.611]  And then the Senate guts...
[01:54:19.398 --> 01:54:23.881]  The House bill that would make it a felony to start arresting these illegal aliens.
[01:54:24.142 --> 01:54:27.724]  But there are already laws on the books about illegal aliens here violating the law.
[01:54:28.024 --> 01:54:28.985]  They can already be deported.
[01:54:29.025 --> 01:54:29.806]  They're not going to.
[01:54:29.886 --> 01:54:31.067]  More laws won't even do it.
[01:54:31.087 --> 01:54:39.012]  I mean, do you realize, folks, that our government finance media has told these foreigners that this is their country and they're going to take it over?
[01:54:41.234 --> 01:54:42.195]  And they really believe it.
[01:54:42.435 --> 01:54:48.179]  Even though the Mexicans couldn't hold it from the Native Americans, there were only a few thousand Mexicans in Texas, and they certainly weren't in
[01:54:48.922 --> 01:54:51.906]  Kansas and Oklahoma, they're now claiming that's part of Aslan.
[01:54:51.946 --> 01:54:56.692]  And Washington State, only people up there were Native Americans and Russians and Indians.
[01:54:57.514 --> 01:55:00.097]  Native Americans, Russians and British.
[01:55:00.998 --> 01:55:05.284]  But now Oregon and Washington State are part of greater Aslan and they will take it.
[01:55:06.031 --> 01:55:08.772]  And ha ha ha, I mean, it's just craziness.
[01:55:08.832 --> 01:55:19.334]  A foreign mass of foreigners by the millions running around waving flags and up-close placards saying we're going to kick whites out and plan of San Diego shirts on right here in Austin.
[01:55:19.634 --> 01:55:22.115]  Plan of San Diego to kill all white men above the age of 16.
[01:55:22.155 --> 01:55:23.115]  16 and older.
[01:55:23.135 --> 01:55:26.796]  So we're going to be talking about that with Kevin Smith here in the studio.
[01:55:26.836 --> 01:55:27.896]  He's been to these protests with me.
[01:55:27.916 --> 01:55:28.536]  He's witnessed it.
[01:55:28.876 --> 01:55:29.457]  He's covered it.
[01:55:31.277 --> 01:55:33.518]  And these people are just horrible racists.
[01:55:33.578 --> 01:55:34.398]  They hate blacks.
[01:55:34.458 --> 01:55:35.218]  They hate whites.
[01:55:36.053 --> 01:55:37.754]  And I'm not saying all Hispanics.
[01:55:37.794 --> 01:55:39.776]  I'm talking about a large section of the illegal aliens.
[01:55:40.096 --> 01:55:42.218]  And the illegal aliens 20 years ago didn't think like this.
[01:55:42.278 --> 01:55:43.639]  They have been taught this in Mexico.
[01:55:44.019 --> 01:55:46.621]  The government gives the children and the parents comic books.
[01:55:47.421 --> 01:55:48.402]  Because most of them can't read.
[01:55:48.422 --> 01:55:49.323]  They've been so enslaved.
[01:55:49.623 --> 01:55:53.646]  Little simple comic books showing them with pictures how America belongs to them.
[01:55:53.686 --> 01:55:55.387]  And our government's been caught financing that.
[01:55:55.667 --> 01:55:58.009]  Do you understand the magnitude?
[01:55:58.970 --> 01:55:59.870]  The magnitude.
[01:55:59.890 --> 01:56:02.072]  So we're going to cover a bunch of international nationalism.
[01:56:02.092 --> 01:56:04.754]  We'll get back and later get Kevin Smith in here in studio.
[01:56:05.663 --> 01:56:07.104]  You see, you're another voice other than mine.
[01:56:07.624 --> 01:56:12.827]  Tomorrow we should be able to take calls, and we've got all the phone systems in, the T1s, the rest of it, but it's not all hooked up to the board yet.
[01:56:12.847 --> 01:56:14.028]  That's been being done all morning.
[01:56:15.348 --> 01:56:18.610]  I told them, I said, there's no way you can move all that studios.
[01:56:18.630 --> 01:56:19.711]  They had two separate studios.
[01:56:19.731 --> 01:56:22.132]  There's no way you can move that with three people in two days.
[01:56:22.192 --> 01:56:23.673]  And I, of course, was right as usual.
[01:56:23.813 --> 01:56:25.214]  I hate being right all the time, folks.
[01:56:26.094 --> 01:56:27.475]  But they tried as hard as they can.
[01:56:27.515 --> 01:56:29.016]  At least I'm on air right now.
[01:56:29.036 --> 01:56:35.039]  But let me tell you, it was, thank God I could do other radio interviews and be on national radio and do all these other talk shows and
[01:56:35.356 --> 01:56:42.739]  Be on MTV and all this over the phone so I could at least talk some about what's happening the last two days, not being able to do my own talk show.
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:44.180]  But I'm here.
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:46.381]  I'm going to be here for the rest of this week.
[01:56:47.062 --> 01:56:56.386]  Fox TV, by the way, not only CNN canceled interviews yesterday, Fox was going to have me on yesterday, and they called up last minute and go, oh, we don't want you to come down now.
[01:56:56.666 --> 01:56:57.947]  No, we're not going to do it now.
[01:56:57.967 --> 01:57:00.688]  They're going to have me on day side, so.
[01:57:01.232 --> 01:57:05.173]  The order went in to shut these people down, because I'd have gone on Fox and cleaned their clocks.
[01:57:05.733 --> 01:57:06.953]  Just like I did on CNN.
[01:57:06.973 --> 01:57:09.033]  I mean, they put some neocon up against me.
[01:57:09.433 --> 01:57:10.394]  I'm not going to shut up.
[01:57:10.834 --> 01:57:11.854]  I'm not going to back off.
[01:57:11.914 --> 01:57:12.874]  I'm going to clean their clocks.
[01:57:13.474 --> 01:57:15.834]  Not one of these whimpering wimps they put up against themselves.
[01:57:16.715 --> 01:57:17.775]  I'm going to clean their clocks.
[01:57:19.395 --> 01:57:20.195]  Just let me at them.
[01:57:21.055 --> 01:57:21.996]  Turn me loose on them.
[01:57:22.956 --> 01:57:24.376]  Turn me loose, set me free.
[01:57:25.356 --> 01:57:25.876]  As they say.
[01:57:25.896 --> 01:57:28.497]  All right, we'll be back with the third hour.
[01:57:28.537 --> 01:57:29.177]  You don't want to miss it.
[01:57:29.197 --> 01:57:30.557]  It'll be absolutely jam-packed.
[01:57:31.161 --> 01:57:32.502]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:33.463 --> 01:57:37.385]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:37.685 --> 01:57:38.546]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.385 --> 01:57:50.025]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.685 --> 01:57:51.786]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.466 --> 01:57:53.587]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.227 --> 01:57:55.047]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.788 --> 01:57:56.728]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.369 --> 01:58:01.010]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.530 --> 01:58:05.672]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.413 --> 01:58:09.454]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:58:09.614 --> 01:58:10.295]  until 2 p.m.
[01:58:11.575 --> 01:58:12.816]  Central Standard Time.
[01:58:14.116 --> 01:58:16.237]  Back from 9 to midnight, Central Standard Time.
[01:58:16.277 --> 01:58:17.198]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:58:18.965 --> 01:58:26.690]  To recap, the federal government and allied crime syndicates are funding the Mexican-Latin American takeover of the American Southwest as part of the Pan American Union.
[01:58:26.730 --> 01:58:31.253]  Miami will be the new capital, or Atlanta, they're debating it, for the new Pan American Union.
[01:58:31.293 --> 01:58:32.954]  We will be a Latin American country.
[01:58:34.555 --> 01:58:41.560]  They've openly, the globalists have openly said that Canada will be Asian, predominantly Chinese, are to the majority in Canada's two largest cities.
[01:58:42.273 --> 01:58:43.054]  I think we're good to go.
[01:58:56.161 --> 01:58:58.103]  And of course, this is to destroy any middle class.
[01:58:58.143 --> 01:59:03.089]  The poor Mexicans out protesting and Latin Americans will be more enslaved than ever and have nowhere to run.
[01:59:03.109 --> 01:59:04.551]  And it'll be just like Mexico.
[01:59:04.591 --> 01:59:06.393]  They won't be allowed to protest or demonstrate soon.
[01:59:06.774 --> 01:59:09.737]  After they riot and burn a bunch of stuff, we'll lose even more free speech.
[01:59:10.038 --> 01:59:12.040]  And they've built FEMA camps for the foreigners
[01:59:13.041 --> 01:59:15.322]  Which they'll put foreigners in first, then for the American people.
[01:59:15.622 --> 01:59:23.064]  That is mainstream Senate hearings, 1986, Rex 84 plan, and now echoed by the Houston Chronicle and Associated Press in the last two months.
[01:59:23.384 --> 01:59:30.065]  We've written detailed articles on that predicting these riots, and that's exactly what these are, and the media covers up their riots, hoping they'll blow up full scale.
[01:59:30.906 --> 01:59:32.226]  Blacks and whites have been attacked.
[01:59:32.788 --> 01:59:38.252]  Nationwide to confirm, we have photos and clips of this in admissions and local press, Neverman National Press.
[01:59:38.833 --> 01:59:43.837]  Virginia has a training manual saying that all land rights activists, property rights activists are terrorists.
[01:59:44.217 --> 01:59:49.942]  Anyone trying to influence the government who has a video camera trying to videotape any protest demonstration is a terrorist, needs to be arrested.
[01:59:50.342 --> 01:59:52.464]  We are going into total martial law in America.
[01:59:54.105 --> 01:59:55.546]  And that is the bottom line.
[01:59:55.806 --> 01:59:57.908]  And again, we've taken no calls today because we're unable to.
[01:59:57.948 --> 01:59:59.169]  They moved studios over the weekend and
[01:59:59.636 --> 02:00:01.037]  Didn't get it up Monday, didn't get it up Tuesday.
[02:00:01.057 --> 02:00:02.718]  We've been up with the refeeds, thank God.
[02:00:02.738 --> 02:00:04.759]  At least that got done.
[02:00:05.820 --> 02:00:08.121]  And soon we should have the phone lines available.
[02:00:09.542 --> 02:00:10.602]  I can't wait to take your phone calls.
[02:00:11.023 --> 02:00:12.904]  And again, I wish I'd have been here for you Monday and Tuesday.
[02:00:12.924 --> 02:00:13.744]  I was chomping at the bit.
[02:00:14.164 --> 02:00:16.306]  Big developments in the Charlie Sheen situation.
[02:00:16.326 --> 02:00:19.728]  That's all on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:00:20.728 --> 02:00:23.070]  We played my Thursday appearance on CNN last week.
[02:00:23.410 --> 02:00:25.091]  Last hour we played my Friday appearance.
[02:00:25.271 --> 02:00:28.793]  And then I'm going to play the appearance of the next few guests that were on after me
[02:00:29.229 --> 02:00:31.351]  And then comment on their comments afterwards.
[02:00:31.971 --> 02:00:33.853]  This has got the normal liberal spin.
[02:00:33.933 --> 02:00:36.034]  Bush is a dictator because he won't let us have abortion.
[02:00:36.455 --> 02:00:36.955]  No, don't worry.
[02:00:36.995 --> 02:00:39.097]  Bush is trying to block the Dakotas from banning abortion.
[02:00:39.497 --> 02:00:41.018]  Bush, his wife, is pro-abortion.
[02:00:41.038 --> 02:00:43.620]  I mean, I've heard liberals say, oh, Bush is against the Minutemen.
[02:00:44.161 --> 02:00:47.263]  I mean, excuse me, Bush is behind the Minutemen and against amnesty.
[02:00:47.343 --> 02:00:49.565]  No, his plan is total amnesty.
[02:00:50.165 --> 02:00:54.669]  And that's the neocons lie to everybody, so liberals tune in and hear that and think Bush is anti-amnesty.
[02:00:54.709 --> 02:00:57.371]  His plan is total amnesty written by Democrats.
[02:00:58.510 --> 02:01:00.731]  So we'll get into that.
[02:01:01.692 --> 02:01:03.573]  There is just so much more that's happened.
[02:01:03.593 --> 02:01:05.974]  I haven't even gotten into the other stacks of news.
[02:01:06.014 --> 02:01:08.976]  CNN fears 9-11 truth cancels Ed Asner's appearance.
[02:01:09.396 --> 02:01:12.018]  Fox News, should we torture people to prevent terror attacks?
[02:01:13.098 --> 02:01:15.700]  The federal government provides incentives for replacing U.S.
[02:01:15.860 --> 02:01:21.083]  state gasoline tax with GPS distance tax, and they're going to pay you to do it.
[02:01:21.103 --> 02:01:26.646]  And it shows a federal camera on the road scanning cars as they move down the road in real time.
[02:01:27.859 --> 02:01:32.823]  As we told you, and they're going to charge you $3 a gallon in tax.
[02:01:32.843 --> 02:01:34.504]  That's the equivalent of what was a gas tax.
[02:01:34.524 --> 02:01:35.905]  That's the official numbers.
[02:01:35.945 --> 02:01:39.748]  And it's kind of like a crack dealer giving you your first week supply free.
[02:01:40.269 --> 02:01:42.030]  Oh, we're going to pay you to do this at first.
[02:01:43.112 --> 02:01:44.193]  And that's how they domesticate.
[02:01:44.213 --> 02:01:48.296]  You know, it's just like you feed the wild hogs before you capture them in the pen and then domesticate them.
[02:01:48.657 --> 02:01:50.518]  You feed the wild horses before you domesticate them.
[02:01:50.718 --> 02:01:54.962]  You feed the wild bovine, the cows.
[02:01:55.382 --> 02:01:56.543]  This is how you domesticate.
[02:01:56.583 --> 02:01:57.484]  So we'll get into that.
[02:01:57.504 --> 02:01:59.926]  It's also on MSNBC, how wonderful it is.
[02:02:00.887 --> 02:02:03.389]  Workers find more remains from victims of September 11th.
[02:02:03.829 --> 02:02:06.852]  Thirteen-year-old accused of threatening President to be charged and go to prison.
[02:02:07.412 --> 02:02:08.853]  Chavez readies troops to battle U.S.,
[02:02:10.920 --> 02:02:13.081]  And there's a new war memo out where they stage the war.
[02:02:13.121 --> 02:02:14.461]  We've got a whole bunch of those now.
[02:02:15.802 --> 02:02:16.102]  U.S.
[02:02:16.162 --> 02:02:18.502]  rights tells Russia to probe Iraq intelligence leak.
[02:02:19.003 --> 02:02:20.543]  Pillaging the Treasury and the Constitution.
[02:02:20.583 --> 02:02:21.563]  Bush is no conservative.
[02:02:21.944 --> 02:02:24.744]  Farmers snubbed over dog microchips by law.
[02:02:24.764 --> 02:02:26.845]  They're going to make everybody put chips in their dogs.
[02:02:27.585 --> 02:02:28.225]  Total control.
[02:02:28.886 --> 02:02:31.947]  They're now admitting that the top heroin gangs in England are government-run.
[02:02:33.287 --> 02:02:34.987]  Card resigns as White House super staff.
[02:02:36.068 --> 02:02:36.628]  A lot more.
[02:02:36.688 --> 02:02:38.849]  It's all coming up in the next 55 minutes.
[02:02:40.450 --> 02:02:45.012]  Before we terminate this live broadcast today, it's 29th day of March, stay with us.
[02:02:46.173 --> 02:02:49.014]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.274 --> 02:02:50.855]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.195 --> 02:02:55.877]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.197 --> 02:03:02.940]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:03.260 --> 02:03:05.242]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:05.462 --> 02:03:08.304]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.384 --> 02:03:13.068]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.268 --> 02:03:17.671]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight, piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:17.912 --> 02:03:25.137]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:25.378 --> 02:03:27.799]  Discover the documentary truth for yourself before it's too late.

[02:03:45.638 --> 02:03:48.521]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:03:48.861 --> 02:03:51.744]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:03:51.984 --> 02:03:58.190]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[02:03:58.551 --> 02:04:05.858]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[02:04:06.058 --> 02:04:10.142]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[02:04:10.402 --> 02:04:15.943]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.

[02:04:45.096 --> 02:04:49.140]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:04:49.360 --> 02:04:52.764]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:04:52.944 --> 02:04:56.388]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:04:56.661 --> 02:04:59.864]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:04:59.884 --> 02:05:05.409]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we've seen.
[02:05:05.429 --> 02:05:15.078]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:05:15.198 --> 02:05:16.520]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[02:05:16.540 --> 02:05:21.985]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:05:22.481 --> 02:05:26.946]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:05:26.986 --> 02:05:28.368]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:05:28.528 --> 02:05:32.412]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.

[02:05:45.643 --> 02:05:47.824]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:48.425 --> 02:05:51.266]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:51.386 --> 02:05:59.791]  All right, for much of this next hour, I'm going to have Kevin Smith, who works in my office and has been an activist for a long time.
[02:06:00.812 --> 02:06:06.996]  With us, he's gone to CFR meetings they've had at UT called the New World Order Symposium where they openly talk about putting everybody in camps.
[02:06:07.456 --> 02:06:10.018]  We've got video of it, how one world government's coming to America.
[02:06:10.538 --> 02:06:18.462]  And it's going to be done not just through A-bombs, not just through planes flying into buildings, not just through dirty bombs, not just through smallpox or whatever they release.
[02:06:18.843 --> 02:06:20.403]  It's going to be done through race riots.
[02:06:20.604 --> 02:06:29.829]  And again, we have the mainstream media owned by the big corporations openly funding for 20 years telling Latin Americans and Mexicans predominantly that America belongs to them.
[02:06:31.131 --> 02:06:33.698]  And it is a nightmare, and we're now seeing what happens.
[02:06:34.400 --> 02:06:35.483]  And it's a major setup.
[02:06:35.503 --> 02:06:37.569]  We're going to get into that with Kevin here.
[02:06:37.609 --> 02:06:38.351]  We are live, 29th.
[02:06:39.565 --> 02:06:40.206]  Day of March, 2006.
[02:06:40.906 --> 02:06:44.109]  But Kevin, I first wanted to get your take.
[02:06:44.589 --> 02:06:59.041]  You know, we have the FBI training manuals of 99, we have the Gladio, not Gladio, we have the Project Megiddo, we have FEMA on video saying all Christians are terrorists, the Founding Fathers are bad, we have all these cops calling in telling us about it.
[02:06:59.361 --> 02:07:08.489]  Now, mainstream news in Virginia, they're openly published, the state manual, issued by the governor, Warner, who will probably be our next president, if it's not him, it'll be Hillary,
[02:07:09.314 --> 02:07:10.737]  I think Schwartz is out now.
[02:07:10.757 --> 02:07:12.041]  We torpedoed him, thank God.
[02:07:13.083 --> 02:07:13.725]  That Auslander.
[02:07:14.580 --> 02:07:16.161]  So all of this is going on.
[02:07:16.661 --> 02:07:18.663]  And then, of course, I haven't even talked about it yet today.
[02:07:18.763 --> 02:07:20.644]  Friday we mentioned it, but we now got more details.
[02:07:20.764 --> 02:07:31.031]  It is official, admitted, that Hutchinson Wampo, that is taking over Freeport in the Bahamas, is openly communist Chinese military run, captained by them, manned by their troops.
[02:07:31.671 --> 02:07:32.892]  We know they're moving in troops.
[02:07:33.032 --> 02:07:34.393]  Even Washington Times admits that.
[02:07:34.833 --> 02:07:37.415]  And they're taking over the security at a U.S.
[02:07:37.535 --> 02:07:38.416]  possession, a U.S.
[02:07:38.456 --> 02:07:38.936]  protectorate.
[02:07:39.372 --> 02:07:40.112]  It's actually a possession.
[02:07:40.392 --> 02:07:43.974]  They are taking over our bases, and customs is not even allowed on.
[02:07:44.794 --> 02:07:50.556]  I mean, if you think the port deal with UAE is bad, and Dubai Ports World, this is nothing.
[02:07:50.596 --> 02:07:55.078]  George Norrie was freaking out, calling Bush basically a crook when I was on his show last Thursday night.
[02:07:55.678 --> 02:07:59.999]  Freaking out himself, saying he's taking the gloves off, he cannot believe this is happening.
[02:08:00.419 --> 02:08:03.340]  I mean, folks, this is really going on.
[02:08:03.560 --> 02:08:06.521]  And this whole thing with the illegals is part and parcel of that.
[02:08:06.561 --> 02:08:18.524]  But first, Kevin, first, Kevin Smith, I want to get your take, I don't even know what your take is on it, on this latest Virginia manual given to all the cops and all the law enforcement and state employees, period, how to recognize a terrorist.
[02:08:18.564 --> 02:08:18.984]  Kevin Smith?
[02:08:19.845 --> 02:08:24.786]  Alex, I have to say, last summer I saw a Department of Public Safety document for Texas
[02:08:25.515 --> 02:08:27.717]  That was actually even in more detail than this.
[02:08:28.037 --> 02:08:31.039]  It went on the list, anybody traveling in a group.
[02:08:31.259 --> 02:08:33.261]  Did our police officer friend give you that?
[02:08:33.341 --> 02:08:33.581]  Yes.
[02:08:34.162 --> 02:08:35.443]  Why was that not delivered to me?
[02:08:35.603 --> 02:08:37.464]  He only had one copy, and he wouldn't give it up.
[02:08:37.504 --> 02:08:39.206]  But I looked at it, and we can probably get it.
[02:08:39.406 --> 02:08:40.246]  Get it back.
[02:08:40.326 --> 02:08:40.767]  We will.
[02:08:40.907 --> 02:08:48.893]  And it said, you know, if you're traveling in a group, if you're traveling alone, if you use cell phones, if you use e-mails, and basically by the time you were done with this list.
[02:08:48.973 --> 02:08:50.114]  Oh, yeah, if you've got a backpack.
[02:08:50.274 --> 02:08:50.875]  It's everybody.
[02:08:50.895 --> 02:08:52.536]  You know, cameras, old people.
[02:08:53.309 --> 02:08:55.491]  You traveling with a young kid might be a good cover.
[02:08:56.111 --> 02:09:04.897]  And, you know, basic tourist activity, going to a site, a beautiful vista, and taking a photo is now some sort of advanced, you know, terrorist team.
[02:09:04.917 --> 02:09:06.018]  Well, let me just say this.
[02:09:06.058 --> 02:09:10.281]  You know, when I had 35mm cameras, I took some photos, but wasn't as big a photo junkie.
[02:09:10.777 --> 02:09:11.998]  I really am a photographer.
[02:09:12.098 --> 02:09:15.540]  I love... I mean, I carry a little 7 megapixel Sony camera.
[02:09:15.561 --> 02:09:17.502]  I take pictures of everything.
[02:09:17.522 --> 02:09:20.244]  You know, when I'm driving down the highway and see a train coming by, I take a picture.
[02:09:20.284 --> 02:09:23.086]  And then, you know, go home and look at it, and it's the conductor waving at me.
[02:09:23.146 --> 02:09:27.029]  I mean, you know, they're arresting people all the time for having video cameras, and it lists video cameras.
[02:09:27.729 --> 02:09:28.170]  It sure does.
[02:09:28.230 --> 02:09:33.433]  And I also look down on this list, and it says, any racist, separatist, or hate group.
[02:09:33.453 --> 02:09:36.976]  Well, what do you call foreign nationals in another country...
[02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:40.142]  Claiming they're going to bring you down and kill all the inhabitants.
[02:09:40.183 --> 02:09:43.426]  I mean, to me, that seems like the most overt form of terror you can have.
[02:09:43.606 --> 02:09:48.050]  By the way, we went to the Mexican Independence Day parade because I was talking to some of the heads of it.
[02:09:48.070 --> 02:09:49.171]  And they're like, yeah, this is Mexico.
[02:09:49.231 --> 02:09:50.032]  Yeah, we're taking over.
[02:09:50.192 --> 02:09:51.373]  Calling me gringo on the phone.
[02:09:52.094 --> 02:09:57.919]  And so I went down and I just, you know, I mean, you know, we go meet dinner with our Hispanic friends.
[02:09:57.979 --> 02:09:59.821]  And they go, oh, sure, you're Hispanic friends.
[02:09:59.841 --> 02:10:01.543]  No, hey, you're the racist.
[02:10:01.583 --> 02:10:02.163]  But we were there.
[02:10:02.203 --> 02:10:02.804]  What was it like?
[02:10:03.943 --> 02:10:05.944]  It was a surreal thing.
[02:10:05.984 --> 02:10:09.125]  It was one of those deals where, you know, pinch me, am I even awake for this?
[02:10:09.265 --> 02:10:21.110]  And, you know, I really don't understand, you know, I don't see any signs that say, you know, leftist, friend, controller, socialist, we're going to spare you when we do this?
[02:10:21.250 --> 02:10:28.473]  I mean, they scream, go home, gringo, and half the time it's a bunch of little college anarchists that are all Caucasian.
[02:10:28.493 --> 02:10:29.954]  And you watch that at that D.C.
[02:10:29.994 --> 02:10:30.294]  Say's.
[02:10:30.894 --> 02:10:31.715]  We're good to go.
[02:10:48.812 --> 02:10:50.353]  And I was thinking of this the other day.
[02:10:50.373 --> 02:11:00.478]  I couldn't remember us getting into a gang fight during a flag football game because somebody in another fraternity called a racial slur toward one of my fraternity brothers.
[02:11:00.858 --> 02:11:02.318]  And we didn't see color then.
[02:11:02.699 --> 02:11:05.400]  We said, you know, that's my brother, and we're going to fight you.
[02:11:05.440 --> 02:11:16.025]  So, you know, at some level there's a level of tribalism here that, you know, or a bond of association by being through common experiences that brings people together.
[02:11:17.645 --> 02:11:18.686]  My father's British.
[02:11:19.606 --> 02:11:22.147]  I don't have a Union Jack on my truck.
[02:11:22.687 --> 02:11:24.908]  My mother's family is predominantly Texas German.
[02:11:25.268 --> 02:11:27.349]  I don't have a German flag on my truck.
[02:11:28.149 --> 02:11:31.290]  I'm a Texan, and that's the way I view things.
[02:11:31.350 --> 02:11:32.770]  Number one, I'm a Texan.
[02:11:32.810 --> 02:11:33.971]  Number two, I'm an American.
[02:11:34.411 --> 02:11:37.752]  And number three, four, or five, I start to worry about what race I am.
[02:11:38.562 --> 02:11:39.743]  And I just can't understand.
[02:11:39.763 --> 02:11:40.884]  I mean, let's flip this.
[02:11:41.405 --> 02:11:43.006]  Let's go down to Mexico City.
[02:11:43.407 --> 02:11:49.092]  Let's get a million Americans in the street with American flags and scream how we're going to take them all down.
[02:11:49.553 --> 02:11:50.574]  I mean, it wouldn't fly.
[02:11:50.654 --> 02:11:56.479]  And if these people want to take down the gringo or take down these weos, go check Mexico City.
[02:11:56.900 --> 02:12:02.785]  If you go look, your government has a lot of blonde-haired, blue-eyed, tall German names there.
[02:12:02.865 --> 02:12:03.045]  So...
[02:12:04.305 --> 02:12:09.331]  Yeah, Green, Schmidt, I mean, their ruling elite's like two foot taller than the general public.
[02:12:09.371 --> 02:12:10.151]  It's a total joke.
[02:12:10.932 --> 02:12:19.341]  It is, and I was wondering, and these protests got going, and I thought, is there some sort of secret transmission out there that is alerting these people?
[02:12:20.963 --> 02:12:21.984]  Yeah, you said that.
[02:12:23.305 --> 02:12:26.148]  You said, guys, are we still good there at Genesis?
[02:12:28.368 --> 02:12:28.768]  Okay, good.
[02:12:29.088 --> 02:12:31.270]  We're on this new Skype connection system.
[02:12:31.290 --> 02:12:33.431]  We're getting the old lines fixed.
[02:12:33.451 --> 02:12:35.272]  And I just heard a break-up.
[02:12:35.312 --> 02:12:35.732]  Excuse me.
[02:12:36.272 --> 02:12:37.073]  Please continue.
[02:12:38.454 --> 02:12:40.635]  Kevin, you were here a few days ago saying this is a secret transmission.
[02:12:40.655 --> 02:12:41.535]  And I said, yeah, Kevin.
[02:12:41.755 --> 02:12:42.196]  This weekend.
[02:12:42.216 --> 02:12:43.977]  I said, yeah, I was watching Spanish TV.
[02:12:44.717 --> 02:12:46.039]  And my wife, you know, speaks Spanish.
[02:12:46.199 --> 02:12:47.920]  And it was just, we're taking over.
[02:12:48.301 --> 02:12:49.362]  It's over for you.
[02:12:49.702 --> 02:12:53.306]  And the Mexican TV would show that it would be like 90 Mexican flags.
[02:12:53.346 --> 02:12:55.748]  I actually counted it once compared to one American flag.
[02:12:55.788 --> 02:13:01.234]  But then CNN and others and Fox would just show up close the American flags to deceive everybody.
[02:13:02.102 --> 02:13:08.085]  You know, I was watching the news this last weekend, and they had a couple different Hispanic congressmen on.
[02:13:08.205 --> 02:13:18.911]  One from Chicago, who is pro-break the borders down, let's flood the country with the third world population that knows how to be good slaves, good sheeple, that will be easier to manage.
[02:13:19.351 --> 02:13:22.073]  And then we have Henry Bonilla from San Antonio.
[02:13:22.093 --> 02:13:24.334]  I believe it's the 23rd congressional district of Texas.
[02:13:25.037 --> 02:13:31.602]  This man is a long, multiple generation Texan, Hispanic, and he is one of the ones leading Let's Control Our Border.
[02:13:32.142 --> 02:13:37.186]  And they had these two guys debating these arguments, and the one that made sense was Bonilla.
[02:13:37.486 --> 02:13:45.812]  Now, you're going to hear a lot of people in the controlled left or these racist groups call him a coconut, you know, brown on the outside, white on the inside, all these little slurs that...
[02:13:46.212 --> 02:13:46.753]  We're good to go.
[02:14:08.300 --> 02:14:11.023]  Well, we've got to allow them to say that, because they're underclass.
[02:14:11.223 --> 02:14:11.684]  Well, exactly.
[02:14:11.704 --> 02:14:14.267]  We're there, and a bunch of them have got shirts on saying they're going to kill us.
[02:14:14.768 --> 02:14:16.750]  Let's say playing in San Diego with the leader of it.
[02:14:17.150 --> 02:14:18.312]  And they did, folks.
[02:14:18.352 --> 02:14:23.878]  Twenty-plus people were murdered, including children in their beds, when they tried to run it in 1918.
[02:14:24.559 --> 02:14:26.161]  And this really happened, folks.
[02:14:26.221 --> 02:14:28.904]  And then the left's like, but they're allowed to do that, Kevin.
[02:14:29.384 --> 02:14:30.746]  Well, because they're the minority.
[02:14:30.786 --> 02:14:32.668]  And I said, you might want to check your numbers again.
[02:14:33.008 --> 02:14:34.049]  They're the majority.
[02:14:34.070 --> 02:14:38.354]  And they go, well, that doesn't pertain to a number that pertains to a racial.
[02:14:38.394 --> 02:14:39.095]  I said, no.
[02:14:39.115 --> 02:14:41.878]  A majority means percentage of the whole.
[02:14:42.299 --> 02:14:43.360]  And they are the majority.
[02:14:43.400 --> 02:14:45.863]  Yeah, and now in seven states, the majority.
[02:14:45.923 --> 02:14:48.205]  And people go, no, you mean the majority of school.
[02:14:48.225 --> 02:14:48.526]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:14:48.546 --> 02:14:48.866]  The majority.
[02:14:49.146 --> 02:14:49.707]  The majority.
[02:14:50.613 --> 02:15:02.693]  And the other thing is that when we try to talk, and there's a few out there that are starting to open up and listen a little bit, you start to talk to them and you say, well, why do you say the Minutemen, or number one, are you a Minuteman?
[02:15:02.753 --> 02:15:04.817]  No, but I do support their efforts.
[02:15:06.140 --> 02:15:09.163]  But Mr. Gomez, the leader of the Minutemen, he's a racist.
[02:15:09.283 --> 02:15:12.006]  Yeah, and they say, well, this is Bush.
[02:15:12.066 --> 02:15:13.328]  Bush is behind the Minutemen.
[02:15:13.388 --> 02:15:15.250]  I'm like, what news are you looking at?
[02:15:15.610 --> 02:15:16.992]  You know, he wants them all arrested.
[02:15:17.072 --> 02:15:18.313]  He's calling them all terrorists.
[02:15:18.694 --> 02:15:20.295]  He's the one trying to break down these borders.
[02:15:20.315 --> 02:15:20.656]  That's right.
[02:15:20.676 --> 02:15:21.717]  He called them vigilantes.
[02:15:21.937 --> 02:15:25.878]  Yeah, but somehow they have in their head that he's behind the Minuteman.
[02:15:26.138 --> 02:15:30.340]  And then you hear, oh, Senator Cornyn is one of the big leaders on trying to control the border.
[02:15:30.380 --> 02:15:31.020]  Are you nuts?
[02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:33.541]  Are you seeing what these guys are putting forward?
[02:15:33.621 --> 02:15:37.822]  So it's this amnesty work program that you get to work for a while.
[02:15:37.842 --> 02:15:39.303]  It's total amnesty.
[02:15:39.323 --> 02:15:40.503]  It's complete amnesty.
[02:15:40.583 --> 02:15:42.944]  And remember whenever Reagan did it.
[02:15:42.964 --> 02:15:44.864]  Well, that was the time we'll never do it again.
[02:15:44.884 --> 02:15:47.485]  But it's not $6 million this time.
[02:15:47.565 --> 02:15:48.966]  It's $14 million they're claiming.
[02:15:49.006 --> 02:15:49.846]  It's really $30 million.
[02:15:50.779 --> 02:15:54.382]  Again, we're all immigrants, you know, unless we're American Indians.
[02:15:54.422 --> 02:15:57.505]  But the point is, there is six and a half billion people on the planet.
[02:15:57.925 --> 02:16:03.289]  We can't take any more, and when you take tens of millions of people that'll work for dirt, everybody becomes dirt poor.
[02:16:03.649 --> 02:16:04.130]  It's simple.
[02:16:04.750 --> 02:16:10.655]  We're like a lifeboat that can take, say, 20 people, and there's already 40 on board, and the water line's right at the edge.
[02:16:11.195 --> 02:16:13.417]  Exactly, and, you know, is this...
[02:16:14.412 --> 02:16:17.014]  Is this an ingredient that a healthy economy needs?
[02:16:17.835 --> 02:16:19.396]  We have no manufacturing base.
[02:16:19.436 --> 02:16:20.236]  They've shipped that over.
[02:16:20.256 --> 02:16:22.778]  So they said, well, America will be a service industry.
[02:16:22.878 --> 02:16:23.799]  And now that's imploding.
[02:16:23.819 --> 02:16:25.400]  But finish what Bonilla said.
[02:16:25.861 --> 02:16:30.584]  Well, I mean, it's just, it does not, the race card does not hold water on this.
[02:16:30.644 --> 02:16:37.589]  I mean, prominent Texan Hispanics and other Hispanics from other parts of the country are saying this, but they're being drowned out.
[02:16:37.609 --> 02:16:38.670]  But tell them what he said.
[02:16:38.710 --> 02:16:39.651]  You haven't told them what he said.
[02:16:40.411 --> 02:16:41.933]  Oh, I'm drawing a blank a little bit.
[02:16:41.953 --> 02:16:47.858]  You said you were watching him on TV, and he said, Hey, I'm Hispanic, and Hispanics in Texas who are Americans don't like the open borders.
[02:16:48.158 --> 02:16:51.941]  No, they don't like it, and I've seen people... But specifically, you told me what he said the other day.
[02:16:51.961 --> 02:16:52.401]  I didn't see it.
[02:16:52.481 --> 02:16:54.183]  Oh, gosh, it's so much stuff going on.
[02:16:54.323 --> 02:16:55.063]  I'd have to go.
[02:16:55.083 --> 02:16:55.424]  You know what?
[02:16:55.444 --> 02:16:55.924]  We'll post.
[02:16:55.984 --> 02:16:58.026]  We'll go on there, and we'll post some stuff on the website.
[02:16:58.686 --> 02:17:01.529]  Sorry I'm drawing a blank on it right now, but it was the same stuff we're talking about.
[02:17:02.209 --> 02:17:03.529]  It's not a racial issue.
[02:17:04.089 --> 02:17:07.950]  This is a way to drive down the middle class, what's left of it.
[02:17:08.010 --> 02:17:16.372]  But it is becoming one because the Lurican Kistas think it's okay for them to say, call us names, and we're just here trying to live our lives.
[02:17:17.012 --> 02:17:17.532]  Exactly.
[02:17:17.792 --> 02:17:19.673]  But then it's okay to call us names.
[02:17:21.513 --> 02:17:30.195]  We're going to be right back, and Kevin, I want to get more of your take on how the federal government is funding the states to have manuals that say any...
[02:17:31.064 --> 02:17:33.708]  Land rights activists, any property rights activists is a terrorist.
[02:17:34.369 --> 02:17:39.137]  But people running around from a foreign country saying we're taking you over, waving their flags, that's just fine, folks.
[02:17:39.918 --> 02:17:41.180]  And we've got a bunch of other news as well.
[02:17:41.200 --> 02:17:42.542]  We'll talk about CARD resigning.
[02:17:42.562 --> 02:17:43.384]  Stay with us.

[02:19:45.060 --> 02:19:48.521]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:19:48.801 --> 02:19:52.302]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:19:52.382 --> 02:19:56.323]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:19:56.563 --> 02:20:02.704]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:20:03.124 --> 02:20:11.026]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:20:11.446 --> 02:20:16.790]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:20:16.950 --> 02:20:20.713]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:20:21.073 --> 02:20:22.954]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[02:20:22.994 --> 02:20:25.156]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:20:25.416 --> 02:20:30.679]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.

[02:20:44.288 --> 02:20:45.989]  What causes foods to spoil?
[02:20:46.410 --> 02:20:49.372]  All produce produces a natural gas which causes ripening.
[02:20:49.712 --> 02:20:54.995]  In addition, foods like onions and garlic emit odors, causing foods to lose their freshness and flavor.
[02:20:55.295 --> 02:21:04.821]  Now there's Forever Fresh for the fridge, a revolutionary new product proven to eliminate refrigerator odors and guaranteed to keep produce fresh at least twice as long as normal.
[02:21:05.101 --> 02:21:07.303]  Nancy McKimpson of Jacksonville, Florida says...
[02:21:07.583 --> 02:21:11.145]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, everything stays fresh much longer.
[02:21:11.405 --> 02:21:14.627]  Like strawberries, which now last a couple of weeks instead of just a few days.
[02:21:14.907 --> 02:21:18.450]  Jane Burke of New Jersey says... You know, we eat a lot of salads.
[02:21:18.590 --> 02:21:22.072]  I used to throw out the leftovers because they'd turn brown and they'd shrivel up.
[02:21:22.212 --> 02:21:23.473]  I'm really amazed.
[02:21:23.613 --> 02:21:29.476]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, all my produce stays fresher longer, including the leftovers.
[02:21:29.616 --> 02:21:32.018]  Now I just couldn't get along without Forever Fresh.
[02:21:32.378 --> 02:21:40.500]  To order your Forever Fresh for the fridge, visit the web at foreverfresh.us or call toll-free 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[02:21:40.680 --> 02:21:42.681]  That's 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[02:21:45.101 --> 02:21:49.362]  We don't need no education.
[02:21:54.364 --> 02:21:58.085]  We don't need no thought control.
[02:22:12.734 --> 02:22:13.814]  Welcome back.
[02:22:14.594 --> 02:22:23.656]  Kevin, specifically, I just want to get your take on the latest Virginia anti-terror training advisory issued to all the state employees to recognize terrorists.
[02:22:23.676 --> 02:22:28.757]  And it says people with video cameras, people with maps, people demonstrating for property rights.
[02:22:28.818 --> 02:22:30.838]  It says property rights advocates.
[02:22:31.821 --> 02:22:33.102]  I mean, this is the new freedom.
[02:22:33.142 --> 02:22:34.142]  Kevin, give us your take on it.
[02:22:35.003 --> 02:22:42.847]  Well, as you've always said, Alex, this Patriot Act and all the accompanying laws, they're not about some guy wearing a rag on his head in a cave halfway around the world.
[02:22:42.887 --> 02:22:44.028]  They're about Americans.
[02:22:44.048 --> 02:22:45.308]  They're about American citizens.
[02:22:45.368 --> 02:22:55.094]  And as they turn up the heat, as they start to, you know, tighten the noose on us, they have to have these things in place, they think, to control the population.
[02:22:56.155 --> 02:22:58.696]  You know, the Kelo New London decision of last June.
[02:22:59.196 --> 02:23:01.237]  They knew there would be repercussions to that.
[02:23:01.337 --> 02:23:06.278]  And, you know, each time they do something like this, it wakes up a larger segment of the population.
[02:23:06.338 --> 02:23:16.042]  So, congressmen that are in office for two years and are more susceptible to being pushed out of office than, say, a senator, they're seeing the light because they're feeling the heat.
[02:23:16.502 --> 02:23:25.685]  So the version on immigration and controlling the border coming out of the House is much more stronger resolution than what they're trying to do in the Senate right now
[02:23:26.443 --> 02:23:30.904]  So I would say the people have closer ties to the congressmen and they're starting to do something.
[02:23:31.325 --> 02:23:37.266]  The problem is you've got to make sure you're not doing the wrong thing for the right reason.
[02:23:38.107 --> 02:23:44.128]  And now they're going to disguise a lot of these things, you know, like Bush's amnesty plan and all these other things along those lines.
[02:23:44.689 --> 02:23:45.689]  So we really need to...
[02:23:46.764 --> 02:23:54.914]  Forget our preconceived notions and whether we're Democrats or Republicans and just starting to look at these things and saying, wow, is this right or wrong?
[02:23:54.974 --> 02:23:58.479]  Is this what you do for a country that you're trying to protect and save?
[02:23:59.480 --> 02:24:01.603]  Well, I'll just add this for everybody out there listening.
[02:24:03.132 --> 02:24:06.833]  We have, conservatively, 30 million illegal aliens.
[02:24:06.853 --> 02:24:08.214]  They tell you 14 million on the news.
[02:24:08.234 --> 02:24:08.974]  That is not true.
[02:24:09.034 --> 02:24:11.035]  I've seen other private numbers, projections.
[02:24:11.535 --> 02:24:15.236]  Because, I mean, most illegal aliens don't tell the census how many people live in a house, okay?
[02:24:15.597 --> 02:24:18.097]  The numbers, because we looked at state numbers, not just federal.
[02:24:18.538 --> 02:24:19.758]  State numbers are much higher.
[02:24:19.778 --> 02:24:22.319]  They're conservatively double what the feds are saying.
[02:24:22.359 --> 02:24:23.800]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[02:24:24.140 --> 02:24:25.960]  We are totally overrun.
[02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:27.461]  There are more illegal aliens...
[02:24:28.341 --> 02:24:46.208]  In Texas, that I see anywhere, doesn't matter, fancy part of town, poor part of town, doesn't matter if it's Walmart, Target, H-E-B, doesn't matter what time of day, I mean, there are more illegals, you know, the hard-working types with the dirt all over their boots and the cowboy hats, than there are Hispanic Americans, white Americans, black Americans, Asian Americans.
[02:24:46.368 --> 02:24:48.408]  It is unbelievable.
[02:24:48.548 --> 02:24:50.489]  I mean, it's got to be worse than $30 million.
[02:24:51.189 --> 02:24:52.350]  I mean, literally, folks...
[02:24:53.687 --> 02:24:54.188]  It is.
[02:24:54.548 --> 02:24:55.629]  Mexico is here.
[02:24:55.649 --> 02:24:56.610]  This is Mexico.
[02:24:57.111 --> 02:24:58.412]  California is Mexico.
[02:24:58.472 --> 02:24:59.573]  Nevada is Mexico.
[02:25:00.314 --> 02:25:17.630]  And we're going to be just like Mexico, where the cops are corrupt, you don't have any freedom, you're a total peon slave, and while the hard-working parents are out taking everybody's construction jobs or electrician jobs or yard-cutting jobs or fast-food jobs or Walmart jobs or every other job...
[02:25:18.470 --> 02:25:22.594]  Their kids are in the public schools turning into little spoiled brats being taught it's La Reconquista.
[02:25:22.614 --> 02:25:24.515]  And their teachers get up there with Mexican flags.
[02:25:24.535 --> 02:25:25.156]  That's been in the news.
[02:25:25.176 --> 02:25:26.657]  There's classes of Mexican flags.
[02:25:26.677 --> 02:25:28.079]  And they teach Mexican history.
[02:25:28.119 --> 02:25:29.260]  And they say, this is Mexico.
[02:25:29.500 --> 02:25:30.861]  I mean, we're paying for this.
[02:25:31.402 --> 02:25:32.683]  And let me just give you a news flash.
[02:25:32.723 --> 02:25:34.124]  The country's basically already gone.
[02:25:35.223 --> 02:25:39.768]  And, of course, the Mexicans aren't going to get anything out of it, but a bunch of pride that we brought down America.
[02:25:40.188 --> 02:25:43.432]  But it's our big banks and big money that are funding the whole thing.
[02:25:43.492 --> 02:25:46.054]  Meanwhile, they're changing the laws, and I make this point a lot.
[02:25:46.555 --> 02:25:49.298]  They changed the law two years ago to where you don't own your own pension fund.
[02:25:49.318 --> 02:25:51.100]  They're claiming that they can take your pension funds now.
[02:25:51.420 --> 02:25:54.563]  They've already started taking some, but they don't want to panic you to take your money out.
[02:25:55.044 --> 02:25:57.166]  So they're moving slow, but when they drop the hammer...
[02:25:57.686 --> 02:25:59.007]  They know you're going to riot in the streets.
[02:25:59.027 --> 02:26:00.307]  They know you're going to be mad about money.
[02:26:00.327 --> 02:26:01.308]  They know you're going to get angry.
[02:26:01.348 --> 02:26:03.789]  That's why they're saying no video cameras.
[02:26:03.809 --> 02:26:04.790]  Don't videotape police.
[02:26:04.810 --> 02:26:05.430]  You're a terrorist.
[02:26:05.770 --> 02:26:07.271]  Don't demonstrate for land rights.
[02:26:07.291 --> 02:26:07.891]  You're a terrorist.
[02:26:07.931 --> 02:26:09.812]  I mean, they actually... You understand, folks?
[02:26:09.832 --> 02:26:12.934]  And then they're going to let the illegals go absolutely wild.
[02:26:13.783 --> 02:26:14.343]  We're good to go.
[02:26:14.363 --> 02:26:14.804]  We're good to go.
[02:26:31.965 --> 02:26:35.106]  How Ford has a factory and how there's almost no Americans that work there.
[02:26:35.506 --> 02:26:40.447]  They brought in all the former Polish and Ukrainian tank factory crews.
[02:26:40.787 --> 02:26:42.328]  They built hundreds of thousands of tanks.
[02:26:42.348 --> 02:26:42.988]  It was ridiculous.
[02:26:43.308 --> 02:26:49.649]  And these are hard-working folks, but it says they live in one-room apartments, they sleep on the floor on cots, and Ford pulls up with vans.
[02:26:50.369 --> 02:26:58.071]  And they load these skilled, skilled machinists, these skilled factory workers on, and they take them by hundreds of vans every day.
[02:26:58.431 --> 02:27:00.832]  And, man, there aren't any legal alien Mexicans working there.
[02:27:01.445 --> 02:27:02.486]  Because they're unskilled.
[02:27:02.506 --> 02:27:06.128]  There aren't Americans working there getting $45 an hour like you used to to send kids through college.
[02:27:06.629 --> 02:27:06.929]  Nothing.
[02:27:07.570 --> 02:27:17.697]  They're getting $6, $7 an hour and they're living on the floor and they're going to bring in unlimited Indians from India to take all your high-tech jobs.
[02:27:17.737 --> 02:27:20.459]  I mean, this is a total... You think it's bad now.
[02:27:20.779 --> 02:27:26.283]  We're going third world and the globalists say by design that that's what they want to do.
[02:27:27.224 --> 02:27:27.985]  That's what they're doing.
[02:27:28.805 --> 02:27:29.746]  It's happening right now.
[02:27:30.532 --> 02:27:31.133]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:31.193 --> 02:27:31.573]  Stay with us.
[02:27:45.879 --> 02:27:52.245]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:52.445 --> 02:27:57.449]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[02:27:57.790 --> 02:28:05.697]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:05.857 --> 02:28:12.903]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:13.103 --> 02:28:13.323]  Thank you.
[02:28:33.558 --> 02:28:34.741]  866-885-6625 866-885-6625 One more time, that's 866-885-6625
[02:28:45.837 --> 02:28:50.802]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[02:28:51.102 --> 02:28:56.547]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[02:28:56.587 --> 02:29:00.891]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[02:29:01.231 --> 02:29:04.234]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:29:04.554 --> 02:29:07.977]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[02:29:08.317 --> 02:29:17.659]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:29:17.919 --> 02:29:21.420]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:29:21.660 --> 02:29:28.742]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[02:29:45.942 --> 02:29:48.284]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:29:48.524 --> 02:29:50.565]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:29:50.705 --> 02:29:57.749]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[02:29:58.010 --> 02:30:06.615]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[02:30:06.935 --> 02:30:11.619]  Now for the first time, Calvin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.

[02:30:48.351 --> 02:30:48.811]  Don't worry.
[02:30:49.312 --> 02:30:50.832]  This show is documented.
[02:30:51.353 --> 02:30:54.154]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:54.534 --> 02:30:58.016]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[02:30:58.476 --> 02:31:02.538]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[02:31:03.099 --> 02:31:04.840]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[02:31:06.380 --> 02:31:11.843]  All right, folks.
[02:31:12.523 --> 02:31:13.563]  We're back live here.
[02:31:13.683 --> 02:31:16.144]  First day back on since Genesis Mover Studios.
[02:31:16.164 --> 02:31:17.625]  We'll be able to take your calls tomorrow.
[02:31:17.645 --> 02:31:19.106]  A lot of three-ring circus.
[02:31:19.146 --> 02:31:20.226]  About a ten-ring circus.
[02:31:20.966 --> 02:31:24.128]  Or like a, what do they call it, a big fire drill, basically.
[02:31:24.148 --> 02:31:26.048]  Now, we're back live here.
[02:31:26.088 --> 02:31:26.929]  Come up before the show ends.
[02:31:26.949 --> 02:31:29.610]  I'm going to air the rest of that CNN piece from Friday.
[02:31:30.518 --> 02:31:47.088]  And they, of course, gave the poll results on Monday and said the vast majority of their emails, I believe the government was involved, not just questioning the official story, and 53,400 plus, you can go read the exact results on the CNN poll, 83% when it closed.
[02:31:47.108 --> 02:31:48.168]  The hours before it closed, it was 86%.
[02:31:48.269 --> 02:31:52.291]  Very suspicious that it went down three points, I believe, Charlie Sheen.
[02:31:53.071 --> 02:31:56.073]  And what he's been saying is you've got to commend Charlie.
[02:31:56.934 --> 02:31:59.095]  And at the same time, they're going to have Ed Asner on,
[02:32:00.723 --> 02:32:07.508]  Last night and others, and they canceled it, because whoever was coming on from the King Commission, the 9-11 Commission, the Whitewash Commission, to debate them, canceled.
[02:32:07.528 --> 02:32:10.610]  Then they got a call from IRF-CNN people, and they said, kill it.
[02:32:10.710 --> 02:32:11.811]  You're not doing that story anymore.
[02:32:11.871 --> 02:32:12.372]  Get off of it.
[02:32:12.932 --> 02:32:15.514]  Despite the fact that we're getting the highest ratings that show's ever had.
[02:32:15.974 --> 02:32:21.939]  So we're going to air this little piece where they had, well, that Johns lady, the famous feminist on.
[02:32:23.640 --> 02:32:27.963]  Well, again, I wouldn't agree with her on most issues, but they just cut to their next guest and say, what do you think of this?
[02:32:27.983 --> 02:32:28.984]  She goes, oh, yeah, I agree.
[02:32:29.835 --> 02:32:32.256]  And then the next person comes on and says, yeah, I agree.
[02:32:32.296 --> 02:32:35.377]  And the next person comes on and says, yeah, the government's not telling the truth about 9-11.
[02:32:35.477 --> 02:32:36.778]  That's New York Magazine.
[02:32:37.258 --> 02:32:46.981]  I mean, how long is that clip, so I know when to go to it, with how much time that we... Okay, so we'll air that in a few minutes and continue.
[02:32:47.001 --> 02:32:48.762]  Kevin, you were going to comment?
[02:32:49.438 --> 02:32:56.161]  Yeah, we were watching that after you went off the air on Showbiz Tonight, and the next guest came on, you know, tell us about your book.
[02:32:56.201 --> 02:32:59.242]  She wrote The Fear of Flying, and she is a feminist leftist.
[02:32:59.382 --> 02:33:01.783]  And tell us about your book.
[02:33:01.843 --> 02:33:03.464]  You slept with Martha Stewart's husband.
[02:33:03.504 --> 02:33:05.325]  You broke up their marriage.
[02:33:05.345 --> 02:33:07.806]  And he goes, hey, what did you think about the Charlie Sheen thing?
[02:33:08.566 --> 02:33:09.566]  Our jaws hit the floor.
[02:33:09.707 --> 02:33:10.527]  We couldn't believe it.
[02:33:10.587 --> 02:33:13.528]  She goes out and says, oh, it's obvious that Bush is a dictator.
[02:33:13.768 --> 02:33:15.029]  She starts quoting Goebbels.
[02:33:15.069 --> 02:33:15.369]  She says...
[02:33:15.829 --> 02:33:18.010]  This is the way they've always done it, even back in Rome.
[02:33:18.050 --> 02:33:19.771]  You keep the population in fear.
[02:33:20.952 --> 02:33:22.813]  We were looking around each other, pinching each other.
[02:33:22.853 --> 02:33:24.093]  I was like, is this happening?
[02:33:24.573 --> 02:33:25.174]  Is this happening?
[02:33:25.194 --> 02:33:26.174]  A.J.
[02:33:26.214 --> 02:33:30.576]  Hammer was pushing you, he wants you to tell me some more names, tell me some more Hollywood people.
[02:33:31.057 --> 02:33:33.978]  Well, you don't have to have them come out and say it.
[02:33:34.691 --> 02:33:35.932]  Look at their body of works.
[02:33:36.012 --> 02:33:36.872]  Look what they're doing.
[02:33:37.332 --> 02:33:41.294]  What did Revenge of the Sith through George Lucas tell you?
[02:33:41.634 --> 02:33:43.895]  What did Kevin Costner's Open Range tell you?
[02:33:43.915 --> 02:33:47.637]  What did Joss Whedon's Serenity and Firefly series tell you?
[02:33:47.777 --> 02:33:50.158]  What are they trying to tell you through their craft?
[02:33:50.598 --> 02:33:51.858]  You don't have to have them.
[02:33:52.679 --> 02:33:54.059]  What did V for Vendetta say?
[02:33:54.399 --> 02:33:54.900]  Even better.
[02:33:54.980 --> 02:33:55.880]  Just saw it last week.
[02:33:55.900 --> 02:33:58.621]  I left V for Vendetta walking on a cloud.
[02:33:59.202 --> 02:34:00.042]  I mean, I said...
[02:34:00.749 --> 02:34:01.450]  We're going to win.
[02:34:01.630 --> 02:34:08.935]  Well, let me tell you what's happening, and I can't get into details, but major Hollywood people are being pressured big time to shut up.
[02:34:09.175 --> 02:34:10.757]  I mean, if I can only tell you folks.
[02:34:11.337 --> 02:34:20.284]  And I did confirm from a very prominent 9-11 leader that one of the biggest musicians in the world, one of the most beloved, is very close to going public.
[02:34:20.324 --> 02:34:22.145]  In fact, he says, tell me what to do, I'll go public.
[02:34:22.165 --> 02:34:23.426]  Well, you should tell him to go public now!
[02:34:24.319 --> 02:34:26.060]  And just the other people.
[02:34:26.120 --> 02:34:28.821]  I mean, you couldn't believe the Hollywood names, folks.
[02:34:28.921 --> 02:34:30.202]  It's unbelievable.
[02:34:30.902 --> 02:34:36.105]  And it is so close, and they're watching to see what happens with Charlie Sheen, who hit the barbed wire for us.
[02:34:36.465 --> 02:34:38.726]  But again, CNN wouldn't have had Azran on last night.
[02:34:38.746 --> 02:34:40.147]  They were going to have him, and they canceled it.
[02:34:40.707 --> 02:34:42.468]  They canceled because they cannot deal with it.
[02:34:43.021 --> 02:34:48.002]  Well, I think it's, you know, we have to be very smart in our strategy here, and I think we are.
[02:34:48.402 --> 02:34:50.763]  You know, we need some sizzle with our steak.
[02:34:50.803 --> 02:35:04.567]  We've got plenty of steak, so when you bring a Charlie Sheen up, or you bring an Ed Asner up, it's good to have a Sandra Hicks right next to him, a Webster Tarpley, a Paul Craig Roberts, you know, somebody with a meat and potato, so you can't just dismiss it as some Hollywood liberal type, but...
[02:35:05.027 --> 02:35:10.210]  The thing that impresses us all so much about Charlie is that the guy's got a ton of baggage.
[02:35:10.590 --> 02:35:15.172]  You know, if anybody could be criticized and they're going to do their worst, they did it to him.
[02:35:15.372 --> 02:35:15.972]  And that's it?
[02:35:16.393 --> 02:35:17.213]  That's all it is?
[02:35:17.713 --> 02:35:21.615]  I mean, remember what they did to Mel Gibson when he tried to bring out Passion of Christ.
[02:35:21.995 --> 02:35:26.777]  Would have been a small art house movie, would have been out for a month and gone.
[02:35:26.838 --> 02:35:30.939]  But because they tried to squash it like they did... Made a billion dollars.
[02:35:31.080 --> 02:35:32.220]  Made a billion dollars.
[02:35:32.520 --> 02:35:33.821]  I mean, what Charlie Sheen did...
[02:35:34.381 --> 02:35:37.083]  And others have done is just what our founding fathers did.
[02:35:37.463 --> 02:35:41.165]  They pledged their fortune, you know, their honor, and their lives.
[02:35:41.846 --> 02:35:44.327]  And that's exactly... Well, I mean, I had Charlie on.
[02:35:44.347 --> 02:35:45.888]  He was talking about our God-given rights.
[02:35:45.928 --> 02:35:46.749]  And the guy's changed.
[02:35:46.769 --> 02:35:47.329]  He's a father.
[02:35:47.889 --> 02:35:51.492]  And so decades ago, I guess it was over ten years ago, I mean, he was partying.
[02:35:52.552 --> 02:35:54.493]  And, you know, out with all these wild women.
[02:35:54.513 --> 02:35:59.794]  I mean, just, you know, basically with $10,000 an hour, these are like supermodels.
[02:36:00.134 --> 02:36:01.354]  I mean, just a wild guy.
[02:36:01.874 --> 02:36:02.775]  And it doesn't matter.
[02:36:02.795 --> 02:36:05.615]  I mean, in that case, Arnold Schwarzenegger's in gay porn.
[02:36:05.875 --> 02:36:07.396]  Arnold Schwarzenegger's groping women.
[02:36:07.436 --> 02:36:09.256]  Arnold Schwarzenegger's having sex with all these women.
[02:36:09.556 --> 02:36:11.377]  Arnold Schwarzenegger's saying he admires Hitler.
[02:36:11.717 --> 02:36:14.157]  Arnold Schwarzenegger says he hates Christians and they're stupid.
[02:36:14.417 --> 02:36:15.238]  In his own book...
[02:36:16.918 --> 02:36:18.980]  You cut that hypocrisy with a knife, couldn't you?
[02:36:19.040 --> 02:36:21.742]  And speaking of, I look at this Virginia memo here on the terrorist training manual.
[02:36:39.981 --> 02:36:43.585]  And it says terrorists have the following goals in mind when committing their acts.
[02:36:43.826 --> 02:36:44.847]  Influencing government.
[02:36:44.967 --> 02:36:47.810]  Creating an atmosphere of anxiety amongst the public.
[02:36:48.111 --> 02:36:51.955]  Well, I would say our government is the number one leader in that right now.
[02:36:52.055 --> 02:36:54.798]  Yeah, but they do it to misdirect us.
[02:36:55.299 --> 02:36:56.040]  Let me comment on this.
[02:36:57.026 --> 02:37:02.010]  They do it to misdirect us, but at the same time, we are trying to create anxiety here.
[02:37:02.030 --> 02:37:07.774]  We've got millions of foreigners, illegal aliens, running around with their flags saying, get out, pilgrim, we're taking over.
[02:37:08.035 --> 02:37:10.677]  Planet Aslan, we're going to kill every white male above the age of 16.
[02:37:10.777 --> 02:37:13.459]  I mean, is that anxiety?
[02:37:13.779 --> 02:37:15.801]  And then it says, yeah, it continues, influence government.
[02:37:15.821 --> 02:37:16.281]  Go ahead, Kevin.
[02:37:17.242 --> 02:37:19.664]  You know, undermine the confidence in government.
[02:37:19.704 --> 02:37:23.667]  I think the government's done the best job in undermining our confidence than anyone.
[02:37:24.067 --> 02:37:26.589]  And then influence government or social policy.
[02:37:27.473 --> 02:37:29.214]  We're trying to cling on.
[02:37:29.314 --> 02:37:30.195]  We're supposed to do that.
[02:37:30.495 --> 02:37:31.815]  Yeah, I mean, that's our job.
[02:37:31.855 --> 02:37:35.237]  And if we don't like the way the government is, we're supposed to throw it out and start another one.
[02:37:35.737 --> 02:37:38.359]  And they say, you know, anybody anti-government?
[02:37:38.739 --> 02:37:42.741]  Well, I think the people that created this government were the most anti-government people ever.
[02:37:42.821 --> 02:37:44.482]  That's why they built the checks and balances.
[02:37:45.002 --> 02:37:45.702]  And they know that.
[02:37:45.742 --> 02:37:49.304]  That's why FEMA demonizes the founding fathers.
[02:37:49.624 --> 02:37:52.025]  Let's go ahead and play this CNN piece.
[02:37:52.065 --> 02:37:57.028]  And the first one is the famous feminist, Johns, and her new stupid-sounding book, Seducing the Demon.
[02:37:57.449 --> 02:37:59.311]  You know, how we can all be really good little liberals here.
[02:37:59.672 --> 02:38:04.057]  But the point is that they had them on for separate issues, and their guests are like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:38:04.337 --> 02:38:11.846]  So let's go ahead and roll that, and we'll be right back with some more comments to wrap up this first broadcast out of the new Genesis Studios.
[02:38:12.206 --> 02:38:12.607]  Stay with us.
[02:38:14.265 --> 02:38:15.446]  A fired up show tonight.
[02:38:15.626 --> 02:38:16.847]  It really is exciting.
[02:38:16.867 --> 02:38:30.298]  We were speaking a few moments ago about Charlie Sheen coming forward this week with his notion that the government may actually have been behind September 11th and the September 11th attacks and the conspiracy theories in general surrounding 9-11.
[02:38:30.338 --> 02:38:35.142]  What do you make of an actor of his stature coming out publicly like that?
[02:38:35.322 --> 02:38:44.866]  I think he's a brave man to even question this aloud in an environment where people have been saying that anyone who questions the government is a traitor.
[02:38:45.446 --> 02:38:49.788]  So Charlie Sheen has done his homework and he's asking questions.
[02:38:50.268 --> 02:38:53.609]  He's speaking truth to power, which is a brave thing to do.
[02:38:54.050 --> 02:39:04.674]  Look, the young people in my family, my nephews for example, have been saying for the past three, four years that we are not learning everything about 9-11 that we're meant to learn.
[02:39:05.234 --> 02:39:15.718]  And specifically, they've been saying that if you read all the different websites, if you're really careful, what you discover is that a lot of facts don't add up.
[02:39:15.898 --> 02:39:26.902]  And even if a modicum of what is being put out there, all these conspiracy theories, even if a piece of that is true, we have a responsibility, don't you think, to be asking the questions and to be doing the investigation?
[02:39:26.942 --> 02:39:29.623]  I think it's very patriotic to investigate it.
[02:39:30.263 --> 02:39:37.849]  Throughout all of history, the basic premise of tyrants has been dictators, shall we say.
[02:39:38.229 --> 02:39:41.212]  And I think it's fair to say that George W. Bush is a dictator.
[02:39:42.092 --> 02:39:47.857]  Has been, if you tell the people they have an external enemy, they'll follow you anywhere.
[02:39:48.497 --> 02:39:52.681]  That was what Goebbels told Hitler to do back in ancient history.
[02:39:52.761 --> 02:39:54.502]  That's what Roman emperors did.
[02:39:54.602 --> 02:39:56.524]  That's a pretty strong statement for you to say, though.
[02:39:56.564 --> 02:39:58.465]  Are you at all fearful of a backlash?
[02:39:58.485 --> 02:40:01.088]  I mean, seriously, a lot of people are afraid to come out on television.
[02:40:01.108 --> 02:40:02.489]  You just called Mr. Bush a dictator.
[02:40:02.669 --> 02:40:04.350]  I think that he is a dictator.
[02:40:04.550 --> 02:40:07.933]  And yet he blithely goes on ignoring the will of the people.
[02:40:08.434 --> 02:40:09.615]  I call that a dictator.
[02:40:10.035 --> 02:40:17.081]  But as far as 9-11 is concerned, it's a great gambit to tell the people, you have an external enemy.
[02:40:17.975 --> 02:40:20.377]  The external enemy is terrorism.
[02:40:20.857 --> 02:40:23.479]  We have a war that will go on for centuries.
[02:40:23.800 --> 02:40:25.961]  It will go on till the end of time.
[02:40:26.202 --> 02:40:30.785]  Well, that's a great way to scare people and to make them believe whatever you say.
[02:40:31.366 --> 02:40:33.808]  And Bush is not the first to do it.
[02:40:34.208 --> 02:40:40.093]  Throughout history, people have been doing that in order to fool all of the people all of the time.
[02:40:40.573 --> 02:40:46.478]  So I think that Charlie Sheen is really patriotic and brave to ask these questions.
[02:40:46.958 --> 02:40:49.779]  I don't know what the answer to these questions is.
[02:40:50.359 --> 02:40:57.140]  I read the article in New York Magazine, and I think just asking questions is brave and patriotic.
[02:40:57.200 --> 02:41:00.481]  And as I mentioned, we'll be speaking with that author from New York Magazine coming up a bit later in the show.
[02:41:00.501 --> 02:41:02.461]  Well, I think it's great that you're investigating.
[02:41:03.001 --> 02:41:04.202]  I don't know what the answer is.
[02:41:04.542 --> 02:41:05.922]  I don't know if we'll ever know.
[02:41:05.942 --> 02:41:09.523]  I don't know the answer to the Kennedy assassination.
[02:41:10.463 --> 02:41:17.091]  But I think that it's a job of writers and of talented people to investigate this stuff.
[02:41:17.411 --> 02:41:19.293]  We were talking about Charlie Sheen in all the comments.
[02:41:19.313 --> 02:41:20.314]  I just had to get your take.
[02:41:20.334 --> 02:41:22.336]  I mean, you seem a little blown away that he would come forward.
[02:41:22.596 --> 02:41:23.597]  Well, it's impressive.
[02:41:23.638 --> 02:41:28.523]  I mean, it's impressive for somebody in any kind of high-profile position to challenge the government when you're getting...
[02:41:29.526 --> 02:41:32.828]  Average people, you know, slandered for any kind of opposition.
[02:41:32.888 --> 02:41:34.089]  Would you ever do something like that?
[02:41:34.109 --> 02:41:34.749]  I probably wouldn't.
[02:41:34.769 --> 02:41:37.150]  I usually keep my politics to private conversations.
[02:41:37.230 --> 02:41:47.236]  But I appreciate the fact that he's prepared and coming out and saying this is something... And I like that he says, if you want to investigate anything, investigate the facts.
[02:41:47.276 --> 02:41:50.318]  Don't try and turn it around on me, which is what's been happening so much with this administration.
[02:41:50.678 --> 02:41:58.561]  Anybody who challenges anything with a reasonable challenge gets slandered and criticized for being, uh, for posing.
[02:41:58.781 --> 02:42:04.003]  New York Magazine is out with a story on all of the 9-11 conspiracy theories that are floating out there.
[02:42:04.023 --> 02:42:06.344]  It's called the Ground Zero Grassy Knoll.
[02:42:06.724 --> 02:42:08.745]  Contributing editor Mark Jacobson wrote the piece.
[02:42:09.085 --> 02:42:10.445]  Mark's joining us live on show this night.
[02:42:10.465 --> 02:42:11.386]  Mark, thanks for stopping in.
[02:42:11.786 --> 02:42:12.226]  No problem.
[02:42:12.486 --> 02:42:17.749]  It's quite an explosion that has happened here this week as a result of Charlie Sheen's comments on this radio show on Monday.
[02:42:17.789 --> 02:42:20.271]  You started working on this story a few months back.
[02:42:20.591 --> 02:42:22.572]  People weren't really talking about this.
[02:42:22.752 --> 02:42:26.955]  Well, not the people that are interested in it were talking about it, but everybody else thought it was out of my mind.
[02:42:27.615 --> 02:42:37.161]  So do you think now that you have a big Hollywood star who is taking an undeniable risk by coming forward, do you think this is going to give it legs and suddenly people are really going to start...
[02:42:37.561 --> 02:42:38.182]  Paying it more attention?
[02:42:38.202 --> 02:42:42.925]  I think it would be better if it was Martin Sheen rather than Charlie Sheen because he's the president, right?
[02:42:43.306 --> 02:42:44.086]  Sometimes we wish.
[02:42:44.427 --> 02:42:45.748]  Well, you know.
[02:42:45.788 --> 02:42:55.555]  But, I mean, it's just one of those kind of things where you do this work and nobody really cares, but then Charlie Sheen is interested, so then everybody's interested, and that's fine.
[02:42:55.716 --> 02:42:57.197]  I think it obviously...
[02:42:58.248 --> 02:43:01.069]  This material needs to be looked at again.
[02:43:01.089 --> 02:43:04.610]  Because there's been a lot of problems with the 9-11 Commission Report.
[02:43:04.970 --> 02:43:06.191]  People feel it's not adequate.
[02:43:06.551 --> 02:43:10.692]  Most of the people that lost people during that time feel it's not adequate.
[02:43:11.452 --> 02:43:15.273]  And it's just... I think we're living in a truth vacuum, in a sense.
[02:43:15.914 --> 02:43:20.355]  That any time there's a truth vacuum, these ideas... The people are smart.
[02:43:21.064 --> 02:43:22.146]  They put two and two together.
[02:43:22.166 --> 02:43:23.167]  Sometimes they get five.
[02:43:23.288 --> 02:43:24.309]  Sometimes they get twelve.
[02:43:24.910 --> 02:43:26.412]  Sometimes they get eleven, like 9-11.
[02:43:26.693 --> 02:43:28.175]  But sometimes they get four.
[02:43:28.335 --> 02:43:34.285]  And the thing is that if you have a situation where the so-called facts are covered up,
[02:43:35.208 --> 02:43:37.509]  I am an American citizen who loves my country.
[02:43:58.158 --> 02:44:16.409]  And as a citizen, with my passion for this great country, I demand that I be challenged on the facts, not on immature behavior from 20 years ago.
[02:44:17.209 --> 02:44:23.097]  That if they continue to attack me personally, it only gives credence to our side of the argument.
[02:44:23.217 --> 02:44:24.018]  So what do you think about that?
[02:44:24.038 --> 02:44:30.888]  Do you think that his credibility really is at stake here, or is that going to backfire on people who are... It's kind of like apples and oranges to me.
[02:44:30.948 --> 02:44:32.269]  It doesn't have anything to do with each other.
[02:44:32.309 --> 02:44:33.972]  It's just like, so he was a...
[02:44:34.592 --> 02:44:36.753]  He was an ardent customer of Heidi Fleiss.
[02:44:36.833 --> 02:44:40.675]  I mean, I can't see how that affects his ability to analyze this material.
[02:44:40.715 --> 02:44:47.878]  People were smart enough, I think, to think about, you know, okay, if he's coming forward with legitimate points, then why should we worry about what his past was?
[02:44:48.458 --> 02:44:49.558]  I think it's just stupid.
[02:44:50.699 --> 02:44:55.541]  You've paid attention to some of what Charlie has had to say this week about what he thinks happened on September 11th.
[02:44:55.581 --> 02:44:56.901]  You did the research for your article.
[02:44:57.201 --> 02:44:58.962]  Do you think he has some legitimate points?
[02:44:59.102 --> 02:45:00.643]  I think he's doing a good job.
[02:45:02.131 --> 02:45:06.954]  A reasonable rendition of what other people that believe in this stuff say.
[02:45:07.694 --> 02:45:11.957]  And when he says he has his facts straight, I mean, I think the facts are in question.
[02:45:12.737 --> 02:45:17.580]  I mean, I think just because you know what it says on all these different websites doesn't mean that that's necessarily the fact.
[02:45:18.140 --> 02:45:28.126]  That's the reason why the government, the United States government, with their endless amounts of resources, let us down by not doing the proper work on the 9-11 Commission.
[02:45:28.606 --> 02:45:29.567]  That's the real problem.
[02:45:30.319 --> 02:45:37.845]  Well, one thing that is interesting, you know, not just your article also bringing some of these theories to light, but the Internet now has changed everything.
[02:45:37.865 --> 02:45:38.926]  It's all over the Internet.
[02:45:39.266 --> 02:45:40.387]  It's all over the blogs.
[02:45:40.567 --> 02:45:45.791]  It seems like this is now an unstoppable movement that's getting some new juice this week from Charlie Sheen.
[02:45:46.131 --> 02:45:47.492]  Do you think this is all a good thing?
[02:45:47.533 --> 02:45:52.596]  I think people might want to consider the Kennedy assassination thing if they had the Internet at the time.
[02:45:53.057 --> 02:45:54.718]  You can imagine how that would have exploded.
[02:45:54.738 --> 02:45:55.619]  But the thing is, like,
[02:45:56.179 --> 02:46:02.762]  If you remember the Oliver Stone movie, which was a JFK movie, I think it didn't get made until more than 20 years after the Kennedy assassination.
[02:46:03.102 --> 02:46:05.363]  Obviously, things are moving quite faster now.
[02:46:05.983 --> 02:46:09.265]  And, yeah, the Internet spreads these things.
[02:46:09.285 --> 02:46:11.726]  Also, the downside of it is it spreads a lot of rumors.
[02:46:11.766 --> 02:46:12.146]  That's true.
[02:46:12.346 --> 02:46:15.087]  And it can certainly perpetuate some things that are not true.
[02:46:15.107 --> 02:46:16.007]  Mark, I appreciate it.
[02:46:16.087 --> 02:46:17.908]  It's really a good read in the magazine.
[02:46:17.948 --> 02:46:19.489]  I appreciate you dropping by to talk about it with us.
[02:46:20.089 --> 02:46:21.930]  Mark Jacobson joining us from New York Magazine.
[02:46:22.370 --> 02:46:27.196]  And we've been asking you to vote on our showbiz tonight, Question of the Day, asking, Charlie Sheen speaks out.
[02:46:27.216 --> 02:46:30.099]  Do you agree there isn't a government cover-up of 9-11?
[02:46:30.160 --> 02:46:32.022]  Well, here's some of the emails that we've received.
[02:46:32.262 --> 02:46:33.604]  We heard from Fernando in Florida.
[02:46:33.644 --> 02:46:40.372]  He writes, Sheen is correct to pursue and expose the matter to all, because the rabbit hole is deeper than we all think.
[02:46:40.752 --> 02:46:42.033]  I just heard from Barbara in Missouri.
[02:46:42.073 --> 02:46:49.036]  She writes, I don't believe the government was involved in the 9-11 terror attacks, and I think that anyone that does is stupid.
[02:46:49.536 --> 02:46:57.140]  We heard from Manelik in Texas who writes, Of course the government covered up 9-11, just as the past history of what they have concealed.
[02:46:57.180 --> 02:46:59.401]  Keep voting at cnn.com slash showbiz tonight.
[02:46:59.681 --> 02:47:02.162]  If you have some thoughts you want to share with us, join in the thousands.

[02:47:10.829 --> 02:47:12.150]  Charlie Sheen speaks out.
[02:47:12.571 --> 02:47:15.694]  Do you agree with his assertion that there is a government cover-up of 9-11?
[02:47:15.714 --> 02:47:18.217]  Let's take a look at how the vote is going so far.
[02:47:18.237 --> 02:47:20.499]  82% of you say yes.
[02:47:21.020 --> 02:47:22.542]  Only 18% of you say no.
[02:47:22.562 --> 02:47:24.223]  Here are some of the emails we've received.
[02:47:24.744 --> 02:47:31.565]  Annette from Texas writes, What our government has hidden about 9-11 is just the tip of the iceberg.
[02:47:32.025 --> 02:47:37.946]  Daniel from Florida says, I am shocked at the accusations that Charlie Sheen made towards our government.
[02:47:38.407 --> 02:47:43.467]  And Robert from Virginia, The evidence is like lipstick on the collar of a wayward husband.
[02:47:43.808 --> 02:47:46.068]  Democracy requires facing the truth.
[02:47:46.508 --> 02:47:47.428]  You can't keep voting.
[02:47:47.488 --> 02:47:49.169]  CNN.com slash Showbiz Tonight.

[02:52:18.547 --> 02:52:29.712]  Andrew Card resigned a couple days ago, resigned yesterday to be precise, and now there's talk about could he be indicted by Fitzgerald, the attorney there, the U.S.
[02:52:29.752 --> 02:52:30.112]  attorney.
[02:52:30.913 --> 02:52:35.515]  And there's been a lot of other big developments as we see this start to unfold.
[02:52:35.555 --> 02:52:39.857]  Kevin, your take on the Chief of Staff, Andy Card, stepping down.
[02:52:41.238 --> 02:52:44.721]  Oh, gosh, I'd hate to speculate at this point, but he's been there for a while.
[02:52:44.741 --> 02:52:52.426]  He's in deep, but, you know, I get a sense that it's rats getting off the sinking ship and pointing fingers as quick as they can to save their own rear ends.
[02:52:53.067 --> 02:52:53.587]  Yeah.
[02:52:54.188 --> 02:52:59.872]  Ari Fleischer resigned the day after Novak got the names from Rowe from the Valerie Plam affair.
[02:52:59.932 --> 02:53:01.433]  This looks pretty bad.
[02:53:02.754 --> 02:53:08.658]  Well, we always say it's a house of cards and it doesn't take much there to get it all to implode upon itself.
[02:53:08.678 --> 02:53:14.282]  I wanted to say that one of our brothers in the fight for freedom happens to be Hispanic.
[02:53:14.961 --> 02:53:19.222]  He's dug up that Texas DPS flyer and he's going to bring it to us.
[02:53:19.722 --> 02:53:24.124]  I just want to say, while I can... I've got a flyer about how... Everyone's a terrorist.
[02:53:24.884 --> 02:53:27.945]  Well, I want to say, you know, fear is their tool that they use.
[02:53:28.545 --> 02:53:33.067]  They also like to make us feel like we're alone and we're the only ones that believe what we're seeing.
[02:53:33.547 --> 02:53:35.327]  And, well, folks, look at the polls.
[02:53:35.447 --> 02:53:36.628]  What are the polls telling you?
[02:53:36.948 --> 02:53:37.808]  You're not alone.
[02:53:37.868 --> 02:53:39.849]  And if they've got a million people in L.A.
[02:53:39.969 --> 02:53:40.829]  marching up and down,
[02:53:41.539 --> 02:53:42.159]  That's nothing.
[02:53:42.239 --> 02:53:42.859]  That's nothing.
[02:53:42.879 --> 02:53:46.740]  Yeah, that's up to U.S.-owned fake Spanish media to tell them to do that for too much.
[02:53:47.301 --> 02:53:48.261]  We are the majority.
[02:53:48.281 --> 02:53:49.821]  We've been a silent majority.
[02:53:49.881 --> 02:53:51.462]  But, folks, the water's fine.
[02:53:51.502 --> 02:53:52.002]  It's time.
[02:53:52.382 --> 02:53:57.903]  The toes have tested the temperature, and it's time to jump in and get involved in this.
[02:53:57.943 --> 02:54:03.725]  And we're not saying physical fight, but just stand up with your chest out and your chin out and say, we know what's going on.
[02:54:03.745 --> 02:54:04.705]  We're not putting up with this.
[02:54:04.745 --> 02:54:10.887]  And, Alex, I have to say, when you had Webster or Tarpley on on Friday, I think a very important thing that you guys spoke about
[02:54:11.471 --> 02:54:13.012]  We're these leftist gatekeepers.
[02:54:13.232 --> 02:54:15.153]  We need to expose these people.
[02:54:15.213 --> 02:54:16.774]  And, you know, we know Greg Palast.
[02:54:16.814 --> 02:54:17.754]  We know some of these people.
[02:54:18.235 --> 02:54:19.875]  It's time to tell the whole story.
[02:54:19.995 --> 02:54:20.956]  What are you doing?
[02:54:21.036 --> 02:54:22.817]  If you're not going to tell the whole story, then admit it.
[02:54:23.137 --> 02:54:24.578]  You hate this country, don't you?
[02:54:24.618 --> 02:54:26.599]  I mean, where is Noam Chomsky on this?
[02:54:26.779 --> 02:54:28.040]  What are these Amy Goodmans?
[02:54:28.100 --> 02:54:31.061]  I mean, you know, the tabloid rags in the supermarket right now.
[02:54:31.081 --> 02:54:34.603]  When you walk by them, it doesn't say Charlie Sheen believes in UFOs.
[02:54:34.643 --> 02:54:35.223]  He's crazy.
[02:54:35.503 --> 02:54:36.504]  It's the same old stuff.
[02:54:36.944 --> 02:54:38.045]  They didn't even touch this.
[02:54:38.085 --> 02:54:40.466]  You know, the tabloids didn't even pick this stuff up.
[02:54:41.227 --> 02:54:42.248]  The dam has broken.
[02:54:42.268 --> 02:54:43.369]  The news is out.
[02:54:43.749 --> 02:54:45.270]  Suppress it all you want.
[02:54:45.470 --> 02:54:47.552]  You're going to make yourself look foolish.
[02:54:47.792 --> 02:54:48.493]  We're going to win.
[02:54:49.513 --> 02:54:49.774]  All right.
[02:54:49.814 --> 02:54:50.554]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:54:51.355 --> 02:54:55.498]  Now, we'll be back tonight at 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:54:55.558 --> 02:54:57.940]  If you missed any of the broadcast today, it was really important.
[02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:02.023]  In the old first hour, I talked about the illegal aliens saying this is their country and they're taking over.
[02:55:02.103 --> 02:55:04.985]  Again, we're all in this together.
[02:55:05.828 --> 02:55:08.489]  And it's time for people to realize that we are all in this together.
[02:55:08.849 --> 02:55:13.271]  We're in this against the elite that is not free market, that is criminal, that is coming down on us.
[02:55:13.771 --> 02:55:15.572]  So please, as listeners, what can you do?
[02:55:15.632 --> 02:55:17.052]  Tell everybody about this broadcast.
[02:55:17.132 --> 02:55:20.634]  Even if it's on AM or FM in your area, tell them about Infowars.com.
[02:55:20.654 --> 02:55:21.914]  Tell them about PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:55:22.454 --> 02:55:26.516]  Or if you've got a local affiliate, those wonderful jewels out there, tell people every day.
[02:55:27.216 --> 02:55:30.237]  At the parking lot, the grocery store, church, hey, tune in to this local station.
[02:55:30.257 --> 02:55:31.118]  Tune in to this AM.
[02:55:31.518 --> 02:55:32.778]  Tune in to that AM or FM.
[02:55:35.592 --> 02:55:36.755]  Go to Infowars.com.
[02:55:36.795 --> 02:55:42.326]  Get the Virginia training manual for the state employees saying if you protest having your land taken, you're a terrorist.
[02:55:43.587 --> 02:55:44.787]  What's the exact term they use?
[02:55:44.827 --> 02:55:45.948]  Property rights activists.
[02:55:45.968 --> 02:55:47.268]  Those who try to influence the government.
[02:55:47.729 --> 02:55:48.829]  I mean, you're all terrorists.
[02:55:48.849 --> 02:55:50.129]  Well, look, no, they're the terrorists.
[02:55:50.169 --> 02:55:53.171]  The people that do things like this, they are the terrorists.
[02:55:53.611 --> 02:55:55.711]  They're the ones trying to overthrow this republic.
[02:55:56.072 --> 02:55:57.572]  They're the ones that must be stopped.
[02:55:57.592 --> 02:56:01.654]  So whether you're black, white, Hispanic, Asian, polka-dotted, I don't care.
[02:56:01.754 --> 02:56:03.454]  Come together against the New World Order.
[02:56:03.494 --> 02:56:07.896]  Come together for a free market, sovereign nation with a Bill of Rights, a Constitution, a rule of law.
[02:56:08.959 --> 02:56:13.680]  Where you don't have a president, Republican or Democrat, saying he's above the law, saying forgering children is good.
[02:56:13.700 --> 02:56:15.801]  I mean, wake up to what time it is.
[02:56:16.101 --> 02:56:17.241]  Tyranny is upon us.
[02:56:18.242 --> 02:56:19.942]  Good job to the folks at Genesis getting it together.
[02:56:20.663 --> 02:56:21.583]  Coming in for the big win.
[02:56:22.023 --> 02:56:22.843]  God bless you all.
[02:56:22.863 --> 02:56:23.803]  Back tonight, back tomorrow.
