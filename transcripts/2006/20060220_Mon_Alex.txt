[00:00:04.745 --> 00:00:05.405]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.126]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.827 --> 00:00:08.927]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.607 --> 00:00:10.348]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.158 --> 00:00:12.039]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.424]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.904 --> 00:00:20.868]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:20.928 --> 00:00:33.861]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:35.467 --> 00:00:39.588]  To this live Monday edition, it is the 20th day of February 2006.
[00:00:39.668 --> 00:00:42.249]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:45.089]  We're going to be here live for the next three hours.
[00:00:46.410 --> 00:01:00.893]  Joining us in the next hour, we have an individual who has published a book about how wonderful RFID chips are, and he's taken an implantable microchip and so has his girlfriend, and he just thinks that it's the greatest thing since sliced bread.
[00:01:00.993 --> 00:01:04.094]  So we'll be talking to him coming up in the next hour.
[00:01:04.914 --> 00:01:06.575]  In the meantime, we'll cover all the news.
[00:01:06.635 --> 00:01:08.836]  I want to take your phone calls in the shower.
[00:01:09.196 --> 00:01:11.437]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:11.457 --> 00:01:13.578]  That's 1-800-259-9231, and we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:01:13.598 --> 00:01:13.718]  The U.S.
[00:01:14.038 --> 00:01:17.759]  asked Georgia to use bases and airfields for attacks on Iran is now being reported.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.463]  As well as Bin Laden vows never to be captured alive.
[00:01:36.503 --> 00:01:37.463]  But there's a problem.
[00:01:37.984 --> 00:01:39.565]  This report is a month old.
[00:01:39.625 --> 00:01:50.533]  It's the exact same report reissued under the same headline by the Associated Press and used throughout the weekend as a new Bin Laden announcement.
[00:01:50.553 --> 00:01:59.280]  So they just recycled the propaganda knowing that most people won't put two and two together and will just think that it's a whole new tape or a whole new threat.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.061]  And they've done this over and over again.
[00:02:01.101 --> 00:02:01.722]  They have even
[00:02:02.621 --> 00:02:27.533]  released quite a few in the past bin Laden videotapes and then a week later some minor footnotes said oh by the way these were re-edited pieces of four-year-old footage post 9-11 and pre 9-11 so we'll get into that as well update Iran is calling for an end to the cartoon violence over the Prophet Mohammed
[00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:43.921]  And look at the Sydney Morning Herald headline, recent pronouncements from the Bush administration and national security initiatives put in place in the Reagan era could see internment camps and martial law in the United States.
[00:02:44.441 --> 00:02:50.544]  You see, everybody's learning about what's happening here in America overseas, but the average American is still in the dark.
[00:02:50.704 --> 00:02:52.946]  None of this has anything to do with terrorism.
[00:02:52.986 --> 00:02:54.046]  It's all about control.
[00:02:54.066 --> 00:02:57.388]  And here's an example of that out of the Associated Press.
[00:02:58.155 --> 00:03:02.298]  School bus drivers join the Terror Watch nationwide.
[00:03:02.318 --> 00:03:08.242]  Homeland Security getting involved with school bus drivers, teaching them how to look for terrorists and crime.
[00:03:08.262 --> 00:03:14.306]  See, you can't just tell the American people, hey, we're all going to be a nation of snitches now in 1984 to tattle on each other.
[00:03:15.086 --> 00:03:17.128]  No, you just say, oh, it's to fight terror.
[00:03:17.148 --> 00:03:22.631]  And then once you go to the little seminar, oh, and crime, because all crime is terror.
[00:03:22.652 --> 00:03:27.595]  And I want to get into at least part of Congressman Ron Paul's
[00:03:29.358 --> 00:03:34.179]  Well, it's a speech he writes each week, and then it's Ron Paul's comments, his straight talk.
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:41.242]  A lot of times we air the audio here, but instead I think I'll just read part of his statements about the plunging dollar.
[00:03:41.362 --> 00:03:42.302]  Before the U.S.
[00:03:42.342 --> 00:03:46.023]  House of Representatives, the end of dollar hegemony.
[00:03:46.063 --> 00:03:49.044]  That means the end of dollar monopoly.
[00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:57.114]  And that is very serious for all of us because we're all under the yoke of the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve System.
[00:03:57.634 --> 00:04:07.878]  But people are beginning to wake up to this and beginning slowly but surely to come up out of their deep sleep and beginning to realize exactly what's happening in this nation.
[00:04:08.258 --> 00:04:14.360]  Meanwhile, an example of global government, genetically modified food must be allowed into Europe under World Trade Organization rules.
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.021]  Does it matter of the sovereign nations
[00:04:17.461 --> 00:04:24.487]  Don't want this toxic, dangerous garbage that takes over their other crops and infests everything being brought in.
[00:04:24.828 --> 00:04:27.590]  Under global government rules, you've got to do it.
[00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.091]  It's supposedly free trade.
[00:04:29.111 --> 00:04:33.535]  It's like it's free trade to force a country to let all the Chinese slave goods in.
[00:04:33.995 --> 00:04:35.677]  Is it free trade to compete against slaves?
[00:04:36.357 --> 00:04:39.040]  This and a lot more coming up today.
[00:04:40.086 --> 00:04:42.147]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.

[00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:06.871]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:29.975 --> 00:08:39.501]  The Republican and Democratic parties in this country are controlled by the very same corporate interest.
[00:08:40.461 --> 00:08:46.505]  And they only try to fool the population into believing that there is truly a difference.
[00:08:46.565 --> 00:08:59.653]  Now, when you get down to the grassroots level, there is a big difference between Democrats and Republicans, but at the higher levels inside the governmental systems, simply put, we're dealing
[00:09:02.316 --> 00:09:04.258]  With manufactured consent.
[00:09:04.338 --> 00:09:07.200]  We're dealing with a false political paradigm.
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.762]  And I use that term a lot because that's what it is.
[00:09:10.642 --> 00:09:18.288]  When you get down to brass tacks, Hillary Clinton and George Bush are in agreement on about 95% of their policies.
[00:09:18.368 --> 00:09:24.232]  But they have these big public debates and these arguments and these staged events when they're not vacationing and hanging out together.
[00:09:25.473 --> 00:09:26.894]  It's like Mary Madeline.
[00:09:27.014 --> 00:09:28.756]  She is the PR manager
[00:09:29.497 --> 00:09:31.238]  for Vice President Dick Cheney.
[00:09:31.258 --> 00:09:37.040]  Meanwhile, her husband is Carvel, and he was one of the big PR managers for Bill Clinton.
[00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.681]  It's all a club, and it's a big joke on us.
[00:09:41.721 --> 00:09:50.184]  They're literally running a scam on the American people, and so many people are fooled by the theater.
[00:09:57.834 --> 00:10:02.296]  It is the equivalent of WWF wrestling.
[00:10:03.196 --> 00:10:03.937]  It's that simple.
[00:10:04.517 --> 00:10:14.581]  And there are millions of Americans, full-grown adult men and women, who believe that professional wrestling, or WWE, whatever it's called today, is real.
[00:10:14.621 --> 00:10:21.304]  In fact, every time I have gotten on air over years past, and even just a few months ago, last time I mentioned this,
[00:10:22.219 --> 00:10:23.260]  I will get phone calls.
[00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:28.184]  I will get threatening emails saying, how dare you say wrestling isn't real?
[00:10:29.725 --> 00:10:31.787]  And it's the same thing with the general population.
[00:10:31.827 --> 00:10:39.153]  A lot of people say, how dare you say that the Republicans and the Democrats at the committee, chairman and above level are on the same team?
[00:10:39.453 --> 00:10:40.354]  Well, I'm sorry.
[00:10:40.514 --> 00:10:41.675]  That's just the facts.
[00:10:42.156 --> 00:10:50.983]  Before I get into all the news, I've got to tell you, I was up here until late last night working on a new documentary film.
[00:10:52.071 --> 00:10:53.252]  That I'm producing.
[00:10:55.654 --> 00:11:07.905]  And I was voicing a section of it, just a synopsis of government-sponsored terror events that I haven't covered in a lot of detail in my previous films.
[00:11:07.925 --> 00:11:16.233]  I mean, I've talked a lot about how the first World Trade Center attack, the FBI cooked the bomb, trained the driver, that's even been in the New York Times, hidden in plain view.
[00:11:16.917 --> 00:11:22.179]  We've covered Oklahoma City, we've covered 9-11 in just, you know, every minute detail.
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:28.122]  But, we've talked on air, on the radio, but never in the films about Mosaddegh.
[00:11:29.982 --> 00:11:40.066]  And how our government staged terror attacks in Iran to blame it on Mosaddegh, and that he was pro-West, anti-communist, Time Magazine Man of the Year twice.
[00:11:40.146 --> 00:11:40.627]  I didn't know.
[00:11:41.207 --> 00:11:43.588]  I thought it was just once, but I've now learned twice.
[00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:45.369]  That he was Man of the Year?
[00:11:45.389 --> 00:11:46.210]  No, that's not correct.
[00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:49.391]  Man of the Year once, and then on the cover of Time Magazine two other times.
[00:11:50.992 --> 00:12:03.697]  And I was shocked to see that when I was doing some more research on Mosaddegh and what happened in 1953, the elected Iranian president, that the CIA's own website!
[00:12:06.038 --> 00:12:09.519]  I mean, it's on the CIA.gov.
[00:12:09.699 --> 00:12:09.939]  CIA!
[00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:15.472]  They admit that they carried out terror attacks.
[00:12:15.572 --> 00:12:16.553]  They brag about it.
[00:12:16.593 --> 00:12:29.183]  I mean, I knew Kermit Roosevelt before he died, back in 2000, that he'd done radio interviews bragging how he staged terror attacks and how he and a nine-man team brought down the government by blaming it on Mozadek.
[00:12:29.203 --> 00:12:33.227]  But I mean, I was shocked by him bragging about it like he was talking about
[00:12:34.361 --> 00:12:39.145]  How he'd raised a record-sized tomato or pumpkin or something.
[00:12:39.185 --> 00:12:42.748]  I mean, he was bragging about it like it was some good accomplishment.
[00:12:43.328 --> 00:12:46.311]  Blowing up mosques, killing women and children, shooting people.
[00:12:46.331 --> 00:12:51.175]  I mean, he was talking about that like he was talking about trimming his toenails.
[00:12:52.716 --> 00:12:57.099]  Or the price of pork bellies on the Chicago Mercantile.
[00:12:58.661 --> 00:13:00.182]  The cold-bloodedness of it.
[00:13:00.868 --> 00:13:02.769]  The serial killer nature of it.
[00:13:03.029 --> 00:13:17.135]  But to then be doing research last night, I didn't know that there's whole sections of the CIA fact book, and CIA history sections, and CIA archives, and CIA book reviews.
[00:13:17.295 --> 00:13:18.596]  They're quite proud of it.
[00:13:20.337 --> 00:13:29.601]  In fact, I don't have a Google search in front of me, it was in the other office next to me, but I think it was something like, no, it was CIA, Mozadek, bombing.
[00:13:31.218 --> 00:13:40.381]  And if you type that in, one of the links on the first page will be to the CIA, and then from there you can do more detailed searches at CIA.gov.
[00:13:41.181 --> 00:13:44.062]  That's right, Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:13:44.102 --> 00:13:47.623]  See, here's an example of what I'm talking about.
[00:13:47.683 --> 00:13:50.644]  They count on you not being informed, not being aware,
[00:13:52.026 --> 00:13:52.966]  of what's going on.
[00:13:53.126 --> 00:13:56.967]  Here's Paul Watson's headline on this today at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:13:57.327 --> 00:14:02.028]  AP recycles old Bin Laden tape for new propaganda.
[00:14:02.809 --> 00:14:11.031]  Using the justification that it was complete, the Associated Press reported on a month-old alleged Bin Laden audio tape as if it was a new story.
[00:14:11.131 --> 00:14:20.233]  Either it was a quiet weekend, or this is another branch of Rumsfeld's black propaganda campaign, or what they call the black world.
[00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:30.595]  It's a shame that the major disinfo news organs don't have as much zeal to update other fairly important news items.
[00:14:31.495 --> 00:14:41.261]  Did the fact that several of the alleged 9-1-1 hijackers turned up alive weeks after the attack, which is admitted, provoke a rash of top-of-the-bill headlines?
[00:14:41.481 --> 00:14:41.861]  No.
[00:14:43.302 --> 00:14:48.705]  It was picked up by a couple of outlets and it certainly wasn't given any major play.
[00:14:50.103 --> 00:14:56.145]  Some Islamic websites reposted the old Bin Laden tape in the AP, thought this deserved major coverage.
[00:14:56.625 --> 00:14:59.326]  As did Drudge, who put it at the top of his page.
[00:14:59.847 --> 00:15:07.409]  If the same website had reposted old articles from 9-1-1, would we be reading Twin Towers attack headlines today?
[00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:08.710]  No, we would not.
[00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:13.312]  Should it concern us that such websites have very strong U.S.
[00:15:13.433 --> 00:15:16.054]  government connections as Pentagon front groups?
[00:15:16.414 --> 00:15:26.560]  Should we be alarmed that Rumsfeld held a meeting at the Council on Foreign Relations last Friday in which he outlined a plan to use weblogs as a tool for U.S.
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.861]  military propaganda?
[00:15:28.481 --> 00:15:34.685]  Last month, Rumsfeld also made it clear that enemy websites would be attacked if they harmed the agenda of the U.S.
[00:15:34.725 --> 00:15:35.105]  government.
[00:15:35.145 --> 00:15:38.347]  That means foreign corporations subdividing the country right now.
[00:15:39.975 --> 00:15:50.823]  Reporting that Bin Laden tape, again, as if it's new, even aside from the proven past fraudulent tapes, simply recycles and re-amplifies old propaganda like a Band-Aid.
[00:15:51.344 --> 00:15:56.848]  Keep the She-Bolt fighting and frightened, reinforce the myth that Bin Laden is still alive, even
[00:15:58.021 --> 00:16:07.364]  Alive and lessen the dissent when the Patriot Act is renewed and when the White House says it will fight to the nail to block any NSA spying investigation.
[00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:16.226]  Just like a terror alert that is denounced as garbage by 23 Intel experts, the tactics never change.
[00:16:16.646 --> 00:16:18.107]  Reposting a month old
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:30.182]  Hokey Bin Laden tape can hardly be called creative, but it's the latest lame attempt to lull Americans into a continued state of ambivalence and trance-like subservience.
[00:16:30.902 --> 00:16:37.144]  Now, here's the actual Associated Press article reporting it as if it's a new Bin Laden tape.
[00:16:37.704 --> 00:16:45.545]  Bin Laden vows never to be captured again, and this came out on the 19th.
[00:16:45.625 --> 00:16:47.746]  They released this yesterday.
[00:16:48.547 --> 00:16:51.569]  Osama Bin Laden vowed never to be captured alive and said the U.S.
[00:16:51.610 --> 00:17:01.077]  military became a barbaric and Saddam Hussein in an audio tape reposted on a militant Islamic website and being broadcast last month.
[00:17:02.176 --> 00:17:08.221]  And it says, in the tape posted to the website Monday, Bin Laden offered the United States a long-term truce.
[00:17:08.822 --> 00:17:09.522]  And it goes on.
[00:17:09.762 --> 00:17:18.590]  So the same truce story, the same, uh, you'll-never-catch-me-alive story, I'll-never-quit story, is out again as if it didn't seek in.
[00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:24.935]  They don't even produce some new fake Bin Laden tape, and previous ones have been proven to be fake, both video and audio.
[00:17:25.175 --> 00:17:25.716]  They don't care.
[00:17:25.776 --> 00:17:30.300]  Now they just reissue the same headline again, and it's taken as if it's
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:36.802]  Mothers milk news and information by TV and by websites and by the Associated Press.
[00:17:38.743 --> 00:17:45.665]  And again, they know that the average person isn't keeping track of this, isn't paying attention, and isn't really aware of even what's going on.
[00:17:47.426 --> 00:17:49.466]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[00:17:50.607 --> 00:17:53.748]  And until people start becoming as informed about
[00:17:55.558 --> 00:18:20.887]  the geopolitical structure and state-sponsored terror as they are about baseball or about football or basketball uh... or the michael jordan invitational in golf we're going to become more and more enslaved we're going to lose more more of our freedoms you know for so many americans they think torture is great they think fema camps are great as long as it's quote for america don't don't you understand
[00:18:21.622 --> 00:18:24.963]  The people running this country right now are subdividing us.
[00:18:25.003 --> 00:18:25.863]  They're looting us.
[00:18:26.163 --> 00:18:28.264]  They're selling off our infrastructure.
[00:18:28.524 --> 00:18:34.385]  We're being de-industrialized by every economic yardstick and measurement in existence.
[00:18:34.926 --> 00:18:36.426]  All of the indices show that.
[00:18:37.126 --> 00:18:42.888]  Meanwhile, the fancy PR with the info babes tell you how great everything is.
[00:18:43.168 --> 00:18:44.348]  And that's not the case.
[00:18:45.043 --> 00:18:49.009]  The globalists own policy reports say they're going to de-industrialize us.
[00:18:49.349 --> 00:18:56.779]  They say they're going to turn us into a third world country, to get us in line, to be basically a military province that supplies troops for the global empire.
[00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:00.585]  And that's now happening, and meanwhile,
[00:19:02.217 --> 00:19:08.399]  The general population thinks the Democrats are going to save them, or they think that George Bush is going to save them.
[00:19:08.419 --> 00:19:10.219]  And I'm sorry, it's smoke and mirrors.
[00:19:10.699 --> 00:19:11.859]  And I love this country.
[00:19:12.379 --> 00:19:20.021]  The good news is, more and more people are becoming awake, they are beginning to realize what's happening, and they are taking off the blinders.
[00:19:20.421 --> 00:19:26.803]  And to those that are sticking their head in the ice water and shaking it off and waking up, I commend you.
[00:19:27.343 --> 00:19:29.163]  Now it's time to wake up other people.
[00:19:29.223 --> 00:19:31.304]  Now, I'm going to come back and take calls.
[00:19:32.142 --> 00:19:33.183]  Do things a little bit different today.
[00:19:33.283 --> 00:19:38.546]  And then we'll get into USS Georgia to use bases and airfields for attacks on Iran.
[00:19:39.127 --> 00:19:41.228]  Another headline here, detention camp jitters.
[00:19:41.868 --> 00:19:43.970]  School bus drivers to join the terror watch.
[00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:49.233]  Ron Paul talks about the end of dollar hegemony or the dollar being the world reserve currency.
[00:19:50.054 --> 00:19:50.874]  And a lot more.
[00:19:51.354 --> 00:19:52.275]  So stay with us.
[00:19:52.335 --> 00:19:58.139]  Big broadcast lined up today and we got a guy coming on in the second hour who took a microchip and loves it.
[00:20:00.715 --> 00:20:07.059]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:20:07.279 --> 00:20:12.302]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:20:12.623 --> 00:20:20.507]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:20:20.688 --> 00:20:27.732]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:20:27.932 --> 00:20:29.153]  There are no side effects.
[00:20:29.294 --> 00:20:32.697]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:20:32.737 --> 00:20:33.859]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:20:34.159 --> 00:20:35.420]  Eliminate the cause.
[00:20:35.641 --> 00:20:42.468]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:20:42.588 --> 00:20:45.031]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[00:20:48.152 --> 00:20:48.192]  866-885-6625.
[00:20:48.212 --> 00:20:49.232]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:20:49.272 --> 00:20:50.533]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[00:20:50.553 --> 00:20:51.173]  One and the same.
[00:20:51.193 --> 00:20:52.633]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%,
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:19.343]  In a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:21:19.763 --> 00:21:22.885]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:21:23.145 --> 00:21:24.986]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:21:25.046 --> 00:21:28.068]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:21:28.608 --> 00:21:30.829]  Here is reality.
[00:21:31.189 --> 00:21:34.791]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:21:35.272 --> 00:21:38.934]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:21:39.494 --> 00:21:42.315]  Gold, in the same time frame, increased 35% in value.
[00:21:43.658 --> 00:21:47.383]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.
[00:21:47.723 --> 00:21:49.225]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.

[00:22:10.982 --> 00:22:17.145]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:22:17.545 --> 00:22:25.449]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:22:25.869 --> 00:22:31.214]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:22:31.374 --> 00:22:35.137]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[00:23:55.385 --> 00:24:03.852]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:24:03.872 --> 00:24:07.715]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.781]  All right, folks, we're back live.
[00:24:33.801 --> 00:24:41.827]  We're going to go ahead and go to some of your phone calls, and then I'm going to get back into the other news.
[00:24:41.927 --> 00:24:43.549]  Dan in Arkansas, you're on the air.
[00:24:43.589 --> 00:24:43.929]  Welcome.
[00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:45.450]  Hello, Alex.
[00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:45.831]  How are you?
[00:24:46.584 --> 00:24:53.307]  I opened my morning paper today, and on page 4A I noticed an article I thought would be of interest to you.
[00:24:54.088 --> 00:24:58.270]  It talks about Mock Fallujah to offer training for soldiers.
[00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:02.872]  Downtown Fallujah is coming to Arkansas, minus the Iraq War.
[00:25:03.552 --> 00:25:13.737]  And it goes on and on about how they're setting up a training center here in Arkansas, similar to some of the items we've seen on the videos.
[00:25:14.597 --> 00:25:15.638]  And they got to thinking,
[00:25:16.621 --> 00:25:20.285]  How come they don't use some of these abandoned bases for this training?
[00:25:21.506 --> 00:25:24.088]  And why are they, you know, setting it up in the cities?
[00:25:24.849 --> 00:25:36.841]  Well, I was also going to mention that it's funded by an olive group, a British firm that supplies personnel and combat training for armies and corporations.
[00:25:37.762 --> 00:25:39.424]  Well, have you seen my documentary?
[00:25:40.603 --> 00:25:42.504]  Police State 2000, you would understand.
[00:25:42.564 --> 00:25:45.065]  The Marines admit this is for America.
[00:25:45.545 --> 00:25:52.027]  They have hundreds of shutdown bases, or bases they have in mothballs, and whole cities that they could use, whole towns.
[00:25:53.068 --> 00:25:54.908]  This, sir, is about conditioning.
[00:25:54.948 --> 00:26:01.471]  This is nothing but a massive, ongoing conditioning program to train the public to accept troops on the streets.
[00:26:01.531 --> 00:26:07.533]  And now the White House has said they want to get rid of Posse Comitatus and use the military to fight terrorist and crime.
[00:26:07.913 --> 00:26:13.177]  So it's just like Red Dawn, you know, in a Hollywood movie, when you're under Soviet occupation, there's troops on the streets.
[00:26:13.598 --> 00:26:17.901]  Or in Cuba, or Russia, or China, or in Nazi Germany, or America.
[00:26:17.941 --> 00:26:19.422]  So this is your new freedom.
[00:26:19.903 --> 00:26:23.285]  The police chief of San Antonio calling for cameras in people's houses.
[00:26:24.266 --> 00:26:25.267]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[00:26:25.407 --> 00:26:32.693]  I was in this morning's paper, and the first thing I thought is, if I could, I was going to try to just touch base with you on that.
[00:26:32.773 --> 00:26:34.815]  So thanks for your time, Alex.
[00:26:36.249 --> 00:26:36.849]  Thank you, sir.
[00:26:36.869 --> 00:26:37.810]  I appreciate the call.
[00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:39.911]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[00:26:39.931 --> 00:26:41.933]  Let's talk to Ernest in Pennsylvania.
[00:26:41.973 --> 00:26:42.373]  Go ahead.
[00:26:44.834 --> 00:26:46.095]  Okay, Emmett in Pennsylvania.
[00:26:46.115 --> 00:26:46.496]  Go ahead.
[00:26:46.636 --> 00:26:48.056]  Yes.
[00:26:48.237 --> 00:26:50.318]  Alex, hold on to your whatever.
[00:26:51.038 --> 00:26:52.119]  Just grab something.
[00:26:52.179 --> 00:26:52.739]  Hold on.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.182]  I get the Philadelphia All News station.
[00:26:57.663 --> 00:27:02.926]  They're announcing this morning that Bush has made contract with an Arab company
[00:27:03.652 --> 00:27:07.033]  To manage the Philadelphia port and four others.
[00:27:07.673 --> 00:27:08.393]  Five ports.
[00:27:09.194 --> 00:27:10.794]  It's actually six.
[00:27:10.814 --> 00:27:14.435]  We've been reporting on that now for a week and a half.
[00:27:14.475 --> 00:27:18.256]  In the first three days, everyone denied that it was even a real report when I covered it.
[00:27:18.536 --> 00:27:20.677]  It's in the news on the radio this morning.
[00:27:21.477 --> 00:27:26.198]  You know, I get frustrated at my Democrat and Republican friends.
[00:27:26.298 --> 00:27:28.679]  I can't convince them that it's all the same.
[00:27:31.507 --> 00:27:32.127]  Well, it is.
[00:27:32.147 --> 00:27:33.208]  I mean, that's what's happening.
[00:27:33.328 --> 00:27:34.728]  Yeah, it is all the same.
[00:27:35.428 --> 00:27:38.629]  But your film, Martial Law, is excellent.
[00:27:40.269 --> 00:27:40.850]  Well, thank you.
[00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:41.750]  I appreciate that.
[00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:43.330]  Yeah, no doubt about it.
[00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:44.251]  He knew.
[00:27:44.271 --> 00:27:45.531]  He knew ahead of time.
[00:27:46.391 --> 00:27:47.091]  No doubt about it.
[00:27:47.111 --> 00:27:51.873]  It's very disturbing and annoying and, you know, yeah, he knew.
[00:27:51.893 --> 00:27:53.033]  Well, thank you.
[00:27:53.979 --> 00:27:54.539]  Well, thank you.
[00:27:54.579 --> 00:27:55.640]  I appreciate the call.
[00:27:56.781 --> 00:28:06.107]  But again, sir, almost all the roads in the country, the water districts, everything is being handed over to foreign companies.
[00:28:06.147 --> 00:28:07.428]  This is the New World Order.
[00:28:07.468 --> 00:28:14.113]  It's international corporations looting our once free society, militarizing the police against us.
[00:28:16.294 --> 00:28:18.295]  Let's talk to... Who's up next?
[00:28:19.716 --> 00:28:21.718]  Carlos in California, you're on the air.
[00:28:21.778 --> 00:28:22.118]  Welcome.
[00:28:22.774 --> 00:28:25.636]  Hey Alex, great to be talking to you.
[00:28:26.256 --> 00:28:36.882]  I was reading on a website the other day that the strategy for the Mohammed cartoons was devised in a meeting in 2005 in Bavaria, I believe.
[00:28:37.443 --> 00:28:44.507]  And present were some of the New World Order luminaries such as Michael Lutein and Henry Kissinger among others.
[00:28:45.608 --> 00:28:51.031]  And that the publication company that owns the newspaper has ties with the Bilderbergers.
[00:28:52.338 --> 00:29:10.472]  So, there you go, if you were all over there using these cartoons as an act to provoke and incite the masses, the Islamic masses, who obviously are very tired of being used upon, you know, and being targeted.
[00:29:11.332 --> 00:29:17.337]  Well, I mean, it's the exact same thing again with so many things that we see.
[00:29:17.517 --> 00:29:18.698]  We have the documents.
[00:29:18.718 --> 00:29:19.899]  There's a Pentagon office
[00:29:20.908 --> 00:29:22.109]  Call P-2-O-G.
[00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:25.512]  And it openly is there to stir up the Arabs.
[00:29:26.292 --> 00:29:31.416]  And right on the eve of the Iran attack, notice that suddenly all these riots start, all these problems start.
[00:29:31.736 --> 00:29:33.477]  They release more Abu Ghraib photos.
[00:29:33.517 --> 00:29:33.938]  Stay there.
[00:29:34.578 --> 00:29:35.759]  Carlos, I'm going to let you finish up.
[00:29:35.779 --> 00:29:37.280]  Don't want to cut you short on the other side.
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.121]  Wide open phones.
[00:29:38.141 --> 00:29:38.501]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:38.681 --> 00:29:39.061]  Stay with us.
[00:29:39.122 --> 00:29:40.022]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:50.598 --> 00:29:53.605]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.527 --> 00:29:57.213]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.678 --> 00:30:04.241]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:30:04.401 --> 00:30:06.563]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:30:06.844 --> 00:30:16.955]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[00:30:17.255 --> 00:30:19.597]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.

[00:31:00.197 --> 00:31:03.219]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:31:03.519 --> 00:31:08.442]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:08.703 --> 00:31:13.065]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:13.366 --> 00:31:22.271]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.

[00:31:26.374 --> 00:31:31.401]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:31.701 --> 00:31:38.430]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:31:38.931 --> 00:31:39.471]  What about you?
[00:31:40.203 --> 00:31:45.567]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:32:48.519 --> 00:32:48.699]  That's 312-224-2710.
[00:33:06.905 --> 00:33:10.287]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest.
[00:33:10.507 --> 00:33:13.149]  A gun on my hip and the right to arrest.
[00:33:13.169 --> 00:33:16.531]  I'm the guy who's the boss on this highway.
[00:33:16.751 --> 00:33:19.533]  So watch out what you're doing when you're driving my way.
[00:33:19.833 --> 00:33:22.514]  If you break the law, you'll hear from me I know.
[00:33:22.895 --> 00:33:25.676]  I'm working for the state, I'm the highway patrol.
[00:33:28.918 --> 00:33:35.102]  Well, you'll know me when you see me, cause my door's painted white, with my sirene a-screamin' and my flashin' red light.
[00:33:35.282 --> 00:33:41.325]  I work all day and I work all night, just to keep a long order, tryin' to do what's right.
[00:33:41.746 --> 00:33:47.649]  If I write you out a ticket, then you better drive slow, I'm just a-doin' my job, I'm the Highway Patrol.
[00:33:47.809 --> 00:33:48.189]  Alright!
[00:33:52.024 --> 00:33:52.785]  We're back live.
[00:33:52.845 --> 00:33:56.167]  Let's go ahead and go back to Carlos in California.
[00:33:56.207 --> 00:33:57.128]  Carlos, go ahead.
[00:33:57.928 --> 00:34:01.911]  Yes, well, you know, the New World Order, of course, is encircling us.
[00:34:02.071 --> 00:34:06.013]  They're putting the wagons around us by using so many different strategies.
[00:34:06.073 --> 00:34:12.738]  And the latest one is the port authorities being turned over to the Islamic groups.
[00:34:12.798 --> 00:34:17.721]  And essentially what they're doing is the Chinese already control the Panama Canal.
[00:34:18.441 --> 00:34:21.003]  The Latin countries are colluding to form blocs.
[00:34:21.681 --> 00:34:25.932]  Leftist block and they will join forces with Iran the moment we attack them.
[00:34:26.434 --> 00:34:28.319]  And now they're giving away our ports here.
[00:34:28.339 --> 00:34:29.863]  See, we're being encircled!
[00:34:31.303 --> 00:34:52.928]  And of course, eventually all the riots that we saw in Europe and all across the world because of these Mohammed Gardens are going to occur here too, because the New World Order, through relaxation of immigration standards, has allowed all these multiple cultures across the world a prodigious migration of all these people, and we're all mixed together.
[00:34:52.968 --> 00:34:57.829]  There's nothing wrong with mixing together, but when it becomes so prodigious,
[00:34:58.456 --> 00:35:00.304]  And so rampant, it's harmful!
[00:35:00.645 --> 00:35:03.838]  And we're going to be faced with riots right here in the United States also.
[00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:05.791]  Well, you're right, Carlos.
[00:35:05.831 --> 00:35:08.112]  It's all been done by design, and that's the scary thing.
[00:35:08.152 --> 00:35:09.593]  They brag how they've done it.
[00:35:09.633 --> 00:35:16.318]  It's like the last caller before you brought up how the Marines are going to be doing urban warfare drills in his city, and I've seen it.
[00:35:16.338 --> 00:35:20.241]  It's going to be in Little Rock and other areas, and they take over.
[00:35:20.261 --> 00:35:21.362]  They point guns at you.
[00:35:21.382 --> 00:35:22.883]  They tell you don't come outside your house.
[00:35:22.923 --> 00:35:25.484]  They come over and take video cameras away from you.
[00:35:25.524 --> 00:35:27.946]  I've got Marines saying it's for America.
[00:35:28.266 --> 00:35:30.388]  We're training to take your guns and now see
[00:35:30.928 --> 00:35:37.194]  If you're a pro-Marine, if you're a good American that everybody can trust, then you better be for it.
[00:35:37.654 --> 00:35:39.095]  Well, I'm pro-Marine Corps.
[00:35:39.135 --> 00:35:41.317]  I guess I am for gun confiscation.
[00:35:41.337 --> 00:35:43.859]  I mean, that's the weird sicko... No, no, no.
[00:35:44.099 --> 00:35:50.945]  We're against the Marines with their proud history being turned into this horrible instrument of control.
[00:35:51.246 --> 00:35:58.332]  But again, for the shallow-minded people out there who can't even tell that a month-old bin Laden story is a month old,
[00:35:59.273 --> 00:36:00.714]  And even that report was false.
[00:36:01.054 --> 00:36:04.398]  They just recycle it and people don't even realize the difference.
[00:36:05.339 --> 00:36:06.660]  Well, because you're very right.
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:09.123]  People have a very short attention span.
[00:36:09.744 --> 00:36:15.369]  And people are so bogged down with work, trying to make a living paying all these tremendous
[00:36:16.526 --> 00:36:28.156]  Uh, access to the federal government, and that's by design, by the New World Order, to keep us so preoccupied that we don't have time to look at what's going on around the world.
[00:36:28.516 --> 00:36:29.637]  We're a sleeping giant.
[00:36:30.338 --> 00:36:32.600]  And this is the calm before the storm.
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:37.324]  The moment we hit Iran, all ages are going to break loose around us.
[00:36:38.024 --> 00:36:38.965]  And it's going to be too late.
[00:36:38.985 --> 00:36:40.827]  That's when people will finally start waking up.
[00:36:40.867 --> 00:36:42.368]  There's something drastically wrong here.
[00:36:42.933 --> 00:36:45.934]  Well, everything's converging at once, Carlos.
[00:36:46.555 --> 00:36:58.220]  The dollar is plunging, the country is being repossessed, the infrastructure is being sold off, and the Bill of Rights is being dismantled.
[00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:03.522]  And meanwhile, Europe really owns and controls the United States.
[00:37:03.562 --> 00:37:05.603]  That is the financial interest based in Europe.
[00:37:05.903 --> 00:37:09.225]  And America has been playing the part of their bully, their enforcer,
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:19.326]  And yes, whether it's this year, next year, or five years from now, we're already being hung out to dry politically as the boogeyman, and we don't even know it.
[00:37:19.546 --> 00:37:25.090]  Because the same globalists that own America put out propaganda saying we're the ultimate evil overseas.
[00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:26.411]  The very same papers.
[00:37:26.451 --> 00:37:30.434]  Rupert Murdoch has papers in Europe against the war saying we're bad.
[00:37:30.914 --> 00:37:34.497]  Then he has papers over here saying it's all good, it's only wonderful.
[00:37:34.837 --> 00:37:39.621]  Playing both sides, using us to do their dirty work, and then hanging us out to dry.
[00:37:39.902 --> 00:37:41.463]  That's why the globalists are masters.
[00:37:41.503 --> 00:37:44.045]  They play different sides off against each other.
[00:37:45.226 --> 00:37:46.547]  Boy, you're absolutely right.
[00:37:46.587 --> 00:37:48.108]  You just mentioned Rupert Murdoch.
[00:37:48.889 --> 00:37:58.657]  He is an agent for the Rothschild banking family, and that's one of the premier families leading, on top of the pyramid, that's leading this quest for a new world order.
[00:38:00.038 --> 00:38:04.282]  That's the heart of the problem right there, but people have no clue whatsoever.
[00:38:05.154 --> 00:38:07.616]  And I don't know, this is the calm before the storm.
[00:38:07.656 --> 00:38:09.857]  I've never been so worried in my life as this year.
[00:38:10.197 --> 00:38:11.438]  Well, Carlos, you're right.
[00:38:11.818 --> 00:38:21.144]  And you're right to say earlier, we've all got to get above all the petty infighting issues they try to lay out like a buffet of lies before us.
[00:38:21.544 --> 00:38:33.412]  We've got to start playing chess in a three-dimensional level and see how they're manipulating things and get past what group we think we're with and see the big picture of how they're playing us off.
[00:38:34.437 --> 00:38:40.740]  Well, you know, another example, and I don't mean to monopolize the conversation, but another example is the Cheney incident.
[00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:43.802]  I'm beginning to believe they're using that as a decoy.
[00:38:44.222 --> 00:38:46.703]  Something else much graver is going down.
[00:38:47.224 --> 00:38:59.690]  Just like Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky, that was a decoy to distract attention from other graver things that were going on, such as the giveaway of our technology to the Chinese, among other things.
[00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:03.552]  I'm beginning to believe the Cheney incident is covering up something else.
[00:39:04.594 --> 00:39:05.615]  Well, that's the problem.
[00:39:05.655 --> 00:39:15.261]  When they're so dishonest, when they lie more often than they tell the truth, when they engage in all of this subterfuge, you don't know what to believe at that point.
[00:39:15.621 --> 00:39:19.543]  And all of us seem to be very, very wary right now.
[00:39:19.563 --> 00:39:22.585]  But all confidence has been lost in these people.
[00:39:22.625 --> 00:39:23.546]  I appreciate your call.
[00:39:24.463 --> 00:39:24.683]  Yeah, Alex.
[00:39:52.992 --> 00:39:53.332]  Yes.
[00:39:53.572 --> 00:39:54.053]  Can you hear me?
[00:39:54.513 --> 00:39:55.053]  I sure can.
[00:39:55.074 --> 00:39:55.794]  Can you hear me?
[00:39:55.894 --> 00:39:56.354]  Yes, sir.
[00:39:57.135 --> 00:40:01.818]  I've got a book here that will prove that Dick Cheney is lying through his teeth about this shooting incident.
[00:40:02.298 --> 00:40:09.283]  As you well know, there are two longtime law enforcement officers, Evan Marshall and Ed Stanao, who've written books about ballistics.
[00:40:09.744 --> 00:40:12.345]  And the second book they published is called Street Stoppers.
[00:40:12.966 --> 00:40:13.546]  And on page 310,
[00:40:14.966 --> 00:40:34.099]  They actually fired a 12-gauge field load into a block of that ballistic gelatin, that ordnance gel that they use to test ammunition with, and they fired it from just about 2 to 3 feet away, and the caption reads, The 12-gauge number 7.5 birdshot penetrates 3 to 6 inches of gelatin.
[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:37.702]  This load is easily defeated by heavy clothes.
[00:40:38.422 --> 00:40:41.224]  Now, on page 317 in the same book, Street Stoppers,
[00:40:43.991 --> 00:40:49.474]  You find out that 7.5 shot, the diameter is .095 inches.
[00:40:49.674 --> 00:40:50.974]  It's under a tenth of an inch.
[00:40:51.535 --> 00:40:55.757]  And the weight of those pellets is a minuscule 1.3 grains.
[00:40:55.917 --> 00:40:59.318]  It'll take over 336 pellets to equal one out.
[00:41:00.239 --> 00:41:11.024]  Now, if these pellets only penetrate 3 to 6 inches in ordnance gel, fired from 2 feet away, then I guarantee you at 30 yards or 90 feet away,
[00:41:13.604 --> 00:41:22.371]  Those pellets would barely penetrate the skin, much less bury themselves in the thoracic cavity of Mr. Woodington and reach his heart.
[00:41:22.751 --> 00:41:24.713]  Sir, I'm just curious.
[00:41:25.013 --> 00:41:26.314]  Did you hear the show last week?
[00:41:26.634 --> 00:41:27.234]  Yes, I did.
[00:41:27.815 --> 00:41:29.656]  Because I've got neocons.
[00:41:29.676 --> 00:41:31.898]  Again, there's all these conservatives, all these hunters.
[00:41:32.038 --> 00:41:33.019]  They don't care if I'm right.
[00:41:33.039 --> 00:41:33.940]  They don't care if you're right.
[00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:35.661]  They just go on websites.
[00:41:35.701 --> 00:41:37.122]  They just send us emails.
[00:41:37.142 --> 00:41:39.384]  They go and write news articles saying it's all made up.
[00:41:39.964 --> 00:41:57.692]  And then at 90 feet, that everybody knows that 7.5 birdshot goes in 4 inches, when the ballistics show, not just our tests, but official government and law enforcement, and there's so many of them online, you just mentioned some that I'm aware of, we have the ballistics posted there.
[00:41:58.473 --> 00:42:00.035]  He doesn't go in over a millimeter.
[00:42:00.395 --> 00:42:08.946]  Well, in our test, we did actually find that it went in between one and three millimeters, but most of the BBs were stopped by the clothing.
[00:42:09.666 --> 00:42:11.749]  And it's scientific fact.
[00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:13.431]  Look at the spread.
[00:42:13.451 --> 00:42:14.092]  They're now saying
[00:42:15.029 --> 00:42:18.911]  The doctors saying Whittington had 200 bb's in him.
[00:42:19.511 --> 00:42:28.936]  Now there's only 265 bb's in that particular seven and a half load that he was shooting so I mean how close would you have to be again 15 to 18 feet
[00:42:30.297 --> 00:42:37.302]  For 200, or what is that, 80% of the BBs to actually hit you.
[00:42:37.322 --> 00:42:40.364]  So the whole story is a patent fraud.
[00:42:40.384 --> 00:42:52.933]  But now on top of that, we have Mary Madeline, his spokeswoman, screwing up, or some say it could be on purpose, saying, oh, we weren't even going to tell people who'd been shot or who'd done the shooting in our first press release.
[00:42:53.654 --> 00:42:56.302]  I mean, admitting they weren't even going to let us know what happened.
[00:42:56.382 --> 00:43:00.334]  So, it's just total deception, but there are conservatives.
[00:43:01.636 --> 00:43:15.523]  That are so-called conservatives, that if you told them Dick Cheney was a pig who had purple wings who could fly to the moon, and if Dick Cheney said that, they would argue with you and say that he's a little pig with purple wings that can fly to the moon.
[00:43:15.563 --> 00:43:17.424]  I mean, they just don't care about facts.
[00:43:17.504 --> 00:43:18.704]  It's about defending.
[00:43:19.305 --> 00:43:20.985]  First, Cheney says I wasn't drinking.
[00:43:21.045 --> 00:43:24.147]  Then it comes out that there's a photo of him drinking.
[00:43:24.407 --> 00:43:26.548]  So then they say, oh, we only had one.
[00:43:26.588 --> 00:43:28.089]  Well, now maybe we had more.
[00:43:29.169 --> 00:43:30.190]  It's all a lie.
[00:43:31.152 --> 00:43:41.578]  That's why the Secret Service wouldn't allow the local police to even talk to Cheney for 13 hours because they needed time for the alcohol to wash out of his system.
[00:43:41.818 --> 00:43:47.101]  Sir, when I went to the local gun shop to buy a gun, to go buy the .28 gauge to do the test,
[00:43:47.711 --> 00:43:51.853]  Most of the guys in there were fans of the show, were saying hi there at McBride's.
[00:43:52.153 --> 00:43:57.296]  Two of the people that worked there began to argue with me, saying you shouldn't talk bad about Bush.
[00:43:57.316 --> 00:43:58.416]  This is just buying a gun.
[00:43:59.196 --> 00:44:00.457]  He is an anti-gun.
[00:44:00.737 --> 00:44:03.679]  I've heard you say that he was for the assault weapons ban.
[00:44:03.719 --> 00:44:04.379]  That's a lie.
[00:44:04.839 --> 00:44:06.540]  It doesn't matter if he gave speeches for it.
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:08.762]  It doesn't matter if Gonzalez testified for it.
[00:44:08.782 --> 00:44:10.383]  It doesn't matter if he lobbied for it.
[00:44:10.403 --> 00:44:13.265]  It doesn't matter... I mean, they're just delusional, brother!
[00:44:13.506 --> 00:44:14.486]  They do not care!
[00:44:14.506 --> 00:44:27.316]  The problem is, Alex, when I had a talk show up in Gillette, Wyoming in 2003, I got fired because I refused to worship at the altar of the Republican Party or at the altar of Dick Cheney in his home state.
[00:44:27.776 --> 00:44:29.317]  And therein lies the problem.
[00:44:29.557 --> 00:44:31.379]  I gave advice to my listeners.
[00:44:31.579 --> 00:44:32.980]  I said, if you want to worship,
[00:44:33.396 --> 00:44:38.919]  Find a good Christian church and worship at its altar, but never ever worship at the altar of any political party.
[00:44:38.959 --> 00:44:39.620]  Brother, you're right.
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.141]  They worship Bill Clinton.
[00:44:41.181 --> 00:44:42.301]  They worship Hillary.
[00:44:42.622 --> 00:44:49.346]  I mean, Bill's pro-Iraq war, pro-Iran war, so's Hillary, but the Democrats are out praising him.
[00:44:49.446 --> 00:44:52.027]  I mean, they're exactly like Bush!
[00:44:52.387 --> 00:44:58.071]  They've been brainwashed in the same way that the people in Germany were brainwashed when Hitler was taking power.
[00:44:58.655 --> 00:45:03.319]  And he had his own man four weeks after he became Reich Chancellor set fire to the Reichstag.
[00:45:03.859 --> 00:45:17.049]  And then five days later on March 4th, 1933, he went before the Reichstag when it reconvened in the Kroll Opera Theater and said, look, I'd love to control this terrorism and give you law and order, but my hands are bound by the Constitution.
[00:45:17.069 --> 00:45:19.871]  You need to loosen these binds so I can give you law and order.
[00:45:19.931 --> 00:45:21.552]  And it's called the Enabling Act.
[00:45:21.572 --> 00:45:22.253]  The Enabling Act.
[00:45:22.313 --> 00:45:24.134]  And they passed it on March 23rd, 1933.
[00:45:24.535 --> 00:45:27.437]  And from then on, the police state was born.
[00:45:27.877 --> 00:45:30.939]  And that's exactly what George Bush is doing now.
[00:45:31.079 --> 00:45:33.281]  And they set up Reich security.
[00:45:33.361 --> 00:45:34.642]  What is Reich in German?
[00:45:34.802 --> 00:45:35.362]  Land.
[00:45:35.603 --> 00:45:36.924]  Land security.
[00:45:37.564 --> 00:45:43.128]  Well, the Third Reich was the Third Empire and George Bush is now overseeing the Fourth Reich.
[00:45:44.589 --> 00:45:47.671]  And his grandfather was one of the top Nazi agents in the U.S.
[00:45:47.991 --> 00:45:57.118]  And now there's a lawsuit that's been filed by the Indian tribe to try to get Geronimo's head returned from the Skull and Bones Lodge.
[00:45:57.611 --> 00:46:02.056]  To get it returned to its normal grave site because it had been robbed, as you well know.
[00:46:02.076 --> 00:46:02.837]  Yeah, Prescott.
[00:46:03.197 --> 00:46:04.138]  Yeah, Prescott stole it.
[00:46:05.034 --> 00:46:08.675]  So they're trying to get the head of Geronimo back to the grave site where it belongs.
[00:46:08.695 --> 00:46:20.637]  Well, I mean, all that aside, the shooting aside, the skull of Geronimo, all of this, any day the globalists could nuke or release the bird flu or do anything to then have the smoke screen to totally take over.
[00:46:20.657 --> 00:46:23.298]  And people go, why would they want to do that?
[00:46:23.758 --> 00:46:28.059]  Because under a police state, they get to take your pension funds, take your stocks.
[00:46:28.499 --> 00:46:30.140]  They get to take your private property.
[00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:31.660]  They've had the Supreme Court rule.
[00:46:32.885 --> 00:46:35.228]  Tyranny is about raping you.
[00:46:35.248 --> 00:46:39.212]  This tyranny isn't about getting them A-Rabs.
[00:46:39.553 --> 00:46:45.079]  You know, when you like to feel good driving around in your truck going, you gotta love Bush, get them A-Rabs.
[00:46:45.319 --> 00:46:47.442]  Hey, he ain't gonna get them A-Rabs, buddy.
[00:46:47.482 --> 00:46:48.383]  He's gonna get you.
[00:46:49.043 --> 00:46:50.365]  That's what it's all about.
[00:46:50.745 --> 00:46:53.228]  And there's so many good people who are just delusional.
[00:46:53.268 --> 00:46:57.452]  Listen, they'll just sit in my face and go, Bush wasn't for the assault weapons ban.
[00:46:57.672 --> 00:46:58.953]  They cannot compute.
[00:46:58.994 --> 00:47:01.096]  It's like Democrats that go, Hillary's not for the war.
[00:47:01.596 --> 00:47:02.137]  Yes, she is.
[00:47:02.177 --> 00:47:03.298]  She's more hawkish than Bush.
[00:47:03.758 --> 00:47:05.500]  Alex, that's just a lie.
[00:47:06.501 --> 00:47:07.102]  I mean, they're idiots.
[00:47:09.564 --> 00:47:22.213]  It's, again, the government releases the same report of Bin Laden saying, I want a truce, nanny nanny, boo boo, you'll never get me, I'm the gingerbread man, and they run it again this weekend like it's a new story.
[00:47:22.573 --> 00:47:30.298]  Well, when I was at the NRA convention last year when it was held here in Houston, I tried to tell the NRA bigwigs what a lowlife
[00:47:30.891 --> 00:47:31.171]  I don't
[00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:52.523]  Well, not all, not all.
[00:47:52.603 --> 00:48:01.472]  We had Bob Barr on about a month ago, and he said in all honesty, he went through examples, Bush is more anti-gun than Clinton, and he's on the NRA board.
[00:48:01.532 --> 00:48:02.613]  So that is a glimmer of hope.
[00:48:03.283 --> 00:48:12.887]  Well, hey, that helps, but he's one of the very few people up there... Oh, by the way, he was up at a big Republican meeting in Virginia last week, and everybody was getting up.
[00:48:12.967 --> 00:48:23.871]  I have the transcript saying, secret arrest is good, so what if there's a Constitution, we can trust Bush, and Barr got up and said, I can't believe you're saying this, and they booed him off the stage.
[00:48:24.711 --> 00:48:27.132]  They booed Barr off the stage?
[00:48:27.172 --> 00:48:29.453]  Yes, a bunch of brown shirt nuts.
[00:48:30.549 --> 00:48:31.689]  Well, they love it.
[00:48:31.729 --> 00:48:39.511]  I mean, these little nobody Republicans who go out and put out yard signs and have little minor chairmanships, you know, at county and city levels.
[00:48:39.891 --> 00:48:41.651]  I mean, they all feel like they're going to be part of it.
[00:48:41.671 --> 00:48:43.192]  They're getting off on it, brother.
[00:48:43.912 --> 00:48:45.572]  Listen, they put armbands on.
[00:48:45.812 --> 00:48:48.092]  They want to run around like a bunch of Soviet trash.
[00:48:48.313 --> 00:48:49.693]  They want to be commissariat.
[00:48:49.933 --> 00:48:52.193]  I hear them on the radio saying, ban free speech.
[00:48:53.514 --> 00:48:55.654]  Color-fit conservatives like Michael Reagan
[00:48:56.072 --> 00:49:13.166]  Who the local station in Beaumont, KLVI, has a clip from one of his broadcasts where he's arguing with a caller, and the caller is saying, no, I want Bush to abide by the Constitution, and Reagan is saying, oh no, but this is time of war, and I'm ready to surrender my rights to feel safe and secure.
[00:49:13.567 --> 00:49:14.988]  They're all brain dead.
[00:49:15.695 --> 00:49:22.577]  If you put them up on an electroencephalograph machine, you'll get a flat line from them because there is no brain wave activity.
[00:49:22.597 --> 00:49:23.877]  They're not brain dead, buddy.
[00:49:23.917 --> 00:49:27.298]  They know as a bunch of parasites that they're getting on the Nazi bandwagon.
[00:49:27.318 --> 00:49:29.959]  There's going to be, for party officials, there's going to be a lot of power.
[00:49:30.599 --> 00:49:33.800]  Oh yeah, and we're of course going to be on the short end of the stick.
[00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:34.720]  I hear you.
[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:35.680]  I appreciate the calm.
[00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:37.601]  Let's go to Joe in Wisconsin.
[00:49:37.641 --> 00:49:38.521]  Joe, you're on the air.
[00:49:38.581 --> 00:49:38.901]  Welcome.
[00:49:41.232 --> 00:49:43.313]  Hey, I had some unpleasantness this morning.
[00:49:43.514 --> 00:49:48.477]  I'm really concerned about some of the things on our local campus here.
[00:49:49.097 --> 00:49:58.404]  And I look back at what the 60s represented, and I know it's not common that we talk about things happening on the university.
[00:49:58.484 --> 00:50:01.085]  Usually it's about this debate or that debate.
[00:50:01.265 --> 00:50:07.590]  But I think there's a whole desensitizing program that they're putting in place.
[00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:08.931]  Okay, well tell us what's happening.
[00:50:10.226 --> 00:50:19.220]  They're not teaching business ethics anymore, and the last time I asked... Sir, they haven't had doctors and nurses give the Hippocratic Oath in a decade.
[00:50:19.801 --> 00:50:20.081]  God.
[00:50:20.922 --> 00:50:21.684]  Do no harm.
[00:50:21.724 --> 00:50:21.844]  Yeah.
[00:50:23.796 --> 00:50:28.899]  I believe that they're not teaching the business ethics because we didn't validate the upper level business courses.
[00:50:29.059 --> 00:50:34.621]  I've heard you talk about how you put mind control and manipulation into things.
[00:50:34.661 --> 00:50:35.262]  We'll stay there.
[00:50:35.322 --> 00:50:39.024]  I'll let you finish up when we get back.
[00:50:39.084 --> 00:50:41.965]  Wide open phones, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:50:42.025 --> 00:50:47.928]  I got this individual coming on who thinks having a microchip in him and his girlfriend is trendy-windy.
[00:50:48.963 --> 00:50:50.144]  And it's pretty ridiculous.
[00:50:50.164 --> 00:50:52.244]  He won't be on long, but we appreciate him joining us.
[00:50:52.604 --> 00:50:53.365]  That's coming up.
[00:50:53.465 --> 00:50:55.025]  And then, more news.
[00:50:55.265 --> 00:50:56.466]  The Iran War coming up.
[00:50:56.486 --> 00:50:56.926]  Stay with us.
[00:51:00.047 --> 00:51:01.507]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:01.727 --> 00:51:04.808]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:04.948 --> 00:51:08.850]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:13.231]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:51:13.471 --> 00:51:17.253]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:17.393 --> 00:51:18.473]  A civil emergency was created.
[00:51:18.473 --> 00:51:20.415]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:20.455 --> 00:51:25.580]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:40.815 --> 00:51:44.598]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:51:44.998 --> 00:51:46.379]  Order your video today.
[00:51:46.759 --> 00:51:47.760]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:50.061]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[00:51:50.121 --> 00:51:51.362]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[00:51:59.941 --> 00:52:02.945]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:52:03.285 --> 00:52:12.095]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:52:12.435 --> 00:52:17.101]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:17.561 --> 00:52:24.289]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:52:24.690 --> 00:52:36.444]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:36.944 --> 00:52:41.385]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:52:41.565 --> 00:52:43.886]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:43.906 --> 00:52:45.866]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:52:45.886 --> 00:52:47.087]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:52:47.167 --> 00:52:48.627]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:52:48.647 --> 00:52:49.647]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:02.788]  People who use Cartabite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:53:03.009 --> 00:53:06.396]  For over five years, Cartabite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:53:06.576 --> 00:53:10.043]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cartabite.
[00:53:10.313 --> 00:53:13.555]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:53:13.575 --> 00:53:19.038]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we've seen.
[00:53:19.078 --> 00:53:28.704]  When we do our programs, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[00:53:28.824 --> 00:53:30.205]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[00:53:30.225 --> 00:53:35.628]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead-on.
[00:53:36.108 --> 00:53:40.549]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[00:53:40.569 --> 00:53:42.010]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:45.611]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[00:53:45.631 --> 00:53:46.611]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[00:54:21.531 --> 00:54:29.522]  My friends, we've absolutely got to expose government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:54:30.803 --> 00:54:31.725]  And we've got to do it now.
[00:54:35.829 --> 00:54:44.257]  I want to remind you that last night I was up here doing research and the CIA's own website brags about how they carried out terror attacks.
[00:54:44.297 --> 00:54:47.059]  You don't just have to hear it from their retired agents.
[00:54:47.119 --> 00:54:55.166]  You can go read where they brag about how they like to blow things up, blow little kids up, and blame it on people.
[00:54:55.246 --> 00:54:56.788]  And then I've got to sit here and argue.
[00:54:57.248 --> 00:55:01.173]  All I'm doing is reading off the CIA.gov.
[00:55:01.613 --> 00:55:04.536]  And how can people work in government while this is going on?
[00:55:04.556 --> 00:55:05.117]  Well, I'll tell you.
[00:55:05.437 --> 00:55:07.860]  Most CIA employees aren't on their own website.
[00:55:08.241 --> 00:55:11.524]  Most CIA employees aren't in the National Security Archives online.
[00:55:11.965 --> 00:55:17.451]  They're just off compartmentalized, you know, listening to Mandarin transmissions on shortwave or
[00:55:18.103 --> 00:55:19.003]  We're good to go.
[00:55:32.458 --> 00:55:35.319]  Don't just sit here and go, oh Alex, he's making that stuff up.
[00:55:35.679 --> 00:55:38.279]  You better go check out what I'm saying.
[00:55:38.519 --> 00:55:40.620]  Last night I was getting chills over this.
[00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:50.082]  I was doing research for like five hours yesterday just on government sponsored terror and there were so many examples I wasn't even aware of and guess where I was reading about it?
[00:55:50.522 --> 00:55:52.262]  Our government's own websites.
[00:55:52.302 --> 00:55:53.382]  They're proud of it.
[00:55:53.862 --> 00:55:55.423]  I mean, that's got to freak you out.
[00:55:55.563 --> 00:55:56.603]  I know it freaks me out.
[00:55:57.538 --> 00:55:59.218]  Because they're going big time now.
[00:55:59.238 --> 00:56:03.219]  They're not just blowing up school buses or bombing churches or mosques and blaming it on people.
[00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:06.640]  They're talking about nukes going off, A-bombs going off.
[00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:08.581]  They're talking about putting us in FEMA camps.
[00:56:08.601 --> 00:56:11.942]  They're talking about how torture is good, and how torturing children is good.
[00:56:11.962 --> 00:56:16.803]  And they're doing all this sick stuff, and then you trust these people to run your economy?
[00:56:16.843 --> 00:56:19.003]  You trust them to control your life?
[00:56:19.063 --> 00:56:22.004]  You don't think they're going to abuse you if they're abusing everybody else?
[00:56:22.714 --> 00:56:26.316]  Everything we've been raining down on the rest of the world is now coming home to America.
[00:56:26.657 --> 00:56:27.877]  We're the big prize.
[00:56:27.957 --> 00:56:29.098]  We're what's being targeted.
[00:56:29.118 --> 00:56:37.063]  Now, before I go back to Joe and others that are holding, you need to get Road to Tyranny, my classic film about government-sponsored terror.
[00:56:37.083 --> 00:56:40.986]  It covers the first World Trade Center attack, Oklahoma City like no other film does, and then 9-11.
[00:56:42.937 --> 00:56:46.459]  And then on top of that, my new film, Martial Law, that details 9-11.
[00:56:46.579 --> 00:56:49.101]  It's so powerful.
[00:56:49.441 --> 00:56:50.902]  The latest information on it.
[00:56:51.262 --> 00:56:58.046]  And then there's my new documentary, The Order of Death, getting into the mindset and what drives these individuals and what they're into.
[00:56:58.146 --> 00:56:59.747]  You need these videos.
[00:56:59.868 --> 00:57:02.169]  Please, go to InfoWars.com.
[00:57:02.933 --> 00:57:04.235]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:57:04.615 --> 00:57:09.441]  Order hard copies of the films off the safe, secure online shopping cart and support what we're doing.
[00:57:09.901 --> 00:57:12.044]  And use these videos to wake people up in your area.
[00:57:12.284 --> 00:57:16.509]  And go to PrisonPlanet.tv and get an online membership and see it all online right now.
[00:57:16.569 --> 00:57:17.190]  Just check it out.
[00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:18.812]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:57:19.473 --> 00:57:20.134]  Let's go back to John.
[00:57:20.154 --> 00:57:21.395]  You've got about a minute and a half, John.
[00:57:21.435 --> 00:57:22.877]  Finish up what's going on at the college.
[00:57:23.459 --> 00:57:32.385]  Okay, I think what they're being taught is that only crises will get a response, and they're being given a warped sense of danger and morality.
[00:57:32.765 --> 00:57:36.487]  I think they're being taught to self-sacrifice for absolutely nothing.
[00:57:37.188 --> 00:57:44.492]  That these people, when they do commit chaos and mayhem, they won't draw much attention.
[00:57:44.733 --> 00:57:46.214]  That it'll just fly under the radar.
[00:57:46.294 --> 00:57:46.854]  Yeah, so what?
[00:57:47.518 --> 00:57:57.783]  I think they're being taught that avoidable dangers are to be ignored until they actually happen, and that only the symptoms are to be cured, not the underlying problem.
[00:57:58.603 --> 00:58:05.487]  I think they're being taught not to have a conscience, and to be evil... Well, sir, sir, our entire philosophy is being warped.
[00:58:05.567 --> 00:58:14.211]  I mean, when they're on TV saying torture's good, torturing children's good, the President is above the law, that's as warped as it gets.
[00:58:14.793 --> 00:58:15.213]  I agree.
[00:58:16.114 --> 00:58:28.804]  I'm almost certain, though, that the globalists are having meetings rented out in the Business Administration Building, and there was a $10 million donation given to that building, and 10% is to be used discretionary.
[00:58:29.004 --> 00:58:31.286]  You can do a lot with a million dollars.
[00:58:31.746 --> 00:58:32.907]  You can do a lot of damage.
[00:58:32.947 --> 00:58:35.009]  Well, there's all sorts of payoffs going on, sir.
[00:58:35.549 --> 00:58:36.790]  All right, we'll be right back.
[00:58:36.810 --> 00:58:37.331]  Stay with us.
[00:58:40.163 --> 00:58:45.644]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-376-45.
[00:58:46.024 --> 00:58:52.126]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:58:52.246 --> 00:58:59.367]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years, but what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:58:59.447 --> 00:59:06.109]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:59:06.329 --> 00:59:09.331]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:59:09.551 --> 00:59:11.912]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:59:12.052 --> 00:59:22.218]  Black-Murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as atrazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[00:59:22.418 --> 00:59:31.526]  MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[00:59:31.687 --> 00:59:39.454]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:59:39.474 --> 00:59:39.794]  That's 888-803-4438.

[00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:55.190]  Big Brother.
[00:59:55.850 --> 00:59:56.911]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:57.612 --> 00:59:58.733]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:59.393 --> 01:00:00.194]  You want answers?
[01:00:00.954 --> 01:00:01.855]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:02.515 --> 01:00:06.138]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:06.698 --> 01:00:10.861]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:13.463 --> 01:00:18.247]  Desperately trying to defend this republic from enemies, foreign and domestic,
[01:00:19.216 --> 01:00:25.220]  Coming up in the next segment, we're scheduled to have a guest on who thinks that getting an implantable microchip is just a wonderful thing.
[01:00:26.481 --> 01:00:31.065]  We'll look at that whole culture, how they're pushing it as a fad, as something trendy to do.
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.762]  And we're going to go ahead and take a couple calls right now.
[01:00:34.782 --> 01:00:38.224]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:38.265 --> 01:00:50.734]  And then coming up, we'll get into some of the latest Iran war buildup developments and some of the domestic police state things that are happening here in the United States.
[01:00:51.295 --> 01:00:52.155]  Who's up next?
[01:00:52.336 --> 01:00:53.396]  Who's next up in line?
[01:00:55.598 --> 01:00:57.860]  Okay, Hartwell, where are you calling from?
[01:00:59.376 --> 01:00:59.816]  Hartwell?
[01:01:00.217 --> 01:01:00.517]  Yes.
[01:01:00.857 --> 01:01:02.057]  I caught only half of your name.
[01:01:02.097 --> 01:01:02.878]  I don't know what happened there.
[01:01:02.898 --> 01:01:03.918]  I was cut off a little bit.
[01:01:04.018 --> 01:01:05.999]  Mine was cutting out, too, when they told me who it was.
[01:01:06.039 --> 01:01:06.279]  Yeah.
[01:01:06.719 --> 01:01:07.100]  Okay.
[01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:11.562]  Um, you mentioned getting people involved and waking up people.
[01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:13.102]  Let me tell you what I did.
[01:01:14.383 --> 01:01:22.646]  Yesterday, the 19th, on a Sunday, I planned a public showing of Beyond Treason at the library here in Abbeville, Louisiana.
[01:01:23.247 --> 01:01:24.787]  I advertised it well.
[01:01:25.147 --> 01:01:26.148]  I put it in the paper.
[01:01:26.681 --> 01:01:29.963]  I put flyers on windshields and on reference doors.
[01:01:31.123 --> 01:01:36.966]  Alex, other than a few of my friends, no one came.
[01:01:36.986 --> 01:01:37.686]  Not one person.
[01:01:38.007 --> 01:01:40.468]  Well, that's what you're advertising in the newspaper, sir.
[01:01:40.528 --> 01:01:46.931]  We put an ad in Craigslist for employees and get 200 responses and put one in the local paper and get 10 responses.
[01:01:47.771 --> 01:01:49.212]  Those things are paper tigers.
[01:01:49.272 --> 01:01:50.733]  That's not where the audiences are.
[01:01:52.319 --> 01:02:03.228]  If you would have gone to, say, ten churches and said, I want to just briefly talk to your congregation about depleted uranium, and gotten them to let you talk to them, put out flyers there, you'd have probably had a packed house.
[01:02:03.328 --> 01:02:08.312]  Or, if you'd have gotten on a local radio talk show for ten minutes to talk about it, you would have had a packed house.
[01:02:09.133 --> 01:02:12.135]  The newspapers, the old line media is a joke.
[01:02:12.495 --> 01:02:16.899]  Their only power is that some of us still read them, and then regurgitate what they're saying.
[01:02:18.906 --> 01:02:22.248]  Americans predominantly don't read, they watch television.
[01:02:22.588 --> 01:02:31.173]  Well no, look, I put ads in the paper then I got out on the streets with flyers and I talked with people and they told me that they read my ad in the paper.
[01:02:31.833 --> 01:02:35.615]  Then I talked with them about depleted uranium and what it was doing to our troops.
[01:02:36.516 --> 01:02:41.959]  I did go to churches, I talked to people there, I talked to pastors and not
[01:02:42.598 --> 01:02:45.440]  One person showed up other than a few of my friends.
[01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:51.184]  Well, I've had the exact opposite response and most people I know do, but I have no doubt that what happened to you has happened.
[01:02:52.645 --> 01:02:56.408]  So, what would you like me to... I'm trying to... What's the point of this?
[01:02:56.748 --> 01:03:00.531]  The point of this is that I just can't believe that I found that people is...
[01:03:01.024 --> 01:03:03.206]  People are as stupid as I found them to be.
[01:03:03.567 --> 01:03:04.628]  And I don't know what to do.
[01:03:04.668 --> 01:03:06.750]  I'd like to do something, but I don't know what to do.
[01:03:07.251 --> 01:03:09.313]  Well, uh, duty is ours.
[01:03:09.373 --> 01:03:10.835]  Consequences belong to God.
[01:03:10.875 --> 01:03:12.056]  And you did the right thing, sir.
[01:03:12.116 --> 01:03:13.437]  And I would tell you, don't give up.
[01:03:13.898 --> 01:03:14.719]  Well, I won't give up.
[01:03:14.919 --> 01:03:15.680]  I'll keep punching.
[01:03:17.302 --> 01:03:19.144]  Uh, thank you so much for what you're doing.
[01:03:19.164 --> 01:03:21.246]  There's people like you that supports me.
[01:03:21.566 --> 01:03:23.088]  Well, sir, I appreciate you, but listen.
[01:03:23.875 --> 01:03:31.401]  Number one, we've gone from a nation of people who are involved on the field as participants to a nation of spectators.
[01:03:33.534 --> 01:03:37.076]  Slothful, lazy population in the world, predominantly.
[01:03:38.616 --> 01:03:43.939]  When it comes to political action being involved, people are scared to go to a meeting.
[01:03:44.419 --> 01:03:46.200]  They've heard about the NSA spying.
[01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:48.321]  They've heard about people being watched.
[01:03:48.461 --> 01:03:49.941]  And so, people are afraid.
[01:03:49.981 --> 01:03:53.163]  That chilling effect has been engaged in for a reason.
[01:03:53.623 --> 01:03:55.784]  I'll tell you what is effective is making copies
[01:03:56.384 --> 01:04:06.691]  of documentaries, and you're authorized to do that with my films for non-profit educational purposes, and then giving copies of those to individuals who already show an interest.
[01:04:06.771 --> 01:04:10.833]  Don't cast your pearls before swine, before pigs.
[01:04:11.634 --> 01:04:13.655]  Go out to those that do care and are involved.
[01:04:13.695 --> 01:04:17.978]  And by the way, no country's ever been saved, or no people's ever been saved by a majority.
[01:04:18.338 --> 01:04:21.040]  It was 3% at the start of the war against King George III.
[01:04:22.421 --> 01:04:25.503]  And it was 5% that won that war, brother.
[01:04:25.984 --> 01:04:31.548]  So, uh, just because most people are drooling furniture doesn't mean that we're going to lose this fight.
[01:04:31.588 --> 01:04:35.272]  People are waking up big time, so chin up and you keep it up.
[01:04:35.852 --> 01:04:39.816]  Alright, folks, we'll be right back after this quick break with our scheduled guest.
[01:04:40.236 --> 01:04:43.419]  The website is rinfowars.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[01:04:43.799 --> 01:04:44.299]  Stay with us.
[01:04:51.355 --> 01:05:06.225]  If you run a retail business of any kind, a restaurant, a bar, a carpet store, even a tanning salon, just to name a few, and you need money to grow or run your business, let me explain how a new idea from a company called AmeriMerchant can help you get the money you need.
[01:05:06.445 --> 01:05:10.908]  When your customers spend money in your store, many of them use Visa and MasterCard, right?
[01:05:11.048 --> 01:05:14.831]  Well, what a Merrimerchant does is advance you money against those sales.
[01:05:15.051 --> 01:05:23.056]  For example, if your store does $25,000 in Visa or MasterCard sales, we'll advance you a portion of those monthly sales.
[01:05:23.237 --> 01:05:32.383]  You can use the money for any reason or purpose, but you must have a minimum of $5,000 a month in combined Visa or MasterCard sales to qualify.
[01:05:32.503 --> 01:05:41.249]  There are no closing costs, you can have the money in as little as 7 days, and we approve 90% of all qualified applicants, so call right now!
[01:05:41.269 --> 01:05:41.769]  800-430-7568, 800-430-7568, that's 800-430-7568.
[01:05:51.295 --> 01:06:02.007]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:06:02.187 --> 01:06:09.775]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:06:09.995 --> 01:06:13.160]  Farmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to the low detectable level.
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:19.189]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:06:19.470 --> 01:06:25.619]  Made of durable lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[01:06:25.959 --> 01:06:29.860]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:31.781]  The water level is always visible.
[01:06:31.981 --> 01:06:37.923]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:06:38.163 --> 01:06:42.105]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:07:11.545 --> 01:07:18.969]  You have the opportunity to wear vitamins, minerals, and nutrients that absorb through your skin rather than taking them orally.
[01:07:19.490 --> 01:07:21.211]  This is real, not science fiction.
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:30.602]  Go to TriVortex.com, that is T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com to open a whole new realm of health and vitality for you and your family.
[01:07:33.063 --> 01:07:42.705]  This is Brian David Anderson, inventor of TriVortex technology products that assist in so many areas such as pain relief, symptoms of menopause, losing weight, or stopping smoking.
[01:07:43.225 --> 01:07:47.126]  TriVortex technology is in harmony with the rhythms of nature.
[01:07:54.694 --> 01:07:55.335]  Big Brother.
[01:07:56.016 --> 01:07:57.036]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:57.777 --> 01:07:58.898]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:59.539 --> 01:08:00.359]  You want answers?
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:02.001]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:02.681 --> 01:08:06.304]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:06.865 --> 01:08:10.948]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:13.371 --> 01:08:17.936]  More of your calls coming up later.
[01:08:18.176 --> 01:08:23.702]  We'll get more into the new Bin Laden tape, which is really a month old, but announced by the news as new.
[01:08:24.583 --> 01:08:30.509]  And then even the older tapes they've been airing, they admit, are re-edited, re-packaged.
[01:08:31.827 --> 01:08:44.633]  Video tapes from before 9-11 and then right after 9-11, but they repackage them, recut them, and then say they're new threats, and then quietly a week later say, oh no, really, it was an old tape.
[01:08:44.973 --> 01:08:51.536]  But that certainly works to scare the people and do, oh, maybe the Patriot Act being reauthorized and expanded is good.
[01:08:51.556 --> 01:08:53.657]  Oh, maybe the police state is good.
[01:08:53.777 --> 01:08:55.958]  Oh, everything, everything is wonderful.
[01:08:56.767 --> 01:09:15.548]  Now our guest joins us today and he's got this book RFID Toys and I remember reading a January 2000 Pentagon battle plan put out by the Army and it was republished by the Federation of American Scientists and it said
[01:09:16.028 --> 01:09:16.689]  You can go read it.
[01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:20.711]  It's actually in my book, 9-11, Descent into Tyranny, a reprint of it.
[01:09:21.052 --> 01:09:22.492]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[01:09:22.512 --> 01:09:26.235]  You can link through right to the Defense Department if you'd like to read about it.
[01:09:26.535 --> 01:09:33.460]  They said we're going to sell implantable microchips for the entire population and by 2020 force everyone to take it.
[01:09:34.196 --> 01:09:39.499]  By making security personnel and the military take it, but also making it trendy.
[01:09:39.699 --> 01:09:41.520]  Selling it as if it's popular.
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:43.501]  Selling it as if it's cool.
[01:09:43.921 --> 01:09:53.546]  Then I had a Washington Post reporter on a year later, their tech writer for Wash Tech, and he said, yes, that's how they're going to sell it, is to the body modification crowd.
[01:09:54.006 --> 01:10:04.193]  You see, it isn't cool to have an original mind, or write something original, or truly do something original for humanity, or to do something moral.
[01:10:04.673 --> 01:10:11.718]  What is different and radical is to say, chop a couple of your fingers off, or shoot yourself with a .357 Magnum in the shoulder.
[01:10:11.778 --> 01:10:14.239]  That's part of the new body modification art.
[01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:15.320]  Real popular.
[01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:19.683]  Or have both your legs cut off, because it's a turn-on for your sexual partner.
[01:10:20.223 --> 01:10:21.224]  Oh, you think I'm joking?
[01:10:21.664 --> 01:10:22.925]  That's getting quite popular.
[01:10:23.385 --> 01:10:26.286]  Now, I'm not equating taking an implantable microchip to that.
[01:10:26.326 --> 01:10:31.509]  It's just funny that we're here six years ago telling you from the Pentagon how this would emerge.
[01:10:32.387 --> 01:10:34.748]  And now different surveillance tech companies in the U.S.
[01:10:35.108 --> 01:10:36.429]  are telling their employees to take it.
[01:10:36.489 --> 01:10:42.692]  The Mexican Attorney General, now a year ago, told his employees, if you want to come to work, take the implantable microchip.
[01:10:43.193 --> 01:10:54.738]  But then you've got all the trendies, all the really cool people, now, you know, this culture, who just, these cyborgs, totally hip, man, they're down with it.
[01:10:54.818 --> 01:10:59.581]  And one of them joins us, and I appreciate Amal, or
[01:11:00.602 --> 01:11:04.644]  Amul, I don't know how you pronounce it, Grafsta, joining us.
[01:11:05.505 --> 01:11:07.466]  I'm probably getting both those names wrong.
[01:11:07.486 --> 01:11:11.568]  Your name's A-M-A-L, but I'm told you pronounce it Amul, I guess?
[01:11:12.349 --> 01:11:12.989]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:11:13.009 --> 01:11:14.550]  It's a Dutch derivative.
[01:11:14.850 --> 01:11:24.575]  Now, I'm not as cool as you, so let me just say right now, I'm kind of a nerd, and I don't have tats all over me or anything, but just thank you for joining us.
[01:11:24.796 --> 01:11:27.397]  You and your girlfriend have microchips, and you're totally awesome.
[01:11:29.645 --> 01:11:32.206]  Well, I guess that's been the perception.
[01:11:32.226 --> 01:11:35.307]  Some of us just aren't as cool.
[01:11:35.887 --> 01:11:37.788]  And you're on the radio getting to talk about your book, too.
[01:11:38.568 --> 01:11:39.608]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:11:39.628 --> 01:11:48.171]  I never thought about anything happening because of my personal experiments.
[01:11:48.491 --> 01:11:49.911]  That's how this all started.
[01:11:50.012 --> 01:11:54.233]  I just wanted to get into my house without having my keys.
[01:11:54.513 --> 01:11:57.874]  And then all of a sudden, some friends wanted some pictures, so I put them up.
[01:11:58.658 --> 01:12:01.000]  And then it just became this huge thing.
[01:12:01.541 --> 01:12:03.683]  Is that what happened with your RFID book?
[01:12:04.663 --> 01:12:13.912]  Um, yeah, actually Wiley Publishing, you know, they called me up and they said, you know, well, what are you, the guy interviewing me is like, you know, we want to interview you for whatever.
[01:12:14.512 --> 01:12:21.999]  And so I'm like, okay, so I'm listening, you know, to him and about halfway through the interview, he stops me and says, well, I'm not really interviewing you.
[01:12:22.019 --> 01:12:24.121]  I want to, I want to see if you're crazy or not.
[01:12:24.723 --> 01:12:25.745]  And it doesn't seem so.
[01:12:25.845 --> 01:12:32.963]  So we want you to write this book, you know, details how to actually leverage this technology and build these different, you know,
[01:12:34.353 --> 01:12:39.156]  And of course all these big reports are coming out about how easy it is to get somebody's data off the chip.
[01:12:40.136 --> 01:12:45.640]  There's a lot of security experts are saying it'll cause people to have body parts severed by criminals.
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:50.683]  It's actually a very unsecure form of identification.
[01:12:50.723 --> 01:12:52.825]  But I mean, that's just the facts.
[01:12:52.865 --> 01:12:53.665]  Who cares about that?
[01:12:53.905 --> 01:12:57.468]  What do you think about the Mexican Attorney General making his employees take microchips?
[01:12:58.806 --> 01:13:01.608]  Um, yeah, that's actually part of the issue.
[01:13:01.648 --> 01:13:14.438]  I mean, I'm going to be speaking in Seattle about that, because, I mean, even in the book it says, you know, there's obvious security issues with this technology, and it's really only fit for kind of personal experimentation and personal use.
[01:13:14.718 --> 01:13:15.239]  Oh, really?
[01:13:15.279 --> 01:13:15.759]  Wait a minute.
[01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:22.965]  We just barely beat a bill in Texas that was going to put tracker chips, RFID, and all inspection stickers, but they don't care.
[01:13:23.025 --> 01:13:26.828]  They're going ahead and putting up all the radio readers to track our every move right now.
[01:13:27.782 --> 01:13:28.363]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:13:28.803 --> 01:13:31.566]  I mean, you know, the Mexican Attorney General, he's using Verichip.
[01:13:32.747 --> 01:13:39.813]  And the CityWatch company that's using it for their employees, they're also using Verichip.
[01:13:40.574 --> 01:13:43.316]  Well, that's a motley crew over there with the Attorney General.
[01:13:44.197 --> 01:13:47.300]  So what's your take on people saying, hey, you want to work here, you've got to take the chip?
[01:13:48.432 --> 01:13:49.573]  I think that's kind of ridiculous.
[01:13:49.693 --> 01:13:55.696]  Actually, I mean, this has always been a personal choice and it should always be something like that.
[01:13:55.716 --> 01:14:01.378]  Yeah, but in the future, if you want a cell phone, that's just what it's offered with, with the chip for everyone's security.
[01:14:01.398 --> 01:14:11.043]  So you don't have to have a cell phone, and you don't have to work here if you don't want to have a drug test or take a chip, and you don't have to have a car if you don't want a chip, and you don't have to come outside your house if you don't have the chip.
[01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:15.802]  Yeah, I mean, the thing is, it's like any kind of tracking.
[01:14:15.942 --> 01:14:18.484]  I mean, if you have a cell phone, you're triangulated.
[01:14:18.524 --> 01:14:21.045]  If you use credit cards, you're tracked anyway.
[01:14:21.065 --> 01:14:23.046]  Yeah, that's the argument.
[01:14:23.086 --> 01:14:30.030]  It's like if you already have one broken leg, hell, let's break both arms and break your skull and break your ribcage and both your collarbones while we're at it.
[01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:31.550]  I mean, let's be evil Knievel.
[01:14:31.771 --> 01:14:36.213]  Hell, if we've already got some problems and we're already losing all of our privacy, why not go all the way?
[01:14:37.268 --> 01:14:47.391]  Well, the funny thing is, I mean, I'm really not frightened about RFID used in that manner because it's a passive type technology where you can easily mess with it.
[01:14:47.471 --> 01:14:55.293]  You know, it's not like a cell phone where you want to receive calls and make calls, you know, and you want to buy stuff with your credit card.
[01:14:55.333 --> 01:15:03.955]  But like with RFID, where it's embedded in clothing or whatever, you know, if you wanted to subvert the technology, it's rather easy to do.
[01:15:04.591 --> 01:15:16.598]  Oh, but then that makes it even worse that they're now trying to make it the industry standard with the Defense Department and Walmart colluding to force all retailers and suppliers to adopt it.
[01:15:16.638 --> 01:15:17.379]  Were you aware of that?
[01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:19.800]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:27.605]  I mean, that's part of the privacy issue, particularly around clothing, like RFID tags embedded in clothing.
[01:15:29.118 --> 01:15:30.860]  Already in hundreds of brands, yes.
[01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:36.485]  Yeah, I mean, obviously the concern is that you don't remove the tag or you're unaware of it.
[01:15:37.426 --> 01:15:43.792]  You know, you're walking around with something that could... Well, I've seen all these people wallowing around on the websites.
[01:15:43.892 --> 01:15:45.994]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:15:46.395 --> 01:15:51.620]  I don't have devil horn mods on my head, or I have it 45'd myself.
[01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:52.721]  I've got chips.
[01:15:53.548 --> 01:15:56.390]  And it's just, my God, a chippy.
[01:15:57.551 --> 01:15:59.812]  I mean, do you see yourself in that camp?
[01:15:59.832 --> 01:16:04.415]  Because I'm actually glad to hear that you don't think we should be made to take the love chips.
[01:16:04.795 --> 01:16:09.118]  But speaking of love chips, your girlfriend's got one, doesn't she?
[01:16:09.899 --> 01:16:11.039]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:15.102]  At first she was like, well, you know, there's no point for me to get one, and I don't really want one.
[01:16:15.622 --> 01:16:16.563]  And, you know, I was cool with that.
[01:16:16.583 --> 01:16:17.023]  That's fine.
[01:16:17.083 --> 01:16:19.625]  Because I just wanted to, you know, play around with it.
[01:16:19.665 --> 01:16:21.046]  And actually, I put it in.
[01:16:21.787 --> 01:16:24.228]  Um, with the thought that I would be taking it out later.
[01:16:24.748 --> 01:16:27.849]  Um, because removal is just a very simple process.
[01:16:27.869 --> 01:16:28.729]  Who made your chip?
[01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:33.090]  Um, the chip that I have, I have two actually, I have one in each hand.
[01:16:33.891 --> 01:16:40.212]  Um, so the one in the left hand was made by, uh, it's an EM4102, it's just a read-only, uh, chip.
[01:16:40.292 --> 01:16:44.674]  It's, you know, general purpose ID that's kind of unique, set at the factory.
[01:16:44.714 --> 01:16:49.055]  But see, in the future, to be really trendy, you'll have to have the Zig 7 Vulcan Zlatomato.
[01:16:49.873 --> 01:16:50.473]  Yeah, good.
[01:16:50.573 --> 01:17:04.839]  I mean, they're trying to come up with other... I mean, the contactless, wireless, no battery, passive type features of it make it, you know, kind of ideal for other types of technologies like blood testing and, you know, temperature sensing.
[01:17:04.979 --> 01:17:16.583]  So, you know, the idea is that they want to come up with something where you can have this implant that not only is used for identification, but, you know, you can get your temperature read and, you know, diabetics can get blood tests.
[01:17:16.623 --> 01:17:18.884]  So why does your girlfriend decide she wanted this?
[01:17:19.850 --> 01:17:33.175]  Um, she just decided she wanted it because she wanted to kind of use all the benefits and features that I've been using for, you know, a year, like getting into a house without keys and, you know, logging into the computer, you know, that kind of stuff.
[01:17:33.235 --> 01:17:36.256]  So she asked me about it and was like, well, does it hurt?
[01:17:36.316 --> 01:17:37.356]  Does it, can you feel it?
[01:17:37.776 --> 01:17:40.537]  Is it, what, what are the dangers, you know, the risks and all that?
[01:17:41.110 --> 01:17:46.733]  And, you know, she saw that it wasn't really... I wasn't having any health risks or anything from it, so she's like, sure, you know.
[01:17:46.753 --> 01:17:51.616]  Well, I saw a website similar to yours where they're talking about how great it is to have the doors open for you.
[01:17:51.896 --> 01:17:53.517]  How about we just cut our arms off?
[01:17:53.557 --> 01:17:55.758]  It'd be so much easier just to have chips do it for us.
[01:17:55.798 --> 01:18:03.582]  I mean, having to turn the doorknob and open the door, and yeah, having to, you know, having to hit enter on the computer with your finger, that's so much harder.
[01:18:03.782 --> 01:18:05.283]  Why not just wave your chip?
[01:18:05.663 --> 01:18:06.283]  It's so much cooler.
[01:18:07.853 --> 01:18:12.157]  Well, that's funny, because that is part of the issue.
[01:18:12.177 --> 01:18:17.903]  I mean, people that come to me and they ask me about it, they're like, well, can I use it for a light switch, or can I use it for this?
[01:18:18.504 --> 01:18:21.046]  And I'm like, well, you can, but why?
[01:18:21.106 --> 01:18:24.670]  Your finger is much more efficient at flipping a light switch, you know what I mean?
[01:18:25.106 --> 01:18:39.620]  Like, it's not really meant for that type of use, where it's... But you admit that the technology is imminently penetrable and wide open, much more easy to hack into than a credit card in your pocket.
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:42.703]  Somebody can just walk up and scan your chip from a distance.
[01:18:43.363 --> 01:18:44.965]  Well, then why do you think it's so cool?
[01:18:46.121 --> 01:18:50.523]  Well, I mean, you have to look at it, too, in the context of what it's being used for.
[01:18:50.623 --> 01:18:56.687]  So, I mean, from a distance, with implants, that means, you know, four inches, maybe six inches max.
[01:18:57.647 --> 01:19:04.571]  You know, so, it's still possible, yes, for somebody to sneak up on me, get my CHIP ID, and, you know, run off to my house and get in.
[01:19:05.031 --> 01:19:14.797]  But, you know, if you look at it in the context of, okay, here's a business using it for high security, like Mexican Attorney General, or payment systems like SpeedPass, or
[01:19:16.178 --> 01:19:19.359]  But you just said it was silly to have to do that.
[01:19:19.899 --> 01:19:25.740]  But you just said it was bad that the Mexican Attorney General was doing that, but now you're saying it's a plus.
[01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:29.201]  Bottom line, sir, I believe technology is neutral.
[01:19:29.541 --> 01:19:34.942]  I'm not against technology, but I am against how this entire infrastructure is being set up.
[01:19:35.662 --> 01:19:38.843]  And I'm sure you've heard about the camps and Bush above the law.
[01:19:38.883 --> 01:19:42.624]  I mean, did you know the Carlisle group's involved in pushing all this chipping?
[01:19:43.561 --> 01:19:44.321]  I hadn't heard about that.
[01:19:44.721 --> 01:19:45.761]  Tell you what, stay there.

[01:24:19.558 --> 01:24:25.059]  I mean, the Pentagon comes out and says, we're going to have trendy Wendy's.
[01:24:25.099 --> 01:24:26.340]  That's Paul Watson's term.
[01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:30.821]  Come out and push this is cutting edge and all the stupid squares.
[01:24:31.461 --> 01:24:34.241]  Daddy-o, baby, they don't know.
[01:24:34.461 --> 01:24:36.642]  Yeah, I got it all now.
[01:24:37.442 --> 01:24:39.383]  And really it's going in all your products.
[01:24:39.423 --> 01:24:40.643]  It's tracking everything you do.
[01:24:40.724 --> 01:24:42.004]  It's going to track you down the road.
[01:24:42.444 --> 01:24:46.546]  And your kids are going to be, I'm getting the new IM-12 mega chip and you can't stop me.
[01:24:46.706 --> 01:24:50.067]  There's a new congressional law saying as soon as I'm 10, I'm allowed to have it.
[01:24:50.487 --> 01:24:53.869]  Well, your child doesn't have to be in with the rest of the class if they don't want to take their chip.
[01:24:54.449 --> 01:24:58.874]  Well, they can go down the hall where those weird Amish type kids are at.
[01:24:59.214 --> 01:25:07.964]  This is where it's all going, and it's a control grid, it's crud technology, it's useless, and we need to keep the human body the way it is.
[01:25:09.505 --> 01:25:16.253]  It's the same with the genetic engineering, it's all out of control, totally wild, with no looking at the repercussions.
[01:25:16.693 --> 01:25:30.422]  And then there's all these people, the Chipsons and the rest of them, and Get Chipped Today, and it turns out they're stockholders in Applied Digital, remember the Jacobsons, and just all of it, and the Applied Digital claiming that they're going to put
[01:25:33.867 --> 01:25:37.170]  Chip Readers and all the hospitals and claiming they had it in eight different hospitals.
[01:25:37.210 --> 01:25:38.712]  Turns out it was all a lie.
[01:25:39.472 --> 01:25:43.817]  And then we had the CEO on and he said, oh yes, everyone will submit to the chip.
[01:25:43.877 --> 01:25:45.879]  Everyone's gonna get the chip.
[01:25:46.179 --> 01:25:51.925]  And then I had that police chief on from Bergen County, the Bergen County police chief in New Jersey.
[01:25:53.162 --> 01:25:54.523]  A county with two million people in it.
[01:25:54.964 --> 01:25:58.026]  And he said on air, he said, yes, I've taken the chip.
[01:25:58.066 --> 01:25:59.126]  I want my police to take it.
[01:25:59.506 --> 01:26:01.708]  And I believe the government's going to make you take the chip.
[01:26:01.748 --> 01:26:03.689]  We have the transcript and the audio on the website.
[01:26:04.009 --> 01:26:06.111]  And yes, our plan is to make you take it.
[01:26:06.351 --> 01:26:09.353]  And I will come at gunpoint and make the citizens take it.
[01:26:09.633 --> 01:26:11.074]  Okay, we're that far along.
[01:26:11.114 --> 01:26:13.315]  That's the Houston police chief last week.
[01:26:13.496 --> 01:26:15.397]  They want to put cameras in all the homes now.
[01:26:16.443 --> 01:26:25.447]  And so you get people who might be nice folks, and he might be a nice guy, Amol Grafstra, and we got a link to his website on Infowars.com.
[01:26:25.667 --> 01:26:27.247]  I'm being a little bit hard on him here.
[01:26:27.787 --> 01:26:29.148]  It's just I can't figure it out.
[01:26:29.688 --> 01:26:30.929]  I can't understand Amol.
[01:26:30.969 --> 01:26:39.372]  You've got to see how it's the most untrendy thing you can do to have a microchip that's just a stupid gadget that basically does nothing for you.
[01:26:39.592 --> 01:26:41.973]  I mean, what does it do for you that your finger can't do?
[01:26:43.114 --> 01:26:50.437]  Yeah, I mean, I'm the first to admit that the actual use of it is kind of just for my own real entertainment.
[01:26:50.537 --> 01:26:52.118]  It's only good for tracking people.
[01:26:52.738 --> 01:26:54.919]  Yeah, well, I don't know how much it could track me.
[01:26:54.979 --> 01:27:03.003]  I mean, the read range on these types of things is real short, but I mean, it will basically... Not the new Pentagon ships.
[01:27:03.063 --> 01:27:04.303]  They're hundreds of yards.
[01:27:05.584 --> 01:27:07.245]  I'm talking about where this is going, sir.
[01:27:08.025 --> 01:27:08.445]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:08.585 --> 01:27:09.766]  I mean, where it's going is...
[01:27:10.336 --> 01:27:14.560]  Not what I had in mind for me at any time, actually.
[01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:20.384]  I mean, this is all kind of a new thing as far as, like, the broad reach of this issue.
[01:27:21.225 --> 01:27:29.052]  The social impacts of what I've seen from having this ship have kind of, like, you know, made me more aware of the broader issues.
[01:27:29.112 --> 01:27:32.014]  Whereas before, I mean, RFID's not my specialty.
[01:27:32.074 --> 01:27:32.895]  It's not my focus.
[01:27:32.955 --> 01:27:35.277]  It's not anything to do with my business.
[01:27:35.317 --> 01:27:36.578]  But now you know all about it.
[01:27:37.293 --> 01:27:38.115]  No, I know all about it.
[01:27:38.156 --> 01:27:41.084]  I had to learn and become a man.
[01:27:41.144 --> 01:27:43.330]  So what do you and your girlfriend use the chip for?
[01:27:44.666 --> 01:27:51.407]  Just simple stuff, like instead of punching in a pin code at my front door, I just wave the chip instead.
[01:27:51.607 --> 01:27:56.308]  Well, sir, there's something behind hundreds of articles a month promoting RFID.
[01:27:56.669 --> 01:27:59.989]  It's fun, it's cute, it's a toy, it's neat.
[01:28:00.609 --> 01:28:02.470]  And it's this full court press.
[01:28:02.970 --> 01:28:08.491]  Three years ago, there was a big meeting in Chicago, the big RFID consortium met, and they had a big convention.
[01:28:08.511 --> 01:28:10.271]  And they openly, we have the transcripts of it.
[01:28:11.312 --> 01:28:13.392]  Katherine Albrecht was there, and they were talking about
[01:28:14.975 --> 01:28:17.276]  80% of the public hates it, but they will submit.
[01:28:17.416 --> 01:28:22.397]  Our Pentagon program is projected for total takeover within... Do you understand what this is about?
[01:28:22.437 --> 01:28:33.200]  This is about creating in cyberspace a tracker on every item, every person, every car, and then instead of Google just searching the web, it will search reality.
[01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:37.521]  It is about merging this dimension into cyberspace.
[01:28:37.661 --> 01:28:40.122]  That's what the Pentagon says, Bubba.
[01:28:41.142 --> 01:28:41.362]  Sure.
[01:28:42.923 --> 01:28:43.563]  I don't doubt it.
[01:28:44.235 --> 01:28:49.316]  That's kind of always been the goal of, you know, Powers of B, no matter what the technology is.
[01:28:49.596 --> 01:28:59.158]  But that ain't good, brother, so you aren't helping putting the chip in yourself, and writing books about how fun it is, and aren't you a star, and oh my gosh, and this is so great.
[01:28:59.558 --> 01:29:13.580]  You know, I'd rather interview you because you're out with a hidden video camera exposing corrupt New York cops or something, instead of, or have you on because you've written some great piece of literature, instead of because you've got a microchip and you're having fun with your toy.
[01:29:16.255 --> 01:29:17.636]  Well, I don't want to beat you up anymore.
[01:29:17.676 --> 01:29:19.938]  You can go if you want, or you can stay and take some calls.
[01:29:19.958 --> 01:29:20.458]  What do you want to do?
[01:29:21.079 --> 01:29:21.639]  Sure, I'll stay.
[01:29:22.299 --> 01:29:30.926]  Alright, folks, I know we've got other callers holding from previously with the serious issues of the looming Iran war and just everything that's happening in the concentration camps.

[01:34:10.484 --> 01:34:37.665]  The places where you used to play It was an inside joke by the well-connected You're a sinner's protest so merrily rejected It was an inside joke like it always is Chalk it up to cynicism

[01:35:39.030 --> 01:35:59.302]  Welcome back.
[01:36:00.122 --> 01:36:04.285]  Amal Grafstra is our guest and I appreciate him holding through that break with us.
[01:36:06.420 --> 01:36:08.981]  Well, we're going to go ahead now and go back to Amal.
[01:36:09.081 --> 01:36:11.061]  Amal, I've been running all over you.
[01:36:11.821 --> 01:36:12.941]  Any points you want to make?
[01:36:13.581 --> 01:36:22.223]  I guess you're kind of a promoter, at least with your book, RFID Toys, or this author that contacted you and wanted to, with a major publisher, promote RFID.
[01:36:22.243 --> 01:36:23.123]  Surprise, surprise.
[01:36:23.503 --> 01:36:27.204]  The entire industry, the entire country behind it.
[01:36:28.905 --> 01:36:29.625]  Give us your take.
[01:36:29.665 --> 01:36:30.405]  What are you about?
[01:36:30.485 --> 01:36:31.185]  What is this about?
[01:36:32.790 --> 01:36:39.914]  I mean, well, basically, it always was, you know, for me, a personal venture into RFID and its uses.
[01:36:40.995 --> 01:36:42.695]  It's become much more than that, obviously.
[01:36:43.776 --> 01:36:57.103]  But, you know, essentially, my thought is that becoming aware of these larger issues and these plans, I mean, the people that are kind of of this, you know, cool club of chipped, you know,
[01:37:00.267 --> 01:37:09.342]  In that group, there's the kind of people that are kind of, you know, maybe more like me, kind of technically interested in RFID, want to know more about how it functions.
[01:37:09.795 --> 01:37:10.275]  We're good to go!
[01:37:41.397 --> 01:37:47.440]  We're going to be the ones to probably combat it more, you know, fervently than the other people.
[01:37:47.500 --> 01:38:04.487]  So, I think, you know, my thoughts are, you know, after learning about RFID and its vulnerabilities, its, you know, security issues, things like that, you know, for me to use it in my personal life and have complete control over it, I see that as positive.
[01:38:04.727 --> 01:38:06.908]  You know, and other people doing the same might see that as positive.
[01:38:07.216 --> 01:38:07.676]  We're good to go.
[01:38:26.013 --> 01:38:34.640]  They were going to make prisoners take it, and the California Bureau of Prisons two years ago signed a deal to take RFID and implant their prisoners.
[01:38:34.660 --> 01:38:38.083]  Then there was a public outcry, so they backed off, but that was in Reuters.
[01:38:38.643 --> 01:38:42.486]  And then there is the crowd that does it because it's cool.
[01:38:43.047 --> 01:38:48.872]  And the government, the media, the PR moguls said it was cool.
[01:38:49.779 --> 01:39:12.778]  By getting the different managers at the Baja Beach Clubs around Europe and now at the Big Miami Club there in Miami, to then become distributors, to be paid money by Applied Digital Solutions to be vendors, and then they say it's VIP, so that's kind of like saying, oh hitting yourself in the head with a ball-peen hammer is VIP, or
[01:39:13.863 --> 01:39:15.945]  Jumping off a cliff is VIP.
[01:39:16.305 --> 01:39:22.490]  To me, there's nothing more uncool than doing what the PR idiots say is cool.
[01:39:22.850 --> 01:39:32.618]  And I'm just telling you, Bubba, I think you're a victim of a Pentagon PR program, and I think you're being used to go out here and make this look grassroots and trendy.
[01:39:32.998 --> 01:39:39.102]  And I'm here to tell you that this is an admitted industry system-wide takeover, which you even admit.
[01:39:39.622 --> 01:39:41.944]  You said, you know, that's what the establishment always wants.
[01:39:42.284 --> 01:39:50.089]  So now I'm asking you, looking at this, are you reconsidering your lavish worldview, your glowing worldview of RFID?
[01:39:51.750 --> 01:39:59.015]  Well, I didn't really have to reconsider because as soon as I started learning some of the issues around it, I didn't really have a
[01:39:59.719 --> 01:40:00.960]  A glowing worldview.
[01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:06.024]  I mean, obviously, of all the interviews... Well, RFID toys, I mean, that sounds fun.
[01:40:06.084 --> 01:40:07.044]  It's friendly.
[01:40:07.785 --> 01:40:08.045]  Sure.
[01:40:08.565 --> 01:40:12.168]  I mean, if you want to experiment with it, and I mean, that's what the context of the book is.
[01:40:12.208 --> 01:40:13.689]  You want to play around with it.
[01:40:13.769 --> 01:40:14.970]  Not implants, per se.
[01:40:14.990 --> 01:40:18.152]  I mean, there's only, like, one page that mentions them briefly.
[01:40:18.532 --> 01:40:20.974]  But, you know, access cards, everything.
[01:40:20.994 --> 01:40:23.296]  You know, the things that people use on a daily basis already.
[01:40:23.935 --> 01:40:42.807]  Um, you know, if you want to understand the technology and, you know, come to, you know, know how it works so that, you know, you know, let's say someday in the future where this technology might be, you know, actually forced on the people, people that understand it are going to be the people, you know, fighting the technical, you know, fight against it.
[01:40:43.174 --> 01:40:46.377]  Because, you know, people that don't understand how it works, they're not going to be of any use.
[01:40:46.517 --> 01:40:48.759]  Well, let me tell you what the federal government did last year.
[01:40:48.779 --> 01:40:51.341]  They passed a law in the name of fighting terrorism.
[01:40:51.641 --> 01:40:53.103]  Everything's for terrorism now.
[01:40:53.123 --> 01:40:53.883]  Yeah.
[01:40:54.224 --> 01:41:00.089]  They passed a law, and they said that all livestock in the country has to be RFID tagged.
[01:41:00.409 --> 01:41:08.136]  When you take your horse and trailer it, take it to a place to go ride it, you've got to call the government and let them know you're going to be traveling with your horse.
[01:41:09.136 --> 01:41:13.317]  Everything from pigeons to cats to dogs, they want to be microchips.
[01:41:13.337 --> 01:41:20.559]  So again, then they register you in the program and satellite surveil, that's Associated Press, your farm and ranch.
[01:41:20.839 --> 01:41:24.100]  This is total big brother and has nothing to do with terrorism.
[01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:28.161]  And see right there, out of the gates, they're going to force us into this.
[01:41:28.201 --> 01:41:28.981]  This is hellish.
[01:41:30.927 --> 01:41:34.309]  I'm wondering about the trackability of it.
[01:41:34.629 --> 01:41:39.131]  Do you know how they can link satellite to the chip itself?
[01:41:39.191 --> 01:41:39.451]  No, no, no.
[01:41:39.471 --> 01:41:57.718]  That's part of a system where you register with a state agency under federal guidelines and just part of the chipping and part of the government visits and part of the veterinarians being the enforcers is your farms registered, your wells registered, and satellites are watching you.
[01:41:58.723 --> 01:42:06.425]  Yeah, actually that's a good point because exactly why I didn't use Verichip and exactly why I didn't use the PET.
[01:42:07.105 --> 01:42:12.766]  And Verichip says they want to go to the point where it is satellite tracked, boosted and relayed by the cell towers.
[01:42:13.586 --> 01:42:24.188]  Yeah, I mean those reasons exactly are why I didn't want to use them because they do require registration and it's a more controlled thing and that was totally not an option for me.
[01:42:26.061 --> 01:42:29.963]  All this is part of what I'm actually speaking about in Seattle.
[01:42:30.763 --> 01:42:33.484]  People want to know about the security and privacy issues around it.
[01:42:34.064 --> 01:42:38.585]  So that's part of what I'm trying to... Tell us about your upcoming speaking engagement.
[01:42:38.625 --> 01:42:44.427]  By the way, the website is RFIDtoys.net.
[01:42:44.867 --> 01:42:47.248]  You can go visit it by going to InfoWars.com.
[01:42:47.268 --> 01:42:47.928]  We have a link to it.
[01:42:48.048 --> 01:42:50.349]  Tell us about your speaking engagement that's upcoming.
[01:42:51.092 --> 01:43:10.187]  Well, it's just basically covering RFID in general, and then diving into more of the security and privacy issues around it, specifically around implants, particularly the Verichip and things like that, that people are using to get into these high security areas and make payments with.
[01:43:10.687 --> 01:43:12.829]  But in reality, I mean, it's been proven
[01:43:13.493 --> 01:43:19.177]  By several people that the IDs can be, you know, sniffed off of somebody.
[01:43:19.237 --> 01:43:22.699]  It's unbelievably unsecure and it's designed that way.
[01:43:22.779 --> 01:43:37.128]  Listen, most of the identity fraud is by governmental sales of data dumps to private groups and most identity fraud is not where people think it is on the internet or when you buy something at the store.
[01:43:37.508 --> 01:43:42.311]  The government wants more identity theft problems and they can bring in even more draconian controls.
[01:43:43.048 --> 01:43:46.483]  Yeah, I mean I buy things on the internet all the time and I've never had an issue.
[01:43:47.508 --> 01:43:56.275]  You know, I buy like 90% of my stuff through, you know, credit card use on the internet and I've not had a problem, so... Well, I'm all... I'm all grafter.
[01:43:56.355 --> 01:43:57.456]  Let's take a couple calls.
[01:43:57.496 --> 01:44:01.460]  I appreciate you joining us and you're a little bit better than I thought you were earlier.
[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:05.202]  I mean, I really appreciate you seeing... seeing the serious problems of this.
[01:44:05.883 --> 01:44:09.066]  Let's talk to Dan in Arkansas, then to Emmett and others.
[01:44:09.086 --> 01:44:11.628]  Well, I tell you what, that's... that's one of the phone banks.
[01:44:12.568 --> 01:44:13.569]  Who's up first here?
[01:44:13.989 --> 01:44:14.550]  I'm confused.
[01:44:15.387 --> 01:44:17.169]  Joe and Matt, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:44:17.389 --> 01:44:19.410]  Alex, yeah, give him a chance.
[01:44:19.631 --> 01:44:20.651]  You think he means well.
[01:44:21.192 --> 01:44:21.973]  Amal, is that true?
[01:44:21.993 --> 01:44:27.497]  You don't believe that this should be used to control people because they're going to have it so that you have to touch a computer, get your fingerprint.
[01:44:27.517 --> 01:44:29.639]  I mean, I see the point around the security.
[01:44:29.659 --> 01:44:33.142]  Yeah, the new Microsoft operating system is designed where you're going to have to do this.
[01:44:34.243 --> 01:44:37.045]  Well, I think it should be up to the individual.
[01:44:37.105 --> 01:44:38.686]  What's your take on this, Amal?
[01:44:38.706 --> 01:44:41.749]  Do you think it should be up to the individual or do you think it should be forced into everybody?
[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:45.062]  I definitely think it's up to the individual.
[01:44:46.422 --> 01:44:47.703]  Even down to my girlfriend.
[01:44:47.743 --> 01:44:53.847]  I asked her over and over if she was sure she wanted to do it.
[01:44:53.967 --> 01:44:57.189]  I made sure she was giving me the reasons why.
[01:44:58.529 --> 01:45:02.092]  If she just wanted to do it because she thought it was cool, I'd be like, well it's not worth it.
[01:45:02.552 --> 01:45:03.112]  Don't bother.
[01:45:03.392 --> 01:45:04.193]  Can you remove it?
[01:45:04.233 --> 01:45:06.094]  Can you have it removed if you want to remove it?
[01:45:06.681 --> 01:45:08.682]  Well, there's two kinds of chips, actually.
[01:45:08.722 --> 01:45:17.105]  The Vera chip is one of the kinds that has a biobond coating on it, and it lets your flesh grow into it a little bit to secure it so it doesn't move around.
[01:45:17.605 --> 01:45:20.186]  Those kind of chips are difficult to remove.
[01:45:20.686 --> 01:45:29.490]  The chips that I have and the chips that other people that are kind of the do-it-yourselfers, we all make sure to not get that kind so that removal is a very simple process.
[01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:32.571]  It's just a little cut with a scalpel and pop it out.
[01:45:33.221 --> 01:45:38.885]  I see the reason for medical, if you can't speak to a doctor, but that should be up to the individual.
[01:45:40.046 --> 01:45:43.809]  I think in medical cases, don't you, I think it could be useful.
[01:45:43.989 --> 01:45:45.510]  What's your take on that, Alex?
[01:45:45.670 --> 01:45:51.034]  Well, you can have the same code, you know, via a tattoo on your rear end.
[01:45:51.114 --> 01:45:56.698]  I just think, and then that, you know, eight-digit code is in there, they have your whole medical history.
[01:45:57.879 --> 01:46:00.020]  Listen, bad people developed this.
[01:46:00.141 --> 01:46:04.883]  They have a horrible reason for wanting to push it as a track and control grid.
[01:46:05.024 --> 01:46:10.687]  The Pentagon says they're going to try to force us to take it using security clearances and trendiness.
[01:46:11.067 --> 01:46:12.328]  It's now happening.
[01:46:12.628 --> 01:46:13.649]  We're watching it.
[01:46:13.709 --> 01:46:15.770]  We're looking at the aftermath of it.
[01:46:16.110 --> 01:46:17.131]  It's ongoing.
[01:46:17.171 --> 01:46:21.614]  We've got to stop the implementation of this technology.
[01:46:22.975 --> 01:46:38.048]  My question is, if someone does want to have it for medical reasons, just for medical reasons, if you're found and you don't have a Medicare bracelet or something,
[01:46:38.753 --> 01:46:43.675]  How can this be done to safeguard against, if you only use what it's supposed to be, that's all I'm saying.
[01:46:44.135 --> 01:46:49.236]  We've got to stop widespread acceptance of tracker chips in the human body.
[01:46:49.256 --> 01:46:50.456]  There are other ways to do it.
[01:46:50.897 --> 01:46:56.358]  Necklaces, bracelets, tattoos, cards, there are so many things.
[01:46:56.398 --> 01:47:02.320]  In other words, have like a thing you can carry, it'd be a chip, it'd be on a necklace, and your medical history would be in that, you mean, something like that.
[01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:05.603]  But, I mean, even that's, you know, the world isn't perfect.
[01:47:05.623 --> 01:47:06.964]  We've gotten along in the past.
[01:47:07.165 --> 01:47:10.528]  The point is, is that the bad of this outweighs the good.
[01:47:10.548 --> 01:47:11.429]  Thanks for the call.
[01:47:11.449 --> 01:47:18.616]  I mean, I don't really know how I... The Pentagon said that they were going to promote this as something trendy and sell us on it.
[01:47:19.416 --> 01:47:20.598]  Joe in Missouri.
[01:47:20.618 --> 01:47:21.498]  You're on the air, Joe.
[01:47:21.538 --> 01:47:22.780]  Go ahead with our guest.
[01:47:23.821 --> 01:47:25.002]  Yes, sir.
[01:47:25.788 --> 01:47:28.669]  Just one point that's really important to get across.
[01:47:28.809 --> 01:47:30.450]  It's not just RFID.
[01:47:31.230 --> 01:47:32.431]  It's a leash.
[01:47:32.651 --> 01:47:41.635]  The same as a dog collar leash with electronic control where the dog goes to the edge of the grass and he gets a spike in the neck and he goes back and stays on the lot.
[01:47:42.555 --> 01:47:43.355]  It is a leash.
[01:47:43.515 --> 01:47:45.056]  It is nothing but a leash.
[01:47:45.476 --> 01:47:54.200]  If you try and go past their sensors, they can put a cell phone on you and give you a spike and a shock so you stay out of their area.
[01:47:54.824 --> 01:48:03.106]  Well, not with these particular chips, but no, they're talking about future chips, for prisoners and others, doing exactly that.
[01:48:03.666 --> 01:48:12.268]  And you know, at first it'll be for the child molester, and we'll all be, yeah, that's good, they're scum, but next it'll be for DWIs, and next for not paying your tickets.
[01:48:12.328 --> 01:48:15.808]  This type of braceleting is already happening.
[01:48:15.848 --> 01:48:17.669]  Again, the government can't be trusted.
[01:48:18.029 --> 01:48:23.790]  They commit more crimes statistically than any other group, and it's just out of control.
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:26.661]  Okay, Alex, that's the one point.
[01:48:26.761 --> 01:48:27.382]  It's a leash.
[01:48:27.522 --> 01:48:28.843]  It's not just RFID.
[01:48:29.143 --> 01:48:30.224]  Well, that's where it's all going.
[01:48:30.284 --> 01:48:31.785]  It certainly is a tracking leash.
[01:48:32.225 --> 01:48:42.351]  Look, we just beat bills that would have gone into law this year for tracker chips and all our inspection stickers to track, trace, and tax us and give us tickets on Texas roads, Amal.
[01:48:43.252 --> 01:48:50.617]  Yeah, that's actually a huge thing that I mention a little bit in the book about the use of the abuses of RFID.
[01:48:51.617 --> 01:48:53.879]  The toll payment systems that go into cars
[01:48:54.797 --> 01:48:58.859]  And the people accept those in their cars under the premise that they're being used for payment.
[01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:08.485]  But now, they're expanding the use of those RFID devices against the, you know, the consent of the people who have them in their cars.
[01:49:08.745 --> 01:49:13.487]  It's a poor technology for security and for the public.
[01:49:13.547 --> 01:49:16.909]  It's a great technology for tracking everything because it's cheap.
[01:49:16.929 --> 01:49:20.231]  I mean, they've got these down to two cents a piece little Hitachi chips.
[01:49:21.152 --> 01:49:21.692]  Yeah, totally.
[01:49:22.572 --> 01:49:23.793]  So, I mean, we've got to kill it.
[01:49:23.813 --> 01:49:24.693]  We've got to stop it.
[01:49:25.473 --> 01:49:29.555]  I mean, there might be some applications just in a few areas.
[01:49:29.635 --> 01:49:31.296]  It's just not that good of a technology.
[01:49:31.836 --> 01:49:33.677]  Let's talk to Jane in Maryland.
[01:49:33.737 --> 01:49:34.517]  Jane, go ahead.
[01:49:34.778 --> 01:49:35.698]  Yeah, that alright.
[01:49:35.718 --> 01:49:37.859]  By the way, how deeply embedded in your skin is this?
[01:49:38.979 --> 01:49:39.960]  It's just undoskin.
[01:49:40.020 --> 01:49:43.221]  I can bite it out in an emergency if I need to.
[01:49:43.361 --> 01:49:51.245]  Right, and you're aware, of course, of the possibility of migration, infection, various other medical... Yeah, MRIs cause them to explode.
[01:49:52.263 --> 01:49:54.705]  Yeah, MRIs are an issue.
[01:49:55.165 --> 01:49:58.988]  Infections are an issue during the healing process, but after that it's not a problem.
[01:50:00.089 --> 01:50:06.153]  Migration is generally an issue if it's in muscle tissue, but just being under the skin, I mean, it's not a very big danger.
[01:50:06.853 --> 01:50:07.073]  Right.
[01:50:07.133 --> 01:50:09.815]  Several technical aspects of this I thought should be pointed out.
[01:50:10.015 --> 01:50:14.398]  One, it is a transponder, which is to say it's emitting a signal, a unique signal.
[01:50:14.718 --> 01:50:18.241]  That signal can be amplified and boosted, so it definitely is a tracking device.
[01:50:19.001 --> 01:50:23.245]  Oh no, Applied Digital says we're all going to be forced to take them.
[01:50:23.705 --> 01:50:26.727]  I've had their doctors and their CEO and their distributors on.
[01:50:27.228 --> 01:50:31.371]  They have little slogans like, you will get chipped, submit, the chip will prevail.
[01:50:32.892 --> 01:50:38.096]  And then you've got well-meaning people, like our guest, who just, I guess, are starting to wake up.
[01:50:38.931 --> 01:50:44.996]  So it's interesting that he got the chip out of trendiness, or just because it was interesting, and now he's become educated on it.
[01:50:45.016 --> 01:50:46.517]  So, stay there, Jane.
[01:50:46.537 --> 01:50:49.800]  Let's do one more segment with our guests, and we'll take more calls.
[01:50:50.961 --> 01:50:53.803]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:50:54.064 --> 01:50:55.645]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:50:55.985 --> 01:51:00.629]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[01:51:00.989 --> 01:51:07.715]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:51:08.035 --> 01:51:10.016]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:51:10.236 --> 01:51:13.078]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:51:13.158 --> 01:51:17.821]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:51:18.041 --> 01:51:22.404]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:51:22.684 --> 01:51:29.908]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:51:30.148 --> 01:51:32.590]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[01:51:32.730 --> 01:51:34.451]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[01:51:35.051 --> 01:51:40.597]  Call 1-888-253-3139 or visit InfoWars.com and the secure shopping cart.
[01:51:40.697 --> 01:51:41.618]  That's InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:51:41.798 --> 01:51:44.040]  Or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:51:51.434 --> 01:52:02.688]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[01:52:02.909 --> 01:52:09.377]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[01:52:09.597 --> 01:52:10.878]  to below detectable levels.
[01:52:11.158 --> 01:52:15.101]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[01:52:15.321 --> 01:52:21.847]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:52:22.067 --> 01:52:27.551]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[01:52:27.791 --> 01:52:34.714]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[01:52:34.934 --> 01:52:40.196]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:52:46.918 --> 01:52:48.239]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:52:49.259 --> 01:52:51.040]  Call 1-800-GOT-JUNK.
[01:52:51.300 --> 01:52:57.062]  They'll haul away all that junk you need to make go away from your garage, storage, attic, job site,
[01:52:57.535 --> 01:52:59.516]  Old office, home, or apartment?
[01:53:00.096 --> 01:53:03.558]  That's 1-800-GOT-J-U-N-K.
[01:53:04.859 --> 01:53:07.341]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[01:53:07.801 --> 01:53:09.702]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[01:53:10.442 --> 01:53:13.584]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[01:53:14.244 --> 01:53:20.628]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[01:53:21.482 --> 01:53:24.503]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[01:53:24.663 --> 01:53:26.243]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:53:26.944 --> 01:53:29.304]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:53:31.405 --> 01:53:34.306]  Spring cleaning?
[01:53:34.726 --> 01:53:36.186]  Call 1-800-GOT-JUNK.
[01:53:36.807 --> 01:53:44.009]  They'll haul away that unwanted stuff from your garage, storage shed, attic, job site, office, home, or apartment.
[01:53:44.589 --> 01:53:45.109]  Call today.
[01:53:45.249 --> 01:53:45.689]  Call 1-800-GOT-JUNK.
[01:53:51.315 --> 01:54:01.924]  I want to jam in a few final calls for our guest.
[01:54:02.885 --> 01:54:05.147]  Jane and Marilyn, go ahead and finish up your comments.
[01:54:06.007 --> 01:54:10.531]  Understand that this thing can be scanned just as a credit card magnetic strip can be scanned.
[01:54:10.831 --> 01:54:12.953]  Hence, it can be forged and emulated.
[01:54:13.013 --> 01:54:15.856]  So dude, you haven't really bought yourself any kind of security.
[01:54:15.876 --> 01:54:17.517]  They don't need to cut your hand off.
[01:54:17.901 --> 01:54:19.142]  All they've got to do is scan it.
[01:54:19.542 --> 01:54:23.425]  Now, I first read about these things in the 70s when they were using them to track cattle.
[01:54:23.805 --> 01:54:28.408]  And it strikes me that, in effect, when you get one of these things implanted in you, you become human cattle.
[01:54:28.729 --> 01:54:31.891]  And my friend, at some point, they're going to cull the herd.
[01:54:32.431 --> 01:54:34.893]  And you might just be one of those cattle that gets culled.
[01:54:35.273 --> 01:54:35.893]  I wish you luck.
[01:54:36.494 --> 01:54:37.274]  All right, Jane.
[01:54:37.314 --> 01:54:38.315]  Thank you for the call.
[01:54:38.475 --> 01:54:39.336]  Comments on that, sir?
[01:54:41.018 --> 01:54:42.559]  Well, I mean, that's part of the issue.
[01:54:42.619 --> 01:54:47.641]  I mean, security has been one of the things that's kind of paramount and discussed in the book.
[01:54:48.201 --> 01:54:49.982]  And, you know, it is a problem.
[01:54:50.522 --> 01:55:03.088]  You know, on the other hand, what I see, you know, is if somebody's going to sneak up on me in a personal use situation, you know, and steal the ID and try to get it in my house, I mean, it's not going to work on an extra neighbor's house.
[01:55:03.770 --> 01:55:06.892]  Um, you know, they're going to take an easier route.
[01:55:07.032 --> 01:55:10.873]  If they want in my house, they're going to break the window, or they're going to kick the door in, or pick the lock.
[01:55:11.214 --> 01:55:20.378]  I mean, while it is possible, in a personal use, low security, low risk, non-payment type system, I accept those security risks.
[01:55:20.618 --> 01:55:23.299]  And if it were ever to become oppressive, I would get it removed.
[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:26.981]  Alright, let's talk to Cliff in Utah.
[01:55:27.041 --> 01:55:28.702]  Cliff, quickly, you're on the air with our guest.
[01:55:29.582 --> 01:55:30.563]  How you doing Alex?
[01:55:30.583 --> 01:55:35.209]  Yeah, you gotta think one thing too is that they work both ends from the middle.
[01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:40.396]  Now if you have the chip and you take it out and your pet has one, they still have you tracked right there.
[01:55:41.197 --> 01:55:46.163]  And if you go to chips forward slash GPS, you'll find out that they can track anywhere.
[01:55:47.041 --> 01:55:49.863]  Well, they're already using telephones to do it.
[01:55:49.923 --> 01:55:53.485]  First it was, uh, oh, you know, GPS for your safety.
[01:55:53.586 --> 01:55:55.127]  Oh, now we're tracking it for traffic.
[01:55:55.167 --> 01:55:56.668]  And, oh, for law enforcement.
[01:55:56.888 --> 01:55:58.089]  We're tracking all of you.
[01:55:58.329 --> 01:55:59.650]  Well, what happened to the Fourth Amendment?
[01:55:59.670 --> 01:56:01.471]  They're busy talking about NSA spying.
[01:56:01.711 --> 01:56:02.712]  What about our cell phones?
[01:56:02.732 --> 01:56:04.012]  They're doing it right out in the open.
[01:56:04.213 --> 01:56:05.153]  That's exactly right.
[01:56:05.193 --> 01:56:08.635]  And something, too, before you couldn't even talk up in an airplane over 2,600 feet.
[01:56:08.856 --> 01:56:11.878]  And they've had that problem solved now, too.
[01:56:12.358 --> 01:56:13.699]  You know, in fact, it's been proven.
[01:56:14.992 --> 01:56:16.453]  Yeah, it didn't work on 9-11.
[01:56:16.773 --> 01:56:22.636]  You couldn't make phone calls above about 3,000 feet, but magically it worked that day with those special phone calls.
[01:56:23.056 --> 01:56:25.718]  All right, I want to thank our guests for joining us.
[01:56:25.758 --> 01:56:27.558]  I guess we've got time for Fred in Philadelphia.
[01:56:27.839 --> 01:56:31.000]  Fred, you're on the air with our guest, the author of RFID Toys.
[01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:32.701]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Fred.
[01:56:32.841 --> 01:56:35.883]  He didn't even answer your question about where this is going.
[01:56:35.943 --> 01:56:42.286]  He said there are two groups of people, the social aesthetics and the techies.
[01:56:43.145 --> 01:57:02.694]  I am so sick of this gentleman because the biggest question that you have on the show is where is this going and the fact is that everyone is against it until you can distract them with these technical dazzles and apologetic answers.
[01:57:04.515 --> 01:57:06.736]  It really is unnatural and it's against
[01:57:08.607 --> 01:57:12.908]  It's against all our values, it's against all our laws, it's against the right of privacy.
[01:57:14.549 --> 01:57:18.330]  I know it's being driven by a criminal government out of control.
[01:57:18.830 --> 01:57:19.551]  Thank you for the call.
[01:57:19.671 --> 01:57:22.392]  Final comments, Mr. Grastro.
[01:57:24.332 --> 01:57:35.536]  I guess final comments are, you know, I ventured into this as a personal venture, not because I saw someone else do it and thought it was cool.
[01:57:37.722 --> 01:57:46.425]  I'll probably pursue it as a personal venture and then exit the technology arena in RFID in the same manner.
[01:57:47.765 --> 01:57:58.069]  At this point, I don't see any direct security or privacy issues against me individually.
[01:57:58.089 --> 01:58:00.149]  The day is coming.
[01:58:00.429 --> 01:58:01.350]  I can see that.
[01:58:02.609 --> 01:58:03.289]  All right.
[01:58:03.489 --> 01:58:15.573]  Well, sir, I hope that you'll be a critic against the Big Brother aspects, which are the dominant aspects of this emerging technology that's being rammed down our throat with billions of dollars behind it, peddling it and pushing it.
[01:58:15.633 --> 01:58:16.533]  It's very sinister.
[01:58:16.553 --> 01:58:21.655]  And we have links on Infowars.com to photos of your chip and you being chipped and a lot more.
[01:58:21.935 --> 01:58:24.036]  Thanks for spending 55 minutes with us.
[01:58:24.696 --> 01:58:24.916]  Thank you.
[01:58:25.336 --> 01:58:25.616]  You bet.
[01:58:25.916 --> 01:58:26.977]  Third hour, a ton of news.
[01:58:26.997 --> 01:58:27.877]  Your call straight ahead.
[01:58:29.818 --> 01:58:34.709]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:58:40.037 --> 01:58:46.261]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:58:46.421 --> 01:58:52.585]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:58:52.865 --> 01:59:01.310]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:59:01.551 --> 01:59:08.555]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:59:08.875 --> 01:59:13.678]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:59:13.898 --> 01:59:19.302]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:59:19.642 --> 01:59:22.684]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:59:23.055 --> 01:59:30.959]  Get the Illuminated Berkey Bass for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:59:31.059 --> 01:59:31.619]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:59:45.016 --> 01:59:45.656]  Big Brother.
[01:59:46.316 --> 01:59:47.397]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:48.097 --> 01:59:49.838]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:49.858 --> 01:59:50.658]  You want answers?
[01:59:51.438 --> 01:59:52.399]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:52.979 --> 01:59:56.600]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:57.181 --> 02:00:01.302]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:10.726 --> 02:00:16.955]  Well, the last hour we had one of these individuals on who's taken the microchip and written a book about it.
[02:00:17.035 --> 02:00:18.117]  No, it's so cool.
[02:00:18.197 --> 02:00:20.180]  And he really talked himself into...
[02:00:21.847 --> 02:00:25.888]  Into a conundrum, and I think obviously common sense took the field.
[02:00:25.908 --> 02:00:32.710]  We're going to have open phones in this third hour on any issue you want to discuss, but I warn you, I'm going to move the callers quickly.
[02:00:32.750 --> 02:00:34.131]  We've already taken a lot of calls today.
[02:00:34.171 --> 02:00:38.832]  I'm proud of that fact that I'm not procrastinating, and we're going to take a lot more in this hour.
[02:00:39.232 --> 02:00:45.774]  Any news issue, any news item, any question, any comment, anything you want to talk about, toll free number 1-800-259-9231.
[02:00:49.735 --> 02:00:58.440]  1-800-259-9231 and we will get you up and on the air today.
[02:00:59.101 --> 02:01:10.568]  I would like to give callers a take on what's happening with the Associated Press, I guess because it didn't scare people enough, just coming out again.
[02:01:12.089 --> 02:01:30.180]  And reporting that Bin Laden had said, I want a truce and you'll never catch me alive, quote, when that newest fake tape was released a month ago, they just recycled the same news story like it was new to keep the fear up.
[02:01:30.220 --> 02:01:34.543]  And we know they've issued a lot of fake terror alerts in the past, and it's very, very upsetting.
[02:01:35.324 --> 02:01:36.804]  That and a bunch of other news is coming up.
[02:01:36.844 --> 02:01:39.246]  Right now, let's go to Eddie in England, who's been holding patiently.
[02:01:39.606 --> 02:01:40.367]  Eddie, you're on the air.
[02:01:40.407 --> 02:01:40.787]  Go ahead.
[02:01:41.730 --> 02:01:42.530]  Hello, Alec.
[02:01:43.190 --> 02:01:58.473]  I just wondered if you were aware of the evidence being presented at The Hague and the prosecution of Vladimir Milošević by Miss Anne Prentiss.
[02:02:00.334 --> 02:02:01.214]  She's a journalist.
[02:02:02.474 --> 02:02:03.835]  She was there in 1994.
[02:02:04.735 --> 02:02:10.676]  And she, in the evidence, said that she was in Isabella Vick's foyer
[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:15.081]  When Bin Laden was escorted in to see him.
[02:02:16.141 --> 02:02:21.602]  Another journalist was from Der Spiegel, but the name of him I can't find out.
[02:02:22.902 --> 02:02:28.884]  And the reaction of the judge towards this was, well, quite exceptional.
[02:02:29.444 --> 02:02:33.525]  He stopped the questioning, said it was irrelevant, and I had to be struck out.
[02:02:34.085 --> 02:02:35.625]  Now, where did you read this?
[02:02:36.916 --> 02:02:38.317]  I picked it up off the internet.
[02:02:38.597 --> 02:02:39.538]  I sent you an email.
[02:02:39.598 --> 02:02:42.019]  I don't remember... Okay, I mean, I understand off the internet.
[02:02:42.039 --> 02:02:43.200]  It wasn't in a newspaper.
[02:02:44.561 --> 02:02:50.024]  No, this was off of the internet, written by... Oh, I can't remember.
[02:02:51.124 --> 02:02:54.286]  Well, I can't really comment on it if I don't know that it's from a source.
[02:02:54.326 --> 02:02:57.148]  Yeah, it was written by Andy Wilcoxon.
[02:02:57.588 --> 02:02:59.669]  He's worked on many newspapers.
[02:02:59.709 --> 02:03:00.890]  The Guardian, I think, as well.
[02:03:00.930 --> 02:03:04.012]  Sure, well then, what email address did you send that to?
[02:03:05.113 --> 02:03:08.454]  I sent it directly to you off of Prison Planet.
[02:03:09.395 --> 02:03:09.895]  Okay.
[02:03:09.955 --> 02:03:14.697]  I sent it to you yesterday, but I didn't know where it got through because my email has gone down today.
[02:03:14.717 --> 02:03:17.918]  I still don't know what email address that is.
[02:03:19.158 --> 02:03:21.099]  You said you sent me an email through Prison Planet.
[02:03:21.219 --> 02:03:23.280]  Yeah, it says contact Alex.
[02:03:23.420 --> 02:03:25.101]  Oh, so you sent it to Paul Watson, yeah.
[02:03:25.621 --> 02:03:26.681]  Oh, I've sent it to Paul Watson.
[02:03:26.741 --> 02:03:28.662]  I also see those, but yes.
[02:03:28.902 --> 02:03:30.343]  But that's a good email to send stuff to.
[02:03:32.598 --> 02:03:35.620]  Now, he's saying that Bin Laden met with Slobodan Milošević?
[02:03:36.721 --> 02:03:37.621]  No, no.
[02:03:38.342 --> 02:03:43.405]  She says that she was waiting to have an interview with Igor Veselich.
[02:03:43.765 --> 02:03:45.646]  It was very difficult to pronounce his name.
[02:03:46.086 --> 02:03:48.648]  And to show my ignorance, I'm not placing that name at this time.
[02:03:49.168 --> 02:03:53.491]  Well, I think he took over after Slobodan Milošević.
[02:03:54.543 --> 02:03:56.144]  Well, that would make sense, sure.
[02:03:57.144 --> 02:03:58.525]  Now the name rings a bell.
[02:03:58.865 --> 02:04:04.588]  Look, we know Bin Laden's CIA, it's admitted, a congressional report by Republicans in 99.
[02:04:05.028 --> 02:04:14.452]  We know that he was there in Albania helping launch the attacks, as the good CIA boy he's always been, against Slobo, and that's publicly admitted.
[02:04:14.472 --> 02:04:16.894]  And then when Slobo fought back, he was an evil terrorist.
[02:04:17.514 --> 02:04:20.755]  There's something else, Alex, if I may.
[02:04:20.995 --> 02:04:21.836]  Go ahead and fire it up.
[02:04:22.526 --> 02:04:31.494]  Um, I've just heard now that David Irvin, the historian that's been in jail in Austria for denying... Yes, what happened to him?
[02:04:32.355 --> 02:04:34.557]  They've given him three years in jail, would you believe?
[02:04:34.958 --> 02:04:35.498]  Outrageous.
[02:04:35.518 --> 02:04:36.119]  I'll check it out.
[02:04:36.159 --> 02:04:36.859]  Thanks for the call.
[02:04:36.879 --> 02:04:37.880]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:37.920 --> 02:04:38.441]  Stay with us.
[02:04:41.958 --> 02:04:44.119]  Ever wish your kid came with an instruction manual?

[02:05:12.096 --> 02:05:19.001]  When my son started having behavior problems, the Total Transformation techniques were like the instruction manual on how to deal with him.
[02:05:19.241 --> 02:05:20.522]  We got immediate results.
[02:05:21.022 --> 02:05:23.146]  Do you need an instruction manual for your kid?

[02:07:38.985 --> 02:07:47.793]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:07:47.813 --> 02:07:51.396]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:10.735 --> 02:08:16.198]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we're now 8 minutes 30 seconds into this third and final hour today.
[02:08:16.218 --> 02:08:18.699]  And I can't just blaze over this.
[02:08:18.819 --> 02:08:21.001]  I can't not spend time on it.
[02:08:21.021 --> 02:08:23.082]  I'm working on a new documentary
[02:08:23.971 --> 02:08:35.013]  And instead of getting into 9-11, we look at the literally hundreds and hundreds, but we'll look at some of those, examples of the U.S.
[02:08:35.234 --> 02:08:44.996]  government, that is the criminal corporate elements that control it, carrying out terror attacks to blame it on their political enemies.
[02:08:47.020 --> 02:08:56.228]  I knew that Operation Gladio was carried out by the US, British, Spanish, German, and of course Italian governments.
[02:08:56.668 --> 02:08:58.669]  It was actually in over 20 countries I've now learned.
[02:08:59.250 --> 02:09:07.156]  But I didn't know that... I knew it was in declassified documents, and I knew that it was in the Library of Congress, the National Security Archive.
[02:09:07.757 --> 02:09:11.720]  But I didn't know that it's all over the CIA's website.
[02:09:12.555 --> 02:09:14.977]  I mean, they brag about Blatio.
[02:09:15.558 --> 02:09:17.760]  They brag about the NATO option.
[02:09:17.860 --> 02:09:25.548]  And then, I found a whole section bragging about Mozadek, how our government carried out terror attacks.
[02:09:26.221 --> 02:09:36.872]  And blamed it on Mosedec to bring out a pro-western, anti-communist, pro-national government with a man who, again, was Time Magazine Man of the Year.
[02:09:36.892 --> 02:09:38.674]  He really did care about the people.
[02:09:39.175 --> 02:09:47.704]  He abolished the old peerage system where the Peacock Throne issued all the little lordships over the different fiefdoms.
[02:09:49.466 --> 02:09:59.429]  He did so many things, and he just wanted to keep a little bit of the Iranians' oil for the Iranian people, and BP said, no, British Petroleum, you're going to give it all to us.
[02:09:59.609 --> 02:10:12.893]  And to not just hear Kermit Roosevelt on the radio a few years ago bragging about how he carried out terror attacks as Middle East Section Chief, along with Norman Schwarzkopf's father, by the way, but to then
[02:10:13.813 --> 02:10:19.776]  Go to, to type it into Google and to be on the CIA's website where they're bragging about it.
[02:10:21.417 --> 02:10:27.900]  Understand, and I know I talked about this in the first hour for a few minutes, but I'd like to hear callers maybe mention this today or give me your take on it.
[02:10:29.160 --> 02:10:34.563]  Understand, we're all debating 9-11, which was clearly, patently an inside job, but to
[02:10:35.891 --> 02:10:43.058]  I even learned that our own government admits that hundreds of terror attacks, because Gladio, I kept saying was over 130.
[02:10:43.538 --> 02:10:44.959]  That's what I've seen in documents.
[02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:46.981]  That was just operations in Europe.
[02:10:47.021 --> 02:10:48.723]  Gladio was all over Latin America.
[02:10:49.003 --> 02:10:50.845]  It's in the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.
[02:10:51.365 --> 02:10:54.648]  Army field manuals, all of it, for hours last night.
[02:10:55.108 --> 02:11:01.094]  I did five hours of research just to make sure my voiceover, five minutes of voiceover, five hours of research,
[02:11:01.969 --> 02:11:09.734]  Just to make sure, just to have footnotes, just to triple-check every fact I was going to claim and every document I was going to put in this new film.
[02:11:10.195 --> 02:11:14.197]  And there were so many other examples of it.
[02:11:14.657 --> 02:11:18.960]  I mean, there are still people that will debate the Gulf of Tonkin that got us into Vietnam as being staged.
[02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:22.983]  That is admittedly a government op, and that's now declassified.
[02:11:24.062 --> 02:11:35.434]  So, for anybody that has a doubt, and then some people, you know, I've had a bunch of big CIA guys on the last few months, and they'll go, well, it's true, we staged Gulf of Tonkin, and we staged the Mozadek thing, but we don't do that anymore.
[02:11:35.454 --> 02:11:37.676]  That was in the old swashbuckling days.
[02:11:38.216 --> 02:11:40.419]  Oh, no, you don't do the blow-up of school bus anymore.
[02:11:41.199 --> 02:11:51.125]  No, you just fly hijacked remote-controlled planes into buildings and you have big theatrical events and you're saying the next event is going to make that look like child's play.
[02:11:51.445 --> 02:11:53.646]  So we're on the edge of World War III, folks.
[02:11:53.706 --> 02:11:54.787]  They want it to go bad.
[02:11:54.987 --> 02:11:56.388]  They want it to enlarge.
[02:11:57.068 --> 02:11:59.950]  They want a police state here in America.
[02:12:00.590 --> 02:12:07.034]  America is more of a target of the neocons and their banker controllers than is Iran.
[02:12:07.114 --> 02:12:08.375]  They're just the diversion.
[02:12:09.537 --> 02:12:13.440]  And we're on the edge here, so for everybody listening, this is not my opinion.
[02:12:13.500 --> 02:12:21.465]  Go to the CIA, type in Mosedec CIA into their search engine, and read it at the Central Intelligence Agency.
[02:12:21.805 --> 02:12:23.907]  They're bragging about carrying out terror.
[02:12:24.227 --> 02:12:30.631]  And so if they've done it over and over and over and over again, why aren't they the first suspects when there's new terror attacks?
[02:12:30.951 --> 02:12:34.854]  And then we look at the new terror attacks and we catch them red-handed doing it.
[02:12:36.098 --> 02:12:41.463]  Now, I'm going to move really quick here, because I've got a bunch of other news I want to hit, and I want to take all your calls, so I'm going to give each caller about a minute and a half here.
[02:12:41.583 --> 02:12:42.984]  Alex in North Carolina, go ahead.
[02:12:43.465 --> 02:12:43.965]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:12:44.005 --> 02:12:49.090]  What do you think about RFID tags that are now supposedly in all of the automotive tires?
[02:12:49.230 --> 02:12:51.132]  I don't hear that mentioned too much on the show.
[02:12:51.152 --> 02:12:54.955]  Well, yeah, Michelin started three years ago, and now I heard it was in four major brands.
[02:12:54.995 --> 02:12:56.537]  I didn't know it was in all of them.
[02:12:57.017 --> 02:13:00.561]  Do you think that may be something they'll use in the future in addition to these?
[02:13:00.601 --> 02:13:01.582]  They said they are.
[02:13:01.943 --> 02:13:17.541]  The Michelin RFID is much bigger than it should be and they claim it gives them the entire history of the RFID, but these things are all designed open-ended where the scan readers already gone up nationwide as part of a quote defense department control grid, MIT magazine,
[02:13:17.981 --> 02:13:18.281]  Wow, nice.
[02:13:18.341 --> 02:13:21.303]  I guess it's going to be pretty hard to drive without tires in the future.
[02:13:36.525 --> 02:13:38.207]  Well, that's where it's all going, Bubba.
[02:13:38.408 --> 02:13:43.314]  And Industry Together is in a full court press with the Defense Department.
[02:13:43.694 --> 02:13:48.661]  Just USA Today, Walmart Defense Department, team up to enforce RFID.
[02:13:48.681 --> 02:13:50.423]  2003, USA Today, in one of my films.
[02:13:52.485 --> 02:13:55.447]  And why are they trying to force universal adoption?
[02:13:55.507 --> 02:13:56.747]  They have told us why.
[02:13:57.188 --> 02:14:09.714]  It will make every can of beer, every Campbell's soup can, every Gillette razor, every tire, every shirt, will have your name and ID number scanned onto it at the time of purchase, quote, for refunding.
[02:14:10.518 --> 02:14:10.838]  Thank you Alex.
[02:14:32.276 --> 02:14:33.997]  Thank you for the call, I really do appreciate it.
[02:14:34.277 --> 02:14:35.938]  John in Ohio, you're on the air.
[02:14:36.599 --> 02:14:48.206]  Yes, Alex, I just wanted to ask you secondarily about the community, a very invasive questionnaire in between the census and whether you can get away with not responding to that.
[02:14:48.226 --> 02:14:50.267]  But more importantly, the issue of Iran.
[02:14:50.847 --> 02:14:56.671]  I was reading on WSWS.org about how the people in this country, according to a Gallup poll,
[02:14:57.613 --> 02:15:07.939]  Well, 86% favor taking no action or using economic efforts towards Iran, despite all the propaganda that we're being swallowed up with.
[02:15:08.019 --> 02:15:12.362]  And if you consider this former CIA officer, Philip Giraldi,
[02:15:12.902 --> 02:15:20.530]  Who said that the Pentagon plans to attack Iran were drawn up, quote, to be employed in response to another 9-11 type terrorist attack on the United States.
[02:15:21.050 --> 02:15:23.092]  He said this in the American Conservative Magazine.
[02:15:23.533 --> 02:15:29.819]  And he said, as in the case of Iraq, the response is not at all conditional on Iran actually being involved in the act of terrorism.
[02:15:29.899 --> 02:15:33.543]  No, they know the general public will be angered and threatened and they'll just
[02:15:33.943 --> 02:15:35.844]  It's just like a matador with a red cape.
[02:15:35.924 --> 02:15:39.325]  It's the matador who actually carries out the terror attack, i.e.
[02:15:39.385 --> 02:15:44.427]  Western intelligence agencies, but then they simply hang out the red cape in front of us, the bull.
[02:15:44.807 --> 02:15:48.248]  Yeah, it's like some kind of a parallel universe, unless it's on Fox or CNN.
[02:15:49.348 --> 02:15:50.389]  You know, it's not real.
[02:15:50.429 --> 02:15:55.591]  This has got to be shouted from the rooftops that the CIA... Sir, it's now been confirmed.
[02:15:55.731 --> 02:16:02.414]  Bush does not deny the White House memo that makes Downing Street look tame, where they wanted to paint up American planes like U.N.
[02:16:02.454 --> 02:16:12.658]  aircraft, crash them, get them shot down, maybe even have drones is what we're now learning, and claim Saddam shot them down, or have a defector come out and claim he found WMDs.
[02:16:12.698 --> 02:16:13.778]  There's the smoking gun.
[02:16:14.118 --> 02:16:15.199]  Nothing happens to them.
[02:16:16.299 --> 02:16:17.820]  There's now an admitted
[02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:23.564]  High-level Republican memo, now four months old, where they say we need another terror attack.
[02:16:23.884 --> 02:16:25.345]  But forget that document.
[02:16:25.385 --> 02:16:45.039]  We have the September 20, 2000 PENAC document written by Dick Cheney, Rebuilding America's Defenses, where he says, and I quote, Saddam is not a threat, but he is a convenient pretext to secure the region's resources and as a new base of military operations to project into Iran and Syria.
[02:16:45.499 --> 02:16:49.300]  Yeah, they need another Pearl Harbor attack, and they made it happen, and here we go.
[02:16:49.320 --> 02:16:56.723]  Look, it's just like Hitler going into Austria, just like Hitler going into Czechoslovakia, just like Hitler going into Poland.
[02:16:57.103 --> 02:16:59.724]  It's just, oh, we've got to go into this country now, because they attacked us.
[02:16:59.744 --> 02:17:01.625]  We've got to go into that country now, because they attacked us.
[02:17:01.865 --> 02:17:03.746]  Oh, we've got to go into this country, because they attacked us.
[02:17:03.766 --> 02:17:07.387]  I think we've got to really wake people up about how catastrophic this will be.
[02:17:07.407 --> 02:17:12.129]  The Oxford Research Group said that there will be 10,000 people die just on the bombing on the
[02:17:12.549 --> 02:17:18.011]  They're saying they're going to attack their entire infrastructure.
[02:17:18.171 --> 02:17:21.233]  Anything that ever could be used in basic support.
[02:17:21.393 --> 02:17:22.994]  Power stations, you name it.
[02:17:23.394 --> 02:17:25.775]  They're now admitting 200 plus targets.
[02:17:26.075 --> 02:17:30.497]  They're telling Georgia, and folks I'm not talking about Georgia peaches.
[02:17:30.517 --> 02:17:32.998]  I'm talking about Georgia and the former Soviet Union.
[02:17:33.278 --> 02:17:37.920]  They've got a deal with them to now use that as a base to attack Iran.
[02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:51.166]  You know, Ray McGovern, the top CIA officer who has... The CIA's own assessment, the new assessment says 10 years, if they were left alone and given the 10,000 plus centrifuges they need, 10 years to build one A-bomb.
[02:17:51.326 --> 02:17:59.590]  He's trying to ring alarms that this is really planned, unless people stand up and oppose it, that this is really going to cause a disaster.
[02:18:00.146 --> 02:18:07.694]  And he says that, as you mentioned, that this government could perpetrate another terrorist attack to justify it.
[02:18:07.774 --> 02:18:14.982]  I mean, it's almost... Yeah, that's the guy who's been a Republican all his life, who was chief advisor to Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr., gave them their daily briefings.
[02:18:15.322 --> 02:18:16.063]  Thanks for the call.
[02:18:16.123 --> 02:18:19.347]  As for your question about the census, they admit it to be a yearly census now.
[02:18:20.347 --> 02:18:24.689]  Under the 4th and 5th Amendment, you don't have to answer any other questions, only how many people live there.
[02:18:25.189 --> 02:18:30.251]  And a federal judge in 2000 said it was illegal for them to demand that you fill out more than one question.
[02:18:30.331 --> 02:18:31.211]  So there's your answer.
[02:18:32.051 --> 02:18:33.011]  Who's up next here?
[02:18:33.071 --> 02:18:34.152]  Let's go to John.
[02:18:34.172 --> 02:18:35.452]  John, where are you calling us from?
[02:18:37.713 --> 02:18:39.814]  John, I believe you're calling... Where are you calling from, John?
[02:18:39.834 --> 02:18:41.434]  Oh, actually it's Jim.
[02:18:41.894 --> 02:18:43.015]  Okay, I was talking to John.
[02:18:43.905 --> 02:18:46.867]  Yeah, it's too bad your guest Amal was his name.
[02:18:47.207 --> 02:18:48.067]  It's too bad he's gone.
[02:18:48.107 --> 02:18:56.192]  I wanted to ask him if he could tell us specifically what frequency his chip and other chips are actually transmitting at.
[02:18:56.932 --> 02:19:02.676]  Because I know the human brain and body will respond in certain ways to specific frequencies.
[02:19:02.716 --> 02:19:04.077]  Well, I mean, that's in the future.
[02:19:04.117 --> 02:19:05.437]  They've got chips that'll do that.
[02:19:05.477 --> 02:19:07.619]  But I mean, just to start, these are just ID chips.
[02:19:07.959 --> 02:19:08.139]  Yeah.
[02:19:09.136 --> 02:19:11.639]  Well, yeah, that's something for people to look into.
[02:19:11.959 --> 02:19:16.504]  Regarding what you were saying about all the staged terror attacks, and new film sounds pretty good.
[02:19:16.544 --> 02:19:17.685]  I'll probably be picking that up.
[02:19:17.846 --> 02:19:20.308]  Well, it's not going to be ready for months.
[02:19:20.549 --> 02:19:26.835]  I'm just here doing even more research, and it's just... I mean, even the CIA's own website says they stage terror.
[02:19:26.896 --> 02:19:27.116]  I mean...
[02:19:29.579 --> 02:19:34.309]  Well, I think one of the main reasons people aren't waking up to this is because of the television.
[02:19:34.730 --> 02:19:36.313]  Tell you what, stay there Jim.
[02:19:36.354 --> 02:19:38.859]  I'll let you finish up and we'll go to David and Juan and others.
[02:19:40.350 --> 02:19:42.051]  What causes foods to spoil?
[02:19:42.471 --> 02:19:45.452]  All produce produces a natural gas which causes ripening.
[02:19:45.772 --> 02:19:51.054]  In addition, foods like onions and garlic emit odors, causing foods to lose their freshness and flavor.
[02:19:51.354 --> 02:20:00.877]  Now there's Forever Fresh for the fridge, a revolutionary new product proven to eliminate refrigerator odors and guaranteed to keep produce fresh at least twice as long as normal.
[02:20:01.157 --> 02:20:03.358]  Nancy McKimpson of Jacksonville, Florida says,
[02:20:03.658 --> 02:20:07.201]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, everything stays fresh much longer.
[02:20:07.461 --> 02:20:10.704]  Like strawberries, which now last a couple of weeks instead of just a few days.
[02:20:10.964 --> 02:20:14.507]  Jane Burke of New Jersey says... You know, we eat a lot of salads.
[02:20:14.667 --> 02:20:18.150]  I used to throw out the leftovers because they'd turn brown and they'd shrivel up.
[02:20:18.270 --> 02:20:19.532]  I'm really amazed.
[02:20:19.692 --> 02:20:25.517]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, all my produce stays fresher longer, including the leftovers.
[02:20:25.677 --> 02:20:28.099]  Now I just couldn't get along without Forever Fresh.
[02:20:28.439 --> 02:20:34.910]  To order your Forever Fresh for the fridge, visit the web at foreverfresh.us or call toll-free 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[02:20:35.050 --> 02:20:36.532]  That's 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[02:20:41.025 --> 02:20:42.086]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:20:42.486 --> 02:20:47.969]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:20:48.549 --> 02:20:49.029]  That's right.
[02:20:49.350 --> 02:20:51.631]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:20:51.951 --> 02:20:59.115]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:20:59.682 --> 02:21:07.368]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:21:07.808 --> 02:21:12.671]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:21:13.292 --> 02:21:16.314]  If you'd like to take a look at gold pre-retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:19.096 --> 02:21:23.217]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:21:23.597 --> 02:21:23.837]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:23.857 --> 02:21:25.798]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:21:25.958 --> 02:21:26.178]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:26.478 --> 02:21:26.738]  That's 1-800-686-2237.

[02:21:59.330 --> 02:22:01.973]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:22:02.313 --> 02:22:08.777]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:22:08.937 --> 02:22:10.798]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:22:10.999 --> 02:22:17.022]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.

[02:22:27.949 --> 02:22:28.629]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:22:40.419 --> 02:22:43.083]  Is your quality of life reduced because of health problems?
[02:22:43.303 --> 02:22:45.086]  Are you starting to feel the signs of aging?
[02:22:45.266 --> 02:22:49.292]  Are you relatively healthy but wonder if you can do more to maintain proper health?
[02:22:49.472 --> 02:22:50.854]  Now there's Stem Enhance.
[02:22:51.254 --> 02:22:55.841]  Stem Enhance is a new product category of phytonutrients that help in renewing your body.
[02:22:56.101 --> 02:23:01.883]  Stem Enhance's natural ingredients help to support the release of stem cells from your bone marrow into your bloodstream.
[02:23:02.083 --> 02:23:13.526]  Through a natural process, those stem cells have the amazing ability to transform into any type of cell in the body, like heart cells, brain cells, liver cells, can all be generated from this powerful building block.
[02:23:13.806 --> 02:23:22.548]  Thousands of people who use Stem Enhance have reported spectacular results, experiencing everything from an increase in energy in just a few days, to an improvement in overall
[02:23:23.629 --> 02:23:29.012]  Not available in stores, Stem in Hand is available by contacting Dr. Patricia Markaitis at 860-567-7744.
[02:23:29.072 --> 02:23:29.572]  That's 860-567-7744.
[02:24:04.906 --> 02:24:13.335]  We have a government openly run by a bunch of war profiteers who are engaging in every criminal action imaginable.
[02:24:13.915 --> 02:24:14.836]  War profiteering.
[02:24:14.876 --> 02:24:15.537]  It's all illegal.
[02:24:16.954 --> 02:24:35.418]  And then on top of that, they're telling us torture's good, the President's above the law, they're building camps for our safety, lots of military urban warfare training in our cities, you go videotape the troops, I've done it, they'll admit it's for taking over America, the news will tell you it's for Iraq or Syria, and it's just an ongoing classical takeover.
[02:24:36.225 --> 02:24:39.790]  They're handing over our ports, they're handing over our roads to foreign companies.
[02:24:39.810 --> 02:24:40.991]  The U.S.
[02:24:41.031 --> 02:24:44.235]  government won't even let, in most cases, American companies get these anymore.
[02:24:44.716 --> 02:24:46.278]  Most of the lobbyists are foreign.
[02:24:46.298 --> 02:24:48.220]  I mean, it's just a sellout.
[02:24:48.240 --> 02:24:51.825]  And I'm sorry if it sounds like we're just griping here, but stuff's serious, folks.
[02:24:51.845 --> 02:24:55.469]  I mean, if your house is on fire, don't expect me to come over and invite you to, you know,
[02:24:55.629 --> 02:24:56.730]  Hey, come out and play poker.
[02:24:56.770 --> 02:24:57.451]  Everything's great.
[02:24:57.771 --> 02:24:59.472]  I'm going to go, hey, your house is on fire.
[02:24:59.532 --> 02:24:59.993]  Wake up!
[02:25:00.313 --> 02:25:01.154]  Do something about it.
[02:25:01.174 --> 02:25:04.076]  You're like, yeah, but Jessica Simpson broke up with her husband.
[02:25:04.296 --> 02:25:08.340]  Hey, I know that's really important, but the country's turning into Nazi Germany.
[02:25:09.661 --> 02:25:11.322]  Jim, in Wisconsin.
[02:25:11.342 --> 02:25:12.223]  Finish up what you were saying.
[02:25:12.784 --> 02:25:17.448]  Well, yeah, I was just saying, you know, television is playing a direct role in what you're talking about.
[02:25:17.508 --> 02:25:21.231]  And the same people that are the war profiteers are the media profiteers.
[02:25:22.052 --> 02:25:31.262]  And so it's just connected that way and people really should be just watching, you know, DVDs like Order of Death, Loose Change, instead of the West Wing and all this crap.
[02:25:31.362 --> 02:25:33.464]  So, that's basically all I had to say.
[02:25:34.165 --> 02:25:35.386]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[02:25:35.687 --> 02:25:35.927]  Listen...
[02:25:36.627 --> 02:25:42.170]  Five years ago, you couldn't find organic food at 90 plus percent of the grocery stores in the country.
[02:25:42.690 --> 02:25:47.693]  Even in quote progressive Austin, there was one or two little stores where you could get it.
[02:25:47.793 --> 02:25:50.674]  Now, the mega stores are all organic.
[02:25:51.155 --> 02:25:52.876]  They're making money hand over fist.
[02:25:52.936 --> 02:25:54.216]  It's growing the market.
[02:25:54.276 --> 02:25:57.878]  More people are learning about organics because it's now available.
[02:25:57.978 --> 02:26:01.080]  It's an ever-expanding paradigm.
[02:26:02.250 --> 02:26:05.132]  It's the same thing with the truth movement and the alternative media.
[02:26:05.472 --> 02:26:06.512]  We have exploded.
[02:26:06.692 --> 02:26:07.493]  And we're fractured.
[02:26:07.773 --> 02:26:08.413]  That's a good thing.
[02:26:08.473 --> 02:26:12.616]  There's lots and lots of different people and lots of different views and lots of different debates.
[02:26:12.936 --> 02:26:14.217]  There's a wide range.
[02:26:14.257 --> 02:26:25.903]  And together, the alternative media is now as big, this is official numbers, though there's millions of us and just a few dozen of the big globalist media corporations, we are now as big as they are.
[02:26:26.551 --> 02:26:30.214]  And they know that in the near future they're going to be losing their monopoly.
[02:26:30.254 --> 02:26:34.857]  So they're moving ahead to try to tax and regulate and control the internet.
[02:26:35.278 --> 02:26:37.820]  To try to bring these controls into place.
[02:26:38.260 --> 02:26:41.282]  But they're failing because people are learning there's an alternative.
[02:26:41.643 --> 02:26:46.826]  And stopping a mass of people from migrating to something new is very very hard to do.
[02:26:47.247 --> 02:26:50.890]  Unless you carry out catastrophic events to get them back in line.
[02:26:51.250 --> 02:26:53.932]  And bring in draconian controls in the name of safety.
[02:26:54.572 --> 02:26:54.893]  I.e.
[02:26:54.973 --> 02:27:01.361]  atomic attacks, stage bio-attacks, all the things the government says isn't a question of if, but when.
[02:27:02.330 --> 02:27:05.413]  This is how they hope to maintain their monopoly of control.
[02:27:05.933 --> 02:27:12.859]  So if you will buy our videos and books and materials, if you will support the alternative media, it will then grow.
[02:27:13.299 --> 02:27:22.406]  More people who were mainstream media reporters will be able to make a living telling the truth instead of making a living telling lies.
[02:27:22.446 --> 02:27:26.290]  Then there'll be more truth out there and more options out there.
[02:27:26.370 --> 02:27:30.933]  More people will then become exposed to it, hence more support of the truth movement.
[02:27:32.274 --> 02:27:36.677]  It's a symbiotic, self-feeding system that expands.
[02:27:37.078 --> 02:27:38.238]  And the globalists know that.
[02:27:38.318 --> 02:27:38.659]  They know.
[02:27:38.679 --> 02:27:41.641]  In fact, Rumsfeld's given two speeches in the last month.
[02:27:41.721 --> 02:27:43.182]  Harvard has put out reports.
[02:27:43.822 --> 02:27:45.223]  The Rand Corporation has.
[02:27:45.363 --> 02:27:53.529]  Others have, saying that the establishment propaganda is no longer working, no matter how sophisticated, on a larger and larger majority of people.
[02:27:53.829 --> 02:27:55.650]  They're losing the propaganda war.
[02:27:55.750 --> 02:27:56.351]  And you know why?
[02:27:56.371 --> 02:27:59.493]  Because you're a bunch of liars, and we're telling the truth.
[02:28:00.561 --> 02:28:08.088]  And so they're flooding things with provocateurs, disinfo people, running COINTELPRO operations, trying to get patriots to all fight with each other.
[02:28:08.509 --> 02:28:10.030]  But people become immune to that.
[02:28:10.090 --> 02:28:11.071]  People are waking up.
[02:28:11.832 --> 02:28:14.955]  You'll see these provocateurs show up on the scene for a year.
[02:28:15.155 --> 02:28:16.636]  They'll try to act like they're legitimate.
[02:28:16.877 --> 02:28:21.421]  Then after a year, it's a formula, they then start attacking everyone in the truth movement.
[02:28:21.701 --> 02:28:24.244]  And we now just saw that again with somebody else this weekend.
[02:28:24.724 --> 02:28:25.585]  Another carpetbagger.
[02:28:26.396 --> 02:28:28.879]  And so it's across the board.
[02:28:29.279 --> 02:28:34.206]  There is so much of this going on, but it's because they're losing.
[02:28:34.567 --> 02:28:36.009]  They're losing control.
[02:28:36.089 --> 02:28:37.050]  They're panicking.
[02:28:37.090 --> 02:28:39.854]  Listen, I'm getting new Eminem affiliates every week.
[02:28:40.473 --> 02:28:44.056]  Because this message is becoming more and more mainstream.
[02:28:44.436 --> 02:28:51.842]  If I can point somebody to CIA.gov, where they're admitting that they carry out terror attacks, it's over for them.
[02:28:52.182 --> 02:28:54.043]  The problem is, this is all public.
[02:28:54.324 --> 02:28:55.785]  They can't even hide it anymore.
[02:28:56.205 --> 02:28:57.566]  And I think they miscalculated.
[02:28:57.606 --> 02:29:01.689]  About four or five years ago, they sort of just, what I call, throwing it in our face.
[02:29:02.209 --> 02:29:03.030]  Ah, so what?
[02:29:03.510 --> 02:29:05.192]  Just hiding it in plain view.
[02:29:05.972 --> 02:29:07.372]  And we've ferreted it out.
[02:29:07.452 --> 02:29:08.413]  You've ferreted it out.
[02:29:08.473 --> 02:29:09.453]  We've exposed it.
[02:29:10.193 --> 02:29:10.873]  And it's over.
[02:29:11.713 --> 02:29:13.254]  I mean, we've got rough times ahead.
[02:29:13.294 --> 02:29:14.714]  You know, the fight's just begun.
[02:29:15.114 --> 02:29:20.715]  But I can see over the horizon here, and I'm telling you folks, they're in deep, deep trouble.
[02:29:22.336 --> 02:29:24.696]  They're in for a rough ride.
[02:29:24.756 --> 02:29:25.396]  So are we.
[02:29:25.796 --> 02:29:27.997]  But they know they've lost momentum.
[02:29:28.257 --> 02:29:29.237]  They've lost the initiative.
[02:29:30.664 --> 02:29:33.665]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:34.586 --> 02:29:37.407]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:43.810 --> 02:29:49.052]  Do you desire your health and vitality to be in harmony with the rhythms of nature?
[02:29:51.863 --> 02:30:00.226]  TriVortex technology features subtle energy products that boost energy levels, release pain and stress, and much more at very affordable prices.
[02:30:00.886 --> 02:30:08.329]  You have the opportunity to wear vitamins, minerals, and nutrients that absorb through your skin rather than taking them orally.
[02:30:08.829 --> 02:30:10.610]  This is real, not science fiction.
[02:30:11.270 --> 02:30:19.933]  Go to TriVortex.com, that is T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X.com to open a whole new realm of health and vitality for you and your family.
[02:30:22.443 --> 02:30:32.069]  This is Brian David Anderson, inventor of TriVortex technology products that assist in so many areas, such as pain relief, symptoms of menopause, losing weight, or stopping smoking.
[02:30:32.569 --> 02:30:36.492]  TriVortex technology is in harmony with the rhythms of nature.
[02:30:39.625 --> 02:30:47.127]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:30:47.407 --> 02:30:58.330]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:30:58.530 --> 02:30:58.890]  We're good to go!
[02:31:15.080 --> 02:31:15.560]  That's right!
[02:31:15.760 --> 02:31:22.863]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:31:23.143 --> 02:31:27.285]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[02:31:27.445 --> 02:31:31.886]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:31:31.946 --> 02:31:32.607]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:31:32.627 --> 02:31:36.108]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:31:43.951 --> 02:31:47.354]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:31:47.535 --> 02:31:50.978]  Here's Dr. Matson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:31:51.269 --> 02:31:54.510]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:31:54.530 --> 02:31:59.991]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[02:32:00.031 --> 02:32:08.113]  When we do our program, you know, in herpal form it's like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jobs a few months later.
[02:32:08.293 --> 02:32:09.653]  We know we're doing something right.
[02:32:09.793 --> 02:32:11.154]  It's a well thought out formula.
[02:32:11.174 --> 02:32:16.555]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:32:16.972 --> 02:32:22.957]  If you'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems, it'll work on other problems as well.
[02:32:23.117 --> 02:32:26.580]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.

[02:32:42.116 --> 02:32:47.281]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:32:47.941 --> 02:32:50.323]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:32:50.343 --> 02:32:56.008]  Let me cover a few news items and then we're going to go right back to your calls.
[02:32:56.048 --> 02:32:57.289]  Toll free number to join us 1-800-259-9231.
[02:32:57.309 --> 02:32:58.510]  But if you've got friends or family
[02:33:03.695 --> 02:33:05.015]  To doubt that the U.S.
[02:33:05.055 --> 02:33:06.796]  government carries out terror attacks.
[02:33:07.656 --> 02:33:21.279]  I was even amazed that I was on the CIA's own website last night and they were admitting to Gladio, they were admitting to Mosaddegh, they were admitting about how they went and carried out terror attacks and how cute it is.
[02:33:22.859 --> 02:33:27.180]  And then they do it again and we're supposed to just go, oh no, it was Arabs.
[02:33:27.800 --> 02:33:28.520]  It was Arabs.
[02:33:29.734 --> 02:33:56.574]  The analogy is, if you've got somebody on your street who was convicted of robbing 10 banks 20 years ago, and they get out of jail, and then somebody robs the corner bank, and the witnesses say that they saw somebody who fits the description of your neighbor, and you call the police and they say, oh no, we're not going to come interview the convicted bank robber who just got out, and it matches the description, it doesn't matter if he's an admitted bank robber, we're just going to go arrest somebody else.
[02:33:59.733 --> 02:34:00.434]  It's insane!
[02:34:00.914 --> 02:34:03.617]  It's totally insane, the more I think about it.
[02:34:03.677 --> 02:34:20.773]  Now, the end of dollar hegemony, a long speech by Ron Paul, but he goes into, a hundred years ago it was called dollar diplomacy, after World War II, and especially after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989, that policy evolved into dollar hegemony.
[02:34:21.613 --> 02:34:26.035]  But after all these many years of great success, our dollar dominance is coming to an end.
[02:34:26.575 --> 02:34:30.718]  It has been said, rightly, that he who holds the gold makes the rules.
[02:34:30.798 --> 02:34:38.441]  It is earlier times it was readily accepted that fair and honest trade required an exchange for something of real value.
[02:34:39.142 --> 02:34:47.786]  And then he gets into the Federal Reserve and the fiat system and how they've devalued it by design and how it portends the end of empires.
[02:34:48.442 --> 02:34:49.986]  The fall of empires.
[02:34:50.407 --> 02:34:52.451]  The fall of societies.
[02:34:54.396 --> 02:34:56.040]  And that's what's happening today.
[02:34:57.339 --> 02:35:03.562]  And it is not good for any of us, but the media predominantly totally ignores what's happening.
[02:35:03.902 --> 02:35:05.082]  Meanwhile, some good news.
[02:35:05.182 --> 02:35:08.344]  Iran calls for an end to cartoon violence out of AP.
[02:35:08.904 --> 02:35:19.968]  Iranian Foreign Minister on Monday called for an end to violent protest over cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad, which have swept the Muslim world after the images were published in several European newspapers.
[02:35:20.048 --> 02:35:22.549]  Quote, we should try to cool down the situation.
[02:35:22.849 --> 02:35:24.190]  We do not support any violence.
[02:35:24.930 --> 02:35:32.632]  Adding that freedom of expression must be exercised with sensitivity and peoples and nations values and benefits fully respected.
[02:35:32.913 --> 02:35:33.773]  Well, I disagree with that.
[02:35:33.813 --> 02:35:35.133]  That's not what freedom of speech is.
[02:35:35.653 --> 02:35:36.714]  So you need to get that straight.
[02:35:37.194 --> 02:35:42.996]  Number two, clearly it's been proven now to be a neocon operation to stir up the Arabs and the Muslims.
[02:35:43.036 --> 02:35:44.116]  They fell right into the trap.
[02:35:45.036 --> 02:35:53.159]  But nevertheless, the globalists are manipulating things to create fear in the West on the eve of airstrikes on Iran.
[02:35:54.033 --> 02:35:59.157]  Which could come any day or any month now, or they could not attack them, or they could wait a year.
[02:35:59.197 --> 02:36:07.645]  Remember, they were going to attack in the fall of, excuse me, the spring of 2002, and so they attacked in the spring of 2003.
[02:36:08.045 --> 02:36:10.407]  Coming up on three years in March.
[02:36:10.987 --> 02:36:13.569]  Next month, three years of occupation.
[02:36:14.050 --> 02:36:15.631]  Thousands and thousands of dead U.S.
[02:36:15.671 --> 02:36:17.593]  troops, and Bush says, bring it on.
[02:36:18.454 --> 02:36:18.775]  U.S.
[02:36:18.975 --> 02:36:24.582]  asked Georgia to use bases and airfields for attacks on Iran, paper reports.
[02:36:25.143 --> 02:36:32.954]  American officials are probing whether Georgia, situated just northwest of Iran, will allow Washington
[02:36:33.314 --> 02:36:42.140]  to use its military bases and airfields in the event of a military conflict with Tehran, the Jerusalem Post reported today, citing an unnamed Georgian official.
[02:36:42.160 --> 02:36:45.363]  The Americans have been putting out feelers, the source said.
[02:36:45.403 --> 02:36:53.989]  A high-ranking Georgian government foreign affairs official said in advance of a possible military strike to prevent Iran from achieving nuclear weapons capability.
[02:36:54.589 --> 02:37:03.972]  American reports in recent months speculating about the possibility of a campaign against Iran because of the failure of diplomatic efforts to thwart a potential nuclear weapons program.
[02:37:04.312 --> 02:37:08.134]  A potential nuclear weapons program.
[02:37:08.174 --> 02:37:15.636]  Georgian government officials said that their capital fears harsh Iranian military retaliation against the Georgian Republic, because they're just north of it.
[02:37:16.574 --> 02:37:16.994]  If U.S.
[02:37:17.034 --> 02:37:29.456]  forces were to use its territory as a base for strikes against Iran, but nonetheless may feel obligated to give in to such a request, given the country's heavy reliance on U.S.
[02:37:29.517 --> 02:37:30.957]  aid and support, the U.S.
[02:37:30.997 --> 02:37:36.058]  maintains its own military bases in Georgia, and tortures American citizens there at death camps, by the way, I would add.
[02:37:37.078 --> 02:37:39.058]  And remember, Congress has been testimony.
[02:37:39.098 --> 02:37:42.379]  There's 50-plus programs you don't even know about where they're doing all this.
[02:37:44.429 --> 02:37:47.952]  Here's a little blurb out of the Sydney Morning Herald I thought I'd mention.
[02:37:48.112 --> 02:37:57.979]  Detention camp jitters, recent pronouncements from the Bush administration and national security initiatives put in place during the Reagan era, and I have a Senate video of them talking about the camps.
[02:37:59.020 --> 02:38:02.942]  Could see internment camps and martial law in the United States.
[02:38:02.962 --> 02:38:06.845]  See, now it's just mainstream news, just calmly being reported.
[02:38:07.886 --> 02:38:12.049]  Let me get now back to your call, but before I do that, here's a little blurb from
[02:38:12.907 --> 02:38:27.681]  Today TV out in San Francisco, another alternative media group, and I'm glad they picked up our blurb about the Cheney shooting and our reenactment of that that has just been a huge splash on the web.
[02:38:27.721 --> 02:38:33.907]  People really are getting it and spreading the word, so I want to thank those who helped us initially get it out, keep promoting it.
[02:38:34.108 --> 02:38:36.250]  Let's go ahead and roll that clip, then we'll take some calls.
[02:38:38.052 --> 02:38:48.938]  Story today from Infowars.com, who have put together a ballistic test challenging the official story of the Dick Cheney hunting accident that happened last weekend, indicating that some sort of cover-up is in progress.
[02:38:49.651 --> 02:38:52.313]  Now, Cheney claimed that he shot Whittington at 90 feet.
[02:38:52.893 --> 02:38:59.937]  Ballistic tests from the speed of shotgun pellets and their penetration depth and the spread, those are 100% conclusive tests you can make.
[02:39:00.478 --> 02:39:08.382]  Harry Whittington was shot at close range, probably between 15 and 18 feet, and not the 90 feet claimed by Dick Cheney and the Secret Service.
[02:39:09.063 --> 02:39:11.684]  The mainstream media is ignoring this literal smoking gun evidence.
[02:39:12.185 --> 02:39:19.089]  Anyone can conduct their own tests, and the ballistics of shotguns and birdshot are well known to tens of millions of Americans who hunt fowl.
[02:39:19.798 --> 02:39:27.545]  You can visit InfoWars.com to see a video clip and much more information on their scientific tests with an engineer and a police officer on site.
[02:39:28.967 --> 02:39:31.189]  All right, so we did a pretty good job with that.
[02:39:31.249 --> 02:39:33.651]  I want to thank my crew for a job well done.
[02:39:34.492 --> 02:39:36.434]  And now more and more is coming out.
[02:39:36.474 --> 02:39:38.095]  Mary Madeline's own statement.
[02:39:38.335 --> 02:39:42.019]  She's the PR specialist for Chaney, Rove's lieutenant.
[02:39:42.813 --> 02:39:46.234]  Of course, her husband is a lieutenant for Clinton, and it's all totally staged.
[02:39:46.294 --> 02:39:47.795]  Clinton's now a member of the family, of course.
[02:39:48.255 --> 02:39:50.396]  Always been a made man, a member of the crime family.
[02:39:51.036 --> 02:39:57.059]  And, uh, she comes out and goes, oh, well, at first we were going to issue a statement not even saying who got shot, or that Cheney done the shooting.
[02:39:57.722 --> 02:39:59.122]  But then later we didn't do that.
[02:39:59.443 --> 02:40:07.005]  So something so bad happened that they didn't put out their story for 22 hours and wouldn't talk to the police.
[02:40:07.085 --> 02:40:08.285]  I kept saying 13 plus.
[02:40:08.645 --> 02:40:10.526]  The mainstream media is now saying 15 hours.
[02:40:10.566 --> 02:40:12.106]  But I did the math.
[02:40:12.126 --> 02:40:13.287]  It was like 13 and a half hours.
[02:40:13.767 --> 02:40:15.147]  I mean, something got covered up.
[02:40:15.207 --> 02:40:16.267]  We know they're lying.
[02:40:16.808 --> 02:40:18.588]  And some people say, well, it's an accident.
[02:40:18.628 --> 02:40:19.048]  Who cares?
[02:40:19.448 --> 02:40:20.609]  Hey, it is an accident.
[02:40:20.709 --> 02:40:21.709]  Accidents do happen.
[02:40:22.774 --> 02:40:23.915]  Why did Cheney lie?
[02:40:23.955 --> 02:40:25.255]  Because it's second nature.
[02:40:25.695 --> 02:40:27.016]  Why did they try to cover this up?
[02:40:27.076 --> 02:40:28.256]  Why did they block the police?
[02:40:28.436 --> 02:40:29.537]  That's the story.
[02:40:30.337 --> 02:40:35.839]  Not that Cheney's an idiot and swung 180 degrees around to shoot Whittington in the face and chest.
[02:40:36.779 --> 02:40:42.661]  And now they're admitting, and we have mainstream reports on this, we just updated, that the doctors are saying he had 200 plus.
[02:40:45.396 --> 02:40:47.377]  It just says, over 200 pellets in it.
[02:40:47.938 --> 02:40:52.841]  And they admit that that particular shotgun round had 265 pellets in it.
[02:40:53.241 --> 02:40:55.222]  That means only 65 pellets missed.
[02:40:55.282 --> 02:41:01.646]  Folks, we shot an almost exact same load from the exact same type of shotgun, same length barrel.
[02:41:01.686 --> 02:41:02.306]  We shot a 7.5.
[02:41:02.867 --> 02:41:06.129]  It is the exact, but depending on the different company, it's slightly different.
[02:41:06.909 --> 02:41:09.911]  Because we can't find out the exact company name of what shells they were using.
[02:41:09.951 --> 02:41:11.492]  Just 2 and 3 quarter inch.
[02:41:12.139 --> 02:41:12.640]  We're good to go.
[02:41:30.955 --> 02:41:31.795]  90 feet is 30 yards.
[02:41:31.815 --> 02:41:35.437]  We're just doing the conversion, folks, for those that don't know and are as dumb as I am.
[02:41:35.697 --> 02:41:39.698]  Most of you are smarter than I am, so you don't need to have that clarified, but I've been getting questions about it.
[02:41:39.838 --> 02:41:41.119]  There's been websites questioning it.
[02:41:41.359 --> 02:41:43.460]  First he says 90 feet, then he says 30 yards.
[02:41:43.680 --> 02:41:44.500]  Which is it, Jones?
[02:41:44.540 --> 02:41:45.780]  Well, it's the same thing.
[02:41:45.840 --> 02:41:47.861]  It's like, forget it.
[02:41:47.921 --> 02:41:49.162]  I'm not even going to try to explain it.
[02:41:49.882 --> 02:41:53.423]  These neocons will find any reason to not listen and just ignore what we're saying.
[02:41:55.024 --> 02:41:58.145]  But clearly, folks, I mean, at 90 feet,
[02:41:59.455 --> 02:42:09.120]  Having 200 plus BBs of 265 hit, we were shooting at 30 feet away, and a lot of the BBs were shooting around man-sized targets.
[02:42:10.601 --> 02:42:11.261]  Can you imagine?
[02:42:11.301 --> 02:42:15.503]  At 90 feet, most of it was missing, so there's no doubting it.
[02:42:16.344 --> 02:42:18.245]  Absolutely no doubting it.
[02:42:19.765 --> 02:42:22.607]  And with that, I'm done talking about Chaney.
[02:42:23.703 --> 02:42:29.147]  The Iran War is much bigger and much more serious and all this other stuff's happening.
[02:42:29.247 --> 02:42:34.390]  It's just when you catch him in the middle of a scam, you got to talk about it.
[02:42:34.991 --> 02:42:38.013]  All right, let's go ahead and go to, who's up next here?
[02:42:38.053 --> 02:42:38.713]  David Norrigan?
[02:42:40.294 --> 02:42:41.115]  David, you're on the air.
[02:42:41.155 --> 02:42:41.555]  Go ahead.
[02:42:41.575 --> 02:42:42.936]  Hi Alex, you're great.
[02:42:43.016 --> 02:42:44.197]  Thank you for having me on the air.
[02:42:44.257 --> 02:42:44.998]  No, no, you're great.
[02:42:45.598 --> 02:42:46.999]  Oh, Alex, you're awesome.
[02:42:47.019 --> 02:42:49.621]  But the CIA, you know, they're taking over the country.
[02:42:50.205 --> 02:42:51.486]  They're doing really bad stuff.
[02:42:51.586 --> 02:42:53.447]  People are buying genetically altered food.
[02:42:53.487 --> 02:42:57.388]  They're ignorantly just going to McDonald's, Walmart, Costco.
[02:42:57.688 --> 02:43:00.910]  You know, they're doing so bad, and they're just doing it ignorantly.
[02:43:01.010 --> 02:43:02.911]  And that's what these globalists are loving.
[02:43:02.951 --> 02:43:04.231]  You know, I'm going to make this point.
[02:43:04.271 --> 02:43:10.674]  We are creatures of habit, and if they can get us in the habit of accepting scanner toll roads, it's over.
[02:43:10.694 --> 02:43:13.556]  If they can get us in the habit of eating GMO, it's over.
[02:43:13.576 --> 02:43:16.097]  If they can get us in the habit of drinking tap water, it's over.
[02:43:16.577 --> 02:43:21.060]  People need to know that tap water is worse than cigarettes, major studies show, in most cities.
[02:43:21.500 --> 02:43:24.422]  They need to know that GMO food isn't just not nutritious.
[02:43:24.922 --> 02:43:33.146]  These genetically modified transgenic organisms, cross species, I've had Nobel Prize winners on, is deadly toxic.
[02:43:33.327 --> 02:43:34.467]  It's a new creation.
[02:43:34.727 --> 02:43:35.588]  It's poisonous.
[02:43:36.268 --> 02:43:39.311]  It kills most of the baby rats and guinea pigs and rabbits.
[02:43:41.672 --> 02:43:43.294]  Listen, there's no debating.
[02:43:43.774 --> 02:43:59.406]  And that's what's so insane about this is that there's no debating that the elite is destroying their own planet, meanwhile controlling the environmental movement to take away private property rights and then let the multinationals keep poisoning.
[02:43:59.686 --> 02:44:02.488]  And the idiot environmentalists, most of them, don't even know about this.
[02:44:02.728 --> 02:44:06.749]  They're just co-opted for the Supreme Court crowd to grab property.
[02:44:07.829 --> 02:44:12.311]  We're not allowed to have a year's worth of food in Oregon, Washington, and California.
[02:44:12.711 --> 02:44:13.271]  It's illegal.
[02:44:13.291 --> 02:44:15.592]  That's right, they have a hoarding law.
[02:44:15.692 --> 02:44:16.052]  Why?
[02:44:16.472 --> 02:44:21.733]  Why does the government have giant bunkers full of goods and food and weapons, but we're bad if we do?
[02:44:22.174 --> 02:44:27.055]  And we can't even run to the National Forest if they take over our cities because it's UN land now.
[02:44:29.122 --> 02:44:29.482]  I know!
[02:44:29.843 --> 02:44:31.144]  And people didn't believe me on that.
[02:44:31.184 --> 02:44:32.225]  Now it's mainstream news.
[02:44:32.485 --> 02:44:36.148]  Now it's in the... Oh, what's the paper there in Orlando?
[02:44:36.889 --> 02:44:37.749]  Orlando Sentinel?
[02:44:38.070 --> 02:44:39.771]  Orlando... Doesn't matter.
[02:44:39.991 --> 02:44:42.053]  We've got to stop supporting these corporations.
[02:44:42.153 --> 02:44:46.457]  We need to start reinvesting in American citizens.
[02:44:46.497 --> 02:44:48.759]  At this point, it's about survival.
[02:44:49.079 --> 02:44:52.482]  And the first thing you've got to do is limit TV to maybe one hour a week.
[02:44:53.268 --> 02:44:57.530]  And the first thing you gotta do, folks, is stop playing the violent video games five hours a day.
[02:44:57.830 --> 02:44:59.410]  And start getting to know your neighbors.
[02:44:59.470 --> 02:45:00.751]  And start loving your family.
[02:45:01.131 --> 02:45:10.554]  And not doing whatever the... I mean, the government, through its PR, tells us what is trendy, and then everybody goes out and enslaves themselves because the government says it's cool.
[02:45:11.095 --> 02:45:14.636]  For the cable, the satellite, you gotta stop paying for it.
[02:45:14.656 --> 02:45:20.378]  They're taking our freedoms by us just sitting down and paying for something.
[02:45:20.988 --> 02:45:21.448]  No, no, no.
[02:45:21.688 --> 02:45:22.048]  I agree.
[02:45:22.088 --> 02:45:23.589]  We pay for our own slavery.
[02:45:23.649 --> 02:45:28.751]  And so many things with the government, they force you to pay for your own slavery, but not with these corporations.
[02:45:30.011 --> 02:45:33.653]  You know, they force-vaccinated me just to go to school when I was a kid, you know?
[02:45:33.773 --> 02:45:35.854]  And there was never a law that you had to do that.
[02:45:36.114 --> 02:45:38.214]  Through color of law, they racketeered.
[02:45:38.455 --> 02:45:39.595]  They extorted you.
[02:45:39.755 --> 02:45:44.477]  They brainwashed my parents, who force-vaccinated me, because they were ignorant.
[02:45:45.417 --> 02:45:47.758]  And I resisted, but I still got a needle.
[02:45:48.158 --> 02:45:50.179]  So how do we stop the ignorance?
[02:45:50.929 --> 02:45:52.711]  No, I agree with you.
[02:45:53.391 --> 02:45:54.112]  Here's an example.
[02:45:54.212 --> 02:45:57.214]  Every year at the start of school, a month before, I say, get ready.
[02:45:57.234 --> 02:46:06.621]  You're going to see this exact same newscast, exact same text on every major TV show in your area saying, it's the law, you must get vaccinated.
[02:46:06.861 --> 02:46:07.882]  But there is no law.
[02:46:08.502 --> 02:46:10.304]  It is, again, a mass hoax.
[02:46:10.704 --> 02:46:13.306]  The government and the media engage in hoaxes.
[02:46:13.846 --> 02:46:17.627]  In SPIN, or they lie by omission, and what is SPIN?
[02:46:17.687 --> 02:46:18.827]  See, there's different types of lies.
[02:46:19.208 --> 02:46:21.468]  SPIN is where they take something evil and say it's good.
[02:46:22.508 --> 02:46:25.589]  Lying by omission is only telling you part of the story to lie.
[02:46:25.989 --> 02:46:29.170]  And then they have hoaxes, which are just total lies.
[02:46:29.290 --> 02:46:32.991]  Every time I watch TV, I mean, I always get energized by it.
[02:46:33.011 --> 02:46:34.152]  I guess I should watch more of it.
[02:46:34.992 --> 02:46:37.553]  I mean, I watched a newscast last week locally.
[02:46:37.853 --> 02:46:39.273]  It was all lies.
[02:46:39.433 --> 02:46:42.354]  I could talk for three hours, just, but you know what?
[02:46:43.052 --> 02:46:52.699]  I went to my computer when I got home and I said, I'm going to go look randomly at other affiliates around the country and it's going to be the same newscast, some of the same reports.
[02:46:52.739 --> 02:46:53.359]  And it was.
[02:46:53.799 --> 02:46:55.521]  It's all packaged by the networks.
[02:46:55.841 --> 02:46:58.523]  They send it down in little pre-packaged news blurbs.
[02:46:58.883 --> 02:47:01.064]  They do a little voiceover locally.
[02:47:01.305 --> 02:47:04.127]  The local reporter doesn't even know they're involved in propaganda.
[02:47:04.327 --> 02:47:07.269]  To them it's like a coloring book, color between the lines.
[02:47:07.549 --> 02:47:10.471]  They don't know that they're being taught how to not be news reporters.
[02:47:11.877 --> 02:47:13.978]  Do you understand how maniacal this is?
[02:47:15.519 --> 02:47:16.239]  Thanks for the call.
[02:47:16.259 --> 02:47:32.247]  And then a billion, six hundred million dollars for fake newscasts in the last two and a half years, and that's what the Congressional Budget Office and the GAO, Governmental Accounting Office, admit, and they say it's a felony each time they do it, but Bush says, I'm the law, I ain't gonna follow you.
[02:47:32.267 --> 02:47:35.109]  I mean, he actually said, I don't have to follow what you say.
[02:47:36.189 --> 02:47:37.550]  I mean, imagine, that's illegal.
[02:47:37.650 --> 02:47:39.831]  Republicans control the House, by the way.
[02:47:40.532 --> 02:47:42.194]  Their own board says it's illegal.
[02:47:42.554 --> 02:47:43.234]  No, it's not.
[02:47:43.275 --> 02:47:43.955]  I'm the president.
[02:47:46.638 --> 02:47:48.940]  And it's illegal to keep the cops out when you shoot somebody.
[02:47:48.980 --> 02:47:50.161]  But, oh, he's the vice president.
[02:47:50.181 --> 02:47:50.381]  See?
[02:47:50.541 --> 02:47:51.502]  They're kings.
[02:47:51.542 --> 02:47:52.283]  They're lords.
[02:47:52.743 --> 02:47:57.808]  Government servants are supposed to be held to a higher standard, not a lower standard.
[02:47:58.989 --> 02:48:00.730]  Let's go ahead and talk to Warren in Texas.
[02:48:00.770 --> 02:48:01.571]  Warren, go ahead.
[02:48:01.591 --> 02:48:03.833]  Hey, Alex.
[02:48:03.853 --> 02:48:04.353]  How you doing?
[02:48:04.554 --> 02:48:04.874]  Good, sir.
[02:48:06.405 --> 02:48:12.887]  Yeah, I've got a comment I'd like to make concerning these ports being taken over by the UAE.
[02:48:13.267 --> 02:48:14.467]  United Arab Emirates, yes sir.
[02:48:14.968 --> 02:48:21.729]  Yes sir, I think that this could be your next conspiracy theory that's actually conspiracy fact.
[02:48:21.769 --> 02:48:30.912]  They'll be able to take these ports over and then when something really strange happens they can blame it on the fact that it's controlled by foreigners perhaps.
[02:48:31.698 --> 02:48:32.779]  Well, I don't want to do that.
[02:48:32.859 --> 02:48:33.639]  I disagree with you.
[02:48:33.659 --> 02:48:34.700]  I mean, that's an interesting point.
[02:48:35.440 --> 02:48:39.583]  Because they're handing, I mean, China and England and the rest of them, the British, by the way, did own this.
[02:48:40.383 --> 02:48:44.486]  Most everything's already owned by foreigners to begin with, sir.
[02:48:44.786 --> 02:48:56.253]  And what's happening with these ports is the six ports they're buying have over, what did I read, 75% of port trade on the East Coast and the Gulf of New Orleans.
[02:48:56.894 --> 02:48:56.974]  Hmm.
[02:49:04.992 --> 02:49:06.932]  Okay, well... It's called infrastructure, Bubba.
[02:49:06.952 --> 02:49:09.033]  Did you know you can't buy land in Saudi Arabia?
[02:49:09.393 --> 02:49:13.014]  You, as an American, black, white, Hispanic, can't buy land in the UAE?
[02:49:13.374 --> 02:49:17.174]  Did you know you, until just a few years ago, couldn't even buy land in Mexico if you weren't a Mexican?
[02:49:17.474 --> 02:49:18.955]  Nobody else lets people do this.
[02:49:19.335 --> 02:49:22.695]  We're like a butcher shop, a pig that's been butchered.
[02:49:22.715 --> 02:49:23.896]  We don't even know that yet.
[02:49:24.216 --> 02:49:26.776]  There's more foreign lobbyists than American lobbyists.
[02:49:27.376 --> 02:49:31.717]  I mean, look, the King of Spain's taken over almost all the Texas roads, Bubba.
[02:49:32.685 --> 02:49:33.367]  It's what I've heard.
[02:49:33.387 --> 02:49:34.990]  That means it's public!
[02:49:35.912 --> 02:49:42.886]  Well, you know, if these ports are owned by foreigners, it seems like our government will have less
[02:49:43.604 --> 02:49:46.246]  responsibility over what comes in through these ports.
[02:49:46.306 --> 02:49:52.271]  They're already searching, what is it, you know, one container out of like a hundred, and then even that as a spot check.
[02:49:52.291 --> 02:49:53.572]  They're not searching anything.
[02:49:53.992 --> 02:49:55.594]  Sir, there's no real terror threat.
[02:49:55.834 --> 02:49:58.636]  When the globalists decide to A-bomb your city, don't worry.
[02:49:58.676 --> 02:50:01.038]  It didn't come in across the border.
[02:50:01.398 --> 02:50:04.701]  But they'll have some goofy, you know, low-grade moron error.
[02:50:04.741 --> 02:50:06.142]  They'll take the blame the next day.
[02:50:07.063 --> 02:50:08.724]  I'd also like to make another point.
[02:50:08.804 --> 02:50:11.907]  My dad isn't a big subscriber of your show.
[02:50:12.922 --> 02:50:21.833]  He thinks that you're a little tilted along the bias level, but I had a conversation with him about the Chaney issue because he was a bird hunter too.
[02:50:22.805 --> 02:50:29.388]  And, um, he says, yeah, he thinks that's just totally fabricated, made up, because he understands a little bit about the ballistics.
[02:50:29.608 --> 02:50:34.390]  Well, Stan, I want to let you finish up on the other side, then we'll talk to David and, uh, Tim.
[02:50:34.971 --> 02:50:35.951]  Everybody, stay with us.
[02:50:36.151 --> 02:50:36.771]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:36.811 --> 02:50:37.912]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:50:37.972 --> 02:50:38.472]  Check it out!
[02:50:38.712 --> 02:50:39.873]  PrisonPlanet.TV!
[02:50:40.193 --> 02:50:44.515]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:50:44.715 --> 02:50:49.057]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:50:52.233 --> 02:50:53.735]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:51:10.550 --> 02:51:20.855]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:51:21.155 --> 02:51:26.438]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:51:27.018 --> 02:51:29.659]  Visit Infowars.com or PrismPlanet.com to order.
[02:51:30.279 --> 02:51:33.880]  They're called toll-free, 1-888-253-3139.
[02:51:34.080 --> 02:51:36.121]  That's 888-253-3139.

[02:51:39.482 --> 02:51:41.463]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[02:51:41.563 --> 02:51:52.226]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:51:52.626 --> 02:51:57.148]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a black Berkey purification element.
[02:51:57.208 --> 02:52:08.533]  When used, water flow through the purification elements, where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:52:09.133 --> 02:52:15.982]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:52:16.383 --> 02:52:18.526]  Your purified water is now ready!
[02:52:19.006 --> 02:52:23.973]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 hose filter elements.
[02:52:24.273 --> 02:52:30.578]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:52:30.658 --> 02:52:34.821]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:52:35.081 --> 02:52:36.001]  That's toll free.
[02:52:36.021 --> 02:52:37.022]  888-803-4438.
[02:52:37.903 --> 02:52:40.705]  You don't love me anymore?
[02:52:41.065 --> 02:52:42.886]  You used to take such good care of me.
[02:52:43.166 --> 02:52:44.407]  Is that my car talking to me?
[02:52:44.487 --> 02:52:44.748]  Yes.
[02:52:45.068 --> 02:52:45.888]  You neglect me.
[02:52:45.908 --> 02:52:48.070]  Change my oil late most of the time.
[02:52:49.911 --> 02:52:50.852]  Use the cheapest gas.
[02:52:51.232 --> 02:52:52.092]  I'm getting sick.
[02:52:52.413 --> 02:52:54.613]  One of these days, I'm just gonna give up.
[02:52:55.654 --> 02:52:56.134]  Wait a minute.
[02:52:56.214 --> 02:52:57.835]  I've got three more years of payments on you.
[02:52:58.075 --> 02:53:06.638]  If you want me to last forever, you need to add Protecta Engine Treatment, Protecta Transmission Treatment, and especially Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment.
[02:53:07.099 --> 02:53:12.561]  Protecta's unique synthetic fortifiers treat the metal and the oil to reduce friction like no other.
[02:53:12.781 --> 02:53:15.182]  Okay, I'll add some Protecta, but you'll have to perform.
[02:53:15.322 --> 02:53:19.986]  How about faster acceleration, more horsepower, longer lasting.
[02:53:20.207 --> 02:53:21.868]  I'll always be there for you.
[02:53:22.048 --> 02:53:25.372]  So if you want more, treat it right with Protecta by SFR.
[02:53:25.572 --> 02:53:29.395]  For a special offer of free shipping, go to www.sfrcorp.com or call 888-USE-SFR1.
[02:53:29.415 --> 02:53:31.317]  That's www.sfrcorp.com or call 888-USE-SFR1.
[02:53:42.506 --> 02:53:43.707]  I'm going to admit something.
[02:53:43.787 --> 02:53:45.868]  I'm very biased towards liberty and freedom.
[02:53:47.569 --> 02:53:53.933]  Our government admits that thousands of times they've tested chemicals, biologicals, and radiologicals on us, including American schoolchildren.
[02:53:54.473 --> 02:53:57.014]  Americans on the subway in 1968 New York.
[02:53:57.074 --> 02:53:57.995]  They killed a bunch of us.
[02:53:58.615 --> 02:54:01.517]  They've killed our own troops and admitted tests and it's all declassified.
[02:54:01.537 --> 02:54:06.700]  You can go to the CIA website where they brag about how they carry out terror attacks to blame it on their foreign enemies.
[02:54:07.560 --> 02:54:10.482]  So I would tell you, Warren, to go to your father
[02:54:11.386 --> 02:54:25.339]  And just to type in CIA-Mozadek bombings, or terror, and you will get the CIA's website as one of the top links, at least I did last night, and there they are admitting and go, hey dad, they say they do this.
[02:54:25.619 --> 02:54:26.620]  Are they biased too?
[02:54:27.280 --> 02:54:29.262]  So, it's like the State Department.
[02:54:29.542 --> 02:54:32.345]  We put out reports about China selling political dissidents organs.
[02:54:32.365 --> 02:54:34.367]  They put ads in medical magazines.
[02:54:34.907 --> 02:54:43.369]  It's in the New York Times how every month hundreds of people fly in from Beijing, Americans, with a Chinese doctor who's gotten their organs from a political dissident.
[02:54:43.669 --> 02:54:47.390]  And then the State Department puts out a report saying we're making it up.
[02:54:47.470 --> 02:54:48.590]  It's an urban legend.
[02:54:48.810 --> 02:54:53.171]  And on the State Department's own website, they have past reports decrying it from five years ago.
[02:54:53.211 --> 02:54:55.911]  But see, now the policy is to say, no, it isn't happening.
[02:54:55.931 --> 02:54:56.831]  Because, see, they're for it.
[02:54:57.292 --> 02:54:58.312]  Warren, does that make sense?
[02:55:00.552 --> 02:55:04.413]  You played a clip earlier quoting your website, theinfowars.com.
[02:55:05.051 --> 02:55:09.073]  Concerning your ballistics test with the police officer?
[02:55:09.293 --> 02:55:09.614]  Yes.
[02:55:11.034 --> 02:55:12.715]  Where was that quote put from?
[02:55:13.756 --> 02:55:15.757]  That was from Today TV out in San Francisco.
[02:55:17.578 --> 02:55:28.084]  So you don't think that this port issue could be a way of manipulating weapons of mass destruction into our country if in fact they don't already have one here?
[02:55:28.324 --> 02:55:30.845]  The globalists just have a merc team go detonate one.
[02:55:30.865 --> 02:55:32.246]  They don't need to sneak one in.
[02:55:33.188 --> 02:55:35.009]  They're probably already here and assembled.
[02:55:35.649 --> 02:55:43.134]  I mean, look, they're going to build a spaceport in the United Arab Emirates because they're so rich, the Arabs are going to be having little space flights.
[02:55:43.554 --> 02:55:44.394]  Did you see that?
[02:55:44.635 --> 02:55:46.296]  Most of our money is right here from the U.S.
[02:55:46.316 --> 02:55:46.396]  oil.
[02:55:46.416 --> 02:55:48.117]  We're not allowed to have the Alaskan oil.
[02:55:48.197 --> 02:55:49.137]  It's about a monopoly.
[02:55:49.177 --> 02:55:49.818]  Thanks for the call.
[02:55:50.718 --> 02:55:51.899]  David in New Hampshire.
[02:55:51.939 --> 02:55:52.499]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:55:54.800 --> 02:55:55.221]  Ah, dude.
[02:55:55.621 --> 02:56:00.944]  Man, you don't want to be ruled over by mega, maniacal, crazy, satanic
[02:56:01.670 --> 02:56:02.411]  Evil people?
[02:56:02.591 --> 02:56:03.671]  You don't think that's a good idea?
[02:56:04.252 --> 02:56:05.412]  No, I'm biased against it.
[02:56:06.333 --> 02:56:06.813]  Oh, awesome.
[02:56:06.833 --> 02:56:07.173]  Me too.
[02:56:07.373 --> 02:56:07.834]  Good, good.
[02:56:08.314 --> 02:56:08.734]  Um, yeah.
[02:56:08.874 --> 02:56:11.135]  So, I just want to say, everybody get out there.
[02:56:11.155 --> 02:56:12.556]  Start talking to people.
[02:56:12.596 --> 02:56:13.937]  Don't be afraid to speak out.
[02:56:14.037 --> 02:56:22.442]  You know, it's kind of a good idea to say you're against slavery and murdering people and all sorts of stuff like that, so.
[02:56:23.202 --> 02:56:25.784]  Yeah, we need to, uh, get up all these points.
[02:56:26.204 --> 02:56:26.724]  Line them up.
[02:56:27.104 --> 02:56:28.125]  Ask people directly.
[02:56:28.991 --> 02:56:29.992]  See what they think.
[02:56:30.412 --> 02:56:32.953]  Get to know your neighbors.
[02:56:32.973 --> 02:56:35.535]  Stop playing the Xbox and the Playstation.
[02:56:36.275 --> 02:56:37.836]  And watch so much TV.
[02:56:37.876 --> 02:56:38.637]  Get out and breathe.
[02:56:39.850 --> 02:56:44.232]  Realize you're a live human being and you deserve the best life you can have.
[02:56:44.472 --> 02:56:47.914]  Human beings are incredible creatures made in the image of God.
[02:56:47.954 --> 02:56:56.717]  If you just start thinking about freedom, if you just start thinking about what you can do, if you just unlock your mind, then you'll start doing things that are part of the solution.
[02:56:56.737 --> 02:56:57.398]  Thanks for the call.
[02:56:57.858 --> 02:56:59.999]  Tim in New Jersey, last caller, go ahead.
[02:57:01.636 --> 02:57:02.177]  Hello, Alex.
[02:57:02.337 --> 02:57:02.817]  Yes, Tim.
[02:57:03.018 --> 02:57:04.780]  Hey, first of all, thanks for everything you do.
[02:57:04.940 --> 02:57:05.340]  Thank you.
[02:57:06.081 --> 02:57:11.006]  I just had really a two-pronged question about our intending invasion of Iran.
[02:57:12.568 --> 02:57:15.051]  The president, I guess his name is Ahmadinejad?
[02:57:15.471 --> 02:57:15.672]  Yes.
[02:57:17.371 --> 02:57:20.352]  Would you consider him to be a very outspoken person?
[02:57:20.392 --> 02:57:20.712]  Yes.
[02:57:21.973 --> 02:57:27.574]  They had a moderate government, but our threats to attack him would cause him to get elected, which is part of the Pentagon plan.
[02:57:28.114 --> 02:57:33.816]  And they want to get Iran to strike back, then it goes to a full-bore invasion, and they'll invade through the Basra area.
[02:57:34.056 --> 02:57:41.058]  But you don't think he might be on the payroll inciting and giving the... We know Ayatollah Khomeini was on the payroll for a while in Paris.
[02:57:41.138 --> 02:57:42.138]  You can't put it past him.
[02:57:42.418 --> 02:57:42.678]  Right.
[02:57:43.218 --> 02:57:53.121]  And, uh, I know you don't want to talk too much more about Cheney, but, uh, whenever something like that happens, I always wonder, uh, seeing that it takes so much of the news time away.
[02:57:53.422 --> 02:57:56.943]  No, no, I mean, it could be a big distraction, but I really, in my gut, don't think it is.
[02:57:56.963 --> 02:57:58.743]  I mean, this is embarrassing for them.
[02:57:58.763 --> 02:57:59.384]  They don't want this.
[02:57:59.664 --> 02:58:00.264]  We're out of time.
[02:58:00.284 --> 02:58:00.984]  Thank you for the call.
[02:58:01.024 --> 02:58:01.784]  Sorry, my friend.

[02:58:33.413 --> 02:58:36.196]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:58:36.456 --> 02:58:40.622]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:58:41.042 --> 02:58:41.883]  So what do you do?
[02:58:42.204 --> 02:58:46.789]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:58:47.270 --> 02:58:49.392]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:58:49.873 --> 02:58:50.714]  Sheltering in place.
