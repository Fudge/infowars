[00:00:05.467 --> 00:00:06.128]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.788 --> 00:00:07.849]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:09.650]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.331 --> 00:00:11.111]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.892 --> 00:00:12.812]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.453 --> 00:00:17.235]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.636 --> 00:00:21.739]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.963 --> 00:00:32.246]  Before I forget in the next three hours to mention it,
[00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:43.772]  Scott Hartman, who's been running this broadcast, what, two days a week, it's John Harmon the rest of the time, for the last two-plus years, isn't it, Scott?
[00:00:44.513 --> 00:00:52.675]  He's going to be, getting close to three, he's going to be leaving us today, but not leaving the Genesis happy family.
[00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.471]  Hi, everybody.
[00:00:54.531 --> 00:00:55.031]  Hi, everybody.
[00:01:22.984 --> 00:01:23.624]  You're on air now?
[00:01:23.644 --> 00:01:24.384]  Yeah.
[00:01:24.585 --> 00:01:24.745]  Good.
[00:01:25.065 --> 00:01:25.745]  I always hear him.
[00:01:25.765 --> 00:01:28.006]  You never hear him, so I'm never sure when you do hear him.
[00:01:28.586 --> 00:01:30.646]  Perhaps he isn't even real.
[00:01:31.807 --> 00:01:37.849]  Scott, you're saying farewell and moving into the office next door to the command control pod.
[00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:40.090]  Indeed, yeah.
[00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.331]  You're moving into the back room with the Reptoids that run Genesis.
[00:01:43.591 --> 00:01:45.831]  Right, where they keep us in the cramped, dark room.
[00:01:45.851 --> 00:01:47.852]  The little flying saucer there.
[00:01:47.912 --> 00:01:49.913]  It's buried underneath the building.
[00:01:49.933 --> 00:01:50.873]  Don't give away our secrets, Alex.
[00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.613]  The Sleece Sloths, or the Sleece Decks, Land of the Lost.
[00:01:55.713 --> 00:01:57.134]  Okay, now I've really gone crazy.
[00:01:57.574 --> 00:02:01.056]  Hey, Scott, has it been fun the last two-plus years working here?
[00:02:01.496 --> 00:02:03.298]  I've had a grand time with you, Alex.
[00:02:03.418 --> 00:02:05.399]  I've appreciated everything you've done for me.
[00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:07.961]  And now it's your lust for money.
[00:02:08.321 --> 00:02:08.801]  Exactly.
[00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:12.283]  It's taking you, okay, over to the dark side.
[00:02:12.303 --> 00:02:12.844]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:02:13.684 --> 00:02:15.866]  It's never too late, Lord Vader, to turn back.
[00:02:17.745 --> 00:02:19.926]  All right, well, anything else you'd like to add here?
[00:02:20.947 --> 00:02:29.991]  I've appreciated everybody that's been kind to me when they've called into your show, and I've had a good time, and I'll be back from time to time so I don't get rusty.
[00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:30.872]  You shall.
[00:02:30.992 --> 00:02:34.213]  You shall come back through on your elliptical orbit occasionally.
[00:02:35.234 --> 00:02:39.036]  All right, well, farewell, dear Prince.
[00:02:39.356 --> 00:02:39.876]  Take care.
[00:02:40.737 --> 00:02:42.538]  All right, there goes Scott Hartman.
[00:02:42.918 --> 00:02:44.018]  Good guy, really good guy.
[00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:47.320]  Okay, let's get serious now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:49.126 --> 00:02:49.306]  And, uh...
[00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.251]  We'll be discussing that in more detail a little bit later.
[00:03:44.654 --> 00:03:45.314]  We're good to go.
[00:04:14.346 --> 00:04:17.629]  Democrat control means hate bill will pass.
[00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.251]  They will kill the fence that was never born.
[00:04:21.912 --> 00:04:26.496]  Also, I want to get into basically the mind control propaganda in this country.
[00:04:26.837 --> 00:04:27.497]  Bush Sr.
[00:04:27.557 --> 00:04:31.981]  weighs in on the evils of the blogosphere, and Bush Jr.
[00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:33.222]  Shrub wants to regulate it.
[00:04:34.523 --> 00:04:37.886]  We'll get into the PC madness spreading across the world.
[00:04:39.582 --> 00:04:41.224]  Basically, just wait.
[00:04:41.264 --> 00:04:43.626]  When we get back, I am really wound up.
[00:04:43.666 --> 00:04:45.548]  There is a lot of really important news.
[00:04:46.088 --> 00:04:47.369]  We will cover it all.
[00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.094]  And it's all posted, by the way, at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoAwards.com.
[00:04:52.674 --> 00:04:54.556]  The information war continues.
[00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:56.498]  This is your wartime broadcast.
[00:04:56.818 --> 00:04:57.579]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.391]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:07.751 --> 00:05:09.652]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.052 --> 00:05:17.714]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.394 --> 00:05:25.437]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.837 --> 00:05:28.758]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:05:29.118 --> 00:05:31.479]  The White House probing to disseminate fake news.
[00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:32.739]  NSA spies.
[00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:36.552]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at prisonplanet.tv
[00:06:02.543 --> 00:06:03.584]  The war on terrorism.
[00:06:03.904 --> 00:06:06.686]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:06.967 --> 00:06:11.130]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:12.371]  So what do you do?
[00:06:12.691 --> 00:06:17.255]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:17.748 --> 00:06:19.869]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:35.053]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:35.093 --> 00:06:42.215]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:42.515 --> 00:06:45.676]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[00:06:47.056 --> 00:06:47.236]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:47.256 --> 00:06:48.618]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:07:02.242 --> 00:07:07.663]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[00:07:08.083 --> 00:07:12.844]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:15.825]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:07:16.345 --> 00:07:19.746]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:07:20.526 --> 00:07:24.847]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:07:25.287 --> 00:07:28.467]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:07:29.067 --> 00:07:31.908]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:07:32.688 --> 00:07:34.829]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:07:34.869 --> 00:07:36.970]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:37.410]  U.S.
[00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.071]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[00:07:39.091 --> 00:07:39.371]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[00:07:39.391 --> 00:07:40.272]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[00:07:40.292 --> 00:07:40.812]  Ask for George.
[00:08:02.392 --> 00:08:08.439]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.024]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:21.053 --> 00:08:25.337]  All right, I'm going to get right into the fact that Bush and the Democrats are announcing no border fence.
[00:08:25.957 --> 00:08:28.859]  Listeners of this broadcast knew that it was dead on arrival.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.880]  It was never funded.
[00:08:30.481 --> 00:08:32.663]  It was textbook smoke and mirrors.
[00:08:33.403 --> 00:08:41.530]  The Democrats are swearing to pass a total restriction on free speech with the Hate Crimes Act, similar to what they have in Europe.
[00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:47.635]  And I want to look at some of the stuff that's developed in the last few days in Europe and in England and in this country concerning speech.
[00:08:48.579 --> 00:08:49.440]  I think we're good to go.
[00:09:13.004 --> 00:09:17.427]  And then I was thinking this morning about the actual numbers of dead Iraqis.
[00:09:17.887 --> 00:09:24.072]  The British Medical Journal did an in-depth two-year study, and their conservative estimate is 654,000.
[00:09:24.312 --> 00:09:29.515]  Yeah, that's more than six-tenths of a mil dead.
[00:09:29.595 --> 00:09:35.299]  And I looked at some of the old numbers this morning, and it's actually 2.15 million dead.
[00:09:35.319 --> 00:09:36.520]  And I wanted to talk a little bit about that.
[00:09:39.652 --> 00:09:40.953]  And the stack just goes on and on.
[00:09:40.993 --> 00:09:42.534]  In fact, I did have one guest.
[00:09:42.574 --> 00:09:43.254]  I canceled him.
[00:09:43.355 --> 00:09:45.276]  And then we got another guest we're working on for tomorrow.
[00:09:45.296 --> 00:09:47.137]  A lot of big guests in the next two days.
[00:09:47.557 --> 00:09:48.338]  She'll want to stay with us.
[00:09:48.518 --> 00:09:53.921]  But it's good that we don't have any guests today because I want to go over news throughout the broadcast and take calls.
[00:09:53.941 --> 00:09:56.563]  When I do have guests, I tend to run out of time and not get to it all.
[00:09:56.863 --> 00:10:02.226]  But before I plunge into all this key information, this is going to be important info, by the way.
[00:10:02.666 --> 00:10:08.330]  I'm asking you as listeners to email your entire email list and tell them about the radio show.
[00:10:09.562 --> 00:10:12.124]  Just hundreds of thousands per broadcast tune in.
[00:10:34.597 --> 00:10:35.398]  Just on the Internet.
[00:10:35.458 --> 00:10:37.560]  That's just one little small sampling there.
[00:10:38.081 --> 00:10:39.082]  And I'm very proud of that.
[00:10:39.142 --> 00:10:45.790]  But what would happen if all of you out there emailed your entire email list, went on message boards.
[00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:47.431]  I mean, I'm risking my life here.
[00:10:47.832 --> 00:10:48.653]  I'm walking point.
[00:10:48.953 --> 00:10:50.235]  I'm ready to go down with the ship.
[00:10:50.375 --> 00:10:52.217]  I'm ready to hit the barbed wire.
[00:10:52.317 --> 00:10:53.358]  I am hitting the barbed wire.
[00:10:53.418 --> 00:10:53.919]  I'm happy.
[00:10:54.239 --> 00:10:54.760]  I'm honored.
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:56.081]  I think we're good to go.
[00:11:16.207 --> 00:11:17.147]  In this info war.
[00:11:17.667 --> 00:11:18.608]  That's what it's all about.
[00:11:18.628 --> 00:11:21.648]  That's why I put Terror Storm out for free on Google Video.
[00:11:21.948 --> 00:11:24.069]  Last time I looked, over 6 million views.
[00:11:24.109 --> 00:11:33.091]  If you add up all the different versions that are up there on Google Video together, we have no idea how many on the share networks and the torrents and all the other ways that videos are shared.
[00:11:33.211 --> 00:11:38.172]  Millions of copies we know from the thousands of you that have gotten them have gotten out to the people.
[00:11:38.392 --> 00:11:40.992]  That's another effective way with the DVDs and the VHS.
[00:11:42.232 --> 00:11:44.513]  And so please continue with that activism.
[00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:55.402]  I talked in the last segment about watching a video that's up on prisonplanet.com of John Connor, the Resistance Manifesto, and we should all do what he does.
[00:11:55.442 --> 00:12:08.511]  That's what I've been doing for 12 years, calling into talk radio shows, being guests on talk radio shows, going up and confronting prominent people, but just walking into a major university, which you can do, and just walking into the
[00:12:10.632 --> 00:12:13.594]  You know, big auditoriums where some of these classes, there's 500 people.
[00:12:13.614 --> 00:12:14.714]  Looks like the one he's in has got about 400, 500.
[00:12:15.174 --> 00:12:19.676]  And he just starts saying, 9-11's an inside job, Operation Northwoods, Google it.
[00:12:19.957 --> 00:12:23.218]  And he handed out 1,000 copies of Loose Change that the Loose Change boys gave him.
[00:12:24.499 --> 00:12:26.300]  That's the kind of stuff we need to see.
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.081]  That's the type of action we need to see.
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:36.883]  And, again, so the easy thing to do is to email your whole email list on a weekly basis and say, hey, tune into Alex Jones.
[00:12:36.923 --> 00:12:37.783]  He was talking about this.
[00:12:38.063 --> 00:12:39.424]  Hey, learn about the North American Union.
[00:12:39.644 --> 00:12:42.685]  Hey, learn about cancer viruses and sodium and stannous fluoride in your water.
[00:12:43.065 --> 00:12:44.746]  Hey, learn about mercury and the vaccines.
[00:12:45.186 --> 00:12:48.227]  Hey, learn about how they killed our troops with nerve gas, our own government.
[00:12:48.267 --> 00:12:51.129]  Hey, go to Infowars.com.
[00:12:51.169 --> 00:12:52.169]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:12:53.104 --> 00:12:55.147]  I mean, we are having a huge effect.
[00:12:55.227 --> 00:12:56.529]  We are growing exponentially.
[00:12:56.569 --> 00:12:57.911]  The Patriot Movement, the Truth Movement.
[00:12:58.171 --> 00:12:59.733]  But it isn't fast enough.
[00:12:59.753 --> 00:13:01.716]  So I'm asking you to be activists.
[00:13:02.077 --> 00:13:03.218]  To go on message boards.
[00:13:03.238 --> 00:13:04.520]  To go on MySpace accounts.
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.002]  To get aggressive.
[00:13:06.062 --> 00:13:06.623]  It's fun.
[00:13:07.446 --> 00:13:09.868]  And just go plant the seeds like Johnny Appleseed.
[00:13:10.408 --> 00:13:11.689]  Fire and forget, folks.
[00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:13.791]  She can destroy the New World Order.
[00:13:14.371 --> 00:13:16.013]  Literally, you are info warriors.
[00:13:16.053 --> 00:13:26.401]  I mean, envision yourself going over the enemy wire, going in at night, and again, this is an analogy of the info war, putting that C4 explosive on their fuel tanks.
[00:13:26.921 --> 00:13:35.987]  I mean, that's what happens when you fire out mass emails, when you go on message boards, when you expose Northwoods, when you expose 9-11, when you give them a link to Terror Storm on Google Video.
[00:13:36.187 --> 00:13:42.211]  You're literally then escaping over the line, getting back into the woods, ammo dumps exploding.
[00:13:43.132 --> 00:13:44.793]  You know, we're crushing these scum.
[00:13:44.813 --> 00:13:47.195]  They're getting more and more scared.
[00:13:48.308 --> 00:13:54.375]  In fact, that's why they're not killing a lot of the leaders of this movement, because there's too many of us now, and we're just spawning more and more.
[00:13:54.635 --> 00:13:55.436]  It's viral.
[00:13:55.456 --> 00:14:03.345]  We're going into their cell structures and planting our DNA of truth, taking over their cellular structures, ordering them to mass produce the truth.
[00:14:03.545 --> 00:14:06.509]  The cells burst and outpour millions more.
[00:14:07.692 --> 00:14:09.594]  We are going to crush the new world order.
[00:14:10.014 --> 00:14:11.395]  We're coming for the scum.
[00:14:11.616 --> 00:14:13.237]  We're going to defeat them with God's help.
[00:14:13.837 --> 00:14:16.700]  Oh, they'll set up their world government for a brief time, but it will fall.
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:17.661]  It will fail.
[00:14:18.021 --> 00:14:20.063]  Right as it's completed, it will implode.
[00:14:20.323 --> 00:14:21.604]  You can already see it happening.
[00:14:22.925 --> 00:14:24.406]  And yes, I'm a maniac.
[00:14:24.446 --> 00:14:25.888]  I'm a maniac for freedom.
[00:14:26.248 --> 00:14:27.069]  I'm in a war.
[00:14:27.129 --> 00:14:27.909]  I'm hyped up.
[00:14:27.989 --> 00:14:28.890]  I'm fired up.
[00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:30.832]  I've got my head screwed on straight.
[00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:34.011]  So let's get our heads screwed on straight today.
[00:14:34.051 --> 00:14:38.734]  And then lastly, call to arms, call to the troops in the Infowar here.
[00:14:41.396 --> 00:14:57.226]  You need to understand that it is so important that Terror Storm got a number one on Amazon.com because that is the New York Times bestseller list of videos in the industry.
[00:14:59.036 --> 00:15:02.998]  Now, we got to number 9, number 8, what, a week and a half ago.
[00:15:03.038 --> 00:15:04.759]  It stayed in the top 100 for over a week.
[00:15:05.419 --> 00:15:08.200]  Then when they sold out, it plunged to like 250.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.801]  I saw it at 300, saw it at 200.
[00:15:09.861 --> 00:15:11.622]  I'm just saying 250.
[00:15:13.143 --> 00:15:17.485]  Well, just a day after they were back in stock, and they tell you when they're in stock.
[00:15:19.626 --> 00:15:23.187]  Just a day after they got back in stock, and they were really in stock the whole time.
[00:15:23.227 --> 00:15:24.988]  I don't know why they lied and didn't do that.
[00:15:25.028 --> 00:15:26.549]  We had the records, but whatever.
[00:15:28.318 --> 00:15:30.399]  They were saying four to six weeks, everybody quit buying it.
[00:15:32.121 --> 00:15:35.724]  And so we bottomed out at number eight and then plunged back when they sold out.
[00:15:37.626 --> 00:15:39.147]  Again, they never sold out.
[00:15:39.167 --> 00:15:39.968]  It was delivered to them.
[00:15:40.208 --> 00:15:41.169]  We had the receipt of it.
[00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:46.334]  But it took them a week to put it in their system that they had it, which is unheard of, by the way.
[00:15:46.794 --> 00:15:47.795]  We think it was done on purpose.
[00:15:48.393 --> 00:15:49.894]  Because it upsets people, folks.
[00:15:50.294 --> 00:15:51.515]  We were going to get number one.
[00:15:51.956 --> 00:16:00.502]  I just want to get number one one time, because to be able to say to all the big stores, which they just ordered a few copies apiece, to be able to say it's number one.
[00:16:00.802 --> 00:16:02.243]  One thing is to say number eight or number nine.
[00:16:02.624 --> 00:16:04.505]  We've got screenshots of it at 17 and 16.
[00:16:04.965 --> 00:16:06.667]  We weren't up at 1 a.m.
[00:16:06.687 --> 00:16:08.128]  to, I guess, get screenshots.
[00:16:08.188 --> 00:16:09.148]  I was out at the farm.
[00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:12.791]  I frankly don't know how to do a screenshot on a PC.
[00:16:12.831 --> 00:16:13.332]  I'm an idiot.
[00:16:13.472 --> 00:16:14.132]  My people know how.
[00:16:14.152 --> 00:16:15.033]  I know how to do it on a Mac.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.421]  It's more complex on the PC.
[00:16:17.642 --> 00:16:21.988]  But the point is, we want to push it to number uno.
[00:16:22.989 --> 00:16:23.950]  Numero uno.
[00:16:24.972 --> 00:16:26.193]  And then I'll shut up about it.
[00:16:26.854 --> 00:16:27.756]  For some reason, it was $11.19.
[00:16:27.836 --> 00:16:28.617]  Amazon raised it to $12.19.
[00:16:28.697 --> 00:16:29.238]  But who cares?
[00:16:34.014 --> 00:16:35.335]  And again, this is not about money.
[00:16:35.435 --> 00:16:37.016]  I put it up for free on Google Video.
[00:16:37.396 --> 00:16:41.878]  This is about setting a standard and being able to say number one.
[00:16:42.319 --> 00:16:45.981]  Number one on the New York Times bestseller list of video.
[00:16:46.461 --> 00:16:48.322]  There is no debating it in the industry.
[00:16:48.682 --> 00:16:49.703]  That is the standard.
[00:16:50.143 --> 00:16:52.124]  It's already caused a huge wave.
[00:16:52.564 --> 00:16:55.106]  More stores to order it nationwide than it went into the top ten.
[00:16:55.586 --> 00:16:58.087]  Let's send it to number one.
[00:16:59.548 --> 00:17:03.210]  I'm asking you to send it to number one.
[00:17:04.913 --> 00:17:07.015]  Okay, it's my first video to ever be distributed.
[00:17:07.675 --> 00:17:11.458]  I turned out other distributors because I didn't like their terms and they wanted to be able to control it.
[00:17:11.978 --> 00:17:17.443]  My new distributor that put out Outfoxed and, you know, the book based, the movie Syriana was based on.
[00:17:17.463 --> 00:17:18.904]  I mean, they're a big outfit.
[00:17:19.724 --> 00:17:22.046]  Zero censorship, total anti-New World Order.
[00:17:22.927 --> 00:17:25.629]  Gary Badley, the owner, sheathes against the New World Order.
[00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:27.810]  I've had dinner with him, know him privately.
[00:17:28.551 --> 00:17:32.334]  And so we're both seething here in a war mentality, attacking the enemy.
[00:17:33.207 --> 00:17:37.868]  It's like the folks at the Green Dragon Inn starting the 1776, Paul Revere.
[00:17:38.648 --> 00:17:49.351]  And I just hope that you will join us in this vicious assault on the New World Order, this slathering pit bull attack on the ankle of the globalists.
[00:17:49.691 --> 00:17:51.391]  Frankly, we're hanging off their throat right now.
[00:17:52.172 --> 00:17:53.372]  And I'm just not going to let go.
[00:17:53.412 --> 00:17:54.052]  What about you?
[00:17:54.572 --> 00:17:57.313]  Please, all of us as little pit bulls, let's attach ourselves.
[00:17:57.673 --> 00:18:00.234]  Some of you may even be little vicious French bulldogs.
[00:18:00.254 --> 00:18:00.814]  It doesn't matter.
[00:18:01.334 --> 00:18:01.414]  We...
[00:18:02.722 --> 00:18:03.943]  We just need to attack them.
[00:18:04.803 --> 00:18:06.324]  Ladies and gentlemen, I like French Bulldogs.
[00:18:06.344 --> 00:18:07.305]  I don't know why I just said that.
[00:18:07.965 --> 00:18:08.546]  I want one.
[00:18:08.586 --> 00:18:09.926]  My wife says two dogs is enough.
[00:18:09.946 --> 00:18:13.889]  But the point is, we need to... The cute little ears.
[00:18:14.229 --> 00:18:16.430]  We need to attack now.
[00:18:17.351 --> 00:18:19.292]  We need to go after them now.
[00:18:20.232 --> 00:18:21.053]  And this is key.
[00:18:21.093 --> 00:18:23.174]  So you want to push it to number one like I do?
[00:18:23.514 --> 00:18:24.555]  Join me now.
[00:18:24.635 --> 00:18:25.676]  You've already bought copies.
[00:18:25.916 --> 00:18:26.536]  Go buy some more.
[00:18:26.596 --> 00:18:27.257]  Give them as gifts.
[00:18:27.737 --> 00:18:28.737]  The 12 Smackers.
[00:18:28.797 --> 00:18:29.358]  I mean, come on.
[00:18:29.378 --> 00:18:31.299]  You can hardly get a McDonald's meal for that.
[00:18:32.869 --> 00:18:35.491]  You can't get McDonald's for two people hardly on $12.
[00:18:35.971 --> 00:18:40.915]  Just go get it and give it to people and make copies of it and know you're having a huge effect.
[00:18:43.337 --> 00:18:43.657]  Okay?
[00:18:43.777 --> 00:18:47.419]  It went to number 20 and it kind of settled back to 25.
[00:18:47.579 --> 00:18:48.540]  Let's drive it.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.181]  Right now it's at number 20-something.
[00:18:50.782 --> 00:18:53.183]  Let's send it to number one right now.
[00:18:54.224 --> 00:18:57.906]  Everyone, converge now and send it to number one.
[00:18:58.667 --> 00:18:58.987]  Uno.
[00:18:59.768 --> 00:19:00.048]  All right.
[00:19:01.081 --> 00:19:05.324]  You can link through to the subsection at Infowars.com, prisonplanet.com right now.
[00:19:05.664 --> 00:19:08.906]  And then once it hits number one, I will shut up about it.
[00:19:10.287 --> 00:19:11.267]  I mean, let me give you an example.
[00:19:12.148 --> 00:19:15.950]  It's great when you buy it from Infowars.com because this office keeps all the profit.
[00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:16.831]  I'm able to pay my employees.
[00:19:17.291 --> 00:19:22.775]  I'm actually losing tons of money by telling you to go get it at Amazon.com because they sell it to Amazon for like $5.
[00:19:24.582 --> 00:19:26.663]  And then I end up getting about 50 cents after everything.
[00:19:27.064 --> 00:19:27.244]  See?
[00:19:27.644 --> 00:19:31.767]  So instead of making $10 off a DVD, I'm saying, go buy it here where I make 50 cents.
[00:19:31.807 --> 00:19:32.007]  See?
[00:19:32.227 --> 00:19:34.248]  See, I'm here saying I don't want to make money.
[00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:38.271]  I'm here saying I want to go number one so everybody gets it out there.
[00:19:38.931 --> 00:19:39.272]  Okay?
[00:19:40.212 --> 00:19:40.873]  So just get it.
[00:19:41.473 --> 00:19:41.893]  Please!
[00:19:43.314 --> 00:19:44.415]  Alright, I'm going to stop screaming.
[00:19:45.596 --> 00:19:46.816]  I want that number one slot.
[00:19:46.937 --> 00:19:49.058]  It's very important strategically in the info war.
[00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:55.578]  So that's the request here from Command Base Alpha Delta Tango NORAD.
[00:19:55.598 --> 00:19:57.941]  All right, we'll be right back.
[00:19:58.422 --> 00:20:00.465]  I have no idea what that acronym just was, but I heard it on TV.
[00:20:01.331 --> 00:20:02.412]  Ted Anderson from Midas.
[00:20:02.452 --> 00:20:03.293]  Today is November 15th, 2006.
[00:20:03.333 --> 00:20:06.115]  Gold opened at $617.10, and one-ounce coins can be purchased for $637.60 and $321.35 for half-ounce coins.
[00:20:06.155 --> 00:20:06.655]  That's $637.60 and $321.35.
[00:20:06.735 --> 00:20:13.961]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[00:20:28.832 --> 00:20:32.093]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[00:20:32.554 --> 00:20:35.995]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[00:20:36.055 --> 00:20:39.076]  However, the executive order still stands unrepealed.
[00:20:39.516 --> 00:20:42.337]  Midas has the Kennedy versus Fed document.
[00:20:42.577 --> 00:20:43.018]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:43.098 --> 00:20:44.878]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[00:20:44.898 --> 00:20:45.078]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:51.841 --> 00:20:57.126]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:57.186 --> 00:20:58.467]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:20:58.587 --> 00:21:04.652]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:05.133 --> 00:21:19.265]  Did you know that communism has stated that America would not jump from capitalism to communism, but our elected leaders would pass laws to socialize America, and one day we would wake up and have socialism-communism and not even know how it happened?
[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:24.501]  Have we seen this very type of socialization of America over the last 60 years?
[00:21:25.482 --> 00:21:30.103]  We've been pushed far down the slippery slope of socialism-communism and don't even know it.
[00:21:30.703 --> 00:21:40.826]  Just as Nikita Khrushchev said, we'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:00.996 --> 00:23:05.761]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[00:23:06.001 --> 00:23:09.984]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[00:23:10.245 --> 00:23:16.530]  As you may have heard by now, Ken Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[00:23:16.791 --> 00:23:21.175]  One of Ken's most popular items right now is the new solar-powered generator.

[00:24:24.191 --> 00:24:25.252]  Welcome back!
[00:24:51.042 --> 00:24:54.965]  I got a smile for everybody I meet as long as you don't drop a bomb on my street.
[00:24:55.746 --> 00:24:57.447]  I think that sums up my philosophy.
[00:24:58.988 --> 00:25:01.950]  All right, let me get serious and get into all the news here today.
[00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:06.193]  It's actually pretty bleak and pretty dark, but we knew what was going to happen.
[00:25:07.534 --> 00:25:16.561]  And some had said, I had even said, I had asked the question, you know, keeping the Republicans in, things will just get worse, so that will wake people up.
[00:25:17.634 --> 00:25:23.058]  But then I'd also say the Democrats are bought and paid for by the same global interest, so they'll probably just accelerate the program.
[00:25:23.098 --> 00:25:30.223]  So, you know, is it better to just let them run wild and show everybody who they are, or is it better to try to stalemate them and block them and stop them?
[00:25:31.364 --> 00:25:32.044]  And I don't know.
[00:25:32.064 --> 00:25:35.327]  I mean, I just know that duty's mine and consequence belongs to God.
[00:25:36.428 --> 00:25:37.548]  But this is how it works.
[00:25:37.648 --> 00:25:40.170]  Yesterday, the Associated Press comes out, and it was on Drudge.
[00:25:41.691 --> 00:25:43.873]  For some reason, I printed it, but it wasn't in my stack.
[00:25:45.527 --> 00:25:48.909]  And it was that the Democrats may kill border fence plan.
[00:25:50.129 --> 00:25:51.289]  You probably heard it on the radio.
[00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:52.330]  I heard it on the radio, too.
[00:25:52.850 --> 00:26:00.833]  By this morning, though, the article had been changed to Chertoff and Democrats agree to lay border fence alternatives.
[00:26:01.174 --> 00:26:09.357]  See, it's the new bipartisanship, and it says the House Homeland Security Committee, top Democrats, and Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff
[00:26:10.072 --> 00:26:19.135]  Said today, they will look at alternatives to building more fencing along the nation's borders, putting them at odds with top Republicans on the panel.
[00:26:20.595 --> 00:26:24.176]  So, you see, those are outgoing Republicans, so they don't matter.
[00:26:25.176 --> 00:26:26.757]  Those Republicans were traitors, too.
[00:26:26.837 --> 00:26:38.240]  We read the subsection of the bill on air, and it said that Homeland Security will allow the building of a limited fence in a 700-mile area.
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:40.940]  We're good to go.
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:41.721]  We're good to go.
[00:27:03.988 --> 00:27:05.469]  No 700-mile fence.
[00:27:05.729 --> 00:27:06.129]  Ah-ah.
[00:27:06.329 --> 00:27:07.890]  But we can build one around Afghanistan.
[00:27:08.051 --> 00:27:08.951]  Oh, yes.
[00:27:09.011 --> 00:27:09.772]  Thousands of miles.
[00:27:10.012 --> 00:27:11.132]  They can build one in Iraq.
[00:27:11.313 --> 00:27:11.813]  Oh, yes.
[00:27:11.873 --> 00:27:12.893]  Hundreds of miles already built.
[00:27:13.214 --> 00:27:15.135]  But you can't have one here.
[00:27:16.936 --> 00:27:22.940]  And this big cardinal down in Mexico, another cardinal at the Vatican, is running around saying it's inhuman to build a fence.
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:26.862]  Well, hey, Italy, how about we send in 30 million people into your country?
[00:27:27.712 --> 00:27:37.960]  And again, big parts of the Catholic Church are manipulating and controlling the giant Catholic majority down there, and they just want their constituents up here for the dying Catholic Church in this country.
[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:39.761]  I mean, it's sick, folks.
[00:27:39.901 --> 00:27:43.144]  Every establishment, every major group wants open borders.
[00:27:44.486 --> 00:27:46.447]  Oh, but 90% of the American people don't.
[00:27:46.727 --> 00:27:48.488]  But what we want doesn't matter.
[00:27:48.768 --> 00:27:51.469]  What the Constitution says about defending our borders doesn't matter.
[00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:53.470]  Because we're not America anymore.
[00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:54.891]  This country's dead.
[00:27:55.151 --> 00:28:04.976]  Now we can resuscitate it, but only we've got a few more years, which in the scale of time is like a few minutes in the life of a country, to shock the chest with the defibrillators.
[00:28:05.076 --> 00:28:06.236]  And if we don't, it's dead, folks.
[00:28:06.296 --> 00:28:07.497]  I mean, the country's dead right now.
[00:28:08.377 --> 00:28:12.519]  We've been totally overtaken by foreign lobbyists from China and Israel and England.
[00:28:12.539 --> 00:28:13.440]  We're a whorehouse.
[00:28:14.051 --> 00:28:15.251]  We're a joke, okay?
[00:28:15.552 --> 00:28:17.692]  And until we start getting honest about it, it isn't going to get better.
[00:28:18.453 --> 00:28:24.995]  So Homeland Security, you know, the guy who supports Israel having the fence, oh, but he's a dual citizen, so why should he care?
[00:28:25.195 --> 00:28:29.577]  You know, his country can have a fence, but as our SS leader, we can't have one.
[00:28:31.017 --> 00:28:31.738]  I mean, it's sick.
[00:28:31.958 --> 00:28:43.802]  The House Homeland Security Committee's top Democrats and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said Tuesday they will look at alternatives to building more fencing along the nation's borders, putting them at odds with top Republicans on the panel.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:55.842]  They also agree that they will make a major push in the next Congress for legislation giving the Department of Authority to distribute Homeland Security grants based on risk assessments, federalizing local communities to make sure the border stays wide open.
[00:28:57.662 --> 00:29:01.443]  But Bush and Perry and all of them lie about funding the border and all that.
[00:29:01.483 --> 00:29:04.143]  They talked about $100 million for the border in Texas.
[00:29:04.563 --> 00:29:05.364]  They talked about it.
[00:29:05.464 --> 00:29:06.424]  It's all lies!
[00:29:06.764 --> 00:29:13.225]  Well, they got, what, six cameras down there aimed at border patrol stations where the illegals don't come across, and they call that getting tough?
[00:29:15.481 --> 00:29:17.302]  So that's the kind of news I have on that front.
[00:29:17.643 --> 00:29:20.885]  When we get back, Democrat control means, hey Bill, we'll pass.
[00:29:21.586 --> 00:29:22.586]  I'm afraid so.
[00:29:23.867 --> 00:29:29.432]  And then I want to go through the type of free speech restrictions that are going on here in England and Europe right now.
[00:29:29.452 --> 00:29:38.038]  By the way, people kissing on a plane and a man putting his head down in his girlfriend's lap on a long flight.
[00:29:38.058 --> 00:29:42.561]  They're going to spend 20 years in prison apiece.
[00:29:44.654 --> 00:29:45.414]  It's freedom.
[00:29:46.155 --> 00:29:47.375]  We'll talk about that, too.
[00:29:47.395 --> 00:29:49.856]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.416 --> 00:29:52.317]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.817 --> 00:29:54.418]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.338 --> 00:29:58.019]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.601 --> 00:30:06.346]  For centuries, salt products have been known to help people stay well in body, mind, and spirit.
[00:30:06.607 --> 00:30:13.094]  Soleil Wellness is a unique company that scoured the world to find the best salt-based products to help you and your family.

[00:31:00.922 --> 00:31:06.003]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:31:06.063 --> 00:31:13.385]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:31:13.525 --> 00:31:24.147]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[00:31:24.367 --> 00:31:28.908]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:31:29.188 --> 00:31:34.174]  Unbelievably, they even remove small microparticulate from water like food coloring particles.
[00:31:34.394 --> 00:31:37.338]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:31:37.558 --> 00:31:47.369]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[00:31:47.529 --> 00:31:48.870]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:50.491]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[00:32:09.494 --> 00:32:17.918]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[00:32:18.878 --> 00:32:23.800]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Incorporated's patented methodology.
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:34.425]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[00:32:34.905 --> 00:32:37.166]  Star War technology at its best.

[00:32:39.353 --> 00:32:39.393]  702-953-0267.

[00:32:40.775 --> 00:32:41.996]  That's www.lazemedinc.com.
[00:32:42.016 --> 00:32:43.397]  Good evening, Ike.
[00:33:04.793 --> 00:33:07.795]  We'd like to report on the state of our war against the American people.
[00:33:08.375 --> 00:33:23.364]  We're mounting a sustained campaign to crack down on every American and every person of every faith and every nation and to bring them to justice.
[00:33:24.925 --> 00:33:29.708]  All missions are being executed according to plan without warning or provocation.
[00:33:29.728 --> 00:33:34.151]  Americans are being swept up in an international dragnet.
[00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:39.021]  Thousands of FBI agents are on the trail of other citizens here in abroad.
[00:33:40.001 --> 00:33:44.442]  It has everything to do with hate and evil and murder and prejudice.
[00:33:44.562 --> 00:33:45.362]  America's strong.
[00:33:45.422 --> 00:33:46.783]  Federal agents!
[00:33:47.043 --> 00:33:50.104]  We are armed!
[00:33:50.144 --> 00:33:55.445]  What would you do if you knew all the things we knew?
[00:33:55.505 --> 00:33:57.045]  What would you stand up for?
[00:33:57.125 --> 00:33:59.206]  What would you turn away to?
[00:33:59.546 --> 00:34:03.947]  And then what if you saw all of the things that's wrong?
[00:34:04.597 --> 00:34:05.818]  We're good to go.
[00:34:28.475 --> 00:34:32.617]  I see a message from the government like every day.
[00:34:32.897 --> 00:34:35.458]  I watch it and listen and call them all suckers.
[00:34:35.738 --> 00:34:37.799]  They wanted me about a summer or whatever.
[00:34:38.059 --> 00:34:39.720]  Picture me buying the scam.
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:40.940]  I said never.
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.421]  You in tune to a hard truth so just spit it.
[00:34:43.641 --> 00:34:45.322]  I'll stay committed, give it to you.
[00:34:45.342 --> 00:34:47.284]  If I lose commission, it's all a part of fighting.
[00:34:47.324 --> 00:34:48.785]  Devil saves mind control.
[00:34:48.885 --> 00:34:51.227]  And all about the battle for your body, mind, and soul.
[00:34:51.327 --> 00:34:54.029]  And now I'm hoping you don't close your mind so they shake you.
[00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:56.571]  Don't forget they made us slaves, gave us aid and raped us.
[00:34:56.752 --> 00:34:59.174]  Another push season mean another war for profit.
[00:34:59.434 --> 00:35:01.956]  All in secret so the public never seek to stop it.
[00:35:01.976 --> 00:35:04.558]  The Illuminati, Triple Six, all connected.
[00:35:04.598 --> 00:35:07.000]  So the votes, they control the race and take elections.
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:09.822]  It's the Skull and Bones Freemason Kill Committee.
[00:35:09.842 --> 00:35:12.124]  See the dragon get in every city.
[00:35:12.724 --> 00:35:14.805]  What would she do with you?
[00:35:15.025 --> 00:35:17.606]  We'll find out things we knew.
[00:35:17.646 --> 00:35:20.507]  Would you stand up for true?
[00:35:20.667 --> 00:35:23.108]  Or would you turn away too?
[00:35:23.268 --> 00:35:25.248]  And then what if you go?
[00:35:25.588 --> 00:35:27.349]  All of the things that's wrong.
[00:35:28.089 --> 00:35:29.950]  Would you stand tall and strong?
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:31.481]  We're good to go.
[00:35:53.763 --> 00:35:54.344]  We're good to go.
[00:36:12.278 --> 00:36:12.899]  We're good to go.
[00:36:43.209 --> 00:36:48.751]  So now you askin' why my records always come the same?
[00:36:48.991 --> 00:36:51.451]  Keep it real, ain't no fillers, they just keep slingin'.
[00:36:51.491 --> 00:36:53.792]  Might not have seen the glory of the coming of the beast.
[00:36:54.012 --> 00:36:56.633]  So every story, every word, I'm sayin' peace.
[00:36:56.673 --> 00:36:59.073]  See, you could witness the Illuminati body count.
[00:36:59.253 --> 00:37:01.734]  Don't be surprised, these is devils that I'm talkin' bout.
[00:37:01.794 --> 00:37:04.455]  You think a couple thousand lies mean it's the killers?
[00:37:04.495 --> 00:37:06.935]  Nigga, I swear to God, we the ones, ain't no villains.
[00:37:07.155 --> 00:37:09.596]  Or any other word that keeps the demon out of the country.
[00:37:09.636 --> 00:37:09.956]  I think?
[00:37:25.786 --> 00:37:27.867]  What would you do if you knew all the things we knew?
[00:38:04.534 --> 00:38:04.934]  All right.
[00:38:07.255 --> 00:38:09.596]  Will you stand tall and strong?
[00:38:09.816 --> 00:38:13.258]  Boy, I tell you, that song's been out for about two and a half, three years, Paris.
[00:38:13.378 --> 00:38:17.800]  But that's our own little special mix, cutting out the non-Kings English.
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:20.941]  But absolutely true what you hear there.
[00:38:22.102 --> 00:38:26.724]  So go ahead and serve the system, those of you out there listening that hate me and hate Paris and hate the truth.
[00:38:26.744 --> 00:38:27.944]  Go ahead and serve your masters.
[00:38:27.984 --> 00:38:28.945]  Go ahead and enjoy it.
[00:38:29.705 --> 00:38:31.586]  Because they treat you even worse than they treat us.
[00:38:32.463 --> 00:38:35.264]  They at least respect us and fear us and know we're not afraid of them.
[00:38:35.284 --> 00:38:37.124]  A lot of us aren't afraid to die.
[00:38:37.144 --> 00:38:39.105]  A lot of us aren't afraid to tell the truth.
[00:38:39.125 --> 00:38:40.525]  A lot of us just don't care anymore.
[00:38:41.266 --> 00:38:46.627]  We're standing up against this dragon system, and with God's help, we're going to make this dragon fall.
[00:38:46.687 --> 00:38:48.067]  The dragon does go down in the end.
[00:38:48.087 --> 00:38:51.048]  All right, I know I said we'd have open phones today, and we are going to have them at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:38:51.068 --> 00:38:51.128]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:38:58.539 --> 00:39:01.841]  I want to get your take on the fact that they're telling you they're never going to build a fence.
[00:39:01.861 --> 00:39:02.982]  They never funded it to begin with.
[00:39:03.002 --> 00:39:03.663]  It was all lies.
[00:39:05.284 --> 00:39:06.685]  And so we'll be getting into that.
[00:39:07.025 --> 00:39:16.052]  Also, now they almost passed the free speech restricting hate crimes law the last eight sessions of Congress.
[00:39:16.072 --> 00:39:17.513]  This time it looks like they're going to do it.
[00:39:20.175 --> 00:39:21.716]  And it's just going to get worse and worse.
[00:39:22.825 --> 00:39:29.289]  So I want to go over what's happening here and around the world with the police state, just on that front of free speech and what people are saying.
[00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:32.751]  And then there's just a bunch of other news.
[00:39:32.791 --> 00:39:34.172]  There is so much to cover.
[00:39:34.633 --> 00:39:35.533]  Israel and the U.S.
[00:39:35.593 --> 00:39:37.194]  are saying they may go ahead and hit Iran.
[00:39:37.214 --> 00:39:45.760]  They've been saying this for a year and a half, but still, they always say they're going to hit somebody, and then they say it, they say it, they say it, and then they finally do it.
[00:39:47.821 --> 00:39:52.084]  And then, of course, the Associated Press reported yesterday, but it didn't get a lot of traction, that...
[00:39:53.482 --> 00:39:58.863]  They found plutonium, highly enriched plutonium, in some junkyard.
[00:39:58.923 --> 00:40:00.464]  Sounds like a total setup to me.
[00:40:01.384 --> 00:40:05.425]  So we'll be going over that report as well.
[00:40:06.665 --> 00:40:17.208]  Before I do that, let me just go over the hate crime legislation briefly, just to give you a smattering of what's going on.
[00:40:17.228 --> 00:40:21.569]  In the next hour, I will spend about 15 minutes after we take some calls just getting into that.
[00:40:23.286 --> 00:40:27.548]  Democrats' control means hate bill will pass Ted Pike.
[00:40:28.048 --> 00:40:30.469]  This is up on prisonplanet.com, Pastor Ted Pike.
[00:40:31.029 --> 00:40:37.892]  For the past eight years, the Anti-Defamation League, a benign breath, has tried unsuccessfully to pass its Orwellian federal anti-hate bill.
[00:40:38.372 --> 00:40:41.673]  It has failed largely from one reason, Republican control of Congress.
[00:40:42.273 --> 00:40:51.137]  Repeatedly, Republican opponents of the hate bill, Representative Roy Blunt and Senator Bill Frist, have been able, with Republican congressional backing, to block its passage.
[00:40:52.515 --> 00:40:57.199]  With Democrats now in control, such freedom-saving clout no longer exists.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:07.467]  ADL's federal thought crimes bill, the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, which puts ADL basically in control of every local department, puts Israel in control.
[00:41:08.788 --> 00:41:10.669]  I mean, I'm just stating the facts, okay, here.
[00:41:10.689 --> 00:41:12.271]  This is foreign occupation.
[00:41:13.492 --> 00:41:16.494]  Will be reintroduced soon after January 1st.
[00:41:17.114 --> 00:41:21.258]  Since no Democrat in Congress has ever voted against the bill, it will pass.
[00:41:22.085 --> 00:41:24.986]  President Bush has said he will sign a modified hate bill.
[00:41:25.666 --> 00:41:28.566]  If he does, free speech in America will quickly come to an end.
[00:41:29.326 --> 00:41:32.527]  Well, I'm going to get Pike on, Pastor Pike, but I disagree.
[00:41:33.607 --> 00:41:39.568]  They passed the legislation, what, five years ago?
[00:41:40.748 --> 00:41:50.750]  The Campaign Reform Act, which restricted free speech and told talk show hosts six weeks before an election, I can't interview a gun rights group, an environment group, it doesn't matter.
[00:41:51.685 --> 00:41:52.986]  They told talk show hosts not to do it.
[00:41:53.026 --> 00:41:55.867]  We all just said, you know what, take a hike.
[00:41:57.228 --> 00:41:58.969]  And they try to prosecute one or two of us.
[00:41:59.029 --> 00:42:00.670]  Just, you know, let us be political prisoners.
[00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:01.570]  I'm ready to go to prison.
[00:42:03.091 --> 00:42:05.052]  In fact, that's when we're going to start winning this thing.
[00:42:05.092 --> 00:42:08.434]  And that's why they haven't been killing some of us, jailing others.
[00:42:08.514 --> 00:42:15.778]  But those of us that are out in the spotlight, right out on the field, they're afraid to go up against our champions because even if they strike us down...
[00:42:16.793 --> 00:42:26.636]  You know, if we put our champions out on the field, and they send out ten of their gladiators to take down one of our champions, just the gang attack will enrage our forces.
[00:42:26.976 --> 00:42:27.956]  We win either way.
[00:42:28.516 --> 00:42:31.697]  If our champions defeat the enemy, we win, and we rally.
[00:42:31.717 --> 00:42:33.677]  Heave and rally.
[00:42:34.458 --> 00:42:35.918]  Or if they take us down, we win.
[00:42:37.098 --> 00:42:39.379]  We can't lose as long as we're committed to the fight!
[00:42:40.874 --> 00:42:41.634]  That's the secret.
[00:42:42.155 --> 00:42:43.435]  You'll just get on the field.
[00:42:43.475 --> 00:42:45.096]  You cannot be defeated.
[00:42:45.416 --> 00:42:46.217]  They're afraid of you.
[00:42:46.237 --> 00:42:48.098]  That's why they tell you, oh, there's no hope.
[00:42:48.138 --> 00:42:48.818]  You can't win.
[00:42:49.118 --> 00:42:50.038]  Oh, you have no power.
[00:42:50.199 --> 00:42:53.400]  Because their knees are knocking.
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:55.041]  Their teeth are chattering.
[00:42:55.681 --> 00:42:56.822]  And they should be afraid.
[00:42:58.403 --> 00:43:00.924]  We need courage to virally spread.
[00:43:00.964 --> 00:43:03.885]  We need manhood to spring in the heart of men again.
[00:43:03.925 --> 00:43:05.266]  We need to stand tall.
[00:43:12.014 --> 00:43:12.675]  It goes on.
[00:43:14.376 --> 00:43:19.139]  Unless, that is, there arises an upheaval of protest from American people, how can that happen?
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:19.860]  Answer alternative.
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:22.622]  Right-wing talk radio has helped make it happen before.
[00:43:23.062 --> 00:43:23.943]  It can do so again.
[00:43:23.963 --> 00:43:26.165]  Well, I call it libertarian talk radio, really.
[00:43:26.385 --> 00:43:28.787]  What you call right-wing was pushing for these laws.
[00:43:29.367 --> 00:43:30.548]  The Sean Hannity's of the world.
[00:43:31.849 --> 00:43:34.631]  He said all militias should be arrested and every child should be given a chip.
[00:43:34.651 --> 00:43:35.652]  I mean, I have them on video, folks.
[00:43:35.672 --> 00:43:36.433]  These people are fruits.
[00:43:37.654 --> 00:43:38.074]  Spreading.
[00:43:40.416 --> 00:43:53.380]  The net of thought crimes laws today in Canada and California to Europe and Australia, ADL-inspired, and they do, they go consultant at the laws, thought crime laws, are stripping nations of free speech in Canada and many European countries.
[00:43:54.021 --> 00:44:02.243]  It is a crime punishable by heavy fines and even imprisonment to make use of the Internet to criticize federally protected groups such as homosexuals and Muslims.
[00:44:02.303 --> 00:44:03.704]  Now, let's get something straight.
[00:44:06.585 --> 00:44:09.706]  I don't hate Muslims, and I don't hate homosexuals.
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:13.080]  And I don't hate any other group.
[00:44:13.461 --> 00:44:21.203]  But I will fight to the death for neocons, but it will always be selectively enforced, to say, nuke Iraq, kill all the Muslims.
[00:44:21.483 --> 00:44:22.823]  That's all going to be allowed to happen.
[00:44:24.503 --> 00:44:25.083]  In this country.
[00:44:25.124 --> 00:44:25.864]  In Europe, it isn't.
[00:44:25.884 --> 00:44:26.424]  They arrest you.
[00:44:26.444 --> 00:44:31.965]  If you just say you don't like Arabs, you're arrested, folks.
[00:44:31.985 --> 00:44:34.746]  In fact, Paul wrote an article, Paul Watson, yesterday, detailing dozens...
[00:44:36.016 --> 00:44:43.418]  I think it was like 15 examples, mainstream, where somebody just says, oh, I believe farmers deserve the same rights as gays, and they're arrested.
[00:44:44.558 --> 00:44:46.818]  He said homosexual, and they said that word is derogatory.
[00:44:47.098 --> 00:44:49.999]  When it's heterosexual, it's a scientific term.
[00:44:51.319 --> 00:44:57.060]  And make no mistake, you know, remember what happened in Philadelphia, the Christians being arrested for praying on a street corner?
[00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:57.780]  Praying!
[00:44:59.521 --> 00:45:01.081]  They were facing 47 years in prison.
[00:45:01.541 --> 00:45:02.381]  This is here.
[00:45:03.822 --> 00:45:05.662]  And the ADL was driving that whole deal.
[00:45:06.368 --> 00:45:07.589]  It's a terrorist organization.
[00:45:07.609 --> 00:45:10.452]  They've been sued and lost, and they terrorize people.
[00:45:10.532 --> 00:45:13.335]  It is a foreign intelligence arm.
[00:45:14.096 --> 00:45:20.402]  And again, folks, I was exposing Chinese infiltration in the 90s, and I'm exposing Israeli infiltration now.
[00:45:20.482 --> 00:45:23.085]  It's a real thing, and it's scary, folks.
[00:45:24.586 --> 00:45:26.328]  We've got mafias running our cops.
[00:45:26.368 --> 00:45:29.231]  They already run most of the departments, give them the handbooks, the training.
[00:45:30.532 --> 00:45:34.933]  They're the ones writing the stuff that land rights activists are terrorists, homeschoolers are terrorists.
[00:45:34.953 --> 00:45:36.214]  I mean, I have the actual manuals.
[00:45:36.274 --> 00:45:37.214]  I mean, this is happening.
[00:45:38.915 --> 00:45:40.055]  This is happening, folks.
[00:45:41.855 --> 00:45:42.936]  And we're in trouble.
[00:45:45.577 --> 00:45:51.578]  Atop Canadian hate laws, senior policy advisor recently described the power of his country's hate speech crime tribunal courts.
[00:45:51.598 --> 00:45:54.379]  The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal is a quasi-judicial body.
[00:45:54.659 --> 00:45:56.640]  It could force a website to shut down.
[00:45:57.734 --> 00:46:02.480]  Or risk $10,000, $20,000 fine in extreme cases if one ignores the tribunal.
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:09.029]  One can be tried in a federal court of contempt, risking a nine-month jail sentence for the first time offense.
[00:46:10.785 --> 00:46:12.446]  And that's a quote out of the Jewish Tribune.
[00:46:13.026 --> 00:46:24.770]  English-Turkish cyber-hate expert Professor Yaman Akdeniz, speaking at B'nai B'rith Conference on how to end dissent on the net, rejoices that David Irving is behind bars.
[00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:32.112]  He said continental European countries such as Denmark and Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland, Hungary, Austria, and Belgium have strong anti-hate laws.
[00:46:32.692 --> 00:46:39.975]  And again, whether you think 6 million Jews died, 10 million, 100 million, or 2 million, it's your right to say it.
[00:46:40.055 --> 00:46:42.036]  Well, not anymore in this country have they passed this.
[00:46:42.876 --> 00:46:45.017]  Now, let me show you what else is happening, okay?
[00:46:45.077 --> 00:46:48.918]  I could spend all day on this, and we're going to do more this week on it.
[00:46:48.938 --> 00:46:49.999]  We'll do a whole hour on it.
[00:46:51.019 --> 00:46:52.520]  But let me get into this now.
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.341]  There's a long article Paul wrote.
[00:46:55.441 --> 00:46:56.481]  He wrote two yesterday.
[00:46:59.802 --> 00:47:01.143]  He wrote one about...
[00:47:02.811 --> 00:47:14.995]  How, in England, a soccer coach said that there's horrible refs, and they've got token women refs out here who don't have the proper training, and it's just horrible, and so they're talking about arresting him, firing him right now.
[00:47:15.555 --> 00:47:24.338]  I mean, I thought in England, the birthplace of modern free speech in Europe, 1215, boys and girls, Magna Carta, that, no, it's not there.
[00:47:24.958 --> 00:47:32.260]  I mean, every day I see articles in England where some columnist, you know, says they should quit recruiting, you know, in the schools.
[00:47:32.992 --> 00:47:33.552]  We're good to go.
[00:47:33.572 --> 00:47:34.132]  We're good to go.
[00:47:54.895 --> 00:47:56.436]  I mean, they're not playing around, folks.
[00:47:56.456 --> 00:47:59.158]  And again, that's the start for secret police for what you say.
[00:47:59.558 --> 00:48:08.684]  Now they're pushing in Europe to ban saying 9-11's an inside job, claiming that it's hateful, and claiming that the speech is all against Israel, so it's anti-Jewish.
[00:48:09.725 --> 00:48:14.408]  But then saying anything about 9-11, period, even if you don't believe Israel ran the attacks, I don't.
[00:48:16.389 --> 00:48:17.670]  Military industrial complex did.
[00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:18.511]  Israel was involved.
[00:48:18.931 --> 00:48:21.493]  Boom, folks, you get off a plane in Europe, boom, you go to jail.
[00:48:21.513 --> 00:48:23.134]  I mean, this is freedom.
[00:48:25.269 --> 00:48:25.810]  Bush Sr.
[00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:29.572]  has said that the Internet is run by terrorists, that there's this hate speech that's got to be restricted.
[00:48:29.612 --> 00:48:38.219]  Well, now Daddy Bush, we got the clip, we'll play it later, chimed in on Fox News saying it's the Internet that's caused this evil climate of hate and it's got to be stopped.
[00:48:43.082 --> 00:48:46.585]  London Guardian reports press freedom being eaten away, says Watchdog Chief.
[00:48:46.625 --> 00:48:48.666]  Reporters are getting restricted all over the Western world.
[00:48:48.986 --> 00:48:49.607]  Here's another one.
[00:48:50.914 --> 00:48:52.256]  The nursery rhyme police.
[00:48:52.336 --> 00:48:54.438]  Parents to take lessons in reading and singing.
[00:48:54.818 --> 00:48:57.401]  You see, now in England, and I've got... In fact, where did it go?
[00:48:57.561 --> 00:48:59.143]  They brought it in to me yesterday.
[00:48:59.163 --> 00:49:00.665]  It was mailed to me from England.
[00:49:01.311 --> 00:49:02.332]  It was in here in my stack.
[00:49:02.372 --> 00:49:19.325]  It was a print-off given that the police come on the buses and say any antisocial behavior, any cussing, any flatulence, any spitting, if somebody's rude to you, give us their name, or when you get off the bus, report them to us, and we'll go ahead and bring them in for questioning.
[00:49:19.565 --> 00:49:22.347]  See, it's just getting everybody used to, oh, we just take you in.
[00:49:22.728 --> 00:49:23.508]  We just take you in.
[00:49:23.548 --> 00:49:24.429]  In fact, where did that go?
[00:49:24.449 --> 00:49:25.670]  I want to do an article on that.
[00:49:27.591 --> 00:49:28.252]  That's a problem.
[00:49:28.272 --> 00:49:29.493]  I just wallow in this stuff.
[00:49:31.093 --> 00:49:32.194]  I had it here in the stack.
[00:49:34.276 --> 00:49:36.859]  But see, it's not just hate speech now.
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:42.024]  Parents could be forced to go to special classes to learn to sing to their children.
[00:49:42.064 --> 00:49:48.471]  Nursery rhymes minister said, those who fail to read stories or sing to their youngsters threaten their children's future, and the state must put them right.
[00:49:48.531 --> 00:49:53.196]  Children's minister Beverly Hughes said, the children's well-being is at risk unless we actually declare it.
[00:49:53.866 --> 00:49:58.548]  And so they're now going to start spying on parents, and everyone in England will get CPS visits.
[00:49:58.568 --> 00:49:59.528]  This is already starting here.
[00:49:59.548 --> 00:50:07.171]  And then they will address, and everyone has a social worker, who statistically in England and in Australia and the U.S.
[00:50:07.211 --> 00:50:07.952]  are all the same.
[00:50:08.332 --> 00:50:10.493]  It's meant to break up families and their own documents.
[00:50:10.993 --> 00:50:13.874]  But, I mean, think about how chilling this is.
[00:50:15.054 --> 00:50:18.896]  Oh, we're going to come into your house, and now under new freedom it says the same thing.
[00:50:20.663 --> 00:50:24.184]  Four years age to 18 years of age, you all get psychological evaluations.
[00:50:25.165 --> 00:50:27.305]  Now in Illinois, they make all the pregnant women do it.
[00:50:27.365 --> 00:50:29.646]  It doesn't matter if you're 45 years old or 20.
[00:50:30.806 --> 00:50:33.988]  Now, if you put your kid in Head Start, you get three CPS visits.
[00:50:34.068 --> 00:50:34.568]  You don't know.
[00:50:34.828 --> 00:50:35.648]  Oh, you're here to help me.
[00:50:35.708 --> 00:50:36.168]  Open the door.
[00:50:36.228 --> 00:50:36.508]  Boom.
[00:50:36.788 --> 00:50:37.369]  Dirty plate.
[00:50:37.409 --> 00:50:38.189]  Your kids are gone.
[00:50:38.209 --> 00:50:47.292]  A week later, they're being raped by CPS workers or being given Ritalin Prozac or being shipped off to a
[00:50:48.092 --> 00:50:49.993]  A medical experimentation facility.
[00:50:50.453 --> 00:50:51.133]  I'm not joking.
[00:50:51.253 --> 00:50:52.254]  We're in hell on earth.
[00:50:52.534 --> 00:50:54.415]  We're in hell right now.
[00:50:54.875 --> 00:50:57.136]  We are just surrounded by scum.
[00:50:58.096 --> 00:50:58.756]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:58.796 --> 00:51:00.197]  I haven't scratched the surface.
[00:51:04.359 --> 00:51:04.839]  It's here.
[00:51:05.019 --> 00:51:09.801]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.181 --> 00:51:17.804]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.522 --> 00:51:25.566]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:25.966 --> 00:51:37.392]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.692 --> 00:51:41.214]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.675 --> 00:51:43.576]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:43.936 --> 00:51:47.758]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.298 --> 00:52:06.262]  Now you can bring Berkey purification power anywhere with the Sport Berkey filtration bottle.
[00:52:06.582 --> 00:52:12.006]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[00:52:12.046 --> 00:52:16.350]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[00:52:16.690 --> 00:52:19.692]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[00:52:20.012 --> 00:52:23.455]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[00:52:23.775 --> 00:52:33.125]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkeys patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:52:33.385 --> 00:52:36.889]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[00:52:37.129 --> 00:52:44.237]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[00:53:00.615 --> 00:53:08.563]  For years, you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[00:53:09.023 --> 00:53:12.186]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?
[00:53:12.566 --> 00:53:15.609]  The answer is high quality and huge selection.
[00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:20.814]  Just visit HerbalHealer.com and shop online or request a free catalog.
[00:53:21.255 --> 00:53:23.597]  You're bound to find the alternative you're looking for.
[00:53:24.324 --> 00:53:28.986]  Did you know that Herbal Healer carries the latest, safest and effective weight loss products?
[00:53:29.506 --> 00:53:35.388]  You can also count on Herbal Healer for the largest selection of safe and natural supplements just for children.
[00:53:35.708 --> 00:53:36.849]  And don't forget your pets.
[00:53:37.329 --> 00:53:42.971]  Herbal Healer even has natural mineral supplements for all your animals, including horses, cows and birds.
[00:53:43.464 --> 00:53:45.065]  Mark, Ted, Eric, many others that are patiently holding...
[00:54:13.698 --> 00:54:15.399]  The phone system holds 25 calls.
[00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:24.205]  We can only get to four of them on the board because the board's shorting out and our lordship is trying to get a new one up there.
[00:54:24.225 --> 00:54:25.406]  Okay, I'm being sarcastic.
[00:54:25.986 --> 00:54:27.547]  We're going to be going to your calls in the next hour.
[00:54:29.388 --> 00:54:29.929]  I'm going here.
[00:54:29.949 --> 00:54:31.570]  I don't want to say I'm on fire, but I'm mad.
[00:54:32.530 --> 00:54:35.032]  By the way, I counted it during the break.
[00:54:35.172 --> 00:54:41.476]  I have 14 articles about thought crime and CPS grabbing children and total micromanagement.
[00:54:42.208 --> 00:54:43.309]  There's no way to cover them all.
[00:54:43.529 --> 00:54:45.009]  And I did find a little handout here.
[00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:47.951]  Total policing keeping public transport safe.
[00:54:48.791 --> 00:54:51.853]  It says that they will be on all buses in the streets questioning everyone.
[00:54:52.853 --> 00:54:54.974]  Tells them to report things that aren't even crimes.
[00:54:54.994 --> 00:54:56.215]  They'll take people into custody.
[00:54:57.016 --> 00:54:59.457]  Any social activity will not be tolerated.
[00:54:59.477 --> 00:55:07.561]  Again, the social engineers turn our people into animals and then they turn those of us that aren't animals into prisoners.
[00:55:08.861 --> 00:55:10.142]  I've got to write an article about this.
[00:55:10.222 --> 00:55:10.742]  I just can't.
[00:55:10.762 --> 00:55:11.743]  This is out of England.
[00:55:12.381 --> 00:55:13.161]  Look at this right here.
[00:55:13.181 --> 00:55:17.302]  This is out of the London Evening Standard.
[00:55:17.962 --> 00:55:35.446]  The nursery rhyme police, parents to take lessons in reading and singing, goes on that Miss Hughes, the head of the program, said the state would train a new parenting workforce, because again, the state's now the parents, to ensure parents who fail to do their duty with nursery rhymes are found and supported.
[00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:47.182]  The call for state intervention in the minute details of family life followed a series of labor efforts to reduce antisocial behavior and improve educational standards by imposing rigorous controls on the lives of the youngest children.
[00:55:49.383 --> 00:55:54.524]  The children at the age of five in England, all children are put in a police database that started two years ago.
[00:55:55.064 --> 00:55:55.644]  BBC.
[00:55:56.484 --> 00:55:59.405]  And they're assessed each month by police officers.
[00:56:00.305 --> 00:56:02.126]  And talking back, everything is noted.
[00:56:02.766 --> 00:56:04.226]  And then they get them into the system and go,
[00:56:05.461 --> 00:56:06.301]  Poor little children.
[00:56:07.381 --> 00:56:13.183]  And, of course, when they mess with them and get them in the... It's to turn everybody into criminals and harass them.
[00:56:13.263 --> 00:56:14.523]  It's just poor children.
[00:56:16.904 --> 00:56:18.224]  And all the same stuff starting here.
[00:56:18.244 --> 00:56:20.084]  We're about three years behind England on that front.
[00:56:20.344 --> 00:56:21.685]  They're ahead of us on some things.
[00:56:21.725 --> 00:56:22.805]  We're ahead of them on others.
[00:56:23.505 --> 00:56:29.886]  The exact same programs, exact same names, or slightly different names, slight variance, are implemented in the echelon countries.
[00:56:30.446 --> 00:56:32.587]  Canada, U.S., England...
[00:56:33.527 --> 00:56:34.468]  Australia, New Zealand.
[00:56:34.868 --> 00:56:37.750]  I mean, folks, literally, I have over ten more articles here.
[00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:39.951]  I just can't cover it all.
[00:56:40.952 --> 00:56:41.512]  It gets worse.
[00:56:42.633 --> 00:56:43.653]  This is the new standard.
[00:56:43.834 --> 00:56:45.715]  GPS surveillance creeps into daily life.
[00:56:46.655 --> 00:56:49.957]  It admits your GPS phones, your GPS cars, everything's tracking you.
[00:56:50.358 --> 00:56:51.098]  Total control.
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:54.300]  Here's another one.
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:56.522]  Mid-flight sexual play lands U.S.
[00:56:56.562 --> 00:56:58.503]  couple afoul of anti-terrorism law.
[00:56:59.836 --> 00:57:08.679]  And it says, a couple's ill-conceived sexual play aboard a Southwest Airlines flight from Los Angeles got them charged with violating the Patriot Act intended for terrorists.
[00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:12.661]  No, it's all misdemeanors that could endanger human life.
[00:57:13.941 --> 00:57:14.742]  Section 802.
[00:57:15.742 --> 00:57:17.703]  And could land them in jail for 20 years.
[00:57:17.723 --> 00:57:19.523]  And then I looked up the actual code.
[00:57:19.563 --> 00:57:20.784]  It's a million dollar fine.
[00:57:21.459 --> 00:57:29.904]  According to their indictment, which you know is even hyped up, Carl Persing and Don Sewell were allegedly snuggling and kissing inappropriately.
[00:57:29.924 --> 00:57:33.206]  And when you're first going out with somebody, you can't keep your hands off of them.
[00:57:33.686 --> 00:57:37.448]  Making other passengers uncomfortable when a flight attendant asked them to stop.
[00:57:37.748 --> 00:57:38.369]  What were they doing?
[00:57:38.749 --> 00:57:39.129]  Kissing.
[00:57:39.909 --> 00:57:41.770]  Then later, one of them laid their head down.
[00:57:41.810 --> 00:57:43.091]  The woman laid her head down on the lap.
[00:57:43.852 --> 00:57:45.192]  My wife's done that on buses.
[00:57:45.473 --> 00:57:48.794]  And they walked up, and it says they were observed.
[00:57:48.954 --> 00:57:49.735]  This is the indictment.
[00:57:50.962 --> 00:57:53.704]  Nuzzling and kissing on the neck and the face.
[00:57:58.066 --> 00:58:03.089]  And the flight attendant walked up and got in their face, and boy, they're like little Nazis now, a lot of them.
[00:58:03.109 --> 00:58:05.791]  Either they're nice or they're just nuts, looking for trouble.
[00:58:06.571 --> 00:58:12.375]  Walked over to them, and the guy said, Hey, listen, there's going to be serious consequences if you keep getting in my face.
[00:58:13.455 --> 00:58:15.356]  And later asked, he meant, you know, I'm going to complain on you.
[00:58:15.756 --> 00:58:17.277]  No, no, that was taken as a terror threat.
[00:58:18.938 --> 00:58:19.999]  And they're throwing the book at him.
[00:58:21.125 --> 00:58:22.166]  I've got another article here.
[00:58:22.466 --> 00:58:24.547]  This is now going to start happening on the ground.
[00:58:24.887 --> 00:58:29.750]  You see, it's just first the airports and the planes, now under Viper teams and federal control.
[00:58:30.350 --> 00:58:31.691]  It's going to be just like the schools.
[00:58:31.731 --> 00:58:36.234]  You draw a picture of a military person, you're arrested because the picture of the gun's a threat.
[00:58:36.594 --> 00:58:40.276]  You carry a plastic Dixie knife to school to cut your lunch, you're arrested.
[00:58:41.237 --> 00:58:45.899]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.527 --> 00:58:58.167]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.828 --> 00:58:59.888]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.609 --> 00:59:01.729]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.370 --> 00:59:03.190]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.931 --> 00:59:04.811]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.831 --> 00:59:09.194]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.674 --> 00:59:13.797]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.079 --> 00:59:21.762]  Terror Storm is rocketing towards number one place right now at Amazon.com.
[00:59:21.802 --> 00:59:23.123]  Find links at Infowars.com.
[00:59:24.244 --> 00:59:26.245]  All right, I said I'd take calls in this hour.
[00:59:26.265 --> 00:59:28.587]  I have been continually covering the masses of news.
[00:59:28.927 --> 00:59:40.574]  They're talking about an Iran strike, a noob, what's happening with the dollar, what's happening with free speech, the hate crimes law, they're saying they're going to go ahead and just not build a fence that was never funding for it to begin with.
[00:59:40.594 --> 00:59:43.275]  It was a total fraud run by these criminals.
[00:59:44.476 --> 00:59:47.377]  Tom, Mark, Ted, Eric, many others, your calls are coming up in a moment.
[00:59:47.397 --> 00:59:47.518]  1-800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[00:59:54.304 --> 01:00:09.209]  But I was going over how everything, spitting on the sidewalk, life will be like it is in some of the laboratory countries that the globalists are already operating.
[01:00:09.229 --> 01:00:13.170]  I'm going to tell you about that a little bit later about Singapore.
[01:00:14.671 --> 01:00:19.092]  And I was just talking about mid-flight sexual play, kissing on the neck, kissing, you know, hugging.
[01:00:20.451 --> 01:00:23.793]  And the guy just said, look, there's going to be serious consequences if you keep yelling at us.
[01:00:24.194 --> 01:00:25.455]  Well, that was called a threat.
[01:00:25.495 --> 01:00:31.780]  Just any talking back to a god or a god's demigod, god on earth designate.
[01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:38.945]  And then another one where a guy joked and said, boy, there was no room on a flight to put the bags.
[01:00:38.985 --> 01:00:43.148]  The 67-year-old business owner just joked and said, well, where would the terrorists put the bombs?
[01:00:43.449 --> 01:00:43.989]  Where do you put them?
[01:00:44.590 --> 01:00:45.310]  Boom, gone.
[01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:48.793]  Terrorist charges under the UN, under world law.
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:54.104]  And that's out of Reuters, so I'm going to be getting in, and this all ties into it.
[01:00:54.524 --> 01:00:57.246]  Why do you think all over the world they're beefing cops up everywhere?
[01:00:57.586 --> 01:00:58.828]  There's no real terrorism.
[01:00:58.868 --> 01:01:05.473]  They are there, and they're being brainwashed to nanny you, to ninny you, to oppress you, to put you in the system.
[01:01:06.594 --> 01:01:09.236]  Huge paddy wagons being ordered by all the major departments.
[01:01:09.557 --> 01:01:10.878]  Just hell on earth, folks.
[01:01:11.767 --> 01:01:15.249]  Now they're talking about fully restraining people in police cars anytime you're arrested.
[01:01:15.709 --> 01:01:19.711]  Even if it's for not wearing a seatbelt, you'll be fully strapped down and tied down in the back.
[01:01:20.151 --> 01:01:22.132]  Just total, total oppression.
[01:01:22.432 --> 01:01:24.773]  High tech is as bad as you can imagine.
[01:01:25.114 --> 01:01:27.575]  Can't leave the country without Homeland Security authorization.
[01:01:27.975 --> 01:01:30.076]  Chips in the passports.
[01:01:30.945 --> 01:01:31.606]  We're good to go.
[01:01:47.004 --> 01:02:13.512]  Increasing poisons in the water, just total control, forced drugging everywhere, foreign troops on the streets of America, openly Northcom announced it three weeks ago, abolishing the governors, abolishing Posse Comitatus, abolish the Bill of Rights, Democrats wallowing, total open borders, North American Union, every major road, toll roads, tracking everywhere you go, total taxation, when you can't pay for your kids, they're going to come and take them, just bringing you to your knees, total world government!
[01:02:14.012 --> 01:02:16.174]  Thumb scanning to buy and sell is the next step.
[01:02:16.534 --> 01:02:17.855]  Retina scanning everywhere.
[01:02:17.935 --> 01:02:19.116]  National ID cards.
[01:02:19.376 --> 01:02:20.537]  National sales tax.
[01:02:20.617 --> 01:02:22.638]  Integrated with the national income tax.
[01:02:22.958 --> 01:02:23.819]  Just everything.
[01:02:23.879 --> 01:02:25.580]  It's all coming together right now.
[01:02:27.442 --> 01:02:28.562]  This is how bad it is.
[01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:29.023]  Okay?
[01:02:29.663 --> 01:02:30.864]  You cannot address.
[01:02:30.904 --> 01:02:32.145]  You cannot assess.
[01:02:32.885 --> 01:02:37.909]  It's like looking at... It's trying to describe to somebody a Vincent Van Gogh painting.
[01:02:37.949 --> 01:02:41.872]  Or trying to describe to someone when you're in Colorado looking at the Rocky Mountains from a peak.
[01:02:41.892 --> 01:02:41.972]  Okay?
[01:02:42.955 --> 01:02:45.037]  You know, it's like you're on the cell phone talking to your wife.
[01:02:45.097 --> 01:02:46.859]  Well, what's it look like, baby?
[01:02:46.919 --> 01:02:47.759]  Well, it's beautiful.
[01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:49.601]  Well, what's the new order look like?
[01:02:49.701 --> 01:02:50.482]  It's horrible.
[01:02:50.562 --> 01:02:52.584]  Well, what are they doing?
[01:02:52.604 --> 01:02:54.866]  Oh, I'm looking at 50 mountain peaks.
[01:02:54.926 --> 01:02:56.627]  I'm looking at lakes.
[01:02:56.667 --> 01:02:57.588]  I'm looking at cities.
[01:02:57.628 --> 01:02:58.429]  I'm looking at roads.
[01:02:58.449 --> 01:02:59.229]  I'm looking at birds.
[01:02:59.249 --> 01:03:00.831]  I'm looking at grass.
[01:03:01.131 --> 01:03:04.374]  I mean, I'm just here going, oh, I'm marveling at the beast.
[01:03:04.814 --> 01:03:05.775]  Oh, look at it.
[01:03:06.055 --> 01:03:10.079]  I mean, every facet of human society, huge think tanks with top minds,
[01:03:10.339 --> 01:03:11.740]  Working on how to dumb you down.
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:14.381]  Working on how to turn you against your husband and wife.
[01:03:14.621 --> 01:03:16.522]  Working on how to turn your children against you.
[01:03:16.762 --> 01:03:29.327]  Planting messages to degrade the family in Disney Pixar pictures and Fox TV and all of it to denigrate, destroy, rending, total control, brainwashing the police, mass drugging.
[01:03:29.407 --> 01:03:30.408]  It's all happening.
[01:03:32.709 --> 01:03:37.471]  Proliferating weapons of mass destruction globally and then running around talking about war to stop it.
[01:03:40.399 --> 01:03:40.739]  A lot.
[01:03:40.779 --> 01:03:41.400]  We'll come back.
[01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:42.221]  Blitz through calls.
[01:03:42.261 --> 01:03:43.782]  I'm going to go quick to calls.
[01:03:43.842 --> 01:03:44.383]  Calls, calls.
[01:03:44.803 --> 01:03:51.029]  Bottom of the hour, then I will get more into the hate crime legislation, the open borders, the stacks used today.
[01:03:51.329 --> 01:03:51.910]  I'm on fire.

[01:04:10.628 --> 01:04:17.689]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.090 --> 01:04:21.030]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.

[01:06:44.183 --> 01:06:45.284]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:45.364 --> 01:06:46.625]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:01.451 --> 01:07:06.173]  Time check enslavement and dumbing down has been taken to the state-of-the-art science.
[01:07:06.853 --> 01:07:10.434]  It is being implemented through a focused lens against the people.
[01:07:10.854 --> 01:07:13.235]  Both political parties are totally bought and paid for.
[01:07:13.255 --> 01:07:16.997]  The United States is being completely dismantled right now.
[01:07:17.037 --> 01:07:18.757]  We'll get into the hate crime legislation.
[01:07:19.237 --> 01:07:22.418]  We'll get into the open borders, the end of the border fence that never was.
[01:07:23.599 --> 01:07:26.680]  It's just talk of attacking Iran, which the million...
[01:07:27.981 --> 01:07:30.944]  ...plus that died before the war, the 600 plus thousand dead.
[01:07:30.964 --> 01:07:32.385]  I want to talk about that, Iraq.
[01:07:32.886 --> 01:07:34.968]  But right now, as promised, let's go to your calls.
[01:07:34.988 --> 01:07:35.729]  I just want to mention...
[01:07:36.548 --> 01:07:37.108]  We're good to go.
[01:07:58.115 --> 01:07:58.735]  It's good to call.
[01:07:58.755 --> 01:07:59.455]  Good to listen to you.
[01:07:59.495 --> 01:08:00.216]  I've been a long-time listener.
[01:08:00.256 --> 01:08:02.956]  I just wanted to quickly tell you what happened to me recently.
[01:08:23.603 --> 01:08:31.188]  On Monday, I was actually dismissed from where I was working for trying to tell coworkers about 9-11 and how it's an inside job.
[01:08:32.929 --> 01:08:33.610]  Where did you work?
[01:08:35.491 --> 01:08:40.214]  Actually, I'm with Aerotech, which is a temporary placement or a job placement firm.
[01:08:41.034 --> 01:08:46.318]  And the assignment that I was at, or the company that I was at, was called Aegis Science Corporation.
[01:08:47.238 --> 01:08:49.660]  And I'm a chemist, so that's the kind of work that I do.
[01:08:50.379 --> 01:08:51.740]  And I was there for about a month.
[01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:56.041]  Well, last week on Friday, we went out, me and some co-workers.
[01:08:56.141 --> 01:08:57.402]  Not allowed to talk at lunch.
[01:08:57.422 --> 01:09:00.983]  Yeah, you've got to have that chilling effect here in the new Soviet Union.
[01:09:01.604 --> 01:09:02.344]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:09:02.384 --> 01:09:10.067]  And so it was close to the midterm elections were all last week and everything, and there was some discussion going on at the dinner table about, you know,
[01:09:11.762 --> 01:09:16.284]  Democrats, Republicans, and what had happened, and different opinions.
[01:09:16.544 --> 01:09:20.505]  And you talked about your opinion about 9-11 at a dinner!
[01:09:21.045 --> 01:09:25.366]  You talked in America about what 84% of Americans don't believe the official story?
[01:09:25.586 --> 01:09:27.587]  You're part of that 84% of evil?
[01:09:29.007 --> 01:09:29.447]  Exactly.
[01:09:29.467 --> 01:09:31.268]  Tell me what happened, thought criminal.
[01:09:31.764 --> 01:09:40.944]  Yeah, I was trying to tell some people my opinion and what I thought about the Democrats and the Republicans and how they're controlled by the financiers and how both sides are funded by the banks.
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:47.104]  And this one co-worker kept telling me that I was crazy, that I was just, you know, I didn't have anything to back it up.
[01:09:47.144 --> 01:09:53.808]  And I'm sure they reported on you just like the 10-year-old at the elementary school at Steiner Ranch.
[01:09:54.829 --> 01:10:01.574]  We got the report of his evil, and it said suspension and psychological testing is now needed.
[01:10:01.994 --> 01:10:10.679]  Because during the lab, computer lab, he visited Infowars.com, which they say is a horrible site, and they can't believe the filter didn't block it.
[01:10:10.699 --> 01:10:16.022]  And in front of the class, they said it was terrorist, and he was shunned and had to go.
[01:10:16.202 --> 01:10:19.183]  Oh, but see, it's freedom.
[01:10:19.904 --> 01:10:21.785]  We've got to arrest these people.
[01:10:23.205 --> 01:10:25.847]  So this co-worker, I guess they went and denounced you the next day?
[01:10:26.741 --> 01:10:56.418]  Yeah, what happened was, I just got tired of the apathy, I got tired of the arrogance, I got tired of the ignorance around me, and I finally, in the restaurant, in a loud voice, I got the courage, and I said, listen, 9-11 is an inside job, it was carried out by Alciada, look it up for yourself, get informed, know your Bill of Rights, know your Constitution, because I'm telling you right now, this republic is under attack, and it is turning into a fascistic...
[01:10:57.026 --> 01:10:58.286]  Military police state.
[01:10:58.767 --> 01:11:04.608]  These globalists want to turn this world into a hell on earth, just like you were saying earlier.
[01:11:04.628 --> 01:11:07.949]  And I mean, I just got bold and I said it in the restaurant.
[01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:10.410]  Everybody was looking at me and everything got quiet.
[01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:12.371]  And then, yeah, exactly.
[01:11:12.471 --> 01:11:25.195]  Monday, I go to work and they're like, well, the director, he called the temp agency and told them that I was no longer welcome to come back to work because some co-workers had come in and told him
[01:11:25.959 --> 01:11:30.160]  That my behavior was unprofessional and that I was no longer welcome.
[01:11:32.461 --> 01:11:36.322]  I'd like you to write this up in an email and give us permission, if it's okay, to post it.
[01:11:36.342 --> 01:11:37.402]  We don't have to use your full name.
[01:11:37.422 --> 01:11:41.464]  If you just tell the story, I'd like to post that at InfoWars.com.
[01:11:41.484 --> 01:11:53.127]  But privately, I do need your full name and stuff to vet the story and give the place a call and have them say that Mr. Mark Blah Blah doesn't work here anymore and that he indeed was let go, but we cannot tell you why.
[01:11:54.022 --> 01:12:02.547]  But, I mean, listen, they arrested Kelly Rushing, a prominent member of the community in Lyon County, Kentucky, for just giving a police officer a Ron Paul video.
[01:12:02.987 --> 01:12:06.088]  I mean, they think speeches in the well of the house are illegal.
[01:12:06.108 --> 01:12:07.929]  I mean, this is what state police think.
[01:12:07.949 --> 01:12:08.970]  That's illegal, folks.
[01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:11.911]  Look, I just want to tell the listeners, I'll finish up with this.
[01:12:12.832 --> 01:12:15.713]  These globalists, they are Luciferians.
[01:12:16.114 --> 01:12:22.477]  They want to turn this planet into a hell because their motto is this, and I truly am convinced, and I believe this,
[01:12:23.106 --> 01:12:27.247]  Their motto is it's better to serve, or it's actually better to reign and rule.
[01:12:27.547 --> 01:12:29.447]  It's better to reign in hell than to serve in heaven.
[01:12:29.667 --> 01:12:30.187]  Exactly.
[01:12:30.207 --> 01:12:31.168]  So that's what they're doing.
[01:12:31.188 --> 01:12:32.888]  They're turning this planet, and I agree with you.
[01:12:32.908 --> 01:12:35.908]  A variant of that is it's better to burn out than fade away.
[01:12:35.928 --> 01:12:36.849]  Go ahead.
[01:12:37.329 --> 01:12:38.509]  Yeah, I agree with you, Alex.
[01:12:38.529 --> 01:12:42.870]  Like you said before, that's exactly what they're turning this planet into is a hell on earth.
[01:12:43.050 --> 01:12:44.950]  Well, that's why we call it PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:12:44.970 --> 01:12:46.190]  We're not joking with that name.
[01:12:46.771 --> 01:12:46.991]  No.
[01:12:47.231 --> 01:12:48.111]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:12:49.346 --> 01:12:50.967]  I mean, that's what we're facing here.
[01:12:51.027 --> 01:12:51.988]  This is not a joke.
[01:12:52.348 --> 01:12:54.549]  And see, that's how this political correctness enforces.
[01:12:54.609 --> 01:13:00.513]  It's a chilling effect where they fire professors, they arrest people, they chastise children.
[01:13:01.094 --> 01:13:02.414]  But we're the majority.
[01:13:02.494 --> 01:13:06.597]  Again, it's that minority of cowardly scum defending this evil.
[01:13:07.077 --> 01:13:10.259]  Yeah, if you ask a question, you ask Lord Cheney a question, you get arrested.
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:12.801]  You ask Lord Bush a question.
[01:13:13.231 --> 01:13:14.472]  I thought that was being patriotic.
[01:13:14.512 --> 01:13:15.753]  I thought that was being American.
[01:13:15.773 --> 01:13:16.814]  The United States is American.
[01:13:16.854 --> 01:13:17.014]  No, no, no.
[01:13:17.034 --> 01:13:17.795]  That's Al Qaeda.
[01:13:18.035 --> 01:13:24.861]  They've said on Fox News and other places over and over again, it is Al Qaeda-ish to even question 9-11.
[01:13:26.362 --> 01:13:27.022]  It's insane.
[01:13:27.262 --> 01:13:27.883]  It's crazy.
[01:13:28.604 --> 01:13:29.885]  Let me just finish with this, Alex.
[01:13:31.946 --> 01:13:40.013]  In the end, when Jesus was facing his accusers, or they were persecuting him and taking him to trial and about to put him to death, who was the one
[01:13:40.728 --> 01:13:44.031]  Who were the ones in the end who were crying out to him to be killed?
[01:13:44.771 --> 01:13:45.692]  It was the people.
[01:13:45.752 --> 01:13:53.118]  It was the multitudes that had been persuaded by the religious fodder all the, you know, you know what I'm trying to say.
[01:13:53.138 --> 01:13:54.179]  Pharisees and Sadducees.
[01:13:54.239 --> 01:13:54.740]  Exactly.
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:56.581]  The multitudes had been brainwashed.
[01:13:56.601 --> 01:13:57.602]  They had been deceived.
[01:13:58.283 --> 01:13:59.944]  And that's exactly what happened.
[01:14:00.064 --> 01:14:02.786]  And today I see the same thing happening around me.
[01:14:02.826 --> 01:14:03.627]  It's just ignorance.
[01:14:03.707 --> 01:14:08.211]  It's just there was only one person where I worked that could give me even two of their rights.
[01:14:09.238 --> 01:14:10.619]  Nobody else could even give me two, Alex.
[01:14:10.639 --> 01:14:14.981]  Well, I'm not saying you did wrong, but I wouldn't jump up in front of the co-workers and yell in the restaurant.
[01:14:15.001 --> 01:14:16.062]  I do that when you're by yourself.
[01:14:16.482 --> 01:14:18.723]  But you took a lot of courage, and I commend you.
[01:14:18.783 --> 01:14:19.644]  I'm seeing you did a good job.
[01:14:19.944 --> 01:14:22.325]  What I would do is I would have just brought them DVDs.
[01:14:22.665 --> 01:14:25.087]  I would have been nice and said, okay, I would make it a challenge.
[01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:26.047]  Just check this out.
[01:14:26.367 --> 01:14:27.468]  I did do that, too, Alex.
[01:14:27.608 --> 01:14:30.229]  Oh, you did that, too, and they refused to watch them?
[01:14:30.930 --> 01:14:35.252]  There was only one person there that would listen to me, and he actually took Terror Storm.
[01:14:35.292 --> 01:14:36.573]  I gave him a copy of Terror Storm.
[01:14:36.593 --> 01:14:37.033]  Good job.
[01:14:37.941 --> 01:14:45.704]  Yeah, I'm determined now to give everybody... I've got Freedom to Fascism, I've got Terror Storm, I've got all the DVDs, actually, the ones that I've burned off the Internet.
[01:14:45.905 --> 01:14:47.465]  Well, I think you're going to be blessed.
[01:14:47.525 --> 01:14:50.166]  I mean, you know, we've got to go through the fire to make it to the other side.
[01:14:50.206 --> 01:14:51.727]  Alex, I'm with you, man.
[01:14:51.987 --> 01:14:53.808]  I'm your brother here.
[01:14:54.168 --> 01:14:55.589]  Well, listen, I commend you, Mark.
[01:14:55.989 --> 01:14:59.550]  Send us an email, say, to Kevin at InfoWars or Aaron at InfoWars to make sure we get it.
[01:14:59.851 --> 01:15:01.992]  Write down an account of what happens, and then give me your phone number.
[01:15:02.012 --> 01:15:05.153]  We'll take that off, but then we'll check on it in the next few days, and we'll post it, okay?
[01:15:05.573 --> 01:15:07.294]  Kevin at InfoWars.com?
[01:15:07.394 --> 01:15:09.095]  Or Aaron at InfoWars, yeah.
[01:15:09.396 --> 01:15:09.656]  Okay.
[01:15:09.916 --> 01:15:10.776]  Hey, I appreciate it.
[01:15:11.477 --> 01:15:12.738]  I read those email accounts, too.
[01:15:12.758 --> 01:15:16.460]  That way we have multiple people reading it, because sometimes we miss it in between the spam and stuff.
[01:15:17.641 --> 01:15:19.442]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ted in Arkansas.
[01:15:19.482 --> 01:15:21.023]  Ted, thanks for holding your on the air.
[01:15:21.964 --> 01:15:22.464]  Yes, Alex.
[01:15:22.484 --> 01:15:22.944]  How are you doing?
[01:15:23.104 --> 01:15:23.464]  Good, sir.
[01:15:24.085 --> 01:15:26.767]  Alex, look, I feel the same way Mark does.
[01:15:26.807 --> 01:15:27.447]  He just called.
[01:15:27.487 --> 01:15:32.070]  I mean, I kind of feel this pressure when I'm at work and I'm trying to wake people up and show them the truth.
[01:15:32.654 --> 01:15:35.958]  And talk to them about these things that are going on around us that are very dangerous.
[01:15:36.298 --> 01:15:40.323]  You're an American who thinks they can talk at work and about things?
[01:15:40.343 --> 01:15:43.627]  You're not supposed to do that in church, anywhere at work, nowhere.
[01:15:43.687 --> 01:15:45.910]  You just submit and keep your mouth shut, buddy.
[01:15:46.130 --> 01:15:48.352]  That's the kind of treatment I'm getting.
[01:15:48.372 --> 01:15:51.296]  So it's kind of like I'm not going to stop.
[01:15:51.713 --> 01:15:52.654]  I'm not going to listen to them.
[01:15:52.694 --> 01:15:54.314]  Well, listen, it's pearls before swine.
[01:15:54.335 --> 01:15:56.055]  You've got to know when to hold them, know when to fold them.
[01:15:56.356 --> 01:16:04.300]  If they're a bunch of worthless hogs that don't appreciate how you're trying to warn them of something bad, move on and wake up others in your community.
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:05.100]  That's what I'm doing.
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:06.521]  They're a bunch of sniveling cowards.
[01:16:06.821 --> 01:16:11.424]  I did that last night right into a person who does believe in our cause, and it was really refreshing.
[01:16:12.392 --> 01:16:15.155]  Out of the tens and 20 of people I've talked to about it.
[01:16:15.175 --> 01:16:16.556]  Let me tell you how you find like-minded people.
[01:16:16.936 --> 01:16:21.199]  We've got a t-shirt, or make your own, I don't care, that is $12.95, okay?
[01:16:21.279 --> 01:16:21.620]  Okay.
[01:16:22.380 --> 01:16:23.721]  We're selling them for $12.95.
[01:16:23.781 --> 01:16:25.523]  You can get them for $9.95 when you buy two.
[01:16:26.243 --> 01:16:32.508]  We're selling a t-shirt that says 9-11 was an inside job on the front, and it says 9-11 equals inside job on the back.
[01:16:33.028 --> 01:16:36.011]  You wear that shirt, brother, you're going to find a lot of like-minded people.
[01:16:36.031 --> 01:16:37.932]  You don't have to be just, oh, I like that shirt.
[01:16:37.952 --> 01:16:39.093]  Okay, that's a great idea.
[01:16:39.133 --> 01:16:39.954]  I'll be sure to do that.
[01:16:40.487 --> 01:16:42.067]  Something very weird is happening.
[01:16:42.328 --> 01:16:46.129]  A friend of mine came in and talked to me about what he'd heard on the radio the other day.
[01:16:47.289 --> 01:16:49.349]  The police had pulled over a guy in a car.
[01:16:50.010 --> 01:16:56.591]  They called OnStar, had them lock him in his car, and then they went to arrest him.
[01:16:56.851 --> 01:17:03.733]  Well, he was so angry because he was locked in his car and couldn't get out by OnStar and the police department that they had to, of course, shoot him.
[01:17:04.693 --> 01:17:05.494]  This was in the news?
[01:17:05.794 --> 01:17:06.634]  Yes, sir, on the radio.
[01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:08.011]  When did this happen?
[01:17:08.151 --> 01:17:11.373]  This happened two days ago, and I tried to call that day that it happened.
[01:17:11.874 --> 01:17:14.456]  I will get with my friend, and I will try to get more details.
[01:17:14.496 --> 01:17:18.259]  I'm not sure what the radio show he was listening to, but I can get some details on that.
[01:17:18.479 --> 01:17:19.319]  Well, we ran a spoof.
[01:17:20.490 --> 01:17:24.652]  That was done by Michael Corbin about three years ago where they do that.
[01:17:24.672 --> 01:17:29.374]  Because OnStar, we told you, the FBI and others use it to randomly listen to your cars.
[01:17:29.434 --> 01:17:30.474]  It has a microphone in it.
[01:17:30.754 --> 01:17:31.995]  They track everywhere you go.
[01:17:32.015 --> 01:17:34.296]  That's why they put it on standard so you can't escape it.
[01:17:34.316 --> 01:17:35.356]  You've got to have it disabled.
[01:17:35.376 --> 01:17:38.258]  You've got to have a technician go in and cut the wires to the unit.
[01:17:38.698 --> 01:17:41.159]  You've got to have the tracker box removed.
[01:17:41.719 --> 01:17:44.060]  And they are using it to lock people down in their cars.
[01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:45.240]  See, everything's having built in.
[01:17:45.621 --> 01:17:47.781]  All the new computers have built in microphones and...
[01:17:49.506 --> 01:17:57.188]  And cameras, and then they announce they're going to use it to watch us and listen to us, but they say it's no big deal, and again, again, it's insane!
[01:17:57.288 --> 01:18:01.629]  It's worse than 1984, and it's all going in.
[01:18:01.969 --> 01:18:05.649]  It's all lies, and they're doing these things not to protect us, but to harm us.
[01:18:06.210 --> 01:18:16.132]  You know, you're right about all the things you're talking about, and these people that call in and disagree with you without having any facts and just call the number and waste our time, you know, they're not really thinking right.
[01:18:16.172 --> 01:18:17.492]  Look, in Arkansas, we've got...
[01:18:18.382 --> 01:18:19.043]  You've locked up.
[01:18:19.183 --> 01:18:20.304]  I'm looking at the paper right now.
[01:18:20.324 --> 01:18:31.716]  November 4th, Cornell Companies, running Alexandria Youth Services, are giving people 63 shots a day of these Storazine and psychotropic drugs to calm them down.
[01:18:32.737 --> 01:18:35.440]  We've also got an article here about the altered rice.
[01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:38.523]  Our food is being genetically altered and it's contaminated.
[01:18:39.621 --> 01:18:40.662]  So what you're saying is right.
[01:18:40.682 --> 01:18:43.804]  That rice is causing major health problems and so on.
[01:18:43.844 --> 01:18:44.444]  You got it.
[01:18:44.604 --> 01:18:48.326]  It's admitted in the paper, just like you said, and have been saying for a long time.
[01:18:48.386 --> 01:18:49.507]  It's all right here in the paper.
[01:18:49.887 --> 01:18:51.088]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:18:51.128 --> 01:18:51.568]  Keep it up.
[01:18:51.948 --> 01:18:52.789]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:53.349 --> 01:18:54.410]  Ted Henderson from Midas.
[01:18:54.450 --> 01:18:55.170]  Today is November 15, 2006.
[01:18:55.230 --> 01:18:59.292]  Gold opened at $6.1710, and one-ounce coins can be purchased for $6.3760 and $3.2135 for half-ounce coins.
[01:19:04.416 --> 01:19:06.338]  That's 63760 and 32135.
[01:19:07.459 --> 01:19:20.332]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[01:19:20.832 --> 01:19:24.073]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[01:19:24.554 --> 01:19:27.995]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[01:19:28.055 --> 01:19:31.076]  However, the executive order still stands unrepealed.
[01:19:31.516 --> 01:19:34.337]  Midas has the Kennedy versus Fed document.
[01:19:34.577 --> 01:19:35.018]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:19:35.098 --> 01:19:36.878]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[01:19:36.898 --> 01:19:37.078]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:19:43.781 --> 01:19:43.982]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:19:53.752 --> 01:19:56.153]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:19:56.213 --> 01:20:07.797]  Did you know that a semi-secret organization called the Council on Foreign Relations was founded in 1921 by Marxist Colonel Edward Mandel House, who was the personal advisor to President Woodrow Wilson?
[01:20:08.517 --> 01:20:13.859]  Its objective was to capture the foreign policy section of the State Department to help direct U.S.
[01:20:13.919 --> 01:20:17.720]  influence in the overthrow of targeted nations for communism.
[01:20:18.582 --> 01:20:18.982]  We're good to go.
[01:20:37.773 --> 01:20:39.214]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[01:20:39.234 --> 01:20:39.575]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:20:39.595 --> 01:20:41.957]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[01:20:53.610 --> 01:20:58.692]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:20:58.752 --> 01:21:06.074]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:21:06.214 --> 01:21:16.837]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:21:17.057 --> 01:21:21.578]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:21:21.878 --> 01:21:26.861]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[01:21:27.081 --> 01:21:30.023]  Yeah, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:21:30.243 --> 01:21:40.009]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[01:21:40.109 --> 01:21:44.975]  Get a two-pack for only $99 or a four-pack for only $188 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:21:45.075 --> 01:21:47.318]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:21:55.427 --> 01:21:56.989]  The Biosolutions Frequency Instrument
[01:22:16.807 --> 01:22:17.727]  We're good to go.
[01:22:39.392 --> 01:22:41.134]  You cannot articulate how bad it is.
[01:22:41.194 --> 01:22:41.914]  How focused, how crafty.
[01:23:07.429 --> 01:23:07.709]  Hello?
[01:23:08.089 --> 01:23:08.829]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:23:08.869 --> 01:23:09.769]  Hi Alex, how you doing?
[01:23:37.173 --> 01:23:37.914]  I guess okay.
[01:23:38.154 --> 01:23:39.375]  God bless all that you do.
[01:23:41.136 --> 01:23:46.020]  I'm trying to concentrate everything that I have to say here within the time allotted that we have possible.
[01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:47.061]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:23:47.381 --> 01:23:56.008]  Way, way back when Waco took place, I saw helicopters storming around this place and, you know, the government surrounding this place.
[01:23:56.389 --> 01:24:02.313]  And all I could think to myself at the time, mind you, was, why don't they just go in there and get this guy?
[01:24:02.333 --> 01:24:04.335]  Why don't they just go in and shoot their way in?
[01:24:04.355 --> 01:24:06.657]  Okay, two years later...
[01:24:07.208 --> 01:24:20.191]  Oklahoma City bombing took place and I was standing in my room at my parents' house and I remember the official demolition of the Oklahoma City Federal Building.
[01:24:20.471 --> 01:24:25.493]  I had tears flowing down my face as I watched that building fall.
[01:24:25.513 --> 01:24:28.013]  Something clicked inside of me.
[01:24:28.033 --> 01:24:31.794]  Something clicked and said, why are they destroying all this evidence?
[01:24:31.834 --> 01:24:33.174]  Yeah, Veritas clicked.
[01:24:33.675 --> 01:24:35.295]  Let me go back to Waco briefly.
[01:24:37.276 --> 01:24:40.237]  Six days a week, he took about a seven-mile jog.
[01:24:40.277 --> 01:24:41.417]  He was a pretty good jogger.
[01:24:41.437 --> 01:24:42.837]  Sometimes longer.
[01:24:42.857 --> 01:24:46.358]  Out and then down, basically, to the highway and back.
[01:24:47.318 --> 01:24:50.139]  And they could have picked him up any time.
[01:24:50.599 --> 01:24:51.479]  But they didn't want to.
[01:24:51.519 --> 01:24:56.320]  The BATF has the videos in one of the films where they're talking about how they're going to get increased funding.
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:57.821]  They were going to kill kooks.
[01:24:58.301 --> 01:24:59.401]  They were going to have fun.
[01:25:00.726 --> 01:25:02.547]  And they thought they could just shoot and mow them all down.
[01:25:02.847 --> 01:25:08.611]  They got freaked out when they shot back, and they put their hands up, and then they didn't fire, and then the coward snuck off and later came back and burned it down.
[01:25:09.411 --> 01:25:10.612]  But that's how they operated.
[01:25:10.672 --> 01:25:12.854]  They wanted to have that confrontation with the cooks.
[01:25:12.914 --> 01:25:13.294]  Go ahead.
[01:25:13.834 --> 01:25:24.561]  Yeah, and Mr. Koresh himself, he went into town on several occasions, and the sheriff himself... No, they had auto parts in an auto repair place two miles outside the compound.
[01:25:25.161 --> 01:25:26.102]  And he went down there.
[01:25:26.122 --> 01:25:27.983]  They could have grabbed him at any time.
[01:25:28.672 --> 01:25:31.894]  Yeah, no, I've interviewed the now deceased sheriff and everything.
[01:25:32.374 --> 01:25:34.935]  The sheriff's deputies went out there to their shooting range every week.
[01:25:36.276 --> 01:25:41.478]  Koresh Vernon Howell, real name, was in there almost every, I mean, was in town almost every day.
[01:25:41.498 --> 01:25:42.439]  Mm-hmm.
[01:25:43.456 --> 01:25:43.696]  Okay.
[01:25:44.196 --> 01:25:45.097]  But that isn't what it's about.
[01:25:45.137 --> 01:25:46.597]  These are wannabe warriors.
[01:25:46.617 --> 01:25:51.198]  These are all flunky lawyers and accountants at the BATF who want more funding.
[01:25:51.218 --> 01:25:53.879]  The government wants to have this confrontation, so they authorize them to do it.
[01:25:54.239 --> 01:25:56.900]  And they want to go not fight real enemies, but kill people.
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:01.281]  That's why they pose with skulls of the dead bodies of the kids afterwards.
[01:26:01.861 --> 01:26:04.402]  They think it's manly to kill women and children.
[01:26:04.782 --> 01:26:05.403]  Absolutely.
[01:26:05.463 --> 01:26:08.663]  A week and a half ago, I bought your movie Terror Storm.
[01:26:08.704 --> 01:26:10.084]  It was from front to back.
[01:26:10.584 --> 01:26:10.984]  Okay?
[01:26:11.425 --> 01:26:19.891]  About the terror storm off the market, and then I saw you at the symposium in Los Angeles with Charlie Sheen, with everybody up on stage.
[01:26:20.612 --> 01:26:24.755]  I've known about the government doing all this kind of stuff way back since the mid-90s.
[01:26:24.975 --> 01:26:27.578]  And when I saw all them speaking, my jaw hit the floor.
[01:26:34.184 --> 01:26:35.764]  It's almost like reality kicked in.
[01:26:35.824 --> 01:26:37.725]  I'm like, oh my God, this is all happening.
[01:26:37.925 --> 01:26:38.145]  It is.
[01:26:38.185 --> 01:26:38.945]  I appreciate your call.
[01:26:38.965 --> 01:26:39.545]  Good to hear from you.
[01:26:39.565 --> 01:26:40.405]  I'm glad you're on board.
[01:26:40.705 --> 01:26:43.986]  Let's talk to Juriam, I believe, of the Netherlands.
[01:26:44.066 --> 01:26:44.486]  Welcome.
[01:26:45.206 --> 01:26:46.566]  Thanks very much.
[01:26:47.566 --> 01:26:49.307]  My name is Juriam.
[01:26:49.407 --> 01:26:59.008]  I'm calling in about the elections coming up next 22nd of November right here in the Netherlands.
[01:26:59.108 --> 01:27:02.289]  It's in the hands of a guy named Walter Bosch.
[01:27:02.853 --> 01:27:07.958]  And he's, like everybody predicts, he's going to be the new Prime Minister of the Netherlands.
[01:27:08.479 --> 01:27:10.641]  And this guy just used to work for Shell.
[01:27:11.782 --> 01:27:12.743]  It should be no surprise.
[01:27:12.763 --> 01:27:16.367]  Well, of course you're going to have the Queen's man running her private country.
[01:27:16.427 --> 01:27:18.329]  I mean, my goodness, she owns half the planet.
[01:27:19.156 --> 01:27:19.777]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:27:19.917 --> 01:27:24.580]  I mean, we have this guy, a so-called social democrat.
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:25.861]  I mean, that's the front, you know.
[01:27:26.121 --> 01:27:30.144]  And you've got the other parties, like the Christian conservatives, so-called.
[01:27:30.324 --> 01:27:31.665]  Yeah, the guys that take the dives.
[01:27:32.665 --> 01:27:33.766]  That's right, exactly.
[01:27:33.806 --> 01:27:35.567]  And that's happening exactly right now.
[01:27:35.587 --> 01:27:37.829]  And of course, you don't want the North American Union.
[01:27:37.869 --> 01:27:39.410]  Your people don't like anything that's happening.
[01:27:39.430 --> 01:27:43.012]  But your government, too, just says, we have men with black uniforms and machine guns.
[01:27:44.433 --> 01:27:45.494]  Shut up, slaves!
[01:27:46.252 --> 01:27:46.452]  Right?
[01:27:46.833 --> 01:27:48.294]  I mean, that's just going on.
[01:27:48.374 --> 01:27:50.035]  And you've got these so-called liberals also.
[01:27:50.195 --> 01:27:55.059]  I mean, you know, they're taking the position of, we've got to, you know, bring out global government.
[01:27:55.299 --> 01:27:56.460]  I mean, that's their position.
[01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:58.441]  Oh, it's just out in the open, yeah.
[01:27:59.462 --> 01:28:01.224]  I mean, it's very strange.
[01:28:01.324 --> 01:28:06.287]  I've written a little article about Prince Bernard, by the way, which I wanted to pitch to you.
[01:28:08.129 --> 01:28:10.831]  Send it over to Kevin at Infowars or Aaron at Infowars.
[01:28:11.331 --> 01:28:12.132]  Yeah, I'll write it up.
[01:28:13.228 --> 01:28:15.469]  Yeah, I've attended a couple of days ago or something.
[01:28:15.729 --> 01:28:16.809]  Oh, you want us to post it?
[01:28:16.829 --> 01:28:18.810]  Well, whatever you want.
[01:28:19.210 --> 01:28:21.831]  I'd love to post it on one of your websites.
[01:28:21.851 --> 01:28:22.151]  Stay there.
[01:28:22.171 --> 01:28:23.231]  I want to hear about the article.
[01:28:23.251 --> 01:28:24.812]  I don't know why it wasn't brought to my attention.
[01:28:25.072 --> 01:28:25.992]  We just don't have enough people.
[01:28:26.012 --> 01:28:30.854]  We're just wallowing in documentation and research and everything else you can imagine.
[01:28:30.914 --> 01:28:32.594]  Literally swimming in evidence.
[01:28:32.634 --> 01:28:34.035]  It's an orgy of evidence.
[01:28:34.675 --> 01:28:36.536]  The New World Order is letting it all hang out.
[01:28:36.596 --> 01:28:36.956]  Stay there.
[01:28:36.976 --> 01:28:38.476]  I'm going to let you finish up on the other side.
[01:28:38.496 --> 01:28:40.357]  We'll talk to Peter and many others.
[01:28:43.715 --> 01:28:44.618]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.119 --> 01:28:46.703]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.646 --> 01:28:50.333]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.184 --> 01:28:56.606]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:28:57.126 --> 01:29:00.428]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[01:29:00.808 --> 01:29:03.750]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[01:29:04.030 --> 01:29:10.414]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[01:29:10.474 --> 01:29:14.877]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[01:29:15.117 --> 01:29:19.480]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:22.242]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[01:29:22.262 --> 01:29:25.044]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[01:29:25.504 --> 01:29:28.046]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[01:29:28.086 --> 01:29:32.329]  attack on Iran could result in China dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[01:29:32.389 --> 01:29:33.230]  Treasury bonds.
[01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:38.133]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[01:29:38.313 --> 01:29:39.955]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:29:39.975 --> 01:29:41.956]  That's 1-888-8XANADU or 1-888-8XANADU and ask for George.
[01:29:53.458 --> 01:29:57.042]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:29:57.082 --> 01:29:57.582]  are located?
[01:29:57.783 --> 01:30:01.166]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[01:30:01.406 --> 01:30:06.111]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[01:30:06.391 --> 01:30:11.396]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[01:30:11.656 --> 01:30:17.681]  Brewing environmental catastrophes, the safest cities, the best places for solar and wind energy, and much, much more.
[01:30:17.941 --> 01:30:32.394]  Complete with 3 gigabytes of detailed information on each of 3,000 plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis to help you zero in on the best places to live.
[01:30:32.634 --> 01:30:37.258]  The ideal location for cabins and vacation homes, as well as safe and unsafe areas.
[01:30:37.538 --> 01:30:39.622]  That's 888-803-4438 to order on the web or at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:30:52.768 --> 01:30:57.631]  The Japanese have used magnetic therapy for thousands of years, and it's more popular today than ever before.
[01:30:57.831 --> 01:31:06.115]  Established in 2000, Arizona Unipol Magnetics, AUM, is the number one online source for the superb Dr. Philpott-approved polar power magnetics.
[01:31:06.455 --> 01:31:10.557]  Now offering a complete line of these fine magnetics in an easy-to-read mail-order catalog.
[01:31:10.757 --> 01:31:12.958]  No hyped-up product descriptions to waste your time.
[01:31:13.199 --> 01:31:13.939]  Just the facts.
[01:31:14.319 --> 01:31:21.684]  Unique polar-powered magnetics are designed to apply only the negative magnetic field to the body, and they're the only magnetics used in Dr. Philpott's research.
[01:31:21.844 --> 01:31:29.809]  Proven safe with over 23 years of documented research, now GCN listeners can order the polar-powered ceramic block biomagnet and get a discount.
[01:31:29.949 --> 01:31:32.030]  This is the workhorse of all biomagnets.
[01:31:32.330 --> 01:31:33.331]  That's A-Z-U-N, as in North, I-M-A-G-S dot com.
[01:31:33.412 --> 01:31:36.635]  Or call toll free to order and request a catalog.
[01:31:36.655 --> 01:31:36.916]  888-442-0449.
[01:31:36.956 --> 01:31:37.276]  That's 888-442-0449.
[01:32:08.587 --> 01:32:09.868]  Knowing is half the battle.
[01:32:09.928 --> 01:32:11.469]  Taking action is the other half.
[01:32:11.549 --> 01:32:13.490]  And we know who the murdering bastards are.
[01:32:14.210 --> 01:32:15.871]  With God's help, we're going to move forward.
[01:32:17.012 --> 01:32:22.695]  No amount of ninnying fake Christians attacking this show or telling us to stand down is going to work.
[01:32:22.715 --> 01:32:23.715]  We're going to take action.
[01:32:24.175 --> 01:32:26.477]  We're going to do as God commands us and stand up against evil.
[01:32:27.557 --> 01:32:33.160]  And to all the government employees and all the police and all the rest of you, hey, if you're good people, you go check out what we've laid out here.
[01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:34.901]  You find out it's true because I know it's true.
[01:32:34.961 --> 01:32:36.262]  I wish it wasn't true.
[01:32:36.932 --> 01:32:38.634]  And then you decide whose side you're on.
[01:32:38.974 --> 01:32:41.056]  Don't you sit there and deny what I'm saying.
[01:32:41.576 --> 01:32:44.399]  Because if you're in that point of denying it, it means you haven't looked it up.
[01:32:47.282 --> 01:32:52.887]  And I don't mean go read some straw man attack on this one little piece that's made up and then say, oh, it's all not true.
[01:32:53.287 --> 01:32:54.889]  Everything we're talking about is happening.
[01:32:55.529 --> 01:32:56.690]  And you're being used.
[01:32:57.531 --> 01:32:59.533]  You mean absolutely nothing to the New World Order.
[01:33:00.757 --> 01:33:03.838]  In fact, I've found they abuse their own people even more than the general public.
[01:33:03.898 --> 01:33:05.118]  I don't know why.
[01:33:05.398 --> 01:33:05.898]  I guess I do.
[01:33:05.958 --> 01:33:07.419]  It's a culture of fear and control.
[01:33:10.979 --> 01:33:15.701]  Take Paul, who was Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus.
[01:33:15.741 --> 01:33:16.901]  He persecuted Christians.
[01:33:16.941 --> 01:33:17.581]  He arrested them.
[01:33:17.621 --> 01:33:18.281]  He tortured them.
[01:33:18.301 --> 01:33:19.141]  He executed them.
[01:33:20.162 --> 01:33:25.983]  He was one of the big enforcers for the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Sanhedrin, the council.
[01:33:27.754 --> 01:33:33.057]  And he saw a Christian being stoned to death and just there praying to God.
[01:33:33.077 --> 01:33:36.459]  And it hit him, and he said, Who are these Christians?
[01:33:36.499 --> 01:33:37.840]  Who is this man Jesus?
[01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:44.203]  And he asked that question, and God showed him and hit him with a white light, a bolt of lightning, knocked him off his horse.
[01:33:46.845 --> 01:33:48.906]  And a lot of you have been knocked off your horse.
[01:33:49.006 --> 01:33:50.047]  Former head.
[01:33:51.992 --> 01:33:57.454]  The CIA's Foreign Threat Assessment Division, Bill Christensen, said he couldn't believe it, he couldn't believe it.
[01:33:57.474 --> 01:33:59.635]  He looked at the evidence and he was knocked off his horse.
[01:34:00.115 --> 01:34:05.537]  Ray McGovern, CIA, Ronald Reagan and George Bush's chief analyst and briefer, knocked off his horse.
[01:34:06.378 --> 01:34:08.598]  The German defense minister, knocked off his horse.
[01:34:09.199 --> 01:34:12.220]  Michael Meacher, number three in Blair's cabinet, knocked off his horse.
[01:34:13.971 --> 01:34:15.312]  So many other prominent people.
[01:34:15.933 --> 01:34:25.060]  Underwriting laboratories, chief engineer over a whole division, Kevin Ryan, looked at the evidence, looked at their own internal reports on Tower 1 and 2 and 7, knocked off his horse.
[01:34:27.862 --> 01:34:31.745]  Listen, I was knocked off my horse when I was about 18 years old.
[01:34:33.066 --> 01:34:34.708]  I was, frankly, pretty evil, folks.
[01:34:34.848 --> 01:34:35.648]  Very worldly.
[01:34:35.668 --> 01:34:42.274]  I liked to fight, liked to womanize, liked to... I got knocked right off my horse.
[01:34:43.562 --> 01:34:45.123]  My family's like, you've totally changed.
[01:34:45.203 --> 01:34:48.325]  All you do is read now and take walks in the woods.
[01:34:48.345 --> 01:34:49.966]  And I said, I've been knocked off my horse.
[01:34:50.646 --> 01:35:00.132]  And I pray, I pray that God will move the hearts of millions of enforcers on this planet and that you be knocked off your horse.
[01:35:00.932 --> 01:35:03.553]  You know, a lot of you listening aren't going to check out the facts I bring forward.
[01:35:03.674 --> 01:35:06.035]  If you believe in God, why don't you just ask God to show you the truth?
[01:35:07.596 --> 01:35:10.437]  And if you ask God to do it, if you say, who is this man, Jesus?
[01:35:10.637 --> 01:35:11.118]  Who is this?
[01:35:11.638 --> 01:35:13.099]  You will be knocked off your horse.
[01:35:15.615 --> 01:35:16.436]  If that's God's will.
[01:35:18.077 --> 01:35:19.879]  We face very serious times ahead.
[01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:22.301]  Very serious times.
[01:35:22.321 --> 01:35:23.602]  We're in very serious times.
[01:35:24.162 --> 01:35:25.323]  I've got a lot of news I need to go over.
[01:35:25.343 --> 01:35:26.784]  We're going to get back.
[01:35:26.804 --> 01:35:31.488]  I'm going to at least finish up with Uriam in the Netherlands, Rick, Peter, and Dave.
[01:35:31.508 --> 01:35:36.212]  And then everybody else needs to hold because I need to get into the thought crime legislation coming upon us.
[01:35:36.713 --> 01:35:37.754]  The big picture there.
[01:35:38.614 --> 01:35:39.956]  What's really happened in Iraq.
[01:35:40.536 --> 01:35:42.097]  Just a lot of key issues today.
[01:35:42.598 --> 01:35:43.799]  The AP claims they found...
[01:35:45.245 --> 01:35:50.007]  Highly enriched, whatever that means, plutonium in Iran.
[01:35:50.647 --> 01:35:52.087]  Not uranium, but plutonium.
[01:35:53.168 --> 01:35:55.228]  I don't believe that, but we'll get into it.
[01:35:56.129 --> 01:35:59.210]  But right now, for the next four or five minutes, Debbie Morrow hadn't been on in a week or two.
[01:35:59.930 --> 01:36:02.911]  New William Concepts, Made in America, supports this broadcast.
[01:36:02.951 --> 01:36:04.672]  Best gravity-fed filters out there.
[01:36:05.232 --> 01:36:09.453]  You buy Made in America for $100 cheaper on average than some Indian or Chinese knockoff.
[01:36:10.814 --> 01:36:12.074]  Debbie, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:36:12.394 --> 01:36:13.074]  Hi there, Alex.
[01:36:13.194 --> 01:36:14.455]  Thanks for inviting me.
[01:36:15.734 --> 01:36:16.974]  Well, thank you for coming on.
[01:36:18.075 --> 01:36:20.916]  Why don't you tell us about Big Berkey and why we need to get it?
[01:36:21.536 --> 01:36:28.499]  Well, Berkey water filters will really take the guesswork out of whether or not you're drinking good, clean, healthy water.
[01:36:28.519 --> 01:36:40.904]  And so I just wanted to invite people to call in and request a catalog or go to our website at berkeywater.com, which is B-E-R-K-E-Y-W-A-T-E-R.com.
[01:36:44.798 --> 01:37:00.401]  And see for themselves why you should take control of what you're putting in your body so that you can keep as healthy as possible and not drink the chemicals and the bad things that are in the water that they're trying to tell people it's okay to drink.
[01:37:02.761 --> 01:37:12.323]  A friend of mine calls it industrial poisoning that we get from everything that we put in our body these days.
[01:37:12.995 --> 01:37:15.697]  Especially the water that's processed.
[01:37:15.757 --> 01:37:16.177]  Exactly.
[01:37:16.297 --> 01:37:24.663]  I'd like to point out the fact that the chlorine and all the rest of the styrene, all the other stuff that's in there, it just kills all the bacteria, too.
[01:37:24.703 --> 01:37:32.027]  So you're basically like getting slow food poisoning because you're literally drinking, in a week out of tap water, millions of dead bacteria.
[01:37:32.227 --> 01:37:32.648]  That's right.
[01:37:32.728 --> 01:37:34.009]  You're just drinking sludge.
[01:37:34.449 --> 01:37:34.849]  Yeah.
[01:37:34.929 --> 01:37:37.591]  So with a Berkey, you can take that out.
[01:37:37.651 --> 01:37:39.232]  In fact, people ask me all the time, well,
[01:37:39.690 --> 01:37:42.331]  You know, do I use the filters over and over again?
[01:37:42.351 --> 01:37:46.172]  And I say, yeah, but you have to clean them once in a while because they get real slimy.
[01:37:46.492 --> 01:37:48.333]  Yeah, they do what?
[01:37:48.853 --> 01:37:49.913]  What's the new black element?
[01:37:50.154 --> 01:37:53.115]  Even a new standard to non-detectable level cuts out everything.
[01:37:53.195 --> 01:37:54.815]  Is it 10,000 gallons?
[01:37:56.656 --> 01:37:58.476]  They'll do 3,000 gallons per filter.
[01:37:58.496 --> 01:38:00.877]  So with this system, you get 6,000 gallons.
[01:38:00.897 --> 01:38:02.978]  Oh, but that's a standard with two.
[01:38:03.038 --> 01:38:05.259]  I guess I've got one that's got three, so it's 9,000.
[01:38:05.319 --> 01:38:05.499]  Right.
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.481]  Or if you have one with four, then it's $12,000.
[01:38:09.742 --> 01:38:10.963]  Oh, okay.
[01:38:11.003 --> 01:38:13.305]  It just depends on which system you have.
[01:38:13.385 --> 01:38:17.168]  And then basically every six months or so, you do need to clean them because the scum does get on them.
[01:38:17.188 --> 01:38:17.628]  Oh, yeah.
[01:38:17.668 --> 01:38:20.210]  They get real slimy even if you're just using tap water.
[01:38:20.230 --> 01:38:24.554]  You just pull them out, put them under hot water with a bristle pad, just kind of scrub them.
[01:38:24.914 --> 01:38:25.134]  Uh-huh.
[01:38:25.374 --> 01:38:25.835]  That's it.
[01:38:26.588 --> 01:38:27.649]  Very outside-ish.
[01:38:28.109 --> 01:38:33.231]  We are here, and we're answering phones, and we're calling people back if we do leave a number.
[01:38:33.251 --> 01:38:37.913]  Yeah, I just want to point out to people that I don't sell magic machines that heal you.
[01:38:38.414 --> 01:38:39.834]  I don't sell magical creams.
[01:38:41.215 --> 01:38:45.797]  If I don't endorse something, it means I either don't believe in it or I'm neutral.
[01:38:46.237 --> 01:38:53.881]  I totally believe in these water filters, and I totally know with the evidence that the water's full of every toxin unknown to man.
[01:38:54.717 --> 01:38:57.980]  And it's just time to stop drinking and take control of this one area of your life.
[01:38:58.420 --> 01:38:59.481]  And you get a big discount.
[01:38:59.521 --> 01:39:00.863]  You get wholesale prices.
[01:39:01.323 --> 01:39:02.244]  And it's made in America.
[01:39:02.324 --> 01:39:03.525]  And they support what we're doing.
[01:39:03.865 --> 01:39:05.507]  I don't know how people couldn't order this.
[01:39:05.747 --> 01:39:06.428]  You already have one.
[01:39:06.688 --> 01:39:08.329]  Buy one for your son or daughter, your neighbor.
[01:39:08.990 --> 01:39:09.971]  I've bought over the years.
[01:39:10.251 --> 01:39:11.032]  I quit counting.
[01:39:11.912 --> 01:39:15.115]  I probably bought, what, five units last year, four or five the year before that.
[01:39:15.656 --> 01:39:16.677]  I just buy them all the time.
[01:39:17.577 --> 01:39:20.420]  In fact, my parents just bought one, another one, to give as a gift.
[01:39:21.704 --> 01:39:28.648]  Well, they're such great gifts, and if you don't want to give out big Berkey, you know, give out Berkey sport bottles.
[01:39:28.728 --> 01:39:29.948]  There's a story I never told.
[01:39:30.008 --> 01:39:45.176]  My sister, who's 15 years younger than me, she and her senior trip, summer or two ago, time flies, went to, I forget, it was like New Guinea, or what's that place off the coast of Australia?
[01:39:46.036 --> 01:39:56.499]  And everybody in her group, like 50 people from her school, got sick, but her and her partner, because they partner together in these little tents, and they stay with the natives, and there's all these mosquitoes and the rest of it.
[01:39:57.760 --> 01:39:58.520]  Sorry for interrupting you.
[01:39:58.580 --> 01:39:59.360]  I'm the king of that, Debbie.
[01:40:00.741 --> 01:40:02.781]  I never told this story, I don't think, and I need to tell it.
[01:40:03.582 --> 01:40:13.765]  And I told them, I said, you better take these Berkey sports bottles, because you can't trust the water there, and they're telling them to use filters there, but that never works right.
[01:40:14.893 --> 01:40:15.153]  Oh, so great.
[01:40:44.232 --> 01:40:45.032]  I'm going to shut up now.
[01:40:45.052 --> 01:40:45.533]  Go ahead, Debbie.
[01:40:45.573 --> 01:40:45.813]  Sorry.
[01:40:46.133 --> 01:40:46.933]  Oh, that's okay.
[01:40:46.973 --> 01:40:50.354]  I love hearing stories like that because it's true.
[01:40:50.374 --> 01:40:59.198]  I mean, they really work, and it's great to hear stories of people who have done exactly what she did.
[01:40:59.258 --> 01:41:01.979]  She took it with her and then proof's in the pudding, you know?
[01:41:01.999 --> 01:41:05.460]  I'm sorry to hear that everybody else got sick.
[01:41:06.645 --> 01:41:09.589]  And, you know, so we just, you know, encourage people to call us.
[01:41:09.629 --> 01:41:13.314]  Diarrhea, vomiting, basically Montezuma's revenge.
[01:41:13.755 --> 01:41:15.257]  Yeah, that's what they call it.
[01:41:15.658 --> 01:41:23.128]  And, you know, by people calling in and placing Berkey orders, they are helping support your shortwave airtime, too, and we...
[01:41:23.766 --> 01:41:25.147]  Really like doing that.
[01:41:25.427 --> 01:41:25.767]  That's right.
[01:41:25.927 --> 01:41:30.969]  WWCR, two frequencies, day and night, six hours a day, five days a week.
[01:41:31.009 --> 01:41:34.871]  Our international outreach that we do have to pay for, I think it's like $10,000 a month.
[01:41:35.371 --> 01:41:38.152]  So it's very expensive, and you guys help us with that a lot.
[01:41:38.532 --> 01:41:39.693]  Let me get the number out.
[01:41:39.733 --> 01:41:39.893]  It's 888-
[01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:44.071]  803-4438.
[01:41:44.091 --> 01:41:44.371]  888-803-4438.
[01:41:46.271 --> 01:41:49.812]  Or BerkeyWater.com.
[01:41:50.152 --> 01:41:52.813]  That's BerkeyWater.com.
[01:41:53.113 --> 01:41:54.213]  Or InfoWars.com.
[01:41:54.233 --> 01:41:55.254]  There's a big hyperlink to it.
[01:41:55.274 --> 01:41:57.214]  You can get it off our secure shopping cart.
[01:41:57.234 --> 01:41:58.354]  We get those orders each day.
[01:41:58.814 --> 01:41:59.695]  BerkeyWater.com.
[01:41:59.715 --> 01:42:00.875]  They ship it out to you UPS.
[01:42:01.415 --> 01:42:02.416]  Berkeywater.com.
[01:42:02.456 --> 01:42:03.116]  You get a free gift.
[01:42:03.136 --> 01:42:04.857]  You can get... They've got a bunch of different stuff.
[01:42:04.878 --> 01:42:06.238]  Just give Debbie a call.
[01:42:06.258 --> 01:42:06.499]  888-803-4438.
[01:42:08.740 --> 01:42:09.701]  Debbie, thanks for coming on.
[01:42:09.921 --> 01:42:12.122]  Oh, Alex, thank you very much for having me.
[01:42:12.463 --> 01:42:12.823]  You bet.
[01:42:12.863 --> 01:42:13.443]  God bless you.
[01:42:13.463 --> 01:42:14.464]  Always good to hear from you.
[01:42:14.864 --> 01:42:20.848]  Yeah, I think I mentioned that, that my sister took some to a trip overseas and didn't get sick, but I never told the whole story.
[01:42:21.549 --> 01:42:23.730]  Of course, I was the one going, you need to take these.
[01:42:24.110 --> 01:42:24.971]  I saw a little handout.
[01:42:24.991 --> 01:42:29.134]  I was at my parents' and saw the handout on the table, you know, saying, get ready to get sick.
[01:42:29.554 --> 01:42:30.895]  We'll provide water filtration, but...
[01:42:31.816 --> 01:42:32.737]  Get ready to get sick.
[01:42:32.797 --> 01:42:33.557]  Everyone does.
[01:42:33.617 --> 01:42:34.337]  It's okay.
[01:42:34.377 --> 01:42:35.038]  Well, they didn't.
[01:42:36.218 --> 01:42:38.519]  You've got to be careful, though, when you're in those outdoor showers.
[01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:41.321]  You can't even let that stuff get in your mouth.
[01:42:41.341 --> 01:42:49.145]  I mean, I've been in Mexico and stuff on trips in college, and people just let a little bit get in their mouth or take some ice cubes in their drink.
[01:42:49.165 --> 01:42:49.865]  Uh-uh.
[01:42:51.706 --> 01:42:53.887]  I mean, I do not like getting sick, so I don't.
[01:42:54.287 --> 01:42:56.128]  But now when I go out of country...
[01:42:56.949 --> 01:43:00.055]  Which I did last year for a few days down to Mexico.
[01:43:00.355 --> 01:43:03.160]  I take a Berkey sports filter.
[01:43:04.002 --> 01:43:06.566]  They're normally 30-something bucks at a store.
[01:43:06.586 --> 01:43:08.470]  You can get five for $100 or buy them.
[01:43:08.530 --> 01:43:10.213]  I think they're 30 bucks a piece from them.
[01:43:11.787 --> 01:43:12.128]  888-803-4438.
[01:43:13.068 --> 01:43:13.348]  Okay.
[01:43:14.469 --> 01:43:22.513]  Let's go back to Urien in the Netherlands, who said he wrote an article about the loving queen whose wealth is secret in the Netherlands.
[01:43:22.753 --> 01:43:24.054]  Finish up what you were telling us.
[01:43:24.074 --> 01:43:28.056]  Tell us about your article, and then we'll move on.
[01:43:28.096 --> 01:43:28.457]  Go ahead.
[01:43:28.937 --> 01:43:29.117]  Sure.
[01:43:29.977 --> 01:43:37.762]  Well, it's about Bernhard, the mother of the queen, and his Nazi track record, actually, which is quite...
[01:43:38.763 --> 01:43:39.423]  Quite huge.
[01:43:39.603 --> 01:43:40.704]  I mean, he worked at E.G.
[01:43:40.764 --> 01:43:45.646]  Farben, the company that supplied the Zyklon B. He was an SS colonel.
[01:43:45.666 --> 01:43:47.426]  That's the equivalent of a brigadier general.
[01:43:47.946 --> 01:43:48.467]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:43:48.487 --> 01:43:55.729]  He was with the Reiter SS, which is the cavalry version of these fascist people.
[01:43:56.449 --> 01:44:00.591]  He also enjoyed marching with Hitler's street fighters, the SA, in his spare time.
[01:44:01.701 --> 01:44:04.342]  And, well, I mean, it just goes on and on.
[01:44:04.462 --> 01:44:08.603]  And he, like, switched it immediately when the war started in 1939.
[01:44:09.504 --> 01:44:17.346]  As the German dictator increasingly guessed wrong in military affairs, he was evenly mistaken about the prince himself, because Bernard was not an idiot.
[01:44:17.966 --> 01:44:19.467]  I mean, he just switched sides.
[01:44:20.305 --> 01:44:25.068]  When the Second World War broke out, and he just flipped sides in the blink of an eye.
[01:44:25.088 --> 01:44:28.010]  He had changed from an outright Nazi to an Allied Air Force hero.
[01:44:28.250 --> 01:44:35.775]  Now the Prince, the Queen's son, who was going to be the King, he was actually in Germany during World War II and had to be flown out to Franco-Fascist Spain.
[01:44:36.554 --> 01:44:39.376]  I mean, that's how ingratiated the Nazis were.
[01:44:39.916 --> 01:44:43.499]  Then, of course, their top agents, the Bushes, got most of the money, and that's why they're in power today.
[01:44:43.979 --> 01:44:49.303]  The Nazi nest egg put Bush in, and they run the Democrats, too, and we're entering hell on earth.
[01:44:50.384 --> 01:44:51.144]  I talked to Kevin.
[01:44:51.164 --> 01:44:52.025]  He didn't get your email.
[01:44:52.065 --> 01:44:52.745]  Send it again.
[01:44:52.765 --> 01:44:53.546]  All right.
[01:44:54.447 --> 01:44:55.547]  We have spam filters.
[01:44:55.607 --> 01:44:59.410]  It might be your ISPs being blocked by us, but try to send it again.
[01:44:59.430 --> 01:45:00.211]  Will you send it right now?
[01:45:00.731 --> 01:45:02.112]  I'll send it right now.
[01:45:03.101 --> 01:45:03.601]  Thank you, sir.
[01:45:03.621 --> 01:45:04.862]  Good to have you on board with us.
[01:45:05.882 --> 01:45:07.342]  Rick in Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[01:45:07.402 --> 01:45:07.843]  Go ahead.
[01:45:07.863 --> 01:45:09.123]  Thanks.
[01:45:09.563 --> 01:45:10.243]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:45:10.964 --> 01:45:13.925]  Yeah, I listen to you every day, man.
[01:45:14.165 --> 01:45:15.825]  I'm really in love with what you're doing, Alex.
[01:45:16.786 --> 01:45:17.726]  I want to thank you for that.
[01:45:17.866 --> 01:45:22.428]  Well, it's a labor of love for the good folks and a labor of hatred for the New World Order, but thank you.
[01:45:22.848 --> 01:45:25.268]  Okay, let me hit some points real quick because I know time is limited.
[01:45:25.288 --> 01:45:29.650]  I don't know if you've seen this movie that's showing on Google.
[01:45:30.655 --> 01:45:33.096]  And it's called Monopoly Men, the Federal Reserve Fraud.
[01:45:33.436 --> 01:45:33.677]  Yes.
[01:45:34.077 --> 01:45:34.717]  Have you seen that?
[01:45:34.737 --> 01:45:35.317]  Yeah, it's good.
[01:45:35.658 --> 01:45:37.459]  Yes, I watched that this morning.
[01:45:37.519 --> 01:45:38.219]  I was impressed.
[01:45:39.019 --> 01:45:40.420]  And I learned quite a bit from that.
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:45.603]  You can also watch America, Freedom to Fascism on Google, and you can watch Terror Storm there, yeah?
[01:45:45.863 --> 01:45:47.764]  Yes, I've seen everything you've done.
[01:45:47.804 --> 01:45:48.264]  I've seen it.
[01:45:49.225 --> 01:45:50.305]  And now I have a collection.
[01:45:50.745 --> 01:45:51.266]  Well, good.
[01:45:51.746 --> 01:45:53.627]  But hey, I want to hit a point real quick.
[01:45:54.187 --> 01:45:55.048]  I did some checking.
[01:45:55.828 --> 01:45:59.310]  And on JFK, Martin Luther King, and RFK, you know...
[01:46:00.273 --> 01:46:01.213]  John F. Kennedy's brother?
[01:46:01.453 --> 01:46:01.734]  Yeah.
[01:46:02.054 --> 01:46:02.414]  Robert?
[01:46:03.154 --> 01:46:10.277]  I did some checking, and I found out that those guys, when they were assassinated, the connection was with the Federal Reserve.
[01:46:10.717 --> 01:46:11.337]  Did you know that?
[01:46:11.818 --> 01:46:16.859]  Yeah, Kennedy signed an executive order basically abolishing his power to coin the money.
[01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:28.204]  He started issuing the first $5 billion of $44 billion in $5 bills, reissuing Lincoln Greenbacks, and that's one of the reasons that capped him.
[01:46:28.826 --> 01:46:31.981]  Yeah, I didn't know it went all the way back to Abraham Lincoln.
[01:46:32.001 --> 01:46:32.805]  I looked him up, too.
[01:46:34.085 --> 01:46:34.685]  It sure does.
[01:46:34.705 --> 01:46:41.186]  When you go to a gun show or a coin collection shop, tell them I want a Lincoln Greenback 1962 reissued by Kennedy.
[01:46:41.206 --> 01:46:41.186]  1962?
[01:46:42.727 --> 01:46:43.727]  And they usually go for about $15.
[01:46:44.787 --> 01:46:48.508]  It's a red-stamped $5 bill that says United States Note.
[01:46:49.028 --> 01:46:49.388]  Okay.
[01:46:49.648 --> 01:46:52.589]  It's still a fiat currency, but it's issued with no debt.
[01:46:52.609 --> 01:46:54.609]  See, the government can just print money, and that's what they're supposed to.
[01:46:55.029 --> 01:47:02.551]  Instead, the private banks did a deal where they print a dollar, a dollar of debt is created and given to the private banks for the privilege of having money.
[01:47:02.871 --> 01:47:03.331]  Exactly.
[01:47:03.351 --> 01:47:03.951]  It's a little fraud.
[01:47:04.131 --> 01:47:04.611]  Exactly.
[01:47:04.631 --> 01:47:11.236]  Because I found out Monopoly money and the money that the Federal Reserve prints, you might as well have a blank piece of paper because it equals the same thing.
[01:47:11.376 --> 01:47:19.141]  Well, it's even worse, though, because in the past it was a blank piece of paper backed up by the faith, and then previously with gold and silver, the pointage.
[01:47:19.542 --> 01:47:22.924]  Now it's backed up by the national parks, the water, your children.
[01:47:23.464 --> 01:47:28.788]  Our birth certificates, it is confirmed, are trafficked as collateral to the global debt.
[01:47:28.828 --> 01:47:29.749]  I appreciate your call.
[01:47:30.770 --> 01:47:31.810]  It's very serious.
[01:47:31.850 --> 01:47:33.251]  Good to have you call in, Rick.
[01:47:33.271 --> 01:47:33.972]  I appreciate it.
[01:47:34.352 --> 01:47:35.393]  Dave in California.
[01:47:35.413 --> 01:47:36.674]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:47:36.694 --> 01:47:37.254]  Go ahead, Dave.
[01:47:37.535 --> 01:47:38.655]  Good morning, Commander Jones.
[01:47:38.675 --> 01:47:39.456]  How are you doing?
[01:47:39.596 --> 01:47:43.659]  Private Dave Short of the American Tyranny Destruction Nationalist Troop.
[01:47:43.699 --> 01:47:46.461]  That's Alpha Tenga Delta NORAD reporting.
[01:47:47.982 --> 01:47:48.923]  Thanks for calling in.
[01:47:48.963 --> 01:47:49.623]  What's on your mind?
[01:47:49.703 --> 01:47:51.585]  Well, I've got a question and a short statement.
[01:47:52.465 --> 01:47:56.608]  I'm with the people for 9-11 Justice Forum, and we're putting together a new front on 9-11 truth.
[01:47:57.662 --> 01:48:04.288]  We're collecting the absolute best pieces of video evidence we can gather and making a DVD out of it, sort of a compressed one.
[01:48:04.308 --> 01:48:10.493]  Then we're going to send it out to the most powerful state political, law enforcement, religious, and bureaucratic leaders we can find.
[01:48:10.513 --> 01:48:14.016]  We're going to send them out certified mail with return receipt.
[01:48:14.516 --> 01:48:18.419]  This forces their office to sign for them and gives us a record that they received them.
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:25.045]  The package will include a DVD, a brief cover letter, and an overview of bullet points on 9-11 Truth and the police state
[01:48:25.407 --> 01:48:25.507]  Good.
[01:48:25.527 --> 01:48:25.667]  Good.
[01:48:25.687 --> 01:48:25.787]  Good.
[01:48:45.763 --> 01:48:48.724]  And it forces people to take action or to expose themselves.
[01:48:48.924 --> 01:48:49.564]  Well, that's the key.
[01:48:49.584 --> 01:48:51.744]  A lot of police and detectives are actually good people.
[01:48:51.764 --> 01:48:53.505]  They're just totally ignorant, like the general public.
[01:48:54.005 --> 01:48:56.226]  And I remember the time I was in the Travis County SWAT team.
[01:48:56.846 --> 01:48:58.306]  We've done a lot of bad things, by the way.
[01:48:58.786 --> 01:49:00.807]  But Lieutenant Beck was a good guy.
[01:49:01.127 --> 01:49:01.987]  And I walk in there.
[01:49:02.027 --> 01:49:04.308]  They invited me up because it was above the county commissioner building.
[01:49:04.328 --> 01:49:05.148]  It was actually across the street.
[01:49:05.188 --> 01:49:11.569]  But to make a long story short, there's all these Oklahoma City Inside Job videos and all these others on the shelf.
[01:49:11.909 --> 01:49:12.950]  And I saw them way across.
[01:49:12.970 --> 01:49:14.490]  They weren't trying to, like, lead me past them.
[01:49:15.183 --> 01:49:17.505]  And then, yeah, that was pretty interesting.
[01:49:17.925 --> 01:49:18.205]  Yeah.
[01:49:18.686 --> 01:49:20.567]  Well, anyway, so I've got a question for you real quick.
[01:49:20.627 --> 01:49:20.867]  Sure.
[01:49:20.887 --> 01:49:22.148]  And a statement for the New World Order.
[01:49:22.549 --> 01:49:27.232]  So the Supreme Commander... Do you want me to wait?
[01:49:27.473 --> 01:49:28.513]  Please knock it off, sir.
[01:49:28.834 --> 01:49:31.536]  Okay, well, anyway... We've got a big problem if I'm a Supreme Commander.
[01:49:31.596 --> 01:49:32.236]  It's cool, though.
[01:49:32.576 --> 01:49:38.841]  Plus, it's like me dancing around in a general's cap and lapels out on the front line.
[01:49:38.981 --> 01:49:40.462]  It's a joke, but it's just out of respect.
[01:49:40.483 --> 01:49:42.524]  I understand, but they take that stuff serious.
[01:49:42.704 --> 01:49:43.705]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:43.765 --> 01:49:44.906]  No, I'm just a private...
[01:49:45.603 --> 01:49:52.267]  You want to get down to it, I'm a special forces commander deep behind enemy lines, force multiplying for the overthrow of the New World Order.
[01:49:56.730 --> 01:50:02.174]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.554 --> 01:50:10.159]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.874 --> 01:50:17.937]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.337 --> 01:50:29.782]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.062 --> 01:50:33.564]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.044 --> 01:50:35.945]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.305 --> 01:50:40.067]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:55.031 --> 01:50:56.092]  The war on terrorism.
[01:50:56.412 --> 01:50:59.194]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:50:59.454 --> 01:51:03.616]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:51:04.037 --> 01:51:04.877]  So what do you do?
[01:51:05.197 --> 01:51:09.760]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?

[01:53:02.846 --> 01:53:19.638]  Please visit InfoWars.com to get America's freedom to fascism, exposing the Federal Reserve, the IRS, the North American Union.
[01:53:19.698 --> 01:53:20.358]  Great film, 1995.
[01:53:20.779 --> 01:53:24.982]  You can get Terror Storm for $9.95 with it if you wish, or get it by itself.
[01:53:26.232 --> 01:53:29.273]  Terror Storm, normally $19.95, but I want you to get Freedom to Fascism.
[01:53:29.293 --> 01:53:30.354]  She can get that combo deal.
[01:53:31.074 --> 01:53:34.936]  And, yeah, we're trying to drive Terror Storm right now to number one on Amazon.
[01:53:34.976 --> 01:53:35.576]  It's working.
[01:53:35.616 --> 01:53:36.377]  It's in stock.
[01:53:37.777 --> 01:53:38.138]  It's like $12 now.
[01:53:39.665 --> 01:53:41.846]  They upped the price a dollar, but it's still a great deal.
[01:53:42.087 --> 01:53:44.008]  And we're at, like, number 20 right now.
[01:53:44.068 --> 01:53:45.809]  Let's drive it to number one.
[01:53:45.849 --> 01:53:47.470]  It's got to happen now, not tomorrow.
[01:53:47.810 --> 01:53:48.851]  Let's drive it to number one.
[01:53:48.871 --> 01:53:50.972]  Please visit Infowars.com if you're online.
[01:53:51.292 --> 01:53:51.973]  Link through and do that.
[01:53:51.993 --> 01:53:53.934]  All right, I'm going to cover tons of news in the next hour.
[01:53:53.954 --> 01:53:56.195]  Continue with calls at First News when we start the next hour.
[01:53:56.235 --> 01:53:57.796]  A bunch of it, so stay with us.
[01:53:58.116 --> 01:53:59.978]  But right now, let's go back to Dave in California.
[01:54:00.018 --> 01:54:00.678]  Finish up your point.
[01:54:00.958 --> 01:54:01.979]  Thanks for holding me over, Alex.
[01:54:02.458 --> 01:54:10.679]  So as Special Forces Commander of the Front to Liberate Occupied America, I'd like your two favorite pieces of 9-11 DVD evidence to use in our effort.
[01:54:13.220 --> 01:54:18.701]  I would have to say Building 7 information with them blowing it up and then other people admitting they blew it up.
[01:54:18.741 --> 01:54:21.121]  Now there's footage of police saying, get back, they're going to blow it up.
[01:54:23.302 --> 01:54:31.623]  I would also get into the NORAD stand down and Norman Mineta testimony talking about how Dick Cheney said the order still stood.
[01:54:32.757 --> 01:54:34.378]  And then I'm thinking about it.
[01:54:34.458 --> 01:54:35.858]  There's so many areas.
[01:54:35.899 --> 01:54:42.962]  Bin Laden being CIA, the insider trading, the hijackers trained at U.S.
[01:54:43.002 --> 01:54:43.782]  military bases.
[01:54:43.802 --> 01:54:44.682]  Okay.
[01:54:45.823 --> 01:54:47.264]  That's really some of the key stuff.
[01:54:47.684 --> 01:54:48.324]  Thank you very much.
[01:54:48.364 --> 01:54:50.305]  And can I make a brief statement to the New World Order?
[01:54:50.365 --> 01:54:50.585]  Sure.
[01:54:50.605 --> 01:54:50.765]  Okay.
[01:54:51.165 --> 01:54:54.207]  To the New World Order out there, I don't care what you say.
[01:54:54.267 --> 01:54:56.888]  I'm not afraid and I'm way too old to change.
[01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:58.851]  I'm never going to stop.
[01:54:58.952 --> 01:55:02.975]  I'm going to keep yelling until all you freaks are in prison.
[01:55:03.395 --> 01:55:04.937]  I'm going to spend every dime.
[01:55:05.197 --> 01:55:06.578]  I'll starve if I have to.
[01:55:06.738 --> 01:55:07.959]  I do not care.
[01:55:08.380 --> 01:55:10.942]  I'm not going to your stinking FEMA camps.
[01:55:11.122 --> 01:55:12.884]  I'm not going to bow.
[01:55:13.184 --> 01:55:14.565]  I'm going to go down fighting.
[01:55:14.986 --> 01:55:15.366]  In fact...
[01:55:16.127 --> 01:55:21.191]  I'm so glad to be alive and free at this time, this crucial time in our history.
[01:55:21.391 --> 01:55:27.796]  I'm so glad not to be one of your dumbed-down, propagandized, frightened, debt-ridden, brainwashed trolls.
[01:55:28.336 --> 01:55:35.341]  In fact, it's a total privilege to expend my life, my treasure, and my sacred honor to defeat you monsters.
[01:55:37.323 --> 01:55:37.703]  I love it.
[01:55:37.963 --> 01:55:38.364]  I love it.
[01:55:38.384 --> 01:55:38.684]  Thank you.
[01:55:38.704 --> 01:55:39.484]  You said it all there.
[01:55:39.705 --> 01:55:41.806]  Really, that's the maximum of this broadcast.
[01:55:41.866 --> 01:55:44.428]  And listen, I am just the equivalent of...
[01:55:45.166 --> 01:55:45.887]  We're good to go.
[01:56:01.105 --> 01:56:03.647]  Micro-printing presses is the equivalent of the Internet.
[01:56:04.387 --> 01:56:05.228]  The DVDs.
[01:56:05.268 --> 01:56:07.109]  We're educating the indigenous population.
[01:56:07.529 --> 01:56:08.269]  We're winning.
[01:56:08.449 --> 01:56:11.531]  We're winning on every front, every major poll.
[01:56:12.132 --> 01:56:15.653]  Again, I heard top strategists on Beyond the Beltway, a big TV show out of Chicago.
[01:56:16.314 --> 01:56:17.274]  It's also on radio.
[01:56:17.735 --> 01:56:20.036]  Admitting that the New World Order is the new issue.
[01:56:20.116 --> 01:56:21.096]  It's never going away.
[01:56:21.417 --> 01:56:23.578]  The general public doesn't trust anybody in the government.
[01:56:23.898 --> 01:56:25.479]  The North American Union is the issue.
[01:56:26.869 --> 01:56:28.750]  So go ahead and get rid of the borders, you bastards.
[01:56:28.810 --> 01:56:29.231]  Excuse me.
[01:56:29.251 --> 01:56:29.971]  I don't need to be like that.
[01:56:29.991 --> 01:56:31.232]  Go ahead and get rid of the borders.
[01:56:31.272 --> 01:56:33.413]  Go ahead and try to ban our free speech.
[01:56:33.673 --> 01:56:34.313]  It isn't going to work.
[01:56:35.073 --> 01:56:37.114]  Just show everybody who you are.
[01:56:37.595 --> 01:56:39.496]  You have failed.
[01:56:40.096 --> 01:56:42.297]  And I do pledge myself eternally to resist you.
[01:56:42.717 --> 01:56:44.058]  And I ask God for all the guidance.
[01:56:44.358 --> 01:56:47.420]  I don't ask God for anything other than to lead God and direct me.
[01:56:47.860 --> 01:56:50.221]  And that God's will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[01:56:52.376 --> 01:56:54.037]  And I am honored to be alive right now.
[01:56:54.197 --> 01:56:56.977]  I am so blessed, and it's scary sometimes.
[01:56:56.997 --> 01:57:00.918]  In the middle of the night, you wake up, you think about, my gosh, I'm really in the thick of it.
[01:57:02.059 --> 01:57:02.699]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:57:02.719 --> 01:57:04.219]  I wouldn't have it any other way.
[01:57:04.239 --> 01:57:05.200]  I wouldn't change anything.
[01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:07.680]  I am honored to be here.
[01:57:07.700 --> 01:57:09.921]  And I'm honored that you're tuning in to listen to me.
[01:57:09.941 --> 01:57:13.302]  And I just beg you to take action in this fight like you never have before.
[01:57:14.585 --> 01:57:16.507]  Alright, I covered a lot of news in the first hour.
[01:57:16.527 --> 01:57:20.690]  I want to go back over it, but get into more detail, and cover a bunch of news I haven't covered.
[01:57:20.750 --> 01:57:21.691]  It's going to be exhausting.
[01:57:21.711 --> 01:57:31.478]  I kind of look at these stacks each day, and I'm daunted, but when we get back, I'll recap some of the news, then I'll get into what's happening in Iraq, then I'll get into the free speech annihilation here domestically, and a lot more.
[01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:38.264]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com, or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.796 --> 01:57:50.436]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.097 --> 01:57:52.157]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.857 --> 01:57:53.978]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.618 --> 01:57:55.499]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.199 --> 01:57:57.160]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.780 --> 01:58:01.482]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.942 --> 01:58:06.064]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.445 --> 01:58:14.248]  We are now into hour number three in this global transmission against tyranny and dehumanization.
[01:58:15.271 --> 01:58:30.274]  I'm Alex Jones, your wartime broadcaster in a battle for the republic against the enemy combatant puppets Bush, Pelosi, and their Rockefeller Rothschild, World Bank, IMF, Saxe-Coburg, Goethe, Queen Beatrix, Allied Crime Syndicate owners.
[01:58:32.114 --> 01:58:34.135]  We will defeat the Allied Crime Syndicate.
[01:58:34.175 --> 01:58:34.735]  We will.
[01:58:34.815 --> 01:58:35.715]  We don't have a choice.
[01:58:36.135 --> 01:58:44.217]  They are coming to build a worldwide control grid to then orderly have one-child policies, forced drugging, forced vaccination, and mass eugenics culling.
[01:58:45.842 --> 01:58:48.903]  This is a worldwide alert, a worldwide mayday.
[01:58:48.963 --> 01:58:54.205]  Humanity is under massive scientifically crafted focused bombardment.
[01:58:54.925 --> 01:59:05.269]  Using the basic psychology, sociology, and group dynamics, they are waging war against every existing system that is the bedrock of human activity on the globe.
[01:59:06.310 --> 01:59:12.212]  They are attempting to perfect a worldwide controlled slave prison grid, a prison planet.
[01:59:13.098 --> 01:59:14.239]  Worldwide mayday.
[01:59:14.779 --> 01:59:16.841]  Mayday, mayday, mayday.
[01:59:17.241 --> 01:59:18.582]  And I mean it when I say that.
[01:59:19.143 --> 01:59:20.444]  Mayday, mayday, mayday.
[01:59:20.984 --> 01:59:22.525]  Humanity is being dehumanized.
[01:59:22.565 --> 01:59:23.466]  We're under attack.
[01:59:23.887 --> 01:59:25.568]  Mayday, mayday, mayday.
[01:59:27.770 --> 01:59:29.191]  Break your conditioning out there.
[01:59:29.211 --> 01:59:31.733]  In your gut, you know I'm telling you the truth.
[01:59:32.233 --> 01:59:38.058]  In your heart and soul, in your bones, in your marrow, in the heart of your marrow, you know the truth.
[01:59:39.838 --> 01:59:40.758]  Get out of the fear.
[01:59:40.898 --> 01:59:44.039]  Join us in the final battle for the Republic.
[01:59:44.760 --> 01:59:46.620]  Join us in the battle for humanity.
[01:59:48.181 --> 01:59:49.962]  Realize how serious things are.
[01:59:50.022 --> 01:59:54.803]  Realize the incredible, bizarre tyranny taking place all around us.
[01:59:57.324 --> 02:00:02.786]  I have a huge stack of news I mentioned earlier concerning out-of-control police state off of what people say.
[02:00:03.630 --> 02:00:05.531]  Mid-flight sexual play lands U.S.
[02:00:05.551 --> 02:00:07.192]  couple afoul of anti-terror law.
[02:00:07.733 --> 02:00:09.814]  They were kissing and cuddling and were told to stop.
[02:00:10.715 --> 02:00:15.098]  And they're being charged with 20 years in prison under the Patriot Act and million-dollar fines.
[02:00:15.938 --> 02:00:17.079]  That's AP.
[02:00:18.540 --> 02:00:22.183]  In Singapore, a 67-year-old Australian man was joking.
[02:00:22.203 --> 02:00:23.463]  Well, an Australian doesn't joke around.
[02:00:23.483 --> 02:00:24.224]  They're pretty nice folks.
[02:00:24.784 --> 02:00:26.265]  And said, there's no room in here for my bag.
[02:00:26.305 --> 02:00:27.586]  Where do you guys put the bombs?
[02:00:28.147 --> 02:00:30.368]  He's being charged under international U.N.
[02:00:30.428 --> 02:00:30.768]  law.
[02:00:30.828 --> 02:00:31.609]  Well, to tell that,
[02:00:33.860 --> 02:00:34.520]  Terror law.
[02:00:35.100 --> 02:00:37.601]  Press freedom being eaten away, says the London Guardian.
[02:00:39.441 --> 02:00:42.302]  PC Mad Britain savages Newell's thought crime.
[02:00:42.362 --> 02:00:48.404]  Soccer manager Newell slammed, castigated for saying he's sick of the new women refs that haven't been properly trained.
[02:00:48.424 --> 02:00:51.465]  They're talking about his arrest and his firing now.
[02:00:52.025 --> 02:00:52.865]  Yeah, that's the freedom!
[02:00:53.485 --> 02:00:55.066]  Don't criticize a woman, you go to jail.
[02:00:55.566 --> 02:01:00.127]  And again, even if you're against men saying women can't do this or can't do that, men can't have babies.
[02:01:01.349 --> 02:01:03.530]  Men don't look super beautiful like you do.
[02:01:04.331 --> 02:01:05.872]  Men aren't as smart as you in a lot of ways.
[02:01:06.812 --> 02:01:07.773]  They're not as good as a lot of them.
[02:01:07.793 --> 02:01:08.934]  But I'm just telling you, we're different.
[02:01:09.294 --> 02:01:11.495]  You can't carry an 80-pound pack 50 miles.
[02:01:12.296 --> 02:01:16.078]  And you sure can't take on 10 guys in a trench with a dagger.
[02:01:17.379 --> 02:01:20.420]  And women can't take as many knife wounds as a man can and keep fighting.
[02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:22.822]  And your nervous system and your organs aren't built the same.
[02:01:23.722 --> 02:01:26.484]  But again, turning us all against each other is what it's about.
[02:01:27.605 --> 02:01:29.546]  Now Daddy Bush is saying that...
[02:01:30.672 --> 02:01:33.294]  You get infections, by the way, living in a foxhole for a month.
[02:01:33.554 --> 02:01:34.134]  I could continue.
[02:01:34.715 --> 02:01:42.379]  Now Daddy Bush slams bloggers, blames Internet for ugly climate, echoes vitriolic rhetoric of web haters.
[02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:45.861]  Need to ban that web immediately.
[02:01:45.881 --> 02:01:47.983]  Hate crime bill will become law.
[02:01:48.063 --> 02:01:50.124]  Total emergency alert by Pastor Ted Pike.
[02:01:50.444 --> 02:01:52.345]  Democrats' control means hate bill will pass.
[02:01:52.365 --> 02:01:54.747]  We'll get into all of this and more.
[02:01:54.927 --> 02:01:56.808]  GPS surveillance creeps into daily life.
[02:01:59.446 --> 02:02:01.328]  Reuters official says U.S.
[02:02:01.368 --> 02:02:03.289]  may mole preemptive strike on Iran.
[02:02:03.309 --> 02:02:05.531]  Another article out of the Malaysian Sun.
[02:02:05.571 --> 02:02:08.454]  Israeli defense official says Israel may attack Iran within a month.
[02:02:10.175 --> 02:02:13.418]  Ahmadinejad's nuclear success celebration set for next month.
[02:02:16.240 --> 02:02:17.141]  We'll cover it all.
[02:02:19.142 --> 02:02:22.305]  Cardinal says they've got to get rid of our government and our border and get rid of it now.
[02:02:23.746 --> 02:02:27.269]  They're going to butcher the border fence that never was going to be built.
[02:02:28.729 --> 02:02:29.971]  Don't tell me hiccups are coming up.
[02:02:29.991 --> 02:02:32.814]  That's when I eat my lunch too fast and one minute breaks.
[02:02:34.056 --> 02:02:38.081]  And when we get back, I'm getting into Iraq and one of the greatest crimes in modern history.
[02:02:39.082 --> 02:02:39.743]  Stay with us.
[02:02:40.364 --> 02:02:41.586]  Fire up your soul.
[02:02:42.286 --> 02:02:42.827]  Wake up.
[02:02:43.087 --> 02:02:44.149]  Tune into reality.
[02:02:48.593 --> 02:02:51.735]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:52.115 --> 02:02:54.016]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:54.416 --> 02:03:02.080]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.740 --> 02:03:09.804]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.204 --> 02:03:13.146]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:03:13.526 --> 02:03:15.847]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[02:03:16.268 --> 02:03:17.088]  NSA spies.
[02:03:17.660 --> 02:03:19.881]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:19.901 --> 02:03:23.742]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:46.144 --> 02:03:47.124]  Good morning, honey.
[02:03:47.485 --> 02:03:53.487]  Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation.
[02:03:53.767 --> 02:03:54.367]  Yeah.
[02:03:54.747 --> 02:03:56.168]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[02:03:56.528 --> 02:03:59.929]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel burkey system.
[02:04:00.409 --> 02:04:01.890]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[02:04:02.350 --> 02:04:04.051]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[02:04:04.431 --> 02:04:06.212]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[02:04:06.412 --> 02:04:07.252]  Honey, cheer up.
[02:04:07.685 --> 02:04:09.947]  I brought our Sport Berkey purifiers.
[02:04:10.207 --> 02:04:10.507]  What?
[02:04:10.948 --> 02:04:21.437]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey purifiers.
[02:04:21.717 --> 02:04:26.561]  You know, this is a terrific cabin, and wow, have you noticed the beautiful weather?
[02:04:26.881 --> 02:04:28.062]  Don't ruin your vacation.
[02:04:28.162 --> 02:04:29.983]  Get a Travel Berkey today for only $209.
[02:04:30.043 --> 02:04:30.723]  Or get a Sport Berkey for only $39.

[02:04:31.023 --> 02:04:31.203]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:31.243 --> 02:04:32.264]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:04:32.284 --> 02:04:33.585]  Travel Berkey, now available in Iowa.
[02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:48.742]  We understand that decisions related to health can be overwhelming.
[02:04:49.002 --> 02:04:55.786]  That is why at ResearchedHerbs.com we take pride in offering you herbs whose safety and effectiveness have been proven time and time again.
[02:04:56.246 --> 02:05:09.594]  For example, did you know that Live 52, the top-selling natural herbal supplement for liver diseases since 1930, is backed by over 300 research studies and clinical trials and prescribed by more than 200,000 health professionals worldwide?
[02:05:09.915 --> 02:05:13.317]  In fact, the effectiveness of all the herbs featured on ResearchedHerbs.com
[02:05:14.008 --> 02:05:15.189]  That's 1-800-845-3841 for more information.
[02:05:15.209 --> 02:05:15.649]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[02:05:45.180 --> 02:05:52.905]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:53.285 --> 02:05:58.909]  All right, I'm going to get into all the news and continue to take your phone calls.
[02:05:58.969 --> 02:06:10.736]  I've been trying to get Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on, former head of the policy department of the Treasury, for about a week, but he was moving from, I think it was Georgia to Florida.
[02:06:11.474 --> 02:06:14.656]  And he's at his new house, and he said he could come on today, but not the rest of the week.
[02:06:14.676 --> 02:06:17.057]  So at the bottom of the hour, he will be joining us.
[02:06:17.077 --> 02:06:25.182]  I wanted to have him Thursday or Friday, but we can't, so we'll have him on to respond to the election and everything that happened here in about 23 minutes from now.
[02:06:25.202 --> 02:06:29.664]  Okay, 24 minutes and 14 seconds to be exact.
[02:06:31.305 --> 02:06:32.926]  If we're able to get him, we're calling him back right now.
[02:06:33.991 --> 02:06:34.991]  I know we've got a lot of calls here.
[02:06:35.031 --> 02:06:35.691]  We'll get to you, too.
[02:06:35.851 --> 02:06:37.272]  Let me just briefly get into Iraq.
[02:06:37.732 --> 02:06:39.812]  I was thinking about it this morning, and it really hit me.
[02:06:39.872 --> 02:06:44.634]  I called Paul Watson and gave him the download and told him, I think you ought to do a report on it.
[02:06:45.674 --> 02:06:47.174]  He or Steve or somebody around here.
[02:06:48.455 --> 02:06:55.136]  And that is, you know, the headline should be, 2.15 million Iraqis dead, 22 million to go.
[02:06:55.176 --> 02:06:55.396]  Since 1990.
[02:07:02.967 --> 02:07:06.249]  Okay, that is 16 years ago.
[02:07:06.329 --> 02:07:07.530]  It's right at 16 years.
[02:07:08.211 --> 02:07:09.331]  They have been under sanctions.
[02:07:09.351 --> 02:07:10.332]  They have been dehumanized.
[02:07:10.352 --> 02:07:13.194]  They've gone from First World to well below Third World.
[02:07:14.135 --> 02:07:25.983]  Lancet, the British Medical Journal, who was allowed access to Iraq as a part of the Coalition of the Willing, did a two-and-a-half-year study and concluded that since the war began, the new one, the three-and-a-half-year-old war, 654,000 people,
[02:07:31.897 --> 02:07:33.077]  Well, then it was 200 and something.
[02:07:33.097 --> 02:07:33.878]  I forget the exact number.
[02:07:34.478 --> 02:07:37.479]  Iraqis have died from war-related incidents.
[02:07:39.199 --> 02:07:39.540]  Okay?
[02:07:40.100 --> 02:07:41.200]  Over 12,000 U.S.
[02:07:41.220 --> 02:07:46.022]  troops have died from complications, but they say only 3,000 died on the ground before they were flown out.
[02:07:46.062 --> 02:07:48.302]  If you die in Ramstein, Germany, it doesn't count.
[02:07:49.023 --> 02:07:49.363]  Okay?
[02:07:51.944 --> 02:07:53.464]  Over 1,000 in Afghanistan.
[02:07:53.484 --> 02:07:55.065]  I mean, these are bad numbers, okay?
[02:07:55.085 --> 02:07:56.105]  But think about the Iraqis.
[02:07:57.681 --> 02:08:02.707]  Over a million and a half, but we're being conservative with the admitted number of a million and a half from the late 1990 through 2003, March 23rd of 2003.
[02:08:03.708 --> 02:08:04.710]  Over a million, 500,000.
[02:08:04.750 --> 02:08:07.273]  Visualize how many sports stadiums that is with 100,000 people in each one.
[02:08:07.293 --> 02:08:08.494]  I don't have a calculator in front of me.
[02:08:18.453 --> 02:08:19.333]  Maybe you can do it, Scott.
[02:08:19.353 --> 02:08:20.574]  Or maybe I can just do the math right here.
[02:08:20.614 --> 02:08:21.634]  I can't really do it while I'm talking.
[02:08:22.234 --> 02:08:23.054]  I meant to do that earlier.
[02:08:23.114 --> 02:08:30.276]  How many hundred thousands goes into 2.15 million?
[02:08:30.296 --> 02:08:30.276]  2,150,000.
[02:08:31.316 --> 02:08:35.657]  That is conservative guaranteed.
[02:08:35.677 --> 02:08:38.718]  The number's probably a few hundred thousand higher.
[02:08:39.618 --> 02:08:41.719]  But conservatively, 2.15 million.
[02:08:47.151 --> 02:08:49.632]  How many sports stadiums is that?
[02:08:50.752 --> 02:08:53.852]  And this isn't Adolf Hitler 60 years ago.
[02:08:53.872 --> 02:08:55.873]  This isn't Joseph Stalin 55 years ago.
[02:08:56.233 --> 02:08:59.034]  This isn't Mao 45, 30 years ago.
[02:08:59.054 --> 02:09:00.974]  He did it during that period, 45 to 30 years ago.
[02:09:02.414 --> 02:09:03.134]  The biggest killing.
[02:09:03.154 --> 02:09:03.735]  It still goes on.
[02:09:03.795 --> 02:09:04.375]  It's ongoing.
[02:09:04.855 --> 02:09:06.215]  It was 55 million a decade ago.
[02:09:06.255 --> 02:09:07.695]  Now it's up to 60 million.
[02:09:08.375 --> 02:09:09.936]  I mean, let's talk about that.
[02:09:11.536 --> 02:09:11.916]  Okay?
[02:09:11.956 --> 02:09:15.537]  I mean, this is massive concerted programs.
[02:09:16.129 --> 02:09:19.950]  And the Pentagon wrote about breaking it up, balkanizing it, and driving it down to third world status.
[02:09:20.250 --> 02:09:20.770]  They're doing it.
[02:09:21.130 --> 02:09:33.013]  I mean, do you really believe that hundreds of troops in official uniforms, driving armored vehicles, just pull up out of nowhere in downtown Baghdad, right by the green zone, and grab 150 plus people?
[02:09:33.493 --> 02:09:36.734]  Now the number's growing out of a university just magically.
[02:09:37.893 --> 02:09:39.254]  And no one stops them, no one.
[02:09:39.334 --> 02:09:40.554]  It's just like U.S.
[02:09:41.255 --> 02:09:54.441]  Anglo troops go in with over 50 Iraqi National Guard, go into that mosque for an entire evening planting bombs and then blow the roof off, and none of our troops stopped it because it's an inside job.
[02:09:55.161 --> 02:09:57.743]  Clearly, we've had the former top CIA analyst here on to tell you that.
[02:09:58.563 --> 02:10:00.244]  Ray McGovern said, oh, clearly, that's an inside job.
[02:10:01.727 --> 02:10:03.208]  I mean, this is bad.
[02:10:03.448 --> 02:10:04.829]  I mean, this is pole pot.
[02:10:04.909 --> 02:10:06.470]  Our government's just Khmer Rouge-ing.
[02:10:06.850 --> 02:10:14.274]  So when you hear that the new Iraqi military is insurgent, well, because our government is the insurgent.
[02:10:14.314 --> 02:10:16.135]  See, that's how the New World Order wins, folks.
[02:10:16.175 --> 02:10:17.116]  They play both sides.
[02:10:17.796 --> 02:10:20.077]  So the university's trying to stay open.
[02:10:20.157 --> 02:10:23.399]  Every university is closed indefinitely in Iraq now.
[02:10:24.940 --> 02:10:25.800]  And it's going to continue.
[02:10:26.641 --> 02:10:27.461]  So think about that.
[02:10:27.481 --> 02:10:27.802]  2.1.5 million.
[02:10:31.543 --> 02:10:33.345]  2,150,000.
[02:10:31.623 --> 02:10:33.345]  I'm going to keep saying that number.
[02:10:33.925 --> 02:10:34.566]  And counting!
[02:10:36.307 --> 02:10:37.628]  I mean, you've got a country.
[02:10:39.790 --> 02:10:45.214]  A country, depending on the estimate, in 1990, between 24.5 and 25 mil.
[02:10:45.334 --> 02:10:48.417]  And it's admittedly now 22 million and going down.
[02:10:49.578 --> 02:10:52.260]  I mean, the global's doing a pretty darn good job.
[02:10:53.101 --> 02:10:59.766]  That place used to have rock and roll western music stations and women running around without wearing their headdresses and
[02:11:00.447 --> 02:11:01.808]  Most of the graduates were women.
[02:11:01.828 --> 02:11:03.209]  You know, we've talked about all this.
[02:11:04.210 --> 02:11:05.691]  Swimming pools and everything.
[02:11:05.911 --> 02:11:06.651]  Movie stars.
[02:11:06.991 --> 02:11:08.312]  I mean, the whole deal, folks.
[02:11:08.352 --> 02:11:09.693]  Christians, Jews, living in peace.
[02:11:10.574 --> 02:11:13.236]  Because, again, Saddam had been put in by the U.S.
[02:11:13.296 --> 02:11:14.456]  back when there was a different policy.
[02:11:16.638 --> 02:11:19.320]  But he was pumping too much oil and giving it to his people.
[02:11:19.360 --> 02:11:20.581]  And that is just not allowed.
[02:11:20.681 --> 02:11:21.821]  Serbia, it's not allowed either.
[02:11:23.583 --> 02:11:25.584]  And so now they have a quadrupling in birth defects.
[02:11:25.644 --> 02:11:26.324]  It was a tripling.
[02:11:26.344 --> 02:11:26.985]  Now a quadrupling.
[02:11:27.005 --> 02:11:28.406]  That's official medical journals as well.
[02:11:29.287 --> 02:11:30.588]  Our troops come back and have the same thing.
[02:11:31.389 --> 02:11:32.090]  That's what DU does.
[02:11:32.150 --> 02:11:38.476]  It settles in tissues that, you know, a regular tissue will just get cancer later.
[02:11:38.996 --> 02:11:52.349]  You know, some muscle tissue in your bicep, but things that are very hormonal and have a big exchange, that's why normally the glandular organs get cancer, not to mention the troops getting testicular and ovarian and liver cancer from it and lung cancer.
[02:11:53.870 --> 02:11:54.911]  So it's a hell on earth.
[02:11:56.252 --> 02:12:02.133]  And it's all by design, and the mass extermination is going on in plain view in front of everyone.
[02:12:03.493 --> 02:12:06.414]  And there's your agenda.
[02:12:06.434 --> 02:12:07.034]  2.15 million.
[02:12:07.494 --> 02:12:08.554]  And that isn't discussed enough.
[02:12:08.574 --> 02:12:14.095]  You know, the Lansing Journal comes out with their doctors in the field and say, well, our conservative estimate is 654,000.
[02:12:14.575 --> 02:12:23.317]  And they stress and publish their data, and all these other scientists and statisticians look and say, oh yeah, it's accurate.
[02:12:23.577 --> 02:12:24.697]  It's probably much worse.
[02:12:26.559 --> 02:12:28.600]  Probably hundreds of thousands higher.
[02:12:30.701 --> 02:12:33.803]  Now, I want that to burn in and sink in real good.
[02:12:33.823 --> 02:12:40.566]  Because a lot of soft, good old boys out there listening who make the parking lot comment every day about, just nuke them.
[02:12:40.826 --> 02:12:41.907]  You don't know these people.
[02:12:41.947 --> 02:12:42.747]  You don't know their history.
[02:12:42.787 --> 02:12:43.888]  You can't find them on a map.
[02:12:44.228 --> 02:12:44.948]  You're shameful.
[02:12:45.889 --> 02:12:51.832]  And do you think a government that will do that to those men, women, and children and those wonderful... Iraqis are wonderful people.
[02:12:51.912 --> 02:12:52.532]  I know some of them.
[02:12:53.593 --> 02:12:55.694]  Wonderful, smart people.
[02:12:57.139 --> 02:12:57.759]  Funny people.
[02:12:59.261 --> 02:13:05.585]  And I look at the photos and the video of those women and children, and it makes my guts boil.
[02:13:06.826 --> 02:13:08.667]  And again, empathy isn't something a wimp does.
[02:13:08.687 --> 02:13:11.249]  Oh, I'm this bleeding heart that literally just got tears in my eyes.
[02:13:11.649 --> 02:13:15.291]  It's because empathy is recognizing something happening to someone.
[02:13:15.351 --> 02:13:20.435]  You want to help them because subconsciously in your ingrained programming, you don't want it to happen to you and your people.
[02:13:21.690 --> 02:13:22.791]  And none of us are safe.
[02:13:22.851 --> 02:13:32.976]  I mean, if these globalists will kill 2.15 million right in front of everybody, right in front of everybody, what will they do to us?
[02:13:34.897 --> 02:13:37.378]  And let me tell you, the New World Order has always hated America.
[02:13:37.418 --> 02:13:39.779]  They're getting rid of our borders, butchering, attacking the family.
[02:13:40.099 --> 02:13:42.260]  They've always wanted to Pol Pot America.
[02:13:43.301 --> 02:13:45.222]  They've always wanted to Kermit Rouge America.
[02:13:46.042 --> 02:13:49.024]  They've always wanted to Stalin and Hitler and Mao America.
[02:13:49.645 --> 02:13:50.385]  We're good to go.
[02:13:50.525 --> 02:13:51.326]  We're good to go.
[02:14:13.504 --> 02:14:17.087]  You're going to see your children broken up from you and put on trucks and taken away from you.
[02:14:17.367 --> 02:14:18.448]  They're planning it.
[02:14:18.728 --> 02:14:19.889]  NORTHCOM says it.
[02:14:21.290 --> 02:14:25.274]  I remember seven years ago, Marine Corps colonels saying on video, this is for America.
[02:14:26.094 --> 02:14:27.856]  I videotaped them breaking up the families.
[02:14:30.178 --> 02:14:40.046]  And I'd much rather wake those Marines up, but I tell you right now, folks, that are you going to lay down and get on the trains, which they've got with the shackles and the boxcars?
[02:14:40.086 --> 02:14:40.846]  That's admitted now.
[02:14:41.167 --> 02:14:42.568]  That urban legend turned out to be true.
[02:14:43.405 --> 02:14:46.350]  Are you going to go with them in their vans and their flatback trucks?
[02:14:48.172 --> 02:14:49.174]  I'm asking you right now.
[02:14:50.836 --> 02:14:51.798]  I'm asking you right now.
[02:14:51.898 --> 02:14:54.482]  Are you going to let them do that to this country?
[02:14:55.163 --> 02:14:57.527]  Are you going to let them do to us what they've done to the Iraqis?
[02:14:59.531 --> 02:15:00.772]  Now, they're sophisticated.
[02:15:00.812 --> 02:15:02.393]  We tried to say no to the Iraq War.
[02:15:02.473 --> 02:15:03.594]  We told the world we're against it.
[02:15:03.674 --> 02:15:05.295]  That's the only good thing that came out of this.
[02:15:05.455 --> 02:15:06.376]  All the bad now comes.
[02:15:06.416 --> 02:15:13.401]  The free speech restrictions, the hate crimes legislation, the open borders, the North American Union, what Bush couldn't get out of his Republican Congress.
[02:15:17.684 --> 02:15:18.445]  It's just so sad.
[02:15:19.946 --> 02:15:24.349]  It's so sad to see this happen.
[02:15:26.030 --> 02:15:26.230]  And I...
[02:15:28.772 --> 02:15:29.613]  I'm not going to be part of it.
[02:15:30.874 --> 02:15:31.714]  I'm not going to go along with it.
[02:15:31.734 --> 02:15:32.615]  That's why I'm here.
[02:15:33.175 --> 02:15:35.317]  That's why I was here at 1 o'clock in the morning last night.
[02:15:37.018 --> 02:15:39.440]  And that's why I'll be here at 1 o'clock in the morning tonight.
[02:15:42.522 --> 02:15:55.671]  Because everything in my body, every cell in my body, believe me, I'd rather be making love and eating good food and hunting and fishing
[02:15:57.506 --> 02:15:59.067]  But I don't even really do that, folks.
[02:16:01.369 --> 02:16:06.274]  I literally am totally committed to this fight.
[02:16:06.294 --> 02:16:11.398]  And when I do take off a few days, I feel wracked with guilt because I realize, man, it's on.
[02:16:12.619 --> 02:16:13.780]  I'd like to live a normal life.
[02:16:15.842 --> 02:16:20.847]  I'd like to not have fear of a SWAT team kicking down my door and dragging me out of my house in some trumped up charge.
[02:16:22.188 --> 02:16:23.969]  I'd like to not have those concerns, but...
[02:16:24.952 --> 02:16:34.016]  I'd like to not have to worry about my family, but I have to go through that fear and use that fear and transmute that fear into courage and honor and stand tall.
[02:16:35.656 --> 02:16:47.561]  And stand up for those Iraqi children, because if we don't stand up for those little babes, it's better for us to tie a millstone around our neck, to tie a boulder around our throats and tie it around our neck and throw it in the deepest sea.
[02:16:49.342 --> 02:16:52.123]  I will not be part of the dying corps kidnapping rings.
[02:16:53.010 --> 02:16:55.330]  And you are part of it when you don't speak out against it.
[02:16:55.871 --> 02:16:59.431]  I will not be part of CPS Coast to Coast taking children for medical experiments.
[02:17:00.492 --> 02:17:02.072]  I will not be part of any of it.
[02:17:03.112 --> 02:17:05.132]  And there's not even a choice.
[02:17:06.173 --> 02:17:07.873]  There's not even a discussion of this.
[02:17:08.833 --> 02:17:11.334]  There shouldn't even be a debate going on in your minds.
[02:17:11.374 --> 02:17:17.175]  You should commit wholesale right now.
[02:17:18.869 --> 02:17:23.450]  You should be running to the guns in the Infowar before it goes hot.
[02:17:24.730 --> 02:17:32.532]  You should turn up the heat on this cold war of information and wield the sword of truth and cleave the enemy's heads from their bodies.
[02:17:33.413 --> 02:17:34.113]  Move forward.
[02:17:34.133 --> 02:17:34.853]  Never stop.
[02:17:34.893 --> 02:17:35.593]  Know we're winning.
[02:17:35.893 --> 02:17:38.174]  Don't listen to enemy transmission saying we're losing.
[02:17:39.014 --> 02:17:40.274]  That's their desperation.
[02:17:40.854 --> 02:17:41.795]  Move forward.
[02:17:41.995 --> 02:17:43.435]  Rise, sleeping giant!
[02:17:45.680 --> 02:17:49.309]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[02:17:49.609 --> 02:17:53.117]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[02:17:57.739 --> 02:17:58.899]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:18:23.885 --> 02:18:30.150]  And remember, if you read the Midas Report, you'll receive a free Walking Liberty Silver Half Dollar.
[02:18:30.430 --> 02:18:32.232]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine.
[02:18:49.680 --> 02:18:55.305]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[02:18:55.345 --> 02:18:56.105]  Supreme Court.
[02:18:56.886 --> 02:19:01.189]  Yet on February 29, 1892, in an eye-nothing decision of the U.S.
[02:19:01.209 --> 02:19:04.812]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[02:19:05.813 --> 02:19:11.037]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.
[02:19:11.866 --> 02:19:12.106]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:19:35.760 --> 02:19:36.583]  We're good to go.
[02:19:36.643 --> 02:19:37.124]  We're good to go.
[02:19:45.686 --> 02:19:50.967]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[02:19:51.187 --> 02:19:53.268]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[02:19:53.508 --> 02:20:00.609]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[02:20:00.749 --> 02:20:12.272]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[02:20:12.652 --> 02:20:20.035]  It's multi-voltage capabilities, multiple adapters, and rechargeable batteries provide for flexible source of auxiliary backup power.
[02:20:20.315 --> 02:20:25.298]  Simply place the Berkey solar charger in the sun, plug in your application, and you have power.
[02:20:25.438 --> 02:20:30.440]  Disconnect your application, the system automatically begins charging its own rechargeable batteries.
[02:20:30.840 --> 02:20:34.803]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:20:34.823 --> 02:20:36.124]  Globalists are
[02:20:58.630 --> 02:21:01.911]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.
[02:21:02.311 --> 02:21:04.292]  Start reading the Nationalist Times each month.
[02:21:04.552 --> 02:21:09.953]  The Nationalist Times promotes a common sense, intelligent, and passionate alternative to the reigning party line.
[02:21:10.233 --> 02:21:18.956]  Published monthly since 1985, the Nationalist Times is a 20-page newspaper featuring outstanding writers and columnists who don't believe in taboos or sacred cows.

[02:21:24.497 --> 02:21:24.957]  We're good to go.
[02:22:06.022 --> 02:22:06.622]  Welcome back.
[02:22:09.242 --> 02:22:12.523]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:22:12.563 --> 02:22:14.883]  Let's blitz through your calls as quickly as possible.
[02:22:15.163 --> 02:22:19.084]  They're saying they're going to euthanize any disabled babies and now even premature babies.
[02:22:19.124 --> 02:22:19.704]  Just kill them.
[02:22:20.544 --> 02:22:21.384]  Not let them die.
[02:22:21.504 --> 02:22:22.565]  Kill them in England.
[02:22:23.485 --> 02:22:28.986]  Again, you don't care about a million, two million, 2.1 million, 2.15 million dead Iraqis.
[02:22:29.026 --> 02:22:29.746]  Oh, they'll just kill you.
[02:22:30.959 --> 02:22:34.761]  You see, if you think their life's worthless, your life's worthless too, Bubba.
[02:22:35.421 --> 02:22:36.882]  You didn't know that's how the world works?
[02:22:37.122 --> 02:22:39.203]  What comes around goes around, you reap what you sow?
[02:22:40.323 --> 02:22:47.627]  Let's talk to James in Michigan, and then we'll talk to Keith and Chris and Barbara and others.
[02:22:47.647 --> 02:22:48.267]  Go ahead, James.
[02:22:49.207 --> 02:22:49.808]  Hey, Alex.
[02:22:50.388 --> 02:22:54.330]  I just wanted to say thank you so much for doing what you do.
[02:22:55.090 --> 02:22:57.051]  I woke up to...
[02:22:57.890 --> 02:23:02.151]  Everything that was happening about three years ago when I first watched a Road to Tyranny film.
[02:23:03.112 --> 02:23:11.754]  Ever since then, I've been researching and putting up the good fight against the New World Order, telling all my friends and my family.
[02:23:12.155 --> 02:23:14.956]  Yeah, five years ago when I made Road to Tyranny, we were on the road.
[02:23:14.996 --> 02:23:15.736]  Now we arrived.
[02:23:16.476 --> 02:23:17.496]  Yes, yes.
[02:23:18.437 --> 02:23:20.777]  And I just want to thank you so much for what you do.
[02:23:20.797 --> 02:23:25.599]  You're a real patriot, Alex, and I just can't thank you enough and
[02:23:26.949 --> 02:23:27.929]  God's really leading you.
[02:23:27.989 --> 02:23:28.890]  He opened my eyes.
[02:23:29.370 --> 02:23:33.631]  I thank Him for you and what you do and the Truth Movement.
[02:23:34.952 --> 02:23:35.812]  We will win.
[02:23:36.012 --> 02:23:36.852]  We will win the fight.
[02:23:37.892 --> 02:23:39.533]  I want to thank you.
[02:23:40.193 --> 02:23:40.773]  Well, I know this.
[02:23:40.793 --> 02:23:41.774]  We've got to do the right thing.
[02:23:41.794 --> 02:23:44.635]  It's going to be a lot better fighting them than rolling over to them.
[02:23:45.075 --> 02:23:46.535]  They've told us no quarter, folks.
[02:23:46.555 --> 02:23:47.555]  That means they're not going to stop.
[02:23:47.576 --> 02:23:51.397]  That means you can get on your knees and they're going to run up and battle you in the head.
[02:23:51.417 --> 02:23:53.077]  Of course, that would be a sweet way to go.
[02:23:53.097 --> 02:23:55.278]  They're going to drug you into oblivion, one-child you.
[02:23:58.353 --> 02:24:02.075]  Let's go ahead and talk to Keith in New Jersey.
[02:24:02.095 --> 02:24:02.515]  Go ahead.
[02:24:03.976 --> 02:24:04.176]  Hello?
[02:24:05.236 --> 02:24:05.797]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:24:05.817 --> 02:24:06.857]  Alright.
[02:24:06.877 --> 02:24:08.778]  A couple things I'll make real quick.
[02:24:08.878 --> 02:24:12.320]  Number one, as far as a lot of people not believing about gun confiscation,
[02:24:12.771 --> 02:24:18.194]  I just found out in Illinois, I'm not sure if you're familiar with CAGE, Chicago Anti-Gun Enforcement.
[02:24:18.214 --> 02:24:19.835]  Yeah, they set CAGE up five years ago.
[02:24:19.875 --> 02:24:27.020]  They go around the minute, you know, 85-year-old World War II veterans' gun permit goes out, they SWAT team their houses and confiscate all the guns.
[02:24:27.700 --> 02:24:29.061]  Yep, they did it again two days ago.
[02:24:29.798 --> 02:24:30.699]  Law-abiding citizen.
[02:24:30.739 --> 02:24:32.280]  Not a gun runner, not a drug dealer.
[02:24:32.680 --> 02:24:33.501]  A law-abiding citizen.
[02:24:33.521 --> 02:24:34.301]  That's the whole point.
[02:24:35.082 --> 02:24:37.704]  Illinois is a great state, great people, but it's run by the mafia.
[02:24:38.024 --> 02:24:42.387]  Going back to the old daily machine, it was a puppet, towards Al Capone and others.
[02:24:42.428 --> 02:24:43.148]  They're not going to stop.
[02:24:44.349 --> 02:24:47.451]  I mean, do you think a guy breaking into your house wants you to be armed?
[02:24:47.752 --> 02:24:48.732]  Criminals run the country.
[02:24:48.752 --> 02:24:49.493]  They want our guns.
[02:24:50.552 --> 02:24:53.253]  What does a criminal do when he robs a bank?
[02:24:53.293 --> 02:24:57.234]  He tells the security guard or the off-duty cop, drop your gun on the ground, put your hands up.
[02:24:57.495 --> 02:24:58.075]  They told us.
[02:24:58.135 --> 02:25:01.176]  They came in, they're sticking us up, they're going, put your guns down on the ground.
[02:25:01.256 --> 02:25:01.876]  It's real simple.
[02:25:03.016 --> 02:25:09.799]  And another thing, since we're using military nomenclature, as far as being special forces, I know a lot of people don't want to take the pot lines on the Infowar.
[02:25:10.179 --> 02:25:12.360]  Here's what I suggest for you college and high school students.
[02:25:13.180 --> 02:25:18.262]  If ever you have to do a report on banking or history, flip in a few things about the New World Order.
[02:25:18.928 --> 02:25:19.989]  At least plant the seeds.
[02:25:20.269 --> 02:25:24.231]  So when people run across this information in the future, they'll be more receptive to it.
[02:25:24.652 --> 02:25:26.693]  Another thing, Christmas is coming up.
[02:25:26.753 --> 02:25:30.015]  Now, I know you've been saying to buy your videos and give them out as gifts.
[02:25:30.255 --> 02:25:30.936]  Here's a better idea.
[02:25:31.696 --> 02:25:32.837]  Buy these three videos.
[02:25:32.997 --> 02:25:36.279]  Loose Change, Freedom of Fascism, Terror Storm.
[02:25:36.879 --> 02:25:38.460]  Find your local police department.
[02:25:38.741 --> 02:25:40.342]  Pick about five or six different cops.
[02:25:41.022 --> 02:25:42.203]  The higher the rank, the better.
[02:25:42.603 --> 02:25:43.163]  And here you go.
[02:25:44.444 --> 02:25:45.985]  And most of the time, they'll thank you.
[02:25:46.345 --> 02:25:47.206]  Everywhere isn't like...
[02:25:49.307 --> 02:25:51.649]  Lion County, Kentucky, where they arrest you, but yeah.
[02:25:52.530 --> 02:25:53.992]  Yeah, and I've done that a couple times.
[02:25:54.492 --> 02:25:57.555]  And last but not least, donate to a couple libraries.
[02:25:58.095 --> 02:26:00.197]  Oh, and also public access.
[02:26:01.479 --> 02:26:05.583]  If you have public access available to you, just run down to your local cable station.
[02:26:05.863 --> 02:26:06.804]  Hey, I like the stone plate.
[02:26:06.824 --> 02:26:08.305]  I don't care if you play it at one in the morning.
[02:26:08.465 --> 02:26:09.206]  Hey, good job.
[02:26:09.266 --> 02:26:09.947]  Good to hear from you.
[02:26:09.987 --> 02:26:10.547]  Gotta jump.
[02:26:10.968 --> 02:26:12.229]  Chris in Texas, go ahead.
[02:26:13.559 --> 02:26:14.219]  Chuck in Texas.
[02:26:14.239 --> 02:26:14.519]  Sorry.
[02:26:15.060 --> 02:26:15.660]  Hi, Alex.
[02:26:16.820 --> 02:26:18.541]  I wanted to make this quick here.
[02:26:19.401 --> 02:26:19.841]  Hey, Chuck.
[02:26:19.861 --> 02:26:21.141]  You hadn't called in about two years.
[02:26:21.161 --> 02:26:21.822]  Good to hear from you.
[02:26:21.882 --> 02:26:22.682]  You remember me.
[02:26:22.762 --> 02:26:23.162]  All right.
[02:26:23.362 --> 02:26:23.882]  I remember you.
[02:26:23.922 --> 02:26:24.903]  You're from San Antonio.
[02:26:24.923 --> 02:26:25.923]  Uh-huh.
[02:26:26.063 --> 02:26:26.783]  That's a fact.
[02:26:27.163 --> 02:26:28.724]  Elephants don't forget, usually.
[02:26:28.744 --> 02:26:35.446]  Yeah, I've been having a lot of stuff going on here.
[02:26:35.966 --> 02:26:37.126]  I understand.
[02:26:37.146 --> 02:26:39.307]  I had to call in on this one.
[02:26:39.467 --> 02:26:40.968]  We had a new police chief.
[02:26:41.328 --> 02:26:41.848]  Oh, about a...
[02:26:42.449 --> 02:26:47.772]  A year ago, William McManus... Yeah, he replaced L.A.
[02:26:47.792 --> 02:26:48.912]  Phillips, the Great American.
[02:26:49.332 --> 02:26:49.572]  Uh-huh.
[02:26:50.293 --> 02:26:58.277]  And now, this guy, he went to cop school there in Washington, D.C.
[02:26:58.357 --> 02:27:01.098]  He was from Dayton, Minneapolis.
[02:27:01.838 --> 02:27:11.123]  And the whole time so far, he only passed his Texas Peace Officers exam, I think it was a couple of days ago.
[02:27:11.892 --> 02:27:19.115]  But they have a story on 8A about how now he's allowed to carry a gun and wear a bag.
[02:27:19.155 --> 02:27:20.576]  Yeah, they train them all in D.C.
[02:27:20.636 --> 02:27:23.677]  or L.A., and most of them are CIA, and they ship them in.
[02:27:24.017 --> 02:27:24.358]  Stay there.
[02:27:24.378 --> 02:27:26.018]  I'm going to let you finish up real quick on the other side.
[02:27:26.338 --> 02:27:28.279]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joins us a lot more.
[02:27:35.883 --> 02:27:36.803]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.283 --> 02:27:38.784]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.800 --> 02:27:42.472]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.589 --> 02:27:53.852]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:27:54.092 --> 02:27:58.453]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:27:58.734 --> 02:28:07.657]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:28:07.857 --> 02:28:11.478]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:28:11.778 --> 02:28:16.803]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:28:17.103 --> 02:28:23.849]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[02:28:24.329 --> 02:28:24.870]  What about you?
[02:28:25.475 --> 02:28:25.995]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.

[02:28:45.570 --> 02:28:47.011]  You can order everything you need on the web
[02:29:04.077 --> 02:29:04.677]  We're good to go.
[02:29:19.602 --> 02:29:20.042]  We're good to go.
[02:29:20.062 --> 02:29:20.483]  We're good to go.
[02:29:20.503 --> 02:29:20.883]  We're good to go.
[02:29:46.678 --> 02:29:52.119]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[02:29:52.539 --> 02:29:57.280]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[02:29:57.660 --> 02:30:00.301]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:30:00.781 --> 02:30:04.202]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:30:04.962 --> 02:30:09.303]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:30:09.743 --> 02:30:12.923]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:30:13.503 --> 02:30:16.364]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:30:17.142 --> 02:30:19.283]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:30:19.323 --> 02:30:21.184]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[02:30:21.304 --> 02:30:21.364]  U.S.
[02:30:21.384 --> 02:30:23.505]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[02:30:23.525 --> 02:30:23.825]  Call 1-888-8XANADU.
[02:30:23.845 --> 02:30:24.726]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[02:30:24.786 --> 02:30:25.266]  Ask for George.
[02:30:48.621 --> 02:31:12.297]  Come your masters of war Here they build the big guns Here they build the death planes Here they build all the bombs Here they hide behind walls Here they hide behind disks
[02:31:14.617 --> 02:31:40.603]  I just want you to know I can see through your masks You that never done nothing but build to destroy You play with my world like it's your little toy You put a gun in my hand
[02:31:42.754 --> 02:32:11.496]  You hide from my eyes You turn and run farther When the fast bullets fly Like Judas of old You lie and deceive A world war can be won You want me to believe But I
[02:32:15.407 --> 02:32:40.914]  And I see through your brain Like I see through the water that runs down my drain You fasten all the triggers For the others to fire And then you sit back and watch
[02:32:42.922 --> 02:33:08.159]  When the death count gets higher Can you hide in your mansion While the young people's blood Flows out of their bodies And is buried in the mud He's thrown the worst fear There can ever be
[02:33:11.673 --> 02:33:12.434]  Welcome back.
[02:33:12.514 --> 02:33:21.380]  I think Bob Dylan says it all there, doesn't he?
[02:33:40.521 --> 02:33:41.982]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joins us.
[02:33:42.042 --> 02:33:48.087]  Barbara, you'll be the only caller I have time to get to because of our guest being here, but I will get to you if you hold in the final segment.
[02:33:48.127 --> 02:33:49.788]  I'd love to hear from you, Barbara, in Texas.
[02:33:50.629 --> 02:33:51.429]  Or is it Tennessee?
[02:33:52.750 --> 02:33:54.852]  I never look at this, my writing right here.
[02:33:55.152 --> 02:33:58.115]  I wanted to get Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on.
[02:33:58.155 --> 02:34:00.757]  He was the head, policy number two, Department of Treasury.
[02:34:01.437 --> 02:34:03.359]  The father of Reaganomics, a real conservative.
[02:34:04.279 --> 02:34:07.081]  I wanted to get him on just to get his take.
[02:34:07.142 --> 02:34:09.103]  I was just talking to him during the break, and I said, we're screwed.
[02:34:09.123 --> 02:34:10.244]  And he said, yeah, we're screwed.
[02:34:11.576 --> 02:34:13.036]  I mean, we're in deep trouble, folks.
[02:34:13.376 --> 02:34:15.337]  The Democrats did worse than I thought they would.
[02:34:15.677 --> 02:34:16.257]  No fence.
[02:34:16.437 --> 02:34:16.977]  We already knew that.
[02:34:16.997 --> 02:34:18.037]  They didn't really fund the fence.
[02:34:20.098 --> 02:34:22.898]  They're going to pass a hate crimes bill banning free speech in America.
[02:34:22.958 --> 02:34:24.979]  Preachers are already being arrested for praying on street corners.
[02:34:25.599 --> 02:34:27.679]  Preachers are already being fined for reading out of the Bible.
[02:34:27.739 --> 02:34:28.720]  This is happening in America.
[02:34:29.080 --> 02:34:30.180]  Not Canada, not Germany.
[02:34:32.300 --> 02:34:35.861]  They are just butchering the entire country.
[02:34:37.645 --> 02:34:40.206]  It's just horrible.
[02:34:40.587 --> 02:34:48.610]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, thank you for joining us and giving us your analysis of the election and where you think things are going from here, sir.
[02:34:50.471 --> 02:34:52.812]  Well, you've made me a seer, have you, Alex?
[02:34:55.874 --> 02:35:04.698]  I don't know that they're going anywhere favorable, but they may not be going as many unfavorable places.
[02:35:05.419 --> 02:35:06.299]  I don't know whether the
[02:35:07.659 --> 02:35:10.180]  Bush regime will be able to attack Iran now.
[02:35:13.402 --> 02:35:17.183]  I think that the people voted against the Republicans.
[02:35:17.203 --> 02:35:19.324]  They did not vote for a Democratic agenda.
[02:35:20.425 --> 02:35:22.866]  And I think they're hoping to get the war over with.
[02:35:23.066 --> 02:35:31.110]  And I think they're concerned about this torture legislation and the detainee legislation.
[02:35:31.170 --> 02:35:34.371]  Because the most serious thing that has happened...
[02:35:36.331 --> 02:35:38.673]  To the United States in my lifetime.
[02:35:39.634 --> 02:35:48.540]  It happened last month when Bush got the detainee legislation passed and the torture legislation passed.
[02:35:48.580 --> 02:36:03.352]  And what this now means is that anyone in the United States, a citizen, a permanent resident, an illegal, anyone can be
[02:36:03.962 --> 02:36:10.349]  designated by any of a large number of government officials and military officers as a suspect.
[02:36:12.251 --> 02:36:19.880]  And if they're so designated, they can be arrested and imprisoned forever.
[02:36:22.442 --> 02:36:26.043]  And administratively have their citizenship revoked.
[02:36:26.103 --> 02:36:30.904]  And then something that kind of went unnoticed was the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007.
[02:36:30.944 --> 02:36:34.604]  That abolishes the governors and posse commentatus.
[02:36:35.064 --> 02:36:39.325]  That's now been analyzed, and top legal scholars on the left and right say it clearly does that.
[02:36:39.765 --> 02:36:44.086]  And now the Democrats, Nancy Pelosi and others, seem like they've circled the wagons with Bush.
[02:36:44.106 --> 02:36:44.486]  You're right.
[02:36:44.506 --> 02:36:45.166]  We sent them there.
[02:36:45.206 --> 02:36:47.867]  People sent them there to stop the war, to repeal that stuff.
[02:36:47.887 --> 02:36:49.527]  And they're saying we're not going to repeal any of it.
[02:36:50.245 --> 02:36:51.766]  And you can go fly a kite.
[02:36:51.806 --> 02:36:52.567]  What do you say to that?
[02:36:54.128 --> 02:37:01.832]  Well, I think we have to take it with a grain of salt until they actually get in office in the next Congress.
[02:37:01.952 --> 02:37:08.437]  Because right now, if they make too many threats, how do you know Bush won't declare martial law and arrest them all?
[02:37:08.777 --> 02:37:10.738]  Or mail more anthrax to the Capitol?
[02:37:11.759 --> 02:37:13.400]  Yeah, right.
[02:37:14.140 --> 02:37:14.680]  You don't know.
[02:37:14.760 --> 02:37:15.661]  I think that they'll...
[02:37:19.575 --> 02:37:20.876]  Well, they're corrupt too, of course.
[02:37:20.956 --> 02:37:35.526]  But I think that they will take some notice of the public and they will not expose themselves to any sort of detrimental position.
[02:37:35.566 --> 02:37:38.888]  So they can't start yelling and screaming now because they're not in power.
[02:37:39.048 --> 02:37:39.748]  Sure.
[02:37:39.988 --> 02:37:43.771]  Congressman Ron Paul, Dr. Roberts...
[02:37:44.560 --> 02:37:55.249]  Also on this show said overall it's good, but how can it be good if they're saying they're going to ram through First Agenda, open borders, amnesty, guest worker, and the hate crimes legislation?
[02:37:56.307 --> 02:38:00.248]  And how can it be good if they're saying they're not going to investigate Bush or not have impeachment?
[02:38:00.848 --> 02:38:03.949]  I mean, you and a few others are saying that maybe they'll do good.
[02:38:04.009 --> 02:38:13.332]  I mean, I'm seeing such unified, since last week on Wednesday, the day after the election, before even the Senate was decided, they were already on the same talking points.
[02:38:13.432 --> 02:38:15.032]  I don't see good indicators there.
[02:38:15.692 --> 02:38:25.335]  Yeah, well, there may not be good indicators, but you can imagine how much worse they would be had the Republicans kept control of the Congress.
[02:38:26.175 --> 02:38:35.258]  So I think that we can have some hope, and of course we do have Kanye's impeachment report, and it's pretty thorough.
[02:38:35.579 --> 02:38:50.004]  So you think that the separation of powers is key, and that the very nature of men and women seeking power, the Democrats won't be able to keep their hands off the zeitgeist, the lever of power, and so just for political selfishness, they're going to launch salvos at Bush?
[02:38:50.624 --> 02:38:55.246]  Yeah, I think that they're as interested in power as he is, and...
[02:38:55.891 --> 02:39:09.529]  They will have it in the Congress and they will probably not, for party reasons, be willing to sacrifice the legislative power to the executive the way the Republicans were.
[02:39:10.851 --> 02:39:13.535]  And I think the war thing is worn off.
[02:39:14.242 --> 02:39:16.222]  And we know it's a disaster.
[02:39:16.562 --> 02:39:24.184]  Do you agree with the analysis that the Baker boys, the oil companies, the cleaners have come in to kind of spank the neocons and now de-escalate things?
[02:39:24.224 --> 02:39:26.984]  Because Israel's saying they may go ahead and attack this month.
[02:39:27.404 --> 02:39:32.425]  Bush said yesterday when he met with the Israeli ambassador that he may go ahead and then back up an attack.
[02:39:32.445 --> 02:39:33.725]  Do you think that's just sword rattling?
[02:39:33.745 --> 02:39:43.347]  Yeah, I think if Bush gets into another war right now when we've already lost two and we don't have any way of getting the troops out of Iraq, home,
[02:39:46.717 --> 02:39:50.138]  That he will push far beyond what he can get away with.
[02:39:50.198 --> 02:39:51.959]  That's just my sense of it.
[02:39:52.860 --> 02:40:03.144]  And I think that the Israelis can create as much hell for themselves until...
[02:40:03.942 --> 02:40:05.162]  They just won't be there.
[02:40:05.522 --> 02:40:12.664]  But if Israel, through insane chutzpah, attacks Iran, that's going to send the world into an economic spiral.
[02:40:12.704 --> 02:40:23.607]  I mean, all of the financial experts have said the dollar's teetering, there's all sorts of serious problems everywhere, and that it's going to cause, that it's guaranteed to trigger a global recession, bare minimum.
[02:40:24.007 --> 02:40:26.688]  Well, it'd be a very reckless thing to do for...
[02:40:27.248 --> 02:40:29.410]  For a number of reasons, and that, of course, would be one of them.
[02:40:29.530 --> 02:40:30.550]  But Israel is reckless.
[02:40:30.590 --> 02:40:34.733]  Why do you think Israel is so... I mean, there's no reason for them to attack Iran.
[02:40:34.773 --> 02:40:35.794]  Why are they so wild?
[02:40:37.715 --> 02:40:39.997]  Well, it's the government they've got now.
[02:40:40.037 --> 02:40:45.501]  It's probably the least competent of all of their incompetent governments.
[02:40:46.682 --> 02:40:52.946]  And it's also... They were trying to seize...
[02:40:53.925 --> 02:41:03.772]  The chance with the neocons in power in America to clean all of their enemies, potential enemies, out of the Middle East.
[02:41:05.113 --> 02:41:18.822]  And what they've done instead is to create that shite crescent that runs now from Iran through southern Iraq into Lebanon and
[02:41:19.557 --> 02:41:38.430]  They have weakened all of our puppets in Egypt and Jordan and Saudi Arabia and Pakistan so that if they keep pushing the way they're doing, attack Iran, we could see regime change in Egypt.
[02:41:39.740 --> 02:41:41.761]  Hosni Mubarak, the lifetime dictator.
[02:41:42.261 --> 02:41:51.387]  Going back, we're talking to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, father of Reaganomics, former Wall Street Journal editor, and number two, Department of Treasury, really the head of the Treasury, the head technician there.
[02:41:52.768 --> 02:41:59.013]  What, I should say, tactician, you've been at the highest levels of government.
[02:41:59.033 --> 02:42:03.836]  You've been around the Republicans that kind of spawned the neocon progeny.
[02:42:05.117 --> 02:42:05.757]  You've been there.
[02:42:05.797 --> 02:42:10.639]  What do you think after this election is going on in the White House right now with their insane hubris?
[02:42:13.019 --> 02:42:15.100]  Well, I think they've been chastened.
[02:42:16.040 --> 02:42:30.665]  And I do think that the old Republican establishment has decided that they can't let this neocon madness continue because it's wrecking the Republican prospects.
[02:42:32.128 --> 02:42:59.816]  So I do think that they will reassert some control, and one consequence, I think, will be the professional bureaucracies in the executive branch will regain some of their power, which has been completely taken away from them by the neocons, so that things will get back into...
[02:43:01.345 --> 02:43:03.487]  More balance and less recklessness.
[02:43:03.907 --> 02:43:06.549]  Dr. Roberts, you agree with me there in the break, though, that we're in a lot of trouble.
[02:43:06.869 --> 02:43:09.471]  I respect a lot of your opinions and your analysis.
[02:43:09.751 --> 02:43:14.274]  You're saying things are looking a little bit better now with what you're saying here on air.
[02:43:14.294 --> 02:43:15.155]  And there is another...
[02:43:15.868 --> 02:43:27.914]  Kind of wild card, joker in all of this, and that's that they were having trouble containing leaks on Planet WMDs and white slave rings and everything else.
[02:43:28.574 --> 02:43:37.539]  Now, with the Democrats coming in, most of the analysts are saying we're going to see an explosion in leakers as the perceived power of the neocons has been dimmed.
[02:43:37.559 --> 02:43:42.101]  How do you think that wild card may play into things?
[02:43:44.008 --> 02:43:51.531]  Well, if the leaks are explosive, it may lead to some serious thought about impeaching Bush.
[02:43:54.992 --> 02:44:07.277]  I agree with you, we're in a serious situation, and the main reason, in my view, we're in a serious situation is we've lost habeas corpus, and we have lost the protection from
[02:44:07.947 --> 02:44:10.169]  Arbitrary and tyrannical government power.
[02:44:10.429 --> 02:44:14.112]  We've had that since 1215 and running the Magna Carta.
[02:44:14.592 --> 02:44:17.775]  I mean, Hillary and the Schumers of the world are going to love having those powers.
[02:44:17.815 --> 02:44:20.517]  The Democrats, I don't think, are going to repeal any of that unless we force them.
[02:44:21.217 --> 02:44:30.084]  Well, you know, the ACLU is very much trying to get these things repealed.
[02:44:30.104 --> 02:44:34.388]  But you know they're infiltrated, and I think they're there to drop the ball and create bad precedent.
[02:44:36.029 --> 02:44:37.050]  Well, I don't know.
[02:44:39.140 --> 02:44:46.487]  In my opinion, all of this happened because of 9-11 and the interpretation put on 9-11.
[02:44:48.089 --> 02:44:50.972]  And it was a cover for stealing...
[02:44:55.567 --> 02:44:57.509]  I agree.
[02:44:57.529 --> 02:44:58.250]  Stealing America.
[02:44:58.290 --> 02:44:59.011]  Here's my question.
[02:44:59.291 --> 02:45:07.963]  If 84% in an Angus and Reed scientific poll conducted for the New York Times and ABC News believe the official 9-11 story is a lie...
[02:45:09.765 --> 02:45:12.166]  I think if there's ever a real investigation of 9-11, it'll break their back.
[02:45:12.186 --> 02:45:12.246]  But
[02:45:39.246 --> 02:45:45.071]  Bush could actually get impeached without 9-11 ever getting officially cleared.
[02:45:45.371 --> 02:45:48.054]  It's like getting Al Capone on tax evasion instead of murder.
[02:45:48.414 --> 02:45:48.654]  Right.
[02:45:49.115 --> 02:45:50.936]  That sort of thing can happen.
[02:45:52.378 --> 02:45:59.444]  You see, Alex, I agree that things are bad and the Democrats are weak-read and unreliable, just like the Republicans.
[02:46:00.125 --> 02:46:00.385]  But...
[02:46:03.226 --> 02:46:11.371]  The consequence of Bush has been to weaken the United States in every respect, financially, economically, diplomatically.
[02:46:11.711 --> 02:46:12.952]  We're more isolated.
[02:46:15.254 --> 02:46:19.256]  We can't pull the same strings and issue the same orders.
[02:46:19.376 --> 02:46:21.097]  We meet resistance in the world.
[02:46:21.117 --> 02:46:23.019]  The soft power has been flushed down the toilet.
[02:46:23.219 --> 02:46:28.362]  The soft power is totally gone, and the hard power is bogged down in Baghdad.
[02:46:28.382 --> 02:46:29.923]  They can't occupy Baghdad.
[02:46:31.021 --> 02:46:32.923]  So how are they going to conquer the Middle East?
[02:46:33.063 --> 02:46:40.188]  And Israel couldn't defeat 5,000 Hezbollah fighters.
[02:46:40.349 --> 02:46:48.815]  So I think that there was a lot of hubris and overreach.
[02:46:50.297 --> 02:46:53.419]  And so we may gain back some of our rights.
[02:46:53.699 --> 02:46:56.421]  And we may actually get some accountability.
[02:46:56.642 --> 02:47:00.685]  Unless they pull a rabbit out of a hat and blow up a city or release a bioweapon.
[02:47:01.264 --> 02:47:09.248]  Well, I think now that's more risky for them to do it because, as you pointed out, many people don't believe them about 9-11.
[02:47:09.288 --> 02:47:14.651]  A repeat performance could be harder to get away with.
[02:47:14.671 --> 02:47:23.236]  Well, that's been my goal every waking hour, waking up in cold sweats, trying to prove it as an inside job to break that tool in front of their faces.
[02:47:23.296 --> 02:47:25.177]  And I think we've, to a great extent, done it.
[02:47:25.277 --> 02:47:27.818]  And I just thank God for everybody's action on that.
[02:47:28.760 --> 02:47:31.342]  But it's like a 12-round heavyweight prize fight.
[02:47:31.382 --> 02:47:34.745]  I mean, we're in the 12th round, but we're both bloody and stumbling around.
[02:47:35.065 --> 02:47:37.727]  Folks, we're far from winning this thing, but we are in the fight.
[02:47:38.688 --> 02:47:51.679]  Yeah, I think there is a fight, and I think that the rest of the world looks askance at the United States and at the Bush administration and at the neoconservatives.
[02:47:52.099 --> 02:47:55.262]  So, in a way, that also...
[02:47:58.286 --> 02:48:03.608]  You see, I mean, Rumsfeld is gone, and they're filing charges against him in Germany.
[02:48:04.149 --> 02:48:09.271]  Now, it may go nowhere, but he'll never know if he travels abroad.
[02:48:09.451 --> 02:48:10.011]  Well, exactly.
[02:48:10.051 --> 02:48:10.651]  You can beat the rap.
[02:48:10.671 --> 02:48:11.932]  But he's going to be picked up somewhere.
[02:48:12.092 --> 02:48:13.933]  You can beat the rap, but you can't beat the ride.
[02:48:13.973 --> 02:48:17.774]  The image of him being indicted, exactly.
[02:48:18.415 --> 02:48:18.855]  That's right.
[02:48:19.475 --> 02:48:21.216]  And this will happen to the rest of them, too.
[02:48:23.158 --> 02:48:31.987]  It'll happen to the rest of them, and none of them will ever be sure where they can go without somebody knocking on their door and arresting them.
[02:48:32.007 --> 02:48:35.370]  Well, it's like Soros and Kissinger already can't go to 50-something countries.
[02:48:36.671 --> 02:48:37.372]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[02:48:37.432 --> 02:48:38.833]  I knew Kissinger had some trouble.
[02:48:38.893 --> 02:48:39.814]  I didn't know about Soros.
[02:48:40.255 --> 02:48:40.575]  Oh, yeah.
[02:48:40.615 --> 02:48:43.518]  We'll be right back with some final comments from Dr. Paul Curtin-Roberts.
[02:48:43.538 --> 02:48:44.359]  We'll also talk to Barbara.
[02:48:48.647 --> 02:48:48.787]  N.S.A.

[02:51:52.362 --> 02:51:55.565]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:57.615 --> 02:51:59.676]  Yeah, for me, it's just watching the Democrats come in.
[02:51:59.697 --> 02:52:04.520]  It's like seeing an old, disgusting neighbor or enemy you thought you'd never have in your life again being back.
[02:52:04.560 --> 02:52:08.382]  And all their little bug eyes and all the sick stuff they do.
[02:52:09.343 --> 02:52:10.924]  They're totally controlled by the globalists.
[02:52:11.724 --> 02:52:14.786]  But, yeah, it is a defeat for the overall agenda.
[02:52:14.806 --> 02:52:18.069]  But the problem is the big banks and the money men and the defense contractors.
[02:52:18.409 --> 02:52:20.690]  They've made their trillions now off this fiasco.
[02:52:21.011 --> 02:52:23.852]  They just kind of blame their front men, the neocons.
[02:52:23.952 --> 02:52:24.293]  But they...
[02:52:25.356 --> 02:52:25.736]  I don't know.
[02:52:25.897 --> 02:52:34.024]  Before we go back to Dr. Roberts and take a final call here, Terror Storm, the last time I checked, was number 17 on the Amazon.com bestseller list.
[02:52:34.044 --> 02:52:36.826]  That is the New York Times video sales list.
[02:52:37.047 --> 02:52:38.208]  We want to push it to number one.
[02:52:38.268 --> 02:52:39.469]  I'm asking you for the help to do it.
[02:52:40.049 --> 02:52:42.672]  It'll be key for getting it placed in more stores around the country.
[02:52:42.712 --> 02:52:43.532]  It's so important.
[02:52:44.013 --> 02:52:44.313]  It's only $12.
[02:52:45.134 --> 02:52:48.137]  It's available at Infowars.com.
[02:52:48.177 --> 02:52:49.738]  Link through over to Amazon.com.
[02:52:49.758 --> 02:52:50.739]  I want to go to number one.
[02:52:51.732 --> 02:52:51.772]  888-253-3139
[02:53:13.677 --> 02:53:18.260]  Dr. Roberts, what do you say to the whole police state, as you said, is still in place?
[02:53:18.940 --> 02:53:23.983]  I mean, sure, the neocons may short-circuit, but the Democrats just take the baton and move forward.
[02:53:24.243 --> 02:53:25.684]  How do we stop Hillary and others?
[02:53:27.625 --> 02:53:28.685]  Well, I don't know.
[02:53:29.486 --> 02:53:40.532]  What we want to do, the most important thing that we do, is to be sure we repeal the detention and torture legislation.
[02:53:41.195 --> 02:53:41.895]  That's essential.
[02:53:41.955 --> 02:53:44.376]  I think it can be done because it's unconstitutional.
[02:53:44.456 --> 02:53:47.016]  I don't even think the current Supreme Court would uphold it.
[02:53:47.196 --> 02:53:50.457]  Did you see the Posse Comitatus annihilation that happened last month?
[02:53:51.357 --> 02:54:00.320]  Well, I think we have to reinstate that as well because we don't want the military serving as domestic police.
[02:54:00.360 --> 02:54:04.320]  But actually, Alex, the police are already militarized.
[02:54:04.501 --> 02:54:05.181]  I know, yeah.
[02:54:05.221 --> 02:54:06.361]  They have these SWAT teams.
[02:54:06.381 --> 02:54:07.781]  They've all got military weapons.
[02:54:08.721 --> 02:54:10.682]  It's already militarized.
[02:54:11.667 --> 02:54:17.532]  And so, in a sense, the posse comitatus is lost with these SWAT teams.
[02:54:18.513 --> 02:54:24.718]  But still, it's the federalization and the integration and Chertoff's integrating in, the CIA.
[02:54:24.758 --> 02:54:25.579]  That's right, Alex.
[02:54:25.599 --> 02:54:32.885]  But just remember, the most important thing is that they can knock on your door right now and carry you off and nobody will ever see you again.
[02:54:32.905 --> 02:54:35.007]  A judge will never know about it.
[02:54:35.047 --> 02:54:36.168]  You'll never appear in court.
[02:54:37.236 --> 02:54:38.697]  That's the most important thing.
[02:54:38.757 --> 02:54:44.259]  This has been impossible since about 1680 in England.
[02:54:45.620 --> 02:54:47.741]  And it's now possible in the United States.
[02:54:47.861 --> 02:54:48.341]  Yes, sir.
[02:54:48.662 --> 02:54:51.363]  I really appreciate you joining us.
[02:54:51.383 --> 02:54:56.886]  I appreciate your patriotism, Dr. Roberts, and I hope to get you back on in the next few weeks for more analysis.
[02:54:57.226 --> 02:55:00.707]  Folks can read your great writing in Lew Rockwell and many other places.
[02:55:00.747 --> 02:55:02.889]  We have stories up on Infowars.com.
[02:55:03.149 --> 02:55:04.029]  Godspeed, my friend.
[02:55:04.289 --> 02:55:05.750]  Well, I know you'll stay on their case.
[02:55:06.340 --> 02:55:07.001]  Oh, don't worry.
[02:55:07.581 --> 02:55:08.863]  I'm a pit bull on their throat.
[02:55:09.183 --> 02:55:09.684]  That's right.
[02:55:09.724 --> 02:55:10.565]  That's where you belong.
[02:55:10.865 --> 02:55:11.546]  God bless you, sir.
[02:55:12.687 --> 02:55:14.348]  All right, let's go to Barbara in Tennessee.
[02:55:14.389 --> 02:55:15.750]  Let him go early so we can talk to you.
[02:55:15.810 --> 02:55:16.250]  Barbara, go ahead.
[02:55:16.270 --> 02:55:16.891]  You've got about a minute.
[02:55:17.672 --> 02:55:18.873]  Hi, Alex.
[02:55:18.913 --> 02:55:24.819]  Listen, I've been listening to you for five years, and I just wanted to let you know my heart breaks, too, for the Iraqi people.
[02:55:25.400 --> 02:55:28.303]  And I also wanted to let you know that I received my...
[02:55:29.878 --> 02:55:32.559]  Freedom to Fascism and the Terror Storm.
[02:55:32.639 --> 02:55:34.600]  I watched Freedom to Fascism last night.
[02:55:34.620 --> 02:55:40.502]  I was so motivated and encouraged just to know that we have someone like Aaron Russo with us in the fight.
[02:55:41.102 --> 02:55:42.682]  And I wanted to share this with everyone.
[02:55:43.523 --> 02:55:44.223]  Bush Sr.
[02:55:44.403 --> 02:55:50.965]  referred to all of us as butchers, which means we're broke, useless, and depressed.
[02:55:51.025 --> 02:55:53.726]  Yeah, he said the butchers on the blogs, yeah.
[02:55:53.986 --> 02:55:57.808]  Yeah, so that's what the arrogant elitists think of us.
[02:55:58.188 --> 02:55:58.328]  And...
[02:55:59.113 --> 02:56:02.837]  We need to keep that in mind and just keep fighting.
[02:56:03.437 --> 02:56:05.759]  Well, it's like James Bond said in that movie.
[02:56:05.779 --> 02:56:06.940]  He said, do you expect me to talk?
[02:56:07.381 --> 02:56:09.443]  And they say, no, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die.
[02:56:09.703 --> 02:56:10.864]  They want to kill us.
[02:56:11.124 --> 02:56:11.585]  That's right.
[02:56:11.785 --> 02:56:12.446]  That's right, Alex.
[02:56:12.686 --> 02:56:14.628]  I'm not joking when I say that, boys and girls.
[02:56:14.848 --> 02:56:15.308]  It's true.
[02:56:15.428 --> 02:56:15.849]  He's right.
[02:56:16.069 --> 02:56:17.250]  Hey, I really appreciate you.
[02:56:17.290 --> 02:56:18.531]  Call me back another time, okay?
[02:56:19.272 --> 02:56:20.133]  And thanks for your support.
[02:56:20.493 --> 02:56:21.574]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:21.614 --> 02:56:22.495]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:22.535 --> 02:56:23.316]  God bless you all.
[02:56:23.336 --> 02:56:24.077]  Get terrorist on.
[02:56:25.979 --> 02:56:26.219]  Or call 877-300-7645.
