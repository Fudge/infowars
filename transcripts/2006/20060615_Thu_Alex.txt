[00:00:05.458 --> 00:00:06.118]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:07.859]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:09.661]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.321 --> 00:00:11.062]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.875 --> 00:00:12.856]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.417 --> 00:00:17.381]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.621 --> 00:00:21.726]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.861 --> 00:00:39.603]  Hard to believe it's already Thursday, the 15th day of June 2006.
[00:00:40.183 --> 00:00:41.684]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:42.324 --> 00:00:45.305]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:47.125]  We've got some great guests coming up for you today.
[00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:48.626]  We'll tell you about a little bit later.
[00:00:49.126 --> 00:00:52.527]  I do want to have wide open phones starting in this first hour.
[00:00:53.748 --> 00:00:56.709]  New York Report denounces shock at school.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.041]  This is out of the Boston Globe.
[00:00:59.562 --> 00:01:03.144]  You would think that they're talking about tasering children.
[00:01:03.184 --> 00:01:03.805]  No, no, no, no.
[00:01:04.265 --> 00:01:08.789]  It is used as discipline for even speaking out in class.
[00:01:09.949 --> 00:01:11.791]  And it's disabled children.
[00:01:12.583 --> 00:01:19.207]  This is the age of bringing forward, quote, Al-Qaeda subjects into trial with giant shock belts on them.
[00:01:19.247 --> 00:01:22.129]  If they don't answer the question right, you zap them.
[00:01:22.589 --> 00:01:24.370]  Well, now it's for our children.
[00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.592]  We'll be getting into this report.
[00:01:26.652 --> 00:01:41.281]  New York education officials issued a scaling report yesterday on a Massachusetts school that punishes troubled and disabled students with electric shocks, finding that they can be shocked for simply nagging the teacher and that some are forced to wear shock devices in the bathtub or shower
[00:01:42.122 --> 00:01:47.851]  We'll be getting into that report also out of U.S.
[00:01:47.911 --> 00:01:48.952]  News and World Report.
[00:01:49.012 --> 00:01:52.217]  Housing bubble correction could be severe.
[00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:53.139]  No kidding!
[00:01:54.412 --> 00:01:56.735]  And an incredible propaganda report here.
[00:01:56.955 --> 00:01:59.838]  This is a press release put out by Marble Comics.
[00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:01.500]  Spider-Man!
[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:02.781]  Spider-Man!
[00:02:03.221 --> 00:02:07.046]  He's a New World Order man, tattling on citizens.
[00:02:07.666 --> 00:02:08.587]  I mean, it's right here.
[00:02:09.048 --> 00:02:10.309]  I'm sorry, I'm torturing you now.
[00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:13.512]  Spider-Man outs himself to the press.
[00:02:13.613 --> 00:02:13.873]  Yes.
[00:02:14.457 --> 00:02:19.981]  For Homeland Security, everyone must register themselves and be tracked, and now Spider-Man doesn't wear a mask.
[00:02:20.061 --> 00:02:22.602]  I mean, it's just guaranteed to be paid for by the government.
[00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:25.484]  This has propaganda placement written all over it.
[00:02:25.864 --> 00:02:27.265]  We're trying to get Marvel Comics on.
[00:02:28.086 --> 00:02:30.787]  Also, ICE arrest about 2,000 illegal immigrants.
[00:02:31.348 --> 00:02:32.849]  This is another staged event.
[00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:35.170]  They arrested, what, 1,000 a month ago?
[00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.952]  If they arrested 1,000 a day for 365 days, an entire year, it would be less than 1%
[00:02:43.613 --> 00:02:45.654]  of the illegal aliens in this country.
[00:02:46.075 --> 00:02:54.259]  So this is more of, oh, we'll put 6,000 troops on the border, and it's 55 in Arizona, 12 in Texas, less than a dozen in New Mexico.
[00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:56.821]  It's just more smoke and mirrors.
[00:02:57.161 --> 00:02:58.562]  Oh, look, Bush is doing something.
[00:02:58.842 --> 00:03:08.888]  Yeah, he's doing something because his approval ratings fell through the floor, and now his approval rating's gone from 28 back up to 31 because he's, at least on the surface, done a few things that sound good.
[00:03:09.168 --> 00:03:10.329]  That's all this is.
[00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.690]  He's trying to get through his American Union,
[00:03:14.028 --> 00:03:14.508]  Right now.
[00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:16.909]  His plan is total amnesty.
[00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:20.390]  This is a smokescreen just to make you feel good while they do this.
[00:03:21.511 --> 00:03:23.331]  Another article here out of the BBC.
[00:03:23.371 --> 00:03:24.372]  Same thing in England.
[00:03:24.752 --> 00:03:26.392]  Migrant amnesty not ruled out.
[00:03:26.412 --> 00:03:29.793]  They're pushing the exact same plan because it's a new world order.
[00:03:29.833 --> 00:03:31.774]  It's happening in every western country.
[00:03:31.814 --> 00:03:34.635]  The exact same thing many times by the very same name.
[00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.452]  FEMA lost $1 billion to fraud and error.
[00:03:37.632 --> 00:03:39.253]  This is out of USA Today.
[00:03:39.733 --> 00:03:42.536]  You see an article like this, and you think, ooh, they really are doing bad.
[00:03:42.976 --> 00:03:47.740]  But then we have $2.3 trillion missing back in 2001 from the Pentagon.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.382]  Another trillion-plus missing since then.
[00:03:50.442 --> 00:03:52.463]  You go, but wait a minute, the whole defense budget is $680 billion.
[00:03:53.624 --> 00:04:01.368]  Well, you see, you had all the pension funds, all the investments, all the savings of over 50 years with the Defense Department, going back to even the War Department.
[00:04:01.668 --> 00:04:02.709]  They have sucked that dry.
[00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:03.309]  It is missing.
[00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:05.750]  So I'd like to see that in the USA today.
[00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.392]  So see, they tell you about a billion, but they don't tell you about the trillions.
[00:04:10.452 --> 00:04:15.635]  Also, this is out of UPI, 9-11 cough, more than just asthma indeed.
[00:04:16.235 --> 00:04:17.816]  It is asbestos.
[00:04:18.316 --> 00:04:21.498]  We will be getting into that report.
[00:04:22.865 --> 00:04:27.767]  Bush and those pesky shades, he likes to tease and make fun of reporters.
[00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:35.150]  If they say sir to him, or if they're shouting out, trying to get a question in and don't say Mr. President, he'll say, hey, it's Mr. President to you.
[00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.191]  Well, he kind of got onto a reporter for wearing sunglasses.
[00:04:38.211 --> 00:04:40.712]  Of course, the man's blind.
[00:04:40.732 --> 00:04:45.794]  The visually impaired tend to wear glasses.
[00:04:47.395 --> 00:04:49.676]  But Lord Bush did not like that.
[00:04:50.606 --> 00:04:53.754]  We'll be playing that audio clip coming up later as well.
[00:04:54.175 --> 00:04:54.937]  Butterfly effect.
[00:04:54.977 --> 00:04:56.581]  New species hatched in lab.
[00:04:56.922 --> 00:04:57.684]  It's terrifying.
[00:04:57.724 --> 00:04:58.486]  It's all coming up.
[00:05:01.141 --> 00:05:09.410]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[00:05:09.611 --> 00:05:11.933]  We're expecting around 1,000 people in attendance.
[00:05:12.554 --> 00:05:21.404]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[00:05:21.904 --> 00:05:25.406]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neo-Con Agenda.
[00:05:25.866 --> 00:05:46.674]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Charnley, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[00:05:46.974 --> 00:05:50.736]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[00:05:51.176 --> 00:05:52.397]  Arm yourself with the truth.

[00:06:09.214 --> 00:06:14.358]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:06:14.698 --> 00:06:23.964]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.

[00:06:29.586 --> 00:06:33.607]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:06:33.807 --> 00:06:38.549]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.

[00:07:01.396 --> 00:07:09.918]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:11.939]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[00:07:12.179 --> 00:07:12.759]  That's 1 in 4 adults.
[00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:16.686]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it.
[00:07:16.986 --> 00:07:19.768]  The American Heart Association calls it the silent killer.
[00:07:20.049 --> 00:07:23.712]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we recognize your concern for your well-being.

[00:08:02.395 --> 00:08:08.416]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.036 --> 00:08:12.057]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:22.179 --> 00:08:23.759]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:08:23.779 --> 00:08:24.980]  until 2 p.m.
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.180]  Central Standard Time.
[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.040]  We're here live.
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.100]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.261]  We are then, of course, back from 9 to midnight.
[00:08:31.721 --> 00:08:33.263]  Central Standard Time.
[00:08:35.124 --> 00:08:37.667]  We are fighting the New World Order at Point Blank Range.
[00:08:37.727 --> 00:08:40.790]  We are having such a huge effect, thanks to you, the listeners.
[00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:57.425]  We're bringing in such a mighty harvest of people waking up that I didn't get any sleep last Wednesday, and I didn't really get any sleep last night on Coast to Coast AM, and then, of course, up and at them after about two hours sleep today, and I'm just excited and blessed and happy to be here.
[00:08:58.286 --> 00:09:02.649]  But I do make the point that I'm becoming a little bit dingy, so bear with me today.
[00:09:02.669 --> 00:09:05.611]  We're going to be taking your calls.
[00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:10.995]  Everybody that is patiently holding the toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:09:11.335 --> 00:09:13.196]  Let me just run through the news right now.
[00:09:14.377 --> 00:09:15.538]  This is out of the Boston Globe.
[00:09:15.598 --> 00:09:18.500]  New York Report announces shock use at school.
[00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:20.132]  Boston Globe.
[00:09:20.212 --> 00:09:36.357]  New York education officials issued a scathing report yesterday on a Massachusetts school that punishes troubled and disabled students with electric shocks, finding that they can be shocked for simply nagging the teacher and that some are forced to wear shock devices in the bathtub or shower, posing an electrocution hazard.
[00:09:37.037 --> 00:09:43.179]  The report, based in part on the inspection last month by the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center in Canton,
[00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:53.356]  Portrayed a school in which most staff lack training to handle the students and seem more focused on punishing bad behavior than encouraging good acts.
[00:09:53.976 --> 00:09:55.037]  See how they spin that?
[00:09:55.137 --> 00:10:01.842]  Oh, they've investigated the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center in Canton and they just need more funding.
[00:10:02.182 --> 00:10:14.092]  The investigator said some forms of discipline, such as a device that delivers shocks at timed intervals, appear to violate federal safety regulations and students live in an atmosphere of pervasive fear and anxieties.
[00:10:14.773 --> 00:10:27.116]  And guaranteed, folks, on average, students in foster care or in the government control, over two-thirds are on an average of seven psychotropic drugs.
[00:10:27.356 --> 00:10:27.936]  Did you hear me?
[00:10:28.396 --> 00:10:29.216]  On average.
[00:10:30.396 --> 00:10:34.397]  Over two-thirds are on drugs and the average is seven drugs.
[00:10:34.877 --> 00:10:36.818]  Some were on 18 drugs.
[00:10:36.858 --> 00:10:42.159]  That's WOAI, TV, San Antonio, Associated Press, UPI.
[00:10:43.019 --> 00:10:43.259]  Okay?
[00:10:44.324 --> 00:10:50.350]  You understand, over two-thirds, an average of seven drugs, some on as many as 18.
[00:10:51.752 --> 00:10:59.419]  Medical doctors are on record that they come in, they take people's children because the parents are quote, abusive, or there were dirty plates in the sink, this is how they do it.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:06.927]  And they immediately, in some cases within 12 months of life, begin hopping them up on one, two, three drugs.
[00:11:06.967 --> 00:11:08.068]  They start going crazy.
[00:11:08.627 --> 00:11:10.688]  Because the drug zone inserts say they will.
[00:11:11.048 --> 00:11:13.589]  Then they put them on more and more drugs and in many cases they die.
[00:11:13.609 --> 00:11:14.770]  They go into seizures then.
[00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:16.290]  They die of drug overdose.
[00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:17.771]  It's all kept very quiet.
[00:11:18.431 --> 00:11:23.033]  And when I talk about honeycombs of toddlers on lithium, I mean that's really happening.
[00:11:23.073 --> 00:11:26.074]  In Florida, it's the worst state that we've looked at.
[00:11:26.594 --> 00:11:30.596]  Texas, Washington State, California, Massachusetts, New York are really bad.
[00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:32.977]  Almost every state is just totally horrible.
[00:11:33.017 --> 00:11:35.078]  But Michigan, I mean, just
[00:11:36.256 --> 00:11:38.857]  Because it's way more than two-thirds in Texas.
[00:11:38.897 --> 00:11:40.097]  We're one of the leaders in this.
[00:11:40.518 --> 00:11:43.559]  And this shows what the government does when it has a captive audience.
[00:11:44.279 --> 00:11:49.581]  And now we have the new Freedom Initiative passed last year for psychological testing of all school children up from age 4 to 18.
[00:11:49.621 --> 00:11:52.582]  Now Illinois has passed a law for all pregnant mothers.
[00:11:52.822 --> 00:11:53.822]  They're trying to implement.
[00:11:53.842 --> 00:11:55.062]  We're fighting it at the state level.
[00:11:56.803 --> 00:12:01.505]  And the drug company's own documents say they're going to go from 15% on drugs in the general public to 50%.
[00:12:03.678 --> 00:12:09.122]  And how great and profitable it'll be, and their stock went up the day after New Freedom passed last year.
[00:12:09.442 --> 00:12:11.143]  I mean, this is what we're dealing with.
[00:12:11.484 --> 00:12:13.165]  Do you understand?
[00:12:16.067 --> 00:12:28.476]  It goes on, the report announced by Rottenberg officials is biased and suspected to play a key role next Monday when education regulators in New York are scheduled to vote on whether to severely restrict the use of painful punishment on students from New York.
[00:12:30.337 --> 00:12:31.478]  This is so classic.
[00:12:32.068 --> 00:12:44.596]  You can't let the coaches, who are the principals in normal schools in the past, take a bad student and give him three pops, and believe me, it doesn't feel good with that big paddle, but it doesn't leave a mark, and then run you until you vomit.
[00:12:45.357 --> 00:12:48.319]  Let me tell you, I was pretty bad my first two years of high school.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:59.786]  Getting in fights, drinking beer, skipping school, smarting off, but I would really be good for about a month after each time I got run until I would vomit.
[00:13:00.706 --> 00:13:02.327]  And this was a public school.
[00:13:03.247 --> 00:13:08.048]  I mean, believe me, after you get paddled, they take you out, and it doesn't matter if class is going on.
[00:13:08.068 --> 00:13:11.889]  Of course, I was in sports, so they could do this to me, but even some people who weren't.
[00:13:11.909 --> 00:13:13.410]  Of course, parents would yell and scream.
[00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:15.490]  That went out right when I was leaving high school.
[00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:17.991]  They quit doing it right when I moved down here to Austin.
[00:13:18.891 --> 00:13:22.892]  But, to make a long story short, the worst part was not getting the pops.
[00:13:22.913 --> 00:13:24.513]  It was being run until I'd throw up.
[00:13:25.675 --> 00:13:34.218]  Run around the sports stadium, run around the quarter mile track as fast as I could being yelled at by one of the assistant coaches.
[00:13:34.238 --> 00:13:40.460]  I remember Coach Webb would lead me out there and have one of the assistant coaches run me until I vomited.
[00:13:43.401 --> 00:13:45.442]  It was either that or get expelled or get suspended.
[00:13:47.542 --> 00:13:48.503]  That was the way to handle it.
[00:13:50.463 --> 00:13:51.904]  By the end of it, that was really good for me.
[00:13:51.924 --> 00:13:52.664]  It wasn't hurting me.
[00:13:53.084 --> 00:13:54.765]  No, we're going to drug you up.
[00:13:55.353 --> 00:14:02.620]  We're going to, statistically it shows it really screws them up, causes more problems, and we're going to put shocking devices on you that you wear all the time.
[00:14:04.642 --> 00:14:07.805]  It is hell on earth, and it's what this government is doing.
[00:14:09.307 --> 00:14:11.749]  Two-thirds of Rottenberg students are sent from New York.
[00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:15.833]  Inspectors said they had notified officials in Massachusetts and the U.S.
[00:14:15.853 --> 00:14:18.876]  Food and Drug Administration about possible violations of state and federal safety rules.
[00:14:20.549 --> 00:14:23.630]  There have been increased allegations of abuse at the Rotenberg Center in recent months.
[00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:25.290]  Let me tell you about New York State.
[00:14:27.171 --> 00:14:39.834]  It's been in the New York Daily News, it's been in several other big New York papers that they don't just take little black children predominantly for some reason and give them toxic AIDS drugs when they don't even have AIDS.
[00:14:40.919 --> 00:14:58.063]  They give them pesticides and I remember reading the New York Daily News a few years ago and having their lawyer on it was admitted the description of the eight-year-old black boy they go to the mother they said we're going to take your two-year-old unless you sign a document giving us your eight-year-old who'd just been in some mild trouble and they murdered him.
[00:14:58.903 --> 00:15:04.225]  This is one case and they took him and they started giving him pesticide and a pesticide test.
[00:15:04.245 --> 00:15:06.145]  They're in a hospital private hospital
[00:15:06.935 --> 00:15:15.802]  And the little boy, of course, over the next two weeks, was in the bed, bedridden, couldn't get up, couldn't move, and then they gave him the final dose, and he died.
[00:15:16.222 --> 00:15:17.643]  And they murder children!
[00:15:17.683 --> 00:15:18.624]  They're murdering them!
[00:15:18.984 --> 00:15:20.105]  Right now, they're not going to stop!
[00:15:20.632 --> 00:15:24.513]  They're not going to stop the child kidnapping rings run by Halliburton and DynCorp.
[00:15:24.793 --> 00:15:26.154]  That's even the Chicago Tribune.
[00:15:26.174 --> 00:15:27.995]  Just all they run, child kidnapping rings.
[00:15:28.015 --> 00:15:32.236]  They have lobbyists on Capitol Hill lobbying against the Pentagon who doesn't want to go along with this.
[00:15:32.836 --> 00:15:33.457]  Chicago Tribune.
[00:15:33.477 --> 00:15:35.057]  See, they're going to kidnap kids.
[00:15:35.077 --> 00:15:36.158]  They're going to snuff film them.
[00:15:36.358 --> 00:15:37.758]  They're going to sell them into sex slavery.
[00:15:37.918 --> 00:15:39.459]  They're going to make them drink pesticide.
[00:15:39.639 --> 00:15:40.179]  They're going to do it.
[00:15:40.856 --> 00:16:05.788]  And they're going to smile at you, and they're going to put cops in black masks at checkpoints on your highways, and they're going to search your house without warrants, and they're going to put your kids on Prozac and Ritalin and lead them into anti-psychotic drugs after that, and they're going to put sodium stannous fluoride in your water, and they're going to put cancer viruses in your vaccines, and they're going to take your pension funds, and they're going to blow stuff up and blame it on imaginary terrorist enemies, and they're going to get rid of our borders, and they're going to create the American Union, and they're going to do it!
[00:16:06.589 --> 00:16:07.129]  So there you go!
[00:16:08.095 --> 00:16:10.977]  Unless we stand up and face the full horror of what's going on.
[00:16:11.417 --> 00:16:15.860]  And I know you're listening, oh they don't take little black kids and give them pesticides until they die.
[00:16:16.121 --> 00:16:17.141]  Yes they do, okay?
[00:16:18.122 --> 00:16:25.967]  And if you argue, people out there that won't check out the facts, that won't believe what I'm saying, that just out of hand say I'm lying, I want to punch you in the face sometimes.
[00:16:26.808 --> 00:16:29.089]  I really get, I get angry, I want to knock your teeth out.
[00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:31.271]  Because you're so stupid.
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:32.881]  You are just scum!
[00:16:32.901 --> 00:16:36.484]  You are dumb, bug-eyed, mindless idiots!
[00:16:36.845 --> 00:16:37.926]  I'm not talking about our listeners.
[00:16:37.966 --> 00:16:40.908]  I'm talking about the idiots that send me emails saying I'm making this up.
[00:16:41.168 --> 00:16:43.010]  I'm not making this stuff up, okay?
[00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:44.191]  I sourced it all!
[00:16:46.213 --> 00:16:58.404]  I can't believe that John Yoo can get up at a CFR meeting and they bring up a memo he wrote saying they're allowed to torture small children in front of their parents sexually, and the guy says, yeah, we are.
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.602]  Okay, and I've even been criticized.
[00:17:02.642 --> 00:17:06.225]  Well, Alex, you're going too far calling John you a criminal, saying he should be arrested.
[00:17:06.465 --> 00:17:08.247]  Well, I mean, what are we supposed to say?
[00:17:11.169 --> 00:17:12.390]  I don't even know what to do anymore.
[00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:16.193]  See, I just read one article and I've literally got over a hundred here in front of me.
[00:17:18.816 --> 00:17:19.636]  It's almost pointless.
[00:17:19.876 --> 00:17:21.218]  What am I even arguing about here?
[00:17:21.498 --> 00:17:23.480]  Why am I even trying to sell this case?
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:24.560]  It's evident.
[00:17:26.882 --> 00:17:27.443]  It's evident.
[00:17:28.211 --> 00:17:29.212]  This article goes on and on.
[00:17:29.232 --> 00:17:30.253]  They just calmly report on it.
[00:17:30.393 --> 00:17:32.414]  Oh, is it abusive to shock them?
[00:17:32.695 --> 00:17:35.497]  To have them in the showers with these shocking devices.
[00:17:35.557 --> 00:17:37.838]  And they just terrorize them.
[00:17:38.199 --> 00:17:44.323]  I mean, we knew years ago that you're five times more likely to die in custody of foster parents in government care.
[00:17:46.125 --> 00:17:48.687]  I'm not saying all foster parents are bad, folks, but the system is bad.
[00:17:49.487 --> 00:17:50.148]  It's a business.
[00:17:50.648 --> 00:17:51.869]  These kids die all the time.
[00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:55.332]  Or they get abused all the time.
[00:17:57.102 --> 00:18:11.194]  But there's all these newscast specials demonizing the few bad genetic parents, you know, real parents out there, and they'll use the horror story all the time of what some horrible parent or grandparents do, and they're scum of the earth too, and they need to be hung.
[00:18:12.235 --> 00:18:14.837]  But then they cover up what the government does!
[00:18:14.857 --> 00:18:17.239]  I mean, I tell you folks, it's bad!
[00:18:17.739 --> 00:18:18.520]  It's real bad!
[00:18:19.614 --> 00:18:21.216]  And it tears my guts out!
[00:18:21.636 --> 00:18:26.460]  It literally, literally makes my stomach hurt when I start focusing on this.
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.923]  That's why a lot of days I have a big stack of news on in front of me.
[00:18:28.943 --> 00:18:31.305]  You notice I just take your calls and have guests on and I don't even get into it.
[00:18:31.545 --> 00:18:33.507]  Because when I read this stuff I have to focus on it.
[00:18:33.787 --> 00:18:34.668]  I have to think about it.
[00:18:35.168 --> 00:18:37.410]  Folks, I have a stack here of over a hundred articles.
[00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:39.332]  They're all just as bad as what I just read.
[00:18:39.352 --> 00:18:41.814]  I have covered one article today.
[00:18:41.834 --> 00:18:43.055]  Okay?
[00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:44.977]  And I have not even hit the tip of the iceberg.
[00:18:45.197 --> 00:18:45.858]  Look at these stories.
[00:18:46.949 --> 00:18:47.649]  Housing bubble.
[00:18:47.689 --> 00:18:48.730]  Correction could be severe.
[00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:49.070]  U.S.
[00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.850]  News & World Report.
[00:18:50.791 --> 00:18:54.212]  A propaganda where Spider-Man now serves Homeland Security and tattles on everyone.
[00:18:54.312 --> 00:18:55.452]  That's new propaganda.
[00:18:56.513 --> 00:18:58.114]  ICE arrests 2,000 illegal immigrants.
[00:18:58.174 --> 00:18:59.554]  Total staged event, nothing.
[00:19:00.294 --> 00:19:01.755]  Migrant amnesty not ruled out.
[00:19:02.615 --> 00:19:04.456]  FEMA lost a billion from fraud and errors.
[00:19:04.476 --> 00:19:07.377]  9-11 caught more than just asthma indeed.
[00:19:07.857 --> 00:19:09.158]  Confirmed to be asbestos.
[00:19:09.458 --> 00:19:12.679]  Thousands of police and firemen and emergency workers already dead and dying.
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.301]  Bush making fun of a blind member of the press.
[00:19:17.841 --> 00:19:18.662]  Butterfly effect!
[00:19:18.702 --> 00:19:20.323]  New species hatched in lab.
[00:19:20.383 --> 00:19:20.983]  London Guardian.
[00:19:22.504 --> 00:19:23.384]  This is insane.
[00:19:23.584 --> 00:19:24.665]  This is so dangerous.
[00:19:26.286 --> 00:19:29.868]  American accomplice of terrorists linked to death squads in Iraq.
[00:19:31.348 --> 00:19:32.089]  Want a new pet?
[00:19:32.129 --> 00:19:33.389]  Get ready to be datamined.
[00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:35.611]  Ramadi.
[00:19:36.031 --> 00:19:37.071]  Belugia redo.
[00:19:37.752 --> 00:19:38.912]  Residents fleeing.
[00:19:39.673 --> 00:19:40.393]  Mass killing.
[00:19:41.874 --> 00:19:43.995]  Flow to deal with police officers.
[00:19:45.296 --> 00:19:48.438]  It's just a bunch of radioactive gases escape a nuclear reactor.
[00:19:48.839 --> 00:19:53.222]  Post-Al-Zaqqari raid kills 104 insurgents.
[00:19:54.122 --> 00:19:56.504]  It just, I mean, it just... We'll be right back.
[00:20:00.149 --> 00:20:03.433]  Do you remember when you could eat most anything and not worry about it?
[00:20:03.914 --> 00:20:06.096]  Or maybe weight management has always been a problem?
[00:20:06.597 --> 00:20:11.984]  Are you frustrated, burned out, and tired of fad diets and marketing gimmicks that don't really work?

[00:21:25.499 --> 00:21:26.439]  This detailed report
[00:21:26.559 --> 00:21:27.160]  We're good to go.
[00:21:59.722 --> 00:22:08.347]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:22:08.567 --> 00:22:19.814]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:22:20.054 --> 00:22:22.696]  Yep, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:22:23.056 --> 00:22:29.520]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.541]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:22:31.741 --> 00:22:37.764]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:22:38.025 --> 00:22:43.668]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[00:22:49.994 --> 00:22:55.320]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:23:14.497 --> 00:23:14.857]  I think so.
[00:23:44.497 --> 00:23:44.757]  Don't worry.
[00:23:44.777 --> 00:23:46.097]  This show is documented.
[00:23:46.138 --> 00:23:47.818]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:23:47.838 --> 00:23:49.679]  I'm gonna take some calls right now.
[00:24:14.244 --> 00:24:18.408]  And then I want to get into this new butterfly they've created.
[00:24:19.248 --> 00:24:20.609]  A completely new species.
[00:24:22.671 --> 00:24:31.359]  On the streets of Hong Kong and South Korea you can buy, and Japan and Tokyo, you can buy little rhesus monkeys that glow in the dark bright green.
[00:24:31.819 --> 00:24:32.880]  They are part jellyfish.
[00:24:33.539 --> 00:24:37.022]  You can buy other genetically engineered creatures in the bazaars.
[00:24:37.602 --> 00:24:46.088]  This is the type of wild cross-species stuff going on that top scientists admit could give rise, and has given rise, to super viruses and other nightmares.
[00:24:46.168 --> 00:24:51.172]  But now they're doing something even more dangerous, totally new creations, not just cross-species.
[00:24:52.913 --> 00:24:54.054]  It's just so out of control.
[00:24:54.134 --> 00:24:55.254]  Everything is out of control.
[00:24:55.835 --> 00:24:56.595]  Let's go ahead.
[00:24:56.896 --> 00:24:57.716]  Who's up first here?
[00:24:59.317 --> 00:25:01.079]  Leslie in Virginia, you're on the air.
[00:25:01.139 --> 00:25:01.459]  Welcome.
[00:25:02.079 --> 00:25:03.100]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:25:03.633 --> 00:25:10.038]  I just want you to know if we don't get more involved, you're going to have three times the stack that you have right now today.
[00:25:10.478 --> 00:25:11.759]  But there is an answer to this.
[00:25:12.219 --> 00:25:23.067]  The answer is your speech that you gave in front of the Bilderberg meeting because what that speech did was most importantly inspirational.
[00:25:23.447 --> 00:25:30.312]  But as you know, it takes so much time and personnel and research to get to the bottom line.
[00:25:30.777 --> 00:25:35.080]  And what your speech did was consolidate the information very quickly.
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.902]  And we are talking about a few minutes.
[00:25:38.702 --> 00:25:48.048]  And if we can pass that speech out to as many people as we can, we will defeat the new world order quickly.
[00:25:49.355 --> 00:25:52.636]  Well, I think that information is the key.
[00:25:52.656 --> 00:25:53.896]  I think it's a small part of it.
[00:25:53.916 --> 00:26:01.518]  I think it is a good, concise, nine-minute, thirty-something second expose and it has gone crazy on the internet.
[00:26:01.819 --> 00:26:11.921]  Yes, because if people ask questions, what is he talking about or whatever, but see, people want to get to the bottom line and we don't have time and that's the value of your speech.
[00:26:12.262 --> 00:26:12.922]  Well, I agree with you.
[00:26:12.982 --> 00:26:14.782]  I think it's a good piece.
[00:26:15.502 --> 00:26:15.903]  It's excellent.
[00:26:15.943 --> 00:26:17.223]  It gets to the bottom line quickly.
[00:26:17.797 --> 00:26:25.364]  And so people can go out there and discover things on themselves, but it gives them the tools to work with, number one.
[00:26:25.864 --> 00:26:26.825]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[00:26:27.085 --> 00:26:28.586]  Thank you, I appreciate the call.
[00:26:29.467 --> 00:26:31.288]  Eric in California, you're on the air.
[00:26:31.989 --> 00:26:33.290]  Hey, Donald, I just want to say one thing.
[00:26:33.891 --> 00:26:39.996]  You know, the most dangerous thing in the world besides this New World Order is the fact that when people think for themselves,
[00:26:40.888 --> 00:26:41.669]  That creates power.
[00:26:41.729 --> 00:26:51.098]  That is what people are afraid of, is that doing what's right, doing what's good, and I just want to thank you, one thing is that for having this show, but the thing I really want to get into is this Abestos thing.
[00:26:51.378 --> 00:27:05.992]  I hope I'm not skipping subjects, but the Abestos, do you believe that with the Abestos infecting a lot of the New York police officers and the firefighters, that this is actually more information, and I'm not, you know, I'm not trying to be really naive on this, that
[00:27:06.843 --> 00:27:10.209]  That there are actually bombs in the World Trade Center?
[00:27:10.409 --> 00:27:12.212]  Well, of course it is!
[00:27:12.253 --> 00:27:12.834]  That's why...
[00:27:14.087 --> 00:27:16.989]  No modern steel building had ever collapsed from fire.
[00:27:17.069 --> 00:27:21.132]  Three of them did that day, and then they were pulverized into minute dust.
[00:27:21.192 --> 00:27:24.614]  It's been tested, and we know the buildings were full of asbestos.
[00:27:24.654 --> 00:27:34.381]  The columns were jacketed with asbestos, not to mention the thousands of smoke detectors and thermostats that had mercury in them that was aerosolized.
[00:27:35.001 --> 00:27:36.923]  And new scientists, what, three years ago, did
[00:27:38.163 --> 00:27:43.868]  Did lung scans, CAT scans, huge fogs in all their lungs of this toxic stuff.
[00:27:44.628 --> 00:27:50.073]  New York Daily News, again, did a test of some of the firefighters and police.
[00:27:50.833 --> 00:27:54.736]  And the head of the EPA at the time, just a few months after, said, yeah, there's a huge disaster.
[00:27:54.757 --> 00:27:57.859]  We need $97 million for the police and firemen and rescue workers.
[00:27:57.919 --> 00:27:59.881]  And Bush had her reverse that report.
[00:28:00.361 --> 00:28:01.462]  And that's all come out now.
[00:28:01.602 --> 00:28:04.945]  So I keep telling the police and the people that serve this government,
[00:28:05.777 --> 00:28:10.359]  At the end of World War II, Stalin got 22,000 plus U.S.
[00:28:10.379 --> 00:28:14.641]  troops out of Nazi camps, and he just used them for slave labor and medical experiments.
[00:28:14.661 --> 00:28:16.822]  That's declassified, and our government just said, keep them!
[00:28:17.262 --> 00:28:20.844]  I mean, people don't think they killed 2,800 of us on 9-11.
[00:28:21.224 --> 00:28:22.444]  What are you talking about, folks?
[00:28:22.464 --> 00:28:24.165]  They'll just write off 22,000 Army and, of course,
[00:28:29.446 --> 00:28:34.869]  Mainly Army, some Navy, some Air Force that were shot down, some of them Marines, but 22,000 of them.
[00:28:35.469 --> 00:28:37.110]  I mean, that's how evil these people are.
[00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:38.510]  It is exactly evil.
[00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:40.151]  The whole thing with the New Order, it's a business.
[00:28:40.351 --> 00:28:41.351]  It's just like a write-off.
[00:28:41.391 --> 00:28:41.812]  That's all it is.
[00:28:41.852 --> 00:28:43.352]  Oh, we had some losses and stuff like that.
[00:28:43.372 --> 00:28:43.793]  It's okay.
[00:28:44.033 --> 00:28:45.613]  They don't have a conscience, and that's what I want to say.
[00:28:45.653 --> 00:28:46.414]  They don't have a conscience.
[00:28:46.434 --> 00:28:47.074]  People, stand up.
[00:28:47.394 --> 00:28:48.014]  I love my country.
[00:28:48.054 --> 00:28:48.715]  Thank you so much.
[00:28:48.835 --> 00:28:49.155]  God bless.
[00:28:50.504 --> 00:28:50.944]  Thank you.
[00:28:51.164 --> 00:28:52.605]  I mean, think about that.
[00:28:53.225 --> 00:28:54.065]  Project Shad.
[00:28:54.105 --> 00:28:54.825]  Type it in Google.
[00:28:54.845 --> 00:28:55.985]  You'll get AP Reuters.
[00:28:56.405 --> 00:28:58.786]  I've had members, officers who worked there.
[00:28:59.066 --> 00:29:00.246]  They'd have them sit out in a ship.
[00:29:00.306 --> 00:29:02.327]  Jets would fly over low, spray nerve gas on them.
[00:29:02.687 --> 00:29:03.787]  Some people would die that day.
[00:29:03.827 --> 00:29:04.507]  Some a week later.
[00:29:04.567 --> 00:29:06.348]  Some have all these birth defects when they had children.
[00:29:07.368 --> 00:29:11.229]  They'd come into port in Hawaii and they'd moor them out away from everybody.
[00:29:11.289 --> 00:29:12.289]  No one would get near the ship.
[00:29:12.975 --> 00:29:14.916]  People wouldn't even, you know, the word was out.
[00:29:14.936 --> 00:29:16.096]  No one would even shake their hand.
[00:29:16.116 --> 00:29:17.516]  They'd spray biologicals on them.
[00:29:17.796 --> 00:29:18.677]  They did it at U.S.
[00:29:18.717 --> 00:29:20.337]  military bases, British bases.
[00:29:22.057 --> 00:29:33.581]  I mean, it's been declassified that Roosevelt left 7,400 Americans in the Philippines by design, ordered the Marines not to let them evacuate a month before, because they said, oh, this will be great when the Japanese capture men, women, and children.
[00:29:33.601 --> 00:29:34.661]  That'll be good for newsreels.
[00:29:35.161 --> 00:29:37.002]  Over half of them were killed or died in the camps.
[00:29:37.422 --> 00:29:38.522]  That's 4,000 plus.
[00:29:39.402 --> 00:29:40.723]  See, just for some propaganda.
[00:29:40.743 --> 00:29:40.723]  7,000.
[00:29:40.763 --> 00:29:40.863]  Boom.
[00:29:43.932 --> 00:29:44.513]  Just boom.
[00:29:45.394 --> 00:29:45.975]  Think about that.
[00:29:46.335 --> 00:29:46.936]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:49.639 --> 00:29:50.520]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.021 --> 00:29:52.622]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.544 --> 00:29:56.247]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.381 --> 00:30:05.705]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:30:06.065 --> 00:30:10.748]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Wright Frequency Technology.
[00:30:11.069 --> 00:30:18.733]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Wright discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:30:19.014 --> 00:30:25.858]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:30:26.098 --> 00:30:27.459]  There are no side effects!
[00:30:27.799 --> 00:30:31.422]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:30:31.702 --> 00:30:38.786]  BioSolutions has over 550 programmed auto sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:30:39.047 --> 00:30:42.069]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[00:30:42.469 --> 00:30:44.991]  Ask about our spring special now in progress.

[00:30:55.116 --> 00:30:58.877]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:30:59.337 --> 00:31:01.298]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[00:31:01.398 --> 00:31:12.081]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:12.461 --> 00:31:16.986]  The Murky's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the white murky purification element.
[00:31:17.067 --> 00:31:28.400]  When used, water flow through the purification elements, where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:35.822]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:31:36.223 --> 00:31:38.363]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:31:38.863 --> 00:31:43.825]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.
[00:31:44.125 --> 00:31:50.287]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:50.307 --> 00:31:51.408]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you!
[00:31:51.468 --> 00:31:52.308]  That's toll free!
[00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:01.672]  Come on, Bill.
[00:32:01.872 --> 00:32:07.056]  Two weeks ago you were riding a bicycle, and today you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house?
[00:32:07.396 --> 00:32:08.877]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[00:32:08.977 --> 00:32:10.958]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[00:32:11.238 --> 00:32:16.741]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:32:17.042 --> 00:32:23.305]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[00:32:23.626 --> 00:32:25.807]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[00:32:26.107 --> 00:32:29.531]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week!
[00:32:29.771 --> 00:32:30.232]  Whoa!
[00:32:30.592 --> 00:32:31.773]  What was that website again?
[00:32:31.873 --> 00:32:35.357]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:32:35.657 --> 00:32:36.779]  Now write this down, John.
[00:32:36.919 --> 00:32:41.203]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[00:32:41.363 --> 00:32:41.944]  Thanks, Bill.
[00:32:42.224 --> 00:32:43.406]  I'm going there right now.
[00:32:43.826 --> 00:32:44.467]  Check, please!
[00:32:46.254 --> 00:32:47.696]  Uh, you got this one, right Bill?
[00:32:48.196 --> 00:32:48.777]  Sure, John.
[00:32:48.997 --> 00:32:53.381]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:32:53.662 --> 00:32:55.363]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[00:32:55.523 --> 00:32:55.804]  Deal?
[00:33:09.251 --> 00:33:13.015]  If it keeps on raining, love is gonna break.
[00:33:13.755 --> 00:33:18.400]  When the levee breaks, the New World Order will have no place to stay.
[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:20.101]  It's going down.
[00:33:20.121 --> 00:33:22.083]  It's going down now.
[00:33:22.103 --> 00:33:23.444]  It's going down.
[00:33:23.464 --> 00:33:29.570]  I want to have another message here for the police out there, people that serve this system.
[00:33:30.387 --> 00:33:34.248]  I know a lot of police change tires, help little old ladies, are great people.
[00:33:34.288 --> 00:33:36.769]  But the system itself, the training, is bad.
[00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:39.590]  They're trying to turn the police, the military, against the people.
[00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:40.350]  That's on record.
[00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:41.711]  That's legion, the evidence of that.
[00:33:42.911 --> 00:33:43.751]  But think about this.
[00:33:43.811 --> 00:33:45.312]  They tell you, oh, you've got to be mean.
[00:33:45.332 --> 00:33:46.192]  We've got to stick together.
[00:33:46.232 --> 00:33:48.953]  We're a thin blue line, or a thin black ski mask line now.
[00:33:49.413 --> 00:33:50.633]  A thin checkpoint line.
[00:33:51.334 --> 00:33:52.574]  We've got to manage the people.
[00:33:52.614 --> 00:33:53.494]  They're a bunch of idiots.
[00:33:53.514 --> 00:33:55.255]  We've got to control them for their own good.
[00:33:56.497 --> 00:33:59.488]  Everything we do, officers, is for your safety and for your good.
[00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.712]  It's a lie!
[00:34:01.787 --> 00:34:03.108]  It's a lie, officers.
[00:34:03.208 --> 00:34:04.549]  They keep control of you.
[00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:14.757]  Did you know the average officer writes over $250,000 worth of tickets, brings in that type of fines, but oh, you get paid $35,000 a year on average?
[00:34:14.777 --> 00:34:16.998]  See, there's another example.
[00:34:17.359 --> 00:34:24.784]  And when you breathe asbestos and all these poisons, still New York police would march up to me and be rude to me, exposing 9-11 as an inside job.
[00:34:24.824 --> 00:34:28.367]  Some of them were nodding and agreeing, but about half of them were vicious attack dogs.
[00:34:29.265 --> 00:34:33.326]  Again, you love being slaves, you love being lied to, you love being scammed.
[00:34:34.286 --> 00:34:36.687]  Now is the time for you to wake up.
[00:34:36.987 --> 00:34:38.827]  Let's take some more calls and we'll get back into the news.
[00:34:38.887 --> 00:34:40.168]  Paula in Florida, go ahead.
[00:34:40.188 --> 00:34:44.769]  Do we have Paula?
[00:34:45.969 --> 00:34:49.350]  The state just verified what you said about the drugs for the children.
[00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:54.271]  The state rep, Senator Lenzoff, just verified it and said they're trying to do something about it.
[00:34:55.393 --> 00:35:01.018]  And I've notified all the reps in Washington about the North American Union you've been talking about.
[00:35:01.038 --> 00:35:02.159]  None of them knew about it.
[00:35:02.719 --> 00:35:04.220]  I even called the House to let them know about it.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.502]  They're liars!
[00:35:06.562 --> 00:35:08.244]  They've had a joint session of Congress.
[00:35:08.264 --> 00:35:10.005]  In fact, two of them in Mexico.
[00:35:10.866 --> 00:35:13.008]  Well, some of the ones I talked to didn't know about it.
[00:35:13.601 --> 00:35:14.141]  They're liars.
[00:35:14.382 --> 00:35:17.184]  Well, anyway, hun, I'll tell you what, we need you as president right now.
[00:35:17.884 --> 00:35:18.625]  Thanks for the call.
[00:35:18.665 --> 00:35:19.545]  And I'm serious, hun.
[00:35:19.865 --> 00:35:21.046]  Okay, thank you, Paula.
[00:35:21.727 --> 00:35:24.409]  I'm not old enough to be president, and I'm never going to run for president.
[00:35:24.869 --> 00:35:25.930]  If we're 35, I'm 32.
[00:35:28.011 --> 00:35:30.133]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in New Mexico.
[00:35:30.193 --> 00:35:31.073]  Steve, you're on the air.
[00:35:31.514 --> 00:35:32.014]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:35:32.034 --> 00:35:42.101]  You know, I was in Tucson Monday night listening to the news, and there was a police spokesman on there, and he said that the police were going to start confiscating
[00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:44.471]  By the way, he got caught there in Ohio
[00:36:10.443 --> 00:36:11.443]  Exposing all of this.
[00:36:11.603 --> 00:36:14.984]  We've got him coming on tomorrow, full name, full information.
[00:36:15.945 --> 00:36:22.306]  He came into his office and there was a stack of documents and news articles on his desk telling him, we know what you've done.
[00:36:22.326 --> 00:36:32.869]  And for those that don't know, they're training the preachers in 13,000 plus counties to train the public to accept gun confiscation, martial law, forced relocation, quarantines, you name it.
[00:36:33.489 --> 00:36:35.310]  Okay, so here's the first time I've seen it.
[00:36:36.471 --> 00:36:43.177]  The police have been told by Homeland Security that there's going to be martial law in October and start gun confiscation now.
[00:36:43.698 --> 00:36:45.780]  They're actually doing gun confiscation at this time.
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:46.901]  Now, where is this?
[00:36:47.221 --> 00:36:47.621]  Tucson.
[00:36:48.502 --> 00:36:50.584]  It was in the paper that they actually had.
[00:36:50.624 --> 00:36:51.585]  I'll send you the article.
[00:36:52.426 --> 00:36:54.047]  Well, tell me the headline and we can find it.
[00:36:55.529 --> 00:36:56.389]  Which Tucson paper?
[00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:57.330]  Daily Star.
[00:36:58.551 --> 00:36:59.292]  Ok, what's the headline?
[00:37:01.904 --> 00:37:09.129]  I think it was on Tuesday and it said something to the effect of, that I can remember, because I didn't actually... Oh yeah, I do have it.
[00:37:09.149 --> 00:37:09.769]  I'm going to think of it.
[00:37:10.289 --> 00:37:11.110]  Here it is.
[00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:19.115]  Police confiscate guns, illegal guns, from criminals to prevent use of many crimes.
[00:37:19.335 --> 00:37:19.955]  Okay, stop.
[00:37:20.275 --> 00:37:21.356]  I've got to write this headline down.
[00:37:22.257 --> 00:37:25.599]  Police confiscate illegal guns from criminals.
[00:37:26.659 --> 00:37:27.020]  Okay?
[00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:28.501]  So they can't be used in October.
[00:37:29.261 --> 00:37:30.662]  Police confiscate illegal guns
[00:37:31.894 --> 00:37:33.814]  From criminals.
[00:37:34.134 --> 00:37:38.155]  Okay, I will, uh, that was, you believe, Tuesday in the Daily Star?
[00:37:38.295 --> 00:37:38.835]  That's correct.
[00:37:39.695 --> 00:37:41.496]  Okay, I will Google it and try to find that.
[00:37:41.796 --> 00:37:42.476]  Thank you, sir.
[00:37:42.676 --> 00:37:44.816]  What specifically did they say when you saw him on the news?
[00:37:45.576 --> 00:37:55.058]  Uh, he basically was trying to tell us that they expect criminals to use their gun, their criminal guns, or illegal guns, uh, you know, to commit crimes in October.
[00:37:55.358 --> 00:37:56.798]  And I thought, I just couldn't believe it!
[00:37:57.399 --> 00:37:59.459]  That, you know, he was giving us a specific date.
[00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:02.331]  But the gun confiscation, he said, was occurring now.
[00:38:03.231 --> 00:38:08.613]  He did make a comment, you know, that they're looking for criminals with guns right now.
[00:38:09.174 --> 00:38:09.914]  And it sounds good!
[00:38:09.974 --> 00:38:10.914]  I mean, that's for the public good.
[00:38:10.934 --> 00:38:17.257]  Well, what they're doing is, from Kentucky to where you live, and I have seen this in the news, we now confirmed some of these reports,
[00:38:17.865 --> 00:38:21.750]  VATF, National Guard is there, police, and it started.
[00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:25.794]  Bush has doubled the funding for VATF going back four years ago, and it's happening.
[00:38:26.115 --> 00:38:26.635]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:38:26.715 --> 00:38:31.060]  I think they're using roadblocks, but I haven't seen any yet, and they haven't made any comments about roadblocks.
[00:38:31.641 --> 00:38:33.904]  But that's obviously their first choice.
[00:38:34.412 --> 00:38:39.974]  Well, what that means is, when they say criminals with guns, they mean people carrying guns illegally, who don't even have criminal records.
[00:38:40.094 --> 00:38:43.116]  Oh, this is loaded in your glove compartment, you're going to prison.
[00:38:43.676 --> 00:38:50.839]  Oh, this is, oh, you, you know, you had a... Yeah, but it's specifically in the law that it is legal to carry a loaded gun on your person.
[00:38:51.019 --> 00:38:51.699]  In Arizona.
[00:38:52.059 --> 00:38:52.640]  In Arizona.
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:57.362]  It's an open carry state, and you can carry it in there, concealed in your glove box, without a permit.
[00:38:57.662 --> 00:38:58.962]  Yeah.
[00:38:59.082 --> 00:39:00.223]  I don't know what they're going to try then.
[00:39:00.363 --> 00:39:01.883]  I will check that headline out.
[00:39:01.923 --> 00:39:02.404]  Anything else?
[00:39:02.744 --> 00:39:03.284]  That's all I have.
[00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:04.361]  Thank you, sir.
[00:39:04.981 --> 00:39:10.205]  So the headline, Tucson Daily Star, police confiscate illegal guns from criminals.
[00:39:10.485 --> 00:39:15.288]  I wonder if it says in the article in October.
[00:39:16.289 --> 00:39:16.629]  Oh boy.
[00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:24.035]  And I'm not saying something's going to happen in October, but we have confirmed from the FEMA documents, they're telling them they've got to be ready by October.
[00:39:24.975 --> 00:39:28.218]  Is that when they're going to attack Iran and then blow stuff up and blame it on Iran?
[00:39:28.258 --> 00:39:29.299]  Or will Iran really do it?
[00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:31.080]  Oh man.
[00:39:32.355 --> 00:39:33.735]  This is so out of control.
[00:39:34.516 --> 00:39:35.836]  Jim in Texas, go ahead.
[00:39:35.856 --> 00:39:37.456]  Hey, Alex.
[00:39:38.316 --> 00:39:38.556]  Hi.
[00:39:39.517 --> 00:39:51.900]  Hey, uh, you know, I used to take the Daily Newspaper on a subscription basis and it made me so depressed and demoralized and it just discouraged me to read it.
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:59.261]  When you go through the headlines like that, it really, uh, really depresses me.
[00:40:00.162 --> 00:40:01.962]  And of course, but,
[00:40:03.422 --> 00:40:11.189]  I go ahead and I buy the newspaper anyway off the stand every day at a store just because I want to see what they're up to.
[00:40:11.889 --> 00:40:20.856]  You know, you've got to keep an eye on them and watch them closely and of course read between the lines because you won't really know what they're doing by reading the paper.
[00:40:21.377 --> 00:40:28.062]  But you know, as bad as it is Alex and his
[00:40:29.113 --> 00:40:35.159]  Depressed and melancholy that they make us, you know, with the fear that they're trying to instill and all that.
[00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:48.931]  This thing, as you know, is really... The fight that we're in now and the bigger fight coming up is actually, ironically, it's invigorating and energizing.
[00:40:51.153 --> 00:40:51.413]  You know?
[00:40:51.914 --> 00:40:55.357]  Because you see this bully in front of us
[00:40:55.928 --> 00:40:59.369]  And you know we're going to take him down or at least inflict some damage.
[00:41:00.769 --> 00:41:03.270]  And that's, you know, that's a reward in itself.
[00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:04.230]  I hear you.
[00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:06.591]  I hear you and I... Go ahead and finish up.
[00:41:07.151 --> 00:41:15.773]  It's the opposite of, you know, how they make you feel all sad and, you know, the death of our country and the way their crimes are committing.
[00:41:15.833 --> 00:41:19.594]  It just puts you in a depressed state of mind.
[00:41:19.674 --> 00:41:25.375]  But then when you really think about it, how we're going to go after him and at least resist.
[00:41:26.058 --> 00:41:27.659]  Well, that's it.
[00:41:27.879 --> 00:41:29.620]  At least we're standing up on our hind legs.
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:31.220]  I appreciate the call.
[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:34.622]  Listen, people say, Alex, be more positive.
[00:41:34.662 --> 00:41:35.742]  Focus on the positive.
[00:41:36.443 --> 00:41:45.867]  We've gotten in this position by ignoring the facts, by letting things get worse and worse, by rationalizing, by making excuses, by convincing ourselves that everything's okay.
[00:41:45.907 --> 00:41:49.829]  It's very positive that we're on air speaking the truth.
[00:41:50.309 --> 00:41:54.911]  It's wonderful that so many big government servants, what they call officials,
[00:41:56.286 --> 00:41:56.746]  We're good to go.
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:18.201]  So that's really intimidating to globalists.
[00:42:18.221 --> 00:42:19.722]  They thought they would just do all this.
[00:42:19.742 --> 00:42:20.963]  They got away with it for so long.
[00:42:21.003 --> 00:42:36.671]  But as I said 10 years ago on air, as this thing starts really clicking, as it really goes into position, as they launch their attack, as they snap the football, and as the ball goes into play, which it is now, all bets are off.
[00:42:37.112 --> 00:42:38.793]  They don't know what's going to happen.
[00:42:39.753 --> 00:42:42.395]  And we've got a fighting chance here.
[00:42:43.362 --> 00:42:47.303]  That's why I'm risking my life, that's why I'm doing what I'm doing, because these people are sicko criminals.
[00:42:47.964 --> 00:42:50.144]  They've got to be stood up to, and we're doing that right now.
[00:42:50.184 --> 00:42:51.905]  This is the defense against the New World Order.
[00:42:52.265 --> 00:42:59.147]  This is a wartime broadcast against the criminals that have seized control of our government, and are fooling most good people that are in the government, just like most of the general public.
[00:42:59.567 --> 00:43:03.689]  Aren't overtly evil people, they're just naive, juvenile idiots.
[00:43:06.696 --> 00:43:09.859]  To even try to chronicle their admitted crimes, their admitted lies.
[00:43:09.919 --> 00:43:14.242]  I mean, how many times do they have to get caught red-handed, premeditated lying?
[00:43:14.262 --> 00:43:16.404]  It isn't like they were just wrong about WMDs.
[00:43:16.704 --> 00:43:18.045]  They premeditatedly lied about it.
[00:43:18.586 --> 00:43:19.867]  They lie about everything.
[00:43:20.567 --> 00:43:22.949]  It's a joke how much they lie.
[00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:24.411]  It's just ridiculous.
[00:43:26.833 --> 00:43:29.635]  And it's so sad that all of this is happening.
[00:43:31.201 --> 00:43:33.162]  Let's talk to Charles in Louisiana.
[00:43:33.202 --> 00:43:34.083]  Charles, go ahead.
[00:43:34.443 --> 00:43:36.164]  Uh, Mr. Jones, I'm sorry about my phone.
[00:43:36.684 --> 00:43:37.885]  Monday, it clicked out.
[00:43:39.245 --> 00:43:40.526]  You know, you told me to put it on hold.
[00:43:40.726 --> 00:43:41.246]  It clicked out.
[00:43:41.467 --> 00:43:41.787]  Okay.
[00:43:42.027 --> 00:43:43.328]  Anyway, look, I want to thank you.
[00:43:44.088 --> 00:43:46.109]  God, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[00:43:46.709 --> 00:43:49.071]  For when you went to the Billaburgers and you stood up to them.
[00:43:49.671 --> 00:43:51.552]  Mr. Jones, you just energized me.
[00:43:51.572 --> 00:43:55.674]  I mean, man, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[00:43:55.994 --> 00:43:57.355]  You truly are American.
[00:43:58.096 --> 00:43:58.736]  You truly are.
[00:44:00.546 --> 00:44:02.489]  Well, I'm just doing my job, just like you, Charles.
[00:44:02.849 --> 00:44:04.772]  Well, I want to tell something to the people, though.
[00:44:04.792 --> 00:44:10.039]  The ones that don't want to fight, the ones that won't fight, they got something for you.
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:11.261]  And I know I've been there.
[00:44:11.942 --> 00:44:14.826]  You think you're going to just slip out of this and let some of them fight for you?
[00:44:15.305 --> 00:44:17.886]  But when you go to them prisons, you're going to know what's going to happen.
[00:44:18.206 --> 00:44:22.048]  You're going to eat rotten meat, and they're going to talk to you like they did Mr. Jones.
[00:44:22.508 --> 00:44:24.609]  And then your children, you ain't going to know where they're at.
[00:44:24.989 --> 00:44:26.130]  These people ain't nice.
[00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:29.631]  You might think you can run and hide, but they love weak people.
[00:44:29.851 --> 00:44:31.912]  They love the old and the scared.
[00:44:32.273 --> 00:44:33.673]  Oh, that's what they prey on.
[00:44:33.953 --> 00:44:36.554]  When you brave and stand up to them, they won't fool with you.
[00:44:37.055 --> 00:44:39.956]  And Mr. Jones, we got to win this thing, and it's coming on us soon.
[00:44:41.095 --> 00:44:46.176]  And yesterday I gave six year tapes to six new cadets that got out to Academy Tuesday.
[00:44:47.616 --> 00:44:48.276]  Well, good job.
[00:44:48.316 --> 00:44:49.197]  What was their response?
[00:44:49.497 --> 00:44:51.317]  Well, I haven't talked to them yet.
[00:44:51.417 --> 00:44:52.937]  Our old sergeant, he's getting very tired.
[00:44:52.957 --> 00:44:54.598]  I said, Charlie, I got six new ones coming in.
[00:44:54.858 --> 00:44:55.818]  Can you give me some tapes?
[00:44:56.118 --> 00:45:00.779]  All I had was Beyond Treason and I think JFK.
[00:45:01.419 --> 00:45:04.520]  But I passed it out to them and I'm going to give them some more.
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:05.480]  I'm running them off today.
[00:45:06.345 --> 00:45:07.526]  But I want to thank you, sir.
[00:45:07.586 --> 00:45:09.248]  God, what would we do without you?
[00:45:09.268 --> 00:45:11.951]  I know you don't want no praise, but, man, I don't know where I would be.
[00:45:12.551 --> 00:45:16.315]  Sometimes when I think, when I look at it all, I feel like I'm with you, you know?
[00:45:16.335 --> 00:45:19.859]  I don't have nobody else, but, man, you stood up to these people.
[00:45:19.939 --> 00:45:25.565]  Man, my God, you're like the ones in prison, the touch hogs, they stand in front of the
[00:45:26.289 --> 00:45:28.250]  Well thank you Charles, I appreciate the call.
[00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:29.811]  Wow, you bring tears to my eyes.
[00:45:29.831 --> 00:45:32.173]  Listen, it's not hard to do when you realize
[00:45:55.738 --> 00:46:01.300]  Just, I keep saying it, the evil of these people, what they're doing to our country, they are a bunch of scum!
[00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:02.961]  We've got to fight them!
[00:46:03.001 --> 00:46:04.481]  We've got to stand up against them!
[00:46:05.822 --> 00:46:06.802]  They're totally wicked!
[00:46:07.302 --> 00:46:09.263]  Rodney in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:46:10.363 --> 00:46:11.284]  Alex, how are you?
[00:46:11.444 --> 00:46:11.844]  Pretty good.
[00:46:12.404 --> 00:46:15.025]  Alex, I want to say three things real quickly.
[00:46:15.065 --> 00:46:22.428]  First of all, I got my 9-1-1 road to tyranny, and martial law, and the third
[00:46:23.038 --> 00:46:31.685]  DVD was on internment camps and I had an opportunity to share that with my family and friends.
[00:46:32.766 --> 00:46:36.069]  And of course it had an effect on a few.
[00:46:37.791 --> 00:46:41.774]  Some of the others there right now, they don't know what to make of it.
[00:46:42.014 --> 00:46:46.238]  In fact, they don't even want to talk to me about it.
[00:46:46.298 --> 00:46:48.660]  But you know, at least I did my part.
[00:46:49.198 --> 00:46:51.600]  Like Charles and many others like yourself.
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:53.641]  And at least I got the truth to them.
[00:46:53.701 --> 00:46:59.246]  So if they don't want to accept it, God knows their blood is not on my hands.
[00:46:59.306 --> 00:47:03.709]  And I think you and others who are out there putting out the truth should have the same attitude.
[00:47:04.149 --> 00:47:04.930]  I pray for them.
[00:47:05.770 --> 00:47:11.074]  Now, your interview with Jerome yesterday was an excellent interview.
[00:47:11.134 --> 00:47:13.556]  And I really appreciate the way you approached him.
[00:47:14.317 --> 00:47:17.039]  You were able to establish a common ground.
[00:47:17.905 --> 00:47:46.068]  uh... with with the borders and whatever and and uh... try to concentrate on that but i also think that it was important uh... the way you asked him questions about his uh... being so obeisant to George Bush and some of these other neocons to expose him because uh... let's just face it uh... you know he's uh... trying to appease his future employers and i don't think it's going to do him a bit of good and my third and final point is
[00:47:47.281 --> 00:47:52.326]  You were earlier talking about the children being tortured with these shock belts.
[00:47:53.387 --> 00:48:05.738]  I, last month, read an article talking about the state of Florida, and you mentioned the Florida is one of the, probably is the worst state when it comes to children being in protective services.
[00:48:06.339 --> 00:48:11.784]  They said that four or five years after it was exposed that the state of Florida had
[00:48:13.089 --> 00:48:17.031]  Weren't able to account for many children and they're carrying 3,000 plus.
[00:48:17.311 --> 00:48:17.991]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:48:18.051 --> 00:48:20.052]  Now they say it's even worse.
[00:48:21.173 --> 00:48:23.534]  And the number they gave was like 750.
[00:48:24.034 --> 00:48:32.258]  But it's like you always say, any time the newspaper or the government put out figures, it's usually three to four or five times even worse than that.
[00:48:32.959 --> 00:48:36.080]  So Florida, they're still doing the same old thing.
[00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:38.141]  They're still up to this bag of tricks.
[00:48:38.621 --> 00:48:41.703]  And to tell you the truth, I asked myself the question.
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:49.101]  If they're not able to account for these three or four thousand kids that they have taken from parents, where are these kids?
[00:48:49.201 --> 00:48:49.962]  Have they killed them?
[00:48:50.622 --> 00:48:51.202]  A lot of them.
[00:48:51.602 --> 00:48:55.983]  That's why it got in the news three years ago, four years ago, because a bunch of them have been found dead.
[00:48:56.603 --> 00:49:00.204]  Now finally, Revelations chapter 21, verse 8.
[00:49:00.824 --> 00:49:11.046]  And this is for all of you out here who are melancholy and depressed and really are trying to make excuses for not standing up for yourselves.
[00:49:11.903 --> 00:49:13.905]  Even God says He hates cowards.
[00:49:14.285 --> 00:49:25.295]  And if anybody questions what I'm saying, you turn to that scripture, Revelation 21, verse 8, and one of the number one things that God said that He would destroy men for is being cowards.
[00:49:25.796 --> 00:49:30.640]  And we're living in a time and period where, hey, you know, we can't afford to be cowards.
[00:49:31.021 --> 00:49:33.923]  And if you're going to be a coward with this issue, hey, you know what?
[00:49:34.284 --> 00:49:35.605]  God is going to have to ask
[00:49:36.636 --> 00:49:38.797]  Your blood, and I'm not talking about you personally.
[00:49:38.837 --> 00:49:42.958]  Well, a man who isn't a coward only dies once, but a coward dies a thousand deaths.
[00:49:43.018 --> 00:49:45.398]  Yes, sir, and God says so.
[00:49:45.479 --> 00:49:50.480]  So, brother, please keep up the good work, and I really appreciate that interview yesterday.
[00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:51.240]  Thank you.
[00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:51.940]  Well, thank you.
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:50:01.503]  Yeah, I got him on over the border stuff, but I had to bring up... Kurt Neema wrote an article about it, and Kurt was like, it's a good article, but Kurt says in there, well, Alex then said, you know, my call was wild.
[00:50:01.743 --> 00:50:04.164]  No, Kurt, I brought you to the head of the line.
[00:50:04.184 --> 00:50:04.684]  You were actually
[00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:06.691]  Like the sixth caller in line.
[00:50:06.731 --> 00:50:08.731]  I brought you to the head and gave you a few minutes with the guy.
[00:50:09.272 --> 00:50:10.352]  And I was trying to grill him.
[00:50:11.793 --> 00:50:16.355]  So, you know, I wish I could have kept you on longer, but the main subject I was covering was the borders.
[00:50:18.035 --> 00:50:19.876]  Which is a very, very, very serious issue.
[00:50:19.896 --> 00:50:21.157]  We need to get Curt Nemo back on, though.
[00:50:21.177 --> 00:50:23.718]  I ought to get Curt Nemo on for 30 minutes just to talk about Corsi.
[00:50:24.178 --> 00:50:25.538]  In fact, I meant to do that last night.
[00:50:25.558 --> 00:50:28.059]  I meant to tell my producer to call Curt Nemo this morning.
[00:50:28.099 --> 00:50:30.380]  In fact, Curt, if you can get in, it's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:32.141]  You're welcome to say whatever you want about Corsi.
[00:50:35.419 --> 00:50:36.280]  All right.
[00:50:38.541 --> 00:50:43.003]  I said that I'd get into the butterfly effect, new species, hashes in lamb, London Guardian.
[00:50:43.023 --> 00:50:43.703]  This is really big.
[00:50:43.983 --> 00:50:45.064]  We'll cover this when we get back.
[00:50:45.684 --> 00:50:46.605]  Got another guest coming up.
[00:50:46.625 --> 00:50:49.106]  Daniel Esselstyn is scheduled for later.
[00:50:49.706 --> 00:50:50.867]  He was there at Bilderberg Rift this year.
[00:50:50.907 --> 00:50:52.948]  I was on Coast to Coast AM with him last night.
[00:50:53.368 --> 00:50:53.668]  Stay with us.
[00:50:53.688 --> 00:50:54.209]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:59.389 --> 00:51:07.657]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[00:51:07.837 --> 00:51:10.180]  We're expecting around a thousand people in attendance.
[00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:19.629]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[00:51:20.149 --> 00:51:23.672]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neo-Con Agenda.
[00:51:24.092 --> 00:51:44.930]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Charmplin, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:48.993]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[00:51:49.434 --> 00:51:50.716]  Arm yourself with the truth.
[00:51:51.036 --> 00:51:56.324]  Secure your tickets today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:51:59.605 --> 00:52:03.509]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:52:03.749 --> 00:52:09.174]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:52:09.454 --> 00:52:19.824]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:52:19.984 --> 00:52:24.328]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:52:24.508 --> 00:52:25.309]  We're good to go!
[00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:39.820]  I think so.
[00:53:01.019 --> 00:53:01.360]  I think so.
[00:53:16.221 --> 00:53:16.901]  We're good to go!
[00:53:45.777 --> 00:53:48.859]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:54.984]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:53:59.167 --> 00:53:59.728]  Randy Gideon,
[00:54:14.415 --> 00:54:16.896]  Derek, Russell, Michael, your calls are coming up.
[00:54:16.916 --> 00:54:19.778]  Let's have a London Guardian today.
[00:54:19.958 --> 00:54:20.778]  Butterfly effect.
[00:54:20.798 --> 00:54:22.299]  New species hatches in lab.
[00:54:22.319 --> 00:54:27.462]  The creation of a new species is something the scientific orthodoxy said should take thousands of years of genetic isolation.
[00:54:27.862 --> 00:54:29.603]  Has been achieved in a lab in just three months.
[00:54:30.023 --> 00:54:36.646]  Scientists think they have recreated the process that produced a stunning South American butterfly called Heliconus hepari...
[00:54:38.018 --> 00:54:38.618]  We're good to go.
[00:55:01.423 --> 00:55:14.526]  It says, biological dogma is that speculation that process by which a new species forms happens with two populations of the same species becoming separated for millennia by a new mountain range or a change in a river's course.
[00:55:14.566 --> 00:55:20.447]  For example, in their separate environments, the two diverge genetically and cannot mate when they reunite.
[00:55:20.467 --> 00:55:28.549]  The orthodoxy up to now is that it mostly has a destructive role, said George Turner, a professor of evolutionary biology at the University of Hull.
[00:55:29.415 --> 00:55:37.321]  That's how species sometimes come to an end when they collapse into each other after their unique adaptations are all mashed together.
[00:55:37.381 --> 00:55:55.596]  But Chris Jiggins of the University of Edinburgh and his colleagues were able to recreate butterflies with the same characteristics as H. hepapea after just three generations of breeding in a lab between two related species, H. mellifoma and H. syndeno.
[00:55:56.357 --> 00:55:59.318]  It was unique, surprisingly, how easy it was for Dr. Jiggins.
[00:55:59.758 --> 00:56:10.583]  This really implies that the process of speculation, or spectation, excuse me, could also have happened naturally, very quickly, he said.
[00:56:10.903 --> 00:56:15.465]  The process may explain the remarkably diversity among different species of butterflies.
[00:56:15.505 --> 00:56:17.806]  Research is reported in the Journal of Nature.
[00:56:19.707 --> 00:56:22.568]  And there's all sorts of weird genetic manipulations going on.
[00:56:24.354 --> 00:56:35.337]  Again, this is really nothing compared to, again, rhesus monkeys that glow in the dark you can buy on the streets of Hong Kong that are part jellyfish, or chimera spider goats in upstate New York or Wisconsin.
[00:56:35.837 --> 00:56:38.938]  And we've had the CEOs of these companies on, it's been in CBS News.
[00:56:38.998 --> 00:56:40.798]  This is really happening.
[00:56:41.958 --> 00:56:47.240]  But this is just simply genetically manipulating two species of butterfly and creating something new.
[00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:52.601]  I guess hybridization is the proper term here.
[00:56:53.559 --> 00:57:00.766]  But, you know, I think it's a false debate that's been created by the media, the attack by the Darwinists on creationism.
[00:57:01.727 --> 00:57:06.311]  Many of the top scientists in the world, in fact the majority, believe that everything shows the hand of a creator.
[00:57:06.911 --> 00:57:09.033]  And I don't argue with how God makes something.
[00:57:09.133 --> 00:57:09.654]  I don't know.
[00:57:09.674 --> 00:57:13.457]  There's a lot of different evidence on both sides, a lot of the
[00:57:15.143 --> 00:57:19.147]  People that, you know, say it's all evolution, a lot of their evidence is frauds.
[00:57:19.187 --> 00:57:23.190]  They've manufactured so many frauds, it just would take hours to cover them all.
[00:57:23.290 --> 00:57:24.451]  Fraud after fraud after fraud.
[00:57:24.952 --> 00:57:30.436]  And the more research the genetic engineers do into the genetic code, it shows clear design.
[00:57:31.237 --> 00:57:32.118]  It didn't just happen.
[00:57:32.138 --> 00:57:33.659]  I mean, imagine mud.
[00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:41.286]  Like they say, you know, three billion years ago, and just the chemicals mixed together, the elements, and then magically a bacteria forms.
[00:57:41.946 --> 00:57:42.687]  A bacteria
[00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:44.100]  I think?
[00:58:00.532 --> 00:58:04.574]  We've almost sold out the conference in LA, not this weekend, but next weekend, the 24th and 25th.
[00:58:04.774 --> 00:58:11.057]  You better get your tickets now at Infowars.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:11.297 --> 00:58:21.282]  If you want my film, Martial Law or Road to Tyranny, or the book I've written, the books I carry, the other videos I carry, go to the secure online video and bookstore at Infowars.com.
[00:58:21.842 --> 00:58:26.885]  You not only get great materials that ends up supporting this broadcast and other people that have written books and made films that I carry,
[00:58:27.875 --> 00:58:30.858]  But you also have great tools to get the word out to others.
[00:58:30.878 --> 00:58:35.762]  So go to the video and bookstore at Infowars.com and make some purchases to support us.
[00:58:35.782 --> 00:58:36.402]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:39.345 --> 00:58:43.248]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[00:58:43.568 --> 00:58:44.409]  Or call toll free 877-376-45.
[00:58:44.449 --> 00:58:44.749]  Big Brother.
[00:58:56.898 --> 00:58:57.979]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:58.680 --> 00:58:59.780]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:00.441 --> 00:59:01.261]  You want answers?
[00:59:02.002 --> 00:59:02.923]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:02.943 --> 00:59:07.326]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:07.766 --> 00:59:11.870]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:12.770 --> 00:59:17.394]  We are now into hour number two on this live 15th day of June 2006.
[00:59:23.547 --> 00:59:27.190]  Daniel Estillon has been covering the Bilderberg Group for 15 years.
[00:59:27.210 --> 00:59:28.991]  We've been interviewing him the last several years.
[00:59:29.011 --> 00:59:34.235]  I got a chance to meet him in person in Ottawa, the capital of Canada, last week.
[00:59:35.536 --> 00:59:39.379]  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, I interviewed him for a film we're going to be making.
[00:59:39.399 --> 00:59:40.500]  It'll be out in the next six months.
[00:59:41.761 --> 00:59:45.464]  He's written scholarly dissertations on the Bilderberg Group, has a lot of great sources inside.
[00:59:45.844 --> 00:59:47.826]  He has a best-selling book now being sold in 23 countries.
[00:59:50.290 --> 00:59:52.211]  He is a Canadian living in Spain.
[00:59:52.251 --> 00:59:54.332]  He is in Canada right now, still visiting family.
[00:59:54.713 --> 00:59:56.273]  And he joins us for the next 30 minutes.
[00:59:56.313 --> 01:00:00.856]  Then in 30 minutes, we will get to all the callers that are patiently holding when we let Mr. Estolán go.
[01:00:01.356 --> 01:00:03.458]  Daniel Estolán, great to have you on with us.
[01:00:03.558 --> 01:00:05.179]  Alex, thank you so much for having me back.
[01:00:05.219 --> 01:00:06.479]  It's always a pleasure to be on your show.
[01:00:06.699 --> 01:00:07.080]  You bet.
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:08.040]  It's always a pleasure to have you.
[01:00:08.921 --> 01:00:10.342]  Just a little thumbnail sketch.
[01:00:10.402 --> 01:00:15.905]  Was the coverage of 2006 on a scale of 1 to 100, what score would you give it?
[01:00:16.305 --> 01:00:16.785]  I think about 159.
[01:00:18.706 --> 01:00:19.626]  This has been tremendous.
[01:00:19.646 --> 01:00:23.388]  I have never seen anything like this in the 15 years I've been covering the deliver conferences.
[01:00:23.888 --> 01:00:31.130]  As a matter of fact, taken all together, there were more people at this year's conference, more media exposure than in the 14 previous years put together.
[01:00:31.210 --> 01:00:32.510]  So I'm very, very grateful.
[01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:39.292]  And I'm especially grateful to you, Alex, for actually coming out, because it's wonderful to know that I'm fighting on your side and you're fighting on ours.
[01:00:39.652 --> 01:00:41.853]  Because with guys like you, I think we can win this war.
[01:00:42.745 --> 01:00:45.066]  Absolutely, it was great meeting Tucker as well.
[01:00:46.647 --> 01:00:52.830]  Go through, just give us a preview, because this segment is about to end, a preview of what you want to cover in the next 30 minutes.
[01:00:53.570 --> 01:01:07.377]  Well, I think we can talk about some of the people who were at the conference, some of the things that they talked about, and give a little bit of a background again for the people who understand, for them to help them to understand what the Bilderbergers are, who they are, and what their future plans are.
[01:01:07.537 --> 01:01:10.818]  And you've got moles in Bilderberg, so does Tucker, I've even now got some
[01:01:12.967 --> 01:01:15.127]  You also said you've gotten some of their minutes this year.
[01:01:15.167 --> 01:01:15.928]  I want to go over that.
[01:01:16.508 --> 01:01:17.568]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:01:19.528 --> 01:01:25.189]  Over the next couple of days, I'll have a complete rundown of everything that these people have talked about, who said what to whom.
[01:01:25.769 --> 01:01:29.230]  And over the next couple of weeks, I'll be putting my annual bill report together.
[01:01:29.450 --> 01:01:30.650]  Let me just bring this up now.
[01:01:31.831 --> 01:01:39.092]  We heard while we were there, you know, that diplomatic armored limousine pulled into the underground parking garage, the only car to do that.
[01:01:39.747 --> 01:01:43.429]  We know Pataki was there, a big presidential candidate coming up, speculative.
[01:01:44.129 --> 01:01:48.551]  We're getting the report that Hillary made the short hour flight, and that Hillary Clinton was there.
[01:01:48.971 --> 01:01:50.612]  I've gotten that from three separate sources.
[01:01:50.652 --> 01:01:51.373]  What's your take on it?
[01:01:51.913 --> 01:01:55.254]  Well, I was very surprised when you said that last night on Coast to Coast.
[01:01:56.235 --> 01:01:59.977]  I wasn't aware of her presence at the conference, and of course I haven't seen any photographs.
[01:01:59.997 --> 01:02:03.638]  So I will be meeting tomorrow one of my people in Ottawa.
[01:02:03.718 --> 01:02:05.919]  I'm going to make a special trip to Ottawa to see this guy.
[01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:09.141]  He has quite a few photographs from the conference.
[01:02:09.734 --> 01:02:16.367]  And we'll just go meticulously through all the stuff he has, just to make sure, if you're right, this will be quite a piece of news.
[01:02:17.938 --> 01:02:21.680]  Well, you know, I got it from Scott first, who stayed the night there.
[01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:23.621]  He got the letter where they ordered him that he had to be out at 8.30.
[01:02:23.821 --> 01:02:24.661]  That's right.
[01:02:25.081 --> 01:02:28.843]  He then called them and talked to the head guy, and he's given me good info.
[01:02:29.323 --> 01:02:34.185]  And supposedly the head of the hotel just said, well, man, we couldn't... he was trying to get a refund because they kicked him out.
[01:02:34.205 --> 01:02:39.407]  And they said, we couldn't unless we had important people like Hillary and David Rockefeller and the Queen here, Queen Beatrix.
[01:02:39.587 --> 01:02:45.750]  And then I made some other phone calls after I heard that and got the same info from two separate people.
[01:02:45.810 --> 01:02:47.531]  So we'll find out.
[01:02:48.189 --> 01:02:54.173]  Well, if Hillary Clinton indeed was there, even for the New York Times and the Washington Post, they'll have a very difficult time keeping a lid on it.
[01:02:55.494 --> 01:02:57.776]  And then Otto was, what, only about an hour flight from New York?
[01:02:58.757 --> 01:03:00.678]  Otto was about an hour flight, exactly, an hour and a quarter.
[01:03:01.819 --> 01:03:03.520]  So, we'll find out.
[01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:08.403]  I mean, who do you think was in that big car that had the diplomatic U.S.
[01:03:08.463 --> 01:03:10.004]  plates and went in the underground garage?
[01:03:10.865 --> 01:03:12.146]  Um, I don't know.
[01:03:12.366 --> 01:03:13.407]  I really don't know.
[01:03:13.467 --> 01:03:14.187]  It might have been Harper.
[01:03:16.389 --> 01:03:18.931]  I would not put it past the Canadian Secret Service.
[01:03:18.971 --> 01:03:20.251]  As a matter of fact, they've done it before.
[01:03:22.433 --> 01:03:28.016]  Hiding an important dignitary using another country's diplomatic license plate, another country's vehicle.
[01:03:28.096 --> 01:03:29.416]  So, I really don't know.
[01:03:30.057 --> 01:03:34.499]  I still have not been able to confirm whether Harper, Canadian Prime Minister, was at the Bill of Rights Conference.
[01:03:35.099 --> 01:03:38.381]  And again, if Hillary Clinton was there, it would be something else.
[01:03:39.844 --> 01:03:47.592]  We'll be right back after this quick break with Daniel Estolano to go through the photos he got, the sources he has, he's learned some of what was on the agenda inside.
[01:03:48.112 --> 01:03:48.573]  Stay with us.
[01:03:51.317 --> 01:03:59.585]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[01:03:59.765 --> 01:04:02.108]  We're expecting around a thousand people in attendance.
[01:04:02.708 --> 01:04:11.557]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[01:04:12.077 --> 01:04:15.599]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda.
[01:04:16.039 --> 01:04:36.831]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Charnley, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[01:04:37.151 --> 01:04:40.893]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[01:04:41.013 --> 01:04:41.193]  Yes.
[01:04:41.353 --> 01:04:42.594]  Arm yourself with the truth.
[01:04:42.954 --> 01:04:48.237]  Secure your tickets today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:04:52.662 --> 01:04:57.165]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:04:57.505 --> 01:05:01.607]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:05:01.887 --> 01:05:02.448]  We listened.
[01:05:02.748 --> 01:05:07.731]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:05:08.011 --> 01:05:08.491]  We listened.
[01:05:08.872 --> 01:05:11.913]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:05:12.334 --> 01:05:12.854]  We listened.
[01:05:13.334 --> 01:05:17.397]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:05:17.777 --> 01:05:18.258]  We listened.
[01:05:18.598 --> 01:05:23.842]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:05:24.262 --> 01:05:25.623]  Again, we listened.
[01:05:25.983 --> 01:05:33.369]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:05:33.749 --> 01:05:37.212]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling
[01:05:43.225 --> 01:05:44.209]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[01:05:44.229 --> 01:05:45.874]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:51.221 --> 01:05:58.506]  United States Pharmacopeia, USP, sets the standard for most food supplements and are used in over 95% of all vitamin and mineral supplements in the world.
[01:05:58.686 --> 01:06:01.729]  The problem is that these products have never appeared in any living tissue.
[01:06:01.849 --> 01:06:05.211]  They're created in laboratories and are not recognizable to the body's metabolism.
[01:06:05.631 --> 01:06:14.598]  Grown by Nature products are different because they use re-natured ingredients, proprietary blends of essential vitamins and minerals, with co-factors of proteins, lipids, and complex carbohydrates.
[01:06:14.958 --> 01:06:21.302]  Over 50 studies have been conducted on re-natured nutrients and over 20 have been published in peer-reviewed journals proclaiming their superiority.
[01:06:21.663 --> 01:06:26.186]  As a result, Grown by Nature vitamins and supplements are now recognized as simply the best available!
[01:06:26.566 --> 01:06:28.127]  Call 877-817-9829.
[01:06:28.547 --> 01:06:33.751]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your Grown by Nature products today!
[01:06:34.231 --> 01:06:38.014]  We are what we eat, and since we are of nature, we should eat foods in their natural form.
[01:06:38.374 --> 01:06:41.336]  Only Grown by Nature offers a full line of re-natured nutrients.
[01:06:41.696 --> 01:06:43.197]  Call 877-817-9829.
[01:06:43.217 --> 01:06:49.462]  That's 877-817-9829 because not all products are grown by nature, but they should be.
[01:06:51.424 --> 01:06:57.068]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:59.730 --> 01:07:05.895]  Eight minutes, ten seconds into this second hour, Daniel Hustleman, award-winning journalist, best-selling author.
[01:07:07.862 --> 01:07:10.463]  Published in 23 countries with his book on the Bilderberg Group.
[01:07:10.543 --> 01:07:15.805]  He was there in Ottawa in the capital city of Canada with myself and Jim Tucker and others.
[01:07:16.605 --> 01:07:23.968]  And Daniel, let's run through who was attending, what the main issues were on the agenda, the photographs you were able to get.
[01:07:23.988 --> 01:07:30.391]  And then I want to talk about this historic, why you think it got blown wide open all over CTV, all over
[01:07:31.363 --> 01:07:32.544]  Canadian television.
[01:07:32.884 --> 01:07:33.725]  You were all over TV.
[01:07:33.765 --> 01:07:34.306]  Tucker was.
[01:07:34.346 --> 01:07:35.267]  They talked about my case.
[01:07:35.307 --> 01:07:36.508]  It was on the front page of the papers.
[01:07:36.928 --> 01:07:37.969]  Why it broke so big?
[01:07:37.989 --> 01:07:41.812]  In fact, let's tackle that first and then get into who was there and what was on the agenda.
[01:07:42.053 --> 01:07:47.377]  Why do you think, as you said earlier, I said on a scale of 1 to 100, how good of reporters do we have this year?
[01:07:47.397 --> 01:07:48.158]  And you said over 100.
[01:07:48.198 --> 01:07:50.440]  You said it was 159%.
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:54.123]  Why do you think it's getting bigger and bigger each year?
[01:07:54.724 --> 01:07:58.407]  Well, for the same reason that these people came out in your support and your help.
[01:07:58.874 --> 01:08:10.517]  And they got you out of Canadian prison, basically had it not been for the Canadian press, for the people of the Audible Citizen and the CBC, you would have been sent back home and we would not have had the pleasure of having you at the Billing Conference.
[01:08:11.017 --> 01:08:17.639]  Canadian press is very different from the United States mainstream press and from the European press, especially the French-Canadian press.
[01:08:17.679 --> 01:08:25.581]  They're very feisty, fired up, they love freedom, they are pro-independence, and they will not stand in the way of people
[01:08:29.003 --> 01:08:31.064]  Taking the right of expression away from them.
[01:08:31.104 --> 01:08:37.526]  It's one of the reasons you have so many people from from French Canada covering the Biliber conference, especially television crews.
[01:08:38.727 --> 01:08:54.413]  So again, very very grateful and what I don't understand and haven't been able to understand for a long time is why did the Biliber decide to hold this year's conference in Canada knowing full well and remembering what happened to them in 1996 when we exposed their plan for breakup of Canada and
[01:08:55.311 --> 01:09:00.054]  And, uh, eventual merger of English-speaking Canada and the United States into Greater North America.
[01:09:00.074 --> 01:09:02.455]  At that time, a call for help went out.
[01:09:02.555 --> 01:09:05.837]  My desperate call for help went out, too, to the entire country.
[01:09:06.017 --> 01:09:14.422]  And, uh, over half a million people came out all over the country supporting the cause and saying no to the Greater North America, and the Bilderbergers have to retract their steps in their statements.
[01:09:15.062 --> 01:09:22.366]  Obviously, they have not learned, and I think this will be the last time Canada will hold, at least, uh, having it so close to the French-Canadian border.
[01:09:23.021 --> 01:09:24.583]  And so I think that's one of the reasons.
[01:09:24.663 --> 01:09:37.494]  As far as the actual participants are concerned, for me, as I said to you a couple of days ago, this has been the strongest Bill Liber conference in the last decade.
[01:09:37.514 --> 01:09:43.600]  You've had numerous former Prime Ministers and Presidents of countries such as, for example, Carl Bildt.
[01:09:44.210 --> 01:09:52.457]  The former Prime Minister of Sweden, Francisco Pinto Basavão, basically the man who runs Portugal as former Prime Minister, was there.
[01:09:52.477 --> 01:09:59.383]  You had very affluent leaders from European nations, from France, from Germany, from Great Britain.
[01:09:59.583 --> 01:10:11.933]  The Federal Reserve President, not the Chairman, the Federal Reserve President, the former Federal Reserve Chairman, Volcker, we had Chalabi, David Rockefeller, Kissinger, please continue.
[01:10:14.301 --> 01:10:15.201]  Uh-huh.
[01:10:15.441 --> 01:10:16.982]  Daniel, I was just listing some more.
[01:10:17.002 --> 01:10:17.562]  Please continue.
[01:10:18.262 --> 01:10:20.343]  Well, again, just looking through the list.
[01:10:20.463 --> 01:10:26.344]  Also, you had an unprecedented number of publishers and editors of newspapers in all.
[01:10:26.384 --> 01:10:28.865]  There were 14 people, which is unheard of.
[01:10:28.925 --> 01:10:32.106]  I think the most in the last decade we've had was something like 8 or 9.
[01:10:32.446 --> 01:10:36.347]  So, this is almost a 100% or 70% increase.
[01:10:36.367 --> 01:10:38.528]  You had the editor from Le Figaro.
[01:10:38.548 --> 01:10:39.688]  You had people from
[01:10:40.461 --> 01:10:42.362]  The Global Mail, Canada's leading newspaper.
[01:10:42.402 --> 01:10:44.582]  You have the people, of course, from the Washington Post and the New York Times.
[01:10:45.883 --> 01:10:48.263]  The two guys from The Economist being rapporteurs.
[01:10:48.783 --> 01:10:51.244]  Anyway, tremendous turnout.
[01:10:51.304 --> 01:10:57.166]  And, of course, you have people like Richard Holbrooke, Alan Hubbard, who was the assistant to President Bush for economic policy.
[01:10:57.226 --> 01:10:58.146]  He is a regular.
[01:10:58.186 --> 01:11:00.907]  Vernon Jordan, Bill Clinton's dear friend.
[01:11:00.947 --> 01:11:05.048]  You had a guy from the Times of London, Anatoly Kalitsky.
[01:11:06.428 --> 01:11:08.249]  People from Royal Dutch Shell, from BP.
[01:11:09.743 --> 01:11:22.455]  From the Research Institute of Finland, manned by the name of Sixten Korman, which is interlocked with the Royal Institute for International Affairs and the CFR in the United States.
[01:11:22.695 --> 01:11:27.940]  Anyway, very, very strong confab of leaders.
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:35.807]  People like Henry Kravis, for example, of KKR, Marie-José Kravis from the Hudson Institute, European commissioners, people from NATO.
[01:11:38.815 --> 01:11:40.435]  Also, Governor Pataki was there.
[01:11:41.275 --> 01:11:41.856]  Pataki was there?
[01:11:41.876 --> 01:11:42.496]  I'm not exactly sure.
[01:11:42.536 --> 01:11:46.536]  I haven't been able to get it down exactly what his role was in the whole thing, but we'll find out.
[01:11:46.576 --> 01:12:08.080]  What was interesting is, the day after the conference ended, there was an article in the Toronto Star, I'm not sure if, I'm just getting it now, if you had a chance to see it, Ontario Premier, who would be like the governor of an American state, by the name of Dalton McKinley, suddenly came out in favor of the nuclear reactors being built,
[01:12:09.431 --> 01:12:19.536]  And the front page of the Toronto Star has this big article saying Ontario to build nuclear reactors and that was the actual conference that he gave the speech, the stump speech, he gave at the Bilderberg conference.
[01:12:19.956 --> 01:12:22.457]  So the following day after that, things began to happen.
[01:12:24.158 --> 01:12:24.738]  Absolutely.
[01:12:24.798 --> 01:12:28.320]  What are your sources inside Bilderberg, the group saying the main agenda was?
[01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:30.601]  Well, let's take it one at a time.
[01:12:32.262 --> 01:12:36.364]  I've been able to check it with Jim Tucker and my sources are basically confirming the same thing.
[01:12:37.173 --> 01:12:43.356]  That the Bilderbergers are very, very worried about the... I'm sorry, I've been doing so many interviews, I think I'm losing my voice.
[01:12:43.716 --> 01:12:52.480]  That the Bilderbergers are very, very worried about Latin America using oil as a trump card to block the expansion of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
[01:12:53.060 --> 01:13:03.725]  And they are worried that the left-leaning governments of Latin America, led by people like Chavez, will use the trump card of petroleum to manipulate the prices.
[01:13:04.730 --> 01:13:05.190]  I don't know.
[01:13:31.053 --> 01:13:32.594]  And so the billboards are very, very worried.
[01:13:32.614 --> 01:13:41.720]  It'll be interesting to see what Jim comes up with over the next couple of days with additional information as far as the discussion points and talking points over the challenge.
[01:13:41.740 --> 01:13:42.861]  What about Iran?
[01:13:43.541 --> 01:13:48.364]  We had a big split forming four years ago, about a year before the invasion of Iraq.
[01:13:48.684 --> 01:13:52.527]  You were telling me and Jim was saying there's an even bigger split now forming on Iran?
[01:13:53.267 --> 01:13:53.848]  Well, exactly.
[01:13:53.868 --> 01:13:56.449]  As a matter of fact, I just got this yesterday.
[01:14:00.041 --> 01:14:09.084]  Pearl, Richard Pearl, led one of the discussion forums on Iraq and he was talking about the need to find new strategies for Iraq, now that the Zarqawi is dead.
[01:14:09.164 --> 01:14:28.350]  And then one of the French representatives, I don't have the name because the Bilderberg Minutes never release the names of people, but one of the French representatives raised his hand and categorically stated that, I'm just reading off my notes, that the United States does not have a new strategy in Iraq.
[01:14:28.795 --> 01:14:47.611]  And to sell the old strategy, and again this is quote-unquote, and to sell the old strategy as new strategy is to, I can't read what I have here, is to take for idiots the members of the deliver conference.
[01:14:47.731 --> 01:14:55.398]  Meaning, again, that these people are very much against the war in Iraq, they're very much against the war in Iran, and from what I understand,
[01:14:56.044 --> 01:15:09.593]  The European Bilderberg Delegation has, pretty much using strong arm tactics, has been able to win over most of the American delegates in getting the Americans to back off their Iran war plans.
[01:15:11.414 --> 01:15:17.918]  But that could all evaporate very quickly if the Anglo-American power arm carries out a false flag attack.
[01:15:18.459 --> 01:15:22.902]  Well, that's true, but then again, there was a warning from a German delegate who said that
[01:15:24.303 --> 01:15:27.004]  It's very easy to start wars, but it's very difficult to finish them.
[01:15:27.224 --> 01:15:43.409]  And when Richard Prowl protested, this man said that the future developments in the Iraq War depend on the resistance and not on the American government, which basically goes to show you how little faith the European Bilderbergers have in the U.S.
[01:15:43.429 --> 01:15:44.549]  capacity to win the war.
[01:15:45.890 --> 01:15:53.352]  So now we've seen the split that formed in the 2002 meeting, caving in to the neocon arm losing control.
[01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:58.022]  Well, I think it's a bit ambitious to read it this way.
[01:15:58.042 --> 01:16:00.343]  I mean, I'd like to do the same thing, but I think it's just a bit ambitious.
[01:16:00.383 --> 01:16:03.844]  I think these people, their plans haven't changed.
[01:16:04.004 --> 01:16:07.366]  One world order, one world government, one currency, one religion, and so forth.
[01:16:07.486 --> 01:16:09.687]  They just think the neocons are moving too fast?
[01:16:09.767 --> 01:16:20.731]  Well, I think the neocons have basically had their useless and unnecessary diversions, which have taken the Bill of Burger main interests and main energies away from the key areas of
[01:16:22.717 --> 01:16:32.100]  Creating this world war government towards unnecessary diversions such as the war in Iraq and the war in Iran, which is I think one of the key reasons why they're not getting along as well now as they were.
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:35.421]  What are some of the other things that were discussed?
[01:16:36.581 --> 01:16:42.883]  Well, energy is always number one on the agenda and this year was the most important topic.
[01:16:42.943 --> 01:16:51.105]  Again, last year as I reported, I think it was an exclusive on your show, Alex, that shortly after the deliver conference they were talking about the increasing oil prices too.
[01:16:52.067 --> 01:16:53.328]  $150-$200 a barrel.
[01:16:53.748 --> 01:16:58.590]  At the time on oil, last May, I checked it a couple of days ago, it was $39-$40 a barrel.
[01:16:59.231 --> 01:17:00.571]  Since last year, it has doubled.
[01:17:00.591 --> 01:17:03.733]  If it doubles again, then we're going to have our $150 a barrel number.
[01:17:05.274 --> 01:17:07.255]  They're very concerned about energy resources.
[01:17:08.155 --> 01:17:18.540]  There was a lot of talk about alternative energy supplies, and there was also a lot of talk of seeing how the inevitable can be postponed, which brings me to the next point.
[01:17:19.199 --> 01:17:24.126]  Is that the housing market, which was the next point on the conversation, is about to explode.
[01:17:24.226 --> 01:17:33.438]  And again, over the last couple of days, especially yesterday, every newspaper in Canada has carried the headline on the front pages of all Canadian newspapers.
[01:17:34.019 --> 01:17:39.984]  That the stock markets are going down, not only in Canada, but in the entire world.
[01:17:40.124 --> 01:17:40.905]  Well, here's another one.
[01:17:40.985 --> 01:17:41.225]  U.S.
[01:17:41.285 --> 01:17:42.747]  News and World Report today.
[01:17:42.807 --> 01:17:44.909]  Housing bubble correction could be severe.
[01:17:45.469 --> 01:17:48.752]  Contrary to popular belief, the housing market hasn't cooled off that much.
[01:17:48.792 --> 01:17:55.278]  In fact, residential real estate prices continue to soar in a number of key metropolitan areas, according to a new study released this week.
[01:17:56.319 --> 01:17:57.379]  That's a good thing, right?
[01:17:57.480 --> 01:17:58.861]  Actually, no, because the fourth
[01:17:59.717 --> 01:18:07.683]  The froth building and housing prices raises the distinct possibility of significant corrections to come in many of those regions, and they go on to say we could see an implosion.
[01:18:08.183 --> 01:18:10.165]  Well, the liberals are very, very concerned about that.
[01:18:10.205 --> 01:18:12.446]  Again, these people, it's not that they're concerned for our well-being.
[01:18:12.466 --> 01:18:13.907]  I think all your audience understand that.
[01:18:14.268 --> 01:18:25.616]  What they are concerned about is if the housing market explodes or implodes, people are going to be left homeless and penniless, and then when you have a lot of dissatisfied individuals who are not able to put food on their table, then you're going to have all these people
[01:18:26.601 --> 01:18:31.663]  Well, the average American now is double mortgaged and just keeps living off of the equity in their home.
[01:18:31.683 --> 01:18:35.005]  And when that bubble pops, we're talking about total disintegration.
[01:18:35.445 --> 01:18:36.225]  One last number, Alex.
[01:18:36.245 --> 01:18:45.770]  It just came out this morning in El Mundo, which is Spain's leading newspaper, that the Spanish family is now paying 110% of its savings, of its value, towards the mortgage.
[01:18:45.790 --> 01:18:45.770]  110%.
[01:18:47.190 --> 01:18:47.971]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:48.191 --> 01:18:48.631]  Stay with us.
[01:18:51.812 --> 01:18:54.114]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:54.635 --> 01:18:57.458]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[01:18:58.398 --> 01:19:08.068]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it is possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:08.989 --> 01:19:14.174]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMedInc's patented methodology.

[01:19:26.385 --> 01:19:28.886]  Star War technology at its best.

[01:21:51.545 --> 01:21:57.529]  I used to be ashamed of my toenails, so I thought I was destined to wear tennis shoes through the heat of the summer and hide my toes at the beach.
[01:21:57.949 --> 01:22:00.611]  And then my podiatrist told me about Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:22:00.771 --> 01:22:05.394]  It tackles unsightly nails by clearing out the cause of the problem, yellowing keratin debris buildup.
[01:22:05.554 --> 01:22:10.358]  With regular use, Non-X Gel breaks down and removes the debris, so toenails look clear.
[01:22:10.558 --> 01:22:15.281]  This summer, I'm wearing open-toed sandals again, thanks to a topical natural gel called Non-X.
[01:22:15.501 --> 01:22:18.183]  If your toenails are embarrassing, I recommend Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:22:18.403 --> 01:22:21.305]  It's at your pharmacy or mass retailer in the foot care section.
[01:22:22.585 --> 01:22:23.586]  Looking for profits?
[01:22:23.666 --> 01:22:25.046]  Looking for safety and security?
[01:22:25.387 --> 01:22:28.588]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[01:22:28.648 --> 01:22:36.211]  This low mintage collector coin with a total series mintage under $600,000 has sold at four times its current price.
[01:22:36.271 --> 01:22:39.832]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[01:22:40.032 --> 01:22:41.533]  Secure your position today.
[01:22:41.593 --> 01:22:43.053]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:43.113 --> 01:22:43.353]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:51.365 --> 01:22:56.988]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:06.953 --> 01:23:07.593]  Welcome back.
[01:23:07.713 --> 01:23:09.254]  Final segment with Daniel Estillan.
[01:23:09.274 --> 01:23:11.075]  I know we have loaded phone lines.
[01:23:11.095 --> 01:23:14.797]  We'll go to your calls and cover more of the news after this next break.
[01:23:15.914 --> 01:23:17.775]  Dan, we've got about five minutes left together.
[01:23:17.795 --> 01:23:19.236]  It was, again, great meeting with you there.
[01:23:19.476 --> 01:23:22.278]  Great being on Coast to Coast with you last night.
[01:23:24.019 --> 01:23:31.984]  Other facets in the time we've got left, other things we need to know about the Bilderberg Group, you and Jim and others that have insiders are saying they're getting more and more concerned.
[01:23:32.004 --> 01:23:33.225]  There's a sense of urgency.
[01:23:33.265 --> 01:23:33.826]  Why is that?
[01:23:34.526 --> 01:23:40.370]  Well, for example, during this last commercial break, I had a chance to just to surf a little bit of the internet.
[01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:43.692]  I found an article from the Iranian newspaper called Tehran Times.
[01:23:45.737 --> 01:23:47.858]  And they're also reporting on the Bill and Margaret Conference.
[01:23:48.258 --> 01:23:52.439]  So again, they're not the first Asian newspaper.
[01:23:52.459 --> 01:23:54.420]  The Al Jazeera has been doing it for a long time.
[01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:57.981]  The Asian Time out of Hong Kong has been doing it as well.
[01:23:58.001 --> 01:24:04.162]  So there's a lot of coverage, and this is one of the things you were talking about last night, that these people are not too pleased about.
[01:24:04.262 --> 01:24:07.923]  Over the last five years, there's been a tremendous amount of press all over the world.
[01:24:08.944 --> 01:24:13.165]  Europe has always been there, once in a while, covering the conference, the United States and Canada.
[01:24:13.632 --> 01:24:16.253]  But now South American newspapers and magazines are picking it up.
[01:24:16.293 --> 01:24:21.154]  I got a call from a Turkish publisher who wants to do an interview for one of the leading magazines.
[01:24:21.554 --> 01:24:22.694]  Now the Iranians are doing it.
[01:24:22.734 --> 01:24:30.216]  The same thing, you know, you can say for the Qataris and the Kuwaitis and the Turkish publishers and the Japanese are doing it as well.
[01:24:30.536 --> 01:24:37.238]  So the Billenbergs are concerned because, again, what they do not want in any way is the light of truth to be shown on their evil task and evil deeds.
[01:24:38.869 --> 01:24:40.090]  And now it's in big U.S.
[01:24:40.150 --> 01:24:43.811]  newspapers and on Lou Dobbs that we're actually going into an American Union!
[01:24:44.712 --> 01:24:47.973]  They have to operate in secrecy and they're not getting that secrecy out!
[01:24:48.874 --> 01:25:05.602]  Well, Lou Dobbs is of course part of the establishment, so I'm not exactly sure what his plans are and why they have the news item other than the Bill of Rights and the North America Free Trade and the North American Union and the Lou Dobbs Show.
[01:25:06.181 --> 01:25:07.462]  But you're absolutely right.
[01:25:07.762 --> 01:25:12.065]  May I just bring one more point from the actual discussions at the Bilderberg Conference?
[01:25:13.507 --> 01:25:13.727]  Yes!
[01:25:14.667 --> 01:25:20.372]  One of the things we were talking about is, and this is a very important point, is the EU-Asia conflict, Russia, China, and the United States.
[01:25:20.992 --> 01:25:35.403]  And the European Bilderbergers, again, it's tremendous that there's such a difference of opinion between the Americans and the Europeans in the sense that to the Europeans, the United States is being outflanked in its now obvious strategy of controlling major oil and energy sources.
[01:25:35.979 --> 01:25:39.781]  In the Persian Gulf, the Central Asia, Caspian Bases, Africa, and beyond.
[01:25:40.462 --> 01:25:52.948]  And the European Bilderbergers glumly reported that if this trend of recent events continues, it won't be Bush-style democracy that is spreading, but rather Russian and Chinese influence over major oil and gas energy supplies.
[01:25:53.008 --> 01:26:04.575]  And one of the European Bilderbergers, during one of the coffee breaks or cocktail breaks, privately noted to another Bilderberger, this might be the worst United States strategic defeat over the last 50 years.
[01:26:06.801 --> 01:26:09.082]  But look at how the globalists have been selling out U.S.
[01:26:09.183 --> 01:26:10.183]  interests systematically.
[01:26:10.203 --> 01:26:12.765]  I think we're being sacrificed as part of a larger program.
[01:26:12.785 --> 01:26:17.267]  Daniel?
[01:26:17.608 --> 01:26:17.808]  Yes.
[01:26:19.469 --> 01:26:23.031]  I don't know.
[01:26:23.511 --> 01:26:30.776]  I think oil and energy being the primary item on the agenda, both the European and the American Bilderbergers basically are playing the same game.
[01:26:31.276 --> 01:26:34.718]  And what the Europeans are not too pleased about is that the United States going into these
[01:26:35.245 --> 01:27:00.412]  into the war in Iraq and now trying to, you know, the usual saber-rattling towards Iran may keep them away from a greater task of finding a way to control the world's energy supplies and what they're basically finding out is that the Americans and the Europeans do not believe or Europeans do not believe that the American way of attacking Iraq and now threatening Iran to get their hands on the last remaining oil and natural gas
[01:27:03.566 --> 01:27:05.848]  Well, I think the bottom line at the end of the day is this.
[01:27:06.549 --> 01:27:08.370]  They've been around since before 54.
[01:27:08.471 --> 01:27:16.938]  They were identified by some media in 54 by the hotel they met at, the Bilderberg, and so now they have tried to keep everything they're doing secret.
[01:27:17.399 --> 01:27:18.299]  That's been blown.
[01:27:18.359 --> 01:27:19.921]  Many of their programs are in trouble.
[01:27:19.941 --> 01:27:23.164]  They still have immense power, but it shows that they are not
[01:27:23.744 --> 01:27:30.928]  That they are not invincible, and the American people and others were taught that there are no elites, there's no corruption in government, there's no shadow government.
[01:27:31.308 --> 01:27:37.911]  Now the average person in the Western world and worldwide now knows there is a shadow government, and I think that's a big part of the battle, Daniel.
[01:27:38.652 --> 01:27:39.432]  I absolutely agree.
[01:27:39.472 --> 01:27:44.015]  I think it's very, very important, which is why, again, I'm very grateful for everything that you have been doing.
[01:27:44.035 --> 01:27:52.659]  And again, as I said last night on Coast to Coast, one of the things that people have always known and always said to me, and I'm sure they say the same thing to you, we always know that they lie to us, the government,
[01:27:53.044 --> 01:27:53.584]  We're good to go.
[01:28:23.463 --> 01:28:26.925]  And it's out in 28 countries, not 23.
[01:28:27.506 --> 01:28:29.347]  And we're very close to getting a U.S.
[01:28:29.387 --> 01:28:29.968]  publishing deal.
[01:28:30.028 --> 01:28:31.449]  Hopefully it will be out by December.
[01:28:31.649 --> 01:28:31.989]  All right.
[01:28:32.029 --> 01:28:34.991]  We've got links over to you and some of the articles you've written as well.
[01:28:35.031 --> 01:28:36.152]  Daniel, great having you on.
[01:28:36.472 --> 01:28:37.973]  Thank you so much, Alex, for having me on your show.
[01:28:38.093 --> 01:28:38.433]  God bless.
[01:28:38.453 --> 01:28:38.974]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:41.795 --> 01:28:42.676]  We're on the march.
[01:28:43.176 --> 01:28:44.797]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:45.718 --> 01:28:48.380]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:52.085 --> 01:28:54.427]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:28:54.667 --> 01:28:56.709]  When was the last time you used pure soap?

[01:29:53.471 --> 01:29:57.593]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:29:57.713 --> 01:30:00.595]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:00.675 --> 01:30:07.358]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:07.558 --> 01:30:10.562]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:10.782 --> 01:30:13.165]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:13.305 --> 01:30:23.458]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as affazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[01:30:23.638 --> 01:30:32.784]  MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.

[01:32:12.037 --> 01:32:13.138]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:32:13.879 --> 01:32:15.300]  Let's continue with Open Phones now.
[01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:17.321]  A great interview with Daniel Estalon on the Bilderberg Group.
[01:32:18.602 --> 01:32:20.604]  Let's speak to Randy in Virginia.
[01:32:20.664 --> 01:32:22.825]  Randy, thanks for holding your on the air worldwide.
[01:32:24.066 --> 01:32:25.087]  Alex, I got two points.
[01:32:25.147 --> 01:32:28.189]  Maybe we could go through this first one real quick so we can get to the second one.
[01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:35.434]  I haven't heard you talk a lot in the past about Columbine, the shooting, and I was just doing a quick reading
[01:32:36.528 --> 01:32:43.312]  On it over the last few days and what is the deal here with this guy that was the lead investigator for the FBI.
[01:32:43.352 --> 01:32:45.554]  He was a psychologist named Dwayne Fusilier.
[01:32:46.394 --> 01:32:52.178]  Turns out his son had made a tape two years earlier showing similar style attacks.
[01:32:53.439 --> 01:32:53.999]  A videotape.
[01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:59.623]  Sir, the founder of the Trenchcoat Mafia two years before was an FBI agent.
[01:32:59.843 --> 01:33:02.445]  The children, the young people were special trustees.
[01:33:03.897 --> 01:33:06.158]  The students reported four people inside shooting.
[01:33:06.178 --> 01:33:11.920]  There was over 120 bombs, 124 that didn't detonate.
[01:33:12.821 --> 01:33:15.582]  The SWAT team stayed outside for 4 hours 15 minutes.
[01:33:15.642 --> 01:33:16.662]  It was all staged.
[01:33:16.682 --> 01:33:17.583]  It was an inside job.
[01:33:17.603 --> 01:33:21.844]  So that was just your normal inside job like the Oklahoma City way?
[01:33:22.184 --> 01:33:24.145]  Total inside job, no debating it.
[01:33:24.665 --> 01:33:26.906]  If you look at the evidence, it's overwhelming.
[01:33:27.527 --> 01:33:29.847]  Okay, quick let me get to the second point.
[01:33:30.088 --> 01:33:33.549]  I saw a videotape about 10 years ago or
[01:33:34.096 --> 01:33:34.876]  However many years ago.
[01:33:35.056 --> 01:33:53.161]  Later, there was a revival, so-called, in Littleton with, you know, some of these charismatic churches with these kind of weird manifestations and things like that, which brings me to the point, you know, a connection possibly between the CIA-type mind control, mass mind control, and religion.
[01:33:53.961 --> 01:33:55.082]  And I'd like to give you an example.
[01:33:55.202 --> 01:33:59.843]  There's a guy who was held by some to be a prophet, you know, a modern prophet.
[01:33:59.883 --> 01:34:00.803]  His name is Rick Joyner.
[01:34:01.223 --> 01:34:03.344]  I used to drive a couple hours to visit his church
[01:34:03.803 --> 01:34:07.024]  He had a young guy under him who was supposedly, quote, ex-CIA.
[01:34:07.764 --> 01:34:13.585]  Okay, so the catch is that this guy Rick Joyner, you know, often brags that he is a Knight of Malta.
[01:34:15.805 --> 01:34:29.328]  So, you know, one of the things he's always preaching for the last ten years or so, that there's this big coming civil war in the church between those who will accept the, quote, new move of God versus those who oppose it.
[01:34:29.968 --> 01:34:31.729]  Now, what do you think of that in relation
[01:34:33.769 --> 01:34:37.050]  To, you know, the latest things with the FEMA pastors and all that sort of thing.
[01:34:37.410 --> 01:34:41.111]  Do you think there's a bigger, you know, like a CIA infiltration?
[01:34:41.851 --> 01:34:46.532]  Well, I'll tell you where we know of a CIA founding and control is World Vision.
[01:34:48.133 --> 01:34:51.373]  And they've got these so-called refugee camps and missionary camps all over the world.
[01:34:52.074 --> 01:34:57.575]  And World Vision, openly, the shooter of John Lennon was World Vision.
[01:34:58.215 --> 01:35:01.436]  The shooter of Ronald Reagan was World Vision.
[01:35:02.677 --> 01:35:04.238]  Now that was run by the Hinckley's.
[01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:06.641]  Serious mind control.
[01:35:06.661 --> 01:35:12.866]  I don't know about the guy you're mentioning or that, but certainly governments have always tried to infiltrate religion and youth churches.
[01:35:13.807 --> 01:35:16.089]  Clearly Jim Jones, that was a huge government op.
[01:35:18.291 --> 01:35:24.536]  Well, and then you remember Pat Robertson was running his little operation during the Iran conflict.
[01:35:24.817 --> 01:35:29.641]  He was flying planes back and forth under Operation Blessing is what he called it.
[01:35:30.578 --> 01:35:31.298]  That was kind of interesting.
[01:35:31.318 --> 01:35:32.759]  That was concurrent.
[01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:39.643]  By the way, last point I saw, you know, you were talking about Zarqawi, and now they're going to bring out their new guy.
[01:35:39.663 --> 01:35:40.684]  I saw that on CNN today.
[01:35:40.724 --> 01:35:43.326]  They have their new boogeyman shown.
[01:35:43.346 --> 01:35:46.247]  I forget his name, but you know, the new face of Al Qaeda.
[01:35:46.307 --> 01:35:48.168]  So that's just what you said it would be.
[01:35:48.749 --> 01:35:49.209]  That's right.
[01:35:49.249 --> 01:35:50.350]  I appreciate your call.
[01:35:51.470 --> 01:35:53.171]  It's really a pretty simple script.
[01:35:53.332 --> 01:35:54.092]  It's juvenile.
[01:35:55.373 --> 01:35:58.495]  Let's go ahead and talk to Derek in Toronto, Canada.
[01:35:58.515 --> 01:35:59.075]  Thanks for holding.
[01:35:59.813 --> 01:36:00.834]  Hey Alex, how are you doing today?
[01:36:00.874 --> 01:36:01.034]  Good!
[01:36:02.055 --> 01:36:03.956]  I just got a question and a comment.
[01:36:04.776 --> 01:36:06.277]  I'm just wondering who inspired you?
[01:36:06.518 --> 01:36:13.222]  Do you have any big-time role models that got you involved in the fight against the New World Order?
[01:36:15.043 --> 01:36:16.164]  Okay, and then what's your comment?
[01:36:17.065 --> 01:36:18.145]  I also have a comment.
[01:36:18.325 --> 01:36:27.432]  I'm just wondering if you've ever heard of... There's a speech by JFK on... He was against, I guess,
[01:36:29.591 --> 01:36:30.092]  The Illuminati?
[01:36:30.112 --> 01:36:33.977]  That's right, and it was against anything that is done in secret.
[01:36:47.446 --> 01:36:51.768]  Yes, you can find the text on his own presidential center.
[01:36:52.169 --> 01:36:53.630]  It's a well-known speech.
[01:36:53.870 --> 01:36:55.170]  It's a great speech, great speech.
[01:36:55.611 --> 01:36:56.711]  It's about a minute in length.
[01:36:57.011 --> 01:36:58.412]  Am I able to play that for your listeners?
[01:36:58.612 --> 01:36:59.813]  I think everybody should hear it.
[01:36:59.933 --> 01:37:02.214]  Yeah, I have never actually heard the speech.
[01:37:02.274 --> 01:37:03.835]  I've just read the text.
[01:37:03.875 --> 01:37:04.436]  Please play it.
[01:37:04.476 --> 01:37:11.880]  He actually said that there would be an increased need for security and the people that would seize it are the ones that would take away our liberties.
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:12.800]  Okay, go ahead and play it.
[01:37:13.261 --> 01:37:13.921]  Okay, here we go.
[01:37:15.660 --> 01:37:19.903]  The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society.
[01:37:20.824 --> 01:37:30.091]  And we are, as a people, inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths, and to secret proceedings.
[01:37:31.172 --> 01:37:42.661]  We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweigh the dangers which are cited to justify it.
[01:37:43.761 --> 01:37:44.302]  Even today,
[01:37:45.353 --> 01:37:51.875]  There is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions.
[01:37:52.976 --> 01:38:00.739]  Even today, there is little value in ensuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it.
[01:38:01.919 --> 01:38:14.604]  And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship
[01:38:16.855 --> 01:38:20.617]  That I do not intend to permit to the extent that it's in my control.
[01:38:21.718 --> 01:38:41.709]  And no official of my administration, whether his rank is high or low, civilian or military, should interpret my words here tonight as an excuse to censor the news, to stifle dissent, to cover up our mistakes, or to withhold from the press and the public the facts they deserve to know.
[01:38:42.949 --> 01:38:43.770]  But I do ask
[01:38:45.265 --> 01:38:46.426]  I think that's a great speech.
[01:38:46.566 --> 01:38:47.267]  Hey, do me a favor.
[01:38:47.307 --> 01:38:48.007]  Is that video?
[01:38:49.128 --> 01:38:49.409]  You know what?
[01:38:49.429 --> 01:38:50.830]  I do have a video of that.
[01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:52.331]  What is the name of the video?
[01:38:53.852 --> 01:38:57.336]  Actually, I went and did a lot of research and I got it off the internet.
[01:38:57.356 --> 01:38:58.036]  I downloaded it.
[01:38:58.076 --> 01:38:59.477]  I could send it to you.
[01:38:59.517 --> 01:39:01.359]  Listen, I'm totally blown away by that.
[01:39:01.779 --> 01:39:03.101]  It's great because, you know what?
[01:39:03.841 --> 01:39:05.282]  It stays in effect for today.
[01:39:05.503 --> 01:39:06.303]  Well, listen.
[01:39:06.904 --> 01:39:08.285]  I want that immediately.
[01:39:10.194 --> 01:39:13.895]  Can I get your phone number and can I give you a secret email to send that to right now?
[01:39:13.915 --> 01:39:14.756]  Definitely.
[01:39:15.016 --> 01:39:15.976]  Are you able to attach it?
[01:39:16.796 --> 01:39:17.376]  I could, yeah.
[01:39:18.197 --> 01:39:18.897]  Can you do it right now?
[01:39:18.917 --> 01:39:20.678]  Yeah, I could do that.
[01:39:22.918 --> 01:39:27.480]  I want to come back to you... Scott, we're going to put him on hold in a second.
[01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:31.381]  I want to get his number and I want you to give him my secret email address.
[01:39:32.482 --> 01:39:33.302]  Yes, give him that.
[01:39:34.942 --> 01:39:35.823]  It's not that secret.
[01:39:36.243 --> 01:39:39.364]  It's a couple hundred emails a day now, but we try to keep one that's not too full.
[01:39:40.220 --> 01:39:42.901]  And how quick can you send that to me, because I'll get that posted?
[01:39:43.781 --> 01:39:44.802]  Within five minutes.
[01:39:45.122 --> 01:39:45.522]  I can do that.
[01:39:45.742 --> 01:39:47.503]  Now, that didn't sound like the whole speech, though.
[01:39:47.523 --> 01:39:48.003]  There's more.
[01:39:48.083 --> 01:39:50.504]  And by the way, that's a separate speech than the one I was talking about.
[01:39:51.064 --> 01:39:51.304]  Okay.
[01:39:51.744 --> 01:39:52.124]  Yeah, it is.
[01:39:52.224 --> 01:39:53.184]  It's about an hour speech.
[01:39:53.465 --> 01:39:54.685]  It was for the press.
[01:39:55.105 --> 01:39:56.045]  Where did you find that?
[01:39:57.306 --> 01:39:58.366]  I went to a library.
[01:39:58.906 --> 01:40:03.548]  I think it was... I'm not even sure of the website after that.
[01:40:03.688 --> 01:40:04.868]  What format do you have it in now?
[01:40:06.449 --> 01:40:07.669]  Right now it's Windows Media.
[01:40:08.610 --> 01:40:09.570]  So you have it on a disk?
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:13.261]  I have it on a file and it's on a disk as well, yeah.
[01:40:13.641 --> 01:40:16.683]  Great, but what I'm saying is it's not too big to attach and send me?
[01:40:17.423 --> 01:40:18.164]  No, it's not that big.
[01:40:18.864 --> 01:40:19.244]  You're sure?
[01:40:19.985 --> 01:40:20.185]  Yeah.
[01:40:20.205 --> 01:40:21.445]  Because I'm salivating right now.
[01:40:22.626 --> 01:40:24.147]  Literally, I actually have a sandwich in front of me.
[01:40:24.167 --> 01:40:25.888]  That speech totally blew my mind.
[01:40:25.908 --> 01:40:32.471]  Okay, well is it the same speech where he gets into the secret government and says they're criminals?
[01:40:34.289 --> 01:40:35.369]  I haven't heard the whole speech.
[01:40:35.409 --> 01:40:38.711]  I just kind of highlighted that part of it because it made the most sense.
[01:40:38.771 --> 01:40:42.752]  Okay, well I want to get your number in case we are unable to get it properly.
[01:40:42.772 --> 01:40:45.153]  I want you to burn me a disc and mail it if it can make it out of Canada.
[01:40:45.173 --> 01:40:46.453]  It's such a control system.
[01:40:47.734 --> 01:40:48.994]  Mark it a cartoon or something.
[01:40:49.014 --> 01:40:49.835]  Maybe it'll make it through.
[01:40:49.855 --> 01:40:55.977]  I'm told porn has no problem going back and forth, but anything political gets stopped.
[01:40:56.517 --> 01:40:59.558]  Now anything else you want to add before we give you... I'm going to give you my office number.
[01:40:59.618 --> 01:41:01.599]  I want your number and I want you to email me that right now.
[01:41:02.159 --> 01:41:02.359]  Great.
[01:41:02.899 --> 01:41:05.820]  Or if you have to, you can upload it to YouTube or something, too.
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:06.820]  That's another good way to do it.
[01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:08.381]  You know how to do that?
[01:41:09.081 --> 01:41:09.781]  Yeah, I know how to do that.
[01:41:09.901 --> 01:41:11.081]  I just had that question for you.
[01:41:11.121 --> 01:41:13.162]  I want to know who inspired Alex Jones.
[01:41:13.402 --> 01:41:13.782]  Oh, yeah.
[01:41:13.802 --> 01:41:14.522]  Your role models.
[01:41:15.022 --> 01:41:22.544]  You know, I just read a lot of history and saw that governments were tyrannical, and that our media was telling us that it wasn't, and that I knew we were losing our freedoms.
[01:41:23.205 --> 01:41:25.125]  And I think I was inspired by our founding fathers.
[01:41:25.645 --> 01:41:27.866]  But I think more than that, I was just inspired by my family.
[01:41:29.128 --> 01:41:35.810]  The folks in my family on both sides are all pretty upright, you know, just mainstream, salt of the earth, farmer types.
[01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:39.591]  You know, they all basically came in as pioneers.
[01:41:40.731 --> 01:41:48.854]  You know, I had a lot of... I had family on the Mayflower, family in the Revolutionary War, the highest and lowest levels, family in the Texas Independence.
[01:41:49.414 --> 01:41:51.854]  And I... It's a synthesis.
[01:41:51.894 --> 01:41:53.975]  I mean, a lot of it is genetic.
[01:41:53.995 --> 01:41:55.735]  And all Americans, you know, have this.
[01:41:55.755 --> 01:41:57.496]  If you're a black American,
[01:41:58.101 --> 01:42:00.625]  Roughly half the Africans would die coming over on ships.
[01:42:00.685 --> 01:42:02.828]  Survival of the fittest, right there.
[01:42:03.969 --> 01:42:08.035]  If you're a white American, most of us came here as indentured servants, basically white slaves.
[01:42:09.057 --> 01:42:11.260]  We went through great adversity.
[01:42:11.340 --> 01:42:14.064]  Most people, and I'm not saying Europeans aren't tough or cool or smart,
[01:42:14.702 --> 01:42:24.591]  A lot of them were doing well, so they stayed, but normally it was the downtrodden, the criminals, the rebels that came here, and so then we all interbred together.
[01:42:25.151 --> 01:42:29.535]  And so really, I've just innately always been not a rebel in a bad way.
[01:42:29.955 --> 01:42:30.916]  I've never liked bullies.
[01:42:31.457 --> 01:42:38.823]  I've always liked it when some big guy comes up and starts trying something with me, and it's probably not a good thing, but I like seeing them hit the ground, their head bust open.
[01:42:39.203 --> 01:42:41.986]  That sounds really mean, folks, but I mean, that's just how I am.
[01:42:43.047 --> 01:42:44.368]  I don't like fighting little guys.
[01:42:44.388 --> 01:42:45.970]  I don't like being a bully myself.
[01:42:46.531 --> 01:42:48.173]  It's just at an instinctive level.
[01:42:48.213 --> 01:42:53.038]  I like it excited when a couple guys in a parking lot smart off to me.
[01:42:53.299 --> 01:42:54.720]  It's really bad in a way.
[01:42:56.102 --> 01:43:00.067]  But I've taken that energy and put it into other places.
[01:43:01.949 --> 01:43:03.610]  And again, I'm not advocating fighting, folks.
[01:43:03.650 --> 01:43:07.632]  I've been hurt real bad, you know, back when I used to do that in high school and some in college.
[01:43:08.692 --> 01:43:11.393]  So I've realized the pen is mightier than the sword.
[01:43:11.814 --> 01:43:12.734]  I've never liked bullies.
[01:43:12.774 --> 01:43:13.794]  I've never liked scum.
[01:43:14.995 --> 01:43:16.616]  And it's not like I'm even some good guy.
[01:43:16.676 --> 01:43:17.556]  It's like instinctive.
[01:43:17.656 --> 01:43:19.777]  I don't like control freaks.
[01:43:19.837 --> 01:43:20.738]  I'm threatened by them.
[01:43:21.318 --> 01:43:23.719]  I'm instinctively... I guess that was always an instinct I had.
[01:43:24.562 --> 01:43:25.403]  To protect.
[01:43:25.943 --> 01:43:28.785]  An instinct I had, kind of like a sheepdog, to protect from wolves.
[01:43:29.305 --> 01:43:35.369]  I never knew why I hated bullies so much, or why they made me so angry, or why I enjoyed knocking them down to size.
[01:43:36.110 --> 01:43:41.754]  But really, that's something that's innately in all of us, because it goes back to a tribalism of defending your tribe.
[01:43:42.234 --> 01:43:43.635]  That's what real war is.
[01:43:43.735 --> 01:43:51.520]  War is about when the enemy comes over the hill into your village, and they're going to rape and kill your women, take your children, and kill you.
[01:43:51.841 --> 01:43:53.001]  You're going to go pedal to the metal.
[01:43:53.021 --> 01:43:53.862]  You're going to attack them.
[01:43:54.222 --> 01:43:55.142]  It's not even courage.
[01:43:55.202 --> 01:43:55.942]  It's survival.
[01:43:56.603 --> 01:43:59.063]  And so, really sir, I think it's instinctive.
[01:43:59.083 --> 01:44:00.304]  It's also spiritual.
[01:44:00.944 --> 01:44:02.884]  And so that's really what it comes down to.
[01:44:02.904 --> 01:44:04.204]  That's great.
[01:44:04.224 --> 01:44:06.565]  I think inside we all know that there is something wrong.
[01:44:06.605 --> 01:44:08.125]  We can all do our part in some way.
[01:44:09.026 --> 01:44:12.426]  And instinctively we have that in-depth feeling.
[01:44:12.446 --> 01:44:13.187]  You know what I mean?
[01:44:13.907 --> 01:44:14.487]  Absolutely.
[01:44:15.507 --> 01:44:17.349]  I mean, it's simple.
[01:44:17.409 --> 01:44:26.056]  Some big bully hauls off and knocks you upside the head, and you just get fired up, and it's a good, healthy thing to want to fight back.
[01:44:26.657 --> 01:44:31.621]  And again, it's invigorating to see your enemies defeated when they started, and the sand hit the ground.
[01:44:32.442 --> 01:44:34.864]  And really, that's what it comes down to in the political world.
[01:44:35.204 --> 01:44:36.565]  We can swarm these people.
[01:44:36.605 --> 01:44:37.246]  We can beat them.
[01:44:37.839 --> 01:44:38.779]  We can take them down.
[01:44:38.799 --> 01:44:40.680]  There's more of them than there are of them.
[01:44:41.020 --> 01:44:42.500]  There's more of us than there are of them.
[01:44:42.540 --> 01:44:43.900]  Yes, we just have to have the will.
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:46.040]  Listen, I'm excited that you found that clip.
[01:44:46.841 --> 01:44:54.102]  Let me put you on hold, and, uh, Derek, and let me get your number, let us give you our number, and then we'll give you this email.
[01:44:54.222 --> 01:44:55.402]  Please send it immediately.
[01:44:56.022 --> 01:44:56.562]  Sounds good, Alex.
[01:44:56.942 --> 01:44:57.462]  Thanks a lot.
[01:44:57.502 --> 01:44:59.063]  That was a really exciting phone call.
[01:44:59.763 --> 01:45:05.964]  Now I sound like some 70 IQ caveman thumping my breast.
[01:45:06.769 --> 01:45:15.836]  But he asked the question, you know, he brought up the question of, uh, you know, why do you do this?
[01:45:16.096 --> 01:45:20.780]  And it's just... I do it because it's instinctive.
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:22.161]  It's in my bones.
[01:45:23.842 --> 01:45:30.307]  I am disgusted by cops pulling people over and acting like we're slaves and somehow we're bad and talking down to us.
[01:45:30.327 --> 01:45:32.108]  You're not supposed to do that, you fools!
[01:45:33.870 --> 01:45:34.770]  That's not your place.
[01:45:34.890 --> 01:45:35.531]  I resent it.
[01:45:36.340 --> 01:45:37.060]  I don't like it.
[01:45:37.741 --> 01:45:40.042]  But I've gone way past just hating bullies.
[01:45:40.102 --> 01:45:41.522]  Most of them I know are just damaged.
[01:45:42.023 --> 01:45:42.803]  They're stupid.
[01:45:43.483 --> 01:45:44.484]  They're not informed.
[01:45:44.864 --> 01:45:48.066]  They somehow got an ego boost sometime in their life on the playground.
[01:45:48.586 --> 01:45:50.407]  Picking on a three-year-old when they were five.
[01:45:51.227 --> 01:45:54.028]  Then they're fourteen, picking on a ten-year-old.
[01:45:54.449 --> 01:45:56.369]  Then they're eighteen, picking on a sixteen-year-old.
[01:45:56.970 --> 01:45:58.390]  Or somebody who's smaller than them.
[01:45:58.991 --> 01:46:01.732]  And that's kind of the law of bullies.
[01:46:02.092 --> 01:46:03.793]  And then they just get into life and they do this.
[01:46:04.637 --> 01:46:15.681]  I remember having jobs, and I never really got picked on on jobs, because I've always been, I guess for some reason, a little bit popular wherever I was, and just friendly, and it seems like bullies seemed to pretty much leave me alone in many cases.
[01:46:16.122 --> 01:46:23.405]  But I remember working at fast food joints, or Walmart, or wherever, or on a golf course, and watching these bullies be mean to people and get off on it.
[01:46:24.285 --> 01:46:25.946]  And they get a sense of pride.
[01:46:25.966 --> 01:46:27.046]  They get a sense of power.
[01:46:27.466 --> 01:46:28.707]  They like to control people.
[01:46:29.787 --> 01:46:31.948]  What I want from other people is camaraderie.
[01:46:32.481 --> 01:46:33.042]  Friendship.
[01:46:33.142 --> 01:46:33.902]  Them to like me.
[01:46:34.423 --> 01:46:36.264]  To share ideas with them.
[01:46:36.644 --> 01:46:39.447]  To have shared communal events.
[01:46:40.447 --> 01:46:41.728]  I'm in the human stream.
[01:46:42.669 --> 01:46:43.490]  I'm just a person.
[01:46:43.670 --> 01:46:46.572]  I'm just a... I really am just a caveman, folks.
[01:46:47.433 --> 01:46:53.658]  And I see clear threats to myself, to my species, by a bunch of out-of-control nuts.
[01:46:54.239 --> 01:46:55.199]  And I want to bring them down.
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:57.281]  I mean, really, at the end of the day, that's it.
[01:46:58.222 --> 01:47:00.984]  And my instincts really could care less about myself.
[01:47:02.112 --> 01:47:06.555]  I mean, believe me folks, your tribes didn't survive for no reason.
[01:47:06.615 --> 01:47:09.896]  You're here because your ancestors fought for you.
[01:47:10.817 --> 01:47:13.999]  Or you're here because when they were slaves they were hardy or they didn't survive.
[01:47:15.199 --> 01:47:23.344]  And when the enemy, again let's go back 6-7 thousand years ago, let's say you're a small village, a band of 200 people, and there's another marauding band that comes in with 500,
[01:47:24.522 --> 01:47:28.985]  You know, in many cases, the smaller band could drive off the bigger, because they were fighting for their lives.
[01:47:29.486 --> 01:47:36.330]  And the enemy, once they saw how many casualties they took, would back off and would remove themselves and say, we need to leave that tribe alone.
[01:47:36.350 --> 01:47:39.433]  And believe me, when our ancestors, whether you're black, white, I don't care.
[01:47:39.913 --> 01:47:41.314]  Whether you're Asian, it doesn't matter.
[01:47:41.654 --> 01:47:48.839]  When our ancestors would, you know, wearing their fur skins, folks, with their clubs, with their spears, would charge in, they were not afraid.
[01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:52.622]  I mean, once the enemy comes in on you, you're not afraid.
[01:47:53.340 --> 01:47:53.640]  Okay?
[01:47:53.820 --> 01:47:56.962]  I mean, in the animal world, there's fight or flight.
[01:47:56.982 --> 01:47:58.163]  You either run or you fight.
[01:47:58.863 --> 01:48:01.645]  What we do today is we just sit here cringing like sheep.
[01:48:01.665 --> 01:48:03.686]  You ever watch the sheep when a wolf comes up on them?
[01:48:03.706 --> 01:48:04.566]  I've seen video of it.
[01:48:04.586 --> 01:48:06.627]  They literally lay over and let them eat their guts.
[01:48:06.667 --> 01:48:07.968]  They lay there, taking it.
[01:48:07.988 --> 01:48:10.589]  Okay, we're not sheep, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48:10.910 --> 01:48:16.112]  And so if the enemy's going to fight me, I may die, I may lose, then they put me in prison and rip my eyeballs out.
[01:48:16.353 --> 01:48:17.033]  I just don't care.
[01:48:17.899 --> 01:48:18.239]  Okay?
[01:48:18.539 --> 01:48:22.322]  Because they can't take away the work I've done, the things I've done, even if they break me in the future.
[01:48:22.422 --> 01:48:23.002]  I'm ready for it.
[01:48:23.362 --> 01:48:24.343]  I'm ready to go all the way.
[01:48:24.363 --> 01:48:25.443]  I'm ready to be boiled in oil.
[01:48:25.724 --> 01:48:25.904]  Okay?
[01:48:25.964 --> 01:48:26.584]  I don't care.
[01:48:27.104 --> 01:48:27.284]  Okay?
[01:48:27.325 --> 01:48:28.565]  I'm fully committed.
[01:48:28.705 --> 01:48:29.506]  I've already won.
[01:48:29.786 --> 01:48:31.207]  And the enemy came into my village.
[01:48:31.247 --> 01:48:32.968]  The enemy has attacked my tribe.
[01:48:33.008 --> 01:48:34.289]  The enemy has come up against me.
[01:48:34.609 --> 01:48:35.709]  I am going to fight them.
[01:48:37.710 --> 01:48:38.411]  It's really simple.
[01:48:39.992 --> 01:48:40.952]  I'm never going to stop.
[01:48:41.072 --> 01:48:41.573]  I'm committed.
[01:48:41.713 --> 01:48:43.694]  Listen, you're in a better position fighting
[01:48:44.409 --> 01:48:55.720]  Are you just going to lay there and let them take your children, put them on drugs, let them take your bank accounts, let them devalue your dollar, let them put poison in your water, and we have the declassified documents where they brag about how it's meant to brain damage you?
[01:48:56.440 --> 01:48:57.862]  I mean, this isn't a joke, people!
[01:48:58.863 --> 01:49:05.349]  And they've got all these minions, all these bullies, all these people that'll serve them because they feel like they're part of the power system, and this is how they exercise power.
[01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:10.141]  You think you're getting power out of being a thug, but you're not happy inside.
[01:49:10.181 --> 01:49:14.483]  Your brain, your very design, God's handiwork, is telling you that you're not meant to live like this.
[01:49:14.883 --> 01:49:16.204]  You're meant to make hard decisions.
[01:49:16.224 --> 01:49:17.424]  You're meant to stand up for the weak.
[01:49:17.804 --> 01:49:22.326]  You know, it feels... I've never taken heroin, but I would describe it like taking heroin.
[01:49:22.766 --> 01:49:24.007]  You know, the euphoria.
[01:49:25.607 --> 01:49:29.649]  There is something euphoric doing good, but more than just doing good, really doing good.
[01:49:29.669 --> 01:49:33.370]  You know, the globalists are good at misdirecting good people to think they're doing good, they're really doing evil.
[01:49:34.458 --> 01:49:36.581]  I mean, it is addictive to be good.
[01:49:36.621 --> 01:49:37.983]  It is addictive to be brave.
[01:49:38.264 --> 01:49:39.125]  It is addictive.
[01:49:39.806 --> 01:49:40.988]  I'm just ready!
[01:49:41.248 --> 01:49:43.151]  I mean, the enemy's coming in on us.
[01:49:43.311 --> 01:49:47.838]  I'm gonna pick my club up and I'm gonna knock their brains out, figuratively and physically, if I need to.
[01:49:48.198 --> 01:49:49.100]  I'm gonna take them on!
[01:49:51.425 --> 01:49:59.672]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[01:49:59.872 --> 01:50:02.215]  We're expecting around a thousand people in attendance.
[01:50:02.815 --> 01:50:11.663]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[01:50:12.183 --> 01:50:15.864]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neo-Con Agenda.
[01:50:16.124 --> 01:50:24.466]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lt.
[01:50:24.506 --> 01:50:24.826]  Col.
[01:50:24.846 --> 01:50:36.928]  Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Charnley, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[01:50:37.248 --> 01:50:40.989]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[01:50:41.449 --> 01:50:42.691]  Arm yourself with the truth.
[01:50:43.071 --> 01:50:48.338]  Secure your tickets today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:50:51.821 --> 01:50:57.046]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:57.186 --> 01:51:05.275]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:05.535 --> 01:51:12.602]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:12.782 --> 01:51:14.043]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[01:51:14.123 --> 01:51:20.027]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:20.207 --> 01:51:25.291]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:25.411 --> 01:51:34.297]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:34.557 --> 01:51:37.860]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:51:39.941 --> 01:51:44.644]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:44.804 --> 01:51:48.246]  Call now and get free shipping.
[01:51:48.306 --> 01:51:49.386]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:51:49.587 --> 01:51:58.892]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:51:59.112 --> 01:52:01.373]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:52:01.553 --> 01:52:07.897]  We provide outstanding products like ECAC, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:52:08.237 --> 01:52:08.898]  We're good to go!
[01:52:37.757 --> 01:52:40.861]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:41.022 --> 01:52:46.890]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:53:20.221 --> 01:53:25.662]  If you don't have a choice, you gotta stand your ground.
[01:53:26.042 --> 01:53:29.403]  Or you can roll over like a sheep, so terrified by the wolf.
[01:53:30.643 --> 01:53:32.124]  You're not sheep, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:33.844 --> 01:53:38.705]  The adversity our ancestors universally went through is so huge, so unbelievable.
[01:53:38.765 --> 01:53:40.726]  I don't know how we couldn't fight this thing.
[01:53:40.746 --> 01:53:42.266]  I don't know how we couldn't get involved.
[01:53:44.033 --> 01:53:46.335]  We can just believe the propaganda, I guess, and buy into it.
[01:53:46.615 --> 01:53:51.998]  Before I go back to your calls, Kurt Nemo is going to be popping in for a little while next hour to talk about Jerome Corsi and that interview.
[01:53:52.018 --> 01:53:59.122]  I also do have the article about gun confiscation going on in an area of the country, quote, to stop the criminals and keep us safe.
[01:53:59.163 --> 01:53:59.743]  I do have that.
[01:54:01.539 --> 01:54:06.301]  I found a sickening article about the Bilderberg Group out of a mainstream paper in Canada, Ottawa Express.
[01:54:06.361 --> 01:54:07.781]  What's so bad about Bilderberg?
[01:54:07.881 --> 01:54:09.182]  It is the most sickening thing.
[01:54:09.742 --> 01:54:11.523]  I thought it was tongue-in-cheek at first, but it's not.
[01:54:12.043 --> 01:54:15.624]  Worshipping them and worshipping world government, I want to go over some of that.
[01:54:16.845 --> 01:54:27.129]  By the way, if you want to learn about Bilderberg Group, in the 29 years he's been covering it, it's now 30, but the book came out last year, so the 29 years he covered it, all the people he confronted, David Rockefeller, Kissinger, Dick Cheney,
[01:54:28.513 --> 01:54:32.355]  The infiltrations, the times he was arrested, detained, the time he was shot at.
[01:54:32.376 --> 01:54:33.776]  I didn't even know Tucker was shot at.
[01:54:34.777 --> 01:54:36.498]  He was shot at in Portugal.
[01:54:37.859 --> 01:54:40.961]  The point is, you need to get his book, The Bilderberg Diary.
[01:54:40.981 --> 01:54:42.402]  It's full of photos, documents.
[01:54:42.502 --> 01:54:44.443]  It's a really easy read, but a great read.
[01:54:45.264 --> 01:54:46.504]  It's available at Infowars.com.
[01:54:48.442 --> 01:54:52.284]  To understand what the elite do spiritually, what they're into, get my new film The Order of Death.
[01:54:52.724 --> 01:54:58.487]  On the same DVD you get free the remastered, re-edited, updated Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove on the same DVD.
[01:54:58.507 --> 01:55:08.372]  So you get that new version of that and the new film The Order of Death for the price of one film on the same DVD or VHS depending on what you order.
[01:55:08.392 --> 01:55:09.433]  You need to get Road to Tyranny.
[01:55:09.453 --> 01:55:10.473]  You need to get Martial Law.
[01:55:10.513 --> 01:55:13.355]  You need to get the other books and videos I carry that other researchers have made.
[01:55:13.855 --> 01:55:15.716]  You get great films that will inform yourself
[01:55:16.863 --> 01:55:17.863]  We'll inform your neighbors.
[01:55:18.304 --> 01:55:21.845]  You're authorized and encouraged to make copies of my films for non-profit educational purposes.
[01:55:22.185 --> 01:55:24.806]  The power of you doing that, I just cannot describe it.
[01:55:25.246 --> 01:55:26.727]  Thank you for those that have done it.
[01:55:26.767 --> 01:55:27.207]  Keep it up.
[01:55:27.247 --> 01:55:29.307]  If you've got copies and haven't, please do it.
[01:55:29.608 --> 01:55:31.748]  If you haven't gotten original films from us, please do it.
[01:55:32.068 --> 01:55:33.509]  It all has an effect.
[01:55:33.929 --> 01:55:34.489]  It's huge.
[01:55:35.089 --> 01:55:38.491]  So go to InfoWars.com to order hard copies of the books, videos, t-shirts.
[01:55:38.751 --> 01:55:39.851]  It's all about getting the word out.
[01:55:40.311 --> 01:55:42.132]  Off the secure, safe online shopping cart.
[01:55:43.070 --> 01:55:44.391]  Or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:55:44.411 --> 01:55:44.731]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:55:44.751 --> 01:55:46.093]  Never forget PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:55:46.193 --> 01:55:47.213]  All 14 of my films.
[01:55:47.574 --> 01:55:52.317]  Terror Storm will be going up there late next week for you before it's even available on DVD.
[01:56:03.889 --> 01:56:09.934]  My Weekly TV Reports, my book, Paul Watson's book, a bunch of other films, we've been authorized to post up there at PrisonPlanet.tv or there.
[01:56:10.354 --> 01:56:15.959]  PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day or get a yearly subscription instead of a monthly subscription and get three months free.
[01:56:16.860 --> 01:56:21.163]  And by the way, we're going to sell out the conference.
[01:56:21.183 --> 01:56:23.665]  There will be no tickets available at the door.
[01:56:24.786 --> 01:56:28.109]  And I predict the conference will sell out in the next three to four days.
[01:56:28.709 --> 01:56:32.692]  The current ticket sales and it's over 900 now.
[01:56:34.211 --> 01:56:38.014]  And the tickets are going to sell out very quickly.
[01:56:39.014 --> 01:56:40.315]  We've boosted it to 1,100.
[01:56:40.775 --> 01:56:41.916]  That's the most we can put in there.
[01:56:41.936 --> 01:56:44.358]  We still have room for the press and guests and others.
[01:56:45.318 --> 01:56:46.279]  It holds 1,200 people.
[01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:52.903]  And it's an event you don't want to miss with all these top scientists and former government officials exposing 9-11 as an inside job.
[01:56:53.504 --> 01:56:58.627]  If you want your tickets, you better get them now at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:57:02.308 --> 01:57:04.610]  And you just take your receipt, your email receipt ticket.
[01:57:04.911 --> 01:57:06.352]  It's too late to mail tickets out now.
[01:57:06.392 --> 01:57:07.133]  We did mail some out.
[01:57:07.153 --> 01:57:08.113]  People didn't want to do it that way.
[01:57:08.474 --> 01:57:09.695]  You just get that and that's your ticket.
[01:57:09.995 --> 01:57:11.997]  You just show that and you get a wristband.
[01:57:12.017 --> 01:57:13.538]  And then you're checked in.
[01:57:13.558 --> 01:57:15.900]  There's no checking in and out for the two days of the conference.
[01:57:16.301 --> 01:57:20.044]  It's coming up in nine days in downtown Los Angeles at the Sheraton.
[01:57:20.424 --> 01:57:21.565]  There's a lot of hotels in the area.
[01:57:22.706 --> 01:57:23.367]  It's going to be great.
[01:57:23.767 --> 01:57:24.628]  We hope to see you there.
[01:57:25.009 --> 01:57:26.049]  The tickets are almost gone.
[01:57:26.069 --> 01:57:26.530]  You better get them.
[01:57:31.272 --> 01:57:35.941]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:47.623 --> 01:57:48.263]  Big Brother.
[01:57:48.924 --> 01:57:49.984]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:50.705 --> 01:57:51.785]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:52.466 --> 01:57:53.266]  You want answers?
[01:57:54.027 --> 01:57:54.927]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:54.947 --> 01:57:59.290]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:59.770 --> 01:58:03.892]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.874 --> 01:58:09.275]  We're now into the third hour.
[01:58:09.295 --> 01:58:14.478]  I've got a report here of the police gearing up for more gun confiscation.
[01:58:17.535 --> 01:58:20.296]  I've got a report here from the Mainstream News praising the Bilderberg Group.
[01:58:20.336 --> 01:58:21.517]  It's totally disgusting.
[01:58:23.858 --> 01:58:31.662]  And we're also got, again, Curtin Emo coming up after this first break, just for about 10 minutes or so, that he wants to comment on Jerome Corsio I had on yesterday.
[01:58:32.622 --> 01:58:38.305]  Before we do that, let's go ahead and talk to Gideon in Louisiana and others.
[01:58:38.345 --> 01:58:38.946]  Go ahead, Gideon.
[01:58:40.006 --> 01:58:40.906]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:58:40.987 --> 01:58:41.467]  Good, sir.
[01:58:42.027 --> 01:58:45.549]  I just want to tell you a couple quick things here and praise you a little bit, but
[01:58:46.657 --> 01:58:53.579]  Number one, I don't know if you were aware, but in America, Destroyed by Design, your first film, you were in Atalanto near George Air Force Base.
[01:58:54.519 --> 01:58:56.480]  And George Air Force Base, are you there?
[01:58:57.560 --> 01:58:58.400]  Yes, I'm listening to you.
[01:58:58.720 --> 01:59:12.604]  Okay, and George Air Force Base, right across the street there's this security detention facility, and they're pouring $300 million into what is now formerly George Air Force Base.
[01:59:13.178 --> 01:59:20.184]  And I believe it's being done by Opus West, which its name, I mean, is completely... I mean, that's a Masonic moniker if I've ever heard one.
[01:59:20.884 --> 01:59:24.948]  But they're supposed to redo all the bases in the next, like, four years.
[01:59:25.328 --> 01:59:40.400]  The other thing is, on the Bohemian Grove, I was reading Man, Myth, and Magic at the local library, you know, looking at these Masonic symbols and whatnot, and I run across this little footnote that said that
[01:59:41.268 --> 01:59:47.192]  Normally, like in a sacrificial ritual, they'll soak rags in the victim's blood and burn them.
[01:59:48.613 --> 01:59:52.595]  And that completely freaked me out after having read all the stuff that they were doing.
[01:59:52.615 --> 01:59:55.277]  You know, Senator John DeCamp and so on.
[01:59:55.297 --> 01:59:56.578]  That's right.
[01:59:56.618 --> 02:00:01.180]  They have these rags bound around a metal skeleton that they burn.
[02:00:01.921 --> 02:00:03.162]  That's actually what they do.
[02:00:03.222 --> 02:00:07.104]  They kill somebody, then they use their blood and their ashes in other rituals.
[02:00:08.285 --> 02:00:09.005]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:00:09.105 --> 02:00:10.346]  So, I mean, you know,
[02:00:11.340 --> 02:00:12.861]  It's not just burning rags.
[02:00:12.901 --> 02:00:15.742]  I mean, it's potentially burning the blood of an infant victim.
[02:00:17.083 --> 02:00:21.365]  The other thing I wanted to say is, you know, I mean, when you look at all this, it's deeply spiritual.
[02:00:21.405 --> 02:00:24.986]  And I could tell the Holy Spirit was working through you when you were up there at Bilderberg.
[02:00:25.026 --> 02:00:26.267]  And I would just thank God.
[02:00:26.667 --> 02:00:30.809]  And I just want to encourage everybody out there to continue to pray for you.
[02:00:31.628 --> 02:00:38.650]  And even right now, if you're in your car, just start praying for this country and start praying for Alex and for the protection of his family.
[02:00:38.670 --> 02:00:42.992]  You know, we love liberty and we love God and we're going to stand up for the truth and die for it if necessary.
[02:00:43.032 --> 02:00:43.772]  God bless you, Alex.
[02:00:44.072 --> 02:00:45.232]  I appreciate that call.
[02:00:45.292 --> 02:00:46.673]  Very, very nice words there.
[02:00:46.713 --> 02:00:47.333]  I agree with you.
[02:00:47.953 --> 02:00:51.634]  Let's go ahead and talk to Michael in Illinois.
[02:00:51.654 --> 02:00:52.234]  You're on the air.
[02:00:52.254 --> 02:00:56.136]  Hello?
[02:00:56.676 --> 02:00:56.976]  Yes, sir.
[02:00:57.321 --> 02:01:00.963]  Hey Alex, I deeply regret missing you here in Chicago.
[02:01:01.083 --> 02:01:02.104]  I'm right downtown.
[02:01:02.124 --> 02:01:03.264]  You're out there bullhorning.
[02:01:03.304 --> 02:01:04.425]  I saw it after the fact.
[02:01:04.505 --> 02:01:05.226]  I'm working hard.
[02:01:05.866 --> 02:01:08.127]  And I just deeply missed seeing you.
[02:01:08.327 --> 02:01:10.969]  I appreciate all of the words that you had to say.
[02:01:10.989 --> 02:01:15.271]  I'm a strong advocate of the martial law series and a road attorney.
[02:01:15.351 --> 02:01:17.132]  I email as much as I possibly can.
[02:01:17.152 --> 02:01:21.915]  I work in software development and a lot of these guys are blind as I don't know what.
[02:01:22.556 --> 02:01:24.817]  I do have a big question for you and that's on Lou Dobbs.
[02:01:25.638 --> 02:01:31.883]  I've been checking out Lou Dobbs for the past few weeks or so, and very, very strong words against the establishment.
[02:01:31.903 --> 02:01:33.944]  He's talking about the Pan-American Union.
[02:01:34.545 --> 02:01:35.846]  He's calling the government criminals.
[02:01:36.686 --> 02:01:49.756]  My question, especially in light of the earlier guest from the Bilderberg Group, or who monitored the Bilderberg Group, do you believe that Dobbs is a control valve?
[02:01:50.236 --> 02:01:55.360]  I knew that O'Reilly, eight, nine years ago, when he first did a good show to get an audience, was bad, and I said that.
[02:01:56.363 --> 02:02:04.528]  Dobbs, I get the feeling, and I know about his contract, it's public, he left for a while and came back and basically has a contract to do whatever he wants.
[02:02:05.709 --> 02:02:11.312]  And he's one of the few shows that has good ratings on CNN because he's saying what the people agree with and what's true.
[02:02:12.153 --> 02:02:18.316]  I have seen him do things, you know, where he soft-pedals, but I think Dobbs is getting away with what he can.
[02:02:18.416 --> 02:02:25.921]  Right now, the mainline media is losing all its viewers, so they're trying to allow some truth to come out.
[02:02:26.522 --> 02:02:27.664]  Through some of their people.
[02:02:28.325 --> 02:02:29.766]  I don't know the heart of Lou Dobbs.
[02:02:30.487 --> 02:02:31.549]  I tend to like him.
[02:02:32.170 --> 02:02:33.932]  But, you know, I could be wrong about him.
[02:02:35.915 --> 02:02:36.836]  Does that answer your question?
[02:02:36.856 --> 02:02:37.617]  I mean, I don't know.
[02:02:37.637 --> 02:02:40.280]  Yeah, it certainly does and I feel the same way.
[02:02:40.300 --> 02:02:40.761]  Well, stay there.
[02:02:40.801 --> 02:02:41.562]  I'll come back to you later.
[02:02:43.464 --> 02:02:51.727]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[02:02:51.907 --> 02:02:54.248]  We're expecting around 1,000 people in attendance.
[02:02:54.848 --> 02:03:03.691]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[02:03:04.231 --> 02:03:07.753]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda.
[02:03:08.173 --> 02:03:28.981]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Turnbull, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[02:03:29.301 --> 02:03:33.023]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[02:03:33.483 --> 02:03:34.764]  Arm yourself with the truth.

[02:03:44.352 --> 02:03:47.335]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:03:47.695 --> 02:03:56.523]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:03:56.843 --> 02:04:01.507]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:04:01.987 --> 02:04:08.710]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:04:09.110 --> 02:04:20.875]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:21.355 --> 02:04:25.819]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.322]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:28.342 --> 02:04:30.303]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[02:04:47.460 --> 02:04:48.341]  Look no further!

[02:05:01.493 --> 02:05:01.713]  I think so.
[02:05:17.890 --> 02:05:18.451]  I think so.
[02:05:36.624 --> 02:05:38.545]  To Northern Voice Bookstore, P.O.
[02:05:38.565 --> 02:05:42.068]  Box 281, Wildwood, PA 15091.
[02:05:43.149 --> 02:05:48.192]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:48.552 --> 02:05:50.814]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:06:05.678 --> 02:06:08.780]  Alright, we're now 8 minutes 30 seconds into this third hour.
[02:06:08.800 --> 02:06:14.863]  We're going to be going back to your calls and getting into some new Bilderberg Grip news and some gun grabbing news for you.
[02:06:14.923 --> 02:06:22.047]  Before we do that, Kurt Nemo has been a guest on this broadcast before and he has a great website that he can tell you about.
[02:06:22.647 --> 02:06:24.428]  And yesterday I was trying to speed through calls.
[02:06:24.488 --> 02:06:31.672]  We skipped ahead and put him in the front of the line to talk to Jerome Corsi who puts out a bunch of propaganda, a bunch of twisted information on Iran.
[02:06:31.692 --> 02:06:32.733]  I'm not saying Iran's perfect.
[02:06:33.547 --> 02:06:35.469]  Man, he has said some pretty wild things.
[02:06:35.509 --> 02:06:39.393]  I wasn't aware of the things he'd said that Kurt brought up.
[02:06:39.433 --> 02:06:42.095]  But then, of course, he admitted it, and I actually went after that and found them.
[02:06:43.497 --> 02:06:44.538]  So it's pretty powerful.
[02:06:45.203 --> 02:06:45.583]  Stuff.
[02:06:45.603 --> 02:06:47.764]  I don't want to make this whole show about Jerome Corsi.
[02:06:48.244 --> 02:06:50.745]  I mean, he's doing a good job on peak well-being of fraud.
[02:06:50.985 --> 02:06:53.766]  He's doing a good job on the open borders and the American Union.
[02:06:53.786 --> 02:06:59.087]  But so many people who are doing that then still support Bush and support the war and support all of this.
[02:06:59.147 --> 02:07:03.289]  So, you know, are they supporting these other issues to get us to trust them and to go along with them?
[02:07:03.909 --> 02:07:05.249]  Kurt Nemo, good to have you on with us.
[02:07:05.529 --> 02:07:06.370]  Hey, Alex.
[02:07:06.410 --> 02:07:07.110]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:07:07.290 --> 02:07:07.630]  You bet.
[02:07:07.670 --> 02:07:09.571]  You wanted to say some more things about him.
[02:07:10.151 --> 02:07:12.572]  Well, you know, the guy's a flaming neo-con.
[02:07:12.632 --> 02:07:13.232]  And you knew that.
[02:07:13.252 --> 02:07:14.052]  You pointed it out.
[02:07:15.086 --> 02:07:25.135]  He's right on about the American Union, but as far as the neocon agenda goes, he's right on with those guys.
[02:07:25.475 --> 02:07:28.178]  He's not just right on, he's a fervent cheerleader.
[02:07:28.939 --> 02:07:29.659]  Most definitely.
[02:07:29.679 --> 02:07:32.582]  He was being a little disingenuous yesterday.
[02:07:33.063 --> 02:07:35.405]  My question is, does a leopard change its spots?
[02:07:35.545 --> 02:07:38.348]  Does he still believe that about Islam and Muslims?
[02:07:38.368 --> 02:07:38.748]  I don't know.
[02:07:40.342 --> 02:07:49.331]  You know, his attitude about the Shia Muslims is, you know, leads me to believe that he hasn't really changed his opinion.
[02:07:49.351 --> 02:07:55.838]  But that's secondary to the fact that he wants to, it looks like he wants Israel to invade Iran.
[02:07:55.858 --> 02:07:57.039]  That's his point.
[02:07:58.826 --> 02:08:03.147]  Well, instead of responding to specifically what he says, just how about the neocon talking points?
[02:08:03.167 --> 02:08:05.527]  That they're going to go to NABOM when it's admitted fraud.
[02:08:05.867 --> 02:08:07.788]  Same crowd that lied before is lying again.
[02:08:07.808 --> 02:08:10.769]  All this stuff about how they want to destroy the planet.
[02:08:11.329 --> 02:08:14.169]  Oh, you know, they want to make Jews wear yellow stars again.
[02:08:14.189 --> 02:08:15.169]  It's the same stuff.
[02:08:15.189 --> 02:08:16.790]  Saddam threw babies out of incubators.
[02:08:16.810 --> 02:08:18.130]  Turned out that was a PR firm.
[02:08:18.510 --> 02:08:19.030]  All made up.
[02:08:19.310 --> 02:08:26.992]  I've researched most of their claims, and a few of them are true, but I'd have to say 90 plus percent of them are total, whole cloth, manufactured fictions.
[02:08:27.552 --> 02:08:28.612]  It's all propaganda.
[02:08:28.632 --> 02:08:36.094]  I mean, you take a look at the Neocon's papers of securing the realm and the PNAC policy papers, and it's obvious what they want to do.
[02:08:36.114 --> 02:08:38.194]  They want to go in there and balkanize the Middle East.
[02:08:38.874 --> 02:08:40.895]  You know, that's their plan.
[02:08:40.935 --> 02:08:42.915]  Well, they call it the strategy of balkanization.
[02:08:43.495 --> 02:08:50.876]  Yeah, well, actually, you know, Odin Yunon was an Israeli analyst who wrote about this in 1982, and he said that that's what Israel needs to do to its neighbors.
[02:08:51.237 --> 02:08:53.657]  You need to go in and balkanize them and create little fiefdoms.
[02:08:54.147 --> 02:08:57.308]  And appoint their leaders and just rule over them, roughshod.
[02:08:59.628 --> 02:09:01.028]  What do you see happening with Iran?
[02:09:01.788 --> 02:09:06.129]  Well, I think that, you know, I think that Corsi, or Corsair, however you pronounce the guy's name, is right.
[02:09:06.229 --> 02:09:08.129]  He, uh, you know, Israel will do something.
[02:09:08.510 --> 02:09:17.411]  They've been telling us for more than a year now that if the United States doesn't go in there and take out their supposed nukes or their facilities, that Israel will do it.
[02:09:17.771 --> 02:09:22.712]  And I think that's probably what will happen, and Corsair kind of pointed that out yesterday, is Israel will go in there
[02:09:23.380 --> 02:09:39.410]  And try to take out, which is a task that's impossible, because these so-called facilities are all over the country, they're in densely populated areas of their country, and they'll try to take them out, and what will happen, obviously, and the Iranians have pointed this out, is they will simply retaliate against Israel.
[02:09:40.513 --> 02:09:48.618]  Through Hezbollah and other means, and probably using some of their missiles with conventional weapons against Tel Aviv and some of the larger Israeli cities.
[02:09:48.978 --> 02:09:53.220]  And that'll be the cue for the United States to go in and protect its so-called friend.
[02:09:54.801 --> 02:09:58.083]  And Bush is talking about using nukes.
[02:09:58.203 --> 02:10:09.769]  Yeah, well, their nuclear posture review or whatever it is, points out that they think that it's fine to use their so-called mini-nukes as preemptive weapons against the Islamic State.
[02:10:12.142 --> 02:10:17.264]  And our government admits they overthrew Iran and their democratically elected government.
[02:10:17.304 --> 02:10:18.165]  It was pro-America.
[02:10:18.645 --> 02:10:19.945]  Corsi didn't even deny that.
[02:10:20.066 --> 02:10:22.286]  Our government carried out terror attacks against them.
[02:10:22.627 --> 02:10:23.547]  No wonder they hate us.
[02:10:24.367 --> 02:10:35.292]  In 1953, the CIA with Kermit Roosevelt plotted against their country and took out their government because Iran talked about nationalizing their oil.
[02:10:36.093 --> 02:10:37.073]  And the British didn't like that.
[02:10:39.375 --> 02:10:42.116]  In fact, Iran was almost getting none of the profits.
[02:10:42.696 --> 02:10:46.198]  Yeah, it was like a tenth of a percent or something ridiculous like that.
[02:10:46.218 --> 02:11:03.184]  But that's standard MO for these guys, is to go in there and appoint a corrupt leader, lavish him with riches, and build up his military like they built up Iran's military with the Savak, and then just basically steal all their assets, all their natural resources.
[02:11:04.084 --> 02:11:09.006]  And the Iranian people didn't want to do that in the 50s, and so they set up a coup d'etat.
[02:11:11.281 --> 02:11:13.102]  That's the truth and they can't deny it.
[02:11:14.482 --> 02:11:15.203]  Why do you think?
[02:11:15.223 --> 02:11:19.545]  I mean, obviously, Israel, for the globalists, wants to create a crisis to bring in world government.
[02:11:19.925 --> 02:11:23.526]  They say out of this World War 4, they will create their new world order.
[02:11:24.407 --> 02:11:26.288]  So, I think it's all part of a larger plan.
[02:11:26.308 --> 02:11:28.309]  They hope Iran will strike back of their attack.
[02:11:30.151 --> 02:11:31.431]  He's already framing the debate.
[02:11:32.031 --> 02:11:33.092]  How dare Iran?
[02:11:33.152 --> 02:11:35.152]  They're saying they'll fight back if we hit them.
[02:11:35.172 --> 02:11:42.934]  Have you ever heard of something so radical and so hateful and so militaristic that if we attack them, they're saying they'll actually fight back?
[02:11:43.294 --> 02:11:45.354]  Well, yeah, but it's because they're framed as terrorists.
[02:11:45.374 --> 02:11:50.455]  You know, for the last two decades, they've been framed as terrorists since their 79 revolution.
[02:11:51.215 --> 02:11:55.036]  And so that falls in the larger context of them being terrorists, you know.
[02:11:55.575 --> 02:11:56.696]  You know, we're doing something good.
[02:11:56.996 --> 02:11:58.357]  That's the basis of the argument.
[02:11:58.377 --> 02:12:01.119]  We're going in there, getting rid of these evil mullahs, and how dare they?
[02:12:01.139 --> 02:12:03.561]  You know, we're doing this for the Iranian people.
[02:12:03.601 --> 02:12:05.583]  How dare they, you know, do something like that?
[02:12:06.664 --> 02:12:09.346]  Just like Iraq was for the Iraqi people.
[02:12:09.586 --> 02:12:10.046]  Yeah.
[02:12:10.326 --> 02:12:10.567]  Right.
[02:12:10.587 --> 02:12:13.389]  And take a look at the malnourished.
[02:12:13.409 --> 02:12:14.710]  The kids are all malnourished.
[02:12:14.730 --> 02:12:18.933]  The water's poisoned and filled with depleted uraniums all over the country.
[02:12:18.973 --> 02:12:19.774]  The place is a mess.
[02:12:19.814 --> 02:12:20.314]  It's worse off.
[02:12:20.374 --> 02:12:22.576]  It was better off under Saddam Hussein than it is now.
[02:12:22.896 --> 02:12:24.277]  Hundreds of times better.
[02:12:24.557 --> 02:12:24.817]  Yeah.
[02:12:25.953 --> 02:12:27.534]  You know, these people aren't stupid.
[02:12:27.574 --> 02:12:36.777]  They realize that if the United States and Israel does this, that their lives will be infinitely worse than they would have been under the mullahs.
[02:12:36.797 --> 02:12:38.198]  So they're going to fight back.
[02:12:38.278 --> 02:12:46.221]  And anytime anybody invades a country, regardless of who's running the country at the time, the people rally together and defend against the
[02:12:47.099 --> 02:12:48.980]  The person who's attacking their country.
[02:12:49.540 --> 02:12:50.901]  It's human nature to do that.
[02:12:51.081 --> 02:12:51.781]  Hey, the U.S.
[02:12:51.841 --> 02:12:57.304]  is under attack by illegal immigration by Bush and Hillary and the rest of them and 90% are against it.
[02:12:57.324 --> 02:12:58.584]  The people have rallied there.
[02:12:59.005 --> 02:12:59.225]  Right.
[02:12:59.565 --> 02:13:00.065]  Precisely.
[02:13:00.165 --> 02:13:07.549]  And that's not an overt thing where there's... Imagine foreign troops for three plus years on your streets randomly shooting people, bombs going off.
[02:13:08.049 --> 02:13:10.410]  Our government clearly behind a lot of it to keep it stirred up.
[02:13:10.470 --> 02:13:11.110]  Some of it's real.
[02:13:12.171 --> 02:13:15.993]  Twelve, thirteen years of sanctions and intermittent bombing before that.
[02:13:17.160 --> 02:13:22.265]  Uh, birth defects quadrupling, uh, your water treatment plants all bombed, not allowed to repair them.
[02:13:22.785 --> 02:13:23.926]  I mean, this is hell on earth!
[02:13:24.186 --> 02:13:30.812]  Right, and you know, there's documentation out there to prove that that's precisely what Bush Sr.'
[02:13:30.792 --> 02:13:31.773]  's Pentagon did.
[02:13:32.313 --> 02:13:38.795]  Deliberately target those water treatment plants and break the sewage and the, you know, the electropower.
[02:13:38.915 --> 02:13:40.615]  Yeah, they blew up the infrastructure.
[02:13:40.635 --> 02:13:44.477]  Hey folks, try not having power or having sewage for 13 years.
[02:13:44.697 --> 02:13:45.217]  Yeah, right.
[02:13:45.277 --> 02:13:46.597]  And the Iranians know this.
[02:13:46.657 --> 02:13:47.577]  They live right next door.
[02:13:47.617 --> 02:13:49.058]  They know this is what's going to happen.
[02:13:49.458 --> 02:13:53.139]  So they're going to do whatever they need to do to stop it or fight back.
[02:13:54.359 --> 02:14:09.712]  What they'll also do is, Cheney will say, we may nuke you, Cheney will say we're going to cause you great harm and suffering, and then the Iranian President, Abedinejad, will say, okay, and he will repeat the exact same thing back.
[02:14:09.752 --> 02:14:13.375]  In fact, he'll say, here's the full quote, I'm paraphrasing it, I think this is exact,
[02:14:14.740 --> 02:14:15.681]  We want to have peace.
[02:14:15.721 --> 02:14:16.883]  We want to live with you in peace.
[02:14:16.903 --> 02:14:18.384]  We simply want to be sovereign.
[02:14:18.444 --> 02:14:19.245]  We are peaceful.
[02:14:19.786 --> 02:14:26.092]  But if you, you say you will cause us great pain and suffering, if you attack us, you will be caused great pain and suffering.
[02:14:26.332 --> 02:14:26.853]  Headline!
[02:14:26.873 --> 02:14:30.577]  Ahmed Dinejad says he will cause us great pain and suffering.
[02:14:31.360 --> 02:14:31.600]  Right.
[02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:32.862]  And they don't even give the full quote.
[02:14:32.902 --> 02:14:34.103]  I mean, it's just on and on and on.
[02:14:34.463 --> 02:14:35.845]  Israel says, we will nuke you.
[02:14:35.905 --> 02:14:37.827]  He says, then we will drive you into the sea.
[02:14:38.508 --> 02:14:40.590]  Unprovoked, he says he'll drive them into the sea.
[02:14:40.630 --> 02:14:43.893]  I mean, every time I go pull the actual quote, and it's a lie.
[02:14:44.274 --> 02:14:45.415]  Yeah, most assuredly.
[02:14:45.495 --> 02:14:50.580]  And you know, it's going to be a Dunkirk for our soldiers in Iraq if we do this.
[02:14:50.721 --> 02:14:51.762]  They're going to be trapped there.
[02:14:52.342 --> 02:14:55.345]  That's the plan.
[02:14:55.385 --> 02:14:57.347]  They sucked Hitler in, let him think he was winning.
[02:14:57.668 --> 02:14:58.569]  We can't be lost.
[02:14:58.609 --> 02:14:59.850]  We've been repulsed in Iraq.
[02:14:59.870 --> 02:15:01.091]  We're tied down in the bases.
[02:15:01.371 --> 02:15:02.673]  We've got to have a draft to beat them.
[02:15:02.693 --> 02:15:03.574]  And we'll go in and beat them.
[02:15:03.854 --> 02:15:04.635]  Yep, exactly.
[02:15:04.675 --> 02:15:06.417]  That's precisely how the neocons think.
[02:15:06.877 --> 02:15:08.178]  And they think we're a bunch of wimps.
[02:15:08.399 --> 02:15:14.425]  That we don't have the intestinal fortitude and the stomach to put up with this forever war that they have planned for us.
[02:15:14.833 --> 02:15:23.923]  So I think what they want to do is get us in a situation where we have no choice but to do that, but to respond, to have a draft, to further militarize our society.
[02:15:24.544 --> 02:15:36.057]  And that works into the New World Order just as well, because, you know, we declare martial law, get rid of the troublemakers like you and me, and, you know, just make this, you know, push forward the NEOCON plan.
[02:15:37.785 --> 02:15:38.865]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:15:39.466 --> 02:15:45.187]  And by the way, just in your blog, when I said that was wild, I meant that whole exchange was wild.
[02:15:45.347 --> 02:15:47.988]  That's something I say a lot, like, wow, that was wild.
[02:15:49.749 --> 02:15:51.889]  You know I'm not for Lord Corsi.
[02:15:52.209 --> 02:15:52.890]  No, I know you're not.
[02:15:53.570 --> 02:15:57.531]  But I also realize that the focus of the argument was on the American Union.
[02:15:58.215 --> 02:16:02.398]  And you didn't want to lose your guest, and you know, he got PO'd at me most assuredly.
[02:16:02.438 --> 02:16:05.961]  You could tell by the way he was... And he almost hung up, and he thought it was all a set-up.
[02:16:06.521 --> 02:16:07.202]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:16:07.302 --> 02:16:12.625]  Well, you know, obviously people call in, and they're going to say what they want to say, and you know, he was totally on it.
[02:16:12.645 --> 02:16:14.607]  It wasn't an ad hominem attack on my part.
[02:16:14.967 --> 02:16:15.908]  It was totally on topic.
[02:16:15.948 --> 02:16:24.094]  It was totally in regard to what he has said in the past about Muslims, and like I said before, I don't think a leopard changes its spots.
[02:16:25.034 --> 02:16:26.015]  I think he still believes that.
[02:16:26.664 --> 02:16:37.427]  He said that under, you know, he was anonymous on that form, and his screen name, you know, he was outed, and he had no choice but to backtrack on that.
[02:16:39.688 --> 02:16:45.590]  Well, what type of doctor, what type of older man is on message boards saying childish things?
[02:16:46.290 --> 02:16:53.392]  Well, obviously, that's what he is, and he has strong feelings about Islam, and that's like Daniel Pipes and the rest of them.
[02:16:53.976 --> 02:16:56.738]  They're Islamophobic.
[02:16:56.758 --> 02:16:57.719]  They don't like Muslims.
[02:16:58.499 --> 02:17:04.863]  A lot of them are neocons and Zionists and they just don't like them and they want to get rid of them.
[02:17:05.144 --> 02:17:08.306]  Regardless, there are a billion, one hundred million Muslims.
[02:17:08.786 --> 02:17:09.867]  We can't kill them all.
[02:17:09.967 --> 02:17:10.807]  It's not going to happen.
[02:17:10.827 --> 02:17:12.248]  The globalists are behind it all.
[02:17:12.548 --> 02:17:13.949]  They want us to have a big war with them.
[02:17:14.250 --> 02:17:19.613]  And out of this conflict of civilizations, they say they're going to have their New World Order come out of the ashes.
[02:17:20.033 --> 02:17:21.995]  Folks, the Bilderberg crowd
[02:17:22.395 --> 02:17:24.758]  Because World War I and World War II, this is what they do.
[02:17:24.798 --> 02:17:25.899]  They set up big wars.
[02:17:26.299 --> 02:17:27.601]  They finance both sides.
[02:17:27.661 --> 02:17:28.642]  They pick up the pieces.
[02:17:29.002 --> 02:17:30.904]  We don't want to do this.
[02:17:31.565 --> 02:17:33.467]  Kurt Nemo, I appreciate you joining us.

[02:21:37.008 --> 02:21:40.349]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:21:49.944 --> 02:21:52.265]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:21:52.285 --> 02:21:59.729]  All right, let's go to the calls now.
[02:22:00.089 --> 02:22:02.470]  Mike was trying to finish up before Curt Nemo got on for the segment.
[02:22:02.490 --> 02:22:03.871]  I wanted him to have a chance.
[02:22:04.672 --> 02:22:05.312]  Go ahead, Mike.
[02:22:06.297 --> 02:22:16.682]  Yeah, I was asking if you had believed that Lou Dobbs was a control valve, and your opinion was that just based on current action, probably not, and I tended to agree with you.
[02:22:16.702 --> 02:22:21.905]  Well, I think for the corporates he is a control valve, but I think he's genuine getting away with what he can.
[02:22:21.945 --> 02:22:23.986]  I mean, you can't fake that type of body language.
[02:22:24.446 --> 02:22:31.089]  Yeah, I agree with you, and aside from your show, I mean, I do look forward to listening to Dobbs.
[02:22:31.129 --> 02:22:34.791]  Last night he had one of the guys from this Republican who
[02:22:35.484 --> 02:22:38.007]  Switched his stance on immigration and he won the race.
[02:22:38.828 --> 02:22:43.353]  And yet when he came on, he was basically backtracking a little bit.
[02:22:43.393 --> 02:22:45.916]  He came up with a guest worker thing kind of hidden in there.
[02:22:46.237 --> 02:22:51.363]  And Lou kind of exposed that and stated the fact that, you know, Americans, we're not a commodity.
[02:22:51.403 --> 02:22:52.144]  We're citizens.
[02:22:52.204 --> 02:22:53.145]  This is our country.
[02:22:53.605 --> 02:22:55.708]  We own this country and you are our servants.
[02:22:56.360 --> 02:22:57.261]  So that's pretty strong.
[02:22:57.321 --> 02:22:58.722]  That's unprecedented.
[02:22:58.762 --> 02:22:59.542]  That's a big no-no.
[02:22:59.882 --> 02:23:02.704]  You are servants government, not officials, not authorities.
[02:23:03.004 --> 02:23:03.725]  Thanks for the call.
[02:23:04.165 --> 02:23:05.606]  See how they change the language.
[02:23:05.826 --> 02:23:06.467]  That's key.
[02:23:07.427 --> 02:23:09.468]  Let's talk to Russell in Florida.
[02:23:09.508 --> 02:23:10.449]  Russell, thanks for holding.
[02:23:10.929 --> 02:23:11.430]  Hey Alex.
[02:23:12.030 --> 02:23:12.330]  Hi.
[02:23:12.550 --> 02:23:19.335]  My call always gets messed up because as I sit here and wait, there's so many great topics brought up, my mind gets jumbled.
[02:23:21.033 --> 02:23:26.178]  That call earlier regarding Kennedy was fantastic and I hope you can get that posted.
[02:23:26.558 --> 02:23:37.710]  That reminds me of the famous quote from his Columbia speech where he said the high office of the president has been used to foment a plot to destroy American freedom and before I leave office I must inform the citizen of his plight.
[02:23:38.170 --> 02:23:39.672]  That's right, it's Columbian University.
[02:23:39.712 --> 02:23:40.232]  What was that?
[02:23:40.553 --> 02:23:41.714]  Three weeks before he was killed?
[02:23:41.734 --> 02:23:42.194]  Ten days.
[02:23:43.413 --> 02:23:43.773]  Ten days.
[02:23:43.813 --> 02:23:44.694]  Can you confirm that?
[02:23:44.754 --> 02:23:46.295]  I mean, is that true?
[02:23:46.435 --> 02:23:47.115]  No, no, no.
[02:23:47.215 --> 02:23:48.396]  I've gone and looked that quote up.
[02:23:48.456 --> 02:23:56.680]  That's on Kennedy... You know, these presidents all have... The first presidential library was LBJ after him, but he has the Kennedy Center and other places that keep his documents.
[02:23:56.720 --> 02:23:57.601]  No, he really did say that.
[02:23:58.461 --> 02:23:59.142]  Okay.
[02:23:59.222 --> 02:24:02.103]  I've confirmed... But you just heard him earlier saying similar things.
[02:24:02.363 --> 02:24:03.564]  Oh, that was incredible.
[02:24:03.604 --> 02:24:05.025]  I can't wait until you can get it posted.
[02:24:05.883 --> 02:24:13.670]  The reason originally for my call was I sent you an email earlier regarding this show that featured on Sci-Fi Channel last night called Countdown to Doomsday.
[02:24:13.690 --> 02:24:17.032]  I don't know if you heard anything about it, but Matt Lauer hosted it.
[02:24:17.092 --> 02:24:21.476]  It's on the Sci-Fi Channel and it's going to re-air the 25th, which is during your conference.
[02:24:22.097 --> 02:24:24.939]  So maybe if you can write a note down you can record that.
[02:24:25.479 --> 02:24:27.721]  But it was so Malthusian, Alex.
[02:24:28.362 --> 02:24:32.385]  They had 10 scenarios for total extinction of the population.
[02:24:32.926 --> 02:24:34.547]  And of course they blamed globalism.
[02:24:34.963 --> 02:24:38.044]  But their solutions always involved more globalism and more control.
[02:24:38.784 --> 02:24:40.564]  And it was very Malthusian in nature.
[02:24:40.604 --> 02:24:44.245]  There's all sorts of shows where you're all going to die unless global government saves you.
[02:24:45.385 --> 02:24:45.606]  Yeah.
[02:24:45.886 --> 02:24:47.626]  Can you comment a little bit about that?
[02:24:47.726 --> 02:24:49.226]  I mean, why they're doing this?
[02:24:49.366 --> 02:24:51.147]  I know it's a control mechanism.
[02:24:51.187 --> 02:24:56.148]  Well, I mean, the excuse that we're going to kill everybody to save the Earth is the perfect pretext to feel good about themselves.
[02:24:56.812 --> 02:24:57.653]  You know, we're not bad.
[02:24:57.673 --> 02:24:59.154]  We're doing this to keep you safe.
[02:24:59.354 --> 02:24:59.854]  We have to.
[02:25:00.054 --> 02:25:03.717]  But the solutions are always based on the Hegelian dialectic, what they want.
[02:25:03.797 --> 02:25:05.418]  And they're the very ones destroying the Earth.
[02:25:05.478 --> 02:25:06.719]  It's not the huge population.
[02:25:06.739 --> 02:25:07.859]  That's a very small factor.
[02:25:08.220 --> 02:25:10.981]  Once a country industrializes, you see a negative population.
[02:25:11.582 --> 02:25:20.848]  Yeah, they commented on that, that mass population was rising, and that the natural resources would not be able to handle the rising populations.
[02:25:20.908 --> 02:25:25.531]  And in the meantime, 20% of the species on Earth is becoming extinct, and they figure
[02:25:25.953 --> 02:25:28.855]  Between 20 and 40 percent in 30 years will be extinct.
[02:25:28.895 --> 02:25:29.915]  Which isn't really true.
[02:25:29.995 --> 02:25:33.657]  Most of these quote extinctions, a year later they find out they weren't extinct.
[02:25:34.118 --> 02:25:39.340]  You do have destruction of habitat and numbers going down and some species have been extinct.
[02:25:40.401 --> 02:25:44.523]  But what happens is they just send out some field examiners into a region.
[02:25:44.923 --> 02:25:46.704]  They sit there for two weeks looking for something.
[02:25:46.724 --> 02:25:49.006]  They don't find the gible toad or whatever.
[02:25:49.026 --> 02:25:50.186]  I'm making that up.
[02:25:50.266 --> 02:25:51.487]  And then, oh, it's extinct.
[02:25:51.867 --> 02:25:54.068]  It's like they say there's no red wolves in Texas.
[02:25:54.109 --> 02:25:54.849]  I've seen them twice.
[02:25:55.229 --> 02:25:56.950]  They said there's no mountain lions in Texas.
[02:25:57.010 --> 02:25:59.552]  I've seen them three times with my own eyeballs.
[02:26:00.052 --> 02:26:01.573]  I mean, they're just constantly doing this.
[02:26:01.673 --> 02:26:02.493]  It's just not true.
[02:26:03.194 --> 02:26:08.256]  You've gone over this stuff before, but perhaps you can watch it and comment on it later.
[02:26:08.577 --> 02:26:11.698]  It was very, very, very alarming and very disturbing.
[02:26:11.918 --> 02:26:13.139]  Well, give me a finger.
[02:26:13.199 --> 02:26:13.839]  Tape it for me.
[02:26:13.859 --> 02:26:14.360]  Mail it to me.
[02:26:14.520 --> 02:26:14.820]  I will.
[02:26:15.120 --> 02:26:23.765]  And I've got that DVD with Bowman in it called Voices of Patriots and the permission letter from the people for you to post it on all
[02:26:24.304 --> 02:26:24.984]  All your websites.
[02:26:25.024 --> 02:26:26.745]  Probably what I'll do is I'll give it to you at the conference.
[02:26:26.765 --> 02:26:27.326]  I'll see you there.
[02:26:27.566 --> 02:26:27.986]  Oh good!
[02:26:28.046 --> 02:26:28.866]  Can't wait to meet you.
[02:26:28.926 --> 02:26:29.127]  Alright.
[02:26:29.147 --> 02:26:29.807]  God bless you Alex.
[02:26:29.867 --> 02:26:30.787]  Take care my friend.
[02:26:30.847 --> 02:26:31.228]  Yeah.
[02:26:32.468 --> 02:26:33.469]  We're going to break and come back.
[02:26:33.969 --> 02:26:39.832]  And I'm going to make myself, because I love taking your calls, get into this disgusting article from Ottawa Express newspaper.
[02:26:39.852 --> 02:26:42.754]  This is off their website.
[02:26:43.254 --> 02:26:44.795]  What's so bad about Bilderberg?
[02:26:45.055 --> 02:26:47.496]  And I thought it was tongue-in-cheek, but it's not.
[02:26:48.437 --> 02:26:49.737]  It's ridiculous.
[02:26:50.438 --> 02:26:52.419]  And then we did get that article that the caller mentioned
[02:26:53.502 --> 02:26:55.865]  Tucson police turn up heat for summer weapon seizure.
[02:26:55.885 --> 02:27:00.471]  They say they're getting ready for something in October when they think the criminals will strike.
[02:27:00.511 --> 02:27:01.592]  Well, what does that mean?
[02:27:01.632 --> 02:27:03.274]  We keep hearing that month, October, October.
[02:27:03.775 --> 02:27:05.177]  I'm not saying anything's going to happen.
[02:27:05.197 --> 02:27:06.318]  The government sets deadlines.
[02:27:06.959 --> 02:27:08.101]  Doesn't mean anything's going to happen.
[02:27:09.062 --> 02:27:12.106]  But we'll get into at least these two articles and, well, I want to talk about Spider-Man, too.
[02:27:13.139 --> 02:27:22.126]  Yes, the comic books are now pro-Homeland Security and Spider-Man had to report himself and be tracked by the NSA and everyone must be tracked and controlled because Homeland Security is keeping us safe.
[02:27:22.166 --> 02:27:28.170]  I mean, this is... just everything is basted, marinated, submerged in propaganda.
[02:27:28.250 --> 02:27:29.071]  It's everywhere.
[02:27:29.151 --> 02:27:29.851]  Be aware of it!
[02:27:30.432 --> 02:27:30.952]  Be aware of it.
[02:27:33.874 --> 02:27:34.795]  We're on the march.
[02:27:35.255 --> 02:27:36.896]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:37.797 --> 02:27:40.459]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:43.652 --> 02:27:47.714]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:27:47.914 --> 02:27:51.315]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:27:51.495 --> 02:27:54.937]  Here's Dr. Maxson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:27:55.225 --> 02:27:58.488]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:27:58.508 --> 02:28:03.972]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[02:28:04.012 --> 02:28:11.097]  When we do our program, you know, in herpal form it's like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jobs.
[02:28:11.117 --> 02:28:13.639]  A few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:28:13.760 --> 02:28:15.121]  It's a well thought out formula.
[02:28:15.141 --> 02:28:20.545]  I mean, the idea of working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:28:21.045 --> 02:28:25.486]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:28:25.566 --> 02:28:26.927]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:28:27.087 --> 02:28:30.968]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[02:28:31.068 --> 02:28:33.069]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[02:28:43.890 --> 02:28:47.452]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[02:28:47.492 --> 02:28:48.012]  are located?
[02:28:48.213 --> 02:28:51.594]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[02:28:51.835 --> 02:28:56.537]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[02:28:56.817 --> 02:29:01.820]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[02:29:02.060 --> 02:29:02.661]  We're good to go.
[02:29:21.561 --> 02:29:21.781]  I think so.
[02:29:43.707 --> 02:29:48.110]  Local folklore has recognized its amazing medicinal properties for thousands of years.
[02:29:48.310 --> 02:29:53.974]  But no one knew just how to preserve the nutritional benefits and market the total fruit commercially until Zango, that is.
[02:29:54.334 --> 02:29:59.258]  Zango is made from mangosteen, a fruit that grows in the subtropical climates of Southeast Asia.
[02:29:59.498 --> 02:30:04.001]  It contains xanthomes, the highest concentration of antioxidants found in nature.
[02:30:04.281 --> 02:30:10.587]  Modern science is only just beginning to unlock the many secrets of Xanthos and their far-reaching potential to improve our health.
[02:30:10.888 --> 02:30:12.429]  Xango is revolutionary.
[02:30:12.629 --> 02:30:22.639]  Not only has Xango taken the world by storm as an extremely potent functional health beverage, but Xango has become the most exciting and fastest growing home-based business opportunity ever.
[02:30:22.940 --> 02:30:25.082]  Life is short, and timing is everything.
[02:30:25.422 --> 02:30:27.024]  Unleash the power of Zango today!
[02:30:27.284 --> 02:30:28.606]  Find out more by calling 888-203-6633.
[02:30:28.626 --> 02:30:29.467]  That's 888-203-6633.
[02:30:29.567 --> 02:30:31.269]  Or visit www.MangosteenMarket.com.
[02:30:31.409 --> 02:30:32.730]  That's M-A-N-G-O-S-T-E-E-N Market.com.
[02:30:52.390 --> 02:30:55.633]  Now listen to this convoluted logic from the Ottawa Express.
[02:30:56.533 --> 02:30:57.374]  We'll go to your calls.
[02:30:58.475 --> 02:31:00.176]  What's so bad about Bilderberg?
[02:31:01.217 --> 02:31:02.497]  By Stuart True.
[02:31:02.518 --> 02:31:04.179]  I want to get Stuart True on.
[02:31:05.820 --> 02:31:09.022]  Bilderberg meeting or not, there was no way I was heading out
[02:31:12.397 --> 02:31:18.599]  to the hotel last weekend to scream at black limos about genetically modified crops in war with Iran.
[02:31:19.139 --> 02:31:23.260]  I don't care what they, Richard Perle, Frank McKenna, David Rockefeller, etc.
[02:31:23.640 --> 02:31:25.001]  talked about behind closed doors.
[02:31:25.181 --> 02:31:27.021]  I can live with that kind of secrecy.
[02:31:27.981 --> 02:31:28.802]  Oh, really?
[02:31:29.802 --> 02:31:40.605]  Despite best guesses from the right- and left-wing conspiracy theorists, there is only circumstantial evidence proving that these disgustingly wealthy Bilderbergs have any influence over government policies in any country.
[02:31:41.315 --> 02:31:44.637]  What do you mean a whole bunch of them were current government officials at the highest levels?
[02:31:45.497 --> 02:31:46.418]  EU Commissioner?
[02:31:48.079 --> 02:31:49.299]  Federal Reserve President?
[02:31:49.439 --> 02:31:50.440]  Not Chairman, President?
[02:31:51.360 --> 02:31:52.341]  What are you talking about?
[02:31:52.361 --> 02:31:54.982]  The major heads of all the oil companies?
[02:31:55.042 --> 02:31:56.263]  What are you talking about?
[02:31:57.263 --> 02:32:02.886]  The equally secretive North American Competitiveness Council, NACC on the other hand, has far too much power.
[02:32:05.529 --> 02:32:13.612]  This guy tries to convince us that he's telling us the truth and he's good and he's exposing this because he then talks about the North American Competitiveness Council.
[02:32:14.372 --> 02:32:18.193]  The Bilderberg Group released some of their own minutes three years ago to the BBC, sir.
[02:32:18.894 --> 02:32:21.354]  Type Bilderberg into Google.
[02:32:21.414 --> 02:32:29.137]  One of the top links is in the top ten is the BBC where they admit that Bilderberg released documents that they founded the EU, they pushed it, they did it.
[02:32:29.657 --> 02:32:31.378]  We've got their own minutes, their own documents.
[02:32:31.418 --> 02:32:32.098]  We've published them.
[02:32:32.785 --> 02:32:34.467]  Where they're setting up the American Union.
[02:32:34.507 --> 02:32:36.609]  Who do you think's behind these councils?
[02:32:36.989 --> 02:32:38.751]  Who do you think's behind these agreements?
[02:32:39.071 --> 02:32:40.452]  Who do you think vets these people?
[02:32:40.512 --> 02:32:41.553]  What are you talking about?
[02:32:43.175 --> 02:32:52.804]  The NACC came out of a well-publicized, but ultimately hush-hush conversation between Stephen Harper, George W. Bush, and Mexican President Vicente Fox in Cancun earlier this year.
[02:32:53.785 --> 02:32:55.887]  No, it was Paul Martin and them, but the year before.
[02:32:56.627 --> 02:32:59.888]  Those talks were part of the whole Three Amigos thing.
[02:33:00.188 --> 02:33:02.469]  They're calling it a Security and Prosperity Partnership.
[02:33:02.829 --> 02:33:04.050]  Hey, get it straight, bro.
[02:33:04.310 --> 02:33:05.250]  C.F.R.
[02:33:05.270 --> 02:33:05.931]  wrote that a year ago.
[02:33:06.851 --> 02:33:15.735]  Of North America, which in media and John Manley, Fairyland helps people and communities across borders freely and quickly while stopping terrorists in their trucks.
[02:33:18.136 --> 02:33:21.777]  What it does is create an American Union, Bubba, and get rid of our sovereignty.
[02:33:23.030 --> 02:33:28.078]  A different picture emerges when you leaf through the SPP's Prosperity Agenda at SPP.gov.
[02:33:28.479 --> 02:33:32.425]  It turns out people actually mean business, persons from the North America.
[02:33:32.465 --> 02:33:36.913]  The rest of us are human capital to be developed in line with continental corporate imperatives.
[02:33:37.768 --> 02:33:38.268]  It goes on.
[02:33:38.688 --> 02:33:50.751]  Also annoying is the part about regulatory cooperation, which means both eliminating redundant testing and certification requirements on all goods, including food and drugs, and avoiding new regulation altogether.
[02:33:50.811 --> 02:33:58.313]  Biotech companies are big on the idea because it means they can test new foods, quote, in the market rather than proving their safer consumption beforehand.
[02:33:59.810 --> 02:34:09.892]  New to the agenda this year was the aforementioned North American Competitiveness Council, created amazingly to increase private sector engagement in the SPP by adding high-level business input.
[02:34:11.032 --> 02:34:22.755]  The Canadian Council of the Chief Executives, who basically wrote the entire SPP on their own, called the new council an important step towards enhancing the competitive position of North American industrial industries in the global marketplace.
[02:34:23.450 --> 02:34:30.233]  The goal is to complete with economic heavyweights India and China, neither of which is known, for its strident labor and environmental laws.
[02:34:30.453 --> 02:34:31.573]  Yeah, they're slaves in China.
[02:34:32.173 --> 02:34:39.757]  We can compete, says the CCCCE, by dramatically reducing corporate and income taxes.
[02:34:39.777 --> 02:34:47.059]  Not discussed is the resulting lack of funding for benefits, like public health care, which recently lured Toyota to Ontario, despite several U.S.
[02:34:47.099 --> 02:34:50.221]  promises, the company hundreds of millions in incentives.
[02:34:50.241 --> 02:34:50.981]  Let me just stop there.
[02:34:52.193 --> 02:34:54.816]  You hear Neil Bortz and others pushing a national sales tax.
[02:34:54.856 --> 02:34:58.299]  The official plan is to keep the income tax but call it a social security tax.
[02:34:58.319 --> 02:35:03.564]  So, number one, you're going to have a 23-25 percent sales tax on top of your other taxes.
[02:35:03.584 --> 02:35:04.826]  They're not going to get rid of one of them.
[02:35:05.446 --> 02:35:10.752]  And these global corporations are actually lobbying for it because they're offshore and won't pay any of it to begin with.
[02:35:10.832 --> 02:35:11.152]  Okay?
[02:35:11.853 --> 02:35:13.154]  I'm really getting sick of it.
[02:35:15.816 --> 02:35:17.317]  They go, oh, you just want the rich people.
[02:35:17.537 --> 02:35:19.858]  You're just afraid of, you're just jealous of money.
[02:35:19.958 --> 02:35:21.498]  No, folks, I don't like high taxes.
[02:35:21.538 --> 02:35:22.979]  I don't believe in the tax system we have.
[02:35:24.159 --> 02:35:26.160]  I believe in a very limited constitutional republic.
[02:35:27.060 --> 02:35:29.661]  I believe in the 2-3% tax we have when this country was founded.
[02:35:30.142 --> 02:35:30.902]  Unlimited things.
[02:35:31.602 --> 02:35:33.943]  And I actually believe in a small regional sales tax.
[02:35:33.983 --> 02:35:35.084]  No federal sales tax, folks.
[02:35:36.304 --> 02:35:37.364]  This is a nightmare.
[02:35:37.985 --> 02:35:38.645]  Again, I digress.
[02:35:42.777 --> 02:35:54.682]  So this guy basically says we're bad, saying Bilderberg is powerful, but that these other little boards that are doing their bidding are bad.
[02:35:57.543 --> 02:36:18.033]  I can handle Bilderberg, but the SPP, most of the MPs don't even know the details, so the protesters who waited outside of the Brook Street Hotel last weekend wanting to catch a hateful glimpse of Henry Kissinger, why don't you stop stuffing express boxes with your hysterical posters and write Harper a bleeping letter or something?
[02:36:19.714 --> 02:36:20.534]  What are you talking about?
[02:36:20.554 --> 02:36:23.776]  We're going directly to the heads of it that are doing it.
[02:36:24.620 --> 02:36:26.140]  And you haven't seen any evidence of it.
[02:36:26.380 --> 02:36:29.921]  That'd be like if you've never been outside your house and you said, I see no evidence of a sun.
[02:36:30.621 --> 02:36:35.582]  Believe me, Bubba, you walk out in the street and look up at high noon, you're going to burn your eyeballs out looking at it.
[02:36:35.622 --> 02:36:37.383]  I've burned mine out looking at the New World Order.
[02:36:37.743 --> 02:36:39.203]  Believe me, brother, it's real.
[02:36:39.883 --> 02:36:40.863]  Okay, there is an elite.
[02:36:40.883 --> 02:36:41.663]  They're running things.
[02:36:44.064 --> 02:36:45.124]  Ridiculous article.
[02:36:46.504 --> 02:36:50.105]  It says a lot of truth, but then kind of pooh-poohs it at the end.
[02:36:51.469 --> 02:36:54.631]  This is out of KOLD News.
[02:36:54.851 --> 02:36:58.414]  We didn't find it in the Tucson Star.
[02:36:58.494 --> 02:37:03.377]  It says, Tucson Police turn up heat for summer weapons seizures.
[02:37:03.457 --> 02:37:07.220]  Summer means longer days, no school, and more opportunities for police to crack down on crime.
[02:37:08.360 --> 02:37:18.307]  We certainly have the ability to call upon more resources in the summer from some of the other assignments we have, although the call load never stops for sure, said Tucson Police Assistant Chief John Leavitt.
[02:37:19.173 --> 02:37:24.657]  It's time that Leavitt says Tucson Police can focus on felons who have guns and try to get ahead of the crime curve.
[02:37:25.157 --> 02:37:34.944]  Believe it or not, October is one of the busiest months and we think if we can get the guns out of the hands of the criminals this summer and early fall, hopefully October won't be as violent as a month as it's been in the past.
[02:37:35.025 --> 02:37:39.428]  So the caller talked about how on TV the guy said we're expecting really big things in October.
[02:37:39.808 --> 02:37:40.969]  This makes it a little bit more clear.
[02:37:41.883 --> 02:37:53.809]  TPD's Special Investigations Division puts illegal guns in its sights often with the help of federal grants from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and Explosives, all to prevent crime by people who have or seek such weapons.
[02:37:57.191 --> 02:37:59.211]  The BATF has been doubled in size.
[02:37:59.652 --> 02:38:01.172]  I'm told it's even got more funding now.
[02:38:01.813 --> 02:38:08.336]  As Bob Barr said, former congressman on the show, NRA board member, Bush is more anti-gun than Bill Clinton.
[02:38:09.136 --> 02:38:11.098]  The Second Amendment is on fire right now.
[02:38:11.158 --> 02:38:12.099]  It's burning down.
[02:38:12.500 --> 02:38:17.405]  The average conservative is literally sucking her thumb in a catatonic state worshiping George Bush.
[02:38:17.946 --> 02:38:19.508]  You people are a joke, okay?
[02:38:21.330 --> 02:38:26.135]  The Deputy Police Chief says, to give you an example of the operation recently, we were able to work with ATF
[02:38:27.819 --> 02:38:32.342]  We were able to meet with people who wanted to buy 26 machine guns and 30 hand grenades, Levitt said.
[02:38:32.682 --> 02:38:36.444]  There's no question those machine guns and hand grenades were going to be used for violence.
[02:38:36.504 --> 02:38:39.706]  Every indication was that they were going to be used in violence in Mexico.
[02:38:40.146 --> 02:38:44.569]  But the fact that people come to Tucson to look for machine guns and hand grenades, we want to make sure we...
[02:38:46.303 --> 02:38:47.043]  Discourage that.
[02:38:47.464 --> 02:38:48.304]  Oh, why didn't you bust them?
[02:38:48.324 --> 02:38:50.646]  Because they were probably Los Zetas government terrorists.
[02:38:50.946 --> 02:38:52.707]  The ones that shoot across the border every day.
[02:38:52.967 --> 02:38:54.908]  The ones that kill Border Patrol and FBI.
[02:38:55.108 --> 02:38:56.169]  The ones that kill citizens.
[02:38:56.669 --> 02:38:59.751]  The ones that kidnapped 54 Americans last year out of Texas.
[02:39:00.051 --> 02:39:02.473]  Took them down there to Mexico and it was barely on the news.
[02:39:02.833 --> 02:39:03.933]  Mass kidnappings!
[02:39:04.674 --> 02:39:07.516]  Rocket attacks!
[02:39:07.536 --> 02:39:08.516]  So what does that mean?
[02:39:09.377 --> 02:39:14.760]  The focus on getting guns off the street is the first five months of this year's TPD South Division and it just goes on.
[02:39:17.028 --> 02:39:18.208]  They call it an offensive.
[02:39:19.889 --> 02:39:20.649]  Oh, this is sick.
[02:39:21.069 --> 02:39:23.950]  They hope to get more federal grants to increase their activities.
[02:39:23.990 --> 02:39:25.490]  Federalization, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:39:25.950 --> 02:39:27.211]  Federalization of your police.
[02:39:28.711 --> 02:39:31.712]  Let's go ahead and talk to... Who's up first here?
[02:39:33.992 --> 02:39:35.413]  Cliff in Idaho, you're on the air.
[02:39:35.433 --> 02:39:37.433]  Yeah, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[02:39:37.633 --> 02:39:42.274]  I got two quick comments and then I got an important message for your listeners.
[02:39:43.135 --> 02:39:43.815]  First one is,
[02:39:44.767 --> 02:39:52.571]  I got a lot of respect for you for your bravery and your fortitude and stuff for carrying on with this fight against the new world order.
[02:39:52.591 --> 02:39:56.232]  Because I'll tell you what, you put your life in a lot of jeopardy just like I've done before.
[02:39:57.333 --> 02:40:02.215]  And then second, I'd like to ask you, what did you do with that quarter your dad gave you for singing lessons?
[02:40:03.656 --> 02:40:07.678]  That was a joke when I sang the Spider-Man song, yeah.
[02:40:07.938 --> 02:40:08.458]  Yeah, I know.
[02:40:08.538 --> 02:40:12.640]  Anyhow, what I want to do is, if you don't mind, you had a guy on talking about the SPP.
[02:40:13.999 --> 02:40:19.463]  And what I want to do is I want to urge all your listeners, here and overseas, to get on that website.
[02:40:19.483 --> 02:40:20.484]  Do you mind if I give it out?
[02:40:20.824 --> 02:40:21.045]  Sure!
[02:40:21.745 --> 02:40:25.788]  The website is www.spp.
[02:40:26.349 --> 02:40:28.290]  That's Sam and Paul.
[02:40:28.911 --> 02:40:30.732]  S-P-P.
[02:40:30.752 --> 02:40:33.274]  And go through all, there's more than 20 of them on there.
[02:40:33.374 --> 02:40:34.395]  It's .org, isn't it?
[02:40:34.655 --> 02:40:35.876]  You'll want to give them the last part.
[02:40:36.277 --> 02:40:37.077]  No, it's .com.
[02:40:37.978 --> 02:40:40.200]  Okay, well you didn't give that out, so.
[02:40:41.209 --> 02:40:44.062]  But anyhow, don't just go on one or two of them.
[02:40:44.122 --> 02:40:45.850]  Go through all of them like I did and you're going to...
[02:40:46.257 --> 02:40:49.539]  You're going to find out what this country is coming to and what the United States will be here.
[02:40:49.619 --> 02:40:50.979]  The total end of America!
[02:40:51.019 --> 02:40:55.721]  They're building the highways that are used as the taxing grids to pay to bust out the border even worse.
[02:40:56.062 --> 02:40:57.542]  Not only that, they're changing the laws.
[02:40:57.562 --> 02:40:59.923]  They're going to have a little national police force in here, too.
[02:41:00.023 --> 02:41:00.284]  I know!
[02:41:00.584 --> 02:41:01.764]  International!
[02:41:01.884 --> 02:41:05.046]  Mexico, Canada, U.S., their police, their military will be here.
[02:41:05.366 --> 02:41:06.807]  That deal was signed three years ago.
[02:41:06.827 --> 02:41:08.908]  We'll all have a regional ID card.
[02:41:09.228 --> 02:41:10.348]  That's exactly right.
[02:41:10.408 --> 02:41:12.409]  And thank you for the good work and God bless you, Alex.
[02:41:12.489 --> 02:41:13.090]  Oh, by the way,
[02:41:14.560 --> 02:41:22.783]  One of my relations, my great great great granddaddy, signed the Declaration of Independence and I think it's in the genes like you and I. I appreciate your call.
[02:41:23.144 --> 02:41:24.804]  Let's go ahead and take another one here.
[02:41:24.824 --> 02:41:27.385]  I guess Matt is up next.
[02:41:27.445 --> 02:41:28.866]  Matt, where are you calling us from?
[02:41:29.046 --> 02:41:30.367]  I'm calling from Blacksburg, Virginia.
[02:41:30.567 --> 02:41:30.907]  Welcome.
[02:41:31.507 --> 02:41:38.390]  Yeah, I wanted to let you know about a little drill I saw on the local campus of the ROTC doing that's right up your alley.
[02:41:39.451 --> 02:41:42.872]  They took over a small street that is adjacent to campus
[02:41:43.396 --> 02:41:44.717]  Not much traffic on the street.
[02:41:45.377 --> 02:41:53.663]  This happened after dark and they lined up several of their cars each with an ROTC camos driving each car.
[02:41:54.244 --> 02:42:10.395]  Within about 20 minutes later I noticed that there come about five or six guys in camos but with white t-shirts on and book bags and each one of them had a ROTC guy behind them poking them with clubs in the book bags telling them
[02:42:11.249 --> 02:42:12.870]  March along, march along.
[02:42:12.930 --> 02:42:21.953]  Sir, we've had ROTC officers on from San Antonio who come on and say their full name and it's in the news.
[02:42:22.013 --> 02:42:27.415]  They've been training for years for gun confiscation or fighting the militia, dealing with American terrorists.
[02:42:27.535 --> 02:42:28.396]  That's what they do now.
[02:42:28.816 --> 02:42:39.280]  Yeah, they were literally, the guys in the white t-shirts were saying, we're students, we're Americans and the other guys were hitting them with the batons in the backpacks and loaded them up in the cars and drove off.
[02:42:40.293 --> 02:42:42.394]  Yeah, they're training them little goons.
[02:42:42.494 --> 02:42:49.137]  It'll be ROTC with police, rushing in with real machine guns, grabbing people who've spoken out, dragging them to the FEMA camp.
[02:42:49.457 --> 02:42:52.619]  Well, supposedly they do this in a different location each semester.
[02:42:53.119 --> 02:42:55.940]  I think I have a good up and up on where they're going to do it this fall.
[02:42:55.960 --> 02:42:59.202]  I'm going to try and videotape and interview these guys and get you a copy.
[02:43:00.182 --> 02:43:01.242]  What university is that?
[02:43:01.383 --> 02:43:02.323]  This is Virginia Tech.
[02:43:04.787 --> 02:43:05.687]  Virginia Tech.
[02:43:05.707 --> 02:43:06.388]  Kevin, you hear that?
[02:43:06.428 --> 02:43:08.568]  Let's get the ROTC on from Virginia Tech.
[02:43:08.768 --> 02:43:14.390]  You should, because it was one of the scariest things I've seen, and the white t-shirt thing just was creepy.
[02:43:16.171 --> 02:43:23.013]  Well, I mean, that's actually what role players... I've been to official Marine Corps drills, where I'm an American police, no, not the camp.
[02:43:23.033 --> 02:43:24.334]  They practice taking your kids away.
[02:43:24.374 --> 02:43:25.474]  They practice taking your guns.
[02:43:26.167 --> 02:43:29.308]  This is their pride and joy to use the military against us.
[02:43:29.688 --> 02:43:30.408]  Big wake-up call.
[02:43:30.428 --> 02:43:31.508]  Thanks for everything, Alex.
[02:43:31.568 --> 02:43:32.869]  I really appreciate your hard work.
[02:43:32.989 --> 02:43:33.409]  Thank you.
[02:43:33.469 --> 02:43:35.510]  I want to play a clip, then we'll go back to more calls.
[02:43:35.990 --> 02:43:37.590]  Bush and those pesky shades.
[02:43:38.950 --> 02:43:45.032]  Today, this is yesterday now, at a press exchange happened with Peter Walston of the Los Angeles Times.
[02:43:45.312 --> 02:43:48.893]  Bush, you going to ask your question with those shades on?
[02:43:49.013 --> 02:43:49.733]  Walston, yes.
[02:43:49.993 --> 02:43:52.134]  Bush, but there's no sun out here.
[02:43:52.894 --> 02:43:53.794]  It was somewhat sunny.
[02:43:54.114 --> 02:43:55.875]  Walston, it depends on your perspective.
[02:43:56.847 --> 02:43:58.007]  Uh, Bush, touche.
[02:43:58.128 --> 02:43:59.548]  Walston is legally blind.
[02:44:00.628 --> 02:44:06.470]  We kid the president, it doesn't look like the reporter minded, but it's just another day of bizarro Bush conferences.
[02:44:07.851 --> 02:44:19.134]  So, uh, the point of this is that, not that Bush intentionally taunted a blind man, but that his insistence on clowning with the press is undignified and highly bizarre.
[02:44:20.215 --> 02:44:21.555]  And I've seen him yell at people.
[02:44:22.247 --> 02:44:26.608]  Because they'll be busy shouting questions when he's about to leave and somebody will go, Sir, Sir, what about this?
[02:44:26.988 --> 02:44:29.168]  Hey, you addressed me as Mr. President!
[02:44:29.449 --> 02:44:36.390]  I mean, again, it's just, it's so arrogant, taking yourself so seriously.
[02:44:37.790 --> 02:44:43.852]  Because I see other Prime Ministers, other people in the press at first, Mr. President, Mr. President, but, I don't know, what about this?
[02:44:43.892 --> 02:44:46.672]  Well, you better address me as Prime Minister!
[02:44:49.573 --> 02:44:50.213]  It's amazing.
[02:44:51.118 --> 02:44:52.079]  Let's play that clip.
[02:44:52.119 --> 02:44:53.660]  Here's Bush to the blind man.
[02:44:54.821 --> 02:44:56.962]  Take your glasses off.
[02:44:57.002 --> 02:44:57.282]  Go ahead.
[02:44:58.623 --> 02:44:59.263]  It's their country.
[02:45:00.264 --> 02:45:03.646]  And the governor ought to reflect their traditions and their history.
[02:45:04.787 --> 02:45:10.791]  All we expect is people to be treated with respect and there to be self-governance in a way that tolerates differences of opinion.
[02:45:12.392 --> 02:45:14.173]  Peter, are you going to ask that question with those shades on?
[02:45:14.193 --> 02:45:17.415]  No, I'm interested in the shade look, seriously.
[02:45:17.475 --> 02:45:18.376]  Alright, I'll keep it then.
[02:45:18.616 --> 02:45:19.757]  For the viewers, there's no sun.
[02:45:21.448 --> 02:45:22.549]  It depends on your perspective.
[02:45:22.569 --> 02:45:25.610]  Okay.
[02:45:25.790 --> 02:45:26.290]  Touche.
[02:45:27.250 --> 02:45:29.932]  Following up on the other Peter's question about Karl Rove.
[02:45:31.132 --> 02:45:33.133]  So, Bush knows him.
[02:45:33.233 --> 02:45:35.774]  The guy's a part of the White House pool for years, I'm told.
[02:45:36.094 --> 02:45:39.556]  The guy's blind and Bush makes a joke about how he's wearing glasses.
[02:45:40.556 --> 02:45:43.957]  For those that don't know, a lot of folks that are blind, you know, they're not focused on something.
[02:45:43.977 --> 02:45:44.978]  They're not looking at something.
[02:45:45.718 --> 02:45:47.399]  And so their eyes go all over the place.
[02:45:48.141 --> 02:45:54.403]  And they know that it causes confusion in people because we cue off of body language, especially the eyes.
[02:45:55.423 --> 02:46:05.225]  And so, you know, I've been talking to nice visually impaired people, blind folks before, you know, they're not wearing glasses and their eyes are wandering all around and they do it to put everybody at ease.
[02:46:05.285 --> 02:46:07.106]  It doesn't really, I guess, put me off.
[02:46:07.146 --> 02:46:07.906]  It's just no big deal.
[02:46:07.946 --> 02:46:12.467]  But, you know, you always see the guy with the cane going down the street with the glasses on.
[02:46:12.527 --> 02:46:14.447]  I mean, they wear glasses, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:46:14.767 --> 02:46:15.668]  Bush knows this.
[02:46:16.228 --> 02:46:17.488]  He's just a total freak.
[02:46:18.194 --> 02:46:19.975]  He's a total and complete freak.
[02:46:21.355 --> 02:46:22.596]  Let's go ahead and make another call.
[02:46:23.636 --> 02:46:25.297]  Erin in California, you're on the air.
[02:46:25.777 --> 02:46:26.178]  Hi!
[02:46:26.818 --> 02:46:27.938]  I'm a big fan of yours, Alex.
[02:46:28.319 --> 02:46:31.700]  I showed four of your documentaries in my area for free to the public.
[02:46:31.720 --> 02:46:32.380]  Good!
[02:46:33.061 --> 02:46:39.584]  In doing so, I found out that a couple of my family members are, I guess, lifetime members of the Bohemian Grove.
[02:46:40.324 --> 02:46:44.866]  And I asked my cousin about it, and he said that, well I asked him about the
[02:46:45.390 --> 02:46:56.078]  There's a video that I saw about the cremation of Karen, the human effigy being sacrificed, and he said, quote, oh yeah, we sacrifice things there all the time, you know, like as if he's talking about going golfing or something.
[02:46:56.198 --> 02:46:57.780]  It was like Peter Jennings before he died.
[02:46:57.820 --> 02:47:00.442]  He goes, skull and bones, so they did worship Satan, big deal.
[02:47:01.002 --> 02:47:02.043]  I just, I couldn't believe it.
[02:47:02.243 --> 02:47:04.665]  I actually, I basically cut off that part of my family.
[02:47:04.745 --> 02:47:06.727]  Well, they must be pretty wealthy or pretty powerful.
[02:47:06.747 --> 02:47:07.447]  Yeah, I guess so.
[02:47:07.487 --> 02:47:10.750]  He's a lawyer, so I guess he's a NWO lawyer or something, I don't know.
[02:47:11.696 --> 02:47:13.517]  And so he said we sacrifice lots of things?
[02:47:13.837 --> 02:47:16.499]  Yeah, he said we sacrifice things there all the time.
[02:47:17.279 --> 02:47:21.862]  See, that's like John Yoo going, yeah, we torture children sexually, we're allowed to, we're the government.
[02:47:22.363 --> 02:47:23.663]  And it's just like, what?
[02:47:23.723 --> 02:47:24.964]  You just admit it?
[02:47:25.024 --> 02:47:25.604]  Exactly!
[02:47:25.945 --> 02:47:34.930]  And actually, right when I said that I think that that's satanic, he actually then went into denial and said, oh no, no, no, no, everything you saw was fake, that's not true.
[02:47:34.990 --> 02:47:39.593]  And I offered him the video to see for himself and he just said no, I don't want that.
[02:47:40.305 --> 02:47:40.565]  You know.
[02:47:41.366 --> 02:47:43.367]  Has he even heard that I infiltrated?
[02:47:43.887 --> 02:47:45.488]  Yeah, I guess, after I told him.
[02:47:45.548 --> 02:47:49.370]  I mean, he asked me how I found out, and I said, through Alex Jones, and I offered him your video.
[02:47:51.671 --> 02:47:55.193]  And I even gave a film screening, and nobody in my family showed up.
[02:47:55.233 --> 02:47:58.235]  I guess they just are too cowardly to want to know the truth.
[02:47:58.755 --> 02:48:01.596]  Well, we're a free country, but everybody knows you got on the list doing that.
[02:48:02.297 --> 02:48:04.138]  Oh, we're a free country, but I better not speak out.
[02:48:04.158 --> 02:48:04.658]  They're watching.
[02:48:05.279 --> 02:48:06.779]  Yeah, I'm definitely not afraid.
[02:48:06.799 --> 02:48:08.340]  Also, Alex, I had a quick question.
[02:48:08.880 --> 02:48:10.641]  I was wondering about the plan in San Diego.
[02:48:10.721 --> 02:48:12.081]  Who exactly is behind that?
[02:48:12.161 --> 02:48:16.582]  Is it just a small group, the Luricon Kisa, or is it the whole Mexican government?
[02:48:18.723 --> 02:48:20.303]  Let me answer that after the break.
[02:48:20.343 --> 02:48:21.764]  That's an important question.
[02:48:24.184 --> 02:48:27.545]  It was the Mexican government to a great extent in 1917 and then in 1942.
[02:48:31.608 --> 02:48:36.934]  And now it's been adopted by the head of Chicano Studies, University of Texas, openly says all whites must be killed.
[02:48:37.474 --> 02:48:38.075]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:43.456 --> 02:48:51.724]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[02:48:51.904 --> 02:48:54.247]  We're expecting around a thousand people in attendance.
[02:48:54.847 --> 02:49:03.696]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[02:49:04.216 --> 02:49:07.718]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda.
[02:49:08.178 --> 02:49:16.502]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lt.
[02:49:16.542 --> 02:49:16.843]  Col.
[02:49:17.083 --> 02:49:28.969]  Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Turnbull, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[02:49:29.289 --> 02:49:33.051]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.

[02:51:45.899 --> 02:51:51.941]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:51:52.541 --> 02:51:55.502]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:58.047 --> 02:52:05.334]  The plan of San Diego was executed during World War I. In one night alone, it was that 22 whites were killed, including small children in their homes.
[02:52:06.935 --> 02:52:10.778]  It was a genocidal program, kind of like the Hutus killing the Tutsis.
[02:52:11.059 --> 02:52:14.261]  It all backfired and caused a big massacre of Hispanics.
[02:52:14.282 --> 02:52:16.223]  A lot of whites created atrocities after that.
[02:52:17.444 --> 02:52:22.729]  And that was the start of some of the breakdowns between relations of Hispanics and whites in Texas.
[02:52:23.169 --> 02:52:24.851]  They still have a pretty good relationship in the past.
[02:52:25.592 --> 02:52:30.294]  A lot of the reconquistas from Mexico that came to California first are coming to Texas now, though.
[02:52:31.014 --> 02:52:36.016]  And it's just open America hating, open burn American flags, open America's going down.
[02:52:36.356 --> 02:52:37.697]  And they're all funded by our own government.
[02:52:37.737 --> 02:52:38.797]  It's part of the American Union.
[02:52:39.618 --> 02:52:41.459]  So, yes, it is.
[02:52:41.979 --> 02:52:49.602]  Well, now, you know, some of these professors and others who are leaders in the Chicano Studies movement, they're saying kill all whites, including all women.
[02:52:50.002 --> 02:52:50.842]  We all must die.
[02:52:51.263 --> 02:52:52.303]  It's really strange because
[02:52:52.873 --> 02:52:55.834]  Most Hispanics, I would guess, are about half white, sometimes even more.
[02:52:56.814 --> 02:52:59.675]  They're that Native American, Mesoamerican tribe mixture.
[02:53:00.155 --> 02:53:02.455]  They're Spanish, predominantly, but also German and English.
[02:53:02.836 --> 02:53:04.256]  So I guess, you know, kill themselves.
[02:53:04.436 --> 02:53:05.496]  It just makes no sense.
[02:53:05.556 --> 02:53:06.456]  It's just more craziness.
[02:53:07.557 --> 02:53:09.737]  Let's talk to John in Oregon.
[02:53:09.777 --> 02:53:10.477]  John, go ahead.
[02:53:11.218 --> 02:53:13.478]  Alex, it's a real pleasure to talk to you.
[02:53:13.798 --> 02:53:14.478]  Good to talk to you.
[02:53:15.919 --> 02:53:19.480]  I've got to say, like everybody else has told you, you're a real hero here.
[02:53:20.914 --> 02:53:28.635]  I'm a Vietnam-era vet, and I took an oath for the Constitution, and I plan on sticking it out with you as long as you do this.
[02:53:28.735 --> 02:53:29.695]  I'm going to be doing this.
[02:53:30.316 --> 02:53:31.336]  This is craziness.
[02:53:32.536 --> 02:53:33.656]  I have to tell you something.
[02:53:34.256 --> 02:53:43.738]  My lady friend used to do health care for veterans, and one of the guys she took care of, he died, and left her with some documents.
[02:53:45.358 --> 02:53:50.579]  When she brought these documents to me, they turned my world upside down.
[02:53:51.275 --> 02:53:55.577]  Um, evidently in this document it declares war on the American public.
[02:53:55.937 --> 02:53:57.218]  It's called the Quiet Wars.
[02:53:57.238 --> 02:53:58.018]  Have you ever heard of that?
[02:53:59.058 --> 02:53:59.359]  Yes.
[02:54:00.479 --> 02:54:16.566]  Well, um, this Quiet Wars supposedly fought with silent weapons and basically what they do is they go in and they just control everything right down to the family unit, um, how they're going to destroy dad, how they're going to destroy mom and the kids and, um,
[02:54:17.490 --> 02:54:22.256]  It's a plan that... Do they have other documents like silent weapons for quiet wars?
[02:54:22.916 --> 02:54:25.759]  It's quiet wars fought with silent weapons.
[02:54:25.779 --> 02:54:27.181]  Yeah, I was going from memory.
[02:54:27.221 --> 02:54:27.902]  I've read it.
[02:54:27.922 --> 02:54:29.964]  That's actually been in some mainstream news.
[02:54:30.605 --> 02:54:31.185]  Oh, it has?
[02:54:31.305 --> 02:54:33.888]  Okay, because it's been... I got it backwards memory.
[02:54:33.928 --> 02:54:35.770]  It's an economy war is what it is.
[02:54:35.850 --> 02:54:38.753]  And when I heard the neocons talking about World War 4,
[02:54:39.873 --> 02:54:44.596]  I said, well, okay, this is World War III, because they actually declare war on the American public.
[02:54:44.736 --> 02:54:57.425]  Oh, no, sir, sir, when Thomas Barnett gets up on C-SPAN for the Pentagon new map, he says they work for the New World Order, that America's going into a one-world government, and that, I mean, sir, it's a... Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:54:57.465 --> 02:54:58.166]  I'm sorry we're out of time.
[02:54:58.186 --> 02:54:59.647]  That's a really important point you raised.
[02:55:00.268 --> 02:55:01.689]  I'm sorry to the other callers.
[02:55:01.749 --> 02:55:02.670]  We're out of time.
[02:55:02.690 --> 02:55:03.771]  I don't have time to go to you.
[02:55:04.131 --> 02:55:08.074]  I'll be back tomorrow live and of course back on Monday and Tuesday when I go to L.A.
