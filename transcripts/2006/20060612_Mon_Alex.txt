[00:00:05.852 --> 00:00:06.513]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.175 --> 00:00:08.217]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:10.042]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.703 --> 00:00:11.505]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.287 --> 00:00:13.069]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.783]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.023 --> 00:00:22.086]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.871 --> 00:00:41.852]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:41.892 --> 00:00:46.495]  Thank you for joining us on this live Wednesday edition, the 7th day of June, 2006.
[00:00:47.055 --> 00:00:51.638]  We have Professor Stephen E. Jones.
[00:00:51.698 --> 00:00:55.621]  He's a physics professor, has a doctorate in physics, joining us.
[00:00:55.781 --> 00:00:58.063]  Huge new developments.
[00:00:58.103 --> 00:01:05.728]  They were able to get some of the samples of the support columns of the beams from Tower 1 and Tower 2.
[00:01:07.648 --> 00:01:16.153]  They were able to get samples from the point at which they had been mysteriously cut as if by a hot knife through butter.
[00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:24.257]  They have tested the substance and it has the byproducts that you would see precisely with thermite, but not just with thermite.
[00:01:25.298 --> 00:01:32.282]  The exact patented type of thermite that is specifically used for cutting large columns.
[00:01:35.115 --> 00:01:35.735]  Oh, yes.
[00:01:35.815 --> 00:01:40.799]  And then you're going to ask, where did they get these samples?
[00:01:43.942 --> 00:01:45.483]  All over the country.
[00:01:46.864 --> 00:01:48.466]  All over the nation.
[00:01:49.146 --> 00:01:57.353]  They have these little remembrance propaganda 9-11 sites that they use to sell the destruction of our freedoms and the birth of their world government.
[00:01:58.434 --> 00:02:00.736]  There's dozens and dozens of them across the country.
[00:02:01.236 --> 00:02:02.137]  There's some in Canada.
[00:02:02.157 --> 00:02:03.258]  There's some in foreign nations.
[00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:09.692]  And under scientific controls, they have removed samples from several of these.
[00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:11.073]  They have tested them.
[00:02:11.133 --> 00:02:12.534]  It's been peer-reviewed.
[00:02:12.994 --> 00:02:16.997]  Other physicists and engineers have taken part in the testing.
[00:02:17.897 --> 00:02:19.978]  We have not released those names at this time.
[00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:23.040]  And Stephen Jones has released many of his findings.
[00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.302]  He's releasing all of it here in the near future.
[00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.101]  This is huge.
[00:02:29.161 --> 00:02:31.022]  This is so huge.
[00:02:31.063 --> 00:02:39.890]  Just a few months ago, we saw the video, the photos of the hot molten steel pouring out of the building.
[00:02:41.511 --> 00:02:44.434]  The 9-11 Commission tried to claim it was aluminum, which of course it wasn't.
[00:02:45.174 --> 00:02:47.496]  Well, now they have had a chance to test it.
[00:02:47.997 --> 00:02:53.381]  That is coming up in the next hour with Professor Stephen Jones.
[00:02:55.543 --> 00:02:56.364]  In the meantime...
[00:02:59.036 --> 00:03:02.199]  Connecticut City Leaders OK Riverfront Evictions.
[00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:03.760]  It's happening right now.
[00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:07.343]  And they're not even being given just compensation.
[00:03:09.044 --> 00:03:10.445]  The homes have been condemned.
[00:03:10.986 --> 00:03:12.747]  They're giving them lot value.
[00:03:13.728 --> 00:03:20.533]  And in some cases, they're going to charge them rent for the last five years that they fought the city.
[00:03:20.573 --> 00:03:26.498]  So, in the future, if you fight the city, the county, or any other group taking your private property for a private interest...
[00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:27.980]  We're good to go.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.180]  I think?
[00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.781]  Signaling that the end is near in an imminent domain dispute that reached the U.S.
[00:03:58.801 --> 00:03:59.501]  Supreme Court.
[00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:05.602]  Of course, that's an improper term here from Associated Press writer Stephen Singer.
[00:04:06.042 --> 00:04:08.123]  It's not an imminent domain dispute.
[00:04:08.243 --> 00:04:10.163]  It's something new in U.S.
[00:04:10.203 --> 00:04:10.563]  history.
[00:04:11.103 --> 00:04:18.725]  Private interests want your property for condominiums or for a chemical plant or for a pharmacological...
[00:04:19.831 --> 00:04:23.792]  Headquarters for Big Pharma, and they just take it.
[00:04:25.572 --> 00:04:26.673]  They just take it.
[00:04:27.893 --> 00:04:34.714]  So we'll be getting into this wonderful freedom, one of the many new freedoms we have, the freedom to have our property taken.
[00:04:37.535 --> 00:04:39.996]  We'll also get into some good news.
[00:04:40.036 --> 00:04:46.037]  New Orleans Chief of Police backs down on gun confiscation, at least for now.
[00:04:49.403 --> 00:04:53.647]  The city councilman compares Cleveland teens to terrorists, says they have no rights.
[00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:56.050]  There's a lot of news.
[00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.111]  It's all important.
[00:04:57.151 --> 00:04:58.833]  Stay with us, prisonplanet.com.
[00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:08.987]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here, and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[00:05:09.188 --> 00:05:11.510]  We're expecting around 1,000 people in attendance.
[00:05:12.111 --> 00:05:20.980]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.982]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda.
[00:05:25.443 --> 00:05:46.276]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Tarpley, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[00:05:46.557 --> 00:05:50.199]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.002]  Arm yourself with the truth.

[00:06:01.053 --> 00:06:09.675]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:06:09.895 --> 00:06:21.177]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:06:21.377 --> 00:06:24.018]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:24.378 --> 00:06:25.019]  We're good to go.

[00:06:58.213 --> 00:06:59.514]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:01.495 --> 00:07:07.540]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:08.501]  Globalist
[00:07:15.282 --> 00:07:15.942]  We're good to go.
[00:07:39.855 --> 00:07:41.876]  The Nationalist Times, just $19 for one year.

[00:08:02.913 --> 00:08:08.916]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.536 --> 00:08:12.577]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:20.461 --> 00:08:29.424]  Big developments in the controlled demolition of World Trade Center Tower 1, 2, and 7.
[00:08:31.713 --> 00:08:35.196]  We have Professor Stephen E. Jones joining us in the next hour.
[00:08:35.256 --> 00:08:38.459]  They have tested steel from the collapse.
[00:08:38.479 --> 00:08:44.324]  They were able to get a hold of specific steel that had been cut in neat little pieces during the collapse.
[00:08:44.564 --> 00:08:55.033]  And sure enough, all of the exact derivatives, the byproducts of thermite, but not just thermite cutting charges, the patented specific industry products,
[00:08:57.975 --> 00:09:09.685]  He'll be joining us for this breaking news coming up in the next hour.
[00:09:10.266 --> 00:09:13.108]  It's so important that he hasn't been doing radio interviews.
[00:09:13.588 --> 00:09:19.794]  I was the first person to interview him on radio, and then shortly after that he ceased doing radio interviews because he was besieged by calls.
[00:09:20.402 --> 00:09:31.124]  Well, he will be coming back out here on the air, coming up in the next hour, so you definitely do not want to miss that.
[00:09:33.285 --> 00:09:48.728]  In the meantime, in the last segment, the first segment, I mentioned the New London, Connecticut ruling of last year saying that a private interest, and this is in the Supreme Court ruling, go and lobby a city, a county, or a state
[00:09:49.628 --> 00:09:57.692]  To take your private property, that they are allowed to give campaign contributions to your elected servants.
[00:09:58.313 --> 00:10:12.420]  You notice they've been calling themselves officials, authorities, our bosses, oh, your great excellency city council member, oh, your honorable mayor, honorable judge.
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.041]  All of this is so un-American.
[00:10:15.942 --> 00:10:17.983]  Fits right in in Napoleonic France, or
[00:10:19.059 --> 00:10:22.801]  Caesar's Rome or Fidel Castro's Cuba, but not here.
[00:10:22.861 --> 00:10:27.204]  But we're going into slavery, going into bondage, as every other civilization has.
[00:10:27.504 --> 00:10:28.324]  They always do.
[00:10:29.085 --> 00:10:36.509]  The average American's been told by the media that tyranny doesn't exist in America, never could, never will, and that everything's just fine, it can't happen here.
[00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:38.530]  It is happening here.
[00:10:40.051 --> 00:10:46.595]  City officials voted Monday night to evict residents who refused to leave the riverfront homes, signaling the end of
[00:10:47.168 --> 00:10:49.669]  To the dispute that reached the U.S.
[00:10:49.709 --> 00:10:50.450]  Supreme Court.
[00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.311]  The city council approved the action 5-2.
[00:10:53.772 --> 00:11:04.517]  The city attorney will now go to court to seek the removal of the remaining two families and obtain the properties in the Fort Trumbull neighborhood, a process that could take three months.
[00:11:05.278 --> 00:11:13.242]  The city has been trying for a decade to redevelop the once vibrant neighborhood at the point where the Thames River joins the sea.
[00:11:14.002 --> 00:11:26.830]  Several homeowners challenged the city's plans to seize the property and build a hotel, convention center, and upscale condominiums, saying eminent domain can't be used to make way for private development.
[00:11:28.951 --> 00:11:29.972]  Now let's be clear here.
[00:11:29.992 --> 00:11:32.313]  You notice how the Associated Press spins this.
[00:11:32.413 --> 00:11:34.114]  The once vibrant neighborhood.
[00:11:35.876 --> 00:11:39.698]  And then they go on to admit that for a decade they've, quote, been trying to take it.
[00:11:40.922 --> 00:11:56.376]  For a decade, they've walked up to, in some cases, three-story beautiful Victorian homes with porches all the way around them, with multiple generations of families living there, doctors, lawyers, software engineers.
[00:11:56.977 --> 00:11:59.599]  These are the type of individuals that we've interviewed on this broadcast.
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.063]  The houses are valued on average at over $300,000 apiece.
[00:12:08.956 --> 00:12:14.257]  We've seen private interest stealing land for a while, what they call blighted areas.
[00:12:15.797 --> 00:12:16.557]  And I'm against that.
[00:12:16.617 --> 00:12:20.838]  If somebody owns their house, no one should be able to take it unless it's something like a highway.
[00:12:22.078 --> 00:12:22.458]  That's it.
[00:12:23.199 --> 00:12:26.959]  Not a stupid football stadium, not a golf course, not a shopping mall.
[00:12:26.999 --> 00:12:37.261]  I don't care what economic development it brings to the area or if the real estate council wants to snatch the land so they can then make more profits off the property they own around it.
[00:12:38.086 --> 00:12:38.426]  We're good to go.
[00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:04.635]  They will go by the houses on both sides of your home and then bulldoze those and smash those and run jackhammers at 2 a.m.
[00:13:05.035 --> 00:13:05.936]  to harass you.
[00:13:05.996 --> 00:13:09.978]  Bulldozers have pulled up to homes, threatening people, saying it's condemned.
[00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:11.419]  Come out, we're going to bulldoze it.
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:18.144]  I mean, this type of stuff has gone on over and over and over again on a monthly basis there.
[00:13:18.685 --> 00:13:23.228]  Police harassing people, harassing demonstrators.
[00:13:24.569 --> 00:13:25.209]  It's a mess.
[00:13:25.329 --> 00:13:26.310]  But the biggest...
[00:13:27.501 --> 00:13:30.707]  Point to this whole story that the mainstream media has never picked up on.
[00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:32.630]  It has been in local papers.
[00:13:33.471 --> 00:13:35.395]  There in the New London area, in Connecticut.
[00:13:37.218 --> 00:13:38.821]  It has been published.
[00:13:38.881 --> 00:13:39.482]  It's admitted.
[00:13:40.968 --> 00:14:08.204]  That what they do is they come in and say, well, now we're going to give you $60,000 for your home that's $305,000 on the tax rolls because you refused to sell it to us, and so now we're just condemning it, so when we do pay you off, we're just going to give you $60-something thousand dollars, and oh, by the way, we're then going to sue you claiming that for the five years you've been fighting us in one case of Michael Cristofaro, who we've interviewed,
[00:14:09.688 --> 00:14:13.251]  Because you held us up, and that was really our property the whole time.
[00:14:13.331 --> 00:14:18.315]  So they're talking about nuisance, harassment, really racketeering-type lawsuits.
[00:14:21.097 --> 00:14:31.625]  And there's several other facets that have made it into the national news, but the national media behaves as if it's kosher, as if it's okay, as if it's acceptable.
[00:14:32.686 --> 00:14:36.869]  And that is that multiple members of the city council have their husbands and wives arrested
[00:14:37.487 --> 00:14:38.748]  Oh, that's not a conflict of interest.
[00:15:07.131 --> 00:15:25.118]  One of the city councilmen's wife is on the board of the group that then comes and pays campaign contributions directly to the city council, to the county commissioners, and to many of the other elected officials, authorities, i.e.
[00:15:25.278 --> 00:15:27.839]  our masters, our bosses.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:36.523]  CNN had a poll on Lou Dobbs' program last year about this, and 99% of respondents, and it was a scientific poll,
[00:15:38.817 --> 00:15:42.458]  99% are against the new London, Connecticut ruling.
[00:15:42.998 --> 00:15:43.758]  Supreme Court ruling.
[00:15:44.178 --> 00:15:45.138]  Does the government care?
[00:15:46.619 --> 00:15:56.800]  Do they care that in Texas, 97% in the Houston Chronicle polls are against most of the major highways being converted over to toll roads and it's owned by a foreign company?
[00:15:57.761 --> 00:15:58.061]  No!
[00:15:58.781 --> 00:16:00.381]  The majority of the politicians are for it.
[00:16:00.401 --> 00:16:01.141]  They're on the payroll.
[00:16:01.161 --> 00:16:02.121]  They've already taken the money.
[00:16:03.242 --> 00:16:04.102]  And it's the same case.
[00:16:04.142 --> 00:16:04.962]  City councilmen...
[00:16:05.859 --> 00:16:11.862]  People on the state CAMPO board, their husbands, their wives, their sons, their daughters.
[00:16:12.823 --> 00:16:13.463]  It's incredible.
[00:16:13.523 --> 00:16:16.145]  Some of them are pulling down $300,000 a year.
[00:16:16.185 --> 00:16:21.048]  Just open payoffs in plain view, and that's even in our papers.
[00:16:21.688 --> 00:16:26.391]  And they just thumb their nose and say, Hey, we put the police chiefs in.
[00:16:27.011 --> 00:16:28.132]  We control the state police.
[00:16:28.152 --> 00:16:29.192]  We control the grand juries.
[00:16:29.593 --> 00:16:31.734]  There's nothing you can do.
[00:16:32.446 --> 00:16:34.207]  We're going to rob you.
[00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:37.029]  I mean, that's the attitude.
[00:16:37.049 --> 00:16:48.037]  Oh, 95% of national polls are against the new Freedom Initiative for forced psychological testing of the entire population ages 4 to 18.
[00:16:48.098 --> 00:16:51.780]  And some states now quote all pregnant women or anyone that goes to the hospital.
[00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:55.043]  And the guidelines were openly written by the drug companies two years ago.
[00:16:55.343 --> 00:16:57.885]  And one of their own executives went public in Ohio today.
[00:16:58.485 --> 00:17:14.336]  Last year, Ann reported and released the documents that they brag about how it's really a plan, no kidding, to put the population on drugs forcibly, and they brag that they've got 15% of the kids on the drugs now, and that within five years they'll have 50% on drugs.
[00:17:14.356 --> 00:17:18.459]  95% of us in major polls are against it.
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:20.821]  It's unconstitutional.
[00:17:20.901 --> 00:17:22.022]  It's Soviet style.
[00:17:22.122 --> 00:17:22.762]  It's horrible.
[00:17:22.842 --> 00:17:23.763]  It's Brave New World.
[00:17:23.823 --> 00:17:24.464]  It's Big Brother.
[00:17:24.964 --> 00:17:25.624]  They don't care.
[00:17:25.684 --> 00:17:26.285]  They passed it.
[00:17:27.402 --> 00:17:33.428]  I mean, New Freedom passed by some unbelievable majority, I forget the exact numbers, in the House and the Senate.
[00:17:34.248 --> 00:17:37.872]  Americans, 80 plus percent, are against the open borders.
[00:17:38.432 --> 00:17:46.159]  Republicans and Democrats vote together for terrible blanket amnesty, and then tell you it's not amnesty, and Bush puts one dozen guardsmen on the border, that's CNN, not 6,000.
[00:17:49.651 --> 00:17:50.991]  It's all a sick joke.
[00:17:51.011 --> 00:17:53.112]  Same thing with Schwarzenegger, same thing with Perry.
[00:17:53.652 --> 00:17:59.934]  It is a sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick joke.
[00:18:00.395 --> 00:18:00.755]  All of it.
[00:18:00.835 --> 00:18:06.757]  It is grade A, pure, 24 karat gold corruption.
[00:18:07.937 --> 00:18:11.198]  In your face, 110%, pulling out all the stops.
[00:18:16.801 --> 00:18:23.164]  The president is announcing he is above the law on torture, NSA spying, open borders, buying fake news.
[00:18:23.204 --> 00:18:24.244]  It's been ruled illegal.
[00:18:26.906 --> 00:18:28.346]  Hillary Clinton's pro-war.
[00:18:29.207 --> 00:18:31.048]  It's just they don't care what the people want.
[00:18:31.088 --> 00:18:32.408]  They're a pack of criminals.
[00:18:32.448 --> 00:18:35.069]  We have been totally hijacked as a nation.
[00:18:38.231 --> 00:18:40.292]  And now they are going to start taking the homes.
[00:18:40.452 --> 00:18:44.974]  Michael Cristofaro, one of two holdout residents, spoke out before the vote yesterday.
[00:18:45.555 --> 00:18:51.957]  Against the property seizures and singled out the five council members who ended up voting to take the property.
[00:18:52.457 --> 00:18:55.478]  You are a disgrace to the city, the state, and the nation, he said.
[00:18:55.498 --> 00:19:00.900]  The other holdout was Suzette Kello, who we also interviewed, the lead plaintiff.
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:12.343]  Governor M. Jody Rell had proposed letting the holdouts remain in their homes, but giving the city the right of first refusal if their houses were ever put up for sale.
[00:19:13.126 --> 00:19:18.808]  The eviction process, which includes another court fight, would take a month to three months.
[00:19:22.049 --> 00:19:23.910]  And a lot of people say, oh, that won't affect us.
[00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:25.691]  You know, my state won't do that.
[00:19:25.811 --> 00:19:29.152]  Right here in Texas, these are middle class people.
[00:19:29.192 --> 00:19:36.075]  Imagine, I mean, and the reason I make that point is not that middle class are any better than poor people, but it's when they start going after middle class people, we're in trouble.
[00:19:36.795 --> 00:19:37.735]  Shows the boldness.
[00:19:38.576 --> 00:19:39.876]  Remember Western Seafood?
[00:19:39.896 --> 00:19:41.557]  Freeport, Texas?
[00:19:43.155 --> 00:19:50.821]  A private interest wants the land they've had since 1940, and the state's moving to take it.
[00:19:50.961 --> 00:19:51.942]  They're not even going to pay them.
[00:19:52.423 --> 00:19:53.283]  Just compensation.
[00:19:54.584 --> 00:19:56.506]  See, that's what's really in these rulings.
[00:19:57.587 --> 00:19:58.307]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:58.327 --> 00:19:58.768]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.081 --> 00:20:01.681]  We're good to go.

[00:21:00.876 --> 00:21:01.336]  Gold.
[00:21:01.676 --> 00:21:02.977]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:21:03.217 --> 00:21:09.300]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:13.322]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:21:13.662 --> 00:21:15.543]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:21:15.603 --> 00:21:17.904]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:21:18.045 --> 00:21:25.108]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[00:21:25.148 --> 00:21:25.789]  We're good to go.
[00:21:44.123 --> 00:21:46.524]  For the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.

[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.041]  The war on terrorism.
[00:22:03.382 --> 00:22:06.145]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:22:06.425 --> 00:22:10.590]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:11.851]  So what do you do?
[00:22:12.152 --> 00:22:16.757]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:22:17.237 --> 00:22:19.300]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:22:19.821 --> 00:22:34.526]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:22:34.566 --> 00:22:41.668]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[00:23:00.223 --> 00:23:04.266]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want the milk.
[00:23:04.487 --> 00:23:07.870]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:11.473]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:23:11.781 --> 00:23:15.024]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:23:15.044 --> 00:23:20.509]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:30.178]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[00:23:30.318 --> 00:23:31.659]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[00:23:31.699 --> 00:23:37.104]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[00:23:37.581 --> 00:23:42.023]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[00:23:42.043 --> 00:23:43.483]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[00:23:43.643 --> 00:23:47.465]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[00:23:47.565 --> 00:23:48.385]  That toll-free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.301]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:08.762 --> 00:24:11.583]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:13.905 --> 00:24:22.810]  Huge interview scheduled next hour with Professor Stephen Jones, Doctor of Physics, conclusive evidence of thermite bombs in the towers.
[00:24:23.991 --> 00:24:25.232]  Thermite cutting charges.
[00:24:25.252 --> 00:24:27.433]  You know, this is what happens.
[00:24:27.673 --> 00:24:30.715]  We talk about the New London Ruling and then we just kind of move on.
[00:24:31.295 --> 00:24:32.296]  And people forget about it.
[00:24:32.516 --> 00:24:33.697]  Oh yeah, I remember that ruling.
[00:24:34.406 --> 00:24:42.888]  And then all over the country, from New York to California to Oregon to Texas, I've even seen an Austin case where they're now trying to use the Supreme Court ruling.
[00:24:43.428 --> 00:24:46.368]  They are moving to go after private property.
[00:24:46.468 --> 00:24:50.069]  And that is so un-American, so anti-freedom.
[00:24:51.609 --> 00:25:04.092]  I mean, even after the Magna Carta of 1215, there at the Battle of Runnymede in England, the king, if you were a free man, that's what they called people who weren't indentured servants or serfs who...
[00:25:04.983 --> 00:25:09.105]  You know, still lived as part of the patronage on Noble's property.
[00:25:10.185 --> 00:25:11.466]  No one could take your land.
[00:25:12.246 --> 00:25:13.807]  No one could take it for taxes.
[00:25:14.307 --> 00:25:15.908]  They could not get it.
[00:25:17.428 --> 00:25:19.309]  But that has changed.
[00:25:19.489 --> 00:25:32.094]  Even debtors, people who could go to jail, to debtor's prisons for not paying their debts, you still could take somebody's home if they owned it outright unless they had specifically gotten loans on the home itself.
[00:25:33.255 --> 00:25:33.435]  So,
[00:25:34.568 --> 00:25:39.392]  Now we are at the threshold of a whole new level of despotism.
[00:25:40.473 --> 00:25:47.459]  So I would like to talk about this because hundreds and hundreds of families 10 years ago, it was over 200, refused to move out.
[00:25:48.339 --> 00:25:54.945]  And so when the Associated Press says the once vibrant neighborhood, oh yes, most of it was bulldozed, most of it was torn up.
[00:25:55.425 --> 00:25:57.827]  They bulldozed the restaurants, they bulldozed all of it.
[00:25:58.227 --> 00:25:59.408]  People didn't want to sell.
[00:26:00.249 --> 00:26:01.390]  Some did, some didn't.
[00:26:03.514 --> 00:26:08.056]  And now private interests all over the country are moving in to take land.
[00:26:08.076 --> 00:26:15.299]  I mean, the Western Seafood case, the Gore family, we had the, what, third-generation owner on.
[00:26:16.319 --> 00:26:18.980]  His grandfather bought the land in the 40s.
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:20.180]  His father worked for him.
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.761]  He then grew up working there.
[00:26:21.781 --> 00:26:25.702]  And it was in the Houston Chronicle, and Mr. Gore talked about it on air.
[00:26:26.123 --> 00:26:29.564]  You know what they made in 2004 alone?
[00:26:29.584 --> 00:26:32.445]  Because we interviewed them last year, and they were giving us the year before's numbers.
[00:26:33.047 --> 00:26:40.050]  Guess what Western Seafood made profit-wise that very year?
[00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:41.790]  $44 million.
[00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:52.194]  Now, understand, private interests are able to go in and make political contributions there in Freeport, Texas.
[00:26:54.255 --> 00:26:59.717]  And by the way, it's the main heir to the mobile fortune who wants this big yacht club.
[00:27:01.048 --> 00:27:06.010]  And he's already come in and muscled the land in two places.
[00:27:06.831 --> 00:27:15.554]  And they're trying to pay Mr. Gore a fraction of what his huge dock space and factory is worth.
[00:27:17.095 --> 00:27:17.535]  Literally.
[00:27:18.615 --> 00:27:24.678]  Now, do you think any of you are safe if a family that made $44 million in profit in 2004 isn't safe?
[00:27:24.698 --> 00:27:24.758]  No.
[00:27:29.981 --> 00:27:31.081]  None of us are safe.
[00:27:32.642 --> 00:27:37.883]  So many people who make a million dollars a year, a hundred thousand dollars a year, whatever, you think you're members of the elite.
[00:27:37.943 --> 00:27:38.503]  You're not.
[00:27:39.483 --> 00:27:40.724]  You're not members of the elite.
[00:27:41.544 --> 00:27:45.385]  Now, if you're the heir of the mobile fortune, yes, you're a member of the elite.
[00:27:47.285 --> 00:27:53.167]  And this individual has gone in and openly given massive contributions to the city council.
[00:27:53.207 --> 00:27:54.567]  He basically owns the city council.
[00:27:55.362 --> 00:27:56.802]  And we've got to get Mr. Gore back on.
[00:27:56.862 --> 00:27:59.803]  Last time I talked to him, he was on the verge of losing his property.
[00:28:01.004 --> 00:28:06.966]  And, by the way, the city was, again, they're trying to set this precedent.
[00:28:07.746 --> 00:28:09.426]  They're not even taking best price.
[00:28:11.087 --> 00:28:11.487]  Okay?
[00:28:11.867 --> 00:28:17.929]  I mean, always an eminent domain in the past, they've had to pay what the property is on the tax rules.
[00:28:18.783 --> 00:28:21.624]  And then the cost of moving a factory or moving a home.
[00:28:22.324 --> 00:28:26.205]  So you're normally looking at about 20% over the tax roll.
[00:28:26.525 --> 00:28:32.827]  So we're talking about almost $400,000 for a $300,000 house.
[00:28:32.867 --> 00:28:36.348]  But in New London, no, we're going to give you, what was it, $61,000, $62,000, $65,000?
[00:28:36.648 --> 00:28:37.228]  I forget.
[00:28:37.328 --> 00:28:44.310]  It was $60-something thousand dollars that was in the newspaper that they were offering them for the lot value.
[00:28:45.891 --> 00:28:47.131]  So what happens is,
[00:28:49.642 --> 00:28:55.127]  They've got national associations of counties, national associations of cities, national associations of mayors, national associations of governors.
[00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:57.809]  They've got the National Association of City Managers.
[00:28:57.949 --> 00:29:03.493]  All of this, they've codified it, and we're seeing the same thing in Ohio, Texas, Tennessee, California.
[00:29:04.234 --> 00:29:06.056]  I see these cases every day now.
[00:29:07.537 --> 00:29:12.221]  They're coming in and saying, we're only going to give you lot value.
[00:29:13.642 --> 00:29:18.406]  So that's even bigger than the federal ruling saying,
[00:29:19.654 --> 00:29:26.539]  Stating that of a private interest, once you're land, they can come pay off politicians and take it.
[00:29:26.559 --> 00:29:32.943]  So all that's happening here is highway robbery, extortion, racketeering is being legalized.
[00:29:33.904 --> 00:29:35.585]  Remember the Supreme Court ruling last week?
[00:29:37.386 --> 00:29:44.931]  Police officers, prosecutors, people who refuse to lie, people who blow the whistle on corruption, frame-ups in this one case.
[00:29:46.551 --> 00:29:47.713]  They lose their jobs.
[00:29:47.733 --> 00:29:50.618]  You're not allowed to blow the whistle on felony.
[00:29:51.019 --> 00:29:51.940]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.421 --> 00:29:54.024]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.044 --> 00:29:57.630]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.621 --> 00:30:07.042]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the US have diabetes.
[00:30:07.382 --> 00:30:14.323]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[00:30:14.463 --> 00:30:18.984]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[00:30:19.184 --> 00:30:22.005]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[00:31:01.287 --> 00:31:09.550]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:09.791 --> 00:31:14.152]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.432 --> 00:31:23.356]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:23.556 --> 00:31:27.198]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound and is recyclable.
[00:31:27.478 --> 00:31:32.504]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:32.804 --> 00:31:39.531]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:31:40.032 --> 00:31:40.553]  What about you?

[00:32:02.358 --> 00:32:03.199]  Come on, Bill.
[00:32:03.419 --> 00:32:08.582]  Two weeks ago you were riding a bicycle, and today you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[00:32:08.922 --> 00:32:10.423]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[00:32:10.523 --> 00:32:12.484]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[00:32:12.764 --> 00:32:18.288]  What I did do is visit the website www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[00:32:18.588 --> 00:32:24.851]  That's where I learned how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[00:32:25.172 --> 00:32:27.373]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[00:32:27.653 --> 00:32:29.054]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week.
[00:32:31.315 --> 00:32:31.715]  Whoa.
[00:32:32.115 --> 00:32:33.316]  What was that website again?
[00:32:33.396 --> 00:32:36.897]  It's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[00:32:37.197 --> 00:32:38.297]  Now write this down, John.
[00:32:38.437 --> 00:32:42.738]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[00:32:42.878 --> 00:32:43.458]  Thanks, Bill.
[00:32:43.738 --> 00:32:44.959]  I'm going there right now.
[00:32:45.359 --> 00:32:46.019]  Check, please.
[00:32:47.819 --> 00:32:49.240]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:50.320]  Sure, John.
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:54.901]  Don't forget, it's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[00:32:55.201 --> 00:32:56.902]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[00:32:57.062 --> 00:32:57.322]  Deal.
[00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:09.534]  I'm not trying to be negative about the state of this country.
[00:33:21.184 --> 00:33:23.806]  I mean, we have a president who is getting rid of the borders.
[00:33:51.184 --> 00:33:58.192]  The official Council on Foreign Relations policies are being implemented by the Canadian, U.S., and Mexican governments.
[00:33:59.313 --> 00:34:03.318]  Even national television admits we're going to have the Amero note very soon.
[00:34:04.116 --> 00:34:22.909]  We are going into the American Union, and I heard a neocon talk show host on national radio yesterday evening as I was driving in my car, and he had two callers in a row go, Bush's amnesty is a fraud, it's a scam, and the host said, yeah, I think Bush is just confused and has some bad advisors.
[00:34:23.638 --> 00:34:30.843]  And then the callers were both saying, because I only had time to listen to two of them, but there was two in a row, well, it's about the American Union, the Pan-American Union.
[00:34:30.903 --> 00:34:31.564]  It's official.
[00:34:32.044 --> 00:34:35.246]  And the host would hang up on them and say, no, that's a conspiracy.
[00:34:35.727 --> 00:34:36.907]  Bush is just inept.
[00:34:37.008 --> 00:34:38.088]  He's just dumb.
[00:34:39.049 --> 00:34:40.410]  They say that about everything.
[00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:50.717]  I mean, when Dr. Frederick Whitehurst went public six, seven years ago saying that there was total fraud at the FBI crime lab framing people, the news said, that's impossible.
[00:34:50.777 --> 00:34:51.578]  They're too inept.
[00:34:52.628 --> 00:35:00.451]  So the next time somebody gets caught robbing a bank wearing the black mask and has the gun and the guns in somebody's head, just go, oh, I'm too inept to rob a bank.
[00:35:00.511 --> 00:35:02.132]  I just wore this mask by accident.
[00:35:03.453 --> 00:35:13.737]  I guess Enron was too inept to be running fake energy trading scams and have whole false stock markets they were showing members of the state legislatures and Congress.
[00:35:14.898 --> 00:35:17.840]  No, ladies and gentlemen, the government would have you believe they're inept.
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:19.521]  There's nothing inept about it.
[00:35:19.781 --> 00:35:21.042]  They've taken the whole country.
[00:35:21.282 --> 00:35:22.583]  They're stealing us blind.
[00:35:24.124 --> 00:35:27.606]  There's nothing inept about raiding your pension funds.
[00:35:27.626 --> 00:35:31.349]  There's nothing inept about ruling that private interests can lobby and take your property.
[00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:34.511]  There's nothing inept about any of it.
[00:35:34.531 --> 00:35:39.274]  There's nothing inept about the NSA having offices in every major phone company listening to everything.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:41.660]  This is systematic.
[00:35:41.701 --> 00:35:42.881]  These people are in command.
[00:35:42.901 --> 00:35:48.544]  They're in control because they're powerful, because they're smart, because they know what they're doing, because they're ruthless.
[00:35:49.704 --> 00:35:52.606]  Now, we're going to open the phones up at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:35:52.726 --> 00:35:55.027]  I've got other news here.
[00:35:56.027 --> 00:35:59.429]  New Orleans Chief backs down on gun grab from Newsmax.
[00:35:59.449 --> 00:36:00.509]  This is some good news.
[00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:02.370]  There is some good news.
[00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:04.651]  But, again, we've got to be positive here.
[00:36:05.032 --> 00:36:06.732]  It's positive that we're on the air.
[00:36:07.093 --> 00:36:10.034]  It's positive that we're admitting the country is basically on fire.
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:11.501]  The house is on fire.
[00:36:12.641 --> 00:36:14.903]  Councilman compares Cleveland teens to terrorists.
[00:36:14.963 --> 00:36:20.006]  I have some audio clips I want to play coming up of my bullhorning there in Chicago.
[00:36:21.026 --> 00:36:26.810]  I have a clip of that Ohio City Councilman saying everybody's a terrorist.
[00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:30.071]  Courts and Congress push back against Bush.
[00:36:30.292 --> 00:36:32.493]  This is propaganda out of USA Today.
[00:36:32.873 --> 00:36:34.094]  They aren't really pushing back.
[00:36:35.415 --> 00:36:38.216]  6,000 murdered in Baghdad alone this year so far.
[00:36:38.336 --> 00:36:38.576]  U.S.
[00:36:38.596 --> 00:36:39.317]  death squads
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:41.981]  The unmentionable factor.
[00:36:42.001 --> 00:36:45.683]  That's just some of the news we'll be going over.
[00:36:47.304 --> 00:36:51.606]  Before I do that, I want to go to Debbie Morrow of New Millennium Concepts.
[00:36:51.806 --> 00:36:52.987]  It's made in America.
[00:36:53.387 --> 00:36:55.888]  It is the American Berkey water filter.
[00:36:55.908 --> 00:36:57.589]  They also have the British ones if you'd like those.
[00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:01.091]  It is the highest standard, the highest quality available.
[00:37:01.631 --> 00:37:02.772]  It's what I've been using.
[00:37:03.467 --> 00:37:04.248]  Since 1998.
[00:37:04.528 --> 00:37:06.749]  I did my research then.
[00:37:06.769 --> 00:37:09.711]  And you get wholesale prices.
[00:37:10.171 --> 00:37:16.255]  One of these filters is $300 plus on average at a camping supply place or a health food store.
[00:37:16.555 --> 00:37:18.856]  And a lot of times they're Indian or Chinese knockoffs.
[00:37:20.157 --> 00:37:21.398]  You know, little hollow filters.
[00:37:21.438 --> 00:37:22.339]  These filters are heavy.
[00:37:22.379 --> 00:37:26.921]  They're full of the material that purifies your water.
[00:37:27.422 --> 00:37:29.163]  Debbie, thank you for joining us.
[00:37:29.503 --> 00:37:30.404]  Hi there, Alex.
[00:37:30.464 --> 00:37:32.365]  Thank you so very much for having me.
[00:37:33.251 --> 00:37:40.073]  I tell you, the hurricane season's coming up, and last year you guys sold out for the time until the factory could make more here in the U.S.
[00:37:40.633 --> 00:37:44.034]  But, Debbie, that's not my reason for having murkies.
[00:37:44.635 --> 00:37:53.718]  The crisis is in the water, the dead bacteria, the chlorine only kills them, the sodium and stannous fluoride, the herbicides, the pesticides, all of it.
[00:37:54.498 --> 00:37:55.778]  Why should we filter our water?
[00:37:56.819 --> 00:38:01.180]  We really need to filter our water so that we're taking control of our own good health.
[00:38:02.017 --> 00:38:05.679]  And making sure we're not being poisoned just a little bit at a time, you know?
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:24.067]  You know, I think everybody can think about the grandma that they have had in the past or someone they know who never smoked, never drank, grew their own food, and still ended up dying of cancer or something, you know?
[00:38:24.087 --> 00:38:26.268]  And a lot of it is because they're drinking.
[00:38:28.161 --> 00:38:29.462]  Yeah, we're good.
[00:38:49.136 --> 00:38:50.636]  In the streams and everything.
[00:38:50.656 --> 00:38:59.478]  So by filtering your water, you're absolutely sure that you're getting the best possible quality water out there.
[00:38:59.878 --> 00:39:17.541]  And what's great about the new Black Berkey purification elements, because they are purification elements, they're not just filters, you can actually put red food coloring in the top tank with your source water, and it will come through clear water.
[00:39:18.149 --> 00:39:31.372]  And that's an indicator for you to know you can test your filters and make sure that you are really getting the best possible clean water, which we are not aware of any other filters out there that you can do that with.
[00:39:33.752 --> 00:39:41.634]  And so we'd just like to encourage everybody to buy Berkey now before it gets to be so busy and then, you know, you're lining up waiting for them.
[00:39:43.905 --> 00:39:50.669]  Well, Debbie, I mean, I don't know how we convince people who've been procrastinating to stop drinking the poison that's in the water.
[00:39:51.149 --> 00:39:58.074]  I recommend they go to the EPA's own website where they admit the allowable levels of thousands of substances.
[00:39:59.054 --> 00:39:59.755]  Here's an example.
[00:40:00.735 --> 00:40:02.836]  Houston water is so bad it stinks.
[00:40:02.876 --> 00:40:03.597]  You can smell it.
[00:40:03.677 --> 00:40:05.118]  Dallas water is not much better.
[00:40:05.218 --> 00:40:11.121]  I was in Chicago and didn't have any bottled water, hadn't brought one of my sport murkies with me.
[00:40:11.181 --> 00:40:13.683]  I left in a hurry over the weekend.
[00:40:14.301 --> 00:40:25.669]  And I filled up a glass of tap water there in the bathroom in my hotel room, and it literally, literally tasted five times stronger than pool water.
[00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:28.171]  I mean, it was just horrible.
[00:40:29.132 --> 00:40:32.274]  And then people gave me iced glasses of water.
[00:40:32.314 --> 00:40:35.817]  I'd take drinks up, and it tasted like kerosene.
[00:40:35.977 --> 00:40:38.459]  I don't know how people do this.
[00:40:38.699 --> 00:40:42.502]  I guess their tongues, their palates are just accustomed to it.
[00:40:43.121 --> 00:40:57.605]  I think that's it because to tell you the truth, before I started drinking Berkey water, I didn't drink bottled water and I was so accustomed to the tap water that, you know, it tasted strange to me to be drinking water that didn't taste like chlorine.
[00:40:58.185 --> 00:41:05.908]  So it actually does, your palate does get used to the chlorinated water if you drink it straight out of the tap.
[00:41:06.768 --> 00:41:10.789]  And, you know, we really do want to encourage people
[00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:16.332]  That this is not only helpful for you, but it's also cost-effective.
[00:41:16.672 --> 00:41:28.560]  Because if you are buying bottled water, the Berkey pays for itself, like within just weeks or months of you purchasing the Berkey instead of buying bottled water.
[00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:29.221]  Absolutely.
[00:41:29.261 --> 00:41:31.282]  Debbie, give folks the toll-free number to give you a call.
[00:41:31.542 --> 00:41:31.762]  It's 1-888-803-4438.
[00:41:36.405 --> 00:41:37.546]  It's now repeated.
[00:41:37.626 --> 00:41:38.066]  It's 1-888-803-4438.
[00:41:38.086 --> 00:41:51.932]  And also you can go to our website, which is BerkeyWater.com, and it's spelled B-E-R-K-E-Y-W-A-T-E-R.com.
[00:41:52.372 --> 00:41:55.173]  And be sure to put that you heard it on Alex Jones.
[00:41:56.042 --> 00:42:01.783]  And that you want your free Berkey Sport bottle or... Potassium iodate or sheltering in place.
[00:42:01.823 --> 00:42:03.784]  Debbie, thank you so much for talking with us today.
[00:42:03.944 --> 00:42:05.544]  Oh, thank you very much, Alex.
[00:42:05.604 --> 00:42:07.264]  Take care and have a great week.
[00:42:07.904 --> 00:42:08.885]  Feels like the weekend to me.
[00:42:08.905 --> 00:42:12.245]  I almost said have a great weekend because I'm about to leave to go to Bilderberg today.
[00:42:12.946 --> 00:42:15.586]  Jack Blood will be sitting in on Thursday and Friday.
[00:42:15.606 --> 00:42:18.147]  I'll be doing live call-ins from there.
[00:42:19.327 --> 00:42:22.347]  I'm also going to be there at the Capitol there at Ottawa.
[00:42:23.988 --> 00:42:25.028]  There in the city of Ottawa.
[00:42:25.959 --> 00:42:32.402]  Where we have the supposed target of the Muslim terrorists, so we can report on that for you as well.
[00:42:33.882 --> 00:42:35.663]  You can also go to InfoWars.com.
[00:42:35.683 --> 00:42:38.204]  They have the exact same Berkey filters, exact same specials.
[00:42:38.224 --> 00:42:40.765]  You can tell us in the comments section what free gift you want.
[00:42:40.805 --> 00:42:47.187]  We just fax it over to Debbie each day, so you can order them online at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-803-4438.
[00:42:52.785 --> 00:42:53.245]  All right.
[00:42:53.845 --> 00:42:55.446]  I know we've got a bunch of phone calls here.
[00:42:55.666 --> 00:42:59.567]  Let's take a few calls, and then I'll get back into some of the news.
[00:43:00.267 --> 00:43:04.429]  Let's go ahead and speak with Osa in Texas.
[00:43:04.489 --> 00:43:05.149]  Osa, go ahead.
[00:43:06.069 --> 00:43:06.969]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[00:43:07.549 --> 00:43:07.830]  Fine.
[00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:14.732]  Oh, yeah, I just wanted to talk about how I'm extremely disappointed in the fact that now... You don't have a radio up, do you?
[00:43:15.192 --> 00:43:16.052]  Oh, no, no, no, I don't.
[00:43:17.412 --> 00:43:18.253]  Do I sound like I have a radio?
[00:43:20.113 --> 00:43:22.054]  Yeah, it sounds like somebody's singing, but go ahead.
[00:43:22.074 --> 00:43:22.454]  I'm sorry.
[00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:23.771]  Okay, no, that's okay.
[00:43:23.831 --> 00:43:45.846]  Anyway, I just wanted to quickly defend my frustration a little bit and just tell you guys how I'm frustrated about the fact that now, since more and more generals and public officials are coming out public with the corruption of the Bush administration, now the Bush administration is continually hiring criminals to run their activities, like Henry Paulson Jr.
[00:43:45.866 --> 00:43:51.450]  from Goldman Sachs, which is connected with Wall Street, just got tapped for the, what was it,
[00:43:52.816 --> 00:43:57.578]  I believe it was the Secretary of... Yeah, Secretary of the Treasury.
[00:43:58.278 --> 00:44:09.482]  Yeah, I mean, yeah, I just wanted to get... Well, there were several mainstream news articles in major papers just in the last couple weeks that pointed out that President Bush is hiring criminals.
[00:44:09.522 --> 00:44:11.683]  He hired convicted felon Admiral Poindexter.
[00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:14.412]  To run Total Information Awareness Network.
[00:44:14.933 --> 00:44:21.459]  Whenever Hayden gets in trouble for lying to Congress and illegal spying, he promotes him to CIA director.
[00:44:21.519 --> 00:44:26.464]  Bush has hired to run some of their different programs convicted felons.
[00:44:26.564 --> 00:44:27.505]  A whole bunch of them.
[00:44:27.906 --> 00:44:28.766]  No, no, no.
[00:44:29.547 --> 00:44:30.548]  You're not wrong about this.
[00:44:30.568 --> 00:44:31.609]  You're absolutely right, sir.
[00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:36.374]  He is hiring people who are known to break the law and who have been convicted felons.
[00:44:37.731 --> 00:44:43.415]  Yeah, so now when most of these guys are hired, none of them are going to come out, of course, because they're going to be, quote, with their program.
[00:44:43.875 --> 00:44:46.257]  And then, I mean, it's just going to destroy America.
[00:44:47.257 --> 00:45:02.447]  Well, when you got the Supreme Court ruling that, in one case, a prosecutor can't report frame-ups or can't report corruption, and then they get demoted and then fired over it, and the government says, yeah, you're not allowed to report corruption.
[00:45:02.467 --> 00:45:03.087]  Thanks for the call.
[00:45:03.768 --> 00:45:05.889]  I mean, that should chill everyone.
[00:45:05.929 --> 00:45:07.130]  I mean, that is chilling.
[00:45:07.907 --> 00:45:12.228]  And every month there's some new incredible ruling out of the Supreme Court.
[00:45:13.188 --> 00:45:20.470]  By the way, I always say that seven of the nine are Republican appointed.
[00:45:22.991 --> 00:45:33.093]  This is supposedly this ultra-socialist, big government promoting big brother court, but seven of the nine, it's now eight of the nine were appointed by Republicans.
[00:45:33.893 --> 00:45:37.374]  Eight of the nine appointed by Republicans.
[00:45:38.135 --> 00:45:39.076]  Republicans.
[00:45:40.436 --> 00:45:41.697]  And you look at what they're doing.
[00:45:43.118 --> 00:45:44.118]  You look at what they're doing.
[00:45:45.439 --> 00:45:47.060]  Let's talk to Jason in Maryland.
[00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:48.501]  Jason, you're on the air.
[00:45:48.561 --> 00:45:49.521]  Go ahead.
[00:45:49.561 --> 00:45:49.841]  Hi, Alex.
[00:45:50.482 --> 00:45:52.123]  I couldn't sleep last night.
[00:45:52.163 --> 00:45:55.584]  I was up studying and I was watching TV this morning.
[00:45:55.885 --> 00:45:59.547]  The Discovery Channel, I think, or Learning Channel, I can't remember.
[00:45:59.587 --> 00:46:05.270]  But I was dumbfounded when they showed the Project Paperclip.
[00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:07.271]  They had a whole show about...
[00:46:08.055 --> 00:46:10.456]  Project Paperclip, and I couldn't believe it.
[00:46:10.556 --> 00:46:20.201]  I was wondering... Yeah, there was a big article in Haratz, one in Associated Press yesterday, two separate ones, admitting our government protected Nazis and put them in at the highest levels of our government.
[00:46:20.221 --> 00:46:26.164]  Of course, that's 60-year-old news, but the mainstream media is patting themselves on the back now.
[00:46:27.205 --> 00:46:32.887]  Well, it's not 60-year-old news when we consider that George Bush Sr.
[00:46:32.927 --> 00:46:35.889]  was the head of the CIA while...
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:44.125]  A great many of those people were involved in Project Paperclip or in the CIA, and his son is running our country today.
[00:46:44.185 --> 00:46:47.247]  I think that that's today's news.
[00:46:48.007 --> 00:46:52.050]  So I was just dumbfounded that they would put that on the television.
[00:46:53.268 --> 00:46:54.649]  Well, the... Nobody's going to care.
[00:46:54.949 --> 00:46:55.430]  Exactly.
[00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:59.553]  The president's announcing himself a dictator because he says he's of the Lord.
[00:46:59.593 --> 00:47:00.394]  It must be good.
[00:47:00.814 --> 00:47:01.515]  Thanks for the call.
[00:47:01.555 --> 00:47:03.096]  I appreciate that call.
[00:47:03.116 --> 00:47:04.777]  Yeah, that's in the stack of news yesterday.
[00:47:04.797 --> 00:47:09.681]  I didn't even get to it because... No, no, I mean, I'm not saying it's old news and that it's not important.
[00:47:10.885 --> 00:47:11.546]  Here's an example.
[00:47:11.566 --> 00:47:17.871]  I saw the cover of the New York Times yesterday, and it said, oh, the dust may have caused illnesses.
[00:47:17.951 --> 00:47:19.753]  They didn't give them breathing masks.
[00:47:20.214 --> 00:47:22.856]  Oh, a whole bunch of people died.
[00:47:23.376 --> 00:47:30.523]  Statistically, you're hundreds and hundreds of times have a better chance of dying if you worked in the World Trade Center rescue effort.
[00:47:32.756 --> 00:47:32.856]  Aww.
[00:47:33.396 --> 00:47:36.358]  But it doesn't mention that they found asbestos in their lungs.
[00:47:36.438 --> 00:47:38.740]  New Scientist magazine did the study.
[00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:40.101]  New York Daily News.
[00:47:40.121 --> 00:47:42.002]  That's four-year-old news.
[00:47:42.983 --> 00:47:44.704]  Here it is in the New York Times.
[00:47:45.284 --> 00:47:48.126]  But they don't mention the really bad elements of the story.
[00:47:48.606 --> 00:47:55.751]  Or that George Bush blocked $97 million in emergency medical care in the first year after 9-11.
[00:47:56.151 --> 00:47:57.712]  The head of the EPA did the testing.
[00:47:58.093 --> 00:47:59.814]  They said, yes, the people are dead and dying.
[00:48:00.806 --> 00:48:06.570]  Most of the dogs have now died that were there sniffing out things.
[00:48:07.591 --> 00:48:09.472]  They've got all these weird nasal cancers.
[00:48:10.273 --> 00:48:13.695]  And the police and firemen aren't being given medical care.
[00:48:13.715 --> 00:48:14.676]  They're not being taken care of.
[00:48:14.736 --> 00:48:15.237]  So good!
[00:48:15.277 --> 00:48:16.117]  Enjoy your government!
[00:48:16.658 --> 00:48:17.378]  Go serve them!
[00:48:17.478 --> 00:48:18.619]  They're the deciders.
[00:48:18.679 --> 00:48:19.500]  They're the bosses.
[00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:21.241]  They're the authorities.
[00:48:21.361 --> 00:48:23.302]  They're the officials.
[00:48:23.543 --> 00:48:25.004]  Oh, they'll take good care of you.
[00:48:26.825 --> 00:48:29.527]  There was a big London Telegraph article, what, two days ago,
[00:48:31.038 --> 00:48:59.476]  With all these major universities and scientific firms that have done the long-term studies, and oh, breaking news, almost all the children that have autism have a type of genetically engineered virus embedded in their intestinal wall, and when you have that virus, you then have autism directly linked to the MMR shots, the measles, mumps, rubella.
[00:49:01.554 --> 00:49:03.275]  And then folks say, well, what's causing that?
[00:49:03.295 --> 00:49:06.978]  I've had different epidemiologists, different engineers on, genetic engineers.
[00:49:08.478 --> 00:49:09.239]  It's several things.
[00:49:09.279 --> 00:49:22.107]  The high dosages, 200 times by your third round of shots, safe level of mercury directly in the bloodstream causes massive brain damage, predominantly in the cerebral cortex.
[00:49:23.008 --> 00:49:25.029]  And literally, there are hundreds of major medical reports.
[00:49:25.089 --> 00:49:28.111]  I mean, academic, scholarly reviewed papers.
[00:49:29.904 --> 00:49:34.548]  But also, they found this virus isn't just embedding in the intestinal wall.
[00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:37.391]  It's embedding in the brain.
[00:49:39.353 --> 00:49:56.008]  And of course, they have the article a couple years ago out of the London Telegraph again about how the British government is trying to force the adoption of forced inoculation at age two of a vaccine that contains a virus that attacks the
[00:49:57.136 --> 00:50:08.969]  Respoto-receptors, not photo, that's a plant, that attacks the neuro-electrochemical receptors in the brain that pick up endorphin-type molecules.
[00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:11.612]  The opiates, the cocaines, the nicotines.
[00:50:11.673 --> 00:50:15.537]  And it said, you will not use cocaine, you will not use heroin, you will not use cigarettes.
[00:50:16.477 --> 00:50:27.339]  And then I had several top scientists on about that, and we read several scholarly review papers that said, yeah, but they'll have trouble being happy because your own endorphins won't plug in, but we can give kids drugs that'll make them feel good on top of that.
[00:50:28.479 --> 00:50:29.540]  Folks, I'm not making this up.
[00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:31.960]  A virus, and they're already doing it.
[00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:34.441]  Most people already have this.
[00:50:34.461 --> 00:50:37.421]  That's why the general public doesn't have that spark, isn't intelligent.
[00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:39.382]  Boy, you can't reach out to so many people.
[00:50:39.782 --> 00:50:40.602]  They're incapable.
[00:50:41.235 --> 00:50:47.337]  When you get an over-cooking or an over-viral bloom, you get the poor autistic children.
[00:50:48.517 --> 00:50:49.658]  They have a heyday almost.
[00:50:49.838 --> 00:50:53.399]  So it's a mercury brain-attacking virus.
[00:50:53.979 --> 00:50:55.920]  Be sure and go out and vaccinate your children.
[00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:58.961]  Let Satan literally eat their brains.
[00:51:00.828 --> 00:51:01.489]  Hello, friends.
[00:51:01.589 --> 00:51:09.113]  Alex Jones here, and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[00:51:09.293 --> 00:51:11.635]  We're expecting around 1,000 people in attendance.
[00:51:12.235 --> 00:51:21.080]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:25.122]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda.
[00:51:25.562 --> 00:51:46.353]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Tarnley, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[00:51:46.673 --> 00:51:50.415]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[00:51:50.875 --> 00:51:52.156]  Arm yourself with the truth.
[00:51:52.496 --> 00:52:00.338]  Secure your tickets today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:52:01.799 --> 00:52:04.759]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:13.962]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:52:14.282 --> 00:52:18.944]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:19.424 --> 00:52:26.151]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:52:26.552 --> 00:52:38.324]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:38.804 --> 00:52:43.266]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:52.251]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:02.423 --> 00:53:08.347]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:08.567 --> 00:53:10.829]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:53:11.029 --> 00:53:17.374]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:53:17.714 --> 00:53:18.354]  We're good to go.
[00:53:47.228 --> 00:53:50.331]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:50.492 --> 00:53:56.358]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:28.067 --> 00:54:30.608]  Listeners, you need to understand I'm not making it up.
[00:54:30.628 --> 00:54:49.638]  The British government, for two years, has been attempting to bring in new national standards that attempt to force the population to give every child in the United Kingdom an injection that actually uses a live virus to attack the brain.
[00:54:51.932 --> 00:54:52.753]  We're good to go.
[00:54:52.793 --> 00:54:53.554]  We're good to go.
[00:55:14.122 --> 00:55:16.403]  And I know it's hard to believe the government carried out 9-11.
[00:55:16.423 --> 00:55:19.344]  I know it's hard to believe they're going to turn almost every major road into a toll road.
[00:55:19.684 --> 00:55:25.247]  I know it's hard to believe that they actually are putting things in the vaccines to brain damage our children on purpose.
[00:55:26.287 --> 00:55:27.467]  You see, they've just overdone it.
[00:55:27.487 --> 00:55:31.449]  They don't mean for the 1 in 168 to have autism up from 1 in 124,000 25 years ago.
[00:55:31.469 --> 00:55:32.009]  Now I guess 26 years ago.
[00:55:32.029 --> 00:55:35.651]  With it trending to be 1 in 50 they're now talking about with the new numbers starting to come out.
[00:55:44.545 --> 00:55:45.065]  No, no, no.
[00:55:45.105 --> 00:55:51.968]  It's just that some children, especially if they're underweight or already had a lot of mercury in them from what they were eating or their mother already had a lot of mercury in them.
[00:55:53.009 --> 00:55:55.329]  But on top of it, there's all these viruses.
[00:55:55.770 --> 00:55:57.070]  And this is conclusive.
[00:55:59.871 --> 00:56:04.793]  And it's conclusive that the virus, this is mainstream news, is doing something to the brain.
[00:56:04.873 --> 00:56:13.677]  So I guess I'm the radical because I'm here on air right now telling you that if you vaccinate your children, you're totally insane.
[00:56:14.778 --> 00:56:18.060]  You know what they grow these vaccines on?
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:19.861]  You know what they produce them from?
[00:56:20.462 --> 00:56:22.603]  Dead babies, embryonic tissue.
[00:56:23.143 --> 00:56:30.748]  When you see on a vaccine that it says no animal genetics, not grown in animals, that means it wasn't grown in monkey kidneys.
[00:56:30.788 --> 00:56:32.109]  It means it wasn't grown in eggs.
[00:56:32.169 --> 00:56:33.249]  It wasn't grown in poultry.
[00:56:33.570 --> 00:56:34.610]  It wasn't grown in pork.
[00:56:35.531 --> 00:56:38.453]  That's where they grow this stuff, up in these big tanks.
[00:56:38.553 --> 00:56:38.893]  No, no, no.
[00:56:38.953 --> 00:56:40.634]  It was grown in dead babies.
[00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:54.041]  So even better, even more dangerous, because every virus that that mother had, every virus that could have gotten contaminated into those fetal tissues, it's just asking for it.
[00:56:54.482 --> 00:56:59.987]  I mean, I hope all this is accidentally happening, but the government, we know, isn't accidentally doing it.
[00:57:00.007 --> 00:57:04.331]  We've seen documents where they planned all of this by design.
[00:57:06.457 --> 00:57:11.259]  By design, my friends, we're going to end this hour and come back with Professor Stephen Jones.
[00:57:11.359 --> 00:57:14.600]  I know we have Joe and Mike and Eric and Charles and everybody.
[00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:16.960]  We will get to you in the next hour.
[00:57:18.881 --> 00:57:21.282]  Before I end this hour, time is running out.
[00:57:21.322 --> 00:57:22.302]  It's already the 7th.
[00:57:23.082 --> 00:57:24.003]  So how many days is that?
[00:57:24.023 --> 00:57:24.123]  16 days?
[00:57:25.726 --> 00:57:31.608]  ...or so until the conference starts on the 24th and 25th in downtown Los Angeles at the Sheraton.
[00:57:32.128 --> 00:57:34.609]  You can stay there or stay at any of the hotels or motels around it.
[00:57:35.189 --> 00:57:36.890]  Get your tickets now.
[00:57:37.050 --> 00:57:38.190]  It's going to be great.
[00:57:38.691 --> 00:57:42.132]  We're probably going to have over 1,000 people there.
[00:57:42.172 --> 00:57:43.572]  It's trending to be a sellout.
[00:57:44.433 --> 00:57:46.513]  And Professor Stephen Jones will be there.
[00:57:47.234 --> 00:57:49.895]  The former head of the Star Wars program, Dr. Bob Bowman, will be there.
[00:57:49.935 --> 00:57:53.356]  Ray McGovern, Chief CI Analyst, Ronald Reagan, and George Bush Sr.,
[00:57:55.106 --> 00:57:58.489]  We're going to have 9-11 survivor and hero William Rodriguez.
[00:57:58.909 --> 00:58:03.774]  I'm going to premiere my new film, Terror Storm, that is my best work yet.
[00:58:04.855 --> 00:58:06.076]  It's going to be unbelievable.
[00:58:06.837 --> 00:58:07.998]  You need to be there.
[00:58:08.018 --> 00:58:12.742]  We're going to show 9-11 eyewitness, the new cut, Dylan Avery and Loose Change.
[00:58:12.762 --> 00:58:17.226]  The crowd will be there with some new footage from Loose Change Final Edition that no one's seen yet.
[00:58:18.427 --> 00:58:19.288]  Somebody see my film.
[00:58:20.622 --> 00:58:22.624]  9-11 Eyewitness, Dylan Avery's new film.
[00:58:23.365 --> 00:58:31.732]  And, yes, we're going to premiere part of Scanner Darkly, the Keanu Reeves, Winona Ryder, Woody Harrelson, Alex Jones movie.
[00:58:32.493 --> 00:58:37.557]  So, it's going to be unlike any 9-11 conference you've ever seen.
[00:58:38.418 --> 00:58:39.318]  Get your tickets now.
[00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:45.404]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:58.804 --> 00:58:59.464]  Big Brother.
[00:59:00.104 --> 00:59:01.164]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.885 --> 00:59:03.005]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:03.625 --> 00:59:04.446]  You want answers?
[00:59:05.226 --> 00:59:06.086]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.106 --> 00:59:10.428]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.948 --> 00:59:15.089]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:26.213]  We're now into the second hour of this live Wednesday edition
[00:59:27.566 --> 00:59:31.150]  The seventh day of June 2006.
[00:59:31.550 --> 00:59:35.093]  Thank God nothing happened on 666 like so many thought it would.
[00:59:35.113 --> 00:59:40.839]  And no crazies went out there and went nuts, and the globalists didn't pull anything off because of their obsession with numerology.
[00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:45.704]  I am extremely honored to be joined for this full hour by...
[00:59:46.508 --> 00:59:50.009]  Professor Stephen Jones, he has a doctorate in physics.
[00:59:50.089 --> 01:00:01.412]  He has published scores and scores of peer-reviewed papers that have been in some of the most prestigious scientific magazines and periodicals out there.
[01:00:02.373 --> 01:00:10.155]  And he has now gotten samples from pieces of the World Trade Center steel.
[01:00:11.255 --> 01:00:11.675]  We're good to go.
[01:00:37.311 --> 01:00:49.814]  In cutting steel columns, and we look at the steel columns, you don't cut with thermite straight across, you cut at an angle so that the pillar doesn't settle on the area that wasn't melted through, so the pillars slide off.
[01:00:50.514 --> 01:01:02.457]  Now we see this, and we see so many facets that, again, every time you keep researching, it just proves the next finding, and when that happens four or five times in a row, it gets scary.
[01:01:03.132 --> 01:01:05.733]  So joining us is Professor Stephen Jones.
[01:01:06.133 --> 01:01:07.113]  We're honored to have you, sir.
[01:01:08.094 --> 01:01:08.714]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:01:08.734 --> 01:01:10.494]  It's good to talk to you.
[01:01:10.534 --> 01:01:12.055]  It's good to see you last weekend.
[01:01:12.455 --> 01:01:13.895]  You gave a great presentation.
[01:01:13.935 --> 01:01:15.336]  I was honored to introduce you.
[01:01:15.856 --> 01:01:17.296]  Well, thank you very much, Alex.
[01:01:17.596 --> 01:01:17.976]  You bet.
[01:01:17.997 --> 01:01:20.797]  Your talk was absolutely fantastic.
[01:01:20.877 --> 01:01:24.158]  In fact, I was worried, how am I going to follow this guy?
[01:01:25.719 --> 01:01:27.079]  I hadn't heard you speak before.
[01:01:27.099 --> 01:01:29.240]  You know, my talk is quite a different nature.
[01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:32.801]  I mean, in terms of, well...
[01:01:33.777 --> 01:01:35.738]  How can I compare myself to Alex Jones?
[01:01:36.439 --> 01:01:41.522]  Well, I think you blew me away with the new information that you broke at that conference.
[01:01:41.902 --> 01:01:43.403]  We did have some new information.
[01:01:43.443 --> 01:01:43.964]  That's true.
[01:01:45.084 --> 01:01:46.065]  Well, this is a short segment.
[01:01:46.085 --> 01:01:48.286]  We're going to break in a moment and come back in a long segment.
[01:01:48.486 --> 01:01:54.830]  And I'd like to just walk through how you woke up to 9-11, the research you've done, and the evidence of the thermite.
[01:01:55.571 --> 01:02:03.296]  But first off, will you, just for the listeners that don't know who you are, give us your background, some of the publications you've written for, some of the research you've done.
[01:02:04.005 --> 01:02:05.566]  Sure.
[01:02:06.447 --> 01:02:09.590]  Well, let's go back to graduate school.
[01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:12.052]  I was a graduate student in physics.
[01:02:12.652 --> 01:02:14.714]  Got my PhD from Vanderbilt.
[01:02:15.174 --> 01:02:19.818]  Did most of my research, though, at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.
[01:02:19.898 --> 01:02:24.982]  I finished up my coursework at Stanford since I was out there doing the research.
[01:02:27.784 --> 01:02:31.347]  And then I did postdoctoral work at Cornell and
[01:02:32.931 --> 01:02:35.553]  Let's see, Los Alamos National Lab.
[01:02:36.053 --> 01:02:37.694]  Oh, you know, I've been around the block a few times.
[01:02:38.074 --> 01:02:44.738]  I have a publication in Scientific American with a dear friend of mine, Johan Rafelski.
[01:02:44.998 --> 01:02:47.220]  That was back in 1987, July.
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:48.561]  You want to look that up?
[01:02:48.981 --> 01:02:52.743]  The title of our article is Cold Nuclear Fusion.
[01:02:53.844 --> 01:02:54.764]  Yes, that's correct.
[01:02:55.205 --> 01:02:56.265]  We're talking there about...
[01:02:57.754 --> 01:02:59.094]  Muon catalyzed fusion.
[01:02:59.655 --> 01:03:02.376]  It was just a lot of fun for a number of years.
[01:03:02.456 --> 01:03:10.038]  I was the principal investigator for the Department of Energy on this study of muon catalyzed fusion.
[01:03:11.158 --> 01:03:11.558]  Amazing.
[01:03:11.599 --> 01:03:13.979]  So you've headed up investigations for the government before?
[01:03:14.099 --> 01:03:14.639]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:15.760]  And now you've...
[01:03:16.471 --> 01:03:19.772]  You know, Department of Energy funded our research.
[01:03:19.832 --> 01:03:21.393]  That's right.
[01:03:21.453 --> 01:03:22.173]  I proposed it.
[01:03:22.213 --> 01:03:23.073]  They funded it.
[01:03:23.153 --> 01:03:30.596]  And now I think it's safe to say that you are heading up research for the 9-11 Truth Movement on the bizarre collapse of Tower 1, 2, and 7.
[01:03:30.636 --> 01:03:33.237]  That's a fair statement.
[01:03:33.697 --> 01:03:35.338]  Working with others, of course, but yeah.
[01:03:36.184 --> 01:03:38.487]  Professor, we're going to be right back after this quick three-minute break.
[01:03:38.507 --> 01:03:39.729]  Get yourself a glass of water.
[01:03:39.769 --> 01:03:49.243]  We'll plunge right into the earth-shattering, earth-quaking research he's done that continues to be verified at every step.
[01:03:49.403 --> 01:03:52.087]  It is the hair on the back of my neck standing up.
[01:03:53.028 --> 01:04:01.274]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here, and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[01:04:01.474 --> 01:04:03.816]  We're expecting around 1,000 people in attendance.
[01:04:04.417 --> 01:04:13.264]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[01:04:13.784 --> 01:04:17.287]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda.
[01:04:17.747 --> 01:04:38.545]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Turnbull, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[01:04:38.865 --> 01:04:42.608]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[01:04:43.068 --> 01:04:44.329]  Arm yourself with the truth.

[01:06:36.323 --> 01:06:36.863]  Box 281, Wildwood, PA 15091.
[01:06:53.312 --> 01:06:58.975]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:02.577 --> 01:07:07.839]  Professor Stephen Jones holds several degrees from prestigious universities.
[01:07:07.899 --> 01:07:09.320]  He's a doctor of physics.
[01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:12.701]  He's led investigations for the U.S.
[01:07:12.741 --> 01:07:18.284]  government for different bodies into different scientific developments and phenomenon.
[01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:20.411]  We're good to go.
[01:07:20.491 --> 01:07:21.231]  We're good to go.
[01:07:49.344 --> 01:07:59.690]  By the rules of science, you would expect that somewhere you would start disproving the hypothesis, but it only strengthens it and opens out into whole other areas.
[01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:04.453]  And the official story is completely unscientific and a fraud and a lie.
[01:08:05.513 --> 01:08:14.879]  Professor Jones, let's just start off with the scientific method and some of the things we discussed in that interview, because you said as you investigated this, you expected to
[01:08:15.339 --> 01:08:15.439]  Sure.
[01:08:15.459 --> 01:08:17.881]  Well, in a nutshell, using the scientific method, we...
[01:08:42.505 --> 01:08:56.754]  Assemble all the facts that we can get our hands on, all the observations, photos, materials for analyses, everything we can find that would relate to the subject that we can possibly acquire.
[01:08:56.794 --> 01:09:08.321]  And then we try to find an explanation coming out of the facts and based on and consistent with all the facts, not just some small subset of the facts.
[01:09:09.542 --> 01:09:09.682]  And
[01:09:11.521 --> 01:09:18.943]  That's the crucial difference between the scientific method, where we assemble facts and then develop an explanation.
[01:09:19.743 --> 01:09:34.047]  And frankly, what we saw, as I look back to 9-11, I mean, as those buildings came down, people were already speculating and then very quickly stating, this is Al-Qaeda solely responsible.
[01:09:35.668 --> 01:09:39.669]  And what facts can we find to support that
[01:09:41.118 --> 01:09:42.579]  Foregone conclusion.
[01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:44.261]  That's not science at all.
[01:09:44.821 --> 01:10:04.217]  So there's a big distinction there, incorporating all the facts as opposed to starting out with a conclusion and then just finding what facts you have to support your conclusion, which is called pathological science, by the way.
[01:10:05.111 --> 01:10:06.371]  Yes, pathological science.
[01:10:06.431 --> 01:10:07.832]  You did the opposite.
[01:10:08.372 --> 01:10:16.794]  Go into, once you started questioning, why did you first question the collapse, and then once you began to do research, what did you notice?
[01:10:16.814 --> 01:10:18.254]  And then let's go right into the thermite.
[01:10:18.874 --> 01:10:19.134]  Okay.
[01:10:19.874 --> 01:10:31.657]  Well, you know, I had several nudges along the way from friends, not scientists in this case, but friends who said, you know, you really ought to look into the
[01:10:32.841 --> 01:10:35.043]  9-11 events and see what you think.
[01:10:35.063 --> 01:10:43.168]  There's a friend of mine, Steve, that's his name too, but he kept kicking me in the pants to look at it.
[01:10:44.249 --> 01:10:50.853]  I will say he finally showed me a certain DVD, but I found it unconvincing.
[01:10:51.133 --> 01:10:59.319]  I mean, that's too bad because it kind of turned me off to the study because it had so many speculations without evidence, you know,
[01:10:59.847 --> 01:11:00.808]  That's what we're talking about.
[01:11:01.208 --> 01:11:04.550]  Scientists like to start with the facts and then go from there.
[01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:10.273]  And this one was just filled with what I would call speculations without much supporting evidence.
[01:11:11.253 --> 01:11:15.295]  But I just kept receiving these nudges.
[01:11:16.436 --> 01:11:18.557]  Finally, I got on the web.
[01:11:21.038 --> 01:11:27.522]  Fortunately, I got to... I'll mention WTC7.net because that's where I...
[01:11:28.672 --> 01:11:31.934]  Finally, you know, sat down and started looking hard.
[01:11:32.635 --> 01:11:41.681]  And the nice thing about Hoffman's site here and his coworkers is that they show evidence and then they provide references.
[01:11:41.761 --> 01:11:50.767]  So now I'm going and checking these references to make sure these guys are telling the story straight and looking at the evidence myself.
[01:11:51.027 --> 01:11:54.470]  And when I saw Building 7 collapse, this is the first time I saw it.
[01:11:54.490 --> 01:11:55.010]  You know, that was...
[01:11:56.707 --> 01:11:57.447]  The first part of 2005.
[01:11:57.487 --> 01:12:03.631]  I mean, that's how long it took me to finally get into the serious research here.
[01:12:05.272 --> 01:12:10.054]  When I saw the collapse of Building 7, man, I said to myself, that is strange.
[01:12:10.074 --> 01:12:11.035]  I'd never seen it before.
[01:12:11.795 --> 01:12:18.839]  Between 2001, the collapse that afternoon, late afternoon, it was never hit by a jet, but here it comes straight down.
[01:12:19.648 --> 01:12:24.312]  I don't see any raging inferno in this building, but I do see it fall straight down.
[01:12:24.932 --> 01:12:28.515]  And pretty quick with students, we measured the rate of fall.
[01:12:28.655 --> 01:12:35.801]  I teach Newtonian mechanics and was teaching it at that time.
[01:12:36.462 --> 01:12:44.088]  Anyway, we looked at the free fall compared to the fall of Building 7, and they're almost the same, 6.5 seconds.
[01:12:46.754 --> 01:12:55.380]  The time for the collapse of Building 7 compared with 6.0 seconds for an apple falling in a vacuum.
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:57.081]  Now we're talking about the corner of the Building 7.
[01:12:58.222 --> 01:13:00.463]  When that starts to move, we start our clock.
[01:13:00.663 --> 01:13:02.645]  We did a fairly detailed analysis of it.
[01:13:04.286 --> 01:13:05.867]  So that's really how I got into it.
[01:13:07.528 --> 01:13:12.071]  And, you know, it took several nudges, and I assume that's true of other people too, so...
[01:13:13.248 --> 01:13:14.751]  As we give them these nudges.
[01:13:14.791 --> 01:13:16.475]  We're doing that right now on the radio.
[01:13:17.136 --> 01:13:22.548]  Well, you don't want to believe it, but we have to because we've got an out-of-control, dangerous group
[01:13:23.195 --> 01:13:23.475]  I think so.
[01:13:45.954 --> 01:13:46.274]  Yeah, so the...
[01:14:15.046 --> 01:14:15.326]  I think so.
[01:14:38.921 --> 01:14:42.123]  We would like to get all the videos from NIST.
[01:14:43.284 --> 01:14:48.947]  They brag about having 300 hours of videos and thousands of photographs.
[01:14:48.987 --> 01:14:52.089]  Well, we would appreciate it if they would release those data.
[01:14:52.829 --> 01:14:55.791]  If there's nothing to hide, they shouldn't hide it.
[01:14:56.572 --> 01:15:02.755]  But anyway, we did come across this, and as I looked at that, I said, that is extremely interesting.
[01:15:03.596 --> 01:15:06.978]  I mean, I'd heard about it, but it took a while for the group to...
[01:15:08.224 --> 01:15:10.266]  Trace down this video evidence.
[01:15:10.306 --> 01:15:23.955]  This is an amateur videographer, a couple of them actually, showing and capturing this event, this very anomalous activity, this molten metal flowing out of the building.
[01:15:23.975 --> 01:15:30.579]  As soon as I saw it, I knew it was not aluminum because I had worked with molten aluminum before.
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:37.744]  And molten liquid aluminum has the property that it's silvery, but rather like aluminum foil.
[01:15:38.826 --> 01:15:43.769]  You know, at all temperatures in daylight conditions.
[01:15:45.411 --> 01:15:48.072]  And so here's this yellow hot metal.
[01:15:48.132 --> 01:15:49.513]  I knew that couldn't be aluminum.
[01:15:49.834 --> 01:15:55.237]  Look, we did some checking, the scholars group, in the NIST report.
[01:15:55.257 --> 01:16:03.503]  It is in Appendix H. There's some discussion of this, and they say just simply it's probably aluminum, you know.
[01:16:04.833 --> 01:16:06.194]  Well, I knew that wasn't right.
[01:16:06.394 --> 01:16:09.816]  Well, I would just also add, of course, aluminum melts at a lower temperature.
[01:16:09.836 --> 01:16:11.037]  That's another point.
[01:16:11.998 --> 01:16:14.079]  But still not at the 1,200 degrees.
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:20.103]  And when you look at the buildings, the fires are very low, almost burn out.
[01:16:20.504 --> 01:16:27.989]  Right before collapse, suddenly, this yellow-orange-ish lava, basically, starts pouring out of the sides.
[01:16:28.629 --> 01:16:29.570]  But you went further.
[01:16:29.670 --> 01:16:32.852]  You were able to actually get a hold of some of that.
[01:16:33.152 --> 01:16:34.333]  Also, aluminum...
[01:16:35.132 --> 01:16:38.695]  Wouldn't stay at 2,500 degrees for several months.
[01:16:38.995 --> 01:16:43.798]  We have giant pools of molten metal down in the basement.
[01:16:43.858 --> 01:16:46.840]  So that's what first got you looking at this, right?
[01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:47.781]  That's true.
[01:16:48.301 --> 01:16:55.346]  It's the pools of molten metal and photographed by Frank Seleccia of New York.
[01:16:55.386 --> 01:17:00.429]  Just a fantastic photo that he had in his possession that shows this thing.
[01:17:02.538 --> 01:17:09.470]  ...claw pulling this yellow hot metal out of the rubble pile.
[01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:10.792]  I mean, to have it that hot...
[01:17:13.426 --> 01:17:25.715]  Yeah, weeks and weeks after you've got the big shovel in there, and it just picks up a huge mass of white hot, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:17:25.895 --> 01:17:32.760]  Folks, for those that don't know, it is hard, even with a conventional furnace, to get steel white hot.
[01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:35.362]  And this stuff is white hot.
[01:17:36.503 --> 01:17:36.683]  Yeah.
[01:17:37.003 --> 01:17:39.405]  At this stage, I would say it looks yellow.
[01:17:40.293 --> 01:17:46.576]  But earlier on, you know, thermite produces molten iron at white hot.
[01:17:46.676 --> 01:17:51.899]  So it's... Well, look at the photo around the edges, Doctor.
[01:17:52.019 --> 01:17:54.060]  It's yellow, but I do see some white in that photo.
[01:17:54.541 --> 01:17:54.881]  Okay.
[01:17:56.142 --> 01:17:58.843]  I'm looking at it, and I grant there's a little white there on the bottom.
[01:17:59.583 --> 01:18:00.844]  You know, this is the thing.
[01:18:00.864 --> 01:18:07.988]  There's so much evidence that... I mean, I've worked in other fields where the evidence is...
[01:18:09.028 --> 01:18:09.729]  Hard to come by.
[01:18:09.789 --> 01:18:12.911]  It's a little hard to come by here for some reason.
[01:18:13.831 --> 01:18:22.237]  But at the same time, when we do get the evidence, it just starts fitting together, pointing to the use of thermite.
[01:18:22.277 --> 01:18:26.740]  Thermite is what is capable of producing these white hot temperatures.
[01:18:28.461 --> 01:18:32.424]  When we get back from this break, you have done the groundbreaking test.
[01:18:32.444 --> 01:18:33.665]  They were able to get samples.
[01:18:34.517 --> 01:18:35.979]  I don't know if we can tell the public this.
[01:18:36.039 --> 01:18:38.161]  I guarantee you the feds are listening to Jones to begin with.
[01:18:38.202 --> 01:18:39.123]  They know where they got it.
[01:18:39.683 --> 01:18:41.485]  But we'll see if he wants to talk about it.
[01:18:42.266 --> 01:18:43.448]  And they've done the test.
[01:18:43.468 --> 01:18:46.011]  They've had other scientists oversee the test.
[01:18:46.271 --> 01:18:49.435]  It is so conclusive it's going to blow you away.
[01:18:49.835 --> 01:18:51.137]  Stay with us, Dr. Jones.
[01:18:53.934 --> 01:18:57.215]  Do you remember when you could eat most anything and not worry about it?
[01:18:57.715 --> 01:18:59.876]  Or maybe weight management has always been a problem.
[01:19:00.396 --> 01:19:05.757]  Are you frustrated, burned out, and tired of fad diets and marketing gimmicks that don't really work?

[01:19:53.945 --> 01:19:59.272]  Here it is, folks, the 2006 Red Book, the most comprehensive edition ever published.
[01:20:00.013 --> 01:20:03.678]  Midas Resources believes our clients should be as informed as possible.
[01:20:04.459 --> 01:20:05.921]  It includes the history of U.S.
[01:20:05.981 --> 01:20:12.329]  coins, the actual mintages, the grading standards, learn the stability of real money.
[01:20:12.688 --> 01:20:13.268]  We're good to go.
[01:20:42.176 --> 01:20:42.236]  1-800-686-2237
[01:20:53.169 --> 01:20:56.430]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:20:56.490 --> 01:21:00.671]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:21:00.912 --> 01:21:03.712]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:21:03.892 --> 01:21:06.293]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:21:06.493 --> 01:21:15.136]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:21:15.316 --> 01:21:16.677]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:21:16.877 --> 01:21:20.998]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:21:20.998 --> 01:21:21.559]  We're good to go.
[01:21:40.459 --> 01:21:42.940]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:44.721]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[01:21:44.801 --> 01:21:51.845]  The best kept secret in the world today is that now it is possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:14.174]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed, Inc.'
[01:22:14.134 --> 01:22:15.615]  's patented methodology.
[01:22:16.356 --> 01:22:27.186]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[01:22:27.806 --> 01:22:30.328]  Star War technology at its best.

[01:22:36.710 --> 01:22:40.031]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:22:40.052 --> 01:22:43.393]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:05.093 --> 01:23:05.633]  Welcome back.
[01:23:05.673 --> 01:23:08.595]  Professor Stephen E. Jones, Doctor of Physics, joins us.
[01:23:09.055 --> 01:23:18.301]  If you go to Infowars.com, right underneath his picture in today's guest section, you can link through to the detailed paper he has written.
[01:23:18.421 --> 01:23:24.225]  It's filled with video clips and photos and documents there for you to peruse his research.
[01:23:24.807 --> 01:23:25.488]  Did I specify at which...
[01:23:52.256 --> 01:23:55.718]  Particular memorial park this was.
[01:23:55.878 --> 01:23:56.418]  No, you didn't.
[01:23:56.779 --> 01:23:57.299]  No, you didn't.
[01:23:57.699 --> 01:23:58.400]  Let's leave it in.
[01:23:58.680 --> 01:23:59.720]  Okay, guys, you heard it.
[01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:03.863]  Because I don't want to put anybody in jeopardy.
[01:24:04.643 --> 01:24:07.605]  Because, look, there's hundreds of these memorial parks.
[01:24:08.405 --> 01:24:11.607]  This is an interesting story, I think, Alex, and I'm glad you brought that up.
[01:24:11.827 --> 01:24:16.350]  See, when my paper came out last fall, October, November there,
[01:24:17.313 --> 01:24:22.594]  I made comments that, you know, we're asking for people's help in gathering data.
[01:24:22.734 --> 01:24:27.755]  We're not getting much help out of NIST, frankly, and others.
[01:24:28.856 --> 01:24:32.156]  So we are asking people to help gather up data.
[01:24:32.436 --> 01:24:38.758]  And pretty quick, here's the story without revealing the precise location.
[01:24:40.718 --> 01:24:43.819]  It turns out that there are a number of places
[01:24:44.869 --> 01:24:58.561]  In this country, and I've learned other countries as well, where there are samples of the World Trade Center steel erected in a type of memorial, like a peace park or a memorial park for 9-11.
[01:25:00.062 --> 01:25:09.250]  Now, what's interesting is that then that means there's steel that can be looked at and observed.
[01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:12.812]  In this one case, the steel was sent to a
[01:25:14.252 --> 01:25:14.652]  Place.
[01:25:16.854 --> 01:25:25.661]  And the welder who's putting it together, so he's making a monument out of this, trying to make it stand up with these pieces of steel.
[01:25:26.862 --> 01:25:39.132]  And it was a volunteer, first of all, that went to Ground Zero, helped out there, and then was able to arrange for these steel members to be erected in his city as a memorial.
[01:25:39.904 --> 01:25:42.125]  And I thought that was great of him to do that.
[01:25:42.706 --> 01:25:57.054]  The welder's wife looked at the steel, and she noticed that clinging to the steel was a bunch of dirt and I don't know if she noticed the molten metal, but she noticed this dirt and stuff clinging to the steel.
[01:25:57.114 --> 01:26:08.401]  Now it's going to be put outside, and she just had this thought, I'm going to take this material off the steel because it's going to be in the weather and it could easily be washed away and so on.
[01:26:09.782 --> 01:26:14.325]  She gathered it up and put it in a plastic container.
[01:26:14.826 --> 01:26:19.229]  When my paper came out, she sent me not all, but some of this material.
[01:26:19.569 --> 01:26:20.650]  That's quite a large quantity.
[01:26:21.210 --> 01:26:25.013]  In this material, there are samples of molten metal.
[01:26:26.054 --> 01:26:30.157]  Now that's one, and then I have another avenue too, but
[01:26:32.529 --> 01:26:33.469]  I don't know quite.
[01:26:33.769 --> 01:26:40.573]  This was a fellow working for 9-11 Truth that talked to people in New York and was able to get another sample.
[01:26:41.093 --> 01:26:44.635]  Now, to be specific, the feds took some of it away to warehouses.
[01:26:44.775 --> 01:26:49.098]  The lion's share was sent to China and South Korea under guard.
[01:26:49.158 --> 01:26:51.259]  No one was allowed to take photos or get near it.
[01:26:51.279 --> 01:26:52.279]  They acted very suspicious.
[01:26:52.339 --> 01:27:00.644]  But then, for propaganda uses, about a year later, they allowed some of the steel to be released, to be erected, never thinking that we would go test it.
[01:27:01.865 --> 01:27:09.555]  And so you see the video of this molten steel pouring out the exact signature you've seen before, and so you think, well, I need to get some to test it.
[01:27:09.575 --> 01:27:11.859]  And you said it looked like thermite.
[01:27:11.899 --> 01:27:17.286]  Thermite could create the heat we'd see to keep it hot for four or five weeks down on the ground after it collapsed.
[01:27:17.746 --> 01:27:21.668]  And sure enough, when you did the test, it wasn't just thermite.
[01:27:21.768 --> 01:27:30.551]  It was the exact derivatives, byproducts of the ignition that you would see with the specific type used for cutting.
[01:27:30.791 --> 01:27:31.991]  Why don't you tell us about it?
[01:27:33.372 --> 01:27:36.713]  Yeah, so I was rather surprised when we did the analysis.
[01:27:36.773 --> 01:27:42.075]  Now, as I emphasized to you when we talked, it was that Monday, Alex,
[01:27:43.047 --> 01:27:43.747]  Or Sunday.
[01:27:43.787 --> 01:27:49.029]  But anyway, this is still, the quantitative result is preliminary.
[01:27:49.049 --> 01:27:57.051]  I mean, we've determined that this is primarily iron, which is what you expect from the thermite reaction.
[01:27:57.711 --> 01:27:58.991]  It produces molten iron.
[01:28:00.311 --> 01:28:02.252]  What really surprised me, and I
[01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:07.743]  I mean, I should have thought of this, but it was the amount of sulfur.
[01:28:07.783 --> 01:28:15.148]  I mean, there's a clear signature for sulfur in the sample that we've been analyzing.
[01:28:16.309 --> 01:28:27.656]  And sulfur added to thermite, it's called thermate, call it by that technical name, thermate, and that is used specifically to cut through steel.
[01:28:28.296 --> 01:28:31.999]  I mean, when you put sulfur in thermite, whammo, that...
[01:28:32.765 --> 01:28:34.286]  Like a hot knife through butter.
[01:28:34.586 --> 01:28:35.087]  Stay there.
[01:28:35.107 --> 01:28:37.668]  We'll have plenty of time to get into this when we get back.
[01:28:38.108 --> 01:28:40.130]  This is so important, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:43.392 --> 01:28:44.312]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.793 --> 01:28:46.394]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.314 --> 01:28:49.996]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.476 --> 01:28:59.798]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:00.158 --> 01:29:04.839]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:29:05.159 --> 01:29:12.842]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:13.122 --> 01:29:19.964]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:20.184 --> 01:29:21.564]  There are no side effects.
[01:29:21.684 --> 01:29:22.244]  We're good to go.
[01:29:45.962 --> 01:29:46.924]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:29:53.843 --> 01:29:58.786]  Now you can bring Berkey purification power anywhere with the Sport Berkey filtration bottle.
[01:29:59.087 --> 01:30:01.348]  Ideal for sporting games, camping, or boating.
[01:30:01.408 --> 01:30:04.550]  Or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[01:30:04.590 --> 01:30:08.873]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[01:30:09.213 --> 01:30:12.235]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[01:30:12.536 --> 01:30:15.978]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[01:30:16.298 --> 01:30:25.640]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkeys patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[01:30:25.900 --> 01:30:29.401]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[01:30:53.723 --> 01:30:56.065]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:30:56.305 --> 01:30:58.347]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:30:58.487 --> 01:31:05.533]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[01:31:05.813 --> 01:31:14.380]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:19.404]  Now for the first time, Calbin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.

[01:31:41.699 --> 01:31:44.079]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[01:32:04.475 --> 01:32:07.857]  Professor Stephen E. Jones is our guest, doctor of physics.
[01:32:10.038 --> 01:32:12.999]  And clearly the buildings are brought down by controlled demolition.
[01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:17.482]  The firefighters, the police, the evidence, the underwriting laboratories.
[01:32:18.494 --> 01:32:20.175]  All of the evidence shows that.
[01:32:20.215 --> 01:32:27.359]  We know the official story is impossible, so we set about scientifically to come up with a hypothesis and then to test that.
[01:32:27.819 --> 01:32:32.781]  And every step of the way, we see evidence that thermite was used.
[01:32:32.861 --> 01:32:40.645]  And specifically, Professor Jones just doesn't find evidence of thermite, the byproducts of thermite, that you wouldn't find unless it was thermite.
[01:32:40.925 --> 01:32:46.028]  They find the byproducts of thermate, which is the specific thermite mix that
[01:32:46.428 --> 01:32:46.668]  Sure.
[01:32:46.688 --> 01:32:50.069]  You see, with thermite added to... I'm sorry, sulfur added to thermite, what happens is that...
[01:33:06.664 --> 01:33:20.228]  The heat of the thermite already heats up the steel, and then with the sulfur present, the sulfur is able to get into the steel, actually into cracks and intergranular spaces in the steel.
[01:33:20.968 --> 01:33:24.049]  And it lowers the melting temperature of the steel.
[01:33:24.069 --> 01:33:26.790]  Let me give you the numbers in Fahrenheit.
[01:33:26.810 --> 01:33:31.071]  Structural steel melts at about 2750 Fahrenheit.
[01:33:31.091 --> 01:33:32.832]  By the way, that's way above what the
[01:33:33.567 --> 01:33:35.248]  I don't know if you've ever had a... I'm pausing there.
[01:33:35.268 --> 01:33:35.968]  If you've ever had a...
[01:33:49.764 --> 01:33:53.686]  Wood-burning stove, but you've never had that puppy melt on you, I dare say.
[01:33:54.986 --> 01:33:59.148]  So anyway, even if you put jet fuel in there, it's not going to melt.
[01:33:59.409 --> 01:34:16.076]  So anyway, let's come from melting at about 2750 Fahrenheit, and you bring that right down to, with sulfur added, now you can get the steel to melt at a lower temperature, around 1600 Fahrenheit.
[01:34:18.024 --> 01:34:21.427]  So, it's like putting salt on ice.
[01:34:22.148 --> 01:34:23.229]  Now the ice will melt.
[01:34:23.970 --> 01:34:31.317]  I mean, say it's 20 degrees outside, and you have this frozen ice on your sidewalk.
[01:34:31.337 --> 01:34:33.419]  Well, if you sprinkle salt on that, it'll melt it.
[01:34:34.700 --> 01:34:37.823]  And the same thing happens with steel.
[01:34:38.584 --> 01:34:42.408]  When you add sulfur to it, it brings that melting temperature right down.
[01:34:43.186 --> 01:34:53.651]  And therefore, it allows you to, with the hot molten iron from thermite, it just slices through the steel very rapidly in seconds.
[01:34:53.811 --> 01:34:54.612]  It's well known.
[01:34:54.692 --> 01:34:57.373]  I mean, I'm not revealing any secrets here.
[01:34:57.733 --> 01:35:00.435]  I just did a Google search during the break.
[01:35:01.335 --> 01:35:04.937]  Thermate, which is sulfur primarily, is the main ingredient.
[01:35:05.817 --> 01:35:08.218]  Sulfur and potassium permanganate added to thermite, 893 hits.
[01:35:08.258 --> 01:35:08.679]  Thermite
[01:35:11.696 --> 01:35:21.980]  I got 376,000 hits, of which Prison Planet was right up there on the top, by the way.
[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:24.521]  So, yeah, I mean, this is not a state secret.
[01:35:24.541 --> 01:35:27.642]  In fact, you can buy this stuff, Thermite, you can buy on eBay.
[01:35:27.662 --> 01:35:32.604]  I mean, I had recently a fellow say, oh, don't talk about, this is the...
[01:35:34.559 --> 01:35:37.125]  A mechanical engineer has given me some gossip.
[01:35:37.165 --> 01:35:40.211]  He's saying, oh, don't you dare talk about thermites.
[01:35:40.231 --> 01:35:44.240]  You're telling the terrorists how to... I'm saying, you know, excuse me...
[01:35:45.498 --> 01:35:47.240]  Thermite is extremely well known.
[01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:55.046]  I'm not trying to reveal any secrets here, but we're trying to find out what really happened and who the terrorists are, for heaven's sake.
[01:35:55.066 --> 01:35:56.407]  Well, I would just ignore that idiot.
[01:35:57.008 --> 01:36:08.258]  Now, Professor, specifically, I want to go over what you found in the molten globulins that were adhering to the side of these beams.
[01:36:09.058 --> 01:36:13.860]  Specifically, what were the byproducts, and what does that, because again, it wasn't just the byproduct.
[01:36:14.140 --> 01:36:17.961]  In your paper, you report the new adenomy vat, it was new evidence.
[01:36:18.282 --> 01:36:19.522]  It wasn't just thermite.
[01:36:20.002 --> 01:36:21.463]  You had to then go, what is this?
[01:36:21.863 --> 01:36:24.584]  And you discovered it was specifically what you'd find with thermate.
[01:36:25.224 --> 01:36:25.504]  Right.
[01:36:26.204 --> 01:36:35.448]  Yeah, and sulfur in abundance, and again, I emphasize we'll have this quantitative analysis soon, but this takes time to be
[01:36:37.455 --> 01:36:39.096]  Quantitative on these analyses.
[01:36:39.116 --> 01:36:39.796]  Peer-reviewed.
[01:36:39.816 --> 01:36:58.729]  In fact, without giving out names, probably you told us more for our report, but without giving out too many names until later, you worked with several other physicists, professors, and you specifically, one of your areas of study is going back and reconstructing things in archaeological ways.
[01:36:58.749 --> 01:37:04.373]  So you are the specific discipline of the whole field of physicists to look at this.
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:05.460]  Right.
[01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:12.003]  This field is called archaeometry, in which I've taught courses in archaeometry at the graduate level.
[01:37:12.844 --> 01:37:21.328]  And that's, in essence, physics methods, advanced scientific methods applied to the study of archaeology.
[01:37:21.348 --> 01:37:22.728]  And so basically that's what we're doing here.
[01:37:23.349 --> 01:37:28.971]  We're trying to figure out what happened, just like archaeologists do, at a very interesting site.
[01:37:29.432 --> 01:37:31.793]  In this case, we're studying something that happened just...
[01:37:33.138 --> 01:37:34.259]  Four or five years ago.
[01:37:34.339 --> 01:37:48.085]  Well, that's who crime labs a lot of times in big murder cases hire is archaeologists or physicists in your persuasion because the crime labs aren't advanced enough in this study to be able to specifically get answers, but you guys are.
[01:37:48.585 --> 01:37:48.805]  Right.
[01:37:49.105 --> 01:37:51.866]  Listen, I need to interject one thing that occurred to me.
[01:37:53.507 --> 01:37:55.548]  In archaeology in general...
[01:37:56.078 --> 01:38:04.102]  In archaeometry in particular, we are very careful about what's called the provenience of materials that we analyze.
[01:38:05.343 --> 01:38:09.726]  In this case, a lot of the evidence has been destroyed.
[01:38:09.826 --> 01:38:15.809]  As you mentioned, it's shipped off, literally melted in Asia for recycling.
[01:38:17.150 --> 01:38:24.774]  But I mentioned the importance of these peace parks and memorial parks around the world that have steel samples now.
[01:38:25.622 --> 01:38:34.965]  I don't want people to run out and start scraping these, because we have to exercise some care.
[01:38:35.445 --> 01:38:43.867]  If people find a Peace Park, I'm very interested in more samples, but first please take photos.
[01:38:44.890 --> 01:38:46.511]  In fact, do that just as soon as you can.
[01:38:47.612 --> 01:38:49.333]  Document it like a crime scene.
[01:38:49.373 --> 01:39:00.059]  Take photos, get permission, evidence it out, document in front of witnesses that you removed it properly, didn't contaminate it with other... I wouldn't even remove it at this stage.
[01:39:00.099 --> 01:39:13.027]  In other words, just photograph it as quick as you can so that we, if somebody else, whoever that might be, comes along and scrapes off the globs of molten metal, at least you've got pictures that it was there.
[01:39:13.067 --> 01:39:14.348]  But hopefully that wouldn't happen.
[01:39:14.881 --> 01:39:22.023]  So anyway, start with photographs, and if you could send those to me or, well, it's the Scholars for 9-11 Truth group.
[01:39:23.343 --> 01:39:31.226]  But anyway, if you send those to me, we can then think about and get the permissions to get that molten metal analyzed.
[01:39:31.506 --> 01:39:31.986]  Exactly.
[01:39:32.006 --> 01:39:38.528]  We can analyze it decently in situ.
[01:39:38.648 --> 01:39:42.789]  It's a non-destructive analysis using a portable X-ray fluorescence device.
[01:39:43.334 --> 01:39:54.754]  We can actually travel to, I don't know, Canada, say, and Peace Park, and you've got these photos of this gray-black molten metal adhering to the steel beam.
[01:39:54.794 --> 01:39:55.756]  We want to take a look at it.
[01:39:56.744 --> 01:40:02.906]  We could just go and analyze it right there, and then after that, we'd already have data, you see.
[01:40:02.926 --> 01:40:05.186]  But you did prove conclusively it's not aluminum, folks.
[01:40:05.246 --> 01:40:10.068]  It's iron, the byproduct of melted steel, mixed with the byproducts of thermite.
[01:40:10.448 --> 01:40:14.009]  Not just thermite, the specific type used and patented.
[01:40:14.489 --> 01:40:15.050]  We're good to go.
[01:40:43.010 --> 01:40:44.011]  That's exactly right.
[01:40:44.312 --> 01:40:52.180]  Because if you cut it straight across, you know, horizontally, then, of course, the upper beam would just rest still on the lower beam.
[01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:58.688]  But by cutting it at about a 45-degree angle, then the support for the upper portion is gone.
[01:40:58.728 --> 01:41:02.332]  You've weakened the building every time you cut a column that way.
[01:41:02.572 --> 01:41:04.174]  I mean, you've...
[01:41:04.983 --> 01:41:11.887]  This is, in fact, the routine in demolitions is to pre-weaken the building before you set off explosives.
[01:41:11.907 --> 01:41:16.430]  And you go in, and down low, you cut the columns in this fashion.
[01:41:17.231 --> 01:41:25.396]  But they didn't have time on this, so along with the clear chemical explosives, and those were clearly in there, folks, they went ahead and jacketed columns with the thermate.
[01:41:26.517 --> 01:41:28.018]  That's sure what it appears.
[01:41:28.118 --> 01:41:30.679]  I mean, the evidence is just building and building.
[01:41:30.699 --> 01:41:31.720]  Yeah.
[01:41:32.379 --> 01:41:37.580]  And, you know, let me give credit to one of the guys, Robert, in the Scholars Group.
[01:41:37.620 --> 01:41:43.501]  He found a patent that goes back to the 1990s, which shows a cylinder.
[01:41:43.521 --> 01:41:50.063]  And in this cylinder, if you can imagine, it's got a groove along one edge the long way.
[01:41:51.483 --> 01:41:56.504]  And you pack the cylinder with thermate or thermite.
[01:41:57.268 --> 01:42:05.072]  And then it's specifically stated to be used as a cutting device based on thermite.
[01:42:05.913 --> 01:42:18.720]  So you put your thermite in there, and then as you ignite that thermite, which can be done with a radio signal, then the molten iron shoots out through this groove in a line.
[01:42:19.460 --> 01:42:23.142]  I mean, that is an enormously effective way to cut through
[01:42:34.891 --> 01:42:39.514]  So, right before the towers collapse, it's also key that this didn't happen right when the planes crashed.
[01:42:39.534 --> 01:42:40.974]  The fires have almost burned out.
[01:42:41.415 --> 01:42:43.376]  The people are standing in the wounds of the building.
[01:42:43.416 --> 01:42:44.816]  It's not even melting their flesh.
[01:42:45.256 --> 01:42:48.278]  But then just a few feet away from them, you will have...
[01:42:48.958 --> 01:42:57.740]  Basically white lava or yellow lava metal, molten steel, pouring out, and then you have the exact thermite reaction.
[01:42:57.780 --> 01:43:02.601]  We forgot that part, and you guys have done the laboratory test right there with other scientists overseeing.
[01:43:02.621 --> 01:43:04.421]  It usually can be peer-reviewed.
[01:43:04.721 --> 01:43:08.362]  You see that exact same type of thermite smoke coming off of it.
[01:43:08.382 --> 01:43:09.082]  Can you talk about that?
[01:43:10.523 --> 01:43:10.743]  Sure.
[01:43:11.263 --> 01:43:12.683]  You'll have to wait a minute.
[01:43:12.703 --> 01:43:15.364]  I've just had some students come by and tell them to wait.
[01:43:15.424 --> 01:43:16.044]  That's okay.
[01:43:17.826 --> 01:43:19.207]  We appreciate you giving us your lunch.
[01:43:19.627 --> 01:43:22.149]  Yeah, so we're talking about the ash here.
[01:43:22.169 --> 01:43:28.054]  And, yeah, in fact, let me back up just a moment, Alex.
[01:43:28.114 --> 01:43:34.819]  We've done experiments now, I and some other professors here, with thermite.
[01:43:34.939 --> 01:43:37.501]  It's kind of fun to play with, to tell you the truth.
[01:43:37.982 --> 01:43:39.042]  But it can hazard us.
[01:43:39.082 --> 01:43:42.525]  And, again, I have to emphasize, you know, be careful with this stuff.
[01:43:42.865 --> 01:43:44.587]  Heck, you can buy it on eBay, so I'm afraid...
[01:43:45.288 --> 01:43:49.929]  That the truth is out, you know, about how fun this stuff is.
[01:43:49.969 --> 01:43:52.690]  And it's shown in chemistry classes all over the place.
[01:43:52.970 --> 01:43:54.411]  Professor Jones, stop worrying.
[01:43:54.811 --> 01:43:58.852]  I think they've got like four or five shows on Discovery where the whole show is about thermite.
[01:43:59.272 --> 01:43:59.712]  Okay.
[01:43:59.772 --> 01:44:02.773]  Yeah, I mean... I mean, okay.
[01:44:03.653 --> 01:44:04.474]  You know, all right.
[01:44:04.574 --> 01:44:12.616]  So when you touch the stuff off, which isn't easy, by the way, it doesn't ignite easily, but when you do ignite it,
[01:44:13.405 --> 01:44:16.347]  Then you get this white-hot molten metal.
[01:44:16.367 --> 01:44:19.289]  I mean, the reaction zone is just this brilliant white.
[01:44:19.329 --> 01:44:22.291]  We use dark glasses, sunglasses, to protect our eyes then.
[01:44:23.231 --> 01:44:32.357]  And you have this white ash floating away as dust, a very fine powder of aluminum oxide floating away.
[01:44:32.417 --> 01:44:33.678]  That's one of the end products.
[01:44:33.698 --> 01:44:39.462]  And then, of course, the other end product that's so dramatic is this yellow-to-white-hot molten iron.
[01:44:40.353 --> 01:44:42.574]  It flows out of the reaction zone.
[01:44:42.874 --> 01:44:52.420]  What we did, we actually added sulfur to some thermite, mixed it up here myself, and my daughter was helping me.
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:54.741]  She did it as a science fair project.
[01:44:54.761 --> 01:44:57.723]  She said, Dad, I want to... I said, sure, we'll do that.
[01:44:57.803 --> 01:45:01.945]  We put some sulfur in, put it in a steel cup,
[01:45:02.794 --> 01:45:07.396]  And touched that off, and I'll tell you, she was going to time, how long does it take to eat through the steel?
[01:45:07.856 --> 01:45:08.417]  One second.
[01:45:08.817 --> 01:45:10.058]  It was a fraction of a second.
[01:45:10.078 --> 01:45:11.658]  I mean, it was so fast we couldn't time it.
[01:45:11.918 --> 01:45:20.002]  Have you seen the Discovery Channel videos where they put it on a huge truck engine block, a little bitty cup of it, and it eats the entire block in like two seconds?
[01:45:20.102 --> 01:45:21.723]  I've seen one just like that.
[01:45:21.743 --> 01:45:23.324]  In fact, I showed one in Chicago.
[01:45:23.344 --> 01:45:23.764]  Remember that?
[01:45:24.104 --> 01:45:24.645]  Yes.
[01:45:24.705 --> 01:45:27.006]  People like to see how that comes through.
[01:45:27.026 --> 01:45:29.167]  I don't think those guys added sulfur, though.
[01:45:29.327 --> 01:45:29.427]  No.
[01:45:30.296 --> 01:45:35.400]  But see, if you add sulfur, it makes it go through steel considerably faster.
[01:45:35.420 --> 01:45:36.521]  It basically explodes.
[01:45:37.362 --> 01:45:39.864]  Well, yeah, let me talk about explosion.
[01:45:40.044 --> 01:45:43.487]  We call this an incendiary because there's no explosion sound.
[01:45:43.927 --> 01:45:49.992]  I mean, it's just a dramatic reaction, but it's over quickly, but there's no explosion sound.
[01:45:50.013 --> 01:45:51.874]  But I would call the reaction explosive.
[01:45:52.615 --> 01:45:52.815]  Okay.
[01:45:52.835 --> 01:45:52.915]  Okay.
[01:45:53.727 --> 01:45:54.688]  I mean, it's so fast.
[01:45:55.328 --> 01:45:56.049]  It's very fast.
[01:45:56.089 --> 01:46:01.593]  But let me say, there is a form of thermite that is actually explosive, just like TNT.
[01:46:01.774 --> 01:46:02.975]  I mean, it will explode.
[01:46:03.955 --> 01:46:05.957]  And that form is called superthermite.
[01:46:06.097 --> 01:46:07.018]  You can Google on that.
[01:46:07.238 --> 01:46:08.159]  Again, no secret.
[01:46:09.139 --> 01:46:14.624]  And this is ultra-fine aluminum powder mixed with ultra-fine...
[01:46:15.425 --> 01:46:16.465]  Iron oxide powder.
[01:46:16.586 --> 01:46:20.927]  I'm talking around 100 nanometers and down, a particular size.
[01:46:21.448 --> 01:46:25.129]  So when you do that, you touch that off, and it will explode.
[01:46:26.129 --> 01:46:33.172]  And frankly, the aluminum powder I got out of our chemical stores here was quite fine powder.
[01:46:34.533 --> 01:46:40.555]  So the first time we ran it, we stood well back because I wasn't sure whether it was actually going to explode or not.
[01:46:40.575 --> 01:46:44.417]  What are the other scientists that have been overseeing your research there at the university thinking?
[01:46:45.462 --> 01:46:57.049]  Well, you know, okay, let me say that those who have read my paper, by and large, support what I'm doing, certainly support the research.
[01:46:57.569 --> 01:47:04.112]  There are others who just, you know, shrug their shoulders and, I don't know.
[01:47:04.233 --> 01:47:05.433]  But you said they're in denial.
[01:47:05.773 --> 01:47:09.215]  It's like anybody else, Alex, you know, it's like anybody else.
[01:47:09.315 --> 01:47:13.938]  It's such an implication to stop many people from going past
[01:47:14.654 --> 01:47:15.334]  Square one.
[01:47:15.374 --> 01:47:19.737]  I mean, they say, well, wait a minute, you know, are we talking about an inside job here?
[01:47:19.757 --> 01:47:21.998]  And I'm saying, well, I'm talking about physics.
[01:47:22.018 --> 01:47:24.840]  And they say, but that would imply an inside job.
[01:47:25.020 --> 01:47:26.321]  I say, I'm afraid so.
[01:47:26.341 --> 01:47:30.443]  You know, explosives in a building, it takes time to plan and plant.
[01:47:31.132 --> 01:47:33.273]  Those explosives and incendiaries.
[01:47:33.453 --> 01:47:34.813]  Oh, by the way, have you heard the newest?
[01:47:34.853 --> 01:47:40.474]  The neocons are now getting on talk radio and writing articles saying the Arabs put bombs and thermite in.
[01:47:40.614 --> 01:47:41.835]  Oh, no, you're kidding.
[01:47:41.935 --> 01:47:42.215]  No.
[01:47:42.395 --> 01:47:43.335]  Oh, no, sir.
[01:47:43.415 --> 01:47:43.855]  Yes, sir.
[01:47:44.535 --> 01:47:46.836]  They're now saying that the Arabs did it.
[01:47:49.296 --> 01:47:50.477]  In Building 7-2, huh?
[01:47:50.997 --> 01:47:51.337]  Yes.
[01:47:51.937 --> 01:47:52.257]  I see.
[01:47:52.877 --> 01:47:54.398]  Now, it's no official announcement.
[01:47:54.438 --> 01:47:56.018]  The neocons are just out saying it.
[01:47:56.658 --> 01:47:57.919]  That is interesting.
[01:47:58.360 --> 01:48:03.604]  Well, at least, you know, they're finding these arguments of thermite hard to refute, so an explosive.
[01:48:04.105 --> 01:48:07.708]  So I guess that's some degree of progress.
[01:48:07.768 --> 01:48:18.037]  But, of course, to suggest that Arabs had access in these buildings, particularly Building 7, which housed a secret CIA office, is ridiculous in the extreme.
[01:48:18.996 --> 01:48:22.518]  Well, it was Defense Intelligence, the Port Authority, the City Police.
[01:48:22.618 --> 01:48:24.619]  I mean, everybody was there.
[01:48:24.679 --> 01:48:25.520]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:26.340]  Oh, I mean, I know.
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:29.002]  This is a very secure building.
[01:48:29.482 --> 01:48:31.263]  I'm sure there's security.
[01:48:31.303 --> 01:48:33.404]  Who was in charge of security at the towers?
[01:48:33.505 --> 01:48:37.047]  I mean, he would be offended to have the suggestion.
[01:48:37.087 --> 01:48:38.307]  Wasn't that Marvin Bush?
[01:48:38.327 --> 01:48:39.208]  Marvin Bush, yes.
[01:48:39.708 --> 01:48:41.209]  Oh, yes, Marvin Bush.
[01:48:42.490 --> 01:48:43.951]  I mean, he would be offended to hear that.
[01:48:44.912 --> 01:48:47.098]  Somehow these guys have slipped by them.
[01:48:49.003 --> 01:48:50.587]  Well, there's other facets to this.
[01:48:50.707 --> 01:48:52.973]  I mean, in our talk, you talked about how
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:57.301]  We've had all these other skyscrapers burn for multiple days in some cases.
[01:48:57.341 --> 01:49:00.701]  These are laboratory experiments in the real world.
[01:49:00.761 --> 01:49:04.842]  That right there shows that the fires didn't bring these buildings down.
[01:49:04.902 --> 01:49:08.663]  Now you've got the thermite evidence, and we've got video of it pouring out.
[01:49:08.703 --> 01:49:09.423]  You've tested it.
[01:49:09.923 --> 01:49:11.703]  When you test it, it isn't just thermite.
[01:49:11.823 --> 01:49:12.523]  It's thermate.
[01:49:12.623 --> 01:49:14.284]  I mean, wow, this is amazing.
[01:49:14.544 --> 01:49:20.745]  Yeah, it's one of those cases where the evidence, as it comes out, and it takes some work to dig at it,
[01:49:22.088 --> 01:49:24.769]  Literally dig at it in the case of the molten metal samples.
[01:49:25.309 --> 01:49:30.090]  It just fits this picture of controlled demolition.
[01:49:31.591 --> 01:49:34.231]  And the case is getting overwhelming now, I'm afraid.
[01:49:34.692 --> 01:49:36.972]  Well, I salute you, Professor Stephen Jones.
[01:49:37.012 --> 01:49:39.373]  A final little five-minute segment here on the other side.
[01:49:39.393 --> 01:49:43.414]  You can get back to your students and maybe have time to eat that bologna sandwich you got.
[01:49:43.794 --> 01:49:45.194]  I'm guessing what you're eating for lunch.
[01:49:45.334 --> 01:49:46.835]  It was tuna, but yeah, you're right.
[01:49:48.515 --> 01:49:49.216]  I'm the same way.
[01:49:49.416 --> 01:49:49.996]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:52.973 --> 01:50:01.241]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here, and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[01:50:01.441 --> 01:50:03.783]  We're expecting around 1,000 people in attendance.
[01:50:04.384 --> 01:50:13.233]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[01:50:13.733 --> 01:50:17.235]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda.
[01:50:17.695 --> 01:50:38.483]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Tarpley, Professor Jim Fetzen, and many, many others, including special guests.
[01:50:38.803 --> 01:50:42.545]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[01:50:43.026 --> 01:50:44.269]  Arm yourself with the truth.

[01:53:01.124 --> 01:53:05.432]  Professor Jones did a great job at the Chicago 9-11 Conference.
[01:53:06.013 --> 01:53:09.720]  He'll be doing his big PowerPoint, complete with video clips, documents, photos.
[01:53:10.675 --> 01:53:16.518]  Going over the collapse of World Trade Center 1, 2, and 7 coming up on the 24th and 25th.
[01:53:16.538 --> 01:53:17.838]  He's one of our keynote speakers.
[01:53:18.319 --> 01:53:20.400]  We really look forward to him being there and thank him for being there.

[01:53:26.343 --> 01:53:27.783]  It happens every event I ever have.
[01:53:27.803 --> 01:53:28.804]  We'll turn away hundreds.
[01:53:29.364 --> 01:53:31.905]  In fact, they had standing room only in Chicago and this wasn't my event.
[01:53:32.225 --> 01:53:33.246]  It was supposed to hold 500.
[01:53:33.286 --> 01:53:34.126]  It was really over 600.
[01:53:34.807 --> 01:53:35.567]  They overfilled it.
[01:53:35.607 --> 01:53:36.487]  People were standing.
[01:53:37.308 --> 01:53:39.869]  I don't want to do this with my event, so we're going to cut it off.
[01:53:40.493 --> 01:53:49.481]  And it's going to sell out, so call toll-free to get tickets, 1-888-253-3139, or go to Infowars.com and find out all the details.
[01:53:49.882 --> 01:53:57.929]  Professor Jones, in the last three minutes we've got left here, I want to thank you for joining us, but any other facets, any other areas, any other key points you'd like to make here today?
[01:53:59.190 --> 01:54:02.554]  Well, we've covered that which is most interesting to me.
[01:54:02.634 --> 01:54:03.514]  I guess I will...
[01:54:05.910 --> 01:54:08.294]  Well, first of all, I'm looking forward to the LA conference.
[01:54:08.835 --> 01:54:16.148]  That was great fun in Chicago, and I think what you're doing in LA will be, as you say, bigger, and I'm really looking forward to that.
[01:54:19.053 --> 01:54:21.194]  What about going back to your previous research?
[01:54:21.234 --> 01:54:30.516]  Before, you were just showing mathematically and with science that the official story was impossible, and how they claim they fell was a lie.
[01:54:30.856 --> 01:54:38.598]  Now you've got this, and then we've got all the firefighters and police saying bombs are going off, and we have all this other... We have Silverstein slipping up and saying he pulled it.
[01:54:38.978 --> 01:54:40.959]  I mean, is this not an orgy of evidence?
[01:54:40.979 --> 01:54:43.759]  Did they think that we wouldn't notice or we wouldn't catch him?
[01:54:43.779 --> 01:54:44.980]  Why do you think they thought they'd get away with it?
[01:54:45.580 --> 01:54:46.020]  Oh, gosh.
[01:54:46.835 --> 01:54:51.359]  I mean, now we're out of physics into pathological psychology, Alex.
[01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:53.680]  I mean, these guys.
[01:54:54.161 --> 01:54:57.463]  But, you know, they made mistakes, I think, is the explanation.
[01:54:58.104 --> 01:55:00.906]  And, I mean, look, they shipped this steel out.
[01:55:01.186 --> 01:55:05.009]  They figured they, in my opinion, this was terrible.
[01:55:05.710 --> 01:55:06.790]  I mean, and many others, too.
[01:55:06.810 --> 01:55:08.812]  They shipped that evidence out of there and melted.
[01:55:09.673 --> 01:55:10.713]  But they made mistakes.
[01:55:10.814 --> 01:55:16.518]  I mean, there's enough evidence around that we can piece together as archaeology or archaeometry.
[01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:22.626]  We can actually piece together fairly clearly now what's happened.
[01:55:22.806 --> 01:55:28.572]  You specifically spoke... I mean, you said two colleagues work with you on these projects there.
[01:55:28.592 --> 01:55:31.636]  What are they now saying after these other scientists worked with you?
[01:55:32.897 --> 01:55:38.403]  Well, I mean, in particular, one of them working with me, his approach is...
[01:55:39.927 --> 01:55:40.968]  It has been for months.
[01:55:41.008 --> 01:55:49.895]  He says, I am determined to find out what's in these previously molten metal samples and publish it and let the chips fall where they may.
[01:55:49.955 --> 01:55:50.755]  That's his approach.
[01:55:50.795 --> 01:55:56.219]  He said, I don't really like to get into who is involved.
[01:55:56.239 --> 01:56:01.984]  Now, personally, I find I have to try to figure that out too, but it's hard.
[01:56:02.984 --> 01:56:07.568]  And you've done a lot of research on that, and I like Webster Tarpley's research and others.
[01:56:08.137 --> 01:56:11.679]  You know, people have gotten into it, but... You were trying to say something before I interrupted you.
[01:56:11.699 --> 01:56:12.179]  What was that?
[01:56:13.220 --> 01:56:14.020]  Oh, gosh.
[01:56:15.501 --> 01:56:18.683]  I guess that the people I'm working with here are becoming convinced.
[01:56:18.763 --> 01:56:26.788]  I talked to Jeff yesterday, and, you know, another physicist, and he is... He started... He said he's been reading about...
[01:56:28.280 --> 01:56:30.481]  Yeah, the neoconservatives and the bankers.
[01:56:31.562 --> 01:56:32.462]  It doesn't take long.
[01:56:32.502 --> 01:56:36.244]  You get into this, and again, the evidence starts falling into place.
[01:56:36.424 --> 01:56:38.685]  Well, the big thing is these globalists brag about it.
[01:56:38.725 --> 01:56:42.907]  They write policy papers, and then you've got their own words.
[01:56:43.287 --> 01:56:46.088]  Yeah, you've got that PNAC document, which I read through.
[01:56:46.108 --> 01:56:48.489]  I mean, it's couched in language.
[01:56:48.509 --> 01:56:49.450]  It doesn't sound too bad.
[01:56:49.470 --> 01:56:51.331]  But then you read about this...
[01:56:52.643 --> 01:56:55.086]  Catastrophic and catalyzing event.
[01:56:55.947 --> 01:56:59.150]  And you're sitting there, boy, I hope they don't have another one of these up their sleeve, you know.
[01:57:00.172 --> 01:57:08.722]  And so, well, that possibility does raise some urgency and means that this scientific research is more than just
[01:57:09.795 --> 01:57:11.115]  An academic exercise.
[01:57:11.335 --> 01:57:12.556]  It's about saving this country.
[01:57:13.056 --> 01:57:15.176]  Professor Jones, thank you for what you're doing.
[01:57:15.216 --> 01:57:18.957]  I can't wait to shake your hand again and buy you dinner in Los Angeles.
[01:57:18.997 --> 01:57:20.017]  We'll see you on the... I look forward to it.
[01:57:20.418 --> 01:57:20.718]  You bet.
[01:57:20.758 --> 01:57:21.598]  Get back to your class.
[01:57:21.638 --> 01:57:22.078]  God bless you.
[01:57:22.098 --> 01:57:22.458]  Okay.
[01:57:22.498 --> 01:57:22.798]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:57:22.818 --> 01:57:23.958]  Talk to you later.
[01:57:24.098 --> 01:57:24.418]  Bye-bye.
[01:57:24.438 --> 01:57:24.839]  Take care.
[01:57:25.479 --> 01:57:30.380]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we've got a special interview coming up for you, and I'm off to Bilderberg.
[01:57:30.460 --> 01:57:30.940]  Bye-bye.
[01:57:33.010 --> 01:57:37.855]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:37.895 --> 01:57:38.335]  Big Brother.
[01:57:38.375 --> 01:57:39.276]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:39.496 --> 01:57:45.602]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:45.742 --> 01:57:48.304]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.295 --> 01:57:57.215]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.875 --> 01:58:01.476]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.036 --> 01:58:06.137]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.677 --> 01:58:09.077]  Remember Nick Berg?
[01:58:09.257 --> 01:58:12.338]  He got his head supposedly sawed off in Iraq.
[01:58:13.458 --> 01:58:16.639]  Why did he give one of the hijackers his laptop and passcode?
[01:58:17.639 --> 01:58:23.560]  Why did he and so many others, including Oklahoma City bombers, train at the same military base, same flight school?
[01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:25.821]  How does it all interconnect?
[01:58:25.981 --> 01:58:28.882]  Very, very important, detailed report coming up.
[01:58:28.902 --> 01:58:33.744]  We have posted on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com with a guest in the next segment.
[01:58:33.824 --> 01:58:35.024]  Right now, R.B.
[01:58:35.784 --> 01:58:36.685]  R.B., you're on the air.
[01:58:36.705 --> 01:58:37.685]  Where are you calling us from?
[01:58:38.045 --> 01:58:39.186]  Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.
[01:58:39.666 --> 01:58:40.026]  Welcome.
[01:58:40.326 --> 01:58:40.706]  Go ahead.
[01:58:41.087 --> 01:58:42.187]  I'm listening on the Internet.
[01:58:42.267 --> 01:58:42.987]  Big fan.
[01:58:43.007 --> 01:58:44.348]  I've watched a lot of your videos.
[01:58:46.549 --> 01:58:49.190]  They're conditioning us up here in Canada right now.
[01:58:50.030 --> 01:58:52.371]  Ever since the conservative minority government got elected...
[01:58:53.126 --> 01:58:59.692]  He's Mr. Harper, Stephen Harper, the Prime Minister, Prime Minister up here, has been instituting rules that are like Bush-like.
[01:59:00.133 --> 01:59:03.416]  He wants the media to back off.
[01:59:03.456 --> 01:59:05.278]  He's eliminated certain things.
[01:59:05.318 --> 01:59:10.663]  He's brought down a top-down approach, the same way Bush did.
[01:59:10.683 --> 01:59:15.488]  He's a complete, he's only got a minority government, but he's acting completely like a,
[01:59:16.221 --> 01:59:24.843]  Well, he's also a member of the Bilderberg Group, and it's reported that he's going to be attending the meeting on the 8th, 9th, and 10th in Ottawa.
[01:59:25.223 --> 01:59:26.843]  Exactly, and this is the other thing.
[01:59:27.964 --> 01:59:32.625]  He's trying to institute a Bush-like approach to everything, and he's only got a minority government.
[01:59:33.245 --> 01:59:37.586]  And so, in reality, if there wasn't something up his sleeve, he'd be...
[01:59:39.218 --> 01:59:50.864]  He's endangering his position, his government, his minority government, the way he's acting towards the media and the people, ignoring democratic procedures and stuff like that, almost like he's got something up his sleeve.
[01:59:50.984 --> 01:59:57.888]  But he's supposedly conservative, but he's not retracting some of the gun control laws brought in by the, quote, liberals.
[01:59:58.008 --> 01:59:58.648]  Oh, no.
[01:59:58.688 --> 02:00:07.013]  In fact, he says he ran on eliminating it, but as soon as he got elected, of course, he said, oh, we can't eliminate it because the rest of the country would be upset, blah, blah, blah.
[02:00:07.409 --> 02:00:11.819]  And now they're just going to phase it in more efficiently.
[02:00:12.441 --> 02:00:12.982]  Oh, yes.
[02:00:13.162 --> 02:00:17.071]  And lately we've had two parliamentary sessions where
[02:00:17.717 --> 02:00:28.363]  Experts have gotten up and said, well, the conditions are set in Canada now for a terrorist attack here in Canada, just like in England in the subway system, from homegrown Al-Qaeda sympathizers.
[02:00:28.383 --> 02:00:29.964]  And he says there's many of them.
[02:00:30.004 --> 02:00:30.945]  We know where they are.
[02:00:31.005 --> 02:00:31.905]  We know who they are.
[02:00:31.925 --> 02:00:34.747]  And I'm thinking, oh, jeez, I've heard this before.
[02:00:34.827 --> 02:00:36.228]  But they can't bust them, though.
[02:00:36.508 --> 02:00:37.429]  No, of course not.
[02:00:37.949 --> 02:00:39.910]  But they can take all your freedoms, though.
[02:00:40.290 --> 02:00:42.812]  Well, it's just funny, especially with that Cotter thing.
[02:00:43.519 --> 02:00:55.087]  This Qadar kid, who was used by the CIA when he got round up in Afghanistan, along with his little brothers, little brothers, 15-year-old brothers, still in the, was sent down to Guantanamo.
[02:00:55.708 --> 02:01:03.233]  But this guy was 18 or 19 at the time, and he was used by the CIA to infiltrate into Iraq and stuff.
[02:01:03.253 --> 02:01:09.277]  They said, well, we're going to, if you play ball with us, you know, they rounded him up in one of those generic sweeps over in Afghanistan.
[02:01:09.317 --> 02:01:10.278]  He was over there with his dad.
[02:01:10.942 --> 02:01:27.730]  And they said, if you play ball with us and pretend to be an Al Qaeda terrorist and go out and make all these statements and tell your mom and dad and your family members that you're a member of Al Qaeda, and then that gets broadcast all over at home here.
[02:01:27.750 --> 02:01:30.912]  And so it's a psyop.
[02:01:31.477 --> 02:01:33.198]  And they're doing it for us up here in Canada now.
[02:01:33.259 --> 02:01:33.499]  I know.
[02:01:33.539 --> 02:01:38.943]  They had a bunch of events where they bused supposed Al-Qaeda leaders, and then a month later you'll see it in the BBC.
[02:01:39.343 --> 02:01:42.386]  Oh, that was a staged arrest to protect the agents' anonymity.
[02:01:42.686 --> 02:01:44.147]  That wasn't a real Al-Qaeda.
[02:01:44.187 --> 02:01:44.948]  Thanks for the call.
[02:01:45.428 --> 02:01:46.509]  I appreciate your call.
[02:01:46.549 --> 02:01:51.133]  We'll get to Paul, another call in Canada here later, and Charles and others.
[02:01:51.173 --> 02:01:52.614]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:01:52.814 --> 02:01:58.699]  We'll have open phones throughout this hour, but we've got a special guest coming up.
[02:01:58.719 --> 02:01:59.680]  He's put out a...
[02:02:00.340 --> 02:02:01.660]  Detailed report here.
[02:02:02.500 --> 02:02:08.222]  Getting into some of the bizarre goings-on in Oklahoma.
[02:02:08.962 --> 02:02:13.482]  Terrorist training camps, bizarre CIA operations.
[02:02:14.143 --> 02:02:16.563]  It's all coming up after this quick break.
[02:02:17.643 --> 02:02:22.884]  Don't forget, we've got our big 9-11 symposium coming up June 24th and 25th.
[02:02:22.984 --> 02:02:24.865]  Get your tickets now before they're all gone.
[02:02:24.885 --> 02:02:26.805]  They're starting to go really quick.
[02:02:27.472 --> 02:02:29.033]  Ray McGovern's going to be there.
[02:02:29.273 --> 02:02:30.654]  Professor Stephen Jones.
[02:02:30.754 --> 02:02:31.634]  Jim Fetzer.
[02:02:32.415 --> 02:02:34.076]  And so many others.
[02:02:34.796 --> 02:02:38.378]  Coming up late next month.
[02:02:38.398 --> 02:02:42.140]  We're only, what, 24 days away from this conference kicking off.
[02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:42.880]  So get your tickets now.
[02:02:45.256 --> 02:02:53.525]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here, and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[02:02:53.706 --> 02:02:56.048]  We're expecting around 1,000 people in attendance.
[02:02:56.649 --> 02:03:05.499]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[02:03:06.019 --> 02:03:09.541]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda.
[02:03:09.962 --> 02:03:30.755]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Charmley, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[02:03:31.096 --> 02:03:34.758]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[02:03:35.299 --> 02:03:36.541]  Arm yourself with the truth.
[02:03:36.902 --> 02:03:42.193]  Secure your tickets today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:03:46.244 --> 02:03:55.310]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[02:03:55.570 --> 02:04:06.797]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:04:07.137 --> 02:04:12.841]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[02:04:13.081 --> 02:04:13.761]  We're good to go.
[02:04:37.474 --> 02:04:37.694]  803-4438.
[02:04:37.714 --> 02:04:39.959]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:04:44.907 --> 02:04:46.548]  I used to be ashamed of my toenails.
[02:04:46.628 --> 02:04:50.891]  I thought I was destined to wear tennis shoes through the heat of the summer and hide my toes at the beach.
[02:04:51.311 --> 02:04:53.973]  And then my podiatrist told me about Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:04:54.133 --> 02:04:58.736]  It tackles unsightly nails by clearing out the cause of the problem, yellowing keratin debris buildup.
[02:04:58.896 --> 02:05:03.720]  With regular use, Non-X Gel breaks down and removes the debris, so toenails look clear.
[02:05:03.920 --> 02:05:08.643]  This summer, I'm wearing open-toed sandals again, thanks to a topical natural gel called Non-X.
[02:05:08.863 --> 02:05:11.545]  If your toenails are embarrassing, I recommend Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:05:11.765 --> 02:05:14.667]  It's at your pharmacy or mass retailer in the foot care section.
[02:05:15.948 --> 02:05:16.948]  Looking for profit?
[02:05:17.028 --> 02:05:18.409]  Looking for safety and security?
[02:05:18.749 --> 02:05:21.591]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[02:05:22.011 --> 02:05:29.555]  This low mintage collector coin with a total series mintage under $600,000 has sold at four times its current price.
[02:05:29.635 --> 02:05:33.177]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[02:05:33.377 --> 02:05:34.898]  Secure your position today.
[02:05:35.198 --> 02:05:36.439]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:05:36.479 --> 02:05:36.699]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:05:45.786 --> 02:05:51.411]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:51.511 --> 02:06:11.969]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:12.469 --> 02:06:13.070]  We're live.
[02:06:14.870 --> 02:06:23.676]  My airplane landed about 30 minutes ago here in Austin, Texas from the trip from hell, but it was a very, very good trip overall.
[02:06:23.696 --> 02:06:38.626]  We got very valuable information, a great victory against the New World Order, exposing the Bilderberg Group, getting it all over national Canadian television, CTV, and of course the CBC, all over the front pages of their national newspapers.
[02:06:40.548 --> 02:06:43.730]  And I was flying back from Ottawa, Canada,
[02:06:45.413 --> 02:06:49.275]  Today, I was supposed to fly out yesterday, but the plane broke down.
[02:06:49.315 --> 02:06:52.917]  There were a bunch of storms in Illinois, so we had to stay the night there.
[02:06:52.937 --> 02:07:01.682]  And we flew, instead of through Chicago, we came through Ottawa to Atlanta, and then again just landed about 35 minutes ago.
[02:07:01.782 --> 02:07:03.363]  So we're here live.
[02:07:03.643 --> 02:07:09.947]  I wanted to go live today to be able to express to you some of the things that we learned at Bilderberg.
[02:07:12.688 --> 02:07:13.108]  We're good to go.
[02:07:13.148 --> 02:07:13.689]  We're good to go.
[02:07:39.255 --> 02:07:42.320]  Trying to get people to talk about how they wanted to carry out violence.
[02:07:42.901 --> 02:07:48.810]  I'm so sick of police and security people and government spooks out trying to provocateur.
[02:07:49.852 --> 02:07:51.013]  You're a bunch of criminals.
[02:07:51.975 --> 02:08:11.824]  And you know you're criminals, so you want desperately to get us to shoot our mouths off about criminal activities so you can have some big headline news, not just the fake stuff you cooked up with young Muslims that want to blow up the parliament there in Ottawa, but cook up something about how there was a plan to go after the Bilderberg Group.
[02:08:13.485 --> 02:08:15.926]  I flew in to Ottawa.
[02:08:17.643 --> 02:08:21.767]  On Wednesday night, we did the live interview with Professor Stephen Jones.
[02:08:21.787 --> 02:08:22.587]  We got packed up.
[02:08:22.647 --> 02:08:23.088]  We left.
[02:08:23.108 --> 02:08:25.710]  We flew in that evening at about 11.45.
[02:08:27.051 --> 02:08:29.313]  There were hundreds of people in front of us in customs.
[02:08:29.353 --> 02:08:30.614]  They were all waved right through.
[02:08:30.734 --> 02:08:32.976]  All three of us were pulled out and taken in.
[02:08:34.117 --> 02:08:37.059]  They pretty quickly said, you're here for the conference, aren't you?
[02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:39.902]  And began screaming and cussing at us.
[02:08:41.468 --> 02:08:48.094]  And asking us if we were planning anything violent, if we were planning to infiltrate, if we had any guns or bombs.
[02:08:50.737 --> 02:08:53.399]  And to even try to tell that story would take an hour.
[02:08:53.519 --> 02:08:57.303]  This went on for 15 hours off and on.
[02:08:59.264 --> 02:09:02.968]  Being cussed at, being told, you Americans, SH all over us.
[02:09:04.469 --> 02:09:09.090]  It was quite interesting, but I wasn't sad for myself going through it.
[02:09:09.110 --> 02:09:15.211]  I really see tribulation and persecution as a sign that we're doing good work and having an effect.
[02:09:16.372 --> 02:09:30.415]  I was upset for them because it let me realize how many people will serve evil, how many people will follow orders, how many people will abuse good people simply because the power structure has told them to do it.
[02:09:33.328 --> 02:09:43.093]  And while I was in Canada, you know, instead of just getting into the abuse, we can talk about that story more tomorrow or later in the hour if we have time.
[02:09:44.674 --> 02:09:47.256]  Why shouldn't I just talk about what we saw, what we learned there?
[02:09:48.876 --> 02:09:50.117]  That's probably more important.
[02:09:51.718 --> 02:09:54.119]  We got the complete list from the Bilderberg Group.
[02:09:54.139 --> 02:09:57.201]  We also got a little press release they put out, but we got the list separately.
[02:09:59.142 --> 02:10:05.727]  And it's Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, whose husband was an SS officer and who's the founder of Bilderberg Group in 1954.
[02:10:06.907 --> 02:10:23.559]  Of course, David Rockefeller, Henry Kissinger, former head of the World Bank, Wolftensen, Richard C. Holbrooke, just a who's who of current and former government officials, the heads of banking, Paul Volcker, former head of the Federal Reserve,
[02:10:24.691 --> 02:10:26.712]  And tomorrow we'll have more time.
[02:10:26.732 --> 02:10:34.634]  In fact, maybe even now if I have time to get that out of my bags and read some of the list on air to go over it properly for you.
[02:10:36.695 --> 02:10:44.058]  But being there, having different groups of police on different shifts tell us different things.
[02:10:44.118 --> 02:10:46.038]  Like there was clear parking in front of the hotel.
[02:10:46.098 --> 02:10:50.340]  It said that you could park about 200 yards away on one of the roads adjoining it.
[02:10:50.942 --> 02:10:55.184]  But the police would come over and shine lights in our eyes and say, you're not allowed to park here.
[02:10:55.204 --> 02:10:57.445]  And I'd point and say, the sign says you're allowed to park here.
[02:10:57.466 --> 02:10:58.946]  And they'd threaten to arrest us.
[02:10:58.986 --> 02:10:59.787]  We'd say, go ahead.
[02:11:00.647 --> 02:11:03.729]  We've got people videotaping this across the street, not just these cameras.
[02:11:03.809 --> 02:11:05.810]  And we know we're allowed to park here.
[02:11:06.710 --> 02:11:10.151]  Then they would tell us we couldn't be on the sidewalk or we couldn't stand on the grass.
[02:11:11.112 --> 02:11:16.974]  Luckily, some of the locals have come with the plots that showed what was public property, what was Bilderberg Group property.
[02:11:16.994 --> 02:11:22.776]  I say Bilderberg Group property because it's a Bilderberg Group member who owns this entire industrial park.
[02:11:22.976 --> 02:11:25.957]  Lockheed Martin, he owns the building it's in.
[02:11:26.857 --> 02:11:35.420]  There's a Canadian NSA listening station nearby and a whole complex of big buildings that this one individual built.
[02:11:36.201 --> 02:11:37.862]  Who's a Bilderberg Group member owns.
[02:11:38.142 --> 02:11:43.203]  And there's the Brook Street Hotel slash resort, five-star hotel with a big golf course.
[02:11:43.643 --> 02:11:44.724]  And that's where they were staying.
[02:11:47.265 --> 02:11:50.906]  And right off the bat, I get out of the car, and these guys come over.
[02:11:50.966 --> 02:11:53.567]  It's always the same, you know, FBI type.
[02:11:53.967 --> 02:11:56.508]  I guess, well, the Federal Royal Mounted Police.
[02:11:56.888 --> 02:11:58.088]  You can tell those guys in a minute.
[02:11:58.448 --> 02:12:00.389]  All about six-foot-three, muscled.
[02:12:01.541 --> 02:12:02.242]  We're good to go.
[02:12:22.617 --> 02:12:31.642]  Then there was a fellow who we later saw going on property that we know was security, and he spoke with a Dutch accent, and he thought we were so stupid.
[02:12:32.522 --> 02:12:36.905]  He was wearing a Netherlands shirt with a lion rampant on it.
[02:12:37.985 --> 02:12:48.751]  He'd get very upset if we ever aimed cameras at him, but in between that, he ran around saying that we need to kill Freemasons, and we need to attack the Bilderberg Group, and
[02:12:49.306 --> 02:12:54.030]  And, of course, there were cops just a few feet away waiting like wolves for the signal.
[02:12:54.090 --> 02:12:58.974]  If we said anything, it would have been on national news, international news, that we were planning to do something violent.
[02:13:00.095 --> 02:13:05.499]  I mean, this first happened to me, I guess, what is it, eight, nine years ago.
[02:13:05.559 --> 02:13:14.786]  We tried to build an old veteran who died a few years ago, Joe Campana, a highly decorated World War II vet, and he was an atomic soldier after that, and he didn't brag about it.
[02:13:14.826 --> 02:13:16.548]  We found it all in his house.
[02:13:16.568 --> 02:13:17.929]  We didn't even talk about it.
[02:13:18.669 --> 02:13:21.911]  And they wanted to bulldoze his house, and so we went and built him a new house.
[02:13:21.991 --> 02:13:25.733]  I mean, police showed up trying to provoke a tourist.
[02:13:26.374 --> 02:13:28.175]  We'd follow them out, and they'd be unmarked cars.
[02:13:28.215 --> 02:13:29.575]  You guys are so shameful.
[02:13:30.716 --> 02:13:31.797]  You're so evil.
[02:13:32.757 --> 02:13:33.918]  You're so evil.
[02:13:34.018 --> 02:13:35.079]  You're so bad.
[02:13:36.339 --> 02:13:45.245]  And that was going on here, and to watch these police, local Royal Mountain Police, the federal police, and the local Ottawa police,
[02:13:46.403 --> 02:13:47.504]  We're good to go.
[02:13:47.524 --> 02:13:48.024]  We're good to go.
[02:14:08.787 --> 02:14:09.988]  And we got video.
[02:14:10.008 --> 02:14:12.650]  We had high-powered Zoom video cameras.
[02:14:12.670 --> 02:14:15.193]  We got Queen Beatrix on video, David Rockefeller.
[02:14:15.253 --> 02:14:23.279]  They had national press there with the big, long lenses, you know, the two-foot-long lenses, getting up-close photos of all of these elite.
[02:14:25.881 --> 02:14:29.044]  And then, of course, Saturday was really the finale.
[02:14:29.084 --> 02:14:31.166]  I was back out there yesterday on Sunday.
[02:14:32.267 --> 02:14:34.549]  But Saturday was really the finale because...
[02:14:35.879 --> 02:14:38.081]  A local went and bought a bullhorn.
[02:14:38.141 --> 02:14:42.445]  He and his young son and his brother were there, these good families.
[02:14:43.286 --> 02:14:52.133]  Just to see these good-looking, happy families out there with these great-looking kids that spark in their eye out there protesting, demonstrating.
[02:14:52.153 --> 02:14:54.135]  There was upwards of 50 people there at any one time.
[02:14:54.215 --> 02:14:56.497]  Usually it was about 20 or 30.
[02:14:56.537 --> 02:15:02.943]  And he presented me with this bullhorn, kind of like I was in Chicago a week and a half ago and someone on the street presented me with a bullhorn.
[02:15:03.905 --> 02:15:07.007]  Well, I was there, and I got presented with a bullhorn.
[02:15:08.068 --> 02:15:10.009]  And, you know, I crossed a line there.
[02:15:10.970 --> 02:15:11.971]  I know what's dangerous.
[02:15:12.031 --> 02:15:13.171]  I know what's not dangerous.
[02:15:13.412 --> 02:15:15.953]  And I don't think I have any special courage.
[02:15:16.974 --> 02:15:19.076]  I do what I do because I've counted the cost.
[02:15:19.156 --> 02:15:21.077]  Somebody's got to stand up for the little people.
[02:15:21.737 --> 02:15:23.639]  Somebody's got to stand up for the children.
[02:15:24.199 --> 02:15:25.880]  Somebody's got to stand up for the family.
[02:15:25.960 --> 02:15:30.684]  Somebody's got to stand up for the farmers and ranchers that are having their land taken.
[02:15:36.333 --> 02:15:44.095]  But I knew that it would get their attention because it was almost biblical.
[02:15:44.135 --> 02:15:48.295]  Here's this huge, monolithic-looking, really evil-looking building.
[02:15:48.335 --> 02:15:51.856]  I would describe it as Nazi-style in front of us.
[02:15:51.976 --> 02:15:54.737]  It's kind of a neo-Art Deco style.
[02:15:56.017 --> 02:16:02.718]  And gray and green glass, gray stone, green glass.
[02:16:04.056 --> 02:16:14.602]  And I'm there, and I'm bullhorning into the building, and it's bouncing back so loud.
[02:16:14.642 --> 02:16:15.383]  It was echoing.
[02:16:15.423 --> 02:16:19.445]  It was like a 5,000-foot giant was screaming.
[02:16:20.366 --> 02:16:30.972]  And the Royal Dutch guard that was sneaking around in plain clothes was literally ripping their hair out, just staring at me with total hatred.
[02:16:32.521 --> 02:16:39.626]  And the police were freaking out, and there was nothing they could do because it's free speech still up there, and I was on the sidewalk.
[02:16:42.088 --> 02:16:47.372]  And I knew then that I really, I knew that when I was doing it, it was a choice.
[02:16:47.973 --> 02:16:52.016]  I knew that it was directly going to anger the Bilderberg Group, who was already aware of me.
[02:16:52.617 --> 02:16:55.579]  Customs admitted that Bilderberg had called, tried to keep me from coming in.
[02:16:57.210 --> 02:17:03.015]  And I've got secret police all around me, and I just went ahead and let them have it, and I think it was one of the better speeches I've given.
[02:17:03.795 --> 02:17:06.377]  We uploaded it on the Internet from the hotel.
[02:17:06.477 --> 02:17:07.358]  It's not very good quality.
[02:17:07.378 --> 02:17:10.620]  We're going to load a better copy up very soon for you.
[02:17:11.541 --> 02:17:14.884]  We're going to play some of that later, just part of it, about nine minutes of it.
[02:17:16.285 --> 02:17:22.970]  And I have never felt the Holy Spirit upon me so strong.
[02:17:23.010 --> 02:17:25.332]  You know I don't get up here and Bible thump and...
[02:17:28.126 --> 02:17:31.872]  But I have to tell you, after this event, Bohemian Grove was nothing.
[02:17:31.932 --> 02:17:33.535]  Doing this, this was even more elite.
[02:17:33.976 --> 02:17:42.570]  Doing what I did, I just have been, well I have, it's unbelievable.

[02:19:08.040 --> 02:19:09.560]  They are instruments of debt.

[02:19:45.805 --> 02:19:46.526]  Hello, folks.
[02:19:46.546 --> 02:19:53.390]  This is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger, your source for free solar electricity.
[02:19:53.630 --> 02:20:00.755]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[02:20:00.875 --> 02:20:12.422]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[02:20:12.803 --> 02:20:14.804]  Its multi-voltage capabilities multiply
[02:20:14.804 --> 02:20:15.645]  We're good to go.
[02:20:36.019 --> 02:20:36.400]  At 888-803-4438.
[02:20:36.500 --> 02:20:41.004]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:20:41.285 --> 02:20:42.286]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:20:46.241 --> 02:20:48.822]  What's better than a tiny tiger in your tank?
[02:20:49.142 --> 02:20:50.702]  A tornado under your hood!
[02:20:51.022 --> 02:20:56.604]  A tornado is an easy-to-install, maintenance-free air twister designed to increase gas mileage.
[02:20:56.924 --> 02:21:04.005]  I personally commissioned independent tests to verify results in six vehicles, and all of them gained MPG with Tornado.
[02:21:04.145 --> 02:21:08.927]  With today's gas prices, it makes sense to cage the gas-saving power of a tornado.
[02:21:09.107 --> 02:21:14.628]  Visit TornadoAir.com or pick up your tornado at Checker, Shucks, and Cragen today.
[02:21:16.603 --> 02:21:20.345]  In today's world of discord and disappointment, one thing's for sure.
[02:21:20.605 --> 02:21:25.407]  Car cover owners are so satisfied, they buy their car covers all over again.
[02:21:25.688 --> 02:21:27.168]  Think car covers are a hassle?
[02:21:27.428 --> 02:21:27.649]  No.
[02:21:27.989 --> 02:21:31.751]  Research shows owners find covers easy to put on and take off.
[02:21:32.151 --> 02:21:33.511]  Are all covers the same?
[02:21:33.751 --> 02:21:33.992]  No.
[02:21:34.272 --> 02:21:37.954]  The standard in car cover fabric is Block It by Kimberly Clark.
[02:21:38.334 --> 02:21:40.475]  Don't let sun and dust damage your car.
[02:21:40.755 --> 02:21:43.276]  Kimberly Clark's Block It fabric's got you covered.
[02:21:43.556 --> 02:21:44.957]  That's Block It by Kimberly.
[02:21:49.188 --> 02:21:50.348]  Oh, I love this song.
[02:21:50.448 --> 02:21:51.489]  It warms my heart.
[02:21:51.769 --> 02:21:52.689]  Feels good to my soul.
[02:22:06.889 --> 02:22:27.140]  We're going to have time to write articles.
[02:22:27.340 --> 02:22:30.342]  We're going to have time to lay out everything that happened in Bilderberg.
[02:22:30.362 --> 02:22:33.924]  We're going to make an amazing film out of it that you'll see in the next six months or so.
[02:22:35.051 --> 02:22:36.533]  We'll try to get it out as quickly as possible.
[02:22:36.553 --> 02:22:40.960]  We'll put a lot of it up for PrisonPlanet.tv members here in the next week or so.
[02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:41.801]  We do have a big L.A.
[02:22:41.821 --> 02:22:42.983]  conference coming up as well.
[02:22:43.524 --> 02:22:45.186]  But we'll get as much done as we can for you.
[02:22:46.408 --> 02:22:49.152]  But I, and after the break, we'll play part of the bullhorning.
[02:22:50.532 --> 02:22:52.213]  But I fully understood.
[02:22:52.613 --> 02:22:56.615]  From the time I got there, I felt greater evil than I've ever sensed.
[02:22:56.735 --> 02:22:58.436]  And the sixth sense is real.
[02:22:58.996 --> 02:23:02.118]  My discernment let me know that this was true wickedness.
[02:23:02.178 --> 02:23:11.202]  The Bilderberg Group admits, their own documents have been released to the BBC, what, two years ago when they went more public, that they founded the European Union.
[02:23:11.842 --> 02:23:13.443]  They are creating the American Union.
[02:23:13.843 --> 02:23:19.626]  This is the 120 most powerful people in the world, or the representatives, Rothschilds, Rockefellers, all of them,
[02:23:20.826 --> 02:23:25.687]  And when I was bullhorning, some of them even came out.
[02:23:27.248 --> 02:23:29.268]  People we could recognize even came out.
[02:23:30.248 --> 02:23:34.229]  So we got their attention, and they do not like that type of effrontery.
[02:23:34.329 --> 02:23:39.030]  And I knew that when I was doing it, that it was going into the lion's den.
[02:23:39.050 --> 02:23:42.411]  I'd already been through quite a bit of persecution.
[02:23:43.104 --> 02:23:44.925]  But I'm not here tooting my horn.
[02:23:45.345 --> 02:23:49.068]  I just know that I rarely have fear, and it wasn't even fear.
[02:23:49.128 --> 02:23:59.754]  It was more of I could feel a threshold being crossed, and I was already all over the newspapers from them detaining me and doing all the things they did to me.
[02:24:00.635 --> 02:24:08.600]  It even outraged the press because they went there and they were rude to the press as well and didn't deny my story and my cameraman's story.
[02:24:09.528 --> 02:24:25.212]  And so we know the Bilderberg Group was inside, who hates any media coverage of what they're doing, already angry, but it was a serious threshold that I crossed, and I really could feel that the Lord was with me while I was doing it.
[02:24:26.412 --> 02:24:28.232]  And it wasn't some type of emotional thing.
[02:24:28.272 --> 02:24:31.013]  It wasn't some type of... I've never felt like that in my whole life.
[02:24:31.493 --> 02:24:35.114]  While I was speaking to the Bilderberg Group, I...
[02:24:37.265 --> 02:24:37.865]  I don't know.
[02:24:54.013 --> 02:24:54.433]  We're good to go.
[02:25:17.722 --> 02:25:21.224]  What it's like when you commit more and more to fighting evil.
[02:25:21.644 --> 02:25:24.046]  When you get deeper and deeper into facing it.
[02:25:24.086 --> 02:25:27.047]  When you pass your fears time and time again.
[02:25:27.067 --> 02:25:30.549]  It's just wonderful.
[02:25:31.270 --> 02:25:32.331]  I am so blessed.
[02:25:32.431 --> 02:25:33.351]  I am so honored.
[02:25:33.471 --> 02:25:41.336]  I am so speechless that I grew up and learned about the New World Order and that God led me to the truth and all the experiences in my life.
[02:25:41.516 --> 02:25:43.077]  I'm ashamed of the bad things I've done.
[02:25:43.117 --> 02:25:44.998]  I'm ashamed of my arrogance.
[02:25:45.458 --> 02:25:46.839]  I'm ashamed of my aggression.
[02:25:48.165 --> 02:25:51.427]  At so many points, but I know that many of you understand that.
[02:25:51.467 --> 02:25:56.929]  You know I'm true, and that's what matters, is that I'm true to heart.
[02:25:57.470 --> 02:25:58.390]  I speak from the heart.
[02:25:58.430 --> 02:26:02.052]  I mean what I say, and I'm trying to do a good job.
[02:26:02.072 --> 02:26:03.492]  I'm trying to fight these people.
[02:26:03.552 --> 02:26:04.413]  I know they're evil.
[02:26:04.993 --> 02:26:06.074]  I face their evil.
[02:26:07.374 --> 02:26:13.057]  It's hard to admit to yourself just how great evil is, and that it's in the world, and then to
[02:26:14.136 --> 02:26:28.346]  And then to face it, to see those men and women there with their children facing it, to see these good people, to see the love in their eyes, to see the strength, to see the goodness, it must be protected.
[02:26:29.026 --> 02:26:35.590]  And then to see those wolves, to see those police and those agents and these servants of evil.
[02:26:36.571 --> 02:26:37.512]  They were bullies.
[02:26:37.552 --> 02:26:38.552]  They were ogres.
[02:26:38.632 --> 02:26:39.633]  They were thugs.
[02:26:40.734 --> 02:26:43.636]  And to see those serving the elite, to see their minions,
[02:26:44.545 --> 02:26:46.165]  To see how enslaved they are.
[02:26:46.185 --> 02:26:47.626]  I'm actually sad for them.
[02:26:47.686 --> 02:26:48.866]  I don't even hate them.
[02:26:49.886 --> 02:26:50.886]  And we'll be honest here.
[02:26:50.906 --> 02:26:52.746]  In the past, I do hate these people.
[02:26:53.027 --> 02:26:53.907]  I despise them.
[02:26:54.747 --> 02:26:58.027]  But it's far worse than that.
[02:26:58.307 --> 02:26:58.888]  I pity them.
[02:26:59.908 --> 02:27:00.488]  I pity them.
[02:27:00.528 --> 02:27:01.828]  They have lost so much.
[02:27:01.928 --> 02:27:05.949]  They have no idea how strong good is.
[02:27:06.029 --> 02:27:08.469]  They have no idea how deep it is.
[02:27:08.529 --> 02:27:11.510]  They have no idea how much God loves us.
[02:27:14.391 --> 02:27:16.032]  God loves us so much.
[02:27:17.833 --> 02:27:20.234]  God has so many great plans for us.
[02:27:20.874 --> 02:27:24.856]  And this evil, this evil is destroying our destiny.
[02:27:25.916 --> 02:27:27.057]  It's hurting the innocent.
[02:27:28.397 --> 02:27:29.858]  It's hurting the beautiful.
[02:27:35.460 --> 02:27:36.420]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.861 --> 02:27:38.481]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.382 --> 02:27:42.083]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.507 --> 02:27:52.794]  United States Pharmacopoeia, USP, sets the standard for most food supplements and are used in over 95% of all vitamin and mineral supplements in the world.
[02:27:52.975 --> 02:27:56.018]  The problem is that these products have never appeared in any living tissue.
[02:27:56.138 --> 02:27:59.501]  They're created in laboratories and are not recognizable to the body's metabolism.
[02:27:59.942 --> 02:28:07.189]  Grown by nature, products are different because they use re-natured ingredients, proprietary blends of essential vitamins and minerals with co-factors of proteins,
[02:28:07.369 --> 02:28:07.669]  We're good.
[02:28:29.517 --> 02:28:31.778]  That's 877-817-9829 because not all products are grown by nature, but they should be.
[02:28:45.379 --> 02:28:51.623]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:28:51.743 --> 02:28:57.906]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:28:58.207 --> 02:29:06.652]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:29:06.872 --> 02:29:13.896]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:29:14.216 --> 02:29:19.019]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:29:19.239 --> 02:29:24.643]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:29:25.003 --> 02:29:28.065]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:29:28.406 --> 02:29:36.371]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:36.411 --> 02:29:36.991]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:45.427 --> 02:29:49.830]  Local folklore has recognized its amazing medicinal properties for thousands of years.
[02:29:50.010 --> 02:29:55.675]  But no one knew just how to preserve the nutritional benefits and market the total fruit commercially until Zango, that is.
[02:29:56.055 --> 02:30:00.958]  Zango is made from mangosteen, a fruit that grows in the subtropical climates of Southeast Asia.
[02:30:01.219 --> 02:30:05.702]  It contains xanthomes, the highest concentration of antioxidants found in nature.
[02:30:06.002 --> 02:30:06.622]  We're good to go.
[02:30:06.662 --> 02:30:06.802]  I think?
[02:30:27.128 --> 02:30:28.749]  Unleash the power of Zango today.
[02:30:28.989 --> 02:30:30.129]  Find out more by calling 888-203-6633.
[02:30:30.149 --> 02:30:30.389]  That's 888-203-6633.
[02:30:30.429 --> 02:30:31.530]  Or visit www.mangosteenmarket.com.
[02:30:31.830 --> 02:30:32.930]  That's M-A-N-G-O-S-T-E-E-N market.com.
[02:30:32.950 --> 02:30:34.050]  We don't need no education.
[02:30:54.959 --> 02:31:11.474]  We don't need no thought control No dark sarcasm in the classroom Teacher, leave them kids alone
[02:31:28.689 --> 02:31:30.230]  Alright, we're back, my friends.
[02:31:33.313 --> 02:31:37.415]  My brothers, my sisters, all of you that love goodness and that hate evil.
[02:31:39.417 --> 02:31:41.598]  Just because we hate evil, we don't do it because we hate evil.
[02:31:41.878 --> 02:31:43.840]  We do it because we love our families.
[02:31:44.480 --> 02:31:45.961]  We love all that is good in the world.
[02:31:47.182 --> 02:31:52.786]  To try to describe the evils, the crimes, the wickedness, the stench, the rottenness,
[02:31:53.456 --> 02:32:00.360]  The rotten boil that is the New World Order, again, it's indescribable.
[02:32:02.081 --> 02:32:07.044]  And to see them revel in their wickedness is painful.
[02:32:09.305 --> 02:32:20.211]  And to wish that the wicked could only feel what it is to be good, but so many of them have hardened their hearts and have been totally given over to this wanton darkness
[02:32:21.934 --> 02:32:30.676]  And all they do is plunge like people falling off of a cliff into a bottomless chasm deeper and deeper into the dark.
[02:32:30.756 --> 02:32:31.597]  It's all they know.
[02:32:36.918 --> 02:32:37.698]  It's all they know.
[02:32:40.439 --> 02:32:42.439]  We've got to stand up against them.
[02:32:42.479 --> 02:32:44.040]  We've got to fight their crimes.
[02:32:44.100 --> 02:32:45.860]  We've got to shine the light on them.
[02:32:46.641 --> 02:32:47.201]  It is paramount.
[02:32:50.811 --> 02:32:51.731]  This is the crowd.
[02:32:52.152 --> 02:32:56.473]  This is the crowd that has killed millions all over the world.
[02:32:56.513 --> 02:32:59.574]  This is the crowd that funded the Soviets in Russia and in China.
[02:33:00.254 --> 02:33:02.855]  This is the crowd that carries out the terror attacks.
[02:33:02.895 --> 02:33:05.556]  This is the crowd that ships in the narcotics.
[02:33:06.136 --> 02:33:08.937]  This is the crowd that puts sodium stannous fluoride in your water.
[02:33:08.977 --> 02:33:12.018]  This is the crowd that puts mercury in your vaccines.
[02:33:12.679 --> 02:33:13.739]  There was one father there.
[02:33:13.759 --> 02:33:17.380]  He was the father that brought the bullhorn and he had his son with him.
[02:33:19.601 --> 02:33:19.701]  And
[02:33:20.544 --> 02:33:26.685]  He talked about how his smaller son has autism, and it's always the same story.
[02:33:27.406 --> 02:33:34.087]  How the little baby was fine and happy and learning and 100%, and then got the third round of shots, and they lost him.
[02:33:34.687 --> 02:33:35.288]  They lost him.
[02:33:35.668 --> 02:33:43.429]  That is, they lost him being fully conscious and being able to talk to him, and he went into that mercury poison-induced stupor.
[02:33:44.270 --> 02:33:45.310]  And I talk a lot about that.
[02:33:45.350 --> 02:33:46.670]  That's only one of their crimes.
[02:33:47.390 --> 02:33:49.791]  I mean, the globalists have used a bit of uranium.
[02:33:50.683 --> 02:34:00.831]  On three continents that we know of, they've in Iraq used the equivalent of 44,000 Hiroshima, or is it Nagasaki, A-bombs in our atmosphere.
[02:34:03.614 --> 02:34:06.796]  Every indicator of life is going down.
[02:34:06.856 --> 02:34:10.239]  Every indicator shows critical biosphere failure.
[02:34:13.121 --> 02:34:14.583]  The New World Order is doing this.
[02:34:14.623 --> 02:34:15.844]  These people are sick.
[02:34:16.784 --> 02:34:18.506]  They're doing it by design.
[02:34:20.854 --> 02:34:28.860]  And they are manifestly, totally, past the point of no return themselves.
[02:34:29.020 --> 02:34:36.845]  Just as I and many of you are past the point of no return in our attempt to be good and righteous and strong and honorable and upright.
[02:34:40.247 --> 02:34:42.409]  They strive to be evil.
[02:34:42.429 --> 02:34:43.910]  They strive to one-up each other.
[02:34:43.970 --> 02:34:45.331]  They revel in it.
[02:34:46.832 --> 02:34:49.594]  Let's play the little nine-minute clip of my bullhorning.
[02:34:49.654 --> 02:34:49.774]  It's...
[02:34:51.727 --> 02:35:04.049]  To be there, to be standing in front of that obelisk, to be standing in front of that occultic building filled with wickedness, and to hear, it doesn't do justice, but we'll play it nevertheless.
[02:35:04.089 --> 02:35:04.509]  Here it is.
[02:35:05.209 --> 02:35:06.970]  The people of the planet are free.
[02:35:07.610 --> 02:35:11.770]  Humans, since the beginning of civilization, have struggled against tyranny.
[02:35:12.551 --> 02:35:20.912]  We are here with a new Declaration of Independence, a declaration of free people on the planet Earth, resisting your tyranny.
[02:35:21.553 --> 02:35:23.235]  We do not want your American Union.
[02:35:23.815 --> 02:35:25.537]  We do not want your European Union.
[02:35:25.997 --> 02:35:31.482]  We wish to live in peace and be free, just as you wish to have your secret meetings and be left alone.
[02:35:32.483 --> 02:35:38.788]  We are here at great danger and great expense and with great courage to stand up against your enormous power.
[02:35:39.069 --> 02:35:40.410]  We know you are ruthless.
[02:35:40.730 --> 02:35:41.891]  We know you are evil.
[02:35:42.211 --> 02:35:43.693]  We respect your dark power.
[02:35:44.608 --> 02:35:49.872]  But you should know that as you attempt to set up your world government, you're facing greater and greater problems.
[02:35:49.932 --> 02:35:52.133]  Your agenda is faltering.
[02:35:52.794 --> 02:35:55.936]  Free humans everywhere know what you're doing.
[02:35:56.216 --> 02:35:58.337]  The people have woken up to what you're doing.
[02:35:59.258 --> 02:36:02.000]  You're attempting to shut down the Internet and the free press.
[02:36:02.080 --> 02:36:02.961]  You are failing.
[02:36:03.601 --> 02:36:04.962]  The cat is out of the bag.
[02:36:05.322 --> 02:36:08.384]  The truth of your world government has now been exposed.
[02:36:09.045 --> 02:36:11.026]  We will expose the New World Order.
[02:36:11.506 --> 02:36:13.728]  We will expose the Global Crime Syndicate.
[02:36:14.443 --> 02:36:20.949]  To David Rockefeller, to the Rothschild representatives here, to the Queen of the Netherlands, to all of you.
[02:36:21.029 --> 02:36:22.810]  We tell you, you are not our queens.
[02:36:23.010 --> 02:36:24.091]  You are not our kings.
[02:36:24.531 --> 02:36:25.632]  You are not our gods.
[02:36:26.073 --> 02:36:27.334]  We do not belong to you.
[02:36:27.674 --> 02:36:28.875]  We are not your slaves.
[02:36:29.275 --> 02:36:36.782]  We stand as free humans have stood since the beginning of time against the strong men, against the thugs, against the bullies.
[02:36:37.322 --> 02:36:41.285]  We are here telling you that we will resist the New World Order.
[02:36:41.645 --> 02:36:43.627]  We will defeat your world government.
[02:36:43.907 --> 02:36:45.948]  We will defeat world taxation.
[02:36:46.208 --> 02:36:48.390]  We will defeat your control grid.
[02:36:48.730 --> 02:36:49.911]  God is on our side.
[02:36:51.332 --> 02:37:15.933]  And I stand before the creator of the universe, and I ask the creator of the universe, as our founding fathers did in 1776, to lead, guide, and direct us, and to give us the power and the foresight and the understanding and the will to stand against your entire agenda, including your final plan of world population reduction of 80% that Henry Kissinger penned in 1973.
[02:37:18.894 --> 02:37:24.036]  We stand here as free human beings that love our families, that want to control our own destinies.
[02:37:24.736 --> 02:37:29.078]  I know that you have the excuses that you claim you have to have world government to stop World War.
[02:37:29.378 --> 02:37:37.041]  But in truth, architects of World War II are sitting in your building right now, like Queen Beatrice, her late husband, SS officer.
[02:37:38.157 --> 02:37:41.160]  We are here simply trying to defend liberty.
[02:37:41.741 --> 02:37:42.862]  You have threatened us.
[02:37:42.922 --> 02:37:44.184]  You have threatened our countries.
[02:37:44.224 --> 02:37:45.565]  You have threatened our sovereignty.
[02:37:45.825 --> 02:37:47.627]  You have threatened our livelihoods.
[02:37:48.088 --> 02:37:54.595]  Your world government and your own statements and your own policy reports are detrimental to the average man, woman, and child.
[02:37:55.652 --> 02:37:58.535]  You have more power and more money than you could ever spend.
[02:37:58.575 --> 02:38:00.637]  You own the central banks that print the money.
[02:38:01.178 --> 02:38:03.720]  Why then do you continue to try to dehumanize us?
[02:38:04.141 --> 02:38:06.002]  Why do you put mercury in the vaccines?
[02:38:06.323 --> 02:38:08.225]  Stanisodium fluoride in the water?
[02:38:08.965 --> 02:38:09.346]  Why?
[02:38:09.766 --> 02:38:12.129]  Why do you put cancer viruses in the vaccines?
[02:38:12.429 --> 02:38:16.193]  Why have you used depleted uranium now in four separate nations?
[02:38:16.883 --> 02:38:20.806]  The equivalent of 44,000 A-bombs of uranium now in the atmosphere.
[02:38:21.247 --> 02:38:22.267]  Why are you doing this?
[02:38:22.347 --> 02:38:23.448]  Why are you so dark?
[02:38:23.548 --> 02:38:24.889]  Why are you so destructive?
[02:38:25.270 --> 02:38:27.171]  Why are you destroying your own future?
[02:38:27.531 --> 02:38:28.252]  You're arrogant.
[02:38:28.632 --> 02:38:36.439]  You have the sickness that elites have had throughout history in their literal and, in some cases, figurative ivory towers.
[02:38:36.559 --> 02:38:38.120]  You believe that you're invincible.
[02:38:38.700 --> 02:38:40.562]  You are your own greatest enemy.
[02:38:41.269 --> 02:38:48.054]  You are an enemy of humanity and the human experience and everything that we are and everything that we could be.
[02:38:48.374 --> 02:38:51.316]  You are threatened by the dynamic human free spirit.
[02:38:51.556 --> 02:38:52.897]  You are monopoly men.
[02:38:53.217 --> 02:38:55.139]  You monopolize the economic system.
[02:38:55.159 --> 02:39:07.047]  You try to monopolize the spiritual systems because you're threatened by independent middle classes developing their own industries that you believe will threaten your monopoly of control and power.
[02:39:07.702 --> 02:39:12.424]  We hear the free peoples of earth stand against you and your wickedness.
[02:39:13.624 --> 02:39:15.225]  The numbers are growing every day.
[02:39:15.325 --> 02:39:18.266]  Millions of people every day wake up for what you're doing.
[02:39:18.886 --> 02:39:22.487]  They understand your program of control and they will resist it.
[02:39:23.068 --> 02:39:26.509]  Again, we implore the Creator of the universe to aid us.
[02:39:27.611 --> 02:39:36.337]  We pledge our lives, our bodies, our sacred honor, our treasure, all on the line against you, the neo-fascist corporate royalty.
[02:39:36.857 --> 02:39:40.099]  We tell you now that your abuse must end.
[02:39:40.499 --> 02:39:44.702]  We tell you now, listen to the voices inside Bilderberg that understand the truth.
[02:39:45.162 --> 02:39:50.085]  We tell you now that we know there's dissenting voices in your ranks who say that what you're doing is dangerous.
[02:39:50.305 --> 02:39:54.388]  You're hurtling the world towards World War IV, as you call it.
[02:39:55.598 --> 02:40:00.262]  We ask you to reconsider your wickedness and your evil.
[02:40:01.022 --> 02:40:03.364]  You are being led by a very dark force.
[02:40:03.945 --> 02:40:06.667]  You have been manipulated and deceived yourselves.
[02:40:07.307 --> 02:40:12.672]  You know at the end of your days now, many of you, that all the evil and all the power has not filled you.
[02:40:13.157 --> 02:40:13.537]  We're good to go.
[02:40:29.171 --> 02:40:30.953]  My life is overflowing.
[02:40:31.333 --> 02:40:33.035]  I am so incredibly happy.
[02:40:33.496 --> 02:40:34.417]  I am empowered.
[02:40:34.877 --> 02:40:36.699]  I am empowered by the life force.
[02:40:37.039 --> 02:40:40.163]  I am empowered by creativity and goodness and the light.
[02:40:40.803 --> 02:40:43.146]  You are filled with the black pits of hell.
[02:40:43.666 --> 02:40:46.850]  You are filled with darkness and it will never quench your thirst.
[02:40:47.446 --> 02:40:47.546]  Amen!
[02:40:47.566 --> 02:40:47.686]  Amen!
[02:40:47.746 --> 02:40:47.846]  Amen!
[02:40:47.947 --> 02:40:48.067]  Amen!
[02:40:48.147 --> 02:40:48.227]  Amen!
[02:41:22.812 --> 02:41:39.239]  The elite of the world, and that's you, have been waging war on the people, waging war on any free populations, attempting to create your world government, a monopoly of thought, a monopoly of science, a monopoly of finance.
[02:41:40.079 --> 02:41:42.260]  You are destroying this species.
[02:41:42.340 --> 02:41:44.301]  You are destroying our development.
[02:41:44.641 --> 02:41:46.782]  You are bad social engineers.
[02:41:47.922 --> 02:41:49.103]  You're like a lion.
[02:41:49.665 --> 02:41:55.727]  Who comes into the prime and goes after the cubs because you're threatened of them rising.
[02:41:56.127 --> 02:41:57.187]  You're threatened by them.
[02:41:57.527 --> 02:42:00.308]  You seek to feed on your own species.
[02:42:00.328 --> 02:42:06.730]  You're an upper predator class that is trying to engineer us and dumb us down so we're more easily fed upon.
[02:42:07.310 --> 02:42:10.050]  You will and you are failing now.
[02:42:10.631 --> 02:42:13.131]  Your new world order will fall.
[02:42:13.731 --> 02:42:15.712]  Humanity will defeat you.
[02:42:16.283 --> 02:42:19.804]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:42:21.745 --> 02:42:26.547]  The answer to your 1984 world is the world of 1776.
[02:42:26.987 --> 02:42:31.889]  The human spirit has always risen against tyranny.
[02:42:32.269 --> 02:42:35.030]  The human spirit has always overcome fear.
[02:42:35.410 --> 02:42:38.011]  The human spirit has always resisted the bully.
[02:42:38.412 --> 02:42:41.473]  And we are resisting you now as we will for eternity.
[02:42:42.133 --> 02:42:44.374]  Because ideas are bulletproof.
[02:42:45.234 --> 02:42:53.641]  And as we all hear standing our flesh and blood, the idea of human liberty and human freedom is bulletproof, and you will fail.
[02:42:54.041 --> 02:42:55.982]  Your children will rebel against you.
[02:42:56.263 --> 02:42:58.184]  Your wives will rebel against you.
[02:42:58.444 --> 02:43:00.746]  Your husbands will rebel against you.
[02:43:00.966 --> 02:43:11.014]  Because the truth and decency and freedom is beautiful and is wonderful, and it is the holy grail you've been seeking that's been right under your nose.
[02:43:11.514 --> 02:43:12.075]  Be good.
[02:43:12.819 --> 02:43:14.160]  Turn from your wicked ways.
[02:43:14.721 --> 02:43:16.222]  Say no to global government.
[02:43:16.262 --> 02:43:20.185]  Say no to engineering the human species into a slave state.
[02:43:20.685 --> 02:43:22.707]  Your tyranny has failed.
[02:43:22.947 --> 02:43:24.408]  You've already been defeated.
[02:43:24.608 --> 02:43:28.812]  You can already feel the rumblings as your supports crumble underneath you.
[02:43:29.092 --> 02:43:36.358]  The crises you thought you would create to bring in world government is the crisis that will undo your system.
[02:43:37.603 --> 02:43:38.703]  History shows it.
[02:43:39.043 --> 02:43:40.784]  You believe you're students of history?
[02:43:41.164 --> 02:43:41.964]  Look at history.
[02:43:42.304 --> 02:43:43.904]  You will reach your world government.
[02:43:43.944 --> 02:43:45.585]  You will gain your new world order.
[02:43:45.745 --> 02:43:49.906]  But right as you grasp it, you will feel the floor beneath you falling.
[02:43:50.386 --> 02:44:00.388]  At the very moment you gain the apex of your power, at the very moment you climb to the summit of that mountain, your defeat is ensured.
[02:44:01.068 --> 02:44:03.568]  What you seek is your undoing.
[02:44:04.229 --> 02:44:05.809]  You have been defeated.
[02:44:10.141 --> 02:44:11.902]  And that is part of what I said.
[02:44:11.922 --> 02:44:13.323]  It was a lot louder than that.
[02:44:13.383 --> 02:44:17.546]  The cameras were behind me with the bullhorn facing the building.
[02:44:17.766 --> 02:44:22.229]  So much of what you heard was simply my voice bouncing back over 200 yards.
[02:44:25.051 --> 02:44:28.774]  But the point is, that's how big things start.
[02:44:28.814 --> 02:44:29.774]  They start small.
[02:44:30.475 --> 02:44:32.937]  Just six years ago, I looked it up before I left.
[02:44:33.037 --> 02:44:36.319]  There had never been a mainstream news article in the United States about Bilderberg.
[02:44:37.304 --> 02:44:43.685]  Before 12 years ago, there had never been a mainstream news article about Bilderberg in the European press.
[02:44:43.765 --> 02:44:53.648]  And to be specific, in 1954, right after it was formed, there were two articles in a now-defunct New York newspaper about it.
[02:44:53.668 --> 02:44:56.128]  The famous newsman who learned of it didn't even know the name.
[02:44:56.388 --> 02:44:58.529]  They were meeting at Jekyll Island, I believe, for the second meeting.
[02:44:58.549 --> 02:45:01.749]  The first one was at Bilderberg, so I guess it was Bilderberg Hotel.
[02:45:01.769 --> 02:45:04.090]  I guess the second one was in Jekyll Island, so that would be 1955.
[02:45:07.049 --> 02:45:09.632]  But it had never been in our press since then.
[02:45:10.493 --> 02:45:13.355]  And then the media would say it doesn't exist.
[02:45:13.395 --> 02:45:20.522]  You're crazy if it's... I mean, I've had the New York Times say Alex Jones believes in a thing called Bohemian Grove and a place called, and a group called Bilderberg.
[02:45:20.582 --> 02:45:21.623]  You know, he's delusional.
[02:45:23.305 --> 02:45:24.225]  And now look at you.
[02:45:25.226 --> 02:45:29.951]  All over the Canadian newspapers, all over world newspapers, all over Canadian television.
[02:45:31.980 --> 02:45:35.681]  And it is chilling to realize that they were listening to this show.
[02:45:35.721 --> 02:45:36.961]  They knew I was going to Canada.
[02:45:37.341 --> 02:45:39.622]  They were there trying to block me from entering Canada.
[02:45:40.002 --> 02:45:43.162]  Their own customs admitted that the, quote, conference was concerned about me.
[02:45:43.963 --> 02:45:47.223]  You had them treat me so horribly bad, but again, it didn't hurt me.
[02:45:47.283 --> 02:45:48.824]  I just really felt sorry for them.
[02:45:49.384 --> 02:45:51.304]  These poor people were just trying to protect them.
[02:45:51.324 --> 02:45:53.985]  Those poor customs agents, they have families.
[02:45:55.225 --> 02:45:55.565]  They just...
[02:45:57.355 --> 02:46:00.296]  Before 50, 60 years ago, people didn't trust government.
[02:46:00.316 --> 02:46:02.696]  People knew government was corrupt and wicked throughout history.
[02:46:03.236 --> 02:46:05.757]  And then somehow they convinced us that evil doesn't exist.
[02:46:05.877 --> 02:46:09.058]  I guess it was the devil's biggest trick was convincing the world he didn't exist.
[02:46:09.758 --> 02:46:14.699]  And that, oh, any government corruption is a conspiracy theory, and nothing's going on, and go to sleep.
[02:46:15.339 --> 02:46:17.339]  And don't worry about it, and don't get involved.
[02:46:17.359 --> 02:46:18.820]  And now look at where we are today.
[02:46:20.060 --> 02:46:23.000]  Things are getting more and more dark, more and more serious by the minute.
[02:46:24.781 --> 02:46:25.321]  By the minute.
[02:46:27.688 --> 02:46:30.952]  I'm going to write some notes up tonight about what I want to talk about tomorrow.
[02:46:30.972 --> 02:46:34.416]  There's a lot of points I want to cover, but I haven't had a lot of sleep.
[02:46:35.317 --> 02:46:45.949]  I guess in the last one, two, three, four, five days, I've had about really two days of sleep if you added it all up, so I'm not at 100%, but I'll be back tomorrow.
[02:46:46.977 --> 02:46:49.519]  And I'll have my notes together and the points I do want to cover.
[02:46:49.539 --> 02:46:56.125]  There's a lot of facets, a lot of wrinkles, a lot of details that we will give you on the Bilderberg Group meeting.
[02:46:56.546 --> 02:47:01.730]  The Zarqawi, Abu Masab Zarqawi stuff, I mean, I could talk for an hour about that.
[02:47:01.950 --> 02:47:03.712]  That is totally false.
[02:47:03.812 --> 02:47:06.154]  That is total, 100% theater.
[02:47:07.335 --> 02:47:13.941]  Just like the Saddam Brothers, and then they said, oh, it's really wax figurines or private...
[02:47:16.039 --> 02:47:17.380]  We're good to go.
[02:47:17.400 --> 02:47:17.860]  I think?
[02:47:42.423 --> 02:47:43.884]  And there's no retraction in the news.
[02:47:43.944 --> 02:47:47.545]  Oh, those other three times we didn't really kill him, we killed him this time.
[02:47:48.766 --> 02:47:50.967]  In fact, again, they're testing us.
[02:47:51.027 --> 02:47:54.328]  Right out in the open, the mainstream media is doing this.
[02:47:54.889 --> 02:47:55.929]  There's not even words.
[02:47:56.449 --> 02:47:58.110]  You claim you kill him over and over again?
[02:47:58.130 --> 02:48:04.293]  I guess now they've shown us the bodies, so this may be the final one, and I predicted it to myself in the hotel room.
[02:48:04.333 --> 02:48:10.656]  I said, well, by tomorrow they'll be introducing the other number two guy, the head of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan.
[02:48:11.323 --> 02:48:12.064]  We're good to go.
[02:48:45.407 --> 02:48:53.669]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here, and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[02:48:53.869 --> 02:48:56.190]  We're expecting around 1,000 people in attendance.
[02:48:56.810 --> 02:49:05.633]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[02:49:06.173 --> 02:49:09.696]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda.
[02:49:10.136 --> 02:49:30.934]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Tarpley, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[02:49:31.254 --> 02:49:34.997]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[02:49:35.457 --> 02:49:36.698]  Arm yourself with the truth.

[02:50:04.372 --> 02:50:04.612]  I think.
[02:50:20.871 --> 02:50:21.351]  That's right.
[02:50:21.551 --> 02:50:28.653]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.

[02:51:51.465 --> 02:51:59.707]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:59.787 --> 02:52:04.888]  Love is a burning thing, and it makes a fiery ring.
[02:52:07.369 --> 02:52:08.529]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:52:10.250 --> 02:52:11.670]  We're into the final segment again.
[02:52:11.690 --> 02:52:12.290]  We're live.
[02:52:12.350 --> 02:52:14.211]  It is Monday, the 12th day.
[02:52:17.094 --> 02:52:18.495]  Of June 2006.
[02:52:21.697 --> 02:52:26.419]  Think about how many times we've been lied to by both parties, by the leaders of both parties.
[02:52:26.459 --> 02:52:29.401]  How many times we know it was premeditated lying.
[02:52:31.122 --> 02:52:32.483]  Manufacturing news.
[02:52:32.763 --> 02:52:33.804]  Staging whole events.
[02:52:33.824 --> 02:52:34.504]  And they get caught.
[02:52:35.064 --> 02:52:36.685]  It's in the back of the paper if you're lucky.
[02:52:36.765 --> 02:52:38.146]  Everybody just moves on.
[02:52:40.808 --> 02:52:43.869]  What must it be like to be one of those Bilderberg group members?
[02:52:44.170 --> 02:52:44.590]  They're not
[02:52:45.379 --> 02:52:46.020]  We're good to go.
[02:53:14.932 --> 02:53:18.453]  But to try to make us more fallen.
[02:53:18.573 --> 02:53:23.454]  To be threatened by individualism and happiness and beauty and strength.
[02:53:23.714 --> 02:53:24.754]  I mean, they really are.
[02:53:25.854 --> 02:53:26.474]  They hate you.
[02:53:27.855 --> 02:53:28.395]  They hate you.
[02:53:28.435 --> 02:53:30.955]  They come to kill, steal, and destroy because they're of their father.
[02:53:30.975 --> 02:53:31.776]  And you know who that is.
[02:53:33.536 --> 02:53:35.416]  And it really is spiritual at the end of the day.
[02:53:35.856 --> 02:53:37.037]  The elite is into the occult.
[02:53:37.157 --> 02:53:39.117]  They are into dark mysticism.
[02:53:39.137 --> 02:53:41.298]  They're far beyond gone.
[02:53:44.795 --> 02:53:48.617]  And on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com, we do have big reports for you.
[02:53:49.637 --> 02:53:51.758]  The complete list of the Bilderberg Group is up there.
[02:53:51.778 --> 02:53:54.380]  A video of some of my bullhorning.
[02:53:54.400 --> 02:53:55.340]  More will go up tomorrow.
[02:53:57.481 --> 02:53:57.861]  Photos.
[02:53:57.882 --> 02:53:59.822]  We're going to put more photos up in the next few days.
[02:54:00.963 --> 02:54:01.783]  We've got all these.
[02:54:01.823 --> 02:54:03.104]  I shot like 40 hours.
[02:54:03.224 --> 02:54:04.225]  Roughly 40 hours.
[02:54:05.505 --> 02:54:06.666]  That's right at 40 hours.
[02:54:07.466 --> 02:54:08.287]  While I was there.
[02:54:08.307 --> 02:54:12.869]  I don't even at the end of this broadcast feel like plugging something, but
[02:54:14.338 --> 02:54:14.878]  We're good to go.
[02:54:44.324 --> 02:54:52.228]  That just this little broadcast with your help has already moved mountains and know what we could do that would just dwarf that.
[02:54:52.808 --> 02:54:54.669]  God has given us the tools we need.
[02:54:54.729 --> 02:54:55.970]  It is in our hands.
[02:54:56.030 --> 02:54:58.631]  It is in our court.
[02:54:59.572 --> 02:55:12.819]  It is up to us for the people to take action and to have goodness and strength and love in their hearts and to do the hard things and make the hard decisions because once you start down this road, it will just open into a whole new world for you.
[02:55:15.738 --> 02:55:17.159]  This has been a journey for myself.
[02:55:17.239 --> 02:55:19.420]  I'm not perfect.
[02:55:21.222 --> 02:55:21.902]  None of us are.
[02:55:22.382 --> 02:55:30.688]  And so many people think that we have to save the world by ourselves or if we're going to take action, we've got to be perfect and we've got to have all the answers and we've got to do a flawless job.
[02:55:30.728 --> 02:55:31.828]  And that's not true.
[02:55:33.930 --> 02:55:43.856]  And I see so many people in our movement who are either provocateurs or egomaniacs or in it for other reasons and I'm just so sad for them because they're missing out on what life's all about.
[02:55:45.106 --> 02:55:47.808]  So I thank God for the opportunity to be born.
[02:55:48.368 --> 02:55:53.692]  Thank God for my parents, for my great-grandparents, for their great-great-great-grandparents, for everyone.
[02:55:54.272 --> 02:56:08.242]  And for all of you out there, for our AM and FM affiliates, the folks running the show, Ted Anderson, John Harmon, my team, Ryan Slickheisen and Aaron Dykes that bravely went through hell and went with me to Ottawa.
[02:56:09.102 --> 02:56:13.465]  To cover the Bilderberg Group 2006, Jim Tucker was an amazing character and person.
[02:56:14.065 --> 02:56:14.925]  Spent a lot of time with him.
[02:56:14.965 --> 02:56:16.126]  We'll tell you more about that tomorrow.
[02:56:16.686 --> 02:56:18.147]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:18.607 --> 02:56:19.968]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:20.609 --> 02:56:21.369]  God bless you all.
