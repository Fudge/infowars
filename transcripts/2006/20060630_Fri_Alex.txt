[00:00:05.581 --> 00:00:06.221]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.882 --> 00:00:07.942]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.643 --> 00:00:09.784]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.424 --> 00:00:11.244]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.985 --> 00:00:12.885]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:17.248]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.728 --> 00:00:21.871]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.891 --> 00:00:23.972]  Music
[00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.073]  TGIF, ladies and gentlemen, I'm glad it's Friday.
[00:00:38.093 --> 00:00:39.514]  I need a rest this weekend.
[00:00:40.435 --> 00:00:50.283]  I'm only going to be working about six hours a day on Saturday and Sunday, finishing up trying to work on the cover for the official Terror Storm and the extras.
[00:00:51.894 --> 00:00:56.415]  Trying to upload as much video from the big 9-11 conference we had out in L.A.
[00:00:56.435 --> 00:00:59.896]  last weekend for the members at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:06.377]  Also, some several hour-long compilations that we're going to load to Google Video that will be loaded today.
[00:01:07.058 --> 00:01:09.898]  Now, that's the way to start a radio broadcast, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:09.918 --> 00:01:12.699]  Just kind of some daily notes here around the office.
[00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:15.500]  Thank you so much for tuning in.
[00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.981]  We have Colonel Ronald D. Ray, U.S.
[00:01:20.021 --> 00:01:21.381]  Marine Corps Retired.
[00:01:22.498 --> 00:01:28.001]  And Colonel Ray is a practicing attorney in Kentucky and a highly decorated combat veteran of the Vietnam War.
[00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:30.502]  Two silver stars and a bronze star and a purple heart.
[00:01:30.922 --> 00:01:38.486]  He served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense during the Reagan Administration and was appointed by President Bush to serve on the American Battle Monuments Commission.
[00:01:39.452 --> 00:01:44.535]  That's the first President Bush, and was on the 92 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces.
[00:01:45.035 --> 00:01:50.078]  From 90 to 94, he served as military historian and deputy director of field operations for the U.S.
[00:01:50.098 --> 00:01:51.399]  Marine Corps Historical Center.
[00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:59.604]  Washington, D.C., Colonel Ray selected for who's who in America and in American law, writes and speaks on a wide range of national security.
[00:02:00.144 --> 00:02:02.626]  You wouldn't believe the private discussions we've had.
[00:02:03.306 --> 00:02:05.628]  We'll see if he wants to talk about that on air.
[00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.070]  You don't want to miss this interview.
[00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:22.102]  Historical and congressional issues, and has appeared on a variety of national television news broadcasts, ABC World News Tonight, Lyric King Live, Hattie & Combs, Fox & Friends, The Today Show, Fox News, Crossfire, and a number of national radio broadcasts.
[00:02:22.482 --> 00:02:23.683]  He'll be joining us today.
[00:02:23.723 --> 00:02:25.064]  He defended Michael Noob.
[00:02:26.886 --> 00:02:31.310]  He, of course, was the attorney for Admiral Moore, the late Admiral Moore.
[00:02:32.438 --> 00:02:38.362]  And he is a good friend of Major General Carl Black that we had on a few weeks ago.
[00:02:38.382 --> 00:02:43.206]  He'll be discussing the destruction of our military, the UN, and the New World Order.
[00:02:44.647 --> 00:02:47.709]  Yes, the New World Order.
[00:02:47.990 --> 00:03:00.879]  We'll be talking with the military's former head historian for the Pentagon about the New World Order, that thing that some people are still in very, very serious trouble
[00:03:03.107 --> 00:03:04.388]  Denial about.
[00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.190]  So he'll be joining us coming up in the next hour.
[00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:16.916]  And then my good buddy Bob Dacey, who has written for the New American Magazine, has a local TV show.
[00:03:17.456 --> 00:03:26.942]  He has done an incredible job detailing the NAFTA End of America Toll Road Foreign Controlled Grid.
[00:03:28.286 --> 00:03:32.490]  And here's his headline today, an InfoWars.com exclusive.
[00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.091]  I hope you'll get it out to everybody.
[00:03:35.673 --> 00:03:36.594]  It's the law.
[00:03:36.614 --> 00:03:42.279]  Feds pave the way to toll and privatize the interstate highways.
[00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:47.203]  And we will be getting into what President Bush has now done with that.
[00:03:50.638 --> 00:03:52.740]  The American Union is upon us.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.765]  We will be discussing it with Bob Dacey in studio in the third hour.
[00:03:58.145 --> 00:04:01.669]  By the way, as soon as we get time, we're busy uploading video of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:02.770]  It's already up there for you.
[00:04:03.751 --> 00:04:08.976]  Up close, video we shot of David Rockefeller, Queen Beatrix, and others.
[00:04:09.336 --> 00:04:14.041]  By up close, we shot it from 200 yards away of the Super Zoom, but it's up close of their fat heads.
[00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:15.770]  We're good to go.
[00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.931]  I think?

[00:04:55.395 --> 00:04:55.755]  All right.
[00:04:55.876 --> 00:04:57.558]  Masses of news on the other side.
[00:04:57.598 --> 00:04:58.079]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.252 --> 00:05:08.076]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny on DVD.
[00:05:08.396 --> 00:05:09.777]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:05:09.977 --> 00:05:12.178]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:12.318 --> 00:05:14.419]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:19.622]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:19.962 --> 00:05:24.004]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:05:24.244 --> 00:05:26.025]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:05:26.085 --> 00:05:36.750]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.791]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:05:39.011 --> 00:05:42.853]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[00:05:42.953 --> 00:05:44.514]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.

[00:06:02.321 --> 00:06:03.361]  The war on terrorism.
[00:06:03.681 --> 00:06:06.462]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:06.742 --> 00:06:10.884]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:11.324 --> 00:06:12.144]  So what do you do?
[00:06:12.464 --> 00:06:17.046]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:17.526 --> 00:06:19.607]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:34.840]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:42.005]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[00:07:01.041 --> 00:07:03.364]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:07:03.624 --> 00:07:05.646]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:07:05.806 --> 00:07:12.854]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[00:07:13.134 --> 00:07:21.683]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[00:07:22.023 --> 00:07:26.709]  Now for the first time, Calbin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.

[00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:59.091]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[00:08:00.891 --> 00:08:03.492]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.052 --> 00:08:06.833]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.513 --> 00:08:15.457]  Joining us in the third hour today, Bob Dacey writes for the New American Magazine.
[00:08:15.937 --> 00:08:17.638]  He's written an exclusive for us.
[00:08:17.799 --> 00:08:18.679]  It's the law.
[00:08:18.779 --> 00:08:25.704]  Feds pave the way to toll and privatize the interstate highways under the NAFTA plan.
[00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:28.586]  The American Union program.
[00:08:29.147 --> 00:08:30.768]  In fact, I know my guys are listening right now.
[00:08:30.808 --> 00:08:35.031]  Let's add that to Bob's headline as part of or...
[00:08:36.718 --> 00:08:44.926]  I mean, add something like, as part of American Union, add something to it, because people won't get past the headline.
[00:08:44.986 --> 00:08:46.707]  It's an excellent article that Bob's written.
[00:08:47.088 --> 00:08:49.971]  He'll be joining us coming up in the third hour.
[00:08:50.471 --> 00:08:58.759]  We do have, of course, the lawyer for Michael Noob joining us, and he's worked at every level inside the Pentagon and the Marine Corps.
[00:09:00.267 --> 00:09:01.187]  He will be joining us.
[00:09:01.247 --> 00:09:03.769]  Colonel Ronald D. Ray, U.S.
[00:09:03.809 --> 00:09:07.631]  Marine Corps, retired, will be joining us coming up in the next hour.
[00:09:07.711 --> 00:09:10.613]  And believe me, you don't want to miss this interview.
[00:09:11.433 --> 00:09:16.817]  We've talked to him a lot off air about several key issues that we cover quite a bit here, hint, hint.
[00:09:16.937 --> 00:09:21.840]  And let me just tell you, this guy is tuned in and knows exactly what's going on.
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.961]  He'll be discussing the New World Order.
[00:09:25.074 --> 00:09:27.460]  And the UN takeover of our military.
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.650]  That's two of the main issues that he'll be joining us to discuss.
[00:09:31.931 --> 00:09:34.497]  There'll be a few surprise issues as well.
[00:09:35.643 --> 00:09:39.405]  Death toll, at least 16 for northeast floods.
[00:09:39.905 --> 00:09:42.806]  Evacuations lifted for 200,000.
[00:09:44.487 --> 00:09:48.088]  Rivers crest, expecting to begin lowering now, thank God.
[00:09:48.108 --> 00:09:49.889]  But they're saying more rain could come.
[00:09:50.429 --> 00:09:53.351]  Iran brushes aside deadline on response.
[00:09:53.431 --> 00:09:57.132]  Bush is threatening, basically, to attack them here in the next week and a half or so.
[00:09:57.192 --> 00:09:58.693]  They do not follow all of their orders.
[00:09:59.553 --> 00:10:00.194]  Defense tech...
[00:10:01.054 --> 00:10:03.396]  Magazine has an interesting little headline here.
[00:10:03.576 --> 00:10:05.357]  All seeing blimp on the rise.
[00:10:06.177 --> 00:10:08.099]  And they're very sarcastic in the article.
[00:10:08.159 --> 00:10:08.939]  I love this article.
[00:10:09.019 --> 00:10:19.986]  It says, The problem with the American military today is that it doesn't have a giant robotic airship two and a half times the size of the Goodyear blimp that can watch over an entire city at once.
[00:10:20.086 --> 00:10:24.930]  Thankfully, the Pentagon's way-out research arm DARPA is trying to fix that.
[00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:28.512]  And they then go into a really scary article about it.
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:30.260]  So we'll be getting into that.
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.982]  AP reports that Guard to miss Border Patrol mission deadline.
[00:10:34.962 --> 00:10:48.867]  Yeah, last time I checked, there's a couple hundred troops in Texas and Arizona and New Mexico, Southern California, standing around with no weapons, only allowed to call Border Patrol when they see what they can, quote, confirm to be illegals.
[00:10:49.487 --> 00:10:51.028]  The same thing the Minutemen have done, and then...
[00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:52.391]  We're good to go.
[00:11:01.541 --> 00:11:05.884]  Out of Health and Science from Yahoo News from Reuters.
[00:11:06.584 --> 00:11:09.986]  Young girls should get cancer vaccine, panel says.
[00:11:10.006 --> 00:11:19.572]  Of course, what they don't tell you is that many of the cancers we now struggle with today are caused by viruses put in the vaccines.
[00:11:19.612 --> 00:11:27.016]  They tell you by accident, but the documents and the scientific research shows by design in most cases, if not all cases.
[00:11:27.136 --> 00:11:30.938]  So, we've seen cancer up several thousand percent today.
[00:11:31.757 --> 00:11:33.618]  From what it was 50 years ago.
[00:11:34.138 --> 00:11:36.658]  In some cases up even more than 2,000%.
[00:11:37.719 --> 00:11:41.200]  We see cancer up around 500% just in the last decade.
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:49.102]  Other forms of cancer like cervical cancer and breast cancer are just at incredibly high levels.
[00:11:49.462 --> 00:11:57.524]  And these are cancers directly linked to viral infections, viral attacks.
[00:11:58.507 --> 00:11:59.868]  We're good to go.
[00:12:28.507 --> 00:12:32.608]  And your body defeats these viruses that are naturally occurring in the environment every day.
[00:12:32.628 --> 00:12:37.489]  But these designer viruses are causing big problems as I'm sure you know.
[00:12:39.069 --> 00:12:44.770]  And so now they've got a vaccine that will block the cervical cancer virus.
[00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:54.692]  And if you take this ladies and gentlemen if young ladies take this you are completely and totally insane.
[00:12:55.845 --> 00:13:07.255]  Of course, they say that you get this cervical cancer from promiscuity, and clearly, take India with the SV40 virus that's been around for over 40 years, and it's still being found in polio vaccines, by the way.
[00:13:08.278 --> 00:13:26.064]  Oh yes, even though the new polio vaccine is not connected to the tissue cultures that originally had the SV40, which they said was an accident, they've done big studies in India where they find it in every sewer system and they find it in every major communal system.
[00:13:27.727 --> 00:13:38.387]  That's because the entire population of India has SV40 in their blood, even though most of the population of India has not had the polio oral vaccine.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:50.664]  So, yes, it is true that the population here in the United States, male and female, many of us, are carrying the cervical cancer virus.
[00:13:50.785 --> 00:13:52.285]  Even if you're male, you can carry it.
[00:13:52.605 --> 00:13:56.287]  And then males transfer it to women in unprotected sex.
[00:13:56.347 --> 00:13:59.008]  But it's also originating in the vaccines.
[00:13:59.028 --> 00:14:02.349]  And every time they do a study of a vaccine, it's got this type of stuff in it.
[00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:04.130]  So you're crazy, ladies.
[00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:08.272]  There are hundreds of viruses that have been found, cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[00:14:09.032 --> 00:14:12.694]  And just how any of you would take the vaccines, I will never understand.
[00:14:13.094 --> 00:14:16.676]  It is totally and completely insane to take any of these.
[00:14:17.216 --> 00:14:18.077]  But we'll be getting into this.
[00:14:18.137 --> 00:14:20.558]  Young girls should get cancer, vaccine panel says.
[00:14:20.838 --> 00:14:23.940]  They're talking about making it one of the, quote, mandatory.
[00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:32.524]  Or, you know, they claim it's mandatory, but really it's a regulatory push they have where they try to force you to take it.
[00:14:32.844 --> 00:14:38.267]  Girls as young as 9 and young women up to age 26 should be able to get the Merck company's
[00:14:39.111 --> 00:14:39.871]  We're good to go.
[00:14:57.191 --> 00:15:09.261]  Young girls, age 11 to 12, girls and women, age 13 to 26, who have not received the vaccine yet, and women who have had abnormal pap smears, genital warts, or certain other conditions.
[00:15:11.042 --> 00:15:13.464]  Because, again, what causes warts, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:15:13.684 --> 00:15:14.425]  Viruses.
[00:15:14.885 --> 00:15:17.988]  And this is ridiculous, though.
[00:15:18.028 --> 00:15:21.831]  If they don't do the test for the virus and it's not there...
[00:15:22.811 --> 00:15:23.532]  You wouldn't need it.
[00:15:24.232 --> 00:15:24.972]  This is insane.
[00:15:25.533 --> 00:15:29.395]  At their discretion, physicians could vaccinate as young as nine.
[00:15:29.435 --> 00:15:30.256]  The panel decided.
[00:15:30.556 --> 00:15:38.842]  The group also voted to include the vaccine and the federal vaccines for children program under which the government buys vaccines for uninsured or poor school children.
[00:15:39.302 --> 00:15:40.443]  I want to stop right there.
[00:15:40.703 --> 00:15:42.104]  I want to spend some time on this.
[00:15:42.424 --> 00:15:43.925]  This is important.
[00:15:46.627 --> 00:15:48.688]  I'm just going to give you a little prelude.
[00:15:49.784 --> 00:16:16.296]  Two years ago, Times of London, London Independent, London Guardian, all reported that the official medical board in England recommended forced vaccination of the entire young population, school age population, ages 5 to 18, to go to school, trying to force them, of a vaccine with a live virus in it,
[00:16:17.421 --> 00:16:27.292]  That would precipitate viral death, tissue death, electrochemical receptor sites.
[00:16:28.113 --> 00:16:35.782]  To make a long story short, the virus goes into the brain and actually attacks the receptors on the neurons.
[00:16:36.756 --> 00:16:37.337]  Don't believe me?
[00:16:37.397 --> 00:16:37.797]  Go read it.
[00:16:38.297 --> 00:16:41.840]  They are on the verge of making, and it's being studied in the U.S., by the way.
[00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:45.402]  We found a BBC article and an ABC article about it here domestically.
[00:16:45.422 --> 00:16:46.963]  Well, one was foreign.
[00:16:46.984 --> 00:16:48.044]  About the U.S., one was domestic.
[00:16:48.324 --> 00:16:49.385]  But they're also looking at it here.
[00:16:49.786 --> 00:16:50.806]  And over my dead body.
[00:16:51.607 --> 00:16:55.149]  Folks, forcing an injection on you, and what do they say?
[00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:56.250]  This brain damaging?
[00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:57.351]  This is a lobotomy, folks.
[00:16:57.891 --> 00:17:02.695]  A specific, localized, a specific sector of the brain will be lobotomized.
[00:17:03.357 --> 00:17:14.084]  The sites in the brain, the receptors that receive endorphins, the sites that trigger endorphins, the sites that receive endorphins.
[00:17:15.365 --> 00:17:18.067]  And after I give a good speech, I get a flood of endorphins.
[00:17:18.107 --> 00:17:19.148]  I don't need to take drugs.
[00:17:19.208 --> 00:17:20.309]  It's all in the mind.
[00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:21.550]  Gone.
[00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:21.950]  Gone.
[00:17:22.691 --> 00:17:26.494]  It will affect all the receptors that take in narcotics and opiates.
[00:17:27.134 --> 00:17:33.199]  That includes nicotine, cocaine, heroin, and all of the natural chemicals.
[00:17:33.799 --> 00:17:35.661]  That's what heroin and cocaine and all that mirrors.
[00:17:36.141 --> 00:17:37.742]  Real endorphins, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:38.863 --> 00:17:42.606]  I mean, it's not a good thing, but it's built into us, I guess, for defense.
[00:17:42.686 --> 00:17:51.893]  But, you know, when somebody knocks you upside the head and you fire back with double barrels, you know, you slam them, and then when they hit the ground, you get that feeling of,
[00:17:52.697 --> 00:17:54.539]  Exhilaration of exaltation.
[00:17:55.539 --> 00:17:56.200]  You boost.
[00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.381]  That's your brain going, good job, victory.
[00:18:00.003 --> 00:18:01.163]  All of that will be gone.
[00:18:01.223 --> 00:18:05.286]  But don't worry, they say they'll have drugs to then treat you for depression.
[00:18:05.847 --> 00:18:06.688]  And I'm not kidding.
[00:18:07.068 --> 00:18:08.509]  You could not make this stuff up.
[00:18:08.629 --> 00:18:10.290]  No one could make this up.
[00:18:11.031 --> 00:18:18.276]  This is when you score the touchdown, make the business deal, kiss the beautiful woman when you drop her off from that first date.
[00:18:18.576 --> 00:18:20.097]  You dreamed of dating for a year.
[00:18:20.458 --> 00:18:21.979]  You get that exhilaration.
[00:18:23.106 --> 00:18:23.867]  I think we're good to go.
[00:18:23.907 --> 00:18:24.547]  I think we're good to go.
[00:18:50.322 --> 00:18:56.383]  Lord Bortz, and I've never put the video on the web of Bortz cussing at me and laughing at me at Ground Zero a few years ago.
[00:18:56.403 --> 00:18:57.763]  I ought to dig that out and do that.
[00:18:58.904 --> 00:19:00.864]  I didn't want to really give the guy attention.
[00:19:00.884 --> 00:19:01.924]  It was kind of diversionary.
[00:19:02.984 --> 00:19:08.225]  But we will talk about that with Jack Blood after we go to this quick break.
[00:19:08.245 --> 00:19:10.326]  We'll come back and get Jack's take on it.
[00:19:10.346 --> 00:19:16.767]  I want to thank Jack for sitting in for me, what, three, four days last week, and then a couple days before that, whenever I was in...
[00:19:18.277 --> 00:19:21.959]  Up in Canada, covering the Bilderberg Group.
[00:19:22.439 --> 00:19:25.621]  So he will give us an update on Bortz.
[00:19:27.182 --> 00:19:28.623]  They're doing a full court press.
[00:19:28.663 --> 00:19:33.185]  I'm told Laura Ingram had Professor Jim Fetzer on this morning and wouldn't let him talk.
[00:19:33.886 --> 00:19:34.526]  Because they can't.
[00:19:34.606 --> 00:19:35.867]  They can't let us put facts out.
[00:19:36.247 --> 00:19:39.029]  All they can do is yell and scream and freak out and play Twilight Zone music.
[00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:42.691]  And I'm told Bortz tried to make fun of me and kept giving my website out.
[00:19:43.131 --> 00:19:47.013]  Hey, keep it up, Bortz, because they'll come here, they'll find the truth,
[00:19:48.248 --> 00:19:50.029]  They'll find out we're trying to save people.
[00:19:50.049 --> 00:19:52.191]  We're trying to warn people on a thousand issues.
[00:19:52.651 --> 00:19:54.033]  They'll find out we're the good guys.
[00:19:54.053 --> 00:19:58.336]  And they'll find out that you are a liberal communist in sheep's clothing.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.122]  We understand that decisions related to health can be overwhelming.
[00:20:05.382 --> 00:20:12.187]  That is why at ResearchedHerbs.com we take pride in offering you herbs whose safety and effectiveness have been proven time and time again.
[00:20:12.627 --> 00:20:25.996]  For example, did you know that Live52, the top-selling natural herbal supplement for liver diseases since 1930, is backed by over 300 research studies and clinical trials and prescribed by more than 200,000 health professionals worldwide?
[00:20:26.296 --> 00:20:30.039]  In fact, the effectiveness of all the herbs featured on ResearchedHerbs.com
[00:20:30.387 --> 00:20:31.447]  We're good to go.
[00:20:31.467 --> 00:20:31.728]  I think?
[00:21:06.844 --> 00:21:10.128]  Currency devaluation, inflation, one and the same.
[00:21:10.848 --> 00:21:14.833]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:21:21.095 --> 00:21:21.835]  We're good to go.
[00:21:21.855 --> 00:21:22.075]  I think?
[00:21:44.986 --> 00:21:45.206]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:02.369 --> 00:22:06.872]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:22:07.233 --> 00:22:11.316]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:22:11.596 --> 00:22:12.156]  We listened.
[00:22:12.456 --> 00:22:17.460]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:18.201]  We listened.
[00:22:18.601 --> 00:22:21.623]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:22:22.063 --> 00:22:22.584]  We listened.
[00:22:23.044 --> 00:22:27.108]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:22:27.488 --> 00:22:27.989]  We listened.
[00:22:28.329 --> 00:22:33.554]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:22:33.974 --> 00:22:35.335]  Again, we listened.
[00:22:35.696 --> 00:22:43.082]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:22:43.462 --> 00:22:46.926]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter for only $259 by calling
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:53.921]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:22:53.941 --> 00:22:55.523]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:23:07.551 --> 00:23:09.132]  Spoonful of sugar, right?
[00:23:09.352 --> 00:23:10.732]  That's an embarrassing pastime.
[00:23:10.912 --> 00:23:12.173]  Have a changed woman, Tom.
[00:23:12.433 --> 00:23:15.494]  I found the products at OPCpure.com to be exceptional.
[00:23:15.694 --> 00:23:20.636]  They're all-natural, energy-giving supplements, restore your body's health, and keeps you going without groggy side effects.
[00:23:20.976 --> 00:23:22.736]  Spoonful of OPCpure.com, huh?
[00:23:22.916 --> 00:23:24.137]  Oh, I love the sound of that.
[00:23:24.357 --> 00:23:27.558]  Just a spoonful of OPCpure.com helps the energy go up.
[00:23:27.918 --> 00:23:29.899]  Pure, unadulterated, raw energy.
[00:23:30.059 --> 00:23:30.559]  Go for it.
[00:23:31.739 --> 00:23:34.200]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.481]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:23:37.287 --> 00:23:40.468]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:23:41.108 --> 00:23:47.591]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[00:23:48.371 --> 00:23:50.572]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[00:23:50.952 --> 00:23:51.372]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:51.472 --> 00:23:52.853]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:24:08.385 --> 00:24:11.127]  Of course, I'm being sarcastic when I say Neil Bortz is a communist.
[00:24:11.147 --> 00:24:13.328]  The point is, is he's not a real conservative.
[00:24:14.388 --> 00:24:19.331]  And I've listened to the guy for many years, and he would just get so old.
[00:24:19.992 --> 00:24:25.555]  And then at ground zero to have him walk up to me while I'm talking to police and others and go, you're full of bleeping, bleeping.
[00:24:26.415 --> 00:24:30.718]  And then I'd try to talk to him, and he'd go, you've got to pay me thousands of dollars to talk to you.
[00:24:30.738 --> 00:24:32.579]  And just really obnoxious.
[00:24:32.619 --> 00:24:34.039]  And he wouldn't debate 9-11 with me.
[00:24:34.079 --> 00:24:35.000]  He couldn't debate it.
[00:24:36.357 --> 00:24:41.260]  But Jack Blood, I guess this morning, was listening to KLBJ, which is a fine station.
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.821]  I'm actually going to start a talk show over there on the weekends.
[00:24:44.021 --> 00:24:47.923]  We're trying to move it into syndication through Emmis with Genesis.
[00:24:48.363 --> 00:24:53.566]  We're just starting off with that in the interim because I'm too busy to do another weeknight show over there that I've been offered.
[00:24:54.190 --> 00:25:01.615]  But Jack Blood, what did you hear Lord Bortz, the neocon in conservatives' clothing, what did you hear him doing today?
[00:25:02.155 --> 00:25:19.647]  Well, you know, it's painful, Alex, but I monitor some of these programs so I can understand exactly what we're up against, and spent a lot of time last night watching Ann Coulter, yes, talking about Rush Limbaugh getting busted for Prozac, or sorry, probably Prozac too, Viagra,
[00:25:20.091 --> 00:25:21.151]  Hey Jack, back off your phone a little.
[00:25:49.065 --> 00:25:50.708]  They also talked about loose change.
[00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:59.285]  He also made references that you say that, or you might as well be saying that black helicopters crashed into the World Trade Center towers.
[00:26:00.186 --> 00:26:15.443]  It was pretty ridiculous, and I've got to tell you, one of the things I noticed is they're probably putting on the collars that are least able to articulate what happened on 9-11 in order to embarrass anybody that might be a quote-unquote conspiracy theorist.
[00:26:15.483 --> 00:26:22.070]  But he dropped all the general buzzwords and made a lot of fun of it, and him and his buddy both looked up
[00:26:22.674 --> 00:26:27.317]  Yeah, one of the callers called in, and I think, you know, this is good, but, you know, you can't just do this.
[00:26:27.517 --> 00:26:31.119]  One of the callers called in and said, well, Larry Silverstein said, pull the building.
[00:26:51.574 --> 00:27:03.103]  And this is when Neil Bortz went on a tirade about how he meant pull the firefighters from the building, and he even admitted that this is a commonly used term in demolition for pulling the building.
[00:27:03.123 --> 00:27:07.066]  No, we have firefighters on record now saying that they were told, get out of the building that day.
[00:27:07.126 --> 00:27:08.527]  We have Giuliani saying that.
[00:27:08.827 --> 00:27:11.129]  We have the clear squibs, the blast points.
[00:27:11.209 --> 00:27:13.250]  It falls in a controlled demolition.
[00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:15.952]  It wasn't even hit by debris from the North Tower.
[00:27:15.972 --> 00:27:16.933]  It had two small...
[00:27:17.273 --> 00:27:25.598]  Yeah, I understand that Neil Boris is just a talking head and doesn't understand the simplest application of physics, but obviously anyone who looked at that building knew that it didn't fall from the few fires it had.
[00:27:25.858 --> 00:27:30.161]  Well, we now have two different samples confirmed that thermite was used, specifically thermate, the type used to cut steel,
[00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:47.411]  And, I mean, we've got him dead to rights.
[00:27:48.011 --> 00:27:55.033]  Yeah, of course, and he's not going to bring that up, but obviously we would all love to see you get on that program and give him a real debate.
[00:27:55.053 --> 00:28:03.595]  If he has such a good case, Alex, and maybe some of the listeners that are going to call into Neil Bortz next week might bring this up to him if he's not on vacation all week.
[00:28:04.497 --> 00:28:05.118]  Or the next week.
[00:28:05.378 --> 00:28:15.554]  You know, bring up the fact that if he is so sure of his case and he is such a great debater and such an amazing talk show host, why, what does he have to lose to bring Alex Jones on the air?
[00:28:16.374 --> 00:28:20.716]  Well, I'll clean his clock, but what they do... Fox has set me up three times.
[00:28:20.756 --> 00:28:25.018]  They always cancel it and put somebody up weaker, because I will savage them.
[00:28:25.498 --> 00:28:28.339]  I will point out when they're trying to cover up or won't let me talk.
[00:28:28.719 --> 00:28:33.201]  Fetcher's really good on air, and Kevin heard it this morning with him on Laura Ingram.
[00:28:33.522 --> 00:28:34.982]  She would not let him talk.
[00:28:35.042 --> 00:28:36.843]  She would not let him say a single word.
[00:28:37.543 --> 00:28:43.066]  Well, Alex, I will be happy to debate any of these people as well, and since they don't know me as well as they know you, who knows?
[00:28:43.146 --> 00:28:45.947]  Maybe it's a potential to get our foot in the door here, but...
[00:28:46.368 --> 00:28:48.169]  Look, I mean, we know what they do.
[00:28:48.209 --> 00:28:49.430]  They put on the worst callers.
[00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:50.431]  So why don't we do this?
[00:28:50.831 --> 00:28:51.511]  We call in.
[00:28:51.572 --> 00:28:56.775]  We can go 9-11 and get on the air and then give them the real thing.
[00:28:56.795 --> 00:28:59.337]  Well, you know, I've actually gotten into national shows like that.
[00:28:59.957 --> 00:29:04.120]  I'll call in and I'll go, I don't like Bush and he did it at 9-11.
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:07.342]  And then they put me on and I'm just suddenly, you know, attacking.
[00:29:07.802 --> 00:29:10.324]  And then when you get on, talk about the Northwoods document.
[00:29:10.364 --> 00:29:16.088]  Talk about the 1993 World Trade Center sting operation, which is mainstream news and highly documented.
[00:29:16.488 --> 00:29:18.452]  You know, talk about the real issues of Building 7.
[00:29:18.793 --> 00:29:21.618]  Talk about the new thermate evidence and the physics.
[00:29:21.658 --> 00:29:26.828]  Talk about whistleblowers like William Rodriguez, Sybil Edmonds, Mary Schneider, okay?
[00:29:27.389 --> 00:29:28.091]  Kevin Ryan.
[00:29:28.809 --> 00:29:29.389]  That's right.
[00:29:29.989 --> 00:29:32.110]  Drop names like Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:32.670]  That's right.
[00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:37.191]  The individuals that underwrote the building are saying the official story is impossible.
[00:29:37.231 --> 00:29:38.631]  But let's not listen to engineers.
[00:29:39.011 --> 00:29:40.871]  Hey, Jack, thanks a lot for popping in with us.
[00:29:41.131 --> 00:29:41.832]  Have a good weekend.
[00:29:42.052 --> 00:29:42.392]  You bet.
[00:29:42.412 --> 00:29:42.812]  Take care.
[00:29:43.172 --> 00:29:45.232]  We'll be right back with your calls at Town & News.
[00:29:45.812 --> 00:29:46.313]  Stay with us.
[00:29:46.333 --> 00:29:47.553]  This is Genesis Communications.
[00:29:51.654 --> 00:29:52.534]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.034 --> 00:29:54.634]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.554 --> 00:29:58.235]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.502 --> 00:30:02.203]  We're good to go.
[00:30:22.182 --> 00:30:28.488]  Modern science is only just beginning to unlock the many secrets of Xanthos and their far-reaching potential to improve our health.
[00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:30.330]  Zango is revolutionary.
[00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:40.540]  Not only has Zango taken the world by storm as an extremely potent functional health beverage, but Zango has become the most exciting and fastest growing home-based business opportunity ever.
[00:30:40.841 --> 00:30:42.983]  Life is short and timing is everything.
[00:30:43.323 --> 00:30:44.945]  Unleash the power of Zango today.

[00:32:09.114 --> 00:32:13.798]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:32:14.139 --> 00:32:21.706]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:22.106 --> 00:32:28.968]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:29.188 --> 00:32:30.589]  There are no side effects.

[00:32:50.496 --> 00:32:53.458]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:32:53.478 --> 00:32:55.119]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.441]  Alright, welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:29.001 --> 00:33:31.642]  We're going to go to some of your calls coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:33:31.762 --> 00:33:37.504]  Paul in London, Scott in Virginia, Brian in Georgia, John in Texas, Denny in Kansas City, Missouri.
[00:33:38.004 --> 00:33:39.264]  Or is he in Kansas City, Kansas?
[00:33:39.284 --> 00:33:39.884]  We'll find out.
[00:33:41.765 --> 00:33:51.548]  Before I get back into the news and your calls, just to make this clear, I have completed the film Terror Storm.
[00:33:52.668 --> 00:33:53.088]  It's done.
[00:33:55.596 --> 00:34:04.924]  Now I'm working on the extras, but I don't want to wait a month while I finish the extras and send it off to be mass duplicated and put in a pretty case.
[00:34:05.945 --> 00:34:08.667]  I don't want to wait a month and not put the DVD out.
[00:34:08.707 --> 00:34:18.155]  This information is so important that we're putting out the American Scholar Symposium version because that's the menu that this special edition has at the beginning.
[00:34:18.855 --> 00:34:19.596]  It is the film.
[00:34:19.656 --> 00:34:24.680]  In fact, it's got about four minutes in it that has been cut out of the final version.
[00:34:25.566 --> 00:34:26.606]  That will have the extras.
[00:34:27.186 --> 00:34:31.928]  And so for $19.95, you get a film that's a little under two hours long.
[00:34:34.508 --> 00:34:35.649]  It is my best work.
[00:34:36.269 --> 00:34:37.949]  There aren't a lot of copies left.
[00:34:38.549 --> 00:34:42.490]  We printed some of these up, and when they're gone, they're gone.
[00:34:43.411 --> 00:34:46.031]  You really want to get this DVD.
[00:34:46.111 --> 00:34:46.672]  Terror Storm.
[00:34:46.692 --> 00:34:48.412]  We get into the history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:34:48.792 --> 00:34:49.512]  We go to London.
[00:34:49.532 --> 00:34:51.993]  We cover the London bombing, proving that it was an inside job.
[00:34:52.997 --> 00:34:56.718]  We then look at the British SAS carrying out terror attacks in Iraq.
[00:34:57.538 --> 00:35:00.759]  We show how that is all staged and what's really behind the war.
[00:35:01.319 --> 00:35:06.961]  Then we go to Crawford and show the mindless neocon worshippers believing WMDs have been found.
[00:35:07.001 --> 00:35:21.725]  We interview Cindy Sheehan, Ray McGovern, former MI5 agents Andy Michon and David Shaler, Member of Parliament Michael Meacher, Professor Stephen Jones, former Chief Economist, Department of Labor Morgan Reynolds.
[00:35:23.745 --> 00:35:24.906]  Charlie Sheen.
[00:35:24.946 --> 00:35:29.349]  We get into 9-11 with the very latest info on the thermite, the thermate.
[00:35:30.109 --> 00:35:37.834]  And then we get into Mind Control, Double Speak, Double Think, Orwell, Eber Bernays, the father of modern propaganda and public relations.
[00:35:40.235 --> 00:35:45.919]  Graham Reynolds, who's done the music for several major motion pictures like Scanner Darkly, did the music on this film.
[00:35:46.559 --> 00:35:49.421]  We had professional graphics done by...
[00:35:50.501 --> 00:35:52.182]  Michael McWhorter throughout the film.
[00:35:52.683 --> 00:35:54.564]  Rob Jacobson did a great job on the editing.
[00:35:55.345 --> 00:36:01.049]  To give you an idea, I almost spent, I keep saying three times, I almost spent four times what my other films have cost me to make.
[00:36:03.091 --> 00:36:04.112]  And I keep saying ten months.
[00:36:04.152 --> 00:36:09.316]  It was really eleven months to start putting this film together and to complete it.
[00:36:10.697 --> 00:36:14.780]  So there's limited copies available, and when those are gone, you'll have to wait until the official DVD comes.
[00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:15.930]  We're good to go.
[00:36:31.952 --> 00:36:35.635]  Sometime next week we sell out of them, but your orders have come in, or your mail order comes in.
[00:36:35.655 --> 00:36:37.636]  We'll print a few more to cover those.
[00:36:37.676 --> 00:36:41.019]  But when it's done, it's done, and we won't sell anymore.
[00:36:41.119 --> 00:36:43.701]  So get Terror Storm now.
[00:36:43.981 --> 00:36:52.968]  Get your DVD now, ladies and gentlemen, and get Martial Law, an order of death while you're at it, there on InfoWars.com via the SafeSecure online shopping cart.

[00:36:59.713 --> 00:37:01.134]  We need to spread the word on this film.

[00:37:04.479 --> 00:37:05.299]  Fifteen cents a day.
[00:37:05.339 --> 00:37:07.340]  That just lets us pay for the bandwidth.
[00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:13.522]  And we're in the process of upping its bandwidth now because every few months we end up maxing it out and we have to increase it.
[00:37:14.702 --> 00:37:15.102]  Go there.
[00:37:15.162 --> 00:37:15.763]  Download it.

[00:37:55.244 --> 00:37:58.365]  They can answer your questions and tell you about different specials.
[00:37:58.385 --> 00:37:59.025]  888-253-3139.
[00:37:59.065 --> 00:38:00.766]  Or you can just write to me.
[00:38:00.846 --> 00:38:03.246]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[00:38:11.357 --> 00:38:12.738]  Take action, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:12.818 --> 00:38:15.000]  Get your copy of Terror Storm today.
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:19.083]  3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:38:22.525 --> 00:38:28.750]  Getting back into vaccines and then to your calls, young girls should get cancer vaccine panel tests.
[00:38:29.551 --> 00:38:36.376]  And they admit that the cervical cancer is being caused at epidemic levels by a cancer virus.
[00:38:37.355 --> 00:38:57.229]  Then you learn the cancer viruses have been predominantly, the majority of them, introduced through vaccines that are then picked up and then excreted onto services and people also pass them person to person or through sexual contact or IV sharing of needles, intravenous needle sharing.
[00:39:00.052 --> 00:39:11.279]  So they create the crisis again, and then they have the solution, a vaccine that blocks this virus in the body, which of course is, I guess, the dead virus teaching your body how to deal with it.
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:14.982]  There will, of course, be untold problems with this vaccine that they're pushing and promoting.
[00:39:15.342 --> 00:39:19.665]  The globalists are social-darwinistic mouthists who openly say that 85-95% of us must die.
[00:39:19.685 --> 00:39:20.105]  It ranges from...
[00:39:23.867 --> 00:39:28.208]  In different papers, the globalists have written all these different world leaders from 80% to 99%.
[00:39:29.068 --> 00:39:32.029]  But the general numbers are around 85% right now.
[00:39:32.049 --> 00:39:35.029]  That's kind of the average.
[00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:42.331]  And we have caught the United Nations in over 100 countries.
[00:39:42.371 --> 00:39:43.031]  Let me say that again.
[00:39:43.071 --> 00:39:46.772]  This is mainstream Reuters, BBC, going back now seven years.
[00:39:46.812 --> 00:39:48.412]  And it broke in the news again two years ago.
[00:39:50.643 --> 00:40:01.954]  In India, major scientific firms and the government began to test vaccines, and they found that particularly the tetanus shot, but they found it in others, in a UN program that they only wanted administered for women.
[00:40:02.394 --> 00:40:12.823]  Imagine the UN comes and says, we have this decade-long program, it's just for women because we care so much about women, we're liberal, we're loving, women are disadvantaged, we want to help you get medical care first.
[00:40:13.064 --> 00:40:13.965]  Oh, how loving!
[00:40:15.286 --> 00:40:16.527]  Notice, that's a key point there.
[00:40:18.556 --> 00:40:19.197]  This is admitted.
[00:40:19.237 --> 00:40:19.757]  You understand?
[00:40:19.917 --> 00:40:20.417]  Admitted!
[00:40:20.437 --> 00:40:24.000]  So you think about this next time you roll your sleeve up.
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:26.502]  Ladies and gentlemen, you take your kids in and you'll be given shots.
[00:40:27.022 --> 00:40:28.083]  Just for women.
[00:40:28.103 --> 00:40:29.484]  The UN wants to pay for it.
[00:40:29.844 --> 00:40:31.626]  They care about you.
[00:40:33.207 --> 00:40:34.748]  And so they go and they test it.
[00:40:35.248 --> 00:40:36.089]  First India did it.
[00:40:36.909 --> 00:40:39.791]  And guess what they find in the tetanus shots for the women?
[00:40:40.652 --> 00:40:43.454]  They find a synthetic female hormone.
[00:40:45.395 --> 00:40:47.377]  A very expensive hormone, by the way, to make.
[00:40:49.492 --> 00:40:51.213]  Bound to the tetanus.
[00:40:51.713 --> 00:40:52.334]  Pathogen.
[00:40:53.454 --> 00:40:55.135]  Bound... Yes, Kevin, what's up?
[00:40:55.235 --> 00:40:56.656]  You need something?
[00:40:56.676 --> 00:40:57.056]  Oh, cool.
[00:40:57.116 --> 00:40:57.577]  You want the phone?
[00:40:57.617 --> 00:40:57.877]  Here it is.
[00:40:57.897 --> 00:40:58.637]  I have it right here.
[00:40:59.077 --> 00:41:00.538]  I was going to use the phone during the break, so I have it.
[00:41:01.419 --> 00:41:02.119]  I need it during the break.
[00:41:02.479 --> 00:41:02.719]  Okay.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:03.840]  It's fine.
[00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:05.841]  It's kind of like I heard people running around in here.
[00:41:06.382 --> 00:41:07.742]  Let me go back to what I was saying.
[00:41:07.782 --> 00:41:09.303]  Let me go back to what I was discussing.
[00:41:11.745 --> 00:41:12.445]  So, we're in India.
[00:41:12.465 --> 00:41:12.565]  India.
[00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:16.651]  And the Indian government, I guess, it's really eight years ago now.
[00:41:16.791 --> 00:41:17.331]  Time is flying.
[00:41:17.611 --> 00:41:20.852]  About eight years ago, they go in with several private universities and they test it.
[00:41:21.172 --> 00:41:31.955]  And they find this very expensive synthetic female hormone that has nothing to do with the production processes of the tetanus vaccine in a program only administered to women by the U.N.
[00:41:33.135 --> 00:41:41.221]  And they raised this to the UN, and the study finds that it's 100% sterilization when the woman takes the vaccine.
[00:41:41.261 --> 00:41:53.469]  Now, it's a horrible form of sterilization because the woman is able to become pregnant, and then at around two months, the hormone is then excreted by the female glands in the body.
[00:41:54.589 --> 00:42:02.795]  The hormone is only in production during the end of the first trimester, and it causes a violent miscarriage.
[00:42:03.692 --> 00:42:04.112]  All right.
[00:42:05.774 --> 00:42:06.274]  And the U.N.
[00:42:06.294 --> 00:42:07.715]  said, oh, it's just an accident.
[00:42:08.015 --> 00:42:11.398]  And then the Indian government went and tested it from other manufacturers.
[00:42:11.458 --> 00:42:12.198]  It turned out the U.N.
[00:42:12.238 --> 00:42:13.659]  had used a bunch of different manufacturers.
[00:42:13.679 --> 00:42:18.083]  And they said, well, why is it in different lots from different manufacturers?
[00:42:18.163 --> 00:42:21.806]  And then different governments, Tanzania tested it.
[00:42:23.327 --> 00:42:27.390]  What's that other African country that will pop in my head in a second?
[00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:29.131]  They tested it.
[00:42:30.492 --> 00:42:31.793]  Several African countries tested it.
[00:42:31.893 --> 00:42:33.114]  And sure enough,
[00:42:33.843 --> 00:42:35.204]  They did this just a few years ago.
[00:42:35.425 --> 00:42:56.725]  Sure enough, there is the female hormone, the exact expensive synthetic hormone added and bound to the tetanus so that as soon as your body starts producing that, there is an autoimmune response and the body actually attacks those glands, a lot of times causing cancer in that gland itself because of the autoimmune response.
[00:42:57.425 --> 00:43:11.731]  It literally causes an attack in that area, an autoimmune response in that area, rotting out those glands, and a lot of times women get sick, a lot of times they die on top of it, so it also a lot of times kills the woman, but it always causes a miscarriage.
[00:43:13.051 --> 00:43:14.392]  What a perfect bioweapon.
[00:43:14.412 --> 00:43:23.615]  I mean, it doesn't just sterilize them, it causes horrible medical complications every time they get pregnant, and the woman's going to get pregnant over and over again, and chances are she's going to die from it as well.
[00:43:24.184 --> 00:43:28.668]  So go ahead, roll up your sleeves, and take the new shot they want your girls to take.
[00:43:29.649 --> 00:43:34.152]  Go ahead, roll up your sleeves and take the shot they want your girls to take.
[00:43:34.593 --> 00:43:35.393]  Go ahead.
[00:43:35.413 --> 00:43:38.135]  They're going to tell them that there's a move on now.
[00:43:38.215 --> 00:43:39.136]  It's right here in Reuters.
[00:43:39.717 --> 00:43:43.540]  There's a move on now to make this be, quote, mandatory.
[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:44.461]  That's all color of law.
[00:43:44.481 --> 00:43:45.381]  It really isn't mandatory.
[00:43:45.722 --> 00:43:47.323]  And make your girls take it.
[00:43:48.533 --> 00:43:49.914]  And so don't listen to me.
[00:43:50.095 --> 00:43:51.155]  Trust your government.
[00:43:51.195 --> 00:43:52.236]  They wouldn't carry out 9-11.
[00:43:53.177 --> 00:43:56.020]  They wouldn't put sodium and stannous chloride in the water.
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:44:03.766]  They wouldn't put genetically engineered organisms into the food that cause one out of three Americans to now have diabetes.
[00:44:03.967 --> 00:44:04.887]  It's not the sugar, folks.
[00:44:04.907 --> 00:44:05.888]  That's not the main cause.
[00:44:06.509 --> 00:44:07.350]  Just trust them.
[00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:08.370]  Don't believe me.
[00:44:08.651 --> 00:44:10.272]  I know in your guts you know I'm telling the truth.
[00:44:10.292 --> 00:44:11.693]  I know a lot of you have checked out what I've claimed.
[00:44:11.713 --> 00:44:12.294]  You know it's true.
[00:44:12.574 --> 00:44:13.435]  But just don't believe me.
[00:44:14.261 --> 00:44:15.163]  Believe Rush Limbaugh.
[00:44:15.404 --> 00:44:16.305]  Believe Neil Bortz.
[00:44:16.606 --> 00:44:17.568]  Believe Laura Ingraham.
[00:44:17.808 --> 00:44:18.690]  Believe all the liberals.
[00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:19.912]  Believe the Ford Foundation.
[00:44:19.932 --> 00:44:20.333]  Believe them!
[00:44:20.694 --> 00:44:21.435]  Just believe them!
[00:44:22.036 --> 00:44:22.878]  Fine, I'm making it up.
[00:44:22.938 --> 00:44:23.159]  Fine.
[00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:25.511]  The world's not that evil.
[00:44:25.571 --> 00:44:26.712]  Things aren't that bad.
[00:44:27.853 --> 00:44:30.736]  Leukemias in young children aren't up several thousand percent.
[00:44:31.176 --> 00:44:32.658]  DU isn't in our atmosphere.
[00:44:32.718 --> 00:44:36.842]  Lung cancer isn't up six times in the last ten years from the last number.
[00:44:37.162 --> 00:44:42.447]  They're claiming it's secondhand smoke when actual smoking's down, but now they claim secondhand smoke's causing six times the lung cancer.
[00:44:42.647 --> 00:44:44.029]  No, folks, it's the DU and other things.
[00:44:44.597 --> 00:44:45.897]  Just go ahead.
[00:44:45.917 --> 00:44:47.058]  Do use nutritious.
[00:44:47.678 --> 00:44:50.239]  We've got newscasts where they say mercury is good for you.
[00:44:50.559 --> 00:44:53.360]  Everybody knows it's deadly for brain development, especially in children.
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:55.741]  But don't listen to the University of Calgary.
[00:44:56.021 --> 00:45:00.342]  Don't listen to top scientific firms saying it's deadly for the brain.
[00:45:01.542 --> 00:45:02.683]  In fact, people don't believe me.
[00:45:03.123 --> 00:45:05.984]  Can you find the newscasts where they say mercury is good for the children's brains?
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:07.560]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:08.000]  Here it is.
[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:10.421]  This is local CBS, but this aired all over the country.
[00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:12.822]  It was a news feed where they tell the locals what to produce.
[00:45:12.862 --> 00:45:13.902]  This aired all over the country.
[00:45:14.102 --> 00:45:17.063]  This is the Austin version of it, where mercury is good for you.
[00:45:17.083 --> 00:45:17.423]  Here it is.
[00:45:17.803 --> 00:45:20.244]  Mercury-containing vaccines may have on kids.
[00:45:20.624 --> 00:45:23.825]  A receiving device wins over-the-counter approval by the FDA.
[00:45:24.425 --> 00:45:26.485]  And sick of your glasses and contact lenses?
[00:45:26.565 --> 00:45:29.246]  A new corrective eye surgery is approved today.
[00:45:29.266 --> 00:45:32.827]  Here's tonight's medical headlines with medical watch reporters from the Mappers.
[00:45:35.308 --> 00:45:41.312]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[00:45:41.752 --> 00:45:48.216]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives in vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[00:45:48.656 --> 00:45:55.620]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[00:45:57.902 --> 00:46:01.124]  And did they miss the first, or did I just miss it?
[00:46:03.625 --> 00:46:04.646]  Okay, good, so everybody heard it.
[00:46:06.033 --> 00:46:07.935]  Well, I remember the report.
[00:46:07.955 --> 00:46:14.102]  Two different government reports that said, Oh, actually, we've done a study, and mercury's good for your child's brain.
[00:46:15.084 --> 00:46:18.908]  Now, boys and girls, it is the most deadly metal.
[00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:23.273]  For some reason, we've had scientists on about this.
[00:46:23.293 --> 00:46:24.474]  We've read the reports on air.
[00:46:24.494 --> 00:46:25.656]  For some reason, mercury...
[00:46:26.363 --> 00:46:32.388]  Normal heavy metals, other varieties of heavy metals, just toxify the brain, kill cells on contact.
[00:46:32.928 --> 00:46:35.570]  Mercury creates an electrochemical response.
[00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:42.135]  We have video clips from major universities on Infowars.com, and it shows even the smallest trace amounts of mercury.
[00:46:42.715 --> 00:46:44.176]  They go up against the neuron.
[00:46:44.376 --> 00:46:45.157]  It shorts out.
[00:46:45.257 --> 00:46:46.138]  It explodes.
[00:46:46.198 --> 00:46:46.818]  It fries.
[00:46:46.858 --> 00:46:47.699]  They're electrochemical.
[00:46:48.119 --> 00:46:50.681]  And then the mercury moves on and migrates.
[00:46:50.721 --> 00:46:53.443]  So it just keeps eating through like an acid.
[00:46:53.963 --> 00:47:03.090]  Normal heavy metals, just like lead, arsenic, things of that nature, they just precipitate out in the brain and create plaques that do cause problems.
[00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:11.496]  One of the biggest things associated with Alzheimer's is just after 60, 70 years, you've built up a lot of these heavy metals and you finally get such a toxic load that it starts causing major brain death.
[00:47:12.811 --> 00:47:15.613]  And aluminum's really bad, folks, but at least it doesn't migrate.
[00:47:15.633 --> 00:47:17.535]  It doesn't just keep burning through.
[00:47:18.015 --> 00:47:19.476]  Mercury does.
[00:47:20.537 --> 00:47:29.183]  And by the third round of shots that children get by 18 months, that's why most autistic cases, you know, the toddler's fine, 18 months old, talking, running around, giggling, laughing, having a wonderful life.
[00:47:29.543 --> 00:47:31.445]  You get the third round of shots within two days.
[00:47:31.625 --> 00:47:36.168]  On average, I've talked to hundreds of families, and it's in the reports, the child curls up in the corner and is gone forever.
[00:47:36.812 --> 00:47:37.592]  Third round of shots.
[00:47:38.132 --> 00:47:47.054]  The government's mercury, it's designed to cause lesions and a basic 20-point on average IQ reduction in the general population.
[00:47:47.634 --> 00:47:56.996]  Just to dumb you down, some children, they've actually found a gene where there's an even higher level of mercury absorption through the blood-brain barrier.
[00:47:57.016 --> 00:47:57.876]  This is all scientific.
[00:47:58.376 --> 00:48:02.297]  And so with that large group, but it is a minority, it completely...
[00:48:02.977 --> 00:48:04.378]  Fries their poor little brains.
[00:48:04.458 --> 00:48:06.759]  So, again, roll your sleeves up.
[00:48:07.099 --> 00:48:08.440]  Trust the government.
[00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:10.440]  I'm lying to you.
[00:48:11.121 --> 00:48:12.782]  Mercury is good.
[00:48:13.822 --> 00:48:16.243]  You see, we're the normal people on this radio show.
[00:48:17.003 --> 00:48:18.284]  We know they blew those buildings up.
[00:48:18.812 --> 00:48:19.212]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:48:47.933 --> 00:48:49.735]  I know it sounds like a science fiction movie.
[00:48:49.995 --> 00:48:52.397]  It's 2006, and it's a nightmare.
[00:48:54.939 --> 00:48:56.800]  And I've put my life on the line for this, folks.
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:59.642]  I've been through a lot to warn you and come here and give you this warning.
[00:48:59.682 --> 00:49:01.984]  So if you're out there laughing at me right now, listen to me.
[00:49:02.124 --> 00:49:02.805]  Don't laugh.
[00:49:03.445 --> 00:49:05.727]  Before you laugh, you go check out my claims.
[00:49:06.007 --> 00:49:08.449]  And then I want you to face it, and I want you to find out it's true.
[00:49:10.788 --> 00:49:11.328]  Think about it.
[00:49:11.729 --> 00:49:14.450]  We have an elite in power openly trying to kill you.
[00:49:14.730 --> 00:49:22.954]  Remember Dr. Pionk at UT saying 90% of us need to die, and 95%, according to even mainstream media reporters that were there, stood up and clapped for him?
[00:49:24.795 --> 00:49:26.576]  There's a bunch of other professors that push this.
[00:49:26.716 --> 00:49:27.717]  They are the majority.
[00:49:28.197 --> 00:49:28.817]  Why do you think?
[00:49:28.837 --> 00:49:29.998]  Because they're giving the funding.
[00:49:30.018 --> 00:49:33.000]  Because the elite are the progenitors of this idea.
[00:49:35.161 --> 00:49:37.522]  Now, I know it's scary, and I know it's hard to deal with.
[00:49:38.044 --> 00:49:42.849]  This is why I decided to sacrifice my blood, my treasure, my life if need be in this fight.
[00:49:42.889 --> 00:49:44.491]  I fully know the danger I'm in.
[00:49:44.851 --> 00:49:46.192]  I fully have counted the cost.
[00:49:46.513 --> 00:49:50.577]  And I decided it's a very good price to pay if we can save people and turn this around.
[00:49:51.117 --> 00:49:57.924]  Words do not describe how out of control, psychotic, genius evil this elite is.
[00:49:57.984 --> 00:49:58.825]  Do you understand me?
[00:50:02.014 --> 00:50:12.441]  The people we're dealing with are totally psychopathic and all they talk about and all they do is attempt to set up a world government so they can orderly kill us.
[00:50:12.661 --> 00:50:13.702]  Let me say it again.
[00:50:14.042 --> 00:50:16.904]  The world government is only a means to an end.
[00:50:17.504 --> 00:50:26.230]  The world government is a global cashless society police state control grid for the orderly extermination of the human population.
[00:50:26.858 --> 00:50:28.580]  Don't say you haven't been warned.
[00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:31.702]  Don't say we haven't written articles with all the documents in it.
[00:50:32.143 --> 00:50:33.924]  Don't say nobody told you.
[00:50:34.304 --> 00:50:42.351]  Don't say when you're in your house flopping around, vomiting your guts out, ten years from now when they hit us with a megabio attack, I mean the big one, not some little prelude.
[00:50:43.472 --> 00:50:47.135]  Don't say I didn't warn you when you're dying and your whole family's dying.
[00:50:48.016 --> 00:50:49.037]  I don't want to be right.
[00:50:49.337 --> 00:50:50.138]  I want to stop them.
[00:50:51.939 --> 00:50:54.922]  Police, government, all of you listening, you know in your guts...
[00:50:55.979 --> 00:50:57.020]  You know the hunch.
[00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:59.342]  I got the evidence, but you know I'm telling the truth.
[00:51:02.424 --> 00:51:09.790]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:14.814]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:51:15.034 --> 00:51:20.679]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:51:20.919 --> 00:51:25.421]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:51:25.662 --> 00:51:32.805]  The cashless society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:51:32.825 --> 00:51:37.368]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.528 --> 00:51:40.049]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:51:40.269 --> 00:51:46.973]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:51:47.213 --> 00:51:48.234]  Or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:48.254 --> 00:51:48.475]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:52:03.064 --> 00:52:14.331]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[00:52:14.551 --> 00:52:20.995]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[00:52:21.235 --> 00:52:22.517]  To below detectable levels.
[00:52:22.797 --> 00:52:26.741]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[00:52:26.961 --> 00:52:33.489]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.

[00:54:31.693 --> 00:54:38.516]  And you can check it out for yourself, or you can just sit there and suck your thumb and buy into the dog and pony show that is the false left-right paradigm.
[00:54:38.816 --> 00:54:39.856]  Paul in London, England.
[00:54:39.876 --> 00:54:40.737]  Thanks for holding, Paul.
[00:54:40.757 --> 00:54:41.317]  You're on the air.
[00:54:42.417 --> 00:54:43.037]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:54:43.438 --> 00:54:43.698]  Hi.
[00:54:43.858 --> 00:54:52.121]  There's so many things to cover, but first of all, can I just recommend that your listeners get hold of a book called The Politics of Cancer, revisited by Dr. Samuel Epstein.
[00:54:53.038 --> 00:54:56.800]  And that would explain a lot of the things that you said, but from an independent viewpoint.
[00:54:56.900 --> 00:55:05.544]  Well, in the 20s and 30s, the Rockefellers actually bought up all the big cancer hospitals and then developed the viruses, the cancer viruses then, and began distributing them.
[00:55:05.564 --> 00:55:06.885]  But go ahead, that's mainstream news.
[00:55:07.585 --> 00:55:09.006]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:55:09.626 --> 00:55:15.729]  As far as that story in the Times is concerned, I remember that then announcing that they wanted to vaccinate every child.
[00:55:15.749 --> 00:55:20.852]  They actually said only a few days ago that they want to put every child in the UK on a national database.
[00:55:21.687 --> 00:55:23.088]  Now, remember those articles, though.
[00:55:23.128 --> 00:55:25.589]  It said a virus will then attack the brain.
[00:55:25.609 --> 00:55:26.409]  Did it not say that?
[00:55:26.970 --> 00:55:27.270]  It did.
[00:55:27.530 --> 00:55:28.090]  It did indeed.
[00:55:28.891 --> 00:55:30.772]  I mean, how weird is that in plain view?
[00:55:31.012 --> 00:55:33.953]  We're going to inject your kids with a virus that attacks their brain.
[00:55:35.114 --> 00:55:36.615]  It isn't a joke, people!
[00:55:38.776 --> 00:55:45.399]  I think they get away with some of these things, because there are the public who are always looking at some new news story, so it will stay in their minds for two or three weeks, and then there'll be something you need to worry about.
[00:55:45.459 --> 00:55:46.820]  In our government, there's so many things.
[00:55:48.308 --> 00:55:54.431]  I wanted to mention something about a news story from the Telegraph today, which says, Argentina renews campaign over Fulton's campaign.
[00:55:54.471 --> 00:56:00.953]  Now, around Fulton Islands, there's an awful lot of oil, and I wondered if there was any New World Order agenda with that one.
[00:56:02.774 --> 00:56:06.415]  Well, and, you know, blew up that huge battleship with a submarine.
[00:56:06.455 --> 00:56:08.856]  I mean, I don't, I mean, what do you think?
[00:56:09.016 --> 00:56:12.618]  I mean, are they talking about some new military campaign there?
[00:56:13.413 --> 00:56:14.134]  I really don't know.
[00:56:14.194 --> 00:56:20.839]  It's just that this year we lose our aircraft carriers, and I said to myself a couple of years ago, and then now I said, this is when they're going to do it.
[00:56:20.859 --> 00:56:22.501]  2006, we lose our aircraft carriers.
[00:56:22.521 --> 00:56:24.662]  Why are you guys getting rid of your aircraft carriers?
[00:56:25.743 --> 00:56:26.684]  We've got a Labour government.
[00:56:27.765 --> 00:56:30.107]  Yeah.
[00:56:30.167 --> 00:56:31.208]  They're a complete joke here.
[00:56:31.228 --> 00:56:36.432]  You think Bush is bad, well, Blair's worse in some respects.
[00:56:36.833 --> 00:56:39.475]  I wanted to say something about getting the message out as well.
[00:56:39.495 --> 00:56:40.356]  There's so many things to say.
[00:56:40.376 --> 00:56:41.857]  I don't want to take up all the time, though.
[00:56:43.016 --> 00:56:47.958]  In our country, one of the most effective marketing methods today is text messaging on cell phones.
[00:56:48.839 --> 00:56:51.460]  Because people look at text messages from when they do an email.
[00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:57.922]  And all they need to do is put 9-11 was an inside job and put your www.prisonplanet.tv and it will help.
[00:56:58.342 --> 00:57:04.985]  The other thing that I've found is useful is to put on your email signature, 9-11 was an inside job, then the URL prisonplanet.tv.
[00:57:07.739 --> 00:57:11.763]  Well, you guys must be doing something right, because we just get more and more traffic, more and more visitors.
[00:57:11.783 --> 00:57:13.184]  We're waking more and more people up.
[00:57:13.224 --> 00:57:31.882]  It's kind of scary to be in the spotlight this much, but this is the path we chose, and I want to thank all of you for... And as far as Perston's concerned, I mean, I saw that Monday, and I went down to see the people down at the fruit store in Stockwell, because I don't live too far away, and they said that of all the interviews that they had, that yours was the one they enjoyed the most.
[00:57:32.998 --> 00:57:35.940]  And I'm going to burn off a copy for them as soon as I've got a chance to do it.
[00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:36.620]  Wait a minute.
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:39.142]  You're talking about the fruit store where I go down there?
[00:57:39.202 --> 00:57:44.985]  The fruit store that you were at where the young woman that you were interviewing, you got her take on events.
[00:57:45.065 --> 00:57:46.426]  Why are you going to give it to her?
[00:57:46.446 --> 00:57:47.527]  She's just going to get mad.
[00:57:48.567 --> 00:57:53.230]  Actually, well, she didn't seem to be.
[00:57:53.330 --> 00:57:55.031]  So she remembered us doing the interview?
[00:57:55.332 --> 00:57:58.554]  She remembered you doing it, yeah.
[00:57:58.574 --> 00:57:59.754]  You're going to give her a copy.
[00:58:00.235 --> 00:58:00.495]  Oh, boy.
[00:58:00.515 --> 00:58:00.875]  Why not?
[00:58:01.425 --> 00:58:05.987]  I gave one to the teller today at the bank after I wrote a comment in the book saying 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:58:08.008 --> 00:58:10.309]  Well, that'll be interesting when she sees it.
[00:58:12.651 --> 00:58:13.871]  Give up liberty for freedom.
[00:58:14.772 --> 00:58:16.452]  One last thing I wanted to say, Alex.
[00:58:17.253 --> 00:58:22.876]  Since I put a link on our forum, I belong to a club in the UK and we have a forum, and I put the link to Terror Storm up there.
[00:58:23.696 --> 00:58:29.439]  One of our new friends in this group is a 20-year veteran of the American Army
[00:58:29.986 --> 00:58:34.709]  He's in complete denial, and he was very offended by me putting the link up on our show.
[00:58:34.729 --> 00:58:35.070]  Stay there.
[00:58:35.090 --> 00:58:36.150]  I'll let you finish up in a minute.
[00:58:39.052 --> 00:58:43.315]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:55.070 --> 00:58:55.710]  Big Brother.
[00:58:56.371 --> 00:58:57.452]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:58.152 --> 00:58:59.273]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:59.914 --> 00:59:00.734]  You want answers?
[00:59:01.475 --> 00:59:02.376]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:03.056 --> 00:59:06.699]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:11.323]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:22.446 --> 00:59:25.309]  Monday through Friday, 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[00:59:25.329 --> 00:59:27.811]  I know I haven't gone to a lot of calls, but we will later today.
[00:59:28.772 --> 00:59:32.375]  Will Tham's the caller in England, finishing up what he was saying.
[00:59:32.435 --> 00:59:33.095]  Paul, go ahead.
[00:59:33.135 --> 00:59:33.856]  You're on a forum.
[00:59:33.896 --> 00:59:34.937]  This guy from the U.S.
[00:59:35.317 --> 00:59:37.279]  has trouble believing 9-11's an inside job.
[00:59:37.299 --> 00:59:38.620]  Go ahead.
[00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:42.443]  2001, and I explained to him the information that I've got.
[00:59:42.483 --> 00:59:47.807]  I sent him a couple of very lengthy emails explaining, you know, for instance, reign of the government, etc., etc., how can you dispute this?
[00:59:48.528 --> 00:59:49.649]  And he went in complete denial.
[00:59:50.414 --> 00:59:54.416]  But as a border patrolman, I just wondered if you'd like to offer some comments just to remind him.
[00:59:54.436 --> 00:59:57.217]  He's not listening, but I'd like him to listen to this on the recording.
[00:59:57.237 --> 00:59:58.118]  Well, I can't help him.
[00:59:59.979 --> 01:00:01.179]  Sure, I mean, I can't help him.
[01:00:01.399 --> 01:00:02.660]  If he doesn't want to know the truth, fine.
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:05.822]  This stuff is true, and he knows it in his gut, and so he's in denial.
[01:00:06.122 --> 01:00:06.642]  I've got to go.
[01:00:06.682 --> 01:00:07.562]  I appreciate the call.
[01:00:08.483 --> 01:00:11.004]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brian in Georgia.
[01:00:11.044 --> 01:00:11.805]  Brian, go ahead.
[01:00:11.825 --> 01:00:13.505]  Hi, Alex.
[01:00:14.006 --> 01:00:14.306]  Hello.
[01:00:14.326 --> 01:00:18.768]  Hey, I just want your listeners to know if they don't believe you about these vaccinations...
[01:00:19.656 --> 01:00:30.039]  To get the book by Dr. Eisenstein that's available on Infowars.com, Don't Vaccinate Before You Educate, it pretty much lays out everything you said as the truth.
[01:00:31.519 --> 01:00:45.503]  Also, Alex, I'd like to thank you and Charlie Sheen and Jack Blood for being out there on the front line and getting thrown against the barbed wire, like you said, for all of us to learn the truth.
[01:00:48.524 --> 01:00:50.306]  Well, listen, I'm just doing my job.
[01:00:50.366 --> 01:00:55.971]  I see a threat to my family and my country, and I'm going to fight it, and I'm just glad you're standing shoulder to shoulder with us, my friend.
[01:00:58.013 --> 01:01:13.967]  Alex, I was listening to Jack Blood the other day, and he said that David Icke was having some problems, and I know that David Icke's kind of controversial and everything, but his research on the New World Order is really important.
[01:01:14.847 --> 01:01:18.630]  And I was wondering if you could tell your listeners a little bit about what's going on with him.
[01:01:19.731 --> 01:01:20.171]  I don't know.
[01:01:20.251 --> 01:01:22.473]  I need to check into that, and I appreciate your call.
[01:01:22.773 --> 01:01:28.377]  I mean, I think he's having some intramural squabble with some people he works with.
[01:01:28.437 --> 01:01:30.799]  I really can't... That's what I know.
[01:01:30.839 --> 01:01:31.560]  I need to call David.
[01:01:32.741 --> 01:01:34.462]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Texas.
[01:01:34.482 --> 01:01:35.222]  John, go ahead.
[01:01:35.242 --> 01:01:36.263]  Hi, Alex.
[01:01:36.784 --> 01:01:36.984]  Hi.
[01:01:37.004 --> 01:01:39.225]  A couple weeks ago, I was reading U.S.
[01:01:39.265 --> 01:01:41.427]  News & World Report, and it said in the U.S.
[01:01:41.447 --> 01:01:42.428]  News & World Report that...
[01:01:43.072 --> 01:01:47.416]  Bush was borrowing $2 billion a day from Red China to keep his economy afloat.
[01:01:49.177 --> 01:01:58.925]  And I took that to work and showed people, and I said, look, look what this good conservative, he's taking it so far in depth to a murderous communist regime that we ain't ever going to get out.
[01:02:00.587 --> 01:02:01.568]  There's more than enough stuff.
[01:02:01.648 --> 01:02:10.035]  If you just pay attention to the mainstream media, and you can glean stuff, just that alone ought to be enough to get people marching on the road to Washington.
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:21.502]  I came home yesterday and I turned on the news and they said what you were talking about a few days ago, that thousands of people are losing their homes now because of a rise in interest rates.
[01:02:23.962 --> 01:02:35.092]  They get everybody hooked into debt, double, triple mortgages, and they pull the rug out from under you while the media tells you how great the economy is because the stock market's at $11,000, but the dollar's been devalued by over 40%.
[01:02:35.152 --> 01:02:37.854]  The stock market's really at about $6,500.
[01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:41.758]  It's all smoke and mirrors, and the debt itself is smoke and mirrors.
[01:02:41.778 --> 01:02:44.240]  It was all created out of fiat by the central banks.
[01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:46.061]  We don't even owe any of it.
[01:02:46.161 --> 01:02:47.423]  It's all a huge scam.
[01:02:47.963 --> 01:02:48.924]  I appreciate your call.
[01:02:50.434 --> 01:02:54.918]  When we get back from break, we are scheduled to have Colonel Ronald D. Ray, U.S.
[01:02:54.938 --> 01:02:55.999]  Marine Corps, retired.
[01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:59.082]  He's the lawyer that defended Michael New.
[01:02:59.362 --> 01:03:04.667]  He was also Admiral Moore's former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's lawyer for 10 years.
[01:03:04.887 --> 01:03:06.708]  The late Admiral Moore died two years ago.
[01:03:06.929 --> 01:03:07.549]  Great American.
[01:03:09.211 --> 01:03:11.452]  Very honored that I've had a chance to interview him three or four times.
[01:03:11.472 --> 01:03:15.816]  We'll also talk about the destruction of our military under U.N.
[01:03:15.856 --> 01:03:17.578]  New World Order control.
[01:03:19.362 --> 01:03:22.423]  With the colonel on the other side of this quick break.
[01:03:22.443 --> 01:03:25.784]  And we've got Bob Dacey joining us, who writes for the New American Magazine.
[01:03:26.204 --> 01:03:30.485]  He's written an article exclusive to InfoWars.com about the NAFTA superhighways.
[01:03:30.885 --> 01:03:38.167]  And so we will get that up and cover the American Union when we get into the third hour as well.
[01:03:39.607 --> 01:03:45.969]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic, exposing the entire globalist agenda that is now in its final phases.
[01:03:46.866 --> 01:03:48.627]  Hub Police saving this republic.
[01:03:48.647 --> 01:03:49.228]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:50.729 --> 01:03:52.230]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:55.512]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:55.652 --> 01:03:59.555]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:03:59.595 --> 01:04:03.818]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State to the Takeover.
[01:04:04.178 --> 01:04:07.940]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:08.041 --> 01:04:09.922]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:10.482 --> 01:04:13.343]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[01:04:13.423 --> 01:04:18.165]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:18.305 --> 01:04:21.347]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:21.527 --> 01:04:24.388]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:24.868 --> 01:04:30.991]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:31.511 --> 01:04:32.032]  We're good to go.
[01:04:50.169 --> 01:04:53.432]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:04:53.512 --> 01:04:57.675]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:04:57.936 --> 01:05:00.718]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:05:00.918 --> 01:05:03.300]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:12.147]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:05:12.347 --> 01:05:13.708]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:05:13.889 --> 01:05:18.012]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:05:18.452 --> 01:05:32.282]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[01:05:32.482 --> 01:05:39.047]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[01:05:39.227 --> 01:05:42.129]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:47.153 --> 01:05:48.815]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:49.876 --> 01:05:52.760]  So Janice, where are you and Jim going on vacation this summer?
[01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:54.341]  Definitely somewhere with a beach.
[01:05:54.382 --> 01:05:56.824]  Though who knows if our feet will even touch the sand.
[01:05:57.045 --> 01:06:00.769]  That reminds me Janice, have you figured out how to talk to Jim about his problem?
[01:06:00.889 --> 01:06:03.792]  No, I want to, but men can be so sensitive.
[01:06:03.973 --> 01:06:05.074]  Well, it's only going to get worse.
[01:06:05.094 --> 01:06:05.234]  I think.
[01:06:21.824 --> 01:06:27.285]  You can get Mycoside NS antifungal treatment in the food care aisle at any drugstore or major retailer.
[01:06:27.405 --> 01:06:28.485]  And it really worked?
[01:06:28.705 --> 01:06:30.146]  Yep, it worked on me, too.
[01:06:30.326 --> 01:06:32.386]  I had some white discolorations on my toe.
[01:06:32.506 --> 01:06:34.546]  I just applied Mycoside NS daily.
[01:06:34.666 --> 01:06:36.467]  I didn't even have to remove my nail polish.
[01:06:36.747 --> 01:06:37.447]  Sounds easy.
[01:06:37.587 --> 01:06:39.407]  I can start planning our beach getaway.
[01:06:39.627 --> 01:06:43.868]  Yeah, Mycoside definitely gave us the confidence to bare our feet again.
[01:06:44.108 --> 01:06:47.069]  Pick up Mycoside NS at drugstores and major retailers.
[01:06:47.169 --> 01:06:49.009]  Look for a free bonus gift in each box.
[01:06:50.419 --> 01:06:58.143]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:06:59.944 --> 01:07:01.805]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:07:01.845 --> 01:07:02.605]  until 2 p.m.
[01:07:02.645 --> 01:07:18.093]  Central Standard Time, we're here live, blasting out on the AM and FM dial from Southern California to Illinois, from Texas to Florida, simulcasting on the Internet at Infowars.com and JonesReport.com and Global Shortwave WWCR as well.
[01:07:19.645 --> 01:07:23.853]  We're very honored to be joined by Colonel Ronald D. Ray, U.S.
[01:07:23.893 --> 01:07:24.976]  Marine Corps, retired.
[01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:34.403]  And Colonel Ray is a practicing attorney in Kentucky and a highly decorated combat veteran of the Vietnam War.
[01:07:34.463 --> 01:07:36.544]  Two silver stars and a bronze star and a purple heart.
[01:07:36.844 --> 01:07:50.710]  He served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense during the Reagan administration and was appointed by President Bush to serve on the American Battle Monuments Commission from 1994 and on 92 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces from 90 through 94.
[01:07:50.770 --> 01:07:54.552]  He served as a military historian and Deputy Director of Field Operations for the U.S.
[01:07:54.572 --> 01:07:56.173]  Marine Corps Historical Center.
[01:07:56.733 --> 01:08:19.408]  Washington, D.C., Colonel Ray, selected for Who's Who in America and American Law, writes and speaks on a wide range of national security, historical and constitutional issues, and has appeared on a variety of national television news broadcasts from ABC World News Tonight, Larry King Live, Hannity & Combs, Fox & Friends, The Today Show, Crossfire, and a number of other national radio broadcasts.
[01:08:19.908 --> 01:08:23.571]  And, of course, he is the lawyer who valiantly and brilliantly defended
[01:08:24.915 --> 01:08:28.258]  Michael New, and I've, of course, seen him in the documentary made about that.
[01:08:28.958 --> 01:08:38.745]  He, of course, was the lawyer for former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Thomas Moore, who was a great hero of this country and a frequent guest in years past.
[01:08:38.785 --> 01:08:40.727]  The now late Moore died two years ago.
[01:08:41.525 --> 01:08:45.568]  And he is a friend of Major General Black that we had on a few weeks ago.
[01:08:45.588 --> 01:08:54.015]  His main focus, of course, has been the destruction of our military, exposing that, and exposing the U.N., the New World Order, takeover operations.
[01:08:54.315 --> 01:08:58.158]  And we are honored to have Colonel Ronald D. Ray with us today.
[01:08:58.238 --> 01:08:59.379]  Colonel, thank you for joining us.
[01:08:59.619 --> 01:09:00.559]  Alex, the honor is mine.
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:01.520]  Good to be on your show.
[01:09:02.041 --> 01:09:07.024]  Boy, you've had a terrific group of guests that have gone on before.
[01:09:07.124 --> 01:09:09.066]  It's this company I'm so proud to be a part of.
[01:09:09.625 --> 01:09:10.745]  Well, thank you for joining us.
[01:09:10.785 --> 01:09:16.727]  You know, in college they told us that the New World Order was good, that America was going to be merged into an American Union.
[01:09:17.127 --> 01:09:20.208]  Then I'd turn on CNN and they said, Kooks talked about it, it didn't exist.
[01:09:20.508 --> 01:09:22.909]  Now Lou Dobbs admits we're going into an American Union.
[01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:26.270]  Now mainstream publications admit we're going into a New World Order.
[01:09:26.610 --> 01:09:27.950]  Our borders are being erased.
[01:09:28.030 --> 01:09:30.631]  Women are being put in front-line positions.
[01:09:30.991 --> 01:09:33.192]  Our troops are going under UN control.
[01:09:34.572 --> 01:09:44.260]  First off, tell us a little bit about yourself, your awakening to this global system, and then get into what you think is the most important facts concerning this, and then how we defeated, how we saved this country.
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:10:01.673]  Well, that's a really interesting question, because I was commissioned in 1964 in the Marine Corps, and that summer I was a Goldwater Republican, and that summer I heard Ronald Reagan's speech in there, and I became a Goldwater Reagan kind of supporter, served my five years active duty.
[01:10:01.773 --> 01:10:04.035]  I was at Way City during the Tet Offensive.
[01:10:04.574 --> 01:10:11.956]  The first breach for me came when Walter Cronkite came, where we were fighting and the temperatures got down into the 40s up there.
[01:10:11.976 --> 01:10:13.617]  There was still some monsoon up there.
[01:10:13.637 --> 01:10:16.298]  We didn't have the air we needed in Way City.
[01:10:16.578 --> 01:10:17.938]  I was with the Vietnamese Marines.
[01:10:18.038 --> 01:10:18.258]  U.S.
[01:10:18.278 --> 01:10:26.521]  Marines took half of the city, the southern half of the city, and it was the pivotal point of the Vietnam War essentially focused on this.
[01:10:26.581 --> 01:10:31.603]  And Walter Cronkite, the most trusted man in America, came up in 08, 09, 10 February at some point,
[01:10:33.701 --> 01:10:42.685]  Safely south of the Perfume River, he told the world that that offensive was a great strategic setback for the United States.
[01:10:42.705 --> 01:10:45.127]  It was a victory for the North Vietnamese.
[01:10:45.187 --> 01:10:51.069]  It proved there was no light at the end of the tunnel, and the best that the Americans could hope to do was to begin to negotiate.
[01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:53.751]  There was no possibility of victory.
[01:10:53.931 --> 01:10:58.233]  When you had actually repulsed 90% of the attack, is that accurate?
[01:10:58.533 --> 01:11:00.575]  No question.
[01:11:00.615 --> 01:11:01.656]  Anybody can attack you.
[01:11:01.696 --> 01:11:05.259]  A smaller force can attack a larger force and doesn't mean they won't be wiped out.
[01:11:05.279 --> 01:11:11.324]  The VC, the Viet Cong, were never an effective fighting force again after the Tet Offensive.
[01:11:11.345 --> 01:11:15.348]  They identified themselves, gave us a chance to wipe them out.
[01:11:15.448 --> 01:11:19.272]  After Tet, it was really North Vietnamese main force units against U.S.
[01:11:19.352 --> 01:11:20.793]  units and some of the better
[01:11:21.365 --> 01:11:21.965]  We're good to go.
[01:11:43.687 --> 01:11:44.628]  We're pretty horrific.
[01:11:44.728 --> 01:11:48.890]  Is Full Metal Jacket's portrayal of that city battle, is that accurate?
[01:11:49.251 --> 01:11:50.812]  Well, yeah, a little bit.
[01:11:50.952 --> 01:11:52.413]  I mean, a little bit, I think.
[01:11:52.513 --> 01:11:57.096]  You just don't get the flavor of it was cold and there was a lot of rain and it lasted 30 days.
[01:11:58.751 --> 01:12:00.453]  So, you know, it was maybe more.
[01:12:00.913 --> 01:12:01.734]  It was really tough.
[01:12:01.934 --> 01:12:02.034]  U.S.
[01:12:02.074 --> 01:12:03.175]  Marines did a great job.
[01:12:03.215 --> 01:12:06.317]  The Vietnamese Marines held their own in there and did a good job.
[01:12:06.377 --> 01:12:07.358]  And that was another thing.
[01:12:07.398 --> 01:12:11.380]  They were always reporting that the Vietnamese didn't care, didn't want to fight, and it wasn't their country.
[01:12:11.421 --> 01:12:15.584]  And I spent a year fighting with those guys, and I never lost a night's sleep.
[01:12:15.844 --> 01:12:17.245]  They were really wonderful soldiers.
[01:12:17.265 --> 01:12:19.666]  The point was Cronkite told a huge lie.
[01:12:20.247 --> 01:12:23.709]  It was picked up by the media monopoly back here in this country and repeated.
[01:12:24.350 --> 01:12:26.111]  And I came home on the 21st of March, 1968,
[01:12:27.893 --> 01:12:34.597]  And within ten days, my commander-in-chief, you know, Lyndon Johnson, you know, essentially said he wasn't going to run for re-election.
[01:12:34.697 --> 01:12:42.361]  And I knew there was a connection between the lie that had been told at Way City where I could see the truth for myself.
[01:12:42.441 --> 01:12:45.283]  And I knew there was a connection between that and Johnson stepping down.
[01:12:45.943 --> 01:12:51.787]  And eventually I got a tour behind me and went to recruiting duty and knew there was something wrong and the problem was here.
[01:12:52.027 --> 01:12:54.488]  And to boil it down, there were backroom deals going on.
[01:12:54.548 --> 01:12:55.969]  Our government didn't want to win that war.
[01:12:56.596 --> 01:12:58.377]  Well, that became apparent to me later.
[01:12:58.437 --> 01:12:59.237]  I mean, think about it.
[01:12:59.257 --> 01:13:01.198]  It's a country the size of the state of Mississippi.
[01:13:01.238 --> 01:13:10.943]  How many people could you handicap the outcome of whether the United States against a country the size of the state of Mississippi would take 21 years, 58,000 killed, and we come out on the wrong end of that?
[01:13:10.963 --> 01:13:13.704]  It takes a lot of work to make that kind of outcome occur.
[01:13:14.364 --> 01:13:21.488]  But I went to law school with the idea of getting involved in politics, and the very second of my class in law school didn't learn anything about the Constitution or the Bill of Rights.
[01:13:21.528 --> 01:13:24.149]  That only came later, but I learned legal process.
[01:13:24.932 --> 01:13:35.958]  Got involved in the Reagan's effort against Ford in 76, and then when he was elected in 80, he brought a lot of Marines, and a lot of guys like me got chances to serve in the Reagan administration.
[01:13:35.978 --> 01:13:49.845]  So I got to see government up close, worked for Cap Weinberger, and then I worked for George Herbert Walker Bush, and it was while I was serving on the Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Military that it all came home to me.
[01:13:50.726 --> 01:13:53.347]  We're in Los Angeles, and your backyard out there
[01:13:54.022 --> 01:13:56.504]  And David Horowitz was a witness.
[01:13:57.324 --> 01:13:58.725]  And there were 15 commissioners.
[01:13:59.665 --> 01:14:06.309]  Dick Cheney had appointed, recommended 15 commissioners, and 14 of the 15 were already in favor of women in combat.
[01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:15.015]  The Bush White House kicked five of the worst off and put five folks that knew that there was a profound difference between men and women on that commission.
[01:14:15.375 --> 01:14:18.597]  So here we were, $4 million of taxpayers' money to see if there's a
[01:14:19.181 --> 01:14:19.601]  We're good to go.
[01:14:48.055 --> 01:14:52.698]  The former Vice Chief of Staff of the Army who led the operation in Panama.
[01:14:53.058 --> 01:14:56.441]  And he hadn't decided which way he was going to go.
[01:14:56.761 --> 01:15:06.968]  And David Horowitz, a supposed conservative, who supposedly had a political conversion after the Black Panthers murdered a friend of his in cold blood and supported Reagan.
[01:15:08.152 --> 01:15:21.801]  And he basically, some of his testimony, and he and I were together at Quantico the next year during the thing about homosexuality and the armed forces under Clinton, but this is what he said in essence between those two testimonies.
[01:15:21.841 --> 01:15:26.404]  He said, I was raised as a Bolshevik dedicated to the subversion and overthrow of this country.
[01:15:27.305 --> 01:15:30.847]  We captured all your institutions by the late 60s except the armed forces.
[01:15:32.239 --> 01:15:37.262]  And we realized this protracted war wasn't doing the job on the military we hoped.
[01:15:37.343 --> 01:15:46.529]  We in council and meetings, we planned and determined that the best way to finish the job on the military was to promote the notion of women in combat and homosexuality in the armed forces.
[01:15:48.050 --> 01:15:57.116]  Now I'm sitting there, you know, as a Vietnam combat veteran, I'm realizing, I'm looking at one of the guys who was really doing the job on us while I was 9,000 miles away fighting the wrong enemy.
[01:15:58.036 --> 01:16:00.418]  And I thought about what he said and
[01:16:01.008 --> 01:16:07.834]  By the way, I came up and introduced myself to him and asked, I said, David, you said you had all of our institutions except the military.
[01:16:07.874 --> 01:16:09.775]  Tell me about the seminaries and the churches.
[01:16:10.616 --> 01:16:16.620]  And he gave this wolfish kind of smile and let me know that maybe nothing had really changed because he said, you know, we got them first.
[01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:17.401]  They were the easiest.
[01:16:18.802 --> 01:16:23.626]  And I think from that moment on, I became an engaged activist.
[01:16:23.886 --> 01:16:24.687]  Let's put it that way.
[01:16:24.847 --> 01:16:29.751]  I realized that the problem was the enemy from within.
[01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:31.900]  Not the enemy from without.
[01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:40.002]  And I started being a real active... to try to learn what I didn't know about my country's history.
[01:16:40.322 --> 01:16:42.503]  And I began as being a student of history.
[01:16:42.543 --> 01:16:45.303]  And then I got a call from folks who used to work with Jesse Helms.
[01:16:46.303 --> 01:16:48.544]  And they'd seen me on Larry King Live.
[01:16:48.584 --> 01:16:53.605]  That same month I was on Larry King Live debating the issue of homosexuality in the armed forces with...
[01:16:54.505 --> 01:17:07.351]  With Larry Korb, CFR, former Assistant Secretary of Defense, when I was in the building and at the Brookings Institute at the time, and a backseat driver in his uniform who claimed that he was homosexual.
[01:17:07.391 --> 01:17:17.636]  So I had that debate, and I got a call, and these guys said, you won't believe what's going on in the Senate Select Committee on POWMI Affairs, chaired by John Kerry.
[01:17:18.573 --> 01:17:22.915]  And I said, would you be willing to look at the evidence that's being kept out of those hearings?
[01:17:22.995 --> 01:17:23.735]  And I said I would.
[01:17:23.775 --> 01:17:29.258]  These were serious men, Vietnam veterans, former CIA officials, guys that had worked in the Senate for years.
[01:17:29.958 --> 01:17:34.940]  They took me through the evidence of the fact that it was overwhelming that we left over 700 men, abandoned over 700 men.
[01:17:38.545 --> 01:17:59.780]  Behind, at the end of that commission hearing, I determined not to go back to my normal law practice, but I wrote the first book, Military Necessity and Homosexuality, about all the reasons why sodomy, among other immoral and dissolute behaviors, were always against the law, were always criminal in the United States military, going all the way back to 1775.
[01:18:01.261 --> 01:18:07.425]  And I began to realize that it was worth, that the principles undergirding the American military were still in place.
[01:18:08.246 --> 01:18:24.013]  Well, when we get back, Colonel, I want to fast forward to what happened with Michael New, to the globalists, to the American Union, to the people that are in control of our government now, what's happening, their overall overarching plan, and then hopefully ways to turn this around.
[01:18:24.413 --> 01:18:28.055]  We'll be back after a quick break with Colonel Ronald D. Ray, U.S.
[01:18:28.095 --> 01:18:29.515]  Marine Corps, retired.
[01:18:29.535 --> 01:18:35.298]  We've got a lot of questions for him, a lot of key points that are going to be coming up, so you'll all want to stay with us.
[01:18:36.144 --> 01:18:40.007]  And we may even have time to take a little bit of calls here at the end of this hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:18:40.807 --> 01:18:43.829]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:18:44.229 --> 01:18:47.832]  Websites are jonesreport.com and infowars.net.
[01:18:47.892 --> 01:18:48.352]  Check them out.
[01:18:51.174 --> 01:18:53.475]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:53.996 --> 01:18:56.837]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[01:18:57.778 --> 01:19:04.002]  The best kept secret in the world today is that now it is possible to kill cancer without personal suffering.

[01:21:04.230 --> 01:21:08.896]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.

[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:28.247]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[01:23:07.359 --> 01:23:13.662]  Colonel Ray... Getting down to brass tacks, we know it's bigger than just the communists.
[01:23:13.682 --> 01:23:16.824]  We know that that's a larger... There's a larger program.
[01:23:16.844 --> 01:23:22.006]  We know that the big banks, the elite of the world, want to consolidate power.
[01:23:22.046 --> 01:23:23.467]  They want to consolidate control.
[01:23:23.507 --> 01:23:24.668]  They'll use any mechanisms.
[01:23:24.708 --> 01:23:27.009]  Carol Quigley at Georgetown, Bill Clinton's...
[01:23:27.999 --> 01:23:43.456]  Political science professor openly wrote in Tragedy and Hope, the American Union, the NAFTA highways, the amnesty programs, Bush signing on to UNESCO and the UN, administration after administration, especially since George Bush Sr.
[01:23:43.476 --> 01:23:44.076]  and then Clinton.
[01:23:44.497 --> 01:23:45.698]  This is just ongoing.
[01:23:46.018 --> 01:23:46.919]  Who are we facing?
[01:23:46.999 --> 01:23:49.522]  Who is trying to set up this one world government?
[01:23:51.997 --> 01:23:53.779]  Well, you know, it's interesting.
[01:23:53.799 --> 01:23:59.364]  You're asking me now to give you some insight on that from my perspective?
[01:23:59.445 --> 01:23:59.725]  Yes, sir.
[01:23:59.765 --> 01:24:00.786]  Let's jump right into it.
[01:24:01.126 --> 01:24:01.447]  Okay.
[01:24:01.467 --> 01:24:04.229]  Let me say where we have to start.
[01:24:04.289 --> 01:24:07.373]  What's the most important ground for us to retake first?
[01:24:07.433 --> 01:24:10.636]  And this is where you come in and the great job you play.
[01:24:11.714 --> 01:24:29.145]  Daniel Boorstin, when he was coming up to be librarian of the Library of Congress, and most Americans don't even know who the librarian of the Library of Congress is or that he's the most important historian in the world at any particular one time, because he's the guy who's supposed to answer the questions historically and give the lawmakers what they need.
[01:24:29.725 --> 01:24:36.870]  He said in 1961 that we live in a world, Americans live in a world of pseudo-facts, which is created for them by their own media.
[01:24:37.731 --> 01:24:46.816]  So that what we need to do is get a hold on, like, even people like David McCullough, skull and bones from Yale, but a pretty good historian, a readable historian, gave the keynote address in 2002.
[01:24:47.116 --> 01:24:53.299]  He said, we've raised a generation of historical illiterates, which is dangerous to American liberty.
[01:24:53.799 --> 01:24:57.641]  We face a foe today who believes in enforced ignorance.
[01:24:58.222 --> 01:24:58.702]  We don't.
[01:24:58.802 --> 01:25:02.684]  And he got a standing ovation from a largely elite liberal,
[01:25:03.223 --> 01:25:08.504]  What would be called liberal urban crowd that gathered there for the National Book Fair in October of 2002.
[01:25:09.225 --> 01:25:10.345]  Got a standing ovation.
[01:25:11.025 --> 01:25:15.106]  But I saw it live on C-SPAN and I stood up and I thought it was a great thing.
[01:25:15.126 --> 01:25:22.108]  So here's something that across the spectrum people can agree on that we face a foe today.
[01:25:22.128 --> 01:25:26.509]  In 2002 he wasn't talking about Islamic radicals.
[01:25:26.929 --> 01:25:32.511]  He was talking about the people that would constitute the ACLU and the NEA and their funders
[01:25:33.072 --> 01:25:33.572]  We're good to go.
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:26:04.565]  That how important it is to participate in public affairs, to understand that most of the things you hold and believe are pseudo-facts.
[01:26:05.045 --> 01:26:10.868]  I mean, to come to that place where you realize that you need to learn what's really going on, which means you need to know the past.
[01:26:12.589 --> 01:26:21.674]  The grandson of Benjamin Franklin, Benjamin Franklin Bache, was thrown in jail during the alien and sedition business, standing up for
[01:26:22.426 --> 01:26:28.211]  The way you stand up, you'll probably wonder sometime when they're going to come knock on your door for saying the things that you say.
[01:26:28.251 --> 01:26:29.112]  But here's what he said.
[01:26:29.692 --> 01:26:41.782]  And every one of your listeners should take this to heart this weekend when they think about what the Declaration of Independence, which was a stand based on the laws of nature and of nature's God, against tyranny, against an occupation.
[01:26:42.202 --> 01:26:48.728]  Liberty will never be safe or durable in a republic until every citizen thinks it is much his duty to take care of the state
[01:26:49.466 --> 01:26:58.589]  As to take care of his family, and until an indifference to any public question shall be considered as a public offense.
[01:26:58.689 --> 01:27:03.150]  And that was 1792 when he made that declaration, and he'd already gone to jail.
[01:27:04.670 --> 01:27:06.371]  I think that's where we start.
[01:27:07.271 --> 01:27:16.734]  I've got to be able to take over the things that I'm responsible for, and I've got to be engaged and involved, and that means I need to know that I'm not acting on, Sultan Ethan said it,
[01:27:17.591 --> 01:27:24.097]  The last essay he gave before he left the Soviet Union was forced out and came to exile in the United States of America.
[01:27:24.117 --> 01:27:26.700]  He wrote an essay called Live Not by Lies.
[01:27:27.701 --> 01:27:32.585]  And his point was you have to know the truth and you can't live by a lie.
[01:27:32.785 --> 01:27:42.895]  And he makes the point in there that every lie is capable of being exposed and will eventually be exposed by brave men willing to stand up and declare the truth.
[01:27:43.413 --> 01:27:53.200]  He said the partner of the lie has to be violence, because that's the only way you can force people who know the truth to live a lie or to be silent in the face of a lie.
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:55.981]  So I think those are important principles.
[01:27:56.021 --> 01:28:00.104]  Well, here's a lie, Colonel, and we're about to break, come back with a long segment, plenty of time to talk.
[01:28:00.424 --> 01:28:01.105]  Here's a lie.
[01:28:02.009 --> 01:28:06.973]  We're told that George Bush is a conservative when he spent more money than all presidents before him combined.
[01:28:07.374 --> 01:28:08.955]  He's setting up the American Union.
[01:28:08.995 --> 01:28:09.796]  He signed the deal.
[01:28:09.836 --> 01:28:10.356]  Your comment?
[01:28:10.817 --> 01:28:23.528]  Well, I think this neoconservative takeover of the government in the last six years is the destruction of the things that Barry Goldwater would have been running for in 64 and even the things that Ronald Reagan said he supported.
[01:28:24.328 --> 01:28:29.633]  The conservative movement in this country has almost been neutered as a result of this administration.
[01:28:30.706 --> 01:28:31.487]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:28:31.507 --> 01:28:37.632]  And then we've got all these neocon talk show hosts there to really pacify real conservatives while the takeover is completed.
[01:28:37.652 --> 01:28:38.272]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:41.335 --> 01:28:42.235]  We're on the march.
[01:28:42.716 --> 01:28:44.317]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:45.258 --> 01:28:47.940]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:51.229 --> 01:28:51.869]  We're good to go.
[01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:14.080]  We're good to go.

[01:29:51.027 --> 01:29:57.251]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:29:57.411 --> 01:30:03.574]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:30:03.855 --> 01:30:12.280]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:19.544]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:30:19.864 --> 01:30:24.667]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:30:24.887 --> 01:30:30.291]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:30:30.631 --> 01:30:33.713]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:30:34.054 --> 01:30:42.019]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:30:53.147 --> 01:30:53.828]  Hey, Bill.
[01:30:54.168 --> 01:30:55.249]  I'm buying lunch today.
[01:30:55.589 --> 01:30:56.410]  And check this out.
[01:30:56.730 --> 01:30:57.631]  I bought a new car.
[01:30:57.711 --> 01:30:58.352]  Wow, John.
[01:30:58.412 --> 01:31:02.956]  I guess you took my advice and visited that website we were talking about over lunch last time we met.
[01:31:03.517 --> 01:31:07.640]  www.didyourobbillgates.com I did, and you were right.
[01:31:07.981 --> 01:31:12.885]  I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[01:31:13.306 --> 01:31:15.708]  And it's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[01:31:16.048 --> 01:31:19.369]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my fifth week.
[01:31:19.629 --> 01:31:20.529]  Whoa, that's awesome!
[01:31:20.889 --> 01:31:23.270]  John, your business will keep growing as mine has.
[01:31:23.630 --> 01:31:25.891]  In fact, people are joining from all over the world.
[01:31:25.991 --> 01:31:26.671]  It's incredible!
[01:31:27.031 --> 01:31:34.513]  Everyone should go to www.DidYouRobBillGates.com and learn how this program can help them become financially independent, too.
[01:31:34.834 --> 01:31:39.375]  Thanks a million, Bill, for telling me about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:40.367 --> 01:31:41.067]  Check, please.
[01:31:41.528 --> 01:31:42.408]  I got this one, Bill.
[01:31:42.848 --> 01:31:43.489]  Sure, John.
[01:31:43.629 --> 01:31:48.232]  Let's tell everyone about www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[01:31:48.372 --> 01:31:48.692]  Deal.
[01:31:49.052 --> 01:31:55.516]  We don't need no education.
[01:32:00.499 --> 01:32:04.281]  We don't need no thought control.
[01:32:09.216 --> 01:32:10.957]  I've read some of the essays of our guests.
[01:32:11.017 --> 01:32:15.760]  I've seen him interviewed on national television and watched a documentary concerning Michael New that he's in.
[01:32:16.821 --> 01:32:19.502]  We're really honored to have him, and time is running out here on us.
[01:32:19.543 --> 01:32:20.723]  I know we've already got a lot of callers.
[01:32:20.743 --> 01:32:22.264]  I want to specifically talk to him.
[01:32:22.304 --> 01:32:24.886]  We'll do that before this hour ends.
[01:32:24.926 --> 01:32:26.767]  He's Colonel Ronald D. Ray.
[01:32:28.148 --> 01:32:33.031]  We've got links to some of the websites and organizations that he works with up on Infowars.com.
[01:32:34.393 --> 01:32:41.618]  Colonel, I want to get into the UN and how our country's losing its sovereignty and how the CFR openly is pushing for that.
[01:32:42.439 --> 01:32:49.864]  And I don't know how far you want to go on this, but you talk about truth, you talk about how important it is to just put all the marbles or all the chips, all the cards on the table.
[01:32:50.404 --> 01:32:53.667]  My new film, Terror Storm, is about government false flag terror.
[01:32:54.447 --> 01:32:58.110]  And it starts off with Hitler firebombing his own Reichstag, setting up the
[01:32:59.091 --> 01:33:03.615]  The polls with the attack on Glywitz, claiming that the polls had attacked the German radio station.
[01:33:03.995 --> 01:33:05.036]  That's admitted to be staged.
[01:33:05.056 --> 01:33:10.400]  We get into the CIA in 53, overthrowing Mosaddegh by carrying out terror attacks and blaming it on him.
[01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:11.941]  That's at CIA.gov.
[01:33:11.961 --> 01:33:12.661]  You're a historian.
[01:33:12.681 --> 01:33:13.682]  I'm sure you're aware of that.
[01:33:14.483 --> 01:33:18.346]  And then we look at some of the events that have happened in recent times.
[01:33:19.136 --> 01:33:33.468]  And I'm not going to get into what you privately talked about with Kevin, but I would like to hear from you, sir, on your view on the war on terror and the feasibility of supposed al-Qaeda carrying out the attacks of 9-11.
[01:33:34.249 --> 01:33:36.871]  Well, it's a little bit like the point I made about the Vietnam War.
[01:33:37.191 --> 01:33:45.198]  If you sit down, look back, and say, all right, let's war game this in 1955, a country the size of the state of Mississippi,
[01:33:45.859 --> 01:33:47.360]  It's going to take on the United States.
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:48.700]  What's the outcome of that going to be?
[01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:49.820]  How long is it going to last?
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:55.722]  Nobody would handicap 21 years and 58,000 killed and that we'd come out on the short end of the stick.
[01:33:55.762 --> 01:33:56.662]  Nobody would do that.
[01:33:56.703 --> 01:33:58.063]  We weren't even allowed to bomb the North.
[01:33:58.123 --> 01:34:03.405]  Bottom line, invade the North, invade with troop carriers, go up through the middle, take them over from all sides, right?
[01:34:03.665 --> 01:34:05.165]  Well, actually, it's simpler than that.
[01:34:05.365 --> 01:34:11.907]  And Admiral Moore confirmed all this for me when I had the privilege of getting to know him over a period of time from about 1993 until his death.
[01:34:14.452 --> 01:34:24.403]  He wanted and advocated, when he became chief of naval operations, the simple thing here, 85 to 90 percent of the war-making capacity of North Vietnam came through Hai Phong Harbor.
[01:34:25.043 --> 01:34:28.347]  Mining Hai Phong Harbor cuts off their capacity to wage war.
[01:34:29.045 --> 01:34:34.069]  You know, an army fights on its stomach and all the stuff it gets, and you probably know the work of Anthony Sutton.
[01:34:34.109 --> 01:34:40.094]  Anybody out there that's a Vietnam veteran and wants to understand that needs to read Anthony Sutton's The Best Enemy Money Can Buy.
[01:34:40.174 --> 01:34:48.000]  He was a fellow at the Hoover Institute who put together the truth about the technology transfer.
[01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:52.944]  So we know the globalists aid our enemies, build them up, stage these wars.
[01:34:53.264 --> 01:34:54.265]  What about terror, sir?
[01:34:55.185 --> 01:35:02.747]  The first one, and I'm sure you've said this, and I'll say the first comment I made was, we have a half a trillion dollars, roughly, of budget for years.
[01:35:02.807 --> 01:35:06.648]  That's been our whole national security, off-budget, black ops, whole thing.
[01:35:06.948 --> 01:35:09.309]  Half a trillion bucks a year and we can't defend our own Pentagon.
[01:35:09.329 --> 01:35:10.169]  Does that dog hunt?
[01:35:10.629 --> 01:35:11.950]  Not in Kentucky it doesn't hunt.
[01:35:13.630 --> 01:35:14.010]  It doesn't.
[01:35:14.230 --> 01:35:15.371]  It really doesn't.
[01:35:15.431 --> 01:35:20.292]  Half a trillion dollars a year and a bunch of guys in a cave over in Pakistan, Afghanistan somewhere,
[01:35:20.785 --> 01:35:26.809]  We're able to penetrate that half a trillion dollar network that's supposed to provide the Americans with national security.
[01:35:27.470 --> 01:35:30.652]  Well, sir, is that not the greatest conspiracy theory of them all?
[01:35:31.273 --> 01:35:33.895]  Well, here's the next point I would make about that.
[01:35:34.095 --> 01:35:36.937]  And I don't think... I think our side... Let me say this.
[01:35:37.017 --> 01:35:43.962]  People like you and Stan Monteith and people all across the country, you know, the work's been done.
[01:35:43.982 --> 01:35:45.863]  It's all gathered there.
[01:35:46.564 --> 01:35:47.645]  People can get a hold of it.
[01:35:47.685 --> 01:35:49.326]  They can make their understanding clear.
[01:35:49.676 --> 01:35:53.138]  They need to be careful when we go into the court of public opinion.
[01:35:53.218 --> 01:36:02.782]  We can win cases in the mainstream without coming across to the normal American who's still living full of pseudo-facts where we sound extreme.
[01:36:02.843 --> 01:36:03.483]  Let me say this.
[01:36:04.003 --> 01:36:13.868]  If the war on terror was real, then the first thing that would have happened within a matter of weeks after 9-11 would have been that we'd have closed the borders off.
[01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:15.861]  That would have been an absolute outcry.
[01:36:15.881 --> 01:36:21.046]  That would have been the first... Because if you're not a nation, you have no national security if your borders are not secure.
[01:36:21.226 --> 01:36:27.251]  And, Colonel, we know without a shadow of a doubt that the border is less secure now than it was before 2001.
[01:36:27.452 --> 01:36:31.295]  That absolutely seems to be the case.
[01:36:31.415 --> 01:36:36.640]  And I had friends who were in the Pentagon... I'm sorry, in Congress, working with people...
[01:36:37.236 --> 01:36:38.316]  Well, Colonel, what about this?
[01:36:38.336 --> 01:36:39.937]  I mean, importing revolution, importing balkanization.
[01:37:04.325 --> 01:37:07.768]  We know that the government has expanded after 9-11.
[01:37:07.828 --> 01:37:11.890]  We know they've been doing everything they can to dismantle the Bill of Rights, the Constitution.
[01:37:12.411 --> 01:37:15.773]  And then we look at the supposed hijackers trained at U.S.
[01:37:15.813 --> 01:37:17.074]  military bases confirmed.
[01:37:17.114 --> 01:37:22.697]  The dean of the Defense Language School went public, San Jose Mercury News, and said, I was forced to train some of these people.
[01:37:22.737 --> 01:37:31.743]  I interviewed embassy heads who said that they flagged them as terrorists, were ordered by the CIA to let them in because, quote, they were part of a secret government anti-terror program and worked for us.
[01:37:31.823 --> 01:37:32.804]  I know you're aware of that.
[01:37:33.004 --> 01:37:34.325]  You're a very well-informed person.
[01:37:53.143 --> 01:37:58.266]  Sir, Colonel, just getting back to 9-11 here briefly, I mean, put as many cards as you can on the table.
[01:37:58.286 --> 01:38:00.588]  9-11, this event, the official story, is the official story possible?
[01:38:19.437 --> 01:38:21.179]  You know, I tell you, I'm not an expert on 9-11.
[01:38:21.219 --> 01:38:26.164]  You know, I've certainly read Dennis Cuddy's pieces.
[01:38:26.224 --> 01:38:38.816]  Dennis, I think, has done some really wonderful research since he left the Reagan administration when he saw us import the Soviet techniques of indoctrination into the United States there in 1985 when he was in the Department of Education.
[01:38:40.437 --> 01:38:42.960]  You know, so there's obviously... Look...
[01:38:43.773 --> 01:38:44.594]  Let's talk about this.
[01:38:45.194 --> 01:38:46.995]  From my standpoint, things that I do know.
[01:38:47.235 --> 01:38:48.176]  Project Bojenka.
[01:38:48.476 --> 01:39:02.984]  The fact that when the World Trade Center was hit in 1993, the criminal investigation that followed produced one or two computers that were instrumental in the convictions that I think were obtained in 1995.
[01:39:03.684 --> 01:39:11.509]  And the program that was executed in September of 2001 was described on there.
[01:39:11.549 --> 01:39:13.190]  The targets, the methods, the means...
[01:39:13.757 --> 01:39:14.638]  We're all described.
[01:39:14.698 --> 01:39:15.959]  And then Bush said he'd never heard of it.
[01:39:15.979 --> 01:39:17.000]  And then they all stood up.
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:22.024]  All of our leaders stood up, from the Secretary of State, the National Security Advisor.
[01:39:22.664 --> 01:39:40.478]  Others stood up, and you heard them say, and I don't know whether Bush actually said it, I know Condoleezza Rice said, that none of us could have ever imagined that what happened, the hijacking and using the planes as a missile to fly into the Pentagon and the World Trade Center, none of us could have imagined this could have happened.
[01:39:41.299 --> 01:39:42.520]  Since the FBI...
[01:39:44.410 --> 01:39:48.292]  And the security agencies had that information from 95 on.
[01:39:49.052 --> 01:39:56.894]  Just imagine if Hitler had the Overlord operation for six years before we invaded the Normandy beaches.
[01:39:56.934 --> 01:40:00.596]  We'd have never gotten ashore, because he would have had defenses there.
[01:40:00.896 --> 01:40:01.116]  Sure.
[01:40:01.196 --> 01:40:03.757]  Are you aware of Operation Northwoods, Colonel?
[01:40:04.117 --> 01:40:05.937]  I have seen some of those documents.
[01:40:05.977 --> 01:40:10.359]  Dr. Monteith sent me some of those documents that are planned exercise to...
[01:40:12.125 --> 01:40:24.272]  Was it at least a plan to harm Americans, to blame it on a false flag operation, to blame it on the Cubans so that we could justify an action against the Cubans?
[01:40:24.532 --> 01:40:30.556]  From your knowledge in the Pentagon and in the White House, I mean, our government's declassified many false flags they carried out.
[01:40:30.576 --> 01:40:34.458]  I mean, give us your view on false flag ops, and for those who don't know what they are, will you tell us?
[01:40:34.898 --> 01:40:37.720]  Well, let me give you an example of a false flag operation.
[01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:37.840]  The
[01:40:39.503 --> 01:40:50.467]  The attack on the USS Liberty by Israel in June of 1967, I think there were 37 American sailors that were killed, largely unarmed, an unarmed American ship.
[01:40:50.587 --> 01:40:51.788]  An attempt to blame it on Egypt?
[01:40:52.128 --> 01:40:53.588]  And an attempt to blame it on Egypt.
[01:40:53.628 --> 01:40:55.029]  That ship was supposed to be sunk.
[01:40:55.089 --> 01:40:56.269]  It was really a miracle.
[01:40:56.409 --> 01:41:00.431]  And literally, as Admiral Moore said, it was a miracle that that ship didn't sink with a hole.
[01:41:00.731 --> 01:41:03.452]  One of those torpedoes, a dead hit amidships, the hole was...
[01:41:04.139 --> 01:41:04.399]  Exactly.
[01:41:04.419 --> 01:41:09.001]  I interviewed one of the admirals who was on the phone when LBJ came on and said, that GD ship's going to the bottom.
[01:41:09.021 --> 01:41:10.021]  Recall the wings.
[01:41:10.041 --> 01:41:11.002]  Actually, more of what he...
[01:41:26.394 --> 01:41:36.419]  The Sixth Fleet commander, as soon as it was radioed out, that was also a miracle because the first strike on there was to take out the communications capability so they couldn't radio the help.
[01:41:36.499 --> 01:41:40.301]  Even though they took out most of it, an SOS was sent out.
[01:41:40.702 --> 01:41:49.206]  Sixth Fleet automatically launches from the aircraft carrier American strike planes to come to the aid of the Liberty.
[01:41:49.844 --> 01:41:59.735]  And they were recalled, and the Admiral, to his credit, when Robert McNamara, I believe McNamara was still Secretary of Defense there in June of 67, ordered them to return.
[01:41:59.775 --> 01:42:06.943]  The Admiral said that he wouldn't follow the orders of the Secretary of Defense, and Johnson came on the line, as I understand it.
[01:42:06.983 --> 01:42:09.746]  Johnson came on the line and said, Admiral, you recall those...
[01:42:10.721 --> 01:42:16.365]  You call those ships right now, and to which the Admiral said, they're killing our sailors out there.
[01:42:16.405 --> 01:42:19.268]  He said, I don't care how many GD sailors get killed.
[01:42:19.568 --> 01:42:20.969]  I'm not going to embarrass a good ally.
[01:42:21.589 --> 01:42:31.917]  Yeah, well, in fact, I've had one of the admirals on who talked to the Admiral that heard it, and then I had one of the individuals on who actually heard it, and it was, well, I don't want to say the quote again, but yeah, it was even worse than that.
[01:42:32.297 --> 01:42:37.201]  Well, it was to that effect, and, you know, but that's a classic thing.
[01:42:37.714 --> 01:42:43.338]  False flag operation simply means to carry out... In other words, deception is the heart of all warfare.
[01:42:44.099 --> 01:42:57.569]  So the notion is, if I can attack the enemy and leave a flag... That comes from the old idea that you would run up a different flag when you were going to attack somebody at sea... On the ships.
[01:42:57.889 --> 01:43:03.534]  Yeah, on the ships, and you'd have somebody else, and then they would know that if it was unsuccessful, or even if it was...
[01:43:04.170 --> 01:43:11.434]  You know, the British ship was flying a French flag against a Spanish vessel, and the Spanish would think it was the French, not the British who did it.
[01:43:11.494 --> 01:43:12.535]  And it was really the British.
[01:43:12.635 --> 01:43:15.837]  I mean, you're a historian, but I'm sort of a novice on British naval history.
[01:43:15.877 --> 01:43:16.477]  It's so interesting.
[01:43:16.737 --> 01:43:21.900]  The British were really the experts at that, and they would even put on, say, a neutral country's uniforms.
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:23.421]  They'd paint the ship up that way.
[01:43:23.681 --> 01:43:25.242]  They'd be flying its flags, and you're right.
[01:43:25.282 --> 01:43:33.367]  If they weren't successful to board and then get rid of everybody, they would then basically attack it and then break off and try to blame it on another country.
[01:43:33.727 --> 01:43:34.628]  No question about it.
[01:43:34.668 --> 01:43:43.413]  And if you want to know what the origin of the CIA is, go back to the OSS and who put the OSS together for the United States, British Intelligence, and William Stevenson.
[01:43:44.154 --> 01:43:48.477]  And the man called Intrepid and that whole business.
[01:43:48.517 --> 01:43:50.478]  And there's some new material out that would show you.
[01:43:50.498 --> 01:43:53.800]  See, the good book says there's nothing new under the sun.
[01:43:54.501 --> 01:44:01.325]  And so if you don't know, if you know history, I mean, you mentioned the Reichstag fire, which obviously came to mind in Oklahoma City.
[01:44:02.410 --> 01:44:03.691]  When people were looking at that.
[01:44:03.751 --> 01:44:07.734]  But let me read a quote from Franklin Roosevelt.
[01:44:08.394 --> 01:44:15.861]  I like to say that a page of history, and this is something that Oliver Wendell Holmes said in the Supreme Court opinion, a page of history is worth a volume of logic.
[01:44:16.681 --> 01:44:20.504]  So when you get down to the pages of history, this is a letter that Dennis Cuddy sent me.
[01:44:20.545 --> 01:44:22.326]  You may have a copy of it.
[01:44:22.346 --> 01:44:23.367]  You may be familiar with it.
[01:44:23.407 --> 01:44:26.089]  But I think it's very relevant when you were saying, who is this?
[01:44:26.149 --> 01:44:27.070]  Who is doing this?
[01:44:27.887 --> 01:44:41.912]  Roosevelt, on November 21st, on White House stationery with his signature on it, 1933, so he's only been in office six or seven months, writing to Colonel Mandel House, who was the alter ego in the White House, to Woodrow Wilson.
[01:44:42.112 --> 01:44:49.135]  And when Wilson campaigned in 1916 on he kept us out of war and the plans for getting us into World War I were already drawn up.
[01:44:49.635 --> 01:44:55.978]  This is what, it's really a personal letter in many ways, but there's a paragraph in there, Colonel E.M.
[01:44:56.078 --> 01:44:56.458]  House writes,
[01:44:57.448 --> 01:45:00.289]  November 21st, 1933, White House stationery.
[01:45:00.329 --> 01:45:10.234]  Quote, The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the larger centers has owned the government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson.
[01:45:10.934 --> 01:45:15.556]  And I'm not wholly accepting the administration of WW, Woodrow Wilson.
[01:45:16.097 --> 01:45:23.500]  The country is going through a repetition of Jackson's fight with the Bank of the United States, only on a far bigger and broader basis.
[01:45:24.355 --> 01:45:28.917]  So, you know, love of money is the root of all evil, and what he's saying is follow the money trail.
[01:45:29.557 --> 01:45:30.178]  Exactly.
[01:45:30.858 --> 01:45:33.319]  Before we take a few calls and spend a little bit of time on the U.N.
[01:45:33.359 --> 01:45:45.384]  and Michael Newcase, Colonel, is it safe to say, or is this statement accurate, that you smell something rotten in the state of Denmark when it comes to 9-11?
[01:45:46.725 --> 01:45:48.526]  I think that I'm astounded.
[01:45:49.201 --> 01:45:55.904]  That the conspiracy theory advanced by the administration could in fact be true.
[01:45:55.984 --> 01:45:59.225]  And the evidence does not seem to suggest that that's accurate.
[01:45:59.405 --> 01:45:59.865]  That's true.
[01:46:00.685 --> 01:46:08.448]  I think that's as true as the evidence that the war, our involvement in Vietnam could last nearly 21 years and we come out on the short end of the stick.
[01:46:08.548 --> 01:46:15.551]  When in point of fact we could have won the war by bombing Hanoi and mining Ha Phong, which we did in 73, we could have done that in 65.
[01:46:16.031 --> 01:46:17.011]  I agree.
[01:46:17.472 --> 01:46:18.492]  Who's up first here, guys?
[01:46:20.499 --> 01:46:23.820]  Ryan in New Jersey, you're on the air with Colonel Ronald Ray.
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:25.801]  Hi, Alex and Colonel.
[01:46:25.901 --> 01:46:27.781]  It's good to be able to talk to you.
[01:46:28.142 --> 01:46:30.342]  Alex, thanks so much for all the things you do.
[01:46:30.902 --> 01:46:39.525]  I'm like one class away from being a history teacher, and you turn my complete perspective all around on history and social events.
[01:46:41.046 --> 01:46:42.286]  So thank you very much for that.
[01:46:42.766 --> 01:46:45.067]  But as far as what you and the Colonel...
[01:46:45.575 --> 01:46:46.876]  We're going to get into it at the U.N.
[01:46:46.896 --> 01:46:52.838]  I don't know, did you see or read Congressman Ron Paul's speech last night?
[01:46:53.058 --> 01:46:53.519]  No, I didn't.
[01:46:54.399 --> 01:46:55.479]  It's excellent.
[01:46:55.499 --> 01:46:57.000]  And as far as the U.N.
[01:46:57.020 --> 01:47:07.205]  that you were going to get into, he even mentioned in the speech a little bit, it was all about what the citizens are getting angry about and about the war and social programs going wrong.
[01:47:07.365 --> 01:47:09.526]  We have the congressman on every month.
[01:47:09.546 --> 01:47:11.086]  He's scheduled to be on in two weeks.
[01:47:11.526 --> 01:47:12.087]  Oh, yeah, I know.
[01:47:12.127 --> 01:47:13.467]  I've been following you for a while.
[01:47:14.028 --> 01:47:15.048]  I've heard him plenty of times.
[01:47:16.735 --> 01:47:20.739]  And he goes into how we can't be in the U.N.
[01:47:20.779 --> 01:47:23.262]  and if we are carrying out U.N.
[01:47:23.302 --> 01:47:26.885]  resolutions that we're actually giving up our national sovereignty.
[01:47:26.905 --> 01:47:28.427]  Let me get a comment, and I appreciate your call.
[01:47:28.447 --> 01:47:30.749]  Let me get a comment from Colonel Ray on that.
[01:47:31.650 --> 01:47:33.652]  I mean, the cornucopia of things the U.N.
[01:47:33.732 --> 01:47:35.874]  is doing, what do you think is most important?
[01:47:36.775 --> 01:47:38.677]  Boy, obviously, it seems to me that
[01:47:39.434 --> 01:47:48.979]  You know, Mao said that political power goes out of the barrel of a gun, so obviously their ability to make use of the world's armed forces, including the U.S.
[01:47:49.059 --> 01:47:54.181]  armed forces, what I was doing in the Michael New case, there were two things that were important for me in that case.
[01:47:54.221 --> 01:48:02.245]  Number one is, I wanted to make sure that Michael, the reason I took the case was because Michael New was asking a question that was entirely appropriate to his rank.
[01:48:02.705 --> 01:48:06.307]  It wasn't going to be like the Vietnam challenges, where it was an immoral or illegal war,
[01:48:06.909 --> 01:48:11.070]  Where some NCO or some junior enlisted man wanted to challenge it.
[01:48:11.110 --> 01:48:13.631]  I thought that was extremely important.
[01:48:14.271 --> 01:48:22.274]  And therefore, he basically said, uniform regulations said that no foreign badges shall be worn on the battle dress uniform.
[01:48:22.654 --> 01:48:25.535]  That was regulations passed by Congress for everybody in the Army.
[01:48:25.835 --> 01:48:28.536]  Who's the expert in the military on uniforms?
[01:48:28.816 --> 01:48:31.117]  NCOs, not officers, not generals.
[01:48:32.058 --> 01:48:32.739]  It's NCOs.
[01:48:32.759 --> 01:48:33.900]  And so he asked a question.
[01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:34.801]  By what authority?
[01:48:35.161 --> 01:48:39.845]  And I helped him with this letter, and it was his letter, up the chain of command.
[01:48:39.905 --> 01:48:45.890]  By what authority do you ask me to wear the badge, the flag, the insignia, and the uniform of another government?
[01:48:46.090 --> 01:48:46.910]  And they wouldn't answer it.
[01:48:47.551 --> 01:48:48.211]  They didn't answer it.
[01:48:48.231 --> 01:48:49.412]  It went all the way up, and they said...
[01:48:50.580 --> 01:48:51.180]  Do it or else.
[01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:53.161]  In other words, political power goes out of the barrel of a gun.
[01:48:53.201 --> 01:48:55.881]  If you don't do this, we're going to prosecute you and throw you in jail.
[01:48:56.061 --> 01:48:56.701]  He's got the law.
[01:48:56.721 --> 01:48:57.362]  He's got the code.
[01:48:57.382 --> 01:48:58.202]  He's following the law.
[01:48:58.222 --> 01:49:00.862]  They're telling him to break the law without showing him another law.
[01:49:00.922 --> 01:49:01.343]  It's simple.
[01:49:01.383 --> 01:49:09.124]  He swore an oath to the Constitution, to the American people, and then they tried to tell him that he was going to be a mercenary there in Macedonia for the U.N.
[01:49:09.564 --> 01:49:19.347]  Well, and it was really interesting that when I did the discovery, and I was supposed to get a lot of documents turned over in December of 1995, and the trial was going to be in January of 1996, and they withheld...
[01:49:20.683 --> 01:49:23.805]  I think three or four presidential letters signed by Bill Clinton.
[01:49:24.546 --> 01:49:30.070]  And when we got a hold of those, it made it clear that Clinton lacked the authority to order the Macedonian operation.
[01:49:30.891 --> 01:49:34.573]  When we get back, tell us how that ended with Michael New.
[01:49:35.214 --> 01:49:37.456]  We will continue and take two final calls from Chris and Ron.
[01:49:37.476 --> 01:49:38.516]  That's all we have time for.
[01:49:38.556 --> 01:49:47.863]  Bob Dacey will be in the studio with us talking about the American Union, the NAFTA highways that are being built just a few miles from where I sit here in Austin, Texas.
[01:49:48.204 --> 01:49:49.985]  We'll be right back with Colonel Ronald D. Ray.
[01:49:52.415 --> 01:49:52.855]  We're good to go.
[01:50:10.401 --> 01:50:12.802]  The program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:50:12.962 --> 01:50:16.744]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[01:50:17.004 --> 01:50:21.647]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:50:21.707 --> 01:50:27.970]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:50:28.030 --> 01:50:29.851]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[01:50:48.065 --> 01:50:50.147]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.

[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:10.420]  We're good to go.
[01:51:10.521 --> 01:51:10.681]  I think?
[01:51:26.497 --> 01:51:26.997]  That's right.
[01:51:27.177 --> 01:51:34.281]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.

[01:52:46.897 --> 01:52:54.143]  Don't worry.
[01:52:57.050 --> 01:53:03.574]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:53:03.995 --> 01:53:08.118]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[01:53:08.638 --> 01:53:14.422]  And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire.
[01:53:14.462 --> 01:53:16.864]  Colonel Ray, how did that end with Michael in his case?
[01:53:17.625 --> 01:53:29.240]  Well, what they did was, in the trial, they excluded, we made a motion to dismiss, which should have been granted, and what they did, because it was an illegal order, and we proved it.
[01:53:29.380 --> 01:53:30.742]  We actually surveyed
[01:53:31.517 --> 01:53:41.003]  Every UN Security Council resolution since the founding of the UN, and there had never been an operation, a Chapter 6 UN military operation, which Clinton said it was.
[01:53:41.504 --> 01:53:48.028]  So by color of law, they were just attempting to set a precedent to hand our military over to United Nations control.
[01:53:48.388 --> 01:53:49.049]  But it's interesting.
[01:53:49.229 --> 01:53:55.335]  With the evidence excluded, in other words, he ordered the jury to find that it was an illegal order, which is a fact question that juries are supposed to determine.
[01:53:55.355 --> 01:53:56.416]  The military judge did.
[01:53:56.476 --> 01:54:08.307]  In fact, the prosecutor, a West Point graduate, who secreted the documents and then lied to the judge about the fact that he'd said, claiming that he'd turned them over and we somehow overlooked documents on White House stationery actually signed by the President of the United States.
[01:54:08.787 --> 01:54:14.112]  The jury, when they heard the limited case we were able to put on, realized that somehow the chain of command
[01:54:14.736 --> 01:54:16.817]  All right, let's take a call from Chris in Kentucky, your home state.
[01:54:16.877 --> 01:54:17.938]  Chris, you're on the air.
[01:54:17.958 --> 01:54:18.198]  Go ahead.
[01:54:18.218 --> 01:54:19.198]  Yes, thank you very much.
[01:54:19.218 --> 01:54:23.080]  Colonel Ray, you spoke at our Libertarian Party about several years ago, locally.
[01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:23.641]  Hello, Chris.
[01:54:23.661 --> 01:54:24.061]  I remember.
[01:54:24.081 --> 01:54:24.401]  Yes, thank you.
[01:54:24.421 --> 01:54:27.303]  Yes, it's good to hear your voice again, and I'm so glad.
[01:54:41.897 --> 01:54:57.082]  Honored to have you, and seeing as I've woken up onto a lot of issues, but we have to remember our veterans, the illnesses from the past, Agent Orange of Vietnam, and now we're getting this duplicated uranium all over Iraq, and these soldiers are going to get a lot sicker and more vaccinations.
[01:54:57.142 --> 01:55:01.163]  This is all about control, all about just misery of the U.N.
[01:55:01.707 --> 01:55:06.508]  There's no question about it, and there are issues that are before the Congress now, and the Veterans Affairs Committee.
[01:55:06.528 --> 01:55:08.469]  This administration has been particularly miserable.
[01:55:08.549 --> 01:55:11.810]  Jim Nicholson is the VA secretary in that.
[01:55:11.850 --> 01:55:13.270]  My son was in Iraq last year.
[01:55:13.290 --> 01:55:20.313]  His unit was mobilized in Roanoke, Virginia, and the equipment that they had over there was abysmal.
[01:55:20.353 --> 01:55:28.455]  But those things, people will wake up, get rid of the pseudo facts, understand there are plenty of lawful, legal things we can do,
[01:55:29.418 --> 01:55:30.179]  To make a difference.
[01:55:30.219 --> 01:55:37.443]  A lot of times when the bad things happen in Washington or in your state capitol, it's because we're not there and the truth isn't on the table.
[01:55:37.983 --> 01:55:41.606]  All that evil men need to flourish is that good men and women do nothing.
[01:55:41.626 --> 01:55:42.526]  Thanks for the call, Chris.
[01:55:42.786 --> 01:55:43.947]  Last call, Ron in Texas.
[01:55:43.987 --> 01:55:44.988]  Quickly, Ron, you're on the air.
[01:55:45.008 --> 01:55:46.609]  Hi, Alex.
[01:55:46.969 --> 01:55:47.129]  Hi.
[01:55:48.041 --> 01:55:50.302]  Hey, be sure to say hello to Bob for me.
[01:55:50.322 --> 01:55:54.184]  I used to work with you guys down at Access Studios doing guest stuff for George Humphrey.
[01:55:54.485 --> 01:55:57.786]  I've got just a quick comment and an important question for your guest.
[01:55:57.806 --> 01:56:13.515]  The comment was, I was just watching KU midday news looking for the weather because it started raining here in Atlanta, which is rare, and they had this story on about a woman who had a warrant issued and was pulled over by the police because she had an overdue library book.
[01:56:14.318 --> 01:56:15.399]  Police, state alert.
[01:56:15.799 --> 01:56:17.020]  Yeah, I appreciate your call.
[01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:24.786]  I mean, in a tyranny, Colonel, isn't it true that they make the most petty things criminal as a way to net the general population?
[01:56:24.806 --> 01:56:27.187]  Yeah, it's to intimidate.
[01:56:27.307 --> 01:56:36.154]  Remember that Sun Tzu, all the great theorists always said the greatest way to, if you can win without fighting, if you can win without fighting, and the idea is to intimidate.
[01:56:36.860 --> 01:56:38.341]  The idea is tyrannized.
[01:56:38.581 --> 01:56:50.045]  If you look at what percentage of the IRS budget, for example, actually about 70-80% of it, a significant portion of the IRS budget, it just goes to pay for its existence and its activities.
[01:56:50.652 --> 01:56:51.313]  What has it done?
[01:56:51.413 --> 01:56:53.034]  People are scared to death of the IRS.
[01:56:53.074 --> 01:57:01.703]  So one of the things you have to do is understand that you need to know who you are and you need to know how to conduct yourself in a responsible way.
[01:57:01.723 --> 01:57:02.343]  Well, it's clear, Colonel.
[01:57:02.384 --> 01:57:03.765]  It doesn't make a difference if we all show up.
[01:57:03.925 --> 01:57:04.365]  Sure.
[01:57:05.447 --> 01:57:08.409]  Colonel, it's clear that the government is trying to terrorize us at every level.
[01:57:09.350 --> 01:57:10.311]  I think that that's true.
[01:57:10.511 --> 01:57:14.055]  I think that that's the war of terror is terrorizing the citizens.
[01:57:15.026 --> 01:57:19.288]  Colonel, I want to get you back on to get more into the United Nations and the new case in the future.
[01:57:19.628 --> 01:57:20.828]  Thank you for spending time with us.
[01:57:20.989 --> 01:57:21.889]  Happy to do it, Alec.
[01:57:21.949 --> 01:57:24.090]  Enjoyed being with you and appreciate it.
[01:57:24.330 --> 01:57:26.611]  Keep doing what you're doing to educate people and wake them up.
[01:57:26.791 --> 01:57:27.331]  I'll try, sir.
[01:57:27.371 --> 01:57:27.891]  God bless you.
[01:57:27.951 --> 01:57:28.252]  You too.
[01:57:28.272 --> 01:57:28.512]  Bye.
[01:57:31.053 --> 01:57:34.954]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:35.274 --> 01:57:36.075]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:47.316 --> 01:57:47.937]  Big Brother.
[01:57:48.617 --> 01:57:49.678]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:50.378 --> 01:57:51.479]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:52.139 --> 01:57:52.960]  You want answers?
[01:57:53.720 --> 01:57:54.621]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:55.281 --> 01:57:58.964]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:59.464 --> 01:58:03.547]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.804 --> 01:58:18.250]  Continuing with our discussion of the growing global government, it's now finally been admitted by Lou Dobbs, by major newspapers and magazines in the United States, that Bush has signed the American Union deal.
[01:58:18.790 --> 01:58:27.094]  Last year, the President of Mexico and the Prime Minister of Canada, the CFR, has written up the plan that is being implemented.
[01:58:27.114 --> 01:58:30.456]  This is the real government here in the United States.
[01:58:31.176 --> 01:58:34.478]  A huge NAFTA highway that will also tax the American people.
[01:58:35.603 --> 01:58:36.484]  We're good to go.
[01:58:55.900 --> 01:58:59.901]  Then later admitting, no, this is really a European Union and you don't have a choice about it.
[01:58:59.941 --> 01:59:01.062]  Well, we do have a choice.
[01:59:01.422 --> 01:59:02.702]  We are going to say no to it.
[01:59:02.742 --> 01:59:06.244]  It's wildly unpopular with the American people and unconstitutional.
[01:59:06.504 --> 01:59:08.344]  Canadians and Mexicans don't like it either.
[01:59:08.644 --> 01:59:09.405]  We're here to fight it.
[01:59:11.797 --> 01:59:16.261]  Many months ago, I wrote a big article for the New American Magazine, a large national publication.
[01:59:16.541 --> 01:59:23.886]  Since then, Jerome Corsi's written big articles for World Net Daily and Human Events that got picked up even by other major news publications.
[01:59:24.486 --> 01:59:26.448]  The fact that we are going into an American Union.
[01:59:26.668 --> 01:59:28.970]  These federal bodies have already been set up.
[01:59:29.250 --> 01:59:34.013]  The federal bodies are already ceding our authority without Congress even having any oversight.
[01:59:34.414 --> 01:59:37.456]  If you think it's bad having an Arab Emirates take over some of our...
[01:59:38.557 --> 01:59:39.018]  We're good to go.
[01:59:53.400 --> 01:59:56.543]  Now, and joining us in studio is Bob Dacey.
[01:59:56.583 --> 02:00:10.997]  Bob, put it in a nutshell in the few minutes we've got now, what the American Union is, how far along we are, how we stop it, and let's come back and get into the new article you've written, quote, it's the law, feds pave way to toll and privatize the interstate highways.
[02:00:11.057 --> 02:00:11.498]  Bob Dacey?
[02:00:11.958 --> 02:00:13.159]  Thank you for having me on, Alex.
[02:00:13.379 --> 02:00:18.941]  The bottom line with the North American Union is it's just the next step to the entire American Union, the whole thing.
[02:00:18.981 --> 02:00:23.603]  You know, they want to, they've already got the European Union, now they're working on the American Union.
[02:00:23.903 --> 02:00:27.985]  They've run into some problems with their FTAA, their Free Trade Area of the Americas.
[02:00:28.005 --> 02:00:29.965]  Hugo Chavez doesn't like it.
[02:00:29.985 --> 02:00:31.766]  A lot of Americans are finding out about it.
[02:00:31.806 --> 02:00:32.847]  They're having some problems with it.
[02:00:33.507 --> 02:00:35.628]  And so now they're saying, okay, we'll just take a sub-step.
[02:00:35.648 --> 02:00:37.148]  We'll just do the North American Union.
[02:00:37.168 --> 02:00:41.350]  We'll just merge Canada, Mexico, and the United States into one big happy country.
[02:00:41.969 --> 02:00:44.310]  Which is similar to what they've done with the EU.
[02:00:44.330 --> 02:00:45.231]  They started small.
[02:00:45.271 --> 02:00:50.674]  They started small, and now they're trying to expand into a larger group, and that's just the plan.
[02:00:50.714 --> 02:00:55.177]  After they get that done, they're going to merge it into one big happy global government, and we'll all just be slaves.
[02:00:57.499 --> 02:01:00.080]  A lot of people have had trouble dealing with this.
[02:01:00.100 --> 02:01:01.061]  It's so amazing.
[02:01:01.101 --> 02:01:06.444]  But even when Lou Dobbs is admitting it on CNN, what effect do you think that's having on the population?
[02:01:07.068 --> 02:01:14.899]  Well, I am really encouraged to find out that the things that we've been talking about for years and years and years are finally reaching the mainstream media.
[02:01:15.540 --> 02:01:21.870]  Lou Dobbs has done an excellent job on the border issue, and this Jerome Corsi from Human Events is now...
[02:01:22.730 --> 02:01:25.933]  They write it up and within months our governments are implementing it.
[02:01:26.033 --> 02:01:28.495]  Yeah, it's quite a coincidence that the CFR would write this
[02:01:52.052 --> 02:02:00.220]  Building a North American community, and then Bush signs the SPP, the Security and Prosperity Partnership with Mexico and Canada, and lo and behold, they dovetail quite nicely.
[02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:00.801]  How about that?
[02:02:01.620 --> 02:02:11.607]  And right there on their own site, they admit it's an American Union, but then refuse to give any of the documents or minutes or agreements to even the Congress.
[02:02:11.627 --> 02:02:13.048]  They're saying, we're not going to give you anything.
[02:02:13.288 --> 02:02:18.312]  Well, you know, I think one of the articles in the Constitution says that Congress regulates foreign trade.
[02:02:18.932 --> 02:02:20.974]  And gee, I guess not in this case, huh?
[02:02:21.334 --> 02:02:22.775]  They're just bypassing the Congress.
[02:02:23.701 --> 02:02:25.682]  When we get back, Bob, I'm going to give you the floor.
[02:02:25.702 --> 02:02:34.344]  I want you to run through what globalism is, who the globalists are at first, then what the American Union is, what this will do, and then let's get into the new things that you've discovered.
[02:02:34.364 --> 02:02:39.186]  You've written an incredible, lengthy article that's up on Infowars.com right now.
[02:02:39.226 --> 02:02:39.646]  Stay with us.
[02:02:43.007 --> 02:02:47.348]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:47.548 --> 02:02:51.950]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:52.110 --> 02:02:53.290]  There is a chance
[02:02:53.882 --> 02:02:56.504]  To use this disaster as a new world order.
[02:02:56.604 --> 02:02:59.346]  A new world order can emerge.
[02:02:59.666 --> 02:03:03.890]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:03.950 --> 02:03:10.875]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:11.015 --> 02:03:13.017]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:13.277 --> 02:03:23.781]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:24.001 --> 02:03:29.343]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[02:03:29.883 --> 02:03:32.544]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[02:03:32.624 --> 02:03:33.784]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[02:03:42.467 --> 02:03:47.749]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[02:03:47.949 --> 02:03:50.030]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[02:03:50.270 --> 02:03:57.392]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[02:03:57.512 --> 02:04:09.056]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[02:04:09.437 --> 02:04:10.657]  It's multi-voltage capable
[02:04:10.677 --> 02:04:14.898]  Get the incredible Berkey Solar Charger for only $75 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:04:37.982 --> 02:04:46.184]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[02:04:46.424 --> 02:04:47.304]  Look no further.
[02:04:47.584 --> 02:04:50.165]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[02:04:50.605 --> 02:04:59.107]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[02:04:59.267 --> 02:05:00.927]  You can order everything you need on the web.
[02:05:01.227 --> 02:05:01.848]  We're good to go.
[02:05:16.749 --> 02:05:17.169]  We're good to go.
[02:05:17.189 --> 02:05:17.650]  We're good to go.
[02:05:17.690 --> 02:05:18.070]  We're good to go.
[02:05:43.866 --> 02:05:46.087]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:46.628 --> 02:05:49.489]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:51.170 --> 02:05:55.572]  It's hard to believe, it's hard for people to deal with it, but we're going into an American Union.
[02:05:56.473 --> 02:06:00.655]  And they're starting with the North American Union, Canada, the United States, Mexico.
[02:06:00.735 --> 02:06:07.599]  These giant corridors for telecommunications, cables, trains, ten lanes of cars.
[02:06:08.640 --> 02:06:09.120]  All of this...
[02:06:09.921 --> 02:06:21.032]  We'll be an international corridor under international law, and all of our trade will basically be focused through these corridors, and we will be taxed with transponders in our cars to pay for our own destruction.
[02:06:21.312 --> 02:06:26.737]  Private interests through our governments are setting up a regional government to then bypass all of our laws.
[02:06:27.278 --> 02:06:28.419]  It's all happening right now.
[02:06:28.439 --> 02:06:33.684]  It doesn't matter if 97% of Texans in polls are against all of this, even when they know a small part of the plan.
[02:06:35.265 --> 02:06:37.706]  Rick Perry and the rest of them are still going forward with it.
[02:06:37.746 --> 02:06:41.128]  Bob Daisy is one of the best researchers on this subject.
[02:06:41.148 --> 02:06:42.829]  He knows a lot more than even Jerome Corsi.
[02:06:42.869 --> 02:06:47.852]  He kind of came late to the party, but did get a lot of attention when he reported on it, so I commend him.
[02:06:48.232 --> 02:06:57.337]  Bob, run down who the globalists are, what the New World Order is, and then what these unions mean, and why roads are so important to controlling economies and civilizations.
[02:06:57.837 --> 02:07:00.100]  Well, Alex, it sounds so camp, so old.
[02:07:00.461 --> 02:07:01.282]  Who are the globalists?
[02:07:01.302 --> 02:07:05.167]  The globalists are the international bankers, the super-rich, the elite.
[02:07:05.848 --> 02:07:09.653]  In the United States, they're best exemplified by people like David Rockefeller.
[02:07:10.795 --> 02:07:12.437]  You have three basic organizations.
[02:07:12.477 --> 02:07:13.959]  You've got the Bilderberg Group, which is...
[02:07:15.077 --> 02:07:15.778]  We're good to go.
[02:07:15.798 --> 02:07:16.738]  We're good to go.
[02:07:39.973 --> 02:07:47.259]  You know, if he's a president of a major university, if he's the CEO of a big corporation, you know, look it up.
[02:07:47.299 --> 02:07:48.299]  He's probably CFR.
[02:07:48.520 --> 02:07:50.841]  And also they've got the legal community, too.
[02:07:51.382 --> 02:07:54.784]  So you've got this group of people.
[02:07:55.005 --> 02:08:01.930]  They're taking orders from a higher group of people, which is the international bankers, the guys that lend everybody the money.
[02:08:01.950 --> 02:08:04.952]  And it sounds so Orwellian.
[02:08:04.972 --> 02:08:05.873]  It doesn't sound real.
[02:08:05.993 --> 02:08:07.354]  But the fact of the matter, it is real.
[02:08:08.115 --> 02:08:10.917]  And they manipulate everything from behind the scenes.
[02:08:11.458 --> 02:08:18.023]  The CFR has 500 or 600 members of that organization in the United States government at the highest levels.
[02:08:18.806 --> 02:08:20.107]  It's hard to find one who isn't.
[02:08:20.127 --> 02:08:28.689]  Of course, President Bush isn't, because I think you generally have to be pretty smart to be in the CFR, but the people that he surrounds himself with are.
[02:08:28.930 --> 02:08:42.934]  But his father was one of the chairmen of it, and let's not forget, Edward Rockefeller just wrote a book two years ago, his autobiography, and in it he says, people have accused me of wanting global government and taking people's national sovereignty away, and if that's the charge, guilty is charged.
[02:08:44.995 --> 02:08:51.625]  Actually, what he actually says, Alex, it's in a book he wrote in 2002 called Memoirs, David Rockefeller's own book, on page 405.
[02:08:53.261 --> 02:08:53.842]  I will quote it.
[02:08:53.902 --> 02:09:09.814]  Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as internationalists, and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure.
[02:09:10.535 --> 02:09:12.276]  One world, if you will.
[02:09:12.757 --> 02:09:16.440]  If that is a charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.
[02:09:16.740 --> 02:09:20.363]  Now that's right out of David Rockefeller's own mouth, so how don't they go arrest him for treason?
[02:09:22.446 --> 02:09:31.075]  We have Strobe Talbot when he was one of the editors at Newsweek right before he joined Clinton back in 1993 saying that we're going to get rid of national sovereignty.
[02:09:31.095 --> 02:09:32.196]  It wasn't such a good idea.
[02:09:32.597 --> 02:09:34.859]  After all, in the near future, we're going to abolish this country.
[02:09:35.140 --> 02:09:40.665]  Yeah, was that the end run around national sovereignty will be more effective than the old-fashioned frontal assault?
[02:09:40.705 --> 02:09:42.087]  Was that him or was that somebody else?
[02:09:42.427 --> 02:09:43.888]  Well, he's got a lot of quotes.
[02:09:43.908 --> 02:09:44.968]  Yeah, there was a bunch of them.
[02:09:45.048 --> 02:10:05.176]  I mean, they are actively and have been doing this for decades, seeking to destroy the national sovereignty of the United States of America and merge us into this one world government, which will be totalitarian in nature, and they want to use the UN structure as their framework or enforcer to get this done.
[02:10:05.928 --> 02:10:19.411]  Let's break down Agenda 21, regional governments, how they set these up and then move the authority away from the elected bodies to themselves and then pay off Congress and state governments to cede that authority, which is totally unconstitutional, and then let's get into the American Union.
[02:10:20.123 --> 02:10:22.645]  Well, you know, Agenda 21 is what?
[02:10:22.685 --> 02:10:23.866]  That's pretty old now.
[02:10:24.246 --> 02:10:27.188]  And they were trying to do what?
[02:10:27.308 --> 02:10:28.549]  I don't even remember, Alex.
[02:10:28.589 --> 02:10:30.030]  Tell me, because I don't remember.
[02:10:30.050 --> 02:10:32.812]  Well, it's a whole raft of things, but it gets into the regional governments.
[02:10:33.092 --> 02:10:34.753]  Disloving the borders was part of it.
[02:10:34.773 --> 02:10:43.379]  I remember they were talking about a 20-mile fuzzy area between the United States and Mexico at that time, and now they're just talking about obliterating the borders altogether.
[02:10:45.340 --> 02:10:47.882]  You've got the local... The thing that...
[02:10:49.216 --> 02:10:50.939]  I'm getting some weird feedback in here.
[02:10:50.999 --> 02:10:53.041]  Yeah, that happens every once in a while.
[02:10:53.141 --> 02:10:54.143]  We'll... There it goes.
[02:10:54.203 --> 02:10:54.543]  It's gone.
[02:10:54.583 --> 02:10:55.524]  Are we good now, network?
[02:10:55.925 --> 02:10:56.245]  Yeah.
[02:10:56.425 --> 02:10:58.428]  Okay.
[02:10:58.488 --> 02:11:01.191]  You've got... The way they're doing... Let me just ask you.
[02:11:01.231 --> 02:11:02.072]  Genesis, are we good?
[02:11:03.114 --> 02:11:03.474]  Okay, good.
[02:11:03.695 --> 02:11:04.175]  Keep rolling.
[02:11:04.496 --> 02:11:06.358]  The way they're doing this is to fake everybody out.
[02:11:06.418 --> 02:11:07.820]  I mean, this is a global...
[02:11:08.655 --> 02:11:09.596]  We're good to go.
[02:11:31.039 --> 02:11:35.189]  I immediately knew that it was to implement the FTAA, the Free Trade Area of the Americas.
[02:11:35.550 --> 02:11:39.920]  They're trying to trick everybody into paying for their own destruction.
[02:11:40.609 --> 02:11:45.052]  And then sure enough, you went out and found their own documents, and then sure enough, it was the globalist.
[02:11:45.312 --> 02:11:47.994]  Yeah, I mean, it's there in your face.
[02:11:48.054 --> 02:12:00.582]  Last year, the New American sent me to Waco to cover the Free Trade in the Americas Conference, which was a follow-up to the conference that Bush had with the President of Mexico and the Prime Minister of Canada, again at Baylor.
[02:12:01.282 --> 02:12:04.245]  So they set up that SPP, the Security and Prosperity Partnership.
[02:12:04.526 --> 02:12:08.229]  Well, in October they had another meeting and I went up there to cover it.
[02:12:08.650 --> 02:12:15.316]  And I'm sitting there in the room with all the high and mighty hoity-toity people having their sit-down catered dinner.
[02:12:15.736 --> 02:12:20.221]  And I'm listening to the former head of the WTO, Dr. Supachai Panchpakti,
[02:12:21.002 --> 02:12:31.206]  Sit there and just tell everybody, listen, you need to have infrastructure to link the areas, the trade areas, so that everyone can participate.
[02:12:31.506 --> 02:12:33.327]  Right out of his mouth, he was 20 feet away from me.
[02:12:33.347 --> 02:12:34.407]  I had my tape recorder going.
[02:12:35.047 --> 02:12:40.009]  So you say, oh, so you need the infrastructure to link the areas of the trade together to make it work.
[02:12:40.069 --> 02:12:42.530]  Well, what do you think all this is?
[02:12:42.570 --> 02:12:47.772]  That's the Trans-Texas Corridor, which is a subset of the NASCO Corridor,
[02:12:48.690 --> 02:12:57.392]  Which is a subset of this gigantic NAFTA superhighway that's going to go all the way up to Canada, all the way down to Mexico and eventually into Central America and into South America.
[02:12:57.812 --> 02:13:01.233]  I mean, you read the playbook, it's not hard to see what they're doing.
[02:13:01.653 --> 02:13:06.135]  But they've been trying to fake everybody out by non-disclosure because they control the press.
[02:13:06.375 --> 02:13:07.195]  But they don't control us.
[02:13:08.306 --> 02:13:15.916]  In fact, they've told the state of Texas when the legislature asked for the documents about giving 8,000 miles, it was going to be six, now it's 8,000 miles.
[02:13:15.936 --> 02:13:17.559]  That's more than the whole country has in toll roads.
[02:13:17.959 --> 02:13:22.846]  In Texas, every major road in every major city, Dallas, San Antonio, Austin, El Paso,
[02:13:23.506 --> 02:13:25.848]  And how are they then going to fund it?
[02:13:25.868 --> 02:13:35.233]  They're going to put a transponder in every car and tax you as you drive down the road and track where you go and give you tickets when you speed and arrest you the minute that your insurance is out.
[02:13:35.294 --> 02:13:38.636]  I mean, forget the NSA spying on us.
[02:13:38.896 --> 02:13:39.716]  This dwarfs that.
[02:13:39.896 --> 02:13:43.278]  But again, they have to do it at a local or state level.
[02:13:43.338 --> 02:13:48.762]  And you will recall and I will recall that we, I don't know who exactly was it in our community that did it,
[02:13:49.202 --> 02:13:53.245]  Found a little clause in an insurance bill in the state legislature.
[02:13:53.485 --> 02:13:54.306]  Was it last year?
[02:13:54.526 --> 02:14:02.391]  Where they were trying to sneak the requirement for toll tag transponders in everybody's car under the guise of catching people that aren't insured.
[02:14:03.232 --> 02:14:06.955]  And then Jeff Cantop, one of your TV producers, actually found that and alerted me.
[02:14:07.255 --> 02:14:10.737]  And then it said in there, oh, and we're going to use this for the toll roads.
[02:14:10.877 --> 02:14:13.720]  Which Rick Perry and others have said, don't worry, there won't be toll booths.
[02:14:14.060 --> 02:14:15.020]  It's going to be wireless.
[02:14:15.080 --> 02:14:16.582]  Well, here it was in the bill.
[02:14:16.862 --> 02:14:18.043]  We barely beat that.
[02:14:18.103 --> 02:14:18.423]  Thanks God.
[02:14:18.883 --> 02:14:27.267]  Thank God that Jeff Cantoff, you know, is the type of person that just spent time looking around on the state transportation website about pending legislation.
[02:14:27.428 --> 02:14:35.712]  Yeah, Jeff Cantoff and Kelly Taylor are the two people that produced my local TV show called The Simple Truth, which has been on the air in Austin for seven years now.
[02:14:36.052 --> 02:14:36.652]  Hard to believe.
[02:14:36.812 --> 02:14:39.734]  Yeah, it's been a while, Alex, and of course you're the guy that got me started in all this.
[02:14:40.487 --> 02:14:42.289]  Yeah, you messed me up big time, buddy.
[02:14:43.631 --> 02:14:52.402]  I was a conservative Republican, clueless, trying to figure out what the heck was going on, and then I ran into you and tried to prove you wrong, and gee, I couldn't.
[02:14:54.705 --> 02:15:04.070]  Bob, shifting gears, and then we'll get back into the NAFTA highways and what's happening here in Texas and how we defeated this new article you've written about how Bush has signed a law basically to allow all of this federally.
[02:15:04.390 --> 02:15:16.616]  We had Colonel Ronald D. Ray on, who worked at the highest levels of the Pentagon on the Reagan administration, defended Michael New, was the private lawyer of the former chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Moore, and he said, yeah, the 9-11 story is a fraud.
[02:15:16.656 --> 02:15:18.117]  He said that last hour.
[02:15:18.477 --> 02:15:24.100]  What are they going to do as more and more prominent people go public and say the official story is totally impossible?
[02:15:24.620 --> 02:15:29.062]  Well, I think what they have been doing is they bring them on TV and try to make them look like idiots.
[02:15:29.442 --> 02:15:31.303]  It's not working, but that's what they do.
[02:15:31.403 --> 02:15:36.986]  Like, wasn't it just today that, who was that fellow you had on the other day?
[02:15:39.727 --> 02:15:40.088]  Fetzer.
[02:15:40.528 --> 02:15:44.090]  Fetzer, Jim Fetzer, who runs that 911 Scholars for Truth.
[02:15:44.570 --> 02:15:46.751]  I mean, they had him on Laura Ingraham.
[02:15:47.383 --> 02:15:47.863]  We're good to go.
[02:15:47.883 --> 02:15:49.344]  We're good to go.
[02:16:06.497 --> 02:16:08.758]  Do you think they miscalculated the global list carrying out 9-11?
[02:16:08.818 --> 02:16:16.622]  I mean, it was so obvious, it had so many faults to it, that I think they've overreached as elites have done throughout history.
[02:16:16.742 --> 02:16:25.086]  Well, I think you're right, but the fact of the matter is it's 2006 now, and they have gotten away with it for five years.
[02:16:25.166 --> 02:16:28.028]  I mean, they are slowly not getting away with it, but...
[02:16:28.428 --> 02:16:30.610]  I mean, look, you know, they control the mainstream press.
[02:16:30.670 --> 02:16:36.634]  If you go out on the street right now and ask the average guy, you know, who did September 11th, he's going to tell you Osama did it.
[02:16:36.994 --> 02:16:37.975]  And we've got a lot of work to do.
[02:16:38.035 --> 02:16:40.577]  We've done a lot of work, but we've got a lot of work to do.
[02:16:40.757 --> 02:16:43.759]  So, you know, but I think we're winning for sure.
[02:16:45.091 --> 02:16:45.971]  Well, yeah, Bob.
[02:16:46.011 --> 02:16:53.473]  I mean, major polls, half the people think the government did it now in a major Zogby poll, and 68% think there's a massive cover-up.
[02:16:53.493 --> 02:16:57.594]  So I think we're starting to, the people are starting to realize the world is really round.
[02:16:57.874 --> 02:16:59.214]  It's not flat like they were told.
[02:16:59.495 --> 02:17:09.157]  Well, when you start hitting people directly in the face with a monthly bill from their toll tag just for driving around all over the place and going to see Grandma,
[02:17:09.817 --> 02:17:11.879]  It's going to help wake a lot of people up.
[02:17:11.919 --> 02:17:15.242]  I mean, if they're going to actually send you a bill, you know, here's $200.
[02:17:15.782 --> 02:17:16.923]  You drove around this month.
[02:17:18.284 --> 02:17:21.867]  Yeah, it's going to give us a lot of credibility because we've been telling people about this for years.
[02:17:22.047 --> 02:17:22.868]  But it's a lot more than $200.
[02:17:22.988 --> 02:17:24.549]  Oh, whatever it's going to be.
[02:17:24.709 --> 02:17:25.129]  I don't know.
[02:17:25.190 --> 02:17:27.271]  It's 15 cents a mile just west of Austin.
[02:17:27.291 --> 02:17:30.534]  That's going to effectively double the price of gas when you're on that thing.
[02:17:32.523 --> 02:17:33.505]  Bob Dacey's our guest.
[02:17:33.525 --> 02:17:40.576]  We'll get back into the American Union and how it ties into seizing our roads and building this new superhighway that will be international.
[02:17:43.968 --> 02:17:47.251]  Do you remember when you could eat most anything and not worry about it?
[02:17:47.752 --> 02:17:49.914]  Or maybe weight management has always been a problem.
[02:17:50.434 --> 02:17:55.800]  Are you frustrated, burned out, and tired of fad diets and marketing gimmicks that don't really work?
[02:17:56.340 --> 02:18:02.206]  Do you want a proven system, a long-term solution to live a healthier lifestyle and properly manage your weight?
[02:18:02.964 --> 02:18:06.048]  At WeCanTogether.com, our approach is different.

[02:18:11.856 --> 02:18:13.879]  Individual needs and personal goals.
[02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:16.643]  Not the cookie cutter approach offered by others.

[02:18:48.690 --> 02:18:51.952]  Currency devaluation, inflation, one and the same.
[02:18:52.672 --> 02:18:56.674]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:19:02.938 --> 02:19:03.678]  We're good to go.
[02:19:03.698 --> 02:19:03.918]  I think?
[02:19:26.826 --> 02:19:27.046]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:43.180 --> 02:19:46.061]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:19:46.401 --> 02:19:49.282]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:19:49.502 --> 02:19:55.704]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfalls, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[02:19:56.085 --> 02:20:03.387]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[02:20:03.567 --> 02:20:05.748]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes,
[02:20:05.968 --> 02:20:06.428]  We're good to go.

[02:20:42.634 --> 02:20:47.916]  Dry cracked heels used to be a real problem for me, especially in the summer when I wear sandals.
[02:20:48.176 --> 02:20:50.757]  My husband would say, your heels are like sandpaper.
[02:20:51.197 --> 02:20:53.758]  But then my podiatrist gave me Calix Ointment.
[02:20:54.118 --> 02:20:59.080]  It's diabetic friendly and smooths cracked heels and calluses using natural enzymes.
[02:20:59.320 --> 02:21:02.862]  Calix never stings or burns and made my heels baby soft.
[02:21:03.182 --> 02:21:04.742]  Now they look and feel great.
[02:21:05.082 --> 02:21:08.564]  If you have calluses or dry cracked heels, try Calix Ointment.
[02:21:08.884 --> 02:21:11.785]  You can find it at Walgreens and Longs in the foot care section.
[02:21:13.243 --> 02:21:15.724]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[02:21:16.184 --> 02:21:18.085]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[02:21:18.805 --> 02:21:21.986]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[02:21:22.626 --> 02:21:29.089]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[02:21:29.889 --> 02:21:32.070]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[02:21:32.450 --> 02:21:32.910]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:32.990 --> 02:21:34.371]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:45.934 --> 02:21:49.416]  Bob Dacey, expert on the American Union, the NAFTA highways.
[02:21:50.717 --> 02:21:55.279]  It's happening right now, but the local newspapers will not report on it.
[02:21:56.300 --> 02:21:58.321]  Texas is falling to this right now.
[02:21:59.982 --> 02:22:07.846]  You've got stacks of documents, correspondence, maps, things they pulled off their website we posted that Corsi doesn't even have.
[02:22:08.406 --> 02:22:09.467]  Get into it for us, Bob.
[02:22:10.769 --> 02:22:21.202]  When I first got into this, it was because I was aware that this North American Union thing was a subset of the actual American Union, the whole Western Hemisphere.
[02:22:21.702 --> 02:22:24.065]  That's the FTAA, Free Trade Area of the Americas.
[02:22:24.085 --> 02:22:27.750]  George Bush publicly, openly said he wanted it created by December of 2005 or whatever.
[02:22:29.352 --> 02:22:29.672]  I think.
[02:22:41.338 --> 02:22:42.339]  Well, you can't do that.
[02:22:42.359 --> 02:22:43.099]  That's un-American.
[02:22:43.119 --> 02:22:44.160]  That's double taxation.
[02:22:44.620 --> 02:22:52.345]  I immediately realized that the tolling of existing roads was to pay for the infrastructure length to build the North American Union.
[02:22:52.705 --> 02:22:53.806]  It was patently obvious.
[02:22:54.206 --> 02:23:02.672]  So I already knew that because I've read their battle plan, and so then I went to the Texas Department of Transportation website to look around, and I found...
[02:23:03.731 --> 02:23:10.853]  The map that they had put up then, which shows Texas in the middle with giant arrows pointing up into Canada and into Mexico.
[02:23:11.533 --> 02:23:12.194]  And there it was.
[02:23:12.234 --> 02:23:17.615]  And they said that Texas was the linchpin of the whole thing just because of the geography.
[02:23:18.015 --> 02:23:18.815]  So there it was.
[02:23:19.216 --> 02:23:20.556]  Then I found a map.
[02:23:21.356 --> 02:23:28.878]  On the TxDOT website, showing how the Trans-Texas Corridor was supposed to link up with Mexico's highway and railway system.
[02:23:28.898 --> 02:23:30.698]  So it's not like I'm a genius.
[02:23:30.939 --> 02:23:32.559]  It's just we know what the deal is.
[02:23:32.919 --> 02:23:38.460]  There it was, and we knew about it before most anybody else did.
[02:23:38.520 --> 02:23:39.621]  It wasn't a big deal.
[02:23:41.940 --> 02:24:05.745]  When, like, Texas Toll Party, one of their affiliates, San Antonio Toll Party, when I wrote my article in 2005 about the Texas Keystone State of the FTAA and the New American, well, they posted the article on the San Antonio Toll Party website with a headline, Local Tolls Really to Merge North and South America?
[02:24:06.425 --> 02:24:07.466]  Sounds kind of nutty.
[02:24:08.206 --> 02:24:09.106]  But guess what?
[02:24:09.873 --> 02:24:11.178]  Welcome to the Nuthouse, y'all.
[02:24:11.499 --> 02:24:13.687]  That's exactly what it is, and now it's mainstream.
[02:24:14.486 --> 02:24:24.092]  In their own plan, the state of Texas admits that the tolling of existing roads is to pay for this entire program.
[02:24:24.132 --> 02:24:25.913]  So it's in their own documents.
[02:24:26.173 --> 02:24:34.498]  Yeah, and not only that, you know, they've been still lying and lying about, oh, this trans-Texas corridor was Governor Rick Perry's idea.
[02:24:34.898 --> 02:24:36.019]  Oh, I'm sure it was.
[02:24:36.099 --> 02:24:42.863]  I'm sure that Rick Perry, somehow it got into his head the same time it got into the Governor North of him and the Governor North of him and the Governor North of him.
[02:24:43.343 --> 02:24:43.884]  We're good to go.
[02:25:07.663 --> 02:25:10.164]  Then that brings us to Bush's amnesty plan.
[02:25:10.204 --> 02:25:12.204]  He says, I'm going to end illegal immigration.
[02:25:12.224 --> 02:25:14.065]  Well, yeah, he's going to legalize all of them.
[02:25:14.425 --> 02:25:17.766]  And under the amnesty plan, workers are unlimited.
[02:25:17.786 --> 02:25:19.707]  They're allowed to pour in at any level they want.
[02:25:20.007 --> 02:25:21.127]  You think it's bad now, folks?
[02:25:21.147 --> 02:25:22.368]  We're talking about unlimited.
[02:25:22.668 --> 02:25:29.330]  The Building a North American Community document, the CFR document published last year, Robert Pastor, who's a Marxist, by the way,
[02:25:29.890 --> 02:25:36.514]  You don't need an amnesty, really, when you just, in a few years, you just dissolve the borders and everybody can go where they want, right?
[02:25:51.081 --> 02:25:54.643]  Did you know that Mexican trucks are already driving all over the United States?
[02:25:54.683 --> 02:26:02.527]  Yeah, and not only that, but if I'm not mistaken, there was a law passed allowing them to do so and not have to worry about all the safety regulations.
[02:26:03.928 --> 02:26:05.669]  So, there's another example.
[02:26:05.809 --> 02:26:10.711]  The foreign cheap labor never has to meet the specifications that citizens do.
[02:26:11.271 --> 02:26:14.233]  This is designed to destroy us economically, and the elites say that.
[02:26:14.273 --> 02:26:16.114]  They say it's about driving down wages.
[02:26:16.644 --> 02:26:24.706]  Yeah, and it's funny that Mexico is in this particular plan, this NASCO corridor plan, the one that goes up through Mexico, through Texas, all the way up to Canada.
[02:26:24.726 --> 02:26:25.566]  They're being given the roads.
[02:26:25.807 --> 02:26:38.390]  Yeah, and not only that, but the purpose of it is they're going to be offloading all these Chinese goods on the southwestern coast of Mexico, running them straight to the border, what they call a road bump.
[02:26:39.362 --> 02:26:43.804]  And the first port they come to, I said port, is Kansas City.
[02:26:44.084 --> 02:26:50.726]  And they're being given, by the way, that facility, foreign governments owning and controlling key roads.
[02:26:50.886 --> 02:26:54.567]  Yeah, and everybody knows that Mexico is a crookocracy.
[02:26:55.087 --> 02:26:58.888]  I mean, you can't do anything in Mexico unless you pass the money to somebody.
[02:26:59.468 --> 02:27:06.110]  And they're going to be in charge of a quote-unquote port facility in Kansas City in the middle of the United States of America.
[02:27:06.651 --> 02:27:08.111]  Now, that's too insane, but it's true.
[02:27:08.709 --> 02:27:10.309]  We're on in Kansas City right now.
[02:27:10.329 --> 02:27:13.250]  I want to thank KCXL for carrying the show for almost eight years.
[02:27:14.170 --> 02:27:17.011]  And there's a lot of listeners there in Kansas City that don't believe the stuff we talk about.
[02:27:17.031 --> 02:27:21.912]  Well, just wait until the Mexican government's running that major railway station in 100 miles south of there.
[02:27:22.352 --> 02:27:24.392]  And I saw a document where it's going to connect up to St.
[02:27:24.412 --> 02:27:25.193]  Louis after that.
[02:27:25.213 --> 02:27:26.973]  We'll be right back with Bob Dacey.
[02:27:27.013 --> 02:27:28.393]  We'll continue to break this down.
[02:27:28.833 --> 02:27:30.494]  You haven't even heard the tip of the iceberg yet.
[02:27:30.514 --> 02:27:30.994]  Stay with us.
[02:27:33.494 --> 02:27:34.395]  We're on the march.
[02:27:34.875 --> 02:27:36.395]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:37.410 --> 02:27:40.211]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:43.192 --> 02:27:47.234]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:27:47.454 --> 02:27:50.856]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:27:51.036 --> 02:27:54.477]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:27:54.767 --> 02:27:58.009]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:27:58.029 --> 02:28:03.512]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:28:03.552 --> 02:28:13.178]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:28:13.298 --> 02:28:14.639]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[02:28:14.679 --> 02:28:20.082]  I mean, the idea of working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:28:20.567 --> 02:28:25.031]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:28:25.091 --> 02:28:26.473]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:28:26.633 --> 02:28:31.297]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com That toll-free number again?
[02:28:31.317 --> 02:28:31.377]  1-877-928-8822
[02:28:42.978 --> 02:28:44.959]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[02:28:45.039 --> 02:28:55.744]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:28:56.124 --> 02:29:00.646]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:29:00.706 --> 02:29:12.052]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:29:12.632 --> 02:29:19.479]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:29:19.880 --> 02:29:22.022]  Your purified water is now ready.
[02:29:22.523 --> 02:29:27.468]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[02:29:27.768 --> 02:29:28.729]  We're good to go.
[02:29:28.969 --> 02:29:29.410]  We're good to go.
[02:29:56.732 --> 02:29:57.152]  We're good to go.
[02:30:20.759 --> 02:30:21.960]  Let's be clear, an international private body
[02:30:49.494 --> 02:30:57.614]  With federal agencies ceding power to them is seizing control of roads all over the United States to tax us with transponders.
[02:30:58.795 --> 02:31:04.698]  With cashless toll booths to fund handing over almost all the major highway systems in the country.
[02:31:05.118 --> 02:31:08.660]  The major NAFTA highway to the middle branches out into a whole bunch of others.
[02:31:09.100 --> 02:31:10.941]  This is all happening right now.
[02:31:11.542 --> 02:31:16.404]  And President Bush, of course, has signed a law to allow this handover to begin.
[02:31:16.464 --> 02:31:18.705]  Bob Dacey, you've written a new article for us.
[02:31:18.866 --> 02:31:19.526]  It's the law.
[02:31:19.626 --> 02:31:23.228]  Feds pave the way for toll and privatization of the interstate highways.
[02:31:23.268 --> 02:31:25.229]  And I want to ask permission to add to that.
[02:31:26.410 --> 02:31:29.715]  For an American Union, so people know exactly what they're reading, Bob.
[02:31:30.015 --> 02:31:30.937]  Absolutely, Alex.
[02:31:31.758 --> 02:31:33.580]  The article was easy to write.
[02:31:33.700 --> 02:31:34.742]  I was doing some research.
[02:31:35.925 --> 02:31:44.850]  Kelly Taylor do some research on the Canamex Corridor, which is another corridor that they're building west of here, Arizona, all the way up through the United States into Canada.
[02:31:45.311 --> 02:31:47.472]  And I went to the Canamex website.
[02:31:47.612 --> 02:31:51.975]  And by the way, by building, they're seizing, as the key corridor, already existing roads.
[02:31:52.275 --> 02:31:52.855]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:31:53.175 --> 02:31:57.638]  And so I saw that the website, the news section of it, was inactive.
[02:31:57.678 --> 02:32:02.641]  So I sent a short email to the director of the Canamex project and said,
[02:32:03.408 --> 02:32:05.910]  Just a short email saying, hey, is this dormant?
[02:32:05.950 --> 02:32:08.853]  Has this been abandoned in favor of NASCO?
[02:32:09.634 --> 02:32:12.096]  Well, she fires back an email, very friendly.
[02:32:12.136 --> 02:32:13.137]  She thinks I'm in the know.
[02:32:13.157 --> 02:32:14.438]  She thinks I know everything.
[02:32:14.498 --> 02:32:15.419]  She thinks I'm one of them.
[02:32:16.120 --> 02:32:23.046]  And she tells me that, no, we're doing all kinds of things, and we've got 80 new corridors now that have been designated by the feds.
[02:32:23.126 --> 02:32:23.907]  And this is all in your...
[02:32:24.798 --> 02:32:25.979]  This is all in your new article.
[02:32:26.019 --> 02:32:26.639]  Some of it is.
[02:32:26.659 --> 02:32:28.880]  I want to make sure we get all these documents scanned and are linked.
[02:32:29.220 --> 02:32:44.427]  Yeah, and she tells me that there's 80 corridors now, and that this bill, this SAFE TEA-LU, S-A-F-E-T-E-A-L-U bill, authorized all kinds of goodies for them, and they're participating with NASCO, and they think it's just wonderful.
[02:32:44.787 --> 02:32:46.428]  And so I'm going, what is all this?
[02:32:46.468 --> 02:32:48.409]  So I go to this bill, this SAFE TEA.
[02:32:48.429 --> 02:32:51.490]  It stands for Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient,
[02:32:51.750 --> 02:32:53.371]  Transportation Equity Act.
[02:32:53.451 --> 02:32:58.053]  So you sent one email and suddenly learned of 18 more superhighways.
[02:32:58.473 --> 02:33:00.354]  Yeah, they got, you know, she thinks I'm one of them.
[02:33:00.414 --> 02:33:01.555]  She sends me this information.
[02:33:01.735 --> 02:33:03.696]  I mean, folks, we probably only know about 10% of this.
[02:33:03.716 --> 02:33:12.540]  Yeah, and then she sends me a fact sheet about all their accomplishments and what they're doing and what they're planning on doing and their cyber port they're going to put in Nogales, Arizona.
[02:33:13.060 --> 02:33:14.420]  A port in Arizona, you got that?
[02:33:14.721 --> 02:33:17.102]  Show the camera these documents, please, and articles, emails.
[02:33:17.162 --> 02:33:17.382]  Well, sure.
[02:33:17.722 --> 02:33:18.402]  Well, sure.
[02:33:18.662 --> 02:33:29.185]  This is the email that I got from this Marissa Walker here, who is the Marissa Paula Walker Executive Director of the Canamex Corridor Coalition.
[02:33:30.065 --> 02:33:34.026]  And it says I'm not supposed to disclose this to anybody.
[02:33:34.906 --> 02:33:36.366]  Well, I guess I will anyway.
[02:33:37.067 --> 02:33:44.988]  And the article that I wrote on Infowars.com that you were kind enough to post is your front
[02:33:47.885 --> 02:33:51.167]  Upper left-hand corner article right now on InfoWars.com on the 30th.
[02:33:51.207 --> 02:33:53.249]  We're getting that crackling again.
[02:33:53.269 --> 02:33:57.012]  That only happens when we have a key guest on.
[02:33:57.512 --> 02:33:58.853]  Network, is everything going good there?
[02:34:00.620 --> 02:34:02.861]  Anytime you hear us do that, just let us know if it's okay, okay?
[02:34:03.601 --> 02:34:04.601]  Go ahead and start over.
[02:34:04.621 --> 02:34:09.363]  That only happens when key things are being discussed with our connection to Minnesota.
[02:34:09.583 --> 02:34:10.463]  Show us the article again.
[02:34:10.663 --> 02:34:14.164]  Okay, so again, the article is up on InfoWars.com.
[02:34:14.504 --> 02:34:16.325]  Today is the 30th of June.
[02:34:16.805 --> 02:34:19.146]  Right here, front page article on InfoWars.com.
[02:34:20.226 --> 02:34:32.077]  Basically, what it says is, I found out that this SAFE TEA-LU bill, which was signed last year at this time, it's one of those big telephone book thick bills.
[02:34:32.357 --> 02:34:43.387]  Well, somebody stuck in Section 1604, which authorizes several projects which authorize the tolling of existing freeway systems on the interstate system.
[02:34:44.136 --> 02:34:50.499]  And I've listed them here in the article, and it's public information if people will just go look at it.
[02:34:51.299 --> 02:34:55.141]  They've got an Interstate System Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Pilot Program.
[02:34:55.661 --> 02:35:01.864]  And what that allows is to toll existing interstate highways, bridges, and tunnels to fund repair.
[02:35:01.984 --> 02:35:04.245]  So now they're going to say, okay, we need to fix this highway.
[02:35:04.285 --> 02:35:04.925]  Well, let's toll it.
[02:35:05.666 --> 02:35:08.367]  Even though we've already paid for it, the maintenance is going to be tolled.
[02:35:08.877 --> 02:35:10.938]  So this is a program that allows that.
[02:35:11.258 --> 02:35:14.658]  There's another one called the Interstate System Construction Toll Pilot Program.
[02:35:15.459 --> 02:35:20.760]  And that authorizes tolling existing facilities on the interstate system to fund new facilities, new highways.
[02:35:20.780 --> 02:35:23.841]  So they're going to stick you on what's already there to fund the new stuff.
[02:35:23.881 --> 02:35:24.281]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:35:24.301 --> 02:35:26.361]  They toll the existing road to pay for the NAFTA highways.
[02:35:26.381 --> 02:35:26.821]  Exactly.
[02:35:26.861 --> 02:35:29.962]  And then there's another one called the Value Pricing Pilot Program.
[02:35:29.982 --> 02:35:31.382]  That's the VPP program.
[02:35:31.883 --> 02:35:33.423]  And that allows them to toll...
[02:35:34.230 --> 02:35:40.995]  Existing toll-free facilities like the high-occupancy vehicle lanes like they have in Houston, they're going to toll them.
[02:35:41.495 --> 02:35:46.518]  And of course, they are going to do it with electronically collected tolls.
[02:35:47.219 --> 02:35:52.242]  And of course, how do you get an electronically collected toll unless you have a toll transponder tag on your car?
[02:35:52.823 --> 02:35:58.827]  Then they've got another one called the Express Lanes Demonstration Program, which allows tolling to finance new lanes.
[02:35:59.207 --> 02:36:03.230]  And on this particular program, automatic toll collection is required.
[02:36:05.020 --> 02:36:16.027]  And the revenue that's collected may be used to provide a reasonable rate of return on private financing, operation, and maintenance costs.
[02:36:16.067 --> 02:36:16.527]  All right.
[02:36:16.807 --> 02:36:18.888]  Just continue, Bob.
[02:36:18.989 --> 02:36:24.552]  So there you've got the private sector coming in here, just like they've been doing in Texas.
[02:36:25.012 --> 02:36:30.896]  And the private sector, if you consider Cintra, the big Spanish consortium, a private sector contractor here,
[02:36:31.543 --> 02:36:32.603]  And it's simple.
[02:36:32.623 --> 02:36:36.424]  They come in, they buy off the politicians, and the politicians just hand the roads over to them.
[02:36:36.444 --> 02:36:40.105]  And you look at the business deals, they say they're not even allowed to know about it because it's a private deal.
[02:36:40.165 --> 02:36:40.905]  It's all secret.
[02:36:41.025 --> 02:36:47.866]  Our road's being handed over to then pay for global government, to pay for the regionalization of the American Union.
[02:36:48.106 --> 02:36:49.886]  We're not supposed to even be involved or know about it.
[02:36:50.226 --> 02:36:52.467]  Well, but I'll tell you who is involved in knowing about it.
[02:36:52.527 --> 02:36:53.727]  Go to this website.
[02:36:53.787 --> 02:36:58.268]  All your listeners go to this website, www.innovativefinance.org.
[02:36:59.321 --> 02:37:08.487]  Now, this website is how they advertise to the state politicos and all the state highway people all the way across the country, begging them to come participate in all these programs.
[02:37:08.527 --> 02:37:10.508]  They have easy-to-fill-out forms.
[02:37:10.528 --> 02:37:11.408]  They tell them what to do.
[02:37:11.428 --> 02:37:12.249]  So that's the payoff.
[02:37:13.430 --> 02:37:19.213]  All the politicos along the roads, they're given special little payoff deals in the infrastructure, and they play ball.
[02:37:19.253 --> 02:37:21.354]  Well, you know, let me just say it.
[02:37:22.435 --> 02:37:28.859]  Two years ago, I looked into the chairman of the House Transportation Committee here in the Texas State Legislature, Mike Krusey.
[02:37:29.319 --> 02:37:32.622]  He's the guy that puts the transportation bills through.
[02:37:32.982 --> 02:37:37.646]  I looked at his campaign contributions for a six-month period.
[02:37:38.026 --> 02:37:42.269]  The man is totally 100% in the pocket of the road construction industry.
[02:37:42.810 --> 02:37:52.797]  The names of the donations, you look it up, these are all presidents of road construction firms, concrete firms, steel firms, and they're giving him maxed-out political contributions, and he's the chairman of the committee.
[02:37:52.897 --> 02:37:54.939]  Now, one plus one equals two?
[02:37:55.769 --> 02:37:57.592]  So here they come with all these bills.
[02:37:58.033 --> 02:37:59.955]  So they buy off Mike Kruse.
[02:38:01.538 --> 02:38:02.599]  They write the bill for him.
[02:38:03.320 --> 02:38:06.545]  A layman cannot write a highway bill like that.
[02:38:06.966 --> 02:38:09.389]  Obviously, the construction companies write the bills for him.
[02:38:09.409 --> 02:38:10.551]  They say, here, put your name on it.
[02:38:11.169 --> 02:38:17.755]  They sneak it to the state legislature, just like they snuck this bill through the federal legislature.
[02:38:18.095 --> 02:38:20.017]  This SAFE-T-E-A-L-U.
[02:38:20.877 --> 02:38:29.965]  This has never been publicized, that they are authorizing the tolling of the interstate system now in order to pay for these new corridors and everything else they want to.
[02:38:30.205 --> 02:38:34.569]  This has never been publicized, but they snuck it through in a big fat bill nobody reads.
[02:38:35.070 --> 02:38:37.592]  And so, at the local level, you have...
[02:38:39.353 --> 02:38:40.733]  People like Mike Kruse doing it.
[02:38:41.114 --> 02:38:42.534]  And at the federal level, I don't know.
[02:38:42.594 --> 02:38:44.395]  Who's responsible for sticking that into the bill?
[02:38:44.415 --> 02:38:44.895]  I don't know.
[02:38:47.075 --> 02:38:49.916]  So basically, it's like America's a giant vending machine.
[02:38:49.936 --> 02:38:52.777]  They put the money in, pull the lever, and what they paid for comes out.
[02:38:53.137 --> 02:38:53.777]  Well, exactly.
[02:38:53.817 --> 02:38:58.318]  And the deal is, you're talking about privatization as part of this.
[02:38:58.699 --> 02:38:59.739]  But this isn't free market.
[02:38:59.759 --> 02:39:03.300]  This is where private interests are handed governmental power in our roads.
[02:39:03.440 --> 02:39:03.780]  Absolutely.
[02:39:03.920 --> 02:39:14.126]  And the other thing is the Constitution is supposed to be in the way of this because the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment was that you can't be taking people's private property except for a public purpose.
[02:39:14.386 --> 02:39:27.874]  And now isn't it convenient that last year the Supreme Court in the Kelo v. City of New London decision made that weird decision nobody could understand and they said, okay, well it's okay now for private individuals to steal other people's property
[02:39:28.574 --> 02:39:36.236]  As long as their use of the property will give a kickback to the government, a higher tax rate, then it's okay.
[02:39:36.256 --> 02:39:46.500]  They openly said in there that city leaders and county leaders and state leaders can decide better and that if private interests want to come openly lobby them to take property they're allowed to.
[02:39:46.540 --> 02:39:51.601]  So it makes criminal activity, robber baron, land baron type activity legal.
[02:39:51.681 --> 02:39:57.303]  And if you're going to build these corridors nationwide all the way throughout the country, you're going to have to steal a lot of property.
[02:39:57.848 --> 02:40:01.590]  So if the Constitution is in the way, well, you're going to have a problem everywhere you go.
[02:40:01.810 --> 02:40:02.410]  So what happens?
[02:40:02.430 --> 02:40:05.011]  The Supreme Court says, hey, it's not a problem anymore.
[02:40:05.412 --> 02:40:07.993]  We're going to force people to sell their land.
[02:40:08.013 --> 02:40:08.953]  We're going to build these quarters.
[02:40:09.213 --> 02:40:12.695]  We're going to turn some of this stuff over to private individuals.
[02:40:12.935 --> 02:40:15.756]  And because we get a kickback, the Supreme Court says it's okay.
[02:40:15.976 --> 02:40:17.397]  Now, that's the big picture.
[02:40:17.637 --> 02:40:20.959]  Well, Bob, I mean, this article you wrote should be ten articles.
[02:40:20.999 --> 02:40:22.360]  I want to thank you for writing it.
[02:40:22.380 --> 02:40:24.962]  You've got all the documents and articles right there.
[02:40:24.982 --> 02:40:34.269]  I mean, just with an email, you discovered from one of these major organizations that it's 80 major trans-American highways.
[02:40:34.309 --> 02:40:36.530]  I mean, this gets worse and worse by the minute.
[02:40:36.550 --> 02:40:37.531]  What else have you discovered?
[02:40:37.851 --> 02:40:38.072]  Well...
[02:40:39.489 --> 02:40:41.250]  I just can't.
[02:40:41.630 --> 02:40:42.370]  There's just too much.
[02:40:42.450 --> 02:40:45.352]  I've got a website here.
[02:40:46.052 --> 02:40:49.373]  Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration.
[02:40:50.674 --> 02:40:54.116]  The topic here is tolling and pricing opportunities.
[02:40:54.856 --> 02:41:01.559]  And they're soliciting the purpose to solicit participation in various programs at ground authority to federal aid facilities.
[02:41:01.979 --> 02:41:06.381]  They are literally advertising this to all the people in the know.
[02:41:07.140 --> 02:41:10.564]  Begging them to come join and get the public-private partnerships.
[02:41:10.624 --> 02:41:14.589]  I think they used to be called fascism, but now it's called public-private partnership.
[02:41:15.230 --> 02:41:20.176]  And it just doesn't stop.
[02:41:20.196 --> 02:41:23.980]  I suppose I could spend more time on this than I even have.
[02:41:24.100 --> 02:41:26.203]  It's like I uncovered this rock.
[02:41:26.974 --> 02:41:29.615]  And there's tons of roaches just running everywhere.
[02:41:29.715 --> 02:41:33.736]  Well, Bob, I know that it's a holiday weekend coming up.
[02:41:33.756 --> 02:41:35.896]  I'm going to be working here some over the weekend on some key issues.
[02:41:36.317 --> 02:41:42.538]  Perhaps you should break down your article and write two or three other addendums to it.
[02:41:43.378 --> 02:41:51.781]  I mean, I would give this article the headline, Total Takeover Plan Discovered, American Union Plan Discovered.
[02:41:51.821 --> 02:41:52.701]  I mean, this is huge.
[02:41:53.516 --> 02:41:58.768]  Yeah, and what's huge about it is, where was the mainstream media when all this was going on?
[02:41:58.828 --> 02:42:01.515]  Where were the American people and the people of Texas included in this?
[02:42:02.037 --> 02:42:07.502]  Yeah, well, you know, as I say in the article, you have to keep the unwashed masses in the dark, Alex.
[02:42:07.902 --> 02:42:19.153]  The cretins, the slobs, the... Because if 97% in major polls are against toll roads and transponders, imagine how many would be against it if they learned it's foreign takeover of America.
[02:42:19.373 --> 02:42:21.135]  I mean, the roads are the infrastructure.
[02:42:21.175 --> 02:42:22.296]  They are the key to the economy.
[02:42:22.656 --> 02:42:23.597]  Yeah, but, you know, the...
[02:42:25.214 --> 02:42:31.598]  What they've tried to do, the strategy was, when the locals start to find out about it, to make them think it's a local issue.
[02:42:32.059 --> 02:42:38.903]  And then when the locals go to their local toll officials, like your friend and mine, Karen Sunlightner, and say, well, why did you vote for the local toll roads?
[02:42:39.604 --> 02:42:40.724]  We said we didn't want it.
[02:42:40.844 --> 02:42:45.127]  They get ignored because it's a done deal already at the federal level.
[02:42:46.608 --> 02:42:50.511]  Well, I want to go back here for just a moment.
[02:42:51.696 --> 02:42:52.116]  Thank you.
[02:42:52.297 --> 02:42:52.797]  Thank you.
[02:42:52.817 --> 02:42:53.197]  Thank you.
[02:43:09.182 --> 02:43:14.746]  They go in, and they have the National Association of Counties, National Association of Governors, National Association of City Managers.
[02:43:14.786 --> 02:43:21.270]  They literally, the lobbyists literally, write up blueprint plans that they then send back to every locale.
[02:43:21.310 --> 02:43:25.353]  They fly your city managers and others up to New York and D.C., lavish meetings.
[02:43:25.413 --> 02:43:31.817]  They give them big payouts, big payoffs, sometimes overt criminal payouts, sometimes delayed kickbacks.
[02:43:32.278 --> 02:43:33.438]  All of this is going on.
[02:43:33.658 --> 02:43:34.879]  All of this is happening.
[02:43:35.500 --> 02:43:37.921]  And then they come back to the local level and implement it.
[02:43:37.941 --> 02:43:39.002]  And I've seen this a hundred times.
[02:43:39.923 --> 02:43:47.528]  The exact thing being put in in Texas is being put in in Minnesota, is being put in in California, is being put in in Indiana.
[02:43:47.889 --> 02:43:50.591]  The same companies, the same players, the same people.
[02:43:50.831 --> 02:43:51.411]  And then you're right.
[02:43:51.431 --> 02:43:56.455]  By the time you hear about it, oh, it's a local idea that our mayor had to raise money for the children.
[02:43:57.015 --> 02:44:02.739]  Yeah, and from the get-go, it was federal, it was international, from the very beginning.
[02:44:03.339 --> 02:44:10.524]  Again, if you don't believe it, just go read the CFR document, Building a North American Community.
[02:44:10.564 --> 02:44:25.713]  I mean, they sit there and they say, hey, listen, we're going to make everybody be able to travel freely all the way across up to Canada, down to Mexico, and of course, the English translation of that, we still speak English, I guess, the English translation of that is 50 million Mexicans move north, you know?
[02:44:27.162 --> 02:44:35.238]  The middle class gets clobbered and wages are driven down even more and the border is dissolved and the United States of America can just kiss itself goodbye.
[02:44:36.135 --> 02:44:38.216]  And folks, they've said they're getting rid of America.
[02:44:38.296 --> 02:44:40.276]  That is the plan, to get rid of the United States.
[02:44:41.037 --> 02:44:43.257]  The Europeans, the same thing happened to them.
[02:44:43.297 --> 02:44:44.958]  They've now rejected EU expansion.
[02:44:45.378 --> 02:44:46.759]  Latin America is pulling out.
[02:44:46.779 --> 02:44:48.019]  So they're having a lot of setbacks.
[02:44:48.419 --> 02:44:51.400]  But here in the United States, their program is on schedule.
[02:44:52.121 --> 02:44:53.741]  Bob Dacey, how do we defeat this?
[02:44:53.781 --> 02:44:55.042]  How do we stop this program?
[02:44:55.062 --> 02:44:59.223]  I mean, obviously, exposing an education, what we're doing now, but other ideas you've got.
[02:44:59.443 --> 02:45:03.468]  Well, you know, the classic example, you have to attack it at every level.
[02:45:03.488 --> 02:45:08.433]  You have to attack it at the local level, the state level, the federal level, every single level.
[02:45:08.653 --> 02:45:16.722]  Here in Austin, of course, the classic example, you've got Sal Costello of Texas Toll Party and David Stahl of CorridorWatch.org.
[02:45:19.858 --> 02:45:21.340]  Promoting this or letting everybody know.
[02:45:21.380 --> 02:45:24.643]  And look what happened to Karen Sunlightner in the last primary election.
[02:45:25.104 --> 02:45:31.310]  She was a 10-year county commissioner who voted for the local tolls against the will of the people of the area.
[02:45:31.711 --> 02:45:37.417]  And in a primary, not even in the election, she got blown away by a newcomer because of the tolls.
[02:45:37.777 --> 02:45:40.320]  And she'd been caught clearly stealing elections before.
[02:45:40.340 --> 02:45:41.862]  Remember back in 98, that was a big...
[02:45:42.743 --> 02:45:46.147]  ...scandal and the ballot box stuffing and the county clerk got caught.
[02:45:46.488 --> 02:45:50.773]  That's why they're racing to put in the electronic voting machines where they can engage in fraud.
[02:45:50.793 --> 02:45:56.040]  But the problem is now we're doing exit polls, watching them very closely, and our people are winning by six landslides.
[02:45:56.341 --> 02:45:59.305]  It's hard for them to do it, though clearly, Bob, there is election fraud going on.
[02:45:59.884 --> 02:46:01.625]  Well, you know, it's funny you should mention that.
[02:46:01.945 --> 02:46:02.806]  This is an aside.
[02:46:02.826 --> 02:46:08.690]  I was at the Greg Palast talk a couple of weeks ago at the Unitarian Church here in Austin.
[02:46:08.710 --> 02:46:08.990]  Yes.
[02:46:09.370 --> 02:46:14.334]  And guess who should come sit right in front of me but Dana de Beauvoir, the Travis County Clerk.
[02:46:14.794 --> 02:46:15.835]  She sat right in front of me.
[02:46:16.855 --> 02:46:18.536]  I reintroduced myself to her.
[02:46:18.576 --> 02:46:21.737]  I reminded her that she was on my TV show a couple of years ago.
[02:46:22.358 --> 02:46:38.704]  I asked her that hypothetical question about what would happen if you had an election where the people who own the voting machines that are being used in a particular area also are contributing massive money to one candidate's campaign.
[02:46:39.385 --> 02:46:39.985]  What about that?
[02:46:40.658 --> 02:46:47.821]  And she said, that is an absolute conflict of interest, and Travis County does not do business with a company that would do that.
[02:46:48.121 --> 02:46:56.205]  And then I proceeded to let her know that 60%, at least, of the investors in the voting machine company were doing exactly that.
[02:46:56.225 --> 02:46:59.086]  It was on their own website.
[02:46:59.286 --> 02:47:02.087]  They listed the investors of Heart Inner Civic.
[02:47:02.971 --> 02:47:18.184]  And I looked up the names, and then I went to the Federal Election Commission and looked up the campaign contributions to Michael McCaul's candidacy for the 10th Congressional District here in Texas, and sure enough, they were funding him with maximum contributions.
[02:47:19.238 --> 02:47:21.538]  Well, Bob, it's even worse than that.
[02:47:21.699 --> 02:47:23.279]  I mean, it's a lot worse than that.
[02:47:23.979 --> 02:47:37.202]  Up in Nebraska, Senator Hagel was going to lose by 15 points, but he literally owns the controlling interest in the voting machine company up there, and then he wins by a 15% landslide, a 30% difference than the polls.
[02:47:37.522 --> 02:47:39.562]  In the past, we never saw these type of events happen.
[02:47:39.902 --> 02:47:42.883]  Now we're seeing things that don't follow common sense.
[02:47:43.423 --> 02:47:48.184]  I reminded Travis County Clerk Dan Dubois of my interview with her two years ago,
[02:47:48.844 --> 02:47:49.785]  I mean, it's publicly admitted.
[02:48:07.777 --> 02:48:26.222]  It's publicly admitted that the owner of Clear Channel, who Michael McCall's married to his daughter, was his biggest political contributor, and that they own the controlling stock in the voting machine company, that over 80% of the three counties here, Williamson, Travis, and Hayes, people cast their votes on those machines.
[02:48:26.242 --> 02:48:26.922]  I mean, what is she saying?
[02:48:26.942 --> 02:48:28.223]  She found no evidence.
[02:48:29.743 --> 02:48:34.484]  Well, she said that because they gave the contributions privately, not through their companies.
[02:48:34.504 --> 02:48:36.085]  Of course, it's illegal to give them through companies.
[02:48:36.593 --> 02:48:38.136]  That's a nice sketch 22, isn't it?
[02:48:38.718 --> 02:48:39.018]  It is.
[02:48:39.098 --> 02:48:43.247]  We'll be right back with a final segment with Bob Daisy talking about the American Union.
[02:48:44.542 --> 02:48:47.363]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:47.643 --> 02:48:49.204]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:49.564 --> 02:48:54.226]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:54.566 --> 02:48:58.988]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:48:59.428 --> 02:49:03.630]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:03.830 --> 02:49:06.671]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:06.751 --> 02:49:09.232]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[02:49:09.452 --> 02:49:16.017]  With the roots and history of its orchestrators, Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:16.257 --> 02:49:23.482]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:23.742 --> 02:49:26.164]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[02:49:47.896 --> 02:49:53.341]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:49:53.621 --> 02:50:03.991]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:50:04.171 --> 02:50:08.495]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:50:08.675 --> 02:50:17.037]  Trihalomethane and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[02:50:17.317 --> 02:50:23.679]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[02:50:23.779 --> 02:50:28.260]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.

[02:51:15.993 --> 02:51:16.393]  We're good to go.
[02:51:43.767 --> 02:51:45.950]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:51:46.531 --> 02:51:49.294]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:50.837 --> 02:52:01.822]  Not only is this NAFTA, American Union, Superhighway, toll control grid, surveillance system, one of the hottest stories right now, rarely is the hottest story also one of the most important.
[02:52:02.242 --> 02:52:03.903]  So Bob, I want to commend you for writing this article.
[02:52:03.923 --> 02:52:09.926]  I hope people will go to Infowars.com and get it and get it out to everybody and make it a big story so millions read it.
[02:52:10.006 --> 02:52:14.328]  Hundreds of thousands read every article we do, but the big ones get millions and millions of readers.
[02:52:15.183 --> 02:52:15.924]  It is so important.
[02:52:15.944 --> 02:52:20.089]  And Bob, I'd like you to just maybe just focus in on two or three of these key areas.
[02:52:20.330 --> 02:52:22.552]  The 80 additional NAFTA highways you discovered.
[02:52:22.893 --> 02:52:23.834]  Some of your other documents.
[02:52:23.854 --> 02:52:27.278]  I want to get these scanned into the web or send those emails over to my people.
[02:52:27.819 --> 02:52:29.942]  And we will get it posted.
[02:52:30.831 --> 02:52:35.853]  With all those emails and correspondence and documents and websites and places you discovered.
[02:52:36.153 --> 02:52:37.714]  Citizens, you can all do this too.
[02:52:38.274 --> 02:52:39.634]  We're all working feverishly.
[02:52:39.834 --> 02:52:42.275]  There's so much evil and corruption, so much proof.
[02:52:42.556 --> 02:52:45.157]  We're like grounding in it, trying to get the word out.
[02:52:45.417 --> 02:52:48.618]  And yes, ladies and gentlemen, visit Infowars.com.

[02:53:46.560 --> 02:53:53.745]  Bob, I appreciate your sacrifice with your family and with your business, the Hardware Store Incorporated in North Austin, where you also sell my videos.
[02:53:54.025 --> 02:53:56.246]  I appreciate all your sacrifice to get this word out.
[02:53:56.587 --> 02:53:58.748]  I hate to put more on you, but you know this is important.
[02:53:58.968 --> 02:54:01.490]  Will you give us more detailed reports on some of these subsections?
[02:54:01.810 --> 02:54:03.211]  As I got the time, I'll do it, Alex.
[02:54:03.231 --> 02:54:05.773]  You know, we're talking about the information war.
[02:54:05.793 --> 02:54:07.614]  You know, you've got Infowars.com.
[02:54:08.335 --> 02:54:09.556]  You're an information warrior.
[02:54:09.796 --> 02:54:16.941]  And the whole point of me coming on this show today is you have the biggest mouth of anybody that I know.
[02:54:17.061 --> 02:54:20.724]  You've got the biggest listening audience in the whole Patriot community.
[02:54:21.664 --> 02:54:24.385]  I really appreciate the short notice.
[02:54:45.191 --> 02:54:55.933]  I mean, I just dumped this story in your lap a couple hours ago, and here I am sitting live in studio with you, and we're broadcasting it all over the world, and that is exciting.
[02:54:56.313 --> 02:54:56.994]  That is exciting.
[02:54:57.034 --> 02:55:03.355]  Well, you did a fabulous job putting this together last week, writing it up, and again, there's just so many bombshells.
[02:55:03.375 --> 02:55:12.457]  These documents that you have that I was reading over during the breaks, these admissions, the incredible part is the people running these governmental organizations and non-governmental organizations...
[02:55:12.737 --> 02:55:14.078]  They just think all this is normal.
[02:55:14.158 --> 02:55:14.778]  Oh, it's secret.
[02:55:14.798 --> 02:55:17.180]  We're not going to tell you, but we will tell you a little bit.
[02:55:17.220 --> 02:55:19.281]  And yes, you're not allowed to have any input.
[02:55:19.301 --> 02:55:20.942]  And yes, we're taking over all your roads.
[02:55:21.002 --> 02:55:22.343]  And yes, we're going to tax you.
[02:55:22.383 --> 02:55:24.084]  And yes, it's going to be run by foreign governments.
[02:55:24.204 --> 02:55:30.787]  Well, all you have to do nowadays in order to make something, you know, turn a sow's ear into a silk purse is give it a good name.
[02:55:31.148 --> 02:55:34.149]  Fascism is now public-private partnership.
[02:55:34.390 --> 02:55:35.110]  It's a good thing now.
[02:55:35.350 --> 02:55:36.811]  And a lot of people, they believe it.
[02:55:38.118 --> 02:55:39.899]  And it's not free market.
[02:55:40.319 --> 02:55:40.839]  No, it's not.
[02:55:42.380 --> 02:55:43.801]  The selected groups get in on it.
[02:55:44.181 --> 02:55:52.305]  I mean, if a politician gets paid off and then decides to hand the private interest to your houses or your cars or your children, that isn't free market.
[02:55:52.345 --> 02:55:53.185]  It's called piracy.
[02:55:53.225 --> 02:55:54.766]  It's called piratical robbery.
[02:55:55.402 --> 02:56:01.424]  Yeah, and we are the sheep getting shorn, the cows to be milked, whatever you want to call it.
[02:56:01.984 --> 02:56:03.105]  It's all at our expense.
[02:56:03.285 --> 02:56:04.205]  Bob Dacey, we're out of time.
[02:56:04.245 --> 02:56:05.245]  I want to thank you for joining us.
[02:56:05.365 --> 02:56:05.845]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:56:05.865 --> 02:56:09.287]  You're a good friend of mine, and I appreciate the fine research and work you do.
[02:56:09.347 --> 02:56:10.107]  It's exemplary.
[02:56:10.427 --> 02:56:11.387]  It's top of the line.
[02:56:11.787 --> 02:56:15.509]  And what you write and you put out can be verified and can be trusted.
[02:56:15.689 --> 02:56:17.029]  So God bless you, Bob Dacey.
[02:56:17.069 --> 02:56:17.629]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:56:18.070 --> 02:56:18.410]  You bet.
[02:56:18.670 --> 02:56:19.430]  We're out of time.
[02:56:19.950 --> 02:56:20.870]  We'll see you back next week.
