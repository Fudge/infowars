[00:00:05.551 --> 00:00:06.211]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.872 --> 00:00:07.913]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:09.734]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:11.195]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.956 --> 00:00:12.877]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.537 --> 00:00:17.321]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.721 --> 00:00:21.804]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.412 --> 00:00:33.053]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:33.093 --> 00:00:34.854]  It's the 17th day of March 2006 on this Live Friday edition.
[00:00:34.874 --> 00:00:35.895]  And we're going to have open phones today.
[00:00:35.915 --> 00:00:41.540]  Wide open phones with a full three hours, any news issue, any item, any story.
[00:00:59.196 --> 00:01:00.957]  Any solutions you wish to discuss?
[00:01:01.017 --> 00:01:01.877]  Any questions?
[00:01:01.937 --> 00:01:02.578]  Any comments?
[00:01:02.598 --> 00:01:03.318]  You disagree with me?
[00:01:03.838 --> 00:01:04.338]  Whatever!
[00:01:04.358 --> 00:01:05.719]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:05.839 --> 00:01:14.383]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and this is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:01:15.723 --> 00:01:24.347]  And the websites, freshly updated multiple times daily for you are InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv,
[00:01:25.823 --> 00:01:27.926]  And now JonesReport.com.
[00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:32.532]  I've had that site up and running for about five years, but only updated it about once a year.
[00:01:32.552 --> 00:01:36.096]  Kind of a little stagnant site sitting up there orbiting.
[00:01:37.117 --> 00:01:44.607]  We are now updating it daily, and it's got a lot of key data areas on mercury in the vaccines and
[00:01:45.622 --> 00:01:50.986]  On government-sponsored terror, and on fluoride, and on aspartame, and key issues like that.
[00:01:51.026 --> 00:01:54.629]  And the site's going to become more and more a 9-11 archive.
[00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.393]  More up to speed on some of the stuff on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:01.655]  And so we're proud of JonesReport.com.
[00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:05.317]  Be sure and check it out.
[00:02:05.838 --> 00:02:07.439]  Again, that toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:08.580]  There is so much news here today to cover.
[00:02:16.751 --> 00:02:24.688]  So much happening, but I frankly can't get over the article yesterday and I made some phone calls to Congress and confirmed it that President Bush signed a budget bill.
[00:02:26.926 --> 00:02:28.267]  That hadn't even been passed.
[00:02:28.287 --> 00:02:32.251]  There were different versions, and Dennis Hatchard let them know that, hey, you're about to sign the wrong bill.
[00:02:32.732 --> 00:02:34.854]  Bush has said, well, this one's got two billion more in pork.
[00:02:34.894 --> 00:02:35.294]  I like it.
[00:02:35.314 --> 00:02:36.175]  I'll just sign this one.
[00:02:36.475 --> 00:02:37.096]  Never passed.
[00:02:37.136 --> 00:02:45.904]  I mean, he studies above the law, you know, if they didn't, quote, reauthorize the Patriot Act, which they did, but if they didn't, he said, I'll just enforce it without having a law.
[00:02:46.485 --> 00:02:48.907]  And he said, I have these signing statements when I sign bills.
[00:02:49.007 --> 00:02:50.289]  I say what we're really going to do with them.
[00:02:51.101 --> 00:02:56.385]  He said that I don't care if it's a federal law against wiretapping and spying on the American people without warrants.
[00:02:56.805 --> 00:02:57.286]  I'll do it.
[00:02:58.046 --> 00:02:59.868]  And I'll torture kids if I want.
[00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:01.029]  You know, that's Christian.
[00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.172]  And then now, oh, I'll just sign bills that haven't passed.
[00:03:05.252 --> 00:03:08.915]  The level of lawlessness
[00:03:10.993 --> 00:03:14.754]  In fact, I'd like to hear your examples of lawlessness by government, period.
[00:03:15.154 --> 00:03:16.115]  That's what tyranny is.
[00:03:16.155 --> 00:03:17.555]  It's a lawless government.
[00:03:17.595 --> 00:03:28.179]  It's a government out of control, a government of force, a government of the oligarchy, of the dictator, of the plutocracy, of the aristocracy, whatever elite it is.
[00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:30.439]  The toll-free number to join us again, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:35.981]  Here are the top reports I have in front of me today.
[00:03:36.001 --> 00:03:38.762]  Senate votes to raise the debt limit.
[00:03:40.985 --> 00:03:49.307]  And of course, now up to around $9 trillion, another $781 billion on top of the $8 plus trillion.
[00:03:49.387 --> 00:03:51.648]  And then you can read the Dallas Morning News a few years ago.
[00:03:51.688 --> 00:04:03.431]  They admitted that our real expenditures, our real programs that we signed on to, that the government owes on, was $44 trillion.
[00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:06.012]  And then a lot of other economists looked at that and said, no, it's really $65 trillion.
[00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:16.825]  And then now today, you look at those numbers, and chief economists and top experts from inside out of the government are saying that it's more like 87 trillion.
[00:04:18.226 --> 00:04:21.167]  Trillion here, trillion there, pretty soon you're talking about some real money.
[00:04:22.848 --> 00:04:24.168]  Even with the devalued dollar.
[00:04:25.769 --> 00:04:28.410]  So, it's serious.
[00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:32.732]  It's very, very serious.
[00:04:36.065 --> 00:04:41.187]  If the commitments, if the debts they've signed on to are 80 plus trillion.
[00:04:42.608 --> 00:04:45.670]  Everybody's freaking out over 9 trillion.
[00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.971]  See, 9 trillion's due right now.
[00:04:50.392 --> 00:04:51.532]  9 trillion's due today.
[00:04:53.554 --> 00:04:58.256]  But on the note, we owe 87 trillion to the Rothschilds.
[00:05:01.323 --> 00:05:08.167]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:05:08.467 --> 00:05:09.848]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:05:10.028 --> 00:05:12.229]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:14.490]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.693]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:20.033 --> 00:05:24.055]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:05:24.315 --> 00:05:26.096]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:05:26.156 --> 00:05:36.800]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.860]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.942]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns in the info war.
[00:05:43.022 --> 00:05:44.442]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[00:05:44.482 --> 00:05:44.683]  That's 888-2533-139.

[00:05:55.372 --> 00:05:56.073]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:06:02.182 --> 00:06:06.686]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:06:07.046 --> 00:06:11.129]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.970]  We listened.
[00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:17.275]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:06:17.535 --> 00:06:18.035]  We listened.
[00:06:18.416 --> 00:06:21.458]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:06:21.878 --> 00:06:22.399]  We listened.
[00:06:22.859 --> 00:06:26.922]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:06:27.302 --> 00:06:27.802]  We listened.
[00:06:28.143 --> 00:06:33.366]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:06:33.786 --> 00:06:35.147]  Again, we listened.
[00:06:35.507 --> 00:06:42.892]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:06:43.272 --> 00:06:46.735]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling

[00:06:57.235 --> 00:06:58.656]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:01.178 --> 00:07:08.063]  For months now you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[00:07:08.203 --> 00:07:21.133]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[00:07:21.314 --> 00:07:21.834]  Are you sick of
[00:07:21.834 --> 00:07:23.095]  Are you barely having enough money?
[00:07:23.255 --> 00:07:26.738]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[00:07:26.998 --> 00:07:30.782]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[00:07:31.042 --> 00:07:36.006]  Whatever it is you seek, Dango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[00:07:36.286 --> 00:07:37.988]  So take matters into your own hands.
[00:07:38.268 --> 00:07:42.231]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[00:07:42.491 --> 00:07:44.333]  Dango is what you are looking for.

[00:07:50.618 --> 00:07:51.420]  We're good to go.
[00:08:01.101 --> 00:08:06.143]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.503 --> 00:08:08.825]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:09.205 --> 00:08:27.153]  Organized crime has taken over the federal government, most state governments, and many local governments.
[00:08:28.093 --> 00:08:29.714]  But it's more corrupt at the federal level.
[00:08:31.383 --> 00:08:48.602]  on average in the aggregate and they own and control and finance gigantic high-tech public relations firms to convince you that they're the establishment and that they are legitimate and that everything's okay and just submit to them and everything will be alright.
[00:08:49.283 --> 00:08:52.106]  Everything isn't going to be alright going along with these individuals.
[00:08:53.510 --> 00:09:02.615]  And this whole criminal system continues to operate because there's so many good people within the system who are in denial and lie to themselves about what they're involved in every day.
[00:09:03.776 --> 00:09:06.897]  About what they're helping to carry out.
[00:09:08.878 --> 00:09:17.183]  There is a systematic looting going on in every sector of the economy, federal, state, local, private, corporate.
[00:09:18.884 --> 00:09:23.006]  There is a just mad rush to gut
[00:09:24.048 --> 00:09:41.239]  Every major institution and trust fund, in fact, they're already gutting most of the trust funds, but then still, via the Ponzi scheme, paying out for now to many people, just like Enron had gutted itself two years before they finally pulled the plug on it.
[00:09:42.219 --> 00:09:42.920]  Remember Enron?
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:45.882]  They had fake energy trading boards up in
[00:09:47.296 --> 00:09:50.860]  Up in Sacramento and they would walk members of the U.S.
[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:56.365]  Congress and of course the California Legislature through with fake computers, fake computer programs showing them the energy trading.
[00:09:56.986 --> 00:10:00.709]  There was no energy trading even going on using actual computers.
[00:10:00.749 --> 00:10:06.455]  They would just tell people what it cost and then tell California there's no power, we've got to triple your prices this month.
[00:10:07.416 --> 00:10:08.136]  Remember all that?
[00:10:08.176 --> 00:10:09.678]  And it turned out that was all a big scam!
[00:10:12.692 --> 00:10:25.219]  And things are so corrupt that Arnold Schwarzenegger was the one involved meeting with Michael Milken, the junk bond convicted scammer, and Ken Lay and others, and then he went after Gray Davis, saying Gray Davis was involved when Gray Davis wasn't involved.
[00:10:25.819 --> 00:10:36.205]  And so really, Schwarzenegger being put in was more about the cover-up of that than even getting rid of the evil liberal Gray Davis when Bill Clinton and
[00:10:37.205 --> 00:10:43.510]  Gray Davis and others have always been in the hip pocket of the neocons, and Arnold Schwarzenegger has out Gray Davis Gray Davis.
[00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:44.631]  I'm no fan of Gray Davis.
[00:10:44.651 --> 00:10:50.355]  I don't know why I'm starting the broadcast with comments on that today.
[00:10:50.375 --> 00:10:54.118]  It's just there's another microcosm of how ridiculous all of this is.
[00:10:54.879 --> 00:10:55.359]  It's fake.
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.161]  The Chicago mercantile is fake.
[00:10:59.202 --> 00:11:01.304]  Much of the New York Stock Exchange is fake.
[00:11:03.605 --> 00:11:04.186]  It's a joke.
[00:11:07.313 --> 00:11:10.635]  Almost our entire world now is a hoax.
[00:11:12.197 --> 00:11:15.999]  What we're told, what goes on, it's just most of it is a hoax.
[00:11:17.901 --> 00:11:33.452]  And an example of this is Bush, we now learn a couple weeks ago, signed a spending bill that was hundreds of billions of dollars and two billion of it that he wanted was not passed and so he just went and got an earlier version of the bill that never passed
[00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:39.355]  And signed that, and we've now learned that he was told that, sir, you're signing a bill that wasn't passed.
[00:11:40.075 --> 00:11:41.897]  The Speaker of the House told him this in a letter.
[00:11:42.378 --> 00:11:45.521]  They just signed it, knowing we're so dumb, they can take two billion bucks!
[00:11:45.981 --> 00:11:48.784]  Right in front of everybody, and she says, oh well, two billion, that's what they did.
[00:11:53.349 --> 00:11:58.614]  So, so now the stealing, now the looting, now the, the, the craziness.
[00:11:59.548 --> 00:12:04.350]  Has gotten so wild that I can't even imagine what's going to be next.
[00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:06.571]  I mean, here's another microcosm example.
[00:12:08.953 --> 00:12:14.976]  Halliburton is a thoroughly corrupt and nightmarish company with hundreds of subsidiaries, over 120 subsidiaries.
[00:12:18.143 --> 00:12:18.763]  And more every day.
[00:12:18.803 --> 00:12:24.207]  There's going to be a front now for the Dubai Ports World and for the UAE, taking over 21 ports.
[00:12:24.287 --> 00:12:28.149]  And then the UAE executive is still going to be the head of all maritime activities.
[00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:33.353]  Maritime administration running security for the entire nation's ports and waterways and intercoastal canals.
[00:12:35.314 --> 00:12:37.796]  But I digress.
[00:12:38.136 --> 00:12:39.157]  Halliburton in Iraq.
[00:12:39.517 --> 00:12:42.178]  People are sending me emails going, hey look, it's in the Associated Press, it's in the news.
[00:12:43.039 --> 00:12:45.861]  Halliburton sent water, totally untreated,
[00:12:49.573 --> 00:12:51.895]  And they truck it up from Kuwait.
[00:12:52.436 --> 00:12:55.178]  And why do they truck it up from Kuwait untreated?
[00:12:55.198 --> 00:12:56.519]  Because that would cost money if it was treated.
[00:12:56.539 --> 00:12:57.199]  A little bit of money.
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:03.564]  And then they charge tens of thousands of dollars per truck of water.
[00:13:04.685 --> 00:13:08.608]  And then the provisional authority will not get the water treatment plants back up and running.
[00:13:08.808 --> 00:13:10.770]  They've made no attempts to even get them up.
[00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:12.071]  It can be done in just a few days.
[00:13:12.131 --> 00:13:15.073]  Top generals have said, and they're always removed and new ones put in.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.740]  So why are they doing that?
[00:13:18.981 --> 00:13:28.429]  Because if they have to truck the water in, can you imagine the business of trucking all the water in, not just the fuel in, for the troops in Iraq?
[00:13:28.449 --> 00:13:38.818]  Can you imagine how much money that is for the 60,000 contractors and the 150,000 troops and the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi National Guard?
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.263]  And then all the other functionaries and the six big armored compounds.
[00:13:43.303 --> 00:13:44.764]  They're going to build, what, 21 total.
[00:13:44.784 --> 00:13:48.448]  But right now, six big armored compounds that the Globalists have built.
[00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.091]  I mean, that's why they do it.
[00:13:53.012 --> 00:13:57.055]  They truck in the water, because they'll get a bigger profit if they truck it in.
[00:13:57.456 --> 00:13:58.997]  And so Halliburton gets that profit.
[00:13:59.357 --> 00:14:00.979]  They don't give water filters to the troops.
[00:14:01.019 --> 00:14:03.281]  They don't set up the water treatment plants again.
[00:14:03.741 --> 00:14:04.302]  The troops got to
[00:14:05.297 --> 00:14:12.419]  And there's big articles about how it's totally toxic, filled with all sorts of chemicals and microbes and amoebas and the troops are all getting sick.
[00:14:12.839 --> 00:14:14.160]  It even destroys the war effort.
[00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:15.000]  They just don't care.
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.120]  There's no oversight.
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.341]  No one questions them.
[00:14:17.681 --> 00:14:18.621]  No one says anything.
[00:14:18.661 --> 00:14:20.762]  And the corporation looks at the total bottom line.
[00:14:22.142 --> 00:14:29.385]  So, I mean, imagine a whole water policy built around just making sure Halliburton can truck water in at ridiculous prices.
[00:14:31.125 --> 00:14:34.146]  Another example is, Halliburton has the monopoly on laundry.
[00:14:35.706 --> 00:14:37.427]  And, uh, I forget what the news was.
[00:14:37.467 --> 00:14:38.588]  It was about a year ago.
[00:14:38.608 --> 00:14:38.868]  What is it?
[00:14:38.888 --> 00:14:40.169]  10 pounds of laundry is over $100.
[00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:47.334]  But they make the troops, every week or so, you know, get in their dress uniforms and line up for inspection.
[00:14:47.354 --> 00:14:49.916]  So they've got to go pay Alliburton to launder the clothes.
[00:14:50.116 --> 00:14:51.097]  It's just another example.
[00:14:51.718 --> 00:15:04.284]  Somebody gets shattered by a rocket-propelled grenade, an RPG, and then they cut the body armor off of them in a field hospital with holes all over their bodies, little shattered bodies, these troops, and, oh, we're gonna charge you 800 bucks for that body armor.
[00:15:04.464 --> 00:15:05.765]  It's level 2 crud.
[00:15:06.085 --> 00:15:08.206]  Defective for even level 2, not even really level 1.
[00:15:08.386 --> 00:15:14.609]  We're gonna charge you 4 or 5 times what a level 2 vest really costs, brand new.
[00:15:15.109 --> 00:15:16.790]  As if anyone even uses level 2 now.
[00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:19.431]  I mean, it's like, Vietnam-era stuff's better.
[00:15:22.012 --> 00:15:23.934]  So, and that's all admitted.
[00:15:26.256 --> 00:15:42.489]  So, I mean, there's an example just of the wild corruption, and now it's in the news that the water is so toxic, and then there's the tigers and the Euphrates right there in Baghdad, and they can take it right out, and the military even has water treatment vehicles, but they won't even let our troops use those.
[00:15:42.689 --> 00:15:44.030]  You've got to drink Albertan water.
[00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:53.241]  And then it's come out how the meals are rotten, how the meals are, some of them left over from Vietnam, how the meals are making everybody sick.
[00:15:56.982 --> 00:16:07.784]  And then when the troops get their arms and legs blown off, they get to pay four dollars a day for their meals in Germany, or in hospitals in Iraq, and then they get to pay for their own flights home.
[00:16:09.404 --> 00:16:12.225]  Imagine getting wheeled onto the jet and
[00:16:14.668 --> 00:16:17.289]  Nobody's really there to help you and both your legs are blown off.
[00:16:20.771 --> 00:16:27.815]  And imagine having to get yourself down to the bathroom at the end of the plane and doing all that and realizing that you're paying for your own flight home.
[00:16:27.855 --> 00:16:29.836]  And that's not urban legend.
[00:16:29.876 --> 00:16:30.436]  That's true.
[00:16:33.137 --> 00:16:38.960]  And then I talked to neocons out at Crawford worshipping Bush and they're just like, they didn't even deny that when I bring that stuff up.
[00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:41.461]  They go, well, we're going to take care of that for you.
[00:16:41.782 --> 00:16:42.502]  Bush knows what he's doing.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.041]  Oh yeah, he does alright.
[00:16:48.462 --> 00:16:50.904]  And those are just little examples.
[00:16:51.304 --> 00:16:55.126]  They're very small compared to other stuff that's going on, like depleted uranium.
[00:16:57.667 --> 00:17:08.253]  It has a half-life, if you can believe this, of 44 billion years.
[00:17:08.313 --> 00:17:10.714]  Just type in half-life of depleted uranium.
[00:17:11.634 --> 00:17:12.915]  In the Google, you can get it.
[00:17:14.987 --> 00:17:18.510]  And it is pure uranium.
[00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:26.416]  It's just had a particular isotope taken out that's used for fuel rods and hydrogen bombs and things of that nature.
[00:17:28.257 --> 00:17:31.059]  X-ray bombs, neutron bombs, lots of goodies.
[00:17:34.382 --> 00:17:39.766]  And so they plate the tanks in it and they serve it out down to even small arms and not just the
[00:17:40.717 --> 00:17:43.598]  Warthogs and Abrams tanks, now everybody's got it.
[00:17:43.938 --> 00:17:49.080]  And they're running around using it, and they're living in the areas where it's being used, and the radiation detectors go off.
[00:17:52.562 --> 00:18:05.687]  And so what happens, Halliburton goes in, in England and other areas, and buys, this is Times of London, this is Financial Times, this is BBC, this is Associated Press, and goes and buys the detectors and says those are private now,
[00:18:07.292 --> 00:18:08.753]  We're not going to let you know those numbers.
[00:18:09.573 --> 00:18:26.381]  I got another one here today, Associated Press, where they're going to cut back from testing what is like one in a hundred cows, it says, to testing even less cows for CJD, known as Mad Cow, Creutzfeldt-Jacobs, prions, whatever they're called.
[00:18:28.061 --> 00:18:29.622]  So it's just like in Iraq.
[00:18:29.662 --> 00:18:31.523]  Day one, they take over three years ago, they go,
[00:18:32.432 --> 00:18:37.655]  Globalists, they go, we're not going to keep the numbers of cancer, death, infant mortality, no more official statistics!
[00:18:38.616 --> 00:18:40.036]  Let the murder begin!
[00:18:41.477 --> 00:18:42.718]  Well, it's the same thing over here.
[00:18:43.498 --> 00:18:52.444]  Did you know in the last two years, CNN has reported this, this is CDC's own numbers, lung cancer is up six times.
[00:18:52.464 --> 00:18:53.524]  It was already an epidemic.
[00:18:55.265 --> 00:18:58.267]  It's like everything else is up many times.
[00:19:02.239 --> 00:19:07.701]  And, uh, and they got little stupid stories how it's about radon and it's cigarettes that did it.
[00:19:07.761 --> 00:19:08.421]  Uh-huh, sure.
[00:19:08.882 --> 00:19:10.202]  Less cigarettes, less, you know.
[00:19:10.502 --> 00:19:12.143]  But, oh, that's what's causing it, magically.
[00:19:14.023 --> 00:19:15.044]  Secondhand smoke did it.
[00:19:15.084 --> 00:19:15.984]  Yes, yes, that's it.
[00:19:17.865 --> 00:19:20.266]  And we're sitting here, right now, breathing this.
[00:19:20.346 --> 00:19:26.828]  And these lunatics, George Bush's daughters, are breathing it.
[00:19:26.868 --> 00:19:28.009]  Neocons are breathing it.
[00:19:28.049 --> 00:19:29.129]  Their babies are breathing it.
[00:19:30.422 --> 00:19:33.525]  All these good ol' boys that just said, nuke them, turn them into a glass parking lot.
[00:19:33.565 --> 00:19:36.107]  No, they turn them into a dirty bomb parking lot.
[00:19:36.507 --> 00:19:38.869]  Our government has bombed us with dirty bombs.
[00:19:39.469 --> 00:19:40.690]  The stuff blows all over the world.
[00:19:42.331 --> 00:19:45.294]  They've used it for 30 years.
[00:19:46.715 --> 00:19:47.776]  All over the U.S.
[00:19:47.856 --> 00:19:49.057]  in 10 Proving Grounds plus.
[00:19:49.137 --> 00:19:51.418]  Now I've been corrected, there's many more, but 10 big ones.
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:57.403]  And they're just... They're not going to stop.
[00:19:57.423 --> 00:19:58.404]  They're accelerating.
[00:20:02.725 --> 00:20:05.066]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:20:05.086 --> 00:20:12.348]  Did you know that an FBI agent assigned to the White House when Bill Clinton took office wrote a book entitled Unlimited Access?
[00:20:13.088 --> 00:20:20.051]  He told of Clinton's staff coming into the White House its first day with red buttons on their shirt with a picture of the first communist dictator, B.I.
[00:20:20.511 --> 00:20:21.151]  Lenin, on them.
[00:20:22.034 --> 00:20:26.717]  Is it any wonder the United States government moved further to the left during the Clinton administration?
[00:20:27.317 --> 00:20:31.299]  Even Hillary tried to pass a socialistic program for health care.
[00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:39.644]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:21:03.502 --> 00:21:04.543]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:04.943 --> 00:21:10.427]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:21:11.007 --> 00:21:11.508]  That's right.
[00:21:11.828 --> 00:21:14.110]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:21.595]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:21:22.153 --> 00:21:29.840]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:35.144]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:21:35.765 --> 00:21:38.187]  If you'd like to take a look at gold pre-retirement,
[00:21:38.527 --> 00:21:40.768]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:41.569 --> 00:21:45.691]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.

[00:21:48.953 --> 00:21:49.233]  That's 1-800-686-2237.

[00:23:01.531 --> 00:23:03.233]  What causes foods to spoil?
[00:23:03.653 --> 00:23:06.636]  All produce produces a natural gas which causes ripening.
[00:23:06.957 --> 00:23:12.242]  In addition, foods like onions and garlic emit odors, causing foods to lose their freshness and flavor.
[00:23:12.542 --> 00:23:22.092]  Now there's Forever Fresh for the fridge, a revolutionary new product proven to eliminate refrigerator odors, and guaranteed to keep produce fresh at least twice as long as normal.
[00:23:22.373 --> 00:23:24.555]  Nancy McKimpson of Jacksonville, Florida says,
[00:23:24.835 --> 00:23:28.398]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, everything stays fresh much longer.
[00:23:28.658 --> 00:23:31.881]  Like strawberries, which now last a couple of weeks instead of just a few days.
[00:23:32.162 --> 00:23:35.705]  Jane Burke of New Jersey says... You know, we eat a lot of salads.
[00:23:35.865 --> 00:23:39.328]  I used to throw out the leftovers because they'd turn brown and they'd shrivel up.
[00:23:39.468 --> 00:23:40.729]  I'm really amazed.
[00:23:40.869 --> 00:23:46.735]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, all my produce stays fresher longer, including the leftovers.
[00:23:46.875 --> 00:23:49.277]  Now I just couldn't get along without Forever Fresh.
[00:23:49.637 --> 00:23:57.763]  To order your Forever Fresh for the fridge, visit the web at foreverfresh.us or call toll-free 1-866-NO-ODERS.

[00:24:02.647 --> 00:24:07.830]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:08.471 --> 00:24:10.752]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:23.251]  I'll tell you what, just go ahead and go to your calls.
[00:24:23.271 --> 00:24:26.092]  Then I'll start plowing through more of the news.
[00:24:28.213 --> 00:24:30.933]  I just am so blown away at the level of lawlessness.
[00:24:32.554 --> 00:24:38.536]  And it's not a good sign when they're increasing it day by day with just total arrogance.
[00:24:39.616 --> 00:24:40.896]  Chad in Iowa.
[00:24:41.277 --> 00:24:42.477]  Go ahead Chad, you're on the air.
[00:24:42.497 --> 00:24:44.097]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[00:24:44.678 --> 00:24:45.818]  Pretty good, I have trouble hearing you.
[00:24:46.158 --> 00:24:47.679]  Okay, I'll try to speak up a little bit.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:57.044]  Like, uh, yesterday when you were talking about the school bombings and stuff on election day, was that gonna be, was that supposed to be here?
[00:24:58.165 --> 00:24:59.726]  No, sir, that was in Belarus.
[00:24:59.906 --> 00:25:02.227]  That's over in the former, uh, eastern block.
[00:25:02.707 --> 00:25:05.689]  Ah, yeah, I was in and out of... It's a Russian backwater.
[00:25:06.249 --> 00:25:06.770]  Oh, okay.
[00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:15.875]  Um, I got some really, really light things to say to you, and I really want to tread kind of lightly because
[00:25:16.437 --> 00:25:28.539]  One thing I have to say, it's gonna come off the wrong way in the first place, but, uh, I, for the longest time, I was just, uh, just a little wiener right in the fence, you know, being misdiagnostic.
[00:25:29.139 --> 00:25:42.442]  In my mind, you know, the atheists were just as silly as the Christians, you know, there's definitely not a God, there definitely is a God, but, kinda, you know, I, I realize this isn't really religious or anything, this show, but this is kinda what I'm getting around to, is,
[00:25:43.854 --> 00:25:51.656]  You know, it's kind of a really horrible statement, and this is where I was going to try to tread real lightly, because I think you can understand without getting offended.
[00:25:51.676 --> 00:25:53.016]  Yeah, you don't have to tread lightly.
[00:25:53.036 --> 00:25:54.136]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:25:54.356 --> 00:26:05.139]  After watching a lot of your documentaries, and there was also an archaeologist, he found Sodom and Gomorrah, and Noah's Ark, and the Ark of the Covenant, and all this stuff.
[00:26:05.899 --> 00:26:10.960]  You know, it kind of really says something that this state of the world that it is right now,
[00:26:11.613 --> 00:26:13.574]  I don't really know any other way to say this.
[00:26:13.834 --> 00:26:16.996]  It's quite appalling, yet kinda cool.
[00:26:17.517 --> 00:26:20.819]  I found Jesus Christ at the bottom of a pile of crap.
[00:26:21.719 --> 00:26:36.648]  I mean, that's just the worst thing to say, but what... What's the quickest way to get a horrible, explosive, violent reaction out of somebody other than to, you know, just in passing, you know, say, you know, oh, well, these are my beliefs and thoughts, or this or that, whatever.
[00:26:36.668 --> 00:26:39.470]  No, no, I understand where you're going, and I appreciate your call.
[00:26:40.905 --> 00:26:46.307]  You know, I don't want to be associated with the big mainline churches and the things they do.
[00:26:46.767 --> 00:26:48.548]  That's not what's in my Bible.
[00:26:50.369 --> 00:26:57.552]  But a lot of people, you know, have found God through adversity, through corruption, through seeing what's happening.
[00:26:58.112 --> 00:26:59.172]  And all I know is this.
[00:27:00.293 --> 00:27:01.654]  The elite believes in God.
[00:27:01.694 --> 00:27:02.554]  They believe in the devil.
[00:27:03.394 --> 00:27:05.515]  The elite believe in it passionately.
[00:27:05.555 --> 00:27:07.676]  They believe they get power from their God.
[00:27:08.783 --> 00:27:10.805]  Now, a lot of atheists say, oh, I don't believe in that.
[00:27:10.845 --> 00:27:11.865]  You're nuts to cover it.
[00:27:11.905 --> 00:27:12.526]  Well, wait a minute.
[00:27:13.046 --> 00:27:28.017]  I mean, even if I was an atheist, which I'm not, shouldn't I cover the fact that Bush engages in his father and his father and on back in the time, engage in weird occult rituals at a place called Skull and Bones and get in coffins, admittedly, and do weird rituals?
[00:27:28.077 --> 00:27:36.783]  I mean, isn't it newsworthy that they go to a place called Bohemian Grove and have revived an ancient Canaanite 3,000-year-old human sacrifice cult?
[00:27:37.811 --> 00:27:38.732]  And engage in it?
[00:27:38.832 --> 00:27:40.594]  I mean, that'd been the rumors I'd heard.
[00:27:40.674 --> 00:27:44.918]  I showed up on the appointed day, snuck in, caught video of it, and they indeed do it!
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:49.382]  And then now we got new footage out of it last year, in 2005.
[00:27:50.223 --> 00:27:54.267]  Inside the owl, the effigies they burn, the things they do.
[00:27:54.967 --> 00:27:58.030]  And then you go research real black magic.
[00:27:58.090 --> 00:27:58.871]  I mean, this is it.
[00:27:59.492 --> 00:28:01.213]  Real black magicians don't
[00:28:03.217 --> 00:28:09.041]  Dress up like Anton LaVey in a devil pajamas and dance around with a plastic pitchfork like it's Halloween.
[00:28:09.481 --> 00:28:10.842]  They think Satan is God.
[00:28:11.702 --> 00:28:16.626]  It's done with a lot of regalia and a lot of pomp and a lot of officialdom.
[00:28:19.407 --> 00:28:22.029]  And they take it deadly serious.
[00:28:22.189 --> 00:28:23.890]  I've been in the crowd with them.
[00:28:25.171 --> 00:28:26.532]  In the church pews with them.
[00:28:27.893 --> 00:28:29.734]  They're in their church under the great trees.
[00:28:30.525 --> 00:28:33.347]  And believe me, those old men were in rapture.
[00:28:33.527 --> 00:28:37.649]  Those old men were crazed.
[00:28:37.769 --> 00:28:41.732]  They were burning with dark power.
[00:28:42.472 --> 00:28:45.074]  And they have power on the earth.
[00:28:45.514 --> 00:28:48.235]  Their God has given them power.
[00:28:50.777 --> 00:28:55.219]  Now you can say that it's a self-fulfilling prophecy and they just chose to believe it and go along with it.
[00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:55.800]  Why?
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:56.120]  Why?
[00:29:00.695 --> 00:29:02.836]  So, there's a lot of things going on.
[00:29:04.777 --> 00:29:06.998]  And I've just gone where the truth leads me.
[00:29:08.459 --> 00:29:09.699]  That's all I've ever done.
[00:29:09.779 --> 00:29:10.900]  That's all I'll ever do.
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:13.140]  That's all I'll ever attempt to do.
[00:29:14.861 --> 00:29:16.962]  And I appreciate your comments, Chad.
[00:29:17.382 --> 00:29:22.824]  Jason, Kathy, Levi, Dave, and others will go right to you when we get back.
[00:29:23.765 --> 00:29:25.886]  Wide open phones on this live Friday edition.
[00:29:25.906 --> 00:29:27.446]  It's been a while since I just had open phones.
[00:29:28.147 --> 00:29:28.967]  We're doing that today.
[00:29:30.055 --> 00:29:31.635]  And covering a lot of news in the meantime.
[00:29:32.636 --> 00:29:34.816]  So you'll want to stay with us.
[00:29:34.836 --> 00:29:35.837]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:29:36.437 --> 00:29:38.797]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:39.058 --> 00:29:41.558]  Blasting out worldwide on the AM, FM dial.
[00:29:42.479 --> 00:29:44.479]  On the internet at infowarriors.com.
[00:29:44.879 --> 00:29:47.680]  And global shortaway via W, WCR.
[00:29:51.721 --> 00:29:52.641]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.101 --> 00:29:54.702]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.722 --> 00:29:58.323]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.897 --> 00:30:06.539]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[00:30:06.579 --> 00:30:07.299]  have diabetes.
[00:30:07.639 --> 00:30:14.582]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[00:30:14.722 --> 00:30:19.264]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[00:30:19.464 --> 00:30:22.285]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.
[00:30:22.425 --> 00:30:29.348]  This is why, as your trusted online partner in health, we are committed to bringing you products that help you make informed decisions about your health.

[00:31:01.509 --> 00:31:09.031]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:31:09.311 --> 00:31:22.255]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require very little energy.
[00:31:22.555 --> 00:31:25.877]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:31:26.217 --> 00:31:36.682]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:31:36.962 --> 00:31:37.462]  That's right!
[00:31:37.642 --> 00:31:44.746]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:31:45.046 --> 00:31:49.172]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.

[00:32:14.416 --> 00:32:22.323]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:22.484 --> 00:32:29.530]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:30.951]  There are no side effects.
[00:32:31.091 --> 00:32:34.493]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:32:34.553 --> 00:32:35.653]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:32:35.954 --> 00:32:37.234]  Eliminate the cause.
[00:32:37.435 --> 00:32:44.258]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[00:32:50.621 --> 00:32:52.642]  One more time.
[00:32:52.682 --> 00:32:54.442]  That's 866-885-6625.
[00:32:54.682 --> 00:33:10.687]  I always say I'm gonna attempt to beat your calls quickly and then rarely do it.
[00:33:11.408 --> 00:33:12.608]  But let's try to do it right now.
[00:33:13.468 --> 00:33:14.969]  Jason and Marilyn, you're on the air.
[00:33:15.009 --> 00:33:15.349]  Welcome.
[00:33:16.235 --> 00:33:16.515]  Hello.
[00:33:16.916 --> 00:33:17.116]  Yes.
[00:33:17.616 --> 00:33:22.740]  Yes, I was wondering if you had ever heard of or read a book called Towards Soviet America?
[00:33:25.021 --> 00:33:28.144]  I have referenced the book and seen it referenced.
[00:33:28.404 --> 00:33:30.045]  I have not read the entire publication.
[00:33:30.745 --> 00:33:31.366]  I haven't either.
[00:33:31.546 --> 00:33:35.148]  I just read about it through David J. Smith.
[00:33:35.249 --> 00:33:40.112]  I'm sure you're familiar with his stuff, which Genesis advertises.
[00:33:40.132 --> 00:33:44.975]  Yeah, he's been a guest probably about 15 times over the last 10 years.
[00:33:45.055 --> 00:33:45.656]  I have him on about
[00:33:46.474 --> 00:33:48.075]  More than, I guess, more than 15 times.
[00:33:48.235 --> 00:33:51.578]  I've been interviewing him for 10 years, about twice a year.
[00:33:51.598 --> 00:33:52.878]  He's been on about 20 times.
[00:33:53.559 --> 00:34:00.283]  Do you believe, like he does, in the strength of the Communist-Illuminati connection?
[00:34:01.104 --> 00:34:05.247]  I mean, that they're at the top of the food chain?
[00:34:06.548 --> 00:34:09.289]  I don't know if Mr. Smith believes they're at the top of the food chain.
[00:34:09.309 --> 00:34:14.493]  I think he believes, rightly so, that it's one of the main implementation arms of the globalists.
[00:34:16.052 --> 00:34:21.275]  Do you believe that Clinton was handpicked by the Jesuits, like Mr. Smith said in his publication?
[00:34:22.936 --> 00:34:26.618]  I haven't, as I said, is that Mr. Smith's publication?
[00:34:26.858 --> 00:34:27.298]  Yes, sir.
[00:34:27.558 --> 00:34:28.359]  News Watch.
[00:34:29.859 --> 00:34:32.441]  I think certainly that the Jesuits are involved in the New World Order.
[00:34:32.481 --> 00:34:34.842]  I mean, Ratzinger just called for the New World Order again.
[00:34:34.882 --> 00:34:37.684]  That's like five times since he's been in for six months.
[00:34:37.904 --> 00:34:38.904]  It's like almost every month.
[00:34:38.964 --> 00:34:42.026]  And then Pope John Paul II did it too.
[00:34:42.046 --> 00:34:45.108]  I'm sorry, it's not Ratzinger, it's Benedict II.
[00:34:46.334 --> 00:34:47.775]  I just can't get over the name Ratzinger.
[00:34:48.055 --> 00:34:50.436]  Ratzinger, he was a... Hitler Youth.
[00:34:50.616 --> 00:34:50.937]  Right.
[00:34:51.557 --> 00:34:56.620]  That's admitted by the way, and they arrest mainstream Italian journalists if they write about that.
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:05.685]  Do you believe, have you heard that Wojtyla was a salesman for the chemical plants that manufactured the...
[00:35:06.693 --> 00:35:09.574]  The nerve gas that killed the Jews?
[00:35:10.075 --> 00:35:12.396]  I have seen that, but I have not confirmed that.
[00:35:12.756 --> 00:35:14.777]  It is confirmed that Ratzinger was a Hitler Youth.
[00:35:14.977 --> 00:35:15.737]  Thank you for the call.
[00:35:16.497 --> 00:35:20.519]  Let me try to comment on this whole communist left-right paradigm.
[00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:23.500]  This is not my opinion.
[00:35:24.821 --> 00:35:29.223]  This is the historical, verifiable, demonstrated fact.
[00:35:30.086 --> 00:35:44.130]  We just heard a David J. Smith ad earlier, and I've interviewed the FBI agent who was the chief guy there in the White House, who witnessed it all many years ago, with his unlimited access book that the David J. Smith, Pastor Smith quoted, from Waukesha, Hatchie, Texas.
[00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:49.211]  I think what Smith does overall is very positive and does a great work.
[00:35:49.291 --> 00:35:51.732]  You know, I don't have an orthodoxy.
[00:35:52.812 --> 00:35:58.234]  You see, like the 9-11 Truth Movement, I don't tell everybody what they should think or what they should believe or what they should say about 9-11.
[00:35:59.514 --> 00:36:02.997]  And I've given many different views on how the Global has carried out 9-11.
[00:36:03.937 --> 00:36:05.999]  I've given those people platforms on this show.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.681]  Different views, different schools.
[00:36:09.402 --> 00:36:14.365]  Because I don't try to have an orthodoxy and stifle people's discussion of something.
[00:36:14.706 --> 00:36:25.934]  And then I always enjoy then how some of the very people I've given platforms, then, little do I know, while I'm interviewing, they're typing on their website, you know, under pen names attacking me.
[00:36:25.954 --> 00:36:26.975]  I mean, you've got to love it.
[00:36:26.995 --> 00:36:28.116]  This is because they're egomaniacs.
[00:36:29.013 --> 00:36:30.173]  They're in this for the wrong reasons.
[00:36:30.694 --> 00:36:31.694]  I'm kind of digressing.
[00:36:31.794 --> 00:36:32.934]  I want to get back to the calls.
[00:36:33.995 --> 00:36:36.055]  But I'm trying to answer this question in a roundabout way.
[00:36:36.095 --> 00:36:42.178]  Just like I don't believe in orthodoxy for truth-telling and investigating the New World Order and the truth movement.
[00:36:43.898 --> 00:36:44.918]  None of us are completely right.
[00:36:44.979 --> 00:36:46.199]  None of us have all the answers.
[00:36:46.259 --> 00:36:49.100]  And so many people get caught up in saying it's just this group.
[00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:49.940]  It's the Protestants.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:50.740]  It's the Catholics.
[00:36:50.801 --> 00:36:51.561]  It's the Jews.
[00:36:51.641 --> 00:36:53.241]  It's the Communists.
[00:36:53.381 --> 00:36:54.402]  It's just this group.
[00:36:54.442 --> 00:36:55.502]  It's just that group.
[00:36:55.882 --> 00:36:56.823]  It's only this group.
[00:36:56.883 --> 00:36:57.903]  It's only that group.
[00:36:59.358 --> 00:37:01.939]  Whereas, from my study, it's men in high places.
[00:37:01.999 --> 00:37:03.000]  It's women in high places.
[00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:03.760]  It's elites.
[00:37:04.581 --> 00:37:05.721]  Nebuchadnezzar was evil.
[00:37:05.781 --> 00:37:06.522]  He was a Persian.
[00:37:10.083 --> 00:37:10.964]  Saul was evil.
[00:37:11.024 --> 00:37:11.724]  He was a Jew.
[00:37:13.525 --> 00:37:14.326]  Really, that's incorrect.
[00:37:14.346 --> 00:37:15.266]  That was just one tribe.
[00:37:16.046 --> 00:37:20.389]  And he was an Israeli, an Israelite.
[00:37:20.569 --> 00:37:23.770]  So, this is what I'm trying to say.
[00:37:25.791 --> 00:37:26.992]  This is what I'm trying to get at.
[00:37:29.272 --> 00:37:31.613]  And so people get caught up in these terms, these labels.
[00:37:31.673 --> 00:37:32.613]  This is what happened.
[00:37:35.654 --> 00:37:43.036]  The globalists, the mercantilists, the royal families, tried to control the renaissance through mercantilism.
[00:37:43.837 --> 00:37:54.680]  And that's where, through licensing, the Queen would allow certain companies and certain individuals, monopolies, or shared monopolies, syndicates,
[00:37:57.242 --> 00:38:02.688]  Where you have a monopoly by a group over entire sectors of the economy.
[00:38:02.708 --> 00:38:07.553]  It was an attempt at continuing feudalism and serfdom over the population.
[00:38:08.534 --> 00:38:12.599]  And then that failed by the 1850s, and they were really losing control.
[00:38:12.619 --> 00:38:14.621]  They were really concerned about the U.S.
[00:38:15.296 --> 00:38:22.842]  That was producing more wealth than all of Europe times three and was exposing the corrupt systems and an unfree system can't compete with a free system.
[00:38:23.162 --> 00:38:31.228]  So they wrote letters and openly said we've got to create a system to get the serfs back on the plantations, back on the reservations, back on the feudal plots.
[00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:41.236]  And so they commissioned the writing of the Communist Manifesto by Marx and Engels, who lived in London,
[00:38:42.486 --> 00:38:50.812]  London's always been the heart of International Socialism, Fabian Socialism, and really, they just confuse the terms.
[00:38:50.912 --> 00:38:57.797]  Fascism, Socialism, Communism, they're all different variants of Mercantile, or Centralization, or Corporatism.
[00:38:58.198 --> 00:39:10.967]  You always are going to have a strongman, or group of strongmen that run it, and any time they get arrested, or killed, or taken down, you're going to find out that Rothschilds, or Rockefellers, or Saxe-Coburg-Gothas are the real shareholders of the company.
[00:39:11.934 --> 00:39:18.639]  And these internationalists, if any one dictator or country gets out of line, they control all the other countries, they can bring them to bear on that one country.
[00:39:18.919 --> 00:39:22.622]  So it's a constant chessboard, there's a lot of backstabbing and things that go on.
[00:39:23.843 --> 00:39:28.426]  So they told the working man, hey, you want to get those big rich industrialists, you want to
[00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:31.412]  You want to get all the rich people.
[00:39:31.472 --> 00:39:32.453]  You want to pay them back.
[00:39:32.473 --> 00:39:33.694]  You want to get your fair share.
[00:39:33.734 --> 00:39:34.655]  They're greedy and bad.
[00:39:35.176 --> 00:39:38.860]  Meanwhile, it was the big boys, the bankers wearing the top hats that actually financed it.
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:44.026]  They told them, what you do is you vote for big government to come take the money away from the rich people.
[00:39:44.066 --> 00:39:50.793]  And of course, some poor person working in a coal mine or some poor guy working in a factory, living in a shack with his kids starving to death.
[00:39:51.451 --> 00:39:52.652]  Who hadn't had an education.
[00:39:52.712 --> 00:40:03.817]  To him, somebody living in a two-story house with two servants and four kids and, you know, having a post and chaise with three horses pulling their wagon.
[00:40:04.277 --> 00:40:05.797]  Man, that's, that, they're rich!
[00:40:05.978 --> 00:40:07.718]  Well, no, they're middle class.
[00:40:08.739 --> 00:40:09.919]  They actually employ you.
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:17.983]  And they're actually poor dumb saps that'll actually vote for your socialism, feeling sorry for you, so they can be putting the poor house in the shack with you.
[00:40:21.687 --> 00:40:23.167]  And so, that's what happened.
[00:40:23.667 --> 00:40:25.508]  And there was the Lenin's train of gold.
[00:40:25.528 --> 00:40:33.629]  He was about to lose against the White Russians, against the Tsarists, and $25 million from New York and London, and the U.S.
[00:40:33.709 --> 00:40:41.550]  and British governments aided them in bringing them down, and they were our big allies right through World War II, even while Joe Stalin made deals with Hitler to divide up Poland.
[00:40:43.371 --> 00:40:45.331]  Our government funded Hitler at the very same time.
[00:40:46.131 --> 00:40:47.331]  They were setting him up, though.
[00:40:47.351 --> 00:40:49.292]  He thought he was being given the keys to the city.
[00:40:49.312 --> 00:40:50.412]  They didn't know it was a setup.
[00:40:51.152 --> 00:40:53.034]  And he was clearly controlled by British intelligence.
[00:40:53.074 --> 00:40:54.375]  That's even mainstream news now.
[00:40:56.857 --> 00:40:57.757]  That is manipulated.
[00:40:58.038 --> 00:40:59.419]  A wind-up toy is what they call it.
[00:40:59.439 --> 00:41:02.841]  I said I was going to take calls, but the listener brings up this incredible question.
[00:41:04.062 --> 00:41:10.948]  So are there armies of socialists and communists infiltrating the Department of Labor, the Department of Commerce, the Immigration?
[00:41:12.121 --> 00:41:13.022]  Ice, all of it.
[00:41:13.703 --> 00:41:15.344]  Do they call themselves communist?
[00:41:15.384 --> 00:41:17.065]  Yes, but just vehicles of power.
[00:41:17.125 --> 00:41:22.369]  Vehicles to con the well-meaning... You see, they've got to have a fake counter-revolution of the New World Order.
[00:41:22.649 --> 00:41:24.110]  They know the youth are going to rebel.
[00:41:24.631 --> 00:41:27.493]  They know the people are going to rebel against this elite corporate system.
[00:41:28.073 --> 00:41:31.576]  And so they go to the universities.
[00:41:34.838 --> 00:41:38.721]  And they go to them and they tell them, yeah, we're going to fight these elite corporations.
[00:41:40.242 --> 00:41:41.043]  We're going to do that.
[00:41:42.893 --> 00:41:44.574]  With socialism, with communism.
[00:41:46.916 --> 00:41:49.978]  And again, it's all about controlling false choices.
[00:41:50.078 --> 00:41:53.600]  Giving you all these false choices, and then you're supposed to select from those.
[00:41:55.982 --> 00:42:10.372]  And every time the head of Yukos Oil gets arrested, or every time the head, the guy that owns all the metals in Russia, you know, the so-called Russian oligarchs were handed all their power two days after Russia supposedly fell, in the early nights.
[00:42:11.696 --> 00:42:19.680]  And then every time one of them dies or gets arrested or doesn't follow his orders and gets removed, it turns out that they displeased Putin.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:23.262]  And then Putin never really seizes any of the assets.
[00:42:23.302 --> 00:42:26.863]  Putin's really just punishing people that didn't follow Lord Rothschild's orders.
[00:42:27.444 --> 00:42:34.707]  And then every time you turn around, Lord Rothschild over in England, it'll be in the Financial Times and other papers, was the shadow owner.
[00:42:34.727 --> 00:42:36.328]  It's like when J.P.
[00:42:36.368 --> 00:42:37.068]  Morgan died.
[00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:40.170]  Turn of the last century.
[00:42:42.597 --> 00:42:44.778]  When he died, it turned out he was worth a couple million dollars.
[00:42:44.798 --> 00:42:51.499]  They thought he was worth billions on paper, but it turned out he was really a Bank of England silent associate.
[00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:55.941]  He was like a CEO of their American division.
[00:42:55.981 --> 00:42:57.821]  He didn't own a fraction of it.
[00:42:58.961 --> 00:43:02.882]  It's like everybody's freaking out over these UAE port deals due by Port World.
[00:43:03.923 --> 00:43:04.823]  British already own that.
[00:43:08.041 --> 00:43:13.426]  You know, I know a little bit about business because I got family and people that are involved in consulting, consolidation, things of that nature.
[00:43:13.766 --> 00:43:14.887]  It's never American money.
[00:43:16.889 --> 00:43:21.893]  It's South African, it's British, it's Dutch, it's German.
[00:43:22.473 --> 00:43:26.897]  Every once in a while it's Middle Eastern or Japanese, Chinese.
[00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:32.922]  And so, you know, that's the real world.
[00:43:33.623 --> 00:43:34.604]  And you can't get
[00:43:36.059 --> 00:43:42.266]  Somebody who's got a Che Guevara tattoo on their arm, you can't get them to go back and understand they're part of a false revolution.
[00:43:44.107 --> 00:43:47.211]  Any more than you're going to get somebody that's got a George W. tattoo on them.
[00:43:47.251 --> 00:43:48.632]  I mean, people do have W tattoos.
[00:43:48.692 --> 00:43:49.653]  I've seen it at the pool.
[00:43:51.215 --> 00:43:52.576]  W stickers on their cars.
[00:43:52.616 --> 00:43:53.557]  They think they're radical.
[00:43:53.597 --> 00:43:54.318]  They think they're cool.
[00:43:54.358 --> 00:43:55.980]  They're just idiots.
[00:43:57.088 --> 00:44:02.232]  This is as big as an idiot who sticks a Bill Clinton or John Kerry sticker on their car.
[00:44:02.252 --> 00:44:05.274]  I mean, John Kerry and George Bush totally staged the election.
[00:44:05.554 --> 00:44:08.496]  Bill Clinton's, quote, a member of the family and vacations with the Bushes.
[00:44:09.697 --> 00:44:24.047]  And yeah, it's true, they hung crack pipes on the Christmas tree at the White House and wore little linen pins around and made little jokes and had little, you know, male member images hanging on the Christmas trees.
[00:44:25.388 --> 00:44:26.088]  Because these are
[00:44:27.725 --> 00:44:32.868]  They're sick people in that I'm not shocked by a crack pipe or by an image of the male member.
[00:44:33.308 --> 00:44:33.948]  Sexual organ.
[00:44:34.849 --> 00:44:44.814]  I'm shocked by full grown adults being so repressed and so stayed and so weirded out.
[00:44:46.375 --> 00:44:49.637]  I mean they're perverted because they're into something that's a joke.
[00:44:50.437 --> 00:44:51.638]  They get off on it.
[00:44:52.355 --> 00:44:56.817]  Well, you've got to be a mental patient to be involved in spraying DU all over the planet.
[00:44:56.837 --> 00:44:58.198]  You've got to be into weird stuff.
[00:44:58.218 --> 00:44:59.219]  Man, they're all weird.
[00:44:59.559 --> 00:45:01.020]  They're into devil worship.
[00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:02.060]  A lot of them are.
[00:45:02.701 --> 00:45:05.002]  A lot of them are just into a bunch of other weird stuff.
[00:45:05.062 --> 00:45:06.383]  I mean, they're a bunch of fruitcakes.
[00:45:07.283 --> 00:45:10.385]  Ronald Reagan, and I mean, he's nothing compared to some of these people.
[00:45:10.445 --> 00:45:11.205]  He's pretty tame.
[00:45:11.806 --> 00:45:13.787]  Went to Bohemian Grove and places, but did right.
[00:45:13.807 --> 00:45:15.047]  Nixon wrote that he didn't like it.
[00:45:15.067 --> 00:45:15.828]  Neither one of them liked it.
[00:45:15.848 --> 00:45:18.009]  You can go read what they said about it.
[00:45:18.569 --> 00:45:19.510]  Can't really quote it on air.
[00:45:22.199 --> 00:45:23.379]  You can even go listen to clips of it.
[00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:31.782]  Harper's Magazine recorded, but uh... What color tie he wore, the exact second that he would give a speech.
[00:45:31.802 --> 00:45:39.865]  Nancy Reagan, who's told a biographer this, when he'd walk to the stage, what day he did it, was all done in these incredibly complex calculations.
[00:45:39.885 --> 00:45:43.686]  The astrologer, many times, would actually be there, right behind the curtain, making sure.
[00:45:43.726 --> 00:45:49.128]  You'll see Reagan walk out, pause, talk to somebody, keep looking at his watch, and in the exact second he starts the speech.
[00:45:49.208 --> 00:45:50.989]  I mean, that's crazy!
[00:45:53.132 --> 00:45:53.512]  Okay?
[00:45:54.473 --> 00:45:55.313]  That's crazy.
[00:45:56.574 --> 00:45:57.575]  I said I'd take your calls.
[00:45:57.615 --> 00:45:59.596]  It's just you bring up these important questions.
[00:46:02.798 --> 00:46:06.560]  And so, I mean, there's got to be something wrong with you when you don't have a conscience.
[00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:15.705]  When I do something bad, when people persecute me and try to take advantage of me, I catch myself feeling bad when I've got to put my foot down on them.
[00:46:20.825 --> 00:46:25.146]  The average person, though, out there who's involved in this evil, they have less and less conscience.
[00:46:25.526 --> 00:46:27.367]  Until one day, the conscience is just gone.
[00:46:27.387 --> 00:46:28.027]  They're seared.
[00:46:30.168 --> 00:46:30.848]  They're blackened.
[00:46:31.068 --> 00:46:31.708]  Their hearts are.
[00:46:32.748 --> 00:46:35.329]  And they have no more real feeling.
[00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:43.071]  You know, talking to psychopaths, interviewing psychopaths, interviewing top psychologists and psychiatrists who've studied this, the criminology, I've read into it quite a bit.
[00:46:45.532 --> 00:46:49.513]  One of my areas of interest, they see a bright, burning light.
[00:46:51.164 --> 00:46:58.692]  They feel alive when they pull the woman's guts out while she's alive and she's screaming in pain in the farmhouse.
[00:46:59.513 --> 00:47:04.198]  And then they drape the intestines on themselves, or they stab them, or they bite chunks out of them.
[00:47:05.239 --> 00:47:10.324]  If a normal person who's not completely reprobate and turned over to degeneracy, you're like, what?
[00:47:10.344 --> 00:47:11.445]  I don't even want to hear about that.
[00:47:11.746 --> 00:47:12.607]  Well, you better hear about it.
[00:47:12.627 --> 00:47:13.808]  I mean, what do you think a communist
[00:47:15.123 --> 00:47:24.189]  Soldier, when he takes a woman's year old baby, she's been hiding because she's had three kids and walks it outside and bashes its brains out right in front of her there and knocks her teeth out.
[00:47:24.249 --> 00:47:24.930]  This is admitted.
[00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:31.034]  Or when people go to a sports stadium and cheer as they kill some political dissident, shoot them or chop their heads off.
[00:47:31.094 --> 00:47:34.296]  Or in China, where little dead babies rot on street corners.
[00:47:36.157 --> 00:47:37.158]  See, that's seared.
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:40.740]  That's seared.
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:44.482]  And the globalists know that they're searing us with the violence on television.
[00:47:44.822 --> 00:47:48.564]  They're searing us with 24 where they torture children almost every other episode.
[00:47:50.045 --> 00:47:54.126]  Where they torture, you know, just innocent people because that's what the good guys do.
[00:47:54.226 --> 00:47:55.367]  See, you're being warped.
[00:47:55.407 --> 00:47:56.808]  You're being brought into darkness.
[00:47:58.228 --> 00:48:01.550]  You're being given the taste of their father, the devil.
[00:48:03.070 --> 00:48:08.853]  And if you don't even believe in the devil, you might as well, because their manifestation of those beliefs makes it real.
[00:48:10.521 --> 00:48:12.082]  I believe in a real personal devil.
[00:48:13.783 --> 00:48:15.344]  I believe there is an evil force.
[00:48:16.445 --> 00:48:17.786]  This universe is so complex.
[00:48:17.846 --> 00:48:19.027]  It's thousands of dimensions.
[00:48:19.087 --> 00:48:20.008]  All the things that have happened.
[00:48:20.228 --> 00:48:20.868]  This planet.
[00:48:20.888 --> 00:48:22.710]  This planet's a huge spaceship, folks.
[00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:24.451]  Flying around the sun.
[00:48:27.113 --> 00:48:33.197]  But see, I don't even get into that stuff because that isn't... That isn't something I even get into because you can debate it.
[00:48:33.257 --> 00:48:34.858]  You can't debate they believe that, though.
[00:48:35.298 --> 00:48:37.360]  You can't debate that the elite are a bunch of Satanists.
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:39.081]  You understand that?
[00:48:41.306 --> 00:48:44.028]  And so if David J. Smith thinks it's all communists running things, fine.
[00:48:44.128 --> 00:48:47.410]  You know, that's a big part of the New World Order.
[00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:50.291]  That's a big part of their modus operandi.
[00:48:51.572 --> 00:48:54.334]  And he'll say they're globalists, he'll say they're Illuminati, and he's waking people up.
[00:48:55.734 --> 00:48:59.537]  So I'm not here to tell him the, you know... But then you ask me, am I orthodox?
[00:48:59.577 --> 00:49:01.238]  Do I follow an exact orthodoxy?
[00:49:02.478 --> 00:49:03.239]  I follow the truth.
[00:49:03.399 --> 00:49:03.939]  I know the truth.
[00:49:03.999 --> 00:49:04.720]  It set me free.
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:07.061]  I'm not fighting communists.
[00:49:07.121 --> 00:49:08.302]  I'm not fighting republicans.
[00:49:08.862 --> 00:49:10.243]  I'm fighting seared
[00:49:11.136 --> 00:49:17.621]  Destroyed, malfunctioning slaves, husk, who have just been filled with just a dark energy.
[00:49:18.302 --> 00:49:18.962]  They're zombies.
[00:49:19.803 --> 00:49:20.804]  Our enemies are zombies.
[00:49:23.045 --> 00:49:23.746]  And they hate us.
[00:49:23.786 --> 00:49:24.587]  They hate the light.
[00:49:24.627 --> 00:49:25.507]  They hate our energy.
[00:49:25.828 --> 00:49:26.688]  They hate our power.
[00:49:26.989 --> 00:49:27.789]  They're afraid of us.
[00:49:27.809 --> 00:49:37.337]  You understand how much more powerful, awakened, enlightened, informed, dynamic people who are clear thinking and can see what's happening?
[00:49:37.377 --> 00:49:38.958]  You know how scary we are to them?
[00:49:40.686 --> 00:49:43.747]  I have seen George Bush look at me with fear.
[00:49:44.967 --> 00:49:47.887]  Like I was a thousand foot giant.
[00:49:48.987 --> 00:49:51.048]  I've seen Janet Reno look at me with fear.
[00:49:51.888 --> 00:49:53.668]  I've seen Hillary Clinton look at me with fear.
[00:49:54.008 --> 00:49:56.709]  Congressmen, Senators that are on the dark side look at me with fear.
[00:49:56.989 --> 00:49:58.249]  They step aside.
[00:49:59.389 --> 00:50:01.610]  Not because I'm big and powerful, I'm just a little man.
[00:50:02.130 --> 00:50:05.710]  But compared to them, little worms, I am a giant!
[00:50:08.171 --> 00:50:09.011]  We're conquerors!
[00:50:10.663 --> 00:50:11.543]  Do you understand that?
[00:50:11.583 --> 00:50:12.944]  We're life force.
[00:50:13.864 --> 00:50:14.505]  We're life.
[00:50:14.865 --> 00:50:15.705]  We like life.
[00:50:16.165 --> 00:50:17.206]  I like good things.
[00:50:17.546 --> 00:50:18.406]  I like good food.
[00:50:18.466 --> 00:50:19.207]  I like love.
[00:50:19.527 --> 00:50:20.387]  I like passion.
[00:50:20.647 --> 00:50:21.427]  I like beauty.
[00:50:23.348 --> 00:50:24.249]  I love goodness.
[00:50:25.649 --> 00:50:26.630]  I have a soft heart.
[00:50:26.810 --> 00:50:27.890]  That's power.
[00:50:29.051 --> 00:50:32.172]  Power isn't the power to strangle your puppy.
[00:50:33.274 --> 00:50:34.194]  It's with the Greek military.
[00:50:34.254 --> 00:50:35.234]  One of my friends told me about it.
[00:50:35.254 --> 00:50:35.775]  I went and researched it.
[00:50:35.795 --> 00:50:36.155]  It's true.
[00:50:36.515 --> 00:50:39.916]  Greek military, yeah, you have to keep a dog or a cat for a year.
[00:50:39.956 --> 00:50:40.876]  At the end of it, you've got to strangle it.
[00:50:41.196 --> 00:50:41.896]  That's not power.
[00:50:43.477 --> 00:50:47.558]  Power is having the nerve and that fear of pressure to say, no, I'm not going to do it.
[00:50:49.758 --> 00:50:51.318]  Power is not going with the crowd.
[00:50:51.799 --> 00:50:53.939]  Power is having a conscience.
[00:50:54.279 --> 00:50:55.319]  Being tuned into God.
[00:50:55.339 --> 00:50:57.060]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[00:50:57.080 --> 00:51:01.461]  We'll go to Kathy, Levi, Dave, Eric, and many others.
[00:51:02.682 --> 00:51:05.544]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.785 --> 00:51:07.386]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:07.706 --> 00:51:12.390]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:19.476]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:19.796 --> 00:51:21.758]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:51:21.978 --> 00:51:24.821]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:24.921 --> 00:51:29.565]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:29.785 --> 00:51:34.189]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.429 --> 00:51:41.656]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:41.916 --> 00:51:44.318]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[00:52:01.698 --> 00:52:03.659]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[00:52:03.759 --> 00:52:14.464]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:52:14.844 --> 00:52:19.366]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:52:19.426 --> 00:52:30.772]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:52:31.352 --> 00:52:38.197]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:52:38.597 --> 00:52:40.738]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:52:41.239 --> 00:52:46.202]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.

[00:53:01.172 --> 00:53:03.613]  I think so.
[00:53:18.837 --> 00:53:19.498]  We're good to go!
[00:53:48.357 --> 00:53:51.439]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:51.619 --> 00:53:57.483]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:17.053 --> 00:54:24.198]  They laid their bodies down for you and I. For freedom.
[00:54:24.218 --> 00:54:27.400]  Now we're a beacon of tyranny.
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:29.482]  I've got two big reports in the U.S.
[00:54:30.403 --> 00:54:36.407]  and overseas where reporters are being arrested or being threatened with arrest for reporting on government corruption.
[00:54:37.268 --> 00:54:38.709]  Just like the Soviet Union under Putin.
[00:54:38.749 --> 00:54:40.690]  No, you reported bad on me, I'm gonna arrest you.
[00:54:41.090 --> 00:54:42.712]  We're like, oh, look how bad Putin is.
[00:54:43.512 --> 00:54:44.573]  Now it's happening here.
[00:54:45.777 --> 00:54:48.299]  See, we're getting really far down the rat hole.
[00:54:48.319 --> 00:54:51.681]  Before I go to Kathy and others, I've made 14 films.
[00:54:52.962 --> 00:54:58.366]  Films like Comprehensive Angle, Financial Reports Exposed, Road to Tyranny, Martial Law, the new one The Order of Death.

[00:55:28.814 --> 00:55:31.797]  Joan V. Hans, United Nations Global Straitjacket.

[00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:11.602]  Alright, let's go to Kathy in Texas.
[00:56:11.622 --> 00:56:12.302]  Kathy, go ahead.
[00:56:12.642 --> 00:56:13.243]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:56:13.603 --> 00:56:19.888]  On Sunday night on Discovery Channel, Discovery Channel aired Perfect Disaster.
[00:56:20.448 --> 00:56:23.791]  And it is significant because in January, the Weather Channel
[00:56:24.706 --> 00:56:34.109]  It could happen tomorrow, in which New York was hit by a massive hurricane and destroyed, Dallas was hit by a F5 tornado and destroyed.
[00:56:34.129 --> 00:56:41.791]  The narrator said it was not if, but when it would happen, and they intimated that those could happen in the next two years.
[00:56:42.387 --> 00:56:49.993]  Also, in the commercial for this Sunday program coming up on Discovery Channel, it showed Dallas being hit by something.
[00:56:50.533 --> 00:57:02.782]  And of course, oil storm on FX had New Orleans being hit the exact same way, and the very same, the real mayor and the real governor in the film, and they like to drill all this.
[00:57:02.842 --> 00:57:06.364]  For those that don't know, the government does have weather control and weather modification.
[00:57:06.384 --> 00:57:10.067]  We've had the father of weather weapons on, the father of using them.
[00:57:10.982 --> 00:57:13.404]  And, uh, you know, he hasn't been involved in it in years.
[00:57:13.464 --> 00:57:15.145]  He knows they can, quote, control hurricanes.
[00:57:15.205 --> 00:57:16.465]  He's like, why don't they stop them?
[00:57:17.446 --> 00:57:25.611]  And, uh, yeah, and then destroy a few cities, and, oh, we gotta have a global tax to fix global warming, when a global tax has nothing to do with global warming.
[00:57:26.204 --> 00:57:28.205]  So it's just mindlessness.
[00:57:28.245 --> 00:57:29.386]  It gets everybody emotional.
[00:57:29.746 --> 00:57:30.606]  I don't know what's going to happen.
[00:57:30.646 --> 00:57:40.311]  I'm not going to say those cities are going to be destroyed, but the sun is about to increase in brightness and by its radiated power by 50% in the next 11-year cycle.
[00:57:40.711 --> 00:57:45.554]  NASA's saying, and if that's true, believe me, our cars are nothing compared to that.
[00:57:47.315 --> 00:57:55.579]  I just think it should be an interesting program to watch, to see how it might kind of tie in with the others that they've aired, like you said.
[00:57:57.395 --> 00:57:59.277]  No, I hear you.
[00:58:00.297 --> 00:58:00.878]  I agree with you.
[00:58:00.918 --> 00:58:01.438]  Anything else?
[00:58:01.919 --> 00:58:02.539]  No, that was it.
[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:03.860]  Thank you for the call.
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:14.689]  We're going to come back and go to Levi and Dave and Eric and others, but I keep getting requests for it, so we're going to play a little piece called Dark Side.
[00:58:15.650 --> 00:58:17.451]  We haven't aired in about four or five months.
[00:58:18.592 --> 00:58:21.514]  When we come back out of this next break, can you grab that by then, John?
[00:58:23.356 --> 00:58:25.578]  We're going to come out of break in the next segment and play
[00:58:27.023 --> 00:58:32.925]  Darkside, concerning the New World Order, and then we'll continue with your calls and get into all the news.
[00:58:33.385 --> 00:58:36.126]  Alright, wide open phones, continuing with the news and your calls, 800-259-9231.
[00:58:36.146 --> 00:58:38.487]  Stay with us.
[00:58:41.388 --> 00:58:46.030]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:59:00.843 --> 00:59:08.087]  You don't know the power of the Dark Side.
[00:59:08.167 --> 00:59:16.992]  Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks of September 11th.
[00:59:17.012 --> 00:59:18.012]  The Dark Side.
[00:59:24.676 --> 00:59:31.821]  It's a chance to use this disaster to carry out the craze his father used, I think, only once.
[00:59:33.663 --> 00:59:35.604]  And that is a New World Order.
[00:59:36.264 --> 00:59:45.831]  Out of these troubled times, our message gets through.
[00:59:45.891 --> 00:59:48.093]  The New World Order can emerge.
[00:59:48.373 --> 00:59:49.334]  The dark side.
[00:59:58.077 --> 01:00:16.469]  New World Order is run by absolute ruthless individuals.
[01:00:16.569 --> 01:00:19.471]  Obsessed, totals and foes.
[01:00:29.777 --> 01:00:31.458]  Worldwide terror.
[01:00:35.099 --> 01:00:38.021]  Call the New World Order.
[01:00:40.282 --> 01:00:42.843]  The dark side.
[01:00:44.263 --> 01:00:48.725]  The danger to our country is great.
[01:00:49.006 --> 01:00:52.607]  The danger to our country is broken.
[01:00:52.627 --> 01:00:55.689]  The danger to our country is great.
[01:00:55.809 --> 01:00:58.810]  The danger to our country is broken.
[01:01:07.617 --> 01:01:08.297]  How long it takes.
[01:01:09.218 --> 01:01:15.221]  This is a larger campaign against anybody who hates the new world order.
[01:01:15.301 --> 01:01:16.622]  We are the future.
[01:01:16.682 --> 01:01:20.123]  We are the future.
[01:01:20.404 --> 01:01:22.605]  Attention, attention, attention.
[01:01:22.625 --> 01:01:26.847]  American forces are here to help.
[01:01:26.867 --> 01:01:27.447]  Remain calm.
[01:01:28.628 --> 01:01:31.569]  We will not tolerate civil disobedience.
[01:01:31.749 --> 01:01:34.091]  I need to know who you are.
[01:01:34.771 --> 01:01:36.752]  I have no idea who you are.
[01:01:42.973 --> 01:01:43.834]  Go down the road.
[01:01:44.235 --> 01:01:44.735]  Step out.
[01:01:44.936 --> 01:01:46.538]  Attention, attention, attention.
[01:01:46.598 --> 01:01:49.242]  American forces are here to help.
[01:01:49.262 --> 01:01:50.464]  Remain calm.
[01:01:50.484 --> 01:01:54.871]  We will not tolerate civil disobedience.
[01:02:29.004 --> 01:02:29.704]  Back live.
[01:02:31.145 --> 01:02:32.826]  Let's go ahead and go to Levi in Colorado.
[01:02:32.846 --> 01:02:33.747]  Levi, you're on the air.
[01:02:33.787 --> 01:02:34.127]  Welcome.
[01:02:34.667 --> 01:02:35.768]  Hey, how's it going, Alec?
[01:02:35.868 --> 01:02:36.208]  Good, sir.
[01:02:36.548 --> 01:02:37.349]  I like that song.
[01:02:37.389 --> 01:02:42.231]  It almost sounds like it was made using Sonic Foundry, or I guess it's Sony now.
[01:02:42.372 --> 01:02:43.152]  Sony Acid.
[01:02:44.553 --> 01:02:45.433]  I didn't put it together.
[01:02:45.914 --> 01:02:47.174]  Some listener emailed it to us.
[01:02:47.194 --> 01:02:48.015]  We get a lot of that stuff.
[01:02:48.075 --> 01:02:48.775]  It's great.
[01:02:48.895 --> 01:02:53.798]  I've actually got a couple songs I've made in Acid with sound samples of you in them.
[01:02:54.238 --> 01:02:54.699]  Oh, great.
[01:02:54.719 --> 01:02:55.179]  Send them to us.
[01:02:55.852 --> 01:02:57.633]  Yeah, once I get them finished, I probably will.
[01:02:59.014 --> 01:03:02.577]  But you're actually a big inspiration to a lot of people, I think.
[01:03:03.257 --> 01:03:14.685]  I know you don't like when people call up and slobber all over you, but you're a real big inspiration to a lot of people, and it's just funny how you accomplish that just by telling the truth.
[01:03:15.246 --> 01:03:20.950]  It's not like you're doing anything really all that remarkable, but in this day and age, it is remarkable.
[01:03:23.001 --> 01:03:28.405]  Well, George Orwell said that in an age of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[01:03:29.065 --> 01:03:32.768]  Yeah, you actually inspired me to become a filmmaker.
[01:03:32.788 --> 01:03:34.409]  I'm working on two films right now.
[01:03:35.090 --> 01:03:36.571]  Stay there, I got a break.
[01:03:37.652 --> 01:03:39.013]  I hear the music.
[01:03:39.693 --> 01:03:42.235]  When we get back, we'll come right back to you, Levi, okay?
[01:03:42.255 --> 01:03:42.355]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:42.375 --> 01:03:45.958]  It's a toll-free number, lots of your calls, and a ton of news straight ahead.
[01:03:54.119 --> 01:03:57.041]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:03:57.721 --> 01:03:59.002]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:03:59.222 --> 01:04:04.966]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:04:05.226 --> 01:04:10.490]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:04:10.790 --> 01:04:12.391]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order

[01:07:00.777 --> 01:07:03.638]  Wide open phones on this live Friday edition.
[01:07:03.678 --> 01:07:06.259]  We just cut Levi a little bit short from Colorado.
[01:07:06.739 --> 01:07:09.680]  So let's go back to Levi before we go to Dave, Eric, Stan and others.
[01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:11.441]  Levi, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:07:12.261 --> 01:07:23.885]  Hey, I just wanted to say, like I said, you're a big inspiration to a lot of people and you actually inspired me to make a few films.
[01:07:24.688 --> 01:07:32.931]  One's going to be basically a documentary about the Mexican border and about the border crossings by the Mexican military.
[01:07:32.951 --> 01:07:42.375]  We're going to interview Castillo, the third guy, the former DEA agent that's talking about Los Dedos.
[01:07:42.395 --> 01:07:46.337]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:07:47.057 --> 01:07:54.220]  And so that's going to be the subject of the first one, just sort of the craziness on the Mexican border and the stuff you guys are dealing with down there.
[01:07:55.001 --> 01:08:12.903]  And the other one's gonna actually be, it's gonna be called Puppet Show, and it's gonna be like actual puppets, kind of like Sesame Street, but it's gonna be a film, you know, with sort of a parody of the sort of tyranny and the loss of civil liberties and the criminality and the sort of just ridiculousness of the
[01:08:13.618 --> 01:08:15.259]  That sounds really funny.
[01:08:15.299 --> 01:08:16.600]  Send me a copy of it when you're done.
[01:08:16.821 --> 01:08:24.527]  Yeah, that one, I mean we've still got to like make everything and that one's going to be kind of intensive so I might finish the border one first.
[01:08:24.727 --> 01:08:26.268]  Good, well send it to me when you're done.
[01:08:26.628 --> 01:08:27.589]  Levi, thanks for the call.
[01:08:27.609 --> 01:08:28.330]  I'm going to move on.
[01:08:29.130 --> 01:08:31.052]  Dave in California, you're on the air.
[01:08:31.112 --> 01:08:31.672]  Go ahead, Dave.
[01:08:31.812 --> 01:08:32.533]  Good morning, Alex.
[01:08:32.733 --> 01:08:32.993]  Hi.
[01:08:33.193 --> 01:08:34.374]  I've got a couple things for you.
[01:08:34.574 --> 01:08:39.678]  One, a couple months ago I signed up for PrisonPlanet.tv and it was the best money I ever spent.
[01:08:39.718 --> 01:08:40.319]  That's a fact.
[01:08:42.239 --> 01:08:44.581]  There's a lot of media on there, so I appreciate your support.
[01:08:44.661 --> 01:08:45.322]  There certainly is.
[01:08:45.342 --> 01:08:47.304]  And I like the anonymous surfer, too.
[01:08:47.324 --> 01:08:49.046]  You don't mention that, but that's really cool.
[01:08:49.246 --> 01:08:51.648]  I don't really worry about anonymity.
[01:08:52.049 --> 01:08:54.191]  You know, I've probably got a file a mile high.
[01:08:54.211 --> 01:08:54.731]  I don't care.
[01:08:55.052 --> 01:08:58.235]  But for people that are concerned with it, the anonymous surfer is a really good thing.
[01:08:59.095 --> 01:09:00.597]  And I have an issue here.
[01:09:00.677 --> 01:09:03.580]  Have you heard about the Uniformity in Food Act?
[01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:08.461]  Yes, I've got all sorts of new regulations coming in.
[01:09:08.741 --> 01:09:09.701]  Tell the listeners about it.
[01:09:09.922 --> 01:09:12.922]  Okay, I've jotted down a bunch of the high points.
[01:09:13.363 --> 01:09:21.805]  Apparently it's been passed by the Congress, or the House, but not the Senate yet, although I'm not sure, you know, it's supposed to be in the Senate right now.
[01:09:21.845 --> 01:09:24.746]  And that's the one where they will take away your organic labeling.
[01:09:25.066 --> 01:09:33.489]  Yeah, it deletes 50 states milk safety laws, it deletes 50 states rules over restaurants, schools, nursing homes, and other food service establishments.
[01:09:33.985 --> 01:09:37.306]  It removes 50 states' shelter safety standards.
[01:09:37.886 --> 01:09:40.506]  It deletes two states' laws governing egg safety.
[01:09:40.526 --> 01:09:43.347]  Well, that's because you can't have those under NAFTA and GATT.
[01:09:43.967 --> 01:09:53.229]  I mean, all the time, companies and governments and locales aren't allowed to even have their own laws because, oh, it violates a treaty.
[01:09:53.249 --> 01:09:56.030]  And then you read the treaty, it's all one way.
[01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:58.130]  It's designed to de-industrialize us.
[01:09:59.051 --> 01:10:10.279]  And they've also now passed, or about to fully pass, it's passed out of one house of the Congress, one side, and they're going to go right to Bush's desk if it passes the Senate.
[01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:20.326]  And that is to where you can have 75% genetically engineered product in a food and still call it organic.
[01:10:21.028 --> 01:10:24.471]  Yeah, they're not even going to let us know what we're eating now.
[01:10:25.031 --> 01:10:30.035]  And I just mentioned it last hour, they're going to really basically stop testing for mad cow disease in this country.
[01:10:30.656 --> 01:10:39.923]  And they're buying up privately the radiation detectors at formerly governmental institutions, at universities and other areas, because the detectors are picking up high levels of radiation.
[01:10:40.463 --> 01:10:42.365]  I mean, we're entering a hellish system, sir.
[01:10:43.109 --> 01:10:46.751]  Yeah, we certainly are, but I've got to give you your props, man.
[01:10:46.771 --> 01:10:47.951]  Keep doing good work.
[01:10:47.971 --> 01:10:50.332]  You going to run for president?
[01:10:50.752 --> 01:10:52.373]  Somebody called about that yesterday.
[01:10:52.813 --> 01:10:56.535]  You know, you can't run for president until you're 35.
[01:10:57.556 --> 01:10:57.796]  And I'm 32.
[01:10:57.956 --> 01:10:59.176]  Really?
[01:10:59.416 --> 01:11:00.937]  Yes, I'm only 32 years old.
[01:11:00.997 --> 01:11:04.219]  I know I look older, but to do this for 12 years, you will.
[01:11:04.859 --> 01:11:07.300]  But to make a long story short, sir, I really
[01:11:08.084 --> 01:11:11.005]  I don't want to be a, quote, official or authority.
[01:11:11.585 --> 01:11:16.367]  I'm a servant of the people right here, and we need to work more on the local area.
[01:11:17.047 --> 01:11:18.547]  The federal's been totally taken down.
[01:11:19.007 --> 01:11:19.748]  Yeah, I understand.
[01:11:19.988 --> 01:11:21.228]  Hey, I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:11:21.648 --> 01:11:22.849]  Good to hear from you there, Dave.
[01:11:23.369 --> 01:11:26.270]  Eric, Eric is calling us from where, Eric?
[01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:29.371]  Hey, Alex, I'm in Skull and Bones country up in Connecticut.
[01:11:29.711 --> 01:11:30.211]  Ah, yes!
[01:11:30.991 --> 01:11:31.992]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:11:32.132 --> 01:11:32.392]  Sure.
[01:11:34.832 --> 01:11:35.713]  The thing with Iran,
[01:11:36.912 --> 01:11:37.472]  Here's Bush.
[01:11:37.492 --> 01:11:40.193]  He's in a fight with somebody who's basically kicking his tail.
[01:11:40.213 --> 01:11:45.395]  And he wants to start a fight with a bigger and heavier-duty opponent.
[01:11:46.435 --> 01:12:01.321]  And I'm just concerned that people need to really stop and think about any kind of false flag event that's going to happen in the not-too-distant future to rally the people behind an effort on Bush's part, because his numbers are on the toilet.
[01:12:01.841 --> 01:12:04.342]  Explain to people what a false flag is.
[01:12:04.887 --> 01:12:09.472]  A false flag operation, a classic example would be the USS Liberty back in 1968.
[01:12:11.053 --> 01:12:15.678]  Where the Israelis attacked the USS Liberty and they wanted to pin the crime on the Egyptians.
[01:12:16.178 --> 01:12:17.619]  But fortunately they were exposed.
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:25.227]  A false flag operation is any kind of operation which points a false finger of blame to establish a scapegoat.
[01:12:25.934 --> 01:12:32.498]  Yeah, and cops out there think of a false flag as having FBI agents pose as a drug dealer and busting people.
[01:12:32.559 --> 01:12:32.999]  No, no, no.
[01:12:33.299 --> 01:12:34.420]  That's only one variant.
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:51.151]  A false flag is the British running false colors and then attacking a neutral ship, they did this a few times, and killing everyone on board and then getting that foreign country to then join the crown and say a war against Spain or France.
[01:12:51.891 --> 01:12:54.053]  And false flag is a frame-up.
[01:12:54.133 --> 01:12:55.434]  If I want somebody to go to prison,
[01:12:56.215 --> 01:12:58.517]  And at the same time I want to rob someone.
[01:12:58.657 --> 01:13:02.501]  I'll go rob someone and then frame the person I don't like.
[01:13:02.541 --> 01:13:03.241]  That's false flag.
[01:13:03.682 --> 01:13:03.982]  Okay.
[01:13:04.342 --> 01:13:07.425]  Hey Alex, I wanted to talk briefly about energy.
[01:13:07.805 --> 01:13:09.067]  We don't have an energy problem.
[01:13:09.347 --> 01:13:10.428]  We have a political problem.
[01:13:11.669 --> 01:13:16.013]  I've had a secret clearance with the Department of Defense for some time and I work at the local shipyard.
[01:13:16.453 --> 01:13:19.436]  And some time ago we were getting ready to sit down
[01:13:20.447 --> 01:13:24.610]  And work on a system, basically, which would have rendered nuclear power obsolete.
[01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:27.492]  It was known as the electric drive, without going into too many details.
[01:13:27.552 --> 01:13:34.537]  Basically, it was an electromagnetic vorticity system, which would have created kinetic energy, and we could have tapped off of that.
[01:13:35.458 --> 01:13:40.862]  And the old guard in the Pentagon got wind of it, and basically the whole thing dried up like head pain in August.
[01:13:41.702 --> 01:13:48.687]  So, you know, and I called earlier another time about, you know, carburetors that can get 200 miles to the gallon.
[01:13:50.722 --> 01:13:57.866]  General Motors mailed out magazines in the mid-70s with 100 mile carburetors.
[01:13:59.127 --> 01:14:06.511]  Of course they're suppressing massive technological developments, but just looking at what we can totally prove.
[01:14:07.271 --> 01:14:10.873]  There is enough oil off the coast of Louisiana to run this country forever.
[01:14:11.674 --> 01:14:12.514]  They won't let them have it.
[01:14:12.614 --> 01:14:14.956]  Alaska is just floating on oil.
[01:14:15.618 --> 01:14:19.401]  There's oil everywhere, but there's too much oil, so what do the globalists do?
[01:14:19.421 --> 01:14:25.846]  They go fund fake left-wing groups to tell us that, you know, it's peak oil and that's why Bush is evil and invading.
[01:14:25.886 --> 01:14:33.972]  No, they invaded Iraq partially, it's only a small part, because go back to 1990, they were griping at Saddam for over-pumping.
[01:14:33.992 --> 01:14:37.775]  Remember, OPEC was going, you're selling too much, you're driving down prices.
[01:14:38.235 --> 01:14:41.676]  They need to control those countries to keep the oil from flowing.
[01:14:41.716 --> 01:14:43.256]  Dumb neocon followers.
[01:14:43.596 --> 01:14:45.896]  No Alex, no oil is flowing out of Iraq.
[01:14:46.076 --> 01:14:48.317]  Thought you said much more about oil.
[01:14:48.897 --> 01:14:52.157]  Yes, they jack up the price of the oil by not letting that oil flow.
[01:14:52.457 --> 01:14:53.658]  We're swimming in oil, Alex.
[01:14:54.098 --> 01:14:54.658]  One last thing.
[01:14:54.678 --> 01:14:56.058]  It's a joke how much there is.
[01:14:56.318 --> 01:14:56.618]  Oh yeah.
[01:14:56.798 --> 01:14:58.398]  One last thing about these TV shows.
[01:14:58.578 --> 01:15:05.560]  I heard you talking about some of these TV shows and I thought, well... Then I turn on the TV and this new show called The Unit was...
[01:15:07.816 --> 01:15:09.957]  Debuted a few, I guess, last week.
[01:15:11.157 --> 01:15:12.977]  And here's the commander.
[01:15:12.997 --> 01:15:15.538]  They're ready to do this operation on a hijacked airliner.
[01:15:15.578 --> 01:15:18.039]  And I'm thinking, well, we're the local and the state police.
[01:15:18.359 --> 01:15:20.139]  The people who really should be dealing with this.
[01:15:20.159 --> 01:15:22.000]  What are they, at the local donut shop or something?
[01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:24.320]  They've got all these military guys.
[01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:26.401]  The guy, actually, the CO,
[01:15:27.441 --> 01:15:31.262]  Comes right out and says we're suspending posse comitatus.
[01:15:31.402 --> 01:15:33.183]  Alex, you could have knocked me over with a feather.
[01:15:33.543 --> 01:15:48.987]  So when you talk about these shows, the Operation Mockingbird, and how these shows, a lot of these programs are designed basically to condition the American people to have a certain mindset, to adopt a certain philosophy, that is right on the money.
[01:15:49.587 --> 01:15:50.508]  Well, I appreciate the call.
[01:15:50.568 --> 01:15:51.128]  Take care.
[01:15:51.908 --> 01:15:55.249]  You mentioned another false flag, Dr. Paul Gregg Roberts, who was on with us.
[01:15:56.590 --> 01:16:06.078]  Two days ago, Chief Economist, Department of Treasury for Ronald Reagan, icon of conservatism, he kept bringing up, well, Alex, what about what you say?
[01:16:06.118 --> 01:16:06.739]  I agree with that.
[01:16:06.839 --> 01:16:08.180]  They may stage a terror attack.
[01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:09.821]  I mean, he's going all the way now, see?
[01:16:10.562 --> 01:16:11.843]  Here's a big editorial he wrote.
[01:16:11.863 --> 01:16:14.565]  Here's another 9-1-1 in the works.
[01:16:16.227 --> 01:16:21.131]  And later if I have time, I'll read this article, but he goes through that he thinks Bush will probably carry out a terror attack.
[01:16:21.151 --> 01:16:23.153]  I mean, that's Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:16:23.855 --> 01:16:26.656]  Saying that now, because if you've got your head screwed on straight, you know what's going on.
[01:16:27.316 --> 01:16:27.657]  Yeah.
[01:16:28.957 --> 01:16:33.679]  Not all of Hollywood, not all of TV's bought and paid for control, but a lot of it, large portions of it is.
[01:16:34.639 --> 01:16:36.820]  And I call it propaganda placement.
[01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:38.341]  I coined that term many years ago.
[01:16:38.761 --> 01:16:40.422]  And you've all heard of product placement.
[01:16:40.482 --> 01:16:43.363]  People don't watch commercials anymore because of the clicker.
[01:16:44.043 --> 01:16:45.443]  The universal remote.
[01:16:46.404 --> 01:16:51.466]  So now they've been forced to put most of the advertising into the programs themselves.
[01:16:52.512 --> 01:17:05.097]  You all heard about how Bush spent $1.6 billion illegally, GAO, Governmental Accounting Office said it was totally illegal, Bush said I'm above the law, for fake newscasts and to pay off news reporters for certain angles.
[01:17:05.457 --> 01:17:06.698]  Well that was only part of it.
[01:17:08.539 --> 01:17:16.502]  And yeah, I don't watch a lot of TV, very little, but I do read the treatments or the synopses of TV shows.
[01:17:17.202 --> 01:17:18.283]  Of most of the TV shows.
[01:17:19.263 --> 01:17:20.664]  And most TV shows
[01:17:22.187 --> 01:17:23.788]  Say, we're getting rid of posse comitatus.
[01:17:23.828 --> 01:17:25.029]  Martial law keeps you safe.
[01:17:25.069 --> 01:17:27.010]  We're going to have to torture children in front of their parents.
[01:17:27.050 --> 01:17:27.490]  That's good.
[01:17:28.571 --> 01:17:29.872]  I thought Joseph Mengele did that.
[01:17:30.172 --> 01:17:32.213]  But see, now... No, no.
[01:17:32.333 --> 01:17:33.774]  Freedom means torturing children.
[01:17:34.094 --> 01:17:36.015]  Freedoms means troops in black masks.
[01:17:36.916 --> 01:17:44.500]  All these gladiatorial shows with the cops and the Texas SWAT and all that garbage conditions you that, number one, everybody they go after is always a criminal.
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:45.741]  So see, we're all bad.
[01:17:46.061 --> 01:17:46.621]  They're good.
[01:17:46.701 --> 01:17:47.762]  All this force is good.
[01:17:48.182 --> 01:17:49.243]  Meanwhile, the border is wide open.
[01:17:50.643 --> 01:17:52.243]  And yeah, it's pure conditioning.
[01:17:52.723 --> 01:17:57.724]  I remember long before 9-11, I went to the Urban Warfare Drills and witnessed the military trying to take our guns.
[01:17:58.944 --> 01:18:01.665]  And they always said, there's going to be a terror attack and we're going to do this.
[01:18:01.685 --> 01:18:06.486]  9-11 is only the dress rehearsal.
[01:18:06.506 --> 01:18:09.086]  9-11 is only the pretext to line up their ducks.
[01:18:09.526 --> 01:18:10.566]  To set up the dominoes.
[01:18:11.967 --> 01:18:17.047]  The next mega-event, which will make 9-11 look small, I predict, will be knocking the dominoes over.
[01:18:18.748 --> 01:18:20.048]  Starting the dominoes falling.
[01:18:21.494 --> 01:18:23.035]  And why do they want the tyranny?
[01:18:23.495 --> 01:18:27.357]  Not to just invade a bunch of countries, but to have a draft to make your kids do it.
[01:18:27.397 --> 01:18:33.999]  See, you talk about, well, if we're losing in Iraq, why does Bush want to go up against 65 million people instead of 20 million with more weapons?
[01:18:36.100 --> 01:18:41.963]  Well, because we, if we're under the control of the globals, can whoop Iran if we're willing to lose 500,000 troops.
[01:18:42.703 --> 01:18:44.844]  And believe me, a draft can supply those.
[01:18:46.045 --> 01:18:49.146]  And so they're trying to get us into a fight for our lives that we've got to win.
[01:18:50.156 --> 01:18:51.169]  It's real simple.
[01:18:54.503 --> 01:19:03.570]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as Triamethylenes, Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:19:03.810 --> 01:19:15.058]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:19:15.379 --> 01:19:21.103]  Nitrates, Nitrites, Radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are no problem.
[01:19:21.343 --> 01:19:27.989]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:19:28.209 --> 01:19:35.014]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:19:35.295 --> 01:19:37.076]  Supercharge your gravity filter today!
[01:19:37.336 --> 01:19:39.378]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.
[01:19:39.598 --> 01:19:41.300]  Get a 2-pack for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175.
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:42.180]  Call New Millennium at 888-
[01:19:45.503 --> 01:19:48.244]  803-4438, that's 888-803-4438, or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[01:19:48.264 --> 01:19:49.564]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[01:19:49.664 --> 01:19:50.284]  One and the same.
[01:19:50.324 --> 01:19:59.247]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%, in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:20:12.901 --> 01:20:16.022]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:20:16.282 --> 01:20:18.122]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:20:18.202 --> 01:20:21.203]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:20:21.743 --> 01:20:23.964]  Here is reality.
[01:20:24.344 --> 01:20:27.905]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:20:28.405 --> 01:20:32.066]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:20:32.626 --> 01:20:35.467]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[01:20:36.815 --> 01:20:40.517]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.
[01:20:40.898 --> 01:20:42.499]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:42.519 --> 01:20:44.880]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:54.967]  Gee, honey, those new sandals look great on you.
[01:20:55.167 --> 01:20:57.408]  And look, they show off my new toenails, too.
[01:20:57.708 --> 01:20:58.389]  New toenails?
[01:20:58.769 --> 01:20:59.750]  What happened to the old ones?
[01:21:00.730 --> 01:21:03.392]  Well, they're not really new, just clear and healthy looking.
[01:21:03.945 --> 01:21:05.366]  Remember how embarrassed I was?
[01:21:05.386 --> 01:21:08.169]  They were so discolored, really awful looking.
[01:21:08.389 --> 01:21:09.770]  Well, they sure look clear now.
[01:21:10.211 --> 01:21:11.892]  Gosh, I wish I could wear sandals again.
[01:21:12.053 --> 01:21:13.414]  My toenails are a disaster.
[01:21:13.454 --> 01:21:16.277]  Look, this one looks white, and that one's thick and yellow.
[01:21:16.477 --> 01:21:17.698]  Well, here's my secret.
[01:21:18.297 --> 01:21:19.318]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:21:19.819 --> 01:21:23.882]  It clears out yellowing keratin debris, the source of nail discoloration.
[01:21:24.583 --> 01:21:25.504]  Ah, so that's it.
[01:21:25.744 --> 01:21:28.286]  I've got ugly keratin debris built up under my nails.
[01:21:28.566 --> 01:21:30.208]  And Non-X Nail Gel gets rid of it.
[01:21:30.228 --> 01:21:33.731]  You'll need to use it every day, but clear nails are worth it.
[01:21:34.171 --> 01:21:34.711]  You bet!
[01:21:34.932 --> 01:21:39.034]  You know, when we go to the beach this summer, my toenails are going to look just as good as yours do.
[01:21:39.194 --> 01:21:40.715]  Thanks to Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:21:41.115 --> 01:21:42.236]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:21:42.416 --> 01:21:44.097]  For clear, healthy looking nails.
[01:21:44.457 --> 01:21:49.540]  Now at Walgreens, Rite Aid, Eckerd, Brooks, Long's, Duane Reade, and Walmart.
[01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:50.761]  In the foot care section.
[01:21:52.630 --> 01:21:55.131]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:55.151 --> 01:22:02.234]  Did you know that there is a concentration camp program that was designed during the Ronald Reagan administration called Rex 84?
[01:22:02.975 --> 01:22:08.197]  This program is designed to imprison anyone whom the federal government deems an enemy of the state.
[01:22:08.957 --> 01:22:20.702]  A judge in Houston, Texas declared that the plaintiff had proven that there was such a program that existed, but no one had been harmed or imprisoned by it, so he declared it unconstitutional and dismissed the case.

[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:30.180]  Welcome back, folks.
[01:23:31.821 --> 01:23:35.942]  Thanks for joining us for Genuine with wide open phones on this Friday.
[01:23:35.982 --> 01:23:38.463]  No guests, just your calls in the news.
[01:23:39.543 --> 01:23:41.444]  Let's go ahead and talk to Evan and Reno.
[01:23:41.904 --> 01:23:42.684]  Evan, you're on the air.
[01:23:42.744 --> 01:23:43.064]  Welcome.
[01:23:43.745 --> 01:23:45.165]  Alex, good afternoon.
[01:23:45.185 --> 01:23:47.126]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:23:48.123 --> 01:23:49.004]  How are you doing this afternoon?
[01:23:49.024 --> 01:23:49.684]  Can you hear me?
[01:23:49.944 --> 01:23:50.504]  I'm doing fine.
[01:23:50.524 --> 01:23:51.545]  I hear you loud and clear.
[01:23:52.105 --> 01:23:54.787]  Alright, I just called for a couple things.
[01:23:55.027 --> 01:24:01.630]  One, a few weeks back you put up an article from a blog, Police State High School.
[01:24:03.631 --> 01:24:04.572]  I called you about it.
[01:24:05.352 --> 01:24:05.632]  Yes.
[01:24:06.133 --> 01:24:09.254]  He actually put together a documentary that I think you should see.
[01:24:09.294 --> 01:24:10.675]  It's called, What is Fascism?
[01:24:11.616 --> 01:24:15.838]  He used a little bit of clips from your stuff, but he totally
[01:24:16.823 --> 01:24:18.043]  You did an awesome job on it.
[01:24:18.103 --> 01:24:19.224]  I think you would really like it.
[01:24:19.284 --> 01:24:21.144]  I'll send a link to the Timps on it.
[01:24:21.965 --> 01:24:27.947]  Yeah, send it to Timps at Infowarriors.com or send a link over to the MySpace account that we've set up.
[01:24:28.027 --> 01:24:34.589]  I think it's MySpace.com slash Alex underscore Infowarrior.
[01:24:34.829 --> 01:24:35.549]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:24:36.009 --> 01:24:37.970]  Yeah, I said I already got you on my top eight.
[01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:39.851]  Yeah, I'll send it there too, I guess.
[01:24:40.131 --> 01:24:46.433]  The other thing was this clip from Boston Legal.
[01:24:47.566 --> 01:24:48.807]  Of all shows.
[01:24:50.227 --> 01:24:51.288]  I'll send you a link to this.
[01:24:51.848 --> 01:24:52.888]  We played that yesterday.
[01:24:52.908 --> 01:24:54.089]  Did you?
[01:24:54.569 --> 01:24:54.849]  Yes.
[01:24:55.409 --> 01:24:57.630]  I must have missed it.
[01:24:57.990 --> 01:24:59.671]  It's totally amazing.
[01:24:59.711 --> 01:25:02.272]  I'm not mad at you, but do you have the radio on in the background?
[01:25:04.713 --> 01:25:09.635]  It really makes it hard to be able to talk to you guys and understand you and it really causes a problem.
[01:25:11.016 --> 01:25:12.656]  It must be my headphones.
[01:25:15.054 --> 01:25:16.514]  Internet stream's on, on the other end.
[01:25:16.635 --> 01:25:17.035]  Oh, okay.
[01:25:17.175 --> 01:25:18.395]  Okay, I just heard the show.
[01:25:19.195 --> 01:25:22.336]  Um, we've, uh, just a update on MySpace.
[01:25:22.376 --> 01:25:25.978]  We've, uh, there's been a lot of, uh, bulletin problems in the last couple days.
[01:25:26.018 --> 01:25:29.219]  Like, um, we've, we've maybe come up with some ideas.
[01:25:29.299 --> 01:25:34.260]  It might be, uh, people's, uh, I, uh, token IDs might be tagged.
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:37.661]  Like, usually when you repost a bulletin, you'll leave other people's names on it.
[01:25:38.421 --> 01:25:43.083]  And some, that might be cognitive problems, like certain names might be flagged, or certain IDs might be flagged.
[01:25:44.085 --> 01:25:47.588]  Yeah, for those who don't know, we're testing the reported censorship of MySpace.
[01:25:47.728 --> 01:25:57.775]  MySpace admits that they have computer programs that censor things critical of Murdoch and that they are out there censoring, but now so many people are criticizing.
[01:25:57.815 --> 01:26:04.640]  I think they may be backing off, at least for now, but we've caught them just this week deleting different 9-11 forums and other groups.
[01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:05.501]  Thanks for the call, sir.
[01:26:06.061 --> 01:26:10.505]  Let's talk to Lance in Ohio, or Lane, excuse me, Lane in Ohio.
[01:26:10.545 --> 01:26:11.185]  You're on the air.
[01:26:11.205 --> 01:26:12.386]  Hi, Alex.
[01:26:13.055 --> 01:26:14.075]  Hey, I got a couple questions.
[01:26:14.616 --> 01:26:14.896]  Yes.
[01:26:15.556 --> 01:26:26.140]  On Wednesday, you had a show and I didn't catch the whole thing, but I caught the end of it, and you had to finish off with the songs from a local band that you had in Austin that was playing anti-New World Order stuff.
[01:26:27.741 --> 01:26:28.061]  Yes, sir.
[01:26:28.101 --> 01:26:28.841]  What's your question?
[01:26:29.601 --> 01:26:34.203]  Basically, I didn't catch the whole show, so I was kind of wondering what their name was and if there's any way to... It's Cruiserweight.
[01:26:36.264 --> 01:26:43.427]  Like the boxing clash of fighter and just type that into a search engine and it will pop up for you.
[01:26:44.008 --> 01:26:55.514]  So another point, I was looking through the power hour this morning and they were making mention that something about in order for countries to purchase oil in the Arab states, they have to pay 40% of it in the euro.
[01:26:55.534 --> 01:26:56.294]  Have you heard anything about that?
[01:26:57.035 --> 01:26:59.576]  Yes, they are moving to a euro
[01:27:03.045 --> 01:27:15.795]  Controlled Petrodollar and a lot of other of the Arab countries are also dumping some of their cash reserves and moving part of their reserves into the Euro.
[01:27:16.255 --> 01:27:20.678]  Iran is moving entirely into the European Union denomination.
[01:27:21.919 --> 01:27:22.119]  All right.
[01:27:22.239 --> 01:27:22.719]  Thank you very much.
[01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:23.440]  Thank you.
[01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:25.221]  I appreciate the call.
[01:27:26.362 --> 01:27:28.424]  Who's up next after Lange?
[01:27:29.524 --> 01:27:30.385]  Lewis in Texas.
[01:27:30.425 --> 01:27:31.045]  You're on the air.
[01:27:31.086 --> 01:27:31.626]  Welcome, Lewis.
[01:27:33.933 --> 01:27:34.693]  What can I say, Alex?
[01:27:35.133 --> 01:27:35.594]  How you doing?
[01:27:35.914 --> 01:27:36.294]  Good, sir.
[01:27:36.554 --> 01:27:37.174]  Good, good.
[01:27:37.814 --> 01:27:42.516]  Uh, listen, I'm calling to try to expose some judicial tyranny in the wonderful state of Texas here.
[01:27:42.976 --> 01:27:43.496]  Oh, really?
[01:27:43.556 --> 01:27:44.417]  I don't believe that.
[01:27:44.437 --> 01:27:47.678]  Oh, well, we've got just such a wonderful and illustrious government.
[01:27:47.858 --> 01:27:49.518]  Uh, are you familiar with the Homestead Act?
[01:27:49.999 --> 01:27:50.279]  Yes.
[01:27:50.819 --> 01:27:55.721]  Uh, Article 16, Section 50 is the protection of, uh, the homestead as a state.
[01:27:56.741 --> 01:27:58.702]  Well, uh, I have a, uh, judge, uh,
[01:28:00.003 --> 01:28:09.269]  Lee G. Allworth of the 224th Judicial District Court, Montgomery County, Colorado, Texas, divests me of my right, title, and interest in a homestead.
[01:28:10.530 --> 01:28:11.811]  Yeah, they do that all the time.
[01:28:11.851 --> 01:28:13.452]  Doesn't matter what the state law says.
[01:28:13.492 --> 01:28:15.113]  They just say, law, what law?
[01:28:15.153 --> 01:28:16.694]  They do what Bush does every day.
[01:28:16.714 --> 01:28:23.079]  Notify all the, uh, uh, governor, congressman, attorney general, state commission, uh, senator,
[01:28:23.863 --> 01:28:24.964]  Uh, Secretary of State.
[01:28:24.984 --> 01:28:26.465]  Well, you just, you have to appeal that.
[01:28:26.485 --> 01:28:27.406]  You have to go above him.
[01:28:27.826 --> 01:28:31.790]  Went all the way, Bubba, and they, they, uh, registered certified return letters.
[01:28:31.830 --> 01:28:33.011]  They will not respond.
[01:28:33.791 --> 01:28:35.292]  What do you mean he went all the way?
[01:28:35.372 --> 01:28:38.335]  Well, basically notified every... So he's the highest judge?
[01:28:38.355 --> 01:28:39.216]  He's on the Supreme Court?
[01:28:39.976 --> 01:28:41.698]  No, he's a district judge.
[01:28:41.758 --> 01:28:42.698]  Well, just stay there.
[01:28:43.939 --> 01:28:44.900]  We're on the march.

[01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:02.523]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:02.903 --> 01:32:06.426]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:32:06.866 --> 01:32:10.930]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[01:32:11.490 --> 01:32:15.714]  And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire.
[01:32:21.599 --> 01:32:23.741]  Open line Friday, your chance to get involved.

[01:32:28.566 --> 01:32:28.786]  Going back...
[01:32:34.250 --> 01:32:35.411]  To Lewis in Texas.
[01:32:35.871 --> 01:32:51.857]  Lewis, for those that don't know what Homestead is, that's where for taxes, we got a state law passed many, many decades ago, and it's pretty much common law around the nation, that you can't take somebody's house if they file the Homestead exemption.
[01:32:52.538 --> 01:33:02.522]  But the government's such liars that about eight years ago on videotape at the County Commissioner's Court, I confronted the County Tax Assessor at the time, Nelda Wells Spears, I think she still is,
[01:33:03.388 --> 01:33:05.169]  And I said, why do you take people's houses?
[01:33:05.189 --> 01:33:11.814]  We've just gone out and interviewed a bunch of poor people and others and middle-class and elderly women, little two-bedroom houses, three-bedroom, whatever.
[01:33:12.394 --> 01:33:16.577]  And you didn't pay property taxes for a year, couldn't pay it, you know, had a heart attack, whatever.
[01:33:17.758 --> 01:33:20.920]  They come drag you out, throw your goods out on the front of the street, steal your house.
[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:23.121]  She said, we don't take people's houses!
[01:33:24.842 --> 01:33:30.286]  Then I cut to her and others a month before on the steps of the courthouse
[01:33:31.335 --> 01:33:34.778]  Auctioning people's houses off, people crying, saying, don't buy my house.
[01:33:35.538 --> 01:33:36.319]  Mainly old women.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:38.460]  They love it.
[01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:40.302]  They love attacking those widows.
[01:33:41.502 --> 01:33:42.363]  This is what they do.
[01:33:43.244 --> 01:33:45.005]  You don't own your house, just understand it.
[01:33:45.806 --> 01:33:49.228]  And it doesn't matter what state and federal law and common law says about homestead.
[01:33:49.748 --> 01:33:52.530]  These crooks just, look, they don't follow the law anymore.
[01:33:53.151 --> 01:34:00.056]  That's why I always tell all these patriot lawyers and people like that, I'm sure it's better to know the law and to fight and stand up and just be totally gullible.
[01:34:00.752 --> 01:34:02.693]  And they've even had national studies.
[01:34:03.453 --> 01:34:11.537]  I saw one on Fox News last year where they even admitted that pro se litigants have a higher success rate than barred lawyers.
[01:34:12.037 --> 01:34:13.237]  Lawyers are members of the bar.
[01:34:13.497 --> 01:34:15.418]  Accredited, licensed lawyers.
[01:34:16.659 --> 01:34:18.179]  Not just past the bar, members of it.
[01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:21.141]  And that's the facts.
[01:34:21.301 --> 01:34:25.422]  Because most of those guys are just there to milk you and make you lose because they're part of a club.
[01:34:26.483 --> 01:34:27.583]  And I'm sorry to have to tell you that.
[01:34:27.603 --> 01:34:29.024]  I mean, this is a criminal world.
[01:34:30.140 --> 01:34:31.141]  This is a criminal world.
[01:34:31.181 --> 01:34:33.342]  You don't have a real lawyer unless it's a family friend.
[01:34:33.382 --> 01:34:36.043]  And even then, it's hard for them to do the right thing.
[01:34:36.884 --> 01:34:40.766]  Or if it's somebody who is employed by your firm and your firm only, who you use.
[01:34:41.867 --> 01:34:44.048]  If you don't do that, you better just learn the law yourself.
[01:34:44.208 --> 01:34:46.089]  And then most lawyers are dumb as dirt as well.
[01:34:46.549 --> 01:34:48.110]  They're just lazy jokes.
[01:34:49.571 --> 01:34:52.452]  And frankly, a lot of people I know know more law than these people do.
[01:34:53.013 --> 01:34:54.974]  Most lawyers don't even know the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:34:54.994 --> 01:34:58.856]  They just practice some little special area of litigation for this or litigation for that.
[01:35:00.584 --> 01:35:02.005]  And, uh, yeah, they do it all the time.
[01:35:02.585 --> 01:35:03.426]  They do it all the time.
[01:35:03.486 --> 01:35:05.867]  But, uh, going back to, uh, Lewis.
[01:35:05.927 --> 01:35:06.547]  Lewis, go ahead.
[01:35:06.947 --> 01:35:12.330]  Yes, Alex, I have a newspaper article, a Cleveland Advocate, uh, Wednesday, March 18th, 1998.
[01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:17.052]  This is what happens when you petition government for redress of grievance.
[01:35:17.713 --> 01:35:20.674]  Uh, area man jail for threatening letter to judge.
[01:35:21.355 --> 01:35:25.837]  Uh, when I petitioned for redress of grievance, they tried to charge me with a, uh, uh,
[01:35:26.823 --> 01:35:27.444]  I don't doubt you.
[01:35:27.464 --> 01:35:29.005]  I mean, we've seen articles
[01:35:56.621 --> 01:36:00.863]  Uh, where, where... They sold the property and put the money in their pockets, Bill.
[01:36:01.263 --> 01:36:06.626]  They had a receiver sell the property without my consent and put the money in their pockets.
[01:36:07.106 --> 01:36:07.706]  I understand, sir.
[01:36:08.067 --> 01:36:11.868]  Yeah, it might be a $100,000 house and it's $5,000 in taxes and they keep it all.
[01:36:12.229 --> 01:36:13.309]  I understand the crookedness.
[01:36:13.809 --> 01:36:16.491]  I'm just picking an example out of a barrel.
[01:36:16.971 --> 01:36:23.614]  Because I said in one of my films, Police State 3 Total Enslavement, the fellow was in a wheelchair, a veteran, no criminal record,
[01:36:24.745 --> 01:36:29.106]  And they wanted his 44 acres up in Wisconsin for a prime development zone.
[01:36:29.146 --> 01:36:34.828]  Instead of buying it from him, he wouldn't sell it for less than best value or even tax value.
[01:36:34.848 --> 01:36:36.168]  They wanted to get him below that.
[01:36:37.028 --> 01:36:40.449]  And it was one of the big politician's brothers that was trying to force him to sell it.
[01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:42.850]  Well, he sued them over that.
[01:36:42.890 --> 01:36:44.190]  Just a mainstream lawsuit.
[01:36:44.891 --> 01:36:47.511]  They arrested him and gave him five years in prison.
[01:36:48.592 --> 01:36:50.312]  And it was a state case.
[01:36:50.352 --> 01:36:53.933]  The Attorney General of the state came in and said, we're asking for life in prison.
[01:36:54.730 --> 01:36:58.514]  And that was in the big papers, uh, there, reporting it as if it was normal.
[01:36:59.135 --> 01:37:07.825]  And then, of course, there's the cases where the guy puts a sign on his yard saying, our judicial system's a joke, so the judge says arrest him, and then the cops come without charges and put him in jail.
[01:37:08.525 --> 01:37:10.688]  Believe me, sir, I know, they have gone crazy.
[01:37:11.775 --> 01:37:23.982]  It's public record, it's case number 91040122CV and basically they can see it's on public record for this man, the man of his right and title of Homestead.
[01:37:24.782 --> 01:37:29.485]  They just blatantly do it in people's faces and they basically when they're called out
[01:37:30.445 --> 01:37:35.707]  I even put a banner on my van and went down to the courthouse, you know, stipulating what this judge had done.
[01:37:35.747 --> 01:37:41.349]  Well, when the people started questioning, they come up and arrested me for freedom of speech, exposing public record.
[01:37:41.389 --> 01:37:42.210]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:47.231]  Sir, how do you find justice in a country where you have no justice?
[01:37:47.332 --> 01:37:48.992]  Sir, I know, but listen, here's the good news.
[01:37:49.012 --> 01:37:49.933]  Let me give you the good news.
[01:37:51.473 --> 01:37:52.834]  They got big and fat, man.
[01:37:52.854 --> 01:37:53.354]  They're hungry.
[01:37:53.394 --> 01:37:54.654]  They're eating a lot of people now.
[01:37:54.674 --> 01:37:56.055]  They're not just gobbling on you.
[01:37:56.335 --> 01:37:58.796]  And they're making a lot of people mad.
[01:38:00.094 --> 01:38:05.858]  And you know, there's cops rolling their eyes, and it's going to happen to their cousin, it's going to happen to their daughter, it's going to happen to them when they're an old man.
[01:38:05.878 --> 01:38:11.381]  And see, there's all these people in the system now that are hearing you and they're going, that happened to my neighbor.
[01:38:12.088 --> 01:38:13.088]  They're telling the truth.
[01:38:13.148 --> 01:38:17.870]  Yeah, how do they, and then they're going to go look at the Homestead Law and go, how do judges do that without there being a law?
[01:38:17.890 --> 01:38:30.513]  They're going to go, wait a minute, the Supreme Court just said if a private interest wants your land, you know, back under the feudal system in England, if some lord or even one of his viceroys or minions or designates wanted your land, they'd just take it, no questions asked.
[01:38:30.533 --> 01:38:33.354]  See, we're going back under that again and I appreciate your call.
[01:38:34.254 --> 01:38:37.815]  And I know, you want to expose it, you want to show the evil, you want to point it out?
[01:38:40.289 --> 01:38:51.659]  But here's the good news, all these smiley face yuppies, they're going to get to pay $3,000 to $5,000 a year, depending on how much they drive, a minimum $3,000, business travelers $5,000 a drive.
[01:38:51.819 --> 01:38:59.126]  We're going to get to pay global taxes, we're going to get to live like slaves, brother.
[01:38:59.146 --> 01:39:07.573]  We're going to get forced on drugs, and forced into wars, and conscription, and all these people are going to get to enjoy being slaves.
[01:39:08.852 --> 01:39:24.378]  Just the outrage, the sorrow, the disheveled nature politically of being divested of freedom, getting to be shoved around, getting to go into captivity.
[01:39:28.159 --> 01:39:32.220]  And so many people that got fat off the system, they're going to be cut off too.
[01:39:34.101 --> 01:39:36.822]  So the once free, proud nation, the United States of America,
[01:39:37.623 --> 01:39:48.507]  Now to be a citadel of evil, a keep of darkness, a fortress of wickedness that issues forth radiation and genetic engineering and death and war and slaughter.
[01:39:50.667 --> 01:39:52.128]  And we all drink from the cup.
[01:39:52.168 --> 01:39:55.509]  Hey, I kind of commend Dick Cheney and George Bush and Bill Clinton and all of them.
[01:39:56.349 --> 01:39:59.610]  And Lord Rothschild and Lord Rockefeller and all of them.
[01:40:00.971 --> 01:40:04.052]  Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth, Saxe-Coburg-Gothis.
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:08.843]  That's power when their own subjects don't even know their name.
[01:40:09.483 --> 01:40:10.604]  Subjects don't even need to know our names.
[01:40:10.624 --> 01:40:11.545]  Just tell them we're Windsor.
[01:40:11.985 --> 01:40:12.366]  That'll work.
[01:40:14.127 --> 01:40:15.348]  They all breathe the DU2.
[01:40:18.531 --> 01:40:19.151]  They live here too.
[01:40:20.612 --> 01:40:23.275]  So you can't say they're not suffing from their own cup of death.
[01:40:24.696 --> 01:40:25.216]  But they know.
[01:40:25.236 --> 01:40:25.937]  See, they love death.
[01:40:27.678 --> 01:40:30.300]  And, uh, so that's what's happening.
[01:40:31.501 --> 01:40:33.523]  So enjoy, police officers who serve the system.
[01:40:33.543 --> 01:40:34.504]  Just roll down the window right now.
[01:40:35.780 --> 01:40:36.521]  There's nothing like DU.
[01:40:36.721 --> 01:40:37.301]  Oh, man.
[01:40:39.103 --> 01:40:47.089]  And again, when you're retching, dying in incredible pain, dying of lung cancer, with me and others, let's just all thank them.
[01:40:48.350 --> 01:40:49.230]  Just thank the system.
[01:40:50.191 --> 01:40:52.793]  Take your badge and kiss on it while you're dying.
[01:40:53.594 --> 01:41:00.599]  Could have had all those decades of life and enjoyment ahead of you, but you rolled your eyes, you loved George W. You loved Bill Clinton.
[01:41:01.201 --> 01:41:02.101]  You love the lies.
[01:41:02.121 --> 01:41:03.141]  You love your liberalness.
[01:41:03.161 --> 01:41:04.322]  You love your conservativeness.
[01:41:04.342 --> 01:41:06.262]  You love your phony false paradigm.
[01:41:06.282 --> 01:41:07.202]  You didn't want to wake up from it.
[01:41:07.382 --> 01:41:07.882]  So don't!
[01:41:08.063 --> 01:41:08.343]  Don't!
[01:41:08.503 --> 01:41:09.063]  Enjoy!
[01:41:09.823 --> 01:41:10.343]  Enjoy it!
[01:41:12.784 --> 01:41:18.865]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Susan in Omaha, Nebraska and John and others.
[01:41:19.645 --> 01:41:20.365]  Hi there, Alex.
[01:41:20.665 --> 01:41:21.025]  Hi.
[01:41:21.045 --> 01:41:23.606]  Hey, I want you to know how much I appreciate what you're doing.
[01:41:24.545 --> 01:41:26.045]  And never stop, okay?
[01:41:26.105 --> 01:41:26.666]  Well, thank you.
[01:41:26.766 --> 01:41:27.506]  I'll try not to.
[01:41:27.766 --> 01:41:28.546]  Okay.
[01:41:29.066 --> 01:41:40.189]  Moving right along, I wanted you to comment on the move of the Senate yesterday that voted to triple the public debt up to just shy of $9 trillion.
[01:41:40.889 --> 01:41:47.511]  And, you know, I cannot understand how even one senator could have cast a vote
[01:41:49.038 --> 01:41:56.162]  Well, the obligation is officially $87 trillion, and that number is about a year old.
[01:41:57.142 --> 01:42:07.927]  What we currently owe on the note, again, it's like you owe on a car for five years, and this week, this month, you owe $400, but on the total note of the car, you owe $30,000.
[01:42:08.367 --> 01:42:17.571]  So, this week, this month, we owe, currently, that we're in arrears, the $9 trillion.
[01:42:18.482 --> 01:42:18.862]  Okay.
[01:42:19.643 --> 01:42:21.745]  But we really owe $87 trillion.
[01:42:22.405 --> 01:42:28.090]  And to give you an idea of how much money that is, we're all a couple hundred thousand dollars in debt.
[01:42:28.690 --> 01:42:31.312]  And again, that's all fiat made in zeros and ones.
[01:42:31.632 --> 01:42:38.898]  The banking system set it up designed where it's impossible to not have, on average, people go into debt.
[01:42:39.198 --> 01:42:45.984]  And that's why we now have a lower debt versus savings ratio than at the bottom of the Depression in mid-year 1933.
[01:42:48.357 --> 01:42:51.398]  So we are in greater debt.
[01:42:52.138 --> 01:42:53.559]  Net, we are a debtor nation.
[01:42:55.179 --> 01:43:04.902]  And how does that impact our economic standing in the world, let's say, compared to China, Great Britain, Japan, Germany, France, etc.? ?
[01:43:09.863 --> 01:43:26.450]  We are the greatest debtor nation we've gone since 1982, as the greatest creditor nation, and the greatest manufacturing nation, to the most de-industrialized, hollowed-out husk, and now our entire infrastructure, with the dollars all these foreign countries own, they're dumping their dollars back in the U.S.
[01:43:26.490 --> 01:43:38.415]  right now, just worthless zeros and ones, they're dumping them back to buy the entire infrastructure, water, water treatment, power, roads, government hospitals,
[01:43:39.002 --> 01:43:39.702]  So, what I heard was
[01:44:04.137 --> 01:44:06.358]  Our children and our grandchildren will be in debt.
[01:44:06.438 --> 01:44:07.179]  I think it's a false debt.
[01:44:07.199 --> 01:44:08.219]  Well, it's a false debt, okay?
[01:44:08.239 --> 01:44:12.862]  I mean, if a loan shark gives you 500% interest on a daily basis, it isn't real.
[01:44:13.302 --> 01:44:15.943]  Especially if it's funny money they got out of a Cracker Jack box.
[01:44:16.463 --> 01:44:21.386]  The Federal Reserve System is designed to consolidate wealth, destroy free markets, and destroy America.
[01:44:23.467 --> 01:44:25.128]  Okay, I appreciate your comment on that.
[01:44:25.528 --> 01:44:25.828]  You bet.
[01:44:25.848 --> 01:44:26.968]  I appreciate you bringing it up.
[01:44:27.008 --> 01:44:27.649]  Yeah, I've got the
[01:44:28.915 --> 01:44:29.555]  Thank you for the call.
[01:44:29.575 --> 01:44:30.836]  I'm not trying to be negative here.
[01:44:30.876 --> 01:44:34.717]  When they do it to you, you understand they've systematically changed all the laws?
[01:44:34.957 --> 01:44:36.117]  You don't own your pension funds?
[01:44:36.797 --> 01:44:38.278]  And they're taking the money out of them right now?
[01:44:39.498 --> 01:44:40.678]  See, it's a Ponzi scheme.
[01:44:41.659 --> 01:44:42.759]  And it's designed to blow.
[01:44:43.279 --> 01:44:46.140]  But it's not just a Ponzi scheme where the crooks run off with the money.
[01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:49.721]  It's a Ponzi scheme where everybody goes belly up and they consolidate everything.
[01:44:50.976 --> 01:44:53.757]  Then they offer you the new surveillance police state economy.
[01:44:53.817 --> 01:45:05.402]  Okay, you want a job instead of it being like with Roosevelt where you go build dams or bridges or whatever and make work in work camps, which is bad enough, with the profits going to big money corporations.
[01:45:06.182 --> 01:45:09.343]  Now you just go in the military, you go into Homeland Security, you go into prisons.
[01:45:12.624 --> 01:45:14.125]  They're taking us for everything we are.
[01:45:14.485 --> 01:45:15.526]  They're taking us all the way.
[01:45:17.481 --> 01:45:19.803]  You want to live in a big, giant concentration camp?
[01:45:20.023 --> 01:45:24.906]  That's what America will be with all this RFID and these cameras and the rest of it and forced drugging.
[01:45:25.326 --> 01:45:26.948]  It's an insane asylum.
[01:45:28.629 --> 01:45:31.571]  You understand the President is signing bills that no one passed now?
[01:45:32.231 --> 01:45:34.172]  Stealing billions of dollars to give to his cronies.
[01:45:34.593 --> 01:45:35.573]  You didn't pass my bill?
[01:45:35.633 --> 01:45:36.294]  I'll just sign it.
[01:45:36.694 --> 01:45:37.975]  Oh, you're not going to pass my law?
[01:45:37.995 --> 01:45:38.796]  I'll just enforce it.
[01:45:39.156 --> 01:45:40.537]  You say it's illegal I'm doing this?
[01:45:40.557 --> 01:45:42.098]  Well, I'll just do it because I'm above the law.
[01:45:46.946 --> 01:45:48.546]  Everybody knows it's the 11th hour.
[01:45:52.007 --> 01:45:57.888]  But most of them are too busy running back to their liberals to save them, or running back to their conservatives to save them, when they're all bought off and paid for.
[01:45:57.948 --> 01:45:59.168]  John in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:45:59.908 --> 01:46:13.371]  Yes, I agree with what you just said, but I think that since there won't be much time, if you're going to make a comment about, or anybody makes a comment about an ideology or an organization, they should go to primary sources.
[01:46:13.411 --> 01:46:14.871]  They should go to the horse's mouth.
[01:46:15.359 --> 01:46:19.281]  They should check, for instance, if they want to know what socialist or Marxist say.
[01:46:19.641 --> 01:46:21.602]  Okay, John, I'm not going to waste my time with you.
[01:46:21.622 --> 01:46:24.323]  I've given you many times to repeat this over and over again.
[01:46:24.343 --> 01:46:25.584]  You call once a month saying this.
[01:46:25.604 --> 01:46:26.584]  Let me just tell you something right now.
[01:46:28.045 --> 01:46:29.445]  Our government funded Lenin.
[01:46:29.705 --> 01:46:30.386]  Period.
[01:46:30.626 --> 01:46:32.227]  The Rockefellers funded Stalin.
[01:46:32.587 --> 01:46:33.287]  Period.
[01:46:33.507 --> 01:46:40.530]  They propped up communism as a false, bipolar, political world system to build up a police state here domestically.
[01:46:40.931 --> 01:46:41.731]  Knock it off!
[01:46:44.819 --> 01:46:46.133]  I mean, John, are you denying it?
[01:46:48.012 --> 01:46:50.393]  I am denying it, yes, absolutely.
[01:46:50.633 --> 01:46:51.013]  Absolutely.
[01:46:51.053 --> 01:46:56.194]  This is the kind of nonsense that the John Birch Society, the neocons, the Nazis have fabricated.
[01:46:56.254 --> 01:46:59.195]  Hey, hey, John, John, the Nazis were National Socialists.
[01:46:59.235 --> 01:47:07.998]  Hey, John, did you know China, admittedly, I can go to the official Chinese Communist newspapers, they have 24 mobile execution vans in one city, buddy.
[01:47:08.338 --> 01:47:10.179]  They bash little babies' brains out.
[01:47:10.379 --> 01:47:13.800]  They get UN awards from US corporations for their policies.
[01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:14.920]  Do you deny it?
[01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:16.680]  You are on the side of the neocons.
[01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:19.561]  You are on the side of the military... You've got a religion!
[01:47:20.061 --> 01:47:23.602]  You've got a religion of worshipping the commies!
[01:47:24.383 --> 01:47:26.263]  Our government loves China!
[01:47:26.283 --> 01:47:29.604]  They give them all the nukes and give them all the jobs and give them everything!
[01:47:29.624 --> 01:47:30.664]  Don't worry!
[01:47:30.684 --> 01:47:32.485]  Your commies are gonna win, John!
[01:47:33.228 --> 01:47:33.809]  Go ahead!
[01:47:34.309 --> 01:47:37.953]  The whole PNAC plan is to bring us into war with China.
[01:47:38.193 --> 01:47:40.595]  That is why they're making war against Iraq and Iran.
[01:47:40.855 --> 01:47:42.537]  To have a boot on that spigot.
[01:47:42.777 --> 01:47:48.823]  To ultimately prevent any country, especially a rising economic country like China, from having access to it.
[01:47:49.003 --> 01:47:53.347]  Do you deny that China kills babies?
[01:47:54.268 --> 01:47:54.809]  I imagine...
[01:47:56.436 --> 01:47:58.957]  Possibly, but I believe that there's much fabrication.
[01:47:59.317 --> 01:48:10.019]  The kind of propaganda you're pushing was brought into this country by the Nazis, into the CIA, into Radio Free Europe, and it infiltrated the John Byrd Society.
[01:48:10.059 --> 01:48:11.559]  Sir, sir, sir, sir.
[01:48:12.679 --> 01:48:15.099]  I've had family that's been in Eastern European countries.
[01:48:15.199 --> 01:48:17.460]  Please don't tell me that the commies were wonderful.
[01:48:18.300 --> 01:48:19.440]  I mean, you've got to be kidding.
[01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:23.061]  Oh, but I know it was to beat the evil capitalists.
[01:48:23.101 --> 01:48:23.961]  They had to be evil.
[01:48:24.696 --> 01:48:26.596]  Do you deny that Lenin was funded by the British?
[01:48:27.117 --> 01:48:28.217]  Absolutely a lie.
[01:48:28.257 --> 01:48:29.777]  That's the Nazi propaganda.
[01:48:29.797 --> 01:48:34.398]  The kind of Ukrainian fabrications were copied by the Nazis.
[01:48:34.438 --> 01:48:37.039]  Check RationalRevolution.net.
[01:48:37.419 --> 01:48:40.200]  That kind of Nazi propaganda... Check what the commies say?
[01:48:40.220 --> 01:48:42.400]  Check what the Nazis say.
[01:48:42.420 --> 01:48:43.521]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:48:43.541 --> 01:48:52.163]  Do you support Fidel Castro's Minister of Sports at that game there in Puerto Rico, trying to tell that guy he couldn't have a sign saying, down with Fidel?
[01:48:53.436 --> 01:48:54.696]  It's probably a CIA agent.
[01:48:54.736 --> 01:48:56.097]  You know how these things operate.
[01:48:56.117 --> 01:48:56.397]  I don't care!
[01:48:56.417 --> 01:48:56.917]  I don't care!
[01:48:56.957 --> 01:48:58.297]  He's got free speech, buddy!
[01:48:58.677 --> 01:48:59.357]  You know what?
[01:48:59.397 --> 01:49:06.359]  The countries that attacked Cuba, such as the United States, have killed hundreds of thousands of people throughout Latin America.
[01:49:06.399 --> 01:49:07.619]  None of that goes on in Cuba.
[01:49:07.939 --> 01:49:13.700]  Cuba has been one of the leading forces against the New World Order long before you were even talking about it.
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:15.841]  We're going to be led into another
[01:49:17.711 --> 01:49:21.352]  The Cold War that is going to bring us to war with China and North Korea.
[01:49:21.372 --> 01:49:26.053]  They're going to reactivate the neocons, their own anti-communist propaganda.
[01:49:26.073 --> 01:49:27.693]  I disagree with you.
[01:49:27.753 --> 01:49:29.834]  I disagree with you, John, and I appreciate your call.
[01:49:29.874 --> 01:49:30.954]  I'll comment on it when we get back.
[01:49:30.974 --> 01:49:33.795]  I had that debate about once a month.
[01:49:33.815 --> 01:49:34.655]  Well, he got mad.
[01:49:34.675 --> 01:49:40.076]  It's like I was telling him... It's like telling a Christian that Jesus is bad.
[01:49:40.136 --> 01:49:40.816]  I mean, boy!
[01:49:41.317 --> 01:49:41.477]  Ha!
[01:49:41.597 --> 01:49:41.777]  Ha!
[01:49:42.917 --> 01:49:44.617]  There's no helping us with people like that.
[01:49:44.637 --> 01:49:45.898]  They just cannot get it.
[01:49:45.958 --> 01:49:47.118]  They will not get it.
[01:49:48.514 --> 01:49:49.714]  Oh, police.
[01:49:50.635 --> 01:49:52.235]  Nauseating.
[01:49:53.935 --> 01:49:56.776]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:57.056 --> 01:49:58.616]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:58.976 --> 01:50:03.637]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:03.977 --> 01:50:10.699]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:11.039 --> 01:50:13.020]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:50:13.220 --> 01:50:16.081]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:16.161 --> 01:50:20.823]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:21.024 --> 01:50:25.426]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:25.666 --> 01:50:32.909]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:50:53.419 --> 01:50:55.040]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:50:55.160 --> 01:50:59.302]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:50:59.402 --> 01:51:02.284]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:51:02.364 --> 01:51:09.087]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:51:09.267 --> 01:51:12.269]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:51:12.489 --> 01:51:14.870]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:51:14.991 --> 01:51:19.633]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[01:51:19.673 --> 01:51:20.594]  We're good to go!
[01:51:49.833 --> 01:51:50.394]  I think so.
[01:52:09.995 --> 01:52:10.656]  We're good to go.

[01:53:04.538 --> 01:53:05.459]  George Orwell.
[01:53:07.139 --> 01:53:08.400]  Eric Blair was his real name.
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:10.181]  Grew up in India.
[01:53:11.822 --> 01:53:13.582]  Became one of the imperial policemen.
[01:53:14.623 --> 01:53:16.284]  Carried out executions, you name it.
[01:53:17.064 --> 01:53:19.345]  Then he became an anti-imperialist.
[01:53:19.385 --> 01:53:20.405]  Went and joined the communists.
[01:53:20.425 --> 01:53:21.446]  Was shot in the neck.
[01:53:22.246 --> 01:53:24.707]  Fought against the Franco-fascists in Spain.
[01:53:26.468 --> 01:53:32.451]  And then you read in the book he wrote about that how the communists were always killing each other and backstabbing and just a pack of criminals.
[01:53:33.402 --> 01:53:41.266]  And then he went and worked for the BBC in propaganda against Hitler and found out that they were basically funding Hitler and really had engineered the whole thing.
[01:53:41.847 --> 01:53:45.909]  So he wrote in 1984 describing what a communist dictatorship would be like.
[01:53:49.571 --> 01:54:00.036]  And, you know, when you sit there and you try to explain to people that, let's say you live in a little village in between two major countries in Yar.
[01:54:00.457 --> 01:54:01.237]  This is hypothetical.
[01:54:02.492 --> 01:54:04.013]  And both those countries were evil.
[01:54:05.873 --> 01:54:06.273]  You see?
[01:54:07.134 --> 01:54:10.475]  Well no, you're going to pick one that you're going to try to join with and claim the other's evil.
[01:54:12.815 --> 01:54:16.637]  Just because I'm against attacking China doesn't mean that China's good.
[01:54:18.077 --> 01:54:22.879]  But see, oh, we have to shut down the free speech of the person with a sign saying, Down with Fidel.
[01:54:24.599 --> 01:54:25.860]  Because it's evil CIA.
[01:54:27.515 --> 01:54:31.156]  But then, meanwhile, George Bush is trying to shut down signs criticizing him.
[01:54:31.176 --> 01:54:32.317]  Oh, but that's bad.
[01:54:34.337 --> 01:54:40.239]  And that's how they got men, young men, special forces men, to go carry out bombings all over Europe to blame it on communists.
[01:54:40.319 --> 01:54:42.800]  Men, you know the commies are killing millions of people.
[01:54:43.140 --> 01:54:45.301]  We've got to do this to stop them from bringing down Italy.
[01:54:45.621 --> 01:54:47.121]  If they bring it down, they'll kill millions.
[01:54:47.461 --> 01:54:49.522]  You'll kill a few hundred to save a few million.
[01:54:50.672 --> 01:54:53.674]  And they told communists that, we're going to do this to blame it on our enemy.
[01:54:54.074 --> 01:54:58.076]  And then basically the globalists are running both sides like hand puppets.
[01:54:58.997 --> 01:55:01.979]  And really the exercise is conditioning people to be evil.
[01:55:03.460 --> 01:55:07.502]  We've got to torture people's children to get answers or they'll hit us with the anthrax.
[01:55:08.863 --> 01:55:11.064]  White House lawyers say it, 24 says it.
[01:55:11.524 --> 01:55:13.125]  You see, we're all being conditioned.
[01:55:15.087 --> 01:55:17.428]  And it's true that the Bush's funded Hitler.
[01:55:19.665 --> 01:55:21.487]  And we're involved with him and worked for him.
[01:55:22.528 --> 01:55:23.068]  That's admitted.
[01:55:23.108 --> 01:55:24.089]  He classified public.
[01:55:24.409 --> 01:55:24.870]  Mainstream.
[01:55:25.130 --> 01:55:26.211]  In my film, Order of Death.
[01:55:27.232 --> 01:55:28.673]  In my film, Martial Law.
[01:55:28.793 --> 01:55:29.674]  They both get into it a little bit.
[01:55:29.894 --> 01:55:31.095]  Martial Law more than Order of Death.
[01:55:33.137 --> 01:55:34.278]  And we prove that.
[01:55:34.658 --> 01:55:36.640]  And we prove that then they went as U.S.
[01:55:36.700 --> 01:55:41.984]  Ambassador to China with Kissinger and opened it up and that David Rockefeller has funded communists in this country.
[01:55:42.565 --> 01:55:43.225]  That's a fact.
[01:55:43.906 --> 01:55:45.187]  Not propaganda, brother.
[01:55:45.207 --> 01:55:47.229]  I've done the original deep research.
[01:55:48.570 --> 01:55:59.617]  Then they go in and they open up China and the big corporations, who are not free market, make a mercantile deal to get China and its brass, its military, to de-industrialize the U.S.
[01:56:00.078 --> 01:56:07.362]  And now they're going to have another fake fight with China like they had with the former Soviets, while the Pentagon really picks off the third world countries that can't defend themselves.
[01:56:10.464 --> 01:56:11.185]  You know, the U.N.
[01:56:11.225 --> 01:56:13.386]  was founded by the military-industrial complex.
[01:56:16.568 --> 01:56:16.968]  Founded.
[01:56:17.249 --> 01:56:17.869]  At the Presidio.
[01:56:18.709 --> 01:56:19.410]  By communists.
[01:56:19.990 --> 01:56:21.111]  With the Pentagon's approval.
[01:56:21.131 --> 01:56:22.592]  Now, do you think those are real communists?
[01:56:22.612 --> 01:56:23.772]  Do you think that even really exists?
[01:56:23.832 --> 01:56:24.032]  No.
[01:56:24.593 --> 01:56:26.634]  They're little commie icons or government agents.
[01:56:27.395 --> 01:56:39.462]  It's what Terrell Quigley, the head of Georgetown's political science department, Bill Clinton's mentor, who he thanked in his first State of the Union address, the man that shaped him, wrote a 900-page book saying, We control the communists!
[01:56:39.742 --> 01:56:41.223]  We control the capitalists!
[01:56:41.443 --> 01:56:42.744]  We control America!
[01:56:43.004 --> 01:56:44.205]  We control Russia!
[01:56:44.445 --> 01:56:45.346]  We stage it!
[01:56:47.262 --> 01:56:51.245]  And he said, my only disagreement with the globalists, who I'm part of, is that we haven't gone public.
[01:56:51.345 --> 01:56:52.325]  I think we can go public.
[01:56:52.345 --> 01:56:53.346]  And now they have gone public.
[01:56:54.487 --> 01:57:00.911]  And you're so set in your ways with your little commie friends down at the coffee shop, thinking you're trendy, that you can't get it.
[01:57:01.131 --> 01:57:05.534]  Hey man, every time I see a pack of communists, you're telling me how I should turn my gun in!
[01:57:06.555 --> 01:57:08.696]  Oh yeah, the government's tyrannical and evil.
[01:57:08.916 --> 01:57:10.757]  Here, let me turn my guns in.
[01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:16.381]  You make me sick.
[01:57:17.737 --> 01:57:19.279]  Just like neocons make me sick.
[01:57:19.619 --> 01:57:21.461]  And you call me a neocon.
[01:57:22.902 --> 01:57:25.405]  Just keep wallowing in your false paradigm.
[01:57:25.445 --> 01:57:26.966]  You're just like the Bush followers.
[01:57:27.547 --> 01:57:29.348]  You're just like all the dumb liberals.
[01:57:29.989 --> 01:57:31.330]  There's no helping you.
[01:57:33.613 --> 01:57:38.517]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:50.012 --> 01:57:50.652]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.313 --> 01:57:52.373]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.094 --> 01:57:54.194]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.835 --> 01:57:55.675]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.416 --> 01:57:57.296]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.336 --> 01:58:01.699]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.159 --> 01:58:06.302]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.643 --> 01:58:13.206]  Continuing with wide-open phones, you the listeners, bringing up all sorts of important issues and topics in the page.
[01:58:13.226 --> 01:58:16.948]  If you disagree with me, you go to the head of the line.
[01:58:16.988 --> 01:58:17.809]  John disagreed.
[01:58:19.102 --> 01:58:25.589]  I don't believe he told the person answering the phones that or he would have gone to the head of the line.
[01:58:25.609 --> 01:58:26.210]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:26.230 --> 01:58:33.098]  Unlike Fidel Castro, I don't try to stop people who disagree with me.
[01:58:34.459 --> 01:58:39.185]  I think there's four or five people that are banned from this show or categorized as stalkers.
[01:58:41.109 --> 01:58:42.129]  More false witness.
[01:58:42.430 --> 01:58:43.730]  Why I attacked my family.
[01:58:43.750 --> 01:58:45.912]  In some cases, tried physical actions.
[01:58:45.932 --> 01:58:48.514]  Of course, when I hear their little sniveling voices, they're not on.
[01:58:48.534 --> 01:58:51.135]  But you're a testament to that, listeners.
[01:58:51.175 --> 01:58:54.758]  You know that we don't screen your calls.
[01:58:54.778 --> 01:58:56.179]  We ask first name, where you're calling from.
[01:58:56.819 --> 01:58:59.381]  Every once in a while, we'd like to know if you're listening on AM, FM, shortwave internet.
[01:58:59.401 --> 01:59:00.442]  If you want to tell us that, it's fine.
[01:59:00.842 --> 01:59:01.703]  We'll get you up on air.
[01:59:01.723 --> 01:59:01.783]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:59:01.923 --> 01:59:02.963]  Really scary articles here.
[01:59:08.090 --> 01:59:12.653]  New Orleans admits to Second Amendment Foundation attorneys that they have seized guns.
[01:59:14.134 --> 01:59:17.876]  First they announced it and did it, then tried to deny it, and now they admit it.
[01:59:17.916 --> 01:59:18.957]  Big stockpiles of them.
[01:59:21.438 --> 01:59:22.419]  So we'll get into some of that.
[01:59:23.319 --> 01:59:27.001]  Also, Paul Craig Roberts wrote a big piece about, you know, will Bush carry out another 9-11.
[01:59:27.021 --> 01:59:28.962]  But right now,
[01:59:36.238 --> 01:59:41.399]  Let me just go ahead and go back to your calls, and then later I'm going to continue talking about the subject of communism.
[01:59:42.979 --> 01:59:44.620]  I guess the long and short of it is this.
[01:59:47.440 --> 02:00:00.243]  Big corporations lobby governments to actually raise taxes so that there can be increased amounts of monies to be paid in corporate welfare and corporate largesse, crony capitalism,
[02:00:01.098 --> 02:00:01.638]  To them.
[02:00:02.118 --> 02:00:05.679]  They are the chief lobbyists for big government and what you call socialism.
[02:00:05.739 --> 02:00:10.960]  Socialism is fleecing the middle class and the working class and paying it into elite coffers.
[02:00:11.980 --> 02:00:15.061]  And that's why the big corporations fund socialism and communism.
[02:00:15.101 --> 02:00:22.182]  And you can't tell somebody like John that, because his very handlers that have been brainwashing him for 30, 40 years, are on the payroll.
[02:00:23.523 --> 02:00:24.543]  So have fun, Bubba!
[02:00:26.283 --> 02:00:28.444]  Big government is for the elite, not for the people.
[02:00:28.824 --> 02:00:29.644]  Figure it out!
[02:00:30.945 --> 02:00:32.546]  You can't have tyranny without a big government.
[02:00:33.746 --> 02:00:36.768]  And tyranny and big government is just a mechanism of the elite.
[02:00:38.148 --> 02:00:40.369]  Let's go to John in New York, then James, Drew, and others.
[02:00:40.389 --> 02:00:41.009]  Go ahead, John.
[02:00:41.990 --> 02:00:46.752]  That guy, he must have his finger in a light socket or something all the time.
[02:00:47.512 --> 02:00:53.455]  I call about two things that I saw creepers go across the bottom of the TV when I was watching the news.
[02:00:54.232 --> 02:00:54.653]  Sure, what is it?
[02:01:04.421 --> 02:01:06.742]  F-16s have been moved to the Middle East.
[02:01:06.842 --> 02:01:09.582]  Now that thing happened about a month ago.
[02:01:09.762 --> 02:01:11.603]  Yeah, I was going to say six, eight weeks ago.
[02:01:11.663 --> 02:01:12.563]  That's true.
[02:01:13.504 --> 02:01:14.684]  Ships full of Marines.
[02:01:15.144 --> 02:01:21.966]  They're beefing the troops from 140,000 to 180,000 in Iraq, right in the Basra area for an invasion of the western area.
[02:01:22.386 --> 02:01:29.008]  The second thing I saw happen last night, and again I looked this morning and I listened in the news and saw nothing, was that the
[02:01:31.411 --> 02:01:41.657]  The Defense Department has given Lockheed Martin half a billion dollars to set up a database for the FBI.
[02:01:42.818 --> 02:01:43.699]  Yes, I saw that.
[02:01:43.799 --> 02:01:45.520]  Lots of databases on citizens.
[02:01:46.220 --> 02:01:51.863]  And I have countless examples of funding for the boys over in Russia.
[02:01:52.083 --> 02:01:53.744]  I'd love to give them, if you've got time.
[02:01:53.764 --> 02:01:54.585]  Yeah, sure, go ahead.
[02:01:55.045 --> 02:01:59.948]  Well, Jacob Schiff gave Trotsky $25 million to go and join Lenin.
[02:02:02.258 --> 02:02:06.199]  That was back before, obviously before the revolution.
[02:02:07.339 --> 02:02:19.864]  The second thing I would offer is that Roosevelt, President Roosevelt, recognized the Soviet Union as a legitimate country and therefore they were eligible for international loans.
[02:02:21.305 --> 02:02:27.727]  The Russians, after World War II, gave all the munitions that they captured from the Japanese to Mao Zedong,
[02:02:28.573 --> 02:02:36.882]  And George C. Marshall bragged about disarming the Nationalists by not letting the weapons that the Nationalists had paid for get delivered.
[02:02:36.902 --> 02:02:37.263]  Stay there.
[02:02:37.303 --> 02:02:43.689]  And then I saw the CIA section chief on History Channel about five years ago admit all that and I fell out of my chair.
[02:02:43.709 --> 02:02:44.030]  Stay there.
[02:02:46.425 --> 02:02:53.809]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:02:54.069 --> 02:02:58.812]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:02:59.032 --> 02:03:04.675]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:03:04.915 --> 02:03:09.436]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:03:09.716 --> 02:03:16.799]  Attached was society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign creeps massing on U.S.
[02:03:16.819 --> 02:03:21.360]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.540 --> 02:03:24.041]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:03:24.281 --> 02:03:30.983]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:03:31.223 --> 02:03:36.485]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.

[02:03:45.794 --> 02:03:48.655]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:03:49.015 --> 02:03:51.895]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:03:52.115 --> 02:03:58.317]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[02:05:49.938 --> 02:05:50.578]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.258 --> 02:05:52.319]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.019 --> 02:05:54.140]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.780 --> 02:05:55.621]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.361 --> 02:05:57.241]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.261 --> 02:06:01.843]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.104 --> 02:06:06.245]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:07.106 --> 02:06:10.287]  Okay, we had a caller at the end of the last hour.
[02:06:10.367 --> 02:06:11.968]  John from Ohio.
[02:06:12.628 --> 02:06:13.509]  Calls for chain-link.
[02:06:14.907 --> 02:06:17.049]  And he's got the blind spot, just like conservatives.
[02:06:17.069 --> 02:06:21.493]  You tell them Bush is anti-gun, pro-border, they go, no he isn't, it's a lie, lie.
[02:06:21.833 --> 02:06:23.855]  Call me lie, call me lie!
[02:06:25.956 --> 02:06:32.022]  And I started telling John that his Holy Grail was a fraud, and that big banks in London and the U.S.
[02:06:32.082 --> 02:06:41.189]  openly funded the Soviets, and that the big, rich elite, I mean, there are a whole bunch of industrialists and robber barons who wrote books saying they liked communism.
[02:06:41.229 --> 02:06:43.171]  I mean, what are you, what is he talking about?
[02:06:44.964 --> 02:06:50.746]  And then they form that into a false bipolar debate of fascism versus socialism, when both of them are command and control.
[02:06:52.207 --> 02:06:56.008]  Again, big corporations, 44 of the 100 biggest economies.
[02:06:56.649 --> 02:07:00.370]  We'll go back to John of New Yorker in a second, who was countering John from Ohio, eloquently.
[02:07:01.691 --> 02:07:02.411]  And you know what, John?
[02:07:02.451 --> 02:07:03.751]  I don't want to just sit here and attack you.
[02:07:03.791 --> 02:07:07.653]  If we've got any open phones, since this is continuing now, call back in.
[02:07:07.673 --> 02:07:07.733]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:07:07.753 --> 02:07:08.953]  If you've ever had a stroke in anger,
[02:07:13.368 --> 02:07:16.731]  You're welcome to call back in.
[02:07:16.751 --> 02:07:23.616]  1-800-259-9231 or anybody else that wants to defend communism and thinks it's trendy because the iron fist and the red flags are so cool.
[02:07:25.838 --> 02:07:31.823]  But big corporations openly, and I've seen it, I know what their foundations do, I've read the Carnegie Endowment Minutes.
[02:07:31.923 --> 02:07:33.524]  I mean, this is what goes on.
[02:07:33.564 --> 02:07:34.665]  This is not my opinion.
[02:07:34.685 --> 02:07:35.586]  This is what I do.
[02:07:38.448 --> 02:07:40.770]  They lobby for socialization.
[02:07:41.698 --> 02:07:45.600]  They lobby to take more of our money, more of our tax money.
[02:07:46.981 --> 02:07:53.944]  And look at how the tax structure is set up, where when you make over about $2 million a year, you drop into about a 25% tax bracket.
[02:07:54.744 --> 02:08:03.709]  But if you're making $300,000, $400,000, $500,000, I mean real middle class, you're hiring people, you're spending money, you're the perfect type of person for the economy.
[02:08:05.029 --> 02:08:05.430]  Perfect!
[02:08:06.950 --> 02:08:10.512]  Most of your money you spend on consuming, and on developing.
[02:08:11.303 --> 02:08:11.903]  And on hiring.
[02:08:12.204 --> 02:08:12.944]  Small businesses.
[02:08:14.505 --> 02:08:16.186]  You're in the highest tax bracket of 40%.
[02:08:16.447 --> 02:08:19.649]  And you get hit by all these other taxes.
[02:08:20.890 --> 02:08:22.130]  That's how this is set up.
[02:08:23.651 --> 02:08:26.233]  And, I mean, I sat there on the History Channel.
[02:08:26.253 --> 02:08:27.054]  They were so proud of it.
[02:08:28.295 --> 02:08:34.479]  And I watched the CIA Section Chief from 1949 to 1951 say, we were always for Mao.
[02:08:34.899 --> 02:08:36.020]  We helped get him the weapons.
[02:08:36.600 --> 02:08:38.081]  We didn't want the Nationalists to have it.
[02:08:38.141 --> 02:08:40.303]  We thought they would be more stable.
[02:08:41.630 --> 02:08:43.532]  And now this is declassified and I can tell you.
[02:08:43.552 --> 02:08:45.273]  It was like some 85-year-old man.
[02:08:45.313 --> 02:08:45.874]  I forget his name.
[02:08:45.914 --> 02:08:46.635]  I could go look it up.
[02:08:47.816 --> 02:08:48.636]  And I'd already read that.
[02:08:48.656 --> 02:08:49.457]  I'd already read U.S.
[02:08:49.497 --> 02:08:50.498]  government documents.
[02:08:50.798 --> 02:08:51.619]  These are official.
[02:08:51.639 --> 02:08:55.543]  I already knew what the caller mentioned about Marshall and others.
[02:08:57.504 --> 02:09:07.133]  And now, I mean, the official Chinese party admits that 60 million, I'd always said 50 million, died in the Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forward.
[02:09:11.289 --> 02:09:12.850]  And, you know, that's serious.
[02:09:13.270 --> 02:09:19.073]  I mean, you can type in public execution China in the search engine, you'll see stuff I can't even mention on air.
[02:09:21.374 --> 02:09:22.895]  I mean, I have family who's worked in China.
[02:09:22.915 --> 02:09:24.116]  I know people who are there right now.
[02:09:24.176 --> 02:09:24.936]  We have listeners there.
[02:09:25.256 --> 02:09:27.677]  Man, they have sports stadium executions every week.
[02:09:27.858 --> 02:09:29.038]  They have mobile execution vans.
[02:09:29.218 --> 02:09:30.139]  They do kill babies.
[02:09:30.319 --> 02:09:33.300]  They do get UN awards for it, for killing already born babies.
[02:09:33.340 --> 02:09:34.661]  They do have forced abortion.
[02:09:35.982 --> 02:09:38.483]  Oh, I know, liberty of the state to rip babies out of wombs.
[02:09:40.496 --> 02:09:41.777]  And the globalists love it.
[02:09:41.857 --> 02:09:42.637]  They love it.
[02:09:42.717 --> 02:09:44.198]  They fund dictators.
[02:09:44.238 --> 02:09:45.439]  They fund thugs.
[02:09:45.479 --> 02:09:46.960]  They prop them up in the Middle East.
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:48.121]  They prop them up in Germany.
[02:09:48.161 --> 02:09:48.901]  They prop them up.
[02:09:49.322 --> 02:09:51.083]  They give a billion bucks to Ho Chi Minh.
[02:09:52.464 --> 02:09:53.564]  They stage that thing.
[02:09:56.866 --> 02:09:58.627]  And people just can't get that.
[02:09:58.667 --> 02:10:01.129]  They can't get that the globalists want to lose in Iraq.
[02:10:01.449 --> 02:10:03.570]  At least for what they claim they want to do.
[02:10:03.730 --> 02:10:04.371]  Get the water on.
[02:10:04.391 --> 02:10:05.151]  Get the power on.
[02:10:05.191 --> 02:10:06.172]  Get out of there in six months.
[02:10:06.432 --> 02:10:08.634]  We promise troops you'll be home in time for Christmas.
[02:10:08.674 --> 02:10:09.134]  We swear.
[02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:15.582]  Official PNAC documents, which don't shoot your mouth off to meet John from Ohio.
[02:10:15.642 --> 02:10:16.102]  I've read them.
[02:10:16.382 --> 02:10:17.903]  I've read thousands of pages of it.
[02:10:18.223 --> 02:10:21.284]  I'll be, I'm not going to a birthday party tonight of family.
[02:10:21.824 --> 02:10:24.645]  I'm going to be here at one in the morning.
[02:10:26.546 --> 02:10:27.587]  Working on just that.
[02:10:27.827 --> 02:10:29.007]  It makes it sick.
[02:10:30.648 --> 02:10:31.248]  Makes me sick.
[02:10:34.750 --> 02:10:36.771]  And they say, we want to be there for decades.
[02:10:36.791 --> 02:10:38.631]  We want the long war.
[02:10:38.731 --> 02:10:42.593]  We want civil war and a total breakdown as a pretext to stay.
[02:10:42.893 --> 02:10:43.833]  They say it!
[02:10:45.414 --> 02:10:48.015]  Israel's battle plan said it, advising the U.S.
[02:10:48.635 --> 02:10:49.375]  It's public!
[02:10:51.916 --> 02:10:56.358]  Do the defense contractors make more money if we're there 20 years, or if we're there a year?
[02:10:56.438 --> 02:10:57.738]  Come on, you know the answer.
[02:10:58.098 --> 02:10:59.479]  You don't need to be told the answer.
[02:11:03.081 --> 02:11:07.124]  Now, I want you to be able to restate, John, in New York, what you were saying, the facts.
[02:11:08.145 --> 02:11:17.451]  I remember David Rockefeller, when Mao died, it's in my book, in the New York Times, saying he was an incredible person, did a great job, a great stabilizing factor, same thing the CIA section chief said.
[02:11:17.471 --> 02:11:24.236]  He's so wonderful, blah, blah, blah, because Rockefeller got to go in there with all his dibs on the first big companies that were set up there.
[02:11:24.276 --> 02:11:26.218]  They loved slavery, as Carol Quigley said.
[02:11:26.718 --> 02:11:27.459]  He believed in it.
[02:11:27.639 --> 02:11:29.360]  He was one of their top strategists.
[02:11:30.265 --> 02:11:30.966]  Statisticians!
[02:11:31.306 --> 02:11:31.826]  He said it!
[02:11:32.067 --> 02:11:33.007]  I mean, they say it!
[02:11:33.248 --> 02:11:34.849]  Source documents say it!
[02:11:34.989 --> 02:11:38.112]  Don't give me your, oh, you're a Nazi neocon!
[02:11:38.532 --> 02:11:42.856]  How dare you, John, from Ohio, who we've got back on the line, going back to in a few minutes!
[02:11:43.076 --> 02:11:44.457]  How dare you indict me!
[02:11:45.598 --> 02:11:48.120]  How dare you lie about me!
[02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:49.761]  How dare you use slogans!
[02:11:49.801 --> 02:11:56.287]  Your little fallback on the little commie slogans they taught you in the 60's on the university when you were being CIA controlled!
[02:11:56.687 --> 02:11:57.268]  You fool!
[02:11:58.294 --> 02:12:01.656]  Now go back to John in New York, then we'll go back to the Commissar.
[02:12:02.877 --> 02:12:10.561]  With regard to the Vietnam War, the only seaport in North Vietnam was never bombed until Richard Nixon's second term.
[02:12:11.342 --> 02:12:17.546]  So all the munitions and all the anti-aircraft missiles and artillery that went in there shot down all those planes.
[02:12:18.266 --> 02:12:22.869]  They can weigh all that right on the rules of engagement that came out of the Pentagon.
[02:12:23.510 --> 02:12:24.871]  But there's three quotes I'd like.
[02:12:24.911 --> 02:12:26.193]  More facts.
[02:12:26.213 --> 02:12:31.018]  I want you to go back for stations that don't carry that first five-minute segment, which they should, but it's okay if they don't.
[02:12:31.318 --> 02:12:33.660]  Repeat what you said when you first got on, because it's all true.
[02:12:34.121 --> 02:12:34.481]  Okay.
[02:12:35.923 --> 02:12:45.813]  First of all, Lenin was smuggled through Germany in a railroad car with a lot of money from the bankers, and at the same time, Trotsky was sent by ship
[02:12:46.423 --> 02:12:52.186]  And he was funded by Jacob Schiff, a banker out of New York City with $25 million.
[02:12:52.627 --> 02:12:55.308]  And everybody knows the British were against their cousins.
[02:12:55.909 --> 02:12:58.010]  The king and the czar were identical.
[02:12:58.050 --> 02:12:59.131]  You couldn't tell them apart.
[02:12:59.471 --> 02:13:02.072]  That was the incredible crossbreeding within the same family.
[02:13:02.473 --> 02:13:04.874]  Both hemophiliacs, both complete lunatics.
[02:13:05.534 --> 02:13:08.156]  And they openly were trying to knock off their cousins.
[02:13:08.216 --> 02:13:09.977]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:13:10.217 --> 02:13:13.779]  And then President Roosevelt, around 1933,
[02:13:15.445 --> 02:13:26.350]  Uh, recognized the Soviet Union as a legitimate country and therefore made them eligible for international loans, so that bailed out Communist Russia.
[02:13:27.326 --> 02:13:30.709]  And throughout the entire first half of the 20th century.
[02:13:30.749 --> 02:13:32.390]  He was Uncle Joe!
[02:13:32.491 --> 02:13:32.991]  That's right!
[02:13:33.051 --> 02:13:34.172]  During World War II!
[02:13:34.312 --> 02:13:37.394]  Saturday evening post images of him with a child on his lap.
[02:13:37.434 --> 02:13:38.175]  Give me a break.
[02:13:38.235 --> 02:13:43.960]  We saved Russia from total defeat and collapse as a country during World War II.
[02:13:44.340 --> 02:13:46.202]  Murdering, bank robbing thug.
[02:13:46.542 --> 02:13:50.165]  In the book you're talking about, Tragedy and Hope by Carol Quigley, absolutely.
[02:13:52.833 --> 02:13:53.733]  Right off the top of my head.
[02:13:53.753 --> 02:13:55.414]  He's giggling and snickering.
[02:13:55.494 --> 02:13:57.135]  Quigley is how they run everything.
[02:13:57.875 --> 02:13:59.096]  Yeah, he thought it was a good idea.
[02:13:59.736 --> 02:14:00.716]  He thought it was a good idea.
[02:14:01.737 --> 02:14:05.839]  But Lenin said, give me your children for one generation and I'll have your country.
[02:14:06.239 --> 02:14:07.959]  Look what's happening to our kids today.
[02:14:08.980 --> 02:14:13.042]  Stalin said it matters not how the people vote, only who counts the votes.
[02:14:13.422 --> 02:14:18.324]  And that goes right along with all this electronic voting they're trying to put in.
[02:14:19.181 --> 02:14:23.023]  And the last one is by Mao, he said, political power comes out of the barrel of a gun.
[02:14:23.043 --> 02:14:25.605]  And that's why I've never given mine up.
[02:14:26.565 --> 02:14:29.487]  Well, I mean, I read the People's Daily every week.
[02:14:30.467 --> 02:14:34.630]  And I mean, it's just unbelievable that they won't even, and our corporations all love it.
[02:14:35.530 --> 02:14:36.951]  Oh, it's just, you can't even imagine.
[02:14:36.971 --> 02:14:40.133]  It is so amazing.
[02:14:41.341 --> 02:14:51.829]  One other thing I just thought of, during the Vietnam War, we actually increased trade with the Eastern Bloc Soviet countries at the same time the Vietnam War was going on.
[02:14:52.089 --> 02:14:58.774]  That's where the munitions were coming from, and going by ship into Haiphong Harbor, which we never bombed.
[02:14:58.874 --> 02:15:00.695]  Geez, isn't that interesting?
[02:15:00.815 --> 02:15:03.617]  I don't know, it's all Nazi lies, all Nazi lies.
[02:15:03.657 --> 02:15:05.699]  Here, John, would you like to talk to John from Ohio?
[02:15:05.859 --> 02:15:07.320]  I don't know if I can keep my temper.
[02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:08.080]  No, no, go ahead.
[02:15:08.100 --> 02:15:09.181]  You guys control yourselves.
[02:15:09.521 --> 02:15:16.926]  I've already been called a Nazi and a bunch of... and we should take signs away from people that criticize Fidel here in America, because that's freedom.
[02:15:17.727 --> 02:15:20.028]  So you are now known as Commissariat, John, from Ohio.
[02:15:20.289 --> 02:15:21.109]  Political officer.
[02:15:21.149 --> 02:15:21.529]  Go ahead.
[02:15:21.890 --> 02:15:29.355]  Well, you know, if you want to put words in my mouth and name quotes... No, you said you were defending people trying to stop free speech in America.
[02:15:29.395 --> 02:15:30.776]  Well, you're doing it right now.
[02:15:30.956 --> 02:15:37.380]  But all I'm saying is that if we want to get an actual opinion of somebody, we should hear from the primary source.
[02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:42.844]  Not the enemies, not the fabricators, not the forgers of Marxism or Socialism.
[02:15:42.904 --> 02:15:47.568]  I don't belong to any party, and I don't consider myself trendy.
[02:15:47.969 --> 02:15:52.232]  I'm desperately concerned with pushing many of the ideas that you're very concerned about.
[02:15:52.272 --> 02:15:57.837]  The 9-11 conspiracy, complicity by the government, the police state measures.
[02:15:58.577 --> 02:16:06.504]  You're absolutely right about the civil war that they're deliberately inciting through Asian provocateurs in Iraq.
[02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:08.081]  Divide that country.
[02:16:08.601 --> 02:16:18.750]  But when it comes to understanding what the Soviet Union or China as deformed, not real socialist states are, I don't think we should go to sources like this.
[02:16:18.790 --> 02:16:19.951]  Well, let me explain something to you.
[02:16:19.971 --> 02:16:23.594]  If we were a bunch of honeybees, socialism and communism would work.
[02:16:23.894 --> 02:16:25.716]  That's not human nature.
[02:16:25.756 --> 02:16:28.138]  Well, I'm not even talking about whether it will work or not.
[02:16:28.178 --> 02:16:32.001]  I'm just talking about getting accurate information about where they are, what they are,
[02:16:32.421 --> 02:16:33.482]  And where they came from.
[02:16:33.602 --> 02:16:37.906]  And I think WSWS.org is one, Workers.org is another.
[02:16:37.966 --> 02:16:42.549]  They don't even agree with each other, but they are at least primary Marxist sources.
[02:16:42.709 --> 02:16:46.533]  Rather than going for the liars, the enemies of socialism, the Soviet Union, the CIA,
[02:16:47.344 --> 02:16:52.969]  And the leftover Nazi fabrications and forgeries that were brought... So George Orwell lied, too?
[02:16:53.430 --> 02:16:53.690]  He lied?
[02:16:53.730 --> 02:16:57.813]  He was a British intelligence agent, so I don't agree with everything that he said, either.
[02:16:57.874 --> 02:16:59.695]  I think he was... Oh, come on!
[02:17:00.256 --> 02:17:01.997]  He was... Oh, he got shot over there!
[02:17:02.237 --> 02:17:02.838]  Can I get in?
[02:17:02.878 --> 02:17:03.499]  Can I get in?
[02:17:03.639 --> 02:17:04.199]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:17:04.459 --> 02:17:13.828]  Well, the things that he's talking about, and that you mentioned earlier, the progressive income tax, which clobbers the middle class and the poor people, that's right out of Karl Marx.
[02:17:14.403 --> 02:17:18.165]  The privately owned central bank... Yeah, stay there, stay there.
[02:17:18.265 --> 02:17:19.426]  Public education.
[02:17:19.486 --> 02:17:21.227]  Privately owned central bank.
[02:17:21.327 --> 02:17:21.988]  Income tax.
[02:17:22.228 --> 02:17:24.089]  It's the banker 1913 plan.
[02:17:24.329 --> 02:17:26.871]  And they got it in 1970, 1918 in Russia.
[02:17:27.231 --> 02:17:28.371]  It's the banker plan!
[02:17:28.612 --> 02:17:31.774]  Go read the Communist Manifesto and then look at America today.
[02:17:32.594 --> 02:17:33.214]  Coup de Grace.
[02:17:33.234 --> 02:17:34.575]  You just hit it out of the park.
[02:17:35.216 --> 02:17:37.037]  You just hit a long home run, baby.
[02:17:37.677 --> 02:17:38.658]  Absolutely.
[02:17:38.958 --> 02:17:41.499]  Just deep-sixed you again, John from Ohio.
[02:17:41.539 --> 02:17:42.340]  Stay there, both of you.
[02:17:45.603 --> 02:17:49.085]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:17:49.365 --> 02:17:52.866]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:17:52.946 --> 02:17:56.888]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:17:57.108 --> 02:18:03.271]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:18:03.691 --> 02:18:11.595]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:18:12.015 --> 02:18:17.358]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:18:17.498 --> 02:18:21.260]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:18:21.640 --> 02:18:23.481]  And the Black Berkey Filters are reclaimable.
[02:18:23.561 --> 02:18:25.723]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:18:25.963 --> 02:18:31.205]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91, or a 4-pack for only $173.
[02:18:31.245 --> 02:18:36.488]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:18:39.890 --> 02:18:42.311]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:18:42.331 --> 02:18:43.731]  Protect your family.
[02:18:50.332 --> 02:18:51.572]  Currency devaluation.
[02:18:51.872 --> 02:18:52.453]  Inflation.
[02:18:52.913 --> 02:18:53.593]  One and the same.
[02:18:54.333 --> 02:18:58.274]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%, in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:19:04.594 --> 02:19:07.715]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:19:07.975 --> 02:19:09.796]  The bank paid you 1%.
[02:19:09.856 --> 02:19:12.897]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:19:13.437 --> 02:19:15.658]  Here is reality.
[02:19:16.018 --> 02:19:19.600]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:19:20.080 --> 02:19:23.741]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:19:24.322 --> 02:19:26.883]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[02:19:28.484 --> 02:19:32.209]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.
[02:19:32.569 --> 02:19:33.751]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:33.771 --> 02:19:33.971]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:44.437 --> 02:19:46.738]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:46.858 --> 02:19:52.199]  Did you know executive orders and other laws have already been passed that can create a legal dictatorship in America?
[02:19:52.719 --> 02:20:09.663]  These laws can affect you by seizing all communication media, all electric power, fuel, minerals, food supplies, and resources, all farms and farm equipment, all means of transportation including personal vehicles, total control over all highways, seaports, and waterways.
[02:20:10.203 --> 02:20:12.704]  Seize all American people for workforces.
[02:20:13.633 --> 02:20:16.034]  These laws extend to all parts of our life.
[02:20:16.635 --> 02:20:24.238]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:24.919 --> 02:20:26.359]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:31.782 --> 02:20:35.964]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:37.404 --> 02:20:38.024]  Call now.
[02:20:38.225 --> 02:20:43.987]  Operators are standing by to receive your call for a one-year free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:44.387 --> 02:20:48.428]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:20:48.668 --> 02:20:52.050]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:20:52.230 --> 02:20:55.691]  Here's Dr. Matson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:20:55.959 --> 02:20:59.222]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:20:59.242 --> 02:21:04.707]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we've seen.
[02:21:04.747 --> 02:21:14.376]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jog a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:21:14.516 --> 02:21:15.817]  It's a well thought out formula.
[02:21:15.837 --> 02:21:21.302]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:21:21.681 --> 02:21:26.223]  If you'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:21:26.303 --> 02:21:27.663]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:21:27.823 --> 02:21:31.645]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[02:21:31.705 --> 02:21:32.585]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[02:21:48.690 --> 02:21:52.933]  I got a lot of other news I want to cover and give the other callers a chance.
[02:21:53.514 --> 02:21:57.757]  Gentlemen, let's go after John in New York real quick.
[02:21:58.838 --> 02:22:02.741]  Yeah, I mean really, if you read the Communist Manifesto, in fact I've got a copy.
[02:22:03.877 --> 02:22:04.617]  Some more in here.
[02:22:04.718 --> 02:22:13.362]  If you read the Communist Manifesto, it's exactly what the bankers are implementing, and it's exactly what helps the bankers consolidate and put us all back on the plantation.
[02:22:13.922 --> 02:22:15.803]  Go ahead and continue commenting, John, in New York.
[02:22:16.163 --> 02:22:27.169]  There's ten planks that are listed in the center of the book that I have that list the things like the Federal Reserve and the education and elimination of private property and progressive income tax.
[02:22:27.597 --> 02:22:34.425]  And if you look at what's happening today with the Republican-controlled Congress and George Bush, it's like it's their playbook.
[02:22:34.465 --> 02:22:35.306]  Yeah, let me just read it.
[02:22:35.566 --> 02:22:37.429]  Number one, abolition of private property.
[02:22:37.469 --> 02:22:39.331]  Number two, heavy progressive income tax.
[02:22:39.871 --> 02:22:40.973]  We have both of those.
[02:22:41.013 --> 02:22:45.178]  I mean, the Supreme Court says you can't have your private property, only the bankers can.
[02:22:45.678 --> 02:22:58.000]  Number two, heavy progressive income tax, abolition of all rights of inheritance, confiscation of property of all immigrants and rebels, that's anybody that doesn't worship the government, enemy combatants.
[02:22:58.440 --> 02:22:59.621]  Five, a central bank.
[02:22:59.781 --> 02:23:03.461]  Six, government control of communications and transportation.
[02:23:03.881 --> 02:23:06.022]  I'm like blaspheming the Bible right now, John.
[02:23:06.602 --> 02:23:12.123]  Seven, government ownership of factories and agriculture, now that's global corporations, their government.
[02:23:12.603 --> 02:23:13.864]  Government control of labor.
[02:23:13.924 --> 02:23:15.844]  Global corporations are getting governmental power.
[02:23:16.325 --> 02:23:17.365]  Corporate farms.
[02:23:17.545 --> 02:23:18.605]  Regional planning.
[02:23:18.765 --> 02:23:20.066]  Exactly what we're under.
[02:23:20.086 --> 02:23:20.066]  10.
[02:23:21.146 --> 02:23:22.747]  Governmental control of education.
[02:23:23.267 --> 02:23:25.248]  Exactly what the bankers lobby for.
[02:23:25.868 --> 02:23:27.209]  The corporations control it.
[02:23:27.709 --> 02:23:31.310]  And John in Ohio just can't get it when it's one inch in front of his face.
[02:23:31.650 --> 02:23:33.291]  It isn't a commie program, John.
[02:23:33.311 --> 02:23:33.651]  You're right.
[02:23:33.711 --> 02:23:34.511]  It's not communism.
[02:23:34.772 --> 02:23:35.832]  It's bankerism.
[02:23:36.192 --> 02:23:38.133]  You are a servant of the bankers.
[02:23:38.976 --> 02:23:39.336]  Hello?
[02:23:40.036 --> 02:23:49.540]  David Rockefeller was one of the major stockholders in the Federal Reserve, along with some of the other big bankers from Europe.
[02:23:49.800 --> 02:23:52.401]  Yeah, but let me get a comment from John there in Ohio.
[02:23:53.102 --> 02:24:03.466]  Yeah, what I wanted to say is that we're fighting for our lives here, and the ideology, the mother's milk, the whole pretext of the neocons, the military-industrial complex,
[02:24:03.976 --> 02:24:05.638]  ...has been based on anti-communism.
[02:24:05.658 --> 02:24:09.321]  That's on a back-burner now, because China... Wait a minute!
[02:24:09.361 --> 02:24:10.602]  Wait a minute!
[02:24:10.822 --> 02:24:26.557]  And they just so happen to all be the heads of the Communist Fourth International Trotskyites, who woke up and became conservative, just like Michael Savage was a big beatnik leader, and then he woke up to become a conservative, but
[02:24:26.997 --> 02:24:32.139]  He wants the New World Order, and he wants to put the people in the camps that don't agree with the war.
[02:24:32.740 --> 02:24:37.062]  It's all the little commies taking over, but they're not commies anymore.
[02:24:37.082 --> 02:24:37.822]  Go ahead, John.
[02:24:38.162 --> 02:24:39.863]  They never were communists.
[02:24:39.903 --> 02:24:47.106]  They were, obviously, agents, provocateurs, spies... But you don't deny they were the head of the Communist Fourth International!
[02:24:47.406 --> 02:24:50.868]  They are absolutely the opposite of anything the Fourth International.
[02:24:51.068 --> 02:24:53.329]  Prostitutes, Marxists... It's their sons!
[02:24:53.409 --> 02:24:54.330]  It's all their little boys!
[02:24:55.510 --> 02:25:02.053]  They were, they came out of, actually they came out of the military-industrial complex, vicious anti-communism.
[02:25:02.333 --> 02:25:09.916]  They were the ones that were peddling all of the Iran conference stuff during the Reagan war on people in Nicaragua and Central America.
[02:25:09.936 --> 02:25:16.239]  Sir, sir, sir, liberal publications admit that the entire neocon gaggle are a bunch of Trotskyites.
[02:25:18.014 --> 02:25:18.755]  They were agents!
[02:25:18.955 --> 02:25:19.615]  They were agents!
[02:25:19.655 --> 02:25:20.795]  They were police agents!
[02:25:20.855 --> 02:25:22.696]  They were not Trotskyists then or ever!
[02:25:22.716 --> 02:25:23.476]  Okay.
[02:25:23.616 --> 02:25:36.920]  And furthermore, furthermore, you know, you never mention the fact that the fourteen capitalist countries immediately, including the United States and England, invaded the Soviet Union at various points around their country to support the whites.
[02:25:37.360 --> 02:25:45.002]  You know, this crazy John Birch Society, David K. Smith thing that puts a populist cover on the global military-industrial
[02:25:45.373 --> 02:25:50.836]  The claim that the bankers supported Russia is exactly what you're accusing the others of saying.
[02:25:51.236 --> 02:25:53.717]  It's putting the false populism cover on that.
[02:25:53.997 --> 02:25:54.678]  Thank you, John.
[02:25:54.778 --> 02:25:55.358]  Thank you, John.
[02:25:55.398 --> 02:25:57.019]  Yeah, sure.
[02:25:57.539 --> 02:26:09.825]  I read the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation minutes, Carnegie Endowment minutes, and Carol Quigley's book about it, who's one of their chief strategists, and the Trilateral Commission, and Brzezinski, and David Rockefeller, and the New York Times saying it.
[02:26:10.526 --> 02:26:13.187]  And the head of the CIA for the section chief saying it.
[02:26:14.031 --> 02:26:15.772]  John New York, in closing, I've got to break.
[02:26:15.792 --> 02:26:18.815]  I've got other calls, but you're not going to wake him up, are you?
[02:26:18.835 --> 02:26:19.836]  Thank you very much.
[02:26:20.736 --> 02:26:22.217]  There's no waking him up, is there, John?
[02:26:22.417 --> 02:26:23.418]  I don't think so.
[02:26:23.478 --> 02:26:26.701]  God, all these historical facts, you can't deny them.
[02:26:26.781 --> 02:26:29.743]  I mean, we were not allowed to win the Vietnam War.
[02:26:29.783 --> 02:26:31.784]  We were not allowed to win the Korean War.
[02:26:31.845 --> 02:26:35.427]  Now we're in another mess, and they want to take us into another mess.
[02:26:35.807 --> 02:26:36.568]  It's our ending.
[02:26:36.848 --> 02:26:37.289]  I hear you.
[02:26:37.329 --> 02:26:38.109]  Thanks for the call.
[02:26:38.309 --> 02:26:41.692]  I mean, right here, a summary of the Communist Manifesto.
[02:26:42.896 --> 02:26:47.617]  Okay, now this is the ten planks from the official Communist Manifesto.
[02:26:49.717 --> 02:26:52.118]  Now, I'm sure John will say this is Nazi propaganda.
[02:26:52.838 --> 02:26:55.738]  This is what Karl Marx and Engels wrote.
[02:26:56.498 --> 02:27:01.419]  Abolition of private property, and I would just add, in the hands of the general public, only in the hands of the elite.
[02:27:01.939 --> 02:27:04.020]  Number two, heavy progressive income tax.
[02:27:04.220 --> 02:27:09.981]  Now, the bankers got it passed here in 1913, started the revolution at the same time over in Russia.
[02:27:11.041 --> 02:27:12.201]  I mean, what are you talking about?
[02:27:15.117 --> 02:27:17.278]  Corporate farms, regional planning, what do we have now?
[02:27:17.339 --> 02:27:18.759]  Government control of education.
[02:27:20.541 --> 02:27:22.642]  Government control of labor, labor department, all of that.
[02:27:22.702 --> 02:27:24.283]  Government ownership of factories, agriculture.
[02:27:24.303 --> 02:27:26.705]  I mean, it's all right here.
[02:27:28.646 --> 02:27:30.047]  I mean, it's a nightmare!
[02:27:30.767 --> 02:27:32.849]  That's not freedom, that's what your commies say!
[02:27:33.249 --> 02:27:34.189]  Your commie!
[02:27:35.911 --> 02:27:36.831]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.291 --> 02:27:38.912]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.813 --> 02:27:42.515]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.972 --> 02:27:49.534]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:27:49.694 --> 02:27:51.855]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:27:52.135 --> 02:28:02.221]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[02:28:02.542 --> 02:28:04.863]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.

[02:28:35.394 --> 02:28:36.795]  That's 1-800-340-7091 or on the web at CalbinPureSoap.com.
[02:28:46.002 --> 02:28:51.227]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:28:51.367 --> 02:28:59.456]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:28:59.716 --> 02:29:06.763]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:29:07.704 --> 02:29:14.188]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:29:14.388 --> 02:29:19.472]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:29:19.592 --> 02:29:28.478]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:29:28.738 --> 02:29:32.021]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[02:29:34.202 --> 02:29:34.582]  I think?
[02:29:45.526 --> 02:29:46.607]  You don't love me anymore?
[02:29:46.967 --> 02:29:48.749]  You used to take such good care of me.
[02:29:48.769 --> 02:29:50.250]  Is that my car talking to me?
[02:29:50.390 --> 02:29:50.670]  Yes.
[02:29:50.990 --> 02:29:51.831]  You neglect me.
[02:29:51.991 --> 02:29:53.973]  Change my oil late most of the time.
[02:29:55.814 --> 02:29:56.815]  Use the cheapest gas.
[02:29:57.175 --> 02:29:58.016]  I'm getting sick.
[02:29:58.356 --> 02:30:00.538]  One of these days, I'm just gonna give up.
[02:30:01.578 --> 02:30:02.079]  Wait a minute.
[02:30:02.159 --> 02:30:03.800]  I've got three more years of payments on you.
[02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:12.547]  If you want me to last forever, you need to add protected engine treatment, protected transmission treatment, and especially protected complete fuel system treatment.
[02:30:13.007 --> 02:30:18.491]  Protecta's unique synthetic fortifiers treat the metal and the oil to reduce friction like no other.
[02:30:18.711 --> 02:30:21.173]  Okay, I'll add some Protecta, but you'll have to perform.
[02:30:21.253 --> 02:30:25.937]  How about faster acceleration, more horsepower, longer lasting.
[02:30:26.137 --> 02:30:27.698]  I'll always be there for you.
[02:30:27.998 --> 02:30:31.320]  So if you want more, treat it right with Protecta by SFR.
[02:30:31.500 --> 02:30:39.204]  For a special offer of free shipping, go to www.sfrcorp.com or call 888-USE-SFR1.
[02:30:39.384 --> 02:30:44.846]  That's www.sfrcorp.com or call 888-USE-SFR1.
[02:30:45.927 --> 02:30:51.550]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:51.890 --> 02:30:57.473]  Alright, we got diverted off by the apologists for the communists for the last 30 minutes.
[02:30:58.331 --> 02:31:07.773]  But it's an important discussion to have, because Jones is stubborn as a fence post, and you're not going to change him.
[02:31:08.533 --> 02:31:09.433]  Not in a hundred years.
[02:31:09.533 --> 02:31:13.854]  You'll disregard any evidence that doesn't point towards the false paradigm that he believes in.
[02:31:16.435 --> 02:31:19.315]  But really, I indict communism on what it calls for.
[02:31:19.395 --> 02:31:20.196]  A central bank.
[02:31:20.256 --> 02:31:21.416]  That's what the globalists want.
[02:31:21.476 --> 02:31:23.076]  The big international bankers that funded it.
[02:31:23.396 --> 02:31:24.916]  They didn't want another corrupt elite.
[02:31:24.996 --> 02:31:26.157]  I'm not defending the czarists.
[02:31:26.797 --> 02:31:27.317]  White Russia.
[02:31:28.632 --> 02:31:29.852]  Nothing to do with white people, folks.
[02:31:29.872 --> 02:31:30.812]  That's what they were called.
[02:31:31.893 --> 02:31:33.953]  And I'm not defending them, either.
[02:31:35.573 --> 02:31:40.534]  But this system, this system is very, very corrupt.
[02:31:40.594 --> 02:31:54.896]  I mean, an income tax, abolition of private property, central banks, government control of communications and transportation, public education, all of this stuff.
[02:31:56.157 --> 02:31:57.777]  It's what America now is.
[02:31:59.674 --> 02:32:09.100]  And who gets to finance it, and who gets to fund it, and who gets to get the profits from it, and who gets control out of zeros and ones the bankers just put on a ledger sheet or in modern times on a computer?
[02:32:10.140 --> 02:32:12.602]  This small, global crime syndicate.
[02:32:12.822 --> 02:32:13.642]  The crime families.
[02:32:13.682 --> 02:32:15.823]  The international crime bosses.
[02:32:17.825 --> 02:32:18.785]  James in Maryland.
[02:32:18.805 --> 02:32:19.426]  You're on the air.
[02:32:19.446 --> 02:32:20.066]  Thanks for holding.
[02:32:20.106 --> 02:32:20.526]  Go ahead.
[02:32:20.546 --> 02:32:22.267]  I have two questions.
[02:32:23.688 --> 02:32:26.850]  One, with the recent developments with
[02:32:27.642 --> 02:32:33.547]  Milosevic, why do you think Moussaoui and Hussein were allowed to live and testify?
[02:32:33.607 --> 02:32:42.454]  And two, who do you think is going to win the Israeli elections and the possible ramifications of that?
[02:32:42.494 --> 02:32:43.415]  And I'll listen off air.
[02:32:43.935 --> 02:32:45.196]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[02:32:46.337 --> 02:32:48.839]  I never pretend to know who's going to win in the Knesset.
[02:32:49.880 --> 02:32:55.124]  In that parliamentary Byzantine haggling that goes on over there.
[02:32:55.882 --> 02:33:07.509]  But I mean, it's going to be the Likudniks, or it's going to be the coalition run by the Current Crop, whose figurehead is the brain-dead Sharon, if he's even alive, wouldn't even know that.
[02:33:08.250 --> 02:33:10.791]  They announced he was dead for two days and said, oh no, he's not really dead.
[02:33:12.112 --> 02:33:14.754]  It's kind of like Milosevic, we know they killed him.
[02:33:16.866 --> 02:33:19.226]  First, it's, you know, he was poisoned, he wasn't poisoned.
[02:33:19.246 --> 02:33:20.207]  Well, yes, he was poisoned.
[02:33:20.227 --> 02:33:21.227]  Well, he had the drug in him.
[02:33:21.667 --> 02:33:23.687]  Well, he didn't have enough of the drug in him for it to kill him.
[02:33:24.147 --> 02:33:27.888]  Oh, well, he took the drug himself to make it look like he was going to have a heart attack.
[02:33:28.408 --> 02:33:31.048]  And then he had lights on 24 hours a day and guards in there.
[02:33:31.068 --> 02:33:32.749]  I mean, total control.
[02:33:32.769 --> 02:33:36.629]  He wasn't... No one was smuggling Slobo anything.
[02:33:37.650 --> 02:33:39.750]  And, of course, they were killing other witnesses in there as well.
[02:33:39.790 --> 02:33:41.170]  But, no, all that's circumstantial.
[02:33:43.431 --> 02:33:45.451]  Now, he was in there four and a half years.
[02:33:46.690 --> 02:33:47.551]  Almost five.
[02:33:48.872 --> 02:33:54.438]  So, they haven't killed Saddam yet, supposedly, and they haven't killed Moussaoui yet.
[02:33:54.478 --> 02:34:04.167]  I mean, the judge in the Moussaoui case says, you guys have fabricated, put on fake witnesses, coached them, lied.
[02:34:06.270 --> 02:34:09.713]  I'm going to let you have your conviction, but I'm not going to let you execute him.
[02:34:14.133 --> 02:34:15.614]  And that's probably all stage two.
[02:34:15.634 --> 02:34:31.220]  I mean, at the level where they hoax and sign bills that didn't pass, and at the level where Bush says he's above the law, I mean, this is a crowd that plants stories of WMDs in the memos where they admit they're lying, come out, and they don't get in trouble.
[02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:34.961]  So it's a recipe for disaster.
[02:34:34.981 --> 02:34:37.362]  I mean, we don't even know if that's the real Saddam Hussein.
[02:34:38.732 --> 02:34:44.114]  We know that whoever that Saddam is, and we know he had about eight different look-alikes that were in custody.
[02:34:47.616 --> 02:34:49.357]  What is it, the genome and the phenome?
[02:34:49.657 --> 02:34:53.638]  There were a lot of people that looked like Saddam Hussein in that area of the country.
[02:34:54.419 --> 02:34:55.379]  Some certain bloodlines.
[02:34:55.399 --> 02:34:56.480]  So yeah, a lot of doubles.
[02:34:57.900 --> 02:35:00.301]  By the way, you tell people they're doubles, they roll their eyes.
[02:35:00.321 --> 02:35:01.882]  Did you know Bush has doubles?
[02:35:02.546 --> 02:35:04.627]  You know, Clinton had doubles, Roosevelt had doubles.
[02:35:04.667 --> 02:35:06.148]  They're real quiet about it here in the media.
[02:35:06.168 --> 02:35:07.128]  You don't talk about it.
[02:35:07.629 --> 02:35:08.789]  But it's in some history books.
[02:35:08.809 --> 02:35:14.032]  Of course, mainly doubles with them will ride, looking like Bush, in the limo.
[02:35:15.732 --> 02:35:19.895]  And then Bush is really in a helicopter that's about to land ten minutes later, or in a truck behind him.
[02:35:20.395 --> 02:35:21.795]  They think, you know, quote, he's in danger.
[02:35:24.017 --> 02:35:26.518]  But then you tell people that could be a double, and they don't even believe that.
[02:35:26.598 --> 02:35:28.719]  I mean, there's no such thing as doubles.
[02:35:30.023 --> 02:35:33.265]  But we know that whoever that devil is, or if it is Saddam, might be.
[02:35:34.746 --> 02:35:39.009]  All we know is, because we've been lied to so much, we can't believe liars.
[02:35:40.698 --> 02:35:45.280]  All we know is that whoever that is was in the custody for weeks of the Kurds.
[02:35:45.940 --> 02:35:47.921]  And they staged finding him in the spider hole.
[02:35:47.981 --> 02:35:54.703]  In truth, they beat him up, had him for weeks, and went out there and they even caught the Marine Corps General on tape going, alright, here's the story.
[02:35:54.743 --> 02:35:55.543]  We found that hole.
[02:35:55.563 --> 02:35:56.263]  Do you understand?
[02:35:56.604 --> 02:35:57.644]  Don't say anything else.
[02:35:57.764 --> 02:35:58.984]  Alright, that's the official story.
[02:35:59.325 --> 02:36:00.605]  And we learn it isn't a true story.
[02:36:00.625 --> 02:36:02.085]  And then it's kind of like, oh, well, okay.
[02:36:02.386 --> 02:36:03.466]  They staged that too.
[02:36:04.366 --> 02:36:05.787]  The Fat Bin Laden tape.
[02:36:05.847 --> 02:36:07.847]  Admittedly, the voice print, all of it in him.
[02:36:08.288 --> 02:36:09.248]  Okay, that's staged.
[02:36:10.556 --> 02:36:12.818]  Oh, the last five times they brought out Bin Laden tapes.
[02:36:12.858 --> 02:36:15.460]  Turns out they're edits of old tapes from four years ago.
[02:36:15.500 --> 02:36:16.961]  Well, just ignore that.
[02:36:17.041 --> 02:36:17.521]  Move on.
[02:36:17.581 --> 02:36:18.462]  It's still Bin Laden.
[02:36:24.367 --> 02:36:33.213]  We have a government that spends billions of dollars putting on fake newscasts and paying for fake news and paying reporters to lie.
[02:36:33.333 --> 02:36:33.974]  That's admitted!
[02:36:36.135 --> 02:36:36.496]  Admitted!
[02:36:37.837 --> 02:36:38.137]  Public!
[02:36:39.833 --> 02:36:41.554]  And that's just the surface stuff.
[02:36:45.275 --> 02:37:08.643]  They told us on our news that, oh, Iraq is so free, they've got all these free newspapers, there's now freedom, Ronald Spalding Bush gave speeches, and it turns out that every newspaper's fake, run by the Central Intelligence Agency or the Defense Department, and most of it's written in New York, or in Chicago, by Arabic government agents, or Arabic writers, people that know it well in Farsi and all the rest of it,
[02:37:09.463 --> 02:37:16.366]  And then if you write anything even vaguely critical, a death squad comes by and blows your head off, and if you're lucky, you get 30 years in prison.
[02:37:16.927 --> 02:37:18.547]  There is no freedom!
[02:37:18.887 --> 02:37:25.130]  And then, they love to do the same thing here, these crooks, and they get up on TV and they lie to us, and say, well they got freedom of the press.
[02:37:25.370 --> 02:37:28.592]  And when it comes out, neocon followers go, well that's good, that's freedom!
[02:37:37.193 --> 02:37:42.196]  And you see insurgents is really tough when they step out of the truss bus pull through it.
[02:37:43.096 --> 02:37:49.140]  No, the official Pentagon plan is to fail, to stay there longer.
[02:37:55.023 --> 02:37:57.244]  So, hope that answers your question.
[02:37:57.584 --> 02:37:59.305]  Nehru in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:37:59.325 --> 02:38:00.246]  Hey Alex.
[02:38:00.626 --> 02:38:00.966]  Hi.
[02:38:01.306 --> 02:38:05.969]  I just want to say that you're my hero and I listen to your show every day when I ride the bus to college.
[02:38:06.949 --> 02:38:08.029]  I got a question for you though.
[02:38:09.690 --> 02:38:12.550]  Is there any way I can get a signed picture of you?
[02:38:12.570 --> 02:38:14.151]  So I can post on my wall?
[02:38:14.491 --> 02:38:20.832]  You know, we don't really have any of the classical glamour shots or publicity shots that most talk show hosts have.
[02:38:23.393 --> 02:38:26.574]  There are a whole bunch of free photos of me all over the web.
[02:38:27.194 --> 02:38:31.195]  So print out the one you like and hang it on the wall.
[02:38:32.735 --> 02:38:34.516]  And if you want something signed from me.
[02:38:35.416 --> 02:38:36.496]  That's what I would really like.
[02:38:38.123 --> 02:38:43.004]  Well, the problem is, you know, I sell my signature, and not because I even want the money.
[02:38:43.024 --> 02:38:46.585]  It's just that if I offer it for free, I'm not trying to brag.
[02:38:46.625 --> 02:38:48.286]  I'll be signing thousands a week.
[02:38:48.966 --> 02:38:51.007]  And it would really be impossible to get any work done.
[02:38:51.027 --> 02:38:51.887]  It's already annoying.
[02:38:52.027 --> 02:38:54.008]  And I like doing it, but I run out of time.
[02:38:54.028 --> 02:38:57.589]  I've got all this serious stuff to do, and I'm sitting there signing my book, Dissent and Tyranny.
[02:38:58.269 --> 02:39:01.870]  If you get a Dissent and Tyranny, sir, I'll sign it for you.
[02:39:01.950 --> 02:39:05.791]  And I'd like to tell you, you know, if you mailed me a
[02:39:07.384 --> 02:39:09.825]  Citizen Rulebook and ask me to sign it, I might do it.
[02:39:09.845 --> 02:39:13.728]  But then I'm going to get a bunch of requests for people that order Citizen Rulebooks that I sign those.
[02:39:14.388 --> 02:39:19.311]  And I just really, it's not a good, it's not the best way to spend my time.
[02:39:20.632 --> 02:39:24.314]  I mean, I'm really having to push myself to work as much as I am, and I'm not tootin' my horn saying that.
[02:39:24.374 --> 02:39:25.875]  I just want, you know, people to know.
[02:39:25.915 --> 02:39:31.137]  I feel so bad that I can't respond to emails, can't respond to letters, can't respond to faxes, can't respond.
[02:39:31.177 --> 02:39:32.218]  I mean, I do respond.
[02:39:32.238 --> 02:39:41.042]  We spend a lot of time now at the office with the woman having her kids taken and her people having their ranches taken, just trying to give them groups we know will try to help them at least, and then those groups are over.
[02:39:41.082 --> 02:39:42.302]  They're like, help me, please!
[02:39:42.322 --> 02:39:44.804]  Believe me, I want to talk about medicine, here's the evidence.
[02:39:44.824 --> 02:39:46.024]  I'm like, I know, I know.
[02:39:46.044 --> 02:39:47.445]  I can't help you.
[02:39:48.661 --> 02:39:51.883]  I can try to give you a few organizations, please!
[02:39:52.403 --> 02:39:53.524]  And I mean, I start crying.
[02:39:53.584 --> 02:39:55.505]  I'm sitting here, I'll start yelling after they're on the phone.
[02:39:55.525 --> 02:39:56.386]  I'm like, I'm sick of it!
[02:39:59.728 --> 02:40:03.350]  It's like having a lifeboat, and there's only so many people that can fit in a lifeboat.
[02:40:05.512 --> 02:40:07.473]  And I'm trying to get you in a lifeboat.
[02:40:09.294 --> 02:40:10.495]  And I'm really depressed right now.
[02:40:14.677 --> 02:40:15.758]  Thanks for the call, Drew.
[02:40:17.223 --> 02:40:25.205]  I didn't start the show to press, I rarely get down, but I am just... Talking to John got me down.
[02:40:28.006 --> 02:40:30.467]  Talking to that poor person.
[02:40:31.727 --> 02:40:36.508]  There's so many little neocons like him who think that they're doing good by George Bush.
[02:40:38.049 --> 02:40:42.110]  They're caught in a paradigm, caught in the matrix, caught in the spider's web.
[02:40:42.130 --> 02:40:45.511]  And I've done the hard research.
[02:40:47.894 --> 02:40:49.335]  And he's so in denial.
[02:40:49.375 --> 02:40:51.755]  He doesn't know that the globalists set up the UN.
[02:40:51.775 --> 02:40:53.076]  He doesn't understand globalism.
[02:40:55.036 --> 02:41:01.679]  That the UN has said, that the CFR has said, on television, on C-SPAN, that they're the model.
[02:41:04.359 --> 02:41:05.920]  And then look at the real transfer there.
[02:41:07.580 --> 02:41:11.562]  Of our brain trust, of our industry, of everything.
[02:41:11.602 --> 02:41:12.662]  I mean, I can see their plan.
[02:41:12.702 --> 02:41:15.243]  I can read top globalist strategists.
[02:41:18.952 --> 02:41:23.476]  Where they explain all of this, and how they've done it, and what they did, and it's the truth!
[02:41:24.657 --> 02:41:30.222]  And you're not going to wake up a neocon, you're not going to wake up a liberal, you're not going to wake up people like John.
[02:41:30.242 --> 02:41:32.103]  They don't want to get it.
[02:41:33.044 --> 02:41:34.345]  I run into liberals all the time.
[02:41:35.066 --> 02:41:39.049]  They're not even liberals, they're little corporate phonies, who don't even know their whole ideology is false.
[02:41:39.089 --> 02:41:41.591]  They're emotionally connected to it.
[02:41:42.212 --> 02:41:45.855]  And they're like, yes, we have a tyrannical government, it's terrible, but we need to turn our guns in.
[02:41:47.489 --> 02:41:50.251]  As if turning your guns into a tyranny is a good thing.
[02:41:51.191 --> 02:41:57.115]  Because they didn't grow up around guns, they don't know guns, they don't understand guns, they don't know the statistics of guns, they just are afraid.
[02:42:01.398 --> 02:42:03.259]  You try to explain to a leftist that
[02:42:04.315 --> 02:42:07.978]  Big government and big taxes are for the big corporations.
[02:42:08.018 --> 02:42:08.919]  They don't understand it.
[02:42:09.459 --> 02:42:13.503]  You try to tell that to a phony conservative, which is most of them, they don't understand it.
[02:42:13.523 --> 02:42:20.269]  You're like, I just like George W. But George W. is massive corporate welfare, just totally selling us out.
[02:42:20.769 --> 02:42:22.911]  Crony capitalism, really bad.
[02:42:23.451 --> 02:42:31.478]  Fascism by every stretch of the imagination, using socialist governmental systems to take our wealth and to control populations and control our development.
[02:42:32.463 --> 02:42:34.925]  And to knock out any competing classes.
[02:42:35.506 --> 02:42:37.988]  You might as well be speaking Martian to these people.
[02:42:39.370 --> 02:42:41.091]  I mean, the globalists laugh at us.
[02:42:41.251 --> 02:42:42.633]  Brzezinski calls us slaves.
[02:42:43.954 --> 02:42:51.621]  And Zbigniew rightfully calls us that because they write books saying what they're going to do.
[02:42:51.681 --> 02:42:53.803]  And five, ten years later, exactly that happens.
[02:42:53.983 --> 02:42:54.644]  Just exactly.
[02:42:57.481 --> 02:43:15.025]  Pearl Harbor event that they stage, then they invade Afghanistan, then they invade Iraq, then they go into Iran, they have a domestic police state, but we're unified around the police state, and the economic constriction because of the, quote, precede war, with the foreign barbarians, the serfs will serve us, and I mean, I watch them say what they're gonna do!
[02:43:16.985 --> 02:43:21.406]  You know, John from Ohio knows I'm telling the truth about Mozadek, that's admitted, declassified.
[02:43:22.366 --> 02:43:25.067]  He knows I'm telling the truth about 9-11 and Northwood and everything else.
[02:43:26.701 --> 02:43:31.882]  And then when I know what Mao said, I know what the Communist leadership said, I know what George Bush, Jr.
[02:43:32.402 --> 02:43:38.983]  and Rockefeller, David Rockefeller, set up in 1972 over there, and I know what they did, and it's a public!
[02:43:39.623 --> 02:43:40.904]  It isn't my opinion!
[02:43:40.924 --> 02:43:48.145]  And we're in for a lot of hurt.
[02:43:50.225 --> 02:43:52.926]  We're in for the world to hurt, because a lot of you won't grow up.
[02:43:56.309 --> 02:43:59.411]  I'm talking about Bush followers, communist followers, all of you.
[02:43:59.471 --> 02:44:00.532]  You will not grow up.
[02:44:03.274 --> 02:44:06.736]  You defend your brand of fake politics like you defend your football team.
[02:44:08.177 --> 02:44:11.779]  Like you defend your favorite soft drink or your favorite brand of tennis shoe.
[02:44:11.799 --> 02:44:13.361]  Man, this isn't some branding issue.
[02:44:13.661 --> 02:44:15.382]  This is about you better get the facts.
[02:44:17.263 --> 02:44:19.064]  You better get the facts right now.
[02:44:21.106 --> 02:44:22.607]  Who does big government benefit?
[02:44:22.767 --> 02:44:23.607]  Public fact!
[02:44:23.988 --> 02:44:25.949]  Big corporations, internationalists,
[02:44:26.713 --> 02:44:29.615]  Who pushed for central banks and public education?
[02:44:30.256 --> 02:44:32.297]  The big central banks, the bankers.
[02:44:32.517 --> 02:44:33.758]  Who pushed for it in Russia?
[02:44:34.258 --> 02:44:34.919]  In China?
[02:44:35.819 --> 02:44:36.300]  Everywhere.
[02:44:36.540 --> 02:44:37.220]  The globalists.
[02:44:41.443 --> 02:44:42.444]  Who's in control?
[02:44:42.624 --> 02:44:43.365]  The globalists.
[02:44:46.227 --> 02:44:47.968]  Who's dumbing our populations down?
[02:44:48.008 --> 02:44:48.648]  The globalists.
[02:44:48.949 --> 02:44:51.610]  Who's authorizing the use of DU, which we're all breathing?
[02:44:51.650 --> 02:44:52.251]  The globalists.
[02:44:52.791 --> 02:44:54.472]  Who's putting mercury in our vaccines?
[02:44:54.512 --> 02:44:55.173]  The globalists.
[02:44:56.909 --> 02:45:00.110]  Well, we're busy running around with terms like fascist and communist and all this.
[02:45:00.170 --> 02:45:02.451]  It's command and control versus freedom.
[02:45:05.092 --> 02:45:07.934]  Hey, not having private property isn't freedom.
[02:45:12.095 --> 02:45:13.296]  And Prince Charles supports it.
[02:45:14.356 --> 02:45:16.677]  He's going to keep all his private property.
[02:45:17.017 --> 02:45:19.498]  You're not going to have yours because that gives you independence.
[02:45:19.758 --> 02:45:21.819]  That's what the science of serfdom is.
[02:45:22.359 --> 02:45:23.580]  It's called feudalism.
[02:45:25.180 --> 02:45:26.241]  All the old terms.
[02:45:28.746 --> 02:45:29.506]  Are the real terms.
[02:45:31.368 --> 02:45:33.549]  Back from a more primitive time, where it was simple.
[02:45:35.970 --> 02:45:39.432]  Now, we have been brainwashed, and people can't even communicate with each other.
[02:45:39.452 --> 02:45:42.674]  That's what 1984 is about, with the 11th edition of Ingsoc.
[02:45:42.874 --> 02:45:48.877]  He describes destroying the language, where even if someone tries to go warn the proletariat, you can't even do it.
[02:45:50.558 --> 02:45:55.161]  Because even the so-called intellectuals have these ruts in their brains,
[02:45:56.303 --> 02:45:58.244]  To where they just like wagon wheels and ruts.
[02:45:58.264 --> 02:46:00.106]  They just follow the same track like a train track.
[02:46:00.146 --> 02:46:02.167]  You just can't get them off the treadmill.
[02:46:02.528 --> 02:46:03.989]  You can't get them to wake up.
[02:46:05.710 --> 02:46:10.153]  I mean, I don't say that our leaders are devil worshippers because I think it's fanciful and it'll sell videos.
[02:46:11.074 --> 02:46:20.901]  I say it because my research and my personal investigation, my personal sneaking around in the foggy woods, I proved it.
[02:46:24.079 --> 02:46:38.935]  I don't say that the international bankers are behind communism and fascism because I think that's what's going on and I think that's an interesting ideology to believe or because somebody told me that because I have read it by the crooks that are doing it themselves.
[02:46:50.885 --> 02:46:52.385]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Florida.
[02:46:52.405 --> 02:46:53.145]  That's the last caller.
[02:46:53.185 --> 02:46:53.866]  I'm sorry, the others.
[02:46:53.926 --> 02:46:55.626]  I've got some news I want to cover on the last segment.
[02:46:55.666 --> 02:46:56.946]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Chris.
[02:46:57.906 --> 02:47:04.548]  Hey Alex, I'm Gonzales, who's a little parent there at the college about a month, a month and a half ago, where... Well, they turned it back on, yeah.
[02:47:05.008 --> 02:47:10.349]  Yeah, yeah, they called up the banners saying those who would give up essential liberty for temporary safety.
[02:47:10.409 --> 02:47:11.389]  That guy's a pig.
[02:47:11.409 --> 02:47:15.650]  Absolutely, smirking, but all the time, perpetual smirk.
[02:47:15.690 --> 02:47:19.631]  But good thing was that there he had also repeated what he had said in his
[02:47:20.365 --> 02:47:20.726]  I'm sorry.
[02:47:41.041 --> 02:47:42.962]  You might like another one, it's called Underground Army.
[02:47:43.022 --> 02:47:45.223]  She seems to know a little bit what's going on from the lyrics.
[02:47:45.903 --> 02:47:48.845]  And my question was about Title 42 of the U.S.
[02:47:48.885 --> 02:47:49.105]  Code.
[02:47:49.125 --> 02:47:58.170]  If you know anybody who might be able to apply that, or have knowledge on using that, or attorneys that are good at, you know, under the color of law, violation of civil rights.
[02:47:59.290 --> 02:48:03.352]  Yeah, $240,000 for every hour you're falsely imprisoned or incarcerated.
[02:48:03.372 --> 02:48:08.615]  I was curious, do you know anybody who would be able to help someone out with that kind of situation?
[02:48:08.635 --> 02:48:09.115]  Because I know
[02:48:09.935 --> 02:48:15.260]  You know, people magically think you just write Title 42 on something and reserve your rights, and it works sometimes.
[02:48:15.681 --> 02:48:17.062]  They don't even follow their own laws.
[02:48:17.142 --> 02:48:19.164]  Bush signs bills that weren't passed.
[02:48:19.184 --> 02:48:23.429]  I mean, does that give you an idea of how crazy it is, sir?
[02:48:23.449 --> 02:48:25.230]  I understand that.
[02:48:25.250 --> 02:48:31.657]  I mean, they run white slavery rings off Capitol Hill when it's in the Chicago Tribune, and they're in sirens going to arrest them, brother.
[02:48:32.225 --> 02:48:35.749]  Well, what did Cindy Sheehan do to sue for being arrested?
[02:48:35.909 --> 02:48:37.210]  Who did she go to?
[02:48:37.471 --> 02:48:39.233]  Well, she sued for the false arrest.
[02:48:39.273 --> 02:48:40.013]  You can sue under that.
[02:48:40.053 --> 02:48:41.655]  No, I'm not saying it isn't effective.
[02:48:41.675 --> 02:48:43.637]  I'm just saying it isn't always effective.
[02:48:46.764 --> 02:48:49.627]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:49.867 --> 02:48:51.449]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:51.789 --> 02:48:56.473]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:56.814 --> 02:49:03.560]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:49:03.880 --> 02:49:05.842]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:06.062 --> 02:49:08.904]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.004 --> 02:49:13.668]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:13.868 --> 02:49:18.271]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:18.512 --> 02:49:25.737]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[02:49:46.191 --> 02:49:49.773]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[02:49:49.813 --> 02:49:50.313]  are located?
[02:49:50.514 --> 02:49:53.895]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[02:49:54.136 --> 02:49:58.838]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
