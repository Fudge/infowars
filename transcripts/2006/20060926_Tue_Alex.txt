[00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:06.269]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:07.989]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:09.810]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.270]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:12.930]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:17.251]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.771 --> 00:00:21.872]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.718 --> 00:00:39.460]  Yesterday, we interviewed Lero Jones Chavez, or LJ.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.881]  He sent us his military discharge 214 form.
[00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:55.545]  He proved that he did indeed work at CENTCOM on 9-11, and he has reported to us that he saw top brass talking about how they had been ordered to stand down.
[00:00:55.725 --> 00:01:00.726]  They talked to NORAD and were asking why they hadn't intercepted any of the flights, and they were told to stand down.
[00:01:04.167 --> 00:01:11.608]  He wrote a letter to the editor two months ago to the Cincinnati Post because he saw a hit piece in the paper against 9-11 Truth Movement.
[00:01:12.428 --> 00:01:14.629]  And in it he said who he was and where he worked.
[00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:20.270]  And that got published and got put out all over the Internet.
[00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:33.012]  And what did the neocons do yesterday when he came on my broadcast and where he made no secret of where he worked in computer engineering, where he worked in computer business,
[00:01:34.938 --> 00:01:37.680]  We're good to go.
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.521]  We're good to go.
[00:02:01.886 --> 00:02:03.527]  I've got his emails here in front of me.
[00:02:03.547 --> 00:02:07.049]  I just came into the office about 10 minutes before airtime.
[00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:10.332]  I got ready at my house and I saw his emails here.
[00:02:10.392 --> 00:02:18.857]  We're going to see if LJ wants to come on via cell phone during his lunch hour for 10-15 minutes.
[00:02:18.877 --> 00:02:21.959]  I don't want to keep him too long and talk about what he's going through.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:30.565]  I mean, if his story is true and it's checked out so far, this is really, really big.
[00:02:31.272 --> 00:02:33.033]  And extremely important.
[00:02:34.034 --> 00:02:36.295]  And we have confirmed he was in the military.
[00:02:37.596 --> 00:02:39.717]  We have confirmed he was in Central Command.
[00:02:39.737 --> 00:02:44.920]  And we've independently verified this, not just with his honorable discharge form.
[00:02:47.612 --> 00:02:52.117]  And a lot of people are still, even in the movement, are still in denial about this.
[00:02:52.157 --> 00:02:56.601]  They just can't believe that a witness like this has just fallen in our lap.
[00:02:56.621 --> 00:02:59.845]  Well, there have been a lot of other witnesses that have fallen into our lap.
[00:02:59.905 --> 00:03:10.596]  I mean, Norman Mineta, Transportation Secretary, was on the other end of this in the White House bunker before they moved to Site R later in the day with Dick Cheney.
[00:03:11.326 --> 00:03:12.726]  The plane is 50 miles out.
[00:03:12.767 --> 00:03:13.887]  The plane is 30 miles out.
[00:03:13.947 --> 00:03:14.667]  It's 20 miles out.
[00:03:14.707 --> 00:03:15.407]  It's 10 miles out.
[00:03:15.607 --> 00:03:17.588]  Does the order still stand, Vice President?
[00:03:18.388 --> 00:03:19.669]  Yes, the order still stands.
[00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:21.249]  Have you heard anything to the contrary?
[00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:36.554]  And we know that Dick Cheney, two months before 9-11, had taken control of the shoot-down powers that had been in the generals' and their designate colonels' hands ever since NORAD was set up in 1957 for the first time
[00:03:40.257 --> 00:03:53.887]  In 40-plus years, for the first time, those powers were taken away, and we know there was a stand-down, and L.J.
[00:03:54.868 --> 00:04:05.736]  Lero Chavez was there, and he says he witnessed top brass there talking about how there was an order for a stand-down.
[00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.823]  And we've had other leaks from inside the Pentagon, inside the military, people that don't want to go public on air.
[00:04:14.863 --> 00:04:23.609]  I've gotten the same type of info from others inside the Pentagon, inside NORTHCOM, which was set up before 9-11, by the way.
[00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:25.910]  We were covering it big time right before 9-11.
[00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:28.712]  We could see the continuity of government system being put in place.
[00:04:30.233 --> 00:04:32.475]  And this is a very serious report.
[00:04:32.575 --> 00:04:36.817]  And so instead of just denying it like many others did, we did research on it.
[00:04:36.857 --> 00:04:37.658]  We went right to...
[00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:39.260]  It was unbelievable.
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.302]  And I'll tell you who I did an interview with last night after this break.
[00:04:42.322 --> 00:04:42.922]  It's big!
[00:04:42.942 --> 00:04:43.282]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:07.552]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:07.892 --> 00:05:09.854]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.194 --> 00:05:17.880]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.561 --> 00:05:25.606]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.006 --> 00:05:28.949]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:31.651]  The White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:05:32.071 --> 00:05:32.872]  NSA spies.
[00:05:34.302 --> 00:05:37.463]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[00:05:37.723 --> 00:05:41.244]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.704 --> 00:05:43.585]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.945 --> 00:05:47.866]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:02.697 --> 00:06:03.738]  The war on terrorism.
[00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:06.843]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:07.123 --> 00:06:11.269]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:12.530]  So what do you do?
[00:06:12.851 --> 00:06:17.417]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:17.898 --> 00:06:20.019]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:35.205]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:35.245 --> 00:06:42.368]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:42.668 --> 00:06:45.829]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:52.073]  Hey, want to know a natural healing treatment that's been around for thousands of years?
[00:06:52.113 --> 00:06:52.793]  Salt products.

[00:07:23.406 --> 00:07:25.407]  Salt pipes to relieve respiratory ailments.
[00:07:25.747 --> 00:07:29.588]  Bath salts release toxins as they soften and rehydrate the skin.
[00:07:29.988 --> 00:07:33.810]  Pretty salt lamps to ionize the air and reduce EMS radiation.
[00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.571]  So many different cell products available for you.
[00:07:36.991 --> 00:07:38.531]  It's time to let the secret out.

[00:08:02.415 --> 00:08:08.437]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.038 --> 00:08:12.079]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.741 --> 00:08:22.863]  We have the Army Sergeant on who worked at Central Command.
[00:08:24.759 --> 00:08:36.162]  In Florida, on 9-11, and was in the top secret classified areas, and was witnessing open discussions by high-level brass about how they've been ordered to stand down.
[00:08:36.262 --> 00:08:37.962]  We are vetting the story so far.
[00:08:38.442 --> 00:08:48.325]  Every test we've put to it has confirmed that Lero Jones Chavez is telling the truth, and it meshes with the already available data.
[00:08:48.345 --> 00:08:49.405]  We are still vetting it.
[00:08:51.270 --> 00:09:05.845]  Since then, the neocons, since he first did a radio interview with us yesterday, an exclusive, he has had the neocons en masse calling his office, because when he wrote the letter to the editor that didn't get any attention two months ago, it's now gotten attention to the Cincinnati Post.
[00:09:07.326 --> 00:09:07.487]  He...
[00:09:09.275 --> 00:09:33.264]  Put where he worked, who he was, his name, his phone number, and so the neocons are doing what they do best, attempting to silence, trying to get Stephen Jones, the professor, the physicist fired, trying to get Kevin Barrett fired, trying to get me shut down, openly calling for my arrest on national radio, openly saying I'm a traitor, that I'm probably Al-Qaeda.
[00:09:33.504 --> 00:09:35.005]  This is how they operate.
[00:09:35.805 --> 00:09:38.286]  They're upset that we're fighting their North American Union.
[00:09:38.526 --> 00:09:40.367]  They're upset we're fighting their gun control.
[00:09:40.607 --> 00:09:42.928]  They're upset we're fighting their amnesty and open borders.
[00:09:43.188 --> 00:09:46.270]  They're upset that we're fighting their phony war of global domination.
[00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.271]  They're upset that we're exposing trillions missing from the Pentagon.
[00:09:49.591 --> 00:09:55.333]  They're upset that we're exposing them as a bunch of phony conservatives that are butchering this country.
[00:09:55.513 --> 00:09:58.695]  Hey, traitors, we're not going to stop and we're not going to shut up.
[00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:00.055]  Do you understand?
[00:10:02.616 --> 00:10:03.217]  So, L.J.,
[00:10:05.294 --> 00:10:09.717]  We'll be joining us coming up for about 10-15 minutes of the next hour.
[00:10:09.737 --> 00:10:17.561]  Then we have Selle Costello, former high-level DEA agent, Army Ranger in his own right in Vietnam, police officer.
[00:10:17.681 --> 00:10:18.281]  He's done it all.
[00:10:19.222 --> 00:10:24.965]  He'll be joining us to talk about a bunch of new developments, how they're using Latin American death squads in Iraq right now.
[00:10:26.225 --> 00:10:30.608]  Selle Costello will be in studio with us from about the middle of the next hour into the third hour.
[00:10:31.664 --> 00:10:33.045]  Always great to have Sully with us.
[00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:35.246]  We have him in the studio several times a year.
[00:10:37.507 --> 00:10:42.549]  But right now, you're probably wondering who the big interview was yesterday, last night.
[00:10:47.232 --> 00:10:49.353]  I guess there is no rest for the wicked.
[00:10:49.373 --> 00:10:51.974]  I don't really think of myself as wicked, but we're all fallen.
[00:10:53.174 --> 00:10:54.655]  There is no rest, my friends.
[00:10:55.636 --> 00:11:00.198]  I was going to have dinner with my dad who came back into town.
[00:11:00.842 --> 00:11:02.223]  I'm with my mom and a cousin.
[00:11:02.903 --> 00:11:17.968]  But I was unable to do that last night because at about 4 o'clock, when I was in here doing some research and making some phone calls, we got a phone call from Kinky Friedman's gubernatorial campaign from Laura, his press secretary.
[00:11:18.048 --> 00:11:19.549]  Really nice person.
[00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:22.170]  Very helpful.
[00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:24.871]  And we are supporting Kinky's campaign.
[00:11:24.891 --> 00:11:26.352]  I think he's better than Strayhorn.
[00:11:26.392 --> 00:11:27.232]  She can't be trusted.
[00:11:28.112 --> 00:11:28.732]  Just look at her.
[00:11:29.433 --> 00:11:29.953]  Her past
[00:11:30.743 --> 00:11:31.703]  The Bushes, all of it.
[00:11:32.404 --> 00:11:34.345]  And I certainly don't support the Democratic candidate.
[00:11:35.925 --> 00:11:41.568]  And of course I don't support Rick Tolroad, North American Union, limp-wristed Perry.
[00:11:43.809 --> 00:11:45.410]  So, compromise Perry.
[00:11:47.251 --> 00:11:58.956]  So we've had Kinky in studio, and so we had told Laura a month ago, three weeks ago when Kinky Freeman was in studio, that they told us, Juford, his campaign manager,
[00:12:02.745 --> 00:12:29.518]  And said, yeah, we've got Jesse Ventura coming in in a few weeks, and of course you know that they're advising us, and his former campaign manager is our chief strategist, our political consultant, and would you like to interview Jesse Ventura, the former governor of Minnesota, the famous Navy SEAL, the professional wrestler, the movie star of Predator, and The Running Man, two of my favorite movies.
[00:12:30.759 --> 00:12:30.899]  And
[00:12:32.176 --> 00:12:46.365]  I had tried to get in touch with Jesse Ventura about a year ago, but he was just at that time leaving his sabbatical at Harvard, and he moved to Baja, Mexico.
[00:12:46.385 --> 00:12:48.826]  He's kind of retiring down there, I guess.
[00:12:49.627 --> 00:12:51.288]  What is he, like 56 years old now?
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.000]  And just surfing and lifting weights and working out.
[00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:57.081]  That's what I'd read in the press.
[00:12:57.121 --> 00:13:00.421]  So I talked to a few contacts who personally know him or are friends with him in Minnesota.
[00:13:00.661 --> 00:13:02.061]  And they said, yeah, he's down in Mexico.
[00:13:02.081 --> 00:13:03.242]  You really can't even get a hold of him.
[00:13:04.822 --> 00:13:06.902]  So I get this call yesterday.
[00:13:08.463 --> 00:13:14.504]  And they said, well, you can get like 15 minutes at his hotel with him tonight.
[00:13:14.564 --> 00:13:16.204]  They were staying at the Manger.
[00:13:16.804 --> 00:13:22.225]  Famous hotel where the Rough Riders met and planned the invasion and the staged war with...
[00:13:23.527 --> 00:13:25.628]  Spain started in Cuba, Havana Harbor.
[00:13:25.648 --> 00:13:27.588]  That's where Teddy Roosevelt met.
[00:13:27.608 --> 00:13:31.229]  I've actually eaten and had drinks there at the Manger.
[00:13:32.149 --> 00:13:36.890]  What was it, about eight, nine months ago, we had the Watsons here in town.
[00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:42.432]  They came visiting, and I took them to see the Alamo, and we went into the Manger.
[00:13:43.012 --> 00:13:43.652]  They wanted a beer.
[00:13:43.672 --> 00:13:45.412]  You know, those evil Brits drink.
[00:13:47.233 --> 00:13:47.853]  Beautiful place.
[00:13:47.893 --> 00:13:50.314]  But again, I'm digressing here, my friends.
[00:13:50.634 --> 00:13:51.754]  As usual, I haven't had much sleep.
[00:13:53.667 --> 00:13:54.887]  And I just knew.
[00:13:54.907 --> 00:14:02.730]  I knew that if they were going to go to this big bar restaurant called the Flying Saucer, they've got all these thousands of plates on the walls, or hundreds.
[00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:03.350]  It's like a joke.
[00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:04.931]  That's why they call it the Flying Saucer.
[00:14:05.611 --> 00:14:08.152]  Nothing to do with flying saucers themselves.
[00:14:08.592 --> 00:14:11.633]  You know, the classical flying saucer with little green men you think of.
[00:14:12.794 --> 00:14:14.254]  And I knew.
[00:14:14.274 --> 00:14:21.877]  I said, if they were going to supposedly get there at 5.30, and of course they got there late because they'd been speaking at a packed house at a university there in San Antonio, the thousands.
[00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:28.385]  I just knew that they would get tired and wouldn't want to do it at the hotel.
[00:14:29.025 --> 00:14:31.266]  I wanted to get it there, on the spot.
[00:14:32.266 --> 00:14:33.106]  So we show up about 6.30.
[00:14:33.767 --> 00:14:34.507]  We leave here about 5.
[00:14:34.767 --> 00:14:36.488]  We show up about 6.30 in San Antonio.
[00:14:36.528 --> 00:14:40.229]  I drive like a maniac through traffic to get there, like it was the Indy 500.
[00:14:40.909 --> 00:14:42.410]  I get there, and it's hurry up and wait.
[00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:53.174]  There's about 600 people just in the line in this huge restaurant bar, lined up, wanting to shake hands and get autographs with Jesse Ventura and Kinky Friedman.
[00:14:57.614 --> 00:15:03.156]  And I'm sitting there the whole time, and I know Paul Watson's taking notes right now.
[00:15:03.596 --> 00:15:06.937]  I don't want to put this in the article, all these little details that would just clutter it up.
[00:15:07.457 --> 00:15:20.421]  I guess the headline should be something like, Former Governor Jesse Ventura questions official 9-11 story.
[00:15:22.361 --> 00:15:24.562]  And then under it, points out, or...
[00:15:27.305 --> 00:15:28.405]  Some turn of the phrase.
[00:15:28.745 --> 00:15:29.366]  Sounds good.
[00:15:31.606 --> 00:15:46.831]  Points to Operation Northwoods or points to points towards points to Gulf of Tonkin dash Operation Northwoods dash NORAD stand down.
[00:15:48.992 --> 00:15:54.073]  And then go into the body of the article and let me just as best I can go over the interview.
[00:15:55.534 --> 00:15:56.734]  So I'm there for
[00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:04.994]  I guess until about 9.30 at night, well, it had to be over 1,000 people went through there.
[00:16:05.034 --> 00:16:08.596]  It was about 600 at one time lined up, and the line just kept replenishing itself.
[00:16:09.777 --> 00:16:15.240]  So basically it was hurry up and wait, and I'm sitting there talking to Juford, his campaign manager, and we're all just standing around.
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:19.223]  It's a great crowd of people, very diverse crowd, you know, populist there.
[00:16:19.243 --> 00:16:19.303]  And...
[00:16:24.398 --> 00:16:26.620]  I just knew Ventura had seen my documentaries.
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.521]  Because I would feel somebody looking at me.
[00:16:28.561 --> 00:16:29.702]  I'd be sitting there in my chair.
[00:16:30.042 --> 00:16:32.424]  Every time I'd turn around, Ventura was like looking at me.
[00:16:32.464 --> 00:16:34.586]  I mean, this guy's something else in person, by the way.
[00:16:35.827 --> 00:16:37.448]  He looked pretty menacing.
[00:16:38.028 --> 00:16:39.089]  He's got quite a presence.
[00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:45.153]  And you know how it is when somebody's looking at you, you feel it, especially when they've got a presence.
[00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:46.014]  And I kept turning.
[00:16:46.634 --> 00:16:49.196]  And like all night long, Ventura, and again, don't put this in the article.
[00:16:49.216 --> 00:16:49.937]  This is just for listeners.
[00:16:51.121 --> 00:16:56.527]  Ventura is just continually staring at me, and I don't want to go up to him with a big crowd and say, hey, I'm interviewing you later.
[00:16:56.547 --> 00:17:00.192]  I just had Juford and Kinky go over and say, hey, this is Alex Jones.
[00:17:00.212 --> 00:17:00.632]  He's a good guy.
[00:17:00.652 --> 00:17:03.395]  We did an interview, and they said, will you do it at the hotel?
[00:17:03.435 --> 00:17:04.156]  And he said, fine.
[00:17:04.937 --> 00:17:06.319]  And I just said, all right, we'll talk to you later.
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.964]  The whole time, there's all this other TV and radios all there, a whole bunch of cameras.
[00:17:11.778 --> 00:17:12.538]  He's not looking at them.
[00:17:12.558 --> 00:17:14.499]  He keeps looking at me, obviously, because he knows about 9-11.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.440]  He's on record already questioning 9-11.
[00:17:17.001 --> 00:17:20.423]  On Jay Leno, briefly, just saying, hey, we're being lied to about a lot of things.
[00:17:20.443 --> 00:17:22.344]  9-11, you name it, just question.
[00:17:22.724 --> 00:17:28.747]  On a radio show interview last year, 2005, he brought up NORAD and said, I've got questions about that.
[00:17:29.027 --> 00:17:33.149]  But he's never gone as far as he did last night with us.
[00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:38.612]  And I knew he was holding back once I actually interviewed him.
[00:17:38.672 --> 00:17:39.973]  But I appreciate him doing the interview.
[00:17:40.583 --> 00:17:43.464]  There's this little bitty manager's office.
[00:17:44.785 --> 00:17:46.606]  You know how these big restaurants slash bars are.
[00:17:46.666 --> 00:17:53.349]  It would be a huge facility to have this tiny little office that you can fit about four people in, like sardines.
[00:17:53.389 --> 00:17:57.892]  So this big old six-foot-six, 300-pound Ventura.
[00:18:02.694 --> 00:18:03.234]  He's done.
[00:18:03.254 --> 00:18:05.616]  I said, hey, you want to take a break at the bathroom or something?
[00:18:05.636 --> 00:18:06.856]  You've been up there for four hours.
[00:18:06.896 --> 00:18:08.257]  He said, no, let's just do it right now.
[00:18:08.637 --> 00:18:10.178]  So we go back there in the back room.
[00:18:11.886 --> 00:18:15.427]  We set him down, we aimed the cameras at him, we've already got it all set up, got the lights set up.
[00:18:17.207 --> 00:18:23.689]  I think, I mean, I was thinking this, and after the interview, we're driving down the road, and they go, man, he seemed like he was freaked out by you.
[00:18:23.709 --> 00:18:25.409]  I could tell he was holding back.
[00:18:25.469 --> 00:18:26.470]  He wanted to say more.
[00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:29.890]  And I got him in the chair.
[00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:30.871]  You just had to see it.
[00:18:31.191 --> 00:18:35.072]  What I'm going to do is I'm going to put out a quick edit, compilation, short video.
[00:18:35.092 --> 00:18:36.172]  It's a 25-minute interview.
[00:18:37.532 --> 00:18:39.453]  I'm going to put out like a short 8, 9, 10-minute one tonight.
[00:18:40.876 --> 00:18:44.377]  And then in the next few days, we'll put out the whole interview.
[00:18:47.498 --> 00:18:48.479]  And it was incredible.
[00:18:49.519 --> 00:18:50.279]  It was incredible.
[00:18:50.519 --> 00:18:52.980]  And you could see him sitting there struggling with wanting to say more.
[00:18:55.021 --> 00:19:06.765]  I brought up Jay Leno first, and I said, well, back in May of 2003, you were on Jay Leno, and you jumped up out of your chair.
[00:19:06.785 --> 00:19:08.365]  I'm trying to find the audio of this.
[00:19:08.506 --> 00:19:09.766]  I remember seeing it, and I'm
[00:19:10.603 --> 00:19:12.525]  I have the dickens of a time finding it online.
[00:19:12.545 --> 00:19:15.748]  Maybe you guys can help us out there in radio land.
[00:19:15.768 --> 00:19:23.056]  And then go post it on my MySpace account or email it to tips at infowars.com or Aaron at infowars.com.
[00:19:25.258 --> 00:19:32.986]  But he was, I mean, just to give you some background, he was on Jay Leno, and to paraphrase what he said, Jay Leno's just talking about some other subject.
[00:19:33.006 --> 00:19:33.987]  When we get back, I'll tell you about it.
[00:19:37.042 --> 00:19:41.605]  And then we've got the little blurbs, the little comedy made on a radio show, but he said a lot more.
[00:19:41.705 --> 00:19:42.786]  He brought up Northwoods.
[00:19:43.747 --> 00:19:45.388]  He brought up Gulf of Tonkin.
[00:19:46.028 --> 00:19:47.770]  He brought it all up together.
[00:19:50.111 --> 00:19:52.313]  And it was, it's important.
[00:19:52.333 --> 00:19:56.336]  I mean, Jesse Ventura, questions official 9-11 story.
[00:19:56.996 --> 00:19:58.077]  We'll go over it when we get back.
[00:20:01.383 --> 00:20:06.464]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:20:06.524 --> 00:20:13.826]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:20:13.986 --> 00:20:21.848]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine.
[00:20:24.809 --> 00:20:29.411]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:20:29.651 --> 00:20:34.633]  Unbelievably, they even remove small microparticulate from water like food coloring particles.
[00:20:34.853 --> 00:20:37.794]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:20:38.014 --> 00:20:47.838]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[00:21:01.124 --> 00:21:02.084]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:02.184 --> 00:21:06.966]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:21:07.126 --> 00:21:14.930]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:20.552]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:21:20.772 --> 00:21:27.755]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:21:27.995 --> 00:21:28.535]  We're good to go.
[00:21:46.642 --> 00:21:47.763]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:47.803 --> 00:21:49.344]  Patrick Henry said, give me liberty or give me death.
[00:22:07.668 --> 00:22:23.820]  Did you know that he also forced the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a part of the Constitution of 1787 to guarantee your unalienable or unchangeable rights of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to own a gun to protect our nation from tyranny?
[00:22:24.781 --> 00:22:29.985]  There is now an assault upon the unalienable, unchangeable rights to deprive you of them.
[00:22:30.808 --> 00:22:38.730]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:22:40.651 --> 00:22:42.031]  The call is free.

[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:05.502]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:23:05.982 --> 00:23:08.424]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[00:23:09.205 --> 00:23:17.632]  The best kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[00:23:18.593 --> 00:23:23.457]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Incorporated's patented methodology.
[00:23:24.119 --> 00:23:34.109]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:36.912]  Star War technology at its best.
[00:23:37.693 --> 00:23:38.934]  For more information, call 702-953-0267.
[00:23:38.954 --> 00:23:38.994]  702-953-0267.
[00:23:47.674 --> 00:23:51.956]  Alright my friends, here is the long and short of the Jesse
[00:24:13.507 --> 00:24:20.997]  The Mind Ventura interview, the unexpected interview that materialized at about 4.15 yesterday.
[00:24:21.078 --> 00:24:24.162]  We, again, jumped in the car, shot down to San Antonio, hurry up and wait.
[00:24:24.763 --> 00:24:27.847]  And then I just thought, you know, I'm not going to try to go to his hotel and do this.
[00:24:27.867 --> 00:24:28.608]  He's going to be too tired.
[00:24:28.628 --> 00:24:30.030]  I said, let's just do this here.
[00:24:31.056 --> 00:24:32.037]  So we changed plans.
[00:24:32.277 --> 00:24:33.197]  I went and asked the manager.
[00:24:33.578 --> 00:24:35.199]  Went back, got their tiny office.
[00:24:35.659 --> 00:24:36.099]  Shut up.
[00:24:36.199 --> 00:24:39.862]  Right when he went off stage, after hours, it was really friendly.
[00:24:39.882 --> 00:24:42.943]  He spent like 10 minutes with some people up there talking to him.
[00:24:43.464 --> 00:24:44.785]  Most people he spent about a minute with.
[00:24:46.606 --> 00:24:52.910]  Really nice compared to a lot of celebrities I've seen who go to these meet and greet events.
[00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:57.092]  So he shuffles into the back with us, sits down.
[00:24:57.112 --> 00:24:59.374]  I go right into, hey, I've heard you've questioned 9-11.
[00:25:00.954 --> 00:25:04.195]  And he said, well, I don't remember exactly saying that on Jay Leno.
[00:25:04.235 --> 00:25:05.455]  And I said, well, you did.
[00:25:06.435 --> 00:25:10.236]  And he said, yeah, well, I mean, I do have questions.
[00:25:10.276 --> 00:25:10.916]  Yes, I do.
[00:25:11.856 --> 00:25:14.977]  And then he went on, and this is the basic key points of what he said.
[00:25:14.997 --> 00:25:17.778]  And this is what's important.
[00:25:17.798 --> 00:25:19.158]  He never talked about Northwoods.
[00:25:19.638 --> 00:25:22.359]  Not on Jay Leno, not on the other radio interview he did.
[00:25:23.479 --> 00:25:27.360]  He said, well, Operation Northwoods, our own government in the early 60s,
[00:25:28.527 --> 00:25:29.027]  We're good to go.
[00:25:54.933 --> 00:26:13.761]  And basically a recap of, you know, he lost friends in that war, and it was just really upsetting to know that he joined the Navy and went into the Navy SEALs on September 11, 1969, as a volunteer to go fight in a war that later he learned was totally staged and was a lie.
[00:26:13.781 --> 00:26:19.943]  And he went on to say that the Vietnamese were always going to win because they were fighting for their freedom and we were fighting against their freedom.
[00:26:20.604 --> 00:26:23.705]  But he said, if we could have a Gulf of Tonkin...
[00:26:25.299 --> 00:26:28.180]  And have them lie, and it worked then and brought us to war.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:34.501]  Why wouldn't they stage something again today to bring us into war if it worked before?
[00:26:35.101 --> 00:26:35.862]  Pretty important.
[00:26:36.602 --> 00:26:44.524]  That's a paraphrase, but that's basically what he said, was that it worked before, and so why wouldn't it work again?
[00:26:44.544 --> 00:26:46.564]  And that's why he was questioning 9-11.
[00:26:46.604 --> 00:26:53.426]  Was Operation Northwoods, and then knowing that Gulf of Tonkin was staged to get us full bore into the Vietnam War...
[00:26:54.350 --> 00:27:14.394]  And then he brought up Payne Stewart that within a half hour, and it's really less than that, of them finding out the plane was off course, they had F-16 fighters on the wing of that depressurized small jet, private passenger jet.
[00:27:16.591 --> 00:27:16.972]  We're good to go.
[00:27:36.051 --> 00:27:40.393]  On 9-11, saying, hey, we've been lied to in the past.
[00:27:40.973 --> 00:27:42.453]  Don't believe what you're hearing now.
[00:27:42.993 --> 00:27:43.874]  Be skeptical.
[00:27:43.994 --> 00:27:45.574]  We got lied to about Gulf of Tonkin.
[00:27:45.634 --> 00:27:46.575]  Don't trust 9-11.
[00:27:47.535 --> 00:27:50.456]  That's what he basically said in a nutshell on Jay Leno.
[00:27:50.476 --> 00:27:54.357]  He got up, stood up, was all emotional about it, and he said, you know, they know who I am.
[00:27:54.377 --> 00:27:55.177]  They know where I live.
[00:27:55.197 --> 00:27:56.418]  They can come get me if they want.
[00:27:57.098 --> 00:27:59.359]  And he said something similar to that in the interview.
[00:27:59.979 --> 00:28:00.859]  He seemed upset.
[00:28:00.959 --> 00:28:03.500]  He was saying, you know, I spent...
[00:28:04.662 --> 00:28:08.183]  Four years in the military, most of it in Vietnam.
[00:28:08.263 --> 00:28:13.944]  I spent time as a mayor and then time as a governor.
[00:28:14.065 --> 00:28:17.766]  I've served 14 years for this country.
[00:28:18.346 --> 00:28:22.827]  And he said, I'm down in Mexico now and I'm surfing and I'm running and I'm lifting weights.
[00:28:22.867 --> 00:28:25.047]  And he did look good compared to when he was governor.
[00:28:25.067 --> 00:28:25.808]  He was a little chubby.
[00:28:25.828 --> 00:28:26.928]  I mean, he was just...
[00:28:27.861 --> 00:28:31.362]  He was wearing a baggy t-shirt, but I was in there standing over him in the interview, and I looked at his chest.
[00:28:31.382 --> 00:28:34.283]  It was just rippled, solid muscle.
[00:28:34.663 --> 00:28:37.324]  Super good shape for a 56-year-old man.
[00:28:37.925 --> 00:28:40.285]  And he looks totally wild now.
[00:28:40.325 --> 00:28:45.707]  He's got black dreadlocks and a Captain Morgan pirate beard.
[00:28:46.648 --> 00:28:49.329]  And he just came right out and said, Look, I've served.
[00:28:49.349 --> 00:28:51.590]  I said, Well, should there be another investigation on 9-11?
[00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:54.811]  He goes, Well, the first one wasn't independent.
[00:28:54.851 --> 00:28:55.511]  Oh, that was another thing.
[00:28:57.161 --> 00:29:03.464]  He said, well, the first one isn't independent, appointed by Bush, and so what makes you think they'll ever be an independent one?
[00:29:03.925 --> 00:29:05.986]  Has there ever been a real independent investigation?
[00:29:06.566 --> 00:29:07.587]  I said, I guess there hasn't.
[00:29:07.607 --> 00:29:08.608]  He goes, well, there's your answer.
[00:29:08.628 --> 00:29:09.508]  You're not going to get one.
[00:29:10.749 --> 00:29:12.370]  He was fighting back in 2003.
[00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:25.238]  It seemed like he was more angry, and now he's just like, basically, he said the American people are apathetic, and a lot of my criticism rests on them letting this happen to the country.
[00:29:26.445 --> 00:29:30.788]  And he just said, I'm surfing, and you know what?
[00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:35.411]  Basically, he was saying, they'll come get me.
[00:29:36.832 --> 00:29:38.233]  He was just saying, look, man.
[00:29:38.253 --> 00:29:40.134]  I mean, they're doing this interview.
[00:29:40.254 --> 00:29:42.095]  Obviously, I question the official story.
[00:29:42.535 --> 00:29:46.478]  Northwoods, Tonkin, NORAD stand down.
[00:29:47.138 --> 00:29:48.099]  What do you want from me?
[00:29:51.721 --> 00:29:52.622]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.102 --> 00:29:54.623]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.618 --> 00:29:58.400]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.082 --> 00:30:04.583]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:30:04.683 --> 00:30:07.065]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[00:30:07.125 --> 00:30:14.189]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote unquote.
[00:30:14.789 --> 00:30:17.070]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:30:17.731 --> 00:30:21.213]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:30:21.821 --> 00:30:25.963]  The truth is, is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:30:26.523 --> 00:30:29.504]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:30:30.484 --> 00:30:33.385]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:30:34.126 --> 00:30:36.747]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:30:36.887 --> 00:30:37.367]  That's 1-888-892-6238.
[00:30:37.467 --> 00:30:40.108]  For the following two free reports, U.S.
[00:30:40.128 --> 00:30:42.469]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[00:30:51.986 --> 00:30:59.860]  Call 888-8XANADU, that's 888-8XANADU, and ask for George.
[00:31:02.239 --> 00:31:06.883]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:31:07.243 --> 00:31:11.467]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:31:11.767 --> 00:31:12.327]  We listened.
[00:31:12.648 --> 00:31:17.772]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:31:18.072 --> 00:31:18.553]  We listened.
[00:31:18.953 --> 00:31:22.096]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:31:22.516 --> 00:31:23.076]  We listened.
[00:31:23.557 --> 00:31:27.500]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:31:28.961 --> 00:31:34.364]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:31:34.785 --> 00:31:36.206]  Again, we listened.
[00:31:36.566 --> 00:31:44.111]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:31:44.591 --> 00:31:47.294]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water purifier.
[00:31:47.515 --> 00:31:47.715]  Only $279.
[00:31:47.775 --> 00:31:48.376]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[00:31:48.416 --> 00:31:48.676]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:31:48.736 --> 00:31:50.398]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:31:50.418 --> 00:31:51.399]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:32:01.286 --> 00:32:04.408]  We understand that decisions related to health can be overwhelming.
[00:32:04.668 --> 00:32:11.472]  That is why at ResearchedHerbs.com we take pride in offering you herbs whose safety and effectiveness have been proven time and time again.
[00:32:11.912 --> 00:32:25.280]  For example, did you know that LIV52, the top-selling natural herbal supplement for liver diseases since 1930, is backed by over 300 research studies and clinical trials and prescribed by more than 200,000 health professionals worldwide?
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:29.342]  In fact, the effectiveness of all the herbs featured on ResearchedHerbs.com
[00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:30.730]  We're good to go.
[00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:31.051]  I think?
[00:33:13.454 --> 00:33:22.001]  Coming up, about 20 minutes into the next hour, we're going to have Celica Stello in the studio.
[00:33:22.962 --> 00:33:30.468]  He was an Army sniper in Vietnam, then went into the Sheriff's Department down on the Texas border, was a police officer.
[00:33:31.354 --> 00:33:39.700]  Peace officer, and then of course got recruited into the DEA, was the head DEA agent in Latin America, and witnessed government narcotics trafficking and a lot more.
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.602]  But he's going to be tying it into Negroponte, the People's Administration today.
[00:33:43.162 --> 00:33:47.065]  Latin American death squads they've hired to take over to Iraq and other places.
[00:33:47.785 --> 00:33:53.369]  And he's going to be giving a speech here in Central Texas very soon, so he's also here to promote that.
[00:33:55.231 --> 00:33:59.894]  We have Laro Jones Chavez, or LJ as he's known.
[00:34:00.646 --> 00:34:20.723]  Joining us, we had him on yesterday to talk about how he worked in CENTCOM on 9-11, Central Command, there in Tampa, and what he witnessed, the brass talking about how they've been ordered to stand down, amongst other things, and the brass standing around going, look at those buildings, they have bombs in them.
[00:34:21.684 --> 00:34:22.705]  Just an amazing interview.
[00:34:22.725 --> 00:34:28.890]  He's going to join us with a few of the things he didn't have time to talk about yesterday and to talk about how the neocons are calling up his work.
[00:34:29.494 --> 00:34:30.694]  Trying to get him fired.
[00:34:31.915 --> 00:34:32.875]  That's how they operate.
[00:34:33.975 --> 00:34:34.716]  That's what they do.
[00:34:36.236 --> 00:34:38.257]  We're going to boycott you.
[00:34:39.597 --> 00:34:41.118]  We want you to fire him.
[00:34:44.679 --> 00:34:46.079]  It's amazing.
[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:57.983]  I do have some other observations about my interview last night with Jesse Ventura, the former governor of Minnesota, the former Hollywood star, the former Navy SEAL from the Vietnam era.
[00:34:58.775 --> 00:35:00.816]  There are a few other observations and things he said.
[00:35:01.496 --> 00:35:06.699]  Paul's going to write an article about it today that will be out tonight.
[00:35:07.579 --> 00:35:11.822]  And we're going to stay late here at the office with the footage we've got.
[00:35:11.882 --> 00:35:13.342]  We're capturing it right now.
[00:35:13.362 --> 00:35:15.223]  Then we've got to edit it.
[00:35:15.263 --> 00:35:18.845]  Then we've got to upload it and convert it and do all this stuff.
[00:35:18.885 --> 00:35:20.406]  But it should be up there.
[00:35:21.181 --> 00:35:21.721]  We're good to go.
[00:35:49.173 --> 00:35:52.294]  Questioning the official 9-11 story.
[00:35:52.314 --> 00:35:57.955]  And I want to say my crew did a great job on short notice going down there with me to cover that.
[00:35:58.556 --> 00:36:07.458]  Ventura today at 1 o'clock at Southwest Texas in San Marcos will be speaking with Kinky Friedman again in one of the big student halls.
[00:36:07.478 --> 00:36:11.539]  If you go to Kinky Friedman's website, you can find out exactly which hall and where.
[00:36:12.019 --> 00:36:16.600]  And from there they go to Houston for an event tonight.
[00:36:16.741 --> 00:36:18.221]  And then Ventura goes back to
[00:36:19.347 --> 00:36:21.629]  We're good to go.
[00:36:43.857 --> 00:36:47.558]  It's there in the general news section on the main page of prisonplanet.com.
[00:36:47.598 --> 00:36:49.019]  It's up on infowars.com.
[00:36:49.439 --> 00:36:50.740]  One of the top stories as well.
[00:36:53.161 --> 00:37:00.543]  About a month and a half ago, we uploaded a high-quality version of Terror Storm to Google Video for free.
[00:37:02.004 --> 00:37:03.945]  That's our goal here, to get the information out.
[00:37:04.925 --> 00:37:08.786]  Great listeners, within one day of my L.A.
[00:37:08.826 --> 00:37:12.908]  conference, though, before we had even put the film out officially, got the
[00:37:14.486 --> 00:37:21.973]  Symposium version that was a little bit longer and wasn't as tightly edited or, frankly, as... Well, it's a collector's item.
[00:37:21.993 --> 00:37:23.074]  I don't want to say it's not as good.
[00:37:23.114 --> 00:37:23.614]  It's just different.
[00:37:24.035 --> 00:37:30.200]  And they had uploaded it in low quality to Google Video, and that was the one that had gotten most of the traffic.
[00:37:31.541 --> 00:37:38.047]  I mean, there were something like 20-something bad versions up there that people had encoded themselves or uploaded wrong.
[00:37:38.067 --> 00:37:38.948]  I mean, it didn't look bad.
[00:37:38.988 --> 00:37:39.868]  It was a little bit fuzzy.
[00:37:40.049 --> 00:37:41.550]  It wasn't as good as the version we uploaded.
[00:37:45.562 --> 00:37:58.547]  But of all those versions, it was 20 plus versions up there, one would have 200 and something thousand had downloaded it, 180,000, 170,000, 150,000, 140,000, 130,000, something, you know, 80,000, 20,000, 10,000.
[00:37:59.868 --> 00:38:07.111]  Our high quality version, I started it a couple weeks ago saying, hey folks, go to my high quality version.
[00:38:07.171 --> 00:38:10.233]  Well, obviously, that's not the way the web works.
[00:38:10.313 --> 00:38:13.014]  Whatever gets picked up first is what gets the biggest, so...
[00:38:13.661 --> 00:38:19.805]  All those other versions were getting watched a bunch, and ours had gotten only up to about 65,000 as of last Friday.
[00:38:21.426 --> 00:38:26.269]  And I was frustrated because if we're going to put something out for free, you might as well put something good out for free to have the most effect.
[00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:32.794]  And you've already heard the story, but it's important I need to recap it and add a few new developments.
[00:38:34.255 --> 00:38:39.078]  So I get into the KLBJ studios Sunday, a couple hours before getting ready for my Sunday radio show.
[00:38:39.901 --> 00:38:40.862]  We're good to go.
[00:38:59.992 --> 00:39:00.392]  Well, guess what?
[00:39:29.938 --> 00:39:30.338]  We're good to go.
[00:39:30.358 --> 00:39:30.899]  We're good to go.
[00:39:55.703 --> 00:39:56.123]  I'll never know.
[00:40:23.539 --> 00:40:27.821]  Literally, 97% of the phone calls are routed through an Israeli company.
[00:40:27.841 --> 00:40:29.182]  They know all the caller ID.
[00:40:29.442 --> 00:40:31.402]  White House security is run by an Israeli company.
[00:40:31.663 --> 00:40:32.343]  All their encryption.
[00:40:32.363 --> 00:40:33.463]  That's why they blackmail.
[00:40:33.483 --> 00:40:34.444]  But, side issue.
[00:40:34.464 --> 00:40:38.626]  The point is, Google has this motto, Don't Be Evil.
[00:40:38.666 --> 00:40:43.788]  And I saw a listener on a message board on MySpace saying, Yeah, their new motto is, Be Evil and...
[00:40:44.517 --> 00:40:47.782]  Make people think you're good, basically, is their motto.
[00:40:48.102 --> 00:40:54.631]  And we've caught them when our Charlie Sheen story is on Drudge Report and everywhere and getting millions of hits, and that's what drives stuff on the web.
[00:40:54.811 --> 00:41:00.599]  You know, a week later, it's the Charlie Sheen story isn't on Google Web, much less Google News.
[00:41:00.959 --> 00:41:02.901]  Manipulating what you can see of the work we've done.
[00:41:24.445 --> 00:41:27.886]  And Google is bigger now than Yahoo when it comes to search engines.
[00:41:27.966 --> 00:41:30.347]  It's what, like number two on the web now.
[00:41:30.407 --> 00:41:33.688]  It's about to supplant Yahoo, and Yahoo does similar stuff.
[00:41:33.988 --> 00:41:42.730]  And Google and Yahoo both went to China, and they both did deals agreeing to censor and control and to report people and not let free speech go on.
[00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:44.431]  And so they're doing it there.
[00:41:44.471 --> 00:41:47.871]  They're sure as heck going to do it here.
[00:41:48.332 --> 00:41:53.353]  In fact, they run their Google China out of Silicon Valley.
[00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:57.733]  And so right here in America, in those very same offices, they're doing that.
[00:41:58.954 --> 00:42:00.034]  And now they're doing it to us.
[00:42:00.835 --> 00:42:06.019]  And it's frustrating because we would be able to clean the New World Order's clocks.
[00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:09.502]  I mean, in the past, we said you have to get the DVD.
[00:42:09.963 --> 00:42:11.844]  Or you have to be a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[00:42:12.385 --> 00:42:15.027]  Because we can't put it out for free and pay for the bandwidth.
[00:42:15.107 --> 00:42:17.329]  If we ever could, we'd put it out for free.
[00:42:18.616 --> 00:42:22.719]  And we have the opportunity now with Google Video, and so we did what we said we'd do.
[00:42:22.779 --> 00:42:25.040]  The goal here is to defeat the globalists.
[00:42:26.001 --> 00:42:26.841]  To save this country.
[00:42:28.362 --> 00:42:29.363]  We're going to go to Debbie in a minute.
[00:42:29.403 --> 00:42:30.544]  I've just got to make this key point.
[00:42:33.786 --> 00:42:40.250]  And so we go, we make the film, we do it, we get out there in the competition, out there in the marketplace of ideas.
[00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:41.571]  We start winning.
[00:42:42.611 --> 00:42:45.133]  And we run a touchdown, and we're about to run another touchdown.
[00:42:46.164 --> 00:42:48.026]  And we've got the momentum, and they say, Stop!
[00:42:48.126 --> 00:42:49.887]  We're taking your points off the board.
[00:42:50.948 --> 00:42:52.109]  You've got to start over.
[00:42:52.309 --> 00:42:52.930]  Well, you know what?
[00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:54.030]  We are going to start over.
[00:42:54.531 --> 00:43:00.976]  And it doesn't matter how many times you knock our ranking down, or probably next step we'll just be completely taking the videos off, and they have been jerking some for some reason.
[00:43:02.837 --> 00:43:03.178]  Fine.
[00:43:03.218 --> 00:43:04.859]  You go ahead and you just try that.
[00:43:05.059 --> 00:43:07.101]  I guarantee you our listeners now are going to get angry.
[00:43:07.884 --> 00:43:19.254]  And they're going to go get the high quality version off of PrisonPlanet.com, the high quality link to the Google video, and you're going to post it and you're going to email it and you're going to tell everybody about it because we're not going to let them get away with this.
[00:43:20.074 --> 00:43:20.535]  You understand?
[00:43:20.755 --> 00:43:28.141]  By knocking our ranking down, we don't go into the top 100 and their main page that has, what is it, 100 million people a month plus going to it.
[00:43:29.482 --> 00:43:30.223]  See how that works?
[00:43:31.423 --> 00:43:32.903]  They can't let us win.
[00:43:32.923 --> 00:43:34.224]  They're trying to regulate the web.
[00:43:34.244 --> 00:43:35.804]  They're trying to sneak around and censor.
[00:43:36.124 --> 00:43:37.745]  They're trying to get rid of net neutrality.
[00:43:37.925 --> 00:43:40.466]  They're saying the web will be dead within two years as we know it.
[00:43:40.806 --> 00:43:43.547]  That's the official line out of their own documents.
[00:43:43.567 --> 00:43:47.088]  The mainstream media says 2010 with InternetTube.
[00:43:49.368 --> 00:43:51.829]  And we've got to strike while the iron's hot.
[00:43:52.269 --> 00:43:53.029]  We've got YouTube.
[00:43:53.069 --> 00:43:55.070]  We've got Google Video right now.
[00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:58.111]  And people keep telling me, well, you should just put your thing on YouTube.
[00:43:58.823 --> 00:44:00.244]  You know, they don't censor us bad.
[00:44:00.284 --> 00:44:01.344]  Well, number one, that's not true.
[00:44:02.024 --> 00:44:13.208]  And number two, we did break it into, what, 10 different, or it's more than that, it's like 11 or 12 different 10-minute segments on YouTube.
[00:44:13.548 --> 00:44:14.869]  We did do that at the same time.
[00:44:16.129 --> 00:44:19.850]  We encoded, we broke it in 10-minute parts, and yes, it's up there.
[00:44:20.791 --> 00:44:21.131]  Okay?
[00:44:22.431 --> 00:44:22.952]  It is there.
[00:44:23.372 --> 00:44:24.052]  We did do that.
[00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:30.965]  I mean, I pay people to sit there for hours encoding video up to YouTube to then put it out for free.
[00:44:31.425 --> 00:44:31.945]  You understand?
[00:44:33.907 --> 00:44:35.068]  And I'm not tooting my own horn.
[00:44:35.148 --> 00:44:36.089]  I'm just doing my job.
[00:44:36.129 --> 00:44:37.330]  I'm doing what I'm supposed to here.
[00:44:39.391 --> 00:44:44.255]  We've got murdering terrorists that are in control of our country that are sure to stage more terror attacks if we don't expose them.
[00:44:44.515 --> 00:44:45.616]  I'm trying to save lives here.
[00:44:46.525 --> 00:44:57.111]  And I think I need you guys and gals, I know most of you do have your heads screwed on straight, some of you more than I, to really realize that we're hurting them, but that they're fighting back, and that I need you to fight them harder than ever right now.
[00:44:58.792 --> 00:44:59.612]  Now is the time.
[00:45:00.533 --> 00:45:02.734]  This isn't a joke, it isn't a game, it isn't a drill.
[00:45:04.695 --> 00:45:13.500]  If we can get 20, 30 million people, already several million, to download it just on Google Video alone, it will become a phenomenon, it will have a massive cultural effect.
[00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:16.700]  Okay?
[00:45:17.601 --> 00:45:19.583]  And it's already doing that, so they cheat us.
[00:45:20.143 --> 00:45:20.803]  They cheat us.
[00:45:20.864 --> 00:45:23.005]  They can't fight us fair and square.
[00:45:23.245 --> 00:45:25.827]  The people want the truth, and so they do stuff like this.
[00:45:25.867 --> 00:45:26.928]  So there's another way to get around them.
[00:45:27.188 --> 00:45:35.575]  Go get the high-quality DVDs from InfoWars.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139 and make copies off the DVD.
[00:45:35.815 --> 00:45:36.996]  It's a lot more effective than the web.
[00:45:38.493 --> 00:45:42.814]  And yes, PrisonPlanet.tv has it in super high quality, even better than what we have on Google.
[00:45:42.994 --> 00:45:44.394]  And I call it high quality on Google.
[00:45:44.714 --> 00:45:47.615]  They still downgrade it for bandwidth, but it's pretty darn good.
[00:45:48.335 --> 00:45:51.336]  But you get everything at PrisonPlanet.tv, so please be members.
[00:45:52.156 --> 00:45:53.196]  Please continue your memberships.
[00:45:53.236 --> 00:45:56.917]  Go look at everything we have to offer there, because we do need your funds to continue here.
[00:45:57.737 --> 00:45:57.957]  All right?
[00:45:58.577 --> 00:45:58.997]  That simple.
[00:45:59.558 --> 00:46:05.399]  Let's go to a great sponsor for about four minutes, and we'll go to break, come back, and take a few calls, and then we'll get our...
[00:46:06.883 --> 00:46:09.304]  Mr. Chavez on with an update on what he's going through now.
[00:46:10.185 --> 00:46:12.606]  Since he went public on what he saw in CENTCOM on 9-11.
[00:46:12.666 --> 00:46:15.627]  We've got Sully Costello joining us as well, my good friend.
[00:46:16.528 --> 00:46:19.569]  And I'll tell you more about my Jesse Ventura interview last night.
[00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:22.110]  Tomorrow we'll be airing clips of it here on air.
[00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:23.271]  We'll just air the whole thing.
[00:46:24.471 --> 00:46:27.333]  And snip out a few of the profanities.
[00:46:28.093 --> 00:46:31.214]  And then it'll be up on the web.
[00:46:31.275 --> 00:46:32.155]  It should be up on the web tonight.
[00:46:32.651 --> 00:46:33.612]  But go on to Debbie Morrow.
[00:46:33.672 --> 00:46:36.095]  Debbie, thanks for holding for 10 minutes while I was ranting.
[00:46:36.416 --> 00:46:37.137]  Good to talk to you.
[00:46:37.657 --> 00:46:41.121]  Alex, thank you for having me, and I didn't think you were ranting at all.
[00:46:41.342 --> 00:46:46.548]  I really am glad that I get to hear once in a while what's going on.
[00:46:49.045 --> 00:46:50.347]  Thank you for having me.
[00:46:50.727 --> 00:46:52.128]  I appreciate it very much.
[00:47:06.235 --> 00:47:07.016]  It's been a while.
[00:47:07.396 --> 00:47:13.579]  And you guys, you handle for the national manufacturer and the distributor of the American Berkey, and you have the British Berkeys.
[00:47:13.599 --> 00:47:20.003]  You have the American Stainless, the British Stainless, but I like the American model better, the latest technology.
[00:47:20.143 --> 00:47:22.884]  Tell us about the system, why we need it, and what it does, Debbie.
[00:47:23.225 --> 00:47:32.690]  Well, the Berkey gravity filters, one of the main benefits of them is you do not require any water pressure to use them.
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:35.801]  You don't have to hook them up to any plumbing.
[00:47:36.821 --> 00:47:39.622]  And you don't have to pay a plumber to come out and install them.
[00:47:39.662 --> 00:47:41.703]  You can take them with you anywhere you go.
[00:47:42.643 --> 00:47:45.524]  And they last a very, very long time.
[00:47:45.544 --> 00:47:48.425]  And the maintenance is very low on them.
[00:47:49.505 --> 00:47:56.267]  And they give you the highest quality water that they have found through Gravity Water Filter.
[00:47:56.307 --> 00:48:00.829]  We actually take the contaminants out to a non-detectable level
[00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:12.673]  So the Berkey water filter systems really do have an effective, you know, they really do affect your life because you're putting good, healthy water into your system.
[00:48:12.693 --> 00:48:15.793]  Yeah, that's how they're getting is just through the water more than anything.
[00:48:15.953 --> 00:48:20.014]  And, I mean, a lot of well water is contaminated, even if you're on well water.
[00:48:20.594 --> 00:48:22.535]  It is so important to filter your water.
[00:48:22.575 --> 00:48:26.256]  And these little cheap charcoal things, all they do is take some of the bad taste out.
[00:48:26.656 --> 00:48:26.916]  Right.
[00:48:26.976 --> 00:48:31.257]  They don't touch the pathogenic bacteria, the cysts, the cellulose.
[00:48:31.738 --> 00:48:34.300]  The herbicides, the pesticides, the lead, the mercury, the arsenic.
[00:48:50.351 --> 00:48:50.852]  All of it.
[00:48:50.992 --> 00:48:54.855]  I mean, once you've been drinking really good filtered water, you try to drink tap water, it's a joke.
[00:48:55.395 --> 00:49:02.040]  Even in towns that are supposedly good like Austin, you go to Dallas or Houston or Chicago or New York, it tastes like gasoline.
[00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:03.541]  Houston's the worst.
[00:49:04.442 --> 00:49:06.143]  Folks, give Debbie a call.
[00:49:06.263 --> 00:49:09.986]  You can get a free catalog or you can find out about the specials they have.
[00:49:10.026 --> 00:49:15.050]  When you get a regular Berkey, you get one free gift, a portable sports bottle that just makes the water safe to drink.
[00:49:17.327 --> 00:49:18.547]  That's what I use when I go to the gym.
[00:49:18.607 --> 00:49:19.388]  My wife uses it.
[00:49:19.448 --> 00:49:20.328]  It's great on road trips.
[00:49:21.328 --> 00:49:27.871]  And if you get the Berkey with the built-in light system and other features, you get two free gifts.
[00:49:27.951 --> 00:49:28.851]  Give Debbie a call.
[00:49:28.871 --> 00:49:29.051]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:49:29.071 --> 00:49:29.111]  888-803-4438.
[00:49:37.797 --> 00:49:46.959]  Or go online to BerkeyWater.com and order via their safe, secure shopping cart and tell them what free gift you want in the email, little webmail comment section.
[00:49:46.979 --> 00:49:52.621]  You can also order the exact same systems and exact same specials via InfoWars.com and our secure shopping cart.
[00:49:52.641 --> 00:50:00.503]  We just fax sort of the orders each and every day as they come in and they ship them out to you UPS ground.
[00:50:01.243 --> 00:50:05.684]  And folks, it is so important, and this is an area you can take control of your life right now.
[00:50:06.942 --> 00:50:09.284]  And we use Berkey Water here in the office.
[00:50:09.304 --> 00:50:11.565]  I have a Berkey filter at home.
[00:50:12.045 --> 00:50:13.266]  My parents have a Berkey filter.
[00:50:13.746 --> 00:50:16.188]  I really believe in them and think it's a great system.
[00:50:16.528 --> 00:50:24.933]  So give Debbie a call, 1-888-803-4438 or BerkeyWater.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:50:25.293 --> 00:50:27.114]  And Debbie, I really appreciate you coming on.
[00:50:27.135 --> 00:50:28.035]  We'll talk to you soon.
[00:50:28.495 --> 00:50:29.276]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:50:29.336 --> 00:50:32.518]  We do have a new code that people can put on it.
[00:50:35.039 --> 00:50:36.040]  A new code they can put where?
[00:50:37.119 --> 00:50:37.559]  I'm sorry?
[00:50:38.259 --> 00:50:39.580]  A new code they can put where?
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:43.762]  They can put on their website so that they get the free gift instead of forgetting.
[00:50:44.342 --> 00:50:45.182]  Oh, it's a code.
[00:50:45.482 --> 00:50:47.243]  Yes, they can put in a code.
[00:50:47.583 --> 00:50:49.224]  So we'll talk about that next time.
[00:50:49.304 --> 00:50:50.004]  Well, no, no, no.
[00:50:50.144 --> 00:50:50.605]  Okay.
[00:50:50.725 --> 00:50:54.346]  I mean, stay there just for a minute on the other side and tell me about this code.
[00:50:54.386 --> 00:50:55.507]  I want people to find out about it.
[00:50:55.947 --> 00:50:56.507]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:07.862]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.203 --> 00:51:10.164]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:10.524 --> 00:51:18.190]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:25.915]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.315 --> 00:51:29.257]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq.
[00:51:29.638 --> 00:51:32.179]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:51:32.379 --> 00:51:33.200]  NSA spies.
[00:51:34.609 --> 00:51:37.730]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:41.530]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.011 --> 00:51:43.911]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.251 --> 00:51:48.172]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[00:51:48.712 --> 00:51:56.033]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:01.232 --> 00:52:06.513]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[00:52:06.733 --> 00:52:08.794]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[00:52:09.034 --> 00:52:16.155]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[00:52:16.295 --> 00:52:27.798]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[00:52:28.138 --> 00:52:28.939]  We're good to go.
[00:52:58.298 --> 00:53:07.207]  Hey ladies, if you love to shop, then visit HerbalHealer.com to browse through their online catalog.
[00:53:07.327 --> 00:53:12.772]  You'll find thousands of effective, alternative, and natural products for you and the whole family.
[00:53:12.932 --> 00:53:20.179]  Besides the amazing products you'll find, this shopping is guilt-free because you're investing in your health and your health is priceless.
[00:53:20.539 --> 00:53:21.700]  We're good to go.
[00:53:37.609 --> 00:53:38.170]  We're good to go.
[00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:39.151]  We're good to go.
[00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:08.381]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:54:08.841 --> 00:54:11.641]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:13.762 --> 00:54:23.784]  Yeah, I'm sure that when we put this Jesse Ventura video out, and when we put an article out, it'll get linked all over, it'll get millions of readers, and that's what drives stuff at the top.
[00:54:24.525 --> 00:54:29.726]  It won't be on Google Web probably for weeks, and it'll never be on Google News.
[00:54:31.331 --> 00:54:38.072]  But the way we get around Google is all these other Google News affiliates pick up our news, and then it gets in there that way.
[00:54:38.432 --> 00:54:40.193]  So we thank all those folks that do that.
[00:54:40.773 --> 00:54:44.893]  I mean, Google literally is our world today in news and information and data.
[00:54:47.074 --> 00:54:49.434]  And it's a big deal to be blocked by them, and I'm getting sick of it.
[00:54:49.774 --> 00:54:52.095]  We're going to go to Ed and Brian and a few others here in a minute.
[00:54:52.115 --> 00:54:52.955]  We've got a guest coming up.
[00:54:53.575 --> 00:54:55.175]  Debbie, how do we enter this code in?
[00:54:55.215 --> 00:54:56.335]  How do folks get the free gifts?
[00:54:57.055 --> 00:54:59.536]  They go to our website at berkeywater.com.
[00:55:00.595 --> 00:55:03.598]  When they get onto the shopping cart, there's a code now.
[00:55:04.138 --> 00:55:08.202]  And be sure to put in the comments that you're an Alex Jones listener.
[00:55:09.103 --> 00:55:19.373]  And then you can put in the code 1-F-R-E-E-G, which is one free G, and you get the free generic sport bottle with your order of $204 or more.
[00:55:19.393 --> 00:55:19.993]  Or you can put two free Gs.
[00:55:24.179 --> 00:55:26.740]  And that's for orders that are over $279.
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:30.801]  The $259, the big, super fancy Berkey with all the bells and whistles.
[00:55:30.981 --> 00:55:41.483]  And, again, these sports bottles do 600-plus refills of water and reduce the toxins but cut out all the bacteria and things that would make you sick.
[00:55:41.503 --> 00:55:42.424]  It's like a camp bottle.
[00:55:42.864 --> 00:55:44.964]  And then the gravity-fed filters cut out everything.
[00:55:45.384 --> 00:55:46.845]  Listen, Debbie, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:55:46.865 --> 00:55:47.405]  Thank you.
[00:55:47.425 --> 00:55:47.565]  Bye-bye.
[00:55:47.925 --> 00:55:48.265]  You bet.
[00:55:48.285 --> 00:55:49.266]  Take care.
[00:55:49.306 --> 00:55:51.227]  Give her a call, folks.
[00:55:51.247 --> 00:55:51.347]  888-803-4438.
[00:55:51.427 --> 00:55:53.588]  Ed in Utah, you're on the air.
[00:55:53.648 --> 00:55:54.008]  Welcome.
[00:55:54.709 --> 00:55:55.849]  Good to talk to you again, Alex.
[00:55:56.790 --> 00:56:01.392]  Listen, as you know, of course, Professor Jones is still on paid leave here.
[00:56:02.673 --> 00:56:04.214]  But people should know the timing of this.
[00:56:04.994 --> 00:56:11.277]  It was just days after both Bush and Chemical Rummy were in town, of course, pushing their crap here.
[00:56:11.978 --> 00:56:16.660]  And obviously they used some pull there with the Board of Regents to get the job done.
[00:56:17.256 --> 00:56:20.017]  You know, I like the reporting of Christopher Bolin.
[00:56:37.157 --> 00:56:45.160]  But when people run with folks that have savaged myself and my family, I never attack back.
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:56.745]  I just, like a gentleman, let people spit and stomp and defecate all over me, and I just, like a gentleman, and so I've been demonized even locally for being a gentleman, I just sit there and I just take it.
[00:56:58.366 --> 00:57:02.287]  But I respect you enough, Ed, and I want to create some controversy.
[00:57:02.327 --> 00:57:03.828]  This show's about news and information.
[00:57:04.857 --> 00:57:05.799]  We're good to go.
[00:57:05.819 --> 00:57:06.199]  We're good to go.
[00:57:17.321 --> 00:57:24.206]  Well, just to let you know, everybody there at the American Free Press that I've seen write about you and things that go on in your program has been positive.
[00:57:24.807 --> 00:57:27.068]  I love American... Listen, I love American Free Press.
[00:57:27.529 --> 00:57:28.349]  I know the editors.
[00:57:28.409 --> 00:57:29.410]  I know most of their writers.
[00:57:29.490 --> 00:57:30.331]  I love Jim Tucker.
[00:57:30.351 --> 00:57:31.692]  I'm not talking about American Free Press.
[00:57:32.132 --> 00:57:34.634]  I have nothing against Bo Lynn, either.
[00:57:35.234 --> 00:57:38.617]  I just... I mean, I don't want to get off into a bunch of stuff, man, but...
[00:57:39.707 --> 00:57:49.833]  I mean, my God, I've been savaged by some people with just made-up stuff, and people decided to lend credibility to it by running with them, so I can't run with people that run with those type of folks.
[00:57:49.894 --> 00:57:50.894]  Well, one last thing, Alex.
[00:57:50.934 --> 00:57:55.537]  When you have some important facts that I think what I'd like to hear vetted out on your show, like...
[00:57:55.936 --> 00:58:00.139]  The absolute control of John McCain by the Israeli lobby.
[00:58:00.159 --> 00:58:03.080]  Yeah, he is blackmailed by the Israelis and the Chinese.
[00:58:03.381 --> 00:58:03.841]  There you go.
[00:58:03.881 --> 00:58:10.445]  But John McCain's dad, Admiral McCain, covered up for what the Israelis did deliberately to the USS Liberty killing 34 of our guys.
[00:58:10.705 --> 00:58:10.905]  I know.
[00:58:10.925 --> 00:58:11.666]  My new film's about it.
[00:58:12.266 --> 00:58:13.447]  Well, there you go, Alex.
[00:58:13.507 --> 00:58:14.307]  Anyway, good job.
[00:58:14.387 --> 00:58:21.472]  And I'm hoping that, like I say, both entities, you and American Free Press, are vital to taking back our country.
[00:58:23.052 --> 00:58:23.733]  I think they are.
[00:58:24.752 --> 00:58:27.555]  It's just that, well, listen, I appreciate your call.
[00:58:28.435 --> 00:58:30.317]  You know, it's simple, folks.
[00:58:30.817 --> 00:58:35.081]  Yeah, we wrote an article about Bolin, and we posted it.
[00:58:35.581 --> 00:58:37.182]  We said it was horrible, and the cops beat him up.
[00:58:37.583 --> 00:58:38.223]  That's what we do.
[00:58:41.546 --> 00:58:45.429]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[00:58:45.769 --> 00:58:46.570]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.549 --> 00:58:58.190]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.850 --> 00:58:59.930]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:01.750]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.391 --> 00:59:03.191]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.951 --> 00:59:04.871]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.891 --> 00:59:09.212]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.692 --> 00:59:13.833]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.134 --> 00:59:17.114]  He'll be with us for the next 20 minutes.
[00:59:17.154 --> 00:59:19.895]  He joined us yesterday for close to an hour.
[00:59:20.715 --> 00:59:22.395]  We don't want to impose on his time.
[00:59:22.775 --> 00:59:24.996]  He just got off of his lunch hour.
[00:59:27.253 --> 00:59:31.897]  At the company he works at there in Ohio in network and computer security.
[00:59:32.717 --> 00:59:40.923]  We have confirmed that Laro Jones Chavez was honorably discharged from the Army as a sergeant.
[00:59:40.984 --> 00:59:43.606]  He did work at Central Command in Tampa.
[00:59:45.367 --> 00:59:47.849]  He did work in the secure areas.
[00:59:48.329 --> 00:59:49.830]  He was there on 9-11.
[00:59:51.211 --> 00:59:56.075]  And we're continuing to vet his story, but I wanted to give you an update and recap some of the things he did.
[00:59:56.849 --> 01:00:03.714]  Covered yesterday and let him cover up any other facets that weren't detailed here for you.
[01:00:04.035 --> 01:00:09.159]  And then Celica Stillo will be joining us in studio coming up in 20 minutes to cover a whole host of other issues.
[01:00:09.199 --> 01:00:11.701]  We will have open phones for those that are patiently holding.
[01:00:13.522 --> 01:00:17.685]  But I got this email about how he's getting a lot of flack from his bosses about the radio show.
[01:00:18.846 --> 01:00:23.390]  And they're getting lots of phone calls from angry New World Order types saying,
[01:00:24.031 --> 01:00:47.762]  You know, saying that you should get rid of this guy, why would you hire a crackpot, I'll never do business with you, on and on and on, trying to silence free speech, trying to grab for somebody because Laro, or LJ as he's known, wrote a letter to the Cincinnati Post just saying, here's my name, here's my number, here's what I do, here's where I work, this is what I did on 9-11.
[01:00:49.125 --> 01:00:53.646]  And it got out on the web, and we interviewed him, and now this is how the neocons operate.
[01:00:54.046 --> 01:00:58.427]  So we really appreciate your courage, LJ, and we appreciate you coming on with us.
[01:00:59.267 --> 01:00:59.447]  Oh, sure.
[01:00:59.487 --> 01:01:00.327]  It's my pleasure, Alex.
[01:01:00.367 --> 01:01:01.227]  Thank you for having me again.
[01:01:01.807 --> 01:01:03.127]  Hey, are you excited?
[01:01:03.688 --> 01:01:08.248]  I guess I didn't tell you off-air earlier, I interviewed Jesse Ventura about 9-11 last night.
[01:01:09.068 --> 01:01:09.589]  Oh, I heard.
[01:01:10.109 --> 01:01:14.149]  My close friend came over and saw me and was like, guess what?
[01:01:14.509 --> 01:01:16.090]  Jesse Ventura spoke out last night.
[01:01:16.110 --> 01:01:16.850]  I was like, sweet!
[01:01:18.012 --> 01:01:19.673]  Yeah, it's exciting.
[01:01:20.034 --> 01:01:25.818]  I mean, he just said, I question the official story, and he brought up Northwoods, Tonkin, and the NORAD stand-down.
[01:01:26.599 --> 01:01:31.203]  But we'll be putting that on the web tonight, and we'll play it tomorrow here on air, some of that interview.
[01:01:32.224 --> 01:01:34.486]  But what are the neocons doing?
[01:01:34.506 --> 01:01:36.667]  I guess they're trying to do what they did to Professor Jones, do you?
[01:01:37.328 --> 01:01:37.828]  I guess.
[01:01:37.848 --> 01:01:42.312]  I mean, you know, it's funny because the first time I did this, I feared for, you know, I thought, well,
[01:01:42.884 --> 01:01:48.406]  The government's going to come shoot me in my sleep, and, you know, I don't really fear death because there are things much worse than death.
[01:01:48.446 --> 01:01:51.748]  Like, now I'm having to defend my character and, you know, my job.
[01:01:53.088 --> 01:01:57.550]  But, you know, I got asked yesterday, you know, what's going on.
[01:01:57.570 --> 01:01:59.771]  We're getting, like, lots of calls, lots of email.
[01:01:59.811 --> 01:02:07.495]  I mean, because, you know, my company's address was on there, I guess, and now we're starting to get, like, proliferated with spam and just, you know, lots of things.
[01:02:07.515 --> 01:02:10.716]  And people calling in, you know, calling me an idiot and a crackpot and whatever.
[01:02:11.226 --> 01:02:21.513]  You know, like you said, telling, you know, asking the company why they didn't even hire somebody like me, you know, and, you know, people, you know, doing just like, you know, 911 bloggers, it's just, it's ridiculous.
[01:02:21.533 --> 01:02:22.134]  I mean, it really is.
[01:02:22.154 --> 01:02:27.377]  I mean, you know, they, I understand that people want to question things, but they're like, you know, we research Dominion, there's no ex-military there.
[01:02:27.898 --> 01:02:29.199]  Well, that's completely untrue.
[01:02:29.219 --> 01:02:30.340]  I mean, you know, you have my DD-214.
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:33.722]  I mean, that's like privacy information that I gave you just so I can
[01:02:34.595 --> 01:02:36.697]  Prove who I am.
[01:02:36.757 --> 01:02:41.360]  I'm getting emails like, he said military time and then added AM to it.
[01:02:41.701 --> 01:02:43.102]  Pure proof it's not true.
[01:02:43.522 --> 01:02:44.383]  We did the research.
[01:02:44.403 --> 01:02:45.363]  You were in the military.
[01:02:45.383 --> 01:02:46.784]  You were honorably discharged.
[01:02:47.165 --> 01:02:48.446]  You are who you say you are.
[01:02:48.466 --> 01:02:49.727]  There's photos of you on the web.
[01:02:50.487 --> 01:02:53.149]  I don't know what people want.
[01:02:54.310 --> 01:02:55.531]  We're going to continue to vet.
[01:02:56.191 --> 01:02:58.233]  We wrote a story yesterday before I'd even looked.
[01:02:58.593 --> 01:03:02.016]  Paul had already written a story questioning, but he was just covering others' questioning.
[01:03:02.496 --> 01:03:03.597]  And said, we're going to do research.
[01:03:03.617 --> 01:03:04.637]  Well, we did do research.
[01:03:04.657 --> 01:03:06.978]  But what about Norman Mineta?
[01:03:07.018 --> 01:03:08.879]  What about all the other witnesses of the stand-down?
[01:03:09.199 --> 01:03:24.006]  No, no, this is powerful info, and I don't blame people wanting to vet it, but then when they start doing mental somersaults and all these weird gyrations to try to disprove what happened, it's pretty serious.
[01:03:24.747 --> 01:03:26.067]  I mean, you put yourself out there.
[01:03:26.087 --> 01:03:31.370]  You put who you are, where you work, what you do out there, and you're under a lot of pressure over this, and we need to stand with you.
[01:03:32.148 --> 01:03:33.869]  Stay there, LJ.
[01:03:33.889 --> 01:03:36.531]  We're going to be right back after this quick break and do one more segment, okay?
[01:03:37.051 --> 01:03:37.352]  Okay.
[01:03:37.872 --> 01:03:38.713]  You got time to do that?
[01:03:39.333 --> 01:03:40.053]  Absolutely, sir.
[01:03:40.314 --> 01:03:41.214]  Okay, fantastic.
[01:03:41.274 --> 01:03:43.015]  We appreciate you coming on with us.
[01:03:43.576 --> 01:03:46.118]  We're getting a report out on his interview with us yesterday.
[01:03:46.158 --> 01:03:49.160]  That'll be out sometime this afternoon as well.
[01:03:56.335 --> 01:03:59.516]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:03:59.856 --> 01:04:01.796]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:02.156 --> 01:04:09.818]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.498 --> 01:04:17.539]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:20.900]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:23.581]  The White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:04:24.021 --> 01:04:24.741]  NSA spy.
[01:04:25.327 --> 01:04:29.390]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:33.153]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.653 --> 01:04:35.594]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.894 --> 01:04:39.817]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:54.657 --> 01:05:05.986]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[01:05:06.206 --> 01:05:09.729]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[01:05:09.989 --> 01:05:14.231]  Sists, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:05:14.532 --> 01:05:18.474]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[01:05:18.694 --> 01:05:25.258]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:05:25.518 --> 01:05:31.001]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[01:05:31.241 --> 01:05:38.224]  The Berkey light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[01:05:38.304 --> 01:05:40.064]  The Berkey light purifier for only $279.
[01:05:40.144 --> 01:05:40.765]  Call new Millennium 888-803-4438.
[01:05:40.805 --> 01:05:41.125]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:05:41.205 --> 01:05:42.545]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:05:42.565 --> 01:05:43.726]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:55.781]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:05:55.902 --> 01:05:58.263]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[01:05:58.323 --> 01:06:04.527]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[01:06:05.987 --> 01:06:08.289]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:06:08.949 --> 01:06:12.491]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:06:13.031 --> 01:06:17.174]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:06:17.754 --> 01:06:20.696]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:06:21.696 --> 01:06:24.617]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:06:25.357 --> 01:06:31.338]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:06:31.438 --> 01:06:34.419]  That's 1-888-892-6238.
[01:06:34.659 --> 01:06:39.260]  For the following two free reports, U.S.
[01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:42.241]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[01:06:43.201 --> 01:06:45.502]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[01:06:45.562 --> 01:06:49.763]  That's 888-8XANADU.
[01:06:50.083 --> 01:06:51.043]  And ask for George.
[01:06:53.478 --> 01:06:55.679]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:56.239 --> 01:06:59.139]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:16.664]  Later in this hour, I will succinctly recap my interview last night with Jesse Ventura, the former governor of Minnesota, the former highly decorated Navy SEAL, the Hollywood actor, the ridiculous wrestler.
[01:07:18.164 --> 01:07:20.665]  He gave us an interview.
[01:07:20.685 --> 01:07:21.805]  It was supposed to be a ten-minute interview.
[01:07:21.845 --> 01:07:22.525]  He sat for about
[01:07:23.129 --> 01:07:26.430]  I'd say about 20 minutes, about 5 minutes, getting him shut up and ready.
[01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:36.693]  And he was ready to keep going, but Kinky Friedman's handler, not really his handler, Juford's a nice guy, but he was being a handler, was like, it's over, nope, you're done, you're done, we've got to go.
[01:07:36.713 --> 01:07:40.174]  And Kinky's like, you can come to the hotel and keep doing the interview.
[01:07:41.034 --> 01:07:42.715]  Juford's like, no, no!
[01:07:42.795 --> 01:07:44.455]  And I was like, no, I've got enough.
[01:07:44.555 --> 01:07:50.857]  And then we kind of had this argument out in the parking lot at the back of the restaurant, myself and...
[01:07:51.923 --> 01:07:52.623]  Jesse Ventura.
[01:07:52.863 --> 01:07:54.064]  Yes, I'm arguing with him.
[01:07:54.084 --> 01:08:00.967]  This huge 6'6", looks like a cave viking, looming over me as we argue about another issue.
[01:08:02.068 --> 01:08:09.731]  And then he had said earlier that they wanted a copy of Terror Storm, and so I gave him a couple, and we've got him as soon as he gets in the Cadillac.
[01:08:09.751 --> 01:08:14.813]  He's just sitting there on video just reading it and looking at it all like he's just a kid with a new toy.
[01:08:15.854 --> 01:08:17.194]  I'll tell you more about all of it later.
[01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:20.316]  Right now, we've got...
[01:08:21.698 --> 01:08:23.740]  Laro Jones Chavez.
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:26.242]  This goes by LJ when he was in the military.
[01:08:27.123 --> 01:08:29.826]  And we've got his DD-214.
[01:08:29.866 --> 01:08:30.807]  We've got it all up there.
[01:08:32.688 --> 01:08:36.292]  Again, there's three issues now, and I'd like you to speak on any of them.
[01:08:36.792 --> 01:08:46.281]  Other facets of things you witnessed when you were in Central Command in the top secret area on the morning of 9-11, the day of 9-11.
[01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:48.430]  We're good to go.
[01:09:11.021 --> 01:09:14.923]  And I showed the folks who were in the military, been in the military here, and they said it looks like a real DD-214.
[01:09:15.043 --> 01:09:20.226]  We went and looked you up and found you in the military rolls, found photos of you in your uniform.
[01:09:21.366 --> 01:09:23.528]  So why do you think people are in such denial?
[01:09:24.868 --> 01:09:35.073]  And then see what type of attacks you're going through now at your office that you, in your letter to the editor, you put your phone number in there and where you worked.
[01:09:35.574 --> 01:09:36.254]  So they're calling.
[01:09:36.274 --> 01:09:38.375]  So go through those three points for us, sir, please.
[01:09:39.048 --> 01:09:42.370]  Okay, we'll start with A, obviously.
[01:09:42.390 --> 01:10:00.458]  During my time at Central Command, I worked in the SCIF, and during the morning of 9-11, I read a document, a top-secret document that was on a PSYOP desk that was open to one of the pages, page four, some one of those, and it gave scenarios of hijacked planes crashing into buildings.
[01:10:01.198 --> 01:10:17.466]  Now, a lot of people, you know, and we were in support of Vigilant Guardian, and, you know, I got a call from Neela earlier, and he was like, you know, somebody was just claiming that they were at Center Command during that time, saying that, you know, Center Command only participated in, you know, areas in the Middle East, you know, for exercise.
[01:10:17.506 --> 01:10:18.346]  Well, that's not true.
[01:10:18.386 --> 01:10:29.191]  I mean, I've been covering CENTCOM for years, and CENTCOM is involved in all sorts of communications with NORAD and NORTHCOM and all the rest of the comms.
[01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:30.260]  Right.
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:31.221]  North Com, South Com.
[01:10:31.281 --> 01:10:41.071]  I mean, and the thing is, is that, yes, you know, the main job of Central Command is to perform exercises and perform guidance and watch over the Middle East, but it doesn't mean... And you said that yesterday.
[01:10:41.151 --> 01:10:42.192]  You said that yesterday.
[01:10:42.792 --> 01:10:42.953]  Yeah.
[01:10:43.073 --> 01:10:47.337]  Operation Bright Star, which was an exercise in Egypt, is what we were participating in.
[01:10:47.517 --> 01:10:52.142]  Shit, Com has been doing drills and urban warfare takeover drills for years.
[01:10:52.222 --> 01:10:53.443]  I've been covering it forever.
[01:10:54.674 --> 01:10:55.535]  They do do a lot.
[01:10:55.575 --> 01:11:01.040]  I mean, like I say, SOCOM is located right there on McDill, you know, and they do lots of, you know, urban warfare training.
[01:11:02.181 --> 01:11:08.726]  But, you know, so I had witness to that document, and, you know, like I said in another interview, if I had just, if I would have fought at the time.
[01:11:08.846 --> 01:11:15.452]  I've had CENTCOM deployed troops in Brooksville, Florida, chasing me in dune buggies through swamps.
[01:11:16.033 --> 01:11:17.374]  Okay, I don't want to hear it.
[01:11:17.882 --> 01:11:23.707]  Yeah, they do have, like, a joint support communications element that's also on the base, and they do, like, lots of cool stuff.
[01:11:23.727 --> 01:11:29.971]  And they chased me around with the police all night long for two days and told neighbors not to talk to us.
[01:11:30.211 --> 01:11:31.272]  It's all in the takeover.
[01:11:31.292 --> 01:11:35.135]  Okay, so we've established CENTCOM is involved in operations here.
[01:11:35.175 --> 01:11:35.455]  Go ahead.
[01:11:35.976 --> 01:11:44.542]  Right, and then, of course, you know, the big thing is, you know, the individuals I was with was given a verbal confirmation, you know, from this Air Force officer that...
[01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:48.737]  NORAD was told to stand down.
[01:11:48.757 --> 01:11:50.979]  We have a stand down order to scramble planes.
[01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:53.522]  People are like, we need the name of that guy.
[01:11:53.602 --> 01:11:56.264]  It's been five years, and I'm the worst person with names.
[01:11:56.284 --> 01:11:56.684]  St.
[01:11:57.305 --> 01:11:58.446]  Thomas is a big place.
[01:11:58.486 --> 01:12:00.948]  You're in a pit that's got 80 to 100 people.
[01:12:01.288 --> 01:12:04.011]  There's 500 in the whole building, probably.
[01:12:04.031 --> 01:12:05.432]  There's 3,000 in the whole building.
[01:12:05.732 --> 01:12:10.436]  Okay, so you said there in that particular classified area, you said 80 to 100, I believe, yesterday.
[01:12:10.737 --> 01:12:12.258]  How many in the whole building?
[01:12:13.019 --> 01:12:14.100]  Between $25,000 and $3,000.
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:15.401]  That was at the time.
[01:12:15.461 --> 01:12:17.082]  Now they could have scaled down some.
[01:12:18.583 --> 01:12:22.106]  Obviously, you won't give us the names of some of the officers you know because you don't want to get them in trouble.
[01:12:22.126 --> 01:12:23.387]  You don't want to speak for them.
[01:12:23.407 --> 01:12:32.873]  But you remember this other high-level, what you said, a general with these colonels going and talking to him and repeat what you said yesterday.
[01:12:33.874 --> 01:12:37.557]  People started questioning, where's the air defense support?
[01:12:37.597 --> 01:12:37.757]  This
[01:12:43.027 --> 01:12:53.643]  Air Force commander comes out, and then my lieutenant general buddy, and about two or three colonels, some majors, high-ranking officials, we all go over, and he's standing there, and they're like, why haven't pennies been scrambled?
[01:12:53.663 --> 01:12:56.387]  And he's like, NORAD received a stand-down order.
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:59.323]  You know, there's an order to stand down from scrambling of jets right now.
[01:12:59.343 --> 01:13:04.829]  Yeah, the point is, for those that are saying CENTCOM doesn't run operations or doesn't do drills domestically, number one, they do.
[01:13:04.849 --> 01:13:07.572]  You can pull up all the articles on their own website about it.
[01:13:08.012 --> 01:13:18.583]  But number two, all of these comms interface with each other and have liaison officers in interlocking rings, you know, across from Space Command to CENTCOM to NASA.
[01:13:18.603 --> 01:13:18.904]  That's right.
[01:13:19.904 --> 01:13:26.530]  To NORAD, to FEMA, they're all communicating, and so everybody's scrambling there saying, why hasn't something been done?
[01:13:26.770 --> 01:13:30.474]  And you see the Air Force liaison officer being spoken to.
[01:13:30.494 --> 01:13:31.695]  That's correct.
[01:13:31.815 --> 01:13:36.559]  And, you know, a lot of people are like, well, how is this sergeant, you know, just standing there talking to, you know, I, that's what I did.
[01:13:36.579 --> 01:13:42.805]  I mean, you know, these people that I repair the computers, I mean, you know, they were, everybody at Fincom is like a major or higher.
[01:13:42.845 --> 01:13:44.166]  Like, we don't have a lot of privates.
[01:13:44.246 --> 01:13:46.028]  Like, we don't have... You're in a nest.
[01:13:46.733 --> 01:13:47.494]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:13:47.514 --> 01:13:49.295]  You know, like, this is a command center.
[01:13:49.335 --> 01:13:52.977]  This isn't a place where, like, the highest-ranking, you know, officer is a colonel.
[01:13:53.057 --> 01:14:00.322]  I mean, you know, we had this little, you know, group, you know, that we were like, well, if he's not a colonel, we're not even going to help him out, you know, because we would pick and choose who we liked to help, you know, at the help desk.
[01:14:00.342 --> 01:14:02.084]  You've got to be friends with the IT guys.
[01:14:02.104 --> 01:14:04.025]  You know, these colonels would, like, let me come and talk to them.
[01:14:04.045 --> 01:14:05.446]  I met lots of war heroes, you know.
[01:14:05.466 --> 01:14:11.450]  I mean, like, you know, the gentleman who was in Somalia, you know, General Harrell,
[01:14:12.123 --> 01:14:12.883]  I've shaken his hand.
[01:14:12.963 --> 01:14:13.744]  Oh, monster grip.
[01:14:13.764 --> 01:14:16.585]  I mean, but, you know, these things are, like, people, like, just tearing me apart.
[01:14:16.625 --> 01:14:24.347]  Like, you know, and then, you know, the thing is, in the letter, I put the, you know, the skip, which was basically a command, you know, an underground bunker.
[01:14:24.487 --> 01:14:27.368]  It's, you know, to, like, set the story straight, it's not underground.
[01:14:27.388 --> 01:14:29.749]  It's like a 45-degree angle ramp that goes down, but...
[01:14:30.662 --> 01:14:32.363]  A bunker is a bunker.
[01:14:32.403 --> 01:14:34.204]  It's like people try to spin that.
[01:14:34.244 --> 01:14:35.185]  It's all semantic.
[01:14:35.305 --> 01:14:35.945]  It is.
[01:14:35.965 --> 01:14:38.927]  The government called it... Hold on, let me finish.
[01:14:39.207 --> 01:14:48.213]  The government called the facility in Building 7 that was on the 30-something floor, they called it Giuliani's Bunker.
[01:14:48.653 --> 01:14:49.614]  Command Bunker, exactly.
[01:14:49.654 --> 01:14:51.475]  They're called bunkers because they're fortified.
[01:14:51.515 --> 01:14:51.835]  Go ahead.
[01:14:52.335 --> 01:14:56.118]  Right, and this was the center fortified facility, and it was always dark in there.
[01:14:56.138 --> 01:14:59.500]  They always had big screens up with different things going on.
[01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:02.361]  You know, but everybody was like, you know, asking that.
[01:15:02.381 --> 01:15:04.262]  And then, you know, I've got, you know, questions on my DD-214.
[01:15:04.282 --> 01:15:07.203]  People are saying, well, why, how come Block 22 is not signed?
[01:15:07.924 --> 01:15:15.307]  I don't know, but when I Google, if you do a Google image search for DD-214, you'll find, like, there's 20 different versions of the 214.
[01:15:15.927 --> 01:15:22.331]  Like, I don't know why mine looks different than any of those, but that's the official one that I've got, you know, from the military personnel.
[01:15:23.031 --> 01:15:26.993]  And, you know, a lot of people have been questioning, like, if you're an Afghanistan, you don't have an Afghan service ribbon.
[01:15:27.868 --> 01:15:29.089]  I don't have an Afghan service ribbon.
[01:15:29.109 --> 01:15:30.490]  I don't have a combat action badge.
[01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:36.115]  I'm entitled to those things, but those are just awards that I don't feel are necessary.
[01:15:36.375 --> 01:15:41.479]  The reason I don't have those is because to get an award, your commander has to put you in for it, stating why.
[01:15:41.499 --> 01:15:43.421]  You go through all this whole process.
[01:15:43.481 --> 01:15:45.162]  It sometimes takes three or four to six months.
[01:15:45.702 --> 01:15:49.966]  When I came back from Afghanistan, I did a Chapter 13, which is an early drop for college.
[01:15:50.106 --> 01:15:51.367]  The regulation states that
[01:15:52.154 --> 01:15:58.796]  If, you know, you have a letter from an accredited university that will let you out up to six months prior than your ETS day, which is your end of term of service.
[01:15:59.396 --> 01:16:01.096]  So I didn't want to wait six months to get out.
[01:16:01.276 --> 01:16:02.477]  Like, I wanted to just get out.
[01:16:02.557 --> 01:16:03.437]  So I got accepted.
[01:16:03.637 --> 01:16:04.617]  Let me ask a question.
[01:16:04.637 --> 01:16:05.837]  You know, we've made calls.
[01:16:05.897 --> 01:16:07.298]  We've been told you were in the military.
[01:16:07.358 --> 01:16:10.018]  We've found other references to you on the web, on government websites.
[01:16:10.339 --> 01:16:11.439]  We've seen pictures of you.
[01:16:12.119 --> 01:16:17.820]  Why don't these people that just keep trying to make stuff up about you, why don't they just go actually do research themselves?
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:20.241]  Instead, they just sit there and say it isn't true.
[01:16:21.134 --> 01:16:21.815]  I know.
[01:16:21.895 --> 01:16:24.496]  At this point, there's a lot of misinformation going around.
[01:16:24.636 --> 01:16:30.299]  I understand why they're questioning me, but I'm like, wow, my character's at stake here.
[01:16:30.319 --> 01:16:39.044]  And then, of course, with the calls coming back and forth with the building and stuff, my boss and the owner of my company obviously is not happy because he's like, what's going on here?
[01:16:39.124 --> 01:16:41.986]  But I did this because I told my boss yesterday, what wouldn't
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:48.441]  Well, let's do a plug for the company.
[01:16:48.461 --> 01:16:49.481]  What is the company you work for, dude?
[01:16:59.427 --> 01:17:05.970]  Um, they are a, uh, they develop, and I really probably shouldn't talk about this, Alex, I mean, seriously, I don't want to.
[01:17:06.010 --> 01:17:07.251]  Oh, let's just not worry about it then.
[01:17:07.371 --> 01:17:13.674]  I don't want to get any more, like, stuff going on, but, you know, they're a software engineering company, and they're good people, I mean, you know, it's a good company.
[01:17:14.034 --> 01:17:21.777]  Now, obviously, if it was some internet service provider or something, we could just plug it and get them some business instead of, instead of neocons calling up drooling, saying, uh.
[01:17:22.498 --> 01:17:25.199]  Yeah, that's what it's turned into, you know, and, uh.
[01:17:25.919 --> 01:17:35.442]  You know, and I understand people are going to question this because there has been a lot of misinformation, and, you know, I just want to, you know, I can't, like, the thing is, I can't, I don't have documents.
[01:17:35.482 --> 01:17:37.022]  Like, I don't have that document to show that.
[01:17:37.102 --> 01:17:37.682]  I saw it.
[01:17:37.702 --> 01:17:42.604]  You know, I don't have a recording of that Air Force liaison saying that NORAD came down.
[01:17:42.684 --> 01:17:43.624]  I heard it with my ears.
[01:17:43.844 --> 01:17:52.246]  But you did see the document about how CENTCOM was running a drill, and we know that CENTCOM was involved in the drills.
[01:17:52.286 --> 01:17:53.887]  That later came out in USA Today.
[01:17:54.654 --> 01:17:54.854]  Right.
[01:17:54.914 --> 01:17:55.794]  Oh, and I absolutely know.
[01:17:55.935 --> 01:18:02.837]  And one more thing I'll put to rest is the fact that people are questioning, like, well, how did you know a few months prior to 9-11 that Chinning was put in charge of NORAD?
[01:18:02.877 --> 01:18:06.438]  I'm like, well, and the answer to that is in the military we have a chain of command.
[01:18:06.839 --> 01:18:09.219]  And every soldier is entitled to know this chain of command.
[01:18:09.239 --> 01:18:14.141]  That's from your immediate reporting NCO all the way up to the commander-in-chief, to the President of the United States.
[01:18:14.161 --> 01:18:18.463]  And any time any one of those legislatures or titles changes or a new person comes in,
[01:18:19.082 --> 01:18:24.546]  They update that chain of command and they send it out via email or via hard copy to all the soldiers because we're supposed to know that.
[01:18:25.367 --> 01:18:27.789]  And that's why we knew that Cheney was put in charge.
[01:18:28.930 --> 01:18:32.072]  Well, it was a big deal in the military when that happened.
[01:18:33.173 --> 01:18:35.535]  It was a loss of confidence.
[01:18:35.575 --> 01:18:38.698]  It was like when they took the launch codes off the submarines.
[01:18:39.318 --> 01:18:40.659]  Saying, we don't trust you.
[01:18:40.679 --> 01:18:43.422]  It's like putting Bill Gates in charge of NORAD.
[01:18:43.442 --> 01:18:45.663]  It doesn't make any sense.
[01:18:45.964 --> 01:18:47.445]  Hey, listen, we stand with you.
[01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:49.362]  LJ, God bless you.
[01:18:50.083 --> 01:18:50.885]  God bless you, Alex.
[01:18:50.925 --> 01:18:52.067]  Thank you very much for what you're doing.
[01:18:52.267 --> 01:18:52.568]  You bet.
[01:18:53.396 --> 01:18:58.679]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[01:18:58.899 --> 01:19:00.980]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:08.324]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:19:08.464 --> 01:19:19.971]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[01:19:20.311 --> 01:19:21.112]  We're good to go.
[01:19:52.232 --> 01:19:56.013]  Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:19:56.493 --> 01:19:58.814]  Today is September 26, 2006.
[01:19:59.694 --> 01:20:00.474]  Gold opened at $586.70.
[01:20:00.714 --> 01:20:05.916]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for $618.72.
[01:20:06.496 --> 01:20:10.277]  Again, that's $618.72 to purchase one ounce gold coins.
[01:20:11.178 --> 01:20:18.460]  With a slow economy, real estate prices dropping, war on terrorism, the economical climate in the United States is questionable.
[01:20:19.435 --> 01:20:19.696]  U.S.
[01:20:19.716 --> 01:20:22.839]  citizens work a third of their life just to cover tax liabilities.
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:26.284]  Bankruptcies continue to weaken our financial institutions.
[01:20:27.173 --> 01:20:30.916]  Midas is offering the 2007 Red Book, a guide for U.S.
[01:20:30.956 --> 01:20:32.097]  gold and silver coins.
[01:20:32.638 --> 01:20:38.803]  Many of you are considering getting involved, but before you purchase precious metals, pick up a copy for reference at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:38.823 --> 01:20:40.825]  Or to evaluate the position you have already accumulated, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:40.885 --> 01:20:41.205]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:54.682 --> 01:20:57.263]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:57.843 --> 01:21:02.924]  Did you know that the United Nations has never settled disputes, but always makes them worse?
[01:21:03.764 --> 01:21:07.665]  Our own ambassador to the United Nations in 1982 admitted such.
[01:21:08.326 --> 01:21:16.668]  Did you know that the United Nations ignores communist atrocities, but always targets non-communist nations and their leaders for overthrow?
[01:21:17.728 --> 01:21:28.176]  We would like to help you understand why these things are happening and how they fulfill Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to News Watch Magazine.

[01:21:55.058 --> 01:21:56.759]  Hello, this is Amy Bjorklund.
[01:21:56.939 --> 01:21:59.539]  Are you totally satisfied with the nourishment you're getting?
[01:21:59.639 --> 01:22:02.660]  Do you have enough energy to do everything you really want to do?
[01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:06.381]  And are you content to remain in your current state of health indefinitely?
[01:22:06.641 --> 01:22:12.462]  Have you already tried diets, exercise, vitamins, juicing, or the latest, greatest nutritional wonder products?
[01:22:12.822 --> 01:22:17.603]  Perhaps those things have grown tiresome and not made you feel and look as well as you'd really like to.
[01:22:17.843 --> 01:22:28.266]  But what if you found from a single source the world's freshest, purest, most complete, whole, live food nourishment that tastes delicious and couldn't be any easier to consume?
[01:22:28.526 --> 01:22:29.807]  Well, you just did.
[01:22:30.167 --> 01:22:31.127]  So don't hesitate.
[01:22:31.247 --> 01:22:35.288]  Take the living energy you've always wanted from your nutrition right now.
[01:22:35.568 --> 01:22:41.030]  Visit truthinexcellence.com, click the Truth in Excellence banner on GCNlive.com,
[01:22:41.830 --> 01:22:43.591]  All our times have come
[01:23:14.332 --> 01:23:22.915]  And make no mistake, we will be like they are one day.
[01:23:22.975 --> 01:23:26.337]  That goes for Negroponte, Adolf Hitler, Bill Clinton, you name it.
[01:23:26.417 --> 01:23:29.298]  All of these New World Order criminals.
[01:23:42.049 --> 01:23:48.552]  These people that feed on our population, people that accept evil, people that rationalize it, they will pay for what they've done.
[01:23:48.973 --> 01:24:06.802]  Sutter Castillo is an Army sniper, veteran of Vietnam, and became a police officer, then a DEA agent, head DEA agent for Latin American operations, personally witnessed government drug dealing, and decided in his surveillance capacity to surveil it for several years and compile thousands of photos and documents and documents
[01:24:07.509 --> 01:24:08.730]  He's put a lot of that on his website.
[01:24:08.750 --> 01:24:11.232]  We have links to it up on Infowars.com.
[01:24:11.292 --> 01:24:14.915]  And it's always great to have Sully Castillo in studio with us.
[01:24:14.955 --> 01:24:15.816]  Sully, thank you, sir.
[01:24:15.976 --> 01:24:16.296]  Yes, sir.
[01:24:16.336 --> 01:24:16.997]  Thank you for having me.
[01:24:17.017 --> 01:24:18.058]  It's always good to have you, my friend.
[01:24:19.099 --> 01:24:24.763]  Before we forget, just out of the gates, a group of young men who are just doing a great job here locally.
[01:24:26.785 --> 01:24:27.566]  They're at UT.
[01:24:27.626 --> 01:24:32.990]  They are having you down to speak tonight at the Texas Union Ballroom.
[01:24:33.030 --> 01:24:34.591]  And I think that thing holds like 700 people.
[01:24:36.032 --> 01:24:40.191]  And so tell us about that event that's coming up tonight here in Austin, Texas.
[01:24:40.828 --> 01:24:48.472]  Well, basically, it's going to be a lecture on our atrocities our government committed, specifically in Latin America.
[01:24:49.053 --> 01:24:50.333]  We're going to be talking about Nigro Ponte.
[01:24:50.353 --> 01:25:09.644]  We're going to be talking about the death squads, Colonel James Steele, who's now in Iraq with the commando units, and other atrocities that the Reagan-Bush administration has committed back in the early 80s, and also talk about the same people that were there at that time period are now at the White House working for this administration.
[01:25:10.217 --> 01:25:11.138]  Now, what's the schedule?
[01:25:11.158 --> 01:25:15.961]  You're going to be speaking at the Texas Union tonight.
[01:25:15.981 --> 01:25:19.784]  That's the 26th of September at 7 p.m.
[01:25:19.844 --> 01:25:22.565]  at the Texas Union Ballroom at UT.
[01:25:22.786 --> 01:25:25.567]  It's put on by the Project for a New American Citizen.
[01:25:26.308 --> 01:25:31.331]  These two young men that are really having 9-11 demonstrations, anti-war demonstrations.
[01:25:31.371 --> 01:25:34.133]  They're really off and running, doing a great job.
[01:25:34.193 --> 01:25:37.235]  How is Brave New Books there across the street from the campus?
[01:25:37.255 --> 01:25:38.196]  How are they tied into this?
[01:25:38.456 --> 01:25:45.421]  Well, basically they're coordinating to put this event together, and basically they're doing a great job.
[01:25:45.481 --> 01:25:48.884]  They're letting the community know, the students know, advertising.
[01:25:49.805 --> 01:25:56.830]  They're marketing this event because, you know, it's funny, but these kids are putting this event together.
[01:25:56.870 --> 01:26:07.698]  They were born around that time period, 84, 85, and, you know, they were just babies, and now they're going to know the truth, what happened from those days that they were born.
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.663]  Are you going to do that incredible slideshow presentation?
[01:26:11.024 --> 01:26:11.765]  I'm going to do that.
[01:26:12.005 --> 01:26:14.448]  I have a slideshow presentation that I'll put out.
[01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:16.291]  It's got the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[01:26:16.411 --> 01:26:20.116]  It's got people before they were murdered and after they were murdered.
[01:26:20.336 --> 01:26:23.881]  And we've got pictures of CIA officials that...
[01:26:25.102 --> 01:26:28.123]  Participated in a lot of the tortures in Central America.
[01:26:28.263 --> 01:26:29.983]  And photos of some of the dead people they killed.
[01:26:30.243 --> 01:26:30.663]  Exactly.
[01:26:30.763 --> 01:26:31.263]  Absolutely.
[01:26:31.343 --> 01:26:39.645]  And ironically enough, I get emails from the families of the people that were murdered asking me if their father had died peacefully.
[01:26:39.785 --> 01:26:40.865]  They've never seen this stuff.
[01:26:40.905 --> 01:26:41.865]  They've never seen this stuff.
[01:26:41.945 --> 01:26:44.126]  So basically, you know, I've had it.
[01:26:44.286 --> 01:26:51.407]  And one of the big things that really helped my cause here in the lectures is the fact that I kept journals.
[01:26:52.442 --> 01:26:55.864]  I've been thinking, I've got to start keeping a journal because stuff gets foggy over time.
[01:26:55.904 --> 01:26:57.825]  It's so important to keep those journals.
[01:26:57.845 --> 01:27:02.026]  Exactly, especially if you want to write a nice book one day and you'll be able to go back and just do that.
[01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:20.633]  Sella Castillo, people have trouble believing that there are cold-blooded people in the world, period, much less in government.
[01:27:20.673 --> 01:27:25.215]  But when we get back, I want to talk about what Negroponte did, the type of things you witnessed, what the death squads did.
[01:27:25.295 --> 01:27:30.098]  And you reported here about seven months before it came out in mainstream papers in the U.S.
[01:27:31.696 --> 01:27:32.457]  We're good to go.
[01:27:48.995 --> 01:27:52.397]  I want to talk about John Yoo and Gonzalez and the memos they've written for Bush.
[01:27:52.777 --> 01:27:55.819]  And, of course, it's about to pass the Senate this week.
[01:27:56.419 --> 01:28:00.581]  A secret arrest of any American citizen, secret rendition, torture.
[01:28:01.181 --> 01:28:08.925]  They're actually codifying it in law and then calling it a defeat of Bush when the lawyers have actually looked at it and say, no, this is worse than what Bush even asked for.
[01:28:09.546 --> 01:28:11.727]  So, I mean, they're actually bringing this to America.
[01:28:11.747 --> 01:28:17.730]  And about two years ago on this show, you said you watch what they're doing in Latin America, they're going to do in Iraq, and then they're going to do it here.
[01:28:18.516 --> 01:28:19.897]  And I don't like you being right, Sully.
[01:28:19.917 --> 01:28:21.218]  I'm getting sick of this.
[01:28:21.258 --> 01:28:22.038]  I'm sorry to hear that.
[01:28:22.779 --> 01:28:23.839]  Well, can't you be wrong?
[01:28:24.139 --> 01:28:27.001]  But the truth is the truth, you know, and that's what people need to hear.
[01:28:27.441 --> 01:28:27.802]  Exactly.
[01:28:27.822 --> 01:28:32.184]  So we're going to break, come back, long segment, get into all those questions I have and any facets you want to cover.
[01:28:32.664 --> 01:28:34.285]  The Texas Union is a big ballroom.
[01:28:34.866 --> 01:28:36.447]  Correct me, but I think it's about 700 people?
[01:28:36.887 --> 01:28:38.128]  Yeah, approximately 500.
[01:28:38.428 --> 01:28:39.348]  Okay.
[01:28:39.769 --> 01:28:41.330]  So, folks, be sure and be there tonight.
[01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:41.910]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.851 --> 01:28:44.732]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.232 --> 01:28:46.733]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.752 --> 01:28:50.421]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.729 --> 01:28:56.409]  Hey, Bill.
[01:28:56.749 --> 01:28:57.849]  I'm buying lunch today.
[01:28:58.170 --> 01:28:58.990]  And check this out.
[01:28:59.310 --> 01:29:00.210]  I bought a new car.
[01:29:00.290 --> 01:29:00.931]  Wow, John.
[01:29:01.011 --> 01:29:05.512]  I guess you took my advice and visited that website we were talking about over lunch last time we met.
[01:29:06.093 --> 01:29:10.234]  www.didyourobbillgates.com I did, and you were right.
[01:29:10.554 --> 01:29:15.456]  I learned how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[01:29:15.876 --> 01:29:18.337]  And it's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[01:29:18.637 --> 01:29:21.978]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my fifth week.
[01:29:22.219 --> 01:29:23.119]  Whoa, that's awesome!
[01:29:23.479 --> 01:29:25.880]  John, your business will keep growing as mine has.
[01:29:26.220 --> 01:29:28.480]  In fact, people are joining from all over the world.
[01:29:28.580 --> 01:29:29.261]  It's incredible.
[01:29:29.621 --> 01:29:37.083]  Everyone should go to www.DidYouRobBillGates.com and learn how this program can help them become financially independent, too.
[01:29:37.423 --> 01:29:42.344]  Thanks a million, Bill, for telling me about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:29:42.965 --> 01:29:43.665]  Check, please.
[01:29:44.105 --> 01:29:45.005]  I got this one, Bill.
[01:29:45.405 --> 01:29:46.085]  Sure, John.
[01:29:46.225 --> 01:29:50.827]  Let's tell everyone about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:29:50.967 --> 01:29:51.227]  Deal.
[01:29:54.151 --> 01:29:57.632]  As snow falls on the majestic Rocky Mountains, it eventually melts.
[01:29:57.833 --> 01:30:03.695]  The water east of the continental divide travels downhill over 1,600 miles before reaching the Atlantic Ocean.
[01:30:03.875 --> 01:30:06.256]  On the western side, water travels downhill almost a
[01:30:09.980 --> 01:30:10.760]  We're good to go.
[01:30:29.087 --> 01:30:29.807]  We're good to go.
[01:30:29.827 --> 01:30:30.367]  We're good to go.
[01:30:30.387 --> 01:30:31.168]  We're good to go.
[01:30:53.141 --> 01:30:57.482]  If you're tired of spending a small fortune every time you fill up, now you can do something about it.
[01:30:57.702 --> 01:31:04.184]  Ethos FR, a product used all over the world, has reported savings of up to 19% on gas and even reduced emissions of up to 30%.
[01:31:04.264 --> 01:31:09.646]  Ethos FR is easy to use and works with any kind of fuel, including gasoline, diesel, and ethanol.
[01:31:09.826 --> 01:31:17.128]  Ethos FR works by reformulating the gas in your tank to burn more completely, resulting in a cleaner engine, better mileage, more power, and fewer emissions.

[01:31:23.772 --> 01:31:26.253]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[01:31:26.713 --> 01:31:28.614]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[01:31:29.334 --> 01:31:32.495]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[01:31:33.155 --> 01:31:39.618]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[01:31:42.979 --> 01:31:43.419]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:31:43.479 --> 01:31:44.900]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:31:57.646 --> 01:32:04.273]  Coming up in the next segment, we'll have open the phones for Selle Castillo, and he's really an expert on the New World Order, the whole crime syndicate.
[01:32:04.894 --> 01:32:07.877]  So whether it's 9-11, government drug dealing, the Iraq War...
[01:32:08.892 --> 01:32:12.194]  Yes, I have, and thank God that I've had the opportunity to wear all those hats I wear now.
[01:32:12.214 --> 01:32:13.555]  But most important is education.
[01:32:13.595 --> 01:32:16.718]  I think the American people need to be educated and
[01:32:37.323 --> 01:32:37.685]  Absolutely.
[01:32:37.725 --> 01:32:37.926]  Well, it's...
[01:32:41.577 --> 01:32:45.039]  You're right, it's failed for us, but it's done a great job for the crooks around this country.
[01:32:45.199 --> 01:32:52.862]  Well, absolutely, especially with the blueprints of Operation Phoenix in Vietnam.
[01:32:53.082 --> 01:32:58.164]  The same blueprints were brought to Central America and utilized because they worked so perfectly in Vietnam.
[01:32:58.204 --> 01:33:02.166]  Now, let's walk through that, and then I want to get into Posada, the plane bomber.
[01:33:02.406 --> 01:33:07.228]  That's now big in the news, and we're going to hit calls in the next segment, but walk us through...
[01:33:09.089 --> 01:33:11.632]  I remember two years ago, you were talking about torture.
[01:33:11.652 --> 01:33:12.553]  You were talking about Latin America.
[01:33:12.573 --> 01:33:14.675]  You were talking about how they're using these death squads.
[01:33:14.935 --> 01:33:15.696]  Break it down for us.
[01:33:15.916 --> 01:33:25.146]  Well, basically, we have the same cell terrorists that I called that were in Vietnam, Felix Rodriguez and other CIA operatives.
[01:33:25.306 --> 01:33:28.409]  They put in a plan that was later known as Operation On.
[01:33:30.139 --> 01:33:30.499]  Phoenix.
[01:33:30.999 --> 01:33:38.944]  And it was to go out and assassinate anybody who was against the government or sympathetic to the church or schools or whatever.
[01:33:39.465 --> 01:33:47.110]  And they used it and they eliminated thousands of people on assassinating a lot of the young people down there.
[01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:49.951]  And it worked so perfectly, they brought it to Central America.
[01:33:50.352 --> 01:33:53.834]  McCaffrey brought it down to Central America and implemented it into El Salvador.
[01:33:54.434 --> 01:33:56.756]  And basically what they did, they did the same thing.
[01:33:56.776 --> 01:33:58.457]  They went out there and almost...
[01:33:59.076 --> 01:33:59.196]  And...
[01:34:29.361 --> 01:34:43.720]  They're literally... I saw the Latin American reports after you pointed it out, and then it was in the U.S., hiring thousands of former Colombians, Nicaraguans, El Salvadorans, and they're flying them over there
[01:34:44.381 --> 01:34:46.422]  To now kill and torture Iraqis.
[01:34:46.442 --> 01:34:47.322]  This is unbelievable.
[01:34:47.402 --> 01:34:48.302]  Yes, I told you.
[01:34:48.382 --> 01:34:51.743]  When we were in Salvador, we brought in the advisors from Venezuela.
[01:34:51.843 --> 01:34:57.665]  Victor Rivera was one of those guys that was a head guy for the CIA.
[01:34:58.225 --> 01:35:02.126]  And he worked there for about four years in El Salvador.
[01:35:02.806 --> 01:35:05.267]  And, you know, they're bringing in people.
[01:35:05.707 --> 01:35:06.767]  We trained those people.
[01:35:08.128 --> 01:35:12.249]  Now, as we know, a lot of the Caibiles that we trained...
[01:35:13.118 --> 01:35:24.952]  Special forces in El Salvador and Guatemala are now working for the cartels, and they're being hired, and they're mercenaries being hired for money, and they go out there and kill people.
[01:35:25.693 --> 01:35:26.975]  I've seen the press reports.
[01:35:27.255 --> 01:35:29.037]  These mercenaries are getting between $85,000 and $180,000.
[01:35:32.945 --> 01:35:35.048]  And they're not just hiring mercenaries from Latin America.
[01:35:35.088 --> 01:35:38.273]  They're hiring them here from the U.S., Eastern Europe, Western Europe.
[01:35:39.094 --> 01:35:47.405]  I remember seeing ads in newspapers for trying to hire Austin police officers starting at like $100,000 to go over and quote police.
[01:35:47.425 --> 01:35:49.168]  But this is a little different with these mercenaries.
[01:35:49.628 --> 01:35:58.052]  What type of torture, you know, the photos, the documents, the interviews you did, what type of torture were you able to uncover and witness when you were in Central and South America?
[01:35:58.072 --> 01:36:06.356]  In Central America, for example, we grabbed a whole bunch of Colombians that came in with a huge shipment of cocaine, 3,000 kilos.
[01:36:07.196 --> 01:36:15.440]  There were a couple of Mexican girls and their father there, and what they did, they raped them, they tortured them, and when I say torture, they started cutting their arms off, their hands off,
[01:36:16.149 --> 01:36:18.990]  And at the end of the day, they all disappeared.
[01:36:19.050 --> 01:36:25.572]  What they did was they put them all in 55-gallon drums, put holes in them, put them on helicopters, and took them out to sea and dropped them.
[01:36:26.152 --> 01:36:27.932]  So those bodies will never be found.
[01:36:28.232 --> 01:36:31.413]  And this was videotaped by the CIA.
[01:36:31.493 --> 01:36:36.274]  Randy Capster, an agent for the CIA, filmed the whole incident.
[01:36:36.374 --> 01:36:37.755]  So they filmed it for a while?
[01:36:37.955 --> 01:36:39.755]  Well, it's training purposes.
[01:36:39.795 --> 01:36:41.816]  So, for example, the CIA in Guatemala...
[01:36:42.916 --> 01:36:56.526]  In the early part of 1986, had a, believe it or not, a school where they invited all heads of the G2 intelligence unit from Europe and Latin America.
[01:36:56.886 --> 01:37:00.588]  And they brought them down to Guatemala to teach them new techniques on how to torture people.
[01:37:00.608 --> 01:37:04.651]  And so they sat around in darkened rooms watching little girls getting their arms cut off.
[01:37:04.931 --> 01:37:05.351]  Exactly.
[01:37:05.371 --> 01:37:11.616]  And what they did, they brought in human specimens alive and they tortured them and they killed them in front of the,
[01:37:12.377 --> 01:37:12.958]  How in the hell...
[01:37:19.170 --> 01:37:20.771]  And I'm sorry to use that term, but it's true.
[01:37:20.911 --> 01:37:23.133]  How in the world did we sink this low?
[01:37:23.233 --> 01:37:33.661]  And how do people in our government... See, this is so widespread in the culture, though, and it shows us in criminology, you know more about it than I do, that psychopaths always get bolder and bolder.
[01:37:33.681 --> 01:37:34.702]  It's like they want to be caught.
[01:37:36.223 --> 01:37:42.428]  I mean, I'm sure you've seen now the Alberto Gonzalez memos, the John Yoo memos, where they say, we torture children in front of their parents.
[01:37:43.067 --> 01:37:44.649]  I mean, it's one thing to torture children.
[01:37:44.689 --> 01:37:46.330]  That's pure evil, Joseph Mingalo.
[01:37:46.391 --> 01:37:49.053]  But they write it and put the memos out.
[01:37:49.093 --> 01:37:50.455]  I mean, it shows a disconnect.
[01:37:50.515 --> 01:37:53.378]  What do you think is happening when they're writing memos now?
[01:37:53.538 --> 01:38:00.465]  Well, see, that's how arrogant a government has gotten to where they know that nothing's going to happen to them, even if they're prosecuted.
[01:38:01.556 --> 01:38:07.101]  For international crime, at the end of the day... But how do you torture small children?
[01:38:07.121 --> 01:38:11.125]  Well, you know, there's no... First of all, torture doesn't work, never has worked.
[01:38:11.325 --> 01:38:14.468]  But I mean, why are they... I guess they just like it?
[01:38:14.528 --> 01:38:23.776]  Well, no, what they do is they torture a young kid to send out a message to other people that this is going to happen to you if you corroborate with...
[01:38:24.781 --> 01:38:25.342]  With the enemy.
[01:38:25.502 --> 01:38:26.323]  So it's about terror.
[01:38:26.483 --> 01:38:26.923]  Exactly.
[01:38:27.104 --> 01:38:27.744]  Terror.
[01:38:27.965 --> 01:38:30.047]  And, you know, they keep you alive.
[01:38:30.107 --> 01:38:37.555]  There's a book by a nun, an American nun named Diana Ortiz who was tortured in Guatemala and she was able to escape.
[01:38:38.056 --> 01:38:41.159]  But there was an American agent who did the torturing on her and...
[01:38:42.362 --> 01:38:46.505]  She later identified him after I gave her a picture of who I thought it was.
[01:38:47.086 --> 01:38:49.488]  And sure enough, she identified him as the guy who had tortured her.
[01:38:49.508 --> 01:38:53.551]  And that guy was Randy Kempster, who was down in Central America for 10 years.
[01:38:53.611 --> 01:38:55.772]  But the guys that do it, though, have to enjoy it.
[01:38:55.993 --> 01:38:56.473]  Oh, my God.
[01:38:56.713 --> 01:39:04.339]  They enjoy it because they think, you know, it's just like you give a guy a gun and you give him carte blanche to do anything.
[01:39:04.779 --> 01:39:08.062]  And he goes out there and does it and feels pride in what he does.
[01:39:08.795 --> 01:39:17.497]  What is it like for you to be able to look at a video of him cutting little girls' arms out?
[01:39:17.598 --> 01:39:20.238]  It's just, why are you guys doing that?
[01:39:20.738 --> 01:39:23.759]  It's completely wrong what you're doing morally.
[01:39:23.779 --> 01:39:26.860]  He says, well, this is what we do in Latin America.
[01:39:27.740 --> 01:39:33.262]  We have to set an example to let people know that they're not going to come into this country and run drugs without our permission.
[01:39:33.951 --> 01:39:35.271]  And basically that's what they do.
[01:39:35.531 --> 01:39:42.433]  And then what I started doing, you know, that was the first time I became ashamed to be an American.
[01:39:42.973 --> 01:39:44.773]  Because at the beginning... Oh, this is a key point.
[01:39:44.853 --> 01:39:46.154]  I mean, you're this gung-ho guy.
[01:39:46.174 --> 01:39:49.074]  Oh, man, I, you know, American, apple pie, you name it, man.
[01:39:49.134 --> 01:39:50.294]  I was such a patriot.
[01:39:50.394 --> 01:39:55.015]  But when I realized that something was wrong, I started to make excuses.
[01:39:55.075 --> 01:39:56.116]  Maybe there's a reason for that.
[01:39:56.456 --> 01:39:57.736]  And then I was in denial.
[01:39:58.716 --> 01:40:00.056]  And then that's when I said, you know what?
[01:40:00.437 --> 01:40:01.397]  This is completely wrong.
[01:40:01.457 --> 01:40:02.177]  There's no...
[01:40:03.172 --> 01:40:17.078]  Ifs or buts about it, this is wrong, and what I did was I started keeping more detail, documents, pictures, and also on my journals, started writing down what happened to these people.
[01:40:17.778 --> 01:40:23.640]  And I was able to start collecting their original passports, other people who were murdered in Central America.
[01:40:24.221 --> 01:40:25.221]  I have those now with me.
[01:40:25.965 --> 01:40:33.590]  I keep those because it's a reminder and maybe it's a safety for me to have those available in case any time they come after me.
[01:40:33.630 --> 01:40:35.812]  Well, Sully, we talked about this last time you were here.
[01:40:35.892 --> 01:40:36.992]  We're not here thumping our chests.
[01:40:37.012 --> 01:40:38.533]  We're talking about what big men we are.
[01:40:38.633 --> 01:40:39.114]  It's simple.
[01:40:39.134 --> 01:40:46.198]  When you decide to be on the side of light, when you decide to defend the weak, when you decide to fight evil, and it's very empowering, folks.
[01:40:46.238 --> 01:40:52.763]  I wish you could, some of you who haven't decided to step across the line, I wish you could join us and that all of us could someday shoot for the
[01:40:53.443 --> 01:40:56.364]  You know, as a role model, the great things that Sally's done.
[01:40:56.904 --> 01:41:01.125]  But at a certain point, it really is a great peace to know that we're doing the right thing.
[01:41:01.165 --> 01:41:02.585]  We're fighting really evil people.
[01:41:02.745 --> 01:41:04.165]  And I don't care what they do to me.
[01:41:04.205 --> 01:41:07.286]  And I just leave it all in God's hands.
[01:41:07.986 --> 01:41:09.566]  And, you know, you fought for this country.
[01:41:09.706 --> 01:41:10.606]  You believed in Vietnam.
[01:41:10.646 --> 01:41:11.407]  You risked your life there.
[01:41:11.447 --> 01:41:15.247]  You fought for this country here domestically as a police officer and then as a DEA.
[01:41:15.567 --> 01:41:18.008]  And you just continued your service to this country.
[01:41:18.488 --> 01:41:20.009]  And you kept your soul.
[01:41:20.049 --> 01:41:24.612]  A lot of people rationalize and think, well, I guess torture of children or anybody else for that matter is okay.
[01:41:24.632 --> 01:41:26.173]  Can you talk about that process?
[01:41:26.193 --> 01:41:27.534]  I mean, was it gradual?
[01:41:27.694 --> 01:41:29.075]  You said you went into denial.
[01:41:29.395 --> 01:41:31.156]  Did you wake up at 3 a.m.
[01:41:31.176 --> 01:41:33.638]  in a cold sweat like some people do, or was it gradual?
[01:41:33.818 --> 01:41:42.343]  Well, it was, first of all, let me just say that, you know, many years ago I took an oath to protect the Constitution of the United States and its citizens.
[01:41:43.104 --> 01:41:48.146]  And I felt that if I put my life on the line that I would make a difference in preserving my country.
[01:41:48.806 --> 01:41:56.228]  And in reality it turned out that I just could not believe that my government was actually doing this.
[01:41:56.308 --> 01:41:57.069]  And you're right.
[01:41:57.149 --> 01:41:57.929]  I woke up one night
[01:41:58.979 --> 01:41:59.859]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:41:59.939 --> 01:42:02.861]  And then I realized that, you know, I couldn't sleep.
[01:42:02.941 --> 01:42:04.081]  I said, you know, this is wrong.
[01:42:04.742 --> 01:42:06.022]  Of course, it was eating my conscience.
[01:42:06.062 --> 01:42:10.564]  And that's when I decided to start writing about it and let people know what was going on.
[01:42:10.644 --> 01:42:25.651]  Even when I was with the DEA, people said, you know what, when you're reporting to Washington, you're just going to come back and, you know, they're going to fire you or do something with it because you're stepping in people's toes up in the White House and they're not going to let this happen.
[01:42:26.255 --> 01:42:28.776]  So I said, you know, let be what it is.
[01:42:28.796 --> 01:42:31.197]  It's like I was looking for an excuse for them to tell me I was gone.
[01:42:31.897 --> 01:42:34.478]  And at the end of the day, that's basically what happened.
[01:42:34.779 --> 01:42:37.700]  But wasn't it empowering to just take the step and say, I don't care anymore?
[01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:38.700]  Exactly.
[01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:47.284]  You know, I had a job that was paying me close to $100,000 a year, you know, free vehicle, free home, free everything, all tax-free.
[01:42:47.524 --> 01:42:52.806]  And, you know, people, you know, will say, well, you don't have a mortgage to pay.
[01:42:52.846 --> 01:42:53.846]  I have kids.
[01:42:53.886 --> 01:42:55.207]  I have a son in college, and I can't.
[01:42:56.238 --> 01:42:59.279]  And with me, I was looking for a job when I found that job.
[01:42:59.359 --> 01:43:00.759]  So, to me, it was irrelevant.
[01:43:00.819 --> 01:43:05.421]  You know, yeah, I work for the government, but who wants to work for the government when you realize that we are the enemy?
[01:43:05.781 --> 01:43:06.661]  We are the bad guys.
[01:43:06.701 --> 01:43:08.041]  We are the ones that get away with murder.
[01:43:09.102 --> 01:43:12.783]  And see, people think now with the Iraqi war that this is just happening and torturing people.
[01:43:12.823 --> 01:43:14.543]  We go back to Vietnam.
[01:43:15.043 --> 01:43:19.185]  You know, as a matter of fact, I have a big collage of Vietnam, how we tortured people in Vietnam.
[01:43:19.205 --> 01:43:24.006]  Well, the Army's own report, okay, we have two reports, but General Tagumba's report and then a separate report
[01:43:25.427 --> 01:43:30.451]  75-90% of those taken to the 32 camps are completely innocent of even misdemeanors.
[01:43:30.791 --> 01:43:33.433]  They just randomly pick families up that don't have their IDs right.
[01:43:33.754 --> 01:43:37.277]  They take them in with these weirdo former federal prison guards that like this stuff.
[01:43:37.817 --> 01:43:39.518]  And man, they beat fathers to death.
[01:43:39.558 --> 01:43:40.980]  They rape people's daughters.
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:42.961]  They rape them with acid.
[01:43:43.001 --> 01:43:44.042]  I mean, go read the Army Report.
[01:43:44.062 --> 01:43:46.144]  They put acid on them and then shove it inside.
[01:43:46.164 --> 01:43:47.865]  I don't want to go into detail here.
[01:43:48.205 --> 01:43:50.748]  I mean, what in the world are this?
[01:43:50.808 --> 01:43:51.108]  This is...
[01:43:51.568 --> 01:43:52.748]  This is incredible.
[01:43:52.868 --> 01:43:54.249]  I mean, I'm embarrassed.
[01:43:54.489 --> 01:43:55.809]  I'm embarrassed for this country.
[01:43:55.989 --> 01:44:03.331]  You know, and one of the things that the CIA agent once told me, he says, you know what, nobody's ever going to be able to stop us because this is what we do.
[01:44:03.751 --> 01:44:06.331]  We've been doing it for many years and nobody's been able to stop us.
[01:44:06.732 --> 01:44:07.912]  And he was absolutely right.
[01:44:07.952 --> 01:44:10.332]  They can do just about anything and get away with it.
[01:44:10.492 --> 01:44:12.013]  Well, God's going to stop them.
[01:44:12.113 --> 01:44:14.493]  Well, that's the answer to the whole issue here.
[01:44:14.733 --> 01:44:17.554]  And one day they're going to have to answer to a higher up.
[01:44:19.498 --> 01:44:20.558]  A lot of them are atheists.
[01:44:20.699 --> 01:44:22.559]  They don't believe that.
[01:44:23.139 --> 01:44:26.020]  Still, I think you get judged in this world.
[01:44:26.681 --> 01:44:29.462]  I think when you do bad things, it comes back on you.
[01:44:30.362 --> 01:44:30.862]  Absolutely.
[01:44:30.902 --> 01:44:31.662]  You know these people, though.
[01:44:31.682 --> 01:44:32.663]  Are they happy people?
[01:44:32.723 --> 01:44:33.383]  Not only that.
[01:44:33.803 --> 01:44:42.286]  One of the things that American people don't realize is the fact that they're now getting involved because it's happening to one of their families.
[01:44:43.138 --> 01:44:49.702]  Or, you know, whether it's racial profiling by the cops or tortured by the cops or beaten up by the cops or in the military.
[01:44:50.163 --> 01:44:55.746]  As you can see, all military females there in the military, one out of three has been raped.
[01:44:55.966 --> 01:44:56.527]  Yeah, they have.
[01:44:56.827 --> 01:45:01.930]  So, you know, our own recruiters, our own people.
[01:45:02.070 --> 01:45:03.211]  We're turning into animals.
[01:45:03.591 --> 01:45:04.051]  Exactly.
[01:45:04.151 --> 01:45:06.453]  We're worse than anything else.
[01:45:06.533 --> 01:45:11.336]  And I've always said that we're the worst human rights violators in the Western Hemisphere.
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:13.381]  We've been it for so many years.
[01:45:13.401 --> 01:45:13.861]  There's no doubt.
[01:45:14.101 --> 01:45:15.042]  There's no doubt about that.
[01:45:15.482 --> 01:45:20.946]  We live the blood trail out in Latin America with Pinochet and Chile.
[01:45:21.947 --> 01:45:22.367]  No wonder.
[01:45:22.827 --> 01:45:26.270]  People think that Latin Americans are a bunch of stupid communists who just hate us.
[01:45:26.570 --> 01:45:28.411]  No, they're good, hard-working people.
[01:45:28.451 --> 01:45:29.572]  They're not communists.
[01:45:29.592 --> 01:45:31.293]  The only alternative they've been given is the communists.
[01:45:31.933 --> 01:45:34.255]  And they just see this happen and they're sick of it.
[01:45:34.295 --> 01:45:36.196]  How would we like living like this?
[01:45:36.236 --> 01:45:38.237]  Well, here's the bad news and the good news in a way.
[01:45:38.537 --> 01:45:39.298]  It's coming here now.
[01:45:39.798 --> 01:45:40.198]  Exactly.
[01:45:40.298 --> 01:45:42.040]  And so we're going to get a taste of what it's like.
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:42.660]  Exactly.
[01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:44.081]  And we got it in 9-11.
[01:45:44.981 --> 01:45:45.462]  We got it.
[01:45:45.702 --> 01:45:54.787]  And when I saw 9-11, I remember people getting all upset because 3,000 people died at the World Trade Center, which is okay.
[01:45:54.807 --> 01:45:57.309]  But what happened to the half a million people that were slaughtered?
[01:45:58.032 --> 01:46:02.638]  By our own dad squads that we trained in Central America back in the 80s.
[01:46:02.938 --> 01:46:05.461]  Oh, but that's okay because that's what happened in third world countries.
[01:46:06.383 --> 01:46:10.588]  But then when he came home, as they say, the seeking came home to roost.
[01:46:11.505 --> 01:46:14.408]  You know, we're not saying, oh, wait a minute, you know?
[01:46:14.428 --> 01:46:17.631]  And you're talking about the response of the people themselves.
[01:46:18.011 --> 01:46:20.453]  You really look at 9-11, Sully, and I know you've looked at it.
[01:46:20.774 --> 01:46:21.774]  Clearly an inside job.
[01:46:21.794 --> 01:46:22.515]  Give me your take.
[01:46:22.615 --> 01:46:23.116]  Absolutely.
[01:46:23.376 --> 01:46:23.856]  Absolutely.
[01:46:23.976 --> 01:46:25.077]  And that's what they needed to do.
[01:46:25.097 --> 01:46:29.021]  The CIA was at the verge of being dissolved.
[01:46:29.725 --> 01:46:31.706]  And they had to do something to bring that back.
[01:46:31.746 --> 01:46:33.807]  It's like BATF's in trouble so they do Waco.
[01:46:33.867 --> 01:46:34.547]  It never ends.
[01:46:34.647 --> 01:46:35.087]  Exactly.
[01:46:35.207 --> 01:46:37.988]  And we've known to do that for many, many years.
[01:46:38.088 --> 01:46:40.749]  And, you know, there's a history to show that we've done that.
[01:46:40.789 --> 01:46:41.570]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:46:41.610 --> 01:46:48.832]  Whenever you talk to your former DEA partners or police you know or others, I mean, because I see people now starting to wake up.
[01:46:49.373 --> 01:46:53.114]  But I want to ask you, are you starting to see an acceleration in people waking up?
[01:46:53.971 --> 01:46:54.291]  I do.
[01:46:54.591 --> 01:46:57.733]  The problem with that is that older people have been there for a while.
[01:46:58.254 --> 01:47:09.020]  See, they're realizing that, well, they're not realizing, they've known it's happening, but now they're getting ready to quit or retire or whatever, and now they've got the kids to think about it, and now they're kind of speaking out about it.
[01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:17.145]  But, you know, I do have a lot of friends that still call and tell me that I'm doing a good job, and I get emails from police officers saying, you know,
[01:47:18.065 --> 01:47:24.448]  You know, I wish we could say something about this and that, but we can't because we have a mortgage to pay and we have our kids going to college and so forth.
[01:47:25.069 --> 01:47:36.875]  And that's why a lot of the American people that are knowledgeable about all these atrocities won't get involved because they have a... Yeah, but I mean, don't they know none of us are safe when this evil grows?
[01:47:37.195 --> 01:47:39.696]  Notice this evil doesn't stop in Latin America.
[01:47:39.996 --> 01:47:40.977]  It goes to Iraq.
[01:47:41.017 --> 01:47:41.957]  It goes to the U.S.
[01:47:41.977 --> 01:47:42.978]  It goes to Eastern Europe.
[01:47:44.018 --> 01:47:47.220]  Of course, Sully, I know you follow the news and I want to get into...
[01:47:48.203 --> 01:47:49.243]  Posada here in a minute.
[01:47:49.743 --> 01:47:51.684]  But they spin everything.
[01:47:52.144 --> 01:47:53.284]  Bush says, I'm above the law.
[01:47:53.304 --> 01:47:54.884]  I'm allowed to secretly arrest citizens.
[01:47:55.384 --> 01:47:59.245]  They put it in a bill, along with no more Fourth Amendment, unlimited NSA spying.
[01:47:59.265 --> 01:47:59.925]  It's already going on.
[01:47:59.945 --> 01:48:01.545]  Now they just want to codify it and legalize it.
[01:48:02.085 --> 01:48:03.706]  And they call it a defeat of Bush.
[01:48:03.886 --> 01:48:07.506]  The Senate's passing this when it's actually exactly what he asked for.
[01:48:07.766 --> 01:48:16.008]  Then they spin it in the media like you're getting your freedoms when the bill does the opposite and it codifies into law the secret arrest of American citizens.
[01:48:16.348 --> 01:48:17.488]  I mean, this is bone-chilling.
[01:48:17.908 --> 01:48:32.050]  Yeah, well, basically, I have an assistant United States attorney, Adam McAllen, who has now labeled me as a domestic terrorist, because I go out and I protest the war once a month on a Sunday afternoon in front of the federal building, and...
[01:48:33.603 --> 01:48:44.232]  I could get picked up any day now because of what I... We have the new training manuals for people that protest war, people that protest for land rights, people that... It doesn't matter whether you're liberal, conservative.
[01:48:44.673 --> 01:48:46.514]  You could be Minuteman or you could be liberal.
[01:48:46.554 --> 01:48:48.276]  They're just listing us all as terrorists.
[01:48:48.376 --> 01:48:49.256]  How did you find out about this?
[01:48:49.717 --> 01:48:54.381]  Well, I had one of the attorneys that... I had one of my clients that...
[01:48:56.479 --> 01:49:12.987]  He had declined, and they told the attorney, he said, you tell Sally Castillo that he's now documented as a domestic terrorist, and we're going to find a way to get him, and when we do, you know, he's not going to be able to speak, because we're going to put him away for, you know, hide him from public and everybody else.
[01:49:13.107 --> 01:49:20.311]  So even these locals now are getting off on the anti-terror powers, and you tell Sally Castillo it's over with him.
[01:49:20.531 --> 01:49:22.132]  Yeah, exactly, and you know,
[01:49:22.790 --> 01:49:27.451]  As far as I'm concerned, I've made my peace with God, and I've been on borrowed time since Vietnam.
[01:49:27.971 --> 01:49:29.312]  So there's nothing they can do to me.
[01:49:29.592 --> 01:49:37.173]  But what cowardly little worms... Well, that's basically the attitude that they get.
[01:49:37.193 --> 01:49:45.095]  They're arrogant, and they think that at the end of the day, George Bush will pardon them before he leaves office.
[01:49:45.435 --> 01:49:46.876]  And that's why they do what they do.
[01:49:48.936 --> 01:49:49.936]  Organized crime.
[01:49:49.956 --> 01:49:52.037]  We're going to come back, talk more, and take your calls.
[01:49:56.557 --> 01:49:59.740]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:02.022]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:02.382 --> 01:50:10.068]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.708 --> 01:50:17.774]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.174 --> 01:50:21.117]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq.
[01:50:21.457 --> 01:50:23.819]  The White House probing to disseminate fake news.
[01:50:24.239 --> 01:50:25.040]  NSA spies.
[01:50:26.469 --> 01:50:29.651]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[01:50:29.891 --> 01:50:33.392]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.872 --> 01:50:35.773]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.113 --> 01:50:40.015]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:53.357 --> 01:50:56.520]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:50:56.560 --> 01:51:00.603]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:51:00.723 --> 01:51:03.305]  But if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:51:03.365 --> 01:51:05.667]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:51:05.867 --> 01:51:14.314]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:51:14.394 --> 01:51:15.715]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:51:15.835 --> 01:51:19.838]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:51:19.858 --> 01:51:23.540]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.

[01:52:54.128 --> 01:52:56.871]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:52:56.891 --> 01:53:00.735]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:02.521 --> 01:53:11.219]  Luis Posada, he's in my film Terror Storm, going around blowing up airplanes, bombing people, and then blaming it on foreign enemies.
[01:53:12.140 --> 01:53:14.281]  He is being held, supposedly, in a Texas prison.
[01:53:14.301 --> 01:53:15.241]  I don't even believe that.
[01:53:15.682 --> 01:53:17.943]  And the government is saying they're now about to release him.
[01:53:17.963 --> 01:53:19.843]  We're going to start the next hour in four minutes.
[01:53:19.863 --> 01:53:23.845]  We'll go to Brian, Chris, Jeff, Dave, John, I promise, directly with Sully Costello.
[01:53:24.165 --> 01:53:28.647]  But one of the things you've been writing about and speaking about is this Posada character.
[01:53:28.967 --> 01:53:29.928]  Tell us about him, Sully.
[01:53:30.388 --> 01:53:34.049]  Well, basically, it's an individual that's been an American terrorist for many, many years.
[01:53:34.089 --> 01:53:37.471]  He met Felix Rodriguez, who ran the Ilopongo Airport.
[01:53:37.531 --> 01:53:39.992]  Posada was in jail in Venezuela back in the early 80s.
[01:53:41.104 --> 01:53:46.166]  And Oliver North and Felix Rodriguez, the CIA operative, helped him escape.
[01:53:47.046 --> 01:53:53.348]  He was in jail up there for the bombing of the Cuban airline that killed approximately 76 people.
[01:53:54.048 --> 01:54:04.952]  Anyway, so basically they brought him to Central America to run the drug trafficking operation out of Ilopango Airport and, you know, set up some terrorist activity in Guatemala.
[01:54:05.692 --> 01:54:10.614]  So I met Luis Posadas Carriles there in Guatemala
[01:54:11.397 --> 01:54:13.118]  And at Ilopongo Airport.
[01:54:13.198 --> 01:54:14.839]  And that was reported to the U.S.
[01:54:14.879 --> 01:54:20.603]  Ambassador, Edwin Corr, in reference to my discovery of this individual.
[01:54:21.604 --> 01:54:24.526]  And he kept saying, it's a covert operation being run by the White House.
[01:54:24.566 --> 01:54:25.867]  You know, we can't get involved in that.
[01:54:26.427 --> 01:54:33.492]  And basically, this guy is an American-born terrorist who worked for George Bush Sr.
[01:54:34.252 --> 01:54:38.735]  And basically, when Bush was the director of the CIA...
[01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:43.503]  I hired him and... Were they mad that Cuba won three gold medals?
[01:54:43.543 --> 01:54:44.664]  Why'd they blow up that plane?
[01:54:45.744 --> 01:54:46.425]  Just to blow it up.
[01:54:46.765 --> 01:54:55.972]  Just to, you know... And what they did kill were students, the fencing team for the Cubans, National Cuba country there.
[01:54:56.172 --> 01:54:58.494]  And they killed a whole bunch of kids.
[01:54:58.714 --> 01:55:00.035]  That's what it was.
[01:55:00.636 --> 01:55:03.398]  76 young kids that they blew up.
[01:55:04.739 --> 01:55:06.701]  And there's another guy named Roland...
[01:55:08.144 --> 01:55:12.706]  Bush, who was pardoned, another American terrorist, who was pardoned by Bush in 1991.
[01:55:13.266 --> 01:55:16.428]  And they just do it over and over again.
[01:55:16.448 --> 01:55:20.490]  I mean, BBC, Associated Press, they all admit our government staged these attacks.
[01:55:21.230 --> 01:55:23.731]  And then, of course, at the time, they were trying to claim Cubans did it.
[01:55:24.031 --> 01:55:25.972]  It just never ends.
[01:55:27.093 --> 01:55:27.473]  Exactly.
[01:55:27.493 --> 01:55:27.993]  It never ends.
[01:55:28.053 --> 01:55:31.875]  And this guy now, he came in illegally into this country.
[01:55:32.695 --> 01:55:35.897]  And he had a press conference with the Cuban exiles.
[01:55:35.997 --> 01:55:36.197]  I mean,
[01:55:36.809 --> 01:55:47.597]  In Miami, and right after the press conference, he came in illegally trying to tell the Bush administration that if he gets arrested, then he knows where the skeletons are buried.
[01:55:48.198 --> 01:55:55.904]  So to keep him quiet, they picked him up and they threw him in a facility there in El Paso, and now no country wants him.
[01:55:57.436 --> 01:56:00.677]  And they will not extradite him to Cuba or to Venezuela.
[01:56:00.717 --> 01:56:04.518]  So now the Constitution says... But he's been convicted down there.
[01:56:04.558 --> 01:56:06.138]  They need to send him down to Venezuela.
[01:56:06.338 --> 01:56:06.878]  Absolutely.
[01:56:07.118 --> 01:56:19.101]  So how is it possible that we can always request the extradition of an American, but when it's their turn to ask for the extradition of one of their own, they will not send him there?
[01:56:19.983 --> 01:56:21.344]  Well, we've been griping in Mexico.
[01:56:21.404 --> 01:56:22.284]  I think rightfully so.
[01:56:22.324 --> 01:56:25.346]  They won't extradite up here, even with cop killers.
[01:56:25.426 --> 01:56:28.968]  But we're doing the same thing on extraditing this convicted murderer.
[01:56:29.188 --> 01:56:38.513]  Yeah, and I remember the president saying, you know, we will not tolerate terrorism, and yet we have our own terrorists, and they're being protected by the White House, and they're not being released.
[01:56:39.753 --> 01:56:41.194]  He's going to be released next week.
[01:56:41.214 --> 01:56:44.696]  They're going to release him here in the U.S.
[01:56:45.676 --> 01:56:48.898]  Although he's an illegal alien, he came in with a... Well, that's another thing.
[01:56:49.954 --> 01:56:51.275]  It just never ends.
[01:56:51.315 --> 01:56:53.976]  They break whatever laws they want whenever they want.
[01:56:54.216 --> 01:56:54.636]  Exactly.
[01:56:54.816 --> 01:57:00.699]  And they get away with it, and this guy is known as the Osama Bin Laden of Latin America.
[01:57:01.099 --> 01:57:02.159]  That's how many people he killed.
[01:57:02.559 --> 01:57:07.261]  Can't people call the Border Patrol and demand they be waiting outside the prison to take him in on immigration charges?
[01:57:07.321 --> 01:57:11.803]  Well, no, because they all answer the Department of Justice, and you know who's in charge of the Department of Justice.
[01:57:12.043 --> 01:57:12.604]  Gonzalez.
[01:57:13.144 --> 01:57:13.664]  Oh, man.
[01:57:15.045 --> 01:57:17.906]  The Enron lawyer that writes memos saying Bush is the law.
[01:57:19.148 --> 01:57:19.868]  Stay there, folks.
[01:57:19.888 --> 01:57:25.129]  We're going to come back and take your calls and get into a host of other issues with Sully Costello.
[01:57:25.229 --> 01:57:28.690]  He's got a whole raft of important issues he's here to cover with us.
[01:57:28.730 --> 01:57:29.851]  Third hour straight ahead.
[01:57:33.011 --> 01:57:37.592]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.517 --> 01:57:50.177]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.838 --> 01:57:51.898]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.598 --> 01:57:53.719]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.379 --> 01:57:55.180]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.940 --> 01:57:57.861]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.881 --> 01:58:01.263]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.683 --> 01:58:05.805]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.886 --> 01:58:12.829]  I interviewed the former governor, former Navy SEAL, former movie star, wrestler,
[01:58:14.179 --> 01:58:18.767]  Jesse, the mind Ventura last night, and he said more about 9-11 than he's ever said before.
[01:58:18.807 --> 01:58:21.973]  He went public on it, saying he does question the official story.
[01:58:24.176 --> 01:58:26.837]  And I'll recap that interview before this hour ends.
[01:58:26.857 --> 01:58:29.999]  I'll spend a few minutes recapping what happened in that sit-down video interview.
[01:58:30.279 --> 01:58:33.741]  It'll be up on the website tonight on Infowars.com.
[01:58:34.161 --> 01:58:37.783]  The first place it will be is JonesReport.com because that webmaster is so dedicated.
[01:58:38.183 --> 01:58:39.303]  He's also the video editor.
[01:58:39.323 --> 01:58:43.765]  Aaron Dykes, we're going to be up here tonight to make sure it's a good edit.
[01:58:44.286 --> 01:58:49.248]  And then we're going to post it up to YouTube, or if it's too long, to Google Video.
[01:58:49.568 --> 01:58:50.929]  And then we'll put it up tonight.
[01:58:50.949 --> 01:58:53.210]  It'll be up on JonesReport first.
[01:58:54.079 --> 01:58:57.402]  And then tomorrow it'll be up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[01:58:57.983 --> 01:59:03.909]  And Paul Watson's writing an article about the interview right now that'll be up in the next few hours as well.
[01:59:03.989 --> 01:59:05.070]  It is huge news.
[01:59:06.403 --> 01:59:14.008]  Also, I've got a lot of other news here that I want to be going over concerning the police state, CIA spying, CIA drug dealing, Los Zetas.
[01:59:14.048 --> 01:59:15.449]  It's really controlled by our government.
[01:59:16.230 --> 01:59:19.292]  These drug gangs running all over the Southwest, predominantly Texas.
[01:59:19.913 --> 01:59:21.214]  Selleck Castillo is our guest.
[01:59:21.354 --> 01:59:22.495]  We said we'd take your calls.
[01:59:22.575 --> 01:59:23.596]  We will do it now.
[01:59:24.016 --> 01:59:25.797]  Let's talk to Brian in Ohio.
[01:59:25.837 --> 01:59:27.559]  You're on the air worldwide, Brian.
[01:59:28.199 --> 01:59:28.699]  Hello, Alex.
[01:59:29.160 --> 01:59:29.380]  Hi.
[01:59:29.400 --> 01:59:31.161]  I appreciate what you're doing there.
[01:59:31.301 --> 01:59:34.704]  Just want to let you know I'm a recent InfoWars subscriber.
[01:59:35.362 --> 01:59:37.903]  And I've been doing a lot of my own research in the past year.
[01:59:38.384 --> 01:59:50.330]  And one thing that's kind of come to light to me with all of this research that I've done is, you know, it's basically an awakening, like you said in the earlier segment.
[01:59:52.311 --> 01:59:59.135]  There's an assumption, it seems like, in America that we're... I was one of those people that was kind of off just letting the government run itself.
[01:59:59.155 --> 02:00:00.196]  Yeah, we're the good guys.
[02:00:00.256 --> 02:00:04.318]  And in truth, what we are is a bunch of naive people, on average, run by demons.
[02:00:04.975 --> 02:00:09.838]  Yeah, and as a Christian, I kind of swallowed the pill as far as Bush's Christianity.
[02:00:09.898 --> 02:00:17.122]  And then what didn't make sense to me after that was when I looked at Karl Rove and what his history has been with his campaign orchestrations and whatnot.
[02:00:17.442 --> 02:00:22.685]  But a lot of stuff is covered on your website in terms of the Federal Reserve.
[02:00:23.285 --> 02:00:27.127]  Calling George Bush a Christian is like calling Beelzebub Jesus.
[02:00:27.428 --> 02:00:27.668]  Right.
[02:00:29.442 --> 02:00:31.784]  Well, the truth is stranger than fiction.
[02:00:31.804 --> 02:00:32.305]  It really is.
[02:00:32.325 --> 02:00:44.133]  When I've looked at the facts, like Norman Dodd's interview in 1982 on the 1954 Reese Commission and what they discovered with the tax-exempt Rockefeller and the Carnegie Foundations.
[02:00:44.233 --> 02:00:46.855]  What amazes me is this stuff is in print.
[02:00:48.216 --> 02:00:52.880]  The recent things that are coming to light with the Patriot Act and we're talking about this
[02:00:53.453 --> 02:00:54.313]  Expanding the borders.
[02:00:55.213 --> 02:00:59.414]  I guess what I want to know is I would encourage everyone to do their own research.
[02:00:59.755 --> 02:01:05.376]  What you're saying is you checked into this stuff and you found out it's true and this is darn serious.
[02:01:05.416 --> 02:01:06.256]  People better look at it.
[02:01:07.476 --> 02:01:09.397]  I've heard you issue that challenge.
[02:01:09.437 --> 02:01:10.897]  We can back up what we're saying.
[02:01:11.257 --> 02:01:13.398]  Listen, folks, you can't just deny what we're saying out of hand.
[02:01:13.438 --> 02:01:14.358]  You better go look it up.
[02:01:14.378 --> 02:01:15.338]  The point is this.
[02:01:15.538 --> 02:01:18.219]  You really need to insert yourself to excerpt yourself.
[02:01:18.735 --> 02:01:25.539]  And I think the day of just assuming we're in a utopia, and that's what I've been guilty of, is, hey, my life is good and full here.
[02:01:26.059 --> 02:01:28.241]  And I felt a little bit guilty for not really being involved.
[02:01:28.261 --> 02:01:32.023]  Yeah, we have a responsibility to defend those that are being abused, or it'll end up happening to us, Sully.
[02:01:32.923 --> 02:01:34.964]  Absolutely, and we need to just education.
[02:01:34.984 --> 02:01:37.366]  I've always said education is the name of the game here.
[02:01:37.426 --> 02:01:41.668]  We need to educate as many people as we can to let them know what's going on in this country.
[02:01:42.749 --> 02:01:43.309]  We've got to do it.
[02:01:43.329 --> 02:01:44.470]  I mean, we're in a race against time.
[02:01:45.327 --> 02:01:46.948]  You know, it's kind of late to save ourselves.
[02:01:46.988 --> 02:01:52.572]  You know, it's going to be our grandkids we need to save now because our kids are also not savable right now.
[02:01:52.592 --> 02:01:56.435]  But it's going to get worse before it gets better, if it gets better.
[02:01:56.895 --> 02:01:58.136]  Now, unfortunately, I agree with you.
[02:01:58.176 --> 02:02:01.819]  We've reached a terminal corruption and decadence and evil.
[02:02:02.559 --> 02:02:05.041]  And right now, we're going into bondage.
[02:02:05.061 --> 02:02:09.264]  And the question is, will we have the core that will then recognize it and resist it to get the country back?
[02:02:09.825 --> 02:02:10.165]  Exactly.
[02:02:11.329 --> 02:02:14.311]  Okay, well, listen, I appreciate your fine comments, Brian.
[02:02:14.331 --> 02:02:18.833]  We're going to break, and when we come back after break, we're going to talk to Chris, Jeff, Dave, John.
[02:02:18.853 --> 02:02:20.714]  I'm going to get through all these calls that have been holding forever.
[02:02:20.734 --> 02:02:21.214]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:21.234 --> 02:02:23.115]  What a novel idea to get my toll-free number out on there.
[02:02:26.442 --> 02:02:27.242]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:27.422 --> 02:02:32.345]  Shelly Costello, author of Powder Burns.
[02:02:33.025 --> 02:02:33.786]  I forgot to tell you about that.
[02:02:33.806 --> 02:02:34.466]  We'll tell you about the book.
[02:02:34.786 --> 02:02:35.606]  We carry it.
[02:02:35.666 --> 02:02:36.607]  It's almost out of print.
[02:02:36.987 --> 02:02:38.628]  We've got some copies here of it.
[02:02:38.688 --> 02:02:39.628]  You really need to get it.
[02:02:40.189 --> 02:02:40.929]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:41.069 --> 02:02:42.450]  Shelly will be speaking on the defense tonight.
[02:02:42.510 --> 02:02:44.311]  We'll tell you more about that, too.
[02:02:48.294 --> 02:02:51.475]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:51.835 --> 02:02:53.755]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:54.115 --> 02:03:01.777]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.457 --> 02:03:09.518]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:09.919 --> 02:03:12.859]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:03:13.239 --> 02:03:15.540]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[02:03:15.980 --> 02:03:16.800]  NSA spies.
[02:03:18.230 --> 02:03:21.332]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[02:03:21.632 --> 02:03:25.153]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:25.613 --> 02:03:27.534]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:27.874 --> 02:03:31.776]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:46.385 --> 02:03:51.047]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:03:51.387 --> 02:03:55.589]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:03:55.909 --> 02:03:56.469]  We listened.
[02:03:56.789 --> 02:04:01.912]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:04:02.212 --> 02:04:02.692]  We listened.
[02:04:03.092 --> 02:04:06.233]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:04:06.654 --> 02:04:07.214]  We listened.
[02:04:07.694 --> 02:04:09.855]  You asked us to include an emergency light for
[02:04:13.102 --> 02:04:18.505]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:04:18.925 --> 02:04:20.326]  Again, we listened.
[02:04:20.706 --> 02:04:28.250]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:04:28.730 --> 02:04:31.454]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water purifier.
[02:04:31.655 --> 02:04:31.855]  Only $279.
[02:04:31.895 --> 02:04:32.516]  Call new Millennium 888-803-4438.
[02:04:32.576 --> 02:04:32.817]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:32.877 --> 02:04:34.259]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:04:34.279 --> 02:04:35.060]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:45.524 --> 02:04:48.805]  Do you remember when you could eat most anything and not worry about it?
[02:04:49.305 --> 02:04:51.466]  Or maybe weight management has always been a problem.
[02:04:51.986 --> 02:04:57.348]  Are you frustrated, burned out, and tired of fad diets and marketing gimmicks that don't really work?
[02:04:57.888 --> 02:05:03.750]  Do you want a proven system, a long-term solution to live a healthier lifestyle and properly manage your weight?
[02:05:04.520 --> 02:05:07.604]  At WeCanTogether.com, our approach is different.

[02:05:13.410 --> 02:05:15.453]  Individual needs and personal goals.
[02:05:15.993 --> 02:05:18.196]  Not the cookie cutter approach offered by others.

[02:05:44.992 --> 02:05:50.034]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.394 --> 02:05:52.735]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:58.437 --> 02:06:00.238]  Sheldon Costello is our guest in studio.
[02:06:00.258 --> 02:06:01.658]  We're about to go straight back to your calls.
[02:06:01.678 --> 02:06:02.879]  I didn't plug this in the last hour.
[02:06:02.899 --> 02:06:03.339]  I should have.
[02:06:03.739 --> 02:06:05.940]  We have his book, Powder Burns.
[02:06:06.983 --> 02:06:07.183]  Absolutely.
[02:06:07.203 --> 02:06:08.224]  I've got about 500 left, and that's basically it.
[02:06:08.244 --> 02:06:09.265]  I'm trying to get a publisher to...
[02:06:27.017 --> 02:06:28.817]  To come in and help me reprint.
[02:06:29.078 --> 02:06:30.718]  And I think we've got like 400 of them.
[02:06:30.758 --> 02:06:34.159]  We've got like maybe, I think it's 75, 80 left, Kevin was saying.
[02:06:34.519 --> 02:06:37.019]  So if you want Powder Burns, we have them on InfoWars.com.
[02:06:37.039 --> 02:06:38.020]  Those will sell out soon.
[02:06:38.340 --> 02:06:41.121]  We'll buy more of what Selly's got left if he'll sell them to us.
[02:06:41.601 --> 02:06:47.002]  And then we need to get an updated version, I guess, of Powder Burns republished.
[02:06:47.322 --> 02:06:47.742]  Exactly.
[02:06:48.182 --> 02:06:49.943]  Hopefully a second edition on it.
[02:06:50.283 --> 02:06:51.463]  It's a very important testament.
[02:06:51.483 --> 02:06:56.885]  So if you want Powder Burns, it's available at Infowars.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:06:58.506 --> 02:07:03.847]  And Terror Storm, by the way, my new film, is out on DVD with over 68 minutes of extras on it.
[02:07:03.867 --> 02:07:05.468]  So we're three hours on one DVD.
[02:07:05.788 --> 02:07:06.668]  Let's go back to the calls.
[02:07:06.708 --> 02:07:08.529]  Let's talk to Chris in Maine.
[02:07:08.809 --> 02:07:09.409]  Thanks for holding.
[02:07:09.429 --> 02:07:10.009]  You're on the air.
[02:07:10.790 --> 02:07:12.070]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[02:07:12.570 --> 02:07:12.830]  Good, sir.
[02:07:12.870 --> 02:07:13.410]  What's on your mind?
[02:07:14.031 --> 02:07:14.711]  Well, um...
[02:07:15.287 --> 02:07:22.091]  I pretty much just, you know, hopped on the net and I was listening to your guys' conversation and I decided to call, you know, and... Sure, what's on your mind?
[02:07:22.732 --> 02:07:36.581]  The only thing I really have on my mind is, like, we keep talking about, you guys keep talking about, like, you know, all the deaths and everything and it's like, it's only spawned more and more death and as it's spawning more and more death,
[02:07:36.994 --> 02:07:44.808]  That's less and less likely that we're going to run across, you know, the person who has the cure for AIDS or cancer or power problems or anything.
[02:07:44.848 --> 02:07:50.278]  I mean, we might have just killed, you know, today, right now, we might have just killed the next Albert Einstein.
[02:07:51.255 --> 02:08:00.907]  Well, more than that, we've killed our soul because when, as a society, collectively, we let our leaders write memos saying they can torture children, we've entered hell.
[02:08:00.927 --> 02:08:03.230]  That is wrong in every sense of the word.
[02:08:03.270 --> 02:08:04.771]  I don't care what religion you are.
[02:08:05.192 --> 02:08:09.137]  Torturing anybody, death in general, is just wrong and should not be.
[02:08:09.737 --> 02:08:10.897]  I mean, even in war.
[02:08:10.917 --> 02:08:11.797]  I mean, come on.
[02:08:12.118 --> 02:08:17.058]  My point is not even the Nazis wrote public memos about torturing children.
[02:08:17.078 --> 02:08:17.719]  They just did it.
[02:08:18.219 --> 02:08:19.999]  I mean, this is lower than the Nazis.
[02:08:20.019 --> 02:08:21.979]  And when I say that, Selway, you want to comment on that statement?
[02:08:22.219 --> 02:08:22.780]  Absolutely.
[02:08:22.860 --> 02:08:30.161]  They're caught once to do whatever you want to do, and they write about it, and they're not worried not one bit about getting prosecuted for it.
[02:08:31.061 --> 02:08:35.282]  And it's so sad because it's gotten to this point to where they're so arrogant about
[02:08:36.448 --> 02:08:42.451]  They're worse than any other dictator in this world that killed thousands and thousands of people.
[02:08:43.952 --> 02:08:45.932]  The only thing holding them back is the Second Amendment.
[02:08:45.972 --> 02:08:47.573]  If they could get our guns, they'd move.
[02:08:47.833 --> 02:08:50.915]  The Houston Chronicle reported on the FEMA camps they've got for citizens.
[02:08:51.895 --> 02:08:52.315]  Exactly.
[02:08:52.595 --> 02:08:54.316]  So, you know, that's the next step.
[02:08:54.456 --> 02:09:00.579]  And that's going to be a big fight because I myself will not give up my gun.
[02:09:01.468 --> 02:09:02.669]  Well, we were talking during the break.
[02:09:02.769 --> 02:09:10.578]  I mean, I think arrogant dictators in these plutocracies always get arrogant, decadent, and out of control.
[02:09:10.618 --> 02:09:12.941]  And I think we're starting to see an overplaying of the hand.
[02:09:13.241 --> 02:09:13.701]  What do you think?
[02:09:14.002 --> 02:09:15.744]  Yeah, I think they crossed the line.
[02:09:16.364 --> 02:09:18.206]  I think they're not turning back.
[02:09:18.226 --> 02:09:21.149]  They're going to go forward full speed and...
[02:09:22.766 --> 02:09:23.527]  What happens, happens.
[02:09:24.068 --> 02:09:25.349]  There's no starting back.
[02:09:25.389 --> 02:09:29.354]  Did you see that when you took criminology to be a police officer in the DEA?
[02:09:29.374 --> 02:09:39.304]  Because I just know, as a layman reading some books on criminology and some psychology I had in college, that that's what psychopaths and control freaks and murderers do, is they get wilder and wilder.
[02:09:39.425 --> 02:09:40.706]  They want to get caught.
[02:09:40.766 --> 02:09:41.327]  It's like a...
[02:09:42.154 --> 02:09:45.136]  Yes, but even when they get caught, they get released.
[02:09:45.556 --> 02:09:47.457]  And we got Posadas as an example.
[02:09:47.477 --> 02:09:52.960]  The guy who killed people, Bosch, who killed a whole bunch of people also.
[02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:53.721]  And guess what?
[02:09:54.481 --> 02:09:55.722]  They were pardoned at the end of the day.
[02:09:56.494 --> 02:09:58.755]  And, you know, they're going to go back and do the same thing.
[02:09:59.055 --> 02:10:01.435]  So this is a higher class of criminal.
[02:10:01.475 --> 02:10:03.356]  It's not like the street serial killer.
[02:10:03.616 --> 02:10:08.137]  These are serial killers, a society of killers, who get out of jail free cards.
[02:10:08.317 --> 02:10:08.737]  Exactly.
[02:10:08.777 --> 02:10:15.239]  They will never, ever be prosecuted, whether it's in international courts or here in the U.S.
[02:10:15.279 --> 02:10:17.299]  You can see for Posada, you know, he's a criminal.
[02:10:18.340 --> 02:10:22.541]  He came into this country illegally, and he's not being prosecuted for that.
[02:10:22.841 --> 02:10:23.981]  He's going to be released next week.
[02:10:25.874 --> 02:10:26.494]  Shameful.
[02:10:27.375 --> 02:10:30.136]  Chris, anything else you want to add?
[02:10:31.116 --> 02:10:31.856]  No, not really.
[02:10:31.936 --> 02:10:33.497]  Other than just world peace.
[02:10:33.517 --> 02:10:38.798]  Everybody should agree to disagree and go about their ways.
[02:10:39.399 --> 02:10:46.401]  If we're ever going to make it and have the human race survive in any decent extent of the word survive,
[02:10:47.759 --> 02:10:50.022]  We've got to figure out what the hell's going on.
[02:10:50.082 --> 02:10:52.065]  Pardon my French.
[02:10:52.466 --> 02:10:53.447]  I appreciate your call.
[02:10:53.948 --> 02:10:55.170]  We know what's going on.
[02:10:55.230 --> 02:10:56.071]  We're naive.
[02:10:56.132 --> 02:11:02.041]  We've been taught that we're the good guys, and that's a perfect breeding ground like stagnant water for mosquitoes.
[02:11:02.806 --> 02:11:04.967]  And we just bred really evil people.
[02:11:05.387 --> 02:11:09.870]  We were a very prosperous, wealthy nation, so evil people flocked here to hijack control.
[02:11:10.310 --> 02:11:11.190]  They got control.
[02:11:11.250 --> 02:11:13.211]  They've used this as an engine of world empire.
[02:11:13.832 --> 02:11:18.694]  And now they're getting ready to break down the internal country and take all our freedoms, and they're openly saying they are.
[02:11:19.274 --> 02:11:22.996]  And so Celica Stello and myself are here on air going, listen, wake up and get involved.
[02:11:23.236 --> 02:11:26.398]  The caller first said, well, you guys talk about the problems and it just gets worse.
[02:11:27.998 --> 02:11:29.739]  Sir, we're lancing the wound.
[02:11:30.519 --> 02:11:33.120]  Sunshine is the best type of disinfectant.
[02:11:34.100 --> 02:11:34.820]  We're here.
[02:11:35.421 --> 02:11:36.061]  You may know.
[02:11:36.141 --> 02:11:37.341]  You may hear this every day.
[02:11:37.881 --> 02:11:47.364]  The new person driving along, listening on 100.1 in Austin, are great folks, big fans of up there at KCXL in Kansas City.
[02:11:47.424 --> 02:11:50.845]  Pete Chartel and all those wonderful people have been carrying the show for like eight years.
[02:11:53.769 --> 02:11:57.010]  Harry Grothjohn there at WBCR outside Knoxville.
[02:11:57.070 --> 02:11:59.891]  Just all these great people out there who stand with us.
[02:12:00.331 --> 02:12:03.912]  People are listening to those AM and FM stations, and they're hearing this for the first time.
[02:12:03.952 --> 02:12:04.773]  And a lot of them get angry.
[02:12:04.793 --> 02:12:05.373]  They get mad.
[02:12:05.393 --> 02:12:07.774]  It's like Shelley was in denial when he was in the DEA.
[02:12:07.894 --> 02:12:13.575]  It's like I was in denial when I was this little Republican 14 years ago working for the Pat Buchanan campaign.
[02:12:14.096 --> 02:12:18.277]  And I started finding out that the Republicans were just as controlled or more than the Democrats.
[02:12:19.037 --> 02:12:21.418]  We all go through these processes.
[02:12:22.148 --> 02:12:27.530]  Okay, and people hear this show and they get mad, but then a lot of them take the challenge, and they go find out.
[02:12:27.570 --> 02:12:28.291]  We do research.
[02:12:29.131 --> 02:12:30.392]  We have the facts in front of us.
[02:12:30.412 --> 02:12:32.032]  We don't just sit here and make this stuff up.
[02:12:33.393 --> 02:12:35.634]  I'm a good friend of Selly, but the first time I ever met him and interviewed him,
[02:12:36.678 --> 02:12:41.962]  We were on the same page immediately, not because we'd gotten behind closed doors and scripted things like the Bushys and others have to do.
[02:12:42.382 --> 02:12:45.004]  We are just following the truth, so we have the same information.
[02:12:45.504 --> 02:12:53.830]  It's like I interview some JAG officer, or I interview some congressperson who's standing up, or I interview some researcher, and we've never talked before, but we're on the same page.
[02:12:53.850 --> 02:12:55.911]  It's because we're following the facts.
[02:12:57.212 --> 02:12:57.992]  So we've got the truth.
[02:12:58.012 --> 02:12:58.893]  That's a powerful weapon.
[02:12:59.113 --> 02:13:03.336]  The establishment has to keep lying, keep their lies straight, cover up the old lies, sell it.
[02:13:04.022 --> 02:13:04.522]  Absolutely.
[02:13:04.542 --> 02:13:17.951]  You know, the thing about it, since we were very small, we were taught to believe in our country and trust our government and never, you know, just keep on believing in the American dream.
[02:13:18.331 --> 02:13:20.913]  And in reality, it's getting worse.
[02:13:20.973 --> 02:13:21.674]  It's a nightmare.
[02:13:21.814 --> 02:13:23.415]  And in reality...
[02:13:24.324 --> 02:13:29.866]  You know, you talked about McAllen down there in the district attorney, you know, saying you're a terrorist and putting you on some list.
[02:13:29.886 --> 02:13:37.808]  We have these training manuals that say property rights activists, land rights activists, conservatives, liberals, gun owners, we're all being put on terrorist lists.
[02:13:38.408 --> 02:13:47.831]  The people making those lists are the real terrorists, and they think patriotism is licking their boots and not questioning what they say and shutting up and going along with the rape of our families.
[02:13:48.212 --> 02:13:49.112]  They are the traitors.
[02:13:49.172 --> 02:13:52.613]  That's so un-American to claim that dissent is terrorism.
[02:13:53.352 --> 02:13:58.057]  And I think the American people, to be honest with you, they're going to take arms.
[02:13:59.059 --> 02:14:02.162]  And they're going to have... We're going to have a civil war in this country.
[02:14:02.923 --> 02:14:08.269]  We're going to get tired of our kids getting locked up on racial profiling or whatever reason it is, you know.
[02:14:09.261 --> 02:14:19.329]  And, you know, something happens to my kid, I can guarantee you, I'll lock and load one 30-round magazine into my rifle, and I'll go out doing some hunting.
[02:14:19.429 --> 02:14:25.274]  Because, you know, you can mess with me all you want, but, you know, and people say, you know, violence is not the answer, and so forth.
[02:14:25.294 --> 02:14:25.894]  But you know what?
[02:14:26.234 --> 02:14:27.295]  Well, I'll say what the answer is.
[02:14:27.335 --> 02:14:29.317]  Letting them know, don't cross that line.
[02:14:29.437 --> 02:14:29.757]  Exactly.
[02:14:29.777 --> 02:14:30.518]  It's like a rattlesnake.
[02:14:30.538 --> 02:14:31.639]  It's like that flag behind you.
[02:14:31.819 --> 02:14:33.500]  You know, that was the Minutemen flag.
[02:14:33.720 --> 02:14:34.821]  Don't tread on me.
[02:14:34.941 --> 02:14:35.462]  It's saying, hey...
[02:14:36.122 --> 02:14:37.243]  I got a rattle.
[02:14:37.323 --> 02:14:38.064]  I'm letting you know.
[02:14:38.564 --> 02:14:39.445]  Just back off.
[02:14:39.745 --> 02:14:40.766]  And that's what's going to happen.
[02:14:40.826 --> 02:14:43.468]  We're going to have a breaking point in our society.
[02:14:43.709 --> 02:14:44.029]  Just like 1776.
[02:14:44.649 --> 02:14:45.470]  Exactly.
[02:14:45.490 --> 02:14:46.711]  They came to confiscate guns.
[02:14:46.731 --> 02:14:47.892]  They were arresting people's kids.
[02:14:48.092 --> 02:14:49.053]  That's exactly what happened.
[02:14:49.073 --> 02:14:49.674]  They said, that's it.
[02:14:49.794 --> 02:14:50.134]  That's it.
[02:14:50.314 --> 02:14:53.417]  And you draw the line, and you lock and load.
[02:14:53.797 --> 02:14:54.238]  And that's it.
[02:14:54.318 --> 02:14:55.178]  And that's what's going to happen.
[02:14:56.199 --> 02:14:57.841]  People are just going to get fed up.
[02:14:58.441 --> 02:15:00.243]  See, people don't get involved because...
[02:15:01.817 --> 02:15:06.941]  They hear this happening to other people, but once it starts happening to their own people, then they get involved.
[02:15:07.262 --> 02:15:15.709]  And the problem, well, not the problem, the thing that happens is that you get involved, there is a price to pay for it.
[02:15:16.470 --> 02:15:21.675]  You will pay a price for it, whether it's going to jail or... But you'll pay a price if you don't get involved.
[02:15:22.215 --> 02:15:22.636]  It's worse.
[02:15:22.916 --> 02:15:25.238]  Not only will you pay a price, but your kids will pay a price.
[02:15:26.047 --> 02:15:27.268]  So it's got to be done.
[02:15:27.369 --> 02:15:32.534]  And, you know, people say Cesar Chavez, nonviolence, Gandhi, no violence.
[02:15:32.574 --> 02:15:36.379]  But, you know, it's gotten to a point it's never worked.
[02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:39.002]  It's never worked in our country.
[02:15:39.642 --> 02:15:42.045]  So now we need to do what we need to do.
[02:15:42.686 --> 02:15:45.429]  And I'm telling you, people come out and they start...
[02:15:46.232 --> 02:15:50.794]  Taking your freedom away, whether it's the Second Amendment on your weapons or whatever.
[02:15:50.814 --> 02:15:59.998]  And the thing about it, all these people that work, all these ATF agents, DEA agents, FBI agents, it's a different generation of kids.
[02:16:01.018 --> 02:16:04.880]  They actually believe that they have the power to do whatever they want to do.
[02:16:06.062 --> 02:16:06.423]  That's right.
[02:16:06.443 --> 02:16:08.204]  DEA or BATF 30 years ago.
[02:16:08.244 --> 02:16:10.626]  We'll never do what they're doing now.
[02:16:11.107 --> 02:16:12.468]  They're going out there.
[02:16:12.488 --> 02:16:13.769]  They're entrapping people.
[02:16:13.809 --> 02:16:15.110]  They're using informants.
[02:16:15.191 --> 02:16:17.633]  They're not reliable to get a search warrant.
[02:16:17.653 --> 02:16:21.696]  Well, every day some new crime lab that comes out is framing everybody.
[02:16:22.337 --> 02:16:22.717]  Exactly.
[02:16:22.817 --> 02:16:24.099]  On DNA and so forth.
[02:16:24.199 --> 02:16:26.140]  And, you know, it's ballistics and so forth.
[02:16:26.220 --> 02:16:28.402]  And, you know, it's not stopping.
[02:16:28.422 --> 02:16:32.146]  I mean, people think they won't take the Second Amendment.
[02:16:32.946 --> 02:16:35.748]  They just announced there's no Fourth Amendment, and they're going to pass a law.
[02:16:35.788 --> 02:16:40.031]  They can secretly arrest citizens, and we can disappear into rendition black holes.
[02:16:40.051 --> 02:16:43.494]  I mean, that's black bag snatch and grab, folks.
[02:16:44.114 --> 02:16:46.636]  They're openly announcing black bag snatch and grab.
[02:16:46.816 --> 02:16:48.637]  They're openly announcing... Bush has tripled.
[02:16:48.697 --> 02:16:49.438]  I keep saying doubled.
[02:16:49.478 --> 02:16:51.079]  He's now tripled the size of the BATF.
[02:16:51.299 --> 02:16:52.240]  They're not playing games.
[02:16:52.580 --> 02:16:55.062]  Exactly, and that's what happened with Hitler.
[02:16:55.482 --> 02:16:58.024]  You know, he went off there and started grabbing people, and...
[02:16:58.944 --> 02:17:10.311]  That's what they're doing to us now, and they're locking up Americans without any civil rights, any constitutional rights, be able to have an attorney present and so forth.
[02:17:11.032 --> 02:17:13.113]  They can hold you forever and not give you an attorney.
[02:17:14.273 --> 02:17:19.977]  Unfortunately, I think it is going to come to a head, and they're just going to keep pushing and pushing and pushing.
[02:17:21.798 --> 02:17:24.840]  And when it finally breaks, I really feel sorry for the enforcers.
[02:17:25.260 --> 02:17:28.262]  Exactly, because they're going to get a taste of what they've been given.
[02:17:29.960 --> 02:17:32.361]  They dished that out, and we're going to do it again today.
[02:17:33.161 --> 02:17:34.342]  And it's going to be a civil war.
[02:17:35.842 --> 02:17:41.305]  But I mean, I've talked to so many former Special Forces people alone who are just waiting, armed to the teeth.
[02:17:42.285 --> 02:17:44.506]  We've got bunkers, we've got... We'll be right back.
[02:17:45.700 --> 02:17:50.666]  Now you can bring Berkey purification power anywhere with the Sport Berkey filtration bottle.
[02:17:50.987 --> 02:17:53.230]  Ideal for sporting games, camping, or boating.
[02:17:53.290 --> 02:17:56.413]  Or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[02:17:56.454 --> 02:18:00.739]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[02:18:01.079 --> 02:18:04.102]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:18:04.402 --> 02:18:07.845]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[02:18:08.165 --> 02:18:17.533]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:18:17.794 --> 02:18:21.297]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:18:21.537 --> 02:18:28.643]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[02:18:28.883 --> 02:18:30.244]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.

[02:18:47.239 --> 02:18:49.461]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:18:51.934 --> 02:18:56.757]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum, and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:18:56.977 --> 02:18:59.719]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:18:59.759 --> 02:19:00.880]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:19:02.221 --> 02:19:06.803]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:19:07.724 --> 02:19:15.009]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:19:16.009 --> 02:19:19.051]  Midas Resources is offering the red book and silver dollar for only $27.95.

[02:19:37.396 --> 02:19:37.616]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:45.351 --> 02:19:47.777]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:48.338 --> 02:19:54.110]  Did you know that the mother of all secret societies, the Illuminati, worships Lucifer, better known as Satan the Devil?
[02:19:55.100 --> 02:19:55.500]  We're good to go.

[02:21:49.129 --> 02:21:53.333]  I was just talking to Sally during the break about the incredible interview I had with Jesse Ventura.
[02:21:54.794 --> 02:21:56.816]  I've been around other Hollywood stars and people.
[02:21:57.156 --> 02:21:59.678]  I've been up close with Schwarzenegger, and he just looks like a big pansy.
[02:21:59.718 --> 02:22:01.980]  He doesn't put off any of that presence.
[02:22:02.360 --> 02:22:04.742]  But Ventura, man, I was like, this is a killer.
[02:22:05.243 --> 02:22:09.867]  I mean, you could really... He looks completely nuts on top of it.
[02:22:10.968 --> 02:22:13.810]  You got black dreadlocks now?
[02:22:13.830 --> 02:22:14.811]  Oh my goodness.
[02:22:16.097 --> 02:22:16.918]  He crossed the line.
[02:22:17.778 --> 02:22:18.898]  He says he likes Mexico.
[02:22:18.918 --> 02:22:23.100]  Got to have a lot of money to live in Mexico.
[02:22:23.160 --> 02:22:25.101]  Yeah, but he's probably having fun, though.
[02:22:25.141 --> 02:22:26.402]  Yeah.
[02:22:26.622 --> 02:22:28.883]  Okay, let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:22:29.303 --> 02:22:32.745]  Let's talk to Jeff in Kentucky and then Dave, John, Dave, and others.
[02:22:32.785 --> 02:22:33.345]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[02:22:33.885 --> 02:22:34.485]  Hey, sir.
[02:22:34.505 --> 02:22:35.466]  Nice to talk to you again.
[02:22:35.926 --> 02:22:36.346]  Nice talking to you.
[02:22:36.366 --> 02:22:40.528]  You know, I haven't walked in your shoes, but I have traveled your path.
[02:22:41.268 --> 02:22:42.549]  I've taken two oaths in my life.
[02:22:42.669 --> 02:22:44.550]  One was when I enlisted in the Army back in 1998.
[02:22:46.087 --> 02:22:57.315]  And the other one was, I volunteered to be a ranger and recognize a volunteer as a ranger, knowing fully the hazards of my chosen profession, but I did not sign over my soul or my morals.
[02:22:57.975 --> 02:23:00.297]  When I was in Iraq, I was stationed in Panama for a year.
[02:23:00.317 --> 02:23:05.240]  I didn't get to do all the wild stuff that you did down there, but I did get to see a little bit of craziness down there.
[02:23:05.461 --> 02:23:10.664]  And when I was in Iraq, I got to, as a squad leader in an infantry unit, I got to rendition somebody one time.
[02:23:11.645 --> 02:23:14.647]  You see that look in somebody's eyes when they're getting hauled off by the MPs.
[02:23:15.435 --> 02:23:17.956]  So they had you doing secret police type snatching grabs?
[02:23:38.371 --> 02:23:42.594]  If their IDs, and we couldn't speak Arabic, so we didn't know if their IDs matched or not.
[02:23:42.654 --> 02:23:52.941]  So we looked at the people and was like, well, that guy doesn't look right, so we pick him up, take him over to the MPs, and the MPs would be like... Yeah, that's what the Army's own report said, 75 to 90 percent totally innocent of anything.
[02:23:53.601 --> 02:23:56.023]  And when that... We got fortunate first.
[02:23:57.124 --> 02:23:58.905]  I had one kid that was a college student.
[02:23:58.925 --> 02:24:04.689]  He looked me in the eye, and when he was getting hauled off, it just looked like, you know, if I ever see you again on the street, son...
[02:24:05.307 --> 02:24:06.928]  That's what his look in the eye was to me.
[02:24:06.988 --> 02:24:11.672]  If I ever see you on the streets again, son, it's my blood and your blood, you know?
[02:24:12.913 --> 02:24:21.819]  And when I came back to America, I got turned by my college professor and got to see some things that was going on, especially with 9-11.
[02:24:22.840 --> 02:24:25.282]  It's the true soldiers that went in the military.
[02:24:25.322 --> 02:24:30.506]  Not the soldiers that are in there now, because the soldiers that are in there now are just a bunch of gangster punk kids.
[02:24:31.499 --> 02:24:35.003]  You know, working for the New World Order, but the soldiers that were in there... Shelly's nodding his head.
[02:24:35.023 --> 02:24:36.024]  You want to comment on that, Shelly?
[02:24:36.505 --> 02:24:38.447]  Yeah, basically, that's what happened, Silas.
[02:24:38.507 --> 02:24:46.696]  I keep saying it's a new generation of soldiers, a new generation of kids that go out and they think by...
[02:24:48.118 --> 02:24:48.478]  We're good to go.
[02:24:48.498 --> 02:24:48.658]  I think?
[02:25:07.575 --> 02:25:14.061]  So, one out of three that saw combat in any war is going to be suffering from PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder.
[02:25:14.622 --> 02:25:21.468]  And they will be out killing their families, they'll be out killing, and a lot of them, a majority of them, 75% of them will go into law enforcement.
[02:25:22.029 --> 02:25:23.290]  And that's what's happening now.
[02:25:23.510 --> 02:25:31.578]  And that's why you get people, I mean, they just had that footage of the little 8-year-old black girl, for no reason, the cops saying, I'm going to blow her head off, and the other cops have to come and say, put your gun down.
[02:25:32.461 --> 02:25:35.062]  I mean, why do you put a gun to an old kid's head?
[02:25:35.682 --> 02:25:40.985]  Well, because they're waiting to, you know, to... Snap.
[02:25:41.265 --> 02:25:41.685]  Snap.
[02:25:42.065 --> 02:25:43.186]  And they've snapped already.
[02:25:43.226 --> 02:25:46.927]  They just don't realize they have any little opportunity.
[02:25:47.007 --> 02:25:55.411]  And what happened to us Vietnam veterans that came into law enforcement, we had this guilt trip that we were still looking for that bullet that we missed in Vietnam.
[02:25:55.991 --> 02:25:58.472]  And the majority of us went into law enforcement.
[02:25:59.111 --> 02:26:03.874]  And I remember coming back from several operations in South America.
[02:26:04.814 --> 02:26:09.977]  Coming back and we're going on a raid and you know, I'm strapped for bear, man.
[02:26:10.637 --> 02:26:17.121]  My camel flushed my face and I got my knives, I got my guns and I got... And people says, what are you doing?
[02:26:17.141 --> 02:26:19.142]  I says, well, we're going on a raid.
[02:26:19.162 --> 02:26:21.223]  He says, you don't need all that stuff to go on a raid.
[02:26:21.904 --> 02:26:27.747]  But see, the instinct survival, the thing about when you suffer from PTSD, it's with you for the rest of your life.
[02:26:28.530 --> 02:26:35.933]  I go to VA on a daily, or not daily basis, but on a monthly basis, and I've got Vietnam vets telling me that PTSD will never go away.
[02:26:35.953 --> 02:26:37.373]  It'll never go away.
[02:26:37.633 --> 02:26:39.554]  And people say, why do you live in the past?
[02:26:39.634 --> 02:26:41.415]  Because it's in our bones now.
[02:26:41.435 --> 02:26:42.415]  It's like 15 seconds ago.
[02:26:42.435 --> 02:26:44.196]  That war is like 15 seconds ago for you.
[02:26:44.476 --> 02:26:44.916]  Exactly.
[02:26:44.956 --> 02:26:45.716]  And it's in our blood.
[02:26:45.897 --> 02:26:46.777]  It's never going to win.
[02:26:46.817 --> 02:26:49.738]  That's what the spouses are not going to be able to understand.
[02:26:50.198 --> 02:26:51.599]  The fathers, the mothers.
[02:26:52.899 --> 02:26:55.280]  I knew it because I saw it in my dad.
[02:26:55.320 --> 02:26:57.601]  My dad was shot six times in the Philippines.
[02:26:58.161 --> 02:27:00.362]  And he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.
[02:27:00.862 --> 02:27:02.362]  And we couldn't understand what it was.
[02:27:02.922 --> 02:27:05.603]  And then I grew on to it and I became just like him.
[02:27:06.343 --> 02:27:07.363]  So, it does happen.
[02:27:07.604 --> 02:27:09.244]  And listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:27:09.284 --> 02:27:09.904]  Interesting story.
[02:27:09.944 --> 02:27:10.804]  Call us again sometime.
[02:27:10.824 --> 02:27:11.765]  Tell us more about Iraq.
[02:27:12.445 --> 02:27:14.986]  We'll talk to Dave, John, and Dave, and many others.
[02:27:15.006 --> 02:27:15.066]  1-800-259-9000.
[02:27:17.176 --> 02:27:17.676]  92-31.
[02:27:17.716 --> 02:27:19.959]  Sully Costello is our guest.
[02:27:19.999 --> 02:27:20.939]  The book is Powder Burns.
[02:27:20.979 --> 02:27:26.184]  It's in our online video and bookstore shopping cart at infowars.com.
[02:27:26.204 --> 02:27:27.265]  That's infowars.com.

[02:27:35.753 --> 02:27:36.634]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.114 --> 02:27:38.715]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.656 --> 02:27:42.339]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:27:48.561 --> 02:27:50.922]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[02:27:51.002 --> 02:27:58.086]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote-unquote.
[02:27:58.666 --> 02:28:00.968]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:28:01.608 --> 02:28:05.150]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:28:05.710 --> 02:28:09.833]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:28:10.413 --> 02:28:13.355]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:28:14.358 --> 02:28:17.280]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?

[02:29:35.166 --> 02:29:35.507]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:29:35.527 --> 02:29:37.288]  Or order online at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:29:46.707 --> 02:29:50.850]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:29:51.070 --> 02:29:52.831]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:29:53.091 --> 02:29:59.375]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:29:59.676 --> 02:30:05.800]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:30:06.040 --> 02:30:12.064]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:12.344 --> 02:30:13.084]  We're good to go.
[02:30:13.104 --> 02:30:13.884]  We're good to go.
[02:30:30.589 --> 02:30:31.190]  We're good to go.
[02:30:58.977 --> 02:31:00.618]  There's too much confusion.
[02:31:00.758 --> 02:31:02.059]  I can't get relief.
[02:31:02.139 --> 02:31:09.684]  I like the line in this song where it says there are many here among us.
[02:31:22.515 --> 02:31:26.998]  Who believe that life is but a joke, but you and I, we've been through that.
[02:31:28.619 --> 02:31:29.759]  You've got one life to live.
[02:31:29.799 --> 02:31:30.980]  You should do the right thing.
[02:31:31.440 --> 02:31:33.402]  You should stand up against evil and corruption.
[02:31:33.962 --> 02:31:35.523]  And people go, oh, that's so good.
[02:31:35.563 --> 02:31:38.064]  Oh, you're such a hero, Sally Castillo or Alex Jones.
[02:31:38.104 --> 02:31:38.865]  Thank you for fighting them.
[02:31:39.881 --> 02:31:41.601]  I don't ever think I even really had a choice.
[02:31:41.621 --> 02:31:57.764]  I mean, you finally got a bunch of sicko killers that like to torture innocent people and ship heroin and cocaine into our country and then put our kids in prison and do all of this and they're putting up cameras everywhere and they're taking our... I mean, how... Shelly, I mean, is it instinctive for you to fight this?
[02:31:57.864 --> 02:31:59.564]  I mean, you're just doing what you're like a fish.
[02:31:59.604 --> 02:32:00.445]  You're swimming in water.
[02:32:00.465 --> 02:32:02.425]  Everybody says it's a hero for swimming.
[02:32:02.985 --> 02:32:03.725]  Absolutely not.
[02:32:03.785 --> 02:32:05.365]  And it's got nothing to do with me.
[02:32:05.465 --> 02:32:07.406]  It's about my kids and about my grandkids.
[02:32:07.446 --> 02:32:08.626]  That's what it's going to be all about.
[02:32:08.806 --> 02:32:08.906]  And...
[02:32:09.485 --> 02:32:13.788]  You know, I didn't start talking about this when I left the agency.
[02:32:13.908 --> 02:32:18.091]  I started talking and writing reports during when I was an agent.
[02:32:18.131 --> 02:32:22.594]  And that was the difference between myself and other people now that are coming forward to talk.
[02:32:23.015 --> 02:32:29.639]  I was never scared to talk about it and educate the people about what happened.
[02:32:31.216 --> 02:32:37.458]  You know, it's so sad that because the people you report this are not going to take it forward, and they'll go in what was known as the black hole.
[02:32:37.898 --> 02:32:39.458]  Why do you think they killed Gary Webb?
[02:32:40.098 --> 02:32:46.400]  Well, I think it came to a point with Gary, my opinion is the fact that, you know, you can't shoot yourself twice in the head.
[02:32:46.460 --> 02:32:48.401]  I mean, I really don't care who says what.
[02:32:48.861 --> 02:32:54.062]  But Gary, you know, I saw it in Central America and I saw it in South America.
[02:32:54.702 --> 02:32:55.563]  There's a choice.
[02:32:57.163 --> 02:33:00.186]  Either you take yourself out or they'll take your family out for you.
[02:33:00.226 --> 02:33:02.048]  It's either you do it or we do it for you.
[02:33:02.969 --> 02:33:06.392]  And I think Gary knew that he had to do what he had to do.
[02:33:06.612 --> 02:33:09.575]  And yeah, he left messages.
[02:33:09.615 --> 02:33:12.178]  He left suicide notes or whatever.
[02:33:12.738 --> 02:33:14.040]  But that was part of the whole thing.
[02:33:14.500 --> 02:33:16.963]  And, you know, he's not the only one it's happened to.
[02:33:17.003 --> 02:33:18.124]  It's happened to other people.
[02:33:18.644 --> 02:33:21.646]  Well, I mean, from the famous reports, there's hundreds of them that have been documented.
[02:33:21.686 --> 02:33:26.029]  They just, you walk in, it's dark, they go, hey, hands up, sit down over here.
[02:33:26.049 --> 02:33:28.611]  They tie you up and they say, listen, we're going to let you go.
[02:33:28.631 --> 02:33:29.572]  We want you to write a note.
[02:33:29.992 --> 02:33:31.553]  And if you don't, we're going to kill your whole family.
[02:33:32.674 --> 02:33:33.134]  Exactly.
[02:33:33.194 --> 02:33:34.655]  And that happens all the time.
[02:33:34.715 --> 02:33:40.980]  Right now, the Septas came into Texas and they found out that there were
[02:33:41.600 --> 02:33:42.101]  We're good to go.
[02:33:42.121 --> 02:33:42.341]  I think?
[02:33:58.940 --> 02:34:01.281]  Tell folks who Los Santos is for those that don't know.
[02:34:01.481 --> 02:34:15.163]  Los Santos are all military individuals that work for different governments who are now hired by the cartels to be the enforcers of their operations and so forth and training.
[02:34:16.063 --> 02:34:17.344]  They train here in South Texas.
[02:34:17.384 --> 02:34:18.404]  They train in Mexico.
[02:34:18.424 --> 02:34:24.245]  They've got Israelis working for them, training them on both sides of the border.
[02:34:25.809 --> 02:34:26.129]  It's huge.
[02:34:26.430 --> 02:34:28.351]  Our good friends, the Israelis, as usual.
[02:34:28.371 --> 02:34:29.772]  They've always been there.
[02:34:29.812 --> 02:34:34.616]  They're there now, right now, helping out, training those people and so forth.
[02:34:34.656 --> 02:34:38.999]  They're using our military, former military guys, to train them.
[02:34:39.619 --> 02:34:43.883]  I, myself, have been offered to have a million dollars to go down there and train the Zetas.
[02:34:44.950 --> 02:34:46.791]  And there's no way in the world I would ever do that.
[02:34:47.031 --> 02:34:55.373]  And, you know, it's just, I'm fighting the so-called war on drugs, and they're just people that feel they have the power to do anything in this world.
[02:34:56.014 --> 02:34:56.734]  And they're done.
[02:34:56.814 --> 02:34:58.855]  And in South Texas, the drug dealers are God.
[02:34:59.175 --> 02:35:02.856]  Well, they walk on water, and basically they're very well protected.
[02:35:02.896 --> 02:35:04.717]  They've got people on their payroll from the U.S.
[02:35:04.777 --> 02:35:10.598]  Attorney's Office to FBI agents to DEA agents who tells them when the next
[02:35:12.359 --> 02:35:13.480]  We're good to go.
[02:35:13.600 --> 02:35:14.960]  We're good to go.
[02:35:30.688 --> 02:35:37.692]  Well, that's what the globalists, that's what Bush, Dick Cheney told the Taliban, either a carpet of gold or a carpet of bombs.
[02:35:38.032 --> 02:35:38.452]  Exactly.
[02:35:38.712 --> 02:35:39.653]  And that's what happened.
[02:35:39.713 --> 02:35:42.254]  And the Taliban is back in power now in Afghanistan.
[02:35:42.834 --> 02:35:44.936]  And we're losing Afghanistan as we speak now.
[02:35:47.421 --> 02:35:52.145]  Going back to the drug trade, we've got more drugs coming out of Afghanistan.
[02:35:52.265 --> 02:35:57.949]  The biggest crop cultivated ever in the heroin coming out of Afghanistan.
[02:35:57.969 --> 02:35:58.930]  Well, I mean, there's no doubt.
[02:35:59.050 --> 02:36:00.031]  But I want it in your words.
[02:36:00.091 --> 02:36:07.257]  But from all the research I've done and all the agents that have gone public, the majority of the narcotics that come in are really licensed or certified.
[02:36:07.297 --> 02:36:10.019]  That is, cartels have to pay their cut longer through certain banks.
[02:36:10.603 --> 02:36:11.164]  We're good to go.
[02:36:21.838 --> 02:36:22.579]  We're good to go.
[02:36:43.099 --> 02:36:49.285]  And so literally the drug dealers are our government and they own the prisons and then make money on both ends of it.
[02:36:49.906 --> 02:36:57.113]  And so I guess the way to end this is to force decriminalization, which the government will never allow because they're dealing the drugs.
[02:36:57.853 --> 02:36:58.514]  Absolutely right.
[02:36:59.014 --> 02:37:01.036]  People say, well, you know, marijuana never hurt anybody.
[02:37:01.116 --> 02:37:06.221]  And, you know, if you were to take marijuana off the streets tomorrow, then what would people do?
[02:37:06.241 --> 02:37:07.703]  They're going to go buy a beer.
[02:37:08.443 --> 02:37:20.447]  And if you were to legalize marijuana, the corporate America on the liquor and beer are not going to allow that because instead of buying a $3 beer, you'll buy a $0.50 joint and light up and get high.
[02:37:20.947 --> 02:37:22.167]  And they're not going to tolerate that.
[02:37:22.307 --> 02:37:27.009]  And it's, you know, America has gotten now more addicted to drug money than they are to drugs.
[02:37:27.089 --> 02:37:31.930]  Well, I mean, we have more, triple the heroin, double the cocaine we had just 12 years ago.
[02:37:31.950 --> 02:37:36.432]  We have gone from $1 million in prison to over $7 million in the system, $4 million behind bars.
[02:37:37.613 --> 02:37:40.338]  I mean, it's designed to destroy the country.
[02:37:40.798 --> 02:37:41.239]  Exactly.
[02:37:41.439 --> 02:37:42.702]  And that's what's going to happen.
[02:37:42.762 --> 02:37:49.132]  It's going to continue to do... You've got to remember, we spend billions of dollars in source countries like Colombia and Peru, and we can't make a dent.
[02:37:50.149 --> 02:37:52.191]  It's got to tell you that there's something wrong with this picture.
[02:37:52.231 --> 02:37:54.392]  This is not working, and it's never going to work.
[02:37:54.432 --> 02:37:56.834]  That's why I've always said there's never been a war on drugs in the world.
[02:37:56.874 --> 02:38:01.517]  It's not working from a normal person's view, but for the government and the drug dealers, this is great.
[02:38:01.657 --> 02:38:06.981]  It's all about money, and they don't care if it hurts your grandkids or your fifth graders or whatever.
[02:38:07.521 --> 02:38:13.383]  Well, the truth is, if you decriminalized it, then there wouldn't even be a conduit to bring it in because there wouldn't be money.
[02:38:14.023 --> 02:38:19.165]  If you just regulated it and made it legal, that would take it out of the black market and then make it all transparent.
[02:38:19.425 --> 02:38:19.885]  Exactly.
[02:38:20.005 --> 02:38:21.526]  And so that's not going to happen.
[02:38:21.786 --> 02:38:24.427]  You've got to remember, we've got the best intelligence network in the world.
[02:38:24.907 --> 02:38:34.333]  We can find out by satellite photos where every cocaine lab there is in the Amazon, and we could take them out with any kind of missiles or whatever.
[02:38:34.713 --> 02:38:38.495]  But we're not going to do that because it's a big production of coca that we need.
[02:38:38.675 --> 02:38:51.243]  In fact, the only stuff that gets... I've seen the satellite maps that's come out in investigative reports where they show satellite maps of where they're supposed to spray, where they're supposed to raid, and it's the exact line, okay, that you spray all the commies' fields, but all of our fields you leave alone.
[02:38:51.543 --> 02:38:51.963]  Exactly.
[02:38:52.064 --> 02:38:57.308]  And that's happening in Colombia with the paramilitary and the guerrilla networks up there.
[02:38:58.248 --> 02:39:01.211]  You know, they always blame the guerrillas for being involved in drug trafficking.
[02:39:01.231 --> 02:39:08.336]  But really, it's like our government's Coke and the communists are Pepsi, and Coke is literally coming in spraying Pepsi's fields.
[02:39:08.756 --> 02:39:09.157]  Exactly.
[02:39:09.457 --> 02:39:11.378]  And, you know, it's all part of the U.S.
[02:39:11.398 --> 02:39:11.779]  government.
[02:39:11.839 --> 02:39:17.183]  It's all a bogus, phony war on drugs.
[02:39:17.657 --> 02:39:18.498]  But they love it.
[02:39:18.538 --> 02:39:22.840]  They love to catch your teenager with some ecstasy shipped in from Israel or Europe.
[02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:24.981]  They love to catch him with some cocaine.
[02:39:25.341 --> 02:39:26.562]  Young people, it's not rebellious.
[02:39:26.622 --> 02:39:27.263]  It's not cool.
[02:39:27.323 --> 02:39:27.843]  Don't use it.
[02:39:28.163 --> 02:39:29.804]  Don't use George Bush's products.
[02:39:30.124 --> 02:39:32.666]  You want to hurt these people, be straight, be strong.
[02:39:33.486 --> 02:39:35.267]  But please don't use their products.
[02:39:35.307 --> 02:39:40.310]  But the sick thing is, you use their products, then they put you in their presence for using their products.
[02:39:40.510 --> 02:39:40.851]  That's right.
[02:39:40.871 --> 02:39:43.033]  You become a prostitute to them, and that's it.
[02:39:43.133 --> 02:39:44.835]  Well, this is how they legalize slavery again.
[02:39:45.135 --> 02:39:47.998]  They bring something in, put it out everywhere, hype it with Hollywood.
[02:39:48.419 --> 02:39:51.102]  The young people use it, and that's their excuse to make you a slave.
[02:39:51.282 --> 02:39:56.728]  That's what happened in South Central with the blacks back in the 80s when the CIA brought in all these...
[02:39:57.288 --> 02:39:58.468]  We're good to go.
[02:39:58.488 --> 02:39:58.628]  I think?
[02:40:23.321 --> 02:40:24.662]  So please get there, folks.
[02:40:24.702 --> 02:40:26.163]  Get there early to get good seats.
[02:40:26.664 --> 02:40:30.566]  I wish I could go, but I haven't seen my family in days as usual, so I need to get home.
[02:40:31.327 --> 02:40:33.608]  But Kevin Smith is going to be down there tonight videotaping.
[02:40:34.088 --> 02:40:35.429]  Rob Jacobson is going to be down there videotaping.
[02:40:35.469 --> 02:40:36.690]  We're going to put this on the web.
[02:40:37.091 --> 02:40:45.996]  CIA, drug running, Oliver North, torture, Negroponte, death squads, Reagan Bush Sr., Texas Union tonight.
[02:40:46.517 --> 02:40:51.220]  Are you going to be there at Brave New Books beforehand or after?
[02:40:52.172 --> 02:40:53.193]  Probably it's going to be after.
[02:40:53.213 --> 02:40:54.813]  We're going to have a book signing at the store.
[02:40:55.353 --> 02:40:57.494]  Probably about 9 o'clock or something?
[02:40:57.514 --> 02:40:57.774]  Yeah, 9.30.
[02:40:58.455 --> 02:41:01.076]  And it's very close to the event.
[02:41:01.336 --> 02:41:01.656]  Sure.
[02:41:01.816 --> 02:41:02.196]  Okay.
[02:41:02.236 --> 02:41:04.677]  Well, certainly, folks, you should go to that.
[02:41:04.757 --> 02:41:06.458]  Shelly's going to have a slide show.
[02:41:06.478 --> 02:41:12.520]  We're going to videotape it, if that's all right, and try to put it out on local TV so folks can see it and also get the crowd's questions.
[02:41:12.820 --> 02:41:13.761]  Okay, let's go to the calls.
[02:41:13.801 --> 02:41:16.122]  Dave in Ohio, then John, Dave, Bill, Clay, and others.
[02:41:16.142 --> 02:41:16.742]  Go ahead, Dave.
[02:41:16.762 --> 02:41:18.603]  How are you doing, Alex, today?
[02:41:18.883 --> 02:41:19.183]  Good, sir.
[02:41:19.867 --> 02:41:22.189]  Hey, I just want to thank you for what you're doing.
[02:41:23.090 --> 02:41:29.695]  I'm essentially a first-time caller, but I have listened to your program probably essentially every day for the last couple of months.
[02:41:29.775 --> 02:41:34.298]  I want to let you know that I'm on board, and I think that 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:41:35.039 --> 02:41:42.405]  We have a small group of people here in Ohio, in the southwest section of Ohio, and we're trying to get the word out.
[02:41:42.465 --> 02:41:47.028]  We're trying to get people to just understand what the New World Order is all about and what they're doing.
[02:41:48.328 --> 02:42:03.977]  When you talked to Mr. Chavez earlier today, I guess my question would be, and you're still trying to verify parts of the story just to make sure that everything is on the up and up, but my question would be... Well, we know the criticism of him has not been legitimate, is my point.
[02:42:04.017 --> 02:42:04.898]  He was in the military.
[02:42:04.938 --> 02:42:05.899]  He was where he said he was.
[02:42:05.919 --> 02:42:06.779]  This is what he saw.
[02:42:07.179 --> 02:42:09.161]  He wrote a letter to the editor, and it started all of this.
[02:42:09.601 --> 02:42:10.021]  Right.
[02:42:10.401 --> 02:42:14.224]  And I guess my thing is, we're in Ohio, and he's in Ohio, and I was wondering...
[02:42:14.964 --> 02:42:21.790]  I'm willing to leave my email address to you guys in the event that maybe he can... Sir, his phone number, he put his phone number out publicly.
[02:42:21.970 --> 02:42:24.912]  Just type in Sergeant Chavez, Testimony 911.
[02:42:25.573 --> 02:42:26.754]  You'll find his letter to the editor.
[02:42:26.774 --> 02:42:27.334]  You can call him.
[02:42:28.495 --> 02:42:32.758]  Okay, because the little group that we have, we want to get the word out as much as possible.
[02:42:33.019 --> 02:42:35.981]  Sure, but I'm just saying, go online, you can get his phone number.
[02:42:36.361 --> 02:42:36.802]  Okay.
[02:42:36.862 --> 02:42:38.463]  And I think you ought to contact him.
[02:42:39.211 --> 02:42:42.677]  We're just trying to fight this thing and get the word out to as many people as we possibly can.
[02:42:42.918 --> 02:42:43.659]  Well, good, sir.
[02:42:43.899 --> 02:42:44.320]  Keep it up.
[02:42:44.480 --> 02:42:52.354]  I know we've got several great affiliates in Ohio and a really exploding audience there, so tell everybody about the show, and I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:42:54.524 --> 02:42:57.207]  I know you were in the green room earlier back there.
[02:42:57.467 --> 02:43:01.812]  Shola Costello, what did you think of the interview with Mr. Chavez we had on?
[02:43:02.593 --> 02:43:03.775]  It's great, great.
[02:43:03.795 --> 02:43:10.302]  He emphasized that he has no documents, but the fact that he was there, he was present, and that means a lot.
[02:43:10.402 --> 02:43:12.024]  It's nothing like having a night witness to...
[02:43:12.685 --> 02:43:12.885]  Exactly.
[02:43:12.925 --> 02:43:15.948]  And you know, why should they retaliate against him for telling the truth?
[02:43:15.968 --> 02:43:17.409]  Let's go ahead and take a call.
[02:43:17.429 --> 02:43:17.949]  John in Ohio.
[02:43:17.989 --> 02:43:18.650]  Another call from Ohio.
[02:43:18.670 --> 02:43:19.050]  You're on the air.
[02:43:19.090 --> 02:43:19.270]  Welcome.
[02:43:41.109 --> 02:43:42.970]  Yes, I think the media is the real problem.
[02:43:43.190 --> 02:43:44.451]  The media is the real problem here.
[02:43:44.491 --> 02:44:02.841]  I think as long as people rely on the media, and I think somebody in the CIA once said, more important than all the armies, more important than all the bullets, are the disinformation that we can... Yeah, the Pentagon has said recently that Infowars, psychological operations, is 90% of their strategy.
[02:44:03.262 --> 02:44:08.705]  Yeah, and I listen to you, and I listen to what I can see, some honest people on the left, like Workers' Organ, WSWS.org,
[02:44:09.875 --> 02:44:24.639]  And you won't hear anything about this Luis Posada saga, this mass murderer, this airline bomber, this assassin, this man who planned to blow up Panama University to kill Castro because he was speaking there.
[02:44:24.659 --> 02:44:25.399]  He was convicted.
[02:44:25.419 --> 02:44:26.860]  He was brought to this country.
[02:44:26.880 --> 02:44:28.900]  He's now being in the process of being freed.
[02:44:29.401 --> 02:44:34.522]  And that process began on the very day that Bush was saying, we will not tolerate any country that harbors terrorists.
[02:44:34.972 --> 02:44:49.638]  In his effort to try to justify this phony war on terrorism, the media completely has been blacking information along these lines out because it would show totally how phony this war on drugs, war on terrorism is while we're
[02:44:50.129 --> 02:44:52.751]  Supporting terrorists as heroes in this country.
[02:44:52.771 --> 02:44:56.033]  The war on drugs, the war on terror, it's all the war on our freedoms.
[02:44:56.893 --> 02:44:58.995]  They control the drugs, they control the terror.
[02:44:59.035 --> 02:45:02.817]  These are the catalysts to introduce us into slavery in the name of keeping us safe.
[02:45:03.497 --> 02:45:17.326]  And why aren't we told, for instance, that people like Orlando Bosch and Luis Posada are treated as heroes in this country, being harbored after being trained by the CIA to perpetrate 45 years of terrorism against Cuba,
[02:45:18.416 --> 02:45:21.238]  I think it was about eight years ago, all the media was down in Cuba.
[02:45:21.258 --> 02:45:25.340]  They had people from around the world, jurists and others, the victims of U.S.
[02:45:25.380 --> 02:45:37.327]  terrorism there, and not a word of it was mentioned by the media because, again, this would blow the whole paradigm of pretense of the Bush administration that were fighting terrorism around the world when, in fact, we're supporting it.
[02:45:37.847 --> 02:45:43.370]  And the people that are trying to prevent that are now in prison in this country, some Cubans,
[02:45:43.911 --> 02:45:47.913]  We've tried to infiltrate some of these CIA-connected terrorist groups in Miami.
[02:45:48.453 --> 02:45:54.156]  They went in good faith to the FBI, along with the Cuban government, to give them this information, I think naively.
[02:45:54.476 --> 02:45:58.799]  And instead of them going after these terrorists, predictably, they were arrested.
[02:45:59.239 --> 02:46:01.220]  Let me get a comment from Sally on what you've said.
[02:46:01.460 --> 02:46:06.583]  Yeah, those are known as the Cuban Fives that have been arrested and detained here in the U.S.
[02:46:06.623 --> 02:46:07.363]  and being charged with
[02:46:08.064 --> 02:46:11.187]  Well, I mean, listen, I support the Cuban community.
[02:46:11.207 --> 02:46:13.189]  I don't support Fidel Castro.
[02:46:13.209 --> 02:46:17.292]  But at the same time, they're just as evil or worse because, you know, they claim they can do anything to fight Castro.
[02:46:33.847 --> 02:46:41.611]  And, you know, the Miami Herald has a Spanish version, found out five of its employees were on secret payroll and were CIA.
[02:46:41.991 --> 02:46:42.951]  Well, that's illegal.
[02:46:43.011 --> 02:46:48.314]  You know, Bush has spent $1.6 billion on fake news, so they fire him and the Cubans go absolutely crazy.
[02:46:48.714 --> 02:46:54.997]  They start protesting and pulling their subscriptions when all the Miami Herald's doing is what it's supposed to.
[02:46:55.017 --> 02:46:57.738]  You're not supposed to have secret government agents write news articles.
[02:46:58.198 --> 02:46:58.479]  Selling?
[02:46:58.939 --> 02:47:00.260]  Exactly, and being paid for it.
[02:47:00.361 --> 02:47:04.445]  You know, they were getting paid pretty good money for reporting.
[02:47:04.525 --> 02:47:06.007]  It's like Armstrong-Williams line.
[02:47:06.027 --> 02:47:09.190]  I mean, they've got thousands of reporters on the payroll, folks.
[02:47:09.951 --> 02:47:16.979]  And, I mean, that's the kind of stuff, you know, Cuba does, where they have these government reporters, but at least in Cuba they admit they're government reporters.
[02:47:19.145 --> 02:47:19.546]  Exactly.
[02:47:19.566 --> 02:47:20.747]  In Venezuela, the same thing.
[02:47:22.448 --> 02:47:25.250]  Whatever Chavez is doing, we're doing it worst.
[02:47:25.491 --> 02:47:26.031]  Well, I know this.
[02:47:26.111 --> 02:47:28.173]  I've talked to people who have been down there, and I've seen the reports.
[02:47:28.633 --> 02:47:29.915]  Chavez walks right into a place.
[02:47:29.935 --> 02:47:31.396]  They don't search anybody they let in there.
[02:47:32.225 --> 02:47:37.768]  He'll speak to thousands of people, just like Saddam would get up in front of 500, 2,000 people with machine guns.
[02:47:38.208 --> 02:47:40.589]  But Bush, they shut down half of New York when he goes there.
[02:47:40.609 --> 02:47:42.330]  And I'm not defending Saddam Hussein.
[02:47:42.350 --> 02:47:43.531]  He was a government agent of the U.S.
[02:47:43.551 --> 02:47:51.955]  The point is, how can Chavez go on TV every week and take unscreened phone calls and then go into rooms without people being searched?
[02:47:52.435 --> 02:47:53.796]  And how can Saddam do it?
[02:47:53.836 --> 02:47:57.478]  But then in our country, the president's guarded like he's a Roman emperor.
[02:47:57.538 --> 02:47:57.778]  John?
[02:48:00.192 --> 02:48:12.156]  And why haven't we heard that these people that are being harbored here, these terrorists, Orlando Bosch and Posada, have perpetrated terrorism right in Washington, one of the worst acts of terrorism.
[02:48:12.196 --> 02:48:14.817]  This is the 30th anniversary of blowing up a car bomb.
[02:48:15.097 --> 02:48:18.918]  By car bomb, the foreign minister of Chile was overthrown by the CIA.
[02:48:19.238 --> 02:48:26.140]  And these people are treated as heroes in this country, actually perpetrating airline bombings and terrorism against Americans.
[02:48:28.199 --> 02:48:29.219]  I know.
[02:48:29.279 --> 02:48:30.400]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:48:30.420 --> 02:48:32.221]  We'll come back and talk to Dave, Bill, and Clay.
[02:48:32.241 --> 02:48:33.321]  That'll be it for calls.
[02:48:33.681 --> 02:48:37.663]  I'll also briefly give you the telephone number and website to get my new film, Terror Storm.
[02:48:37.683 --> 02:48:41.845]  It's available on DVD with 68 minutes of extras.
[02:48:42.105 --> 02:48:42.846]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:42.866 --> 02:48:43.326]  Stay with us.
[02:48:48.738 --> 02:48:51.921]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:52.281 --> 02:48:54.223]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:54.583 --> 02:49:02.249]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.930 --> 02:49:09.975]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.375 --> 02:49:13.318]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:49:13.658 --> 02:49:16.020]  The White House probing to disseminate fake news.
[02:49:16.440 --> 02:49:17.261]  NSA spies.

[02:50:07.414 --> 02:50:13.919]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:50:14.099 --> 02:50:19.183]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:50:19.303 --> 02:50:28.171]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:50:28.451 --> 02:50:31.733]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[02:51:47.845 --> 02:51:53.870]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:51:54.471 --> 02:51:57.474]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:57.854 --> 02:52:00.997]  Final segment, my friends, on this live Tuesday edition.
[02:52:02.142 --> 02:52:02.462]  We're good to go.
[02:52:26.156 --> 02:52:26.816]  We're good to go.
[02:52:26.856 --> 02:52:26.996]  I think?
[02:52:49.501 --> 02:52:51.283]  It really is an important book to have.
[02:52:51.343 --> 02:52:56.488]  Powder Burns, Drug Trafficking Documented from the Eyes of a DEA Agent.
[02:52:56.508 --> 02:52:59.471]  We have that available at Infowars.com as well.
[02:52:59.792 --> 02:53:01.293]  Let's take quickly three final calls.
[02:53:01.313 --> 02:53:02.614]  I want to get you all on board here.
[02:53:02.995 --> 02:53:04.636]  Dave in California, then Bill and Clay.
[02:53:04.676 --> 02:53:05.257]  Dave, go ahead.
[02:53:05.477 --> 02:53:06.158]  Good morning, Alex.
[02:53:06.178 --> 02:53:09.421]  It's always a pleasure and inspiration to speak to you and your guests.
[02:53:09.601 --> 02:53:09.882]  Thank you.
[02:53:09.902 --> 02:53:10.442]  What's on your mind?
[02:53:10.843 --> 02:53:11.944]  Sally, it's an honor to speak to you.
[02:53:11.964 --> 02:53:13.025]  I want to cut to the chase here.
[02:53:13.405 --> 02:53:14.625]  George Herbert Walker Bush.
[02:53:15.026 --> 02:53:35.892]  We know Prescott Bush was a big Nazi, and George I and Prescott were probably involved in bringing Nazi war criminals in after World War II, and then in 1947 the NSA Act goes in authorizing presidential covert activity, and boom, boom, boom, CIA, Northwoods, Bay of Pigs, JFK, North Africa, Iraq, Iran-Contra, El Salvador, death squads, torture, you name it.
[02:53:37.244 --> 02:53:39.146]  You know, nukes, bioweapons, crack, and 9-11.
[02:53:39.606 --> 02:53:42.468]  And now they're using terror to turn us into Nazi Germany.
[02:53:42.528 --> 02:53:42.988]  There you go.
[02:53:43.008 --> 02:53:47.251]  So I was just wondering, I'll tell you, what's your short take on George Herbert Walker Bush?
[02:53:48.011 --> 02:53:49.172]  He's an evil person.
[02:53:50.053 --> 02:53:51.774]  I'll do what Uwe Chavez said.
[02:53:51.814 --> 02:53:52.574]  He's the devil.
[02:53:53.055 --> 02:53:55.256]  And, you know, he stinks.
[02:53:55.416 --> 02:54:01.180]  And, you know, the day he dies is when people are going to say the person that should have never been born.
[02:54:01.934 --> 02:54:15.684]  Because he had brought a lot of pain to Latin America with his dead squads and the drug trafficking with his people, Oliver North, Felix Rodriguez, Posadas, and a whole bunch of other people.
[02:54:15.844 --> 02:54:22.349]  And, of course, at the end of the day, he ended up pardoning at least eight of those individuals that were involved in these atrocities.
[02:54:23.710 --> 02:54:26.071]  And North gets to prance around like a conservative.
[02:54:26.372 --> 02:54:26.872]  Exactly.
[02:54:26.892 --> 02:54:27.893]  You know, he lied to Congress.
[02:54:27.913 --> 02:54:28.954]  He's a convicted felon.
[02:54:28.994 --> 02:54:30.114]  I don't care what anybody says.
[02:54:30.174 --> 02:54:30.875]  He was convicted.
[02:54:31.625 --> 02:54:33.406]  And, you know, later he was dismissed.
[02:54:33.446 --> 02:54:37.968]  But, you know, his price was to go work for Fox News.
[02:54:39.169 --> 02:54:40.709]  Which is a known government front.
[02:54:40.949 --> 02:54:41.450]  Exactly.
[02:54:41.590 --> 02:54:44.871]  I mean, hell, look at Snow now, White House Press Secretary.
[02:54:44.971 --> 02:54:45.331]  Yeah.
[02:54:45.932 --> 02:54:46.872]  Okay, caller, thank you.
[02:54:46.912 --> 02:54:47.412]  Great call.
[02:54:47.432 --> 02:54:50.194]  Call me back tomorrow because you're a great caller and I'm sorry to be cutting you short.
[02:54:50.534 --> 02:54:51.774]  Bill in New Jersey, go ahead.
[02:54:51.794 --> 02:54:59.478]  New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is attending a mayor's meeting in Pennsylvania today discussing tougher gun laws.
[02:55:00.174 --> 02:55:08.122]  Now, we know this gentleman has sued gun dealers in the southern states and forced two of them to... He's already got basically a gun ban in New York.
[02:55:08.162 --> 02:55:08.903]  What else does he want?
[02:55:08.943 --> 02:55:10.704]  Or is he trying to do it in other states?
[02:55:10.804 --> 02:55:12.766]  He's trying to spread this throughout the nation.
[02:55:12.786 --> 02:55:13.667]  He's a cockroach.
[02:55:17.591 --> 02:55:18.452]  Caller, go ahead and finish up.
[02:55:18.846 --> 02:55:31.597]  Okay, well, he has already gotten two gun dealers in the southern states, I believe one in Georgia, one in North Carolina, to give over their records and keep new records to be shared with the New York City police.
[02:55:31.637 --> 02:55:32.138]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:55:32.298 --> 02:55:39.965]  New York and Chicago are saying they're going to act as national databases for the BATF as a way to get around the federal law.
[02:55:40.393 --> 02:55:42.854]  Yeah, he's also been suing gun dealers as well.
[02:55:43.074 --> 02:55:44.815]  What do you expect from a Republican?
[02:55:44.835 --> 02:55:45.515]  Thanks for the call.
[02:55:46.035 --> 02:55:47.196]  I mean, look at Pataki.
[02:55:47.216 --> 02:55:47.736]  Look at Bush.
[02:55:47.756 --> 02:55:49.457]  They're all a bunch of gun-grabbing trash.
[02:55:49.477 --> 02:55:52.118]  They've got a bunch of idiots with Bush stickers on their cars.
[02:55:52.398 --> 02:55:53.338]  Clay in Florida.
[02:55:53.378 --> 02:55:54.138]  You've got 30 seconds.
[02:55:54.178 --> 02:55:54.579]  Go ahead.
[02:55:55.519 --> 02:55:57.000]  Alex, it's Clay.
[02:55:57.620 --> 02:56:01.441]  I'd like the opportunity to make an announcement, if I could, for Small Storm.
[02:56:01.461 --> 02:56:02.742]  A promotional announcement.
[02:56:03.982 --> 02:56:05.503]  So I'll take up my 30 seconds doing that.
[02:56:06.067 --> 02:56:13.051]  9-11 Mysteries Part 1 Demolitions is the most comprehensive, definitive documentary on the destruction of World Trade Center.
[02:56:13.651 --> 02:56:19.214]  Any rational, open-minded person who watches this film will know that no plane to respond... Absolutely.
[02:56:19.234 --> 02:56:20.495]  We're out of time, and we carry that.
[02:56:20.535 --> 02:56:21.615]  We have it on DVD.
[02:56:21.715 --> 02:56:22.696]  It is a great new film.
[02:56:22.736 --> 02:56:24.016]  Get it at Infowars.com.
[02:56:24.036 --> 02:56:24.617]  God bless you all.
[02:56:24.637 --> 02:56:25.097]  Thanks, Sally.
