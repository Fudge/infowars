[00:00:05.745 --> 00:00:06.386]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.046 --> 00:00:08.106]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.826 --> 00:00:09.926]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.567 --> 00:00:11.387]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.147 --> 00:00:13.027]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.047 --> 00:00:17.368]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.888 --> 00:00:21.969]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:43.565 --> 00:00:49.769]  Live Tuesday, the 7th day of March, 2006 edition, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:55.772]  We'll have wide open phones today and cover masses of vital news and information.
[00:00:56.738 --> 00:01:05.505]  Meet the world's most dangerous terrorists, delivery drivers, chicken farmers, sack makers, taxi drivers, and students.
[00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:15.754]  Their weapons of mass destruction include battery chargers, casino, Casio watches, and peanut oil.
[00:01:17.175 --> 00:01:19.397]  Yes, we'll get into this article also.
[00:01:20.258 --> 00:01:21.599]  All across the nation...
[00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:23.550]  We're good to go.
[00:01:36.426 --> 00:01:48.149]  Every facet of your life will be watched over by the nice commissariat, the nice federal police force in infrastructure protection.
[00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:55.351]  All crime, all misdemeanor is terrorism, as the federal judges just ruled.
[00:01:56.331 --> 00:02:03.693]  Going along with the USA Patriot Act, and now it's going to Bush's desk radically expanded.
[00:02:04.713 --> 00:02:11.794]  Then we have nice little spin articles like, Hey, Guantanamo Bay detainees beg to stay!
[00:02:12.875 --> 00:02:17.136]  And I saw that last night and knew what I'd hear this morning when EOCON, See, they love it!
[00:02:17.676 --> 00:02:19.436]  Why, look at all the food they get!
[00:02:21.036 --> 00:02:28.498]  One of the threats they use is that they'll be sent to one of the stands where they're literally boiled in oil or water.
[00:02:29.138 --> 00:02:33.199]  They'll be sent to one of the torture camps in Eastern Europe where they're tortured to death.
[00:02:34.042 --> 00:02:37.625]  And they all know about this, and it's admitted, they're told.
[00:02:37.965 --> 00:02:39.606]  You'll be taken here and tortured to death.
[00:02:39.927 --> 00:02:43.389]  You think this torture's bad, so they beg, No, please don't torture me!
[00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.950]  No!
[00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.371]  No, don't send me to the death camp!
[00:02:47.172 --> 00:02:51.235]  And many of them just give up, try to commit suicide, and say, Fine, send me to the death camp.
[00:02:51.255 --> 00:02:52.836]  And they are sent to the death camp, don't worry.
[00:02:53.557 --> 00:02:58.921]  But then by the time the neocons spin it, see, they're begging to stay at Camp Oats Ray.
[00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.202]  Camp X-Ray, as I said three years ago, is just kind of a little wonderland.
[00:03:04.303 --> 00:03:07.024]  A promotion arm for the American people.
[00:03:07.404 --> 00:03:08.445]  Torture light.
[00:03:08.485 --> 00:03:16.489]  And then, of course, it came out all the rendition and torture centers all over the world where they rape your wife or worse in front of you.
[00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.772]  It's all part of the new freedom that America is sharing with the world.
[00:03:23.852 --> 00:03:27.595]  By the time you hear the neocons, they'll just say, look at this headline.
[00:03:27.995 --> 00:03:30.136]  They love Camp X-Ray.
[00:03:30.196 --> 00:03:31.337]  What a sick joke.
[00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:34.699]  And I'll have mindless, dull-eyed people stop me in the street.
[00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.280]  Hey, man, they like it at the camp.
[00:03:39.181 --> 00:03:43.904]  Like that congressman a few years ago with the plate of food going, look how good they eat.
[00:03:45.737 --> 00:03:47.938]  They're eating real good over there.
[00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.600]  Did the Pentagon create orbital space plane?
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.621]  I mentioned this yesterday.
[00:03:53.641 --> 00:03:55.422]  I never really got into it in more detail.
[00:03:55.542 --> 00:03:56.942]  I want to today.
[00:03:58.303 --> 00:04:00.224]  Also, the troops.
[00:04:00.524 --> 00:04:01.985]  You stick the sticker on your car.
[00:04:02.045 --> 00:04:03.746]  You claim, hey, I support the troops.
[00:04:03.786 --> 00:04:10.189]  Well, in a major poll, 72% of the troops want out of Iraq now.
[00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.410]  You don't really support the troops.
[00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.771]  You support the president and the great leader.
[00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:19.351]  Really serious news headline here.
[00:04:19.572 --> 00:04:38.935]  Sun's next 11-year cycle could be 50% stronger than the current cycle that's now ending, which they are saying is the record cycle in the last 100 years that they've been recording the radiated power output of Sol, of the center of the solar system.
[00:04:40.766 --> 00:04:43.207]  And also, another article concerning similar things.
[00:04:43.267 --> 00:04:44.808]  Think Pompeii got hit hard?
[00:04:45.328 --> 00:04:47.489]  Worse eruptions lurk.
[00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.271]  So, it's more on Iran.
[00:04:51.411 --> 00:04:51.931]  So much.
[00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:53.572]  We'll cover the news.
[00:04:53.892 --> 00:04:55.012]  Get to your calls.
[00:04:56.013 --> 00:04:56.733]  Stay with us.
[00:04:56.973 --> 00:04:58.174]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:58.234 --> 00:04:58.934]  PrismPlanet.tv
[00:05:01.394 --> 00:05:05.720]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.266]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:13.297 --> 00:05:16.318]  A new world order can emerge.
[00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.240]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:29.243]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.363 --> 00:05:31.384]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.644 --> 00:05:42.147]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.367 --> 00:05:47.768]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:50.909]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:52.150]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.470]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:06:01.095 --> 00:06:02.677]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:03.057 --> 00:06:08.802]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:06:09.062 --> 00:06:14.187]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:06:14.527 --> 00:06:23.816]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:06:24.156 --> 00:06:29.117]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:06:29.437 --> 00:06:33.438]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:06:33.638 --> 00:06:38.419]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:44.681]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:06:45.021 --> 00:06:51.250]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[00:06:52.292 --> 00:06:53.233]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:01.903 --> 00:07:08.267]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:07:08.487 --> 00:07:13.489]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:21.714]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:07:21.874 --> 00:07:28.918]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:07:29.138 --> 00:07:30.358]  There are no side effects.
[00:07:30.498 --> 00:07:33.879]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:07:33.939 --> 00:07:35.060]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.620]  Eliminate the cause.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:43.662]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:07:43.782 --> 00:07:46.223]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[00:07:49.425 --> 00:07:50.385]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:08:02.063 --> 00:08:04.244]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.825 --> 00:08:07.686]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.288 --> 00:08:25.476]  We have an interesting article here.
[00:08:26.037 --> 00:08:27.998]  Now the Las Vegas Sun, A.P.,
[00:08:29.241 --> 00:08:32.702]  Thousands of federal cases kept secret.
[00:08:33.922 --> 00:08:47.366]  And it says, despite the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of public trials, nearly all records are being kept secret from more than 5,000 defendants who completed their journey through the federal courts over the last three years.
[00:08:47.466 --> 00:08:50.686]  Instances of such secrecy more than doubled from 2003 to 2005.
[00:08:53.340 --> 00:09:01.360]  And it goes on to report that these, of course, were non-terrorism cases, but all crime is terror, so it is terror just like the New York Sun reported.
[00:09:01.934 --> 00:09:04.235]  This is an AP article posted in the Las Vegas Sun.
[00:09:04.715 --> 00:09:16.741]  An Associated Press investigation found, and court observers agree, that most of these defendants are cooperating government witnesses, but the secrecy surrounding their records prevents the public from knowing the tales of their plea bargains with the government.
[00:09:17.321 --> 00:09:22.863]  Most of these defendants are involved in drug gangs, though lately a very small number come from terrorism cases.
[00:09:23.343 --> 00:09:29.086]  Some of these cooperating witnesses are among the most unsavory characters in America's courts, multiple murderers and drug dealers.
[00:09:29.126 --> 00:09:31.367]  Well, yeah, but they're bearing false witness against innocent people.
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:37.284]  You'll have the same murderer, same drug dealer who's in court every two weeks sending some innocent person to prison.
[00:09:37.324 --> 00:09:38.865]  That's how this country works now.
[00:09:39.645 --> 00:09:40.486]  Gotta keep them safe.
[00:09:40.546 --> 00:09:43.147]  Can't let it be known that criminals are sending good people to prison.
[00:09:43.728 --> 00:09:51.353]  But the public cannot learn whether their testimony against Confederates won them drastically reduced prison sentences or even freedom.
[00:09:52.239 --> 00:10:01.086]  And it goes on to talk about in the nation's capital, which has had serious problems with drug gangs, murdering government witnesses, the secrecy has reached another level.
[00:10:01.426 --> 00:10:07.110]  The use of secret dockets for hundreds of such defendants over the past few years in the city.
[00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:11.353]  Should some acquire the actual case number for them and enter the U.S.
[00:10:11.373 --> 00:10:20.200]  District Court's computerized record system, the computer will falsely reply, no such case, rather than acknowledge that it is a sealed case.
[00:10:22.086 --> 00:10:23.447]  And it goes on.
[00:10:23.767 --> 00:10:26.369]  And, of course, it's all to fight the drugs.
[00:10:26.629 --> 00:10:32.812]  Oh, yes, the government is really fighting the drugs.
[00:10:33.653 --> 00:10:47.261]  It hates the heroin and cocaine and it hates having to ship it in and hates having to bust all their competition and hates putting your kids in private prisons openly owned by the big drug cartels so they get you coming and going.
[00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:48.862]  They play both sides of it.
[00:10:49.463 --> 00:10:50.724]  What a sick joke.
[00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:51.904]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:10:51.964 --> 00:10:56.827]  The court cases are secret now, and no one gets to know what happened.
[00:10:56.887 --> 00:10:57.968]  It's freedom!
[00:10:58.368 --> 00:11:00.109]  We have to fight Al-Qaeda!
[00:11:00.569 --> 00:11:02.450]  We have to fight the drug dealers!
[00:11:04.471 --> 00:11:13.976]  Before I get into Iran and all this other news, and there is a lot of it today, before I do that, I want to get into these two articles.
[00:11:14.796 --> 00:11:17.638]  They're both excellent stories written by the
[00:11:18.698 --> 00:11:23.882]  By the Watsonians, Steve Watson and Paul Watson.
[00:11:23.902 --> 00:11:25.904]  I'm having a moment of frustration here.
[00:11:25.944 --> 00:11:30.568]  I just had the second article in my hot little hand and can't find it.
[00:11:30.588 --> 00:11:31.208]  Well, here's one of them.
[00:11:31.228 --> 00:11:32.309]  I'll find the next one during the break.
[00:11:33.411 --> 00:11:36.173]  Meet the world's most dangerous terrorists.
[00:11:36.293 --> 00:11:41.256]  Delivery drivers, chicken farmers, sack makers, taxi drivers, and students.
[00:11:41.697 --> 00:11:47.961]  Their weapons of mass destruction include battery chargers, Casio watches, and peanut oil.
[00:11:48.001 --> 00:11:51.123]  And it is a long article, an excellent article that he's written.
[00:11:51.143 --> 00:11:54.265]  We can't read the entire thing.
[00:11:54.345 --> 00:11:55.886]  Five pages, small type.
[00:11:55.926 --> 00:12:00.329]  But it goes on, and of course every statement he makes is a hyperlink to where they admit it.
[00:12:01.207 --> 00:12:07.390]  The release of names and backgrounds of the Guantanamo inmates has revealed what we knew all along.
[00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:10.611]  The world's most dangerous terrorists are nothing of the sort.
[00:12:10.652 --> 00:12:17.795]  They are poor farmers and the like who have simply been grabbed and stuck in cages and publicly tortured for the past four years.
[00:12:18.355 --> 00:12:27.399]  We have tirelessly exposed that no Al-Qaeda leaders have been captured or discovered at Guantanamo Bay either firsthand or via information garnered through torture.
[00:12:27.499 --> 00:12:28.360]  That includes...
[00:12:29.408 --> 00:12:31.970]  Women and blood, that's all I'll say, and many other things.
[00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.950]  A U.S.
[00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:38.753]  Army official visiting Camp Delta was quoted in 2002 as saying, there are no big fish there.
[00:12:38.893 --> 00:12:42.255]  Some of these guys literally don't know the world is round.
[00:12:43.475 --> 00:12:44.476]  Yeah, they've questioned them.
[00:12:44.496 --> 00:12:46.337]  They can't find America, don't know what it is.
[00:12:46.777 --> 00:12:48.678]  They grew up in little villages and never left.
[00:12:48.838 --> 00:12:56.682]  And the actual Al-Qaeda and other Taliban CIA agents, and we've had the former CIA section chief want to talk about this.
[00:12:56.722 --> 00:12:57.403]  He was also on MSNBC.
[00:12:58.636 --> 00:13:02.620]  They just pull up at villages and just arrest everyone and take them to the camps all over the world.
[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.401]  You've got to have the illusion.
[00:13:04.421 --> 00:13:05.903]  I mean, they don't just have fake camps.
[00:13:05.923 --> 00:13:07.044]  They don't just have innocent people.
[00:13:07.324 --> 00:13:08.745]  Why, that's ridiculous, Alex.
[00:13:08.805 --> 00:13:09.266]  Well, no.
[00:13:09.546 --> 00:13:10.147]  Yes, they do.
[00:13:11.928 --> 00:13:13.690]  And they enjoy it.
[00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:14.991]  This is what they're all about.
[00:13:15.966 --> 00:13:39.646]  And it goes on, a recent statistical report based entirely on data supplied by the Defense Department and intended to provide a more detailed picture of who the Guantanamo detainees are, how they ended up there, and the purposes and purported basis for their enemy combatant designation has found that fewer than half of the 570 detainees whose histories were reviewed had been accused of any hostile acts.
[00:13:40.506 --> 00:13:41.968]  Now, that's just one of over 50.
[00:13:45.725 --> 00:13:53.067]  There's 30-something in Iraq alone, but 50-plus Black World sites around the planet.
[00:13:53.507 --> 00:13:55.447]  That's what the Pentagon calls it, Black World.
[00:13:56.447 --> 00:14:06.990]  According to the report conducted by counsel of the detainees at Guantanamo, 40% of the inmates have no definitive connection with al-Qaeda at all.
[00:14:09.036 --> 00:14:10.197]  They haven't been an employee of the U.S.
[00:14:10.217 --> 00:14:10.677]  government, huh?
[00:14:11.338 --> 00:14:22.972]  And so, now it is being reported that under an enormous amount of pressure, the Pentagon has finally been forced into releasing further information about the inmates being held in the Gulag in Cuba.
[00:14:23.592 --> 00:14:27.277]  Although the vast majority of the detainees deny any links or knowledge...
[00:14:27.737 --> 00:14:30.761]  About Al-Qaeda, even after torture, or the Taliban.
[00:14:30.801 --> 00:14:37.450]  Dick Cheney has said they're bomb makers, they're facilitators of terror, they're members of Al-Qaeda and the Taliban.
[00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:41.256]  If you let them out, they'll go back to trying to kill Americans.
[00:14:42.446 --> 00:14:43.047]  That's a quote.
[00:15:00.627 --> 00:15:00.847]  U.S.
[00:15:00.927 --> 00:15:05.851]  and Afghan forces found a Kalashnikov rifle in his house, which every man over there has.
[00:15:05.891 --> 00:15:07.092]  He better have it to protect his family.
[00:15:07.432 --> 00:15:12.736]  And that made him a suspect in an attack carried out by the Taliban because they used the same guns.
[00:15:12.996 --> 00:15:14.057]  Oh, he's so evil.
[00:15:14.457 --> 00:15:15.598]  And that's the main weapon over there.
[00:15:15.618 --> 00:15:16.638]  That's about all they have.
[00:15:17.979 --> 00:15:24.964]  No matter that the country was littered with these weapons throughout the 70s and 80s during the Russian invasion, and literally every farmer has one.
[00:15:25.084 --> 00:15:25.665]  And that's true.
[00:15:25.685 --> 00:15:27.346]  Everyone has about three of them.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:35.805]  Hasvullah Saab, also a farmer, was arrested for wearing an olive green military jacket.
[00:15:36.785 --> 00:15:37.806]  A certain terrorist.
[00:15:37.926 --> 00:15:41.168]  Now, where could he have possibly gotten that jacket from?
[00:15:41.208 --> 00:15:48.774]  In a country that has experienced constant war with several different nations over the past three decades, must have been Taliban.
[00:15:49.838 --> 00:15:51.520]  I mean, I went and bought an old U.S.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.782]  Army jacket, a waterproof one from the local sporting goods store.
[00:15:55.063 --> 00:15:56.144]  Maybe I'll go to get Moe.
[00:15:56.484 --> 00:16:04.811]  Well, he had an Army jacket, and the reason I bought it is it said Travis, and I like Travis County, where I live, Colonel Travis, Alamo.
[00:16:06.513 --> 00:16:08.374]  Oh, certain Elkhart approved.
[00:16:10.516 --> 00:16:15.200]  And I have articles here where they're admitting, oh, you had a battery charger.
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.962]  Oh, you had some peanut oil.
[00:16:18.132 --> 00:16:32.459]  Abdar Saeed Rahman, a chicken farmer, was arrested and remains at Camp Delta because his name is similar to a known military judge or deputy foreign minister of the Taliban, Adir Saeed Rahman.
[00:16:33.214 --> 00:16:36.779]  Well, it's nearly the same, but they must both be Taliban.
[00:16:37.219 --> 00:16:50.636]  Zain Uy Abedin, initially listed as Jamal John, a native of Tajikistan, born in 1978, was captured in Masir al-Sharif, Afghanistan, by coalition forces on July 3, 2003.
[00:16:52.017 --> 00:16:53.858]  He told the tribunal that the U.S.
[00:16:53.898 --> 00:16:55.858]  forces had arrested the wrong man.
[00:16:56.298 --> 00:16:56.979]  That's true.
[00:16:56.999 --> 00:16:59.579]  The people who found me, that's me.
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.700]  They arrested me, but I'm not that name.
[00:17:02.841 --> 00:17:05.001]  I don't know what they call me.
[00:17:05.021 --> 00:17:07.982]  I'm not that person.
[00:17:08.042 --> 00:17:10.303]  Turns out he was a taxi driver.
[00:17:11.636 --> 00:17:18.145]  Imad Abdallah was a student in Yemen, but was arrested when he visited a university in Pakistan.
[00:17:18.185 --> 00:17:19.086]  The evidence against him?
[00:17:19.406 --> 00:17:21.089]  He had a copy of the Koran.
[00:17:21.269 --> 00:17:23.992]  Oh, absolute clear definitive proof right there.
[00:17:25.054 --> 00:17:27.137]  Habib Noor was arrested because...
[00:17:28.017 --> 00:17:33.401]  His mentally unstable brother was accused of fighting with the Taliban on the front lines.
[00:17:33.841 --> 00:17:39.404]  He is also accused of owning land that some attackers fled to after ambushing U.S.
[00:17:39.424 --> 00:17:42.546]  special forces and Afghan military forces.
[00:17:43.007 --> 00:17:48.310]  I was just making sacks to sell at the bazaar to make money for my family, North said.
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:18:02.625]  Salil Uzer has insisted his purpose for travel to Turkey and Afghanistan in 2000 was to study Arabic, but no, no, no, he is thought to be clearly a bomb maker by U.S.
[00:18:02.645 --> 00:18:10.648]  officials because he was caught wearing a Casio watch, which is apparently the watch choice of bomb-making Taliban.
[00:18:11.303 --> 00:18:14.404]  These are the hardcore, the ones we cannot let go.
[00:18:14.724 --> 00:18:17.024]  We must keep them in cages, chained to walls.
[00:18:17.404 --> 00:18:23.726]  The truth is there are no Taliban or al-Qaeda top brass at Guantanamo because they were all flown out on U.S.
[00:18:23.786 --> 00:18:29.507]  planes in a deal done with Pakistan in late 2001 as the invasion began.
[00:18:29.527 --> 00:18:31.808]  They were good government agents being protected.
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:41.348]  Then it goes on to talk about how they're intelligence informants and how they actually breed intelligence informants and minions, servants, inside these torture camps.
[00:18:42.008 --> 00:18:54.339]  And it gets into how a SWAT terror expert, John Lott, this has gone on record, with the fact that one of the key figures behind the July 7th London bombings, Haroun Rashid, a SWAT, was in the service of British intelligence.
[00:18:55.259 --> 00:19:02.981]  And it goes into just page after page of more evidence of government being behind the terror and controlling al-Qaeda, creating al-Qaeda.
[00:19:03.861 --> 00:19:09.062]  When we get back, I will cover the next article.
[00:19:10.963 --> 00:19:16.504]  And that concerns all mainstream media reports about what Homeland Security is up to.
[00:19:16.524 --> 00:19:23.466]  And this makes the old days of raiding toy stores for selling out-of-date Rubik's Cubes
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.441]  Or knock off Rubik's cubes, look pale.
[00:19:26.481 --> 00:19:35.127]  These newest developments make arresting homeless people sleeping on park benches under Patriot Act and charging them as terrorists look feeble.
[00:19:35.927 --> 00:19:42.592]  Why, this new chronicle, flooded out in the last few days, is mind-blowing.
[00:19:44.213 --> 00:19:48.435]  And then that integrates in with the other stories I have here.
[00:19:49.456 --> 00:19:52.258]  Any cold medicine you get will be tracked by Homeland Security.
[00:19:53.041 --> 00:19:54.145]  Don't have to tell me about it.
[00:19:54.185 --> 00:19:58.560]  I had to be registered and have my license scanned to get some Sudafed a few weeks ago.
[00:19:58.580 --> 00:19:59.603]  All part of being a slave.
[00:20:01.528 --> 00:20:03.749]  Nancy McKimson of Jacksonville, Florida says...
[00:20:24.838 --> 00:20:28.381]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, everything stays fresh much longer.
[00:20:28.641 --> 00:20:31.884]  Like strawberries, which now last a couple of weeks instead of just a few days.
[00:20:32.145 --> 00:20:35.688]  Jane Burke of New Jersey says... You know, we eat a lot of salads.
[00:20:35.848 --> 00:20:39.311]  I used to throw out the leftovers because they'd turn brown and they'd shrivel up.
[00:20:39.451 --> 00:20:40.712]  I'm really amazed.
[00:20:40.872 --> 00:20:46.738]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, all my produce stays fresher longer, including the leftovers.
[00:20:46.878 --> 00:20:49.280]  Now I just couldn't get along without Forever Fresh.
[00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:57.767]  To order your Forever Fresh for the fridge, visit the web at foreverfresh.us or call toll-free 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[00:20:57.927 --> 00:20:59.928]  That's 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[00:21:06.353 --> 00:21:09.656]  Currency devaluation, inflation, one and the same.
[00:21:10.357 --> 00:21:11.678]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%,
[00:21:14.696 --> 00:21:20.178]  In a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:21:20.599 --> 00:21:23.720]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:25.821]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:21:26.061 --> 00:21:28.882]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:21:29.443 --> 00:21:31.663]  Here is reality.
[00:21:32.024 --> 00:21:35.605]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:21:36.105 --> 00:21:39.767]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:21:40.327 --> 00:21:43.149]  Gold, in the same time frame, increased 35% in value.
[00:21:44.511 --> 00:21:44.952]  We're good to go.
[00:22:00.715 --> 00:22:09.338]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:22:09.558 --> 00:22:20.781]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:22:21.041 --> 00:22:21.521]  We're good to go.
[00:22:44.992 --> 00:22:48.914]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:22:48.934 --> 00:22:49.635]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:22:49.655 --> 00:22:50.355]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:23:00.771 --> 00:23:02.252]  Hey folks, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:23:02.592 --> 00:23:06.553]  You've all heard me on the radio talking about the importance of investing in precious metals.
[00:23:06.933 --> 00:23:10.455]  I feel it's time for me to talk about the importance of investing in your health.
[00:23:10.835 --> 00:23:14.376]  I was presented with the opportunity to try TriVibes from TriVortex.
[00:23:14.776 --> 00:23:19.638]  I was a bit hesitant of the idea of absorbing vitamins by wearing them rather than ingesting them.
[00:23:19.978 --> 00:23:25.761]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[00:23:26.081 --> 00:23:32.204]  I now wear my TriVibes bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever, not only physically, but also mentally.
[00:23:32.224 --> 00:23:38.307]  TriVortex also offers amazingly beneficial and beautiful jewelry worn by the women around the office daily.
[00:23:38.747 --> 00:23:39.929]  TriVortex is amazing.
[00:23:40.249 --> 00:23:41.370]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:46.877]  Try TriVortex yourself and have fun and learn with the tests found on TriVortex.com.
[00:23:47.077 --> 00:23:50.541]  That's T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com.
[00:23:50.822 --> 00:23:52.123]  Or call my friend Brian at 619-884-1455.
[00:23:52.163 --> 00:23:52.443]  That's 619-884-1455.
[00:24:04.409 --> 00:24:04.910]  Don't worry.
[00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:06.912]  This show is documented.
[00:24:07.432 --> 00:24:10.216]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:10.576 --> 00:24:14.060]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:18.605]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:24:19.166 --> 00:24:21.068]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[00:24:21.883 --> 00:24:24.706]  Another article Paul Watson put out today.
[00:24:26.367 --> 00:24:27.408]  Borrowed some money?
[00:24:27.488 --> 00:24:32.112]  You may be with Al-Qaeda, another victim of Homeland Security financial snoops.
[00:24:32.652 --> 00:24:44.783]  Last week's story about a retired Texas school teacher who came under a Homeland Security microscope for paying off a $6,522 credit card debt has been trumped by a similar case involving the amount of just $650.
[00:24:47.904 --> 00:24:58.012]  Previously, Walter Soenge, I'm going to get him on, made national headlines when he attempted to pay off the credit card debt he had on MasterCard.
[00:24:58.852 --> 00:25:03.896]  The payment was rejected and automatically triggered an investigation by Homeland Security.
[00:25:04.657 --> 00:25:09.221]  Now we have the story of Eddie Booth, a community college professor in East Texas.
[00:25:09.961 --> 00:25:11.482]  Just stuff going on in Texas.
[00:25:11.903 --> 00:25:22.171]  Trying to pay off her February credit card bill, Booth found her funds were short and so asked to borrow $650 from her sister to avoid an interest overcharge of $140.
[00:25:22.251 --> 00:25:30.897]  Booth made a $3,500 payment from her own account and then sent the other $650 with permission from her sister's electronic account.
[00:25:31.418 --> 00:25:33.840]  I watched the status of these two payments online.
[00:25:35.322 --> 00:25:41.366]  The $650 was pending one day and then showed the funded the next.
[00:25:41.506 --> 00:25:42.667]  All seemed fine, however.
[00:25:42.727 --> 00:25:46.989]  I checked back and the status online in the next five days.
[00:25:47.069 --> 00:25:53.153]  On the sixth day, I found an extra $650 payment canceled upon calling the credit card company.
[00:25:53.233 --> 00:25:59.957]  Booth was told that Homeland Security would not allow her to make two payments from two different sources in the same day.
[00:26:00.117 --> 00:26:02.959]  So see, and the article goes on and on.
[00:26:03.279 --> 00:26:04.800]  It's up on Infowars.com and
[00:26:05.465 --> 00:26:07.385]  And PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:26:08.406 --> 00:26:15.667]  But you have to understand, it isn't like the government snoops on a few people or listens to a few foreign phone calls.
[00:26:15.867 --> 00:26:17.628]  Everything runs through the government.
[00:26:18.268 --> 00:26:31.031]  Every prescription you get, whether it's for a prosthesis or for a prescription-strength ibuprofen, whatever it is, birth control, it all instantly is uploaded to Homeland Security.
[00:26:31.787 --> 00:26:32.067]  I think?
[00:26:53.608 --> 00:26:55.429]  And where's the Fourth Amendment?
[00:26:55.449 --> 00:26:56.490]  Well, it's out the window.
[00:26:56.530 --> 00:27:02.512]  See, now Gonzales last week's going, well, maybe there are more spy programs than what we just told you about.
[00:27:02.552 --> 00:27:03.973]  Well, we already know.
[00:27:04.834 --> 00:27:05.814]  We already know.
[00:27:06.975 --> 00:27:17.920]  It's admitted that everything, all the telecommunications are wired through NSA hubs put in the late 1990s in every telecommunications grid and hub in the world.
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:19.461]  We're good to go.
[00:27:41.261 --> 00:27:44.182]  And people say, well, we better shut up, then they'll get us.
[00:27:44.262 --> 00:27:46.263]  Well, there's the evidence of the tyranny.
[00:27:46.303 --> 00:27:48.104]  There's the evidence of the control grid.
[00:27:48.124 --> 00:27:59.009]  And they're just racing ahead to put the toll roads and the transponder tracking systems, the RFID and all the police cars and our cars and the badges, and to have a job anywhere.
[00:27:59.029 --> 00:28:03.291]  They're now admitting, oh, you'll have to have an ID badge because terrorists might get us.
[00:28:03.332 --> 00:28:04.652]  But the border stays wide open.
[00:28:05.052 --> 00:28:06.353]  It's a sick joke.
[00:28:08.124 --> 00:28:10.085]  We're all going to live like prisoners.
[00:28:10.285 --> 00:28:15.107]  America's being turned into one giant prison.
[00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:17.528]  That's all that's happening.
[00:28:20.389 --> 00:28:28.273]  And it goes on, this is a monumental waste of time, and if there were any real terrorists out there, Homeland Security is more interested in your spending habits than Al-Qaeda.
[00:28:28.753 --> 00:28:31.174]  As Eddie Booth points out, this is such insanity.
[00:28:31.234 --> 00:28:37.337]  I mean, if you're paying your credit card, you've already obtained the explosives or whatever some time before.
[00:28:38.419 --> 00:28:40.120]  What is this leadership?
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.741]  When will we get some relief from these morons?
[00:28:43.881 --> 00:28:45.661]  They're not morons, Eddie Booth.
[00:28:46.521 --> 00:28:46.982]  Okay?
[00:28:47.322 --> 00:28:48.322]  They're not stupid.
[00:28:48.742 --> 00:28:50.543]  You understand, you're the terrorist, Bubba.
[00:28:51.003 --> 00:28:54.244]  You're being scrapped down for raping by the government.
[00:28:54.604 --> 00:28:55.504]  That's all this is.
[00:28:56.024 --> 00:28:58.085]  The very individuals you use 9-11 to force...
[00:28:59.624 --> 00:29:07.528]  Layer upon layer of increased state surveillance and big government bureaucracy upon us are the ones in business with Osama bin Laden and Al-Qaeda.
[00:29:07.948 --> 00:29:13.731]  And yet it is the law-abiding citizens that get hassled for the simple desire to pay off some debt.
[00:29:14.192 --> 00:29:18.574]  Homeland security targets, toy store owners, t-shirt sellers, kindergartners, while...
[00:29:19.254 --> 00:29:33.677]  Hiring former East German Stasi heads to spy upon Americans and recruiting tattletale squads under Highway Watch, a program that encourages truckers, toll takers, road crews and bus drivers to watch their fellow citizens and report suspicious activity.
[00:29:34.137 --> 00:29:43.238]  It seems painfully obvious that the people trying to take away our freedoms are not wearing turbans and shouting Allah Akbar, but are the enemy is within the gates.
[00:29:44.359 --> 00:29:45.719]  We'll be right back with more news.
[00:29:45.739 --> 00:29:46.259]  Your call.
[00:29:46.279 --> 00:29:46.759]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.727 --> 00:29:52.628]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.128 --> 00:29:54.729]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:58.431]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.653 --> 00:30:02.754]  You don't love me anymore?
[00:30:03.074 --> 00:30:04.895]  You used to take such good care of me.
[00:30:04.915 --> 00:30:06.376]  Is that my car talking to me?
[00:30:06.516 --> 00:30:10.119]  Yes, you neglect me, change my oil late most of the time.
[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:12.940]  Use the cheapest gas?
[00:30:13.281 --> 00:30:14.161]  I'm getting sick.
[00:30:14.481 --> 00:30:16.643]  One of these days, I'm just gonna give up.
[00:30:17.703 --> 00:30:18.163]  Wait a minute.
[00:30:18.263 --> 00:30:19.884]  I've got three more years of payments on you.
[00:30:20.104 --> 00:30:28.686]  If you want me to last forever, you need to add protected engine treatment, protected transmission treatment, and especially protected complete fuel system treatment.
[00:30:29.127 --> 00:30:34.608]  Protected unique synthetic fortifiers treat the metal and the oil to reduce friction like no other.
[00:30:34.828 --> 00:30:37.229]  Okay, I'll add some protecta, but you'll have to perform.
[00:30:37.369 --> 00:30:42.032]  How about faster acceleration, more horsepower, longer lasting.
[00:30:42.252 --> 00:30:43.913]  I'll always be there for you.
[00:30:44.113 --> 00:30:47.435]  So if you want more, treat it right with Protecta by SFR.
[00:30:47.615 --> 00:30:51.438]  For a special offer of free shipping, go to www.sfrcorp.com or call 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:30:51.458 --> 00:30:53.379]  That's www.sfrcorp.com or call 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:31:01.804 --> 00:31:09.308]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:31:09.588 --> 00:31:20.514]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:31:20.774 --> 00:31:22.575]  Yet require very little energy.
[00:31:22.855 --> 00:31:26.178]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:31:26.498 --> 00:31:36.945]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:31:37.245 --> 00:31:37.745]  That's right.
[00:31:37.926 --> 00:31:45.050]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:54.095]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:54.135 --> 00:31:54.596]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:32:02.395 --> 00:32:05.718]  And now a word from Dr. Patricia Margaitis from Stem Enhance.
[00:32:06.138 --> 00:32:10.301]  I want to first thank the wonderful GCN listeners for supporting Stem Enhance.
[00:32:10.841 --> 00:32:18.227]  Now know that your own stem cells are your body's maintenance group, and Stem Enhance makes sure that more of them show up for work every day.
[00:32:18.652 --> 00:32:22.637]  The truth is, the more stem cells you have in your bloodstream, the greater your health.
[00:32:23.017 --> 00:32:36.433]  If you believe there is something more for you, have a strong work ethic, and wish to participate in the monumental increase in the cause for natural health while gaining financial independence and monthly cash flow, then you are the right person.
[00:32:36.873 --> 00:32:40.257]  I personally invite you to join me as a distributor of Stem & Hands.
[00:32:40.657 --> 00:32:44.921]  I am committed to personally make sure you receive the tools needed to succeed.
[00:32:45.262 --> 00:32:48.185]  Remember, the first rule of success, you must show up.
[00:32:48.345 --> 00:32:51.648]  Call me, Dr. Patricia Margitis, at 860-567-7744.
[00:32:51.708 --> 00:32:52.669]  That number again, 860-567-7744.
[00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:15.311]  I know we've got loads of phone lines.
[00:33:15.351 --> 00:33:17.512]  Your calls are coming up wide open phones today.
[00:33:18.352 --> 00:33:21.314]  Revised Patriot Act targets allergy cold meds.
[00:33:21.394 --> 00:33:22.614]  That's the Associated Press.
[00:33:23.515 --> 00:33:26.116]  I have three more articles like this today covering other issues.
[00:33:26.156 --> 00:33:28.017]  I mean, it's a total takeover.
[00:33:28.037 --> 00:33:30.958]  You turn on the news, though, this doesn't affect any citizens.
[00:33:31.038 --> 00:33:32.619]  It's only terror, lady.
[00:33:32.639 --> 00:33:34.199]  You're not for terrorists, are you?
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:38.681]  Wait, you're changing the laws to loot the pension funds.
[00:33:38.721 --> 00:33:39.982]  That's how we fight Al-Qaeda.
[00:33:40.723 --> 00:33:41.324]  Well, wait.
[00:33:41.364 --> 00:33:44.586]  You're violating federal law every day, giving your family members billion-dollar contracts.
[00:33:45.006 --> 00:33:45.487]  Shut up!
[00:33:45.527 --> 00:33:50.190]  Everybody knows that's a thing to weigh down the morale of the troops and break our resistance.
[00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:51.491]  It's a commie lie.
[00:33:51.951 --> 00:33:52.932]  Well, wait a minute.
[00:33:53.973 --> 00:33:56.034]  You're ballooning the size of the government at every level.
[00:33:57.496 --> 00:33:58.756]  More commie lies.
[00:34:00.678 --> 00:34:01.498]  It's just mindless.
[00:34:01.519 --> 00:34:01.819]  Well, wait.
[00:34:01.859 --> 00:34:03.240]  You're trying to pass gun bans.
[00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:05.562]  More commie lies.
[00:34:06.102 --> 00:34:06.802]  Well, wait a minute.
[00:34:07.203 --> 00:34:09.985]  Bush, you say you're against the abortion ban up in the Dakotas.
[00:34:10.735 --> 00:34:11.475]  That's right.
[00:34:11.495 --> 00:34:12.935]  Abortion's conservative.
[00:34:13.416 --> 00:34:14.976]  It's just, well, wait a minute.
[00:34:15.356 --> 00:34:16.616]  Shut up, commie!
[00:34:18.116 --> 00:34:20.097]  You evil pro-life commie!
[00:34:21.457 --> 00:34:29.238]  Before I get into more news and your calls, don't vaccinate before you educate by Mayor Eisenstein, M.D., J.D., M.P.H.
[00:34:29.759 --> 00:34:33.139]  Want to know the truth about vaccines and objective both sides view?
[00:34:33.559 --> 00:34:34.699]  That's why we carry this.
[00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:35.940]  It gives you both sides.
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.300]  It gives you the scientific facts.
[00:34:38.132 --> 00:34:42.075]  You need to get this book if you've got children or you're an adult and you're thinking about vaccinating yourself.
[00:34:42.655 --> 00:34:49.359]  Here's another one, The United Nations Global Straightjacket by Joan Vion, the Agenda 21 Master Global Takeover Program.
[00:34:49.699 --> 00:34:57.384]  She has been to, I forget, it's like 30-something major global meetings and a whole bunch of other ones, and she's really the expert on it.
[00:34:57.805 --> 00:34:58.745]  This book is powerful.
[00:34:58.805 --> 00:34:59.246]  You need it.
[00:34:59.266 --> 00:35:02.147]  It's in our bookstore online at Infowars.com.
[00:35:02.187 --> 00:35:02.888]  All these books are.
[00:35:03.268 --> 00:35:08.033]  The Elite Serial Killers of Lincoln, JFK, RFK, and MLK by Robert Galen Ross, Sr.
[00:35:08.053 --> 00:35:10.014]  An amazing book that you need to have.
[00:35:10.475 --> 00:35:13.258]  Another one here, Jim Tucker's Bilderberg Diary.
[00:35:13.298 --> 00:35:15.680]  His 26-plus years now.
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:17.281]  This book just came out last year.
[00:35:17.722 --> 00:35:25.529]  Full of photos and documents and the globalists and how they run the planet and what he learned from covering the elite for now over a quarter century.
[00:35:25.569 --> 00:35:26.350]  We've got that book.
[00:35:27.324 --> 00:35:32.326]  The Coming Battle, Getting into the Federal Reserve Takeover System, written in 1898.
[00:35:32.426 --> 00:35:44.771]  This book is powerful, showing the folks that were way back before the turn of the last century battling the New World Order and how they wanted to dumb the American people down and what the American banking associations were doing and what was going on.
[00:35:45.914 --> 00:35:53.877]  And the all-time best 9-11 book I've read, 9-1-1 Synthetic Terror, made in the USA by Webster Griffin Tarbley.
[00:35:54.497 --> 00:36:03.621]  He's got the same views, same analysis, spot on, the same conclusions we've come to here, full of diagrams, documents, photos, graphs.
[00:36:04.061 --> 00:36:10.343]  It's a long book, but an easy read because each chapter is so condensed and so well written.
[00:36:10.383 --> 00:36:11.324]  You need this book.
[00:36:11.564 --> 00:36:13.624]  There's a bunch of other books and videos we're carrying.
[00:36:13.664 --> 00:36:15.145]  We have Dylan Avery's Loose Change Podcast.
[00:36:15.405 --> 00:36:16.186]  Second edition.
[00:36:16.726 --> 00:36:18.027]  Excellent 9-11 film.
[00:36:18.067 --> 00:36:18.948]  My 9-11 film.
[00:36:18.968 --> 00:36:19.448]  My newest.
[00:36:19.809 --> 00:36:25.173]  Martial Law that also gets into the police state and the Bush-Nazi connection and Schwarzenegger and all of it.
[00:36:25.653 --> 00:36:29.176]  And there's also my newest film, The Order of Death, getting into the Illuminati.
[00:36:29.476 --> 00:36:32.578]  The latest infiltration of the Grove by one of their employees last year.
[00:36:32.898 --> 00:36:38.283]  Footage inside the Owl up close of the ritual sacrifices that George Bush and others engage in.
[00:36:38.323 --> 00:36:40.404]  Hey, I don't make this stuff up.
[00:36:40.424 --> 00:36:42.526]  We just report, folks.
[00:36:42.766 --> 00:36:43.967]  That new film is excellent.
[00:36:45.322 --> 00:36:47.924]  Go to infowars.com.
[00:36:47.964 --> 00:36:54.310]  Peruse all the different deals and specials and books and videos and books on tape and T-shirts and bumper stickers.
[00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:56.712]  And we're now carrying the Citizens Rulebooks.
[00:36:56.752 --> 00:36:58.113]  Just got 2,000 of those in.
[00:36:58.593 --> 00:37:01.155]  Every new order gets one.
[00:37:01.195 --> 00:37:06.700]  With every order you make, big or small, you get a free Citizen Rulebook.
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:10.443]  And if you get an order of multiple items, we're going to throw a couple of them in there.
[00:37:11.539 --> 00:37:13.381]  And you can also buy those in bulk.
[00:37:13.421 --> 00:37:14.842]  You can get 10 of them for $10.
[00:37:15.402 --> 00:37:19.045]  And so we basically don't even make a profit at that rate.
[00:37:21.687 --> 00:37:33.756]  It's a little 90-something page color booklet with a whole history of the Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence, jury nullification, the true power of juries and grand juries, a lot of famous quotes.
[00:37:35.683 --> 00:37:38.185]  I know of no little book that's more powerful.
[00:37:38.446 --> 00:37:40.467]  This is the handbook, the citizen's rule book.
[00:37:40.648 --> 00:37:41.869]  This is the playbook.
[00:37:41.969 --> 00:37:43.490]  You need to have this.
[00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:52.178]  You can read it once this weekend, and just an hour sitting there drinking coffee or whatever you imbibe in, whatever you enjoy, and then read it again in a week.
[00:37:52.771 --> 00:37:55.293]  Read it again in a month and become an expert on it.
[00:37:55.613 --> 00:37:56.534]  Don't just read it once.
[00:37:56.614 --> 00:37:58.075]  Most Americans have never read it once.
[00:37:58.856 --> 00:37:59.917]  Become an American.
[00:37:59.977 --> 00:38:02.719]  I don't think you're really an American until you've read this, folks.
[00:38:02.759 --> 00:38:07.563]  And then you'll see, compare this to what's going on now, and it's 180 degrees.
[00:38:08.664 --> 00:38:10.465]  So, again, we're now carrying those.
[00:38:10.565 --> 00:38:11.326]  Infowars.com.
[00:38:13.752 --> 00:38:16.534]  Or go to prisonplanet.tv to sign up online.
[00:38:16.554 --> 00:38:19.215]  You go to infowars.com to get hard copies delivered to your door.
[00:38:19.575 --> 00:38:21.636]  Go to prisonplanet.tv.
[00:38:21.656 --> 00:38:29.220]  You get 5.3 months, almost half a year free, when you sign up during this month, the spring special, at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:35.684]  All 14 of my films, my weekly TV show, weekly video interviews in studio here, inside the radio studio.
[00:38:36.701 --> 00:38:48.029]  All my best audio interviews, my book, Paul Watson's book, a bunch of other films, Loose Change 2, Reverend Ted Pike's videos, it's all up there, prisonplanet.tv, and it's a great activist center.
[00:38:48.049 --> 00:38:52.092]  You're allowed to on the site to download my videos and burn them to disk and get them out to folks.
[00:38:52.152 --> 00:38:58.137]  It's an amazing activist tool, prisonplanet.tv, or call toll-free to get hard copies of any of the films, 1-888-253-3139.
[00:38:58.157 --> 00:39:01.419]  People always end up calling and saying, man, it took me weeks to...
[00:39:05.482 --> 00:39:06.022]  Get that number.
[00:39:06.062 --> 00:39:09.784]  Say it twice.
[00:39:09.804 --> 00:39:10.324]  Okay.
[00:39:10.344 --> 00:39:11.264]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:39:11.284 --> 00:39:19.087]  Or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:39:20.568 --> 00:39:22.929]  And you can make copies of all my videos when you order them.
[00:39:23.009 --> 00:39:23.769]  I want you to.
[00:39:23.809 --> 00:39:24.670]  I want you to spread the word.
[00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:26.190]  That's where it has the effect.
[00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:27.531]  That's where it has the power.
[00:39:27.831 --> 00:39:31.072]  Through you standing up to the tyranny and taking action.
[00:39:31.292 --> 00:39:33.233]  Think about that term, standing up.
[00:39:33.948 --> 00:39:35.329]  It means not laying down.
[00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:37.071]  It just means standing up to a bullet.
[00:39:38.772 --> 00:39:47.279]  So many times in my life, when I just stood up to something, when I just bit the bullet and said, I don't care, when I just stood up to a thug, every time it turned out better than laying down.
[00:39:47.339 --> 00:39:48.420]  So stand up, folks.
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:49.140]  All right.
[00:39:49.921 --> 00:39:50.802]  We're going to go to your calls.
[00:39:50.842 --> 00:39:59.469]  In fact, let's just go to your calls now, and then I'll get into what Doug tells with the last report.
[00:40:00.029 --> 00:40:02.391]  In every used car you get, every house you buy,
[00:40:03.158 --> 00:40:09.101]  Every check you cash, every prescription you get, every book you buy at a major bookstore.
[00:40:09.701 --> 00:40:11.282]  Oh, you didn't know it's not just the libraries?
[00:40:13.063 --> 00:40:17.865]  Under the Patriot Act, they are hooked in getting all of that data.
[00:40:17.905 --> 00:40:27.650]  See, now under the new national ID card, the national sales tax being sold by their operatives on talk radio, Mr. Fair Tax, definitely an operative.
[00:40:29.164 --> 00:40:30.384]  Clearly, and I've met him.
[00:40:30.624 --> 00:40:31.785]  I've had a confrontation with him.
[00:40:31.825 --> 00:40:33.206]  I didn't come over and confront me.
[00:40:33.226 --> 00:40:34.907]  I never showed that video.
[00:40:34.967 --> 00:40:35.788]  I'll put it on the website.
[00:40:35.808 --> 00:40:42.272]  The point is, the fair tax, the flat tax, is a complete fraud and is their road to total control.
[00:40:42.292 --> 00:40:47.235]  Is they're going to keep the income tax that's official 10 years ago and give you the sales tax on top of it?
[00:40:47.275 --> 00:40:51.017]  I know, you'll roll your eyes and laugh about it when you're living under bus.
[00:40:51.037 --> 00:40:52.017]  Just remember I told you.
[00:40:52.438 --> 00:40:53.358]  That's the power we got.
[00:40:53.418 --> 00:40:57.621]  We can just tell you what's going to happen and no matter how crazy it sounds, my wife's
[00:40:58.725 --> 00:41:15.651]  Nice father, who's very well educated and worked in the diplomatic corps in the agriculture department, lived in Europe, a smart guy, but he still, he was over with some family yesterday for about an hour, drinking some iced tea outside as some of the in-laws were visiting town.
[00:41:16.551 --> 00:41:23.234]  And he goes, you know, my pastor's having trouble with some of his congregation because he now believes from the evidence that 9-11's an inside job.
[00:41:25.346 --> 00:41:26.586]  He was a pretty mainstream guy.
[00:41:26.746 --> 00:41:27.746]  And I said, what do you think?
[00:41:27.766 --> 00:41:31.047]  He's like, well, yeah, I'm going to give him one of your videos.
[00:41:31.107 --> 00:41:34.928]  So, I mean, it's just getting more and more and more mainstream.
[00:41:35.588 --> 00:41:35.988]  You see?
[00:41:36.608 --> 00:41:38.688]  More and more and more mainstream.
[00:41:39.588 --> 00:41:41.509]  But somebody had to hit the bar bar first.
[00:41:41.549 --> 00:41:43.469]  Somebody had to charge the machine gun nest first.
[00:41:43.809 --> 00:41:45.449]  Somebody had to go over the wall first.
[00:41:45.569 --> 00:41:48.750]  And again, have I been punished for doing that?
[00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:49.030]  No.
[00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:49.830]  Have I been blessed?
[00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:50.270]  Yes.
[00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:53.011]  Did I go through trials and tribulations?
[00:41:53.051 --> 00:41:53.291]  Yes.
[00:41:53.311 --> 00:41:54.311]  But I was happy in it.
[00:41:55.496 --> 00:41:56.437]  I was ready to face it.
[00:41:57.037 --> 00:41:57.998]  I was cheerful about it.
[00:41:58.938 --> 00:42:03.721]  And it just always is darkest before the dawn, my friends.
[00:42:04.501 --> 00:42:05.502]  And it is exciting.
[00:42:06.716 --> 00:42:08.697]  To know that we're going to expose these murdering terrorists.
[00:42:09.157 --> 00:42:12.458]  Yes, it's scary to know that people running our government flew planes into buildings.
[00:42:12.518 --> 00:42:16.320]  Yes, it's scary to know that they engaged in all these crimes.
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:19.321]  That's why we chronicle all the admitted crimes.
[00:42:19.821 --> 00:42:24.423]  Our government admits they carried out hundreds of other bombings and blamed it on their enemies.
[00:42:24.483 --> 00:42:25.824]  That is declassified in public.
[00:42:30.394 --> 00:42:44.149]  Once you go look at all the other examples that are admitted, once you sit there and read off Library of Congress, declassified documents where our government calls for carrying out terror, once you know that, once you check the facts, once you see what I'm saying is true, you are now among the sane.
[00:42:44.189 --> 00:42:45.450]  You are now among the normal.
[00:42:45.731 --> 00:42:47.853]  You are not these people running around posing.
[00:42:47.873 --> 00:42:51.697]  I mean, I talk a lot about this, but I just can't, words can't describe it.
[00:42:52.438 --> 00:42:53.179]  I see people.
[00:42:53.199 --> 00:43:02.108]  I was at the gym yesterday riding the exercise bike for 30 minutes and lifting weights, and I'm sitting up there watching crowds for 30 minutes while I'm riding the bike, and they're all looking around.
[00:43:02.128 --> 00:43:03.629]  They're all real insecure.
[00:43:03.709 --> 00:43:05.050]  They're primping.
[00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:06.031]  They're posing.
[00:43:06.091 --> 00:43:06.872]  They're strutting.
[00:43:07.353 --> 00:43:09.655]  Well, there's nothing wrong with that at a certain level.
[00:43:09.675 --> 00:43:12.478]  That's natural, especially if you're feeling good about yourself and aggressive.
[00:43:12.938 --> 00:43:13.679]  But I was looking.
[00:43:13.699 --> 00:43:16.942]  They weren't doing it because they were feeling good about themselves and were aggressive.
[00:43:17.581 --> 00:43:22.364]  Most of them were just really insecure because there was nothing inside of them.
[00:43:22.624 --> 00:43:25.546]  There was only this outward shell, this projection.
[00:43:25.566 --> 00:43:30.729]  I mean, that's why you go to the grocery store line and it's all People Magazine and National Enquirer.
[00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:33.510]  Oh, look, the star's got cellulite.
[00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:34.851]  Ha, ha, ha, they're dumb.
[00:43:35.191 --> 00:43:36.292]  Let's pull them down.
[00:43:36.552 --> 00:43:39.974]  Because people are jealous and envious and they think that person's attained salvation.
[00:43:40.882 --> 00:43:48.444]  Some type of great success, and they're feeling worthless, and so they can feel okay by seeing the hot shot being sullied.
[00:43:51.324 --> 00:43:53.925]  Meanwhile, there's a whole real world out there.
[00:43:55.245 --> 00:43:57.546]  A whole real world of being engaged.
[00:43:58.746 --> 00:44:07.408]  I mean, it is so much more fun to be in your garden pulling radishes and turnips out of the ground
[00:44:08.257 --> 00:44:08.857]  We're good to go.
[00:44:32.407 --> 00:44:32.767]  We're good to go.
[00:44:32.787 --> 00:44:33.288]  We're good to go.
[00:44:49.474 --> 00:45:02.645]  Tens of billions of dollars a year focused on you to make you feel small, to take a feminine image that isn't natural and isn't what men even want, by the way, and to sell you that you're inadequate.
[00:45:03.106 --> 00:45:15.656]  Men, you're told that running around guzzling beer, grunting, sticking your belly out, worshipping George Bush and saying, nuke them all, turn into a glass parking lot, I love Vince Young, is manly.
[00:45:16.237 --> 00:45:17.898]  And I'm sorry that's not manly.
[00:45:18.681 --> 00:45:30.804]  Manly is knowing that your children are being brainwashed by scientifically crafted curriculum at the public school, and Manly's taking on three jobs if need be to have the money so your wife can stay home and homeschool them, or so you can send them to private school.
[00:45:32.111 --> 00:45:33.372]  That's what manliness is.
[00:45:33.673 --> 00:45:37.917]  Manliness is getting out of debt and working five jobs if need be, 20 hours a day.
[00:45:38.338 --> 00:45:45.024]  Manliness is standing up against corrupt government and going down to the city council and fighting corrupt laws.
[00:45:45.505 --> 00:45:47.587]  Manliness is being at the state legislature.
[00:45:47.967 --> 00:45:53.193]  Manliness is standing up against tyranny and walking up to a police checkpoint and confronting the police.
[00:45:53.753 --> 00:45:59.976]  Manliness is being a leader of your tribe, a leader of your people, defending your people from tyranny and oppression.
[00:46:00.176 --> 00:46:01.476]  That's what manliness is.
[00:46:01.836 --> 00:46:03.837]  Manliness is not sucking your thumb.
[00:46:04.157 --> 00:46:14.062]  Manliness is not the facsimile or the husk or the image of some simulated, prosthesis, sports, gladiatorial diversion.
[00:46:15.502 --> 00:46:16.283]  That ain't it.
[00:46:17.403 --> 00:46:19.444]  You're a bunch of effeminate twerps.
[00:46:20.723 --> 00:46:28.850]  I sit there watching ESPN while I'm on the exercise bike there at the gym, and I just look at it with the sound off, and just the men are a bunch of knitting twits.
[00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:41.480]  They're supposed to be strategizing about legislation and what the local tax assessor's doing and understanding the sophistication of the country's history and knowing their great-grandfather's name and the great things he did.
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:48.526]  Instead, all of the brain's powers of detail and subterfuge and understanding and discernment...
[00:46:48.746 --> 00:46:55.131]  He's gone, and it's all in the endless minutia of how Tiger Woods did and how he'll do in the future.
[00:46:55.411 --> 00:46:56.952]  You see, you're not stupid.
[00:46:56.972 --> 00:46:58.893]  You're distracted.
[00:46:58.913 --> 00:47:00.955]  You're mesmerized.
[00:47:01.255 --> 00:47:02.996]  You've been hypnotized.
[00:47:03.237 --> 00:47:07.800]  And I'm here to slap you upside the head and tell you to wake up!
[00:47:08.821 --> 00:47:11.683]  Murdering criminals run the country.
[00:47:12.083 --> 00:47:15.786]  Lying, murdering, Malthus, Malthusian...
[00:47:17.435 --> 00:47:35.858]  Creatures who've made Faustian deals with the New World Order and are social Darwinists who openly speak in their own policy papers of how they want to kill you and how the war on terror is meant to herd you into the compact cities so they can do that to you at their leisure!
[00:47:38.095 --> 00:47:48.625]  Now, if that isn't something to get upset about, and if that isn't something to get fired up about, and if that isn't something to get worked up about and to stand up concerning, you've got a major malfunction.
[00:47:48.945 --> 00:47:54.130]  Don't you deny what I'm saying out of hand, some of you out there, you neocon twerps.
[00:47:54.711 --> 00:47:59.075]  Don't you sit there and tell me I'm making anything up without checking it out.
[00:47:59.295 --> 00:48:03.279]  Don't you deny what I've said before you even looked into it.
[00:48:05.868 --> 00:48:11.533]  Because as the old cliche goes, if 10% of what I'm saying is true, you're in a lot of trouble.
[00:48:11.833 --> 00:48:12.974]  I'm in a lot of trouble.
[00:48:13.194 --> 00:48:14.615]  We're in a lot of trouble.
[00:48:14.995 --> 00:48:19.639]  And believe me, unfortunately, it's a lot worse than I can even articulate.
[00:48:19.939 --> 00:48:23.702]  Every time I do a report, it ends up being far worse than I thought.
[00:48:23.882 --> 00:48:28.966]  People think I exaggerate until they check out the facts, then they email me and say, look here, it's worse.
[00:48:29.267 --> 00:48:32.169]  Yes, it's much worse than you can even speak.
[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:49.374]  The beauty in this world is so beautiful one cannot describe it with words, and the ugliness in this world is so ugly and so stinking and so wicked, and the heaps of death that it piles up and the beauty it rends, it's indescribable!
[00:48:50.074 --> 00:48:52.056]  And if I sound angry at people, I am!
[00:48:52.076 --> 00:48:55.079]  I use this analogy, I'll use it again.
[00:48:55.099 --> 00:49:00.844]  If your house is on fire, and your neighbor shows up,
[00:49:01.946 --> 00:49:02.467]  We're good to go.
[00:49:26.747 --> 00:49:44.533]  You're mesmerized by the New World Order snake, and you're like a fat little bird sitting up in a tree and its eyes are spinning, and you're mesmerized and you don't even know the jaws of death when they're dripping languid acid from the orifices as it prepares to suck you down into hell itself!
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:49.101]  So listen to me, everyone.
[00:49:49.581 --> 00:49:51.221]  I want you to go to every hill and mountain.
[00:49:51.461 --> 00:50:15.750]  I want you to tell everybody from every church top, from every hill, from every dale, from every valley, from every creek bottom, in every business, in every company, in every church, in every place, in every organization, with your motorcycle or your hot rod club or your VFW or your 4-H club, whatever it is, you've got to be the leaders and get involved in this fight now and stand up against this new world order.
[00:50:17.333 --> 00:50:18.633]  And start being real men.
[00:50:18.713 --> 00:50:19.874]  Start being real women.
[00:50:19.974 --> 00:50:21.874]  Start engaging the New World Order.
[00:50:21.914 --> 00:50:23.675]  Start admitting an enemy when you see it.
[00:50:23.735 --> 00:50:27.055]  Stop denying it just because the enemy wraps itself in a flag.
[00:50:27.335 --> 00:50:30.056]  Just because a wolf wraps itself in sheep's clothing.
[00:50:30.316 --> 00:50:34.637]  Just because they're sneaking up on you with cloaking devices on.
[00:50:34.917 --> 00:50:36.518]  You can see right through it.
[00:50:36.918 --> 00:50:39.378]  Stop convincing yourself that this isn't happening.
[00:50:39.458 --> 00:50:40.659]  I'm sorry it's happening.
[00:50:40.959 --> 00:50:41.979]  I know it's scary.
[00:50:42.972 --> 00:50:47.995]  But the course of not standing up against it is much more dangerous than standing up against it.
[00:50:48.235 --> 00:50:50.796]  So sail for freedom.
[00:50:51.157 --> 00:50:52.257]  Set your course.
[00:50:52.757 --> 00:50:53.838]  And don't deviate.
[00:50:54.859 --> 00:50:55.559]  We're going down.
[00:50:55.579 --> 00:50:56.840]  We're going down with a fight.
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:50:58.861]  And we may just win this thing.
[00:51:02.924 --> 00:51:05.766]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:06.027 --> 00:51:07.608]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:07.948 --> 00:51:12.612]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:12.952 --> 00:51:19.718]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:20.018 --> 00:51:22.000]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:25.042]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:25.142 --> 00:51:29.805]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:30.006 --> 00:51:34.409]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.669 --> 00:51:41.874]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:42.135 --> 00:51:44.556]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:51:44.717 --> 00:51:46.458]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[00:52:01.937 --> 00:52:03.918]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[00:52:03.998 --> 00:52:14.703]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:52:15.083 --> 00:52:19.605]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:52:19.665 --> 00:52:31.011]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:52:31.591 --> 00:52:38.436]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:52:38.837 --> 00:52:40.978]  Your purified water is now ready.
[00:52:41.479 --> 00:52:46.443]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[00:52:46.743 --> 00:52:57.291]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:52:57.551 --> 00:52:58.412]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:01.254 --> 00:53:03.877]  We're good to go.
[00:53:19.093 --> 00:53:19.733]  We're good to go.
[00:53:48.610 --> 00:53:51.712]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:51.872 --> 00:53:57.796]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:01.279 --> 00:54:02.800]  Some said it couldn't happen here.
[00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:03.300]  It has.
[00:54:18.015 --> 00:54:19.155]  Pulling no punches.
[00:54:19.815 --> 00:54:21.996]  Going 110% on Alex Jones, your host.
[00:54:22.336 --> 00:54:23.796]  All right, now we'll start taking calls.
[00:54:25.137 --> 00:54:26.857]  And then we'll get into more news coming up in the next hour.
[00:54:26.897 --> 00:54:28.738]  But first we'll get through all the callers that have been holding.
[00:54:28.778 --> 00:54:32.839]  Gil, Kenneth, James, Alex, Mark, many others.
[00:54:33.819 --> 00:54:35.399]  Gil in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:54:35.459 --> 00:54:35.819]  Welcome.
[00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:41.061]  I'd like to comment first on what you've been going over for the past hour.
[00:54:41.121 --> 00:54:42.701]  Man, if you could just bottle that.
[00:54:43.388 --> 00:54:44.569]  And sell it.
[00:54:44.869 --> 00:54:48.030]  It's better than any power drink I can ever pull off the shelf.
[00:54:48.590 --> 00:54:51.712]  I mean, such enthusiasm, such passion, such faith.
[00:54:51.952 --> 00:54:52.912]  It wakes you up.
[00:54:53.633 --> 00:54:54.993]  I suggest a guest, maybe.
[00:54:55.013 --> 00:54:55.934]  Roy Masters.
[00:54:55.954 --> 00:54:57.694]  You ever heard of Roy Masters?
[00:54:57.714 --> 00:54:59.115]  Yeah, we've had him on.
[00:54:59.135 --> 00:55:02.356]  I don't particularly subscribe to all the stuff he says, but we had him on.
[00:55:02.396 --> 00:55:03.237]  He's interesting.
[00:55:03.517 --> 00:55:05.998]  The fact that he wants people to wake up.
[00:55:07.099 --> 00:55:13.223]  And see reality for what it is is a very important thing that you've been stressing because I see that too.
[00:55:13.263 --> 00:55:15.425]  I look in people's eyes and there's nothing there, man.
[00:55:15.605 --> 00:55:16.706]  I mean, there's nobody at home.
[00:55:17.066 --> 00:55:18.207]  It's just a blank itchiness.
[00:55:18.247 --> 00:55:22.330]  It's all, you know, how can I... They're all at lower animal levels.
[00:55:22.550 --> 00:55:24.952]  Eat, sex, party, relax.
[00:55:26.072 --> 00:55:30.035]  It sounds like one of those science fiction movies where you have the glasses and it says consume.
[00:55:30.516 --> 00:55:32.257]  Yeah, that's They Live, yes.
[00:55:32.637 --> 00:55:34.819]  They live, and that's what I'm saying.
[00:55:35.079 --> 00:55:37.641]  We need a new pair of glasses that wakes us up.
[00:55:37.661 --> 00:55:39.442]  What do you make of Kinky Freeman?
[00:55:39.502 --> 00:55:42.605]  Is he just surface noise, or is he serious about doing something here in Texas?
[00:55:43.866 --> 00:55:45.367]  Well, he's an outsider, definitely.
[00:55:45.387 --> 00:55:47.248]  I mean, he'd be better than what we currently have.
[00:55:47.268 --> 00:55:52.111]  I mean, anything is better than Rick Perry, the gun-grabbing, open-border-promoting creature.
[00:55:52.371 --> 00:55:53.472]  You call him a minion.
[00:55:53.492 --> 00:55:54.613]  Now, what's a minion?
[00:55:54.653 --> 00:55:58.175]  That's someone who does the bidding for someone else, and he's not his own man.
[00:55:58.615 --> 00:56:00.997]  Yeah, a minion's a little demonic servant.
[00:56:01.017 --> 00:56:05.780]  Today's Election Day here in Southeast Texas, and I noticed the Vote Texas thing.
[00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:08.902]  They do not show you that it's electronic voting.
[00:56:09.617 --> 00:56:14.878]  Well, they have an ad going, this new system works real well and sure your vote gets counted.
[00:56:15.338 --> 00:56:16.699]  So enjoy the new system.
[00:56:16.719 --> 00:56:20.100]  I've heard lots of PR propaganda.
[00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:21.600]  They don't even show the electronic.
[00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:23.160]  They don't even say it or mention it.
[00:56:23.781 --> 00:56:26.501]  They have some voting fraud here going with ballot boxes.
[00:56:26.561 --> 00:56:29.202]  Now, they're not ballot boxes with electronic voting, right?
[00:56:29.662 --> 00:56:30.863]  It's all electronically, then.
[00:56:31.083 --> 00:56:32.904]  Well, the entire state doesn't have it.
[00:56:33.064 --> 00:56:45.633]  Travis County, Hayes, and Williamson are totally electronic with the new touchscreen systems, but some counties in the state haven't yet adopted the Central Intelligence Agency gadgets.
[00:56:46.373 --> 00:56:54.499]  Well, since we have it here, I'm going to see how the elections turn out here in a week or so, and I'll let you know if there's any kind of voting fraud and call you back and report from
[00:56:54.884 --> 00:56:57.766]  I'll be your man here in Southeast Texas to let you know.
[00:56:57.806 --> 00:56:58.726]  That's awesome, Gil.
[00:56:58.746 --> 00:56:59.566]  Good to hear from you.
[00:56:59.967 --> 00:57:01.708]  Let's talk to Kenneth in Louisiana.
[00:57:01.728 --> 00:57:02.708]  Kenneth, you're on the air.
[00:57:03.949 --> 00:57:04.469]  Hello, Alex.
[00:57:05.810 --> 00:57:15.275]  I think if Jesus Christ would come back, and he can only use ten words, I think he would say, I called you to be disciples and not half-assed conservatives.
[00:57:15.715 --> 00:57:20.658]  That's what I'm called to talk about, the failure of conservatism in the last 30 to 40 years.
[00:57:22.153 --> 00:57:28.616]  If I can use the football analogy, much of conservatism today plays a prevent defense.
[00:57:29.316 --> 00:57:34.818]  It prevents the long 80-yard bomb, but they'll give up 10 and 15-yard plays every shot.
[00:57:35.178 --> 00:57:36.479]  You know, it's more than that, sir.
[00:57:36.619 --> 00:57:46.083]  Actually, and a lot of former congressmen and current congressmen have said this, it's well known to those that are informed, worse things actually happen under Republicans.
[00:57:46.964 --> 00:57:47.964]  That's the reality.
[00:57:48.064 --> 00:57:56.106]  Bigger government, more police state, seven of the nine members of the Supreme Court are Republican-appointed.
[00:57:56.666 --> 00:57:58.367]  Both parties are equally owned, sir.
[00:57:58.447 --> 00:58:02.368]  I mean, at the committee, chairman, and above level, it's a staged event.
[00:58:03.468 --> 00:58:04.668]  You're absolutely right.
[00:58:04.708 --> 00:58:11.030]  And you were also absolutely right about the modern evangelical church a couple of weeks ago that has gone out.
[00:58:11.050 --> 00:58:15.631]  I did a little research on these modern church leaders, and they're nothing but...
[00:58:19.602 --> 00:58:20.583]  Well, I agree with you.
[00:58:20.683 --> 00:58:23.484]  And they're there to tell you, lay down, do nothing, everything's fine.
[00:58:23.504 --> 00:58:24.784]  Oh, great, stuff's getting worse.
[00:58:24.824 --> 00:58:26.405]  That means Jesus is coming soon.
[00:58:27.285 --> 00:58:31.007]  And evil's taking over and doing horrible things.
[00:58:31.087 --> 00:58:33.348]  And they're just smiling.
[00:58:33.928 --> 00:58:34.868]  Oh, my preacher.
[00:58:34.888 --> 00:58:36.789]  Drives a big Cadillac.
[00:58:36.829 --> 00:58:38.330]  I'm going to give him my money.
[00:58:41.576 --> 00:58:46.240]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:58.032 --> 00:58:58.692]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.352 --> 00:59:00.393]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.113 --> 00:59:02.233]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.874 --> 00:59:03.674]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.434 --> 00:59:05.335]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.015 --> 00:59:09.676]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.196 --> 00:59:14.258]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.052 --> 00:59:19.274]  Already into the second hour.
[00:59:19.414 --> 00:59:21.336]  Wide open phones today.
[00:59:21.396 --> 00:59:22.517]  Toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:22.537 --> 00:59:22.597]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:22.617 --> 00:59:23.618]  I want to hear from you today.
[00:59:23.638 --> 00:59:27.121]  In the last hour, I got into a report about, well, just two cases in Texas.
[00:59:27.141 --> 00:59:28.682]  You make a $650 payment on your credit card.
[00:59:46.477 --> 00:59:52.025]  And then, well, Homeland Security comes and stops the payment and starts investigating you.
[00:59:52.045 --> 00:59:54.748]  You see every prescription you make, everything you do.
[00:59:54.808 --> 00:59:56.110]  It's all instantly uploaded.
[00:59:56.430 --> 00:59:57.232]  No Fourth Amendment.
[00:59:58.033 --> 00:59:59.715]  No even shadow of a Bill of Rights.
[01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:01.741]  So that's the reality.
[01:00:02.121 --> 01:00:06.144]  They'll have a national debate about intercepting bin Laden's phone calls.
[01:00:06.184 --> 01:00:06.784]  Give me a break.
[01:00:07.065 --> 01:00:08.586]  And that's the backdrop to all of this.
[01:00:08.606 --> 01:00:09.586]  And another big story here.
[01:00:09.947 --> 01:00:11.788]  Meet the world's most dangerous terrorist.
[01:00:12.348 --> 01:00:17.352]  They go to prison for having battery chargers, Casio washes, and peanut oil.
[01:00:17.372 --> 01:00:20.774]  And then another article I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:00:20.834 --> 01:00:23.556]  Revised Patriot Act targets allergy cold meds.
[01:00:24.857 --> 01:00:27.539]  Students questioned by Secret Service for heckling Clinton.
[01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:36.237]  That high school teacher's been suspended now because of the evil of speaking out and telling our government what it is.
[01:00:37.398 --> 01:00:41.241]  But right now, let's go ahead and go back to your calls.
[01:00:42.022 --> 01:00:44.003]  Let's go ahead and talk to Alex in mass.
[01:00:44.063 --> 01:00:44.704]  Welcome, Alex.
[01:00:50.488 --> 01:00:51.229]  Alrighty then.
[01:00:51.309 --> 01:00:52.029]  He's gone.
[01:00:52.110 --> 01:00:52.950]  Mark in Texas.
[01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:53.671]  You're on the air.
[01:00:53.731 --> 01:00:54.071]  Welcome.
[01:00:55.952 --> 01:00:56.413]  Are you with me?
[01:00:57.245 --> 01:00:59.306]  Yeah, we just went to your call, sir.
[01:01:01.067 --> 01:01:05.068]  Okay, well, I want to ask you directly.
[01:01:09.650 --> 01:01:13.812]  Sir, you called about a month ago and said the same thing, and no, I didn't.
[01:01:14.452 --> 01:01:14.852]  Okay.
[01:01:15.292 --> 01:01:16.073]  Thank you for your call.
[01:01:16.133 --> 01:01:20.695]  I told you that that was a lie, and you don't care, so you call right back in with it.
[01:01:21.435 --> 01:01:23.856]  And let me just say this, folks.
[01:01:25.191 --> 01:01:27.912]  There are a lot of bad things that are said about Alex Jones.
[01:01:29.192 --> 01:01:40.476]  And either the government provocateurs, idiots, to believe their stories, and that's what happened in this case, and then it's picked up by government operatives to go out and spread lies about me.
[01:01:41.257 --> 01:01:41.977]  It doesn't matter.
[01:01:41.997 --> 01:01:46.939]  The stuff that's said about me, 98% of it, isn't true.
[01:01:47.439 --> 01:01:50.940]  Most of it is whole cloth fabrications.
[01:01:52.851 --> 01:02:04.457]  And I let that guy call in a month ago and say the exact same thing, the same horrible, sad, weak voice, and let him say it again, and I'm just not going to sit here and go along with it.
[01:02:04.477 --> 01:02:06.638]  You see, I'm trying to cover issues.
[01:02:08.219 --> 01:02:11.160]  I'm trying to rally the people to deal with issues.
[01:02:11.721 --> 01:02:18.244]  And the globalists are confident that they can just run their COINTELPRO off.
[01:02:18.264 --> 01:02:22.326]  If you don't know what that is, just type it into Google COINTELPRO, and then you can go find out about it.
[01:02:22.825 --> 01:02:26.928]  How they get us to fight with each other, how they lie about people that are getting a good job done.
[01:02:27.248 --> 01:02:32.332]  I ought to be glad, though, I'm getting this, instead of just the blood which is blowing my head off or framing me for something.
[01:02:32.352 --> 01:02:33.553]  And who knows, that might happen.
[01:02:33.974 --> 01:02:36.195]  Certainly they've told me that's going to happen if I don't shut up.
[01:02:36.215 --> 01:02:37.136]  But I'm not going to shut up.
[01:02:37.957 --> 01:02:38.357]  Okay?
[01:02:38.497 --> 01:02:40.979]  But it's really that simple.
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:46.843]  And there is no way to... And I always have to answer these questions.
[01:02:46.903 --> 01:02:48.825]  It's like yesterday, I get this call I get every week.
[01:02:49.364 --> 01:02:49.724]  Why?
[01:02:49.744 --> 01:02:50.605]  This stuff's true.
[01:02:50.625 --> 01:02:51.646]  Why are you still alive?
[01:02:51.766 --> 01:02:52.807]  Number one, because of God.
[01:02:53.367 --> 01:02:54.768]  Number two is they don't want to make me a martyr.
[01:02:55.168 --> 01:02:57.070]  And it just goes down the line from there.
[01:02:57.830 --> 01:02:59.691]  A lot of people in government are good folks.
[01:03:00.592 --> 01:03:02.053]  All right, now we're going to break here.
[01:03:02.313 --> 01:03:04.855]  And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to come back and cover news.
[01:03:05.756 --> 01:03:12.120]  We'll just do that for a while because I try to balance this out between covering news, taking your calls.
[01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:13.141]  We get a lot of great calls.
[01:03:13.181 --> 01:03:14.382]  We also get a lot of weird ones.
[01:03:15.296 --> 01:03:24.445]  And I like the type of callers that bring up news items, that bring up issues, or add to what I've already covered, or that genuinely disagree with me, or genuinely agree, or have a real question.
[01:03:25.206 --> 01:03:26.147]  That's always nice.
[01:03:29.436 --> 01:03:29.616]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:30.256 --> 01:03:41.106]  I'll come back and get into some new developments on the Iran front, some of the attacks on the First Amendment here in the United States, and a lot more.
[01:03:41.506 --> 01:03:45.750]  The websites are Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:03:53.812 --> 01:04:00.637]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:04:00.958 --> 01:04:02.339]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:04:02.519 --> 01:04:04.721]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:04.881 --> 01:04:06.962]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:07.243 --> 01:04:12.187]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:12.507 --> 01:04:16.550]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:16.790 --> 01:04:18.571]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:04:18.651 --> 01:04:29.293]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and planable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.433 --> 01:04:31.354]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:04:31.554 --> 01:04:35.415]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[01:04:35.495 --> 01:04:36.935]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[01:04:36.975 --> 01:04:37.155]  That's 888-2533-139.
[01:04:43.877 --> 01:04:47.584]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[01:04:47.865 --> 01:04:48.646]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[01:04:54.693 --> 01:04:59.196]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:04:59.536 --> 01:05:03.618]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:05:03.918 --> 01:05:04.479]  We listened.
[01:05:04.779 --> 01:05:09.762]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:05:10.022 --> 01:05:10.522]  We listened.
[01:05:10.903 --> 01:05:13.944]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:05:14.365 --> 01:05:14.885]  We listened.
[01:05:15.425 --> 01:05:16.025]  We're good to go.
[01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:46.245]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[01:05:46.265 --> 01:05:47.890]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:53.672 --> 01:05:58.313]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[01:05:58.353 --> 01:05:59.093]  have diabetes.
[01:05:59.413 --> 01:06:06.374]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[01:06:06.514 --> 01:06:11.035]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[01:06:11.235 --> 01:06:14.056]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[01:06:58.358 --> 01:06:59.019]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.659 --> 01:07:00.779]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.439 --> 01:07:02.579]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.599 --> 01:07:04.040]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:06.700]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:10.301]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.521 --> 01:07:14.642]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:14.862 --> 01:07:15.702]  Music
[01:07:20.310 --> 01:07:21.851]  Alright, your calls are coming up.
[01:07:21.911 --> 01:07:25.373]  Let me right now just run through a lot of the important news today.
[01:07:29.996 --> 01:07:31.457]  First off, let's get into this.
[01:07:31.477 --> 01:07:34.459]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:39.002]  Revised Patriot Act targets allergy and cold meds.
[01:07:39.823 --> 01:07:42.284]  Thought the Patriot Act dealt with terrorists.
[01:07:43.005 --> 01:07:45.426]  All crime, all misdemeanor is terrorism.
[01:07:45.466 --> 01:07:46.447]  We are all terrorists.
[01:07:46.869 --> 01:07:47.289]  Listen.
[01:07:47.309 --> 01:07:47.489]  Listen.
[01:08:16.869 --> 01:08:20.852]  I probably only have to take it about a month out of the year, but Sudafed works really well.
[01:08:22.973 --> 01:08:24.114]  And we have real bad allergies.
[01:08:24.194 --> 01:08:26.196]  Austin's the capital of this here in the U.S.
[01:08:26.616 --> 01:08:31.800]  And I went into a pharmacy, and they don't have it on the counter anymore.
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:34.722]  And so I went and said, go to the pharmacist.
[01:08:34.802 --> 01:08:38.004]  And I go to the pharmacist, and she goes, all right, I need your ID card.
[01:08:38.024 --> 01:08:38.785]  I need you to sign here.
[01:08:38.805 --> 01:08:39.605]  I need to fill it out.
[01:08:39.625 --> 01:08:41.947]  And I was getting 10 pills.
[01:08:43.178 --> 01:08:45.059]  And she said, it's state law.
[01:08:45.079 --> 01:08:46.380]  And I said, let me see the state law.
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:48.261]  And she goes, actually, I'll give that to you.
[01:08:48.281 --> 01:08:49.382]  She goes, I think this is really dumb.
[01:08:49.923 --> 01:08:50.743]  She gets it out for me.
[01:08:50.763 --> 01:08:51.924]  I don't have to do an article about it.
[01:08:51.944 --> 01:08:52.804]  Put it in my car.
[01:08:52.864 --> 01:08:53.565]  I never did anything with it.
[01:08:54.005 --> 01:08:56.507]  She gave me Xerox copy of it, photocopy of it.
[01:08:56.527 --> 01:08:58.108]  It wasn't a law.
[01:08:58.548 --> 01:09:00.209]  It was a regulation.
[01:09:01.230 --> 01:09:03.792]  Just like this animal ID tagging and premises tagging.
[01:09:03.812 --> 01:09:06.493]  Going to have a guest in soon on that.
[01:09:06.613 --> 01:09:07.294]  Federal law.
[01:09:08.218 --> 01:09:13.101]  And it isn't a law you've got to do it, but it's a federal law that it's a regulation to basically force you to.
[01:09:13.981 --> 01:09:18.504]  And we're talking tracker chips in all the animals, a $10 chip on a $5 chicken.
[01:09:20.345 --> 01:09:24.467]  We're talking about asking permission when you leave with your horses out your front gate.
[01:09:24.868 --> 01:09:26.649]  We're talking satellite watching you.
[01:09:27.289 --> 01:09:28.530]  I mean, total control.
[01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:29.350]  We're all prisoners.
[01:09:29.711 --> 01:09:30.831]  Border stays wide open then.
[01:09:31.171 --> 01:09:35.594]  Foreign food gets shipped in with absolutely no inspection to speak of.
[01:09:37.388 --> 01:09:38.149]  And it goes on.
[01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:44.113]  Beginning September 30th, it'll take a flash of an ID to buy the medication.
[01:09:44.153 --> 01:09:45.473]  It was always federal push.
[01:09:45.493 --> 01:09:48.375]  The feds write legislation, try to pass it federally.
[01:09:48.395 --> 01:09:54.719]  If they have trouble, as they did two years ago with the Patriot Act expansion, they then just go pay off the local legislatures to do it.
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:56.561]  And a bunch of states are now doing this.
[01:09:57.341 --> 01:10:03.125]  But already, folks, that's just a preparing for the national ID card, swiping ID for all purchases.
[01:10:04.313 --> 01:10:07.614]  Already, again, they're going to have a national ID card with a sales tax.
[01:10:07.634 --> 01:10:08.275]  They're going to do that.
[01:10:09.315 --> 01:10:13.316]  And all of your prescriptions behind the counter is already instantly uploaded.
[01:10:13.416 --> 01:10:15.057]  So that will be entered in the computer as well.
[01:10:15.737 --> 01:10:21.639]  Legislation sponsored by Senator Dianne Feinstein and Jim Talent, Republican, Missouri.
[01:10:21.979 --> 01:10:26.521]  Feinstein, of course, Democrat, would blanket the nation with one policy.
[01:10:26.561 --> 01:10:28.061]  See, policy.
[01:10:29.102 --> 01:10:32.483]  Not a law, it's a policy that would put medicines containing drugs
[01:10:34.358 --> 01:10:35.319]  I can't pronounce it.
[01:10:35.539 --> 01:10:40.821]  Pseudo-Phedrine behind the counter and out of the reach of meth cooks.
[01:10:43.383 --> 01:10:47.324]  See, first, about two years ago, they just said, oh, it's a regulation of policy.
[01:10:48.485 --> 01:10:51.386]  We don't want you to be able to buy more than two boxes.
[01:10:51.406 --> 01:10:53.447]  So they had to cut out the sales.
[01:10:54.608 --> 01:10:57.509]  And then they said, oh, you can just buy one box.
[01:10:57.569 --> 01:11:00.391]  And then, oh, we're going to make you swipe your card.
[01:11:01.997 --> 01:11:11.359]  If we leave it up to local jurisdiction, we're simply going to move the problem from one jurisdiction to another without addressing the root cause, said President of California Police Chief Jerry Dreyer.
[01:11:11.379 --> 01:11:13.200]  So see, we've got to have federal control.
[01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:15.120]  We can't have this whole thing called jurisdiction.
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:21.282]  Passed the standard local law, cracking down on methamphetamine production, set off a cycle that goes something like this.
[01:11:22.262 --> 01:11:28.023]  The black market price of cold tablets needed to make the drugs skyrocket, driving the makers to the jurisdiction next door.
[01:11:28.463 --> 01:11:31.504]  There, they buy it in bulk, legally, cheaply, and anonymously.
[01:11:32.159 --> 01:11:36.363]  That is, until the state or city gets tough on meth with new laws of its own.
[01:11:36.663 --> 01:11:49.713]  Meanwhile, they have 10 million children in America on Ritalin and Fetamin-type drugs whose molecules are actually more dangerous in major medical studies than this.
[01:11:50.894 --> 01:11:57.800]  And Bush, right after he signed the Real ID Act, signed the New Freedom Initiative.
[01:11:57.940 --> 01:11:58.941]  Ah, yes, the New Freedom.
[01:12:00.122 --> 01:12:01.043]  And what does that do?
[01:12:02.851 --> 01:12:07.499]  Well, the drug company's own documents got released a year before they even passed it last year, so now two years ago.
[01:12:08.343 --> 01:12:26.832]  And it openly said, it was his executives, their own minutes of the meetings, one of their own people went public with it up in Ohio, thank God, and it didn't stop it, and it said, we've got 10% of the children and over 10% of the adults on these drugs now, we will go in the next five years, if implemented, to 50% and then beyond.
[01:12:27.252 --> 01:12:33.315]  We will forcibly put through the school and law enforcement half of the children on our products.
[01:12:34.452 --> 01:12:42.983]  I mean, they openly say they're going to put the children, half of them on it, and now Illinois, Texas, and others are implementing this at the state level.
[01:12:43.844 --> 01:12:46.768]  I mean, you couldn't write a science fiction horror movie this bad.
[01:12:47.589 --> 01:12:48.210]  This is THX 1138.
[01:12:48.250 --> 01:12:49.051]  This is the Brave New World.
[01:12:54.318 --> 01:12:54.819]  We're good to go.
[01:12:54.859 --> 01:12:54.999]  I think?
[01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:13.321]  Unless, of course, it's from your prison labor, laboring in the prisons the drug dealers openly own.
[01:13:13.361 --> 01:13:13.962]  We've done articles.
[01:13:14.022 --> 01:13:15.142]  It's been in the news.
[01:13:15.182 --> 01:13:20.643]  It's been in major watchdog groups that big cartel-linked banks openly own most of the prisons.
[01:13:20.984 --> 01:13:23.864]  Just want to add that each hour for you so you understand how this works.
[01:13:24.124 --> 01:13:27.085]  But they don't get the profit from the drug itself up front.
[01:13:27.665 --> 01:13:28.866]  So they really hate marijuana.
[01:13:29.706 --> 01:13:31.526]  And then methamphetamine, which is very destructive.
[01:13:31.546 --> 01:13:33.527]  You know, in the 60s, they spray-painted on the walls.
[01:13:34.027 --> 01:13:34.647]  Speed kills.
[01:13:34.687 --> 01:13:35.127]  And it does.
[01:13:35.187 --> 01:13:35.748]  It's horrible.
[01:13:36.048 --> 01:13:36.848]  Makes you a lunatic.
[01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:44.579]  So what have they done to the million troops that have rotated in and out of Afghanistan, Iraq, and Europe in the last four years?
[01:13:45.761 --> 01:13:51.649]  Big national numbers have come out on that, showing that around 20% routinely take the pet pills.
[01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:52.871]  They're encouraged to.
[01:13:54.910 --> 01:14:05.220]  And the head futurist at the Army, Dr. Marshall, in a Wired Magazine cover story a few years ago, said, in the future it won't be what weapons we have, but what drugs our soldiers are on.
[01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:15.169]  And so they're serving up a cocktail, not just of speed, oh no, not just the meth, but they're serving up other goodies.
[01:14:16.417 --> 01:14:20.900]  Amnesiacs, pleasure drugs, you name it, for aftermission, for battle fatigue.
[01:14:21.261 --> 01:14:22.041]  Addicting the troops.
[01:14:22.061 --> 01:14:23.022]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[01:14:23.042 --> 01:14:32.709]  And then once you're on the streets, the government will serve up these similar synthetic drugs, designer drugs, sold by the drug companies themselves, who sold to the Pentagon to begin with.
[01:14:32.789 --> 01:14:34.470]  It's a fabulous new market.
[01:14:35.583 --> 01:14:42.791]  And then your 14-year-old son or daughter goes to that party for the first time and takes one of the designer pills and ends up being addicted.
[01:14:43.412 --> 01:14:47.977]  And if they weren't smart enough to go get it from a doctor, of course they'll eat holes in their brains, that's okay.
[01:14:48.237 --> 01:14:50.240]  Maybe cause them to commit suicide or kill others.
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:15:08.715]  But if they're caught using the exact same molecule under a street name, you're going to serve two years in prison and come out with gang tattoos on you, maybe with HIV or hepatitis, and now you'll be in with a group of people that rob stores and counterfeit money, and you would have gone to prison, gone to college.
[01:15:08.875 --> 01:15:19.584]  Oh, and then you rob people's houses, the dumb public calls for more cops, and then the very drug-dealing cartels own the major companies supplying the police and running the surveillance systems.
[01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:21.309]  I'm not kidding.
[01:15:21.349 --> 01:15:22.770]  This is how it works, okay?
[01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:25.351]  This is how it works.
[01:15:28.872 --> 01:15:38.835]  And so I, two or three times a year, go staggering, literally, with incredible sinus headache, into the Walgreens and shuffle up to the counter.
[01:15:41.836 --> 01:15:43.277]  We'll have to fill out the form.
[01:15:44.458 --> 01:15:45.960]  It just trains us to do this.
[01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:52.006]  And they're openly saying, buy too much coffee, buy too much beer, buy too much Blue Bell ice cream, buy too much red meat.
[01:15:52.367 --> 01:15:59.014]  The bureaucrats at the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture, all public, just go to their websites.
[01:15:59.434 --> 01:16:02.798]  When you swipe the national ID card with your nice state certified on it,
[01:16:03.538 --> 01:16:07.300]  When you swipe it with part of your new graduated sales tax, to be fair, the poor won't have to pay.
[01:16:08.021 --> 01:16:09.722]  Oh, we show you're eating too much.
[01:16:09.962 --> 01:16:11.803]  Oh, that goes on your insurance now.
[01:16:12.203 --> 01:16:14.684]  Oh, you're going to get social worker visits.
[01:16:15.024 --> 01:16:15.705]  Oh, you don't believe me?
[01:16:15.745 --> 01:16:16.705]  It's already begun.
[01:16:16.725 --> 01:16:22.028]  They're already buying credit card data and showing you're buying too much beer.
[01:16:22.448 --> 01:16:23.929]  And then you get your license revoked.
[01:16:23.969 --> 01:16:24.469]  Oh, don't believe me?
[01:16:24.509 --> 01:16:25.910]  That was Associated Press last year.
[01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:27.131]  Oh, yes!
[01:16:27.958 --> 01:16:32.042]  Are you getting an idea of the type of world this is?
[01:16:32.382 --> 01:16:39.748]  I mean, I just read where you pay off a $650 credit card bill and Homeland Security flags you and starts watching you.
[01:16:40.329 --> 01:16:42.931]  You've got a name like Johnson or a name like Booth.
[01:16:44.212 --> 01:16:48.475]  And again, I'm not saying, some people misunderstand and go, what, you don't care about Arabs or Hispanics?
[01:16:48.575 --> 01:16:49.937]  No, no, no.
[01:16:50.157 --> 01:16:51.378]  Imagine how bad it is for them.
[01:16:52.697 --> 01:17:00.904]  Because even when somebody's got a Hispanic surname, a Spanish surname, these dummies at airport security wearing giant turbans usually, don't even know.
[01:17:00.924 --> 01:17:02.125]  It's just ridiculous.
[01:17:02.546 --> 01:17:13.816]  But the point is, even if Muslims are supposedly terrorists, which they are, it's totally staged, it just shows how they're constantly harassing blonde-haired, blue-eyed, 75-year-old women.
[01:17:15.457 --> 01:17:16.758]  I mean, I've been at the airports, folks.
[01:17:16.838 --> 01:17:17.359]  I've seen...
[01:17:18.639 --> 01:17:27.728]  Old people who are 90 years old in a semi-catatonic state stumbling, fighting as hard as they can, going to see family or going to some war memorial.
[01:17:27.748 --> 01:17:29.229]  I mean, I've talked to them.
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:34.121]  And there'll be foreigners gibbering and jabbering in commando outfits.
[01:17:34.221 --> 01:17:36.782]  One of them was called Wolverine Security in San Francisco.
[01:17:37.202 --> 01:17:42.004]  Jabbing and griping at some old person who's got bloodshot eyes, can barely stand up on the walker.
[01:17:42.204 --> 01:17:48.106]  They're just crying their neck off in pure pain while some piece of trash gets in their face.
[01:17:48.606 --> 01:17:51.767]  It makes me very angry, and I'm sick of it.
[01:17:51.967 --> 01:17:54.368]  I'm sick of you, scum government!
[01:17:55.859 --> 01:18:04.121]  Just some person near death battling to go visit family, battling to keep living, battling to live in America, home of the...
[01:18:04.947 --> 01:18:10.711]  Land of the free, home of the brave, now home of the trash slaves, prodded and controlled by foreigners.
[01:18:11.151 --> 01:18:20.278]  Our entire cabinet of the Bush administration are all basically foreign registered agents of Israel and England and every other foreign country.
[01:18:20.698 --> 01:18:28.804]  We're totally sold out with mindless, stupid, grueling police who don't even know what America is out there enforcing all of this.
[01:18:28.824 --> 01:18:31.746]  All right, I'm sorry.
[01:18:34.224 --> 01:18:40.008]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:40.029 --> 01:18:43.091]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:01.348 --> 01:19:09.210]  The best kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:09.451 --> 01:19:12.091]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed, Inc.'
[01:19:12.051 --> 01:19:13.472]  's patented methodology.
[01:19:13.632 --> 01:19:16.993]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation,

[01:22:53.976 --> 01:22:59.618]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:02.239 --> 01:23:05.360]  Government is not reason, it is not eloquence, it is force.
[01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:10.102]  Like fire, it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master, George Washington.
[01:23:11.002 --> 01:23:23.488]  Woe to those who decree unjust statutes and to those who continually record unjust decisions, who deprive the needy of justice and to rob the poor of my people of their rights, Isaiah.
[01:23:25.630 --> 01:23:29.592]  Taking the plunge, my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.
[01:23:30.272 --> 01:23:33.454]  The only thing necessary for evil to triumph is that good men do nothing.
[01:23:33.494 --> 01:23:34.254]  That was Edmund Burke.
[01:23:35.169 --> 01:23:48.732]  Second Chronicles, if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land.
[01:23:48.792 --> 01:23:55.373]  You know, reading so many of these quotes, I'm here looking at the Citizen Rule book, the best I've found out there.
[01:23:55.393 --> 01:23:58.974]  There's a lot of different Citizen Rule books, little pamphlets, but this is the best.
[01:23:58.994 --> 01:24:01.295]  And I said 90 pages, it's actually 62 pages.
[01:24:03.502 --> 01:24:06.905]  Long, and it's such an important little booklet, and we are carrying it now.
[01:24:07.605 --> 01:24:09.827]  I was growling and sounding hateful earlier.
[01:24:09.907 --> 01:24:10.448]  I am hateful.
[01:24:10.948 --> 01:24:12.069]  I hate scum.
[01:24:12.129 --> 01:24:12.690]  I hate tyrants.
[01:24:12.730 --> 01:24:13.230]  I hate bullies.
[01:24:13.250 --> 01:24:15.272]  I was trying not to scream.
[01:24:15.312 --> 01:24:19.315]  I was trying to control myself because the things I've seen are just so sick.
[01:24:19.335 --> 01:24:29.283]  And to be a free human being and to know that we're all going into serious bondage, I mean hardcore bondage, and to know how much our forefathers struggled for us to have a little bit of freedom.
[01:24:30.106 --> 01:24:38.530]  And to see high-tech shackles that have been forged being placed on us and to watch the giggling, gibbering public just smiling about it, it's upsetting.
[01:24:39.630 --> 01:24:40.350]  It's very upsetting.
[01:24:40.370 --> 01:24:41.251]  Let's go to your calls.
[01:24:42.892 --> 01:24:44.372]  Fred, you're on the air.
[01:24:44.432 --> 01:24:44.872]  Go ahead.
[01:24:44.892 --> 01:24:46.433]  Hi, Alex.
[01:24:47.073 --> 01:24:47.333]  Hi.
[01:24:48.334 --> 01:24:52.836]  I want to ask you this question before I go on to the next thing.
[01:24:52.876 --> 01:24:57.278]  Who's the founder and the seller of Domino's Pizza who...
[01:24:58.644 --> 01:25:00.826]  Is a good ally.
[01:25:02.747 --> 01:25:04.528]  He's got an Italian last name I forget.
[01:25:04.568 --> 01:25:06.409]  He sent me news articles with him in it.
[01:25:06.429 --> 01:25:07.530]  I've seen him on TV.
[01:25:07.550 --> 01:25:10.432]  I know folks in Michigan that know him.
[01:25:10.492 --> 01:25:11.633]  Joe or John?
[01:25:12.093 --> 01:25:13.654]  Yeah, and I can't... He's a listener.
[01:25:14.155 --> 01:25:16.396]  I can't quite... He and his brother founded it.
[01:25:17.057 --> 01:25:20.539]  And just... You caught me off guard.
[01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:22.841]  It might pop in my head later.
[01:25:22.961 --> 01:25:23.862]  Yeah, okay.
[01:25:24.282 --> 01:25:24.362]  Um...
[01:25:26.157 --> 01:25:49.774]  One of the things I wanted to tell you was I looked up this gentleman, Clay Lowry, this very, very devious character over at the Treasury Department who's head of the, not formally head of the CFIS committee, but I think he's head of the push to decide secretly the ports deal.
[01:25:50.795 --> 01:25:53.657]  And you're not going to believe what job he had before that.
[01:25:54.594 --> 01:26:01.480]  He was the Director of International Debt Policy at the Treasury Department.
[01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:08.887]  Well, sir, the Treasury Secretary is the head of the federal body that signed off on the deal when he did a $1.15 billion deal with...
[01:26:12.777 --> 01:26:14.058]  We're good to go.
[01:26:35.078 --> 01:26:40.683]  The Sheik himself, and then we have Jeb and Marvin and Neil.
[01:26:40.703 --> 01:26:41.684]  They're all in business.
[01:26:41.764 --> 01:26:43.085]  It's all a conflict of interest.
[01:26:43.425 --> 01:26:44.266]  It's all illegal.
[01:26:45.647 --> 01:26:49.110]  Yeah, and the process is... But don't worry.
[01:26:49.130 --> 01:26:54.094]  When you go get some cold medicine, we're going to write your name down and scan your driver's license.
[01:26:54.114 --> 01:26:59.138]  The process is as big a story as anything because this will happen.
[01:26:59.218 --> 01:27:01.860]  Other things will happen with the same kind of process.
[01:27:02.287 --> 01:27:06.093]  We've had a lateral movement of these people from think tanks.
[01:27:06.814 --> 01:27:10.098]  The entire infrastructure is being sold out right now.
[01:27:10.459 --> 01:27:17.169]  Right, but there's also people from the think tanks are moving laterally without having to go before Congress or anybody else.
[01:27:17.662 --> 01:27:19.623]  They're moving right into power positions.
[01:27:20.023 --> 01:27:29.327]  Yeah, the executive has declared the power to make law and enforce law by fiat, and it is now creating massive, what, 30-something new agencies.
[01:27:29.787 --> 01:27:30.328]  And you're right.
[01:27:30.348 --> 01:27:31.808]  They're putting their people in command everywhere.
[01:27:31.828 --> 01:27:44.774]  Yeah, and the people who are above them in the bureaucracy are not in a position to block what they're doing because these people, like the SEVIS committee staff...
[01:27:45.515 --> 01:27:49.396]  Have incredible power that other people are not even aware of.
[01:27:49.436 --> 01:27:50.416]  Well, yeah, it's simple.
[01:27:50.456 --> 01:27:54.277]  Let's say old bureaucracies won't follow unconstitutional orders.
[01:27:54.337 --> 01:27:57.758]  They just cut their funding, build a new agency, and put it over them.
[01:27:59.159 --> 01:28:14.183]  Now, the other thing I wanted to... This is kind of shifting gears, but I think this kind of ties into what you were saying, and you might want to do an analysis of this, is that the political independents and the people who are patriots who are wealthy...
[01:28:15.043 --> 01:28:23.626]  I think they're not really being called on to divide up what they can do best with their money and with their time.
[01:28:24.026 --> 01:28:26.607]  Like, for example, Kathleen Keating.
[01:28:26.727 --> 01:28:35.891]  I think that's that woman in West Virginia that had that horrible battle with the bureaucracy, and she lives in West Virginia now, and she spent about $6 million.
[01:28:36.751 --> 01:28:40.252]  Jimmy Walter, the guy... I see where you're going.
[01:28:40.272 --> 01:28:41.313]  I'm going to move on to other callers.
[01:28:41.333 --> 01:28:41.913]  Thanks for the call.
[01:28:44.261 --> 01:28:45.143]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.643 --> 01:28:47.266]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.187 --> 01:28:50.852]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.897 --> 01:28:58.340]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[01:28:58.620 --> 01:29:02.203]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[01:29:02.343 --> 01:29:10.489]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[01:29:10.729 --> 01:29:16.353]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[01:29:16.653 --> 01:29:21.897]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time, your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[01:29:22.157 --> 01:29:24.239]  This is why you need the filter mag.
[01:29:24.519 --> 01:29:36.669]  The filter mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[01:29:36.909 --> 01:29:41.313]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[01:29:41.533 --> 01:29:42.494]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:29:42.674 --> 01:29:44.296]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[01:29:44.416 --> 01:29:46.217]  That's FilterMag.com.
[01:29:46.478 --> 01:29:46.938]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[01:29:46.958 --> 01:29:47.158]  That's 800-345-8376.
[01:29:54.202 --> 01:29:58.086]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:29:58.326 --> 01:30:03.771]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:30:04.031 --> 01:30:14.401]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:30:14.581 --> 01:30:18.905]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:30:19.105 --> 01:30:27.447]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[01:30:27.727 --> 01:30:34.089]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[01:30:34.189 --> 01:30:38.670]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:30:38.890 --> 01:30:43.112]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[01:30:43.472 --> 01:30:47.773]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-
[01:30:48.533 --> 01:30:56.259]  Ever wish your kid came with an instruction manual?

[01:31:18.595 --> 01:31:18.815]  1-800-373-0402.
[01:31:18.835 --> 01:31:31.143]  When my son started having behavior problems, the Total Transformation techniques were like the instruction manual on how to deal with him.
[01:31:31.383 --> 01:31:32.684]  We got immediate results.
[01:31:33.164 --> 01:31:35.266]  Do you need an instruction manual for your kid?
[01:31:35.726 --> 01:31:44.013]  I'm behavioral therapist James Lehman, and I'll show you how to change your child's behavior now with the Total Transformation, the program that helps stop defiance and backtalking.
[01:31:44.253 --> 01:31:45.594]  Your child will listen to you again.
[01:31:45.614 --> 01:31:46.514]  I guarantee it.
[01:31:46.755 --> 01:31:47.195]  Call now.
[01:31:47.215 --> 01:31:47.275]  1-800-373-0402.
[01:31:47.295 --> 01:31:47.615]  1-800-373-0402.
[01:31:47.655 --> 01:31:48.836]  I'm going to be honest with the last caller.
[01:31:48.856 --> 01:31:50.678]  You know, he brought up an important point.
[01:32:03.354 --> 01:32:04.055]  Fred and Philly.
[01:32:04.075 --> 01:32:07.057]  And we're going to go to others that are patiently holding.
[01:32:07.077 --> 01:32:09.779]  Let me just be honest with you.
[01:32:09.839 --> 01:32:11.720]  You know, I don't get up here and ask for money.
[01:32:13.802 --> 01:32:24.610]  Because I believe listeners, if they want to support what we're doing, should donate by, say, calling it buying 100 Road to Tyrannies or 100 Martial Laws.
[01:32:25.931 --> 01:32:29.133]  Because then you'll get them an incredible discount, by the way.
[01:32:29.153 --> 01:32:29.814]  Wholesale.
[01:32:30.854 --> 01:32:33.395]  Then you'll know some good's being done with it.
[01:32:34.316 --> 01:32:40.839]  You'll know you'll have something you can give to people, and it puts you into the frame of mind of not counting on somebody else to do it.
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:51.285]  Not that I'm saying it's bad to donate to people, but it puts you in the mindset of you're the one actually out planting the apple seeds, planting the mustard seeds.
[01:32:53.206 --> 01:32:55.567]  And then you know that it's now been put in your hands.
[01:32:55.667 --> 01:32:58.389]  You know that you're supporting somebody who's doing...
[01:32:59.415 --> 01:33:00.036]  A good job.
[01:33:00.416 --> 01:33:01.317]  Fighting the New World Order.
[01:33:03.099 --> 01:33:07.783]  But also, you know you're getting a material that's very effective where you're sure it's getting out.
[01:33:07.843 --> 01:33:10.225]  So you get the best of both worlds.
[01:33:13.428 --> 01:33:16.131]  I grew up in a nice middle class neighborhood.
[01:33:16.151 --> 01:33:18.113]  You know, my dad was a dentist in Dallas.
[01:33:18.173 --> 01:33:22.297]  And then I finished high school up down here the last two years in Austin, Texas.
[01:33:24.426 --> 01:33:27.109]  And, you know, we grew up in the nice little neighborhood.
[01:33:27.129 --> 01:33:32.515]  I mean, our house was small compared to Moe's little four-bedroom house, but it was in, you know, the gated community with the golf course.
[01:33:32.535 --> 01:33:37.221]  And there were some ten-bedroom houses plus in the neighborhood, you know, really nice houses.
[01:33:38.112 --> 01:33:45.637]  And in our neighborhood there were a gaggle of preachers, of the famous Dallas-type preachers.
[01:33:45.657 --> 01:33:46.537]  I'm not going to say any names.
[01:33:46.877 --> 01:33:51.280]  I've said names, people especially from Texas, the people that watch TBM and know who I was talking about.
[01:33:51.300 --> 01:33:56.623]  Of course, they all had houses on the beach and in Florida and in Colorado and in downtown Dallas.
[01:33:56.683 --> 01:34:03.587]  I mean, you know, the five- and ten-bedroom houses with swimming pools and two giant decks and stuff.
[01:34:03.927 --> 01:34:06.529]  That was just, you know, in our neighborhood was just one of their houses.
[01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:17.592]  I mean, by the time I was 14, their kids were bad influences on drugs and rock and roll bands, bringing in the girls.
[01:34:18.253 --> 01:34:23.074]  I mean, by the time I moved out of there when I was about 16, they were wild in the streets.
[01:34:23.834 --> 01:34:31.937]  And I'd watch the preacher pull up in his brand new Jaguar, and he'd have two Cadillacs in the garage, and he'd scumble out drunk and fall on the pavement singing tequila.
[01:34:32.337 --> 01:34:34.058]  I'd be out on the balcony of my parents' house,
[01:34:34.983 --> 01:34:56.939]  You know, sitting there, it was out by Lake Ray Hubbard out on the lake, and just stumbling around drunk going, and this is a famous preacher, and I remember even going to church with him sometimes when I was even smaller, maybe six, seven, eight years old, and I'm up there begging, I know if you're a widow and you don't think you have any money still, just give it, give that last bag of beans.
[01:35:00.061 --> 01:35:02.202]  It's like the widow and the cooking oil.
[01:35:03.243 --> 01:35:04.444]  So I saw that, and so,
[01:35:06.098 --> 01:35:12.760]  I know a lot of the Patriot Freedom Talk shows ask for money, and I'm not saying it's bad that they do, but that's a dead-end road for me.
[01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:14.820]  And I just don't do it.
[01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:25.703]  But then I hear other people who are doing it on other networks, other places, whether it's good, bad, or indifferent, and I think, man, my gosh, if I'm being associated with this, I might as well ask for money.
[01:35:25.763 --> 01:35:27.103]  But let me tell you how you donate to us.
[01:35:27.990 --> 01:35:29.311]  You own a local business.
[01:35:29.351 --> 01:35:29.971]  Help yourself.
[01:35:30.511 --> 01:35:32.552]  Call up one of those local AMRF affiliates.
[01:35:32.592 --> 01:35:34.733]  Say WBCR outside Knoxville, Tennessee.
[01:35:34.814 --> 01:35:37.355]  Or KCXL in Kansas City, Missouri.
[01:35:37.415 --> 01:35:39.896]  Or WVTJ in Florida.
[01:35:39.916 --> 01:35:41.157]  Or just wherever you are.
[01:35:41.877 --> 01:35:46.239]  You need to call up those sponsors and tell them, I'm going to buy carpet from you.
[01:35:46.259 --> 01:35:48.100]  I'm going to get my car fixed by you.
[01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:49.001]  I'm going to go to your restaurant.
[01:35:49.021 --> 01:35:50.101]  I'm going to go to your bookstore.
[01:35:50.542 --> 01:35:53.103]  Because you are a sponsor of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:35:53.703 --> 01:35:55.104]  Or better yet, you own a business.
[01:35:55.908 --> 01:35:57.669]  We've got listeners on those local stations.
[01:35:57.749 --> 01:35:59.570]  Go spend money with that local station.
[01:36:00.190 --> 01:36:00.490]  Okay?
[01:36:00.530 --> 01:36:01.710]  Go donate with them.
[01:36:01.730 --> 01:36:13.375]  If you're listening to us up in Maryland off an affiliate, or upstate New York, those three stations, or some of the Chicago stations, or the Illinois stations, or stations all over the place.
[01:36:13.395 --> 01:36:14.416]  We're getting a lot of new stations.
[01:36:14.436 --> 01:36:18.357]  Stations in Utah, Wyoming, Corpus Christi, Texas.
[01:36:19.238 --> 01:36:20.478]  Wherever you're listening.
[01:36:20.979 --> 01:36:21.839]  There's so many now.
[01:36:23.314 --> 01:36:24.794]  Because, frankly, I don't want your money.
[01:36:24.994 --> 01:36:26.015]  I don't care about money.
[01:36:26.395 --> 01:36:27.315]  I don't need money.
[01:36:28.455 --> 01:36:29.375]  I don't like money.
[01:36:30.356 --> 01:36:31.336]  I don't like status.
[01:36:31.696 --> 01:36:33.536]  I like kicking the teeth under the New World Order.
[01:36:34.997 --> 01:36:36.097]  And, you know, I say that.
[01:36:36.177 --> 01:36:37.837]  On a certain level, I don't like or want your money.
[01:36:38.058 --> 01:36:39.598]  What I want is to fight the New World Order.
[01:36:40.558 --> 01:36:46.379]  And so we sell these citizen robux, and we get them for, what, 50 cents apiece, and we sell them for a dollar apiece.
[01:36:46.399 --> 01:36:51.961]  And by the time we ship them and pack them in packages that don't make it one out of 20 or so, we'll end up breaking even on this.
[01:36:52.281 --> 01:36:52.721]  I don't care.
[01:36:53.263 --> 01:36:55.365]  You know, I have Made in America t-shirts.
[01:36:55.385 --> 01:36:59.288]  Cost me $6.50 a piece for an extra large, you know, $5.50 for a small.
[01:36:59.728 --> 01:37:01.390]  I could get them for $2 from Mexico.
[01:37:01.510 --> 01:37:01.930]  Don't do it.
[01:37:02.671 --> 01:37:04.952]  Sell them for $9.95 right now on the website.
[01:37:05.112 --> 01:37:06.073]  Don't make money off that.
[01:37:06.474 --> 01:37:20.585]  That's why we've cut prices back to the point where I can just, I take 90 plus percent of the money that comes in here and I just hire people and buy better computers and better cameras and better software and better uploads and better material for you and try to give my people raises.
[01:37:22.316 --> 01:37:29.081]  And so if you want to support us, why don't you go to InfoWars.com and why don't you order a hundred of these citizen rule books.
[01:37:30.462 --> 01:37:31.063]  Dollar a piece.
[01:37:31.083 --> 01:37:32.404]  A hundred bucks.
[01:37:33.705 --> 01:37:36.086]  And in these citizens... And I'm going to shut up a minute and go to your calls.
[01:37:36.126 --> 01:37:37.868]  I didn't mean to get into this, but the caller brought it up.
[01:37:39.989 --> 01:37:41.150]  Handbook for jurors.
[01:37:41.190 --> 01:37:42.171]  Table of contents.
[01:37:42.391 --> 01:37:43.191]  Jury duty.
[01:37:43.252 --> 01:37:44.332]  You are above the law.
[01:37:44.512 --> 01:37:45.253]  Jury rights.
[01:37:45.333 --> 01:37:46.074]  Law of the land.
[01:37:46.114 --> 01:37:46.834]  Ten commandments.
[01:37:46.894 --> 01:37:47.775]  Communist manifesto.
[01:37:48.951 --> 01:38:06.563]  Give Up Your Rights, Jury Tampering, Section 2, Give Me Liberty, Patrick Henry Shocked, Jury Appears, Freedom for William Penn, Jefferson's Warning, Section 3, Original Documents, Index of the Documents, Declaration of Independence, The Constitution, The Bill of Rights, it goes on and on.
[01:38:07.384 --> 01:38:13.388]  And this baby is 60, really it's 62 pages long, totally jam-packed.
[01:38:13.748 --> 01:38:15.750]  You can read this in an hour, average reader.
[01:38:16.818 --> 01:38:17.558]  I want you to read it.
[01:38:17.618 --> 01:38:22.100]  I want you to read it, say, every Saturday morning when you're up at 5 a.m., 6 a.m.
[01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:24.020]  before the kids get up or whatever.
[01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:25.021]  I want you to read this.
[01:38:25.081 --> 01:38:25.981]  You say you know it.
[01:38:26.041 --> 01:38:27.121]  Well, I don't know it enough.
[01:38:27.161 --> 01:38:28.382]  I just reread this a week ago.
[01:38:29.082 --> 01:38:32.463]  You need to memorize this, and you need to then look at the world around you.
[01:38:32.523 --> 01:38:40.265]  So let me tell you how you support me by defeating the New World Order so I can live in peace, so I can have a free country to live in, so my children can be free.
[01:38:40.305 --> 01:38:41.465]  Folks, we're all in this together.
[01:38:41.746 --> 01:38:46.427]  We're all brothers and sisters, no matter what color we are, in this fight for liberty against dehumanization.
[01:38:48.553 --> 01:38:49.994]  And so that's how you support us.
[01:38:51.215 --> 01:39:03.961]  But frankly, if you've just got to write a check to somebody, I mean, if you've got to, frankly, there's been a few months before where we are losing money and enough's not coming in in the past.
[01:39:04.061 --> 01:39:07.603]  And magically, we're blessed, a large check comes in.
[01:39:07.643 --> 01:39:09.184]  And many times I've sent the checks back.
[01:39:09.664 --> 01:39:12.306]  I call up some sweet little old lady and I go, let me guess, you're
[01:39:13.439 --> 01:39:14.459]  Grandkids don't visit you.
[01:39:14.479 --> 01:39:15.720]  Your family doesn't visit you.
[01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:18.160]  And you've got a million dollars and blah, blah, blah.
[01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:19.341]  And I'm just like, you know what?
[01:39:19.821 --> 01:39:22.001]  And I bet you're giving a lot of money to the Republican Party, aren't you?
[01:39:22.041 --> 01:39:23.222]  It's the same story always.
[01:39:23.562 --> 01:39:25.362]  These poor sweet things get sucked dry.
[01:39:26.362 --> 01:39:27.843]  And I just send their money back.
[01:39:28.243 --> 01:39:29.983]  And I've called it before and people are broke.
[01:39:30.603 --> 01:39:33.524]  You know, I mean, they're old, basically eating dog food and they send me money.
[01:39:33.724 --> 01:39:34.384]  I send it back.
[01:39:34.564 --> 01:39:36.785]  I do not want money from people.
[01:39:37.927 --> 01:39:43.774]  Number one, did you know that a lot of the money I do keep for myself, I end up giving away.
[01:39:43.854 --> 01:39:48.440]  I can't control myself to widows and orphans and Meals on Wheels and family that needs it.
[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:49.722]  That's your real time.
[01:39:50.142 --> 01:39:51.864]  The Levitical priesthood is gone, folks.
[01:39:52.545 --> 01:39:52.685]  And...
[01:39:54.725 --> 01:39:58.507]  You should give to good churches, but it's not your job to give to them specifically.
[01:39:59.048 --> 01:40:01.589]  Your number one job is to give to the hungry and the needy.
[01:40:01.989 --> 01:40:03.510]  Really, I should be out.
[01:40:03.630 --> 01:40:07.393]  I want to start a ministry where we go out and have soup kitchens and feed people.
[01:40:07.833 --> 01:40:09.534]  I think the Salvation Army is good.
[01:40:10.775 --> 01:40:15.898]  You know what is the equivalent of just piles of diamonds and rubies and emeralds and gold in my hands?
[01:40:16.278 --> 01:40:21.801]  What's the equivalent of huge mansions, swimming pools, movie stars, limousines?
[01:40:22.181 --> 01:40:23.222]  None of that means anything to me.
[01:40:24.681 --> 01:40:25.641]  Giving to people.
[01:40:25.801 --> 01:40:26.302]  I love it.
[01:40:26.942 --> 01:40:27.743]  I can't stand it.
[01:40:29.404 --> 01:40:30.685]  I just can't control myself.
[01:40:31.886 --> 01:40:32.806]  That's what I'm into.
[01:40:32.866 --> 01:40:33.927]  That's what I like doing.
[01:40:36.889 --> 01:40:40.092]  So the caller raises that point about giving.
[01:40:40.552 --> 01:40:41.973]  Yes, give to our ministry.
[01:40:43.784 --> 01:40:46.406]  Call up and get a whole bunch of Marshall Law.
[01:40:47.346 --> 01:40:48.527]  I should call for distributors.
[01:40:48.607 --> 01:40:49.988]  We don't get out as many of these as we should.
[01:40:50.368 --> 01:40:56.051]  They have a huge effect because you, the listeners, get films like Marshall Law, such an important film, and you make copies of it.
[01:40:56.131 --> 01:41:06.676]  Well, if you want to support us, so when I look at the payroll, and I'm going, boy, it's a little close this month, I shouldn't have given that $5,000 to the local charity.
[01:41:11.807 --> 01:41:11.947]  And, uh...
[01:41:38.149 --> 01:41:39.932]  We need to get the word out to folks.
[01:41:40.212 --> 01:41:40.433]  Alright.
[01:41:41.054 --> 01:41:41.895]  I belabored that.
[01:41:41.995 --> 01:41:47.123]  If you want the Citizen's Rulebook, it's available via infowars.com.
[01:41:48.425 --> 01:41:50.128]  And it is the Bill of Rights Jury Handbook.
[01:41:50.188 --> 01:41:51.770]  The fireworks are in the document itself.
[01:41:51.850 --> 01:41:52.752]  Read the Constitution.
[01:41:54.531 --> 01:41:58.233]  And it's such an important little document, and it's so jam-packed.
[01:41:58.253 --> 01:41:59.733]  So go to Infowars.com to get it.
[01:42:00.193 --> 01:42:02.154]  I think they've got it up on the toll-free line by now.
[01:42:02.174 --> 01:42:03.135]  If not, they'll figure it out.
[01:42:03.175 --> 01:42:03.715]  It's 1-888-253-3139.
[01:42:04.995 --> 01:42:08.877]  Okay, see, I want to take all your calls.
[01:42:08.917 --> 01:42:10.017]  I want to cover all the news.
[01:42:10.417 --> 01:42:16.180]  But a caller like that brings up such an important point that it needs to be covered.
[01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:17.440]  It needs to be dealt with.
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:19.141]  It needs to be followed.
[01:42:20.786 --> 01:42:23.147]  And so I put it out there.
[01:42:23.167 --> 01:42:26.288]  I did see a report about the founder of Domino's Pizza.
[01:42:27.348 --> 01:42:30.749]  I rarely watch TV, but I was in a restaurant while it was on a few months ago.
[01:42:30.769 --> 01:42:32.230]  And he's a listener.
[01:42:32.250 --> 01:42:33.410]  He sent me a lot of stuff over the years.
[01:42:33.430 --> 01:42:36.491]  Some purchases, quite a few videos and stuff.
[01:42:36.531 --> 01:42:38.792]  But I never called him up and said, Hey, you're a millionaire.
[01:42:38.812 --> 01:42:40.532]  Give me some money.
[01:42:40.872 --> 01:42:42.213]  It's whatever people feel led to be...
[01:42:43.487 --> 01:42:43.787]  To do.
[01:42:43.807 --> 01:42:49.392]  I did see how he'd given almost all his fortune away to charity, to helping the needy and the homeless.
[01:42:49.612 --> 01:42:50.993]  And that's what you're supposed to do, folks.
[01:42:51.013 --> 01:42:52.615]  So frankly, I don't need his money.
[01:42:53.936 --> 01:42:57.879]  And that's the weird thing about this.
[01:43:00.821 --> 01:43:03.804]  Just dropped my jury handbook on the ground.
[01:43:05.846 --> 01:43:08.187]  Is that I have pretty high moral standards.
[01:43:08.227 --> 01:43:08.808]  I'm not perfect.
[01:43:10.838 --> 01:43:12.339]  But I'm really in this for the right reasons.
[01:43:12.359 --> 01:43:13.360]  I mean, I feel good.
[01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:18.604]  And then I get accused of the most lowly things you can imagine.
[01:43:18.624 --> 01:43:21.546]  And it's just whole cloth manufacture.
[01:43:22.347 --> 01:43:22.987]  None of it's true.
[01:43:24.008 --> 01:43:28.832]  And then I'll even on my own network, if I don't like a particular sponsor, I'm like, you know, I just can't inform myself.
[01:43:28.872 --> 01:43:30.913]  Hey, you know, I don't believe in that.
[01:43:31.474 --> 01:43:33.855]  I don't believe that something's 100% cure for this.
[01:43:33.916 --> 01:43:36.778]  I don't believe that you can get out of debt 100% pure on that.
[01:43:36.818 --> 01:43:38.299]  I don't even care what the letter of the law says.
[01:43:39.185 --> 01:43:46.947]  You know, I don't... I turn all that down, but still, I have to, at certain levels, realize that I can't control what all the other shows do.
[01:43:47.447 --> 01:43:49.328]  I can't control what other people do.
[01:43:49.368 --> 01:43:50.368]  You know, nothing's perfect.
[01:43:50.408 --> 01:43:51.989]  The world... You know, I'm in the world.
[01:43:52.009 --> 01:43:52.789]  I'm just not of it.
[01:43:53.949 --> 01:43:55.790]  And believe me, I've been a very worldly person.
[01:43:55.810 --> 01:43:57.250]  I still have to control myself not to be.
[01:43:57.550 --> 01:43:59.031]  I mean, let me tell you right now, folks.
[01:43:59.451 --> 01:44:02.311]  I'm not a... I've been around the block once or twice.
[01:44:02.852 --> 01:44:03.312]  But I know...
[01:44:04.818 --> 01:44:08.864]  Where life is, where decency is, where goodness is, and it's where the Spirit of the Lord is.
[01:44:11.432 --> 01:44:13.653]  At the same time, I can't control everyone.
[01:44:13.714 --> 01:44:15.855]  I can't make everyone do what I want them to do.
[01:44:15.875 --> 01:44:16.935]  I don't even begin to try it.
[01:44:16.955 --> 01:44:19.217]  I just have my work, one foot in front of the other.
[01:44:19.517 --> 01:44:26.701]  And that's why I've been critical of not just stuff that goes on in my own house, but other stuff, other places that gets associated with me by other networks and people.
[01:44:26.981 --> 01:44:29.143]  And then they wonder why I have trouble controlling myself.
[01:44:30.483 --> 01:44:33.925]  But again, we're trying to all be friends and get along.
[01:44:34.025 --> 01:44:34.566]  It's just that...
[01:44:40.802 --> 01:44:51.926]  You have to know, and I think that's why despite all the problems with my show and all the things I do and the obnoxiousness that I engage in, that people do tune into this broadcast more than any other alternative media broadcast out there.
[01:44:51.946 --> 01:44:55.468]  We dwarf any other similar broadcast because people deep down.
[01:44:55.488 --> 01:44:56.568]  I mean, you know the truth already.
[01:44:57.208 --> 01:44:58.489]  You know the New World Order is real.
[01:44:58.509 --> 01:44:59.770]  You know they carried out 9-11.
[01:44:59.810 --> 01:45:00.690]  You know I'm for real.
[01:45:01.702 --> 01:45:03.023]  And you know what's true.
[01:45:03.343 --> 01:45:08.067]  And just follow your guts, follow your instincts, follow the Spirit, have discernment.
[01:45:08.087 --> 01:45:10.228]  I mean, if you've got discernment, you know the truth.
[01:45:10.729 --> 01:45:14.992]  All right, now I've really gone off the deep end into a bunch of subjects, but the caller brought it up, and it's important.
[01:45:16.373 --> 01:45:18.234]  I know we've got, who's up next here?
[01:45:20.676 --> 01:45:21.116]  Cloy.
[01:45:21.776 --> 01:45:25.139]  I had that here on my screen, and I wasn't sure I was reading it correctly.
[01:45:26.305 --> 01:45:28.466]  Coy and KC, you're on the air.
[01:45:28.526 --> 01:45:28.847]  Welcome.
[01:45:28.867 --> 01:45:29.347]  Thanks for holding.
[01:45:29.587 --> 01:45:31.048]  Coy and KC, Alex.
[01:45:31.248 --> 01:45:32.328]  See, I can't ever get it right.
[01:45:32.668 --> 01:45:34.389]  Yeah, I met you up here in Kansas City.
[01:45:34.629 --> 01:45:36.090]  You're like Coy like the fish.
[01:45:36.931 --> 01:45:37.931]  No, that's K-O-Y.
[01:45:37.991 --> 01:45:39.732]  This is like the Martins and the Coys.
[01:45:39.752 --> 01:45:40.873]  Okay.
[01:45:41.133 --> 01:45:42.213]  Oh, yeah, the McCoys.
[01:45:42.273 --> 01:45:42.854]  I got you.
[01:45:42.914 --> 01:45:48.676]  Anyway, there's a show coming on TV today that caused me concern.
[01:45:49.377 --> 01:45:50.477]  I think you'll want to see it.
[01:45:50.877 --> 01:45:53.739]  But I'll tell you what caused me this concern.
[01:45:55.006 --> 01:46:02.710]  I do a lot of recording of DVDs off of WorldLink TV and Freedom of Speech and Discovery Channels and Learning Channels and History Channels.
[01:46:03.291 --> 01:46:07.493]  Well, I know all the categories, you know, like Ancient Mysteries and History Traveler, whatever.
[01:46:07.893 --> 01:46:13.096]  All of a sudden, this show comes up that I've never seen before, so I do a search on it for the next eight days.
[01:46:13.136 --> 01:46:14.456]  This was like eight days ago.
[01:46:15.979 --> 01:46:16.919]  It doesn't come up again.
[01:46:16.979 --> 01:46:19.260]  So every day I check it, and I even checked it today.
[01:46:19.321 --> 01:46:19.941]  It's not going to begin.
[01:46:19.961 --> 01:46:23.502]  It was a one-shot deal coming on the same show on twice today.
[01:46:23.602 --> 01:46:24.723]  Once at 11 this morning.
[01:46:25.083 --> 01:46:25.563]  What is it?
[01:46:25.963 --> 01:46:26.904]  I'll tell you in just a second here.
[01:46:27.124 --> 01:46:28.685]  And once at 5 this afternoon.
[01:46:29.145 --> 01:46:34.367]  And this links to this Emirate deal, and these are 21 ports.
[01:46:34.727 --> 01:46:36.308]  And I'm going to pull this up on the screen right now.
[01:46:36.328 --> 01:46:37.589]  I'm going to read you what it says.
[01:46:37.729 --> 01:46:42.771]  It says, This is History Now on History Channel 120 at 5 p.m.
[01:46:43.151 --> 01:46:45.192]  It's going to be the next time it's on.
[01:46:45.232 --> 01:46:45.452]  It says,
[01:46:46.085 --> 01:46:48.247]  Al-Qaeda's Navy Education, 2005.
[01:46:49.027 --> 01:46:54.932]  Terrorist group Al-Qaeda owns 15 to 20 large merchant freighters.
[01:46:55.793 --> 01:46:57.694]  And so I was watching this here first.
[01:46:58.015 --> 01:46:58.975]  This is an hour show.
[01:46:58.995 --> 01:47:01.077]  I was watching this while I was listening to your first hour.
[01:47:01.577 --> 01:47:06.902]  And I'll tell you, all these so-called... You know, I actually heard another talk show host talking about that a week ago.
[01:47:06.942 --> 01:47:07.722]  I forget who it was.
[01:47:07.742 --> 01:47:08.983]  It'll pop in my head in a second.
[01:47:09.003 --> 01:47:10.945]  Well, I did call it Step Miller and tell him about it.
[01:47:10.965 --> 01:47:11.505]  Oh, that's right.
[01:47:11.545 --> 01:47:12.086]  That's what I heard.
[01:47:12.166 --> 01:47:13.026]  I think I heard you.
[01:47:13.247 --> 01:47:13.667]  But the...
[01:47:15.976 --> 01:47:22.080]  I mean, you know, every freighter's registered, everything's checked, they know what's coming in, they just don't search it.
[01:47:23.421 --> 01:47:24.182]  It's staged.
[01:47:24.602 --> 01:47:28.304]  Well, yeah, this is all government propaganda right here.
[01:47:28.324 --> 01:47:31.166]  They're staging this here to something to do with these here ports.
[01:47:31.667 --> 01:47:33.908]  Like, where have they had these freighters hidden all this time?
[01:47:33.948 --> 01:47:35.969]  In those caves up in Afghanistan or somewhere?
[01:47:36.510 --> 01:47:38.071]  No, something fishy about this here.
[01:47:38.972 --> 01:47:41.053]  Well, now they have 12.
[01:47:41.113 --> 01:47:43.294]  They do have 10 different, because I've researched this.
[01:47:43.334 --> 01:47:53.077]  They have 12 different TV shows on different cable channels, PBS, Discovery, A&E, History, about how the towers were flimsily built and why they fell down from fire.
[01:47:53.557 --> 01:47:58.419]  And then in all those shows, they ignore the 47 big columns and all the facts and lie.
[01:47:58.819 --> 01:47:59.759]  I mean, you're right, sir.
[01:47:59.799 --> 01:48:02.380]  Television is just unbelievable propaganda.
[01:48:02.500 --> 01:48:06.662]  It doesn't take you too much trouble to figure out all this government propaganda on the History Channel.
[01:48:06.682 --> 01:48:08.362]  You know what they're going to do off of it.
[01:48:08.442 --> 01:48:11.183]  This is what this is right here.
[01:48:11.203 --> 01:48:14.685]  21 ports, 20 large freighters, something fishy about this whole deal.
[01:48:14.945 --> 01:48:16.765]  And the thing is, this is a one-shot deal.
[01:48:16.785 --> 01:48:20.747]  It was on one time in the last two weeks, or actually the last 18.
[01:48:20.907 --> 01:48:25.909]  Well, what it is is they've staged their propaganda beforehand and they might have been planning to pull something.
[01:48:26.841 --> 01:48:38.507]  And then it didn't happen, and they were going to claim, oh, see, the Arabs were going to get our ports, and maybe hang them out to dry so this propaganda is already phased in beforehand.
[01:48:38.787 --> 01:48:41.748]  Because, of course, it's 21 ports concerning UAE.
[01:48:42.328 --> 01:48:42.569]  Yes.
[01:48:42.949 --> 01:48:45.370]  Anyway, I just thought you might want to watch it.
[01:48:45.410 --> 01:48:47.991]  I watch all these people they have on there that are the experts.
[01:48:48.151 --> 01:48:49.572]  They all look like feds to me.
[01:48:50.737 --> 01:48:54.138]  It's like the butch haircuts and all that kind of stuff.
[01:48:54.198 --> 01:48:55.118]  Well, they'll keep us safe.
[01:48:55.138 --> 01:48:56.519]  We'll just let them run our lives.
[01:48:56.619 --> 01:48:59.640]  They're the government.
[01:48:59.660 --> 01:49:00.260]  Thanks for the call.
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:01.660]  I appreciate it.
[01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:02.361]  Interesting points.
[01:49:02.601 --> 01:49:07.462]  We'll come back and talk to Jerry in Canada, Chris in St.
[01:49:07.502 --> 01:49:09.343]  Louis, Brad in L.A., and others.
[01:49:10.443 --> 01:49:12.183]  And I will get into the new Iran developments.
[01:49:12.244 --> 01:49:18.665]  Dick Cheney is saying Iran faces meaningful consequences, and many others.
[01:49:18.986 --> 01:49:20.306]  Bolton is saying the same thing.
[01:49:21.081 --> 01:49:25.305]  And I want to get into Russia saying they're not going to go along with the deal with Iran.
[01:49:25.325 --> 01:49:26.526]  But they said that on Iraq.
[01:49:26.546 --> 01:49:27.447]  It's staged.
[01:49:28.247 --> 01:49:31.270]  And then we'll also get into this teacher being now suspended.
[01:49:31.890 --> 01:49:32.511]  Their free speech.
[01:49:32.531 --> 01:49:34.293]  What a good lesson to teach the children.
[01:49:35.113 --> 01:49:36.154]  Third hour coming up.
[01:49:36.214 --> 01:49:41.078]  But we've got a little five-minute segment on the other side of this break, so we'll take a few calls then.
[01:49:42.300 --> 01:49:43.621]  I've got to move the ear calls quicker, though.
[01:49:43.641 --> 01:49:46.123]  All the callers bring up great points, but...
[01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:48.981]  I've got to get on it and get it all covered.
[01:49:49.342 --> 01:49:53.525]  Stay with us.
[01:49:55.247 --> 01:49:58.089]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:58.350 --> 01:49:59.050]  Hello, my friends.
[01:49:59.150 --> 01:49:59.931]  Alex Jones here.
[01:50:00.271 --> 01:50:04.956]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:05.296 --> 01:50:12.022]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:12.342 --> 01:50:14.323]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:14.524 --> 01:50:17.365]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:17.465 --> 01:50:22.128]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:22.328 --> 01:50:26.751]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate medium.
[01:50:26.971 --> 01:50:34.196]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:34.456 --> 01:50:36.878]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[01:50:37.038 --> 01:50:38.759]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[01:50:54.528 --> 01:50:56.149]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:50:56.269 --> 01:51:00.391]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:51:00.511 --> 01:51:03.393]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:51:03.473 --> 01:51:10.156]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:51:10.356 --> 01:51:13.358]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:51:13.579 --> 01:51:15.960]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:26.248]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aprazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[01:51:26.448 --> 01:51:26.928]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:51:26.948 --> 01:51:27.388]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:51:27.408 --> 01:51:28.929]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:51:55.632 --> 01:52:01.561]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:52:01.802 --> 01:52:04.045]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:52:04.246 --> 01:52:10.616]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,

[01:52:26.488 --> 01:52:26.988]  We're good to go.
[01:52:27.008 --> 01:52:27.309]  I think?
[01:53:08.906 --> 01:53:11.428]  Jerry in Canada, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:53:11.488 --> 01:53:11.829]  Welcome.
[01:53:12.770 --> 01:53:14.851]  Thanks a lot for taking my call.
[01:53:15.152 --> 01:53:15.752]  Thanks for calling.
[01:53:15.792 --> 01:53:16.152]  Go ahead.
[01:53:16.653 --> 01:53:19.035]  I just wanted to phone in a quick comment and then a question.
[01:53:19.355 --> 01:53:29.324]  First of all, I just wanted to say, I saw your video of 9-11 and the rise of the police state about a couple months ago, and it's just blown my mind, opened my eyes, seeing a lot that's going on now, especially with the corporate-controlled media.
[01:53:29.744 --> 01:53:32.987]  Obviously, this is not just a local problem in the U.S.
[01:53:33.007 --> 01:53:34.048]  This is a global problem.
[01:53:34.728 --> 01:53:36.470]  I wanted to get your input on what you think
[01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:56.332]  The globalist plan is for Canada, and the difference between, you know, I see America as conditioned as almost a warrior state, as a Spartan state to go around the world, you know, and I find that Canada and Canadians are a lot more passive to these things, and when I bring up these topics to Canadians, they're like, oh, no, no, that's an American problem.
[01:53:56.672 --> 01:53:58.453]  But I see the inevitable fall of the U.S.
[01:53:58.513 --> 01:54:04.117]  as just like something that's going to definitely impact this country as well, so I wanted to know also any...
[01:54:04.938 --> 01:54:09.161]  Alternative media resources you've seen in Canada or that you find reliable in Canada?
[01:54:11.142 --> 01:54:15.845]  First off, it's harder to get my videos into Canada than it is into Communist China.
[01:54:16.686 --> 01:54:21.269]  It's easier to get them into South Korea or Japan, no problem to speak of.
[01:54:22.430 --> 01:54:25.932]  Canada is an incredible police state, no free speech to speak of.
[01:54:26.781 --> 01:54:28.803]  The public thinks they're incredibly free.
[01:54:29.703 --> 01:54:32.566]  They just have a fake liberal brand of the New World Order.
[01:54:33.046 --> 01:54:37.490]  Just like conservatives here think everything's okay because it's a, quote, conservative brand of the New World Order.
[01:54:38.250 --> 01:54:44.675]  And it's just a holding of the British Commonwealth and is going under all the exact same garbage.
[01:54:45.896 --> 01:54:49.659]  Just the population is so set against war they can't whip you into doing it.
[01:54:49.699 --> 01:54:52.381]  Plus you're, what, 20 million people so they don't care.
[01:54:52.441 --> 01:54:53.222]  It's 20 million, right?
[01:54:54.296 --> 01:54:54.556]  30 million.
[01:54:54.596 --> 01:54:55.958]  There's just over 30 million, they say.
[01:54:56.478 --> 01:54:58.740]  Okay, well, I guess I'm going off 10, 15-year-old numbers.
[01:54:58.820 --> 01:55:00.361]  I see somewhere this is 22 million.
[01:55:00.701 --> 01:55:01.742]  So you're 30 million now.
[01:55:01.762 --> 01:55:03.984]  You must have been a lot of immigration, I guess.
[01:55:04.144 --> 01:55:06.586]  Huge immigration population in Canada.
[01:55:06.626 --> 01:55:13.312]  They say the immigration population in Toronto is over the 50% mark, and the second language in Canada is no longer English.
[01:55:13.332 --> 01:55:14.973]  It's actually... Or it's no longer French.
[01:55:14.993 --> 01:55:15.834]  It's actually Chinese.
[01:55:15.954 --> 01:55:16.674]  Yeah, I knew that.
[01:55:16.734 --> 01:55:18.195]  I knew that, like, some cities were half.
[01:55:18.756 --> 01:55:22.059]  Wow, because, I mean, I remember... See, I'll give out numbers, and they're old.
[01:55:22.119 --> 01:55:22.439]  I remember...
[01:55:23.482 --> 01:55:26.684]  I see in a census, it was probably five, six years ago, and it said 22 million.
[01:55:26.764 --> 01:55:27.625]  Wow!
[01:55:27.645 --> 01:55:28.065]  30 million?
[01:55:28.405 --> 01:55:29.186]  Over 30 million.
[01:55:29.206 --> 01:55:29.926]  Over 30 million.
[01:55:29.946 --> 01:55:30.467]  Definitely over 30.
[01:55:30.807 --> 01:55:31.407]  So they tell us.
[01:55:31.427 --> 01:55:37.151]  You know, I haven't done a census myself, but that's the numbers that have definitely been told to me.
[01:55:37.631 --> 01:55:37.891]  Wow.
[01:55:37.911 --> 01:55:38.732]  Well, that's big.
[01:55:38.952 --> 01:55:39.793]  Bigger than California.
[01:55:40.473 --> 01:55:40.673]  Okay.
[01:55:40.713 --> 01:55:42.975]  I guess California is, what, 26, 27 million.
[01:55:43.595 --> 01:55:44.255]  All right, sir.
[01:55:44.295 --> 01:55:45.716]  Well, I really don't know what I can say.
[01:55:45.756 --> 01:55:52.801]  I mean, I know that it's a big-time police state, and they arrest people for what they're saying in their free speech, and
[01:55:53.613 --> 01:55:54.634]  A lot of big problems.
[01:55:54.674 --> 01:55:57.095]  Canadians, I've found, are just great people.
[01:55:57.135 --> 01:56:02.038]  Really nice, sweet folks, but really in la-la land.
[01:56:02.058 --> 01:56:07.361]  You know, awake to the imperialism of the U.S., but don't realize they're just another brand of the same thing.
[01:56:07.642 --> 01:56:08.662]  Yeah, totally passive.
[01:56:08.782 --> 01:56:14.326]  I mean, you tell people, even though you're talking about health industry and how the hidden alternative medicines.
[01:56:14.386 --> 01:56:16.087]  Look at natural hygiene.
[01:56:16.347 --> 01:56:17.948]  150 years ago, they were curing all these diseases.
[01:56:18.468 --> 01:56:23.071]  Look at some of these doctors, like Herbert Shelton, or even more moderate, Harvey Diamond.
[01:56:23.427 --> 01:56:27.088]  He's got five books out, and every one of them will tell you how to cure any of these diseases.
[01:56:28.008 --> 01:56:31.149]  And they're not even allowed to tell you that that's a cure for those diseases.
[01:56:31.229 --> 01:56:49.093]  But if you look at the evidence, if you look at the medical, if you look at any kind of test they've done, Patty's tests on cats through generations with raw versus processed food or just cooking the food alone, how that can impact our genetics and how that makes us completely, you know, it's making us lazy.
[01:56:49.533 --> 01:56:52.434]  Just those foods, an alternative, and then they give us diseases.
[01:56:53.015 --> 01:56:55.056]  And then, of course, they feed us their solutions, right?
[01:56:56.137 --> 01:56:57.398]  Boy, you said it, brother.
[01:56:57.458 --> 01:56:58.799]  I appreciate your call.
[01:57:00.199 --> 01:57:02.581]  I mean, they know what aspartame does.
[01:57:02.681 --> 01:57:04.282]  They know what MSG does.
[01:57:04.322 --> 01:57:05.983]  They know what stannous fluoride does.
[01:57:06.003 --> 01:57:07.924]  They know exactly what it did before they put it in.
[01:57:09.185 --> 01:57:20.312]  I mean, I remember not believing 10 years ago hearing the concentration camp guards in Nazi Germany use sodium fluoride and stannous fluoride as a sedative on the camp victims, the workers.
[01:57:20.979 --> 01:57:23.761]  And then I've now read that in mainstream history books.
[01:57:24.661 --> 01:57:25.562]  Written right after the war.
[01:57:25.622 --> 01:57:26.783]  I mean, German history books.
[01:57:27.964 --> 01:57:29.364]  Ah, heaven help us.
[01:57:29.905 --> 01:57:30.665]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:33.707 --> 01:57:38.590]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:50.340 --> 01:57:50.981]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.661 --> 01:57:52.702]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.423 --> 01:57:54.524]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.184 --> 01:57:56.005]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.745 --> 01:57:58.667]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.687 --> 01:58:02.010]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.510 --> 01:58:06.593]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:15.569 --> 01:58:18.270]  The globalist controllers are a bunch of bullies.
[01:58:18.291 --> 01:58:25.754]  They're trying to intimidate us, letting us know they're spying on everyone, trying to get us to shut up and knuckle under to their criminal activity.
[01:58:26.275 --> 01:58:28.636]  It's time to send these creatures packing.
[01:58:28.676 --> 01:58:32.258]  It's time to let them know that we know that they're the crooks and they're going to be exposed.
[01:58:33.468 --> 01:58:37.010]  Let's go to Chris and then Brad and then Chris, and then I'm going to get back into the news.
[01:58:37.050 --> 01:58:37.731]  There's a lot of it.
[01:58:38.091 --> 01:58:40.292]  Poll, Cheney less popular than OJ.
[01:58:40.312 --> 01:58:43.535]  Another poll, 72% of troops want out of Iraq.
[01:58:43.855 --> 01:58:44.675]  We'll cover it all.
[01:58:45.356 --> 01:58:46.556]  More on the Iran situation.
[01:58:46.576 --> 01:58:47.897]  I will cover these articles.
[01:58:47.917 --> 01:58:49.318]  It's very important we get to them.
[01:58:49.718 --> 01:58:50.619]  Chris in St.
[01:58:50.639 --> 01:58:51.379]  Louis, Missouri.
[01:58:51.399 --> 01:58:51.780]  Go ahead.
[01:58:52.180 --> 01:58:53.020]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:58:53.241 --> 01:58:53.521]  Good.
[01:58:53.901 --> 01:58:55.422]  Well, I just have a question.
[01:58:55.462 --> 01:59:01.426]  If you've heard much about the Missouri sex offender legislation that's out right now, someone just wrote...
[01:59:02.929 --> 01:59:10.732]  Representative Schaaf in Missouri actually is trying to pass legislation that allows for warrantless searches of people on this sex offender database.
[01:59:11.592 --> 01:59:15.033]  I know they've done similar things around the country.
[01:59:17.234 --> 01:59:18.794]  Number one, these people shouldn't be out of jail.
[01:59:20.495 --> 01:59:25.096]  Number two, they've widened it so incredibly that some of the people are innocent.
[01:59:26.163 --> 01:59:36.932]  Number three, they always do this stuff with an unsavory, degenerate group that nobody likes, and they expand it out from there.
[01:59:38.794 --> 01:59:40.675]  Yes, I have read about it, and I'm against it.
[01:59:41.236 --> 01:59:47.121]  Actually, the reason I was calling was because I was at a bar with a friend of mine this weekend.
[01:59:47.141 --> 01:59:52.045]  We were just having a couple drinks, and he works for a software company that just got a state contract to...
[01:59:53.021 --> 01:59:55.642]  Help work on this sex offender database?
[01:59:55.982 --> 02:00:04.666]  And he was telling me, I mean, this is just from, you know, I don't have any documentation, it's just from him, but he was saying that the, like you were saying, a lot of these people are innocent and that these
[02:00:05.632 --> 02:00:10.556]  Controls on these databases are really weak and that people can get put on these sex offender databases.
[02:00:10.576 --> 02:00:24.409]  Sir, you can, I mean, I've probably seen conservatively, and that's not even the main news we cover here, but I've probably seen a hundred articles in the last two years where, admittedly, it's a 17-year-old captain of the football team
[02:00:25.149 --> 02:00:28.893]  His girlfriend is a 16-year-old junior.
[02:00:28.973 --> 02:00:29.773]  He's a senior.
[02:00:30.094 --> 02:00:34.258]  He gets her pregnant, and then he's on a sex offender database for the rest of his life.
[02:00:34.398 --> 02:00:37.420]  Yeah, I saw that story, too.
[02:00:37.501 --> 02:00:39.462]  I've seen that story duplicated time and time again.
[02:00:40.663 --> 02:00:48.751]  I mean, number one, it needs to be tightened down to real scumbags, and then real scumbags need to never get out of prison.
[02:00:49.338 --> 02:00:50.458]  Mm-hmm.
[02:00:50.598 --> 02:01:05.741]  Real perverts, real child kidnappers, real... In fact, I always read about schoolteachers who do this stuff to kids, and then they get a further unification, their own probation, and they get moved secretly to another state.
[02:01:05.781 --> 02:01:09.621]  Did you know in Texas, schoolteachers don't have to be in that database?
[02:01:10.082 --> 02:01:10.782]  I did not know that.
[02:01:10.822 --> 02:01:12.102]  Yeah, oh, it's sick, man.
[02:01:12.202 --> 02:01:13.942]  It's so sick.
[02:01:14.582 --> 02:01:15.963]  It's so incredible.
[02:01:16.243 --> 02:01:17.443]  Yeah, and the thing is, it's like...
[02:01:18.934 --> 02:01:20.574]  It just seems like it's a control tool.
[02:01:20.594 --> 02:01:24.335]  These people, they want to get as much information about you as they can.
[02:01:24.355 --> 02:01:29.197]  They build the databases on the scum, and there's a bunch of cases of this.
[02:01:30.217 --> 02:01:35.438]  They start the programs with a scum group, and then, oh, we'll move it to alcoholic drunk drivers.
[02:01:35.458 --> 02:01:37.579]  Then we'll move it to people who didn't pay their debt.
[02:01:37.619 --> 02:01:40.080]  See, it's for everybody, sir.
[02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:41.220]  Yeah, and it seems like...
[02:01:43.164 --> 02:01:52.871]  Sir, with the new national ID card with the national sales tax being pushed as the fair tax by Bortz and others, and this is official, everything you do will be tracked, brother.
[02:01:53.231 --> 02:01:56.333]  So do you think this is just kind of starting to put that system in place?
[02:01:56.573 --> 02:01:57.514]  It's already in place.
[02:01:57.554 --> 02:01:59.355]  He's just legitimizing it slowly.
[02:01:59.395 --> 02:02:03.898]  Because he was saying that people can get put on these databases for crimes that aren't listed, like...
[02:02:05.498 --> 02:02:05.738]  Yes.
[02:02:06.079 --> 02:02:07.440]  Simple sexual harassment at work.
[02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:07.960]  Yes.
[02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:08.941]  You know, things like that.
[02:02:08.961 --> 02:02:09.221]  No, no, no.
[02:02:09.241 --> 02:02:12.604]  See, they change it from sex offender to sex crime.
[02:02:12.964 --> 02:02:18.949]  And yes, sir, a civil conviction in some states, it's big in England, for sexual harassment gets you on the database.
[02:02:19.250 --> 02:02:20.991]  I just want to let you know that I think you're doing a great job.
[02:02:21.031 --> 02:02:21.852]  I bought your videos.
[02:02:21.892 --> 02:02:22.733]  I think they're wonderful.
[02:02:22.833 --> 02:02:25.975]  And I'm trying to let everybody I know, you know, get informed.
[02:02:26.596 --> 02:02:27.156]  Thank you, sir.
[02:02:28.558 --> 02:02:30.539]  I really do appreciate your call and your support.
[02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:33.702]  It's that purchase of the videos that makes this broadcast possible.
[02:02:34.505 --> 02:02:36.528]  Remember to support the affiliates as well.
[02:02:36.588 --> 02:02:38.470]  I'm so proud of all these wonderful affiliates.
[02:02:38.510 --> 02:02:39.011]  God bless them.
[02:02:39.271 --> 02:02:41.233]  All right, we'll be right back to take some more calls.
[02:02:41.334 --> 02:02:42.675]  Next up is Brad from L.A.
[02:02:43.196 --> 02:02:43.857]  Stay with us.
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:49.584]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:02:50.305 --> 02:02:51.605]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:02:51.805 --> 02:02:57.547]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:02:57.827 --> 02:03:03.068]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:03:03.368 --> 02:03:07.529]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:03:07.689 --> 02:03:11.470]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[02:03:11.730 --> 02:03:16.371]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:03:16.451 --> 02:03:19.192]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[02:03:19.532 --> 02:03:22.693]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[02:03:22.753 --> 02:03:24.614]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:05:57.355 --> 02:06:02.239]  Monday through Friday, 11 to 2, Central Standard Time, Genesis Communications, Radio Network.
[02:06:02.299 --> 02:06:05.761]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, back from 9 to midnight, Central Standard Time.
[02:06:06.082 --> 02:06:10.605]  We're not just on your AM or FM dial, we're also on Global Shortwave, WWCR.com.
[02:06:11.374 --> 02:06:16.036]  Day and night and on the internet at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:06:16.456 --> 02:06:19.277]  And again, I'm really proud of the job that all of my team are doing.
[02:06:19.297 --> 02:06:24.939]  We have a new crew member here, Aaron, here in the Austin offices.
[02:06:24.959 --> 02:06:28.000]  We have offices, folks over in London and in Sheffield, England.
[02:06:28.680 --> 02:06:32.541]  But as well down in Louisiana, folks that are on the team.
[02:06:32.601 --> 02:06:34.322]  But Aaron is taking over.
[02:06:35.157 --> 02:06:37.019]  JonesReport.com.
[02:06:37.079 --> 02:06:38.580]  JonesReport.com.
[02:06:39.741 --> 02:06:40.842]  One of his many duties.
[02:06:41.482 --> 02:06:46.866]  And he's updated the links, and we're going to make it kind of a subject-oriented website.
[02:06:47.307 --> 02:06:51.890]  Vaccines, aspartame, government-sponsored terror, 9-11.
[02:06:53.171 --> 02:07:02.559]  Just a smattering of top issues that are really important for people to know with the top headlines every day up at the top of the page.
[02:07:03.803 --> 02:07:09.127]  Hence their top headlines, but it's kind of double entendre there.
[02:07:10.287 --> 02:07:16.411]  So, JonesReport.com, a site that I've just kind of had sitting out there forever, never really promoting.
[02:07:16.911 --> 02:07:19.613]  JonesReport.com, get ready for it.
[02:07:19.693 --> 02:07:22.275]  It'll have some of its own exclusives every week.
[02:07:23.030 --> 02:07:25.972]  And a lot more, and we're proud of the work he's doing.
[02:07:25.993 --> 02:07:39.243]  He'll also be working on PrisonPlanet.tv, uploading more videos, more films, more material, more mini-docs, more local TV show reports, more in-studio interviews through PrisonPlanet.tv, so it's good to have him on board with us.
[02:07:39.503 --> 02:07:42.305]  I'm going to take two more calls, and I'm going to get back in the news, and we'll go back into calls.
[02:07:42.726 --> 02:07:44.967]  Brad in L.A., you're on the air.
[02:07:45.328 --> 02:07:46.849]  Hey, Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[02:07:46.909 --> 02:07:47.549]  I appreciate it.
[02:07:47.750 --> 02:07:48.030]  You bet.
[02:07:48.050 --> 02:07:48.370]  Thank you.
[02:07:49.651 --> 02:07:52.113]  One question and one opinion from you, please.
[02:07:52.641 --> 02:07:59.330]  I just finished a book called The Sanctus Germanus Prophecies, the event leading up to the year 2012 by a guy named Michael Mao.
[02:08:00.071 --> 02:08:00.632]  You read the book?
[02:08:01.493 --> 02:08:02.394]  No, I haven't read it.
[02:08:03.256 --> 02:08:07.601]  Do you know anything about the whole idea of Sanctus Germanus?
[02:08:09.184 --> 02:08:09.985]  Or Saint Germain?
[02:08:11.435 --> 02:08:12.376]  Have you ever heard about this?
[02:08:13.396 --> 02:08:14.897]  I don't know about Saint Germain.
[02:08:15.218 --> 02:08:22.722]  I don't really get into the more archaic or Byzantine or, let's just say, nebulous issues in the world.
[02:08:22.742 --> 02:08:22.822]  Okay.
[02:08:24.623 --> 02:08:30.847]  I have been to Chichen Itza, and I have been to, I don't know, four or five other, more than that, actually, ruins.
[02:08:31.227 --> 02:08:36.711]  I've actually read quite a few books on Mesoamerica, and I even took some university classes on it.
[02:08:37.031 --> 02:08:39.973]  So I know all about 2012 and the Mayan calendar.
[02:08:39.993 --> 02:08:40.073]  Yeah.
[02:08:40.813 --> 02:08:47.057]  I do not know how that integrates in with some type of Catholic dogma.
[02:08:47.817 --> 02:08:50.259]  I will, you know, for whatever it's worth, I'll just give you this.
[02:08:50.779 --> 02:08:58.964]  They seem to be, this group, or whatever the hell you want to call it, seem to be kind of the antithesis to the New World Order group.
[02:08:59.004 --> 02:09:07.249]  It's the same idea that all these principles have been passed up for, you know, centuries and centuries, and these guys, the quote-unquote gods,
[02:09:08.072 --> 02:09:08.312]  St.
[02:09:08.432 --> 02:09:16.700]  Germain Group is actually working in the same way as the MWO folks, but just on the opposite end of the spectrum.
[02:09:17.340 --> 02:09:30.992]  And it's interesting because, you know, it kind of gives you a little hope that, you know, yes, the MWO people are working as hard as they possibly can, but, you know, on the other end of that spectrum, there are these people, and they're working in the same way just on the other end.
[02:09:31.453 --> 02:09:34.395]  So for whatever it's worth, I Googled and got some information on it.
[02:09:34.455 --> 02:09:35.236]  It was interesting.
[02:09:36.058 --> 02:09:50.174]  So, my question for you is, given the fact that it's becoming more and more visible to people who didn't get it before, that our government is doing all this on purpose.
[02:09:50.234 --> 02:09:51.415]  I mean, Dubai, Iraq...
[02:09:52.731 --> 02:09:58.954]  India, just this past week, and now... Yeah, they're going to let them really have a nuclear arms race with Pakistan now.
[02:09:59.234 --> 02:09:59.995]  It is, it is.
[02:10:00.095 --> 02:10:03.276]  With our government selling both sides, you know.
[02:10:03.296 --> 02:10:05.997]  But Iran's done nothing, they've got to be attacked.
[02:10:06.238 --> 02:10:06.698]  Yeah, I know.
[02:10:06.718 --> 02:10:13.101]  But don't tell the general public that, because that will not... the minority that wants war, because they don't want to be confused with the facts.
[02:10:13.421 --> 02:10:16.582]  Well, and they also, you know, the government has to prep us, too.
[02:10:16.663 --> 02:10:19.684]  So it's interesting, on the McLaughlin Group this past Sunday...
[02:10:20.366 --> 02:10:22.187]  Pat Buchanan actually called it.
[02:10:22.227 --> 02:10:28.949]  Of all the wacky people to call it, Pat Buchanan actually came out and said, I predict an invasion of Iraq by October.
[02:10:29.069 --> 02:10:31.130]  And the rest of the group went very, very sideless.
[02:10:31.170 --> 02:10:31.870]  You mean Iran.
[02:10:31.890 --> 02:10:33.730]  Excuse me, yes, thank you, Iran.
[02:10:33.750 --> 02:10:44.814]  So the question is... The question is, you know, now that things are so out in the open and that people who didn't get it before are starting to get it, how do you talk to them about...
[02:10:46.041 --> 02:10:51.124]  You know, how do you talk to the blind about getting vision without scaring the hell out of them?
[02:10:52.445 --> 02:11:02.350]  I think a lot of people are on the fence, and it's got to be handled rather, not delicately, but you can't just throw a bunch of this, you know, facts at them and we'll scare the hell out of them.
[02:11:02.751 --> 02:11:04.452]  Well, they need to be scared, brother.
[02:11:05.052 --> 02:11:06.053]  Believe me, I know.
[02:11:06.133 --> 02:11:09.054]  But, you know, it's one of those things where it's like an ostrich.
[02:11:09.074 --> 02:11:11.996]  If you scare it too bad, it's just going to jam its head back underneath the sand.
[02:11:12.016 --> 02:11:15.118]  You know, the ostrich really does that to hear vibrations.
[02:11:16.945 --> 02:11:21.027]  I should have known to try that one with you.
[02:11:21.067 --> 02:11:21.768]  I'm sure you knew that.
[02:11:22.008 --> 02:11:22.848]  Listen, thanks for the call.
[02:11:23.149 --> 02:11:28.452]  No, but I still use the analogy, too, of sticking the heads in the stand instead of being the eagles in the air.
[02:11:29.753 --> 02:11:37.478]  So, look, going back to your 2012 business, we hear that it's going to be the end of the world.
[02:11:37.998 --> 02:11:42.001]  I wouldn't believe anything the Mayans or any of those other cultures had to say.
[02:11:42.021 --> 02:11:43.162]  I mean, give me a break.
[02:11:44.025 --> 02:11:48.206]  And I don't want to get emails going, how dare you bash a culture, you're a xenophobe.
[02:11:48.686 --> 02:11:49.947]  I don't like the Nazi culture.
[02:11:50.247 --> 02:11:52.088]  I don't like the Soviet Russian culture.
[02:11:52.768 --> 02:11:54.488]  I don't like the Communist Chinese culture.
[02:11:55.589 --> 02:12:01.250]  The Nazis had a culture of death and black uniforms and killing people and war and scams and corruption.
[02:12:01.651 --> 02:12:03.091]  That's a corrupt, degenerate culture.
[02:12:03.151 --> 02:12:04.852]  And the Mayans, give me a break.
[02:12:05.712 --> 02:12:09.413]  They had a corrupt priest class that dominated and enslaved their population.
[02:12:10.285 --> 02:12:15.849]  And engage in ritualized warfare and would kill tens of thousands of their own people on a routine basis.
[02:12:16.670 --> 02:12:21.854]  And they were totally hopped up on hallucinogenic drugs and they were totally satanic, for lack of a better term.
[02:12:21.914 --> 02:12:23.435]  I mean, that's what they were.
[02:12:24.516 --> 02:12:35.964]  And they believed that thousands had to be sacrificed and there had to be this big bloodletting or that gods would wake up from their dream and then the dream would end and our reality would end.
[02:12:36.969 --> 02:12:46.955]  And I talked to a Mayan scholar, actually, when I was down in Mexico a few months ago, for a few days, and way down on the Guatemala border, and he was talking about it.
[02:12:46.975 --> 02:12:51.338]  He said, well, and we don't really believe it totally, it's just that they wake up, the whole existing order dies.
[02:12:51.358 --> 02:12:55.720]  I mean, give me a break, folks.
[02:12:55.980 --> 02:12:57.901]  Please give me a break.
[02:12:58.722 --> 02:13:03.685]  I just, we have all these real things to deal with, and to put all of our stock...
[02:13:06.576 --> 02:13:08.698]  In a bunch of devil-worshipping heathens.
[02:13:10.100 --> 02:13:14.185]  Well, if you didn't believe in a devil, Alex, they ate their children, okay?
[02:13:14.205 --> 02:13:15.287]  That's the devil, okay?
[02:13:15.607 --> 02:13:17.309]  I don't care if they think that's cute and funny.
[02:13:17.630 --> 02:13:19.152]  The Nazis aren't cute and funny either.
[02:13:20.505 --> 02:13:23.166]  And so that's where I stand on that.
[02:13:23.366 --> 02:13:25.146]  And I hear this thing about Nassera.
[02:13:25.206 --> 02:13:25.946]  I get these emails.
[02:13:26.587 --> 02:13:27.607]  Oh, Alex is bad.
[02:13:27.667 --> 02:13:29.527]  He won't talk about Nassera.
[02:13:30.008 --> 02:13:35.829]  There's secretly a group in the government who know there's martial law and are defeating it underground.
[02:13:35.909 --> 02:13:36.889]  Everything's okay.
[02:13:37.349 --> 02:13:39.510]  That's the we're going to be raptured next week crowd.
[02:13:39.550 --> 02:13:40.430]  Don't worry about it.
[02:13:41.210 --> 02:13:44.871]  And, you know, we hear, oh, there's really a good group in the Illuminati fighting for enlightenment.
[02:13:45.532 --> 02:13:47.072]  The Illuminati recruits...
[02:13:48.485 --> 02:13:58.749]  Inside elite circles by claiming, oh, we have to be secretive, we have to be quiet, we have to have secret power because we're really guarding this hidden knowledge and we're fighting another dark group.
[02:13:59.230 --> 02:14:08.533]  And then they test you and see if you're really evil and over time test you and see if they can turn you to what they're trying to do by claiming they're part of some elite enlightened group.
[02:14:09.114 --> 02:14:10.214]  Very, very dangerous.
[02:14:10.254 --> 02:14:12.195]  The whole New Age thing, very, very dangerous.
[02:14:13.883 --> 02:14:21.729]  And look, people are off on, and you know, it's all about being inside their own minds, and they're saving the world by themselves, and they don't want to hear it from you.
[02:14:21.889 --> 02:14:26.933]  Oh, they're on the path, and they just don't get it, and they're on a power trip.
[02:14:27.894 --> 02:14:29.755]  And you really can't help them.
[02:14:31.457 --> 02:14:32.658]  Are there good people in government?
[02:14:32.718 --> 02:14:33.078]  Certainly.
[02:14:33.118 --> 02:14:34.419]  Are there good groups in government?
[02:14:34.459 --> 02:14:34.839]  Yes.
[02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:39.103]  But they're not multi-thousand-year-old secret guilds that guard it.
[02:14:39.543 --> 02:14:43.486]  Some of the low-level functionaries may think they're a part of that secret guild, but that's all Illuminati.
[02:14:44.201 --> 02:14:46.645]  That's how they recruited George Washington and others.
[02:14:47.165 --> 02:14:51.191]  So they tried to recruit him and others as they saw them rising in power against the crown.
[02:14:51.591 --> 02:15:01.265]  Then later Washington and Jefferson found out about the scam, spoke out against it, wrote books, wrote letters, said masonry had been taken over, said they were trying to co-opt them.
[02:15:02.085 --> 02:15:05.648]  You see, there was a revolutionary fervor rising in the 1760s, 1770s.
[02:15:05.808 --> 02:15:08.910]  The Illuminati already existed.
[02:15:08.950 --> 02:15:12.552]  It wasn't founded in 1775, 1776 by Weishaupt and the Rothschilds.
[02:15:12.893 --> 02:15:23.580]  They were just trying to control all sides, just like they controlled Napoleon and they controlled the British in that war, and were manipulating the outcome, selling weapons and loans to both sides.
[02:15:24.501 --> 02:15:27.623]  Well, it's the same thing with trying to infiltrate revolutionary movements.
[02:15:27.643 --> 02:15:29.044]  You don't think that hasn't happened to us here?
[02:15:31.078 --> 02:15:36.622]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Arkansas, and then we'll come back and cover news.
[02:15:36.682 --> 02:15:37.482]  Chris, you're on the air.
[02:15:37.522 --> 02:15:37.943]  Go ahead.
[02:15:38.683 --> 02:15:45.848]  Hey, Alex, I've got a movie in front of me, and it's called Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Next Generation.
[02:15:46.649 --> 02:15:55.014]  It was put out by Columbia TriStar Entertainment, and it's got Renee Zellweger in it and Matthew McConaughey.
[02:15:55.195 --> 02:15:55.475]  Yes.
[02:15:55.895 --> 02:15:58.617]  The reason I say all this... I haven't seen it, but I saw ads for it, like,
[02:15:59.053 --> 02:16:00.374]  Six, seven years ago when it came out?
[02:16:00.834 --> 02:16:03.776]  I think it was in 1994 is when it came out.
[02:16:03.876 --> 02:16:04.537]  I might be wrong.
[02:16:04.677 --> 02:16:06.178]  Boy, time has really flown by.
[02:16:06.238 --> 02:16:07.358]  Okay.
[02:16:07.418 --> 02:16:09.079]  You're probably wondering why I'm saying all this.
[02:16:09.560 --> 02:16:12.161]  The reason is it's just bizarre.
[02:16:12.802 --> 02:16:15.323]  It's almost laughable how bad the acting is.
[02:16:15.984 --> 02:16:17.505]  It's not even really scary.
[02:16:17.985 --> 02:16:27.391]  But it's extremely bizarre because they make several references to the Illuminati in it, and they plug it in for like two or three minutes at a time, and they talk about it.
[02:16:30.125 --> 02:16:38.787]  Yeah, that's because those individuals, from what I know, are aware of the New World Order.
[02:16:38.807 --> 02:16:39.807]  They're trying to slip it in.
[02:16:39.827 --> 02:16:41.748]  I don't think they're trying to do it from a nasty point of view.
[02:16:43.528 --> 02:16:44.729]  And that's not true.
[02:16:44.789 --> 02:16:49.650]  I was watching HBO once, and I watched about ten minutes of it, and I was laughing at it.
[02:16:49.690 --> 02:16:50.750]  It was really stupid.
[02:16:51.471 --> 02:16:53.011]  Nothing against Matthew McConaughey.
[02:16:53.675 --> 02:16:58.678]  Yeah, well, I mean, he was the best part of watching the whole movie, but it's just laughable how bad the acting is.
[02:16:58.818 --> 02:17:00.458]  He's got that little neck brace on.
[02:17:00.479 --> 02:17:04.060]  He was like going, like snorting at the dinner table.
[02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:04.921]  That's the part I saw.
[02:17:05.141 --> 02:17:08.483]  Yeah, he had some kind of leg device that was mechanical.
[02:17:08.523 --> 02:17:13.765]  I don't know if they were trying to throw that in with the mechanization and the dehumanization of humans.
[02:17:13.825 --> 02:17:16.186]  I don't know what kind of point they were trying to make with it.
[02:17:16.226 --> 02:17:18.207]  Well, you know, that's all based on a true story.
[02:17:19.388 --> 02:17:21.049]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[02:17:21.599 --> 02:17:25.401]  Extremely bizarre, though, how they threw the Illuminati in there into the plot line.
[02:17:25.421 --> 02:17:27.401]  Just wanted to tell people about that.
[02:17:27.502 --> 02:17:32.384]  Go rent it and watch it, because it's extremely bizarre how they put the Illuminati in there.
[02:17:32.404 --> 02:17:34.765]  That's really all I wanted to say.
[02:17:34.785 --> 02:17:36.005]  All right, my friend.
[02:17:36.045 --> 02:17:37.346]  I appreciate the call, Chris.
[02:17:38.006 --> 02:17:41.567]  Watch out in them backwoods for Leatherface.

[02:20:45.408 --> 02:20:49.451]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:20:49.671 --> 02:20:53.053]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:20:53.253 --> 02:20:56.675]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:20:56.969 --> 02:21:00.230]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:21:00.250 --> 02:21:05.712]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:21:05.752 --> 02:21:15.375]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:21:15.495 --> 02:21:16.855]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[02:21:16.875 --> 02:21:22.277]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:21:22.797 --> 02:21:27.258]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:21:27.298 --> 02:21:28.659]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:21:28.839 --> 02:21:33.220]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[02:21:33.380 --> 02:21:34.860]  That toll-free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[02:21:34.880 --> 02:21:39.882]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:21:52.637 --> 02:21:54.998]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:22:00.139 --> 02:22:01.419]  New national poll out.
[02:22:03.159 --> 02:22:05.940]  Cheney less popular than OJ Simpson.
[02:22:06.120 --> 02:22:06.560]  How low is 18%?
[02:22:06.720 --> 02:22:10.721]  This was a headline in the Washington Post on March 5th.
[02:22:11.201 --> 02:22:21.683]  The 18% is the support rate Vice President Dick Cheney has from a public opinion survey conducted by CBS with an error of plus or minus three points.
[02:22:22.671 --> 02:22:26.112]  So it could be as low as 15 or as high as 21.
[02:22:26.872 --> 02:22:32.294]  The Washington Post included the support rates of notoriously famous people to prove how low 18 is.
[02:22:32.835 --> 02:22:39.697]  Michael Jackson, who was allegedly of sexual harassing an underage boy, and American football player O.J.
[02:22:39.777 --> 02:22:47.560]  Simpson, who caused a huge clamor for being suspected of murdering his wife at 94, each maintained 25% and 29% favorable impression rates, respectively.
[02:22:52.855 --> 02:22:58.518]  Richard Nixon maintains a 45% support rate.
[02:22:59.358 --> 02:23:00.058]  It goes on.
[02:23:00.098 --> 02:23:12.503]  The only less popular vice president is Paris Hilton, the female actress Hilton, who is an heiress of the global hotel chain Hilton Group and who has a blonde party girl image, only got 15% approval rating.
[02:23:15.916 --> 02:23:17.117]  The paper wrote, And again...
[02:23:30.393 --> 02:23:31.334]  He's just a puppet.
[02:23:31.394 --> 02:23:38.397]  They can have Cheney and Bush carry out the globalist operations, and after four or eight years, they remove them, put in new puppets.
[02:23:38.417 --> 02:23:39.658]  The Democrats all defend them.
[02:23:39.678 --> 02:23:41.779]  It takes five years to wake the Democrats up.
[02:23:42.219 --> 02:23:45.361]  Republicans see every bit of corruption the entire time.
[02:23:45.421 --> 02:23:48.963]  It's like Democrats see all of Bush's corruption but can't see their own party.
[02:23:49.003 --> 02:23:50.723]  It's like, oh, I love Bill Clinton.
[02:23:50.743 --> 02:23:51.204]  He's so good.
[02:23:51.224 --> 02:23:52.244]  Oh, but he's part of the Port Steel.
[02:23:52.264 --> 02:23:52.945]  Well, that's okay.
[02:23:52.985 --> 02:23:54.165]  Oh, but I hate Bush for it.
[02:23:54.966 --> 02:23:56.827]  It's just mindless partisanship.
[02:23:56.867 --> 02:23:59.328]  They all are owned by the same individuals.
[02:24:00.746 --> 02:24:01.587]  Here's another poll.
[02:24:01.687 --> 02:24:03.128]  Troops to Bush.
[02:24:03.288 --> 02:24:04.329]  Get us out of here.
[02:24:04.349 --> 02:24:07.191]  And Dave Lindorf is writing about this big poll.
[02:24:08.172 --> 02:24:09.533]  Well, now we have it.
[02:24:09.673 --> 02:24:20.062]  If you're one of those people with a yellow support the troops magnet on your car, you might consider doing what 72% of those troops in Iraq want, which is to go home.
[02:24:20.702 --> 02:24:28.549]  You might not know it if you get your news from TV or your local paper or even if you read the New York Times, but skip the opinion page.
[02:24:29.950 --> 02:24:40.957]  Zogby International, a leading polling organization, one of the best, just did a major poll of 944 American soldiers and Marines in Iraq and found that nearly three-quarters of them thought the U.S.
[02:24:40.977 --> 02:24:42.458]  should exit Iraq within a year.
[02:24:42.899 --> 02:24:44.140]  More than half thought the U.S.
[02:24:44.180 --> 02:24:46.441]  should leave within six months, and 29% said the U.S.
[02:24:46.461 --> 02:24:47.922]  should leave immediately.
[02:24:48.322 --> 02:24:55.127]  That's what the commander-in-chief and the vice president, both of whom avoided having to fight in Vietnam, like to call cutting and running.
[02:24:55.993 --> 02:25:03.075]  The Zogby poll results should be big news, but it didn't make most of the mainstream papers or the major TV news programs.
[02:25:03.135 --> 02:25:06.476]  It did make Infowars.com and PrisonBlinded.com last Friday.
[02:25:07.016 --> 02:25:13.018]  A spokesman at Zogby said, philosophically, this is the kind of story that has a long shelf life.
[02:25:13.038 --> 02:25:17.019]  These are the sort of kinds of opinions that shift up and down rapidly.
[02:25:17.379 --> 02:25:21.240]  They are strongly held opinions being expressed by troops who we interviewed.
[02:25:22.933 --> 02:25:26.516]  So these are not the kinds of opinions that shift up and down rapidly.
[02:25:26.636 --> 02:25:28.838]  Well, don't expect to hear that anywhere.
[02:25:29.158 --> 02:25:31.040]  The troops want us to stay!
[02:25:31.240 --> 02:25:33.342]  The troops won't finish the job, Alex!
[02:25:33.702 --> 02:25:35.184]  Shut up, you dirty commie!
[02:25:36.144 --> 02:25:38.667]  But actually, Bush has spent more money than all presidents combined.
[02:25:38.907 --> 02:25:39.968]  It's for a war!
[02:25:40.088 --> 02:25:41.029]  No, most of it isn't.
[02:25:41.069 --> 02:25:42.470]  It's big government programs.
[02:25:42.490 --> 02:25:44.051]  He doubled the size of the BATF.
[02:25:44.552 --> 02:25:45.112]  Liar!
[02:25:45.553 --> 02:25:46.814]  He was for the assault of his band.
[02:25:46.854 --> 02:25:47.975]  Here's a mainstream news article.
[02:25:48.235 --> 02:25:49.316]  That's a lie, too!
[02:25:50.100 --> 02:25:51.320]  And then they finally hear that he did it.
[02:25:51.460 --> 02:25:52.881]  All right, well, we need to.
[02:25:52.941 --> 02:25:53.681]  We need to.
[02:25:54.281 --> 02:25:55.521]  You don't care about America.
[02:25:55.541 --> 02:25:59.762]  You care about toadying around that Kenny Bunkport, Maine, fake Texas.
[02:26:00.562 --> 02:26:04.303]  You like watching him on the cowboy set strut around when he's afraid of horses.
[02:26:04.923 --> 02:26:06.283]  I mean, it's just all fake.
[02:26:06.763 --> 02:26:08.183]  And I, for one, am sick of it!
[02:26:08.203 --> 02:26:11.564]  All right, really serious news now.
[02:26:12.864 --> 02:26:15.925]  For about a hundred years, they've had instruments that were delicate enough to...
[02:26:16.897 --> 02:26:17.538]  We're good to go.
[02:26:17.558 --> 02:26:17.878]  I think?
[02:26:43.092 --> 02:26:50.697]  But the globalists are going to use it as hysteria to give us all sorts of global taxes on fossil fuels that have nothing to do with stopping global warming.
[02:26:51.217 --> 02:26:57.241]  Which we're definitely in the middle of climate change, but some areas are getting colder, some are getting hotter, and that's the human cycle.
[02:26:57.801 --> 02:26:59.962]  You know, 6,000 year old histories talk about that.
[02:27:00.483 --> 02:27:02.844]  Well, this is out of Reuters, and this is scary.
[02:27:03.544 --> 02:27:07.767]  This is scary because we had the biggest sun cycle recorded in the last 100 years.
[02:27:08.347 --> 02:27:11.629]  The last 11-year cycle ended about a year ago and got worse.
[02:27:11.649 --> 02:27:12.290]  It didn't get better.
[02:27:12.830 --> 02:27:16.052]  And now they're saying it's going to be 50% stronger, it looks like.
[02:27:16.653 --> 02:27:18.093]  We'll tell you about this when we get back.
[02:27:18.194 --> 02:27:22.236]  It is big news because it triggers volcanoes.
[02:27:22.736 --> 02:27:23.897]  It triggers earthquakes.
[02:27:24.398 --> 02:27:25.638]  It triggers global warming.
[02:27:25.718 --> 02:27:26.719]  Yes, the sun.
[02:27:27.099 --> 02:27:29.501]  Thousands and thousands of times bigger than the Earth.
[02:27:31.400 --> 02:27:32.761]  And it's heating up.
[02:27:33.141 --> 02:27:34.001]  It's getting bigger.
[02:27:36.382 --> 02:27:37.263]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.763 --> 02:27:39.363]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.304 --> 02:27:42.965]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.678 --> 02:27:53.540]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[02:27:53.680 --> 02:28:06.603]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[02:28:06.803 --> 02:28:08.563]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[02:28:08.763 --> 02:28:12.224]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[02:28:12.504 --> 02:28:16.286]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[02:28:16.546 --> 02:28:21.508]  Whatever it is you seek, Zango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[02:28:21.768 --> 02:28:23.488]  So take matters into your own hands.
[02:28:23.749 --> 02:28:27.710]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[02:28:27.730 --> 02:28:29.791]  Zango is what you are looking for.

[02:29:50.872 --> 02:29:58.679]  RxDrugCard.com is a simple, innovative program designed to give individuals the same purchasing power as large HMOs and insurance companies.

[02:30:09.008 --> 02:30:10.069]  We're good to go.
[02:30:30.081 --> 02:30:32.942]  So the sun is going, I want to say critical, but it doesn't look good.
[02:30:59.848 --> 02:31:02.570]  But don't worry, they're going to have you blaming your car for it.
[02:31:03.771 --> 02:31:11.936]  The sun's mass is around, this is according to NASA's website, 333,000 times Earth's mass.
[02:31:11.996 --> 02:31:17.260]  An object at the sun's surface would weigh 28 times as much as it does on Earth's surface.
[02:31:19.113 --> 02:31:21.054]  And the sun is 1,391,000 kilometers in diameter.
[02:31:21.074 --> 02:31:21.895]  That's 862,400 miles in diameter.
[02:31:22.015 --> 02:31:24.496]  The earth is 12,742 kilometers, or 7,900 miles in diameter.
[02:31:24.516 --> 02:31:28.158]  So the sun is 333,000 times its mass, and of course many, many, many thousands of times, hundreds of thousands of times larger.
[02:31:28.178 --> 02:31:28.238]  Now...
[02:31:46.480 --> 02:31:52.309]  I just thought I'd pull that up and cover that before I got into this article, because this is the type of serious stuff that's going on.
[02:31:53.370 --> 02:31:55.213]  We need to figure out we don't control everything.
[02:31:56.235 --> 02:31:59.276]  Sun's next 11-year cycle could be 50% stronger.
[02:31:59.376 --> 02:31:59.776]  Reuters.
[02:31:59.896 --> 02:32:13.219]  Sun-spawned cosmic storms that can play havoc with earthly power grids and orbiting satellites could be 50% stronger in the next 11-year solar cycle than in the last one, scientists said Monday.
[02:32:13.259 --> 02:32:15.960]  And they thought this last cycle was the biggest ever.
[02:32:16.160 --> 02:32:16.520]  Record it.
[02:32:16.980 --> 02:32:18.181]  Well, it was the biggest ever recorded.
[02:32:18.241 --> 02:32:19.462]  It'll now be dwarfed, they're saying.
[02:32:19.923 --> 02:32:27.890]  Using a new model that takes into account what happens under the sun's surface and data about previous solar cycles, astronomers offered a long-range forecast.
[02:32:28.671 --> 02:32:30.372]  And again, they already think the sun's going crazy.
[02:32:30.792 --> 02:32:35.457]  For solar activity that could start as soon as the year or as late as 2008.
[02:32:35.537 --> 02:32:37.398]  So it could start this year or 08.
[02:32:38.719 --> 02:32:39.160]  They offered...
[02:32:40.114 --> 02:32:50.596]  No specific predictions on solar storms, but the hope to formulate early warnings that will give power companies, satellite operators and others on and around Earth a few days to prepare.
[02:32:51.457 --> 02:33:10.753]  This prediction of an active solar cycle suggests we're potentially looking at more communications disruptions, more satellite failures, possible disruptions of electric grids and blackouts, more dangerous conditions for astronauts, said Richard Benuck of the Upper Atmospheric Research Section of the National Science Foundation.
[02:33:12.276 --> 02:33:19.580]  Predicting and understanding space weather will soon be even more vital than ever, Benek said at a telephone news briefing.
[02:33:19.721 --> 02:33:25.884]  The prediction, roughly analogous to the early predictions of severe hurricane seasons on Earth, what do you think is causing it?
[02:33:25.944 --> 02:33:26.465]  It's the sun.
[02:33:26.485 --> 02:33:35.030]  It involves the number of sunspots on the surface of the solar mass phenomenon that have been monitored for more than a century.
[02:33:35.430 --> 02:33:39.292]  Twisted magnetic fields, by the way, the field of the Earth is now moving.
[02:33:41.013 --> 02:33:41.454]  They've never...
[02:33:42.369 --> 02:33:43.885]  They've never recorded that yet.
[02:33:44.574 --> 02:33:49.717]  Every 11 years or so, the sun goes through an active period with lots of sunspots.
[02:33:49.777 --> 02:33:58.781]  This is important since solar storms linked to twisted magnetic fields that can hurl out energetic particles tend to occur near sunspots.
[02:33:59.461 --> 02:34:04.964]  The sun is in a relatively quiet period now, but is expected to get more active soon, scientists said.
[02:34:05.004 --> 02:34:13.148]  However, there is a disagreement as to whether the active period will start within months, late 06, or early 07, or years with the first signs in late 07-08.
[02:34:14.941 --> 02:34:24.963]  And, of course, they just totally sidestepped earthquakes, volcanic activity.
[02:34:26.163 --> 02:34:33.544]  They just completely ignored that when all the major studies show that it's directly in relationship to it.
[02:34:33.584 --> 02:34:34.324]  I mean, obviously.
[02:34:34.364 --> 02:34:39.285]  You've got all this energy hitting the rock that is the earth and heating it up.
[02:34:39.545 --> 02:34:43.466]  It's going to cause all sorts of problems, and it does things in the atmosphere.
[02:34:44.500 --> 02:34:45.782]  Now, forget the sun.
[02:34:45.843 --> 02:34:47.105]  We have volcanoes.
[02:34:48.387 --> 02:34:55.159]  And almost every ancient civilization had whole cities covered instantly by ash, by lava, by rock.
[02:34:57.117 --> 02:35:01.018]  And we know the volcanoes are getting a lot more active all over the world.
[02:35:01.238 --> 02:35:15.161]  Record levels of volcanoes recorded in the last 300 years of modern circumnavigation and reports of different volcanic activities that they have been marking down longer in recording than they have sun activity.
[02:35:16.961 --> 02:35:18.141]  That's just the last 100 years.
[02:35:18.321 --> 02:35:19.101]  And they're going crazy.
[02:35:19.141 --> 02:35:26.143]  I mean, remember the 9.2 out in the Pacific Rim with the great tsunamis of December of...
[02:35:27.445 --> 02:35:29.986]  Of 04 into 05, remember that?
[02:35:30.627 --> 02:35:32.628]  I mean, it's going wild right now.
[02:35:32.668 --> 02:35:34.149]  They're having earthquakes in New York.
[02:35:34.169 --> 02:35:36.310]  They're having earthquakes in the middle of the country.
[02:35:36.330 --> 02:35:39.111]  I mean, we are really... I mean, this is real.
[02:35:39.151 --> 02:35:39.832]  This isn't hype.
[02:35:39.852 --> 02:35:41.552]  This isn't bird flu hoax.
[02:35:41.632 --> 02:35:45.114]  This isn't all the rest of the stuff people are running around pulling their hair out about.
[02:35:45.134 --> 02:35:45.454]  You know me.
[02:35:45.514 --> 02:35:46.375]  I don't get up here.
[02:35:46.815 --> 02:35:48.556]  The show is not about earth changes, okay?
[02:35:49.737 --> 02:35:51.878]  This stuff is a cycle we've got to pay attention to.
[02:35:52.418 --> 02:35:56.180]  But they'll use these normal changes in the sun that affects the earth...
[02:35:58.269 --> 02:36:01.171]  To have a hysteria that, oh, the answer is a global tax on fuel.
[02:36:01.631 --> 02:36:08.216]  It'll do nothing to conserve fuel, nothing to get us off energy dependence, which I'm concerned about, nothing to stop these international cartels, nothing.
[02:36:08.276 --> 02:36:12.359]  Just, oh, there's a problem, the earth's heating up, so we'll just charge you more.
[02:36:12.379 --> 02:36:20.225]  I mean, the Kyoto Protocol, 167 countries have to make zero cuts, and we have to make all the cuts.
[02:36:21.346 --> 02:36:22.967]  You think our jobs have already gone overseas?
[02:36:23.007 --> 02:36:23.808]  Wait till that happens.
[02:36:25.791 --> 02:36:27.252]  Think Pompeii got hit hard.
[02:36:27.292 --> 02:36:28.493]  Worse eruptions work.
[02:36:28.573 --> 02:36:28.973]  Reuters.
[02:36:29.774 --> 02:36:43.604]  The preserved footprints in abandoned homes of villagers who fled a giant eruption of Mount Vesuvius 3,800 years ago show the volcano could destroy modern-day Naples with little warning, Italian and U.S.
[02:36:43.644 --> 02:36:45.085]  researchers reported on Monday.
[02:36:45.566 --> 02:36:55.153]  The eruption buried entire villages as far as 15 miles from the volcano, cooking people as they tried to escape and dumping several feet of ash and mud.
[02:36:55.808 --> 02:37:00.571]  Yeah, they brought some of the actual encased bodies to the exhibit I saw in Dallas when I was a lad.
[02:37:01.732 --> 02:37:14.641]  And there they were, babies, women, husbands, just frozen in agony with their hands reaching up, trying to crawl, encased in lava and ash.
[02:37:16.210 --> 02:37:18.131]  I'm sure it was global warming back then that caused it.
[02:37:18.392 --> 02:37:19.953]  I'm sure it was all those automobiles.
[02:37:19.973 --> 02:37:25.999]  And of course, a major eruption like Vesuvius, they've done studies on Krakatoa and others, Mount St.
[02:37:26.019 --> 02:37:30.923]  Helens, which is relatively small, puts out more than all cars have put out in 100 years combined.
[02:37:30.943 --> 02:37:33.005]  But again, don't confuse me with the facts.
[02:37:33.486 --> 02:37:40.432]  Let's put algae, genetically engineered in the ocean, that creates more CO2, and then it starts spreading everywhere and really causing global warming.
[02:37:40.652 --> 02:37:42.733]  Let's not worry about something that's really devastating.
[02:37:43.033 --> 02:37:44.554]  No, that's not a problem.
[02:37:44.854 --> 02:37:53.257]  No, let's not worry about the sun or earthquakes or tectonic shifts or huge gas ejections.
[02:37:54.697 --> 02:37:56.038]  Not gas, gas.
[02:37:58.239 --> 02:38:00.520]  I try to hurry and fumble over myself.
[02:38:01.140 --> 02:38:06.122]  New excavations show far more extensive damage than that found at the more famous site of Pompeii.
[02:38:07.023 --> 02:38:08.004]  We're good to go.
[02:38:35.425 --> 02:38:39.166]  But in the last few years, they've showed some seismic activity brewing.
[02:38:39.566 --> 02:38:44.307]  Not saying anything's going to happen, but the point is that stuff's heating up because the sun is heating up.
[02:38:45.748 --> 02:38:50.769]  Evidence shows that a sudden in-mass evacuation of thousands of people occurred at the beginning of the eruption.
[02:38:52.809 --> 02:39:03.292]  Giuseppe Mastronovs and colleagues at the Institut National of Volcanology
[02:39:04.557 --> 02:39:05.838]  I'm not going to try those next words.
[02:39:06.539 --> 02:39:15.068]  Everything was there, added Michael Sheridan, a geologist and hazard assessment expert at the University at Buffalo in New York who worked on the study.
[02:39:15.648 --> 02:39:18.051]  They even left animals in cages, it goes on.
[02:39:18.592 --> 02:39:19.773]  Okay, enough on that.
[02:39:21.014 --> 02:39:23.256]  But we should do an article about real threats.
[02:39:23.957 --> 02:39:24.678]  I mean, you think that 9.2...
[02:39:26.573 --> 02:39:27.113]  Was bad.
[02:39:27.674 --> 02:39:30.435]  History's recorded earthquakes much larger.
[02:39:30.475 --> 02:39:35.217]  Though that's the biggest earthquake ever recorded on the Richter scale, Richter scale is about 100 years old.
[02:39:36.737 --> 02:39:37.098]  Okay?
[02:39:38.138 --> 02:39:46.802]  And the type of things that have been recorded and described and what the geological record shows is 500-foot chasms forming, whole cities disappearing.
[02:39:47.662 --> 02:39:50.843]  I mean, we're talking about things on a Richter scale that are 15, 18.
[02:39:52.024 --> 02:39:54.305]  Remember, it doubles exponentially each time.
[02:39:55.608 --> 02:39:58.310]  A 10 is double what a 9 is.
[02:39:59.411 --> 02:40:12.939]  A 11 is... It's like they had to now expand the hurricane indices because now these hurricanes hitting the Gulf and the Caribbean are off the charts.
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:15.421]  They're bigger than Category 5.
[02:40:15.641 --> 02:40:16.342]  They're Category 6.
[02:40:17.122 --> 02:40:22.606]  They go 180 miles an hour and they just say, well, we'll call it a typhoon because typhoons can go up to 280 miles an hour.
[02:40:25.794 --> 02:40:26.094]  Oh, boy.
[02:40:27.695 --> 02:40:29.796]  So you think that 9.2 is something?
[02:40:31.017 --> 02:40:37.981]  Geologists are saying we could see Richter scale busting events very soon because the tectonic plates are very squirrely.
[02:40:39.202 --> 02:40:41.423]  Yellowstone is sinking and then rising.
[02:40:42.003 --> 02:40:53.270]  The whole thing is a giant cone of a volcano, a mega volcano, that literally, bare minimum, if there was an eruption, the four corners, those four states that come together...
[02:40:54.221 --> 02:40:55.102]  We'll call it the Four Corps.
[02:40:55.122 --> 02:40:55.863]  What do they call that?
[02:40:56.823 --> 02:41:01.607]  All I know is I've been there, and a bunch of states are right there in that area, and I've seen the different geological maps.
[02:41:02.008 --> 02:41:03.649]  And I'm not trying to scare people there.
[02:41:03.669 --> 02:41:06.412]  I mean, we're talking about bye-bye to those states.
[02:41:06.432 --> 02:41:07.873]  We're talking about everybody being dead.
[02:41:08.774 --> 02:41:12.757]  And that's mainstream news, so I'm not trying to scare people.
[02:41:13.858 --> 02:41:18.322]  The point is that this is not being caused by your automobile.
[02:41:20.177 --> 02:41:21.178]  They've done the math.
[02:41:21.218 --> 02:41:36.428]  They've done the conversion rates, calculating all the gas burned from industry and cars, and they multiply it towards the yearly rate of gas being expelled, the same gases, out of volcanoes, and it doesn't even register.
[02:41:38.210 --> 02:41:41.672]  It isn't even a fraction of it.
[02:41:42.930 --> 02:41:44.331]  It doesn't even fit into it.
[02:41:44.371 --> 02:41:47.233]  So, I'm not here saying global warming isn't real.
[02:41:47.293 --> 02:41:48.914]  I'm not saying there isn't a climate crisis.
[02:41:49.314 --> 02:41:50.535]  I'm not saying there aren't problems.
[02:41:50.595 --> 02:41:54.577]  But what you're... Again, the globalist solution is an absolute joke.
[02:41:54.617 --> 02:41:58.540]  It's the equivalent of polishing silverware on the deck of the Titanic.
[02:42:01.252 --> 02:42:02.793]  Now, the elite are prepared for all this.
[02:42:02.853 --> 02:42:05.034]  They've got alternate bases all over the world.
[02:42:05.074 --> 02:42:06.134]  They've got underground bases.
[02:42:06.154 --> 02:42:13.137]  They've got underground railways all over the country and all over this hemisphere and in Europe, and the Russians have built them.
[02:42:13.397 --> 02:42:14.398]  But that's not for you.
[02:42:14.498 --> 02:42:15.698]  You paid for those.
[02:42:16.199 --> 02:42:17.859]  But that's for the elite scumbags.
[02:42:17.879 --> 02:42:18.720]  I thought you'd want to know that.
[02:42:20.240 --> 02:42:22.121]  Take a few calls, and I'll get back in the news.
[02:42:22.802 --> 02:42:24.742]  Chris in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:42:24.782 --> 02:42:25.083]  Go ahead.
[02:42:25.123 --> 02:42:26.043]  You disagree, I'm told.
[02:42:27.987 --> 02:42:28.507]  Yes, Alex.
[02:42:28.527 --> 02:42:29.448]  You go to the head of the line.
[02:42:29.488 --> 02:42:30.108]  What's on your mind?
[02:42:31.488 --> 02:42:36.290]  I hear so many times, I don't know what you mean exactly about the New Age being dangerous.
[02:42:38.491 --> 02:42:51.996]  I understand that you're mentioning the Aztec calendar, but I just wanted to point out that I find it's a lot easier to persuade people when you practice calmness, like you said, going inside yourself.
[02:42:53.404 --> 02:42:58.027]  I didn't understand what you meant by that when you said that people talk about going inside yourself.
[02:42:59.328 --> 02:43:02.710]  Well, I mean, I'll simplify everything, and I'm not trying to attack you, sir.
[02:43:02.811 --> 02:43:03.891]  I said dangerous.
[02:43:04.572 --> 02:43:05.452]  I mean, I'm a Christian.
[02:43:05.512 --> 02:43:07.854]  Going into these mainstream churches is dangerous.
[02:43:08.834 --> 02:43:13.998]  And I think that what we call the new age, I mean, I know that there's nothing new about it,
[02:43:14.691 --> 02:43:23.244]  And in most of the traditions that grow out of the New Age, or that the New Age grows out of, human sacrifice and enslavement is there.
[02:43:23.994 --> 02:43:26.515]  And so it's not bad to obviously meditate.
[02:43:26.555 --> 02:43:31.037]  By meditate, I don't mean like a yogi, but I mean analyze yourself, think, calm down.
[02:43:31.117 --> 02:43:31.718]  I need to do it.
[02:43:31.778 --> 02:43:34.719]  I'm actually a pretty calm person when I'm not on air.
[02:43:34.779 --> 02:43:35.559]  Ask people that know me.
[02:43:36.580 --> 02:43:46.504]  But by going inside themselves, I mean people that think they're going to change the world by literally meditating, bending spoons, levitating, I mean that type of mumbo-jumbo.
[02:43:46.964 --> 02:43:50.466]  Yeah, I'm sure you couldn't do your job if you weren't very calm.
[02:43:51.498 --> 02:43:54.339]  When you're not doing, when you're not public, you know, public.
[02:43:54.379 --> 02:43:56.540]  But not always by design.
[02:43:56.560 --> 02:43:58.081]  I mean, I'm pretty calm in person.
[02:43:58.341 --> 02:43:59.521]  I get hyper when I'm working.
[02:44:00.222 --> 02:44:00.442]  Right.
[02:44:00.862 --> 02:44:01.662]  And that's what it takes.
[02:44:01.702 --> 02:44:03.783]  That's what it really calls for.
[02:44:03.843 --> 02:44:13.227]  If you want to persuade people who actually resonate with calmness and who can be calm, then they can look at the facts a little better.
[02:44:13.267 --> 02:44:15.528]  I mean, it's easier to persuade those type of people.
[02:44:16.348 --> 02:44:17.069]  I'll say this.
[02:44:18.609 --> 02:44:21.630]  Some of the New Age crowd out there, they're concerned about the New World Order.
[02:44:21.931 --> 02:44:23.571]  They're concerned about the earth being poisoned.
[02:44:23.591 --> 02:44:25.092]  They're concerned about a lot of real issues.
[02:44:25.432 --> 02:44:29.774]  A lot of Christians are tied in with it.
[02:44:30.094 --> 02:44:36.236]  But I'm saying it's a great recruiting ground for a large part of the New Age that is a cultic religion.
[02:44:36.316 --> 02:44:38.157]  I think it's very bad, very dangerous.
[02:44:38.197 --> 02:44:39.058]  Now, I'm not a preacher.
[02:44:39.458 --> 02:44:40.498]  I'm not up here preaching.
[02:44:40.838 --> 02:44:44.820]  I just know my experiences dealing with these people, dealing with them in everyday life,
[02:44:45.240 --> 02:44:50.324]  Being around people that are into this stuff, and their tree doesn't bear very good fruit, brother.
[02:44:50.764 --> 02:44:58.530]  Don't let them be a bad representation of what actually is possible and what your soul is capable of directing God's energy.
[02:44:58.570 --> 02:44:59.631]  And, of course, you know about that.
[02:44:59.671 --> 02:45:06.617]  But, you know, you can learn to direct God's energy and do so much good directing energy into other people.
[02:45:06.717 --> 02:45:12.281]  Well, I think God directing you is what I believe.
[02:45:12.321 --> 02:45:14.943]  I don't think I'm directing God's energy.
[02:45:16.556 --> 02:45:19.420]  Well, there is a user free will in order to do that.
[02:45:19.480 --> 02:45:28.130]  And I mean, giving God all the credit is really what it's all about in order to perhaps see what the most appropriate action is at the time.
[02:45:28.190 --> 02:45:32.035]  I mean, you look at our legal system and you see the principle of voting.
[02:45:32.856 --> 02:45:35.079]  Now, that shows how the group influenced
[02:45:36.443 --> 02:45:40.205]  On how the group behaves is really sacred to me.
[02:45:40.265 --> 02:45:42.246]  That's a sacred principle to me.
[02:45:42.686 --> 02:45:45.367]  And that's what it is, and that's why the globalists are trying to subvert it.
[02:45:45.407 --> 02:45:46.068]  Thanks for the call.
[02:45:46.088 --> 02:45:46.948]  We're almost out of time.
[02:45:47.468 --> 02:45:47.848]  Okay?
[02:45:48.349 --> 02:45:49.469]  I appreciate that, sir.
[02:45:50.109 --> 02:45:53.071]  Let's go ahead and talk to Robert in San Diego.
[02:45:53.111 --> 02:45:53.791]  Go ahead, Robert.
[02:45:54.331 --> 02:45:55.072]  Yes, thank you, Alex.
[02:45:55.132 --> 02:45:56.652]  I'll try to get to my point really quick.
[02:45:57.853 --> 02:46:02.895]  This Mayan calendar thing, it just indicates that we know that there exist long-term cycles.
[02:46:03.305 --> 02:46:09.672]  So the problem, reaction, solution is they know these cycles are coming up and then they blame it on us for using the cars that they sell us gas for.
[02:46:09.712 --> 02:46:10.612]  It's really ridiculous.
[02:46:10.793 --> 02:46:16.398]  And then people think it's the moon men causing it when it's a cycle, yeah.
[02:46:16.579 --> 02:46:19.341]  Yeah, all these cults monitor that, you know, just as a side product.
[02:46:19.822 --> 02:46:24.407]  But, you know, the Oscars really celebrated homosexuality.
[02:46:24.907 --> 02:46:25.708]  That's one of my points.
[02:46:27.068 --> 02:46:30.910]  You know, my point is, why are they always trying to cram it down our throats?
[02:46:31.010 --> 02:46:33.831]  That was just in your face all the way.
[02:46:34.351 --> 02:46:37.012]  I mean, listen, I don't even get into people's business.
[02:46:37.332 --> 02:46:39.753]  I just want my family and me to be left alone, but it's no.
[02:46:40.134 --> 02:46:41.434]  No, no, you're going to do this.
[02:46:41.454 --> 02:46:42.375]  You're going to talk about it.
[02:46:42.395 --> 02:46:44.375]  You're going to give us attention.
[02:46:44.635 --> 02:46:47.277]  I mean, I don't like anybody that does that, and I'm sick of it.
[02:46:48.197 --> 02:46:52.399]  My second point was, you know, when people hear about camps in the United States and the 911 inside job,
[02:46:53.615 --> 02:47:00.661]  They just traditionally go through the four stages of, you know, death and denial, depression, anger, before they can get to acceptance.
[02:47:00.681 --> 02:47:02.823]  That's what I hear so much when other callers call in.
[02:47:02.843 --> 02:47:05.005]  Oh, no, that's what's happening with everybody.
[02:47:05.226 --> 02:47:07.207]  And everybody I know is just getting to acceptance now.
[02:47:07.247 --> 02:47:08.689]  It's just, oh, yes, they did it all.
[02:47:08.709 --> 02:47:09.369]  Of course they did it.
[02:47:09.389 --> 02:47:10.290]  I mean, it's just mainstream.
[02:47:10.410 --> 02:47:10.851]  Oh, yes.
[02:47:11.624 --> 02:47:13.764]  And that's the one thing I'm really proud of.
[02:47:14.085 --> 02:47:15.565]  I mean, folks, I'm proud of that.
[02:47:16.005 --> 02:47:23.167]  I'm proud as a testament that I stood firm, that I talked about it first, that I got attacked, and that I was the first to talk about it.
[02:47:23.187 --> 02:47:23.727]  I'm proud of that.
[02:47:23.887 --> 02:47:24.587]  Well, you woke me up.
[02:47:24.647 --> 02:47:25.387]  It took four years.
[02:47:25.427 --> 02:47:26.287]  It was very painful.
[02:47:26.307 --> 02:47:29.488]  I remember the first year, I couldn't hardly deal with it.
[02:47:29.588 --> 02:47:30.448]  It was that traumatic.
[02:47:30.748 --> 02:47:33.469]  But my second point is our favorite government program, 24...
[02:47:34.748 --> 02:47:37.310]  Have you been following up their two-hour special last night?
[02:47:37.370 --> 02:47:38.991]  No, I read the synopsis occasionally.
[02:47:39.011 --> 02:47:51.601]  Quickly, you know, the terrorists have VX gas, and the president sells out his wife's limousine path to the airport with the president of Russia in it so the terrorists can blow it up, or they're going to release 19 canisters of VX nerve gas in America.
[02:47:52.081 --> 02:47:52.962]  He sells out his wife.
[02:47:53.022 --> 02:48:02.169]  Second part is Jack Bauer gets to torture his ex-boss by, get this, shooting his wife in the leg, just like that one guy said, we're going to torture your kids in front of you.
[02:48:03.151 --> 02:48:07.114]  So they proved it right there on 24 that they're going to torture his wife to make the terrorists talk.
[02:48:07.214 --> 02:48:08.996]  Well, see, they're warping the mass mine.
[02:48:09.016 --> 02:48:10.837]  They're giving us the mine of Negroponte.
[02:48:11.017 --> 02:48:12.839]  Yeah, that's all I could think of as soon as I saw that.
[02:48:13.520 --> 02:48:23.788]  And then yesterday, right here in the north county of San Diego, they said there was a shootout with an old veteran in an apartment complex four blocks away from where my kids go to a charter school.
[02:48:24.168 --> 02:48:29.072]  So they kept my charter school locked down for five hours and made me pick him up five hours late.
[02:48:29.373 --> 02:48:31.154]  Oh, the veteran wouldn't hand him in.
[02:48:31.174 --> 02:48:32.135]  Did they gun him down?
[02:48:33.217 --> 02:48:35.079]  Going on this morning, I haven't heard the result of it.
[02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:36.902]  No, well I'm sure that I did.
[02:48:36.922 --> 02:48:38.944]  As soon as I heard it, I went, oh, that's a psy-op.
[02:48:39.044 --> 02:48:39.765]  Total psy-op.
[02:48:39.825 --> 02:48:40.746]  Four blocks away.
[02:48:41.067 --> 02:48:45.532]  Oh, they love surrounding old Korean and Vietnam vets and killing them.
[02:48:45.552 --> 02:48:46.213]  That's what real men do.
[02:48:47.566 --> 02:48:50.408]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:50.669 --> 02:48:51.369]  Hello, my friends.

[02:53:15.143 --> 02:53:16.244]  Thanks for letting me talk about this.
[02:53:16.264 --> 02:53:17.905]  I just wanted to mention, as I said...
[02:53:41.628 --> 02:53:46.959]  Your earlier caller had talked about how little it takes sometimes to be classified as a sex offender these days.
[02:53:48.042 --> 02:53:52.270]  And there's a case here in Austin where a young lady was
[02:53:53.183 --> 02:53:55.125]  And by the way, I've seen those bumper stickers.
[02:53:55.145 --> 02:53:56.907]  It's part of the Restaurant Association.
[02:53:57.007 --> 02:53:58.428]  It was the dirtiness of the cop's mind.
[02:53:58.448 --> 02:53:59.689]  It's eating out is fun.
[02:54:15.124 --> 02:54:17.166]  And, I mean, going out to eat is fun.
[02:54:17.706 --> 02:54:20.928]  But he turned that into something, and actually I heard about that case.
[02:54:20.948 --> 02:54:21.909]  That was in the news.
[02:54:22.369 --> 02:54:23.910]  I remember that a few months ago.
[02:54:24.390 --> 02:54:26.512]  And, man, I mean, just look, look, look.
[02:54:27.232 --> 02:54:31.695]  Making a $650 payment on your credit card, Homeland Security's watching you.
[02:54:32.036 --> 02:54:33.256]  Arresting homeless people.
[02:54:33.597 --> 02:54:36.499]  All of your prescriptions being uploaded without a warrant.
[02:54:36.599 --> 02:54:38.120]  This is police state, my friend.
[02:54:38.420 --> 02:54:42.943]  Well, and this lady is the epitome of a good citizen, you know, a good contributing citizen.
[02:54:45.700 --> 02:54:46.321]  They don't care.
[02:54:46.541 --> 02:54:48.221]  The government's criminal, sir.
[02:54:48.281 --> 02:54:49.262]  They're criminal.
[02:54:49.322 --> 02:54:50.943]  It's about getting us in their system.
[02:54:51.343 --> 02:54:53.184]  Well, goodbye to the open society.
[02:54:53.224 --> 02:54:57.846]  I need to start wearing my black armband for the downfall of democracy in this country.
[02:54:57.866 --> 02:55:01.047]  We need to stand up to this scum and let them know we're not going to be part of their insanity.
[02:55:01.367 --> 02:55:06.849]  We've got a lot of friends in the police force, a lot of friends in the military, a lot of people in government know what's going on.
[02:55:06.869 --> 02:55:07.470]  Thanks for the call.
[02:55:08.030 --> 02:55:09.911]  But we cannot be buffaloed by these bullies.
[02:55:09.931 --> 02:55:12.672]  They're taking the gloves off right now to try to intimidate us.
[02:55:13.206 --> 02:55:14.748]  Because they've got a grand finale coming.
[02:55:14.808 --> 02:55:17.030]  I mean, the tyranny hadn't even begun, folks.
[02:55:18.332 --> 02:55:19.593]  Let's take a final call.
[02:55:19.633 --> 02:55:20.394]  Jim in New York.
[02:55:20.675 --> 02:55:21.015]  Go ahead.
[02:55:21.075 --> 02:55:21.816]  You're our tail gunner.
[02:55:22.036 --> 02:55:22.497]  Hello, Alex.
[02:55:23.298 --> 02:55:27.362]  What I wanted to ask you is that yesterday I went to the GCNY shows.
[02:55:27.422 --> 02:55:33.629]  I heard something about the 101st Airborne being deployed to Iraq, the whole division, not just...
[02:55:34.502 --> 02:55:35.143]  You know, in increments.
[02:55:35.203 --> 02:55:36.103]  Do you know anything about that?
[02:55:36.144 --> 02:55:38.806]  I don't know about that specifically, but there have been massive troop movements.
[02:55:38.926 --> 02:55:43.510]  A build-up is happening, not a build-down, in Iraq and in surrounding areas.
[02:55:43.550 --> 02:55:46.593]  The Marines are off the shore right now.
[02:55:47.153 --> 02:55:50.757]  They're from Iran, and there is a major build-up.
[02:55:50.837 --> 02:55:52.518]  The DU weapons are being shipped in.
[02:55:52.538 --> 02:55:54.380]  There's a major build-up for a strike.
