[00:00:05.516 --> 00:00:06.156]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.816 --> 00:00:07.876]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.597 --> 00:00:09.697]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.337 --> 00:00:11.157]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.918 --> 00:00:12.838]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.498 --> 00:00:17.139]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.781]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.282 --> 00:00:27.903]  Well, it feels like a Monday.
[00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:30.427]  But it's really Tuesday.
[00:00:30.487 --> 00:00:33.590]  I just got back to Austin, Texas last night.
[00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:34.771]  I had a chance to see the family.
[00:00:35.436 --> 00:00:37.738]  Been in Los Angeles since last Wednesday night.
[00:00:37.758 --> 00:00:41.160]  We had an extremely successful 9-11 Truth Conference.
[00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:49.486]  The biggest and most informative ever, according to all of the attendees that we talked to, including the people that were on the panel, our different speakers.
[00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.407]  And all the glory goes to God.
[00:00:51.467 --> 00:00:58.572]  It was a wonderful, informative, historical event that got a lot of international and national news coverage.
[00:00:59.113 --> 00:01:03.456]  C-SPAN was there and taped, I'm told, for two hours, and that'll be airing sometime this week.
[00:01:03.476 --> 00:01:04.877]  We shall have to ascertain when.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.502]  We're told it will air at least three times, though.
[00:01:08.864 --> 00:01:12.708]  I want to open the phones up to give you, the listeners, a chance to talk about all the things that have happened.
[00:01:13.468 --> 00:01:17.793]  We have, of course, seen the staged events in England, Canada, and Florida here in the U.S.
[00:01:18.293 --> 00:01:19.355]  with Patsy's.
[00:01:19.395 --> 00:01:22.878]  We'll be going over that and why the government is engaging in this.
[00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.183]  We'll also play about a seven-minute clip of Charlie Sheen introducing myself.
[00:01:27.922 --> 00:01:41.352]  Coming up later in the week we'll play large portions of my hour and a half long keynote speech and some of the other speeches that were given by Dr. Bob Bowman, Webster Tarpley, Jim Fetzer and many many others.
[00:01:41.372 --> 00:01:44.194]  9-1-1 Conspiracy Theories
[00:01:45.345 --> 00:01:47.227]  Theorists gather at LA Conference.
[00:01:47.267 --> 00:01:49.549]  That is the Reuters headline that got the most attention.
[00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:52.691]  We'll be reading this article on air and commenting on it.
[00:01:53.152 --> 00:01:56.074]  Then of course we have our normal cornucopia of police state news.
[00:01:56.475 --> 00:02:00.938]  Bush ignores laws he inks vexing Congress.
[00:02:01.058 --> 00:02:03.581]  Even laws he passes he says he doesn't have to follow.
[00:02:04.021 --> 00:02:05.462]  This out of the Associated Press.
[00:02:06.523 --> 00:02:09.726]  Transportation Chief Norman Mineta resigns
[00:02:10.916 --> 00:02:16.340]  I will also get into Limbaugh detained at airport and caught with Viagra and other drugs.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.001]  Now, notice the media.
[00:02:18.761 --> 00:02:19.842]  Drudge spun this.
[00:02:19.862 --> 00:02:22.524]  The headline was Limbaugh caught with Viagra.
[00:02:22.544 --> 00:02:23.724]  And I thought, well, that's no big deal.
[00:02:25.506 --> 00:02:28.387]  Even though it's a prescription drug and he didn't have a prescription for it.
[00:02:29.008 --> 00:02:32.630]  So I flipped over to the article and that was amongst other drugs.
[00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.012]  So see, that's how neocons spin it.
[00:02:36.684 --> 00:02:38.605]  I don't care if Rush Limbaugh has painkillers.
[00:02:38.805 --> 00:02:40.586]  I don't care if Rush Limbaugh has Viagra.
[00:02:41.406 --> 00:02:45.628]  I think drug abuse is a serious problem, but it is a disease, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:45.948 --> 00:02:47.529]  Humans have always had trouble with drugs.
[00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.251]  I don't use these drugs, but I believe that you shouldn't be sent to prison for having them.
[00:02:52.271 --> 00:02:53.111]  You should be given help.
[00:02:54.312 --> 00:03:04.296]  And I'll get into the drug war today a little bit when I read this article, but I've heard this big fat, and I mean his soul is fat, I don't mean he's fat, this big fat liar
[00:03:05.246 --> 00:03:14.152]  Over and over again, get up there and attack young people and defend, you know, putting individuals in jail for 10-15 years the first time they're caught with narcotics.
[00:03:15.673 --> 00:03:17.834]  I've heard him defend it going back 15 years.
[00:03:18.655 --> 00:03:28.741]  In fact, I remember 15 years ago listening to Limbaugh when I was still in high school, when I was a senior in high school, and agreeing with him, and Limbaugh manipulating my mind.
[00:03:29.762 --> 00:03:33.104]  And I don't appreciate it, and I don't appreciate him being a hypocrite.
[00:03:33.124 --> 00:03:34.245]  I want him to go to prison!
[00:03:35.163 --> 00:03:37.244]  I demand that he go to prison!
[00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:38.904]  Now, I didn't say this before.
[00:03:39.604 --> 00:03:41.265]  I said, let's forgive him, let's leave him alone.
[00:03:41.305 --> 00:03:51.227]  But here he is, back at it again, and since he got busted with drugs, I have heard him yet again get on air and defend it, but then still call for strong drug laws.
[00:03:51.627 --> 00:03:52.667]  That's it, buddy!
[00:03:53.127 --> 00:03:54.548]  You've been given enough chances.
[00:03:54.948 --> 00:03:56.548]  You need to go to jail!
[00:03:58.609 --> 00:03:59.189]  I'm done!
[00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:00.469]  I'm done with this hypocrite!
[00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:03.350]  I don't know about you, I'm just sick of it!
[00:04:04.065 --> 00:04:05.986]  He's about as conservative as Bill Clinton.
[00:04:06.987 --> 00:04:08.128]  That's how these people operate.
[00:04:08.148 --> 00:04:10.770]  They pose as conservatives to neutralize conservatives.
[00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:17.075]  Limbaugh didn't warn you about Bush's gun-grabbing, about Bush's open border policy, about Bush signing on to the UN and UNESCO.
[00:04:17.455 --> 00:04:21.678]  He just sits there and pacifies people, and he's a hypocrite, and I'm sick of him.
[00:04:22.138 --> 00:04:26.081]  Listen, if you get caught with drugs, and it's non-violent, I don't think you should go to prison, okay?
[00:04:26.682 --> 00:04:29.283]  I'm saying Limbaugh should, because he's a hypocrite.
[00:04:30.544 --> 00:04:31.245]  He really is.
[00:04:32.023 --> 00:04:38.646]  And I can't believe that since he's been busted before, and pled guilty now, that he's still out there promoting the drug war.
[00:04:39.126 --> 00:04:39.686]  That's it.
[00:04:40.126 --> 00:04:44.728]  Throw him into prison and get rid of the key.
[00:04:45.848 --> 00:04:46.729]  Throw away the key.
[00:04:47.369 --> 00:04:47.969]  That is it.
[00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:50.110]  This person is disgusting.
[00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:51.971]  There's nothing sicker.
[00:04:53.011 --> 00:04:57.253]  It's one thing to be a hypocrite, but then to be caught in it and to continue with it, it's just unconscionable.
[00:04:57.273 --> 00:04:58.173]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:02.125 --> 00:05:05.068]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:05:05.728 --> 00:05:07.009]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:12.954]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:05:13.235 --> 00:05:18.499]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:22.883]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:05:23.083 --> 00:05:26.864]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:05:27.124 --> 00:05:31.766]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:05:31.846 --> 00:05:38.107]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:05:38.147 --> 00:05:39.988]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:05:40.468 --> 00:05:42.550]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.
[00:05:42.631 --> 00:05:46.915]  Call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:46.995 --> 00:05:47.576]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:48.517 --> 00:05:54.162]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[00:05:54.283 --> 00:05:56.285]  You see Big Brother's afraid of this documentary.
[00:05:56.525 --> 00:05:58.026]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:05:58.207 --> 00:06:00.269]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:06:02.543 --> 00:06:07.047]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:06:07.387 --> 00:06:11.491]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:06:11.771 --> 00:06:12.332]  We listened.
[00:06:12.632 --> 00:06:17.616]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:06:17.897 --> 00:06:18.377]  We listened.
[00:06:18.757 --> 00:06:21.800]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.741]  We listened.
[00:06:23.201 --> 00:06:27.264]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:06:27.645 --> 00:06:28.145]  We listened.
[00:06:28.485 --> 00:06:33.730]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:35.491]  Again, we listened.
[00:06:35.871 --> 00:06:43.237]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:06:43.638 --> 00:06:47.081]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling
[00:06:52.486 --> 00:06:54.111]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[00:06:54.131 --> 00:06:55.756]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:01.013 --> 00:07:06.997]  I used to be ashamed of my toenails, so I thought I was destined to wear tennis shoes through the heat of the summer and hide my toes at the beach.
[00:07:07.437 --> 00:07:10.079]  And then my podiatrist told me about Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:07:10.239 --> 00:07:14.842]  It tackles unsightly nails by clearing out the cause of the problem, yellowing keratin debris buildup.
[00:07:15.022 --> 00:07:19.846]  With regular use, Non-X Gel breaks down and removes the debris, so toenails look clear.
[00:07:20.026 --> 00:07:24.749]  This summer I'm wearing open-toed sandals again, thanks to a topical natural gel called Non-X.
[00:07:24.969 --> 00:07:27.651]  If your toenails are embarrassing, I recommend Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:07:27.891 --> 00:07:30.773]  It's at your pharmacy or mass retailer in the foot care section.
[00:07:32.053 --> 00:07:33.074]  Looking for profits?
[00:07:33.134 --> 00:07:34.534]  Looking for safety and security?
[00:07:34.974 --> 00:07:38.075]  The $10 Olympic Commemorative Gold Coin offers both.
[00:07:38.115 --> 00:07:45.417]  This low-mintage collector coin, with a total series mintage under $600,000, has sold at four times its current price.
[00:07:45.737 --> 00:07:49.258]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[00:07:49.498 --> 00:07:51.019]  Secure your position today.
[00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:52.519]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:07:52.579 --> 00:07:52.819]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:08:00.848 --> 00:08:05.870]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.511]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:30.249]  We're going to give you in-depth coverage of the historical 9-11 Truth Conference that we had in Los Angeles.
[00:08:31.051 --> 00:08:33.014]  Over 1,200 people ended up attending.
[00:08:34.625 --> 00:08:37.007]  We're going to have Jim Fetzer with us coming up the next hour.
[00:08:37.067 --> 00:08:43.951]  Professor Jim Fetzer who has retired from the University up there in Minnesota just to focus full-time now on exposing 9-11.
[00:08:44.571 --> 00:08:45.792]  He's in the process of retiring.
[00:08:46.173 --> 00:08:51.116]  He was one of our most powerful speakers and he went on Hannity & Combs Thursday night.
[00:08:51.276 --> 00:08:53.417]  Ollie North was on the program.
[00:08:53.437 --> 00:08:55.218]  I know Jack Blood talked some about this Friday.
[00:08:55.238 --> 00:09:02.083]  We're going to be airing that again and letting Professor Fetzer comment on the hit piece and how he basically countered them.
[00:09:03.453 --> 00:09:05.195]  In a fashion that they were unaccustomed to.
[00:09:05.235 --> 00:09:12.043]  They're normally used to people just whimpering and begging and rolling over to their twisted propaganda on the Neocon News Channel.
[00:09:12.944 --> 00:09:13.825]  So that's all coming up.
[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:19.845]  You're going to get a chance to hear some of the comments and things that Charlie Sheen had to say.
[00:09:19.885 --> 00:09:22.547]  That's coming up in this hour as well.
[00:09:23.348 --> 00:09:25.490]  Charlie Sheen introducing myself there.
[00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:33.257]  And throughout the week, we're going to play large excerpts of some of the speeches from the 9-11 conference in Los Angeles over the weekend.
[00:09:33.277 --> 00:09:35.018]  I want to thank everybody that did come out to the event.
[00:09:35.358 --> 00:09:40.203]  It was historical, it was wonderful, and there was a lot of mainstream and alternative media there.
[00:09:40.743 --> 00:09:44.746]  I know there's a question that's on everyone's minds because we're getting hundreds of emails and dozens of calls about it.
[00:09:45.206 --> 00:09:53.791]  As we speak, when is C-SPAN going to air the roughly two hours that they taped of the panel discussion from Sunday morning?
[00:09:53.851 --> 00:09:55.132]  First I was told this Wednesday.
[00:09:55.492 --> 00:09:57.893]  Now they're saying this weekend because they want time to promote it.
[00:09:58.174 --> 00:09:59.675]  And then it will air three times.
[00:09:59.935 --> 00:10:02.096]  We do not have a show date yet for you.
[00:10:02.596 --> 00:10:06.599]  We're told it could be going up on the C-SPAN 1 website at any time.
[00:10:07.459 --> 00:10:08.560]  You can go there and look for 9-11.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:16.083]  Scholars Symposium, the Neocon Agenda, that's what they're going to be listing it as.
[00:10:16.663 --> 00:10:23.887]  So as soon as we find out, or as soon as you find out, give us a call and we will post it and let everyone know about it.
[00:10:23.907 --> 00:10:36.513]  It's important to promote this, so that when it does air, everyone can tune in and get just a small portion, a small bird's eye window tower view into what happened this weekend.
[00:10:36.573 --> 00:10:37.554]  It was wonderful.
[00:10:40.629 --> 00:10:45.593]  But right now, let's go ahead and air Professor Fetzer so we can comment and analyze it.
[00:10:46.874 --> 00:10:47.955]  Four minutes, ten seconds.
[00:10:48.716 --> 00:11:02.567]  Four minutes, ten seconds from Fox Television last week when he went on Hannity and Combs, but instead of Hannity being there, it was Combs and it was good old Ollie North.
[00:11:02.587 --> 00:11:02.988]  Here it is.
[00:11:04.552 --> 00:11:07.474]  ...on to the campuses of some major American universities.
[00:11:07.494 --> 00:11:14.701]  Joining us now, the co-chairman of Scholars for 9-11 Truth, Professor Emeritus at the University of Minnesota at Duluth, James Fetzer.
[00:11:14.781 --> 00:11:16.182]  Professor, thank you so much for being with us.
[00:11:16.462 --> 00:11:18.264]  First of all, is this a required course?
[00:11:18.284 --> 00:11:21.507]  Can you hear me?
[00:11:22.008 --> 00:11:22.568]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:11:22.608 --> 00:11:23.429]  Is it a required course?
[00:11:24.874 --> 00:11:27.656]  Well, you've got your facts foxed, I'm sorry to say.
[00:11:27.716 --> 00:11:42.043]  In fact, I created an organization of faculty and experts to study 9-11, not to teach in courses, but I must tell you what we have discovered would certainly qualify as material for an important course the university ought to be teaching.
[00:11:42.263 --> 00:11:43.123]  I want to be clear here.
[00:11:43.423 --> 00:11:44.644]  You're not teaching a course in this.
[00:11:45.004 --> 00:11:49.986]  No, you're confused, and I hope that Fox usually does a better job on their research than this.
[00:11:50.206 --> 00:12:00.431]  I did create, I created an organization of faculty and scholars to study 9-11, and we discovered that practically everything the government has told us about it is false.
[00:12:00.471 --> 00:12:02.212]  I want to get into that in a moment, I just want to be clear.
[00:12:02.292 --> 00:12:09.735]  So as far as you know, there is no course on 9-11 conspiracy theories being taught at your university or any place else that you know of?
[00:12:10.464 --> 00:12:11.986]  That's right, but it's a great idea.
[00:12:12.086 --> 00:12:16.090]  I would certainly support having such a course because there's a lot of material to work with.
[00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:25.399]  Alright, and what evidence do you have that the government was involved, that Cheney knew, that anybody in the chain of command knew ahead of time that this was going to happen on 9-11?
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:29.744]  Can you give us any piece of evidence that would substantiate that argument?
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:30.821]  Absolutely.
[00:12:30.861 --> 00:12:41.748]  For example, Norman Mineta testified to the 9-11 Commission that he observed Dick Cheney in an underground bunker when a young aide came up to him and repeatedly told him, Sir, it's 50 miles out.
[00:12:41.788 --> 00:12:42.568]  Sir, it's 30 miles out.
[00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:43.629]  Sir, it's 10 miles out.
[00:12:43.669 --> 00:12:44.950]  Sir, do the orders still stand?
[00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:49.253]  Cheney turned around, jumped on him nearly, bit off his head and said, of course the orders still stand.
[00:12:49.273 --> 00:12:50.234]  Have you heard anything different?
[00:12:50.574 --> 00:12:54.837]  The order had to be to not shoot down the plane that was approaching the Pentagon.
[00:12:55.397 --> 00:12:57.440]  After all, the order should have been to shoot it down.
[00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:10.315]  Shooting it down would be the obvious thing to do when you consider that you're going to lose the passengers in the plane if you shoot it down, but if you don't, you're going to use the passengers in the plane and also, of course, all the personnel and property at the target.
[00:13:11.355 --> 00:13:15.517]  Let me ask you, I want to go back to something in exchange that you and Alan just had a moment ago.
[00:13:15.557 --> 00:13:25.202]  In fairness to our producers, when they talked to you earlier, you said that courses are being taught in which these conspiracy theories are advanced to the students.
[00:13:25.262 --> 00:13:25.742]  Am I correct?
[00:13:26.448 --> 00:13:27.368]  No, you're not correct.
[00:13:27.428 --> 00:13:42.395]  What I said to him was, in courses on critical thinking, sometimes issues related to, for example, tax cuts, or global warming, or reasons for going to war in Iraq, might be discussed as examples, but I know of no courses as such that are being taught that way.
[00:13:42.415 --> 00:13:52.179]  So let me ask, how big is this group of professors that you've put together, this organization you've formed, that gives credence, if you will, to the theory you just advanced about 9-11?
[00:13:53.039 --> 00:14:05.924]  Well, there are over 300 members, Colonel North, including about 200 with advanced research skills, and about 85 that have affiliations, including physicists, mechanical engineers, pilots, aeronautical engineers.
[00:14:06.284 --> 00:14:09.625]  We've discovered that the Twin Towers were brought down by controlled demolition.
[00:14:10.045 --> 00:14:14.967]  We've discovered that the Osama bin Laden appears to have had nothing to do with it.
[00:14:15.027 --> 00:14:15.647]  Help me out here.
[00:14:16.547 --> 00:14:20.929]  Having been involved in a couple of controversial undertakings over my years in government service,
[00:14:21.681 --> 00:14:26.208]  How many people in the government were part of this conspiracy that you envisioned?
[00:14:26.798 --> 00:14:27.218]  Hundreds?
[00:14:27.298 --> 00:14:27.838]  Thousands?
[00:14:28.579 --> 00:14:29.319]  No, no, Ollie.
[00:14:29.399 --> 00:14:30.519]  I think it's a small number.
[00:14:30.559 --> 00:14:36.281]  You know about classified, controlled operations, where everything's departmentalized.
[00:14:36.481 --> 00:14:42.664]  Do you know, Ollie, that the FBI has confirmed that they have no hard evidence relating Osama bin Laden to the events of 9-11?
[00:14:42.684 --> 00:14:43.484]  Are you aware of that?
[00:14:43.644 --> 00:14:45.625]  Well, Osama bin Laden himself claims that.
[00:14:45.665 --> 00:14:47.505]  I mean, they didn't manufacture those tapes.
[00:14:47.525 --> 00:14:48.766]  This is the FBI, Ollie.
[00:14:48.846 --> 00:14:54.508]  This is the FBI that has affirmed in the last couple of weeks they have no hard evidence tying Osama bin Laden to 9-11.
[00:14:55.889 --> 00:15:02.553]  And so all of these people that died on 9-11, as you're articulating, died as a consequence of what our government did.
[00:15:02.893 --> 00:15:05.095]  We're trying to find out exactly what happened.
[00:15:05.195 --> 00:15:09.478]  Our government has a considerable reputation for telling things that are not true, Ollie.
[00:15:09.518 --> 00:15:10.379]  All right, Professor.
[00:15:10.419 --> 00:15:11.820]  Thank you very much for coming on tonight.
[00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.461]  Coming up, former Israeli Prime Minister
[00:15:14.725 --> 00:15:19.966]  So they cut him off because they were having a lot of trouble dissecting what he was saying and what he was doing.
[00:15:20.006 --> 00:15:22.607]  Those segments are normally about six and a half minutes long.
[00:15:22.627 --> 00:15:31.648]  They cut it off about two minutes shy of that, and Professor Fetzer will be joining us to talk about the conference and that confrontation on Fox News with Oliver North.
[00:15:31.988 --> 00:15:40.310]  You know, we always hear from people out there, especially in the establishment, that it's impossible to carry out an attack this big because the people would have learned of it if the government was involved.
[00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:58.264]  Number one, the Manhattan Project had over 10,000 people, really the number is around 12,000, intimately involved at Los Alamos and other secret laboratories in the American Southwest for three and a half years, conservatively.
[00:15:59.105 --> 00:16:07.772]  And no one found out about it until those two A-bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II.
[00:16:11.129 --> 00:16:13.611]  Now, that's the historical record.
[00:16:13.651 --> 00:16:14.672]  It cannot be debated.
[00:16:15.192 --> 00:16:17.334]  So, really, over 12,000 people.
[00:16:17.354 --> 00:16:21.277]  I always say 10,000, but I even looked at the number last week because I was going to talk about it in a speech.
[00:16:21.578 --> 00:16:25.020]  It was around 12,000 individuals involved.
[00:16:25.501 --> 00:16:28.683]  That is in the upper compartment, the top of the pyramidal power structure.
[00:16:28.964 --> 00:16:31.566]  There were hundreds of thousands involved in the enrichment.
[00:16:32.046 --> 00:16:45.269]  And creating the precursors and the machining and the preparation who had large portions of the project, but around 12,000 that were intimately involved.
[00:16:45.289 --> 00:16:54.211]  12,000 people for three plus years in total secrecy, no one knowing, until those bombs were dropped.
[00:16:55.211 --> 00:16:55.491]  Okay?
[00:16:56.354 --> 00:17:00.558]  And they have kept so many other huge projects and operations in secret.
[00:17:00.818 --> 00:17:02.019]  Here's an even better example.
[00:17:03.441 --> 00:17:03.861]  U.S.
[00:17:03.941 --> 00:17:13.530]  troops between 1,000 and in some cases 10,000 plus advisors at the beginning was around 1,000 starting in 1959 with Eisenhower were in French
[00:17:20.405 --> 00:17:24.349]  Southeast Asian, what you know today, what we know today, as Vietnam.
[00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:26.811]  They were in Southern Vietnam.
[00:17:27.852 --> 00:17:29.734]  They went in to back up the French and others.
[00:17:30.775 --> 00:17:41.425]  And it wasn't until 1964 that the war was officially announced and we had over 6,000 casualties from the troops.
[00:17:41.465 --> 00:17:42.606]  So they could keep upwards of 10,000
[00:17:44.457 --> 00:17:45.599]  Was really higher than that by 64.
[00:17:45.639 --> 00:17:46.861]  But they could keep 10,000 advisors there.
[00:17:46.881 --> 00:17:47.563]  6,000 plus could die.
[00:17:47.583 --> 00:17:48.404]  Could die.
[00:17:53.684 --> 00:18:01.746]  in five years from 59 to 64 really over five years and no one even knew about it here in the United States.
[00:18:01.866 --> 00:18:18.791]  Six thousand plus dead troops a huge military action and they were able to come and come talk to the families when they delivered the caskets tell them it was an accident, tell them it was a construction accident, tell them they crashed in a helicopter, tell them they crashed in a cargo plane.
[00:18:20.112 --> 00:18:20.892]  They were able to keep
[00:18:22.441 --> 00:18:26.102]  I think the number was like 6,400 and something that died as advisors in those five years.
[00:18:26.462 --> 00:18:34.724]  They were able to keep 6,000 plus dead people secret and keep a covert war secret for five years.
[00:18:37.025 --> 00:18:41.226]  Now that's on the record, completely declassified, public record, not debatable.
[00:18:41.366 --> 00:18:42.366]  So they kept that secret.
[00:18:42.406 --> 00:18:45.327]  So I don't want to hear that you couldn't keep 9-11 secret.
[00:18:45.367 --> 00:18:48.967]  By the way, now they tried for a few years, they have it now, it's come out.
[00:18:49.448 --> 00:18:51.128]  People have blown the whistle on the government.
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.001]  It is now part of the record.
[00:18:53.041 --> 00:18:54.042]  We have exposed it.
[00:18:54.082 --> 00:18:58.286]  So history shows you can keep it secret for a while, but you can't keep it secret forever.
[00:18:58.647 --> 00:19:00.568]  And yes, we're exposing it today.
[00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:06.134]  That is the bottom line on this subject.
[00:19:06.804 --> 00:19:08.785]  I want to shift gears out of 9-11 for a little while.
[00:19:08.805 --> 00:19:11.265]  I want to get into Bush ignores laws that he signs.
[00:19:11.705 --> 00:19:13.286]  Vexing Congress, AP headline.
[00:19:13.826 --> 00:19:16.187]  Actual headline is Bush ignores laws he inks.
[00:19:16.647 --> 00:19:17.447]  Vexing Congress.
[00:19:17.927 --> 00:19:20.468]  Transportation Chief Norman Mineta resigns.
[00:19:21.008 --> 00:19:25.669]  We'll get into Limbaugh detained at airport with Viagra and quote other prescription drugs.
[00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:31.471]  At the same time a squirreled Bush threat sparks California port scare to show the hysteria.
[00:19:31.851 --> 00:19:32.631]  This is out of Reuters.
[00:19:33.111 --> 00:19:35.792]  A Reuters article about our 9-11 meeting we had.
[00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:37.430]  And several others.
[00:19:37.971 --> 00:19:38.191]  U.S.
[00:19:38.231 --> 00:19:42.053]  court to rule on pivotal case on global warming, but they're really pushing that right now.
[00:19:43.614 --> 00:19:45.575]  So much more is coming up today.
[00:19:45.635 --> 00:19:46.635]  I'm honored to be your host.
[00:19:46.655 --> 00:19:47.796]  Very thankful to be here.

[00:22:50.506 --> 00:22:50.806]  Hi, Mary.
[00:22:50.826 --> 00:22:51.247]  Good morning, Tom.
[00:22:51.267 --> 00:22:52.248]  Oh, you don't look well.
[00:22:52.268 --> 00:22:54.190]  I took your advice with a spoonful of sugar.
[00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:56.092]  It didn't give me the energy you said it would.
[00:23:08.456 --> 00:23:10.017]  Spoonful of sugar, right?
[00:23:10.237 --> 00:23:11.619]  That's an embarrassing pastime.
[00:23:11.839 --> 00:23:13.040]  I'm a changed woman, Tom.
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:16.383]  I found the products at opcpure.com to be exceptional.

[00:24:07.978 --> 00:24:10.302]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:12.666 --> 00:24:16.251]  One more comment on Ollie North on that Fox News piece from Hannity & Combs.
[00:24:16.932 --> 00:24:18.655]  Notice he goes, these aren't made up.
[00:24:18.755 --> 00:24:21.279]  Tapes have been a lot and we have the tapes.
[00:24:21.319 --> 00:24:22.241]  They're not made up.
[00:24:23.402 --> 00:24:24.963]  And of course, he's a consummate liar.
[00:24:24.983 --> 00:24:25.923]  He knows they're made up.
[00:24:26.284 --> 00:24:29.605]  The Fat Bin Laden tape of four years ago has been certified to be a fake.
[00:24:29.625 --> 00:24:36.209]  Not only does the visual naked eye show you that it's a totally different person, they've had linguists listen to the accident.
[00:24:36.249 --> 00:24:39.470]  It's someone completely different, who was obviously raised in the West.
[00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:40.571]  This is major universities.
[00:24:41.051 --> 00:24:46.335]  And they took real Bin Laden tapes from years past and created a voice print key, which is 100%.
[00:24:46.416 --> 00:24:50.599]  You know, you can call your voicemail, a lot of phone companies, it's all voice print.
[00:24:50.619 --> 00:24:52.000]  Get into your business by voice print.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:56.964]  They can take the real Bin Laden, create a voice print key, take the other one, and it's a totally different person.
[00:24:56.984 --> 00:24:57.585]  It doesn't work.
[00:24:58.245 --> 00:25:05.871]  And then they also admit that most of these, if not all of these Bin Laden tapes we see on television are old, re-edited videos pre-911.
[00:25:07.671 --> 00:25:12.593]  I mean, it's just unbelievable how fraudulent all of this is.
[00:25:12.613 --> 00:25:16.975]  This is the same crowd that's been caught creating fake WMD documents.
[00:25:17.255 --> 00:25:20.777]  This is the crowd that's been caught lying and lying and lying and lying.
[00:25:20.897 --> 00:25:25.158]  Plus, last week, right when I left town, they announced they found WMDs again.
[00:25:25.178 --> 00:25:28.600]  I haven't counted up how many times it's been.
[00:25:29.375 --> 00:25:30.856]  It's gotta be more than 15 times.
[00:25:30.896 --> 00:25:32.237]  It's probably something like 20 times.
[00:25:32.437 --> 00:25:36.700]  I was trying to scan back over my memory when I got to LA late Wednesday night.
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.121]  I turned on CNN and Fox.
[00:25:38.181 --> 00:25:39.902]  It was, we found the WMDs!
[00:25:39.942 --> 00:25:40.522]  We found them!
[00:25:41.062 --> 00:25:46.085]  And they had White House officials on and others going, well, why hasn't the President come out and said this vindicates him?
[00:25:46.126 --> 00:25:49.968]  Well, the President says this isn't exactly the WMDs they meant.
[00:25:51.408 --> 00:26:17.355]  What they do is, what they've done from the invasion in 2003 now to 2006 is every few months they go to an admitted UN inspected site where Saddam did have a WMD program before the invasion that were all discovered during the UN takeover of late 1991-1992 where they went into hundreds of sites and destroyed them, buried them, blew them up.
[00:26:17.475 --> 00:26:18.076]  Remember?
[00:26:18.916 --> 00:26:19.416]  Remember?
[00:26:20.333 --> 00:26:25.439]  So most of the hoaxes we've seen every few months, every few months this happens, they go, we found WMDs.
[00:26:25.939 --> 00:26:37.172]  To the point of, if you talk to a neocon on the street, and I've had arguments on buses, on planes, on trains, I've had arguments at the grocery store, a neocon will walk up and go, we saw this in Crawford, it's in my new film Terror Storm.
[00:26:37.768 --> 00:26:40.870]  And they'll go, no, they found the WMDs, the media just won't report it.
[00:26:41.291 --> 00:26:44.273]  Well, wait a minute, the White House won't come out and say that's WMDs now.
[00:26:44.593 --> 00:26:46.234]  Because they can't, because it isn't.
[00:26:46.754 --> 00:27:01.144]  It's discovered, certified, destroyed sites with stuff like sarin, and really primitive World War I stuff like mustard gas, and they'll go show some destroyed factories and sites and say, oh look, we discovered it.
[00:27:01.605 --> 00:27:02.345]  It's a fraud.
[00:27:02.726 --> 00:27:06.028]  And then there's really manifest frauds, patented frauds,
[00:27:07.253 --> 00:27:12.176]  Where they'll go, oh look, we found two mobile weapons anthrax labs.
[00:27:12.296 --> 00:27:14.617]  Now, day one, the British troops found it.
[00:27:14.678 --> 00:27:15.618]  They knew it was British.
[00:27:15.678 --> 00:27:16.779]  It had British serial numbers.
[00:27:17.159 --> 00:27:22.342]  It was in the James Weapons Dictionary that the weapons inspectors carry.
[00:27:22.842 --> 00:27:25.424]  They knew that Saddam had bought over twenty of these.
[00:27:25.744 --> 00:27:36.711]  They were pumping up hydrogen balloons, unmanned video blimps, that they put up during the trench warfare of the Iran-Iraq war that went on for almost eight years.
[00:27:38.081 --> 00:27:47.429]  They knew at minute one, it's now been totally documented, within weeks of them announcing these mobile anthrax bans, that they were for pumping up balloons.
[00:27:48.069 --> 00:27:54.595]  That they were for inflating unmanned hydrogen balloons for tethered blimp surveillance.
[00:27:54.775 --> 00:27:58.418]  Our own government has these, they have them on the southwest border for quote drug interdiction.
[00:27:58.438 --> 00:28:00.139]  The British use these in the channel.
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:04.983]  They knew, and the British are the main manufacturers of these, and these were British manufactured.
[00:28:05.865 --> 00:28:18.195]  But still, Neocon websites, and they've got reports they've put out, and they sell books claiming, I've even bought books, you know, that we found the WMDs, here's the Smoking Gun Report, Smoking Gun Book, we've had these idiot guests on, and they know what they're doing.
[00:28:18.575 --> 00:28:22.759]  They go, oh see, we found the mobile weapons trucks, it's a hot air balloon blimp.
[00:28:23.779 --> 00:28:30.525]  To be technical, they're not hot air, they're, that would be the more primitive type, they are hydrogen blimps.
[00:28:33.024 --> 00:28:37.529]  Because you use the cheaper gas, hydrogen, because it's flammable.
[00:28:37.689 --> 00:28:38.750]  You can use that in warfare.
[00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:41.232]  Helium is very expensive, really only comes from the United States.
[00:28:41.753 --> 00:28:44.255]  So a lot of foreign countries use hydrogen still.
[00:28:44.616 --> 00:28:46.738]  Side issue, it doesn't really matter.
[00:28:46.778 --> 00:28:53.725]  The point is, they knew they were for surveillance blimps, and they lied and said that they were anthrax laboratories.
[00:28:54.585 --> 00:28:56.446]  I mean, this is how ridiculous it is.
[00:28:56.906 --> 00:29:03.868]  And I have to have arguments with these low-grade morons out here who like to be lied to, will grab onto any fraud and believe it.
[00:29:05.369 --> 00:29:08.450]  And it's the same thing with the new report of WMDs.
[00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:09.190]  And it's all the same.
[00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:09.850]  It's a psyops.
[00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:10.891]  They know they can't prove it.
[00:29:10.911 --> 00:29:12.731]  They know the administration can't be connected to it.
[00:29:13.071 --> 00:29:16.112]  So they have their surrogates in the media discover they found WMDs.
[00:29:16.473 --> 00:29:19.234]  The White House won't make a statement on it because they know it isn't true.
[00:29:20.114 --> 00:29:21.774]  And it's the same thing here again.
[00:29:22.675 --> 00:29:23.335]  Remember how they
[00:29:24.835 --> 00:29:26.296]  Said, oh we found a mass grave.
[00:29:26.316 --> 00:29:30.819]  We don't know why there are all these caskets in a warehouse full of skeletons and sand.
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:42.607]  And then it was admitted that it was a certified site from 92, a war dead exchange site from dead they've dug up in the desert from the Iran-Iraq war where they exchanged the dead with the Iranians.
[00:29:43.207 --> 00:29:47.170]  Didn't matter, they got them a week of, we found the grizzly mass grave in a warehouse.
[00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:48.110]  See?
[00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:49.071]  See how this works?
[00:29:51.787 --> 00:29:54.771]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.712 --> 00:29:58.395]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:01.744 --> 00:31:03.345]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:31:03.505 --> 00:31:07.628]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:31:07.748 --> 00:31:10.609]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:31:10.689 --> 00:31:17.414]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:31:17.594 --> 00:31:20.595]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:31:20.816 --> 00:31:23.197]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:31:23.337 --> 00:31:28.040]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:37.545]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur.
[00:31:37.685 --> 00:31:42.788]  Even Nitrates and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum aren't extracted.
[00:31:42.949 --> 00:31:49.592]  Supercharge your Gravity Filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at
[00:31:54.495 --> 00:32:05.123]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[00:32:05.343 --> 00:32:06.204]  Look no further!
[00:32:06.504 --> 00:32:09.066]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[00:32:09.506 --> 00:32:18.033]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[00:32:18.173 --> 00:32:19.874]  You can order everything you need on the web
[00:32:19.974 --> 00:32:20.535]  I think so.
[00:32:35.677 --> 00:32:36.197]  We're good to go.
[00:33:10.422 --> 00:33:22.433]  Alright callers, your calls are coming up, but first I want to air the introduction Charlie Sheen gave me at the event Saturday, American Scholar Symposium 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda.
[00:33:22.513 --> 00:33:29.439]  Professor Fetzer joins us at the start of the next hour and then in the third hour, just for a quick update, her case got thrown out of court.
[00:33:30.405 --> 00:33:47.658]  The medical doctor, the Chinese-American, who Bush had arrested and they were going to charge her under terrorism charges for simply confronting President Bush and the President of China on organ harvesting of political dissidents in China.
[00:33:47.998 --> 00:33:49.279]  So good news on that front.
[00:33:49.619 --> 00:33:50.440]  That is coming up.
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:53.022]  But before we air this little seven minute clip of Charlie Sheen,
[00:33:54.309 --> 00:33:56.271]  I wanted to go to Debbie Morrow of New Millennium Concepts.
[00:33:56.291 --> 00:33:58.112]  Listen, hurricane season's here.
[00:33:58.553 --> 00:34:00.094]  There's all sorts of problems.
[00:34:00.114 --> 00:34:01.856]  There's all sorts of serious things going on.
[00:34:02.276 --> 00:34:06.560]  You need the high-quality, gravity-fed, made-in-America, big Berkeys.
[00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:08.682]  They also have the British Berkeys, if you prefer those.
[00:34:09.726 --> 00:34:13.070]  And they support this broadcast, and you also get them at wholesale prices.
[00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:19.135]  One of these standard filters will cost you $300 at a camp and supply store, and guaranteed they bought it from these guys.
[00:34:19.155 --> 00:34:24.060]  They're the manufacturer of the American-Made, and they're the main national distributor of the British Berkey.
[00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:32.488]  So, you save over $100, it's made in America, they support this type of broadcast, but on top of all of that, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:34:33.671 --> 00:34:34.872]  The crisis is now.
[00:34:34.992 --> 00:34:36.012]  It isn't over the hill.
[00:34:36.512 --> 00:34:39.313]  The water is full of every type of toxin you can imagine.
[00:34:39.353 --> 00:34:39.993]  That's admitted.
[00:34:40.053 --> 00:34:42.134]  Herbicides, pesticides, dead bacteria.
[00:34:42.574 --> 00:34:44.135]  Even if the chlorine does its job.
[00:34:44.655 --> 00:34:46.316]  The sodium, stannous, fluoride.
[00:34:46.816 --> 00:34:47.676]  Again, there's different types.
[00:34:47.696 --> 00:34:48.837]  There's the sodium, the stannous.
[00:34:49.077 --> 00:34:51.137]  They're all mixed together in a poison cocktail.
[00:34:51.718 --> 00:34:56.679]  The type of fluoride they use is admittedly just a toxic waste filled with other toxins.
[00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:57.900]  That's on the record.
[00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:00.801]  They have a special filter that goes on the Berkey filters that takes that out.
[00:35:01.321 --> 00:35:02.602]  There's really no other filters that do that.
[00:35:02.642 --> 00:35:04.423]  It's so hard to take the fluoride out.
[00:35:04.784 --> 00:35:05.884]  They have that available.
[00:35:06.185 --> 00:35:09.007]  And they have little sports bottles that are free gifts when you order a big filter.
[00:35:09.367 --> 00:35:11.588]  They do 630 refills of tap water.
[00:35:11.969 --> 00:35:13.350]  130 something of swamp water.
[00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:16.092]  And they just reduce it to safe levels.
[00:35:16.592 --> 00:35:19.374]  So when you're at the store or at the gym or wherever, you can use this.
[00:35:19.394 --> 00:35:20.835]  It's great for your children at school.
[00:35:21.415 --> 00:35:24.858]  Folks, it's the perfect place to put poison is in the water.
[00:35:25.178 --> 00:35:26.759]  And they're doing it by design.
[00:35:26.819 --> 00:35:27.900]  We have the documents.
[00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:33.083]  Now is the time to call and take advantage of the specials they're offering right now.
[00:35:33.383 --> 00:35:34.583]  Debbie, good to have you on with us.
[00:35:34.603 --> 00:35:37.285]  Hi Alex, thank you very much for having me.
[00:35:37.305 --> 00:35:40.707]  I heard you had a real successful time in California.
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:44.864]  I'd be on cloud nine right now if I hadn't woken up with a horrible backache this morning.
[00:35:46.345 --> 00:35:47.346]  That's from traveling.
[00:35:47.367 --> 00:35:48.147]  I know.
[00:35:48.187 --> 00:35:52.852]  Well, any time I don't sleep enough and I stress myself out for three or four days in a row, that's how my body responds.
[00:35:52.872 --> 00:35:55.615]  It doesn't happen very often, but boy, I could barely get out of bed this morning.
[00:35:56.016 --> 00:35:57.117]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:35:57.137 --> 00:35:58.559]  You need to hydrate yourself.
[00:35:58.579 --> 00:36:00.921]  You know, that's the thing about murky water.
[00:36:00.941 --> 00:36:03.304]  Drink lots of water and it hydrates all those
[00:36:04.099 --> 00:36:06.960]  Discs in between the bones and floats them better.
[00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:08.941]  So drink lots of Berkey water.
[00:36:09.221 --> 00:36:09.862]  Absolutely.
[00:36:09.922 --> 00:36:11.543]  Debbie, tell us about a couple of the specials.
[00:36:11.583 --> 00:36:14.244]  Tell us why the Berkey Made in America is the best.
[00:36:14.984 --> 00:36:30.812]  Well, the reason that the Berkey water filter purification elements with the black filters are the best is because they actually take out the pathogens to a non-detectable level and they don't require any electricity or water pressure.
[00:36:31.759 --> 00:36:38.204]  And you can take them anywhere, and you can use them all the time, not just in cases of emergency.
[00:36:38.604 --> 00:36:50.772]  So it is a filter system that you can have for everyday use, and then God forbid there is an emergency, you do have that opportunity to use it then too.
[00:36:51.373 --> 00:37:00.099]  And the specials that we're having right now, we have an Alex Jones special, where if you get the Berkey Light with the lights, or if you get one of our Royal Berkeys, Imperial
[00:37:00.615 --> 00:37:01.576]  We're good to go.
[00:37:21.394 --> 00:37:25.036]  Make that offer available to the Alex Jones listeners.
[00:37:25.556 --> 00:37:29.158]  Judy and I are here to answer any questions that y'all have.
[00:37:29.198 --> 00:37:41.825]  And you have the solar panels that charge radios, cell phones, and that hook into the base of the Berkey system with the lights that has the lights and all the systems in it, the LEDs that burn for hundreds of years.
[00:37:41.865 --> 00:37:42.205]  Absolutely.
[00:37:44.153 --> 00:37:48.075]  And those solar panels are real handy and have lots of different attachments.
[00:37:48.196 --> 00:37:49.316]  All right, Debbie, I'm going to give the number.
[00:37:49.356 --> 00:37:50.317]  I don't want people to call.
[00:37:50.377 --> 00:37:51.618]  Tell them it's an Alex Jones special.
[00:37:51.658 --> 00:37:52.438]  Take advantage of this.
[00:37:52.458 --> 00:37:53.199]  1-888-803-4438-8888.
[00:37:53.219 --> 00:37:55.620]  803-4438.
[00:37:59.642 --> 00:38:00.763]  If you call, the number's busy.
[00:38:01.063 --> 00:38:01.704]  Call right back.
[00:38:01.744 --> 00:38:03.185]  Or if it goes to voicemail, leave your name and number.
[00:38:03.225 --> 00:38:05.326]  Debbie or her assistants will call you right back.
[00:38:05.346 --> 00:38:05.426]  1-888-803-4438-8888.
[00:38:07.767 --> 00:38:08.308]  803-4438.
[00:38:09.429 --> 00:38:10.649]  Don't wait, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:17.514]  And at the same time, you can go to Berkeywater.com and order off the Secure Shopping Cart and tell them what free gift you want in the comments section.

[00:38:22.598 --> 00:38:23.739]  We have a big fat banner.

[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:36.101]  Debbie, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:38:36.181 --> 00:38:37.642]  Thank you for having me, Alex.
[00:38:37.822 --> 00:38:38.302]  God bless.
[00:38:38.422 --> 00:38:38.843]  Take care.
[00:38:38.863 --> 00:38:41.345]  Alright, I'm going to go to your calls.
[00:38:41.625 --> 00:38:43.006]  I'm going to go to your calls.
[00:38:43.587 --> 00:38:47.870]  If you missed that number, it's 888-803-4438 or Berkeywater.com.
[00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:52.774]  I'm going to go to your calls, but without further ado, Charlie Sheen has so much courage.
[00:38:54.321 --> 00:38:56.362]  I had the idea to have this conference.
[00:38:56.382 --> 00:39:02.864]  We were talking on the phone when he was getting ready to come on my radio show a few months ago, now almost three months ago.
[00:39:02.884 --> 00:39:05.965]  He said, you know Alex, we ought to have a film festival here in LA.
[00:39:06.025 --> 00:39:14.729]  I could invite some of my actor friends and director friends and producer friends and writer friends and boy were they at the meeting.
[00:39:15.209 --> 00:39:17.810]  A lot of people just think stars are what's important in Hollywood.
[00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:23.972]  A lot of people didn't notice who was in the crowd and I had some great meetings with some really prominent people.
[00:39:26.385 --> 00:39:27.325]  Well, I'm not going to get into it.
[00:39:27.506 --> 00:39:29.727]  They didn't say don't talk about them, but I'm just not going to.
[00:39:29.747 --> 00:39:34.169]  One of them has produced some of the biggest movies out there, written some of the biggest films out there.
[00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:37.371]  Some of the films that have got little anti-New World Order messages.
[00:39:37.411 --> 00:39:39.032]  I always wondered why we saw that in them.
[00:39:40.285 --> 00:39:41.605]  Okay, I'm not going to say the name.
[00:39:41.645 --> 00:39:43.706]  But the point is, fully aware of the New World Order.
[00:39:43.766 --> 00:39:45.267]  One of them is making a film that's coming out.
[00:39:45.287 --> 00:39:46.587]  It's going to be a big blockbuster.
[00:39:46.627 --> 00:39:52.269]  I mean, it's an $80-100 million movie to make, they were telling me, about government-sponsored terror.
[00:39:52.289 --> 00:39:53.089]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:39:53.189 --> 00:39:54.229]  Once it's out, I'll talk about it.
[00:39:54.249 --> 00:39:55.330]  It's about a year out.
[00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:56.210]  They're shooting it right now.
[00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:58.511]  And it was just great.
[00:39:58.671 --> 00:39:59.851]  And so Charlie had this idea.
[00:40:01.118 --> 00:40:02.219]  And he was going to emcee it.
[00:40:02.779 --> 00:40:05.701]  And I was just going to help organize it and be part of it.
[00:40:05.761 --> 00:40:07.743]  And then all of this garbage happened.
[00:40:07.883 --> 00:40:10.985]  He was told at many levels to shut up about 9-11 or else.
[00:40:11.225 --> 00:40:12.326]  And then they warned him again.
[00:40:12.706 --> 00:40:13.727]  He went on Jimmy Kimmel.
[00:40:13.807 --> 00:40:17.709]  And then, boy, they unleashed the firestorm through some of their surrogates.
[00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:19.351]  Total dirty tricks, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:20.171 --> 00:40:21.252]  And he was point blank told.
[00:40:21.292 --> 00:40:22.813]  But he was still there with the courage.
[00:40:23.233 --> 00:40:24.074]  Still went on stage.
[00:40:24.114 --> 00:40:24.814]  Still introduced me.
[00:40:24.834 --> 00:40:25.595]  Was still part of it.
[00:40:28.424 --> 00:40:30.106]  Now Lord knows what's going to happen to him next.
[00:40:30.146 --> 00:40:31.007]  I'm sure it'll be horrible.
[00:40:31.067 --> 00:40:32.749]  We had little discussions about that.
[00:40:32.849 --> 00:40:35.872]  He said, well, I'm probably sunk now, but it's the right thing to do.
[00:40:38.755 --> 00:40:42.739]  It's just so amazing to see this type of courage.
[00:40:43.379 --> 00:40:45.261]  Here it is, Charlie Sheen introducing myself.
[00:40:46.282 --> 00:40:49.546]  Presenting our next speaker is a man who needs no introduction.
[00:40:50.715 --> 00:40:57.698]  His recent courageous radio and television interviews have sparked a worldwide momentum in favor of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[00:40:59.359 --> 00:41:04.862]  He is the star of over 100 major motion pictures, including Wall Street, Red Dawn, and Platoon.
[00:41:05.402 --> 00:41:08.724]  Currently, you can see him on CBS' Two and a Half Men.
[00:41:09.804 --> 00:41:12.826]  Ladies and gentlemen, the indestructible Charlie Sheen!
[00:41:32.824 --> 00:41:33.044]  Thank you.
[00:41:33.064 --> 00:41:37.667]  Thank you all.
[00:41:40.209 --> 00:41:41.090]  That is so moving.
[00:41:41.410 --> 00:41:41.790]  Thank you.
[00:41:42.171 --> 00:41:43.091]  Thank you all for coming.
[00:41:43.231 --> 00:41:43.972]  Good evening.
[00:41:46.274 --> 00:41:55.240]  Everybody's making a big deal about what I did.
[00:41:56.761 --> 00:41:58.782]  I just felt like I was pursuing the truth.
[00:41:59.843 --> 00:42:00.344]  That's all.
[00:42:06.975 --> 00:42:11.440]  But I want to talk about what we're doing today, more specifically.
[00:42:14.064 --> 00:42:18.088]  We are here today to effect a change.
[00:42:20.951 --> 00:42:26.178]  We are here today to ask those still sleeping to wake up and join us.
[00:42:34.594 --> 00:42:41.918]  We are here today to present a case forged in science at the bedrock and common sense in its foundation.
[00:42:43.659 --> 00:42:54.626]  We are here today to fire a warning shot across the bow of mainstream media to remind them of their original responsibility as civil and political watchdogs.
[00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:07.692]  We are here today because fear is never a good enough reason to do nothing.
[00:43:12.094 --> 00:43:17.157]  We are here today to fuel the deconstruction of the official myth.
[00:43:21.699 --> 00:43:29.022]  We are here today to hold our course, to bang our drums, to sharpen our focus,
[00:43:31.121 --> 00:43:31.701]  Yeah!
[00:43:32.481 --> 00:43:36.642]  We're also here today to exercise our right to assemble.
[00:43:45.424 --> 00:43:46.804]  Our right to speak freely.
[00:43:51.745 --> 00:43:52.785]  And our right to choose.
[00:43:56.661 --> 00:44:04.064]  We are here today to begin draining the cesspool of lies and distortion we refuse to drown in any longer.
[00:44:04.084 --> 00:44:16.109]  We are here today to unleash a juggernaut of truth.
[00:44:22.972 --> 00:44:24.073]  We are also here today
[00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:29.652]  To honor the victims and the families of 9-11.
[00:44:37.879 --> 00:44:39.500]  We're here today for our children.
[00:44:46.546 --> 00:44:47.467]  As well as their children.
[00:44:53.349 --> 00:45:02.713]  In our country's great history, every seminal movement, every groundbreaking event, every pioneering moment began with one person.
[00:45:04.873 --> 00:45:05.774]  A person with a vision.
[00:45:06.834 --> 00:45:08.555]  A person with an undying passion.
[00:45:09.075 --> 00:45:12.556]  A person who could not and would not do nothing.
[00:45:13.697 --> 00:45:21.920]  A person who risked everything to stand naked in the eye of the storm, in the mouth of the beast, in the crosshairs of oppression.
[00:45:23.647 --> 00:45:27.510]  We are blessed to have such a person with us today.
[00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:34.356]  A true patriot, a real American, a genuine hero.
[00:45:36.597 --> 00:45:40.440]  It is with great honor that I introduce our next speaker.
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:48.607]  Please join me in welcoming my friend, my comrade, my brother-in-arms, ladies and gentlemen of Money Only, Alex Jones!
[00:46:05.129 --> 00:46:06.550]  I want to thank all of you for being here.
[00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:08.871]  I'm sorry to keep everybody trying.
[00:46:08.931 --> 00:46:14.154]  I'm not going to keep you up here too long, but what's it like to see all these energized people?
[00:46:14.174 --> 00:46:19.797]  I mean, this was your idea, really, originally, to have a Truth Convergence here in Los Angeles.
[00:46:19.817 --> 00:46:22.459]  What do you think of this?
[00:46:22.619 --> 00:46:25.020]  This is real, and this is inspiring.
[00:46:29.667 --> 00:46:31.149]  Charlie, what was it like when you took that plunge?
[00:46:31.169 --> 00:46:31.950]  Because we talked about it.
[00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:33.011]  I mean, Charlie knew what he was doing.
[00:46:33.512 --> 00:46:35.113]  You know, some of his people got it smart.
[00:46:35.414 --> 00:46:39.899]  What was it like when you took that plunge and you decided to go public and speak out?
[00:46:40.099 --> 00:46:45.466]  When everybody else, you know, in the Holocaust, they didn't have the will that you had, the courage.
[00:46:45.506 --> 00:46:46.066]  How did you do that?
[00:46:48.759 --> 00:47:02.743]  I just got tired of listening to the lies, and knew it was time to do something, but specifically that plunge was like, I guess jumping out of an airplane, not knowing if I had a parachute.
[00:47:03.564 --> 00:47:09.565]  Well, Charlie Sheen, I want to thank you for being here, I want to thank the crowd for being here, and I'm just honored to have you here with us.
[00:47:09.585 --> 00:47:11.586]  There's no way to top what you said, it was like Shakespeare.
[00:47:12.506 --> 00:47:15.627]  No, it wasn't, come on.
[00:47:16.528 --> 00:47:18.128]  Charlie, thank you so much for being here.
[00:47:34.656 --> 00:47:36.037]  Well, that's history right there.
[00:47:36.978 --> 00:47:37.818]  That is history.
[00:47:38.258 --> 00:47:44.362]  And he knew exactly what he was doing when he went on my radio show twice, when he went on Jimmy Kimmel, when he'd been told to shut up.
[00:47:45.043 --> 00:47:48.785]  He knew exactly what he was doing Saturday and Sunday when he was there, when he spoke out.
[00:47:50.306 --> 00:47:52.148]  And we'll get a story out on his comments now.
[00:47:52.188 --> 00:47:53.288]  I know Paul Watson's listening.
[00:47:53.308 --> 00:47:58.372]  We'll get the transcript of what Mr. Sheen had to say and get that video posted for you.
[00:47:58.412 --> 00:47:59.673]  It's up on YouTube right now.
[00:47:59.693 --> 00:48:04.416]  I hope all of you will go to Infowars.com and spread it to the four winds immediately.
[00:48:05.652 --> 00:48:08.174]  Let's go ahead and start going to some of your calls, my friends.
[00:48:08.194 --> 00:48:18.260]  Throughout the week we'll have more of the speeches and more of the comments and more of the questions from the listeners from the attendees for you here on the Alex Jones Show on the one, the only GCN Radio Network.
[00:48:19.001 --> 00:48:20.722]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Texas.
[00:48:20.782 --> 00:48:21.362]  Mike, go ahead.
[00:48:22.223 --> 00:48:32.269]  Hey Alex, the big mystery I always had, I wasn't sure what, you know, Limbaugh with his EIB network, and it's pretty obvious now that's short for
[00:48:32.836 --> 00:48:33.036]  I think?
[00:48:52.512 --> 00:49:02.598]  website that will find a press release dated November 7, 2001, where they had a press conference outlining specifically this program and how Bush was going to implement it.
[00:49:02.618 --> 00:49:03.698]  I think that's very interesting.
[00:49:03.718 --> 00:49:07.120]  For those that don't know about him calling the New York Times traitors, which is totally staged.
[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:08.321]  They're New World Order all the way.
[00:49:08.561 --> 00:49:13.604]  New York Times reporters were working for the government, lying about yellow cake uranium and aluminum tubes.
[00:49:13.644 --> 00:49:14.564]  That's on record.
[00:49:14.944 --> 00:49:18.246]  But for those that don't know the back story on what you're talking about, tell them.
[00:49:19.067 --> 00:49:20.988]  Well, I watched it last night and they
[00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:35.109]  They decided to go ahead and run this article and obviously they got information leaked to them from somewhere inside the government and I saw this lady on Chris Matthews was going nuts with Al Sharpton.
[00:49:35.129 --> 00:49:39.272]  She was a version of Coulter and they're talking, they're trying to prosecute.
[00:49:39.292 --> 00:49:41.433]  They want these jail times for these guys.
[00:49:41.513 --> 00:49:45.036]  It's just disgusting and Joe Scarborough, a Republican,
[00:49:45.786 --> 00:49:52.272]  Last night I saw him, and God bless him, he said, this is bull****, excuse my French, but he said... Alright, listen, I appreciate your call, sir, take care.
[00:49:54.474 --> 00:50:00.320]  If they are allowed to set the precedent to start prosecuting reporters,
[00:50:01.303 --> 00:50:03.024]  For getting classified material.
[00:50:03.145 --> 00:50:13.292]  Remember a month ago, the Supreme Court ruled that a state prosecutor in Southern California who found out police were framing people and lying on the stand, he said, I can't be part of this.
[00:50:13.312 --> 00:50:14.153]  This is the prosecutor.
[00:50:14.173 --> 00:50:15.334]  He said, we cannot do this.
[00:50:16.295 --> 00:50:19.457]  And he got demoted, and now I'm told fired, and he sued over it.
[00:50:20.198 --> 00:50:22.460]  And the Supreme Court said, yeah, you're not protected.
[00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:24.281]  You can't report on corruption.
[00:50:25.902 --> 00:50:29.205]  And there have been other cases where courts have said, well, your boss was
[00:50:30.334 --> 00:50:33.196]  You know, caught having sex with the secretary on the desk.
[00:50:33.216 --> 00:50:34.918]  I mean, these are real cases.
[00:50:35.758 --> 00:50:39.981]  And, uh, you reported it and got fired and you're not allowed to, and this is in government.
[00:50:41.042 --> 00:50:43.244]  I mean, it's things like this, or your boss got caught...
[00:50:44.016 --> 00:50:47.879]  You know, ordering employees to write checks to him, claiming they were for expenses.
[00:50:47.899 --> 00:50:49.601]  That's another case in the government.
[00:50:49.901 --> 00:50:51.942]  And then you get fired if you report on that.
[00:50:51.983 --> 00:50:55.565]  I mean, they're doing, you know, let's arrest reporters for reporting on corruption.
[00:50:56.486 --> 00:51:00.129]  Let's arrest... This is the criminals trying to suppress what's happening.
[00:51:01.590 --> 00:51:05.954]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.094 --> 00:51:10.457]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:13.633 --> 00:51:15.134]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.949 --> 00:51:42.337]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.557 --> 00:51:47.901]  If you want to understand what the new old order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:52:01.377 --> 00:52:06.602]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:52:06.742 --> 00:52:14.851]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:52:15.091 --> 00:52:22.158]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:52:22.338 --> 00:52:23.598]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[00:52:23.678 --> 00:52:29.580]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:34.861]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:52:34.961 --> 00:52:43.844]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:52:44.104 --> 00:52:50.986]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at

[00:53:47.248 --> 00:53:50.349]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:50.509 --> 00:53:56.491]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:04.213 --> 00:54:10.235]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:10.835 --> 00:54:13.776]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:15.534 --> 00:54:19.375]  Alright, Jason in New York was up next, he just hung up, so we'll go to Jason in Maryland, John, Jim and others.
[00:54:19.395 --> 00:54:34.598]  Before I do that, just briefly, now for four or five days we've had Terror Storm up on PrisonPlanet.tv for members in high bandwidth and low bandwidth in two different or three different types of platforms for you.
[00:54:34.979 --> 00:54:36.779]  My new film Terror Storm, it is
[00:54:38.892 --> 00:54:40.533]  99% the official version that will be coming out.
[00:54:40.593 --> 00:54:47.777]  As soon as the film is completely done and a little bit tightened up and remixed, we'll be putting it up in the next week or so on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:54:47.797 --> 00:54:50.379]  The totally final official version.
[00:54:51.079 --> 00:54:53.341]  Then in the next month I'll have the extras done.
[00:54:54.922 --> 00:54:58.644]  The extra little Easter eggs as they call them that will go on the DVD.
[00:54:58.664 --> 00:55:05.008]  We'll probably have about 30-45 minutes of extra footage and information on the official DVD that comes out in about a month.
[00:55:05.997 --> 00:55:08.058]  Until then, though, it's too important to wait.
[00:55:08.758 --> 00:55:12.520]  I am putting out the American Scholar Symposium version.
[00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:14.521]  I only made about 1,100 copies of this.
[00:55:14.921 --> 00:55:16.202]  We took 1,000 to the event.
[00:55:17.062 --> 00:55:18.363]  We only sold about half of them.
[00:55:18.763 --> 00:55:21.865]  And so there's about 400, 500 of these.
[00:55:22.345 --> 00:55:23.285]  We haven't counted them.
[00:55:23.486 --> 00:55:24.966]  It looks like 500, 400 and something.
[00:55:25.527 --> 00:55:27.908]  We're going to sell these and then that's it in the next month.
[00:55:27.948 --> 00:55:30.289]  It's going up on the website right now.
[00:55:31.189 --> 00:55:44.172]  It doesn't have extras on it, but you'll have it first, and it's really a little special edition because it'll be a little bit different than the edition you finally get on the official DVD, and even the menu says American Scholars Symposium.
[00:55:44.492 --> 00:55:51.114]  So it's a collector's item, and yes, I will sign every single copy that goes out of this.
[00:55:51.214 --> 00:55:55.035]  I will sign the jacket of every single copy, the copies we've got.
[00:55:55.075 --> 00:55:56.775]  And when they're gone, they're gone.
[00:55:56.815 --> 00:55:58.296]  So go to InfoWars.com.
[00:55:58.316 --> 00:55:59.336]  I think it's up there right now.
[00:56:00.649 --> 00:56:02.811]  Order it, or you can call the toll-free number 1-888-253-3139.
[00:56:02.991 --> 00:56:09.457]  It's Terror Storm, the American Scholar Symposium Special Edition version.
[00:56:10.498 --> 00:56:11.139]  We cannot wait.
[00:56:11.159 --> 00:56:12.720]  We've got to get this out now.
[00:56:12.841 --> 00:56:17.485]  It's there for PrisonPlanet.tv members right now, and they'll get the other two versions that are coming out.
[00:56:18.206 --> 00:56:19.287]  We have to rush this out.
[00:56:19.327 --> 00:56:20.147]  We cannot wait.
[00:56:20.368 --> 00:56:22.089]  The globalists could carry out terror at any moment.
[00:56:22.109 --> 00:56:23.791]  We've got to get this out there in the people's hands.
[00:56:24.806 --> 00:56:28.429]  So InfoWars.com, get your copy right now of Terror Storm.
[00:56:28.469 --> 00:56:29.130]  It is available.

[00:56:45.103 --> 00:56:46.124]  Let's go ahead and talk to
[00:56:47.253 --> 00:56:48.234]  Jason in Maryland.
[00:56:48.254 --> 00:56:49.154]  Jason, you're on the air.
[00:56:49.734 --> 00:56:50.435]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:56:50.655 --> 00:56:53.216]  I want to take a second and thank you.
[00:56:53.657 --> 00:56:56.418]  I know you don't like to hear it, but I think you're humble.
[00:56:57.399 --> 00:56:59.820]  Thank you very much for being a patriot and standing for the truth.
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:01.401]  We know that they killed William Cooper.
[00:57:02.221 --> 00:57:05.983]  They've killed many men who have taken a stand for the truth, and I appreciate it.
[00:57:06.023 --> 00:57:11.106]  Thank you, Charlie Sheen, for putting your career on the line and your life on the line.
[00:57:11.646 --> 00:57:12.487]  It took a lot of guts.
[00:57:12.567 --> 00:57:13.407]  Thank you very much, sir.
[00:57:15.447 --> 00:57:21.271]  Wow, three or four years ago I called you and asked you why you weren't dead, if these things were true.
[00:57:21.351 --> 00:57:29.836]  Since then I've been studying very hard and I know that everything you've said is true, that you validate and verify everything, every fact that you put out.
[00:57:30.477 --> 00:57:42.104]  And now I wonder more why you're not insane from fighting your way up this slippery slope when there's so much disinformation out there.
[00:57:42.811 --> 00:57:49.053]  When Oliver North, a traitor to the country, can be called a great Christian on TBN, we live in a twilight zone.
[00:57:49.173 --> 00:57:51.133]  And just thank you, Alex, for what you're doing.
[00:57:51.513 --> 00:57:52.193]  Oh, I appreciate it.
[00:57:52.353 --> 00:57:53.934]  I appreciate that, Jason.
[00:57:54.334 --> 00:57:55.094]  Let me comment on that.
[00:57:55.514 --> 00:57:57.775]  I'm alive, number one, because God wants me to be alive.
[00:57:58.655 --> 00:57:59.015]  Okay?
[00:57:59.515 --> 00:58:01.636]  Number two, if they kill me, I'll become a martyr.
[00:58:01.676 --> 00:58:05.817]  Because the people who get killed are the ones that sequestered themselves, that are working on something big.
[00:58:06.157 --> 00:58:07.877]  The government learns of it, they come and kill them.
[00:58:08.137 --> 00:58:09.038]  I've done a lot of work.
[00:58:09.078 --> 00:58:10.198]  I've put my work out there.
[00:58:11.050 --> 00:58:13.171]  I'm just one more person in the fight.
[00:58:13.811 --> 00:58:18.253]  Frankly, I've never tried to make myself the big leader, because that really does make it dangerous.
[00:58:18.913 --> 00:58:21.374]  But as things develop, that's the position I go into.
[00:58:22.035 --> 00:58:24.816]  And, you know, don't be surprised if the enemy strikes me down.
[00:58:25.336 --> 00:58:26.517]  But life's short, folks.
[00:58:26.557 --> 00:58:27.257]  I'm living at 110%.
[00:58:27.837 --> 00:58:28.858]  I couldn't be more alive.
[00:58:29.218 --> 00:58:30.098]  And it doesn't matter.
[00:58:30.138 --> 00:58:30.978]  I've counted the cost.
[00:58:31.379 --> 00:58:32.139]  I know what I've got to do.
[00:58:32.339 --> 00:58:34.260]  There's a better chance they'll set me up with something.
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:35.660]  That's what they do to people they don't want to kill.
[00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:36.941]  They try to destroy you.
[00:58:37.401 --> 00:58:39.062]  And if I've destroyed, c'est la vie.
[00:58:41.337 --> 00:58:46.182]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:46.202 --> 00:58:46.662]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.822 --> 00:58:47.623]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.823 --> 00:58:50.266]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:50.326 --> 00:58:52.147]  You want answers?
[00:58:53.388 --> 00:58:55.370]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.076 --> 00:59:09.865]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.266 --> 00:59:14.336]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:17.801]  I am committed.
[00:59:18.001 --> 00:59:20.864]  I passed the point of no return a long time ago.
[00:59:20.924 --> 00:59:23.127]  I've already jumped out of the airplane.
[00:59:23.187 --> 00:59:26.070]  I hope my parachute opens, but if it doesn't, it doesn't matter.
[00:59:26.090 --> 00:59:27.151]  I don't have a choice now.
[00:59:27.171 --> 00:59:29.714]  I'm in the fight against the New World Order.
[00:59:29.734 --> 00:59:30.835]  They're criminally insane.
[00:59:30.855 --> 00:59:31.736]  They're out of control.
[00:59:31.776 --> 00:59:32.277]  They're wicked.
[00:59:32.697 --> 00:59:33.999]  They must be resisted.
[00:59:34.039 --> 00:59:34.799]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:59:34.819 --> 00:59:37.282]  We've been covering and playing some clips of the incredible 9-11
[00:59:38.303 --> 00:59:38.443]  Hello?
[01:00:05.191 --> 01:00:06.032]  San Diego, excuse me.
[01:00:06.052 --> 01:00:06.612]  San Diego.
[01:00:06.672 --> 01:00:08.533]  I just see SD and forgot.
[01:00:08.733 --> 01:00:09.694]  Go ahead.
[01:00:10.094 --> 01:00:12.615]  Alex, I was at the conference over the weekend.
[01:00:12.695 --> 01:00:15.877]  I brought my wife and a friend in Los Angeles.
[01:00:16.898 --> 01:00:25.743]  I can't tell you that you don't get an effect on me because I listen to you every day, but even them, you know, afterwards they bought the new Terror Storm DVD.
[01:00:25.763 --> 01:00:29.105]  They're back there making copies for their friends already.
[01:00:29.905 --> 01:00:32.907]  Such a powerful effect on people when you meet people in person.
[01:00:35.223 --> 01:00:44.946]  For the listeners out there, Alex was walking around that whole convention totally accessible, not quarantined off or anything like that.
[01:00:45.006 --> 01:00:52.888]  He was operating just like an average person, and that's what was so nice to see.
[01:00:52.908 --> 01:00:57.269]  I was almost embarrassed to come up to you and just say thanks, because I could tell you were busy.
[01:00:58.447 --> 01:00:59.808]  Well, that's one of my great frustrations.
[01:00:59.848 --> 01:01:02.810]  I wish I could read all the emails, respond to all the letters, shake all the hands.
[01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:05.732]  A lot of times I felt bad because I was doing a lot of the work.
[01:01:05.772 --> 01:01:12.376]  I'd have to run, go do this, run, go do that, meet Charlie Sheen, you know, when he pulled in, you know, try to take him to where he was going.
[01:01:12.716 --> 01:01:14.237]  Some people would be like, Alex, Alex, take a picture.
[01:01:14.277 --> 01:01:15.198]  Alex, Alex, shake my hand.
[01:01:15.238 --> 01:01:17.439]  A few times I couldn't do it and people would get a little irritated.
[01:01:17.459 --> 01:01:18.620]  I had to run past them.
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:20.101]  But yeah, I tried to be accessible.
[01:01:20.921 --> 01:01:21.922]  I totally understand that.
[01:01:22.002 --> 01:01:26.385]  And, you know, one of the things that came out of this meeting, too, is just a refocusing
[01:01:27.583 --> 01:01:28.403]  All the information.
[01:01:28.443 --> 01:01:52.392]  For me, I'm an architect here in San Diego and the whole structural collapse of the Twin Towers for me, it was so many films and just the analysis that was done by the professor, it just makes me go back to my original structural courses back at the University of Michigan and think about
[01:01:53.177 --> 01:01:58.700]  The impossibility of those towers collapsing symmetrical when you have asymmetrical loading at the top.
[01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:00.560]  There's going to be rotation.
[01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:02.501]  That rotation produces movement.
[01:02:03.662 --> 01:02:07.043]  It's just impossible, even if you accept the original story that the steel weakened.
[01:02:07.203 --> 01:02:12.826]  So, I hope the professional community out there really just refocuses in on this and
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:14.581]  You know, get the word out.
[01:02:15.321 --> 01:02:16.943]  Engineers, architects, everybody out there.
[01:02:17.023 --> 01:02:28.753]  Think how arrogant, John, the globalists are, that they think they could blow up three buildings in front of us when it goes against all the laws of science and the knowledge and the data we have.
[01:02:29.173 --> 01:02:30.834]  That's how dumb they think we are.
[01:02:32.296 --> 01:02:32.996]  That's the other thing, too.
[01:02:34.208 --> 01:02:38.930]  The arrogance and stupidity of the elite was just again demonstrated.
[01:02:38.970 --> 01:02:39.470]  Humorous!
[01:02:41.130 --> 01:02:41.991]  That's all I have to say, Alex.
[01:02:42.031 --> 01:02:42.891]  Thank you.
[01:02:42.931 --> 01:02:44.712]  Hey, did you like the conference overall?
[01:02:44.732 --> 01:02:45.972]  Oh, it was great.
[01:02:46.072 --> 01:02:56.396]  I mean, the location, you know, being an architect, I felt like a little bit, I'm a little bit claustrophobic, so I don't like going down into basements or things like that, so I didn't quite like that.
[01:02:58.226 --> 01:03:05.909]  You know, hey, it was fun, it was totally... That's right, we were two floors under, but that's kind of good.
[01:03:06.089 --> 01:03:07.530]  See, I like being down in a bunker.
[01:03:08.490 --> 01:03:13.732]  But it was the second biggest meeting hall in a hotel, so that's why we had to choose it.
[01:03:14.812 --> 01:03:19.394]  Well, that's fine, and we all enjoyed it.
[01:03:20.895 --> 01:03:26.157]  Being in person with other people, and physical connections between people,
[01:03:26.892 --> 01:03:27.292]  It's paramount.
[01:03:27.332 --> 01:03:29.113]  It's, you know, the human condition.
[01:03:29.153 --> 01:03:29.514]  It's nice.
[01:03:30.254 --> 01:03:30.734]  I hear you.
[01:03:30.754 --> 01:03:31.895]  Good to talk to you, my friend.
[01:03:31.915 --> 01:03:32.716]  Appreciate the call.
[01:03:32.756 --> 01:03:37.599]  We're going to come back to Professor Jim Fetzer, other callers that are holding, like Jim in Texas and others.
[01:03:37.899 --> 01:03:39.920]  We'll get to your calls early in this hour, so stay with us.
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:43.142]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:43.202 --> 01:03:46.584]  Terror Storm is available on DVD.
[01:03:46.664 --> 01:03:47.525]  I'm not going to wait.
[01:03:47.885 --> 01:03:49.486]  We're burning copies right here at the office.
[01:03:49.526 --> 01:03:51.347]  If you want one, go to the website and get it.
[01:03:54.733 --> 01:03:57.575]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.836 --> 01:03:59.417]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.757 --> 01:04:04.421]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.781 --> 01:04:11.507]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:11.827 --> 01:04:13.809]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:14.009 --> 01:04:16.851]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.952 --> 01:04:21.616]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.836 --> 01:04:26.220]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:33.706]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:33.946 --> 01:04:36.368]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.
[01:04:36.528 --> 01:04:38.270]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[01:04:54.494 --> 01:04:57.515]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:04:57.855 --> 01:05:06.658]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:05:06.978 --> 01:05:11.660]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:18.845]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:05:19.246 --> 01:05:31.015]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:31.515 --> 01:05:35.976]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:05:36.136 --> 01:05:40.738]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:40.918 --> 01:05:44.259]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:05:44.339 --> 01:05:47.039]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:05:47.059 --> 01:05:50.620]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:51.901]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:53.681 --> 01:05:59.643]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:06:09.161 --> 01:06:10.222]  We're good to go.
[01:06:31.035 --> 01:06:31.515]  We're good to go.
[01:06:54.466 --> 01:06:56.627]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:57.227 --> 01:07:00.068]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:00.828 --> 01:07:08.771]  As of 8 minutes, 14 seconds into the noontime hour, we don't have... I just sprung this on my people.
[01:07:08.811 --> 01:07:12.212]  We don't have it posted yet on themfallwarriors.com, prisonplanet.com.
[01:07:13.173 --> 01:07:17.314]  A link to the Yahoo shopping cart so you can order copies on DVD of Terror Storm.
[01:07:17.334 --> 01:07:18.955]  But it will be up there in the next hour.
[01:07:19.555 --> 01:07:21.075]  And then Ryan's gonna do a write-up on it.
[01:07:21.115 --> 01:07:22.496]  We're all just slaving here.
[01:07:23.443 --> 01:07:30.926]  And I'm not going to wait a month to put out the official DVD because we're still producing the extras that are going to go on it.
[01:07:31.467 --> 01:07:33.587]  We're tightening up a little bit of the music and the audio.
[01:07:33.647 --> 01:07:35.348]  It's really almost imperceptible stuff.
[01:07:36.469 --> 01:07:41.151]  So I'm going to go ahead and offer burned DVD copies that work on all DVD players right out of my office.
[01:07:41.571 --> 01:07:42.771]  I'm going to sign each one.
[01:07:42.791 --> 01:07:47.273]  We've already got, what, 450 or so that we didn't sell at the conference.
[01:07:47.293 --> 01:07:50.915]  I wanted to have right around, I guess we actually took a little over a thousand there.
[01:07:51.522 --> 01:07:53.163]  We've got about 400, 500 left.
[01:07:53.243 --> 01:07:54.344]  I'm just going to sell those.
[01:07:54.745 --> 01:07:58.808]  When those are gone, you'll then have to wait for the big official DVD that'll come out.
[01:07:58.828 --> 01:08:00.589]  And the way it's looking, it may be more than a month.
[01:08:00.990 --> 01:08:03.952]  So I want to just get these DVDs out now because it's so important.
[01:08:03.992 --> 01:08:08.636]  So, in the next hour or so, you'll be able to call toll-free 1-888-253-3139 to get your copy, or you'll be able to go to InfoWars.com.
[01:08:14.426 --> 01:08:17.009]  To get a copy via the Safe, Secure Online Shopping Cart.
[01:08:17.029 --> 01:08:22.054]  And the menu of this DVD says American Scholar Symposium Special Edition and it will be signed.
[01:08:22.454 --> 01:08:24.616]  And so, if you want to get them, don't wait.
[01:08:24.636 --> 01:08:26.058]  And then later, I really want one of those.
[01:08:26.078 --> 01:08:26.999]  Can you make me another one?
[01:08:27.059 --> 01:08:27.279]  No.
[01:08:27.739 --> 01:08:29.001]  When we're done with these, that's it.
[01:08:30.262 --> 01:08:31.303]  So, they're there.
[01:08:31.323 --> 01:08:32.044]  They're available.
[01:08:32.444 --> 01:08:33.385]  If you want them, get them.
[01:08:34.206 --> 01:08:38.390]  Alright, going to Professor Jim Fetzer, who is the founder of the 9-11 Scholars for Truth.
[01:08:38.996 --> 01:08:42.139]  He did a great job on Fox News exposing 9-11 as an inside job.
[01:08:42.459 --> 01:08:44.681]  He was one of our key speakers at the event this weekend.
[01:08:45.101 --> 01:08:46.943]  Professor Fetzer, good to have you on with us.
[01:08:47.023 --> 01:08:48.824]  Well, terrific Alex, great to talk again.
[01:08:49.465 --> 01:08:52.547]  Jim, what did you think overall of the conference?
[01:08:52.587 --> 01:08:54.929]  Give us your analysis, give us your review, give us your take.
[01:08:55.209 --> 01:09:00.614]  Well, Alex, you actually put together and conducted a world-class event.
[01:09:01.194 --> 01:09:03.296]  I seriously doubt
[01:09:03.812 --> 01:09:10.561]  That there will ever be another that will equal this one in its organization, clarity, impact.
[01:09:10.801 --> 01:09:17.009]  It was altogether really far exceeded anyone's realistic expectations.
[01:09:17.109 --> 01:09:19.072]  It was simply splendid.
[01:09:20.632 --> 01:09:45.426]  Well, I'll tell you, that feels really good because we spent months and months on this and we tried to treat the speakers well, we tried to pay for everything, we tried to make it a good event, we tried to organize it well, which I don't want to poo-poo some of the other events, I think they're all very important and valid, but I hope this sets a new standard because all the speakers told me, we've never been treated this good, it's never been this good, people who've been to a bunch of other conferences said this far eclipses anything we've ever seen.
[01:09:45.706 --> 01:09:53.174]  Well, I think that's absolutely right, and as you know, there on the occasion I was complimenting your staff.
[01:09:53.634 --> 01:09:58.519]  Kevin, Ryan, and everyone else were simply marvelous, totally professional.
[01:09:58.919 --> 01:10:06.447]  The quality of the work, because I reviewed the first 10 or 12 minutes of my Saturday presentation, was superlative.
[01:10:07.269 --> 01:10:14.331]  I'm terribly, terribly impressed, Alex, and I want to commend you for having a completely professional organization.
[01:10:14.611 --> 01:10:15.552]  Well, they're great guys.
[01:10:15.592 --> 01:10:16.772]  I hope they're listening in there.
[01:10:16.792 --> 01:10:18.172]  They're probably too busy to be listening.
[01:10:18.232 --> 01:10:19.773]  But, yeah, good job, gentlemen.
[01:10:19.793 --> 01:10:26.755]  They're on the phone right now trying to find out when C-SPAN is really going to air our one-hour, 48-minute presentation that C-SPAN still told us we could have two hours.
[01:10:27.055 --> 01:10:32.797]  First, it was an hour and a half, and they said two hours, and they said it's better to cut it a little bit short, so we did an hour and 48 minutes, 10 seconds.
[01:10:33.357 --> 01:10:35.778]  And we'll see if C-SPAN has the nerve to air this.
[01:10:36.458 --> 01:10:38.799]  First off, we need to thank C-SPAN for being there and covering it.
[01:10:39.199 --> 01:10:41.320]  We need to make sure that it ends up on air.
[01:10:41.741 --> 01:10:47.443]  The C-SPAN staff that was there, who didn't have control over that, said that they thought it was one of the best ever.
[01:10:47.863 --> 01:10:48.744]  They were very impressed.
[01:10:48.764 --> 01:10:50.685]  They said that it'll probably air three times.
[01:10:51.305 --> 01:10:54.186]  It could start anywhere from tomorrow to the first airing being this weekend.
[01:10:54.226 --> 01:10:55.027]  We don't know yet.
[01:10:55.327 --> 01:10:58.729]  We're on the phone with those guys right now, but we need to find out.
[01:10:59.109 --> 01:10:59.529]  Wonderful.
[01:10:59.569 --> 01:11:00.249]  Yeah, terrific.
[01:11:00.309 --> 01:11:02.730]  I'm glad they were giving you that feedback already, Alex.
[01:11:02.810 --> 01:11:04.651]  This is terribly important.
[01:11:06.294 --> 01:11:11.539]  They have to know the truth about their country and their government and what happened on 9-11.
[01:11:11.579 --> 01:11:15.282]  Well, if they do, Eric, there's never been a C-SPAN presentation like this.
[01:11:15.542 --> 01:11:16.803]  That's for sure.
[01:11:17.564 --> 01:11:18.745]  I share that sentiment.
[01:11:18.845 --> 01:11:25.571]  I think this could make a real difference and contribute to the magnitude of the accomplishment of this symposium.
[01:11:26.454 --> 01:11:36.320]  Well, they say they're going to air it, it's on the record they're going to air it, so they'll be eating crow if they don't, but we have the entire thing shot from three different camera angles, so we'll put it out for free if they don't.
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:39.602]  Yeah, I think the sooner we can get this out, Alex, the better.
[01:11:39.842 --> 01:11:44.945]  And even the audio, you know, if you put out the audio to begin with, but so much of the evidence is visual.
[01:11:45.346 --> 01:11:49.848]  Seeing the towers come down is not the same thing as hearing about the towers come down.
[01:11:50.089 --> 01:11:53.451]  Seeing the blanks, the gaps, the absence of a 757 in the Pentagon,
[01:11:56.193 --> 01:11:59.114]  videotapes is not the same thing as merely hearing about it.
[01:11:59.154 --> 01:12:08.055]  Seeing photographs of the ridiculous crash site in Shanksville is not the same thing as merely hearing about it.
[01:12:08.095 --> 01:12:12.696]  This was an extraordinary combination of visual and auditory evidence.
[01:12:12.716 --> 01:12:15.117]  The explanations were so good.
[01:12:15.197 --> 01:12:20.278]  The people you picked were just so perfect for their roles, Alex, and the organization.
[01:12:21.078 --> 01:12:24.139]  I'm very particular about organization.
[01:12:24.179 --> 01:12:25.599]  I've done a huge amount of editing.
[01:12:27.168 --> 01:12:36.153]  I have myself chaired or co-chaired national conferences before at least four times, and I just thought your organization was brilliant.
[01:12:36.293 --> 01:12:37.534]  It was exactly right.
[01:12:38.275 --> 01:12:39.155]  Well, thanks a lot, Jim.
[01:12:39.816 --> 01:12:40.656]  Jim, I want to shift gears.
[01:12:40.736 --> 01:12:51.283]  Tell us, because we really haven't done this probably in the last five or six interviews I've done with you in the last year, tell us about Jim Fetzer, your background, some of your life experiences that prepared you to be able to face up to 9-11.
[01:12:52.509 --> 01:13:04.955]  Well, my background, Alex, includes graduating from Princeton University with a degree in philosophy and being commissioned second lieutenant in the Marine Corps.
[01:13:05.015 --> 01:13:15.159]  I was in the Navy regular program, which meant that the Navy was actually paying for my undergraduate education in return for my agreeing to serve for a minimum of four years as a commissioned officer in the Navy or Marine Corps.
[01:13:15.699 --> 01:13:16.780]  I was in the Far East
[01:13:17.188 --> 01:13:25.431]  I was trained, of course, as all Marine Corps officers are initially, as an infantry officer, and subsequently took artillery training at Fort Sill and Lawton, Oklahoma.
[01:13:25.452 --> 01:13:27.432]  Wound up in the Far East for 13 months.
[01:13:28.113 --> 01:13:42.419]  This was, uh, I graduated in 62, so I was in the Corps from 62 to 66, and pulled a tour of the Far East, and based in Okinawa, several train ops in Japan, in Korea, in Formosa, in the Philippines, R&R in Hong Kong.
[01:13:42.459 --> 01:13:43.159]  We came close
[01:13:43.737 --> 01:13:47.479]  to having anything to do with Vietnam when the Diem brothers were assassinated.
[01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:55.505]  My unit was flapped out and stationed off the coast to cover the evacuation of American civilians if it became necessary, but it did not.
[01:13:55.665 --> 01:14:08.333]  I was anchored out in Kaohsiung Harbor in Formosa when Jack was whacked, and of course, eventually when I returned to the United States, and many, many years later, I become deeply, deeply involved in investigating the death of JFK.
[01:14:09.454 --> 01:14:12.516]  When did the lightbulb go off over Professor Jim Fetzer's brain?
[01:14:13.254 --> 01:14:13.874]  In relation to 9-11?
[01:14:13.894 --> 01:14:22.198]  No, I mean, just a pair of politics, New World Order activity, global crime rings... Well, it's really been gradually growing, you know.
[01:14:22.238 --> 01:14:37.824]  Now, at this point, I've done 35 years of teaching of logic, critical thinking, and scientific reasoning, and more and more, I appreciate the importance of integrating issues going on in domestic politics and foreign affairs into my courses, so that typically, in the course in critical thinking,
[01:14:38.354 --> 01:14:55.661]  I'll draw in issues like global warming, or tax cuts for the rich, or reasons to go to war in Iraq, or 9-11 as illustrations, because if my students can't take their critical thinking ability outside the classroom and apply it in real life, then I have been a failure as a teacher.
[01:14:56.261 --> 01:15:06.985]  I think that it was the early work by Thierry Meissen about the Pentagon and the complete absence of evidence that a Boeing 757 had hit the building that first captivated my attention.
[01:15:07.863 --> 01:15:18.828]  And I studied his, you know, the Boeing, the website that his son had set up, and then read his books about Pentagate and 9-11, the big lie, which I found very convincing.
[01:15:19.309 --> 01:15:36.697]  And subsequently, David Ray Griffin, who became familiar with my work on JFK, where I have published three edited collections bringing the best experts on different aspects of the case together, one's called Assassination Science, the second, Murder in Dealey Plaza, the third, The Great Zapruder Film Hoax,
[01:15:37.230 --> 01:16:03.245]  approached me about us collaborating on something on 9-11 and JFK and I began looking into David Ray Griffin's work and getting drawn into these discussion groups on the internet and then in the mid-December I saw so much talent and expertise there that it dawned on me that having some kind of loose affiliation creating a society might be a good idea and I went about, you know, invited Steve Jones to be my co-chair and founder of Scholars for 9-11 Truth
[01:16:05.310 --> 01:16:09.711]  And that's important because the establishment likes to single out individuals and act like you're alone.
[01:16:10.312 --> 01:16:10.632]  Nuts!
[01:16:10.712 --> 01:16:15.173]  But you can't ignore over 300 prominent scholars, scientists, and experts.
[01:16:15.353 --> 01:16:16.974]  Yeah, I think Ollie was kind of floored.
[01:16:16.994 --> 01:16:20.135]  You know, I think he was going to suggest it was kind of like a bridge group.
[01:16:20.175 --> 01:16:26.897]  You know, there might be four or five of us who got together to maybe smoke pot, you know, and play canasta for all I know.
[01:16:27.915 --> 01:16:32.579]  This Kennedy and Combs thing was such a fascinating experience, Alex.
[01:16:32.639 --> 01:16:33.660]  Yeah, let's talk about that.
[01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:34.301]  Tell us about that.
[01:16:34.601 --> 01:16:36.422]  Well, it was a classic bait-and-switch.
[01:16:36.683 --> 01:16:43.108]  I was contacted by the producer and said he wanted to have me on so they could discuss the findings of Scholars for 9-11 Truth.
[01:16:43.849 --> 01:16:47.011]  And, of course, that sounded terrific to me.
[01:16:47.472 --> 01:16:50.955]  And as I was driving in from the airport in the cab,
[01:16:51.457 --> 01:16:54.898]  And I actually stopped to have lunch with a friend before I got to the Sheraton.
[01:16:54.978 --> 01:16:55.378]  Exactly.
[01:16:55.419 --> 01:17:01.541]  They accused you of bait and switch and being dishonest, but they really clearly set the whole thing up to then claim you were dishonest.
[01:17:01.761 --> 01:17:02.561]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:17:02.601 --> 01:17:04.562]  Yeah, it was completely the opposite.
[01:17:04.582 --> 01:17:15.486]  So I spent 15 to 17 minutes giving their producer, a guy named Thomas in New York, a very clear, lucid summarization of our findings.
[01:17:16.170 --> 01:17:22.593]  And he not only, you know, was very attentive, but he even said he agreed with me about a lot of that points and found it very interesting.
[01:17:22.633 --> 01:17:27.456]  But then he said something I knew couldn't be true, that they had a fire drill and he had to take a break.
[01:17:27.536 --> 01:17:36.741]  Now, what I believe was going on was, he was running this by one of his superiors, maybe all the way up to Roger Ailes, for all I know, trying to figure out what spin to take.
[01:17:37.221 --> 01:17:41.063]  And half an hour later, I hadn't heard from him, so I called him back.
[01:17:41.644 --> 01:17:45.285]  And he said, he just wanted to know if I taught this stuff in any courses.
[01:17:45.305 --> 01:17:48.706]  And I said, well, in my class, and I have courses on it.
[01:17:48.726 --> 01:17:51.886]  And I said, well, in my critical thinking, I might use it as an example.
[01:17:52.247 --> 01:17:58.928]  But I also said I had a dean who invited me to do a course on GFK, but that I never got around to it.
[01:17:59.468 --> 01:18:02.149]  And so I'm being prepared later that afternoon.
[01:18:02.169 --> 01:18:07.010]  I'm being driven out to the studio, and it takes 45 minutes to get from the Sheraton out to the studio.
[01:18:07.731 --> 01:18:19.498]  And I get there after the show has already begun, so I have them set up a TV in the make-up room, and five minutes before I'm to go on, I see how they're spinning it.
[01:18:19.538 --> 01:18:25.322]  They're saying this is, you know, a university professor teaching our children, you know, conspiracy theories.
[01:18:25.842 --> 01:18:31.566]  And a smile came over my face, because I knew they didn't know enough about what they were talking about to be able to pull this off.
[01:18:32.156 --> 01:18:33.497]  Professor Fetzer, stay there.
[01:18:33.517 --> 01:18:37.360]  We're going to come back and talk for another segment, then return in the next and take calls.
[01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:38.501]  Toll-free number to join us.
[01:18:38.521 --> 01:18:43.425]  If you'd like to talk to Professor Jim Fetzer, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:18:43.465 --> 01:18:50.790]  And we have the Chinese-American doctor who confronted Bush and the Chinese dictator joining us as well in the next hour.
[01:18:54.113 --> 01:18:56.414]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:56.935 --> 01:18:59.697]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:00.695 --> 01:19:10.369]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it is possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:15.076]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Inc.'
[01:19:15.036 --> 01:19:16.458]  's patented methodology.
[01:19:17.228 --> 01:19:28.055]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[01:19:28.676 --> 01:19:31.177]  Star War technology at its best.

[01:19:48.445 --> 01:19:51.287]  Currency devaluation, inflation, one and the same.
[01:19:51.307 --> 01:19:59.773]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%,
[01:20:07.890 --> 01:20:13.372]  In a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:20:13.773 --> 01:20:16.914]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:20:17.154 --> 01:20:18.995]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:20:19.055 --> 01:20:22.076]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:20:22.617 --> 01:20:24.837]  Here is reality.
[01:20:25.198 --> 01:20:28.799]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:20:29.299 --> 01:20:32.941]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:20:33.501 --> 01:20:36.343]  Gold, in the same time frame, increased 35% in value.
[01:20:37.682 --> 01:20:41.405]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.
[01:20:41.745 --> 01:20:42.926]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.

[01:20:54.582 --> 01:21:03.649]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:21:03.889 --> 01:21:15.138]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:21:15.478 --> 01:21:21.183]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:21:21.423 --> 01:21:28.069]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:21:28.289 --> 01:21:35.115]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:21:35.375 --> 01:21:37.156]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[01:21:37.417 --> 01:21:39.478]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.

[01:21:57.690 --> 01:21:59.871]  Or maybe weight management has always been a problem?
[01:22:00.371 --> 01:22:05.754]  Are you frustrated, burned out, and tired of fad diets and marketing gimmicks that don't really work?
[01:22:06.275 --> 01:22:12.158]  Do you want a proven system, a long-term solution, to live a healthier lifestyle and properly manage your weight?

[01:22:54.517 --> 01:22:57.300]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:01.203]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:06.208 --> 01:23:09.030]  Monday through Friday, 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[01:23:09.410 --> 01:23:11.512]  Your calls are coming up, toll free number, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:23:11.532 --> 01:23:13.814]  Professor Jones, I'm going back to the conference.
[01:23:19.389 --> 01:23:21.350]  Professor Fetzer, I was thinking of Professor Jones.
[01:23:21.790 --> 01:23:29.394]  What did you think of Professor Jones' new information, his presentation with the thermite, the thermate, the test?
[01:23:29.494 --> 01:23:42.220]  Every step of the way, as Professor Jones tests his hypothesis, it continually is proven, and now he has other professors and other universities that are peer reviewing what he's done, and they're finding the exact same elements.
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:47.163]  I mean, this is the exact signature, not just of thermite used as cutting charges, but
[01:23:48.706 --> 01:23:54.347]  Thermate, the patented type that is specifically used for cutting pillars.
[01:23:54.767 --> 01:23:55.767]  Absolutely right, Alex.
[01:23:55.787 --> 01:23:57.868]  This is absolutely dynamite stuff.
[01:23:57.888 --> 01:24:02.729]  This is so important and so really essentially conclusive from a scientific point of view.
[01:24:02.749 --> 01:24:08.450]  NIST had conceded that they found residue of sulfur on the steel, which they could not explain.
[01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:14.231]  Then Steve discovered that the thermite itself was detectable on the steel.
[01:24:14.716 --> 01:24:36.875]  And I spoke to him on Sunday, actually Monday, about whether or not the thermate, if it were in, for example, a nano-enhanced super thermate version, would be powerful enough to pulverize all of that concrete, office furniture, and so forth, into very fine dust.
[01:24:37.235 --> 01:24:40.218]  And he told me that, in his opinion, he believed it would be.
[01:24:40.686 --> 01:24:46.308]  Because some persons had suggested, well, the thermite might be enough to cut the steel, but not to pulverize the concrete.
[01:24:46.348 --> 01:24:47.748]  So that was a key point on which I wanted to confirm.
[01:24:47.768 --> 01:24:54.191]  Well, it's actually patented that there's a type of hyperthermate itself that is explosive in nature.
[01:24:54.631 --> 01:24:54.911]  Yes.
[01:24:56.131 --> 01:24:57.092]  Well, it's fantastic.
[01:24:57.132 --> 01:25:00.653]  I mean, as you say, all the results, you know, the further we go, the more confirmation.
[01:25:00.993 --> 01:25:04.354]  This is typical of scientific inquiry, when you're on the right track, see?
[01:25:04.795 --> 01:25:10.922]  You take out a hypothesis and derive all the consequences that must be true if the hypothesis is true and then proceed to test them.
[01:25:11.342 --> 01:25:24.036]  And what's going on is a series of tests that are being conducted in relation to the hypothesis that the buildings were brought down by controlled demolitions using these very sophisticated forms of explosives or
[01:25:26.336 --> 01:25:31.778]  Otherwise described modes of destruction is being confirmed right and left.
[01:25:31.858 --> 01:25:33.439]  So this is fantastic stuff.
[01:25:33.679 --> 01:25:43.803]  And the government can't possibly account for it any more than it can count for the fact that the fires never reached the weakening point of steel, much less the melting point of steel.
[01:25:44.083 --> 01:25:51.426]  Any more than it can explain that the impact of the aircraft had negligible effects on those buildings given their sophisticated load redistribution capabilities.
[01:25:51.786 --> 01:25:55.688]  Any more than it can account for the buildings coming down at the speed of free fall
[01:25:56.667 --> 01:26:01.874]  On a pancake theory account when in fact there is no pancakes left when it's all said and done, Alex.
[01:26:02.344 --> 01:26:09.767]  If the building is a pancake, you should have a stack of different floors all collapsed on top of one another, but of course... Not exploding outward a mile!
[01:26:09.867 --> 01:26:10.527]  Blowing up!
[01:26:10.607 --> 01:26:16.890]  This whole thing was blowing up one floor at a time from the top down in a very sophisticated form that had to be under computerized control.
[01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:24.593]  Well, now more and more videos coming out as more and more of it gets released, and you can see giant explosions before it even collapses floor by floor.
[01:26:24.793 --> 01:26:25.714]  That's right, that's right.
[01:26:26.014 --> 01:26:31.356]  Even at 9-11 Revisited, you can see a whole floor going out just before it's enveloped by that cloud of dust and debris.
[01:26:33.604 --> 01:26:34.385]  You're absolutely right.
[01:26:34.585 --> 01:26:36.426]  Where is the establishment going to go from here?
[01:26:36.486 --> 01:26:41.849]  I mean, exponentially, geometrically, more scholars, more experts, more scientists, the underwriters of the building.
[01:26:43.190 --> 01:26:44.491]  Mr. Ryan's gone public.
[01:26:45.632 --> 01:26:50.595]  Number one, did the establishment think that it would come out this fast, or were they hubris?
[01:26:50.615 --> 01:26:51.396]  Were they arrogant?
[01:26:51.656 --> 01:26:54.518]  And then number two, how fast do you think it's going to be exposed now?
[01:26:55.098 --> 01:27:02.619]  Well, to tell the truth, I think they thought they got away with it because their initial techniques of distraction, you know, are as masterful as those of David Copperfield.
[01:27:02.679 --> 01:27:15.142]  And if it hadn't been for people like you for talk radio and the Internet, Alex, I think, you know, it's entirely possible they might have got away with it because they use massive distractions like the war in Afghanistan and the war in Iraq.
[01:27:15.162 --> 01:27:19.122]  These guys are completely brilliant at the politics of distraction.
[01:27:19.623 --> 01:27:21.663]  So they have ignored it as long as they can.
[01:27:22.182 --> 01:27:45.026]  But I think that, you know, in combination with your efforts and scholars coming out where we, you know, the public can see that there's in fact a substantial group of experts who are substantiating and confirming the kinds of findings toward which you were pointing in the beginning is making a tremendous difference and the combination is politically explosive.
[01:27:45.686 --> 01:27:49.547]  My greatest concern is that as the threat of exposure increases,
[01:27:50.554 --> 01:28:11.626]  Their inclination to do something stunning and dramatic to distract attention or to resolve issues in their favor is going to increase and they may seek to resort either to the bombing of Iran, which if it occurs is going to go down as one of the greatest military blunders in history, or to fake another terrorist attack in the U.S.
[01:28:11.726 --> 01:28:15.168]  to suspend the Constitution and impose a police state.
[01:28:15.768 --> 01:28:18.250]  Those are the scenarios that I most fear.
[01:28:19.082 --> 01:28:22.124]  I've got one more question for you before we take calls on the other side.
[01:28:22.144 --> 01:28:23.906]  I want to talk about your courage.
[01:28:24.126 --> 01:28:25.887]  People always ask, well, why are you still alive?
[01:28:25.907 --> 01:28:27.288]  Well, why do you have the nerve to do this?
[01:28:27.308 --> 01:28:28.209]  Well, aren't you afraid?
[01:28:28.609 --> 01:28:34.754]  I want to get Jim Fetzer's comment on that on the other side, and we'll go right to your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:35.274 --> 01:28:35.995]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:28:36.035 --> 01:28:40.278]  My websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and JonesReport.com.
[01:28:44.301 --> 01:28:45.181]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.682 --> 01:28:47.183]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.175 --> 01:28:50.958]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.441 --> 01:28:56.783]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:28:57.023 --> 01:28:59.045]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:28:59.205 --> 01:29:06.251]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[01:29:06.531 --> 01:29:15.119]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[01:29:15.419 --> 01:29:20.104]  Now for the first time, Calbin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.

[01:29:42.429 --> 01:29:44.792]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[01:29:54.223 --> 01:29:57.787]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:29:57.827 --> 01:29:58.347]  are located?
[01:29:58.548 --> 01:30:01.931]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[01:30:02.151 --> 01:30:06.876]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[01:30:07.156 --> 01:30:12.141]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[01:30:12.401 --> 01:30:18.423]  Brewing environmental catastrophes, the safest cities, the best places for solar and wind energy, and much, much more.

[01:30:31.766 --> 01:30:31.986]  I think so.
[01:30:55.234 --> 01:31:01.581]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:31:01.961 --> 01:31:06.666]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency technology.
[01:31:06.987 --> 01:31:14.515]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequency.
[01:31:14.955 --> 01:31:21.840]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:23.421]  There are no side effects.

[01:32:57.227 --> 01:32:58.147]  Going back to Professor
[01:32:59.162 --> 01:32:59.942]  Jim Fetzer.
[01:32:59.982 --> 01:33:02.143]  Jim, I get these calls constantly.
[01:33:02.163 --> 01:33:04.764]  You know, well, how are you so brave if this is all true?
[01:33:04.824 --> 01:33:05.744]  Why are you doing what you're doing?
[01:33:05.784 --> 01:33:06.744]  And my answer is this.
[01:33:07.905 --> 01:33:13.966]  I'd have to be mindlessly, stupidly brave to know all this evil's going on and to not fight it.
[01:33:14.006 --> 01:33:16.047]  I mean, this is an instinctive thing for me to do.
[01:33:16.067 --> 01:33:25.710]  You know, that's my view on it, is how could I not know that they're murdering terrorists that killed all these people, they're destroying our freedoms, they're debasing our currency,
[01:33:26.531 --> 01:33:36.775]  They're passing all these horrible police state laws, and they're up there laughing at us, and frankly, I get to the point of, I mean, I'm not bragging, but it's weird.
[01:33:36.895 --> 01:33:53.202]  I'm not, I'm an average person, and about, excuse me, about three years ago, I'm there with my wife and son, my little bitty son, infant son, at a La Madeline restaurant here in Austin, and there's about 50 people in the dining room,
[01:33:54.036 --> 01:34:12.451]  Including employees, and I go to the bathroom, and I come walking out, and there's this big freak out, all these people around this woman, and she's sitting there choking, she's turning purple, she's starting to fall down on the table, and they're going, call 9-1-1, call 9-1-1, call 9-1-1, oh no, oh no, and they're just all standing around shaking their hands, men, women, and children.
[01:34:13.251 --> 01:34:16.612]  And literally then I had to push people out of my way physically.
[01:34:16.652 --> 01:34:17.613]  They were trying to stop me.
[01:34:17.633 --> 01:34:18.113]  Don't touch her!
[01:34:18.133 --> 01:34:18.613]  Don't touch her!
[01:34:19.033 --> 01:34:22.534]  And you know, I had like basic going back to Boy Scout CPR.
[01:34:22.615 --> 01:34:25.356]  I didn't even have a, you know, an official certification in it.
[01:34:25.716 --> 01:34:27.756]  But I knew how to do the Heimlich.
[01:34:28.117 --> 01:34:29.197]  And I picked her up.
[01:34:29.257 --> 01:34:30.077]  She was big.
[01:34:30.758 --> 01:34:31.318]  Grabbed her.
[01:34:31.398 --> 01:34:32.358]  Did two Heimlichs.
[01:34:32.558 --> 01:34:32.998]  And boom!
[01:34:33.018 --> 01:34:39.441]  This big old chunk of food, bread, and meat goes flying out a big... I mean, it was gross, folks.
[01:34:39.501 --> 01:34:41.422]  And then she starts gasping and thanking me.
[01:34:41.462 --> 01:34:42.462]  And I just got out of there.
[01:34:42.822 --> 01:34:45.551]  You know, in America, I'd probably get sued by one of the people I'd shoved aside.
[01:34:45.571 --> 01:34:47.938]  And it was the same thing.
[01:34:47.958 --> 01:34:50.044]  You know, my kids go to this place called Little Jim.
[01:34:50.845 --> 01:34:52.106]  Really nice folks here in Austin.
[01:34:52.126 --> 01:34:55.829]  They get to play on, you know, different acrobat things and trampolines and all this.
[01:34:55.869 --> 01:35:01.633]  And this little girl got between, uh, it's like a balance beam they walk across, but it's like a ladder.
[01:35:01.993 --> 01:35:03.854]  And she got down between it and couldn't get out.
[01:35:03.894 --> 01:35:05.516]  And it goes on for like ten minutes.
[01:35:05.536 --> 01:35:06.096]  She's crying.
[01:35:06.116 --> 01:35:06.977]  They don't know how to get her out.
[01:35:07.017 --> 01:35:07.757]  I walk over there.
[01:35:07.837 --> 01:35:09.218]  There's obviously a way to get her out.
[01:35:09.538 --> 01:35:12.080]  I just press her in a little bit and lift her up out of the top.
[01:35:12.100 --> 01:35:14.102]  They were trying to pull her down through it with her head.
[01:35:14.682 --> 01:35:16.643]  I pull her out and, oh, thank you so much.
[01:35:16.683 --> 01:35:16.964]  Thank you.
[01:35:17.144 --> 01:35:18.525]  Hey, folks, I'm just an average person.
[01:35:19.085 --> 01:35:24.328]  And my whole life, it's like I see idiots out on the boat on the lake all stuck, not knowing how to help themselves.
[01:35:24.368 --> 01:35:25.248]  Gotta get out and help them.
[01:35:25.529 --> 01:35:29.531]  And I grew up watching my father be like that, and that's how Americans were in the past, folks.
[01:35:29.831 --> 01:35:30.852]  So I see a problem.
[01:35:30.952 --> 01:35:34.534]  I don't... I don't... I mean, I've seen people intimidating somebody in the parking lot.
[01:35:35.114 --> 01:35:36.535]  You know, trying to basically rob them.
[01:35:36.735 --> 01:35:37.535]  That's how they do it.
[01:35:37.795 --> 01:35:38.936]  They'll just, hey, give me something.
[01:35:39.136 --> 01:35:40.177]  They don't say, hey, I'm robbing you.
[01:35:40.217 --> 01:35:40.958]  Hey, give me some money.
[01:35:40.998 --> 01:35:41.939]  Hey, you better give it to me.
[01:35:42.219 --> 01:35:48.166]  And they get up in their face, you know, two big thugs, and I, by myself, I just run over and say, let's rock, let's go.
[01:35:48.186 --> 01:35:51.129]  And I just shove one of the guys back into a car, because I don't care.
[01:35:51.470 --> 01:35:53.592]  A lot of people would call that stupid.
[01:35:54.278 --> 01:35:59.362]  A lot of people... I saw just a few months ago two guys out in the parking lot here late at night harassing some woman.
[01:35:59.402 --> 01:36:01.324]  I walked over and I said, you know, back off!
[01:36:01.584 --> 01:36:02.284]  What's your problem?
[01:36:02.625 --> 01:36:03.886]  I'm not a hero, folks.
[01:36:03.946 --> 01:36:07.969]  I want you to understand that we're all... Understand, I don't think about it when I see something.
[01:36:08.089 --> 01:36:09.250]  I just do it.
[01:36:09.510 --> 01:36:11.071]  Now, some people call that stupid.
[01:36:11.091 --> 01:36:16.555]  These yuppies think you get ahead in life by not caring, by not getting involved, by only caring about yourself.
[01:36:16.575 --> 01:36:22.220]  But when you've got a society, a sociological climate, where no one looks out for anybody, you have a hellhole.
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:23.380]  What was it?
[01:36:23.420 --> 01:36:31.764]  Four years ago, a cop at William Cannon and 183 up there by that Exxon station gets hit by a car.
[01:36:32.605 --> 01:36:36.787]  He's bleeding to death for 45 minutes, knocked over on the curb.
[01:36:37.227 --> 01:36:38.107]  He's in uniform.
[01:36:38.248 --> 01:36:39.088]  No one helps him.
[01:36:39.828 --> 01:36:40.729]  People didn't want to get involved.
[01:36:40.749 --> 01:36:43.210]  They didn't even call the police until another police car came along.
[01:36:44.292 --> 01:36:52.214]  Famous cases of a young woman up in Toronto raped on a major sidewalk for an hour and a half in this big telecom company.
[01:36:52.234 --> 01:36:53.274]  This was in mainstream news.
[01:36:54.034 --> 01:36:58.135]  The head guy at the company goes, quit looking out the windows, you know, and don't call the police.
[01:36:58.195 --> 01:36:59.055]  We don't want trouble.
[01:36:59.355 --> 01:37:01.196]  And she'd been beaten in the head with a lead pipe.
[01:37:01.776 --> 01:37:03.236]  And last time I heard she was in a coma.
[01:37:03.796 --> 01:37:06.097]  Until finally somebody came along and called the police.
[01:37:07.336 --> 01:37:14.642]  Again, Jim Fetzer, I didn't mean to go into that whole rant, but I don't understand how people, when they see a problem, don't get involved.
[01:37:14.662 --> 01:37:20.647]  Jim, can you speak to why you have courage, why you're still alive, if you do care about them killing you?
[01:37:20.667 --> 01:37:21.487]  I mean, tell us.
[01:37:22.188 --> 01:37:24.610]  Well, it's a combination of factors.
[01:37:24.690 --> 01:37:29.834]  One is philosophy demands great honesty and integrity.
[01:37:29.874 --> 01:37:33.617]  You can't do good philosophy if you don't have a profound commitment to truth.
[01:37:34.201 --> 01:37:38.223]  To rigor and reasoning and to science and evidence, number one.
[01:37:38.283 --> 01:37:50.567]  Number two, coming out of the Marine Corps, I acquired a tremendous dedication to my country and respect for the men who served in the armed forces and for the principles upon which it is founded.
[01:37:51.027 --> 01:37:59.530]  And third, here you have in 9-11, 3,000 innocent Americans who were subject to mass murder by their own government.
[01:37:59.650 --> 01:38:01.271]  Once I sorted that out, by God,
[01:38:01.693 --> 01:38:03.874]  My life is no more valuable than their lives.
[01:38:03.894 --> 01:38:07.375]  There are 3,000 who were sacrificed by these butchers.
[01:38:07.855 --> 01:38:14.677]  And to me, ultimately, Alex, it's so insulting that they should play the American people for suckers and saps, you know?
[01:38:15.097 --> 01:38:18.959]  Mulkey used to make the point in his movies, like the Maltese Falcon, you know?
[01:38:19.899 --> 01:38:22.460]  That he had a partner who was, you know, just another sucker.
[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:23.860]  Can you back off your phone a little bit?
[01:38:23.900 --> 01:38:25.781]  Professor, back off the phone a little bit.
[01:38:26.192 --> 01:38:35.938]  Who is just enough of a sucker that, you know, it's an insult to the American people, Alex, that they should try to pull this over on us and take our country away from us before our very eyes.
[01:38:36.383 --> 01:38:41.945]  Well, Americans were always known in the past for charging into trouble, standing up, getting involved, being go-getters.
[01:38:42.365 --> 01:38:52.309]  How have we gotten to the point where they let cops bleed to death in the street and rape young women beaten in the head, laying in the street, or people choking, everyone just wrings their hands?
[01:38:52.329 --> 01:38:55.970]  Alex, you're performing a Heimlich maneuver for the whole nation in your efforts.
[01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:57.511]  That's a great analogy.
[01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:59.531]  But I don't understand it.
[01:38:59.611 --> 01:39:02.073]  I mean, it's not, oh, you've got courage, thank you.
[01:39:02.453 --> 01:39:03.574]  It's what you're supposed to do.
[01:39:03.875 --> 01:39:04.615]  Of course it is.
[01:39:04.655 --> 01:39:06.357]  You're absolutely 100% right.
[01:39:06.797 --> 01:39:13.383]  And ordinary moral courage seems to be a commodity in short supply in the United States today.
[01:39:14.163 --> 01:39:19.708]  It has well been said that all that is required for evil to prosper is that good men should do nothing.
[01:39:20.288 --> 01:39:21.930]  We can't allow that to happen, Alex.
[01:39:22.372 --> 01:39:23.636]  We have to set the example.
[01:39:23.676 --> 01:39:24.699]  We have to encourage others.
[01:39:24.719 --> 01:39:25.682]  We have to inform them.
[01:39:25.723 --> 01:39:26.686]  We have to get the word out.
[01:39:26.986 --> 01:39:29.595]  And by God, you've been doing a great job at it, my friend.
[01:39:30.293 --> 01:39:32.674]  Well, no, I'm not trying to get you to toot my horn.
[01:39:32.714 --> 01:39:33.495]  I appreciate it.
[01:39:33.555 --> 01:39:35.056]  I'm not going to blow any smoke, buddy.
[01:39:35.096 --> 01:39:36.116]  You know me well enough.
[01:39:36.236 --> 01:39:37.177]  I don't mince words.
[01:39:37.277 --> 01:39:40.819]  I just say, you're doing something indispensable and I stand with you.
[01:39:41.139 --> 01:39:42.359]  Well, I stand with you, my friend.
[01:39:42.419 --> 01:39:48.322]  I'm just wondering where some of the other people in the public are, because a lot of people know the truth and they tell me, but I'm too afraid to do anything.
[01:39:48.663 --> 01:39:50.724]  Shouldn't we be more afraid of not doing nothing?
[01:39:50.984 --> 01:39:51.504]  Of course!
[01:39:51.984 --> 01:39:54.886]  This is the notification of the United States turning us into a police...
[01:39:55.393 --> 01:39:55.813]  Please stay.
[01:39:56.134 --> 01:40:03.180]  I could not believe the discovery that they're putting these huge NAFTA superhighways all the way through the country, and I've never heard a word of public debate about it.
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:07.223]  It's gonna divide the country into huge economic sectors.
[01:40:07.243 --> 01:40:16.931]  They have a master plan for it, and Alex, I suspect that's where the $2.3 trillion is gone to finance these massive construction projects, which are already underway in Texas.
[01:40:17.391 --> 01:40:17.692]  I know.
[01:40:18.484 --> 01:40:19.445]  You're absolutely right.
[01:40:19.565 --> 01:40:25.328]  It's just crisis after crisis, after giant criminal action, after giant criminal event.
[01:40:25.368 --> 01:40:25.808]  It is!
[01:40:25.848 --> 01:40:28.849]  You know, a lot of people maybe used to think you exaggerate.
[01:40:28.909 --> 01:40:41.136]  Well, you have great passion, and you're very... Once you focus on the facts, by God, it turns out, more often than not, you're exactly right, and you have understood, which is why I describe you as an early warning system.
[01:40:41.536 --> 01:40:42.657]  Well, I appreciate that, Jim.
[01:40:42.957 --> 01:40:44.217]  Let's go to call.
[01:40:44.257 --> 01:40:46.158]  Speaking of Jim, let's go to Jim in Texas.
[01:40:46.198 --> 01:40:46.959]  You're on the air, Jim.
[01:40:48.001 --> 01:40:48.241]  Yeah.
[01:40:48.401 --> 01:40:49.042]  Hey, Alex?
[01:40:50.403 --> 01:40:50.703]  Yeah?
[01:40:53.025 --> 01:41:05.534]  Not to take the shine or the luster off of Shane, sorry for that play on words, but, uh, I don't watch TV.
[01:41:06.095 --> 01:41:06.415]  At all.
[01:41:07.156 --> 01:41:16.583]  And when I do, watch an educational show occasionally, uh, I wouldn't think of watching a sitcom with a mindless
[01:41:17.868 --> 01:41:22.071]  The type that Mr. Shine stars in.
[01:41:23.132 --> 01:41:35.721]  But while all the big money guys headed out to La La Land, which is Los Angeles, and where there's very few angels, some of us were back here holding down the fort.
[01:41:36.897 --> 01:41:38.357]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:41:38.878 --> 01:42:03.284]  The reason we talk about Charlie Sheen, who is no angel, but most of what you hear about him is baloney, is because he had a lot to lose, and he did lose a lot, and he was attacked and told to shut up, and he had courage that nobody else in Hollywood had, and so I don't understand how we're bad to go get media attention and expose the New World Order, and to have these presentations and to come together, and I just don't understand how somebody could say, we're here holding down the fort.
[01:42:03.685 --> 01:42:04.905]  What does that mean, Jim?
[01:42:06.115 --> 01:42:06.655]  Jim Thatcher?
[01:42:06.755 --> 01:42:07.495]  Are you asking me?
[01:42:07.736 --> 01:42:19.219]  Well, this Charlie Sheen thing, you know, I was very curious in the story that went out on Reuters about our conference, Alex, where it was quoting, you know, someone who's there saying how Charlie Sheen gave our movement credibility.
[01:42:19.279 --> 01:42:20.639]  They were using the wrong word.
[01:42:20.679 --> 01:42:22.980]  What Charlie gives us is visibility.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.781]  We give Charlie Sheen credibility because
[01:42:26.315 --> 01:42:32.738]  We are the foundation, the resource, the researchers who have discovered the truth about these matters.
[01:42:33.078 --> 01:42:36.299]  Charlie Sheen has taken risks by speaking out.
[01:42:36.339 --> 01:42:37.339]  Yeah, he has a lot of courage.
[01:42:37.379 --> 01:42:39.600]  You know Reuters shopped for that quote.
[01:42:40.601 --> 01:42:42.802]  You know they were looking around for that.
[01:42:43.062 --> 01:42:44.242]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:42:44.262 --> 01:42:48.584]  To find somebody who had misstated or misdescribed the relationship between Charlie and the movement?
[01:42:48.744 --> 01:42:49.044]  Yes.
[01:42:49.224 --> 01:42:50.185]  Yeah, I think that's right.
[01:42:50.745 --> 01:42:53.486]  And of course, you know, I mean, the fact is that Charlie
[01:42:53.982 --> 01:43:00.543]  Although he is a star in a sitcom, and a lot of us would view that as rather trivial, he has a tremendous following.
[01:43:01.203 --> 01:43:03.884]  His father, of course, is a completely admirable guy.
[01:43:04.444 --> 01:43:18.926]  And, you know, it just brings attention to the movement, attention that we desperately need, especially when the vast majority of the population really haven't paid attention and have been taken in by the deceptive moves of this government.
[01:43:19.206 --> 01:43:20.007]  Look, it's simple.
[01:43:20.107 --> 01:43:21.927]  Charlie Sheen hit the barbed wire for us.
[01:43:23.575 --> 01:43:23.895]  That's right.
[01:43:24.215 --> 01:43:31.078]  And I want to add that for people who couldn't go to the conference, who might be soured to that, we're going to put a lot of the video out for free.
[01:43:31.659 --> 01:43:33.680]  We're going to play it here on the show for you.
[01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:35.040]  We did this for you folks.
[01:43:35.941 --> 01:43:38.442]  I mean, my guys are in there slaving right now to get it all out for you.
[01:43:39.937 --> 01:43:47.422]  I'm not going to try to get mad at that caller, but it gets a little frustrating when we're here working hard and then to just hear somebody kind of pick at something.
[01:43:47.722 --> 01:43:49.363]  They need to examine their psyche, I think.
[01:43:49.803 --> 01:43:56.848]  Alex, if you have the chance, I hope you can also put out a DVD with the whole conference on it, just as a, you know, something that people can...
[01:43:58.056 --> 01:44:02.800]  I think it'll be a tremendous, tremendous instrument for getting the truth out to the American people.
[01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:03.941]  No, we're going to do that.
[01:44:04.202 --> 01:44:06.063]  Dana in Connecticut, you're on the air.
[01:44:06.103 --> 01:44:06.484]  Go ahead.
[01:44:06.744 --> 01:44:07.925]  Thank you, Mr. Jones.
[01:44:08.285 --> 01:44:09.826]  Thank you, Dr. Fetzer, for your work.
[01:44:10.587 --> 01:44:12.188]  And it's a pleasure to speak with you today.
[01:44:12.849 --> 01:44:17.293]  I'd like to ask the question of Modus Operandi.
[01:44:18.214 --> 01:44:22.638]  Is this for a total police state, what happened at 9-11?
[01:44:23.198 --> 01:44:25.020]  Or is this to go to war?
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:28.762]  Sir, anything the globalists do is for a cocktail.
[01:44:28.942 --> 01:44:30.384]  They do a cost-benefit analysis.
[01:44:30.744 --> 01:44:34.087]  You know, they make almost $7 billion on the payout at the World Trade Centers.
[01:44:34.428 --> 01:44:37.811]  They get hundreds of billions in no-bid weapons contract sales.
[01:44:38.131 --> 01:44:41.455]  They get control of trillions of dollars of oil to then shut off the spigot.
[01:44:41.955 --> 01:44:44.078]  Well, I think they're trying to destroy the
[01:44:59.975 --> 01:45:13.505]  Sovereign integrity of the United States in order to abolish all the kinds of standards for protecting the environment, for protecting workers' rights, for protecting women's rights, children's rights.
[01:45:13.966 --> 01:45:22.112]  I think it's part and parcel of a master plan of globalization in which the world is ruled by corporations.
[01:45:22.796 --> 01:45:24.557]  Through the World Trade Organization.
[01:45:24.618 --> 01:45:28.020]  More and more this has become apparent to me.
[01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:30.002]  And understand folks, they're not free market.
[01:45:30.042 --> 01:45:33.805]  They use big government to go after their competition and criminally consolidate.
[01:45:34.005 --> 01:45:36.187]  Oh yeah, this is monopoly capitalism.
[01:45:36.227 --> 01:45:38.429]  This is nothing like Adam Smith described.
[01:45:38.469 --> 01:45:40.671]  This is exploitation.
[01:45:40.731 --> 01:45:42.632]  It's stealing natural resources.
[01:45:43.053 --> 01:45:45.475]  It's exploiting cheap labor.
[01:45:45.555 --> 01:45:46.996]  It's evading taxes.
[01:45:47.576 --> 01:45:50.619]  It's doing all these things that corporations
[01:45:52.165 --> 01:45:58.051]  It's organized crime that created world government and made themselves the boss.
[01:45:58.091 --> 01:45:58.651]  That's right.
[01:46:00.813 --> 01:46:03.416]  I'm a long time student of JFK.
[01:46:03.436 --> 01:46:06.439]  I don't want to go off track, but could I just ask you a question?
[01:46:06.619 --> 01:46:08.260]  Sure.
[01:46:09.962 --> 01:46:14.126]  Do you believe that either William Robert Greer or
[01:46:14.830 --> 01:46:17.172]  Charles Harrelson fired on the President?
[01:46:18.153 --> 01:46:22.998]  Probably not, but I mean, this is a fairly subtle business to go into.
[01:46:23.058 --> 01:46:30.866]  We don't need either Greer, who was a driver, of course, or Harrelson, who actually claimed that he fired one of the shots, to have fired to account for it.
[01:46:31.307 --> 01:46:36.552]  It's not impossible, but the weight of the evidence, I think, tends to be against it.
[01:46:36.957 --> 01:46:40.098]  But Harrelson is in federal prison right now for shooting a judge.
[01:46:40.298 --> 01:46:40.939]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:46:40.959 --> 01:46:43.320]  He assassinated a federal judge with a high-powered rifle.
[01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:46.521]  Very similar, very rare crime, and very analogous.
[01:46:46.641 --> 01:46:48.762]  Well, 243 from 400 yards in the neck.
[01:46:48.882 --> 01:46:51.143]  Well, Harrelson is a very intelligent guy.
[01:46:51.163 --> 01:46:59.266]  I was fascinated to watch him on an interview after he had said that he killed Kennedy, meaning he fired the fatal shot.
[01:46:59.647 --> 01:47:05.389]  Because he said, among other things, and denied it, he said he was out of his mind when he said it, in the very fact that he said it.
[01:47:05.908 --> 01:47:07.209]  Prove that he was out of his mind.
[01:47:07.249 --> 01:47:09.931]  That was a very ingenious way of trying to step out of the news.
[01:47:10.952 --> 01:47:15.316]  So, you're raising a very interesting, subtle question here about the identity of the shooters.
[01:47:15.396 --> 01:47:22.421]  Greer, of course, having been the driver, but based upon our research, he was a key player in setting Jack up for the hit.
[01:47:22.481 --> 01:47:24.803]  He actually pulled the limousine to the left into a hall.
[01:47:24.823 --> 01:47:28.226]  Now, we know Harrelson was at the railway station and was taken into custody that day.
[01:47:28.246 --> 01:47:28.706]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:47:28.726 --> 01:47:29.827]  Harrelson was absolutely there.
[01:47:29.867 --> 01:47:30.488]  Yeah, I've seen the...
[01:47:31.138 --> 01:47:38.769]  There are a couple of frames in footage from a recording of Wegman that actually show what looks like Harrelson and Charles.
[01:47:38.789 --> 01:47:42.474]  There was also a photo in the Dallas Times Herald now defunct of him with the police.
[01:47:42.675 --> 01:47:43.316]  Oh sure, sure.
[01:47:43.376 --> 01:47:44.898]  He was one of the three tramps, absolutely.
[01:47:44.918 --> 01:47:46.220]  He was the toss of the three tramps.
[01:47:46.854 --> 01:47:52.358]  I mean, you've got this tall, good-looking guy dressed up in an obvious costume, with the cops really just leading him away to safety.
[01:47:52.838 --> 01:47:56.961]  Well, they were taking him officially to the police headquarters, but they weren't booked and so forth.
[01:47:57.001 --> 01:47:58.862]  I mean, the whole thing was a staged event.
[01:47:58.982 --> 01:48:03.606]  And I know Woody Harrelson, and so it's really painful for him to hear about this.
[01:48:03.646 --> 01:48:03.986]  Yeah.
[01:48:04.810 --> 01:48:05.551]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:48:06.251 --> 01:48:07.612]  Look, that would be a long story.
[01:48:07.672 --> 01:48:09.093]  I'd love to get into it on another day.
[01:48:09.133 --> 01:48:09.834]  Thank you, caller.
[01:48:09.934 --> 01:48:10.554]  Thank you, caller.
[01:48:11.055 --> 01:48:13.857]  Professor Fetzer, I'm going to come back and take calls, but I'm going to let you get out of here.
[01:48:14.157 --> 01:48:14.797]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:48:15.118 --> 01:48:16.239]  Let me just ask you this question.
[01:48:16.279 --> 01:48:24.905]  Specifically, you personally, what do you think about the chances that they could plant something on you or poison you or shoot you and claim it was a carjacking?
[01:48:25.125 --> 01:48:26.446]  I mean, I know you know you're in danger.
[01:48:26.486 --> 01:48:28.007]  How did you make the decision to make the plunge?
[01:48:28.308 --> 01:48:30.289]  Well, Alex, they know where I am.
[01:48:30.389 --> 01:48:33.051]  Either you stand and fight for your country or you don't.
[01:48:33.091 --> 01:48:34.152]  And if you stand and fight,
[01:48:34.577 --> 01:48:37.178]  You put all the marbles in the game, man.
[01:48:37.258 --> 01:48:48.662]  I put all the marbles in the game, and I stand with you, and Steve Jones, and Bob Bowman, and Morgan Reynolds, and Kevin Ryan, and everyone else who cares about the truth and the future of this country.
[01:48:50.362 --> 01:48:52.463]  I just hope people know we've thrown in all the way.
[01:48:52.503 --> 01:48:54.444]  I mean, we've committed to defend this nation.
[01:48:54.464 --> 01:48:55.644]  We hope you'll join us, folks.
[01:48:56.625 --> 01:48:57.565]  By God, it's worth it.
[01:48:58.075 --> 01:49:01.056]  Now give us the website of the Scholars for 9-11 Truth and give us your website.
[01:49:01.076 --> 01:49:03.077]  The alternative is Freedom or Slavery.
[01:49:03.457 --> 01:49:04.298]  Scholars for Truth.
[01:49:04.598 --> 01:49:06.339]  S-T-9-11.org.
[01:49:06.859 --> 01:49:07.639]  S for Scholars.
[01:49:07.699 --> 01:49:08.419]  T for Truth.
[01:49:08.439 --> 01:49:09.640]  9-11.org.
[01:49:09.700 --> 01:49:10.680]  That's where you want to go.
[01:49:10.740 --> 01:49:14.382]  You can find all about us, how to reach me and so forth from that website.
[01:49:14.842 --> 01:49:17.125]  All right, Professor Fetzer, we'll talk to you again in the future.
[01:49:17.385 --> 01:49:18.626]  It was great seeing you.
[01:49:18.686 --> 01:49:19.687]  Oh, it was terrific, Alex.
[01:49:19.787 --> 01:49:20.828]  I can't thank you enough.
[01:49:20.848 --> 01:49:22.050]  This was a huge success.
[01:49:22.230 --> 01:49:25.353]  A tremendous blow in favor of truth and freedom.
[01:49:25.693 --> 01:49:26.634]  God bless you, my friend.
[01:49:26.654 --> 01:49:27.315]  Thank you so much.
[01:49:27.555 --> 01:49:28.096]  Take care.
[01:49:29.377 --> 01:49:31.860]  I was pretty shocked by that call, kind of criticizing us.
[01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:33.842]  I thought we were doing good here, but you know.
[01:49:34.691 --> 01:49:44.222]  And now all the attack pieces are coming out, and the Globalists really can't attack us directly through the mainstream media now because they've lost total credibility, so they have their operatives doing it from below, and that doesn't work either.
[01:49:44.262 --> 01:49:47.285]  So, I say to all those lying about us and attacking us, good!
[01:49:47.305 --> 01:49:48.286]  It means I'm over the target.
[01:49:48.707 --> 01:49:49.408]  Keep it up!
[01:49:49.468 --> 01:49:51.470]  You let me know right where the target is from the flack.
[01:49:54.102 --> 01:50:00.925]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:01.245 --> 01:50:02.625]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.805 --> 01:50:05.026]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:05.166 --> 01:50:07.267]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:07.527 --> 01:50:12.489]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.

[01:50:29.739 --> 01:50:31.640]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[01:53:14.794 --> 01:53:17.819]  I made a little over a thousand copies, sold around half of them at the event.
[01:53:18.640 --> 01:53:20.283]  They have their own little intro screen.
[01:53:20.343 --> 01:53:22.988]  This is 9-11, Scholars for Truth.
[01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:29.944]  Excuse me, American Scholars Symposium, 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda, and then it goes into Terror Storm.
[01:53:30.384 --> 01:53:37.228]  It just won't have the extras on it that we are just now putting together that will be on the official DVD available in about a month.
[01:53:37.248 --> 01:53:40.991]  We've got to finish this up, then send it off, have it mass produced, put in the cases.

[01:54:12.051 --> 01:54:13.711]  I'm going to get into Limbaugh and the drugs.
[01:54:13.731 --> 01:54:16.292]  This is important to show the hypocrisy.
[01:54:16.352 --> 01:54:17.453]  Bush ignoring the laws.
[01:54:17.513 --> 01:54:18.313]  More news on that.
[01:54:19.113 --> 01:54:25.936]  And we're scheduled to have the doctor, the American doctor, the Chinese-American doctor who confronted Bush and the Chinese dictator who got arrested.
[01:54:26.316 --> 01:54:27.617]  They've now had to drop those charges.
[01:54:27.637 --> 01:54:28.297]  That's good news.
[01:54:28.977 --> 01:54:31.798]  Right now though, let's go ahead and go to Bob in Mass.
[01:54:31.858 --> 01:54:32.659]  Bob, thanks for holding.
[01:54:33.419 --> 01:54:34.059]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:54:34.119 --> 01:54:34.459]  Good, sir.
[01:54:35.199 --> 01:54:36.520]  I just had a couple of questions.
[01:54:36.540 --> 01:54:38.741]  Do you have a section on your website there for
[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:51.683]  Anybody who wanted to, um, maybe some way to collect stories about, you know, people that have suspicions and whatnot about possible, um, it sounds crazy, but shipping in hospitals?
[01:54:51.763 --> 01:54:55.344]  It seems pretty random, but, um, it's kind of a concern.
[01:54:55.384 --> 01:54:59.725]  I mean, I think that they're just subjecting people to this without... Let me just say, people always say, can you do this?
[01:54:59.745 --> 01:55:00.245]  Can you do that?
[01:55:00.345 --> 01:55:01.285]  We can't do everything.
[01:55:01.305 --> 01:55:02.365]  I know you can't do everything.
[01:55:02.425 --> 01:55:08.467]  We, uh, we, uh, we like your suggestions, but what you should do as listeners is create your own websites.
[01:55:08.807 --> 01:55:08.947]  Yeah.
[01:55:09.753 --> 01:55:11.614]  But we do cover forced microchipping.
[01:55:11.654 --> 01:55:13.915]  They've had to pass a law in Wisconsin.
[01:55:13.935 --> 01:55:15.336]  The governor signed it two weeks ago.
[01:55:15.777 --> 01:55:19.999]  There are government leaders, presidents around the world trying to make people take them.
[01:55:20.459 --> 01:55:21.380]  It is a real threat.
[01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:22.460]  Yes it is.
[01:55:23.141 --> 01:55:24.522]  Alright, I guess that's it actually.
[01:55:24.562 --> 01:55:24.842]  Thank you.
[01:55:24.862 --> 01:55:25.402]  Okay, thank you.
[01:55:25.442 --> 01:55:26.223]  I appreciate that.
[01:55:26.243 --> 01:55:28.504]  Let's talk to Craig in California.
[01:55:28.544 --> 01:55:29.324]  Craig, you're on the air.
[01:55:31.346 --> 01:55:31.866]  Hey, Alex?
[01:55:32.086 --> 01:55:32.286]  Yes?
[01:55:32.806 --> 01:55:36.228]  I wanted to tell you that that conference was fantastic.
[01:55:37.049 --> 01:55:38.870]  I brought my brother from Ohio.
[01:55:39.315 --> 01:55:39.715]  to come out.
[01:55:39.735 --> 01:55:41.976]  He's an environmental scientist and he was a skeptic.
[01:55:42.536 --> 01:55:46.057]  And after we sat through that first day, he said it's a closed case.
[01:55:46.618 --> 01:55:50.199]  I mean, it's so evident that the government pulled that job off.
[01:55:51.259 --> 01:55:54.020]  Well, he needs to join the 9-11 Scholars then.
[01:55:55.881 --> 01:56:02.083]  Alex, I just have to say that Stephen Jones was fantastic.
[01:56:03.364 --> 01:56:05.945]  His evidence was like incontrovertible.
[01:56:06.705 --> 01:56:09.066]  And people really need to get your terror storm.
[01:56:09.696 --> 01:56:11.197]  It's a fantastic video.
[01:56:12.198 --> 01:56:13.620]  You had a chance to be there and see it.
[01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:14.180]  What did you think?
[01:56:15.481 --> 01:56:17.944]  The professionalism is at a whole new level.
[01:56:18.184 --> 01:56:21.807]  Like what your producers were saying about the sound and the graphics.
[01:56:22.468 --> 01:56:23.389]  It's fantastic!
[01:56:23.829 --> 01:56:29.514]  I mean it's really something that people need to go out and get because I mean the information is right there.
[01:56:30.435 --> 01:56:33.358]  And it's a good conduit to get with some of the other videos.
[01:56:34.739 --> 01:56:35.160]  I also
[01:56:35.922 --> 01:56:39.265]  I also think people should get the 9-11 eyewitness video.
[01:56:39.305 --> 01:56:40.305]  That's fantastic.
[01:56:41.146 --> 01:56:41.967]  Pretty powerful stuff.
[01:56:41.987 --> 01:56:43.748]  I think we're going to carry their new version of that.
[01:56:45.369 --> 01:56:46.410]  And one last comment.
[01:56:47.151 --> 01:56:49.252]  People really need to lay off Charlie Sheen.
[01:56:49.833 --> 01:56:52.535]  I don't care if he was a porn star or what.
[01:56:53.055 --> 01:56:56.578]  Anyone who is against what these guys are doing, they're my comrades.
[01:56:58.411 --> 01:56:59.652]  The new stuff is all made up.
[01:56:59.792 --> 01:57:01.133]  He was a young Hollywood guy.
[01:57:01.153 --> 01:57:02.654]  From the time he was 14, he was famous.
[01:57:03.014 --> 01:57:03.714]  What do you expect?
[01:57:03.774 --> 01:57:05.816]  I know him personally.
[01:57:05.836 --> 01:57:06.976]  I've spent days and days with him.
[01:57:07.016 --> 01:57:07.937]  I've stayed at his home before.
[01:57:08.577 --> 01:57:09.798]  The guy is completely straight-laced.
[01:57:09.818 --> 01:57:10.499]  He doesn't drink.
[01:57:11.399 --> 01:57:12.300]  He drinks coffee.
[01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:12.980]  That's it.
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:14.721]  He smokes a few cigarettes.
[01:57:17.223 --> 01:57:18.644]  He just studies the New World Order.
[01:57:19.124 --> 01:57:20.005]  He's very aware of it.
[01:57:20.791 --> 01:57:25.855]  Frankly, I've been with Charlie, okay, at times that then later in the news claims are made.
[01:57:25.995 --> 01:57:28.718]  I know stuff being said about him is lies.
[01:57:29.278 --> 01:57:31.440]  Alright, we'll be right back with the third hour.
[01:57:34.242 --> 01:57:38.486]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:50.231 --> 01:57:50.871]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.531 --> 01:57:52.612]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.312 --> 01:57:54.393]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.053 --> 01:57:55.873]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.634 --> 01:57:57.514]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.534 --> 01:58:01.936]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.376 --> 01:58:06.498]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.059 --> 01:58:10.580]  Dr. Wing-Wang Wong is scheduled to be joining us.
[01:58:10.620 --> 01:58:15.362]  We first interviewed her a couple months ago when she confronted there in the Rose Garden of the
[01:58:16.465 --> 01:58:19.647]  White House, Lloyd Bush, and of course the Chinese dictator.
[01:58:21.308 --> 01:58:26.771]  They had her grabbed, arrested, were charging her with the terrorism charge of the Patriot Act of intimidating a foreign official.
[01:58:27.332 --> 01:58:30.254]  They were forced to drop it, but she basically got a no contest.
[01:58:30.914 --> 01:58:37.258]  If she promises not to protest or stand up to any mass murderers anytime soon, then they won't prosecute her.
[01:58:38.259 --> 01:58:43.582]  But that is basically the government capitulating and admitting they have no case.
[01:58:44.713 --> 01:58:51.475]  See, they'd like to arrest us and throw away the key for five years for protesting, but they're not getting away with it quite yet, though they're trying.
[01:58:52.055 --> 01:58:59.277]  So as soon as we get Dr. Wing Wing Wong, who's a transplant doctor herself, exposing how they murder political dissidents and sell their organs, we will get her up.
[01:58:59.337 --> 01:59:00.157]  Do we have her yet?
[01:59:00.177 --> 01:59:04.479]  I know she's in transit, trying to get to a regular phone.
[01:59:04.499 --> 01:59:05.459]  She's on cell right now.
[01:59:05.559 --> 01:59:06.279]  Do you have her, John?
[01:59:08.220 --> 01:59:09.420]  We have Dr. Wing Wing Wong.
[01:59:09.920 --> 01:59:12.141]  Doctor, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[01:59:13.072 --> 01:59:14.753]  Oh, thank you for your invitation.
[01:59:15.333 --> 01:59:16.374]  You bet.
[01:59:16.674 --> 01:59:18.434]  They charged you under something that was very serious.
[01:59:18.454 --> 01:59:21.176]  You could have spent a lot of time in prison and a huge fine.
[01:59:21.236 --> 01:59:23.257]  Tell us the agreement that you've reached.
[01:59:23.297 --> 01:59:26.178]  I've got the Epoch Times, which I see on the street in L.A.
[01:59:26.218 --> 01:59:27.818]  and Toronto, wherever I go I see this.
[01:59:28.159 --> 01:59:30.380]  Pretty big paper you guys put out.
[01:59:30.440 --> 01:59:34.641]  Charges against Dr. Wang dropped is the headline.
[01:59:35.202 --> 01:59:35.782]  Tell us about it.
[01:59:36.604 --> 02:00:00.628]  Yes, just in April 20th, when I was in the White House, I was told actually, and there's no question and answer section, but like you know, at the time, there's been a very good reporting regarding the human rights situation in China, and all the news related to China and Asia.
[02:00:01.488 --> 02:00:10.393]  And so, at the beginning of this year, we actually had a big story reported that says organ harvest from live people.
[02:00:11.674 --> 02:00:14.715]  I've been with Epic Time for six years.
[02:00:15.175 --> 02:00:23.400]  Especially, I'm responsible for health-related issues because I, myself, as a physician, I graduated from the University of Chicago with
[02:00:24.033 --> 02:00:29.255]  Neuroscience and Pharmacology on the Physiology Program with PhD.
[02:00:29.735 --> 02:00:33.357]  Then I moved on to the UCSD in San Diego.
[02:00:33.377 --> 02:00:40.860]  I began my residency physician training for pathology, surgical pathology and cytology.
[02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:46.322]  I finished up last year with the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.
[02:00:47.168 --> 02:00:52.931]  And so when I report this news, I was just talking to my colleague and so many people.
[02:00:53.331 --> 02:01:02.435]  I cannot imagine why such crime has been continual for years.
[02:01:02.575 --> 02:01:05.197]  And then we act like the leader of the country is a good guy.
[02:01:05.237 --> 02:01:06.537]  No one should even be meeting with him.
[02:01:06.557 --> 02:01:07.558]  He's a filthy criminal.
[02:01:08.678 --> 02:01:11.159]  Right, and I was just so shocked.
[02:01:11.199 --> 02:01:14.481]  There's a silence in the international community.
[02:01:15.303 --> 02:01:16.704]  Well, silence!
[02:01:16.764 --> 02:01:18.926]  Silence when you know the truth is consent!
[02:01:19.826 --> 02:01:20.126]  Right?
[02:01:20.547 --> 02:01:34.656]  So, I just figured, because at that time, in March, we know, and because we exposed what was happening in China, then China, very fearful, they came out to deny, of course, everything.
[02:01:34.836 --> 02:01:39.619]  Like, they denied everything that happened in Tiananmen Square Massacre in July 1989.
[02:01:39.899 --> 02:01:40.620]  I'm not surprised.
[02:01:44.458 --> 02:01:52.784]  We know from third witness that that story we broke up is only at tip of the iceberg.
[02:01:52.984 --> 02:02:08.233]  Because they told our most shocking story, and about 36 labor camps present in China, all related with this organ removal and harvesting stories.
[02:02:09.214 --> 02:02:09.834]  36 hell centers?
[02:02:09.854 --> 02:02:10.675]  36 ghoul centers?
[02:02:14.662 --> 02:02:24.610]  And those centers, basically they have a practitioner follow going there, and they have their data bank of the tissue matching.
[02:02:24.730 --> 02:02:25.711]  Yeah, let's talk about that.
[02:02:25.971 --> 02:02:34.839]  Humans warehoused with data banks, political dissidents, waiting until a buyer who has the same tissue matched, not just blood type, is needed.
[02:02:34.959 --> 02:02:42.885]  And they are taken, kept alive while the organs are harvested, then they are sanguinated, their blood is sucked out, and they are killed.
[02:02:42.925 --> 02:02:43.486]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:46.716 --> 02:02:54.078]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:02:54.359 --> 02:02:59.100]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:04.962]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:03:05.202 --> 02:03:09.744]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:03:09.964 --> 02:03:17.106]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:03:17.126 --> 02:03:21.668]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.828 --> 02:03:24.349]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:03:24.569 --> 02:03:31.271]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[02:05:29.016 --> 02:05:29.536]  I think so.
[02:05:50.496 --> 02:05:51.137]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.817 --> 02:05:52.878]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.578 --> 02:05:54.759]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:55.339 --> 02:05:56.180]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.920 --> 02:05:57.761]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.461 --> 02:06:02.424]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.664 --> 02:06:06.787]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:07.467 --> 02:06:10.729]  Dr. Wang Wenyi Wong joins us.
[02:06:10.789 --> 02:06:16.293]  Dr. Wang Wenyi Wong, of course, is a doctor, medical doctor.
[02:06:16.954 --> 02:06:38.477]  Transplantee doctor amongst many other specialties specialities and she learned of how they have 36 camps for eyewitnesses and the Chinese government even advertises they have quote the blood type you need whenever you need it even then not just the blood type the specific tissue type which I'm told is even more advanced and specific so there's not as much organ rejection
[02:06:39.122 --> 02:06:52.770]  And then, when you're willing to pay your couple hundred thousand dollars for a heart or a liver, or eighty thousand dollars for a kidney, you just fly into China, and they even, in the Chinese translation, in some of these medical firms that advertise and do this for the government, that they are, quote, fresh organs.
[02:06:53.991 --> 02:06:59.093]  And that's all Washington Post, Associated Press, New York Times, the Wall Street Journal's done some good reports on it.
[02:06:59.133 --> 02:06:59.974]  It's all admitted!
[02:07:00.569 --> 02:07:05.091]  But then when Dr. Wang Yi Wong got up there and said, you know, you're going to be stopped.
[02:07:05.111 --> 02:07:06.012]  You're going to be exposed.
[02:07:06.032 --> 02:07:07.593]  Your days of doing this are numbered.
[02:07:08.113 --> 02:07:09.174]  You know, we're going to stop you.
[02:07:09.194 --> 02:07:10.114]  We're going to expose you.
[02:07:10.134 --> 02:07:11.875]  They tried to spin that into terrorism.
[02:07:12.355 --> 02:07:21.540]  Imagine the terrorist, Dr. Lady, has the courage to stand up with press passes at a press conference and tell President Bush and Chinese President that we're not going to put up with this.
[02:07:21.600 --> 02:07:23.261]  How she's bad!
[02:07:24.496 --> 02:07:30.842]  36 camps with humans like sides of beef kept alive in total torture with medical facilities right there in the building.
[02:07:31.262 --> 02:07:38.369]  And then when their number's up, just like something out of The Island, that science fiction movie that just came out, they go select you, they put you under...
[02:07:39.224 --> 02:07:45.310]  But I'm told they don't even put you under that deep because that might... We put the drug into the organs and we can't have that with our transplantee.
[02:07:45.810 --> 02:07:48.753]  And they keep you alive as they take the key organs, then they kill you.
[02:07:49.133 --> 02:07:51.516]  I'd like it from the doctor to get exactly how they do this.
[02:07:51.556 --> 02:07:58.202]  So she spoke out against it, and now the charges against Dr. Wang Yi Wong have been dropped.
[02:07:59.615 --> 02:08:09.161]  She's the one who protested during a welcome ceremony at the White House with Chinese leader Hu Jintao, if I pronounced that right, on April 20th, reached an agreement with prosecutors in which all charges will be dropped against her.
[02:08:09.241 --> 02:08:14.665]  She said on Wednesday, under the deal, charges against Wang will be postponed until April 2007.
[02:08:14.965 --> 02:08:21.109]  If she does not commit any crimes during that time period, including confronting foreign officials, the charges will then be dropped.
[02:08:21.787 --> 02:08:24.029]  Now, now, now, I don't like this agreement, though, okay?
[02:08:24.089 --> 02:08:25.369]  It should be dropped, period.
[02:08:25.690 --> 02:08:26.990]  They're setting this precedent.
[02:08:27.411 --> 02:08:32.154]  If you don't speak up and talk to and confront foreign officials, because that's a crime, see?
[02:08:32.374 --> 02:08:44.481]  They're saying if you don't commit any more crimes of free speech, of talking to, of yelling at murderers and telling them that we know they're murderers, to even say something that hardcore, that she won't be charged.
[02:08:44.501 --> 02:08:46.403]  If this was me, I'd say, throw the book at me, scum.
[02:08:46.423 --> 02:08:48.024]  We're going to make a big example out of this.
[02:08:48.584 --> 02:08:49.905]  I'm not agreeing to nothing!
[02:08:51.809 --> 02:08:57.253]  It's like don't, don't, don't, don't yell at John Wayne Gacy or Ted Bundy or Jeffrey Dahmer.
[02:08:57.533 --> 02:08:58.574]  Be nice to them.
[02:08:59.972 --> 02:09:03.755]  Dr. Wing Yi Wong, thank you again for joining us.
[02:09:04.595 --> 02:09:07.917]  Doctor, I want to get into your agreement, what happened that day, what they did when they grabbed you.
[02:09:08.438 --> 02:09:12.460]  And they tried to do it with Sidney Sheehan too, folks, wearing a t-shirt in the Congress, in the Capitol.
[02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:24.028]  This is happening more and more, but I want to go back specifically to these 36 torture centers, these hell pits, these human cattle rendering facilities.
[02:09:24.708 --> 02:09:28.831]  Tell us about what we know, and then tell us how they kill these people.
[02:09:30.271 --> 02:09:39.542]  And what we know is that the first two witnesses came to our newspaper, talked to us, including me, and told us this story like this.
[02:09:40.002 --> 02:09:43.446]  There are thousands and thousands of practitioners that follow Gong.
[02:09:43.967 --> 02:09:47.911]  They practice in meditation, exercise, you know, it's similar to Tai Chi.
[02:09:47.931 --> 02:09:48.272]  What is it?
[02:09:48.332 --> 02:09:49.633]  It's like a hundred million in China, right?
[02:09:51.650 --> 02:10:07.607]  A hundred million people practicing, and in the last 15 years, and it is a free charge, and so people just try to use this exercise to self-improve their well-being, physically and mentally, which is good for humankind.
[02:10:07.627 --> 02:10:09.449]  It's very simple.
[02:10:09.570 --> 02:10:12.653]  It's very similar to Hai Chi, right?
[02:10:13.652 --> 02:10:16.434]  Similar to Tai Chi, because it's very slow, actually.
[02:10:16.714 --> 02:10:19.936]  Very slow, elegant motion of exercise.
[02:10:19.956 --> 02:10:22.137]  When you do that, it's very gentle, actually.
[02:10:22.457 --> 02:10:29.782]  So that in China, people from the age of 3 or 4 to 95 years of age, they all can practice.
[02:10:29.802 --> 02:10:32.163]  It's so simple and easy to learn.
[02:10:32.463 --> 02:10:37.186]  So that's why in China, in 7 years, about 100 million people got involved in the practice.
[02:10:38.371 --> 02:10:43.513]  But you have to remember, China now is ruled by the Communist Party.
[02:10:43.873 --> 02:10:45.994]  They are ruling party and dictatorship.
[02:10:47.255 --> 02:10:48.795]  Murdering scum, yes.
[02:10:50.116 --> 02:11:03.882]  And especially when they see the people being empowered by the practice, being happy with themselves, being independent from ideology or communism, then they feel worried.
[02:11:04.022 --> 02:11:07.203]  Then they see this popularity as a potential threat to them.
[02:11:07.714 --> 02:11:09.955]  Those who don't know, you're a non-violent group.
[02:11:31.562 --> 02:11:41.565]  Right, and actually peace-loving and the innocent and non-violent group, but they just feel threatened.
[02:11:41.785 --> 02:11:48.707]  Like any spiritual group, like Tibetan people, they have a different culture of value.
[02:11:48.967 --> 02:11:51.088]  Or Christians, they have a different belief.
[02:11:51.428 --> 02:11:54.009]  Or Catholics, they have their own belief.
[02:11:54.029 --> 02:11:57.690]  Then the communists always feel threatened.
[02:11:57.710 --> 02:12:00.651]  So this time, they told this practitioner father-in-law, stop.
[02:12:01.226 --> 02:12:11.155]  But people, once they reach a certain status of, oh, I feel better when I'm practicing, I feel I need to continue.
[02:12:11.435 --> 02:12:16.679]  It's very similar to some Tibetan long life exercises.
[02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:20.643]  A lot of different Asian cultures have been doing this for thousands of years.
[02:12:20.703 --> 02:12:22.284]  It's really a stretching exercise.
[02:12:24.748 --> 02:12:25.809]  Right, very striking.
[02:12:25.849 --> 02:12:27.190]  When you see it, you love it.
[02:12:27.210 --> 02:12:31.473]  You're very curious why this is a threat to the Communist Party.
[02:12:31.493 --> 02:12:35.056]  You just cannot imagine how they reached that conclusion.
[02:12:35.537 --> 02:12:36.557]  But this happened.
[02:12:37.138 --> 02:12:45.224]  And the only thing, the problem with China is the Chinese Communist Party has a mentality, when they say something, you've got to listen.
[02:12:45.464 --> 02:12:48.647]  If you don't, then you will be punished.
[02:12:49.267 --> 02:12:52.670]  So when practitioner Falun Gong went to the central government to tell them,
[02:12:53.180 --> 02:12:55.521]  You guys made the wrong decision.
[02:12:55.761 --> 02:12:57.462]  We feel better with this practice.
[02:12:57.502 --> 02:12:59.623]  We want to stay with this practice.
[02:13:00.084 --> 02:13:06.027]  Then they feel so outraged that they feel you guys challenge their authority.
[02:13:06.627 --> 02:13:18.894]  The Communists always consider the controlling of people's minds and brainwash people that's violent and sometimes using violence against their own citizens.
[02:13:18.934 --> 02:13:20.995]  That's the way they can maintain their power.
[02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:26.162]  Now they see those people have a tendency to not listen to the Communist Party.
[02:13:26.543 --> 02:13:29.224]  Then they said, this has got to be stopped.
[02:13:29.384 --> 02:13:31.325]  Anyone continue, we'll put them in jail.
[02:13:31.765 --> 02:13:35.427]  So if your number had reached 100 million, what is it now after all the persecution?
[02:13:36.407 --> 02:13:41.470]  After the persecution, actually, the international community, more people get to know about the practice.
[02:13:41.510 --> 02:13:43.411]  There's a lot more practitioners.
[02:13:43.631 --> 02:13:48.233]  But inside, quite many, many millions of people got arrested.
[02:13:48.974 --> 02:13:53.617]  And so far we know that there are thousands and thousands of them in different labor camps.
[02:13:54.137 --> 02:14:05.385]  One of the camps in my hometown province, in Jilin province, northeast China, we know is jailed about 120,000 people.
[02:14:05.705 --> 02:14:07.906]  Most of them are Falun Gong practitioners.
[02:14:08.086 --> 02:14:09.247]  Is that from one province?
[02:14:10.048 --> 02:14:12.089]  That's from one province.
[02:14:12.109 --> 02:14:13.310]  120,000 from one province?
[02:14:13.930 --> 02:14:18.173]  Right, in Jilin province, very close to a Jiu Tai county.
[02:14:18.743 --> 02:14:25.746]  So, we know that so far, at least 36 labor camps, they killed a large number of practitioners of Falun Gong.
[02:14:26.446 --> 02:14:28.067]  Many numbers of them did not.
[02:14:28.627 --> 02:14:36.170]  How many people, let's say in the last year from your intel, have been killed at these extermination camps?
[02:14:36.570 --> 02:14:43.173]  According to Peter and Annie, the vigilance assistant who told us the story, in one facility,
[02:14:43.641 --> 02:14:50.505]  They report at least 4,000 people actually killed by the organ harvesting.
[02:14:50.545 --> 02:14:52.346]  Did you say 4,000?
[02:14:52.386 --> 02:14:52.346]  4,000.
[02:14:52.986 --> 02:15:03.772]  And basically using the minimum of the anesthesia, then give some of the medication which can slow down the heart.
[02:15:04.352 --> 02:15:06.413]  You have a circulation, you feel alive.
[02:15:06.843 --> 02:15:07.523]  Thank you very much.
[02:15:25.117 --> 02:15:27.859]  And it's $62,000 for kidney.
[02:15:28.159 --> 02:15:31.462]  That's right, they have the International Transplantation Center where they advertise the fresh organs.
[02:15:31.482 --> 02:15:32.102]  Yes, it's $62,000 for kidney, U.S.
[02:15:32.123 --> 02:15:33.023]  dollar, to $160,000 for heart.
[02:15:33.043 --> 02:15:38.267]  Then, in this country, myself as a physician, we know you need, because you need a blood type to be matched,
[02:15:52.631 --> 02:15:54.272]  And you need a tissue pack.
[02:15:54.592 --> 02:15:56.752]  That's why people have to wait and a lot of times die.
[02:15:56.772 --> 02:15:57.933]  But not if you buy it from China.
[02:15:57.973 --> 02:15:59.593]  They've got what you need immediately.
[02:16:00.174 --> 02:16:02.675]  No, you never can get it immediately in this country.
[02:16:02.695 --> 02:16:04.115]  You wait for years sometimes.
[02:16:04.575 --> 02:16:09.957]  But in China, this website, the advertising, we guarantee that we can give you an order within two weeks.
[02:16:10.237 --> 02:16:12.178]  Maximum will be four weeks.
[02:16:13.297 --> 02:16:14.978]  What that means, this is really a lot of data.
[02:16:14.998 --> 02:16:17.140]  That means they've got national DNA databases.
[02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:22.724]  Even if they don't have who they need, they can just check the records and find someone and then they can be arrested on charges.
[02:16:23.485 --> 02:16:24.065]  That's true.
[02:16:24.425 --> 02:16:25.846]  And that's really a worry.
[02:16:25.906 --> 02:16:26.727]  It concerns me.
[02:16:26.987 --> 02:16:29.169]  That's why we need a national DNA database here, folks.
[02:16:29.229 --> 02:16:32.912]  If David Rockefeller needs something, you've got a weird blood type, bye-bye.
[02:16:33.412 --> 02:16:34.273]  Bye-bye.
[02:16:34.313 --> 02:16:36.374]  Because the Homeland Security needs it.
[02:16:37.635 --> 02:16:42.499]  So the fact that this is something that's been going on for the last six years,
[02:16:43.110 --> 02:16:48.252]  And we just found out from the witness this year, March.
[02:16:48.752 --> 02:17:00.475]  So when we made a phone call, and immediately after we exposed this in international media by our paper, and China transferred the evidence very quickly.
[02:17:01.215 --> 02:17:07.497]  And we know the third witness, who is a veteran doctor in the military,
[02:17:08.781 --> 02:17:17.127]  So the Chinese military's doing it too?
[02:17:17.307 --> 02:17:19.748]  Right.
[02:17:19.828 --> 02:17:23.130]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[02:17:23.170 --> 02:17:24.351]  Final segment with our guest.
[02:17:24.371 --> 02:17:25.672]  She'll spend 10 more minutes with us, ma'am.

[02:19:45.945 --> 02:19:49.427]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.
[02:19:49.687 --> 02:19:53.189]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:19:53.289 --> 02:19:57.231]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:19:57.451 --> 02:20:03.614]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:20:04.015 --> 02:20:11.919]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:20:12.339 --> 02:20:17.682]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:20:17.842 --> 02:20:21.604]  Get the Black Berkey Filter Elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:20:21.964 --> 02:20:23.825]  And the Black Berkey Filters are reclaimable.
[02:20:23.885 --> 02:20:26.067]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.

[02:20:44.918 --> 02:20:48.961]  People who use Cartabite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:20:49.181 --> 02:20:52.563]  For over five years, Cartabite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:20:52.763 --> 02:20:56.166]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cartabite.
[02:20:56.491 --> 02:20:59.693]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:20:59.713 --> 02:21:05.216]  The basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we've seen.
[02:21:05.256 --> 02:21:14.881]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jogs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:21:15.021 --> 02:21:16.362]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[02:21:16.402 --> 02:21:21.805]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:21:22.290 --> 02:21:26.735]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:21:26.815 --> 02:21:28.176]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:21:28.356 --> 02:21:32.380]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.

[02:21:50.746 --> 02:21:52.668]  Waging War on Corruption.
[02:21:53.149 --> 02:21:55.932]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:56.372 --> 02:21:58.555]  Dr. Wang Wenyi Wong is our guest.
[02:21:58.575 --> 02:21:59.436]  Final segment with her.
[02:22:03.012 --> 02:22:18.396]  Dr. Shifting Gears, are you ever worried about the Chinese government trying to do something to you here domestically in the United States because you've been such a thorn in your side and have other Falun Gong practitioners gotten in trouble around the world because of Chinese government pressure?
[02:22:18.416 --> 02:22:20.696]  I know their government was pressuring the U.S.
[02:22:20.736 --> 02:22:22.997]  government to throw the book at you and they were throwing the book at you.
[02:22:23.017 --> 02:22:23.757]  Can you comment on that?
[02:22:29.025 --> 02:22:37.487]  The United States is a great country and they've been with the principle of freedom of speech and the assembly and the belief.
[02:22:37.907 --> 02:22:47.669]  But something, in the last few years, China has tried to do business with many countries, including the United States.
[02:22:49.469 --> 02:22:58.651]  Personally, I think for the Western society, with advocating the democracy principles,
[02:22:59.409 --> 02:23:05.955]  We have to be clear what kind of the nature of the communist regime.
[02:23:06.716 --> 02:23:14.363]  If they just commit such a crime against humanity, we cannot do business as usual without
[02:23:18.589 --> 02:23:20.550]  Our government and the U.N.
[02:23:20.570 --> 02:23:21.410]  and others agree with them.
[02:23:21.430 --> 02:23:23.671]  They give China awards for what they're doing.
[02:23:24.491 --> 02:23:25.371]  Has the pressure U.N.
[02:23:25.391 --> 02:23:27.812]  and others put on them, has that caused them to back off?
[02:23:27.832 --> 02:23:29.333]  Or are they trying to be more secretive now?
[02:23:29.353 --> 02:23:33.114]  I couldn't hear your question.
[02:23:34.714 --> 02:23:37.195]  Are they trying to cover up their death camps now?
[02:23:37.215 --> 02:23:38.395]  Are they trying to cover things up?
[02:23:38.435 --> 02:23:38.695]  Yes.
[02:23:39.096 --> 02:23:40.136]  Yes, of course.
[02:23:40.356 --> 02:23:47.138]  And actually, when we request the United States government to have an investigation into China,
[02:23:47.671 --> 02:23:52.593]  And they gave the guided tour to the American official.
[02:23:53.054 --> 02:24:03.399]  Then all the, like I said, the concentration camp, which incarcerated 4,000 people there and killed the people there, and they transferred all the evidence.
[02:24:03.419 --> 02:24:04.559]  One U.S.
[02:24:04.659 --> 02:24:09.862]  official there, and they couldn't find any evidence under the guided tour.
[02:24:10.362 --> 02:24:12.363]  Then we told the U.S.
[02:24:12.403 --> 02:24:13.864]  official, we need to ask
[02:24:14.710 --> 02:24:16.231]  Here's an analogy, here's an example.
[02:24:37.705 --> 02:24:48.756]  We know that if Iran had 36 death camps and had harvested 4,000 organs in the last year alone and were running ads about how they were fresh and good, that there'd be a military invasion of Iran to stop it.
[02:24:48.776 --> 02:24:50.457]  There'd be demands to investigate.
[02:24:50.818 --> 02:24:51.899]  But not when it's China.
[02:24:54.066 --> 02:25:00.911]  And I think at least we, the international community, need to demand such an investigation team.
[02:25:01.291 --> 02:25:06.415]  Because if you don't say anything, they just, in a dark place, they continue.
[02:25:06.455 --> 02:25:07.335]  There's no question.
[02:25:07.615 --> 02:25:14.180]  In fact, in the last two weeks, when we made a phone call to China, they still said, oh, we have a fresh organ.
[02:25:15.941 --> 02:25:21.325]  Yeah, we know it's ongoing and our elite is all for it.
[02:25:21.345 --> 02:25:22.226]  They're a bunch of sickos.
[02:25:22.246 --> 02:25:24.588]  They call us human cattle, human resources.
[02:25:24.648 --> 02:25:25.769]  The terms are used publicly.
[02:25:26.109 --> 02:25:28.431]  Two final questions for you, Doctor.
[02:25:28.471 --> 02:25:33.375]  We appreciate you checking in with us today and we're glad that you aren't going to prison, but at the same time,
[02:25:33.975 --> 02:25:41.481]  They say here in the news articles that I've seen on this, both in your paper and in mainstream papers, that you've done a further judification or no contest.
[02:25:41.521 --> 02:25:46.424]  You quote, agree to not, quote, commit the crime of confronting foreign leaders again.
[02:25:46.965 --> 02:25:50.207]  Confronting foreign leaders on their crimes is not a crime.
[02:25:50.627 --> 02:25:53.309]  So our government is openly saying this is a crime.
[02:25:53.369 --> 02:25:54.390]  Why did you agree to this?
[02:25:56.011 --> 02:25:58.973]  I talked, because they put the charge on me.
[02:25:59.374 --> 02:26:01.955]  I really told the last time in the 14th,
[02:26:03.166 --> 02:26:08.429]  And 31st of May, I told them I'd like to move on trial.
[02:26:09.109 --> 02:26:09.790]  But the U.S.
[02:26:09.870 --> 02:26:15.573]  side attorney didn't want that, and they want to see the case dismissed.
[02:26:16.113 --> 02:26:22.437]  But at the same time, I demand that this case, if they want to... I agree!
[02:26:22.477 --> 02:26:25.038]  So basically, you're agreeing here that...
[02:26:27.472 --> 02:26:32.241]  But they did not agree to remove the condition like a year ago.
[02:26:32.402 --> 02:26:34.586]  You should have, I mean, look you've done enough.
[02:26:34.606 --> 02:26:37.392]  I'm not saying you're bad, but you could have just said no.
[02:26:37.412 --> 02:26:38.714]  I mean, you don't have to agree with the U.S.
[02:26:38.754 --> 02:26:39.055]  Attorney.
[02:26:40.146 --> 02:26:45.969]  Then I finally figured, because I have so many immediate things I need to do.
[02:26:46.189 --> 02:26:50.231]  I know, you think you can do more good by being outside of court.
[02:26:50.251 --> 02:26:50.711]  You just ended.
[02:26:50.731 --> 02:26:51.312]  I understand.
[02:26:51.332 --> 02:27:02.597]  Right, and that means I don't give a commitment that I want to do it again, because even if they continue such a crime, definitely I will speak out the same thing.
[02:27:02.757 --> 02:27:03.578]  So hold on, Doctor.
[02:27:03.618 --> 02:27:06.799]  Doctor, you're saying if you get a chance to confront the Chinese President, you'll do it again?
[02:27:07.700 --> 02:27:08.040]  Of course.
[02:27:08.800 --> 02:27:10.181]  If they continue such a crime.
[02:27:11.041 --> 02:27:11.922]  Well, good job.
[02:27:12.722 --> 02:27:16.564]  Tell us about a website where we can learn more about the organ harvesting.
[02:27:17.204 --> 02:27:18.165]  Yes, indeed.
[02:27:18.345 --> 02:27:19.946]  Foreigninfo.net.
[02:27:21.066 --> 02:27:25.269]  F-A-L-U-N-F-O-R-I-N-F-O-N-E-T.
[02:27:25.529 --> 02:27:28.310]  Alright, we'll get links to it up on the website, Doctor.
[02:27:28.590 --> 02:27:29.811]  Thank you for spending time with us.
[02:27:30.551 --> 02:27:32.172]  Yes, thank you so much for your invitation.
[02:27:32.452 --> 02:27:32.973]  God bless you.
[02:27:33.013 --> 02:27:33.413]  Bye-bye.
[02:27:33.613 --> 02:27:34.233]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:36.326 --> 02:27:39.308]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.249 --> 02:27:42.931]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.281 --> 02:27:50.704]  Local folklore has recognized its amazing medicinal properties for thousands of years.
[02:27:50.864 --> 02:27:56.548]  But no one knew just how to preserve the nutritional benefits and market the total fruit commercially until Zango, that is.
[02:27:56.908 --> 02:28:01.832]  Zango is made from mangosteen, a fruit that grows in the subtropical climates of Southeast Asia.
[02:28:02.072 --> 02:28:06.575]  It contains anthones, the highest concentration of antioxidants found in nature.
[02:28:06.875 --> 02:28:13.157]  Modern science is only just beginning to unlock the many secrets of Xantho and their far-reaching potential to improve our health.
[02:28:13.457 --> 02:28:14.997]  Xango is revolutionary.
[02:28:15.197 --> 02:28:25.200]  Not only has Xango taken the world by storm as an extremely potent functional health beverage, but Xango has become the most exciting and fastest growing home-based business opportunity ever.
[02:28:25.500 --> 02:28:27.661]  Life is short and timing is everything.
[02:28:28.001 --> 02:28:29.623]  Unleash the power of Zango today!
[02:28:29.843 --> 02:28:31.185]  Find out more by calling 888-203-6633.
[02:28:31.205 --> 02:28:32.046]  That's 888-203-6633.
[02:28:32.146 --> 02:28:33.848]  Or visit www.MangosteenMarket.com.
[02:28:33.988 --> 02:28:35.309]  That's M-A-N-G-O-S-T-E-E-N Market.com.
[02:28:45.777 --> 02:28:48.778]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:28:49.098 --> 02:28:54.020]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:28:54.280 --> 02:28:58.641]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:28:58.922 --> 02:29:07.845]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:29:08.045 --> 02:29:11.666]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:29:11.966 --> 02:29:16.988]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:29:17.289 --> 02:29:23.992]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:29:24.494 --> 02:29:25.135]  What about you?
[02:29:25.795 --> 02:29:31.159]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:29:47.917 --> 02:29:50.018]  Hey Bill, I'm buying lunch today.
[02:29:50.338 --> 02:29:52.379]  And check this out, I bought a new car.
[02:29:52.459 --> 02:29:57.680]  Wow John, I guess you took my advice and visited that website we were talking about over lunch last time we met.
[02:29:58.260 --> 02:30:02.382]  www.DidYouRobBillGates.com I did, and you were right.
[02:30:02.722 --> 02:30:07.623]  I learned how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[02:30:08.044 --> 02:30:10.504]  And it's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[02:30:10.804 --> 02:30:14.146]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my fifth week.
[02:30:14.386 --> 02:30:15.286]  Whoa, that's awesome!
[02:30:15.646 --> 02:30:18.047]  John, your business will keep growing as mine has.
[02:30:18.387 --> 02:30:20.628]  In fact, people are joining from all over the world.
[02:30:20.748 --> 02:30:21.408]  It's incredible!
[02:30:21.788 --> 02:30:29.250]  Everyone should go to www.DidYouRobBillGates.com and learn how this program can help them become financially independent, too.
[02:30:29.591 --> 02:30:34.512]  Thanks a million, Bill, for telling me about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:30:35.132 --> 02:30:35.832]  Check, please!
[02:30:36.273 --> 02:30:37.173]  I got this one, Bill.
[02:30:37.553 --> 02:30:38.253]  Sure, John.
[02:30:38.393 --> 02:30:42.995]  Let's tell everyone about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:30:43.135 --> 02:30:43.375]  Deal.
[02:30:48.680 --> 02:30:58.909]  Alright, I've got this piece put together from Jon Stewart.
[02:30:59.729 --> 02:31:02.191]  There's one little racy part.
[02:31:02.211 --> 02:31:03.833]  Did you fully excise that, Jon?
[02:31:07.096 --> 02:31:07.716]  Okay, great.
[02:31:09.498 --> 02:31:12.240]  Jon Stewart talking about the bust.
[02:31:13.834 --> 02:31:17.835]  And they've got the FBI guy up there, the local director, and they've got Alberto Gonzalez.
[02:31:17.855 --> 02:31:19.015]  I mean, it's just such a joke.
[02:31:19.435 --> 02:31:31.457]  So I wanted to, before we went to call, talk about fake terror alerts, fake provocateur patsies they bust, to give the illusion that there's this big terror threat, an army, a ground war, we're under great threat.
[02:31:32.618 --> 02:31:39.399]  And I got up Thursday morning at the hotel room in LA, I guess about 6 o'clock in the morning out there,
[02:31:40.985 --> 02:31:49.991]  And I turn on the news, and I'm laying there in the bed, trying to wake up, and I hear, coming up next, major terror cell busted in Florida, 20 plus people.
[02:31:50.291 --> 02:32:07.622]  Later, by that day, it was 17, and then 7, and then... And then it went to break, and I got up, started making some coffee, and I thought, okay, it'll be young kids, teenagers, probably homeless people, there'll probably be some folks that are mentally retarded on welfare, it's always the same.
[02:32:08.647 --> 02:32:15.274]  And they probably delivered them fertilizer, or they probably had FBI or informants leading the group.
[02:32:17.557 --> 02:32:18.698]  And how did I know that?
[02:32:19.819 --> 02:32:25.145]  I mean, I'm sitting there mumbling this to myself, going, oh my gosh, hobbling around up there in the hotel room.
[02:32:25.185 --> 02:32:28.549]  Because I've been up until about 2 in the morning in preparation for the conference.
[02:32:29.557 --> 02:32:58.705]  And then, boom, CNN comes back on, and there's the press conferences and all of it, and they had no weapons, they had no nothing, a bunch of them were low-grade morons on welfare, some of them, you know, had been runaways, the youngest was 16, the oldest 25, and they were, quote, Christian group, they were not Muslim, and the FBI came in, became the leaders of the group, bought them camo, bought them shoes, got them a little warehouse space,
[02:33:00.074 --> 02:33:02.676]  Would give them $50,000 here, $10,000 there.
[02:33:02.756 --> 02:33:07.300]  Told them to take video cameras and videotape the FBI building there in Florida.
[02:33:07.861 --> 02:33:09.422]  Told them they'd get more money if they did it.
[02:33:09.442 --> 02:33:13.705]  These young kids are told they're Christian soldiers fighting the New World Order.
[02:33:13.745 --> 02:33:14.926]  They're doing all this stuff.
[02:33:14.986 --> 02:33:20.251]  They're going to... They need to take an allegiance to Al-Qaeda.
[02:33:20.291 --> 02:33:21.912]  They get one of them to do that.
[02:33:23.273 --> 02:33:24.715]  And they talk to the neighbors.
[02:33:24.895 --> 02:33:27.417]  I mean, these are literal complete morons.
[02:33:28.582 --> 02:33:30.043]  Same story in Canada.
[02:33:31.543 --> 02:33:38.347]  For a full year in Florida, full year in Canada, they had informants, they had agents in there trying to provocateur them.
[02:33:39.067 --> 02:33:40.808]  Trying to get them to talk about violence.
[02:33:42.949 --> 02:33:44.970]  Trying to get them to talk about it on video tape.
[02:33:46.230 --> 02:33:55.815]  And I made the point in my speech in California, that on one of my two speeches I gave, I gave one on Saturday, one on Sunday,
[02:33:56.810 --> 02:33:58.892]  That we're going to post this on the website for free.
[02:33:58.912 --> 02:34:00.353]  We're going to play it on the radio show tomorrow.
[02:34:02.655 --> 02:34:16.826]  I made the point that I could go out right now, forget $50,000, with a couple thousand dollars, I could go pick up with a van 10 homeless people.
[02:34:17.987 --> 02:34:19.068]  I could take them to a bar.
[02:34:19.148 --> 02:34:20.309]  I could get them totally drunk.
[02:34:22.975 --> 02:34:24.696]  This is basically the quick way to provocateur.
[02:34:24.736 --> 02:34:52.450]  But so the feds wouldn't bust me and claim I was planning some real terrorist attack, I'd have literature, I'd say, we are the brigade of, and I'd use some weird religious name, and we know there's about to be a Martian invasion, and so I have built a flying saucer, and you guys get paid $500 a piece if you agree to dress up in camouflage, let me videotape it, and really this van is a flying saucer, and we're going to fly to Mars,
[02:34:53.297 --> 02:35:00.659]  And we're going to battle the Martians, and I'll give them all plastic little machine guns, the type you pull the trigger and sparks come out the front, the type I had when I was a kid and loved.
[02:35:00.719 --> 02:35:01.619]  I'm going to go buy some.
[02:35:01.879 --> 02:35:02.639]  I'm thinking about doing this.
[02:35:02.999 --> 02:35:17.603]  Then we'll all get in the van, and we'll all just, uh, we'll get them all on video, we'll all imagine that we fly to Mars, and then I'm going to have them all sign waivers, it was basically a film project, at the end of it, so I can air it and won't get sued.
[02:35:18.123 --> 02:35:20.784]  I mean, really, when I get time, I'm going to do this because I'm sick!
[02:35:21.750 --> 02:35:34.895]  It took them a year, and the first payment was $50,000, now we're learning there were all these other payments, to basically go get a bunch of street kids and convince them to go along with this and do all this.
[02:35:35.956 --> 02:35:39.577]  And then even the FBI and others had to admit that they were no threat, it wasn't real.
[02:35:41.158 --> 02:35:46.160]  This was a total provocative action, and I've dealt with this over and over again in my life.
[02:35:48.985 --> 02:35:57.787]  I mean, maybe one out of five that comes up to me saying they want to do violence or let's do something together in the Fed or some local, you know, DPS intelligence officer.
[02:35:58.287 --> 02:36:04.789]  But other cases, we've gotten their license numbers and run who they are and their DPS intelligence or their local APD intelligence.
[02:36:05.789 --> 02:36:06.629]  We've confronted them.
[02:36:08.410 --> 02:36:11.450]  Some of the anarchist leaders here locally, we've confirmed are on the cop payroll.
[02:36:14.971 --> 02:36:17.492]  And we ran into this up in
[02:36:18.780 --> 02:36:20.421]  Up in Canada at the Bilderberg Group.
[02:36:21.902 --> 02:36:26.364]  And if I would have said, yeah, let's do something violent, folks, I would have been swarmed, arrested.
[02:36:26.824 --> 02:36:36.689]  The provocateurs got a local engineer, a local electrical engineer, we had him on the show, to just vaguely talk about
[02:36:37.523 --> 02:36:40.685]  You know, building 7 and buildings coming down and the law of physics worked.
[02:36:40.705 --> 02:36:41.425]  Those guys are evil.
[02:36:41.465 --> 02:36:42.386]  Those buildings would come down.
[02:36:42.706 --> 02:36:44.387]  They arrested them, took them in, interrogated them.
[02:36:44.407 --> 02:36:46.268]  I mean, these people were all around me.
[02:36:46.288 --> 02:36:47.568]  You understand, I live with this.
[02:36:47.648 --> 02:36:48.429]  I understand this.
[02:36:48.489 --> 02:36:50.450]  But I'm not a low-grade moron.
[02:36:50.470 --> 02:36:54.632]  I'm not that smart, but I'm a... And I gotta be, you know, really careful about this type of stuff.
[02:36:54.652 --> 02:36:55.813]  And there's all sorts of setups.
[02:36:55.893 --> 02:37:03.517]  I was a... Speaking of the devil, I was at the hotel, you know, and there at night, going to the bar, they got hamburgers and stuff.
[02:37:04.501 --> 02:37:07.983]  And there was also the National Porn Convention going on in downtown L.A.
[02:37:08.003 --> 02:37:10.364]  at the same time, so Janet Jameson was in the bar.
[02:37:10.744 --> 02:37:13.886]  This could have been a weirder scene, but they're in the bar restaurant of the hotel.
[02:37:13.906 --> 02:37:21.230]  And I go sit down, and these two young ladies come over, and they sit down, and I was wondering what it was, and people started snapping pictures.
[02:37:21.250 --> 02:37:25.933]  You know, it's all these types of setups I deal with, the type of stuff I live with day-to-day.
[02:37:27.153 --> 02:37:28.714]  So I've gotten pretty wise to all this.
[02:37:29.655 --> 02:37:32.116]  Anthony Hilder, of all people, noticed it too, and told me I should get out of there.
[02:37:33.615 --> 02:37:35.535]  Then Rob drank something.
[02:37:36.436 --> 02:37:37.996]  One drink and had to go to the hospital.
[02:37:38.056 --> 02:37:41.237]  Yes, one of our people here, the opposite, had to go to the L.A.
[02:37:41.297 --> 02:37:42.237]  downtown hospital.
[02:37:42.257 --> 02:37:43.777]  Let me tell you, that was a lot of fun.
[02:37:44.777 --> 02:37:49.558]  So, a lot of weird stuff going on, but I think they may have put something in his drink.
[02:37:50.218 --> 02:37:53.319]  But, side issue, not those particular, but other people.
[02:37:54.859 --> 02:38:01.721]  So, all this stuff's going on, all this stuff is happening, and so I deal with it.
[02:38:01.761 --> 02:38:02.661]  I deal with it a lot.
[02:38:04.437 --> 02:38:07.678]  There were a few people at the conference coming up who were just obviously cops.
[02:38:07.698 --> 02:38:08.838]  One of them was obviously a cop.
[02:38:08.858 --> 02:38:10.819]  The other one was obviously an informant.
[02:38:10.839 --> 02:38:12.299]  They have these little crooks that do this.
[02:38:12.319 --> 02:38:15.000]  They usually have a rap sheet a hundred yards long and it's what they do.
[02:38:16.380 --> 02:38:20.982]  But they don't just bust you normally Canada would have right when you first shoot your mouth off.
[02:38:23.883 --> 02:38:25.023]  They get a boost in funding.
[02:38:25.063 --> 02:38:31.925]  Normally the informant or the agent is getting a small bit of funding for it but as soon as it goes hot
[02:38:32.461 --> 02:38:42.784]  Where as soon as they have you saying something violent, they then get hazard pay, hazard duty, they get more officers assigned, so their pay grade gets bumped up while it's happening.
[02:38:43.344 --> 02:38:51.287]  And a lot of times when they're provocateuring, it's just to surveil you and to get money and to be able to lazily sit around listening to your phone conversations for the next eight months.
[02:38:51.947 --> 02:38:53.887]  These people are the lazy scum of the earth.
[02:38:55.568 --> 02:38:56.188]  They really are.
[02:38:56.963 --> 02:39:06.707]  They wanted to stop terrorists, they should go surveil the Carlyle Group, but that'll never happen, because the government uses the NSA to make sure that other agencies with good agents aren't able to do their job.
[02:39:07.988 --> 02:39:18.692]  And then if you're a colonel in Defense Intelligence and you're trying to stop 9-11, they just tell you to shut up, and next thing, start charging you for $65 in phone calls on your government cell phone to your wife.
[02:39:20.873 --> 02:39:24.695]  And the Supreme Court's ruled, no whistleblowing, you're not allowed to, and there's no more freedom.
[02:39:26.551 --> 02:39:27.672]  Oh, you can't protest.
[02:39:27.833 --> 02:39:29.014]  Oh, you can't whistle-blow.
[02:39:29.254 --> 02:39:35.461]  Oh, we're going to start arresting reporters that leak classified info that shows government corruption, because the government says it's classified.
[02:39:35.481 --> 02:39:38.785]  So this is what we deal with.
[02:39:38.885 --> 02:39:46.114]  So, here's this Jon Stewart piece, and I just got to play, where he talks about how dumb, he calls them basically dumbbells,
[02:39:46.984 --> 02:39:48.686]  Uh, and it's always the same MO.
[02:39:48.726 --> 02:39:55.312]  The two guys that bombed the World Trade Center the first time, both on welfare, registered with the City of New York as being mentally retarded.
[02:39:55.332 --> 02:39:57.634]  75 and 76 IQs.
[02:39:57.714 --> 02:39:59.216]  One had 75 and one had like 80.
[02:39:59.696 --> 02:40:01.538]  So one's a low-grade moron, the other's retarded.
[02:40:03.211 --> 02:40:15.893]  They cook the bomb, train the driver, they do it in a little mosque with a pizza place with thirty-something members where the imam is blind so he can't see all this happening and he is a loudmouth imam shooting his mouth off about killing the infidels.
[02:40:15.913 --> 02:40:17.654]  So it's a perfect setup for them.
[02:40:17.674 --> 02:40:20.054]  They find a mosque with a bunch of idiots in it and they do the same thing.
[02:40:20.674 --> 02:40:21.575]  You can always find that.
[02:40:23.555 --> 02:40:28.196]  And they give them the bombs and they tell the informant, the Egyptian security agent who worked with the CIA,
[02:40:30.734 --> 02:40:31.654]  Well, you know the story.
[02:40:31.674 --> 02:40:35.855]  They tell him, we're just building a real bomb and giving him real detonators so we can get him here for more time in prison.
[02:40:37.075 --> 02:40:38.555]  Three days before, he's built the bomb.
[02:40:38.595 --> 02:40:39.676]  He goes, listen, we've got to bust them.
[02:40:39.696 --> 02:40:40.516]  They're in the warehouse.
[02:40:41.196 --> 02:40:42.036]  This is going to happen.
[02:40:42.396 --> 02:40:43.756]  The little rented warehouse space.
[02:40:46.137 --> 02:40:47.357]  We've got to go in against them.
[02:40:48.397 --> 02:40:49.857]  And they say, nope, we're pulling you off the case.
[02:40:49.877 --> 02:40:50.637]  We're not going to bust them.
[02:40:50.938 --> 02:40:54.958]  He freaks out, knows they're setting him up, which they do all the time.
[02:40:55.058 --> 02:40:59.439]  And so he goes and records over 10 hours of the FBI head in New York saying, we're going to let this go ahead.
[02:41:00.168 --> 02:41:00.508]  We're good to go.
[02:41:19.036 --> 02:41:20.377]  So it's the same thing.
[02:41:20.397 --> 02:41:22.499]  And it's scary, folks.
[02:41:22.539 --> 02:41:25.141]  I mean, they could easily deliver ammonium nitrate to my office.
[02:41:25.761 --> 02:41:27.943]  One of my employees walks out and they go, deliver it for Alex Jones.
[02:41:27.963 --> 02:41:28.543]  They sign it.
[02:41:28.844 --> 02:41:31.906]  The minute your employee signs, five vans pull up.
[02:41:32.486 --> 02:41:33.907]  Men with MP5s jump out.
[02:41:33.947 --> 02:41:45.196]  They come, bounce on your head in the concrete, drag you off to prison, and sure, three months later it comes out you were totally innocent, just like it just did in London from a month ago, but by then it's the back of the paper and Dumbbell America doesn't know it.
[02:41:45.945 --> 02:41:46.906]  All right, I said I'd take calls.
[02:41:46.926 --> 02:41:48.988]  We will jam in a whole raft of them here in a minute.
[02:41:49.288 --> 02:41:56.594]  But first off, here is Jon Stewart talking about this with some clips from the FBI and Alberto, Bush is above the law, Gonzalez.
[02:41:56.654 --> 02:41:57.134]  Here it is.
[02:41:57.795 --> 02:42:05.702]  As been reported, seven men were arrested yesterday in Miami on charges of conspiring to support the Al Qaeda terrorist organization.
[02:42:05.882 --> 02:42:11.326]  These individuals wish to wage a, quote, full ground war against the United States.
[02:42:12.487 --> 02:42:13.068]  Seven guys?
[02:42:17.456 --> 02:42:19.278]  I am not a general.
[02:42:20.038 --> 02:42:23.201]  I am not in any way affiliated with the Military Academy.
[02:42:23.981 --> 02:42:33.308]  But I believe if you are going to wage a full ground war against the United States, you need to field at least as many people as, say, a softball team.
[02:42:33.429 --> 02:42:36.871]  Nevertheless!
[02:42:37.572 --> 02:42:39.573]  Nevertheless!
[02:42:39.633 --> 02:42:43.917]  How about that new terror tracking FBI?
[02:42:44.989 --> 02:42:50.111]  Unfortunately, because of the fine work of law enforcement, these men were unable to advance their deadly plot.
[02:42:50.871 --> 02:42:58.593]  A dreadful potential catastrophe averted, and clearly, the government wouldn't bother to hold a press conference if this were NOT a major step in the war on terror.
[02:42:58.813 --> 02:42:59.013]  Right?
[02:42:59.213 --> 02:43:01.874]  Alright, so goodnight everybody, and oh, I'm sorry, uh, questions.
[02:43:02.694 --> 02:43:09.056]  Do the, uh, uh, uh, men have any actual contact with any members of Al Qaeda that you know of?
[02:43:10.737 --> 02:43:10.917]  Any...
[02:43:13.210 --> 02:43:15.252]  The answer to that is no.
[02:43:17.534 --> 02:43:19.756]  Did you find any explosives, weapons?
[02:43:20.036 --> 02:43:22.218]  And you raise a good point.
[02:43:26.783 --> 02:43:27.824]  You do raise a good point.
[02:43:28.364 --> 02:43:35.130]  That point being that these deadly international terrorists had very slyly disguised themselves as a bunch of dicks living in a warehouse.
[02:43:37.172 --> 02:43:38.753]  They're cunning, they fly.
[02:43:40.491 --> 02:43:51.497]  As for the alleged... As for the plot... Was there anything against the Sears Tower, except this one apparent... just kind of a mention of the Sears Tower?
[02:43:51.517 --> 02:44:01.563]  It doesn't look like they have pictures, or... The only individuals who was familiar with the Sears Tower had worked in Chicago and had been there, so was familiar with the Tower.
[02:44:02.444 --> 02:44:06.606]  But in terms of the plans, it was more aspirational than operational.
[02:44:07.515 --> 02:44:12.758]  No weapons, no actual contact with Al-Qaeda, but one of them had been to Chicago.
[02:44:15.359 --> 02:44:18.341]  By that standard, I believe this may be a terror cell.
[02:44:18.441 --> 02:44:25.225]  Oh, and one other thing about this Al-Qaeda sleeper cell you should know.
[02:44:26.145 --> 02:44:27.946]  We study and we train through the Bible.
[02:44:28.546 --> 02:44:28.826]  What?
[02:44:30.620 --> 02:44:31.601]  Misinterpreting the Bible!
[02:44:31.641 --> 02:44:32.161]  That's our job!
[02:44:32.241 --> 02:44:34.203]  Wait a minute, these guys aren't even Muslims!
[02:44:34.483 --> 02:44:37.966]  In fact, I think even they're confused about what they are!
[02:44:38.466 --> 02:44:41.668]  But there were connections to other members of this group in Chicago?
[02:44:42.469 --> 02:44:43.990]  Yes, we have soldiers in Chicago.
[02:44:44.430 --> 02:44:45.952]  Why do you call yourselves soldiers?
[02:44:46.732 --> 02:44:50.395]  What's the, you know, if it's a peaceful group, why use the term soldier?
[02:44:50.755 --> 02:44:54.158]  Because we study and we train through the Bible, not only physical.
[02:44:55.319 --> 02:44:56.580]  Not only physical, but mentally.
[02:44:57.800 --> 02:44:58.161]  Did he...
[02:44:58.948 --> 02:45:06.470]  Did he really just say, not only physical, but also mental?
[02:45:08.810 --> 02:45:11.651]  So apparently studying the Bible is what makes a soldier.
[02:45:11.991 --> 02:45:17.292]  I guess like Sergeant Desmond Tutu or Lieutenant Colonel the Pope.
[02:45:19.352 --> 02:45:20.592]  Still, what's the harm?
[02:45:21.032 --> 02:45:27.294]  What's the harm in hyping a terrorist thing, even if it turns out to really be nothing at all?
[02:45:27.794 --> 02:45:28.634]  Who does it really hurt?
[02:45:29.994 --> 02:45:32.956]  I was scared because I worked Kitty Corner from Sears Tower.
[02:45:33.417 --> 02:45:35.539]  And I was working on that September 11th.
[02:45:35.959 --> 02:45:38.721]  I was just leaving work when that all happened.
[02:45:40.122 --> 02:45:42.885]  And I felt, I started feeling like things were okay.
[02:45:43.705 --> 02:45:45.126]  Now I'm scared.
[02:45:45.166 --> 02:45:45.367]  Again.
[02:45:45.627 --> 02:45:46.888]  And I don't know.
[02:45:47.348 --> 02:45:49.870]  To which the government responded, ahem.
[02:45:53.113 --> 02:45:53.493]  All right.
[02:45:55.095 --> 02:45:55.695]  Unbelievable.
[02:45:55.975 --> 02:45:57.396]  Bill and Baltimore, you're on the air.
[02:45:57.456 --> 02:45:57.937]  Go ahead, Bill.
[02:46:00.529 --> 02:46:01.150]  It's all a big joke.
[02:46:02.691 --> 02:46:03.492]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:46:03.512 --> 02:46:04.633]  I said it's all a big joke.
[02:46:04.833 --> 02:46:06.575]  Yes, it is a big joke.
[02:46:06.795 --> 02:46:08.396]  Who owns that Sears Tower?
[02:46:08.957 --> 02:46:09.818]  Larry Silverstein.
[02:46:11.259 --> 02:46:13.221]  Sears doesn't own it, huh?
[02:46:13.281 --> 02:46:19.366]  No, Larry Silverstein a year and a half ago bought the Sears Tower, the same guy that owned the World Trade Center Complex.
[02:46:20.207 --> 02:46:22.129]  Who cleaned up the mess after
[02:46:23.291 --> 02:46:24.871]  9-11 at the Trade Center.
[02:46:24.911 --> 02:46:30.332]  Controlled Demolition Incorporated, the same ones that quote, cleaned up the mess at the Oklahoma City bombing.
[02:46:30.953 --> 02:46:31.853]  They're based in Maryland.
[02:46:31.913 --> 02:46:35.113]  I should go out and peek around some day and see what they do, huh?
[02:46:36.374 --> 02:46:38.554]  They're very nice, good people, yes.
[02:46:38.954 --> 02:46:41.815]  Don't they usually demolish buildings in like Las Vegas and stuff?
[02:46:42.275 --> 02:46:46.196]  Yeah, they're the world premier organization company for that.
[02:46:46.696 --> 02:46:48.356]  They do an excellent job.
[02:46:48.376 --> 02:46:52.897]  Do you think they're conditioning us to maybe be accepting of
[02:46:54.113 --> 02:46:56.954]  This stupid scenario if it happens again with the Sears Tower?
[02:46:58.294 --> 02:47:00.535]  Yes sir, I agree with you.
[02:47:00.595 --> 02:47:01.495]  Thanks for the call.
[02:47:02.335 --> 02:47:04.916]  Let me just tell you some of the good news of the conference.
[02:47:05.976 --> 02:47:16.819]  I get there and the waitstaff, the people at the bar, I'd say about 30% of the people I talked to at the hotel were already fans and aware of what we do.
[02:47:17.947 --> 02:47:20.453]  I saw two LAPD cops were in the building.
[02:47:20.593 --> 02:47:22.999]  They both, I talked to them, knew what was going on and agreed with me.
[02:47:23.019 --> 02:47:25.444]  I mean, imagine cops knowing, yes, we agree with you.
[02:47:26.292 --> 02:47:33.720]  There were some particular undercover LAPD cops there that were providing security for some of the VIPs and bodyguards who also were police.
[02:47:36.102 --> 02:47:39.806]  The real bodyguards aren't shaved head muscle guys, they're guys in suits, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:47:40.186 --> 02:47:47.573]  They all enjoyed the conference and agreed and said that, oh quote, we all know on the force, yes we all know, yes we're not stupid, we know the government did 9-11.
[02:47:48.590 --> 02:47:50.331]  So it was just cops everywhere saying that.
[02:47:51.492 --> 02:47:55.735]  It was, you know, knock-knock, maid service, Hispanic lady at the door.
[02:47:56.115 --> 02:47:57.156]  Oh, Alex Jones, hi.
[02:47:57.956 --> 02:47:59.137]  My son is a fan.
[02:47:59.577 --> 02:48:00.538]  Visit your website.
[02:48:00.558 --> 02:48:02.239]  You know, some 50-year-old Hispanic lady.
[02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:04.341]  On and on and on.
[02:48:04.421 --> 02:48:06.982]  So government, I mean, people in the airport.
[02:48:07.683 --> 02:48:09.924]  And I don't mean I'm walking past a crowd and somebody runs over.
[02:48:09.964 --> 02:48:10.585]  That happened, too.
[02:48:11.045 --> 02:48:18.350]  I mean, I run into Chili's to get something to eat at the airport, and both people I sit down between, totally separate groups are, oh, Alex Jones, instantly.
[02:48:19.108 --> 02:48:23.429]  I mean, and I use that as a yardstick of how much effect we're having.
[02:48:24.029 --> 02:48:25.009]  I'm like, did you go to the conference?
[02:48:25.069 --> 02:48:26.050]  Oh no, we're just fans.
[02:48:26.990 --> 02:48:28.750]  I mean, it's just everywhere.
[02:48:29.531 --> 02:48:30.971]  So, New World Order, you're in trouble.
[02:48:31.051 --> 02:48:35.352]  I mean, every cop I talked to was aware of what's going on.
[02:48:35.372 --> 02:48:37.993]  I mean, because they're not stupid, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:38.013 --> 02:48:39.333]  They're not stupid.
[02:48:39.653 --> 02:48:42.294]  We're not as stupid as you think we are.
[02:48:42.654 --> 02:48:43.554]  More calls straight ahead.
[02:48:46.050 --> 02:48:47.551]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.731 --> 02:48:50.812]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.952 --> 02:48:54.834]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.894 --> 02:48:59.115]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:59.476 --> 02:49:03.237]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:03.377 --> 02:49:05.198]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.438 --> 02:49:08.702]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[02:49:08.722 --> 02:49:13.467]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.607 --> 02:49:16.650]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:16.830 --> 02:49:19.714]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:20.174 --> 02:49:26.301]  The neighbors in that area, Sandpoint Naval Air Station, were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.821 --> 02:49:30.603]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:49:46.167 --> 02:49:49.169]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:49:49.509 --> 02:49:58.333]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:49:58.674 --> 02:50:03.336]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:50:03.796 --> 02:50:10.523]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:10.923 --> 02:50:22.715]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:50:23.175 --> 02:50:27.637]  The Berkey Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[02:50:46.989 --> 02:50:47.330]  I think so.
[02:51:02.233 --> 02:51:02.894]  We're good to go!

[02:51:56.982 --> 02:51:58.602]  I'm just getting it out as fast as possible.
[02:51:58.622 --> 02:51:59.963]  It does not have the extras on it yet.
[02:51:59.983 --> 02:52:00.863]  That'll be about a month.
[02:52:01.243 --> 02:52:03.544]  But if you want it now, it'll be a collector's edition.
[02:52:03.564 --> 02:52:07.265]  It even says American Scholar Symposium on the front of it.
[02:52:07.285 --> 02:52:09.965]  You know, when you open the DVD up on your television or computer.
[02:52:09.985 --> 02:52:11.886]  It's a special edition.
[02:52:11.906 --> 02:52:14.047]  A little bit longer than the actual edition we're going to put out.
[02:52:14.067 --> 02:52:15.067]  We've cut a few minutes out of it.
[02:52:16.015 --> 02:52:17.135]  I will sign every one of them.
[02:52:17.155 --> 02:52:18.656]  There's only about 450 of them.
[02:52:18.676 --> 02:52:27.979]  They will go quick, so if you want those, get them at Infowars.com right now, or see the whole film online at PrisonPlanet.tv right now in high bandwidth, low bandwidth, you name it, and all my other films.
[02:52:28.399 --> 02:52:31.820]  And it's a great place to burn it to DVD or to CD to give to people.
[02:52:32.120 --> 02:52:34.040]  Help us get TerrorStorm out to everyone right now.
[02:52:34.060 --> 02:52:36.901]  Available at Infowars.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:52:40.572 --> 02:52:41.452]  Let's go ahead.
[02:52:41.532 --> 02:52:42.553]  Yes, the long wait is over.
[02:52:42.773 --> 02:52:43.613]  10 months of hard work.
[02:52:43.653 --> 02:52:44.634]  Really, almost 11 months.
[02:52:44.914 --> 02:52:46.034]  Terror Storm is here.
[02:52:46.915 --> 02:52:47.695]  My best film yet.
[02:52:47.735 --> 02:52:48.335]  Wait until you see it.
[02:52:49.776 --> 02:52:52.097]  Let's go ahead and go to Gil in Texas.
[02:52:52.157 --> 02:52:52.857]  Gil, welcome.
[02:52:53.297 --> 02:52:56.299]  I'm putting everyone in the government on notice.
[02:52:56.499 --> 02:53:02.141]  They're on notice that if they're monitoring my call or anything, the pit they're digging for me, I'm gonna push a minute.
[02:53:03.287 --> 02:53:04.787]  I got a question for you, Alex.
[02:53:04.927 --> 02:53:06.668]  Two guests, Ed Asner.
[02:53:06.908 --> 02:53:07.648]  What do you think of him?
[02:53:08.008 --> 02:53:08.848]  And I have another one.
[02:53:08.908 --> 02:53:10.829]  I'm going to hold it until you tell me what you think of him.
[02:53:10.869 --> 02:53:13.730]  I don't agree with a lot of his politics, but let me answer your question.
[02:53:14.630 --> 02:53:16.850]  But I appreciate his courage going public on 9-11.
[02:53:17.991 --> 02:53:20.911]  Kinky Freedman, the independent running for governor of Texas.
[02:53:20.931 --> 02:53:21.551]  How about him?
[02:53:22.092 --> 02:53:23.452]  I agree with a lot of his policies.
[02:53:23.472 --> 02:53:24.892]  He's certainly better than Rick Perry.
[02:53:25.692 --> 02:53:26.793]  You probably have him as a guest.
[02:53:26.813 --> 02:53:27.453]  He's the one of them.
[02:53:27.473 --> 02:53:28.213]  That's a good idea.
[02:53:28.233 --> 02:53:29.213]  Let's get Kinky Freedman.
[02:53:29.253 --> 02:53:29.974]  Kevin, you heard that.
[02:53:31.154 --> 02:53:31.834]  And Ed Asner.
[02:53:33.073 --> 02:53:33.553]  What about him?
[02:53:33.773 --> 02:53:35.594]  You're going to probably have him as a guest as well?
[02:53:35.754 --> 02:53:36.615]  I've had him as a guest.
[02:53:36.715 --> 02:53:37.435]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:53:37.555 --> 02:53:39.796]  And again, they're on notice if they're monitoring my calls.
[02:53:39.816 --> 02:53:43.017]  I'm going to push them in the pit they're trying to dig for me and anyone else.
[02:53:43.097 --> 02:53:43.457]  Thank you.
[02:53:43.717 --> 02:53:44.158]  Thank you.
[02:53:44.498 --> 02:53:48.980]  Well, AT&T makes you sign a waiver now when you've got any business with them that you don't own.
[02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:49.920]  Your phone call, nothing.
[02:53:49.940 --> 02:53:50.720]  They're going to spy on you.
[02:53:50.740 --> 02:53:51.541]  They're telling you up front.
[02:53:51.721 --> 02:53:53.702]  At least be honest about what's been happening since 96.
[02:53:54.642 --> 02:53:56.203]  They're all doing it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:53:56.983 --> 02:53:59.004]  Rob, you're on the air from Pennsylvania.
[02:53:59.024 --> 02:53:59.384]  Welcome.
[02:53:59.824 --> 02:54:00.644]  Alex, how are you, sir?
[02:54:00.664 --> 02:54:01.965]  It's a great pleasure to talk to you.
[02:54:02.671 --> 02:54:09.035]  I just wanted to say that I think it's a real honor, personally, to be following up Fetzer and Dr. Wen-Yu Wang.
[02:54:09.055 --> 02:54:19.561]  I had originally wanted to speak with Dr. Fetzer and see what he thought of the way he was handled with respect to the Hannity and Combs affair.
[02:54:19.581 --> 02:54:24.604]  They threw him on there with Ollie North on and off week and off-peak ratings week.
[02:54:25.306 --> 02:54:27.847]  They kind of set him up, and I think he handled it pretty well.
[02:54:28.287 --> 02:54:29.567]  I don't watch TV myself.
[02:54:29.627 --> 02:54:36.109]  I listen to radio, but it's getting even harder to come by information on radio, let alone entertainment.
[02:54:37.049 --> 02:54:40.450]  And I do, as I said, appreciate everything that you're doing.
[02:54:40.830 --> 02:54:43.030]  I'd like to get your thoughts about what they did with him.
[02:54:44.231 --> 02:54:45.491]  Well, I mean, they tried to set him up.
[02:54:45.511 --> 02:54:46.931]  They tried to twist things, but it didn't work.
[02:54:46.971 --> 02:54:47.991]  Thanks for the call, Rob.
[02:54:48.211 --> 02:54:49.752]  Andy in Illinois.
[02:54:49.792 --> 02:54:50.412]  Last caller.
[02:54:50.492 --> 02:54:51.152]  Welcome, Andy.
[02:54:51.812 --> 02:54:52.292]  Hey, Alex.
[02:54:52.312 --> 02:54:53.853]  I just want to give you some encouragement.
[02:54:55.231 --> 02:54:59.433]  I handed out one of your films, Order of Death, to a pastor.
[02:54:59.933 --> 02:55:06.855]  He showed it to his entire class, and he goes to people's houses, his friends' houses, you know, on a regular basis and shows the films.
[02:55:07.615 --> 02:55:09.796]  Also, I had another friend I loaned Marshall Law to.
[02:55:09.816 --> 02:55:13.197]  He was not convinced, but last night he listened to George Nory.
[02:55:13.217 --> 02:55:14.558]  There was a guest on on 9-11.
[02:55:14.598 --> 02:55:15.818]  Now he's beginning to come around.
[02:55:15.838 --> 02:55:20.100]  The whole idea is, like you said, you sow seeds at first.
[02:55:20.180 --> 02:55:21.740]  You don't expect your friends to come around.
[02:55:22.201 --> 02:55:22.721]  Give it a year.
[02:55:23.877 --> 02:55:24.858]  Majority will wake up.
[02:55:24.918 --> 02:55:28.500]  I would say 90% of the people I've exposed this information to have woken up.
[02:55:29.581 --> 02:55:30.621]  And that's all I have to say.
[02:55:30.681 --> 02:55:31.222]  God bless you.
[02:55:31.502 --> 02:55:31.942]  Thank you.
[02:55:31.982 --> 02:55:33.063]  I appreciate the call.
[02:55:33.243 --> 02:55:38.426]  I mean, every cop I talk to at the conference, before it even started, oh yeah, we all know, of course.
[02:55:39.046 --> 02:55:40.707]  Of course 19 guys didn't do it.
[02:55:40.727 --> 02:55:42.208]  Of course they blew the buildings up.
[02:55:42.608 --> 02:55:45.010]  Of course, because they... Oh boy.
[02:55:46.249 --> 02:55:47.810]  We're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:47.831 --> 02:55:50.153]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:55:50.193 --> 02:55:51.354]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:55:51.754 --> 02:55:54.016]  More great guest information throughout the week for you.
[02:55:54.056 --> 02:55:55.097]  I'm so honored to be your host.
[02:55:55.517 --> 02:55:56.979]  I'm so honored and blessed to be on the air.
[02:55:57.019 --> 02:56:01.843]  I'm so blessed to work with all these great people and to have made this new film, Terror Storm, that I'm so proud of.
[02:56:01.883 --> 02:56:04.666]  A whole new level with the music, the graphics, the information.
[02:56:05.495 --> 02:56:15.661]  From 9-11 to other state-sponsored terror events, to the war in Iraq, to the police state, it covers it all, to mind control, to propaganda like no other film I've ever made.
