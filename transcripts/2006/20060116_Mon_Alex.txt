[00:00:05.632 --> 00:00:06.292]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.932 --> 00:00:08.012]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.712 --> 00:00:09.813]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.453 --> 00:00:11.293]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:12.974]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.614 --> 00:00:17.255]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.775 --> 00:00:21.916]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.657 --> 00:00:31.799]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:00:36.741 --> 00:00:38.905]  I'd like to thank you for joining us today.
[00:00:38.925 --> 00:00:42.592]  The 16th day of January 2006 and we're going to be live here.
[00:00:47.006 --> 00:01:06.501]  For the next three hours, and we're going to have wide open phones for the entire show to let you get involved on air, to bring up different news items, to talk about different pieces of mainstream propaganda that need to be exposed, or legislation, you name it, it's all coming up today.
[00:01:07.181 --> 00:01:11.004]  Report, MS-13 gang hired to murder Border Patrol.
[00:01:11.565 --> 00:01:14.587]  That, of course, out of the Daily Bulletin last Friday.
[00:01:16.405 --> 00:01:24.551]  And it's old news that they have been, not just hired, but been murdering border patrol, police, sheriff's deputies, you name it.
[00:01:26.872 --> 00:01:30.715]  Now that's on the heels of this headline, Mexican troops defiant.
[00:01:30.815 --> 00:01:31.196]  Border?
[00:01:31.776 --> 00:01:32.416]  What border?
[00:01:33.197 --> 00:01:40.182]  Military crosses into America 216 times during past nine years.
[00:01:40.262 --> 00:01:44.365]  That's the documented confirmed cases and it's accelerating, it's
[00:01:45.894 --> 00:01:54.218]  Increasing in its frequency and World Net Daily's got some quotes from different sheriffs and police chiefs and border patrol agents about how bad it is.
[00:01:54.258 --> 00:02:06.603]  Well we've had sheriffs on this broadcast from South Texas getting into how Mexican troops will come across the border and at gunpoint
[00:02:07.725 --> 00:02:17.450]  Take a large, you know, 18-wheeler away from the Border Patrol and then drag it by bulldozer, military bulldozer, back across the border.
[00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:26.155]  I mean, that's... And in that case, of course, because the truck was stuck and ran off the road, running from U.S.
[00:02:26.195 --> 00:02:28.496]  authorities, that is, public servants.
[00:02:28.956 --> 00:02:32.058]  But they call themselves authorities, so it's hard to get away from that term.
[00:02:33.591 --> 00:02:44.199]  52% of Americans are saying impeach Bush on wiretaps alone, Zogby poll, most one action of US citizens monitored, without judges okay.
[00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:45.460]  So we'll get into that a little bit more.
[00:02:46.181 --> 00:02:52.664]  Well, a lot more, and we'll also get back into what's happening with our crumbling borders and how it's all been done by design.
[00:02:53.465 --> 00:03:00.868]  Back to the impeachment, Senator Specter is saying that it may happen, but he's a consummate insider just playing politics.
[00:03:00.908 --> 00:03:04.270]  But now the I-word, the impeachment word, is out of the box.
[00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:20.715]  Folks, as much as I'd like to see that at a certain level, because I don't like George Bush, and I supported the impeachment of Bill Clinton as well, Bill Clinton and George Bush are just puppets, and we need to start talking more about the elite that own them as so much pocket change in their back pocket.
[00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:28.037]  Meanwhile, talking about spying, you remember people want Bush impeached over some of the tertiary spying that they've heard about.
[00:03:28.378 --> 00:03:28.858]  What about this?
[00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:30.820]  U.C.
[00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.989]  Santa Cruz student protest, a credible threat to national security for the Pentagon, was out watching the students.
[00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:46.543]  And then I have a whole nother report here, where the NSA, of course, is having local police spy on groups.
[00:03:47.402 --> 00:03:57.676]  There's just a whole stack of these news articles today, and all over the nation they're announcing that you'll need ID to buy cold medicine in Illinois.
[00:03:57.716 --> 00:04:01.841]  What's already locked out here in Texas, and you're saying, what does that have to do with the NSA?
[00:04:02.382 --> 00:04:04.304]  It's all part of the tracking grid.
[00:04:04.425 --> 00:04:05.306]  Every subscription.
[00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.033]  You get from major publishers is being tracked and traced.
[00:04:10.494 --> 00:04:20.081]  Every prescription, prescription you get for drugs or even for something like a prosthesis or a diaphragm is instantly uploaded.
[00:04:20.962 --> 00:04:26.986]  But then they debate whether, oh, should the NSA be able to trace a call from Al-Qaeda to America.
[00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:29.909]  That's just the, not even the tip of the iceberg.
[00:04:29.929 --> 00:04:34.032]  It's just a shaving of ice on the tip of the iceberg.
[00:04:35.507 --> 00:04:42.674]  We'll get into the real ID, a nightmare for the states, DMV officials across the country bemoan logistical difficulties.
[00:04:43.014 --> 00:04:45.917]  Not the fact that it's a 10th Amendment violation or a police state.
[00:04:46.618 --> 00:04:46.798]  No.
[00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:48.119]  That's not the problem.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.281]  Look, there's so much news today.

[00:04:55.707 --> 00:04:56.367]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:09.697]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:14.722]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:05:14.942 --> 00:05:20.588]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:05:20.808 --> 00:05:25.352]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:05:25.572 --> 00:05:32.718]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:05:32.738 --> 00:05:37.282]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.442 --> 00:05:39.964]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:05:40.184 --> 00:05:46.950]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[00:08:02.596 --> 00:08:08.640]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.241 --> 00:08:12.223]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.131 --> 00:08:19.494]  Welcome to this live Monday edition, 16th day of January 2006.
[00:08:19.594 --> 00:08:23.617]  We're now 8 minutes 20 seconds into this first hour.
[00:08:23.677 --> 00:08:25.198]  This is our second segment.
[00:08:25.578 --> 00:08:28.700]  I know many stations though carry 5-6 minutes of news.
[00:08:29.061 --> 00:08:32.283]  And so this is really the start of the broadcast for many.
[00:08:33.357 --> 00:08:59.239]  Coming up, we're going to get into the drums of war, the impending military strikes on Iran, and I want to try to run through some of the repercussions, some of the fallout, the possible aftermath, depending on the breaks in this high-stakes pool game that the New World Order is engaging in with all of our lives, our economy, our future in the balance.
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:13.742]  A lot of people thought that the New World Order would not have the nerve to invade Iraq, but they did do it on falsified, fake intelligence premeditatedly brought forward to the public and Congress.
[00:09:14.597 --> 00:09:18.840]  And a lot of people today think that the globalists won't strike Iran.
[00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:24.223]  I wouldn't put it past them, and I wouldn't bet against them attacking.
[00:09:24.283 --> 00:09:36.231]  But it does depend greatly on how we respond, and what we say and what we do as Americans, or as just people living on this planet, period, to this neo-fascist empire.
[00:09:37.512 --> 00:09:41.375]  A neo-fascist empire that is not Republican or Democrat.
[00:09:41.495 --> 00:09:43.356]  The New World Order owns those little ponds.
[00:09:44.292 --> 00:10:04.961]  No, this is a global crime syndicate that controls almost every major nation on the face of the earth and is now moving those governments, which they have bought and paid for, to dissolve those nations' sovereignty and to give their governmental power over to unelected, unaccountable, tyrannical world government bodies.
[00:10:07.697 --> 00:10:15.079]  Now, I remember the days, 12 years ago, when if you talked about a new world order, it didn't exist and you were insane.
[00:10:15.599 --> 00:10:19.060]  Now there's a world government, globalism, global governance.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:25.881]  Now it's publicly admitted, but the spin is, if you're for it, you're a good, wonderful intellectual.
[00:10:25.901 --> 00:10:28.742]  If you're against it, you're an evil, backward demon.
[00:10:29.685 --> 00:10:43.167]  But you look at the polls, you look at the Europeans rejecting EU expansion last year, you look at Latin America regurgitating and basically spitting out the American Union operation.
[00:10:44.056 --> 00:10:48.479]  You see that people worldwide are beginning to realize what's happening.
[00:10:48.519 --> 00:11:02.189]  The blinders are starting to come off their eyes, and they're getting past all of the false left-right rhetoric, Tory versus Labor, Republican versus Democrat, and they're beginning to realize that it really is a staged event.
[00:11:02.569 --> 00:11:09.794]  And they're beginning to see the marionette controllers, the puppet masters, the man behind the curtain.
[00:11:11.187 --> 00:11:18.212]  So today we're going to get into the Iran situation, get into the Iraq situation, the latest developments there.
[00:11:19.213 --> 00:11:28.880]  We'll also of course get into the hundreds and hundreds, well to be exact, and it's actually a lot more than this, but the official U.S.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:38.887]  government number is 216 times recently that Mexican troops have been coming across the border and shooting at border patrol, killing cops,
[00:11:39.367 --> 00:11:40.588]  Killing American citizens.
[00:11:40.648 --> 00:11:42.009]  Kidnapping American citizens.
[00:11:42.349 --> 00:11:50.235]  Meanwhile, Alberto Gonzalez, the Attorney General, is ordering immigration courts to quote, be nicer, to quote, the immigrants.
[00:11:51.483 --> 00:11:53.865]  And of course, everybody knows it's a catch and release.
[00:11:53.885 --> 00:11:55.767]  I mean, that's federal law.
[00:11:55.847 --> 00:11:59.170]  They catch them, and they enroll them, and they release them.
[00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:11.061]  Everybody knows that the laws are not enforced equally upon the first-class illegal alien citizens, and that citizens are the poor schmucks that are seen as fools that are fed on by this government.
[00:12:11.101 --> 00:12:16.626]  But here it is, and I guess the cops love having bounties
[00:12:17.442 --> 00:12:21.420]  Here in Texas, on their heads by the Los Zetas and MS...
[00:12:22.174 --> 00:12:31.797]  MS-13, because they seem to, the police unions and the rest of it, seem to go along with leaving all the illegal aliens alone while harassing the citizens.
[00:12:31.857 --> 00:12:37.459]  I don't care if you're Hispanic, black, white, or if you are pink with purple polka dots.
[00:12:38.339 --> 00:12:41.540]  As long as you're a citizen, you're pushed around and treated like an idiot.
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:43.661]  But if you're an illegal alien, everything's fine.
[00:12:44.061 --> 00:12:49.363]  And now there's major talk about impeaching Bush for all of the spying.
[00:12:50.263 --> 00:12:51.264]  Again, the media does this.
[00:12:51.325 --> 00:12:53.066]  It's part of the controlled media.
[00:12:53.086 --> 00:12:57.371]  And we're not talking about a liberal media.
[00:12:57.391 --> 00:12:59.874]  We're not talking about a conservative media.
[00:12:59.934 --> 00:13:03.318]  Those are just skins or camouflage that they wear.
[00:13:04.554 --> 00:13:10.215]  And they try to divert us and distract us with, oh, I'm a liberal, I'm for this, or, oh, I'm a conservative, I'm for that.
[00:13:10.555 --> 00:13:17.196]  At the end of the day, the dominant individuals on the nightly news, in the media, are government agents.
[00:13:17.856 --> 00:13:23.157]  And the government itself is an agent of the international crime syndicate known as the New World Order.
[00:13:24.077 --> 00:13:32.719]  Thousands of reporters aren't liberal or conservative, they are government operatives pulling large paychecks yearly, or
[00:13:34.466 --> 00:13:51.176]  They're local reporters who were just simply told, go out and do this report, and the station itself is getting government or foundation money to go package a newscast that is really PR or public relations.
[00:13:51.216 --> 00:13:54.078]  You see, we try to cut through all of that here.
[00:13:55.851 --> 00:14:07.542]  Liberals who don't like the fact that I'm against big government and gun control and open borders and IMF and World Bank control of our economy call me an ultra right-wing extremist.
[00:14:08.559 --> 00:14:23.705]  Mindless, wannabe, conservative, neocon camp followers, who don't care if Bush is appointing anti-gun judges and attorney generals, who don't care if Bush signs on to UNESCO and UN regulation of our entire economy and educational system.
[00:14:24.626 --> 00:14:35.070]  Phony conservatives who like the fact that Bush has spent more money than all presidents before him combined, most of it on big government programs, classical socialist programs.
[00:14:36.056 --> 00:14:40.877]  They call me a commie, because I'm against their communist policies.
[00:14:41.317 --> 00:14:44.197]  So really, we don't have Republicans and Democrats in this country.
[00:14:44.538 --> 00:14:53.319]  We have mindless slaves who bought into the false political paradigm, who don't even know who they are, or what the history of this country is.
[00:14:54.019 --> 00:15:04.061]  Who buy into the frauds that you hear on talk radio, predominantly, whether they're left or right, who were there to keep you inside those two corrals.
[00:15:04.719 --> 00:15:07.962]  They don't want you off the reservation, off the plantation.
[00:15:08.203 --> 00:15:13.028]  They know you're going to demand some type of choice, so they give you the false left-right choice.
[00:15:16.019 --> 00:15:22.301]  And the evidence of this is most of the powerful Democrats, well not most, all of them are for the war.
[00:15:22.341 --> 00:15:28.544]  They're just, we don't like how you handled it, and you shouldn't have lied about it, but since we're there, we've got to increase the troops.
[00:15:28.604 --> 00:15:30.204]  We've got to invade Iran.
[00:15:30.985 --> 00:15:34.806]  We've got to, Bush, you're not doing a big enough job of this.
[00:15:34.866 --> 00:15:42.169]  We need to... And they'll have, well, the Democrats said, we're against your national ID card, Bush, last year when he got it passed.
[00:15:43.135 --> 00:15:44.936]  And then Democrats outvoted Republicans.
[00:15:45.096 --> 00:15:52.401]  Or, we're against your new freedom initiative for psychological testing and drugging, but then they actually almost outvoted Republicans.
[00:15:52.661 --> 00:15:56.263]  You see, when it gets to, you know, Bush has only said no to a few bills.
[00:15:56.724 --> 00:15:57.924]  He has a record.
[00:15:59.565 --> 00:16:00.446]  He has a record.
[00:16:01.888 --> 00:16:10.693]  In his first five years of signing more legislation and signing more pork barrel than any president before him, he never says no.
[00:16:11.033 --> 00:16:13.215]  He says yes to everything.
[00:16:13.835 --> 00:16:15.576]  That's why the establishment just loves it.
[00:16:15.596 --> 00:16:22.620]  I mean, if you've got a big company and a lobbyist, you can put in maybe $20,000 in lobbying, you get $50 million back in contracts.
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.561]  And you don't even have to start work.
[00:16:24.601 --> 00:16:25.882]  You don't have to do anything.
[00:16:26.342 --> 00:16:27.883]  You don't even have to implement anything.
[00:16:27.903 --> 00:16:29.424]  You just take the money and run.
[00:16:31.087 --> 00:16:33.028]  It's totally criminal.
[00:16:33.168 --> 00:16:36.969]  Look, here's two examples of what I'm talking about, and then I'm going to get into more of the news.
[00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:41.790]  We have a lot of new stations.
[00:16:41.831 --> 00:16:44.131]  I think just today, three new stations turned us on.
[00:16:44.151 --> 00:16:46.892]  Today, throughout the week, three more turned us on.
[00:16:47.532 --> 00:16:49.573]  And then next Monday, two more stations.
[00:16:49.593 --> 00:16:52.014]  Just a whole bunch by the
[00:16:53.274 --> 00:16:55.115]  I know by, what, the 22nd.
[00:16:55.375 --> 00:17:00.657]  So I have to, I guess every day, kind of recap what we are, what we do, what we believe in.
[00:17:00.677 --> 00:17:02.518]  Because we don't follow all the labels.
[00:17:03.118 --> 00:17:04.119]  You want to have a label?
[00:17:04.479 --> 00:17:06.179]  It's constitutionalist.
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:11.682]  You see, I don't look at George Bush and go, well, he's a Republican and he wears a cowboy hat.
[00:17:12.622 --> 00:17:32.923]  He covers up his Atlantic accent, so I'm going to associate my personal power with him while he doubles the size of the BATF and systematically uses regulations, not even laws, to start restricting the Second Amendment, and while Republican governors sue gun manufacturers from California to New York and are on the verge of
[00:17:33.183 --> 00:17:35.104]  We're actually shutting them down.
[00:17:35.304 --> 00:17:39.507]  We're very close to going into the gun shop and instead of twenty brands, there's five brands.
[00:17:39.827 --> 00:17:41.528]  And then ten years from now, there's one brand.
[00:17:41.688 --> 00:17:43.149]  And then you can just forget it, folks.
[00:17:43.929 --> 00:17:44.270]  Okay?
[00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:47.412]  You see, I'm actually wedded to the Second Amendment.
[00:17:47.772 --> 00:17:50.654]  I'm actually in love with the Tenth Amendment.
[00:17:50.834 --> 00:17:52.535]  I'm actually in love with the First Amendment.
[00:17:52.795 --> 00:17:58.478]  I actually love George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson.
[00:17:58.538 --> 00:18:00.359]  I actually am Americana.
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:02.641]  And I just want to get people into that.
[00:18:03.621 --> 00:18:16.064]  As excited about George Washington and the Bill of Rights and Patrick Henry and Mr. Payne as they are about the UT Horns winning the National Championship.
[00:18:18.404 --> 00:18:19.865]  So, here's a quick example.
[00:18:19.905 --> 00:18:26.606]  The neocons get up and go, we've got to do something about immigration, immigration, oh it's horrible, we're being invaded, it's horrible, because they know you're awake to it.
[00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:29.592]  They know they can't propagandize you anymore.
[00:18:30.092 --> 00:18:31.373]  So then they put a spin on it.
[00:18:31.613 --> 00:18:33.574]  We've got to stop these evil Democrats.
[00:18:33.614 --> 00:18:34.655]  I've actually heard these words.
[00:18:34.675 --> 00:18:36.496]  We've got to stop these horrible Democrats.
[00:18:36.956 --> 00:18:39.298]  They're blocking Bush's plan to fix this.
[00:18:39.918 --> 00:18:41.679]  The Democrats wrote the bill.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.161]  It's blanket, total amnesty.
[00:18:44.401 --> 00:18:46.482]  But reading off the script, they've got to be.
[00:18:46.823 --> 00:18:47.223]  I've heard
[00:18:48.366 --> 00:18:49.367]  All the top neocons.
[00:18:49.387 --> 00:18:50.627]  I listen to talk radio.
[00:18:51.488 --> 00:18:53.829]  I can hear Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, Austin.
[00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:55.430]  So I get it all.
[00:18:56.171 --> 00:19:03.174]  Basically, whatever's out there, it's on the 20 plus talk stations I can choose from that come into Austin, Texas.
[00:19:03.194 --> 00:19:04.855]  So I monitor and listen to it.
[00:19:04.895 --> 00:19:05.676]  It's all the same thing.
[00:19:06.497 --> 00:19:08.718]  People call, oh thank you for fighting immigration.
[00:19:09.059 --> 00:19:13.563]  The listeners don't know that it's like, here quick, your house is on fire.
[00:19:14.283 --> 00:19:18.287]  Run out this door, and then when you run out the door, somebody shoots you with a shotgun.
[00:19:18.927 --> 00:19:20.529]  They're not doing you a favor.
[00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:31.438]  Okay, or a better analogy, you run out the door and they douse you in gasoline, a bucket of gasoline opens and spills over and they hit you with a flamethrower.
[00:19:32.691 --> 00:19:33.091]  You see?
[00:19:33.712 --> 00:19:35.493]  Oh, we gotta do something about illegal immigration.
[00:19:35.533 --> 00:19:40.237]  It's wrecking this country, and why are those Democrats trying to stop Bush's plan to fix it?
[00:19:41.018 --> 00:19:42.459]  And then you look at the plan!
[00:19:42.519 --> 00:19:44.601]  It was written by Democrats!
[00:19:45.222 --> 00:19:47.964]  See, that's all I do here on this show is I don't play games.
[00:19:48.164 --> 00:19:49.145]  It's not hard to do.
[00:19:50.146 --> 00:19:50.606]  It's simple.
[00:19:50.946 --> 00:19:51.987]  Take education.
[00:19:52.828 --> 00:19:53.689]  Take vouchers.
[00:19:54.489 --> 00:19:56.711]  Take John Stossel's ABC News report.
[00:19:57.512 --> 00:19:58.773]  I'll comment on that when we get back.
[00:20:01.505 --> 00:20:08.372]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[00:20:08.533 --> 00:20:20.866]  What you didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest-growing business opportunity in America today.
[00:20:21.186 --> 00:20:22.888]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[00:20:23.048 --> 00:20:26.511]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[00:20:26.791 --> 00:20:30.574]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[00:20:30.835 --> 00:20:35.799]  Whatever it is you seek, Xangle could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[00:20:36.079 --> 00:20:37.781]  So take matters into your own hands.
[00:20:38.021 --> 00:20:42.022]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[00:20:42.262 --> 00:20:44.102]  Zango is what you are looking for.

[00:23:01.236 --> 00:23:03.838]  Thanks for tuning in to this edition of Coffee on the Air.
[00:23:04.038 --> 00:23:05.459]  I'm your host, Joe Java.
[00:23:05.599 --> 00:23:08.260]  Today we're talking about guilt-free, healthy coffee.
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:11.162]  Yes, it is possible to enjoy healthy coffee.
[00:23:11.422 --> 00:23:13.983]  And on today's episode, we're going to tell you how.
[00:23:14.183 --> 00:23:15.244]  More after this break.
[00:23:16.152 --> 00:23:19.914]  It's time to wake up and start your day on a healthy note with Gano Coffee.
[00:23:20.034 --> 00:23:30.859]  What makes Gano Coffee so special is the addition of high quality Ganoderma from the amazingly nutritious red reishi mushroom that provides energy and health to expel toxins from the body.

[00:23:36.622 --> 00:23:38.363]  Welcome back to Coffee on the Air.
[00:23:38.583 --> 00:23:41.885]  I'm Joe Java with news that you can enjoy guilt-free coffee.
[00:23:41.985 --> 00:23:49.210]  Just visit our website, coffeeontheair.com or call us directly at 866-271-3653.
[00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:58.776]  Stay tuned for the next episode of Coffee on the Air when we discuss how Gano Coffee can boost your immune system and can actually help you get a good night's sleep.
[00:24:10.522 --> 00:24:15.804]  You see, the globalists are masters of co-opting every major movement.
[00:24:16.884 --> 00:24:33.790]  That's why they're in power, that's why they have control, because they're very smart, they're extremely cunning, they're amazingly ruthless, and a lot of times, you know, some of these people in the media are not paid off by the Pentagon, or paid off by the Department of Agriculture, or the Department of Labor.
[00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:35.070]  I mean, there's so many.
[00:24:35.914 --> 00:24:38.557]  Health and Human Services paying off Armstrong Williams.
[00:24:38.617 --> 00:24:41.561]  I just use him because he's one of the better known examples.
[00:24:42.022 --> 00:24:43.043]  Oh, that's another issue!
[00:24:44.025 --> 00:25:09.280]  They will take just one case out of thousands of known cases, and make a big deal out of that specific instance, and then convince people that that's the only instance of it, and then say, oh, we're investigating for more, when there are literally thousands of admitted examples of it, and hearings back in the 60s, and hearings in the 70s admitting that most major newspaper editors are on government payrolls.
[00:25:10.356 --> 00:25:12.017]  It's the same thing with the NSA spying.
[00:25:12.037 --> 00:25:15.959]  They'll go, oh look, there was some overseas calls to hear domestically.
[00:25:16.999 --> 00:25:20.100]  Hmm, you know, should we be able to listen to Bin Laden when he calls America?
[00:25:20.421 --> 00:25:27.744]  But then you go read what the NSA admits they're doing, and they are openly or randomly listening to the American people for decades.
[00:25:28.604 --> 00:25:34.167]  But the media acts like they're doing some big investigation, and then never even covers all the admitted facts.
[00:25:34.567 --> 00:25:36.688]  They always lessen how bad it is.
[00:25:38.249 --> 00:25:52.441]  But getting back to controlled media, I was listening to a big national talk show host this morning getting ready for my own radio show, and he was ranting and raving about John Stossel and how great John Stossel is.
[00:25:53.482 --> 00:25:53.763]  Why?
[00:25:53.823 --> 00:26:05.673]  How does ABC News let John Stossel get up there and tell the truth about education and expose the fact how there's no choice and how the teachers unions are
[00:26:07.111 --> 00:26:10.694]  Literally raping the futures of our children, on and on and on.
[00:26:11.034 --> 00:26:14.296]  And frankly, you know, I like John Stossel better than most.
[00:26:14.676 --> 00:26:17.398]  He tells the truth, let's say, to a greater degree.
[00:26:18.299 --> 00:26:20.100]  His reports are more highbrow.
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:25.544]  I don't particularly dislike John Stossel, but at a certain level I like him.
[00:26:25.584 --> 00:26:32.929]  I mean, I find him very intelligent and informative, but only to a certain level, because he's just like that Neocon talk show host.
[00:26:33.289 --> 00:26:35.671]  He only tells you part of the equation.
[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.842]  And part of the answer is not the answer.
[00:26:38.882 --> 00:26:40.884]  In fact, it's lying by omission.
[00:26:40.944 --> 00:26:47.910]  And frankly, I know John Stossel is not some preening, self-centered individual like Katie Curry or somebody.
[00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:54.975]  I mean, when one of them gets it wrong, I mean, I know it's because they're just leftist buffoons who've never really lived in the real world.
[00:26:55.856 --> 00:27:01.541]  But when a John Stossel gets it wrong, because he's very astute and very intelligent, I know it's premeditated.
[00:27:02.262 --> 00:27:08.490]  And so John Stossel, while we gotta have vouchers, we've gotta give our children choices.
[00:27:10.653 --> 00:27:19.364]  His analogy was, let's say you move into a neighborhood and the government tells you that you can only shop at this one store
[00:27:21.199 --> 00:27:22.940]  And then you go into that store.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.681]  Do you think you're going to have fresh produce?
[00:27:24.701 --> 00:27:27.923]  Do you think you're going to have live choices or freshly baked breads?
[00:27:27.943 --> 00:27:34.367]  Or do you think it's going to be horrible like it was in Russia with people standing in long lines for stale sausages?
[00:27:35.408 --> 00:27:43.293]  And the answer is, we deserve the same choice that we have with grocery stores in education.
[00:27:46.082 --> 00:27:55.329]  But John Stossel on the Neocon talk show host that was worshipping him on the air this morning missed the forest for the trees, or they missed the mountain for the molehill.
[00:27:56.890 --> 00:28:05.196]  The question should be, why would the government be in the business of grocery stores to begin with?
[00:28:05.757 --> 00:28:11.461]  Why is the government in the business of public schools to begin with?
[00:28:12.173 --> 00:28:17.295]  But that's not the real problem, the real flaw, the real disinfo.
[00:28:18.476 --> 00:28:21.677]  They're acting like that the European model was great.
[00:28:22.818 --> 00:28:25.339]  Stossel's talking about how the money follows the child.
[00:28:25.379 --> 00:28:27.960]  That is $7,000 on average in Western Europe.
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:30.341]  The average here is about $12,000 in the U.S.
[00:28:31.341 --> 00:28:33.142]  And they do get a much better education over there.
[00:28:33.482 --> 00:28:37.844]  It follows the child wherever they want to go, if the school will accept them.
[00:28:37.884 --> 00:28:39.885]  It's test scores, public school.
[00:28:41.025 --> 00:28:44.849]  Primary education, that money then follows them, so there is competition.
[00:28:45.229 --> 00:28:46.390]  Teachers get paid more.
[00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:51.035]  And you're like, well, how do they have an average lower for education when the teachers get paid more?
[00:28:51.055 --> 00:28:52.777]  Because it's not top-heavy, folks.
[00:28:53.357 --> 00:28:54.238]  Again, it's competitive.
[00:28:54.418 --> 00:28:58.782]  The teachers might be getting the equivalent of $100,000 a year just at a primary school.
[00:29:00.124 --> 00:29:05.309]  But here, you're getting $35,000 a year and still worshipping the union that you think is your friend.
[00:29:07.532 --> 00:29:19.180]  But what the neocons don't tell you is the big foundations and the big money men, over a decade ago, we got the documents and we've had number two from the Department of Education on this show, Charlotte Isbry, many, many times.
[00:29:19.541 --> 00:29:29.768]  What they don't tell you, and this is the key, I'll tell you when we get back from break, because this is very, very serious.
[00:29:30.668 --> 00:29:33.070]  You see, you think all these vouchers and things are great.
[00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:35.072]  They've created a false debate.
[00:29:35.452 --> 00:29:37.073]  It seems reasonable.
[00:29:37.857 --> 00:29:38.758]  But it's a trap.
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.161]  And we'll break that down when we get back.
[00:29:41.542 --> 00:29:45.707]  Cover the impeachment news, the Iran war news, the spying news.
[00:29:45.867 --> 00:29:46.848]  Take your calls as well.

[00:31:01.781 --> 00:31:05.925]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:31:06.045 --> 00:31:08.927]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:31:09.007 --> 00:31:15.712]  The powerful Black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.

[00:31:21.637 --> 00:31:26.341]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[00:31:26.681 --> 00:31:41.084]  Buy Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Apcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum aren't extracted.

[00:32:00.609 --> 00:32:03.931]  In the past few years, millions of Americans have made the switch to natural products.
[00:32:04.251 --> 00:32:09.553]  Herbs, minerals, vitamins, and essential oils are now being recognized as the safest and most effective products in the quest for good health.
[00:32:09.793 --> 00:32:11.654]  Introducing Vitamir Mouthwash and Toothpaste.

[00:33:00.714 --> 00:33:05.838]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:06.518 --> 00:33:08.880]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:11.262 --> 00:33:14.084]  I always get overheated here on the show.
[00:33:14.144 --> 00:33:18.047]  I get going a little bit too fast because there's so many facets that I want to get into.
[00:33:19.388 --> 00:33:20.649]  What's wrong with this argument?
[00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:27.334]  The PR men and women of the world, the public relations propagandists,
[00:33:28.542 --> 00:33:39.789]  Know that by giving you false choices, most people tend to then think that the two or three choices they're being given are the sum total of choices if that's all they see in front of them.
[00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:44.292]  We've got to get people to start thinking about choices outside the box.
[00:33:45.993 --> 00:33:47.354]  And it's really common sense.
[00:33:47.494 --> 00:33:50.536]  We had the best educational system in the world.
[00:33:51.016 --> 00:33:55.159]  We're the envy of the planet when government wasn't involved in education.
[00:33:56.042 --> 00:34:03.676]  Government was involved at very limited levels, right up until about 60 years ago.
[00:34:03.777 --> 00:34:04.899]  And then with World War II,
[00:34:06.459 --> 00:34:08.581]  The government began, quote, the G.I.
[00:34:08.661 --> 00:34:09.022]  Bill.
[00:34:09.122 --> 00:34:10.062]  Sounded real good.
[00:34:10.143 --> 00:34:11.323]  Actually helped a lot of people.
[00:34:11.704 --> 00:34:13.846]  But the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[00:34:14.326 --> 00:34:24.674]  And by the end of it, Eisenhower, when he gave his farewell address in 1961, said, beware the undue influence of the military-industrial complex to take over our society.
[00:34:25.095 --> 00:34:29.779]  And now today, over 90% of the funding of universities is
[00:34:30.419 --> 00:34:31.761]  Federal or governmental.
[00:34:32.261 --> 00:34:39.468]  And locally, what the federal government is funding about 20% of education, but getting near 100% control.
[00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:48.136]  And they even have whole colleges, whole college courses, whole seminars on the Delphi technique and other management techniques.
[00:34:48.677 --> 00:34:51.500]  I heard the Round Rock mayor
[00:34:52.402 --> 00:34:57.807]  On the news this weekend, following Delphi to the T, you know better than us.
[00:34:58.827 --> 00:35:00.509]  You know how to run the government.
[00:35:00.569 --> 00:35:01.670]  I want to hear from you.
[00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:05.533]  Start coming to my open house and tell me what you want.
[00:35:05.553 --> 00:35:07.835]  Because they've got a bunch of new horrible proposals.
[00:35:08.095 --> 00:35:12.899]  They're going to, quote, hear from everyone and then say, oh, we heard from you.
[00:35:13.419 --> 00:35:15.381]  You want exactly what we want.
[00:35:15.801 --> 00:35:19.925]  And then they found that people, if they're just included on the surface,
[00:35:21.081 --> 00:35:21.741]  We're good to go.
[00:35:45.322 --> 00:35:54.128]  So John Stossel makes the argument that on ABC News with a John Stossel special that why can't we have choice?
[00:35:54.249 --> 00:36:09.940]  Why did one teacher in Florida sue to block the children of disadvantaged, failed schools to be able to go to the state board or be able to go to the independent school district
[00:36:10.698 --> 00:36:19.874]  And get a check, get their portion of that money, and then take it to a private school or get it transferred to another public school.
[00:36:20.948 --> 00:36:29.931]  And I mean, how dare that teacher sue and come out and say that she said competition is bad for kids and we need all this money for the children?
[00:36:30.051 --> 00:36:30.432]  No.
[00:36:30.872 --> 00:36:34.073]  The greedy, top-heavy bureaucrats want that money.
[00:36:34.333 --> 00:36:43.076]  But of course it's some teacher being hurt by a system where if she was a good teacher and in a free market system she'd be paid a lot more.
[00:36:43.837 --> 00:36:47.598]  See, the teachers back up this system because they've been propagandized as well.
[00:36:48.985 --> 00:36:51.486]  But you're saying, Alex, what's the big news item?
[00:36:51.966 --> 00:36:54.327]  I mean, what is it that the neocons aren't telling us?
[00:36:54.367 --> 00:36:55.407]  Well, let me boil it down.
[00:36:56.988 --> 00:37:03.130]  Just like with the immigration issue, the fake conservative talk show hosts will get up and tell you about the problem.
[00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:09.972]  The troops shooting our police, the open borders, the drug dealers, the American citizens being kidnapped.
[00:37:10.573 --> 00:37:17.275]  But then their solution is total blanket amnesty, total capitulation, total legalization.
[00:37:18.012 --> 00:37:29.457]  And then they'll even act like the Democrats are against it, and we better get this through, the Democrats are fighting it, knowing that 98% of their audience isn't aware of the fact that the Democrats pinned the legislation.
[00:37:29.657 --> 00:37:33.098]  And the Democrats even play along, they even get up and, you better watch it!
[00:37:33.918 --> 00:37:35.559]  You know, I'm really mad about this!
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:53.098]  I had a city manager on from Major City just last Friday, and he was talking about how it was all staged, how most of this really is the equivalent of WWF wrestling.
[00:37:54.159 --> 00:37:56.381]  So it's the same thing with the vouchers.
[00:37:56.642 --> 00:37:58.464]  The federal government
[00:37:59.942 --> 00:38:05.366]  ...has reported in internal memos and its own documents that they are actually for vouchers.
[00:38:06.087 --> 00:38:10.430]  And they're actually beginning to introduce it to the public and get us to accept it.
[00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:15.413]  Now why would the control freaks in the federal government do something like that?
[00:38:15.553 --> 00:38:15.914]  Simple.
[00:38:16.814 --> 00:38:22.999]  In the last, really, 20 years, there has been an exodus out of the public schools.
[00:38:24.531 --> 00:38:28.572]  People are going more and more to private school, more and more to homeschooling.
[00:38:28.912 --> 00:38:32.833]  Homeschooling is the minority, but it's the fastest-growing sector.
[00:38:33.834 --> 00:38:34.294]  What?
[00:38:34.394 --> 00:38:38.395]  Five years ago, there were about 300,000 homeschooling children.
[00:38:38.875 --> 00:38:40.436]  Last year, I saw the numbers.
[00:38:40.536 --> 00:38:44.477]  It's over 3 million now.
[00:38:45.897 --> 00:38:49.058]  So, you go from a couple hundred thousand, 300,000 or so, to over 3 million.
[00:38:53.294 --> 00:38:55.335]  And you go back even longer.
[00:38:55.355 --> 00:38:59.557]  I mean, homeschooling was unknown 15-20 years ago.
[00:38:59.977 --> 00:39:03.478]  Now it is widespread, and it is what the wealthy are doing.
[00:39:04.219 --> 00:39:06.120]  It is what the well-to-do are doing.
[00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:10.441]  It is what the upper middle class and the newly rich, the nouveau riche, are doing.
[00:39:13.102 --> 00:39:16.504]  So in summation, the feds are panicking.
[00:39:17.233 --> 00:39:20.836]  How do they get control of all the schools?
[00:39:21.336 --> 00:39:23.738]  How do they get control of the private schools?
[00:39:24.298 --> 00:39:27.140]  How do they get control of the home schools?
[00:39:28.621 --> 00:39:31.944]  In states passing or attempting to pass voucher programs,
[00:39:33.152 --> 00:39:47.041]  It clearly states that if a private school or a home school takes that money, it is then under state and federal regulatory control and jurisdiction.
[00:39:47.862 --> 00:39:51.184]  And so you take hundreds of billions of dollars
[00:39:52.037 --> 00:39:57.765]  And that's the amount that we're talking about yearly just in primary education the first 12 years.
[00:39:57.825 --> 00:40:00.228]  I mean it's hundreds of billions a year at state and federal level.
[00:40:00.649 --> 00:40:06.376]  You take that money and you start taking tens of billions of that and you start, in fact it's already happened with vouchers.
[00:40:07.077 --> 00:40:19.434]  And now the curriculum suddenly changes, the new textbooks come in, the same testing schemes come in, and now the camel's nose isn't under the tent flap of alternative education.
[00:40:20.235 --> 00:40:22.758]  The camel is in the tent and we're on the outside of it.
[00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:27.611]  It's the same thing with faith-based initiative.
[00:40:27.651 --> 00:40:39.038]  The First Amendment clearly states that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of a religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:40:39.398 --> 00:40:44.321]  Congress can't get involved, the executive can't get involved, the courts, they can't touch churches.
[00:40:45.041 --> 00:40:46.022]  It's sanctuary.
[00:40:46.382 --> 00:40:54.225]  I mean, even 500 years ago in England or France, Notre Dame, there in Paris, you ever seen the movie The Hunchback of Notre Dame?
[00:40:54.545 --> 00:40:56.746]  That's fiction, but it's based on true stories.
[00:40:57.086 --> 00:41:01.147]  He goes there, she goes there, sanctuary!
[00:41:01.627 --> 00:41:06.309]  Even a thousand years ago, the state couldn't touch the church.
[00:41:07.049 --> 00:41:08.250]  It's sacrosanct.
[00:41:09.344 --> 00:41:19.007]  I mean, even Hopi Indians out West get to take peyote, the equivalent of naturally occurring LSD, because it's religion.
[00:41:19.107 --> 00:41:20.948]  The state can't touch it.
[00:41:21.408 --> 00:41:22.928]  You cannot touch it.
[00:41:23.269 --> 00:41:24.869]  You cannot First Amendment.
[00:41:24.909 --> 00:41:27.490]  That's how our whole body of law begins.
[00:41:28.766 --> 00:41:29.968]  What does George Bush do?
[00:41:30.028 --> 00:41:31.870]  Mr. Big Government, Mr. U.N.
[00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:44.244]  regulations, Mr. nothing but anti-gun judges, while they'll have some strawman liberal call up and call them an evil right-winger, and all the conservatives run and get conned by it?
[00:41:44.545 --> 00:41:46.307]  Stop getting conned out there!
[00:41:49.281 --> 00:41:58.507]  So, John Stossel and the rest of them get up there and they tell you the truth about how the NEA is a scam, the National Education Association.
[00:41:59.587 --> 00:42:10.654]  They explain how, you know, how dare them in schools in Florida where half the students are flunking, a state law was passed allowing them to get a voucher to go to a good school.
[00:42:10.734 --> 00:42:11.794]  What's wrong with that?
[00:42:11.874 --> 00:42:12.775]  It's racist!
[00:42:13.135 --> 00:42:14.756]  And they show the portal to black kids.
[00:42:15.496 --> 00:42:16.257]  And then, wait a minute,
[00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:25.844]  But their answer is, since the dam broke and this part of the town got flooded, let's blow out the rest of the dams and let the same system take over.
[00:42:26.025 --> 00:42:33.148]  To use John Stossel's analogy of, imagine if grocery stores were all owned by the government and you could only shop at the grocery store in your neighborhood.
[00:42:34.149 --> 00:42:37.730]  Imagine how bad the service and the quality would be with no competition.
[00:42:38.851 --> 00:42:40.172]  Well, let's take it one step further.
[00:42:40.192 --> 00:42:42.533]  The real analogy should be that Stossel's calling for
[00:42:43.567 --> 00:43:01.142]  Is that we have government-owned grocery stores that are horrible and are doing a terrible job, so people are leaving those and they're going and they're paying their own money to go, even though the government's, you know, quote, taking their taxes to give them free food, which is an oxymoron.
[00:43:01.442 --> 00:43:02.323]  You already paid for it.
[00:43:03.038 --> 00:43:13.323]  And so the people are going to the free market grocery stores, and the government is threatened by that, so they're now going to take over the private grocery stores.
[00:43:13.803 --> 00:43:23.168]  Now, see, if John Stossel would have been honest about his analysis and the parallels he drew, then that's the comparison you would have gotten.
[00:43:26.517 --> 00:43:29.279]  See, a lot of this stuff sounds real good.
[00:43:29.319 --> 00:43:35.784]  There's a national talk show host who likes to talk about how he's real wild and wooly, but his real name's Wiener.
[00:43:36.704 --> 00:43:40.527]  And he'll scream and yell and say all the right things for an hour.
[00:43:40.547 --> 00:43:46.111]  And then he'll come back in the next hour and all of his solutions for an hour are the kiss of death.
[00:43:46.632 --> 00:43:49.794]  Sounds real good till you're informed.
[00:43:51.756 --> 00:43:54.297]  Do I think that the children should be going to public school?
[00:43:54.337 --> 00:43:56.538]  Do I think one dime should be going to public school?
[00:43:56.599 --> 00:43:56.839]  No!
[00:43:57.899 --> 00:44:05.163]  Back before the government took over education, bankrupted our economy, bankrupted the family, I've got their handbooks by design.
[00:44:06.663 --> 00:44:10.185]  Back when the CIA hired Gloria Steinem and financed Miss Magazine.
[00:44:10.205 --> 00:44:11.546]  Did you know that's public knowledge?
[00:44:12.193 --> 00:44:19.838]  See the feminist movement, CIA front, not because a bunch of old men at the CIA and their social architects wanted women to quote be empowered.
[00:44:19.938 --> 00:44:20.639]  Oh no, baby.
[00:44:21.239 --> 00:44:36.210]  It was so you could be working in the factories basically as a slave too and so they could double tax everybody and both parents would have to work just to pay the bills so Billy Bob's son and daughter could be raised by the state.
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:40.281]  You see, it's all social engineering.
[00:44:40.641 --> 00:44:43.403]  It's all been done by design.
[00:44:44.483 --> 00:44:45.924]  Now, I've got three audio clips.
[00:44:46.124 --> 00:44:52.726]  One of them is Arlen Specter talking about how George Bush may be impeached.
[00:44:55.128 --> 00:44:58.269]  Impeachment is now being openly discussed.
[00:44:58.329 --> 00:45:00.130]  We'll air that later after we take some calls.
[00:45:01.924 --> 00:45:12.849]  A doctor has ordered one particular young child, I've seen a lot of these reports, to stop playing their Sony PlayStation or to restrict the viewing down to one hour a day.
[00:45:13.489 --> 00:45:14.309]  And why is that?
[00:45:14.409 --> 00:45:24.914]  Because everybody knows that it makes you have seizures and puts you into classical mesmerization.
[00:45:25.859 --> 00:45:27.080]  You are mesmerized.
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:37.505]  And I want to go over the scientific facts of not just what PlayStation does or what Pokemon does, but what television itself does.
[00:45:37.545 --> 00:45:44.568]  I want people to understand that so much of what we talk about is publicly available information.
[00:45:46.029 --> 00:45:52.612]  You know, I make documentary films and I tell people to get them and to watch them on their television sets.
[00:45:53.815 --> 00:45:57.576]  And it's not hypocritical that I then tell folks that they should limit their TV viewing.
[00:45:58.096 --> 00:46:06.239]  I think television should be limited and instructional and I think overall it has its place in a limited theater in human events.
[00:46:06.359 --> 00:46:11.060]  But it is very dangerous and you need to at least be aware of what it is doing.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:20.623]  It actually puts the mind's brainwaves, the brain's waves, into a level lower than sleep.
[00:46:22.105 --> 00:46:25.386]  And I just so happen to have a bunch of mainstream news articles on this today.
[00:46:26.586 --> 00:46:34.368]  And when you are watching television as a child for more than 30 minutes, adults are less suggestible, on average about an hour.
[00:46:34.388 --> 00:46:36.628]  Video games, it's even quicker.
[00:46:36.648 --> 00:46:39.129]  I don't know why this doctor told the kid don't play for more than an hour.
[00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:41.330]  You can shift into it in about five minutes.
[00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:42.970]  I remember playing video games as a youth.
[00:46:44.142 --> 00:46:54.187]  I'm feeling myself go into subconscious mode and I could suddenly beat the game, but I mean literally the amount of concentration it would take to do that, I was just what you'd call in the zone.
[00:46:54.647 --> 00:46:58.109]  The problem is, is that you're not supposed to be in the zone three or four hours a day.
[00:46:58.129 --> 00:47:11.495]  And you know the zone is meant to be, is a natural, oh it gets off into a whole bunch of psychology and physiology and it's a very complex issue, but I have studied it
[00:47:12.882 --> 00:47:14.804]  And boy, believe me, the Pentagon has studied it.
[00:47:14.864 --> 00:47:26.658]  I've talked about how I have a friend who works at a pretty high level at the UT Psychology Department, University of Texas, just a few miles from where I sit.
[00:47:27.059 --> 00:47:29.001]  And I was given actually two tours of it.
[00:47:30.066 --> 00:47:37.209]  Oh, to be frank I was doing some video shooting in there for a drug war film one of my friends is making because it's so interesting looking in there.
[00:47:37.709 --> 00:47:42.731]  You know they'll have like red tile floors, blue tile floors, green tile floors, really weird furniture.
[00:47:44.412 --> 00:47:48.053]  If you've seen the photos on my website, stills from it, it's where I'm in a black suit.
[00:47:48.701 --> 00:47:55.383]  With a black tie and I'm standing in front of like a big sculpture of a woman with puzzle pieces on the wall.
[00:47:55.443 --> 00:47:56.503]  I'm sure you've seen that photo.
[00:47:56.883 --> 00:48:01.265]  That's a video still from video we shot for a documentary that hasn't even been released yet.
[00:48:01.325 --> 00:48:04.946]  But to make a long story short, I'm in that building.
[00:48:06.786 --> 00:48:10.387]  And I said, this is the unclassified areas?
[00:48:10.487 --> 00:48:12.128]  And he said, yeah, most of the building.
[00:48:12.148 --> 00:48:13.008]  I can't let you into.
[00:48:14.466 --> 00:48:31.577]  And it was, outside each laboratory, each classroom, which most of them weren't even classrooms, most of them were just for professors with research funding, it would say DARPA, the Government Defense Laboratories, or Defense Department, or Department of Energy, but most of it was DARPA.
[00:48:32.738 --> 00:48:39.222]  And I would read what, because you'd go in there and there'd be sheets on the wall that would say what the lab was.
[00:48:41.943 --> 00:48:42.243]  I don't know.
[00:48:56.264 --> 00:49:11.490]  But we flicker different frame rates, different flashes, different patterns in front of their eyes, and then measure their brainwaves, and this is for the Defense Department, how to flicker the television set so that, quote, the government can help you better.
[00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:20.294]  We have to flash the TV set better at you so you'll listen to the public service announcement to not mess with Texas or to not drink and drive.
[00:49:20.934 --> 00:49:22.895]  I mean, it's not even hidden, you see.
[00:49:22.995 --> 00:49:26.477]  It's just, oh, we practice how to mind control you in here.
[00:49:26.957 --> 00:49:28.338]  Would you like to see this area?
[00:49:28.658 --> 00:49:38.024]  This is the area where women pleasure themselves while watching porno, and we decide how to manipulate women through arousal centers.
[00:49:38.424 --> 00:49:39.925]  Oh, would you like to see this laboratory?
[00:49:39.965 --> 00:49:43.707]  This is a scanner that retina scans you.
[00:49:45.123 --> 00:49:51.630]  As you walk through the aisles buying cereal, and it follows your eye and knows what you're reading off of a grid.
[00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:54.553]  And then, of course, I'd already read that in the newspaper, that they were studying that.
[00:49:54.573 --> 00:49:58.937]  But here, I mean, it was like each room was some incredible evil.
[00:50:00.019 --> 00:50:00.379]  You see?
[00:50:01.961 --> 00:50:03.382]  So, here's an example.
[00:50:03.402 --> 00:50:04.103]  I'm driving in today.
[00:50:04.143 --> 00:50:06.105]  I hear Gary Brownfield on the Genesis Network.
[00:50:08.277 --> 00:50:14.321]  And he's freaking out reading a bill, that of course we covered six months ago or so, about weather control.
[00:50:14.861 --> 00:50:23.247]  And it's Kay Bailey Hutchinson's, the Senator's bill, and she admits that there are, I think it was what, 49 admitted weather modification programs going on.
[00:50:24.162 --> 00:50:25.383]  Now, weather control.
[00:50:25.743 --> 00:50:31.565]  Now, you tell the average Joe on the street that the government's controlling the weather, or can control it, they'll say it's a conspiracy theory, doesn't exist.
[00:50:31.585 --> 00:50:38.588]  But there's bills introduced that talk about the other weather control projects, and it's declassified in public.
[00:50:39.528 --> 00:50:39.728]  See?
[00:50:40.129 --> 00:50:49.092]  So, see, all we do on this broadcast is talk about things that are admitted, just that haven't gotten a lot of attention.
[00:50:49.372 --> 00:50:52.854]  We'll come right back, I promise, we'll go to Mark, Paul, Bob, Dave,
[00:50:53.661 --> 00:50:55.262]  Keebler and many others, stay with us.
[00:51:01.205 --> 00:51:04.067]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:04.307 --> 00:51:05.868]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:06.228 --> 00:51:10.910]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:11.250 --> 00:51:17.974]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:18.314 --> 00:51:20.276]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:20.496 --> 00:51:23.338]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:23.418 --> 00:51:28.082]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:28.302 --> 00:51:32.685]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:32.946 --> 00:51:40.171]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:40.412 --> 00:51:42.833]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[00:52:00.575 --> 00:52:05.800]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:14.029]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:52:14.289 --> 00:52:21.356]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:52:21.516 --> 00:52:22.777]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[00:52:22.877 --> 00:52:28.781]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:52:28.961 --> 00:52:34.045]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:52:34.165 --> 00:52:43.051]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[00:52:43.311 --> 00:52:46.614]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[00:54:00.055 --> 00:54:01.756]  Welcome back, folks.
[00:54:01.796 --> 00:54:05.338]  We're carrying a great new 9-11 documentary.
[00:54:14.466 --> 00:54:22.794]  I'd seen Loose Change first edition, and it was excellent, but I got Loose Change second edition by Dylan Avery, who we're going to be getting up on the broadcast.
[00:54:23.135 --> 00:54:33.745]  Just some college students, they got together and did a fabulous job, very professional, and really covers it just from the unanswered questions point of view, and really exposes it as an inside job by the end of it.
[00:54:34.807 --> 00:54:42.334]  We're carrying that new DVD, DVD only, for 1995, the new 9-11 film, Loose Change, second edition.
[00:54:42.814 --> 00:54:50.201]  And we have another deal where you get my film, Martial Law, Loose Change, and 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:54:50.722 --> 00:54:55.046]  You get all three of them, and I think you say 1995 when you do that.
[00:54:55.586 --> 00:54:59.510]  And we have another one where you get my new film, The Order of Death, and Loose Change together.
[00:55:00.476 --> 00:55:10.839]  You save $9.95 and on the Order of Death DVD my new film about the occult activities of the global elite and the new footage inside Bohemian Grove shot this July.
[00:55:11.619 --> 00:55:16.020]  With that you get the original Dark Secrets inside Bohemian Grove updated 2005 edition.
[00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:16.660]  So three films.
[00:55:19.101 --> 00:55:21.662]  They're really for the price of one.
[00:55:21.682 --> 00:55:25.044]  It's a lot of new deals at InfoWars.com.
[00:55:25.424 --> 00:55:33.408]  Be sure and go peruse the SafeStore shopping cart or call toll-free to order 1-888-253-3139.
[00:55:34.128 --> 00:55:35.449]  Alright, I had a lot to say today.
[00:55:35.469 --> 00:55:38.630]  Now we're going to take calls throughout the next two plus hours.
[00:55:39.111 --> 00:55:42.512]  And I've got five different audio clips I'm going to be playing.
[00:55:43.053 --> 00:55:43.893]  One on impeachment.
[00:55:44.836 --> 00:56:03.687]  One about PlayStation making you have seizures, your children, it'll make adults have them too, and then a nice piece about the American controlled dictatorship, how our government's controlled, and then I also want to play this little piece about identity fraud, and then show how the government's trying to spin that, and then there's one other, but that's all coming up.
[00:56:04.047 --> 00:56:06.089]  Right now, let's go to Mark in Boston.
[00:56:06.129 --> 00:56:06.729]  Mark, go ahead.
[00:56:06.749 --> 00:56:07.730]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.270]  Good, sir.
[00:56:08.835 --> 00:56:10.256]  Okay, I have a question for you.
[00:56:10.296 --> 00:56:15.977]  First of all, let me preface by saying that I don't believe 9-11 was a inside job.
[00:56:17.178 --> 00:56:19.379]  And my question for you is this.
[00:56:21.039 --> 00:56:26.361]  Given the fact that the planes went in... Well, let me start again.
[00:56:28.902 --> 00:56:32.103]  How could set charges survive
[00:56:33.414 --> 00:56:40.619]  How could the set charges have brought down the buildings at the point where the planes had gone in?
[00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:45.423]  Well, no, there were charges throughout the building.
[00:56:46.484 --> 00:56:51.068]  Well, yeah, but the buildings began to collapse at the point of impact.
[00:56:52.330 --> 00:56:54.432]  Well, that's not actually correct.
[00:56:55.132 --> 00:57:04.640]  There began to be explosions there, but about a second before, squibs, or blast points, down the entire breadth and width of the building.
[00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:06.902]  There were blast points all over the structure.
[00:57:07.522 --> 00:57:09.224]  It was done instantaneously.
[00:57:09.604 --> 00:57:16.890]  But you can see the first blast start in a cascading from the midsection up and down simultaneously.
[00:57:17.290 --> 00:57:19.112]  See, my point is, I would submit that
[00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:26.553]  Let me just stop you for a minute because we have a rule that anybody that disagrees with me goes to the front of the line.
[00:57:26.613 --> 00:57:29.274]  You didn't tell the folks answering the phone you disagreed, did you?
[00:57:30.174 --> 00:57:31.815]  No, well actually I wasn't asking.
[00:57:32.135 --> 00:57:33.516]  I was simply asking.
[00:57:33.576 --> 00:57:34.996]  No, no, we don't screen calls.
[00:57:35.056 --> 00:57:37.917]  We ask what your name is, first name, where you're calling from.
[00:57:38.018 --> 00:57:39.378]  If you don't want to tell us, you don't have to.
[00:57:39.938 --> 00:57:43.320]  My point is, sir, you get special treatment when you disagree.
[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:45.621]  So now you're going to get special treatment.
[00:57:46.321 --> 00:57:47.361]  I meant to give you two minutes.
[00:57:47.381 --> 00:57:48.562]  I thought you were a regular caller.
[00:57:48.962 --> 00:57:54.247]  We're going to have to hold you over and lavish you with time in the next segment and the next.
[00:57:54.287 --> 00:57:55.788]  Let's spend some time together.
[00:57:56.108 --> 00:57:59.411]  I'm sorry to the other callers, Paul and Bob and Dave and many others.
[00:57:59.431 --> 00:58:06.217]  We're going to get to you too, but Mark's going to need to be supported here with more time.
[00:58:06.758 --> 00:58:09.700]  Let me hear what you have to say when we get back from break, okay?
[00:58:10.801 --> 00:58:12.021]  But you got about 30 seconds right now.
[00:58:12.081 --> 00:58:13.182]  Keep telling me how I'm wrong.
[00:58:13.222 --> 00:58:13.502]  Go ahead.
[00:58:14.002 --> 00:58:21.904]  Well, just very quickly, the force of the plane, the impact of the explosion, I don't believe squids could survive that impact.
[00:58:23.685 --> 00:58:25.946]  Well, squibs aren't the charges.
[00:58:26.026 --> 00:58:28.346]  Squibs are the classical blast points.
[00:58:29.487 --> 00:58:35.328]  Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise that we are made to think that someone else did it.
[00:58:35.769 --> 00:58:36.549]  Why don't you stay there?
[00:58:36.589 --> 00:58:37.169]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:39.719 --> 00:58:44.323]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:44.343 --> 00:58:44.543]  Hello!
[00:58:44.583 --> 00:58:45.103]  Big Brother.
[00:58:45.123 --> 00:58:45.824]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:45.864 --> 00:58:50.367]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:51.548 --> 00:58:53.709]  You want answers?
[00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:55.491]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.247 --> 00:59:08.210]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:08.411 --> 00:59:12.554]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:13.635 --> 00:59:18.779]  Well, old Magic Bullet Specter himself, yeah, he came up with the Warren Commission Magic Bullet Theory.
[00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:25.324]  He's even talking about impeachment now, of Lord Bush, and quite frankly, I'm against it.
[00:59:26.065 --> 00:59:30.969]  I mean, I don't care if Bush gets impeached, but I'm not going to put my energy into it, because the guy is just a puppet.
[00:59:31.741 --> 00:59:32.742]  And he won't get impeached.
[00:59:32.782 --> 00:59:35.403]  They all need to go to jail, including Bill Clinton, who he's been protecting.
[00:59:35.844 --> 00:59:39.846]  We've got a lot of new torture news, Iraq news, the Iran invasion news is really serious.
[00:59:39.866 --> 00:59:40.447]  We'll get into that.
[00:59:40.467 --> 00:59:42.528]  A lot of the new spying info.
[00:59:42.548 --> 00:59:47.511]  We've got two hours left, and we're trying to take your calls here, Paul, Bob, Dave, Jeff, many others.
[00:59:48.251 --> 00:59:53.995]  Mark in Boston called, and he just says he doesn't believe the inside job, quote, theory.
[00:59:55.089 --> 01:00:02.653]  And he thinks that the planes crashing into the two buildings, if there were bombs around them, that those would have been damaged and wouldn't have gone off.
[01:00:02.693 --> 01:00:07.076]  Number one, plastic explosive is very sturdy and very strong.
[01:00:07.096 --> 01:00:10.998]  Number two, there were blast points up and down the entire length of the building.
[01:00:11.704 --> 01:00:12.944]  Squibs began to blast.
[01:00:12.984 --> 01:00:14.165]  Squibs are blast points.
[01:00:14.665 --> 01:00:16.505]  Ejection ports from the explosions.
[01:00:17.046 --> 01:00:19.306]  And we have underwriter laboratories.
[01:00:19.346 --> 01:00:21.347]  The chief guy that looked at it said it had to be bombs.
[01:00:21.627 --> 01:00:23.628]  The firefighting union said it had to be bombs.
[01:00:23.688 --> 01:00:26.268]  Firefighters Association said it was a cover-up.
[01:00:27.409 --> 01:00:30.390]  The head of the New Mexico Mining University said it.
[01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:35.711]  The top physicist in construction and demolition.
[01:00:35.731 --> 01:00:36.532]  Done studies in that.
[01:00:36.852 --> 01:00:37.592]  Brigham Young.
[01:00:38.572 --> 01:00:42.373]  On and on and on, the witnesses, the seismographs, all of it.
[01:00:42.673 --> 01:00:44.253]  But that doesn't seem to matter to Mark.
[01:00:44.293 --> 01:00:48.474]  He just has an opinion that there weren't bombs in those buildings.
[01:00:48.494 --> 01:00:49.135]  Go ahead, Mark.
[01:00:50.015 --> 01:00:50.655]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:00:50.695 --> 01:00:58.837]  I mean, my point is a very simple one on that one, and that is that sturdy plastic or not, a couple of 757s going into a building,
[01:01:01.053 --> 01:01:04.276]  I don't see how the squids could possibly have survived that kind of impact.
[01:01:04.376 --> 01:01:14.583]  The plastic explosive wouldn't have survived, but people would stand in the wounds in the sides of the building and right where the planes had hit, they'd be just fine.
[01:01:14.803 --> 01:01:19.886]  But boy, those plastic explosives, ten floors down or ten floors up, they just couldn't survive.
[01:01:20.326 --> 01:01:25.090]  Well, of course, nobody in the direct area of the impact zone survived.
[01:01:25.110 --> 01:01:30.053]  Those are people who presumably were coming down or upwards from other floors.
[01:01:30.757 --> 01:01:36.478]  Well, I don't think anyone's saying that bombs directly in the impact zone survive.
[01:01:36.498 --> 01:01:39.539]  What we're telling you, sir, is that the bombs went off all over the building.
[01:01:40.099 --> 01:01:41.739]  That's what a controlled demo does.
[01:01:41.759 --> 01:01:48.801]  Sure, but... You have to blow each section apart so it falls in a neat pile.
[01:01:49.061 --> 01:01:49.941]  And in fact, what about Building 7?
[01:01:50.301 --> 01:01:51.182]  Was it hit by a plane?
[01:01:51.222 --> 01:01:52.702]  Was it hit by Tower 1 or 2?
[01:01:52.742 --> 01:01:54.382]  Was it hit by the North Tower?
[01:01:54.402 --> 01:01:55.863]  It has a few small fires in it.
[01:01:56.143 --> 01:01:57.183]  Perfectly implodes.
[01:01:57.987 --> 01:02:00.729]  Squibb, uh, ejection points as well, blast points?
[01:02:01.669 --> 01:02:09.854]  Well, uh, actually, uh, building number seven, I have yet to actually read the, uh, NIST report, so I really don't know what their theory is on that, but I'm going back to the tip two.
[01:02:09.874 --> 01:02:11.094]  Well, let me ask you more questions.
[01:02:11.134 --> 01:02:13.216]  Hold on, we can go back and forth there for a while if we need to.
[01:02:13.236 --> 01:02:13.876]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:02:14.964 --> 01:02:20.208]  Do you deny that the White House called Mayor Willie Brown of San Francisco and told him not to fly to New York that day the night before?
[01:02:20.668 --> 01:02:22.250]  Well, I don't know exactly who it was who called.
[01:02:22.410 --> 01:02:25.732]  Do you deny that the high-level Pentagon brass canceled their trip?
[01:02:25.752 --> 01:02:27.754]  Do you deny that NORAB was ordered to stand down?
[01:02:28.054 --> 01:02:30.356]  Do you deny that Bin Laden's a known CIA asset?
[01:02:30.376 --> 01:02:33.118]  Do you deny that the so-called hijackers were trained at U.S.
[01:02:33.138 --> 01:02:38.602]  military bases, including the Defense Language School at Monterey, California, and the Dean of the School's gone public and said the U.S.
[01:02:38.642 --> 01:02:42.305]  government carried out the attacks and that he was forced to train hijackers?
[01:02:42.899 --> 01:02:44.300]  Well, Bin Laden was only a CIA agent.
[01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:46.000]  Yeah, that's right, that's right, that's right.
[01:02:46.041 --> 01:02:57.786]  Let's ignore the Dean of the Defense Language School who was in the San Jose Mercury News and told to shut up two months after 9-11 said it was an inside job and that he was forced to train hijackers.
[01:02:58.346 --> 01:03:01.087]  Why were these hijackers in all these super spy schools?
[01:03:02.108 --> 01:03:10.832]  Maybe because they just accidentally fell into them because they were friendly with the chocolate bunny quick or something?
[01:03:11.573 --> 01:03:20.395]  Well, Alex, I say to remember that when you were a part of the George Norris Roundtable, you specifically said that you don't believe that the hijackers flew those planes into buildings.
[01:03:20.455 --> 01:03:21.856]  Now you're talking about hijackers.
[01:03:22.136 --> 01:03:26.797]  No, I said they were government operatives taking part in a drill and were killed.
[01:03:27.857 --> 01:03:29.717]  It isn't my opinion they were U.S.
[01:03:29.737 --> 01:03:30.498]  government agents.
[01:03:31.238 --> 01:03:31.838]  Only U.S.
[01:03:31.858 --> 01:03:39.700]  government agents or high-level operatives or assets get trained at the Defense Language School or the Pensacola Naval Air Station.
[01:03:41.087 --> 01:03:41.708]  Just stay there.
[01:03:41.748 --> 01:03:45.855]  I mean, you just... Listen, your opinion doesn't change the universe.
[01:03:46.135 --> 01:03:50.663]  Just because you are too afraid to admit the facts doesn't change them, Bubba!
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:53.402]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:53.602 --> 01:03:56.685]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:56.805 --> 01:04:00.729]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:00.769 --> 01:04:04.994]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:04:05.354 --> 01:04:09.118]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:09.258 --> 01:04:11.060]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:14.562]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[01:04:14.602 --> 01:04:19.305]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:19.465 --> 01:04:22.506]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:22.686 --> 01:04:25.568]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:26.048 --> 01:04:32.152]  The neighbors in that area, Sandpoint Naval Air Station, were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:32.692 --> 01:04:36.475]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[01:04:36.875 --> 01:04:38.256]  Order your video today.
[01:04:38.636 --> 01:04:39.637]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[01:04:39.697 --> 01:04:41.938]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[01:04:41.998 --> 01:04:43.239]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[01:04:51.658 --> 01:04:53.279]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:04:53.399 --> 01:04:57.521]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:04:57.642 --> 01:05:00.523]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:05:00.603 --> 01:05:07.327]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:05:07.507 --> 01:05:10.509]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:05:10.709 --> 01:05:13.111]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:05:13.231 --> 01:05:18.774]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethyl
[01:05:18.954 --> 01:05:19.615]  We're good to go!
[01:05:48.834 --> 01:05:49.098]  I think so.
[01:05:52.039 --> 01:05:54.920]  We continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease.
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:06:03.463]  When natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach, hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:06:03.783 --> 01:06:11.686]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:06:11.846 --> 01:06:18.888]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:06:19.108 --> 01:06:20.329]  There are no side effects.
[01:06:20.469 --> 01:06:23.872]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:06:23.912 --> 01:06:25.033]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:06:25.334 --> 01:06:26.595]  Eliminate the cause.
[01:06:26.795 --> 01:06:33.641]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:06:33.761 --> 01:06:36.203]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:06:36.383 --> 01:06:39.305]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free, 866-885-6625.
[01:06:39.325 --> 01:06:39.366]  866-885-6625.
[01:06:39.386 --> 01:06:40.406]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:06:40.466 --> 01:06:43.689]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:15.743]  I'm going to try to give our caller Mark from Boston a few more minutes, then we'll get to your other calls and get into talk of impeachment of Bush, what's happening with the open borders, a bunch of new big developments there, what's happening with the spying on the American people, and more important than all of that is this Iran situation.
[01:07:15.763 --> 01:07:20.304]  They're really getting up for war on both sides, and it is very serious.
[01:07:20.824 --> 01:07:21.904]  This is not Iraq.
[01:07:21.944 --> 01:07:22.824]  And Iraq is serious.
[01:07:22.844 --> 01:07:23.884]  Look what that's turned into.
[01:07:25.025 --> 01:07:26.365]  Just as the experts said it would.
[01:07:27.594 --> 01:07:28.679]  You know, Mark, I'm confused.
[01:07:28.699 --> 01:07:31.711]  You call in and you say, I don't think that 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:07:34.051 --> 01:07:35.472]  And then you don't have any evidence of that.
[01:07:35.512 --> 01:07:44.539]  You just say you think planes hitting the buildings would have knocked out any explosives, but it didn't knock out people two floors below where the planes hit or two floors above.
[01:07:44.579 --> 01:07:47.120]  And clearly there were bombs up and down those buildings.
[01:07:47.161 --> 01:07:48.141]  We have the blast points.
[01:07:48.161 --> 01:07:49.082]  We have the seismographs.
[01:07:49.102 --> 01:07:49.762]  We have the evidence.
[01:07:50.123 --> 01:07:51.023]  We have the firefighters.
[01:07:51.043 --> 01:07:52.424]  We have the underwriting laboratories.
[01:07:52.845 --> 01:07:53.805]  We have all the evidence.
[01:07:53.825 --> 01:07:54.826]  We have the common sense.
[01:07:55.647 --> 01:07:58.349]  We have the designers saying it could take two jumbo jets.
[01:07:58.369 --> 01:08:00.150]  We have Building 7 not being hit by anything.
[01:08:01.727 --> 01:08:18.199]  Then we have all the public officials being warned not to fly, NORAD standing down, and then I talk about how the supposed hijackers were trained at the Defense Language School at Monterey, California as spies, and how the dean went public and said, they were even in my classes!
[01:08:18.259 --> 01:08:19.340]  These were government ops!
[01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:26.034]  I've had on the embassy heads who, they'd be coming back into the U.S., say out of Saudi Arabia, and they'd go, these are known terrorists.
[01:08:26.054 --> 01:08:28.255]  They'd go, let them in, it's part of an anti-terror operation.
[01:08:28.496 --> 01:08:29.976]  These are our deep cover operatives.
[01:08:30.137 --> 01:08:30.937]  Because they were!
[01:08:30.957 --> 01:08:36.941]  Or, MSNBC, Pensacola News Journal, hijackers, quote, trained at the military base.
[01:08:36.961 --> 01:08:44.806]  And then they went out and created the ledger, or the history, you know, at the different private flight schools in the Cessnas.
[01:08:45.871 --> 01:08:47.433]  You went through a lot of information there.
[01:08:47.513 --> 01:08:51.638]  It would take a long time to debunk them all, but as far as the Pensacola... You can't... No, no, hold on a second.
[01:08:51.658 --> 01:08:54.361]  Don't claim you can debunk it and then not debunk it.
[01:08:54.401 --> 01:08:55.161]  Go ahead and try.
[01:08:55.382 --> 01:09:02.109]  Well, as far as the Pensacola News Journal that released the information that they might have been trained at military air schools, I heard...
[01:09:03.467 --> 01:09:10.053]  Oh, I forget the gentleman's name, but I think that very publication issued a retraction on that the following day.
[01:09:10.174 --> 01:09:17.260]  Sir, we're on in Pensacola right now, and I assure you that at least three of the hijackers did train there.
[01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:22.786]  They quote made a mistake on one, and then a fellow with the exact same name as one of the hijackers
[01:09:23.406 --> 01:09:29.389]  The exact same person, last name, who was a trainer, a Saudi Arabian trainer, training other Saads, guess what?
[01:09:29.429 --> 01:09:31.590]  He crashed and died a week later.
[01:09:31.830 --> 01:09:33.971]  But you go ahead and finish up what you have to say.
[01:09:34.451 --> 01:09:35.072]  Okay.
[01:09:35.112 --> 01:09:35.452]  Very good.
[01:09:35.812 --> 01:09:37.333]  Well, um... Very good.
[01:09:37.373 --> 01:09:38.574]  Let me ask you, what do you do?
[01:09:38.614 --> 01:09:39.394]  No, no, no.
[01:09:39.434 --> 01:09:40.655]  Let me ask you, what do you do for a living?
[01:09:40.675 --> 01:09:41.215]  I'm just interested.
[01:09:42.055 --> 01:09:43.776]  Actually, I work at the New England Aquarium.
[01:09:44.877 --> 01:09:45.237]  Interesting.
[01:09:45.277 --> 01:09:48.038]  Oh, what kind of, uh, what kind of fishy wishes you got in there?
[01:09:48.618 --> 01:09:49.039]  I'm sorry?
[01:09:49.499 --> 01:09:50.920]  What kind of fish do you have in there?
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:51.720]  That's very funny.
[01:09:55.972 --> 01:09:57.435]  You said you work at the New England Aquarium.
[01:09:57.635 --> 01:09:57.975]  That's right.
[01:09:58.436 --> 01:09:59.097]  Is it a nice one?
[01:09:59.117 --> 01:09:59.858]  I like aquariums.
[01:10:00.419 --> 01:10:02.162]  It's very good, but I'd like to get back to 9-11.
[01:10:02.242 --> 01:10:04.446]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:10:04.746 --> 01:10:06.469]  Are you aware of Operation Northwoods?
[01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:08.432]  As a matter of fact I am.
[01:10:09.459 --> 01:10:09.599]  Oh!
[01:10:09.959 --> 01:10:11.260]  And I suppose that isn't a U.S.
[01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:14.161]  government plan to carry out terror attacks against our people?
[01:10:14.181 --> 01:10:15.042]  Hmm?
[01:10:15.182 --> 01:10:17.463]  I don't know, but what does Operation Northwest have to do with 9-1-1?
[01:10:17.643 --> 01:10:18.743]  Oh, what is a U.S.
[01:10:18.783 --> 01:10:21.124]  government plan that they tried to get executed?
[01:10:21.184 --> 01:10:34.550]  Not just an operational battle plan, or not just some war game, but a plan they tried to carry out, a real operation, to hijack jets by remote control and crash them, and to bomb D.C., and to kill Marines, and blame it on foreign armies, and
[01:10:35.411 --> 01:10:37.733]  And have fake sniper attacks in D.C.
[01:10:37.793 --> 01:10:39.274]  and out-of-frame patsies?
[01:10:39.334 --> 01:10:40.535]  That doesn't matter, does it?
[01:10:40.775 --> 01:10:43.158]  Or the Gulf of Tonkin being totally declassified.
[01:10:43.178 --> 01:10:45.980]  We knew this 40 years ago, but now totally declassified.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.022]  1964 totally staged.
[01:10:48.222 --> 01:10:49.363]  What about the USS Liberty?
[01:10:49.523 --> 01:10:59.072]  You know, I've had Admiral Moore, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff on, to say that our government, with Israel, carried out that attack to try to blame it on Egypt to start World War III.
[01:10:59.092 --> 01:11:01.174]  Oh, what about the NATO option?
[01:11:01.394 --> 01:11:02.916]  What about the Salvadoran option?
[01:11:03.276 --> 01:11:15.071]  Oh, what about Operation Gladio, 130-plus bombings that our government carried out blowing up school buses in schools and movie theaters in Europe during the 1970s until 1980 to blame it on leftists?
[01:11:15.311 --> 01:11:16.353]  What about that, hmm?
[01:11:16.813 --> 01:11:18.574]  Come on, keep trying to deny it!
[01:11:18.714 --> 01:11:19.755]  What about Mosedeck?
[01:11:19.975 --> 01:11:27.260]  I had two high-level CIA officers on two weeks ago, and I said, did our government carry out terror attacks in Iran and blame it on Mosedeck?
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:29.701]  And their answer was, yes, they did!
[01:11:29.881 --> 01:11:32.223]  So what is your major malfunction?
[01:11:32.423 --> 01:11:33.724]  Why are you in denial?
[01:11:33.844 --> 01:11:35.725]  Have you heard about the FEMA camps on the news?
[01:11:35.865 --> 01:11:37.586]  Have you heard about martial law on the news?
[01:11:37.746 --> 01:11:39.647]  Have you heard about the foreign troops on the news?
[01:11:39.867 --> 01:11:42.149]  Have you heard about how they're spying on us in the news?
[01:11:42.449 --> 01:11:43.389]  Have you heard, buddy?
[01:11:43.569 --> 01:11:44.770]  Are you awake?
[01:11:45.090 --> 01:11:47.351]  I bet you think you're a conservative, don't you?
[01:11:47.531 --> 01:11:49.651]  I bet you think Bush is a conservative, don't you?
[01:11:50.352 --> 01:11:55.073]  Well, let's go back to... Let's go back to you being a spineless jellyfish!
[01:11:55.333 --> 01:11:55.493]  Right.
[01:11:55.533 --> 01:11:57.994]  Well, let's go back to Operation Northwood and Gladio.
[01:11:58.354 --> 01:12:06.537]  The only value of those arguments, really, is if somebody was to say that outright 9-11 impossibly could not be an inside job.
[01:12:06.617 --> 01:12:07.277]  I don't say that.
[01:12:07.357 --> 01:12:09.278]  I don't say that it impossibly could not.
[01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:14.863]  The only value of those arguments is that it allows for the possibility.
[01:12:14.923 --> 01:12:18.786]  Historically, these things have happened in the past, and so it allows for the possibility present.
[01:12:19.927 --> 01:12:25.992]  And then we look at motive, who has the motive, and we look at all the evidence, and oh, lo and behold, it points right at who has the motive!
[01:12:26.172 --> 01:12:35.019]  And all the evidence stacks up there, and the official story is an impossible fairy tale, but the information I have that comes from the Pentagon, oh yeah, it fits exactly!
[01:12:35.399 --> 01:12:36.260]  Oh, how unusual!
[01:12:38.181 --> 01:12:48.406]  Yes, there's been a debunking story written by Michael Chertoff's first cousin saying that isn't true when it is.
[01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:57.410]  You want to talk to me about Michael Chertoff now?
[01:12:57.930 --> 01:13:03.193]  About how his family writes hit pieces on me with straw men with made up baloney that we never said?
[01:13:04.059 --> 01:13:05.099]  Is that what you want to talk about?
[01:13:05.259 --> 01:13:06.239]  I'm trying to make a point here.
[01:13:06.259 --> 01:13:07.820]  Why are you afraid to listen to my point?
[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:08.300]  I'm not.
[01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:09.360]  You made me sick.
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:10.080]  That's why.
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:11.520]  Because my life's on the line.
[01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:13.061]  I know the country's going down.
[01:13:13.101 --> 01:13:14.041]  I know we're in deep trouble.
[01:13:14.261 --> 01:13:16.221]  I know the dollar's plunging in value.
[01:13:16.441 --> 01:13:18.201]  I know the Chinese are dumping the dollar.
[01:13:18.421 --> 01:13:20.282]  I know they're planning to take our pension funds.
[01:13:20.442 --> 01:13:21.522]  Because they said they are.
[01:13:22.062 --> 01:13:23.102]  I'm freaked out.
[01:13:23.322 --> 01:13:25.843]  Do you deny that America's turning into a police state?
[01:13:26.003 --> 01:13:28.603]  I want to get this point out of this.
[01:13:29.183 --> 01:13:30.644]  I want to get your mindset on this.
[01:13:30.864 --> 01:13:32.804]  Do you think America's becoming a police state?
[01:13:33.610 --> 01:13:36.512]  I'm going to, listen, I'm going to get this point whether you like it or not.
[01:13:36.552 --> 01:13:37.293]  You're a jellyfish.
[01:13:37.333 --> 01:13:45.859]  As far as the seismographic records go, you yourself said on that George Nord program that you thought the evidence was at least debatable.
[01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:49.922]  And now you want to prop it up as if it's absolutely conclusive.
[01:13:50.242 --> 01:13:51.103]  I don't remember saying that.
[01:13:51.563 --> 01:13:52.303]  I got it on tape.
[01:13:52.323 --> 01:13:53.564]  You can go back and listen to it.
[01:13:53.584 --> 01:13:54.105]  Okay, great.
[01:13:54.385 --> 01:13:55.726]  Listen, Bubba, thanks for the call.
[01:13:55.766 --> 01:13:56.747]  I really appreciate it.
[01:13:58.748 --> 01:14:00.009]  So, let's say I'm a cop.
[01:14:00.089 --> 01:14:01.470]  I'm a police detective.
[01:14:02.478 --> 01:14:29.891]  and somebody is stealing Porsche 911's and I look into my files and I see that a perp got out of jail who is a master thief and steals basically a 911 Porsche 365 days a year and he will clean out multiple cities every year that he's out of jail and there's no Porsche 911's being stolen
[01:14:31.232 --> 01:14:38.375]  But a week after this guy gets out of prison, suddenly Porsche 911's, let's say we live in Dallas, start getting stolen.
[01:14:38.955 --> 01:14:41.997]  Vintage, brand new ones, late model, whatever.
[01:14:42.037 --> 01:14:44.958]  Just Porsche 911's or Porsches across the board.
[01:14:45.478 --> 01:14:47.939]  Porsches, Porsches everywhere are being stolen.
[01:14:47.979 --> 01:14:48.979]  It's the same MO.
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:51.581]  He's stealing them out of country club parking lots.
[01:14:51.621 --> 01:14:54.102]  He's stealing them out of garages.
[01:14:56.090 --> 01:15:08.446]  Now, I'm just gonna randomly, as a cop, I'm just gonna go, and I'm just gonna randomly go search a, say, a hamburger shop, and just make everybody line up outside, I'm gonna search them, and go through their stuff.
[01:15:08.546 --> 01:15:10.109]  No, I'm gonna go to the house,
[01:15:11.394 --> 01:15:20.896]  Of the individual who's out on parole, who steals Porsche 911s, and I'm going to put a tail on him, and we're going to follow him, and we're going to catch him when he walks up and starts stealing a Porsche 911.
[01:15:20.976 --> 01:15:28.538]  I mean, we have a government, over and over and over again, that admittedly has carried out terror attacks, or planned to carry them out.
[01:15:28.558 --> 01:15:32.478]  I mean, most people go, well, at least in the past, well, why would the government do that?
[01:15:32.759 --> 01:15:34.779]  To get us to go along with their program of control.
[01:15:35.119 --> 01:15:37.279]  I just don't see why, why, why?
[01:15:37.499 --> 01:15:38.440]  They just can't get it.
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:39.880]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[01:15:41.807 --> 01:15:42.527]  I mean, it's simple.
[01:15:43.568 --> 01:15:49.009]  It's like the mafia will come threaten to burn down your grocery store if you don't pay them protection money.
[01:15:50.350 --> 01:15:53.471]  And, of course, when the mafia comes and does it, they go, you know, this is a rough neighborhood.
[01:15:53.531 --> 01:15:55.892]  I'm going to protect you from somebody who might burn it down.
[01:15:56.152 --> 01:15:58.492]  You better pay me to protect you or they'll burn it down.
[01:15:58.773 --> 01:16:04.654]  Well, any idiot knows that the person they're threatening that somebody will burn it down is the person that's going to give the order to burn it down.
[01:16:04.914 --> 01:16:09.376]  But everybody knows that person is just going to out loud say, I'm going to burn down your grocery store.
[01:16:09.916 --> 01:16:21.705]  The government is saying, if you don't let us totally run your life, and take your pension funds, and turn America into a police state, and put your kids in prisons, building widgets for us, in these run-for-profit prisons, then the terrorists are going to get you.
[01:16:21.825 --> 01:16:23.706]  They're going to burn down your grocery store.
[01:16:25.227 --> 01:16:28.630]  I mean, look at, and the reason I got mad at you, sir, because this is real to me.
[01:16:28.730 --> 01:16:29.971]  I'm freaked out about this.
[01:16:30.651 --> 01:16:34.154]  You know, you are just cynically, have your view that none of this is real,
[01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:36.161]  You just can't believe it.
[01:16:36.641 --> 01:16:39.544]  And so I go, okay, our government carried out terror attacks in Iran.
[01:16:39.564 --> 01:16:40.364]  Blame it on the government.
[01:16:41.345 --> 01:16:41.825]  So what?
[01:16:42.606 --> 01:16:44.948]  Our government admittedly did this with the USS Liberty.
[01:16:45.228 --> 01:16:45.749]  So what?
[01:16:46.209 --> 01:16:47.730]  Our government staged the Gulf of Tonkin.
[01:16:47.810 --> 01:16:48.331]  So what?
[01:16:48.451 --> 01:16:52.834]  Our government had Northwoods planning 9-11 attacks right down to what, you know, basically what happened.
[01:16:54.275 --> 01:16:54.836]  You don't care.
[01:16:55.056 --> 01:16:55.736]  You don't want to hear it.
[01:16:56.817 --> 01:16:58.298]  So that's why I got mad at you.
[01:16:59.119 --> 01:17:00.440]  Because you're just not listening.
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:02.602]  And you go, all that proves is the government
[01:17:04.398 --> 01:17:05.559]  Alex, man, listen, I'll be very brief.
[01:17:05.599 --> 01:17:14.264]  I'm so glad I get to go on after a fool like that, and I say that respectfully, but I think the same reason you get mad at me, too.
[01:17:14.284 --> 01:17:16.645]  He represents what is, if we don't
[01:17:28.408 --> 01:17:31.129]  He represents a whole lot of what's wrong with this nation.
[01:17:31.390 --> 01:17:34.191]  Here we are looking at a forest of evidence for 10 years.
[01:17:34.251 --> 01:17:35.232]  I'm a former Marine.
[01:17:35.272 --> 01:17:35.952]  I've been listening.
[01:17:35.992 --> 01:17:36.792]  I've been studying.
[01:17:37.092 --> 01:17:42.135]  And he's going to talk about one little small thing that he really didn't even know what he was talking about.
[01:17:42.535 --> 01:17:44.876]  I just want to tell you, sir, I respect you.
[01:17:44.896 --> 01:17:45.837]  I always have.
[01:17:46.757 --> 01:17:49.139]  I'm out here on the front lines trying to wake people up.
[01:17:49.699 --> 01:17:51.320]  And don't let that get you down.
[01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:57.923]  I respectfully would like to say, too, I vote that you don't take callers first anymore that disagree with you.
[01:17:58.345 --> 01:18:00.426]  Because what do they have with everything?
[01:18:00.486 --> 01:18:02.828]  And I know why you want to do that, to be fair.
[01:18:03.248 --> 01:18:08.512]  But I mean, brother, the things that you give as medicine to us, it puts us in the right direction.
[01:18:08.532 --> 01:18:14.896]  So, in closing, I just wanted to offer, um, have you talked to Ray McGovern lately?
[01:18:14.936 --> 01:18:19.559]  Do you know anything about what he's doing with this Veterans Intelligence Professionals for Sanity?
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:24.723]  We've been having Ray on for about three years, ever since he went public, and he was the main advisor to, uh,
[01:18:25.541 --> 01:18:32.204]  Ronald Reagan and Bush Senior every morning and he says the government has been behind terror in the past and may carry out more terror attacks.
[01:18:32.604 --> 01:18:39.967]  So does Paul Craig Roberts, number two Treasury, so does Morgan Reynolds, number two Department of Labor.
[01:18:40.747 --> 01:18:41.888]  So do all these people.
[01:18:41.948 --> 01:18:44.929]  Michael Meacher, the German Defense Minister, Andres von Bülow.
[01:18:45.209 --> 01:18:46.229]  Anything else you want to add?
[01:18:46.249 --> 01:18:47.370]  I have one question.
[01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:48.870]  Stay there Paul, you've been holding long enough.
[01:18:48.930 --> 01:18:49.851]  I'm going to let you finish.
[01:18:49.871 --> 01:18:50.231]  Stay with us.
[01:18:54.397 --> 01:18:56.039]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:56.639 --> 01:18:58.440]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:18:59.561 --> 01:19:07.446]  The best-kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:07.686 --> 01:19:10.308]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Inc.'
[01:19:10.288 --> 01:19:11.709]  's patented methodology.

[01:22:11.329 --> 01:22:15.012]  I was feeling chest pain from time to time, shortness of breath.
[01:22:15.172 --> 01:22:19.016]  I don't have the tightness on my chest, and I don't have that shortness of breath no more.
[01:22:19.236 --> 01:22:20.417]  I tried all kinds of junk.
[01:22:20.617 --> 01:22:21.138]  It didn't do.
[01:22:21.218 --> 01:22:23.239]  The only thing that worked was your Cardivite.

[01:22:54.425 --> 01:23:00.449]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:23:01.070 --> 01:23:04.052]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:05.884 --> 01:23:14.350]  You know, I talked to my crew here at the office, here at the studio, about that last caller, Mark, in Boston, and maybe I should have even let him be on longer, more rope to hang himself.
[01:23:14.391 --> 01:23:16.192]  Everything he was saying was so ridiculous.
[01:23:16.212 --> 01:23:21.416]  I mean, I list a laundry list of this criminal government, the criminal group that's taken over our government.
[01:23:21.436 --> 01:23:22.697]  It's not even our government.
[01:23:23.137 --> 01:23:30.102]  Very small group of that involve in terror attacks, admittedly, and his answer is just, uh, whatever.
[01:23:30.757 --> 01:23:32.037]  And it just made me really mad.
[01:23:32.077 --> 01:23:32.918]  It makes me mad.
[01:23:33.418 --> 01:23:37.779]  So I should have let the guy, well I had him on for like three segments, but I should have let him even say more.
[01:23:37.839 --> 01:23:39.560]  So you can call back again sometime, Mark.
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:40.320]  I'd love to hear from you.
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.201]  Paul in Austin and Bob, Dave, Jeff, Steve and others.
[01:23:43.421 --> 01:23:44.541]  Paul, go ahead and ask your question.
[01:23:45.221 --> 01:23:59.206]  Well, Alex, with what you said earlier, too, about we have to start thinking outside the box, along with everything we're doing, getting the CDs, DVDs out, what do you see with the people that take something that seems drastic to motivate them?
[01:23:59.266 --> 01:24:00.466]  They're like deer in the headlight.
[01:24:01.277 --> 01:24:05.740]  What do you envision that we could do to try to make a big chunk of this turn around?
[01:24:06.481 --> 01:24:07.481]  And I'll let you go with that.
[01:24:07.501 --> 01:24:08.982]  I know you don't have all the answers, brother.
[01:24:09.002 --> 01:24:10.243]  I'm not trying to put it on you.
[01:24:10.303 --> 01:24:13.566]  I just want to see what your vision is here in the coming near future.
[01:24:13.626 --> 01:24:15.007]  Now, Harry, I appreciate the call.
[01:24:15.487 --> 01:24:29.617]  Really, it's just realizing, relearning what America's all about, rediscovering the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, getting angry when you're ordered around by bureaucrats, getting angry when you're getting taxed, getting angry when you're being lied to.
[01:24:30.678 --> 01:24:42.794]  Shifting our paradigms, getting involved in local politics, getting involved at the county and state and city level, focusing more on local elections instead of federal ones, which are pretty much bought and paid for.
[01:24:42.814 --> 01:24:44.977]  I mean, there's so many facets to that.
[01:24:45.017 --> 01:24:45.918]  We talk about drastic.
[01:24:48.171 --> 01:24:51.053]  Just start talking the talk, walking the walks.
[01:24:51.553 --> 01:24:54.135]  Sponsor my radio show locally in your area.
[01:24:55.075 --> 01:24:55.816]  It's on the radio.
[01:24:55.996 --> 01:24:56.796]  Call those stations.
[01:24:56.836 --> 01:24:57.737]  Thank them for carrying it.
[01:24:58.177 --> 01:24:59.638]  Tell them to carry more of the broadcast.
[01:24:59.658 --> 01:25:01.339]  Tell them to carry other similar programming.
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:03.780]  It's a process.
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:04.961]  Put up your own website.
[01:25:05.001 --> 01:25:06.022]  Start your own newsletter.
[01:25:06.362 --> 01:25:07.162]  It's a process.
[01:25:07.182 --> 01:25:08.883]  There are no easy, quick fixes.
[01:25:09.464 --> 01:25:13.006]  It's relearning things that we've forgotten.
[01:25:13.856 --> 01:25:15.958]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bob in Texas.
[01:25:16.018 --> 01:25:16.699]  Bob, go ahead.
[01:25:17.019 --> 01:25:20.823]  Yes, I wouldn't worry too much about Clueless in Boston.
[01:25:21.103 --> 01:25:24.586]  I woke up when they shot Kennedy, so I don't know where he's been all this time.
[01:25:24.966 --> 01:25:30.872]  Well, I mean, I have to add, there's a lot of great listeners in the Boston and the whole Mass area, but either they're really awake or they're really not awake.
[01:25:31.272 --> 01:25:37.618]  And I mean, in Boston, in Mass, they have home inspections for your state property tax
[01:25:38.058 --> 01:25:42.580]  And income tax, and I've seen it on TV where they go in and count how many pairs of socks you've got.
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:44.621]  Total violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[01:25:44.661 --> 01:25:46.161]  I mean, what's wrong with these people?
[01:25:46.421 --> 01:25:56.005]  Well, what I have for you here is, I emailed you on this, it was so important, it was Newsweek, September 26, 2005, Newsweek, pages 24 through 25 is a picture of Bush in New Orleans in a Humvee.
[01:26:01.437 --> 01:26:04.598]  With Blanco and Negan and uh... You know, I saw that.
[01:26:04.638 --> 01:26:10.159]  You sent me a deal about uh... about how supposedly a Chai Com's driving the car, but I couldn't find that photo.
[01:26:11.279 --> 01:26:11.539]  Did you?
[01:26:11.599 --> 01:26:11.900]  Did you?
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:13.740]  Where were you looking for the photo?
[01:26:13.780 --> 01:26:14.320]  On email?
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:15.961]  Yeah, I clicked through on it and stuff.
[01:26:16.001 --> 01:26:16.481]  No, no, no.
[01:26:16.521 --> 01:26:17.721]  I wasn't able to send that.
[01:26:17.741 --> 01:26:20.602]  I'll have to photocopy it for you and send it to you.
[01:26:21.062 --> 01:26:22.042]  Well, are you sure?
[01:26:22.882 --> 01:26:23.502]  Sure about what?
[01:26:23.722 --> 01:26:25.623]  That a communist Chinese was driving him around.
[01:26:27.704 --> 01:26:29.506]  Alex, you have to see it for yourself.
[01:26:29.586 --> 01:26:31.727]  When I showed it to other people, their jaws dropped.
[01:26:32.628 --> 01:26:36.151]  He's wearing a little Chycom Red Star on his left lapel.
[01:26:36.191 --> 01:26:40.033]  Well, I know that there is a troop exchange program, and there are over 10,000 of them here.
[01:26:40.214 --> 01:26:41.975]  Over, what, 15,000 German.
[01:26:42.795 --> 01:26:44.597]  But it's the troop exchange program.
[01:26:44.617 --> 01:26:49.981]  I know there were Mexican, Dutch, British, and Australian troops in New Orleans, but I didn't know Chycoms.
[01:26:50.481 --> 01:26:51.482]  Well, here he is.
[01:26:51.542 --> 01:26:53.563]  You want me to send you the 100 address?
[01:26:53.884 --> 01:26:54.204]  Yes.
[01:26:54.524 --> 01:26:55.205]  Alright, I'll do that.
[01:26:56.371 --> 01:27:04.925]  The other thing is, I think what the tactic is, I started doing research on the net on this when I first saw it, and there's a website, something to do with Asian Red Dawn.
[01:27:04.965 --> 01:27:05.706]  Have you seen that?
[01:27:06.988 --> 01:27:07.129]  No.
[01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:13.682]  Well, anyway, I think what they're doing is they want to keep our troops drawn away from this continent so that we're wide open for attack.
[01:27:14.323 --> 01:27:18.264]  The old-timers always said that back when I was just waking up, say, 15 years ago.
[01:27:18.284 --> 01:27:21.465]  And I would laugh at it, but then I learned why they were saying it.
[01:27:22.226 --> 01:27:26.487]  There were New York Times articles with the 10 FEMA regions in the 19, what, 1937, when FEMA wasn't set up until 1979.
[01:27:31.309 --> 01:27:37.195]  There were plans to quote, use foreign troops to patrol America in newspapers in the mid-60s.
[01:27:37.756 --> 01:27:48.788]  I mean, I have these original news articles, and then at the same time, I sort of get in the urban warfare training video from Fort Polk and other areas of Louisiana, Mississippi.
[01:27:50.021 --> 01:28:03.491]  with these foreign troops and then I went to Urban Warfare Drills and actually videotaped it and our government admitted it was for domestically and then after 9-11 they put those foreign NATO AWACS in the skies and I remember seeing you and General McKenzie on Nightline.
[01:28:04.152 --> 01:28:06.794]  It was the Wednesday after 9-11, like eight days later.
[01:28:07.993 --> 01:28:17.281]  And he said that we're going to have a continental security perimeter, a Pan-American Union, and that foreign troops will patrol America while our troops are, quote, tied down in the war on terror.
[01:28:18.062 --> 01:28:20.184]  And Colonel Craig Roberts has confirmed that.
[01:28:20.264 --> 01:28:22.286]  I mean, they really planned that.
[01:28:22.446 --> 01:28:23.607]  That is real.
[01:28:23.647 --> 01:28:24.488]  That is not a joke.
[01:28:26.089 --> 01:28:26.550]  Anything else?
[01:28:29.867 --> 01:28:30.768]  I know you've got other callers.
[01:28:30.828 --> 01:28:31.848]  I don't want to hog their time.
[01:28:32.048 --> 01:28:32.289]  All right.
[01:28:32.329 --> 01:28:34.750]  God bless you, Bob, Dave, Jeff, Steve, and others.
[01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:39.453]  No, I mean, they signed a deal three years ago for Mexican and Canadian troops to go patrol America.
[01:28:42.115 --> 01:28:43.055]  We're on the march.
[01:28:43.496 --> 01:28:45.097]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.037 --> 01:28:48.699]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:01.127 --> 01:31:09.249]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[01:31:09.489 --> 01:31:15.130]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[01:31:15.430 --> 01:31:20.673]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[01:31:20.933 --> 01:31:23.014]  This is why you need the Filter Mag.
[01:31:23.294 --> 01:31:35.440]  The Filter Mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:40.102]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[01:31:40.322 --> 01:31:41.263]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:31:41.443 --> 01:31:43.064]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[01:31:43.204 --> 01:31:44.984]  That's FilterMag.com.
[01:31:45.245 --> 01:31:45.705]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[01:31:45.765 --> 01:31:45.965]  That's 800-345-8376.
[01:31:45.985 --> 01:31:47.306]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:31:47.386 --> 01:31:49.166]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:07.093 --> 01:32:08.873]  A red, white, and blue video special.
[01:32:08.893 --> 01:32:11.334]  I'm going to tell you about that and then go back to your calls and news.
[01:32:12.534 --> 01:32:15.175]  Red, white, and blue video special.
[01:32:15.195 --> 01:32:20.057]  Get 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, that covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:32:20.557 --> 01:32:23.397]  Then Oklahoma City, the first World Trade Center bombing.
[01:32:23.417 --> 01:32:26.298]  The second World Trade Center attack of 9-11.
[01:32:26.318 --> 01:32:27.679]  And then we go to the FEMA camps.
[01:32:27.699 --> 01:32:28.719]  We show the foreign troops.
[01:32:29.259 --> 01:32:35.223]  Video we shot, the urban warfare, the takeover drills, the national ID cards, the Patriot Act, all of it.
[01:32:35.463 --> 01:32:36.684]  It's really my classic film.
[01:32:36.704 --> 01:32:43.688]  And then my new bombshell film, Martial Law, the latest info on 9-11, the globalist master plan.
[01:32:44.648 --> 01:32:45.429]  Such an important film.
[01:32:45.449 --> 01:32:46.490]  It's three hours long.
[01:32:46.990 --> 01:32:51.072]  Road to Tyranny is just, what, 10 or 15 minutes short of three hours.
[01:32:51.352 --> 01:32:56.095]  I don't know, it's 170 minutes long, so it's two hours and 15 minutes long.
[01:32:56.135 --> 01:32:56.976]  Yeah, 10 minutes short.
[01:32:57.626 --> 01:33:06.912]  And then we got loose change the new Dylan Avery 9-11 video loose change second edition normally $71.85 $71.85 right now $44.95 so I mean how big of a discount is that?
[01:33:07.032 --> 01:33:07.513]  It's a $25 discount.
[01:33:17.683 --> 01:33:37.759]  And then we have where you can get Codex Magica, Tex Marr's new, just amazing book, showing the Illuminati hidden language in plain view, along with my new film, The Order of Death, that also has Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove on the same DVD or same VHS, but updated, the 2005 edition, with the new film, The Order of Death, the book and the two films for $45.95.
[01:33:38.219 --> 01:33:43.463]  And you save, I mean, a lot of money there.
[01:33:44.582 --> 01:33:47.865]  You save on the new film, the new book, and on the original film.
[01:33:47.885 --> 01:33:48.906]  You just get that for free.
[01:33:50.848 --> 01:33:56.573]  So, two films and that huge book the size of the... I guess it's almost as big as the Dallas phone book.
[01:33:57.074 --> 01:33:57.554]  The big one.
[01:33:57.794 --> 01:33:58.635]  It's the yellow pages.
[01:33:59.336 --> 01:34:00.397]  So, it's amazing.
[01:34:01.124 --> 01:34:02.505]  And then also we have another deal.
[01:34:02.585 --> 01:34:04.827]  Reveal the New World Order Plan Special.
[01:34:04.887 --> 01:34:05.908]  You get the Order of Death.
[01:34:05.988 --> 01:34:10.271]  It also comes with Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove on one DVD or VHS.
[01:34:10.611 --> 01:34:15.675]  With the new DVD, Loose Change, great 9-11 film, new film by Dylan Avery, for $34.95, normally $45.90.
[01:34:15.855 --> 01:34:20.298]  So you save, what is that, about $16 or, to be technical, you'd save $15.85 there.
[01:34:28.384 --> 01:34:28.924]  There you have it.
[01:34:29.784 --> 01:34:34.345]  So those new deals are up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.

[01:34:53.969 --> 01:34:56.330]  They can give you the mailing address if you missed it.
[01:34:57.269 --> 01:34:57.711]  It's 1-888-253-3139.
[01:34:57.771 --> 01:34:57.891]  That's 888.
[01:35:03.819 --> 01:35:04.279]  253-3139.
[01:35:05.419 --> 01:35:11.581]  And we also kept some of the other specials we had, some of the other Christmas and holiday specials that we have.
[01:35:11.601 --> 01:35:13.081]  We kept some of those, got rid of some.
[01:35:13.561 --> 01:35:14.702]  So definitely go check it out.
[01:35:14.742 --> 01:35:17.882]  And don't forget PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:35:17.902 --> 01:35:23.324]  15 cents a day, all my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, my weekly TV show that's won Best of Austin.
[01:35:23.344 --> 01:35:23.864]  It's pretty good.
[01:35:24.304 --> 01:35:28.445]  And then also we're taping at least one interview a week with cameras in studio.
[01:35:29.505 --> 01:35:35.329]  It'll be two from this last week with Tex Mars and David Stahl fighting the toll roads.
[01:35:35.789 --> 01:35:37.410]  Both of those will be going up very soon.
[01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:45.094]  We just put up the presidential candidate Michael McNair, now running for Congress against the neocon Michael McCaul.
[01:35:45.494 --> 01:35:47.976]  That already went up, so just so much.
[01:35:48.276 --> 01:35:48.956]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:35:52.654 --> 01:35:56.136]  And then, of course, a great new sponsor we're really proud of.
[01:35:56.216 --> 01:36:02.319]  I've been using their products for almost two years, and my wife said one day, why don't you get them as a sponsor?
[01:36:02.339 --> 01:36:06.261]  Because we get sponsor offers literally every day, and I won't take them.
[01:36:06.721 --> 01:36:12.885]  I mean, it's a free market, it's a free press, and the network can do what they want.
[01:36:12.965 --> 01:36:20.689]  I just have a really high standard, and the network itself has higher standards than most radio stations or networks out there.
[01:36:21.289 --> 01:36:29.333]  Well, they don't take a bunch of sexual ads or topless bar ads or stuff like that, but they can take medical ads if they want, or they can take cancer care ads if they want, or cancer treatments.
[01:36:29.713 --> 01:36:30.633]  I just don't do that.
[01:36:30.693 --> 01:36:34.235]  Or, you know, magical creams or whatever, or magic machines that heal you.
[01:36:34.895 --> 01:36:36.656]  I mean, seriously, folks, I just don't do that.
[01:36:36.956 --> 01:36:38.457]  And all that stuff might be legitimate.
[01:36:38.537 --> 01:36:38.997]  I don't know.
[01:36:39.037 --> 01:36:41.638]  It's just that I have to try something, usually for years.
[01:36:41.959 --> 01:36:48.421]  It's like New Millennium Concepts that makes the American Berkey and then carries the big national distributor, the British Berkey, so you get the best prices.
[01:36:51.238 --> 01:36:52.319]  I kind of digress.
[01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:53.821]  Now, this isn't really a plug here.
[01:36:53.841 --> 01:36:56.624]  This is me now just talking about the philosophy of the broadcast.
[01:36:59.607 --> 01:37:02.170]  And the Genesis Network, but myself included.
[01:37:02.190 --> 01:37:07.615]  If you hear me endorse something, it's because I really believe it's good and I think that evidence is the fact that it is good.
[01:37:08.937 --> 01:37:13.521]  If you knew what was in detergents and shampoos and over-the-counter soaps, I mean, go read it.
[01:37:14.807 --> 01:37:16.307]  A 20 foot long list.
[01:37:16.447 --> 01:37:17.948]  And go look up those chemicals.
[01:37:17.988 --> 01:37:18.868]  I mean, they're deadly.
[01:37:18.888 --> 01:37:19.568]  They're toxic.
[01:37:19.608 --> 01:37:20.608]  They're poisonous.
[01:37:20.628 --> 01:37:21.168]  They're bad.
[01:37:21.548 --> 01:37:23.509]  I don't know how they got that stuff approved.
[01:37:24.309 --> 01:37:25.669]  And it's just so bad for you.
[01:37:26.189 --> 01:37:28.630]  And it causes so many allergies and so many problems.
[01:37:28.690 --> 01:37:34.051]  And I know that if I used... You know, growing up, I would get rashes.
[01:37:34.411 --> 01:37:35.631]  Not bad ones, but I'd get rashes.
[01:37:35.651 --> 01:37:36.431]  And I could always tell.
[01:37:36.471 --> 01:37:41.593]  My dad would go in and go, you know, Carol to my mother, did you buy Tide again?
[01:37:41.613 --> 01:37:43.153]  Because that would give me and my dad rashes.
[01:37:43.173 --> 01:37:43.793]  She'd go, yeah.
[01:37:44.625 --> 01:37:45.985]  You know, I just, I forgot.
[01:37:46.025 --> 01:37:47.246]  It only happened every once in a while.
[01:37:47.286 --> 01:37:48.306]  Certain brands did it.
[01:37:48.886 --> 01:37:52.747]  Well, of course, now my parents use all natural stuff, and of course we do as well.
[01:37:52.788 --> 01:37:55.228]  People have gotten... It's taken us all time to get educated.
[01:37:55.648 --> 01:38:02.710]  But if we ever forget, or we're on vacation, or we sleep in a hotel room that's been washed with those detergents, you know, we'll get the little red rash.
[01:38:03.611 --> 01:38:06.912]  Folks, you need to... Okay, see, I just want to plug this and get on with it.
[01:38:06.952 --> 01:38:11.433]  The point is, take New Millennium Concepts.
[01:38:11.453 --> 01:38:14.054]  I mean, I was using big, burky water filters for
[01:38:15.865 --> 01:38:16.345]  What was it?
[01:38:16.445 --> 01:38:18.347]  Three years before they became a sponsor.
[01:38:18.367 --> 01:38:22.870]  And then they approached me about endorsing them and plugging them.
[01:38:22.890 --> 01:38:23.831]  And I said, sure, I'll do it.
[01:38:24.391 --> 01:38:25.732]  Because I was already using it.
[01:38:25.812 --> 01:38:33.037]  So with this Calvin Sub, they got a bunch of starter packs and test packs that cost a price for them.
[01:38:33.337 --> 01:38:34.238]  Just a great deal.
[01:38:34.258 --> 01:38:39.402]  And you get like, I don't know, like 10 bottles of different stuff for the price of one bottle at the grocery store.
[01:38:39.842 --> 01:38:41.443]  It's made out of coconut oil.
[01:38:41.523 --> 01:38:42.584]  It's made out of vegetable oil.
[01:38:42.604 --> 01:38:43.645]  It's made out of citrus.
[01:38:45.352 --> 01:38:51.597]  It's just so good, and I can go buy similar stuff at the local health food store, but it costs about four times as much.
[01:38:52.358 --> 01:38:55.621]  You see, it's even more than the normal detergent garbage.
[01:38:55.881 --> 01:39:03.387]  But this is cheaper than the detergent garbage, and a lot cheaper because it's factory direct than the stuff being sold at the health food store, and it's better.
[01:39:03.708 --> 01:39:05.169]  So that's what I'm trying to say to you.
[01:39:05.489 --> 01:39:10.914]  It's really a great deal, and you need to give Calbin Pure Soap Company a call.
[01:39:12.225 --> 01:39:12.866]  The number is 1-800-340-7091.
[01:39:12.886 --> 01:39:14.207]  Do yourself a favor, call and get their free catalog.
[01:39:14.227 --> 01:39:14.287]  1-800-340-7091.
[01:39:14.308 --> 01:39:14.568]  Write it down.
[01:39:14.608 --> 01:39:15.609]  Give it to you and your family.
[01:39:15.629 --> 01:39:15.669]  800-340-7091.
[01:39:15.689 --> 01:39:17.171]  And they've got just a bunch of different specials.
[01:39:30.959 --> 01:39:33.120]  Just go to the website and check it out.
[01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:36.282]  It's Cal, C-A-L, Ben, Pure Soap.
[01:39:36.322 --> 01:39:38.062]  I guess it's California and Pure Soap.
[01:39:38.483 --> 01:39:40.564]  C-A-L, Ben, Pure Soap dot com.
[01:39:41.024 --> 01:39:43.485]  Now they are a fly-by-night operation.
[01:39:43.505 --> 01:39:46.046]  They've been around, family owned, since 1947.
[01:39:46.126 --> 01:39:47.467]  So, 58 years or something.
[01:39:47.487 --> 01:39:51.309]  I said in the ad 57 years, but I'm wrong.
[01:39:51.349 --> 01:39:52.089]  I don't know, what's 56 and 3?
[01:39:58.648 --> 01:39:59.672]  It's actually more than that.
[01:39:59.712 --> 01:40:00.898]  I guess 59 years.
[01:40:02.224 --> 01:40:03.670]  On the ad copy they sent me, they said...
[01:40:04.432 --> 01:40:09.275]  They said 57 years, but I guess that's old ad copy too, so it doesn't matter.
[01:40:09.355 --> 01:40:10.616]  I get caught up in my minutiae, folks.
[01:40:10.996 --> 01:40:13.038]  CalbinPureSoap.com.
[01:40:13.098 --> 01:40:14.479]  Okay, I'm done talking about it.
[01:40:14.499 --> 01:40:19.462]  It's just their new sponsor, and I want to plug them and support them because it really makes a lot of sense.
[01:40:19.522 --> 01:40:21.904]  If you missed that website, we've got a link to it on InfoWars.com.
[01:40:21.944 --> 01:40:28.728]  Alright, I've got a bunch of news, and I've got a bunch of audio clips, and we're now way past halfway through the transmission.
[01:40:29.228 --> 01:40:30.129]  It is 41 minutes and 40 seconds.
[01:40:32.421 --> 01:40:45.773]  Well, speaking of the atomic clock, I've been listening all weekend to the neocons and Feinstein and the red diaper doper baby demanding that we go into Iran and start an even worse war than what we've got now.
[01:41:03.166 --> 01:41:06.127]  Yeah, sir, you're distorting so bad, you've got your... Yeah, I noticed it.
[01:41:06.267 --> 01:41:07.947]  It's feeding back on the phone here for some reason.
[01:41:07.967 --> 01:41:11.508]  You've got your phone turned up so high, it's just... just back off of it.
[01:41:11.528 --> 01:41:12.008]  Back away a little bit.
[01:41:12.068 --> 01:41:12.528]  Is that better?
[01:41:12.708 --> 01:41:13.148]  Yeah, that's better.
[01:41:13.168 --> 01:41:13.828]  Just go ahead.
[01:41:13.928 --> 01:41:14.649]  Oh, okay.
[01:41:14.669 --> 01:41:24.531]  Look, when we went into Iraq this time, we bombed them people for 12 years and knocked out all their radar and their airfields and their tanks and everything.
[01:41:24.551 --> 01:41:25.171]  13 years.
[01:41:25.571 --> 01:41:26.091]  Of course.
[01:41:26.391 --> 01:41:26.931]  Whatever.
[01:41:27.411 --> 01:41:29.792]  They were well degraded before we ever went in there and...
[01:41:30.151 --> 01:41:33.493]  These people seem to think we're going to go in there with a brigade and overthrow them.
[01:41:36.714 --> 01:41:38.935]  Uh, now the globalists want to go into Iran.
[01:41:38.975 --> 01:41:41.577]  I mean, they're actually starting what they call World War 4.
[01:41:41.637 --> 01:41:43.438]  They consider the Cold War World War 3.
[01:41:44.198 --> 01:41:50.521]  Well, not only that, 30 or 40% of the world's oil flows through the 32 mile wide Strait of Hormuz.
[01:41:51.082 --> 01:41:55.784]  How much are you willing to pay for gas and to heat your house to keep Israel safe?
[01:41:56.934 --> 01:41:59.837]  The globalists would absolutely love it, and you know that is a part of it.
[01:41:59.857 --> 01:42:07.584]  It is Israel's policy to want to have the pan-Israel, but I would say that's just a portion of it.
[01:42:07.624 --> 01:42:13.569]  It's really about oil, weapons, sales, launch bases, and political distractions here domestically.
[01:42:13.929 --> 01:42:15.491]  According to the battle planners,
[01:42:15.991 --> 01:42:22.074]  Well, you know, they claim that North Korea has nuclear weapons, and here we're shipping them oil and food!
[01:42:35.064 --> 01:42:35.625]  No, Dave.
[01:42:36.605 --> 01:42:38.687]  Dave, you're engaging in too much common sense.
[01:42:38.707 --> 01:42:41.309]  You need to call me back another day with a better phone line.
[01:42:41.650 --> 01:42:45.272]  I don't think it's us, but it must be on a cordless phone.
[01:42:45.292 --> 01:42:45.993]  I have to let you go.
[01:42:46.493 --> 01:42:47.454]  I wish I didn't have to.
[01:42:47.534 --> 01:42:49.216]  The phone's just getting bad there.
[01:42:49.716 --> 01:42:50.297]  Great points.
[01:42:50.377 --> 01:42:53.259]  Listen, again, they make it real simple for you.
[01:42:53.779 --> 01:42:59.544]  If you love America, if you want to cheer for the home team, we need to be for blowing away them Arabs.
[01:42:59.584 --> 01:43:02.647]  Well, the Iranians aren't even Arabs.
[01:43:02.967 --> 01:43:04.208]  They're Persians.
[01:43:04.952 --> 01:43:18.571]  And to make a long story short, our criminal government in 1953 removed a pro-western Mosaddegh and carried out bombings all over the country and blamed it on him when he was man of the year, anti-communist, he was a good guy.
[01:43:20.319 --> 01:43:25.844]  Christians, Jews, all lived in peace there, and it was a free country, and they went in, and our government didn't like that.
[01:43:25.904 --> 01:43:29.467]  And Israel said in 1983, they want Iraq run by radical mullahs.
[01:43:29.788 --> 01:43:31.829]  They want three to four factions.
[01:43:31.869 --> 01:43:33.051]  They want it in shambles.
[01:43:33.111 --> 01:43:34.992]  And now, the burqas are going back on.
[01:43:35.012 --> 01:43:40.137]  The women, again, Iraq, 60% of the women were the graduates of college.
[01:43:40.577 --> 01:43:44.401]  The vast majority of their doctors, women, were literally doing better than they are here.
[01:43:45.001 --> 01:43:48.942]  And they had, I'm not endorsing it as a good sign of a country, but they were very secular.
[01:43:49.322 --> 01:43:52.423]  You know, rock and roll radio stations, very hip.
[01:43:53.323 --> 01:43:55.043]  People visiting there, big tourists.
[01:43:55.704 --> 01:43:59.004]  And Saddam would give speeches with 10,000 people with machine guns around him.
[01:43:59.544 --> 01:44:02.345]  I mean, I'm not saying he's a good guy, but compared to our government he is.
[01:44:02.725 --> 01:44:05.506]  I mean, if you really want to be frank, I mean, they actually hired the guy.
[01:44:05.526 --> 01:44:06.686]  In fact, we had a different policy.
[01:44:07.366 --> 01:44:09.647]  And trained him as a CIA assassin and got him in in 1979.
[01:44:11.736 --> 01:44:14.237]  But, I mean, if he's so evil, why can I go buy an AK-47?
[01:44:14.257 --> 01:44:26.584]  Well, not because of liberation, I can't, but why could anybody walk up and just buy AK-47s on the street, buy hand grenades, and then go to a big rally with Saddam Hussein and fire machine guns in the air?
[01:44:27.465 --> 01:44:29.065]  I mean, do you see the school board doing that?
[01:44:29.085 --> 01:44:30.146]  Do you see the governor doing that?
[01:44:30.166 --> 01:44:31.307]  Do you see George Bush doing that?
[01:44:31.787 --> 01:44:33.048]  Now, in the past, they did.
[01:44:33.088 --> 01:44:34.188]  That's how America was.
[01:44:35.029 --> 01:44:39.311]  I mean, Andrew Jackson could go give a speech with 20,000 people around him with guns on their hips.
[01:44:40.490 --> 01:44:45.314]  Because it's just not true what you've heard about Iraq, folks.
[01:44:45.774 --> 01:44:48.136]  The policy is radical Muslims running it.
[01:44:48.377 --> 01:44:49.458]  And don't worry, they will!
[01:44:50.999 --> 01:44:52.300]  It's just, it's all baloney!
[01:44:53.241 --> 01:44:55.903]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:44:56.303 --> 01:44:58.425]  Let's go to Jeff in Denver, then Steve and Ian.
[01:44:58.465 --> 01:44:59.085]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[01:44:59.386 --> 01:45:08.794]  Yeah, Alex, I just wanted to make a brief comment about your earlier caller who was questioning or doubting that 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:45:09.781 --> 01:45:16.746]  I don't know what he's smoking or what kind of pills he's taking, but all the evidence, I mean, it's just like a big puzzle.
[01:45:17.367 --> 01:45:22.530]  And of course, I challenge George Bush, just be alone.
[01:45:23.111 --> 01:45:38.142]  I challenge George Bush to a debate about it and present all the evidence to him and of course, we'll see what he thinks about it, but in any event, George Bush, he knows all about the 9-11 inside job and the
[01:45:38.993 --> 01:45:40.454]  Let me say something else about this.
[01:45:41.794 --> 01:45:48.676]  A good friend of mine who used to be a government agent who of course quit doing dirty tricks for him because they framed his son.
[01:45:49.557 --> 01:45:53.618]  That's why they framed his son is because he said, I'm not going to do dirty deals for you guys anymore.
[01:45:54.138 --> 01:45:55.739]  And his name's John Gary Peeler.
[01:45:56.239 --> 01:45:57.780]  He lives in Little Rock, Arkansas.
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:03.082]  And John worked for the ATF in different capacities with the FBI.
[01:46:03.682 --> 01:46:06.503]  And of course, he was involved in the Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:46:07.566 --> 01:46:22.852]  Also the 9-11 deal, but anyways... See, I don't know this individual and he hasn't approached me so I really don't want to sit here and just say he did all this, so... Well, anyways, John, you know, according to John, he lives in Little Rock and... Yeah, I know you said that.
[01:46:23.052 --> 01:46:36.157]  Yeah, anyways, basically, the Oklahoma City Barmen, okay, they knew it was going to happen, okay, they knew that it was planning, they knew that the operatives were
[01:46:36.638 --> 01:46:37.439]  Planning to blow it up.
[01:46:37.559 --> 01:46:39.520]  Richard Wayne Snell and some other people.
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:40.561]  Well that's not debatable.
[01:46:40.601 --> 01:46:44.183]  We have FBI and local police and firefighters saying BATF told them that.
[01:46:44.384 --> 01:46:51.589]  Oh yeah, I mean it's... The BATF was practicing out in the Proving Ground in Arizona blowing up Ryder trucks eight months before.
[01:46:51.649 --> 01:46:52.329]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:46:52.469 --> 01:46:53.030]  Exactly!
[01:46:53.230 --> 01:46:59.795]  And of course they were putting brass angle irons inside the structures with C4 explosives.
[01:47:00.195 --> 01:47:02.596]  Well I mean, that's a closed case.
[01:47:02.657 --> 01:47:03.837]  I mean, that's the conclusion.
[01:47:03.857 --> 01:47:04.598]  What else is on your mind?
[01:47:05.273 --> 01:47:14.541]  Well, in any event, I just wanted to point out that, of course, that was the first, okay, or one of the... Well, the FBI cooked the bomb and trained the drivers in the first World Trade Center, too.
[01:47:14.922 --> 01:47:15.562]  Right, exactly.
[01:47:15.582 --> 01:47:21.467]  So, you know, they started out with the 93, then the Oklahoma City bomb, and then they led us to the 9-11 World Trade Center.
[01:47:21.768 --> 01:47:22.248]  I hear you.
[01:47:22.849 --> 01:47:32.397]  And, uh, basically, um, you know, all of these cover-ups, okay, and I don't know what it's going to take for some people to wake up
[01:47:32.964 --> 01:47:37.885]  I mean, what is it going to take for this guy to believe the police coming up asking for his papers?
[01:47:37.905 --> 01:47:40.626]  I mean... Well, you know, I'm asking, is America a police state?
[01:47:40.646 --> 01:47:41.366]  And he wouldn't answer.
[01:47:41.386 --> 01:47:42.187]  I appreciate the call.
[01:47:42.207 --> 01:47:44.727]  I mean, they're openly talking about putting us in FEMA camps.
[01:47:44.747 --> 01:47:47.028]  They're openly talking about martial law, how good it is.
[01:47:47.048 --> 01:47:50.249]  I mean, they're openly talking about how wonderful the foreign troops are to keep us safe.
[01:47:50.589 --> 01:47:52.369]  I mean, they're really setting the precedent here.
[01:47:52.930 --> 01:47:54.530]  Uh, Steve in Pensacola, Florida.
[01:47:54.550 --> 01:47:55.170]  Go ahead, Steve.
[01:47:55.950 --> 01:47:56.691]  Hello, Alex.
[01:47:56.711 --> 01:47:57.591]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:47:57.631 --> 01:47:58.311]  Thank you for holding.
[01:47:58.331 --> 01:47:58.691]  Go ahead.
[01:47:58.871 --> 01:47:59.571]  I'm in Pensacola.
[01:47:59.631 --> 01:48:01.512]  As you know, the New York Journal never
[01:48:02.375 --> 01:48:04.596]  Never retracted the story about training terrorists.
[01:48:05.337 --> 01:48:08.679]  I watch all this, I track it at the Naval Air Station.
[01:48:08.699 --> 01:48:14.322]  Now all they did was say, oh it wasn't four of the hijackers trained by the government, it was three at this base.
[01:48:14.922 --> 01:48:18.084]  The previous caller is either a government plant or very deceived.
[01:48:18.884 --> 01:48:25.548]  I have Gulf War illness and I've been promulgating a lot of information about it for years, especially the beyond treason
[01:48:26.246 --> 01:48:28.667]  My own sister does not understand and believe this.
[01:48:28.687 --> 01:48:29.648]  She's my younger sister.
[01:48:29.788 --> 01:48:30.288]  She's 50.
[01:48:30.548 --> 01:48:33.010]  By the way, and I'll hold you over if you need me, Steve, because I want to talk to you.
[01:48:33.650 --> 01:48:48.298]  Listen, I remember having debates with UT professors 10 years ago about how Gulf War illness didn't exist and how DU was good for you, when the Pentagon's own manuals say depleted uranium is deadly poisonous and radioactive and a deadly particulate.
[01:48:48.618 --> 01:48:49.919]  I mean, as deadly as it gets.
[01:48:50.479 --> 01:49:09.868]  And then now the government admits that the shots were deadly, and now they admit the troops were hit with sarin gas, and they've done the brain stem studies of the dead ones, and every one of them that shrivels up and dies, you don't shrivel up and die because you're a hypochondriac, they go test the poor dead men's brain stems, and they're full of sarin and VX!
[01:49:10.589 --> 01:49:15.691]  Dr. Roeke covers all this, thepowerhour.com and your website, you carry the Beyond Treason.
[01:49:16.377 --> 01:49:23.822]  Well, my point is, my brother-in-law, my sister, they're brainwashed by Fox News like so many Americans back on the World Trade Centers.
[01:49:23.882 --> 01:49:31.788]  I've explained to my brother-in-law that the jet fuel temperature of 1700 degrees cannot melt steel, and if you'll hold me over... Yeah, stay there.
[01:49:31.828 --> 01:49:33.329]  But I mean, look, I tell your family this.
[01:49:33.509 --> 01:49:39.153]  If they think mercury's so good, because the news says it is, then go drink a bucket of it and flop around like a fish and die.
[01:49:39.653 --> 01:49:43.196]  If they think DU's so good, go snort a big line of it.
[01:49:43.849 --> 01:49:45.330]  I mean, I'm just sick of these people!
[01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:46.130]  We'll be right back!
[01:49:46.150 --> 01:49:47.491]  It's not debatable!
[01:49:53.593 --> 01:49:56.454]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:56.694 --> 01:49:58.275]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.

[01:50:10.700 --> 01:50:12.661]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:50:12.881 --> 01:50:15.723]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:15.823 --> 01:50:20.486]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:20.686 --> 01:50:25.069]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:25.329 --> 01:50:32.553]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:52:58.200 --> 01:53:00.461]  Hey, I know I've played this 15 times.
[01:53:02.231 --> 01:53:03.012]  Just on radio.
[01:53:03.032 --> 01:53:04.433]  I probably play it 20 on TV.
[01:53:04.473 --> 01:53:06.535]  The reason I do is, this aired all over the country.
[01:53:06.975 --> 01:53:08.576]  They had local versions of it everywhere.
[01:53:08.596 --> 01:53:12.960]  Oh, two new studies, and they were government studies, show mercury's actually good for your brain.
[01:53:14.081 --> 01:53:16.303]  And so I play this, and we'll go back to Steve.
[01:53:16.323 --> 01:53:17.524]  It's only about 30 seconds long.
[01:53:17.544 --> 01:53:18.865]  This is local CBS news.
[01:53:19.485 --> 01:53:21.167]  And it's just like they get on the news and say it's the law.
[01:53:21.187 --> 01:53:22.128]  You gotta take vaccines.
[01:53:22.148 --> 01:53:22.808]  There's no law.
[01:53:22.948 --> 01:53:23.609]  They just say it.
[01:53:24.413 --> 01:53:25.833]  Again, this is demonstratable.
[01:53:25.873 --> 01:53:28.974]  This shows the level of just the flagrant lying.
[01:53:29.014 --> 01:53:31.734]  Like, Fox News says DU's good for the troops.
[01:53:31.834 --> 01:53:32.975]  Oh, it doesn't hurt anybody.
[01:53:34.335 --> 01:53:35.155]  It's the same thing.
[01:53:35.215 --> 01:53:36.535]  It's even worse than mercury.
[01:53:36.555 --> 01:53:37.215]  Go ahead and play it.
[01:53:37.675 --> 01:53:40.116]  Mercury-containing vaccines may have on kids.
[01:53:40.356 --> 01:53:43.716]  A life-saving device wins over-the-counter approval by the FDA.
[01:53:44.317 --> 01:53:46.357]  And sick of your glasses and contact lenses?
[01:53:46.437 --> 01:53:49.097]  A new corrective eye surgery is approved today.
[01:53:49.117 --> 01:53:52.558]  Here's tonight's medical headlines with medical watch reporter, Seema Nathar.
[01:53:55.163 --> 01:54:01.145]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[01:54:01.625 --> 01:54:08.046]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives in vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[01:54:08.066 --> 01:54:15.488]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[01:54:15.508 --> 01:54:18.349]  Alright, so let's go back to Steve.
[01:54:19.448 --> 01:54:28.294]  Steve, the Army's own manuals, every piece of literature about it says it's deadly, poisonous, and radioactive, but they just say DU's fine, no more gears needed, boys, just breathe it.
[01:54:28.835 --> 01:54:36.179]  I mean, it just, for the cops, for the military that serve this evil system, I mean, do you think they care about you when they do this to you?
[01:54:36.199 --> 01:54:39.101]  I mean, there's no reason to give you deadly vaccines.
[01:54:39.121 --> 01:54:40.862]  There's no reason to have you breathe this stuff.
[01:54:41.103 --> 01:54:42.844]  They just do it because they're evil.
[01:54:43.024 --> 01:54:43.544]  Go ahead, Steve.
[01:54:43.924 --> 01:54:47.687]  That's clearly because of their depopulation plans, but back to the World Trade Center,
[01:54:48.177 --> 01:54:57.222]  I was telling my brother-in-law that the steel girders, there was 240 of them in the building, and not like the PBS special lied about.
[01:54:57.262 --> 01:54:58.763]  There was 240 of those girders.
[01:54:59.224 --> 01:55:00.504]  Huffschmid showed it on his video.
[01:55:01.045 --> 01:55:05.047]  They need 3,000 degrees plus to melt that type of steel.
[01:55:05.067 --> 01:55:07.248]  3,000 to get them red and start weakening them?
[01:55:07.288 --> 01:55:08.229]  Yes.
[01:55:08.269 --> 01:55:15.113]  Your jet fuel never gets over 1,700 degrees, and if people want to believe that that'll melt steel, why don't they go to their gas stove
[01:55:15.563 --> 01:55:16.564]  And look at that blue flame.
[01:55:16.584 --> 01:55:18.925]  How come it doesn't melt the little grates on your stove?
[01:55:18.945 --> 01:55:21.686]  And that blue flame is hotter than jet fuel.
[01:55:22.006 --> 01:55:33.392]  My next point is, Eric Hushmitt, even on his video, put a square root formula, T equals D. T equals the square root of D over 16, which proves that those buildings could never
[01:55:34.065 --> 01:55:35.526]  Never fall in 8.4 seconds.
[01:55:35.546 --> 01:55:37.547]  Well, I mean, what did you do with the military?
[01:55:37.587 --> 01:55:48.272]  I mean, I'm not some former military guy on explosives, but I know that the UL underwriters, I know that the firefighters, I know that all the evidence, you can even see the blast points as they're blowing up the buildings.
[01:55:48.332 --> 01:55:51.533]  I mean, do you have any expertise when you were in the military?
[01:55:51.553 --> 01:55:53.194]  I mean, does that look like controlled demolition to you?
[01:55:53.514 --> 01:55:58.697]  I do have expertise, and I was a welder for my career, not counting the explosive expertise that I have.
[01:55:58.737 --> 01:56:03.779]  Not as much as General Parkin, but I had quite a bit, and that's why I know we've been a complete fraud.
[01:56:04.195 --> 01:56:05.596]  That the American public has been believing.
[01:56:06.276 --> 01:56:12.399]  And to watch Fox News and Believe This and CNN and ABC and CBS and NBC is completely amazing!
[01:56:13.140 --> 01:56:16.821]  I've seen the TV footage of the firemen explaining the bombs going off in the World Trade Centers.
[01:56:17.342 --> 01:56:18.202]  The way they're going BOOM!
[01:56:18.262 --> 01:56:18.462]  BOOM!
[01:56:18.482 --> 01:56:18.682]  BOOM!
[01:56:18.702 --> 01:56:18.882]  BOOM!
[01:56:18.902 --> 01:56:19.082]  BOOM!
[01:56:19.123 --> 01:56:19.283]  BOOM!
[01:56:19.303 --> 01:56:19.483]  BOOM!
[01:56:19.503 --> 01:56:19.683]  BOOM!
[01:56:19.983 --> 01:56:20.603]  I've seen that.
[01:56:21.204 --> 01:56:24.505]  I've seen your video of the martial law and 9-1-1 rise of the police state.
[01:56:24.925 --> 01:56:25.666]  It's fantastic.
[01:56:25.726 --> 01:56:27.267]  It shows building number 7 crimping.
[01:56:27.907 --> 01:56:30.268]  It shows Silverstein admitting pulling the building number 7.
[01:56:31.309 --> 01:56:33.990]  It shows smoke exiting the sides of the World Trade Centers.
[01:56:34.477 --> 01:56:36.057]  At the demolition point of the charges?
[01:56:36.758 --> 01:56:39.858]  If somebody can watch this, they're absolute furniture.
[01:56:40.298 --> 01:56:43.399]  As you used to say, they're willingly ignorant, as it says in my Bible.
[01:56:43.899 --> 01:56:47.600]  They forget the things that the Lord taught us, and they are willingly ignorant.
[01:56:47.620 --> 01:56:54.202]  To the Pentagon, I'd like to know who confiscated all the video cameras that show, that directly showed whatever came in and hit that thing.
[01:56:54.222 --> 01:57:03.984]  And if we're to believe that it was a jet, Eric Elschmidt, and I've got frames of myself, and even a New American had three of the frames of the video footage, they should have showed the jet
[01:57:06.899 --> 01:57:10.700]  They want us to debate this, or they're lying.
[01:57:10.780 --> 01:57:14.761]  Either way, they admit they had hundreds of cameras, most surveilled position on the globe.
[01:57:14.781 --> 01:57:16.982]  I mean, folks, it's bristling with cameras.
[01:57:17.482 --> 01:57:21.123]  They went to hotels, they went to gas stations and confiscated them.
[01:57:21.903 --> 01:57:22.283]  Why?
[01:57:22.483 --> 01:57:22.823]  Why?
[01:57:22.843 --> 01:57:22.903]  Why?
[01:57:23.104 --> 01:57:23.364]  Why?
[01:57:23.904 --> 01:57:29.485]  Again, it's any black op they run, they want it to be confusing and smoky.
[01:57:29.525 --> 01:57:30.066]  Thanks for the call.
[01:57:30.086 --> 01:57:30.726]  Third Hour coming up.
[01:57:31.917 --> 01:57:36.760]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:37.100]  Big Brother.
[01:57:49.677 --> 01:57:50.737]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:51.457 --> 01:57:52.558]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:53.198 --> 01:57:54.058]  You want answers?
[01:57:54.778 --> 01:57:55.738]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.338 --> 01:57:59.999]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:00.519 --> 01:58:04.640]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:14.221 --> 01:58:16.402]  Look, we didn't make the world the way it is.
[01:58:17.737 --> 01:58:20.778]  By that I mean, I wish it wasn't this way.
[01:58:20.878 --> 01:58:23.199]  But I can't wish it to go away.
[01:58:23.279 --> 01:58:25.499]  I can't wish we didn't have a criminal lead.
[01:58:25.860 --> 01:58:27.660]  Totally ruthless, totally out of control.
[01:58:28.060 --> 01:58:28.800]  That's what we have.
[01:58:28.820 --> 01:58:30.601]  And now they're beating the drums to go into Iran.
[01:58:30.621 --> 01:58:31.661]  I've got to tell this.
[01:58:32.382 --> 01:58:34.302]  Bush is out defending how he spies on us.
[01:58:34.322 --> 01:58:35.302]  There's talk of impeaching him.
[01:58:35.342 --> 01:58:36.243]  I'm going to play that clip.
[01:58:37.963 --> 01:58:40.584]  There's more and more evidence showing that television is brainwashing us.
[01:58:40.624 --> 01:58:43.865]  Not just with the propaganda, but with the flicker of the television set itself.
[01:58:44.365 --> 01:58:46.086]  Major news stories on that today.
[01:58:48.027 --> 01:58:53.031]  There's a lot of news and information, but let's... I'm going to continue to take calls, but now I've really got to hurry through.
[01:58:53.051 --> 01:58:54.192]  The calls are all so good.
[01:58:54.212 --> 01:58:57.174]  I wish I could talk to all of you forever, but I've got to really move quickly now.
[01:58:57.474 --> 01:59:00.516]  Let's get some more of these out of the way, and then we'll get back into more news.
[01:59:00.536 --> 01:59:03.959]  I'm going to take three or four more, and then we'll get back into news and keep taking calls.
[01:59:04.479 --> 01:59:06.681]  Ian up in Canada, then Wyatt and others.
[01:59:06.701 --> 01:59:07.202]  Go ahead, Ian.
[01:59:08.362 --> 01:59:09.203]  Hello, Alex.
[01:59:09.223 --> 01:59:15.528]  Yesterday I had a great InfoWars conversation with a British family who just moved here, and they were raving about
[01:59:16.058 --> 01:59:29.202]  The movie The Island, which reminded me that I had to call you and tell you that I believe I have the book upon which that movie was based, a book called The Experiment, by John Darnton, who is a 30-year veteran with the New York Times.
[01:59:29.342 --> 01:59:33.763]  When he published the book in 99, he was a cultural editor with that paper.
[01:59:34.243 --> 01:59:39.265]  So that would be an interview I would like to hear with John Darnton at the New York Times.
[01:59:41.241 --> 01:59:45.643]  John Darnton, New York Times, and he wrote the book, The Islands, based on?
[01:59:45.963 --> 01:59:47.944]  Yes, the book is titled The Experiment.
[01:59:48.464 --> 01:59:55.968]  It's looking at the leaf here, it's about an island off the Carolinas where they are producing clones as organ banks.
[01:59:56.428 --> 01:59:57.248]  It's a good movie, yeah.
[01:59:57.268 --> 01:59:59.509]  By the way, that's already going on.
[01:59:59.549 --> 02:00:04.872]  They're already putting cloned human embryos, human babies, in cow uteruses.
[02:00:05.452 --> 02:00:07.593]  I first read about that nine years ago.
[02:00:08.340 --> 02:00:15.325]  Oh, right, and they'd heard the same things in Britain, that Dolly the Sheep is just a public relations scam.
[02:00:16.306 --> 02:00:16.546]  Yes.
[02:00:17.567 --> 02:00:20.029]  So, do you think you could get in touch with John Darton?
[02:00:20.089 --> 02:00:21.750]  That's D-A-R-N-T-O-N?
[02:00:21.810 --> 02:00:24.232]  Yeah, I got a rote down here.
[02:00:24.252 --> 02:00:24.993]  I have it written down here.
[02:00:25.273 --> 02:00:34.880]  Yeah, and I hope he's still at the New York Times, but clearly the book was written as a cover story of sort of a novelization of research that he'd done.
[02:00:34.900 --> 02:00:36.742]  Oh, is he a doctor?
[02:00:37.643 --> 02:00:38.324]  Uh, no.
[02:00:39.245 --> 02:00:41.187]  Oh, you mean he'd read about that, yeah.
[02:00:41.308 --> 02:00:43.710]  Research as a journalist.
[02:00:43.811 --> 02:00:47.635]  It's like the guy that wrote the 007 series was M.I.
[02:00:48.656 --> 02:00:50.378]  from League 6 himself, yeah.
[02:00:50.458 --> 02:00:50.999]  Good point.
[02:00:51.159 --> 02:00:53.001]  Yeah, I hadn't thought of... Ian Fleming.
[02:00:53.842 --> 02:00:57.807]  I hadn't thought of the possible intelligence connections that he might have.
[02:00:58.223 --> 02:01:06.308]  But he wrote another book called Neanderthals, so he clearly has an interest in the biological... He also might just know what sells well, but it is a good movie.
[02:01:06.549 --> 02:01:07.829]  I personally like The Island.
[02:01:08.350 --> 02:01:10.471]  And again, the book is titled The Experiment.
[02:01:10.711 --> 02:01:11.072]  Okay.
[02:01:11.512 --> 02:01:11.792]  Thanks.
[02:01:12.112 --> 02:01:12.933]  Thank you so much.
[02:01:12.993 --> 02:01:14.234]  I appreciate that call.
[02:01:14.554 --> 02:01:15.595]  Let's talk to Wyatt.
[02:01:16.355 --> 02:01:17.096]  How you doing, Wyatt?
[02:01:17.376 --> 02:01:17.836]  Good, Alex.
[02:01:17.856 --> 02:01:18.336]  How are you?
[02:01:18.437 --> 02:01:18.717]  Good.
[02:01:18.757 --> 02:01:19.938]  How are things going in Maryland?
[02:01:21.519 --> 02:01:22.279]  About the same.
[02:01:23.880 --> 02:01:27.963]  The Maryland General Assembly overrode the governor.
[02:01:28.610 --> 02:01:35.656]  I want a Wal-Mart bill to force Wal-Mart to spend X amount of dollars on health care.
[02:01:35.676 --> 02:01:37.197]  Of course, I made national news.
[02:01:37.257 --> 02:01:39.279]  Maryland's the socialist state.
[02:01:39.639 --> 02:01:42.762]  Yeah, it sounds good on the surface, but it's bad in the final equation.
[02:01:43.262 --> 02:01:43.543]  Sure.
[02:01:43.843 --> 02:01:46.725]  Well, what it's going to have to... Wal-Mart wanted to build a superstore.
[02:01:46.745 --> 02:01:51.469]  I'm not that I'm a big Wal-Mart fan because of certain economic conditions, but... They're horrible.
[02:01:52.050 --> 02:01:52.630]  Absolutely.
[02:01:52.650 --> 02:01:53.631]  But they were going to build a huge
[02:01:55.488 --> 02:01:56.430]  I think so.
[02:02:05.757 --> 02:02:08.139]  Yeah, laid off because of Wal-Mart, mainly.
[02:02:08.199 --> 02:02:08.679]  Right, right.
[02:02:08.839 --> 02:02:18.666]  And so Wal-Mart... So Wal-Mart is not going to build it now, and they're probably going to lay off a thousand people so they don't have to meet the... Well, stay there.
[02:02:18.706 --> 02:02:20.407]  People always defend Wal-Mart.
[02:02:20.427 --> 02:02:21.748]  They say, well, it's free market.
[02:02:22.229 --> 02:02:28.673]  When you are buying goods from at least, this is mainstream news, 700 slave camps, that isn't free market.
[02:02:28.693 --> 02:02:30.495]  Well, Americans can compete.
[02:02:31.275 --> 02:02:33.637]  Folks, competing in slaves isn't competing.
[02:02:34.381 --> 02:02:37.663]  It's an economic tool the globalists are using to beat our heads in.
[02:02:38.283 --> 02:02:39.063]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:39.183 --> 02:02:41.264]  I never shop at Walmart, folks.
[02:02:43.865 --> 02:02:48.187]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:48.367 --> 02:02:52.809]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:52.949 --> 02:02:57.311]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:57.351 --> 02:02:58.692]  The New World Order.

[02:05:43.507 --> 02:05:48.551]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:48.912 --> 02:05:51.234]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:51.254 --> 02:05:53.996]  Alright, Wyatt in Maryland.
[02:05:54.016 --> 02:05:55.677]  He started out talking about Walmart.
[02:05:56.919 --> 02:05:59.321]  Well, he's going on in Maryland and it's a Walmart bill.
[02:05:59.661 --> 02:06:05.846]  It's for, it was designed, the bill was designed for any business with 10,000 or more people working for them.
[02:06:05.906 --> 02:06:09.089]  And Walmart is the only one that fits that description in Maryland.
[02:06:09.845 --> 02:06:24.618]  And so they had to spend X amount of dollars, X amount of percentage of their payroll on health care, or if they didn't do that, they would have to pay the state of Maryland 8% of their payroll to the state as a tax.
[02:06:24.738 --> 02:06:27.520]  And then Maryland would supposedly give you health care, yeah?
[02:06:27.540 --> 02:06:28.721]  Yeah, you know, socialism.
[02:06:29.022 --> 02:06:34.186]  So I look at this, even though Walmart, of course, everything in America almost is in Japan, I mean, China.
[02:06:34.727 --> 02:06:38.609]  But I look at this as fascism and socialism.
[02:06:38.789 --> 02:06:39.649]  That's all it is.
[02:06:39.689 --> 02:06:46.272]  When you force a company, when you have control over a company, whatever company it is, you're going to make them pay a tax to the state.
[02:06:46.512 --> 02:06:47.312]  No, I agree with you.
[02:06:47.332 --> 02:06:50.293]  The problem is that corporations have gotten bigger than governments.
[02:06:50.354 --> 02:06:55.736]  I think, what is it, Walmart is the 44th biggest economy in the world.
[02:06:55.776 --> 02:06:56.716]  Thanks for the call, Wyatt.
[02:06:57.917 --> 02:06:59.577]  And just a little caveat on Walmart.
[02:06:59.617 --> 02:07:00.978]  This is why I have a problem with Walmart.
[02:07:02.259 --> 02:07:14.058]  A couple years ago, it was in several of the New York papers that they buy goods directly, exclusively from 700 plus slave camps, prisons, and... I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[02:07:15.388 --> 02:07:21.932]  And so it's not just that Walmart also makes the sweetheart deals with China to get stuff at the lowest prices and bring it into America.
[02:07:21.992 --> 02:07:23.093]  It's coming from slaves.
[02:07:23.694 --> 02:07:29.757]  I mean, a lot of stuff you buy from China is people making maybe, you know, 20, 30 cents an hour, basically what American prisoners make.
[02:07:30.498 --> 02:07:33.300]  But at least they're just prisoners to the society and the economy.
[02:07:33.320 --> 02:07:34.320]  They can at least go home.
[02:07:35.441 --> 02:07:41.265]  Walmart goes to the next level, and they're one of the predominant buyers of the prison industry goods over there.
[02:07:42.293 --> 02:07:56.438]  Also, the schools in China, in a lot of the urban and even rural areas, you go to school four or five hours a day, but the rest of the time after lunch, you know, you then stay from, you know, noon until nine at night working a factory.
[02:07:59.452 --> 02:08:02.593]  And quote, that's what pays for your government schooling.
[02:08:02.653 --> 02:08:04.113]  Isn't it wonderful to have government schooling?
[02:08:04.133 --> 02:08:05.113]  Aren't they doing you a favor?
[02:08:05.133 --> 02:08:10.255]  And you always hear about, you know, some fireworks factory blows up and 300 kids get burned up, get a little bitty.
[02:08:10.535 --> 02:08:13.575]  We're talking six, seven-year-olds rolling the firecrackers.
[02:08:13.635 --> 02:08:15.796]  I mean, this is out of control.
[02:08:15.996 --> 02:08:18.817]  But what Walmart does domestically really is racketeering.
[02:08:19.817 --> 02:08:28.179]  We've had guests on the last four or five years covering this, but even Frontline had a special one that I saw some online clips of, and I read the synopsis, and I'm told it's pretty good.
[02:08:29.167 --> 02:08:33.129]  Where they show how Walmart racketeers.
[02:08:33.789 --> 02:08:40.852]  They go to their suppliers and they say, OK, we're not going to buy from you unless it's this low.
[02:08:41.152 --> 02:08:43.093]  And the person says, well, that's below cost.
[02:08:44.253 --> 02:08:46.314]  And they say, well, that's OK.
[02:08:46.414 --> 02:08:48.635]  You can use us to tool up your facility.
[02:08:49.095 --> 02:08:51.796]  And if you upgrade, then you can charge all your competition more.
[02:08:52.276 --> 02:08:56.938]  And basically, the amount of money we're going to give you is so large that you can then
[02:08:59.289 --> 02:08:59.889]  We're good to go.
[02:09:16.431 --> 02:09:31.035]  And they also go into counties and they say, give us zero taxation, in fact, even pay to bring Walmart to your small town, or we will build right outside your city limits, right on the edge of the county, and then you'll get nothing.
[02:09:31.615 --> 02:09:32.735]  And so they'll capitulate.
[02:09:32.755 --> 02:09:35.656]  I mean, they know what they're doing.
[02:09:36.588 --> 02:09:41.170]  And Wal-Mart really does hurt the economies, hurt the society around them.
[02:09:42.010 --> 02:09:43.071]  All of the evidence shows.
[02:09:43.111 --> 02:09:45.852]  But then, Wal-Mart's been caught and convicted.
[02:09:45.892 --> 02:09:51.454]  And folks, I worked for Wal-Mart about four or five months one time in the auto department.
[02:09:51.994 --> 02:09:53.815]  I think I was actually still in high school then.
[02:09:53.835 --> 02:09:54.655]  It was part-time.
[02:09:55.635 --> 02:09:56.756]  And it was right here in Austin.
[02:09:57.825 --> 02:10:05.847]  And I worked at that Walmart in the auto parts department, and it would be five o'clock, time for me to leave, or actually I'd get there after high school, so maybe eight, nine o'clock, I don't remember.
[02:10:05.887 --> 02:10:10.769]  I was working part-time because they only really wanted part-time employees anyways, but I was a part-time employee.
[02:10:11.249 --> 02:10:13.470]  And he'd say, all right, those trucks came with those batteries.
[02:10:13.510 --> 02:10:14.470]  You've clocked out, right?
[02:10:14.530 --> 02:10:15.270]  Yeah, I've clocked out.
[02:10:15.610 --> 02:10:17.731]  I want you to go unload those 200 batteries.
[02:10:17.791 --> 02:10:21.332]  And folks, I mean, they didn't even have equipment to unload them, like little businesses do.
[02:10:21.972 --> 02:10:25.375]  You would just climb up, basically, and just set the batteries down.
[02:10:25.715 --> 02:10:28.297]  The batteries were so cheap, I'd never seen batteries that leak.
[02:10:28.617 --> 02:10:33.161]  But the Walmart brand would have water coming out of the top of them, the battery acid would be burning my hands.
[02:10:34.722 --> 02:10:37.905]  And after a few months of that, I just said, listen, I'm not going to do that anymore.
[02:10:37.925 --> 02:10:39.366]  And the guy got real mad about it.
[02:10:41.167 --> 02:10:46.652]  And, of course, he didn't have anybody else working for him because he couldn't get anybody to be that stupid as I was, and I just quit.
[02:10:47.538 --> 02:11:01.963]  So you've got to imagine, it was weird for me years later, decades later, to then hear that Walmart has done that nationwide with their associates.
[02:11:02.123 --> 02:11:13.427]  I mean, imagine you go work there at, you know, six, seven dollars an hour, as if anybody can live on that, and then the scumbags want an hour or two every day extra from you.
[02:11:14.798 --> 02:11:18.960]  I mean, imagine these big trucks are pulling in with tires and batteries, and I was working constantly.
[02:11:18.980 --> 02:11:23.143]  I mean, it was a major league, just gigantic hassle.
[02:11:23.823 --> 02:11:28.065]  And then you're working, and I don't want to hear, hey, it's free market, you've got to get used to it, you know, tough it out.
[02:11:28.386 --> 02:11:31.627]  We walked to school uphill both ways through 55 feet of snow.
[02:11:33.383 --> 02:11:33.783]  Bull.
[02:11:34.363 --> 02:11:36.724]  People in America did have to work hard.
[02:11:36.764 --> 02:11:38.705]  There was some problems with sharecroppers and others.
[02:11:39.125 --> 02:11:46.467]  But on average, if you were willing to work hard and save money and didn't go drink it or spend it on prostitutes or spend it on gambling, you would become wealthy.
[02:11:46.867 --> 02:11:48.087]  Or you would become middle class.
[02:11:48.127 --> 02:11:49.068]  You would become comfortable.
[02:11:49.448 --> 02:12:00.471]  One person could work and put both of their children through school at an upper blue collar job, go on a couple of vacations every year, and live pretty well, and then retire.
[02:12:02.618 --> 02:12:03.766]  That's not the case anymore.
[02:12:03.887 --> 02:12:05.095]  I know so many people.
[02:12:06.158 --> 02:12:10.000]  With two or three degrees working at H-E-B and mowing yards.
[02:12:10.020 --> 02:12:15.223]  You know, they'll bag groceries at night and go mow yards during the day and their wife's doing the same thing.
[02:12:15.483 --> 02:12:21.186]  And the government handbooks, the government documents said they wanted to break up the family, make sure the children were in school.
[02:12:21.546 --> 02:12:27.670]  Now there's after school programs where the kids stay there until 8 o'clock at night so you can have a few hours to maybe go drink some brew.
[02:12:28.190 --> 02:12:28.550]  You see?
[02:12:28.590 --> 02:12:33.593]  And so you see your kid for two hours at night when you get home and they're watching TV and you're watching TV.
[02:12:34.969 --> 02:12:36.430]  We're not parents anymore!
[02:12:38.712 --> 02:12:41.694]  Parents don't care about their child's tennis scores.
[02:12:42.054 --> 02:12:45.356]  They give their child Nike tennis shoes made by slaves.
[02:12:45.737 --> 02:12:46.797]  That's the status symbol.
[02:12:46.898 --> 02:12:47.678]  Oh, I love you.
[02:12:47.878 --> 02:12:51.421]  Here's a piece of junk, ugly tennis shoes that were made by slaves.
[02:12:51.541 --> 02:12:52.021]  I love you.
[02:12:52.602 --> 02:12:56.544]  Oh, we're broke, but I got you $2,000 Rose Bowl tickets.
[02:12:56.584 --> 02:12:57.985]  We're all flying out as a family.
[02:12:58.005 --> 02:12:59.346]  We're charging it on credit cards.
[02:12:59.627 --> 02:13:02.789]  We've just got to have this personal victory in our lives.
[02:13:03.692 --> 02:13:08.934]  You're going to end up in prison, son, or with AIDS, or on crack cocaine, but it doesn't matter.
[02:13:09.314 --> 02:13:10.734]  I'm going to take you to the Rose Bowl.
[02:13:11.815 --> 02:13:15.516]  Okay, I'm going to just blast through four or five more calls, and then I've got to get to the news.
[02:13:15.536 --> 02:13:17.576]  The clips, the news, it's all stacking up.
[02:13:17.697 --> 02:13:18.217]  Now, you know what?
[02:13:18.277 --> 02:13:19.837]  I'm just going to hold off on calls right now.
[02:13:20.397 --> 02:13:25.879]  Eric, and Dwight, and John, everybody else, we'll get to you, but I've got to go ahead and get into news here.
[02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:31.381]  By the way, I wasn't just trying to be negative just now.
[02:13:32.933 --> 02:13:35.376]  The test scores, we were number one 50 years ago.
[02:13:35.456 --> 02:13:39.920]  We're behind every industrialized country, behind 30-something third world countries.
[02:13:39.940 --> 02:13:40.501]  We're a joke.
[02:13:41.342 --> 02:13:43.904]  We were the most solvent, had the biggest savings in the world.
[02:13:43.925 --> 02:13:45.326]  We are now the most in debt.
[02:13:46.807 --> 02:13:49.250]  On average, poorest people in the industrialized world.
[02:13:49.550 --> 02:13:52.934]  There's still a lot of wealth here, but most of it's trappings of wealth.
[02:13:53.721 --> 02:13:54.742]  Trappings of wealth.
[02:13:54.762 --> 02:14:02.187]  People have got to be in debt so they can live in the $400,000 house and drive the big SUV, but they're really in debt living paycheck to paycheck.
[02:14:02.827 --> 02:14:04.308]  Okay, I'm going to shut up about that.
[02:14:04.368 --> 02:14:07.150]  It was all done by design.
[02:14:08.611 --> 02:14:12.493]  You may not have anything in your future, but you've got a Rose Bowl championship shirt.
[02:14:12.513 --> 02:14:15.095]  Again, I'm not bashing that in and of itself.
[02:14:15.175 --> 02:14:17.337]  It's like a religion.
[02:14:17.397 --> 02:14:18.197]  It's like a cult.
[02:14:18.257 --> 02:14:19.678]  It's like Kool-Aid drinking now.
[02:14:20.799 --> 02:14:22.300]  Just nothing matters but that.
[02:14:23.083 --> 02:14:23.804]  Yeah, I'm going to shut up.
[02:14:23.844 --> 02:14:24.204]  That's it.
[02:14:25.625 --> 02:14:29.007]  Let me go ahead and just play this clip and we'll go to a break and come back and comment on it.
[02:14:29.267 --> 02:14:40.996]  Arnold Spector is a total slime ball and the elite knows they're in so much trouble now that they may sacrifice Bush politically and start some impeachment shenanigan that will actually boost Bush's approval ratings.
[02:14:41.036 --> 02:14:45.519]  You see, when Al Gore comes out and says that
[02:14:46.753 --> 02:14:50.596]  We need to stop the police state and Bush butchering the Constitution.
[02:14:50.976 --> 02:14:57.981]  You see, now he's labeling it, he's branding it as a Democratic issue and Bill Clinton and Al Gore helped dismantle the Constitution.
[02:14:58.461 --> 02:15:04.566]  Then Republicans say, well, see, dismantling the Constitution is good because the evil Al Gore is against it.
[02:15:06.927 --> 02:15:13.452]  Or, worse yet, you know, just the whole program just continues to just move on down the road
[02:15:15.197 --> 02:15:15.978]  So that's what they do.
[02:15:15.998 --> 02:15:26.447]  But now they have Arlen Specter, the guy that, you know, the magic bullet theory that says it shot through three bones in a metal seat and then hit Kennedy and didn't even bend the bullet.
[02:15:26.667 --> 02:15:30.370]  Well, now he's saying maybe impeachment is needed.
[02:15:31.271 --> 02:15:34.094]  Let's go ahead and roll that clip from him on the national TV.
[02:15:35.094 --> 02:15:36.896]  Let me turn to the issue of domestic spying.
[02:15:36.916 --> 02:15:39.600]  You're going to be chairing those hearings starting early next month.
[02:15:39.620 --> 02:15:48.293]  And while you were conducting the Alito hearings, Brian Ross of ABC did an exclusive interview with a whistleblower at the National Security Agency named Russell Tice.
[02:15:48.313 --> 02:15:49.575]  Let me show you part of what he had to say.
[02:15:50.756 --> 02:15:56.200]  From a very young age in our career, it's drummed into your head that you will not spy against Americans.
[02:15:56.280 --> 02:15:58.342]  And that was the number one commandment of the Ten Commandments.
[02:15:58.382 --> 02:16:03.806]  But you're saying you saw things and are aware of things that were done unlawfully at the NSA?
[02:16:04.066 --> 02:16:05.006]  I believe so, yes.
[02:16:05.647 --> 02:16:07.948]  Mr. Tice wants to testify before Congress.
[02:16:07.968 --> 02:16:08.549]  Will you call him?
[02:16:09.827 --> 02:16:12.529]  I would consider it before making a decision.
[02:16:12.569 --> 02:16:17.092]  I want to talk to him on an informal basis to see what he has to say.
[02:16:17.172 --> 02:16:20.815]  But in my closing statement on Friday,
[02:16:21.964 --> 02:16:37.059]  In the Alito hearings, I said flatly that I thought the administration contention that the resolution authorizing the use of force did not contain an implicit authorization to modify the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
[02:16:37.079 --> 02:16:42.084]  That if that's what the administration was relying on, I thought they were wrong.
[02:16:42.124 --> 02:16:44.927]  Now, we're going to have broader issues, George.
[02:16:44.967 --> 02:16:46.128]  We're going to get into the point
[02:16:46.548 --> 02:16:47.488]  We'll come back to that.
[02:16:47.649 --> 02:16:51.750]  Article 2, Section 2 clearly says he's a traitor if he does anything to the American people.
[02:16:51.850 --> 02:16:57.292]  It doesn't allow the President to go around and rob banks or, you know, raid SNLs or torture people or do anything else.
[02:16:57.312 --> 02:16:58.413]  It holds them to a higher standard.
[02:17:16.357 --> 02:17:18.838]  And so he's declaring martial law dictatorial powers.
[02:17:18.858 --> 02:17:22.499]  And Specter goes on to say that, you know, there could be an impeachment.
[02:17:22.919 --> 02:17:23.660]  It won't matter.
[02:17:23.700 --> 02:17:24.780]  Bush is just a puppet.
[02:17:24.820 --> 02:17:25.920]  Bush is running nothing.
[02:17:26.621 --> 02:17:29.702]  You know, Republicans point their finger and go, well, look, Clinton did all that, too.
[02:17:30.342 --> 02:17:31.683]  Meanwhile, Clinton's supporting the war.
[02:17:31.863 --> 02:17:32.383]  Exactly.
[02:17:32.403 --> 02:17:33.603]  They're all bought and paid for.
[02:17:34.183 --> 02:17:35.844]  That's how bad this has gotten.
[02:17:37.045 --> 02:17:39.846]  So, I mean, Arnold Specter is just going to whitewash the whole thing.
[02:17:39.866 --> 02:17:40.366]  Just watch.
[02:17:40.386 --> 02:17:40.946]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:44.830 --> 02:17:49.212]  Did you know that heart disease is the number one killer of men and women in the United States?
[02:17:49.652 --> 02:17:58.757]  In fact, the National Cholesterol Education Program has reported that each year more than a million Americans have heart attacks and about a half a million die from heart disease.
[02:17:59.157 --> 02:18:05.120]  Did you also know that the higher your blood cholesterol level, the greater your risk for developing heart disease or having a heart attack?
[02:18:05.740 --> 02:18:25.067]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we are aware of the controversies surrounding the presumed safety of statin drugs in lowering cholesterol, which is why, as part of our ongoing commitment to your safety and health, we invite you to learn more about Google by Himalaya, a highly effective and extremely safe natural herbal supplement, widely recognized for its cholesterol-regulating properties.

[02:18:35.543 --> 02:18:35.844]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[02:18:35.864 --> 02:18:36.464]  Currency devaluation.
[02:18:36.484 --> 02:18:36.825]  Inflation.
[02:18:36.845 --> 02:18:37.545]  One and the same.
[02:18:53.675 --> 02:19:03.518]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:19:03.938 --> 02:19:07.060]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:19:07.320 --> 02:19:08.740]  The bank paid you 1%.
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:12.241]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:19:12.781 --> 02:19:15.002]  Here is reality.
[02:19:15.362 --> 02:19:18.944]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:19:19.444 --> 02:19:23.065]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:19:23.635 --> 02:19:27.397]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[02:19:27.837 --> 02:19:31.539]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.
[02:19:31.919 --> 02:19:33.400]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:33.420 --> 02:19:33.660]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:44.056 --> 02:19:52.679]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:19:52.900 --> 02:20:04.164]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:20:04.384 --> 02:20:07.045]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:20:07.385 --> 02:20:11.487]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[02:20:11.687 --> 02:20:13.830]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:20:13.990 --> 02:20:15.872]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:20:16.073 --> 02:20:22.100]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[02:20:22.341 --> 02:20:28.008]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[02:20:32.993 --> 02:20:33.693]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:20:44.321 --> 02:20:45.801]  Hey folks, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:20:46.142 --> 02:20:50.103]  You've all heard me on the radio talking about the importance of investing in precious metals.
[02:20:50.483 --> 02:20:54.004]  I feel it's time for me to talk about the importance of investing in your health.
[02:20:54.384 --> 02:20:57.945]  I was presented with the opportunity to try Tri-Vibes from TriVortex.
[02:20:58.325 --> 02:21:03.187]  I was a bit hesitant of the idea of absorbing vitamins by wearing them rather than ingesting them.
[02:21:03.527 --> 02:21:09.310]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[02:21:09.630 --> 02:21:13.332]  I now wear my TriVibes bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever.
[02:21:13.692 --> 02:21:15.773]  Not only physically, but also mentally.
[02:21:16.093 --> 02:21:21.876]  TriVortex also offers amazingly beneficial and beautiful jewelry worn by the women around the office daily.
[02:21:22.296 --> 02:21:23.476]  TriVortex is amazing.
[02:21:23.797 --> 02:21:24.917]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:21:24.997 --> 02:21:30.419]  Try TriVortex yourself and have fun and learn with the tests found on TriVortex.com.
[02:21:30.619 --> 02:21:34.080]  That's T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com.
[02:21:34.360 --> 02:21:35.681]  Or call my friend Brian at 619-884-1455.
[02:21:35.701 --> 02:21:35.981]  That's 619-884-1455.
[02:21:51.460 --> 02:21:52.781]  Serious business.
[02:21:53.201 --> 02:22:14.916]  So, the scam, the theater that Spector and others bring forward, and by the way, Bush pushed for Spector to get that committee chairmanship, he won't be convincing unless he acts like it's serious, but then he'll, well, I find this to be a problem, but I guess you do have imperial executive total control.
[02:22:15.196 --> 02:22:17.257]  I mean, watch what comes out of these hearings.
[02:22:17.898 --> 02:22:19.379]  Continue with Arlen Spector.
[02:22:21.249 --> 02:22:22.069]  To the contrary.
[02:22:22.149 --> 02:22:41.019]  Let me pick up on that, because there was a lot of talk about that at the Alito hearings, and listening closely to you and your questioning, I certainly seem to take away that you believe the President does not have the right, does not have the inherent power under the Constitution to circumvent a constitutional law, and as far as you're concerned, the FISA law is constitutional, isn't it?
[02:22:41.419 --> 02:22:49.743]  Well, I started off by saying that he didn't have the authority under the resolution authorizing the use of force.
[02:22:50.623 --> 02:22:53.124]  The President has to follow the Constitution.
[02:22:54.284 --> 02:23:07.449]  Where you have a law which is constitutional, like Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, there still may be collateral different powers in the President under wartime circumstances.
[02:23:07.489 --> 02:23:12.250]  That's a very naughty question that I'm not prepared to answer on a Sunday soundbite.
[02:23:12.290 --> 02:23:15.571]  But I do believe that it ought to be thoroughly examined.
[02:23:15.791 --> 02:23:17.632]  And when we were on the Patriots Act,
[02:23:18.232 --> 02:23:21.795]  And found the disclosure of the surveillance.
[02:23:21.915 --> 02:23:29.501]  I immediately said the Judiciary Committee would hold hearings and I talked to the Attorney General and we're going to explore in depth, George.
[02:23:29.521 --> 02:23:30.562]  You can count on that.
[02:23:30.702 --> 02:23:34.305]  You know, if the President did break the law or circumvent the law, what's the remedy?
[02:23:35.237 --> 02:23:41.183]  Well, the remedy could be a variety of things.
[02:23:42.244 --> 02:23:48.490]  President, and I'm not suggesting remotely that there's any basis, but you're asking really theory, what's the remedy?
[02:23:49.070 --> 02:23:50.291]  Impeachment is the remedy.
[02:23:50.391 --> 02:23:51.733]  After impeachment, you could have a
[02:23:53.194 --> 02:23:54.955]  A criminal prosecution.
[02:23:55.315 --> 02:23:57.537]  So after impeachment you have a criminal prosecution.
[02:23:58.057 --> 02:23:58.818]  It doesn't matter.
[02:23:58.858 --> 02:24:04.722]  The elite could burn 500 George Bushes, a million Specters, five billion Bill Clintons and Hillaries.
[02:24:04.822 --> 02:24:05.983]  It doesn't matter.
[02:24:07.131 --> 02:24:18.895]  We have large financial institutions that are not free market, that use government to funnel our tax money into their troughs, that are turning America into a police state and marching us off to more and more wars.
[02:24:19.275 --> 02:24:24.717]  They've stated it in their Rand Corporation and PNAC and Project for a New American Century documents.
[02:24:25.717 --> 02:24:27.257]  There's no ifs, ands, or buts about it.
[02:24:27.337 --> 02:24:31.379]  Bush and the neocons are executing it, and they're like birdcage liners.
[02:24:31.439 --> 02:24:32.579]  They take all the heat,
[02:24:33.416 --> 02:24:42.826]  The American people get mad at them, which I'm not saying it's bad to be mad at them, but don't be mad at the red cape that gets dangled in front of you.
[02:24:42.886 --> 02:24:49.352]  If you're going to be a raging bull, get smart and go around the red cape and gore the matador.
[02:24:50.173 --> 02:24:52.115]  I mean, it's really that simple.
[02:24:52.816 --> 02:24:56.680]  And so you watch, out of this, Specter's going to say, well, I condemn what you did, but
[02:24:58.058 --> 02:25:00.339]  On this footing, but you can hear where he's going.
[02:25:00.639 --> 02:25:02.060]  He's their whitewash man.
[02:25:02.100 --> 02:25:05.621]  He's been running whitewashes in the Senate for twenty-something years.
[02:25:06.361 --> 02:25:08.662]  And that's all Arlen Specter does.
[02:25:09.782 --> 02:25:11.643]  And I tell you, you talk about somebody they prop up.
[02:25:11.663 --> 02:25:12.923]  I mean, how many brain surgeries?
[02:25:13.243 --> 02:25:14.324]  It's like Dick Cheney.
[02:25:15.104 --> 02:25:21.986]  But they just literally roll him out like Darth Vader, and then he always says, oh, people are going to get in trouble, and then he authorizes all of it.
[02:25:22.226 --> 02:25:23.627]  Well, you can't authorize it.
[02:25:23.687 --> 02:25:24.507]  If Bush was caught
[02:25:25.433 --> 02:25:31.896]  Snorting cocaine on the White House lawn by video cameras, he couldn't say, I can snort cocaine because I'm in a time of war.
[02:25:34.797 --> 02:25:50.804]  Meanwhile, report MS-13 gang hired to murder Border Patrol, Daily Bulletin, secret border wars, mayhem and terror in Southwest states to protect government drug cartels, flashback, former DEA agent, Mexican commandos killing in Southwest to protect Bush drug cartel.
[02:25:52.083 --> 02:25:53.624]  Then I've got this out of Orland Daily.
[02:25:53.724 --> 02:25:55.504]  Mexican troops defiant border.
[02:25:55.925 --> 02:25:56.445]  What border?
[02:25:56.465 --> 02:25:57.605]  And our government supports it.
[02:25:57.925 --> 02:26:00.966]  Military crosses into America 216 times.
[02:26:01.447 --> 02:26:05.928]  The Mexican military has little regard for the border as troops have entered the United States 216 times.
[02:26:06.369 --> 02:26:09.150]  According to the Department of Homeland Security and a map of incursions.
[02:26:09.190 --> 02:26:10.050]  That's just what they admit.
[02:26:10.743 --> 02:26:13.686]  California's Inland Valley Daily Bulletin says U.S.
[02:26:13.726 --> 02:26:20.233]  officials claim the border crossings are designed to help foreign drug and human smugglers gain safe access to American territory.
[02:26:20.633 --> 02:26:22.075]  El Centro, 58 times.
[02:26:22.515 --> 02:26:24.217]  San Diego County, 17 times.
[02:26:24.257 --> 02:26:25.559]  Yuma, Arizona, 24 times.
[02:26:25.899 --> 02:26:27.381]  Tucson, Arizona, 39 times.
[02:26:27.441 --> 02:26:28.842]  El Paso, 33 times.
[02:26:29.883 --> 02:26:30.664]  Marfa, Texas, 8.
[02:26:31.064 --> 02:26:31.705]  Del Rio, 3.
[02:26:32.606 --> 02:26:33.067]  Laredo, 6.
[02:26:34.116 --> 02:26:36.477]  And then Rio Grande Valley, 28 times.
[02:26:36.817 --> 02:26:42.680]  And they've got all these sheriffs and feds here saying they'll march up to them, aim machine guns at them, and save the drug dealers.
[02:26:42.720 --> 02:26:43.461]  Of course they do!
[02:26:44.301 --> 02:26:45.922]  The number is 216.
[02:26:46.042 --> 02:26:50.584]  It's 20 times larger than even the Minuteman Project organizers are aware of, said Jim Gilchrist.
[02:26:51.245 --> 02:26:51.885]  And it goes on.
[02:26:52.005 --> 02:26:59.169]  One border agent, speaking on a condition of anonymity, told the Bulletin, We've had armed showdowns with the Mexican Army.
[02:26:59.409 --> 02:27:01.050]  These aren't just ex-military guys.
[02:27:01.070 --> 02:27:03.551]  These are Mexican Army officials.
[02:27:04.728 --> 02:27:05.929]  Assisting drug smugglers.
[02:27:06.670 --> 02:27:07.490]  O fish owls.
[02:27:07.510 --> 02:27:09.011]  See, they're not government servants down there.
[02:27:09.051 --> 02:27:09.812]  It's Napoleonic.
[02:27:10.392 --> 02:27:11.053]  They're not servants.
[02:27:11.073 --> 02:27:12.174]  They're O fish owls.
[02:27:12.834 --> 02:27:17.878]  With Mexico's government dispute the findings, claiming not a single crossing has been made by its troops.
[02:27:19.759 --> 02:27:24.442]  Meanwhile, they're saying that all their illegals are legal, and how dare America try to build a fence.
[02:27:24.863 --> 02:27:31.948]  They've told their illegal alien people to go into high gear, and Mexican troops are committing assassinations all over Texas and car bombings.
[02:27:33.931 --> 02:27:36.917]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:37.859 --> 02:27:40.544]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:43.832 --> 02:27:46.853]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:27:47.153 --> 02:27:52.095]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:27:52.335 --> 02:27:56.696]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:27:56.996 --> 02:28:05.899]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:28:06.119 --> 02:28:09.720]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:28:10.020 --> 02:28:15.046]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:28:15.346 --> 02:28:22.094]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:28:22.575 --> 02:28:23.116]  What about you?
[02:28:23.857 --> 02:28:28.759]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35.

[02:28:43.504 --> 02:28:45.467]  Hey, Jack Blood here from Deadline Live.
[02:28:45.527 --> 02:28:48.430]  You know, it seems people will steal anything and everything you have.
[02:28:48.611 --> 02:28:53.998]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there is someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[02:28:54.238 --> 02:28:55.740]  And what about those government agencies?
[02:28:55.800 --> 02:28:58.043]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[02:28:58.223 --> 02:29:01.788]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[02:29:02.108 --> 02:29:02.488]  I don't think so.
[02:29:24.793 --> 02:29:25.494]  We're good to go.
[02:29:43.786 --> 02:29:44.887]  You don't love me anymore?
[02:29:45.227 --> 02:29:47.008]  You used to take such good care of me.
[02:29:47.028 --> 02:29:48.509]  Is that my car talking to me?
[02:29:48.649 --> 02:29:48.949]  Yes.
[02:29:49.250 --> 02:29:50.090]  You neglect me.
[02:29:50.250 --> 02:29:52.232]  Change my oil late most of the time.
[02:29:54.073 --> 02:29:55.073]  Use the cheapest gas.
[02:29:55.414 --> 02:29:56.294]  I'm getting sick.
[02:29:56.614 --> 02:29:58.776]  One of these days, I'm just gonna give up.
[02:29:59.837 --> 02:30:00.318]  Wait a minute.
[02:30:00.398 --> 02:30:02.020]  I've got three more years of payments on you.
[02:30:02.260 --> 02:30:10.830]  If you want me to last forever, you need to add protected engine treatment, protected transmission treatment, and especially protected complete fuel system treatment.
[02:30:11.290 --> 02:30:16.757]  Protected unique synthetic fortifiers treat the metal and the oil to reduce friction like no other.
[02:30:16.777 --> 02:30:19.380]  Okay, I'll add some Protecta, but you'll have to perform.
[02:30:19.520 --> 02:30:24.184]  How about faster acceleration, more horsepower, longer lasting.
[02:30:24.404 --> 02:30:26.085]  I'll always be there for you.
[02:30:26.265 --> 02:30:29.588]  So if you want more, treat it right with Protecta by SFR.
[02:30:29.748 --> 02:30:34.111]  For a special offer of free shipping, go to www.sfrcorp.com or call 888-USE-SFR1.
[02:30:34.211 --> 02:30:35.532]  That's www.sfrcorp.com or call 888-USE-SFR1.
[02:31:00.832 --> 02:31:05.755]  I got a lot of news in a short time to get there and some more clips.
[02:31:10.298 --> 02:31:21.165]  Let's go ahead and roll this new six-piece out of California, where, and we have the text article up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now, where the PlayStation 2 system
[02:31:23.176 --> 02:31:30.841]  Makes the young man, the teenager, go into convulsions basically, start twitching and having problems.
[02:31:30.861 --> 02:31:31.541]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:31:32.136 --> 02:31:35.997]  A video game warning for parents after PlayStation put a child in the hospital.
[02:31:36.317 --> 02:31:43.420]  Nine-year-old Nicholas Lavin started having tremors and his body began to jerk after playing his PlayStation for more than three hours.
[02:31:43.880 --> 02:31:47.641]  San Diego doctors say the game system triggered a mild seizure in the boy.
[02:31:48.022 --> 02:31:52.043]  And they say excessive video game playing could do the same in just about any child.
[02:31:52.443 --> 02:31:54.604]  Here's what doctors say you can do to keep your children safe.
[02:31:54.964 --> 02:31:57.565]  First, limit play to less than an hour at a time.
[02:31:57.925 --> 02:32:03.127]  Keep the lights on in the room and keep your child at least two feet away from the TV screen.
[02:32:04.347 --> 02:32:05.607]  Okay, so notice what they said.
[02:32:05.647 --> 02:32:06.928]  A dark room.
[02:32:07.228 --> 02:32:08.948]  The flickering screen.
[02:32:10.069 --> 02:32:14.810]  Don't let your child play the video games with the lights off.
[02:32:14.890 --> 02:32:17.111]  See, how do you hypnotize somebody in a dark room?
[02:32:19.613 --> 02:32:20.954]  It's a real thing.
[02:32:20.994 --> 02:32:21.834]  It's documented.
[02:32:22.074 --> 02:32:40.323]  It gets overblown in Hollywood and things, but if someone is willing to be or relaxed or suggestible with the swinging coin on the end of a chain or with a flashing strobe light, you can relax someone, get them into a suggestible state,
[02:32:41.687 --> 02:32:44.608]  And then basically have them sleepwalking through life.
[02:32:45.268 --> 02:33:02.554]  People that do sleepwalk, and I only do it occasionally, I mean, I might sleepwalk once a year, and I usually just get up, go to the kitchen, get a glass of water, and it's usually if I go to take like a nap or something in the day, and my sleep's been off or something, my wife will be like, hey, you know, a few times she's seen me walk by and I'm like asleep, she's like, hey, what are you doing?
[02:33:02.574 --> 02:33:04.555]  I'm like, I don't know, and I wake up and go, oh, I was asleep.
[02:33:05.556 --> 02:33:09.901]  That's because you're down in that very low level of consciousness.
[02:33:10.361 --> 02:33:12.804]  Very deep, deep, deep, deep sleep is where that happens.
[02:33:14.826 --> 02:33:20.451]  One time when I was about, I don't know, about 10, my dad heard me run out the front door at like 5 a.m.
[02:33:20.492 --> 02:33:22.113]  and I was running down the street in my pajamas.
[02:33:22.434 --> 02:33:23.995]  Thank God it was the winter.
[02:33:24.035 --> 02:33:25.817]  I'd have been just in my underwear, but I was in pajamas.
[02:33:26.317 --> 02:33:28.099]  Going, I've got to catch the bus, I've got to catch the bus.
[02:33:29.726 --> 02:33:37.411]  I went to public school and we lived in a neighborhood where I had to walk about a quarter mile to where the bus stop came because the bus couldn't go up our hill and turn around.
[02:33:37.591 --> 02:33:38.252]  That doesn't matter.
[02:33:38.292 --> 02:33:42.995]  The point is, my dad's like chasing me through the cold winter day, trying to catch me.
[02:33:43.055 --> 02:33:45.817]  I still remember him waking me up.
[02:33:46.137 --> 02:33:46.898]  I'm standing on the street.
[02:33:46.918 --> 02:33:47.718]  He's like, wake up!
[02:33:47.738 --> 02:33:48.879]  You're like running down the street.
[02:33:50.420 --> 02:33:53.182]  The point is, we all have those areas of our brains.
[02:33:56.298 --> 02:34:02.760]  But television and the subliminal messages, and by the way folks, ad agencies openly admit they put these in there.
[02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:06.742]  It's just like weather control, weather modification is public, but little known.
[02:34:06.782 --> 02:34:09.763]  It's like kind of an open secret, but only for those that have researched it.
[02:34:09.803 --> 02:34:10.343]  It's kind of like
[02:34:11.673 --> 02:34:15.896]  Chemical and biological testing on the American people is declassified in public.
[02:34:15.956 --> 02:34:19.978]  I mean, the government has nerve-gassed people on subways, released bio-weapons on subways.
[02:34:20.018 --> 02:34:22.340]  They've killed their own troops, knowing it would kill them.
[02:34:22.380 --> 02:34:23.700]  Just, oh, let's kill some of our own troops.
[02:34:24.061 --> 02:34:27.823]  That's public, but most people just go, oh, that's a conspiracy.
[02:34:28.563 --> 02:34:32.926]  Remember in Japan, they had to ban the TV show, Pokemon?
[02:34:34.476 --> 02:34:35.376]  Well, not every country.
[02:34:35.416 --> 02:34:38.459]  Different regions and different areas have different screen flicker rates.
[02:34:39.059 --> 02:34:52.149]  For some reason, there were some Japanese TVs that were at a certain flicker rate where the Pokemon, when the eyes would flash on the monster's eyes, thousands of children would start convulsing and flopping around and foam shooting out of their mouth.
[02:34:52.809 --> 02:34:56.051]  I'm sure it was accidental, of course.
[02:34:56.551 --> 02:35:08.318]  Again, I've just been in the UT Psychology Department where there's whole DARPA laboratories with professors that don't teach American young people or students, no, they develop how to flicker the TV set to control you.
[02:35:09.738 --> 02:35:12.200]  And they found that the system that the U.S.
[02:35:12.320 --> 02:35:13.901]  uses is the best for it.
[02:35:14.621 --> 02:35:17.903]  There's major studies out, and they knew this of course 50 years ago when they chose it,
[02:35:18.710 --> 02:35:23.474]  The European flicker model is still suggestible but not as powerful.
[02:35:23.494 --> 02:35:26.896]  That's why you watch TV and you catch yourself kind of shifting off.
[02:35:26.956 --> 02:35:28.357]  I've kind of built an immunity to it.
[02:35:28.978 --> 02:35:31.380]  I really can't watch shows very long or I look away.
[02:35:31.440 --> 02:35:36.444]  I catch myself analyzing things and if you stay conscious, you can beat it.
[02:35:36.864 --> 02:35:38.905]  But the minute you relax, you'll slip into it.
[02:35:40.006 --> 02:35:42.368]  But I remember playing video games.
[02:35:42.608 --> 02:35:43.389]  I had a Nintendo.
[02:35:44.315 --> 02:36:13.634]  And I had a Coleco before that, and I remember playing a game, and to really get through the incredible levels, the really hard levels, say the combat games, which get into the more aggressive areas of the brain, the lower brain, you know, you'd be doing all these complex maneuvers, say jumping over fences and crawling under things and shooting people, and if you didn't do it, there was just an exact way to do it, say at the last level, level 50 or something, and if you didn't do it just exactly right, you would be unable to do it.
[02:36:14.438 --> 02:36:25.463]  So, it's incredible concentration with the flickering screen doing things the brain associates with physical exertion.
[02:36:25.684 --> 02:36:34.828]  There's a disconnect there, and so video games, according to the studies I've seen, shift you into it, especially combat-style games, even faster than watching television.
[02:36:35.308 --> 02:36:41.131]  Because your body normally thinks that if it's having to do calculations to shoot people and jump over things and do things, it's
[02:36:43.493 --> 02:36:44.313]  I think?
[02:37:02.609 --> 02:37:14.098]  And so that's why when you're watching Fox News or CNN there's weird hazes and blue and orange hazes and it'll match the tie they're wearing and lots of stuff scrolling across the screen and flashes and all of that.
[02:37:14.138 --> 02:37:24.666]  That makes it even more suggestible because they'll have different patterns that different areas of the brain, different functions of the brain lock onto that will even put you into that state even faster.
[02:37:28.389 --> 02:37:29.529]  Folks, you think I'm kidding.
[02:37:29.609 --> 02:37:30.090]  I'm not.
[02:37:31.502 --> 02:37:33.003]  There are so many studies on this.
[02:37:33.063 --> 02:37:33.683]  It's ridiculous.
[02:37:33.723 --> 02:37:35.303]  Go take a marketing.
[02:37:35.323 --> 02:37:37.404]  It'll take you a few years to get into advanced marketing.
[02:37:37.424 --> 02:37:42.265]  When you get into advanced marketing, it'll all be about subliminals and catchphrases and PR.
[02:37:43.026 --> 02:37:44.286]  This is propaganda.
[02:37:44.366 --> 02:37:50.528]  So, again, why do you let your children watch four plus hours of TV a day on average?
[02:37:50.548 --> 02:37:51.628]  Adults now watch that much.
[02:37:51.688 --> 02:37:52.208]  It's gone up.
[02:37:52.768 --> 02:37:54.649]  Why do you watch so much television?
[02:37:54.669 --> 02:37:57.050]  I mean, I'll watch a movie once a week, but I'll pick it up.
[02:37:57.070 --> 02:37:58.290]  I'll put it on the DVD player.
[02:37:59.637 --> 02:38:02.760]  And I'll know that I'm giving myself over to a delusion.
[02:38:03.240 --> 02:38:04.241]  I'm conscious of that.
[02:38:05.202 --> 02:38:06.924]  I do not spend my money on it.
[02:38:07.624 --> 02:38:08.785]  And I'm invigorated, too.
[02:38:08.825 --> 02:38:10.807]  I quit watching television about three years ago.
[02:38:10.927 --> 02:38:17.053]  Now, I'll watch a tape you send me, or I'll make my own films, but I really don't sit there and just drool.
[02:38:17.833 --> 02:38:20.596]  You know, just 20, 30 years ago in America,
[02:38:22.446 --> 02:38:25.509]  You'd go outside in an upscale neighborhood, a poor neighborhood, it didn't matter.
[02:38:25.649 --> 02:38:28.312]  Children playing everywhere, running around.
[02:38:28.412 --> 02:38:34.398]  At the end of the street, they'd be playing stickball or hockey or basketball or football.
[02:38:34.778 --> 02:38:36.120]  Now, you hardly ever see it.
[02:38:36.160 --> 02:38:37.921]  When you do, it's like, oh, look, a rarity!
[02:38:38.342 --> 02:38:40.224]  And you drive past the houses.
[02:38:40.244 --> 02:38:41.385]  They all glow blue.
[02:38:41.445 --> 02:38:42.326]  The windows glow blue.
[02:38:42.646 --> 02:38:46.230]  Go up in a high-rise building and look at another apartment high-rise across from you.
[02:38:46.886 --> 02:38:56.187]  There's not life going on, even arguments going on, or cooking going on, or people playing chess going on, or people making love.
[02:38:57.458 --> 02:39:02.301]  You know, something you'd see 50 years ago looking across from one high-rise to another.
[02:39:02.361 --> 02:39:03.682]  Now, it's glowing.
[02:39:03.722 --> 02:39:05.103]  The blue glow.
[02:39:05.383 --> 02:39:08.425]  And again, they found the color blue mesmerizes.
[02:39:08.445 --> 02:39:10.966]  That's why you see blue and orange mixed together.
[02:39:11.167 --> 02:39:12.407]  These are all admitted colors.
[02:39:13.088 --> 02:39:15.369]  That's why the politicians love that blue screen behind them.
[02:39:15.629 --> 02:39:16.110]  It's admitted.
[02:39:16.890 --> 02:39:18.051]  All soothing you.
[02:39:18.391 --> 02:39:19.872]  All relaxing you.
[02:39:20.592 --> 02:39:22.934]  Getting you into that position of trust.
[02:39:23.934 --> 02:39:27.879]  And please don't send me emails saying, why is the background blue on my TV show then?
[02:39:28.639 --> 02:39:31.623]  Obviously, that's what just is adopted in television.
[02:39:31.643 --> 02:39:35.527]  And yes, there's a blue screen behind me when I do the TV show, The Blue Curtain.
[02:39:36.748 --> 02:39:44.257]  But really, those are there and also dual use for chroma key if you ever want to add, you know, like the weatherman images behind you superimposed on the screen.
[02:39:45.635 --> 02:39:47.776]  But that's what this broadcast is about, folks.
[02:39:47.836 --> 02:39:49.977]  It's about the magnitude of the control.
[02:39:50.017 --> 02:39:54.139]  You know, they tell us Iraq's a wonderful place, everybody loves it, and, oh, look, there's a free press over there.
[02:39:54.159 --> 02:39:55.880]  Turns out there's no free press over there.
[02:39:55.900 --> 02:39:59.761]  A editor wrote articles criticizing the occupation.
[02:39:59.781 --> 02:40:03.583]  He was just given 30 years in prison by the government the globalists put in.
[02:40:03.983 --> 02:40:04.924]  Our government did that.
[02:40:05.384 --> 02:40:09.185]  That's what they'd like to do here, if they could just convince you to do it and to accept it.
[02:40:09.225 --> 02:40:09.646]  They do it.
[02:40:09.706 --> 02:40:10.326]  Make no mistake.
[02:40:11.628 --> 02:40:22.254]  And those same fake reporters that are writing articles out of Washington for Iraq, that were even fooling the Iraqis, they said, man, these are good, these are well written, are writing news for our press.
[02:40:22.294 --> 02:40:34.541]  You see, it isn't left or right, it's CIA, it's Defense Department, it's big ad agencies who've got people smarter in the private sector who were government trained in all of this.
[02:40:35.797 --> 02:40:37.557]  I mean, folks, this is in textbooks.
[02:40:37.597 --> 02:40:38.237]  This is admitted.
[02:40:38.457 --> 02:40:40.198]  There are textbooks on how to dumb us down.
[02:40:40.498 --> 02:40:42.658]  Textbooks on how to break up the family.
[02:40:42.718 --> 02:40:50.139]  I mean, the Calhoun Reader, the Bible for social workers says the family's bad, they're going to break it up.
[02:40:53.920 --> 02:40:57.681]  You see, that's what's so frustrating to me, is that there's so much of this.
[02:40:58.941 --> 02:41:02.061]  Look at this, 52% of Americans impeach Bush on wiretaps.
[02:41:02.542 --> 02:41:04.102]  But again, there's a whole other level.
[02:41:04.142 --> 02:41:05.042]  Bush is just a puppet.
[02:41:06.016 --> 02:41:09.277]  How about 52% of Americans want David Rockefeller arrested?
[02:41:10.417 --> 02:41:19.640]  How about 50% want PNAC officials arrested for a conspiracy to create false intelligence and lie to Congress and invade a sovereign, innocent country?
[02:41:19.960 --> 02:41:23.381]  See, those are the real crowds, but they'll minimize all of it to just Bush.
[02:41:24.324 --> 02:41:25.045]  To just a little bit.
[02:41:25.065 --> 02:41:25.505]  Oh, don't worry.
[02:41:25.565 --> 02:41:27.806]  Laura Defense Hubby is spying on Americans.
[02:41:28.347 --> 02:41:38.073]  She says, I think the American people expect the United States government and the President to do what they can to make sure there's not an attack by foreign terrorists.
[02:41:39.314 --> 02:41:40.815]  She said in a speech in West Africa.
[02:41:42.316 --> 02:41:46.179]  Folks, again, the government openly is admittedly spying on us.
[02:41:47.020 --> 02:41:52.384]  But they minimize the national debate to, well, should we be able to intercept foreign calls to protect you?
[02:41:52.864 --> 02:41:57.367]  To now introduce it to the NSA and the public and tell the cops and everybody it's normal.
[02:41:57.608 --> 02:42:02.971]  See, this is a coming out, and Bush's job as the actor is to take the blame.
[02:42:04.292 --> 02:42:07.735]  Here's one, Secret Service stalks peace demonstrators through DC streets.
[02:42:09.153 --> 02:42:09.533]  D.C.
[02:42:09.613 --> 02:42:10.093]  anti-war.
[02:42:10.113 --> 02:42:18.735]  And then it mentions all the mainstream news articles admitting that the Secret Service just follows anti-war people around harassing them, telling the police to arrest them and not allowing them to demonstrate.
[02:42:18.995 --> 02:42:27.616]  And the Secret Service shows up in Knoxville, Tennessee, excuse me, Nashville, Tennessee, and tells the guy that owns the coffee shop, don't put any anti-Bush signs up in your window.
[02:42:27.876 --> 02:42:29.477]  We don't want that there when he drives by.
[02:42:29.497 --> 02:42:32.357]  And the guy goes, well I was a Bush supporter, but I'm not now.
[02:42:32.437 --> 02:42:33.357]  I got a First Amendment.
[02:42:34.058 --> 02:42:36.278]  You see, I mean, this is how, here's another one, Pentagon,
[02:42:37.719 --> 02:42:38.500]  This is the New York Times.
[02:42:38.540 --> 02:42:42.405]  Pentagon, UC Santa Cruz, student protest, a credible threat to national security.
[02:42:42.826 --> 02:42:46.751]  The protest was carefully orchestrated, planned for weeks, but students against war during Friday.
[02:42:47.581 --> 02:42:52.305]  Evening meetings in a mall in a small classroom on the University of California campus there.
[02:42:52.705 --> 02:43:11.560]  So when the military recruiters arrived for the job fair held in an old dining hall last April, a now fateful day of the scandalized university, the students had their two-day radios in position, their cycles checking into traffic for hundreds of demonstrators marched up the hilly roads of the campus on the Central Coast.
[02:43:12.701 --> 02:43:14.423]  And guess what was going on while that happened?
[02:43:14.443 --> 02:43:15.744]  The Pentagon was watching them.
[02:43:16.326 --> 02:43:22.169]  Got another one here, where the NSA used local police to spy on peace groups.
[02:43:22.189 --> 02:43:26.912]  The NSA, not just listening to your phone calls, folks, but following people around.
[02:43:28.493 --> 02:43:35.517]  Here's one out of the eHealth Insider, and it says, a furor over Patriot Act, power to seize records.
[02:43:36.077 --> 02:43:37.158]  Doctors in the U.S.
[02:43:37.198 --> 02:43:43.782]  have reacted angrily to news that patients' medical records could be seized for investigation without warrant of probable cause under the Patriot Act.
[02:43:44.748 --> 02:43:49.432]  Every time you get a prescription, it's instantly uploaded to Homeland Security.
[02:43:51.414 --> 02:43:53.156]  The NSA is listening to you?
[02:43:53.196 --> 02:43:53.656]  What do you mean?
[02:43:53.756 --> 02:43:54.917]  Everything's being uploaded.
[02:43:56.118 --> 02:43:57.219]  Here's an example.
[02:43:57.559 --> 02:44:02.203]  I try not to use credit cards buying things just because I'm not going to make it easy to be tracked.
[02:44:02.284 --> 02:44:03.505]  Not that I have anything to hide.
[02:44:04.345 --> 02:44:05.166]  I have privacy.
[02:44:06.347 --> 02:44:10.551]  Well, I went in because I was going on a road trip a few months ago and I went into one of the big chains.
[02:44:12.521 --> 02:44:17.223]  And I went in there and I bought two books on tape.
[02:44:18.584 --> 02:44:20.705]  And guess what I got in the mail this weekend?
[02:44:21.786 --> 02:44:22.146]  Saturday.
[02:44:22.837 --> 02:44:33.347]  I got the big history book club and then I looked back and went online and found out the very bookstore that I bought those from basically owns that particular book club.
[02:44:33.768 --> 02:44:35.990]  And of course, it didn't matter that I used my credit card.
[02:44:36.010 --> 02:44:37.952]  It didn't matter that I didn't fill out any form.
[02:44:38.232 --> 02:44:39.413]  They knew I bought history.
[02:44:39.673 --> 02:44:43.196]  That was attached to my data and my address and I got that thing sent to me in the mail.
[02:44:44.718 --> 02:44:45.078]  You see?
[02:44:45.639 --> 02:44:47.701]  And that's all hooked right into the government too, folks.
[02:44:48.963 --> 02:44:54.886]  And whenever you hear that Homeland Security goes to the libraries to see what you've read, they also go to bookstores, folks, for those records.
[02:44:55.547 --> 02:45:00.569]  Now see, where's your free society when that's happening and that's going on?
[02:45:03.291 --> 02:45:05.992]  And it's just amazing.
[02:45:07.009 --> 02:45:10.513]  Let's say I want to go buy Mein Kampf, which I lost my copy.
[02:45:10.533 --> 02:45:14.157]  I want to re-read Adolf Hitler's My Struggle to understand propaganda and what happened.
[02:45:14.437 --> 02:45:17.700]  The idiots all, you know, one time I bought it and they freaked out I was buying it at a bookstore.
[02:45:17.740 --> 02:45:19.102]  It was on a mall back in high school.
[02:45:19.122 --> 02:45:22.045]  Because, you know, if you're reading a book that Hitler wrote, you must like Hitler.
[02:45:22.105 --> 02:45:22.966]  No, I don't like Hitler.
[02:45:22.986 --> 02:45:25.548]  I like to read interesting historical documents.
[02:45:28.073 --> 02:45:41.135]  But I certainly won't use a credit card when I go to buy it, because later it'll be a record show that Jones, who was killed by the SWAT team, you know, something like that in the future, God forbid, he also had bought a book written by Hitler!
[02:45:41.535 --> 02:45:49.817]  And the average American is so dumbed down, they'll be like, Hitler, yeah, Hitler books!
[02:45:50.277 --> 02:45:51.177]  Yeah, Hitler books!
[02:45:52.577 --> 02:45:53.978]  You see, that's how they work, folks.
[02:45:54.018 --> 02:45:56.078]  I'm dead someday and they've got my reading records.
[02:45:59.068 --> 02:46:08.532]  I mean, I've been offered a lot of money for the folks that buy videos from me, but if I wanted to sell them, I couldn't, which I've refused every time, because guess what happens?
[02:46:08.552 --> 02:46:14.254]  It becomes a problem, though, when you call up two months later saying you've got a problem with your order, because it goes in a shredder.
[02:46:14.274 --> 02:46:18.275]  It goes... I don't care!
[02:46:18.355 --> 02:46:21.996]  See, I live by... I walk the walk, folks.
[02:46:22.057 --> 02:46:23.057]  I don't just talk the talk.
[02:46:23.757 --> 02:46:24.557]  Here's one, U.S.
[02:46:24.597 --> 02:46:25.718]  Test E-Passports.
[02:46:27.233 --> 02:46:28.174]  You'll need I.D.
[02:46:28.194 --> 02:46:29.375]  to buy cold medicine.
[02:46:30.695 --> 02:46:31.276]  Real I.D.
[02:46:31.296 --> 02:46:33.017]  and Nightmare for States being implemented.
[02:46:33.037 --> 02:46:33.617]  The National I.D.
[02:46:33.637 --> 02:46:34.478]  card at the state level.
[02:46:34.538 --> 02:46:34.958]  A.P.
[02:46:35.399 --> 02:46:38.401]  DMV officials across country bemoan logistical difficulties.
[02:46:38.981 --> 02:46:40.162]  Can't believe the show's almost over.
[02:46:40.222 --> 02:46:41.703]  I haven't covered a fraction of the news.
[02:46:43.112 --> 02:46:46.536]  An anti-terrorism law creating a national standard for driver's licenses in L.A.
[02:46:46.896 --> 02:46:50.981]  National ID card isn't upsetting just civil libertarians and immigration rights activists.
[02:46:51.041 --> 02:46:55.226]  State motor vehicles officials nationwide, including California, have to carry out the Real ID Act.
[02:46:55.286 --> 02:46:59.010]  And it goes into how we love the National ID card, it's just hard for us.
[02:46:59.531 --> 02:47:02.073]  Don't worry, there's going to be state waivers for the illegal.
[02:47:02.133 --> 02:47:03.295]  See, that's what this is all about.
[02:47:04.769 --> 02:47:06.551]  Protests held over torture flights.
[02:47:07.011 --> 02:47:11.175]  BBC scientists in Taiwan say they have bred three pigs that glow in the dark.
[02:47:11.475 --> 02:47:13.536]  There's video and photos of them up on the website.
[02:47:13.576 --> 02:47:14.677]  They're part jellyfish.
[02:47:15.358 --> 02:47:21.403]  And of course they admit that it could give rise to some deadly super virus that could jump to humans, but still nobody stops these mad scientists.
[02:47:21.423 --> 02:47:22.083]  They just do it.
[02:47:22.383 --> 02:47:26.787]  And then I'm in a pizza place and some guy walks up and taps on the soldier and goes, You're a liar!
[02:47:27.027 --> 02:47:29.089]  There ain't no such thing as spider goats!
[02:47:29.609 --> 02:47:30.810]  I had biology in 1972 at UT!
[02:47:33.402 --> 02:47:34.703]  And I go, sir, just go to the website.
[02:47:34.723 --> 02:47:35.143]  It's admitted.
[02:47:35.163 --> 02:47:38.706]  I mean, this happened to me years ago, but here it is in the news, some new horror.
[02:47:39.266 --> 02:47:40.747]  He was saying they didn't have spider guts.
[02:47:40.767 --> 02:47:41.728]  Well, here's BBC.
[02:47:43.469 --> 02:47:49.573]  Fluorescent pigs, the first in the world, they've been spliced with a jellyfish into a normal pig embryo.
[02:47:50.313 --> 02:47:53.315]  Created by adding genetic material from a jellyfish into a normal pig embryo.
[02:47:53.335 --> 02:47:55.977]  They glow fluorescent green.
[02:47:58.070 --> 02:48:01.333]  Again, and it could just cause any type of super virus or bacteria to rise.
[02:48:01.733 --> 02:48:03.254]  Top scientist on, nobody cares.
[02:48:03.454 --> 02:48:10.840]  Because we live in the age of mercury is good for you and depleted uranium is good for the troops and deadly anthrax shots admittedly have killed masses of them, but so what?
[02:48:10.880 --> 02:48:15.924]  Because supporting the troops means you just put a sticker on your car and really forget the troops and suck your thumb.
[02:48:16.144 --> 02:48:18.366]  Do any of us think we're safe when all this is going on?
[02:48:19.970 --> 02:48:24.933]  It turns out that the cops were told it was a fake gun and they had .50 caliber rifles in there for some reason.
[02:48:25.433 --> 02:48:28.274]  Why would you be running around with .50 caliber rifles inside the school halls?
[02:48:28.554 --> 02:48:32.977]  Because they're just nutcases who never developed into men who just want to go out and kill somebody.
[02:48:34.717 --> 02:48:37.579]  Court ruling allows challenging the Bush faith initiative.
[02:48:38.599 --> 02:48:40.420]  I'll try to come back and jam a bunch of calls in.
[02:48:40.460 --> 02:48:41.741]  There's just so much here.
[02:48:41.781 --> 02:48:43.622]  The Iran war situation.
[02:48:45.037 --> 02:48:47.899]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:48.159 --> 02:48:49.720]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:50.080 --> 02:48:54.743]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:55.084 --> 02:49:01.828]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:49:02.148 --> 02:49:04.129]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:49:04.329 --> 02:49:07.170]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:07.270 --> 02:49:11.932]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:12.133 --> 02:49:16.535]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:16.775 --> 02:49:24.018]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:24.258 --> 02:49:26.679]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[02:49:44.824 --> 02:49:47.828]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:49:48.168 --> 02:49:56.999]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:49:57.319 --> 02:50:02.005]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:50:02.465 --> 02:50:09.167]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:09.587 --> 02:50:21.370]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:50:21.830 --> 02:50:26.292]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[02:50:45.572 --> 02:50:45.852]  I think so.
[02:51:00.919 --> 02:51:01.559]  We're good to go.

[02:51:48.459 --> 02:51:50.361]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:51:50.841 --> 02:51:53.683]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:54.664 --> 02:52:01.249]  It is admitted that cross species plants and animals are extremely toxic to eat.
[02:52:01.549 --> 02:52:01.949]  Deadly.
[02:52:02.490 --> 02:52:03.671]  Screw you up big time.
[02:52:03.691 --> 02:52:04.992]  100% of the time.
[02:52:05.572 --> 02:52:06.813]  It's all over your store shelves.
[02:52:08.134 --> 02:52:09.075]  It is admitted
[02:52:10.695 --> 02:52:11.397]  The D.U.
[02:52:11.477 --> 02:52:12.319]  is killing the troops.
[02:52:12.660 --> 02:52:14.504]  They use it even more all over the place.
[02:52:15.025 --> 02:52:17.351]  Use it right next to major population centers.
[02:52:17.391 --> 02:52:18.573]  Have our troops move into bases.
[02:52:18.594 --> 02:52:19.295]  They bomb with it.
[02:52:21.028 --> 02:52:23.490]  And they just say it isn't true, or, oh, so what?
[02:52:23.591 --> 02:52:27.154]  And then the birth defects explode and everybody gets sick, and it's just, ah, so what?
[02:52:27.394 --> 02:52:27.894]  Support them.
[02:52:28.075 --> 02:52:29.936]  Don't talk about how they're dying or give them support.
[02:52:30.176 --> 02:52:31.117]  That's how you support them.
[02:52:31.338 --> 02:52:33.499]  I mean, that's what's so sick about all this.
[02:52:34.520 --> 02:52:35.822]  This is not hard to figure out.
[02:52:35.862 --> 02:52:41.226]  But see, I'm an expert on politics and the New World Order, just like the general public is an expert on UT football.
[02:52:41.507 --> 02:52:43.849]  See, I don't know all about UT football or their stats.
[02:52:44.549 --> 02:52:48.692]  I could be an expert on that, but then I wouldn't be an expert on the Bill of Rights and Constitution in America.
[02:52:49.132 --> 02:52:51.654]  See, I've chosen what I want to be into.
[02:52:51.814 --> 02:52:56.797]  And occasionally, if the country wasn't going to hell in a handbasket, I would go see a football game.
[02:52:56.837 --> 02:52:58.858]  I'm not against going and seeing a football game.
[02:52:59.358 --> 02:53:05.002]  We just got to get our heads screwed on straight and take care of the priorities first, like a free country.
[02:53:06.585 --> 02:53:07.966]  I mean, you're being propagandized.
[02:53:07.986 --> 02:53:08.786]  You're being brainwashed.
[02:53:08.806 --> 02:53:09.627]  You're being targeted.
[02:53:09.647 --> 02:53:11.368]  You're being financially robbed right now.
[02:53:11.648 --> 02:53:12.828]  The country is folding.
[02:53:13.168 --> 02:53:15.510]  All the economic indicators are bad, folks.
[02:53:16.410 --> 02:53:18.471]  You know, debt and the currency.
[02:53:19.292 --> 02:53:21.713]  I mean, they're admitting you're not going to get your pension funds, nothing.
[02:53:22.133 --> 02:53:23.794]  I mean, it's bad, folks.
[02:53:24.394 --> 02:53:25.275]  It's real bad.
[02:53:26.215 --> 02:53:28.056]  And then they make it a political football.
[02:53:28.096 --> 02:53:29.837]  Well, the Democrats say it isn't bad.
[02:53:31.491 --> 02:53:33.972]  Or the Democrats say it is bad and Republicans say it's good.
[02:53:34.012 --> 02:53:35.672]  Well, you're an evil liberal if you say that.
[02:53:35.992 --> 02:53:37.492]  Folks, the Democrats aren't going to save you.
[02:53:37.552 --> 02:53:39.193]  It's all controlled by the same people.
[02:53:39.493 --> 02:53:43.334]  I know we've got loaded phones and I've got all this other news and I'm just frustrated because we're out of time.
[02:53:43.354 --> 02:53:45.754]  I'm going to try to go to Eric and Dwight.
[02:53:45.794 --> 02:53:47.114]  Sorry to everybody else.
[02:53:48.295 --> 02:53:51.875]  Iran is threatening to block UN inspectors and I'm not defending Iran, folks.
[02:53:51.895 --> 02:53:54.036]  They're just not globalist and that's why they're in trouble.
[02:53:55.681 --> 02:53:56.822]  They have a right to not like us.
[02:53:56.862 --> 02:54:03.548]  We blew up their own buildings and landed on their own government back when it was a peaceful, good government in 1953 and put in the pump at the shop.
[02:54:04.569 --> 02:54:06.270]  But that's all declassified and admitted.
[02:54:06.851 --> 02:54:07.972]  But they saw North Korea.
[02:54:07.992 --> 02:54:12.215]  North Korea says, we'll nuke and kill you, so we grovel and give them food and oil shipments.
[02:54:12.756 --> 02:54:14.737]  Iraq jumps through every hoop and gets invaded.
[02:54:15.098 --> 02:54:16.919]  So they're saying, okay, we're going to do what we want.
[02:54:17.520 --> 02:54:18.981]  Just go ahead and invade, I guess.
[02:54:19.827 --> 02:54:22.609]  So it is just, and the Globalists are talking about attacking him.
[02:54:22.629 --> 02:54:24.329]  They're mashing the air power to do it.
[02:54:24.770 --> 02:54:27.871]  And a lot of armchair quarterbacks just want to see somebody get invaded.
[02:54:28.331 --> 02:54:29.272]  So they're just loving it.
[02:54:30.673 --> 02:54:31.413]  I'm out of time.
[02:54:31.433 --> 02:54:33.914]  We'll just, tomorrow we'll have to get more into this Iran situation.
[02:54:33.974 --> 02:54:35.895]  I'm going to start the show tomorrow with Iran.
[02:54:35.915 --> 02:54:40.318]  And to all the new affiliates and all the old affiliates and all the sponsors, everybody, I love you.
[02:54:40.338 --> 02:54:41.218]  You're doing a great job.
[02:54:41.558 --> 02:54:44.300]  Let's go to Eric in Connecticut.
[02:54:44.340 --> 02:54:44.940]  Eric, go ahead.
[02:54:45.220 --> 02:54:46.721]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:54:47.381 --> 02:54:48.882]  I'll make this short because time is short.
[02:54:49.826 --> 02:54:52.916]  Great thing on Walmart, the high cost of low price is a great expose.
[02:54:53.558 --> 02:54:56.326]  And also I heard somebody ask about Israel and gas prices.
[02:54:56.772 --> 02:55:04.157]  How many people realize that back in the 30s, 40s, and 50s a lot of auto manufacturers had prototype carburetors that were getting 400 miles to the gallon?
[02:55:04.197 --> 02:55:09.621]  There are public carburetors that GM had in the 70s that got 100 miles to the gallon in a big truck.
[02:55:10.281 --> 02:55:13.904]  The Pogue carburetor was available to the public before 1940.
[02:55:14.264 --> 02:55:17.807]  This isn't magic free energy machines that can't be proven one way or the other.
[02:55:17.987 --> 02:55:23.050]  This is admitted, out of the box, real stuff, 100 miles to the gallon, 500 horsepower.
[02:55:24.031 --> 02:55:29.753]  Absolutely, and Sherman tanks during World War II were getting 70 miles to the gallon, and the Horvath device, U.S.
[02:55:29.793 --> 02:55:31.814]  Patent Office, will allow a car to run on water.
[02:55:32.154 --> 02:55:33.815]  So people are being scammed big time, Alex.
[02:55:33.935 --> 02:55:34.615]  Of course they are!
[02:55:34.655 --> 02:55:35.376]  It's all control.
[02:55:35.396 --> 02:55:36.356]  It isn't free market.
[02:55:36.376 --> 02:55:36.996]  Thanks for the call.
[02:55:37.036 --> 02:55:37.797]  Good job.
[02:55:37.817 --> 02:55:39.417]  Delight in Maryland.
[02:55:39.437 --> 02:55:40.138]  Go ahead, Delight.
[02:55:41.738 --> 02:55:41.998]  Hello?
[02:55:42.259 --> 02:55:42.559]  Yes, sir.
[02:55:44.259 --> 02:55:51.762]  Alex, this is a terrible place to be, the last part of the... I have a severe disagreement with you about the way you handle bark in Boston.
[02:55:54.857 --> 02:55:58.861]  I would like to see you become more effective in what you do.
[02:55:59.201 --> 02:56:00.082]  You know, I'm not perfect.
[02:56:00.102 --> 02:56:00.582]  You're right.
[02:56:01.263 --> 02:56:03.605]  I should have let him sing more and hung him and tried to convince him.
[02:56:03.665 --> 02:56:05.306]  It's just so obnoxious.
[02:56:06.367 --> 02:56:07.948]  Sometimes I just get angry, you know?
[02:56:08.368 --> 02:56:13.232]  The fact is that you are not preaching a religion or a dogma.
[02:56:13.292 --> 02:56:15.554]  You're instructing in a reality.
[02:56:16.155 --> 02:56:17.996]  Sometimes it's contagious to do that.
[02:56:18.036 --> 02:56:18.377]  Do this!
[02:56:18.417 --> 02:56:18.717]  Do this!
[02:56:18.757 --> 02:56:20.999]  Call me back tomorrow and get me straight.
[02:56:21.299 --> 02:56:21.980]  God bless you all.
[02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:22.300]  Take care.
