[00:00:05.727 --> 00:00:06.367]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.028 --> 00:00:08.069]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:09.910]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:11.371]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.131 --> 00:00:13.052]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.692 --> 00:00:17.355]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.875 --> 00:00:22.018]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.238 --> 00:00:30.824]  Deep behind enemy lines...
[00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.591]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:33.791 --> 00:00:37.613]  I am Jack Blood, once again filling in for Alex Jones today.
[00:00:37.633 --> 00:00:39.833]  It is the 9th day of June, 2006.
[00:00:40.914 --> 00:00:42.975]  So glad you can join us today, folks.
[00:00:43.135 --> 00:00:50.678]  Alex Jones is, of course, if you haven't heard, if you've been, again, living in a cave somewhere in Afghanistan, even there I think you would probably get some news.
[00:00:51.018 --> 00:00:55.360]  Even there you might know that Alex Jones is covering the Bilderberg Conference in Canada.
[00:00:56.244 --> 00:01:00.986]  It's been quite an ordeal, but of course those guys really get there chasing the story down.
[00:01:01.307 --> 00:01:05.969]  And Alex Jones will be calling in sometime today to give us more updates on what he's finding out up there.
[00:01:06.269 --> 00:01:07.690]  A lot of news and information.
[00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.931]  Some of it you might have heard on Coast to Coast last night.
[00:01:09.991 --> 00:01:12.012]  Alex did a fantastic job with George Norrie.
[00:01:12.512 --> 00:01:15.393]  Should be calling in possibly even in the first hour today.
[00:01:15.413 --> 00:01:19.074]  We'll get some new fresh updates and reports from the Bilderberg Conference.
[00:01:19.434 --> 00:01:23.095]  Alex Jones and many other great patriots up there covering that event.
[00:01:23.115 --> 00:01:24.976]  We've got a full boat show for you today.
[00:01:25.456 --> 00:01:27.817]  Joining us in the second hour will be Rick Siegel.
[00:01:27.857 --> 00:01:28.397]  He is the
[00:01:29.393 --> 00:01:38.175]  Video publisher, editor, and filmmaker of 9-11 Eyewitness, a great new film that has really been making the rounds on the Internet.
[00:01:38.195 --> 00:01:40.675]  We'll be proud to have Rick Siegel joining us in the second hour.
[00:01:40.695 --> 00:01:43.336]  We're also going to run a lot of open phones today.
[00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:46.137]  Love to do that on Friday, Open Phone Fridays.
[00:01:46.217 --> 00:01:48.737]  It's a tradition, and we're going to continue that tradition.
[00:01:49.177 --> 00:01:50.178]  The number to call in is 800-259-9231.
[00:01:50.198 --> 00:01:53.078]  Now, are you folks as sick as I am of the Zakaoui story?
[00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:58.720]  Okay, we'll talk about it.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.920]  We'll try to keep breaking it down for you today.
[00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.822]  But this got so bad for me, and I'm sure a lot of you can sympathize with this.
[00:02:05.262 --> 00:02:09.584]  It got so bad for me that I couldn't even turn on the TV to watch the news yesterday.
[00:02:09.604 --> 00:02:24.329]  And I'm sure that that will continue for the next week as these neocons, their controllers, and the controlled established media continue to glad hand and pat each other on the back for a job well done in taking out Patsy No.
[00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.910]  2 of Al-Syayida, Abu Zakawi.
[00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.732]  But there are a number of breaking details.
[00:02:29.752 --> 00:02:31.252]  We'll be happy to go into that with you.
[00:02:31.292 --> 00:02:37.776]  But I have just, I've got to tell you, I have just never been so absolutely appalled by the news.
[00:02:37.976 --> 00:02:52.685]  Usually what I can do, and maybe a lot of you do this as well, I can watch hardball, or I can watch some of the cable news, or I could read a newspaper, and I'll glean some information, some valuable information spun and embedded in the warped news.
[00:02:53.067 --> 00:02:59.772]  Disinformation and psychological operations that comes our way and presents itself as quote-unquote news.
[00:02:59.892 --> 00:03:01.613]  But this has just been so bad.
[00:03:01.913 --> 00:03:04.095]  So many people jumping on this bandwagon.
[00:03:04.115 --> 00:03:06.877]  It is absolutely mind-boggling to me.
[00:03:06.957 --> 00:03:07.597]  What about you?
[00:03:07.797 --> 00:03:12.721]  To even see the so-called alternative news websites.
[00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:16.103]  Well, sometimes you must just go ahead and read Democrat into that.
[00:03:16.858 --> 00:03:25.905]  Even seeing them jump on board to this, despite all of the information that has been reported about Zakawi over the years, it's just absolutely astounding to me.
[00:03:26.445 --> 00:03:35.472]  When we say that GCN Radio Network is your first source of alternative news, we might need to change that to the alternative to the alternative.
[00:03:35.532 --> 00:03:37.294]  This is rebel underground news.
[00:03:37.814 --> 00:03:45.296]  Though I believe just about everything we say, well, I hope everything we say can be backed up 100% verified and documented.
[00:03:45.776 --> 00:03:46.797]  We do the best we can.
[00:03:46.817 --> 00:03:48.677]  Sometimes, you know, you fly by the seat of your pants.
[00:03:48.697 --> 00:03:54.999]  We're working very hard to get a lot of information out to you very quickly, and the facts constantly evolve.
[00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:58.360]  So as that happens, of course, we make a number of corrections.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.781]  What I do want to talk about and start the program off with today, and we'll spend a little time on this,
[00:04:03.396 --> 00:04:05.017]  There is a new breaking news story.
[00:04:05.097 --> 00:04:09.799]  It's just roughly about two, three days old at this point regarding Osama bin Laden.
[00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.181]  And this is the great thing about alternative websites.
[00:04:14.221 --> 00:04:17.663]  Well, this again might be the alternative to the alternative.
[00:04:18.243 --> 00:04:24.646]  And it has to do with Osama bin Laden and no hard evidence connecting bin Laden to 9-11.
[00:04:24.686 --> 00:04:29.368]  Well, a lot of us have suspected that all along, but there has been an ongoing investigation.
[00:04:29.972 --> 00:04:40.656]  The past weekend, a thought-provoking email circulated through the Internet news groups bringing attention to the FBI's most wanted list, the web page for Osama bin Laden.
[00:04:41.136 --> 00:04:46.978]  And in the wanted poster for bin Laden, there is no mention that he is wanted for 9-11.
[00:04:47.038 --> 00:04:47.598]  Why is that?
[00:04:47.818 --> 00:04:49.279]  We'll talk about that when we come back.
[00:04:49.299 --> 00:04:54.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show, GCN Radio Network, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:55.221 --> 00:04:55.601]  Stay tuned.
[00:04:55.621 --> 00:04:56.541]  We'll be right back after this.
[00:05:01.471 --> 00:05:09.759]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.262]  We're expecting around a thousand people in attendance.
[00:05:12.862 --> 00:05:21.711]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[00:05:22.231 --> 00:05:25.753]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda.
[00:05:26.213 --> 00:05:46.982]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Charmley, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[00:05:47.302 --> 00:05:50.984]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[00:05:51.504 --> 00:05:52.945]  Arm yourself with the truth.
[00:05:53.126 --> 00:06:00.972]  Secure your tickets today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:06:02.333 --> 00:06:05.315]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:06:05.696 --> 00:06:14.503]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:06:14.823 --> 00:06:19.507]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:06:19.967 --> 00:06:26.691]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:06:27.092 --> 00:06:38.879]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:43.480]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.021]  Globalists are concerned
[00:07:14.175 --> 00:07:14.695]  We're good to go.
[00:07:38.996 --> 00:07:41.017]  That's The Nationalist Times, PO Box 426, Allison Park, PA 15101.
[00:08:02.757 --> 00:08:08.762]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.383 --> 00:08:12.426]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.871 --> 00:08:23.255]  The one and only GCN Radio Network, the alternative to the alternative.
[00:08:23.315 --> 00:08:24.917]  I have to remember to say that.
[00:08:25.894 --> 00:08:27.716]  Alternative just isn't good enough anymore.
[00:08:28.156 --> 00:08:34.782]  Alternative has become mainstream, as I know a lot of you complain about, and I'm always watching out for that.
[00:08:34.802 --> 00:08:35.482]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:35.502 --> 00:08:37.104]  The lines are already jammed.
[00:08:37.444 --> 00:08:41.427]  We're going to continue to take calls here for the first hour and throughout the program today.
[00:08:41.447 --> 00:08:44.209]  I'll go right to your calls here in just about a minute, so hold on.
[00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:47.192]  We're also going to be playing a Keith Olbermann clip.
[00:08:48.287 --> 00:08:49.849]  Thrashing Ann Coulter.
[00:08:50.149 --> 00:08:51.070]  Genius clip.
[00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:51.830]  Very good stuff.
[00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:52.491]  Keith Oberman.
[00:08:52.871 --> 00:08:54.373]  Quite entertaining, I do have to say.
[00:08:54.413 --> 00:08:59.317]  We'll play that sometime, hopefully during the first hour here, or at least before the program is over.
[00:08:59.337 --> 00:09:08.124]  I was talking about something that has kind of slipped by a lot of us, that Osama Bin Laden on his FBI Most Wanted poster isn't wanted for 9-11.
[00:09:09.325 --> 00:09:10.366]  Why would that be?
[00:09:10.426 --> 00:09:14.428]  Well, the Muckraker Report decided to go ahead and follow up on this.
[00:09:14.448 --> 00:09:23.073]  They contacted FBI headquarters to learn why Bin Laden's Most Wanted poster did not indicate that Osama was also wanted in connection with 9-11.
[00:09:24.406 --> 00:09:32.810]  The Muckraker Report spoke with Rex Toome, there's a name for you, Chief of Investigative Publicity for the FBI.
[00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:48.537]  When asked why there was no mention of 9-11 on Bin Laden's Most Wanted webpage, Toome said, the reason why 9-11 is not mentioned on Osama Bin Laden's Most Wanted page is because the FBI has, quote, no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9-11.
[00:09:50.057 --> 00:09:56.561]  That's something you don't often hear into the newspapers or on your cable news shows or in the establishment media as a whole.
[00:09:57.262 --> 00:09:59.023]  But the FBI openly admits it.
[00:09:59.843 --> 00:10:08.589]  Surprised by the ease in which this FBI spokesman made such an astonishing statement, Muckraker asked, How is this possible?
[00:10:08.849 --> 00:10:09.590]  Good question.
[00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.391]  Toom continued, Did you know that?
[00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:12.452]  I did not know that, Jack.
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.723]  Well, we know he might have had something to do with it.
[00:10:22.783 --> 00:10:25.406]  We know he's never really admitted to having anything to do with it.
[00:10:25.646 --> 00:10:35.977]  We know that the evidence is rather faulty, unless you include the phony passport that floated down through the fiery World Trade Center towers, which later was redacted.
[00:10:36.557 --> 00:10:38.660]  They admitted that they never did find that passport.
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.784]  That was, again, on page A17 of some European newspaper.
[00:10:44.246 --> 00:10:46.990]  The Muckraker continued to ask, well, how does that work?
[00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:50.135]  And Toom continued, the FBI gathered evidence.
[00:10:50.615 --> 00:10:53.559]  Once evidence is gathered, it is turned over to the Department of Justice.
[00:10:53.579 --> 00:10:59.428]  The Department of Justice then decides whether it has enough evidence to present to a federal grand jury.
[00:11:00.143 --> 00:11:06.729]  In the case of the 1998 United States embassies being bombed, Bin Laden had been formally indicted and charged by a grand jury.
[00:11:07.169 --> 00:11:16.237]  He has not been formally indicted and charged in connection with 9-11 because the FBI has no hard evidence connected to Bin Laden in 9-11.
[00:11:16.517 --> 00:11:24.143]  The second time, Mr. Toome, Agent Toome, admits again, quote-unquote, no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9-11.
[00:11:26.383 --> 00:11:45.308]  Now, with no hard evidence, with no case by the Justice Department, not even included on the FBI wanted poster, should one ask why we are engaged in this global war on terror, why we have spent upteen billions of dollars looking at trillions of dollars hunting down bin Laden?
[00:11:45.348 --> 00:11:46.208]  Maybe this is why.
[00:11:46.914 --> 00:11:49.896]  George W. Bush isn't as concerned to find bin Laden as we might think.
[00:11:49.916 --> 00:11:54.299]  Of course, again, we could slip right in this little spot right here.
[00:11:54.639 --> 00:12:01.363]  Bin Laden somewhere on ice, ready to be rolled out exactly when the robed Cheney-Bush team might just need them.
[00:12:01.383 --> 00:12:02.864]  The story continues.
[00:12:02.904 --> 00:12:09.268]  It shouldn't take too long before the full meaning of these FBI statements start to prick your brain and raise your blood pressure.
[00:12:10.163 --> 00:12:18.905]  If you think the way Muckraker is thinking here, in order, the quick order, you will be wrestling with a barrage of a very powerful question that must be answered.
[00:12:18.925 --> 00:12:20.105]  First and foremost, that the U.S.
[00:12:20.125 --> 00:12:23.426]  government does not have enough hard evidence connecting bin Laden to 9-11.
[00:12:23.646 --> 00:12:28.968]  How is it possible that it had enough evidence to invade Afghanistan and smoke him out of his cave?
[00:12:29.768 --> 00:12:34.149]  The federal government claims to have invaded Afghanistan to root out bin Laden and the Taliban.
[00:12:34.758 --> 00:12:42.822]  Remember now, the Taliban being embraced by Yale University, by the UAE, one of our business partners, etc., etc.
[00:12:43.642 --> 00:12:54.627]  Through the talking heads in the mainstream media, the Bush administration told the American people that Osama bin Laden was public enemy number one and responsible for the deaths of nearly 3,000 people on September 11th.
[00:12:55.007 --> 00:12:58.829]  Nearly five years later, the FBI, that so-called...
[00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:06.333]  It's supposed to be on board with this, as again, it has no hard evidence connecting bin Laden to 9-11.
[00:13:06.373 --> 00:13:12.156]  Next, of course, is the bin Laden confession, quote-unquote confession video that was released by the U.S.
[00:13:12.176 --> 00:13:13.496]  government on December 13th, 2001.
[00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:18.731]  Most Americans remember this video.
[00:13:18.751 --> 00:13:26.714]  It was the video showing the fat bin Laden with a few of his comrades recounting with delight the September 11th terrorist attacks against the United States.
[00:13:27.234 --> 00:13:39.800]  The Department of Defense issued a press release accompanying this video in which Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld said there was no doubt of bin Laden's responsibility in the September 11th attacks before the tape was discovered.
[00:13:40.771 --> 00:13:51.515]  What Rumsfeld implied by his statement was that Bin Laden was the known mastermind behind 9-11 even before the confession video, which again has been proven fake over and over again.
[00:13:51.555 --> 00:14:03.739]  The BBC News article reporting the 9-11 confession video released, President Bush is said to have been hesitant to release the tape because he knew it would be a vivid reminder to many people of their loss and that they might be discovered.
[00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:08.401]  But he also knew it would be a devastating declaration of Bin Laden's guilt
[00:14:09.147 --> 00:14:11.549]  We're going to get them, said President Bush, dead or alive.
[00:14:11.569 --> 00:14:13.370]  It doesn't matter to me, whatever happened to that.
[00:14:15.171 --> 00:14:19.554]  We can go on and on and on with this, but I think that's a very interesting revelation.
[00:14:19.594 --> 00:14:21.235]  I'm glad people are out investigating this.
[00:14:21.295 --> 00:14:25.338]  I'm glad people are hammering the FBI to get answers to these questions.
[00:14:25.638 --> 00:14:36.145]  The entire war on Al-Qaeda, the entire war on bin Laden, seems to be being waged under phony pretexts, according to the FBI.
[00:14:37.338 --> 00:14:38.538]  You're welcome to come on in that.
[00:14:38.598 --> 00:14:42.720]  We've got a lot of news to report, and we're going to take a lot of your calls today, a lot of guests coming up.
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:47.241]  We had originally scheduled one of the 9-11 widows.
[00:14:47.281 --> 00:14:50.362]  It appears that they will not be joining us on the program today.
[00:14:50.562 --> 00:14:59.085]  They strictly said on the Ann Coulter story they do not want to feed into this publicity stunt anymore, and we have to, again, honor that.
[00:14:59.145 --> 00:15:03.526]  So, unfortunately, they will not be joining us today, although, again, we do have Rick Siegel, 9-11 eyewitness.
[00:15:03.546 --> 00:15:05.787]  9-11 eyewitness, right, Kevin?
[00:15:07.645 --> 00:15:08.366]  Good afternoon, Jack.
[00:15:08.386 --> 00:15:11.168]  First of all, I want to give compliments to GCN, because the info that they give out is valuable.
[00:15:32.682 --> 00:15:33.062]  No, I don't.
[00:15:33.082 --> 00:15:36.485]  I think the British intelligence is maybe a little better, and...
[00:16:00.715 --> 00:16:05.079]  Certainly some people could make the case that the Mossad is maybe one of the best at assassination.
[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:06.601]  They've had a lot of practice.
[00:16:06.981 --> 00:16:08.943]  Okay, well, I'll go ahead and skip over that point.
[00:16:09.183 --> 00:16:15.069]  Well, the reason why I called, Jack, is because I wanted to talk about September 11th, or what I call the business of complicit terror.
[00:16:15.629 --> 00:16:20.194]  And I, you know, I might be in the dark about the subject, and maybe you can bring, like, you know, Plato's Allegory.
[00:16:20.214 --> 00:16:22.316]  You can bring me out of the dark and bring me to the light.
[00:16:23.277 --> 00:16:24.017]  I'll do my best.
[00:16:24.418 --> 00:16:24.618]  Okay?
[00:16:25.106 --> 00:16:25.706]  I'll do my best.
[00:16:26.286 --> 00:16:26.667]  Yeah.
[00:16:26.727 --> 00:16:29.588]  Well, September 11th is what I call the business of complicit terror.
[00:16:30.048 --> 00:16:36.990]  The business side of it would be CDC Stein, Army Silver Stein, and, well, Leighton are patent defects.
[00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:39.911]  Those bills are coming down sooner or later because of business reasons.
[00:16:40.484 --> 00:16:41.124]  Complicit?
[00:16:41.204 --> 00:16:44.385]  Well, that would be Plutonton, I mean, New Egypt, I mean, Washington.
[00:16:44.885 --> 00:16:51.887]  Well, finally, let's get on to the terror, or what I see as, or what you all see as Al-Syayda, and I see as Al-Qaeda.
[00:16:51.907 --> 00:17:04.870]  Now, I could take up your whole show debating with logic and deductive analysis, Mr. Blood, but I'll start by using Ruby Ridge, Waco, Oklahoma City, and the First World Trade Center to establish my argument.
[00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:07.071]  But I have a couple quick points, and then I'll get off the air.
[00:17:07.111 --> 00:17:07.511]  Sure, go ahead.
[00:17:08.031 --> 00:17:11.112]  Point one, are you familiar with sacred British geometry?
[00:17:11.832 --> 00:17:14.913]  Point two, there were some terrorists that were involved in the 9-11 plot.
[00:17:14.953 --> 00:17:15.973]  Excuse me, 9-11.
[00:17:16.013 --> 00:17:19.654]  Well, let's take these one point at a time, if we could, and I'll make my answers pretty quick.
[00:17:19.854 --> 00:17:24.815]  Yes, I am very familiar with sacred geometry, going back even to Sumer and Egypt.
[00:17:25.035 --> 00:17:25.875]  That would be a yes.
[00:17:25.915 --> 00:17:26.775]  Go ahead.
[00:17:27.175 --> 00:17:27.415]  Okay.
[00:17:27.435 --> 00:17:35.457]  Then point number two, there were terrorists involved, well, there were two terrorists involved in the 9-11 plot that were arrested in Dallas, that were on their way to San Antonio.
[00:17:36.007 --> 00:17:36.987]  We're good to go.
[00:17:55.192 --> 00:17:57.754]  Isn't that the truth?
[00:17:57.894 --> 00:18:01.657]  Yeah, and if you look at the ticker on the bottom, then that's where all the real info is at.
[00:18:01.837 --> 00:18:02.857]  Yeah, I've noticed that, too.
[00:18:02.917 --> 00:18:08.241]  I've driven myself crazy trying to keep up with what's on TV and read the ticker at the same time.
[00:18:08.541 --> 00:18:09.802]  You know, and you're right, Moses.
[00:18:09.862 --> 00:18:19.769]  A lot of the news that was reported and that we know about 9-11, like in any event, was reported immediately as the event was happening before the compartmentalized media could be reeled in.
[00:18:25.157 --> 00:18:40.164]  Um, if Bin Laden is who you say he is as a scene site for assassination, I mean, CIA Patsy, and Moussaoui is who you say he is, then why would, uh, the day after Moussaoui was sentenced in his trial, why would Bin Laden make a tape calling, uh, Moussaoui...
[00:18:40.524 --> 00:18:56.047]  That wasn't Bin Laden, and according to all the experts, Bin Laden has been dead at least for the last year or two, and I believe he's been dead since 2001, according to Pervez Musharraf, Ahmed Karzai, and a number of key players in that particular region.
[00:18:56.367 --> 00:19:00.588]  As you know, he's on kidney dialysis machines, and he's on the run living in the mountains somewhere.
[00:19:03.209 --> 00:19:03.409]  Sure.
[00:19:04.129 --> 00:19:07.650]  That's why it's contradictory, and it's meant to be contradictory, and it's meant to confuse you.
[00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:10.111]  Well, that's what I see inside for assassination.
[00:19:10.172 --> 00:19:12.533]  Confused, conspiracy scenes outside for assassination.
[00:19:12.553 --> 00:19:14.634]  And when we show up, we're kind of caught in the middle.
[00:19:15.495 --> 00:19:16.716]  But I hear you on that point.
[00:19:17.256 --> 00:19:20.878]  And lastly, I had to take on that one more.
[00:19:21.299 --> 00:19:27.903]  If Al-Qaeda, who as you say they are, then why would they mail anthrax to their own boys in Washington and the media?
[00:19:28.496 --> 00:19:31.638]  To me, that would be like... Yeah, I understand the question.
[00:19:31.758 --> 00:19:41.203]  As you know, Al-Qaeda wouldn't have the opportunity to have the weaponized anthrax that was sent to all of the enemies of the Bush administration just after 9-11.
[00:19:41.564 --> 00:19:56.032]  Of course, we always have to note when we talk about that that the Bush administration not only had, as you mentioned earlier, the business end of this, a financial investment with the Carlyle Group into BioPort, but they were on Cipro, the antidote for anthrax, even before the anthrax attacks happened.
[00:19:56.681 --> 00:19:57.783]  Hey, good call, Moses.
[00:19:57.983 --> 00:19:58.864]  Major improvement.
[00:19:58.884 --> 00:19:59.585]  Keep up the good work.
[00:19:59.605 --> 00:20:00.326]  We'll be right back, folks.
[00:20:01.835 --> 00:20:03.456]  I used to be ashamed of my toenails.
[00:20:03.576 --> 00:20:07.839]  I thought I was destined to wear tennis shoes through the heat of the summer and hide my toes at the beach.
[00:20:08.239 --> 00:20:10.901]  And then my podiatrist told me about Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:20:11.061 --> 00:20:15.684]  It tackles unsightly nails by clearing out the cause of the problem, yellowing keratin debris buildup.
[00:20:15.844 --> 00:20:20.668]  With regular use, Non-X Gel breaks down and removes the debris so toenails look clear.
[00:20:20.848 --> 00:20:25.571]  This summer I'm wearing open-toed sandals again thanks to a topical natural gel called Non-X.
[00:20:25.791 --> 00:20:28.473]  If your toenails are embarrassing, I recommend Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:20:28.693 --> 00:20:31.575]  It's at your pharmacy or mass retailer in the foot care section.
[00:20:32.876 --> 00:20:33.476]  We're good to go.
[00:20:33.496 --> 00:20:34.077]  We're good to go.
[00:21:07.296 --> 00:21:09.397]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[00:21:09.857 --> 00:21:10.558]  One and the same.
[00:21:11.298 --> 00:21:15.301]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:21:15.742 --> 00:21:17.363]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:21:17.403 --> 00:21:18.444]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:21:18.524 --> 00:21:20.465]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:21:31.744 --> 00:21:32.605]  Here is reality.
[00:21:32.985 --> 00:21:36.568]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:21:37.048 --> 00:21:40.711]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:21:41.271 --> 00:21:45.014]  Gold, in the same time frame, increased 35% in value.
[00:21:45.454 --> 00:21:49.177]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.
[00:21:49.537 --> 00:21:51.018]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:51.058 --> 00:21:51.298]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:02.364 --> 00:22:11.432]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[00:22:11.672 --> 00:22:22.922]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:22:23.242 --> 00:22:28.967]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury and aluminum are no problem.
[00:22:29.207 --> 00:22:29.867]  We're good to go.
[00:22:53.433 --> 00:22:53.793]  803-4438.
[00:22:53.833 --> 00:22:57.115]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:22:57.335 --> 00:22:59.516]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:23:01.137 --> 00:23:05.559]  Local folklore has recognized its amazing medicinal properties for thousands of years.
[00:23:05.719 --> 00:23:11.402]  But no one knew just how to preserve the nutritional benefits and market the total fruit commercially until Zango, that is.
[00:23:11.762 --> 00:23:16.685]  Zango is made from mangosteen, a fruit that grows in the subtropical climates of Southeast Asia.
[00:23:16.925 --> 00:23:21.427]  It contains xanthones, the highest concentration of antioxidants found in nature.
[00:23:21.707 --> 00:23:28.011]  Modern science is only just beginning to unlock the many secrets of Xanthos and their far-reaching potential to improve our health.
[00:23:28.311 --> 00:23:29.832]  Zango is revolutionary.
[00:23:30.052 --> 00:23:40.057]  Not only has Zango taken the world by storm as an extremely potent functional health beverage, but Zango has become the most exciting and fastest growing home-based business opportunity ever.
[00:23:40.358 --> 00:23:42.519]  Life is short, and timing is everything.
[00:23:42.839 --> 00:23:44.461]  Unleash the power of Zango today.

[00:23:46.043 --> 00:23:46.743]  That's 888-203-6633.

[00:23:48.826 --> 00:23:50.368]  That's M-A-N-G-O-S-T-E-E-N market.com.
[00:24:04.091 --> 00:24:10.142]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:10.743 --> 00:24:13.708]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:18.488 --> 00:24:21.210]  Deep behind enemy lines, that is an understatement.
[00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:24.152]  Welcome, fellow enemies of the state.
[00:24:24.452 --> 00:24:26.013]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:26.073 --> 00:24:27.714]  I'm Jack Blood, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:24:27.934 --> 00:24:32.817]  Of course, my show follows Alex's show every day on this very network, 2 to 4 p.m.
[00:24:33.337 --> 00:24:34.418]  on this very network.
[00:24:34.498 --> 00:24:36.680]  Your alternative to the alternative news.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:40.802]  It's harder to say, but it is much more effective and much more accurate.
[00:24:41.162 --> 00:24:42.623]  My website is jackblood.com.
[00:24:42.783 --> 00:24:45.025]  I've got daily news headlines over there, including...
[00:24:45.485 --> 00:24:51.614]  This story of this FBI investigation where the FBI again says no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9-11.
[00:24:51.655 --> 00:24:53.257]  I'd like to get your comments on that.
[00:24:53.277 --> 00:24:53.377]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:53.597 --> 00:24:54.619]  Before we go right back to your calls...
[00:24:57.805 --> 00:24:59.907]  This is hot off the presses, Yahoo News.
[00:24:59.967 --> 00:25:01.288]  Bush says U.S.
[00:25:01.328 --> 00:25:05.811]  troops out only after, quote-unquote, victory in Iraq.
[00:25:06.011 --> 00:25:07.632]  When is victory going to come?
[00:25:08.073 --> 00:25:09.914]  If victory ever comes, we're going to get out.
[00:25:09.954 --> 00:25:17.400]  Now, of course, in the world of Orwellian doublespeak and doublethink, victory means absolute total failure and total chaos.
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:22.063]  So once total chaos and total failure has been achieved, then the U.S.
[00:25:22.103 --> 00:25:23.004]  troops might get out.
[00:25:23.044 --> 00:25:26.947]  But, of course, as we have spoken to a number of high-level experts on this,
[00:25:27.487 --> 00:25:27.908]  We're good to go.
[00:25:27.928 --> 00:25:28.168]  I think?
[00:25:55.570 --> 00:26:00.675]  If you thought we were getting out, I don't know, I doubt anyone in this audience ever thought we were getting out there.
[00:26:00.715 --> 00:26:06.842]  Joseph Stiglitz, former chief economist of the World Bank, put the estimate of the cost of Iraq at $2 trillion.
[00:26:07.242 --> 00:26:07.682]  Is it worth it?
[00:26:07.702 --> 00:26:09.744]  But I wonder what the Iraqi people think.
[00:26:10.165 --> 00:26:14.169]  We replaced Saddam Hussein because he killed his own people.
[00:26:15.288 --> 00:26:16.409]  Murdered his own people.
[00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:21.352]  The evidence of that, I'm sure it's there in some capacity, but it's very shaky.
[00:26:21.632 --> 00:26:32.620]  Most of the claims that have been made by the coalition against Saddam Hussein, and I am no Saddam Hussein apologist, because he was certainly one of their men, a secret society member from the Safari Club, of course.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.502]  Former hitman put into power as a dictator in Iraq.
[00:26:36.662 --> 00:26:41.626]  So I'm not defending Saddam Hussein, but it just seems very obvious to me, if you're an Iraqi...
[00:26:43.173 --> 00:26:47.798]  Maybe you're better off if you're a Shiite, if you're a Sunni.
[00:26:48.499 --> 00:26:54.465]  You're certainly not better off if you are the average blue-collar or poverty-stricken Iraqi.
[00:26:54.505 --> 00:26:58.930]  And you'll notice a lot of death continues, a lot more palaces are continuing to be built.
[00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:01.413]  But yeah, here's Bush's latest statement on Iraq.
[00:27:02.213 --> 00:27:04.755]  I'm sure this is going to really help the polls, isn't it folks?
[00:27:04.795 --> 00:27:08.919]  The approval rating for this war roughly at around 35% now.
[00:27:09.219 --> 00:27:11.361]  I'm sure this is really going to boost his approval ratings.
[00:27:11.381 --> 00:27:14.965]  A lot more news to cover on the show, but let's go right back to your calls while we have the time.
[00:27:14.985 --> 00:27:15.285]  800-259-9231.
[00:27:15.345 --> 00:27:17.167]  There's starting to be a new slogan.
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:21.820]  Hey, how are you doing?
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:22.080]  Very good.
[00:27:50.903 --> 00:28:04.169]  Yeah, it's funny you brought up about the FBI, because I went in and did a fire extinguisher inspection on the FBI building down in Austin about four months ago, and the Echelon building up on 183, those big black ones, those are the FBI buildings.
[00:28:04.949 --> 00:28:06.289]  The IRS is in one as well.
[00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:13.032]  But as I was in there doing it, I noticed the poster of Bin Laden as well, and that's the guy at the front.
[00:28:13.372 --> 00:28:14.913]  Why isn't 9-11 on there?
[00:28:14.933 --> 00:28:16.454]  Why isn't he wanted for that?
[00:28:16.574 --> 00:28:16.934]  Good for you.
[00:28:16.954 --> 00:28:17.394]  What did he say?
[00:28:18.059 --> 00:28:24.861]  The best answer he could come up with, he was a little uncomfortable, was, well, we all know that he was responsible for that, you know.
[00:28:25.562 --> 00:28:27.242]  And it was just kind of humorous.
[00:28:27.262 --> 00:28:31.124]  Blatant obfuscation is a word I like to use a lot on my programs.
[00:28:31.184 --> 00:28:37.546]  But, I mean, here you have the spokesperson for the FBI fully admitting there's no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9-11.
[00:28:37.886 --> 00:28:41.347]  Maybe you should tell that guy that the next time you go there and do your job.
[00:28:42.867 --> 00:28:47.329]  Well, I got escorted around to every room in there, even all the highest security ones,
[00:28:47.842 --> 00:28:47.982]  Yep.
[00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:16.672]  They actually on all the calendars have a time on there as well of the day.
[00:29:17.153 --> 00:29:25.617]  And if you added the numerology of the month, day, and year is a 9, and the numerology of the time is an 11, so that would make that 9-11.
[00:29:26.218 --> 00:29:35.943]  You know, if you're still hanging around and listening when my program comes on in just about three hours here, we're going to have Tex Mars on, and he is an expert in this, and I would bring this up to him.
[00:29:35.963 --> 00:29:39.885]  I can comment on it, but why, when we've got an expert like Tex Mars?
[00:29:39.905 --> 00:29:40.686]  We'll be right back, folks.
[00:29:40.706 --> 00:29:41.046]  Stay tuned.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:52.883]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.384 --> 00:29:54.968]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.988 --> 00:29:58.598]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.917 --> 00:30:03.737]  Come on, Bill.
[00:30:03.958 --> 00:30:09.142]  Two weeks ago you were riding the bicycle, and today you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[00:30:09.483 --> 00:30:10.964]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[00:30:11.064 --> 00:30:13.046]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[00:30:13.326 --> 00:30:18.851]  What I did do is visit the website www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[00:30:19.132 --> 00:30:25.398]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[00:30:25.718 --> 00:30:27.920]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:31.642]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week.
[00:30:31.863 --> 00:30:32.363]  Whoa.
[00:30:32.663 --> 00:30:33.884]  What was that website again?
[00:30:33.944 --> 00:30:37.446]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:30:37.746 --> 00:30:38.847]  Now write this down, John.
[00:30:38.987 --> 00:30:43.290]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:44.031]  Thanks, Bill.
[00:30:44.291 --> 00:30:45.512]  I'm going there right now.
[00:30:45.912 --> 00:30:46.592]  Check, please.
[00:30:48.354 --> 00:30:49.794]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[00:30:50.295 --> 00:30:50.875]  Sure, John.
[00:30:51.095 --> 00:30:55.478]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:30:55.758 --> 00:30:57.460]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:57.880]  Deal.
[00:30:59.224 --> 00:31:01.185]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[00:31:01.265 --> 00:31:01.925]  Hello, folks.
[00:31:02.065 --> 00:31:11.990]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:16.872]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:16.952 --> 00:31:28.278]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:28.878 --> 00:31:35.726]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:31:36.126 --> 00:31:38.248]  Your purified water is now ready.
[00:31:38.749 --> 00:31:43.714]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[00:31:44.014 --> 00:31:54.589]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:31:54.809 --> 00:31:55.630]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:32:00.012 --> 00:32:02.573]  What's better than a tiny tiger in your tank?
[00:32:02.893 --> 00:32:04.454]  A tornado under your hood!
[00:32:04.614 --> 00:32:10.376]  A tornado is an easy-to-install, maintenance-free air twister designed to increase gas mileage.
[00:32:10.676 --> 00:32:17.758]  I personally commissioned independent tests to verify results in six vehicles, and all of them gained MPG with Tornado.
[00:32:17.898 --> 00:32:22.700]  With today's gas prices, it makes sense to cage the gas-saving power of a tornado.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:28.362]  Visit TornadoAir.com or pick up your tornado at Checker, Shucks, and Cragen today.
[00:32:30.374 --> 00:32:34.115]  In today's world of discord and disappointment, one thing's for sure.
[00:32:34.355 --> 00:32:39.177]  Car cover owners are so satisfied, they buy their car covers all over again.
[00:32:39.457 --> 00:32:40.918]  Think car covers are a hassle?
[00:32:41.198 --> 00:32:41.398]  No.
[00:32:41.738 --> 00:32:45.499]  Research shows owners find covers easy to put on and take off.
[00:32:45.899 --> 00:32:47.260]  Are all covers the same?
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:47.740]  No.
[00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:51.701]  The standard in car cover fabric is Block-It by Kimberly Clark.
[00:32:52.102 --> 00:32:54.222]  Don't let sun and dust damage your car.
[00:32:54.502 --> 00:32:57.043]  Kimberly Clark's Block-It fabric's got you covered.
[00:32:57.303 --> 00:32:59.084]  That's Block-It by Kimberly Clark.
[00:33:02.592 --> 00:33:05.334]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:05.354 --> 00:33:09.256]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:10.096 --> 00:33:15.920]  Suffice to say...
[00:33:29.679 --> 00:33:31.221]  The global super elite.
[00:33:31.341 --> 00:33:41.355]  I call them the Neo-Pharaohs and their matrix moles, their stooges, love numerology, love occult, love sacred geometry.
[00:33:41.675 --> 00:33:44.198]  This is why this topic often comes up on the program.
[00:33:45.046 --> 00:33:46.327]  I don't put a lot of credence in it.
[00:33:46.367 --> 00:33:47.487]  I don't use it myself.
[00:33:47.567 --> 00:33:54.551]  But I do pay attention to it because sometimes it could carry a warning or even a corporate logo.
[00:33:54.911 --> 00:33:57.493]  Again, Tex Mars joining me on Deadline Live today.
[00:33:57.533 --> 00:33:59.714]  His book Codex Magica is brilliant.
[00:34:00.094 --> 00:34:03.736]  Secret signs, mysterious symbols, and hidden codes of the Illuminati.
[00:34:03.996 --> 00:34:07.078]  And you can get that right here at Infowars.com.
[00:34:08.301 --> 00:34:15.105]  A great, great book, and we're actually going to be giving a few of those away, I believe, today to some of our club members and even just you regular listeners.
[00:34:15.505 --> 00:34:19.287]  Not that you're any better or worse, but we love our club members because they support us.
[00:34:19.547 --> 00:34:20.868]  Let's just go right back to the phones.
[00:34:20.888 --> 00:34:23.269]  We've got a great Obermann clip to play here.
[00:34:23.289 --> 00:34:27.231]  We're waiting for an update from Alex Jones from the Bilderberg Conference in Ottawa, Canada.
[00:34:27.532 --> 00:34:33.455]  And then we have Rick Siegel joining us, talking about his film, 9-11 Eyewitness, The Hoboken.
[00:34:33.875 --> 00:34:37.577]  ...film, as it is often referred to, and that should be very interesting indeed.
[00:34:37.897 --> 00:34:39.738]  Let's just go right back to the phones.
[00:34:39.758 --> 00:34:39.958]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:43.220]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:44.961]  I'm Jack Blood, filling in for Alex today.
[00:34:45.041 --> 00:34:46.802]  Alex will be back on Monday.
[00:34:46.862 --> 00:34:50.143]  I know you all can't wait to hear Alex Jones back in the chair.
[00:34:50.163 --> 00:34:51.364]  But I'm doing the best I can.
[00:34:51.404 --> 00:34:52.765]  Who can fill Alex's shoes?
[00:34:53.125 --> 00:34:54.485]  Many people have tried.
[00:34:54.806 --> 00:34:56.186]  Many people have failed.
[00:34:56.246 --> 00:34:58.567]  I just do the very best I can, and that's all I can do.
[00:34:58.868 --> 00:35:00.929]  Jason in Maryland, thank you for calling in.
[00:35:01.049 --> 00:35:01.569]  You're on the air.
[00:35:02.358 --> 00:35:02.919]  Hi, Jack.
[00:35:03.339 --> 00:35:06.281]  Did I just hear you say that you're giving away the book Codex Magica?
[00:35:06.702 --> 00:35:12.246]  If you are a club member of my club, I give away a lot of books and videos to my club members.
[00:35:12.286 --> 00:35:17.190]  But today, we'll have trivia questions and callers on my program to win this book.
[00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:18.271]  Yes, we have a couple of copies.
[00:35:18.291 --> 00:35:19.092]  Thanks to Tex Mars.
[00:35:19.452 --> 00:35:20.593]  Great.
[00:35:20.653 --> 00:35:24.536]  But if you can't win one, I want people to call Infowars.com and get one.
[00:35:24.596 --> 00:35:26.437]  It's one of the most brilliant books I've ever read.
[00:35:26.457 --> 00:35:28.839]  It is so fascinating, full of so many pictures.
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.761]  I thought I knew a lot, okay?
[00:35:32.281 --> 00:35:33.542]  I didn't know as much as this.
[00:35:33.602 --> 00:35:36.904]  I learned so much reading this book and very, very interesting stuff.
[00:35:36.944 --> 00:35:38.125]  But that answers that question.
[00:35:38.565 --> 00:35:40.547]  Text has always got great information.
[00:35:41.407 --> 00:35:45.010]  My question is, I heard or read...
[00:35:45.686 --> 00:36:12.805]  I can't recall back in the 40s that the government had done some psyops with subliminal messages in as much as they in movie theaters across the country had begun a program of flashing the word popcorn and different words and increasing the sales thereof astronomically and realizing that the...
[00:36:15.563 --> 00:36:17.905]  The technology has increased exponentially.
[00:36:18.746 --> 00:36:23.090]  I suppose that the computer doubles its ability every 18 months from what I've heard.
[00:36:24.591 --> 00:36:26.933]  Do you know anything about what I was just talking about?
[00:36:26.973 --> 00:36:27.934]  Sure, absolutely.
[00:36:27.974 --> 00:36:35.681]  Of course, there was a big scandal back in the 80s all about this when Madison Avenue was caught using what they call embeds.
[00:36:35.741 --> 00:36:42.286]  If you've ever seen the movie They Live with Roddy Roddy Piper, it's really kind of a great...
[00:36:43.901 --> 00:36:53.307]  Explanation of this, you get the special sunglasses and you can see that all the billboards that carry all the corporate logos really just say, submit, obey, okay?
[00:36:53.708 --> 00:36:58.771]  But they're actually called embeds, which kind of refers to embedded reporters in Iraq.
[00:36:58.811 --> 00:37:01.473]  I mean, there's some kind of a connection there I think that you can make.
[00:37:01.553 --> 00:37:06.396]  But they were supposed to be eradicated back in the 80s when it was originally discovered.
[00:37:06.656 --> 00:37:10.659]  And what happened was, I can't remember the name of the person that brought this to light, but
[00:37:10.959 --> 00:37:11.420]  We're good to go.
[00:37:26.778 --> 00:37:27.458]  We're good to go.
[00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:54.455]  I have, in fact, because I have an 11-year-old son, watched cartoons at length when I was just coming to understand, you know, my eyes were being opened by Alex and his ilk, and
[00:38:17.233 --> 00:38:21.128]  So I started watching what my son was watching and was amazed that...
[00:38:22.865 --> 00:38:28.048]  Other than subliminally, I mean, the occult symbology in the cartoons is replete.
[00:38:28.148 --> 00:38:29.089]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:38:29.389 --> 00:38:31.130]  Why do you think they call it programming?
[00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:35.172]  Now we have 500 channels of programming or more.
[00:38:35.572 --> 00:38:38.814]  We're very careful what we let our child watch in our family.
[00:38:39.054 --> 00:38:45.538]  Very little TV, a lot of reading, and he's almost three years old, and he is way ahead of the curve.
[00:38:45.658 --> 00:38:47.559]  But be very careful about that, folks.
[00:38:47.799 --> 00:38:48.339]  Very careful.
[00:38:48.559 --> 00:38:49.320]  Anything else, Jason?
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.101]  Yeah, two final questions.
[00:38:52.117 --> 00:38:56.040]  One, relating to your last caller, and one, to what I just asked.
[00:38:56.060 --> 00:39:02.424]  Do you know of a website where I could study about this subliminal programming?
[00:39:06.232 --> 00:39:08.795]  I'm not sure if he was referring to that.
[00:39:08.815 --> 00:39:09.957]  That could be.
[00:39:09.997 --> 00:39:11.198]  You see, there's a lot of key dates.
[00:39:11.298 --> 00:39:14.822]  And again, Tex will go over that with us in a few hours on Deadline Live.
[00:39:23.112 --> 00:39:23.553]  We're good to go.
[00:39:23.573 --> 00:39:23.873]  I think?
[00:39:38.431 --> 00:39:39.052]  We're good to go.
[00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:05.912]  I'd have to say personally, this isn't an Alex Jones endorsement, but I would personally go to David Icke for that information.
[00:40:05.972 --> 00:40:07.272]  I went to a conference that he did.
[00:40:07.292 --> 00:40:17.675]  He had a major PowerPoint presentation on this, and it is absolutely astounding, and I would recommend probably Tales from the Time Loop for one of the best resources on that subject.
[00:40:18.135 --> 00:40:21.095]  David Icke's website is just davidecke.com?
[00:40:21.115 --> 00:40:21.515]  That's it.
[00:40:22.076 --> 00:40:22.516]  Thanks a lot.
[00:40:22.536 --> 00:40:23.496]  Thanks for the call, Jason.
[00:40:23.516 --> 00:40:24.096]  I appreciate it.
[00:40:24.116 --> 00:40:25.336]  Let's go to Mike in Texas.
[00:40:25.396 --> 00:40:26.297]  Mike, thank you for holding.
[00:40:26.317 --> 00:40:27.317]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:40:28.018 --> 00:40:28.458]  Hey, Jack.
[00:40:28.478 --> 00:40:29.019]  How are you, buddy?
[00:40:29.079 --> 00:40:29.479]  Very good.
[00:40:29.919 --> 00:40:31.540]  Thanks for not saying hi, Jack, by the way.
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:32.180]  Appreciate that.
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:34.101]  Oh, no.
[00:40:34.441 --> 00:40:38.223]  Hey, you sound almost as classy as that felon, Alex Jones.
[00:40:39.644 --> 00:40:40.384]  That's a joke.
[00:40:40.784 --> 00:40:43.286]  Anyway, you know... We're both thought criminals and enemies of the state.
[00:40:43.306 --> 00:40:43.866]  That's true.
[00:40:43.926 --> 00:40:44.366]  You know what?
[00:40:44.766 --> 00:40:47.888]  What's amazing to me is I was talking to Buddy today, and...
[00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:57.795]  He actually had sued then-Governor Bush down here in Texas, and he actually won, and he actually warned a lot of people what would happen if we got him into office, and you know what?
[00:40:57.835 --> 00:40:59.156]  He's been 100% true.
[00:40:59.757 --> 00:41:04.579]  But he brought up an interesting point to me today, and God dang it, you know what?
[00:41:04.639 --> 00:41:05.960]  People need to wake up up there.
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:09.602]  If Ann Coulter is slapping her lips off, then you know what?
[00:41:10.042 --> 00:41:14.245]  The Democrats need to get real aggressive and
[00:41:14.736 --> 00:41:20.321]  Correlate her with George Bush and say, you know, George Bush... Why don't they do that?
[00:41:20.761 --> 00:41:32.050]  I don't understand because what she did was she attacked people who died and I basically was going to throw something to the TV, but I want all these Christians that put George Bush into office...
[00:41:32.501 --> 00:41:38.364]  I want the Democrats to get aggressive, and if you've got to get rid of Howard... And she accuses... Let me just interrupt you.
[00:41:38.384 --> 00:41:39.265]  I'm sorry to do that.
[00:41:39.345 --> 00:41:43.167]  It's not usually my style, but I want to cut in before we lose our train of thought here.
[00:41:43.527 --> 00:41:48.410]  You know, I mean, here we have... We have potentially Christine Bratweiser joining us today, all right?
[00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:55.734]  Here's the perfect chance they're accused of being Democrats, of backing John Kerry, and maybe that's an accusation that would be hard to avoid for them.
[00:41:55.934 --> 00:41:59.876]  But here is a chance for the Democratic Party to really latch on to something that's going to be...
[00:42:00.376 --> 00:42:04.640]  It bothers me because I have my girlfriend who used to be, and you're going to love this one,
[00:42:22.788 --> 00:42:27.729]  My girlfriend used to be a Sean Hannity lover, and that was in 2000.
[00:42:27.849 --> 00:42:33.750]  And I continually, because of guys like you and Alex Jones, we've had a number of conversations.
[00:42:34.151 --> 00:42:35.631]  And again, this really bothers me.
[00:42:35.691 --> 00:42:43.913]  Why is not somebody out there going, hey, you know what, let's run a commercial now where, you know what, all of a sudden Ann Coulter is the spokesman for George Bush.
[00:42:44.033 --> 00:42:47.033]  And say, you know, I mean, let's get George Bush to say bullshit.
[00:42:47.053 --> 00:42:48.394]  Well, this is what the Republicans do.
[00:42:48.474 --> 00:42:49.214]  I mean, whenever...
[00:42:50.468 --> 00:42:55.814]  Howard Zinn opens up his mouth, or Noam Chomsky, or any of these far-left people.
[00:42:55.894 --> 00:43:00.239]  They instantly lump them in with any Democrat, centrist, or otherwise.
[00:43:00.259 --> 00:43:06.205]  This has been a tactic of theirs now for the last eight years, or even going back to the contract with America.
[00:43:06.765 --> 00:43:08.626]  And it's worked flawlessly for them.
[00:43:08.846 --> 00:43:12.467]  So again, we have to ask ourselves a question, trying to use logic and common sense.
[00:43:12.707 --> 00:43:32.613]  If the Democrats really were seeking power, and we kind of hope for gridlock here, this is one of the things we dream about, but if they really were serious about trying to win elections and spend the billions of dollars that you great Americans are sending them to try to give us some semblance of freedom and liberty here, again, an honest contribution, not getting an honest result,
[00:43:32.873 --> 00:43:35.935]  Then they would get out and they would use all of this stuff to their advantage.
[00:43:35.975 --> 00:43:51.507]  They don't, and the reason they don't is for the same reason that Bill Clinton really couldn't go after George Bush and vice versa, because they're in it together, and if you start digging and you find out what the connections are, the American people will overthrow the one-party system.
[00:43:52.167 --> 00:43:52.687]  Simple as that.
[00:43:53.168 --> 00:43:59.412]  I want to thank you for your good man, and it's great to come to this show every day, and I hope somebody out there...
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:08.211]  Well, let's get aggressive and use your point to again prove the fact that there's a one-party system and the Democrats aren't going to come save us from Bush.
[00:44:17.664 --> 00:44:23.788]  We have to get that out to people, and I don't want to have the solution be third parties either.
[00:44:24.288 --> 00:44:26.649]  I still have some faith left in politics.
[00:44:26.669 --> 00:44:29.751]  We had Ron Paul on our show yesterday, and he does a pretty good job.
[00:44:31.212 --> 00:44:41.378]  It's candidates that we need, vetted candidates that are able to give us full disclosure on their activities, that don't take money from lobbyists or special interest groups, that aren't under the
[00:44:41.618 --> 00:44:44.919]  I think the issue of the arrest warrant for Osama Bin Laden is interesting because
[00:45:12.418 --> 00:45:25.721]  I saw a copy of the Interpol arrest warrant, published a photocopy of it in a book from a European author, and it doesn't seem to really meet the requirements of a standard arrest warrant.
[00:45:25.801 --> 00:45:26.781]  Yeah, that's an understatement.
[00:45:27.802 --> 00:45:41.285]  Also, I think the kind of scandals that have been discovered in the last five years have not unseated this policy because
[00:45:41.877 --> 00:45:47.878]  The average person has not made the connection between themselves.
[00:45:48.899 --> 00:45:58.841]  Like, for example, indefinite detention or execution of an American, whether it's at home or in a foreign country.
[00:45:58.881 --> 00:46:00.802]  Why worry about it until it happens to you?
[00:46:00.862 --> 00:46:01.482]  I mean, so what?
[00:46:01.502 --> 00:46:06.383]  Your neighbors are being taken through rendition and sent to Poland or Egypt or something.
[00:46:06.403 --> 00:46:07.963]  They just disappear for two years.
[00:46:08.043 --> 00:46:09.104]  Nobody knows where they went.
[00:46:09.304 --> 00:46:10.924]  As long as it doesn't happen to you, who cares?
[00:46:11.334 --> 00:46:15.317]  Well, did you hear about the... I'm being sarcastic for people that didn't get that.
[00:46:15.337 --> 00:46:16.417]  I just want to make sure people know.
[00:46:16.918 --> 00:46:22.621]  Did you hear about the Aaron Brown who works on CNN News?
[00:46:22.761 --> 00:46:23.962]  I know Aaron very well.
[00:46:24.022 --> 00:46:26.724]  I grew up in Seattle where he came up on TV.
[00:46:26.744 --> 00:46:27.764]  Go ahead.
[00:46:28.525 --> 00:46:31.267]  Well, he had a story about the CIA.
[00:46:31.307 --> 00:46:36.370]  This was a few years ago where the CIA had declared its power to...
[00:46:37.185 --> 00:46:52.073]  Simply eliminate an American on American soil, not arrest an American, and not kill an American because of, let's say, a hostage situation, but simply eliminate a political opponent that way.
[00:46:52.093 --> 00:47:06.241]  And his news editor, David Borman, squelched the story, and that was covered on a Now episode, the David Boccaccio series, how David Borman squashed the...
[00:47:07.199 --> 00:47:09.119]  The story that Aaron Brown was going to air.
[00:47:09.159 --> 00:47:10.540]  It's not a big secret, though, Fred.
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:17.001]  I have a story on my website, Mainstream Media, that Bush has already bragged that he has the power to assassinate anybody he wants.
[00:47:17.301 --> 00:47:30.383]  What's even more concerning is that about a year and a half ago, Israel came out and said, well, we'd like to assassinate people in the United States that we feel are enemies of Israel, much like they do in Palestine on a daily basis.
[00:47:30.803 --> 00:47:33.884]  And it was all perfectly cleared, perfectly okay with Bush.
[00:47:34.304 --> 00:47:38.789]  I think that's already clear from documents, but you know, the average person doesn't read documents.
[00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:41.632]  Do they read my website?
[00:47:41.652 --> 00:47:44.014]  I mean, I break it down for people in two paragraphs.
[00:47:44.034 --> 00:47:45.556]  There's not going to be a lot of homework here.
[00:47:46.137 --> 00:47:55.066]  Yeah, well, the thing is that the average person is afraid, so when you combine fear and ignorance, you're going to have the result that you apparently have.
[00:47:55.126 --> 00:47:56.147]  A very toxic mix.
[00:47:56.447 --> 00:47:56.848]  Right, bye-bye.
[00:47:57.695 --> 00:47:58.496]  Hey, thanks, Fred, man.
[00:47:58.516 --> 00:47:59.337]  Appreciate the call.
[00:47:59.357 --> 00:48:00.217]  You keep the faith, buddy.
[00:48:00.478 --> 00:48:02.839]  Tyler in Washington State, thank you for holding.
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.201]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:48:04.861 --> 00:48:05.922]  Hey, can you hear me, Jack?
[00:48:06.142 --> 00:48:06.543]  I can.
[00:48:07.223 --> 00:48:08.364]  Okay, well, I got a cell phone.
[00:48:08.384 --> 00:48:09.185]  I'll make this quick.
[00:48:09.545 --> 00:48:18.092]  I've been watching this, you know, news work with the Alza Cowrie Network, you know, like you, like you said, I'm sick and tired of seeing it.
[00:48:18.112 --> 00:48:19.133]  How can you watch it?
[00:48:19.273 --> 00:48:22.536]  I couldn't watch 10 seconds of it before I was exasperated.
[00:48:23.035 --> 00:48:31.322]  Well, you know, my wife, I was telling her, because I just laughed about it, I was like, hey, honey, here we are in this house, which is bigger than that house I saw get bombed.
[00:48:31.902 --> 00:48:38.087]  And, you know, they dropped two bombs that were the size of a Chevy big block.
[00:48:38.307 --> 00:48:38.908]  Carbon bombs?
[00:48:39.348 --> 00:48:51.138]  Through this house with military high-grade explosives and maybe tweeters, a spatula, you know what I mean?
[00:48:51.178 --> 00:48:51.338]  But
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:55.301]  Here's this guy who's... They clean him up and he looks pretty good.
[00:48:55.581 --> 00:48:56.541]  You know what I mean, Dak?
[00:48:56.602 --> 00:48:58.722]  It's like, hey, what are you guys thinking here?
[00:48:58.862 --> 00:49:05.564]  You know, they wouldn't find enough of that guy to, you know, show enough.
[00:49:05.924 --> 00:49:08.205]  Norrie made a good point about this last night on Coast to Coast.
[00:49:08.285 --> 00:49:15.327]  I mean, he didn't go into it as extensively as we might have here on the Alex Jones Show, but he did ask a very important question.
[00:49:15.347 --> 00:49:16.588]  Where are the rest of the people?
[00:49:16.648 --> 00:49:20.209]  If we could drag Zaccali out in perfect condition, where are the other bodies?
[00:49:20.629 --> 00:49:21.790]  Can we see what happened to those?
[00:49:21.970 --> 00:49:28.136]  But, you know, since we're supposedly quote-unquote conspiracy theorists, okay, let me give you a conspiracy theory.
[00:49:28.397 --> 00:49:30.078]  Look, this is called editorial, folks.
[00:49:30.118 --> 00:49:32.200]  Everybody does it from Rush Limbaugh on down.
[00:49:32.541 --> 00:49:34.082]  And I'll give you my take on this.
[00:49:34.122 --> 00:49:43.872]  And that is, the guy that came out in that video a month or two ago, where the first time we saw Zekawi had trouble operating his Kalashnikov, okay?
[00:49:43.972 --> 00:49:44.132]  Yeah.
[00:49:45.073 --> 00:49:56.744]  This was the volunteered Patsy who probably had no idea that he would be poisoned or killed, put on ice, and rolled out in this phony assassination that we're all seeing today on the front page of the newspaper.
[00:49:57.164 --> 00:49:57.705]  Exactly.
[00:49:58.045 --> 00:50:00.767]  Hey, I was going to ask you, since you're going to talk to Tex Mars...
[00:50:02.414 --> 00:50:08.417]  Can you ask him how familiar he is with the book Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand, a.k.a.
[00:50:08.537 --> 00:50:09.498]  Alice Rosenbaum?
[00:50:09.558 --> 00:50:12.499]  I'm sure he's not only read it, but he's studied it extensively.
[00:50:12.519 --> 00:50:27.687]  Yeah, I mean, all that is is a big 800-page volume of Philip Drew Esquire, if you're familiar with that book, by Colonel House, who was, you know, Wilson's Karl Rove, so to speak.
[00:50:28.536 --> 00:50:29.337]  Well, I'll put it to him.
[00:50:29.357 --> 00:50:30.157]  We'll see what he says.
[00:50:30.237 --> 00:50:31.298]  Thanks for the call, Tyler.
[00:50:31.318 --> 00:50:31.939]  Appreciate it.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.261]  We're just about to go to break.
[00:50:34.381 --> 00:50:36.402]  I did want to try to play this Ann Coulter clip.
[00:50:36.442 --> 00:50:38.244]  We might have time in the next segment.
[00:50:38.264 --> 00:50:38.784]  We might not.
[00:50:38.824 --> 00:50:41.006]  I'll definitely get it in here before the end of the show.
[00:50:41.026 --> 00:50:41.827]  It's pretty funny.
[00:50:42.547 --> 00:50:43.588]  Oberman's coming along.
[00:50:43.868 --> 00:50:44.789]  Must be our A. Keith!
[00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:46.411]  I just wanted to say hi, Keith.
[00:50:46.571 --> 00:50:50.093]  Good that you listened to the Alex Jones Show and you're picking up a few points here.
[00:50:50.813 --> 00:50:51.894]  Keep listening, buddy.
[00:50:51.974 --> 00:50:52.735]  We're working with you.
[00:50:52.755 --> 00:50:54.375]  We'll be right back after this.
[00:50:54.596 --> 00:50:58.038]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:50:58.058 --> 00:50:58.478]  Stay tuned.
[00:51:01.886 --> 00:51:10.152]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[00:51:10.332 --> 00:51:12.654]  We're expecting around a thousand people in attendance.
[00:51:13.274 --> 00:51:22.121]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[00:51:22.641 --> 00:51:26.164]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda.
[00:51:26.604 --> 00:51:47.401]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Tarpley, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[00:51:47.721 --> 00:51:51.484]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[00:51:51.925 --> 00:51:53.146]  Arm yourself with the truth.

[00:52:02.097 --> 00:52:06.000]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:52:06.220 --> 00:52:11.665]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:52:11.945 --> 00:52:22.293]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:52:22.473 --> 00:52:26.817]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:52:26.997 --> 00:52:35.323]  Trihalomethane and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:52:35.623 --> 00:52:41.968]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[00:52:42.088 --> 00:52:42.328]  That's 888-803-4438.

[00:54:25.886 --> 00:54:32.149]  Well folks, if I sound a little hyper today,
[00:54:51.818 --> 00:54:52.338]  Could be.
[00:54:52.458 --> 00:54:53.819]  I take a supplement called Enerfood.
[00:54:53.839 --> 00:54:54.659]  It's just fantastic.
[00:54:54.679 --> 00:54:55.719]  It gets me really going.
[00:54:55.759 --> 00:55:12.143]  But I am really, really excited about the Super Bowl of all 9-11 conferences, and that is the conference that will be organized and held by Alex Jones here in just about two weeks, June 24th to June 25th in Los Angeles, the American Scholars Symposium.
[00:55:12.683 --> 00:55:19.967]  Some of the most renowned experts, the most credible witnesses and experts on 9-11 will be present.
[00:55:20.027 --> 00:55:21.267]  A lot of surprises.
[00:55:21.908 --> 00:55:24.409]  And I'm glad to see, I mean, hey, we don't know.
[00:55:24.449 --> 00:55:27.750]  This could be the biggest 9-11 event we've ever had and ever will have.
[00:55:28.031 --> 00:55:31.732]  I assume that they'll just get bigger and bigger and bigger from here.
[00:55:31.792 --> 00:55:36.935]  But to my objective mind, I really believe that this is the biggest one we've had so far.
[00:55:37.915 --> 00:55:39.316]  You're really not going to want to miss this.
[00:55:39.416 --> 00:55:40.777]  I'm getting really excited to go.
[00:55:40.797 --> 00:55:42.478]  I haven't been to Los Angeles for a long time.
[00:55:42.538 --> 00:55:46.160]  I lived in the police state of California for many years.
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:52.463]  But I'm excited to go back, see my old friends, see all of you, meet all of you, see a preview of the new Alex Jones film.
[00:55:52.483 --> 00:55:56.165]  And I've got to tell you, folks, I got a sneak preview last night in the Infowars studio.
[00:55:56.445 --> 00:55:58.746]  If you think the other videos are good, you're going to be blown away.
[00:55:58.746 --> 00:56:01.368]  Flown away by this new video.
[00:56:01.388 --> 00:56:03.629]  It is absolutely amazing.
[00:56:03.890 --> 00:56:06.471]  But I want everybody to get out to this 9-11 conference.
[00:56:06.511 --> 00:56:08.113]  Tickets are going fast, okay?
[00:56:08.333 --> 00:56:10.574]  We're closing into the event itself.
[00:56:10.854 --> 00:56:16.018]  You're going to need to go to InfoWars.com and get those tickets ASAP while you still can.
[00:56:16.038 --> 00:56:18.880]  You're going to kick yourself if you don't go to this conference.
[00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:23.703]  You're going to hear so much exuberance coming out of Los Angeles at this conference.
[00:56:24.024 --> 00:56:26.625]  If you don't go, you're going to be really mad at yourself.
[00:56:26.705 --> 00:56:27.266]  Go ahead and
[00:56:27.606 --> 00:56:28.147]  We're good to go.
[00:56:28.167 --> 00:56:28.787]  We're good to go.
[00:56:47.546 --> 00:56:50.127]  Professor James Fetzer of the 9-11 Scholars for Truth.
[00:56:50.207 --> 00:56:52.989]  Webster Griffin Tarpley, who is just amazing.
[00:56:53.049 --> 00:56:55.610]  Every time he speaks, I learn something from him.
[00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:59.132]  Of course, Professor Stephen Jones will be making an appearance there.
[00:56:59.192 --> 00:57:00.532]  Dylan Avery will be there.
[00:57:00.612 --> 00:57:01.973]  And a lot of surprises.
[00:57:02.013 --> 00:57:04.714]  Of course, Alex Jones giving a keynote address speech.
[00:57:04.734 --> 00:57:06.355]  I want to see everybody out there.
[00:57:06.375 --> 00:57:08.096]  You can call for tickets at
[00:57:09.276 --> 00:57:10.317]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[00:57:10.677 --> 00:57:18.880]  You'll also be the first to see this new movie, which, as I say, is simply amazing.
[00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:24.163]  888-253-3139, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:57:24.403 --> 00:57:31.506]  While you're there and while you call in, ask about some of the specials on the past videos, including the famous 9-11 road to tyranny.
[00:57:32.026 --> 00:57:34.067]  That had a lot to do with my education.
[00:57:34.827 --> 00:57:38.771]  I've watched that probably about 80 times, and I always seem to learn something new.
[00:57:39.112 --> 00:57:45.639]  And Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State, another great film, and I think it's adequately put.
[00:57:45.719 --> 00:57:47.541]  That's four documentaries in one.
[00:57:47.561 --> 00:57:50.104]  You're literally getting four documentaries for one price.
[00:57:50.224 --> 00:57:55.850]  Also, if you join Prison Planet TV, you get all of this stuff for one very low price.
[00:57:56.070 --> 00:57:56.931]  We're good to go.
[00:57:56.951 --> 00:57:57.371]  I think?
[00:58:24.210 --> 00:58:24.350]  Hello?
[00:58:24.370 --> 00:58:24.590]  Hello?
[00:58:58.145 --> 00:58:58.785]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.446 --> 00:59:00.506]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.207 --> 00:59:02.328]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.968 --> 00:59:03.789]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.550 --> 00:59:05.471]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.111 --> 00:59:09.774]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.295 --> 00:59:14.418]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:19.262 --> 00:59:21.063]  Well, of course this isn't Alex Jones.
[00:59:21.364 --> 00:59:24.987]  That's pretty easy to detect by now if you've listened to me for the last day or two.
[00:59:25.969 --> 00:59:32.110]  But we are doing our best, attempting our utmost to fill the giant shoes of Alex Jones today.
[00:59:32.610 --> 00:59:37.751]  Alex Jones, of course, at the Bilderberg Conference, covering that event like it's never been covered before.
[00:59:38.291 --> 00:59:40.512]  And hopefully he'll be calling in today to give us an update.
[00:59:40.532 --> 00:59:41.352]  I'm sure he will.
[00:59:41.372 --> 00:59:47.713]  Of course, Alex will be back Monday to bring you more news and information you're not getting anywhere else.
[00:59:47.733 --> 00:59:48.693]  So stay tuned for that.
[00:59:48.713 --> 00:59:50.574]  We're going to go back to your calls here in just a bit.
[00:59:50.834 --> 00:59:52.874]  But we do have Rick Siegel with us today.
[00:59:53.414 --> 00:59:55.056]  Yeah, thank you very much.
[01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:26.322]  Okay, well, how I got into it, I was dragged into this vortex by some Danish investigators who found my footage on the internet and realized it was mine and asked me if I wouldn't show the whole thing.
[01:00:26.362 --> 01:00:27.603]  And I did.
[01:00:27.643 --> 01:00:29.024]  I didn't realize it was a problem.
[01:00:30.086 --> 01:00:36.128]  Well, when you say footage, let's bring people out of the dark and let them know exactly what the footage is that's so controversial here.
[01:00:36.488 --> 01:00:50.592]  Okay, well, the footage is I woke up that morning to the bang and heard some, they reported some small airplane had hit the tower, so I ran into the shower to get my cameras ready or get myself ready and go out and get the picture.
[01:00:50.612 --> 01:00:56.654]  By the time I get out, the second tower they announced got hit and I realized something bigger was going on and
[01:00:57.282 --> 01:00:57.922]  I zoomed down.
[01:00:57.962 --> 01:01:02.125]  I lived in Hoboken, so I went down to the river with a lot of cameras.
[01:01:02.225 --> 01:01:12.992]  I had a lot of professional gear because I was president of online TV, a very large internet broadcasting network, and so I had a lot of professional gear.
[01:01:13.032 --> 01:01:19.976]  I took down my tripod and a professional Sony 3CCD camera and set it up and started to film.
[01:01:21.738 --> 01:01:29.821]  We'll give people an idea, again, if they haven't seen the video, and I've just seen a few clips of it myself, so I'll kind of play along here with a lot of the listeners.
[01:01:30.241 --> 01:01:45.426]  Tell us exactly what you caught that day, and again, let's remember, folks, when these events happen, and Rick just happened to be in New York when this happened, when any of this stuff happens, grab your cameras, get out, and start getting footage immediately, because this is how it progresses.
[01:01:45.446 --> 01:01:46.267]  This is what we need.
[01:01:46.507 --> 01:01:49.868]  But Rick Siegel, tell us exactly what you caught with your video cameras.
[01:01:50.365 --> 01:02:01.187]  Well, with the video camera, I caught all the explosions, all the building collapses, the two main towers and the Tower 7.
[01:02:01.927 --> 01:02:03.947]  And I caught all the explosions.
[01:02:04.108 --> 01:02:09.869]  And when they occurred, everything was just recorded on the tape as it occurred.
[01:02:09.989 --> 01:02:11.289]  So it's like a Zapruder.
[01:02:11.349 --> 01:02:12.249]  I'm just filming this.
[01:02:12.269 --> 01:02:14.669]  It was on a tripod, which is very good.
[01:02:14.709 --> 01:02:17.590]  You always should set up on a tripod so you get your best resolution.
[01:02:18.482 --> 01:02:23.724]  And because I was across from the river, everything's amplified, and I got all the sounds beautifully.
[01:02:24.464 --> 01:02:45.150]  And later, everyone can look at the magic show, because you're just looking at what's going on, and you gotta, later on, you can see what's going on on the sides, what happened below it, and, you know, you're looking at the burning building on the top, and you're not thinking how long a sound comes across a river, and how long it takes for explosions, and you're not looking at the foot of the building when it's exploding, when it's burning at the top.
[01:02:46.047 --> 01:02:49.329]  What are we going to see in your footage that we haven't already seen on network news?
[01:02:50.189 --> 01:02:56.092]  You're going to see the seven laws of science prove treason, fraud, and murder by the buildings exploding.
[01:02:56.152 --> 01:02:59.933]  And we come up with some weapons of mass destruction how to do this.
[01:03:00.013 --> 01:03:06.837]  No pancake is going to make all that powder out of two gigantic buildings that were standing in front of us.
[01:03:07.557 --> 01:03:09.678]  Would you ever get in a building if that was the truth?
[01:03:10.851 --> 01:03:16.433]  Well, I mean, look, I probably would because the fact is no building has ever imploded like that.
[01:03:16.473 --> 01:03:21.535]  No building has ever come down, no skyscraper has ever come down by fire before or since 9-11.
[01:03:21.975 --> 01:03:24.176]  So I'd actually feel pretty safe in a skyscraper.
[01:03:24.196 --> 01:03:29.117]  Because you know that, well, like the only way that's going to happen is if they want to bring that down again.
[01:03:29.157 --> 01:03:33.439]  And that's why we all feel confident we get into these buildings.
[01:03:33.659 --> 01:03:36.440]  Well, that one, we're confident it couldn't have fallen that way.
[01:03:37.242 --> 01:03:37.863]  Stay with us.
[01:03:37.923 --> 01:03:38.804]  Rick Siegel with us.
[01:03:38.824 --> 01:03:40.446]  9-11 eyewitness Hoboken.
[01:03:40.466 --> 01:03:43.249]  That's a video, of course, we're carrying here at Infowars.com.
[01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:43.910]  Stay tuned.
[01:03:43.930 --> 01:03:45.572]  I'm Jack Blood filling in for Alex Jones.
[01:03:45.692 --> 01:03:47.895]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.

[01:03:53.789 --> 01:04:02.058]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[01:04:02.259 --> 01:04:04.601]  We're expecting around a thousand people in attendance.
[01:04:05.202 --> 01:04:14.052]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[01:04:14.552 --> 01:04:18.073]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda.
[01:04:18.533 --> 01:04:39.301]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Charmley, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[01:04:39.641 --> 01:04:43.382]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.

[01:06:28.879 --> 01:06:29.259]  We're good to go.
[01:06:53.922 --> 01:06:59.544]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.648 --> 01:07:10.748]  Chris Siegel is with us.
[01:07:10.969 --> 01:07:14.550]  His video 9-11 Eyewitness, the Hoboken video.
[01:07:15.837 --> 01:07:17.478]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:07:17.558 --> 01:07:18.698]  You're over in Spain.
[01:07:18.718 --> 01:07:19.738]  Am I supposed to say that or not?
[01:07:39.824 --> 01:07:41.405]  Yeah, it doesn't matter now, right, Jack?
[01:07:41.425 --> 01:07:42.066]  It's okay.
[01:07:42.426 --> 01:07:46.129]  I'm in Europe and I'm at least halfway out there from them.
[01:07:46.569 --> 01:07:56.297]  The reason I'm trying to be careful here is I know, and this is one of the things I wanted you to get into, is the FBI came and raided your offices, took all your servers.
[01:07:56.317 --> 01:07:57.698]  You haven't been able to get those back.
[01:07:58.058 --> 01:08:04.363]  I'd like you to talk about what happened there and what kind of an ordeal you've been through in order to get your property from the FBI.
[01:08:04.423 --> 01:08:04.783]  Why?
[01:08:05.003 --> 01:08:06.805]  What excuse they might have given you for all of this?
[01:08:07.293 --> 01:08:08.834]  Well, it wasn't exactly like that, Jack.
[01:08:08.874 --> 01:08:13.936]  It was more the Department of Defense invested in the company that was hosting my servers.
[01:08:13.956 --> 01:08:17.097]  This was back in September, actually October of 2001.
[01:08:17.177 --> 01:08:28.141]  We were the only people that were up, very capable of staying up through the event because we were on the other side of town and had diesel generators to keep the power on.
[01:08:28.881 --> 01:08:31.883]  So they came over, they invested in that company.
[01:08:31.983 --> 01:08:32.963]  I didn't know about this.
[01:08:33.507 --> 01:08:42.892]  And slowly they took control of it and all of a sudden they grabbed my servers with no warning and took them off and with lawyers or anything I wasn't able to obtain those servers back.
[01:08:44.113 --> 01:08:51.977]  I didn't really understand the depth of what was in my material because I shot an angle from Hoboken that no one else had.
[01:08:52.478 --> 01:08:57.340]  No one had ever seen all that footage and seen the actual destruction and how it occurred.
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:00.042]  They showed selective pictures so that they could...
[01:09:01.095 --> 01:09:14.460]  You know, when you say that, it sounds to me that you captured something that they don't want the world to see.
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:23.364]  Well, yeah, there's all the evidence of the explosions that match up to the seismic data, and it shows it coming from below and not from the top.
[01:09:23.979 --> 01:09:31.366]  And when they move the, because we're sitting two miles away, so we've got to do eight or nine seconds, it changes when those explosions happen.
[01:09:31.666 --> 01:09:39.132]  When we watched it real time on Hoboken Pier, we're two miles away, and it's taking at least eight or nine seconds for the sound to get there.
[01:09:39.433 --> 01:09:42.816]  But we're watching the top of the building and hearing the explosion at the same time.
[01:09:43.336 --> 01:09:46.099]  So no one sat back and said, oh, wow, there's a flash of light.
[01:09:46.159 --> 01:09:51.103]  We should count eight seconds, or count how many seconds it takes before we hear the explosions.
[01:09:51.721 --> 01:09:56.365]  So we heard the explosions at the same time as we're seeing the actual building falling.
[01:09:57.005 --> 01:10:00.228]  So it was way before and no one thought about that at the time.
[01:10:01.989 --> 01:10:04.031]  When did the video first come out, Rick?
[01:10:04.091 --> 01:10:06.533]  I see you have a 2006 copyright here.
[01:10:06.573 --> 01:10:07.414]  When did it first come out?
[01:10:07.814 --> 01:10:09.455]  That's when we brought out the DVD.
[01:10:09.475 --> 01:10:16.501]  We brought out the complete record and brought it into the high quality in September 11th when we came into New York for that.
[01:10:18.050 --> 01:10:24.214]  You know, I'd like to ask you, what was the hosting company that was invested in the DoD?
[01:10:24.234 --> 01:10:25.895]  I don't know if you can reveal that information.
[01:10:26.115 --> 01:10:27.816]  Who was your provider?
[01:10:27.836 --> 01:10:29.597]  Stealth Communications.
[01:10:29.877 --> 01:10:31.238]  Stealth Communications.
[01:10:31.278 --> 01:10:32.679]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:10:32.719 --> 01:10:34.480]  If you can get my servers back, I want them.
[01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:35.961]  If they still got them.
[01:10:36.041 --> 01:10:38.102]  That's got 6,000 hours of my entertainment.
[01:10:38.682 --> 01:10:42.765]  You know, I didn't want to end up making 9-11 or conspiracy films.
[01:10:42.885 --> 01:10:44.726]  I was into entertainment, not this.
[01:10:46.075 --> 01:10:52.201]  Well, no, like a lot of us, I mean, we were all going about our merry way until 9-11, and you're definitely a perfect example of that.
[01:10:53.121 --> 01:11:00.368]  How rampant do you think this is, that the Department of Defense is investing into Internet server providers around the globe?
[01:11:00.828 --> 01:11:07.975]  Well, the reason they grabbed Stealth Communications, and you should note this, is that they were a hub that stayed up huge.
[01:11:08.135 --> 01:11:12.159]  We had their... I was with them since the beginning because they could broadcast...
[01:11:12.918 --> 01:11:15.480]  This kind of stuff over the Internet back in those days.
[01:11:15.781 --> 01:11:17.742]  And I helped to bring them the technology.
[01:11:18.163 --> 01:11:23.327]  So now they became the IRC Internet Chat Relay Hub of the whole country.
[01:11:23.647 --> 01:11:25.149]  So all chat came through them.
[01:11:25.169 --> 01:11:27.290]  Well, the Department of Defense would love to have that.
[01:11:27.671 --> 01:11:32.775]  Now as a reward for grabbing my servers, this company has now been awarded the VOIP Hub.
[01:11:33.095 --> 01:11:36.038]  They are now the big fiber hub for all voiceover.
[01:11:36.058 --> 01:11:40.662]  As a matter of fact, if this is going over Skype, this would be going through their systems.
[01:11:42.034 --> 01:11:57.731]  You know, when we were, I mentioned this yesterday, when we were investigating the Nick Berg beheading, we found a lot of collusion between a number of internet server providers, people that would actually put up and maintain the capacity to put out your website.
[01:11:57.811 --> 01:12:00.754]  I'm not really comfortable with mentioning their names on this program.
[01:12:00.794 --> 01:12:03.597]  I would mention them on my own program because I've got nothing to lose.
[01:12:04.137 --> 01:12:16.887]  But we see that there is a lot of open collusion and conflicts of interest, whether it be government sources along with commercial sources, and then right in the middle is Rick Siegel, all the listeners, and Jack Blood.
[01:12:17.528 --> 01:12:18.829]  Right, exactly.
[01:12:19.509 --> 01:12:22.492]  This is the question I wanted to get answered.
[01:12:22.532 --> 01:12:23.712]  Did they give you an excuse?
[01:12:23.813 --> 01:12:25.954]  I mean, obviously they can't just take all your stuff.
[01:12:26.334 --> 01:12:27.856]  I'm sure you tried to fight to get it back.
[01:12:27.896 --> 01:12:30.097]  I mean, what was the pretext that they took all of this?
[01:12:30.117 --> 01:12:30.658]  $1,500 in back bills.
[01:12:33.923 --> 01:12:36.344]  And I'm sure you had the $1,500 to give them.
[01:12:36.424 --> 01:12:39.566]  Yeah, I had lawyers to walk in and do it, and then they said, well, we destroyed them.
[01:12:40.006 --> 01:12:41.347]  They're no longer available.
[01:12:41.367 --> 01:12:46.130]  There's like three gigantic servers with $2 million worth of data on them.
[01:12:46.250 --> 01:12:47.030]  Unbelievable.
[01:12:47.210 --> 01:12:49.512]  I assume you're in the process of a lawsuit?
[01:12:50.072 --> 01:12:51.593]  Well, I've got to have money to do that.
[01:12:51.633 --> 01:12:52.974]  I don't make any money anymore.
[01:12:53.154 --> 01:12:54.575]  They just crushed all the sites again.
[01:12:54.635 --> 01:12:58.337]  My host actually disappeared off the face of the earth.
[01:12:58.377 --> 01:13:02.439]  Like, 31 of my commercial sites, online TV, music TV, movies, just wiped off.
[01:13:02.958 --> 01:13:04.538]  Rick, I'm told you're going to be speaking at the L.A.
[01:13:04.578 --> 01:13:05.099]  conference?
[01:13:05.119 --> 01:13:05.179]  Yep.
[01:13:32.506 --> 01:13:33.686]  They tried to stop that, too.
[01:13:33.726 --> 01:13:41.388]  The airline tried to flood my bank card with charges so that I couldn't even charge the account.
[01:13:41.768 --> 01:13:44.128]  But it's lucky I have a close enough tie with the bank.
[01:13:44.148 --> 01:13:45.468]  God, I can't believe that.
[01:13:45.989 --> 01:13:48.609]  And I talked to them, and they were like, no, no, we see what they're doing.
[01:13:48.629 --> 01:13:49.709]  We have to wait until they're finished.
[01:13:49.729 --> 01:13:52.350]  They're doing hundreds and hundreds of bogus authorizations.
[01:13:52.370 --> 01:13:54.410]  I'm like, why is the airline doing that?
[01:13:54.450 --> 01:13:55.470]  It's ridiculous.
[01:13:55.530 --> 01:13:57.131]  I just want this ticket before it's gone.
[01:13:57.151 --> 01:13:58.831]  There's only one seat left, so I got it.
[01:13:59.437 --> 01:14:04.881]  Got my seed and I got it anyway because we worked around them with the help of the bank.
[01:14:04.901 --> 01:14:08.563]  What is going to be the crux of your conversation out in L.A.
[01:14:08.583 --> 01:14:09.203]  in two weeks here?
[01:14:10.024 --> 01:14:13.706]  Try to get people to activate and do something about the situation that we're in.
[01:14:13.726 --> 01:14:16.588]  We're in a lost, otherwise we're going to really be in a lost cause.
[01:14:16.628 --> 01:14:17.669]  There won't be anything to do.
[01:14:18.089 --> 01:14:26.475]  And I hope to get people to come and march in Washington and bring into the, for the Constitution Day, bring back the Constitution into the Republic.
[01:14:26.923 --> 01:14:32.328]  Are you guys planning or is there something in the works to show your video or parts of your video at the conference?
[01:14:32.348 --> 01:14:32.628]  Oh, yeah.
[01:14:32.648 --> 01:14:36.651]  I've got a great one hour that I'm doing, plus I'm doing a question and answer there.
[01:14:36.671 --> 01:14:37.772]  I've got a great segment.
[01:14:37.832 --> 01:14:41.195]  Alex has set me up very, very well so I can speak to the people.
[01:14:42.532 --> 01:14:44.513]  And I'm ready to tell them what happened.
[01:14:44.774 --> 01:14:45.794]  Well, show them the pictures.
[01:14:46.014 --> 01:14:46.455]  You look.
[01:14:46.695 --> 01:14:47.896]  I'll tell you what was there.
[01:14:47.916 --> 01:14:54.440]  We've got scientists to back up and show simple science and seven laws of science that prove treason, fraud, and murder.
[01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:59.023]  I want to go over those seven laws, if we can, after we come back from the next break.
[01:14:59.263 --> 01:15:02.906]  But I've got to tell you, just to openly admit, I am a complete...
[01:15:03.646 --> 01:15:05.068]  Physics and science nut.
[01:15:05.148 --> 01:15:09.611]  It's one of my hobbies and has been for quite some time, so this really hits me where I live.
[01:15:09.631 --> 01:15:18.619]  You talk about Newton's first law, Newton's second law, the law of conservation of momentum, Newton's third law for every action there was an equal and opposite reaction.
[01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:32.199]  High power, ejected steel beams, explosives, pulverized concrete, the law of gravity, free fall in a vacuum, a very important point here, the law of projectile motion, the law of increasing entropy.
[01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:33.441]  I have to think that if...
[01:15:34.671 --> 01:15:37.795]  If Albert Einstein was around today, get a real kick out of your video.
[01:15:38.116 --> 01:15:38.416]  Yeah.
[01:15:39.438 --> 01:15:41.100]  And it's simple science stuff.
[01:15:41.701 --> 01:15:49.050]  Well, and it has to be relatable to the layman, and I know you've been able to do that in this, and that's exactly what Stephen Jones has attempted to do.
[01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:49.491]  That's right.
[01:15:50.031 --> 01:15:53.293]  That's why I love Stephen Hawking so much, because he's able to do that as well.
[01:15:53.633 --> 01:16:01.398]  But, I mean, look, if we can't break this down on a scientific level with scholarly work, then obviously we'll never have any credibility.
[01:16:01.418 --> 01:16:03.919]  And I think that's what we've been able to do for the last year or two.
[01:16:03.979 --> 01:16:08.762]  And probably why, Rick, maybe you'll agree with this, maybe you won't, probably why we're getting so much momentum.
[01:16:09.282 --> 01:16:09.922]  Could be, yeah.
[01:16:10.122 --> 01:16:12.344]  Well, people look and they see, they go, my God.
[01:16:13.204 --> 01:16:14.965]  They get down to the real basics.
[01:16:15.005 --> 01:16:16.726]  That's why they like Building 7 the most.
[01:16:16.746 --> 01:16:18.227]  It's like, look at that insanity.
[01:16:18.717 --> 01:16:19.581]  You think these are bad?
[01:16:19.621 --> 01:16:20.223]  Look at this.
[01:16:20.424 --> 01:16:20.584]  Yeah.
[01:16:21.388 --> 01:16:22.130]  Well, I mean, look, we...
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:30.023]  In fact, give me your reaction to the Pentagon PsyOps video that was released just about a month ago.
[01:16:30.043 --> 01:16:32.964]  There was a lot of hubbub about that, which died down real quick.
[01:16:33.024 --> 01:16:47.891]  My easy analysis was, I thought this was put out almost to drive a wedge between a very controversial aspect of 9-11 research, and I was really very glad to see that it not only didn't divide the 9-11 truth movement, but it brought people together.
[01:16:47.911 --> 01:16:51.853]  Sorry, it not only did that, but it gave the other people, my father, who's
[01:16:52.253 --> 01:16:56.076]  Fairly skeptical, but he still knows corruption's just 100% there.
[01:16:56.136 --> 01:16:58.878]  He's like, what the hell are they bringing that up?
[01:16:59.058 --> 01:17:00.219]  I couldn't see any, Jeff.
[01:17:00.599 --> 01:17:01.840]  What the hell are they saying?
[01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:04.902]  So it gives other... It had nothing in it.
[01:17:04.942 --> 01:17:06.563]  It's like, here, here's those five frames.
[01:17:06.643 --> 01:17:07.084]  What'd they do?
[01:17:07.164 --> 01:17:10.406]  Just officially stamp the complete garbage that everyone had already?
[01:17:11.467 --> 01:17:13.728]  It's like, okay, so what about your other 47 cameras and...
[01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:16.711]  And the ones across the road.
[01:17:16.771 --> 01:17:17.191]  Oh, sure.
[01:17:17.651 --> 01:17:31.518]  Well, this is the thing that has always amazed me about the Pentagon, is we have seen the planes crashing into the World Trade Center towers, at least, I don't know, each of us can say even subliminally, have seen these tens of thousands of times over the last five years.
[01:17:32.418 --> 01:17:34.759]  But, of course, we don't see anything at the Pentagon.
[01:17:35.039 --> 01:17:38.321]  Why do you think, I mean, give me your best analysis here, if you can, Rick.
[01:17:38.361 --> 01:17:41.802]  Why do you think that they are withholding that information?
[01:17:41.842 --> 01:17:42.903]  What would they have to gain by that?
[01:17:43.379 --> 01:17:43.659]  Well, what?
[01:17:43.739 --> 01:17:46.441]  You mean if they told us what really hit the Pentagon?
[01:17:46.501 --> 01:17:46.901]  Well, no.
[01:17:47.001 --> 01:17:48.582]  Look, the plane hit the Pentagon.
[01:17:48.622 --> 01:17:51.664]  Again, they show us how a plane hit the World Trade Center Tower.
[01:17:51.764 --> 01:17:54.665]  Obviously, they would want to show us how a plane hit the Pentagon.
[01:17:55.126 --> 01:17:56.326]  Yeah, maybe a few for use.
[01:17:56.386 --> 01:17:56.887]  Well, why?
[01:17:56.907 --> 01:17:58.588]  Because they have nothing they want to show.
[01:17:58.608 --> 01:18:01.009]  And they don't want to doctor it up too bad.
[01:18:01.798 --> 01:18:05.081]  Plus, they would have to match up with too much information that's out there already.
[01:18:05.101 --> 01:18:08.404]  There's a lot of pictures that are already... So you don't think we're ever going to see this?
[01:18:08.764 --> 01:18:10.386]  Well, that would be hard.
[01:18:11.006 --> 01:18:15.090]  Imagine, they'd have to disprove some other picture to make that one work.
[01:18:15.734 --> 01:18:16.994]  Well, here's the beautiful thing.
[01:18:17.054 --> 01:18:30.258]  I mean, years ago, they used to just go ahead and put this patent disinformation right into our faces and then laugh at us as 80% of the people just gulped it down with a Big Mac and believed it and took it all in.
[01:18:30.898 --> 01:18:44.442]  Nowadays, because there's so many great researchers out there with the technology and the know-how to break down some of these videos and some of this footage, and because so many people are off the fence and so receptive to the information we're putting out, they can't get away with it anymore.
[01:18:45.928 --> 01:18:46.889]  We'll take a quick break.
[01:18:46.929 --> 01:18:48.591]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:18:48.651 --> 01:18:51.553]  Our guest, Richard Siegel, will come right back with your calls right after this.
[01:18:51.573 --> 01:18:52.014]  Stay tuned.
[01:18:54.276 --> 01:18:56.578]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:57.078 --> 01:18:59.921]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:00.862 --> 01:19:10.471]  The best kept secret in the world today is that now it is possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:11.434 --> 01:19:15.215]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Inc.'

[01:21:57.615 --> 01:21:59.817]  Or maybe weight management has always been a problem.
[01:22:00.317 --> 01:22:05.682]  Are you frustrated, burned out, and tired of fad diets and marketing gimmicks that don't really work?

[01:23:29.478 --> 01:23:30.400]  I think.
[01:23:37.099 --> 01:23:38.500]  The one and only Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:40.141]  Jack Blood sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:23:40.181 --> 01:23:42.302]  Great guest today, Richard Siegel.
[01:23:42.422 --> 01:23:44.644]  His video is 9-11 Eyewitness.
[01:23:44.684 --> 01:23:52.268]  The Hoboken video gets into extreme physics, has exclusive footage of 9-11 you might not have ever seen.
[01:23:52.328 --> 01:23:56.451]  It's very explosive, to use a tired, trite pun.
[01:23:56.851 --> 01:23:58.312]  That's my fault, though, Rick, not yours.
[01:23:59.012 --> 01:24:01.215]  9-11-Eyewitness.com is the website.
[01:24:01.255 --> 01:24:02.417]  That's how you can get the video.
[01:24:02.457 --> 01:24:09.505]  Of course, he'll be speaking at the LA conference that we know you all will be going to, joining a great lineup of speakers.
[01:24:09.565 --> 01:24:10.406]  I'll be there as well.
[01:24:10.706 --> 01:24:11.948]  Richard, I'll look forward to meeting you there.
[01:24:12.312 --> 01:24:13.052]  Excellent, Jack.
[01:24:13.092 --> 01:24:13.752]  That's great.
[01:24:14.073 --> 01:24:15.073]  Looking forward to meeting you.
[01:24:15.413 --> 01:24:18.434]  You know what's funny is that, how about this for synchronicity?
[01:24:18.494 --> 01:24:21.535]  I don't know if you got this, but I was perusing a forum last night.
[01:24:21.575 --> 01:24:26.257]  I noticed that you sent me an email over there months ago, and I just got it.
[01:24:26.277 --> 01:24:27.757]  That's how far behind I am.
[01:24:27.777 --> 01:24:30.558]  And I just wrote you last night and said, hey, give me a call.
[01:24:30.598 --> 01:24:31.178]  Let's talk.
[01:24:31.218 --> 01:24:33.239]  And then the next thing I know, you're booked up on the program.
[01:24:33.259 --> 01:24:33.659]  Excellent.
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:35.401]  Very synchronistic.
[01:24:35.461 --> 01:24:36.663]  It works out wonderfully.
[01:24:37.043 --> 01:24:37.784]  Great.
[01:24:38.025 --> 01:24:39.547]  We have some physics to talk about.
[01:24:39.587 --> 01:24:42.430]  We have some more 9-11 information to talk about.
[01:24:42.450 --> 01:24:45.174]  We're going to keep you aboard as long as you can stay with us today.
[01:24:45.514 --> 01:24:47.057]  But I'd like to go to the calls.
[01:24:47.077 --> 01:24:49.820]  We'll get some opinions from the listeners and let them pick your brain.
[01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:50.341]  How's that sound?
[01:24:50.621 --> 01:24:52.222]  Excellent.
[01:24:52.242 --> 01:24:54.143]  Let's talk to him.
[01:24:54.163 --> 01:24:54.344]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:24:54.364 --> 01:24:55.644]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:55.724 --> 01:24:59.107]  I'm Jack Blood, filling in for Alex Jones, GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:59.327 --> 01:25:02.069]  Let's go to Adam in Pittsburgh, who's been patiently holding.
[01:25:02.369 --> 01:25:03.390]  Adam, thank you for joining us.
[01:25:03.410 --> 01:25:04.650]  You're on the air with Richard Siegel.
[01:25:05.071 --> 01:25:05.771]  Hey, how's it going?
[01:25:06.071 --> 01:25:06.512]  Very good.
[01:25:07.412 --> 01:25:10.194]  Hey, I don't really have an opinion about your movie yet.
[01:25:10.214 --> 01:25:11.675]  I haven't been able to take a look at it.
[01:25:11.695 --> 01:25:13.456]  9-11 in general is fine.
[01:25:15.037 --> 01:25:17.099]  Bookmarking it and taking a look at it later on.
[01:25:18.139 --> 01:25:19.200]  I just wanted to talk about
[01:25:20.026 --> 01:25:32.673]  Alex Jones' 15-hour interrogation in Canada, and I think it leaves an important lesson for all of us in the Patriot Movement, and that is don't bring your porn across the border.
[01:25:33.954 --> 01:25:45.560]  Can you imagine if they had found anything out of the ordinary on Alex Jones or the crew, whether it be porn on the laptop, which they didn't find, or drugs or something funky?
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:48.682]  That would be all over the front pages of the newspapers today.
[01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:50.201]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:25:50.221 --> 01:26:13.840]  I mean, the biggest thing that surprises me about that is when I was 19 years old living in western New York, I wasn't allowed to drink, but I could fill up my van with all of my buddies and drive across the lake over to Toronto, where I was allowed to go into a strip club, get completely hammered, and proceed to pay two naked chicks to get on the table in front of me and do things to each other that I probably can't say on the radio.
[01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:14.581]  No, we won't go there.
[01:26:15.309 --> 01:26:19.752]  While another one sat on my lap doing things that we probably also shouldn't say on the radio.
[01:26:19.772 --> 01:26:23.515]  Well, I think most of us knows what goes on in a topless nude bar.
[01:26:23.555 --> 01:26:28.859]  Look, and I've got to tell you, I grew up in Seattle, and we often went to Vancouver and had a little fun there.
[01:26:28.899 --> 01:26:31.741]  They had some of the most beautiful women there that you could find.
[01:26:31.801 --> 01:26:35.083]  So I, like you, have maybe a jaded past.
[01:26:35.163 --> 01:26:36.844]  But, yeah, it's really hypocritical.
[01:26:36.884 --> 01:26:38.706]  One of the things that's also very interesting...
[01:26:39.426 --> 01:26:40.047]  That's not the case now.
[01:26:40.067 --> 01:26:40.547]  Yeah, I did.
[01:26:40.587 --> 01:26:41.448]  It's an outrage.
[01:26:41.608 --> 01:26:41.968]  And, uh...
[01:27:09.497 --> 01:27:14.383]  It just goes to show that they do watch, and people don't think they do, but they're watching all the time.
[01:27:15.584 --> 01:27:18.648]  When you get too close, they'll make sure that they try to stop you.
[01:27:18.929 --> 01:27:20.470]  Alex is a trooper.
[01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:22.753]  He's one of the strong ones out there.
[01:27:22.853 --> 01:27:28.780]  If anyone doubts that the Bilderberg Group is powerful, that they can pull strings such as this, that they can...
[01:27:29.381 --> 01:27:32.902]  Take over a mostly entire city or even an entire country.
[01:27:33.182 --> 01:27:35.043]  You just have to look at this story.
[01:27:35.063 --> 01:27:42.525]  And I've heard at least some people comment that Alex shouldn't have announced that he was going up there and that's, you know, maybe why he got caught.
[01:27:42.545 --> 01:27:50.107]  Well, listen, the best thing you can do when you're going into the lion's den is to let other people know you're going into the lion's den in case anything happens to you.
[01:27:50.368 --> 01:27:52.988]  You don't end up in Poland somewhere and no one ever sees you again.
[01:27:53.048 --> 01:27:54.709]  So, very important information.
[01:27:55.149 --> 01:28:04.125]  When you're in the public eye and you're doing what Alex and I and what you do, Rick, and others, that we keep people abreast of what we're doing so that they can cover our butts.
[01:28:04.205 --> 01:28:04.726]  You know what I mean?
[01:28:04.926 --> 01:28:08.653]  They still sneak in anything they can on the side to make you crippled up.
[01:28:09.153 --> 01:28:10.314]  Yeah.
[01:28:10.414 --> 01:28:15.817]  I think Alex is really lucky that they didn't plant something on him, that they weren't that desperate or didn't go that far.
[01:28:15.857 --> 01:28:19.600]  But, of course, they're scared because Alex is bold and he'll stand up to them.
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:20.940]  Adam, thank you for the call.
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:27.825]  We're going to come back to Joe, Betsy, Donna, John, everybody holding Alex Jones Show, prisonplanet.com, infowars.com.
[01:28:27.845 --> 01:28:28.245]  Stay tuned.

[01:29:54.511 --> 01:29:55.131]  Hello, folks.
[01:29:55.211 --> 01:29:56.152]  Alex Jones here.
[01:29:56.272 --> 01:30:00.354]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:30:00.494 --> 01:30:03.375]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:03.455 --> 01:30:10.179]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:10.359 --> 01:30:13.360]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:13.580 --> 01:30:15.942]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:16.082 --> 01:30:20.804]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove...
[01:30:21.024 --> 01:30:21.845]  We're good to go.
[01:30:45.399 --> 01:30:45.779]  803-4438 That's 888-803-4438
[01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:57.872]  We understand that decisions related to health can be overwhelming.
[01:30:58.152 --> 01:31:04.935]  That is why at ResearchedHerbs.com we take pride in offering you herbs whose safety and effectiveness have been proven time and time again.
[01:31:05.375 --> 01:31:18.742]  For example, did you know that Live52, the top-selling natural herbal supplement for liver diseases since 1930, is backed by over 300 research studies and clinical trials and prescribed by more than 200,000 health professionals worldwide?
[01:31:19.062 --> 01:31:22.804]  In fact, the effectiveness of all the herbs featured on ResearchedHerbs.com
[01:31:23.134 --> 01:31:24.175]  We're good to go.
[01:31:58.869 --> 01:32:00.772]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:32:01.272 --> 01:32:04.016]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:47.382 --> 01:32:55.504]  Well, Gripping Interview, just when you think there isn't any more evidence about 9-11, new videos come out, new information comes out, new experts come out.
[01:32:56.185 --> 01:33:02.446]  And an interesting question was just raised here at the InfoWars studio, and I want to direct that to Richard Siegel before we go back to the calls.
[01:33:02.847 --> 01:33:12.449]  Richard, let's just say, let's just give the Bush administration, the government, the murderers and liars that pose as our policy makers the benefit of the doubt.
[01:33:12.469 --> 01:33:14.390]  I know my listeners are cringing right now.
[01:33:14.930 --> 01:33:18.493]  But let's just go here for a minute to try to use some logic and common sense.
[01:33:18.773 --> 01:33:40.892]  The question is, if the dangerous material that just happened to be in the World Trade Center towers is what reality brought those towers down along with the airplane, wouldn't the government be working to find this material in other buildings around the country, around the world, looking to eradicate that dangerous material they say brought these buildings down and pancaked the buildings to make people safer?
[01:33:42.396 --> 01:33:43.857]  That's not their goal anyway.
[01:33:43.877 --> 01:33:44.937]  There was nothing to do.
[01:33:45.237 --> 01:33:47.498]  I understand that, but play along with me if you can.
[01:33:47.538 --> 01:33:52.000]  Again, this just shoots a giant hole through their story and their conspiracy theories.
[01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:52.500]  It's O.J.
[01:33:52.620 --> 01:33:54.100]  Simpson trying to look for his killer.
[01:33:55.961 --> 01:33:56.821]  Good analogy.
[01:33:57.041 --> 01:33:57.822]  I really like that.
[01:33:57.842 --> 01:33:58.902]  Let's get on with it.
[01:33:59.302 --> 01:34:03.564]  Of course, this question actually was posed initially by...
[01:34:04.464 --> 01:34:05.765]  He used some of it.
[01:34:05.785 --> 01:34:12.107]  I know they have before and I don't know what he's doing with it now because we didn't get a chance to talk with him too much in Chicago and hopefully we will out in Los Angeles.
[01:34:33.027 --> 01:34:42.312]  You know, like I said, if we can't go into this extreme scientific arena, we're never going to be able to make a good case about what really did happen on 9-11.
[01:34:42.392 --> 01:34:47.854]  And lucky for us, you were there on the ground with your video camera, and now you've made that available to all of us.
[01:34:47.894 --> 01:34:54.077]  Again, the video is 9-11 Eyewitness, the Hoboken video by Richard Siegel, 911eyewitness.com.
[01:34:54.137 --> 01:35:00.260]  And you're going to want to see Richard speak along with Stephen Jones and others at the 9-11 conference held by Alex Jones.
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:01.341]  You can get your tickets now.
[01:35:01.721 --> 01:35:03.283]  At InfoWars.com.
[01:35:03.303 --> 01:35:05.104]  That's June 24th and 25th.
[01:35:05.124 --> 01:35:09.448]  You better get off your butts and get ready and go right now or you're going to miss the opportunity.
[01:35:09.468 --> 01:35:10.409]  You're going to kick yourself.
[01:35:10.469 --> 01:35:12.691]  I said it over and over again because I know the feeling.
[01:35:12.711 --> 01:35:13.532]  I was kicking myself.
[01:35:13.572 --> 01:35:14.753]  I couldn't make it to Chicago.
[01:35:15.073 --> 01:35:16.514]  I'm not going to let that happen again.
[01:35:16.915 --> 01:35:18.756]  Rick, let's just go back to the phone calls here.
[01:35:18.776 --> 01:35:20.918]  We've got Joe in Kansas patiently holding.
[01:35:20.978 --> 01:35:21.759]  Joe, thank you.
[01:35:21.879 --> 01:35:23.341]  You're on the Alex Jones program.
[01:35:23.681 --> 01:35:23.881]  Hi.
[01:35:23.921 --> 01:35:24.321]  Can you hear me?
[01:35:24.522 --> 01:35:24.822]  Yes, sir.
[01:35:25.603 --> 01:35:27.104]  I've got a great guest on there.
[01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:38.304]  This is a good reason for people to back up their material at their own sites and also to disseminate information as quickly as you can because you may not have it tomorrow.
[01:35:39.444 --> 01:35:48.107]  But I had a few points I wanted to bring out actually a couple days ago, maybe yesterday, when Alex Jones was talking about the eminent domain stuff.
[01:35:48.127 --> 01:35:49.508]  Can you hear me?
[01:35:49.728 --> 01:35:50.288]  Yes.
[01:35:50.328 --> 01:35:52.489]  We did a big show on eminent domain yesterday.
[01:35:52.809 --> 01:35:53.029]  Right.
[01:35:54.573 --> 01:36:08.978]  One thing that we need to do among ourselves is explain to people who are these companies that are involved, who are profiting from the stealing of our land, and tell people so that they can just not participate in their commerce.
[01:36:09.628 --> 01:36:13.171]  That's a simple solution, and I suggested that yesterday with our guest.
[01:36:14.052 --> 01:36:15.693]  Look, we're waiting to vote.
[01:36:15.733 --> 01:36:23.200]  Of course, we now know that our votes are being stolen through electronic voting machine and some old school methods such as taking voters off the rolls, etc., etc.
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:27.403]  But if we vote with our dollars, we generally see that we can get results.
[01:36:28.244 --> 01:36:29.525]  Right, and we need to extend this.
[01:36:29.825 --> 01:36:36.151]  We know that the majority of the big corporations are involved in things like this, Kodak and IBM and
[01:36:36.641 --> 01:36:42.447]  You know, all these huge companies, if it's a huge company, you can be pretty sure they're involved.
[01:36:42.907 --> 01:36:47.172]  And we just need to stop taking all of our money to any of these people.
[01:36:47.651 --> 01:36:47.831]  Yeah.
[01:36:48.211 --> 01:36:49.672]  Well, that's very logical.
[01:36:49.772 --> 01:36:54.956]  I guess the question is, how do we get everybody to do that all together at one time?
[01:36:54.976 --> 01:37:00.980]  Every boycott I've ever seen, including the May Day boycott by the illegal aliens, has always failed.
[01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:03.862]  But, again, look, you'll hurt these people.
[01:37:04.142 --> 01:37:08.585]  You know, you look at these corporate farmers who put farmers out of business, like Tyson Chicken.
[01:37:09.065 --> 01:37:09.685]  Conagra.
[01:37:09.985 --> 01:37:18.047]  If you just didn't buy Tyson chicken, then they would start feeling the pain and they would either go out of business or have to start complying with the people's wishes.
[01:37:18.067 --> 01:37:22.708]  You know, I haven't shopped at Walmart or eaten at McDonald's for probably four or five years now.
[01:37:22.968 --> 01:37:27.850]  Yes, I pay a little bit more to go to the mom and pop store to keep them in business because guess what?
[01:37:28.130 --> 01:37:29.290]  They like my business.
[01:37:29.330 --> 01:37:30.450]  They know me by name.
[01:37:30.490 --> 01:37:33.291]  In fact, there's a little store over by my house where they keep...
[01:37:34.051 --> 01:37:34.692]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:37:48.348 --> 01:38:02.531]  Well, that's what Aaron Russo's new film, From Freedom to Fascism, is all about, and it's about that there is no law to pay your taxes, and you've got to turn your back on this beast, because you're just a big corporation.
[01:38:02.551 --> 01:38:06.392]  Your corporation goes all the way up to your government, and your government can't be corporate.
[01:38:07.152 --> 01:38:10.332]  How can a responsible government still be a corporation with immunity?
[01:38:10.993 --> 01:38:11.973]  It just can't be.
[01:38:12.013 --> 01:38:13.273]  It doesn't stand for logic.
[01:38:13.293 --> 01:38:13.373]  Sure.
[01:38:14.196 --> 01:38:30.924]  Well, and then if you get into James Traficant's speech to Congress, it was put on the Congressional record before they framed and locked him up, and he talked about how in 1933, and then of course after the Second World War, that we declared bankruptcy, and that is when democracy became the buzzword.
[01:38:30.964 --> 01:38:33.985]  Democracy really means corporate privatization.
[01:38:34.645 --> 01:38:39.388]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:38:39.688 --> 01:38:42.290]  Which unfortunately supersedes the Constitution in their eyes.
[01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:45.151]  Yeah, so that's why the President's right when he says that.
[01:38:45.251 --> 01:38:45.992]  It's a piece of paper.
[01:38:46.411 --> 01:38:47.612]  What are you worried about?
[01:38:47.652 --> 01:38:49.553]  We've got to make that paper mean something again.
[01:38:50.033 --> 01:38:56.217]  Yeah, I've been writing James Traficant, and I've got a little bit of a word I'm going to try to pass along to people here in the very near future.
[01:38:56.317 --> 01:39:00.399]  Very interesting guy, really paying the price for putting something on the record there.
[01:39:00.419 --> 01:39:01.440]  Yeah, sure.
[01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:14.228]  Folks, we accidentally elect an honest politician who's there actually to do our business and to expose the corruption and to expose this endgame in Washington, D.C., and they end up in jail.
[01:39:14.808 --> 01:39:15.749]  What a coincidence.
[01:39:16.049 --> 01:39:17.009]  Thanks for the call, Joe.
[01:39:17.070 --> 01:39:18.230]  Betsy in Florida.
[01:39:18.370 --> 01:39:19.551]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:39:21.252 --> 01:39:21.772]  Hi, Jack.
[01:39:22.533 --> 01:39:22.853]  Hello.
[01:39:22.873 --> 01:39:24.734]  Hello.
[01:39:24.934 --> 01:39:25.775]  You're on the air, Betsy.
[01:39:25.975 --> 01:39:26.375]  Hi.
[01:39:27.656 --> 01:39:28.797]  It's good to speak to you.
[01:39:29.097 --> 01:39:34.480]  And I wanted to tell Mr. Siegel that I watched his film.
[01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:35.561]  I was fascinated.
[01:39:35.581 --> 01:39:39.003]  I have seen many, many documentaries done on September 11th.
[01:39:39.063 --> 01:39:39.923]  Thank you.
[01:39:39.943 --> 01:39:41.624]  I've done a lot of research on it, yes.
[01:39:42.465 --> 01:39:44.226]  And the part that
[01:39:44.656 --> 01:39:51.339]  What really, really affected me was when the helicopters, when you zeroed in on them.
[01:39:51.419 --> 01:39:55.862]  In fact, even before that, I noticed little flashes under the helicopters.
[01:39:56.502 --> 01:39:59.463]  Can you explain what you think that really was?
[01:39:59.483 --> 01:40:02.225]  A lot of people have controversy over those.
[01:40:02.265 --> 01:40:03.585]  We're not sure.
[01:40:03.725 --> 01:40:05.686]  In the naked eye, we never saw any flashes.
[01:40:05.726 --> 01:40:08.708]  The camera saw these flashes, so we think they're infrared.
[01:40:09.332 --> 01:40:14.439]  What infrared was doing on there and what they were doing with it is still going to be speculation.
[01:40:14.479 --> 01:40:16.221]  We haven't come to real conclusions.
[01:40:16.862 --> 01:40:26.214]  The speculations are anything from trigger mechanisms to watching where the people are with cameras for later results of what they want to cover up.
[01:40:27.075 --> 01:40:38.940]  Richard, one of the things we've got to be careful of here, because this is radio and people are trying to use their imaginations to understand what we're saying here, trying to interpret words only with no footage to really look at.
[01:40:39.180 --> 01:40:40.480]  Maybe people haven't seen the film.
[01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:43.462]  We have to be very clear about what we're talking about.
[01:40:43.542 --> 01:40:49.644]  So when Betsy asks about the helicopters, is she talking about the helicopter rescue on the roof of the South Tower that you
[01:40:50.064 --> 01:40:53.045]  Yeah, it looked like there was going to be a rescue, and it didn't happen.
[01:40:53.065 --> 01:41:06.688]  There was a helicopter hovering really, really close, and this happened to only be five, six seconds before the south tower collapsed, the first collapse of a steel and cement building for no reason, or for very little reason.
[01:41:07.249 --> 01:41:16.831]  So I'm filming, doing the zoom, because I can see in my binoculars that people are hanging out the window of the towers and the helicopters hovering above,
[01:41:17.681 --> 01:41:19.864]  And the camera's picking up something else.
[01:41:20.504 --> 01:41:25.670]  And it picks up these flashes from them, and it picks up them going, and then the building falling.
[01:41:26.031 --> 01:41:28.253]  What do you assume the flashes were?
[01:41:28.293 --> 01:41:29.474]  Give us your analysis on that.
[01:41:29.695 --> 01:41:31.997]  That they were some sort of an infrared.
[01:41:32.117 --> 01:41:34.840]  The flashes are an infrared device of some sort.
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:34.960]  The...
[01:41:37.751 --> 01:41:43.076]  The helicopter was probably turning, and that's why we got the glimpse of the infrared as it panned across of us.
[01:41:43.597 --> 01:41:47.220]  Whether it was trying to pan across of us or it wasn't, we don't know.
[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:50.243]  Whether it was a trigger device or something.
[01:41:50.263 --> 01:41:53.386]  Well, that's what I want to know, is what would the infrared device be used for?
[01:41:53.686 --> 01:42:02.735]  Well, some of the scientists would think that this could be an infrared trigger device that can trigger it from the top, and that's what that would probably have been.
[01:42:03.448 --> 01:42:08.412]  So it would trigger the pre-planet explosives and alleged thermite in the building.
[01:42:08.832 --> 01:42:09.873]  Right, exactly.
[01:42:10.414 --> 01:42:18.380]  The timing was definitely there, and now he was hovering on the Hoboken side, which is the side that all the cameras weren't on.
[01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:23.464]  That was an important thing that they told me, was that you're at a point where no one had cameras.
[01:42:25.302 --> 01:42:31.404]  Well, and not only that, camera's powerful enough to zoom from Hoboken into Manhattan.
[01:42:31.845 --> 01:42:32.825]  Right, exactly.
[01:42:33.185 --> 01:42:34.085]  Betsy, anything else?
[01:42:34.525 --> 01:42:35.986]  Yes, I did have one other thing.
[01:42:36.686 --> 01:42:51.831]  Alex always tells us to become experts in one area, and one of the things that he has done is had passed in Austin and encouraged people in other cities to reaffirm the Bill of Rights.
[01:42:52.717 --> 01:42:58.880]  And to reject the USA Patriot Act and all the other unconstitutional federal legislation.
[01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:02.361]  So I've taken up that cause in my city.
[01:43:02.381 --> 01:43:03.802]  Good for you.
[01:43:03.842 --> 01:43:04.662]  Where do you live in Florida?
[01:43:05.662 --> 01:43:06.583]  I live in Callaway.
[01:43:07.543 --> 01:43:10.844]  And I'm also speaking at two other cities in the future.
[01:43:10.864 --> 01:43:16.607]  We're trying to get it a county-wide thing in all of Bay County and possibly the whole panhandle of Florida.
[01:43:17.767 --> 01:43:22.429]  I also started my own organization, which I thought I could just plug my website for
[01:43:23.235 --> 01:43:25.076]  It's called Citizens Guarding Freedom.
[01:43:26.658 --> 01:43:35.103]  And if people want to log into it, it is citizens-guarding.blogspot.com.
[01:43:35.523 --> 01:43:38.345]  Will you email that to me at jackblood at hotmail.com?
[01:43:38.385 --> 01:43:40.347]  Betsy, I'd like to find out more about it as well.
[01:43:40.407 --> 01:43:42.148]  I mean, isn't this the truth, Richard?
[01:43:42.188 --> 01:43:43.529]  We need more people doing this.
[01:43:43.569 --> 01:43:45.410]  We need more people being examples.
[01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:49.093]  We need more people getting out there and taking leadership roles in our community.
[01:43:49.113 --> 01:43:50.273]  Absolutely.
[01:43:50.293 --> 01:43:51.054]  That's how to do it.
[01:43:51.650 --> 01:43:55.892]  You know, get out there and do that and keep us all informed so we can pass it on.
[01:43:56.412 --> 01:43:57.712]  A very motivating call.
[01:43:57.752 --> 01:43:58.452]  Thank you, Betsy.
[01:43:58.472 --> 01:44:05.275]  We need to hear that on a Friday after the long week we've had in the beginning of the summer of quote-unquote fear here.
[01:44:05.335 --> 01:44:06.955]  That's exactly what we need to do.
[01:44:07.175 --> 01:44:08.776]  You know, and this is the thing, Richard.
[01:44:08.816 --> 01:44:11.537]  This is what we always hear is that, well, what can I do?
[01:44:11.657 --> 01:44:12.897]  I'm only one person.
[01:44:12.957 --> 01:44:17.359]  If I had a nickel for every time I heard that, I'd be as rich as Donald Rumsfeld at this point.
[01:44:18.499 --> 01:44:26.284]  The fact is, one person can do a lot, and we've proven that over and over again with people like Betsy, people like yourself, people like Alex Jones.
[01:44:26.304 --> 01:44:32.107]  Let's not forget, he's one person that's been able to reach millions and millions of people and help wake them up.
[01:44:32.167 --> 01:44:34.048]  So let's never get apathetic.
[01:44:34.088 --> 01:44:39.291]  Let's never get so cynical that we can't get out and do something to help save our country and the world at large.
[01:44:39.832 --> 01:44:40.372]  Absolutely.
[01:44:41.075 --> 01:44:42.677]  Let's go to Donna in Mass.
[01:44:42.737 --> 01:44:52.168]  Now, this is my friend Donna in Mass, who has been under just extreme circumstances, harassed by her government for many, many years now.
[01:44:52.469 --> 01:44:53.750]  I'd be most happy to speak to you.
[01:44:53.770 --> 01:44:54.311]  Is that you, Donna?
[01:44:54.873 --> 01:44:58.296]  Yes, it's me, Jack, and this is the second time I'm hearing you today.
[01:44:59.717 --> 01:45:01.038]  We haven't talked in a long time.
[01:45:01.078 --> 01:45:07.462]  I know you and your family listen to our radio network, our broadcast there in New England.
[01:45:07.823 --> 01:45:10.124]  Well, what's on your mind, and how have things been going for you?
[01:45:10.144 --> 01:45:11.265]  Did things straighten out for you?
[01:45:11.285 --> 01:45:21.413]  Oh, they did, but, you know, it's just proof positive to us that this state has plunged headlong into this police state mechanism.
[01:45:21.433 --> 01:45:22.013]  You know, there's just
[01:45:22.523 --> 01:45:23.203]  No question about it.
[01:45:23.223 --> 01:45:39.954]  Let me just quickly tell people that there was an alleged, and I know this family, folks, there was an alleged domestic violence report put on their family, and I want you all to understand that if any of your neighbors, I hate to think I'm giving somebody an idea here, but let's just be very plain and get the truth out.
[01:45:40.234 --> 01:45:51.981]  If anybody wants to go after you, all they have to do is claim that there's some domestic violence going on in your house, and that gives the police the right to supersede your Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights, kick down your door, come in,
[01:45:52.821 --> 01:45:56.182]  Donna, they ransacked your house.
[01:45:56.242 --> 01:45:58.603]  They kidnapped you and your children.
[01:45:59.083 --> 01:46:02.924]  Your children were further kidnapped by CPS, I think, later down the line.
[01:46:03.144 --> 01:46:08.105]  They took your rights to own firearms away, all on an alleged domestic violence charge.
[01:46:08.145 --> 01:46:12.166]  And you guys spent a long time, it was a long road, trying to fight that.
[01:46:12.466 --> 01:46:14.406]  I always felt so bad you had to go through that.
[01:46:15.207 --> 01:46:18.427]  The thing that hurts too, Jack, is my husband's a war hero.
[01:46:18.467 --> 01:46:21.228]  He's the winner of a Silver Star, a Brown Star award.
[01:46:22.938 --> 01:46:25.040]  So many citations and commendations.
[01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:28.222]  He's probably the most decorated man in the state.
[01:46:29.183 --> 01:46:33.266]  And I think that's partly the reason why they came and did the raid.
[01:46:34.047 --> 01:46:35.988]  But you say things are getting better for you now?
[01:46:36.008 --> 01:46:37.169]  Did you ever get your firearms back?
[01:46:38.727 --> 01:46:43.549]  No, but that's not to say that we don't have self-defense.
[01:46:43.929 --> 01:46:45.009]  You don't have to say any more.
[01:46:45.029 --> 01:46:47.010]  Well, Donna, I don't know if you called in about that.
[01:46:47.050 --> 01:46:48.410]  Did you call in about something else?
[01:46:48.431 --> 01:46:49.431]  Do you have a question for our guests?
[01:46:49.451 --> 01:46:53.412]  Well, I wanted to tell Rick that I did see his film.
[01:46:54.133 --> 01:46:56.673]  It's fantastic.
[01:46:57.954 --> 01:47:06.537]  That's a subject that's dear to my heart because I did work for an engineering firm on the 88th floor of the South Tower some years ago.
[01:47:07.719 --> 01:47:09.660]  It became Washington Group.
[01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:12.361]  Rick may know them, but I was in and out of those towers a lot.
[01:47:13.041 --> 01:47:14.541]  And that became a subject dear to my heart.
[01:47:14.581 --> 01:47:18.002]  But also, I've done metals testing over the years.
[01:47:18.062 --> 01:47:24.564]  The military trained me, but I've done metals testing on aircraft, and I went into structural steel.
[01:47:24.745 --> 01:47:29.006]  I now do the big steel coasters like at Six Flags and such.
[01:47:29.746 --> 01:47:35.688]  But I am convinced that those were thermite charges because I have witnessed...
[01:47:36.628 --> 01:47:39.390]  Thermal welding on railroad tracks.
[01:47:39.850 --> 01:47:52.358]  It produces the exact same smoke, and the temperature is indeed high enough to turn steel into a molten state.
[01:47:52.378 --> 01:47:53.499]  Have we been able... Go ahead, Donna.
[01:47:53.519 --> 01:47:53.699]  I'm sorry.
[01:47:53.719 --> 01:47:54.860]  You know, 4,500 to 5,000 degrees is enough to do that.
[01:47:54.900 --> 01:47:56.461]  And I talked to a colleague of mine who's been...
[01:48:04.656 --> 01:48:10.861]  Yeah, he was involved in this business of non-destructive testing for like 35 years and he said yes, that would do it.
[01:48:11.301 --> 01:48:15.465]  And other people, they were like, same thing.
[01:48:16.016 --> 01:48:18.578]  Yeah, that would do it.
[01:48:19.359 --> 01:48:38.417]  Richard, have we been able to compare, I'm not sure how you drop into the thermite theory here, but have we been able to compare how thermite is used in a commercial context as to what happened at the towers in 9-11, maybe using your footage or other footage to definitively say that thermite could have been used to bring down those towers?
[01:48:38.897 --> 01:48:51.910]  Yeah, we show maybe a half a dozen to a dozen other demolitions that are using the same RDX and RDX cordite and thermite cutting charges to cut the metal.
[01:48:52.671 --> 01:48:54.052]  And they work the same way.
[01:48:54.853 --> 01:49:00.399]  And even to the point we show when one building tilts over, how it continues to tilt over and falls over.
[01:49:02.314 --> 01:49:05.895]  So the comparative analysis on that is in your video.
[01:49:06.115 --> 01:49:08.096]  This is something that people can see for themselves.
[01:49:08.636 --> 01:49:17.898]  Again, I mean, when you say something as a theory, and then you have comparative analysis to back it up, along with a lot of exclusive video footage, it becomes a conspiracy fact.
[01:49:17.918 --> 01:49:18.618]  Does it not, Richard?
[01:49:18.878 --> 01:49:19.178]  Right.
[01:49:19.278 --> 01:49:21.659]  Yeah, that's why it's such a compelling movie.
[01:49:21.799 --> 01:49:26.040]  It's slow, it moves, but it goes, here it is, here it is.
[01:49:26.659 --> 01:49:28.841]  And you look at what this means.
[01:49:28.941 --> 01:49:29.582]  What is this?
[01:49:30.662 --> 01:49:33.124]  You know, we don't have to say it because you see it.
[01:49:33.565 --> 01:49:35.106]  Sister Donna, thank you for the call.
[01:49:35.166 --> 01:49:36.027]  So good to hear from you.
[01:49:36.067 --> 01:49:37.888]  Please give my best to your family, if you would.
[01:49:37.908 --> 01:49:39.029]  We'll take a quick break.
[01:49:39.049 --> 01:49:40.891]  We'll come back more with Richard Siegel.
[01:49:40.991 --> 01:49:43.133]  And your phone call is 800-259-9231.

[01:49:46.115 --> 01:49:47.856]  You're listening to GCN Radio Network.
[01:49:48.137 --> 01:49:48.757]  I'm Jack Blood.
[01:49:48.777 --> 01:49:49.177]  Stay tuned.
[01:49:53.965 --> 01:50:02.232]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[01:50:02.432 --> 01:50:04.754]  We're expecting around a thousand people in attendance.
[01:50:05.374 --> 01:50:14.222]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[01:50:14.742 --> 01:50:18.244]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda.
[01:50:18.684 --> 01:50:39.513]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Turnbull, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[01:50:39.813 --> 01:50:43.515]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[01:50:44.016 --> 01:50:45.239]  Arm yourself with the truth.
[01:50:45.620 --> 01:50:50.912]  Secure your tickets today at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:50:54.349 --> 01:50:54.990]  We're good to go.
[01:51:15.305 --> 01:51:21.347]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[01:51:21.547 --> 01:51:24.788]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[01:51:47.336 --> 01:51:48.876]  Call now and get free shipping.
[01:51:49.136 --> 01:51:51.937]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:51:52.117 --> 01:52:01.400]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:03.881]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:52:04.081 --> 01:52:10.423]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:52:10.763 --> 01:52:11.424]  We're good to go.
[01:52:40.282 --> 01:52:43.385]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:43.545 --> 01:52:49.410]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:53:57.717 --> 01:54:13.716]  Well, we are sending an SOS to the world with this broadcast.
[01:54:14.699 --> 01:54:19.861]  And it's up to you to put that message in a bottle, send it out, drop it off at your neighbor's house.
[01:54:20.122 --> 01:54:21.702]  You know, we like to go talk to our neighbors.
[01:54:22.283 --> 01:54:24.484]  It's crazy in this day and age, isn't it?
[01:54:24.524 --> 01:54:29.726]  We know our neighbors, we talk to our neighbors, we have a certain loyalty and allegiance to each other.
[01:54:30.912 --> 01:54:41.906]  And we've done some crazy stuff as well as making flyers and just going to mass parking lots and concerts and sporting events and flyering every car in the parking lot to get the information out.
[01:54:41.966 --> 01:54:43.808]  So you can get involved.
[01:54:43.848 --> 01:54:44.689]  You can do something.
[01:54:44.709 --> 01:54:46.251]  You don't have to have a big website.
[01:54:46.271 --> 01:54:47.853]  You don't have to make documentary films.
[01:54:47.873 --> 01:54:49.535]  You don't have to have a radio program.
[01:54:50.115 --> 01:54:56.760]  Newsletters, you can do all of that, but there's little things that we can all do to help spread the message and keep the momentum going.
[01:54:57.080 --> 01:55:03.385]  This 9-11 truth movement, in my opinion, is a giant snowball rolling downhill.
[01:55:03.425 --> 01:55:13.773]  Now, one of the reasons why is a lot of people like my man, Alex Jones, whose chair I sit in right now, has dedicated himself countless hours a day, seven days a week,
[01:55:14.708 --> 01:55:18.772]  Every day of the month, every month of the year, to getting out information.
[01:55:19.072 --> 01:55:26.839]  Right now, in the studio I'm working on, they're putting together the new Alex Jones film, Terror Storm, and it is just absolutely amazing.
[01:55:26.879 --> 01:55:29.222]  You people are going to be blown away by that.
[01:55:29.242 --> 01:55:34.847]  But right now, Martial Law 9-11, Rise of the Police State, is still one of the best videos out there.
[01:55:35.307 --> 01:55:37.689]  Really gets people up to speed.
[01:55:37.729 --> 01:55:39.191]  Gives them a history lesson.
[01:55:39.631 --> 01:55:42.054]  It fills in a lot of the blanks.
[01:55:42.074 --> 01:55:48.520]  It gives you examples of how exactly, as the great Bill Hicks once said, all governments are murderers and liars.
[01:55:48.860 --> 01:55:50.602]  It proves that beyond a shadow of a doubt.
[01:55:50.862 --> 01:55:52.684]  Why we shouldn't trust our government.
[01:55:52.924 --> 01:55:55.727]  Why we shouldn't count on our government to protect us.
[01:55:56.148 --> 01:56:01.333]  How security, in general, is an illusion that is sold to us as a control mechanism.
[01:56:02.023 --> 01:56:04.486]  All in martial law, 9-11, rise of the police state.
[01:56:04.506 --> 01:56:06.448]  I have a small cameo in this myself.
[01:56:06.888 --> 01:56:19.402]  Also shows you what happened during the Republican National Coronation, as we like to call it, on the streets there, and the massive police state that was put together as a show of force to people around the world.
[01:56:20.434 --> 01:56:29.216]  Martial Law, a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media, really crashing through the lies and the disinformation.
[01:56:29.516 --> 01:56:33.076]  Great film, of course, Dark Secrets, Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:56:33.516 --> 01:56:36.357]  All of the Alex Jones films, extremely educational.
[01:56:36.577 --> 01:56:42.078]  You are authorized to copy those videos for educational purposes to get the word out.
[01:56:42.098 --> 01:56:43.498]  This makes it very simple for you.
[01:56:43.718 --> 01:56:45.099]  You don't have to memorize anything.
[01:56:45.139 --> 01:56:47.579]  You don't have to practice a speech to your loved ones.
[01:56:47.799 --> 01:56:48.580]  We're good to go.
[01:56:48.660 --> 01:56:49.280]  We're good to go.
[01:57:11.508 --> 01:57:18.909]  888-253-3139, and you should consider as an economical value joining Prison Planet TV right now, prisonplanet.com.
[01:57:19.169 --> 01:57:27.911]  We'll come right back more with our guest today, Richard Siegel, talking about his video, 9-11 Eyewitness, the Hoboken video, very interesting stuff, and we'll go right back to the phone.
[01:57:27.951 --> 01:57:28.371]  Stay tuned.
[01:57:28.391 --> 01:57:31.552]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show, GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:33.695 --> 01:57:38.316]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:38.356 --> 01:57:38.836]  Big Brother.
[01:57:39.016 --> 01:57:39.797]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:39.817 --> 01:57:42.897]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:45.678 --> 01:57:47.819]  You want answers?
[01:57:48.119 --> 01:57:49.579]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.363 --> 01:58:02.086]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.546 --> 01:58:06.629]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.811 --> 01:58:10.731]  We are live.
[01:58:11.031 --> 01:58:13.413]  It is Friday, June 9th, 2006.
[01:58:15.578 --> 01:58:22.663]  Alex Jones is on assignment in the foreign nation known as Canada covering the Bilderberg Conference in Ottawa, Canada.
[01:58:22.943 --> 01:58:24.704]  We are still hoping for Alex to call in.
[01:58:24.924 --> 01:58:27.646]  Guys listening in the other room, check on that for us.
[01:58:27.666 --> 01:58:30.628]  I know people are really anxious to hear an update from Alex.
[01:58:30.968 --> 01:58:34.630]  If we can get him to call in for just a few minutes and let us know what's going on up there.
[01:58:35.971 --> 01:58:38.012]  I hope it's not a bad sign that he's not calling in.
[01:58:38.053 --> 01:58:39.173]  I hope he's okay.
[01:58:39.193 --> 01:58:42.976]  I think that's the first thing we consider when we don't hear from Alex.
[01:58:43.036 --> 01:58:51.681]  But he also could just be knee-deep or neck-deep in information, catching a lot of footage and a lot of information that you won't be able to see anywhere else.
[01:58:51.721 --> 01:58:55.824]  And I know that he's going to be very happy to share that with you when and if he comes back.
[01:58:56.822 --> 01:58:59.424]  I hate to think that I might be hosting this show again.
[01:58:59.984 --> 01:59:05.027]  Anyway, I love doing it, but honestly, we all appreciate Alex Jones' commentary.
[01:59:05.047 --> 01:59:09.589]  We all want him back on Monday safe and sound, and we'll again look for an update from Alex Jones.
[01:59:09.629 --> 01:59:11.830]  Our guest today is Richard Siegel.
[01:59:12.110 --> 01:59:14.512]  His video, again, is 9-11 Eyewitness Hoboken.
[01:59:14.552 --> 01:59:16.673]  Everybody is raving about this film.
[01:59:16.973 --> 01:59:19.634]  It is one of the best new entrances into the
[01:59:21.215 --> 01:59:21.735]  No problem.
[01:59:22.035 --> 01:59:22.715]  Thank you.
[01:59:22.735 --> 01:59:24.916]  Have you gotten any information about that while being there?
[01:59:48.883 --> 01:59:52.706]  The Madrid bombings, well, we think they're all engineered anyway.
[01:59:52.726 --> 01:59:56.168]  It brought them all into a police state here, too.
[01:59:56.228 --> 01:59:57.929]  They're selling the terrorism here.
[01:59:57.969 --> 01:59:59.610]  They've got the chips in the arms already.
[01:59:59.630 --> 02:00:00.931]  The kids already want them.
[02:00:02.692 --> 02:00:12.718]  You know, we were covering that, and interestingly enough, my webmaster at the time was fluent in Spanish, and he just took it as a practice to read Spanish newspapers.
[02:00:13.390 --> 02:00:13.750]  Right, exactly.
[02:00:13.770 --> 02:00:14.950]  Plus, they were using the demolition...
[02:00:43.296 --> 02:00:44.977]  Right.
[02:00:45.097 --> 02:00:57.659]  And then also, it was in Spain where the great analysis, and this again gets back into your video here, where a skyscraper burned for, what was it, about 24 hours?
[02:00:58.659 --> 02:00:59.260]  17 hours it was.
[02:00:59.360 --> 02:00:59.960]  Full blaze.
[02:00:59.980 --> 02:01:04.901]  This wasn't like the little... If you see our new video, you see the girl dancing in the hall.
[02:01:04.941 --> 02:01:06.541]  There was no heat coming out of there, but...
[02:01:07.065 --> 02:01:07.365]  Right.
[02:01:20.448 --> 02:01:28.072]  Well, you know, this is funny because this is one of the cover stories, one of the conspiracy theories put out by the government and their minions.
[02:01:28.632 --> 02:01:32.174]  And I've had a lot of neocon guests on my program tell me just this.
[02:01:32.194 --> 02:01:34.995]  Well, Jack, you know, they just don't make buildings like they used to.
[02:01:35.055 --> 02:01:41.558]  And they just didn't do a good job making the World Trade Center building two of the tallest skyscrapers in the world in the modern technology era.
[02:01:42.359 --> 02:01:42.519]  Right.
[02:01:43.219 --> 02:01:45.502]  I mean, are they making high-rises out of cardboard now?
[02:01:45.562 --> 02:01:47.023]  Is that what's going on here?
[02:01:47.043 --> 02:01:47.143]  Right.
[02:02:05.131 --> 02:02:09.415]  I don't think it was anything near like... Could there be more of a ridiculous excuse here?
[02:02:09.435 --> 02:02:19.423]  It's almost as bad as, you know, when it was proven beyond a shadow of a doubt, this is about two years ago, that there's no way a plane, even full of jet fuel, could have brought down that building.
[02:02:19.643 --> 02:02:23.946]  They begin saying that the paper and the office machines brought down the building.
[02:02:24.006 --> 02:02:28.049]  That was what made the fires hot enough to create the alleged pancake theory.
[02:02:28.069 --> 02:02:29.371]  I want to come back, talk about Building 7.
[02:02:30.071 --> 02:02:31.113]  We'll take some more calls.
[02:02:31.133 --> 02:02:32.474]  We're with Richard Siegel today.
[02:02:32.494 --> 02:02:34.357]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.

[02:02:35.438 --> 02:02:35.819]  Stay tuned.
[02:02:46.041 --> 02:02:54.303]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here, and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[02:02:54.483 --> 02:02:56.824]  We're expecting around 1,000 people in attendance.
[02:02:57.424 --> 02:03:06.267]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[02:03:06.787 --> 02:03:10.310]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda.
[02:03:10.750 --> 02:03:31.588]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Tarpley, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[02:03:31.888 --> 02:03:35.631]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.

[02:03:46.300 --> 02:03:57.029]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:03:57.209 --> 02:04:04.775]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:04:04.995 --> 02:04:05.796]  We're good to go.
[02:04:20.976 --> 02:04:24.878]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:04:24.918 --> 02:04:26.800]  The water level is always visible.
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:32.943]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.

[02:04:47.617 --> 02:04:50.199]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:04:50.339 --> 02:04:52.521]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:04:52.781 --> 02:05:02.890]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[02:05:03.190 --> 02:05:05.532]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.
[02:05:05.692 --> 02:05:09.795]  There's a 100% unconditional guarantee on all their wonderful products.
[02:05:09.996 --> 02:05:16.120]  They're all natural, they're triple concentrated, they're factory direct, factory owned and operated since 1947.

[02:06:03.595 --> 02:06:05.297]  We've just gotten a message from Alex Jones.
[02:06:05.337 --> 02:06:13.065]  He should be calling in here in just about 22 minutes to give us a full and complete update on what's going on there in Ottawa, Canada.
[02:06:13.085 --> 02:06:14.987]  He's covering the Bilderberg Conference.
[02:06:15.007 --> 02:06:16.008]  Of course, that's why I'm sitting in.
[02:06:16.028 --> 02:06:16.629]  I'm Jack Blood.
[02:06:17.049 --> 02:06:18.551]  JackBlood.com.
[02:06:19.264 --> 02:06:20.805]  We need your support as well.
[02:06:20.905 --> 02:06:23.266]  Please do whatever you can to help us.
[02:06:23.326 --> 02:06:34.450]  We are making a lot of sacrifices over about five, six years now to really do our best to get out information in an unbiased fashion so that you, again, can come to your own conclusion.
[02:06:34.490 --> 02:06:36.190]  That's what this is all about.
[02:06:36.450 --> 02:06:42.492]  We're also going to try to play that Ann Coulter-Keith-Oberman clip in the last half hour of the program, and we're taking your calls at 800-259-8000.
[02:06:45.214 --> 02:06:45.294]  92-31.
[02:06:45.354 --> 02:06:47.335]  Richard, I've got about another segment or two with you.
[02:06:47.395 --> 02:06:49.056]  I appreciate you staying all this time.
[02:06:49.496 --> 02:06:51.357]  It's important that people get this information.
[02:06:51.377 --> 02:06:53.559]  And again, I know you like what you're hearing.
[02:06:53.579 --> 02:07:00.283]  You're going to want to see Richard Siegel at the 9-11 Truth Conference in Los Angeles in just about two weeks.
[02:07:00.363 --> 02:07:01.504]  Tickets are still available.
[02:07:01.524 --> 02:07:04.205]  They're going very fast at InfoWars.com.
[02:07:04.245 --> 02:07:05.346]  InfoWars.com.
[02:07:05.366 --> 02:07:06.567]  And, of course, you can always call in at 888-253-7000.
[02:07:09.148 --> 02:07:10.409]  Well, it's just such a blatant...
[02:07:37.469 --> 02:07:37.809]  I'm a lazy guy.
[02:07:37.829 --> 02:07:42.393]  I would not pack my cameras up to go down and film this after I filmed the other two and was in shock and awe myself.
[02:07:42.413 --> 02:07:44.754]  So here I was waiting for that... It's okay.
[02:07:44.774 --> 02:07:46.075]  I was waiting for that...
[02:08:06.874 --> 02:08:13.160]  For that building to come down with my camera, and finally it did, and it has every mark of demolition.
[02:08:13.240 --> 02:08:16.803]  So you anticipated Building 7 falling, even though none of us really did?
[02:08:17.704 --> 02:08:18.945]  It was announced on the radio.
[02:08:19.626 --> 02:08:22.969]  They told us on the radio, that building's going to come down, so I had to film it.
[02:08:23.009 --> 02:08:27.473]  I was on live TV, and if I had to, I had to get every building that was coming down, so...
[02:08:28.033 --> 02:08:32.996]  I trucked all the stuff out to go and grab it because I was told on the radio that that building was coming down.
[02:08:33.016 --> 02:08:39.659]  Do you have any analysis or any idea as to why they would bring down Building 7 other than the fact that it was owned by Silverstein?
[02:08:39.980 --> 02:08:41.741]  Well, it was more than a Silverstein building.
[02:08:41.781 --> 02:08:46.123]  This was the headquarters for Giuliani and his complete control center for the whole city.
[02:08:46.183 --> 02:08:53.427]  All the fiber optics into the building and the SEC was in there, the FBI, the CIA, only the most secret organizations.
[02:08:54.139 --> 02:09:04.625]  This was the control center where they probably set off all the timed explosives and we think that was supposed to go down with the North Tower and didn't go because it was a dud.
[02:09:05.306 --> 02:09:10.789]  So that's because they would have loved to have that go during all that smoke so that no one would see what...
[02:09:12.552 --> 02:09:20.775]  I agree with your analysis here that this was the command and control center of the New York City event here on 9-11.
[02:09:20.995 --> 02:09:22.476]  How did they think they were going to get away with it?
[02:09:22.496 --> 02:09:24.157]  I mean, there was no fires really in it.
[02:09:24.197 --> 02:09:25.317]  No planes really hit it.
[02:09:25.357 --> 02:09:26.858]  How did they think they were going to get away with it?
[02:09:26.898 --> 02:09:30.139]  And have you ever heard them really explain how that building fell?
[02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:32.881]  It had to go down because of what it was.
[02:09:33.001 --> 02:09:38.003]  So once it didn't go down in its proper time frame, they had to take the huge risk.
[02:09:38.587 --> 02:09:41.728]  So, and the risk is just that this building is complete insanity.
[02:09:41.788 --> 02:09:46.911]  Any idiot looks at that, and you've got to be a total idiot to think that that building fell.
[02:09:47.391 --> 02:09:51.653]  I think Jones once said, like, well, maybe it was embarrassed by seeing the other two fall.
[02:09:51.733 --> 02:09:54.794]  It says, well, maybe I've got to fall, too.
[02:09:54.994 --> 02:09:55.855]  They were big guys.
[02:09:55.955 --> 02:09:59.496]  I should just fall from, you know, being obsolete, you know, only 42 stories.
[02:10:01.334 --> 02:10:03.015]  Well, let me play the devil's advocate here.
[02:10:03.135 --> 02:10:14.122]  One of the excuses, I guess I have heard, though not very publicly, is that there was a lot of reserve fuel in the building that somehow caught fire and brought the building down.
[02:10:14.142 --> 02:10:24.748]  But to me, that would signify a giant explosion which could not be contained in a direct fall, gravity-expanding, gravity-beating freefall of the building.
[02:10:24.768 --> 02:10:28.270]  There would be explosives shooting out one side, out the other side.
[02:10:28.290 --> 02:10:29.391]  It would be pretty obvious...
[02:10:29.711 --> 02:10:32.292]  That the gasoline stored in the building caught fire.
[02:10:32.552 --> 02:10:33.593]  And it would be chaotic.
[02:10:33.653 --> 02:10:36.514]  It wouldn't be as... Yeah.
[02:10:36.534 --> 02:10:39.075]  It wouldn't have the same eyewitness reports that we had.
[02:10:39.095 --> 02:10:42.017]  I mean, I had stuff coming on the radio, and it was in real time.
[02:10:42.077 --> 02:10:47.159]  There was no editing, and these people were reporting all the bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, all the way up.
[02:10:47.680 --> 02:10:50.041]  The police and fire department were saying the same thing.
[02:10:50.101 --> 02:10:53.983]  And there's the video that says, wow, here's... This is what they're saying.
[02:10:54.023 --> 02:10:54.823]  Here's the video.
[02:10:55.495 --> 02:11:00.159]  You know, even like when we get to the seismic data, it's like, wow, that matches up with each one of these explosions.
[02:11:00.219 --> 02:11:07.005]  Well, you can tell stories all day around, but then, like you said, you've got that Occam's Razor.
[02:11:07.486 --> 02:11:08.667]  This is the obvious one.
[02:11:08.687 --> 02:11:14.652]  It's just there on Building 7 was the most obnoxious of them all, and it had to come down.
[02:11:14.672 --> 02:11:16.153]  And only one person died in there.
[02:11:16.233 --> 02:11:20.457]  Now, if they evacuated everybody, why did that secret agent die?
[02:11:21.323 --> 02:11:26.508]  We think he gave up his life, didn't know it, but he was just supposed to connect the wire that was broken.
[02:11:26.828 --> 02:11:27.349]  John O'Neill?
[02:11:27.709 --> 02:11:28.030]  Yeah.
[02:11:28.450 --> 02:11:35.657]  His first day of work after he had to quit the FBI because they wouldn't listen to him warning about this so-called event coming.
[02:11:35.857 --> 02:11:38.059]  First day of work at the World Trade Center, dead.
[02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:38.920]  Right.
[02:11:39.921 --> 02:11:42.824]  And I was in charge of the security there that day anyways.
[02:11:43.841 --> 02:11:46.224]  I believe his initials were MB.
[02:11:46.244 --> 02:11:50.249]  It's amazing how this family is everywhere.
[02:11:50.790 --> 02:11:51.711]  It certainly is.
[02:11:51.731 --> 02:11:54.054]  He wins his election by his brother.
[02:11:54.094 --> 02:11:55.195]  The other one wins this.
[02:11:56.224 --> 02:12:02.689]  Well, and then we have the Hinckley assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan as well, which also involves Neil Bush.
[02:12:02.709 --> 02:12:06.992]  We have the Silverado massive banking scandal that Neil got away with.
[02:12:07.613 --> 02:12:13.257]  Right now, I believe Neil Bush is involved with, I think, the United Arab Emirates.
[02:12:13.397 --> 02:12:21.343]  Of course, that makes sense to everyone, along with Barbara Bush as an investor to put out educational software for our children, to program our children.
[02:12:21.643 --> 02:12:22.404]  They are everywhere.
[02:12:22.744 --> 02:12:23.845]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[02:12:23.965 --> 02:12:24.686]  They're everywhere.
[02:12:24.706 --> 02:12:30.910]  And then, of course, the Bankers Trust Building, which wasn't owned by Silverstein, managed right next to the World Trade Center building to not fall at all.
[02:12:30.970 --> 02:12:31.650]  Nothing happened to that.
[02:12:32.070 --> 02:12:32.731]  Absolutely.
[02:12:33.091 --> 02:12:34.132]  Neither did the post office.
[02:12:34.172 --> 02:12:36.073]  Not a scratch on that.
[02:12:36.293 --> 02:12:37.754]  Do you think we're ever going to find out?
[02:12:38.055 --> 02:12:40.056]  Is this ever going to be revealed to the public?
[02:12:40.096 --> 02:12:42.898]  Is anyone ever going to be held responsible for this?
[02:12:43.498 --> 02:12:45.079]  Because I really haven't seen that happen yet.
[02:12:45.099 --> 02:12:49.462]  Do you believe that we'll ever get disclosure on this, or will this go the way of JFK?
[02:12:50.403 --> 02:12:52.124]  If we can take back our republic...
[02:12:52.492 --> 02:13:03.261]  Which is what Alex is pushing for, because we're not just pushing for little glitches in their plans, which 9-11 was just one incident of everything they do every day, this corporate dictatorship.
[02:13:03.301 --> 02:13:12.329]  So it's like if people can wake up to the whole thing and go, my God, these guys are getting away with murder, then we might be able to do that.
[02:13:12.870 --> 02:13:19.015]  But if we play in their ballpark and their games with their laws and their rules that they've already implanted into us, then...
[02:13:19.611 --> 02:13:21.432]  You know, we don't know the law.
[02:13:21.452 --> 02:13:22.473]  We'll end up losing this.
[02:13:22.513 --> 02:13:31.617]  I mean, as much as we'd like to see all these guys do a perp walk and, you know, actually have to take responsibility for this action, isn't it enough just for people to know?
[02:13:31.637 --> 02:13:36.099]  Yeah, because if they have enough, then they have the power.
[02:13:36.240 --> 02:13:38.941]  If you know they're doing it to you, then maybe you won't let it happen again.
[02:13:39.372 --> 02:13:42.053]  It's harder to bend over to let them get in again, you know?
[02:13:42.073 --> 02:13:42.213]  Yeah.
[02:13:42.573 --> 02:13:45.314]  Well, it sounds cliche, but knowledge really is power.
[02:13:45.575 --> 02:13:46.095]  Exactly.
[02:13:46.455 --> 02:13:48.836]  Let's go back to the phones.
[02:13:48.856 --> 02:13:49.056]  800-259-9231.
[02:13:49.216 --> 02:13:52.457]  Again, Alex Jones coming up here in just about 14 minutes on the broadcast.
[02:13:52.758 --> 02:13:54.518]  John in Arizona, thank you for holding.
[02:13:54.558 --> 02:13:55.919]  You're on the air with Richard Siegel.
[02:13:56.439 --> 02:13:58.140]  Hey, thank you, Jack and Richard.
[02:13:58.500 --> 02:13:58.780]  Thank you.
[02:13:58.800 --> 02:14:01.521]  My question, I got, first of all, I'd like just to mention something.
[02:14:01.541 --> 02:14:06.183]  Now, this is not what I called about, but I would just play the devil's advocate here, and I'd like to mention something.
[02:14:07.015 --> 02:14:09.696]  How we get the information off of the Bilderbergs?
[02:14:10.616 --> 02:14:16.757]  I noticed last night that Alex mentioned that again on the air.
[02:14:16.817 --> 02:14:25.159]  I think that should be kept secret because how far into the future are we going to be able to keep collecting information if we give out the information on how we're getting the information?
[02:14:25.199 --> 02:14:27.419]  Well, what should be kept secret precisely?
[02:14:28.180 --> 02:14:29.560]  Okay, how they get the information.
[02:14:29.580 --> 02:14:29.960]  In other words...
[02:14:30.376 --> 02:14:33.738]  They have the employees there collect documentations out of the waste can.
[02:14:33.798 --> 02:14:35.199]  Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
[02:14:35.239 --> 02:14:36.660]  Okay, let's not talk about that anymore.
[02:14:36.920 --> 02:14:38.761]  What I call it about is the debt.
[02:14:39.081 --> 02:14:51.388]  When I go down here and talk to the veterans at the gas station in different places, they keep mentioning the AmeriCo and the America Union.
[02:14:54.430 --> 02:14:55.270]  What I'm calling about is...
[02:14:56.604 --> 02:15:03.628]  Will someday, will China call us on the debt and say, okay, now you owe us Yellowstone, now you owe us the Grand Canyon?
[02:15:03.908 --> 02:15:05.209]  Well, they can call in their debt.
[02:15:05.229 --> 02:15:06.810]  That doesn't mean we have to honor the debt.
[02:15:07.731 --> 02:15:08.851]  Repudiate all debt.
[02:15:09.792 --> 02:15:10.672]  What's that, Richard?
[02:15:10.752 --> 02:15:12.293]  We've got to repudiate all debt.
[02:15:13.074 --> 02:15:20.838]  I believe that as well, but we actually, I think they're buying, China alone is buying roughly about a billion dollars a day of our debt.
[02:15:21.239 --> 02:15:23.000]  Yeah, and they're chewing up and...
[02:15:23.945 --> 02:15:27.748]  You know, we haven't stopped this fiasco, and so has Japan.
[02:15:27.808 --> 02:15:29.330]  It's $7 trillion a year.
[02:15:30.170 --> 02:15:32.152]  Don't they still owe us from World War II?
[02:15:32.172 --> 02:15:33.793]  Let me just say this.
[02:15:33.813 --> 02:15:39.878]  $1 billion a day is, according to my analysis, exactly what we're paying in interest alone to the Federal Reserve.
[02:15:39.958 --> 02:15:43.121]  I'm sure that's gone up significantly since the Bush boys have been in office.
[02:15:43.641 --> 02:15:43.902]  Great.
[02:15:44.342 --> 02:15:46.424]  And they're part of that whole banking system, so...
[02:15:47.026 --> 02:15:48.488]  It's only feeding the whole frenzy.
[02:15:48.728 --> 02:15:51.051]  Why would they want to slow down the economy?
[02:15:51.532 --> 02:15:55.617]  If they want to get rid of the debt and pay off the debt, why is it so important to slow down the economy?
[02:15:55.657 --> 02:15:57.319]  They've raised the interest rates twice.
[02:15:57.700 --> 02:15:58.981]  They've raised the price on gas.
[02:15:59.362 --> 02:16:00.884]  The economy, when it was going good...
[02:16:01.314 --> 02:16:02.656]  We said it was going too good.
[02:16:02.896 --> 02:16:05.739]  Well, the ultimate goal is to crush America, not to make them strong.
[02:16:05.799 --> 02:16:09.082]  Yeah, I mean, what you're asking, John, is a very complicated question.
[02:16:09.102 --> 02:16:10.184]  I've done a lot of studying on this.
[02:16:10.224 --> 02:16:13.667]  I could just sit and talk for the next two hours on these economic issues.
[02:16:14.008 --> 02:16:15.649]  But let me give you the quick answer here.
[02:16:15.690 --> 02:16:17.832]  I mean, the goal is, you bring someone like Clinton in,
[02:16:18.232 --> 02:16:18.652]  We're good to go.
[02:16:44.270 --> 02:16:53.053]  They suck your house, your car, all of your real wealth into their giant financial holdings, and then we go back into popping the bubble.
[02:16:53.113 --> 02:16:55.214]  So it's inflating the bubble, popping the bubble.
[02:16:55.274 --> 02:17:00.836]  It's worked rather well for these banking vampires over the years, and I'm sorry that people fall for it.
[02:17:01.136 --> 02:17:01.937]  I don't have any debt.
[02:17:02.157 --> 02:17:04.318]  I don't take any loans, and I haven't for years.
[02:17:04.358 --> 02:17:06.398]  I don't believe in enabling the bankers.
[02:17:08.179 --> 02:17:09.159]  Thank you, John, for the call.
[02:17:09.179 --> 02:17:09.960]  We've got to keep moving.
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.080]  Don in North Carolina, thank you for holding.
[02:17:12.100 --> 02:17:13.401]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:17:14.301 --> 02:17:15.562]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[02:17:16.642 --> 02:17:17.723]  Can you hear me?
[02:17:18.043 --> 02:17:21.925]  I can, and we're just going to a break, so I've got to have you hold for a couple of more minutes.
[02:17:21.945 --> 02:17:23.026]  We'll bring you right up first.
[02:17:23.326 --> 02:17:25.027]  Dave in North Carolina, you're getting in.
[02:17:25.327 --> 02:17:27.068]  Dino in Oregon, you're getting in.
[02:17:27.148 --> 02:17:30.710]  Final segment coming up with Richard Siegel right after this, and then Alex Jones will be joining us.
[02:17:31.010 --> 02:17:34.312]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, GCN Radio Network.
[02:17:34.352 --> 02:17:34.732]  Stay tuned.
[02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:47.020]  We're good to go.
[02:18:08.831 --> 02:18:09.231]  We're good to go.

[02:18:46.494 --> 02:18:50.180]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:18:50.580 --> 02:18:56.008]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:18:56.469 --> 02:19:01.637]  It makes me wonder if the US citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:19:02.273 --> 02:19:15.599]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:19:16.079 --> 02:19:21.401]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:19:21.681 --> 02:19:27.584]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[02:19:27.944 --> 02:19:28.004]  1-800-686-2237
[02:19:47.478 --> 02:19:48.499]  The war on terrorism.
[02:19:48.839 --> 02:19:51.620]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:19:51.900 --> 02:19:56.043]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:19:56.483 --> 02:19:57.303]  So what do you do?
[02:19:57.623 --> 02:20:02.186]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:20:02.677 --> 02:20:04.798]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:20:05.298 --> 02:20:19.981]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:20:20.021 --> 02:20:27.083]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:20:27.443 --> 02:20:31.845]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[02:20:32.285 --> 02:20:36.326]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[02:20:36.606 --> 02:20:39.347]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:20:39.648 --> 02:20:43.589]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:20:45.530 --> 02:20:49.591]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:20:49.791 --> 02:20:53.193]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:20:53.373 --> 02:20:56.814]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:20:57.088 --> 02:21:00.349]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:21:00.369 --> 02:21:05.832]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:21:05.872 --> 02:21:15.496]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:21:15.636 --> 02:21:16.977]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[02:21:17.017 --> 02:21:22.419]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:21:22.919 --> 02:21:27.340]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:21:27.420 --> 02:21:28.800]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:21:28.960 --> 02:21:32.821]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[02:21:32.881 --> 02:21:33.701]  That toll-free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[02:21:55.319 --> 02:21:56.520]  We're good to go.
[02:22:14.625 --> 02:22:17.066]  I've been calling it the Super Bowl of 9-11 conferences and I've been to a few of them.
[02:22:31.412 --> 02:22:34.374]  I'm really looking forward to meet you, Richard, and everybody out there.
[02:22:34.394 --> 02:22:36.595]  I want to see everybody out there in Los Angeles.
[02:22:36.615 --> 02:22:42.558]  You can get your tickets again by going to Infowars.com or calling 888-253-3139.
[02:22:43.198 --> 02:22:44.719]  Just a few minutes left with you, Richard.
[02:22:44.779 --> 02:22:49.862]  Let's take a few more calls for you if we could, and then we'll thank you very much for being on the program with us today.
[02:22:50.702 --> 02:22:52.304]  I believe we had... Go ahead.
[02:22:52.644 --> 02:22:55.566]  I said they should get those tickets, otherwise they're going to be left out.
[02:22:55.626 --> 02:22:58.048]  I think there's going to be an awful lot of people who want to be there.
[02:22:58.308 --> 02:23:09.057]  Well, when people hear all the excitement that this is going to generate, and some of the guest speakers who we can't announce that are going to be attending this, they're going to be really upset at themselves for not going the extra mile and attending this convention.
[02:23:09.077 --> 02:23:10.338]  I mean, I don't like going to L.A.
[02:23:10.378 --> 02:23:14.181]  much myself, but I wouldn't miss this for the life of me, that's for sure.
[02:23:14.201 --> 02:23:15.502]  I'll go 12,000 miles for this, so...
[02:23:17.884 --> 02:23:18.384]  12,000 miles.
[02:23:18.604 --> 02:23:24.448]  If Richard can go halfway around the world, certainly some of you can go halfway around the country.
[02:23:24.729 --> 02:23:26.670]  This is going to make a major statement.
[02:23:27.211 --> 02:23:28.431]  It's going to be in all the newspapers.
[02:23:28.451 --> 02:23:32.755]  We need a lot of attention for this, and you're not going to want to miss being a part of it.
[02:23:32.775 --> 02:23:37.538]  This is something that really comes once in a lifetime, I think, Richard, and I'm so glad that you were invited to speak.
[02:23:37.598 --> 02:23:38.699]  I'm looking forward to hearing you.
[02:23:38.979 --> 02:23:40.160]  Let's go back to the phones real quick.
[02:23:40.400 --> 02:23:43.542]  Don in North Carolina, we cut you out towards that break, but you're back on the air.
[02:23:43.582 --> 02:23:44.203]  Thank you for calling.
[02:23:44.781 --> 02:23:45.381]  OK, thanks.
[02:23:45.701 --> 02:23:47.522]  I just wanted to pass on some information.
[02:23:47.542 --> 02:23:49.703]  I'm a retired pilot for US Airways.
[02:23:51.003 --> 02:24:03.008]  And two of the executives that used to be at US Airways, one was the CEO and the other was a financial officer, they're forming a new airline in India.
[02:24:03.048 --> 02:24:10.231]  It's called Indigo Air, in association with a group called Interglobe Air Transport.
[02:24:11.314 --> 02:24:23.659]  Now if you go to interglobe.com and you look at their network, their address in India is 911 Upper Level Empire Towers.
[02:24:25.880 --> 02:24:26.641]  And you can go look.
[02:24:26.701 --> 02:24:27.641]  I'm not making this stuff up.
[02:24:27.781 --> 02:24:33.544]  At US Airways, we had the chairman of Rothschild North America on our board of directors.
[02:24:34.684 --> 02:24:36.165]  We had the senior advisor.
[02:24:37.432 --> 02:24:39.853]  A senior advisor from Rothschild sitting on a board.
[02:24:39.873 --> 02:24:42.533]  They bankrupt the airline after 9-11.
[02:24:43.114 --> 02:24:45.534]  They took all the people's pensions.
[02:24:46.695 --> 02:24:50.376]  They were... They're building giant sports stadiums all around the country.
[02:24:50.396 --> 02:24:50.976]  Right.
[02:24:51.836 --> 02:24:53.476]  Mayor Giuliani was on the payroll.
[02:24:53.516 --> 02:24:55.477]  He was an advisor to the restructuring.
[02:24:55.857 --> 02:24:57.698]  His company, Giuliani Partners.
[02:24:58.278 --> 02:25:00.718]  We had a 28-year... The cleanup of all forensics.
[02:25:01.559 --> 02:25:02.559]  Yeah, the thing's sick.
[02:25:02.999 --> 02:25:06.520]  We had a 28-year veteran from the CIA sitting on the board.
[02:25:07.651 --> 02:25:13.255]  We also have this one lady that's... She's married to A.B.
[02:25:13.295 --> 02:25:14.135]  Bussey, Crown Guard.
[02:25:15.616 --> 02:25:20.099]  Who allegedly was involved in those put options at Insider Trading right before 9-11.
[02:25:20.139 --> 02:25:20.299]  Right.
[02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:24.803]  Yeah, you know, and I've actually read some information.
[02:25:24.983 --> 02:25:37.011]  I'm not sure how good the sourcing is, but it sounds believable to me that the Rockefeller Foundation owns roughly about 60-70% of all the airlines, and it's been alleged, and I happen to buy into this, that he has been...
[02:25:37.871 --> 02:25:40.332]  An agent of the Rothschilds the entire time.
[02:25:40.372 --> 02:25:41.332]  I mean, this really shows you.
[02:25:41.372 --> 02:25:42.772]  Here's the hypocrisy.
[02:25:42.792 --> 02:25:44.032]  They wrecked the company.
[02:25:44.052 --> 02:25:46.113]  It's being subsidized by the taxpayers.
[02:25:46.453 --> 02:25:54.575]  Most of them are bankrupt, yet you have Delta Arena, America Airlines Arena, America West Arena, where all these giant sporting events take place.
[02:25:55.495 --> 02:25:57.315]  That's more than a conflict of interest.
[02:25:57.395 --> 02:25:58.315]  It's total hypocrisy.
[02:25:59.796 --> 02:26:04.837]  There was also, back in the 80s, when I was researching some of the board members, we had a Rockefeller.
[02:26:04.917 --> 02:26:05.737]  One of the ladies was...
[02:26:07.358 --> 02:26:08.479]  She was a Rockefeller.
[02:26:08.499 --> 02:26:11.742]  I don't know if it was a granddaughter, but it was a Rockefeller.
[02:26:11.762 --> 02:26:13.443]  So it all makes sense, you know.
[02:26:13.963 --> 02:26:21.490]  And what happens is after they terminate these pensions, they restructure the airline, they reissue new stock, and then these people disappear and then they move on.
[02:26:22.330 --> 02:26:26.574]  They go into other companies and you find them popping up again on another board somewhere.
[02:26:26.954 --> 02:26:27.835]  They're the cleanup crew.
[02:26:28.790 --> 02:26:30.152]  I had a question real quick.
[02:26:31.153 --> 02:26:35.077]  Is there a chance maybe you could call the Airline Pilots Union?
[02:26:35.097 --> 02:26:36.058]  I can give you their number.
[02:26:36.078 --> 02:26:41.023]  See if you can get the president of the Airline Pilots Union to be on your show.
[02:26:41.598 --> 02:26:44.399]  Because I think Galpin knows more about what happened, too.
[02:26:44.439 --> 02:26:44.639]  Right.
[02:26:44.940 --> 02:26:46.360]  Well, I don't know if they do it or not.
[02:26:46.440 --> 02:26:48.341]  They probably won't.
[02:26:48.381 --> 02:26:49.942]  I'd be happy to give it a shot.
[02:26:50.022 --> 02:26:56.945]  JackBlood at Hotmail.com or you can email the InfoWars crew here and we'll take a look into it.
[02:26:57.586 --> 02:26:58.786]  Thanks for your call, man.
[02:26:58.806 --> 02:27:00.327]  That was very interesting.
[02:27:00.687 --> 02:27:03.889]  You know, isn't that the way it works, though, Richard, as we let you go here?
[02:27:03.909 --> 02:27:06.650]  I mean, we are forced to investigate this ourselves.
[02:27:06.690 --> 02:27:10.932]  So many people are coming forward like yourself and we're really taking it to them.
[02:27:12.122 --> 02:27:13.822]  Yes, that's exactly how it works.
[02:27:14.482 --> 02:27:16.363]  Unfortunately, we have to be the one to investigate.
[02:27:16.403 --> 02:27:18.223]  Our government won't do it.
[02:27:18.243 --> 02:27:19.343]  9-11-Eyewitness.com.
[02:27:19.383 --> 02:27:20.624]  Richard, thank you for joining us.
[02:27:20.664 --> 02:27:22.224]  I look forward to meeting you in Los Angeles.
[02:27:22.444 --> 02:27:22.824]  Excellent.
[02:27:22.864 --> 02:27:23.644]  Thanks for having me.
[02:27:23.924 --> 02:27:24.684]  Keep the faith, brother.
[02:27:25.004 --> 02:27:28.045]  Alex Jones coming up right after this with an update from Ottawa, Canada.
[02:27:28.065 --> 02:27:28.545]  Stay tuned.
[02:27:36.446 --> 02:27:37.347]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.827 --> 02:27:39.347]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.363 --> 02:27:43.049]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.192 --> 02:27:52.496]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:52.876 --> 02:27:57.558]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:27:57.879 --> 02:28:05.543]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:05.823 --> 02:28:12.687]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:12.907 --> 02:28:14.268]  There are no side effects.
[02:28:38.681 --> 02:28:41.583]  That's 866-885-6625.
[02:28:41.923 --> 02:28:45.685]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:28:46.566 --> 02:28:50.128]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[02:28:50.168 --> 02:28:50.688]  are located?
[02:28:50.888 --> 02:28:54.290]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[02:28:54.510 --> 02:28:59.233]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[02:28:59.493 --> 02:29:04.496]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[02:29:04.656 --> 02:29:05.336]  We're good to go.
[02:29:24.421 --> 02:29:27.442]  That's 888-803-4438 to order on the web or at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:29:46.110 --> 02:29:53.372]  United States Pharmacopoeia, USP, sets the standard for most food supplements and are used in over 95% of all vitamin and mineral supplements in the world.
[02:29:53.572 --> 02:29:56.593]  The problem is that these products have never appeared in any living tissue.
[02:29:56.713 --> 02:30:00.074]  They're created in laboratories and are not recognizable to the body's metabolism.
[02:30:00.534 --> 02:30:09.456]  Grown by nature, products are different because they use re-natured ingredients, proprietary blends of essential vitamins and minerals, with cofactors of proteins, lipids, and complex carbohydrates.
[02:30:09.896 --> 02:30:10.396]  We're good to go.
[02:30:31.770 --> 02:30:33.511]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:30:59.557 --> 02:31:01.798]  Jack Wood, sitting in for Alex Jones today.
[02:31:01.978 --> 02:31:03.538]  Thank you so much for having me.
[02:31:04.058 --> 02:31:06.159]  It's not just Alex Jones who invites me here.
[02:31:06.219 --> 02:31:10.220]  It's you that allow me to be here and get away unscathed.
[02:31:10.240 --> 02:31:13.520]  We do the very best we can, and it's just always an honor to fill in for Alex.
[02:31:13.560 --> 02:31:17.341]  It's an honor to speak to all you great listeners, a lot of which are listening on shortwave.
[02:31:17.361 --> 02:31:18.041]  I don't get to hear you.
[02:31:18.081 --> 02:31:20.502]  A lot of which are listening on affiliates that I'm not on.
[02:31:21.002 --> 02:31:26.585]  I asked the affiliates that carry the program, the very brave affiliates, who I love complimenting, why don't you have me on?
[02:31:26.625 --> 02:31:29.447]  The affiliates we are on are doing wonderfully with our program.
[02:31:29.707 --> 02:31:34.130]  We're on satellite as well, Deadline Live, Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:31:34.150 --> 02:31:40.974]  We're very easy to add to your lineup, and a lot of people think Alex and I make a pretty good one-two punch, so think about that.
[02:31:40.994 --> 02:31:42.935]  We do have Alex Jones from Ottawa, Canada.
[02:31:43.355 --> 02:31:46.057]  People have been patiently waiting for an update from you, Alex.
[02:31:46.097 --> 02:31:46.777]  Good to hear from you.
[02:31:46.797 --> 02:31:47.718]  Good to know you're all right.
[02:31:47.738 --> 02:31:50.119]  I thought you did great last night on the George Norrie Show.
[02:31:51.368 --> 02:31:51.748]  Well, sure.
[02:31:51.808 --> 02:31:59.155]  I was on Jeff's show, and I'm Jeff Renz of Genesis Communications, and I was on with George and we were on Coast to Coast AM.
[02:31:59.175 --> 02:32:01.057]  I, at that time, had been up for almost 48 hours.
[02:32:01.117 --> 02:32:09.004]  I had like an hour nap, fitfully rolling around before I did interviews last night, but I think we basically got the information out there.
[02:32:09.604 --> 02:32:14.028]  I would have called in earlier, but we've been down at the Brook Street Hotel.
[02:32:15.029 --> 02:32:17.772]  They're getting video of the Bilderberg Group meeting
[02:32:18.964 --> 02:32:25.887]  Basically over the fence with security guards running up to us telling us not to film them as they play golf in the drizzle.
[02:32:27.428 --> 02:32:31.069]  And then of course at night they go in and have their globalist meetings.
[02:32:31.109 --> 02:32:36.011]  I mean this is a group that all over the world they have reporters arrested and detained.
[02:32:36.291 --> 02:32:37.692]  Reporters with no criminal record.
[02:32:38.492 --> 02:32:45.995]  And that happened to me two days ago when I came into Canada 15 hours that they had seized our cameras and everything.
[02:32:47.515 --> 02:32:49.056]  And it was just absolutely horrible.
[02:32:50.538 --> 02:32:52.879]  Jack, I could go over some of the things that happened, if you'd like.
[02:32:52.899 --> 02:32:56.783]  Yeah, well, give us a breakdown, because right now we haven't gotten any information.
[02:32:56.823 --> 02:32:58.304]  We don't know what they're talking about.
[02:32:58.344 --> 02:33:00.045]  We don't know how this is all coming together.
[02:33:00.085 --> 02:33:03.148]  I know that you caught David Rockefeller coming in yesterday.
[02:33:03.168 --> 02:33:09.473]  I don't know if you saw Jeff Gannon making a swift entrance or any of the servants of the New World Order coming in there.
[02:33:09.493 --> 02:33:11.174]  But tell us what we know right now.
[02:33:11.214 --> 02:33:13.076]  Do we know anything about what they're talking about?
[02:33:13.136 --> 02:33:15.838]  Can we give people any information about this conference?
[02:33:16.972 --> 02:33:17.612]  Well, we can.
[02:33:18.473 --> 02:33:20.413]  We can do that, Jack.
[02:33:21.854 --> 02:33:22.834]  We did today.
[02:33:22.854 --> 02:33:24.535]  I just came in with Jim Tucker.
[02:33:24.595 --> 02:33:26.055]  He's been covering for 27 years.
[02:33:26.075 --> 02:33:37.460]  I just walked into our hotel and his source inside the Bilderberg Group had faxed him the complete list, so we now have that.
[02:33:37.500 --> 02:33:40.821]  There's been some incomplete list covered by the Canadian
[02:33:41.511 --> 02:33:44.692]  News, but we have the former head of the World Bank, James Wolfsenson, there.
[02:33:45.172 --> 02:33:54.234]  We have David Rockefeller, Queen Beatrix was photographed for the national news here with huge long lenses from about 200 yards away, getting out of her Mercedes, all of her guards.
[02:33:55.234 --> 02:34:04.657]  And it's 120 of the most powerful people in the world openly pushing their agenda for a one world government.
[02:34:04.697 --> 02:34:09.118]  Most listeners understand what the Builder Bird Group is about, what they do, but
[02:34:10.197 --> 02:34:31.868]  It really is scary that they had called the Canadian customs people and they were waiting for us and they pulled us all immediately out of line and pulled no one else out of line, just us, and berated us and cussed at us and screamed at us off and on for 15 hours and told us that if they could find anything on us we were going to jail.
[02:34:32.931 --> 02:34:37.892]  And then at the end the media all showed up and within an hour the media showing up outside.
[02:34:37.932 --> 02:34:48.655]  They totally did a 180 and released this and were asking us to please not attack them and that they have families and that they were just doing their job and that they'd been told to do all of this.
[02:34:48.695 --> 02:34:59.358]  But it really shows you how evil these globalists are that have been meeting since 1954 and of course before that but they got the official name Bilderberg Group then and that
[02:35:00.710 --> 02:35:01.091]  I think so.
[02:35:21.052 --> 02:35:23.673]  Wouldn't they expect that, though, having the conference in North America?
[02:35:23.693 --> 02:35:25.914]  I mean, why did they have this in North America this year?
[02:35:25.934 --> 02:35:28.496]  Alex, is this in our face trying to tell us something here?
[02:35:28.916 --> 02:35:30.297]  Well, it's even worse, Jack.
[02:35:30.357 --> 02:35:33.178]  I mean, they have even bigger crowds now showing up in Europe.
[02:35:33.458 --> 02:35:35.279]  Hundreds of reporters there.
[02:35:35.319 --> 02:35:39.021]  I'd say I've probably seen 50-plus, you know, not hundreds.
[02:35:39.933 --> 02:35:40.634]  Since we've been here.
[02:35:40.694 --> 02:35:48.400]  But you know the American people are detached, and what happens in Europe really doesn't count or doesn't enter into their consciousness, but right here on our own continent.
[02:35:48.660 --> 02:35:52.404]  Yeah, every four years they have the meeting in North America.
[02:35:53.444 --> 02:36:01.952]  They alternate between Canada and the U.S., and what was it, four years ago they had it in Virginia, remember?
[02:36:02.632 --> 02:36:05.855]  So they were just scheduled to have it here and have it now, and
[02:36:06.491 --> 02:36:18.116]  To see all these cars coming in with blacked out windows, and even when the windows blacked out, they would cover both sides of their faces, kind of like when you see Ken Lay or some criminal come out of being indicted, and they're covering their faces.
[02:36:18.197 --> 02:36:23.819]  I mean, it just shows the evil deeds they're doing, that they're so secretive about it.
[02:36:24.399 --> 02:36:33.344]  But I just want to thank all the listeners of Genesis, all the listeners of Jeff Renzel, all the listeners of George Norrie, because it's a big scandal up here now.
[02:36:34.284 --> 02:36:34.824]  James Tucker...
[02:36:37.368 --> 02:36:46.290]  Yeah, he was here, and we were able to talk to him, and he told some reporters what had happened to us at a press conference, and that's when I all went down to the airport.
[02:36:46.730 --> 02:36:50.671]  They were telling me I was going to be put back on a plane, but not before I was interrogated some more.
[02:36:50.691 --> 02:36:51.852]  They said, this is going to take a long time.
[02:36:51.892 --> 02:36:52.752]  They were laughing at me.
[02:36:54.232 --> 02:36:56.653]  It was just torture, psychological torture.
[02:36:56.673 --> 02:36:58.353]  They were really enjoying themselves.
[02:36:58.373 --> 02:36:59.994]  That's what was so pathetic about it.
[02:37:01.194 --> 02:37:05.935]  If it wasn't for the CBC showing up, if it wasn't for the Ottawa Citizen showing up and some others...
[02:37:06.889 --> 02:37:10.050]  We would have been basically interrogated for about 20 hours, as it was.
[02:37:10.090 --> 02:37:11.271]  We were kept there 15 hours.
[02:37:12.031 --> 02:37:16.753]  And we would have been kicked out of the country, and I'd be back in Austin, Texas right now doing the radio show, Jack.
[02:37:17.614 --> 02:37:20.115]  And we still also have to leave this infernal place.
[02:37:20.635 --> 02:37:21.896]  And I'm not bashing Canada.
[02:37:21.916 --> 02:37:26.558]  Ottawa's beautiful, but I mean, I have to leave that infernal airport with those people just waiting for me.
[02:37:26.578 --> 02:37:33.421]  But I think now that they realize that they weren't going to operate in a vacuum, that there was light shining in, that they weren't going to get away with it.
[02:37:33.832 --> 02:37:39.519]  And the other key here is that different members of customs admitted twice later once they were trying to be conciliatory.
[02:37:39.559 --> 02:37:41.441]  Well, once while they weren't and then twice at the end.
[02:37:41.721 --> 02:37:45.766]  So that's three times total that they were told to do this.
[02:37:45.806 --> 02:37:47.809]  That they were told to do this to me.
[02:37:47.829 --> 02:37:48.890]  That they were told to stop us.
[02:37:50.029 --> 02:37:52.510]  That the, quote, conference is what they would call it.
[02:37:52.530 --> 02:37:53.430]  They wouldn't call it Bilderberg.
[02:37:53.450 --> 02:37:54.190]  They wouldn't even tell the name.
[02:37:54.210 --> 02:37:55.490]  They were just told it's the conference.
[02:37:56.190 --> 02:37:58.571]  That they were concerned about me trying to infiltrate.
[02:37:58.671 --> 02:38:01.731]  I had to swear that I wasn't going to try to infiltrate, which was never my plan.
[02:38:01.751 --> 02:38:02.431]  I said, then on air.
[02:38:02.471 --> 02:38:08.153]  I said, I'm coming to cover it and cover the media and the history of the media covering it and to make a documentary about it.
[02:38:08.873 --> 02:38:14.134]  And they got just, I guess, very fearful that I was coming here to do this.
[02:38:14.174 --> 02:38:15.534]  And so I was red flagged.
[02:38:16.427 --> 02:38:20.668]  Mainly because I snuck into Bohemian Grove and the customs people knew all about that.
[02:38:21.909 --> 02:38:22.869]  It was horrible.
[02:38:23.929 --> 02:38:26.130]  Jack, they would interrogate mainly myself.
[02:38:26.190 --> 02:38:27.730]  They'd pull my guys and interrogate them.
[02:38:27.771 --> 02:38:30.371]  Then we'd be sitting there in the office.
[02:38:32.712 --> 02:38:38.954]  They did all sorts of things, but Ryan Slickheisen, who you know, said, ìHey, Alex,
[02:38:39.833 --> 02:38:40.654]  What's going to happen?
[02:38:40.674 --> 02:38:42.715]  What are they saying behind closed doors?
[02:38:42.735 --> 02:38:43.956]  This is about 3.30 a.m.
[02:38:44.497 --> 02:38:46.098]  after about three and a half hours being interrogated.
[02:38:46.658 --> 02:38:52.363]  And I just said, oh, looks like we're going to have to stay here and then leave tomorrow, fly out tomorrow.
[02:38:52.843 --> 02:38:55.185]  And the guy starts going, oh, you plan to escape.
[02:38:55.665 --> 02:38:57.687]  Oh, now I have evidence that you're saying you're planning to escape.
[02:38:57.707 --> 02:38:59.168]  And I said, wait a minute.
[02:38:59.528 --> 02:39:00.709]  I've been real nice up until then.
[02:39:00.769 --> 02:39:01.469]  I said, wait a minute.
[02:39:02.050 --> 02:39:04.772]  I said, you already called me a liar a bunch, and that's not true.
[02:39:05.072 --> 02:39:06.273]  You're making stuff up.
[02:39:06.293 --> 02:39:06.914]  Be quiet, be quiet.
[02:39:06.934 --> 02:39:07.334]  I said, no.
[02:39:08.348 --> 02:39:09.249]  I'm an American citizen.
[02:39:09.269 --> 02:39:09.909]  I have rights.
[02:39:09.929 --> 02:39:10.829]  I've done nothing here.
[02:39:11.730 --> 02:39:13.051]  You're acting like this is Russia.
[02:39:13.471 --> 02:39:15.552]  I was just saying, we're probably going to have to leave tomorrow.
[02:39:15.652 --> 02:39:16.573]  That's what you've said.
[02:39:17.453 --> 02:39:18.133]  So stop it.
[02:39:18.654 --> 02:39:21.675]  And then they came over and started getting around me and said, you go in here.
[02:39:21.695 --> 02:39:22.776]  And they put me in another room.
[02:39:22.816 --> 02:39:24.217]  And it was just horrible.
[02:39:24.237 --> 02:39:33.702]  And then to have the head supervisor come in that next day at 11 and just march up to us in front of Ryan and Aaron Dykes.
[02:39:34.739 --> 02:39:41.720]  Walking us back into another area to be interrogated, just started screaming, you Americans, you know, SH all over us.
[02:39:41.740 --> 02:39:46.161]  You know, you Americans, you're just all sorts of insults.
[02:39:46.741 --> 02:39:49.502]  Just screaming and then saying, I want you to tell me this.
[02:39:49.542 --> 02:39:52.442]  I try to talk and he goes, shut up, shut up, shut up.
[02:39:52.882 --> 02:39:56.183]  Then he'd ask another question and he'd go, I have to answer my question.
[02:39:56.583 --> 02:39:59.623]  And then I'd try to answer, he'd go, shut up, shut up.
[02:40:00.063 --> 02:40:01.284]  I told you, shut up.
[02:40:01.684 --> 02:40:04.104]  So it just went, I mean, it's like a drill sergeant
[02:40:04.727 --> 02:40:05.207]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:40:34.206 --> 02:40:42.610]  One of the morals of the story is, and you talked yesterday about how they were looking through your laptops trying to find something on you, trying to find some pornography that they could use against you and even arrest you for.
[02:40:42.630 --> 02:40:45.391]  I can't imagine what would have happened.
[02:40:45.431 --> 02:40:46.632]  Here's the moral of the story, folks.
[02:40:47.172 --> 02:40:51.534]  This is why you want to fly straight, especially when you're going to attend something like this and cover a media event.
[02:40:51.755 --> 02:40:59.619]  You've got to be very careful because, Alex, if they'd have found something on you, anything on any of you or your crew, this would have been in the New York Times, it would have been covered all over.
[02:40:59.659 --> 02:41:02.320]  You would have been dismembered in the mainstream media.
[02:41:03.058 --> 02:41:04.939]  I don't know, I was walking into a huge setup.
[02:41:05.019 --> 02:41:22.748]  I mean, imagine, there's several flights came in at once, there's hundreds of people ahead of us, we're standing in line, and I notice they're already looking at us, and more guards are coming forward, and then we, they have like four windows, well, there's actually about six windows, but just a few guys at the windows, and you normally just walk up, they check it, they stamp it, you go through, you're gone.
[02:41:23.449 --> 02:41:26.430]  They search your bags after that, or send them through an x-ray machine.
[02:41:27.031 --> 02:41:31.333]  That didn't happen, it was just immediately, just looking at me, smiling, you, go in there,
[02:41:32.037 --> 02:41:36.598]  And then there were guards making sure I went in there, and I walked in, and it just started.
[02:41:36.618 --> 02:41:38.939]  The guy up front said, well, I don't think I'm going to let you into Canada.
[02:41:39.579 --> 02:41:41.379]  And I politely said, well, why?
[02:41:41.399 --> 02:41:42.519]  And he goes, because you're not media.
[02:41:43.139 --> 02:41:48.001]  And that very same guy, like, two hours later goes, oh, I've seen one of your documentaries, Alex.
[02:41:48.041 --> 02:41:48.721]  I know you're media.
[02:41:49.541 --> 02:41:51.081]  And then they take it like, well, what are you here for?
[02:41:51.101 --> 02:41:52.321]  Well, I'm here to interview the press.
[02:41:52.782 --> 02:41:53.742]  I'm here to cover a conference.
[02:41:53.802 --> 02:41:56.482]  I'm here to try to talk to members of parliament.
[02:41:56.502 --> 02:41:57.503]  That's where I'm going in about an hour.
[02:41:58.563 --> 02:41:58.683]  And...
[02:42:00.134 --> 02:42:01.055]  Then they would say, well, which is it?
[02:42:01.075 --> 02:42:01.776]  You're a liar.
[02:42:02.036 --> 02:42:02.736]  You're a liar.
[02:42:02.917 --> 02:42:04.138]  Is it talking to the media?
[02:42:04.338 --> 02:42:05.239]  Or is it covering a conference?
[02:42:05.279 --> 02:42:05.699]  Or is it them?
[02:42:05.719 --> 02:42:06.460]  You're a liar.
[02:42:06.660 --> 02:42:07.721]  You've told me three different things.
[02:42:07.741 --> 02:42:08.462]  And I go, what do you mean?
[02:42:08.542 --> 02:42:09.403]  I go, don't try that.
[02:42:09.663 --> 02:42:10.804]  I'm here to interview a bunch of people.
[02:42:10.824 --> 02:42:11.725]  I'm making a documentary.
[02:42:12.025 --> 02:42:14.027]  I'm shooting probably video 12 hours a day.
[02:42:14.628 --> 02:42:15.268]  You're a liar.
[02:42:15.348 --> 02:42:15.789]  Shut up.
[02:42:15.809 --> 02:42:18.051]  You know, just, oh, you've lied to me.
[02:42:18.091 --> 02:42:18.832]  You've lied to me.
[02:42:18.892 --> 02:42:20.153]  I can't believe you've lied to me.
[02:42:21.637 --> 02:42:22.558]  And it was just totally sick.
[02:42:22.598 --> 02:42:31.182]  You mentioned last night, when I heard you on George Norrie, that you were forced to make some type of a statement to get out of that situation or to pacify these people.
[02:42:31.543 --> 02:42:32.403]  Well, yeah.
[02:42:32.503 --> 02:42:37.666]  Then they switched from vitriolic craziness to, I'm not going to let you come into the country.
[02:42:37.746 --> 02:42:40.067]  And then, well, I'm not making a deal with you.
[02:42:40.087 --> 02:42:40.568]  You understand?
[02:42:40.588 --> 02:42:41.708]  You're not recording this, are you?
[02:42:41.728 --> 02:42:42.669]  You're not recording this, are you?
[02:42:43.349 --> 02:42:43.589]  No.
[02:42:43.989 --> 02:42:47.611]  And then they had me lift my pants legs up in the interrogation room, and they're looking around me.
[02:42:47.652 --> 02:42:49.733]  And I'm going, look, guys, I'm not recording this.
[02:42:49.753 --> 02:42:50.193]  You know that.
[02:42:50.973 --> 02:42:54.674]  And they go, you know, we've got kids too, and now we can get in a lot of trouble for this.
[02:42:54.734 --> 02:42:57.335]  And I'm not going to say trouble for what, but we just were told to do this.
[02:42:58.176 --> 02:42:59.196]  And, you know, you were rude.
[02:42:59.236 --> 02:43:00.136]  And I said, how was I rude?
[02:43:00.177 --> 02:43:01.097]  Well, you said this was Russia.
[02:43:01.157 --> 02:43:08.960]  And I said, after I'm being accused of trying to escape, sitting there in a chair with one of your officers five feet away saying, I guess we'll have to leave tomorrow, fly out.
[02:43:10.040 --> 02:43:11.701]  I said, you know, come on.
[02:43:12.321 --> 02:43:14.042]  He said, well, and you said something else.
[02:43:14.102 --> 02:43:16.163]  He calls another guy and he goes, what was it he said?
[02:43:18.643 --> 02:43:19.383]  I mean, it was nothing.
[02:43:19.403 --> 02:43:31.850]  It was actually just talking to them and they said, listen, you need to tell them out there that we just did our job and that you were a smart ass to us and I want your word on that or we're not going to let you.
[02:43:32.471 --> 02:43:34.872]  Well, technically, I said, okay, you got my word.
[02:43:35.372 --> 02:43:38.234]  And so I walked out and said, well, you know, takes two to tango.
[02:43:38.254 --> 02:43:39.155]  That's why that's in the press.
[02:43:39.915 --> 02:43:41.436]  These guys claim they were just doing their job.
[02:43:42.280 --> 02:43:43.741]  I might have been a little bit rude.
[02:43:46.822 --> 02:43:48.362]  Now I still have to go back through these people.
[02:43:49.803 --> 02:43:50.963]  I don't even care.
[02:43:50.983 --> 02:43:54.684]  Jack, I literally got tears in my eyes twice.
[02:43:54.845 --> 02:43:57.245]  Not because I couldn't handle stress or someone screaming at me.
[02:43:57.746 --> 02:43:59.166]  I was sad for these people.
[02:43:59.186 --> 02:44:01.047]  It was a new type of feeling for me.
[02:44:01.067 --> 02:44:04.208]  They were so pathetic and so sad.
[02:44:04.328 --> 02:44:06.129]  I was sad for America.
[02:44:06.149 --> 02:44:07.289]  I was sad for Canada.
[02:44:08.421 --> 02:44:09.722]  I mean, I know what this means.
[02:44:09.802 --> 02:44:12.244]  Everything our forefathers fought for is literally going.
[02:44:12.604 --> 02:44:14.326]  This was once a very free country here, too.
[02:44:14.346 --> 02:44:20.230]  And that they could twist people's minds, twist their souls to act like this, and that they could be kidding off on it.
[02:44:20.650 --> 02:44:21.871]  I was sad for my family.
[02:44:21.911 --> 02:44:22.932]  I was sad for my children.
[02:44:22.952 --> 02:44:24.012]  I was sad for our future.
[02:44:24.033 --> 02:44:26.014]  It was just so pathetic.
[02:44:26.054 --> 02:44:29.737]  So then they're all groveling, basically, and all freaked out.
[02:44:30.017 --> 02:44:31.398]  And I actually felt sorry for them.
[02:44:32.038 --> 02:44:35.861]  And then I went out there and basically said what they wanted.
[02:44:36.454 --> 02:44:37.414]  But then I thought about it.
[02:44:37.934 --> 02:44:40.295]  They really treated me horribly and were getting off on this.
[02:44:40.335 --> 02:44:44.036]  At the same time, I'm not going to be deceptive to my listening audience.
[02:44:44.336 --> 02:44:46.297]  So I just told people about what was said and what happened.
[02:44:48.458 --> 02:44:53.059]  Obviously, there's a lot more you can say once you get on the other side of the border and back in your chair.
[02:44:53.079 --> 02:44:54.559]  By the way, I wasn't out at the airport.
[02:44:54.579 --> 02:44:56.600]  I had them standing behind me when I walked up to the press.
[02:44:59.206 --> 02:44:59.726]  Do you understand?
[02:44:59.927 --> 02:45:04.711]  I mean, look, a lot of people have said, well, why did Alex announce that he was going up there?
[02:45:04.771 --> 02:45:07.233]  I mean, didn't he expect to get this kind of treatment?
[02:45:07.293 --> 02:45:14.899]  And I thought the good response to that would be, I mean, it's a way to protect yourself to let people know where you're going so that they can get your back.
[02:45:14.939 --> 02:45:16.720]  I mean, I think you kind of had to do that, didn't you?
[02:45:17.081 --> 02:45:18.342]  I've always been out in the light.
[02:45:18.802 --> 02:45:20.583]  I've always, that's where I try to operate.
[02:45:21.544 --> 02:45:27.189]  And I mean, I let the enemy know, I let the New World Order know what I'm doing.
[02:45:28.135 --> 02:45:28.796]  I announced on air.
[02:45:28.836 --> 02:45:30.917]  I'm coming up here to try to talk to members of Parliament.
[02:45:30.937 --> 02:45:32.919]  I'm coming up here to interview people that have been covering Bilderberg.
[02:45:32.939 --> 02:45:34.300]  I'm here to try to get video of these people.
[02:45:34.780 --> 02:45:36.801]  And what I announced on air is what I've been doing here.
[02:45:36.821 --> 02:45:38.883]  And that's what I told them when I came in here.
[02:45:39.703 --> 02:45:42.686]  I can't wait to get the details of what they're talking about in this conference.
[02:45:42.706 --> 02:45:45.368]  When are you going to be able to relay that to your listening audience?
[02:45:45.808 --> 02:45:50.351]  Well, we have sources inside, and we know what's in the agenda because they're Bilderberg steering groups.
[02:45:50.451 --> 02:45:57.056]  And then we'll really know weeks after as Bilderberg delegate members begin to push their propaganda all over TV, radio, and print.
[02:45:57.702 --> 02:46:00.523]  Which certainly confirms the information that you're getting.
[02:46:00.864 --> 02:46:01.964]  Well, we know what the agenda is.
[02:46:02.044 --> 02:46:03.785]  There's a split on attacking Iran.
[02:46:03.825 --> 02:46:05.926]  It's not as big as the split was on attacking Iraq.
[02:46:07.307 --> 02:46:09.068]  We know that boosting oil prices is there.
[02:46:09.108 --> 02:46:11.369]  We know going after Hugo Chavez is on the agenda.
[02:46:12.609 --> 02:46:21.234]  We know also that getting the American Union, which the CFR is trying to implement through Bush's blanket amnesty plan, we know that is being discussed last year and it will be discussed this year.
[02:46:21.574 --> 02:46:23.835]  They want a global tax on oil at the wellhead.
[02:46:23.875 --> 02:46:25.696]  They want a global tax on money transfers.
[02:46:26.351 --> 02:46:27.852]  To start that president for world government.
[02:46:27.872 --> 02:46:30.534]  They've got their world army, their world court, their world laws.
[02:46:30.994 --> 02:46:37.378]  Now they need a world taxing mechanism instead of just getting billions of dollars from developed nations every year to go into their kitty.
[02:46:38.119 --> 02:46:39.359]  They're at the United Nations.
[02:46:40.800 --> 02:46:41.461]  That's what's happening.
[02:46:41.481 --> 02:46:52.408]  You've got the richest men in the world, the richest women in the world here pushing for higher taxes worldwide, quote, getting rid of tax havens because these elites use government to take middle class money and then pay it to their companies as corporate welfare.
[02:46:53.666 --> 02:46:55.508]  What media moguls have you seen up there?
[02:46:55.548 --> 02:46:56.508]  Any that you can tell us about?
[02:46:56.989 --> 02:46:57.649]  There's a lot.
[02:46:57.709 --> 02:47:03.213]  There's some governors, former governors, the Canadian ambassador to the U.S.
[02:47:04.153 --> 02:47:07.095]  Most of them come in in cars so blacked out, speeding through.
[02:47:07.115 --> 02:47:12.519]  They open the gate, and then they speed through, and then they park under trees.
[02:47:12.930 --> 02:47:13.230]  We're good.
[02:47:36.303 --> 02:47:39.985]  Towards the road 200 yards away.
[02:47:40.005 --> 02:47:43.887]  Let me ask you this before we run out of time, because I want to make sure we get everything in here.
[02:47:43.927 --> 02:47:51.772]  We have about a minute left in this segment, and I want to know, I think listeners want to know, do you see any potential presidential candidates attending this Bilderberg conference?
[02:47:52.052 --> 02:47:57.175]  Well, we know that Governor Warner of Virginia attended last year.
[02:47:58.324 --> 02:48:01.885]  And we know that he is the favorite to run on the Democratic ticket.
[02:48:03.006 --> 02:48:04.706]  He and Hillary will fight it out.
[02:48:05.106 --> 02:48:08.128]  But he's definitely the darling of these guys.
[02:48:08.148 --> 02:48:11.669]  So you have Mitt Romney, John Edwards, Huckabee, Biden?
[02:48:11.809 --> 02:48:14.770]  Well, we'll actually have the whole list here.
[02:48:15.430 --> 02:48:16.110]  It's about 120 names.
[02:48:16.130 --> 02:48:20.812]  And we're going to be posting that in the next few hours on InfoWars.com and hence...
[02:48:21.440 --> 02:48:26.745]  PrisonPlanet.com, and so Monday we can give people a whole detailed rundown of what's going on.
[02:48:27.005 --> 02:48:29.086]  We'll all be waiting with bated breath to do that.
[02:48:29.447 --> 02:48:31.569]  Alex, Godspeed, okay?
[02:48:31.769 --> 02:48:32.629]  Take care of yourself.
[02:48:32.649 --> 02:48:33.931]  We want you back here on Monday.
[02:48:33.991 --> 02:48:35.912]  Jack, is there a final segment coming up?
[02:48:35.932 --> 02:48:36.413]  Yes, there is.
[02:48:36.493 --> 02:48:37.253]  Hang over, okay?
[02:48:37.353 --> 02:48:37.794]  I'll hang over.
[02:48:37.834 --> 02:48:39.315]  We'll come right back more with Alex Jones.
[02:48:39.335 --> 02:48:40.716]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:48:40.796 --> 02:48:41.477]  I'm Jack Blood.
[02:48:41.497 --> 02:48:41.897]  Stay tuned.
[02:48:41.937 --> 02:48:43.839]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:48:46.080 --> 02:48:54.347]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here, and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[02:48:54.547 --> 02:48:56.889]  We're expecting around 1,000 people in attendance.
[02:48:57.490 --> 02:49:06.318]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[02:49:06.838 --> 02:49:10.359]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda.
[02:49:10.799 --> 02:49:31.607]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Tarpley, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[02:49:31.927 --> 02:49:35.648]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.

[02:50:38.621 --> 02:50:39.621]  Herbal Healer Academy
[02:51:02.708 --> 02:51:03.369]  We're good to go.
[02:51:32.228 --> 02:51:35.310]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:35.490 --> 02:51:41.355]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:47.480 --> 02:52:04.021]  Well, I am wrapping up my two-day stint here in the InfoWars studio, spelling in for the great Alex Jones, and it has just been...
[02:52:04.441 --> 02:52:05.262]  Awesome doing it.
[02:52:05.322 --> 02:52:07.863]  I love talking to you listeners, the Alex Jones listeners.
[02:52:07.903 --> 02:52:09.604]  They are some of the best in the world.
[02:52:09.644 --> 02:52:11.205]  I have another two hours to go.
[02:52:11.545 --> 02:52:14.167]  Deadline Live coming up right after this on this very network.
[02:52:14.327 --> 02:52:15.988]  Alex, final few minutes here.
[02:52:16.068 --> 02:52:16.989]  Tell us what we need to know.
[02:52:17.729 --> 02:52:26.034]  Well, it was just that we also had undercover police, the classic six-foot-four guy in the shorts and the shirt going, Hey, man, what's going on?
[02:52:26.454 --> 02:52:27.675]  Planning anything violent?
[02:52:28.455 --> 02:52:30.517]  I'm like, no, I'm just here to cover stuff.
[02:52:30.537 --> 02:52:31.777]  Why don't you knock it off, guys?
[02:52:31.857 --> 02:52:32.838]  Then another one comes up.
[02:52:33.669 --> 02:52:39.450]  That's the one question a lot of people have been asking me, Alex, is ever since you were let loose by immigration at the border, are you being tailed and followed?
[02:52:39.470 --> 02:52:39.650]  Oh, yeah.
[02:52:39.670 --> 02:52:40.310]  I was with Tucker today.
[02:52:40.350 --> 02:52:40.930]  We were being followed.
[02:52:58.809 --> 02:53:06.492]  By vans, by security people taking pictures of us, all sorts of really scary guys with high and tight haircuts, look like special forces.
[02:53:07.372 --> 02:53:08.493]  That's what I wanted to say.
[02:53:09.313 --> 02:53:10.393]  We're just good people.
[02:53:10.453 --> 02:53:11.874]  We know the Bilderberg Group is bad.
[02:53:11.894 --> 02:53:12.914]  We know they do bad things.
[02:53:12.934 --> 02:53:14.095]  We've gotten their corporate minutes.
[02:53:14.675 --> 02:53:16.675]  They're doing bad things to all of us.
[02:53:17.436 --> 02:53:18.536]  They don't like free market.
[02:53:18.576 --> 02:53:19.677]  They don't like sovereignty.
[02:53:20.697 --> 02:53:26.319]  That's what the government people to know out there and those that flagged us as we came in here.
[02:53:27.123 --> 02:53:28.944]  I mean, it is spooky.
[02:53:29.004 --> 02:53:31.105]  I have to tell you, Jack, I don't normally get afraid.
[02:53:31.125 --> 02:53:31.885]  I'm not afraid.
[02:53:32.426 --> 02:53:36.808]  But I just, you know, it's kind of like when a car's driving towards you real fast, walking across a sidewalk.
[02:53:36.868 --> 02:53:37.768]  I feel that chill.
[02:53:38.869 --> 02:53:43.531]  It's weird to know that it was in a bunch of the local papers and national papers here.
[02:53:44.251 --> 02:53:46.272]  And I was like in the front page of one paper.
[02:53:46.292 --> 02:53:48.593]  I know that those are in that hotel right now.
[02:53:48.653 --> 02:53:49.654]  I know the Bilderberg Group.
[02:53:49.694 --> 02:53:50.654]  I know David Rockefeller.
[02:53:50.674 --> 02:53:51.415]  I know Queen Beatrix.
[02:53:51.455 --> 02:53:53.836]  I know others are reading these news articles.
[02:53:54.446 --> 02:53:58.307]  I know they're passing them around because it's got headlines like Secret Rulers Meet.
[02:53:58.367 --> 02:53:59.688]  These are mainstream papers.
[02:54:00.168 --> 02:54:01.208]  Secret of Elite Meeting.
[02:54:02.489 --> 02:54:15.693]  It's spooky to know that I'm sitting here in a city where these people know exactly who I am and they are so hateful and so wicked and that they're looking at a picture of myself and my film crew on the cover of the local paper.
[02:54:17.466 --> 02:54:22.208]  All we're trying to do is... Listen, if you've got 100 football players meeting in secret, people would say, why?
[02:54:22.228 --> 02:54:30.672]  If you've got 100 movie stars meeting in secret and acting weird, or 120, there would be helicopters flying around, people parachuting in and trying to get a story.
[02:54:30.712 --> 02:54:32.113]  The media would be there by the thousands.
[02:54:32.973 --> 02:54:34.454]  This is the elite of the world.
[02:54:34.514 --> 02:54:36.555]  There is a queen there, folks.
[02:54:36.615 --> 02:54:41.157]  The Dutch royalty has almost as much money as the Saxe-Coburg Guthers of England.
[02:54:41.795 --> 02:54:48.760]  But I'm willing to do this and I'm willing to keep going and turning up the heat at every level as we've been doing because I realize that everything hangs in the balance.
[02:54:48.800 --> 02:55:02.131]  These people are psychopathic, they're criminals, they're out of control and I came right up to their cars as they were driving in yesterday and I screamed at them, I'm not your slave, we're not afraid of you, back off your new world order, stop carrying out terror attacks.
[02:55:02.751 --> 02:55:03.972]  I mean, I was letting them know.
[02:55:03.992 --> 02:55:10.597]  Wolftonson, former head of the World Bank, was driving through and his windows were only partially tinted and we got video of him right up in the face and
[02:55:11.027 --> 02:55:12.808]  I told him, I said, we're not your slaves.
[02:55:13.249 --> 02:55:14.089]  Stop what you're doing.
[02:55:14.149 --> 02:55:14.810]  It's wrong.
[02:55:14.870 --> 02:55:15.731]  You know it's wrong.
[02:55:16.211 --> 02:55:17.312]  We know who you are.
[02:55:17.392 --> 02:55:18.273]  We know you're evil.
[02:55:18.613 --> 02:55:20.074]  You're not acting in the dark anymore.
[02:55:20.094 --> 02:55:22.256]  I also called them cockroaches.
[02:55:23.016 --> 02:55:25.098]  Well, look, I mean, you've got to call a spade a spade.
[02:55:25.138 --> 02:55:33.304]  They don't hear that quite enough, and I'm sure it must be quite shocking to them that people are actually standing up to them and actually covering this and daring to expose them.
[02:55:34.781 --> 02:55:38.983]  Well, people like this couldn't operate if the general public wasn't cowed and cowardly.
[02:55:39.303 --> 02:55:44.225]  We've got to find our guts again, find our spines again, and stand up and let the chips fall where they may.
[02:55:44.245 --> 02:55:51.948]  But folks, really should pray for myself and my crew, and pray that God put a hedge of protection around us, because these people are very dangerous, and I've stood up to them in a big way.
[02:55:52.308 --> 02:55:53.228]  Absolutely, yeah.
[02:55:53.348 --> 02:55:56.310]  Please send your good energy up to Alex Jones up in Canada.
[02:55:56.430 --> 02:55:58.190]  Alex, I know we'll hear you back on Monday.
[02:55:58.230 --> 02:56:01.151]  We'll all be waiting for your appearance back at InfoWars Studio.
[02:56:01.472 --> 02:56:02.252]  Be safe, my friend.
[02:56:03.078 --> 02:56:06.902]  You bet, Jack, and you'll be sitting there in a few weeks when I go to LA for that big conference.
[02:56:07.203 --> 02:56:08.244]  Looking forward to it.
[02:56:08.624 --> 02:56:10.967]  All right, watch your back, watch your ass, Alex Jones.
[02:56:11.007 --> 02:56:12.469]  Thank you, folks, for joining us today.
[02:56:12.509 --> 02:56:13.289]  Have a great weekend.
[02:56:13.329 --> 02:56:16.453]  I'll be back in about six minutes with Deadline Live on this very network.
[02:56:16.533 --> 02:56:17.174]  I'm Jack Blood.
[02:56:17.394 --> 02:56:18.876]  Thank you for listening today, folks.
[02:56:19.096 --> 02:56:21.859]  Be bold, and mighty forces will come to your aid.
[02:56:25.911 --> 02:56:26.072]  Hello!
