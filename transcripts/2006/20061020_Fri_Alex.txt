[00:00:05.743 --> 00:00:06.404]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.064 --> 00:00:08.145]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.825 --> 00:00:09.966]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.606 --> 00:00:11.407]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.168 --> 00:00:13.048]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.068 --> 00:00:17.551]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:22.054]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.182]  Well, this entire broadcast today is going to be torture.
[00:00:35.848 --> 00:00:45.914]  Because out of my studio window, I can look out of the office window and just look at the beautiful, perfect ten days we've been having here in Central Texas.
[00:00:45.954 --> 00:00:55.180]  We don't have much of a winter here, but during early fall and then even in spring, it's just a... I don't have words to describe it.
[00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.162]  God's creation is quite beautiful.
[00:00:58.302 --> 00:01:02.245]  I mean, perfect cobalt blue skies, the oak trees,
[00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.042]  Shimmering green like emerald jewels.
[00:01:07.163 --> 00:01:12.466]  But you didn't tune in for my subpar poetry.
[00:01:12.527 --> 00:01:14.928]  You tuned in for news and information.
[00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:21.193]  And I've got a guest coming up in studio in the second hour.
[00:01:22.573 --> 00:01:24.615]  We'll tell you about coming up in the next segment.
[00:01:24.655 --> 00:01:26.156]  But I am going to open the phones up.
[00:01:26.396 --> 00:01:28.958]  I have been doing a little bit better job, as I always say, of taking calls.
[00:01:29.921 --> 00:01:31.943]  And frankly, I usually don't do a very good job of it.
[00:01:32.123 --> 00:01:41.790]  I say I've been doing a better job, which means I've been attempting to go to your calls, attempting to cover the news, attempting to have a lot of important guests on for you.
[00:01:42.851 --> 00:01:47.254]  But we are going to take a bunch of your calls in this first hour today.
[00:01:47.575 --> 00:01:51.438]  It is, of course, open lines.
[00:01:51.538 --> 00:01:53.319]  We do not censor your calls.
[00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:54.700]  I don't care what you call them about.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.081]  You're welcome to get on board.
[00:01:56.942 --> 00:01:58.423]  Just don't use any profanity.
[00:01:59.713 --> 00:02:00.994]  And I guess that's a misstatement.
[00:02:01.734 --> 00:02:04.475]  In a way, there is some screening of calls.
[00:02:04.515 --> 00:02:06.796]  We do ask where you're calling from, how you're listening.
[00:02:08.176 --> 00:02:12.558]  And if you volunteer that you disagree with me, you go to the head of the line.
[00:02:13.458 --> 00:02:15.279]  So if you disagree, you go to the head of the line.
[00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:17.500]  I would also like to hear from first-time callers.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.820]  You will go to the head of the line.
[00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.901]  Please tell us if you're a first-time caller.
[00:02:20.921 --> 00:02:24.262]  And I will take calls in the next segment, if the hair lifts the Admiral.
[00:02:25.006 --> 00:02:27.687]  Come hell or high water and all the other cliches you've heard.
[00:02:27.707 --> 00:02:27.767]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:27.787 --> 00:02:27.948]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:28.188 --> 00:02:31.529]  I love taking calls because you take us in so many different directions.
[00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:37.112]  You never know which news piece you'll bring up, which item, which important analysis that we'll hear from you.
[00:02:47.361 --> 00:02:51.202]  The toll-free number is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:51.223 --> 00:02:52.563]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:52.583 --> 00:02:57.345]  You can talk about North Korea.
[00:02:57.385 --> 00:02:59.106]  You can talk about the state of the economy.
[00:02:59.126 --> 00:03:03.747]  You can talk about what's happening with the North American Union and our borders.
[00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:06.288]  You can talk about Bush signing H.R.
[00:03:06.828 --> 00:03:08.589]  6166, officially overturning the Bill of Rights.
[00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.770]  At least the government thinks they have the power to do that.
[00:03:11.371 --> 00:03:17.536]  You could discuss how face-scanning cameras are going in coast-to-coast from small hamlets to mega-metropolis.
[00:03:18.717 --> 00:03:19.397]  It doesn't matter.
[00:03:19.417 --> 00:03:29.766]  You can talk about how Keith Olbermann is knocking them out of the park over and over again when it comes to pegging this fascista presidencia that we have.
[00:03:31.147 --> 00:03:32.848]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:03:36.727 --> 00:03:38.169]  And boy do I have a stack of news.
[00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.733]  Just to show what a thug gangster Putin is.
[00:03:40.773 --> 00:03:44.578]  You know, Bush is taken to kissing men and women on the lips and on the head in public.
[00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:46.441]  He just doesn't care what people see.
[00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:57.716]  I'm holding hands with Condi at baseball games, but Putin, an alleged Israeli rapist, the president, we all envy him saying, what a powerful man raping ten women.
[00:03:57.756 --> 00:03:58.497]  We all envy him.
[00:03:58.937 --> 00:04:01.859]  And he said this in front of cameras because they were walking into an office.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.341]  This is how they really talk behind closed doors.
[00:04:04.361 --> 00:04:05.662]  I hope you understand that.
[00:04:05.702 --> 00:04:10.305]  It's all gangsterism, all shock, all threats.
[00:04:10.505 --> 00:04:12.467]  It's anything you see on a low level.
[00:04:13.167 --> 00:04:21.214]  Street Thug, or what you see in a classical mafia capo, or Don is what you see from these urchins.
[00:04:23.236 --> 00:04:28.300]  This is from PR News Wire, Amazon's number one nonfiction reviewer.
[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.563]  When Kevin this morning here in the office heard this guy's name, he goes, I know him.
[00:04:33.846 --> 00:04:36.428]  Tarpley's 9-1-1 Synthetic Terror made in the USA.
[00:04:36.588 --> 00:04:40.371]  Strongest of 770 books I've reviewed for Amazon.
[00:04:40.972 --> 00:04:47.917]  And now the former Marine Corps Intelligence Command Officer and CIA Officer goes public and says he believes 9-1-1 is an inside job.
[00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:52.100]  We'll cover this when we get back.
[00:04:52.921 --> 00:04:55.082]  Hallelujah!
[00:04:55.102 --> 00:04:55.683]  I mean it.
[00:04:56.143 --> 00:04:57.004]  Hallelujah!
[00:05:04.475 --> 00:05:07.658]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:08.018 --> 00:05:09.939]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:17.985]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.646 --> 00:05:25.711]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.112 --> 00:05:29.034]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:05:29.434 --> 00:05:31.756]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:05:32.176 --> 00:05:32.997]  NSA spying.
[00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.493]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.814 --> 00:05:41.377]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.797 --> 00:05:43.698]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:47.962]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.343 --> 00:06:06.568]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:06:06.708 --> 00:06:14.815]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:06:15.075 --> 00:06:22.121]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:06:22.261 --> 00:06:22.901]  We're good to go!

[00:08:06.002 --> 00:08:06.642]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.302 --> 00:08:08.362]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.083 --> 00:08:10.183]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.843 --> 00:08:11.644]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.404 --> 00:08:13.424]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.964 --> 00:08:17.646]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.166 --> 00:08:22.227]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:30.573 --> 00:08:53.765]  Amazon.com's biggest non-fiction reviewer, very well known, former CIA officer, analyst, before that he was with the Marine Corps in their intelligence command, has come out and said that he believes 9-11 is an inside job and he
[00:08:55.029 --> 00:09:00.512]  He had basically heard this in the past, done some research, but just couldn't bring himself to believe it.
[00:09:00.532 --> 00:09:23.626]  And he read Webster Tarpley's 9-11 Synthetic Terror made in the USA and went and checked and vetted all the documents and facts and now has concluded in an official Amazon.com review that 9-11 is an inside job and that of the 770 books he's reviewed for Amazon that Synthetic Terror is the best.
[00:09:24.235 --> 00:09:26.896]  And we do carry Synthetic Terror here, by the way.
[00:09:26.916 --> 00:09:41.064]  It is an excellent book to understand how these mole networks work, how there's compartmentalized terror cells within every federal agency, even state police, local police departments, all hooked into the Global Crime Syndicate.
[00:09:41.304 --> 00:09:43.065]  It's MAFIA, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:43.885 --> 00:09:44.906]  Want to know how it works?
[00:09:45.006 --> 00:09:49.188]  I guess go see the new film, The Departed.
[00:09:49.893 --> 00:09:54.957]  The News Corsese film is, by the way, based loosely on real events in Boston.
[00:09:55.558 --> 00:10:03.284]  Just type in FBI informant committing murders for mob, FBI agents committing murders for mob, FBI heads of mob in Chicago.
[00:10:04.204 --> 00:10:10.849]  Heads of Mob in Detroit, Heads of Mob in New York, Heads of Mob in Dallas, Heads of Mob in Boston.
[00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:13.491]  All of that stuff will pop up, but especially in Boston.
[00:10:13.551 --> 00:10:14.952]  I'm just raising that.
[00:10:14.993 --> 00:10:20.217]  I mean, literally folks, the organized crime runs this entire country!
[00:10:23.159 --> 00:10:24.440]  I just keep repeating that.
[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.023]  Because I don't think it's really burned in to people's heads.
[00:10:28.063 --> 00:10:29.584]  And I mean police out there listening.
[00:10:30.456 --> 00:10:37.000]  Yeah, you're out helping little old ladies and you're out at car wrecks on the side of the road risking your life and tromping around in the fire amps.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:37.901]  I understand that.
[00:10:38.742 --> 00:10:42.484]  And you resent the fact when I get up here and say the government's criminal and you work for criminals.
[00:10:42.844 --> 00:10:43.685]  Well, I'm sorry!
[00:10:44.245 --> 00:10:47.347]  Just because you're not a criminal doesn't mean criminals aren't your bosses.
[00:10:47.587 --> 00:10:48.708]  They are your bosses!
[00:10:49.309 --> 00:10:51.610]  I'm talking eight times out of ten, okay?
[00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.712]  Alright, I'm already digressing and I said I'd go to calls in this segment.
[00:10:56.153 --> 00:10:57.374]  I'm just so mad right now.
[00:10:59.053 --> 00:11:00.213]  It just gets worse and worse.
[00:11:03.494 --> 00:11:18.697]  Folks can tell I've been real angry lately and having trouble controlling myself because watching the North American Union get announced in public, having it in mainstream news that the North American Union government met four weeks ago in secret and the press learned of it and it was just on the back of the paper.
[00:11:19.817 --> 00:11:24.578]  Official government meetings, I mean, with the lobbyists writing the new international agreements.
[00:11:25.552 --> 00:11:35.095]  You know, they've signed the agreement setting up the government, now they're just writing whatever laws and sweetheart deals they want, literally carving up our infrastructures.
[00:11:35.155 --> 00:11:46.659]  I mean, we're being totally looted, like when the Nazis took over Czechoslovakia or Poland or... I mean, they just come in and they just pay off a few politicians or put a gun to a few others and just... It's just a mob!
[00:11:46.679 --> 00:11:47.359]  We're being looted!
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.081]  It's never been this bad in our history, I hope you realize that.
[00:11:54.608 --> 00:12:00.992]  And while they're looting you, they're basically pumping the equivalent of morphine into the public.
[00:12:01.553 --> 00:12:11.459]  Basically, the global international crime lords that control our nation are basically like a bunch of vampires chewing our flesh from every angle.
[00:12:11.499 --> 00:12:12.340]  It's like ten of them.
[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:17.844]  Chewing off our toes, chewing off our fingers, chewing off our hands, gnawing on our stomachs.
[00:12:19.305 --> 00:12:20.986]  The whole country is going into shock.
[00:12:21.909 --> 00:12:24.970]  But they're applying morphine into us so we don't feel it.
[00:12:26.091 --> 00:12:28.031]  The country's basically been put under.
[00:12:29.832 --> 00:12:36.115]  And I'm like a little cricket or something jumping around in your chest trying to wake you up.
[00:12:36.275 --> 00:12:37.535]  I'm trying to crawl in your ear.
[00:12:37.595 --> 00:12:40.736]  I'm trying to lift your eyelid open.
[00:12:41.136 --> 00:12:42.437]  But I'm just a little bitty creature.
[00:12:44.821 --> 00:12:48.103]  And I'm watching these vampires literally chew the country to bits.
[00:12:48.143 --> 00:13:01.712]  I mean, before they were just, you know, had an IV in our arms, sucking some blood off, and we got a little bit peak, had a little bit white, a little bit anemic, but I mean, now they've just decided to go whole hog and kill the golden goose because they're criminals and they can't help it.
[00:13:01.732 --> 00:13:02.673]  They've just gone wild!
[00:13:04.254 --> 00:13:05.715]  Their minions have gone wild.
[00:13:07.095 --> 00:13:12.319]  And there is now just a literal frothing, bloody orgy
[00:13:13.243 --> 00:13:26.047]  Like a bunch of wild tigers or lions out on the African plain or the jungles of India just gobbling at the prey that they've felled.
[00:13:26.067 --> 00:13:29.348]  And what is the morphine?
[00:13:29.368 --> 00:13:34.649]  The morphine is Bernanke doubling the money supply in the next two years.
[00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.650]  And that's really in the next year and a half.
[00:13:41.884 --> 00:13:43.345]  Good, there'll be more money.
[00:13:43.485 --> 00:13:44.465]  I like money.
[00:13:44.485 --> 00:13:46.626]  Yeah, you like devalued money.
[00:13:46.867 --> 00:13:47.667]  I guess you do.
[00:13:49.648 --> 00:13:52.749]  And all these giggling, laughing, cynical yuppies.
[00:13:54.130 --> 00:14:01.614]  Because, you know, you can talk to a working man, you can talk to even a wealthy investor, you can talk to a cop, but there are these little giggly-faced
[00:14:03.146 --> 00:14:10.968]  Uh... yuppies who think they're trendy and think they've got control of the world, think they're on top of everything, and they don't want to think that there's some kind of threat to their freedom.
[00:14:11.008 --> 00:14:11.588]  It's scary.
[00:14:11.928 --> 00:14:13.268]  And so they'll just giggle and laugh.
[00:14:13.388 --> 00:14:13.868]  Sure!
[00:14:13.988 --> 00:14:17.609]  Or they'll admit what's going on and go, what are you going to do to stop it?
[00:14:18.209 --> 00:14:18.889]  Hey, punk!
[00:14:19.149 --> 00:14:20.489]  This is real serious!
[00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:26.691]  This is scary, okay?
[00:14:27.791 --> 00:14:28.691]  I'm pretty freaked out.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.361]  All right, let me just read this.
[00:14:32.521 --> 00:14:35.283]  And this isn't just hype by Tar Police Publisher.
[00:14:35.303 --> 00:14:36.384]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[00:14:36.484 --> 00:14:38.766]  And Synthetic Terror is a really good book.
[00:14:38.786 --> 00:14:40.687]  We do carry it again on Infowars.com.
[00:14:41.027 --> 00:14:41.688]  I hope you'll get it.
[00:14:43.689 --> 00:14:51.715]  Amazon's number one non-fiction reviewer, Tar Police 9-1-1 Synthetic Terror made in the USA is the strongest of the 770 books I've reviewed.
[00:14:52.276 --> 00:14:53.697]  Now, why is this important?
[00:14:53.977 --> 00:14:54.377]  It's really a
[00:14:57.003 --> 00:14:59.384]  capillary issue that he's reviewing the book.
[00:14:59.444 --> 00:15:02.045]  The point is that he's now gone public about 9-11.
[00:15:02.986 --> 00:15:12.389]  Reviewer, a former spy and founder of the Marine Corps Intelligence Command, is convinced by Progressive Press' offering that 9-11 was a U.S.-based conspiracy.
[00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:15.751]  Washington, D.C., PR Newswire.
[00:15:17.952 --> 00:15:25.335]  October 18, 2006, Progressive Press announced that its 9-11 synthetic terror has just been cited as the best non-fiction book ever
[00:15:26.132 --> 00:15:35.838]  By Amazon's top non-fiction reviewer, intelligence professional Robert Steele, in a five-star review, and there's a link to the Amazon review.
[00:15:36.898 --> 00:15:37.939]  That's by Amazon.
[00:15:38.179 --> 00:15:40.840]  He's one of their reviewers, not one of the little blurb reviews.
[00:15:41.481 --> 00:15:44.643]  Progressive specializes in books that contend 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:15:44.683 --> 00:15:53.448]  Publisher John Leonard says, in a coup to have Steele, it's a coup to have Steele with us on this, here you have a high-level
[00:15:55.726 --> 00:16:00.288]  Respected insider, lifelong Republican, veteran spy, and he's breaking the taboos.
[00:16:00.709 --> 00:16:05.851]  It's a great tribute and a vindication of the work we put into 9-11 synthetic terror.
[00:16:07.232 --> 00:16:11.955]  Yeah, but if it's a vindication, it's like we were wrong or people attacked us or claimed we were wrong.
[00:16:12.735 --> 00:16:14.116]  Yeah, a bunch of operatives did.
[00:16:14.136 --> 00:16:15.356]  I mean, who cares what they say?
[00:16:16.037 --> 00:16:17.918]  They built straw men to knock them down.
[00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.479]  People find out that trick real quick.
[00:16:19.999 --> 00:16:23.801]  Steele's statement that 9-11 was a U.S.-based conspiracy may be a
[00:16:25.001 --> 00:16:52.849]  from first coming from a senior US intelligence community figure well I don't know about a first we have had Bill Christensen on saying he believes it's an inside job he was a CIA head of an entire department but it continues he came to the conclusion with great sadness quote after reading 9-11 synthetic terror made in the USA which he praised as without question the most important modern reference on state-sponsored terrorism
[00:16:53.971 --> 00:16:56.093]  A unique figure on 9-11 synthetic terror.
[00:16:57.534 --> 00:17:00.377]  He does not blame an entire government or agency.
[00:17:00.757 --> 00:17:09.345]  His rogue network, Mole, features small numbers of moles infesting critical nodes in the key institutions like CIA and mass media.
[00:17:09.906 --> 00:17:11.887]  And it goes on with a Steele's Review.
[00:17:11.907 --> 00:17:14.650]  You can go read his bio too, they have a link there.
[00:17:15.541 --> 00:17:29.171]  So, you know, very senior level when he was in the CIA and other intelligence bodies coming out and saying that it clearly was orchestrated by rogue elements inside Western intelligence centering around the United States.
[00:17:30.813 --> 00:17:32.034]  Okay, let's go to your calls.
[00:17:32.194 --> 00:17:34.615]  We'll get more into this later.
[00:17:36.137 --> 00:17:37.738]  Let's go ahead and talk to
[00:17:39.955 --> 00:17:40.736]  Chris in Illinois.
[00:17:40.756 --> 00:17:41.356]  Go ahead, Chris.
[00:17:41.396 --> 00:17:41.717]  Welcome.
[00:17:42.037 --> 00:17:42.878]  Hi, Alex.
[00:17:42.898 --> 00:17:44.059]  Just a few quick comments.
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:45.901]  What you're saying is so true.
[00:17:45.941 --> 00:17:48.063]  My father worked for the state.
[00:17:48.644 --> 00:17:49.645]  This is 50 years ago.
[00:17:49.945 --> 00:17:51.767]  People knew more about what was going on.
[00:17:52.307 --> 00:17:56.451]  And, you know, there were comments around the kitchen table all the time about corruption.
[00:17:56.892 --> 00:17:58.193]  And, you know, people knew about this.
[00:17:58.273 --> 00:18:00.255]  Nowadays, they're like in La La Land.
[00:18:00.836 --> 00:18:03.598]  But another comment too is... There's no corruption!
[00:18:03.698 --> 00:18:04.759]  Everything's fine!
[00:18:04.819 --> 00:18:06.239]  I'll turn my guns in!
[00:18:06.299 --> 00:18:09.842]  I mean, they knew about stealing votes, like I said, 50, 60 years ago, you know?
[00:18:10.782 --> 00:18:23.070]  Now, another thing too is that it seems that, you know, I've been trying to do some research on the candidates that are running in our county, blah, blah, blah, but everyone connected just about to some form of education system.
[00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:29.274]  Either their wife works for them, or they work for them, or they're endorsed by these educational funds.
[00:18:30.058 --> 00:18:30.778]  It's incredible!
[00:18:31.338 --> 00:18:45.842]  So obviously, you know, this education thing, if the big organizations like, you know, Southern Baptists and so on, if they all pull their kids out of school, it collapses like a house of cards.
[00:18:46.262 --> 00:18:51.884]  But they won't, because most of the denominations are on federal payroll already, totally controlled.
[00:18:52.724 --> 00:18:53.264]  It's sick.
[00:18:53.804 --> 00:18:56.905]  Now, again, you notice how they're pushing this early voting.
[00:18:57.341 --> 00:19:04.954]  Now, we're pretty conservative here in our county, but if you want to vote early, you have to use a die-ball machine.
[00:19:05.481 --> 00:19:06.162]  Well, that's the thing.
[00:19:06.202 --> 00:19:08.343]  A lot of people are saying, vote early, vote early.
[00:19:08.904 --> 00:19:11.105]  I'm not trying to scare people away from that.
[00:19:11.566 --> 00:19:19.772]  I'm not trying to be gloom and doom, but I want to tell these poor folks that in almost every county in the country, they feed the early votes through a computer.
[00:19:20.112 --> 00:19:20.372]  Right.
[00:19:20.632 --> 00:19:23.575]  And that's why, so we're not going to vote early, we're going to vote on the date.
[00:19:23.655 --> 00:19:31.200]  Well, the argument is that at least there is a paper record with the Scantron of how you really voted, but
[00:19:33.721 --> 00:19:37.102]  Again, you have the same county clerks stealing the elections who are in control of those.
[00:19:37.202 --> 00:19:38.403]  It's bad.
[00:19:38.923 --> 00:19:39.763]  It's a bleak picture.
[00:19:40.023 --> 00:19:43.425]  Now, if we could admit how bleak it was, Chris, we could turn this around.
[00:19:43.465 --> 00:19:44.245]  That's what we're doing here.
[00:19:44.265 --> 00:19:53.308]  We're trying to, if words can be found to properly describe it, the nuances of it, describe this horror, so we can all stand together and fight it.
[00:19:53.629 --> 00:19:54.409]  Thanks for the call.
[00:19:54.469 --> 00:19:55.169]  I appreciate it.
[00:19:55.689 --> 00:19:59.691]  David, George, E, Bruce, others, stay with us.
[00:20:01.624 --> 00:20:02.825]  Ted Anderson from Midas.
[00:20:02.865 --> 00:20:04.046]  Today is October 20th, 2006.
[00:20:04.086 --> 00:20:06.529]  Gold opened at $596.40 and one ounce gold coins can be purchased for $628.30.
[00:20:06.569 --> 00:20:08.631]  Again, that's $628.30 to purchase one ounce gold coins.
[00:20:14.508 --> 00:20:17.209]  Do you ever wonder why deficit spending never goes away?
[00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:22.312]  Would you believe me if I told you that fiscal responsibility would lead to a second Great Depression?
[00:20:22.712 --> 00:20:24.093]  Believe it or not, this is true.
[00:20:24.553 --> 00:20:27.715]  Our economy gets its currency from a private banking cartel.
[00:20:28.075 --> 00:20:33.538]  We, the people, labor to create the money only to turn it over to this institution for its seal of approval.
[00:20:33.938 --> 00:20:39.581]  They, in turn, lend it back to us, and we, the people, are forced to labor to service the interest on this debt.
[00:20:40.001 --> 00:20:44.925]  Minus Resources is offering The Creature from Jekyll Island, a second look at the Federal Reserve.
[00:20:45.305 --> 00:20:45.605]  Call 800-686-2237.

[00:20:46.926 --> 00:20:46.986]  800-686-2237.
[00:20:47.046 --> 00:20:49.448]  If you have, pick up a copy for your friend or relative.
[00:20:49.528 --> 00:20:49.849]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.541]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:21:08.041 --> 00:21:10.462]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[00:21:11.242 --> 00:21:19.666]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[00:21:20.626 --> 00:21:25.488]  Now it's cancer's turn to die, with LaysMed Incorporated's patented methodology.

[00:21:36.637 --> 00:21:38.959]  Star War technology at its best.
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:40.961]  For more information, call 702-953-0267.
[00:21:40.981 --> 00:21:41.021]  702-953-0267.
[00:21:49.722 --> 00:21:53.387]  Or visit www.LazMedInc.com.
[00:21:53.707 --> 00:21:57.192]  That's www.LazMedInc.com.
[00:22:02.392 --> 00:22:04.232]  Dad, can we stop?
[00:22:04.573 --> 00:22:06.093]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[00:22:06.513 --> 00:22:06.753]  What?
[00:22:07.113 --> 00:22:07.473]  Again?
[00:22:07.893 --> 00:22:09.514]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[00:22:09.594 --> 00:22:10.594]  Honey, let's stop.
[00:22:10.894 --> 00:22:14.015]  Because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[00:22:14.255 --> 00:22:15.535]  Why did you do that?
[00:22:15.755 --> 00:22:18.036]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time.
[00:22:18.176 --> 00:22:21.537]  And that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[00:22:21.837 --> 00:22:22.857]  Are we there yet?
[00:22:22.977 --> 00:22:24.057]  For the entire trip.
[00:22:24.297 --> 00:22:26.498]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[00:22:26.958 --> 00:22:27.978]  Great idea.
[00:22:28.258 --> 00:22:30.799]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[00:22:31.215 --> 00:22:33.680]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:38.289]  And using our Bertie Sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[00:22:38.549 --> 00:22:38.870]  Honey!
[00:22:39.676 --> 00:22:40.917]  You're terrific!
[00:22:41.317 --> 00:22:42.797]  Oh, honey, so are you!
[00:22:42.917 --> 00:22:46.319]  You're the one that bought the family our Sport Berkey Water Bottles!
[00:22:46.619 --> 00:22:47.399]  Now, can we stop?
[00:22:47.899 --> 00:22:48.620]  I need to go, too.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:53.382]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:22:53.442 --> 00:22:53.642]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:22:53.662 --> 00:22:55.343]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:22:55.383 --> 00:22:57.363]  You know, I really wish I could just power my place with solar.
[00:23:07.376 --> 00:23:13.580]  That's what I was saying to myself over and over again for years until I found out about Ken Solar.
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:20.484]  Ken has been working with solar power for over a decade and has designed systems for people all over the world.
[00:23:20.864 --> 00:23:29.930]  He's put together customized alternative energy packages for everything from powering the local supermarket all the way down to portable solar power generators.
[00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:41.656]  On-grid, off-grid, big systems or tiny systems, Ken has the proven experience to design a tailored alternative energy system that's just right for you and your budget.
[00:23:42.016 --> 00:23:46.298]  He'll also show you how a system can pay for itself in the first month.
[00:23:46.679 --> 00:23:49.480]  So if you're looking for solar, check out KenSolar.

[00:23:58.267 --> 00:23:59.749]  That's KenSolar.com.
[00:24:31.914 --> 00:24:32.615]  Welcome back!
[00:24:34.396 --> 00:24:37.538]  Wide open phones on this live Friday edition.
[00:24:37.558 --> 00:24:41.261]  I'll tell you about our surprise guest, he's going to be in studio coming up a little bit later.
[00:24:41.281 --> 00:24:53.489]  Oh, and by the way, we're scheduled Monday to have Gore Vidal on air with us, the famous author, and who has openly spoken about 9-11 being an inside job, and he was one of the people doing that in the first few months after
[00:24:54.306 --> 00:24:56.807]  He knows a government op when he sees it.
[00:24:57.708 --> 00:25:12.675]  And more on the former marine intelligence officer, former high-level CIA intelligence officer, Republican, going public saying that he believes 9-11 is a U.S.-based inside job conspiracy.
[00:25:14.039 --> 00:25:23.284]  See, more and more problems for the New World Order by the millisecond, because if you really look at the evidence of 9-11 being a false flag event, I don't mean the straw man the media builds up.
[00:25:23.304 --> 00:25:34.711]  You know, the media goes and either covers some kook who's saying 9-11's an inside job with false info, or they go construct things that we've never said or never done and then attribute it to us and then disprove it.
[00:25:35.311 --> 00:25:36.212]  No, I'm not talking about that.
[00:25:36.252 --> 00:25:40.234]  If you go look at the actual evidence, there's no debating it.
[00:25:40.794 --> 00:25:42.135]  You went too far, criminals!
[00:25:43.925 --> 00:25:49.069]  And there's enough of us that know the truth, and we're going to tell the others, and we're going to bring you to justice, you murdering trash.
[00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:51.231]  But let's go to calls right now.
[00:25:51.411 --> 00:25:52.492]  David in Maryland.
[00:25:52.532 --> 00:25:53.212]  David, welcome.
[00:25:55.053 --> 00:25:55.374]  Hi.
[00:25:55.634 --> 00:25:55.954]  Hello.
[00:25:57.275 --> 00:26:02.959]  Yeah, I actually know about what's going on and stuff like that.
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:11.126]  It's just that my family members are actually part of the Illuminati and the Roundtable groups.
[00:26:13.769 --> 00:26:22.193]  You actually have all the presidents that are related to each other and I actually happen to be part of that bloodline also.
[00:26:22.213 --> 00:26:29.717]  It's just that I also understand too that God said, who can make war with a beast?
[00:26:31.258 --> 00:26:34.739]  Yeah, so you're going to tell me to lay down that we can't make war against the beast?
[00:26:37.141 --> 00:26:37.901]  Right.
[00:26:39.662 --> 00:26:41.643]  I'm just saying the beast system is already here.
[00:26:42.402 --> 00:27:02.526]  And I also know about it, too, because I happen to do work for stuff like NSA, AT&T, Bell Atlantic, MCI, Sprint, WorldCom, because I actually happen to be a telecommunications technician.
[00:27:02.926 --> 00:27:04.566]  Sir, you don't sound very credible to me.
[00:27:07.807 --> 00:27:08.947]  Well, that's fine.
[00:27:10.235 --> 00:27:18.477]  Okay, you're in this big powerful Illuminati group, you're in the magical bloodline, and we can't make war against the beast and we should just roll over, huh?
[00:27:19.677 --> 00:27:20.178]  Well, thank you!
[00:27:20.298 --> 00:27:21.818]  Thank you, sir, I appreciate your call.
[00:27:21.838 --> 00:27:22.798]  That's really nice.
[00:27:23.458 --> 00:27:24.779]  It's always nice to hear from you.
[00:27:25.559 --> 00:27:27.959]  And again, that's your phony churches, ladies and gentlemen!
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:33.801]  Can you imagine if they'd have been around in 1776 saying you can't make war against corruption, you can't stand up, you can't be free?
[00:27:34.873 --> 00:27:43.958]  Maybe we should have told the black folks that when they didn't want to be slaves anymore, or didn't want to be segregated anymore, or didn't want to be living out there on the sharecropper farm anymore.
[00:27:44.018 --> 00:27:44.418]  Hey!
[00:27:44.438 --> 00:27:45.258]  You can't make war!
[00:27:45.278 --> 00:27:46.999]  You can't stand up!
[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:49.200]  It's the end of the world!
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:28:00.226]  Of course, people did think that a thousand years ago, even during the Byzantine Empire, where they were killing people, very corrupt, made the Romans look like Sunday school kids.
[00:28:01.279 --> 00:28:06.921]  I mean, the Byzantines were doing a lot of horrible stuff to people, and the Christians then thought, oh, it's the end of the world!
[00:28:07.341 --> 00:28:09.301]  Well, they thought it was the end of the world in Paul's time.
[00:28:09.882 --> 00:28:16.143]  It's always the end of the world, always time to stick your thumb in your mouth and suck on it like a little baby and get in the fetal position.
[00:28:17.344 --> 00:28:21.885]  You know, if you've read the Bible, and if you claim to be a Christian, the whole thing is about standing up against evil.
[00:28:22.896 --> 00:28:23.956]  Duty belongs to us.
[00:28:24.016 --> 00:28:25.217]  Consequence belongs to God.
[00:28:25.257 --> 00:28:32.179]  At the end of the world, next week, like Tim LaHaye says, you made billions of bucks off of you, telling you to lay down, you still should stand up against evil.
[00:28:33.179 --> 00:28:34.980]  So don't go stand up against abortion.
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:37.601]  Just let them kill the babies, because, hell, it's the end anyways.
[00:28:37.861 --> 00:28:40.161]  Go ahead and take your national ID card and your thumbprint.
[00:28:40.201 --> 00:28:40.682]  Don't worry.
[00:28:41.002 --> 00:28:45.503]  Pat Robertson will tell you that it's not the Mark of the Beast and that the microchip... Go ahead and take the chip.
[00:28:45.623 --> 00:28:48.344]  I've got Pat Robertson saying, oh, take the chip.
[00:28:48.364 --> 00:28:49.324]  That's not Mark of the Beast.
[00:28:49.344 --> 00:28:51.805]  You don't want a chip in your body for security.
[00:28:52.998 --> 00:28:53.458]  No, no, no.
[00:28:53.498 --> 00:28:54.538]  That's not it, he says.
[00:28:55.979 --> 00:28:57.179]  Well, what is this system?
[00:28:58.379 --> 00:29:03.220]  So, I really have no use for jellyfish pseudo-Christians.
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:14.722]  I mean, I didn't know that Christians were these pale-skinned, little pencil-necked, limp-wristed cowards.
[00:29:16.722 --> 00:29:17.082]  Okay?
[00:29:17.102 --> 00:29:20.483]  I mean, I didn't know that.
[00:29:22.091 --> 00:29:23.032]  I didn't realize that.
[00:29:24.053 --> 00:29:25.854]  So hell, don't fight the electronic voting.
[00:29:25.874 --> 00:29:27.195]  Don't fight the SPP.
[00:29:27.656 --> 00:29:28.957]  Don't fight them taking your land.
[00:29:28.997 --> 00:29:30.518]  Don't fight them when CPS comes.
[00:29:30.898 --> 00:29:37.104]  I've had so-called Christians on this show and they said if CPS came to take their children, they wouldn't even get in a car and flee.
[00:29:37.684 --> 00:29:38.625]  They wouldn't even run.
[00:29:38.645 --> 00:29:41.848]  They won't even do something that a rat will do.
[00:29:41.908 --> 00:29:43.089]  A rat will fight or run.
[00:29:43.109 --> 00:29:44.230]  A dog will fight or run.
[00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:45.831]  They will just lay there.
[00:29:46.251 --> 00:29:49.314]  Because they are just ugh!
[00:29:51.954 --> 00:29:54.955]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.876 --> 00:29:58.657]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.139 --> 00:30:04.640]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:07.101]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[00:30:07.161 --> 00:30:14.224]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote unquote.
[00:30:14.824 --> 00:30:17.125]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:30:17.785 --> 00:30:21.247]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:30:21.852 --> 00:30:26.014]  The truth is, is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:30:26.574 --> 00:30:29.555]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:30:30.515 --> 00:30:33.436]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:30:34.177 --> 00:30:36.618]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:30:36.658 --> 00:30:40.159]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[00:30:40.179 --> 00:30:40.219]  U.S.
[00:30:40.299 --> 00:30:42.520]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[00:30:52.037 --> 00:30:54.360]  Call 888-XANADU.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:58.586]  That's 888-XANADU.
[00:30:58.926 --> 00:30:59.888]  And ask for George.
[00:31:00.802 --> 00:31:05.884]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:31:05.944 --> 00:31:13.266]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:31:13.406 --> 00:31:24.029]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:28.791]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:31:29.071 --> 00:31:34.056]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[00:31:34.276 --> 00:31:37.218]  Yeah, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:31:37.438 --> 00:31:47.227]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[00:31:47.307 --> 00:31:54.275]  Get a two-pack for only $99 or a four-pack for only $188 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:54.335 --> 00:31:59.781]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:32:00.682 --> 00:32:06.689]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:08.251]  Globalists are concerned with
[00:32:14.025 --> 00:32:14.345]  I think so.
[00:32:38.183 --> 00:32:38.463]  I think so.
[00:33:06.721 --> 00:33:07.642]  I can't back down.
[00:33:07.662 --> 00:33:08.644]  I won't back down.
[00:33:08.664 --> 00:33:10.647]  Thank you again so much for joining us.
[00:33:10.667 --> 00:33:15.896]  I don't want to go off into some frothing, uh, spittle-laced rant.
[00:33:17.238 --> 00:33:19.842]  But it's always the same when these people call in.
[00:33:19.862 --> 00:33:20.804]  I mean, they're always...
[00:33:21.511 --> 00:33:22.852]  I'm not trying to be mean to you, sir.
[00:33:22.912 --> 00:33:26.273]  It's just you sounded like you had your soul sucked out.
[00:33:26.313 --> 00:33:30.495]  Just, uh, like you're barely standing.
[00:33:30.595 --> 00:33:34.257]  I can't stand up against the beast.
[00:33:34.957 --> 00:33:39.019]  You can't make war against it.
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.701]  And I don't know what to say to you.
[00:33:43.622 --> 00:33:45.923]  And I'm sorry if I get disgusted.
[00:33:46.023 --> 00:33:47.463]  I'm sorry if I get angry.
[00:33:47.483 --> 00:33:50.545]  And sit there and tell you what I really think about you.
[00:33:52.441 --> 00:33:57.462]  But if you don't have basic self-preservation instincts, something is wrong with you.
[00:33:58.522 --> 00:33:59.282]  But I know what it is.
[00:33:59.362 --> 00:34:03.223]  Folks, you go to most of these mainline churches, and many of you have heard it yourselves, you've read it yourselves.
[00:34:03.903 --> 00:34:14.306]  It's a religion of feeling good and laying down and being a bunch of sheep, a bunch of cowards, a bunch of just weak people.
[00:34:16.086 --> 00:34:18.946]  And I don't want to even get religious here.
[00:34:18.966 --> 00:34:19.547]  I'm a Christian.
[00:34:19.587 --> 00:34:21.527]  I make no secret of it.
[00:34:23.095 --> 00:34:33.664]  But I almost don't even want to use that word Christian because it's been co-opted today to mean you're George Bush or you're one of these people that says we should lay down to tyranny.
[00:34:35.006 --> 00:34:35.506]  It's sick.
[00:34:36.127 --> 00:34:37.508]  It's so sick.
[00:34:39.009 --> 00:34:39.630]  So fine.
[00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:40.110]  Fine.
[00:34:43.773 --> 00:34:44.534]  Go from us.
[00:34:44.714 --> 00:34:46.035]  Forget that we're your brethren.
[00:34:46.436 --> 00:34:49.719]  May the change that's set upon you ride lightly.
[00:34:51.485 --> 00:34:53.365]  Mayor Change said lightly upon you.
[00:34:54.706 --> 00:34:56.066]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[00:34:56.186 --> 00:34:58.226]  Let's go to George in Arizona.
[00:34:58.286 --> 00:34:59.027]  Thanks for holding.
[00:34:59.307 --> 00:34:59.967]  Welcome, George.
[00:35:00.727 --> 00:35:01.167]  Hi, Alex.
[00:35:01.207 --> 00:35:02.427]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:35:02.507 --> 00:35:04.588]  I kind of got blown away, too, by that guy's comment.
[00:35:04.608 --> 00:35:05.608]  It's a silly comment.
[00:35:05.728 --> 00:35:12.849]  In Luke 11, 21, God says, an armed man is safe in his house and his possessions.
[00:35:13.269 --> 00:35:17.450]  And if you have clothes and you don't have a sword, then sell your clothes and buy a sword.
[00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:19.811]  But let me get to the reason I called.
[00:35:21.543 --> 00:35:26.350]  Um, and where I live in Tucson, the Catholic Church is totally supportive.
[00:35:27.273 --> 00:35:29.875]  Of the Communist Fifth Column Movement.
[00:35:30.435 --> 00:35:31.475]  Yeah, of course they are.
[00:35:31.575 --> 00:35:32.256]  Of course they are.
[00:35:32.656 --> 00:35:37.159]  The Catholic Church has built safe houses all over the Southwest and in Chicago and New York.
[00:35:37.659 --> 00:35:41.521]  And they are pumping in the illegal aliens and using them economically.
[00:35:41.561 --> 00:35:46.023]  They get paid then protection money by the illegals, which then finances the operation.
[00:35:46.043 --> 00:35:47.624]  The Ford Foundation's working to do it.
[00:35:47.944 --> 00:35:49.325]  The federal government's working to do it.
[00:35:49.765 --> 00:35:54.388]  Every major institution of the elite is busy breaking this country asunder.
[00:35:55.888 --> 00:36:10.817]  In 1992, there was a communist uprising in El Salvador, and the people of El Salvador killed five Jesuit priests and a local bishop, and the communist invasion completely collapsed and has not recovered.
[00:36:11.518 --> 00:36:24.265]  Then, the drug dealer in the White House, Oliver North, lost his job, because he needed communist uprising or invasion as a cover for the illegal drug trade.
[00:36:25.769 --> 00:36:35.329]  And that's exactly what I think is happening here, because basically, you know, why would George Bush support all this illegal invasion besides the North American Union?
[00:36:35.785 --> 00:36:37.286]  And that's, you know, to bring in drugs.
[00:36:37.527 --> 00:36:39.468]  And that's what's happening right here in my backyard.
[00:36:39.548 --> 00:36:40.970]  Well, it's more than that.
[00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:53.460]  I mean, it's to drive down the wages, it's to balkanize the people against each other, it's to bankrupt the state governments, and that's what's bankrupting them predominantly, with the health care and the welfare, so the feds can then come in.
[00:36:53.681 --> 00:37:01.948]  It's basically, they want a North American Union, they're going to bring in a client group, already 30 million of them, who believe this is Mexico, so they're going to love the total merger.
[00:37:02.813 --> 00:37:20.746]  You know what, I happened to get a hold of a book called Texas Rangers and the Mexican Revolution, which is right after World War I. Yeah, the plan of San Diego, where they implemented a plan to kill all whites, males, 16 and older, and in one night they killed, what, 22 whites.
[00:37:20.826 --> 00:37:25.229]  It was like helter-skelter type murders, and that's all kept real quiet, yeah.
[00:37:25.249 --> 00:37:30.033]  And that's actually, Hispanics and whites were living together, getting along fine,
[00:37:30.553 --> 00:37:42.799]  And again, over one-third of those in the Revolutionary War for Texas Independence were Hispanic, and the father of Texas who wrote the Constitution was Hispanic, the father of the Texas Constitution, the father, of course, of Sam Houston.
[00:37:43.779 --> 00:37:58.406]  But see, after that happened, that's when a race war started, but the Mexicans first killed a bunch of whites, then they sent in a bunch of Texas Rangers who were really just super hardcore cutthroats from a bunch of foreign wars and mercenaries.
[00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:03.243]  I have an official account of the plight of San Diego.
[00:38:03.423 --> 00:38:08.327]  Item number 7 says, every North American over 16 years of age shall be put to death.
[00:38:09.328 --> 00:38:10.209]  But it's kind of amazing.
[00:38:10.269 --> 00:38:13.632]  I read this book from the standpoint of, I know a little bit about the conspiracy.
[00:38:14.252 --> 00:38:21.138]  And the first chapter of this book about the Texas Rangers says, Colonel Mandrell House and the FBI.
[00:38:21.378 --> 00:38:22.159]  I couldn't believe it!
[00:38:23.345 --> 00:38:26.066]  Yeah, and for those that don't know, he's the one that wanted to get rid of U.S.
[00:38:26.126 --> 00:38:33.310]  sovereignty, and he's the one that is the real father of the Federal Reserve under Woodrow Wilson from their main command base right here in Austin.
[00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:37.112]  Yeah, but I don't look at the Texas Rangers as bad guys.
[00:38:37.132 --> 00:38:41.434]  I look at it as a police force for the Governor of Texas.
[00:38:41.974 --> 00:38:43.915]  No, I'm not knocking the Texas Rangers.
[00:38:43.955 --> 00:38:44.936]  I know all about their history.
[00:38:44.956 --> 00:38:47.117]  We've had famous Texas Rangers, you know, here in studio.
[00:38:47.657 --> 00:38:49.558]  I'm just, you're mentioning House.
[00:38:50.239 --> 00:38:50.879]  Yeah, right.
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:39:03.026]  But my point is that at that time, the FBI was already our enemy who had infiltrated the Texas Rangers to get them to basically let the Mexicans come in.
[00:39:03.066 --> 00:39:10.210]  Because I have photographs of the United States Army officers with all the Mexican bandits, you know, drinking beer together.
[00:39:10.956 --> 00:39:13.659]  And so the plan was back then, and here it is.
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.701]  It just happened to start up again.
[00:39:15.721 --> 00:39:20.106]  I mean, that's what the latest plan is, is invade the United States from Mexico.
[00:39:20.126 --> 00:39:21.868]  And now they're doing it again.
[00:39:21.928 --> 00:39:23.810]  It must be the third or fourth time they did.
[00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:26.433]  No, I hear you, and I appreciate your call.
[00:39:26.954 --> 00:39:27.775]  Good to hear from you.
[00:39:27.835 --> 00:39:28.836]  No, I mean, it's happening.
[00:39:29.719 --> 00:39:32.442]  The globalists will use fascists, they'll use communists.
[00:39:32.502 --> 00:39:38.667]  You know, the communists, leftist bleeding hearts who want to think communism is really of the people and all that.
[00:39:39.088 --> 00:39:41.350]  You're ignoring admitted history, okay?
[00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:48.937]  Now the mainstream glossy history you see on, you know, the nightly news every day is communism was set up in, you know, 1800 and something.
[00:39:51.423 --> 00:40:00.905]  Written up by Marx and Engels, and then they went into Russia and helped set it up, and in 1917 there was the Red Overthrow of the White Russians.
[00:40:02.206 --> 00:40:04.206]  If you go study that, British and U.S.
[00:40:04.266 --> 00:40:05.867]  banks funded the whole thing.
[00:40:06.567 --> 00:40:15.269]  They propped Stalin up during World War II, and our government admits now that they, we always knew this, but now it's admitted, they put Mao in,
[00:40:16.184 --> 00:40:22.710]  And now, conservatively, this is their own numbers, Chinese government says they killed 60 million people.
[00:40:23.071 --> 00:40:23.431]  60 million!
[00:40:23.892 --> 00:40:27.295]  Now a huge sports stadium at a Super Bowl game has 100,000.
[00:40:27.335 --> 00:40:29.597]  How many 100,000's go into 60 million?
[00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:42.517]  Just like they set up Hitler, just like they set up, just like they armed Pakistan, just like they armed North Korea, just like they armed Saddam, it's always the same.
[00:40:42.577 --> 00:40:44.098]  They need chaos.
[00:40:44.639 --> 00:40:48.122]  As Bush looked up in a speech once and said, we need to bring order out of chaos.
[00:40:48.502 --> 00:40:51.325]  Because that's their internal nomenclature.
[00:40:51.785 --> 00:40:53.967]  That's their internal language.
[00:40:54.047 --> 00:40:55.849]  That's, this is what they're doing.
[00:40:56.169 --> 00:40:57.991]  This is how they're operating.
[00:40:59.012 --> 00:41:01.554]  By the way, David Vanoss,
[00:41:02.259 --> 00:41:03.339]  He's going to be joining us.
[00:41:03.399 --> 00:41:21.124]  He's promised to bring criminal charges against those involved in the Trans-Texas Corridor that is a segment, a member, an organ of the Trans-Nefta highways that are the funding mechanism, the chief funding mechanism for the new North American Union government.
[00:41:21.504 --> 00:41:23.625]  He's running for Attorney General as a Democrat.
[00:41:23.645 --> 00:41:25.245]  He is the Democratic candidate.
[00:41:25.686 --> 00:41:27.306]  He has a good chance of winning.
[00:41:28.806 --> 00:41:30.807]  When you understand that, folks, he's going to be in studio
[00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:44.983]  Coming up with us, David Van Oss will be joining us, coming up in the next hour, talking about the NAFTA superhighways, the North American Union.
[00:41:46.825 --> 00:41:48.206]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[00:41:48.246 --> 00:41:50.649]  Let's go ahead and talk to E in Texas.
[00:41:50.849 --> 00:41:51.529]  E, you're on the air.
[00:41:51.549 --> 00:41:51.930]  Go ahead.
[00:41:52.811 --> 00:41:54.212]  Hi Alex, it's great to talk to you.
[00:41:54.392 --> 00:41:54.993]  Good to talk to you.
[00:41:55.936 --> 00:42:01.879]  Hey, uh, I do a lot of service work for what you call the neocon organization, but I'm what I call the snake in the grass.
[00:42:01.959 --> 00:42:03.079]  I'm the one that can't turn.
[00:42:03.099 --> 00:42:05.300]  The new Austin SWAT truck.
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:07.982]  It actually looks like it came out of the military.
[00:42:08.042 --> 00:42:12.704]  Military green, 10 tons, and from what I was told they paid over a half a million for this.
[00:42:14.062 --> 00:42:17.603]  Well, they've got to have their big armored vehicles when they confiscate guns.
[00:42:17.643 --> 00:42:18.903]  And we always said they do it.
[00:42:18.943 --> 00:42:22.744]  We had PDD 25 and it's admitted now it's been in the news.
[00:42:23.184 --> 00:42:24.164]  But look at New Orleans.
[00:42:24.184 --> 00:42:26.084]  They didn't bring food and water even a week after.
[00:42:26.104 --> 00:42:27.625]  They went into the rich neighborhoods.
[00:42:28.265 --> 00:42:29.665]  And my point is, nobody's safe.
[00:42:29.725 --> 00:42:31.446]  I mean, $5 billion.
[00:42:31.466 --> 00:42:32.406]  It had to be more than that.
[00:42:32.446 --> 00:42:36.867]  I mean, houses that look like, you know, the Capitol building or something.
[00:42:36.887 --> 00:42:37.427]  They're huge.
[00:42:37.827 --> 00:42:38.867]  Or the Supreme Court building.
[00:42:39.207 --> 00:42:42.788]  And they went in and took people's guns and then laughed about it, led by the FBI.
[00:42:44.136 --> 00:42:47.917]  That whole thing was a war-fighting laboratory out to take our guns, but go ahead.
[00:42:48.997 --> 00:42:53.259]  Well, I just wanted to tell you thank you for opening my eyes up and disconnecting me from the Matrix.
[00:42:53.519 --> 00:42:56.080]  I am a first-time caller and one heck of a long-time listener.
[00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:57.720]  I did finally get to meet Mr. Dacey.
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:02.762]  Uh, he, uh, hosts the PYU up in, uh, New York during the, uh, September 11th conference.
[00:43:02.782 --> 00:43:03.642]  Sure, Bob's a good guy.
[00:43:04.282 --> 00:43:05.362]  Well, listen, you called in.
[00:43:05.382 --> 00:43:07.043]  What did you, uh, what did you call in about?
[00:43:07.083 --> 00:43:08.323]  Tell us, uh, tell us your point.
[00:43:08.343 --> 00:43:09.284]  About the SWAT trucks.
[00:43:09.584 --> 00:43:11.024]  About the trucks that I was telling you about.
[00:43:11.044 --> 00:43:13.645]  The new, uh, military look that our police department has.
[00:43:14.289 --> 00:43:15.571]  Sure, how many trucks did they get?
[00:43:16.512 --> 00:43:19.035]  Well, they've got one new one and they've got three old ones.
[00:43:20.737 --> 00:43:23.961]  And, uh, but this is one that looks like it came right off of military force.
[00:43:25.643 --> 00:43:26.945]  I mean, straight military.
[00:43:28.664 --> 00:43:36.570]  I just want the SWAT team to know most of what they do is completely worthless and nothing but a risk to their lives and our lives.
[00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:44.956]  The government and allied crime syndicates bring in and license over 90% of the narcotics that enter this country.
[00:43:45.576 --> 00:43:50.119]  And then I know there's a lot of dirt involved in the drug underworld because it is illegal.
[00:43:50.479 --> 00:43:53.020]  That does make slimeballs gravitate towards it.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:44:02.845]  So all the horrible stuff they see in those apartments and those houses and those deals, you know, that would all evaporate, dissipate the minute they decriminalize drugs.
[00:44:03.206 --> 00:44:04.146]  And they've done it in Europe.
[00:44:04.446 --> 00:44:06.267]  England decriminalized marijuana.
[00:44:06.387 --> 00:44:10.589]  I've seen people smoke pot right in front of police in London, right in front of the Parliament.
[00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:11.450]  They do nothing.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.802]  That's because it's basically been decriminalized.
[00:44:13.822 --> 00:44:14.903]  It's like a slap on the wrist.
[00:44:15.463 --> 00:44:16.224]  And guess what?
[00:44:16.684 --> 00:44:25.072]  It just came out, BBC and other news reports last week, well actually Monday I covered it, that marijuana use has dropped by a third in five years.
[00:44:25.493 --> 00:44:29.537]  Because it isn't cool anymore, there's no market to bring it in because it's not illegal.
[00:44:31.178 --> 00:44:32.039]  So there you have it.
[00:44:32.549 --> 00:44:33.529]  And it's the same thing.
[00:44:34.029 --> 00:44:42.071]  And so I just want you to know, you know, you're all into being tough and into adrenaline and you've got the highest rates of suicide, alcoholism, family violence.
[00:44:42.611 --> 00:44:44.552]  You know, why don't you repent and come to Jesus?
[00:44:44.912 --> 00:44:47.432]  And why don't you stop waging war against the American people?
[00:44:47.712 --> 00:44:49.373]  You want to go join the French Foreign Legion?
[00:44:49.413 --> 00:44:54.154]  You can go to Africa and fight right now with real men that have real guns that will shoot back at you.
[00:44:54.554 --> 00:44:55.574]  You want to be real men?
[00:44:55.594 --> 00:44:58.795]  I know a lot of you washed out of the military, washed out of special ops.
[00:44:59.115 --> 00:45:00.495]  You've got this Rambo idea.
[00:45:00.935 --> 00:45:09.737]  Why don't you go be real men and why don't you go join the Peace Corps and go let mosquitoes bite you and live in the swamps?
[00:45:10.158 --> 00:45:11.638]  And then you can even have folks shoot at you.
[00:45:11.898 --> 00:45:12.798]  I'm sorry, go ahead, caller.
[00:45:13.898 --> 00:45:14.899]  It's not a problem, Alex.
[00:45:14.999 --> 00:45:20.140]  I'm just laughing because I listen to you every day and I agree with you 100% the way their system is.
[00:45:21.650 --> 00:45:24.711]  And I will go and buy Terror Storm from Mr. Dacey.
[00:45:25.211 --> 00:45:28.792]  I found out where I could get that, and they keep up the good fight, brother.
[00:45:29.012 --> 00:45:29.772]  Well, thank you.
[00:45:29.892 --> 00:45:32.092]  Yes, there's two places to get my videos.
[00:45:32.192 --> 00:45:37.994]  They carry all of my videos at Brave New Books in downtown Austin, and then at the Hardware Store, Incorporated.
[00:45:38.074 --> 00:45:40.554]  It's really shells, guns, preparedness outfit, too.
[00:45:41.114 --> 00:45:43.155]  It's a nice little family hardware store, pretty good size.
[00:45:43.615 --> 00:45:44.975]  It's up in Spicewood Springs and 183.
[00:45:45.015 --> 00:45:46.255]  You can get all my films there.
[00:45:46.295 --> 00:45:47.676]  Bob Dacey's a pleasure.
[00:45:48.096 --> 00:45:48.836]  He's a writer for them.
[00:45:49.921 --> 00:45:56.129]  Free American or New American Magazine and the John Birch folks and he also has a TV show here locally and a good friend of mine.
[00:45:56.990 --> 00:46:02.416]  And one of my converts ten years ago who has now become a great fighter against the New World Order.
[00:46:03.057 --> 00:46:07.242]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bruce in New York.
[00:46:07.262 --> 00:46:07.883]  Go ahead Bruce.
[00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:09.410]  Hey, Alex.
[00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:17.853]  You and I met in New York on September 10th, and we took a train together with your team to Cooper Union.
[00:46:17.893 --> 00:46:19.333]  It was great meeting you, for the record.
[00:46:19.893 --> 00:46:22.694]  I find you intense, passionate, but not arrogant.
[00:46:23.754 --> 00:46:24.935]  I have a couple questions for you.
[00:46:25.555 --> 00:46:26.015]  Well, thank you.
[00:46:26.035 --> 00:46:26.735]  Go ahead.
[00:46:27.556 --> 00:46:32.057]  What's up and what's happening right now with Jack Cafferty and Keith Oakerman?
[00:46:32.097 --> 00:46:32.917]  What's up with them?
[00:46:33.197 --> 00:46:35.938]  Why, all of a sudden, are they being so loud?
[00:46:36.707 --> 00:46:39.288]  Uh, given that they work for CNN, MSNBC.
[00:46:40.829 --> 00:47:00.420]  Well, I haven't been watching, uh, the other fella as much as I should, but I know that Keith Oberman, I know a TV, actually I know two former TV broadcasters, well actually one of them is still current, but they formerly worked with Keith Oberman, uh, on the West Coast, and they say he's very smart,
[00:47:01.227 --> 00:47:12.454]  Libertarian-minded, he's a really nice guy, and he was with ESPN and then he went to MSNBC, and he basically has been kept on a short leash.
[00:47:13.034 --> 00:47:16.136]  Now MSNBC is allowing him to go wild.
[00:47:17.657 --> 00:47:23.641]  Of course, we've got major defense contractors and General Electric that own controlling stock in NBC.
[00:47:24.927 --> 00:47:31.113]  So why is MSNBC, a partnership between Microsoft and NBC, allowing him to do that?
[00:47:31.774 --> 00:47:41.884]  And a lot of people think it's because there's large segments of the elite, around 65% of the Bilderberg Group now, think the neocons are moving too fast, endangering the whole apple cart.
[00:47:42.905 --> 00:47:48.270]  And at the same time, the elite have to also allow some of their people to put out the illusion
[00:47:49.096 --> 00:47:54.040]  I meant to say this yesterday about Oberman, but I ran out of time when I played that last clip, but I believe Oberman is a good guy.
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:48:09.212]  I believe Lou Dobbs is good, but they're only allowed to go so far to then still give the illusion of choice, the illusion of freedom, one of the reasons I'm left alive, basically, or not in prison or set up, and the reason they're allowed to continue doing what they do.
[00:48:09.272 --> 00:48:15.237]  And then number two, it also gets ratings, because any liberal, fake liberal stuff doesn't sell anymore.
[00:48:15.657 --> 00:48:17.519]  Fake conservative stuff doesn't sell anymore.
[00:48:17.539 --> 00:48:18.580]  I mean, I have a poll where
[00:48:19.392 --> 00:48:32.702]  Another scientific poll, 16% of Wall Street Journal, ABC poll, heck I have it right here in the stack, let me dig it out, where only 16% have a good approval of the Congress.
[00:48:33.022 --> 00:48:34.683]  And that goes for Democrats and Republicans.
[00:48:34.723 --> 00:48:39.206]  You see, for the first time in modern history, the American people don't trust anyone.
[00:48:39.867 --> 00:48:41.468]  And that's because the paradigm shifted.
[00:48:42.068 --> 00:48:47.232]  And so you're going to see more and more of the media trying to stay in the game, trying to stay pertinent,
[00:48:47.808 --> 00:48:50.151]  Another question for you, Alex?
[00:49:08.018 --> 00:49:13.063]  What's up with the rumors of Bush, Papa and Son buying property in Paraguay?
[00:49:13.684 --> 00:49:20.712]  Well, it looks like they did in some deal with the Moonies, but these people can leverage trillions.
[00:49:20.812 --> 00:49:22.655]  The Bushes are a high-level servant family.
[00:49:23.275 --> 00:49:26.156]  The Rockefellers, who then in tune worked for the Rothschilds.
[00:49:26.556 --> 00:49:32.199]  The Bushes own triple whole super tankers, controlling stock in three private prison companies.
[00:49:32.899 --> 00:49:35.760]  They sit on the boards of, last time I read, hundreds of banks.
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:38.881]  They are a mafia, 98% of their money hidden.
[00:49:39.282 --> 00:49:42.323]  They own, I mean, they're just so opulently wealthy, it's a joke.
[00:49:42.683 --> 00:49:46.244]  They got the secret war chest, this was in mainstream news in 49,
[00:49:47.925 --> 00:50:03.074]  The secret war chest of almost the entire Nazi fortune through Switzerland and through Argentina and through Venezuela and a few other places where the Nazis went, Guatemala, El Salvador, their wealth is untold.
[00:50:04.094 --> 00:50:11.899]  They were the bankers and when the Nazis got most of their money out, they managed the money for tens of thousands of top Nazis that went to Latin America.
[00:50:13.069 --> 00:50:13.429]  Gotcha.
[00:50:13.809 --> 00:50:17.031]  And you talked about a month or so ago about doing a show.
[00:50:17.051 --> 00:50:22.474]  We're talking about emergency preparedness and supplies we should have on hand just in case.
[00:50:22.594 --> 00:50:25.615]  Are you going to be doing anything with that and is that something you could approach?
[00:50:26.496 --> 00:50:26.756]  Sure.
[00:50:26.816 --> 00:50:27.816]  Are you sure it was this show?
[00:50:27.836 --> 00:50:28.737]  You heard me talk about that?
[00:50:29.257 --> 00:50:29.757]  Yeah.
[00:50:29.837 --> 00:50:38.762]  One of your water filtered guys, you said something like, I should do a show about this because there are things we could do in an emergency situation.
[00:50:39.409 --> 00:50:40.972]  Well, sounds like I should do that.
[00:50:40.992 --> 00:50:41.853]  There's a lot I should do.
[00:50:42.254 --> 00:50:43.035]  Thank you for the call.
[00:50:43.096 --> 00:50:44.478]  Nice meeting you in New York.
[00:50:45.419 --> 00:50:48.064]  We'll talk to many others on the other side of this.
[00:50:48.164 --> 00:50:48.645]  Quick break.
[00:50:49.166 --> 00:50:49.486]  Stay with us.
[00:50:56.445 --> 00:50:59.606]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:50:59.967 --> 00:51:01.867]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:02.247 --> 00:51:09.931]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:10.591 --> 00:51:17.654]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:18.054 --> 00:51:24.937]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:51:25.413 --> 00:51:29.476]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:29.777 --> 00:51:33.319]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:35.681]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:36.002 --> 00:51:39.925]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:51:53.397 --> 00:51:58.362]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[00:51:58.682 --> 00:52:04.107]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.

[00:53:59.372 --> 00:54:02.534]  They say the truth is stranger than fiction, and it really is.
[00:54:03.555 --> 00:54:10.660]  To think that the Bushes were on the board of Brown Brother Harriman, that is Prescott Bush, who later became a U.S.
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:11.100]  Senator.
[00:54:12.998 --> 00:54:18.602]  To think that they were on the board of the major Nazi front in the U.S.
[00:54:18.682 --> 00:54:29.569]  cited in congressional hearings, people were arrested on the board, the owner of the bank was of course indicted and had to flee and had some of his assets taken to the bushes.
[00:54:30.589 --> 00:54:36.353]  Grandfather, the former president's father, was actually indicted and got swept under the rug.
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:45.225]  He has set up the USO just a few weeks before he did get indicted, because that was a great PR coup.
[00:54:45.305 --> 00:54:48.647]  Oh, he's the guy that brings entertainment to the troops.
[00:54:48.908 --> 00:54:49.988]  Oh, he's patriotic.
[00:54:50.989 --> 00:54:52.250]  Top Nazi agents.
[00:54:52.410 --> 00:55:01.216]  And then after the war, and it came out in major papers, the Nazis needed still-injured agents with their hundreds of billions of dollars.
[00:55:01.256 --> 00:55:05.980]  I mean, literal trainloads and boatloads of diamonds and gold and artwork.
[00:55:06.596 --> 00:55:07.977]  To be fenced through the U.S.
[00:55:08.157 --> 00:55:09.157]  and the O.S.S.
[00:55:10.358 --> 00:55:18.823]  and a large group of people in our government were more than happy to get large portions of that money in turn for protecting the Nazis and a lot of them even got U.S.
[00:55:18.843 --> 00:55:29.949]  government jobs and their major institutions and colleges and federal buildings named after people who were, some of them, you know, Deputy Bureau in the chain of command.
[00:55:30.029 --> 00:55:34.291]  I mean, it's unbelievable, folks, when you start learning
[00:55:36.211 --> 00:55:46.354]  That this type of stuff is, and by Deputy Fuhrer, they had a whole sub-designate group of Gruppenfuhrers and all these different terrorists, but I mean in the upper echelon of the Nazis.
[00:55:47.074 --> 00:55:57.656]  And when you really think about it, I wouldn't say the Nazis, everybody's heard that rumor, the Nazis had a secret plan to take over after the war with all their gold, but it failed.
[00:55:57.676 --> 00:56:03.898]  I wouldn't even say the Nazis did, just more the fascist mindset and that money with the Nazis.
[00:56:04.731 --> 00:56:09.775]  Helped form and fund a lot of the New World Order operations we see today.
[00:56:11.617 --> 00:56:19.443]  It's like the founder of the Bilderberg Group in 1954, Prince Bernhardt, later King of the Netherlands, literally owns Dutch Rochelle, literally one of the richest men in the world.
[00:56:19.823 --> 00:56:22.105]  His daughter now is one of the heads of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:56:22.125 --> 00:56:23.286]  We videotaped her in Ottawa.
[00:56:24.047 --> 00:56:26.389]  And he was a SS full colonel.
[00:56:26.589 --> 00:56:29.571]  That's the equivalent of a two-star general in the SS.
[00:56:29.591 --> 00:56:33.134]  They had very few... It was a different system.
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:38.381]  But this is how they operate.
[00:56:38.421 --> 00:56:39.361]  This is what they do.
[00:56:40.441 --> 00:56:41.601]  And they're into eugenics.
[00:56:41.641 --> 00:56:42.442]  They're into breeding.
[00:56:42.462 --> 00:56:43.302]  They're into control.
[00:56:43.322 --> 00:56:44.382]  They're into extermination.
[00:56:44.402 --> 00:56:45.422]  They're totally ruthless.
[00:56:46.222 --> 00:56:48.243]  And they're in control of America today.
[00:56:49.023 --> 00:56:52.204]  The grandson of the top Nazi agent in the U.S.
[00:56:52.364 --> 00:56:53.104]  is our president.
[00:56:53.984 --> 00:56:57.525]  And so is there any surprise our police wear black uniforms and drive armored vehicles?
[00:56:57.925 --> 00:57:01.766]  Is there any surprise that the Homeland Security seal looks like a Nazi signet?
[00:57:02.398 --> 00:57:05.759]  Is there any surprise that they've put up these symbols of fascism in the Senate?
[00:57:06.899 --> 00:57:09.300]  Yeah, it's been there, what, since the fifties?
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:12.841]  The fascist symbol is the bundle of sticks with the hatchet heads on them.
[00:57:13.141 --> 00:57:15.022]  I mean, they're not playing games!
[00:57:15.542 --> 00:57:16.743]  I hope you realize that.
[00:57:17.503 --> 00:57:21.284]  And they staged terror attacks, just like Hitler did, against their own people.
[00:57:21.784 --> 00:57:23.705]  I mean, they're following the exact same playbook.
[00:57:24.385 --> 00:57:25.825]  And they mean business.
[00:57:26.206 --> 00:57:27.186]  Oh, they mean business.
[00:57:27.586 --> 00:57:30.787]  And again, they work with the same Nazi agents, the Muslim Brotherhood.
[00:57:32.259 --> 00:57:35.140]  The Wahhabis who worked with the Nazis during World War II.
[00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:35.540]  Boom!
[00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:38.802]  Those very same contacts handed over by the SS to British and US intel.
[00:57:38.842 --> 00:57:41.243]  They went in and took over the radical Muslims right after that.
[00:57:41.643 --> 00:57:46.745]  Used them to overthrow countries that were pro-US and sovereign and building up first world systems.
[00:57:46.785 --> 00:57:47.545]  They didn't want that.
[00:57:48.306 --> 00:57:51.747]  They used the Wahhabis to overthrow in Iran and put in the Shah.
[00:57:52.447 --> 00:57:53.288]  It's the same thing.
[00:57:53.328 --> 00:57:54.828]  I mean, it's literally the same crew.
[00:57:55.069 --> 00:57:56.369]  They're a hardcore mafia.
[00:57:57.350 --> 00:57:58.230]  They've got the will.
[00:57:59.309 --> 00:58:01.370]  They know we're naive and they're moving on us.
[00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:02.130]  Moving bad.
[00:58:02.770 --> 00:58:05.831]  It isn't enough to not own all the banks and the defense contractors and the media.
[00:58:06.351 --> 00:58:08.112]  They want to own everything and run everything.
[00:58:09.252 --> 00:58:11.313]  And they're changing all the laws and the court rulings.
[00:58:11.953 --> 00:58:14.854]  The entire America we knew is being removed right now.
[00:58:16.134 --> 00:58:18.135]  And it's going to get worse and worse.
[00:58:18.195 --> 00:58:19.615]  It's going to get more and more hardcore.
[00:58:20.316 --> 00:58:21.376]  Hope you enjoy it, America.
[00:58:22.290 --> 00:58:22.530]  Really?
[00:58:22.651 --> 00:58:23.852]  I mean, you wanted to be a slave?
[00:58:23.892 --> 00:58:24.773]  You're gonna get to be one.
[00:58:25.254 --> 00:58:27.516]  Unless we turn around and fight these bastards.
[00:58:28.097 --> 00:58:29.879]  Are Americans still Americans?
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:31.001]  Can we whoop them?
[00:58:32.983 --> 00:58:37.889]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:50.160]  Big Brother.
[00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:51.880]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:52.601 --> 00:58:53.701]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:54.361 --> 00:58:55.161]  You want answers?
[00:58:55.942 --> 00:58:56.802]  Well, so does he.
[00:58:56.822 --> 00:59:01.143]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:01.663 --> 00:59:05.805]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:11.907 --> 00:59:13.347]  Coming up in the next segment,
[00:59:14.384 --> 00:59:18.608]  We've got David Van Os, running for Texas Attorney General, in studio with us.
[00:59:18.628 --> 00:59:20.089]  We're really honored to have him.
[00:59:20.109 --> 00:59:24.813]  We'll tell you all about him and his affidavits he's filed, the work he's done.
[00:59:24.873 --> 00:59:32.540]  He's saying he's going to go after the criminals that are pushing this trans-Texas corridor, which is, again, just a unit of the entire NAFTA system.
[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:37.524]  They're going to use this for the taxing mechanism, the central taxing mechanism.
[00:59:37.544 --> 00:59:39.126]  In fact, I've got his poster here.
[00:59:40.044 --> 00:59:41.344]  This is his campaign slogan.
[00:59:41.384 --> 00:59:43.805]  Notice the big oil, I'm coming after you.
[00:59:43.885 --> 00:59:45.465]  So, he'll be coming up in a few minutes.
[00:59:46.225 --> 00:59:58.768]  We, of course, mentioned in the first hour, I will detail it more later, that a senior Marine Corps intelligence officer, then a senior CIA analyst and counter-terrorism expert has gone public.
[00:59:58.848 --> 01:00:02.489]  Another individual has gone public saying that he believes 9-11 is an inside job.
[01:00:06.090 --> 01:00:07.371]  I want to cover that.
[01:00:07.671 --> 01:00:12.536]  Also, it's in CNN and other reports, buried in plain view, that as we told you it would be.
[01:00:12.857 --> 01:00:15.940]  Remember, three or four months ago, there was the Canadian terror plot.
[01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:20.064]  It was a bunch of 18-year-old kids, got tons of fertilizer delivered to their house, and they busted them.
[01:00:20.425 --> 01:00:22.607]  Turned out the group was led and provocateured
[01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:27.223]  By Royal Mounted Police inside the group who were commanding it.
[01:00:27.243 --> 01:00:44.118]  Remember three weeks ago I had former head British commandos and heads of IRA operations and they told you on air, this has now been admitted even in the BBC, that the IRA from the 70s into 2000 was run by British Intelligence and that's when you had the most bombings.
[01:00:44.158 --> 01:00:45.119]  It was British Intelligence
[01:00:45.899 --> 01:00:49.001]  Leading the IRA, commanding the bombings.
[01:00:49.041 --> 01:00:50.741]  That's not debatable now.
[01:00:50.781 --> 01:00:51.682]  That is irrefutable.
[01:00:51.922 --> 01:00:52.482]  That makes sense.
[01:00:52.742 --> 01:00:54.783]  Who gets to keep troops in Northern Ireland?
[01:00:54.803 --> 01:00:56.724]  Who gets to have a police state in England and London?
[01:00:57.064 --> 01:00:59.145]  Who gets to grandstand and take people's freedoms?
[01:00:59.585 --> 01:01:02.546]  Again, just like Hitler staged terror, the British do it.
[01:01:04.747 --> 01:01:09.789]  I guess to the credit of Canada, they're only provocateuring it.
[01:01:11.099 --> 01:01:12.960]  Which is kind of like a hyper sting.
[01:01:13.541 --> 01:01:18.405]  Stings or entrapment are one thing where you go and go, don't you want some cocaine?
[01:01:18.425 --> 01:01:19.586]  Don't you want to buy some cocaine?
[01:01:19.626 --> 01:01:26.192]  Or hey, don't you want to buy some illegal microchips that can be used in missiles?
[01:01:27.013 --> 01:01:31.077]  And that's questionable and was thought of as dirty in the past.
[01:01:31.397 --> 01:01:34.200]  But when you go out, well remember a few months ago in Miami.
[01:01:34.995 --> 01:01:37.219]  Eighteen-year-old street kids profiled.
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:38.782]  FBI went and founded the group.
[01:01:38.802 --> 01:01:41.767]  They actually went and found street kids out of the blue and led it.
[01:01:42.188 --> 01:01:42.489]  Think about it.
[01:01:42.509 --> 01:01:46.296]  If I was an FBI agent, or you were an FBI agent, and you went out
[01:01:47.233 --> 01:01:54.579]  And literally hired homeless people and gave them bottles of whiskey to just, and it took you a year to do this, to finally get them to shoot their mouths off.
[01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:59.984]  And they paid the kids down who were smoking pot and drinking, and they were given money for drugs.
[01:02:00.744 --> 01:02:12.514]  I mean, who couldn't in just a few weeks, much less a year, go recruit people, have a warehouse, and have street kids and bums swaggering around drunk talking about how they're going to blow up the federal building in Miami.
[01:02:13.519 --> 01:02:15.840]  And that is admittedly what happened.
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:18.581]  So I commend the FBI and a well amount of police.
[01:02:18.621 --> 01:02:31.345]  At least you're not doing like you did in 1993 where the FBI cooked the bomb, trained the driver, and got these Muslim extremists to go park it there in the basement of one of the World Trade Center towers.
[01:02:31.897 --> 01:02:35.659]  You know, at least you're just provocateuring and out trying to get people to do it.
[01:02:35.679 --> 01:02:39.462]  At least you're not, you know, cooking the bomb and training the driver like you've done in the past.
[01:02:39.902 --> 01:02:44.925]  So, we'll be going over that in the third hour today and we will continue to have open phones.
[01:02:45.305 --> 01:02:50.148]  In fact, later we'll give our guest a headset so we can take some calls.
[01:02:51.328 --> 01:02:53.510]  There's also some other news on 9-11.
[01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:55.191]  This is a 9-11 blogger.
[01:02:55.291 --> 01:02:59.333]  Oklahoma newspapers to run 9-11 truth ads.
[01:02:59.613 --> 01:03:00.534]  So that's exciting.
[01:03:01.488 --> 01:03:03.248]  Putin is showing what a gangster he is.
[01:03:04.449 --> 01:03:09.470]  He's taken to kissing children on the lips he doesn't know in public.
[01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:10.890]  Little boys.
[01:03:11.030 --> 01:03:15.911]  He's taken to shooting his mouth off about how reporters will disappear, and then they do.
[01:03:16.691 --> 01:03:21.092]  Well, now, this is out of the Jerusalem Post.
[01:03:22.253 --> 01:03:24.013]  It's also out of the Associated Press.
[01:03:24.333 --> 01:03:27.674]  Putin joked in front of cameras and said, hell, you've raped ten women.
[01:03:28.889 --> 01:03:30.631]  You know, we're all envying you.
[01:03:30.671 --> 01:03:31.532]  That's pretty good.
[01:03:31.552 --> 01:03:34.896]  I mean, I actually have his quotes here.
[01:03:34.977 --> 01:03:37.119]  So, again, they're getting so gangster.
[01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:41.685]  He meets with Olmert, the Prime Minister of... Well, we'll tell you about it coming up.
[01:03:41.745 --> 01:03:42.806]  It's just these people are criminals.
[01:03:43.106 --> 01:03:43.727]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:48.453 --> 01:03:51.654]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:03:51.995 --> 01:03:53.935]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:03:54.295 --> 01:04:01.959]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:02.639 --> 01:04:09.682]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:10.082 --> 01:04:13.023]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:04:13.423 --> 01:04:15.744]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:04:16.165 --> 01:04:16.945]  NSA spying.

[01:04:21.824 --> 01:04:25.466]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.

[01:04:45.225 --> 01:04:46.005]  Terrorism!
[01:04:46.145 --> 01:04:46.905]  Terrorism!
[01:04:47.005 --> 01:04:53.047]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:04:53.327 --> 01:04:54.907]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:04:55.147 --> 01:04:57.628]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:04:58.028 --> 01:05:12.591]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:12.631 --> 01:05:12.951]  government.

[01:05:50.819 --> 01:05:53.023]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for
[01:05:56.516 --> 01:05:57.016]  We're good to go.

[01:06:53.859 --> 01:06:57.722]  This is not America.
[01:06:57.862 --> 01:07:00.964]  Sha-la-la-la-la.
[01:07:01.304 --> 01:07:04.786]  Little piece of you.
[01:07:05.327 --> 01:07:08.969]  A little piece of me.
[01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:13.752]  Swells like a miracle.
[01:07:13.872 --> 01:07:17.294]  For this is not America.
[01:07:19.816 --> 01:07:22.358]  Blossom fails to bloom the season.
[01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:32.398]  8 minutes 40 seconds into this second hour and I've heard a lot about this man and read a lot about him and really honored to have him.
[01:07:32.458 --> 01:07:33.259]  It's David Vanoss.
[01:07:33.279 --> 01:07:34.723]  He's running for Texas Attorney General.
[01:07:35.547 --> 01:07:42.730]  And he has filed affidavits concerning how he's going to criminally go after those in the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[01:07:43.150 --> 01:07:49.232]  And on its face, my friends, you have foreign companies coming in, openly paying off the government.
[01:07:49.632 --> 01:07:54.894]  You have the legislature saying, we want to see your agreements with Centro, the Spanish company.
[01:07:54.934 --> 01:07:56.655]  And they just say, no, you're not allowed to see them.
[01:07:57.195 --> 01:07:58.735]  Court's rule, they've got to release it.
[01:07:58.775 --> 01:08:00.036]  They say, no, it's gangster.
[01:08:00.818 --> 01:08:08.099]  And this is seizing the existing roads, placing toll roads on it, and when you hear Trans-Texas, it's just like the National ID Card, it'll be at the state level.
[01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:10.460]  Everything's standardized, you still have that state flavor.
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:18.922]  When you hear Trans-Texas Corridor, that's the NAFTA highway, and the transponders, the taxation grid, use the funding mechanism for the North American Union.
[01:08:19.282 --> 01:08:22.162]  So we're honored to have in the studio, David Van Aus.
[01:08:22.482 --> 01:08:23.823]  Sir, thank you so much for being here.
[01:08:24.283 --> 01:08:25.203]  The honor is mine.
[01:08:25.263 --> 01:08:25.963]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:08:27.481 --> 01:08:29.282]  I want to tell folks a little bit about yourself.
[01:08:29.302 --> 01:08:31.785]  You've got a lot of fans here in Central Texas.
[01:08:32.065 --> 01:08:37.511]  In the last few months, I've been becoming aware of your work, who you are, what you've done, why you're being so bold.
[01:08:39.072 --> 01:08:41.615]  Just during the break, you were calling the Bush regime a crime syndicate.
[01:08:41.875 --> 01:08:42.416]  That's what it is.
[01:08:42.456 --> 01:08:43.317]  Tell us about yourself.
[01:08:44.338 --> 01:08:48.922]  In just a nutshell and then give us a broad brush view of what your main plan is.
[01:08:49.223 --> 01:08:54.969]  You are the candidate for the Democrats running against the Republican Attorney General.
[01:08:55.269 --> 01:08:56.651]  You have a good chance of winning.
[01:08:56.771 --> 01:08:57.852]  Folks need to vote for you.
[01:08:58.638 --> 01:09:00.520]  Well, thank you very much, Alex.
[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:04.823]  I grew up in the little town of Kilgore in rural East Texas.
[01:09:05.984 --> 01:09:10.268]  Kilgore, Texas, used to be known as the oil capital of America.
[01:09:10.788 --> 01:09:20.096]  And my dad, in his working years, he's in his mid-80s and retired now, my dad worked in the oil fields and my mother was a junior high school teacher.
[01:09:21.548 --> 01:09:31.001]  The reason I'm so bold, Alex, is because boldness and speaking your mind in the political world should not be an exception.
[01:09:31.061 --> 01:09:32.062]  It should be the rule.
[01:09:32.363 --> 01:09:34.405]  It ought to be the normal way things are done.
[01:09:34.886 --> 01:09:36.048]  But we've been living under
[01:09:38.081 --> 01:10:00.316]  At least the past two generations worth of a political culture that has squeezed out plain talk and audacity and risk-taking and replaced it with a world of caution and gentility and really phony gentility and caution and packaging.
[01:10:00.336 --> 01:10:01.157]  We've been gilded.
[01:10:01.477 --> 01:10:05.499]  We've been neutered is what's happened.
[01:10:05.519 --> 01:10:06.640]  Tell us a little bit about yourself.
[01:10:08.479 --> 01:10:11.501]  I graduated from University of Texas Law School in 1976.
[01:10:12.582 --> 01:10:28.113]  I went to law school with the dream that I might be able to obtain tools to enable me to spend a life pursuing justice.
[01:10:29.294 --> 01:10:38.527]  And my first job out of law school, I went to work for a for a labor union that had a field office in Austin, Texas.
[01:10:39.389 --> 01:10:44.276]  And I've spent the last 30 years concentrating in
[01:10:46.442 --> 01:10:57.531]  Working in the field of labor law on the union side and the worker side and constitutional law and civil rights type projects.
[01:10:57.571 --> 01:11:00.534]  What made you decide to run for Texas Attorney General?
[01:11:00.554 --> 01:11:02.315]  And let's jump into what you've done.
[01:11:02.355 --> 01:11:04.477]  I mean, you want these people to go to prison.
[01:11:04.898 --> 01:11:06.899]  This guy's going to go after them.
[01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:11.143]  I decided to run for Texas Attorney General because I had to.
[01:11:12.318 --> 01:11:21.956]  I think that in a democracy, citizens are supposed to take the personal responsibility to do their part to make self-government function.
[01:11:23.957 --> 01:11:40.048]  I felt that I just was compelled, I just had to get involved at the level of trying to knock off one of the members of the silk stocking social clique that runs Texas government as if it was a private club.
[01:11:40.689 --> 01:11:44.311]  And the Attorney General in Texas is an extraordinary position.
[01:11:44.331 --> 01:11:47.994]  The Attorney General in Texas under the Texas Constitution
[01:11:50.387 --> 01:11:58.348]  Is the one officer of our state government who uniquely is charged with responsibility and given the tools of office
[01:11:58.999 --> 01:12:00.399]  To be the people's champion.
[01:12:00.859 --> 01:12:12.682]  To represent and defend and fight for the people, for the rights and liberties of the people, as individuals, as citizens, as consumers, as taxpayers, as private property owners.
[01:12:12.742 --> 01:12:24.265]  And what we've got now in Austin, we've got an Attorney General who is a corporate mouthpiece and who is a partisan hack for the Bushite gangsters that hijacked the Republican Party.
[01:12:25.071 --> 01:12:26.911]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:12:26.931 --> 01:12:29.272]  Number one, you have a good chance of winning.
[01:12:29.292 --> 01:12:30.572]  Let's talk about that briefly.
[01:12:30.592 --> 01:12:38.434]  This is a national fight for people listening in New York, listening in Missouri, listening in Florida, listening in California, listening in Idaho, Montana, it doesn't matter.
[01:12:38.735 --> 01:12:44.376]  In Canada, Texas is the main battleground on so many issues and they admit they're going to use the trans-Texas corridor
[01:12:45.271 --> 01:12:48.492]  Because Bush has had trouble with the North American Union at the federal level.
[01:12:48.792 --> 01:12:54.774]  So what they're doing is they're going in and using the states to set up units of it to then fund the system.
[01:12:54.814 --> 01:12:56.075]  So this is a key fight.
[01:12:56.115 --> 01:12:56.895]  This is the gates.
[01:12:56.975 --> 01:13:01.317]  We're here at the gates fighting the North American Union's blood supply.
[01:13:01.337 --> 01:13:04.738]  It's literal mechanism to fund itself.
[01:13:04.998 --> 01:13:07.259]  It's so important to kill this trans-Texas corridor.
[01:13:07.279 --> 01:13:08.119]  It's in a lot of trouble.
[01:13:08.479 --> 01:13:12.822]  Tell us about what you're doing concerning the toll roads and what Perry and others have done.
[01:13:12.882 --> 01:13:16.944]  I have the affidavit for public record here right in front of me.
[01:13:17.424 --> 01:13:19.566]  Break that down for us and what you've done.
[01:13:23.108 --> 01:13:33.514]  In the one paragraph of the Texas Constitution that defines the duties and responsibilities of the Attorney General of Texas, there is a remarkable passage
[01:13:34.275 --> 01:13:38.356]  That applies directly to the Trans-Texas Corridor and to any toll roads.
[01:13:39.656 --> 01:13:58.560]  Article 4, Section 22 of the Texas Constitution mandates that the Attorney General shall do everything necessary and proper in the courts to prevent and restrain any private corporation from demanding or collecting any species of toll that's not authorized by law.
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:02.641]  If it's unconstitutional, it's not authorized by law under our checks and balances.
[01:14:03.639 --> 01:14:14.593]  I say that the Trans-Texas Corridor is unconstitutional under the Texas Constitution because our state constitution prohibits the appropriation of public money for private gain.
[01:14:15.533 --> 01:14:37.117]  And when you take the magnitude of the forcible eminent domain that is going to take people's homes, lands, and properties away from them by the exercise of government power, we're talking about hundreds and hundreds of thousands of acres of land that is privately owned today that the property owners don't want to give up.
[01:14:37.217 --> 01:14:40.218]  By the way, that's conservative, what you just said.
[01:14:41.112 --> 01:14:43.014]  I mean, that's a conservative amount of land.
[01:14:44.155 --> 01:14:49.740]  From the numbers I've seen officially, it's much higher what they're going to grab.
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:53.022]  Well, it's probably at least a million acres or more.
[01:15:01.209 --> 01:15:20.286]  Projected exercise a forcible eminent domain and you couple that with the magnitude of the billions of dollars that these greedy foreign companies from Spain are projected to make in operating the toll road and collecting the toll fees
[01:15:20.806 --> 01:15:31.330]  When you put those two things together, in my considered opinion, that violates the Texas Constitutional Prohibition on the appropriation of public money for private gain.
[01:15:31.450 --> 01:15:35.791]  Well, I mean, to look at the whole system, I call it racketeering, and I don't use that term lightly.
[01:15:36.131 --> 01:15:37.211]  This is organized crime.
[01:15:37.552 --> 01:15:43.273]  They come in, they buy off your politicians, they cut sweetheart deals where they're guaranteed incredible profits.
[01:15:43.333 --> 01:15:44.734]  It clearly states in the agreement
[01:15:45.274 --> 01:15:55.938]  And this has been in the newspapers here, folks, that if other public roads are cutting back on their guaranteed profit, that they can then shut other roads to make you use the toll roads.
[01:15:56.358 --> 01:15:59.719]  Then there's the fact that they want to put a transponder in all the inspection stickers.
[01:15:59.739 --> 01:16:05.261]  We barely shot that down to basically tax us on all the major roads, 8,000 miles of them.
[01:16:05.481 --> 01:16:07.322]  The whole country only has 7,000 miles.
[01:16:08.282 --> 01:16:10.783]  This is the magnitude of what we're talking about.
[01:16:11.934 --> 01:16:18.822]  It doesn't matter whether it's California, Oregon, Florida, New York, they're all coming in with the same system and they're seizing existing roads.
[01:16:18.882 --> 01:16:30.336]  Now the way they got around that is they claim they'll add another lane or do some work on the shoulder or if this company ever does upkeep on an existing road that makes it a new road and then now they get to take control of it.
[01:16:30.356 --> 01:16:30.856]  I mean this is
[01:16:31.537 --> 01:16:42.927]  This is just like when the Queen of England or the King of Spain says 500 years ago all I give is Ireland or this country or I claim the Western Hemisphere for Portugal.
[01:16:43.227 --> 01:16:47.030]  This is going back to feudalism where they just say we're taking your roads.
[01:16:47.791 --> 01:16:48.352]  Absolutely.
[01:16:48.732 --> 01:16:52.035]  And Alex, it makes my blood turn cold.
[01:16:52.651 --> 01:17:00.839]  To think about the fact that King Juan Carlos of Spain is a part owner of one of the companies that's going to be operating that toll road.
[01:17:00.879 --> 01:17:02.360]  Now you can think about it this way.
[01:17:02.801 --> 01:17:03.742]  The very land
[01:17:04.483 --> 01:17:09.185]  The very less considered, the private property, the personal property of the King of Spain.
[01:17:09.225 --> 01:17:09.986]  No, exactly.
[01:17:10.006 --> 01:17:15.128]  In fact, my family in 1829 got a whole bunch of land in East Texas, you know where Buffalo is?
[01:17:15.268 --> 01:17:15.969]  Yes, I do.
[01:17:16.349 --> 01:17:17.149]  From the King of Spain.
[01:17:17.289 --> 01:17:19.670]  We have the grant from the King of Spain.
[01:17:19.811 --> 01:17:26.694]  Well, people in this part of the world rose up a couple of centuries ago, two or three centuries ago, and threw off
[01:17:27.821 --> 01:17:30.243]  Imperial European colonial domination.
[01:17:30.644 --> 01:17:44.134]  This Trans-Texas Corridor is really like inviting European colonial domination back into our land and our state voluntarily.
[01:17:44.234 --> 01:17:53.201]  And you are so right about the NAFTA superhighway that the Trans-Texas Corridor in Texas is projected to
[01:17:54.123 --> 01:17:56.249]  Uh, be basically the first leg of it.
[01:17:56.289 --> 01:17:57.172]  Do you know, Alex?
[01:17:57.312 --> 01:17:57.794]  Did you know?
[01:17:57.834 --> 01:17:58.877]  And you probably know this.
[01:17:59.548 --> 01:18:08.612]  That it is projected that on that North American superhighway, the customs point of entry into the United States of America will be in Kansas City.
[01:18:09.573 --> 01:18:10.393]  Not in Mexico.
[01:18:10.593 --> 01:18:11.614]  They have a website up.
[01:18:11.654 --> 01:18:12.394]  It's going to be running it.
[01:18:12.434 --> 01:18:13.795]  The Mexican government will search it.
[01:18:14.035 --> 01:18:17.196]  And we're going to have people way down in southern Mexico.
[01:18:17.236 --> 01:18:18.237]  That's globalism.
[01:18:18.437 --> 01:18:19.657]  The Canadians get the U.S.
[01:18:19.677 --> 01:18:20.718]  The Mexicans get the U.S.
[01:18:20.738 --> 01:18:21.118]  The U.S.
[01:18:21.138 --> 01:18:21.798]  gets Mexico.
[01:18:21.818 --> 01:18:22.699]  They're doing it.
[01:18:22.719 --> 01:18:24.380]  We're going to talk more about it.
[01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:25.700]  I'm going to talk about your affidavit.
[01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:26.881]  You've got a way to stop this.
[01:18:27.521 --> 01:18:28.622]  And this is really exciting.
[01:18:28.642 --> 01:18:32.426]  We'll be back with our guest after this quick break.
[01:18:32.466 --> 01:18:33.828]  We'll open the phones up later.
[01:18:34.972 --> 01:18:38.635]  When you're looking to build a new facility, there's a lot riding on your shoulders.
[01:18:38.955 --> 01:18:40.856]  You have to get a structure that meets your needs.
[01:18:41.136 --> 01:18:42.697]  You need one that's built to last.
[01:18:42.997 --> 01:18:47.240]  You need to get it built quickly, and most importantly, you need it to stay within budget.
[01:18:47.661 --> 01:18:51.323]  What you need is a pre-engineered steel building from Anthem Steel.
[01:18:51.683 --> 01:18:57.507]  You won't believe how much you'll save, in both time and money, with a brand new built-to-last steel building.
[01:18:57.807 --> 01:19:02.210]  For free information on how you can get the building you need with less time and money, call 1-800-339-1700.
[01:19:05.192 --> 01:19:06.812]  You can even customize your building.
[01:19:07.173 --> 01:19:08.193]  You select the size.
[01:19:08.433 --> 01:19:09.493]  You select the style.
[01:19:09.733 --> 01:19:12.614]  You can even choose to add the look of brick, stucco, or stone.
[01:19:12.974 --> 01:19:15.454]  Building a new facility is a big responsibility.
[01:19:15.795 --> 01:19:18.015]  Make it easier by calling Anthem Steel.
[01:19:18.415 --> 01:19:21.496]  Achieve your goals faster and with less strain on your budget.
[01:19:21.816 --> 01:19:23.976]  For free information, call Anthem Steel at 1-800-339-1700.
[01:19:24.017 --> 01:19:24.877]  Call Anthem Steel today.
[01:19:24.897 --> 01:19:24.977]  1-800-339-1700.
[01:19:24.997 --> 01:19:25.277]  That's 1-800-339-1700.
[01:19:34.779 --> 01:19:35.759]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:40.621]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:19:40.802 --> 01:19:48.605]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:19:48.865 --> 01:19:54.227]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:19:54.427 --> 01:20:01.410]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:20:01.710 --> 01:20:07.056]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:20:07.316 --> 01:20:12.042]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:20:12.382 --> 01:20:20.010]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:20:20.331 --> 01:20:23.014]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt,
[01:20:23.454 --> 01:20:26.557]  Gold, on its own, has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:20:26.877 --> 01:20:30.400]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:31.300]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:31.420 --> 01:20:38.046]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:20:38.086 --> 01:20:38.606]  are located?
[01:20:38.806 --> 01:20:42.209]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[01:20:42.429 --> 01:20:47.133]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[01:20:47.413 --> 01:20:52.417]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[01:20:52.677 --> 01:20:58.701]  Brewing environmental catastrophes, the safest cities, the best places for solar and wind energy, and much, much more.
[01:20:58.981 --> 01:21:13.370]  Complete with three gigabytes of detailed information on each of 3,000 plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis to help you zero in on the best places to live.
[01:21:13.630 --> 01:21:18.274]  The ideal location for cabins and vacation homes, as well as safe and unsafe areas.
[01:21:18.574 --> 01:21:24.058]  Get Prudent Places USA for only $49 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:21:24.098 --> 01:21:26.520]  That's 888-803-4438 to order on the web or at Berkeywater.com.
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:35.481]  Hello, this is Amy Bjorklund.
[01:21:35.781 --> 01:21:43.145]  Thanks to a quantum leap in garlic research, the health benefits of 20 fresh garlic cloves are now available in one tiny capsule.
[01:21:43.326 --> 01:21:51.110]  With stabilized allicins, the proven power of garlic has been transformed into what is perhaps the most important medicinal product ever developed.
[01:21:51.310 --> 01:21:52.391]  And there's no odor.
[01:21:52.631 --> 01:22:02.660]  Stabilized Allicin gives you and your family a safe, natural weapon that kills harmful bacteria, viruses, and funguses, all without harming the friendly bacteria in the digestive tract.
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:10.967]  This means strong immunity, fewer and shorter colds, and the best possible protection from deadly diseases, none of which prescription drugs can offer.
[01:22:11.227 --> 01:22:16.792]  What's more, this product can deter mosquitoes from biting you and safely keep fleas and ticks off your pets.
[01:22:17.219 --> 01:22:17.919]  Coming up, November 7th,
[01:22:45.678 --> 01:22:47.499]  Key election nationwide.
[01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:49.680]  Notice the big oil.
[01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:53.703]  I'm coming after you, David Vanoss, the People's Lawyer for Attorney General.
[01:22:56.244 --> 01:22:57.725]  Great poster, great slogan.
[01:22:57.805 --> 01:22:58.245]  I love it.
[01:22:58.946 --> 01:23:01.607]  We were having an amazing discussion, David, during the break.
[01:23:01.667 --> 01:23:07.271]  Please repeat everything you said about Texas being the root and how angry the rural folks are.
[01:23:07.291 --> 01:23:08.011]  You know, I've talked.
[01:23:09.389 --> 01:23:11.670]  Not just the candidates in Texas, but candidates in other states.
[01:23:11.690 --> 01:23:12.870]  They're all upset about this.
[01:23:13.171 --> 01:23:16.092]  And they are informed, and they are actually going to SPP.gov.
[01:23:16.492 --> 01:23:18.292]  They're actually going to the government documents.
[01:23:18.873 --> 01:23:27.696]  And I've had other candidates in here who say that people, mainstream folks, I mean, at county meetings with judges and people, are talking about getting violent.
[01:23:27.916 --> 01:23:31.798]  There's open public discussion of revolution in Texas.
[01:23:31.998 --> 01:23:32.758]  David, tell us about it.
[01:23:36.604 --> 01:23:43.650]  The most important elections in the entire country, this November 7th, are the state elections in Texas.
[01:23:44.191 --> 01:23:45.072]  And I mean that.
[01:23:45.532 --> 01:23:56.962]  Because Texas, you see, Texas is where the evil that is afflicting the country, and through the country afflicting the world, Texas is where this current evil sprouted from.
[01:23:57.343 --> 01:24:02.888]  And if you want to dig up something by its roots, and eradicate it, you've got to go to where the roots are.
[01:24:03.348 --> 01:24:11.663]  There is only one place that this Bushite evil can be dug up by the roots and eradicated, and that is in Texas.
[01:24:12.103 --> 01:24:13.886]  It's got to be done right here.
[01:24:14.488 --> 01:24:15.629]  And Texas, you see,
[01:24:16.938 --> 01:24:26.043]  Uh, when you do it in Texas, then that's the only thing that really starts a domino chain, uh, spreading to other states, and spreading to other states.
[01:24:26.183 --> 01:24:29.705]  I just really... It's only been said for 50 years that as Texas goes, so goes the country.
[01:24:29.805 --> 01:24:35.649]  Well, and that's absolutely true, and a lot of people around, a lot of other people around the country
[01:24:36.529 --> 01:24:37.009]  Yes, I do.
[01:24:53.951 --> 01:24:55.472]  Why Texas is so important.
[01:24:55.933 --> 01:24:57.034]  But it's really the key.
[01:24:57.274 --> 01:25:08.343]  For one thing, the Trans-Texas Corridor is being planned on to be the first leg of this NAFTA, North American Superhighway.
[01:25:08.563 --> 01:25:12.266]  It's like a cancer that's going to grow south out of Texas and north out of Texas.
[01:25:12.587 --> 01:25:13.127]  That's right.
[01:25:13.287 --> 01:25:19.913]  And I hope your listeners know, or if they don't know yet, I hope they go to the internet and look it up, because it's public knowledge.
[01:25:20.413 --> 01:25:35.860]  That on this North American superhighway the customs point of entry into the United States of America is going to be in Kansas City and that means goods and products rushing across the top of the country from both directions and in Texas
[01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:37.201]  I don't know.
[01:25:55.294 --> 01:25:59.777]  And let's be clear, they admit that they're going to wall off the corridors.
[01:25:59.817 --> 01:26:09.304]  They go around all the towns and cities and you see similar systems like this on toll roads up in Oklahoma into Kansas where you'll drive 50 miles before you can even exit.
[01:26:09.324 --> 01:26:11.686]  You see nothing but ghost towns on either side.
[01:26:11.806 --> 01:26:13.587]  Why do they want to kill all these little towns?
[01:26:14.688 --> 01:26:24.015]  Well, they want to kill all these little towns because directly contrary to the misguided journalistic and political
[01:26:25.362 --> 01:26:42.090]  Pundit classes who are so out of touch with the real world, they know that the rural areas are where there is the most, the greatest potential for sparks to light and for real fighting spirits to arise.
[01:26:42.510 --> 01:26:44.391]  Now, I have been to TexDoc
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:27:05.985]  Public meetings where hundreds of people have shown up to express in public comments to the bureaucrats their outrage over the Trans-Texas Corridor and many people have stood up at those public meetings and on the public record right out there in the open have said things
[01:27:06.625 --> 01:27:15.477]  Along the lines of, I'm going to exercise my rights under the Second Amendment and I'm going to fight you over this thing if you start taking my farm away from me.
[01:27:16.508 --> 01:27:18.510]  Well, people will get violent over family land.
[01:27:18.810 --> 01:27:19.471]  It's guaranteed.
[01:27:19.531 --> 01:27:20.732]  You betcha they will, Alex.
[01:27:20.812 --> 01:27:25.896]  I'd like to, if you don't mind, I'd like to relate just a little personal anecdote.
[01:27:25.976 --> 01:27:31.921]  My wife, Rachel, and I were attending a TexDoc public hearing in Yorktown, Texas.
[01:27:32.382 --> 01:27:36.986]  Yorktown's kind of between Cuero and Victoria on the coastal plain.
[01:27:38.848 --> 01:27:54.307]  And the lady gets up to the podium and she's addressing the TxDOT bureaucrats and she says to them, the land that my husband and I are farming has been in my family for five straight generations.
[01:27:54.907 --> 01:28:01.311]  And then she says, my 5th generation back ancestor came here in the 1820's with Stephen F. Austin.
[01:28:01.731 --> 01:28:03.633]  And this land is sacred ground to me.
[01:28:04.093 --> 01:28:06.294]  It should be sacred ground to my state.
[01:28:06.715 --> 01:28:17.481]  And now you're talking about, you're going to take my land from me so you can build a big highway and I'm not even going to be able to drive on that highway unless I pay a toll.
[01:28:17.501 --> 01:28:18.422]  Stay there, we've got a break.
[01:28:18.442 --> 01:28:19.723]  Stay there, finish the story when we get back.
[01:28:22.794 --> 01:28:25.796]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:26.697 --> 01:28:29.499]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:33.102 --> 01:28:35.584]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:28:35.704 --> 01:28:38.066]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[01:28:38.126 --> 01:28:45.212]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote unquote.
[01:28:45.792 --> 01:28:47.994]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:28:48.732 --> 01:28:52.275]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:28:52.815 --> 01:28:56.958]  The truth is, is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:28:57.538 --> 01:29:00.520]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:29:01.481 --> 01:29:04.403]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:29:05.143 --> 01:29:07.585]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.

[01:29:36.588 --> 01:29:39.991]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[01:31:05.981 --> 01:31:06.301]  I don't know.
[01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:38.821]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:31:39.501 --> 01:31:41.802]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:12.291 --> 01:32:23.580]  David Van Oss is our guest here in studio and we're going to be taking your calls later in the shower, hopefully even a little bit into the next hour so we have plenty of time to take your calls.
[01:32:25.061 --> 01:32:33.969]  For our radio listeners out there in Radioland, coming up next, well it'll be not next week but the next Tuesday after that,
[01:32:37.959 --> 01:32:43.567]  At the Waterloo Records there on 6th Street and Lamar.
[01:32:43.587 --> 01:32:46.411]  I'm going to be there from 5 to 6.30.
[01:32:46.832 --> 01:32:47.893]  I'm going to give a speech.
[01:32:47.913 --> 01:32:49.175]  They've got a little PA system.
[01:32:49.836 --> 01:32:53.301]  And then I'm going to sign my new film, my new documentary, Terror Storm.
[01:32:54.452 --> 01:32:55.533]  So I hope to see you.
[01:32:55.553 --> 01:32:56.373]  I hope to shake your hand.
[01:32:56.393 --> 01:32:57.794]  I hope for you to come out.
[01:32:58.515 --> 01:33:06.841]  October 31st is the national launch for November 1st in stores all over the country of my new film, Terror Storm.
[01:33:07.301 --> 01:33:09.382]  It's going to be in end caps at Barnes & Noble's.
[01:33:09.863 --> 01:33:11.544]  It's going to be in Virgin Records stores.
[01:33:12.224 --> 01:33:15.927]  It's going to be in thousands and thousands of stores around the country.
[01:33:17.111 --> 01:33:28.215]  We are making the greatest effort we can to fight the globalists, to expose government-sponsored terror, to expose how 9-11 was hatched from the bowels of the military-industrial complex.
[01:33:29.535 --> 01:33:33.276]  TerrorStorm does that definitively, proves it conclusively.
[01:33:33.696 --> 01:33:38.538]  Now, of course, the DVD's already been available for a few months at InfoWars.com.
[01:33:38.578 --> 01:33:41.299]  It goes into stores October 31st.
[01:33:42.039 --> 01:33:44.540]  But please go to InfoWars.com and secure

[01:33:55.389 --> 01:34:04.638]  Two hours of that symposium was carried by C-SPAN nationally, but you'll get a chance to see the highlights of the information that you were unable to witness.
[01:34:04.698 --> 01:34:05.639]  It is an excellent film.
[01:34:05.679 --> 01:34:09.262]  Again, Terror Storm, available from InfoWars.com.

[01:34:11.286 --> 01:34:11.967]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:34:12.007 --> 01:34:14.650]  We're here with David Vanoss fighting the Trans-Texas Corridor
[01:34:25.924 --> 01:34:28.988]  And we are so excited to have him with us.
[01:34:29.028 --> 01:34:31.932]  He is running, of course, as a Democrat.
[01:34:32.433 --> 01:34:40.725]  Inside the two-party system, he has got a really good chance in the polls and on the news, he's been reporting, of beating the Republican incumbent.
[01:34:41.886 --> 01:34:47.550]  The problem is Dick Cheney and others have said they don't care, they're not worried nationwide.
[01:34:48.130 --> 01:34:57.016]  Karl Rove has said, right here in Texas of course, that they're going to win despite all the polls showing they're going to lose at the state level and the federal level because they are stealing elections where they can.
[01:34:57.316 --> 01:35:01.779]  But they don't have their little special voting machines in place in every county in Texas.
[01:35:02.419 --> 01:35:14.984]  And so if there is a landslide, people like David Van Osh and others, Libertarian candidates, Republican candidates, Democratic candidates, anti-New World Order candidates, have a really good chance of winning.
[01:35:15.885 --> 01:35:23.748]  So please, folks, get involved and get out and vote and have an effect because we have to fight this at many different levels.
[01:35:24.872 --> 01:35:48.104]  David, I want to go to some calls later, but right now, I want you to relay some more of the stories you told about the rural areas, how upset people are, where you think this is going, and then how this ties in to this whole globalization, this whole New World Order, because it is elite groups that I've traveled and covered and documented, like the Bilderberg Group, who are saying they want to get rid of our sovereignty and replace it under this new system.
[01:35:48.124 --> 01:35:50.725]  I'm sure you've heard about the North American Union and SPP and how...
[01:35:52.327 --> 01:35:57.692]  Give us your take on more of what you've gotten traveling to every county in the state today.
[01:35:57.932 --> 01:36:01.796]  I guess the last one you were doing, we're going to send a camera crew down to the Travis County Courthouse.
[01:36:01.816 --> 01:36:03.357]  You're going to file your affidavit.
[01:36:03.397 --> 01:36:09.663]  So tell us about the anger level you're seeing, which I've been told is unprecedented, and that's what I'm getting here as well.
[01:36:09.763 --> 01:36:15.369]  And then get into the whole New World Order, North American Union aspect of this, and then your affidavit.
[01:36:21.124 --> 01:36:42.249]  When the founders of the United States of America proclaimed their Declaration of Independence to the world on July 4, 1776, which, by the way, they knew that logically their prospects for defeating the mightiest empire in the world at that time were about 0%, and they knew that their
[01:36:43.178 --> 01:37:05.972]  Odds of success and they knew that if they didn't succeed they would all be hung as traitors to the British crown and did it anyway because they were on fire with a vision for a new society in the world and one of the things they were on fire about was that in this new society in this new way of human beings organizing themselves socially and politically
[01:37:06.664 --> 01:37:17.234]  There was not supposed to be any royalty, there was not supposed to be any aristocracy, and the Constitution they eventually wrote even says there shall be no titles of royalty.
[01:37:17.715 --> 01:37:24.441]  And what has happened in the world today, Alex, is that... Officials, authorities, excellencies, our bosses...
[01:37:25.462 --> 01:37:46.893]  What has happened today is that at the top of the ladders of the big business world, of the political world, the governmental world, and the journalistic world all together, the big punditry class, we have, our society has, and the world, has developed an aristocracy.
[01:37:47.433 --> 01:37:54.196]  And what I am finding going all over Texas is that people know that and people don't like it.
[01:37:54.656 --> 01:37:55.617]  Nobody likes it.
[01:37:56.297 --> 01:38:05.921]  Everybody's tired of the elite upper class, the elite aristocracies that are running the show in all sectors, all sectors of our society and every endeavor.
[01:38:05.981 --> 01:38:11.564]  And you see, what I'm finding is that this goes way beyond the
[01:38:12.876 --> 01:38:19.077]  Way beyond the official party lines of Democrat, Republican, Libertarian, Green, whatever.
[01:38:19.797 --> 01:38:28.139]  There is more in common right now between grassroots Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, Greens.
[01:38:29.479 --> 01:38:40.261]  There is more in common right now between the grassroots of all of the people in all the political affiliations than there is between the grassroots and the elite in any party.
[01:38:41.985 --> 01:38:48.228]  And that is a big indicator of the populist revolt that is really brewing here.
[01:38:48.428 --> 01:38:51.830]  It's brewing in the country, and it's brewing big time in Texas.
[01:38:52.930 --> 01:39:08.839]  And you see, it is a huge reaction and backlash to what people instinctively can perceive, because people are not dumb, they're smart.
[01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:31.480]  People can instinctively perceive how there is this sort of giant thing that's all combined at the top and that's like elite superclasses at the top of the ladder socially, politically, and economically.
[01:39:32.890 --> 01:39:37.673]  I'll just give you a little funny, interesting little anecdote and you ask me what's going on.
[01:39:38.253 --> 01:39:44.497]  I was sitting in the county courthouse of Rayall County.
[01:39:45.878 --> 01:39:47.458]  The county seat is Lakey, Texas.
[01:39:47.478 --> 01:40:02.127]  And I was sitting in the county judge's office and I was visiting with the very rural, very country, wonderful people with the county judge and one of the county commissioners there of Rayall County.
[01:40:02.708 --> 01:40:18.818]  And as I was talking about how we have to, we have the right, we the people have the right and the power to finally get up on our feet and take a stand and fight back against the growth of corporate monopoly power.
[01:40:19.438 --> 01:40:27.683]  This elderly county commissioner says to me, he says, you know, we've been watching monopolies grow up for about the last 30 years.
[01:40:28.244 --> 01:40:32.206]  And there's a lot of people who used to have small businesses on our main street.
[01:40:32.859 --> 01:40:36.141]  That aren't in business anymore because they got squeezed out by monopolies.
[01:40:36.621 --> 01:40:37.922]  He says, everybody knows it.
[01:40:38.722 --> 01:40:44.085]  And he says, I think you're telling me that we do have the right to do something about it.
[01:40:44.565 --> 01:40:46.346]  And you're pledging to do something about it.
[01:40:46.366 --> 01:40:50.548]  And I said to him, yes, sir, Mr. Commissioner, that's exactly what I'm saying.
[01:40:51.008 --> 01:40:52.489]  And he says more power to you.
[01:40:52.869 --> 01:40:58.432]  And then the county judge also adds his voice to the same chorus.
[01:41:00.306 --> 01:41:23.751]  The Trans-Texas Corridor is kind of like a microcosm, a coming together, a nexus, where all of this growth of a reign of greed and of arrogance and of super elite aristocracies that we're living under
[01:41:24.523 --> 01:41:45.789]  All comes together and that's why I am and I mean it I am filing in every county courthouse with every county clerk in the state of Texas a sworn affidavit affidavits a legal term and term of the legal and business worlds that means a written oath a written oath of my intentions that I'm
[01:41:46.508 --> 01:41:53.911]  Filing with all the county clerks because I want it to be a public record in every county in Texas of my intentions.
[01:41:55.012 --> 01:42:12.180]  And the first part of my sworn affidavit says, I'm looking at it and quoting from it, therefore if elected to serve as Attorney General of Texas, I solemnly promise that I will use every legal means available to me by that office
[01:42:12.896 --> 01:42:20.740]  To bring to a halt and or invalidate the unconstitutional and illegal project known as the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[01:42:20.780 --> 01:42:21.420]  And I mean it.
[01:42:21.941 --> 01:42:23.721]  I'm going to fight it till hell freezes over.
[01:42:24.082 --> 01:42:26.143]  And then I'm going to fight it on the ice if I have to.
[01:42:26.563 --> 01:42:29.945]  Because we have got to stop this thing.
[01:42:30.345 --> 01:42:31.505]  We have got to beat it.
[01:42:32.266 --> 01:42:37.108]  You've also said that you'll put injunctions against them and that you're going to block all of this chicanery.
[01:42:37.368 --> 01:42:42.471]  The actual legal tool that I will possess as Attorney General
[01:42:43.255 --> 01:43:09.714]  is to sue is to bring suit in the courts against against Sintra Zachary to try to obtain permanent injunctions against them to order them to cease and desist permanently from building this thing and the beauty about a civil injunction is that it's enforceable through contempt of court so if a party violates
[01:43:11.107 --> 01:43:12.408]  You can arrest it's officers.
[01:43:12.748 --> 01:43:24.293]  Yes, the court can incarcerate people for contempt of court for violating injunction decrees.
[01:43:24.333 --> 01:43:26.253]  And I'm going to go after them as hard as I can.
[01:43:26.994 --> 01:43:27.554]  Absolutely.
[01:43:28.574 --> 01:43:37.658]  And what I want people to understand, listen up good folks of New York and California and Minnesota who are listening here.
[01:43:38.976 --> 01:43:50.261]  The country people in Texas and the good, honest, working-class people in Texas and middle-class people in Texas know what is going on.
[01:43:50.601 --> 01:43:51.341]  Yeah, that's the good news.
[01:43:51.361 --> 01:43:52.242]  The cat's out of the bag.
[01:43:52.282 --> 01:43:54.823]  And a few other issues I want to bring up.
[01:43:55.343 --> 01:43:58.644]  You talked about arrogance, and this is what scares me.
[01:43:58.845 --> 01:44:06.768]  And we see this hyper-arrogance emerge with the Help America Vote Act and the federally installed
[01:44:07.788 --> 01:44:12.192]  Fraudulently designed electronic voting machines.
[01:44:12.712 --> 01:44:24.823]  In the past, if 70% of people were against something, or 95% were against something, or 90%, the politicians would get in line and do what was constitutional and do what the people were demanding.
[01:44:25.590 --> 01:44:30.414]  Now, it doesn't matter if 77% are against the war, they go ahead with it.
[01:44:30.894 --> 01:44:40.722]  97% and 98% and 99%, depending on the Texas poll, say we don't want the Trans-Texas Corridor, we don't want the Nav-to-Highway, and that's with the public having limited knowledge.
[01:44:40.962 --> 01:44:42.123]  They know a lot about it, but not
[01:44:42.683 --> 01:44:45.706]  Even to try to tell you all the horrible facets, it's hard to do.
[01:44:45.906 --> 01:44:50.269]  I mean, it's that bad, but 97% in the Houston Chronicle poll and other polls.
[01:44:50.730 --> 01:44:58.296]  And then now, for the first time in, I've studied, you know, politics and state politics and national politics going back since the founding of this country and this state.
[01:44:59.948 --> 01:45:15.258]  And back when this state was a country, they've never behaved like this before, unless you're talking maybe about Sherman and the Civil War and Reconstruction, but even that got repulsed right here in Texas when it got abusive a few years into it with a northern-installed governor.
[01:45:15.298 --> 01:45:27.206]  So I've never seen anything like this, and it's foreign companies involved, and they are just so arrogant in what they're doing, and Rick Perry is such a monster
[01:45:27.946 --> 01:45:33.530]  And Bush is such a monster, and the Democrats, during the break you talked about how the Democrats know the leadership's bad.
[01:45:33.851 --> 01:45:37.493]  I go to these anti-war rallies, somebody says, yay Hillary, and everybody goes, boo.
[01:45:37.874 --> 01:45:39.715]  I mean, finally, it isn't dumb liberals anymore.
[01:45:39.775 --> 01:45:45.439]  They know, their party's taking, I mean, so, I think the establishment, the elite, has overplayed their hand.
[01:45:45.719 --> 01:45:50.383]  Because their hubris is so out in the open now, it has shattered the left-right paradigm.
[01:45:50.703 --> 01:45:55.847]  The left and the right are really coming together now, in a true populism, a constitutionalism,
[01:45:56.307 --> 01:45:59.648]  Well, you see, and for this reason, I'm actually optimistic, Alex, about where we're going to end up.
[01:45:59.668 --> 01:46:01.508]  Because what has happened is that the elegant elite
[01:46:26.261 --> 01:46:40.126]  got so convinced that they were untouchable politically and that they could never be deposed, never knocked out of power, that their conceit and their cockiness got the better of them.
[01:46:40.586 --> 01:46:41.747]  And they went too far.
[01:46:42.127 --> 01:46:51.650]  They've now exposed themselves to the mainstream American, and in my state, the mainstream Texan, and people are getting it now.
[01:46:51.690 --> 01:46:52.711]  They're waking up to it.
[01:46:52.731 --> 01:46:53.511]  I'll tell you like
[01:46:54.552 --> 01:47:20.650]  A county judge in Cass County, over in Far East Texas, in the little town of Linden, about 10 miles from the Louisiana border, after I gave my courthouse speech there early in the summer, I'm walking back to my car to get on to the next stop, and the county judge is walking me, or he was one of the county judges, he drapes his arm over my shoulder and he says to me,
[01:47:21.408 --> 01:47:26.790]  You know, these country people around here aren't near as dumb as the rich folks in Washington think they are.
[01:47:27.311 --> 01:47:33.714]  They know what's happening, they don't like it, and they're just waiting until November for their voices to be heard.
[01:47:34.334 --> 01:47:47.420]  And Alex, I was in on September the 29th, which was the day after the cowardly United States Senate caved in on Bush's
[01:47:48.716 --> 01:47:54.462]  Uh, on Bush's demand to suspend the writ of habeas corpus and legalize torture in the name of the American people.
[01:47:54.502 --> 01:47:55.763]  Well, they butchered 9 of the 10 amendments.
[01:47:56.324 --> 01:47:57.505]  Absolutely, they butchered them.
[01:47:57.946 --> 01:48:05.093]  I was in Paducah, Texas, uh, the next morning, uh, going to speak to people at the Cottle County Courthouse.
[01:48:06.034 --> 01:48:10.499]  Uh, in the little town of Paducah in West Texas, it's wheat and cotton country.
[01:48:11.159 --> 01:48:21.589]  And the first thing that happened is that an elderly farmer who was there to meet me, knew I was going to be there, was there to meet me.
[01:48:22.461 --> 01:48:39.066]  First thing he wanted to talk about was what the United States Senate had done the afternoon before in suspending the writ of habeas corpus and shredding the Bill of Rights and giving George W. Bush another movement toward dictatorship.
[01:48:39.286 --> 01:48:40.027]  He is.
[01:48:40.307 --> 01:48:42.949]  He is perfecting dictatorship right now.
[01:48:42.989 --> 01:48:45.531]  He is moving into full dictator role.
[01:48:45.951 --> 01:48:47.492]  But he can claim he's dictator all day.
[01:48:47.553 --> 01:48:49.034]  He's nothing but a low-down criminal.
[01:48:49.314 --> 01:48:50.975]  He's not a dictator and we're going to defeat him.
[01:48:51.436 --> 01:48:52.016]  Absolutely.
[01:48:52.076 --> 01:48:53.837]  You see, the people are getting it.
[01:48:53.897 --> 01:48:55.619]  The people are waking up, Alex.
[01:48:56.840 --> 01:49:00.162]  I ran into this everywhere in Texas.
[01:49:00.222 --> 01:49:01.363]  People are waking up.
[01:49:02.104 --> 01:49:03.245]  They're angry about it.
[01:49:03.685 --> 01:49:08.289]  And another reason that, and this goes back to my point that Texas
[01:49:09.793 --> 01:49:11.874]  The elections in Texas are the key thing.
[01:49:11.894 --> 01:49:22.258]  You see, a lot of people in Texas were the very first people in the whole country to give their political loyalty and support to the Imperial Bush family.
[01:49:23.219 --> 01:49:24.980]  Because they believed in them.
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.480]  Stay there, we've got to break.
[01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:27.401]  This is a key point.
[01:49:27.421 --> 01:49:28.301]  We're going to take calls.
[01:49:28.341 --> 01:49:29.902]  We're going to keep him in until the next hour if he's got time.
[01:49:30.202 --> 01:49:30.602]  Stay with us.
[01:49:35.584 --> 01:49:38.746]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:49:39.127 --> 01:49:41.068]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:49:41.408 --> 01:49:49.074]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:49:49.754 --> 01:49:56.819]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:49:57.219 --> 01:50:04.084]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:50:04.577 --> 01:50:08.619]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:08.940 --> 01:50:12.422]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:12.902 --> 01:50:14.823]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:15.163 --> 01:50:19.066]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:34.921]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:50:35.242 --> 01:50:38.025]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:50:38.285 --> 01:50:42.450]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:50:42.890 --> 01:50:43.711]  So what do you do?
[01:50:44.032 --> 01:50:48.617]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:50:49.097 --> 01:50:51.180]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[01:51:32.032 --> 01:51:39.959]  For years you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained a leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.

[01:52:41.756 --> 01:52:44.018]  We'll be with us about 20 minutes, 30 minutes to the next hour.
[01:52:44.378 --> 01:52:45.539]  I know we've had callers holding.
[01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:50.103]  From even the hour before this one, on a host of issues.
[01:52:50.123 --> 01:52:52.505]  You don't have to put those headphones on yet, David.
[01:52:52.525 --> 01:52:53.325]  We're not going quite yet.
[01:52:53.946 --> 01:52:56.648]  But when we start the next hour, we are going to take your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:52:56.668 --> 01:53:03.513]  1-800-259-9231 for all of you that have been holding patiently.
[01:53:05.074 --> 01:53:10.578]  But, David, specifically this world government, the North American Union.
[01:53:10.618 --> 01:53:14.081]  I mean, SPP has admitted, even Lou Dobbs is saying, America as we know it is dying.
[01:53:14.938 --> 01:53:16.439]  Talk about reaching too far.
[01:53:16.459 --> 01:53:17.779]  I mean, this is like the Twilight Zone.
[01:53:17.799 --> 01:53:24.501]  Can you specifically speak to the North American Union and give us your take on the fact that this is unfolding?
[01:53:26.222 --> 01:53:28.003]  Well, let me start from a premise, Alex.
[01:53:29.403 --> 01:53:40.467]  The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States of America that were delivered to the world community 200 and some odd years ago
[01:53:43.473 --> 01:54:02.024]  are very special to me they're unique and they give me and all of my fellow Americans and Texans a remarkable panoply of rights and liberties and the ability to to live out one's life as one chooses
[01:54:03.203 --> 01:54:08.207]  Through constitutional democracy, constitutional government with checks and balances.
[01:54:08.727 --> 01:54:19.355]  Well that's real special to me and I don't want to lose it through my country giving up its sovereignty through mergers with other countries that don't have that tradition.
[01:54:19.495 --> 01:54:26.821]  And the key reason they're doing that, and I'd like you to elaborate on this because I know you're aware of it because you're a local lawyer involved in the government and what's happening.
[01:54:26.841 --> 01:54:28.202]  You've seen it first hand.
[01:54:29.190 --> 01:54:34.954]  The reason they want global government is so they can build a new system that doesn't have the checks and balances.
[01:54:34.974 --> 01:54:37.235]  You know, some of the liberals say, oh, we want a leathered world government.
[01:54:37.255 --> 01:54:43.019]  Folks, the point is, the people that push world government are doing it, and regional government, is because then it removes the local control.
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:48.703]  By creating the new institution, they are the founders, and then they can craft it in whatever image they want.
[01:55:00.274 --> 01:55:06.093]  Well, you see, a lot of people in Texas have been
[01:55:08.846 --> 01:55:12.710]  Through good hearts and through innocence and through convictions.
[01:55:13.270 --> 01:55:22.117]  A lot of people in Texas have been giving the Imperial Bush family their loyalty and support longer than anybody else in the country.
[01:55:22.557 --> 01:55:31.865]  And what's happening now is a lot of these good people in Texas who really believed that they were supporting moral leadership and character and all that.
[01:55:32.615 --> 01:55:43.762]  A lot of these good people in Texas, they're waking up to the fact that they've been lied to and betrayed, and it's making them very, very, very angry.
[01:55:44.443 --> 01:55:46.684]  Angrier than even a lot of Democrats.
[01:55:48.845 --> 01:55:49.186]  I agree.
[01:55:49.286 --> 01:55:52.328]  I'm on KLBJ 590 through Genesis.
[01:55:52.368 --> 01:55:55.089]  We've syndicated the show on Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:55:55.310 --> 01:55:56.590]  Big show coming up this weekend, by the way.
[01:55:56.610 --> 01:55:57.431]  Folks, be sure to join us.
[01:55:58.224 --> 01:56:00.025]  And I mean, I'm on that station.
[01:56:00.045 --> 01:56:04.608]  I'm on other big stations right now, which are conservative stations, but aren't big corporate owned.
[01:56:05.689 --> 01:56:11.473]  And maybe one caller every week calls in who disagrees, and they can't disagree on any of my facts.
[01:56:11.493 --> 01:56:12.493]  They just can't believe it.
[01:56:13.814 --> 01:56:21.139]  So yeah, I mean, to be on KLBJ, which has got all the neocon people listening, there really aren't neocons anymore.
[01:56:21.179 --> 01:56:23.020]  They now are all freaked out, though.
[01:56:23.060 --> 01:56:24.121]  They go, well, what do we do then?
[01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:26.841]  Well, they know the Democratic Party's corrupt, too.
[01:56:27.101 --> 01:56:52.468]  Well, you see, now, I'm a Democrat, and I'm proud to be a Democrat, but my loyalty is to the heritage and the historical principles and value system of the political party that was originally founded by Jefferson and Madison to be a counterpoint and to stand against the aristocracy that Alexander Hamilton wanted to turn the new republic into.
[01:56:53.274 --> 01:57:12.244]  But because of my loyalty to what the Democratic Party is really supposed to be about, and that's what I'm proud to be affiliated with, I don't get along very well with the elite of today's Democratic Party establishment.
[01:57:12.764 --> 01:57:17.007]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:28.529 --> 01:57:29.169]  Big Brother.
[01:57:29.830 --> 01:57:30.871]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:31.611 --> 01:57:32.712]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:33.373 --> 01:57:34.174]  You want answers?
[01:57:34.934 --> 01:57:35.835]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:35.855 --> 01:57:40.199]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:40.679 --> 01:57:44.823]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:57:47.385 --> 01:57:49.747]  We're already into the third and final 20 minutes.
[01:57:49.767 --> 01:57:50.648]  He's David Van Oss.
[01:57:51.428 --> 01:57:54.650]  And, Dave, before we go any further, give out your website.
[01:57:54.730 --> 01:57:57.572]  I mean, we have links to it up on Infowars.com, but give out your website.
[01:57:57.892 --> 01:58:00.534]  We're less than three weeks away now from November 7th.
[01:58:01.094 --> 01:58:03.696]  Tell us how folks can support you here in Texas for Attorney General.
[01:58:03.956 --> 01:58:12.602]  Promising to block, ladies and gentlemen, the Trans-Texas Corridor, which is the first cancer node of the North American Union.
[01:58:13.644 --> 01:58:18.787]  My website is www.vanossfortexasag.com.
[01:58:19.287 --> 01:58:21.128]  That's all lowercase run together.
[01:58:21.368 --> 01:58:32.353]  V as in Victor, A, N as in Nancy, O, S as in Sam, the word for F-O-R, then the word Texas, then A-G.
[01:58:32.814 --> 01:58:34.935]  Vanossfortexasag.com.
[01:58:35.355 --> 01:58:35.975]  Absolutely.
[01:58:36.095 --> 01:58:39.637]  You were trying to finish up, and then we're going to go to the calls, and I've got a whole bunch here.
[01:58:39.757 --> 01:58:40.317]  Who's up first?
[01:58:40.378 --> 01:58:42.178]  Charles, Rob, Steve, John, Bob?
[01:58:42.459 --> 01:58:43.159]  Who's up first here?
[01:58:44.022 --> 01:58:48.588]  Okay, we'll go to Charles who's been holding like a real trooper from San Diego for an hour, and then we'll get to everybody else.
[01:58:48.609 --> 01:58:52.854]  We'll have wide open phones after our guest leaves us for the last 40 minutes to cover some other important news.
[01:58:54.600 --> 01:58:56.762]  David, you're trying to finish up with the Establishment Democrats.
[01:58:56.802 --> 01:58:59.864]  They're owned by the same lobbyists, same system.
[01:59:00.224 --> 01:59:07.810]  Now, granted, they're not setting up a Hitlerian Reich, but Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton, they're all for the war, they're all for Bush.
[01:59:07.870 --> 01:59:09.931]  Hillary voted for the torture bill.
[01:59:11.032 --> 01:59:15.095]  But you're saying some of the Establishment Democrats, you don't get along with them too well.
[01:59:15.615 --> 01:59:21.600]  Well, what really infuriates me when you talk about some of those Democratic House and Senate members,
[01:59:22.404 --> 01:59:27.647]  In their hearts, they're really not for the war and the Bush agenda.
[01:59:28.107 --> 01:59:36.091]  But they don't have the guts and the plain old spine to follow what they know in their hearts is right.
[01:59:36.552 --> 01:59:38.813]  Because of their spinelessness and because
[01:59:39.514 --> 01:59:45.757]  They want to preserve their privileged positions in the beltway aristocracy.
[01:59:45.777 --> 01:59:47.717]  I mean, who cares about privileged positions?
[01:59:47.737 --> 01:59:57.561]  I mean, I'm not trying to sound like I'm some holier-than-thou disciple or something, but frankly, once you get enough possessions, they become a burden almost, and the status and the rest of it.
[01:59:57.581 --> 02:00:02.103]  I mean, my point is, there's nothing wrong with things, but what do they profit you if you lose your soul?
[02:00:02.523 --> 02:00:03.504]  That's exactly right.
[02:00:03.844 --> 02:00:05.624]  And people, you see, when I hear
[02:00:07.580 --> 02:00:22.190]  When I hear a politician say that, yeah, I know the really right thing to do would have been to vote this way, but I had to vote this way because my re-election campaign is coming up, I want to grab that politician
[02:00:24.043 --> 02:00:29.046]  Bob, I want to grab that politician by the neck and shake him and say, how dare you!
[02:00:29.527 --> 02:00:36.471]  You were not put here by the people to watch out and feather some kind of political career ambition of yours.
[02:00:36.831 --> 02:00:42.615]  You were put here to do the public's business, and that means you do, that means you call it the way you see it.
[02:00:42.875 --> 02:00:47.138]  When you know something is right or something is the right thing to do, that's what you do.
[02:00:47.678 --> 02:00:51.281]  Well, what they also do is they say, oh, I had to vote for this, so later they'd vote for that.
[02:00:51.821 --> 02:00:54.403]  And then all you get is a giant pork barrel of corruption.
[02:00:54.463 --> 02:00:55.584]  Everybody voting for everybody.
[02:00:55.804 --> 02:00:56.764]  Which is what Bush has done.
[02:00:56.784 --> 02:00:58.906]  I mean, he's vetoed only one bill.
[02:00:58.946 --> 02:01:04.970]  He just, every spending bill, every... I mean, he's spent more money than all presidents before him combined.
[02:01:04.990 --> 02:01:08.372]  And every time I bring that up to neocon followers, they can't deny it.
[02:01:08.412 --> 02:01:08.892]  They know it.
[02:01:09.233 --> 02:01:10.133]  And they say, so what?
[02:01:11.014 --> 02:01:12.735]  Well, and you know, it's interesting, Alex.
[02:01:12.775 --> 02:01:20.420]  I gotta put in a plug for my West Texas and East Texas farm and ranch friends.
[02:01:22.529 --> 02:01:37.234]  Bush is currently threatening to veto a bill that would provide billions of dollars of disaster relief for Texas farmers and ranchers to give them relief for the losses they've incurred as a result of several years of drought.
[02:01:37.875 --> 02:01:45.897]  And he's threatening to veto that and therefore the Republicans in the Congress have not let it out of the House Agriculture Committee.
[02:01:47.398 --> 02:01:47.718]  You see,
[02:01:48.536 --> 02:02:03.720]  Alex, I mean, everything you're talking about, the corruption at the top, now, I gotta say this, Alex, at the lower levels of government, there are a lot of real good people who do things out of good heart.
[02:02:03.780 --> 02:02:05.261]  No, I know that, I know that.
[02:02:05.541 --> 02:02:09.162]  At the upper echelons of our political system,
[02:02:10.137 --> 02:02:13.798]  Everything has gotten completely corrupted by... No, I know, I know.
[02:02:14.019 --> 02:02:14.819]  Stay there, we gotta break.
[02:02:14.859 --> 02:02:15.279]  No, I know.
[02:02:15.339 --> 02:02:17.940]  It's corruption gone to seed, as Gary Brownfield says.
[02:02:18.180 --> 02:02:18.700]  We're gonna come back.
[02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:19.501]  Go straight to your calls.
[02:02:19.561 --> 02:02:20.221]  Write your calls.
[02:02:20.241 --> 02:02:22.322]  Stay with us.
[02:02:23.042 --> 02:02:29.124]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:29.484 --> 02:02:31.425]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:31.785 --> 02:02:39.408]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:02:40.123 --> 02:02:47.168]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:02:47.568 --> 02:02:58.975]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:02:59.315 --> 02:03:02.878]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:03.278 --> 02:03:05.179]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:05.539 --> 02:03:09.382]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:11.203 --> 02:04:13.204]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[02:04:13.224 --> 02:04:15.206]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[02:04:15.226 --> 02:04:18.788]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[02:04:18.868 --> 02:04:20.769]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:04:38.712 --> 02:04:42.254]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:04:42.815 --> 02:04:46.978]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:04:47.518 --> 02:04:50.520]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:04:51.481 --> 02:04:54.403]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:04:55.123 --> 02:04:57.205]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:04:57.225 --> 02:04:59.566]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[02:05:08.741 --> 02:05:09.022]  U.S.
[02:05:09.122 --> 02:05:12.007]  debt bubble, red alert, and real estate crash.
[02:05:13.009 --> 02:05:20.864]  Call 888-XANADU, that's 888-XANADU, and ask for George.
[02:05:34.762 --> 02:05:44.648]  From Nazareth he came with a rag-tag band to bring a revolution.
[02:05:45.889 --> 02:05:52.452]  Some would make him king, others couldn't stand that.
[02:05:53.953 --> 02:05:59.797]  The cost was a solution, but he rose again.
[02:06:01.745 --> 02:06:06.289]  Wise men follow him, but he'll know no music here.
[02:06:07.811 --> 02:06:12.615]  Wise men follow him, thank God for the renegades!
[02:06:26.218 --> 02:06:28.379]  Lord knows where we'd be.
[02:06:28.559 --> 02:06:40.926]  When it comes to heroes, renegades are mine.
[02:06:45.168 --> 02:06:50.331]  They railed against the crown with another rag-tag band.
[02:06:51.454 --> 02:06:54.076]  We're free today.
[02:06:54.436 --> 02:07:10.867]  And George Bush and the New World Order criminals that worked with Hitler, I mean, these people could not be any worse.
[02:07:19.907 --> 02:07:22.112]  This song, my friends, says it all.
[02:07:22.152 --> 02:07:25.018]  They laid their lives down for liberty and freedom and now what do we have?
[02:07:25.058 --> 02:07:28.485]  A bunch of criminals, like Bush, running this country in the ground.
[02:07:28.525 --> 02:07:29.106]  Keep it rolling.
[02:07:44.055 --> 02:07:44.615]  Think about it.
[02:07:44.876 --> 02:07:53.563]  George Bush's grandfather, the father of the former president, worked to destroy this country, worked for the Nazis, and all he is is a high-level puppet of these globalists.
[02:07:54.083 --> 02:08:03.631]  Handing over 8,000 miles of roads to a Spanish company, trying to put transponders in all of our cars to tax us and trace us, militarizing our police.
[02:08:04.271 --> 02:08:05.492]  It's a sick joke.
[02:08:06.193 --> 02:08:07.274]  Alright, we're gonna go to your calls.
[02:08:08.911 --> 02:08:12.154]  We're going to go to Charles and Steve and John and Bob and Richard and others.
[02:08:12.895 --> 02:08:14.856]  But let's let the song roll out the rest of the way.
[02:08:14.917 --> 02:08:16.498]  Where are the renegades in the world today?
[02:08:28.590 --> 02:08:33.231]  Welcome back, my friends.
[02:08:34.651 --> 02:08:39.212]  We should all be angry.
[02:08:39.232 --> 02:08:41.192]  We should all be upset.
[02:08:57.430 --> 02:09:01.912]  And David Vanoss, running for Texas Attorney General on the Democratic ticket, has a really good chance.
[02:09:01.932 --> 02:09:05.493]  The press is reporting he could beat the current incumbent creature.
[02:09:06.033 --> 02:09:09.774]  And he just handed me a note saying the founders of Texas in 1836 were all renegades.
[02:09:10.134 --> 02:09:11.095]  Well, absolutely.
[02:09:11.195 --> 02:09:12.175]  Davy Crockett and...
[02:09:12.791 --> 02:09:14.732]  Travis and all of them, absolutely.
[02:09:14.752 --> 02:09:17.172]  I had family in the Texas Revolution.
[02:09:17.252 --> 02:09:20.693]  Most people who had family here at the time were in the Texas Revolution.
[02:09:20.914 --> 02:09:23.574]  And the media tries to steal Hispanics' heritage.
[02:09:23.894 --> 02:09:29.816]  They like to try to brainwash Hispanics into not knowing that they're part of Texas' heritage just as much as anybody else.
[02:09:29.876 --> 02:09:34.077]  And so we're all renegades, as Texans, as Americans, and we're going to defeat the New World Order.
[02:09:34.298 --> 02:09:35.758]  They've bitten off more than they can chew.
[02:09:35.778 --> 02:09:37.439]  What did you think of that song, David?
[02:09:38.079 --> 02:09:38.879]  Oh, I thought it was great.
[02:09:39.508 --> 02:09:41.949]  Let's go ahead and go to Jack Blood real quick here.
[02:09:41.969 --> 02:09:44.710]  I wanted to invite him on for some comments, and we will go to your calls.
[02:09:44.750 --> 02:09:48.431]  Jack Blood comes on right after my broadcast daily here on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:09:48.511 --> 02:09:49.231]  Jack, how are you doing?
[02:09:49.491 --> 02:09:50.172]  Hey, good, Alex.
[02:09:50.212 --> 02:09:51.812]  Thanks for having David Van Oz on.
[02:09:51.852 --> 02:09:57.814]  You guys are definitely renegades, and you're going to bring, I think, good attention back to this state, which we really need.
[02:09:57.834 --> 02:10:01.375]  You know, Alex, I've been following David Van Oz for the last year.
[02:10:01.395 --> 02:10:06.597]  We vetted him in front of the statehouse where he read the names of all who died at the Alamo
[02:10:07.337 --> 02:10:08.839]  I really believe in what he's doing.
[02:10:08.879 --> 02:10:12.622]  I really trust him, and I think we can really do a good job putting him in office.
[02:10:12.642 --> 02:10:15.564]  We have to put him in, over and above everybody else.
[02:10:15.644 --> 02:10:29.436]  And if people could, you know, get out to people who are already registered to vote, and get them, you know, to know about David Van Oz, if we can, you know, volunteer for his campaign here in these crucial next couple of weeks, I think we're going to be really happy with what we get with Mr. Van Oz.
[02:10:30.089 --> 02:10:30.769]  Well, absolutely.
[02:10:30.830 --> 02:10:35.072]  Texans have big hearts and a lot of them got fooled by Bush and his phony conservatism.
[02:10:35.813 --> 02:10:40.556]  He's not even a Texan and I'm not blaming Maine and Kennebunkport and Connecticut.
[02:10:40.596 --> 02:10:44.698]  It's just that he's a total phony like somebody going up to Connecticut and claiming they're from Connecticut.
[02:10:45.078 --> 02:10:46.459]  Everything about this guy is phony.
[02:10:46.499 --> 02:10:47.180]  It's like whenever
[02:10:47.780 --> 02:10:51.605]  In fact, I've been on national shows and people call in and go, you're a shame to be a Texan.
[02:10:51.866 --> 02:10:53.728]  We're a shame to you, you liberal.
[02:10:53.928 --> 02:10:54.870]  We love Bush.
[02:10:55.190 --> 02:10:56.852]  You know, and I say, you know something?
[02:10:57.533 --> 02:11:03.260]  George Bush from Vicente Fox came up here and thought it was a real ranch because they're real, you know, cowboys down there in Mexico.
[02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:04.102]  That's where it all started.
[02:11:04.762 --> 02:11:05.622]  No, I wasn't aware of that.
[02:11:05.662 --> 02:11:09.404]  That is absolutely, well it's not a surprise knowing who these people are, but it is
[02:11:34.770 --> 02:11:35.210]  Chuckie.
[02:11:35.650 --> 02:11:42.751]  Well yeah, I mean they said we're allowed to torture people until death, if we didn't kill them on purpose it's okay, and they said yes, we can even torture children in front of their parents.
[02:11:44.092 --> 02:11:47.732]  Alex, I gotta say, I love a Democrat who's pro-Second Amendment.
[02:11:47.832 --> 02:11:48.692]  Oh yeah, tell us about that.
[02:11:48.712 --> 02:11:50.973]  You know, you're really going to keep these people in line.
[02:11:51.033 --> 02:11:55.594]  I want to get off the air and let other people comment and let David Van Os comment, and I want to thank you, David.
[02:11:55.654 --> 02:11:59.454]  If I could, Alex, real quick, just throw a plug out for our People's 9-11 website.
[02:11:59.774 --> 02:12:02.355]  That is peoplefor911justice.com.
[02:12:02.395 --> 02:12:03.555]  It's a central location.
[02:12:03.575 --> 02:12:04.916]  It's a MySpace format.
[02:12:04.936 --> 02:12:05.696]  I went and checked it out.
[02:12:05.736 --> 02:12:06.316]  It's great, Jack.
[02:12:06.376 --> 02:12:07.096]  Free blogs.
[02:12:07.116 --> 02:12:08.417]  You can set up a free profile.
[02:12:08.437 --> 02:12:09.677]  We've got a lot of people over there.
[02:12:09.698 --> 02:12:16.380]  It's a great place for your listeners to go plug what they're doing and to work with other people in the 9-11 movement, a central location.
[02:12:16.700 --> 02:12:18.981]  I'm the custodian of it right now, Alex.
[02:12:19.001 --> 02:12:21.802]  So it's peoplefor911justice.com.
[02:12:21.882 --> 02:12:23.283]  All your listeners go sign up.
[02:12:23.503 --> 02:12:25.444]  And I hope all your listeners support David Van Oz.
[02:12:25.484 --> 02:12:27.165]  David, I'll look forward to talking to you soon, sir.
[02:12:27.245 --> 02:12:27.825]  Absolutely.
[02:12:28.045 --> 02:12:29.306]  And then we've got to go to the calls.
[02:12:29.346 --> 02:12:32.227]  But David, you're going to be giving a speech at 4 o'clock today.
[02:12:32.247 --> 02:12:32.767]  Tell folks where.
[02:12:33.511 --> 02:12:38.157]  Uh, in front of the Travis County Courthouse, uh, on Guadalupe Street.
[02:12:38.878 --> 02:12:44.746]  Uh, it will be the 254th and final courthouse speech in my
[02:12:45.515 --> 02:12:50.399]  Whistle-stop tour of the 254 counties of Texas that I've been doing since April.
[02:12:50.619 --> 02:13:02.547]  And you've signed an affidavit that if elected Attorney General, you will, with all of your legal powers granted to you by the great Constitution of the state of Texas, you will go in and block them and ban the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[02:13:02.928 --> 02:13:07.111]  I will use every legal means available to me by that office
[02:13:07.771 --> 02:13:13.172]  Yeah, thanks for taking this call and I'm honored to be talking to two gentlemen like yourself.
[02:13:13.192 --> 02:13:17.593]  This is my first time listening as well as a first time caller and I would like to say that
[02:13:37.489 --> 02:13:40.450]  What's important here is what both of you have said.
[02:13:40.810 --> 02:13:44.791]  There's not much that I can bring up that you haven't spoke on that is true.
[02:13:45.251 --> 02:13:52.992]  And the fact that you're speaking truth makes you a threat to those who are pretending and perpetrating to be true Americans.
[02:13:53.793 --> 02:14:05.275]  Now, what I would like to say to David is for him to continue to fight for that position because the corruption in our court system, the attorney generals and a few judges,
[02:14:06.597 --> 02:14:09.619]  It's worth causing the problem for us locally.
[02:14:10.479 --> 02:14:17.383]  Locally, the grassroots people, we are the heart of America and we do make this country function.
[02:14:17.944 --> 02:14:20.425]  And right now, we are suffering the most.
[02:14:20.505 --> 02:14:29.991]  We are the ones who are targeted and our families, which I hear on your program, Alex, since I've been listening here, is the family is the primary focus.
[02:14:30.638 --> 02:14:51.017]  What I would like to hear David speak on also, as well as what I heard him speak on here, is the family matter issues within the family courts, because that's one of the biggest slaveries that they got going, where they capture our children, and they take them in and they incorporate them into these families, and they just change these children.
[02:14:51.037 --> 02:14:56.062]  It's like you were saying, in Nazi time, they make... That's right, two-thirds plus
[02:14:56.862 --> 02:15:00.626]  The Attorney General of Texas administers the child support enforcement.
[02:15:21.269 --> 02:15:50.047]  uh... program enforcing child support decrees and what the current attorney general does is that he handles that in a very adversary manner so as to try to give himself good statistics on how much money he's collected so he can use those statistics to brag about himself in his uh... weekly self-congratulatory press releases and so what what he does by doing things that way is he makes the anguish
[02:15:50.888 --> 02:16:01.800]  Well, I know families where the ex-husband's been in a car wreck, the woman says it's okay if he doesn't pay for a few months, and they still come after him.
[02:16:08.101 --> 02:16:08.822]  We're good to go.
[02:16:21.889 --> 02:16:39.646]  The child support program that the Attorney General administers, when I get to be Attorney General, it's going to be used in a humane manner that treats people as individuals and not as just computerized statistics and that uses that system to try to make the family relationships
[02:16:40.786 --> 02:16:45.990]  To try to improve and resuscitate the family relationships for the benefit of the children.
[02:16:46.290 --> 02:16:47.351]  Thank you for the call, Charles.
[02:16:47.391 --> 02:16:47.731]  Thank you.
[02:16:47.751 --> 02:16:48.812]  Good to have you on board with us.
[02:16:48.852 --> 02:16:56.917]  Steve, John, Bob, Richard, and others will get to your calls after this break with the man who's running for Texas Attorney General.
[02:16:57.377 --> 02:17:02.380]  And he has sworn at every county seat in the state.
[02:17:02.400 --> 02:17:08.164]  Well, the final one today at 4 o'clock here in Austin coming to the capital county last.
[02:17:09.334 --> 02:17:19.633]  Uh, to, to, to, you know, frontally assault the globalists that are setting up the North American Union and they want to use Texas as their main heart or blood supply.
[02:17:19.674 --> 02:17:20.215]  We'll be right back.

[02:18:30.138 --> 02:18:34.941]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:18:35.161 --> 02:18:37.902]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:18:37.942 --> 02:18:39.063]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:18:40.404 --> 02:18:45.006]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:18:45.926 --> 02:18:53.130]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.

[02:21:31.643 --> 02:21:34.544]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Texas.
[02:21:34.564 --> 02:21:35.325]  Steve, you're on the air.
[02:21:35.345 --> 02:21:36.525]  Go ahead.
[02:21:36.545 --> 02:21:38.546]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:21:39.146 --> 02:21:41.827]  I wanted to share a couple of quick experiences.
[02:21:41.927 --> 02:21:45.769]  I'm in one of the hotbeds that you're talking about, which is Houston, the Houston area.
[02:21:47.330 --> 02:21:49.531]  Recently, I went to a neighbor of mine.
[02:21:49.651 --> 02:21:52.872]  I got the 5-pack year videos, including Terror Storm,
[02:21:53.413 --> 02:21:53.673]  I don't
[02:22:08.930 --> 02:22:10.372]  Is that what this is about?
[02:22:10.412 --> 02:22:11.633]  And this knee-jerk reaction?
[02:22:11.694 --> 02:22:12.434]  I said, wait a minute.
[02:22:12.474 --> 02:22:15.458]  Why don't you just at least listen to what the guys are saying?
[02:22:15.478 --> 02:22:16.719]  I ain't going to believe it.
[02:22:16.759 --> 02:22:18.141]  And so I couldn't show it at all.
[02:22:18.161 --> 02:22:24.127]  The other thing I wanted to say is, I don't know, Alex, if you've had the chance.
[02:22:24.908 --> 02:22:28.392]  There's a local talk show host here named Pat Gray on 950KPRC.
[02:22:30.712 --> 02:22:32.774]  And he's at the Clear Channel station.
[02:22:32.934 --> 02:22:36.036]  I think Clear Channel pretty much runs the airwaves in this area.
[02:22:36.056 --> 02:22:37.658]  They've got like 13 stations.
[02:22:38.718 --> 02:22:47.005]  And you've brought out, documented how they were involved with the cover-up in the 2004 election in your American Dictators DVD, which was excellent.
[02:22:47.045 --> 02:22:50.568]  But I've been going back and forth with this guy, Pat.
[02:22:51.124 --> 02:22:53.906]  Gray, asking him to have you on his show.
[02:22:54.807 --> 02:23:03.354]  In an email I got from him on the 18th, he says, I invited Alex Jones on my show to debate this for one hour on any day he chooses.
[02:23:03.734 --> 02:23:06.316]  I extended this invitation to him last Friday.
[02:23:06.376 --> 02:23:09.138]  Guess what I've heard back from your brave frontline warrior?
[02:23:09.539 --> 02:23:09.959]  Nothing.
[02:23:10.399 --> 02:23:11.200]  Okay, well let me be clear.
[02:23:11.260 --> 02:23:15.804]  We get, no exaggeration, tens of thousands of emails now a week.
[02:23:16.004 --> 02:23:16.985]  It sounds ridiculous.
[02:23:17.485 --> 02:23:19.807]  We actually have gotten 10,000 emails in a week before.
[02:23:20.168 --> 02:23:21.048]  So we miss stuff.
[02:23:21.148 --> 02:23:26.133]  Give him Kevin at InfoWars.com or Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[02:23:26.913 --> 02:23:33.335]  And you tell him that, I mean, if he tried to send it to, say, Alex or something, that email's even been shut down.
[02:23:33.375 --> 02:23:37.876]  It just crashed with so many, it was like 50,000 emails in it or something from like a month.
[02:23:38.977 --> 02:23:40.297]  Or give him my office number.
[02:23:40.317 --> 02:23:40.897]  Give him this number, 512-291-5750.
[02:23:40.937 --> 02:23:43.658]  You tell him to call 512-291-5750 and I'll come on and debate him.
[02:23:43.718 --> 02:23:44.418]  Give me a break.
[02:23:44.438 --> 02:23:47.619]  I debate people all the time and he's claiming I'm afraid to.
[02:23:53.121 --> 02:23:56.605]  And the other thing I just want to mention, I got an email from him just today.
[02:23:56.986 --> 02:23:59.068]  And he says, I've addressed all this on the air.
[02:23:59.108 --> 02:24:00.550]  Real experts have addressed it.
[02:24:00.610 --> 02:24:02.412]  Investigations have been conducted.
[02:24:02.432 --> 02:24:03.112]  Does it matter?
[02:24:03.173 --> 02:24:03.993]  You're insane.
[02:24:04.334 --> 02:24:08.759]  You don't believe anything but the psycho ramblings of this freak who won't come on my show.
[02:24:09.218 --> 02:24:12.060]  And then he mentions Skull and Bones and how he's addressed it.
[02:24:12.080 --> 02:24:12.921]  That scares him.
[02:24:13.301 --> 02:24:19.406]  But then he says, even the fact that CNN or MSNBC or the major networks would cover up anything like this.
[02:24:19.546 --> 02:24:33.276]  Okay, but listen, instead of talking about this little nobody talk show host, just, I mean, if the weasel wants me to come on and debate him, give him my office number and tell him we obviously missed his email or he sent it to the wrong place, and tell him that if he wants to debate me, that's fine.
[02:24:33.296 --> 02:24:34.377]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:24:34.937 --> 02:24:37.359]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Virginia.
[02:24:37.419 --> 02:24:38.160]  John, you're on the air.
[02:24:38.180 --> 02:24:38.520]  Go ahead.
[02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:40.401]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:24:41.502 --> 02:24:51.589]  Earlier on the program a caller called in and made a good point about how the Lord encourages us to exercise our right to keep and bear arms, namely with the sword back then of course.
[02:24:53.430 --> 02:24:56.333]  You talked about the importance of taking things in context.
[02:24:57.193 --> 02:25:05.199]  It's important to remember how his disciples replied to him when he said that you should sell your garment to buy a sword if you can't afford one.
[02:25:05.758 --> 02:25:07.819]  They said, Lord, look, here are two swords.
[02:25:07.899 --> 02:25:11.101]  And this was before the evil priests were slandering him.
[02:25:11.481 --> 02:25:15.503]  And he said, reply to them, the Lord replied to them, it is enough.
[02:25:16.423 --> 02:25:21.045]  When those around him saw what was going to happen, they said to him, Lord, shall we strike with the sword?
[02:25:21.105 --> 02:25:24.227]  And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.
[02:25:24.247 --> 02:25:28.029]  But Jesus answered and said... Yeah, he put the ear back on.
[02:25:28.069 --> 02:25:30.590]  The point is, Christ wanted to be the sacrifice there.
[02:25:30.970 --> 02:25:32.531]  He was giving himself unto them.
[02:25:33.118 --> 02:25:36.700]  Okay, so it's a time to live, a time to die, a time to sow, a time to reap.
[02:25:37.261 --> 02:25:38.822]  I mean, what are you getting at here?
[02:25:38.842 --> 02:25:40.963]  Well, that's precisely my point.
[02:25:41.003 --> 02:25:48.948]  I'm getting at the fact that Jesus paid our price, and it's not our responsibility to fight evil.
[02:25:49.569 --> 02:25:50.790]  It's the Lord paid our price.
[02:25:51.550 --> 02:25:52.531]  Excuse me?
[02:25:52.851 --> 02:25:53.751]  Excuse me?
[02:25:54.412 --> 02:25:55.132]  Thank you for the call.
[02:25:55.192 --> 02:25:56.053]  I really appreciate that.
[02:25:56.513 --> 02:25:57.494]  You're shaking your head, David.
[02:25:58.186 --> 02:25:59.507]  I just didn't understand the point.
[02:26:00.107 --> 02:26:01.628]  It's a religion of laying down.
[02:26:01.688 --> 02:26:02.869]  It's a false Christianity.
[02:26:03.209 --> 02:26:03.749]  It's a cult.
[02:26:04.370 --> 02:26:07.391]  And most Americans that consider themselves to be Christians now are in it.
[02:26:07.691 --> 02:26:09.693]  And it's a religion of, I don't have to fight evil.
[02:26:09.773 --> 02:26:10.473]  I can lay down.
[02:26:10.493 --> 02:26:11.794]  I don't have to get involved.
[02:26:11.814 --> 02:26:14.535]  And they just mantra it as a mantra.
[02:26:15.056 --> 02:26:18.437]  And no matter what you say to them or do, it's a cult.
[02:26:18.597 --> 02:26:22.940]  Well, it's a dead gum good thing Thomas Jefferson and George Washington weren't part of that cult.
[02:26:25.384 --> 02:26:25.805]  I hear you.
[02:26:26.065 --> 02:26:31.989]  Listen, sir, I'm really impressed with you and I will be voting for you even though Hardener Civic runs Travis County.
[02:26:32.830 --> 02:26:37.313]  It's very questionable if there is voting here, but I know there's real voting in other parts of the state.
[02:26:37.354 --> 02:26:42.758]  And if we're going to make them steal it, we should make them steal it right out in the open so everybody should get out there and vote for you.
[02:26:42.878 --> 02:26:43.979]  And give that website out again.
[02:26:44.819 --> 02:26:49.643]  www.vanossfortexasag.com I've really enjoyed this, Alex.
[02:26:49.723 --> 02:26:50.784]  It was an honor to be here.
[02:26:50.844 --> 02:26:51.324]  Well, thank you.
[02:26:51.344 --> 02:26:53.486]  If folks miss the email address or the website,
[02:26:54.261 --> 02:26:57.725]  We have it linked up at the top of InfoWars.com right now.
[02:26:58.025 --> 02:26:59.227]  Mr. Van Ons, Godspeed!
[02:26:59.587 --> 02:26:59.987]  Yes, sir.
[02:27:00.047 --> 02:27:00.548]  Same to you.
[02:27:00.628 --> 02:27:01.649]  Nice to meet you in person.
[02:27:01.909 --> 02:27:02.230]  Thank you.
[02:27:02.250 --> 02:27:03.932]  Heard a lot of good things about you, and they were all true.
[02:27:04.292 --> 02:27:04.873]  Oh, my gosh.
[02:27:04.893 --> 02:27:05.954]  You're a good exaggerator.
[02:27:05.974 --> 02:27:07.395]  Thank you very much, sir.
[02:27:09.438 --> 02:27:10.359]  We're on the march.
[02:27:10.819 --> 02:27:12.441]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:13.342 --> 02:27:16.045]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:21.044 --> 02:27:25.166]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:27:25.386 --> 02:27:27.147]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:27:27.427 --> 02:27:33.709]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:27:33.990 --> 02:27:40.112]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:27:40.372 --> 02:27:42.193]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:27:42.473 --> 02:27:42.833]  I think so.
[02:28:04.970 --> 02:28:07.172]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:28:07.192 --> 02:28:11.536]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:28:11.676 --> 02:28:16.260]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:28:31.773 --> 02:28:40.700]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:28:40.900 --> 02:28:44.543]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:28:44.823 --> 02:28:49.847]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:28:50.148 --> 02:28:56.873]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:28:57.373 --> 02:28:57.894]  What about you?
[02:28:58.653 --> 02:29:03.995]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:29:19.750 --> 02:29:22.311]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:29:22.471 --> 02:29:24.632]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:29:24.913 --> 02:29:34.998]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[02:29:35.318 --> 02:29:37.639]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.

[02:30:21.309 --> 02:30:27.412]  Well, the union's a big business band, and they're going down like a dinosaur.
[02:30:27.612 --> 02:30:38.896]  Well, they used to grow food in Kansas, and they want to grow it on the moon, did you know?
[02:30:39.077 --> 02:30:44.439]  I can see the day coming when even your home gardener's gonna be in the lawn.
[02:30:57.325 --> 02:31:08.812]  See my pussy don't rule the world.
[02:31:09.553 --> 02:31:13.315]  You better get that in your head.
[02:31:13.515 --> 02:31:19.779]  This world is ruled by violence.
[02:31:19.879 --> 02:31:24.602]  But I guess that's better left unsaid.
[02:31:54.224 --> 02:31:54.965]  Welcome back.
[02:31:55.145 --> 02:31:56.545]  Sundown on the Union.
[02:31:56.605 --> 02:31:58.606]  We're trying to fight it as hard as we can.
[02:31:58.626 --> 02:32:03.908]  We don't care if you're a Republican, a Libertarian, a Constitutional Party, a Democrat, it doesn't matter.
[02:32:04.569 --> 02:32:07.710]  You want to step up to the plate and fight the New World Order, we stand with you.
[02:32:08.633 --> 02:32:09.833]  We're going to continue taking calls.
[02:32:09.873 --> 02:32:22.257]  I want to recap and cover more news on another senior former CIA agent, a big Republican, going public saying from the analysis he's done from the research of Tarpley and others that he believes 9-11 is an inside job.
[02:32:22.377 --> 02:32:24.137]  Also some other key news here.
[02:32:25.338 --> 02:32:28.098]  But listen to that Bob Dylan song.
[02:32:28.419 --> 02:32:32.380]  I can see a day when even a home garden is going to be against the law.
[02:32:33.980 --> 02:32:35.300]  And let's not lie to ourselves.
[02:32:35.320 --> 02:32:36.941]  This world is run on violence.
[02:32:37.839 --> 02:32:39.600]  That is exactly what we're facing.
[02:32:39.620 --> 02:32:43.063]  We need to stop being naive and get down to the nitty-gritty.
[02:32:43.083 --> 02:32:49.628]  You know, these people call in here, and they've been calling more and more, because I don't even know why they listen to this show.
[02:32:50.749 --> 02:32:51.890]  I'm not here to make friends.
[02:32:51.930 --> 02:32:53.611]  I'm not here to win a popularity contest.
[02:32:53.932 --> 02:32:55.253]  I'm here to defend this republic.
[02:32:55.593 --> 02:32:59.496]  This is life and death for me, folks, and it is for you, too, even if you haven't figured this out.
[02:33:00.994 --> 02:33:06.438]  And I just get so sick of people calling in, claiming they're Christian, and then saying, we are not to fight evil.
[02:33:06.498 --> 02:33:08.439]  And he actually said, we are not to fight evil.
[02:33:08.920 --> 02:33:10.141]  What's the Proverbs verse?
[02:33:10.161 --> 02:33:14.023]  Let me see if somebody will call in and tell me that says, who will stand up for me against the wicked ones?
[02:33:15.164 --> 02:33:17.085]  I mean, I've read almost the entire Bible.
[02:33:17.226 --> 02:33:20.068]  Okay, this is not a Bible-thumping program either.
[02:33:20.108 --> 02:33:23.590]  See, all those Bible-thumpers will tell you to lay down to world government.
[02:33:23.610 --> 02:33:24.491]  They're a bunch of demons!
[02:33:25.251 --> 02:33:30.395]  Okay, I love God, and I love goodness, and I love innocence, and I love honor, and I love doing the right thing.
[02:33:31.141 --> 02:33:31.521]  Okay?
[02:33:31.881 --> 02:33:32.962]  I can't help what I do.
[02:33:33.022 --> 02:33:34.322]  I'm just a regular person.
[02:33:34.363 --> 02:33:35.163]  I'm not perfect.
[02:33:35.903 --> 02:33:38.604]  And I don't want to be associated with the phony Christians of this country.
[02:33:39.565 --> 02:33:40.725]  I mean, you people make me sick.
[02:33:41.646 --> 02:33:43.387]  And I don't even know what to say to it.
[02:33:44.327 --> 02:33:47.809]  And we've had two calls today, and a call yesterday, and a call the day before that.
[02:33:48.329 --> 02:33:52.030]  Different people calling in, saying we should lay down and we shouldn't fight evil.
[02:33:54.031 --> 02:33:56.032]  And they take Romans 13 out of context.
[02:33:56.072 --> 02:33:59.814]  They take what happened at the Garden of Gethsemane out of context.
[02:34:00.963 --> 02:34:03.804]  I mean, you know, it's ridiculous.
[02:34:04.844 --> 02:34:06.444]  It's absolutely ridiculous.
[02:34:07.065 --> 02:34:09.165]  And Christ did it all and we don't have to fight evil.
[02:34:09.225 --> 02:34:10.365]  What does that mean?
[02:34:11.506 --> 02:34:13.106]  What on earth are you talking about?
[02:34:13.126 --> 02:34:14.726]  I mean, you're cult members.
[02:34:14.746 --> 02:34:17.467]  You people, I don't know, just randomly opened the Bible.
[02:34:17.507 --> 02:34:20.288]  The whole thing's about everybody got arrested.
[02:34:20.328 --> 02:34:28.910]  Everybody got thrown in furnaces or lion's dens or hung upside down or boiled in oil or crucified or tortured or imprisoned or had their heads chopped off.
[02:34:29.711 --> 02:34:32.732]  I mean, what did John the Baptist do?
[02:34:32.772 --> 02:34:35.373]  He marched into Herod and said, you're a degenerate piece of filth!
[02:34:35.733 --> 02:34:37.033]  You're an oppressor of the people!
[02:34:37.974 --> 02:34:39.434]  And what did Herod say?
[02:34:39.474 --> 02:34:40.794]  He said, chop his head off!
[02:34:43.875 --> 02:34:44.536]  Everybody!
[02:34:44.596 --> 02:34:52.618]  I mean, what, eleven of the twelve disciples were murdered by government because they refused to kneel and worship the gods of that government because they refused to follow the criminal laws?
[02:34:55.075 --> 02:34:56.876]  Again, we call ourselves a Christian nation.
[02:34:56.916 --> 02:34:57.817]  You have been beguiled.
[02:34:57.837 --> 02:35:01.360]  The globalists bought off and took over the churches in the last hundred years.
[02:35:01.400 --> 02:35:04.682]  It was the churches that led the war against the British.
[02:35:05.002 --> 02:35:08.385]  It was the churches that led the war with Andrew Jackson against the British.
[02:35:09.065 --> 02:35:09.986]  They're at New Orleans.
[02:35:10.466 --> 02:35:13.428]  I don't know what Bible you're reading out of.
[02:35:13.729 --> 02:35:15.570]  You make me sick!
[02:35:17.471 --> 02:35:19.253]  You are pathetic scum!
[02:35:23.174 --> 02:35:28.718]  And if you don't like that, you know what, it's just how I feel, and would you rather me lie to you and go, oh I believe you're wrong.
[02:35:28.778 --> 02:35:34.061]  And you call in here and you say, quote, we are not to fight evil.
[02:35:36.263 --> 02:35:41.446]  That statement is just, it's a cop out and I don't like it.
[02:35:43.207 --> 02:35:46.549]  I mean really, I just want to slap you upside the head, I really do.
[02:35:48.691 --> 02:35:52.073]  You're to be the salt of the earth, you're to be out there fighting evil and corruption.
[02:35:52.890 --> 02:35:58.311]  And number one, it's a great gift and a blessing to be out fighting evil and the persecution and all of it is a blessing.
[02:35:58.691 --> 02:36:00.171]  You are to be persecuted!
[02:36:00.551 --> 02:36:01.792]  You're not to be of the world.
[02:36:01.812 --> 02:36:03.472]  You're not to go along with this system.
[02:36:04.172 --> 02:36:06.492]  You're to be out there speaking out against it and fighting it.
[02:36:06.773 --> 02:36:09.633]  But you don't help when your neighbor has the CPS taking their kids.
[02:36:09.833 --> 02:36:13.254]  You don't even go give them legal advice or try to help them or give them a place to stay.
[02:36:13.614 --> 02:36:15.774]  No, I'm not supposed to do anything.
[02:36:16.034 --> 02:36:20.315]  They must not have been with the Lord properly or God would have protected them.
[02:36:23.286 --> 02:36:26.048]  Trust in God, but tie up your camel, as the old Bedouin saying.
[02:36:26.068 --> 02:36:27.628]  There's another one.
[02:36:29.269 --> 02:36:31.591]  Pray, but row away from the rocks.
[02:36:31.611 --> 02:36:35.212]  I think that was a Hunter S. Thompson saying.
[02:36:35.513 --> 02:36:37.734]  Yeah, pray to God, but also row away from the rocks.
[02:36:37.794 --> 02:36:47.359]  If you're in a boat going towards rocks, and you say, I'm just going to pray and hope God doesn't make this boat run into the rocks, you're going to get a rude awakening.
[02:36:47.379 --> 02:36:49.220]  You're going to run right into those rocks, you idiot.
[02:36:51.525 --> 02:36:55.890]  And you think you're gonna, you know what, people like you, you're gonna thumb scan, aren't you, to get your food.
[02:36:55.910 --> 02:36:57.011]  You're gonna let your kids thumb scan.
[02:36:57.211 --> 02:36:58.633]  I bet your kids are in public school.
[02:36:59.033 --> 02:37:00.615]  I bet you got them hopped up on Ritalin.
[02:37:00.855 --> 02:37:02.477]  Well, it must be what God wants.
[02:37:02.517 --> 02:37:03.198]  You know what you do?
[02:37:03.438 --> 02:37:06.782]  What you do is what the extreme Buddhists and Hindus do.
[02:37:07.967 --> 02:37:09.368]  Because a lot of brands of them don't.
[02:37:09.848 --> 02:37:19.913]  They're in India, where people starve to death and die on the streets every day, where the cows walk around, defouling the streets, where no one cares if there's corruption, because that's just the way it is.
[02:37:19.973 --> 02:37:20.713]  You can't fight it.
[02:37:20.753 --> 02:37:25.776]  We'll be around again, and it's not our duty to fight, you know, anything and be involved.
[02:37:26.196 --> 02:37:30.998]  I mean, really, that is an extreme eastern view that you have.
[02:37:32.539 --> 02:37:33.399]  I just can't believe it.
[02:37:34.700 --> 02:37:36.381]  I just cannot believe it anymore.
[02:37:37.136 --> 02:37:37.996]  I'm going to move quick, folks.
[02:37:38.116 --> 02:37:39.236]  It doesn't matter how good your calls are.
[02:37:39.256 --> 02:37:40.197]  We've got to get to the next person.
[02:37:40.237 --> 02:37:41.037]  It's Catch-22.
[02:37:41.897 --> 02:37:42.737]  Who's up next here?
[02:37:43.897 --> 02:37:44.637]  Bob in Texas.
[02:37:44.657 --> 02:37:45.277]  Go ahead, Bob.
[02:37:45.297 --> 02:37:47.838]  Hey, Alex.
[02:37:48.398 --> 02:37:49.678]  Your favorite friend.
[02:37:55.639 --> 02:37:56.099]  Somebody.
[02:37:56.939 --> 02:38:00.020]  Yeah, you will recognize him.
[02:38:01.460 --> 02:38:03.681]  The only friend, my end.
[02:38:04.301 --> 02:38:05.281]  What did they do to him?
[02:38:06.900 --> 02:38:08.560]  You know, I'm not, I'm not really following you.
[02:38:08.580 --> 02:38:10.921]  Can you, uh, just, just exactly what are you saying, sir?
[02:38:12.601 --> 02:38:15.302]  Um, well, the end, my friend.
[02:38:15.982 --> 02:38:16.562]  What do they do?
[02:38:17.002 --> 02:38:19.542]  They inject you with heroin in Paris, France.
[02:38:19.602 --> 02:38:20.743]  You know what I'm talking about.
[02:38:21.203 --> 02:38:23.583]  You're talking about, uh, Jim Morrison.
[02:38:23.943 --> 02:38:24.603]  Exactly.
[02:38:25.044 --> 02:38:26.564]  I knew you would fill in the blanks.
[02:38:27.264 --> 02:38:30.425]  Oh, this is the end, my friend, of our elaborate plans?
[02:38:31.345 --> 02:38:32.425]  Is not, not the end?
[02:38:34.011 --> 02:38:34.571]  I hear you, man.
[02:38:34.591 --> 02:38:35.512]  I appreciate your call.
[02:38:36.193 --> 02:38:37.534]  Let's talk to Richard in Texas.
[02:38:37.574 --> 02:38:38.395]  Richard, go ahead.
[02:38:40.076 --> 02:38:41.097]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:38:41.377 --> 02:38:41.758]  Hello.
[02:38:43.319 --> 02:38:43.920]  Great show.
[02:38:44.740 --> 02:38:49.505]  I really wanted to talk to David Van Oss, but it sort of got long.
[02:38:50.806 --> 02:38:52.507]  It's legal stuff I wanted to talk about.
[02:38:52.547 --> 02:38:53.668]  I thought you did a great job.
[02:38:56.397 --> 02:38:58.938]  Questioning former Attorney General Ashcroft.
[02:38:58.958 --> 02:39:07.763]  You know, in retrospect, I think that Ashcroft and Colin Powell were two of the better people over there in the administration.
[02:39:07.783 --> 02:39:13.346]  I mean, as bad as they were, they didn't write memos saying they could torture children.
[02:39:13.926 --> 02:39:14.426]  Exactly.
[02:39:14.446 --> 02:39:16.107]  Those were the good guys.
[02:39:16.687 --> 02:39:21.910]  And they might have actually been able to give a straight answer other than, you know,
[02:39:22.631 --> 02:39:23.412]  Other than just laughing?
[02:39:23.432 --> 02:39:29.057]  Well, I wouldn't call them good guys, but, you know, I mean, a demon next to Beelzebub looks pretty good.
[02:39:29.657 --> 02:39:44.711]  You know, one thing that I've always wanted to ask those guys is, is who... Why have there been no grand jury indictments of the people that the government says committed the 9-11 attack?
[02:39:44.731 --> 02:39:49.635]  Oh, yeah, that's... I wanted to ask you one more thing, and that is, who should be indicted?
[02:39:50.680 --> 02:39:52.460]  For the 9-11 attacks in particular.
[02:39:52.520 --> 02:39:53.520]  Anybody in particular?
[02:39:54.021 --> 02:39:54.861]  Yeah, Dick Cheney.
[02:39:55.601 --> 02:39:55.681]  Ah.
[02:39:56.041 --> 02:39:57.681]  Definitely in control of NORAD.
[02:39:57.781 --> 02:39:59.121]  Definitely ordered to stand down.
[02:40:00.522 --> 02:40:02.382]  That's the prima facie evidence?
[02:40:02.782 --> 02:40:03.742]  To stand down for NORAD?
[02:40:04.482 --> 02:40:05.122]  Oh yeah.
[02:40:05.382 --> 02:40:06.843]  Norman Mineta's testimony.
[02:40:08.263 --> 02:40:10.863]  The people involved in the CIA and insider trading.
[02:40:10.883 --> 02:40:13.084]  You know, we can start on things like that.
[02:40:14.284 --> 02:40:17.865]  Connalisa Rice under oath before the Senate Intelligence Committee.
[02:40:18.065 --> 02:40:19.845]  Swore that she'd never seen any plans.
[02:40:20.345 --> 02:40:21.306]  Who has jurisdiction?
[02:40:21.366 --> 02:40:23.007]  Any state or federal grand jury could do it.
[02:40:23.067 --> 02:40:23.687]  Even one in Texas?
[02:40:48.926 --> 02:40:51.530]  Uh, yeah, because those crimes affected people in Texas.
[02:40:51.550 --> 02:40:52.631]  People from Texas died.
[02:40:52.731 --> 02:40:52.911]  U.S.
[02:40:52.931 --> 02:40:53.572]  citizens died.
[02:40:53.993 --> 02:40:54.153]  Yeah.
[02:40:54.173 --> 02:40:54.353]  Huh.
[02:40:55.875 --> 02:40:57.357]  Interesting what badass would say.
[02:40:58.158 --> 02:40:58.919]  Thank you so much.
[02:40:58.959 --> 02:40:59.981]  I appreciate your call.
[02:41:00.581 --> 02:41:03.045]  Yeah, and by the way, we did look into that, uh...
[02:41:04.227 --> 02:41:09.832]  Constitution clause yesterday and the list unfortunately was incorrect.
[02:41:10.572 --> 02:41:16.837]  If the President has said he opposes a law in 10 days with Congress adjourned, it is a pocket veto.
[02:41:17.178 --> 02:41:28.367]  But the President said he supported the legislation, so the law, while fraudulent in its constitutionality, is not fraudulent in the Congressional procedure.
[02:41:29.289 --> 02:41:31.772]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:41:32.233 --> 02:41:33.774]  Rick and Reno, welcome sir.
[02:41:34.035 --> 02:41:34.835]  Hello Mr. Jones.
[02:41:35.256 --> 02:41:41.063]  Something I've always wanted to do, and now that my kids are grown and gone, I can.
[02:41:41.083 --> 02:41:44.006]  And that's right across the country on my motorcycle.
[02:41:44.066 --> 02:41:48.992]  And I'm wondering, is that going to be possible once this wonderful superhighway is built?
[02:41:50.547 --> 02:42:07.711]  Yes, if you've got the Statesman reported from the TechStop documents with the Spanish company that a drive from Austin to Dallas and back at the average peak times, because it can be more or less, I think it was $260 something dollars.
[02:42:08.351 --> 02:42:19.613]  I know per gallon, they were announcing $385 per gallon on average, that's what it breaks down to an average miles per travel via the transponder, but then the new TechStop documents look like it's going to be even more.
[02:42:20.560 --> 02:42:33.283]  See, what I'm wondering, though, is when this NAFTA superhighway is built from south to north, connecting Mexico and Canada, I'm wondering if I'm going to be able to go from west coast to east coast.
[02:42:33.303 --> 02:42:34.844]  Well, let's be clear, sir.
[02:42:34.904 --> 02:42:42.146]  The official SPP.gov website, the official Texas and other states that have the documents that we've been able to get at the state level,
[02:42:43.019 --> 02:42:51.729]  Everybody hears about the highway from southern Mexico on its west coast up into central Canada.
[02:42:52.169 --> 02:42:53.290]  Everybody hears about that.
[02:42:53.631 --> 02:42:59.197]  There are 82 other federal highways that are not building new ones.
[02:42:59.856 --> 02:43:02.200]  This is just a major arterial they're going to build in the middle.
[02:43:02.641 --> 02:43:08.810]  All the major highways, and then the state highways are rolled in under state agreements with the internationalists, are rolled into this.
[02:43:08.850 --> 02:43:11.734]  So it's basically every major road in the country.
[02:43:12.115 --> 02:43:12.616]  Officially!
[02:43:13.614 --> 02:43:22.897]  I've suspected, though, that they're trying to partition the country into two parts and you won't be able to cross unless you have special papers and unless you're, you know, the right kind of... Well, you're right.
[02:43:23.017 --> 02:43:24.838]  I-35 could be used as an artificial wall.
[02:43:25.158 --> 02:43:27.518]  It will have concrete abutments where you cannot exit.
[02:43:27.538 --> 02:43:30.919]  They're going to build the stores and shops and gas stations in the middle.
[02:43:31.320 --> 02:43:41.663]  You see this already in other toll road areas of the country, but I'm just going off what they're doing, and it does mesh with Agenda 21 and 90% of the country being off-limits to humans.
[02:43:41.683 --> 02:43:42.283]  Thanks for the call.
[02:43:42.763 --> 02:43:46.764]  Yeah, yeah, it is serfdom, it is feudalism, but why go off of what you suspect?
[02:43:46.884 --> 02:43:53.426]  That they admit they're going to control the mobility, and they're going to do it financially, and track everything you're doing.
[02:43:53.486 --> 02:43:54.347]  Oh, it's so free.
[02:43:54.407 --> 02:43:56.367]  Land of the Surveilled, Home of the Slave.
[02:43:56.867 --> 02:44:01.389]  Let's talk to Nigel in Canada.
[02:44:01.449 --> 02:44:02.209]  Go ahead, Nigel.
[02:44:02.649 --> 02:44:03.209]  Hi, Alex.
[02:44:03.249 --> 02:44:04.170]  How are you?
[02:44:04.290 --> 02:44:04.870]  I'm fine, sir.
[02:44:05.210 --> 02:44:08.131]  It's awesome to talk to you all the way down in Texas there.
[02:44:09.011 --> 02:44:11.592]  Yeah, I just wanted to say about the Bible punchers.
[02:44:12.005 --> 02:44:21.087]  Can you imagine if we'd all said, you know, Jesus promoted peace, which he did, but if we all laid down to Hitler and just, you know, said... I mean, he would have just laughed at us.
[02:44:22.067 --> 02:44:26.868]  Well, I mean, what about laying down to... I mean, they would actually... this doctrine isn't new.
[02:44:26.908 --> 02:44:30.489]  They would tell blacks laid down, it's your lot to be slaves.
[02:44:30.989 --> 02:44:33.830]  I mean, these are doctrines of devils.
[02:44:34.690 --> 02:44:35.670]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:44:35.730 --> 02:44:37.971]  And also, I think you're great.
[02:44:38.789 --> 02:44:40.491]  You've got a really great personality.
[02:44:40.571 --> 02:44:45.997]  I don't know how you keep doing this, but I hope you keep doing it.
[02:44:46.017 --> 02:44:48.960]  Have you ever thought about getting into movies or anything?
[02:44:49.641 --> 02:44:52.704]  I know you make movies, but mainstream television?
[02:44:53.411 --> 02:44:56.013]  I haven't really been working on that too much.
[02:44:56.133 --> 02:44:57.354]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:44:58.215 --> 02:44:58.555]  You bet.
[02:44:59.656 --> 02:45:00.717]  Yeah, I'm in two movies.
[02:45:00.777 --> 02:45:04.140]  I'm in Waking Life and The Scanner Darkly, and I never requested to be in those.
[02:45:04.560 --> 02:45:07.122]  Rick Linklater is a great American and a fan of the broadcast.
[02:45:07.143 --> 02:45:07.843]  I was here in Austin.
[02:45:07.863 --> 02:45:09.945]  I'm friends with him, and he put me in two movies.
[02:45:10.643 --> 02:45:15.005]  And then I have a friend who is... I'm not going to get into it.
[02:45:16.065 --> 02:45:18.266]  Yeah, we're all here in a couple years.
[02:45:18.326 --> 02:45:22.428]  You won't just see me in little one minute or two minute roles in movies if I have time.
[02:45:22.448 --> 02:45:24.869]  I mean, I like science fiction.
[02:45:24.909 --> 02:45:26.290]  I like dystopic films.
[02:45:27.010 --> 02:45:27.770]  I mean, I would not.
[02:45:27.810 --> 02:45:34.473]  I mean, if they called me tomorrow and said, we want you to play a cop in a big movie, and it was just some boring cop role, I would say no.
[02:45:35.265 --> 02:45:35.525]  I would.
[02:45:35.565 --> 02:45:36.886]  I'm not in love with it.
[02:45:36.926 --> 02:45:38.568]  I'm not totally enamored with it.
[02:45:39.028 --> 02:45:40.589]  Though I do like filmmaking and acting.
[02:45:41.670 --> 02:45:46.874]  But, yeah, I am actually going to pursue film.
[02:45:47.854 --> 02:45:51.197]  But I got to, at least, it's just going to get worse and worse.
[02:45:51.217 --> 02:45:52.058]  So, no, I'm not going to.
[02:45:52.098 --> 02:45:52.778]  I would like to.
[02:45:53.559 --> 02:45:58.462]  And if roles fall in my lap, if the phone rings, and it's something that won't take up my time.
[02:45:58.502 --> 02:46:01.525]  I mean, I may be doing a radio show from a set trailer or something.
[02:46:03.690 --> 02:46:05.812]  Alex Jones, Space Captain.
[02:46:06.173 --> 02:46:07.474]  All right, okay, that's funny.
[02:46:08.054 --> 02:46:08.535]  That's real.
[02:46:08.615 --> 02:46:13.860]  And by the way, listen, I can tell by your voice, you know that you wanted me to talk about it for some reason.
[02:46:14.300 --> 02:46:17.643]  You're the guy that called in and claimed you were pro-New World Order a few weeks ago as a big joke.
[02:46:18.044 --> 02:46:25.451]  So it's all part of some type of a plum that you reinforce by imagining that you direct me and punch my buttons.
[02:46:26.252 --> 02:46:28.574]  I don't know how, but actually, sir, I see right through you.
[02:46:29.295 --> 02:46:31.457]  Let's go ahead, but I'll give you what you want regardless.
[02:46:31.817 --> 02:46:35.600]  I never really talk about how I am in a couple of films, so I might as well talk about it.
[02:46:35.620 --> 02:46:36.541]  It's kind of interesting, I guess.
[02:46:37.222 --> 02:46:42.086]  Let's go ahead and talk to David in Wisconsin.
[02:46:42.106 --> 02:46:42.546]  Go ahead.
[02:46:43.447 --> 02:46:47.610]  Alex, this is just for that wimpy Christian that called in.
[02:46:48.311 --> 02:46:53.415]  What about the whole armor of God, including the sword of the spirit that you're supposed to attack with?
[02:46:54.571 --> 02:46:56.352]  Fight against all the devices of the devil.
[02:46:56.913 --> 02:46:58.995]  Plus, people complicate this thing.
[02:46:59.175 --> 02:47:01.817]  It's Lucifer or God, and what side you on.
[02:47:01.837 --> 02:47:08.222]  That's right, and Christ said over and over again, you were hot nor cold, I spit you out of my mouth.
[02:47:08.362 --> 02:47:13.826]  God hates people that will not put themselves in the way of the fist.
[02:47:14.086 --> 02:47:17.489]  God hates people that won't stand in the gap when the enemy comes in like a flood.
[02:47:17.829 --> 02:47:19.951]  God hates cowards!
[02:47:21.443 --> 02:47:31.089]  I sit up here in Wisconsin, I listen to the Christian radio stations, and they're all like, well we gotta fight evil, gotta fight evil, and then, ooh, let's vote Bush in, let's vote the Republicans in.
[02:47:31.129 --> 02:47:35.272]  Yeah, it's not evil by nuking Iran, it is, they're bought off cults.
[02:47:35.732 --> 02:47:38.874]  Well, but, they're just following like sheep.
[02:47:38.954 --> 02:47:46.639]  We need to have men with some gonads standing up, and some women, and start being real Christians in this country, and take back our country.
[02:47:46.699 --> 02:47:49.461]  Thank you Alex, and 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:47:50.573 --> 02:47:51.194]  Absolutely.
[02:47:51.234 --> 02:47:52.755]  By the way, I haven't plugged this all day.
[02:47:53.136 --> 02:47:55.798]  We rose to 37 on Google Video yesterday.
[02:47:55.818 --> 02:47:55.798]  37!
[02:47:57.520 --> 02:47:59.762]  And we plunged back to 50-something today.
[02:48:00.222 --> 02:48:02.004]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:48:02.124 --> 02:48:02.965]  That's the link.
[02:48:03.966 --> 02:48:05.187]  Send that link to everybody.
[02:48:05.207 --> 02:48:10.092]  Do a high-quality, high-res version of TerrorStorm this weekend where people have time to watch it.
[02:48:10.292 --> 02:48:11.633]  Email your whole email list.
[02:48:11.673 --> 02:48:13.335]  Go crazy calling every talk show.
[02:48:13.735 --> 02:48:15.457]  Help send TerrorStorm to number one.
[02:48:22.060 --> 02:48:25.261]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:25.621 --> 02:48:27.541]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:27.901 --> 02:48:35.563]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:48:36.243 --> 02:48:43.284]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:48:43.685 --> 02:48:50.546]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:48:51.061 --> 02:48:55.104]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:48:55.425 --> 02:48:58.947]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:48:59.388 --> 02:49:01.329]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:01.650 --> 02:49:05.573]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:15.607 --> 02:50:16.228]  I think so.
[02:50:37.588 --> 02:50:38.188]  I think so.
[02:50:53.493 --> 02:50:53.973]  I think so.
[02:51:23.732 --> 02:51:25.633]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:51:26.113 --> 02:51:28.914]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:30.375 --> 02:51:32.236]  Four program notes.
[02:51:32.816 --> 02:51:34.517]  Help us promote Terror Storm.
[02:51:34.537 --> 02:51:35.817]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:51:35.897 --> 02:51:36.777]  That's the version.
[02:51:36.817 --> 02:51:37.458]  That's the link.
[02:51:37.738 --> 02:51:39.759]  The high-res one that's in the top 100 of Google.
[02:51:40.099 --> 02:51:40.919]  Went up to 30-something.
[02:51:40.939 --> 02:51:41.980]  Dropped down to 50 again.
[02:51:42.020 --> 02:51:42.400]  Help us.
[02:51:42.800 --> 02:51:44.861]  I'll see you this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:51:44.921 --> 02:51:45.381]  Central.
[02:51:45.721 --> 02:51:46.782]  That's 2 to 4 p.m.
[02:51:46.882 --> 02:51:47.422]  Pacific.
[02:51:47.922 --> 02:51:49.564]  I guess that's 5 to 7 Eastern.
[02:51:49.584 --> 02:51:54.449]  You can listen via Infowars.com or there at the GCN Radio website.
[02:51:54.689 --> 02:51:55.990]  We'll have links up on the sites.
[02:51:56.430 --> 02:51:58.352]  I do that Sunday show now that we have syndicated.
[02:51:58.392 --> 02:52:00.014]  We've got new affiliates signing on to that.
[02:52:00.034 --> 02:52:07.141]  I want to thank all the stations that have and ask others that haven't to either pick it up live from 4 to 6 or rebroadcast it later on Sunday evenings.
[02:52:08.590 --> 02:52:18.992]  And I will be at the Waterloo Records, big huge record and video store on October 31st in about a week and a half from 5 to 6 30 p.m.
[02:52:19.012 --> 02:52:21.252]  giving a speech and signing Terror Storm.
[02:52:21.312 --> 02:52:23.473]  It's being launched in stores nationwide.
[02:52:23.913 --> 02:52:31.214]  On that date, Barnes & Noble and other places, please go out and buy them up so more get stocked and so more people have a chance to see the truth on store shelves.
[02:52:31.634 --> 02:52:34.355]  And yes, if you believe in what we're doing, please support us.

[02:52:44.440 --> 02:52:46.621]  I'm carrying the new Controlled Demolitions video.
[02:52:46.641 --> 02:52:48.923]  9-11 Mysteries Demolitions.
[02:52:49.443 --> 02:52:50.544]  My new film Terror Storm.
[02:52:50.604 --> 02:52:51.764]  Again, InfoWars.com.
[02:52:51.804 --> 02:52:53.205]  It's available right now.

[02:53:01.630 --> 02:53:04.152]  Let us go now to Matt in Tennessee.
[02:53:04.212 --> 02:53:04.712]  Matt, go ahead.
[02:53:05.666 --> 02:53:07.007]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[02:53:07.027 --> 02:53:12.650]  I heard in the last half hour you put out the call about the verse about rising up against the evildoers.
[02:53:12.690 --> 02:53:15.612]  Here it is right here, Psalm 94, 15 through 17.
[02:53:16.192 --> 02:53:20.875]  But judgment shall return unto righteousness, and all the upright in heart shall follow it.
[02:53:21.455 --> 02:53:23.716]  Who will rise up for me against the evildoers?
[02:53:23.776 --> 02:53:26.358]  Or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?
[02:53:26.758 --> 02:53:32.141]  Unless the Lord had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence.
[02:53:34.930 --> 02:53:38.111]  I mean, how can anybody read the Bible and say we're not supposed to fight evil?
[02:53:39.592 --> 02:53:45.074]  I don't know, because it says right there, your soul dwells in silence if the Lord doesn't help you.
[02:53:45.414 --> 02:53:48.495]  Right after that, who will rise up against the evildoers?
[02:53:48.715 --> 02:53:49.596]  It says it right there.
[02:53:49.976 --> 02:54:03.461]  And additionally, Romans 13, people need to keep in mind that only a government that is a terror to the evil is a government that you submit to because that government
[02:54:03.962 --> 02:54:06.585]  Is a government subject unto the higher powers.
[02:54:06.685 --> 02:54:19.838]  When such government ceases to be a terror to the evil, it is a government that you are not bound by law, metaphysical God's law, to submit to.
[02:54:20.098 --> 02:54:20.499]  I hear you.
[02:54:20.539 --> 02:54:22.020]  Thanks for the call.
[02:54:22.080 --> 02:54:23.121]  I said I'd mention this.
[02:54:24.002 --> 02:54:25.984]  He's gone public, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:26.825 --> 02:54:27.886]  It's really exciting.
[02:54:28.867 --> 02:54:40.054]  The founder of the Marine Corps Intelligence Command and former high-level CIA officer has gone public, Robert Steele, saying he believes that it was an inside job.
[02:54:40.074 --> 02:54:45.237]  I'm going to get Robert Steele on the show doing an article about that later today.
[02:54:45.277 --> 02:54:50.299]  And they're now admitting that the Canadian, the young kids, were supposed to be planning bombings five months ago.
[02:54:50.680 --> 02:54:52.220]  As we told you, it was all provocatory.
[02:54:52.261 --> 02:54:53.301]  That's mainstream news now.
[02:54:53.701 --> 02:54:54.722]  And that's up on the websites.
[02:54:55.082 --> 02:54:57.463]  Last caller, let's talk to Frank in New Jersey.
[02:54:57.503 --> 02:54:58.184]  Frank, welcome.
[02:54:58.744 --> 02:55:00.665]  Yes, thank you so much, Alex.
[02:55:01.386 --> 02:55:06.549]  You might try 9710 also, Ye that love the Lord hate evil.
[02:55:06.889 --> 02:55:17.154]  And then it goes on in Proverbs 29, 12, If a ruler hearkens to lies, all his servants are wicked.
[02:55:17.455 --> 02:55:17.775]  Alright?
[02:55:17.995 --> 02:55:24.098]  But also you might check StopNorthAmericanUnion.com for all the documentation you need.
[02:55:24.158 --> 02:55:25.159]  I got it through Joyce and
[02:55:25.689 --> 02:55:31.812]  And Dave, and also, one of the best websites out there for stuff, libertygunright.com.
[02:55:31.852 --> 02:55:38.174]  And every video you've done since 9-11, I get to my police chief and everyone else of any significance.
[02:55:38.294 --> 02:55:39.195]  Is it waking them up?
[02:55:40.215 --> 02:55:41.756]  Listen, I, yes it is.
[02:55:42.196 --> 02:55:42.856]  Believe me, it is.
[02:55:42.876 --> 02:55:43.276]  Keep it up.
[02:55:43.316 --> 02:55:44.417]  Let's expose the terrorists.
[02:55:44.437 --> 02:55:45.077]  God bless you.
[02:55:45.457 --> 02:55:47.198]  And again, I'm asking you for help.
[02:55:47.808 --> 02:55:49.289]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:55:49.329 --> 02:55:50.670]  Go to InfoWars.com.

[02:55:53.152 --> 02:55:54.193]  Give it to everybody!
[02:55:54.293 --> 02:55:55.474]  Attack the enemy!
[02:55:55.534 --> 02:55:56.194]  God bless!
[02:55:59.136 --> 02:56:03.039]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
