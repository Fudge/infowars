[00:00:06.063 --> 00:00:06.703]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.364 --> 00:00:08.424]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.125 --> 00:00:10.245]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.885 --> 00:00:11.706]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:13.367]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.027 --> 00:00:17.849]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.209 --> 00:00:22.292]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.779 --> 00:00:35.380]  We're good to go.
[00:00:41.605 --> 00:00:43.087]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:43.467 --> 00:00:45.630]  It is Thursday, the second day of March 2006.
[00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.894]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:49.914 --> 00:00:53.438]  We're going to have wide open phones on any news topic, any issue, any item.
[00:00:53.858 --> 00:00:56.581]  You disagree with me, you agree with me, you have a question, a comment, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:00:56.621 --> 00:00:59.524]  Ron Paul will be showing up sometime in the third hour.
[00:00:59.544 --> 00:01:00.465]  He is scheduled today.
[00:01:04.944 --> 00:01:12.570]  But he's busy with a lot of different issues they're dealing with on Capitol Hill, so it'll be sometime in the third hour that is scheduled.
[00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:26.260]  He joins us about every month and a half or so on the broadcast over the last 10 plus years, and it's always very, very informative as he gives us a legislative update and gives us a lot of internal information.
[00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.302]  I'll also bring it up to the congressman about
[00:01:29.975 --> 00:01:40.963]  Patriot Act reauthorization, really Patriot Act 2, set to be signed by the President here very, very soon, leaving Congress now, clearing one of its final hurdles.
[00:01:41.123 --> 00:01:44.285]  So that will come up with Congressman Ron Paul as well.
[00:01:45.786 --> 00:01:52.591]  Here's an article that is out of the Washington Post.
[00:01:52.811 --> 00:01:55.133]  Morgues pressed to stay quiet...
[00:01:56.005 --> 00:02:09.830]  Officials overseeing Baghdad's morgue have come under pressure not to investigate the soaring number of apparent cases of executions and torture in the country, the former human rights chief for Iraq said yesterday.
[00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:18.833]  Actually, he said a week and a half ago to major foreign publications that 1,000 people a month are being tortured to death.
[00:02:18.893 --> 00:02:23.295]  That's official, but that has now been filtered out by the Washington Post.
[00:02:24.057 --> 00:02:28.619]  And by the time they're done with it, they have watered it down substantively.
[00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:29.700]  So we'll get into that.
[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.723]  Alberto Gonzalez, the Attorney General who says the President is above the law, hints at wider surveillance program.
[00:02:36.763 --> 00:02:37.944]  This is too out of the Washington Post.
[00:02:37.964 --> 00:02:39.284]  We don't need him to hint at it.
[00:02:39.584 --> 00:02:42.006]  See, they bring out a little bit, a little bit more, a little bit more.
[00:02:42.806 --> 00:02:44.867]  We already know it's massive, it's total.
[00:02:45.207 --> 00:02:47.168]  It's called the Total Information Awareness Network.
[00:02:47.568 --> 00:02:49.009]  Just one NSA program.
[00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:54.934]  Also, lawmakers still angered but growing resigned over the ports deal.
[00:02:54.954 --> 00:03:02.903]  They've been told to sit down and shut up because the ports are nothing compared to the rest of our infrastructure.
[00:03:02.963 --> 00:03:04.905]  America is more owned by foreigners.
[00:03:05.658 --> 00:03:11.482]  Water districts, power companies, roads than it is even by the government or the American people.
[00:03:11.522 --> 00:03:13.984]  And no other country in the world does this.
[00:03:14.424 --> 00:03:15.365]  We are schmucks.
[00:03:15.465 --> 00:03:16.406]  We are sold out.
[00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:18.047]  It's a big, sick joke.
[00:03:18.087 --> 00:03:20.249]  The foreign lobbyists came in here decades ago.
[00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:21.850]  They bought off our government.
[00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.693]  They're turning us into a police state to make sure we don't struggle while they rake the daylights out of us.
[00:03:27.074 --> 00:03:28.234]  Have you figured that out yet?
[00:03:28.254 --> 00:03:28.935]  We'll get into it.
[00:03:29.435 --> 00:03:33.117]  Millions given to Tsunami staying with the United Nations.
[00:03:33.417 --> 00:03:34.858]  They're just stealing the money, as usual.
[00:03:34.878 --> 00:03:35.438]  We'll get into that.
[00:03:35.838 --> 00:03:38.039]  Oh, by the way, on the Port Hill, Bill Clinton's helping out with it.
[00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:43.802]  More on the big poll about how more Americans know about the Simpson characters than the First Amendment.
[00:03:44.142 --> 00:03:49.144]  Only one in a thousand Americans could even partially quote the First Amendment.
[00:03:49.224 --> 00:03:52.786]  And we'll get into an amazing article by Paul Watson.
[00:03:53.638 --> 00:04:01.089]  Former Soviet dissident warns of EU socialist dictatorship and, as usual, involved with the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation.
[00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.956]  Pentagon develops brain implants to turn sharks into military spies.
[00:04:05.996 --> 00:04:07.258]  This out of a London Independent.
[00:04:08.402 --> 00:04:10.163]  No, we're not talking about the Sci-Fi Channel.
[00:04:10.183 --> 00:04:11.283]  We're talking about the real world.
[00:04:11.703 --> 00:04:12.403]  India-U.S.
[00:04:12.443 --> 00:04:14.564]  agree on historic nuclear pact.
[00:04:14.584 --> 00:04:15.244]  We'll get into that.
[00:04:15.704 --> 00:04:19.906]  Soft drinks found to have high levels of cancer chemical in them.
[00:04:19.986 --> 00:04:23.747]  Eight times safe level what's allowed in water of benzene.
[00:04:24.707 --> 00:04:25.288]  Very deadly.
[00:04:25.828 --> 00:04:31.590]  Study shows decline of neurological problem disorders after removal of thimerosal containing vaccines.
[00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.650]  I don't buy that for a minute.
[00:04:34.091 --> 00:04:35.612]  Bird flu likely in U.S.
[00:04:35.732 --> 00:04:36.553]  flocks soon.
[00:04:37.133 --> 00:04:41.176]  Health Secretary is saying fine gold reads Constitution on Senate floor.
[00:04:43.098 --> 00:04:44.759]  Soviet Union ordered Pope shooting.
[00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:46.080]  Italy Commission reports.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.221]  Teacher caught in Bush rant.
[00:04:48.762 --> 00:04:49.703]  Now been suspended.
[00:04:50.323 --> 00:04:51.384]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:51.564 --> 00:04:55.587]  Ultra-massive broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:04:55.647 --> 00:04:56.928]  The news blitz is coming.
[00:04:57.288 --> 00:04:58.349]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:00.090]  InfoWars.com, PrismBotter.com.
[00:05:02.853 --> 00:05:05.715]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.975 --> 00:05:06.676]  Hello, my friends.
[00:05:06.756 --> 00:05:07.536]  Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.896 --> 00:05:12.559]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:19.644]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.964 --> 00:05:21.946]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:22.146 --> 00:05:24.988]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:29.753]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.953 --> 00:05:34.357]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.597 --> 00:05:41.823]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:42.083 --> 00:05:44.505]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:05:44.665 --> 00:05:46.387]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[00:05:46.527 --> 00:05:49.868]  1-888-253-3139 Or visit InfoWars.com and the secure shopping cart.
[00:05:49.908 --> 00:05:54.510]  That's InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139 Or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:02.745 --> 00:06:11.810]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:23.297]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:06:23.637 --> 00:06:29.340]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:30.261]  We're good to go.
[00:06:54.017 --> 00:06:54.197]  803-4438.
[00:06:54.217 --> 00:06:56.499]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.903]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:07:01.304 --> 00:07:02.405]  You don't love me anymore?
[00:07:02.725 --> 00:07:04.547]  You used to take such good care of me.
[00:07:04.567 --> 00:07:06.048]  Is that my car talking to me?
[00:07:06.168 --> 00:07:06.469]  Yes.
[00:07:06.769 --> 00:07:07.590]  You neglect me.
[00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.752]  Change my oil late most of the time.
[00:07:11.593 --> 00:07:12.594]  Use the cheapest gas.
[00:07:12.935 --> 00:07:13.795]  I'm getting sick.
[00:07:14.136 --> 00:07:16.298]  One of these days, I'm just gonna give up.
[00:07:17.338 --> 00:07:17.819]  Wait a minute.
[00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:19.519]  I've got three more years of payments on you.
[00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:28.344]  If you want me to last forever, you need to add protected engine treatment, protected transmission treatment, and especially protected complete fuel system treatment.
[00:07:28.784 --> 00:07:34.267]  Protected unique synthetic fortifiers treat the metal and the oil to reduce friction like no other.
[00:07:34.487 --> 00:07:36.888]  Okay, I'll add some protecta, but you'll have to perform.
[00:07:37.028 --> 00:07:41.691]  How about faster acceleration, more horsepower, longer lasting?
[00:07:41.931 --> 00:07:43.573]  I'll always be there for you.
[00:07:43.753 --> 00:07:47.095]  So if you want more, treat it right with Protecta by SFR.

[00:08:01.305 --> 00:08:04.407]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents...
[00:08:04.887 --> 00:08:06.307]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.687 --> 00:08:08.848]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:30.244 --> 00:08:30.665]  Welcome.
[00:08:30.685 --> 00:08:36.181]  We're now eight minutes into this live Thursday edition, second day of March 2006.
[00:08:37.882 --> 00:08:39.644]  Second segment for stations that just joined us.
[00:08:39.684 --> 00:08:41.505]  We have open phones today, toll free.
[00:08:42.226 --> 00:08:47.310]  Number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:59.320]  Before I get into big new port developments and Iran developments and police state activities and the Patriot Act expansion almost sure to pass, Ron Paul is scheduled the third hour today.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.542]  Congressman Ron Paul, best congressman we've got.
[00:09:01.582 --> 00:09:06.486]  Before I get into all that, so I don't forget and not cover this, let's just do it right now.
[00:09:07.066 --> 00:09:10.730]  Two articles by Paul Watson, who is a man on fire.
[00:09:11.571 --> 00:09:26.646]  Paul is working, I can report to you, 18 hours a day without being pushed and prodded because he knows the time is short, he knows the enemy is coming, he understands how serious things are, and he is now working as hard as I am, and I commend him.
[00:09:27.226 --> 00:09:27.707]  We're good to go.
[00:09:27.747 --> 00:09:27.947]  I think?
[00:09:47.738 --> 00:09:50.420]  But Paul is updating the site three times a day.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.262]  He's writing on average three articles a day now.
[00:09:54.643 --> 00:09:55.724]  And he's conferring with me.
[00:09:55.764 --> 00:09:57.765]  We're collaborating, writing articles together.
[00:09:58.146 --> 00:10:02.809]  I've just got to commend Paul Joseph Watson right now because he's on fire.
[00:10:03.409 --> 00:10:07.012]  Let me just read this little article he wrote about the Simpsons situation.
[00:10:08.293 --> 00:10:16.799]  Why Americans know more about the Simpsons than the Constitution and why it is a benchmark of how much danger we are in.
[00:10:17.834 --> 00:10:25.557]  Most Americans can name Simpson's characters than they can the freedoms that the First Amendment upholds.
[00:10:25.817 --> 00:10:31.520]  Again, more Americans can name Simpson characters than they can the freedoms that the First Amendment upholds.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:39.163]  This is a benchmark of how much danger the country is in, and the blame can be laid with public education.
[00:10:40.004 --> 00:10:46.170]  Only one in a thousand Americans can name all five First Amendment freedoms, the BBC reports.
[00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:52.075]  The names of American Idol TV show judges and popular advertising slogans...
[00:10:53.368 --> 00:11:03.850]  Also proved more memorable than the five freedoms, speech, religion, press, assembly, and petition for a redress of grievances.
[00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:04.591]  There's really six.
[00:11:04.631 --> 00:11:05.471]  The press says five.
[00:11:05.491 --> 00:11:06.411]  They misinterpret that.
[00:11:06.691 --> 00:11:12.633]  There's two separate rights of religion to establish and to exercise.
[00:11:14.313 --> 00:11:14.573]  Oh, boy.
[00:11:16.596 --> 00:11:21.165]  But continuing, this kind of poll gives aid and comfort to the enemy.
[00:11:21.305 --> 00:11:28.158]  The globalists read this kind of thing and it only enhances their myopic zeal to dominate and enslave us for...
[00:11:29.418 --> 00:11:30.559]  Our own good, of course.
[00:11:30.839 --> 00:11:40.128]  They have brainwashed themselves using Straussian theology to believe that they have a divine right to subjugate and rule stupid people for the good of the planet.
[00:11:40.208 --> 00:11:47.354]  I partially disagree with that, because we have documents we're going to read here in a moment where they admit that we were too smart 100 years ago and had to be dumbed down.
[00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:50.096]  I've read the National Banking Association documents from 1898.
[00:11:50.436 --> 00:11:53.378]  They're in published major books.
[00:11:53.398 --> 00:11:54.459]  They've been in major newspapers.
[00:11:54.479 --> 00:11:57.882]  They didn't even hide it, saying Americans are too smart, too informed.
[00:11:57.902 --> 00:11:59.783]  The average American can speak Latin.
[00:12:00.404 --> 00:12:02.785]  The highest test scores in the world.
[00:12:02.825 --> 00:12:03.146]  They're just...
[00:12:03.946 --> 00:12:04.787]  We're good to go.
[00:12:04.807 --> 00:12:05.047]  I think?
[00:12:24.747 --> 00:12:28.653]  From the very foundation of the public school system, the elite made their plans clear.
[00:12:28.713 --> 00:12:35.684]  The goal was to psychologically mold people to create mindless drones and bricks in the wall of the system via learning
[00:12:36.937 --> 00:12:42.158]  Monotonously by rote, and the day being divided up into Pavlovian bells.
[00:12:42.758 --> 00:12:44.298]  Ding the bell in one-hour periods.
[00:12:44.338 --> 00:12:47.179]  That was Russian psychological warfare training with dogs.
[00:12:47.679 --> 00:13:00.461]  And then the Germans picked up on it with kindergarten, and that whole model was the Prussians came up with it to train young men to charge machine gun naps to totally just blot out any critical thinking or individualism.
[00:13:00.661 --> 00:13:03.242]  That's just in the encyclopedia, by the way, about kindergarten.
[00:13:03.262 --> 00:13:03.862]  You didn't know that?
[00:13:05.375 --> 00:13:28.480]  In 1905, a dissertation for Columbia Teachers College, Elwood Cumberley, the future dean of education at Stanford, wrote the schools should be factories in which raw products, this is a quote, children are to be shaped and formed into finished products manufactured like nails, and the specifications for manufacturing will come from government and industry.
[00:13:29.873 --> 00:13:34.838]  And big industry doesn't want competition, so they want to annihilate a middle class, and that's stated.
[00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:50.835]  Similarly, the Rockefeller Education Board, which funded the creation of numerous public schools, issued a statement which read in part, and in my first film, America Destroyed by Design, I go show a model UN brainwashing session at UT with high school juniors and seniors.
[00:13:51.681 --> 00:14:00.011]  And I've been researching at the UT Library and had read quotes by the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation saying this, and guess what?
[00:14:00.031 --> 00:14:08.481]  I went and pulled the actual report by the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation and actually read it from their own report.
[00:14:08.962 --> 00:14:11.125]  When I read this ten years ago,
[00:14:11.965 --> 00:14:13.366]  I did not believe it.
[00:14:13.766 --> 00:14:16.828]  And back in the day, you couldn't find this stuff on the web.
[00:14:17.348 --> 00:14:19.369]  Every week I was down there for hours at UT.
[00:14:19.669 --> 00:14:22.771]  And every time I read a quote somewhere or saw it in a newsletter, I said, that's not true.
[00:14:23.051 --> 00:14:25.032]  And I'd go down, and every time.
[00:14:25.052 --> 00:14:27.773]  Petty treats have been so honest, especially back in the day.
[00:14:27.793 --> 00:14:28.774]  I mean, it was just all true.
[00:14:29.034 --> 00:14:32.996]  No matter how horrible it sounded, no matter how horrible it was, it was true.
[00:14:33.436 --> 00:14:41.100]  When I read that the big textbooks being used by social services at colleges called the family a disease to be eradicated, I didn't believe it.
[00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:45.413]  Even when Dr. Dennis Cuddy wrote about it in one of his books, so I went and pulled it at the library, and it was true.
[00:14:46.013 --> 00:14:49.575]  Are you beginning to realize how bone-chilling this is?
[00:14:49.916 --> 00:14:53.938]  Let me read to you from the Rockefeller Foundation, Rockefeller Brothers Report.
[00:14:54.739 --> 00:15:05.306]  Quote, it continues, Similarly, the Rockefeller Education Board, which funded the creation of numerous public schools, issued a statement which read in part, Now hold on to your hats, and I have read this from the report.
[00:15:06.048 --> 00:15:12.610]  In our dreams, people yield themselves with perfect docility to our molding hands.
[00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:26.094]  The present educational conventions, intellectual and character education, fade from our minds, and unhampered by tradition, we work our own goodwill upon a grateful and responsive folk.
[00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:34.152]  We shall not try to make these people or any of their children into philosophers or men of learning or men of science.
[00:15:35.292 --> 00:15:36.012]  And it goes on.
[00:15:36.392 --> 00:15:42.373]  We have not to raise up from among us authors, educators, poets, or men of letters.
[00:15:42.533 --> 00:15:54.356]  We shall not search for the embryo of great artists, painters, musicians, nor lawyers, doctors, preachers, politicians, statements of whom we have ample sublime.
[00:15:54.976 --> 00:15:55.996]  Did you hear that?
[00:15:56.016 --> 00:15:56.416]  Unbelievable.
[00:15:56.516 --> 00:15:56.977]  Unbelievable.
[00:16:23.698 --> 00:16:26.701]  These are the founders of the public education system in America.
[00:16:27.002 --> 00:16:44.441]  The agenda from the very start was to eliminate all forms of objective thought and use education to produce automatons of the state who would shrink from embracing higher forms of intellectual pursuit and truly understand their role as a potential to advance freedom in human society ever upward and onward.
[00:16:44.981 --> 00:16:54.563]  No wonder that today a portion, a majority, one in a thousand can quote the First Amendment partially, of Americans think the First Amendment includes the right to own a pet.
[00:16:54.583 --> 00:16:55.583]  That's what many of them thought.
[00:16:56.004 --> 00:17:01.965]  Lack of sufficient education about our freedoms and where they came from puts the free world in peril.
[00:17:02.245 --> 00:17:10.807]  If we do not increase our efforts to inform and enlighten, tyrants will not squander their opportunity to create a prison planet.
[00:17:11.448 --> 00:17:25.193]  Again, lack of sufficient education about our freedoms and where they came from puts the free world in peril, and if we don't increase our efforts to inform and enlighten, tyrants will not squander their opportunity to create a prison planet.
[00:17:26.644 --> 00:17:43.971]  When you read them saying the family's a disease and to be eradicated, and CPS doubles the number of children grabbed each year exponentially, when you read how they say they're going to force-drug half of us with the new Freedom Initiative, when you read when Brzezinski calls us slaves, and we act like it.
[00:17:44.211 --> 00:17:45.331]  We act like slaves.
[00:17:45.571 --> 00:17:46.612]  We act like slaves.
[00:17:46.712 --> 00:17:53.474]  And so when you see one of these people in the general public who can't think and gibbers and giggles when you warn them, they're ruined.
[00:17:53.994 --> 00:17:55.415]  They're completely ruined.
[00:17:57.038 --> 00:18:05.523]  Edward Bernays, the father of modern PR, died when he was 90-something years old, a total genius, who designed modern propaganda, called us stupid slaves.
[00:18:05.563 --> 00:18:09.946]  But he said, if you think the public's dumb now, wait till we're done with you.
[00:18:10.286 --> 00:18:12.848]  Ha ha ha, the scum will never read what I'm writing.
[00:18:13.048 --> 00:18:14.729]  They're too busy watching television.
[00:18:15.979 --> 00:18:17.340]  He said that back in the 60s.
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.741]  That's how arrogant they are.
[00:18:18.761 --> 00:18:19.921]  They laugh at you.
[00:18:20.282 --> 00:18:27.005]  It's like I read an article in the Chronicle this week saying the toll roads aren't far known and it's no big deal and you're dumb, lazy Texans.
[00:18:27.025 --> 00:18:39.933]  It actually says this and it's all lies and the guy writing it, the editor, Louis Black, knows that the general public is literally dumbed down to the point where they can't even form sentences.
[00:18:41.269 --> 00:18:44.733]  That's why when you try to talk to some people, they don't want to hear from you because they're embarrassed, folks.
[00:18:45.034 --> 00:18:48.678]  They think you're showing off when you're, hey, listen, foreigners own the toll roads.
[00:18:48.698 --> 00:18:50.040]  They're going to put transponders on the cars.
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:50.621]  Fight it!
[00:18:50.641 --> 00:18:52.563]  They're like, uh, uh, uh.
[00:18:52.643 --> 00:18:54.185]  They don't even know what foreigner means.
[00:18:54.205 --> 00:18:55.327]  They don't know anything.
[00:18:56.027 --> 00:18:57.129]  They've been destroyed.
[00:18:57.149 --> 00:18:57.329]  Destroyed.
[00:18:58.115 --> 00:19:08.499]  Scientifically, there are tens of thousands of 170 IQ eggheads working in every major university with different parts of the puzzle openly how to brainwash you.
[00:19:08.559 --> 00:19:15.702]  The UT psychology department, I've been given a tour of it, the unclassified areas, and the entire thing, 90 plus percent was DARPA.
[00:19:17.217 --> 00:19:19.098]  They would have up on the door of each laboratory.
[00:19:19.118 --> 00:19:20.979]  They don't even teach students over there, predominantly.
[00:19:21.219 --> 00:19:23.681]  It's just labs with professors paid off by the Pentagon.
[00:19:24.201 --> 00:19:26.402]  And it'll say what the project's for.
[00:19:26.462 --> 00:19:27.503]  Mind control, mind control.
[00:19:27.743 --> 00:19:34.986]  Whole labs just at UT testing flicker rates on monkeys to see what mesmerizes homo sapiens sapiens.
[00:19:35.307 --> 00:19:36.827]  You understand what you're under?
[00:19:37.047 --> 00:19:38.608]  What you're being attacked with?
[00:19:39.589 --> 00:19:45.071]  Scientifically crafted mass brainwashing mechanisms.
[00:19:45.232 --> 00:19:45.772]  Weapons.
[00:19:46.801 --> 00:19:54.226]  But if you haven't been completely destroyed by them, if your psyche and your critical thinking skills haven't been wrecked, you can grow them back.
[00:19:54.266 --> 00:19:56.108]  You can break free from the matrix.
[00:19:56.508 --> 00:19:57.449]  More coming up.
[00:19:57.709 --> 00:19:58.750]  It gets a lot worse.
[00:20:02.833 --> 00:20:08.437]  Did you know that business opportunity seekers worldwide are discovering the powerful opportunities in foreign exchange trading?
[00:20:08.857 --> 00:20:13.080]  In Forex, there are no employees, advertising, products, or organizations to build.
[00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:15.662]  It's just you, the Internet, and your computer.

[00:20:53.243 --> 00:20:54.704]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[00:20:54.924 --> 00:20:55.585]  One and the same.
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:21.283]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:21:21.703 --> 00:21:24.824]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:21:25.084 --> 00:21:26.925]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:21:26.985 --> 00:21:30.006]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:21:30.546 --> 00:21:32.766]  Here is reality.
[00:21:33.127 --> 00:21:36.708]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:21:37.188 --> 00:21:40.809]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:45.165]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[00:21:45.606 --> 00:21:49.331]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.
[00:21:49.692 --> 00:21:51.174]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:51.214 --> 00:21:51.454]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.556 --> 00:22:02.256]  Hello, folks.
[00:22:02.296 --> 00:22:09.119]  This is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger, your source for free solar electricity.
[00:22:09.379 --> 00:22:16.482]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[00:22:16.622 --> 00:22:28.167]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[00:22:28.527 --> 00:22:30.128]  Its multi-voltage capabilities
[00:22:30.128 --> 00:22:30.688]  We're good to go.
[00:23:01.953 --> 00:23:08.859]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[00:23:08.979 --> 00:23:21.911]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[00:23:22.091 --> 00:23:23.873]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[00:23:24.053 --> 00:23:24.553]  We're good to go.
[00:23:43.266 --> 00:23:43.746]  We're good to go.
[00:24:08.934 --> 00:24:11.775]  Monday through Friday, 11 to 2 Central Standard Time.
[00:24:11.815 --> 00:24:13.156]  We're fighting for humanity.
[00:24:13.176 --> 00:24:16.798]  I mean, this group's openly said they're dumbing us down to enslave us.
[00:24:17.318 --> 00:24:18.939]  It's in all their big policy reports.
[00:24:18.979 --> 00:24:20.700]  It's their dogma they're laughing at us.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.222]  And if you can just inform enough people and go, look, they're calling you slaves.
[00:24:24.242 --> 00:24:31.965]  Look, they say they're going to ruin your children's brains with scientifically crafted curriculum where the teachers, we're multi-generational into this now, dumber and dumber.
[00:24:32.206 --> 00:24:33.386]  They don't even know what they're doing.
[00:24:33.406 --> 00:24:35.047]  They don't even know why, quote, it doesn't work.
[00:24:37.145 --> 00:24:38.726]  I'm not even blaming the teachers.
[00:24:38.766 --> 00:24:40.487]  This has been scientifically crafted.
[00:24:40.527 --> 00:24:44.090]  Now, continuing, I already knew about this, but new details have come out.
[00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:47.232]  And I don't think it's an international communist conspiracy.
[00:24:47.892 --> 00:25:04.783]  As the chief of the political science department at Georgetown, Bill Clinton's mentor, Carol Quigley, said in his 900-plus page Tragedy and Hope in 1969, he said the international globalists, as he called them, the roundtable groups,
[00:25:05.578 --> 00:25:06.558]  There's another term he used.
[00:25:06.578 --> 00:25:12.481]  These international groups, they use fascism, communism, anything as long as it's centralized.
[00:25:13.122 --> 00:25:13.542]  Okay?
[00:25:13.882 --> 00:25:15.903]  As long as it's not free market.
[00:25:15.963 --> 00:25:19.245]  As long as it allows select corporations to control it.
[00:25:19.585 --> 00:25:20.625]  They don't want freedom.
[00:25:20.665 --> 00:25:22.386]  This is an interesting new development, though.
[00:25:22.746 --> 00:25:26.248]  Former Soviet dissident warns of EU socialist dictatorship.
[00:25:27.518 --> 00:25:33.464]  He saw documents detailing Rockefeller Trilateral Commission conspiracy to create a totalitarian federal super state.
[00:25:34.024 --> 00:25:42.912]  Well, when Mao died, David Rockefeller wrote a big obituary saying he loved the goals of communism and that he did a great job with the Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forward.
[00:25:42.932 --> 00:25:44.794]  I mean, that was in the New York Times.
[00:25:44.834 --> 00:25:52.061]  I have the original copy, and I put it in my book, the quote from the editorial, from the piece he did.
[00:25:52.984 --> 00:25:53.764]  When Mao died.
[00:25:53.784 --> 00:25:58.105]  I mean, we knew that the Rockefellers owned most of the factories along with Arm and Hammer in Russia and China.
[00:25:58.326 --> 00:26:00.866]  Then they made a select deal when the Bushes and Kissinger went over there.
[00:26:00.886 --> 00:26:02.247]  When Bush Sr.
[00:26:02.287 --> 00:26:02.807]  was the U.S.
[00:26:02.847 --> 00:26:11.369]  ambassador to China, they went and opened it up and said, you'll let select corporations build factories here with slave labor, and that will leverage out all competition and destroy the free market in America.
[00:26:11.409 --> 00:26:14.030]  We'll call it free market, and the people will go along with it.
[00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:18.591]  Then with the money they make with the slave labor, they can then buy up U.S.
[00:26:18.651 --> 00:26:19.131]  industries.
[00:26:20.372 --> 00:26:20.852]  Continuing...
[00:26:21.927 --> 00:26:33.217]  A former dissident who was imprisoned in Soviet gulags for a total of 12 years has warned that he personally saw secret documents in 1992 which outlined a conspiracy to turn the European Union into a socialist dictatorship.
[00:26:33.257 --> 00:26:34.658]  Well, look what they're trying to do right now.
[00:26:35.179 --> 00:26:45.548]  In a speech in Brussels, 63-year-old Vladimir Bovatsky described the contents of the still classified Pulteboro and Central Committee documents.
[00:26:46.048 --> 00:26:54.972]  The Soviet files outlined a plan from the 1980s onwards to hijack the European Union and turn it into what Blavatsky calls the E-U-S-S-R.
[00:26:56.253 --> 00:26:58.974]  It's one hand of the New World Order trying to work to do that.
[00:26:58.994 --> 00:27:00.074]  The Soviets ran nothing.
[00:27:00.255 --> 00:27:04.797]  A totalitarian federal super state with no accountability or representation.
[00:27:04.957 --> 00:27:10.019]  The policy was a conspiracy quite openly made by them, agreed upon and worked out.
[00:27:11.067 --> 00:27:25.972]  Bukovatsky, it's not Bukovatsky, it's Bukovatsky, describes an amazing meeting between President Gorbachev and representatives of the Trilateral Commission and who runs the Gen 21 program out of Presidio in San Francisco, Gorbachev Foundation, which included David Rockefeller and Henry Kissinger.
[00:27:26.512 --> 00:27:31.297]  In January of 89, for example, a delegation of the Trilateral Commission came to see Gorbachev.
[00:27:31.357 --> 00:27:46.652]  It included former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, former French President Valéry Grichard-Estaing, American banker David Rockefeller, and former U.S.
[00:27:46.672 --> 00:27:47.994]  Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
[00:27:48.394 --> 00:27:58.296]  They had a very nice conversation where they tried to explain to Gorbachev that Soviet Russia had to integrate into the financial institutions of the world, such as GATT, the IMF, and the World Bank.
[00:27:58.596 --> 00:27:59.756]  Let me just stop right here.
[00:27:59.816 --> 00:28:01.056]  Why do I know this is true?
[00:28:01.576 --> 00:28:09.298]  Because from dozens and dozens and dozens of other key data nexus points and documents I've seen that are declassified, I know it's already true.
[00:28:09.838 --> 00:28:11.138]  And here's another little key tidbit.
[00:28:13.078 --> 00:28:16.879]  One year before the supposed fall of the Berlin Wall...
[00:28:17.862 --> 00:28:35.448]  Jim Tucker, who's been going to Bilderberg meetings for 25 years, was able to get some of the waiters to steal out of the dining area at the big chateau they were meeting at what their talking points were, what was on the printed agenda.
[00:28:35.908 --> 00:28:39.989]  And that was the fall of Berlin Wall and a staged merger of Europe with Russia.
[00:28:40.169 --> 00:28:45.591]  So we already know this, but here's someone who saw documents from the Soviet angle on this, okay?
[00:28:47.105 --> 00:28:48.209]  It's unbelievable.
[00:28:50.115 --> 00:28:52.503]  The article's up on prisonplanet.com.
[00:28:52.543 --> 00:28:53.787]  I suggest you get it out to everybody.
[00:28:54.801 --> 00:29:09.111]  Quote, in the middle of it, Giscard suddenly takes the floor and says, Mr. President, I cannot tell you exactly when it will happen, probably within 15 years, but Europe is going to be a federal state and you have to prepare yourself for that.
[00:29:09.191 --> 00:29:11.832]  You have to work with us and the European leaders.
[00:29:12.153 --> 00:29:13.654]  How would you react to that?
[00:29:13.714 --> 00:29:20.858]  How would you allow other Eastern European countries to interact with it or how to become part of it if you have to be prepared?
[00:29:21.159 --> 00:29:22.520]  And again, where are our gulags?
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.021]  Where are the gulags that Halliburton runs,
[00:29:24.741 --> 00:29:26.302]  We're good to go.
[00:29:52.156 --> 00:29:53.116]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.537 --> 00:29:55.177]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.197 --> 00:29:58.839]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.301 --> 00:30:05.882]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:30:06.042 --> 00:30:08.203]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:30:08.483 --> 00:30:18.567]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[00:30:18.867 --> 00:30:21.208]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.

[00:31:02.558 --> 00:31:06.120]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:06.661]  are located?
[00:31:06.861 --> 00:31:10.263]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[00:32:02.034 --> 00:32:03.515]  Hey folks, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:32:03.855 --> 00:32:07.817]  You've all heard me on the radio talking about the importance of investing in precious metals.
[00:32:08.197 --> 00:32:11.719]  I feel it's time for me to talk about the importance of investing in your health.
[00:32:12.079 --> 00:32:15.641]  I was presented with the opportunity to try TriVibes from TriVortex.
[00:32:16.041 --> 00:32:20.904]  I was a bit hesitant of the idea of absorbing vitamins by wearing them rather than ingesting them.
[00:32:21.224 --> 00:32:27.028]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[00:32:27.329 --> 00:32:33.473]  I now wear my TriVibes bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever, not only physically, but also mentally.
[00:32:33.814 --> 00:32:39.578]  TriVortex also offers amazingly beneficial and beautiful jewelry worn by the women around the office daily.
[00:32:39.998 --> 00:32:41.179]  TriVortex is amazing.
[00:32:41.519 --> 00:32:42.620]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:48.125]  Try TriVortex yourself and have fun and learn with the test found on TriVortex.com.
[00:32:48.325 --> 00:32:51.787]  That's T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com.
[00:32:52.068 --> 00:32:53.389]  Or call my friend Brian at 619-884-1455.
[00:32:53.429 --> 00:32:53.709]  That's 619-884-1455.
[00:33:07.494 --> 00:33:07.955]  All right.
[00:33:08.055 --> 00:33:10.616]  I'm going to get more into the EU takeover, merger with Russia.
[00:33:10.656 --> 00:33:12.537]  And we're going to be taking your phone calls.
[00:33:12.617 --> 00:33:13.838]  I know we have loaded phones.
[00:33:13.878 --> 00:33:15.799]  We'll take them just here in a few minutes.
[00:33:27.999 --> 00:33:32.923]  James and John and Chris and Mark and Mike and many, many others that are patiently holding.
[00:33:32.943 --> 00:33:35.566]  I want to get into some of the new port deal developments.
[00:33:35.626 --> 00:33:37.427]  Lawmakers are being told to sit down and shut up.
[00:33:37.467 --> 00:33:38.368]  You don't do anything now.
[00:33:38.788 --> 00:33:40.490]  A rubber stamp, what the Empire says.
[00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:43.452]  We'll cover that as well.
[00:33:43.492 --> 00:33:45.374]  But before we go to your calls...
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:48.160]  I haven't had her on in a few weeks.
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:49.521]  We're always honored to have her.
[00:33:49.541 --> 00:33:50.481]  She's Debbie Morrow.
[00:33:50.901 --> 00:33:53.041]  New William Concepts is made in America.
[00:33:53.462 --> 00:33:56.402]  They are the national manufacturer and the national distributor.
[00:33:56.422 --> 00:33:58.163]  They manufacture American Big Berkeys.
[00:33:58.543 --> 00:34:01.743]  They also have British Big Berkeys, and they are the main group.
[00:34:02.103 --> 00:34:09.345]  And they have Debbie just for this radio show, just for their radio outreach, because people for years said, can't we just buy direct from you?
[00:34:09.405 --> 00:34:14.126]  So you get one of these filters at a little bit above the price, say, a distributor gets.
[00:34:14.901 --> 00:34:15.461]  We're good to go.
[00:34:38.535 --> 00:34:39.736]  It's really exciting.
[00:34:39.916 --> 00:34:40.937]  Made in America.
[00:34:41.017 --> 00:34:42.538]  If you want British, they've got that too.
[00:34:42.578 --> 00:34:44.419]  But the Made in America is even a new standard.
[00:34:44.779 --> 00:34:47.520]  They've got major university tests under an electron microscope.
[00:34:47.961 --> 00:34:56.466]  They send water through it, and a week later, they even give it a week to grow, they dump what they call lawn growth, basically swamp water, into the test, murky.
[00:34:56.946 --> 00:35:00.068]  And then a week later, there are no bacteria.
[00:35:00.508 --> 00:35:03.750]  That is a new standard of gravity filter.
[00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:04.670]  It is unbelievable.
[00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:05.551]  I have articles here.
[00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:09.402]  About how benzene is at eight times safe levels.
[00:35:09.422 --> 00:35:15.567]  They have an allowable level in the water supply, which studies show is very toxic to the liver and causes leukemia and a bunch of other diseases.
[00:35:15.607 --> 00:35:16.647]  I have that report today.
[00:35:16.948 --> 00:35:23.893]  But imagine your soft drinks eight times that level, and then they also use all that pesticide on the coca plants.
[00:35:24.413 --> 00:35:25.914]  Yes, it's like decaffeinated coffee.
[00:35:25.934 --> 00:35:32.519]  Coca-Cola, Pepsi, all of it has the cocaine alkaloids, the cocaine molecules that have been broken down
[00:35:33.119 --> 00:35:34.700]  So it doesn't get you the big high.
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:38.161]  It did back 70 years ago and had pure cocaine in it.
[00:35:38.201 --> 00:35:40.061]  So it's all been sprayed down with pesticide.
[00:35:40.361 --> 00:35:41.502]  The benzene's all in it.
[00:35:41.762 --> 00:35:47.044]  But it says every soft drink has this because of the toxins used in making it.
[00:35:48.684 --> 00:35:51.565]  Just an example of what you're drinking, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:51.845 --> 00:35:55.507]  We've all got to control ourselves and stop drinking tap water.
[00:35:55.527 --> 00:36:08.771]  You know, I'll brush my teeth with my non-fluoride toothpaste, but I'll catch myself drinking out of the tap, you know, hunching over it like I've been doing since I was three years old, and I'll stop myself and go downstairs and drink Berkey water, and we cook with reverse osmosis water.
[00:36:09.152 --> 00:36:10.512]  Debbie, good to have you on with us.
[00:36:11.092 --> 00:36:11.733]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:36:11.853 --> 00:36:15.314]  I'm always glad to be here, and I'll do my best to be on more often.
[00:36:15.982 --> 00:36:19.603]  Debbie, you've got some new specials and new Berkeys out.
[00:36:19.683 --> 00:36:22.663]  Tell us about those different units and what they do and why folks need them.
[00:36:23.624 --> 00:36:35.626]  Well, we have the new Travel Berkey, which I think is really, really a good product because it's a smaller Berkey than the big Berkey.
[00:36:35.686 --> 00:36:37.626]  It only holds a gallon and a half.
[00:36:38.187 --> 00:36:39.887]  It's made out of stainless steel.
[00:36:41.027 --> 00:36:43.708]  It's available everywhere except Iowa.
[00:36:44.628 --> 00:36:44.808]  And
[00:36:45.777 --> 00:36:49.878]  You can hold two black Berkey purification elements in it.
[00:36:50.478 --> 00:36:58.181]  So it's real handy if you've got a smaller apartment or if you're just a single person and you don't want something as big as the big Berkey.
[00:36:58.681 --> 00:37:02.582]  Also great for boats, RVs, camping.
[00:37:02.702 --> 00:37:04.022]  It's our travel Berkey.
[00:37:04.803 --> 00:37:12.465]  And with that, you can get a free Berkey base so you can set it up on the counter and still get a glass under it.
[00:37:13.144 --> 00:37:16.307]  Or you can get a Berkey sport bottle.
[00:37:17.568 --> 00:37:28.076]  Now for those that don't know, if you go to the EPA's own website, they have thousands of allowable chemicals, carcinogens in the water, to levels they say is permissible.
[00:37:28.863 --> 00:37:33.808]  And some cities like Dallas or Houston that I've drunk water out of, or L.A., I mean, it tastes like kerosene.
[00:37:34.208 --> 00:37:35.830]  How do people give this to their children?
[00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:42.216]  Then they go out and get a bottle of water, which usually has, according to major studies, higher levels of bacteria in it.
[00:37:42.536 --> 00:37:46.019]  There was just one about ice from the fast food places.
[00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:51.785]  It has many, many times the bacteria level in it that even tap water does.
[00:37:51.825 --> 00:37:52.626]  Folks, bottom line...
[00:37:53.546 --> 00:37:57.929]  Water is life, and there's big problems with the water supply system in this country.
[00:37:58.469 --> 00:38:01.991]  And let's say you keep forgetting to bring the water from your Berkey with you to work.
[00:38:02.071 --> 00:38:05.433]  Get a sports bottle, and then that doesn't cut everything out.
[00:38:05.473 --> 00:38:09.975]  It just cuts 90-plus percent out and makes it safe to drink, swamp water, you name it.
[00:38:10.335 --> 00:38:13.237]  You've got those for, what, $20-something a piece, normally about $35 at the store.
[00:38:13.257 --> 00:38:15.978]  And then you have a deal where you get five for $99, a huge discount.
[00:38:21.343 --> 00:38:22.044]  That's right.
[00:38:22.444 --> 00:38:29.149]  And the Berkey Sport Bottles, you know, it's getting to be that time of year where people are going to be traveling and going to spring break things.
[00:38:29.229 --> 00:38:33.873]  And the Berkey Sport Bottles are just tremendous to have with you everywhere, you know.
[00:38:34.213 --> 00:38:37.055]  And don't leave out our KDF shower filters.
[00:38:38.156 --> 00:38:40.258]  You were saying about brushing your teeth.
[00:38:40.638 --> 00:38:44.041]  I like to get in the shower, you know, with my KDF shower filter.
[00:38:44.421 --> 00:38:46.102]  And I have one of those handheld water...
[00:38:47.216 --> 00:38:53.100]  Well, it really is the number one health-wise thing you can do that takes immediate action that we know is real and provable.
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:56.603]  The water is full of poison and you breathe in the fumes and
[00:39:16.657 --> 00:39:26.201]  And even if you're drinking purified water, you're getting major exposure through the filtration systems at the big water plants, all the chemicals they're adding.
[00:39:26.221 --> 00:39:28.121]  So you need this filter to add.
[00:39:28.221 --> 00:39:29.122]  How much are those, Debbie?
[00:39:29.562 --> 00:39:34.204]  The KDF shower filters, they're normally $49, and we have them on sale for $35.
[00:39:35.504 --> 00:39:42.527]  And I've had lots of people call me lately who, because of all the droughts that we're seeing all over
[00:39:43.157 --> 00:39:47.179]  They say their water smells and tastes even worse than ever, you know?
[00:39:47.339 --> 00:40:00.985]  Yeah, the other day I turned it on here at the office and it came out brown, literally brown in the sink, and that's because the aquifers have gotten so low that all the crud sits down there at the bottom for thousands of years and they're sucking them dry, so it's so toxic right now.
[00:40:01.305 --> 00:40:02.705]  It's just off the chart.
[00:40:02.925 --> 00:40:07.748]  It really is, and so if we can take control of one thing in our life, it's your water.
[00:40:07.768 --> 00:40:11.049]  You know, I always like to encourage people to realize that
[00:40:11.533 --> 00:40:19.255]  You know, lots of people are spending lots of money on different preparedness items, but remember that the Berkey water filters aren't for preparedness.
[00:40:19.755 --> 00:40:22.756]  They are great to have if, God forbid, something bad happens.
[00:40:22.776 --> 00:40:23.096]  No, that's right.
[00:40:23.116 --> 00:40:26.998]  A lot of preparedness stuff just sits in the attic or sits in the basement or in the garage.
[00:40:27.118 --> 00:40:27.318]  Right.
[00:40:27.358 --> 00:40:28.918]  This is something you use every day.
[00:40:29.118 --> 00:40:29.758]  That's right.
[00:40:29.858 --> 00:40:31.019]  You're getting your money's worth.
[00:40:31.439 --> 00:40:34.720]  In a month's time, you've got it paid for if you buy a bottle of water.
[00:40:35.402 --> 00:40:35.942]  That's right.
[00:40:36.243 --> 00:40:37.463]  Debbie, I want to give the number out.
[00:40:37.543 --> 00:40:39.024]  It's 1-888-803-4438.
[00:40:39.624 --> 00:40:42.766]  If you call, the number's busy.
[00:40:42.806 --> 00:40:43.406]  Leave your name and number.
[00:40:43.426 --> 00:40:46.688]  She'll call you right back.
[00:40:46.708 --> 00:40:46.908]  888-803-4438.
[00:40:47.208 --> 00:40:48.909]  Or go to BerkeyWater.com.
[00:40:48.929 --> 00:40:51.151]  We have a big banner on Infowars.com over to them.
[00:40:51.411 --> 00:40:52.671]  Tell them what free gift you want.
[00:40:52.711 --> 00:40:57.674]  They have those listed sports bottles, sheltering in place, DVDs, and other great things.
[00:40:57.714 --> 00:41:00.776]  Potassium iodate to protect in case there's a radiological event.
[00:41:00.796 --> 00:41:02.817]  They've given it to all the firemen and police and everything.
[00:41:03.297 --> 00:41:04.338]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:41:04.359 --> 00:41:04.839]  Thank you.
[00:41:20.878 --> 00:41:21.959]  You bet.
[00:41:22.019 --> 00:41:25.242]  We like to have her on usually every week, but it's been a few weeks, so we'll have her on a little bit longer.
[00:41:25.542 --> 00:41:27.684]  Thank you for staying with us through that, but it's important.
[00:41:27.964 --> 00:41:30.486]  And speak of the devil, we'll go to the calls in just a moment.
[00:41:30.506 --> 00:41:31.387]  Let me just read this to you.
[00:41:31.727 --> 00:41:33.449]  This is the Times of London today.
[00:41:34.591 --> 00:41:38.213]  Soft drinks found to have high levels of cancer chemicals.
[00:41:38.914 --> 00:41:46.918]  Traces of carcinogenic chemical have been found in soft drinks at eight times the level permitted in drinking water was revealed last night.
[00:41:47.338 --> 00:41:57.024]  Tests conducted on 230 drinks on sale in Britain and France have identified high levels of benzene, a compound known to cause cancer according to the Food Standards Agency.
[00:41:57.424 --> 00:42:02.109]  There is a legal limit of the per billions of benzene in British drinking water.
[00:42:02.449 --> 00:42:07.093]  The latest test revealed levels of up to 8 parts per billion in the soft drinks.
[00:42:07.173 --> 00:42:09.956]  Benzene has been linked to leukemia and other cancers.
[00:42:09.996 --> 00:42:19.185]  The blood traces found in the Perrier River 15 years ago led to the withdrawal of more than 160 billion bottles worldwide.
[00:42:19.545 --> 00:42:26.347]  The disclosure has prompted food safety campaigners to demand that the government reveal which products contain benzene.
[00:42:26.668 --> 00:42:33.090]  At present, the drinks identified have not been revealed or removed, and they are 230 brands.
[00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:44.314]  And that is Richard Watts of Susten, a pressure group lobbying for better food standards, said that this should be done urgently because the drinks aren't being marketed to children.
[00:42:45.484 --> 00:42:54.849]  The scientific evidence is unclear about whether there is any safe level of benzene, but this is eight times according to the level the government says is safe, and it goes on and on.
[00:42:55.269 --> 00:42:59.071]  All right, let's go ahead now and go to your phone calls.
[00:42:59.091 --> 00:43:01.672]  I'm going to move quickly through these, and I'm able to do that.
[00:43:01.732 --> 00:43:02.532]  Who's up first here?
[00:43:04.233 --> 00:43:05.334]  Thomas in New York.
[00:43:05.374 --> 00:43:06.394]  You're on the air, Thomas.
[00:43:06.434 --> 00:43:06.895]  Go ahead.
[00:43:08.295 --> 00:43:11.377]  Greetings from the eastern shore of Lake Ontario.
[00:43:11.457 --> 00:43:11.817]  Welcome.
[00:43:12.409 --> 00:43:17.451]  I'm a long-time listener, first-time caller, and a lifetime member of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:43:17.731 --> 00:43:19.971]  You're the man.
[00:43:20.411 --> 00:43:23.252]  This has to do with a subject yesterday at concentration camps.
[00:43:23.592 --> 00:43:26.793]  I was doing some research when I ran across Andersonville, Georgia.
[00:43:26.813 --> 00:43:29.354]  You ever hear of that prison during the Civil War?
[00:43:29.614 --> 00:43:29.894]  Yes.
[00:43:30.715 --> 00:43:40.157]  If anyone thinks that Americans can't do the despicable things that they're going to do to other Americans, you should do some research on Andersonville.
[00:43:40.217 --> 00:43:42.018]  Andersonville was the one in the swamp.
[00:43:42.555 --> 00:43:42.876]  Oh, yes.
[00:43:43.817 --> 00:43:49.245]  It was built for $13,000 and they shoved $45,000 into it.
[00:43:49.606 --> 00:43:51.068]  Nothing to protect them from the elements.
[00:43:51.428 --> 00:43:53.512]  No walls, no ceilings, no blankets.
[00:43:53.592 --> 00:43:55.795]  If you were lucky, you got to eat once a day.
[00:43:57.037 --> 00:43:57.698]  It was pretty bad.
[00:43:58.465 --> 00:44:01.166]  Well, that's what FEMA is doing.
[00:44:01.546 --> 00:44:05.648]  They openly have designated sites, and it's these big military bases with barbed wire facing in.
[00:44:06.128 --> 00:44:12.231]  And then openly in a big warehouse, they'll have cots and porta-potties waiting and some sortable food.
[00:44:12.711 --> 00:44:14.572]  And that's the camps, and they admit that's the camps.
[00:44:14.592 --> 00:44:16.013]  Now declassified, now public.
[00:44:16.313 --> 00:44:18.694]  It's called Operation End Game.
[00:44:19.975 --> 00:44:21.875]  What do you think of that name, End Game?
[00:44:21.895 --> 00:44:27.658]  Yeah, I've run across it a while back when I was doing my research on concentration camps, FEMA.
[00:44:29.345 --> 00:44:30.346]  It's pretty scary.
[00:44:31.647 --> 00:44:32.748]  It won't take me a lot, though.
[00:44:33.709 --> 00:44:39.315]  Well, I think you should let them take you and let them beat you to death and burn you with cigarettes like they do in Iraq.
[00:44:39.335 --> 00:44:39.856]  That's freedom.
[00:44:40.216 --> 00:44:41.718]  Yeah, that's the new freedom.
[00:44:42.178 --> 00:44:43.740]  No, sir, you don't have a right to resist.
[00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:45.462]  You get on the truck and you go to the camp.
[00:44:45.762 --> 00:44:47.604]  It would be evil for us to fight back.
[00:44:47.624 --> 00:44:49.066]  We need to submit to our government like...
[00:44:49.786 --> 00:44:50.626]  It's just like a sheep.
[00:44:50.666 --> 00:44:55.927]  When a coyote or a wolf runs up to it, the sheep just lays over, and the wolf starts eating it from the hind end up.
[00:44:56.788 --> 00:45:01.809]  Just pulls their guts right out their hind end and eats them right there, and it just lays there braying.
[00:45:02.409 --> 00:45:03.489]  That's how you're supposed to act.
[00:45:03.689 --> 00:45:05.610]  Home of the slave, land of the sheep.
[00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:10.051]  Our forefathers demand we roll over to them.
[00:45:11.691 --> 00:45:16.692]  Gary Hart was on C-SPAN this morning, and I only caught the last ten minutes of it, but I was waiting for someone to call.
[00:45:17.674 --> 00:45:19.776]  Ask them about the Bilderbergers, but they never did.
[00:45:22.157 --> 00:45:23.098]  That would have been interesting.
[00:45:23.118 --> 00:45:29.182]  Or ask how he said three days after 9-11 we need to use this disaster for what President Bush's father called for a New World Order.
[00:45:29.482 --> 00:45:32.224]  He's all for the Ford deal.
[00:45:33.745 --> 00:45:40.430]  Well, hey, I've got a big article where Congress is angry, but they've been told to shut up, so they're just going to back off and do what committee chairmen say.
[00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:44.713]  See, hey, you don't like it, the people don't like it, shut up!
[00:45:44.733 --> 00:45:45.153]  That's right.
[00:45:45.194 --> 00:45:47.095]  Just shut up and sit down!
[00:45:47.908 --> 00:45:50.429]  Well, that's about all I had to say, Alex.
[00:45:50.689 --> 00:45:51.449]  Good to hear from you.
[00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:53.230]  It's here in the news.
[00:45:53.330 --> 00:45:54.531]  I just told them, shut up!
[00:45:55.611 --> 00:45:57.172]  You understand we're in receivership?
[00:45:57.332 --> 00:45:57.712]  Shut up!
[00:45:58.872 --> 00:46:01.173]  You want some more anthrax letters, the White House says?
[00:46:01.814 --> 00:46:03.834]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in New Jersey.
[00:46:03.874 --> 00:46:04.755]  John, you're on the air.
[00:46:06.075 --> 00:46:07.436]  John hung up right as I went to him.
[00:46:07.476 --> 00:46:07.836]  All righty.
[00:46:07.856 --> 00:46:08.716]  Is Chris there?
[00:46:09.557 --> 00:46:11.377]  Chris, where are you calling us from today?
[00:46:11.397 --> 00:46:13.398]  Sierra Vista, Arizona.
[00:46:13.458 --> 00:46:14.599]  Cochise County, Arizona.
[00:46:14.899 --> 00:46:15.659]  Ah, yes, welcome.
[00:46:16.896 --> 00:46:22.019]  Yeah, Alex, I know exactly what you're talking about with the public schools that you were mentioning earlier.
[00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:26.082]  You know, the public schools, I do believe, are designed to ruin our children.
[00:46:26.102 --> 00:46:27.403]  Well, there's no believing it.
[00:46:27.583 --> 00:46:31.165]  Their own official foundational documents say so.
[00:46:31.925 --> 00:46:32.726]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:32.986 --> 00:46:41.311]  You know, and I'm trying to tell people now, you can go on the website, the CIA website, where they admit that they carry out a terrorist attack and they brag about it.
[00:46:41.571 --> 00:46:42.752]  You know, they blame it on their enemies.
[00:46:43.234 --> 00:46:51.277]  And that's just like, what more can you say once that's proven, once that's out there on their own government website?
[00:46:51.757 --> 00:47:00.401]  But people are so interested in football or, like you said, the Simpsons, you know, and just everything else, just the Bible, you know.
[00:47:01.281 --> 00:47:04.463]  Well, some of them will say, yeah, the government might do that, but what about Al-Qaeda?
[00:47:04.503 --> 00:47:06.223]  You go, no, no, no, see, Al-Qaeda's the government.
[00:47:06.723 --> 00:47:09.645]  Yeah, but Al-Qaeda, but hold on, the government says they did it, huh?
[00:47:10.765 --> 00:47:12.826]  Yeah, you know, and that's why I'm saying, you know,
[00:47:14.165 --> 00:47:20.929]  I've been personally making copies of like Martial Law and just trying to get stuff out there and just trying to get people to watch this stuff.
[00:47:21.089 --> 00:47:32.157]  And it's like, you know, you watch one video and I guarantee you're at least going to have at least a little bit of a different outlook, even if you don't believe everything that something says on a video.
[00:47:32.257 --> 00:47:37.540]  I mean, but the most of the video, everything in the video, in fact, is hardcore documented.
[00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:39.742]  And, you know, you can Google all of it.
[00:47:39.802 --> 00:47:41.983]  And I, you know, I write notes with it to people.
[00:47:42.043 --> 00:47:43.204]  Go Google this, you know.
[00:47:44.054 --> 00:47:45.435]  Watch this and then Google it.
[00:47:45.475 --> 00:47:51.238]  Well, a great listener built a bibliography second by second for my new film, Martial Law.
[00:47:51.299 --> 00:47:53.320]  It's MartialLaw911.info.
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:55.481]  We have a link to it on InfoWars.
[00:47:56.161 --> 00:48:01.945]  And every claim we make in the film, he has the time code and then a link to the document.
[00:48:02.645 --> 00:48:08.449]  I'm going to have to go ahead and get on that because I'm going to print that out then and get people to see that too because...
[00:48:09.079 --> 00:48:12.904]  You know, I passed out a lot of copies of that, and then American Dictators.
[00:48:13.085 --> 00:48:14.406]  So you did what I talked about.
[00:48:14.506 --> 00:48:20.194]  You went and did a search on CIA.gov for government-sponsored terror from those days.
[00:48:20.214 --> 00:48:21.456]  Yeah, that's what we were talking about on the show.
[00:48:21.841 --> 00:48:31.449]  And, you know, a lot of those ones, when I would do the search, I would go in, and some of the links now, it says that they're not found or removed from the server.
[00:48:31.589 --> 00:48:32.410]  Yeah, I noticed that.
[00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:34.652]  It's funny you said that, and I printed it off and saved it.
[00:48:35.273 --> 00:48:40.277]  A couple days after I did that, I tried to go back, and, like, links to documents are dead now.
[00:48:40.757 --> 00:48:41.478]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:42.038 --> 00:48:47.323]  You know, when you were talking about, like, the second day on your show, I believe, when you brought it up the second time,
[00:48:47.907 --> 00:48:49.889]  I started trying to research some of it.
[00:48:49.909 --> 00:48:51.551]  You know, you ought to write an article about that.
[00:48:51.591 --> 00:48:53.053]  You ought to go to the Google Cache.
[00:48:53.113 --> 00:48:54.014]  In fact, I'm so busy.
[00:48:54.034 --> 00:48:56.637]  The other night I noticed this and I thought, I ought to talk about it.
[00:48:56.657 --> 00:48:57.918]  I ought to go to the Google Cache.
[00:48:58.199 --> 00:49:01.242]  I ought to show how it's saved and how now it's being taken down.
[00:49:02.123 --> 00:49:02.363]  Yeah.
[00:49:02.824 --> 00:49:03.765]  It's unbelievable.
[00:49:04.566 --> 00:49:05.127]  Good idea.
[00:49:05.147 --> 00:49:06.228]  I'm trying to start, you know.
[00:49:07.032 --> 00:49:11.378]  An organization on my own, you know, with a couple friends here locally, just to get some information out.
[00:49:11.719 --> 00:49:13.080]  That's how big things start, brother.
[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:14.482]  Just put one foot in front of the other.
[00:49:14.502 --> 00:49:15.083]  Good to hear from you.
[00:49:15.824 --> 00:49:17.927]  Let's talk to Mark in Mass.
[00:49:17.967 --> 00:49:18.768]  You're on the air, sir.
[00:49:22.981 --> 00:49:24.222]  All right, Mark, you want to talk?
[00:49:24.242 --> 00:49:24.722]  Hello.
[00:49:25.043 --> 00:49:25.283]  Yes.
[00:49:25.543 --> 00:49:26.364]  Hello, Alex, how are you?
[00:49:26.584 --> 00:49:26.784]  Fine.
[00:49:27.124 --> 00:49:28.345]  Okay.
[00:49:28.485 --> 00:49:31.707]  I have a 9-11 question, a related question I would like to ask.
[00:49:31.908 --> 00:49:32.488]  Sure, go ahead.
[00:49:33.409 --> 00:49:49.981]  There are a lot of people who think that 9-11 was a total inside job, a complete inside job, but a large portion of the pre-knowledge argument surrounds terrorists or Al-Qaeda threats.
[00:49:51.294 --> 00:49:55.236]  So I was wondering if you can clear up that apparent conflict there.
[00:49:55.817 --> 00:49:57.318]  There is no conflict there.
[00:49:57.658 --> 00:50:05.143]  Good parts of the government were picking up the history that their agents were creating as what they thought was part of a drill.
[00:50:05.523 --> 00:50:13.508]  It was a drill on the surface to see if authorities would, quote, notice a terrorist attack in progress.
[00:50:13.688 --> 00:50:17.970]  The Navy SEALs do this all the time where they practice attacking and invading U.S.
[00:50:18.051 --> 00:50:18.471]  embassies.
[00:50:19.205 --> 00:50:25.888]  And so, in case they got caught carrying out the op, it was, oh, quote, just a drill at multiple levels.
[00:50:25.948 --> 00:50:40.594]  So that shows how there was government prior knowledge and involvement that when good elements of defense intelligence and other groups were picking up the chatter, they would then tell them to shut it down and not stop them.
[00:50:40.774 --> 00:50:42.915]  So that adds to the argument, sir.
[00:50:43.376 --> 00:50:46.557]  Well, I'm talking about as far as Robert Wright, David Shippers...
[00:50:47.319 --> 00:50:49.821]  All those arguments surround Al Qaeda threats.
[00:50:50.221 --> 00:50:51.422]  Let me find out where you're at.
[00:50:51.702 --> 00:50:53.163]  You don't think the government carried out 9-11?
[00:50:53.183 --> 00:50:55.625]  Well, I have my suspicions.
[00:50:56.566 --> 00:50:57.126]  Well, stay there.
[00:50:57.146 --> 00:50:59.048]  Let me try to answer your questions when we get back.
[00:50:59.788 --> 00:51:00.989]  They said they were going to carry it out.
[00:51:01.029 --> 00:51:01.470]  They didn't.
[00:51:02.791 --> 00:51:05.653]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:51:06.383 --> 00:51:07.664]  Alex Jones here, America.

[00:52:48.918 --> 00:52:51.579]  The Berkey Security Pack, a retail value of $518 for only $399.
[00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:55.200]  We're good to go.
[00:53:18.513 --> 00:53:19.154]  We're good to go.
[00:53:38.729 --> 00:53:39.810]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:53:39.830 --> 00:53:41.651]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:12.114 --> 00:54:12.774]  Simplify.
[00:54:12.834 --> 00:54:13.654]  Maybe I'm stupid.
[00:54:14.094 --> 00:54:16.275]  Simplify your question so I can understand it.
[00:54:16.295 --> 00:54:19.156]  My question is basically this.
[00:54:19.216 --> 00:54:31.658]  Very often when conspiracy theorists try to argue that America was involved in 9-11, they use arguments, for instance, that David Shippers warned us, that Robert Wright warned us.
[00:54:32.379 --> 00:54:38.600]  But then on the other hand, when they actually talk about who was involved, very often they'll only say that America was involved.
[00:54:39.042 --> 00:54:42.827]  Well, sir, there is just hundreds of conflicts between different people's views on how 9-11 was carried out.
[00:54:42.847 --> 00:54:44.589]  My view is the correct view.
[00:54:44.669 --> 00:54:46.431]  My view is the research view.
[00:54:46.451 --> 00:54:48.673]  My view is the view of...
[00:54:59.966 --> 00:55:08.949]  Pre-9-11, on the day of 9-11, my view is the same view as it was the day it happened, from operational things we've seen in the past, and then from all of the evidence.
[00:55:09.009 --> 00:55:18.372]  I mean, David Shippers was first interviewed here, the head impeachment lawyer, and he talked about how FBI was ordered to stand down and not go after, quote, the hijackers.
[00:55:18.672 --> 00:55:21.813]  He just hasn't figured out that they weren't hijackers, they were U.S.
[00:55:21.853 --> 00:55:22.553]  government agents.
[00:55:22.593 --> 00:55:24.214]  We have the proof of that in triplicate.
[00:55:25.074 --> 00:55:30.858]  So, yes, you can go out and find people who think the government was involved, they funded it, they let it happen, or they ran the whole lot.
[00:55:31.098 --> 00:55:34.500]  And when I say government, I mean criminal elements within the government.
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:36.621]  So, I mean, you can find conflicts all day.
[00:55:36.641 --> 00:55:42.525]  You can find nutcases that think holograms hit the towers, and they're probably operatives trying to make us all look stupid.
[00:55:42.545 --> 00:55:43.506]  But it isn't a conflict.
[00:55:43.566 --> 00:55:45.827]  They're different views on historical events.
[00:55:46.627 --> 00:55:54.092]  Well, yeah, but speaking specifically of yourself, now you yourself have used arguments like the Manila Air plot,
[00:55:54.764 --> 00:56:00.849]  Robert Wright, Pauline Riley, etc., etc., all these people who... Sir, you don't think 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:56:00.889 --> 00:56:02.850]  In fact, I believe you've called before.
[00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:03.470]  That's right.
[00:56:03.631 --> 00:56:09.395]  And you've called other shows, and so you believe it's, quote, all a conspiracy theory.
[00:56:09.415 --> 00:56:11.676]  Before the break, you said you had your suspicions.
[00:56:12.057 --> 00:56:13.678]  You have your suspicions towards what?
[00:56:13.958 --> 00:56:23.145]  Because you're just trying to use a very lame debating technique that they teach junior high debaters to cast false dispersions at me, and it's not going to work.
[00:56:23.465 --> 00:56:25.047]  Well, I think it's a powerful argument, though.
[00:56:25.347 --> 00:56:26.128]  It's totally weak.
[00:56:26.168 --> 00:56:27.088]  You can use the word powerful.
[00:56:27.128 --> 00:56:27.449]  It's weak.
[00:56:28.690 --> 00:56:29.110]  You're weak.
[00:56:29.491 --> 00:56:30.692]  Well, that's your opinion.
[00:56:30.712 --> 00:56:32.013]  Go back to your government job, buddy.
[00:56:32.794 --> 00:56:36.817]  You're not going to stop people from going to CIA.gov where they admit they carry out terror attacks.
[00:56:37.117 --> 00:56:40.440]  Are you denying the CIA admits they carried out terror attacks to blame it on Mosaddegh?
[00:56:41.001 --> 00:56:42.983]  It's something that I actually don't know about.
[00:56:43.203 --> 00:56:43.603]  Oh, yeah.
[00:56:43.643 --> 00:56:44.424]  Very, very nice.
[00:56:44.444 --> 00:56:45.365]  Just say you don't know about it.
[00:56:45.385 --> 00:56:47.146]  I would have to plead ignorance, I'm being honest.
[00:56:47.367 --> 00:56:48.608]  You need to plead a lot of ignorance.
[00:56:49.424 --> 00:56:56.406]  In my argument, I go through the arguments and I say, okay, number one, Bush says there was no prior knowledge, there was no memo.
[00:56:56.566 --> 00:56:58.626]  Then the memo goes public, there was prior knowledge.
[00:56:59.366 --> 00:57:01.287]  Then we show that there wasn't just prior knowledge.
[00:57:01.607 --> 00:57:06.428]  They ordered the FBI and Defense Intelligence and CIA and the good departments to back off.
[00:57:06.628 --> 00:57:11.589]  So that proves that they're lying to us, just like you impeach a witness on the witness stand if I was a prosecutor.
[00:57:11.809 --> 00:57:12.909]  Then I march through and say...
[00:57:13.149 --> 00:57:15.250]  Now, isn't it true that you really committed the crime?
[00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:16.110]  Isn't it true?
[00:57:16.271 --> 00:57:18.051]  And then I bring out the evidence and show that.
[00:57:18.312 --> 00:57:19.092]  Thank you for the call.
[00:57:19.352 --> 00:57:19.912]  Nice try.
[00:57:19.972 --> 00:57:22.894]  Call the other weak-minded shows where you might get some traction, buddy.
[00:57:23.694 --> 00:57:24.535]  Makes me sick.
[00:57:26.415 --> 00:57:28.977]  I mean, you know, they call up with these little sneaky debates.
[00:57:28.997 --> 00:57:30.657]  They need to go back to their government jobs.
[00:57:31.078 --> 00:57:32.178]  Everything's fine, okay?
[00:57:32.218 --> 00:57:33.159]  Everything's fine.
[00:57:33.399 --> 00:57:34.779]  There's no new world order.
[00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:37.041]  The government's not carrying out terror attacks.
[00:57:37.101 --> 00:57:37.821]  Everything's fine.
[00:57:39.369 --> 00:57:41.510]  I mean, I took debate, okay?
[00:57:41.570 --> 00:57:45.311]  Don't sit there with your little handbook out, trying that stuff with me, buddy.
[00:57:45.771 --> 00:57:47.111]  It just isn't going to work, okay?
[00:57:47.131 --> 00:57:49.812]  I know you're just trying to make me get mad, and you succeeded partially.
[00:57:50.212 --> 00:57:57.153]  Before we end this hour, I want to encourage everybody to expose the murdering terrorists, because they've got their operatives out there 24-7 trying to discredit what we're doing.
[00:57:57.593 --> 00:57:58.314]  Have the facts.
[00:57:58.354 --> 00:58:02.195]  Have my three-hour film, Martial Law, which scares the globalists to death.
[00:58:02.335 --> 00:58:02.635]  Get it.
[00:58:02.735 --> 00:58:03.555]  Make a hundred copies.
[00:58:03.575 --> 00:58:04.775]  Make a copy every night of it.
[00:58:05.055 --> 00:58:08.136]  Give it to somebody every day, and in a hundred days, you would have given out a hundred copies.
[00:58:09.301 --> 00:58:10.262]  Make copies of it.
[00:58:10.302 --> 00:58:10.702]  Get it out.
[00:58:10.742 --> 00:58:12.043]  Go to prisonplanet.tv.
[00:58:12.363 --> 00:58:13.284]  Download copies.
[00:58:13.324 --> 00:58:14.145]  Burn copies there.
[00:58:14.185 --> 00:58:16.266]  Fifteen cents a day for a membership.
[00:58:16.286 --> 00:58:21.730]  We're now offering year memberships over five months free when you sign up just this month.
[00:58:22.170 --> 00:58:23.651]  Prisonplanet.tv.
[00:58:23.932 --> 00:58:28.855]  Or go to infowars.com to order hard copies of the DVDs, VHS, you name it.
[00:58:29.175 --> 00:58:34.319]  In fact, just because of that guy, everybody, I want you to call right now and order more martial laws and get them out.
[00:58:34.559 --> 00:58:37.261]  We've got to expose this before the next balloon goes up.
[00:58:37.501 --> 00:58:38.162]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:41.613 --> 00:58:42.194]  We're good to go.
[00:58:57.777 --> 00:58:58.437]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.077 --> 00:59:00.157]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.858 --> 00:59:01.958]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.618 --> 00:59:03.438]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.178 --> 00:59:05.178]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.758 --> 00:59:09.699]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.939 --> 00:59:14.060]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:26.762]  Now into the second hour of this live Thursday.
[00:59:27.632 --> 00:59:30.214]  March 2nd, 2006 edition.
[00:59:31.575 --> 00:59:32.796]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:59:32.856 --> 00:59:34.497]  Wide open phones, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:34.517 --> 00:59:49.769]  I want to get more into how one in a thousand Americans know what the First Amendment is, but the majority of Americans know about the American Idol judges and their names and popular advertising slogans.
[00:59:50.447 --> 00:59:57.731]  Then we get into the Department of Education's own documents, Rockefeller Foundation's own documents, where they talk about how it's all to dumb you down and how you're a bunch of slaves.
[00:59:59.072 --> 01:00:01.753]  Their own documents, it's incontrovertible, you cannot debate it.
[01:00:02.133 --> 01:00:05.776]  Also more on former Soviet dissident warrants of EU socialist dictatorship.
[01:00:06.876 --> 01:00:07.777]  More on the torture.
[01:00:08.277 --> 01:00:10.898]  There is so much coming up in this hour.
[01:00:11.459 --> 01:00:14.260]  Right now, let's go back to the calls.
[01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:18.042]  Mike in Missouri, then Charles, Cindy, Evan, and others.
[01:00:18.082 --> 01:00:19.163]  Go ahead, Michael.
[01:00:19.727 --> 01:00:20.688]  Hey, good afternoon, Alex.
[01:00:20.928 --> 01:00:21.208]  Hi.
[01:00:21.748 --> 01:00:33.776]  You've got a lot of supporters in northern Arkansas and southeast Missouri, and over in southern Illinois, I'd like to thank Dale Atkins at WI&I in Murfreesboro at 1420 AM, carrying the third hour over there.
[01:00:33.836 --> 01:00:34.977]  Yeah, another great affiliate.
[01:00:35.357 --> 01:00:36.278]  They are good people.
[01:00:36.338 --> 01:00:37.618]  I've known Dale for years.
[01:00:38.979 --> 01:00:42.602]  I tell you, as we speak, I'm making copies of your movies.
[01:00:42.642 --> 01:00:44.763]  Some I've purchased directly, some are copies.
[01:00:45.567 --> 01:00:53.890]  And I'm making copies for the gun show this weekend down in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, at the Black River Coliseum, also the 17th here in Cape Girardeau at the Show Me Center.
[01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:55.010]  I'm giving them away.
[01:00:55.070 --> 01:00:57.271]  I'm giving away your interviews that I've downloaded.
[01:00:57.991 --> 01:00:59.371]  I'm giving away tapes.
[01:00:59.431 --> 01:01:02.112]  I'm not asking anything for my material.
[01:01:02.252 --> 01:01:02.412]  Good.
[01:01:02.452 --> 01:01:04.653]  I'm glad you're getting the word out, sir.
[01:01:05.033 --> 01:01:08.934]  Well, I tell you, people in Poplar Bluff, they've been trying to get KLID there at 1340 a.m.
[01:01:08.954 --> 01:01:09.214]  sunny to...
[01:01:11.434 --> 01:01:11.975]  We're good to go.
[01:01:21.242 --> 01:01:30.026]  Organizing armed groups of citizens, having grant money for armed groups of citizens, that was shortly after... Yes, that was done under the Model States of Emergency Powers Act.
[01:01:30.106 --> 01:01:41.790]  Special little minions of sheriff's departments and police departments to help carry out forced inoculations because they couldn't get enough of the cops to take the shot or sign on to it.
[01:01:42.491 --> 01:01:44.011]  But that all fell through and failed.
[01:01:44.551 --> 01:01:45.972]  Well, I hope so because...
[01:01:46.428 --> 01:01:48.370]  I was called shortly after September 11th.
[01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:50.992]  I helped form the Marine Corps League here in Cape Girardeau.
[01:01:51.353 --> 01:01:52.133]  I was an officer.
[01:01:52.194 --> 01:01:56.097]  I was called by an officer one weekend, and he asked me if I'd be interested in joining.
[01:01:56.117 --> 01:01:59.480]  He said there was grant money from FEMA, and he was thinking about applying for a grant.
[01:01:59.861 --> 01:02:03.704]  Would I be interested in joining, get an M-16, you know, uniform, that kind of thing?
[01:02:03.965 --> 01:02:08.629]  And I said, well, I'll tell you, and this was after I was, if you remember, that Army National Guard captain up in Detroit.
[01:02:09.031 --> 01:02:14.635]  In the Detroit Free Press, he said if the little mama, grandma didn't take her shot, he would shoot her.
[01:02:14.835 --> 01:02:17.297]  Yeah, he said if she doesn't take her shot, we'll kill your grandmother.
[01:02:17.397 --> 01:02:28.224]  Yeah, so I was well aware of this, and I said, well, I'll tell you what, you know, I'd love to join something like this if we're going to support the Constitution, be loyal to our oath that I took in 1966 as a Marine before I went to Vietnam.
[01:02:28.244 --> 01:02:33.467]  If we're going to support the Constitution and the citizens of the United States... Oh, it'd be great, yeah, we need...
[01:02:35.437 --> 01:02:45.161]  And I said, on the other hand, if we're going to be like this Army Captain and do whatever we're told by FEMA or the President or whatever, I said, I don't want any part of it.
[01:02:45.201 --> 01:02:47.943]  In fact, I may have to consider my other options.
[01:02:48.643 --> 01:02:49.743]  And I never got a call back.
[01:02:49.783 --> 01:02:52.084]  I don't know if they formed a group here or not.
[01:02:53.005 --> 01:02:55.686]  I went to the Marine Corps League a couple of times later.
[01:02:55.726 --> 01:03:02.349]  I know that, by and large, it failed because, by and large, our military men are incredible patriots who aren't idiots.
[01:03:02.929 --> 01:03:03.850]  I think that's right.
[01:03:05.895 --> 01:03:08.438]  They probably called 100 people and probably found five.
[01:03:08.458 --> 01:03:12.203]  I mean, you're not going to find real warriors who, on average, will do this.
[01:03:12.504 --> 01:03:15.187]  That's why the globalists use criminals, sir, or foreigners.
[01:03:15.908 --> 01:03:19.052]  Well, yesterday in the barbershop, I ran into a former Marine.
[01:03:19.192 --> 01:03:20.494]  He thinks the same way I do.
[01:03:20.714 --> 01:03:22.036]  There's a lot of people out here.
[01:03:22.509 --> 01:03:23.650]  You know, they've got questions.
[01:03:23.710 --> 01:03:26.572]  And now, Alex, I've got... Oh, you're going into the... Well, stay there.
[01:03:26.592 --> 01:03:27.893]  I want you to recap.
[01:03:27.933 --> 01:03:29.415]  Some stations don't carry this segment.
[01:03:29.435 --> 01:03:31.676]  I want you to recap the phone call you got.
[01:03:31.977 --> 01:03:42.105]  Yeah, they were trying to hire former military, other people, friends of the police department that had military training, prominent people to carry out suicide missions for them, basically.
[01:03:42.505 --> 01:03:43.126]  And that's what it is.
[01:03:43.206 --> 01:03:46.208]  Gun confiscation, forced inoculations, a suicide mission.
[01:03:46.228 --> 01:03:48.049]  You might as well go jump off a cliff.
[01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:49.090]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:49.130 --> 01:03:49.491]  Stay with us.
[01:03:50.011 --> 01:03:52.653]  We're good to go.
[01:04:11.724 --> 01:04:13.705]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:13.905 --> 01:04:16.745]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.825 --> 01:04:21.487]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.707 --> 01:04:26.108]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.

[01:04:53.644 --> 01:04:57.125]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:04:57.385 --> 01:05:00.887]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:05:00.987 --> 01:05:04.928]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:05:05.148 --> 01:05:11.310]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:05:11.710 --> 01:05:19.613]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:05:20.033 --> 01:05:25.377]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:05:25.537 --> 01:05:29.300]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:31.522]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:05:31.582 --> 01:05:33.744]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:05:34.004 --> 01:05:38.927]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[01:05:38.987 --> 01:05:44.532]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:05:49.276 --> 01:05:50.677]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:05:50.937 --> 01:05:51.758]  Protect your family.
[01:05:52.539 --> 01:05:58.324]  Discover a natural way to experience healthier, cleaner indoor air without expensive filters and high-maintenance machines.
[01:05:58.544 --> 01:06:01.047]  Discover what natural health professionals have known for decades.
[01:06:01.207 --> 01:06:03.829]  Natural salt lamps ionize and purify indoor air.
[01:06:03.989 --> 01:06:07.693]  Natural salt lamps come handcrafted from salt crystals that are millions of years old.
[01:06:07.793 --> 01:06:12.938]  These lamps create healthy ions that eliminate odor, reduce bacteria, and can help allergy and asthma sufferers.
[01:06:13.078 --> 01:06:13.518]  We're good to go.
[01:06:35.794 --> 01:06:36.354]  We're good to go.
[01:07:05.993 --> 01:07:06.654]  We're good to go.
[01:07:23.341 --> 01:07:38.395]  Watching 10, 15, sometimes 20 other news cameras, and they'll give a press conference, we're training for Iraq, we're training for Serbia, we're training for overseas, and then you can go videotape their actual training, and they're training for America, and then you can ask the colonel, Colonel Love in one case, and he says, yeah, it's for America.
[01:07:39.315 --> 01:07:43.939]  And they gave the Marines the questionnaires, will you fire on Americans?
[01:07:43.959 --> 01:07:47.583]  76%, one of the famous ones, 29 Palms, said they wouldn't.
[01:07:47.963 --> 01:07:49.985]  24% said they would, either idiots or traitors.
[01:07:50.703 --> 01:07:55.150]  But, and they've given some questionnaires to police, and they've gotten the same kind of answers.
[01:07:55.530 --> 01:07:57.473]  Because at least Americans still remember that.
[01:07:57.493 --> 01:08:00.617]  I mean, people who go wrong in government most of the time just are ignorant.
[01:08:00.637 --> 01:08:02.340]  But high up, it's extremely evil.
[01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:03.722]  We were just talking to a gentleman...
[01:08:04.466 --> 01:08:04.946]  We're good to go.
[01:08:26.338 --> 01:08:35.166]  Firefighters, EMS, nurses, government officials, different auxiliary groups, volunteer firemen to take it.
[01:08:35.666 --> 01:08:49.698]  And the LA Times reported that 99 plus percent, only a few thousand out of the millions, agreed to do it because they even had top doctors on the news going, well this stuff is deadly poison, won't even protect you from weaponized smallpox, what's the point?
[01:08:50.350 --> 01:08:51.471]  It's like the anthrax shot.
[01:08:51.491 --> 01:08:56.616]  It covers you for seven spores, and a Russian-brewed anthrax has over 150 spores.
[01:08:56.816 --> 01:08:58.137]  The U.S.
[01:08:58.177 --> 01:09:02.481]  has over 300 different types of spore sizes and anthrax varieties.
[01:09:02.501 --> 01:09:04.904]  That's why it's called weaponized, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:07.812 --> 01:09:13.237]  It was all really a smokescreen in the name of dealing with a bio-attack to really federalize local communities.
[01:09:13.297 --> 01:09:28.573]  And then when the police wouldn't do it, and the firemen wouldn't do it, they tried to get citizen groups just around the police chief or the sheriff to say that they would go force citizens in the local sports arenas for the shots and even told them, you don't even have to take it.
[01:09:29.253 --> 01:09:31.735]  And the last time I checked, it had fallen apart.
[01:09:32.255 --> 01:09:34.256]  So much of what they're doing is falling apart.
[01:09:34.296 --> 01:09:35.617]  The EU just fell apart.
[01:09:36.078 --> 01:09:38.399]  The Pan-American Union just fell apart last year.
[01:09:38.799 --> 01:09:40.440]  Lots of good stuff's happening.
[01:09:40.961 --> 01:09:51.968]  But this gentleman called in and mentioned, that was right at the time, in 2002, when the Detroit Free Press had an Army captain quoted saying, we're trained to kill old ladies if they refuse quarantine and inoculation.
[01:09:52.008 --> 01:09:53.609]  We will, quote, shoot grandma.
[01:09:53.989 --> 01:09:55.010]  So he got a call.
[01:09:55.971 --> 01:10:03.658]  And tell folks about that call and tell folks what area you're in and the local Marine Corps group you head up and how they try to recruit you for those that missed it.
[01:10:05.019 --> 01:10:09.963]  Alex, I'm in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and I helped found the Marine Corps League here a couple of years ago.
[01:10:10.624 --> 01:10:16.969]  And shortly after September 11th, I got a call from a man who was going to become the commandant behind one of the chief officers.
[01:10:17.029 --> 01:10:18.250]  I was an officer as well.
[01:10:18.911 --> 01:10:19.932]  And it was on the weekend.
[01:10:19.952 --> 01:10:22.074]  He asked me if I would be interested in joining a group.
[01:10:22.154 --> 01:10:22.534]  He said yes.
[01:10:23.530 --> 01:10:28.273]  FEMA had grant money, and they still had some grant money, and he was going to make an application for it.
[01:10:28.713 --> 01:10:33.455]  The group would be armed with M16 military weapons and a uniform.
[01:10:34.115 --> 01:10:39.218]  And I said, well, sure, I'd be interested in joining, but I want to know something.
[01:10:39.298 --> 01:10:50.323]  Is this group going to defend the Constitution of the United States and uphold the citizens, or are we just going to do whatever FEMA says or what the president, whoever that happens to be at the time, says?
[01:10:51.030 --> 01:11:04.818]  I said, if that's the case, and I told him about the Army Captain in Detroit, and I said, if that's going to be the case, then I'm afraid I would be on, you know, I'd have to look at my other options, which meant I may be on another side than what he was.
[01:11:04.858 --> 01:11:09.660]  I would not force little old ladies to take shots or shoot them and something like that.
[01:11:09.881 --> 01:11:11.021]  I never got a call back.
[01:11:11.201 --> 01:11:14.223]  I do not know if the group was formed, but I was called.
[01:11:15.102 --> 01:11:18.727]  By the officer and asked if I wanted to join that organization.
[01:11:18.747 --> 01:11:30.445]  Now, I've got a comment on this, because those particular programs you're mentioning, I believe, predominantly fail, but two others I can think of have gone on, at least to a certain extent, and succeeded.
[01:11:30.905 --> 01:11:32.706]  And I want to tell people about those in a moment.
[01:11:32.726 --> 01:11:37.067]  We have video and news and photo documentation actually in the new film, Martial Law.
[01:11:37.367 --> 01:11:38.588]  And I'll point people towards that.
[01:11:38.608 --> 01:11:42.889]  We even had a guest on from Tennessee who heads up one of the groups just two months ago.
[01:11:42.909 --> 01:11:48.511]  I don't know if you heard that interview, but you were going to ask a second question or make a second statement when we went to break.
[01:11:48.891 --> 01:11:49.111]  Right.
[01:11:49.291 --> 01:11:51.292]  Alex, just two things.
[01:11:51.492 --> 01:11:58.054]  One, here in the state of Missouri, most of our Missouri National Guard units are engineers or transportation engineers.
[01:11:58.804 --> 01:12:04.186]  There is going to be conversion of many of these units over to military police.
[01:12:04.526 --> 01:12:05.687]  That's on their website.
[01:12:06.007 --> 01:12:14.690]  I got a call from a friend of mine who knows the commanding general, General Sidwell, here in the state of Missouri, and he informed me, and I sent an email to General Sidwell.
[01:12:14.730 --> 01:12:15.770]  I've not received an reply.
[01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:16.690]  It's been over a month.
[01:12:17.091 --> 01:12:17.951]  Asking him again.
[01:12:18.567 --> 01:12:30.670]  If these units that were converting the military police, if they were going to defend the Constitution of the state of Missouri and the United States and uphold the citizens, or if they were going to blindly do whatever came down from the executive.
[01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:33.551]  Well, you just stole my thunder.
[01:12:33.651 --> 01:12:34.391]  I'm sorry.
[01:12:34.811 --> 01:12:38.232]  That's where they've succeeded, and you want to get the answer now or get it off air?
[01:12:38.732 --> 01:12:39.992]  Okay, either one.
[01:12:40.072 --> 01:12:40.973]  And one quick thing.
[01:12:41.133 --> 01:12:41.913]  I have an analogy.
[01:12:42.775 --> 01:12:52.122]  I'm going to be at the Bomber Bluff Gun Show this weekend at the Black River Coliseum, and later on the 17th here in Cape Girardeau at the Show Me Center, giving away your movies, your interviews.
[01:12:52.863 --> 01:13:04.452]  Also, the American Free Press has given me copies of their newspaper to give away, and I'm going to order bumper stickers, InfoWars.com bumper stickers from you here in a moment, and I'm going to sign up for Planet TV.
[01:13:06.852 --> 01:13:20.676]  Well, I'm on a dial-up, and so I've not done it until now, but you've got a sweet offer that I want you to tell us about here in a little bit.
[01:13:20.716 --> 01:13:21.696]  I heard about it yesterday.
[01:13:22.196 --> 01:13:27.198]  Alex, my analogy is, if we were... Okay, and this is for anybody.
[01:13:27.298 --> 01:13:34.780]  If you went home tonight, and everybody in your home had been brutally murdered, I mean, tortured, murdered, mutilated, and the police were there, they removed the bodies...
[01:13:35.356 --> 01:13:42.940]  Would you get out your garden hose, spray the blood off your welcome mat, toss it out on the front porch, open your front door, your back door, and your windows, and go on to sleep?
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:45.501]  Almost invariably, everybody says, well, no.
[01:13:45.721 --> 01:13:46.942]  Now, that's what's happened to our country.
[01:13:46.962 --> 01:13:47.663]  That's right.
[01:13:48.083 --> 01:13:56.067]  And then I said, well, later the police come back because they want to ask you a follow-up question, and there you are in bed calmly asleep with your windows and doors open.
[01:13:56.167 --> 01:13:58.548]  Who do you think is going to go to the top of their suspect list?
[01:13:59.529 --> 01:13:59.849]  You are.
[01:14:00.925 --> 01:14:01.546]  And that's what happened.
[01:14:01.566 --> 01:14:04.148]  We got attacked on 9-11, but the border's more open than ever.
[01:14:04.228 --> 01:14:05.249]  I appreciate it.
[01:14:05.269 --> 01:14:06.110]  That's right, Alex.
[01:14:06.351 --> 01:14:10.415]  And I don't care if it's Arabs, communists, Chinese that Bill Clinton did.
[01:14:11.916 --> 01:14:16.060]  If we had a real attack by real terrorists, our borders would not be open.
[01:14:16.341 --> 01:14:19.484]  And if we had a real attack by real terrorists on September 11th,
[01:14:20.123 --> 01:14:29.990]  We would not consider in the wildest imagination having any foreign involvement in the operation of something so... No, I hear you, and I want to answer your second question, so I'm going to let you go.
[01:14:30.010 --> 01:14:37.015]  But before you go, quickly, most of the former Marines I talk to are awake now, or they're total idiot neocons, or it's the two camps.
[01:14:37.655 --> 01:14:41.918]  You know, you are saying that you're pretty high up there in the local retiree Marine Corps community.
[01:14:41.938 --> 01:14:44.900]  What are they saying when you guys talk about this stuff to them?
[01:14:45.379 --> 01:14:49.082]  Well, Alex, to tell you the truth, I've dropped out.
[01:14:49.102 --> 01:14:52.665]  I've not attended regular meetings because I got very upset.
[01:14:52.705 --> 01:15:04.936]  It was right after the initial attack on Iraq, and most of my fellow Marines at that time were saying things like, turn it into a parking lot, nuke them and turn it into a sheet of glass, that kind of thing.
[01:15:05.356 --> 01:15:07.258]  And that was just a few.
[01:15:07.398 --> 01:15:08.279]  Others wouldn't comment.
[01:15:08.299 --> 01:15:10.881]  They may have felt like I did, but they didn't comment.
[01:15:11.266 --> 01:15:18.032]  And I didn't want a lot of conflict in the organization and look like a big dummy, so I've been talking to other individuals.
[01:15:18.372 --> 01:15:20.594]  Law enforcement here is receptive.
[01:15:20.895 --> 01:15:24.678]  I've talked to several police and other individuals.
[01:15:25.298 --> 01:15:29.682]  I've passed on your movies, and now that's why I want to go to Poplar Bluff this weekend at the Black River College.
[01:15:29.702 --> 01:15:32.305]  But you said just the other day you were in a barber shop talking to a Marine.
[01:15:32.465 --> 01:15:33.286]  Oh, yeah, yesterday.
[01:15:33.786 --> 01:15:38.270]  Yesterday, a former Marine came in, a gentleman about my age, Vietnam era,
[01:15:38.852 --> 01:15:53.661]  And he was very up on all these issues, you know, and I told him about your website and everything, and I've made up a little pamphlet that I'm going to hand out, too, with you and Gary and a couple other people on it, and also the Prison Planet offer and everything.
[01:15:53.701 --> 01:15:54.842]  I've made it up for this weekend.
[01:15:55.142 --> 01:15:59.164]  But, yeah, there's people, you know, here in Cape Girardeau, we're kind of slow.
[01:15:59.545 --> 01:16:06.569]  Over in the West Plains area, western Missouri, you know, the Ozarks, those people are sharp, and I know down in Tennessee...
[01:16:07.197 --> 01:16:08.798]  Western Tennessee and that area.
[01:16:09.099 --> 01:16:13.642]  People are very sharp, and I think the New World Order is going to have trouble with these segments.
[01:16:14.022 --> 01:16:15.724]  Here in Cape, we're very conservative.
[01:16:15.744 --> 01:16:16.925]  We're very pro-Bush.
[01:16:17.325 --> 01:16:22.449]  You know, if you say anything, you know, Michael Savage, well, of course, Rush Limbaugh is from here.
[01:16:22.509 --> 01:16:24.390]  I know David, his brother, is a good guy.
[01:16:26.372 --> 01:16:31.996]  But anyway, you know, you have two camps, like you said, the completely dumbed-down robot
[01:16:33.553 --> 01:16:35.695]  And then you have the people who are waking up.
[01:16:35.835 --> 01:16:49.626]  And, you know, surprisingly, the barber was telling me that there's Army guys coming back from Iraq, you know, who are exhibiting sentiments like that are showing up in this Iraq survey that they just did not too long ago.
[01:16:49.706 --> 01:16:50.107]  I hear you.
[01:16:50.147 --> 01:16:51.147]  Listen, thanks for the call.
[01:16:51.488 --> 01:16:52.048]  Great call.
[01:16:52.068 --> 01:16:53.750]  And more of your calls are coming up in a lot of news.
[01:16:53.770 --> 01:16:55.191]  Let me just comment on what he said earlier.
[01:16:55.651 --> 01:17:00.215]  A lot of these paramilitary formations failed, but they took the state national guards.
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:03.541]  The state guards and the national guards, I should say.
[01:17:04.242 --> 01:17:14.508]  And a year ago, I showed a big document on the TV show that I was given by a police officer who also is in the state guard.
[01:17:15.448 --> 01:17:17.730]  And they told him, hey, no more disaster relief.
[01:17:17.890 --> 01:17:19.111]  It's gun confiscation.
[01:17:19.151 --> 01:17:20.511]  And I got the training manuals.
[01:17:20.551 --> 01:17:21.432]  I showed it on TV.
[01:17:21.792 --> 01:17:26.315]  That's in one of the prisonplanet.tv member TV shows there.
[01:17:26.635 --> 01:17:28.176]  It's up there, close-ups of the documents.
[01:17:28.989 --> 01:17:33.913]  And he's the same police officer who helped us do the ballistics test last week, or two weeks ago.
[01:17:35.654 --> 01:17:37.996]  And then they have, like, the Alabama Defense Force.
[01:17:38.416 --> 01:17:43.300]  And we show that in the Phil Marshall Law off their own website.
[01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:49.325]  And they will shut down whole cities in Alabama during a different fest.
[01:17:50.237 --> 01:17:51.738]  And, you know, different city parties.
[01:17:51.878 --> 01:17:56.941]  And it shows three-year-olds being searched, having their bags searched by men and women in camo and Humvees.
[01:17:57.001 --> 01:18:01.804]  And they'll be there with a cigarette and a hamburger in one hand with their bellies hanging out, searching everybody.
[01:18:02.144 --> 01:18:06.166]  It's just goonism, federal grant, to train everybody to accept seeing.
[01:18:06.246 --> 01:18:09.008]  It's just like all the urban warfare training drills.
[01:18:09.228 --> 01:18:14.011]  So, yes, all over the place, I talked to the state national guardman.
[01:18:14.031 --> 01:18:15.252]  It was just part-time.
[01:18:15.272 --> 01:18:17.253]  He's a police officer as well.
[01:18:18.013 --> 01:18:19.114]  And I was talking to him.
[01:18:20.043 --> 01:18:21.324]  And he said he'd go to these meetings.
[01:18:21.364 --> 01:18:25.387]  They'd all be in these base meeting halls.
[01:18:25.467 --> 01:18:27.529]  And openly, no, we've got to defend America.
[01:18:27.549 --> 01:18:28.490]  The terrorists are going to hit.
[01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:29.891]  The hippies just don't get it.
[01:18:29.911 --> 01:18:30.792]  We're going to have to arrest them.
[01:18:30.812 --> 01:18:31.372]  We're ready now.
[01:18:31.412 --> 01:18:31.712]  Cut it.
[01:18:32.373 --> 01:18:36.416]  And it's just they have, some of them have no conception of reality.
[01:18:36.436 --> 01:18:40.079]  And he's sitting there watching all this in horror because he's aware of what's going on.
[01:18:41.710 --> 01:18:43.591]  And, yeah, I mean, it's an attempted brown shirt.
[01:18:43.791 --> 01:18:44.952]  It's not going to work, okay?
[01:18:45.432 --> 01:18:50.234]  Most of the soldiers, 70 plus percent, know exactly what's going on.
[01:18:50.254 --> 01:18:50.895]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:55.957 --> 01:18:57.638]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:58.198 --> 01:18:59.959]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:01.127 --> 01:19:09.014]  The best kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:09.234 --> 01:19:11.876]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with BlazeMed, Inc.'
[01:19:11.856 --> 01:19:13.257]  's patented methodology.
[01:19:13.437 --> 01:19:20.363]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy tumors of any size without adverse side effects.
[01:19:20.623 --> 01:19:23.626]  At a physician's office, Star Wars technology at its best.
[01:19:23.966 --> 01:19:24.447]  We're good to go.
[01:19:24.507 --> 01:19:24.787]  I think?
[01:19:59.147 --> 01:20:02.389]  Currency devaluation, inflation, one and the same.
[01:20:03.130 --> 01:20:07.113]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:20:13.382 --> 01:20:14.142]  We're good to go.
[01:20:14.162 --> 01:20:14.322]  I think?
[01:20:37.290 --> 01:20:37.731]  We're good to go.
[01:20:53.723 --> 01:20:55.344]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:20:55.484 --> 01:20:59.586]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:20:59.726 --> 01:21:02.608]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?

[01:21:09.571 --> 01:21:10.532]  We're good to go.

[01:22:49.701 --> 01:22:51.382]  All right, here's the deal.
[01:22:51.542 --> 01:23:07.494]  I want to get into new torture news, new information on reports coming up in the next segment, but I want to get through some of the callers that have been holding the longest, and we'll go back into calls.
[01:23:07.954 --> 01:23:08.995]  Charles, Louisiana.
[01:23:09.035 --> 01:23:10.276]  Charles, what's on your mind, my friend?
[01:23:10.296 --> 01:23:12.497]  I'm sorry to call in twice, Mr. Jones.
[01:23:12.537 --> 01:23:13.378]  I don't usually do that.
[01:23:13.874 --> 01:23:15.515]  You mean twice in a week?
[01:23:15.555 --> 01:23:16.176]  You're welcome to.
[01:23:16.196 --> 01:23:16.776]  What's on your mind?
[01:23:17.757 --> 01:23:26.623]  On the news, they got where George Bush in the Department of Homeland Security was warned about the levees breaking.
[01:23:26.663 --> 01:23:28.304]  They said they were told George Bush...
[01:23:28.942 --> 01:23:30.703]  There will be many, many deaths there.
[01:23:30.723 --> 01:23:36.205]  Yeah, that new tape from that AP conference call is out, but we already have the documents.
[01:23:36.225 --> 01:23:38.566]  FEMA jammed the police communications.
[01:23:38.706 --> 01:23:39.266]  Yes, yes.
[01:23:39.286 --> 01:23:42.528]  They wanted to have a disaster, then they blocked food in April five days to create a crisis.
[01:23:42.548 --> 01:23:49.671]  I talked to police down there on Howard Lee's... I gave tapes down there on Howard Lee's troopers down there, police.
[01:23:50.071 --> 01:23:57.954]  And another thing is, I don't want to mention no names, but I got four phone calls this morning, one by a retired policeman on another program they're saying...
[01:23:58.582 --> 01:24:07.209]  On a defense, Department of Defense said this month they're supposed to go into Marshall or some cities or all the cities.
[01:24:07.269 --> 01:24:07.809]  I'm not sure.
[01:24:07.829 --> 01:24:08.590]  I didn't get it yet.
[01:24:08.610 --> 01:24:10.111]  I'm checking on it.
[01:24:10.431 --> 01:24:12.012]  They're going to shut it down.
[01:24:12.372 --> 01:24:14.574]  George Bush's got a lot of heat on him right now.
[01:24:15.495 --> 01:24:18.377]  And he's got to do something because they are mad here in Louisiana.
[01:24:18.397 --> 01:24:19.178]  They're really mad.
[01:24:19.198 --> 01:24:21.499]  They're really upset about this tape out.
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:23.060]  They're really all upset.
[01:24:23.541 --> 01:24:25.102]  I've been getting phone calls all morning.
[01:24:25.620 --> 01:24:31.443]  And another thing, what happened to this $85 million, I think it's $85 million, that George Bush Sr.
[01:24:32.043 --> 01:24:34.604]  and Clinton collected for the storm?
[01:24:34.664 --> 01:24:35.804]  Nobody has got nothing.
[01:24:36.085 --> 01:24:38.466]  Sir, the UN's given almost none of the money they got.
[01:24:38.486 --> 01:24:39.286]  They're a bunch of crooks.
[01:24:39.686 --> 01:24:40.026]  Yes, sir.
[01:24:40.366 --> 01:24:44.868]  Well, do you think that it's possible that this month here they won't shut the United States down?
[01:24:46.129 --> 01:24:52.271]  Well, they've been saying for six months that they were going in in late March to strike on Iran on Election Day, what is it, the 27th or 28th in Israel?
[01:24:54.664 --> 01:24:55.165]  Look, I don't know.
[01:24:55.205 --> 01:24:58.667]  They said they were going to go into Iraq in 2002 of March.
[01:24:58.707 --> 01:24:59.608]  They went in 2003.
[01:25:00.068 --> 01:25:01.189]  So I don't know, sir.
[01:25:01.709 --> 01:25:03.350]  I mean, certainly the preparations have been made.
[01:25:03.370 --> 01:25:06.512]  I don't think they're far enough along to be able to do that.
[01:25:06.572 --> 01:25:07.673]  I mean, they're having a lot of trouble.
[01:25:07.733 --> 01:25:10.595]  I hear some pessimists on the radio saying we've lost, there's nothing we can do.
[01:25:10.615 --> 01:25:12.796]  And, you know, I disagree with that.
[01:25:12.836 --> 01:25:15.598]  I mean, we have never seen more people waking up than they are now.
[01:25:15.618 --> 01:25:20.301]  A policeman told me, two of them told me yesterday after the show, I just was kind of discouraged and went...
[01:25:20.734 --> 01:25:22.377]  Had some coffee, took a motorcycle.
[01:25:22.398 --> 01:25:25.724]  Police said they're going to have a lot of trouble out of the Bayou people.
[01:25:26.285 --> 01:25:29.332]  The Bayou people have woke up, and they're going to be in a lot of trouble.
[01:25:29.352 --> 01:25:30.173]  They're not going for this.
[01:25:30.193 --> 01:25:31.175]  The police are sick of this.
[01:25:32.168 --> 01:25:33.690]  The police themselves are sick of this.
[01:25:33.710 --> 01:25:34.250]  Well, I know.
[01:25:34.370 --> 01:25:34.571]  I know.
[01:25:34.611 --> 01:25:36.773]  You can fool people for a while, and you can't fool them forever.
[01:25:36.973 --> 01:25:41.318]  Because any real cop deep down loves his family more than he loves this sick government.
[01:25:41.578 --> 01:25:41.758]  Yes.
[01:25:42.098 --> 01:25:43.200]  I mean, choose police.
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:46.123]  Choose your family in America versus a bunch of crooks.
[01:25:46.403 --> 01:25:47.064]  And then they know.
[01:25:47.204 --> 01:25:50.787]  I said, when you're out there trying to arrest people, who's going to protect your family?
[01:25:51.048 --> 01:25:51.628]  And then they're going to...
[01:25:53.991 --> 01:26:02.879]  They'll never disarm him.
[01:26:03.319 --> 01:26:05.661]  They'll never disarm this police force down here.
[01:26:06.102 --> 01:26:07.023]  They'll never do it.
[01:26:07.383 --> 01:26:13.209]  And they said if they try to disarm where I'm at, in the Bayou countries, they're going to have a lot of trouble.
[01:26:13.229 --> 01:26:14.630]  They're going to have to kill a lot of people.
[01:26:15.987 --> 01:26:16.708]  People are mad.
[01:26:16.788 --> 01:26:18.069]  I mean, today they are mad.
[01:26:18.870 --> 01:26:22.493]  New Orleans, you know, they're living in boxes down here.
[01:26:22.673 --> 01:26:23.594]  They've got no money.
[01:26:23.634 --> 01:26:27.898]  You ought to see, Mr. Jones, you would have to see the devastation yourself.
[01:26:28.138 --> 01:26:29.979]  I know, and the money's not getting to the people.
[01:26:29.999 --> 01:26:30.760]  Thanks for the call.
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:32.121]  I hear you, Charles.
[01:26:32.221 --> 01:26:32.782]  I understand.
[01:26:33.983 --> 01:26:36.065]  Cindy in Delaware, go ahead.
[01:26:36.085 --> 01:26:39.047]  Hey, Alex, you are our national treasure.
[01:26:39.087 --> 01:26:40.128]  I hope you realize that.
[01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:42.951]  Well, if I'm a treasure, we're in trouble, but thank you.
[01:26:43.524 --> 01:26:45.646]  No, no, you're doing the right thing here.
[01:26:45.906 --> 01:27:00.158]  Listen, I called in the C-SPAN today because they had a guy there from the American Enterprise Institute, one of their PR guys, saying, you know, how not to worry about the port deal and we can't be bashing the Arabs, yada yada, racism, all that kind of stuff.
[01:27:00.723 --> 01:27:10.773]  And, you know, this man did not want to answer another caller's question about what else of our infrastructure are you guys leasing out and outsourcing?
[01:27:10.813 --> 01:27:12.455]  He totally bypassed that.
[01:27:12.795 --> 01:27:21.063]  So I called up, and I was saying pretty much what you say on your radio show about all the different things that they're leasing to other countries.
[01:27:21.944 --> 01:27:22.064]  And...
[01:27:22.938 --> 01:27:28.934]  I told the guy on C-SPAN that he needs to get Alex Jones on there so that he can explain what's really going on here.
[01:27:29.235 --> 01:27:30.639]  I just wanted to pass that on to you.
[01:27:31.932 --> 01:27:34.373]  I don't know, maybe some of the other people listening to your station.
[01:27:34.393 --> 01:27:40.496]  Brian Lamb admits, well, you're sweet to do that, Cindy, but Brian Lamb admits, the guy that heads it up, they've gotten thousands of calls.
[01:27:40.936 --> 01:27:44.898]  They've done multiple hit pieces on me with guests on there for an hour and a half attacking me.
[01:27:45.298 --> 01:27:46.619]  And they will not give me equal time.
[01:27:46.639 --> 01:27:47.899]  They will not let me respond.
[01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:49.060]  But they're losing.
[01:27:49.100 --> 01:27:49.740]  It doesn't matter.
[01:27:49.780 --> 01:27:50.661]  You're calling in.
[01:27:51.301 --> 01:27:52.282]  I don't need to be on there.
[01:27:53.602 --> 01:27:55.143]  Just start calling in every day.
[01:27:55.783 --> 01:28:06.317]  And I hope you rattled off the fact that Jeb Bush has gotten tens of millions, Bush has gotten tens of millions, Carlaw Group's gotten $8 billion from this very company and that nation as well.
[01:28:06.638 --> 01:28:08.480]  I mentioned about Neil Bush.
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:10.583]  You know, the thing with Neil Bush?
[01:28:10.603 --> 01:28:11.564]  They're all getting money.
[01:28:11.645 --> 01:28:11.885]  I know.
[01:28:12.085 --> 01:28:12.505]  All of them.
[01:28:12.705 --> 01:28:14.666]  It's a new child left behind, too.
[01:28:14.706 --> 01:28:18.788]  He's getting money from the Arabs and from the president's new child left behind him.
[01:28:18.828 --> 01:28:20.129]  Listen, it's a federal law.
[01:28:20.149 --> 01:28:26.692]  There's a 45-day national security review waived by Treasury Secretary Snow, who sat on the board that okayed the deal.
[01:28:26.952 --> 01:28:28.013]  That's illegal right there.
[01:28:28.353 --> 01:28:35.277]  Now the number two man at the UAE Dubai ports world is going to be the man running the Maritime Administration, all security in the U.S.
[01:28:35.637 --> 01:28:39.299]  So when Limbaugh gets up there and says they're not running security, it's an absolute lie.
[01:28:39.319 --> 01:28:40.019]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.965 --> 01:28:44.866]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.346 --> 01:28:46.947]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.967 --> 01:28:50.649]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.192 --> 01:28:57.854]  Is your quality of life reduced because of health problems?
[01:28:58.074 --> 01:28:59.875]  Are you starting to feel the signs of aging?
[01:29:00.035 --> 01:29:04.058]  Are you relatively healthy but wonder if you can do more to maintain proper health?
[01:29:04.258 --> 01:29:05.639]  Now there's Stem Enhance.
[01:29:06.019 --> 01:29:10.602]  Stem Enhance is a new product category of phytonutrients that help in renewing your body.
[01:29:10.862 --> 01:29:16.663]  Stem Enhance's natural ingredients help to support the release of stem cells from your bone marrow into your bloodstream.
[01:29:16.863 --> 01:29:28.306]  Through a natural process, those stem cells have the amazing ability to transform into any type of cell in the body, like heart cells, brain cells, liver cells, can all be generated from this powerful building block.
[01:29:28.566 --> 01:29:38.068]  Thousands of people who use Stem Enhance have reported spectacular results, experiencing everything from an increase in energy in just a few days to an improvement in overall health.
[01:29:38.408 --> 01:29:43.792]  Not available in stores, STEM Enhanced is available by contacting Dr. Patricia Margaitis at 860-567-7744.
[01:29:43.852 --> 01:29:44.032]  That's 860-567-7744.
[01:29:53.439 --> 01:30:01.686]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:01.946 --> 01:30:06.309]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:06.610 --> 01:30:15.517]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:30:15.717 --> 01:30:19.340]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:24.649]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:24.949 --> 01:30:31.701]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:30:32.182 --> 01:30:32.722]  What about you?
[01:30:33.465 --> 01:30:38.808]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[01:30:38.868 --> 01:30:40.028]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:30:40.048 --> 01:30:41.929]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:30:53.214 --> 01:30:57.659]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[01:30:57.939 --> 01:31:01.543]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[01:31:01.683 --> 01:31:09.772]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[01:31:10.052 --> 01:31:15.694]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[01:31:15.995 --> 01:31:21.237]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[01:31:21.497 --> 01:31:23.598]  This is why you need the filter mag.
[01:31:23.838 --> 01:31:35.983]  The filter mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[01:31:36.223 --> 01:31:40.647]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[01:31:40.868 --> 01:31:41.808]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:31:41.989 --> 01:31:43.610]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[01:31:43.750 --> 01:31:45.532]  That's FilterMag.com.
[01:31:45.812 --> 01:31:46.273]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[01:31:46.313 --> 01:31:46.493]  That's 800-345-8376.
[01:32:13.788 --> 01:32:22.332]  The calls are all excellent.
[01:32:22.572 --> 01:32:25.193]  I'll keep you on 5 to 15 minutes apiece.
[01:32:25.593 --> 01:32:27.354]  I've got to move quicker so everybody can get on.
[01:32:27.374 --> 01:32:28.995]  I'm going to take five calls right now.
[01:32:29.830 --> 01:32:30.751]  As fast as I can.
[01:32:30.771 --> 01:32:31.872]  I'm going to get back in the news.
[01:32:31.912 --> 01:32:33.954]  And Ron Paul's floating next hour.
[01:32:33.994 --> 01:32:37.557]  He's in a meeting with a general right now with his liberty committee.
[01:32:38.177 --> 01:32:39.278]  And they had to move it back.
[01:32:39.358 --> 01:32:41.560]  But he's set for some time the next hour.
[01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:44.863]  And 90% of the time he joins us on the day he says he will.
[01:32:44.883 --> 01:32:45.663]  But he's in D.C.
[01:32:45.703 --> 01:32:49.627]  right now in some committee meeting with the military.
[01:32:49.747 --> 01:32:51.328]  So as soon as he comes out of that meeting,
[01:32:51.653 --> 01:32:52.494]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:33:12.034 --> 01:33:13.835]  I was just, three quick points.
[01:33:14.395 --> 01:33:25.200]  I wanted to just double check on some information, like anything else I could search for besides Rex 84 and Operation Endgame to find out, like get mainstream articles about the concentration camps.
[01:33:25.220 --> 01:33:28.142]  Well, you'll just get mainstream documents from Homeland Security.
[01:33:28.886 --> 01:33:30.447]  And, yeah, I mean, I've printed them up.
[01:33:30.527 --> 01:33:31.947]  I have them right here in my stack.
[01:33:31.967 --> 01:33:38.790]  They're actually in my car because I had them on TV last night, but they're about 15 feet away from me out at the glass windows here in my car.
[01:33:38.890 --> 01:33:43.011]  But that's the synopsis of the new Homeland Security program.
[01:33:43.051 --> 01:33:44.032]  It's called Endgame.
[01:33:44.732 --> 01:33:48.634]  And we've got a bunch of articles posted about it, and it's right there.
[01:33:49.294 --> 01:33:49.574]  Okay.
[01:33:49.734 --> 01:33:55.356]  Another thing, just about, like, spreading information, like we're still doing the MySpace thing.
[01:33:55.436 --> 01:33:57.417]  Actually, I've put together a list of, like,
[01:33:58.018 --> 01:34:11.541]  Probably, like, it's every one of your videos except for Wake Up or Waco and, uh, you know, like, uh, Illuminati and the Australian Independent Media's documentary on Illuminati and, you know, just all those videos.
[01:34:11.641 --> 01:34:17.002]  There's, like, they're all streams and, uh, we passed it around in bulletins on MySpace.
[01:34:17.023 --> 01:34:20.383]  There's probably, like, 4,000 people that got those bulletins.
[01:34:20.463 --> 01:34:20.843]  I've seen them.
[01:34:20.883 --> 01:34:26.325]  I've just gone to random webpages and seen my, my, uh, my list, like, posted on their webpages.
[01:34:27.025 --> 01:34:27.465]  So, like,
[01:34:27.799 --> 01:34:29.680]  There's, I mean, it's just, it's baloney.
[01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:33.241]  And that's what you, that's what you one person did.
[01:34:33.801 --> 01:34:34.101]  Yeah.
[01:34:35.282 --> 01:34:53.088]  Um, the other thing I was going to say, I thought would be a good suggestion for you, because I know you've got so much data on your webpage, is if you took the direct links, like, I know you link, you do a good linking in the articles, but if you did, like, a reference section, and then just, uh,
[01:34:53.996 --> 01:35:01.343]  Treat it, the trees of the different subjects, and then just have the links from the actual official website.
[01:35:01.823 --> 01:35:05.967]  Yeah, we had it designed for a blog format nine, ten months ago.
[01:35:06.347 --> 01:35:10.911]  We've never switched InfoWars over to the blog format because we're so busy doing other stuff.
[01:35:10.971 --> 01:35:11.672]  It's been built.
[01:35:11.752 --> 01:35:12.192]  It's ready.
[01:35:12.232 --> 01:35:12.873]  It should be ready.
[01:35:12.893 --> 01:35:14.634]  It was supposed to be ready months ago.
[01:35:15.295 --> 01:35:16.756]  We'll be launching that in the near future.
[01:35:16.816 --> 01:35:17.457]  Thanks for the call.
[01:35:18.112 --> 01:35:19.233]  Yeah, there's a lot we need to do.
[01:35:19.253 --> 01:35:21.795]  There's a lot better job that we could do with this stuff.
[01:35:21.875 --> 01:35:24.557]  But you guys can do it, too.
[01:35:24.577 --> 01:35:28.379]  I mean, if you build good websites, if you make films, we'll carry them.
[01:35:28.419 --> 01:35:29.040]  We'll post them.
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:29.900]  We'll link to them.
[01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:32.302]  I mean, we want everybody to get attention.
[01:35:33.103 --> 01:35:34.344]  We support and promote everybody.
[01:35:34.364 --> 01:35:36.965]  We're in a fight against the New World Order together.
[01:35:37.046 --> 01:35:38.106]  We cannot do it all.
[01:35:38.166 --> 01:35:39.367]  I just hired another individual.
[01:35:39.968 --> 01:35:43.130]  So now I've got ten employees, and basically...
[01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:48.204]  I don't know, something like 90% of the money that comes in goes back into the operation.
[01:35:48.284 --> 01:35:54.069]  I keep a small amount for myself and my family because I could care less about money and status.
[01:35:54.109 --> 01:35:55.310]  It's all about the fight.
[01:35:56.511 --> 01:35:58.393]  But your support is so important.
[01:35:58.613 --> 01:36:02.536]  PrisonPlanet.tv, that pays for all of our web activities.
[01:36:02.597 --> 01:36:08.322]  It pays for the now five webmasters we have, several video editors.
[01:36:08.882 --> 01:36:10.924]  Your memberships there do that all day.
[01:36:12.181 --> 01:36:21.904]  14 of my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, my weekly TV reports from here in Austin, video interviews we do here in studio, the live radio show with documents added are going up every week.
[01:36:22.964 --> 01:36:26.886]  All of my best audio interviews, it's all there at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:36:27.846 --> 01:36:29.626]  And a lot of what we do, we put out for free.
[01:36:29.706 --> 01:36:34.988]  But the larger portion, the majority is for members only at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:36:35.508 --> 01:36:39.329]  But once you get a 15-cent-a-day membership, and that's with a monthly membership.
[01:36:40.690 --> 01:36:41.250]  But now...
[01:36:42.185 --> 01:36:46.886]  If you go to prisonplanet.tv and get a yearly membership, you get 5.3 months free.
[01:36:47.586 --> 01:36:51.307]  Okay, you get over five months free, almost half off for this month.
[01:36:51.327 --> 01:36:52.267]  We did this during December.
[01:36:52.548 --> 01:36:53.628]  We're doing it again right now.
[01:36:54.348 --> 01:36:55.608]  Take advantage of this.
[01:36:55.668 --> 01:36:57.789]  Become a prisonplanet.tv subscriber.
[01:36:57.829 --> 01:37:00.690]  And once you're there, you can download and burn a DVD.
[01:37:00.750 --> 01:37:02.130]  You can stream to VHS.
[01:37:02.170 --> 01:37:07.211]  You can stream and dump it down and download it down to just normal disk and give it to people.
[01:37:07.291 --> 01:37:10.632]  It is an unbelievably powerful activist tool.
[01:37:11.252 --> 01:37:14.554]  And you're authorized to download and make copies of all of my films.
[01:37:14.574 --> 01:37:17.596]  They're on the site in my book and Paul Watson's book in the radio show.
[01:37:17.616 --> 01:37:21.378]  Obviously, you can't do that with other films that we post about other authors and researchers.
[01:37:21.398 --> 01:37:23.519]  They just authorize us to post them on the site.
[01:37:24.359 --> 01:37:27.961]  But it's all there at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:37:28.001 --> 01:37:29.902]  Get all my films, everything, for $5.95.
[01:37:30.182 --> 01:37:36.086]  You can go there for a month, and in a month, download over 1,000 pieces of media and give it to everybody.
[01:37:36.126 --> 01:37:37.146]  That is our goal.
[01:37:37.426 --> 01:37:40.548]  That is our payment, is surviving, is living in a free country.
[01:37:40.988 --> 01:37:50.414]  I mean, I'm literally up in the middle of the night, folks, grinding my teeth, sitting there, you know, working, literally busting my guts, just putting it all out there.
[01:37:50.554 --> 01:37:52.475]  Because I realize this is total war.
[01:37:53.156 --> 01:37:53.716]  Okay?
[01:37:53.936 --> 01:37:57.759]  And we've got to have that attitude, that eye of the tiger when it comes to this fight.
[01:37:57.799 --> 01:38:00.140]  We're going to win if we lay it all out on the line.
[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:01.281]  God will bless us.
[01:38:02.432 --> 01:38:05.913]  And I know we've affected change and gotten the job done.
[01:38:05.933 --> 01:38:07.574]  And I'm tired of it.
[01:38:07.614 --> 01:38:11.915]  I know there's a lot of patriots out there that have worked hard and fought the New World Order and done the best job they can.
[01:38:12.995 --> 01:38:16.616]  And they don't see in their own personal lives the success they wish to see.
[01:38:16.676 --> 01:38:19.657]  And they think we're losing and there's nothing we can do and it's all over.
[01:38:19.937 --> 01:38:21.158]  We don't have a choice.
[01:38:21.198 --> 01:38:23.178]  Whether win, lose, or draw, we're in this fight.
[01:38:23.519 --> 01:38:24.379]  It's better to fight.
[01:38:24.439 --> 01:38:26.199]  And I see a lot of good things happening.
[01:38:26.479 --> 01:38:27.940]  And I see that we're beginning to win.
[01:38:28.540 --> 01:38:31.001]  And if you heard me six years ago, I'd say we were losing.
[01:38:31.422 --> 01:38:37.164]  I'm not being overly optimistic or a cheerleader, and frankly, I resent people saying we're losing this fight.
[01:38:37.565 --> 01:38:46.449]  And I'm not even trying to criticize those people, but I've got to tell them, suck it up, stop throwing fits, and then maybe people will rally around you.
[01:38:47.209 --> 01:38:52.292]  But if you sit there and say we're going to lose, oh boo-hoo, poor me, what do you expect is going to happen?
[01:38:52.862 --> 01:38:56.669]  Winners never quit, and quitters always quit and never win.
[01:38:57.109 --> 01:38:58.452]  Winners never quit.
[01:38:58.532 --> 01:38:59.393]  Do not quit.
[01:38:59.494 --> 01:39:00.235]  Never give up.
[01:39:00.335 --> 01:39:01.016]  Never give in.
[01:39:01.317 --> 01:39:02.138]  Never stop.
[01:39:02.258 --> 01:39:02.759]  Okay?
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:04.222]  Give me a break.
[01:39:05.416 --> 01:39:12.161]  I mean, I'm sick of this attitude that so many people have got, and the rest of them just backbiting and stabbing each other in the backs.
[01:39:12.581 --> 01:39:13.902]  We've got to stop doing that.
[01:39:13.922 --> 01:39:16.104]  We've got to stay focused on the issues.
[01:39:16.424 --> 01:39:19.966]  The issues of the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, and national sovereignty.
[01:39:20.287 --> 01:39:21.567]  That's what people tune in to hear.
[01:39:21.848 --> 01:39:23.609]  That's what people visit websites to see.
[01:39:24.069 --> 01:39:24.329]  Okay?
[01:39:24.349 --> 01:39:28.773]  And these people blow their own feet off every day, and I just feel sorry for them.
[01:39:28.893 --> 01:39:29.873]  I want more leaders.
[01:39:29.953 --> 01:39:31.995]  I want more fighters in this.
[01:39:33.893 --> 01:39:35.094]  Oh, man, that's just good advice.
[01:39:35.114 --> 01:39:37.515]  That's a friendly thing for people out there to understand.
[01:39:37.555 --> 01:39:39.397]  Let's go ahead and... I've got to hurry now.
[01:39:39.457 --> 01:39:42.338]  See, I've just... I've got to cover this news.
[01:39:43.119 --> 01:39:45.200]  Let's go ahead and talk to John.
[01:39:45.220 --> 01:39:47.041]  I believe he's in New Jersey.
[01:39:47.061 --> 01:39:47.662]  Go ahead, John.
[01:39:47.682 --> 01:39:48.482]  Hey, Alex.
[01:39:48.762 --> 01:39:50.123]  I don't know if we're winning or losing.
[01:39:50.243 --> 01:39:51.524]  I don't even know what our goals are.
[01:39:52.004 --> 01:39:56.987]  But after listening for a couple years, I would say our only goal, the only solution is anarchy.
[01:39:57.968 --> 01:40:01.390]  Don't you think we should be working towards, like, a totally voluntary society?
[01:40:02.557 --> 01:40:03.878]  Wasn't Jesus an anarchist?
[01:40:05.138 --> 01:40:06.739]  I don't think that's fair to say.
[01:40:06.819 --> 01:40:09.161]  Jesus said we should follow the Mosaic Law.
[01:40:09.181 --> 01:40:12.363]  He came to fulfill the law, not to destroy it.
[01:40:12.403 --> 01:40:16.725]  Does that mean he thinks one group of people should control another group of people?
[01:40:16.765 --> 01:40:20.827]  No, governments become a gang with a flag, with a bunch of guys with guns.
[01:40:20.947 --> 01:40:25.070]  But yes, we do need the common law system.
[01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:29.012]  Anarchy does not exist in groups of bigger than three people.
[01:40:29.552 --> 01:40:30.292]  It never has.
[01:40:30.433 --> 01:40:31.213]  It never will.
[01:40:31.233 --> 01:40:43.279]  Now, if you're talking about a limited government, highly restricted, as the Founding Fathers called for, I'm in agreement with you, but... Wasn't the Constitution just an excuse to create a system of control?
[01:40:44.199 --> 01:40:45.160]  No one voted on it.
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:46.260]  No one signed it.
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:52.243]  Well, the point is, sir, the point is it was a great improvement over all other human systems of the past.
[01:40:52.403 --> 01:40:59.425]  Instead of one man saying his opinion is law, now there's a couple, 200 people saying their opinion is law.
[01:40:59.445 --> 01:41:00.526]  No, that's not the case, sir.
[01:41:01.486 --> 01:41:03.707]  The Constitution was implemented by force.
[01:41:03.747 --> 01:41:05.147]  It's not binding on anyone.
[01:41:05.207 --> 01:41:08.068]  How is a piece of paper binding on anyone?
[01:41:08.789 --> 01:41:09.269]  It's not.
[01:41:09.489 --> 01:41:10.869]  Well, the globalists say that, too.
[01:41:11.169 --> 01:41:13.730]  They have an anarchy of the private corporations.
[01:41:14.271 --> 01:41:14.551]  Anarchy?
[01:41:14.611 --> 01:41:15.551]  What are you talking about?
[01:41:17.949 --> 01:41:19.450]  You don't even know what your goals are.
[01:41:19.870 --> 01:41:22.331]  You think some people should control other people.
[01:41:22.611 --> 01:41:24.052]  Now let me just stop you.
[01:41:24.092 --> 01:41:28.074]  This is a legitimate person that disagrees, so I'm not blowing up at him.
[01:41:28.094 --> 01:41:31.615]  What he's saying is very important and in a very important debate.
[01:41:31.855 --> 01:41:32.415]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:41:33.136 --> 01:41:35.517]  You think some people should control other people.
[01:41:36.017 --> 01:41:36.877]  You think it's okay.
[01:41:36.917 --> 01:41:40.999]  You think a piece of paper gives some people control over other people.
[01:41:41.459 --> 01:41:43.660]  Is this piece of paper magic?
[01:41:44.180 --> 01:41:45.141]  Does it come from God?
[01:41:47.228 --> 01:41:48.929]  The Constitution is nothing.
[01:41:48.969 --> 01:41:50.449]  When you're ready for me to talk, I will.
[01:41:50.489 --> 01:41:51.950]  When you're ready for me to respond, I will.
[01:41:52.170 --> 01:41:52.970]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:41:53.210 --> 01:41:54.711]  No, that doesn't sound like you're done.
[01:41:54.731 --> 01:41:55.331]  You go right ahead.
[01:41:55.831 --> 01:41:56.852]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:41:57.072 --> 01:41:57.472]  Go ahead.
[01:41:57.512 --> 01:41:59.393]  How is this Constitution magic?
[01:41:59.673 --> 01:42:03.094]  How does anything that's written on it even matter?
[01:42:03.194 --> 01:42:05.315]  Let me ask you a couple questions here.
[01:42:06.747 --> 01:42:13.789]  If somebody kidnaps your daughter and chops her head off after he's done raping her, how is your anarchy going to stop him?
[01:42:13.809 --> 01:42:15.490]  Well, how is the government going to stop it?
[01:42:15.510 --> 01:42:16.570]  Do the police stop it?
[01:42:16.790 --> 01:42:18.250]  The police have no duty to protect.
[01:42:18.330 --> 01:42:19.651]  They did in the past, yes.
[01:42:19.951 --> 01:42:26.293]  When we had real police, crime was almost non-existent, and the kids could play outside on the front lawn, and we had almost no crime, yes.
[01:42:26.313 --> 01:42:29.374]  So you're saying police have a duty to protect and stop crime?
[01:42:29.974 --> 01:42:33.195]  Sir, I am... Police only show up after a crime is being committed.
[01:42:33.215 --> 01:42:33.955]  Sir, I do not...
[01:42:34.571 --> 01:42:36.052]  I do not believe in no government, buddy.
[01:42:36.872 --> 01:42:38.072]  Well, why don't you tell us why?
[01:42:38.172 --> 01:42:40.393]  Why don't you have an anarchist on and debate them?
[01:42:40.673 --> 01:42:41.934]  I'm going to try to... You can't!
[01:42:41.954 --> 01:42:43.915]  You're afraid of Mark Stevens.
[01:42:44.195 --> 01:42:45.615]  You won't have Mark Stevens on.
[01:42:45.915 --> 01:42:47.896]  You won't have Eric John Phelps on.
[01:42:48.196 --> 01:42:50.037]  You're scared to talk about the Jesuits.
[01:42:50.437 --> 01:42:52.458]  You think some people should control other people.
[01:42:52.498 --> 01:42:53.038]  You said it.
[01:42:53.358 --> 01:42:56.739]  You said you only think there's a criminal element inside the government.
[01:42:56.959 --> 01:42:58.540]  There's no one in the government that's good.
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:00.141]  They're all violent people.
[01:43:00.221 --> 01:43:02.301]  Everything government does is by force.
[01:43:02.662 --> 01:43:03.462]  It's by violence.
[01:43:03.482 --> 01:43:03.642]  Sir...
[01:43:05.393 --> 01:43:12.255]  You have legitimate issues you're bringing up, and you're not being dishonest about it, like the caller at the end of the last hour.
[01:43:12.275 --> 01:43:14.236]  He was asking for names.
[01:43:14.376 --> 01:43:16.617]  He wanted specific names.
[01:43:16.697 --> 01:43:20.398]  You have a lot of rhetoric and a lot of anger, and you obviously hate me.
[01:43:20.818 --> 01:43:21.739]  I appreciate your call.
[01:43:21.879 --> 01:43:23.339]  I listen every day, dude.
[01:43:23.599 --> 01:43:24.860]  I listen every day.
[01:43:25.180 --> 01:43:26.700]  What are you talking about I hate you?
[01:43:27.260 --> 01:43:30.361]  I get that from what you say.
[01:43:30.381 --> 01:43:32.862]  Tell us how the Constitution matters one bit.
[01:43:33.022 --> 01:43:34.163]  Sir, I'm going to answer your question.
[01:43:34.203 --> 01:43:34.863]  Thank you for the call.
[01:43:36.227 --> 01:43:46.454]  Number one, I've had Mark Stevens on this show, I think a couple times, and the last time I heard him locally on the radio, he was carried by a local station, he was plugging my website.
[01:43:46.994 --> 01:43:53.359]  And I've actually meant to call him to carry his book because I read it and think it's excellent.
[01:43:53.439 --> 01:43:55.720]  So another false accusation.
[01:43:57.301 --> 01:43:58.943]  I mean, I am so busy here.
[01:43:59.023 --> 01:44:00.784]  I am working so hard.
[01:44:02.176 --> 01:44:08.660]  That sometimes I'm deliriously tired, and there are so many books and so many interviews and so many people that I want to interview.
[01:44:08.820 --> 01:44:15.865]  I've never interviewed Carl Klang, and I heard him on the radio the other night, and I called and got his number and gave it to my producer and said, I want him on next week.
[01:44:16.985 --> 01:44:18.706]  Is it because I've never had Carl Klang on?
[01:44:18.727 --> 01:44:19.827]  Does it mean I'm afraid of him?
[01:44:19.887 --> 01:44:21.548]  No, it means I've never had him on.
[01:44:22.469 --> 01:44:24.190]  Now, you mentioned this other individual.
[01:44:24.210 --> 01:44:27.172]  I read his book, I guess, about four or five years ago.
[01:44:28.368 --> 01:44:28.528]  I think.
[01:44:28.548 --> 01:44:28.748]  I think.
[01:44:28.788 --> 01:44:28.989]  I think.
[01:44:42.506 --> 01:44:43.006]  We're good to go.
[01:45:09.921 --> 01:45:11.904]  People try to slap a lot of labels on me.
[01:45:12.004 --> 01:45:13.045]  Libertarian.
[01:45:13.085 --> 01:45:14.427]  If you're a conservative, I'm a liberal.
[01:45:14.467 --> 01:45:15.788]  If you're a liberal, I'm a right-winger.
[01:45:16.669 --> 01:45:17.931]  I'm a constitutionalist.
[01:45:18.715 --> 01:45:19.776]  I've read the Constitution.
[01:45:19.796 --> 01:45:20.536]  I've read the Bill of Rights.
[01:45:20.556 --> 01:45:21.937]  I've read the Declaration of Independence many times.
[01:45:21.957 --> 01:45:23.918]  I've read the Federalist Papers, the Anti-Federalist Papers.
[01:45:24.478 --> 01:45:30.301]  I have read upwards of probably 75 books about the Founding Fathers, by the Founding Fathers.
[01:45:30.341 --> 01:45:31.241]  I've read philosophy.
[01:45:31.281 --> 01:45:33.022]  I've read about the Greek system.
[01:45:33.102 --> 01:45:36.123]  I've read about the Roman Republic and the Roman system and its decline.
[01:45:36.603 --> 01:45:38.144]  I've studied Cicero.
[01:45:38.324 --> 01:45:41.086]  I have studied what happened all over the world.
[01:45:42.126 --> 01:45:46.128]  And the whole anarchist movement
[01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:51.504]  I'm not saying you, sir, but the anarchist movement itself was funded by the Illuminati.
[01:45:52.184 --> 01:45:54.546]  This call, anarchists grew into communists.
[01:45:54.586 --> 01:46:09.598]  You go see anarchist meetings, and I've gone to them, I've seen them, I've been there, and you've got the red bloc and the green bloc and the black bloc and the red bloc's the commies and the green bloc's commies that don't know it, and then the black bloc are led by government provocateurs, and they've death-threaded me here locally on videotape.
[01:46:11.140 --> 01:46:13.802]  And, sir, with six and a half billion people
[01:46:14.742 --> 01:46:17.142]  You're going to have government.
[01:46:18.683 --> 01:46:21.103]  And I want to follow God's law.
[01:46:22.424 --> 01:46:25.084]  I don't mean the law of these phony preachers that are not following.
[01:46:25.124 --> 01:46:32.405]  If you look at the Mosaic Law, which I've been studying a lot lately, and I like George Gordon.
[01:46:34.026 --> 01:46:37.366]  He really knows what he's talking about, and I've researched his claims.
[01:46:37.707 --> 01:46:38.227]  And they're true.
[01:46:39.167 --> 01:46:40.067]  He's an amazing mind.
[01:46:40.968 --> 01:46:47.031]  And I haven't had George Gordon on in years because I just haven't gotten around to it.
[01:46:47.051 --> 01:46:47.452]  I need to.
[01:46:48.012 --> 01:46:52.014]  But you need to understand, sir, that we don't need to follow man's law.
[01:46:52.434 --> 01:47:01.820]  And the Bill of Rights and Constitution was based on the Magna Carta 1215, based on the Mosaic Law that are laws that are good for society and are simple and make sense.
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:05.702]  And it is limiting government to a great extent.
[01:47:06.500 --> 01:47:08.182]  And believe me, search what the communists said.
[01:47:08.202 --> 01:47:09.523]  Oh, we don't want anybody with money.
[01:47:09.923 --> 01:47:12.345]  But then they're going to take everybody else's money and give it to themselves.
[01:47:12.425 --> 01:47:13.126]  Oh, an anarchist.
[01:47:13.366 --> 01:47:14.387]  We're not going to have any law.
[01:47:14.427 --> 01:47:15.228]  We don't need any law.
[01:47:15.588 --> 01:47:16.889]  I'm preparing back government 95%.
[01:47:18.250 --> 01:47:23.155]  That's what it was in comparison to the gross domestic product 150 years ago.
[01:47:23.956 --> 01:47:25.517]  I am preparing back government 95%.
[01:47:28.398 --> 01:47:36.804]  95%.
[01:47:29.319 --> 01:47:36.804]  But we do need courts, and we need to highly regulate those and be watchdogs and to educate the people about the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:47:37.264 --> 01:47:42.748]  And you are sitting there huffing and puffing and screaming at me full of righteous indignation.
[01:47:43.508 --> 01:47:47.212]  And I'd love to hear that kind of anger against your local government.
[01:47:47.532 --> 01:47:48.974]  I'd love to see you run for office.
[01:47:48.994 --> 01:47:51.156]  I'd love to see you fight the electronic voting machines.
[01:47:51.616 --> 01:47:55.660]  I'd love to see you out there in society actually getting something done.
[01:47:56.080 --> 01:48:05.750]  You know, if Ron Paul joins us in the next hour, which it looks like he will, he's just late in a committee meeting, I will pose your question to him, who I respect, Dr. Paul.
[01:48:06.818 --> 01:48:18.654]  But, sir, if you would like to present me with some anarchists who won't cuss and scream on the show, you didn't do that, but I've tried to pre-interview a few before to have them on, and they start screaming and cussing because they think it's real radical to break conventions.
[01:48:18.674 --> 01:48:23.040]  They don't even like our laws, our laws of not being potty mouths here on the air.
[01:48:24.260 --> 01:48:26.041]  But, you know, our rules.
[01:48:26.741 --> 01:48:27.861]  And this is my house.
[01:48:27.901 --> 01:48:28.922]  This is Genesis' house.
[01:48:28.982 --> 01:48:31.583]  We invite you in as guests, and we love you being part of it.
[01:48:31.623 --> 01:48:32.163]  We thank you.
[01:48:32.363 --> 01:48:36.264]  Just don't come in here and crap on us, to use French there.
[01:48:36.825 --> 01:48:39.266]  So I sat there and let you go, sir.
[01:48:39.286 --> 01:48:41.206]  You repeated the same thing about ten times in a row.
[01:48:41.666 --> 01:48:43.247]  But I can tell you mean what you say.
[01:48:44.142 --> 01:48:49.989]  And then I compared you to another caller who's a shill who calls all the shows, and the guy lied last hour.
[01:48:50.029 --> 01:48:51.991]  He said, oh, no, I think the government might be involved in 9-11.
[01:48:52.011 --> 01:49:00.020]  Well, I've heard him say it's a total lie, and they weren't involved on other shows, so I called the guy for being dishonest, and I mentioned that, and he threw it in my face and said that, too.
[01:49:00.681 --> 01:49:01.902]  No, that guy was legitimate, too.
[01:49:03.183 --> 01:49:05.426]  So, again...
[01:49:06.794 --> 01:49:11.596]  I have just spent six or seven minutes on this and not gotten to the news yet.
[01:49:11.636 --> 01:49:23.661]  So what's going to have to happen is, unfortunately, I'm sorry to the callers, but Russell and Fred and Mark and others, we'll get to you.
[01:49:23.941 --> 01:49:29.763]  It's just I've got to get through the news first, some of the news we haven't covered yet, before I get back to you.
[01:49:29.783 --> 01:49:31.404]  So if you want to hold, we'll get to you.
[01:49:32.333 --> 01:49:33.434]  And again, we don't screen the calls.
[01:49:33.454 --> 01:49:34.375]  You're welcome to call in.
[01:49:34.435 --> 01:49:36.577]  It is kind of an anarchy here on the air.
[01:49:36.617 --> 01:49:40.421]  It's just that I'm not going to be bullied and pushed into interviewing people.
[01:49:41.002 --> 01:49:43.304]  I will never interview that second individual you mentioned.
[01:49:44.045 --> 01:49:45.346]  Not if hell freezes over.
[01:49:45.906 --> 01:49:46.467]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:54.497 --> 01:50:01.880]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:50:02.140 --> 01:50:06.882]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:50:07.102 --> 01:50:12.744]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:50:13.004 --> 01:50:14.425]  ...and destroying our constitutional republic.

[01:51:06.667 --> 01:51:11.353]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:11.793 --> 01:51:18.516]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:18.916 --> 01:51:30.702]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:02.503]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:53:02.544 --> 01:53:04.787]  We just got a call from Ron Paul's office.
[01:53:04.807 --> 01:53:06.008]  He is coming up the next hour.
[01:53:06.068 --> 01:53:10.074]  They should end about ten minutes into the next hour with his meeting with three-star General Odom.
[01:53:10.615 --> 01:53:12.277]  He's been blowing the whistle on a bunch of issues.
[01:53:12.297 --> 01:53:14.701]  We'll get a report from the congressman on that.
[01:53:14.721 --> 01:53:16.143]  He's gracious to spend his time with us.
[01:53:17.738 --> 01:53:26.826]  I'm going to get into some more of the news right now, and then we'll start taking calls in the next hour until the Congressman joins us for about 20-30 minutes, then we'll get back into calls and news.
[01:53:27.186 --> 01:53:28.407]  Really scary article here.
[01:53:28.467 --> 01:53:33.812]  Sherry Blair is out promoting, I have her quotes here, that in the real world, we've got to torture and use the torture data.
[01:53:34.733 --> 01:53:35.593]  Just unbelievable.
[01:53:35.613 --> 01:53:36.174]  And another one.
[01:53:37.052 --> 01:53:39.634]  Morgue presses to stay quiet.
[01:53:40.974 --> 01:53:43.796]  Morgue pressed to stay quiet, if I can articulate that.
[01:53:44.337 --> 01:53:59.446]  It says officials overseeing Baghdad's morgue have come under pressure not to investigate the soaring number of apparent cases of executions and torture in the country, the former human rights chief of Iraq said yesterday.
[01:54:01.298 --> 01:54:02.599]  Again, it came out two weeks ago.
[01:54:02.659 --> 01:54:08.003]  Paul Watson wrote an article about it where he told foreign press that they're torturing to death 1,000 people a month.
[01:54:08.083 --> 01:54:09.464]  Okay, that's conservative numbers.
[01:54:09.845 --> 01:54:16.009]  John Pace, who left his post in Iraq earlier this month, spoke as Iraq and U.S.
[01:54:16.069 --> 01:54:26.057]  officials offered widely varying numbers for the toll so far on the explosion of sectarian violence that followed last Wednesday's bombing of a Shiite shrine in Samara.
[01:54:27.105 --> 01:54:28.786]  So pretty scary stuff.
[01:54:29.246 --> 01:54:37.209]  Gonzalez, this is out of the Washington Post as well, the Attorney General hints at wider surveillance program.
[01:54:37.269 --> 01:54:41.250]  Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez appeared to suggest Tuesday...
[01:54:42.034 --> 01:54:51.579]  But the Bush administration's warrantless domestic surveillance operations may extend beyond the outlines that the president acknowledged in mid-December.
[01:54:52.079 --> 01:55:08.048]  In a letter Tuesday to senators in which he asked to clarify his February 6th testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Gonzalez also seemed to imply that the administration's official legal justification of the program was not as clear-cut as he indicated three weeks ago.
[01:55:08.929 --> 01:55:17.558]  And so now he's floating the idea, quote, I did not and could not address in any classified intelligence activities using the administration's term for recently disclosed operation.
[01:55:17.598 --> 01:55:21.421]  He continued, I was confining my remarks to terrorist surveillance program.
[01:55:22.162 --> 01:55:23.243]  Now, don't you love that name?
[01:55:23.303 --> 01:55:24.564]  It's described by the president.
[01:55:25.125 --> 01:55:26.907]  And he went on to say it could be much wider.
[01:55:26.947 --> 01:55:30.850]  We already know it is, as some of their own agents have reported.
[01:55:30.870 --> 01:55:33.133]  It's been declassified for a long time.
[01:55:33.693 --> 01:55:38.657]  But the NSA has their own officers in all the major telecommunications hubs in the country.
[01:55:38.677 --> 01:55:43.581]  And we played CNBC report admitting that just a couple days ago.
[01:55:44.741 --> 01:55:48.224]  A crazy little clip here from Fox News that's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:55:48.564 --> 01:55:51.366]  Fox News, Iraq Civil War made up by the media.
[01:55:51.967 --> 01:55:57.071]  And Cavuto, in the Cavuto report, Your World with Cavuto, says that there's no civil war.
[01:55:57.371 --> 01:55:58.652]  It's an evil liberal lie.
[01:55:58.712 --> 01:56:00.393]  Okay, and the sun didn't come up this morning.
[01:56:00.814 --> 01:56:01.114]  It's a...
[01:56:02.120 --> 01:56:03.341]  Evil liberal lie.
[01:56:03.802 --> 01:56:07.165]  Lawmakers still angered but growing resigned over Port's deal.
[01:56:07.205 --> 01:56:08.546]  This is out of AP.
[01:56:09.347 --> 01:56:09.587]  U.S.
[01:56:09.627 --> 01:56:14.832]  lawmakers were losing hope of being able to block the controversial takeover of operations at several U.S.
[01:56:14.852 --> 01:56:20.357]  ports by a non-Arab Emirates-owned firm, with the deal becoming final on Tuesday.
[01:56:20.797 --> 01:56:26.262]  Members of Congress from both parties kept up their attacks against the impending $6.8 billion deal for next Tuesday.
[01:56:27.111 --> 01:56:27.712]  We're good to go.
[01:56:50.726 --> 01:56:53.267]  And they're being told to sit down and to shut up.
[01:56:53.327 --> 01:57:03.451]  And it doesn't matter how corrupt this deal is or how many Bushes are getting money for it or how many federal laws are violated or that the head of their company is going to be heading up the new federal agency over all the ports.
[01:57:03.811 --> 01:57:04.491]  It doesn't matter.
[01:57:05.251 --> 01:57:09.193]  And back to the other callers saying under our Constitution, 200 guys run things.
[01:57:09.253 --> 01:57:11.373]  No, you've got 500 and something in the Congress.
[01:57:12.254 --> 01:57:18.856]  And then you've got the judiciary, you've got the executive, and they're all supposed to war with each other to keep anyone from centralizing power.
[01:57:19.460 --> 01:57:29.343]  You're going to have a government, so they did the next best thing, knowing human nature, and broke it up in different divisions of power to stop a dictator from rising.
[01:57:29.863 --> 01:57:30.584]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:30.604 --> 01:57:31.024]  Stay with us.
[01:57:33.445 --> 01:57:38.346]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.854 --> 01:57:50.456]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.141 --> 01:57:52.201]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.922 --> 01:57:54.002]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.662 --> 01:57:55.483]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.243 --> 01:57:57.163]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.183 --> 01:58:01.625]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.005 --> 01:58:06.107]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.067 --> 01:58:10.489]  Well, we're blasting through this broadcast today.
[01:58:10.569 --> 01:58:13.370]  Ron Paul is scheduled to join us in the next 10-15 minutes or so.
[01:58:13.830 --> 01:58:15.431]  Congressman on a host of issues.
[01:58:15.891 --> 01:58:18.352]  Continuing with a bunch of other news this hour.
[01:58:19.584 --> 01:58:22.627]  But right now, let's go back to the calls.
[01:58:22.787 --> 01:58:29.952]  Evan and Reno wanted to call back in and comment on the guy that said he was an anarchist 15 minutes ago who was just viciously attacking me.
[01:58:30.793 --> 01:58:33.896]  And I was trying to let the guy make his points, but he just was so angry.
[01:58:34.436 --> 01:58:35.897]  But you wanted to say something, Evan?
[01:58:35.917 --> 01:58:38.259]  You say you're an anarchist and you wanted to comment.
[01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:41.882]  Yeah, Alex, I just want to apologize for him.
[01:58:41.902 --> 01:58:45.365]  First of all, I don't know what the specific subsect is.
[01:58:45.385 --> 01:58:48.387]  I'm a market anarchist or anarcho-capitalist.
[01:58:49.252 --> 01:58:51.553]  I could also, you could refer to me as a Christian anarchist.
[01:58:52.753 --> 01:58:58.635]  But what I saw, I mean, we are very close to constitutionalism.
[01:58:59.935 --> 01:59:04.077]  It's based on paleo-libertarianism or paleo-liberalism, the old right.
[01:59:05.317 --> 01:59:11.559]  It's based on the non-invasion principle, the non-aggression axiom, and...
[01:59:13.137 --> 01:59:14.077]  Private property rights.
[01:59:14.357 --> 01:59:16.458]  Yeah, the no initiation of physical force.
[01:59:16.738 --> 01:59:19.459]  Exactly, which is basically what constitutionalism is.
[01:59:19.479 --> 01:59:24.461]  Well, I believe in that, but I'm going to be beat over the head because I believe there should be no government?
[01:59:24.881 --> 01:59:26.002]  Well, no, and that's the thing.
[01:59:26.062 --> 01:59:27.722]  It's like he needs to understand.
[01:59:28.003 --> 01:59:31.644]  What his problem was is he needs to understand that everyone is entitled to their view.
[01:59:32.504 --> 01:59:38.386]  And whether you see that as the ultimate goal or not, you're still working on the same side.
[01:59:38.506 --> 01:59:41.248]  You're still working for a side that wants to minimize government.
[01:59:41.268 --> 01:59:42.368]  And I wanted to just go...
[01:59:43.160 --> 01:59:44.921]  All I wanted to say, I wanted to go to a quote.
[01:59:45.661 --> 01:59:47.682]  You probably, you know who Henry David Thoreau is.
[01:59:48.202 --> 01:59:50.983]  He wrote essays on civil disobedience.
[01:59:51.023 --> 01:59:55.005]  He inspired Gandhi, who in turn inspired Martin Luther King.
[01:59:55.305 --> 01:59:58.087]  He's probably one of the most influential writers in American history.
[01:59:58.147 --> 01:59:58.907]  I'm familiar with him.
[01:59:59.147 --> 02:00:00.167]  Tell us about it.
[02:00:00.408 --> 02:00:01.608]  Well, I just want to read this quote.
[02:00:01.648 --> 02:00:03.449]  It's from his essays on civil disobedience.
[02:00:03.489 --> 02:00:08.271]  He said, I heartily accept the motto that government is best which governs least.
[02:00:08.831 --> 02:00:12.593]  And I should like to see it acted up more rapidly and systematically
[02:00:13.143 --> 02:00:18.484]  Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which I also believe, that government is best which governs not at all.
[02:00:18.884 --> 02:00:22.925]  And when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have.
[02:00:23.345 --> 02:00:33.467]  But, to speak practically and as a citizen, unlike those who call themselves no-government men, I ask for, not at once no government, but at once a better government.
[02:00:33.807 --> 02:00:37.608]  Let every man make known what kind of government would command his respect.
[02:00:38.109 --> 02:00:46.424]  And that will be the one step toward... Yeah, people don't even know the standards of anything or even what freedom is, so we've got to set about educating the people.
[02:00:46.464 --> 02:00:51.333]  The globalists say they've got to dumb them down in their own foundational doctrines, so we've got to reverse that.
[02:00:52.003 --> 02:00:52.784]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:00:52.864 --> 02:00:56.926]  I mean, government is of the mind more than it is even physical.
[02:00:56.966 --> 02:01:04.611]  We're trying to unlock minds and get people out of these dungeons, and meanwhile I'm being squawked at by someone who's very self-righteous.
[02:01:05.832 --> 02:01:13.977]  There's that entrapment of not looking at anyone else but yourself, the narcissism of our society today.
[02:01:14.257 --> 02:01:15.738]  I'm talking a lot about that.
[02:01:15.939 --> 02:01:18.060]  I, from about age three, have been outward-looking.
[02:01:18.809 --> 02:01:19.069]  Yeah.
[02:01:19.109 --> 02:01:22.871]  And most people are totally looking inward, and they're missing the whole world.
[02:01:23.532 --> 02:01:34.318]  And that's the thing about, well, especially about market anarchy principles, is we are not, we're not about, it's not about imposing your views on anyone else.
[02:01:34.438 --> 02:01:37.800]  It's like, it's completely voluntary.
[02:01:37.820 --> 02:01:41.882]  By making your own choices in the free market, you will shift the paradigm.
[02:01:42.401 --> 02:01:42.841]  Exactly.
[02:01:42.861 --> 02:01:45.523]  It's voluntarism, is another way to put it.
[02:01:45.543 --> 02:01:46.384]  It's actually very good.
[02:01:47.105 --> 02:01:48.846]  You probably know lewrockwell.com.
[02:01:49.086 --> 02:02:00.174]  I believe in voluntarism until there is force initiated, and then we must have highly controlled mechanisms where we contract together to be able to go out.
[02:02:00.855 --> 02:02:09.481]  Look, real anarchy would break into warlords in a week, and then king warlords, and then wars between those king warlords, and then you'd have a dictatorship.
[02:02:09.901 --> 02:02:13.042]  Which is why there's none of those principles there involved.
[02:02:13.062 --> 02:02:19.264]  There's not a non-aggression axiom, there's not a non-invasion principle, and there's not a private property right, free market economy.
[02:02:20.324 --> 02:02:23.445]  Yeah, well, humans are going to get together and form governments.
[02:02:24.325 --> 02:02:26.126]  You know, I mean, it happens.
[02:02:26.186 --> 02:02:26.666]  I mean, you could...
[02:02:27.765 --> 02:02:29.386]  Government's like a relative word.
[02:02:29.446 --> 02:02:29.826]  I hear you.
[02:02:29.867 --> 02:02:30.767]  I've got to let you go.
[02:02:31.147 --> 02:02:31.448]  I agree.
[02:02:31.468 --> 02:02:32.148]  I've got to let you go.
[02:02:32.548 --> 02:02:37.792]  I mean, it's like when the Jews said, the Israelites said, we want a king, give us Saul.
[02:02:37.852 --> 02:02:39.593]  Things got real bad after they got that government.
[02:02:40.994 --> 02:02:42.435]  They had a government before that.
[02:02:42.675 --> 02:02:43.276]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:46.730 --> 02:02:49.572]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.832 --> 02:02:50.532]  Hello, my friends.
[02:02:50.632 --> 02:02:51.433]  Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.753 --> 02:02:56.436]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.776 --> 02:03:03.520]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:05.822]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:06.022 --> 02:03:08.865]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.965 --> 02:03:13.629]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.829 --> 02:03:18.233]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.473 --> 02:03:25.700]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[02:03:47.426 --> 02:03:48.466]  The war on terrorism.
[02:03:48.807 --> 02:03:51.588]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:51.848 --> 02:03:56.010]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:56.430 --> 02:03:57.270]  So what do you do?
[02:03:57.570 --> 02:04:02.172]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:02.652 --> 02:04:04.773]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:04:05.254 --> 02:04:06.114]  Sheltering in place.
[02:04:06.556 --> 02:04:19.946]  Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:19.986 --> 02:04:27.052]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:56.404]  That is why at ResearchedHerbs.com we take pride in offering you herbs whose safety and effectiveness have been proven time and time again.
[02:04:56.844 --> 02:05:10.192]  For example, did you know that Lid 52, the top-selling natural herbal supplement for liver diseases since 1930, is backed by over 300 research studies and clinical trials and prescribed by more than 200,000 health professionals worldwide?
[02:05:10.512 --> 02:05:14.254]  In fact, the effectiveness of all the herbs featured on ResearchedHerbs.com
[02:05:14.565 --> 02:05:15.485]  We're good to go.
[02:05:15.505 --> 02:05:15.745]  I think?
[02:05:50.009 --> 02:05:50.650]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.330 --> 02:05:52.371]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.092 --> 02:05:54.192]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.853 --> 02:05:55.673]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.414 --> 02:05:57.315]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.995 --> 02:06:01.938]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.178 --> 02:06:04.520]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[02:06:05.420 --> 02:06:06.281]  Alex Jones.
[02:06:06.341 --> 02:06:10.265]  Congressman Ron Paul is stuck in a meeting.
[02:06:10.425 --> 02:06:12.126]  He should be out any minute calling us.
[02:06:12.146 --> 02:06:14.969]  I'll tell you, as soon as that happens, your calls are coming up as well.
[02:06:14.989 --> 02:06:22.435]  Everybody that's patiently holding, Fred and Mark and James and Elias and many others, toll free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231 on this live Thursday edition, second day of March 2006.
[02:06:22.495 --> 02:06:24.437]  The websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:06:30.502 --> 02:06:37.365]  Well, lawmakers tell the Associated Press that they're still angry, but growing resignation over Ports' deal that will be signed next Tuesday.
[02:06:37.405 --> 02:06:37.985]  And it's a done deal.
[02:06:38.005 --> 02:06:40.806]  It doesn't matter if 80-plus percent of Americans are against it.
[02:06:40.826 --> 02:06:43.027]  It doesn't matter if most Democrats and Republicans are against it.
[02:06:43.047 --> 02:06:46.809]  It doesn't matter if federal law was violated up one side and down the other in the deal.
[02:06:47.089 --> 02:06:49.490]  That's all going to be ignored, and it's going to be transferred.
[02:06:49.510 --> 02:06:51.631]  21-plus Ports, they won't tell us.
[02:06:51.651 --> 02:06:52.631]  They just say it's over 21.
[02:06:53.152 --> 02:06:56.433]  That's what the documents are now showing, and much of it is secret.
[02:06:58.078 --> 02:07:03.440]  And Bill Clinton, we now learn, according to the Financial Times of London, was involved in consulting on the deal.
[02:07:03.460 --> 02:07:04.080]  Of course he is.
[02:07:04.120 --> 02:07:08.722]  He's involved with the Bushes and the Carlaw Group and been one of their agents for a long, long time.
[02:07:09.102 --> 02:07:20.506]  Talking about mind control, big Federation of American Scientists, big Academy of Sciences report yesterday where they're saying kids need to be fitted with microchips in their teeth in the near future for the new national ID card.
[02:07:20.526 --> 02:07:23.367]  It will keep us all very safe, and you'll get a better insurance deal if you do it.
[02:07:24.534 --> 02:07:26.196]  That even covered that story yesterday.
[02:07:26.216 --> 02:07:27.897]  That's how passe it's gotten.
[02:07:28.718 --> 02:07:32.762]  Well, here is a new article on this out of London Independent today.
[02:07:34.243 --> 02:07:37.867]  Pentagon develops brain implants to turn sharks into military spies.
[02:07:38.627 --> 02:07:47.552]  Military scientists in the United States are developing a new way of manipulating sharks by remote control to turn them into underwater spies or weapons.
[02:07:47.572 --> 02:07:48.733]  That's right out of James Bond.
[02:07:49.233 --> 02:07:53.256]  Engineers funded by the Pentagon have created electronic brain implants.
[02:07:53.696 --> 02:07:55.017]  They've done this with mammals, too.
[02:07:55.097 --> 02:07:57.078]  They have rats that can be remote controlled.
[02:07:57.959 --> 02:08:06.748]  Cockroaches 25 years ago that were remote controlled for fish that they hope will be able to influence the movements of sharks and perhaps even decode what they're sensing.
[02:08:07.268 --> 02:08:18.339]  Although both Cold War superpowers have trained sea mammals such as dolphinos, the porpoise, and of course even what otters and seals.
[02:08:18.800 --> 02:08:19.541]  Let me just start over.
[02:08:20.780 --> 02:08:29.882]  Although both Cold War superpowers have trained sea mammals, such as dolphins and killer whales, to carry out quasi-military duties, they train killer whales to eat people, folks.
[02:08:30.702 --> 02:08:34.463]  This is probably the first time the military have seriously considered using fish.
[02:08:34.963 --> 02:08:42.284]  They have the dolphins deliver weapons or surveil, and they even have killer whales deliver larger weapons to the sides of ships and to attack.
[02:08:43.085 --> 02:08:50.026]  The Pentagon hopes to exploit the ability of sharks to glide quietly through the water, sense delicate electronic signals,
[02:08:50.858 --> 02:08:56.620]  Gadgets, that says gradients, and follow chemical trails according to New Scientist magazines.
[02:08:57.080 --> 02:09:09.105]  These researchers hope such implants will improve our understanding of how the animal interacts with their environment as well as boosting research into tackling human paralysis, says New Scientist.
[02:09:09.405 --> 02:09:11.806]  But the research also has a military objective.
[02:09:11.846 --> 02:09:17.908]  By remotely guiding sharks' movements, they hope to transform the animals into stealth spies...
[02:09:18.951 --> 02:09:22.713]  Perhaps capable of following vessels without being spotted, the magazine says.
[02:09:23.073 --> 02:09:33.157]  The neural implants consist of electrodes buried in the fish's brain, which can then be triggered through remote control to stimulate specific areas of the animal's central nervous system.
[02:09:33.557 --> 02:09:37.479]  Yeah, they can control mammals and arachnids, insects.
[02:09:38.019 --> 02:09:39.579]  Everything is remote controllable.
[02:09:40.040 --> 02:09:41.360]  I mean, with a joystick.
[02:09:41.920 --> 02:09:45.362]  RoboRat came out of what they declassified that five years ago.
[02:09:46.102 --> 02:09:48.003]  RoboRat will do whatever they tell you.
[02:09:48.604 --> 02:09:58.828]  I remember seeing a study 10 years ago where the cat, they can make the cat urinate, defecate, walk, left or right, bite, go into convulsions or die.
[02:09:58.928 --> 02:09:59.668]  It's quite nice.
[02:10:00.329 --> 02:10:03.510]  And they have similar systems that they're trying to develop for humans.
[02:10:04.530 --> 02:10:09.092]  Interesting little tidbit of news for you on that.
[02:10:09.919 --> 02:10:12.982]  We wrote some articles after the horrible tsunami a year ago.
[02:10:13.102 --> 02:10:17.846]  Plus, flashback, don't give your tsunami donations to the Red Cross.
[02:10:17.886 --> 02:10:20.968]  Another one, don't give your hurricane donations to the American Red Cross.
[02:10:22.289 --> 02:10:26.113]  And our comment is, profiting from disaster, destruction, and death.
[02:10:26.173 --> 02:10:27.133]  It's the globalist way.
[02:10:27.173 --> 02:10:28.454]  Here's the London Telegraph article.
[02:10:28.835 --> 02:10:32.738]  Millions given to tsunami sitting in U.N.
[02:10:32.918 --> 02:10:33.739]  bank accounts.
[02:10:34.511 --> 02:10:44.617]  Millions of pounds of taxpayer money given by the government to the Asian tsunami appeal could still be sitting in bank accounts of UN agencies and charities spending.
[02:10:44.737 --> 02:10:53.643]  Watchdog groups have found 50 million pounds, or roughly $90 million, was paid out within weeks of the disaster.
[02:10:53.723 --> 02:10:58.025]  Delays in setting up humanitarian projects have left an unknown sum unspent.
[02:10:58.045 --> 02:11:00.087]  It's the same thing with the Red Cross.
[02:11:00.127 --> 02:11:01.908]  They kept half of the billions they got for 9-11.
[02:11:03.246 --> 02:11:06.370]  And they kept promising, oh, we give all this to the American people.
[02:11:06.390 --> 02:11:11.416]  And then during the hurricane disaster, days after they had to have the Red Cross up on national TV,
[02:11:12.404 --> 02:11:16.367]  The spokesman up there said, oh, they have the Red Cross.
[02:11:16.387 --> 02:11:19.089]  We're getting a lot of calls to the donation center saying you keep the money.
[02:11:19.409 --> 02:11:20.530]  Tell them you don't keep the money.
[02:11:20.590 --> 02:11:21.631]  And she didn't say they didn't keep it.
[02:11:21.651 --> 02:11:24.072]  She says, oh, we care about the people.
[02:11:24.493 --> 02:11:25.333]  That's all she'd say.
[02:11:26.154 --> 02:11:27.475]  And guess who they give the money to?
[02:11:27.955 --> 02:11:29.756]  Handgun Control, Inc.
[02:11:29.856 --> 02:11:30.917]  So does United Way.
[02:11:31.337 --> 02:11:36.281]  Tens of millions for gun control and other similar programs.
[02:11:37.105 --> 02:11:44.050]  And I remember back when 9-11 happened, I actually lost a few affiliates because I went on air and said, don't give money to the Red Cross, they will steal it.
[02:11:44.811 --> 02:11:55.098]  There had only been, no exaggeration, it had to be more than 20 articles I'd seen where they openly steal mail full of cash and sign checks over themselves.
[02:11:55.138 --> 02:11:57.860]  I mean, they're so criminal, it boggles the mind.
[02:11:57.900 --> 02:12:00.803]  Now, you as a member of Red Cross actually help people.
[02:12:01.603 --> 02:12:02.664]  If you want to help the Red Cross...
[02:12:03.320 --> 02:12:04.301]  They do a little bit.
[02:12:04.441 --> 02:12:09.746]  You can go be a volunteer and actually hand out water and blankets and give blankets, and that actually gets there.
[02:12:10.006 --> 02:12:15.251]  But you give money or blood to these people, it gets sold for medical experiments or for blood sales.
[02:12:16.072 --> 02:12:18.073]  It's a criminal organization.
[02:12:19.234 --> 02:12:23.118]  They've been found guilty multiple times in civil and criminal court.
[02:12:24.799 --> 02:12:27.582]  And it goes way back a long, long time.
[02:12:28.650 --> 02:12:34.776]  But, of course, later those stations turned the show back on and apologized, which was very big of them, after it came out months later, exactly what I'd said they were doing.
[02:12:35.097 --> 02:12:36.018]  Not that I'm that smart.
[02:12:36.118 --> 02:12:37.479]  I just know what they do.
[02:12:39.481 --> 02:12:41.003]  It's just that simple.
[02:12:41.843 --> 02:12:45.747]  Here is another report, and this is...
[02:12:47.506 --> 02:12:51.371]  A new CDC report, and they have different federal and state numbers here.
[02:12:51.411 --> 02:13:00.383]  Study shows decline in neurodevelopmental disorders after removal of the Marisol, that's mercury, contained vaccines.
[02:13:01.121 --> 02:13:01.321]  I think?
[02:13:23.681 --> 02:13:24.041]  Thank you.
[02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:52.003]  And it showed a substantive decrease in the massive trend of increasing autism.
[02:13:52.063 --> 02:13:57.546]  Now, let me just... I don't have time to read this lengthy scientific report on air, but I have read it, and you can go read it on the website.
[02:13:57.926 --> 02:13:59.947]  Let me just break this down why I don't believe this.
[02:14:02.135 --> 02:14:15.318]  All that happened four years ago is under federal regulations, vaccine makers were instructed to offer non-thimerosal-containing vaccines to doctors and clinics.
[02:14:17.479 --> 02:14:18.599]  That's all that happened.
[02:14:19.860 --> 02:14:23.521]  And then people trying to go in and get these, they have to special order them.
[02:14:23.581 --> 02:14:25.161]  On average, they cost twice as much.
[02:14:27.233 --> 02:14:34.479]  And so I've seen the federal numbers that only a small amount of people were actually getting the non-thimerosal vaccines.
[02:14:34.559 --> 02:14:42.907]  And then in several major vaccine areas, like the flu vaccine, we had a quadruples four.
[02:14:43.027 --> 02:14:43.867]  What's five?
[02:14:44.268 --> 02:14:45.509]  I don't know the number for that.
[02:14:45.569 --> 02:14:46.730]  I do, but I don't place it.
[02:14:47.571 --> 02:14:50.233]  It went up five-fold the level of mercury.
[02:14:51.683 --> 02:14:58.628]  So it went from, well, 250 times safe levels with the increase, and that's Associated Press.
[02:14:58.648 --> 02:14:59.968]  For some reason, they increased it.
[02:15:00.549 --> 02:15:03.551]  And the MMR shot increased it, the one they give kids.
[02:15:03.591 --> 02:15:08.113]  And some of the different hepatitis A, B, and C multi-shots increased it.
[02:15:08.594 --> 02:15:08.894]  Why?
[02:15:08.954 --> 02:15:09.374]  I don't know.
[02:15:09.434 --> 02:15:10.575]  I mean, figure it out yourself.
[02:15:12.276 --> 02:15:14.698]  So then we see this marked decrease.
[02:15:14.738 --> 02:15:16.779]  Now, it's a decrease in the increase.
[02:15:17.876 --> 02:15:26.803]  We went from 25 years ago, 1 in 24,000 having autism, to 1 in 1,600, and the new trends were showing 1 in 160.
[02:15:27.184 --> 02:15:29.345]  Now, those are the official numbers.
[02:15:29.906 --> 02:15:31.807]  How many medical doctors have we had on talking about it?
[02:15:31.827 --> 02:15:33.108]  We covered the statistics.
[02:15:33.229 --> 02:15:35.871]  Now, that trend has slowed.
[02:15:36.311 --> 02:15:37.192]  And I guess if...
[02:15:38.963 --> 02:15:47.192]  A small percentage of the population isn't taking these, or large portions of the population, it's a minority but a growing minority, is not taking them, period.
[02:15:47.552 --> 02:15:50.556]  So yes, you're going to see a decrease in the increase of this.
[02:15:50.916 --> 02:15:53.119]  But the thimerosal is not out.
[02:15:53.499 --> 02:16:06.932]  Plus, the vaccines have been found to have bacteria, funguses, viruses, and all sorts of other toxins in it, and that's why you cannot trust the vaccines, and you cannot trust the big military industrial complex companies that own the vaccine makers.
[02:16:06.992 --> 02:16:11.036]  You cannot trust the vaccine supply in this country.
[02:16:11.556 --> 02:16:13.578]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:16:13.678 --> 02:16:17.482]  In more cases than not, they admit that, quote, they're tainted vaccines.
[02:16:18.542 --> 02:16:20.043]  And so could vaccines be helpful?
[02:16:20.083 --> 02:16:20.924]  Could they do good?
[02:16:21.004 --> 02:16:21.284]  Yes.
[02:16:21.685 --> 02:16:27.410]  If psychopaths didn't run the government and if there wasn't such a huge track record of vaccines causing problems.
[02:16:27.450 --> 02:16:34.796]  But now they're making hundreds of vaccines and trying to make them mandatory for bacteria that get in the ear canal and for smoking cigarettes and for this and that.
[02:16:35.576 --> 02:16:36.477]  We're good to go.
[02:16:58.027 --> 02:17:00.230]  We'll break, find out what's going on with Ron Paul.
[02:17:00.270 --> 02:17:03.794]  That's why it's always kind of a hassle with congressmen, but he's normally there right on time.
[02:17:03.814 --> 02:17:09.681]  Most of the others, they're always on an hour later than they say they will be, but he's almost always here on time.
[02:17:09.721 --> 02:17:14.847]  But today he got caught up in some meetings, but he's scheduled coming up here very, very soon.
[02:17:15.207 --> 02:17:15.868]  If not, he'll be on.
[02:17:16.969 --> 02:17:17.630]  In the near future.
[02:17:17.650 --> 02:17:18.851]  This has only happened a few times with him.
[02:17:19.211 --> 02:17:21.533]  But he was scheduled to be joining us 19 minutes ago.
[02:17:21.974 --> 02:17:22.995]  He is not yet here.
[02:17:23.015 --> 02:17:26.458]  We'll give you that answer when we get back after this quick break.
[02:17:26.958 --> 02:17:28.920]  And we'll take your calls if he isn't there with us.
[02:17:28.980 --> 02:17:34.085]  If he is, we'll spend about 20 minutes with him and then take your calls and cover more here in the stack.
[02:17:34.145 --> 02:17:35.446]  Bird flu likely in the U.S.
[02:17:35.486 --> 02:17:35.786]  soon.
[02:17:36.107 --> 02:17:40.751]  Health security officials say and much more on the other side.
[02:17:40.991 --> 02:17:41.692]  Keep it locked in.
[02:17:45.862 --> 02:17:47.543]  What causes foods to spoil?
[02:17:47.983 --> 02:17:50.964]  All produce produces a natural gas which causes ripening.
[02:17:51.284 --> 02:17:56.566]  In addition, foods like onions and garlic emit odors, causing foods to lose their freshness and flavor.
[02:17:56.866 --> 02:18:06.389]  Now there's Forever Fresh for the fridge, a revolutionary new product proven to eliminate refrigerator odors and guaranteed to keep produce fresh at least twice as long as normal.
[02:18:06.669 --> 02:18:08.870]  Nancy McKimson of Jacksonville, Florida says...
[02:18:09.170 --> 02:18:12.714]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, everything stays fresh much longer.
[02:18:12.974 --> 02:18:16.217]  Like strawberries, which now last a couple of weeks instead of just a few days.
[02:18:16.477 --> 02:18:20.021]  Jane Burke of New Jersey says... You know, we eat a lot of salads.
[02:18:20.181 --> 02:18:23.664]  I used to throw out the leftovers because they'd turn brown and they'd shrivel up.
[02:18:23.804 --> 02:18:25.066]  I'm really amazed.
[02:18:25.206 --> 02:18:31.051]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, all my produce stays fresher longer, including the leftovers.
[02:18:31.191 --> 02:18:33.614]  Now I just couldn't get along without Forever Fresh.
[02:18:33.954 --> 02:18:40.428]  To order your Forever Fresh for the fridge, visit the web at foreverfresh.us or call toll-free 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[02:18:40.569 --> 02:18:42.052]  That's 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[02:18:44.864 --> 02:18:45.844]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:18:45.924 --> 02:18:50.686]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:18:50.866 --> 02:18:58.669]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:18:58.929 --> 02:19:04.291]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:19:04.511 --> 02:19:11.493]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:19:11.733 --> 02:19:12.213]  We're good to go.
[02:19:30.382 --> 02:19:36.645]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[02:19:36.945 --> 02:19:40.467]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:40.807 --> 02:19:43.088]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:43.168 --> 02:19:44.749]  Hello, folks.
[02:19:44.769 --> 02:19:45.769]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:19:46.130 --> 02:19:51.872]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:19:52.132 --> 02:19:57.215]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:19:57.575 --> 02:20:06.902]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[02:20:07.222 --> 02:20:12.166]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[02:20:12.506 --> 02:20:16.529]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[02:20:16.729 --> 02:20:21.433]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[02:20:21.833 --> 02:20:27.799]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[02:20:28.099 --> 02:20:33.425]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:20:33.445 --> 02:20:34.906]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[02:20:34.966 --> 02:20:36.308]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:20:44.304 --> 02:20:54.587]  TriVortex technology features subtle energy products that include an item called TriVives that allow you to save hundreds of dollars by wearing rather than orally taking vitamins and nutrients.
[02:20:55.087 --> 02:21:03.409]  When you purchase TriVortex technology products, you make possible outstanding GCN programs such as the Power Hour, Alex Jones, Jack Blood, and Greg Szymanski.
[02:21:03.989 --> 02:21:12.491]  The GCN staff and countless GCN listeners benefit from TriVortex technology products on a daily basis to increase energy levels and for fast pain relief.
[02:21:13.248 --> 02:21:20.731]  Go to TriVortex.com, that is T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X.com, or call me, Brian, at 619-884-1455.
[02:21:24.473 --> 02:21:30.556]  Yes, everything about TriVortex technology, including fast pain relief, is real, true, and honest.
[02:21:31.238 --> 02:21:32.179]  We're good to go.
[02:21:52.348 --> 02:21:53.389]  Alex Jones Show!
[02:22:21.570 --> 02:22:26.735]  Listening to your news, I came up with a question I wanted to ask you last week.
[02:22:26.836 --> 02:22:27.937]  Who owns these ports?
[02:22:30.600 --> 02:22:39.048]  The International Oriental Steam Navigation Company, a 150-year-old British company.
[02:22:40.530 --> 02:22:43.373]  Did the taxpayers ever basically pay for the ports?
[02:22:43.993 --> 02:22:45.576]  Yes, sir.
[02:22:45.616 --> 02:22:47.800]  Most of these ports were built with taxpayer money.
[02:22:47.820 --> 02:22:48.622]  They were expanded.
[02:22:49.424 --> 02:22:53.612]  Most of the East Coast ports actually looked that up and saw it in a report during World War II.
[02:22:54.913 --> 02:22:58.897]  We pay for it, and then just by fiat decision, they just decide to give it away.
[02:22:59.137 --> 02:23:03.041]  Well, see, Spain is not buying the roads.
[02:23:03.382 --> 02:23:04.423]  It's being given to them.
[02:23:04.443 --> 02:23:11.030]  They say, we'll pay you exorbitant prices to take them over from us because they come and give campaign contributions.
[02:23:11.130 --> 02:23:13.232]  It is signing over the infrastructure.
[02:23:13.272 --> 02:23:15.835]  They say, buy our T-bills, buy our debt.
[02:23:15.855 --> 02:23:17.997]  I mean, we're not getting all these cheap goods for free, folks.
[02:23:18.697 --> 02:23:19.939]  And they're selling the country out.
[02:23:19.979 --> 02:23:23.061]  The country is now majority owned by foreign nations.
[02:23:23.362 --> 02:23:26.464]  There are more foreign lobbyists than there are American lobbyists.
[02:23:26.965 --> 02:23:31.349]  Does this have to do with the hypothecation of the debt to the Federal Reserve?
[02:23:31.749 --> 02:23:32.990]  Yes, that's exactly what it is.
[02:23:33.030 --> 02:23:35.172]  We had Paul Craig Roberts talked about that.
[02:23:35.192 --> 02:23:36.974]  We had an economist on.
[02:23:37.014 --> 02:23:39.857]  We had Bartlett on last week talking about it.
[02:23:39.877 --> 02:23:40.617]  Or was that Monday?
[02:23:41.078 --> 02:23:42.459]  And that's exactly what's happening.
[02:23:42.479 --> 02:23:43.280]  That's official, sir.
[02:23:43.960 --> 02:23:44.541]  So instead of...
[02:23:45.185 --> 02:23:54.555]  So basically what they're doing is they're selling off, like you said on Coast to Coast, they're selling off our assets, basically pay off the debt and also create their new world order.
[02:23:55.216 --> 02:23:56.157]  So it's a two-pronged...
[02:23:57.205 --> 02:23:59.866]  But we're $80 trillion in debt.
[02:24:00.467 --> 02:24:05.449]  As Paul Craig Roberts and even the Dallas Morning News said, $43 trillion in debt a couple of years ago.
[02:24:05.469 --> 02:24:06.490]  It's much more than that.
[02:24:07.490 --> 02:24:09.952]  So it's well over $80 trillion.
[02:24:10.192 --> 02:24:12.873]  The debt system, these banks print the money out of nothing.
[02:24:13.333 --> 02:24:14.934]  It's designed to implode.
[02:24:14.954 --> 02:24:16.855]  It's designed where you cannot pay it off.
[02:24:17.436 --> 02:24:18.856]  It's like loan sharking rates of 100%.
[02:24:19.917 --> 02:24:21.698]  It's designed to be impossible to pay off.
[02:24:22.198 --> 02:24:23.679]  Well, they print the money, then they...
[02:24:24.835 --> 02:24:26.917]  And then they loan it back to us at interest.
[02:24:27.077 --> 02:24:28.959]  They own the currency, and then they own the debt.
[02:24:29.499 --> 02:24:29.799]  Yes.
[02:24:29.899 --> 02:24:32.081]  And then they get real assets for it.
[02:24:33.803 --> 02:24:39.908]  So when you say basically pirates and criminals have gotten control, does that really mean it?
[02:24:40.128 --> 02:24:41.169]  No, I mean it's literal, sir.
[02:24:41.229 --> 02:24:41.689]  It's literal.
[02:24:42.250 --> 02:24:42.810]  Absolutely.
[02:24:42.870 --> 02:24:43.671]  It's not figurative.
[02:24:44.271 --> 02:24:44.531]  Oh, I know.
[02:24:46.633 --> 02:24:47.874]  And it isn't enough for them.
[02:24:47.994 --> 02:24:51.077]  Under Department of Labor, the documents say they own us.
[02:24:51.775 --> 02:24:54.797]  Because we are the final guarantors of the debt.
[02:24:54.817 --> 02:24:56.458]  We're called human resources now.
[02:24:57.138 --> 02:24:58.779]  And they, quote, own our children.
[02:24:59.100 --> 02:25:02.622]  The Texas Family Code says the state owns the children.
[02:25:03.703 --> 02:25:04.823]  Actually says it, sir.
[02:25:05.404 --> 02:25:08.245]  And they're using the Social Security number as a federal ID number.
[02:25:08.305 --> 02:25:08.746]  Yes, sir.
[02:25:09.386 --> 02:25:10.267]  It's a cattle number.
[02:25:10.667 --> 02:25:13.949]  It's an animal identification, a property identification number.
[02:25:15.570 --> 02:25:16.150]  Unbelievable.
[02:25:16.971 --> 02:25:19.492]  I wanted to quickly just basically...
[02:25:20.683 --> 02:25:47.479]  Tell you that your videos have been waking people up, and I went and used information off your website, and I went to my local sheriff about three months ago with other patriots, like-minded people, and I showed them the videos of the gun confiscations, and he's a good sheriff, and I did this to kind of stab off any, if there is any type of catalyzing Reichstag event that takes place, I want our sheriff to know that gun confiscations and martial law is unconstitutional.
[02:25:48.382 --> 02:25:49.683]  And it was very effective, Alex.
[02:25:49.763 --> 02:25:52.005]  I want to thank you for the material that you put on your website.
[02:25:52.025 --> 02:25:52.586]  Well, that's right.
[02:25:52.606 --> 02:25:53.887]  We're social creatures.
[02:25:53.967 --> 02:25:55.749]  That's why we get along with dogs so well.
[02:25:56.409 --> 02:26:04.176]  And if they're mobbed all the time by patriots, they'll understand that's the majority view, and they'll balk when the bullet hits the bone.
[02:26:04.196 --> 02:26:04.817]  Thanks for the call.
[02:26:05.297 --> 02:26:05.917]  Good to hear from you.
[02:26:05.938 --> 02:26:06.658]  Keep it up.
[02:26:06.738 --> 02:26:07.559]  That's activism.
[02:26:07.599 --> 02:26:10.081]  Instead of whining and complaining, you're taking action.
[02:26:10.221 --> 02:26:11.002]  I salute you.
[02:26:11.983 --> 02:26:13.584]  Let's go ahead and talk to Fred in Indiana.
[02:26:13.624 --> 02:26:14.225]  Fred, go ahead.
[02:26:14.764 --> 02:26:19.227]  Hey Alex, somebody called in earlier and said that they wanted the Operation Endgame link.
[02:26:20.047 --> 02:26:20.307]  Yes.
[02:26:20.588 --> 02:26:27.172]  If you go to Google and you type in ice.gov space Operation Endgame, they'll give you a link right to a government website.
[02:26:27.192 --> 02:26:29.173]  You can download it, read it for yourself.
[02:26:29.193 --> 02:26:34.196]  I mean, I have articles posted that have links to it, but yeah, we should make that link itself just by itself.
[02:26:34.896 --> 02:26:40.420]  What Google searches you do to get the 40-page synopsis of Endgame Concentration Camp Plan?
[02:26:40.956 --> 02:26:47.681]  Yeah, you just type in ice.gov and then space operation endgame, and the very first link on there will be the government website.
[02:26:47.881 --> 02:26:51.063]  Ice.gov space operation endgame.
[02:26:51.303 --> 02:26:51.924]  Yeah, correct.
[02:26:52.584 --> 02:26:53.705]  All right, thank you very much.
[02:26:53.845 --> 02:26:54.366]  Anything else?
[02:26:54.866 --> 02:27:01.130]  Yeah, you know, I'm trying to wake people up every day, and I live in southern Indiana, and I'll tell you, it's really hard out here.
[02:27:01.771 --> 02:27:06.694]  But the biggest problem is people seem to think that, you know, we get some of the spoils of war.
[02:27:07.415 --> 02:27:08.936]  We don't get weapons contracts.
[02:27:09.436 --> 02:27:10.417]  We die in wars.
[02:27:11.297 --> 02:27:11.497]  No.
[02:27:11.697 --> 02:27:13.238]  We aren't enjoying the spoils of war.
[02:27:13.279 --> 02:27:14.219]  We aren't getting the oil.
[02:27:14.820 --> 02:27:16.241]  We're going to end up paying out.
[02:27:16.261 --> 02:27:18.783]  No, we're paying for the globalists to go get the spoils.
[02:27:18.803 --> 02:27:20.344]  We're not just not getting anything.
[02:27:20.544 --> 02:27:22.365]  We're paying to be part of this.
[02:27:22.385 --> 02:27:23.166]  All right.
[02:27:23.486 --> 02:27:24.387]  Thank you for what you do.
[02:27:24.427 --> 02:27:24.967]  Good job, man.
[02:27:25.247 --> 02:27:26.008]  Vaya con Dios.
[02:27:26.068 --> 02:27:26.488]  Thank you.
[02:27:26.528 --> 02:27:30.091]  We'll be right back with more calls, more news.
[02:27:30.111 --> 02:27:31.152]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:27:31.352 --> 02:27:32.413]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:27:36.076 --> 02:27:37.297]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.477 --> 02:27:38.978]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.987 --> 02:27:42.809]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.731 --> 02:27:49.774]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:27:49.974 --> 02:27:53.376]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:27:53.577 --> 02:27:57.019]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:27:57.293 --> 02:28:00.495]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:28:00.515 --> 02:28:06.039]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:28:06.059 --> 02:28:15.705]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:28:15.825 --> 02:28:17.206]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[02:28:17.226 --> 02:28:22.610]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead-on.
[02:28:23.112 --> 02:28:27.534]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:28:27.554 --> 02:28:28.994]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:28:29.154 --> 02:28:32.976]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[02:28:33.036 --> 02:28:33.916]  That toll-free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[02:28:45.871 --> 02:28:50.835]  Now you can bring Berkey purification power anywhere with the Sport Berkey filtration bottle.
[02:28:51.135 --> 02:28:53.397]  Ideal for sporting games, camping, or boating.
[02:28:53.457 --> 02:28:56.579]  Or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[02:28:56.619 --> 02:29:00.923]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[02:29:01.263 --> 02:29:04.265]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:29:04.585 --> 02:29:08.028]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[02:29:08.348 --> 02:29:17.694]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:29:17.954 --> 02:29:21.456]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:29:21.697 --> 02:29:28.821]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[02:29:29.061 --> 02:29:30.422]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.
[02:29:30.482 --> 02:29:32.263]  Get two for $70 by calling New Millennium at 888-

[02:29:45.745 --> 02:29:52.087]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:52.307 --> 02:29:57.328]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[02:29:57.648 --> 02:30:05.570]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:05.710 --> 02:30:12.752]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:12.972 --> 02:30:14.173]  There are no side effects.

[02:30:33.247 --> 02:30:34.267]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:30:34.307 --> 02:30:38.529]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:30:38.589 --> 02:30:40.530]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:00.150 --> 02:31:02.452]  All right, a lot of other key news items I want to go over.
[02:31:02.472 --> 02:31:04.933]  Tons of your phone calls we'll get to as well.
[02:31:05.433 --> 02:31:07.494]  Ron Paul could be calling in, popping in any time.
[02:31:07.514 --> 02:31:13.858]  He rarely has a scheduling problem in a committee and then can't show up, but he may not make it today.
[02:31:13.898 --> 02:31:16.460]  If not, he'll be on tomorrow or early next week.
[02:31:17.240 --> 02:31:20.622]  Congressman Ron Paul joins us, I guess, about every month and a half or so.
[02:31:21.162 --> 02:31:22.783]  He'd come on even more often than we ask.
[02:31:22.823 --> 02:31:23.524]  He's a great guy.
[02:31:23.964 --> 02:31:24.544]  Very, very busy.
[02:31:24.564 --> 02:31:27.646]  I have a lot of questions for him today, but we'll get those answered one way or another.
[02:31:29.702 --> 02:31:32.784]  Before I go back to your calls, let me just say this.
[02:31:33.465 --> 02:31:39.029]  If you hear my voice endorsing a product on this radio show, that means I believe in it.
[02:31:40.790 --> 02:31:48.055]  I don't want people to get in trouble when they hear some of the folks saying we've got get-out-of-debt systems that are 100% bulletproof.
[02:31:48.455 --> 02:31:49.436]  I don't know if that's the case.
[02:31:49.976 --> 02:31:51.137]  I'm just saying I don't endorse that.
[02:31:51.915 --> 02:31:56.416]  And I don't sell any magic products that are sure to cure you of this or sure to cure you of that.
[02:31:56.436 --> 02:32:02.498]  I don't want you to believe that and it not be the case something bad happened to you, and I morally have to say this.
[02:32:03.278 --> 02:32:04.558]  And you hear it all over talk radio.
[02:32:04.698 --> 02:32:05.958]  I'm not blaming anybody here.
[02:32:05.978 --> 02:32:11.880]  It's just that's the way the society is, and I'm just separating myself from it right here on air.
[02:32:13.400 --> 02:32:17.501]  I talk about real, made-in-America water filters that are top-of-the-line, industry standard.
[02:32:18.642 --> 02:32:19.662]  The water's full of poison.
[02:32:19.682 --> 02:32:20.222]  You need to get them.
[02:32:21.245 --> 02:32:29.292]  I talk about high-quality, made in America, organic soaps that cost a lot less money and aren't full of deadly toxins that are in your soaps and detergents you're using.
[02:32:29.732 --> 02:32:34.656]  I sell videos that I produce or films or books that I believe in that are powerful, that will wake people up.
[02:32:34.716 --> 02:32:35.777]  I'm about credibility.
[02:32:36.017 --> 02:32:37.058]  I'm about real issues.
[02:32:37.318 --> 02:32:39.340]  And let me just tell you about a sponsor that I do believe in.
[02:32:39.380 --> 02:32:42.122]  They've got a great free catalog they will send you.
[02:32:42.142 --> 02:32:47.106]  They've got a little starter pack that's very inexpensive if you want to get more than just the free catalog.
[02:32:48.050 --> 02:32:48.971]  And they're great folks.
[02:32:49.091 --> 02:32:50.873]  You need to give them a call.
[02:32:51.193 --> 02:32:58.039]  They have 100% unconditional guarantee, all natural, triple concentrated, factory direct, factory owned, and operated since 1947.
[02:32:58.219 --> 02:33:01.842]  They're 59 years old, ladies and gentlemen, almost 60 years.
[02:33:02.282 --> 02:33:10.649]  Earth-friendly, pure soaps for bathing, laundry, kitchen, up to 85% cash savings for your one year through bulk packaging.
[02:33:11.270 --> 02:33:13.472]  Rated best in the world by everybody.
[02:33:14.614 --> 02:33:24.401]  Twice as good, and that's a group that everybody's a consumer group, twice as good as anything you have ever used before, made in America.
[02:33:24.421 --> 02:33:25.943]  I mean, I really love this soap.
[02:33:28.619 --> 02:33:33.363]  It's made by Americans for Americans, recommended by health care professionals.
[02:33:33.743 --> 02:33:37.326]  Try pure soap, laundry soap, dish soap, shampoo.
[02:33:37.426 --> 02:33:39.888]  They guarantee you will never use anything else.
[02:33:39.968 --> 02:33:40.729]  You will love it.
[02:33:41.369 --> 02:33:45.453]  My wife just actually was like, you gave all of it because we got another year's supply of free from it.
[02:33:45.473 --> 02:33:46.273]  She's like, you gave that away?
[02:33:46.313 --> 02:33:46.734]  I want that.
[02:33:47.194 --> 02:33:49.695]  She's like, okay, give it all away, because she just bought some more.
[02:33:49.735 --> 02:33:57.079]  But if cleanliness is next to goodliness and godliness, that puts us very, very in good company.
[02:33:57.699 --> 02:34:02.102]  Marty Shackton, the owner, says, stop the use of polluting detergents as well.
[02:34:03.202 --> 02:34:06.104]  Folks, you really need to give them a call.
[02:34:06.184 --> 02:34:06.565]  It's 1-800-340-7091.
[02:34:06.585 --> 02:34:06.765]  1-800-340-7091.
[02:34:06.845 --> 02:34:11.808]  Or go to InfoAwards.com.
[02:34:12.188 --> 02:34:19.233]  On the left-hand side, there's a big banner over to the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company, and you can look at all the different specials and different packages.
[02:34:19.553 --> 02:34:24.937]  Four-year supplies, two-year supplies, one-year supplies, month supplies, starter packs, free catalogs, 800-340-7091.
[02:34:24.957 --> 02:34:25.557]  Or CalBendPureSoap.com.
[02:34:25.898 --> 02:34:26.838]  That's C-A-L-B-E-N PureSoap.com.
[02:34:32.942 --> 02:34:35.523]  Try pure soap once, and I guarantee you'll never try anything else.
[02:34:35.563 --> 02:34:37.304]  That's their little motto and slogan.
[02:34:37.384 --> 02:34:46.329]  And it's just, you know, and a lot of you are used to that chemical smell, that abrasiveness, and if you don't wash all of it out from under your arms, it'll chap you and burn.
[02:34:47.547 --> 02:34:54.253]  And it feels bad if you get it on your mucous membrane, up your nose or something.
[02:34:54.673 --> 02:35:03.440]  I mean, I just sit there and lather up with their bar soap and their shampoo, and it gets in your eyes and it doesn't burn because it's made out of citrus and out of vegetable oil.
[02:35:03.520 --> 02:35:06.382]  I mean, it's natural, and it's amazing.
[02:35:07.323 --> 02:35:08.984]  And I gave a bunch of it to the staff up here.
[02:35:09.004 --> 02:35:09.885]  Again, a big year's supply.
[02:35:09.945 --> 02:35:13.168]  I busted it up for them, and they come back and go, man, I thought you were kidding about that.
[02:35:13.188 --> 02:35:14.208]  This stuff's incredible.
[02:35:14.228 --> 02:35:14.669]  I use it for...
[02:35:15.470 --> 02:35:16.330]  Look, they got it all.
[02:35:16.350 --> 02:35:17.051]  Just give them a call.
[02:35:17.351 --> 02:35:24.573]  And it won't make you live forever, and it won't heal you, and it won't make you sprout wings and fly to the moon and back, and it won't make you a billionaire overnight.
[02:35:24.633 --> 02:35:27.834]  It's not like a magic prayer cloth from Robert Tilton.
[02:35:28.594 --> 02:35:31.255]  But it's good, and it's made in Americas, and you save money.
[02:35:32.396 --> 02:35:33.236]  So do what you want.
[02:35:33.876 --> 02:35:35.397]  Word of the wise is sufficient.
[02:35:36.237 --> 02:35:36.637]  All right.
[02:35:36.917 --> 02:35:39.758]  Let's go back to the calls, and we'll go back into the news.
[02:35:40.498 --> 02:35:42.419]  And up next is Mark in Virginia.
[02:35:42.459 --> 02:35:43.219]  Mark, you're on the air.
[02:35:44.420 --> 02:35:44.940]  Las Vegas.
[02:35:45.919 --> 02:35:48.161]  Okay, I just can't get anything straight today.
[02:35:48.201 --> 02:35:49.723]  Go ahead, Mark, in Las Vegas.
[02:35:50.344 --> 02:35:50.984]  Hello, sir.
[02:35:51.044 --> 02:35:53.667]  Prison Planet TV subscriber, former Marine.
[02:35:53.687 --> 02:35:57.110]  I want to say simple fly to all my fellow Marines that are listening.
[02:35:57.891 --> 02:36:01.575]  You know, I, myself, actually, I'm an anarchist.
[02:36:02.396 --> 02:36:09.723]  And contrary to a lot of popular beliefs about anarchy, we don't support chaos and disorder and
[02:36:10.362 --> 02:36:17.168]  Well, some branches, nihilistic anarchists do, or block anarchists do, and we had one of those calls last hour.
[02:36:17.788 --> 02:36:22.953]  Yeah, you know, people who support, basically, the idea that might makes right.
[02:36:23.113 --> 02:36:26.716]  That's totally contrary to the real principles of anarchy.
[02:36:27.136 --> 02:36:34.142]  In fact, yeah, as one of the previous calls mentioned, it is about upholding an objective law, i.e.
[02:36:34.182 --> 02:36:36.384]  the principle of non-aggression.
[02:36:37.394 --> 02:36:40.696]  You look at the Bill of Rights, which you say you support, and I agree with you there.
[02:36:40.716 --> 02:36:57.883]  I think the ideals enshrined in the Bill of Rights are outstanding, but the real question is, I think, is how do we, when you have a state that has a monopoly on enforcing the Bill of Rights, when the state has a monopoly on the use of force, how do we actually enforce the Bill of Rights?
[02:36:58.451 --> 02:37:06.145]  Oh, sir, listen, government needs to be reduced by 95%, and I have a lot of libertarian views, or an article, or however you pronounce it.
[02:37:07.327 --> 02:37:08.428]  But at the same time...
[02:37:10.081 --> 02:37:14.223]  I'm just telling you, I've been around what you'd call the hardcore anarchists, and they're a bunch of dirt balls.
[02:37:14.703 --> 02:37:28.888]  I'm not saying that there aren't a lot of good people that have these anarchist views, and I'm not saying that we've gotten so far to the other extreme of big centralized government that it isn't bad to strive for something closer to anarchy.
[02:37:28.948 --> 02:37:30.349]  I mean, the real political spectrum...
[02:37:31.127 --> 02:37:41.133]  Is anarchy on one end and total command and control slavery on the other, and the republic form of government is in the middle of that political spectrum, and that's what I'm trying to achieve.
[02:37:41.773 --> 02:37:51.479]  I'll tell you, for me, what I was reading, a man, he's passed away by the name of Murray Rothbard, and then I went from him to reading Leisner, Spooner, and Roy Child.
[02:37:51.799 --> 02:37:55.001]  And it was Roy Child, he passed away several years ago, too.
[02:37:55.401 --> 02:37:59.684]  He had written an open letter to Ayn Rand, and after I got done reading his letter to Ayn Rand...
[02:38:00.310 --> 02:38:03.452]  That pushed me over the edge towards anarchy.
[02:38:03.492 --> 02:38:18.003]  Well, by the way, the outgoing head of the, or now the retired head of the Federal Reserve, was a libertarian-slash-anarchist and anti-New World Order, and then they bought him off, and his name was Alan Greenspan, and he wrote essays published in a book by and ran a compendium.
[02:38:19.264 --> 02:38:20.265]  You ever read those?
[02:38:20.285 --> 02:38:22.867]  Yeah, yeah, I've read some of his writings.
[02:38:22.907 --> 02:38:24.028]  I'm not really a Randian.
[02:38:24.208 --> 02:38:25.989]  Like I was saying, I'm more of a Rothbardian person.
[02:38:26.577 --> 02:38:31.581]  And Roy Childs, who actually had written a letter kind of repudiating Randianism.
[02:38:31.661 --> 02:38:36.524]  Well, I'm what you call somebody who follows Leviticus and God's law.
[02:38:37.745 --> 02:38:41.128]  Now, this is my last point I just wanted to bring up.
[02:38:42.028 --> 02:38:53.677]  People who think that we have no hope, you know, Alex, I tell you, as evil has waxed worse and worse, clearly God has raised up a standard
[02:38:54.025 --> 02:39:04.132]  And just think, ten years ago, imagine a former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury like Paul Craig Roberts or a man like Ray McGovern talking about government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:39:05.313 --> 02:39:10.936]  So clearly, more and more people, prominent people as well, are speaking out.
[02:39:11.297 --> 02:39:20.403]  And I think that as evil gets worse and worse, I think more and more... Morgan Reynolds, Stephen Jones, Ron Paul, the list goes on and on.
[02:39:21.676 --> 02:39:21.876]  Yes.
[02:39:22.116 --> 02:39:24.158]  So I think we definitely have hope, Alex.
[02:39:25.419 --> 02:39:25.759]  I hear you.
[02:39:25.779 --> 02:39:26.860]  I appreciate the call.
[02:39:27.741 --> 02:39:29.923]  Here's an example of where you could say I'm an anarchist.
[02:39:31.164 --> 02:39:35.608]  I believe at the base level in the death penalty.
[02:39:36.268 --> 02:39:40.812]  I think somebody who goes into a little old lady's house and stabs her five times and
[02:39:41.560 --> 02:39:41.840]  I think?
[02:40:04.861 --> 02:40:06.163]  But I'm against the death penalty.
[02:40:06.183 --> 02:40:07.144]  You go, what does that mean?
[02:40:07.164 --> 02:40:08.346]  You're for it, but you're against it.
[02:40:08.366 --> 02:40:10.709]  You know, I voted for the war before I voted against it.
[02:40:11.049 --> 02:40:17.117]  Well, no, I am for that if we had a government that was lawful and a constitutional and wasn't manifestly criminal.
[02:40:17.518 --> 02:40:21.703]  When you learn from DNA testing that around a third of the people on death row are completely innocent.
[02:40:22.535 --> 02:40:31.923]  When you learn that the Houston Crime Lab, the Dallas Crime Lab, I'm talking about Texas, the Tulia Crime Lab, the El Paso Crime Lab, all of them, I mean, admittedly, have been caught.
[02:40:32.584 --> 02:40:34.405]  No one who went through there was found innocent.
[02:40:34.685 --> 02:40:35.446]  Everyone was guilty.
[02:40:35.486 --> 02:40:40.010]  They didn't even try to do DNA checks or ballistics checks.
[02:40:41.249 --> 02:40:43.771]  I mean, these guys are so evil and so lazy.
[02:40:44.672 --> 02:40:46.534]  It was thousands of times in the Houston Crime Lab.
[02:40:46.554 --> 02:40:47.374]  The police have admitted it.
[02:40:47.635 --> 02:40:48.916]  They just framed everyone.
[02:40:49.216 --> 02:40:50.177]  Oh, we won't even test that.
[02:40:50.217 --> 02:40:51.018]  He's already got a rap.
[02:40:51.058 --> 02:40:51.918]  I'm sure he's guilty.
[02:40:52.199 --> 02:40:53.179]  I'll give him the death penalty.
[02:40:53.420 --> 02:40:54.581]  I'll send him to life for prison.
[02:40:54.801 --> 02:40:56.162]  I mean, how do you do that?
[02:40:56.202 --> 02:41:07.412]  How do you just not have the morals of, I've got a uniform, or I work at the forensics lab at the Houston Crime Lab, or I'm the Dallas Police Department, and I throw bags of chalk in cars to ask if officers are seized.
[02:41:07.472 --> 02:41:08.693]  I mean, you guys are criminals.
[02:41:11.087 --> 02:41:16.129]  So the government is now so criminal that you cannot have a death penalty.
[02:41:16.169 --> 02:41:25.914]  Now, when some scumbags plead guilty and they dig up five kids in their backyard, I mean, I have a feeling of pleasure when I hear they finally killed the sacks of maggots.
[02:41:26.874 --> 02:41:34.758]  But at the same time, though, I know that it's better that ten guilty men go free than one man whose innocence would be behind bars or be killed.
[02:41:35.322 --> 02:41:37.624]  And there's this argument now that, no, that's not the case.
[02:41:37.664 --> 02:41:53.954]  Well, history has shown when you get that kind of attitude, the biggest criminals and the people that are organized to engage in killing 60 million, 40 million, 20 million, that's what dictators last century were killing, 60 mil in China, 50 mil in Russia, 20, 30 mil, depending on what numbers you look at in Germany.
[02:41:53.974 --> 02:41:57.837]  I mean, you start with 10 million, 5 million here, 100,000 there, 400,000 here, 800,000 there, Rwanda, all of it, a million and a half here.
[02:42:01.297 --> 02:42:06.759]  When you start, you know, Madeline Albright going, well, yeah, 700,000 dead Iraqi kids, but it's a good price to pay.
[02:42:07.020 --> 02:42:07.740]  That's sick!
[02:42:10.621 --> 02:42:12.662]  That little goblin needs to be arrested.
[02:42:13.602 --> 02:42:15.383]  I mean, these are serial killer type statements.
[02:42:15.403 --> 02:42:19.705]  Well, we've got to fight the terrorists that might kill us, or we've got to torture children in front of their parents.
[02:42:19.745 --> 02:42:22.546]  I mean, that's becoming the devil in the name of fighting the devil.
[02:42:22.786 --> 02:42:26.088]  When you dance with the devil, he doesn't change, you change, the old cliche goes.
[02:42:28.169 --> 02:42:29.830]  Okay, we're going to have to get him up next week.
[02:42:29.850 --> 02:42:31.412]  We've got him for five minutes right now.
[02:42:31.432 --> 02:42:33.293]  I twisted his arm to get him on.
[02:42:33.593 --> 02:42:36.455]  Just the listeners battered me to get him on, so I lobbied him.
[02:42:36.856 --> 02:42:37.776]  He's such a great American.
[02:42:37.796 --> 02:42:38.677]  We've got him five minutes.
[02:42:39.017 --> 02:42:41.459]  Congressman, will you join me again next week for the customary 20?
[02:42:41.559 --> 02:42:44.181]  We'll do everything possible to do it.
[02:42:45.783 --> 02:42:47.405]  Give you almost an absolute.
[02:42:47.745 --> 02:42:51.928]  Well, I'm one of the few people that's in the same... I mean, I turned down ten interviews this week.
[02:42:52.208 --> 02:42:53.009]  I'm so burnt out.
[02:42:53.029 --> 02:42:56.112]  So I understand, sir, but we need you as one of our champions.
[02:42:56.452 --> 02:42:58.874]  You wrote an article about the end of dollar hegemony.
[02:42:58.914 --> 02:43:00.175]  Give us your take on it, Congressman.
[02:43:00.675 --> 02:43:04.278]  Well, this whole thing that I talk about is the dollar.
[02:43:04.318 --> 02:43:06.420]  You know I've been interested in monetary policy.
[02:43:07.240 --> 02:43:11.484]  And the fact that we as a nation get to print the world currency...
[02:43:12.111 --> 02:43:17.832]  It's a big advantage, but eventually it'll be a major disadvantage when the people lose trust in the dollar.
[02:43:17.952 --> 02:43:20.653]  Well, now they're coming back with that money and buying up infrastructure.
[02:43:20.673 --> 02:43:22.473]  More than half the infrastructure now far and out.
[02:43:22.513 --> 02:43:24.514]  Is that a national security threat?
[02:43:24.534 --> 02:43:25.454]  Yeah, this is the whole thing.
[02:43:25.514 --> 02:43:26.574]  We get to print the money.
[02:43:26.714 --> 02:43:27.575]  They accept it.
[02:43:27.615 --> 02:43:28.995]  We buy goods and services.
[02:43:29.055 --> 02:43:31.115]  They come in, but they end up holding our dollars.
[02:43:31.655 --> 02:43:38.497]  So they have an interest in the cycling of this money because they don't want to crash the dollar because they hold so many of them.
[02:43:38.951 --> 02:43:45.437]  So they then turn around and start buying up our infrastructure, and I think part of this port bid has something to do with it.
[02:43:45.798 --> 02:43:48.060]  But they're ending up with the manufacturing jobs.
[02:43:48.160 --> 02:43:51.883]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Congressman, says that's what globalism is designed to do.
[02:43:51.943 --> 02:43:52.724]  It's not free market.
[02:43:55.006 --> 02:44:03.134]  The way it is designed today, it's a type of fascist globalism which doesn't have anything to do with the free market.
[02:44:03.798 --> 02:44:07.799]  And it's the controls that are built in place with all these international agreements.
[02:44:07.899 --> 02:44:20.863]  I happen to think that we should be allowed to trade with people and buy goods from other people, but not under the system that is devised under the UN, the WTO, and NAFTA, and all these other groups.
[02:44:20.883 --> 02:44:26.025]  There's an article, sir, that Congress is going to capitulate and has been told to sit down and shut up, and this deal is going to go through.
[02:44:26.745 --> 02:44:28.105]  I think it's going to go through.
[02:44:28.125 --> 02:44:33.407]  I think they're going to window dress it, say they've checked everything and changed a few things
[02:44:33.914 --> 02:44:34.955]  It's probably going to go through.
[02:44:35.375 --> 02:44:39.718]  It probably will contribute to the Republicans' failure in the next election.
[02:44:39.738 --> 02:44:46.163]  Sir, just real quickly, the Treasury Secretary got a $1,150,000,000 deal out of it.
[02:44:46.383 --> 02:44:50.225]  He sat on the board that waived the 45-day review and signed it over.
[02:44:50.586 --> 02:44:54.809]  One of their chief executives at UAE is going to run all port security in the country.
[02:44:54.829 --> 02:44:57.791]  Can you speak to the illegality?
[02:44:59.051 --> 02:44:59.272]  Well...
[02:45:00.451 --> 02:45:12.456]  It certainly is vague on some people's mind, but the whole fact that we can turn such a contract over to a foreign government just baffles, I guess, about everybody.
[02:45:12.876 --> 02:45:16.798]  And, you know, in many ways this is a good event because it's awakened the American people.
[02:45:16.818 --> 02:45:24.601]  A lot of people wanted to give the President the benefit of the doubt on everything, whether it's going to war or international trade agreements.
[02:45:25.126 --> 02:45:30.448]  At least this has awakened a lot of people, and I think this is going to serve as a benefit.
[02:45:31.068 --> 02:45:39.891]  Although, like we say, they're likely to pull this deal off, but the American people are awakened now, and I think there's going to be a payback period in the election.
[02:45:39.951 --> 02:45:41.371]  Congressman, you're in Texas.
[02:45:41.411 --> 02:45:46.753]  You know the Spanish company Centra is literally being seeded most of the Texas and local roads.
[02:45:46.993 --> 02:45:48.773]  That dwarfs this port deal.
[02:45:49.674 --> 02:45:53.715]  It is, and I'm sure there'll be more around once we discover them.
[02:45:55.288 --> 02:45:57.951]  Can you comment on the handover of roads and water districts?
[02:46:00.253 --> 02:46:00.593]  Pardon me?
[02:46:02.395 --> 02:46:11.784]  Can you comment on the handover of key infrastructure like roads and prisons and Bush's executive order from 1992 directing it?
[02:46:13.505 --> 02:46:20.452]  Well, that is the trend, and it certainly is a big deal in Texas on the road business, on that interstate road that they're planning.
[02:46:21.300 --> 02:46:23.701]  And all the land being confiscated under eminent domain.
[02:46:23.801 --> 02:46:25.621]  I've only got two more questions in the last two minutes.
[02:46:25.641 --> 02:46:26.601]  We'll let you go, Congressman.
[02:46:26.621 --> 02:46:27.902]  Get into your next committee meeting.
[02:46:27.942 --> 02:46:28.882]  We appreciate the time.
[02:46:29.842 --> 02:46:32.063]  They're about to reauthorize the Patriot Act.
[02:46:32.323 --> 02:46:32.943]  What does that mean?
[02:46:32.983 --> 02:46:39.085]  Number two, Will Spector's rider creating a national police force with arrestable offenses for any reason.
[02:46:39.385 --> 02:46:40.485]  Is that going to be passed?
[02:46:40.705 --> 02:46:43.246]  It's going to be passed, tragically.
[02:46:44.006 --> 02:46:47.727]  Feingold stood firm and for a while held there.
[02:46:47.787 --> 02:46:49.988]  And we had a few Republicans, but they finally caved in.
[02:46:50.834 --> 02:47:04.599]  They had a few token changes, which will mean nothing, and under the President's system, he just ignores what he doesn't like anyway, and we didn't vote on it this week and won't, but we'll vote on it next week, and that will conclude it, unfortunately.
[02:47:04.799 --> 02:47:08.121]  Can you comment on the particular National Police Force?
[02:47:08.181 --> 02:47:09.861]  I mean, that blows the Tenth Amendment away.
[02:47:11.242 --> 02:47:16.424]  Well, that's for darn sure, and this is the beginning of it, and you can be assured that
[02:47:16.860 --> 02:47:25.062]  That, plus all the other activities under the United Nations, UN taxes and police forces and the whole works, the idea of sovereignty is just about dead.
[02:47:25.962 --> 02:47:33.803]  What about all of the open talk of the executive being above the law, and that even if you didn't pass the Patriot Act, Bush would enforce it?
[02:47:33.843 --> 02:47:34.443]  What do you call that?
[02:47:34.483 --> 02:47:35.424]  Is that called dictatorship?
[02:47:36.044 --> 02:47:37.384]  Well, it's getting close to it.
[02:47:38.404 --> 02:47:41.885]  It's called usurpation of power, and it's done...
[02:47:42.863 --> 02:47:46.744]  In many ways, with Congress just going along because they're sound asleep.
[02:47:47.504 --> 02:47:51.745]  And this certainly is an attack on our Constitution and on our freedoms.
[02:47:51.965 --> 02:47:54.086]  Anything positive to report in the last 30 seconds?
[02:47:54.586 --> 02:47:56.686]  Last 30 seconds worth of positive things?
[02:47:57.467 --> 02:47:59.847]  Well, we keep plugging along with our Liberty Committee.
[02:47:59.887 --> 02:48:10.790]  We had a meeting today with a general, a retired general, William Odom, who is a real patriot, although he has been in the Reagan administration and in the establishment
[02:48:11.260 --> 02:48:19.643]  He condemns our foreign policies, thinks it's the stupidest thing ever, and he's up here trying to preach a different message and wake up a few Republicans.
[02:48:19.663 --> 02:48:24.065]  Could we see impeachment of Bush if the Democrats take the Congress in the midterm?
[02:48:24.585 --> 02:48:25.805]  I predict that would happen.
[02:48:27.106 --> 02:48:30.087]  And you think Bush is carrying out an action that will cause that?
[02:48:30.647 --> 02:48:33.808]  I think he has numerous things that the Democrats, if they get a chance...
[02:48:34.493 --> 02:48:38.961]  Not only will they be after for that, but it will be payback for the Clinton impeachment.
[02:48:39.001 --> 02:48:39.321]  All right.
[02:48:39.361 --> 02:48:41.004]  Look forward to speaking to you next week, sir.
[02:48:41.124 --> 02:48:41.485]  Thank you.
[02:48:42.266 --> 02:48:42.867]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:45.632 --> 02:48:47.134]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.314 --> 02:48:50.398]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.538 --> 02:48:54.422]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.482 --> 02:48:58.707]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:48:59.067 --> 02:49:02.831]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:02.972 --> 02:49:04.794]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.935 --> 02:49:13.022]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.182 --> 02:49:16.225]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:16.405 --> 02:49:19.268]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:19.749 --> 02:49:25.875]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.395 --> 02:49:27.116]  We're good to go.
[02:49:27.136 --> 02:49:27.616]  We're good to go.
[02:49:46.810 --> 02:49:58.083]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[02:49:58.304 --> 02:50:01.788]  The revolutionary Berkey Life removes pathogenic bacteria.
[02:50:02.068 --> 02:50:02.508]  We're good to go.
[02:50:23.180 --> 02:50:23.620]  We're good to go.
[02:50:23.660 --> 02:50:24.281]  We're good to go.
[02:50:24.341 --> 02:50:25.002]  We're good to go.
[02:50:46.061 --> 02:50:51.990]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:50:52.210 --> 02:50:54.473]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[02:50:54.654 --> 02:51:01.023]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[02:51:01.303 --> 02:51:02.004]  We're good to go.
[02:51:21.761 --> 02:51:22.202]  We're good to go.
[02:51:46.448 --> 02:51:49.189]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:51:49.209 --> 02:51:53.129]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:54.310 --> 02:51:58.010]  In the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, waging war on corruption.
[02:51:58.030 --> 02:51:59.290]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:51:59.310 --> 02:52:00.231]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:52:00.691 --> 02:52:03.651]  Central, I'm very thankful to all our affiliates, you the listeners and the sponsors.
[02:52:04.011 --> 02:52:05.752]  Take a few final calls here at the NAB Jam.
[02:52:05.792 --> 02:52:06.772]  A few more articles in.
[02:52:08.052 --> 02:52:09.072]  I know what happened with Ron Paul.
[02:52:09.092 --> 02:52:09.992]  He was late in that meeting.
[02:52:10.012 --> 02:52:10.813]  He had another one coming up.
[02:52:10.853 --> 02:52:12.533]  He was trying to eat lunch in about two minutes.
[02:52:13.180 --> 02:52:15.602]  And his secretary put him on quick, because I know that sound.
[02:52:15.662 --> 02:52:17.003]  That's when you don't finish eating.
[02:52:17.423 --> 02:52:19.685]  Poor guy trying to eat in five minutes, I guarantee you.
[02:52:20.065 --> 02:52:20.805]  That's happened to me before.
[02:52:20.846 --> 02:52:22.427]  Trying to eat during a three-minute break and then coming back.
[02:52:25.008 --> 02:52:26.389]  But he'll be back with us next week.
[02:52:26.850 --> 02:52:28.191]  And we'll have him on for a couple segments.
[02:52:28.311 --> 02:52:29.952]  Maybe I'll twist his arm and get him on for a full hour.
[02:52:30.012 --> 02:52:30.352]  Who knows?
[02:52:30.652 --> 02:52:33.695]  We do that about once a year, but we have him on almost every month for about 20 minutes.
[02:52:36.096 --> 02:52:41.020]  And we will now go ahead and take some phone calls.
[02:52:42.367 --> 02:52:46.635]  Let's go ahead now and talk to James in Maryland.
[02:52:46.675 --> 02:52:47.617]  Quickly, James, go ahead.
[02:52:47.637 --> 02:52:53.567]  Yes, Alex, could you please talk a little bit about the National ID card and when?
[02:52:54.453 --> 02:52:56.614]  That's mandatory for the public.
[02:52:56.834 --> 02:53:00.315]  That's mandatory now, but they're very covert about it in the federal laws.
[02:53:00.335 --> 02:53:10.019]  Your state driver's license is under federal standardization with biometrics on it, and that was passed about eight months ago by the Congress and signed by the President.
[02:53:10.039 --> 02:53:11.660]  It's called the Real ID Act.
[02:53:13.709 --> 02:53:16.853]  And then there'll be a national sales tax pushed by Neil Board's federal program.
[02:53:16.873 --> 02:53:18.856]  They're going to keep the income tax on top of it.
[02:53:19.076 --> 02:53:24.082]  You'll swipe the card to prove that you're in the, quote, bracket of the flat tax, and it'll track every purchase you make.
[02:53:25.084 --> 02:53:30.531]  And are they going to move from state licenses to strictly the...
[02:53:31.482 --> 02:53:32.563]  The national ID card?
[02:53:32.643 --> 02:53:39.087]  Well, I mean, it's just like you can have a state license plate that's got a deer on it.
[02:53:39.127 --> 02:53:40.528]  It's still a state license plate.
[02:53:40.548 --> 02:53:42.889]  Well, it's a federal ID card, sir.
[02:53:43.049 --> 02:53:45.070]  Federally run, federal computers, federal.
[02:53:45.271 --> 02:53:47.132]  It's the law, but it'll still say Texas.
[02:53:48.092 --> 02:53:51.594]  So ten years into it, you'll argue with your neighbor and they'll say it in the national ID card.
[02:53:53.356 --> 02:53:55.097]  It's just got a different label on it.
[02:53:55.117 --> 02:53:58.078]  It's like you've got a Ford pickup truck that's got a different paint job.
[02:53:59.599 --> 02:54:00.540]  Still a Ford pickup truck.
[02:54:01.727 --> 02:54:02.127]  Alrighty.
[02:54:02.207 --> 02:54:04.949]  Well, is there a computer chip in this?
[02:54:06.350 --> 02:54:07.851]  Well, there's three mandates under it.
[02:54:08.111 --> 02:54:09.032]  And they passed the law.
[02:54:09.092 --> 02:54:09.973]  Most states already have it.
[02:54:10.013 --> 02:54:10.953]  Now it's being implemented.
[02:54:11.454 --> 02:54:12.975]  By 08, it has to be in every one of them.
[02:54:12.995 --> 02:54:14.436]  There's only a few that didn't to begin with.
[02:54:14.716 --> 02:54:17.598]  Thumbprint, digital photo, face scan, and smart chip.
[02:54:17.638 --> 02:54:17.998]  Yes, sir.
[02:54:18.018 --> 02:54:18.579]  Thanks for the call.
[02:54:19.359 --> 02:54:20.860]  Texas had this in 93, by the way.
[02:54:20.880 --> 02:54:23.802]  It's in my first film, America Showed by Design, and I get arrested protesting it.
[02:54:24.082 --> 02:54:26.404]  We laid out their entire plan off executive orders in the film.
[02:54:27.045 --> 02:54:28.186]  That's why we know what they're going to do.
[02:54:28.226 --> 02:54:29.528]  We just have their own battle plan.
[02:54:30.069 --> 02:54:31.411]  How does he know so much?
[02:54:31.431 --> 02:54:32.152]  Because they told us.
[02:54:33.054 --> 02:54:34.075]  Elias in Michigan.
[02:54:34.115 --> 02:54:35.017]  Elias, go ahead.
[02:54:35.297 --> 02:54:39.524]  Hey, will you agree then that all down through history and all parts of the world
[02:54:40.683 --> 02:54:43.746]  Governments have become instruments of oppression.
[02:54:43.906 --> 02:54:46.248]  No matter how they started, they're benign.
[02:54:46.408 --> 02:54:50.771]  Like tumors, they start benign, but then they proceed to cancerous.
[02:54:50.851 --> 02:54:55.775]  Because people get decadent and because the people are evil and we've got to restrict and reduce government.
[02:54:55.835 --> 02:54:56.936]  What is the answer to this?
[02:54:57.036 --> 02:54:58.257]  You're going to have a government.
[02:54:58.317 --> 02:55:02.721]  Communism doesn't exist in anything but ants and bees and other communal insects.
[02:55:03.081 --> 02:55:06.344]  And anarchy doesn't exist in more than three people.
[02:55:06.624 --> 02:55:07.845]  Somebody's going to be the boss.
[02:55:07.885 --> 02:55:08.466]  Thanks for the call.
[02:55:09.046 --> 02:55:15.090]  So we better have a government that is built to protect our liberties and built to protect us from bad governments.
[02:55:15.631 --> 02:55:17.012]  And it isn't going to be perfect either.
[02:55:17.272 --> 02:55:19.554]  I don't know what the anarchists can't figure out about that.
[02:55:19.774 --> 02:55:21.095]  We'll have a big debate about it, okay?
[02:55:21.395 --> 02:55:22.956]  Adam and Casey, last caller.
[02:55:22.976 --> 02:55:23.336]  Yes.
[02:55:23.917 --> 02:55:24.277]  Alex.
[02:55:24.757 --> 02:55:24.857]  Yes.
[02:55:24.877 --> 02:55:29.221]  I've been trying to call for months, and when you get busy at work sometimes, you just don't get a chance to do it.
[02:55:29.241 --> 02:55:29.581]  I understand.
[02:55:29.601 --> 02:55:29.941]  You're on.
[02:55:29.961 --> 02:55:30.541]  You've got a minute.
[02:55:30.942 --> 02:55:33.484]  And I found a better way to approach people with this.
[02:55:33.584 --> 02:55:38.207]  I saw on your website, I saw the Sorry We Missed You card sort of in the humor section.
[02:55:38.886 --> 02:55:43.969]  You can check off the boxes saying, you know, FEMA was here or Homeland Security was here at your door.
[02:55:44.589 --> 02:55:48.031]  I've printed up a bunch of those on cardstock and I hand them out everywhere I can.
[02:55:48.271 --> 02:55:51.533]  And the funny approach that seems to get people more than anything else.
[02:55:51.733 --> 02:55:52.633]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:55:52.673 --> 02:55:53.954]  So you're having an effect.
[02:55:54.274 --> 02:55:56.395]  And they take it home and it's got your website on it.
[02:55:56.535 --> 02:56:02.819]  So as much as handing out videos and everything else, I find that the humor approach is actually working a lot better than anything else.
[02:56:03.638 --> 02:56:04.638]  Well, good job, Adam.
[02:56:04.658 --> 02:56:05.579]  What else is on your mind?
[02:56:05.859 --> 02:56:08.920]  Well, the anarchy thing, too, is always funny, too.
[02:56:08.940 --> 02:56:09.721]  That popped up today.
[02:56:09.741 --> 02:56:16.964]  I always kind of figure that the trendy anarchists pretty much can't decide if they want to throw a rock through the Starbucks window or go in and get a Frappuccino, it seems.
[02:56:17.584 --> 02:56:18.905]  All right, Adam.
[02:56:18.945 --> 02:56:19.685]  Good to hear from you.
[02:56:20.045 --> 02:56:20.906]  We're out of time.
[02:56:21.506 --> 02:56:22.647]  God bless you all.
