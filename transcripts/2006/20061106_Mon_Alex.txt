[00:00:05.643 --> 00:00:09.805]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover Ups.
[00:00:10.465 --> 00:00:11.285]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.046 --> 00:00:12.946]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.606 --> 00:00:17.368]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.788 --> 00:00:21.910]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.692 --> 00:00:27.692]  It is November 6, 2006.
[00:00:32.572 --> 00:00:35.453]  Tomorrow is the big midterm elections.
[00:00:39.114 --> 00:00:42.736]  We're going to have wide open phones for the entire broadcast.
[00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:46.957]  We do have Steve Watson with a 30 minute report at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:00:46.977 --> 00:00:52.899]  The Feds are getting ready to release a new video supposedly showing a plane hitting the Pentagon.
[00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:01.182]  Remember I predicted a few months ago, it wasn't very hard to do, that there was a very great probability
[00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:14.788]  But they were releasing a new smudged video that did not show a plane to actually heighten the debate and to make the Pentagon strike the central issue on which 9-11 truth hinges.
[00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:23.216]  And they may release this new video and it may just be a little more clear and then heighten the debate.
[00:01:23.556 --> 00:01:27.879]  There could be another video that then is a little more clear and heightens the debate.
[00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:33.862]  And then finally the crisp, clear video being released, whether it's real or not.
[00:01:35.503 --> 00:01:39.385]  I've seen shy-op written on the Pentagon since day one.
[00:01:40.211 --> 00:01:42.372]  But we're going to suspend discussion of that.
[00:01:42.412 --> 00:01:45.915]  You're welcome to call in about it, but we'll be discussing it with Steve Watson.
[00:01:45.935 --> 00:01:51.078]  He's written a detailed report at Infowars.net in an hour and a half from now.
[00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.091]  Of course, we're witnessing October surprises.
[00:01:56.771 --> 00:02:11.415]  Not only did they have the Saddam verdict of death, death, death, hanged by the neck until dead announced yesterday, less than 48 hours before the kickoff of Election Day,
[00:02:12.472 --> 00:02:41.117]  But Republicans admit, and it's in fully seven different newspapers that I've seen, that they're having harassing computerized phone calls made, posing as the opposition candidates, posing as the Democrats, and they'll call someone three times in a row, and I've listened to some of the ads, they're very obnoxious, it's meant to make the Democrats sound stupid, and in the past they did these dirty tricks, but now, now it's out in the open.
[00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:43.551]  Like everything else seems to be.
[00:02:43.651 --> 00:02:46.852]  So, we'll be discussing that little October surprise.
[00:02:47.372 --> 00:02:49.292]  And listen, today is the key day.
[00:02:50.173 --> 00:02:51.273]  You could see anything.
[00:02:51.293 --> 00:02:53.813]  I mean, they're pulling out the stops right now.
[00:02:55.053 --> 00:03:00.694]  It's a cocktail, a witch's brew, that the neocons believe will steal the election again.
[00:03:00.714 --> 00:03:08.816]  In areas where they don't have control, they plan to use propaganda, intimidation, kicking people off the voter rolls to ensure their victory.
[00:03:09.614 --> 00:03:26.771]  And 35% of the country roughly, and now the numbers look like it may be more, they have their special new CIA controlled machines in place through the big three companies, openly run by former NSA directors and CIA directors, and their own engineers going public admitting it's a huge fraud, but again that's back of the paper.
[00:03:27.908 --> 00:03:32.231]  And so we're going to see what's going to develop, what's going to happen here.
[00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:49.962]  But even if the Democrats sweep the House and gain control of the Senate, or gain control of one of the chambers, upper or lower, it won't really matter because they're going to be rode herd over, cowed, by the mistress to the new world order in Congress, Nancy.
[00:03:50.303 --> 00:03:53.705]  There's not going to be any talk of impeachment, Pelosi.
[00:03:55.535 --> 00:04:00.101]  So, don't think for a minute the Democrats are your saviors, but again, I want to get your take on it.
[00:04:00.121 --> 00:04:00.902]  We'll be taking calls.
[00:04:01.343 --> 00:04:02.905]  Coming up in the next segment, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:02.925 --> 00:04:04.307]  It is eve of Election Day coverage.
[00:04:09.247 --> 00:04:14.070]  We'll have coverage tomorrow into Election Day and then of course post-Election Day.
[00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.492]  We've got Brad Freeman coming on from the Brad Blog in the next few days.
[00:04:17.652 --> 00:04:19.453]  We've got Greg Pallas coming on in the next few days.
[00:04:19.933 --> 00:04:22.314]  BBC, ABC News to report for us.
[00:04:22.354 --> 00:04:30.799]  We've also got Bev Harris who's not doing interviews, she told us, but she'll do one for this broadcast because we've been interviewing her since she first started fighting five years ago.
[00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:33.460]  Her big HBO special was on Friday night.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.481]  I didn't get a chance to see it.
[00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:36.742]  I heard it was pretty powerful, which is encouraging.
[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.302]  Really hard to believe that coming out of HBO, but I guess they're better than some mainstream outlets.
[00:04:43.322 --> 00:04:50.666]  Besides, you can't put perfume on a pig, so why not tell the truth about the fact that we really don't have free elections in many parts of this country.
[00:04:51.226 --> 00:04:57.529]  And then I've got news that's much more important than everything else I've listed, that we'll cover when we get back on the other side of this break.
[00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.910]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.568 --> 00:05:05.009]  It's here!
[00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.978]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:18.012]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.706 --> 00:05:25.749]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:37.473]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, Sikh police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.793 --> 00:05:41.294]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.755 --> 00:05:43.675]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.015 --> 00:05:47.857]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:59.051 --> 00:07:01.373]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:07:01.633 --> 00:07:03.654]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:07:03.814 --> 00:07:10.918]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[00:07:11.119 --> 00:07:19.644]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.

[00:08:00.899 --> 00:08:01.559]  Big Brother.
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.260]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.141]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:05.761 --> 00:08:06.581]  You want answers?
[00:08:07.302 --> 00:08:09.242]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:09.262 --> 00:08:12.824]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:13.064 --> 00:08:17.206]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:23.788 --> 00:08:27.610]  Engaging the New World Order at point-blank range.
[00:08:29.801 --> 00:08:33.103]  Tearing aside their hoaxes, their frauds, their lies.
[00:08:34.344 --> 00:08:37.166]  It is not about left and right, my friends.
[00:08:37.226 --> 00:08:50.074]  It's about exposing the worldwide global crime syndicate that is waging war upon the people using the apparatus of the state, the media, and the private corporations in conjunction.
[00:08:52.336 --> 00:08:59.000]  The enemy is cold-bloodedly dehumanizing, lying, twisting, breaking up our families, poisoning us.
[00:09:01.078 --> 00:09:12.635]  You know what, I was going to play part, because you heard on the national news small clips of what Saddam Hussein was saying and what the judge was saying back to him, if you can call it a judge.
[00:09:13.473 --> 00:09:16.076]  And I'm going to go over the whole trial.
[00:09:16.516 --> 00:09:17.858]  This is completely staged.
[00:09:17.878 --> 00:09:22.723]  The White House admits they're now using it, quote, to push for an election victory.
[00:09:23.183 --> 00:09:35.076]  Meanwhile, Tony Snow says it's preposterous that they have any control over Iraq or that they had the verdict, you know, released and scheduled for less than 48 hours before the election.
[00:09:35.899 --> 00:09:40.201]  We've got the head preacher over the big neocon church here in the U.S.
[00:09:40.541 --> 00:09:45.223]  controlling thousands and thousands of megachurches across the country.
[00:09:45.243 --> 00:09:49.825]  This is the preacher who has a Monday morning prayer meeting every day with George Bush.
[00:09:50.906 --> 00:09:54.668]  You can take one look at the guy and it's all of them.
[00:09:54.708 --> 00:09:57.749]  They're all a bunch of effeminate weirdos.
[00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:03.952]  And of course he's hanging out snorting methamphetamine with male prostitutes.
[00:10:04.873 --> 00:10:06.654]  I'm telling you folks, this is what they do.
[00:10:06.714 --> 00:10:09.055]  If you don't do it, you're not in the club.
[00:10:10.696 --> 00:10:12.056]  This is how they operate.
[00:10:13.577 --> 00:10:15.498]  And so we'll be getting into that.
[00:10:16.358 --> 00:10:18.299]  But again, that story won't get a lot of traction.
[00:10:18.339 --> 00:10:23.201]  It's all going to be the Saddam event over and over again.
[00:10:24.422 --> 00:10:29.064]  But for months I've been meaning to play this song on air because I just love the lyrics.
[00:10:30.228 --> 00:10:33.209]  And I finally sent it up to the network and they've got it.
[00:10:33.429 --> 00:10:36.791]  Before we play Saddam, let's play that Gnarls Barkley crazy song.
[00:10:36.811 --> 00:10:40.572]  I know you've all heard it a million times on the radio, but have you actually gone and read the lyrics to it?
[00:10:41.273 --> 00:10:42.473]  Let's roll this song.
[00:10:42.493 --> 00:10:50.437]  I think it really states very simplistically, very simply and succinctly a lot of my views on the world.
[00:10:50.477 --> 00:10:50.877]  Here it is.
[00:10:54.078 --> 00:10:55.759]  I remember when I lost my mind
[00:10:59.597 --> 00:11:23.546]  There was something so special about that place Even your emotions had an echo in so much space And when you're out there, was out there, yeah I was out of touch But it wasn't because I didn't know enough I just knew too much
[00:11:46.203 --> 00:11:47.683]  We're good to go.
[00:12:13.089 --> 00:12:15.330]  You really think you're in control?
[00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:18.630]  Well, I think you're crazy!
[00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:25.572]  I think you're crazy!
[00:12:26.732 --> 00:12:29.833]  I think you're crazy!
[00:12:31.213 --> 00:12:36.994]  Just like me!
[00:12:37.074 --> 00:12:40.555]  My little red heart pulls the lines out of my neck
[00:12:44.238 --> 00:12:58.862]  And all I remember is thinkin' I wanna be like this Ever since I was little Ever since I was little it looked like fun And there's no coincidence at all And I can die when I'm done
[00:13:48.754 --> 00:14:10.963]  Yeah, that's a powerful song ha ha ha bless your soul you really think you're in control my heroes had the heart To lose their lives out on a limb and all I remember is thinking I want to be like of them Ever since I was little ever since I was little it looked like fun, and it's no coincidence that I've come
[00:14:12.299 --> 00:14:14.080]  And I can die when I'm done.
[00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.502]  I tell you, that's a powerful, powerful song.
[00:14:17.742 --> 00:14:19.262]  You ought to go pull the lyrics up online.
[00:14:20.683 --> 00:14:28.207]  Alright, let me just, I've got to try to encapsulate all this news and information so we have time to cover it all and take your phone calls.
[00:14:28.867 --> 00:14:40.613]  With continuing election coverage here on the GCN Radio Network and a lot of big guests lined up for you to basically chronicle the attempted election fraud and October surprising that is going on.
[00:14:41.329 --> 00:14:41.769]  Right now.
[00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:45.692]  But really, I shouldn't even be talking about the election today.
[00:14:46.692 --> 00:14:51.235]  I should be discussing dehumanization and the worldwide eugenics program.
[00:14:52.676 --> 00:15:02.681]  I saw this little blurb today that says, doctors seek to repeat Hitler eugenics policy by murdering infant newborns born with diabetes in London.
[00:15:04.202 --> 00:15:05.663]  And that was a MySpace posting.
[00:15:05.703 --> 00:15:08.725]  That was the comment made by one of the MySpace posters on my MySpace.
[00:15:09.716 --> 00:15:17.184]  And I thought, well, you know, I've heard about that plan to openly kill small children, to kill adults, to kill newborn babies.
[00:15:17.985 --> 00:15:24.672]  I had known about the big debate raging in England, so when I clicked on This Is London, one of their big papers, the Evening Standard,
[00:15:26.059 --> 00:15:30.300]  I knew that I would be reading an accurate article.
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:36.842]  I unfortunately, you know, already knew about the story and I thought, oh, this just must be some new chapter.
[00:15:36.882 --> 00:15:46.764]  And at that headline, doctors seek to repeat Hitler eugenics policies by murdering infant newborns with disabilities in London.
[00:15:47.824 --> 00:15:50.265]  And then I clicked through and read the actual article.
[00:15:51.645 --> 00:15:54.086]  Poor little picture, this little toddler girl.
[00:15:55.703 --> 00:16:00.187]  Severely disabled Charlotte Wyatt's parents fought to keep her alive.
[00:16:02.429 --> 00:16:10.617]  And even if somebody has no chance of living, you should give them the pain medication they need, you should take care of them.
[00:16:10.977 --> 00:16:16.062]  But see how eugenics, see how quote, right to die, suddenly jump to the state's right to kill you.
[00:16:17.383 --> 00:16:21.467]  The average American doesn't know that the bioethics boards are killing people every day in this country.
[00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:26.352]  I don't know that people who are able to talk and beg for food and water are being murdered.
[00:16:28.433 --> 00:16:45.261]  The media chose to make the case in Florida, Terri Schiavo Schindler, a big issue because it looked like she was a vegetable, she really wasn't, but at least they could have a national debate and it looked more reasonable.
[00:16:46.007 --> 00:16:48.069]  You never see it become a huge news cycle.
[00:16:48.149 --> 00:16:53.953]  Oh, it'll be in a local newspaper that the person begged, please don't kill me, begged for eight days before going into a coma and dying.
[00:16:54.433 --> 00:16:55.995]  I mean, they strap you down, they murder you.
[00:16:56.015 --> 00:16:56.875]  We've listed their names.
[00:16:57.296 --> 00:16:59.337]  The Wall Street Journal has done some reports on it.
[00:17:00.098 --> 00:17:03.200]  We've had some big writers on, researchers on the subject.
[00:17:07.469 --> 00:17:11.971]  But for anybody that thinks the government wouldn't carry out 9-11, well, you know the drill.
[00:17:12.212 --> 00:17:20.796]  Tuskegee experiment, Project Shad, atomic soldiers radiating the children, the biological testing in San Francisco, New York, killing Americans.
[00:17:22.057 --> 00:17:26.779]  There is a upper crust, or upper film of scum.
[00:17:30.061 --> 00:17:33.323]  Cream doesn't rise, scum does, at least to those pinnacles of power.
[00:17:33.663 --> 00:17:37.005]  Cream does rise at certain levels in society, but then the scum eclipses it.
[00:17:39.543 --> 00:17:42.345]  And it's going on right here in the U.S.
[00:17:43.365 --> 00:17:50.590]  But a doctor's group today called for a debate on the mercy killing of disabled babies, because it's going on.
[00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:51.751]  They're killing them now.
[00:17:52.671 --> 00:17:54.212]  They're wanting to have a discussion about it.
[00:17:55.993 --> 00:18:05.959]  The medical profession should examine the active euthanasia of desperately ill newborns of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecology.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.421]  It wants an inquiry into whether the deliberate
[00:18:10.191 --> 00:18:13.373]  Intervention to cause the death of an infant should be legalized.
[00:18:13.773 --> 00:18:14.914]  It already has been.
[00:18:14.934 --> 00:18:16.915]  They're just wanting the final open announcements.
[00:18:17.456 --> 00:18:20.017]  The proposal met with furious response from some quarters.
[00:18:20.558 --> 00:18:32.205]  Last night, Labor Member of Parliament, Jim Dobbin, compared it to the eugenics policies of the Nazis and said, this is the message that only the perfect or acceptable and disabled can be discarded.
[00:18:32.726 --> 00:18:36.208]  They've already started a national DNA database here in the US and England.
[00:18:37.611 --> 00:18:47.498]  34 years ago, simultaneously in New Zealand, Australia, England, the US, and Canada, what I have dubbed the Echelon Countries, because that's the home base of the Echelon System.
[00:18:49.019 --> 00:18:56.664]  I first noticed that all five countries were really having the same laws, under the same names, or similar names, at the exact same time.
[00:18:57.685 --> 00:19:02.648]  Since they coordinate their intelligence apparatus, I dubbed them the Echelon Countries.
[00:19:02.668 --> 00:19:04.049]  I don't even know if that's a good term for them.
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:19.406]  If you were born in a hospital in the last 34 years, please don't email me saying I said 32, that was a few years ago, it's now 34 years.
[00:19:20.427 --> 00:19:25.751]  They take three ampules of blood, one does go to the local health department to test for blood diseases, which they can do at the hospital but don't.
[00:19:26.771 --> 00:19:32.595]  Another goes to a state system, and then another goes to the feds.
[00:19:33.356 --> 00:19:39.160]  But again, they're going to use that for insurance, they're already in England talking about not letting you have babies if you have any genetic problems.
[00:19:40.836 --> 00:19:49.039]  Of course, those genetic problems many times are accompanied by other bizarre genetic traits like increased intelligence or just love.
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.000]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:52.500]  Stay with me.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.521]  We'll get into the election, Saddam, much more.
[00:19:56.215 --> 00:19:57.376]  Ted Anderson from Midas.
[00:19:57.416 --> 00:19:58.216]  Today is November 6, 2006.
[00:19:58.276 --> 00:20:01.198]  Gold opened at $6.26 and one ounce gold coins can be purchased for $6.52.80 and $3.27.42 for half ounce coins.
[00:20:01.238 --> 00:20:01.678]  That's $6.52.80 and $3.27.42.
[00:20:01.798 --> 00:20:09.082]  On June 4, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:28.254]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[00:20:28.714 --> 00:20:32.138]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[00:20:32.218 --> 00:20:35.201]  However, the executive order still stands unrepealed.
[00:20:35.661 --> 00:20:38.444]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[00:20:38.704 --> 00:20:38.985]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:39.005 --> 00:20:40.586]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[00:20:40.626 --> 00:20:40.867]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:47.293 --> 00:20:51.275]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:52.335 --> 00:20:53.835]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:20:53.955 --> 00:20:59.798]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:00.538 --> 00:21:03.199]  Patrick Henry said, give me liberty or give me death.
[00:21:03.919 --> 00:21:14.843]  Did you know that he also forced the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a part of the Constitution of 1787 to guarantee your unalienable or unchangeable rights of freedom of speech?
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:20.061]  Freedom of religion and freedom to own a gun to protect our nation from tyranny.
[00:21:21.021 --> 00:21:26.243]  There is now an assault upon the unalienable, unchangeable rights to deprive you of them.
[00:21:27.063 --> 00:21:34.945]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:22:19.341 --> 00:22:28.688]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:22:28.949 --> 00:22:32.451]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[00:22:59.287 --> 00:23:01.247]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:23:01.748 --> 00:23:04.109]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[00:23:04.941 --> 00:23:13.364]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[00:23:14.324 --> 00:23:19.226]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Incorporated's patented methodology.

[00:23:37.221 --> 00:23:41.704]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:02.748 --> 00:24:05.130]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:09.994]  1-800-25 at 99231.
[00:24:11.756 --> 00:24:22.044]  Later in the broadcast, I'm going to get back into what eugenics is, how it is the religion of the elite, and how they're setting it up upon our planet today.
[00:24:23.445 --> 00:24:27.068]  As Dr. Peter Singer has said, that babies are as worthless as mackerel.
[00:24:27.128 --> 00:24:28.710]  Old people are worthless.
[00:24:29.725 --> 00:24:31.687]  Retarded children or subhuman.
[00:24:32.247 --> 00:24:34.969]  This is the type of garbage that they push.
[00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:38.652]  And believe me, ladies and gentlemen, they're not going to stop there.
[00:24:38.873 --> 00:24:45.918]  Open discussion of the state coming in and killing babies, killing children, killing adults.
[00:24:47.439 --> 00:24:50.462]  This is the crew that's running our society.
[00:24:51.583 --> 00:24:59.089]  Meanwhile, getting back to the election, Saddam Hussein, from the Bush-Hollywood John Wayne set,
[00:25:00.268 --> 00:25:25.294]  Outside Austin, Texas at Crawford, back at the Mafia Ranch, Tony Snow, the government operative, was always a government operative, now just being public about it, said it's ridiculous, it's crazy to say that they have any control over Baghdad, or any control over the court, when it's admitted they control it all, and control the government, and that they didn't have anything to do with the timing of the Saddam death penalty.
[00:25:25.474 --> 00:25:27.615]  Oh, we've gotten the bad man, we're
[00:25:29.238 --> 00:25:30.119]  Gonna kill him!
[00:25:30.179 --> 00:25:36.342]  This shows the war was worth it, and it's all great, and our fearless leader George Bush is wonderful.
[00:25:37.803 --> 00:25:55.653]  The problem is, and I know our listeners are aware of this, but I guess some new listeners aren't, so I'll recap it, is in 1954, they took Saddam Hussein, who was 18 years of age, to Egypt for several years of CIA training and assassination, and espionage, and demolition,
[00:25:57.176 --> 00:26:01.359]  He committed just masses of assassinations.
[00:26:01.399 --> 00:26:03.020]  He was a little James Bond, really.
[00:26:03.041 --> 00:26:04.702]  Well, nothing little about him.
[00:26:05.262 --> 00:26:06.563]  What was he, 6'5", 6'6"?
[00:26:07.124 --> 00:26:10.746]  With a big squad of killers, and they told the Baptists, we'll stop killing you.
[00:26:10.766 --> 00:26:14.129]  Now understand, this is all admitted.
[00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:15.170]  This is mainstream history.
[00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:22.015]  But no one seems to know it, because most Americans don't even know where Baghdad is, or much less Iraq on a map, or what the Tigris-Euphrates is.
[00:26:23.545 --> 00:26:30.607]  And they put Saddam into power as the head of Baathist security and then in 79 he staged a coup becoming the dictator.
[00:26:31.587 --> 00:26:33.688]  Brutal repression then ensued.
[00:26:33.708 --> 00:26:37.029]  He was given over 30 million dollars to launch an attack on Iran.
[00:26:37.149 --> 00:26:38.469]  Over a million Iranians died.
[00:26:38.489 --> 00:26:40.250]  400,000, 300,000 plus Iraqis died in that war.
[00:26:46.685 --> 00:26:49.769]  And then, of course, they told him, go ahead and invade Kuwait.
[00:26:49.789 --> 00:26:51.452]  We don't get involved in inter-Arab affairs.
[00:26:51.852 --> 00:26:52.653]  He rolled in.
[00:26:52.733 --> 00:26:54.676]  They made up stories about babies in incubators.
[00:26:56.037 --> 00:26:58.300]  And now he's been convicted of a 1982 massacre of 170-something people.
[00:27:01.374 --> 00:27:06.615]  Who rose up against him, and that suppression of rebellions was fully supported by U.S.
[00:27:06.655 --> 00:27:07.976]  intelligence, hardware, and money.
[00:27:08.516 --> 00:27:10.676]  He was, of course, given chemical, biological weapons.
[00:27:10.696 --> 00:27:11.717]  He was given nerve gas.
[00:27:12.117 --> 00:27:15.678]  He was given advice, weather reports, satellite intelligence.
[00:27:16.158 --> 00:27:19.999]  During the attacks he launched against the Iranians, those, by the way, were counterattacks.
[00:27:20.059 --> 00:27:21.419]  I'm not defending the use of chemical weapons.
[00:27:21.679 --> 00:27:25.420]  They were using primitive cyanide gas fired from artillery rounds.
[00:27:27.515 --> 00:27:36.184]  So, again, Saddam does deserve to be executed, but not by his bosses, who then set him up, removed him from power.
[00:27:36.224 --> 00:27:46.776]  This is like a mafia don who sends a capo out, a captain out, to order his soldiers, his street thug enforcers, say, in the Bronx, or in Brooklyn, to kill some people,
[00:27:47.396 --> 00:27:57.299]  And then the Mafia Don himself sits as the judge and sentences his capo to be hung by the neck until dead for following his orders.
[00:28:00.419 --> 00:28:01.000]  It's crazy.
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:09.802]  But this is how just hypocritical and ridiculous reality is.
[00:28:11.477 --> 00:28:13.479]  And so Saddam Hussein should not be killed.
[00:28:13.519 --> 00:28:16.281]  And by the way, it probably is Saddam Hussein.
[00:28:16.561 --> 00:28:27.849]  Again, people who say it may be a doppelganger, an actor, there are some facial changes, there are some crooketing of the teeth compared to earlier photos, but teeth do that.
[00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:33.093]  Teeth, you know, as bone and gum disease sets in.
[00:28:33.534 --> 00:28:34.734]  I've looked at his teeth carefully.
[00:28:34.755 --> 00:28:37.156]  A lot of people think that it isn't Saddam.
[00:28:37.376 --> 00:28:40.599]  If it isn't Saddam, it is an incredible actor.
[00:28:42.202 --> 00:28:49.565]  In fact, we just posted a video up on PrisonPlanet.com and JonesReport.com of Saddam.
[00:28:51.126 --> 00:28:56.608]  We're going to play some of the audio, some of the unfiltered audio, because all you heard was a little bit of clips of what he said.
[00:28:56.628 --> 00:29:05.312]  We'll play a little bit more of what he said, what you heard on our news, coming up after this break, and then I promise we will get to your calls.
[00:29:07.069 --> 00:29:16.653]  But while Tony Snow is saying they're not using it politically and it's not a stunt lying, Bush is running around in stump speeches today.
[00:29:16.673 --> 00:29:27.897]  He left the ranch last night and he's saying that this is why they should win the election because they got tough on their business partner, he didn't add that part, Saddam Hussein.
[00:29:29.658 --> 00:29:34.220]  We'll get into more of the election fraud and some of the other October surprises that are being launched.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:38.042]  On the other side of this break, go to your calls.
[00:29:38.962 --> 00:29:40.343]  We do have Steve Watson joining us.
[00:29:40.864 --> 00:29:43.946]  They're talking about releasing more Pentagon footage later this week.
[00:29:46.667 --> 00:29:47.568]  We're on the march.
[00:29:48.068 --> 00:29:49.669]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:53.272]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:58.163 --> 00:30:03.585]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[00:30:04.005 --> 00:30:08.746]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[00:30:09.146 --> 00:30:11.787]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:30:12.267 --> 00:30:15.668]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:30:16.449 --> 00:30:20.770]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:24.391]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:30:24.991 --> 00:30:27.832]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:30.751]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.

[00:30:36.212 --> 00:30:36.873]  Ask for George.

[00:31:45.111 --> 00:31:49.494]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:31:49.534 --> 00:31:52.556]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business
[00:32:08.393 --> 00:32:09.433]  We're good to go.
[00:32:28.882 --> 00:32:29.342]  I think so.
[00:33:12.598 --> 00:33:16.900]  I don't know.
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:33.941]  Welcome back, my friends.
[00:33:34.082 --> 00:33:36.024]  Glad that you were able to join us today.
[00:33:36.204 --> 00:33:38.126]  Mike and Troy and Robert and many others.
[00:33:38.807 --> 00:33:43.011]  Your calls are coming up at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:43.031 --> 00:33:47.115]  At the bottom of the next hour, Steve Watson joins us with important Pentagon information.
[00:33:47.135 --> 00:33:49.558]  They're going to release a new video.
[00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:52.871]  Will Doubletree Hotel video show Pentagon impact?
[00:33:53.291 --> 00:33:57.554]  Conflicting stories make it unclear, yet there are certainly more tapes to come.
[00:33:57.694 --> 00:34:03.637]  Kurt Nimmo wrote another article, I was just referencing Steve's, Pentagon video in the nick of time for midterms.
[00:34:04.097 --> 00:34:07.158]  Scheduled to be released, though, in the next two days.
[00:34:08.399 --> 00:34:09.479]  So that's coming up.
[00:34:11.901 --> 00:34:14.322]  But really, I shouldn't even be talking about the election.
[00:34:14.402 --> 00:34:15.742]  I mean, England and the U.S.
[00:34:15.782 --> 00:34:16.683]  and the Western world
[00:34:17.646 --> 00:34:22.328]  are moving to openly have the state decide when they're going to, quote, kill the disabled.
[00:34:23.348 --> 00:34:28.170]  You see, all the things that the old-timers told us, when the New World Order comes in, they'll get rid of your borders.
[00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:29.991]  And they'll come in with gun control.
[00:34:30.011 --> 00:34:32.372]  They're gonna put tracker chips on all the products.
[00:34:33.072 --> 00:34:35.873]  And when the New World Order comes in, they're gonna kill all the disabled.
[00:34:36.393 --> 00:34:38.914]  When the New World Order comes in, there'll be foreign troops.
[00:34:39.434 --> 00:34:42.035]  When the New World Order comes in, there won't be a Bill of Rights.
[00:34:42.535 --> 00:34:46.657]  When the New World Order comes in, they'll make you take drugs and force vaccines on you.
[00:34:47.688 --> 00:34:49.229]  And who were all these old-timers saying?
[00:34:49.309 --> 00:34:53.791]  They were all former military colonels, generals, people who worked in the State Department.
[00:34:54.871 --> 00:34:55.992]  That's why they knew.
[00:34:56.012 --> 00:34:57.293]  They were there.
[00:34:57.853 --> 00:35:01.935]  This has been planned for a long, long time.
[00:35:01.955 --> 00:35:07.077]  I remember interviewing, what was that doctor's name?
[00:35:07.097 --> 00:35:07.938]  He was an engineer.
[00:35:07.958 --> 00:35:08.878]  He also had a doctorate.
[00:35:08.918 --> 00:35:11.960]  He worked at the Pentagon back in the 60s and 70s.
[00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:14.601]  And he said, there's going to be tracker chips in all the products.
[00:35:15.561 --> 00:35:21.805]  And I remember text Mars in 95 off of that research from the 70s with the book Project Lucid.
[00:35:21.825 --> 00:35:23.886]  You read that book, everything he wrote about is now happening.
[00:35:23.906 --> 00:35:27.989]  Of course, he was an Air Force officer and also a professor of space and aeronautics.
[00:35:28.869 --> 00:35:30.930]  But it's all happening.
[00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:31.691]  It's all unfolding.
[00:35:31.731 --> 00:35:34.052]  Okay, before I get into the Saddam news, I'm going to take your calls.
[00:35:35.773 --> 00:35:37.254]  And then get back into the election news.
[00:35:38.335 --> 00:35:39.215]  Very exciting.
[00:35:39.255 --> 00:35:41.677]  I want to thank you, the listeners, for what you did last week.
[00:35:43.232 --> 00:35:46.234]  I was pleasantly surprised before I went out of town on Friday.
[00:35:46.274 --> 00:35:47.515]  I took off Friday.
[00:35:47.775 --> 00:35:48.135]  I did it.
[00:35:48.355 --> 00:35:51.877]  We had a lot of great interviews and we re-aired the Gore Vidal and the C.I.E.
[00:35:51.957 --> 00:35:56.860]  Steele interview and the Joseph Stiklitz interview, the Nobel Prize winner, former Chief Economist, World Bank.
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:02.564]  We interviewed those Friday, very important interviews, people that had requests and who hadn't had a chance to hear them or hear them in their entirety.
[00:36:04.044 --> 00:36:07.086]  But I took off so I didn't have time to really thank you on air because I wasn't here.
[00:36:07.106 --> 00:36:09.067]  I didn't have an opportunity.
[00:36:09.628 --> 00:36:11.729]  Thank you because you pushed
[00:36:12.805 --> 00:36:23.089]  Terror Storm to number nine on the Amazon charts to number one in the documentary section, but to number nine on the total Amazon video charts.
[00:36:24.169 --> 00:36:29.751]  And the screenshots my office got were it at 17, but it did hit nine.
[00:36:29.831 --> 00:36:34.153]  I did see it at nine and at 12 when I was out at the farm.
[00:36:34.173 --> 00:36:36.753]  We even had internet connection out in the country.
[00:36:37.654 --> 00:36:40.855]  I did go look at it for a few minutes, but I was really spending time with the family.
[00:36:42.014 --> 00:36:44.957]  And, uh, that is very exciting.
[00:36:44.997 --> 00:36:49.242]  It's now since sunk back to 50-something this morning, uh, when I checked.
[00:36:49.762 --> 00:36:54.687]  Let's send it to number 1, and then after it goes to number 1, I want to just say it was at number 1 at least once.
[00:36:55.988 --> 00:36:58.111]  Let's send it to number 1, not number 9.
[00:36:58.371 --> 00:37:02.175]  And I polled it went to 8, but I didn't see that with my own eyes.
[00:37:04.145 --> 00:37:05.645]  I'd have been here Friday and hyped it.
[00:37:05.685 --> 00:37:07.806]  We would have sent it to number one.
[00:37:07.846 --> 00:37:12.047]  That's important to be able to say it was number one on Amazon.com.
[00:37:12.827 --> 00:37:27.311]  I want to be able to say that, not because I care about being number one, but because it's effective and it will create a major buzz and Amazon.com is what video store purchasers and bookstores around the country use as one of their number one indicators.
[00:37:29.291 --> 00:37:32.852]  So I want to be able to say it went to number one on the key chart
[00:37:34.122 --> 00:37:34.542]  All right.
[00:37:35.523 --> 00:37:37.284]  And it did sell out of Barnes and Nobles.
[00:37:37.364 --> 00:37:40.946]  It did sell out of Borders, but that's not a very big feat.
[00:37:41.406 --> 00:37:43.647]  Most of those stores just had a few copies.
[00:37:43.667 --> 00:37:45.849]  I think the average was three copies per store.
[00:37:46.849 --> 00:37:49.691]  They had 120 copies here in Austin and Waterloo.
[00:37:49.711 --> 00:37:50.711]  That did sell out that night.
[00:37:50.731 --> 00:37:52.673]  I want to thank those that dropped by.
[00:37:52.693 --> 00:37:55.954]  Some of my personal friends, I heard, after I'd left, dropped by.
[00:37:55.974 --> 00:38:01.317]  I want to thank Jimmy, who I heard dropped by and was listening and bought some copies.
[00:38:01.357 --> 00:38:02.198]  I know he already had some.
[00:38:02.939 --> 00:38:06.964]  Again, the film is $11.19 on Amazon.
[00:38:07.325 --> 00:38:21.103]  You're not going to find that price, well, that wouldn't be true if I sold it anywhere else, because if you get America Freedom to Fascism from us, then with it you can get Terrorist Form for $9.95, but you're not going to find it by itself that low anywhere.
[00:38:22.658 --> 00:38:25.719]  And so, even if you've already bought a copy, please go buy another.
[00:38:25.779 --> 00:38:26.620]  Give it as a gift.
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:29.541]  Give it as a birthday present, a Christmas present, an early gift.
[00:38:29.861 --> 00:38:31.582]  Get it, make copies of it, whatever.
[00:38:31.982 --> 00:38:34.243]  Please go to Amazon.com.
[00:38:34.563 --> 00:38:38.565]  And if you don't want to have to find it on Amazon.com, go to InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:38:38.945 --> 00:38:43.087]  We have links directly to the sub-page where you can buy it.
[00:38:43.147 --> 00:38:46.008]  So you don't have to search around on Amazon.com.
[00:38:46.308 --> 00:38:47.509]  And buy four or five copies.
[00:38:47.529 --> 00:38:48.089]  You can afford it.
[00:38:48.149 --> 00:38:48.449]  Buy 20 copies.
[00:38:48.469 --> 00:38:48.909]  Buy 10 copies.
[00:38:52.205 --> 00:38:55.486]  I mean, at $11.00, $11.19, you cannot beat that price.
[00:38:56.486 --> 00:38:58.506]  Again, we need to go to number one.
[00:38:58.546 --> 00:39:03.127]  Let's push it to number one, and then I won't harp on it anymore.
[00:39:03.147 --> 00:39:09.108]  In fact, Friday I was tempted to not leave and to get on air and really push for people to switch to number one.
[00:39:09.488 --> 00:39:10.649]  It would have gone to number one.
[00:39:10.689 --> 00:39:14.489]  I'm kind of kicking myself, but I rarely take off, and again, I wanted to.
[00:39:15.789 --> 00:39:18.250]  It's been years since I've gone deer hunting with family.
[00:39:21.161 --> 00:39:25.143]  I wanted to go spend some time and sit around the campfire.
[00:39:25.163 --> 00:39:26.403]  I saw a ton of deer.
[00:39:26.443 --> 00:39:27.103]  I didn't shoot them.
[00:39:27.303 --> 00:39:32.486]  I mean, I guess go process it and turn it into venison and eat it.
[00:39:32.866 --> 00:39:34.927]  But I was trying to hunt varmints.
[00:39:35.847 --> 00:39:38.908]  The wild Russian boars and then there's wild hogs.
[00:39:38.928 --> 00:39:40.129]  There's two different varieties.
[00:39:40.149 --> 00:39:42.029]  They're eating the baby deer.
[00:39:42.169 --> 00:39:43.970]  They're attacking people's dogs.
[00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:46.891]  Did you know wild boars are meaner than wolves?
[00:39:49.486 --> 00:39:53.948]  I did see one hog running along a fence line on the other side of the property.
[00:39:53.988 --> 00:39:54.708]  I couldn't shoot it.
[00:39:56.569 --> 00:40:00.110]  I did take a couple of pathetic shots at coyotes.
[00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:01.650]  I had never missed hunting.
[00:40:03.071 --> 00:40:04.231]  I had never missed.
[00:40:07.453 --> 00:40:08.573]  And I missed twice.
[00:40:09.793 --> 00:40:10.474]  You get rusty.
[00:40:11.134 --> 00:40:12.794]  Also, I was shooting on the fly.
[00:40:13.415 --> 00:40:15.595]  You walk out in the field and there's a coyote running along.
[00:40:17.665 --> 00:40:26.008]  Tree line in tall grass and people say, how dare you kill a coyote or try to kill a coyote?
[00:40:27.049 --> 00:40:29.850]  Well, they're overpopulated.
[00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:31.690]  As many coyotes as I saw, I saw two of them.
[00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:34.792]  That's quite a bit in broad daylight just running around.
[00:40:35.632 --> 00:40:39.013]  The pigs and the coyotes are really hurting the deer population.
[00:40:41.914 --> 00:40:44.036]  If you don't know what's going on in many parts of the country, you're not aware of it.
[00:40:44.476 --> 00:40:48.499]  The pigs are just breeding and breeding and breeding and breeding and breeding.
[00:40:48.519 --> 00:40:50.320]  Alright, this is not a show about hunting.
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.281]  I'm going to shut up right there.
[00:40:51.301 --> 00:40:52.162]  I'm going to stop right there.
[00:40:52.542 --> 00:40:53.803]  You do not tune in to hear about this.
[00:40:53.823 --> 00:40:59.347]  If you go up to PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com, you can read this article.
[00:40:59.547 --> 00:41:02.489]  Bush trumpets Iraq verdict to rally support.
[00:41:02.529 --> 00:41:03.570]  It's out of the New York Times.
[00:41:04.911 --> 00:41:11.396]  President Bush on Sunday seized on the conviction of Saddam Hussein as a milestone in Iraq, seeking to rally Republican voters
[00:41:12.219 --> 00:41:19.826]  With an issue of national security, as some polls suggested that his party might be making gains in the final hours of the campaign.
[00:41:19.846 --> 00:41:24.070]  Yeah, Republicans paid for polls, so when they steal the election it won't look too obvious.
[00:41:24.831 --> 00:41:34.120]  They always do this, right beforehand, saying, well, hundreds of other polls show we're going to lose by 10 points, but not here, it's neck and neck, we're gaining ground.
[00:41:35.655 --> 00:41:44.539]  The White House said the timing of the announcement two days before Election Day had nothing to do with American politics and had been directed by the Iraq court.
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:49.722]  The Amnesty International and many others have looked at how the court was operated.
[00:41:50.502 --> 00:41:52.103]  Three of Saddam's lawyers were killed.
[00:41:52.163 --> 00:41:53.704]  Another one of the assistants was killed.
[00:41:54.244 --> 00:41:55.705]  He was given two different judges.
[00:41:56.265 --> 00:41:57.826]  He wasn't allowed to bring in real evidence.
[00:41:58.246 --> 00:42:03.369]  He was drugged from the courtroom every time he tried to testify or talk about how he was under CIA control.
[00:42:06.773 --> 00:42:19.798]  So for Bush and Tony Snow and others to say that it's crazy, quote, that they're doing this for political gain less than 48 hours before the election starts, election day tomorrow, it's a fraud.
[00:42:21.059 --> 00:42:23.880]  Today we witnessed a landmark event in the history of Iraq.
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:35.685]  Saddam Hussein was convicted and sentenced to death by the Iraq High Tribunal, Mr. Bush said, to roars of approval in a hockey auditorium packed with supporters in Grand Island, Nebraska.
[00:42:36.391 --> 00:42:43.714]  Saddam Hussein's trial is a milestone in the Iraqi people's effort to replace the rule of a tyrant with the rule of law.
[00:42:45.475 --> 00:42:49.476]  That tyrant was put into power by our criminal government.
[00:42:51.697 --> 00:43:03.282]  Back in 54, when they hired him and trained him for a few years, the criminal national security apparatchik had just been in power since 47, hadn't yet killed the president in 63, hadn't yet taken full control.
[00:43:04.187 --> 00:43:14.377]  But the very same people that put him into power as the head of Baath Security in 1969, the head of the Iraqi government in a coup in 1979, the whole thing, told him, go ahead and go into Kuwait.
[00:43:14.417 --> 00:43:15.298]  That's admitted!
[00:43:16.239 --> 00:43:20.824]  And so, wouldn't it disgust you to see a Mafia don, sitting as the judge,
[00:43:23.152 --> 00:43:45.530]  Or a Mafia Don giving a press conference, talking about his capo that followed orders and committed murders, talking about how it's a great day that that capo is going to be killed, but meanwhile, Bush directly worked for the president, for the system, his father was the president, and Bush did work in the White House, by the way.
[00:43:46.751 --> 00:43:47.772]  It's just sick!
[00:43:49.193 --> 00:43:51.435]  It's totally sick!
[00:43:52.352 --> 00:43:59.281]  To see this, to see this happening, and here are some of the mainstream news articles we link to from over the past few years.
[00:43:59.842 --> 00:43:59.962]  U.S.
[00:44:00.002 --> 00:44:03.066]  helped as Saddam plotted chemical attacks, report says, London Guardian.
[00:44:04.408 --> 00:44:06.411]  Rumsfeld offered to help Saddam.
[00:44:06.631 --> 00:44:09.435]  Flashback, Saddam could call CIA in his defense.
[00:44:11.676 --> 00:44:12.657]  But he wasn't allowed to.
[00:44:13.097 --> 00:44:15.058]  Saddam's silence from fingering U.S.
[00:44:15.098 --> 00:44:15.999]  and Iraq bombings.
[00:44:16.379 --> 00:44:19.421]  Flashback, how the CIA found and groomed Saddam.
[00:44:19.882 --> 00:44:23.224]  Flashback, April Gillespie's mission to allow Saddam to invade Kuwait.
[00:44:24.145 --> 00:44:26.086]  You know, this is the stuff that's admitted!
[00:44:27.687 --> 00:44:30.269]  This is a shame!
[00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:34.011]  Saddam's conviction is our conviction!
[00:44:35.032 --> 00:44:36.473]  Because Saddam was our boy!
[00:44:38.141 --> 00:44:44.785]  Well, and like even neocon followers will say, well that's true Alex, I've been in debates with them on the radio, with different talk show hosts.
[00:44:45.145 --> 00:44:50.569]  Well it is true he was ours, but you know, that's how things work, and that's just how you do it.
[00:44:50.989 --> 00:44:57.573]  Well, Bin Laden was our man, but you know, he turned against us and that's just what happens sometimes.
[00:45:03.141 --> 00:45:05.903]  You think your government won't enslave you if they can get away with it?
[00:45:05.943 --> 00:45:08.064]  If they'd fund somebody like Saddam to do that?
[00:45:08.844 --> 00:45:12.546]  Or if they'd fund somebody like the Shah to do things like Saddam did, but even at a greater level?
[00:45:14.667 --> 00:45:17.189]  Let's play this little clip of Saddam, then I promise we'll go to your calls.
[00:45:17.309 --> 00:45:21.091]  I said I'd go to them early, but there's a lot of news, and we'll have open phones throughout the broadcast.
[00:45:23.272 --> 00:45:24.533]  Here is Saddam Hussein.
[00:45:24.553 --> 00:45:27.955]  This is a little more of the audio that you didn't hear on our national news.
[00:45:27.995 --> 00:45:30.716]  Our national news, and on television, you just played little clips of it.
[00:45:30.996 --> 00:45:31.857]  Here's a little bit more.
[00:45:31.917 --> 00:45:32.217]  Here it is.
[00:45:32.845 --> 00:45:34.666]  Can you remain standing please?
[00:45:35.266 --> 00:45:37.567]  We would like to read out the verdict.
[00:45:38.527 --> 00:45:40.388]  I am listening to you.
[00:45:40.608 --> 00:45:42.149]  Now, I'm sitting down.
[00:45:42.509 --> 00:45:43.209]  I'm not standing.
[00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:46.310]  I would like to remain seated.
[00:45:46.330 --> 00:45:48.831]  Do not touch me.
[00:46:04.576 --> 00:46:07.380]  I'll have a word with you.
[00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:13.549]  The court has decided to sentence defendant Saddam Hussein Al-Majid
[00:46:15.178 --> 00:46:18.059]  To be executed with hanging.
[00:46:18.139 --> 00:46:19.779]  Long live the people!
[00:46:19.799 --> 00:46:22.920]  Long live the nation!
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:26.841]  Down with the traitors!
[00:46:26.881 --> 00:46:28.181]  Down with the invaders!
[00:46:28.461 --> 00:46:29.342]  God is great!
[00:46:29.402 --> 00:46:30.402]  God is great!
[00:46:30.422 --> 00:46:31.162]  God is great!
[00:46:31.422 --> 00:46:32.422]  Article number 10 of 2005.
[00:46:32.462 --> 00:46:36.183]  This decision and verdict has been in accordance with 244.
[00:46:44.986 --> 00:46:47.227]  Long live the nation!
[00:46:47.708 --> 00:46:48.949]  Down with the agents!
[00:46:49.889 --> 00:46:53.332]  Down with the invaders!
[00:46:53.352 --> 00:47:00.196]  In accordance with article 24, go to hell with your law and your articles and clauses!
[00:47:04.065 --> 00:47:04.425]  Number two.
[00:47:04.446 --> 00:47:07.089]  Your Honor, there is a person here who's laughing and smirking.
[00:47:07.209 --> 00:47:08.190]  Why is he laughing?
[00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:09.271]  He's provoking the lawyers.
[00:47:25.374 --> 00:47:27.536]  We are the people of this land.
[00:47:27.676 --> 00:47:29.198]  We are the people of this land.
[00:47:30.619 --> 00:47:32.181]  We are the people of this land.
[00:47:32.281 --> 00:47:42.071]  You are also sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for torturing people and for crimes against humanity in accordance with Article 24 and Article 15.
[00:47:44.333 --> 00:47:45.474]  I curse the Asians.
[00:47:45.554 --> 00:47:46.355]  I curse you.
[00:47:46.395 --> 00:47:46.915]  God is great.
[00:47:46.955 --> 00:47:47.736]  God is great.
[00:47:47.836 --> 00:47:48.697]  And God is great.
[00:47:48.737 --> 00:47:48.937]  May...
[00:48:05.871 --> 00:48:11.601]  In accordance with article 24 of the law of the Iraqi, the criminal law of 2005, and this agreement has been taken unanimously.
[00:48:16.709 --> 00:48:20.932]  Those who have strayed will be punished and will be penalized.
[00:48:21.133 --> 00:48:25.796]  And the Iraqi people should have it in their hearts to forgive those who have strayed.
[00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:47.293]  So there's a little bit longer clip of what was going on.
[00:48:49.154 --> 00:48:53.557]  You know, let me just briefly break down one more little facet of this.
[00:48:54.478 --> 00:48:59.121]  You see, the global program that has been declassified both in England, the U.S.
[00:48:59.161 --> 00:49:03.585]  and Israel, and it's the same stratagem that all three governments concocted.
[00:49:04.705 --> 00:49:09.029]  It's really the old British strategy that goes back to, you know, 1918 to the 1920s.
[00:49:11.946 --> 00:49:14.249]  When they always wanted to carve Iraq up in three parts.
[00:49:14.769 --> 00:49:18.413]  But Iran was the bigger threat so they put their own agent into Iraq.
[00:49:18.854 --> 00:49:20.636]  But then he industrialized the country.
[00:49:20.716 --> 00:49:21.697]  Jews lived in peace.
[00:49:21.737 --> 00:49:23.739]  Christians lived in peace.
[00:49:24.861 --> 00:49:27.804]  Saddam's government had Christians and Jews in it.
[00:49:29.123 --> 00:49:31.005]  The Playboy was sold on the shelves.
[00:49:31.065 --> 00:49:35.728]  I'm not saying that's an indicator of a free society, but they had rock and roll stations, classical stations.
[00:49:36.368 --> 00:49:40.171]  Sixty percent, that's the number of their college graduates, were women.
[00:49:40.211 --> 00:49:41.972]  Most of their new doctors were women.
[00:49:42.672 --> 00:49:45.134]  The women nowhere in the country wore the hoods.
[00:49:46.255 --> 00:49:48.076]  And they didn't like it.
[00:49:48.136 --> 00:49:49.717]  It was becoming a first world country.
[00:49:50.457 --> 00:49:51.438]  And so they set him up.
[00:49:52.526 --> 00:49:54.268]  He was over-producing in 2000.
[00:49:54.308 --> 00:49:58.513]  I remember in the news at the time, they were saying, Saddam, you're over-pumping, you're driving down gas prices.
[00:49:58.553 --> 00:50:01.236]  He said, look, I've got big debts, I'm paying you back!
[00:50:02.057 --> 00:50:09.425]  The globalists, whether it's Serbia, and again they use Muslims there to attack, or whether it's Iraq, and they'll use Kurds, they'll use Shia,
[00:50:10.126 --> 00:50:17.408]  It doesn't matter, anyone who's sovereign, anyone who wants to build their country up, and I'm not saying he was an angel, he was U.S.
[00:50:17.428 --> 00:50:24.270]  trained, he then tried to do what Mohamed Mozadek did, who was again Man of the Year in 1953 in Iran, pro-American, anti-communist.
[00:50:24.851 --> 00:50:25.791]  They overthrow them.
[00:50:25.851 --> 00:50:29.512]  They don't want strong leaders walking around in suits and ties.
[00:50:30.392 --> 00:50:30.812]  Okay?
[00:50:31.413 --> 00:50:36.074]  They don't want, you know, McDonald's and Best Buy.
[00:50:36.773 --> 00:50:42.560]  Okay, they want dirt and camels running around and people starving to death with fighter bombers flying over bombing.
[00:50:43.301 --> 00:50:44.242]  And that's what you've got now.
[00:50:44.562 --> 00:50:45.844]  Millions of Iraqis are dead.
[00:50:46.344 --> 00:50:48.287]  Six hundred plus thousand in the last three and a half years.
[00:50:48.807 --> 00:50:50.089]  And it's going to continue forever.
[00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:51.290]  It's genocide.
[00:50:51.971 --> 00:50:52.572]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:59.762 --> 00:51:05.186]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:05.587 --> 00:51:13.233]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:13.913 --> 00:51:20.979]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:21.379 --> 00:51:28.265]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:32.762]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:33.102 --> 00:51:36.623]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:37.063 --> 00:51:38.964]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:39.324 --> 00:51:43.246]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:54:21.609 --> 00:54:34.634]  Welcome back!
[00:54:34.854 --> 00:54:42.917]  Glad you were able to join us.
[00:54:43.914 --> 00:54:50.077]  Let's go ahead and go to your calls, and now I will rocket through calls, and I'll start going through other October surprises that are going on right now.
[00:54:50.757 --> 00:54:53.958]  Mike in Brooklyn, thanks for holding her on the air worldwide, sir.
[00:54:53.978 --> 00:54:55.259]  All righty, Alex.
[00:54:55.719 --> 00:55:00.961]  First off, I'd like to say I, myself, and many other people appreciate what you do for us every day.
[00:55:02.281 --> 00:55:06.503]  Well, I'm just trying to protect my country in which my family lives, and I'm trying to stand up against tyranny.
[00:55:06.543 --> 00:55:09.064]  To me, it's an instinctive thing to do, but thank you.
[00:55:09.524 --> 00:55:10.425]  And we're behind you.
[00:55:11.125 --> 00:55:13.466]  First thing, I don't really have any questions.
[00:55:14.122 --> 00:55:29.245]  I heard you talking on yesterday's broadcast about how you enjoy hunting and I know you know that you're not the most favorite person on their list and I was just talking to my brother last night and we were saying that's something you got to watch out for.
[00:55:29.935 --> 00:55:32.496]  You know, hunting possible accidents, if you know what I mean?
[00:55:32.636 --> 00:55:41.139]  No, I hear you, but people always bring up my imminent death, and I hope to be like Mark Twain and say, rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated.
[00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:42.820]  I'm very careful with guns.
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:44.521]  I was brought up with good hunting safety.
[00:55:44.601 --> 00:55:45.461]  I rarely go hunting.
[00:55:45.521 --> 00:55:47.462]  It's mainly a family event.
[00:55:47.982 --> 00:55:49.463]  You know, it's just a pastime.
[00:55:49.483 --> 00:55:52.424]  But yeah, my wife was even saying that.
[00:55:52.464 --> 00:55:52.944]  You know what?
[00:55:53.424 --> 00:55:54.865]  If they want to kill me, they can.
[00:55:55.165 --> 00:55:57.306]  It's in God's hands, and I'm not going to worry about it.
[00:55:57.751 --> 00:55:58.751]  Yeah, that's true.
[00:55:59.151 --> 00:56:04.153]  Actually, one question is... Hell, I slept out in the field by myself in a tent!
[00:56:04.933 --> 00:56:06.334]  Which is, if they want to kill me, they can.
[00:56:06.354 --> 00:56:08.355]  I mean, I don't want to die, but I'm just not going to worry about it.
[00:56:08.515 --> 00:56:09.615]  Yeah, you've got to be free.
[00:56:10.735 --> 00:56:17.518]  One thing I was thinking about, the ironic thing is, when it comes to Saddam, he's going to be punished by death, right?
[00:56:17.578 --> 00:56:20.378]  Now, what about all government, you know, for 9-11?
[00:56:20.759 --> 00:56:21.839]  Innocent people that they killed.
[00:56:22.378 --> 00:56:36.344]  There's no debating that going back to the Eisenhower administration, that right through Republican, Democrat, it didn't matter, everything you saw in Iraq was engineered by our government.
[00:56:36.464 --> 00:56:37.204]  No debating it.
[00:56:37.484 --> 00:56:39.005]  The historians are unanimous.
[00:56:39.505 --> 00:56:43.747]  So how do you kill a CIA officer, Saddam Hussein?
[00:56:44.707 --> 00:56:45.187]  Exactly.
[00:56:46.168 --> 00:56:47.588]  I mean, the guy was following orders.
[00:56:47.628 --> 00:56:48.429]  I think he's horrible.
[00:56:48.809 --> 00:56:51.310]  I think the program was horrible, but it's a fraud.
[00:56:52.438 --> 00:56:53.199]  True, true.
[00:56:54.159 --> 00:57:02.745]  And just to let you know, I've been picking up your DVDs and also Aaron Russo's Freedom to Fascism and I've been pumping them out to everybody I know.
[00:57:04.346 --> 00:57:09.029]  Well that's good, we've got a shipment of those coming in today, Freedom to Fascism.
[00:57:09.069 --> 00:57:14.653]  They have been really going quick and I'm glad that people are getting them at InfoWars.com.
[00:57:14.733 --> 00:57:15.833]  God bless you, thanks for the call.
[00:57:16.214 --> 00:57:18.255]  Troy in West Virginia, you're on the air, welcome.
[00:57:22.645 --> 00:57:27.067]  With the elections tomorrow, I was wondering if you still think that the United States of America is going to attack itself?
[00:57:28.368 --> 00:57:35.511]  Well, I have been on record saying that I believe that by late October into early November there would be a terror attack, if...
[00:57:36.238 --> 00:57:41.539]  We didn't get the word out, and that's my prediction, and Fox News covered my prediction.
[00:57:41.679 --> 00:57:45.500]  It was the 9-11 truth, when absolutely ape, talking about false flag.
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:46.460]  I wasn't the only one.
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:55.701]  And I think that with 84% in a major poll not believing the official 9-11 story, that we may have backed them off for this period of time in staging an attack.
[00:57:58.222 --> 00:57:58.502]  Okay.
[00:58:00.342 --> 00:58:04.103]  I don't necessarily agree with that, but... You think they may still launch an attack?
[00:58:04.683 --> 00:58:05.403]  No, no, I don't...
[00:58:05.981 --> 00:58:07.622]  9-11 wasn't an inside job.
[00:58:08.402 --> 00:58:11.103]  Oh, you're the fella that called, uh... Yeah.
[00:58:11.143 --> 00:58:11.763]  Well, stay there.
[00:58:11.883 --> 00:58:15.584]  You're the guy that called about a week ago when I had Aaron Russo on.
[00:58:16.885 --> 00:58:17.105]  Right?
[00:58:17.145 --> 00:58:17.965]  That was you, right?
[00:58:18.345 --> 00:58:18.565]  Yeah.
[00:58:19.246 --> 00:58:21.627]  Well, if you disagree with me, sir, you would have been first in the line.
[00:58:21.647 --> 00:58:23.407]  You've got to learn to tell us you disagree.
[00:58:24.548 --> 00:58:26.788]  Don't you know you get privileged treatment here?
[00:58:27.569 --> 00:58:28.529]  Please, stay with us.
[00:58:28.589 --> 00:58:29.529]  Red carpet for you.
[00:58:30.370 --> 00:58:31.110]  I get what you're saying.
[00:58:31.130 --> 00:58:32.610]  You're saying my prediction didn't come true.
[00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:34.191]  My prediction did come true.
[00:58:36.607 --> 00:58:41.712]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:52.845 --> 00:58:53.486]  Big Brother.
[00:58:54.146 --> 00:58:55.207]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:55.927 --> 00:58:57.088]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:57.689 --> 00:58:59.150]  You want answers?
[00:58:59.250 --> 00:59:00.131]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:00.151 --> 00:59:04.574]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:04.994 --> 00:59:09.117]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:11.599 --> 00:59:13.561]  Alright, continuing election coverage.
[00:59:13.581 --> 00:59:15.102]  We've got the October surprise.
[00:59:15.122 --> 00:59:20.786]  The Bush administration springing a Saddam verdict, which was scheduled weeks ago for less than 48 hours out.
[00:59:22.225 --> 00:59:28.890]  They're now announcing they may release video, another video, showing a plane hitting the Pentagon as we predicted they would do.
[00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:32.853]  Steve Watson joining us from London with his great analysis in 30 minutes.
[00:59:32.873 --> 00:59:38.578]  There's another great story along similar lines by Kurt Nemo we have up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:59:39.338 --> 00:59:51.768]  I want to get into a evening standard story out of the UK where they're going to start euthanizing the infirm, the ill,
[00:59:52.854 --> 00:59:54.115]  Very scary report.
[00:59:54.616 --> 00:59:56.697]  So two hours left, wide open phones.
[00:59:57.078 --> 00:59:58.879]  If you disagree, you go to the head of the line.
[00:59:58.979 --> 01:00:00.360]  And we don't screen your calls.
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.302]  We just ask your name and where you're calling from.
[01:00:02.942 --> 01:00:05.865]  But I do ask you if you disagree to tell us so we can put you at the head of the line.
[01:00:06.425 --> 01:00:09.348]  Troy, you've called a couple times disagreeing, called last week.
[01:00:10.008 --> 01:00:12.350]  Why don't you tell us you disagree when you call in?
[01:00:12.370 --> 01:00:14.652]  Do you think we're lying and that we wouldn't have you on?
[01:00:15.365 --> 01:00:16.806]  They don't ask me if I agree or disagree.
[01:00:16.826 --> 01:00:18.106]  I've heard Jack Blood say it.
[01:00:18.126 --> 01:00:19.927]  I don't think I've heard you say it.
[01:00:19.947 --> 01:00:21.008]  Maybe I have.
[01:00:21.068 --> 01:00:21.988]  I don't remember.
[01:00:22.008 --> 01:00:24.350]  I might listen for the first hour or two, three times a week.
[01:00:37.316 --> 01:00:38.157]  Wow, okay.
[01:00:38.957 --> 01:00:40.178]  Let me just ask you a question.
[01:00:41.159 --> 01:00:47.883]  You called in and you said, for stations that just joined us, you said, do you believe the government's still going to attack itself?
[01:00:49.123 --> 01:00:58.966]  And you said, with your prediction, and my prediction clearly was, if we didn't get the word out about government-sponsored terror, that it was going to happen.
[01:00:59.006 --> 01:01:06.908]  I saw all the same indicators I witnessed on the lead-up before 9-11, which I did predict would happen, saying the towers would be hit, saying Bin Laden would take the blame.
[01:01:07.549 --> 01:01:08.409]  I did do that.
[01:01:09.309 --> 01:01:10.629]  Are you denying that I did that?
[01:01:11.010 --> 01:01:15.251]  And are you saying that my prediction was we would be attacked without the proviso
[01:01:15.971 --> 01:01:17.512]  I mean, you say you listened, did you not?
[01:01:17.552 --> 01:01:24.515]  Well, yeah, I heard you say that, but it sounds like you're saying that you and others of your ilkage just prevented another terror attack.
[01:01:24.555 --> 01:01:25.435]  Is that what you believe?
[01:01:26.015 --> 01:01:26.356]  Yes.
[01:01:26.736 --> 01:01:27.136]  Okay.
[01:01:27.656 --> 01:01:31.798]  Well, no, because there's already some people saying, Alex Jones predicted an attack and it didn't happen.
[01:01:32.278 --> 01:01:43.523]  I said if we didn't get the word out, just like I said back in 2001 on July 25th, when I said if we don't get the word out and call the White House and tell them don't blow up the World Trade Center, it's going to happen.
[01:01:44.409 --> 01:01:53.876]  So I said again, I saw all the stars aligning, as they say, for there to be another event leading up to the election.
[01:01:54.196 --> 01:01:59.020]  Well you've been predicting this for five years since the one from 9-11.
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:03.884]  That's right, and I did say there'd probably be attacks in Europe, and there were in Madrid, and there were in London.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:06.701]  Because they wanted to get Europe behind what was happening.
[01:02:06.721 --> 01:02:07.342]  It didn't work.
[01:02:08.002 --> 01:02:11.144]  And I did predict there would be a biological attack on the day of 9-11.
[01:02:11.825 --> 01:02:13.786]  And three weeks later, the anthrax got announced.
[01:02:13.866 --> 01:02:14.547]  So yeah, you're right.
[01:02:14.587 --> 01:02:15.207]  I did predict that.
[01:02:15.687 --> 01:02:16.088]  All right.
[01:02:16.868 --> 01:02:18.329]  Are you saying that's not true either?
[01:02:18.709 --> 01:02:19.530]  I mean, what are you saying?
[01:02:19.610 --> 01:02:21.091]  I mean, what do you disagree with?
[01:02:22.112 --> 01:02:29.937]  Well, I disagree with the fact that you think that you and others of your ilkage prevented another terror attack.
[01:02:30.475 --> 01:02:31.196]  By getting the message out?
[01:02:31.216 --> 01:02:31.396]  Okay.
[01:02:45.450 --> 01:02:50.831]  Before November elapsed, in mid-November, I said, it looks like we're backing him off.
[01:02:51.351 --> 01:02:52.891]  Fox News covered my prediction.
[01:02:53.372 --> 01:02:55.432]  A lot of other publications covered my prediction.
[01:02:56.092 --> 01:02:57.732]  I wasn't the only one seeing this.
[01:02:57.872 --> 01:03:04.354]  All the other 9-11 truth leaders said, Webster Tarpley, Jim Fetzer, they said they saw it in the tea leaves.
[01:03:04.994 --> 01:03:06.914]  And I mean that figuratively, folks.
[01:03:07.574 --> 01:03:09.435]  And I'm talking about some gypsy wagon here.
[01:03:09.455 --> 01:03:10.755]  This is just political analysis.
[01:03:12.543 --> 01:03:19.109]  Well, I just think you kind of left yourself a little scapegoat there, just because if it happened... Well, it wouldn't be a scapegoat, it would be an escape hatch.
[01:03:19.549 --> 01:03:20.310]  Escape hatch, okay.
[01:03:20.851 --> 01:03:21.911]  Hey, do you want to stay there?
[01:03:22.252 --> 01:03:23.513]  Well, I can if you want me to.
[01:03:23.653 --> 01:03:27.456]  Sure, please, because I've got a few questions for you as someone who disagrees.
[01:03:27.476 --> 01:03:29.058]  I want to understand your mind.
[01:03:29.678 --> 01:03:31.880]  I want to be enlightened by you.
[01:03:32.361 --> 01:03:33.122]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:33.222 --> 01:03:35.143]  JonesReport.com is the website.
[01:03:35.864 --> 01:03:37.846]  Masses of news and information straight ahead.
[01:03:51.650 --> 01:03:57.111]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:03:57.471 --> 01:04:05.133]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:05.813 --> 01:04:12.854]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:13.255 --> 01:04:20.176]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spies,
[01:04:20.635 --> 01:04:24.677]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:24.997 --> 01:04:28.498]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:28.958 --> 01:04:30.899]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:31.219 --> 01:04:35.140]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:48.228 --> 01:04:53.310]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:04:53.370 --> 01:05:00.672]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:05:00.832 --> 01:05:11.435]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:05:11.656 --> 01:05:16.197]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:05:16.497 --> 01:05:21.482]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[01:05:21.702 --> 01:05:24.624]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:24.864 --> 01:05:34.593]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than 2 cents per gallon.
[01:05:34.613 --> 01:05:35.674]  Get a 2-pack for only $99 or a 4-pack for only $188.

[01:05:50.123 --> 01:05:54.245]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:05:54.465 --> 01:05:56.226]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:05:56.486 --> 01:06:02.768]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:06:03.069 --> 01:06:09.191]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:06:09.431 --> 01:06:15.474]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[01:06:15.754 --> 01:06:22.160]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[01:06:22.321 --> 01:06:25.864]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[01:06:26.164 --> 01:06:29.868]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[01:06:30.048 --> 01:06:32.591]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:06:32.731 --> 01:06:33.712]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:06:33.712 --> 01:06:37.293]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:06:37.313 --> 01:06:39.174]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:00.302 --> 01:07:07.007]  That's right, in occupied North America, under North American Union control, under NORTHCOM command.
[01:07:07.027 --> 01:07:16.594]  The military has openly announced they are in operational control of the Lower 48 and its possessions, as well as Hawaii and Alaska.
[01:07:17.035 --> 01:07:25.161]  They have announced that foreign troops will be used in disasters or to quell terrorist or insurrection, rebellion or conspiracy.
[01:07:26.511 --> 01:07:31.595]  We are coming to you from deep behind enemy lines in occupied United States.
[01:07:32.515 --> 01:07:50.408]  For all listeners north, south, east and west, worldwide, all ships at sea, this is the voice of the free United States in resistance against the New World Order occupation forces who are staging terror attacks and an ongoing program to scare the population into serving their One World Government Empire plans.
[01:07:51.294 --> 01:07:54.777]  All right, let's go back to Troy in West Virginia who called last week.
[01:07:54.817 --> 01:07:55.578]  He's called again.
[01:07:56.018 --> 01:07:57.179]  He disagrees with me.
[01:07:57.759 --> 01:08:04.145]  Specifically, sir, I mean, you don't believe that 9-11 had any government involvement whatsoever?
[01:08:04.165 --> 01:08:06.187]  No.
[01:08:08.228 --> 01:08:12.172]  Do you think that I'm lying when I talk about the Gulf of Tonkin being a staged event in 64?
[01:08:12.292 --> 01:08:16.315]  I honestly have no idea.
[01:08:16.335 --> 01:08:18.217]  I don't even know what the Gulf of Tonkin is.
[01:08:20.268 --> 01:08:20.969]  Is this a joke?
[01:08:21.089 --> 01:08:22.691]  I mean, you sound serious.
[01:08:22.711 --> 01:08:23.732]  Are you joking?
[01:08:25.213 --> 01:08:26.374]  I work with 60 people.
[01:08:26.434 --> 01:08:27.856]  I can ask them what the Gulf of Pompkin is.
[01:08:27.876 --> 01:08:29.798]  They ain't gonna know what I'm talking about.
[01:08:29.818 --> 01:08:31.579]  I mean, I'm not a historian.
[01:08:31.599 --> 01:08:36.544]  But you're talking about something 40 years ago anyways.
[01:08:36.685 --> 01:08:42.050]  I don't... I think when you called last week, you brought up the USS Liberty.
[01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:43.011]  Yeah, because I went ahead and...
[01:08:44.041 --> 01:08:46.063]  I would like to do some research on the internet on that.
[01:08:46.343 --> 01:08:46.924]  Oh, you did?
[01:08:47.204 --> 01:08:47.504]  Yeah.
[01:08:47.684 --> 01:08:50.907]  What, did you go to the Knesset to get your research?
[01:08:52.388 --> 01:08:52.669]  No.
[01:08:53.369 --> 01:08:54.430]  You know what the Knesset is?
[01:08:54.830 --> 01:08:54.990]  No.
[01:08:56.332 --> 01:08:57.452]  That's the Israeli government.
[01:08:57.473 --> 01:08:59.154]  It's their parliament.
[01:09:01.055 --> 01:09:04.678]  I mean, so what are you saying I'm lying about with the U.S.S.
[01:09:04.718 --> 01:09:05.019]  Liberty?
[01:09:11.224 --> 01:09:12.405]  That America wanted
[01:09:13.277 --> 01:09:14.017]  The USS Liberty?
[01:09:15.378 --> 01:09:16.578]  Oh crap, I can't remember.
[01:09:16.938 --> 01:09:20.700]  Well, America didn't do anything.
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:24.721]  It was LBJ in operational control of the ship.
[01:09:24.761 --> 01:09:26.562]  And people ask, well, how do you know that?
[01:09:26.902 --> 01:09:29.283]  I've interviewed the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[01:09:29.583 --> 01:09:31.783]  I've interviewed the admirals that talk to LBJ.
[01:09:31.823 --> 01:09:33.304]  I've interviewed the people involved.
[01:09:33.664 --> 01:09:38.826]  That ship was involved in surveillance under the Security Council's control.
[01:09:39.847 --> 01:09:46.840]  And for that mission, the White House, under McNamara, Defense Secretary, was in direct control of the mission of that ship.
[01:09:47.601 --> 01:09:48.844]  It was outside of the Navy.
[01:09:49.717 --> 01:10:12.260]  And as many black-op or secret programs are, Delta Forces, the Navy SEALs are routinely, these are called Presidential Missions, and they were there gaining intelligence during the Six-Day War, and the Israeli aircraft came in and they strafed and bombed the ship, torpedo boats attacked and strafed the ship, and this went on for more than two and a half
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:15.441]  hours and they radioed the aircraft carriers for help.
[01:10:15.842 --> 01:10:20.684]  Jets were launched and LBJ ordered them to turn back and said he wanted the ship to go to the bottom.
[01:10:20.724 --> 01:10:23.765]  Now the admirals are the ones that said that here on the air.
[01:10:23.805 --> 01:10:24.986]  That's my source.
[01:10:25.046 --> 01:10:26.927]  The admirals who listened to LBJ.
[01:10:27.287 --> 01:10:35.471]  They're in the command crow's nest there in the conning tower of the flagship of the fleet, the aircraft carrier.
[01:10:36.271 --> 01:10:43.176]  And we know that that is indeed what happened, and that they wanted to then try to sink the ship and blame it on Egypt.
[01:10:43.296 --> 01:10:46.058]  Most ships would sink, but everyone stayed at their quarters.
[01:10:46.098 --> 01:10:47.679]  They did disaster drills every week.
[01:10:47.959 --> 01:10:49.220]  They locked down the bulkheads.
[01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:52.442]  Men literally were burned to death, went into fires.
[01:10:52.502 --> 01:10:55.704]  That was back when men were men, cars were cars, and women were women.
[01:10:56.004 --> 01:10:58.986]  They went in there and closed those bulkheads so it didn't sink.
[01:10:59.806 --> 01:11:02.027]  I think you report certain things that you want to hear.
[01:11:28.964 --> 01:11:30.304]  You don't listen to the other side?
[01:11:31.065 --> 01:11:32.106]  The other side, sir.
[01:11:32.266 --> 01:11:47.055]  I have interviewed, it's got to be five admirals, then the former head JAG officer, Captain Ward Boston, and then became Admiral Boston, who was mid-level then in the JAG, and he was ordered to falsify the report.
[01:11:47.115 --> 01:11:48.997]  He has testified to that in sworn statement.
[01:11:51.438 --> 01:11:53.440]  You think Admiral Boston's lying?
[01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:55.261]  He's still alive.
[01:11:55.301 --> 01:11:56.001]  We could get him on.
[01:11:56.361 --> 01:11:57.042]  The others have died.
[01:11:58.281 --> 01:11:59.302]  I can't debate you on it.
[01:12:00.663 --> 01:12:00.803]  Yep.
[01:12:00.863 --> 01:12:01.563]  I don't know why they would.
[01:12:25.509 --> 01:12:26.569]  You just think I'm lying?
[01:12:26.609 --> 01:12:28.150]  You think the admirals didn't really say this?
[01:12:32.190 --> 01:12:33.150]  I don't know.
[01:12:33.751 --> 01:12:40.912]  You know, in the film, in Terror Storm, I show screenshots of their sworn testimony to Congress, sworn testimony to the Naval Board.
[01:12:40.952 --> 01:12:43.252]  You can go, you know, just type in the headline on those.
[01:12:43.272 --> 01:12:45.673]  You can pull those actual sworn testimonies up.
[01:12:47.613 --> 01:12:48.653]  Well, maybe I'll do that again.
[01:12:49.494 --> 01:12:50.934]  And maybe you should type in
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:59.164]  Gulf of Tonkin staged, or Gulf of Tonkin documents declassified, and maybe you can read the actual documents and then you won't think I'm lying?
[01:13:03.587 --> 01:13:06.708]  Well, either it was or it wasn't, and I still don't think it was.
[01:13:07.789 --> 01:13:09.770]  So you're just going to operate on faith, you see?
[01:13:10.190 --> 01:13:11.491]  Faith is something you believe.
[01:13:11.551 --> 01:13:12.752]  I'm operating on facts.
[01:13:14.092 --> 01:13:16.033]  So you just said yes, you're going to operate on faith.
[01:13:17.887 --> 01:13:24.553]  If I was an expert on it, I could probably have a very good debate with you from the other... But you're admitting you don't know, but then you're just saying you don't believe it.
[01:13:24.833 --> 01:13:25.374]  Right.
[01:13:25.734 --> 01:13:30.178]  You know, like you're saying you don't believe in the Loch Ness Monster.
[01:13:30.198 --> 01:13:34.302]  Well, there's evidence that you'd be right about that, but there's not evidence that you're right about this.
[01:13:34.642 --> 01:13:36.904]  You are saying you do believe in the Loch Ness Monster.
[01:13:37.124 --> 01:13:38.105]  You're going on faith.
[01:13:38.245 --> 01:13:39.166]  I'm giving you evidence.
[01:13:43.294 --> 01:13:44.396]  Well, I can't argue with you.
[01:13:53.934 --> 01:14:00.398]  You're having trouble believing there are evil people out there, and that's why naive folks all the time get scammed and get hoodwinked and get killed.
[01:14:00.438 --> 01:14:04.201]  I do believe there's evil people, but not as evil as you make them out to be.
[01:14:04.381 --> 01:14:05.582]  Okay, let me ask you a question.
[01:14:05.622 --> 01:14:12.466]  Do you believe that I'm lying that our government paid $3 billion to have Israel, and again, Israel's just as big a culprit.
[01:14:12.486 --> 01:14:15.348]  The point is, our government paid to have Israel irradiate 110,000 of their own children.
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:20.941]  Sounds illogical, but I don't know.
[01:14:21.341 --> 01:14:26.202]  Okay, do you think I was lying when I read the London Evening Standard that they're going to start killing people with disabilities?
[01:14:26.222 --> 01:14:27.942]  The government, out in the open, killing them?
[01:14:29.203 --> 01:14:30.343]  It just seems illogical.
[01:14:30.783 --> 01:14:33.764]  Okay, do you know about black men and the Tuskegee Experiment?
[01:14:34.504 --> 01:14:34.764]  No.
[01:14:35.724 --> 01:14:42.046]  So you don't know that they gave thousands and thousands of black men syphilis and then let them spread it and die of it over 45 years?
[01:14:42.146 --> 01:14:44.266]  I mean, I imagine the stuff could happen in
[01:14:48.451 --> 01:14:51.092]  50 years ago, yeah, but not today.
[01:14:51.152 --> 01:14:55.573]  Sir, would you agree we were more moral in many respects 50 years ago than we are now?
[01:14:57.533 --> 01:15:01.114]  Were we more moral in most areas 50 years ago?
[01:15:02.534 --> 01:15:03.394]  I guess you're probably right.
[01:15:04.054 --> 01:15:11.116]  Okay, then how could they knowingly tell black men at quote free government clinics, I'm going to give you a vaccination, and they really gave them syphilis?
[01:15:12.836 --> 01:15:14.376]  And then watch them die of it and spread it?
[01:15:15.937 --> 01:15:16.677]  I can't answer that.
[01:15:17.444 --> 01:15:18.765]  Do you know what syphilis does to you?
[01:15:20.366 --> 01:15:20.566]  No.
[01:15:20.746 --> 01:15:24.228]  They're basically microscopic worms that eat your liver and brain and your organs.
[01:15:26.309 --> 01:15:27.170]  Does that sound friendly?
[01:15:27.190 --> 01:15:28.871]  Of course not.
[01:15:29.531 --> 01:15:32.493]  But do you think I'm making up Tuskegee?
[01:15:33.853 --> 01:15:34.854]  Tuskegee, Alabama.
[01:15:37.505 --> 01:15:37.706]  No.
[01:15:38.006 --> 01:15:48.856]  The Houston Chronicle reported they're testing biologicals and chemical weapon derivatives at the federal facility, the state facility, there in Huntsville, Texas.
[01:15:49.837 --> 01:15:50.197]  Right now.
[01:15:51.298 --> 01:15:53.501]  See, you hear that stuff and you take it as fact all the time.
[01:15:53.561 --> 01:15:54.642]  No, no, it's admitted, sir.
[01:15:58.385 --> 01:16:01.288]  Somebody else might say, no, it's not true, but you won't hear that side.
[01:16:02.466 --> 01:16:02.866]  I don't know.
[01:16:03.007 --> 01:16:03.687]  No, no, no, no.
[01:16:03.727 --> 01:16:04.728]  Sir, this is admitted.
[01:16:05.288 --> 01:16:05.649]  Okay.
[01:16:05.769 --> 01:16:07.510]  Did you ever hear about the Atomic Soldiers?
[01:16:09.952 --> 01:16:11.853]  I don't do what you do for a living, no.
[01:16:13.735 --> 01:16:15.896]  You know, are you playing a joke on me?
[01:16:15.916 --> 01:16:17.958]  Do you really believe this stuff and you're just acting stupid?
[01:16:18.198 --> 01:16:18.498]  No.
[01:16:21.241 --> 01:16:26.825]  You're talking about Atomic Soldiers, aren't you?
[01:16:27.065 --> 01:16:29.147]  What percent of the population knows what that is?
[01:16:31.912 --> 01:16:39.276]  So, because Galileo knew the world was round and 98% didn't, did that make Galileo a kook?
[01:16:41.257 --> 01:16:41.497]  No.
[01:16:43.358 --> 01:16:44.618]  Look, open source.
[01:16:45.479 --> 01:16:58.745]  The elite openly say, sir, they plan to build a worldwide police state, and they plan through forced vaccinations to give you debilitating diseases and chemical injections to kill you.
[01:16:59.325 --> 01:17:00.346]  I bet you don't believe that.
[01:17:02.185 --> 01:17:03.206]  I find it hard to believe.
[01:17:03.686 --> 01:17:04.667]  I do too, my friend.
[01:17:05.027 --> 01:17:07.509]  That's why me and my wife had trouble going to sleep last night.
[01:17:10.651 --> 01:17:12.213]  Maybe you focus on the negative too much.
[01:17:14.174 --> 01:17:15.235]  Well, there's a lot of negative.
[01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:19.202]  Are we ever going to fix the negative if we don't clean it up?
[01:17:19.482 --> 01:17:29.411]  I mean, that's like if you left a dog in your house and it tore up the couch and, you know, urinated everywhere and pooped all over the floor and then you just walked in and told your wife, hey, let's not clean this up.
[01:17:29.451 --> 01:17:39.560]  Let's ignore that he tore up the couch and he went to the bathroom and he chewed holes in the walls because, number one, we're idiots and left the dog in here over the weekend.
[01:17:40.081 --> 01:17:42.223]  Let's just ignore it and let's just walk around in it.
[01:17:43.382 --> 01:17:48.123]  Would that be negative of you, or let's use a more real world example.
[01:17:48.543 --> 01:18:04.968]  Let's say a possum climbs down your air conditioning vent, this happened to my parents, and rots inside of it, and they had to go in and have people come in and cut out the air conditioning, you know, central heating and cooling to get the rotten possum out.
[01:18:06.013 --> 01:18:13.038]  Or should you just smell it and just the stench pumping through your system and just ignore it and say, I'm not going to be negative and say there's a dead possum.
[01:18:13.278 --> 01:18:15.539]  I'm going to sit here and smell it and ignore it.
[01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:18.041]  No, I'd do something about it.
[01:18:19.281 --> 01:18:20.442]  Well, that's what we're doing, sir.
[01:18:20.462 --> 01:18:25.866]  And we happen to know that there's a big fat dead possum in the central heating and cooling system.
[01:18:25.906 --> 01:18:26.526]  And it stinks.
[01:18:27.427 --> 01:18:28.227]  And it's foul.
[01:18:28.968 --> 01:18:30.469]  And we're not going to sit here and deny it.
[01:18:30.969 --> 01:18:32.690]  Now, I smelled it when it started stinking.
[01:18:33.343 --> 01:18:40.066]  Now the thing is bloated and got maggots all over it, and would gag a maggot, and you're still saying you can't smell it.
[01:18:41.587 --> 01:18:41.787]  Okay?
[01:18:41.807 --> 01:18:43.548]  Hey, I appreciate your call.
[01:18:43.568 --> 01:18:45.489]  I'm gonna get into the election and take more calls when we get back.
[01:18:54.413 --> 01:18:56.514]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[01:18:56.994 --> 01:18:57.675]  One and the same.
[01:18:58.415 --> 01:18:59.756]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%,
[01:19:02.771 --> 01:19:08.252]  In a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:19:08.652 --> 01:19:11.793]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:19:12.053 --> 01:19:13.874]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:19:13.934 --> 01:19:16.974]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:19:18.855 --> 01:19:19.735]  Here is reality.
[01:19:20.095 --> 01:19:23.676]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:19:24.156 --> 01:19:27.817]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:19:28.397 --> 01:19:31.218]  Gold, in the same time frame, increased 35% in value.
[01:19:32.583 --> 01:19:36.288]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.
[01:19:36.648 --> 01:19:38.130]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:38.170 --> 01:19:38.410]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:49.630 --> 01:19:52.172]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:19:52.772 --> 01:19:58.115]  Did you know that the United Nations has never settled disputes, but always makes them worse?
[01:19:58.695 --> 01:20:02.657]  Our own ambassador to the United Nations in 1982 admitted such.
[01:20:03.257 --> 01:20:11.602]  Did you know that the United Nations ignores communist atrocities, but always targets non-communist nations and their leaders for overthrow?
[01:20:12.663 --> 01:20:23.111]  We would like to help you understand why these things are happening and how they fulfill Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to News Watch Magazine.

[01:20:48.777 --> 01:20:51.798]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:20:52.119 --> 01:20:57.041]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:20:57.301 --> 01:21:01.643]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:21:01.943 --> 01:21:10.847]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.

[01:21:14.969 --> 01:21:19.998]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:21:20.299 --> 01:21:27.050]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:21:27.531 --> 01:21:28.072]  What about you?
[01:21:28.806 --> 01:21:34.168]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:21:48.504 --> 01:21:53.286]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[01:21:53.506 --> 01:21:57.487]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[01:21:57.747 --> 01:22:04.049]  As you may have heard by now, Ken's Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.

[01:22:51.079 --> 01:22:55.722]  Let's go right back to calls.
[01:22:55.902 --> 01:22:57.944]  Robert in Canada.
[01:22:57.984 --> 01:22:58.384]  Welcome.
[01:22:59.585 --> 01:23:00.285]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:23:00.486 --> 01:23:00.866]  Good sir.
[01:23:01.606 --> 01:23:04.929]  I'd like to thank you all for all your hard work and really appreciate it.
[01:23:05.618 --> 01:23:09.619]  I purchased Terror Storm this morning, as well as Aaron Russo's Freedom of Fascism.
[01:23:09.639 --> 01:23:10.579]  Thank you!
[01:23:10.919 --> 01:23:13.880]  I'd like to ask all Canadian listeners to also purchase it.
[01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:16.500]  Whatever affects you guys, affects us up here as well.
[01:23:17.581 --> 01:23:19.161]  I just have one question, Alex.
[01:23:19.901 --> 01:23:24.162]  Canada has lost 43 soldiers in Afghanistan out of 2,000 soldiers.
[01:23:24.182 --> 01:23:24.982]  That's about 50 to 1.
[01:23:25.122 --> 01:23:28.823]  It's about the same per capita as what the Americans have lost in Iraq.
[01:23:29.563 --> 01:23:33.184]  I'd just like to know what you think is the real reason for the war in Afghanistan.
[01:23:34.255 --> 01:23:41.139]  Well, it's a huge drug war, and the only killing that's going on is rival gangs that are growing their own poppies.
[01:23:41.199 --> 01:23:42.979]  And meanwhile, the British and Canadian and U.S.
[01:23:42.999 --> 01:23:45.741]  troops openly guard the poppy fields.
[01:23:46.181 --> 01:23:50.083]  They also grow marijuana over there, and it's just a huge drug operation for the CIA.
[01:23:50.463 --> 01:23:56.486]  They're also controlling the region to put in the different pipelines for Unicole and others, Unical and others.
[01:23:56.506 --> 01:23:57.847]  I was wondering about the pipelines.
[01:23:58.396 --> 01:24:00.878]  I'd also like to, if I could, just plug my website.
[01:24:01.278 --> 01:24:03.080]  I have it hosted on your guys' servers.
[01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:03.780]  Oh, great!
[01:24:04.341 --> 01:24:09.665]  Speak911TruthToPower.com Speak911TruthToPower.com Yes, sir.
[01:24:10.525 --> 01:24:11.826]  Fantastic, good to hear from you.
[01:24:12.287 --> 01:24:13.968]  Let's talk to Roy in Maryland.
[01:24:14.008 --> 01:24:14.748]  Roy, welcome.
[01:24:16.230 --> 01:24:16.890]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:24:17.190 --> 01:24:18.992]  I called her a couple of times ago.
[01:24:19.112 --> 01:24:22.394]  We might be in ilk, but he's almond hotep, king of denial.
[01:24:22.995 --> 01:24:27.198]  Hey, I was thinking about the Saddam Hussein verdict.
[01:24:27.819 --> 01:24:32.703]  And I was looking at the timing of this thing and they're saying, you know, maybe in a couple months they're actually going to pull it off.
[01:24:33.344 --> 01:24:40.410]  I wonder if the New World Order has set him up as a modern day Haman and they'll hang him on Purim, just like the story of Ruth in the Bible.
[01:24:42.492 --> 01:24:43.413]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:24:43.453 --> 01:24:44.274]  They might do that.
[01:24:44.534 --> 01:24:46.096]  They love to reenact things.
[01:24:46.156 --> 01:24:46.416]  Listen.
[01:24:47.711 --> 01:24:50.735]  Again, I'm against killing Saddam because he was a U.S.
[01:24:50.775 --> 01:24:57.503]  government agent, and everything he did was under the orders or acquiescence and support of the criminals that run this country.
[01:24:57.543 --> 01:25:00.447]  So killing him is a fraud, if it's even Saddam.
[01:25:00.467 --> 01:25:02.510]  I mean, they admit the Kurds had whoever that is.
[01:25:03.010 --> 01:25:03.971]  Yeah, we certainly are.
[01:25:03.991 --> 01:25:05.451]  Just like Carrie's comment the other day.
[01:25:05.491 --> 01:25:06.852]  That was pretty much
[01:25:25.672 --> 01:25:31.019]  Might have helped any of the military personnel when they go to vote, maybe threw them on the other side.
[01:25:31.219 --> 01:25:31.800]  Exactly!
[01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:42.614]  Look, it's Bush's cousin, his skull and bones mate, who took a dive in 2004, pulling the exact same move at the exact right, all of this is part of a
[01:25:43.468 --> 01:25:48.990]  A whole group of October surprises happening, and they admit that they control the Iraqi government.
[01:25:49.010 --> 01:25:50.430]  They admit they control that court.
[01:25:50.751 --> 01:25:53.551]  Of course they timed it for less than 48 hours.
[01:25:53.591 --> 01:25:55.852]  What, 36 hours before the start of election day.
[01:25:56.192 --> 01:25:57.333]  This is all staged.
[01:25:57.793 --> 01:26:05.495]  Well, these so-called Islamic fascists that they talk about, I mean, you're really going to have worse problems.
[01:26:05.636 --> 01:26:07.196]  I mean, they're not stupid.
[01:26:07.216 --> 01:26:09.797]  They know what the Jewish holiday of Purim is.
[01:26:10.342 --> 01:26:14.245]  They know what that is, and if they do that, that's just going to further inflame the Arab world.
[01:26:14.845 --> 01:26:19.909]  And, you know, it's almost like, can you even blame them for being that inflamed?
[01:26:20.710 --> 01:26:28.796]  Well, there are real Muslim fighters, terrorists, insurgents, mujahideen, whatever people call them, you know, different perspectives.
[01:26:30.037 --> 01:26:34.661]  But most of the big attacks, in fact, all the big attacks were orchestrated, and there's others that are provocateured.
[01:26:35.001 --> 01:26:38.904]  Then there's real resistance going on that's dubbed terrorism.
[01:26:40.048 --> 01:26:51.956]  But radical Islamic Jihadism was funded and shepherded and tootled under the tutelage of the neocon system that's now in full power.
[01:26:52.416 --> 01:26:58.079]  And P2OG, the Pentagon Plan, states they're going to go over there and kill innocent people to elicit a response.
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:02.122]  Well, it's like that last caller we were talking about.
[01:27:02.142 --> 01:27:08.586]  It's like, I can't believe someone with his head so far in the ground can actually use that much fluoride toothpaste.
[01:27:10.419 --> 01:27:12.239]  Yeah, and I think that caller's serious.
[01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:14.440]  I mean, he's for real.
[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:20.221]  He's, I mean, you start thinking it's a joke, but I don't know about this, I don't know about that, I just don't believe you.
[01:27:20.702 --> 01:27:21.642]  But you know, I run into that.
[01:27:21.682 --> 01:27:29.744]  People who disagree with us, that 16% that'll buy anything in this country, I just feel sorry for them.
[01:27:30.644 --> 01:27:38.526]  Well, you know, it's, you know, people are waking up, but you also know, it's like, you look around, it's like, these people don't have a clue.
[01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:41.141]  I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[01:27:41.802 --> 01:27:43.223]  We're going to continue with open phones.
[01:27:43.243 --> 01:27:47.306]  We've got an hour and a half left in this transmission against Terry today.
[01:27:47.347 --> 01:27:48.708]  It is November 6, 2006.
[01:27:49.749 --> 01:27:56.174]  And Steve Watson is coming up in the next segment for just a quick report.
[01:27:57.423 --> 01:28:00.185]  You wrote a great article for Infowars.net over the weekend.
[01:28:00.225 --> 01:28:01.626]  It's a top story there right now.
[01:28:02.086 --> 01:28:05.789]  Will Double 3 hotel video show Pentagon impact?
[01:28:06.169 --> 01:28:10.132]  Conflicting stories make it unclear, yet there are certainly more tapes to come.
[01:28:11.433 --> 01:28:14.315]  I'll tell you why this is such an important story when we get back.
[01:28:15.175 --> 01:28:17.717]  Remember a few months ago when they released the last Foggy video?
[01:28:18.778 --> 01:28:19.778]  I said there's going to be more?
[01:28:19.818 --> 01:28:20.599]  Well, there's going to be more.
[01:28:21.588 --> 01:28:24.309]  We'll break this down on the other side.
[01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:28.952]  Infowars.net, JonesReport.com, Infowars.com are the websites.
[01:28:38.617 --> 01:28:41.618]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:42.539 --> 01:28:45.220]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:49.767 --> 01:28:53.814]  Hey, want to know a natural healing treatment that's been around for thousands of years?

[01:29:13.676 --> 01:29:17.519]  Bath salts release toxins as they soften and rehydrate the skin.
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:21.723]  Pretty salt lamps to ionize the air and reduce EMF radiation.

[01:29:50.778 --> 01:29:51.319]  Wow!
[01:29:51.479 --> 01:29:56.764]  The weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation!
[01:29:57.064 --> 01:29:57.664]  Yeah.
[01:29:58.045 --> 01:29:59.466]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[01:29:59.826 --> 01:30:03.229]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel berkey system.
[01:30:03.690 --> 01:30:05.191]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[01:30:05.631 --> 01:30:07.353]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[01:30:07.733 --> 01:30:09.515]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[01:30:09.715 --> 01:30:10.556]  Honey, cheer up!
[01:30:10.956 --> 01:30:13.218]  I brought our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[01:30:13.499 --> 01:30:13.799]  What?

[01:30:25.009 --> 01:30:29.854]  You know, this is a terrific cabin, and wow, have you noticed the beautiful weather?
[01:30:30.174 --> 01:30:31.356]  Don't ruin your vacation.
[01:30:31.456 --> 01:30:33.259]  Get a Travel Berkey today for only $209.
[01:30:33.299 --> 01:30:34.020]  Or get a Sport Berkey for only $39.
[01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:34.340]  Call 888-803-4438.
[01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:34.540]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:35.562]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:30:35.662 --> 01:30:36.944]  Travel Berkey not available in Iowa.
[01:30:49.082 --> 01:30:51.484]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:30:52.004 --> 01:30:55.307]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[01:30:55.687 --> 01:30:58.629]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[01:30:58.910 --> 01:31:05.295]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[01:31:05.355 --> 01:31:09.778]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[01:31:09.998 --> 01:31:14.360]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[01:31:14.521 --> 01:31:17.122]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[01:31:17.162 --> 01:31:19.923]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[01:31:20.384 --> 01:31:22.925]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[01:31:22.965 --> 01:31:27.227]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[01:31:27.267 --> 01:31:28.108]  Treasury bonds.
[01:31:28.388 --> 01:31:33.031]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[01:31:33.191 --> 01:31:34.832]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:31:34.852 --> 01:31:36.433]  That's 1-888-8XANADU or 1-888-XANADU and ask for George.
[01:31:54.695 --> 01:31:57.661]  George, Lloyd, Dale, many others, your calls are coming up.
[01:31:57.701 --> 01:32:01.008]  Wide open phones on this election eve transmission.
[01:32:01.429 --> 01:32:02.512]  Toll free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[01:32:05.413 --> 01:32:09.116]  In the next hour, I will run through a big stack of news I haven't even gotten to yet.
[01:32:09.696 --> 01:32:18.743]  All over the country, the thumb scanners are going in to get the school lunches, but unlike the past, parents have now learned that this is a police state and what it's all about, and they're resisting.
[01:32:19.023 --> 01:32:25.667]  We'll talk about how that ties into the drills, unannounced, putting guns in children's heads, terrorizing them under federal grants.
[01:32:26.628 --> 01:32:33.193]  I haven't even gotten into a lot of the other little election year scams that are being run right now.
[01:32:34.364 --> 01:32:41.107]  Little October, what you could call November surprises that are taking place as we speak.
[01:32:41.127 --> 01:32:52.291]  We're about to go to Steve Watson for the balance of this hour, and we'll go right back to your calls, Steve, concerning new video to be released, supposedly of the Pentagon getting hit and what that really means.
[01:32:54.973 --> 01:33:03.156]  But let me just briefly besiege thee to go to InfoWars.com if you're online and to get America Freedom to Fascism
[01:33:03.928 --> 01:33:04.609]  We're good to go.
[01:33:20.567 --> 01:33:30.311]  Or you can get America Freedom From Fascism by itself at Infowars.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 888-253-3139 or you can simply write to me I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100 Austin Texas 78704
[01:33:49.685 --> 01:34:01.696]  And I would also encourage you to go to InfoWars.com and to notice that TerrorStorm on the Amazon charts
[01:34:04.281 --> 01:34:05.702]  Went up to number 9.
[01:34:05.762 --> 01:34:06.663]  I was told it went to number 8.
[01:34:06.863 --> 01:34:08.204]  We didn't get a screenshot of that.
[01:34:08.604 --> 01:34:11.126]  It went up to number 9 Friday afternoon.
[01:34:11.586 --> 01:34:13.768]  It has since dropped back to a 50 and 60s.
[01:34:13.888 --> 01:34:15.609]  We're moving back and forth in that area.
[01:34:16.290 --> 01:34:17.290]  I want to get a number 1.
[01:34:17.651 --> 01:34:19.492]  I want to be able to say this was number 1.
[01:34:20.373 --> 01:34:32.121]  So many people buy stuff just because it's number 1 and we want to use every angle we can to get this information exposing the history of government sponsored terror into everyone's hands now.
[01:34:33.974 --> 01:34:36.156]  And if I would have been here Friday, I took off Friday.
[01:34:36.176 --> 01:34:38.138]  I snuck off and went deer hunting with family.
[01:34:39.018 --> 01:34:44.383]  I could have driven it and pushed it all the way up to number one when we hit number nine, but I wasn't here.
[01:34:44.863 --> 01:34:46.905]  So please, go get another copy.
[01:34:46.965 --> 01:34:50.087]  It's only $11.19 at Amazon.com.
[01:34:50.528 --> 01:34:51.769]  Buy four or five copies.
[01:34:51.869 --> 01:34:52.970]  If you can afford it, buy a hundred.
[01:34:53.070 --> 01:34:55.071]  Give them to everybody you know.
[01:34:55.091 --> 01:34:56.833]  Buy one copy, make copies, whatever.
[01:34:57.293 --> 01:34:59.475]  I want to drive it to number one because that gauges
[01:35:00.314 --> 01:35:02.498]  Uh, so many places with so many people.
[01:35:03.199 --> 01:35:07.667]  Uh, so many video outlets, bookstores, record stores, music stores, video stores.
[01:35:08.402 --> 01:35:16.206]  That Amazon chart is the most looked at, and already because it went into the top 20 and in the top 10, has already caused a huge interest.
[01:35:16.226 --> 01:35:18.668]  So please, let's drive it to number one.
[01:35:19.248 --> 01:35:21.589]  This is so important in the fight against the New World Order.
[01:35:21.969 --> 01:35:25.551]  Please go to Amazon.com and avail yourself of this incredibly low price.
[01:35:25.631 --> 01:35:29.594]  I'm asking you, this is an action, I'm asking you to take today.
[01:35:30.014 --> 01:35:30.594]  Please do it.
[01:35:30.674 --> 01:35:31.915]  Again, InfoWars.com.
[01:35:32.555 --> 01:35:35.360]  Or if you don't have a computer you can always call toll free and get it from us.
[01:35:35.380 --> 01:35:35.420]  888-253-3139.
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:35.700]  888-253-3139.
[01:35:35.721 --> 01:35:37.664]  Now let's go ahead and go to Steve Watson.
[01:35:48.425 --> 01:35:55.855]  He wrote a great article, Will Doubletree Hotel Video Show Pentagon Impact, conflicting stories make it unclear, yet there are certainly more tapes to come.
[01:35:55.915 --> 01:35:57.798]  Why am I covering this in the middle of a big election?
[01:35:58.179 --> 01:35:59.040]  Because it's very important.
[01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:00.182]  They're saying they're going to release this.
[01:36:00.662 --> 01:36:02.104]  They're scheduled to release it November 9th.
[01:36:03.634 --> 01:36:06.216]  That would be on Thursday.
[01:36:06.836 --> 01:36:08.317]  Remember, what was it?
[01:36:08.477 --> 01:36:26.108]  Four months ago now, Judicial Watch got the release of another foggy five frames from the Pentagon from another little photo snap system that puts it on video, takes a photo every second or so.
[01:36:27.111 --> 01:36:34.544]  And they then, you just have to tell if you've, I guess who's coming to the parking lot, and it's just with some grey smudge, and they called it incontrovertible proof.
[01:36:34.685 --> 01:36:35.867]  I said that it looked like...
[01:36:36.613 --> 01:36:43.076]  And this is how Cloak & Dagger works, that they were trying to hype it even more and make people not believe a plane hit it even more.
[01:36:43.536 --> 01:36:47.358]  Hyping it to where this is what the 9-11 truth movement hinges on.
[01:36:47.698 --> 01:36:48.779]  Now that's not going to work.
[01:36:48.859 --> 01:36:50.460]  We've preemptively written articles about it.
[01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:51.340]  We've broken it down.
[01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:57.183]  But sure enough, they're talking about releasing another video this week, this time from the Doubletree, that's even clearer!
[01:36:58.969 --> 01:37:02.851]  And then perhaps this will heighten the debate even more, and then an even clearer video, an even clearer video.
[01:37:03.152 --> 01:37:06.874]  Whether it's real or fake or whatever it is, this is what they're doing.
[01:37:07.454 --> 01:37:11.797]  And it's very easy to fake video, but, and then, oh look, we disproved it, oh look, we showed them.
[01:37:12.197 --> 01:37:16.139]  Steve Watson's done a great analysis of this, I would add, Kurt Nemo's done a great analysis as well.
[01:37:16.559 --> 01:37:17.700]  Steve, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:37:18.661 --> 01:37:21.502]  Okay, Alex, it's great to be back.
[01:37:21.542 --> 01:37:24.424]  Break down your view, break down your analysis of this.
[01:37:26.209 --> 01:37:28.890]  Well, it was late last week, really.
[01:37:29.350 --> 01:37:47.135]  The blogs began to pick up on this and focus on the fact that sometime this week, according to, as you said, the Judicial Watch schedule, it's possible that a new video is going to come out that's going to show the impact, the actual impact of Flight 77 at the Pentagon.
[01:37:48.276 --> 01:37:52.957]  It was Judicial Watch, as well as others, that filed a Freedom of Information Act request
[01:37:54.009 --> 01:38:17.147]  Back in late 2004, seeking the release of all the records pertaining to recordings of all the cameras in the area of the Pentagon on 9-11, lawsuits have since been filed and to this day only two videos have been released.
[01:38:17.448 --> 01:38:22.712]  One of which was, as you said, the grainy footage from the parking lot, which was again
[01:38:23.365 --> 01:38:29.408]  Then released two years later the same footage and we were told it was different footage.
[01:38:30.609 --> 01:38:33.471]  It was just basically the whole length of the footage.
[01:38:33.511 --> 01:38:34.792]  It wasn't different, it was the same.
[01:38:35.712 --> 01:38:42.376]  And then last month a second video was released which didn't get a lot of coverage because it basically showed nothing.
[01:38:42.436 --> 01:38:50.160]  It was a gas station video which again was really hyped up for years and then was released and showed nothing.
[01:38:53.300 --> 01:39:02.304]  But this one that's due to be released sometime, we're told, before November 9th, in the next three days, is from the Doubletree Hotel.
[01:39:02.704 --> 01:39:05.245]  That's right, they could even release it tomorrow morning, we don't know.
[01:39:05.685 --> 01:39:14.068]  Well this is the point, they could release it tomorrow, and in the hope that they may want to sway voters if it shows anything.
[01:39:17.932 --> 01:39:20.533]  Because, make no mistake, 9-11 is a major issue.
[01:39:20.834 --> 01:39:25.376]  There are hundreds of candidates running in state and federal elections on 9-11 Truth.
[01:39:25.757 --> 01:39:29.279]  It is a major issue with voters not trusting this administration.
[01:39:30.580 --> 01:39:31.240]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:39:31.260 --> 01:39:40.146]  Now, it's been suggested that it's going to have some sort of clearer footage of an actual object hitting the building.
[01:39:43.513 --> 01:39:47.796]  I just think that this is another move to kind of muddy the waters on this issue.
[01:39:49.237 --> 01:39:57.824]  We already know that the FBI has released a statement pertaining to this specific video in which they admit that it doesn't show anything.
[01:39:58.565 --> 01:40:01.627]  And I've put that document in the article I wrote on Friday.
[01:40:02.288 --> 01:40:08.193]  It was a response to a separate Freedom of Information Act request by a different party.
[01:40:09.259 --> 01:40:13.862]  In which it specifically says that they determined that this video did not show the impact of Flight 77.
[01:40:13.902 --> 01:40:32.455]  So there's a lot of sort of debate over what this is going to actually show but from my sort of analysis of this it seems that it's going to be another sort of grainy thrown together piece of footage which is only going to really serve to hype up this argument.
[01:40:35.878 --> 01:40:36.418]  I mean if
[01:40:37.452 --> 01:40:46.894]  If this video does show something, then it's obvious that they've been caught in a lie because they've released this statement saying that it doesn't show something.
[01:40:46.914 --> 01:40:49.875]  So, it's not tallying up there.
[01:40:51.335 --> 01:40:57.676]  Also, the same statement said that the gas station video didn't show anything and that turned out to be the case.
[01:40:58.756 --> 01:41:01.617]  But why they've kept these videos under wraps for
[01:41:03.444 --> 01:41:07.385]  For more than, well, almost five years, if they show absolutely nothing.
[01:41:07.425 --> 01:41:08.866]  Why did they grab the videos?
[01:41:08.926 --> 01:41:10.987]  Why did they tell people not to talk about what they saw?
[01:41:11.047 --> 01:41:16.068]  Why did they pick up all the debris hurriedly while the building, you know, hadn't even collapsed yet?
[01:41:16.088 --> 01:41:19.849]  And why does the media always give attention to the Pentagon?
[01:41:19.869 --> 01:41:24.271]  They want to make this the central issue, and I've been saying that for five years.
[01:41:24.907 --> 01:41:36.096]  They don't want to look at 7, they don't want to look at CIA insider trading, they don't want to look at hijackers training US military bases, they want to make a whole movement hinge on this, and I've always said it's dangerous.
[01:41:37.698 --> 01:41:48.907]  Yeah, and this specific video has been further hyped up because of the fact that apparently there is a video from a hotel
[01:41:50.177 --> 01:41:54.920]  It's not specifically made clear which hotel it is, but apparently there is a video.
[01:41:54.940 --> 01:41:55.921]  It's the Sheraton, yeah.
[01:41:56.361 --> 01:42:02.024]  Yeah, that does show the impact, and this is being reported in the Washington Times.
[01:42:02.164 --> 01:42:09.489]  So why are they holding back, releasing all the videos that they say don't show a plane, or show a blur, and they say it's a plane.
[01:42:09.829 --> 01:42:17.494]  Again, they release something that doesn't show a plane, knowing it'll hype it, then they release a gas station video that shows nothing but a flash, then they release
[01:42:17.974 --> 01:42:22.317]  Yeah, well they've admitted that they've got, in addition to these two, they've got another 83 videos.
[01:42:22.337 --> 01:42:26.279]  So, I mean, they've got endless amounts of videos that they can release and play with and do what they want with.
[01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:47.081]  There's ongoing lawsuits.
[01:42:47.241 --> 01:42:50.083]  All of them should have been released now.
[01:42:50.103 --> 01:42:53.004]  It's not under national security anymore.
[01:42:53.044 --> 01:42:54.465]  They all should be public.
[01:42:54.885 --> 01:42:58.267]  It just shows that they'll just release whatever they want, whenever they want.
[01:43:01.489 --> 01:43:02.729]  You're absolutely right.
[01:43:03.290 --> 01:43:06.671]  What do you predict is going to happen, or what's your dead reckoning estimation?
[01:43:08.232 --> 01:43:13.495]  Well, I think it may show something, but again, it's just going to be
[01:43:15.140 --> 01:43:31.689]  It's just going to be a blur, it's just going to hype it up and they're going to have their mouthpieces out sort of spreading propaganda really and hyping up the debate when really we should be concentrating on the cold hard facts of the movement that have got us to where we are now.
[01:43:31.709 --> 01:43:41.654]  Because the danger is that they'll then release, later on they'll release an even clearer piece of video which, you know, will be battered down and
[01:43:43.226 --> 01:43:52.689]  They'll go around saying that they've won the debate, but... I mean, on the other hand, they could let this go on forever, like they have with... you know, with sealing the Kennedy assassination records.
[01:43:52.789 --> 01:44:00.611]  It's... It's a... It's a tool that they're using, and we really need to focus on... on the other aspects of 9-11 to get the truth out.
[01:44:02.958 --> 01:44:03.959]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:44:04.039 --> 01:44:10.444]  Shifting gears, this report, we must debate mercy killings of disabled babies, say top doctors.
[01:44:10.504 --> 01:44:11.445]  It's already going on.
[01:44:11.485 --> 01:44:20.331]  I like a little picture of Charlotte Waite, there in her wheelchair, the poor little thing with her parents, as the government demands that the child die.
[01:44:20.351 --> 01:44:27.237]  I haven't seen that, actually.
[01:44:27.417 --> 01:44:28.938]  Is that on the website now?
[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:38.202]  Yes, but certainly you've seen, being in England, the whole national discussion about how the government wants to set the precedent that they decide when to euthanize someone.
[01:44:40.483 --> 01:44:51.726]  Well, yeah, I mean, it's a debate that they've been having for a while, whether they should be, you know, and they've been doing these kind of things in other European countries, and whether they should be assisting suicide and things.
[01:44:52.702 --> 01:44:53.283]  Listen to this.
[01:44:53.383 --> 01:44:57.947]  We must debate mercy killings of disabled babies, say top doctors.
[01:44:58.027 --> 01:45:02.130]  A doctor's group called today for a debate on the mercy killing of disabled babies.
[01:45:02.510 --> 01:45:09.756]  The medical profession should examine the act of euthanasia of desperately ill newborns, said the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecology.
[01:45:10.357 --> 01:45:15.962]  It wants an inquiry into whether the deliberate intervention to cause the death of an infant should be legalized.
[01:45:15.982 --> 01:45:17.083]  Well, it already is quasi.
[01:45:17.703 --> 01:45:20.786]  The proposal met with furious response from some quarters last night.
[01:45:21.246 --> 01:45:30.033]  Labor MP, the Member of Parliament, Jim Dobbin, compared it to eugenics policies of the Nazis, who I would add the Nazis got their ideas from the US and England.
[01:45:30.534 --> 01:45:35.057]  This sends the message that only the perfect are acceptable and the disabled can be discarded.
[01:45:35.558 --> 01:45:43.665]  The college suggested that decisions on when young babies should be killed or allowed to die should depend not only on the gravity of their condition.
[01:45:44.765 --> 01:45:46.507]  Not only on the gravity of their condition.
[01:45:47.225 --> 01:46:03.528]  It goes on, and it goes on to say, uh, it's suspension to an inquiry on the ethics of treatment for severely ill and disabled newborns raises the question of whether such children should be killed if they are not wanted by their parents.
[01:46:04.128 --> 01:46:14.590]  The study comes against the background of a growing acceptance of the idea of euthanasia, suicide, and hastening of death for mortally sick adults and the dying elderly.
[01:46:15.313 --> 01:46:24.259]  The college said that euthanasia in babies is assisted dying legislation is to be anticipated or enacted at the other end of life.
[01:46:24.999 --> 01:46:30.403]  Now would be a pertinent time to discuss this issue.
[01:46:32.137 --> 01:46:37.199]  I mean, we already warehouse our old, we already, most people don't visit their parents when there's nothing even wrong with them.
[01:46:37.499 --> 01:46:45.722]  They're killing people all over this country who are openly strapped down begging for food and water that most Americans don't even know that's been in the Wall Street Journal, Steve.
[01:46:47.163 --> 01:46:52.565]  Well, that is literally the move into Huxley's Brave New World Society, isn't it?
[01:46:54.105 --> 01:46:57.546]  And it is, to the word, it is what Hitler wrote down.
[01:46:57.586 --> 01:46:58.467]  It's Hitler's plan.
[01:46:58.667 --> 01:46:58.907]  I mean,
[01:47:00.495 --> 01:47:01.075]  You don't have to.
[01:47:01.196 --> 01:47:05.579]  All you have to do is, you know, a few hours of research to know that this is what it is.
[01:47:05.659 --> 01:47:15.065]  And it's been implemented already in hospitals, from what I've read, in Holland, I think it is, and European countries like that.
[01:47:15.085 --> 01:47:23.231]  And of course we know that the plan is to harmonize European countries and harmonize... Yeah, they're merging all the laws.
[01:47:24.555 --> 01:47:31.138]  They're talking about basically killing anybody who's got a serious illness or who's paralyzed.
[01:47:31.578 --> 01:47:40.582]  I mean, this is openly being discussed and it fits right in with the Dr. Pianca agenda of reducing population forcibly, if need be, by 90%.
[01:47:40.663 --> 01:47:41.823]  He's seen as a moderate.
[01:47:42.223 --> 01:47:43.604]  Some are even saying more than 90%.
[01:47:44.284 --> 01:47:49.006]  This is the accepted view by academia in the West, Steve.
[01:47:49.026 --> 01:47:52.368]  Yeah, it's a scary proposition.
[01:47:53.576 --> 01:47:57.342]  Well, you know, Hitler did start with retarded children, with the paralyzed.
[01:47:57.883 --> 01:47:59.085]  That's where it all started in 1934.
[01:48:01.309 --> 01:48:03.310]  And that's how they set the precedent to do this.
[01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:07.612]  So I hope that everybody out there listening realizes that you're going to end up in this position.
[01:48:08.052 --> 01:48:21.037]  I mean, I know a lot of people who are disabled who lead very good lives, but even if they don't lead what you'd call a, quote, good life as the bioethicist board's demon, you cannot allow this precedent to be set to have the state killing people.
[01:48:21.057 --> 01:48:24.559]  You notice they have the debate about, oh, if you want to die, we should let you.
[01:48:24.779 --> 01:48:29.441]  And now within a year of that being accepted in polls, oh, well, we'll kill you.
[01:48:33.973 --> 01:48:50.663]  Yeah, I mean, if you look into eugenics, the term eugenics has a lot of different meanings, but really, the eugenics that they're talking about now, and that we know of now, were the plans of the Nazis.
[01:48:52.284 --> 01:48:53.764]  In Europe, in the 1930s.
[01:48:55.325 --> 01:49:01.729]  And if you read back and look at what eugenics is, there are many different aspects to it, but
[01:49:02.170 --> 01:49:04.171]  These are the ones that are being forced upon us now.
[01:49:05.652 --> 01:49:07.754]  Well, we've got to stand up and say no to this.
[01:49:07.794 --> 01:49:08.895]  We've got to do it immediately.
[01:49:08.935 --> 01:49:13.358]  Steve, I know you're going to be tracking the Pentagon video story the day it comes out, the next few days.
[01:49:13.378 --> 01:49:14.538]  I know you'll do a report on it.
[01:49:15.179 --> 01:49:25.026]  And we're going to be watching all the different election fraud reports that are now streaming out in the next few days and reporting on those at InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.com, and InfoWars.com.
[01:49:25.326 --> 01:49:26.927]  Thank you for joining us from London.
[01:49:26.947 --> 01:49:29.849]  I want to speak to you briefly during the break, but thanks for coming on.
[01:49:30.566 --> 01:49:31.007]  Thanks Alex.

[01:49:57.592 --> 01:50:05.256]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:05.936 --> 01:50:12.999]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:13.379 --> 01:50:16.340]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:50:16.721 --> 01:50:19.021]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:50:19.442 --> 01:50:20.282]  NSA spies.
[01:50:20.754 --> 01:50:24.797]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.

[01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:31.001]  It's an anthology of government crimes.

[01:53:17.964 --> 01:53:18.685]  I'm going to do it right now.
[01:53:18.745 --> 01:53:19.265]  You watch.
[01:53:19.325 --> 01:53:21.967]  I'm going to take three calls before this segment ends.
[01:53:22.447 --> 01:53:25.629]  I hope you'll go up on InfoWars.com and link through to Amazon.com.
[01:53:25.649 --> 01:53:27.210]  We got into the top ten on Friday.
[01:53:27.710 --> 01:53:30.813]  I didn't promote it over the weekend, and we dropped down to the fifties and sixties.
[01:53:30.873 --> 01:53:32.093]  I'm going to drive it to number one.
[01:53:32.434 --> 01:53:33.054]  Help me do it.
[01:53:33.114 --> 01:53:37.497]  Order TerrorStorm for $11.19 at Amazon.com right now.
[01:53:37.837 --> 01:53:40.679]  Let's talk to George and then Dale and Alex and others.
[01:53:41.059 --> 01:53:42.580]  George in Indiana, you're on the air.
[01:53:42.620 --> 01:53:42.960]  Welcome.
[01:53:43.961 --> 01:53:44.542]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:53:44.842 --> 01:53:46.423]  I've been getting my video around.
[01:53:47.305 --> 01:53:55.448]  Or the videos around a lot of the people down here, but I want to tell you, I had visions of mice and men when this guy that disagreed with you came on.
[01:53:55.468 --> 01:53:59.430]  He is absolutely the target that they would go after.
[01:53:59.490 --> 01:54:08.974]  Somebody that's so dumbed down that would walk into the oven, take his clothes off, mark his shoes, make sure everything's going to be there when he comes back out again.
[01:54:09.774 --> 01:54:13.756]  You know, the number one thing that's killing people across this country right now
[01:54:14.418 --> 01:54:42.166]  is uh... infections in hospitals and they don't even let you know it might not have tried years ago three of the government admits that over three hundred thousand people a year that's more than cars folks are dying of infections i know tons of people who are healthy as horses that go in for knee surgery and die because of the superbugs that live in the hospital they call them sick buildings i'm sorry go ahead you were saying about your dad, sorry
[01:54:42.466 --> 01:54:48.849]  The day before he died, I walked in and watched two nurses wiping down everything with gloves and then going to his catheter.
[01:54:49.229 --> 01:54:50.550]  The catheter was bright red.
[01:54:50.770 --> 01:54:51.791]  I mean, it was pure blood.
[01:54:53.111 --> 01:55:00.995]  And you know, in the bathroom, it said a little note up on the mirror that said, make sure to wash your hands.
[01:55:01.035 --> 01:55:02.536]  Well, that has nothing to do with it.
[01:55:02.596 --> 01:55:07.218]  You've seen surgeons stand there and wash their hands 15, 20 minutes before they go into surgery.
[01:55:07.558 --> 01:55:11.080]  So a nurse washing her hands before she touches something is not really going to do anything.
[01:55:11.832 --> 01:55:13.874]  Well, and it's not just the normal bugs.
[01:55:13.914 --> 01:55:21.319]  You have decades of people eating, gobbling antibiotics, and when you have any type of other procedure, they give you antibiotics.
[01:55:21.660 --> 01:55:24.502]  And it has bred superbugs, and where do the superbugs live?
[01:55:24.842 --> 01:55:26.163]  They live in these hospitals.
[01:55:27.204 --> 01:55:29.586]  And that's what's dangerous about these hospitals.
[01:55:29.706 --> 01:55:37.532]  And there's only three or four states right now where they're requiring them to disclose what the person died of.
[01:55:37.592 --> 01:55:40.154]  Otherwise, you hear the word sepsis a lot, and that's
[01:55:41.388 --> 01:55:42.529]  A bacterial poisoning.
[01:55:42.569 --> 01:55:46.212]  It's a virus that they're picking up in there.
[01:55:46.252 --> 01:55:46.392]  Yeah.
[01:55:46.412 --> 01:55:48.774]  And then over 200,000 people die from medical malpractice.
[01:55:48.794 --> 01:55:54.518]  So that's 500 plus thousand people who are dying.
[01:55:54.558 --> 01:55:56.640]  The most dangerous place to be is in a hospital.
[01:55:56.680 --> 01:55:58.001]  And I'm not saying they can't help you.
[01:55:58.021 --> 01:56:00.403]  I'm not saying there aren't good doctors and nurses.
[01:56:01.024 --> 01:56:04.006]  I'm saying that the system is a fraud and very dangerous.
[01:56:04.286 --> 01:56:05.247]  And they don't want to fix it.
[01:56:06.036 --> 01:56:07.117]  Hey, I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:56:07.137 --> 01:56:07.797]  Good to hear from you.
[01:56:08.178 --> 01:56:12.381]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dale in Pennsylvania.
[01:56:12.401 --> 01:56:13.061]  Dale, go ahead.
[01:56:13.081 --> 01:56:14.342]  Hello, Alex.
[01:56:14.602 --> 01:56:14.903]  Hi.
[01:56:14.923 --> 01:56:17.084]  How's it going, man?
[01:56:17.204 --> 01:56:20.126]  I was just wondering... It's an honor to talk to you, first of all.
[01:56:20.166 --> 01:56:20.747]  Oh, please.
[01:56:20.807 --> 01:56:21.107]  Come on.
[01:56:21.247 --> 01:56:23.409]  It is an honor, man.
[01:56:23.449 --> 01:56:24.630]  You're the one who woke me up.
[01:56:25.130 --> 01:56:27.812]  And I want to say that thank you, first of all.
[01:56:28.292 --> 01:56:33.296]  And I want to talk to you about the elections and how they're having them voting systems.
[01:56:33.516 --> 01:56:34.056]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:56:35.333 --> 01:56:37.474]  Well, they got them electronic voting systems.
[01:56:38.354 --> 01:56:41.055]  And the people, they don't, they're all sheep.
[01:56:41.375 --> 01:56:43.815]  They don't know about how it's all controlled.
[01:56:44.636 --> 01:56:47.476]  They're just going to go out there and vote come November 6th.
[01:56:48.076 --> 01:56:50.117]  It's November the 7th.
[01:56:51.397 --> 01:56:55.658]  They're going to go out there and vote, and they're not going to know where their vote's going to.
[01:56:55.859 --> 01:56:59.420]  Like, you said before, Al.
[01:57:00.940 --> 01:57:01.140]  Yeah?
[01:57:03.735 --> 01:57:06.696]  Well, I mean, we can say people are sheep, and I appreciate your call.
[01:57:06.736 --> 01:57:08.117]  I'm glad to hear we woke you up, my friend.
[01:57:08.517 --> 01:57:09.497]  You can say they're all sheep.
[01:57:09.537 --> 01:57:10.178]  A lot of them are.
[01:57:10.218 --> 01:57:13.399]  But they just had a poll a few weeks ago.
[01:57:13.759 --> 01:57:17.541]  Scientific over 90% don't trust the voting machines.
[01:57:17.581 --> 01:57:18.701]  They want a paper ballot.
[01:57:19.021 --> 01:57:19.842]  They want a record.
[01:57:19.862 --> 01:57:21.863]  I mean, we're going to win this fight.
[01:57:21.883 --> 01:57:22.503]  We're going to win.
[01:57:23.883 --> 01:57:25.444]  The globalists have overplayed their hand.
[01:57:25.604 --> 01:57:27.105]  Third hour, 70 seconds away.
[01:57:28.524 --> 01:57:33.128]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:33.148 --> 01:57:33.649]  Big Brother.
[01:57:33.849 --> 01:57:34.630]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:34.710 --> 01:57:37.792]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:40.174 --> 01:57:43.337]  You want answers?
[01:57:51.312 --> 01:57:52.192]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:52.212 --> 01:57:56.494]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:57.055 --> 01:58:01.177]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:04.878 --> 01:58:17.544]  Everyone in Central Texas who subscribes to the worthless Austin American Statesman got a paid-for by taxpayer dollars propaganda pamphlet
[01:58:18.271 --> 01:58:27.977]  Showing a smiling woman with this idiot smile, totally fake, with her hands on the steering wheel in a convertible driving through the hill country.
[01:58:28.697 --> 01:58:32.079]  The wonderful new toll roads, the first legs have opened.
[01:58:32.099 --> 01:58:37.422]  I want to talk about how they're domesticating us all over the country, how they're using this.
[01:58:38.223 --> 01:58:42.405]  More on election fraud news, it's coming out, some of the dirty tricks the Republicans are playing.
[01:58:43.812 --> 01:58:44.593]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[01:58:44.653 --> 01:58:44.853]  Good.
[01:58:44.873 --> 01:58:48.295]  Actually, I wanted some advice on how to look at the candidates because, honestly, I haven't been really
[01:59:13.215 --> 01:59:17.357]  Up to date on my candidates in my state and county.
[01:59:18.098 --> 01:59:21.840]  But what are good questions that you should ask these people?
[01:59:22.480 --> 01:59:23.621]  And what should you look for?
[01:59:23.641 --> 01:59:28.023]  Because I know they always talk about prescription drugs and we know that's bad.
[01:59:28.043 --> 01:59:31.284]  Yeah, you don't want to hear what they're offering to give you, number one.
[01:59:31.785 --> 01:59:38.588]  You want to vote against most Republicans, unless you know their voting record and they're pro-Second Amendment, pro-border control.
[01:59:39.109 --> 01:59:39.869]  Most of them aren't.
[01:59:40.572 --> 01:59:42.513]  You want to vote out incumbents generally.
[01:59:42.553 --> 01:59:45.653]  I mean, if there's a Democrat who's an incumbent, vote for the Republican.
[01:59:45.673 --> 01:59:49.054]  If there's a Republican who's an incumbent, vote for the Democrat.
[01:59:49.714 --> 01:59:53.916]  I would vote for third parties when you don't have a good Republican or Democrat to vote for.
[01:59:54.496 --> 02:00:00.157]  And really, just a few hours away from the election, it's kind of hard for me to tell you who to vote for locally.
[02:00:00.697 --> 02:00:02.998]  It's hard for me to even know the landscape where I live.
[02:00:03.658 --> 02:00:06.259]  It takes a lot of study, and I don't have all the answers there.
[02:00:06.949 --> 02:00:17.342]  But I just know this, instead of us all focusing on federal elections with 50-60% turnouts, how about we have 50% turnouts locally, in local elections, which we normally don't.
[02:00:17.362 --> 02:00:18.884]  We have like an 8% turnout.
[02:00:19.144 --> 02:00:20.446]  Like for your mayors and stuff.
[02:00:21.098 --> 02:00:24.060]  Yes, that's where you can really have an effect, where you can learn the issues.
[02:00:25.161 --> 02:00:26.922]  You don't want more bond proposals.
[02:00:26.942 --> 02:00:28.563]  You don't want more funding for police.
[02:00:29.064 --> 02:00:32.806]  You don't want day labor sites funding illegal aliens.
[02:00:33.647 --> 02:00:35.268]  You want less government.
[02:00:35.768 --> 02:00:44.174]  Because that's the mechanism, no matter how good the plan sounds for you, that's the mechanism, the nexus point they use to get a hold of you and your life.
[02:00:44.781 --> 02:00:53.046]  Now, could some of these state representatives, could they honestly, truthfully think that they're doing the right thing and they're being taught the wrong thing?
[02:00:53.506 --> 02:00:54.967]  Yeah, a lot of them are useful idiots.
[02:00:55.007 --> 02:00:55.848]  I appreciate your call.
[02:00:56.188 --> 02:00:59.190]  They just listen to political consultants that tell them what winners do.
[02:01:00.379 --> 02:01:02.840]  Let's go ahead and talk to Andrew in Nebraska.
[02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:03.581]  Andrew, welcome.
[02:01:03.961 --> 02:01:04.661]  Hey, Alex.
[02:01:04.701 --> 02:01:05.962]  Thanks a lot for taking my call.
[02:01:06.242 --> 02:01:15.266]  Hey, I just had a quick analysis, or whatever you want to call it, on what's happening with Saddam Hussein and the whole trial and him getting charged.
[02:01:15.626 --> 02:01:17.547]  And I totally agree with you as far as him.
[02:01:17.867 --> 02:01:21.049]  You know, Grant, he's probably guilty, but essentially he's just following orders.
[02:01:21.129 --> 02:01:28.492]  And it reminds me of the 1993 World Trade Center bombings, where if you look at the facts, you look at the documents,
[02:01:28.934 --> 02:01:42.050]  It shows that, I believe it was Ramsey Yosef or something, probably pronouncing that wrong, but how he was just directed by the FBI to follow these orders and he's just kind of following orders and granted he's guilty.
[02:01:43.151 --> 02:01:44.513]  It was Ahmad Salam.
[02:01:45.334 --> 02:01:47.716]  Right, there you go, I'm sorry, my bad, wrong name.
[02:01:48.584 --> 02:01:54.770]  But, uh, you know, essentially... Yeah, the FBI put in a bomb, trained the driver, gave him the explosives, gave him the detonators, and he thought it was a sting.
[02:01:54.790 --> 02:01:58.053]  They pulled him off, and he recorded them telling him to let it go forward.
[02:01:58.493 --> 02:01:59.614]  Sure, sure, definitely.
[02:01:59.714 --> 02:02:07.961]  So, and just a real quick plug, if you don't mind me making, uh, there's a website I have that kind of documents the Franklin cover up here in Omaha, where I'm at.
[02:02:08.282 --> 02:02:10.023]  Uh, it's FranklinCase.org.
[02:02:10.704 --> 02:02:12.806]  Uh, FranklinCase.org, so...
[02:02:13.593 --> 02:02:14.534]  Yeah, I've been to that site.
[02:02:14.574 --> 02:02:15.914]  I should have you on as a guest sometime.
[02:02:16.154 --> 02:02:17.075]  Yeah, that'd be awesome.
[02:02:17.175 --> 02:02:17.515]  Thanks a lot.
[02:02:17.595 --> 02:02:18.475]  I really appreciate it.
[02:02:18.495 --> 02:02:19.176]  Hey, thank you.
[02:02:19.396 --> 02:02:20.076]  Thank you, Andrew.
[02:02:20.116 --> 02:02:20.857]  Good to hear from you.
[02:02:21.377 --> 02:02:22.357]  Good point you brought up.
[02:02:22.998 --> 02:02:25.179]  Wesleyan, Idaho and others, your calls are straight ahead.
[02:02:25.279 --> 02:02:27.320]  Wide open phones today.
[02:02:27.340 --> 02:02:30.881]  In fact, I'm going to take five or six calls in the next segment.
[02:02:30.901 --> 02:02:31.062]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:31.122 --> 02:02:32.682]  Lots of news coming up as well.
[02:02:32.722 --> 02:02:33.143]  Stay with us.
[02:02:43.715 --> 02:02:44.175]  It's here!
[02:02:44.395 --> 02:02:49.176]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:49.536 --> 02:02:57.198]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:02:57.878 --> 02:03:04.919]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:05.340 --> 02:03:12.221]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:03:12.717 --> 02:03:16.738]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:17.058 --> 02:03:20.579]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:21.019 --> 02:03:22.940]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:27.201]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:40.179 --> 02:04:45.044]  The Japanese have used magnetic therapy for thousands of years, and it's more popular today than ever before.
[02:04:45.244 --> 02:04:53.512]  Established in 2000, Arizona Unipol Magnetics, AUM, is the number one online source for the superb Dr. Philpott-approved polar power magnetics.
[02:04:53.852 --> 02:04:57.953]  Now offering a complete line of these fine magnetics in an easy-to-read mail-order catalog.
[02:04:58.153 --> 02:05:01.354]  No hyped-up product descriptions to waste your time, just the facts.
[02:05:01.714 --> 02:05:09.076]  Unique polar-powered magnetics are designed to apply only the negative magnetic field to the body, and they're the only magnetics used in Dr. Philpott's research.
[02:05:09.236 --> 02:05:17.239]  Proven safe with over 23 years of documented research, now GCM listeners can order the Polar-Powered Ceramic Block Biomagnet and get a discount.
[02:05:17.359 --> 02:05:19.479]  This is the workhorse of all biomagnets.
[02:05:19.739 --> 02:05:21.560]  Just mention GCM when you place your order.
[02:05:21.920 --> 02:05:26.724]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:26.744 --> 02:05:27.244]  Not only
[02:05:51.445 --> 02:05:55.626]  Did HR 6166 abolish the Bill of Rights in its entirety?
[02:05:57.207 --> 02:06:05.629]  The Military Appropriations Act, signed October 17th, puts the military over control of the U.S.
[02:06:06.349 --> 02:06:10.090]  Going back several years, their new passport rules were to
[02:06:11.360 --> 02:06:13.101]  Go even on a fishing boat.
[02:06:13.181 --> 02:06:17.863]  Let's say you go to Port Aransas, Texas and you want to go out 50 miles on one of those day fishing boats.
[02:06:17.903 --> 02:06:20.264]  They're claiming the local fishing boats.
[02:06:20.285 --> 02:06:27.328]  You're going to have to have a passport and they're going to have to have computers to swipe your passport to decide if you're even allowed to go out to sea.
[02:06:29.349 --> 02:06:30.830]  This is the incredible control.
[02:06:33.971 --> 02:06:39.154]  New Homeland Security rules where they're going to swipe your passport when you go anywhere.
[02:06:40.350 --> 02:06:41.911]  It'll be much worse than the no-fly list.
[02:06:42.592 --> 02:06:45.574]  I mean, we're going into real, live tyranny.
[02:06:46.934 --> 02:06:48.375]  But the borders are wide open.
[02:06:50.057 --> 02:06:53.979]  Why did Vicente Fox two years ago come to Austin and give a big award to Wells Fargo?
[02:06:54.860 --> 02:07:03.886]  Because they issue debit cards to the illegal aliens with no IDs that then are used to get houses, to get loans, to work in this country.
[02:07:04.810 --> 02:07:06.751]  Total legalization of all illegals.
[02:07:07.572 --> 02:07:11.495]  Citizens are total slaves!
[02:07:11.575 --> 02:07:13.336]  Transponders are going to go in all the cars.
[02:07:13.396 --> 02:07:14.677]  Taxes as we go down the road.
[02:07:14.697 --> 02:07:18.780]  They're going to have federal Viper teams on the street running random checkpoints.
[02:07:21.202 --> 02:07:23.343]  You see, criminals took control of the government.
[02:07:23.363 --> 02:07:25.485]  They want to make sure now that you're starting to wake up to them.
[02:07:25.505 --> 02:07:27.186]  They're going to make sure you can't resist.
[02:07:27.886 --> 02:07:30.388]  So they can continue their criminality and expand it.
[02:07:30.808 --> 02:07:32.589]  It's called the T-word.
[02:07:32.830 --> 02:07:33.230]  Tyranny.
[02:07:34.005 --> 02:07:34.746]  Despotism.
[02:07:36.047 --> 02:07:42.514]  Let's go back to your calls as we follow the election and the staged Saddam trial for the election, just all of it.
[02:07:43.014 --> 02:07:46.317]  I've got six or is it seven mainstream media reports here.
[02:07:46.458 --> 02:07:53.625]  It's admitted that Republicans, because there's a law where for political speech, which I agree with, you can't block telemarketers,
[02:07:54.671 --> 02:08:04.180]  So they have calls acting like they're Democrats, recorded calls saying horrible policies they don't support, being really obnoxious, and they'll call someone three times in a row.
[02:08:05.301 --> 02:08:13.969]  And they're calling Democratic voters with the pro-Democratic candidate thing being real obnoxious, and they admit it's a dirty trick and just say, so what?
[02:08:13.989 --> 02:08:18.193]  See, things that were hidden in the background now are just, yeah, we're criminals, what are you going to do?
[02:08:20.493 --> 02:08:22.415]  North Com's now in control!
[02:08:23.095 --> 02:08:27.278]  We've got huge microwave-mounted guns ready to fry you in the streets!
[02:08:27.939 --> 02:08:31.321]  We've got our helicopters with knockout gas in every major city ready!
[02:08:31.602 --> 02:08:34.103]  We've got cameras everywhere in even small towns!
[02:08:34.544 --> 02:08:35.364]  It's slavery!
[02:08:35.404 --> 02:08:36.285]  Learn to kneel!
[02:08:37.166 --> 02:08:38.066]  Learn to take it!
[02:08:38.086 --> 02:08:41.609]  I'm not kidding!
[02:08:42.950 --> 02:08:45.192]  And yeah, we're gonna euthanize the babies and the old people!
[02:08:45.862 --> 02:08:51.883]  And now we're going to force vaccines on you, and now we're going to force psychological testing, and now we're going to search your house without warrants!
[02:08:53.244 --> 02:08:55.264]  It's a new America, didn't you hear?
[02:08:55.284 --> 02:09:02.106]  And we're going to give all the illegals national ID cards, and you're going to take them too!
[02:09:02.126 --> 02:09:07.327]  Let's talk to Wesley in Idaho, then Ed, Joseph, and others.
[02:09:07.347 --> 02:09:07.987]  Go ahead, Wesley.
[02:09:08.747 --> 02:09:09.388]  Yes, Alex.
[02:09:09.588 --> 02:09:10.008]  Hi.
[02:09:10.808 --> 02:09:14.709]  Congratulations on the success of your film, Terror Storm.
[02:09:15.936 --> 02:09:20.417]  Do you include the Levant Affair, 1954, or King David Hotel?
[02:09:20.437 --> 02:09:26.239]  No, I do know about the Levant Affair, and we couldn't put every false flag in the film.
[02:09:26.639 --> 02:09:30.721]  Why don't you tell people about the Levant Affair, and then the other issue you mentioned.
[02:09:32.161 --> 02:09:33.422]  Thank you.
[02:09:33.442 --> 02:09:37.243]  In 1954, Israelis set up bombs in U.S.
[02:09:37.583 --> 02:09:43.845]  facilities in Egypt, and intentionally left behind evidence to implicate Arabs.
[02:09:44.864 --> 02:09:57.127]  And in 1946, in the King David Hotel, once again, Israelis, this time, well, same, dressed as Arabs, bombed the hotel, killing 91.
[02:09:58.127 --> 02:10:05.629]  This is a perfect example of false flag operations when they dress up as someone else.
[02:10:07.110 --> 02:10:11.671]  On the subject of Saddam, isn't this a phony Saddam?
[02:10:12.714 --> 02:10:23.577]  Google in the words Shaddam Scam and you will find pictures that it appears this Shaddam is not the real Shaddam.
[02:10:24.257 --> 02:10:27.538]  Well I know the teeth are more crooked than in earlier photos now.
[02:10:28.038 --> 02:10:31.379]  I know Shaddam admittedly had more than 20 doubles.
[02:10:32.939 --> 02:10:34.200]  This guy is an actor.
[02:10:34.820 --> 02:10:35.460]  He's great.
[02:10:37.147 --> 02:10:37.968]  I don't know what to believe.
[02:10:37.988 --> 02:10:40.290]  We know they staged the capture of this Saddam.
[02:10:40.310 --> 02:10:41.111]  That's now admitted.
[02:10:41.531 --> 02:10:50.260]  The Kurds had whoever this was in the north three weeks before and then we even see the special forces colonel
[02:10:51.511 --> 02:10:58.899]  Excuse me, the Marine Force Recon Colonel saying, we've got to pull that video back up, we wrote a bunch of articles about it, saying, okay, here's the story.
[02:10:59.179 --> 02:11:00.120]  He was in that hole.
[02:11:00.501 --> 02:11:01.522]  We found him in that hole.
[02:11:01.622 --> 02:11:02.563]  Do you understand?
[02:11:02.583 --> 02:11:03.904]  That's all you say.
[02:11:04.285 --> 02:11:04.845]  Yes, sir.
[02:11:04.925 --> 02:11:05.626]  Let me say it again.
[02:11:05.686 --> 02:11:06.467]  He was in that hole.
[02:11:08.146 --> 02:11:10.748]  And the embedded reporter I guess got that out too early.
[02:11:11.569 --> 02:11:13.591]  But we heard it was staged, then it was admitted.
[02:11:13.671 --> 02:11:20.256]  Okay, he was captured before and put in the hole, and then they staged it all for the cameras to make him look pathetic for the Arab world.
[02:11:20.856 --> 02:11:21.797]  Is it a real Saddam?
[02:11:21.957 --> 02:11:22.498]  I don't know.
[02:11:23.078 --> 02:11:29.523]  The point is, the people think it is, so just taking that argument, okay, Saddam worked for the globalists, it was all staged.
[02:11:29.864 --> 02:11:33.607]  If our government gave the orders to him to do all this, then how do we give him the death penalty?
[02:11:35.543 --> 02:11:42.006]  For your listeners out there, once again, Google in Shaddam Scam and look at the pictures and you decide.
[02:11:42.746 --> 02:11:51.210]  An excellent 9-1-1 Truth Candidate in Ohio for Congress is Jim Condit.
[02:11:51.390 --> 02:11:52.150]  Yeah, we got him on.
[02:11:52.610 --> 02:11:53.291]  Oh, great.
[02:11:53.671 --> 02:11:54.191]  I didn't know.
[02:11:54.211 --> 02:11:57.993]  His website is realnews247.com.
[02:12:00.434 --> 02:12:05.136]  For the last question, did the Nazis use
[02:12:05.802 --> 02:12:08.150]  Homicidal gas chambers in World War II.
[02:12:08.972 --> 02:12:12.222]  There have been, I know it's some of the camps where they claimed they did.
[02:12:13.448 --> 02:12:19.151]  The Russians now admit that they, quote, reconstructed them, so there's a large debate swarming around that.
[02:12:19.191 --> 02:12:29.876]  Also, they claim the original six million number came from a claim that six million by the Russians were killed at Auschwitz, and they later had to reduce that to one million, and then somehow six became the number.
[02:12:31.077 --> 02:12:37.960]  Regardless, I think Hitler was a bad guy, and did kill a bunch of people, and was set up by the globalists.
[02:12:38.740 --> 02:12:43.023]  I don't think people should be arrested, though, for their views.
[02:12:43.063 --> 02:12:51.208]  If you want to say a billion people died under Hitler, which isn't true, or if you want to say only five people died, which isn't true either, I think it's your right, free speech, to say it.
[02:12:52.029 --> 02:12:55.691]  Well, Jim Condit did an excellent DVD on Hitler.
[02:12:55.711 --> 02:12:58.533]  He was a quarter Jew.
[02:12:58.633 --> 02:12:59.954]  He tried to cover it up.
[02:13:00.454 --> 02:13:07.379]  And whether or not he was really sincere about his hatred to Jews or not is
[02:13:08.223 --> 02:13:21.008]  It's hard to prove, really, because the result was he helped set up this false state of Israel.
[02:13:21.108 --> 02:13:22.549]  Yeah, it's admitted now.
[02:13:22.809 --> 02:13:25.250]  Even top academia have written books on it, best sellers.
[02:13:25.610 --> 02:13:26.550]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:13:27.630 --> 02:13:28.771]  I've really got to move on to the callers.
[02:13:28.791 --> 02:13:32.092]  To be fair, like I said earlier, I'm going to really move quicker, and I actually had you on for five minutes.
[02:13:33.573 --> 02:13:34.573]  That's a whole other show.
[02:13:35.413 --> 02:13:36.574]  I don't like Adolf Hitler.
[02:13:37.245 --> 02:13:38.646]  I don't like what Adolf Hitler did.
[02:13:38.666 --> 02:13:40.646]  Adolf Hitler was into the occult.
[02:13:40.666 --> 02:13:41.647]  He was very, very evil.
[02:13:42.507 --> 02:13:46.328]  But our own government and the President's own grandfather helped fund Hitler.
[02:13:46.869 --> 02:13:48.449]  And I know 20 million Germans died.
[02:13:48.469 --> 02:13:51.410]  I know millions and millions of Poles died.
[02:13:51.450 --> 02:13:53.491]  I know millions of Jews died.
[02:13:53.691 --> 02:13:54.551]  The number is debatable.
[02:13:55.432 --> 02:13:57.713]  But we know the Russians killed more people than Hitler did.
[02:13:58.333 --> 02:13:58.893]  They're all bad.
[02:13:59.894 --> 02:14:02.256]  Let's go ahead and continue with your calls.
[02:14:02.837 --> 02:14:05.639]  Let's talk to Ed in Pennsylvania.
[02:14:05.699 --> 02:14:06.259]  Ed, go ahead.
[02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:07.140]  Hi, Alex.
[02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:07.660]  How are you doing?
[02:14:07.900 --> 02:14:08.281]  Pretty good.
[02:14:08.721 --> 02:14:19.629]  I'm a first-time caller, and the reason I called in is because I heard this gentleman on the last hour who just never heard of the atomic soldiers, didn't believe a lot of the things you were saying.
[02:14:19.669 --> 02:14:26.935]  I mean, I don't know where he was coming from, that he doesn't read, possibly, or that he's just not informed.
[02:14:27.654 --> 02:14:29.395]  You should even think about what happened.
[02:14:29.515 --> 02:14:30.516]  I'm a Vietnam veteran.
[02:14:31.096 --> 02:14:32.657]  You know what happened to us with Agent Orange.
[02:14:33.358 --> 02:14:35.839]  Sure, and they said it was nutritious and good for you, and it's not.
[02:14:35.899 --> 02:14:37.640]  It basically melts your DNA.
[02:14:38.261 --> 02:14:38.601]  Pretty much.
[02:14:39.281 --> 02:14:43.904]  I've got prostate problems from it myself, and a friend of mine has gotten cancer also from it.
[02:14:44.745 --> 02:14:54.891]  You have these things happen, and I wish that the people were more educated about what's going on, and what our government is capable of, and how little they care about you or I.
[02:14:55.717 --> 02:15:13.107]  Well, supporting the troops for neocon followers is festooning your car with a plastic flag made in China by slaves, and walking around giddily while the country implodes around you, and getting mad at anybody that mentions DU being bad, or Asian Orange being bad, or... It's just basically worshipping government mindlessly.
[02:15:13.127 --> 02:15:22.452]  Yeah, and if you do question them, there's always the police authorities there, too, and you have to be careful of that, because, well, as you said, they can come into your house now, and they can do anything they pretty much want.
[02:15:22.492 --> 02:15:23.973]  They can search anything they want.
[02:15:24.902 --> 02:15:30.523]  My business involves me having scrutiny all the time by federal officials because I have an FFL.
[02:15:31.704 --> 02:15:34.464]  And let me tell you, they do scrutinize you very carefully.
[02:15:34.544 --> 02:15:38.785]  And a license is an authorization to do something that would be illegal.
[02:15:39.245 --> 02:15:41.145]  Fishing is illegal in the King's Lakes.
[02:15:41.526 --> 02:15:43.266]  Hunting is illegal in the King's Lakes.
[02:15:43.726 --> 02:15:46.287]  Owning rifles that are fully automatic is illegal.
[02:15:46.687 --> 02:15:50.808]  It's all illegal and now you're basically getting a license for a bolt action.
[02:15:50.848 --> 02:15:51.928]  That will soon be illegal.
[02:15:53.148 --> 02:15:59.274]  It's a very strange situation and it's like you're under a microscope and they're watching you and if you make the wrong move
[02:16:15.228 --> 02:16:15.829]  I guess that's why.
[02:16:15.849 --> 02:16:17.090]  But you don't want to watch them, though.
[02:16:17.230 --> 02:16:18.591]  You see, you're not allowed to watch government.
[02:16:18.871 --> 02:16:20.993]  That's bad and kooky and weird.
[02:16:21.353 --> 02:16:23.675]  Don't you know, trust the government, it's always perfect.
[02:16:23.955 --> 02:16:33.443]  Let them steal and let trillions come up missing and let them have gangsters running whole departments and let convicted felons run the voting machines and let their engineers go public and say it's a fraud.
[02:16:33.723 --> 02:16:35.705]  We'll just laugh at them and say it's good.
[02:16:35.725 --> 02:16:37.486]  Oh, everything's nice.
[02:16:37.766 --> 02:16:41.029]  That's why they'd love the guy from the last segment, because ignorance is bliss, isn't it?
[02:16:42.245 --> 02:16:44.886]  Well, it's bliss until you stumble off the edge of the cliff.
[02:16:44.926 --> 02:16:45.806]  I appreciate your call.
[02:16:46.086 --> 02:16:48.647]  Now, I'm going to try to... We took a couple of calls that segment, but it's not enough.
[02:16:48.747 --> 02:16:50.107]  I want to take a bunch of calls.
[02:16:50.627 --> 02:16:51.648]  I want to move quick.
[02:16:52.608 --> 02:16:53.908]  When we get back, I'm going to go to Ed.
[02:16:55.209 --> 02:17:00.570]  I'm going to go... I just want to add, I'm going to go to Joseph and others that are patiently holding the toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:17:00.630 --> 02:17:06.112]  And I'm going to go through my stack of news here and kind of blitz through it.
[02:17:06.132 --> 02:17:09.233]  But I've got this article, and this is accurate.
[02:17:09.273 --> 02:17:10.633]  And again, this is hidden in plain view.
[02:17:12.927 --> 02:17:13.988]  You think there's no fly list?
[02:17:14.028 --> 02:17:14.288]  No, no, no.
[02:17:14.308 --> 02:17:16.089]  There's no go over the border list.
[02:17:16.930 --> 02:17:19.571]  You see, it isn't going to be the Mexicans when you try to go into Mexico checking.
[02:17:19.591 --> 02:17:22.073]  You know, it's going to be... It's not going to be driving through anymore.
[02:17:22.113 --> 02:17:24.995]  It's going to be stopping and swiping your passport.
[02:17:25.755 --> 02:17:27.076]  But they don't have to do that coming in.
[02:17:27.096 --> 02:17:27.136]  Ha!

[02:17:40.748 --> 02:17:41.728]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:17:41.808 --> 02:17:46.591]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:17:46.751 --> 02:17:54.554]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:17:54.814 --> 02:18:00.177]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:18:00.397 --> 02:18:07.380]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:18:07.680 --> 02:18:13.003]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[02:18:13.263 --> 02:18:17.986]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[02:18:18.346 --> 02:18:25.950]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[02:18:26.290 --> 02:18:31.753]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[02:18:32.834 --> 02:18:34.496]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:35.778 --> 02:18:37.280]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:37.380 --> 02:18:43.067]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:18:43.647 --> 02:18:49.414]  Did you know that the mother of all secret societies, the Illuminati, worships Lucifer, better known as Satan the Devil?
[02:18:50.411 --> 02:18:57.136]  Did you know that they are the individuals giving rise to the final world social system described in Revelation Chapter 13?
[02:18:58.657 --> 02:19:03.361]  Did you know they were the founders of international communism to be the seen enemy of Christianity?
[02:19:03.881 --> 02:19:09.306]  To be used to destroy America so that we could be merged into an all-powerful one-world government?
[02:19:10.406 --> 02:19:18.533]  We would like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:19.393 --> 02:19:20.835]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:19:20.855 --> 02:19:22.397]  That's 1-800-516-8736 to request your subscription.
[02:19:22.417 --> 02:19:22.677]  Call now.
[02:19:22.697 --> 02:19:25.680]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[02:19:40.680 --> 02:19:45.904]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:19:46.044 --> 02:19:54.130]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:19:54.391 --> 02:20:01.436]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:20:02.377 --> 02:20:08.882]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:20:09.062 --> 02:20:14.166]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:20:14.266 --> 02:20:23.153]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[02:20:23.413 --> 02:20:26.715]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[02:20:29.017 --> 02:20:44.049]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[02:20:44.209 --> 02:20:45.070]  Look no further!
[02:20:45.390 --> 02:20:47.972]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[02:20:48.373 --> 02:20:56.880]  Hundreds of titles from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[02:20:57.060 --> 02:20:57.500]  You can order
[02:20:57.500 --> 02:20:58.000]  I think so.
[02:21:14.551 --> 02:21:14.891]  I don't know.
[02:21:55.492 --> 02:21:59.674]  Public hearings in Los Angeles and all over the country for that matter are being made secret.
[02:22:00.955 --> 02:22:04.157]  Mainstream trials are being made secret.
[02:22:04.317 --> 02:22:05.578]  Evidence is being made secret.
[02:22:05.598 --> 02:22:06.818]  Defense attorneys can't see it.
[02:22:07.238 --> 02:22:09.920]  Everything in the Patriot Act, everything in the Military Commissions Act.
[02:22:10.240 --> 02:22:13.662]  When Bush gets up and says, we've been doing this to fight crime for years, it's true.
[02:22:14.362 --> 02:22:17.544]  The whole Bill of Rights and Constitution is being burned.
[02:22:21.098 --> 02:22:26.102]  And they just brainwashed the police and the constabulary that, well, this is the new way we do things!
[02:22:26.702 --> 02:22:28.763]  FIGHT CRIME!
[02:22:29.304 --> 02:22:30.645]  Yeah, sure, you're fighting crime.
[02:22:32.006 --> 02:22:36.209]  I have this toll road, big glossy color booklet they sent out to everybody.
[02:22:36.969 --> 02:22:38.891]  I guess it's the Austin American Statesman here, locally.
[02:22:40.212 --> 02:22:49.058]  Going, get your free little tag, and then after the first of the year, you're gonna have to put money onto your new toll road system,
[02:22:49.881 --> 02:22:56.564]  But the roads are free for now, for the next two months, if you go and register and get your card now!
[02:22:57.344 --> 02:23:00.205]  And get your Texas Tag tracker chip now!
[02:23:01.245 --> 02:23:03.626]  It's wonderful, but if you don't, you'll have to pay.
[02:23:03.646 --> 02:23:06.087]  And they've slapped them on existing roads.
[02:23:06.407 --> 02:23:15.591]  Then they have Part 2 on the thing they mailed out, showing the roads that are in Phase 2, which is a bunch of other major roads in Austin.
[02:23:16.849 --> 02:23:22.050]  And the reason I laugh is all these yuppies and gigglers are gonna get their wish.
[02:23:23.531 --> 02:23:26.692]  It's just gonna get worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.
[02:23:28.772 --> 02:23:29.572]  I shouldn't laugh though.
[02:23:29.592 --> 02:23:31.113]  90 plus percent are against it.
[02:23:31.133 --> 02:23:31.953]  The government doesn't care.
[02:23:31.993 --> 02:23:43.196]  They just say, we got brainwashed people with tattoos all over them with giant arms on steroids who wear black masks and they'll come by and blow your head off!
[02:23:44.056 --> 02:23:45.937]  So you do what you're told, scum!
[02:23:47.409 --> 02:23:50.150]  And the good part about our thugs is they think they're the good guys!
[02:23:50.310 --> 02:23:51.410]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[02:23:52.090 --> 02:23:52.410]  Alright.
[02:23:54.591 --> 02:23:56.792]  Joseph in England, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:23:58.192 --> 02:23:58.792]  Evening, Alex.
[02:23:59.452 --> 02:24:12.396]  I just wanted to back you up on something that you were saying earlier, just so that your audience know that it's not just you saying it, regarding the whole thing about something that's going to happen within the next couple of months that you've basically been saying.
[02:24:13.597 --> 02:24:14.957]  I don't think it's actually an issue that
[02:24:15.492 --> 02:24:17.953]  You know, this is something that you said, you know, kind of thing.
[02:24:18.413 --> 02:24:22.335]  A lot of people are basically talking about this on the streets, you know, that something big is going to happen.
[02:24:22.375 --> 02:24:24.236]  Everything is lining up as it is now.
[02:24:24.716 --> 02:24:29.018]  And it's not just a case of, you know, if it doesn't happen by the end of October, Alex Jones is wrong.
[02:24:29.438 --> 02:24:30.579]  You know, it's a case of, you know,
[02:24:31.152 --> 02:24:36.855]  Strategically, now is the point, you know, to be vigilant and to be, you know, calling into talk shows and writing letters.
[02:24:36.875 --> 02:24:40.838]  Yeah, I mean, they built the Sunday, they put the whipped cream and nuts on it, now it's time for the cherry.
[02:24:40.858 --> 02:24:49.222]  I don't know when they're going to put the cherry on it, and I said if we didn't get the word out, they would pull something in late October, and we got the word out.
[02:24:50.483 --> 02:24:56.907]  Yeah, exactly, and I know that you're obviously the louder person, so people are just going to basically be looking to you if something doesn't happen.
[02:24:56.967 --> 02:24:58.848]  I personally think something still is going to happen.
[02:24:59.557 --> 02:25:02.999]  But, again, this isn't an issue of, you know, it's Alex Jones saying this.
[02:25:03.099 --> 02:25:06.422]  A lot of people are saying this at the moment, and they're not just saying it because you're saying it.
[02:25:06.462 --> 02:25:10.004]  They're saying it because of them looking at the facts, basically.
[02:25:11.425 --> 02:25:14.928]  You know, they're turning most of your major roads into toll roads in London now.
[02:25:15.408 --> 02:25:16.809]  Are folks excited about that?
[02:25:16.829 --> 02:25:18.410]  Well, yeah, yeah.
[02:25:18.430 --> 02:25:20.631]  I mean, I went down to London recently.
[02:25:20.671 --> 02:25:23.994]  We, you know, experienced a lot of that down there intensely.
[02:25:24.054 --> 02:25:28.637]  I mean, it's all... I live further up north, but it's all basically happening all over the country.
[02:25:29.477 --> 02:25:39.646]  The same thing there is happening here, and I had the former World Bank Chief on, Chief Economist, Nobel Prize winner, saying, this is our country being looted by the globalists.
[02:25:40.286 --> 02:25:45.971]  He said, they hand over the roads, his toll roads, to private interest for basically nothing.
[02:25:46.051 --> 02:25:50.915]  They gave Spain our roads, and now they're going in.
[02:25:50.995 --> 02:25:52.897]  New ones will be turning on every few months.
[02:25:54.873 --> 02:25:59.316]  It's all part of the Big Brother system, isn't it?
[02:25:59.356 --> 02:26:03.079]  I joke around and get mad about it, and I'm sardonic, but I'm really upset.
[02:26:03.680 --> 02:26:12.586]  To know you're a slave, to see the control systems going into place, and then to see the middle-class, middle-aged people out there watering their lawns.
[02:26:12.687 --> 02:26:15.309]  In the past, some of them would laugh at me.
[02:26:15.369 --> 02:26:16.610]  Now they look scared of me.
[02:26:17.070 --> 02:26:19.752]  Or I talk to them and they go, look, I know it's true, but I just don't want to discuss it.
[02:26:21.230 --> 02:26:22.250]  Well, you know what?
[02:26:23.091 --> 02:26:25.812]  I'd love to see them get up on their hind legs and fight back!
[02:26:26.752 --> 02:26:27.012]  Yeah.
[02:26:27.653 --> 02:26:30.914]  I mean, this is something that's really why it's important to wake people up.
[02:26:30.934 --> 02:26:33.775]  I mean, obviously, terrorism is, you know, a lot of falsified terrorism.
[02:26:34.175 --> 02:26:36.876]  Well, yeah, I mean, that's just the salve for all of it happening.
[02:26:37.529 --> 02:26:41.811]  You know, our police dress like Darth Vader and shake you down because of the terrorists!
[02:26:41.871 --> 02:26:46.554]  And we're grabbing all the money out of the Pentagon and the Treasury because of the terrorists!
[02:26:46.614 --> 02:26:49.815]  And we're putting cameras up in the schools because of the terrorists!
[02:26:49.855 --> 02:26:53.857]  And we're putting guns to children's heads and drills until they wet themselves!
[02:26:54.077 --> 02:26:56.879]  And we're going to euthanize the babies because of the terrorists!
[02:26:56.959 --> 02:27:00.581]  And we're making all the public meetings secret because of the terrorists!
[02:27:00.641 --> 02:27:03.202]  And we're doing it all because they're the terrorists!
[02:27:03.983 --> 02:27:04.443]  Anything else?
[02:27:05.365 --> 02:27:06.045]  No, you're not kidding.
[02:27:06.065 --> 02:27:12.567]  I mean, I've got a story that's up on one of my websites basically saying that Blair is basically saying we need ID cards to help fight terrorism.
[02:27:12.647 --> 02:27:14.067]  And how does that work, you know?
[02:27:14.087 --> 02:27:15.487]  It's problem, reaction, solution.
[02:27:15.708 --> 02:27:18.768]  But then he signs a deal to bring in unlimited illegal aliens.
[02:27:19.448 --> 02:27:20.249]  Good to hear from you.
[02:27:20.309 --> 02:27:21.009]  I appreciate it.
[02:27:21.049 --> 02:27:21.569]  Call back.
[02:27:21.609 --> 02:27:22.509]  More calls straight ahead.
[02:27:22.529 --> 02:27:22.569]  800-259-9231.
[02:27:22.589 --> 02:27:22.829]  Stay with me.
[02:27:22.849 --> 02:27:23.930]  We're on the march.
[02:27:23.950 --> 02:27:24.610]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:34.847 --> 02:27:37.629]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:42.612 --> 02:27:48.055]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[02:27:48.475 --> 02:27:53.218]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[02:27:53.598 --> 02:27:56.240]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:27:56.720 --> 02:28:00.062]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:28:00.896 --> 02:28:05.220]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:28:05.660 --> 02:28:08.823]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:28:09.443 --> 02:28:12.286]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:28:13.064 --> 02:28:15.206]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:28:15.246 --> 02:28:17.127]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[02:28:17.227 --> 02:28:17.307]  U.S.
[02:28:17.327 --> 02:28:19.448]  Debt Bubble Rent Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[02:28:19.468 --> 02:28:19.749]  Call 1-888-8XANADU.
[02:28:19.769 --> 02:28:20.649]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[02:28:20.669 --> 02:28:21.189]  Ask for George.
[02:28:40.697 --> 02:28:45.779]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:28:45.859 --> 02:28:53.142]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:28:53.302 --> 02:29:03.927]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:29:04.147 --> 02:29:08.689]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:29:08.969 --> 02:29:13.952]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[02:29:14.173 --> 02:29:17.115]  Yes, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:29:17.335 --> 02:29:27.201]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[02:29:27.221 --> 02:29:32.085]  Get a two-pack for only $99 or a four-pack for only $188 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:32.125 --> 02:29:34.126]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:29:38.770 --> 02:29:39.280]  We're good.

[02:30:05.545 --> 02:30:08.968]  In fact, the effectiveness of all the herbs featured on ResearchedHerbs.com

[02:30:57.368 --> 02:31:04.316]  There are police listening right now who have made the decision to serve this system come hell or high water.
[02:31:05.717 --> 02:31:06.278]  Go ahead.
[02:31:06.298 --> 02:31:09.381]  They claim 30 plus vaccines are mandatory now.
[02:31:09.421 --> 02:31:10.122]  There's no law.
[02:31:10.843 --> 02:31:13.426]  Now they're announcing it'll be 40 plus next year.
[02:31:14.086 --> 02:31:16.149]  Just go ahead and give your toddler the shots.
[02:31:16.910 --> 02:31:17.750]  Don't believe us.
[02:31:17.911 --> 02:31:18.972]  Worship your government.
[02:31:19.719 --> 02:31:20.880]  Just take a bite out of it.
[02:31:20.960 --> 02:31:21.560]  Trust them.
[02:31:21.980 --> 02:31:23.802]  You know I'm a liar, aren't I?
[02:31:23.842 --> 02:31:25.082]  I'm a liar, aren't I?
[02:31:25.322 --> 02:31:27.224]  Just go ahead and give your child the injections.
[02:31:27.664 --> 02:31:29.865]  I love your child more than you do, you scum.
[02:31:30.125 --> 02:31:31.706]  But go ahead and serve your God!
[02:31:31.906 --> 02:31:36.289]  And when your child's autistic, cop, remember I warned you, scum!
[02:31:39.691 --> 02:31:40.291]  I'm getting mad.
[02:31:40.311 --> 02:31:40.992]  I need to settle down.
[02:31:47.133 --> 02:31:48.153]  And you too, yuppies!
[02:31:48.394 --> 02:31:48.854]  All of ya!
[02:31:49.514 --> 02:31:50.054]  All of ya!
[02:31:51.035 --> 02:31:54.756]  Out there who serve this system, you're a bunch of weak-minded trash!
[02:31:58.478 --> 02:31:59.438]  You're like, what do you mean?
[02:31:59.478 --> 02:32:03.100]  I'm against open borders, I don't like toll roads either, but I gotta do my job!
[02:32:04.861 --> 02:32:07.642]  Again, I know most police out on the street are good people.
[02:32:08.502 --> 02:32:09.923]  Or at a deer camp are good people.
[02:32:10.791 --> 02:32:17.413]  But when you're ordered to go out in the streets with your big microwave cannons, and if you haven't gotten them yet, you'll be getting them soon, and fry us, you'll do it!
[02:32:19.253 --> 02:32:22.314]  You get in your mob psychology, and I'm talking about the yuppies, everybody.
[02:32:22.674 --> 02:32:39.439]  I single the police out a lot, because they just whine and complain, and it's inlet, and you know, how you're the system, and how we're the civilians, and you use that military terminology, and you don't know your head from a hole in the ground, and you work for a pack of criminals that could care less about you, or your family.
[02:32:41.104 --> 02:32:47.386]  And I have enough respect, and I don't have much, but I have more respect for you than your masters do.
[02:32:47.446 --> 02:32:49.326]  I'll tell you straight up what I think about you.
[02:32:52.347 --> 02:32:54.108]  I'll tell you point blank.
[02:32:54.988 --> 02:32:56.208]  You're in this with us.
[02:32:56.529 --> 02:33:00.290]  You're with us even if you choose sides and decide to serve the New World Order.
[02:33:00.710 --> 02:33:01.670]  That's what's sick about it.
[02:33:03.971 --> 02:33:05.091]  It just makes me sick.
[02:33:05.111 --> 02:33:08.312]  I've got stacks of articles here where whole states are getting rid of sheriffs.
[02:33:09.379 --> 02:33:11.601]  Whole states are making police chiefs permanent.
[02:33:12.262 --> 02:33:14.364]  Basically police unions just run whole cities.
[02:33:14.404 --> 02:33:18.127]  Pretty soon you'll run around in golden chariots and we'll just run around licking your boots.
[02:33:19.448 --> 02:33:21.009]  The whole system's going rogue.
[02:33:21.069 --> 02:33:26.174]  The whole system's going to... Criminals have taken over and they've got a bunch of Dudley New Rights working for them.
[02:33:29.673 --> 02:33:30.875]  And that goes for everybody else.
[02:33:31.055 --> 02:33:35.841]  The CPS workers, the people in the system, the corrupt lawyers, the prosecutors, all of you.
[02:33:36.321 --> 02:33:39.185]  The jail guards, the sadistic jail guards.
[02:33:41.347 --> 02:33:44.051]  You're throwing your whole country and your whole future away for nothing.
[02:33:45.232 --> 02:33:46.774]  You've been incrementally brainwashed.
[02:33:47.819 --> 02:33:48.939]  And I'm really mad at police.
[02:33:48.999 --> 02:33:53.481]  I mean, close to cusp, they're having drills, where armed police come in and put guns to children's heads.
[02:33:53.761 --> 02:33:57.843]  It'd be bad enough to announce the drill and do it, and traumatize them, but imagine unannounced.
[02:33:57.883 --> 02:34:00.064]  I mean, that is pure terrorism.
[02:34:01.304 --> 02:34:03.165]  That is causing great emotional harm.
[02:34:03.245 --> 02:34:04.265]  That is terrorism.
[02:34:05.986 --> 02:34:08.947]  Well, I know it's rough, but there are shooters that go into the schools.
[02:34:10.628 --> 02:34:13.969]  Getting in your car is thousands of times more dangerous than the schools.
[02:34:15.006 --> 02:34:18.248]  Going into the hospital and having surgeries thousands of times more dangerous.
[02:34:18.348 --> 02:34:20.549]  Swimming is hundreds of times more dangerous.
[02:34:20.630 --> 02:34:22.090]  I don't want to hear it to keep us safe.
[02:34:22.451 --> 02:34:24.692]  All these phantoms of terrorists and criminals.
[02:34:25.032 --> 02:34:27.294]  I'm not worried about terrorists if they were even real.
[02:34:27.574 --> 02:34:30.556]  I'm not worried about criminals if you wouldn't try to take my Second Amendment away.
[02:34:37.400 --> 02:34:40.001]  I could tell a whole story about buying a gun this weekend.
[02:34:40.021 --> 02:34:40.722]  Boy, that was fun.
[02:34:42.611 --> 02:34:45.713]  I can tell a whole story about what it's like to run into these game wardens.
[02:34:48.975 --> 02:34:49.595]  Just everywhere.
[02:34:49.655 --> 02:34:55.498]  I'll be out at National Park sometime and you know you drive through to buy your ticket to go in and they're rude to you and tell you the rules.
[02:34:55.719 --> 02:34:56.559]  Everything's changed.
[02:34:56.579 --> 02:34:58.920]  It's a bunch of swaggering thugs!
[02:35:00.721 --> 02:35:04.223]  You'd have fit in real nice in Soviet Russia or maybe China today.
[02:35:04.243 --> 02:35:10.267]  Now I'm going to go to Scott and Drew and Tom and others here in a moment.
[02:35:11.264 --> 02:35:14.827]  There is the big election and we'll tell you about all the fraud as it develops and as it unfolds.
[02:35:15.247 --> 02:35:16.788]  We've got a bunch of big guests the next two days.
[02:35:16.828 --> 02:35:17.689]  We're tracking all this.
[02:35:18.209 --> 02:35:19.430]  Mike Rivera is joining us.
[02:35:19.470 --> 02:35:22.532]  Bev Harris with the big HBO special is joining us tomorrow.
[02:35:22.592 --> 02:35:23.333]  Brad Blogg.
[02:35:23.353 --> 02:35:24.754]  I want to try to get Kurt Niemel on.
[02:35:26.375 --> 02:35:26.895]  Listen to this.
[02:35:26.955 --> 02:35:29.657]  Now you need permission to exit or enter the country.
[02:35:31.558 --> 02:35:35.621]  This is a letter to the dear readers of the Sovereign Society Offshore Newsletter.
[02:35:36.001 --> 02:35:36.802]  And I knew about this.
[02:35:36.822 --> 02:35:38.043]  This is very accurate.
[02:35:39.022 --> 02:35:50.092]  Because I don't know about the source, I just saw the article and it reminded me of what I learned about two years ago with passport changes due to take effect January 1st, that's in less than two months.
[02:35:52.053 --> 02:35:59.660]  Dear A-letter reader, forget no fly list, if Uncle Sam gets its way beginning on January 14th, 2007, my info is January 1st,
[02:36:02.825 --> 02:36:07.668]  We'll all be on no-fly list unless the government gives us permission to leave or re-enter the United States.
[02:36:08.148 --> 02:36:08.388]  The U.S.
[02:36:08.408 --> 02:36:23.857]  Department of Homeland Security, HSA, has proposed that all airlines, cruise lines, even fishing boats be required to obtain clearance for each passage they propose taking into or out of the United States.
[02:36:23.877 --> 02:36:29.920]  The reason I even know this is true, not just reading the stuff a year ago, two years ago, I've got some family that's going out of the country on a cruise
[02:36:31.775 --> 02:36:34.698]  In a few months, and they told me about this exact same thing.
[02:36:36.059 --> 02:36:38.080]  Quote, it doesn't matter if you have a U.S.
[02:36:38.120 --> 02:36:47.849]  passport, a travel document, that now, absent a court order to the contrary, gives you virtually unqualified right to enter or leave the United States anytime you want.
[02:36:48.409 --> 02:36:51.492]  When the DHS system comes into effect next January,
[02:36:52.791 --> 02:36:59.274]  If the agency says no to the clearance request, or doesn't answer the request at all, you won't be permitted to re-enter or leave the United States.
[02:36:59.515 --> 02:37:02.996]  And think about all the people that go try to buy guns, no criminal record, but they're not allowed to.
[02:37:04.737 --> 02:37:07.959]  Think about all the people, and this is already, it's just so sick, it's like no fly list.
[02:37:08.359 --> 02:37:09.920]  How many congressmen and women are on it?
[02:37:11.141 --> 02:37:13.762]  I've got some family, because they've got a common name who's on it.
[02:37:14.770 --> 02:37:17.471]  Consider what might happen if you're a U.S.
[02:37:17.511 --> 02:37:20.673]  passport holder on assignment in a country like Saudi Arabia.
[02:37:20.713 --> 02:37:24.234]  Your visa is about to expire, so you board your flight back to the United States, but wait!
[02:37:24.534 --> 02:37:27.556]  You can't get on because you don't have the permission from the HSA.
[02:37:27.876 --> 02:37:40.041]  Saudi immigration officials are on hand to escort you to a squalid detention center where you and others, who are now effectively stateless persons, are detained, potentially indefinitely, until the immigration status is sorted out.
[02:37:42.342 --> 02:37:43.283]  Well, think about this.
[02:37:44.480 --> 02:37:46.181]  You're not a good little globalist in the future.
[02:37:46.201 --> 02:37:48.523]  You won't be able to leave the country with your family.
[02:37:48.543 --> 02:37:55.609]  You'll have to do the reverse and go down to the Texas border and pay somebody $10 to take you across the Rio Grande in a rowboat.
[02:37:56.810 --> 02:37:57.990]  Which, by the way, we've done.
[02:37:58.010 --> 02:37:59.732]  When I was a little kid, we were down at Big Ben.
[02:38:00.592 --> 02:38:03.555]  And my parents, it was common back then.
[02:38:03.575 --> 02:38:05.196]  It wasn't illegal.
[02:38:06.457 --> 02:38:09.579]  They'd take us in rowboats across into Boquillas.
[02:38:10.980 --> 02:38:14.163]  And let me tell you, Boquillas, that's the most beautiful place I've ever seen.
[02:38:15.382 --> 02:38:17.343]  That part of Big Bend going across into Boquillas.
[02:38:17.703 --> 02:38:24.666]  Big caves coming out of the side of cliffs next to shores of the Rio Grande with these big green and red rocks all in the water.
[02:38:25.246 --> 02:38:27.027]  That was one of the most magic trips I was ever on.
[02:38:27.047 --> 02:38:28.508]  I was probably about six years old.
[02:38:28.528 --> 02:38:30.329]  Got photos of it.
[02:38:30.869 --> 02:38:35.511]  And then they took us across on little rowboats and we got on donkeys and rode into Boquillas.
[02:38:36.732 --> 02:38:40.173]  And in Boquillas there were dirt floored saloons and restaurants.
[02:38:41.014 --> 02:38:44.115]  I mean this was, you want to go shoot a movie, that's where Clint Eastwood should have gone.
[02:38:44.801 --> 02:38:46.181]  Of course, those places are gone now.
[02:38:46.221 --> 02:38:55.583]  They're drug-infested drug courier points and there's machine gun fights daily and dead, rotting illegal aliens all over the place because the coyotes shoot them and rob them.
[02:38:57.103 --> 02:38:59.764]  The state police and others don't even dare get near the border.
[02:38:59.784 --> 02:39:01.684]  They're routinely shot at, routinely killed.
[02:39:01.704 --> 02:39:05.485]  Alright, I'm already burning time up here.
[02:39:05.525 --> 02:39:06.845]  I just wanted to get into that article.
[02:39:10.105 --> 02:39:13.266]  And then there's stuff like this out of the Times
[02:39:14.740 --> 02:39:15.040]  Union.
[02:39:15.060 --> 02:39:18.283]  A narrow ruling cuts a broad legal swath.
[02:39:18.363 --> 02:39:24.748]  Agencies are barring the public from hearings, have the state high court's decision in a deputy misconduct case.
[02:39:24.808 --> 02:39:27.050]  Now public court hearings are barred to the public.
[02:39:29.472 --> 02:39:34.496]  And it goes on to talk about the California Supreme Court which restricted access to documents, even public hearings.
[02:39:36.337 --> 02:39:38.639]  Here's Wired Magazine saying, tagging phones
[02:39:39.804 --> 02:39:40.664]  to track traffic.
[02:39:41.064 --> 02:39:42.725]  I have another AP article today.
[02:39:43.005 --> 02:39:48.166]  Suddenly, when you know it's a government op, there'll be, you know, a hundred articles in a week telling you how great something is.
[02:39:49.987 --> 02:39:54.548]  And Austin's going to put in red light cameras now, which have been ruled to be illegal all over the country.
[02:39:54.588 --> 02:39:55.729]  That even cuts out the cops.
[02:39:55.769 --> 02:39:57.269]  Private defense contractors run them.
[02:40:00.409 --> 02:40:03.371]  They're already using the cell phones and announcing it to track everywhere you go.
[02:40:03.391 --> 02:40:04.492]  They claim to track traffic.
[02:40:04.812 --> 02:40:05.693]  Tax Dots are doing it.
[02:40:05.713 --> 02:40:09.736]  They're doing it in Kansas, doing it in Missouri, doing it in Ohio, doing it in Montana.
[02:40:11.657 --> 02:40:12.778]  We always told you they would.
[02:40:12.818 --> 02:40:13.799]  Here they are announcing it.
[02:40:15.480 --> 02:40:16.440]  And then I've got this.
[02:40:18.522 --> 02:40:21.384]  By the way, Republicans and Democrats almost universally are all for this.
[02:40:21.744 --> 02:40:24.266]  The people universally are against it, but they don't care.
[02:40:26.087 --> 02:40:28.509]  They're bought off by the same multinational corporations.
[02:40:30.484 --> 02:40:31.304]  Well, here it is.
[02:40:31.484 --> 02:40:32.365]  Existing roads.
[02:40:32.565 --> 02:40:39.947]  They announced that 14 major roads surrounding Austin at key choke points where you literally won't be able to travel anywhere without using the toll roads.
[02:40:41.607 --> 02:40:48.809]  They were, in the beginning of 2007, to open 9 of the 14 roads because of protests, lawsuits, absolute bedlam.
[02:40:49.950 --> 02:40:52.330]  They're starting with only 2 major roads.
[02:40:53.271 --> 02:40:54.171]  They've already opened.
[02:40:55.254 --> 02:40:58.235]  They're free, quote, until the first of the year, but here's the deal.
[02:40:58.255 --> 02:41:06.137]  You've got to go get the tracker chip tag, and you've got to go ahead and put money on the account for when it starts in January.
[02:41:10.059 --> 02:41:10.459]  Okay?
[02:41:11.279 --> 02:41:12.619]  And this is how they phase it in.
[02:41:12.659 --> 02:41:13.820]  This is called domestication.
[02:41:13.860 --> 02:41:14.300]  Listen to it.
[02:41:14.960 --> 02:41:16.821]  Roads are free until January 6th.
[02:41:16.881 --> 02:41:18.381]  November 1st, January 5th, free.
[02:41:18.821 --> 02:41:22.242]  January 6th, January 31st, free with Texas tag.
[02:41:22.582 --> 02:41:24.783]  February, half price tolls with K tag.
[02:41:25.549 --> 02:41:26.170]  Texas TAG.
[02:41:27.090 --> 02:41:28.371]  It's called KTAG in Kansas.
[02:41:28.432 --> 02:41:32.115]  I just put that in my first film in 97, so I slipped up and said KTAG.
[02:41:33.216 --> 02:41:37.720]  March and beyond, 10% discount with Texas TAG, and then after that, no discount.
[02:41:39.741 --> 02:41:44.185]  So in Illinois, they double the tolls if you're paying with cash, so you gotta get the TAG.
[02:41:45.746 --> 02:41:48.589]  The Central Texas Turnpike Project is now open for business!
[02:41:49.406 --> 02:41:51.527]  And it's owned by the Spanish, I don't tell you that.
[02:41:51.887 --> 02:41:53.868]  Three brand new... I'm sorry, I said two.
[02:41:53.888 --> 02:41:57.590]  The way I look at this is it looks like... Well, it's two existing roads and then one new one.
[02:41:57.770 --> 02:42:00.231]  That's why I was looking at the map and said two.
[02:42:00.411 --> 02:42:01.611]  I'm sorry, it's worse than I said.
[02:42:01.651 --> 02:42:02.292]  It's three.
[02:42:02.352 --> 02:42:03.712]  But two are existing roads.
[02:42:05.153 --> 02:42:10.615]  Three brand new Texas-area toll roads will bring welcome relief from traffic congestion.
[02:42:10.635 --> 02:42:12.076]  Oh yeah, on existing roads.
[02:42:12.476 --> 02:42:13.797]  And gridlock in North Austin.
[02:42:14.237 --> 02:42:15.297]  Round Rock and Pflugerville.
[02:42:15.718 --> 02:42:17.919]  The first 27 miles of high-tech roadways.
[02:42:17.979 --> 02:42:18.759]  Oh, they're high-tech!
[02:42:19.386 --> 02:42:21.648]  All built from start to finish in less than four years.
[02:42:22.269 --> 02:42:24.732]  What, because they built a few connections into existing roads?
[02:42:25.272 --> 02:42:27.875]  Offer drivers much-needed options to get where they want to go.
[02:42:28.435 --> 02:42:29.576]  Come try them out for free.
[02:42:30.497 --> 02:42:33.640]  And trade those long waits at traffic lights for a faster home ride.
[02:42:36.423 --> 02:42:40.027]  Yeah, if you hit these areas in North Austin during traffic, you'll be in traffic twenty minutes.
[02:42:42.210 --> 02:42:44.873]  But now it's going to be even worse because they're grabbing existing roads.
[02:42:45.394 --> 02:42:52.882]  Come try them out for free and trade those long waits at traffic lights for a faster ride home to work or wherever your travels take you.
[02:42:52.902 --> 02:43:00.110]  And it's got some idiot woman on the front smiling like she just won the lottery with this huge fake smile.
[02:43:00.836 --> 02:43:01.857]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:43:02.637 --> 02:43:03.858]  Smiling as she drives.
[02:43:03.958 --> 02:43:04.879]  Oh, I'm so happy!
[02:43:04.899 --> 02:43:18.749]  It's like these drug commercials, where it's all gloomy and doomy, and then they take the drug, and then everything's flowers, and hopping, and jumping, and... Pay the tolls the fast and easy way with the electronic tax tag.
[02:43:18.929 --> 02:43:22.652]  Oh, which they tried to make law on all inspection stickers, but we defeated.
[02:43:22.932 --> 02:43:24.373]  But don't worry, they're racing ahead with that.
[02:43:24.413 --> 02:43:24.874]  They don't care.
[02:43:26.395 --> 02:43:29.898]  See for yourself how much time you can save on the new toll roads.
[02:43:29.958 --> 02:43:30.358]  Try them!
[02:43:32.620 --> 02:43:34.561]  And it says, Loop One North, $0.75.
[02:43:34.622 --> 02:43:37.904]  SH-130 Toll Plaza, $1.50.
[02:43:38.765 --> 02:43:39.385]  And the ramps, $0.50.
[02:43:44.028 --> 02:43:46.910]  Tolls are based on how far you drive and what kind of vehicle you're driving.
[02:43:47.151 --> 02:43:57.158]  Oh yeah, gets you into that whole system, which gets you ready for the new Kyoto Accords, which is just a global tax, nothing to do with global warming, whether you believe in it or not, but a solution to fraud.
[02:43:57.774 --> 02:43:58.934]  Cut your driving time!
[02:43:59.014 --> 02:43:59.875]  It just goes on.
[02:44:00.355 --> 02:44:01.335]  It's Texas Tag.
[02:44:01.355 --> 02:44:03.896]  Why don't you call it Spain Slave Tag.
[02:44:08.257 --> 02:44:17.940]  It says during the introductory period there is no charge for your electronic text tag sticker, but you'll need to activate it by shutting up and depositing money in your text tag account.
[02:44:17.960 --> 02:44:20.961]  So you gotta pay for it for the time to come.
[02:44:23.473 --> 02:44:27.796]  Get some free goods if you sign up with us and sign over your everything to us.
[02:44:28.497 --> 02:44:36.763]  Go to TXTag.org and follow the simple instructions to order your TXTag and create an account or call 888-GO-TXTag.
[02:44:36.803 --> 02:44:42.727]  That's 888-468-9824 to speak with a customer service representative.
[02:44:43.908 --> 02:44:45.129]  Texas Tollways.
[02:44:46.050 --> 02:44:47.571]  Texas Department of Transportation.
[02:44:47.591 --> 02:44:47.751]  Yay!
[02:44:50.041 --> 02:44:53.402]  And they show the existing two roads that it's going to be on.
[02:44:56.482 --> 02:44:59.403]  They are grabbing Mopac.
[02:45:01.903 --> 02:45:04.804]  Used to, you could go up Mopac and run right into Round Rock.
[02:45:04.864 --> 02:45:06.004]  Now that's a toll road.
[02:45:07.064 --> 02:45:12.606]  And if you want to try to cut around Cedar Park on 45, there's going to be a toll road.
[02:45:12.706 --> 02:45:15.586]  And then 183 is going to have a toll road.
[02:45:15.806 --> 02:45:19.467]  But again, it's two existing roads, one new road, which is an extension.
[02:45:20.916 --> 02:45:24.537]  And then they show them in green that start in the middle of 2007.
[02:45:24.877 --> 02:45:30.118]  That's the 1A3A toll road and the Cedar Park 45 toll road.
[02:45:30.438 --> 02:45:30.898]  So there's really 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[02:45:34.118 --> 02:45:38.759]  They say 3, there's really 6 on their map, but they're being honest because 3 of them open now.
[02:45:40.659 --> 02:45:41.700]  Existing roads open now.
[02:45:42.580 --> 02:45:49.601]  And the only one that is really new is one extension of the 130 out around town.
[02:45:54.051 --> 02:45:55.332]  I'm pretty mad right now, folks.
[02:45:55.912 --> 02:45:58.113]  Let's go ahead and talk to Scott in New Jersey.
[02:45:58.153 --> 02:45:58.973]  Scott, thanks for holding.
[02:45:59.434 --> 02:46:01.435]  Mr. Jones, thank you for taking my call.
[02:46:01.455 --> 02:46:03.055]  Thank you for everything that you do, by the way.
[02:46:03.195 --> 02:46:04.356]  Thank you.
[02:46:04.516 --> 02:46:10.699]  I wish I had a comment about your Texas roads, because I'm not in Texas, but I do know... Well, it's happening everywhere.
[02:46:10.719 --> 02:46:12.880]  This is to pay for the North American Union.
[02:46:12.900 --> 02:46:14.661]  All right, it's an easy pass.
[02:46:14.681 --> 02:46:16.982]  Basically, what they'll do is, when you sign up, you get the card.
[02:46:17.486 --> 02:46:20.148]  Another way to keep track of all the users to soft crimes.
[02:46:20.649 --> 02:46:22.490]  Oh yeah, that was in the news all over the country.
[02:46:22.530 --> 02:46:27.074]  They also track these tags with readers that's not put up on other roads that aren't toll roads, yes.
[02:46:27.554 --> 02:46:28.175]  Yes, exactly.
[02:46:29.096 --> 02:46:30.817]  I just had a couple of comments real quick.
[02:46:30.837 --> 02:46:43.868]  The TexasBorderWatch.org site, I don't know if you really touched on that too much recently, basically you can go on there if you see something going on at the border, you click the button to report somebody coming across and I guess they'll
[02:46:44.369 --> 02:46:45.630]  Dispatch police down there.
[02:46:45.731 --> 02:46:47.292]  And absolutely nothing is done.
[02:46:47.312 --> 02:46:52.157]  It's trained us to be tattletales instead of having the police and the military do it.
[02:46:53.699 --> 02:46:55.021]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:46:55.401 --> 02:47:06.433]  Another thing too, I wanted to know, is there someplace I can go to see where the funds from the World Trade Center steals, as far as how much and how that money was distributed, where it went,
[02:47:07.483 --> 02:47:15.548]  No, that's all been made secret, but documents came out three weeks ago showing that nothing now out of the funds of the police and firemen has been given.
[02:47:15.988 --> 02:47:23.712]  It's all been kept to the lawyers, who've sucked most of it, and their own documents where they suppress the asbestos and the mercury and the concrete that they breathe.
[02:47:23.732 --> 02:47:27.174]  I mean, there's a bunch of reports on that, so there's pieces of it.
[02:47:27.214 --> 02:47:29.055]  But again, that's secret information.
[02:47:29.075 --> 02:47:31.557]  Al Qaeda might get us if we help the police.
[02:47:33.006 --> 02:47:36.809]  The one lady that makes $300,000 a year to fight the family in the world.
[02:47:37.169 --> 02:47:37.690]  That's right.
[02:47:37.750 --> 02:47:41.172]  Yeah, she's the head of the city insurance group.
[02:47:41.712 --> 02:47:45.735]  There was a rally last week that really didn't touch on the news to much.
[02:47:45.775 --> 02:47:57.063]  Maybe hearing there was a couple blurbs as far as the family's trying to get the army organization in for the... because they're still finding remains over there.
[02:47:57.103 --> 02:47:59.965]  Bloomberg said, we're not stopping anything and everything's going on.
[02:48:01.559 --> 02:48:03.680]  Yeah, they don't really care about dead firemen and police.
[02:48:04.361 --> 02:48:06.962]  Again, they just pat them on the head and go, good slave, good, good.
[02:48:06.982 --> 02:48:11.205]  It's like a hunting dog you don't really care about.
[02:48:11.225 --> 02:48:12.425]  Oh, old yellers.
[02:48:13.066 --> 02:48:16.548]  Oh, I'm going to go ahead and send him in there with a couple of wild hogs.
[02:48:16.588 --> 02:48:17.908]  Let him go ahead and get killed.
[02:48:18.329 --> 02:48:19.770]  I don't like that dog no more.
[02:48:20.010 --> 02:48:21.551]  The dog will still start to lick his hand.
[02:48:21.571 --> 02:48:22.931]  Oh, I love you, master.
[02:48:23.031 --> 02:48:23.712]  Oh, I love you.
[02:48:24.913 --> 02:48:26.473]  I appreciate it.
[02:48:26.694 --> 02:48:27.014]  Thank you.
[02:48:27.354 --> 02:48:29.455]  Drew and Tom, last callers, final segment.
[02:48:30.096 --> 02:48:30.676]  Straight ahead.
[02:48:31.650 --> 02:48:32.671]  Big election tomorrow.
[02:48:33.412 --> 02:48:35.393]  Poopie, let's vote for the Republicans.
[02:48:35.413 --> 02:48:37.975]  They gave Saddam the death penalty.
[02:48:38.256 --> 02:48:39.577]  They're getting tough.
[02:48:41.018 --> 02:48:44.561]  It's here.
[02:48:44.681 --> 02:48:49.445]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:49.846 --> 02:48:57.412]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:48:58.160 --> 02:49:05.224]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:05.624 --> 02:49:17.031]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:17.351 --> 02:49:20.873]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:21.333 --> 02:49:23.234]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:23.575 --> 02:49:27.357]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:03.488 --> 02:50:12.854]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Verkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:50:13.114 --> 02:50:16.616]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:50:16.856 --> 02:50:23.961]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[02:51:16.476 --> 02:51:16.816]  I think so.
[02:51:43.439 --> 02:51:49.481]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:51:50.081 --> 02:51:53.082]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:55.823 --> 02:51:57.344]  These toll roads are criminal.
[02:51:57.484 --> 02:52:06.507]  They plan to put them everywhere where you don't have a choice, where you must use them, you must bankrupt them, you must not use them, when they start opening them, religiously.
[02:52:07.327 --> 02:52:09.888]  You must not use the toll roads anywhere in the country.
[02:52:10.188 --> 02:52:11.549]  I know a lot of places it's too late.
[02:52:11.569 --> 02:52:12.590]  They're already all in place.
[02:52:12.910 --> 02:52:15.791]  Before I go to two final calls tomorrow, big election coverage.
[02:52:16.231 --> 02:52:18.312]  Bev Harris joins us and Michael Rivero.
[02:52:19.553 --> 02:52:20.473]  You don't want to miss that.
[02:52:20.513 --> 02:52:24.495]  We'll tell you about all the things that are going on and what's developing and who it looks like is winning.
[02:52:25.116 --> 02:52:30.778]  Then of course the next day on Wednesday we'll also give you coverage on that and what other October surprises are pulled.
[02:52:32.099 --> 02:52:36.481]  My new film Terror Storm has gone into the top ten on the Amazon charts.
[02:52:37.088 --> 02:52:37.528]  We're good to go.
[02:52:54.043 --> 02:52:55.784]  I'm in Tucson, Arizona.
[02:53:20.778 --> 02:53:27.841]  My comment to the toll roads is that we didn't have a lot down here and they finally said, well, we're going to build a toll road that's a shortcut from I-10 to I-8.
[02:53:28.482 --> 02:53:29.862]  It'll make it easier for the truckers.
[02:53:29.882 --> 02:53:31.643]  It'll make it easier for the folks in that area.
[02:53:32.124 --> 02:53:33.324]  And it's going to be a toll road.
[02:53:33.344 --> 02:53:34.365]  And this is their wedge point.
[02:53:34.405 --> 02:53:35.525]  This is their starting point.
[02:53:35.665 --> 02:53:38.306]  And so the state of Arizona, look out, here they come.
[02:53:38.326 --> 02:53:39.407]  They're going to tax us too.
[02:53:39.927 --> 02:53:43.489]  I just wanted to point out to your listeners, Alex, that the 9-11 Truth Movement is on the move.
[02:53:44.025 --> 02:53:45.766]  There are many events coming up this week.
[02:53:45.806 --> 02:53:47.628]  In fact, many showings this weekend.
[02:53:47.988 --> 02:53:53.192]  I see the 9-11 Truth Austin's putting a free showing of Terror Storm together in Arlington, Virginia.
[02:53:53.512 --> 02:54:00.438]  There's a big symposium with Kevin Barnett, Wayne Madison, Griffin Tarpley in Berkeley, California on Saturday.
[02:54:00.458 --> 02:54:03.420]  There's a big event that's with Stephen Jones and others.
[02:54:03.940 --> 02:54:06.963]  And then, I'm sorry, Stephen Jones will be in
[02:54:09.143 --> 02:54:10.324]  Sorry, Berkeley, California.
[02:54:10.344 --> 02:54:11.946]  Folks can just do searches for 9-11.
[02:54:11.966 --> 02:54:15.669]  9-11 blogger, the calendar page on 9-11 blogger.
[02:54:16.029 --> 02:54:16.650]  They're all over.
[02:54:16.670 --> 02:54:18.051]  They're having screenings in libraries.
[02:54:18.091 --> 02:54:18.992]  It's getting excited out.
[02:54:19.012 --> 02:54:19.853]  We're getting the word out.
[02:54:20.313 --> 02:54:20.934]  We need people.
[02:54:21.014 --> 02:54:22.095]  If there's not an event near you,
[02:54:22.748 --> 02:54:23.649]  Throw an event together.
[02:54:23.689 --> 02:54:24.429]  Call your local library.
[02:54:24.449 --> 02:54:28.651]  Yeah, we're putting on a free showing of Terror Storm at the Unitarian Church this Friday.
[02:54:28.711 --> 02:54:29.532]  I'm going to be there.
[02:54:29.912 --> 02:54:33.093]  We need the other locals to promote this, and I appreciate your call.
[02:54:33.113 --> 02:54:34.714]  We need to promote all those events.
[02:54:34.754 --> 02:54:36.295]  Good job, and I appreciate the call, Drew.
[02:54:36.615 --> 02:54:37.476]  Sorry to cut you short.
[02:54:37.516 --> 02:54:39.097]  I'm hurrying here because the show's almost over.
[02:54:39.637 --> 02:54:40.677]  Tom in California.
[02:54:40.697 --> 02:54:41.258]  You're on the air.
[02:54:41.298 --> 02:54:41.698]  Go ahead.
[02:54:42.839 --> 02:54:43.239]  Hi, Alex.
[02:54:43.559 --> 02:54:43.859]  Hi.
[02:54:44.099 --> 02:54:44.619]  Two questions.
[02:54:45.340 --> 02:54:51.203]  In Nazi Germany, after the invasion of Czechoslovakia and after the Reichstag fire and the invasion of Poland,
[02:54:51.687 --> 02:54:55.508]  Were Germans polarized like Americans were and are after 9-11?
[02:54:55.748 --> 02:55:01.990]  And number two, was there someone like you or a group of people who created a resistance?
[02:55:02.030 --> 02:55:10.013]  Germans were very intelligent, the most advanced country in Europe, but they were also very subservient to power and orders and direction.
[02:55:10.453 --> 02:55:12.954]  There was resistance, but not as big as it is here.
[02:55:14.003 --> 02:55:18.584]  And Hitler also had thugs that would go beat you up or kill you by 36 and 37.
[02:55:19.064 --> 02:55:21.945]  And the people would have fought violently back then.
[02:55:22.525 --> 02:55:24.546]  But the problem is he could always say you were a communist.
[02:55:24.606 --> 02:55:28.707]  Most people fighting him weren't communists, but he could say, OK, do you want the commies to get you?
[02:55:28.747 --> 02:55:30.347]  Kind of like, hey, do you want Al-Qaeda to get you?
[02:55:31.627 --> 02:55:34.928]  OK, and then of course, later he made a deal with Stalin and then later turned on Stalin.
[02:55:35.388 --> 02:55:35.988]  I appreciate it.
[02:55:36.008 --> 02:55:36.709]  What was the other question?
[02:55:37.389 --> 02:55:37.949]  Oh, that was it.
[02:55:37.989 --> 02:55:38.809]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:55:38.869 --> 02:55:39.269]  Thank you.
[02:55:39.349 --> 02:55:40.149]  I'm out of time.
[02:55:41.030 --> 02:55:42.650]  I heard somebody this morning at a talk show was going,
[02:55:43.453 --> 02:55:45.595]  Hitler, I hear the liberals compare Bush to Hitler.
[02:55:45.655 --> 02:55:46.836]  Hitler was a socialist.
[02:55:47.576 --> 02:55:54.002]  He took over the German Workers' Party, the National Socialist Workers' Party, the Nazis.
[02:55:54.042 --> 02:56:01.968]  It was not socialist, it was fascist, where they took the people's wealth and basically funneled it into corporations.
[02:56:02.028 --> 02:56:04.891]  So, it is accurate to call the neocons Nazis.
[02:56:05.231 --> 02:56:08.674]  In fact, they were Nazi agents, their progenitors were, many of them.
[02:56:09.318 --> 02:56:09.658]  All right.
[02:56:09.759 --> 02:56:10.960]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:11.060 --> 02:56:12.141]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:12.201 --> 02:56:15.784]  Thanks to all the affiliates, the listeners, the sponsors, the great folks running the broadcast.
[02:56:15.804 --> 02:56:16.525]  God bless you all.
[02:56:16.785 --> 02:56:18.367]  Send Terror Storm to number one!
[02:56:18.427 --> 02:56:18.887]  Help us!
