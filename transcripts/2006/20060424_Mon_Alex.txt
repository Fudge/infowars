[00:00:05.931 --> 00:00:06.592]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.252 --> 00:00:08.313]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.014 --> 00:00:10.115]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.775 --> 00:00:11.596]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.357 --> 00:00:14.259]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:17.582]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.102 --> 00:00:22.246]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.714 --> 00:00:31.815]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:35.177 --> 00:00:43.503]  Massive broadcast lined up for you today on this live 24th day of April 2006 Monday edition.
[00:00:45.324 --> 00:00:59.313]  Coming up in the next hour via his fixed-wing aircraft, we will have Glenn Spencer of American Border Patrol down there in Cochise County, Arizona, flying over the border.
[00:00:59.353 --> 00:01:00.594]  Now, he's got to stay at about 1,000 feet.
[00:01:01.832 --> 00:01:02.772]  We're good to go.
[00:01:02.792 --> 00:01:03.412]  We're good to go.
[00:01:28.408 --> 00:01:38.591]  Glenn Spencer will be joining us, kind of like Skywatch traffic, I guess, but watching the illegal alien traffic pouring across just one point on the border.
[00:01:38.611 --> 00:01:40.411]  He'll just be on several zones.
[00:01:40.431 --> 00:01:49.094]  He'll be sending back live video feed to his servers via a link, and we'll be streaming that on Infowars.com.
[00:01:49.974 --> 00:01:53.955]  So this should be interesting coming up in the second hour.
[00:01:55.914 --> 00:01:56.615]  We're good to go.
[00:01:56.635 --> 00:01:57.115]  I think?
[00:02:14.696 --> 00:02:15.317]  We're good to go.
[00:02:15.337 --> 00:02:15.577]  I think?
[00:02:35.542 --> 00:02:57.087]  And since he brought forward that hypothesis, people have been studying the video, and there is video that we have up on prisonplanet.com that clearly shows thermite, it's on infowars.com as well, thermite, what looks like thermite, in fact we have side-by-side video of thermite-steel reactions, as the molten steel drips and oozes and burns.
[00:02:58.087 --> 00:03:03.668]  And it looks like thermite, really nothing else does this, but thermite, it is molten metal.
[00:03:04.808 --> 00:03:11.792]  Molten metal spilling and oozing and dripping as if a blowtorch is on the steel.
[00:03:13.072 --> 00:03:18.175]  And that takes more than 3,000 degrees to get steel molten.
[00:03:18.795 --> 00:03:21.617]  I mean, molten to the point of being white hot.
[00:03:22.597 --> 00:03:26.079]  So we'll go over an article that Paul Watson and myself put together.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.681]  And Paul did a great job doing most of the work on it.
[00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.703]  It's a big news story that we, again, first broke back in November.
[00:03:34.783 --> 00:03:40.868]  Others now have found more documentation to prove it, and it's extremely, I would say, very close to conclusive.
[00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:47.513]  So go to prisonplanet.com, download it, read it, look at the video clips, tell us what you think, and please email it out to everybody.
[00:03:47.533 --> 00:03:48.294]  It's very, very big.
[00:03:50.516 --> 00:03:53.838]  Also, CIA has fired an employee for alleged leak.
[00:03:54.118 --> 00:03:59.683]  Now, Bush is leaking to burn CIA agents, spy chiefs, just for political gain.
[00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:11.736]  And as a dirty trick, this woman valiantly leaked the fact that they have secret illegal torture death camps all over Asia, all over Central Asia, all over the Middle East, all over Europe.
[00:04:12.417 --> 00:04:13.819]  She reported on illegal behavior.
[00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:23.946]  It'd be like if she saw, say, the CIA director hypothetically murdering someone in his office, and then she leaked it, and then he doesn't get in trouble, but she does.
[00:04:24.006 --> 00:04:24.847]  She's been fired.
[00:04:24.867 --> 00:04:29.570]  They're talking about arresting her, indicting her, charging her with sedition.
[00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.413]  I heard neocons this weekend calling her a traitor.
[00:04:32.473 --> 00:04:33.513]  She needs to be arrested.
[00:04:34.634 --> 00:04:37.336]  You have a right, you have a duty to report illegal behavior.
[00:04:38.177 --> 00:04:42.000]  That goes for police, firemen, bureaucrats, private citizens.
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.441]  You know about a crime.
[00:04:44.244 --> 00:04:45.145]  And you don't report it.
[00:04:45.946 --> 00:04:47.628]  You're an accomplice after the fact.
[00:04:47.688 --> 00:04:50.852]  And if you know about it before it happens, you're an accomplice.
[00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:53.355]  There's a lot of other news.
[00:04:54.236 --> 00:04:55.017]  There's so much of it.
[00:04:55.057 --> 00:04:56.459]  It's all coming up after this break.
[00:04:56.799 --> 00:04:58.081]  New Bin Laden tape.
[00:04:58.121 --> 00:04:58.802]  We'll cover it all.
[00:05:01.784 --> 00:05:08.627]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:05:08.927 --> 00:05:10.307]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:05:10.487 --> 00:05:12.708]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:12.848 --> 00:05:14.949]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:20.151]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:20.491 --> 00:05:24.513]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:05:24.773 --> 00:05:26.554]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:05:26.634 --> 00:05:37.279]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plattable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.320]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[00:07:57.252 --> 00:08:07.377]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:32.232]  Glenn Spencer of American Border Patrol will be joining us in the next hour from the border to give us a literal traffic report from his airplane skimming the surface of the earth.
[00:08:32.312 --> 00:08:35.795]  He has to stay low because cell phones don't work above 1,500 feet.
[00:08:35.815 --> 00:08:36.956]  That's a scientific fact.
[00:08:38.458 --> 00:08:39.538]  Despite what they told you on 9-11.
[00:08:42.199 --> 00:08:54.446]  So he'll be joining us coming up in the next hour, sending back live video images to his website, AmericanPatrol.com, that we'll be picking up as well on InfoWars.com live.
[00:08:55.267 --> 00:09:01.371]  And he's done this on a few of the radio shows, and every time he does it, they pick up illegal aliens pouring across.
[00:09:01.731 --> 00:09:08.355]  There's only certain zones he can stay in, too, around the cell towers themselves within a few miles of each cell tower that's on the border.
[00:09:08.415 --> 00:09:09.696]  So this should be interesting, but...
[00:09:10.396 --> 00:09:13.157]  We'll see if it goes off without a hitch coming up in the next hour.
[00:09:13.177 --> 00:09:33.783]  I'm going to get into Bush leaking and what happens when Bush does it, and then compare that to what's happening to the CIA agent that has leaked the foreign illegal black site, as they call them, torture camps and execution camps, the rendition camps, where the people that go into the black bags end up.
[00:09:35.263 --> 00:09:36.143]  We'll cover that.
[00:09:36.163 --> 00:09:38.844]  There's more news on the economy, on gold, on oil.
[00:09:39.631 --> 00:09:41.433]  And we'll take your calls on those issues.
[00:09:42.734 --> 00:09:48.159]  Spencer's only going to be joining us for about 30 minutes today, so the balance of the broadcast will be phone calls and news.
[00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.522]  And I want to get into the latest bin Laden tape.
[00:09:52.463 --> 00:09:53.644]  There's a lot we're going to cover.
[00:09:54.905 --> 00:10:02.892]  But before I do that, I'm just going to get this out of the way now, and then I don't want to discuss it and I don't want to talk about it.
[00:10:03.413 --> 00:10:06.015]  Obviously, we don't screen your calls, and if you bring it up, so be it.
[00:10:08.283 --> 00:10:13.865]  Charlie Sheen was told several weeks ago to shut up about 9-11.
[00:10:14.525 --> 00:10:17.506]  And he asked me not to get into it, not to talk about it.
[00:10:18.086 --> 00:10:18.806]  Not to defend him.
[00:10:18.826 --> 00:10:23.188]  He has a history of really just being a gentleman and taking stuff.
[00:10:24.328 --> 00:10:27.389]  And he's been in a divorce for the last few months.
[00:10:28.649 --> 00:10:33.651]  And it's in Denise Richards, his soon-to-be ex-wife's own filings.
[00:10:35.109 --> 00:10:36.291]  That he's crazy.
[00:10:36.392 --> 00:10:40.519]  He believes that vaccines are bad for the kids and didn't want to give it to the children.
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:41.982]  He's delusional.
[00:10:42.631 --> 00:10:44.272]  Doesn't matter if it's on the nightly news.
[00:10:44.312 --> 00:10:45.512]  They have to take the mercury out.
[00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:49.133]  We've gone from 1 in 24,000 kids having autism to 1 in 168.
[00:10:50.694 --> 00:11:00.017]  We have CDC's own documents admitting back in 2000 they got declassified, got released by Congressman Dan Burton in 2003 where it's causing massive brain damage.
[00:11:00.237 --> 00:11:02.818]  So she lists that, just to give you an idea where she's coming from.
[00:11:03.278 --> 00:11:10.400]  Then she lists his 9-11 obsession and how he just constantly is researching it and talking about it and looking at it.
[00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:17.252]  And it was relayed to Sheen to shut up about 9-11.
[00:11:17.533 --> 00:11:20.274]  That's all I'm going to say, and I'm going too far there.
[00:11:21.174 --> 00:11:24.716]  It's just that he was told several weeks ago, shut up!
[00:11:26.217 --> 00:11:28.798]  And I'm not even going to... Multiple quarters, folks.
[00:11:28.998 --> 00:11:30.059]  I wish I could tell you.
[00:11:30.079 --> 00:11:32.000]  This is a huge story in and of itself.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.722]  And he was told, shut up.
[00:11:37.182 --> 00:11:38.163]  Look at what happened to...
[00:11:39.645 --> 00:11:40.546]  Ritter, the U.N.
[00:11:40.786 --> 00:11:43.067]  weapons inspector, the Marine, now totally vindicated.
[00:11:43.508 --> 00:11:45.068]  And this happens over and over again.
[00:11:45.088 --> 00:11:49.251]  And he was told to shut up about it.
[00:11:49.611 --> 00:11:54.875]  In fact, it's in her own filing, and that's just one of the places he was told to shut up, that she didn't like the 9-11 filing.
[00:11:54.915 --> 00:11:56.856]  Well, again, I'm not going to say any more.
[00:11:57.176 --> 00:12:01.999]  He was told to shut up, but not just from her quarters, from other quarters.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:03.520]  Way above hers.
[00:12:04.634 --> 00:12:06.075]  And you imagine the courage.
[00:12:06.395 --> 00:12:08.656]  People kept saying, hey, Sheen needs to go to New York.
[00:12:08.716 --> 00:12:10.037]  He needs to protest out front.
[00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:12.278]  Sheen's bad if he doesn't do more for us.
[00:12:13.479 --> 00:12:25.766]  If you had any idea of the other stuff he's going through, the other things he's been threatened with, I just, again, I kept saying courage, courage, courage, amazing, stoic courage, courageous.
[00:12:26.386 --> 00:12:27.327]  These are the words.
[00:12:29.988 --> 00:12:33.370]  And now you're watching Charlie Sheen be totally torn apart.
[00:12:35.146 --> 00:12:37.128]  They're attempting to torpedo him to destroy him.
[00:12:37.569 --> 00:12:40.092]  I can tell you what he said in his court filing to hers.
[00:12:40.672 --> 00:12:42.134]  He said, I'm being extorted.
[00:12:44.196 --> 00:12:45.618]  And that's what's happened.
[00:12:45.678 --> 00:12:46.799]  She's very wealthy herself.
[00:12:46.819 --> 00:12:49.902]  She's demanding all this money and total control of the children.
[00:12:50.563 --> 00:12:51.945]  And then he says, well, you're wealthy yourself.
[00:12:51.985 --> 00:12:53.406]  I'll pay child support and pay for the kids.
[00:12:53.426 --> 00:12:55.909]  Of course I will, but why should I give you most of my wealth?
[00:12:56.929 --> 00:12:59.212]  And why should I just give you total control of the children?
[00:12:59.873 --> 00:13:06.502]  And so, basically, hey, you do what I want, or I'm going to go put all this stuff out in the public domain.
[00:13:06.522 --> 00:13:08.024]  That's what she says in her own filing.
[00:13:08.965 --> 00:13:10.627]  And so she calls that extortion.
[00:13:10.687 --> 00:13:11.649]  I don't know what you call it.
[00:13:11.909 --> 00:13:14.192]  There's a few other terms that you could use for it.
[00:13:16.135 --> 00:13:27.178]  The good news is, is that on blogs, on comments, on talk radio shows, I was on Man Cow, a big national show this morning, and he said he thinks it's all, you know, he agrees with Sheen that it's extortion.
[00:13:28.119 --> 00:13:38.722]  And so, I mean, I thought the backlash to the incredible allegations she made, most of which Sheen is saying are just complete frauds, totally manufactured, I think he's saying it all is.
[00:13:38.742 --> 00:13:45.704]  I mean, obviously some of it's true, like he's concerned about 9-11 and concerned about vaccines.
[00:13:47.134 --> 00:13:49.437]  Oh, and wanted his children to be breastfed.
[00:13:49.618 --> 00:13:50.379]  I forgot that.
[00:13:50.719 --> 00:13:55.165]  That's listed as part of the incredible evil of Charlie Sheen.
[00:13:56.507 --> 00:13:58.549]  Of why she says he's paranoid and delusional.
[00:13:58.569 --> 00:14:04.237]  He doesn't like vaccines, he's concerned about the 9-11 story, and he wants his children to be breastfed.
[00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:05.640]  Why?
[00:14:05.881 --> 00:14:07.021]  She says he's crazy.
[00:14:07.082 --> 00:14:09.363]  He thinks children get brain damaged if they're not.
[00:14:09.884 --> 00:14:13.346]  Type into Google, formula kills thousands.
[00:14:13.426 --> 00:14:16.048]  Formula kills, formula brain damages.
[00:14:16.068 --> 00:14:20.272]  I mean, that's been an ongoing national, international scandal for a decade.
[00:14:20.292 --> 00:14:23.594]  Remember the rice-based ones and the soy-based ones?
[00:14:24.355 --> 00:14:27.217]  The soy-based ones have all the hormones in it to screw your kids up.
[00:14:27.317 --> 00:14:29.899]  The rice-based ones don't have the...
[00:14:30.689 --> 00:14:33.651]  Have the animal fat that's needed for brain development, and the babies die.
[00:14:33.691 --> 00:14:36.793]  I mean, that's like saying, Charlie Sheen's crazy.
[00:14:38.094 --> 00:14:44.858]  He thinks cars run off gasoline, or he thinks trees sometimes have green leaves.
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.341]  Man, he thinks formula isn't good for kids.
[00:14:51.483 --> 00:14:53.044]  Man, he's bad.
[00:14:54.725 --> 00:14:58.267]  And as for the Internet stuff, anybody who's had a computer and surfed email and
[00:14:58.860 --> 00:14:59.541]  I think we're good to go.
[00:15:27.545 --> 00:15:30.688]  Because Sheen wouldn't do exactly what he was told in every respect.
[00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:37.834]  And again, the other stuff he's going through, I can't even get into.
[00:15:39.395 --> 00:15:41.637]  And I've already spent four or five minutes on this, and I'm done.
[00:15:42.477 --> 00:15:43.418]  I'm done talking about it.
[00:15:43.438 --> 00:15:46.540]  If you bring it up, if you ask me questions about it, I'm not getting into it.
[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:49.403]  That's my statement on it, and that's where I'm leaving it.
[00:15:49.883 --> 00:15:50.424]  End of story.
[00:15:50.444 --> 00:15:51.945]  I mean, I'm really getting sick of it.
[00:15:51.965 --> 00:15:53.886]  You know, I normally do interviews almost every day.
[00:15:53.926 --> 00:15:54.627]  I've cut back.
[00:15:55.942 --> 00:16:03.785]  But I've done some interviews the last few days, and the hosts all tell me I'm coming on to talk about China, I'm coming on to talk about Mexico, I'm coming to talk about the leaking in Bush.
[00:16:04.466 --> 00:16:06.527]  And then first thing out of their mouth is Charlie Sheen.
[00:16:06.667 --> 00:16:13.390]  And on a couple shows I just said I'm not going to talk about it, no comment, but Mancow was defending him, so I said a little bit, not much.
[00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:15.030]  I just repeated what Sheen said.
[00:16:17.151 --> 00:16:18.552]  But, I mean, look at it.
[00:16:18.592 --> 00:16:19.412]  Look what happened to him.
[00:16:20.913 --> 00:16:21.913]  And that's only the beginning.
[00:16:24.675 --> 00:16:25.315]  With these people.
[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:26.940]  These people.
[00:16:28.181 --> 00:16:29.222]  And there's a lot more I know.
[00:16:29.282 --> 00:16:30.483]  Again, if you only knew.
[00:16:30.503 --> 00:16:34.806]  I mean, this is like a real live thriller, spy thriller or something.
[00:16:36.688 --> 00:16:38.409]  I've had some stuff going on with myself.
[00:16:38.469 --> 00:16:51.078]  Somebody thinks it's real funny that in the parking lot of my house, in my driveway, they stuck a bunch of George Bush support the troop stickers all over my car, basically vandalized it, and I don't appreciate it, and I don't think it's funny.
[00:16:53.144 --> 00:16:57.186]  And just more of what you people... I do support the troops.
[00:16:57.566 --> 00:17:02.908]  You're the ones charging them $700 when their body armor gets shattered by an IED, by a bomb.
[00:17:03.448 --> 00:17:06.369]  You're the ones charging them $4 a day for their food when they're in the hospital.
[00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:09.491]  You're the ones that charge them to fly back with their arms and legs blown off.
[00:17:09.511 --> 00:17:11.572]  You're the ones that have got them breathing all this uranium.
[00:17:12.092 --> 00:17:19.615]  You're the ones that have got them with force re-upping where they've served two, three, four terms in Iraq or overseas and they extend their contracts.
[00:17:21.235 --> 00:17:26.559]  You're the ones that think Bush's open border, gun-grabbing, UN-supporting policies are great.
[00:17:26.639 --> 00:17:31.823]  And so fine, just don't come around my house and don't stick stuff on my car.
[00:17:32.383 --> 00:17:37.347]  That's illegal to mess with somebody's car and to come into their driveway.
[00:17:38.387 --> 00:17:40.589]  And believe me, you don't want me to catch you doing it.
[00:17:41.389 --> 00:17:41.930]  Believe me.
[00:17:43.051 --> 00:17:45.953]  And no, I'm not going to come out and be stupid and knock you upside the head.
[00:17:46.973 --> 00:17:48.975]  I'm going to file charges on you for stalking.
[00:17:49.873 --> 00:17:51.154]  Like I've done to other people.
[00:17:51.194 --> 00:17:52.234]  And I'm going to take you to court.
[00:17:52.254 --> 00:17:54.395]  And it doesn't matter if you beat the rap.
[00:17:54.415 --> 00:17:55.716]  You're not going to beat the ride.
[00:17:56.436 --> 00:17:58.117]  So I will take you for a ride.
[00:17:58.477 --> 00:17:59.498]  I will hurt you.
[00:17:59.938 --> 00:18:00.598]  Financially.
[00:18:01.418 --> 00:18:02.019]  Guaranteed.
[00:18:02.779 --> 00:18:04.020]  Stay away from my family.
[00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.620]  There's other stuff going on too.
[00:18:06.021 --> 00:18:07.241]  Stay away from my house.
[00:18:07.861 --> 00:18:08.942]  You piece of trash.
[00:18:12.183 --> 00:18:12.424]  Alright.
[00:18:15.405 --> 00:18:16.365]  I'm really mad right now.
[00:18:16.385 --> 00:18:18.406]  In fact, I don't like getting angry.
[00:18:19.007 --> 00:18:19.127]  And...
[00:18:23.479 --> 00:18:25.620]  I got a long driveway that goes around the back of my house.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.960]  And so somebody basically was in my backyard.
[00:18:33.942 --> 00:18:36.042]  It's been a few years since that kind of stuff's been going on.
[00:18:36.062 --> 00:18:38.443]  At least it's not a dead animal like I've had before.
[00:18:38.523 --> 00:18:39.403]  But you know what?
[00:18:40.083 --> 00:18:40.403]  Again.
[00:18:40.423 --> 00:18:42.424]  Oh, man.
[00:18:43.424 --> 00:18:43.884]  All right.
[00:18:45.305 --> 00:18:47.325]  You see, people are such trash.
[00:18:47.885 --> 00:18:50.286]  You're such un-American scum.
[00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:53.211]  You're everything wrong with this world.
[00:18:53.231 --> 00:18:54.732]  You're everything wrong with humanity.
[00:18:55.112 --> 00:18:57.314]  You're everything shameful about the species.
[00:18:58.174 --> 00:19:02.818]  And I know you're well-meaning, gibbering, just stupid, dumb as dirt.
[00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:05.139]  I understand you want to turn your guns in.
[00:19:05.599 --> 00:19:07.421]  I understand you love being a slave.
[00:19:07.821 --> 00:19:10.002]  I understand you like your kids being in debt.
[00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:12.604]  I understand you're just idiots, okay?
[00:19:12.684 --> 00:19:14.826]  Believe me, I understand you think it's cute and it's funny.
[00:19:15.646 --> 00:19:16.267]  It's not funny.
[00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:21.370]  Alright.
[00:19:24.662 --> 00:19:28.625]  Yeah, I got more comments on the Chinese woman, too, who they're now charging.
[00:19:29.906 --> 00:19:31.067]  I'll cover that when we get back.
[00:19:31.488 --> 00:19:35.351]  They're charging her with intimidating a foreign official, which is in the terrorism category.
[00:19:36.271 --> 00:19:38.533]  She faces, what, six months to a year in federal prison.
[00:19:38.553 --> 00:19:41.476]  They're saying because she said your days are numbered.
[00:19:41.496 --> 00:19:42.536]  Well, it's completely out of context.
[00:19:42.556 --> 00:19:46.540]  She said the Communist Party's oppression and abuse to Falun Gong is numbered.
[00:19:49.542 --> 00:19:50.122]  So we'll get into it.
[00:19:50.142 --> 00:19:50.823]  It's just shameful.
[00:19:50.843 --> 00:19:53.045]  We're becoming China at every level, every facet.
[00:19:53.948 --> 00:19:57.412]  And we'll get into the open borders, we'll get into Iran, we'll get into the leaks.
[00:19:58.313 --> 00:19:59.815]  All the hypocrisy is coming up.
[00:19:59.855 --> 00:20:00.956]  This is Planet.TV.
[00:20:02.038 --> 00:20:08.005]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:20:16.493 --> 00:20:21.074]  The Nationalist Times is a 20-page newspaper featuring outstanding writers and columnists who don't believe in taboos or sacred cows.
[00:20:35.499 --> 00:20:37.500]  That's The Nationalist Times, PO Box 426, Allison Park, PA 15101.

[00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:04.731]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:05.131 --> 00:21:10.614]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:21:11.174 --> 00:21:11.674]  That's right.
[00:21:11.995 --> 00:21:14.276]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:21:14.836 --> 00:21:21.760]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:30.018]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:30.458 --> 00:21:35.263]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:21:35.842 --> 00:21:36.503]  We're good to go.
[00:21:36.523 --> 00:21:36.683]  I think?
[00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:05.192]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:22:05.472 --> 00:22:08.974]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:22:09.054 --> 00:22:12.996]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:22:13.216 --> 00:22:19.379]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:27.704]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:22:28.104 --> 00:22:33.450]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:37.373]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:22:37.754 --> 00:22:39.596]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[00:22:39.676 --> 00:22:41.838]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:22:42.078 --> 00:22:47.323]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:22:47.363 --> 00:22:51.167]  Hit the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-
[00:22:51.988 --> 00:22:55.511]  803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:22:55.751 --> 00:22:59.834]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[00:23:00.935 --> 00:23:04.517]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[00:23:04.777 --> 00:23:05.638]  Look no further.

[00:23:28.391 --> 00:23:31.212]  You won't find a better selection of books or videos anywhere.

[00:23:55.872 --> 00:23:56.453]  Box 281 Wildwood, PA 15091.
[00:24:28.254 --> 00:24:47.368]  So this valiant, calm, young member of the doctor, middle-aged woman, stands up and speaks out against how they're harvesting organs, how they have people in death camps, and says that the Communist Party's days of basically abusing the Chinese people are numbered.
[00:24:47.508 --> 00:24:53.512]  She says, you can go read the exact quote, and the media spins that, our media, to, well, she kind of threatened him.
[00:24:55.254 --> 00:25:07.341]  And so they held her for a couple days, and now they are openly saying they're going to charge her, not just with disorderly conduct, but with intimidating a foreign official, which is in the new terrorism categories.
[00:25:08.002 --> 00:25:16.727]  So she can spend quite a long visit, stay, with the feds in Club Fed.
[00:25:18.528 --> 00:25:19.769]  Just like, I guess, in China.
[00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:21.870]  Maybe they'll start taking people's organs here, too.
[00:25:22.992 --> 00:25:26.355]  I mean, after all, you can't have someone like this disrupting things.
[00:25:27.196 --> 00:25:30.178]  After all, this is the land of the slaves and home of the surveilled.
[00:25:31.919 --> 00:25:34.061]  So I'm done talking about that subject.
[00:25:34.101 --> 00:25:36.003]  I've got an editorial here that's pretty good.
[00:25:36.063 --> 00:25:36.583]  Whose visit?
[00:25:36.623 --> 00:25:37.504]  Nothing to celebrate.
[00:25:37.524 --> 00:25:39.466]  Of course, it's by Nancy Pelosi.
[00:25:39.506 --> 00:25:46.351]  I wonder if she was upset, if the congresswoman was upset when Bill Clinton was going along with the CHICOMs.
[00:25:47.112 --> 00:25:49.074]  Again, they own and control both parties.
[00:25:50.535 --> 00:25:52.538]  You've got to understand, you can't run to the Democrats.
[00:25:52.578 --> 00:25:54.781]  They're not going to save you either.
[00:25:54.801 --> 00:25:58.566]  That's why we're in so much trouble in this country.
[00:26:00.288 --> 00:26:06.557]  Now, let me get into the subject of thermite bombs, thermite charges in the North and South Towers on 9-11.
[00:26:07.757 --> 00:26:14.418]  We know they collapsed and there were temperatures of 3,000 degrees the first few days and down to 2,300 in the next few weeks.
[00:26:14.518 --> 00:26:17.959]  A month later, it was still thousands and thousands of degrees.
[00:26:17.999 --> 00:26:26.801]  And these are from NASA and also aircraft that were doing thermal scans of the wound in the ground, the pile of smoking rubble.
[00:26:28.441 --> 00:26:32.782]  Jet fuel doesn't get anywhere near even 1,500 degrees, burns between 1,200 and 1,400 degrees.
[00:26:36.247 --> 00:26:38.508]  Steel doesn't start to redden and even weaken until 3000.
[00:26:38.608 --> 00:26:41.850]  It doesn't become molten until well over 4000.
[00:26:42.571 --> 00:27:03.082]  And so Professor Stephen Jones, who is a physicist, a tenured physicist at BYU, a senior professor there, Brigham Young University, first came out in a newspaper article, then we interviewed him first on the radio, and he went further than he had in the news article in the Desert News and said...
[00:27:04.188 --> 00:27:12.874]  He brought up the thousands and thousands of degree temperatures in the rubble for weeks and weeks, and he said only thermite can do that.
[00:27:14.354 --> 00:27:30.164]  Only thermite that burns, what, over 4,000 degrees and then causes steel to melt and then leaves it in a molten form, and there had to be a lot of molten steel for it to stay molten and maintain its heat for weeks and weeks.
[00:27:30.184 --> 00:27:31.365]  It's just unprecedented.
[00:27:32.913 --> 00:27:36.094]  And so researchers began to watch the official footage.
[00:27:36.874 --> 00:27:40.015]  And we have these clips up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:27:40.375 --> 00:27:42.115]  An article we put together today on this.
[00:27:43.436 --> 00:27:48.217]  The researchers out there, the army of private citizens, began to watch the video closely.
[00:27:48.817 --> 00:27:53.278]  And there are multiple photographs and multiple videos up close of the wounds in the buildings.
[00:27:54.824 --> 00:28:01.825]  With people standing just 10, 15 yards away who are waving white shirts, begging for helicopter rescue.
[00:28:02.386 --> 00:28:08.087]  So understand, there isn't massive continual heat in those areas that you would imagine from jet fuel still burning.
[00:28:08.127 --> 00:28:17.809]  No, just at key points, at key points where you have major support columns, you see, because it still takes thermite a while to burn through these giant 40 plus inch, 47 inch, 44...
[00:28:20.575 --> 00:28:22.156]  An inch column is 47 of them.
[00:28:22.556 --> 00:28:27.097]  It still takes time for the thermite to melt through it or whatever is melting through it.
[00:28:27.597 --> 00:28:36.780]  And you see gouts of what looks like white hot lava gushing out of the major support columns.
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:48.884]  And you can tell when fuel is burning it's dripping and burning and has black smoke coming off of it and it's red because gasoline which burns hotter than jet fuel jet fuel is basically kerosene
[00:28:49.777 --> 00:28:52.499]  Jet fuel burns even cooler and burns red.
[00:28:52.519 --> 00:28:57.342]  That's what a coal burning fire does at the lower temperatures of combustion.
[00:28:58.143 --> 00:28:59.384]  And it puts off a lot of smoke.
[00:28:59.424 --> 00:29:00.625]  This isn't putting off smoke.
[00:29:00.665 --> 00:29:06.408]  This is white hot pouring out of the sides of the buildings.
[00:29:06.609 --> 00:29:07.809]  And it looks like metal.
[00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:11.572]  In fact, only metal does that burning white hot.
[00:29:13.636 --> 00:29:19.281]  So it is just amazing to now see the evidence of this.
[00:29:20.742 --> 00:29:23.284]  And I would call it 98% conclusive.
[00:29:23.965 --> 00:29:29.289]  Because we also have videos of thermite reactions done in laboratories on steel, and it's identical.
[00:29:30.871 --> 00:29:31.771]  It's identical.
[00:29:34.514 --> 00:29:40.759]  So, and even some mainstream physicists and scientists and engineers that have looked at it,
[00:29:42.202 --> 00:29:47.650]  Art's saying it looks like thermite now, so it's just a huge bombshell.
[00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:50.574]  We'll talk more about it, cover some other news, then take your calls.
[00:29:51.936 --> 00:29:52.837]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.337 --> 00:29:54.940]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.861 --> 00:29:58.545]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:32:02.203 --> 00:32:05.346]  If you had to flee your home in three minutes, what would you bring?
[00:32:06.303 --> 00:32:13.044]  Wouldn't it be nice if you had all of your important items in one place and ready to grab just in case you had to leave quickly in an emergency?
[00:32:16.355 --> 00:32:21.596]  Guardian Angel Preparedness specializes in survival products and 72-hour survival kits.

[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:41.721]  Remember, it wasn't raining when Noah built the ark.
[00:32:41.741 --> 00:32:44.703]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents...
[00:33:09.033 --> 00:33:11.534]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:18.978 --> 00:33:30.784]  Joe, Mark, Century, and others, your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:33:34.318 --> 00:33:37.039]  Let me just read this article that Paul Watson and I put together.
[00:33:37.139 --> 00:33:39.860]  Thermite identified as culprit of WTC collapse.
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.621]  Evidence mounting the cause.
[00:33:42.501 --> 00:33:45.722]  First identified on Alex Jones Show led to tower implosion.
[00:33:46.862 --> 00:33:53.125]  A new branch of 911 research claims to identify the cause of the collapse of the Twin Towers.
[00:33:53.245 --> 00:34:02.708]  The photographic and video evidence makes a very strong case for thermite being responsible for the unprecedented implosion of steel-framed reinforced buildings on September 11th.
[00:34:04.068 --> 00:34:11.792]  This facet was first brought to light during a November 2005 appearance on the Alex Jones Show by Brigham Young University physicist Professor Steven Jones.
[00:34:12.433 --> 00:34:18.756]  Jones said that white phosphorus wasn't powerful enough to cause the implosion, but the thermite was a likely culprit.
[00:34:19.377 --> 00:34:30.363]  The Alex Jones 2005 release of martial law arrived at the police state and highlighted the physical evidence that the towers and Building 7 were brought down with incendiary devices.
[00:34:31.269 --> 00:34:48.621]  Brigham Young University physicist Professor Stephen Jones told peers at a Utah meeting that while almost no fire, even one ignited by jet fuel can cause structural steel to fail, the combination of thermite and sulfur slices through steel like a hot knife through butter.
[00:34:49.341 --> 00:34:57.427]  Jones points out to a video, click here to watch, which shows a bright yellow molten substance dripping from the south tower.
[00:34:58.487 --> 00:34:59.388]  It's really quite hot.
[00:35:00.513 --> 00:35:11.796]  Minutes before the collapse, government investigators claimed that this was aluminum from Flight 175, but Jones is adamant that aluminum is silvery in appearance and doesn't turn yellow.
[00:35:11.816 --> 00:35:12.956]  Well, it's more than that.
[00:35:12.976 --> 00:35:17.857]  It flakes, and jet fuel doesn't heat it up enough to do that.
[00:35:17.877 --> 00:35:20.678]  I mean, try sticking aluminum in a white-hot fire.
[00:35:20.698 --> 00:35:21.438]  It just shrivels up.
[00:35:22.532 --> 00:35:33.060]  Jones also told the Desert News that sulfur traces found at ground zero indicate the thermite was combined with sulfur to make it burn even hotter than the normal 2,500 degrees Celsius.
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:34.881]  Yeah, I can send it up over 3,500.
[00:35:35.621 --> 00:35:41.606]  Jones stated that thermite was a clever choice because its ingredients, aluminum and iron oxide, do not require...
[00:35:42.333 --> 00:35:47.336]  Identifying tags by law, meaning that they couldn't be traced back to the manufacturers.
[00:35:47.956 --> 00:36:02.685]  Watch the following video and observe how thermite completely melts a car engine in a matter of seconds without the addition of sulfur and also completely resists neutralization by liquid nitrogen.
[00:36:03.105 --> 00:36:07.747]  Notice how the dripping substance is identical to that seen in the South Tower video.
[00:36:09.368 --> 00:36:10.209]  And it continues...
[00:36:11.027 --> 00:36:17.929]  Jones also cited video pictures showing white ash rising from the South Tower near the dripping liquefied material.
[00:36:17.969 --> 00:36:21.590]  When thermite burns, Jones said, it releases aluminum oxide ash.
[00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:29.452]  The presence of yellow, both yellow, white, molten iron, and aluminum oxide ash are signature characteristics of thermite reaction, he said.
[00:36:30.172 --> 00:36:39.015]  American Free Press writer Christopher Boleyn discusses evidence of thermite used to sever the Twin Tower steel support columns in the picture below.
[00:36:39.035 --> 00:36:40.195]  And it goes on.
[00:36:40.848 --> 00:36:46.071]  In this photo, for example, the column directly above the fireman's helmet shows that it was cut with thermite.
[00:36:46.111 --> 00:36:54.636]  You can see it perfectly cut with shape charges, sliced off perfectly, and then with all the molten dripping steel from the cut points.
[00:36:54.856 --> 00:36:55.937]  I mean, there's no debating it.
[00:36:56.937 --> 00:36:58.198]  This was taken just hours after.
[00:36:58.238 --> 00:37:00.059]  That's why they later said no photos.
[00:37:01.431 --> 00:37:02.872]  Again, this is so important, folks.
[00:37:02.892 --> 00:37:04.493]  This is what we pointed out over and over again.
[00:37:04.693 --> 00:37:08.715]  In this photo, for example, the column directly above the fireman's helmet shows that it was cut with thermite.
[00:37:09.176 --> 00:37:14.479]  There's a substantial amount of hardened molten iron, which can be seen on both the inside and the outside of the box column.
[00:37:15.719 --> 00:37:20.182]  This is precisely what one would expect to find on a column which had been cut with thermite, says Bolin.
[00:37:21.122 --> 00:37:30.628]  White flames consistent with how thermite reacts, producing molten iron and aluminum oxide, are also visible in this photograph at the corner of the 81st floor on the south tower.
[00:37:31.266 --> 00:37:45.669]  The USGS spectroscopy lab produces images which showed dense thermal hot spots days and weeks after the attacks.
[00:37:46.089 --> 00:37:58.372]  ABC News reports that the temperature at the core of the pile is near 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, and that was weeks later, according to fire officials who add that the fires are also too deep for firefighters to get to.
[00:38:00.743 --> 00:38:02.104]  And of course, what really happened?
[00:38:02.885 --> 00:38:11.311]  Website created a page giving more proof that thermite was used and how it runs parallel with eyewitness reports of explosions and pieces being sheared off the towers.
[00:38:11.351 --> 00:38:15.394]  An additional video shows white smoke pictured at the base of the North Tower.
[00:38:15.834 --> 00:38:19.937]  Moments before its collapse, white smoke also arose from the wreckage of the towers.
[00:38:20.297 --> 00:38:29.464]  It is now all but conclusive that the master architects of the 9-11 attacks used thermite to implode the towers, going to extra length to pull off
[00:38:30.004 --> 00:38:32.326]  Yes, that's exactly what's going on here.
[00:38:32.406 --> 00:38:35.129]  And this is just so classic to witness all of this happening.
[00:38:56.761 --> 00:39:04.206]  So it's not enough to have large explosives in the building to give you that top-down pancaking look.
[00:39:04.226 --> 00:39:12.331]  You also, I guess they doubly wanted to be sure, to make sure the columns were all extremely weakened by having thermite charges on them.
[00:39:12.351 --> 00:39:24.299]  Because you look at these photos, and you can see the big columns that are perfectly sliced off with molten steel dripping from the perfect slices.
[00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:27.731]  As if a giant cutting torch was on it.
[00:39:28.932 --> 00:39:31.373]  I mean, it is just ridiculously obvious.
[00:39:31.393 --> 00:39:38.236]  Just like Oklahoma City, where you have the big concrete columns with rebar perfectly blasted off, and the rebar perfectly cut.
[00:39:38.916 --> 00:39:44.299]  And then demolition experts, former head of Air Force, weapons development, General Benton K. Parton, many others go public.
[00:39:44.599 --> 00:39:45.379]  Look at the photos.
[00:39:45.439 --> 00:39:47.040]  Columns further back from the truck.
[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:49.921]  Then columns right up against the rider truck.
[00:39:50.422 --> 00:39:51.222]  Aren't even harmed.
[00:39:52.168 --> 00:39:52.548]  We're good to go.
[00:39:52.568 --> 00:39:52.708]  I think?
[00:40:16.348 --> 00:40:18.469]  Cut around and use the stairs sometimes.
[00:40:18.949 --> 00:40:21.170]  There was a big rush, people getting into work in the morning.
[00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:36.636]  She said she did it for exercise, and she was back in there in the maintenance shafts that she had a key to going up the maintenance stairwell to her office and saw these guys, quote, putting big sticks of gray butter and maintenance uniforms on columns.
[00:40:36.696 --> 00:40:40.717]  She didn't know what that was, but she sure found out later.
[00:40:41.458 --> 00:40:42.758]  And that was what the day before.
[00:40:42.798 --> 00:40:43.758]  That was on April 18th.
[00:40:47.509 --> 00:40:54.552]  And the next morning at 9.01 a.m., we all know what happened 11 years ago.
[00:40:54.572 --> 00:41:04.556]  And then, of course, as usual, we have the University of Oklahoma seismographs, the USGS seismographs clearly showing the explosions.
[00:41:04.596 --> 00:41:09.678]  And you have the BATF in all their gear seconds after it went off telling police we're warned not to go into work.
[00:41:09.758 --> 00:41:15.781]  And we have the BATF months before in New Mexico at a proving ground blowing up rider trucks.
[00:41:17.163 --> 00:41:18.384]  I mean, it gets pretty ridiculous.
[00:41:18.844 --> 00:41:22.286]  In fact, I hate to even say the government was behind Oklahoma City without getting into the evidence.
[00:41:22.306 --> 00:41:30.090]  I mean, we have Al-Husseini Husseini, these Iraqis in the rider trucks, videotaped FBI agents saying they saw the video.
[00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:33.012]  We know Al-Husseini Husseini and others were captured by police.
[00:41:33.212 --> 00:41:34.192]  Clinton ordered their release.
[00:41:34.613 --> 00:41:40.076]  They were caught at the airport with baggies full of wire cutters and wiring and blue jogging suits.
[00:41:40.096 --> 00:41:42.477]  I mean, that's how arrogant they are in their order to be released.
[00:41:43.553 --> 00:41:48.034]  And the government declares national security in three separate trials, not allowing those tapes to be released.
[00:41:48.074 --> 00:41:52.695]  I mean, if you've got McVeigh getting out of the rider truck by himself on 12 different cameras, why not just show us the tape?
[00:41:55.096 --> 00:41:57.316]  And again, we have FBI agents on record saying they saw the tape.
[00:41:57.616 --> 00:41:58.676]  It shows a bunch of Arabs.
[00:41:59.597 --> 00:42:02.677]  People go, well, then see, that shows the Arabs attacked us.
[00:42:03.398 --> 00:42:08.519]  Yes, Arabs we know who were trained in the 80s as allies of the U.S., Republican Guard trained in the U.S.
[00:42:08.559 --> 00:42:09.399]  at military bases.
[00:42:10.131 --> 00:42:14.294]  As double agents, and then brought back in by Bill Clinton and George Bush Sr., L.A.
[00:42:14.335 --> 00:42:20.259]  Times, Washington Times in 92, and then again in 93 when Clinton got elected, he brought in 2,000, Bush Sr.
[00:42:20.279 --> 00:42:29.587]  brought in over 3,000, and they're right here now, Iraqi CIA terror teams ready to level this country when the globalists give one order.
[00:42:29.907 --> 00:42:32.189]  They're all waiting in every major city, every major town.
[00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:35.852]  This is a special forces tactic, by the way.
[00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:39.492]  We have deep cover agents placed.
[00:42:40.012 --> 00:42:41.874]  In the Cold War, the Russians did that here.
[00:42:42.014 --> 00:42:43.155]  Our government did that there.
[00:42:43.175 --> 00:42:48.579]  We have deep cover individuals with weapons caches pre-placed.
[00:42:49.219 --> 00:42:53.663]  They're ready to hit every nuclear plant, every power plant, every city hall, every capital.
[00:42:54.243 --> 00:42:55.144]  They've got rockets.
[00:42:55.184 --> 00:42:55.985]  They've got chemical.
[00:42:56.005 --> 00:42:57.446]  They've got biological weapons.
[00:42:58.006 --> 00:43:02.710]  They train super-secret special forces groups even above Delta Force.
[00:43:03.803 --> 00:43:19.450]  In how to say go into a high-rise building with just a few gallons of deadly nerve gas, place it with a timer on top of the air conditioning vents that bring in air from the outside, and it'll kill almost everybody in the building and cause total panic.
[00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:24.972]  And they've got programs to put small nukes in buildings.
[00:43:25.392 --> 00:43:27.293]  They've got programs on blowing dams.
[00:43:28.434 --> 00:43:30.155]  They've got programs just on everything.
[00:43:31.475 --> 00:43:32.716]  I mean, a squad of 10, 12 people
[00:43:34.031 --> 00:43:37.153]  And can just totally turn every major city in the country.
[00:43:37.173 --> 00:43:40.935]  So you're talking about a few 500 people can bring the whole U.S.
[00:43:40.955 --> 00:43:41.595]  to its knees.
[00:43:42.816 --> 00:43:44.137]  And when they're supplied by the U.S.
[00:43:44.177 --> 00:43:49.860]  government... By the way, don't think the globalists won't pull something like this.
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:52.602]  I mean, do you understand what we're dealing with here?
[00:43:52.642 --> 00:43:58.225]  We've been picked as the target by our own government as a way to scare us into submission and mobilize us to have a world government.
[00:44:03.567 --> 00:44:04.367]  It's mind-blowing.
[00:44:08.148 --> 00:44:16.170]  I mean, seriously, our whole way of life, our security, our future, it's all in trouble.
[00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:22.111]  Even if you don't believe that the government was involved in 9-11, the criminal elements weren't involved.
[00:44:22.151 --> 00:44:33.073]  If you believe in the Tooth Fairy, in Santa Claus, in unicorns, in the Easter Bunny,
[00:44:34.312 --> 00:44:36.094]  If you believe in mermaids, fine.
[00:44:37.175 --> 00:44:49.368]  If you believe 19 guys from a cave ran those attacks and warned public officials not to fly and did CIA-tracked insider trading in billions and billions in the four days before directly on the two airlines that got hit...
[00:44:50.362 --> 00:44:51.103]  We're good to go.
[00:44:51.123 --> 00:44:51.263]  I think?
[00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:23.421]  I mean, if you believe all that, fine.
[00:45:24.341 --> 00:45:24.741]  Fine.
[00:45:24.881 --> 00:45:25.342]  Believe it.
[00:45:26.422 --> 00:45:30.244]  But what about the border still being wide open?
[00:45:30.624 --> 00:45:32.585]  And folks, this has really been hurting the globalists.
[00:45:33.906 --> 00:45:34.986]  That's why they arrested .00004.
[00:45:40.001 --> 00:45:46.084]  1,000 arrests of 25 million illegal aliens, and it's more than that, but let's use a conservative number.
[00:45:46.124 --> 00:45:47.165]  They're 14 million.
[00:45:47.185 --> 00:45:48.205]  They admit low.
[00:45:48.225 --> 00:45:49.446]  12 over 20 million.
[00:45:49.706 --> 00:45:50.967]  Really over 30, but let's say 25.
[00:45:51.547 --> 00:45:52.447]  Just pick in the middle.
[00:45:53.268 --> 00:45:53.568]  That is .00004.
[00:45:53.648 --> 00:45:54.949]  We did the math last week.
[00:45:54.969 --> 00:45:59.971]  If they arrested 1,000 a day for 365 days, that's under 1% of the illegal aliens in this country.
[00:46:09.099 --> 00:46:12.362]  So I guess they need to arrest, what, 50,000 a day or something.
[00:46:12.402 --> 00:46:15.324]  I mean, that's how big this problem is.
[00:46:20.429 --> 00:46:22.991]  And now Hillary wants a border fence.
[00:46:23.451 --> 00:46:24.873]  Oh, she's so conservative.
[00:46:25.053 --> 00:46:26.134]  Oh, we love Hillary now.
[00:46:26.849 --> 00:46:38.215]  But if you actually go read what she's proposing, she wants to legalize everybody who's here and just make them thumb scan and face scan, which citizens already do, and then just legalize all of them and have a, quote, virtual fence.
[00:46:38.235 --> 00:46:42.397]  See, but people don't read deeper into the articles.
[00:46:42.478 --> 00:46:43.358]  It's not even between the lines.
[00:46:43.378 --> 00:46:50.602]  They just don't read into the actual declaration, the actual legislation, the actual what Bush and Hillary are calling for.
[00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:55.682]  And the Democrats and Republicans are together on this.
[00:46:55.702 --> 00:47:08.293]  They're all for the Voter Help America Vote Act, the Voter Assistance Act, which federalizes and puts in all these scam computers connected to the government and totally caught engaging in election fraud coast to coast.
[00:47:08.794 --> 00:47:10.695]  They're all together on signing on to UNESCO.
[00:47:10.715 --> 00:47:12.577]  Bush was with Hillary on the assault weapons ban.
[00:47:12.897 --> 00:47:13.838]  Bush was with Schumer.
[00:47:14.419 --> 00:47:16.761]  Bush was for signing on to all these other treaties.
[00:47:17.021 --> 00:47:19.103]  I mean, he hasn't vetoed one bill.
[00:47:23.055 --> 00:47:24.716]  He's doubled, oh, more than doubled.
[00:47:24.736 --> 00:47:25.757]  I keep using two-year-old numbers.
[00:47:26.117 --> 00:47:28.739]  They say now it's getting close to two and a half times.
[00:47:28.799 --> 00:47:31.620]  And by the time he leaves, a tripling in government.
[00:47:32.601 --> 00:47:33.121]  Tripling!
[00:47:33.501 --> 00:47:39.605]  More money spent than all presidents before him, and the neocons go, that's for defense, we're in an emergency.
[00:47:40.105 --> 00:47:45.588]  No, that's only about 30% of the spending increase.
[00:47:46.599 --> 00:48:09.988]  It's substantive, but no, doubling the size of the BATF, doubling the size of the Department of Education, doubling the size of the Department of Human Services, Health and Human Services, doubling the size of the Transportation Department, creating Homeland Security, creating over 25 other agencies, on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
[00:48:10.848 --> 00:48:15.010]  And by the way, the $200 billion that they're saying they're going to spend on Katrina, they've only spent about $100 billion so far.
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:18.401]  That is tiny compared to all the rest of it.
[00:48:18.421 --> 00:48:19.122]  So it isn't the war.
[00:48:19.162 --> 00:48:19.882]  It isn't Katrina.
[00:48:20.242 --> 00:48:20.922]  It's just good.
[00:48:20.982 --> 00:48:24.704]  He makes FDR and LBJ and Bill Clinton.
[00:48:26.305 --> 00:48:27.465]  Nixon ballooned the government.
[00:48:27.505 --> 00:48:28.186]  He makes Nixon.
[00:48:28.806 --> 00:48:29.666]  All of those guys.
[00:48:29.746 --> 00:48:33.588]  Jimmy Carter, Reagan, Bush Sr.
[00:48:35.269 --> 00:48:36.630]  Back to George Washington.
[00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:39.451]  More money than all of them combined.
[00:48:39.471 --> 00:48:40.091]  That's official.
[00:48:40.131 --> 00:48:41.552]  You can read that in the Dallas Morning News.
[00:48:44.289 --> 00:48:45.510]  And they've got conservative numbers.
[00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:53.235]  The numbers I've got from economists, like Morgan Reynolds and Paul Craig Roberts and many others, is that it's much worse.
[00:48:54.076 --> 00:48:54.416]  What is it?
[00:48:54.936 --> 00:48:57.498]  Last time I checked, $87 trillion in debt.
[00:48:58.319 --> 00:48:59.880]  It's not $9 trillion like you heard.
[00:49:02.342 --> 00:49:07.865]  That's like, oh, you owe $500 on your car payment this month, but on the life of the car, you owe $35,000.
[00:49:09.645 --> 00:49:15.327]  So, see, that's what we currently owe, and the new Fed chief is printing money like it's going out of style.
[00:49:16.007 --> 00:49:19.949]  I mean, seriously, are you living on Cuckoo Bird Island, you Bush supporters?
[00:49:21.509 --> 00:49:23.390]  And I'll tell you dumb liberals something, too.
[00:49:23.790 --> 00:49:27.072]  The Democratic Party isn't your friend, but I'm glad the liberals are waking up.
[00:49:27.732 --> 00:49:31.813]  Everywhere I look, there's articles of people saying Hillary's horrible, Bill Clinton's horrible.
[00:49:32.153 --> 00:49:33.894]  They've got the Democratic Party.
[00:49:33.914 --> 00:49:35.135]  They're a bunch of scum.
[00:49:35.615 --> 00:49:38.796]  Democrats will listen to me now, but Democrats, I know, are out buying guns.
[00:49:39.833 --> 00:49:40.994]  They're not Democrats anymore.
[00:49:41.274 --> 00:49:42.395]  They're now free thinkers.
[00:49:42.435 --> 00:49:43.595]  They now shifted paradigm.
[00:49:43.955 --> 00:49:53.201]  Not you, most of you, a lot of conservatives have woken up, but there's that hardcore group that will never wake up, cannot wake up.
[00:49:55.322 --> 00:49:56.943]  And I don't know what your problem is.
[00:49:56.963 --> 00:50:01.966]  I mean, I'm here coldly looking at the facts, and I can't believe how bad they are.
[00:50:02.026 --> 00:50:03.907]  I mean, this is like a bad dream.
[00:50:08.812 --> 00:50:10.472]  I'm totally confused.
[00:50:10.512 --> 00:50:12.613]  I mean, I can't believe it's this crazy.
[00:50:13.613 --> 00:50:16.954]  Meanwhile, Bush comes out and leaks to burn Valerie Plame.
[00:50:16.974 --> 00:50:17.634]  That's now admitted.
[00:50:17.654 --> 00:50:18.474]  He doesn't get in trouble.
[00:50:19.654 --> 00:50:25.555]  And then a lady at the CIA valiantly, a high-level officer, leaks they've got secret torture death camps.
[00:50:25.595 --> 00:50:26.615]  They kill people at these.
[00:50:26.815 --> 00:50:27.836]  And of course they're all innocent.
[00:50:27.856 --> 00:50:30.656]  It's to get fake confessions.
[00:50:30.936 --> 00:50:32.717]  Top Delta Force people have gone public about this.
[00:50:32.737 --> 00:50:34.837]  Who do you think does the snatching and grabbing, by the way?
[00:50:37.412 --> 00:50:39.973]  And she reports criminal activity.
[00:50:40.813 --> 00:50:42.413]  Criminal activity.
[00:50:45.074 --> 00:50:50.095]  And she's been fired and they're talking about arresting her, indicting her for treason.
[00:50:51.936 --> 00:50:55.457]  You're supposed to report criminal activity.
[00:50:57.277 --> 00:50:58.038]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:58.058 --> 00:50:58.398]  Stay with us.
[00:50:58.418 --> 00:50:59.598]  We'll go right to your calls when we get back.
[00:51:03.174 --> 00:51:06.015]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:06.295 --> 00:51:07.876]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:08.216 --> 00:51:12.878]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:13.218 --> 00:51:17.660]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:22.282]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:22.482 --> 00:51:25.323]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:25.403 --> 00:51:27.924]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[00:51:28.104 --> 00:51:28.665]  We're good to go.
[00:51:52.943 --> 00:51:57.091]  That's Infowars.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:51:57.232 --> 00:51:59.917]  Or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:08.534]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:52:08.674 --> 00:52:14.837]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:52:15.118 --> 00:52:23.563]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:52:23.803 --> 00:52:30.827]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:52:31.127 --> 00:52:35.950]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:41.574]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:52:41.914 --> 00:52:44.996]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:52:45.317 --> 00:52:53.322]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:53.342 --> 00:52:53.922]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:03.590 --> 00:53:04.111]  We're good to go.
[00:53:18.889 --> 00:53:19.549]  We're good to go.
[00:53:34.434 --> 00:53:34.854]  We're good to go.
[00:54:03.764 --> 00:54:14.288]  We've got Glenn Spencer scheduled via his aeroplane, flying low over the border, joining us the next hour.
[00:54:14.308 --> 00:54:17.289]  A lot of other news I haven't even gotten to yet.
[00:54:17.329 --> 00:54:17.990]  It's so important.
[00:54:18.010 --> 00:54:18.850]  I hope you'll stay with us.
[00:54:20.351 --> 00:54:23.592]  I just love this country, and it's so sad to see all these bad things happening to it.
[00:54:24.511 --> 00:54:26.752]  Help us expose the murderers that carried out 9-11.
[00:54:26.792 --> 00:54:27.893]  Get my film, Martial Law.
[00:54:27.913 --> 00:54:28.754]  Get Road to Tyranny.
[00:54:28.794 --> 00:54:29.794]  Get Masters of Terror.
[00:54:30.315 --> 00:54:31.495]  Get my book, Descent to Tyranny.
[00:54:31.535 --> 00:54:34.677]  Get the other books and videos on 9-11 we carry at Infowars.com.
[00:54:35.077 --> 00:54:37.659]  We have to wake the people up about who carried it out now.
[00:54:37.679 --> 00:54:38.540]  They're going to keep doing it.
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:41.882]  Same people that bombed Oklahoma City that carried out 9-11.
[00:54:41.902 --> 00:54:45.003]  We've got to stop them before they really move against us.
[00:54:45.063 --> 00:54:52.268]  If you love your children, government minions listening right now, you'll wake up and check out what we're claiming and find out it's true and then join us in the fight.
[00:54:52.308 --> 00:54:54.109]  Go to Infowars.com to get the films.
[00:54:55.109 --> 00:54:57.750]  Or go to PrisonPlanet.tv to see them all online right now.
[00:54:58.690 --> 00:55:00.991]  Joe, where are you calling us from today, Joe?
[00:55:01.471 --> 00:55:02.671]  Calling from Milwaukee.
[00:55:03.291 --> 00:55:11.954]  And first I'd like to say hi and thank you for your courage and also for Mr. Sheen's courage because I know I'm going to have some repercussions for this.
[00:55:12.274 --> 00:55:20.536]  But I've been, for all practical purposes, duly elected as our city's spokesman to the nation.
[00:55:20.816 --> 00:55:24.337]  So our city, as a matter of fact, has an emergency.
[00:55:25.086 --> 00:55:26.686]  You need to speak up a little.
[00:55:27.127 --> 00:55:27.447]  Okay.
[00:55:29.067 --> 00:55:35.929]  There was a trial that happened here in the city and there was a man who was beaten rather badly.
[00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:41.491]  He is black and the officers that did it were white.
[00:55:43.051 --> 00:55:49.473]  It's not that unusual to happen here but the thing that was really bad
[00:55:50.342 --> 00:55:55.186]  ...was that an all-white jury acquitted the three officers that were being held accountable.
[00:55:55.666 --> 00:55:58.149]  There were 15 officers that were on the scene.
[00:55:58.749 --> 00:56:04.414]  There was a Hispanic officer that called for backup and basically ignored.
[00:56:05.635 --> 00:56:08.917]  There's also something else that happened just in the past week.
[00:56:09.058 --> 00:56:11.179]  This is an interesting story, but I don't even know the name.
[00:56:11.199 --> 00:56:12.180]  I don't even know about it.
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:15.323]  I'm just sitting here hearing about... His name is Frank Jude.
[00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:17.932]  And there wasn't a riot.
[00:56:18.052 --> 00:56:21.435]  There was a peaceful protest one week after the verdict came out.
[00:56:22.176 --> 00:56:25.799]  The police chief herself is at wit's end, I think.
[00:56:25.899 --> 00:56:28.862]  I think she's pulling her hair out that the officers were not...
[00:56:29.945 --> 00:56:41.790]  You know, the best thing for a discussion like this is for you to send me some info and maybe be a guest on the show, sir, because, I mean, we're just here... I mean, every five minutes there's a police brutality story I've got on my desk here.
[00:56:41.810 --> 00:56:51.254]  I mean, we've got the government saying we're about to be hit by nukes any day, and, you know, we're here with the dollar plunging, oil prices exploding, and, yes, I know about the police brutality.
[00:56:51.274 --> 00:56:58.457]  The general attitude that I've heard from all sections of the city are that it's nothing new.
[00:56:59.487 --> 00:57:05.531]  People, to their credit, have pretty much kept this calm down.
[00:57:05.571 --> 00:57:06.732]  Well, Joe, I'm going to let you go.
[00:57:06.792 --> 00:57:08.133]  Send me some info on it, okay?
[00:57:08.613 --> 00:57:09.293]  I appreciate it.
[00:57:09.333 --> 00:57:10.254]  Mark in Atlanta.
[00:57:10.594 --> 00:57:11.415]  Mark, you're on the air.
[00:57:11.455 --> 00:57:11.855]  Go ahead.
[00:57:11.875 --> 00:57:12.956]  Hey, bro.
[00:57:13.036 --> 00:57:13.976]  It's been a while.
[00:57:14.197 --> 00:57:15.397]  I've been trying to get through to you.
[00:57:15.477 --> 00:57:16.458]  I've got a number of things.
[00:57:16.538 --> 00:57:18.559]  I'll try and get to them in rapid succession.
[00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:22.722]  I spoke with Dr. Bowman Sr.
[00:57:22.982 --> 00:57:23.462]  this morning.
[00:57:23.482 --> 00:57:25.364]  His son, Rob Bowman Jr.,
[00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:29.062]  He's the kind of person I consider to be a friend.
[00:57:29.502 --> 00:57:34.986]  Okay, Dr. Bowman's the former head of the Star Wars program, coming out and saying 9-11's an inside job.
[00:57:35.627 --> 00:57:49.237]  Right, and his son, Rob Bowman Jr., used to be director of research at the so-called Christian Research Institute when he lost his job for refusing to ghostwrite material for the Pat Anser and Hank Hanegraaff.
[00:57:49.674 --> 00:57:52.056]  Also... Okay.
[00:57:52.116 --> 00:57:54.498]  It's like we're having private conversations here.
[00:57:54.518 --> 00:57:57.179]  I mean, callers, I'm not even mad at you, caller.
[00:57:57.239 --> 00:58:01.242]  It's just I don't even... If I don't know what you're talking about, the listeners aren't going to know.
[00:58:01.282 --> 00:58:06.026]  I mean, something about ghostwriting, Bowman's son... Right.
[00:58:06.226 --> 00:58:08.387]  Dr. Rob Bowman, Jr.
[00:58:09.328 --> 00:58:16.173]  used to be director of research at the... Basically, Hank Hanegraaff seized control...
[00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:22.543]  After Dr. Walter Martin, the founder, died unexpectedly... You know what I'm going to have to do?
[00:58:22.804 --> 00:58:26.026]  I'm going to have to... If you want to hold later, I want to take calls and get back to you.
[00:58:26.066 --> 00:58:30.288]  This is... This is... Well, I think the listeners know what we're dealing with here.
[00:58:30.568 --> 00:58:38.473]  I mean, these are all, like, really complex issues that haven't even been in the news, and I know nothing about them, and so it's getting pretty confusing.
[00:58:38.793 --> 00:58:39.734]  Pretty weird talk radio.
[00:58:41.761 --> 00:58:46.606]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:46.646 --> 00:58:46.946]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.986 --> 00:58:47.407]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.427 --> 00:58:48.268]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:02.860]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.621 --> 00:59:04.541]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.181 --> 00:59:08.842]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.363 --> 00:59:13.484]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.785 --> 00:59:28.889]  This just in, coming up in the third hour, we'll be talking to Wang Wen-Yai, a reporter for the Epoch Times, who admonished President Bush to stop Hu from persecuting the Falun Gong.
[00:59:29.829 --> 00:59:31.430]  She's on with us in the third hour.
[00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:34.911]  She speaks broken English, but it'll be a newsmaker.
[00:59:35.471 --> 00:59:36.931]  So we'll be doing that.
[00:59:37.251 --> 00:59:44.233]  Right now, Glenn Spencer in southern Arizona, right on the border, flying at around 1,000 feet, so his cell phone can stay connected.
[00:59:44.313 --> 00:59:45.853]  If he goes any higher, it'll cut out.
[00:59:46.273 --> 00:59:48.274]  And if it does cut out, we'll reconnect with him.
[00:59:48.294 --> 00:59:52.675]  Glenn Spencer, one of the preeminent researchers documenting the reconquista.
[00:59:53.488 --> 00:59:54.989]  He says California has fallen.
[00:59:55.009 --> 00:59:59.831]  He's moved to Arizona several years ago and is really one of the forerunners of the Minutemen.
[00:59:59.891 --> 01:00:06.494]  He's kind of the grandfather of some of the tactics the Minutemen use successfully today, and he's there, of course, working with them as well.
[01:00:06.854 --> 01:00:08.055]  He's in his aircraft right now.
[01:00:08.095 --> 01:00:10.496]  They also fly unmanned aerial vehicles or drones.
[01:00:10.996 --> 01:00:22.042]  But when Spencer joins us from his aircraft, sending live images back to AmericanPatrol.com and AmericanBorderPatrol.com, we have links to that up on InfoWars.com right now so you can watch these live video images.
[01:00:22.382 --> 01:00:24.983]  Glenn Spencer, I salute you, my Paul Revere.
[01:00:25.263 --> 01:00:30.486]  Well, Alex, we had a little change of plans because of the winds, severe winds.
[01:00:30.526 --> 01:00:32.267]  We flew an early morning mission.
[01:00:32.607 --> 01:00:33.167]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:00:33.187 --> 01:00:38.230]  What we're doing now is we're really playing back on AmericanBorderPatrol.com.
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.141]  On the camera page, the images we took earlier.
[01:00:41.721 --> 01:00:43.022]  So you can go up there and look at them.
[01:00:43.202 --> 01:00:44.362]  I'm sorry for misreporting.
[01:00:44.462 --> 01:00:47.183]  I was told right before you came on that you were in the air right now.
[01:00:47.663 --> 01:00:51.465]  No, I told your people about a half an hour ago that I had to stay on the ground.
[01:00:51.485 --> 01:00:53.646]  No, I know the network didn't tell me that, but that's okay.
[01:00:55.206 --> 01:00:55.766]  Go ahead.
[01:00:55.807 --> 01:00:57.947]  We have done it, but we've had severe winds down here.
[01:00:58.027 --> 01:00:58.528]  No, fantastic.
[01:00:58.548 --> 01:00:59.268]  You're doing a great job.
[01:00:59.288 --> 01:01:00.168]  I don't even care about that.
[01:01:00.648 --> 01:01:02.009]  So you did do a mission this morning.
[01:01:02.029 --> 01:01:02.589]  What did you see?
[01:01:03.029 --> 01:01:06.130]  Well, if you go on American Border Patrol.com,
[01:01:08.184 --> 01:01:17.411]  You will see just an apprehension of 15 illegal aliens right down by the river that's very close to our headquarters right here that we tracked and reported.
[01:01:18.172 --> 01:01:20.093]  You'll see two vehicles.
[01:01:21.094 --> 01:01:23.436]  We're flying and orbiting around them right now.
[01:01:23.456 --> 01:01:26.738]  You'll see 15 illegal aliens sitting on the ground right there.
[01:01:27.919 --> 01:01:33.003]  Later on in this tape, you'll see that we tracked them over to the NACO station where they unloaded them.
[01:01:33.601 --> 01:01:36.682]  We then tracked them into Naco.
[01:01:37.042 --> 01:01:42.583]  Then we spotted a van, what we call the San Pedro shuttle.
[01:01:42.603 --> 01:01:48.125]  It's a smuggler's van leaving Naco, no doubt loaded with more people to try it again.
[01:01:48.205 --> 01:01:49.445]  It's a revolving door.
[01:01:50.025 --> 01:01:51.165]  They arrest these people.
[01:01:51.205 --> 01:01:52.826]  You can see them on the videotape.
[01:01:53.286 --> 01:01:57.767]  They apprehend them, take them to the Border Patrol headquarters, unload them,
[01:01:58.653 --> 01:02:01.435]  Process them, take them into Mexico, and they come right back.
[01:02:01.495 --> 01:02:03.757]  And they keep trying until they do it, and they always do it.
[01:02:04.617 --> 01:02:07.019]  Now, this morning, we also got an alert.
[01:02:07.719 --> 01:02:13.543]  We tracked a load vehicle where they had made it way past the Border Patrol, jumped into a load vehicle.
[01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:16.345]  The Border Patrol never stopped it.
[01:02:16.606 --> 01:02:19.908]  Nobody was close enough, and it's now on the way to your town.
[01:02:19.968 --> 01:02:22.189]  They got through, as they usually do.
[01:02:22.810 --> 01:02:24.351]  We tracked that, okay?
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:30.643]  We've tracked them running up through the San Pedro River.
[01:02:30.663 --> 01:02:39.328]  The Border Patrol has spread so thin that there's no hope that we'll ever be able to stop this continuing to do what we are doing now.
[01:02:39.828 --> 01:02:41.009]  And we will continue.
[01:02:41.029 --> 01:02:44.271]  The President of the United States has sold us down the river.
[01:02:45.792 --> 01:02:48.955]  Meanwhile, they have some paltry 1,000 arrested.
[01:02:49.015 --> 01:02:49.755]  That's .00004.
[01:02:50.956 --> 01:02:59.183]  If they arrested 1,000 a day for a year, that would be less than 1% of the illegal aliens in this country.
[01:02:59.223 --> 01:03:00.364]  It's nothing but theatrics.
[01:03:00.924 --> 01:03:01.645]  That is correct.
[01:03:02.085 --> 01:03:03.066]  That's all it was.
[01:03:03.326 --> 01:03:10.351]  The president just appeared in Irvine, California, and reiterated his intent.
[01:03:11.692 --> 01:03:13.694]  The American people, most of them,
[01:03:14.107 --> 01:03:23.314]  I really have no idea that he is advocating the utter destruction of the United States of America.
[01:03:23.334 --> 01:03:26.517]  There is no other way to put it.
[01:03:26.677 --> 01:03:30.640]  It is the utter destruction of our nation.
[01:03:31.721 --> 01:03:35.944]  And I just cannot believe...
[01:03:39.017 --> 01:03:41.239]  Here's Representative King from New York.
[01:03:41.259 --> 01:03:42.720]  Tell you what, stay there, Glenn Spencer.
[01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:43.720]  Give us a report on it.
[01:03:44.261 --> 01:03:50.365]  On the other side, what you think of the last four weeks of demonstrating, where it's all going.
[01:03:50.425 --> 01:03:51.445]  Stay with us.
[01:03:53.667 --> 01:03:56.509]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:58.532]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:03:58.752 --> 01:04:04.480]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:10.027]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:04:10.328 --> 01:04:12.090]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order of Problems...
[01:04:13.531 --> 01:04:18.414]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[01:04:18.674 --> 01:04:23.316]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:04:23.416 --> 01:04:29.660]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:31.521]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[01:04:32.001 --> 01:04:34.083]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny today.
[01:04:34.163 --> 01:04:37.546]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:04:37.846 --> 01:04:39.808]  That's 1-888-253-3139.

[01:04:45.813 --> 01:04:47.795]  You see big brothers afraid of this documentary.
[01:04:48.055 --> 01:04:49.537]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:04:49.737 --> 01:04:51.819]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:04:53.035 --> 01:05:03.783]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:05:03.943 --> 01:05:11.508]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:05:11.769 --> 01:05:14.931]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:05:15.071 --> 01:05:15.472]  We're good to go.
[01:05:33.732 --> 01:05:39.697]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:05:39.917 --> 01:05:43.701]  Get the Berkey Light, a transparent water filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:05:53.692 --> 01:05:54.532]  Come on, Bill.
[01:05:54.732 --> 01:05:56.553]  Two weeks ago, you were riding the bicycle.
[01:05:56.753 --> 01:05:59.914]  And today, you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[01:06:00.254 --> 01:06:00.814]  What did you do?
[01:06:00.914 --> 01:06:01.734]  Rob Bill Gates?
[01:06:01.834 --> 01:06:03.815]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[01:06:04.095 --> 01:06:09.616]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:06:09.896 --> 01:06:16.158]  That's where I learned how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[01:06:16.478 --> 01:06:18.698]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[01:06:18.998 --> 01:06:21.859]  And get this, they guarantee my success in writing.
[01:06:22.359 --> 01:06:25.800]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week.
[01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:26.540]  Whoa.
[01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:28.061]  What was that website again?
[01:06:28.141 --> 01:06:31.622]  It's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[01:06:31.922 --> 01:06:33.042]  Now write this down, John.
[01:06:33.162 --> 01:06:37.463]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[01:06:37.623 --> 01:06:38.203]  Thanks, Bill.
[01:06:38.483 --> 01:06:39.664]  I'm going there right now.
[01:06:40.084 --> 01:06:40.724]  Check, please.
[01:06:42.456 --> 01:06:43.978]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[01:06:44.438 --> 01:06:45.039]  Sure, John.
[01:06:45.259 --> 01:06:49.624]  Don't forget, it's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[01:06:49.944 --> 01:06:51.605]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[01:06:51.806 --> 01:06:52.126]  Deal.
[01:06:52.606 --> 01:06:57.631]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.012 --> 01:07:00.334]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:00.354 --> 01:07:05.780]  There's been a change of plans.
[01:07:07.106 --> 01:07:16.829]  Wayne Winyai, a reporter for the Epoch Times, who last week confronted Lord Bush and Lord Who, will be joining us in about 25 minutes when Mr. Spencer leaves us.
[01:07:18.129 --> 01:07:18.929]  So that's coming up.
[01:07:18.949 --> 01:07:20.170]  You'll want to stay with us for that.
[01:07:21.330 --> 01:07:24.971]  Learn about the organ harvesting, the mass murdering, all of it.
[01:07:25.952 --> 01:07:31.733]  Going back to Glenn Spencer, for those who don't understand what's going on here, I would love to have 25 million Chinese like me
[01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:37.371]  Dr. Wang Wen-Yai.
[01:07:38.592 --> 01:07:52.503]  I would love to have 25 million of the type of farmers that when the communist Chinese government, we have video of it, marches up with machine guns, they fight back with hoes, and are mowed down, and in many cases are defeating the Chinese police and military.
[01:07:53.624 --> 01:07:56.466]  In America, when they take our private property, we just lay down and let them do it.
[01:07:58.548 --> 01:08:04.413]  But we have 20 plus million illegal aliens from Latin America, mainly Mexico, another 5 million from other countries.
[01:08:05.396 --> 01:08:07.658]  So 25 million to 30 million, that's conservative.
[01:08:09.139 --> 01:08:12.221]  Not the 14 million, now they're going, well, maybe it's 20 million.
[01:08:12.261 --> 01:08:13.843]  No, it's above that that are here.
[01:08:14.183 --> 01:08:29.795]  They run around with Mexican, Nicaraguan, El Salvadoran, Guatemalan, Chilean, Brazilian flags, Haitian flags, whatever, saying this is Mexico, predominantly, and saying we need to implement the plan of San Diego.
[01:08:29.815 --> 01:08:33.918]  The UT Chicano Studies professor, again, two weeks ago, said in a speech,
[01:08:34.841 --> 01:08:37.023]  That all gringos must be killed.
[01:08:37.063 --> 01:08:38.965]  Now it's not just white males 16 and older.
[01:08:39.365 --> 01:08:45.351]  And Glenn Spencer this morning flew another mission, bad weather he had to land, and saw the illegal aliens being brought in, being bussed.
[01:08:45.431 --> 01:08:49.275]  Border Patrol can and won't and can't do anything.
[01:08:49.855 --> 01:08:52.738]  Meanwhile, Bush is grandstanding with theater, arresting, what, 1,200.
[01:08:52.778 --> 01:08:52.998]  That's 0.00004%.
[01:08:53.038 --> 01:08:53.499]  1,000 arrested a day.
[01:08:59.938 --> 01:09:02.839]  For a year, it would be less than 1% of the illegal aliens.
[01:09:02.879 --> 01:09:04.619]  That's how many we're talking about.
[01:09:04.639 --> 01:09:09.500]  And Chertop, on the heels of that, said, Mexican troop incursions are exaggerated and aren't a problem.
[01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:13.981]  Dead Forest Service, dead FBI, dead police, dead sheriff's deputies.
[01:09:14.021 --> 01:09:15.401]  I've interviewed the sheriffs in Texas.
[01:09:15.681 --> 01:09:23.523]  When the Mexican troops come onto our country's property and aim machine guns at them, when our police are taking marijuana and cocaine out of a dump truck.
[01:09:24.363 --> 01:09:26.663]  Okay, we had troops putting police at gunpoint.
[01:09:27.303 --> 01:09:29.704]  Now, if Al-Qaeda did that, you'd never hear the end of it.
[01:09:30.484 --> 01:09:32.045]  But we hear, oh, the war on terror.
[01:09:32.065 --> 01:09:32.845]  Give up all your rights.
[01:09:32.865 --> 01:09:38.967]  We've got to have military checkpoints in New York and Miami and search everybody and national ID cards.
[01:09:39.248 --> 01:09:41.989]  And Hillary wants open borders, calling it a border solution.
[01:09:42.209 --> 01:09:43.309]  They're getting very deceptive.
[01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:48.071]  Glenn Spencer, I want to go through the marches, the demonstrations, the rallies, the riots.
[01:09:48.131 --> 01:09:49.732]  I've seen video of racial attacks.
[01:09:49.772 --> 01:09:50.932]  The media covers that up.
[01:09:51.372 --> 01:09:53.353]  Of course, we broke the news.
[01:09:53.373 --> 01:09:57.075]  It was in the Dallas Morning News, but nobody picked up on it back in December 25th.
[01:09:58.636 --> 01:10:04.319]  That Fox and Bush hired a big PR firm they've used in the past to stage all of this, and this is all staged.
[01:10:04.579 --> 01:10:06.920]  Give me your take on my comments and then add your comments.
[01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:23.507]  Well, in 1994, when we were pressing for Proposition 187 in California that cut off services to illegal aliens, 150,000 people marched through Los Angeles to protest this before the election.
[01:10:24.247 --> 01:10:26.048]  And they were carrying Mexican flags.
[01:10:27.084 --> 01:10:30.287]  Now we have the Sensenbrenner Bill, H.R.
[01:10:30.307 --> 01:10:34.350]  4437, and passed by the House of Representatives, and now over in the Senate.
[01:10:35.151 --> 01:10:45.499]  And this time, upward to 700,000 people marched through downtown Los Angeles and many other towns, carrying Mexican flags.
[01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:53.206]  Now, if you go fast forward this, if they give these... A guest worker program is an amnesty.
[01:10:53.406 --> 01:10:54.547]  There's no question about that.
[01:10:55.262 --> 01:11:00.504]  If they give these people amnesty, I will tell you, that's over.
[01:11:01.105 --> 01:11:03.706]  Kiss your butt goodbye.
[01:11:04.986 --> 01:11:06.107]  That's all there is to it.
[01:11:07.627 --> 01:11:12.730]  Representative King from New York said, I've been in politics for over 30 years, and there can be a place for politics.
[01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:18.912]  But this is an issue of life and death, and the American way of life.
[01:11:18.932 --> 01:11:22.274]  This is a highly respected member of Congress.
[01:11:22.294 --> 01:11:22.934]  That's what it is.
[01:11:23.877 --> 01:11:31.823]  This is life and death of this nation that is going to be debated in the next two weeks in the Senate of the United States.
[01:11:31.843 --> 01:11:33.605]  And right now they're trying to kill us.
[01:11:33.625 --> 01:11:46.535]  And I will tell you, and you saw it, you saw the flags, you saw them out at the high school where they raised the Mexican flag and underneath that, at Montebello High School, the American flag upside down.
[01:11:47.936 --> 01:11:49.658]  That's exactly where we're headed.
[01:11:50.994 --> 01:11:54.217]  And when they say get out of this continent, they mean it.
[01:11:55.638 --> 01:11:57.379]  One continent, one culture.
[01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:03.764]  And we're going to be overwhelmed and driven out of North America.
[01:12:03.784 --> 01:12:07.967]  We'll probably end up on reservations for Anglos.
[01:12:08.688 --> 01:12:09.569]  Anglo reservations.
[01:12:09.589 --> 01:12:13.432]  They're going to call them, you know, what's good for the goose is good for the gander.
[01:12:13.472 --> 01:12:15.533]  We'll give you some place where you can stay.
[01:12:15.553 --> 01:12:18.776]  But you're going to have to stay there and get permission to leave.
[01:12:19.744 --> 01:12:22.546]  If you don't think that's happening, you've got another thing coming.
[01:12:23.307 --> 01:12:25.889]  Well, I've already talked to a lot of my friends that live in L.A.
[01:12:25.969 --> 01:12:33.735]  who are chefs, agreed chefs, and they say, they're told, and these are white owners, look, our cooking crew doesn't want gringos.
[01:12:34.115 --> 01:12:35.336]  You can't communicate with them.
[01:12:35.356 --> 01:12:35.897]  You're fired.
[01:12:36.658 --> 01:12:37.198]  That's correct.
[01:12:38.010 --> 01:12:41.151]  And that's going to happen over and over and over again in this country.
[01:12:41.171 --> 01:12:43.312]  Well, that's what the don't buy from the gringo.
[01:12:43.653 --> 01:12:48.535]  It's not just a boycott or a don't go to work that they've been calling for on May Day last week.
[01:12:48.615 --> 01:12:53.097]  I mean, again, Hispanic Americans are very patriotic, aren't like this.
[01:12:53.137 --> 01:12:57.419]  But this is the illegal aliens with the Spanish media predominantly owned by big U.S.
[01:12:57.459 --> 01:12:58.039]  corporations.
[01:12:58.099 --> 01:13:00.780]  Bottom line, they want the Pan-American Union.
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:03.442]  They want to break America up, merge us with Latin America.
[01:13:03.782 --> 01:13:06.043]  And they have brought in a foreign political force.
[01:13:06.483 --> 01:13:09.884]  That is protected and shielded by our media and babied by our media.
[01:13:10.184 --> 01:13:12.245]  They've brought them here with welfare and everything else.
[01:13:12.345 --> 01:13:14.405]  Of course, the guest worker program is unlimited.
[01:13:14.706 --> 01:13:16.546]  Whoever's here for six years is legalized.
[01:13:16.586 --> 01:13:20.967]  It lets them bring in unlimited legal, unskilled, and skilled.
[01:13:21.268 --> 01:13:22.248]  Makes it all legal.
[01:13:22.828 --> 01:13:26.609]  And I want to go back to Gutierrez and others.
[01:13:26.669 --> 01:13:31.471]  I mean, am I exaggerating that these professors routinely say that we all must die?
[01:13:32.831 --> 01:13:34.371]  No, they believe that.
[01:13:34.812 --> 01:13:35.912]  And they do say it.
[01:13:37.398 --> 01:13:40.820]  But let's, you know, these people... But then we're racist.
[01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:42.741]  We're racist because we don't want to die.
[01:13:43.101 --> 01:13:44.042]  But let's listen.
[01:13:44.062 --> 01:13:49.384]  Here is this guy, David Kivitt, and this was written in the Deseret Morning News.
[01:13:50.605 --> 01:13:56.588]  Here he was, a Harvard graduate, a member of the State Department, right?
[01:13:56.988 --> 01:13:59.069]  Working in Mexico 20 years ago.
[01:13:59.089 --> 01:14:06.093]  And he was writing the State Department as a diplomat, warning them
[01:14:07.304 --> 01:14:19.567]  That he said that the Mexican government was advancing illegal immigration as part of a... to retake the American Southwest.
[01:14:20.408 --> 01:14:24.109]  And this is written up, and this guy is saying, this is what is going on.
[01:14:24.409 --> 01:14:26.529]  He warned them 20 years ago.
[01:14:26.549 --> 01:14:29.550]  20 years ago, and he's now come public.
[01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:32.211]  He said, you have to understand that's what's happening.
[01:14:33.591 --> 01:14:35.072]  So this is not a drill.
[01:14:35.717 --> 01:14:37.999]  This is not something that's theoretical.
[01:14:38.319 --> 01:14:39.540]  This is right now.
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:47.166]  The President of the United States is going to debate whether or not we're going to sacrifice the Southwest to Mexico.
[01:14:47.266 --> 01:14:52.750]  Well, I'll tell you, Glenn Spencer, what's really chilling is that my wife speaks Spanish and reads Spanish.
[01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:54.191]  We've lived in Spain for many years.
[01:14:55.332 --> 01:14:59.835]  And we can hear on talk radio these amnesty groups.
[01:15:00.056 --> 01:15:01.717]  They also call them asylum groups.
[01:15:02.641 --> 01:15:03.142]  We're good to go.
[01:15:17.595 --> 01:15:18.955]  It's the slick propaganda.
[01:15:18.975 --> 01:15:26.937]  Then you go to their very website, and in Spanish it says, we're taking over, plan of San Diego, ha ha ha, we're going to get the gringos.
[01:15:26.997 --> 01:15:34.519]  So they know that the gringo can't read or understand Spanish, and so it's a perfect takeover because it's in another language.
[01:15:34.659 --> 01:15:35.199]  That's correct.
[01:15:35.219 --> 01:15:40.280]  Now, remember they had these big demonstrations, they're carrying the Mexican flags, and then there was an outrage.
[01:15:40.945 --> 01:15:42.186]  The next week, what happened?
[01:15:42.326 --> 01:15:49.268]  Huge trucks with the big PR firms paid for by Fox and Bush, confirmed, serving out thousands of American flags.
[01:15:49.708 --> 01:15:51.109]  But you have to look at what happened.
[01:15:51.129 --> 01:15:55.351]  You had a couple hundred thousand people all wearing white shirts, right?
[01:15:56.091 --> 01:15:59.512]  They were wearing white shirts and carrying American flags.
[01:15:59.812 --> 01:16:04.214]  Now, that is called a uniform and carrying a flag that they're told to carry.
[01:16:04.874 --> 01:16:08.776]  They followed orders just like an army.
[01:16:09.833 --> 01:16:13.457]  They were told to wear a white shirt and carry the American flag, and they did it.
[01:16:14.598 --> 01:16:16.860]  That was an army you were looking at there.
[01:16:18.421 --> 01:16:20.023]  Now, again, Glenn, I agree.
[01:16:20.143 --> 01:16:21.464]  Washington, great point you make.
[01:16:21.905 --> 01:16:24.487]  Washington knows this and wants to break up the U.S.
[01:16:24.507 --> 01:16:25.388]  The corporations want to.
[01:16:25.408 --> 01:16:25.908]  That's correct.
[01:16:26.048 --> 01:16:31.674]  This is their own rent-a-mob, their $25 to $30 million rent-a-mob that will do whatever they're told whenever they're told.
[01:16:31.734 --> 01:16:32.695]  And in Spanish.
[01:16:33.488 --> 01:16:38.790]  You had all of the Spanish-language radio stations and TV stations in Los Angeles.
[01:16:39.071 --> 01:16:47.054]  You had the mayor of Los Angeles, the city council, all of the organizations out there beating the drum, getting people out to demonstrate.
[01:16:47.254 --> 01:16:48.795]  This is a revolution.
[01:16:49.255 --> 01:16:51.236]  This is pre-Civil War II.
[01:16:51.516 --> 01:16:57.599]  By the way, they have here in Austin big banners that said, violent revolution must be enacted.
[01:16:58.314 --> 01:16:59.254]  Well, it's going to happen.
[01:17:00.014 --> 01:17:02.135]  You said that five years ago when you still lived in L.A.
[01:17:02.155 --> 01:17:03.435]  because you were listening to these people.
[01:17:03.695 --> 01:17:05.816]  You said they'd start killing Border Patrol and military.
[01:17:05.856 --> 01:17:06.556]  They've done that.
[01:17:06.636 --> 01:17:09.416]  No, no, I said we were going to have a war over this thing.
[01:17:09.556 --> 01:17:10.177]  You said that.
[01:17:10.217 --> 01:17:11.317]  Now, I want to hear your prediction.
[01:17:11.357 --> 01:17:12.217]  When is it going to happen?
[01:17:12.277 --> 01:17:16.118]  Well, I don't know exactly when it could happen, but it could happen at any moment.
[01:17:16.678 --> 01:17:18.358]  All you have, everything is set up.
[01:17:19.058 --> 01:17:26.220]  Now, if the House of Representatives doesn't go along with an amnesty program, you're going to have a collision course.
[01:17:26.770 --> 01:17:33.436]  If they do go along with an amnesty program, you're on a collision course because the American people are going to rise up and put a stop to it.
[01:17:33.576 --> 01:17:41.342]  It's just the Auslanders, the invaders, who are saying we're Auslanders, they are going to have just a bigger force.
[01:17:41.382 --> 01:17:43.564]  So we need to go ahead and have the collision now.
[01:17:44.284 --> 01:17:50.509]  Well, I think we're almost asymptotic to 2008, where the probability is going to approach 100% by 2008.
[01:17:56.661 --> 01:17:57.561]  In the next two years.
[01:17:57.901 --> 01:18:00.082]  We could have it happen at any time.
[01:18:01.623 --> 01:18:03.243]  We have been set up for this.
[01:18:04.024 --> 01:18:05.664]  This was done deliberately.
[01:18:05.684 --> 01:18:15.147]  The Ford Foundations of the world that took over the Border Patrol under Bill Clinton and stopped Interior Enforcement and decimated the Border Patrol.
[01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:18.721]  This is what's going on.
[01:18:18.761 --> 01:18:22.765]  Well, Bock was one of the head guys at the Border Patrol, and he was a former Ford Foundation member.
[01:18:22.785 --> 01:18:24.286]  Robert Bock set us up.
[01:18:24.647 --> 01:18:25.848]  He and Doris Meisner.
[01:18:25.888 --> 01:18:29.591]  Doris Meisner ran the immigration service that included the Border Patrol.
[01:18:30.172 --> 01:18:31.533]  What did she just do?
[01:18:32.114 --> 01:18:32.995]  Well, look, it's simple.
[01:18:33.015 --> 01:18:33.575]  We've got to break.
[01:18:33.595 --> 01:18:33.956]  We've got to break.
[01:18:33.976 --> 01:18:35.217]  Glenn, I want to hear about it on the other side.
[01:18:35.237 --> 01:18:35.697]  It's simple.
[01:18:36.838 --> 01:18:39.301]  They knew the American people wouldn't put up with the New World Order.
[01:18:39.341 --> 01:18:42.744]  They brought in a foreign group, geared them up with an ideology...
[01:18:43.653 --> 01:18:45.616]  And they've got them like a knife to the throat of this country.
[01:18:45.636 --> 01:18:46.458]  And they're going to use it.
[01:18:46.838 --> 01:18:48.120]  They're going to slit this country's throat.
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:49.101]  Right in front of all of you.
[01:18:49.522 --> 01:18:51.265]  And you're going to love it when George Bush does it.
[01:18:55.151 --> 01:18:56.793]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:57.374 --> 01:18:59.117]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:00.293 --> 01:19:08.196]  The best kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:08.396 --> 01:19:11.037]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed, Inc.'
[01:19:11.017 --> 01:19:12.438]  's patented methodology.

[01:20:46.481 --> 01:20:55.383]  The war on terrorism.
[01:20:55.703 --> 01:20:58.484]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:20:58.764 --> 01:21:02.905]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:21:03.345 --> 01:21:04.165]  So what do you do?
[01:21:04.485 --> 01:21:09.046]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:21:09.546 --> 01:21:10.127]  We're good to go.
[01:21:34.386 --> 01:21:36.289]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:21:52.805 --> 01:21:56.128]  And now a word from Dr. Patricia Margaitis from Stem Enhance.
[01:21:56.548 --> 01:22:00.711]  I want to first thank the wonderful GCN listeners for supporting Stem Enhance.
[01:22:01.231 --> 01:22:08.637]  Now know that your own stem cells are your body's maintenance group, and Stem Enhance makes sure that more of them show up for work every day.
[01:22:09.042 --> 01:22:13.043]  The truth is, the more stem cells you have in your bloodstream, the greater your health.
[01:22:13.423 --> 01:22:26.847]  If you believe there is something more for you, have a strong work ethic, and wish to participate in the monumental increase in the cause for natural health while gaining financial independence and monthly cash flow, then you are the right person.
[01:22:27.267 --> 01:22:30.648]  I personally invite you to join me as a distributor of Stem Enhancer.
[01:22:31.050 --> 01:22:35.312]  I am committed to personally make sure you receive the tools needed to succeed.
[01:22:35.672 --> 01:22:38.593]  Remember, the first rule of success, you must show up.
[01:22:38.733 --> 01:22:42.034]  Call me, Dr. Patricia Margitis at 860-567-7744.
[01:22:42.094 --> 01:22:43.575]  That number again, 860-567-7744.
[01:23:02.966 --> 01:23:13.114]  We've got to get Glenn Spencer up in the near future for a longer segment so we can take some calls.
[01:23:13.154 --> 01:23:16.056]  But Glenn, here in the last five minutes, we've got left with you today.
[01:23:19.298 --> 01:23:24.442]  How do the Lodi Conquistas, they run around saying all gringos are racist and whine and cry.
[01:23:24.482 --> 01:23:27.224]  Meanwhile, they adore publications and leaders.
[01:23:27.264 --> 01:23:30.707]  I mean, big leaders saying not just force gringo out, but kill gringo.
[01:23:31.579 --> 01:23:34.380]  And then Gringo and many others just sit here with our mouths hanging open.
[01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:36.882]  Meanwhile, our government supports all of this, Glenn.
[01:23:37.762 --> 01:23:39.483]  I wrote about this 20 years ago.
[01:23:39.503 --> 01:23:43.765]  I was in the Pentagon studying the Vietnam War for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[01:23:43.805 --> 01:23:46.026]  I was on a special task force.
[01:23:46.266 --> 01:23:53.210]  And 20 years ago, I wrote a letter in the Daily Times that I said, it's a question of whether the Mexicans want this land more than we want to keep it.
[01:23:53.850 --> 01:23:56.151]  And it's really up to the American people.
[01:23:56.191 --> 01:23:57.352]  And right now, they're winning.
[01:23:58.126 --> 01:24:01.647]  Why do they want this to be Mexico?
[01:24:01.707 --> 01:24:02.548]  Mexico's a hellhole.
[01:24:02.568 --> 01:24:04.788]  That's correct, but the Americans are not fighting back.
[01:24:05.409 --> 01:24:07.309]  For the most part, they're passive.
[01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:09.730]  They're sitting back and allowing it to happen.
[01:24:10.410 --> 01:24:11.751]  When we have rallies, we get 300.
[01:24:12.011 --> 01:24:14.392]  When they have rallies, they have 300,000.
[01:24:14.632 --> 01:24:25.595]  Yeah, but if the national media promoted for three months and told Americans it was okay to demonstrate... I'm just telling you, right now, it looks very, very bad.
[01:24:26.016 --> 01:24:26.816]  And the reason is...
[01:24:27.475 --> 01:24:29.736]  We have no resistance.
[01:24:30.037 --> 01:24:33.058]  There's no real resistance to this takeover.
[01:24:33.258 --> 01:24:37.081]  Well, that's my point, is Americans are these sweet little sappy creatures.
[01:24:38.081 --> 01:24:41.143]  Why do the Lorican Kistas hate Americans so much?
[01:24:42.724 --> 01:24:44.785]  Well, there's a lot of reasons for that.
[01:24:45.225 --> 01:24:47.727]  They've been taught that since childhood in Mexico.
[01:24:48.753 --> 01:24:50.014]  That we stole their land.
[01:24:50.074 --> 01:24:51.975]  And that's why they're coming up to take it back.
[01:24:52.055 --> 01:24:54.176]  We've been taught mush.
[01:24:54.216 --> 01:24:57.958]  Our heads have been filled with mush since childhood.
[01:24:58.378 --> 01:25:00.340]  And we're set up to be taken over.
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:00.820]  That's all.
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:03.401]  But there's a final equation in this.
[01:25:03.821 --> 01:25:06.343]  Our government, both Democratic and Republican, loves it.
[01:25:07.163 --> 01:25:07.684]  They love it.
[01:25:08.144 --> 01:25:10.805]  So right now, I don't think the future looks very good.
[01:25:10.905 --> 01:25:12.606]  I'm not discouraged.
[01:25:13.367 --> 01:25:14.507]  I'm very concerned.
[01:25:14.607 --> 01:25:15.688]  It doesn't look good for us.
[01:25:16.889 --> 01:25:19.691]  But there is good news in that people are waking up like never before.
[01:25:19.711 --> 01:25:23.513]  Well, they're going to have to go a lot farther than they are right now.
[01:25:23.533 --> 01:25:25.554]  They're going to have to go a lot farther.
[01:25:26.335 --> 01:25:32.018]  Because we have a long road to hoe in order to put a stop to this.
[01:25:32.038 --> 01:25:34.840]  And right now they have a freight train going for them.
[01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:40.844]  What about getting sheriffs in a ring all across the border, getting our sheriffs elected?
[01:25:41.773 --> 01:25:52.082]  And I don't care what color they are, as long as they're pro-America, right along the border, and having them deputize the citizenry, having tax increases for emergency funding.
[01:25:52.182 --> 01:25:55.265]  If you can get them to do it, that's a great idea.
[01:25:55.285 --> 01:25:57.747]  I hope that they can take the initiative.
[01:25:57.767 --> 01:26:01.950]  There are a lot of sheriffs along the border that are joining the coalition, and they're speaking out.
[01:26:02.791 --> 01:26:09.677]  But we're doing everything we can, but the American people at the grassroots level
[01:26:10.649 --> 01:26:15.302]  They'd better wake up, because unless they get off their butts...
[01:26:16.092 --> 01:26:17.712]  They're about to get their butts kicked.
[01:26:17.752 --> 01:26:25.314]  Well, I mean, let's say we've got, you know, and most of the sheriffs I've talked to on the border, doesn't matter if their name is Gonzalez or Jones, they know what's going on.
[01:26:25.334 --> 01:26:25.734]  It doesn't matter.
[01:26:25.774 --> 01:26:28.655]  They all know what's going on, and they've joined together.
[01:26:28.955 --> 01:26:29.735]  But that's what I'm saying.
[01:26:29.755 --> 01:26:33.576]  What we need to do is go in, fund them, support them.
[01:26:33.596 --> 01:26:38.396]  We're getting a good sheriff, get them removed in an election, and have them go from 30 deputies to 500.
[01:26:39.397 --> 01:26:42.097]  That's very inexpensive, folks, tax-wise.
[01:26:42.297 --> 01:26:43.257]  Militarize them.
[01:26:43.538 --> 01:26:44.858]  That's constitutional.
[01:26:45.138 --> 01:26:45.798]  That's what we need to do.
[01:26:46.812 --> 01:26:50.295]  Well, this border is a very complicated thing.
[01:26:51.016 --> 01:26:52.557]  I fly it almost every day.
[01:26:53.278 --> 01:26:56.781]  There are millions of places to hide and to cross.
[01:26:57.781 --> 01:27:05.168]  And the amount of manpower that it would take to seal this border is just incredible.
[01:27:05.408 --> 01:27:08.851]  You need a physical barrier like they have in San Diego.
[01:27:09.494 --> 01:27:13.077]  If we put that up, they cut illegal immigration in that area by 95%.
[01:27:13.258 --> 01:27:20.164]  So we need double row of fences and then have machine gun nests every mile.
[01:27:20.224 --> 01:27:22.246]  Well, you don't even need that.
[01:27:22.286 --> 01:27:26.330]  They cut it by 95% by putting in this period.
[01:27:26.350 --> 01:27:26.971]  We don't need that?
[01:27:26.991 --> 01:27:28.012]  They're going to come cut through it.
[01:27:28.032 --> 01:27:28.992]  They're going to bulldoze through it.
[01:27:29.013 --> 01:27:29.493]  No, they're not.
[01:27:29.513 --> 01:27:30.814]  They haven't been able to do it.
[01:27:30.834 --> 01:27:32.676]  Go down to San Diego and look.
[01:27:32.696 --> 01:27:34.678]  The experience is that they haven't done it.
[01:27:35.672 --> 01:27:36.272]  They cut it by 95%.
[01:27:37.753 --> 01:27:42.835]  What do you think of Hillary with her ridiculous thing about a virtual fence?
[01:27:42.855 --> 01:27:43.936]  That's the same thing Bush wants.
[01:27:44.336 --> 01:27:46.517]  It is insane.
[01:27:46.537 --> 01:27:52.640]  I just issued a report to Congress on a DVD called The Border Patrol, How It Works and Why It Doesn't.
[01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:57.902]  It's a detailed, molecular look on exactly how the Border Patrol does its job.
[01:27:58.022 --> 01:27:59.843]  Can our listeners get a copy of that from you?
[01:28:00.538 --> 01:28:00.939]  I can't.
[01:28:00.999 --> 01:28:10.769]  It's only for official use, only for elected officials at the federal level, because to release it to the public would jeopardize our national security.
[01:28:11.069 --> 01:28:11.670]  Oh, really?
[01:28:12.591 --> 01:28:14.253]  But you do have other films people can get from you?
[01:28:14.273 --> 01:28:14.813]  Yes, yes.
[01:28:14.853 --> 01:28:17.756]  But this one, it really goes and shows exactly.
[01:28:17.796 --> 01:28:21.080]  If a terrorist got a hold of this, he'd know exactly.
[01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:22.161]  They already know, but I mean...
[01:28:22.717 --> 01:28:25.238]  More of them would know how to defeat our border security.
[01:28:25.258 --> 01:28:25.879]  All right.
[01:28:25.919 --> 01:28:26.979]  Give out your website, Glenn.
[01:28:27.199 --> 01:28:30.681]  Americanpatrol.com and Americanborderpatrol.com.
[01:28:30.881 --> 01:28:31.782]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:28:31.822 --> 01:28:32.402]  Thank you.
[01:28:32.702 --> 01:28:33.803]  Thanks for your valiant efforts.
[01:28:34.043 --> 01:28:34.363]  Bye-bye.
[01:28:35.724 --> 01:28:36.404]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:36.424 --> 01:28:37.365]  We're scheduled.
[01:28:37.425 --> 01:28:42.667]  We have the just amazing lady who stood up to the butcher of Beijing.
[01:28:43.107 --> 01:28:44.048]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.488 --> 01:28:46.109]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.029 --> 01:28:49.711]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.374 --> 01:29:00.241]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[01:29:00.401 --> 01:29:13.295]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[01:29:13.575 --> 01:29:15.315]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[01:29:15.455 --> 01:29:18.936]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[01:29:19.196 --> 01:29:22.977]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[01:29:23.237 --> 01:29:28.219]  Whatever it is you seek, Zango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[01:29:28.479 --> 01:29:30.179]  So take matters into your own hands.
[01:29:30.459 --> 01:29:34.440]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:36.501]  Zango is what you are looking for.
[01:29:36.521 --> 01:29:39.281]  Find out more by calling 888-203-6633 or visit MangosteenMarkets.com
[01:29:53.169 --> 01:30:00.694]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey light LED system.
[01:30:00.974 --> 01:30:11.882]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:30:12.122 --> 01:30:12.543]  We're good to go.
[01:30:12.643 --> 01:30:12.803]  I think?
[01:30:28.619 --> 01:30:29.120]  That's right.
[01:30:29.300 --> 01:30:36.406]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:30:36.706 --> 01:30:45.134]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:30:54.335 --> 01:30:56.657]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:30:56.917 --> 01:30:58.959]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:30:59.099 --> 01:31:06.144]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[01:31:06.424 --> 01:31:15.031]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[01:31:15.311 --> 01:31:20.013]  Now for the first time, Calbin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[01:31:20.153 --> 01:31:24.194]  That's great news because Calbin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients.
[01:31:24.394 --> 01:31:26.815]  It's earth-friendly and completely environmentally safe.
[01:31:26.995 --> 01:31:31.336]  So if you want yesterday's values today for good old-fashioned pure soap, call 1-800-340-7091.
[01:31:34.557 --> 01:31:35.217]  We don't need no education.
[01:32:02.414 --> 01:32:06.197]  We don't need no thought control.
[01:32:21.437 --> 01:32:29.479]  The mother of two, who lives in Flushing, Queens, used to be a researcher at Mount Sinai Medical Center, but now works full-time as a Falun Gong activist friend said.
[01:32:29.519 --> 01:32:32.460]  There is no higher calling, I would add, to what she's doing.
[01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:35.541]  She was born in China, a naturalized U.S.
[01:32:35.581 --> 01:32:40.122]  citizen, got into the White House grounds of the past from the Epoch Times, Falun Gong newspaper.
[01:32:40.162 --> 01:32:43.723]  We have links to all that up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:32:44.423 --> 01:32:47.504]  I'd love to have 20 million Chinese in America like her.
[01:32:49.554 --> 01:32:51.215]  I mean, she is so American.
[01:32:51.255 --> 01:32:55.097]  She's so much more American than anybody else I see out there.
[01:32:55.157 --> 01:32:56.358]  Pathetic Americans.
[01:32:56.878 --> 01:33:10.887]  I've heard neocons on talk radio saying she deserved to go to prison, that she disrupted it, that she threatened him when her full quote, and we have it here, was simply that the Communist Chinese Party's days are numbered involved in their abuse against Falun Gong and others.
[01:33:11.747 --> 01:33:13.208]  They have mobile execution vans.
[01:33:13.248 --> 01:33:17.431]  They advertise in major publications that they take organs, that they have good, quote, fresh organs.
[01:33:18.542 --> 01:33:24.865]  The British Medical Society, the Society of Transplantee Doctors, all of them have gone public.
[01:33:24.885 --> 01:33:26.126]  It's admitted.
[01:33:26.206 --> 01:33:27.707]  It's been in major publications.
[01:33:29.268 --> 01:33:31.729]  We have video of public executions in China.
[01:33:31.749 --> 01:33:38.152]  We have video of Tiananmen Squares that happen on average every month as they machine gun and attack and murder peaceful farmers.
[01:33:38.273 --> 01:33:40.053]  We're going to play a clip of that in a few minutes.
[01:33:41.354 --> 01:33:42.735]  It is unbelievable.
[01:33:44.224 --> 01:33:48.826]  And now they're talking about charging her with intimidating a public, a foreign official.
[01:33:50.166 --> 01:33:51.426]  Six months in federal prison.
[01:33:52.407 --> 01:33:53.967]  Bush had me arrested back in 1998.
[01:33:54.087 --> 01:33:58.329]  In fact, dig up that clip when I simply asked him a question at a press conference.
[01:33:58.929 --> 01:34:04.571]  So we're becoming like the murdering communist Chinese government who has killed more people than Hitler and Stalin.
[01:34:04.711 --> 01:34:05.491]  Almost combined.
[01:34:06.291 --> 01:34:07.411]  There is no greater evil.
[01:34:08.232 --> 01:34:10.492]  And Wang joins us.
[01:34:12.717 --> 01:34:14.578]  And we really appreciate her.
[01:34:14.598 --> 01:34:21.240]  The press just has her as Wang Wenyi, but she says her full name is Wang Wenyi Wang.
[01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:24.221]  And thank you so much for coming on with us, Doctor.
[01:34:24.241 --> 01:34:25.641]  Oh, thank you.
[01:34:25.882 --> 01:34:28.242]  I'm glad to be your program.
[01:34:29.423 --> 01:34:32.884]  And just because I'm one of these dumb Texans, I'm joking, folks.
[01:34:33.544 --> 01:34:35.245]  Pronounce your full name properly for us.
[01:34:36.365 --> 01:34:38.906]  Last name Wang and first name Wenyi.
[01:34:39.577 --> 01:34:40.738]  Wang Wee?
[01:34:41.098 --> 01:34:41.738]  Wang Wee?
[01:34:41.979 --> 01:34:43.059]  Wang Wee Wong.
[01:34:43.379 --> 01:34:44.580]  Okay, Wang Wee Wong.
[01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:45.301]  Now I got it right.
[01:34:45.941 --> 01:34:49.223]  Well, Dr. Wang Wee Wong, we really appreciate you coming on with us.
[01:34:50.964 --> 01:35:01.011]  First off, I want to talk about what happened when you were in jail after we saw you carted away, what they're charging you with, what you're facing, and then tell us about the murder of a communist Chinese.
[01:35:03.633 --> 01:35:08.436]  They charged me in a stretch to the foreign state police
[01:35:09.378 --> 01:35:14.301]  State of head, that means specifically the Chinese president.
[01:35:15.521 --> 01:35:26.167]  And it's going to be, I think there's a hearing next Wednesday to decide how they are going to proceed legally.
[01:35:26.787 --> 01:35:35.011]  But one thing I just want to make clear, and this is not a threat, because I just want to say
[01:35:37.051 --> 01:35:56.512]  Urgently called upon the people's help because there is an atrocity going on, especially the thousand to thousand life practitioner Falun Gong they held in labor camp and their organs being harvested and some doctors and
[01:35:57.585 --> 01:36:03.169]  Let me stop you there for just a second.
[01:36:03.569 --> 01:36:06.651]  Specifically right now, what are you being charged with?
[01:36:06.671 --> 01:36:08.131]  Because they're saying they're going to charge you.
[01:36:08.191 --> 01:36:12.234]  Have they charged you yet with the intimidating a foreign official?
[01:36:12.834 --> 01:36:16.055]  Yes, that's the charge when they arrest me.
[01:36:16.375 --> 01:36:22.497]  Okay, now let me add to that that I have your full quote here, but can you re-quote it for us?
[01:36:22.857 --> 01:36:26.478]  Because basically you said their days of doing this are numbered.
[01:36:26.838 --> 01:36:35.781]  I would certainly hope their days of grabbing peaceful people and murdering them ghoulishly for their organs would be numbered, but our media is trying to spin that.
[01:36:35.821 --> 01:36:39.402]  Can you please give us exactly what you said?
[01:36:40.843 --> 01:36:44.986]  Because I said in Chinese, I don't know the media how they got the translation.
[01:36:45.006 --> 01:36:58.196]  It's a really distorted message because I said if you continue to persecute Falun Gong and your day will be numbered, that means that your time is running out.
[01:36:58.436 --> 01:37:02.379]  That would be your office, the time in your office.
[01:37:02.659 --> 01:37:07.663]  How could I myself can really stretch such a
[01:37:09.779 --> 01:37:13.542]  The head of state has millions of these soldiers.
[01:37:14.302 --> 01:37:17.805]  I'll tell you, there's four million soldiers in his command.
[01:37:18.205 --> 01:37:21.087]  And how could I have a stretch of his life?
[01:37:21.547 --> 01:37:29.513]  Basically, I just say that there's a saying, Chinese saying, if you do something really bad, something bad will come to you.
[01:37:31.527 --> 01:37:33.848]  We have a lot of Chinese listeners over the Internet.
[01:37:33.868 --> 01:37:42.633]  Why don't you say hi to them and repeat what you said to the dictator of China in Chinese for us?
[01:37:43.093 --> 01:37:45.314]  I just recalled his name, Hu Jingtao.
[01:37:45.334 --> 01:37:45.915]  That's it.
[01:38:00.785 --> 01:38:02.947]  I think the people now have a more connection with the outside world.
[01:38:24.463 --> 01:38:42.237]  And before it was closed up, and now they have, even though they censored the information and severed the connection that the Chinese is outside world, but people can get around and using the internet and watch the program in different ways.
[01:38:42.317 --> 01:38:48.902]  So now they realize what kind of a situation they live, and they want more freedom of speech and privacy.
[01:38:49.352 --> 01:39:01.007]  The freedom of the assembly and the freedom of belief, which ironically and guaranteed by Chinese own constitution, but we never really enjoy that privilege.
[01:39:02.935 --> 01:39:11.682]  The persecution of Falun Gong is one of the typical examples of the Chinese Communist Party regularly do.
[01:39:11.862 --> 01:39:15.284]  They also persecute Buddhists, Christians, basically anybody.
[01:39:16.045 --> 01:39:18.367]  And I'm going to let you get into the persecution of the Falun Gong.
[01:39:18.387 --> 01:39:19.968]  We've covered it quite a bit here, and I've interviewed...
[01:39:20.228 --> 01:39:20.668]  We're good to go.
[01:39:39.184 --> 01:39:46.606]  I think my intention there, and this is coming from a long way, actually.
[01:39:46.766 --> 01:39:50.607]  I try to use the normal channel to deliver the message.
[01:39:50.627 --> 01:40:07.531]  In fact, in the last few weeks, I talked to quite a number of officials in Congress level, Senate level, and to raise the alarm of the message, because I think that right now, still quite a number of the people held in Congress
[01:40:08.692 --> 01:40:11.534]  Labor camp, their organs have been harvested.
[01:40:12.035 --> 01:40:30.610]  And once we report this news in March 8th, that's the first time we report, and there's several thousand people held in one of the facilities in Shenyang City, Liaoning Province, and their organs have been harvested and sold for quite a number of money.
[01:40:31.070 --> 01:40:34.673]  And let me tell you what they're advertising in that website.
[01:40:35.051 --> 01:40:53.006]  The website in that city called China International Transplantation Center in Shenyang, and they advertising worldwide, say, if you want to have an organ transplant coming to our center, we can give you organ within two weeks.
[01:40:53.507 --> 01:40:58.972]  As a physician, I know it's not simple to do the transplantation.
[01:40:59.152 --> 01:41:01.714]  Not only you need a blood type match,
[01:41:02.296 --> 01:41:08.137]  And most importantly, you have to match your tissue, HLA antigens.
[01:41:08.777 --> 01:41:25.061]  So in the United States, if someone wants the kidney or liver, they have to wait for years, or two years minimum, and sometimes the people will wait for longer, because not so many people donate their organs.
[01:41:25.521 --> 01:41:26.361]  But in China,
[01:41:26.775 --> 01:41:33.477]  Because they persecuted Falun Gong, they have the policy say, we kill you because you didn't listen to the Communist Party.
[01:41:33.877 --> 01:41:34.977]  So you're a criminal.
[01:41:35.377 --> 01:41:41.439]  So your body, once you're being killed, they don't need consent from the family member.
[01:41:41.539 --> 01:41:49.481]  They just took it out and sell it in the international market to make money.
[01:41:50.001 --> 01:41:53.522]  Well, Dr. Wong, you've hit the nail on the head here.
[01:41:53.542 --> 01:41:55.022]  Let me break this down for listeners.
[01:41:56.889 --> 01:42:09.457]  The Chinese government and the private hospitals that they control openly, and this has been in the mainstream news, advertise that they have the best organs available.
[01:42:09.777 --> 01:42:15.161]  There's not a two, three year wait like when my step-grandfather had hepatitis from blood transfusion years before.
[01:42:15.521 --> 01:42:18.363]  It took him about two years of waiting to get a proper liver.
[01:42:18.763 --> 01:42:19.103]  We're good to go.
[01:42:19.123 --> 01:42:19.624]  We're good to go.
[01:42:49.143 --> 01:42:49.964]  We're good to go.
[01:43:18.742 --> 01:43:28.268]  They then, this doctor, this incredibly wonderful woman, full of courage and honor, stands up to this brutal sack of demons.
[01:43:28.968 --> 01:43:33.911]  She stands up to him, and then they don't just drag her out and arrest her and charge her with disorderly conduct.
[01:43:34.171 --> 01:43:41.956]  They're charging her with something out of a terrorism subdivision under new laws of intimidating foreign officials, Section 802 of the USA Patriot Act.
[01:43:42.728 --> 01:43:43.088]  Okay?
[01:43:43.288 --> 01:43:48.131]  I want Americans to realize the type of evil we're wallowing in.
[01:43:48.451 --> 01:43:55.475]  Now, from the inside reports you've gotten, can you describe, doctor, how they murder these people, exactly what goes on for us?
[01:43:56.196 --> 01:44:03.660]  In fact, the March 8th, our newspaper report, because two witnesses came to us from China.
[01:44:04.028 --> 01:44:06.850]  They risked their life and told us the story.
[01:44:07.431 --> 01:44:12.635]  Before that, I have collected six cases of this, but an individual one.
[01:44:13.015 --> 01:44:17.879]  That time, and I saw, for example, Mr. Wang Bin is 47 years old.
[01:44:18.039 --> 01:44:23.403]  He's from an oil factory in Daqing, an oil factory.
[01:44:23.924 --> 01:44:30.409]  And his family sent me a photo and showed an autopsy card from the throat to the back.
[01:44:30.956 --> 01:44:34.439]  To the lower abdomen, and that's an autopsy cut.
[01:44:34.799 --> 01:44:41.725]  Then family member said, he's a peaceful practitioner just because he continued the practice.
[01:44:41.745 --> 01:44:43.107]  They tortured him to death.
[01:44:43.487 --> 01:44:52.495]  Then they, without our consent, they had an autopsy, took his organ out from throat, the underneath.
[01:44:52.515 --> 01:44:53.776]  That means abdomen...
[01:44:54.548 --> 01:45:14.527]  Now, ma'am, doctor, the Falun Gong is known for being totally peaceful, but now our media would just run the headline, Chinese government says they're a dangerous cult, and then wouldn't even say who you are or what you are.
[01:45:14.647 --> 01:45:17.770]  Our media is now demonizing the Falun Gong.
[01:45:18.966 --> 01:45:26.287]  And I think a lot of media, because they couldn't get the information, they just copied the communist media.
[01:45:26.568 --> 01:45:32.769]  But in China, you have to realize that the state-run media is a mouthpiece of the communist party.
[01:45:33.329 --> 01:45:33.949]  They know that.
[01:45:33.989 --> 01:45:34.409]  They know that.
[01:45:34.469 --> 01:45:40.130]  Why are the, I mean, CNN cut the feed of you for the Chinese without the Chinese even asking?
[01:45:40.170 --> 01:45:43.711]  What does that mean to you that CNN cut your international feed?
[01:45:45.812 --> 01:45:46.492]  I don't know.
[01:45:47.693 --> 01:45:51.913]  Actually, I was interviewed later and live the program.
[01:45:51.933 --> 01:45:55.974]  They gave me four minutes to talk about this organ harvest.
[01:45:56.434 --> 01:46:00.495]  But I didn't have time to expand, to explain what's going on.
[01:46:00.795 --> 01:46:09.677]  I told them this is an unspeakable crime which all the humanity, all the races should stand up and say no.
[01:46:10.322 --> 01:46:12.144]  Otherwise, it's a shame for us.
[01:46:12.404 --> 01:46:13.805]  And let it continue.
[01:46:14.205 --> 01:46:17.008]  And this is involving thousands and thousands of people's lives.
[01:46:17.308 --> 01:46:22.172]  It's a crime that we just simply cannot tolerate.
[01:46:22.713 --> 01:46:27.076]  Just from the camps you know of, how many people are they brutally murdering for their organs?
[01:46:28.117 --> 01:46:30.659]  And the witness came to us.
[01:46:30.799 --> 01:46:32.921]  They talk about thousands of them.
[01:46:33.301 --> 01:46:38.206]  And it's interesting that once we exposed this case,
[01:46:39.367 --> 01:46:41.508]  China is kind of chaotic over there.
[01:46:41.828 --> 01:46:52.811]  And three weeks after we exposed this case, they had a foreign ministry spokesperson had a conference in Beijing, said this is a liar.
[01:46:53.671 --> 01:47:01.953]  After three weeks, then they said, now we will welcome all the investigation team coming to the facility to have an investigation.
[01:47:02.753 --> 01:47:06.935]  And of course, that three weeks, you can imagine what they can do.
[01:47:07.015 --> 01:47:08.415]  They can clear up everything
[01:47:09.250 --> 01:47:12.351]  Yeah, they had a stage-managed Warren Commission.
[01:47:12.931 --> 01:47:23.455]  Actually, they invited diplomats from the United States two weeks after we published the paper.
[01:47:24.348 --> 01:47:29.092]  Well, it makes it even more ridiculous that your group is known to be totally peaceful.
[01:47:29.132 --> 01:47:30.994]  That's part of your religious beliefs.
[01:47:31.875 --> 01:47:34.497]  For those that don't know, describe what the Falun Gong are.
[01:47:34.937 --> 01:47:36.118]  Describe your basic tenets.
[01:47:36.678 --> 01:47:41.563]  Yes, and the Falun Gong is a very ancient type of practice.
[01:47:41.963 --> 01:47:44.445]  And we call it the mind-body exercise.
[01:47:44.980 --> 01:47:48.983]  The theory is really rooted from the Buddha school and Tao school.
[01:47:49.023 --> 01:47:50.284]  You know the Tai Chi, right?
[01:47:50.304 --> 01:47:50.364]  Yes.
[01:47:50.705 --> 01:47:54.968]  The Tai Chi is very similar to Tai Chi, very slow motion exercise.
[01:47:54.988 --> 01:48:01.473]  There's a five-step exercise you can do and give your energy, purify your body.
[01:48:01.894 --> 01:48:07.058]  And so there is a spiritual or moral teaching principle.
[01:48:07.078 --> 01:48:08.719]  The Tibetan monks do this.
[01:48:08.739 --> 01:48:10.901]  They call it the Fountain of Youth.
[01:48:11.942 --> 01:48:14.524]  Then they teach truthfulness, compassion, tolerance.
[01:48:15.377 --> 01:48:25.025]  As a physician, I know this is... If you want to be healthy and well-being, you need to practice something both mentally and physically.
[01:48:25.065 --> 01:48:28.207]  Why are the communist Chinese butchers so afraid of Falun Gong?
[01:48:28.727 --> 01:48:42.358]  I think because they feel... First of all, because such practices talk about the balance of both mind and body, they didn't want people to know or to be...
[01:48:43.399 --> 01:48:47.440]  To be conscious about themselves and to study something.
[01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:50.740]  It's outside of the Chinese Communist ideology.
[01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:52.101]  They don't want people to have an identity.
[01:48:52.461 --> 01:48:52.721]  You're right.
[01:48:52.981 --> 01:49:02.083]  Then, another thing is, they're really, really scared of the rapids that repute the popularity of Falun Gong.
[01:49:02.123 --> 01:49:06.244]  Because in seven years, they go up like double the Communist Party number.
[01:49:06.644 --> 01:49:09.224]  A hundred million people practice in seven years.
[01:49:09.444 --> 01:49:11.585]  Is their persecution of Falun Gong working?
[01:49:12.605 --> 01:49:12.965]  And the...
[01:49:13.704 --> 01:49:14.845]  Not working at all.
[01:49:15.205 --> 01:49:27.195]  And because since they start the persecution, and in fact, outside China, there's 75 countries of people start practicing Falun Gong.
[01:49:28.015 --> 01:49:37.963]  The more press, the more people coming to find out what's going on, then a lot of people, including the Westerners, start practicing Falun Gong.
[01:49:39.509 --> 01:49:47.721]  Well, I know before the mid-70s, these murdering Chinese communist leaders didn't come here, and I don't think our president should meet with them.
[01:49:48.342 --> 01:49:52.548]  They are disgusting criminals, and to meet with them only gives a maiden comfort.
[01:49:54.224 --> 01:49:57.088]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:57.348 --> 01:49:58.930]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.

[01:52:55.839 --> 01:52:56.320]  Don't worry.
[01:52:56.800 --> 01:52:58.322]  This show is documented.
[01:52:58.843 --> 01:53:01.647]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:02.027 --> 01:53:05.511]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:53:05.972 --> 01:53:10.037]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[01:53:10.598 --> 01:53:12.540]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[01:53:13.481 --> 01:53:16.423]  Dr. Wing-Wei Wong is our guest.
[01:53:18.305 --> 01:53:22.908]  Doctor, give out of the Falun Gong websites or news websites where our listeners can learn more.
[01:53:22.948 --> 01:53:29.693]  I know we have links on infowars.com over to your organization's sites, but give those out for our listeners, please.
[01:53:30.013 --> 01:53:30.313]  Yes.
[01:53:31.054 --> 01:53:34.176]  If you're interested, you can log in to www.falun.org.
[01:53:34.476 --> 01:53:37.618]  The Falun Dafa spelling is A.
[01:53:42.792 --> 01:53:47.295]  F-A-L-U-N-D-A-F-A.
[01:53:48.256 --> 01:53:49.117]  That's O-R-G.
[01:53:49.237 --> 01:53:50.738]  Or they go to the Epoch Times.
[01:53:51.318 --> 01:54:00.246]  And the Epoch Times, yes, that's the newspaper we exposed what happened in China, the cases I mentioned, and we have a serious report.
[01:54:00.846 --> 01:54:06.631]  And the website is www.epochtimes.com.
[01:54:06.671 --> 01:54:08.752]  That's in Chinese, E-P-O-C-H, Times.com.
[01:54:11.078 --> 01:54:13.700]  And for the English, we have eight languages.
[01:54:13.860 --> 01:54:15.961]  This is an international newspaper.
[01:54:15.981 --> 01:54:18.603]  Eight languages distributed in about 40 countries.
[01:54:19.184 --> 01:54:23.266]  So the English one is TheEpochTime.com.
[01:54:23.767 --> 01:54:27.870]  Now, we've also confirmed that they also murder Christians and take their organs.
[01:54:27.890 --> 01:54:29.551]  Can you tell us about it?
[01:54:30.131 --> 01:54:37.076]  In fact, in the last 13 years, they have documented the white surprise of the year.
[01:54:38.153 --> 01:54:42.459]  Abuse using the executed prisoners, the organs.
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:49.389]  So Congress actually started the hearing from 1995, and the most recent one is just, I think there's a,
[01:54:53.132 --> 01:54:59.216]  April 19th, the day before Hu Jintao came to Capitol Hill, then they actually had a hearing.
[01:54:59.516 --> 01:55:01.818]  Yes, there are congressional ongoing hearings.
[01:55:01.898 --> 01:55:03.299]  It's admitted it's going on.
[01:55:03.319 --> 01:55:09.323]  And the national media says that Falun Gong claims, specifically Christians and other groups.
[01:55:09.343 --> 01:55:11.604]  Can you tell us about how they're murdered?
[01:55:12.425 --> 01:55:13.525]  They actually...
[01:55:14.901 --> 01:55:32.469]  The Christians and other dissidents, anyone, you have your own belief, and the underground church, and people being suffering, and the culture, and quite a number of the people being beaten to death, they're all going to be thinking out.
[01:55:33.029 --> 01:55:42.994]  Last year, the minister, the vice minister of the health department of China, came to one of the meetings in Beijing,
[01:55:43.544 --> 01:55:55.734]  The Philippines admit most of the 95% of the organ transplantation taking place and the donor actually from the executed prisoner.
[01:55:57.936 --> 01:56:04.462]  In China, they said that those organs, they got consent from their family member.
[01:56:04.722 --> 01:56:10.727]  But in fact, most of the time, they really threaten the people to
[01:56:14.407 --> 01:56:20.368]  We've also caught them selling the dead bodies of babies that they murder in front of the parents if they have more than two children.
[01:56:21.068 --> 01:56:27.870]  I also wanted to bring up the riots every month where the farmers are fighting back against machine guns.
[01:56:27.910 --> 01:56:28.790]  Were you aware of that?
[01:56:28.810 --> 01:56:31.391]  Do you have comments on the growing resistance in China?
[01:56:32.311 --> 01:56:36.692]  Oh, that one, I probably am not in a good position to make a comment.
[01:56:37.390 --> 01:56:53.119]  Only thing I can add to that for the news I reported is regarding the military part is there's a famous argument that last year in June the former general of the Chinese army
[01:56:54.434 --> 01:57:00.721]  Zhu Chenghu, who is now the dean of the Defense University of Beijing.
[01:57:00.741 --> 01:57:02.163]  Yes, he said he'd nuke the U.S.
[01:57:02.543 --> 01:57:02.843]  Right.
[01:57:03.204 --> 01:57:14.997]  And he actually said that if anyone in the United States coming in between Taiwan and China, they are going to use the nuclear weapon to wipe out 200 cities.
[01:57:16.870 --> 01:57:22.413]  Exactly.
[01:57:23.494 --> 01:57:26.856]  Doctor, one more little five-minute segment with you, then you've got to go on the BBC.
[01:57:26.876 --> 01:57:28.717]  Yeah, they're our friends.
[01:57:28.757 --> 01:57:31.178]  They're targeting us to kill us, and they're our friends.
[01:57:31.198 --> 01:57:37.341]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7000.
[01:57:48.587 --> 01:57:49.247]  Big Brother.
[01:57:49.908 --> 01:57:50.948]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:51.669 --> 01:57:52.769]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:53.430 --> 01:57:54.250]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.010 --> 01:57:55.891]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:55.911 --> 01:58:00.253]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:00.754 --> 01:58:04.876]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:04.896 --> 01:58:10.479]  She's leaving us in a few minutes and I'll get into some other news issues and items internationally, nationally.
[01:58:11.431 --> 01:58:17.353]  But she's Dr. Wing-Wing Wong, and you saw her get arrested for simply asking a mass murdering killer.
[01:58:18.073 --> 01:58:22.394]  Killed more people, works for the government to kill more people than Hitler and Stalin.
[01:58:23.435 --> 01:58:26.195]  Openly selling organs on the world market, publicly doing it.
[01:58:26.715 --> 01:58:31.397]  The big story is our media spins it and acts like they don't know if it's true, when in the past they've admitted it.
[01:58:32.117 --> 01:58:35.478]  And I just want to commend you, Dr. Wong, for your amazing courage.
[01:58:35.878 --> 01:58:37.138]  My heart goes out to you.
[01:58:37.158 --> 01:58:38.719]  I will pray for you.
[01:58:39.745 --> 01:58:40.926]  I believe in what you're doing.
[01:58:41.467 --> 01:58:42.668]  Your courage is amazing.
[01:58:42.708 --> 01:58:45.290]  You totally did what Americans wouldn't do.
[01:58:45.931 --> 01:58:54.819]  You shifted it away from this love fest with this murderer and made everybody face the evil of our country being in bed with these people.
[01:58:55.379 --> 01:58:59.043]  And then you bring up how the top communist general says they're targeting 200 U.S.
[01:58:59.063 --> 01:59:02.046]  cities, called a press conference, said they'll preemptively kill us.
[01:59:02.447 --> 01:59:06.531]  They're threatening to kill all our families, but our government loves them and Walmart loves them.
[01:59:06.551 --> 01:59:08.153]  This is serious business.
[01:59:08.754 --> 01:59:10.716]  Closing comments here in the last few minutes, Doctor.
[01:59:11.676 --> 01:59:17.302]  And there was one thing I want to say, and for Falun Gong practitioners, they are very peaceful.
[01:59:17.643 --> 01:59:31.037]  For me, there's one thing you talk about me, I just want to make one correction, because I came to this country 20 years ago as a student, then I got a PhD in the University of Chicago, then I
[01:59:31.547 --> 01:59:42.813]  I passed the board exam, so I trained as a pathologist in UC San Diego, University of California, San Diego, and the Mount Sinai Hospital.
[01:59:43.233 --> 01:59:56.220]  Now I'm currently the chief editor for the medicine and the life magazine, and I volunteer to do this for the Epoch Times, especially the health related to the news.
[01:59:56.890 --> 02:00:07.222]  The really reason I'm doing this this time is because I feel the urgency to stop the life-harvesting organs from practitioners.
[02:00:07.262 --> 02:00:08.243]  They are peaceful.
[02:00:08.563 --> 02:00:17.313]  They just simply have this belief and practice something good for their body and mind, and they should have a right and a privilege for that.
[02:00:17.353 --> 02:00:17.573]  Yes, doctor.
[02:00:18.913 --> 02:00:29.982]  And I would add to that, the addendum, that you've already made them shut down one of the execution harvesting centers at least for a few weeks when they had a staged inspection.
[02:00:30.022 --> 02:00:32.064]  So you have already saved some lives.
[02:00:33.044 --> 02:00:39.290]  And so I want this Chinese leader to know what's going on and if they really...
[02:00:40.504 --> 02:00:42.906]  Really want to work for the people.
[02:00:42.986 --> 02:00:44.767]  They should investigate fully.
[02:00:45.007 --> 02:00:53.213]  And I opened up this for independent international team to fully investigate throughout all the labor camps in China.
[02:00:53.313 --> 02:00:54.453]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:00:54.554 --> 02:00:56.015]  So you're calling for international investigation.
[02:00:56.035 --> 02:00:56.755]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:00:57.175 --> 02:01:00.277]  How do the communist police and military feed on their own people?
[02:01:00.598 --> 02:01:02.299]  How do they bash babies' brains out?
[02:01:02.639 --> 02:01:03.800]  How do they steal organs?
[02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:06.902]  How do they engage in this evil and feel good about themselves?
[02:01:08.184 --> 02:01:19.387]  And there's two witnesses told us, because her husband is the removal, the cornea, the responsible, removed the cornea from practitioner Falun Gong.
[02:01:19.947 --> 02:01:34.490]  And he told us that Falun Gong, they gave some kind of the anesthetic, then they actually took the organ, because the blood, for example, the heart, when you take it out, within four or six hours, you should transplant.
[02:01:34.610 --> 02:01:35.731]  Otherwise, they died, no use.
[02:01:35.791 --> 02:01:35.871]  So...
[02:01:37.887 --> 02:01:46.018]  They just do it in life person, then they basically kill the person, life the person, then give it to another.
[02:01:46.419 --> 02:01:49.503]  The heart they sell in international community is 200,000 U.S.
[02:01:49.543 --> 02:01:50.083]  dollar.
[02:01:50.104 --> 02:01:51.686]  That's 2 million Chinese dollars.
[02:01:54.605 --> 02:01:57.807]  For the kidney, they sell the $62,000.
[02:01:57.947 --> 02:01:59.988]  I'm not saying for life and anything.
[02:02:00.369 --> 02:02:04.151]  Anyone can log in their website to take a look at.
[02:02:04.311 --> 02:02:07.233]  Yeah, tell us that website, because you're doing this for money is what you're saying.
[02:02:07.273 --> 02:02:08.034]  Give us the website.
[02:02:08.054 --> 02:02:09.154]  I'll just go to the website.
[02:02:09.174 --> 02:02:14.638]  Tap in the China International Transplantation Center, Assistance Center.
[02:02:15.438 --> 02:02:22.523]  So yesterday, the British Committee, Ethnic Committee for Transplantation Center, the doctor said,
[02:02:23.442 --> 02:02:23.802]  Absolutely.
[02:02:23.822 --> 02:02:26.644]  Doctor, again, I only want to commend you for your amazing courage.
[02:02:26.664 --> 02:02:27.145]  We salute you, Dr. Wong.
[02:02:44.989 --> 02:02:52.372]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:02:52.652 --> 02:02:57.394]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist hasher plan for world domination.
[02:02:57.614 --> 02:03:03.256]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:03:03.496 --> 02:03:08.018]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:03:08.239 --> 02:03:15.402]  The casual society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:03:15.422 --> 02:03:19.945]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:03:20.125 --> 02:03:22.626]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:03:22.866 --> 02:03:29.570]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:03:29.790 --> 02:03:30.911]  Or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:03:30.931 --> 02:03:31.171]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:03:44.179 --> 02:03:44.299]  Yep.
[02:04:04.718 --> 02:04:05.218]  We're good to go.
[02:04:28.445 --> 02:04:32.371]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:04:33.132 --> 02:04:33.813]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:46.641 --> 02:04:48.141]  Pain, illness, and disease.
[02:04:48.321 --> 02:04:51.462]  When natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach.
[02:04:51.682 --> 02:04:56.683]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[02:04:57.023 --> 02:05:04.925]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:05:05.085 --> 02:05:12.127]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:05:12.347 --> 02:05:13.549]  There are no side effects.
[02:05:13.709 --> 02:05:17.094]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:05:17.154 --> 02:05:18.255]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:05:18.556 --> 02:05:19.838]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:05:20.038 --> 02:05:26.887]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:05:26.987 --> 02:05:29.451]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[02:05:32.552 --> 02:05:32.612]  866-885-6625.
[02:05:32.632 --> 02:05:33.632]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:05:33.692 --> 02:05:34.952]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:34.993 --> 02:05:36.913]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:52.671 --> 02:05:59.438]  We've had a lot of requests to re-air one of the first CNN interviews I did about Charlie Sheen, who's now being whipped to shreds in a staged event.
[02:06:00.319 --> 02:06:01.400]  What he's called extortion.
[02:06:01.520 --> 02:06:03.803]  He refused to be extorted, so this is happening.
[02:06:03.823 --> 02:06:05.625]  I'm sure you've heard about the national demonization.
[02:06:07.332 --> 02:06:24.701]  Dr. Wing Wee Wong is facing six plus months, six or more months, in federal prison for, quote, intimidating a foreign official by simply saying the Communist Party, if they don't stop persecuting Falun Gong and others, that their days are numbered in power.
[02:06:25.001 --> 02:06:31.965]  The media just took the days are numbered, messed with the media to try to set the precedent and impress China that we're just as evil as they are.
[02:06:33.101 --> 02:06:35.942]  They've caught Austin Hospital stealing corny as a dead people.
[02:06:36.442 --> 02:06:37.143]  That's one thing.
[02:06:37.183 --> 02:06:39.163]  But murdering someone for their organs.
[02:06:39.604 --> 02:06:41.524]  Came out in 60 minutes, what, about 10 years ago.
[02:06:41.544 --> 02:06:43.505]  I remember watching it at my grandparents' house.
[02:06:44.065 --> 02:06:49.887]  That they were, in hospitals around America, they're killing people that come in from car wrecks that can be saved, who aren't brain dead, and they're killing them.
[02:06:50.588 --> 02:06:53.129]  Because, what, you get about 400 plus thousand.
[02:06:54.069 --> 02:06:56.330]  The hospital makes that profit, by the way, as people don't know.
[02:06:57.037 --> 02:06:59.819]  You could say, hey, I'm an organ donor, but my family gets half the money.
[02:06:59.859 --> 02:07:00.679]  No, no, that doesn't happen.
[02:07:01.019 --> 02:07:02.540]  And so they murder you for your organs.
[02:07:02.580 --> 02:07:09.464]  My dad's a dentist and oral surgeon and worked in hospitals, and he told me when I was getting my driver's license, he said, don't sign the organ donor card.
[02:07:09.924 --> 02:07:13.546]  He goes, it's well known in the industry that some hospitals murder for the organs.
[02:07:14.366 --> 02:07:21.470]  And then I rolled my eyes at that, and a few years later I saw it on national TV, and a few years after that I heard about a scandal in Dallas with it.
[02:07:23.144 --> 02:07:28.265]  And so $400,000 to the Communist Chinese, even more than that in Chinese dollars.
[02:07:29.645 --> 02:07:30.645]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:07:31.306 --> 02:07:32.586]  We know this is going on.
[02:07:32.646 --> 02:07:33.806]  We know this is happening.
[02:07:34.466 --> 02:07:40.747]  I haven't really plugged my videos yet today, and I need to because they're great films and it makes this broadcast possible.
[02:07:41.167 --> 02:07:46.148]  Please go to InfoWars.com, to the Safe Secure Online video store and bookstore.

[02:08:30.431 --> 02:08:35.295]  There's a lot of other documentaries we've been authorized to post that are there as well at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:38.118 --> 02:08:40.764]  Alright, here's the first CNN show that I was on.
[02:08:41.205 --> 02:08:44.953]  We'll go ahead and roll this, then we'll come back, cover news, and take your calls.
[02:08:45.273 --> 02:08:45.734]  Stay with us.
[02:08:47.748 --> 02:08:49.569]  And it really is exciting.
[02:08:49.589 --> 02:09:02.715]  We were speaking a few moments ago about Charlie Sheen coming forward this week with his notion that the government may actually have been behind September 11 and the September 11 attacks and the conspiracy theories in general surrounding 9-11.
[02:09:03.075 --> 02:09:07.897]  What do you make of an actor of his stature coming out publicly like that?
[02:09:08.057 --> 02:09:11.799]  I think he's a brave man to even question this aloud.
[02:09:12.479 --> 02:09:17.607]  In an environment where people have been saying that anyone who questions the government is a traitor.
[02:09:18.188 --> 02:09:19.971]  So Charlie Sheen has done his homework.
[02:09:20.718 --> 02:09:22.499]  And he's asking questions.
[02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:26.342]  He's speaking truth to power, which is a brave thing to do.
[02:09:26.802 --> 02:09:37.490]  Look, the young people in my family, my nephews for example, have been saying for the past three, four years that we are not learning everything about 9-11 that we're meant to learn.
[02:09:37.970 --> 02:09:48.458]  And specifically, they've been saying that if you read all the different websites, if you're really careful, what you discover is that a lot of facts don't add up.
[02:09:48.618 --> 02:09:59.621]  And even if a modicum of what is being put out there, all these conspiracy theories, even if a piece of that is true, we have a responsibility, don't you think, to be asking the questions and to be doing the investigation?
[02:09:59.681 --> 02:10:02.382]  I think it's very patriotic to investigate it.
[02:10:03.003 --> 02:10:10.585]  Throughout all of history, the basic premise of tyrants has been dictators, shall we say.
[02:10:10.965 --> 02:10:13.906]  And I think it's fair to say that George W. Bush is a dictator.
[02:10:14.606 --> 02:10:16.907]  That's a pretty strong statement for you to say, though.
[02:10:16.927 --> 02:10:18.308]  Are you at all fearful of a backlash?
[02:10:18.728 --> 02:10:22.650]  I mean, seriously, a lot of people are afraid to come out on television.
[02:10:22.670 --> 02:10:24.411]  You just called Mr. Bush a dictator.
[02:10:36.237 --> 02:10:40.663]  He is a dictator, and yet he blithely goes on ignoring the will of the people.
[02:10:41.144 --> 02:10:42.346]  I call that a dictator.
[02:10:42.767 --> 02:10:49.817]  But as far as 9-11 is concerned, it's a great gambit to tell the people, you have an external enemy.
[02:10:50.706 --> 02:10:53.107]  The external enemy is terrorism.
[02:10:53.587 --> 02:10:56.208]  We have a war that will go on for centuries.
[02:10:56.528 --> 02:10:58.668]  It will go on till the end of time.
[02:10:58.928 --> 02:11:03.510]  Well, that's a great way to scare people and to make them believe whatever you say.
[02:11:04.090 --> 02:11:06.550]  And Bush is not the first to do it.
[02:11:06.931 --> 02:11:12.812]  Throughout history, people have been doing that in order to fool all of the people all of the time.
[02:11:13.292 --> 02:11:19.194]  So I think that Charlie Sheen is really patriotic and brave to ask these questions.
[02:11:19.694 --> 02:11:22.515]  I don't know what the answer to these questions is.
[02:11:23.095 --> 02:11:29.878]  I read the article in New York Magazine, and I think just asking questions is brave and patriotic.
[02:11:29.938 --> 02:11:32.739]  And as I mentioned, we'll be speaking with that author from New York Magazine coming up.
[02:11:32.759 --> 02:11:35.199]  Well, I think it's great that you're investigating.
[02:11:35.740 --> 02:11:36.940]  I don't know what the answer is.
[02:11:37.280 --> 02:11:38.641]  I don't know if we'll ever know.
[02:11:38.661 --> 02:11:42.262]  I don't know the answer to the Kennedy assassination.
[02:11:43.202 --> 02:11:49.806]  But I think that it's a job of writers and of talented people to investigate this stuff.
[02:11:50.166 --> 02:11:52.007]  We were talking about Charlie Sheen in all the comments.
[02:11:52.047 --> 02:11:53.068]  I just have to get your take.
[02:11:53.088 --> 02:11:55.049]  I mean, you seem a little blown away that he would come forward.
[02:11:55.329 --> 02:11:56.330]  Well, it's impressive.
[02:11:56.370 --> 02:12:01.253]  I mean, it's impressive for somebody in any kind of high-profile position to challenge the government when you're getting...
[02:12:02.256 --> 02:12:05.579]  Average people, you know, slandered for any kind of opposition.
[02:12:05.619 --> 02:12:06.840]  Would you ever do something like that?
[02:12:06.860 --> 02:12:07.481]  I probably wouldn't.
[02:12:07.501 --> 02:12:09.883]  I usually keep my politics to private conversations.
[02:12:09.963 --> 02:12:19.971]  But I appreciate the fact that he's prepared and coming out and saying this is something... And I like that he says, if you want to investigate anything, investigate the facts.
[02:12:20.011 --> 02:12:23.054]  Don't try and turn it around on me, which is what's been happening so much with this administration.
[02:12:23.414 --> 02:12:31.323]  Anybody who challenges anything with a reasonable challenge gets slandered and criticized for posing.
[02:12:31.463 --> 02:12:36.748]  New York Magazine is out with a story on all of the 9-11 conspiracy theories that are floating out there.
[02:12:36.788 --> 02:12:39.091]  It's called the Ground Zero Grassy Knoll.
[02:12:39.471 --> 02:12:41.493]  Contributing editor Mark Jacobson wrote the piece.
[02:12:41.834 --> 02:12:43.195]  Mark's joining us live on show this night.
[02:12:43.215 --> 02:12:44.156]  Mark, thanks for stopping in.
[02:12:44.516 --> 02:12:44.957]  No problem.
[02:12:45.217 --> 02:12:50.481]  It's quite an explosion that has happened here this week as a result of Charlie Sheen's comments on this radio show on Monday.
[02:12:50.541 --> 02:12:53.003]  You started working on this story a few months back.
[02:12:53.344 --> 02:12:55.305]  People weren't really talking about this.
[02:12:55.505 --> 02:12:59.709]  Well, not the people that are interested in it were talking about it, but everybody else thought it was out of my mind.
[02:13:00.129 --> 02:13:09.897]  So do you think now that you have a big Hollywood star who is taking an undeniable risk by coming forward, do you think this is going to give it legs and suddenly people are really going to start...
[02:13:10.317 --> 02:13:14.641]  I think it would be better if it was Martin Sheen rather than Charlie Sheen because he's the president, right?
[02:13:16.042 --> 02:13:16.842]  Sometimes we wish.
[02:13:18.584 --> 02:13:25.589]  Yeah, that was the clip after the second time I was on.
[02:13:26.370 --> 02:13:31.374]  They then played some clips of some of the other individuals, more from a liberal view.
[02:13:32.379 --> 02:13:45.010]  Some of them just can't seem to figure out that the Democratic Party is certainly involved in the 9-11 cover-up as well, and that George Bush is a dictator because of the police state he's setting up and the Patriot Act, and not because of abortion.
[02:13:45.940 --> 02:13:50.062]  And of course, Bush has been trying to block South Dakota and others.
[02:13:50.502 --> 02:14:03.708]  They're trying to block abortion, and he signed back on to UNESCO, the UN agency that runs much of that, and actually cut some abortion funding as a gimmick, and then more than tripled the actual UN abortion funding that this government gives them.
[02:14:05.259 --> 02:14:07.360]  Let's go ahead and roll another clip from CNN.
[02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:14.641]  As I mentioned, the radio host who interviewed Sheen is Alex Jones of the Genesis Communications Network.
[02:14:15.041 --> 02:14:19.182]  Alex joins me live from Austin, Texas to talk about Sheen's riveting comments.
[02:14:19.602 --> 02:14:23.803]  Alex, as I mentioned, the response that we got from doing this story last night, absolutely shocking.
[02:14:23.823 --> 02:14:25.684]  So I want to know how it actually all came about.
[02:14:26.064 --> 02:14:28.344]  How did the interview with Charlie Sheen actually happen?
[02:14:28.364 --> 02:14:29.485]  Did you guys reach out to him?
[02:14:29.505 --> 02:14:30.125]  Did he call you?
[02:14:30.185 --> 02:14:30.705]  What was the deal?
[02:14:31.440 --> 02:14:37.402]  Well, just to make something clear, Mr. Sheen has amazing courage to do what he's done, and he contacted me.
[02:14:37.442 --> 02:14:39.623]  He's been watching my documentaries for years.
[02:14:39.663 --> 02:14:43.084]  He's one of the most informed people that I've talked to in Hollywood on this subject.
[02:14:43.104 --> 02:14:49.466]  Listen, for years, Hollywood's been on fire with people knowing the truth about 9-11, and I was the first to expose 9-11 on the day.
[02:14:49.506 --> 02:14:54.727]  In fact, two months before, I had intel that elements of the military-industrial complex were going to carry out the attack.
[02:14:54.767 --> 02:14:59.889]  I said, they'll use bin Laden, the known CIA asset as their patsy, to take the blame for attacking the towers.
[02:15:00.169 --> 02:15:05.231]  So Mr. Sheen is only exceptional in that he has courage in going public.
[02:15:05.291 --> 02:15:07.172]  Courage that no one else in Hollywood had.
[02:15:07.192 --> 02:15:13.555]  I mean, here's a CNN poll from Anderson Cooper a year and a half ago where they said, is the government covering up 9-11?
[02:15:13.595 --> 02:15:14.455]  Could they be involved?
[02:15:15.636 --> 02:15:18.737]  90% when the poll closed on CNN said this.
[02:15:18.777 --> 02:15:20.758]  So listen, I have my own syndicated show.
[02:15:20.858 --> 02:15:23.500]  I've done 4,000 radio interviews in the last four and a half years.
[02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:25.761]  Almost no one calls in and disagrees now.
[02:15:26.001 --> 02:15:28.442]  We have the majority view and we have the evidence.
[02:15:28.602 --> 02:15:28.682]  And
[02:15:29.282 --> 02:15:31.444]  Bottom line, there are declassified U.S.
[02:15:31.464 --> 02:15:35.027]  government documents like Operation Northwoods that ABC News reported on back in 2000.
[02:15:35.808 --> 02:15:36.769]  Operation Northwoods.
[02:15:36.809 --> 02:15:37.249]  Google it.
[02:15:37.609 --> 02:15:38.590]  And in there, the U.S.
[02:15:38.650 --> 02:15:44.435]  government, an element of it, said we want to hijack jets, fire remote control, crash them, and blame it on the Soviet Union and Cuba.
[02:15:44.656 --> 02:15:46.497]  Now, that was decades ago.
[02:15:46.597 --> 02:15:48.038]  This is why we believe this.
[02:15:48.099 --> 02:15:52.682]  Then you look at the official story, the firefighters, the police, hundreds of them saying there were bombs in the buildings.
[02:15:52.883 --> 02:15:53.904]  They were told to shut up.
[02:15:54.064 --> 02:15:56.085]  You look at Building 7, detonators are going off.
[02:15:56.105 --> 02:15:56.726]  You can see the explosion.
[02:15:56.886 --> 02:15:59.607]  And Alex, a lot of this is what Charlie Sheen was covering.
[02:15:59.627 --> 02:16:02.167]  I'm actually just curious, did he reach out to you guys?
[02:16:02.227 --> 02:16:05.188]  Is he the one who put the call in to you about how he wound up on your show?
[02:16:05.468 --> 02:16:09.789]  Sure, he called me a few weeks ago and said that he loves this country.
[02:16:09.809 --> 02:16:11.129]  He had nothing to gain from this.
[02:16:11.189 --> 02:16:12.490]  In fact, it's dangerous for him to do.
[02:16:12.670 --> 02:16:16.191]  But he said, I love this country and my kids so much, but I'm going to do this, Alex.
[02:16:16.391 --> 02:16:22.352]  And I said, God bless you, because now it makes for other Hollywood people who've got major pull, who know the truth, to start going public.
[02:16:22.512 --> 02:16:29.419]  And dangerous indeed to do because a lot of what he said makes a lot of people sort of sit back and say, whoa, I don't know about that.
[02:16:29.439 --> 02:16:34.885]  And what's really important here, you may not agree with everything that Charlie Sheen had to say.
[02:16:35.086 --> 02:16:41.893]  I personally think it's a good thing that he did go on your show so he could go public with his point of view because it does get people talking.
[02:16:42.233 --> 02:16:48.599]  You know, there are a lot of people who may look at this, however, and say there just goes another Hollywood nutjob shooting off his mouth.
[02:16:49.660 --> 02:16:57.648]  I imagine that you think, though, having a Hollywood actor on your side is a good thing, and as you mentioned, may bring some more people to the table talking about this.
[02:16:57.768 --> 02:16:58.228]  Sure, sure.
[02:16:58.248 --> 02:17:03.192]  I mean, if you knew some of the Hollywood names that are aware of 9-11, we're talking some of the biggest people.
[02:17:03.232 --> 02:17:05.614]  And any you can tell us about that you've been in contact with?
[02:17:05.634 --> 02:17:12.639]  No, I can't, because people in Hollywood contact me because I have integrity, and I've been in a few films, and they know me, and they know I keep my mouth shut.
[02:17:13.019 --> 02:17:14.740]  You know, it was kind of like back in high school.
[02:17:15.100 --> 02:17:18.163]  I learned to keep my mouth shut about girls I was dating, and all the girls started liking me.
[02:17:18.423 --> 02:17:19.504]  Look, it's really simple.
[02:17:19.864 --> 02:17:21.225]  Let's understand this, okay?
[02:17:22.549 --> 02:17:23.810]  9-11 was an inside job.
[02:17:23.830 --> 02:17:25.471]  It was a self-inflicted wound.
[02:17:25.992 --> 02:17:28.855]  And what Charlie Sheen is doing is just amazing.
[02:17:28.895 --> 02:17:30.617]  And he can only be commended for it.
[02:17:30.797 --> 02:17:33.379]  And all he's calling for is a real investigation.
[02:17:33.499 --> 02:17:36.522]  I go further at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:17:36.843 --> 02:17:38.925]  We lay out how it happened, what took place.
[02:17:38.965 --> 02:17:40.166]  And it's not just Charlie Sheen.
[02:17:40.366 --> 02:17:40.927]  I've interviewed...
[02:17:44.993 --> 02:17:45.813]  Come on, Bill.
[02:17:46.034 --> 02:17:47.855]  Two weeks ago, you were riding a bicycle.
[02:17:48.055 --> 02:17:51.218]  And today, you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[02:17:51.558 --> 02:17:52.119]  What did you do?
[02:17:52.219 --> 02:17:53.039]  Rob Bill Gates?
[02:17:53.139 --> 02:17:53.860]  No, John.
[02:17:53.940 --> 02:17:55.121]  I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[02:17:55.401 --> 02:18:00.906]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:18:01.206 --> 02:18:07.471]  That's where I learned how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[02:18:07.811 --> 02:18:10.013]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[02:18:10.314 --> 02:18:10.934]  And get this.
[02:18:11.114 --> 02:18:13.176]  They guarantee my success in writing.
[02:18:13.656 --> 02:18:17.118]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week.
[02:18:17.358 --> 02:18:17.779]  Whoa.
[02:18:18.159 --> 02:18:19.339]  What was that website again?
[02:18:19.440 --> 02:18:22.922]  It's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[02:18:23.222 --> 02:18:24.342]  Now write this down, John.
[02:18:24.482 --> 02:18:28.785]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[02:18:28.925 --> 02:18:29.505]  Thanks, Bill.

[02:18:31.387 --> 02:18:32.027]  Check, please.
[02:18:33.787 --> 02:18:35.289]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[02:18:35.749 --> 02:18:36.349]  Sure, John.

[02:18:43.095 --> 02:18:43.455]  Deal.

[02:19:46.013 --> 02:19:47.054]  The war on terrorism.
[02:19:47.394 --> 02:19:50.175]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:19:50.435 --> 02:19:54.598]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:19:55.018 --> 02:19:55.838]  So what do you do?
[02:19:56.158 --> 02:20:00.721]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:20:01.221 --> 02:20:03.342]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:20:03.843 --> 02:20:18.532]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[02:20:38.203 --> 02:20:42.145]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:20:44.126 --> 02:20:46.127]  Gee, honey, those new sandals look great on you.
[02:20:46.387 --> 02:20:48.649]  And look, they show off my new toenails, too.
[02:20:48.929 --> 02:20:49.629]  New toenails?
[02:20:49.989 --> 02:20:50.990]  What happened to the old ones?
[02:20:51.970 --> 02:20:54.652]  Well, they're not really new, just clear and healthy looking.
[02:20:55.194 --> 02:20:56.596]  Remember how embarrassed I was?
[02:20:56.616 --> 02:20:59.420]  They were so discolored, really awful looking.
[02:20:59.640 --> 02:21:01.002]  Well, they sure look clear now.
[02:21:01.022 --> 02:21:03.144]  Gosh, I wish I could wear sandals again.
[02:21:03.304 --> 02:21:04.666]  My toenails are a disaster.
[02:21:04.706 --> 02:21:07.510]  Look, this one looks white, and that one's thick and yellow.
[02:21:07.530 --> 02:21:08.952]  Well, here's my secret.
[02:21:09.543 --> 02:21:10.583]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:21:11.063 --> 02:21:15.124]  It clears out yellowing keratin debris, the source of nail discoloration.
[02:21:15.844 --> 02:21:16.745]  Ah, so that's it.
[02:21:16.985 --> 02:21:19.545]  I've got ugly keratin debris built up under my nails.
[02:21:19.805 --> 02:21:21.466]  And Non-X Nail Gel gets rid of it.
[02:21:21.946 --> 02:21:25.026]  Now, you'll need to use it every day, but clear nails are worth it.
[02:21:25.407 --> 02:21:25.987]  You bet.
[02:21:26.187 --> 02:21:30.288]  You know, when we go to the beach this summer, my toenails are going to look just as good as yours do.
[02:21:30.428 --> 02:21:31.868]  Thanks to Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:21:32.348 --> 02:21:35.351]  Nunnex Nail Gel for clear, healthy-looking nails.
[02:21:35.711 --> 02:21:42.116]  Now at Walgreens, Rite Aid, Eckerd, Brooks, Longs, Duane Reade, and Walmart in the foot care section.
[02:21:45.218 --> 02:21:56.467]  Remember Neil Young?
[02:21:58.019 --> 02:22:00.180]  Oh, he was the neocon darling.
[02:22:00.721 --> 02:22:06.084]  Within a couple weeks of 9-11, he had let's roll out by in the 9-11 fable.
[02:22:07.084 --> 02:22:10.106]  And I'm told from good sources he knows the truth about 9-11 now.
[02:22:10.126 --> 02:22:15.669]  And he's saying Bush needs to be impeached for being a liar, for the spying, for the Patriot Act.
[02:22:16.790 --> 02:22:20.852]  I saw him in a CNN interview saying that Bush is doing nothing even if terrorism's real.
[02:22:20.872 --> 02:22:21.992]  He's just taking our freedoms.
[02:22:22.493 --> 02:22:23.333]  That's exactly right.
[02:22:23.373 --> 02:22:26.595]  So now Neil Young's come out with a new album called
[02:22:27.446 --> 02:22:32.390]  And one of the songs is Impeach President Bush, and you ought to read these lyrics.
[02:22:32.410 --> 02:22:33.471]  In fact, let's just do it together.
[02:22:33.811 --> 02:22:42.898]  Let's impeach the president for lying, misleading our country into war, abusing all the power that we gave him, and shipping all our money out the door.
[02:22:42.918 --> 02:22:47.742]  I mean, those are the type of things that Neil Young is saying and doing now.
[02:22:49.243 --> 02:22:50.784]  And you can only commend his courage.
[02:22:50.824 --> 02:22:53.847]  I'm sure the tabloids will be attacking him now.
[02:22:55.217 --> 02:23:07.365]  Claiming he visits bad internet sites, or claiming he thinks vaccines are bad, or claiming that he thinks 9-11... In fact, he said 9-11 doesn't belong to Bush, and Bush needs to quit using it to destroy American freedom.
[02:23:09.286 --> 02:23:16.571]  So Steve Watson did a good article this weekend, God bless Neil Young, but why does it take a 60-year-old Canadian musician to generate political activism in America?
[02:23:17.592 --> 02:23:21.054]  Now, at the same time, CIA officer...
[02:23:22.270 --> 02:23:22.791]  We're good to go.
[02:23:22.851 --> 02:23:23.412]  We're good to go.
[02:23:23.452 --> 02:23:24.092]  We're good to go.
[02:23:42.961 --> 02:23:43.962]  But it's okay when he does it.
[02:23:43.982 --> 02:23:45.863]  But now a lady leaks criminal activity.
[02:23:46.244 --> 02:23:48.025]  You know, you have to read deep into these articles.
[02:23:48.045 --> 02:23:49.526]  Most of the articles, I've got what?
[02:23:49.846 --> 02:24:12.363]  One, two, three, four, five, six articles when this broke Friday through the weekend on this CIA high-level officer agent who leaked to the Washington Post that there are these secret rendition torture sites where they take citizens of America, you name it, and they torture them and many of them die.
[02:24:13.129 --> 02:24:14.510]  They torture them in Tajikistan.
[02:24:14.530 --> 02:24:15.771]  They torture them in Germany.
[02:24:15.791 --> 02:24:19.193]  They torture them in former areas of the former Soviet Eastern Bloc.
[02:24:20.254 --> 02:24:21.675]  They torture them all over the place.
[02:24:22.276 --> 02:24:22.656]  Okay?
[02:24:24.097 --> 02:24:24.918]  Totally illegal.
[02:24:25.318 --> 02:24:26.158]  Totally criminal.
[02:24:27.339 --> 02:24:42.050]  And by law, example, if you work at the CIA and you see someone, your boss, or someone under you stealing money, say, or you see them stealing computers, office computers, or you see them rape their secretary on the desk,
[02:24:43.010 --> 02:24:44.030]  You know, you're up there at 2 a.m.
[02:24:44.050 --> 02:24:44.850]  getting some documents.
[02:24:44.890 --> 02:24:45.951]  You didn't finish a project.
[02:24:46.291 --> 02:24:46.891]  You're up there.
[02:24:47.371 --> 02:24:48.631]  You see the rape going on.
[02:24:49.351 --> 02:24:50.332]  You call the police.
[02:24:50.492 --> 02:24:51.152]  Oh, you leaked.
[02:24:51.612 --> 02:24:52.292]  You're arrested.
[02:24:53.292 --> 02:25:00.454]  Or let's say CIA security detail, this is all hypothetical, doesn't let the police in when you report the rape and she reports the rape.
[02:25:01.054 --> 02:25:04.734]  And then you go to the media about it and then you get fired and then arrested.
[02:25:07.595 --> 02:25:11.896]  I mean, understand, this Falun Gong practitioner, this doctor, this transplantation doctor...
[02:25:12.759 --> 02:25:14.781]  Stands up and says, you need to quit doing what you're doing.
[02:25:15.641 --> 02:25:17.963]  The Communist Party's days are numbered if you keep doing this.
[02:25:18.524 --> 02:25:20.505]  She is now facing terrorism charges.
[02:25:20.545 --> 02:25:25.469]  Those are Patriot Act terrorism charges of six months to a year in federal prison for intimidating a foreign official.
[02:25:25.749 --> 02:25:26.730]  That's in the new Patriot Act.
[02:25:26.750 --> 02:25:27.651]  That's where that comes from.
[02:25:28.471 --> 02:25:31.834]  Headlines should be Patriot Act used on Falun Gong practitioner.
[02:25:32.463 --> 02:25:48.109]  Peaceful group, known for their maintenance piece, non-violence, never been violent, incredibly crystal record, the commie Chinese murder, Christians, Buddhists, Falun Gong, whoever, farmers, they want your property, whatever, she's bad, she's now facing prison time.
[02:25:48.489 --> 02:25:53.491]  This CIA agent facing prison time for reporting on crimes.
[02:25:55.931 --> 02:26:02.436]  And I hear these sniveling neocons on talk radio saying that she deserves to go to prison.
[02:26:02.496 --> 02:26:10.522]  The Chinese-American lady, the doctor, Wang Wing Wong, Dr. Wang Wing Wong faces all of this.
[02:26:10.542 --> 02:26:12.523]  This CIA agent, McCarthy, faces all of this.
[02:26:22.131 --> 02:26:31.378]  Meanwhile, Bush has his Attorney General, when he's Chief Counsel at the White House, and his Secretary of Defense write memos saying they can torture people to death.
[02:26:31.458 --> 02:26:32.779]  And they're getting false confessions.
[02:26:33.160 --> 02:26:34.701]  Former head of Delta Forces said that.
[02:26:34.741 --> 02:26:35.642]  It's all staged.
[02:26:36.202 --> 02:26:37.343]  The war on terror is fake.
[02:26:38.183 --> 02:26:40.025]  These aren't even real terrorists that are being tortured.
[02:26:40.185 --> 02:26:43.548]  And torture is not good on real terrorists either, because you become the terrorist.
[02:26:43.948 --> 02:26:46.510]  Joseph Mingola-style sexual torture.
[02:26:49.156 --> 02:26:59.819]  They go out, and then when their minions get caught doing this, Bush sends them to prison under military courts, under military court marshals and tribunals, when he gave the order.
[02:27:00.079 --> 02:27:00.859]  And it's admitted.
[02:27:01.659 --> 02:27:05.520]  It's admitted it's a felony to order the spying without a warrant.
[02:27:05.560 --> 02:27:05.980]  They do it.
[02:27:06.540 --> 02:27:09.081]  It's illegal to sign bills that didn't pass.
[02:27:09.141 --> 02:27:09.721]  Bush does it.
[02:27:11.585 --> 02:27:20.047]  It's illegal to have Dick Cheney running the purchasing for the Pentagon for companies that he owns part of, and his wife owns part of, Lockheed Martin Alliburton.
[02:27:21.067 --> 02:27:21.487]  They do it.
[02:27:22.467 --> 02:27:24.968]  And when they get caught, they say, we are above the law.
[02:27:25.008 --> 02:27:27.248]  They are forwarding that doctrine.
[02:27:28.508 --> 02:27:29.208]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:34.529 --> 02:27:35.450]  We're on the march.
[02:27:35.930 --> 02:27:37.430]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.431 --> 02:27:41.212]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:44.994 --> 02:27:51.877]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[02:27:52.017 --> 02:28:04.902]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[02:28:05.162 --> 02:28:05.823]  We're good to go.
[02:28:26.203 --> 02:28:27.305]  That's M-A-N-G-O-S-T-E-E-N market.com.
[02:28:27.325 --> 02:28:27.725]  Call 888-203-6633 today.
[02:28:45.203 --> 02:28:49.105]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:28:49.325 --> 02:28:54.767]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:28:55.047 --> 02:29:05.412]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:29:05.572 --> 02:29:09.914]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:29:10.114 --> 02:29:18.477]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[02:29:18.737 --> 02:29:25.060]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[02:29:25.200 --> 02:29:25.440]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:29:45.336 --> 02:29:45.916]  We're good to go.
[02:30:07.831 --> 02:30:08.912]  We're good to go.
[02:30:28.510 --> 02:30:28.970]  That's 888-216-2461.
[02:30:45.248 --> 02:30:49.910]  And on Friday I stood up and said, I don't appreciate the speculation about Don Rumsfeld.
[02:30:49.950 --> 02:30:51.050]  He's doing a fine job.
[02:30:51.090 --> 02:30:52.110]  I strongly support him.
[02:30:52.250 --> 02:30:58.353]  But what do you say to critics who believe that you're ignoring the advice of retired generals, military commanders, who say that there needs to be a change?
[02:31:14.967 --> 02:31:36.886]  I am me and Rummy's he and Reg is free and we are all together See the world run when Dick shoots his gun, see how I lie I'm lying Sitting on my own brain Waiting for the end of days
[02:31:39.088 --> 02:31:44.834]  Corporation profits, bloody oil money, I'm above the law and I'll decide what's right or wrong.
[02:31:46.755 --> 02:31:48.137]  I am the egghead.
[02:31:49.358 --> 02:31:50.899]  I'm the commander.
[02:31:52.080 --> 02:31:53.622]  I'm the decider.
[02:31:54.002 --> 02:32:00.729]  Cuckoo, ca-choo, Baghdad city, policemen sitting, pretty little targets in a row.
[02:32:04.065 --> 02:32:09.709]  I'm lying I'm lying I'm lying I'm lying Shall I take the Tony up?
[02:32:09.729 --> 02:32:10.109]  Imaginary WMDs
[02:32:33.232 --> 02:32:42.840]  I'm the decider, and I decide what is best, and what's best is for Don Rumsfeld to remain as the Secretary of Defense.
[02:32:42.920 --> 02:32:47.864]  Sitting in a White House garden, talking to the Lord.
[02:33:02.148 --> 02:33:05.991]  But my thoughts would be busy, busy hatching if I only had a brain.
[02:33:06.152 --> 02:33:07.533]  I am really head.
[02:33:08.093 --> 02:33:09.935]  I'm a commander.
[02:33:13.148 --> 02:33:13.608]  We're good to go.
[02:33:13.628 --> 02:33:13.768]  I think?
[02:33:39.981 --> 02:33:40.861]  The real baby Jesus.
[02:33:40.881 --> 02:33:44.643]  The only thing I don't like about it is, again, they claim Bush is a Christian.
[02:33:44.703 --> 02:33:46.084]  Bush isn't really a Christian.
[02:33:46.124 --> 02:33:47.004]  He's a Satanist.
[02:33:47.445 --> 02:33:48.965]  That's mainstream news, folks.
[02:33:49.265 --> 02:33:51.226]  If you don't know about that, get my film, The Order of Death.
[02:33:51.987 --> 02:34:04.012]  Speaking of the spin, I told you early last week, when all these generals were going public, that I heard spin on national talk radio and in the news, that, oh my gosh, it's a police state.
[02:34:04.492 --> 02:34:07.834]  You're not supposed to have the military involved in America's daily affairs.
[02:34:08.573 --> 02:34:18.156]  And I was going, I said, wow, what's, wow, they're talking about, and then they went, yeah, having these generals speak out against Bush is against the law, posse commentatus.
[02:34:19.476 --> 02:34:19.816]  What?
[02:34:20.296 --> 02:34:23.137]  Retired generals can say whatever they want politically.
[02:34:23.157 --> 02:34:27.118]  That's why they say Colin Powell, Secretary of State, that's why he ought to run for president, they say.
[02:34:27.788 --> 02:34:29.128]  I mean, what are you talking about?
[02:34:29.228 --> 02:34:30.649]  Eisenhower becoming president.
[02:34:31.189 --> 02:34:32.609]  Andrew Jackson was a general.
[02:34:32.629 --> 02:34:33.809]  I mean, what does that mean?
[02:34:34.209 --> 02:34:46.652]  Bush is getting rid of Posse Comitatus, saying he wants to get rid of it, having urban warfare drills everywhere in the country to condition us for a military takeover, brainwashing the military, saying he wants to do things domestically with them.
[02:34:47.152 --> 02:34:53.113]  All of this is happening, and then they spin it into, oh, we shouldn't have these generals going public.
[02:34:53.913 --> 02:34:57.474]  Gerald Ford troubled by former General Rumsfeld complaints.
[02:34:58.254 --> 02:34:58.614]  AP.
[02:34:58.654 --> 02:34:59.535]  This came out Saturday.
[02:35:01.016 --> 02:35:01.916]  Now listen to that headline.
[02:35:03.257 --> 02:35:08.420]  Gerald Ford, former President Gerald Ford, troubled by former General Rumsfeld complaints.
[02:35:09.200 --> 02:35:11.041]  And this must be a script, because he says the same thing.
[02:35:11.061 --> 02:35:11.361]  Listen.
[02:35:12.662 --> 02:35:14.483]  Ranchero, California.
[02:35:14.583 --> 02:35:21.427]  Former President Ford said Friday he is troubled by the efforts of retired generals to force the ouster of Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld.
[02:35:21.587 --> 02:35:26.409]  Ford, who appointed Rumsfeld as White House Chief of Staff and then chose him to Defense Secretary.
[02:35:26.729 --> 02:35:27.590]  Yeah, he's been there before.
[02:35:28.240 --> 02:35:33.383]  During his administration, said in a statement that President Bush was right to keep Rumsfeld in his post.
[02:35:33.443 --> 02:35:39.226]  The statement was released by spokeswoman Penny Circle as Bush arrived in California for the weekend.
[02:35:39.266 --> 02:35:43.849]  Ford 92 said the decision on keeping Rumsfeld is the President's alone.
[02:35:44.189 --> 02:35:56.456]  Quote, allowing retired generals to dictate our country's policies and its leadership would be a dangerous precedent that would severely undermine our country's long tradition of civilian control of the military, Ford said.
[02:35:57.364 --> 02:35:58.385]  What do you mean?
[02:35:58.665 --> 02:35:59.926]  They are civilians.
[02:36:00.426 --> 02:36:16.476]  The White House, it turned out, was paying almost half a million dollars a year, and still is, to have former General Tommy Franks trot all over TV, radio, and print saying how great the war is and how great the police state is and, gee, we're going to have to have martial law soon.
[02:36:17.156 --> 02:36:21.239]  Bush's paid generals are running around saying we need martial law and it's coming.
[02:36:21.799 --> 02:36:24.601]  Meanwhile, all these other prominent generals who've been in Iraq...
[02:36:26.283 --> 02:36:32.747]  From Zinni to Karpinski, you name it, are going public saying we're in deep trouble and this whole thing's a fraud.
[02:36:33.787 --> 02:36:50.778]  And then their spin is, quote, it would discourage civilian leaders and the Defense Department from having frank and candid exchanges with military officers and today at a time of war, such an effort sends exactly the wrong message to both our troops deployed abroad and our enemies who are watching for signs of weakness or self-doubt.
[02:36:51.418 --> 02:36:54.820]  Ford suggested that the issue stem from Bush's efforts to change the military.
[02:36:55.640 --> 02:37:06.384]  He knew that Don, who had been in the job before, was extremely well suited to take on the challenge to contend with the bureaucracy that is built in the resistance to change, like butchering the Bill of Rights and having cribs on the streets.
[02:37:06.404 --> 02:37:08.965]  Yes, you're right, the generals don't like that.
[02:37:09.525 --> 02:37:17.108]  The President knew that successfully carrying out these missions against stiff resistance takes someone with a certain amount of steel, Ford said.
[02:37:17.488 --> 02:37:21.830]  Ford and his wife Betty, who lived in Ranchero Mirage since leaving the White House in 1977.
[02:37:21.870 --> 02:37:21.950]  Okay.
[02:37:21.970 --> 02:37:22.030]  Now,
[02:37:26.590 --> 02:37:29.313]  What is this transformation of the military they're talking about?
[02:37:30.314 --> 02:37:46.009]  Taking a large portion, in fact a bulk of the force, not having the big aircraft carriers and the bombers to fight China or Russia, is there even a threat, which China is threatening to nuke us on a daily basis, exaggeration, a monthly basis, so we should be concerned about that.
[02:37:46.627 --> 02:37:53.472]  They're going from that force to rapid reaction forces to go blow up capitals and install dictators.
[02:37:54.052 --> 02:37:59.896]  But more than that, I have the Washington Post here, of course with a glowing endorsement of it.
[02:38:01.217 --> 02:38:02.298]  I have it right here.
[02:38:03.059 --> 02:38:06.781]  Headline, New plan for cease fighting terrorism beyond war zones.
[02:38:06.821 --> 02:38:07.562]  And guess what it says?
[02:38:09.043 --> 02:38:15.968]  Domestically, internationally, rapid reaction, expanded Delta Force, Navy SEAL type units, entire...
[02:38:16.966 --> 02:38:34.243]  Brigades, entire force structures of special forces out of Fort Bragg, Army, Navy, Air Force Marines, Force Recon, to literally black bag and do James Bond type ops everywhere, blowing things up, shooting people, killing people, kidnapping, all of it.
[02:38:34.584 --> 02:38:37.667]  Which is what they said they want to do, they've been trying to do for decades.
[02:38:38.394 --> 02:38:46.260]  Again, in the late 80s, they had secret Marine Corps squads in Virginia and California running around confiscating gun owners' guns and raiding gun shops.
[02:38:46.320 --> 02:38:47.280]  I have that in Road to Tyranny.
[02:38:49.022 --> 02:38:58.628]  Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has approved the military's most ambitious plan yet to fight terrorism around the world and retaliate more rapidly and decisively in the case of another major terrorist attack on the United States, according to defense officials.
[02:38:59.569 --> 02:39:02.571]  So that means when the globalists blow something up, the special forces attack instantly.
[02:39:03.382 --> 02:39:09.872]  The long-awaited campaign plan for a global war on terror, as well as two... You see, the long-awaited campaign plan.
[02:39:09.892 --> 02:39:11.575]  See, they haven't even launched the real war yet.
[02:39:12.015 --> 02:39:14.059]  The Pentagon's new map, 64 countries.
[02:39:14.599 --> 02:39:16.643]  It was 66, but they've invaded two.
[02:39:17.791 --> 02:39:32.533]  The long-awaited campaign plan for the global war on terrorism, as well as two subordinate plans, also approved in the past month by Rumsfeld, are considered the Pentagon's highest priority, according to officials familiar with the three documents who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about them publicly.
[02:39:32.553 --> 02:39:33.975]  Don't worry, they'll be arrested, I'm sure.
[02:39:37.040 --> 02:39:48.275]  Details of the plans are secret, but in general they envision a significantly expanded role for the military and in particular a growing force of elite special operations crews in continuous operations to combat terrorism outside the war zones.
[02:39:48.355 --> 02:39:48.595]  See?
[02:39:49.056 --> 02:39:50.418]  Outside war zones.
[02:39:51.038 --> 02:39:52.480]  Such as Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:39:52.520 --> 02:39:52.901]  Developed.
[02:39:53.550 --> 02:40:05.986]  Over about three years by the Special Operations Command, or SOCOM, in Tampa, the plan reflects a beefing up of the Pentagon's involvement in domains traditionally handled by Central Intelligence Agency and State Department.
[02:40:06.026 --> 02:40:06.967]  And this is domestic.
[02:40:06.987 --> 02:40:08.489]  We've got all the articles where it's leaked.
[02:40:09.190 --> 02:40:13.032]  Yeah, that's troops spying on war protesters, land rights activists.
[02:40:13.512 --> 02:40:25.398]  These troops go get in FEMA uniforms and go give police manuals saying all Christians are terrorists, all homeschoolers are terrorists, all property rights activists are terrorists, must be put in camps or exterminated.
[02:40:26.478 --> 02:40:27.099]  You think I'm joking?
[02:40:27.119 --> 02:40:28.259]  That's mainstream news, by the way.
[02:40:29.080 --> 02:40:29.840]  We have the manuals.
[02:40:31.042 --> 02:40:32.244]  That's who teaches these classes.
[02:40:32.785 --> 02:40:35.510]  These are going to be literal murder squads running every city.
[02:40:35.991 --> 02:40:39.276]  With that death squad founder, Negroponte, at the top of it.
[02:40:39.337 --> 02:40:41.180]  I mean, this is bone chilling.
[02:40:45.011 --> 02:40:50.933]  For example, Southcom has dispatched small teams of Green Berets and other special forces groups to U.S.
[02:40:50.993 --> 02:41:01.018]  embassies in about 20 countries in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Latin America, where they do operational planning and intelligence gathering to enhance the ability to conduct military operations where the United States is not at war.
[02:41:01.498 --> 02:41:02.598]  They're mainly here, folks.
[02:41:04.159 --> 02:41:10.522]  And they're at public schools, like down there at the elementary school that we covered and got video of in San Antonio.
[02:41:10.562 --> 02:41:11.242]  They're all over the place.
[02:41:13.078 --> 02:41:14.820]  Disciplining the children.
[02:41:14.840 --> 02:41:21.205]  Remember the Marines taking over Hobbs Middle School in Pensacola saying that Bill Clinton wants you to know what martial law is like?
[02:41:21.505 --> 02:41:22.386]  Front page of the paper.
[02:41:23.026 --> 02:41:24.848]  Pointing guns at crying elementary students.
[02:41:25.791 --> 02:41:27.272]  That's all conditioning for the takeover.
[02:41:27.653 --> 02:41:31.656]  Well, the executive just calls and tells the ambassador... Oh my gosh.
[02:41:51.287 --> 02:41:55.869]  Overall, the plans underscore Rumsfeld's conviction that since September 11th, terrorist attacks of the U.S.
[02:41:55.909 --> 02:42:05.013]  military might expand its mission beyond 20th century conventional warfare by infantry tanks, ships, and fighting jets to fighting non-state groups that are above all difficult to find.
[02:42:05.093 --> 02:42:06.433]  So, difficult to find.
[02:42:06.453 --> 02:42:07.874]  That's us, the American people.
[02:42:09.614 --> 02:42:15.897]  The plans each run over 100 pages and cover a wide range of overt and clandestine military activities such as a manhunting...
[02:42:16.602 --> 02:42:20.885]  And this is the deal they signed three years ago with Canada and Mexico to quote Associated Press,
[02:42:40.615 --> 02:42:48.065]  Mexican and Canadian troops will work in joint task forces inside the continental United States to, quote, deal with emergencies and deal with American terrorists.
[02:42:48.926 --> 02:42:49.747]  That's in Road to Tyranny.
[02:42:50.468 --> 02:42:51.930]  It's also in Masters of Terror.
[02:42:53.675 --> 02:42:55.676]  I guess it was almost five years ago.
[02:42:55.776 --> 02:42:57.456]  My gosh, time's flying by here.
[02:42:57.956 --> 02:43:12.021]  The main campaign plan sets priorities, allocates resources such as manpower and funding, and coordinates operations among regional military commands to implement the Pentagon's broader national military strategic plan for the war on terrorism.
[02:43:12.081 --> 02:43:20.884]  Now, this also takes out, already special forces can land on an aircraft carrier and order a flag admiral around.
[02:43:20.904 --> 02:43:23.125]  An admiral of the blue.
[02:43:24.935 --> 02:43:48.589]  They can already, and the military hates this, and so you can have suits, you know, guys in white business shirts back in Laneley and Fort Meade and wherever they want to be, now having their own giant armies and then merging those with foreign troops and merging those with private mercenaries and literally just cutting the classical military structure out of the loop.
[02:43:49.640 --> 02:43:57.163]  Because they have had trouble getting these generals to be part of the massive gun confiscation drills, takeover drills.
[02:43:57.623 --> 02:44:10.448]  The Marines have been under their control for so long, really the last hundred years, as the Marine Corps Commandant has said, and of course then Spenley Butler said, Marine Corps General, for gunboat diplomacy.
[02:44:10.528 --> 02:44:16.510]  So it's just our military being totally given over to private interest and our journey into the depths of tyranny being complete.
[02:44:19.508 --> 02:44:20.728]  And it goes on and on.
[02:44:22.449 --> 02:44:23.609]  This is so scary.
[02:44:26.729 --> 02:44:28.590]  I just read a page and a half.
[02:44:28.630 --> 02:44:29.510]  There's two more pages.
[02:44:29.590 --> 02:44:30.230]  Just go read it.
[02:44:30.870 --> 02:44:33.131]  On Infowars.com, on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:44:34.931 --> 02:44:38.112]  Strangely enough, Yahoo put a story out on this yesterday and then pulled it.
[02:44:38.232 --> 02:44:39.052]  It had even more.
[02:44:39.432 --> 02:44:41.552]  We got a screenshot of it because I was thinking about putting it in the film.
[02:44:41.572 --> 02:44:42.993]  We happened to be up there working at the time.
[02:44:43.353 --> 02:44:45.153]  And it was pulled within an hour and disappeared.
[02:44:46.433 --> 02:44:49.194]  This is the Washington Post and it's more of a whitewash.
[02:44:50.333 --> 02:44:52.473]  But the whitewash is bad enough.
[02:44:52.513 --> 02:44:55.694]  This is like Hitler taking control of the military through the SS.
[02:44:58.314 --> 02:44:59.715]  And so it's the same story.
[02:45:01.315 --> 02:45:03.355]  Meanwhile, I have articles like this one.
[02:45:03.395 --> 02:45:05.776]  Virginia apologizes to nurse who wrote letter.
[02:45:05.796 --> 02:45:08.476]  This is out of the Tribune.
[02:45:08.876 --> 02:45:13.117]  Maggie Shepard, an Albuquerque Veterans Affairs nurse, has received a bit of a vindication.
[02:45:13.817 --> 02:45:15.838]  She sought for wrongly being accused of sedition.
[02:45:16.318 --> 02:45:18.238]  They were preparing charges and to arrest her.
[02:45:19.381 --> 02:45:21.783]  She faced, of course, life in prison or execution.
[02:45:22.464 --> 02:45:23.725]  I think I would add that for you.
[02:45:25.747 --> 02:45:30.011]  An admission from a top official that the agency was wrong, plus a private apology from her boss.
[02:45:30.151 --> 02:45:32.353]  They're like, oh, no, no, that comes later.
[02:45:32.373 --> 02:45:33.714]  We can't do that now and scare them.
[02:45:34.575 --> 02:45:43.483]  The admission, which was made public by the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico, comes in a letter dated March 14th from Veterans Affairs Secretary R. James Nelson to the U.S.
[02:45:43.523 --> 02:45:45.025]  Senator Jeff Bingham.
[02:45:46.411 --> 02:45:47.612]  This just came out last week.
[02:45:47.672 --> 02:45:59.699]  In regards to a letter to the editor written by psychiatric nurse Laura Berg that was published in September in a local alternative newspaper in Albuquerque, the Albi.
[02:46:00.279 --> 02:46:06.143]  In a letter, Berg criticized the federal government on several issues including its actions in Iraq and the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.
[02:46:06.443 --> 02:46:11.786]  Quote, I am furious with the tragically misplaced priorities and criminal negligence of this government, she wrote.
[02:46:13.032 --> 02:46:15.053]  Berg identified herself as a VA nurse in a letter.
[02:46:15.093 --> 02:46:26.738]  Within weeks of her letter's publication, Berg said Mel Hooker, Veterans Affairs Medical Center Human Resources Chief and other staff, confiscated her work computer and later told her she was being investigated for possible sedition charges.
[02:46:28.579 --> 02:46:34.622]  And they went to the higher-ups and were about to charge her with it, and then it blew up in their face.
[02:46:34.642 --> 02:46:36.903]  See, that's what America's about.
[02:46:37.883 --> 02:46:41.925]  Gun confiscation, open borders, massive government, doubling the BATF,
[02:46:43.306 --> 02:46:58.409]  Demonizing homeschoolers, demonizing everybody, funding the Liberty Conquistas as a foreign force to break down the country, massive looting and stealing by select agencies and people that control them.
[02:47:00.330 --> 02:47:01.970]  It's just unspeakable.
[02:47:03.070 --> 02:47:07.371]  I'll get into some Iran news and some other issues when we get back in the final segment.
[02:47:07.431 --> 02:47:10.692]  I didn't take a lot of calls today just because there's been so much news.
[02:47:11.372 --> 02:47:12.232]  I'll take some tomorrow.
[02:47:13.897 --> 02:47:18.779]  Plus, we don't screen calls, and sometimes it just gets... I don't know how to describe it.
[02:47:18.859 --> 02:47:22.400]  People call up and think everybody knows what they're talking about, and it's like a private discussion.
[02:47:24.801 --> 02:47:27.142]  My private discussion is like I'm talking on the telephone with somebody.
[02:47:28.162 --> 02:47:28.882]  And I don't know.
[02:47:28.942 --> 02:47:31.223]  I'm not going to start screening the calls at the same time, folks.
[02:47:33.424 --> 02:47:35.185]  I just don't understand what you're talking about.
[02:47:36.405 --> 02:47:38.286]  Not that you're stupid or don't have a good point.
[02:47:38.366 --> 02:47:41.327]  It's that you jump into something so complex right off the bat,
[02:47:42.546 --> 02:47:47.488]  And start just saying a bunch of names about what's going on at some medical center or some university.
[02:47:48.809 --> 02:47:49.189]  I don't know.
[02:47:49.789 --> 02:47:50.850]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[02:47:52.471 --> 02:47:52.991]  I just can't.
[02:47:55.172 --> 02:47:57.593]  We'll go to break here, and we'll come back.
[02:47:57.633 --> 02:48:03.296]  And I'll briefly, I'm going to spend about 60 seconds on it, plug my videos and tell you about PrisonPlanet.tv and some other things.
[02:48:03.596 --> 02:48:04.576]  So be ready with a pen and paper.
[02:48:05.357 --> 02:48:08.438]  And then we'll hit a few final news articles and wrap up this transmission.
[02:48:10.822 --> 02:48:12.062]  By the way, I'm working on a new film.
[02:48:12.102 --> 02:48:12.702]  It's almost done.
[02:48:12.722 --> 02:48:13.743]  I don't even know the name of it yet.
[02:48:13.763 --> 02:48:14.823]  I don't even know what to call it.
[02:48:16.583 --> 02:48:17.684]  So I'll be working on that today.
[02:48:17.724 --> 02:48:19.904]  And there's a lot of other big announcements we're going to be making this week.
[02:48:20.664 --> 02:48:21.885]  So definitely want to join us for that.
[02:48:23.945 --> 02:48:29.587]  And the good news is these crooks are being exposed.
[02:48:30.547 --> 02:48:33.548]  The bad news is they get exposed and the criminality just goes on and on.
[02:48:35.368 --> 02:48:38.409]  I mean, we have White House officials saying they can torture children in front of their parents.
[02:48:39.022 --> 02:48:40.884]  I mean, I don't have to explain to people why that's bad.
[02:48:45.548 --> 02:48:48.390]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:48.651 --> 02:48:50.232]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:50.572 --> 02:48:55.257]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:55.597 --> 02:49:02.323]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:49:02.643 --> 02:49:04.623]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:04.824 --> 02:49:07.664]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:07.764 --> 02:49:12.425]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:12.625 --> 02:49:17.006]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:17.266 --> 02:49:24.488]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:24.748 --> 02:49:27.169]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:49:27.329 --> 02:49:29.069]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:49:44.918 --> 02:49:45.538]  Hello, folks.
[02:49:45.638 --> 02:49:46.539]  Alex Jones here.
[02:49:46.679 --> 02:49:50.782]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:49:50.922 --> 02:49:53.803]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:49:53.883 --> 02:50:00.608]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:50:00.788 --> 02:50:03.789]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:50:03.990 --> 02:50:06.371]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:50:06.511 --> 02:50:11.234]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove
[02:50:11.394 --> 02:50:25.983]  Try Halo Methanes and volatile organic elements such as Aptazine, Benzene, Chloride, and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum aren't extracted.
[02:50:26.124 --> 02:50:33.608]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:51:44.676 --> 02:51:50.298]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:51.979 --> 02:51:58.801]  Folks, the CIA released that ridiculous fat bin Laden four years ago, the fat guy in the room.
[02:51:58.861 --> 02:52:00.102]  They did voice prints on it.
[02:52:00.808 --> 02:52:04.949]  Just like you can have voice print to get into your telephone or voice print to get into your house or car.
[02:52:05.530 --> 02:52:05.650]  It's 100%.
[02:52:05.790 --> 02:52:10.611]  They took real bin Laden voice, created a voice key with it, tested the other voice.
[02:52:10.651 --> 02:52:11.571]  It wasn't bin Laden.
[02:52:12.112 --> 02:52:17.373]  Then linguists listened to it, and it was someone who'd lived in the U.S.
[02:52:17.393 --> 02:52:22.695]  for a long time, an Americanized, you know, Arabic, Saudi Arabian.
[02:52:24.476 --> 02:52:25.036]  And they knew that.
[02:52:25.076 --> 02:52:26.376]  The government knew it, but said it was real.
[02:52:27.617 --> 02:52:28.697]  And obviously they produced it.
[02:52:29.788 --> 02:52:36.372]  And they've also, over and over again, will release re-edited old videos, four-, five-, six-year-old videos, depending on the video.
[02:52:37.072 --> 02:52:39.814]  Al Jazeera will release it, and for a week it's called the Nubin Laden tape.
[02:52:39.874 --> 02:52:41.675]  It'll be a quiet retraction in the back of the paper.
[02:52:41.715 --> 02:52:44.077]  You'll see it, probably, if you read, if you look.
[02:52:44.097 --> 02:52:45.878]  And it'll say, oh, that was an old tape.
[02:52:46.778 --> 02:52:48.399]  Then a new Al Qaeda tape.
[02:52:48.619 --> 02:52:50.240]  Oh, my gosh, he's going to get us any minute.
[02:52:50.860 --> 02:52:53.242]  See, we should give up all of our rights or Al Qaeda's going to get us.
[02:52:56.337 --> 02:52:58.058]  And then there's this other World Net Daily article.
[02:52:58.118 --> 02:53:00.600]  Islamists protest in New York mushroom cloud on way.
[02:53:01.020 --> 02:53:04.522]  Rally against Israeli consulate features pictures of Muslim flags flying over White House.
[02:53:04.882 --> 02:53:07.484]  It's a Muslim group well-known to be connected to MI6.
[02:53:07.944 --> 02:53:09.165]  Making a whole film about this.
[02:53:12.387 --> 02:53:16.549]  And they... It's just so staged.
[02:53:16.569 --> 02:53:19.391]  You know, they have these fake Muslim groups go out and do this to scare everybody.
[02:53:20.472 --> 02:53:22.173]  Meanwhile, the government's saying, give up all your rights.
[02:53:22.193 --> 02:53:23.393]  We've got to have national ID cards.
[02:53:23.413 --> 02:53:24.314]  The terrorists are going to get us.
[02:53:25.220 --> 02:53:31.243]  And the Star-Telegram out of Fort Worth reports, evidence of work fraud untapped.
[02:53:32.963 --> 02:53:44.948]  And it admits that there are, you know, not just the 1,000 illegals that are arrested, there are tens of millions of people using fake or false or duplicate Social Security numbers, and the government doesn't enforce it.
[02:53:46.289 --> 02:53:52.591]  Now, you give a fake Social Security, if you're a Hispanic American or a white guy, a black guy, an Asian, you're not going to get away with it.
[02:53:52.611 --> 02:53:54.032]  But if you're an illegal alien, you're fine.
[02:53:54.835 --> 02:54:02.897]  Two federal agencies are refusing to turn over a mountain of evidence that investigators could use to indict the nation's burgeoning workforce of illegal immigrants and firms that employ them.
[02:54:02.977 --> 02:54:03.197]  See?
[02:54:04.318 --> 02:54:16.081]  Last week, immigration authorities trumpeted the arrest of nearly 1,200 illegal workers in a massive sting on a single company, but they acknowledged that they relied on confidential informants and an unsolicited tip.
[02:54:17.121 --> 02:54:18.702]  It didn't have to be that hard.
[02:54:18.742 --> 02:54:23.123]  And it goes on to say, the Internal Revenue Service and the Social Security Administration routinely collect information
[02:54:23.684 --> 02:54:31.286]  Strong evidence of potential workplace crimes, including the names and addresses of millions of people who are using bogus social security numbers, their wage records, and identities of those that are hired.
[02:54:31.526 --> 02:54:34.667]  But they keep those facts secret and refuse to give it to other federal agencies.
[02:54:34.987 --> 02:54:35.967]  Unless you're a citizen.
[02:54:39.148 --> 02:54:40.989]  And I should have thought of this three hours ago.
[02:54:41.009 --> 02:54:42.289]  We've had internet problems today.
[02:54:42.329 --> 02:54:44.970]  And do you guys ever think to give a phone feed to WWCR?
[02:54:46.110 --> 02:54:47.570]  Did we do that today or nah?
[02:54:48.431 --> 02:54:48.911]  Probably not.
[02:54:48.931 --> 02:54:49.951]  Fine.
[02:54:51.288 --> 02:54:52.949]  I think I'm going to take a few days off, folks.
[02:54:54.851 --> 02:54:56.452]  So, vacandios, as they say.
[02:54:57.533 --> 02:55:05.519]  If you want my documentary films, you can go to InfoWars.com to get them.
[02:55:07.040 --> 02:55:11.544]  And they're important, and they're my wife's work, and there's a good chance I'll get killed or imprisoned for making them.
[02:55:11.584 --> 02:55:13.165]  So please make the films count.
[02:55:14.446 --> 02:55:15.467]  Please get them and make copies.
[02:55:15.487 --> 02:55:16.347]  They're having a big effect.
[02:55:16.387 --> 02:55:19.510]  Let's expose the people who carried out terror attacks against this country.
[02:55:20.447 --> 02:55:21.328]  Let's do that together.
[02:55:23.069 --> 02:55:25.851]  Let's stand up against these creatures.
[02:55:25.931 --> 02:55:26.491]  Help me do it.
[02:55:26.511 --> 02:55:29.674]  If you've already got copies of the films, please make copies of them and give them to people.

[02:56:12.475 --> 02:56:16.237]  I want to thank Charlie Sheen for being under massive attack and knowing this would happen when he did it.
[02:56:16.854 --> 02:56:17.555]  I want to thank everybody.
[02:56:18.155 --> 02:56:18.796]  All right, take care.
