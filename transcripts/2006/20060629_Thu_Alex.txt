[00:00:05.678 --> 00:00:06.318]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:08.039]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:09.860]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.321]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.081 --> 00:00:12.961]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.981 --> 00:00:17.283]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.824 --> 00:00:21.925]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:31.602]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:31.622 --> 00:00:32.564]  It is the 29th day of June 2006.
[00:00:32.604 --> 00:00:34.348]  A live Thursday edition.
[00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:41.109]  We're good to go.
[00:01:02.856 --> 00:01:06.421]  Whatever issue you'd like to discuss, you are welcome to join us.
[00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:26.187]  The new developments with protesters being snatched off the streets in Ottawa and being threatened to have their arms cut off.
[00:01:26.708 --> 00:01:28.350]  Big news on that.
[00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:34.177]  More news on the secret rendition and torture centers around the world.
[00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.972]  There are hundreds and hundreds of issues you're welcome to call in about.
[00:01:38.332 --> 00:01:51.862]  The open borders, Bush still pushing for a total amnesty plan, the American Union, the super NAFTA highway that I could look at clearly being built when I took off from Austin and landed in Austin on my trip out to LA and back.
[00:01:53.337 --> 00:01:59.198]  Whatever issue it is that you want to discuss, you are welcome to call in today.
[00:01:59.678 --> 00:02:01.379]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.619]  800-259-9231.
[00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:02.599]  We'll take everybody's calls.
[00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.299]  It's wide open phones.
[00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:06.840]  First-time callers, though, will go to the head of the line.
[00:02:16.742 --> 00:02:19.465]  They are only trumped by callers that disagree.
[00:02:19.545 --> 00:02:22.148]  So if you tell us that you disagree, we don't screen the calls.
[00:02:22.188 --> 00:02:25.551]  We ask what your first name is, what city you're calling from, what state.
[00:02:25.572 --> 00:02:34.501]  It would be nice if you'd tell us if you're listening on an AM or FM station or internet or satellite or shortwave or however you're tuning in.
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:44.224]  But if you do volunteer that you disagree, and you really do disagree, you go to the head of the line, and if you're a first-time caller, you also go to the head of the line, respectively.
[00:02:44.344 --> 00:02:45.024]  So 1-800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[00:02:45.044 --> 00:02:46.605]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:02:46.685 --> 00:02:50.006]  The websites are Infowars.com, Infowars.net, JonesReport.com.
[00:02:50.046 --> 00:02:53.108]  We also have PrisonPlanet.tv and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:04.614 --> 00:03:10.976]  Canadian military-style secret police kidnap, detain, and torture Bilderberg investigators.
[00:03:11.376 --> 00:03:17.839]  Interrogators threaten to cut off arms during six-hour marathon hell, and that is psychological torture.
[00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:23.881]  I mean, that's what a kidnapper puts a gun to a child's head and says, let me out of here, cops, or I'm going to blow the kid's head off.
[00:03:24.421 --> 00:03:25.241]  That is torture.
[00:03:25.322 --> 00:03:25.962]  Who could disagree?
[00:03:26.002 --> 00:03:27.342]  Well, this is torture, too.
[00:03:27.982 --> 00:03:28.823]  It's terrorism.
[00:03:29.423 --> 00:03:32.184]  Terrorism is do what I say or I'm going to cut your arms off.
[00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.781]  So it's terrorism by every yardstick.
[00:03:35.822 --> 00:03:40.427]  ACLU objects as two companies offer mind-reading technology to the government.
[00:03:40.847 --> 00:03:41.748]  No, we're not kidding.
[00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:43.229]  This stuff's already going in airports.
[00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:44.931]  I never got to it yesterday.
[00:03:44.951 --> 00:03:46.653]  I want to tell a story of what happened to my father.
[00:03:47.253 --> 00:03:51.758]  He went to a wedding with my mother and sister in Jamaica over the weekend.
[00:03:51.778 --> 00:03:53.400]  Family friends getting married.
[00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:55.802]  Family friend's daughter getting married.
[00:03:57.362 --> 00:04:00.743]  And on the way back, my dad got to be put in the brand new machine.
[00:04:00.763 --> 00:04:03.645]  I don't know, my dad described what type of machine it is.
[00:04:03.665 --> 00:04:10.127]  I forget the scientific term, but it like shoots all this air out at you like and blows your clothes everywhere.
[00:04:10.147 --> 00:04:13.909]  And then it sucks it into some type of system that heats it up to...
[00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:26.879]  Hundreds and hundreds of degrees and then reads for the resident signature of drugs or weapons, derivatives or traces, bomb traces.
[00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:29.441]  My dad went through it and he saw women.
[00:04:29.481 --> 00:04:31.702]  Every time a woman was put in it, they would scream and yell.
[00:04:31.742 --> 00:04:32.723]  It was so scary.
[00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:34.464]  I said, is that true?
[00:04:34.484 --> 00:04:35.645]  My mother said, yeah.
[00:04:36.065 --> 00:04:38.127]  Women who were put through it, they were selectively put through it.
[00:04:38.167 --> 00:04:41.089]  She wasn't, but women would be put in it and they heard screaming.
[00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.470]  Ahhhh!
[00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.932]  As you're in there, it's all part of the freedom.
[00:04:44.992 --> 00:04:46.594]  Taking your shoes off, all of it.
[00:04:47.014 --> 00:04:50.218]  A ritual of being a slave, training us to do humiliating things.
[00:04:50.838 --> 00:04:51.879]  None of it stops anything.
[00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:55.583]  The government ships in the drugs, and the government carries out the majority of the terror attacks.
[00:04:55.823 --> 00:04:58.526]  So the whole thing's a fraud, and I don't want to hear it's for security.
[00:04:58.746 --> 00:04:59.387]  It's a joke.
[00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.013]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:05:05.752 --> 00:05:07.034]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:05:07.234 --> 00:05:12.981]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:05:13.262 --> 00:05:18.528]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:22.934]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:05:23.154 --> 00:05:38.141]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged, witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips, troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:05:38.181 --> 00:05:40.022]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:05:40.502 --> 00:05:42.583]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyrion today.
[00:05:42.663 --> 00:05:46.944]  Call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:47.024 --> 00:05:47.605]  That's 1-888-253-3139.

[00:05:56.548 --> 00:05:58.048]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:05:58.228 --> 00:06:00.289]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:06:02.097 --> 00:06:11.162]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[00:06:11.402 --> 00:06:22.649]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:06:22.989 --> 00:06:28.712]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:06:28.932 --> 00:06:29.592]  We're good to go.
[00:06:53.337 --> 00:06:53.537]  803-4438.
[00:06:53.557 --> 00:06:59.260]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:07:02.002 --> 00:07:04.583]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:07:04.743 --> 00:07:06.904]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:07:07.184 --> 00:07:17.270]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.931]  Let me tell you something about the Calbin Pure Soap Company.

[00:07:52.378 --> 00:07:53.719]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:54.919]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:09.187 --> 00:08:10.868]  Have a huge free-for-all.
[00:08:10.928 --> 00:08:13.368]  I tend to do this on Thursdays, not Fridays.
[00:08:13.908 --> 00:08:19.930]  Whatever news issue, whatever item, whatever story you want to talk about, we're going to have open phones here in just a few minutes.
[00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:23.411]  We've got to get back into the incredible developments yesterday.
[00:08:23.431 --> 00:08:34.954]  You know, we had one of the gentlemen on last week who was threatened and detained for protesting there at the Bilderberg Group meeting a few weeks ago in, what, June 8th, 9th, and 10th.
[00:08:37.686 --> 00:08:47.108]  And then we talked to some of the other people who were also detained with him, and they brought out even more of the story and have posted a statement, and we've got it on Infowars.com.
[00:08:47.168 --> 00:08:53.569]  Headline, Canadian military secret police kidnap, detain, torture Bilderberg investigators.
[00:08:53.729 --> 00:09:02.371]  Psychologically torture, threatening to cut one man's arms off and saying he could disappear, saying that they knew people that knew him, they had his friends.
[00:09:03.258 --> 00:09:04.320]  Just an incredible story.
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.842]  If you missed it, we'll be getting back into it.
[00:09:05.882 --> 00:09:10.128]  It's up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com right now.
[00:09:10.588 --> 00:09:14.834]  The ACLU is objecting as two companies offer mind-reading technology to the government.
[00:09:15.295 --> 00:09:17.298]  And yes, it's even been put in five airports.
[00:09:17.338 --> 00:09:18.199]  This is not a joke.
[00:09:19.483 --> 00:09:21.704]  Insurgents offer to halt attacks in Iraq.
[00:09:21.724 --> 00:09:23.785]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[00:09:23.825 --> 00:09:24.665]  They say the U.S.
[00:09:24.705 --> 00:09:28.626]  will agree to pull out within two years that they will cease all their activities.
[00:09:29.267 --> 00:09:36.509]  Now, again, that's a deal where if they make the deal, then if the attacks really stop, then there's, quote, no reason for the troops to be there.
[00:09:36.529 --> 00:09:37.650]  But don't look for that happening.
[00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:46.373]  The Pentagon official battle plans say decades upon decades, permanent bases, and civil war was the strategy from the beginning.
[00:09:48.109 --> 00:09:49.830]  So we'll be getting into that report.
[00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:51.910]  China unveils secret space program.
[00:09:51.931 --> 00:09:53.951]  Very interesting out of the Associated Press as well.
[00:09:54.331 --> 00:09:56.752]  British Petroleum accused of price manipulation.
[00:09:56.992 --> 00:09:58.713]  Criminal probe.
[00:09:59.113 --> 00:10:00.394]  Oh, I'm sure it's not true.
[00:10:00.434 --> 00:10:01.054]  They're good.
[00:10:02.415 --> 00:10:04.695]  Interesting article here out of Computer World.
[00:10:05.056 --> 00:10:07.316]  Would the bird flu kill the Internet too?
[00:10:07.376 --> 00:10:10.037]  That's what a war game is showing it would do.
[00:10:10.097 --> 00:10:11.778]  Any excuse for them to shut down the web.
[00:10:11.818 --> 00:10:13.819]  So now they're basically telling us that'll happen.
[00:10:14.665 --> 00:10:16.486]  Hello Mr. Jones, this is Javier Fuentes from Austin, Texas.
[00:10:44.688 --> 00:10:45.468]  Welcome.
[00:10:45.748 --> 00:10:48.809]  I've been listening to some of the workers where we work at.
[00:10:49.089 --> 00:10:50.609]  We do construction out here.
[00:10:51.429 --> 00:11:02.071]  And they were talking about, and they brought me a newspaper saying that they were trying to get illegals, I guess, into concentration camps over in New Mexico.
[00:11:02.091 --> 00:11:04.152]  That it was in one of the newspapers.
[00:11:04.352 --> 00:11:04.632]  Yes.
[00:11:06.972 --> 00:11:09.353]  And use them to work over here.
[00:11:09.593 --> 00:11:10.613]  Yes, labor camps.
[00:11:11.233 --> 00:11:11.473]  Right.
[00:11:12.251 --> 00:11:12.991]  Okie dokie.
[00:11:13.031 --> 00:11:14.992]  So that is true, then, I guess.
[00:11:15.032 --> 00:11:16.992]  Well, you said they brought you a newspaper article.
[00:11:17.052 --> 00:11:21.793]  Yeah, it was a Mexican newspaper that was printed here in Austin, Texas.
[00:11:22.573 --> 00:11:28.334]  Yeah, I was on a syndicated radio show, what is it, Victor Camacho Show, in L.A.
[00:11:28.354 --> 00:11:32.275]  I've even heard that on Spanish radio here in Austin.
[00:11:32.315 --> 00:11:36.975]  I looked at the channels and heard Victor Camacho, and he comes on and I listen to him in Spanish.
[00:11:37.035 --> 00:11:39.236]  I was on his show for two hours.
[00:11:40.876 --> 00:11:51.081]  And they had Reuters, they had the article, a bunch of Mexican newspapers, they also had the original article that came out, I guess, five, six months ago in the Houston Chronicle.
[00:11:51.681 --> 00:11:57.724]  And going back, in the Rex 84 plan that leaked out in congressional hearings in 19...
[00:11:59.102 --> 00:12:00.043]  We're good to go.
[00:12:00.063 --> 00:12:00.663]  We're good to go.
[00:12:23.857 --> 00:12:33.160]  What the Rex 84 plan said was they would build all these camps in the name of putting illegal aliens in them, but really it would be used for American citizens during national crises.
[00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.081]  And so the Rex 84 plan has been brought out of mothballs.
[00:12:36.101 --> 00:12:43.744]  It really never was, but now it's been publicly announced that, oh, it's just for the illegals, knowing that 90% of Americans are against the open borders and the flood of illegals.
[00:12:43.764 --> 00:12:44.964]  I don't think they should be put in camps.
[00:12:45.325 --> 00:12:46.145]  They should be reported.
[00:12:46.985 --> 00:12:49.026]  And so they're kind of selling it and breaking the ice.
[00:12:49.086 --> 00:12:53.647]  It's like, oh, we've got to have gun confiscation with foreign troops, but just in New Orleans.
[00:12:53.847 --> 00:12:57.108]  Oh, we've got to have emergency camps, but just for the illegal.
[00:12:57.148 --> 00:13:02.530]  See, they're breaking the ice with things they think will be palatable with the general public.
[00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:04.531]  Is this scaring people at the work sites?
[00:13:05.011 --> 00:13:06.011]  Yes, sir, it is.
[00:13:06.131 --> 00:13:11.513]  And they've been talking about this, and a lot of the people that I know of that we work with,
[00:13:12.076 --> 00:13:13.198]  They've been talking their life.
[00:13:13.418 --> 00:13:14.579]  We're not going in there.
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:20.367]  I mean, we left Mexico for that, you know, being oppressed and stuff, and now they want to do it here, too.
[00:13:21.148 --> 00:13:28.318]  So it's kind of... I don't think... I mean, I think it's wrong, but I think once that problem is...
[00:13:28.766 --> 00:13:32.769]  It's done with, let's say, with the illegals, and we don't have a problem with the illegals.
[00:13:33.089 --> 00:13:33.429]  That's right.
[00:13:33.449 --> 00:13:36.852]  They're going to build an infrastructure in the name of stopping illegals.
[00:13:37.252 --> 00:13:38.413]  It has nothing to do with it.
[00:13:38.453 --> 00:13:42.115]  It's like they go, we're going to make the foreigners coming in thumb scan and face scan.
[00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:42.716]  Well, wait a minute.
[00:13:43.036 --> 00:13:47.099]  Under the National ID Card Real ID Act, it's going to happen to all American citizens, see?
[00:13:47.619 --> 00:13:49.801]  Whatever they do to the illegals, they're going to do to citizens.
[00:13:50.341 --> 00:13:55.665]  That's what we're talking about because, I mean, we have a lot of white people, all kinds of people that work on our job sites.
[00:13:56.368 --> 00:14:08.251]  And we sit down at lunchtime, listen to your show, and talk about it, and one of the things that we're talking is, like, one guy told me, he said, well, once all you guys are gone, what's going to happen to those camps?
[00:14:08.411 --> 00:14:13.152]  And then we're like, well, it's going to get used on the next group of guys, which is probably you guys.
[00:14:13.232 --> 00:14:13.932]  Well, don't worry.
[00:14:14.012 --> 00:14:21.893]  I mean, for the news cameras, they're going to use the detention centers at first for a few thousand illegals here and there, but it was never meant for illegal aliens to begin with.
[00:14:22.614 --> 00:14:22.854]  Right.
[00:14:23.194 --> 00:14:24.794]  But anything else, Javier?
[00:14:25.487 --> 00:14:26.448]  No, sir, just that.
[00:14:26.748 --> 00:14:33.371]  And I think, you know, there's a lot of Mexican people out here that I think we would probably stand right beside everybody.
[00:14:33.391 --> 00:14:34.072]  I know that.
[00:14:35.436 --> 00:14:36.996]  Really stand right beside everybody.
[00:14:37.337 --> 00:14:37.737]  I know that.
[00:14:37.777 --> 00:14:41.018]  Well, that's encouraging, and I appreciate your call.
[00:14:41.058 --> 00:14:48.440]  Now, I've found that Mexicans who don't consider themselves Americans, I've talked to a lot of them, know about the New World Order, know about 9-11.
[00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.680]  Just still some of them are into this La Reconquista stuff.
[00:14:51.741 --> 00:14:57.022]  But if you talk to them, I've found that they're pretty sophisticated because they've lived under corruption, and they get it.
[00:14:58.515 --> 00:15:13.073]  So, again, we are reaching out to Hispanic Americans who are very patriotic and aware of what's happening, and we're also reaching out to the illegal aliens and explaining to them that they're just being used as tools to drive down wages and break down the sovereignty of this country.
[00:15:13.694 --> 00:15:16.017]  And, again, Victor Camacho, when I was on...
[00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:22.113]  You know, big radio station, biggest Spanish station in L.A., and then it was syndicated around the country.
[00:15:22.733 --> 00:15:32.198]  The callers were all calling in agreeing and understanding, and we were talking about La Reconquista and how it's a Ford Foundation setup, and they were aware of what was happening, so that was very heartening.
[00:15:32.879 --> 00:15:34.380]  But this is why I love just taking calls.
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:37.181]  See, every caller, it's like a grab bag of issues.
[00:15:37.221 --> 00:15:39.623]  It brings up really serious issues.
[00:15:40.083 --> 00:15:43.105]  So we just reach into the barrel, and we'll find out what's next.
[00:15:43.205 --> 00:15:45.446]  Jeff, where are you calling us from today?
[00:15:47.205 --> 00:15:47.846]  Hello, Alex?
[00:15:47.886 --> 00:15:49.067]  Hi, where are you calling us from?
[00:15:49.367 --> 00:15:50.167]  From New Orleans.
[00:15:50.227 --> 00:15:58.354]  I just got a new shortwave radio, and I'm able to pick you up just fine on that WWCR frequency, but we have another problem on our hands.
[00:15:58.894 --> 00:16:03.398]  Line item veto has passed the House last week by 247 to 151.
[00:16:06.886 --> 00:16:15.733]  And line item veto gives the president too much power.
[00:16:15.833 --> 00:16:17.915]  It's a violation of the separation of powers.
[00:16:18.556 --> 00:16:23.660]  But at the same time, he's already exercising not a line item veto, but a dictatorial veto.
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:29.885]  He signs bills and then rewrites them with statements and then considers that to be law.
[00:16:30.185 --> 00:16:32.647]  Then he ignores other previous laws he doesn't agree with.
[00:16:33.047 --> 00:16:34.028]  That's exactly right.
[00:16:34.068 --> 00:16:39.231]  But at any rate, this was reported by Tammy Bruce, of all people, who was in favor of this thing.
[00:16:39.251 --> 00:16:41.492]  And of course, the line item veto...
[00:16:42.088 --> 00:16:49.311]  She's saying it's supposed to control spending, but she forgets that Article 1, Section 1 says that Congress is supposed to initiate the bills.
[00:16:49.371 --> 00:16:49.812]  That's right.
[00:16:49.932 --> 00:16:58.556]  Congress initiates the bills and raises the funds, and then the President executes the will of the Congress that is elected by the people.
[00:16:58.996 --> 00:16:59.496]  That's right.
[00:16:59.576 --> 00:17:07.920]  So the point is that if this thing goes through under this SOS bill and is reconciled with the House version of the line item veto...
[00:17:08.433 --> 00:17:12.662]  We are under a Roman imperial dictatorship right off the bat, I can tell you.
[00:17:12.842 --> 00:17:14.245]  There's no joking.
[00:17:15.027 --> 00:17:15.628]  It's serious.
[00:17:15.668 --> 00:17:16.670]  You're absolutely right.
[00:17:17.211 --> 00:17:19.636]  And of course, that's what a lot of the networks are...
[00:17:20.743 --> 00:17:23.345]  Well, let's not forget that, oh, let's give Bush this power, he won't spend money.
[00:17:23.385 --> 00:17:26.927]  He can still veto bills entirely, and that takes a two-thirds majority to override.
[00:17:39.236 --> 00:17:41.277]  And I think that's constitutional.
[00:17:41.297 --> 00:17:43.818]  I mean, anything that has a separation of powers is good.
[00:17:44.618 --> 00:17:50.240]  But that brings more diversity to the debate and a bigger stopgap against tyranny.
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:57.002]  But any argument that Bush is doing something to stop spending, he spent more money than all presidents before him combined.
[00:17:57.022 --> 00:17:58.482]  Thanks for the call, Jeff.
[00:17:58.602 --> 00:17:58.942]  Thank you.
[00:17:58.962 --> 00:17:59.623]  We'll keep in touch.
[00:17:59.763 --> 00:18:00.403]  Thank you, sir.
[00:18:00.463 --> 00:18:02.123]  Thanks for telling us about that legislation.
[00:18:02.664 --> 00:18:03.924]  Bruce in Colorado.
[00:18:03.964 --> 00:18:05.024]  Bruce, you're on the air.
[00:18:05.044 --> 00:18:06.345]  Oh, hi there, Alex.
[00:18:06.665 --> 00:18:06.805]  Hi.
[00:18:07.612 --> 00:18:17.881]  I saw a terrorist storm, and one of the comments I want to make about it is that to me it looks like a great deprogramming tool.
[00:18:17.941 --> 00:18:36.536]  You could sit somebody down who doesn't believe any of this, and you could ask them to watch three minutes, and they would be so captivated by the graphics, the sound, the way you did that, that they would be caught up and want to sit down for the whole thing, even if they didn't believe it.
[00:18:37.304 --> 00:18:38.345]  That's what I like about it.
[00:18:38.365 --> 00:18:45.828]  It's got the Hollywood style, you know, to kind of suck somebody into it, and I think it's great the way it does it.
[00:18:46.869 --> 00:18:51.752]  Speaking about double speak, people are bound to see this working in their own minds.
[00:18:51.792 --> 00:18:54.573]  That's why I believe it's one of the best movies you've made.
[00:18:54.593 --> 00:18:56.134]  That's right.
[00:18:56.194 --> 00:18:59.295]  We don't just cover government terrorism or the war.
[00:18:59.496 --> 00:19:03.137]  We also cover Orwellian double think and double speak.
[00:19:03.938 --> 00:19:04.138]  Right.
[00:19:05.081 --> 00:19:09.464]  I've got on a web page, I've got something about how to make VCR copies.
[00:19:09.584 --> 00:19:12.165]  I've run into people that cannot make copies.
[00:19:12.225 --> 00:19:16.448]  You can explain it to them, show them, and they don't know unless they have instructions.
[00:19:17.028 --> 00:19:18.329]  So I put it on my website.
[00:19:18.349 --> 00:19:24.693]  I also put a couple of pages, single pages that people can print out that I have found to be extremely effective.
[00:19:25.753 --> 00:19:33.318]  Just the one page, grabbing people's attention and getting them to look further on the web and through other... Sure, I mean, if you just go to a...
[00:19:35.359 --> 00:19:36.680]  Big electronic supply store.
[00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:42.662]  It's like 50 bucks for a dual VCR where you put one in, hit play, put the other in, hit record.
[00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:43.623]  I don't understand.
[00:19:44.283 --> 00:19:46.984]  Okay, let me get your website so that people can find you.
[00:19:47.004 --> 00:19:47.525]  Okay, quickly.
[00:19:47.625 --> 00:19:48.645]  Fire Council.
[00:19:48.745 --> 00:19:53.167]  P as in Paul, S as in Sam, I as in India, C-O-U-N-S-E-L dot com.
[00:19:53.527 --> 00:19:54.528]  All right, thank you, sir.
[00:19:54.848 --> 00:19:55.708]  Keep up the good work.
[00:19:56.088 --> 00:19:57.429]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[00:19:57.449 --> 00:19:57.509]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:20:02.339 --> 00:20:05.620]  Do you remember when you could eat most anything and not worry about it?
[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.281]  Or maybe weight management has always been a problem.
[00:20:08.801 --> 00:20:14.163]  Are you frustrated, burned out, and tired of fad diets and marketing gimmicks that don't really work?
[00:20:14.703 --> 00:20:20.565]  Do you want a proven system, a long-term solution to live a healthier lifestyle and properly manage your weight?
[00:20:21.349 --> 00:20:24.411]  At WeCanTogether.com, our approach is different.

[00:21:07.067 --> 00:21:10.348]  Currency devaluation, inflation, one and the same.
[00:21:11.068 --> 00:21:15.070]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:21:21.331 --> 00:21:24.452]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:21:24.712 --> 00:21:26.552]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:21:26.612 --> 00:21:29.633]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:21:30.173 --> 00:21:32.394]  Here is reality.
[00:21:32.894 --> 00:21:36.355]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:21:36.835 --> 00:21:40.496]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:21:41.056 --> 00:21:43.877]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[00:21:45.245 --> 00:21:45.685]  We're good to go.
[00:22:01.164 --> 00:22:06.446]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.

[00:24:17.856 --> 00:24:18.937]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:24:19.817 --> 00:24:23.018]  Let's go to a first-time caller, Dave in Vancouver, Canada.
[00:24:23.058 --> 00:24:24.019]  Dave, you're on the air.
[00:24:24.059 --> 00:24:24.439]  Welcome.
[00:24:24.459 --> 00:24:25.819]  Hi, Alex.
[00:24:25.859 --> 00:24:26.840]  Thanks a lot for having me.
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.800]  You bet.
[00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:38.004]  I had to call in because I've been a long-time listener, and my friends, and maybe CPAP, you're so persuasive, but...
[00:24:38.703 --> 00:24:42.745]  I mean, your message is just... It's out there if you're just first coming into it, you know?
[00:24:42.765 --> 00:24:44.165]  Well, I don't think I'm persuasive.
[00:24:44.185 --> 00:24:50.528]  The information is documented, and so what we talk about is unbelievable and sensational, but it's real.
[00:24:51.148 --> 00:24:51.628]  Yes, it is.
[00:24:51.688 --> 00:24:52.509]  Absolutely.
[00:24:52.709 --> 00:24:54.129]  I 100% agree with you there.
[00:24:54.169 --> 00:24:55.630]  You've backed up everything you say.
[00:24:56.290 --> 00:25:08.055]  Listen, we just had the Vancouver World Peace Forum, and I was there trying to spread 9-11 truth, and it's hard because it's funny, you know, we were kind of played down at the forum itself, but...
[00:25:09.382 --> 00:25:22.033]  The forum didn't get very much media playtime compared to the World Urban Forum, which was kind of a weird thing that was going on at the same time scientists from all over the world were trying to make cities more efficient.
[00:25:22.334 --> 00:25:23.394]  It was really weird to see.
[00:25:23.414 --> 00:25:25.897]  Yeah, a big smart growth, smart city convention.
[00:25:26.397 --> 00:25:26.857]  Exactly.
[00:25:27.158 --> 00:25:31.782]  Now, that overplayed the Peace Forum quite a bit, which is very important to us up here.
[00:25:31.902 --> 00:25:36.366]  I don't think we're an imperial nation, but we have boys in Afghanistan and
[00:25:37.482 --> 00:25:45.431]  Well, anyway, the point I wanted to make to you, sir, is America is, their greatest export is heroes, sir.
[00:25:46.072 --> 00:25:49.996]  And William Rodriguez is my personal hero.
[00:25:50.096 --> 00:25:51.157]  He is a hero, yes.
[00:25:51.618 --> 00:25:52.699]  God bless you both, sir.
[00:25:53.219 --> 00:25:56.683]  Did you hear the story about him threatening to cut a Canadian's arms off?
[00:25:57.583 --> 00:25:58.983]  No, sir, I haven't.
[00:25:59.403 --> 00:26:01.424]  It's up on prisonplanet.com.
[00:26:01.444 --> 00:26:04.005]  Yeah, the secret police grabbed him, according to these witnesses.
[00:26:04.045 --> 00:26:08.966]  I saw the headline, and, you know, it terrifies me, to be honest with you, sir.
[00:26:09.826 --> 00:26:12.987]  Because... What they're doing is to keep you safe.
[00:26:13.007 --> 00:26:14.767]  They're doing it to keep you safe, though.
[00:26:14.787 --> 00:26:21.349]  Yeah, and the thing is, what I've come to realize is that the worst thing you can do is be afraid of them.
[00:26:21.829 --> 00:26:25.230]  The worst thing you can do is shut up, because they tell you to shut up.
[00:26:26.626 --> 00:26:30.308]  The only thing you can really do is be honest with your opinion and forthright.
[00:26:30.328 --> 00:26:34.792]  I was talking to Jim Fetzer last night, the scholar from 9-11 Truth.
[00:26:34.812 --> 00:26:36.873]  You've interviewed him, I think, right?
[00:26:37.594 --> 00:26:38.454]  Yes, sir, I have.
[00:26:39.095 --> 00:26:39.295]  Right.
[00:26:39.775 --> 00:26:43.238]  And you were saying, you know, he just got off of the Colms report last night.
[00:26:43.258 --> 00:26:48.202]  A lot of people were making fun of him because he was abrupt.
[00:26:48.462 --> 00:26:50.924]  Was he there in Canada?
[00:26:51.764 --> 00:26:52.625]  No, no, no.
[00:26:53.345 --> 00:26:55.247]  I think he was interviewing from his home on the phone.
[00:26:55.922 --> 00:26:58.243]  But he did a fantastic job, I thought.
[00:26:58.263 --> 00:26:59.103]  Yeah, he did.
[00:26:59.403 --> 00:27:01.744]  Listen, good to have you on board up there in Canada, Dave.
[00:27:01.764 --> 00:27:02.204]  Take care.
[00:27:02.584 --> 00:27:04.745]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ray in Texas.
[00:27:04.845 --> 00:27:05.685]  Ray, you're on the air.
[00:27:08.706 --> 00:27:10.426]  Okay, Ray, are you going to come to the phone?
[00:27:10.446 --> 00:27:11.646]  I'm not going to do it?
[00:27:11.686 --> 00:27:11.987]  All right.
[00:27:12.407 --> 00:27:13.007]  J.R.
[00:27:13.087 --> 00:27:14.547]  in South Dakota, you're on the air.
[00:27:14.587 --> 00:27:15.428]  Go ahead, J.R.
[00:27:15.448 --> 00:27:17.748]  Hi.
[00:27:17.768 --> 00:27:19.689]  Alex, long-time listener, first-time caller.
[00:27:20.009 --> 00:27:20.369]  Welcome.
[00:27:20.916 --> 00:27:21.176]  Thank you.
[00:27:22.117 --> 00:27:23.377]  I just want to say I was at the L.A.
[00:27:23.417 --> 00:27:25.278]  conference, and that was truly amazing.
[00:27:25.298 --> 00:27:26.099]  It was awesome.
[00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:31.822]  Probably the best part, I think, was William Rodriguez when he was talking about what happened.
[00:27:32.522 --> 00:27:34.083]  He did an incredible job, didn't he?
[00:27:34.683 --> 00:27:34.944]  Oh, yeah.
[00:27:35.204 --> 00:27:39.226]  I kind of had tears in my eyes at some point in his speech.
[00:27:39.406 --> 00:27:48.931]  But anyways, what I wanted to talk about today was the EFTA highways and also that actually being in motion pictures.
[00:27:49.171 --> 00:27:50.372]  I mean, we always talk about, you know,
[00:27:51.576 --> 00:27:55.259]  V for Vendetta and Star Wars and other movies.
[00:27:55.299 --> 00:27:56.760]  I mean, we can go on all day about that.
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.343]  But basically, have you ever seen the movie Traffic?
[00:28:00.183 --> 00:28:00.824]  Yes, I have.
[00:28:01.224 --> 00:28:02.806]  Yeah, they talk about the NAFTA highways and that.
[00:28:03.306 --> 00:28:05.768]  It's an excellent film, and I do remember that, yes.
[00:28:06.629 --> 00:28:10.012]  Yes, I mean, they actually say, oh, you know, you kind of have some successes.
[00:28:10.132 --> 00:28:13.215]  You don't really get anything on the borders right now.
[00:28:13.596 --> 00:28:14.757]  But as soon as the highway comes in...
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:16.641]  There's no way you can stop us.
[00:28:16.961 --> 00:28:17.842]  Everything's going to go through.
[00:28:17.862 --> 00:28:19.083]  Might as well just quit now.
[00:28:19.363 --> 00:28:19.843]  That's right.
[00:28:19.903 --> 00:28:26.209]  Michael Douglas is in that, and they admit the Napa Superhighway right there in that movie from, what, traffic's about four or five years old now?
[00:28:27.069 --> 00:28:31.213]  Yeah, I think it was, like, what, 2001 or 2002 when it came out, I believe.
[00:28:33.555 --> 00:28:35.256]  Yeah, that's an anti-drug war film.
[00:28:35.296 --> 00:28:36.097]  It's very accurate.
[00:28:38.719 --> 00:28:41.621]  Yes, I guess that was just about it, I guess.
[00:28:42.081 --> 00:28:42.542]  I'll get off.
[00:28:43.146 --> 00:28:46.367]  Well, I mean, just some final parting ideas on the conference.
[00:28:46.387 --> 00:28:47.747]  What else did you like about the conference?
[00:28:48.667 --> 00:28:54.268]  Well, I thought it was just kind of cool that you could just talk to everybody in the little conference room outside.
[00:28:54.288 --> 00:28:57.209]  All the big names, all the panels were there.
[00:28:57.229 --> 00:29:00.570]  You can kind of chit-chat with them, get their ideas on other things.
[00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:00.910]  That's right.
[00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:01.930]  We had a big media room.
[00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:02.650]  We had a viewing room.
[00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:04.831]  And then we had the big room that would hold 1,200 people.
[00:29:04.891 --> 00:29:06.971]  So it was a great event.
[00:29:07.031 --> 00:29:07.491]  I loved it.
[00:29:08.231 --> 00:29:09.371]  Massive information there.
[00:29:09.492 --> 00:29:10.792]  Books, movies you can buy.
[00:29:10.872 --> 00:29:11.652]  I mean, T-shirts.
[00:29:12.849 --> 00:29:13.170]  Everybody.
[00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:17.434]  It was just a wealth of information, if you will.
[00:29:17.474 --> 00:29:25.203]  My only frustration is that I'd have to get from one place to another, walking the floor, running things, and then so many great people wanted to stop and talk, and I'd try to.
[00:29:25.928 --> 00:29:26.768]  We're on the march.
[00:29:26.788 --> 00:29:27.428]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.666 --> 00:29:58.451]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.555 --> 00:30:02.098]  Hi, Mary.
[00:30:02.258 --> 00:30:03.240]  Good morning, Tom.
[00:30:03.521 --> 00:30:04.543]  Oh, you don't look well.
[00:30:04.803 --> 00:30:06.346]  I took your advice with a spoonful of sugar.
[00:30:06.366 --> 00:30:07.889]  It didn't give me the energy you said it would.
[00:30:08.148 --> 00:30:09.729]  Spoonful of sugar, right?
[00:30:09.949 --> 00:30:11.330]  That's an embarrassing pastime.
[00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:12.770]  I'm a changed woman, Tom.
[00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:16.092]  I found the products at OPCpure.com to be exceptional.
[00:30:16.312 --> 00:30:21.234]  They're all-natural, energy-giving supplements, restore your body's health, and keeps you going without groggy side effects.
[00:30:21.574 --> 00:30:23.335]  Spoonful of OPCpure.com, huh?
[00:30:23.515 --> 00:30:24.716]  Oh, I love the sound of that.
[00:30:24.956 --> 00:30:28.158]  Just a spoonful of OPCpure.com helps the energy go up.
[00:30:28.518 --> 00:30:30.499]  Pure, unadulterated, raw energy.
[00:30:30.659 --> 00:30:31.139]  Go for it.
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:34.821]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:30:35.281 --> 00:30:37.082]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:30:37.884 --> 00:30:41.065]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:30:41.705 --> 00:30:48.188]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[00:30:48.968 --> 00:30:51.169]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[00:30:51.549 --> 00:30:51.869]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:30:51.909 --> 00:30:52.369]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:31:01.658 --> 00:31:03.259]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:31:03.399 --> 00:31:07.542]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:31:07.642 --> 00:31:10.524]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:31:10.604 --> 00:31:17.289]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:31:17.489 --> 00:31:20.493]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:31:20.713 --> 00:31:23.096]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:31:23.237 --> 00:31:33.390]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aprazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:34.330]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:36.071]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:32:03.584 --> 00:32:04.245]  Hey, Bill.
[00:32:04.605 --> 00:32:05.686]  I'm buying lunch today.
[00:32:06.026 --> 00:32:06.827]  And check this out.
[00:32:07.168 --> 00:32:08.068]  I bought a new car.
[00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.789]  Wow, John.
[00:32:08.849 --> 00:32:13.374]  I guess you took my advice and visited that website we were talking about over lunch last time we met.
[00:32:13.934 --> 00:32:18.078]  www.didyourobbillgates.com I did, and you were right.
[00:32:18.418 --> 00:32:23.323]  I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[00:32:23.724 --> 00:32:26.146]  And it's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[00:32:26.466 --> 00:32:29.808]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my fifth week.
[00:32:30.069 --> 00:32:30.969]  Whoa, that's awesome!
[00:32:31.309 --> 00:32:33.711]  John, your business will keep growing as mine has.
[00:32:34.071 --> 00:32:36.313]  In fact, people are joining from all over the world.
[00:32:36.433 --> 00:32:37.093]  It's incredible!
[00:32:37.473 --> 00:32:44.938]  Everyone should go to www.DidYouRobBillGates.com and learn how this program can help them become financially independent, too.
[00:32:45.259 --> 00:32:49.822]  Thanks a million, Bill, for telling me about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:32:50.791 --> 00:32:51.492]  Check, please.
[00:32:51.952 --> 00:32:52.833]  I got this one, Bill.
[00:32:53.294 --> 00:32:53.914]  Sure, John.
[00:32:54.054 --> 00:32:58.659]  Let's tell everyone about www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[00:32:58.819 --> 00:32:59.140]  Deal.
[00:33:02.283 --> 00:33:07.408]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:08.109 --> 00:33:10.411]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:17.299 --> 00:33:21.751]  I think in the final segment of this hour, we'll replay Governor Rick Perry on the show yesterday.
[00:33:21.771 --> 00:33:23.215]  It was only for a few minutes.
[00:33:24.022 --> 00:33:25.263]  Jim Dillon is running for governor.
[00:33:25.283 --> 00:33:29.885]  He was down at the Capitol trying to get some of the signs back that were confiscated when he was down there protesting.
[00:33:30.325 --> 00:33:34.566]  He's out by the side door at the back of the Capitol, and out comes Rick Perry.
[00:33:35.227 --> 00:33:35.907]  I talked to Jim.
[00:33:35.927 --> 00:33:37.088]  Jim doesn't make stuff up.
[00:33:37.548 --> 00:33:38.508]  It really was Rick Perry.
[00:33:38.548 --> 00:33:39.469]  I recognize his voice.
[00:33:39.869 --> 00:33:40.689]  At first, I didn't believe it.
[00:33:40.709 --> 00:33:42.290]  I thought it was a joke.
[00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:44.851]  I wish I would have hit him with harder questions.
[00:33:44.891 --> 00:33:47.092]  As soon as I did, he got off the phone.
[00:33:47.152 --> 00:33:48.352]  I keep going, is this really Rick Perry?
[00:33:48.372 --> 00:33:49.193]  Is this really Rick Perry?
[00:33:49.733 --> 00:33:50.813]  And yes, it was Rick Perry.
[00:33:51.073 --> 00:33:52.534]  We do have Kiki Friedman coming on.
[00:33:53.537 --> 00:33:55.881]  Kiki Friedman in a couple weeks is going to be on Running for Governor.
[00:33:56.502 --> 00:33:57.964]  And he is for shutting down the borders.
[00:33:58.024 --> 00:33:59.146]  It'll just be an interesting discussion.
[00:33:59.186 --> 00:34:01.750]  He's a well-known writer and comedian, of course.
[00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:02.672]  I'm sure many of you know.
[00:34:02.692 --> 00:34:06.618]  But I'm going to try to get old Rick Perry over the telephone for ten minutes on.
[00:34:06.958 --> 00:34:08.100]  We'll see if he'll do it.
[00:34:09.328 --> 00:34:11.729]  I've got quite a few comments for the governor.
[00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:13.150]  I really doubt it.
[00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:20.974]  I think we just caught him at a good time and he was in a good mood and wanted to insult me a little bit and say I was sweating like a big hog, which was true.
[00:34:20.994 --> 00:34:24.956]  That was on the cover of the paper, so I guess he saw that and I bullhorned him.
[00:34:25.316 --> 00:34:26.516]  So we'll try to play that later.
[00:34:26.536 --> 00:34:30.858]  I'm going to go to Eric, Matt, James, Rob, Sasha, and others.
[00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:35.100]  Remember, first-time callers or callers that disagree, go to the front of the line, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:40.325 --> 00:34:41.466]  And we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:34:41.766 --> 00:34:44.127]  Just briefly, my new film Terror Storm is out.
[00:34:44.167 --> 00:34:46.829]  It gets into the Orwellian mind control the public is under.
[00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:49.310]  It gets into propaganda.
[00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:53.793]  Going back to Edward Bernays, we cover the Iraq War and the lies that led us into that.
[00:34:54.413 --> 00:34:55.334]  We look at Iran.
[00:34:56.014 --> 00:34:58.375]  It's got Ray McGovern in it, CIA analyst.
[00:34:58.455 --> 00:35:00.476]  It's got Michael Meacher, Member of Parliament.
[00:35:00.957 --> 00:35:03.778]  It's got David Shaler and Annie Michon, MI5 agents.
[00:35:04.259 --> 00:35:05.699]  It's got Cindy Sheehan in it.
[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:09.782]  It's got Professor Stephen Jones, Morgan Reynolds.
[00:35:10.422 --> 00:35:11.084]  We're good to go.
[00:35:21.443 --> 00:35:21.943]  We're good to go.
[00:35:45.339 --> 00:35:55.606]  I do authorize you for non-profit educational purposes, for not-for-sale purposes, for educational reasons to get this out to people.
[00:35:55.646 --> 00:35:56.827]  In fact, I ask you to.
[00:35:58.088 --> 00:36:05.133]  Because through you, the listeners, doing this, we have such an amazing chance and ability to wake people up.
[00:36:05.193 --> 00:36:06.053]  So please do it.
[00:36:06.514 --> 00:36:10.536]  And yes, I made, I don't know, less than 500 copies of this.
[00:36:11.437 --> 00:36:12.077]  We made a little over 1,000.
[00:36:13.394 --> 00:36:17.195]  Under 500 copies were left after the 9-11 conference we had in L.A.
[00:36:17.835 --> 00:36:19.936]  And so it is a version of the film.
[00:36:20.016 --> 00:36:21.956]  It's actually got about four and a half minutes cut out of it.
[00:36:22.396 --> 00:36:30.438]  That is the version you'll be getting right now will be longer than the final version that's a little bit fancier and a little bit more tweaked that will also have 30 minutes of extras on it.
[00:36:31.859 --> 00:36:32.639]  But we can't wait.
[00:36:32.779 --> 00:36:36.560]  So get this collector's item, American Scholar Symposium version of it.
[00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:39.761]  It has that on the opening menu before you play the film.
[00:36:40.741 --> 00:36:41.061]  It is...
[00:36:42.563 --> 00:36:44.023]  Man, there's only 400-something copies.
[00:36:44.063 --> 00:36:45.804]  In fact, there's a lot less than that now.
[00:36:45.844 --> 00:36:47.444]  I've been plugging it for a day and a half.
[00:36:48.025 --> 00:36:52.526]  So get your copy now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:36:52.586 --> 00:36:53.926]  You have a safe, secure online shopping cart.
[00:36:54.006 --> 00:36:59.368]  Order your hard copy, high-quality DVD, or you can simply call toll-free.
[00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:06.936]  You can simply call toll-free to get your copy of Terror Storm or any of the other videos or books that we carry or have produced or written.
[00:37:07.297 --> 00:37:07.877]  And that's 1-888-253-3139.
[00:37:07.917 --> 00:37:08.258]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:37:08.318 --> 00:37:09.959]  Or just write to me.
[00:37:10.039 --> 00:37:12.321]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[00:37:26.034 --> 00:37:27.155]  Again, Terror Storm.
[00:37:27.476 --> 00:37:31.479]  In about a month, it'll be available on the official DVD with the extras and all the rest of it.
[00:37:31.499 --> 00:37:33.081]  But get those collectors out of now.
[00:37:33.381 --> 00:37:33.981]  We can't wait.
[00:37:34.061 --> 00:37:34.342]  Get it.
[00:37:34.382 --> 00:37:35.283]  Start burning copies.
[00:37:35.323 --> 00:37:35.983]  Give it to everybody.
[00:37:36.023 --> 00:37:38.886]  It's under two hours, so it burns on a standard DVD.
[00:37:39.366 --> 00:37:40.948]  You can really have a big effect with this.
[00:37:41.348 --> 00:37:46.393]  So again, InfoWars.com or see it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:37:46.533 --> 00:37:47.454]  Great activist tool.
[00:37:47.494 --> 00:37:47.994]  Get on there.
[00:37:48.354 --> 00:37:49.295]  Start burning copies.
[00:37:49.335 --> 00:37:50.697]  Start giving it to people.
[00:37:50.737 --> 00:37:52.138]  Start having an effect.
[00:37:52.498 --> 00:37:59.304]  I made this film so it would be seen and so it would expose the terrorists, the criminals that carried out 9-11, so the ball is in your court.
[00:37:59.804 --> 00:38:01.766]  Right now, let's go back to the calls.
[00:38:01.826 --> 00:38:03.427]  Let's talk to Eric in Connecticut.
[00:38:03.487 --> 00:38:04.308]  Eric, you're on the air.
[00:38:04.968 --> 00:38:05.989]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:38:06.449 --> 00:38:09.612]  I saw Terror Storm, and it is indeed the battering ram of your movies.
[00:38:10.553 --> 00:38:13.115]  Charlie Sheen, bud, you have a fan for life.
[00:38:14.596 --> 00:38:19.440]  Charlie Sheen's activism in this whole area has raised this whole debate to a near quantum level.
[00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:21.902]  I want to make it a point also to show your movie
[00:38:23.065 --> 00:38:35.229]  To my sportsman's club, because a lot of times I've gone down to the range to dust off my old 1858 cap and ball Remington, and I've gotten into some debates with some of my fellow shooters, and they seem to think that George Bush is the bee's knees.
[00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:49.793]  I'll tell them a few things about Mr. Bush, and they kind of walk off the range after our discussion with a furrowed brow and a very worried look on their face when they realize he is for gun control, he is for open borders and everything else.
[00:38:51.034 --> 00:38:52.034]  And it's...
[00:38:52.992 --> 00:38:53.773]  It's kind of interesting.
[00:38:53.813 --> 00:39:01.837]  It's very eye-opening to see the confusion on their face when they kind of put down all the preconceived notions that they've been spoon-fed by these neocons.
[00:39:01.897 --> 00:39:02.818]  And they can't debate it.
[00:39:02.878 --> 00:39:08.501]  Bush is for an American Union, the end of our sovereignty, Associated Press, under orders of CFR.
[00:39:08.941 --> 00:39:17.106]  Even the AP admits the CFR wrote the plan, our government's implementing it, and Bush has doubled the size of the VATF.
[00:39:17.126 --> 00:39:18.907]  I'm told it's been increased even more now.
[00:39:19.407 --> 00:39:20.568]  First thing he did was double it.
[00:39:21.328 --> 00:39:22.189]  Oh yeah, Alex.
[00:39:22.209 --> 00:39:25.332]  These neocons are akin to bank robbers setting up a diversion.
[00:39:25.972 --> 00:39:26.613]  I mean, Tony Snow.
[00:39:43.524 --> 00:39:44.224]  No, that's okay, Alex.
[00:39:44.244 --> 00:39:46.986]  And I was shouting at the radio, and I'm saying, talk about the North American Union.
[00:39:47.006 --> 00:39:48.206]  And the whole thing was obviously staged.
[00:39:48.226 --> 00:39:48.366]  I mean...
[00:40:11.482 --> 00:40:14.725]  You know, I firmly believe they set these things up in advance.
[00:40:15.226 --> 00:40:16.607]  I mean, it's like the bank robbers.
[00:40:16.667 --> 00:40:23.594]  They set up, you know, they have a bunch of young punks on the other side of town busting windows and throwing eggs at cars, and then they'll go into the bank and rob.
[00:40:23.614 --> 00:40:25.056]  And that's the liberals, exactly.
[00:40:25.096 --> 00:40:29.460]  And then the fake conservatives, they go rob the bank.
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:30.081]  Yep.
[00:40:30.461 --> 00:40:31.702]  And one last question, Alex.
[00:40:31.742 --> 00:40:35.186]  I heard about this whole Warren Buffett and...
[00:40:36.295 --> 00:40:36.855]  Bill Gates.
[00:40:37.155 --> 00:40:39.016]  Oh, I'm so glad you brought that up.
[00:40:39.136 --> 00:40:40.857]  I keep forgetting to talk about it.
[00:40:40.917 --> 00:40:41.957]  Okay, well, here it is.
[00:40:42.997 --> 00:40:50.920]  Given Lytton Bionetics' involvement in the creation of the AIDS virus, they were a chief primate supplier to the military in the 60s and 70s.
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.020]  Yes, they were behind it, yes.
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:52.661]  Yep.
[00:40:53.041 --> 00:40:54.581]  Declassified documents.
[00:40:54.841 --> 00:40:55.842]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:40:55.942 --> 00:41:00.183]  And also Fort Detrick's involvement in this whole little charade.
[00:41:00.763 --> 00:41:05.625]  Here they're coming out, given all the suppressed cures for AIDS, given all the suppressed cures for cancer,
[00:41:06.647 --> 00:41:08.713]  My question to you, what's your take on this whole thing?
[00:41:08.753 --> 00:41:13.927]  Because with the technology we have, we could solve these problems within a month.
[00:41:14.454 --> 00:41:24.558]  How come they're all of a sudden doing this dog and pony show about all this money to all these... That's why I like to have nothing but open phones, because I got up Monday morning.
[00:41:25.339 --> 00:41:26.960]  He was making his announcement.
[00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:28.380]  He made it Sunday.
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:29.321]  I saw it Sunday.
[00:41:29.501 --> 00:41:32.042]  Then I read the details in USA Today.
[00:41:32.482 --> 00:41:38.525]  Monday morning, flew back to Texas, wrote notes on the plane about it, meant to write an article about it, never did it.
[00:41:38.865 --> 00:41:39.825]  I appreciate your call.
[00:41:39.845 --> 00:41:41.606]  Let me comment on what this is right now.
[00:41:42.282 --> 00:41:45.264]  At a multi-faceted, multi-tiered, multi-variant level.
[00:41:46.745 --> 00:41:49.087]  As simply as I can, without taking 20 minutes.
[00:41:51.068 --> 00:41:55.571]  The trust-busting of 1906 and the Sherman Antitrust Act was not real.
[00:41:58.273 --> 00:42:09.081]  The Rockefellers, the Carnegies, the Mellons, the Astors, and others, the Morgans, all British agents, that's all mainstream news, mainstream historical record now, it's not even hidden.
[00:42:10.606 --> 00:42:12.807]  They had billions of dollars apiece.
[00:42:13.067 --> 00:42:15.367]  Billions of dollars.
[00:42:16.127 --> 00:42:18.028]  And that was in 1906 money.
[00:42:18.048 --> 00:42:19.988]  That was the equivalent of almost a trillion.
[00:42:20.008 --> 00:42:22.489]  A billion was almost a trillion then.
[00:42:24.089 --> 00:42:26.710]  I mean, in 1918 you could buy a Model T for $150.
[00:42:30.291 --> 00:42:31.991]  Massive inflation these people have created.
[00:42:32.391 --> 00:42:33.131]  Robbing our wealth.
[00:42:34.292 --> 00:42:35.272]  But I digress.
[00:42:37.532 --> 00:42:40.894]  The Rockefellers were worth almost $3 billion in 1906.
[00:42:41.654 --> 00:42:43.355]  The Carnegies were worth almost $1 billion.
[00:42:43.635 --> 00:42:50.678]  And what they do is, they come in and they put their money in tax-free foundations.
[00:42:50.738 --> 00:42:52.159]  They build a Carnegie Hall.
[00:42:52.679 --> 00:42:54.120]  They endow some schools.
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:55.801]  They endow some hospitals.
[00:42:55.841 --> 00:42:57.922]  The hospitals still charge government money.
[00:42:58.262 --> 00:43:00.143]  And these things really run giant profits.
[00:43:00.443 --> 00:43:02.064]  Listen, I know a lot of really rich people.
[00:43:02.084 --> 00:43:02.924]  And let me tell you what they do.
[00:43:03.764 --> 00:43:05.065]  They put their money in trusts.
[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:10.762]  But only the super elite are allowed to put their money into really big foundations.
[00:43:12.283 --> 00:43:12.663]  Okay?
[00:43:13.624 --> 00:43:20.627]  And Bill Gates, with his $100 billion that he had when he shut up the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in what, 2001? 2000?
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:27.801]  Now you notice he's quote worth because his stock went down $47 billion last time I checked.
[00:43:27.841 --> 00:43:28.721]  It changes every day.
[00:43:29.021 --> 00:43:31.502]  But regardless, it might be $44 billion a day.
[00:43:31.522 --> 00:43:32.202]  It goes up and down.
[00:43:32.462 --> 00:43:34.343]  Some days it's $42 billion.
[00:43:34.363 --> 00:43:35.543]  Some days it's $51 billion.
[00:43:35.603 --> 00:43:36.223]  I don't know what it is.
[00:43:36.263 --> 00:43:37.683]  I'm just saying high 40s.
[00:43:39.324 --> 00:43:47.086]  That is nothing compared to the real wealth of the people that put their money into tax-free foundations exactly 100 years ago.
[00:43:49.068 --> 00:43:53.530]  In fact, I think the Sherman Antitrust Act went in during the summer.
[00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:56.091]  So it's almost 100 years.
[00:43:56.651 --> 00:43:57.631]  Almost a century.
[00:43:59.892 --> 00:44:03.654]  It's just like the Federal Reserve in 1913 was passed to, quote, get the bankers.
[00:44:03.674 --> 00:44:04.154]  Did you know that?
[00:44:04.214 --> 00:44:05.754]  Oh, this will punish the bankers.
[00:44:05.794 --> 00:44:07.215]  This will punish the corrupt bankers.
[00:44:07.315 --> 00:44:09.876]  People were aware of the banks then, manipulating things.
[00:44:10.356 --> 00:44:12.237]  And they actually funded newspapers to do that.
[00:44:12.297 --> 00:44:13.317]  That's all on the record now.
[00:44:13.337 --> 00:44:17.439]  Well, it was the same thing a few years earlier with the Sherman Antitrust Act.
[00:44:18.228 --> 00:44:18.648]  We're good to go.
[00:44:40.584 --> 00:44:44.727]  When you're in Canada, sometimes whole highways are shut down because the Queen says you can't use them.
[00:44:44.987 --> 00:44:46.548]  It's the exercise of authority.
[00:44:47.048 --> 00:44:48.989]  She owns the majority of BP stock.
[00:44:49.309 --> 00:44:53.632]  The Netherlands royalty owns the majority of the stock in Royal Dutch Shell.
[00:44:53.652 --> 00:44:54.853]  That's why it's called Royal Dutch Shell.
[00:44:54.873 --> 00:44:56.233]  They own cruise lines.
[00:44:57.334 --> 00:45:00.356]  Did you know they own Royal Caribbean?
[00:45:00.396 --> 00:45:05.779]  They own the majority of stock in car companies and media companies and defense companies.
[00:45:05.819 --> 00:45:07.600]  Car Law Group, number one shareholder.
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:09.101]  Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.
[00:45:11.303 --> 00:45:13.484]  What Elizabeth Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.
[00:45:14.364 --> 00:45:17.525]  And their power is so great that their subjects don't even know their names.
[00:45:17.905 --> 00:45:19.365]  Try to ask a Canadian subject.
[00:45:19.385 --> 00:45:20.686]  Try to ask a British subject.
[00:45:21.206 --> 00:45:25.787]  Try to ask an Australian subject or one of the other 50-plus commonwealths.
[00:45:27.548 --> 00:45:30.869]  You see, to get into what this Buffett thing is, we have to first give you background.
[00:45:32.089 --> 00:45:36.410]  They've got so much power that no one is even allowed to know their real name.
[00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:38.571]  When we got the Bilderberg Group list two weeks ago,
[00:45:39.491 --> 00:45:41.873]  Three weeks ago and posted it on Infowars.com.
[00:45:42.093 --> 00:45:43.514]  It has everyone's names.
[00:45:44.135 --> 00:45:45.416]  It has the Rockefellers' names.
[00:45:45.496 --> 00:45:47.758]  It has all these powerful people's names.
[00:45:48.078 --> 00:45:50.139]  But it just says, Her Majesty of the Netherlands.
[00:45:50.179 --> 00:45:52.141]  Her Royal Majesty of the Netherlands.
[00:45:55.263 --> 00:45:56.564]  And you're allowed to know her first name.
[00:45:56.624 --> 00:45:57.265]  It's Beatrix.
[00:45:58.526 --> 00:46:00.588]  Queen Beatrix, Her Royal Highness of the Netherlands.
[00:46:01.188 --> 00:46:01.929]  Queen Elizabeth.
[00:46:02.289 --> 00:46:03.210]  Princess Diana.
[00:46:04.571 --> 00:46:05.191]  Prince Philip.
[00:46:05.271 --> 00:46:06.052]  Prince Charles.
[00:46:06.152 --> 00:46:07.053]  Prince, Prince, Prince.
[00:46:07.573 --> 00:46:08.674]  Again, that's their power.
[00:46:10.245 --> 00:46:15.948]  And it really started because in most nations that had ruling monarchies in Europe, it was one family, and it still is.
[00:46:16.049 --> 00:46:17.149]  It's like a breed of dog.
[00:46:17.409 --> 00:46:18.290]  They're all intermarried.
[00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:22.192]  And the people in Germany don't want to know they've got a French king when that was going on.
[00:46:22.432 --> 00:46:24.614]  The people in Austria don't want to know that they have a French king.
[00:46:25.054 --> 00:46:26.035]  And then that got overthrown.
[00:46:26.055 --> 00:46:29.677]  And then the people of Britain don't want to know that they have a German dynasty running them.
[00:46:30.017 --> 00:46:31.118]  That's now the head dynasty.
[00:46:33.219 --> 00:46:33.939]  It's the same thing.
[00:46:33.959 --> 00:46:35.901]  So you're not even allowed to know their names, okay?
[00:46:36.321 --> 00:46:36.461]  So...
[00:46:37.418 --> 00:46:38.419]  Bill Gates is nothing.
[00:46:38.519 --> 00:46:42.681]  But Bill Gates was brought down to the principal's office.
[00:46:42.721 --> 00:46:43.741]  He was given a paddling.
[00:46:46.122 --> 00:46:47.923]  They said, you're now going to be a member of the real elite.
[00:46:48.364 --> 00:46:50.265]  You've got to put your money in a tax-free foundation.
[00:46:50.305 --> 00:46:51.245]  This always happens.
[00:46:52.746 --> 00:46:54.547]  And then you get to manage and run that.
[00:46:55.107 --> 00:47:02.871]  And other rich people, some of the new wealth, Rothschild agents like Warren Buffett, that guy's nothing compared to the Rothschilds and their wealth.
[00:47:02.891 --> 00:47:06.032]  He's got to put his $42 billion or whatever it is today in there.
[00:47:07.975 --> 00:47:14.799]  And so Buffett comes out and says of his $42 billion, he's going to put $37 billion in foundations.
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:19.402]  $30 billion of it in the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, a few billion into each of his sons.
[00:47:20.123 --> 00:47:21.503]  He meant to have his wife manage it.
[00:47:21.964 --> 00:47:25.406]  And they're putting it in there to, quote, fight AIDS and help vaccinate the children.
[00:47:26.727 --> 00:47:35.352]  Exact same thing that Ted Turner gave a billion dollars to do, what, in 1998, when he put his money in the Tax-Free Foundation.
[00:47:37.506 --> 00:47:38.767]  Gave it to the UN.
[00:47:39.147 --> 00:47:40.989]  And notice he pledged a billion dollars.
[00:47:41.569 --> 00:47:46.213]  Quote, of the profit of the foundation every year, it gets about $100 million.
[00:47:46.473 --> 00:47:49.716]  And since he put in a billion, he's put in several billion more.
[00:47:50.216 --> 00:47:51.357]  Almost all of his money.
[00:47:51.577 --> 00:47:54.380]  He puts it into tax-free foundations to buy up property.
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:57.302]  He's the biggest private land owner in the Southwest.
[00:47:58.623 --> 00:48:02.306]  You're driving through New Mexico and Arizona, it's just his property is everywhere.
[00:48:02.766 --> 00:48:03.287]  I've been there.
[00:48:04.483 --> 00:48:07.464]  I actually covered it in my film, America Destroyed by Design.
[00:48:09.545 --> 00:48:11.366]  My first documentary I made in 97.
[00:48:11.526 --> 00:48:14.447]  So, that's all Warren Buffett has done.
[00:48:14.547 --> 00:48:18.428]  He's putting his money, totally tax-free, into a system.
[00:48:18.608 --> 00:48:21.970]  And, by the way, Warren Buffett's made population control statements.
[00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:24.911]  Ted Turner has said that we need to kill the useless feeders.
[00:48:25.866 --> 00:48:34.493]  All these people that put money in these things to, quote, help the Africans and people, they also put money into big eugenics foundations under, you know, bioethics names.
[00:48:35.174 --> 00:48:38.236]  They're social Darwinists, Malthusian Malthus.
[00:48:39.097 --> 00:48:41.159]  And, I mean, how suspicious is that?
[00:48:41.259 --> 00:48:43.440]  Oh, we've got vaccines for the Africans.
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:44.301]  We love them so much.
[00:48:44.601 --> 00:48:47.584]  But at the same time, I think the population's overpopulated.
[00:48:48.344 --> 00:48:49.605]  I mean, can you put two and two together?
[00:48:49.705 --> 00:48:50.366]  I know you can't.
[00:48:52.287 --> 00:48:52.928]  We're good to go.
[00:48:52.968 --> 00:48:53.128]  I think?
[00:49:10.868 --> 00:49:28.851]  And then they just so happen to then suddenly love the little black people, and they've got shots for them, but the African tribes all over Africa, from sub-Saharan to northern Africa, it's all over BBC News, will run, and parents will cut their children's arms off after they're given vaccines, which I'm not advocating because it's too late.
[00:49:30.054 --> 00:49:31.976]  And they refuse the GMO food, all of it.
[00:49:31.996 --> 00:49:33.618]  The Africans are convinced it's killing them.
[00:49:33.938 --> 00:49:37.842]  And the studies show that people who've never had sexual contact, whose parents don't have it, they're getting it.
[00:49:37.862 --> 00:49:41.506]  And the only connection is, this was even mainstream British news, is the vaccines.
[00:49:41.546 --> 00:49:42.888]  They claim it's, quote, dirty needles.
[00:49:43.528 --> 00:49:45.050]  No, folks, it's what's in the vaccines.
[00:49:47.330 --> 00:49:48.950]  And so there you have it in a nutshell.
[00:49:49.170 --> 00:49:50.411]  The money goes tax-free.
[00:49:50.511 --> 00:50:02.193]  They use a very small portion of it each year in a big consortium to pay for injecting the Africans with their different vaccines and AIDS drugs that kill them and the rest of it.
[00:50:03.553 --> 00:50:04.373]  And it's sinister.
[00:50:04.433 --> 00:50:05.193]  It's so evil.
[00:50:06.274 --> 00:50:07.114]  It's so wicked.
[00:50:07.754 --> 00:50:10.154]  Right out in the open that people just can't face it.
[00:50:10.554 --> 00:50:13.495]  They just can't deal with it when we have the documents.
[00:50:15.183 --> 00:50:18.784]  And so, in a nutshell, to answer your question, that's exactly what's going on.
[00:50:18.824 --> 00:50:26.927]  Number one, they're just making their money tax-free, where they can then make profits, and then, oh, the mansions and the helicopters and the investments are all tax-free.
[00:50:27.627 --> 00:50:29.268]  They play by different rules than we do.
[00:50:29.932 --> 00:50:30.892]  And that's all that's happening.
[00:50:31.192 --> 00:50:42.195]  And then the other side of the equation is, it's then put into these big global government organizations, the lion's share of it being spent for special vaccines that I'm sure are wonderful.
[00:50:42.475 --> 00:50:48.516]  We just caught UN vaccines in a whole bunch of African countries with a hormone added to tetanus shots to sterilize women en masse.
[00:50:49.317 --> 00:50:51.097]  But of course, that's an accident too.
[00:50:52.319 --> 00:50:53.680]  These are loving elites.
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:55.761]  We need to just take our shots.
[00:50:56.461 --> 00:50:57.642]  They really care about us.
[00:50:58.082 --> 00:50:59.363]  We'll be back with more of your calls.
[00:50:59.383 --> 00:51:00.724]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.524 --> 00:51:05.886]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.066 --> 00:51:10.489]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.629 --> 00:51:15.011]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:15.051 --> 00:51:16.392]  The New World Order.
[00:51:17.132 --> 00:51:17.893]  Can emerge.
[00:51:18.173 --> 00:51:22.398]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.458 --> 00:51:29.386]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.526 --> 00:51:31.529]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.909 --> 00:51:42.254]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.514 --> 00:51:47.877]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:51:48.397 --> 00:51:51.038]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:51:51.138 --> 00:51:51.719]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:51.739 --> 00:51:52.159]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:52.179 --> 00:51:53.440]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:52:01.374 --> 00:52:02.015]  We're good to go.
[00:52:23.099 --> 00:52:29.583]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:52:29.763 --> 00:52:34.867]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:52:34.967 --> 00:52:43.853]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:52:44.113 --> 00:52:47.416]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[00:52:57.499 --> 00:52:58.940]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:08.382]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:08.602 --> 00:53:10.863]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:53:11.063 --> 00:53:15.404]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, Colloidal Silver 500 ppm, Olive Leaf Extract,
[00:53:17.745 --> 00:53:18.405]  We're good to go.
[00:53:40.356 --> 00:53:40.997]  We're good to go.
[00:54:12.588 --> 00:54:17.632]  We'll start the next hour and go right to Matt, James, Sasha, Jeff, Jason, and others.
[00:54:17.692 --> 00:54:27.318]  But yesterday, in the middle of the second hour, I go to Jim Dillon, who I know, politically involved here in town, and we confirm this was Rick Perry.
[00:54:28.135 --> 00:54:29.335]  And I didn't believe it at first.
[00:54:29.415 --> 00:54:32.997]  And he's talking to me there at the Capitol about how they stole his signs.
[00:54:33.077 --> 00:54:36.578]  And all of a sudden he goes, hey, it's Governor Perry.
[00:54:36.598 --> 00:54:39.659]  So I bumble around going, is this really the governor?
[00:54:39.719 --> 00:54:40.599]  Is this really the governor?
[00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:43.960]  And then he just really says some hilarious things.
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:45.221]  He's a horrible creature.
[00:54:45.241 --> 00:54:49.102]  He's for open borders and a bunch of other bad things, the NAFTA highway.
[00:54:49.522 --> 00:54:52.323]  So this happened just a few miles away from us.
[00:54:53.023 --> 00:54:54.584]  I just so happened to go to Jim Dillon.
[00:54:55.570 --> 00:55:05.734]  Right when he was there at the Capitol, complaining about what happened to him this weekend, being arrested, and out walks the governor, and the governor takes the phone when they say, it's Alex Jones.
[00:55:05.774 --> 00:55:06.755]  So, here it is.
[00:55:07.315 --> 00:55:08.856]  Said you hadn't reserved the spot.
[00:55:11.457 --> 00:55:13.257]  Well, I didn't like what I was saying, Alex.
[00:55:13.618 --> 00:55:16.279]  Let me just ask you, because we always... Hey, Governor Perry, how are you?
[00:55:16.319 --> 00:55:18.240]  Let me just... Alex, Governor Perry, right here.
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:19.260]  Yes, sir.
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:20.220]  Glad to meet you, sir.
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:21.141]  Here's Alex Jones.
[00:55:21.161 --> 00:55:21.901]  We'd like to talk to him.
[00:55:21.941 --> 00:55:23.822]  What are you doing, Brother Jones?
[00:55:25.527 --> 00:55:26.568]  Hello, Rick Perry.
[00:55:26.748 --> 00:55:28.089]  You holding down the fork there?
[00:55:28.189 --> 00:55:29.149]  He sure is.
[00:55:29.209 --> 00:55:29.909]  As always.
[00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:31.210]  Is this really Rick Perry?
[00:55:31.830 --> 00:55:32.871]  Oh, get out of here.
[00:55:33.151 --> 00:55:37.013]  You don't think your man here would try to trick you, do you?
[00:55:37.754 --> 00:55:39.475]  No, I don't think he would.
[00:55:40.175 --> 00:55:41.616]  It's him, Alex.
[00:55:41.696 --> 00:55:42.036]  It's him.
[00:55:42.176 --> 00:55:45.278]  Alex, you know he would not pull the wool over your eye.
[00:55:46.298 --> 00:55:49.440]  No, it sounds like Rick Perry.
[00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:50.260]  I know I do.
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:51.561]  I do sound like him, don't I?
[00:55:52.037 --> 00:55:52.317]  It is.
[00:55:52.517 --> 00:55:53.918]  And I look like him, too, don't I?
[00:55:54.118 --> 00:55:58.079]  Well, Governor, okay, okay, did you see me in a Mexican food restaurant?
[00:55:59.340 --> 00:56:01.060]  No, were you there last night?
[00:56:03.061 --> 00:56:04.682]  Did I see you at Louisville Young?
[00:56:05.262 --> 00:56:07.783]  No, no, no, not last night.
[00:56:07.883 --> 00:56:10.724]  I was at Wero's last night.
[00:56:11.324 --> 00:56:12.425]  This isn't the Governor.
[00:56:12.465 --> 00:56:15.906]  Governor, did I bullhorn you and Vicente Fox?
[00:56:16.866 --> 00:56:17.707]  No, you did that.
[00:56:18.567 --> 00:56:19.587]  You totally did that.
[00:56:20.548 --> 00:56:21.348]  Out in front of the house.
[00:56:22.202 --> 00:56:24.384]  And you were sweating like a hog, man.
[00:56:24.484 --> 00:56:25.164]  No.
[00:56:25.465 --> 00:56:26.486]  You were hot.
[00:56:26.926 --> 00:56:29.128]  You were boiling hot out there, Jones.
[00:56:29.868 --> 00:56:33.271]  Well, that's in the air conditioning.
[00:56:33.311 --> 00:56:35.513]  So why are you stopping and talking to Jim, Governor?
[00:56:35.553 --> 00:56:36.434]  He's running against you.
[00:56:36.894 --> 00:56:40.637]  Because he was just standing up here and he said, come on, let's visit.
[00:56:40.677 --> 00:56:41.277]  So we did.
[00:56:42.038 --> 00:56:42.699]  Why wouldn't I?
[00:56:43.699 --> 00:56:46.942]  You think I'm not a personable kind of guy?
[00:56:47.442 --> 00:56:48.003]  No, Governor.
[00:56:48.023 --> 00:56:49.084]  I think you're very personable.
[00:56:49.124 --> 00:56:50.205]  You know I am.
[00:56:50.525 --> 00:56:51.586]  You know I am.
[00:56:53.648 --> 00:56:55.489]  Okay, is this really Rick Perry?
[00:56:56.949 --> 00:56:57.770]  No way.
[00:56:57.790 --> 00:56:59.691]  I know.
[00:57:00.731 --> 00:57:03.593]  He's proselyting me now.
[00:57:03.853 --> 00:57:06.074]  And I'm telling him, I said, he's got a long way to go.
[00:57:06.094 --> 00:57:07.755]  Proselytizing.
[00:57:08.295 --> 00:57:09.156]  Well, I'm an Aggie.
[00:57:09.356 --> 00:57:11.457]  You know, that's as close as I can get, man.
[00:57:11.937 --> 00:57:15.139]  All right, Jonesy, I've got to go have lunch with my wife.
[00:57:15.179 --> 00:57:16.019]  Hold on, Governor.
[00:57:16.079 --> 00:57:17.660]  Are you going to secure our border?
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:18.801]  Our border?
[00:57:18.841 --> 00:57:20.702]  We are securing it as you speak, brother.
[00:57:21.809 --> 00:57:27.814]  We're making better progress than anybody else is, I'll tell you that.
[00:57:27.854 --> 00:57:30.195]  We're just monitoring stations and cameras down there.
[00:57:30.215 --> 00:57:31.617]  We're not armed troops.
[00:57:31.797 --> 00:57:32.877]  We're moving on that way.
[00:57:33.018 --> 00:57:33.638]  It's serious.
[00:57:33.818 --> 00:57:34.359]  Bye, Governor.
[00:57:34.379 --> 00:57:34.979]  Thank you, sir.
[00:57:35.519 --> 00:57:36.180]  Take care.
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:37.541]  Was that really Perry?
[00:57:37.681 --> 00:57:40.403]  I hate to put you on the spot.
[00:57:40.643 --> 00:57:42.745]  And that really was Rick Perry.
[00:57:42.925 --> 00:57:50.091]  I imagine you just go to the next caller, and Jim's talking about how they pulled a police state action on him there at the...
[00:57:51.061 --> 00:57:56.425]  They're at the Capitol across the street from the Governor's Mansion, and then Rick Perry comes waddling out of the thing.
[00:57:56.565 --> 00:57:57.326]  Oh, my goodness.
[00:57:58.087 --> 00:58:01.950]  Now we'll see if Perry's got the courage to come on.
[00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:05.392]  I know he wouldn't come in studio, but we're going to try that.
[00:58:05.433 --> 00:58:15.941]  We're not very far away from the Governor's Mansion, about five miles, maybe less, and we're going to see if we can at least get him over the telephone for a proper grilling on the NAFTA highways in the American Union.
[00:58:16.886 --> 00:58:17.886]  So we'll see if that'll happen.
[00:58:18.147 --> 00:58:19.347]  All right, I promise to re-air that.
[00:58:19.367 --> 00:58:20.087]  A lot of you missed it.
[00:58:20.347 --> 00:58:23.049]  You listen on the AM and FM stations and can't go listen to it on the Internet.
[00:58:24.129 --> 00:58:25.830]  Or you listen on shortwave or satellite.
[00:58:25.890 --> 00:58:26.630]  So we re-aired it.
[00:58:26.690 --> 00:58:27.410]  There it is for you.
[00:58:28.131 --> 00:58:29.291]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:30.091 --> 00:58:32.232]  We will start the second hour.
[00:58:32.912 --> 00:58:34.533]  And we will go straight to your phone calls.
[00:58:34.573 --> 00:58:35.393]  It's open phones, 800-259-9231.
[00:58:35.413 --> 00:58:35.674]  Stay with us.

[00:58:46.779 --> 00:58:47.259]  Big Brother.
[00:58:47.439 --> 00:58:48.300]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:52.042]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:52.082 --> 00:58:54.363]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.418 --> 00:59:05.298]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.318 --> 00:59:09.901]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.161 --> 00:59:14.283]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.403 --> 00:59:19.585]  Now into the second hour on this live Thursday, the 29th day of June 2006.
[00:59:19.625 --> 00:59:25.908]  Do you believe the year is already half over, more than half over?
[00:59:28.149 --> 00:59:29.110]  Or just at half over?
[00:59:29.170 --> 00:59:29.610]  Amazing.
[00:59:30.865 --> 00:59:31.665]  Open phones.
[00:59:32.266 --> 00:59:32.666]  I love it.
[00:59:32.706 --> 00:59:38.468]  The callers bring up the different issues, different items, things that I'd forgotten to talk about or things I'd wanted to talk about or things I didn't even know about.
[00:59:39.208 --> 00:59:42.790]  We go to call sometime and boom, suddenly the governor of Texas is on the phone.
[00:59:43.290 --> 00:59:44.530]  So that's what's so fun about it.
[00:59:44.851 --> 00:59:46.871]  An informative, dynamic 1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:46.891 --> 00:59:55.915]  A bunch of news we're going to be getting to as well coming up later in this hour, like the
[00:59:56.491 --> 00:59:57.651]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[00:59:57.671 --> 01:00:00.712]  Sorry, I don't have Governor Rendell right next to me from Pennsylvania.
[01:00:21.063 --> 01:00:23.464]  I just watched a new movie, Terror Storm, and it's excellent.
[01:00:23.624 --> 01:00:25.045]  It's better than Martial Law.
[01:00:25.405 --> 01:00:26.545]  I thought Martial Law was the best.
[01:00:26.605 --> 01:00:28.506]  I'm going to start handing out Terror Storm instead.
[01:00:28.766 --> 01:00:30.446]  I got to get a copy of that and everything.
[01:00:31.187 --> 01:00:31.507]  Good.
[01:00:32.347 --> 01:00:37.289]  And I actually got a book yesterday about Secret Societies, and it had Bohemian Grove in there.
[01:00:37.369 --> 01:00:38.769]  However, it did not mention your name.
[01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:41.270]  Well, that's fine.
[01:00:41.290 --> 01:00:41.710]  I don't care.
[01:00:42.131 --> 01:00:46.132]  Well, I know, but I was just surprised about that.
[01:00:46.152 --> 01:00:48.953]  Okay, what else is on your mind?
[01:00:49.674 --> 01:00:56.979]  No, I was talking about something about Iran coming up, where if they don't have an answer by July 5th, something's going to happen or something like that.
[01:00:56.999 --> 01:00:57.319]  That's right.
[01:00:57.379 --> 01:00:59.420]  Bush is saying they don't have until mid-August.
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:04.083]  He said they've just got a few weeks, and that was about a week ago, or they may have to go ahead and attack them.
[01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:07.531]  Do you believe that they're going to use a pretext or anything?
[01:01:07.591 --> 01:01:10.533]  Like, I hate to say that, but... They could do anything.
[01:01:10.573 --> 01:01:16.416]  Our government could bomb some other nation and blame it on Iran, or Iran could get stupid and really could do something.
[01:01:16.476 --> 01:01:16.896]  I doubt it.
[01:01:17.717 --> 01:01:22.199]  Or our government can attack Iran, and then when they fight back, it'll be, oh, can you believe them?
[01:01:22.499 --> 01:01:23.540]  They actually fought back.
[01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:25.421]  The greatest evil in history has been committed.
[01:01:25.761 --> 01:01:26.361]  That's horrible.
[01:01:26.401 --> 01:01:27.562]  We can't have these people in power.
[01:01:28.450 --> 01:01:29.970]  Well, it's order out of chaos.
[01:01:30.010 --> 01:01:32.731]  They need to accelerate the crisis and then get the power.
[01:01:33.051 --> 01:01:33.771]  Thanks for the call.
[01:01:33.791 --> 01:01:35.291]  Good to hear from you, Matt.
[01:01:35.391 --> 01:01:36.772]  James in Virginia.
[01:01:36.812 --> 01:01:37.492]  You're on the air.
[01:01:37.532 --> 01:01:38.812]  Welcome.
[01:01:38.832 --> 01:01:38.872]  Hi.
[01:01:39.332 --> 01:01:40.412]  Good to be here.
[01:01:41.032 --> 01:01:42.453]  I want to talk about a treaty.
[01:01:42.633 --> 01:01:44.533]  It's called the Cybercrime Treaty.
[01:01:45.413 --> 01:01:54.155]  And what this treaty is going to do is it's going to make it a lot easier for foreign governments to request the FBI to dig through you and your Internet accounts
[01:01:55.024 --> 01:02:05.372]  Well, more than that, the foreign governments are also moving right now, that was in the news yesterday in Computer World, to get control of the web and put the web under EU rules that restrict free speech.
[01:02:05.932 --> 01:02:12.437]  We also have them trying to shut down Internet 1 and force us over to Internet 2 that restricts speech and bandwidth.
[01:02:12.878 --> 01:02:14.399]  So a lot of serious things are happening.
[01:02:14.619 --> 01:02:15.259]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:02:15.299 --> 01:02:18.782]  This treaty was negotiated under something called the Council of Europe.
[01:02:19.383 --> 01:02:19.723]  Yes.
[01:02:19.803 --> 01:02:22.645]  And it was negotiated by the Justice Departments.
[01:02:23.243 --> 01:02:26.204]  It's been negotiated with the Justice Department and ICANN right now.
[01:02:26.604 --> 01:02:26.864]  Yeah.
[01:02:27.184 --> 01:02:38.888]  Well, it's kind of a slightly separate issue, but the point is a lot of the stuff you were just talking about, about freedom of speech issues, there's no what they call dual criminality provision in this treaty.
[01:02:38.968 --> 01:02:44.669]  So the only... I'm trying to put this in words.
[01:02:45.210 --> 01:02:52.952]  The Justice Department and the White House, the only answer they have is to trust us that they won't prosecute you for hate crimes based in Europe
[01:02:53.427 --> 01:02:54.708]  Based on what you put on the web.
[01:02:54.748 --> 01:02:55.828]  They won't investigate.
[01:02:55.868 --> 01:02:57.449]  Well, our government's already moving.
[01:02:57.569 --> 01:02:58.930]  I mean, look at free speech everywhere.
[01:02:58.990 --> 01:03:04.774]  The Supreme Court rules whistleblowers don't have protection when they discover crime in the federal government or state government.
[01:03:05.694 --> 01:03:10.737]  We have them now trying to prosecute New York Times reporters that report on illegal NSA spying.
[01:03:11.577 --> 01:03:14.319]  We have them arresting people for wearing Peace on Earth t-shirts.
[01:03:14.999 --> 01:03:18.161]  I mean, there is an attack on the First Amendment here, big time.
[01:03:18.381 --> 01:03:21.183]  Yeah, so what's going on is they're going to try to
[01:03:21.755 --> 01:03:25.056]  Sneak this through and pass it through the Senate in the next couple weeks.
[01:03:25.236 --> 01:03:28.376]  And if you don't mind, I'd like to give out Bill Frisch's phone number.
[01:03:28.416 --> 01:03:32.737]  Sure, give it out.
[01:03:32.757 --> 01:03:33.977]  It's 202-224-3344.
[01:03:34.397 --> 01:03:38.478]  Call and say you don't want the Cybercrime Treaty to go through on unanimous consent.
[01:03:38.518 --> 01:03:39.438]  You want a real debate.
[01:03:39.918 --> 01:03:44.339]  And just Google Cybercrime Treaty to get more info on it if you want some background.
[01:03:44.499 --> 01:03:45.019]  I hear you.
[01:03:45.039 --> 01:03:45.619]  Good job.
[01:03:45.679 --> 01:03:46.659]  Thanks for the call.
[01:03:47.099 --> 01:03:49.700]  We'll come right back and go to Sasha and many others.
[01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:50.900]  Keep it locked in.
[01:03:54.784 --> 01:03:57.626]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.887 --> 01:03:58.587]  Hello, my friends.
[01:03:58.687 --> 01:03:59.468]  Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.808 --> 01:04:04.492]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.832 --> 01:04:11.558]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:11.738 --> 01:04:12.259]  We're good to go.
[01:04:30.057 --> 01:04:33.738]  And uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:05.481]  Well, so does he.

[01:07:18.569 --> 01:07:19.750]  Doing what we should.
[01:07:19.850 --> 01:07:21.611]  Standing up against the New World Order.
[01:07:21.631 --> 01:07:23.232]  Fighting them morning, noon, and night.
[01:07:23.852 --> 01:07:25.133]  Burning the midnight oiled.
[01:07:25.925 --> 01:07:27.767]  Keeping the home fires burning.
[01:07:28.127 --> 01:07:32.871]  Holding down the fort right here from the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:07:33.692 --> 01:07:36.814]  We are waging war on corruption with our secret weapon.
[01:07:37.355 --> 01:07:38.696]  It's not a secret any longer.
[01:07:38.836 --> 01:07:39.537]  It's the truth.
[01:07:39.917 --> 01:07:43.560]  And there are mountains of lies cannot stand against the truth.
[01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:44.561]  Welcome back.
[01:07:45.848 --> 01:08:01.071]  I love having open phones, just taking calls, because the last caller brought up the attack on the Internet, the attempts to restrict free speech, the attempts to shut down the old web and put you onto a new web, Internet 2, that restricts free speech and rips you off, charging you ridiculous prices.
[01:08:02.112 --> 01:08:02.973]  It's happening.
[01:08:02.993 --> 01:08:06.096]  Just like they took over the public airways, they're taking over the web right now.
[01:08:06.116 --> 01:08:07.117]  So we'll get more into that later.
[01:08:07.137 --> 01:08:08.339]  I have several articles on that.
[01:08:08.719 --> 01:08:10.461]  Let's see what the next caller brings up.
[01:08:10.501 --> 01:08:14.585]  Sasha's up next, but we've got to skip her because Tim in Korea is a first-time caller.
[01:08:14.946 --> 01:08:16.708]  Tim in Korea, you're on the air.
[01:08:16.728 --> 01:08:18.069]  Hi, Alex.
[01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:21.212]  I'm up listening to you every night from 1 a.m.
[01:08:21.232 --> 01:08:21.573]  to 4 a.m.
[01:08:21.653 --> 01:08:22.474]  here in Korea.
[01:08:23.423 --> 01:08:25.824]  I just saw your new film, Terror Storm.
[01:08:25.884 --> 01:08:26.904]  I think it's phenomenal.
[01:08:27.004 --> 01:08:28.025]  Are you in the military?
[01:08:28.065 --> 01:08:29.065]  Are you a computer guy?
[01:08:29.105 --> 01:08:30.026]  No, I'm not.
[01:08:30.286 --> 01:08:32.106]  I'm teaching in international schools here.
[01:08:32.386 --> 01:08:32.787]  Oh, cool.
[01:08:32.867 --> 01:08:33.747]  Okay, well, welcome, Tim.
[01:08:34.207 --> 01:08:35.007]  Yeah.
[01:08:35.187 --> 01:08:41.270]  Actually, the reason I called, I wanted to get your comment on... There was an article before you went to the L.A.
[01:08:41.310 --> 01:08:45.551]  conference about the Freedom of Information Act request.
[01:08:45.871 --> 01:08:46.151]  Yes.
[01:08:46.772 --> 01:08:49.533]  And you'd credited it to AP, and of course you spent quite a...
[01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:55.645]  Considerable amount of time on June 20th radio show talking about this.
[01:08:55.705 --> 01:09:00.749]  As it turns out, I think it was not an AP article, so I was hoping you could clarify exactly what happened.
[01:09:00.769 --> 01:09:01.911]  Okay, state that again.
[01:09:01.951 --> 01:09:03.372]  What specifically are you talking about?
[01:09:03.872 --> 01:09:06.635]  The Jerome Corsi's Freedom of Information Act.
[01:09:09.111 --> 01:09:35.978]  I had three articles by Jerome Corsi, several articles about Jerome Corsi, and yes, the Associated Press did report and did pick it up, and the Associated Press did, in its comments about Corsi, come out and say that it, quote, appeared that the CFR, that they were implementing a CFR plan.
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:41.162]  Okay, I couldn't find an Associated Press report on that.
[01:09:41.182 --> 01:09:42.943]  I could only find it on WorldNetDaily.
[01:09:44.924 --> 01:09:46.085]  Well, I'll tell you what I'll do.
[01:09:46.145 --> 01:09:52.187]  I know my guys are listening right now, and so I don't have the article here in front of me.
[01:09:53.108 --> 01:09:54.409]  Okay, that's fine.
[01:09:54.469 --> 01:09:54.889]  I understand.
[01:09:54.929 --> 01:09:56.169]  I mean, I made a big deal out of it.
[01:09:56.249 --> 01:10:01.432]  I even commented on it and read it on air, and it was AP.
[01:10:02.512 --> 01:10:03.393]  Okay, I hope it was.
[01:10:03.413 --> 01:10:04.173]  No, it was.
[01:10:04.213 --> 01:10:04.593]  It was AP.
[01:10:06.156 --> 01:10:07.056]  It was phenomenal.
[01:10:07.337 --> 01:10:09.017]  It's going to be a great wake-up tool, I think.
[01:10:09.718 --> 01:10:10.798]  So keep up the good work, Alex.
[01:10:11.238 --> 01:10:11.618]  Thank you.
[01:10:11.658 --> 01:10:13.179]  How long have you been in Korea?
[01:10:13.839 --> 01:10:14.720]  For about three years.
[01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:18.441]  Did you know about the show before you went, or did you learn about it there?
[01:10:18.941 --> 01:10:19.782]  I learned about it here.
[01:10:19.802 --> 01:10:24.384]  I have a friend in America, and we listen every night and talk on MSN about it.
[01:10:24.804 --> 01:10:30.666]  And I've been handing out films to the international teachers here from Canada and America.
[01:10:30.686 --> 01:10:33.567]  Are any of the Korean people aware of what's going on?
[01:10:33.587 --> 01:10:33.627]  No.
[01:10:36.231 --> 01:10:36.871]  Not so much.
[01:10:38.132 --> 01:10:41.513]  The Korean media has very strong control over the people.
[01:10:43.274 --> 01:10:44.975]  People here tend to be compliant.
[01:10:45.355 --> 01:10:50.217]  It's a very monoculture type of society.
[01:10:51.497 --> 01:10:54.298]  They kind of like to be enslaved by the New World Order, I think.
[01:10:54.318 --> 01:10:57.019]  Yeah, that's what I picked up about South Korea.
[01:10:57.039 --> 01:10:58.520]  You really couldn't call it a free country.
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:01.881]  They're always arresting people for what they say about the government.
[01:11:01.901 --> 01:11:02.382]  That's right.
[01:11:03.717 --> 01:11:06.959]  There are a lot of protests here about local issues.
[01:11:07.039 --> 01:11:13.864]  I don't always keep up with them, but I do see, you know, especially like the big issue is getting the military out of Korea.
[01:11:13.904 --> 01:11:15.505]  There's always protests about that.
[01:11:16.806 --> 01:11:17.526]  Getting the U.S.
[01:11:17.566 --> 01:11:18.146]  military out?
[01:11:18.166 --> 01:11:18.887]  Getting the U.S.
[01:11:18.967 --> 01:11:19.107]  out.
[01:11:19.167 --> 01:11:32.476]  They're building what I believe will be one of the largest military bases here in Pyeongtaek in Korea, and there's been protests about that and people protesting about getting their land taken.
[01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:34.420]  Refusing to give up their land.
[01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:36.281]  So they are active on these issues.
[01:11:37.041 --> 01:11:38.822]  Yeah, they get in big fights with the police.
[01:11:38.882 --> 01:11:39.382]  I've seen it.
[01:11:40.202 --> 01:11:41.062]  I mean, they don't play games.
[01:11:41.082 --> 01:11:46.044]  They put bandanas on, they have sticks, the police have sticks, and they run into each other.
[01:11:46.084 --> 01:11:47.524]  It's like Gladiator or something.
[01:11:48.064 --> 01:11:54.106]  Yeah, I was at the airport the other day and I noticed the airport police are carrying machine guns with them.
[01:11:55.286 --> 01:11:56.947]  I'll try to get a photo of that for you.
[01:11:57.970 --> 01:11:59.431]  Well, worldwide that's happening.
[01:11:59.451 --> 01:12:01.272]  9-11's been used as a pretext for that.
[01:12:01.712 --> 01:12:03.373]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[01:12:03.413 --> 01:12:04.754]  Thank you for joining us from Korea.
[01:12:05.094 --> 01:12:05.854]  Please spread the word.
[01:12:05.874 --> 01:12:06.875]  It's good to have you on board.
[01:12:10.637 --> 01:12:26.626]  To my staff, I haven't gotten my laptop back in the office since I got back into town, or I'd be doing the Google search right now, but I tend not to like to do Google searches while I'm on air because I get focused on it and then don't do a good broadcast, but
[01:12:28.052 --> 01:12:29.834]  It's the first time we had Corsi on.
[01:12:29.854 --> 01:12:31.274]  We had him on twice in the last few weeks.
[01:12:31.314 --> 01:12:33.456]  But it was the first interview, guys.
[01:12:34.096 --> 01:12:35.757]  Go back to whatever date that was.
[01:12:35.817 --> 01:12:44.482]  And under him, under his picture in the guest section of that day, I know we had the AP article posted in our format saved there.
[01:12:45.003 --> 01:12:48.265]  So just for that listener, can we please find that AP and repost it?
[01:12:48.725 --> 01:12:50.406]  Because that is important and that is a big deal.
[01:12:52.988 --> 01:12:55.829]  That's the only problem with Google is if you don't have something similar to the headline.
[01:12:55.849 --> 01:12:56.990]  I'm trying to remember the headline.
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:03.363]  Something like Bush enacting American Union.
[01:13:03.383 --> 01:13:09.286]  No, no, it was documents sought on Bush-American Union.
[01:13:09.346 --> 01:13:10.187]  I think that's it.
[01:13:10.247 --> 01:13:14.889]  Yeah, documents sought or Freedom of Information Act request.
[01:13:14.949 --> 01:13:16.310]  Something like that was the headline.
[01:13:16.330 --> 01:13:23.534]  And it's the last two paragraphs that are key in it where the AP talks about the CFR calling the shots.
[01:13:23.594 --> 01:13:26.976]  And then, sir, you did Jerome Corsi searches about his particular article.
[01:13:27.526 --> 01:13:33.327]  And I guess what you found then was the articles he himself had written or articles written by other people.
[01:13:33.367 --> 01:13:35.588]  But it was the Associated Press.
[01:13:35.968 --> 01:13:37.048]  Sasha in Missouri.
[01:13:37.068 --> 01:13:38.228]  Thank you for holding, Sasha.
[01:13:38.468 --> 01:13:39.168]  You're on the air.
[01:13:39.809 --> 01:13:40.909]  Good afternoon, Mr. Jones.
[01:13:41.109 --> 01:13:41.449]  Welcome.
[01:13:42.789 --> 01:13:43.890]  A couple quick questions.
[01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:52.091]  And I want to thank you and your staff and a lot of the people who are in this fight right now against the PNACers and the New World Order CFRs.
[01:13:53.091 --> 01:13:54.632]  You guys are really putting yourselves out there right now.
[01:13:54.652 --> 01:13:55.432]  I really got to commend you.
[01:13:56.747 --> 01:13:57.428]  We don't have a choice.
[01:13:57.468 --> 01:13:59.028]  Somebody's got to stand up against these crooks.
[01:13:59.589 --> 01:14:00.189]  I agree fully.
[01:14:00.209 --> 01:14:02.070]  I mean, they're more than crooks.
[01:14:02.090 --> 01:14:05.172]  They're psychopathic, bloodthirsty killers, and I'm sick of them.
[01:14:06.012 --> 01:14:06.573]  It's murderous.
[01:14:06.793 --> 01:14:07.593]  It fully is.
[01:14:07.633 --> 01:14:08.894]  And there's really no better word for it.
[01:14:10.675 --> 01:14:12.136]  Could I ask you a couple quick questions?
[01:14:13.096 --> 01:14:13.597]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:14:14.497 --> 01:14:18.799]  Any word yet on when the C-SPAN will air the L.A.
[01:14:18.819 --> 01:14:19.700]  conference that you guys did?
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:21.341]  You know, it's driving me up the wall.
[01:14:22.228 --> 01:14:35.860]  When we talked to their scheduler in programming or whatever it was, back on Thursday when they said they were going to come, and then Friday they confirmed, and then Saturday they checked it out, and then Sunday they taped about, well, to be exact, an hour, 48 minutes, 10 seconds.
[01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:37.681]  That's when I cut off the panel discussion.
[01:14:37.701 --> 01:14:40.003]  They said I could have between an hour and a half and two hours.
[01:14:40.043 --> 01:14:41.404]  Better to cut it off before two hours.
[01:14:41.785 --> 01:14:48.490]  And then they said, they had told us before they got there, a separate group from the crew, that, well, you know, it could air as early as Wednesday.
[01:14:48.530 --> 01:14:49.351]  It normally does.
[01:14:50.023 --> 01:14:50.584]  We're good to go.
[01:15:14.486 --> 01:15:18.910]  And I tend to believe them because they don't even have the full schedule for tomorrow posted.
[01:15:19.330 --> 01:15:23.294]  They don't have a schedule really posted on C-SPAN 1 for Saturday or Sunday.
[01:15:23.794 --> 01:15:25.095]  But they say they're going to air it.
[01:15:25.135 --> 01:15:25.876]  It was powerful.
[01:15:25.916 --> 01:15:29.960]  It'll be the most powerful 9-11 information ever on C-SPAN because I've seen it all.
[01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:33.643]  They've probably done about, I don't know, five or six different presentations by people like us before.
[01:15:34.323 --> 01:15:35.605]  And I am chomping at the bit.
[01:15:35.645 --> 01:15:36.846]  It will be historical.
[01:15:36.906 --> 01:15:38.087]  They say they're going to air it.
[01:15:41.071 --> 01:15:42.512]  I'm not telling people to even call them.
[01:15:42.852 --> 01:15:44.672]  People did call them and get them to come to the event.
[01:15:44.712 --> 01:15:45.933]  Now they've come and shot the event.
[01:15:46.393 --> 01:15:48.094]  They had a big crew there for C-SPAN.
[01:15:48.734 --> 01:15:50.194]  And so we'll see what happens.
[01:15:50.214 --> 01:15:52.295]  Well, I certainly hope they do, Eric.
[01:15:53.976 --> 01:15:55.837]  And I saw Terror Storm.
[01:15:56.257 --> 01:15:59.038]  I love the doublespeak stuff and the 7-7 stuff.
[01:15:59.058 --> 01:15:59.878]  I thought that was great.
[01:16:00.238 --> 01:16:05.300]  I wonder if you're going to add maybe the Jack Wood interview with Tim Russert if you do another documentary?
[01:16:06.621 --> 01:16:07.821]  Well, that's an audio interview.
[01:16:08.573 --> 01:16:11.334]  Yeah, but the stuff in there was really revealing.
[01:16:11.374 --> 01:16:16.696]  I mean, Tim Russell was ducking questions constantly, and then he tried to pull some strange stuff with a beeping phone to get off the air.
[01:16:16.996 --> 01:16:17.296]  Yeah.
[01:16:17.776 --> 01:16:18.396]  That was terrible.
[01:16:18.716 --> 01:16:19.137]  Interesting.
[01:16:19.157 --> 01:16:20.497]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:16:20.517 --> 01:16:21.457]  Oh, all right.
[01:16:21.877 --> 01:16:22.198]  You bet.
[01:16:22.218 --> 01:16:23.478]  Good to have you on board.
[01:16:23.498 --> 01:16:26.659]  Yeah, so the word is in on Terror Storm.
[01:16:27.139 --> 01:16:28.079]  People really like it.
[01:16:28.119 --> 01:16:28.700]  That's exciting.
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:35.742]  I spent, I keep saying three times, it was almost four times as much money on this as I've spent on any previous film.
[01:16:36.847 --> 01:16:39.508]  And I'm deeply in the hole on it, but I frankly don't care.
[01:16:39.928 --> 01:16:41.109]  It is my passion.
[01:16:41.969 --> 01:16:52.714]  It is my passion to get the truth out, do the best job we can, the best graphics, the best information, from Chicago to London to Crawford, Texas, shot all over the place.
[01:16:53.582 --> 01:17:00.305]  And it is now available on DVD, or you can get it by going to prisonplanet.tv and see it online right now for 15 cents a day.
[01:17:00.746 --> 01:17:09.330]  Get a weekly membership, well, a monthly membership for $5.95, the cost of three cups of coffee, or get a yearly membership and get three months free, and download and burn copies of it.
[01:17:09.370 --> 01:17:10.390]  Great activist tool.
[01:17:11.611 --> 01:17:13.272]  Let's go to Jeff in Arizona.
[01:17:13.332 --> 01:17:14.472]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[01:17:14.512 --> 01:17:14.893]  Go ahead.
[01:17:15.353 --> 01:17:17.454]  Yeah, Alex, hey, did you guys hear the news?
[01:17:17.514 --> 01:17:21.296]  They said Texas is missing a village idiot, and his name is George Bush.
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:23.340]  Well, he's not really from Texas.
[01:17:23.701 --> 01:17:24.741]  We don't claim Texas.
[01:17:24.941 --> 01:17:26.381]  I mean, we don't claim Bush from Texas.
[01:17:26.761 --> 01:17:42.926]  Yeah, he wanted to team up with a bald-headed nerd named Dick Cheney, Dr. Kevorkian, who also wanted to team up with the Gestapo, Robert Swan, Mueller III, and General Hayden to create a police state and martial law in which you have definitely made several videos about.
[01:17:43.526 --> 01:17:45.727]  Actually, they're very good videos, by the way.
[01:17:45.847 --> 01:17:48.088]  General Hayden is in the new film, Terror Storm.
[01:17:48.628 --> 01:17:49.288]  Oh, is that right?
[01:17:49.775 --> 01:17:51.175]  Yeah, I haven't seen that yet, Alex.
[01:17:51.215 --> 01:17:54.876]  I'm going to be in Austin probably in about two or three weeks, and I'd like to watch that video.
[01:17:55.196 --> 01:17:55.716]  Great.
[01:17:56.276 --> 01:18:08.259]  But, you know, the government uses all kinds of provocateurs, and, well, I don't know if she's a provocateur or not, but, you know, people like, what's her name, Ann, the one that wrote the book.
[01:18:09.239 --> 01:18:09.880]  Ann Coulter?
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:11.040]  Yeah, Ann Coulter.
[01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:14.461]  To me, she's just the same thing as an activist, I mean, or a...
[01:18:16.357 --> 01:18:27.560]  Well, she's meant to make conservatives look stupid, to overall kill the conservative message, and then just make those that stay conservative or think they're conservative think that conservatism is something completely different.
[01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:28.880]  Oh, conservatism is tyranny.
[01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:29.900]  No, it's not.
[01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:32.121]  So they're trying to sell tyranny as good.
[01:18:32.141 --> 01:18:33.081]  Thanks for the call, Jeff.
[01:18:33.481 --> 01:18:36.162]  Jason, Ian, Tim, I'm going to really try to accelerate now.
[01:18:36.642 --> 01:18:37.603]  Quickly through your calls.
[01:18:37.723 --> 01:18:38.304]  Get ready.
[01:18:38.604 --> 01:18:39.925]  We're blitzing through them already.
[01:18:39.965 --> 01:18:41.466]  We're going to increase the speed here.
[01:18:41.487 --> 01:18:45.310]  Have your comments and questions ready so more people can get involved.
[01:18:45.330 --> 01:18:45.890]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:18:46.771 --> 01:18:49.293]  You never know what issue will be brought up next.
[01:18:49.654 --> 01:18:50.995]  It's wide open phones.
[01:18:54.078 --> 01:18:56.380]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:59.663]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:10.306]  The best kept secret in the world today is that now it is possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:11.227 --> 01:19:15.009]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed, Inc.'
[01:19:14.989 --> 01:19:16.410]  's patented methodology.
[01:19:17.173 --> 01:19:27.998]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[01:19:28.639 --> 01:19:31.140]  Star War technology at its best.
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:35.022]  For more information, call 702-953-0267 or visit www.lazemedinc.com.

[01:19:53.812 --> 01:19:54.252]  Gold.
[01:19:54.592 --> 01:19:55.873]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:19:56.133 --> 01:20:02.216]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:20:02.416 --> 01:20:06.238]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:20:06.578 --> 01:20:08.479]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:20:08.519 --> 01:20:10.820]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:20:10.961 --> 01:20:17.724]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker and weaker.
[01:20:17.944 --> 01:20:19.205]  We're good to go.
[01:20:33.001 --> 01:20:33.641]  Good as gold.
[01:20:33.821 --> 01:20:39.443]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.
[01:20:39.763 --> 01:20:42.304]  As good as gold can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:20:42.324 --> 01:20:48.706]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.
[01:20:48.846 --> 01:20:49.886]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.604 --> 01:20:55.245]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:20:55.345 --> 01:20:59.467]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:20:59.587 --> 01:21:02.469]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:21:02.549 --> 01:21:09.232]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:21:09.452 --> 01:21:12.456]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:21:12.656 --> 01:21:15.059]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:21:15.199 --> 01:21:25.230]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aprazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[01:21:25.230 --> 01:21:28.011]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:21:53.081 --> 01:21:59.065]  I used to be ashamed of my toenails, so I thought I was destined to wear tennis shoes through the heat of the summer and hide my toes at the beach.
[01:21:59.425 --> 01:22:02.147]  And then my podiatrist told me about Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:22:02.307 --> 01:22:06.910]  It tackles unsightly nails by clearing out the cause of the problem, yellowing carrots and debris buildup.
[01:22:07.090 --> 01:22:11.914]  With regular use, Non-X Gel breaks down and removes the debris, so toenails look clear.
[01:22:12.094 --> 01:22:16.817]  This summer, I'm wearing open-toed sandals again, thanks to a topical natural gel called Non-X.
[01:22:17.037 --> 01:22:19.719]  If your toenails are embarrassing, I recommend Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:22:19.939 --> 01:22:22.841]  It's at your pharmacy or mass retailer in the foot care section.
[01:22:24.122 --> 01:22:24.942]  Looking for profit?
[01:22:25.202 --> 01:22:26.583]  Looking for safety and security?
[01:22:26.923 --> 01:22:29.784]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[01:22:30.184 --> 01:22:37.448]  This low-mintage collector coin with a total series mintage under $600,000 has sold at four times its current price.
[01:22:37.808 --> 01:22:41.389]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[01:22:41.569 --> 01:22:43.070]  Secure your position today.
[01:22:43.390 --> 01:22:44.591]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:44.651 --> 01:22:44.891]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:56.255 --> 01:23:02.278]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:23:02.878 --> 01:23:05.880]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:08.641 --> 01:23:10.522]  Well, I thought it was too good to be true.
[01:23:11.462 --> 01:23:14.403]  And Tim, in Korea, you are absolutely right.
[01:23:15.884 --> 01:23:17.485]  A major news website out there.
[01:23:18.496 --> 01:23:22.082]  Someone put AP on the header of a World Net Daily article.
[01:23:22.823 --> 01:23:24.545]  Prison Planet then grabbed it and posted it.
[01:23:25.106 --> 01:23:26.268]  We grabbed it and posted it.
[01:23:26.628 --> 01:23:28.511]  And that was not the Associated Press.
[01:23:29.072 --> 01:23:32.036]  You are right, and I am wrong.
[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:34.261]  I've got to check stuff like that.
[01:23:34.281 --> 01:23:39.586]  I don't know why somebody took that article, changed it a little bit, put AP on it, and then it got all over the web.
[01:23:39.686 --> 01:23:42.729]  So we went and investigated it, and when we're wrong, we'll tell you.
[01:23:43.049 --> 01:23:43.510]  There you go.
[01:23:43.990 --> 01:23:48.334]  But still the American Union, still the CFR, the CFR brags they're implementing it in their own report.
[01:23:48.774 --> 01:23:49.475]  Okay, there you go.
[01:23:50.056 --> 01:23:52.758]  So you're right, Tim and Correa, thank you for letting us know about that.
[01:23:52.838 --> 01:23:55.941]  Actually, Ryan had learned of that last week.
[01:23:55.961 --> 01:23:59.144]  He's never told me about it and changed it back to the proper heading.
[01:24:00.020 --> 01:24:03.441]  You learned that from WorldNetDaily that was gracious enough to let us know about that.
[01:24:03.561 --> 01:24:04.982]  A bunch of people put that out.
[01:24:05.602 --> 01:24:07.963]  Okay, let's go back to the calls.
[01:24:08.863 --> 01:24:11.764]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jason in Maryland.
[01:24:11.804 --> 01:24:12.724]  Jason, you're on the air.
[01:24:12.744 --> 01:24:13.645]  Hi, Alex.
[01:24:13.765 --> 01:24:14.085]  Thanks.
[01:24:14.325 --> 01:24:15.405]  I have two questions.
[01:24:16.045 --> 01:24:17.866]  First, I'd like to make a statement.
[01:24:18.746 --> 01:24:28.670]  To the lower-level minions, the people who are implementing these New World Order schemes,
[01:24:30.836 --> 01:24:34.099]  You people are going to have to stand in front of the Almighty.
[01:24:35.019 --> 01:24:38.462]  Why don't you repent that your bosses hate you too?
[01:24:39.543 --> 01:24:41.604]  They hate you just as much as they hate me.
[01:24:41.985 --> 01:24:45.267]  You're going to die too, and then you're going to stand in front of the Father.
[01:24:45.607 --> 01:24:48.209]  If you repent now, He'll accept you.
[01:24:48.730 --> 01:24:52.072]  In the name of His Son, Yahushua, He will accept you into the Kingdom.
[01:24:53.654 --> 01:24:57.216]  My questions are... I ran, uh...
[01:24:58.893 --> 01:25:04.877]  Is this two-week ultimatum just saber-rattling to acclimate our society?
[01:25:05.178 --> 01:25:05.638]  I don't know.
[01:25:05.658 --> 01:25:06.419]  I don't know.
[01:25:07.059 --> 01:25:10.401]  Last time Bush gave ultimatums to Iraq, they followed through on it.
[01:25:10.942 --> 01:25:16.185]  But it may be a way of kind of setting the precedent that, see, we did give them warnings, and they didn't listen.
[01:25:16.245 --> 01:25:22.610]  So, I mean, I think it's both at the same time, you know, to act like Iran's done something wrong, and so now they've got to be punished.
[01:25:23.890 --> 01:25:25.632]  My second question is...
[01:25:26.570 --> 01:25:28.812]  Have you heard anything more about FEMA in the churches?
[01:25:30.674 --> 01:25:32.455]  We are trying to get that pastor on.
[01:25:32.535 --> 01:25:33.936]  He's been under a lot of pressure.
[01:25:34.036 --> 01:25:36.378]  And I'm getting an echo network, and you might want to tune that out.
[01:25:37.359 --> 01:25:39.281]  Do you have a radio on, sir?
[01:25:39.381 --> 01:25:39.841]  I do not.
[01:25:41.162 --> 01:25:41.703]  See, he doesn't.
[01:25:42.163 --> 01:25:45.126]  It's an instant echo network, so that wouldn't happen if it was a radio.
[01:25:46.267 --> 01:25:46.447]  But...
[01:25:47.646 --> 01:25:52.730]  Going back to your question about the pastors and FEMA.
[01:25:53.070 --> 01:25:53.751]  That's in the news.
[01:25:53.811 --> 01:25:54.511]  It's going on.
[01:25:54.572 --> 01:25:55.352]  We got the details.
[01:25:55.372 --> 01:25:56.633]  We got the internal documents.
[01:25:57.454 --> 01:25:59.716]  And they then came to him and confronted him.
[01:25:59.776 --> 01:26:02.638]  And Pastor Bush had him on and talked to him about it.
[01:26:02.698 --> 01:26:05.180]  And now the preacher isn't going on the air anymore.
[01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:07.642]  At least we've been trying to get him on week after week.
[01:26:09.023 --> 01:26:10.684]  But we know the program is just ongoing.
[01:26:10.964 --> 01:26:13.006]  But going back to what you raised about repenting.
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:16.061]  A lot of these globalist minions don't believe in God.
[01:26:16.121 --> 01:26:21.883]  But even if they don't believe in God, they should know working for a criminal government is dangerous.
[01:26:22.584 --> 01:26:27.866]  And historically, governments, after they get full power, always target the minions that brought them to power.
[01:26:28.446 --> 01:26:29.647]  A knife along knives.
[01:26:30.567 --> 01:26:31.547]  This is what they do.
[01:26:31.907 --> 01:26:32.908]  They're called purges.
[01:26:33.564 --> 01:26:38.788]  The most dangerous place to be in a dictatorship or a tyranny is in the power structure.
[01:26:39.248 --> 01:26:41.830]  Because lower level people backstab you to get control.
[01:26:41.890 --> 01:26:42.930]  People above you do it.
[01:26:43.651 --> 01:26:46.072]  People will burn you and blame you for things they've done.
[01:26:46.793 --> 01:26:49.455]  It's a very bad place to be in a climate of fear.
[01:26:49.875 --> 01:26:50.755]  And it is happening.
[01:26:51.136 --> 01:26:53.917]  Most people that are minions of the government just like to exercise power.
[01:26:54.078 --> 01:26:55.158]  They never really thought about it.
[01:26:55.539 --> 01:26:57.240]  They've rationalized what they're doing.
[01:26:57.540 --> 01:26:58.601]  And they don't see the big picture.
[01:27:00.282 --> 01:27:01.402]  I appreciate your call.
[01:27:03.241 --> 01:27:03.962]  We've got to let you go.
[01:27:03.982 --> 01:27:04.662]  That echo's too bad.
[01:27:04.682 --> 01:27:06.083]  I don't know what's doing it.
[01:27:06.123 --> 01:27:08.484]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:27:08.885 --> 01:27:10.666]  Let's talk to Ian in Illinois.
[01:27:10.686 --> 01:27:11.466]  Ian, go ahead.
[01:27:11.486 --> 01:27:12.487]  Hi, Alex.
[01:27:12.507 --> 01:27:13.007]  How are you doing?
[01:27:13.227 --> 01:27:13.608]  Good, sir.
[01:27:13.648 --> 01:27:13.968]  Welcome.
[01:27:14.468 --> 01:27:17.130]  I've got a question about the Bohemian Grove for you.
[01:27:17.850 --> 01:27:25.295]  I've been a Grateful Dead fan for a number of years, and I've heard that a couple members of the Dead are actually members of the Bohemian Grove.
[01:27:26.624 --> 01:27:27.865]  I don't think they're members.
[01:27:28.245 --> 01:27:30.847]  They were invited guests two years ago and played at the Grove.
[01:27:30.867 --> 01:27:31.468]  Oh, really?
[01:27:31.488 --> 01:27:33.269]  That's the caliber of entertainment they have.
[01:27:33.970 --> 01:27:42.916]  Okay, because I saw some documents on the Internet, and one lady named Mary Moore actually wrote a letter to Bob Weir, one of the members of the Grateful Dead.
[01:27:43.917 --> 01:27:53.264]  And it sounded to me like they were actually members, but if they're not, I guess... They're not on the membership list we've got, but they certainly could be.
[01:27:53.825 --> 01:27:54.085]  Okay.
[01:27:54.265 --> 01:27:55.026]  Do you know why...
[01:27:55.990 --> 01:27:57.751]  Why even they would be invited to play?
[01:27:59.192 --> 01:28:02.713]  I mean, it seems kind of strange as an elite security group.
[01:28:02.753 --> 01:28:04.154]  Well, the elite are getting younger.
[01:28:05.175 --> 01:28:18.061]  I mean, you know, the guys that were listening to Bob Hope are dying, and so now most of your big CEOs and elitists are 55, 60 years old, and so they like rock and roll.
[01:28:18.961 --> 01:28:20.002]  You can call the Grateful Dead that.
[01:28:22.344 --> 01:28:24.385]  All right, well, I just had a question for you.
[01:28:24.426 --> 01:28:25.306]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:28:25.566 --> 01:28:25.987]  Thank you.
[01:28:26.047 --> 01:28:27.067]  I appreciate the call.
[01:28:28.468 --> 01:28:30.830]  All right, we're going to come right back and take more calls.
[01:28:30.850 --> 01:28:30.910]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:30.930 --> 01:28:30.990]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:31.010 --> 01:28:31.771]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:28:31.831 --> 01:28:34.472]  PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com are the websites.
[01:28:34.492 --> 01:28:35.313]  We're on the march.
[01:28:35.333 --> 01:28:36.014]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:36.034 --> 01:28:37.034]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.113 --> 01:28:58.538]  Local folklore has recognized its amazing medicinal properties for thousands of years.
[01:28:58.698 --> 01:29:04.384]  But no one knew just how to preserve the nutritional benefits and market the total fruit commercially until Zango, that is.
[01:29:04.744 --> 01:29:09.649]  Zango is made from mangosteen, a fruit that grows in the subtropical climates of Southeast Asia.
[01:29:09.909 --> 01:29:14.394]  It contains xanthomes, the highest concentration of antioxidants found in nature.
[01:29:14.694 --> 01:29:15.335]  We're good to go.
[01:29:15.355 --> 01:29:15.495]  I think?
[01:29:35.817 --> 01:29:37.438]  Unleash the power of Zango today.
[01:29:37.678 --> 01:29:38.999]  Find out more by calling 888-203-6633.
[01:29:39.019 --> 01:29:39.860]  That's 888-203-6633.
[01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:41.661]  Or visit www.mangosteenmarket.com.
[01:29:41.801 --> 01:29:43.122]  That's M-A-N-G-O-S-T-E-E-N market.com.
[01:29:54.042 --> 01:29:54.463]  We're good to go.
[01:30:14.162 --> 01:30:14.783]  We're good to go.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.923]  That's 888-803-4438 to order on the web or at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:30:53.593 --> 01:30:54.013]  We're good to go.
[01:31:08.544 --> 01:31:09.124]  We're good to go.
[01:31:27.898 --> 01:31:28.698]  We're good to go.
[01:31:28.718 --> 01:31:29.079]  We're good to go.
[01:31:54.901 --> 01:31:57.642]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:31:57.662 --> 01:32:01.563]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:02.563 --> 01:32:08.304]  Alright, I'm going to move really fast through your calls now.
[01:32:08.385 --> 01:32:08.885]  Get ready.
[01:32:09.565 --> 01:32:11.405]  And as soon as you hear somebody hang up, you can call in.
[01:32:11.445 --> 01:32:15.826]  I think the phone system takes like 20-something calls, but only five go into queue.
[01:32:16.867 --> 01:32:21.808]  And I'm told that the whole phone system itself gets busy, so that's pretty good to have 20-something calls coming in.
[01:32:22.501 --> 01:32:25.763]  At a time, and we'll just try to cycle through so we can get you on air.
[01:32:27.304 --> 01:32:36.130]  So let's move fast, kind of what Alan Combs calls in his own radio show, radio graffiti, giving each person about 45 seconds or so, which is hard to do.
[01:32:36.450 --> 01:32:37.371]  I tend to give you longer.
[01:32:37.731 --> 01:32:46.777]  It's just that's how you're able to get on air, is that we take more calls in a more high-paced, fast-paced manner so you can get on to begin with.
[01:32:47.838 --> 01:32:50.160]  Let's go ahead and talk to...
[01:32:51.474 --> 01:32:53.115]  Who is up next in this big call list?
[01:32:54.075 --> 01:32:54.956]  Jason in New York.
[01:32:54.976 --> 01:32:55.556]  You're on the air.
[01:32:55.596 --> 01:32:56.037]  Go ahead.
[01:32:56.057 --> 01:32:57.177]  Hey, Alex.
[01:32:57.197 --> 01:32:57.637]  How are you doing?
[01:32:57.898 --> 01:32:58.258]  Good, sir.
[01:32:59.018 --> 01:32:59.598]  All right.
[01:32:59.719 --> 01:33:00.639]  Just two quick things.
[01:33:00.799 --> 01:33:02.680]  One about Bilderberg.
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:15.327]  Henry Kissinger wrote a book in the late 80s called The White House Years, and he talks about Bilderberg and that book, how he needed a secret meeting place, and Bilderberg would be the perfect place.
[01:33:16.268 --> 01:33:16.968]  Who wrote this book?
[01:33:17.392 --> 01:33:18.292]  Henry Kissinger.
[01:33:18.392 --> 01:33:19.713]  It's called The White House Years.
[01:33:20.133 --> 01:33:21.413]  The White House Years.
[01:33:21.553 --> 01:33:21.893]  Wow.
[01:33:22.614 --> 01:33:29.356]  And second thing, I'd just like to read a couple sentences out of the memoirs of Richard Nixon about Bohemian Grove.
[01:33:29.516 --> 01:33:32.957]  Yeah, please don't take the Lord's name in the name, but just bleep it out.
[01:33:34.277 --> 01:33:37.338]  I said the memoirs of Richard Nixon and the Bohemian Grove.
[01:33:38.959 --> 01:33:42.200]  No, I understand, but if you're going to read that... Oh, no, no, no, no, he...
[01:33:43.118 --> 01:33:53.402]  It's just a quick thing about, he says, if I were to choose the speech that gave me the most pleasure and satisfaction in my political career, it would be my lakeside speech at the Bohemian Grove in July of 67.
[01:33:54.122 --> 01:33:57.203]  This speech is traditionally off the record and receives no publicity.
[01:33:57.803 --> 01:34:01.785]  In many important ways, it marked the first milestone on my road to the presidency.
[01:34:03.265 --> 01:34:04.146]  And that's all I had.
[01:34:04.546 --> 01:34:06.626]  Well, sure, I'm glad you called in with that, and I appreciate you.
[01:34:06.646 --> 01:34:07.447]  Stay there for a second.
[01:34:09.861 --> 01:34:10.322]  Yeah, yeah, I have.
[01:34:22.924 --> 01:34:32.132]  I mean, we can't really play it on air because it's got profanity in it, but that is Richard Nixon in the Oval Office saying that, and this is where your supposed Christian conservatives go to meet.
[01:34:32.152 --> 01:34:36.695]  Of course, they're not really Christian, nor are they conservative, just like Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh aren't.
[01:34:37.296 --> 01:34:38.197]  But it just fools people.
[01:34:38.237 --> 01:34:42.901]  But I love the fact, you know, I haven't confirmed that the White House years by Kissinger actually says that.
[01:34:42.941 --> 01:34:43.561]  I believe you.
[01:34:44.002 --> 01:34:44.422]  But take...
[01:34:45.709 --> 01:34:46.329]  We're good to go.
[01:35:16.030 --> 01:35:17.471]  He says, we're for world government.
[01:35:18.692 --> 01:35:20.192]  It's even more elaborate than what I'm saying.
[01:35:20.633 --> 01:35:29.297]  And he says, I love doing rituals at our grove in Germany, but my favorite place to do the rituals, the druidic rituals, is in Northern California at Bohemian Grove.
[01:35:29.538 --> 01:35:31.299]  I mean, folks, this is their autobiographies.
[01:35:31.319 --> 01:35:32.359]  I mean, they're writing this.
[01:35:32.659 --> 01:35:33.720]  They're saying this.
[01:35:35.441 --> 01:35:39.183]  Yeah, and the memoirs of Richard Nixon, he goes on for about a page.
[01:35:39.810 --> 01:35:41.992]  You know, talking about the Grove.
[01:35:42.012 --> 01:35:44.075]  And just one quick thing on the Kissinger.
[01:35:44.095 --> 01:35:53.565]  I just went to the library and went to the biography section, grabbed a stack of his books and just checked the index in every book for Bilderberg, Bohemian Grove, New World Order.
[01:35:53.985 --> 01:36:00.713]  And in the Kissinger years, right in the index, you'll find Bilderberg Conference right in the index of the White House years.
[01:36:04.264 --> 01:36:05.064]  Thank you so much.
[01:36:05.104 --> 01:36:06.205]  I appreciate you joining us.
[01:36:06.265 --> 01:36:09.686]  See, I said I'd give each caller about a minute or so, but you just can't do it.
[01:36:09.706 --> 01:36:10.546]  The calls are too good.
[01:36:11.707 --> 01:36:22.211]  And it makes me think of a big national Christian radio show, I'm not going to give it attention, who a few years ago made it their mission to destroy me.
[01:36:22.231 --> 01:36:23.611]  Of course, it just sent me more listeners.
[01:36:23.631 --> 01:36:24.552]  They're so stupid.
[01:36:26.392 --> 01:36:31.054]  And a syndicated show that's on at the same time I'm on would get on the air
[01:36:33.050 --> 01:36:34.251]  And I'm sorry if I'm smacking.
[01:36:34.752 --> 01:36:38.315]  While callers are talking, I'm cramming a sub-sandwich in my face trying to eat.
[01:36:38.335 --> 01:36:39.416]  I haven't eaten yet.
[01:36:40.637 --> 01:36:41.858]  But going back, I digress.
[01:36:42.719 --> 01:36:49.245]  People would send me audio clips of the show, and the show would say stuff like, We've challenged Alex Jones to come on, but he's afraid.
[01:36:49.805 --> 01:36:51.447]  And I'd call him and say, I'll be glad to come on.
[01:36:51.467 --> 01:36:53.248]  And then they'd, okay, we'll talk to you later.
[01:36:53.268 --> 01:36:54.489]  And then, oh, he won't come on.
[01:36:55.050 --> 01:36:56.111]  Very dishonest.
[01:36:56.696 --> 01:37:02.298]  They'd get on the air and go, we need to pray for Alex lying about George Bush and some place called Bohemian Grove.
[01:37:02.338 --> 01:37:03.419]  That doesn't exist.
[01:37:03.479 --> 01:37:05.800]  And skull and bones is just a fraternity thing.
[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:07.341]  And it's no big deal.
[01:37:07.401 --> 01:37:09.882]  And Alex makes up W1999.
[01:37:09.942 --> 01:37:11.723]  Bush never signed any such thing.
[01:37:11.763 --> 01:37:13.203]  Where's that document, Alex?
[01:37:16.385 --> 01:37:18.265]  Alex says that a missile was shot at the U.S.
[01:37:18.345 --> 01:37:18.766]  at Nucas.
[01:37:18.786 --> 01:37:20.026]  Where's that missile, Alex?
[01:37:20.066 --> 01:37:20.926]  Just all made up.
[01:37:21.067 --> 01:37:21.587]  All made up.
[01:37:23.448 --> 01:37:24.188]  Just all lies.
[01:37:25.609 --> 01:37:29.911]  Well, you know, it's very unbiblical, and you can go to hell for bearing false witness.
[01:37:30.311 --> 01:37:34.173]  I tell you, Alex Jones is working for the dark side.
[01:37:34.193 --> 01:37:40.456]  Oh, yeah, I've just got the memoirs of chancellors and presidents admitting all this.
[01:37:41.334 --> 01:37:41.814]  You're a bunch of trash.
[01:38:11.405 --> 01:38:12.625]  And you may fool some people.
[01:38:13.346 --> 01:38:25.730]  But I tell you, taking people into bondage, taking the lesser ones, taking those that aren't intelligent enough to know the truth, and manipulating them and lying them and leading them into traps, that is the ultimate sin.
[01:38:26.370 --> 01:38:31.032]  And it's better for you to tie a big fat millstone around your neck and throw it in the deepest sea.
[01:38:31.252 --> 01:38:32.132]  Let me tell you something.
[01:38:32.152 --> 01:38:34.093]  The beginning of wisdom is the fear of God.
[01:38:34.413 --> 01:38:35.973]  Well, the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.
[01:38:36.254 --> 01:38:37.394]  The actual Bible verse.
[01:38:38.570 --> 01:38:43.172]  So I think, as Tex Marsh says, the beginning of ignorance is fear of the devil.
[01:38:43.192 --> 01:38:45.733]  I am not afraid of he who can kill my body.
[01:38:45.793 --> 01:38:46.153]  I'm not.
[01:38:46.594 --> 01:38:46.934]  I'm not.
[01:38:47.834 --> 01:38:49.255]  And it's not even that I'm afraid of God.
[01:38:49.275 --> 01:38:49.995]  I am afraid of God.
[01:38:50.355 --> 01:38:52.436]  I mean, it's like fearing a cliff.
[01:38:52.476 --> 01:38:56.378]  It's like fearing a... I don't know how to say it.
[01:38:56.398 --> 01:38:58.119]  The point is, it's just a law of nature.
[01:38:58.859 --> 01:38:59.779]  It's instinctive.
[01:38:59.799 --> 01:39:01.000]  I mean, I respect God.
[01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:04.661]  But I don't do what I do because I fear God.
[01:39:05.542 --> 01:39:08.003]  I'm just driven and possessed and controlled...
[01:39:09.611 --> 01:39:11.874]  By the wish to expose evil and fight it.
[01:39:12.014 --> 01:39:13.296]  I've turned myself over.
[01:39:13.316 --> 01:39:16.140]  And I'm certainly not perfect.
[01:39:16.180 --> 01:39:17.061]  I'm here to tell you right now.
[01:39:17.442 --> 01:39:23.209]  But I have attempted to, and I can feel the Spirit stronger and stronger every day, to turn myself over to God's will.
[01:39:23.490 --> 01:39:24.371]  To be a vessel.
[01:39:25.504 --> 01:39:26.324]  And let me tell you something.
[01:39:26.344 --> 01:39:28.125]  I can tune into these phony Christian talk shows.
[01:39:28.145 --> 01:39:29.085]  They're not really Christian.
[01:39:29.645 --> 01:39:31.325]  And it is the devil, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:31.405 --> 01:39:32.066]  I can hear it.
[01:39:32.406 --> 01:39:36.327]  I mean, you want to find the devil, you'll find the devil on Christian Talk Radio.
[01:39:36.667 --> 01:39:46.309]  It's just real quiet, manipulative, namby-pamby, emotional, just hodgepodge, none of the real issues.
[01:39:47.089 --> 01:39:49.610]  Oh boy, I can literally see it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:50.530 --> 01:39:52.171]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:39:52.531 --> 01:39:53.751]  See, we're not moving fast here.
[01:39:54.607 --> 01:39:56.089]  But it was a good call from New York.
[01:39:57.352 --> 01:40:02.121]  Let's talk to... Is David next?
[01:40:04.145 --> 01:40:05.568]  David in Arizona, you're on the air.
[01:40:05.608 --> 01:40:05.929]  Go ahead.
[01:40:06.437 --> 01:40:07.118]  Good day, Alex.
[01:40:07.158 --> 01:40:07.638]  How are you?
[01:40:07.818 --> 01:40:08.198]  Good, sir.
[01:40:08.518 --> 01:40:09.699]  Such a pleasure to talk to you.
[01:40:09.759 --> 01:40:11.860]  I'm one of your most ardent supporters.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.662]  I carry InfoWars business cards with me.
[01:40:15.342 --> 01:40:17.724]  From freedom to slavery, call InfoWars.
[01:40:18.464 --> 01:40:19.485]  You like the sound of that.
[01:40:19.745 --> 01:40:20.205]  I love it.
[01:40:20.225 --> 01:40:20.585]  Thank you.
[01:40:21.125 --> 01:40:21.786]  You're welcome.
[01:40:22.046 --> 01:40:25.148]  There are so many questions I have for you, Alex, but I know we don't have time.
[01:40:25.208 --> 01:40:30.611]  I have one pressing issue that I'd like to ask you about, and I know you don't talk about this much for certain reasons.
[01:40:31.357 --> 01:40:42.323]  I'm a former member of one of the most well-known constitutional citizen militias, and we haven't heard much about them since the government began to demonize them after the massacre at Waco and Ruby Ridge.
[01:40:43.043 --> 01:40:48.166]  I do know from my past experience that there's a tremendous amount of dissension in the military.
[01:40:48.826 --> 01:40:55.190]  I happen to know many officers who are not going along with the New World Disorder.
[01:40:56.008 --> 01:40:59.271]  And I would like for you to comment on what you know.
[01:40:59.571 --> 01:41:01.373]  I know you have a lot of reliable sources.
[01:41:02.193 --> 01:41:08.839]  What you know about the most current activities of many of the lawful constitutional militias.
[01:41:10.780 --> 01:41:12.682]  Well, that's a huge and important question.
[01:41:12.702 --> 01:41:15.144]  And give me one more of your questions.
[01:41:15.184 --> 01:41:16.205]  I'll try to answer that one too.
[01:41:17.325 --> 01:41:22.226]  Well, one of the things that really concerns me is UN takeover of the Internet.
[01:41:23.247 --> 01:41:27.348]  I noticed an article not too long ago in the World Net Daily.
[01:41:28.468 --> 01:41:35.270]  Kofi Annan was involved in trying to get involved in taking over the Internet.
[01:41:35.370 --> 01:41:39.031]  Oh, yeah, that's BBC, that's Computer Weekly, that's everywhere.
[01:41:39.051 --> 01:41:41.412]  Let me comment on those two really important questions.
[01:41:41.472 --> 01:41:43.593]  Man, I love the questions that listeners bring up.
[01:41:43.673 --> 01:41:44.493]  Okay, here's the deal.
[01:41:46.061 --> 01:41:50.526]  We're all in the militia, all men, and I believe women too, to a certain extent.
[01:41:50.946 --> 01:41:52.508]  The women aren't forced to be part of it.
[01:41:53.529 --> 01:41:55.531]  There were certainly women who were involved in the Revolutionary War.
[01:41:57.052 --> 01:41:58.314]  And I believe in the militia.
[01:41:58.354 --> 01:42:08.184]  The problem is, if I'm a guerrilla fighter, if I'm fighting the New World Order and the Information War, I don't go to where the enemy is waiting for me and has set traps.
[01:42:09.125 --> 01:42:12.887]  And so I decide where to strike and when and how.
[01:42:13.708 --> 01:42:16.530]  I fight the enemy on my terms at least when I can.
[01:42:16.570 --> 01:42:21.673]  When I'm cornered or have to do it on their terms, I will if I can't retreat or get around them.
[01:42:22.253 --> 01:42:24.394]  So I always try to, number one, do it on my terms.
[01:42:24.434 --> 01:42:25.375]  That's just the art of war.
[01:42:26.801 --> 01:42:39.447]  And so if they've targeted and put the main force of their agents into targeting the militia starting in the early 1990s, what really set the BATF off was when militia members, what was it in Alabama?
[01:42:39.808 --> 01:42:40.808]  No, it was North Carolina.
[01:42:40.888 --> 01:42:41.308]  I forget.
[01:42:41.328 --> 01:42:42.729]  The Good Old Boy Roundup.
[01:42:42.749 --> 01:42:43.890]  I've got video of it somewhere.
[01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:52.474]  Remember when the Apogees of Blacks hung up and they were selling the N-word hunting licenses and there was FBI, BATF, they were all there, thousands of them.
[01:42:53.257 --> 01:43:00.042]  I know it was over a thousand, and the militia got that video of them, and they really went after them after that.
[01:43:00.722 --> 01:43:06.847]  They're really afraid of former military people, current military people, saying we're going to be guardians of the people.
[01:43:07.187 --> 01:43:11.430]  They're afraid of that image, too, of the people being involved.
[01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:13.562]  And the spread of court.
[01:43:14.082 --> 01:43:17.585]  And so very early on, they put the provocateurs in, they put their agents in.
[01:43:17.605 --> 01:43:23.671]  I mean, some militia meetings, I've discovered, had more feds in it than they had militia members.
[01:43:25.893 --> 01:43:34.440]  And it was a great place for them to provocateur people into just saying they'd carry out some violence and then bust them, or then make it up that they were planning it and bust them.
[01:43:35.401 --> 01:43:36.142]  So I've seen this.
[01:43:36.904 --> 01:43:42.108]  Over and over and over again, centering in Michigan and other states around the country.
[01:43:43.068 --> 01:43:59.959]  And then also, if you're an urban warrior and you're an information warrior, whatever ilk you see yourself in, obviously the info warrior is more effective in this phase, then why do you wear camo on the streets of America?
[01:44:00.579 --> 01:44:04.742]  Camouflage is a pinstripe suit and a briefcase.
[01:44:05.763 --> 01:44:06.043]  Okay?
[01:44:08.078 --> 01:44:24.976]  And so also, I went and investigated it, looked at it, went to some meetings, went to some events, and it was also just a lot of loons, a lot of people that wanted to play Rambo, and wanted to run around and play Secret Agent.
[01:44:26.237 --> 01:44:27.398]  I'm out on the field, folks.
[01:44:27.458 --> 01:44:28.199]  I'm out in the open.
[01:44:29.248 --> 01:44:38.953]  And see, that's where I choose to fight them, not in the dark, not in a cave, figuratively, not in some murky bush where the enemy likes to operate.
[01:44:39.034 --> 01:44:45.517]  I'm right out in the open, right in the spotlight of high visibility, and if they want to do something to me, they'll have to do it in full view.
[01:44:46.338 --> 01:44:46.718]  Okay?
[01:44:48.039 --> 01:44:56.003]  And so I believe in the militia, I support the militia, I just, it's so riddled with government agents and operatives and
[01:44:57.807 --> 01:44:58.608]  We're good to go.
[01:44:58.668 --> 01:44:59.328]  We're good to go.
[01:45:22.832 --> 01:45:24.453]  And it's all about being serious.
[01:45:24.493 --> 01:45:26.154]  It's about having escape routes out of your city.
[01:45:26.194 --> 01:45:28.136]  It's about having caches of weapons and food.
[01:45:28.476 --> 01:45:32.358]  It's about having your women informed and ready and educated.
[01:45:32.598 --> 01:45:34.459]  It's about being friends with your neighbors.
[01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:42.324]  And then you need to mainly focus on neighborhood barbecues where then you just distribute pro-gun literature.
[01:45:42.344 --> 01:45:43.165]  You know, you do it
[01:45:44.346 --> 01:45:44.666]  I think?
[01:46:05.587 --> 01:46:09.130]  Core, enforced multiplication with leaderless resistance.
[01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:14.493]  You go out and find other leaders and activate them to create their own InfoWars squads.
[01:46:14.973 --> 01:46:18.436]  I think you've noticed, I know the government's listening, they know full well what I've done.
[01:46:19.016 --> 01:46:23.019]  What I've preached from the beginning has been information warfare against them.
[01:46:23.039 --> 01:46:26.641]  And that's what we've done, and we're smashing them!
[01:46:27.362 --> 01:46:29.023]  We're crushing them on every level!
[01:46:29.243 --> 01:46:33.586]  The people wouldn't listen to this ten years ago, now they beg you to tell them.
[01:46:36.192 --> 01:46:36.392]  I think?
[01:47:03.126 --> 01:47:05.508]  That's basically my answer on the militia.
[01:47:05.808 --> 01:47:19.780]  I don't talk about it a lot because I don't want to steer people into the groups running around and camouflage many of them wonderful, well-meaning people who aren't sophisticated enough to know that you don't run around and camouflage.
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:24.664]  You run around and camouflage green camo because we had wars in Southeast Asia.
[01:47:25.515 --> 01:47:27.656]  And there was a lot of camouflage at the Army-Navy stores.
[01:47:28.176 --> 01:47:29.736]  I'm wearing camouflage right now.
[01:47:30.177 --> 01:47:36.679]  I'm wearing a Navy blue button-up shirt, and I'm wearing Levi's blue jeans, and I'm wearing black shoes.
[01:47:38.419 --> 01:47:39.499]  And I got a short haircut.
[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:41.440]  Okay?
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:44.141]  Now I am in uniform right now.
[01:47:45.121 --> 01:47:45.481]  Right now.
[01:47:45.561 --> 01:47:50.523]  I blend in, and that's my job, and I'm sticking to it.
[01:47:55.157 --> 01:47:55.897]  So it's really simple.
[01:47:55.917 --> 01:48:01.681]  You know, the enemy, they're masters at telling us what our uniform is, and then we're supposed to go out and wear it.
[01:48:01.701 --> 01:48:11.906]  You know, MTV and the rest of them tell kids that the uniform is your pants hanging down around your ankles and strutting around, walking around like a gorilla and having, you know, all these things all over your body.
[01:48:12.266 --> 01:48:16.769]  And then they tell the cops that's the uniform of a gang, but really kids just think it's what cool kids wear.
[01:48:17.289 --> 01:48:18.950]  And then the police alert on your children.
[01:48:19.631 --> 01:48:29.896]  You want your children to wear button-up polo shirts and slacks and nice shoes and belts and have a short haircut so the enemy doesn't notice them, so they get respect immediately.
[01:48:30.156 --> 01:48:32.077]  You teach your children it's about survival.
[01:48:32.258 --> 01:48:38.701]  The government's evil and wants to hurt you and wants to put you in a prison and put vaccines in you and test biological weapons on you.
[01:48:38.721 --> 01:48:40.602]  They do it right here at Huntsville in Texas.
[01:48:41.937 --> 01:48:49.085]  And so you tell your children the government wants to get them and you explain to them history, then your children are going to do what you say and they're going to be on your side.
[01:48:49.105 --> 01:48:50.426]  That's what the family's about.
[01:48:50.446 --> 01:48:51.527]  It's circling the wagons.
[01:48:51.748 --> 01:48:57.494]  The family's the unit against the government, against the corrupt state, against the tribe over the hill.
[01:49:02.256 --> 01:49:04.257]  You don't tell your kids, you're not old enough to drink.
[01:49:04.277 --> 01:49:06.357]  You're not old enough to smoke.
[01:49:06.677 --> 01:49:08.018]  You're not old enough to dress like that.
[01:49:08.038 --> 01:49:11.499]  You tell them, hey, that's what the media tells you to dress like.
[01:49:11.559 --> 01:49:12.279]  That's not cool.
[01:49:12.319 --> 01:49:13.079]  That's a scam.
[01:49:13.679 --> 01:49:15.680]  You explain it to them that way, they'll listen to you.
[01:49:17.420 --> 01:49:24.162]  Throughout history, I've studied a lot of different civilizations, a lot of times in bad, oppressed situations, children don't rebel against their parents.
[01:49:24.722 --> 01:49:26.903]  Or in tough times, children don't rebel.
[01:49:27.463 --> 01:49:30.144]  Your children, you give them responsibilities when they're little.
[01:49:30.675 --> 01:49:32.057]  You give them respect when they're little.
[01:49:32.758 --> 01:49:33.799]  And they'll respect you.
[01:49:34.219 --> 01:49:35.781]  Not that I claim to be the best parent in the world.
[01:49:35.801 --> 01:49:38.084]  I just know the systems at work from study.
[01:49:40.607 --> 01:49:43.070]  So we build communities against the New World Order.
[01:49:44.031 --> 01:49:45.573]  We build it at the neighborhood level.
[01:49:46.494 --> 01:49:48.476]  We fight them with micro-FM, whatever.
[01:49:49.137 --> 01:49:50.098]  We defeat the globalists.
[01:49:50.118 --> 01:49:50.659]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:53.900 --> 01:50:00.723]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:01.043 --> 01:50:02.423]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.603 --> 01:50:04.804]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:04.964 --> 01:50:07.045]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:07.325 --> 01:50:12.267]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:12.587 --> 01:50:16.629]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:16.869 --> 01:50:18.650]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:18.730 --> 01:50:29.375]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.515 --> 01:50:31.436]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[01:52:09.841 --> 01:52:10.481]  We're good to go.
[01:52:39.358 --> 01:52:42.442]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:42.603 --> 01:52:48.471]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:53:08.621 --> 01:53:09.301]  Welcome back.
[01:53:09.341 --> 01:53:11.302]  Let's go to Mark in Texas.
[01:53:11.342 --> 01:53:12.282]  First time caller.
[01:53:12.302 --> 01:53:12.982]  Welcome, Mark.
[01:53:13.822 --> 01:53:14.443]  How's it going, Alex?
[01:53:14.823 --> 01:53:15.203]  Good, sir.
[01:53:16.163 --> 01:53:17.744]  I just wanted to make one quick comment.
[01:53:17.784 --> 01:53:24.245]  I know you probably wouldn't like this, but I would just like to thank you for supporting the movement for so long and keeping with it.
[01:53:25.146 --> 01:53:27.406]  And also, I have two questions real quick.
[01:53:28.047 --> 01:53:33.948]  What do you know about the government already imposing sanctions in the free global state of NSK?
[01:53:34.968 --> 01:53:35.889]  And also...
[01:53:37.256 --> 01:53:48.663]  What do you know about the government putting cameras on the median, like, say, for example, where you enter 183 by North Lamar, just to record license plates?
[01:53:49.204 --> 01:53:55.948]  Yeah, let's go back to the first question, because, just to show my ignorance, what is the global free state of NSK?
[01:53:56.809 --> 01:54:03.313]  Well, in Slovenia, NSK is like, it's basically its own, I guess, country.
[01:54:04.011 --> 01:54:12.957]  But it's free to anybody and any individual, no matter what their background is, can join as a citizen.
[01:54:12.977 --> 01:54:14.338]  I wasn't aware of that.
[01:54:14.378 --> 01:54:15.578]  Well, fill me in.
[01:54:15.659 --> 01:54:17.300]  So you learn something new every day.
[01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:17.960]  What's going on?
[01:54:18.761 --> 01:54:30.968]  Well, I've been hearing lately, I'm really not at liberty to disclose from who, that the government now is trying to basically close that down or not allow Slovenia to...
[01:54:32.358 --> 01:54:32.979]  We're good to go.
[01:54:32.999 --> 01:54:33.279]  I think?
[01:54:53.370 --> 01:54:53.470]  Alex?
[01:54:53.490 --> 01:54:53.630]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:22.205 --> 01:55:23.706]  Yeah, you said Alex, and then you quit talking.
[01:55:23.726 --> 01:55:25.087]  I think is... Hello?
[01:55:26.047 --> 01:55:26.908]  Yeah, go ahead, caller.
[01:55:27.808 --> 01:55:39.555]  I'd like to make a comment about the Constitution as an item that I think has been completely overlooked, possibly intentionally, by the Congress and the President.
[01:55:40.716 --> 01:55:47.480]  I strongly believe that any agreement between two sovereign countries is, by definition, a treaty.
[01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:49.221]  So that means that...
[01:55:50.057 --> 01:56:02.540]  All of these free trade agreements and some of these other things that have been going on, they're in violation of the Constitution because the Senate is supposed to ratify treaties with a two-thirds majority.
[01:56:02.580 --> 01:56:04.260]  That's 67 out of 100 folks.
[01:56:04.280 --> 01:56:04.680]  You're right.
[01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:10.862]  Number one, if a treaty is a violation of the Constitution or a Bill of Rights, the Bill of Rights is the Trump on the Constitution, it's null and void.
[01:56:11.222 --> 01:56:13.863]  Then if they don't have a two-thirds ratification, it's null and void.
[01:56:14.283 --> 01:56:19.344]  But Bush is signing through executive orders basic treaties, what he claims as treaty power,
[01:56:19.844 --> 01:56:22.346]  Well, I've been wanting to make this point for so long.
[01:56:22.426 --> 01:56:27.790]  I tried to call in a couple of times and couldn't get in, but because your lines were so busy, but I think we should be barraging our members of the Senate,
[01:56:46.750 --> 01:56:50.913]  And asking them why they're not following the Constitution regarding treaties.
[01:56:51.033 --> 01:56:51.694]  Well, you're right.
[01:56:51.794 --> 01:56:53.535]  But, I mean, go back two years ago.
[01:56:53.555 --> 01:57:04.483]  I remember when three different Supreme Court justices, one a Republican, two Democrats, were writing articles for major publications like USA Today saying they take orders from the UN Court.
[01:57:05.464 --> 01:57:06.244]  And the EU.
[01:57:06.624 --> 01:57:06.965]  I know.
[01:57:07.045 --> 01:57:09.807]  So they're saying, oh, that's now above us.
[01:57:09.827 --> 01:57:12.889]  They say they should all be impeached immediately.
[01:57:13.616 --> 01:57:15.698]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg and all that trash.
[01:57:16.018 --> 01:57:16.618]  Oh, I agree.
[01:57:17.018 --> 01:57:17.419]  I agree.
[01:57:18.459 --> 01:57:23.403]  I'd like to make one comment about the caller who called in about Richard Nixon.
[01:57:23.723 --> 01:57:24.043]  Yes.
[01:57:25.204 --> 01:57:31.388]  Richard Nixon, in 1967, wrote an article in the Council on Foreign Affairs.
[01:57:31.448 --> 01:57:31.929]  Stay there.
[01:57:32.129 --> 01:57:32.549]  Stay there.
[01:57:33.730 --> 01:57:38.393]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:44.301 --> 01:57:46.284]  Big Brother.
[01:57:46.405 --> 01:57:47.306]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:47.346 --> 01:57:48.969]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:49.009 --> 01:57:49.991]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.602 --> 01:57:57.463]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.483 --> 01:58:01.746]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.346 --> 01:58:06.449]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:15.816 --> 01:58:17.878]  Already into hour number three.
[01:58:17.958 --> 01:58:24.883]  Larry Pratt will be joining us just for a couple of segments because I want to get some updates on what's happening with the Second Amendment that is under siege.
[01:58:25.572 --> 01:58:27.973]  One of the main focuses we cover here is liberals.
[01:58:28.994 --> 01:58:29.414]  That's right.
[01:58:29.834 --> 01:58:30.915]  You're against open borders.
[01:58:30.955 --> 01:58:31.975]  You're pro-Second Amendment.
[01:58:31.995 --> 01:58:32.856]  You're pro-America.
[01:58:32.896 --> 01:58:34.136]  You're anti-UN.
[01:58:34.777 --> 01:58:36.057]  You are a liberal.
[01:58:36.878 --> 01:58:39.919]  You support Bush and the doubling of the size of government and everything.
[01:58:39.939 --> 01:58:40.780]  You're a good conservative.
[01:58:42.421 --> 01:58:45.242]  And arresting reporters for free speech and everything else.
[01:58:45.682 --> 01:58:46.743]  And torturing children.
[01:58:46.783 --> 01:58:48.004]  That's now the new conservatism.
[01:58:48.244 --> 01:58:49.204]  So I'm not conservative.
[01:58:49.344 --> 01:58:51.045]  I am a liberal, if you want to use those false terms.
[01:58:51.065 --> 01:58:54.407]  So we'll be talking to fellow ultra-liberal
[01:58:55.294 --> 01:58:56.395]  Ultra commie.
[01:58:56.615 --> 01:58:57.715]  I'm being sarcastic, folks.
[01:58:58.055 --> 01:58:58.876]  Larry Pratt coming up.
[01:58:59.636 --> 01:59:02.737]  Going back to, I think it was John in New York.
[01:59:03.258 --> 01:59:09.900]  John, finish up the statement, the thing that Nixon wrote, you said, in some foreign affairs CFR article in 69.
[01:59:09.940 --> 01:59:10.100]  Go ahead.
[01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:10.721]  It was in 67.
[01:59:10.821 --> 01:59:11.921]  In 67, he said that he would open up the...
[01:59:19.025 --> 01:59:21.868]  I really appreciate you taking my call, Alex.
[01:59:41.798 --> 01:59:43.138]  And I'm grateful for everything you do.
[01:59:43.198 --> 01:59:43.558]  Thank you.
[01:59:43.958 --> 01:59:46.159]  No, I'm grateful to you guys and gals out there.
[01:59:46.179 --> 01:59:47.039]  Thank you, John.
[01:59:47.519 --> 01:59:48.879]  Joe in Wisconsin.
[01:59:48.899 --> 01:59:50.040]  Hello, Joe.
[01:59:50.060 --> 01:59:51.320]  Hello.
[01:59:51.460 --> 01:59:53.100]  Hey, I got that website for you.
[01:59:53.520 --> 02:00:01.182]  I launched it right after you said that the average person can't find Iraqi on a map, but they're most willing to nuke them.
[02:00:01.622 --> 02:00:03.382]  And I thought, that is really sickening.
[02:00:03.582 --> 02:00:08.043]  So what I wanted to do was start a homeschool-friendly website
[02:00:08.672 --> 02:00:11.035]  That people could go find resources and whatever.
[02:00:11.476 --> 02:00:13.218]  I can give you the URL.
[02:00:13.378 --> 02:00:13.599]  Sure.
[02:00:13.639 --> 02:00:14.800]  Resources on what?
[02:00:16.022 --> 02:00:16.703]  Just anything.
[02:00:17.324 --> 02:00:26.416]  There's just general, handy, good-to-know links that I've got a world map, atlases as the first two links.
[02:00:27.297 --> 02:00:28.738]  There's NASA's website.
[02:00:28.918 --> 02:00:33.061]  Well, I think it's great that you've done that, but at the same time, it's not like that data wasn't available.
[02:00:33.501 --> 02:00:40.786]  People don't know about it because they've chosen to just watch television and drool, and the TV programmers have made it as mindless as possible.
[02:00:41.206 --> 02:00:46.790]  So, I mean, I commend you for putting information out, but I think what we're at loss for is anti-New World Order information.
[02:00:46.810 --> 02:00:47.691]  We need more of that.
[02:00:48.451 --> 02:00:54.635]  I mean, I think it's fine to have a thing with a bunch of maps on it, but I don't know if that will suddenly make people go find out where Iraq is.
[02:00:54.675 --> 02:00:55.676]  But go ahead and tell us about it.
[02:00:56.289 --> 02:00:58.191]  Okay, well, there's different sections.
[02:00:58.811 --> 02:01:04.596]  There's a blue chunk that's news and resources, and of course InfoWars is on top of that.
[02:01:06.157 --> 02:01:09.640]  I don't know why, there's better sites, but go ahead.
[02:01:10.601 --> 02:01:20.910]  Anyway, there's a red section that has YouTube exclusive media, and that's got all the different, well, that would be,
[02:01:22.131 --> 02:01:35.336]  Like Colin Powell, nothing like Lacey Peterson or junk like that, but political interest stories, there's an entire chunk of Lou Dobbs on there.
[02:01:35.436 --> 02:01:45.761]  I still haven't categorized any of that, but I just tried to find useful, informative links that I thought were as... Now that sounds exciting.
[02:01:45.801 --> 02:01:46.561]  What's the website?
[02:01:47.441 --> 02:01:49.302]  It's www.cooltoad.com
[02:02:00.585 --> 02:02:02.847]  You know, I'm not criticizing you, but let me give you a tip.
[02:02:03.047 --> 02:02:08.612]  I never understand why people build these great websites and then give it a 14-foot long URL.
[02:02:08.632 --> 02:02:12.616]  I mean, it's really better to have a short, simple name.
[02:02:13.499 --> 02:02:14.640]  Well, it's going to crash.
[02:02:14.680 --> 02:02:15.861]  I pretty much know that.
[02:02:16.141 --> 02:02:19.563]  And I encourage everybody to make a copy of it.
[02:02:19.724 --> 02:02:23.166]  Save that as a web page, because I know it's going to come crashing down.
[02:02:23.206 --> 02:02:27.489]  I'm staring at it right now saying, four hours worth, and it'll be paying to death.
[02:02:29.231 --> 02:02:30.011]  And I'm also...
[02:02:31.843 --> 02:02:35.766]  Getting authors, soliciting any articles, news, whatever.
[02:02:36.226 --> 02:02:36.606]  Okay.
[02:02:37.166 --> 02:02:37.647]  Good, man.
[02:02:37.667 --> 02:02:38.287]  Appreciate it.
[02:02:38.507 --> 02:02:39.008]  Good job.
[02:02:39.528 --> 02:02:40.088]  Take care.
[02:02:40.108 --> 02:02:40.969]  All right.
[02:02:41.029 --> 02:02:44.211]  We'll come back and talk to Larry Pratt and take a bunch of other calls and cover this.
[02:02:46.716 --> 02:02:54.081]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:02:54.361 --> 02:02:59.104]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:02:59.324 --> 02:03:04.968]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:03:05.208 --> 02:03:09.731]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:03:09.951 --> 02:03:17.116]  The casual society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:03:17.136 --> 02:03:21.659]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.839 --> 02:03:24.340]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:03:24.581 --> 02:03:31.285]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:03:31.525 --> 02:03:36.787]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:03:36.807 --> 02:03:37.207]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:03:47.446 --> 02:03:48.487]  The war on terrorism.
[02:03:48.807 --> 02:03:51.589]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:51.850 --> 02:03:56.013]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:56.453 --> 02:03:57.274]  So what do you do?
[02:03:57.594 --> 02:04:02.158]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:02.645 --> 02:04:03.226]  We're good to go.
[02:04:27.406 --> 02:04:31.808]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[02:04:32.248 --> 02:04:36.290]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:36.590 --> 02:04:39.311]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:39.611 --> 02:04:43.553]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:04:45.693 --> 02:04:51.656]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:04:59.633 --> 02:04:59.953]  I think.
[02:05:17.363 --> 02:05:19.524]  or subscribe online at our website www.anu.org
[02:05:46.934 --> 02:05:52.960]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.580 --> 02:05:56.563]  It's Alex Jones, and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:59.767 --> 02:06:15.355]  We must never forget that the first thing the federal government along with the state and local government did when Americans were down and out was jam communications, cut police lines, not let the thousands of police and firefighters that flooded into New Orleans come in and help the people.
[02:06:15.395 --> 02:06:21.238]  The emergency manager for four days followed orders to let his mother drown to death in a nursing home and die.
[02:06:21.839 --> 02:06:24.020]  That's the mind control they've got over these police.
[02:06:24.700 --> 02:06:31.423]  And they sent in the National Guard, the military, led by the FBI, into the high and dry, even wealthy areas.
[02:06:31.463 --> 02:06:34.184]  My point is, when the wealthy aren't even safe, we're really in trouble.
[02:06:34.704 --> 02:06:42.687]  And they admit on ABC News and CBS and NBC that they went in and confiscated their guns because the citizens can't have guns.
[02:06:44.389 --> 02:06:57.275]  And Bush, according to Larry Pratt, and of course Bob Barr on this show, NRA board member, told us a few months ago, we have the headline up on PrisonPlanet.com, that Bush is more anti-gun than Clinton in his actual actions, using regulatory agencies to do it.
[02:06:57.615 --> 02:07:02.597]  The BATF has been rating innocent people at record levels with massive increases in funding.
[02:07:02.958 --> 02:07:04.458]  A reign of terror is upon us.
[02:07:04.838 --> 02:07:10.281]  Meanwhile, Bush gave a speech during the election year of 2004 that he was pro-Second Amendment,
[02:07:10.911 --> 02:07:13.693]  He said, to keep and bear arms within the law.
[02:07:13.713 --> 02:07:18.095]  They claim the laws they pass can supersede the Bill of Rights, which they cannot.
[02:07:19.176 --> 02:07:20.657]  So this is all going on.
[02:07:20.697 --> 02:07:32.504]  So to give us an update on the troops being put back into New Orleans with shoot-to-kill orders, if anybody resists, and on what's happening with the Second Amendment all over the United States right now, and any good news as well,
[02:07:33.866 --> 02:07:37.270]  Here's Larry Pratt of Governors of America for the next two segments.
[02:07:37.290 --> 02:07:40.353]  We'll go back to your calls and news for those of you that are patiently holding.
[02:07:40.653 --> 02:07:42.115]  Larry Pratt, thanks for joining us, sir.
[02:07:42.375 --> 02:07:43.997]  Well, Alex, thanks for having me with you.
[02:07:44.017 --> 02:07:44.698]  I always enjoy it.
[02:07:45.336 --> 02:07:48.158]  Always great to have you on, even though it's painful to talk about this issue.
[02:07:48.178 --> 02:07:50.819]  If we don't defend the Second Amendment, it's going to evaporate.
[02:07:51.900 --> 02:07:53.761]  Can you recap what happened in New Orleans?
[02:07:53.821 --> 02:07:56.483]  Because some people are still in denial that I know.
[02:07:56.583 --> 02:07:59.464]  And then where that case is right now.
[02:07:59.905 --> 02:08:04.267]  And then give us your take on the troops being back there on the ground now.
[02:08:04.287 --> 02:08:06.889]  And then give us kind of a rundown on the other things we faced.
[02:08:08.110 --> 02:08:11.612]  The situation occurred exactly as you described it.
[02:08:11.712 --> 02:08:13.573]  And if there really are people that...
[02:08:14.412 --> 02:08:33.589]  That haven't had a chance to see it or even heard about it, gunowners.org is our website, and it's got a section called New Orleans Gun Confiscation, and in the little basket of items that are there, there's a couple of TV news videos that we've put there, and you can watch it happen.
[02:08:33.949 --> 02:08:35.851]  Well, at the time, it was real time.
[02:08:35.871 --> 02:08:38.573]  This was not a reenactment.
[02:08:39.074 --> 02:08:40.455]  These guys actually went and
[02:08:40.879 --> 02:08:42.459]  The wealthy homeowner was speculating to the news camera that
[02:09:02.772 --> 02:09:06.393]  Maybe they resented the fact that we had better guns than they did.
[02:09:06.553 --> 02:09:07.954]  Exactly, but it's worse than that.
[02:09:07.994 --> 02:09:11.295]  With a little old lady, high and dry, plenty of food, with her cats.
[02:09:11.835 --> 02:09:15.957]  And on the full video, she starts crying about her animals are going to die, which of course they probably did.
[02:09:16.637 --> 02:09:17.878]  And she's sitting there.
[02:09:18.238 --> 02:09:19.778]  They ask her to get her gun out.
[02:09:19.858 --> 02:09:21.619]  So she gets out the old .32.
[02:09:22.239 --> 02:09:24.000]  We later learn it belonged to her late husband.
[02:09:24.220 --> 02:09:26.081]  She's holding it sideways, not pointing at him.
[02:09:26.101 --> 02:09:27.621]  She goes, here it is, and it's mine.
[02:09:28.161 --> 02:09:29.762]  And the cops tackle her.
[02:09:30.493 --> 02:09:33.835]  So they ask you to pull the gun out, then they tackle you.
[02:09:33.915 --> 02:09:36.656]  So not only taking guns, but tackling old women.
[02:09:36.956 --> 02:09:43.219]  And as I listened to it on one of the repeated times I was watching, it's actually very distinct.
[02:09:43.300 --> 02:09:48.302]  It's just that there's so many shocking things that they don't all register at the same time.
[02:09:48.982 --> 02:09:52.404]  But one of these three big guys is saying, this is for your own good.
[02:09:54.185 --> 02:09:55.786]  Oh, it's always for our own good, yeah.
[02:09:56.875 --> 02:09:58.096]  Like a hole in the head.
[02:09:58.136 --> 02:09:58.857]  Exactly right.
[02:10:00.038 --> 02:10:21.336]  I wish we had the footage of it, but I subsequently read of some other Mounties that went to a guy that had been protecting his, I think it was a convenience store, with arms, of course, and he was disarmed by the authorities who knew better, and within hours, the guy's store was looted.
[02:10:22.375 --> 02:10:28.660]  Well, that's because the criminals hide their guns and hide out, and of course, it's all... I mean, we know this was a laboratory test.
[02:10:28.700 --> 02:10:30.121]  We know this was done by design.
[02:10:30.601 --> 02:10:37.466]  Then they claimed they were going to quit it, but we know that they're actually still going around trying it now, and they've put troops back on the streets there again.
[02:10:38.166 --> 02:10:47.453]  Well, when the lawsuit was brought, the rulings actually were in favor of the plaintiffs saying, give me my gun back.
[02:10:47.893 --> 02:10:50.135]  They denied for a long time that they had the guns...
[02:10:51.459 --> 02:10:55.762]  Thus showing that the government is obviously more trustworthy than the rest of us.
[02:10:56.502 --> 02:11:02.065]  When they finally confessed that they did have the guns, they said, well, people are going to have to prove that it's their gun.
[02:11:02.446 --> 02:11:05.207]  Well, isn't that an interesting little trick?
[02:11:05.707 --> 02:11:13.672]  They didn't give any receipts when they stole the guns in the first place, and so now people who might have, like this woman, she had her husband's gun.
[02:11:13.692 --> 02:11:20.376]  Well, obviously, she didn't get a receipt from her husband the moment he died, you know, saying, hereby bequeath this gun.
[02:11:21.016 --> 02:11:24.937]  So, there were a lot of people in that fix that just didn't have any weight.
[02:11:25.138 --> 02:11:27.658]  Well, it shows that possession is nine-tenths of the law.
[02:11:27.718 --> 02:11:30.359]  It's your gun, and they come take it from you, no receipt.
[02:11:30.379 --> 02:11:31.580]  And, of course, they don't even know.
[02:11:31.620 --> 02:11:33.080]  They just throw them in the backs of cars.
[02:11:33.821 --> 02:11:35.261]  And you never get your guns back, folks.
[02:11:35.321 --> 02:11:42.284]  And I read that they confiscated, like, $10,000, $15,000 carved shotguns, and you know they're keeping them for themselves.
[02:11:42.524 --> 02:11:43.444]  Well, those are, I mean...
[02:11:43.704 --> 02:11:44.264]  Come on, Alex.
[02:11:44.305 --> 02:11:46.566]  We know those are guns that are used in crime all the time.
[02:11:46.946 --> 02:11:49.268]  And criminals use $15,000 guns.
[02:11:49.328 --> 02:11:50.749]  Gee whiz.
[02:11:51.169 --> 02:11:54.351]  You know, these guys are just... What do they think that we would believe anyway?
[02:11:54.852 --> 02:11:55.672]  It's just amazing.
[02:11:56.533 --> 02:11:57.233]  Just amazing.
[02:11:57.273 --> 02:11:58.634]  So where is that all right now?
[02:11:58.654 --> 02:12:04.618]  Because I'm told, and I read in the news, they're back, quote, you know, doing weapon sweeps with the National Guard in New Orleans.
[02:12:05.859 --> 02:12:13.264]  They better keep their hands off because the state has now passed a law meaning that anybody that grabs a gun the way they did after the hurricane...
[02:12:14.068 --> 02:12:22.551]  They're going to have themselves a criminal suit brought against them, and they would also be able to be sued, which is probably more effective than a criminal suit anyway.
[02:12:23.491 --> 02:12:27.152]  But, I mean, going back, what is the... I mean, we know they went in there with the intent.
[02:12:27.192 --> 02:12:33.914]  They couldn't wait to get our guns, led by those Army trucks with FBI SWAT guys in the back commanding everyone.
[02:12:34.294 --> 02:12:37.435]  I mean, did the government think we were stupid and we would just accept this precedent?
[02:12:37.855 --> 02:12:43.057]  Well, I guess we're a little bit caught unawares by the TV cameras, and amazingly...
[02:12:43.542 --> 02:12:53.789]  Even though only one was national and it certainly wasn't made into a continuing story by ABC, the fact is the internet scores another one.
[02:12:53.849 --> 02:12:57.331]  We didn't see any one of these as they were broadcast.
[02:12:58.058 --> 02:13:02.721]  Because people had been sending them around on the Internet, we were able to get it and put it up there on our website.
[02:13:02.741 --> 02:13:06.984]  So that seems to me to be the downfall of what they're doing.
[02:13:08.464 --> 02:13:12.047]  In fact, ABC was acting like it was a good thing while it was happening.
[02:13:12.267 --> 02:13:13.267]  Oh, exactly right.
[02:13:14.528 --> 02:13:15.129]  Atta boy!
[02:13:15.449 --> 02:13:16.790]  Way to go, New Orleans!
[02:13:17.170 --> 02:13:24.494]  Actually, I think the ones that were filmed were California Highway Patrol and possibly Oklahoma National Guard.
[02:13:25.836 --> 02:13:29.479]  But in any case, it was a mixture of people.
[02:13:29.539 --> 02:13:30.679]  And we know that the U.S.
[02:13:30.719 --> 02:13:33.962]  Marshals were involved because the Washington Post reported on them.
[02:13:34.702 --> 02:13:37.784]  And they're not about ready to do anything to them either.
[02:13:38.305 --> 02:13:38.725]  You know what?
[02:13:38.765 --> 02:13:40.026]  We played this again yesterday.
[02:13:40.106 --> 02:13:41.026]  We hadn't played it in months.
[02:13:41.427 --> 02:13:42.407]  But it's important to play it.
[02:13:42.467 --> 02:13:45.269]  Scott, can you find that and play that little two-minute clip again?
[02:13:46.610 --> 02:13:47.571]  It's a real shocker.
[02:13:48.011 --> 02:13:55.096]  And I think, you know, when Representative Steve Scalise in Louisiana brought this up,
[02:13:56.040 --> 02:14:08.770]  First, at the end of last year, he couldn't get an actual law enacted because it was a special session, but he got a resolution enacted, and initially there were some people that were saying, well, yeah, but, but we don't want to tie the hands of the police.
[02:14:08.830 --> 02:14:11.212]  Well, if they're acting illegally, we do, of course.
[02:14:11.492 --> 02:14:19.838]  Yeah, that was actually, in fact, they tried to pass similar laws in Oklahoma, and one of their state reps said that this is good, we need to have the police be able to take the guns.
[02:14:19.979 --> 02:14:24.322]  Happily, he was voted down on that, but you're right, that was...
[02:14:24.807 --> 02:14:27.889]  Exactly the reaction of these people.
[02:14:27.949 --> 02:14:36.936]  Well, when Scalise showed these videos, I don't know whether he had a laptop or something, but he popped it up and went to our website and showed those videos.
[02:14:37.776 --> 02:14:40.858]  There were guys in the Louisiana legislature that hadn't even heard of this.
[02:14:40.918 --> 02:14:46.842]  So, sure, I would not be surprised that you've got listeners that haven't, because how would they have heard?
[02:14:47.243 --> 02:14:51.286]  Let's go ahead and roll the audio of the ABC piece.
[02:14:51.326 --> 02:14:51.746]  Here it is.
[02:14:52.631 --> 02:14:57.895]  That includes New Orleans, where today, authorities stepped up their efforts to empty the city.
[02:14:58.416 --> 02:15:02.179]  Bob Woodruff is there again tonight with an extraordinary human drama unfolding.
[02:15:02.239 --> 02:15:02.499]  Bob?
[02:15:04.241 --> 02:15:06.062]  That's true, Elizabeth, and good evening from New Orleans.
[02:15:06.102 --> 02:15:16.071]  Here, the police and the National Guard find themselves in a very difficult position tonight to try to carry out an order to force people from the city without actually using force.
[02:15:20.757 --> 02:15:23.619]  Today in New Orleans, they got a lot tougher on the holdouts.
[02:15:23.920 --> 02:15:25.741]  Police department, you're home!
[02:15:25.801 --> 02:15:29.824]  Not only the flooded areas, but New Orleans' driest and wealthiest neighborhoods, too.
[02:15:32.106 --> 02:15:32.967]  Police department!
[02:15:33.487 --> 02:15:38.671]  The police and National Guard going street by street, house to house.
[02:15:39.412 --> 02:15:43.114]  We need to make sure, too, that whenever we knock on doors, people refuse to leave.
[02:15:43.134 --> 02:15:45.016]  We need to make note, call it in.
[02:15:46.280 --> 02:15:49.961]  They say there are no orders to use force, just strong persuasion.
[02:15:50.321 --> 02:15:52.902]  Sometimes entering open houses with guns drawn.
[02:15:54.263 --> 02:15:56.543]  Instructions to disarm anyone inside.
[02:15:56.563 --> 02:15:59.404]  You say guns will be taken?
[02:15:59.444 --> 02:16:00.505]  No one will be able to be armed.
[02:16:00.745 --> 02:16:01.745]  We will take all weapons.
[02:16:02.435 --> 02:16:09.278]  That happened today in this wealthy neighborhood where homeowners had armed themselves to protect their mansions.
[02:16:09.338 --> 02:16:11.179]  Residents were handcuffed on the ground.
[02:16:11.659 --> 02:16:14.800]  In the end, police took their weapons but let them stay in their homes.
[02:16:15.300 --> 02:16:18.121]  They were a little bit threatened because our weapons were bigger than their weapons.
[02:16:19.862 --> 02:16:24.584]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[02:16:26.235 --> 02:16:29.337]  This guard unit occupied a church, using it as a base camp.
[02:16:29.698 --> 02:16:33.261]  They had to leave a note because they could not get hold of the pastor to get permission.
[02:16:33.501 --> 02:16:34.762]  It is, it is surreal.
[02:16:35.762 --> 02:16:39.045]  You just never, you never expect to do this in your own country.
[02:16:39.726 --> 02:16:44.129]  Chris Montgomery... So, now notice the spin they go, we weren't using force.
[02:16:44.169 --> 02:16:47.371]  No, they put guns to your head, put you in handcuffs and take your guns.
[02:16:47.692 --> 02:16:50.414]  That's like ramming tanks into Waco saying this is not an assault.
[02:16:50.674 --> 02:16:54.377]  So that whole piece, Larry Pratt, is riddled with propaganda.
[02:16:55.248 --> 02:16:56.689]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:16:56.849 --> 02:17:04.732]  And perhaps the saddest thing is that guardsman, a volunteer, saying that, well, you never expect to do this in your own country.
[02:17:05.213 --> 02:17:07.334]  But he was willing to do it.
[02:17:08.134 --> 02:17:11.175]  And that is the sad and rather frightening thing.
[02:17:11.516 --> 02:17:15.878]  Well, the Kurds ought to ask themselves why that's half their training now is confiscating guns.
[02:17:17.138 --> 02:17:21.060]  Well, they certainly put it to use in New Orleans, didn't they?
[02:17:22.046 --> 02:17:22.487]  Absolutely.
[02:17:22.527 --> 02:17:29.372]  Larry Pratt, give us a legislative update, if you will, when we get back on the other side of this quick break and tell us some of the things we're facing.
[02:17:29.693 --> 02:17:34.137]  And any good news, we'll get into that, too, on the other side.
[02:17:34.897 --> 02:17:37.159]  Gunowners.org is the website.
[02:17:37.199 --> 02:17:41.383]  My websites are jonesreport.com, infowars.net, and prisonplanet.tv.
[02:17:41.643 --> 02:17:42.504]  Be sure and check them out today.
[02:17:42.524 --> 02:17:42.764]  Thank you.
[02:17:45.939 --> 02:17:49.981]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:17:50.201 --> 02:17:53.582]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:17:53.762 --> 02:17:57.224]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:17:57.518 --> 02:18:00.759]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:18:00.779 --> 02:18:06.242]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:18:06.282 --> 02:18:15.906]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for a regular jog a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:18:16.046 --> 02:18:17.327]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[02:18:17.367 --> 02:18:22.829]  I mean, the idea of working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:18:23.309 --> 02:18:27.752]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:18:27.832 --> 02:18:29.213]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:18:29.374 --> 02:18:34.037]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com That toll-free number again?

[02:18:47.603 --> 02:18:48.645]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:49.045 --> 02:18:54.532]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:18:55.112 --> 02:18:55.593]  That's right.
[02:18:55.913 --> 02:18:58.196]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:18:58.536 --> 02:19:05.685]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.

[02:22:05.623 --> 02:22:06.844]  Larry Pratt is our guest.
[02:22:06.864 --> 02:22:09.465]  Coming up in the next segment, we'll get into your calls and other news.
[02:22:09.485 --> 02:22:10.466]  I don't want to keep them too long.
[02:22:10.486 --> 02:22:11.987]  I just wanted to get an update on what's happening.
[02:22:13.488 --> 02:22:17.590]  Legislatively, at the state and federal level, what are we facing, Larry?
[02:22:18.111 --> 02:22:22.654]  Well, the state level continues to be the place where some progress has been made.
[02:22:22.714 --> 02:22:23.054]  We've had
[02:22:25.176 --> 02:22:37.747]  I guess you could call gratification or enactment of what had been the common law doctrine in this country since forever, that you could defend yourself with lethal force if you're under attack.
[02:22:38.447 --> 02:22:49.677]  And many state legislatures are taking that principle beyond someone's home, their so-called castle, and protecting their right to do that out on the street as well.
[02:22:50.248 --> 02:23:01.211]  And what it does is very important because in the past, a malicious prosecutor can take somebody and make him prove that he was acting in self-defense.
[02:23:01.771 --> 02:23:08.833]  And when the burden of proof is on you, the cost goes up and the likelihood of conviction goes up as well.
[02:23:08.893 --> 02:23:11.593]  Well, that burden goes back on the state.
[02:23:11.753 --> 02:23:17.855]  There's just a lot of prosecutions that aren't going to be made because if they have to prove you were not acting in self-defense...
[02:23:19.048 --> 02:23:24.230]  You go in with a presumption that you didn't have before, and it makes a huge difference even how they color it.
[02:23:24.610 --> 02:23:25.331]  Sure.
[02:23:25.411 --> 02:23:27.912]  What about Vermont-style concealed carry?
[02:23:27.952 --> 02:23:30.012]  I mean, that is the Second Amendment.
[02:23:30.053 --> 02:23:39.236]  Why don't we get that in the state level everywhere, and then it'll be really hard for the police to twist that or the prosecutors into prosecutions against gun owners.
[02:23:39.396 --> 02:23:39.836]  That's right.
[02:23:39.896 --> 02:23:43.738]  No database to have at their disposal as well.
[02:23:44.178 --> 02:23:46.339]  Alaska has done that, and if you...
[02:23:47.524 --> 02:23:49.025]  We're to fly to Alaska today.
[02:23:49.065 --> 02:23:56.727]  You could open your suitcase when you get out in, say, the parking lot and put it in your purse or your pocket, and you're legal.
[02:23:57.747 --> 02:24:00.468]  Oh, by the way, most people don't know you're allowed to fly guns.
[02:24:00.508 --> 02:24:01.489]  You've just got to check them.
[02:24:01.829 --> 02:24:15.033]  You've got to check them, but all they do at this point is put a little orange tag inside the gun case, which is inside your locked hard shell suitcase, and I just described really what all is involved, and that's it.
[02:24:15.492 --> 02:24:21.938]  If you take ammunition and it's in factory box or something like that, you're fine as well.
[02:24:23.499 --> 02:24:33.708]  And I must say, I've found that initially it was a pain, and there were times when I had to show them their own rigs, but now they've become kind of ho-hum about it, and of course...
[02:24:34.415 --> 02:24:37.037]  And it's no big deal, at least at this point.
[02:24:37.077 --> 02:24:37.518]  That's right.
[02:24:37.538 --> 02:24:44.263]  To make the gun culture, which is the bedrock of American culture, survive, we've got to exercise the First Amendment.
[02:24:44.503 --> 02:24:46.985]  Possession is nine hints of the law.
[02:24:47.286 --> 02:24:48.787]  We need to possess the land.
[02:24:48.827 --> 02:24:50.368]  We need to possess the guns.
[02:24:50.388 --> 02:24:53.671]  We need to force the bureaucrats to understand it is our right.
[02:24:54.406 --> 02:24:54.906]  Exactly.
[02:24:55.107 --> 02:25:01.310]  And they've finally gotten to the point where they don't wet their pants when somebody says, I have a gun to declare in my bag.
[02:25:02.031 --> 02:25:13.877]  And you probably ought to say, in my bag, because if you at all look like a cop, they're going to bring the wrong forms, assuming that you're going to be the privileged one that can take it on board instead of sending it in checked luggage.
[02:25:15.138 --> 02:25:16.039]  But anyway, that's...
[02:25:17.209 --> 02:25:19.930]  That's one part of what's been going on at the federal level.
[02:25:20.671 --> 02:25:24.152]  We've got this UN conference going on as you and I speak.
[02:25:24.973 --> 02:25:28.494]  They're going to continue it through our July 4th celebration.
[02:25:29.875 --> 02:25:32.136]  Good old UN in their regard for America.
[02:25:32.156 --> 02:25:40.660]  And there was a statement that was made, and unhappily, you can see the handwriting on the wall.
[02:25:41.480 --> 02:25:43.401]  I'm willing to bet that unless we make life
[02:25:44.433 --> 02:25:56.296]  About like it was for Bush under, say, the Dubai Port deal, or the Helen, I just forgot her name, that liberal that he wanted to appoint as a judge as his personal aide, Myers.
[02:25:57.057 --> 02:26:00.958]  You know, the response to that skunked it.
[02:26:01.318 --> 02:26:09.140]  Well, something similar, I think, is going to be needed to get John Bolton, just John Bolton, re-nominated, because they're going to,
[02:26:09.858 --> 02:26:14.465]  They're fixing to drop him, and you can see a statement was made today by the State Department.
[02:26:15.066 --> 02:26:21.636]  And it sounds, if you don't read carefully, it sounds okay, reaffirming the Second Amendment.
[02:26:21.656 --> 02:26:23.719]  Let me see, it's a guy by the name of
[02:26:24.991 --> 02:26:25.991]  Well, let's be specific.
[02:26:26.011 --> 02:26:29.172]  I'm going to have to hold you over a little bit in the next segment to finish up.
[02:26:30.012 --> 02:26:39.935]  The UN back in 2000, in July, had a meeting in New York and said, civilian ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[02:26:40.335 --> 02:26:44.436]  And they tried to get a treaty the next year, which Bolton blew up in their face.
[02:26:45.131 --> 02:26:47.072]  And so now they're back at it again.
[02:26:47.092 --> 02:26:49.292]  I mean, Moulton's bad on the Warren stuff, but you're right.
[02:26:49.332 --> 02:26:51.513]  He has been good on the Second Amendment at the State Department.
[02:26:51.753 --> 02:26:55.554]  He absolutely is the skunk at that garden party on the Second Amendment.
[02:26:56.215 --> 02:27:00.156]  And we've got some pretty good information that Bush is...
[02:27:01.294 --> 02:27:06.939]  Pretty determined not to reappoint him, because, as you know, he's an interim appointment to Congress.
[02:27:06.959 --> 02:27:08.240]  And so it looks like the U.N.
[02:27:08.260 --> 02:27:09.061]  treaty could go through?
[02:27:09.081 --> 02:27:12.264]  In some fashion, yeah.
[02:27:12.404 --> 02:27:12.884]  Oh, that's huge.
[02:27:12.944 --> 02:27:14.866]  And when we come back, let me read you some of the language.
[02:27:15.026 --> 02:27:16.848]  Yeah, yeah, give us those details on the other side.
[02:27:16.888 --> 02:27:18.829]  Then we'll get to your calls, folks.
[02:27:18.849 --> 02:27:20.931]  I know you're holding 1-800-259-9231, but this is so important.
[02:27:20.951 --> 02:27:21.252]  Yes, the U.N.
[02:27:21.272 --> 02:27:21.972]  openly says they want...
[02:27:26.969 --> 02:27:29.010]  To confiscate all of your guns, okay?
[02:27:29.030 --> 02:27:31.151]  That's their official policy.
[02:27:31.211 --> 02:27:31.851]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:36.393 --> 02:27:37.293]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.794 --> 02:27:39.394]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.315 --> 02:27:43.016]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.757 --> 02:27:54.123]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:54.503 --> 02:27:59.188]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using rife frequency technology.
[02:27:59.528 --> 02:28:07.095]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Wright discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:07.495 --> 02:28:14.360]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:14.600 --> 02:28:15.981]  There are no side effects.
[02:28:16.301 --> 02:28:19.924]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:28:20.224 --> 02:28:27.249]  BioSolutions has over 550 programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:28:27.589 --> 02:28:30.551]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[02:28:30.971 --> 02:28:34.317]  For more information, call BioSolutions toll-free at 866-885-6625.
[02:28:34.357 --> 02:28:34.718]  That's 866-885-6625.
[02:28:34.758 --> 02:28:35.619]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:28:45.896 --> 02:28:54.140]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:28:54.400 --> 02:28:58.762]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:28:59.042 --> 02:29:07.966]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:29:08.166 --> 02:29:11.788]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:29:12.068 --> 02:29:17.115]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:29:17.415 --> 02:29:24.144]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:29:24.625 --> 02:29:25.165]  What about you?
[02:29:25.922 --> 02:29:31.265]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:29:46.385 --> 02:29:48.727]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:29:48.967 --> 02:29:51.009]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:29:51.149 --> 02:29:58.195]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[02:29:58.475 --> 02:30:07.022]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[02:30:07.382 --> 02:30:12.066]  Now for the first time, Calbin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.

[02:30:33.985 --> 02:30:36.548]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[02:30:51.005 --> 02:30:52.886]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:30:53.386 --> 02:30:56.208]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:04.692 --> 02:31:08.274]  Charles, Cliff, Ray, Steve, Tom, others will get to your calls.
[02:31:09.055 --> 02:31:10.595]  Finish it with Larry Pratt of gunowners.org.
[02:31:13.962 --> 02:31:19.244]  We're talking about the United Nations and attempts to sign international treaties, which they then claim that we're under.
[02:31:19.724 --> 02:31:22.485]  And we don't think these have a bearing on us, even though they're unconstitutional.
[02:31:23.406 --> 02:31:30.448]  You know, we have WTO treaties with this private group, and then it has more power over our trade than Congress does now.
[02:31:30.849 --> 02:31:36.311]  So Congress has been ceding or handing over its authority for decades.
[02:31:36.491 --> 02:31:38.412]  So where is this U.N.
[02:31:38.572 --> 02:31:42.093]  Small Arms Agreement treaty, or is that even the treaty you're talking about?
[02:31:42.974 --> 02:31:47.837]  This is the Accord Agreement, Treaty, whatever they finally might call it.
[02:31:48.277 --> 02:31:54.520]  They'll still say it's international law and it's supposed to apply to us, so it's dangerous no matter what it's called.
[02:31:55.240 --> 02:32:03.785]  But this is from a statement of Robert Joseph, the Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, two days ago up at the UN.
[02:32:04.585 --> 02:32:07.567]  Notice they don't have Bolton making statements on this.
[02:32:07.747 --> 02:32:11.629]  I think that's a sign in addition to the information that I've gotten.
[02:32:12.170 --> 02:32:14.372]  That they're going to try to force him out.
[02:32:14.913 --> 02:32:25.122]  But they're willing to go along with, this is quoting, aggressive steps to implement the recently concluded agreement on the marking and tracing of weapons.
[02:32:25.943 --> 02:32:32.248]  Well, we have serial numbers on our guns precisely so we can have gun registration in this country.
[02:32:32.569 --> 02:32:33.930]  We've had for quite some time.
[02:32:34.952 --> 02:32:38.655]  Effective controls on weapons transfers, both import and export.
[02:32:39.156 --> 02:32:44.881]  That means it would be even harder to import firearms that a lot of Americans have bought from abroad.
[02:32:45.422 --> 02:32:51.608]  As well as robust end-user certification, strengthening controls over international brokers.
[02:32:52.589 --> 02:32:53.369]  Here's my favorite.
[02:32:53.449 --> 02:32:57.193]  Destruction of government-declared surplus and illicit weapons.
[02:32:57.693 --> 02:32:58.074]  Come on.
[02:32:58.947 --> 02:33:05.173]  There are people in the world that need guns to defend themselves against government, and here we're supporting the destruction of guns?
[02:33:05.474 --> 02:33:08.016]  You've got Americans that would buy those guns in this country.
[02:33:08.496 --> 02:33:13.882]  Well, Larry Pratt, looking at this, we have Bush using the regulators because he can't pass laws.
[02:33:14.322 --> 02:33:16.144]  He tried to get the assault weapons ban passed.
[02:33:16.184 --> 02:33:18.786]  People tell me I made that up even when he lobbied for it.
[02:33:18.926 --> 02:33:19.587]  Oh, yes, he did.
[02:33:20.627 --> 02:33:22.728]  I mean, I've been at gun shops and they've gotten in my face.
[02:33:22.768 --> 02:33:25.390]  I mean, this is how delusional people are.
[02:33:26.030 --> 02:33:28.451]  And so we've got Bush attacking through the regulations.
[02:33:28.811 --> 02:33:31.372]  Then we've got, you know, the Democrats love it.
[02:33:31.753 --> 02:33:33.693]  And then we've got them internationally trying it.
[02:33:35.154 --> 02:33:36.815]  Since you were trying to jump in there, go back.
[02:33:37.075 --> 02:33:38.976]  Did Bush lobby for the assaultman's ban?
[02:33:39.176 --> 02:33:40.677]  He said he would sign the bill.
[02:33:40.897 --> 02:33:42.297]  And that was a public statement.
[02:33:42.497 --> 02:33:47.940]  And if he's willing to say that publicly, if you don't think he was lobbying behind the scenes...
[02:33:48.556 --> 02:33:52.439]  I want to tell you about this really wonderful bridge that you can buy cheap up in New York.
[02:33:52.459 --> 02:34:01.145]  Well, during confirmation, it was some type of plus that the media said that Gonzalez said he wants to go further than the assault weapons ban.
[02:34:01.225 --> 02:34:03.607]  He's a strong believer in gun control.
[02:34:03.747 --> 02:34:09.632]  When Gonzalez was testifying at his confirmation hearing, he said that's where he is.
[02:34:10.092 --> 02:34:13.975]  He was for banning the semi-automatics that he calls assault weapons.
[02:34:14.497 --> 02:34:16.899]  And that he did support gun control.
[02:34:17.319 --> 02:34:21.282]  He thinks it would make his brother, who's a police officer, feel better.
[02:34:21.302 --> 02:34:23.743]  I mean, I've got a question for you.
[02:34:23.783 --> 02:34:40.855]  What would you do, say, if you were in McBride's Guns here in Austin, like I was, and I probably talked to eight different employees, about five of them were fans and aware, and a manager had to come over and explain to the guy he was wrong, but two guys behind the counter go, Alex, we're tired of you saying Bush is anti-gun and that the assault was bad.
[02:34:40.875 --> 02:34:41.776]  That's a lie!
[02:34:42.296 --> 02:34:43.657]  And I didn't even argue.
[02:34:43.697 --> 02:34:45.399]  I just said, hey, man, he did.
[02:34:45.419 --> 02:34:48.301]  And the manager comes over and goes, no, Alex is right.
[02:34:48.661 --> 02:34:50.382]  I mean, what's wrong with those two guys?
[02:34:50.542 --> 02:35:09.697]  Well, for one thing, if their sources of information are not adequate, if they're not listening to your show, if they're not paying attention, if they're not on the Gun Owners of America website at gunowners.org, you know, there were gun groups today that were celebrating what was said by this Mr. Joseph, the Undersecretary of State for Arms Control,
[02:35:10.279 --> 02:35:18.826]  Because he did take a curtsy toward our Constitution and how he was going to uphold his oath of office.
[02:35:18.846 --> 02:35:24.250]  Yeah, just let us have this treaty, trust us, let us have a gun law, but trust us, we won't enforce it.
[02:35:24.831 --> 02:35:29.034]  And then, yeah, because then he goes on to say, but these are the gun control measures that we support.
[02:35:29.074 --> 02:35:37.241]  Now, since these things have been shown so many times to not have worked in our country, not to mention that they're unconstitutional,
[02:35:37.891 --> 02:35:50.760]  And yet here we have a State Department spokesman, a pretty big wig actually, up there saying that they're going to support all these kinds of gun control measures that don't work domestically, but somehow they're going to work internationally.
[02:35:50.840 --> 02:35:51.481]  I don't think so.
[02:35:51.601 --> 02:35:54.743]  And you've got an alert out on this right now at the gun owner's website.
[02:35:55.524 --> 02:36:02.989]  We've got a prior one on a Vitter bill that would cut off their funding if they are not behaving correctly.
[02:36:03.009 --> 02:36:06.432]  In other words, if they have another one of these conferences after his bill becomes law...
[02:36:07.219 --> 02:36:07.840]  We're good to go.
[02:36:32.711 --> 02:36:33.431]  It's amazing.
[02:36:33.751 --> 02:36:36.752]  Larry Pratt, give us that toll-free number for folks that want to call and join.
[02:36:36.772 --> 02:36:47.955]  Yeah, if they can't go to gunowners.org where they can join, they can call us at 888-886-GUNS.
[02:36:48.755 --> 02:36:50.955]  Larry Pratt, keep defending our Second Amendment.
[02:36:50.995 --> 02:36:51.956]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:36:52.016 --> 02:36:52.556]  You too, Alex.
[02:36:52.576 --> 02:36:53.416]  Thank you very much.
[02:36:53.436 --> 02:36:53.676]  See you.
[02:36:53.696 --> 02:36:53.896]  Bye.
[02:36:54.850 --> 02:36:55.230]  All right.
[02:36:55.691 --> 02:37:00.873]  Your calls are coming up and a few final news items, but shifting gears, Debbie Morrow, New Millennium Concepts.
[02:37:01.013 --> 02:37:02.854]  I don't know what to say, what to do.
[02:37:02.874 --> 02:37:07.176]  I believe passionately in Made in America products.
[02:37:07.276 --> 02:37:13.880]  I believe passionately in Made in America products that also sponsor this broadcast and our international shortwave global outreach.
[02:37:13.900 --> 02:37:19.823]  So you get a high-quality item, Made in America, at wholesale prices that also supports freedom.
[02:37:20.774 --> 02:37:21.415]  We're good to go.
[02:37:41.431 --> 02:37:44.352]  Drink Berkey water for a few months, then try to drink your tap water.
[02:37:44.392 --> 02:37:45.193]  It'll blow you away.
[02:37:45.233 --> 02:37:47.494]  I don't care if you're even on a well.
[02:37:47.574 --> 02:37:49.055]  Most of those have been contaminated.
[02:37:49.435 --> 02:37:53.777]  This is the tried and trusted, made in America, Big Berkey.
[02:37:54.417 --> 02:37:59.820]  Debbie, I want people to call you, and I want them to at least get a free catalog or at least get a sports bottle.
[02:38:00.960 --> 02:38:03.081]  I mean, now is the time to take action, Debbie.
[02:38:03.662 --> 02:38:04.262]  Yes, it is.
[02:38:04.282 --> 02:38:08.264]  It's truly important at this time.
[02:38:08.766 --> 02:38:37.662]  For us to really take into consideration, you know, how we're going to get our drinking water, especially, you know, with the different seasons of the weather coming along that's going to be happening, as well as, you know, in the southern states, we have a lot of droughts going on, and the contaminant levels in the lakes that we're getting our water from is quite a bit higher because of the evaporation of the water and not being replaced.
[02:38:38.174 --> 02:38:48.861]  And I had a customer call me today who's on the East Coast, and she's in a flood area, and they just were told that they need to boil their water.
[02:38:49.847 --> 02:38:54.389]  So, you know, it could be anywhere in the country that you need to take control of your own drinking water.
[02:38:54.529 --> 02:38:57.291]  And then a lot of people are in the habit of buying bottled water.
[02:38:57.711 --> 02:39:02.293]  Bottled water, just type it in, bottled water kills, or type in bottled water full of poison.
[02:39:02.734 --> 02:39:02.934]  Right.
[02:39:03.034 --> 02:39:12.979]  All the time, because they take water, a lot of times it didn't clean to begin with, and it sits there for sometimes six months, or just a few weeks bacteria grow, then you're drinking a bacteria cocktail.
[02:39:13.419 --> 02:39:14.800]  Right, and also, you know...
[02:39:15.305 --> 02:39:20.988]  People get water delivered, and then they never use it, and they store it in their garage or on their front porch.
[02:39:21.429 --> 02:39:34.556]  I mean, you know, you have these big, you know, 20-gallon Ozarka bottles on your front porch, and they're getting cooked in the heat, and, you know, the plasticoids are getting in there, and then you're drinking it.
[02:39:34.697 --> 02:39:42.261]  And really, it's crazy when you could just not only is the Berkey water good, it is so cost-effective because
[02:39:42.631 --> 02:39:47.113]  Why have water delivered when you can make it yourself and there's no effort?
[02:39:47.293 --> 02:39:48.674]  How many gallons is the $199 unit?
[02:39:48.814 --> 02:39:51.074]  It's 6,000 gallons.
[02:39:51.355 --> 02:40:01.019]  So it does 6,000 gallons, and then an average bottle of water is like $1 for a 12-ouncer, $1.69 for an 18-ouncer, or whatever they are, the big bottles.
[02:40:01.819 --> 02:40:03.960]  So how much money are we talking about saving here?
[02:40:04.400 --> 02:40:07.321]  Oh, my gosh, you'd be saving thousands of dollars.
[02:40:07.841 --> 02:40:11.763]  If you just take 6,000 gallons of water and divide that,
[02:40:12.355 --> 02:40:15.336]  By, you know, a dollar a gallon, even.
[02:40:15.677 --> 02:40:20.879]  You know, you're looking at, you know, $600 as opposed to $199.
[02:40:21.019 --> 02:40:30.084]  I mean, it's just ridiculous to be spending that kind of money on bottled water when you can make it yourself.
[02:40:30.504 --> 02:40:35.926]  Well, exactly, and this is the tried and true, trusted... Actually, at a dollar a bottle is 6,000 gallons, not 650.
[02:40:37.754 --> 02:40:37.975]  Yeah.
[02:40:38.476 --> 02:40:42.765]  Well, I mean, and we're talking about 12-ounce bottles here that are a dollar.
[02:40:43.246 --> 02:40:45.771]  So it's not a gallon a bottle either.
[02:40:47.391 --> 02:40:48.932]  It's time to call, Debbie.
[02:40:48.952 --> 02:40:50.952]  They've got a bunch of different specials going right now.
[02:40:51.092 --> 02:40:52.852]  Go to BerkeyWater.com and look at them.
[02:40:53.133 --> 02:40:55.473]  You get free gifts with the order of a water filter.
[02:40:55.933 --> 02:40:57.954]  Some of the bigger filters, you get two free gifts with it.
[02:40:58.014 --> 02:41:03.135]  Great videos, great materials, other sports bottle water filters for survival.
[02:41:03.155 --> 02:41:04.195]  There is so much there.
[02:41:04.255 --> 02:41:07.076]  BerkeyWater.com or go to InfoWars.com.
[02:41:07.116 --> 02:41:08.716]  We all have the same stuff on our shopping cart.
[02:41:09.660 --> 02:41:12.301]  Just list there in the comments section what free gift you want.
[02:41:12.341 --> 02:41:14.343]  We have a list of those right there.
[02:41:14.383 --> 02:41:16.143]  Or give Debbie a call today.
[02:41:16.223 --> 02:41:17.544]  Don't wait.
[02:41:17.564 --> 02:41:20.886]  1-888... Debbie, give them the number.
[02:41:20.926 --> 02:41:21.646]  It's 888-803-4438.
[02:41:21.866 --> 02:41:28.390]  Give them that number.
[02:41:29.010 --> 02:41:30.031]  It's 1-888-803-4438.
[02:41:30.411 --> 02:41:36.474]  And please leave really good contact numbers if you get the machine so I can call you back.
[02:41:36.534 --> 02:41:38.375]  And I will be working tomorrow...
[02:41:38.874 --> 02:41:40.015]  To call people back.
[02:41:40.215 --> 02:41:43.056]  So if you leave a message, I will be calling you back.
[02:41:43.516 --> 02:41:47.098]  Yeah, because there's just you and maximum two other assistants there.
[02:41:47.138 --> 02:41:48.919]  And sometimes you get overwhelmed.
[02:41:48.939 --> 02:41:53.941]  Again, this is a big national manufacturer and distributor of the British Berkeys if you want those.
[02:41:54.602 --> 02:41:59.404]  Debbie just deals for Jim Shepard now since I guess, how long have you been working for Jim?
[02:41:59.904 --> 02:42:02.847]  I've been working since 1999.
[02:42:02.967 --> 02:42:09.333]  So for six-plus years, she just handles the radio interviews and really gives you special personal attention.
[02:42:09.353 --> 02:42:14.338]  So if the phone's busy, call back, or if you call, leave a message, or just go to BerkeyWater.com.
[02:42:14.618 --> 02:42:17.341]  She takes those orders off every day, and they ship it out to you UPS.
[02:42:17.722 --> 02:42:20.444]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:42:20.764 --> 02:42:21.745]  Debbie, talk to you soon.
[02:42:21.765 --> 02:42:22.606]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:42:22.746 --> 02:42:23.247]  Take care.
[02:42:23.467 --> 02:42:24.387]  Thank you, folks.
[02:42:24.447 --> 02:42:26.348]  Seriously, you need to stop procrastinating.
[02:42:26.368 --> 02:42:32.550]  You need to call right now, 888-803-4438, and tell them Alex Jones sends you to take advantage of that.
[02:42:33.010 --> 02:42:34.631]  All right, let's go to the calls.
[02:42:34.711 --> 02:42:35.811]  Charles, you've been holding.
[02:42:35.831 --> 02:42:36.652]  You're a real trooper.
[02:42:37.012 --> 02:42:37.372]  Yes, sir.
[02:42:38.052 --> 02:42:38.572]  You're on the air.
[02:42:38.612 --> 02:42:39.553]  Charles in Louisiana.
[02:42:40.313 --> 02:42:45.895]  They've got a mandatory evacuation, I've seen on the news, and I think it's Pennsylvania.
[02:42:47.766 --> 02:42:51.048]  Are they confiscating guns up there, too, where all the flooding's at?
[02:42:51.729 --> 02:42:52.809]  I'm sure they will, yes.
[02:42:52.829 --> 02:42:56.911]  That's what their one big desire is, to get our guns so we can be real slaves.
[02:42:57.111 --> 02:43:01.053]  You know, I wanted to say about Mr. Pratt, he wasn't down in New Orleans or seen it.
[02:43:01.434 --> 02:43:02.074]  I've seen it.
[02:43:02.394 --> 02:43:05.676]  I was there with the firemen down here from Livingston Parish.
[02:43:06.451 --> 02:43:08.133]  Well, give us an eyewitness report, Charles.
[02:43:08.193 --> 02:43:09.794]  Well, you know, I reported it to you.
[02:43:10.015 --> 02:43:13.058]  They would... Look, when the news was there, they was harsh.
[02:43:13.098 --> 02:43:14.639]  They would tell people, turn around.
[02:43:14.679 --> 02:43:15.320]  Don't turn around.
[02:43:15.360 --> 02:43:16.401]  I'll blow your brains out.
[02:43:16.782 --> 02:43:17.522]  I want your guns.
[02:43:17.803 --> 02:43:19.785]  If I catch you with a gun, you're going to jail.
[02:43:19.825 --> 02:43:20.686]  You're going down.
[02:43:21.026 --> 02:43:22.948]  You know, oh, man, you should have seen... They were just like...
[02:43:23.428 --> 02:43:25.109]  Like they were on speed or something.
[02:43:25.429 --> 02:43:27.190]  They were just hyped up and crazy.
[02:43:27.410 --> 02:43:28.271]  Well, they love it.
[02:43:28.511 --> 02:43:29.652]  It's killing America.
[02:43:29.732 --> 02:43:30.852]  Feels good to scum.
[02:43:30.872 --> 02:43:32.633]  They've always wanted to be total bosses.
[02:43:32.693 --> 02:43:33.414]  And let me say this.
[02:43:33.434 --> 02:43:36.095]  They've always known that we're not their slaves and it's time for slavery.
[02:43:36.255 --> 02:43:36.996]  And let me say this.
[02:43:37.036 --> 02:43:38.157]  A friend of mine's got buses.
[02:43:38.197 --> 02:43:39.757]  We would bring them out of New Orleans.
[02:43:40.278 --> 02:43:43.600]  They did not go into the Lower Ninth Ward to confiscate.
[02:43:43.880 --> 02:43:46.441]  They confiscated on Esplanade, St.
[02:43:46.541 --> 02:43:47.322]  Charles Street.
[02:43:48.610 --> 02:43:54.536]  Well, they know that the wealthy and middle-class schmucks will roll over.
[02:43:54.596 --> 02:43:56.697]  They don't try that on the poor people.
[02:43:56.738 --> 02:43:58.619]  They would have been in a lot of trouble.
[02:43:58.639 --> 02:44:02.843]  Do you know they ran a policeman off a shed in a gunfight with some police?
[02:44:03.143 --> 02:44:04.685]  The knife ward ran them off a roof.
[02:44:05.385 --> 02:44:05.926]  You understand?
[02:44:05.946 --> 02:44:10.110]  They would just pick on the weak like that old woman.
[02:44:10.450 --> 02:44:12.292]  That old woman was 57 years old.
[02:44:12.312 --> 02:44:13.773]  They'd rassle her down on the ground.
[02:44:14.229 --> 02:44:19.271]  You know, she had a gun in her pocket, and she showed them the gun, and they wrestled her and took her to jail.
[02:44:19.291 --> 02:44:20.331]  53 years.
[02:44:20.531 --> 02:44:21.692]  Ain't they proud?
[02:44:22.132 --> 02:44:22.892]  Ain't they beautiful?
[02:44:22.912 --> 02:44:24.232]  Ain't they strong?
[02:44:24.553 --> 02:44:26.073]  They're strong little fellas.
[02:44:26.433 --> 02:44:27.594]  With 20 to 1.
[02:44:27.634 --> 02:44:28.794]  20 to 1.
[02:44:29.054 --> 02:44:31.255]  With their M-16s screaming at women.
[02:44:32.035 --> 02:44:32.515]  Let me see.
[02:44:32.555 --> 02:44:33.276]  You want some water?
[02:44:33.296 --> 02:44:35.456]  Let me see your bustline.
[02:44:35.496 --> 02:44:36.797]  Let me see your breasts.
[02:44:37.537 --> 02:44:39.198]  We got a wonderful military.
[02:44:39.378 --> 02:44:40.538]  They're so sweet.
[02:44:40.778 --> 02:44:43.239]  And when they go to the police, it makes them so much stronger.
[02:44:44.159 --> 02:44:49.463]  So you witnessed them, and there were mainstream reports that they were making women do things for food.
[02:44:49.483 --> 02:44:52.925]  I remember I was reporting to you every day, coming back and forth every day.
[02:44:52.945 --> 02:44:53.826]  Don't you remember?
[02:44:54.166 --> 02:44:55.547]  Yes, what were they making the women do?
[02:44:55.928 --> 02:44:56.728]  Well, not all of them.
[02:44:56.748 --> 02:45:00.051]  You know, if they'd be on a porch, they'd be passing the boat, and they'd have some water.
[02:45:00.091 --> 02:45:01.251]  I mean, they didn't have much water.
[02:45:01.592 --> 02:45:05.575]  They would say, show me something, baby, and she'd open the blouse up in the door, you know, a little...
[02:45:06.522 --> 02:45:08.086]  Juggle water, you know.
[02:45:08.166 --> 02:45:10.390]  How could you act like that when people are in trouble?
[02:45:10.671 --> 02:45:13.297]  Well, I mean, look what happened at Dome Stadium.
[02:45:13.577 --> 02:45:16.323]  They would put all the people in there, Mr. Jones.
[02:45:16.972 --> 02:45:20.753]  And listen, when they come out and ask for water, they would put the dogs on them.
[02:45:20.773 --> 02:45:22.174]  The guy was on the news.
[02:45:22.434 --> 02:45:23.855]  They would say, you want some water?
[02:45:23.895 --> 02:45:25.795]  And put one of them police dogs on them.
[02:45:26.055 --> 02:45:26.876]  It was on the news.
[02:45:26.936 --> 02:45:27.496]  I'm not lying.
[02:45:27.556 --> 02:45:27.816]  I know.
[02:45:27.836 --> 02:45:31.317]  For two days, the troops stood in front of food and water, and the people would rush it.
[02:45:31.598 --> 02:45:33.258]  And they'd go, look, things are out of control.
[02:45:33.298 --> 02:45:34.699]  We need martial law power.
[02:45:34.899 --> 02:45:37.840]  We brought a boat full of water.
[02:45:38.140 --> 02:45:39.400]  I went back the next morning.
[02:45:39.420 --> 02:45:40.381]  The water was still there.
[02:45:40.641 --> 02:45:41.961]  Helicopters were going over there.
[02:45:41.981 --> 02:45:43.942]  So why don't you drop the water off to the people?
[02:45:44.082 --> 02:45:45.963]  Oh, we've got to have orders on that.
[02:45:46.423 --> 02:45:48.564]  Then Walmart sent water here.
[02:45:48.584 --> 02:45:49.464]  They turned them back.
[02:45:50.064 --> 02:45:57.926]  I mean, Harry Lee, he was fighting to keep P&I level on the communication lines down.
[02:45:57.946 --> 02:45:59.146]  Let me tell you something.
[02:45:59.446 --> 02:46:00.366]  It was planned.
[02:46:00.747 --> 02:46:02.607]  It was planned for chaos.
[02:46:02.887 --> 02:46:03.187]  I know.
[02:46:03.647 --> 02:46:05.008]  And then listen to this.
[02:46:05.208 --> 02:46:10.469]  When they got ready to take them out after three days, they told them, we're not going to tell you where we're taking you.
[02:46:10.629 --> 02:46:12.770]  And they had a riot right there at the Dome Stadium.
[02:46:13.010 --> 02:46:14.410]  They don't tell you nothing about that.
[02:46:15.049 --> 02:46:19.213]  It was a martial law takeover laboratory drill, and everything you said is on the record.
[02:46:19.574 --> 02:46:22.096]  I swear to you, and I'm going to tell you something else.
[02:46:22.377 --> 02:46:30.105]  There's people shot that they have a special morgue, and this was told by me, by the people who work at the hospital.
[02:46:30.865 --> 02:46:36.251]  All the people's missing, and they're letting the bodies deteriorate because they don't want people to be shot.
[02:46:36.491 --> 02:46:38.093]  There was people shot.
[02:46:39.642 --> 02:46:42.464]  Don't, and I swear to you, Mr. Jones, I have never lied to you.
[02:46:42.484 --> 02:46:46.468]  Charles, everything you said other than that has been in the mainstream news, so I believe that too.
[02:46:46.528 --> 02:46:47.549]  Charles, good to hear from you.
[02:46:47.569 --> 02:46:48.449]  I appreciate the call.
[02:46:48.990 --> 02:46:50.651]  Cliff, where are you calling us from?
[02:46:50.671 --> 02:46:53.573]  Go ahead, Cliff.
[02:46:53.694 --> 02:46:55.975]  Yeah, how you doing there, Preacher Jonesy?
[02:46:56.015 --> 02:46:57.597]  I heard the governor call you Jonesy.
[02:46:58.077 --> 02:46:58.978]  Isn't that funny?
[02:46:59.578 --> 02:47:02.641]  Anyhow, I've got the CD Terror Storm on the way.
[02:47:03.320 --> 02:47:06.882]  I've got it set up to burn off a thousand copies of it.
[02:47:07.182 --> 02:47:07.582]  Good!
[02:47:08.082 --> 02:47:11.103]  And I've already contacted the mayor here to get an appointment.
[02:47:11.243 --> 02:47:19.287]  I showed him the deal and I informed him that it will be appearing that hour and 48 minutes on C-SPAN whenever schedule comes up.
[02:47:20.467 --> 02:47:31.072]  And I've notified, in fact I've notified, I've notified quite a few of them already, all the AM, FM stations here, and told them what's going on about the C-SPAN thing.
[02:47:31.432 --> 02:47:31.692]  Good!
[02:47:32.233 --> 02:47:40.919]  And I'm trying what I can do, and I just heard Charles talking, and believe you me, that happened, because something similar happened to me in another state.
[02:47:40.959 --> 02:47:42.721]  That's why I'm in another state right now.
[02:47:42.741 --> 02:47:50.966]  I mean, they tried to take me down, and I filed that deal and remembered the petition to repeal and rescind the Patriot Act.
[02:47:51.267 --> 02:47:51.547]  Yes.
[02:47:51.887 --> 02:47:59.853]  In a town in another state, and a half hour later when I left the city hall, I was stopped by a... Oh, yeah, that was Arizona.
[02:47:59.873 --> 02:48:00.653]  That was in the news.
[02:48:00.993 --> 02:48:01.654]  Oh, I'm telling you.
[02:48:02.606 --> 02:48:11.393]  And I was stopped, and it happened to be the FBI and an off-duty retired police officer that held me and another of my friends.
[02:48:11.473 --> 02:48:15.617]  Oh, that's terrorism, to try to get laws passed, to be involved with your government.
[02:48:15.837 --> 02:48:25.745]  That's exactly right, and I also ended up in jail, and they just automatically turned me loose, opened the door the next morning, and I'm about 30 miles from where I live, you know, and stuff like that.
[02:48:26.385 --> 02:48:29.108]  And they caused me to lose my house twice.
[02:48:30.310 --> 02:48:33.336]  I lost it once, got it back, and then they pulled some more stuff.
[02:48:34.118 --> 02:48:35.260]  But they're not criminal.
[02:48:35.300 --> 02:48:36.363]  They're good.
[02:48:36.483 --> 02:48:37.545]  They're good.
[02:48:37.565 --> 02:48:39.770]  Yeah, these neocons are also something, too.
[02:48:39.790 --> 02:48:41.253]  We're out of time.
[02:48:41.273 --> 02:48:41.814]  We've got to jump.
[02:48:46.218 --> 02:48:47.718]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.898 --> 02:48:50.999]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:51.119 --> 02:48:55.040]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:55.080 --> 02:48:59.301]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:59.661 --> 02:49:03.422]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:03.562 --> 02:49:05.463]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.563 --> 02:49:08.884]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[02:49:08.924 --> 02:49:10.004]  The medical bills.
[02:49:11.625 --> 02:49:13.646]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.786 --> 02:49:16.827]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:17.007 --> 02:49:19.909]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:20.349 --> 02:49:26.472]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:27.012 --> 02:49:27.712]  We're good to go.
[02:49:27.732 --> 02:49:28.213]  We're good to go.
[02:49:46.303 --> 02:49:49.307]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:49:49.667 --> 02:49:58.477]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:49:58.817 --> 02:50:03.483]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:50:03.943 --> 02:50:10.666]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:11.066 --> 02:50:22.852]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:50:23.312 --> 02:50:27.774]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:50:27.954 --> 02:50:30.274]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:30.294 --> 02:50:32.255]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:50:32.275 --> 02:50:33.476]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:50:33.556 --> 02:50:35.636]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:50:35.676 --> 02:50:36.657]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:50:46.894 --> 02:50:52.843]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:50:53.063 --> 02:50:55.326]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[02:50:55.527 --> 02:51:01.876]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[02:51:02.196 --> 02:51:02.857]  We're good to go.
[02:51:31.716 --> 02:51:34.817]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:34.977 --> 02:51:40.938]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:40.958 --> 02:51:57.241]  It's been a great broadcast today.
[02:51:57.281 --> 02:51:59.361]  Let's finish up with some more phone calls.
[02:52:01.315 --> 02:52:03.056]  Ray and Tehosh in Texas.
[02:52:03.076 --> 02:52:03.997]  You're on the air, sir.
[02:52:04.057 --> 02:52:04.477]  Welcome.
[02:52:05.798 --> 02:52:06.719]  Thanks, Alex, for having me.
[02:52:07.059 --> 02:52:07.539]  Yes, sir.
[02:52:08.460 --> 02:52:09.000]  Real quick.
[02:52:10.401 --> 02:52:16.005]  From a young age, I always knew that there were things wrong, and I only got into your show probably about a year ago.
[02:52:16.365 --> 02:52:25.151]  I've been listening to a lot of the things you say, and it's hard for me to think of what to do to be active and to make a difference.
[02:52:25.371 --> 02:52:26.151]  Tell me if I'm right.
[02:52:26.852 --> 02:52:29.954]  I think probably the best thing for me to do is to avoid...
[02:52:31.545 --> 02:52:38.389]  You're doing business with big corporations like the ones who can get airtime on national television.
[02:52:39.009 --> 02:52:44.372]  To me, maybe I'm right or wrong here, but they seem like that's the sensory organs of the New World Order.
[02:52:44.612 --> 02:52:50.495]  The people you do business with and the corporations who take your information and harvest it and do all the things they do.
[02:52:50.515 --> 02:52:52.677]  Well, yeah, you certainly don't want to buy from Walmart.
[02:52:52.697 --> 02:52:56.939]  And we need to get out of this whole commercial thing of you buying all this globalist trinkets and junk.
[02:52:57.532 --> 02:52:58.072]  We're good to go.
[02:53:23.795 --> 02:53:24.335]  I understand.
[02:53:24.595 --> 02:53:28.297]  The globalists can't do what they're doing, Ray, unless we step aside and let them do it.
[02:53:30.158 --> 02:53:30.618]  I got you.
[02:53:31.238 --> 02:53:32.099]  I appreciate it.
[02:53:32.119 --> 02:53:34.019]  Thanks again for all the hard work.
[02:53:34.720 --> 02:53:35.300]  No, no, no.
[02:53:35.380 --> 02:53:36.561]  Listen, I'm just doing my job.
[02:53:36.581 --> 02:53:37.241]  I appreciate it.
[02:53:37.261 --> 02:53:43.704]  I thank all of you for the support and the things you do and spreading the word.
[02:53:43.744 --> 02:53:50.647]  I hope everybody will go to Infowars.com right now and get Charlie Sheen's great speech or get some of the other clips we're putting up for free from the big 9-11...
[02:53:52.396 --> 02:53:53.529]  Meeting that we had in L.A.
[02:53:53.550 --> 02:53:54.157]  this weekend.
[02:53:54.762 --> 02:53:59.865]  Go get the article about the Bilderberg Group having people arrested and threatening to dismember them.
[02:54:00.265 --> 02:54:03.587]  I mean, we have sworn statements, people on record saying this happened.
[02:54:03.987 --> 02:54:06.208]  And it fits with the MO of what we've seen in the past.
[02:54:07.049 --> 02:54:08.610]  Get my new film, Terror Storm.
[02:54:08.670 --> 02:54:09.910]  Make copies of it.
[02:54:10.291 --> 02:54:13.933]  DVDs are now available at Infowars.com.
[02:54:14.013 --> 02:54:17.094]  Get your DVD now at Infowars.com.
[02:54:17.134 --> 02:54:21.897]  My new long-awaited film, almost 11 months in the making, Terror Storm, is now here.
[02:54:22.417 --> 02:54:23.438]  You need to get it.
[02:54:24.384 --> 02:54:30.307]  Go to prisonplanet.tv, get a 15-cent-a-day membership, and start downloading and burning copies to desks and giving it to people.
[02:54:30.688 --> 02:54:34.230]  It is up to you to take action, ladies and gentlemen, and I know you've been taking action.
[02:54:34.570 --> 02:54:36.231]  That's why so many people are waking up.
[02:54:37.191 --> 02:54:39.212]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Missouri.
[02:54:39.272 --> 02:54:40.033]  Steve, you're on the air.
[02:54:40.053 --> 02:54:42.174]  Hi, Alex.
[02:54:42.534 --> 02:54:42.854]  Hello.
[02:54:43.715 --> 02:54:45.316]  Yeah, I just got a couple questions for you.
[02:54:46.016 --> 02:54:48.397]  How do we eradicate the billboards, number one?
[02:54:49.378 --> 02:54:53.020]  Number two is how do we impeach these buffoons?
[02:54:55.768 --> 02:54:56.068]  Okay.
[02:54:56.929 --> 02:54:57.690]  Is that the questions?
[02:54:58.251 --> 02:54:58.952]  Yeah, those two of them.
[02:54:59.432 --> 02:55:01.995]  Well, I mean... I've got a few more, but those are the two that I've got right now.
[02:55:02.075 --> 02:55:04.958]  I mean, we can't get on air and say we physically want to wipe these people out.
[02:55:05.018 --> 02:55:06.019]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:55:06.039 --> 02:55:07.000]  I don't mean it like that.
[02:55:07.060 --> 02:55:08.642]  Let me just comment.
[02:55:08.822 --> 02:55:09.923]  Sure, we're low on time here.
[02:55:10.264 --> 02:55:10.604]  Let me just...
[02:55:11.986 --> 02:55:17.029]  We need to wipe out their programs of control, their American Union, their Federal Reserve.
[02:55:17.069 --> 02:55:25.994]  We need to educate the people about how criminal it is, take back our government and remove it, and then criminally prosecute these unsavory criminals.
[02:55:26.014 --> 02:55:28.096]  We can't help but do this to the people, though.
[02:55:29.036 --> 02:55:33.139]  Again, the general public is still not informed, though we're making progress.
[02:55:33.219 --> 02:55:33.619]  You are.
[02:55:33.679 --> 02:55:34.920]  I'm a carpenter here in Kansas City.
[02:55:34.940 --> 02:55:39.562]  We've got guys that work with me that have been just knocking me in the head about listening to you every day.
[02:55:39.622 --> 02:55:40.503]  They're tired of hearing you.
[02:55:40.868 --> 02:55:41.008]  Good!
[02:55:41.028 --> 02:55:41.128]  Good!
[02:55:59.346 --> 02:56:03.190]  I stayed off today just to get my phone with you, just to say what I'm saying to you now.
[02:56:03.330 --> 02:56:06.352]  Well, sir, you are a rich man.
[02:56:06.372 --> 02:56:07.453]  You've got four children.
[02:56:07.593 --> 02:56:08.694]  You're doing great, sir.
[02:56:09.255 --> 02:56:10.056]  You know the truth.
[02:56:10.116 --> 02:56:11.797]  You're more wealthy than David Rockefeller.
[02:56:14.279 --> 02:56:14.660]  Pardon me?
[02:56:15.080 --> 02:56:16.521]  The good Lord is with us all.
[02:56:17.062 --> 02:56:17.362]  Absolutely.
[02:56:17.382 --> 02:56:18.523]  The good Lord is with us all.
[02:56:19.064 --> 02:56:19.324]  Good.
[02:56:19.584 --> 02:56:20.465]  Listen, I'm out of time.
[02:56:20.505 --> 02:56:22.587]  I appreciate you calling in today.
[02:56:22.627 --> 02:56:23.548]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:56:25.908 --> 02:56:26.669]  We're good to go.
