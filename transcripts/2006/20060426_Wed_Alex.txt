[00:00:05.736 --> 00:00:06.376]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.037 --> 00:00:08.079]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:09.921]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.582 --> 00:00:11.403]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.144 --> 00:00:13.085]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.726 --> 00:00:17.410]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:22.036]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:46.913]  Yesterday we detailed a Texas Department of Public Safety, a state police pamphlet for the public saying that people wearing blue jeans, that have cell phones, that have children with them or don't have children with them, that are friendly to police, that go to rallies or demonstrations, are probably terrorists, go ahead and call the state police on them.
[00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:50.755]  And we have similar federally written pamphlets at the state level in Virginia.
[00:00:51.856 --> 00:00:54.377]  In Arizona, all over the country.
[00:00:55.337 --> 00:00:59.198]  Well, Pastor Butch Paw joins us coming up in the third hour today.
[00:00:59.378 --> 00:01:00.098]  He's a pastor.
[00:01:00.998 --> 00:01:07.560]  Detailing how they're recruiting the churches into the whole tattletale control freak grid.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.381]  Very similar to what Adolf Hitler did back in the 1930s into the mid-1940s.
[00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:14.121]  So, that is coming up.
[00:01:18.462 --> 00:01:27.832]  Later in the broadcast we're going to have open phones and cover just a huge mountain of vital news in the first two hours of the broadcast.
[00:01:28.252 --> 00:01:32.537]  And we will open the phones up and we will move quickly to your calls and take quite a few of them.
[00:01:32.917 --> 00:01:34.379]  The toll free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:38.177 --> 00:01:39.738]  And I'm going to news blitz when we get back.
[00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:48.605]  Majority in Army Times Poll think Rumsfeld should resign, as do most of the generals, but again, who cares what they have to say.
[00:01:49.346 --> 00:01:52.408]  Also, Vermont lawmakers to call for Bush impeachment.
[00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:55.030]  We'll get into that report.
[00:01:55.811 --> 00:01:59.394]  Missing bioterror substances have officials guessing.
[00:01:59.514 --> 00:02:02.736]  Oh, anthrax missing from government laboratories.
[00:02:04.372 --> 00:02:07.395]  Florida Attorney General wants probe of the coroner.
[00:02:07.735 --> 00:02:12.039]  There's video of the guards stomping the young boy to death.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.825]  And then another coroner looked at the body and said clearly he'd been killed.
[00:02:18.245 --> 00:02:23.731]  But the official coroner says no, the minions that did this didn't do anything wrong.
[00:02:24.785 --> 00:02:31.313]  Also, Bush tells Congress Report that there's progress on immigration bill.
[00:02:31.353 --> 00:02:33.055]  He loves the new amnesty plan.
[00:02:33.095 --> 00:02:35.398]  He's very excited about it.
[00:02:36.346 --> 00:02:56.155]  Meanwhile, Cargill, the big meatpacker corporation that's leveraged out all the small-time operations, is telling the illegal aliens that are the majority in their plants to take off the next few days to go protest and demonstrate to make sure that America is broken down, the borders are destroyed.
[00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:59.477]  So, as usual, big corporations behind the whole thing.
[00:03:00.017 --> 00:03:03.699]  And over in England, hunt for 900 dangerous criminals freed in terror.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.261]  In error.
[00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:08.844]  And this is the same thing we see here in the United States.
[00:03:09.424 --> 00:03:17.951]  The illegal aliens are released routinely for rape, murder, arson, armed robbery, burglary, hit-and-run, drunk driving.
[00:03:18.472 --> 00:03:20.073]  They're above the law.
[00:03:20.093 --> 00:03:25.597]  In fact, they even statistically are more above the law than the police.
[00:03:25.637 --> 00:03:28.360]  They're just godlike because they're special
[00:03:29.724 --> 00:03:39.849]  Protected group by the big corporations that want to pat American Union and are going to use predominantly Latin American hordes to do this, to destroy this country.
[00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:43.010]  So we'll get into that.
[00:03:44.191 --> 00:03:46.512]  Also, I want to read an email when we get back.
[00:03:48.073 --> 00:03:51.374]  It says, you are such an embarrassment to this country.
[00:03:52.055 --> 00:03:54.916]  We'll get into that little article first and then a story here
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.322]  Out of France, headline, French to test cashless city.
[00:04:03.463 --> 00:04:04.984]  Everything's going to be cashless.
[00:04:05.024 --> 00:04:10.146]  And notice it's the exact same system going in all over the Western world because we're under global government.
[00:04:11.446 --> 00:04:16.248]  A great article written by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, the father of Reaganomics, a real conservative.
[00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:19.409]  The world is uniting against the Bush Imperium.
[00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.991]  Also another story here on illegal aliens.
[00:04:23.311 --> 00:04:25.992]  It says that data on illegal immigrants has been kept secret.
[00:04:26.972 --> 00:04:30.714]  More on the CIA agent fired over supposed secret prisons leak.
[00:04:31.094 --> 00:04:32.354]  Denies culpability.
[00:04:34.435 --> 00:04:39.498]  And we'll get into some of the new bills they're trying to pass through Congress to destroy the internet, the free internet.
[00:04:40.078 --> 00:04:44.540]  China, Russia, Central Asian states to stage joint anti-terror exercises.
[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.742]  Brzezinski says airstrikes on Iran could merit the impeachment of the Presidente.
[00:04:51.443 --> 00:04:53.864]  And Iran's rattling their little saber.
[00:04:54.602 --> 00:04:55.843]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:56.023 --> 00:04:59.807]  InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, JonesReport.com.
[00:05:12.441 --> 00:05:15.042]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:15.082 --> 00:05:17.903]  The New World Order can emerge.
[00:05:18.223 --> 00:05:22.445]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:22.505 --> 00:05:29.428]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.568 --> 00:05:31.569]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:42.354]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.554 --> 00:05:47.916]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:06:02.802 --> 00:06:03.843]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:06:04.163 --> 00:06:06.946]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:07.227 --> 00:06:11.371]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:12.632]  So what do you do?
[00:06:12.952 --> 00:06:17.517]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:18.001 --> 00:06:20.123]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[00:07:56.698 --> 00:08:06.223]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.543 --> 00:08:08.844]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:10.484 --> 00:08:19.495]  Before we plunge deeply into the news that I mentioned in the last segment on this live April 26th Wednesday edition, let me read an email.
[00:08:20.325 --> 00:08:49.467]  that we posted in the reader comments leads and suggestions section of PrisonPlanet.com because the globalists are building a prison planet hence PrisonPlanet.com and people ask why do you have a website called InfoWars.com because ninety percent of the battle according to their own PR specialists that have written best-selling books bragging about how we're all a bunch of dumb slaves say that it's an information war so we're countering their lies and their spin with the truth but uh...
[00:08:50.362 --> 00:08:53.284]  This is about par for the course, the nasty emails I get.
[00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:59.887]  They are the minority, but when I do get them, they almost always say I need to be put in a prison or put in a camp.
[00:09:00.367 --> 00:09:02.028]  Oh great, I'm glad there's camps.
[00:09:02.068 --> 00:09:03.489]  Hope you go to one soon.
[00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.411]  But this was sent to us yesterday.
[00:09:08.512 --> 00:09:11.373]  You are such an embarrassment to this country.
[00:09:12.254 --> 00:09:16.216]  And with this war being a propaganda war, you are helping the enemies.
[00:09:17.165 --> 00:09:20.768]  In fact, it was a Muslim extremist who pointed me to your website.
[00:09:21.249 --> 00:09:32.158]  I just hope and pray they arrest you people for treason when this war is over, just as they arrested the two ladies with a radio station who were traitors of this country during the Vietnam War.
[00:09:33.861 --> 00:09:37.826]  Usually, the majority of Americans ignore crackpots like you people.
[00:09:37.886 --> 00:09:47.957]  However, since the winning of this war rests almost solely on who are the best propagandists due to the Muslim extremist terrorist blueprint being taken straight from Hitler,
[00:09:48.852 --> 00:09:54.116]  It's hard to ignore our enemies from within who are helping the terrorists win this war.
[00:09:54.616 --> 00:10:07.685]  You make money at the expense of hurting many people in this country, and at the expense of hurting this country, and I would certainly vote to throw you out of here as soon as possible.
[00:10:08.386 --> 00:10:10.167]  Okay, very nice email.
[00:10:12.193 --> 00:10:18.557]  Now notice how they start out with, and with this war being a propaganda war, you're helping the enemies.
[00:10:19.798 --> 00:10:21.039]  A propaganda war.
[00:10:21.539 --> 00:10:30.645]  I've even heard neocons on the radio say, sure we lie, sure we have fake newspapers and fake reports in America and overseas, that's good!
[00:10:31.266 --> 00:10:33.607]  That's how we win the war.
[00:10:35.028 --> 00:10:37.690]  The war against a country that didn't attack is called Iraq.
[00:10:38.698 --> 00:10:48.464]  When the Vice President wrote in a September 2000 document that Iraq was not a threat, but that they would claim that they had WMDs as a pretext.
[00:10:48.524 --> 00:10:51.006]  Now, Dick Cheney wrote this and published it.
[00:10:51.726 --> 00:10:56.869]  It isn't Richard Clarke saying it, it isn't the Treasury Secretary O'Neill saying it, or you can claim it was sour grapes.
[00:10:57.329 --> 00:10:58.150]  It's their own admission.
[00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:59.351]  Bush told his biographer in 1999.
[00:10:59.411 --> 00:11:00.711]  His biographer.
[00:11:02.051 --> 00:11:02.791]  Who he hired.
[00:11:03.191 --> 00:11:08.953]  That he's going to be a war president and attack Iraq because he can't be questioned domestically if we're in a war.
[00:11:09.833 --> 00:11:10.994]  So that's point number one.
[00:11:11.034 --> 00:11:11.934]  Well, really point number two.
[00:11:11.974 --> 00:11:15.735]  Point number one is you think lying and propaganda is good and okay.
[00:11:15.795 --> 00:11:16.175]  It's not.
[00:11:18.456 --> 00:11:25.778]  Point number two, you claim that we're fighting enemies that attacked us when that's not the case.
[00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:30.179]  And then you say that you hope I get arrested.
[00:11:31.363 --> 00:11:33.664]  It's called the First Amendment, my friend.
[00:11:33.784 --> 00:11:34.904]  America is America.
[00:11:34.944 --> 00:11:40.425]  The United States is different, supposedly, because we had freedom of speech and we still have it to some extent.
[00:11:42.185 --> 00:11:44.946]  And I don't know why you can't understand that.
[00:11:46.066 --> 00:11:49.767]  And then you talk about how I'm a traitor against this country, how I don't like this country.
[00:11:50.287 --> 00:11:51.647]  I love America.
[00:11:52.487 --> 00:12:00.449]  And the fabric of this country, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, everything enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, is being shredded, torched,
[00:12:01.065 --> 00:12:01.545]  Butchered.
[00:12:02.065 --> 00:12:02.846]  Decimated.
[00:12:03.066 --> 00:12:04.026]  Annihilated.
[00:12:06.967 --> 00:12:08.127]  Pot marked.
[00:12:09.468 --> 00:12:13.629]  It's being excised and crushed right in front of us.
[00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:17.291]  You know, you talk about a war on terror.
[00:12:17.391 --> 00:12:24.613]  If the war on terror was real, they wouldn't have totally open borders and 20 plus million illegal aliens running around.
[00:12:26.013 --> 00:12:27.414]  I don't want to hear it anymore.
[00:12:28.479 --> 00:12:30.501]  George Bush is anti-gun.
[00:12:30.601 --> 00:12:32.842]  Larry Pratt said he's worse than Bill Clinton yesterday.
[00:12:33.182 --> 00:12:37.486]  So has Congressman Bob Barr, former Congressman, NRA board member.
[00:12:38.506 --> 00:12:41.929]  George Bush has spent more money than all presidents before him combined.
[00:12:42.229 --> 00:12:46.332]  He has on average doubled every federal agency and now he's outstripping that.
[00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:48.834]  That's B-A-T-F.
[00:12:49.594 --> 00:12:54.658]  Department of Education, Department of Labor, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Transportation.
[00:12:55.606 --> 00:12:59.567]  He is not a conservative, he's not pro-America, and he's a puppet to begin with.
[00:13:00.908 --> 00:13:06.830]  You guys are so emotional, you're so mindless, and I get your comments on the streets occasionally.
[00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:10.911]  Somebody will pull up on a motorcycle and pull up in their car and go, You're a traitor!
[00:13:10.931 --> 00:13:11.672]  Get out of here!
[00:13:11.752 --> 00:13:12.632]  Leave the country!
[00:13:13.425 --> 00:13:19.370]  No, how about you leave the country and go to China or Russia, where they do arrest people for their speech?
[00:13:20.051 --> 00:13:21.232]  Why don't you get out of here?
[00:13:21.532 --> 00:13:24.654]  You know, I heard you on talk radio, you neocon callers and hosts.
[00:13:24.674 --> 00:13:25.635]  It was worse, it was callers.
[00:13:26.095 --> 00:13:32.561]  Last week, when that Chinese-American doctor, Mrs. Wang Weilong,
[00:13:34.667 --> 00:13:43.189]  You just simply stood up and said the Communist Party's days are numbered if they continue to abuse people, and you're like, good, arrest her, charge her, keep her in prison, she's bad!
[00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:53.952]  See, there you are, attacking the First Amendment and defending the most murderous regime in basic numbers, in cold hard numbers, the world has ever seen.
[00:13:54.052 --> 00:13:58.693]  See how far away from the roots and the spirit of the United States you've gotten?
[00:14:01.371 --> 00:14:03.192]  It's unspeakable what's happened to you.
[00:14:03.992 --> 00:14:06.332]  You know what, I'm not going to yell at you, I'm not going to scream at you.
[00:14:06.412 --> 00:14:13.254]  If you have these views, if you think I'm a traitor and should be arrested, I'm begging you to call in.
[00:14:13.914 --> 00:14:15.975]  We put you right to the head of the line, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:14:16.095 --> 00:14:23.517]  I've gotten good about letting people call in and disagree, even if it's pure baloney.
[00:14:24.637 --> 00:14:25.618]  I want to hear from you 1-800-259-9231.
[00:14:25.638 --> 00:14:42.512]  You got the cell phone in your hand, you're driving down the road in Austin, Texas, or Kansas City, or upstate New York, or Southern California, or Needles, California, or Pensacola, Florida, or wherever you're listening on the AMREFM dial, or the Internet at Office, whatever.
[00:14:42.532 --> 00:14:47.256]  And you're thinking, ah, that guy's a traitor, he needs to be arrested right now.
[00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:48.858]  Well, go ahead and call me.
[00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:50.079]  Here's the number.
[00:14:50.962 --> 00:14:53.703]  Are you afraid to call me?
[00:14:53.723 --> 00:14:54.603]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:14:55.144 --> 00:14:58.385]  Let's see if they pick up the challenge.
[00:15:00.145 --> 00:15:01.006]  They really never do.
[00:15:01.026 --> 00:15:09.729]  If people pick up the challenge, take up the challenge, disagree with me, it'll be, You don't believe it's all Jews and that they need to be put in camps.
[00:15:10.769 --> 00:15:12.030]  You're not radical enough.
[00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:16.151]  Or it'll be, You're a Christian and I don't like Christians.
[00:15:16.311 --> 00:15:18.572]  Or it'll be something stupid like that.
[00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:26.281]  And sure, you can come on, you can disagree with me on that basis, but I'm talking about the people that email me every day.
[00:15:26.301 --> 00:15:27.641]  Because I get thousands of emails every day.
[00:15:27.681 --> 00:15:28.422]  Seriously, thousands.
[00:15:28.922 --> 00:15:37.586]  And every day we get one or two of these, and it's always, I want to put you on a camp, you need to be arrested, I can't wait until you're arrested, you're a traitor.
[00:15:38.086 --> 00:15:39.306]  Tell me how I'm a traitor.
[00:15:39.767 --> 00:15:47.610]  You're aiding the Muslim extremists, they're going to kill us any minute, and they're going to get us, and they're sworn to kill everybody.
[00:15:49.497 --> 00:15:53.119]  Okay, let's just take at face value the false premise that you brought forward.
[00:15:53.139 --> 00:16:06.467]  They've done polls over in Central Asia and the Middle East, and about 6% do want to kill Christians and Jews, and do want to blow up everything, and it's serious.
[00:16:08.368 --> 00:16:15.172]  But when you look at that 6%, they're almost always openly financed by Mossad, Shin Bet, MI6, CIA, Defense Intelligence.
[00:16:15.192 --> 00:16:15.852]  That's mainstream news.
[00:16:16.817 --> 00:16:29.968]  You know, hundreds of thousands every year, millions and millions over the last three decades of radical Hadiths to go to the Madrasas saying, kill Americans, you know, three hand grenades plus three machine guns equals six.
[00:16:30.948 --> 00:16:46.521]  Our government after World War II went in, took over the Muslim Brotherhood, I've had former Justice Department and FBI experts on about this, our government went and set them up and tried to use them to overthrow elected governments all over the Middle East just so BP and others could get all the oil.
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.541]  The Arabs were not this radical 50 years ago.
[00:16:50.601 --> 00:16:53.802]  That is a historical, sociological fact.
[00:16:53.862 --> 00:16:54.943]  And the neocons will admit it.
[00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:59.324]  Alright, it's kind of blowback, Alex, but we got a problem now.
[00:16:59.824 --> 00:17:01.085]  Okay, we got a problem with this 6% now.
[00:17:04.487 --> 00:17:06.928]  It's not a religion of peace for that 6% definitely.
[00:17:07.268 --> 00:17:11.290]  They take the context in the Koran that does say kill the infidels.
[00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:13.251]  There's the other context in there.
[00:17:13.271 --> 00:17:14.471]  It's like the Bible.
[00:17:14.491 --> 00:17:15.352]  I'm not defending the Koran.
[00:17:15.392 --> 00:17:15.972]  I don't believe in it.
[00:17:16.012 --> 00:17:17.952]  I'm just saying there's multiple views in there.
[00:17:18.413 --> 00:17:19.613]  I've actually read much of it.
[00:17:22.728 --> 00:17:24.969]  Again, you're not being intellectually honest.
[00:17:25.009 --> 00:17:26.130]  You're being primitive.
[00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:28.250]  Well, they're over there and we need to kill them.
[00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:35.734]  But then they ask those very people on questionnaires facts about the Middle East, facts about the Near East, Central Asia, and you can't answer any facts.
[00:17:35.994 --> 00:17:37.094]  You don't know the history.
[00:17:37.594 --> 00:17:43.577]  You just emotionally are, the Arabs hit us on 9-11er and we gots to get them.
[00:17:44.731 --> 00:17:47.552]  Hey man, Alex, I'm in New York.
[00:17:47.612 --> 00:17:48.832]  They attacked us.
[00:17:49.232 --> 00:17:50.892]  They need to come out and play.
[00:17:50.932 --> 00:17:54.293]  We need to bomb them and turn them all into a glass parking lot.
[00:17:58.074 --> 00:17:59.694]  That's the kind of stuff we deal with here.
[00:18:00.594 --> 00:18:03.675]  And then you bring up the fact, okay, our government flew out the Bin Ladens to safety.
[00:18:04.015 --> 00:18:04.495]  No, they didn't.
[00:18:04.935 --> 00:18:05.695]  Well, yes, they did.
[00:18:05.735 --> 00:18:06.155]  It's admitted.
[00:18:08.156 --> 00:18:13.757]  Okay, well, our government props up Saudi Arabia, and the CIA's been involved funding Al-Qaeda,
[00:18:15.283 --> 00:18:17.584]  Republican report in 1999, Senate report.
[00:18:18.444 --> 00:18:20.605]  They used Al Qaeda against the Serbs.
[00:18:21.625 --> 00:18:24.806]  They've used them over and over again to destabilize and take over areas.
[00:18:24.846 --> 00:18:26.066]  They work for our government.
[00:18:26.526 --> 00:18:27.907]  And you're just like, no, it isn't true.
[00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:29.027]  No, it is true!
[00:18:29.087 --> 00:18:36.669]  See, just because you say it isn't true and have no facts, doesn't make it not be a total, admitted, historical fact, not debatable.
[00:18:38.689 --> 00:18:54.781]  And then you look at how our whole way of life is being changed, our liberties are being taken, they've got anti-terror manuals saying gun owners are terrorists, people that believe in the Constitution are terrorists, property rights activists are terrorists, people that wear Levi's and use cell phones and have children are friendly to police are terrorists.
[00:18:55.041 --> 00:18:56.182]  These are exact quotes.
[00:18:57.743 --> 00:19:04.988]  I have FEMA on video saying that the Founding Fathers are terrorists and Constitutionalists and Christians are terrorists.
[00:19:05.088 --> 00:19:05.809]  I have video.
[00:19:06.701 --> 00:19:14.224]  I have their own public training manuals and drills they carried out from the Associated Press saying that all homeschoolers are terrorists and need to be put in camps.
[00:19:14.964 --> 00:19:18.405]  Now listen, I got video of them taking guns in New Orleans.
[00:19:19.265 --> 00:19:27.928]  I got video I shot myself of Marines training to take your guns and put you in camps and it has nothing to do with people wearing turbans on their heads.
[00:19:29.649 --> 00:19:34.331]  The people that send me these threatening emails saying I need to be put in a prison are the ones that go into 7-Elevens
[00:19:36.079 --> 00:19:37.440]  They're of the same mindset.
[00:19:39.602 --> 00:19:41.224]  And shoot the Sikhs.
[00:19:42.224 --> 00:19:44.246]  Who have nothing to do with Muslims.
[00:19:44.266 --> 00:19:45.967]  A whole bunch of them have been blown away.
[00:19:46.228 --> 00:19:47.509]  He's wearing a turban!
[00:19:47.769 --> 00:19:49.971]  He's part of the Army of Allah!
[00:19:50.591 --> 00:19:51.272]  Watch this.
[00:19:51.632 --> 00:19:52.593]  I'm gonna go in there.
[00:19:52.613 --> 00:19:54.815]  I'm gonna shoot him with my shotgun.
[00:19:55.055 --> 00:19:57.037]  That Muslim piece of trash.
[00:19:58.938 --> 00:20:00.359]  I love George Bush.
[00:20:00.499 --> 00:20:01.060]  I love him.
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.741]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:20:05.901 --> 00:20:08.042]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:20:08.323 --> 00:20:18.428]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[00:20:18.748 --> 00:20:21.069]  Let me tell you something about the Calbin Pure Soap Company.

[00:21:02.313 --> 00:21:05.998]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:21:06.398 --> 00:21:11.825]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:21:12.286 --> 00:21:13.367]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:21:13.407 --> 00:21:17.453]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:21:18.093 --> 00:21:31.418]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:21:31.898 --> 00:21:37.221]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:21:37.501 --> 00:21:43.383]  Whether you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[00:22:52.913 --> 00:22:54.095]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:23:01.627 --> 00:23:03.628]  Gee, honey, your feet look great in those sandals.
[00:23:03.768 --> 00:23:04.109]  Thanks.
[00:23:04.389 --> 00:23:06.630]  Last summer I was too embarrassed by my nails to wear them.
[00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:08.752]  Well, your toenails sure look clear and healthy now.
[00:23:08.872 --> 00:23:10.273]  Makes me feel terrible about mine.
[00:23:10.313 --> 00:23:11.253]  See, this one looks thick.
[00:23:11.313 --> 00:23:12.154]  That one's yellow.
[00:23:12.234 --> 00:23:14.115]  What you need is Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:23:14.215 --> 00:23:17.377]  Non-X clears out the buildup that discolors toenails and fingernails.
[00:23:17.397 --> 00:23:18.818]  It's called Keratin Debris.
[00:23:18.958 --> 00:23:20.199]  Just apply Non-X daily.
[00:23:20.299 --> 00:23:22.340]  And I'll have clear, healthy-looking toenails?
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.381]  Just look at mine!
[00:23:23.541 --> 00:23:25.983]  The Dietrist Recommended Non-X Nail Gel.

[00:23:39.036 --> 00:23:46.300]  This low-mintage collector coin, with a total series mintage under $600,000, has sold at four times its current price.
[00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:50.042]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[00:23:50.422 --> 00:23:51.943]  Secure your position today.
[00:23:52.243 --> 00:23:53.424]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.

[00:24:02.253 --> 00:24:09.220]  Alright, I'm going to get into just masses of news coming up here in just 15-20 minutes.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:13.043]  Right now, let's go ahead and go to your calls.
[00:24:13.063 --> 00:24:16.527]  I'm going to move quickly through your calls, so make your points, ask your questions, and we're going to move on.
[00:24:16.567 --> 00:24:17.728]  No one called in disagreeing.
[00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:20.911]  Just, you won't defend yourselves.
[00:24:22.152 --> 00:24:23.333]  Jason in New York.
[00:24:23.393 --> 00:24:24.214]  Jason, go ahead.
[00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:36.212]  Speaking on the thing of propaganda, Alex, Dan Overy and I went down to the Tribeca premiere of United 93 yesterday, and we met up with some New York 9-1-1 truthers, you know, trying to get the word out.
[00:24:36.252 --> 00:24:37.834]  Of course, they put us in a free speech zone.
[00:24:38.739 --> 00:24:51.708]  Uh, but the interesting thing was, some guy was already there, and we just put him up on our blog right before we left, with a two-page flyer, basically, attacking, calling Dylan and myself, and then a, uh, 45-page word document.
[00:24:51.748 --> 00:24:53.369]  I'd love to be able to understand you.
[00:24:53.589 --> 00:24:56.791]  You're talking so loud into your cordless phone, or your... I'm sorry.
[00:24:56.871 --> 00:24:59.113]  ...or your cell phone, it's not really coming across.
[00:24:59.213 --> 00:24:59.693]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:24:59.873 --> 00:25:02.455]  Uh, I was just talking about the, uh, Tribeca premiere of United 93rd.
[00:25:02.955 --> 00:25:03.956]  Yeah, I understood some of that.
[00:25:03.996 --> 00:25:09.863]  And so they had somebody there already, just a few hours after you posted you were going down there, they're attacking you.
[00:25:10.423 --> 00:25:11.725]  Yeah, I couldn't believe it.
[00:25:11.745 --> 00:25:16.430]  He acted like he was there to help, and then every time we ran out of DVDs, he started giving out this disc.
[00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:21.295]  And as soon as we started questioning, he wouldn't give us his name, he didn't want to be on camera.
[00:25:21.896 --> 00:25:24.419]  I brought up World Trade Center Building 7 to him, and he just walked away.
[00:25:26.676 --> 00:25:30.098]  Well, they got a lot of spooks out there trying to counter us, but it's not working.
[00:25:30.258 --> 00:25:31.259]  No, it's definitely not working.
[00:25:31.279 --> 00:25:34.761]  I thought it was a testament to, you know, how much work we're being able to do and how we're getting the word out.
[00:25:34.781 --> 00:25:35.362]  What did you think?
[00:25:35.382 --> 00:25:36.142]  Did you see the film?
[00:25:36.562 --> 00:25:37.883]  No, we weren't allowed in, of course.
[00:25:37.903 --> 00:25:44.267]  I mean, we've been doing a, definitely planning on checking it out, but, you know, it's just there to reinforce the propaganda.
[00:25:45.568 --> 00:25:48.450]  Well, it certainly is that propaganda, but I saw it in the movie.
[00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:49.310]  It must be true.
[00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:54.894]  I'm sorry, Alex, have you seen some of the new evidence that they actually presented in the Miscellany trial?
[00:25:56.341 --> 00:25:56.742]  Uh, yeah.
[00:25:56.762 --> 00:25:58.663]  I mean, it's clearly manufactured.
[00:25:58.904 --> 00:26:00.505]  Oh, it's unbelievably manufactured.
[00:26:00.525 --> 00:26:06.931]  They have an unscathed red bandana, and then they have a CC Live identification card, totally unburned.
[00:26:07.011 --> 00:26:08.052]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:26:09.354 --> 00:26:10.054]  I know, my friend.
[00:26:10.094 --> 00:26:11.135]  I appreciate your call.
[00:26:11.315 --> 00:26:18.062]  At three separate sites, they found the intact passports.
[00:26:18.934 --> 00:26:20.275]  Everything else is destroyed.
[00:26:20.335 --> 00:26:21.635]  The black boxes are destroyed.
[00:26:21.655 --> 00:26:22.536]  Of course, that's not really true.
[00:26:22.576 --> 00:26:24.917]  They got them and hauled them off international security.
[00:26:24.937 --> 00:26:26.758]  Firefighters and others are now on record.
[00:26:28.339 --> 00:26:30.740]  And, uh, yeah, they just find everything now.
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:31.660]  Bandanas?
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:35.382]  I mean, you've got an 8-mile debris field in Flight 93, but don't worry.
[00:26:35.422 --> 00:26:38.023]  They've got all the evidence now that it was Allah Akbar.
[00:26:38.744 --> 00:26:40.545]  Uh, let's talk to Kenneth in Louisiana.
[00:26:40.565 --> 00:26:41.245]  Kenneth, go ahead.
[00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.790]  Hello, Alex.
[00:26:43.031 --> 00:26:43.271]  Hi.
[00:26:43.831 --> 00:26:51.476]  I heard about the huge military base they're building, I think 64 miles northeast of Baghdad.
[00:26:51.696 --> 00:26:56.280]  Yeah, they're building 14 megabases and over a hundred other permanent bases.
[00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:06.106]  Right, and I heard on Text Marshal that they had a chief rabbi anointing himself in the presidential chair of, I think, Saddam Hussein.
[00:27:06.586 --> 00:27:08.668]  And my question is to you, do you see
[00:27:09.406 --> 00:27:14.649]  The evolution of Iraq becoming a second Israeli state in the Middle East.
[00:27:17.211 --> 00:27:17.891]  Yes, I do.
[00:27:17.911 --> 00:27:31.220]  And also, the new individual, this Bolton person that they just put in head of policy at the White House, now starts every day's prayer with a rabbinical prayer.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.262]  So, it's pretty weird.
[00:27:35.003 --> 00:27:35.544]  Yeah.
[00:27:35.624 --> 00:27:36.444]  Also, one more thing.
[00:27:36.524 --> 00:27:47.194]  George W. Bush said he's going after illegal gas gougers, but the thing is, he's not going to find anything because they're legally screwing the American people.
[00:27:47.494 --> 00:27:48.095]  Well, they are.
[00:27:48.475 --> 00:27:49.696]  They are, and I appreciate your call.
[00:27:49.756 --> 00:27:50.557]  Fine points, sir.
[00:27:52.399 --> 00:27:56.382]  George Bush did this a year ago when they jacked up gas prices over $3 a gallon on average.
[00:27:56.623 --> 00:27:58.584]  I mean, it's $5 in some areas of California.
[00:27:58.604 --> 00:28:00.486]  What is it, like $3.20 now on average for 87 octane?
[00:28:02.688 --> 00:28:11.212]  And then they'll go bust a few stores, because the states will say, well, average gas price is $3.20 here in the state, so you're only allowed to charge $3.25.
[00:28:12.632 --> 00:28:24.097]  So they call that little 5% gouging by the gas station itself, when the gouging is being done by the oil companies and others.
[00:28:24.337 --> 00:28:26.398]  So it's just more bait and switch.
[00:28:26.438 --> 00:28:31.100]  It's like Bush, who openly wants total amnesty for the 25 million plus illegals,
[00:28:33.252 --> 00:28:40.599]  And then he says, oh, I'm launching a big investigation and I've got a bill to fix the problem and the plan is total amnesty.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.621]  But he calls it a reform.
[00:28:44.003 --> 00:28:55.694]  But a reform just means, again, if an 18-wheeler runs you over and breaks every bone in your body and you're dead, like a pancake on the ground with every ounce of blood squeezed out of you on the highway, you are reformed.
[00:28:56.568 --> 00:29:00.212]  Reforming something we've been taught with the language means it's automatically good.
[00:29:00.692 --> 00:29:02.734]  So we hear Bush saying, I'm reforming immigration.
[00:29:02.854 --> 00:29:03.935]  Oh, he's fixing it.
[00:29:04.035 --> 00:29:04.295]  No.
[00:29:04.836 --> 00:29:10.181]  It's like if a dam sprung a leak, Bush says, hey, I'm going to blow the whole dam up.
[00:29:10.221 --> 00:29:12.783]  That'll fix the leak because there won't be a dam to begin with.
[00:29:13.724 --> 00:29:16.767]  Yeah, it'll end the illegal alien problem because they won't be illegal anymore.
[00:29:18.829 --> 00:29:20.030]  So it's the same thing with gas.
[00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:21.231]  Ooh, I'm going to investigate.
[00:29:21.251 --> 00:29:22.352]  Ooh, I'm going to fix it for you.
[00:29:24.913 --> 00:29:26.474]  It's just so ridiculous.
[00:29:28.396 --> 00:29:36.001]  Alright, Brian in New York, Rodney in Texas, Ryan in Ohio, toll-free number to join us.

[00:30:01.753 --> 00:30:08.078]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:30:08.438 --> 00:30:13.122]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Wright Frequency Technology.
[00:30:13.442 --> 00:30:21.107]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Wright discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:30:21.388 --> 00:30:28.233]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease condition.
[00:30:28.473 --> 00:30:29.834]  There are no side effects!

[00:31:14.929 --> 00:31:18.415]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[00:31:18.675 --> 00:31:22.897]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:31:23.177 --> 00:31:27.119]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[00:31:27.339 --> 00:31:33.862]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:31:34.082 --> 00:31:39.564]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[00:31:39.804 --> 00:31:46.752]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.

[00:32:01.266 --> 00:32:09.792]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[00:32:10.012 --> 00:32:11.833]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[00:32:12.033 --> 00:32:13.174]  That's one in four adults.
[00:32:13.564 --> 00:32:16.566]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it.
[00:32:16.866 --> 00:32:19.648]  The American Heart Association calls it the silent killer.
[00:32:19.928 --> 00:32:23.591]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we recognize your concern for your well-being.

[00:33:09.548 --> 00:33:16.171]  I'm going to go back to your calls in just a moment, but I didn't get to this headline story yesterday that we had up on InfoWars.com.
[00:33:16.771 --> 00:33:20.213]  Australian government forces aspartame on school kids.
[00:33:20.333 --> 00:33:21.334]  This is out of the Australian.
[00:33:22.254 --> 00:33:26.276]  Sugar-filled soft drinks will be banned from school cafeterias in Victoria next year.
[00:33:26.916 --> 00:33:38.842]  But Australia's first state-imposed veto on sales of fizzy drinks to children has drawn fire from doctors who want water to be the only drink sold in school cantinas across the nation.
[00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:47.314]  And it goes on to say that, don't worry, no more high sugar foods, no more junk foods, in fact, no more fruit juices.
[00:33:47.775 --> 00:33:52.017]  No, you must have aspartame-laced food, which is wood alcohol.
[00:33:52.057 --> 00:34:07.906]  When the molecule hits 87 degrees for more than just a few minutes, we've had top scientists, Nobel Prize winners on this subject, it instantly breaks up into wood alcohol, and you know what wood alcohol does, it attacks the brain, the central nervous system, but like many other poisons and toxins, it is addictive.
[00:34:08.496 --> 00:34:15.760]  And what, it's 60 times on average cheaper than sugar, so it's now in over 9,000 foods here in the Western world.
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:16.780]  Here in the U.S.
[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:18.061]  it's in over 9,000 foods.
[00:34:18.781 --> 00:34:21.042]  And so, oh, we want you to be healthy!
[00:34:22.163 --> 00:34:32.828]  And if you go to Baby's R Us, one of the big mega baby stores to buy stuff if you've got young children, you'll notice it's all water fortified with fluoride and other minerals your child needs.
[00:34:33.688 --> 00:34:37.470]  And, oh, Pedialyte fortified with aspartame.
[00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:41.130]  It's diabolical.
[00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:45.712]  It's like a science fiction horror movie.
[00:34:46.632 --> 00:34:50.774]  And diabetes has exploded in the United States.
[00:34:50.794 --> 00:34:53.916]  I mean it's up thousands and thousands and thousands of percent.
[00:34:54.016 --> 00:35:00.159]  Juvenile diabetes is even up at higher levels than other forms of adult onset diabetes.
[00:35:00.519 --> 00:35:02.260]  These are all the numbers that we have
[00:35:03.007 --> 00:35:06.329]  And it's what alcohol has been directly linked towards triggering it.
[00:35:06.389 --> 00:35:07.789]  It fries your bloodstream.
[00:35:08.049 --> 00:35:09.550]  Your body doesn't know what to do.
[00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:17.294]  Literally, folks, it's like your cat or dog if you have a antifreeze leak and it tastes delicious.
[00:35:17.414 --> 00:35:21.376]  And I had a cat that drank just a little bit of antifreeze off the neighbor's
[00:35:23.598 --> 00:35:45.002]  parking lot driveway and and and our cat dinky and a few years ago we had to take the cat in and it basically was about to die and it was in a lot of pain and his kidneys had totally failed it was in a coma so we put it down a lot of pain before it went into that coma and uh... it's just a lot of things that are sweet that aren't good for you and
[00:35:46.135 --> 00:35:49.924]  I see so many people who are even quote patriots or truth seekers.
[00:35:50.104 --> 00:35:51.287]  I see them drinking Diet Coke.
[00:35:51.347 --> 00:35:55.517]  I see them, you know, you can't get Juicy Fruit or Big Red chewing gum now.
[00:35:56.610 --> 00:35:57.990]  Because it's got aspartame in it.
[00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:59.311]  It's all got aspartame.
[00:35:59.351 --> 00:36:01.511]  It's getting worse and worse and worse.
[00:36:01.551 --> 00:36:04.532]  But imagine, we're going to make the school children drink it.
[00:36:04.572 --> 00:36:05.892]  Now, they have done national studies.
[00:36:05.932 --> 00:36:07.592]  They've done it in public schools and private schools.
[00:36:08.052 --> 00:36:10.193]  Test scores explode upwards.
[00:36:11.153 --> 00:36:13.153]  Disciplinary problems implode.
[00:36:13.894 --> 00:36:15.174]  It is magic.
[00:36:15.314 --> 00:36:20.375]  It is a miracle when the children are fed healthy, balanced diets.
[00:36:22.279 --> 00:36:24.061]  And that includes fruit juices, by the way.
[00:36:24.121 --> 00:36:26.564]  Natural fruit juices, you can have good sugars.
[00:36:26.945 --> 00:36:28.947]  You're meant to have that part of a balanced diet.
[00:36:30.329 --> 00:36:38.899]  And they've done a lot of new studies showing that the official food pyramid is not the proper food pyramid for a balanced diet daily.
[00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:42.083]  And when they, I remember when I was in school,
[00:36:43.382 --> 00:36:51.845]  When I was about 17, I had a little roll of fat on me, kind of like I do today, and my mother said, why don't you just stop drinking, you know, how many cokes a day do you drink?
[00:36:51.865 --> 00:36:53.085]  And I said, oh, I drink, you know, two.
[00:36:53.125 --> 00:36:55.526]  I drink one at lunch, and I drink one normally in the morning.
[00:36:55.946 --> 00:37:00.407]  I quit drinking that and was still working out, and suddenly was totally ripped in just a few months.
[00:37:00.868 --> 00:37:01.888]  Lost tons of weight.
[00:37:02.583 --> 00:37:09.290]  But imagine the young people, they are drinking multiple sugar-laced soft drinks.
[00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:10.931]  They're eating multiple candy bars.
[00:37:11.231 --> 00:37:12.713]  There's vending machines everywhere.
[00:37:12.813 --> 00:37:19.700]  I saw students, when I was in high school and then in college, in between every class eating candy bars or junkie potato chips.
[00:37:20.881 --> 00:37:25.165]  And I learned early in life, every time I eat a piece of pie,
[00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:27.160]  Especially if I don't eat it after a meal.
[00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:28.281]  I eat it by itself.
[00:37:28.361 --> 00:37:30.141]  An hour later, I have a horrible headache.
[00:37:30.601 --> 00:37:32.141]  It causes a sugar crash.
[00:37:32.181 --> 00:37:33.262]  It goes into your bloodstream.
[00:37:33.762 --> 00:37:39.823]  Your body pumps out a bunch of insulin out of the pancreas.
[00:37:40.923 --> 00:37:42.524]  And it goes out into your bloodstream.
[00:37:42.584 --> 00:37:45.184]  It neutralizes the sugar and over-neutralizes it.
[00:37:45.424 --> 00:37:47.465]  And then you have nothing for your brain to feed on.
[00:37:47.485 --> 00:37:49.405]  And that's what the brain feeds on, is sugar.
[00:37:50.498 --> 00:37:52.379]  All right, now I've already been ranting about this.
[00:37:52.539 --> 00:38:03.147]  I just... It's so amazing that they're going to make the kids, if they want a soft drink, or sugared foods, or sweetened foods, drink this or eat this.
[00:38:03.967 --> 00:38:05.448]  Let's talk to Brian in New York.
[00:38:05.508 --> 00:38:06.429]  Brian, you're on the air.
[00:38:06.449 --> 00:38:08.190]  Yeah, I've got this.
[00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:10.892]  William E. Ora, B-O-R-A-H.
[00:38:11.172 --> 00:38:12.833]  He was an American Senator.
[00:38:13.034 --> 00:38:13.754]  Died in 1940.
[00:38:13.794 --> 00:38:17.937]  He made Senate speech against proposed Espionage Law.
[00:38:19.142 --> 00:38:19.422]  April 19, 1917.
[00:38:20.102 --> 00:38:25.463]  I'm missing, again, maybe I just don't understand you, sir.
[00:38:26.243 --> 00:38:27.224]  There was a senator in 1940.
[00:38:27.284 --> 00:38:29.804]  No, he died in 1940.
[00:38:29.924 --> 00:38:31.885]  Is loud enough?
[00:38:31.905 --> 00:38:32.405]  Is this better?
[00:38:33.185 --> 00:38:33.425]  Sure.
[00:38:33.585 --> 00:38:34.545]  And then something happened in 1917?
[00:38:34.965 --> 00:38:37.446]  He made a speech.
[00:38:38.006 --> 00:38:39.966]  Okay.
[00:38:39.986 --> 00:38:43.607]  Yeah, against a proposed espionage law.
[00:38:44.347 --> 00:38:47.868]  And he says, no silly shimmerer ever infested the brain of man.
[00:38:49.246 --> 00:38:53.809]  That you can't control opinions by law or direct belief by statute.
[00:38:54.349 --> 00:39:01.153]  No more panaceous settlement ever tormented the human heart than the barbarous desire to do so.
[00:39:01.993 --> 00:39:04.314]  So, was he speaking out against World War I?
[00:39:04.334 --> 00:39:11.378]  No, he was speaking out against the proposed espionage law.
[00:39:12.219 --> 00:39:15.260]  Oh, you're talking about the Sedition Act?
[00:39:15.661 --> 00:39:16.001]  Yeah, 1917.
[00:39:16.061 --> 00:39:16.381]  Yes, sir.
[00:39:18.996 --> 00:39:22.598]  You know, they tried to re-enact that law in Rhode Island two years ago.
[00:39:22.618 --> 00:39:26.260]  It was in the front page of the local paper.
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:27.861]  It was on the NBC TV station.
[00:39:28.321 --> 00:39:31.402]  Openly said, any criticism of government, you would be arrested.
[00:39:32.523 --> 00:39:35.645]  And it goes on, the field inquiry should remain open.
[00:39:36.005 --> 00:39:38.846]  The debate must be regarded as a sacred right.
[00:39:39.326 --> 00:39:48.191]  I look upon those who would deny others the right to urge and argue their position, however irksome or panaceous they may seem, as intellectual and moral cowards.
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:58.928]  Without an unfettered press, without liberty of speech, without what forms and structures of free institutions are a sham, a pretense, the sheerest mockery.
[00:39:59.288 --> 00:40:09.436]  If the press is not free, if speech is not independent and untrammeled, if the mind is shackled and made impotent through fear, it makes no difference on what form of government you live.
[00:40:09.697 --> 00:40:11.478]  You are a subject and not a citizen.
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:24.025]  The republics are not in and of themselves better than other forms of government, except insofar as they carry with them a guarantee to their citizens their liberty of thought and action for which they were established.
[00:40:24.785 --> 00:40:25.445]  Wonderful, huh?
[00:40:26.225 --> 00:40:27.666]  It is, yes.
[00:40:27.986 --> 00:40:33.048]  And of course, then they have the War Powers Act in 1933 to confiscate the gold, give us paper notes back.
[00:40:33.855 --> 00:40:41.923]  And they're now, the neocons are openly pushing to arrest Americans that disagree with the government, claiming it, quote, aids the terrorists.
[00:40:41.983 --> 00:40:43.865]  I appreciate your call, Ryan.
[00:40:44.826 --> 00:40:46.427]  Let's talk to Rodney in Texas.
[00:40:46.507 --> 00:40:47.348]  Rodney, go ahead.
[00:40:47.989 --> 00:40:49.130]  Well, Alex, how are you?
[00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:49.670]  Good, sir.
[00:40:50.091 --> 00:40:56.236]  Yeah, I've been trying to find something to disagree with you on for the past ten years, but I haven't been able to do it.
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:16.051]  And I've been listening, you know, when I first started out listening to you back in around 1995, 1996, I was a little skeptical, but so much of what you said fell in line with many of the prophecies from the Bible that, you know, you kept my interest over these years.
[00:41:16.151 --> 00:41:26.717]  And then what I started to do is each time you would read one of these headlines from a newspaper article, like Pipeline to Peril,
[00:41:27.856 --> 00:41:31.098]  It was that the Chicago Tribune did on the white slavery.
[00:41:31.358 --> 00:41:31.718]  Yes.
[00:41:31.958 --> 00:41:38.701]  I'd go and I'd do my research and I'd read the article and it would scare me so bad my hair would turn white.
[00:41:39.282 --> 00:41:41.463]  But you can't deny the facts.
[00:41:41.523 --> 00:41:52.548]  In fact, the journalist that did the research on the white slavery, you know, employed by the Halliburton, Blackwater, KBR,
[00:41:55.482 --> 00:41:59.224]  Well, to be specific, it was Halliburton and Dyncor listed in that article.
[00:41:59.965 --> 00:42:07.469]  Actually, just two days ago, I read that issue just reared its head again.
[00:42:07.569 --> 00:42:08.249]  Oh, I missed it!
[00:42:08.469 --> 00:42:09.330]  Please send it to me.
[00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:15.894]  KBR was listed in there also, and Blackwater, and... Was there another Chicago Tribune article?
[00:42:16.134 --> 00:42:18.695]  Yeah, the reason why... Oh, I missed it!
[00:42:18.955 --> 00:42:19.816]  Please send it to me.
[00:42:19.936 --> 00:42:21.637]  Yeah, because this general,
[00:42:22.304 --> 00:42:28.988]  He said that this is still going on and he had to send a memo to the contractors, the subcontractors.
[00:42:29.008 --> 00:42:30.869]  See folks, there's so much evil I'm missing it.
[00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:33.991]  What was the headline so I can find that article?
[00:42:35.192 --> 00:42:41.456]  All I know is that they referenced the Pipeline to Peril that was done in 2005, October 9 and 10th issue.
[00:42:47.381 --> 00:42:55.506]  And the reason why they referenced that is because, like I said, it became an issue again over there in Iraq.
[00:42:55.587 --> 00:42:59.129]  Once again, it's even more evil than what you first described.
[00:43:17.916 --> 00:43:25.639]  It's been all over the BBC, and it is admitted that child kidnapping rings.
[00:43:26.819 --> 00:43:35.002]  And they're involved in snuff films, they're involved in sex slavery, they're involved in just grabbing kids and selling them for adoption to families that don't know.
[00:43:35.462 --> 00:43:36.482]  It runs the gamut.
[00:43:37.283 --> 00:43:43.625]  Openly have at least two full-time lobbyists for Halliburton and Dyncor on Capitol Hill
[00:43:44.785 --> 00:43:52.947]  And that they are openly lobbying because the army, generals and others have been complaining about the white slavery in Serbia and Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:43:53.607 --> 00:44:02.570]  And they were begging the Pentagon to start prosecuting, because of course it's illegal, child kidnapping and sex slavery is illegal.
[00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:03.190]  Right.
[00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:07.292]  And nothing's going to be stopped, and Rumsfeld is blocking it.
[00:44:07.352 --> 00:44:13.035]  Now, we even have the audio clip of Rumsfeld a year ago being confronted by this, and he didn't even deny it.
[00:44:13.515 --> 00:44:16.816]  So, again, this is the type of stuff we're dealing with.
[00:44:17.357 --> 00:44:21.939]  And the monstrousness of the wickedness, you're right, it still blows me away.
[00:44:22.479 --> 00:44:28.902]  I mean, it's just pure, total evil out in the open, and they're going to do it in the open, and nothing's going to happen to them.
[00:44:29.597 --> 00:44:42.648]  Now, there was another article that you talked about the oil companies, how they boasted and bragged, and the LA Times did a big write-up on, you know, the inside information that they had obtained.
[00:44:42.708 --> 00:44:56.419]  And they have the documents going back to the 95-96 where they said, there's too much oil, we've got to buy up all the refineries and start shutting them down is the only way to stop oil flowing in, or we can invade countries to stop the oil from flowing.
[00:44:56.639 --> 00:44:57.400]  There's too much oil.
[00:44:57.958 --> 00:45:06.834]  Right now I referenced that article I was discussing this with a talk show host out of Chicago and he had heard about it but
[00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:10.410]  I had a hard time trying to find the article again.
[00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:12.731]  Is that posted on InfoWars anywhere?
[00:45:12.751 --> 00:45:16.872]  Yeah, we actually wrote articles about it, filled with hyperlinks to mainstream news.
[00:45:16.912 --> 00:45:18.272]  It wasn't just in the LA Times.
[00:45:18.352 --> 00:45:19.052]  It broke there.
[00:45:19.072 --> 00:45:21.132]  That was about ten months ago.
[00:45:21.273 --> 00:45:21.533]  Right.
[00:45:21.693 --> 00:45:22.673]  I forget the exact headline.
[00:45:22.713 --> 00:45:27.694]  It's something like, Oil Company Documents Show Staging Oil Crisis, or something like that.
[00:45:27.734 --> 00:45:32.795]  And it's just the documents from ExxonMobil, Texaco, Chevron, several others.
[00:45:33.355 --> 00:45:33.555]  Right.
[00:45:33.615 --> 00:45:34.555]  Now, one last thing.
[00:45:35.205 --> 00:45:38.047]  What do we know about this creature named Tony Snow?
[00:45:38.587 --> 00:45:39.768]  He's absolutely horrible.
[00:45:40.228 --> 00:45:43.510]  I mean, he's always been a White House operative, he's just now being official about it.
[00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:44.030]  Right.
[00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:59.439]  He has a talk show out of Southern California, fills in for the ultra-liberal big government pimp meant to snow and scam, keep the conservatives basically under lock and key, neutralizing us, and so Snow is running another snow job on us.
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:02.221]  Right, I just want to encourage people out there
[00:46:02.697 --> 00:46:08.758]  Before you start to disagree with any talk show host, go and check out their information.
[00:46:08.818 --> 00:46:09.958]  Check out their facts.
[00:46:10.438 --> 00:46:17.360]  You know, and if in fact you find something there that you can disagree on, then you call the person on the carpet.
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:22.560]  Let's not get into the name calling and these sort of things where you just waste people's time.
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:24.481]  Thank you, Elliot.
[00:46:24.581 --> 00:46:25.561]  I appreciate your call.
[00:46:26.761 --> 00:46:30.422]  By the way, people say, well, elements of the government wouldn't carry out a 9-11 attack and kill 2,800 plus people.
[00:46:34.071 --> 00:46:40.032]  And then we have all these official government documents like Northwoods and others where they openly call for doing this.
[00:46:40.073 --> 00:46:42.193]  These are operations they tried to implement.
[00:46:43.933 --> 00:46:49.375]  And then we look at white slavery rings, the UN's own numbers out of Eastern and Central Europe alone.
[00:46:49.955 --> 00:46:54.716]  Every year the number is around 1.2 million.
[00:46:55.856 --> 00:46:56.857]  Now think about that.
[00:46:58.237 --> 00:47:02.078]  That is twelve sports stadiums
[00:47:03.061 --> 00:47:29.909]  that hold a hundred thousand apiece twelve sports stadiums that hold a hundred thousand apiece and it is admitted it is in the open and who buys them they got big slave hotels all over asia all over saudi arabia all over israel it is hellish
[00:47:30.805 --> 00:47:39.229]  And when the media is forced to focus on it, they'll just show women kidnapped, taken over here, forced to work, they prostitute at night, and they work in textile factories by day.
[00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:44.892]  But then you read the big Italian reports, and it's blowing two-year-olds' heads off.
[00:47:45.372 --> 00:47:47.393]  They rape a two-year-old, and they blow their head off.
[00:47:48.274 --> 00:47:56.478]  And then they ship it out, and Americans get caught with it, and then the cases even get dropped because the FBI and others don't want to enforce it.
[00:47:59.143 --> 00:48:03.784]  I mean, folks, I'm not even going to get into what's in the news, it's so bad.
[00:48:03.824 --> 00:48:05.584]  I don't even want to talk about it, it's so horrible.
[00:48:05.884 --> 00:48:06.985]  But you have to face it.
[00:48:07.845 --> 00:48:11.145]  Imagine people that blow children's heads off.
[00:48:11.826 --> 00:48:14.306]  That's who runs your government, that's who runs your country.
[00:48:16.547 --> 00:48:20.987]  And they can pull whatever dirty tricks they want on myself or others that valiantly stand up, so be it.
[00:48:21.027 --> 00:48:23.668]  The truth's coming out on you people, and you're going to be exposed.
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:35.168]  I mean, if they can cover up 1.2 million kidnapped slaves, women and children a year, out of Europe alone, and then even when they get caught, because valiant DynCorp employees and U.N.
[00:48:35.208 --> 00:48:46.456]  employees go public, and then they get caught, and it's in the Chicago Tribune that they've got lobbyists, I mean, do you realize the magnitude of that?
[00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:50.761]  People say, well they couldn't carry out 9-11 and not get caught.
[00:48:50.801 --> 00:48:51.541]  They did get caught!
[00:48:51.761 --> 00:48:55.842]  And just like with the child kidnapping, they get caught and nothing happens because they run the enforcement!
[00:48:57.403 --> 00:48:59.503]  I'm told Peggy in Pennsylvania disagrees.
[00:48:59.804 --> 00:49:00.484]  Peggy, go ahead.
[00:49:02.524 --> 00:49:03.125]  Hi Alex.
[00:49:03.345 --> 00:49:12.107]  What I disagree with is your policy on not more overtly helping people who are really in dire need of help.
[00:49:13.428 --> 00:49:17.209]  I'm one of those people who's in dire need of help and it's just getting worse where I am.
[00:49:21.994 --> 00:49:24.015]  Let's just say that I'm a lawyer from Ohio.
[00:49:24.415 --> 00:49:27.437]  Yeah, you called and you said everywhere you go you're being stalked and harassed.
[00:49:27.477 --> 00:49:29.058]  Yeah, that's correct.
[00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:39.984]  When you have electronic devices and it's not illegal, and you've got a large group of people who are your enemy, they can do anything to you they want if the authorities won't do anything.
[00:49:40.684 --> 00:49:42.785]  I called the FBI again the other day.
[00:49:42.965 --> 00:49:44.146]  They refused to listen to me.
[00:49:44.746 --> 00:49:48.108]  From the very first when this started happening in Cincinnati, they won't even talk to me.
[00:49:49.111 --> 00:49:53.872]  Um, there's been a global positioning device in the car and an audio transmitter.
[00:49:54.212 --> 00:49:55.472]  Okay, have you removed it?
[00:49:56.953 --> 00:49:59.753]  I called every investigative agency in the world.
[00:49:59.773 --> 00:50:01.294]  Oh, you know it's there, but you can't remove it?
[00:50:01.674 --> 00:50:02.514]  I don't know where it is.
[00:50:02.594 --> 00:50:03.934]  I have no technical savvy.
[00:50:04.054 --> 00:50:05.355]  Well, how do you know you're being tracked?
[00:50:07.355 --> 00:50:09.235]  Because sometimes... Ma'am, do you have a cell phone?
[00:50:09.375 --> 00:50:10.656]  Because you're being tracked with that.
[00:50:10.676 --> 00:50:13.176]  No, I don't carry it because I heard on your show about that.
[00:50:13.356 --> 00:50:14.517]  I'm not imagining this.
[00:50:14.717 --> 00:50:15.197]  I have been, um...
[00:50:17.225 --> 00:50:25.728]  physically physically battered you know assaulted in various places Alex and I've also haven't been allowed to get a job in Ohio as well as a lot of other things that are happening.
[00:50:26.068 --> 00:50:26.328]  Okay.
[00:50:26.568 --> 00:50:29.209]  What I need is somebody who will help me.
[00:50:29.309 --> 00:50:34.511]  I'm willing to pay either an ex-FBI or CI agent who's a private investigator.
[00:50:34.691 --> 00:50:36.852]  Will you take my number and if anybody... No, I won't.
[00:50:37.012 --> 00:50:37.532]  I can't do it.
[00:50:37.552 --> 00:50:38.213]  Thank you for the call.
[00:50:38.273 --> 00:50:41.794]  I appreciate your call Peggy and I'll explain this when I get back.
[00:50:44.401 --> 00:50:52.647]  A government agency of half a million people couldn't help every person, real or imagined, that thinks something's going on.
[00:50:53.228 --> 00:50:54.969]  And I get these emails and calls every day.
[00:50:55.229 --> 00:50:56.250]  You must help me.
[00:50:56.350 --> 00:50:57.371]  You will help me.
[00:50:57.391 --> 00:51:00.794]  I don't have time to hardly brush my teeth.
[00:51:02.839 --> 00:51:05.681]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.941 --> 00:51:07.522]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:07.863 --> 00:51:12.526]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:12.886 --> 00:51:17.290]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:51:17.730 --> 00:51:21.933]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:22.133 --> 00:51:24.975]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:25.075 --> 00:51:27.577]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[00:51:27.757 --> 00:51:28.318]  We're good to go.
[00:51:52.301 --> 00:51:55.970]  That's InfoWars.com or AAA-253-3139.
[00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:59.519]  Or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:52:01.937 --> 00:52:08.160]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:14.462]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:52:14.742 --> 00:52:23.186]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:52:23.426 --> 00:52:30.449]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:52:30.749 --> 00:52:35.572]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:52:35.792 --> 00:52:41.176]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:52:41.536 --> 00:52:44.618]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:52:44.959 --> 00:52:52.924]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:52.964 --> 00:52:53.524]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:03.248 --> 00:53:03.588]  I think so.
[00:53:18.544 --> 00:53:19.145]  I think so.

[00:54:02.853 --> 00:54:05.934]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:11.043]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:11.283 --> 00:54:16.129]  When we start the second segment in the next hour, 8 after, I'm going to plunge into news for about 20 minutes.
[00:54:16.149 --> 00:54:18.371]  In-depth, a host of issues.
[00:54:18.391 --> 00:54:19.292]  You'll want to stay with us for that.
[00:54:19.312 --> 00:54:20.294]  Then we'll continue with your calls.
[00:54:20.714 --> 00:54:25.359]  We've got Pastor Brooks Paul coming on to talk about how Homeland Security is trying to infiltrate the churches.
[00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:27.462]  Very important news coming up.
[00:54:28.701 --> 00:54:46.395]  Dovetails with all these anti-terror training manuals being given to the citizens and the police that list everything from wearing blue jeans, having cell phones, being nice to the police, being involved in political activities, you're insured to be a terrorist, almanacs, driving almanacs in your car, as wide as possible to demonize everyone.
[00:54:47.836 --> 00:54:56.143]  You know, the lady earlier, I don't mean to sound cavalier or cold, but she's called before and then I don't want to try to assess her situation.
[00:54:57.714 --> 00:55:07.363]  I'm a pretty big fish in the fight against the New World Order, and I've dealt with real harassment, real problems in the past, and as soon as I just told them I didn't care, do whatever they gotta do, they left me alone.
[00:55:08.965 --> 00:55:14.250]  Stuff happens like you get audited, or people in a parking lot try to beat you down, four guys telling you to shut up.
[00:55:15.191 --> 00:55:19.615]  You know why we're here, time for you to shut up, or next time you'll be six feet under.
[00:55:21.667 --> 00:55:25.810]  But at the same time, I've been accosted at public events, at the TV station, all over our people.
[00:55:26.110 --> 00:55:27.932]  I've got transmitters in my teeth, you know.
[00:55:29.353 --> 00:55:30.434]  The government's getting me.
[00:55:30.834 --> 00:55:31.515]  They're after me.
[00:55:31.575 --> 00:55:31.975]  Help me!
[00:55:32.035 --> 00:55:32.435]  Help me!
[00:55:33.076 --> 00:55:35.698]  I've got all that going on, which may be real, may be not.
[00:55:36.038 --> 00:55:37.299]  In some cases, we know it's not.
[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:39.701]  Meanwhile, my phone rings off the hook.
[00:55:39.741 --> 00:55:41.222]  CPS is taking my children.
[00:55:41.982 --> 00:55:42.943]  They're taking my farm.
[00:55:42.963 --> 00:55:44.004]  They're taking my ranch.
[00:55:44.971 --> 00:55:53.199]  They're taking my house and car without drugs being even found because they found potting soil in my rose garden and they say that's drug paraphernalia.
[00:55:53.419 --> 00:55:59.024]  And then a week later after they call me, it's in the Associated Press, saying Portland, Oregon and the U.S.
[00:55:59.144 --> 00:56:06.530]  Army with APCs raids the entire neighborhood, middle class, and arrests people for cooking scales in their kitchens and potting soil.
[00:56:06.811 --> 00:56:07.691]  And that's real!
[00:56:08.072 --> 00:56:10.594]  And I quote, can't help them, I can have them on the show.
[00:56:12.193 --> 00:56:17.038]  So we've got all this real stuff going on that I'm literally drowning in.
[00:56:17.078 --> 00:56:17.799]  I mean, the phone.
[00:56:18.299 --> 00:56:20.321]  So many times my employees are paid.
[00:56:20.822 --> 00:56:22.523]  They have a list when somebody calls us.
[00:56:22.543 --> 00:56:24.065]  Okay, you're having trouble with CPS.
[00:56:24.105 --> 00:56:25.847]  Here's the names of four different groups.
[00:56:25.867 --> 00:56:30.591]  We can't guarantee that they're perfect and we're not giving you legal advice, but here are the four groups.
[00:56:31.372 --> 00:56:33.094]  Here's some land rights organizations.
[00:56:33.354 --> 00:56:34.215]  I've already called them.
[00:56:34.235 --> 00:56:34.956]  They're not helping.
[00:56:34.996 --> 00:56:35.997]  You've got to help me!
[00:56:37.173 --> 00:56:37.633]  You're not!
[00:56:37.673 --> 00:56:38.354]  You're bad!
[00:56:38.374 --> 00:56:41.196]  Or I get emails, you don't email me back.
[00:56:41.236 --> 00:56:44.978]  Or I get an auto response from your email, but Jeb Bush emailed me back.
[00:56:45.058 --> 00:56:46.099]  It's really from him.
[00:56:46.499 --> 00:56:51.542]  No, it's from a legislative aide, but... You don't care about us!
[00:56:51.562 --> 00:56:52.543]  You're not helping us!
[00:56:52.563 --> 00:56:53.243]  Do you understand?
[00:56:53.403 --> 00:56:54.844]  We've got three phone lines up here.
[00:56:55.165 --> 00:56:55.945]  One of them is public.
[00:56:56.025 --> 00:56:57.406]  It rings off the hook.
[00:57:00.768 --> 00:57:02.950]  And I just don't have the money for the staff to do this.
[00:57:03.030 --> 00:57:06.492]  I mean, maybe if I got some hundred million dollar endowment, I could hire
[00:57:07.479 --> 00:57:14.744]  50, 60 employees and have a big building and just have them answering the phone and then sure enough people wouldn't like the advice they got and I'd get sued for it.
[00:57:15.564 --> 00:57:18.246]  I'm not a aid agency.
[00:57:18.326 --> 00:57:19.487]  I'm not the Red Cross.
[00:57:20.147 --> 00:57:20.927]  I can't do it.
[00:57:22.989 --> 00:57:24.870]  And so I'm being stalked everywhere I move.
[00:57:25.110 --> 00:57:25.770]  They're getting me.
[00:57:25.810 --> 00:57:26.411]  They're after me.
[00:57:26.451 --> 00:57:27.972]  There's transponders in my car.
[00:57:28.872 --> 00:57:29.993]  Yeah, your license plate is.
[00:57:30.033 --> 00:57:31.694]  Everybody's being scanned by the cameras.
[00:57:32.441 --> 00:57:34.343]  Yeah, every cell phone's a tracker.
[00:57:34.363 --> 00:57:35.144]  That's federal law.
[00:57:35.425 --> 00:57:37.147]  Every phone call goes to the NSA.
[00:57:37.747 --> 00:57:40.291]  But that doesn't mean they can listen to it all or do anything with it all.
[00:57:40.551 --> 00:57:43.074]  Most people in government are now on our side waking up.
[00:57:45.296 --> 00:57:48.519]  So a lot of people are running scared, and you need to just stop having that attitude.
[00:57:48.839 --> 00:57:55.864]  When you're all freaked out around people, and act paranoid, and try to get jobs, and go in to get a job, and tell them, the government's after me, oh, can I have a job?
[00:57:56.084 --> 00:57:56.925]  You're not going to get the job.
[00:57:57.425 --> 00:58:01.408]  Act like a winner, act like you're not afraid, and your whole paradigm will shift, okay?
[00:58:01.468 --> 00:58:02.469]  I can give you that advice.
[00:58:03.890 --> 00:58:07.293]  Now, I don't know about your personal case, and I'm sure it may be real, whatever.
[00:58:07.733 --> 00:58:08.634]  I just, you know,
[00:58:09.677 --> 00:58:11.319]  All the time I get, you're not doing enough.
[00:58:11.359 --> 00:58:12.960]  You need to stage a demonstration about 9-11.
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:14.301]  You're not doing enough.
[00:58:14.321 --> 00:58:15.322]  You need to sue the government.
[00:58:15.582 --> 00:58:16.423]  You're not doing enough.
[00:58:16.463 --> 00:58:18.945]  You need to... Hey man, I'm doing enough, okay?
[00:58:18.965 --> 00:58:20.326]  I'm doing as much as I can.
[00:58:20.866 --> 00:58:23.048]  I was up here working at 11 o'clock last night.
[00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:26.011]  And that's an early evening.
[00:58:27.952 --> 00:58:29.414]  Now see, I just addressed that.
[00:58:29.914 --> 00:58:30.895]  Total waste of time.
[00:58:31.807 --> 00:58:33.408]  And I didn't even plug my videos.
[00:58:33.528 --> 00:58:35.269]  Want to see the video and book score online?

[00:58:59.236 --> 00:59:00.277]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.998 --> 00:59:02.099]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.759 --> 00:59:03.580]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.321 --> 00:59:05.221]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.241 --> 00:59:09.685]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.086 --> 00:59:14.209]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:19.394 --> 00:59:25.039]  Major polls show 90% of Americans are against Bush's police state policies.
[00:59:27.125 --> 00:59:30.148]  Majority in Army Times Polls think Rumsfeld should resign.
[00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:34.031]  There's a ton of news coming up in the next segment right now.
[00:59:34.792 --> 00:59:36.113]  Let's go back to your calls.
[00:59:36.853 --> 00:59:38.915]  Let's talk to Daniel in New York.
[00:59:38.955 --> 00:59:39.596]  Welcome, Daniel.
[00:59:40.256 --> 00:59:40.736]  Hey, Alex.
[00:59:40.756 --> 00:59:41.317]  How you doing?
[00:59:41.457 --> 00:59:41.817]  Good, sir.
[00:59:41.877 --> 00:59:49.584]  I just did United premiere last night at the 68th Street Lowe's.
[00:59:49.824 --> 00:59:50.845]  Yeah, the new Flight 93 property.
[00:59:50.925 --> 00:59:52.026]  Right, right, right.
[00:59:52.186 --> 00:59:53.067]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:59:53.087 --> 00:59:54.468]  And then I did the after party.
[00:59:55.650 --> 01:00:24.427]  and it was a kind of a sickening display of people just have partying after supposedly a sad movie that they put out and you had Ron Perlman and Commissioner Kelly and everybody just having a good old party after something which you know the movie everybody was crying after the movie and here they are showing up at a party afterwards just partying, dancing, drinking and you know like nothing ever happened it's uh... it was a sickening display
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:29.962]  Well, the government did throw parties after 9-11.
[01:00:30.002 --> 01:00:49.169]  Bush went to the CIA headquarters about a week after 9-11 and they gave him a standing ovation in the foyer as he stood on the seal and I saw Chuckie Schumer on TV giggling and laughing because they know this is their pretext to enslave us.
[01:00:50.090 --> 01:00:55.872]  It's a sickening, it makes me ashamed to be part of the human race when you see this sickening display of humanity.
[01:00:57.224 --> 01:00:59.266]  Basically making money off a tragedy.
[01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:01.367]  Well give us your review of the film.
[01:01:02.327 --> 01:01:07.330]  I didn't get to see the film because I was part of the security detail and I was outside most of the time.
[01:01:07.390 --> 01:01:17.617]  I just came in and out and basically my job was to you know they had us checking bags and all that nonsense and you know because they were afraid that the terrorists were going to get them you know.
[01:01:17.937 --> 01:01:18.797]  Oh they're everywhere.
[01:01:19.238 --> 01:01:19.978]  Oh they're horrible.
[01:01:20.018 --> 01:01:23.480]  They had us taking laptops and camera phones and recording devices.
[01:01:25.299 --> 01:01:26.700]  Absolutely, a lot of nonsense.
[01:01:27.721 --> 01:01:32.964]  And, you know, they had a bomb-sniffing dog come into the theater before, you know, the public came in.
[01:01:32.984 --> 01:01:34.485]  It was just disgusting.
[01:01:35.205 --> 01:01:44.251]  I mean, over here in New York we have, we had yesterday, the mayor had a conference with other mayors from other cities on gun control, which is another
[01:01:44.997 --> 01:01:48.719]  piece of nonsense that they're trying here in New York is complete, you can't have a gun at all.
[01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:53.502]  But he's a good conservative Republican Bloomberg is good.
[01:01:53.622 --> 01:01:57.204]  Yeah, a billionaire who has nothing in common with the common man.
[01:01:59.145 --> 01:02:03.207]  So, people in your security detail folks, you know, do they know the truth about 9-11?
[01:02:03.287 --> 01:02:05.028]  Some do, some don't.
[01:02:05.208 --> 01:02:10.051]  After 9-11, most of the veterans of the NYPD retired.
[01:02:12.152 --> 01:02:14.433]  They couldn't deal with it anymore, they just retired.
[01:02:15.004 --> 01:02:15.544]  Oh, really?
[01:02:15.604 --> 01:02:16.105]  Why?
[01:02:16.145 --> 01:02:17.346]  Because they knew what was going on?
[01:02:17.366 --> 01:02:18.246]  A lot of them, yeah.
[01:02:19.047 --> 01:02:19.287]  Yeah.
[01:02:20.748 --> 01:02:23.529]  So, it's just absolute nonsense.
[01:02:23.629 --> 01:02:25.451]  I woke up a little after 9-11.
[01:02:25.971 --> 01:02:26.671]  I was asleep.
[01:02:27.212 --> 01:02:29.293]  I didn't, you know, I agreed with this whole nonsense.
[01:02:29.813 --> 01:02:38.659]  And then, I had a friend introduce me to some books, videos, and I started waking up, and then I got introduced to your show, because I wanted more information.
[01:02:39.899 --> 01:02:42.101]  And, lo and behold, I'm awake.
[01:02:43.413 --> 01:02:50.317]  What is it like now for you to know the truth and to see the very people involved in the attacks grandstanding as our saviors?
[01:02:50.778 --> 01:02:51.798]  Oh, it's disgusting.
[01:02:51.838 --> 01:02:53.540]  It just makes me sick to my stomach.
[01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:54.600]  I mean, I've lost sleep.
[01:02:55.101 --> 01:02:57.662]  I've introduced another friend to your video.
[01:02:58.563 --> 01:02:58.783]  Yes.
[01:02:58.903 --> 01:03:04.046]  I subscribed to your website, Prison Planet TV.
[01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:04.747]  Yes, sir.
[01:03:04.847 --> 01:03:10.430]  And I showed him just two segments of 9-11 and he couldn't sleep for the whole night.
[01:03:11.091 --> 01:03:12.832]  Well, that's a normal response.
[01:03:13.963 --> 01:03:21.609]  I mean, it's normal when you realize that dangerous murdering criminals are running things, and then posing as the saviors at the same time.
[01:03:22.029 --> 01:03:23.090]  It's just too rich.
[01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:26.972]  Oh, it's just disgusting what it goes on.
[01:03:27.633 --> 01:03:32.316]  And a lot of people that I'm introducing slowly, I just can't take it.
[01:03:32.476 --> 01:03:33.497]  It's just too much.
[01:03:34.117 --> 01:03:36.059]  So they have to take your video in increments.
[01:03:37.529 --> 01:03:39.351]  Because it's just shocking to them.
[01:03:39.652 --> 01:03:41.093]  Well, Daniel, you're a great caller.
[01:03:41.153 --> 01:03:42.054]  Thanks for the info.
[01:03:42.074 --> 01:03:43.316]  Thanks for the inside scoop.
[01:03:43.356 --> 01:03:45.318]  It's great to know there are millions of people like you.
[01:03:45.338 --> 01:03:46.399]  You don't stand alone.
[01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:48.141]  That'll give you some solace.
[01:03:48.622 --> 01:03:51.045]  We'll come back and get into the news and take more calls.
[01:03:53.777 --> 01:04:00.641]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:04:00.941 --> 01:04:02.342]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:04:02.502 --> 01:04:04.703]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:04.863 --> 01:04:06.945]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:07.225 --> 01:04:12.187]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:12.508 --> 01:04:16.530]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:18.550]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:04:18.631 --> 01:04:29.273]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.413 --> 01:04:31.314]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:04:31.534 --> 01:04:35.395]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns in the info war.

[01:04:48.081 --> 01:04:55.868]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:04:56.188 --> 01:04:58.971]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:59.251 --> 01:05:03.395]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:03.835 --> 01:05:04.676]  So what do you do?
[01:05:04.977 --> 01:05:09.541]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:10.021 --> 01:05:12.142]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:12.642 --> 01:05:27.326]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[01:05:53.590 --> 01:05:54.411]  Come on, Bill.
[01:05:54.631 --> 01:05:59.814]  Two weeks ago you were riding a bicycle, and today you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[01:06:00.135 --> 01:06:01.635]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[01:06:01.736 --> 01:06:03.717]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[01:06:03.997 --> 01:06:09.520]  What I did do is visit the website www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:16.064]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[01:06:16.405 --> 01:06:18.606]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[01:06:18.906 --> 01:06:21.768]  And get this, they guaranteed my success in writing.
[01:06:22.268 --> 01:06:25.732]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week!
[01:06:25.952 --> 01:06:26.353]  Whoa!
[01:06:26.753 --> 01:06:27.954]  What was that website again?
[01:06:28.034 --> 01:06:31.518]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:06:31.838 --> 01:06:32.940]  Now write this down, John.
[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:37.364]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[01:06:37.524 --> 01:06:38.125]  Thanks, Bill.
[01:06:38.385 --> 01:06:39.587]  I'm going there right now.
[01:06:39.987 --> 01:06:40.628]  Check, please!
[01:06:42.411 --> 01:06:43.873]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[01:06:44.353 --> 01:06:44.953]  Sure, John.
[01:06:45.174 --> 01:06:49.517]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:06:49.837 --> 01:06:51.519]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[01:06:51.699 --> 01:06:52.039]  Deal.
[01:06:54.361 --> 01:06:56.543]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:57.123 --> 01:06:59.965]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:59.985 --> 01:07:09.533]  Alright, I told you in the last segment that I'm about to plunge in the news for 20-30 minutes, then we'll go back to your calls.
[01:07:10.561 --> 01:07:12.983]  Mike and Jerry and Eddie and Kim and many others.
[01:07:14.404 --> 01:07:17.227]  But right now, let's go to a caller who disagrees with me.
[01:07:17.667 --> 01:07:19.909]  People that disagree, go to the head of the line here.
[01:07:20.689 --> 01:07:22.731]  Let's talk to Mike in Colorado.
[01:07:22.791 --> 01:07:23.411]  Mike, go ahead.
[01:07:23.892 --> 01:07:24.372]  Hi, Alex.
[01:07:25.573 --> 01:07:38.744]  I'm calling about last Friday you had the head of the Border Watch folks... Yeah, Al Garza, National Director of the Minutemen.
[01:07:40.575 --> 01:07:42.996]  And their proposal to build a wall.
[01:07:44.096 --> 01:07:45.977]  And I have a real problem with that.
[01:07:48.297 --> 01:07:51.138]  You had a caller that called on Friday and disagreed.
[01:07:51.678 --> 01:07:52.679]  You argued with him quite a bit.
[01:07:53.979 --> 01:08:00.241]  Well, I just wonder, you know, how does a wall promote freedom?
[01:08:04.306 --> 01:08:05.427]  Well, let me make a comment.
[01:08:06.068 --> 01:08:07.229]  I guessed this before you came on.
[01:08:07.249 --> 01:08:11.192]  You're one of these radical, super-extreme, no-state libertarians.
[01:08:12.953 --> 01:08:13.874]  I am a libertarian.
[01:08:13.894 --> 01:08:21.460]  I wouldn't call myself quite the no-state libertarian, but... Yeah.
[01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:29.026]  I'm a constitutionalist, and I could sit here and explain this to you if you'd like me to, but I don't think that's going to change your view.
[01:08:31.621 --> 01:08:33.803]  Well, I think it's... Go ahead and make your points.
[01:08:33.823 --> 01:08:35.984]  I'll tell you what, you just go ahead and make your points.
[01:08:39.286 --> 01:08:40.908]  I think it's forgetting who the enemy is.
[01:08:41.508 --> 01:08:43.709]  The enemy is not with the poor Mexican people.
[01:08:43.770 --> 01:08:46.011]  We should be in allegiance with them against the global elite.
[01:08:46.271 --> 01:08:49.153]  But the enemy... And guys, I'm getting that echo.
[01:08:49.173 --> 01:08:50.834]  Will you adjust the board so that doesn't happen?
[01:08:51.075 --> 01:08:52.275]  That's happened ever since we moved the studio.
[01:08:56.016 --> 01:09:00.699]  The enemy, the New World Order, wants open borders, wants a Pan-American Union.
[01:09:01.019 --> 01:09:12.287]  The CFR openly states that they want to use the illegal aliens as a political bulldog to intimidate and to bring out of the shadows any time they want to control this country.
[01:09:12.647 --> 01:09:17.770]  They want to accelerate legal and illegal immigration, skilled and unskilled workers.
[01:09:18.691 --> 01:09:19.811]  It is not free market.
[01:09:20.152 --> 01:09:21.933]  They come from slave-based economies.
[01:09:23.454 --> 01:09:25.075]  So you talk about going after the enemy.
[01:09:25.195 --> 01:09:28.456]  The enemy, the New World Order, wants open borders, sir.
[01:09:31.637 --> 01:09:36.518]  Well, that they do, but they're also... So we shouldn't fight their policies and what they want?
[01:09:36.838 --> 01:09:50.042]  You wrote a great article with Steve Watson a few weeks ago about regarding the big immigration protests, that it was all promoted by the Spanish-speaking media and so forth.
[01:09:50.658 --> 01:09:53.360]  It was promoted by Bush's main PR firm.
[01:09:54.001 --> 01:09:58.745]  It was promoted and set up and run with the Sente Fox.
[01:09:58.785 --> 01:09:59.966]  The whole thing is staged.
[01:10:00.426 --> 01:10:00.646]  Right.
[01:10:01.207 --> 01:10:07.232]  And so they're looking to perhaps create a civil war in this country.
[01:10:07.272 --> 01:10:08.893]  They're looking to bully.
[01:10:09.486 --> 01:10:13.627]  The American people into shutting up and not demanding we control our borders.
[01:10:14.027 --> 01:10:25.951]  The PR firm admittedly was hired to stop the legislation, which they have stopped, from building a border fence and hiring more border patrol and arresting illegal aliens.
[01:10:28.965 --> 01:10:35.632]  You see, they're hiring lobbyists and running PR, long-term, Edward Bernays-style propaganda operations.
[01:10:35.692 --> 01:10:39.276]  We're countering them, saying no, no, no to all the things they want.
[01:10:40.778 --> 01:10:46.985]  Right, so how does, does NotThisWall instigate the Mexicans to think that
[01:10:47.685 --> 01:10:48.706]  Whitey is the enemy?
[01:10:48.906 --> 01:10:50.327]  They're already instigated, sir.
[01:10:50.367 --> 01:11:03.995]  Our government for 30 years and their government for 100 years plus has taught them that America is Mexico and all their problems are because of America and their population doubles every 35 years and you're not going to put the genie back in the bottle.
[01:11:04.035 --> 01:11:05.996]  You've got to face up to the crisis.
[01:11:07.337 --> 01:11:10.519]  So putting up a wall, does that not ensure that
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:15.503]  All the Mexicans, I understand they're not doing this at this point.
[01:11:15.663 --> 01:11:17.564]  No, we're going to fly them out and ship them out.
[01:11:18.324 --> 01:11:20.366]  And don't worry, we're not going to ship them all out of here.
[01:11:20.666 --> 01:11:23.447]  We're going to stop the hemorrhaging of three million a year.
[01:11:23.467 --> 01:11:32.513]  By crossing the official border instead of doing it illegally, now do they not need national ID cards?
[01:11:32.633 --> 01:11:35.294]  No, no, no, that's Bush's plan.
[01:11:36.515 --> 01:11:37.636]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:11:38.436 --> 01:11:39.937]  Let me try to explain this to you, sir.
[01:11:39.977 --> 01:11:40.918]  This is not my opinion.
[01:11:41.593 --> 01:11:42.333]  This is the facts.
[01:11:42.353 --> 01:11:44.174]  You know, you're totally confused.
[01:11:44.194 --> 01:11:45.514]  You're going in circles here.
[01:11:46.095 --> 01:11:47.695]  And we could do this all day long.
[01:11:50.076 --> 01:11:54.858]  President Bush wants the blanket amnesty and giving him the national ID card.
[01:11:54.918 --> 01:11:57.239]  And that's going on right now.
[01:11:59.379 --> 01:12:02.740]  There are 800 plus amnesty cities where they do not enforce the law.
[01:12:03.101 --> 01:12:05.882]  And where the cities accept any fake ID they bring forward.
[01:12:06.442 --> 01:12:07.922]  Something they don't accept from citizens.
[01:12:09.503 --> 01:12:09.783]  Okay?
[01:12:12.475 --> 01:12:26.101]  I mean, it's almost even pointless to even try to sit here and explain this to the radical libertarian lobby, who doesn't even know what public-private partnership is, that doesn't even know that corporations have become government.
[01:12:27.441 --> 01:12:34.064]  That they didn't just hand everything over to the corporations when they are operating as governmental, piratical institutions.
[01:12:36.465 --> 01:12:38.626]  I mean, you gave me a headache, but that's okay.
[01:12:39.272 --> 01:12:43.814]  I think you're a reasonable caller with reasonable questions and reasonable points you're making.
[01:12:43.934 --> 01:12:50.237]  It's just that I could talk about nothing but immigration and never even explain it fully.
[01:12:53.599 --> 01:12:53.899]  Okay?
[01:12:55.340 --> 01:13:06.185]  The New World Order wants to destroy national sovereignty and set up a world government with world laws, world regulation, world taxation, world police, and world military.
[01:13:06.305 --> 01:13:06.865]  That's stated.
[01:13:09.494 --> 01:13:32.369]  Their plan is not free market, it is to leverage, using governmental power, all of their competition out of existence, whether it be governments or other companies, and to vest all power and regulatory control and physical prowess and physical enforcement in their hands, in the hands of only about 20 corporations or less, and a few families.
[01:13:34.131 --> 01:13:35.351]  It's world empire.
[01:13:35.872 --> 01:13:37.633]  It's neo-colonialism.
[01:13:39.127 --> 01:13:39.588]  Period.
[01:13:41.574 --> 01:13:44.944]  And they have taken the Latin American populations...
[01:13:46.394 --> 01:13:55.582]  And our government has done abusive things to Latin America in the past, so there is an innate anger towards America there, but not towards the elite, towards America itself.
[01:13:56.242 --> 01:14:07.352]  Our elites, with their PR firms and their 180 IQ eggheads, came up with a false liberation theology of, okay, go into America, bring America down.
[01:14:07.712 --> 01:14:08.733]  This is Mexico.
[01:14:08.773 --> 01:14:09.733]  La Reconquista.
[01:14:09.774 --> 01:14:11.015]  You have a right to be here.
[01:14:11.295 --> 01:14:12.596]  You have a right to welfare.
[01:14:14.651 --> 01:14:31.394]  Then these people come in, and they're not sophisticated enough, just like the American people, to understand that they're financed and controlled, and that Bush, known Bush PR firms are running the entire operation, that known Bush, globalist-controlled PR firms, the same PR firm, got Vicente Fox elected.
[01:14:32.455 --> 01:14:33.335]  That's all admitted!
[01:14:35.135 --> 01:14:37.056]  Dallas Morning News, we wrote a big article about it.
[01:14:39.036 --> 01:14:40.976]  That was all in the Dallas Morning News back in December.
[01:14:41.056 --> 01:14:43.497]  They were bragging about it, what, December 25th, Dallas Morning News?
[01:14:45.091 --> 01:14:53.738]  And you go up and you tell these La Rican Kistas, hey, you're controlled by the globalists, this whole thing stays, they'll laugh at you and go, no, we're taking over, you're just scared.
[01:14:54.159 --> 01:15:00.304]  It's a primitive, tribal, like the Nazis, we're taking over.
[01:15:00.704 --> 01:15:07.309]  And it feels so good, because most of these people are economically in the lower strata, and so it's a pride thing.
[01:15:07.890 --> 01:15:09.311]  It's a macho thing.
[01:15:12.811 --> 01:15:17.255]  And the Libertarians run around saying, hey we gotta have open borders, that's freedom, freedom of movement.
[01:15:17.516 --> 01:15:20.458]  We don't need a Berlin Wall to keep the American people in.
[01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:25.223]  Did you know that if you try, there already is a Berlin Wall.
[01:15:25.243 --> 01:15:33.771]  Did you know that if you try to go across the Mexican border in almost every case, what is it, 90 plus percent of the time, you are apprehended, you are beat up, your car is stolen.
[01:15:34.665 --> 01:15:47.294]  Your money is stolen and they actually have officers in every jail, they contact your family, they run a credit check, and they say we will have $100,000 or your son or daughter or your husband will spend six months to five years in our prison.
[01:15:53.398 --> 01:15:55.059]  So there's already a wall down there.
[01:15:55.219 --> 01:15:58.221]  Our Border Patrol will catch you in most cases if you try to go across.
[01:15:58.981 --> 01:16:02.764]  It is by design that they are to let the third world populations in.
[01:16:05.879 --> 01:16:09.581]  And so people say, hey, they're trying to get us stirred up and fighting with each other.
[01:16:11.462 --> 01:16:12.842]  The government's manipulating us.
[01:16:12.882 --> 01:16:17.044]  We need to be friends with all the illegal aliens, and we need to join with them.
[01:16:18.085 --> 01:16:22.287]  Yes, we do need to deprogram the illegal aliens that are here to wake up to what's happening.
[01:16:24.087 --> 01:16:30.130]  We do need to deprogram the people that are now citizens, but support the invaders and the lowly conquistas, the reconquerors.
[01:16:30.150 --> 01:16:31.811]  That's what a lowly conquista is.
[01:16:34.850 --> 01:16:48.540]  But we have to realize that immediately in their daily lives, thinking about paycheck to paycheck, most illegal aliens are on welfare, on top of working multiple jobs, and they're making a lot more money than they would in Mexico, so they're not going to listen and they're not going to care.
[01:16:51.222 --> 01:16:56.966]  Okay, there's really more than 30 million, but conservatively 20 to 25 million is the official numbers.
[01:17:00.329 --> 01:17:03.131]  And Bush and others and the Democrats want unlimited.
[01:17:04.358 --> 01:17:13.722]  And I've got to have arguments with neocon listeners who are so dumbed down they believe Sean Hannity and Limbaugh when they tell them, we've got to get behind Bush's plan, it'll really deal with the illegal alien problem.
[01:17:14.002 --> 01:17:15.102]  Yeah, it'll make them all legal.
[01:17:15.382 --> 01:17:27.687]  For six years, anyone who's here or gets here is instantly given a work visa, instantly signed up for welfare, to have their children, food stamps, tuition, public schooling, everything.
[01:17:29.105 --> 01:17:34.187]  And it allows corporations to bring in unlimited skilled visas and unskilled visas.
[01:17:34.467 --> 01:17:36.968]  To have buses coming across the border every day unlimited.
[01:17:37.268 --> 01:17:43.111]  So you're right, it will fix the problem of the coyotes and the people coming across and the smuggling.
[01:17:43.151 --> 01:17:45.612]  That will drop off massively because you won't need to.
[01:17:46.772 --> 01:17:50.914]  The official plan is highways from Alaska to Chile.
[01:17:52.675 --> 01:17:56.376]  Already being constructed from Minneapolis-St.
[01:17:56.416 --> 01:17:57.417]  Paul to Mexico City.
[01:17:57.537 --> 01:17:57.977]  Already built.
[01:18:00.552 --> 01:18:01.333]  Totally legal.
[01:18:01.433 --> 01:18:02.173]  End of America.
[01:18:02.233 --> 01:18:03.094]  Pan-American Union.
[01:18:03.254 --> 01:18:07.817]  They had official summits four years ago, three years ago, two years ago, and then down in Cancun.
[01:18:07.857 --> 01:18:10.698]  They openly announced the Pan-American Union.
[01:18:10.778 --> 01:18:11.719]  That's what this is.
[01:18:11.979 --> 01:18:13.500]  The same stuff's going on in Europe!
[01:18:16.922 --> 01:18:26.428]  And then they bring in 10 million Turks into Germany, and then they say, OK, now they're going to run things and you're not allowed to kick them out, and they're going to go protest and they're going to vote.
[01:18:26.868 --> 01:18:27.849]  And then we're going to leverage you.
[01:18:29.821 --> 01:18:31.141]  It's the same thing.
[01:18:31.962 --> 01:18:32.322]  Okay?
[01:18:32.902 --> 01:18:38.143]  They're bringing in foreign hordes that their PR machine totally controls to bully us.
[01:18:38.603 --> 01:18:41.084]  The government can snap its fingers and every U.S.
[01:18:41.124 --> 01:18:42.864]  city will burn to the ground.
[01:18:42.884 --> 01:18:43.685]  And they're going to do it.
[01:18:44.505 --> 01:18:45.865]  That may be the next 9-11.
[01:18:46.005 --> 01:18:47.826]  And they're going to take your rights, Americans.
[01:18:48.786 --> 01:18:50.446]  Black, white, Hispanic, it doesn't matter.
[01:18:50.646 --> 01:18:53.287]  The illegal aliens are going to get off scot-free, so get ready.
[01:18:56.050 --> 01:18:57.691]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:58.291 --> 01:19:00.113]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:01.214 --> 01:19:09.120]  The best-kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:11.962]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Inc.'
[01:19:11.942 --> 01:19:13.363]  's patented methodology.

[01:19:55.362 --> 01:19:56.404]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:19:56.804 --> 01:20:02.311]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:20:02.872 --> 01:20:03.373]  That's right.
[01:20:03.693 --> 01:20:05.976]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:20:07.378 --> 01:20:13.466]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:20:14.002 --> 01:20:21.706]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:20:22.146 --> 01:20:26.949]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:20:27.612 --> 01:20:32.637]  If you'd like to take a look at gold pre-retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:33.437 --> 01:20:37.561]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:20:37.941 --> 01:20:38.182]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:38.202 --> 01:20:40.143]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:20:40.223 --> 01:20:40.524]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:40.824 --> 01:20:41.104]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:54.727 --> 01:20:59.230]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:20:59.571 --> 01:21:03.674]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:21:03.954 --> 01:21:04.514]  We listened.
[01:21:04.814 --> 01:21:09.798]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:21:10.078 --> 01:21:10.559]  We listened.
[01:21:10.939 --> 01:21:13.981]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:21:14.401 --> 01:21:14.942]  We listened.
[01:21:15.402 --> 01:21:19.465]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:21:19.845 --> 01:21:20.326]  We listened.
[01:21:20.666 --> 01:21:25.910]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:21:26.330 --> 01:21:27.691]  Again, we listened.
[01:21:28.051 --> 01:21:35.437]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:21:35.817 --> 01:21:39.280]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling
[01:21:45.032 --> 01:21:48.693]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:22:07.432 --> 01:22:07.732]  We're good.
[01:22:32.073 --> 01:22:32.533]  I think so.
[01:22:58.465 --> 01:23:00.227]  It's simple with the border issue.
[01:23:00.867 --> 01:23:19.684]  There is a carefully packaged and crafted plan to openly butcher our national sovereignty and bring in unlimited hordes of third world nationals who hate America and openly are calling for this nation to be brought down.
[01:23:20.419 --> 01:23:21.240]  I mean, I'm not kidding.
[01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:34.297]  The majority of the radical Chicano leaders run the gamut from the less extreme, saying pilgrims just need to all leave, and we're going to have a racial Chicano state, to all whites must be killed.
[01:23:35.245 --> 01:23:43.787]  Now, and a large portion, I'd say, I don't know, 30-40% of the Chicano leaders say that all white males, 16 and older, must die.
[01:23:44.088 --> 01:23:47.489]  To the extreme on that side, to all whites must die.
[01:23:47.849 --> 01:23:49.609]  And the media carefully covers that up.
[01:23:50.049 --> 01:23:52.970]  You can go to UT and read their speeches, or it'll be in periodicals.
[01:23:52.990 --> 01:23:56.751]  I mean, this is all Twilight Zone.
[01:23:56.891 --> 01:23:59.792]  DynCorp kidnapping children openly, Chicago Tribune.
[01:23:59.812 --> 01:24:03.153]  Illegal aliens running around saying, kill Whitey.
[01:24:04.119 --> 01:24:07.121]  And we're just supposed to sit here and take it?
[01:24:09.522 --> 01:24:10.282]  I mean, come on!
[01:24:11.743 --> 01:24:13.144]  And then spin it in our brain?
[01:24:13.384 --> 01:24:15.865]  Oh, maybe they just want us fighting with each other.
[01:24:15.905 --> 01:24:16.625]  Of course they do!
[01:24:16.645 --> 01:24:18.286]  That's why they want to bring in unlimited numbers!
[01:24:19.046 --> 01:24:20.527]  You've got to stop their programs.
[01:24:20.547 --> 01:24:22.408]  You've got to fight them every step of the way.
[01:24:22.668 --> 01:24:23.789]  This is how it works, too.
[01:24:24.029 --> 01:24:25.029]  And this is important.
[01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:26.530]  Here's a headline, just out.
[01:24:26.670 --> 01:24:29.212]  Senate shifts Iraq funds to Border Patrol.
[01:24:30.112 --> 01:24:32.013]  Bush then threatens to veto.
[01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:35.443]  Bush has not vetoed a single bill.
[01:24:35.884 --> 01:24:39.150]  Bush says he'll sign a $95 billion defense bill, supplemental bill.
[01:24:40.055 --> 01:24:45.077]  But they want another $11.5 billion to $106.5 billion from $95 billion.
[01:24:45.117 --> 01:24:47.018]  So that's $11.5 billion increase.
[01:24:47.638 --> 01:24:50.239]  And to put a few billion of that into Border Patrol funding.
[01:24:50.259 --> 01:24:51.079]  But who's proposing it?
[01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:53.200]  Hillary Clinton and Chuckie Schumer.
[01:24:53.300 --> 01:24:54.081]  What's their plan?
[01:24:54.421 --> 01:24:55.201]  Biometrics.
[01:24:55.281 --> 01:24:56.982]  It just funds the National ID Card.
[01:24:57.262 --> 01:24:59.042]  Then Bush will capitulate and agree.
[01:24:59.403 --> 01:25:01.303]  It doesn't really do anything to stop illegals.
[01:25:01.383 --> 01:25:02.524]  It fools everyone.
[01:25:02.944 --> 01:25:05.505]  You see, they're masters at giving you false choices.
[01:25:05.885 --> 01:25:08.127]  They'll give you a Democratic plan and a Bush plan.
[01:25:08.487 --> 01:25:10.549]  We'll have a thick debate about those two plans.
[01:25:10.990 --> 01:25:12.631]  And those two plans do the same thing.
[01:25:15.694 --> 01:25:16.014]  Simple.
[01:25:18.957 --> 01:25:20.939]  Take the 1,200 people arrested.
[01:25:21.779 --> 01:25:25.082]  We did the numbers of 1,000 arrested today because that's what they first announced last week.
[01:25:26.364 --> 01:25:26.664]  That is .00004.
[01:25:26.764 --> 01:25:27.204]  Do the math.
[01:25:32.842 --> 01:25:39.166]  Those 1,000 people arrested, and they said 1,000 illegals and about 200 employers and other employees.
[01:25:40.547 --> 01:25:42.488]  So 1,200, but about 1,000 of them were illegal.
[01:25:43.068 --> 01:25:51.233]  So I guess the original number when they said 1,000 illegals arrested, then they just added on the 200 employers and managers.
[01:25:51.593 --> 01:25:53.034]  365 days in a year.
[01:25:53.194 --> 01:25:55.655]  That's how long it takes the planet to orbit the sun.
[01:25:56.055 --> 01:25:56.896]  That's a standard year.
[01:25:58.952 --> 01:25:59.852]  This is an important point.
[01:25:59.872 --> 01:26:02.213]  I've got to write an article about this because I just keep having to repeat it.
[01:26:03.374 --> 01:26:14.118]  If they arrested 1,000 illegal aliens for an entire year, that is not even 1% of the illegal aliens.
[01:26:14.338 --> 01:26:20.041]  If they had arrests every single day of 1,000, that is less than 1% out of 100.
[01:26:20.081 --> 01:26:21.021]  Do you realize the magnitude
[01:26:27.174 --> 01:26:32.136]  And three million pouring in a year.
[01:26:32.156 --> 01:26:36.378]  365 times a thousand is 365,000 people.
[01:26:36.718 --> 01:26:40.399]  And there's three million new illegal aliens pouring in each year.
[01:26:40.419 --> 01:26:41.460]  That's the government's own numbers.
[01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:44.941]  Now about a million of those they say go back each year.
[01:26:45.281 --> 01:26:46.422]  So let's say it's two million.
[01:26:47.082 --> 01:26:50.503]  So if we arrested a thousand a day, that would be 365,000 out of a million
[01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:53.780]  With what?
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:54.681]  $650,000 plus a million.
[01:26:54.761 --> 01:26:57.342]  So $1,650,000 new illegals every year on top of the conservative $25,000,000 that are here.
[01:26:57.362 --> 01:26:57.763]  So it'll be $26,500,000, $27,500,000.
[01:26:58.163 --> 01:26:58.363]  No, no.
[01:26:58.383 --> 01:26:58.743]  $26,500,000 then $28,000,000 then
[01:27:23.201 --> 01:27:44.045]  29,500,000 31,000,000 on and on and on and on and this amnesty plan that they call a reform and the liberals are all lying on the radio and TV, the conservatives are all lying, they're not really conservatives and people don't have time to analyze it.
[01:27:44.365 --> 01:27:45.946]  That's what I do for a living.
[01:27:46.026 --> 01:27:47.386]  I interview all the border experts.
[01:27:47.426 --> 01:27:49.826]  I interview Tom Tancredo, Ron Paul.
[01:27:50.547 --> 01:27:52.627]  I have the Liberty Conquistas on occasionally.
[01:27:54.031 --> 01:27:55.311]  This is what we do.
[01:27:57.972 --> 01:28:00.452]  And believe me, we're in deep trouble, but you can do the math.
[01:28:02.393 --> 01:28:03.253]  You're not stupid.
[01:28:05.113 --> 01:28:09.354]  That's why 80 plus percent of you in major polls want the borders controlled, and those numbers are only growing.
[01:28:12.875 --> 01:28:13.895]  So what does the government do?
[01:28:13.955 --> 01:28:15.855]  They got 25 million illegal aliens?
[01:28:16.835 --> 01:28:20.556]  A 25 million man army to bully us and shove us around?
[01:28:22.392 --> 01:28:29.614]  All right, I'll come back and get into the other news, but the border situation is important, so I covered it, and I'm glad the caller called in disagreeing with me.
[01:28:29.814 --> 01:28:30.935]  Disagreeing with what?
[01:28:32.195 --> 01:28:37.217]  No one can deny that there's a takeover taking place, and it isn't the poor, pathetic, illegal aliens that are doing it.
[01:28:37.617 --> 01:28:39.177]  They're just tools.
[01:28:39.877 --> 01:28:40.478]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:40.518 --> 01:28:40.958]  Stay with us.
[01:28:44.219 --> 01:28:45.139]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.599 --> 01:28:47.200]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:50.821]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.372 --> 01:29:01.235]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[01:29:01.395 --> 01:29:14.301]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest-growing business opportunity in America today.
[01:29:14.501 --> 01:29:16.282]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[01:29:16.462 --> 01:29:19.923]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[01:29:20.203 --> 01:29:23.984]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[01:29:24.244 --> 01:29:29.205]  Whatever it is you seek, Zango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[01:29:29.465 --> 01:29:31.166]  So take matters into your own hands.

[01:30:47.014 --> 01:30:50.615]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:30:58.678 --> 01:31:02.063]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:31:02.263 --> 01:31:05.668]  Here's Dr. Matson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:31:05.996 --> 01:31:09.238]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:31:09.258 --> 01:31:14.722]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we've seen.
[01:31:14.762 --> 01:31:24.408]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:31:24.528 --> 01:31:25.869]  It's a well thought out formula.
[01:31:25.909 --> 01:31:31.313]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[01:31:31.796 --> 01:31:36.241]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:31:36.261 --> 01:31:37.682]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:31:37.862 --> 01:31:41.886]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.

[01:32:11.972 --> 01:32:13.012]  It's a world government!
[01:32:15.173 --> 01:32:16.994]  They're taking over every institution.
[01:32:17.234 --> 01:32:19.954]  They're removing even the government's power over our nation.
[01:32:20.515 --> 01:32:21.815]  Because it's going to the globalists.
[01:32:23.776 --> 01:32:28.077]  That's the number one thing people need to get through their heads and then look at the world through that lens.
[01:32:29.117 --> 01:32:30.858]  Let's get into the news, the other news right now.
[01:32:32.248 --> 01:32:36.310]  Majority in Army Times poll think Rumsfeld should resign.
[01:32:37.731 --> 01:32:43.594]  According to a poll at Army Times, a majority of respondents believe that Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld should resign.
[01:32:44.875 --> 01:32:54.200]  At the time of this writing, 2,985 readers have voted in the latest Army Times poll, with 63.28% agreeing that the U.S.
[01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:58.603]  war effort is grounds for Secretary Rumsfeld to resign.
[01:33:01.108 --> 01:33:15.194]  33.37% voted that they had no opinion, and 9.04% said that they support Rumsfeld.
[01:33:15.894 --> 01:33:24.117]  So most people say he should leave, then the large portion, 33 plus percent, said that they had no opinion.
[01:33:25.598 --> 01:33:25.998]  Excuse me.
[01:33:28.182 --> 01:33:31.345]  996 or 33.37% voted no.
[01:33:31.365 --> 01:33:33.906]  100 people voted that they had no opinion.
[01:33:36.408 --> 01:33:37.809]  But it's a baseless debate.
[01:33:37.889 --> 01:33:38.950]  Rumsfeld's a puppet.
[01:33:39.010 --> 01:33:39.891]  Bush is a puppet.
[01:33:39.931 --> 01:33:40.851]  It doesn't even matter.
[01:33:40.891 --> 01:33:43.093]  They're carrying out what the New World Order wants.
[01:33:43.753 --> 01:33:45.234]  And then Bush will take all the blame.
[01:33:45.915 --> 01:33:47.236]  Someday he'll leave office.
[01:33:47.676 --> 01:33:54.481]  And then the ball just gets carried by Hillary or Governor Warner or Jeb or whoever it is.
[01:33:56.582 --> 01:33:58.944]  Vermont lawmakers to call for Bush impeachment.
[01:33:58.964 --> 01:34:00.245]  This is out of the Vermont Guardian.
[01:34:00.905 --> 01:34:08.570]  A progressive lawmaker today will introduce a formal resolution in the state legislature calling on Congress to draft articles of impeachment against President George W. Bush.
[01:34:09.491 --> 01:34:11.472]  So now the live free or die state.
[01:34:11.512 --> 01:34:12.633]  New Hampshire's done this.
[01:34:14.134 --> 01:34:15.034]  Hawaii has.
[01:34:15.094 --> 01:34:17.096]  California is moving forward to do that.
[01:34:18.937 --> 01:34:20.058]  Meanwhile they had a big poll.
[01:34:20.931 --> 01:34:26.534]  Where they ask American people if they like the spying and the different things Bush is doing and 90% said no.
[01:34:28.655 --> 01:34:30.775]  Scary article here out of the Associated Press.
[01:34:30.876 --> 01:34:34.157]  Missing bioterror substances have officials guessing.
[01:34:35.618 --> 01:34:42.681]  In the past year, two New Jersey laboratories have been unable to account for plague-infested mice and vials of deadly anthrax spores.
[01:34:43.849 --> 01:34:49.456]  And top state officials are scrambling to devise better ways to safeguard deadly material.
[01:34:49.977 --> 01:35:00.251]  In both cases, authorities say they think the items in question weren't actually lost but were simply unaccounted for due to clinical clerical errors.
[01:35:01.733 --> 01:35:01.893]  Now,
[01:35:04.068 --> 01:35:05.389]  We know that the U.S.
[01:35:05.429 --> 01:35:10.051]  government, elements of it, launched the original anthrax attack and the evidence of that is voluminous.
[01:35:10.111 --> 01:35:16.294]  Bush and his cabinet on Cipro, September 10th, three and a half weeks before it popped up first in Boca Raton, Florida at American Media.
[01:35:17.794 --> 01:35:21.076]  They then said it was some bathtub anthrax anybody could make.
[01:35:21.856 --> 01:35:25.418]  Turns out, of course, it was the most weaponized ever seen patented U.S.
[01:35:25.458 --> 01:35:32.661]  slash British version from Fort Detrick, Maryland, coated in bentonite, which is a hundred million dollar plus project equipment to do that.
[01:35:33.502 --> 01:35:45.605]  So just remember that, never forget that, and remember that enemies of the New World Order all got mailed the anthrax and it was used to steamroll through what happened with the Patriot Act.
[01:35:46.966 --> 01:35:48.686]  Here's another article out of the Associated Press.
[01:35:48.706 --> 01:35:57.088]  Remember the graphic video of the little black boy being stomped to death by guards at one of these camps, boot camps?
[01:35:57.629 --> 01:35:59.149]  They had other deaths at the same camp.
[01:35:59.818 --> 01:36:00.799]  This video got out.
[01:36:00.839 --> 01:36:03.621]  The local coroner ruled that he had a blood disorder and that's why he died.
[01:36:04.122 --> 01:36:12.069]  They had another medical examiner look at it and said clearly he died from wounds sustained during the throttling, during the beating.
[01:36:13.230 --> 01:36:26.381]  And if I could only tell you the wonderful Hollywood person that funded their lawyers and funded the research, but I can't tell you because that person doesn't want you to know how caring they were months and months ago to do this.
[01:36:29.266 --> 01:36:34.388]  That person being savage right now and being libeled and being lied about.
[01:36:39.209 --> 01:36:45.451]  Continuing, Bush, Congress report progress on immigration reform bill.
[01:36:47.475 --> 01:36:52.278]  And Bush, and we mentioned this earlier, but this is another article, President George W. Bush hailed progress made with members of the U.S.
[01:36:52.298 --> 01:37:01.985]  Senate towards an overhaul of American immigration laws and said there were broad areas of agreement on the compromise bill, but he said he will veto it unless they cut out the money to deal with the border.
[01:37:02.565 --> 01:37:05.267]  And then, again, even that bill is a whitewash itself.
[01:37:06.467 --> 01:37:10.070]  Speaking of illegal immigration, continuing, Knight Ritter newspapers
[01:37:12.103 --> 01:37:17.726]  Data on illegal immigrants kept secret to agency site privacy and denying info to prosecutors.
[01:37:19.367 --> 01:37:28.471]  We know that almost every industry is dominated by illegal aliens because it's admitted they will run you off of a meatpacking line.
[01:37:29.012 --> 01:37:32.994]  If you're a Mexican-American who won't speak Spanish, that's open.
[01:37:33.394 --> 01:37:41.358]  If you're Asian, if you're white, if you're black, the janitorial jobs, the meatpacking jobs, the grocery store jobs, the highway worker jobs, the construction jobs,
[01:37:42.068 --> 01:37:46.171]  The farming jobs, now the car dealer jobs, everything.
[01:37:48.193 --> 01:37:49.454]  Imagine that solidarity.
[01:37:49.494 --> 01:37:54.638]  Imagine if the hundred and something million whites in this country just said, we're not going to deal with anybody but whites.
[01:37:55.299 --> 01:37:56.600]  They'd call that segregation.
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:37:57.781]  They'd call that discrimination.
[01:37:58.041 --> 01:38:02.004]  It's wrong when whites do it, and it's wrong when the low-income keisters do it.
[01:38:03.185 --> 01:38:09.831]  And the federal agencies are refusing to turn it over to ICE and others, the new so-called
[01:38:11.227 --> 01:38:12.287]  Border Control Agency.
[01:38:14.028 --> 01:38:14.828]  And nothing's going to happen.
[01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:21.811]  And that dovetails with this story today out of Reuters.
[01:38:23.952 --> 01:38:26.933]  Seaboard port plant to close for immigration rally.
[01:38:27.073 --> 01:38:32.155]  This is written with classical psychological warfare because you read later and it says a whole bunch of other plants are closing.
[01:38:33.445 --> 01:38:36.807]  And the plants are closing, even though their employees were still going to come into work.
[01:38:36.827 --> 01:38:37.807]  They're saying, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:38:38.288 --> 01:38:39.428]  You don't need to come into work.
[01:38:39.508 --> 01:38:41.209]  We support your immigrant rights.
[01:38:41.289 --> 01:38:46.732]  Of course, guaranteed, most of these people are illegal aliens, using fake or duplicate social security numbers.
[01:38:48.233 --> 01:38:53.676]  I mean, they'll let employees come in and say, 50 of them might have the same, you know, out of hundreds of employees.
[01:38:53.696 --> 01:38:54.876]  This is in the news, right here in front of me.
[01:38:55.897 --> 01:38:58.138]  A huge majority may have the same social security number.
[01:38:58.518 --> 01:39:00.039]  Fake names, none of it even matters.
[01:39:01.107 --> 01:39:01.707]  It doesn't matter.
[01:39:01.747 --> 01:39:02.547]  It's not enforced.
[01:39:02.928 --> 01:39:10.810]  And once a year, they'll go arrest a thousand people, .00004, and oh my gosh, they're really cracking down.
[01:39:11.790 --> 01:39:14.331]  And that makes all the good old boys think everything's okay.
[01:39:14.351 --> 01:39:14.851]  Listen to this.
[01:39:15.051 --> 01:39:15.611]  Chicago.
[01:39:16.912 --> 01:39:28.455]  Seaboard Corporation said it will close its Guyman, Oklahoma port plan on Monday to allow workers to attend rallies planned for that day in support of immigration reform, the company said.
[01:39:29.108 --> 01:39:34.452]  A plant has a daily hog slaughter capacity of 16,000 hogs, the company said.
[01:39:35.353 --> 01:39:37.014]  On Tuesday, Cargill Inc.
[01:39:37.174 --> 01:39:41.477]  said its five beef plants and two hog plants will be closed on Monday for the rallies as well.
[01:39:44.420 --> 01:39:46.401]  I bet if you research they're getting paid leave.
[01:39:46.421 --> 01:39:50.124]  Because Cargill and others are involved in the lobbying to have open borders.
[01:39:52.326 --> 01:39:56.609]  And ICE could go there right now,
[01:39:57.666 --> 01:40:00.047]  And demand to see social security numbers and arrest.
[01:40:00.787 --> 01:40:05.629]  I'd imagine it's probably about 80% from other arrests we've seen will be totally illegal.
[01:40:06.450 --> 01:40:09.691]  And then the others will have green cards that have expired.
[01:40:10.291 --> 01:40:12.552]  You might have 5% of people in there that are legal.
[01:40:12.832 --> 01:40:17.554]  It'll be a few white guys at the lowest level and a few black guys being ordered around.
[01:40:17.574 --> 01:40:19.015]  I mean, and that's how it works now.
[01:40:19.935 --> 01:40:24.877]  They'll be scrabbling around with their heads leaned over taking orders, you know, running around being bossed around.
[01:40:24.897 --> 01:40:27.178]  I mean, that's how it is.
[01:40:29.784 --> 01:40:32.706]  And then pretty soon they're just told, hey you don't speak Spanish, you're off the line.
[01:40:34.188 --> 01:40:37.170]  Doesn't matter if you're a chef, doesn't matter if you work in a slaughterhouse.
[01:40:38.671 --> 01:40:39.372]  It doesn't matter.
[01:40:42.714 --> 01:40:44.095]  At every level this is going on.
[01:40:47.298 --> 01:40:53.483]  And so we have a Bush PR firm that got him elected openly, got Fox elected out of Dallas.
[01:40:55.603 --> 01:41:04.410]  Working with the Spanish and English-speaking media to stage these protests, put them in a good light, for months and months, telling the people to protest and mobilize.
[01:41:06.011 --> 01:41:09.113]  You have the plants where these people work telling them, go ahead and take the day off.
[01:41:09.654 --> 01:41:10.535]  We support you.
[01:41:11.876 --> 01:41:20.242]  Again, the establishment, the elite, Cargill, that in between Cargill and Tyson run almost all the meatpacking in this country.
[01:41:22.901 --> 01:41:23.882]  They call them meatpacking.
[01:41:23.902 --> 01:41:25.823]  They're called slaughterhouses, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:29.266 --> 01:41:30.226]  And so that's what's going on.
[01:41:32.368 --> 01:41:33.409]  And again, it's only going to get worse.
[01:41:35.811 --> 01:41:43.416]  It's the corporations and the government and the big money teamed up with 25 million out-of-control illegal aliens saying this is their country.
[01:41:44.197 --> 01:41:45.898]  And the globalists absolutely love it.
[01:41:46.917 --> 01:41:47.917]  Here's another one out of England.
[01:41:48.257 --> 01:41:50.518]  This dovetails with the United States, the exact same thing.
[01:41:51.078 --> 01:42:06.482]  In fact, there was a Houston Chronicle article last year that said 350,000, that was the headline, violent offenders released out of Texas state and local facilities alone in 2004.
[01:42:06.962 --> 01:42:07.923]  And that was reported in 2005.
[01:42:08.003 --> 01:42:09.603]  Houston Chronicle.
[01:42:14.033 --> 01:42:15.793]  So this is nothing on the London Telegraph.
[01:42:16.214 --> 01:42:19.214]  Hunt for 900 dangerous criminals freed in error.
[01:42:19.834 --> 01:42:20.014]  Huh!
[01:42:20.215 --> 01:42:21.595]  They don't call it an error here.
[01:42:22.955 --> 01:42:25.056]  More than 1,000 convicted foreign criminals.
[01:42:26.256 --> 01:42:29.777]  Did you notice that first it's 900, now it's... the next line is over 1,000.
[01:42:30.657 --> 01:42:40.699]  More than 1,000 convicted foreign criminals, including killers, rapists, and child abusers, have been freed from prison without being considered for deportation, and hundreds are missing.
[01:42:40.979 --> 01:42:43.040]  Charles Clark, the Home Secretary, admitted yesterday.
[01:42:43.942 --> 01:42:46.583]  And of course, Blair signed a secret deal last year to bring in Unlimited.
[01:42:48.943 --> 01:42:57.006]  All the prisoners had committed crimes that should have triggered automatic assessment for removal from the country and the majority should have expected to be expelled.
[01:42:59.366 --> 01:43:05.948]  And it just goes on to say 1,023 prisoners released and it just goes through the crimes.
[01:43:06.508 --> 01:43:06.688]  Huh!
[01:43:08.549 --> 01:43:11.450]  Hey, that's better than 300 and something thousand.
[01:43:11.470 --> 01:43:11.590]  Was it 350?
[01:43:13.499 --> 01:43:17.220]  Going from memory, my memory is fluctuating between 350 and 450.
[01:43:17.340 --> 01:43:20.321]  I remember I was shocked by the number.
[01:43:22.722 --> 01:43:24.463]  I mean, these people are gods.
[01:43:24.803 --> 01:43:26.543]  They are literal gods.
[01:43:27.244 --> 01:43:33.486]  The police stop them, don't arrest them, no insurance, hit and runs, murders, rapes, crime.
[01:43:33.886 --> 01:43:36.046]  They feed on their own people in their own neighborhoods.
[01:43:36.327 --> 01:43:37.427]  They're unstoppable.
[01:43:37.827 --> 01:43:39.107]  No one does anything to them.
[01:43:39.167 --> 01:43:40.508]  If they're arrested, they're released.
[01:43:42.447 --> 01:43:44.449]  Serial killers killing dozens of times.
[01:43:44.489 --> 01:43:45.169]  Don't get in trouble.
[01:43:45.229 --> 01:43:46.050]  It's been in the news.
[01:43:47.971 --> 01:43:54.176]  I live in a state that witnessed 800 plus deaths on our side of the border and their side, on the Texas border.
[01:43:54.796 --> 01:43:56.057]  Car bombings in Dallas.
[01:43:56.297 --> 01:43:57.518]  Rocket attacks on U.S.
[01:43:57.578 --> 01:43:58.038]  embassies.
[01:43:59.099 --> 01:44:02.081]  State Department travel advisories more dangerous than the West Bank.
[01:44:03.222 --> 01:44:04.203]  Murders in Austin.
[01:44:04.723 --> 01:44:06.124]  Murders in San Antonio.
[01:44:06.725 --> 01:44:07.365]  Military.
[01:44:07.445 --> 01:44:08.306]  Los Zetas.
[01:44:08.946 --> 01:44:09.767]  Commandos.
[01:44:09.967 --> 01:44:11.368]  Murdering and slaughtering.
[01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:18.682]  Arsons, where you'll have 13 attacks in a single night in Arizona.
[01:44:18.742 --> 01:44:19.803]  Homes being burned.
[01:44:20.383 --> 01:44:24.166]  Screaming, laughing people as they throw mall-offs on whites' homes.
[01:44:25.506 --> 01:44:26.827]  Just hell on earth.
[01:44:26.927 --> 01:44:28.588]  Total rampaging death.
[01:44:29.309 --> 01:44:30.870]  And the average person isn't even aware of it.
[01:44:30.930 --> 01:44:33.191]  Because the media knows out of sight, out of mind.
[01:44:33.251 --> 01:44:34.052]  Perception is reality.
[01:44:34.392 --> 01:44:35.472]  They just don't report on it.
[01:44:35.552 --> 01:44:36.533]  Or it's in the back of the paper.
[01:44:37.674 --> 01:44:39.355]  Oh yeah, car bomb went off.
[01:44:39.415 --> 01:44:40.616]  Blew up the Suburban.
[01:44:42.136 --> 01:44:43.397]  Killed the two people inside.
[01:44:43.437 --> 01:44:44.538]  It was a Los Setas hit.
[01:44:46.179 --> 01:44:48.700]  Oh, rockets and machine guns are being fired at Border Patrol.
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:49.480]  It's okay.
[01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:51.200]  Rocket-propelled grenades are no big deal.
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:53.881]  Border Patrol's been ordered not to fire back.
[01:44:57.561 --> 01:44:58.442]  This is our country.
[01:45:03.383 --> 01:45:05.203]  My wife went to college in France.
[01:45:06.543 --> 01:45:08.244]  She got a degree out of this town.
[01:45:08.284 --> 01:45:09.604]  I guess you'd call it conque.
[01:45:09.864 --> 01:45:10.224]  Conque?
[01:45:11.304 --> 01:45:11.984]  She'll get mad at me.
[01:45:12.024 --> 01:45:14.365]  I can't hardly speak English, much less French.
[01:45:15.365 --> 01:45:24.493]  But she said, it's such a beautiful city, and the whole town is going to be turned into a test zone where you buy your groceries biometrically with RFID integrated.
[01:45:25.094 --> 01:45:26.435]  The cars will all be tracked.
[01:45:26.475 --> 01:45:29.658]  Well, here it is out of silicon.com, big computer publication.
[01:45:30.999 --> 01:45:32.821]  French road test, cashless city.
[01:45:34.082 --> 01:45:41.028]  The can't do attitude towards, so that's the joke, the can do attitude, the can't do attitude towards mobile services.
[01:45:42.469 --> 01:45:56.584]  The tourist city of Cologne in Normandy is hosting a major European trial of the use of NFC near-field communication, a mobile technology that can be used for anything from paying for groceries to finding out about your hometown.
[01:45:58.265 --> 01:46:01.669]  This is already extensively used across London, although you might not know it.
[01:46:02.049 --> 01:46:03.651]  The Oyster card carried by millions of
[01:46:04.460 --> 01:46:08.961]  Customers and commuters every day is based on the contactless RFID system.
[01:46:09.421 --> 01:46:12.242]  And this new one says there's going to be readers everywhere and everything will be cashless.
[01:46:12.262 --> 01:46:12.742]  So, there you go.
[01:46:14.022 --> 01:46:15.783]  And even when you pay cash, you'll have to swipe a card.
[01:46:15.803 --> 01:46:16.463]  So, there you go.
[01:46:17.283 --> 01:46:18.563]  And notice what's happening in France.
[01:46:18.623 --> 01:46:19.524]  It's happening in New York.
[01:46:19.544 --> 01:46:20.304]  It's happening in London.
[01:46:20.344 --> 01:46:22.464]  It's happening in Sweden.
[01:46:22.524 --> 01:46:23.625]  It's happening in Deutschland.
[01:46:23.665 --> 01:46:24.785]  It's happening in Moscow.
[01:46:25.145 --> 01:46:27.045]  It's happening in Perth, Australia.
[01:46:27.385 --> 01:46:28.586]  It's happening in New Zealand.
[01:46:28.706 --> 01:46:29.866]  It's happening in Argentina.
[01:46:31.531 --> 01:46:37.853]  A global world ID tax, a fuel tax, a sales tax being pushed by Borts and other fake conservatives.
[01:46:38.173 --> 01:46:38.774]  It's a nightmare.
[01:46:42.535 --> 01:46:44.295]  This is the reality.
[01:46:49.497 --> 01:46:50.738]  And I don't even know what to say anymore.
[01:46:53.439 --> 01:46:56.060]  Let me flip to the stack here and get into Iran.
[01:46:57.760 --> 01:47:00.161]  Iran leader issues warning to US.
[01:47:01.335 --> 01:47:01.635]  U.S.
[01:47:01.675 --> 01:47:05.937]  interest around the world will be harmed if America launches an attack against Iran.
[01:47:05.957 --> 01:47:14.962]  Supreme Leader Ayatollah Al Khamenei has said the Iranian nation will respond to any blow with double the intensity, he said in comments reported on Tuesday.
[01:47:17.603 --> 01:47:24.987]  Iran has referred to the UN Security Council for possible sanctions of over its nuclear program.
[01:47:25.447 --> 01:47:28.269]  The West fears Iran is seeking atomic weapons.
[01:47:30.070 --> 01:47:30.210]  Now,
[01:47:31.914 --> 01:47:37.237]  They ought to know, the Iranians ought to know, the globalists want them to attack the shipping, they want them to attack the pipelines.
[01:47:37.297 --> 01:47:41.099]  When they strike back, and I can't believe it, the Iranians are the worst scum on earth.
[01:47:41.119 --> 01:47:45.981]  Can you imagine that if they get nuked or attacked?
[01:47:46.001 --> 01:47:46.461]  214, 216 sites?
[01:47:46.521 --> 01:47:52.885]  Can you imagine if America got attacked and already had special forces in it, admittedly, preparing to attack?
[01:47:53.885 --> 01:47:56.166]  Can you imagine that if we got attacked we would fight back?
[01:47:56.726 --> 01:47:57.587]  We'd be scum too.
[01:47:58.761 --> 01:48:00.903]  And I can't believe how bad Iran is.
[01:48:00.923 --> 01:48:08.108]  I mean, can you imagine them saying that if they're attacked, and Bush is saying with nuclear weapons, that they would fight back.
[01:48:08.228 --> 01:48:09.409]  I've never heard of something so bad.
[01:48:09.429 --> 01:48:18.436]  In fact, if your wife's in a parking garage and some guy tries to rape her, I would hope that if she fights back, the police would arrest her and charge her with attempted murder.
[01:48:21.218 --> 01:48:23.339]  And of course, in England, I shouldn't joke around.
[01:48:23.399 --> 01:48:25.081]  In England, they actually do that now.
[01:48:25.421 --> 01:48:28.043]  If you stab someone raping or attacking you, you go to prison.
[01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:31.421]  So maybe I shouldn't joke around.
[01:48:31.882 --> 01:48:36.846]  But seriously, Iran says they'll fight back, and boom boy, that is just very amazing.
[01:48:37.526 --> 01:48:38.747]  Iran could respond to U.S.
[01:48:38.807 --> 01:48:43.811]  offensive by attacking Baruch-Saihan pipeline, Tehran official says.
[01:48:44.572 --> 01:48:54.360]  Israel will launch eye in the sky over Iran, report they're going to launch, in fact they have launched now, this is from yesterday, a satellite which will enhance its ability to spy on Iran.
[01:48:58.872 --> 01:49:00.733]  S&P Standard and Poor's Report.
[01:49:00.753 --> 01:49:02.953]  New figures show oil reserves at record levels.
[01:49:04.434 --> 01:49:08.955]  Don't tell the peak oil scammers on the big oil payroll that.
[01:49:10.396 --> 01:49:11.916]  China, Russia, Central Asia.
[01:49:12.536 --> 01:49:14.817]  States to stage joint anti-terror exercise.
[01:49:15.237 --> 01:49:19.178]  Worldwide governments are using the fake war on terror to crack down on their own people.
[01:49:19.618 --> 01:49:25.640]  China, Russia, and four Central Asian countries agreed Wednesday to hold a joint military exercise against terrorism next year in Russia.
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:27.521]  Russian Defense Minister Sergei
[01:49:29.719 --> 01:49:30.579]  I know all I've said.
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:32.560]  We'll come back.
[01:49:32.580 --> 01:49:33.780]  I know you've been holding some of you.
[01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:36.641]  We'll take your calls into the second segment of the next hour.
[01:49:37.021 --> 01:49:41.161]  We've got Pastor Butch Paul joining us, eight after, to cover some really important stuff.
[01:49:41.181 --> 01:49:42.782]  I've got a bunch of other news I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:49:43.102 --> 01:49:45.322]  We'll bring it all up with Pastor Butch and get his take on it.
[01:49:45.742 --> 01:49:46.683]  He's quite an individual.
[01:49:48.563 --> 01:49:51.144]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv are the websites.
[01:49:51.184 --> 01:49:52.504]  Be sure and visit the online bookstore.
[01:49:55.051 --> 01:49:57.914]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:58.175 --> 01:49:59.757]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:50:00.097 --> 01:50:04.783]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:05.103 --> 01:50:11.851]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:12.171 --> 01:50:14.153]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:50:14.353 --> 01:50:17.195]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:17.295 --> 01:50:21.939]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:22.159 --> 01:50:26.562]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.803 --> 01:50:34.028]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:34.269 --> 01:50:36.690]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[01:50:56.132 --> 01:51:06.836]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:51:07.216 --> 01:51:11.738]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:51:11.798 --> 01:51:23.142]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:51:23.722 --> 01:51:30.589]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.

[01:52:40.746 --> 01:52:43.828]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.

[01:53:10.930 --> 01:53:18.739]  Before we do that, you know, I carry dozens and dozens and dozens of other documentaries and books by other wonderful authors.

[01:55:18.361 --> 01:55:19.421]  Jerry in Oklahoma.

[01:55:20.082 --> 01:55:20.502]  Go ahead.
[01:55:20.522 --> 01:55:21.663]  Hi, Alex.
[01:55:21.703 --> 01:55:25.265]  Yeah, I was just in the industry for the past year, so I support you.
[01:55:25.826 --> 01:55:27.287]  And also, I have a question.
[01:55:28.207 --> 01:55:35.212]  I've been told that Bush owns a quarter interest in the oil companies, and a lot of them in Texas, in the oil company itself.
[01:55:35.652 --> 01:55:42.236]  And also, I was wondering, Boone Pickens said in the headline newspaper here while back at gas would be $5 a gallon.
[01:55:43.496 --> 01:55:46.517]  And he said, we didn't have the technology for alcohol.
[01:55:46.918 --> 01:55:48.939]  Well, we've had the technology for a long time.
[01:55:49.359 --> 01:55:51.780]  And Brazil's running 97% on alcohol.
[01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:54.181]  So I was just wondering, what's your take on all this?
[01:55:55.562 --> 01:56:00.344]  Well, we've got so much corn that how many billions of bushels rot?
[01:56:00.424 --> 01:56:01.705]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[01:56:02.645 --> 01:56:08.608]  And corn in existing refineries, what, it'd be under $1 a gallon, and it burns clean?
[01:56:09.188 --> 01:56:10.169]  Engines just love it?
[01:56:10.949 --> 01:56:11.369]  Yes, sir.
[01:56:11.669 --> 01:56:12.810]  Yeah, and you know, that's
[01:56:13.294 --> 01:56:17.357]  That's the thing, they said engines would last three times longer than alcohol.
[01:56:17.698 --> 01:56:21.041]  No, I've seen the studies going back to the 40s and 50s and 60s.
[01:56:21.081 --> 01:56:26.585]  Sir, there's an oligopoly of less than 12 oil companies and they work in concert to jack up prices.
[01:56:27.026 --> 01:56:32.590]  We learned this from Bilderberg meeting last year that it would go over $100 a barrel and they never lie, they run things.
[01:56:32.670 --> 01:56:36.574]  So, they're going to rape the daylights out of us, but don't worry, Bush says he's investigating.
[01:56:37.174 --> 01:56:42.597]  Yeah, so is it true he does own a big interest in the old companies?
[01:56:42.757 --> 01:56:43.598]  Well, I don't know which.
[01:56:43.858 --> 01:56:44.578]  He was in Harkin.
[01:56:44.598 --> 01:56:45.539]  He was in Arbusto.
[01:56:45.859 --> 01:56:48.521]  The Bushes are old money, so they're like the Rockefellers.
[01:56:48.581 --> 01:56:49.681]  Most of their money is hidden.
[01:56:50.221 --> 01:56:56.545]  They own, in some cases, over 35% of two separate major prison industry companies.
[01:56:57.005 --> 01:56:58.286]  They own banking stock.
[01:56:58.306 --> 01:56:59.987]  I mean, I know a bunch of people that work in banking.
[01:57:00.007 --> 01:57:03.269]  I know a person on the board of a big bank that the Bushes are on.
[01:57:04.069 --> 01:57:06.330]  Uh, they own just, you name it, they own it, sir.
[01:57:06.630 --> 01:57:08.551]  They're worth tens of billions of dollars.
[01:57:09.452 --> 01:57:09.752]  Right.
[01:57:10.092 --> 01:57:16.795]  Yeah, so that's... But every year when you read about, you know, Parade Magazine, what Bush is worth, it'll say, oh, he's worth five million.
[01:57:17.115 --> 01:57:18.275]  Yeah, and I'm an Easter Bunny.
[01:57:20.917 --> 01:57:21.677]  You had something else?
[01:57:22.279 --> 01:57:27.943]  No, just more or less that I hope gasoline comes back down, but don't look like it's coming very soon at all.
[01:57:28.263 --> 01:57:29.204]  Well, they've got to shock us.
[01:57:29.244 --> 01:57:29.804]  Thank you for the call.
[01:57:29.824 --> 01:57:32.626]  They've got to run it up to six bucks and then bring it back down to four.
[01:57:33.166 --> 01:57:33.466]  Right.
[01:57:33.747 --> 01:57:38.350]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-376-45.
[01:57:38.410 --> 01:57:38.710]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.517 --> 01:57:52.577]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.277 --> 01:57:54.378]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.038 --> 01:57:55.858]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.618 --> 01:57:57.519]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.539 --> 01:58:01.920]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:08.281]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:10.702 --> 01:58:14.623]  Now into hour number three, a bunch of other news coming up.
[01:58:14.643 --> 01:58:19.024]  President Brzezinski says airstrike on Iran could merit the impeachment of President Bush.
[01:58:20.373 --> 01:58:23.694]  Bill forbids mandatory microchip implants in animals, AP.
[01:58:24.494 --> 01:58:27.635]  Survey Americans uncomfortable with new surveillance technologies.
[01:58:28.096 --> 01:58:30.396]  Big Brother checks on parked cars.
[01:58:30.436 --> 01:58:31.957]  A bunch of news on that.
[01:58:32.377 --> 01:58:35.638]  Still ridiculing people who talk about forced microchip implants.
[01:58:35.998 --> 01:58:37.879]  An article by Steve Watson that's excellent.
[01:58:38.459 --> 01:58:40.180]  Really scary report out of Texas.
[01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:41.580]  Texas training pamphlet.
[01:58:41.940 --> 01:58:45.762]  Nice guys who wear Levi's and travel with children are likely terrorists.
[01:58:45.782 --> 01:58:47.022]  That's out of the actual manual.
[01:58:48.055 --> 01:58:48.815]  Where is that manual?
[01:58:48.835 --> 01:58:50.776]  He brought that in here earlier and put it on my desk.
[01:58:51.537 --> 01:58:52.017]  There it is.
[01:58:52.697 --> 01:59:00.241]  And I want to remember Ukraine, too, and the Chernobyl disaster of 20 years ago and liken it to the DU today.
[01:59:00.921 --> 01:59:02.842]  But right now, let's go to Kim in Texas.
[01:59:03.342 --> 01:59:04.003]  Go ahead, Kim.
[01:59:04.863 --> 01:59:05.463]  Hey, Alex.
[01:59:05.663 --> 01:59:12.967]  You said something earlier about aspartame that was really actually reassuring to me because I stopped consuming
[01:59:13.866 --> 01:59:20.695]  After paying about two months ago and I could have swore that I was having withdrawals and you said something about it being addicting.
[01:59:20.715 --> 01:59:22.297]  Yeah, are you on a cordless phone?
[01:59:22.698 --> 01:59:23.699]  Yeah, I am actually.
[01:59:23.739 --> 01:59:24.821]  Can you get closer to the base?
[01:59:25.041 --> 01:59:25.502]  Yeah, I can.
[01:59:26.912 --> 01:59:27.432]  Is that better?
[01:59:27.912 --> 01:59:28.312]  Not really.
[01:59:28.352 --> 01:59:31.353]  It sounds like you're talking to us through 10 feet of water, but that's okay.
[01:59:32.694 --> 01:59:33.114]  Yes, yes.
[01:59:33.614 --> 01:59:35.254]  It's an addictive neurotoxin.
[01:59:35.274 --> 01:59:39.896]  Many poisons are addictive and that's scientifically proven by medical doctors and major studies.
[01:59:40.436 --> 01:59:41.436]  That's why they push it.
[01:59:41.996 --> 01:59:47.278]  And yes, you have... My mother finally went off of it a few months ago and she had extreme withdrawals.
[01:59:47.638 --> 01:59:48.138]  Well, yeah.
[01:59:48.258 --> 01:59:49.839]  I had headaches, nausea.
[01:59:50.059 --> 01:59:50.999]  I was just achy.
[01:59:51.079 --> 01:59:52.559]  I couldn't figure out what was wrong with me.
[01:59:52.659 --> 01:59:53.260]  Fatigue.
[01:59:53.320 --> 01:59:54.360]  And that was the only thing I could
[01:59:54.983 --> 02:00:02.905]  You know, pinpointed on, and I wasn't sure, and then you actually just said something earlier about that, so it kind of makes sense now, because it was just cold turkey.
[02:00:02.965 --> 02:00:03.766]  I just threw it out.
[02:00:03.786 --> 02:00:08.367]  I said no more, and so... Well, you got to watch out, because most processed foods have it now.
[02:00:08.747 --> 02:00:11.668]  Yeah, I was going to say... Hot dogs, bologna, chips...
[02:00:12.752 --> 02:00:17.474]  You can actually go and there are lists on websites that show what all has it in there.
[02:00:17.514 --> 02:00:20.735]  Yeah, now they call it artificial flavor or natural flavor.
[02:00:21.196 --> 02:00:22.336]  Right, exactly.
[02:00:22.696 --> 02:00:26.618]  And then I also wanted to say something else about illegal immigration real quick.
[02:00:27.478 --> 02:00:30.379]  My family came here, you know, about a hundred years ago.
[02:00:30.419 --> 02:00:35.121]  They immigrated here and when they came here they wanted to assimilate.
[02:00:35.742 --> 02:00:39.383]  They didn't walk around wearing shirts that said, we came, we saw, we conquered.
[02:00:39.803 --> 02:00:41.444]  I see shirts like that, you know,
[02:00:41.943 --> 02:00:42.624]  Here in Texas.
[02:00:42.744 --> 02:00:44.105]  Oh, believe me, I know, ma'am.
[02:00:44.525 --> 02:00:50.591]  And so, I mean, and you know, my grandparents and my parents were not allowed to speak German.
[02:00:50.651 --> 02:00:52.212]  They had to speak English.
[02:00:52.513 --> 02:00:53.854]  Well, I mean, they conquered what?
[02:00:53.874 --> 02:00:56.596]  They're going to be slaves like they are in Mexico.
[02:00:56.616 --> 02:00:58.138]  They're trying to bring down a free country.
[02:00:58.598 --> 02:01:00.300]  They worked for the globalists, openly.
[02:01:00.842 --> 02:01:01.883]  Yes, I know.
[02:01:01.923 --> 02:01:08.748]  So I just want people out there to know that, you know, I know that there are a lot of illegal immigrants all over the United States.
[02:01:08.848 --> 02:01:14.132]  What do you say to these people when they're wearing shirts that say, this is Mexico, or we came, we saw, we conquered?
[02:01:15.020 --> 02:01:16.781]  Well, you know, I'm usually with my children.
[02:01:16.821 --> 02:01:22.265]  We're at an amusement park or something, so I can't really get into a confrontation with anybody.
[02:01:22.325 --> 02:01:24.866]  But, you know, I don't usually say anything to them.
[02:01:24.926 --> 02:01:26.827]  You know, I say something to whoever I'm with.
[02:01:26.867 --> 02:01:29.609]  Well, when I see it, I go, man, you're really fooled by the new world order.
[02:01:29.629 --> 02:01:30.890]  You know, they're staging all of this.
[02:01:31.410 --> 02:01:34.012]  That's why people have been slaves in Mexico for thousands of years.
[02:01:34.052 --> 02:01:37.194]  You've never gotten out of slavery, and you won't now, because you won't figure it out.
[02:01:38.054 --> 02:01:38.775]  You're right, Alex.
[02:01:39.095 --> 02:01:40.616]  I'll have to remember that next time.
[02:01:41.826 --> 02:01:45.348]  Well, maybe it's best when you're a nice little lady with your children not to do it.
[02:01:45.368 --> 02:01:46.909]  Yeah, you know.
[02:01:47.270 --> 02:01:50.932]  And the other reason is that they get very defensive about it, I've noticed.
[02:01:51.272 --> 02:01:52.773]  Well, the media is trying to cover this up.
[02:01:52.793 --> 02:02:00.098]  See, the media, again the big corporate media, is desperately trying to hide the fact that it's just vicious anti-Americanism.
[02:02:00.418 --> 02:02:01.038]  But you know what?
[02:02:01.078 --> 02:02:02.419]  They can't un-ring that bell.
[02:02:02.780 --> 02:02:03.720]  The truth is out.
[02:02:04.501 --> 02:02:05.721]  And you know what else, Alex?
[02:02:05.801 --> 02:02:09.444]  They teach our public school teachers that we're all going to be brown.
[02:02:10.441 --> 02:02:21.949]  There will not be any more... No, no, I was taught in anthropology and psychology they would just announce, here is a picture of a person in a hundred years, being white is bad, everyone will mix, you will look like this.
[02:02:22.529 --> 02:02:24.430]  That's right, that's what they're teaching our kids.
[02:02:25.031 --> 02:02:29.994]  No, no, they sit there and racially teach your children they're bad if they're white in public school.
[02:02:30.875 --> 02:02:34.257]  And again, this is run by our government to just simply destroy any culture.
[02:02:34.952 --> 02:02:35.513]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:02:35.894 --> 02:02:36.274]  Thank you.
[02:02:36.735 --> 02:02:44.847]  Yeah, I mean, we have people saying, you will assimilate, we will kill you, ha ha ha, and we're supposed to go, oh yes, kill me, I love you, kill me, kill me.
[02:02:46.690 --> 02:02:49.575]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:02:50.291 --> 02:02:51.572]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:02:51.773 --> 02:02:57.518]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:02:57.798 --> 02:03:03.064]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:03:03.344 --> 02:03:07.468]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:03:07.788 --> 02:03:11.431]  Nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:03:11.691 --> 02:03:16.315]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:03:16.435 --> 02:03:22.679]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.740 --> 02:03:24.561]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[02:03:25.041 --> 02:03:27.123]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.
[02:03:27.203 --> 02:03:30.586]  Call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:03:30.887 --> 02:03:32.148]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[02:03:33.089 --> 02:03:38.754]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[02:03:38.854 --> 02:03:40.856]  You see Big Brother's afraid of this documentary.
[02:03:41.096 --> 02:03:42.618]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:03:42.778 --> 02:03:44.840]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:03:45.851 --> 02:03:49.113]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:03:49.173 --> 02:03:53.376]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:03:53.616 --> 02:03:56.398]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:03:56.598 --> 02:03:59.000]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:03:59.180 --> 02:04:07.825]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:04:08.025 --> 02:04:09.366]  The Berkeley Light is different.
[02:04:09.566 --> 02:04:13.729]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:04:14.049 --> 02:04:14.829]  We're good to go!
[02:04:42.856 --> 02:04:47.120]  Hey folks, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:04:47.460 --> 02:04:51.423]  You've all heard me on the radio talking about the importance of investing in precious metals.
[02:04:51.804 --> 02:04:55.327]  I feel it's time for me to talk about the importance of investing in your health.
[02:04:55.707 --> 02:04:59.250]  I was presented with the opportunity to try Tri-Vibes from TriVortex.
[02:04:59.651 --> 02:05:04.515]  I was a bit hesitant of the idea of absorbing vitamins by wearing them rather than ingesting them.
[02:05:04.835 --> 02:05:10.623]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[02:05:10.943 --> 02:05:14.648]  I now wear my TriVibes bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever.
[02:05:15.008 --> 02:05:17.071]  Not only physically, but also mentally.
[02:05:17.091 --> 02:05:23.199]  TriVortex also offers amazingly beneficial and beautiful jewelry worn by the women around the office daily.
[02:05:23.599 --> 02:05:24.800]  TriVortex is amazing.
[02:05:25.120 --> 02:05:26.220]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:05:26.320 --> 02:05:31.722]  Try TriVortex yourself and have fun and learn with the tests found on TriVortex.com.
[02:05:31.922 --> 02:05:35.384]  That's T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com.
[02:05:35.684 --> 02:05:36.984]  Or call my friend Brian at 619-884-1455.
[02:05:37.024 --> 02:05:37.304]  That's 619-884-1455.
[02:05:50.367 --> 02:05:50.988]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.668 --> 02:05:52.729]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.430 --> 02:05:54.551]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:55.211 --> 02:05:56.012]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.773 --> 02:05:57.653]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.673 --> 02:06:02.297]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.518 --> 02:06:06.641]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:07.162 --> 02:06:14.168]  There's an extremely important article posted on the main page of PrisonPlanet.com right now
[02:06:16.730 --> 02:06:25.217]  Concerning terrorism, what the public needs to know, Texas Department of Public Safety Criminal Law Enforcement pamphlet, hundreds of thousands of these have been given out in Texas.
[02:06:25.277 --> 02:06:44.092]  It says people using cell phones, people with children, people who are wearing Levi's, people who are nice to the police, it says friendly to the police, people at any demonstration or rally, or who have websites or newspapers, public rallies, demonstrations, private meetings sponsored by support groups,
[02:06:45.040 --> 02:06:46.581]  Open meetings, closed meetings.
[02:06:47.982 --> 02:06:54.406]  It says, trained to avoid confrontations with law enforcement, and therefore can be expected to project a nice guy image.
[02:06:55.907 --> 02:07:00.890]  It says these are, quote, signs of terrorism, if you have suspicions.
[02:07:01.871 --> 02:07:04.753]  And it lists here, what do they call them?
[02:07:04.833 --> 02:07:06.214]  Pre-incident indicators.
[02:07:06.734 --> 02:07:07.775]  Now this is out of Texas.
[02:07:07.795 --> 02:07:09.416]  Then we have the thing that's six years old.
[02:07:12.455 --> 02:07:19.716]  Out of Phoenix, put out by the FBI Joint Task Force, and it says, those that make frequent references to the U.S.
[02:07:19.756 --> 02:07:25.298]  Constitution, exact quote, make numerous references to the U.S.
[02:07:25.338 --> 02:07:32.819]  Constitution, and it mentions gun owners, people that criticize the United Nations, people that criticize the fellow deserved.
[02:07:33.239 --> 02:07:34.079]  These are quotes.
[02:07:35.339 --> 02:07:38.040]  Then we have the new Virginia Training Manual that goes further.
[02:07:38.974 --> 02:07:41.095]  And says property rights activists.
[02:07:41.115 --> 02:07:44.575]  We have other manuals that say all homeschoolers, all Christians.
[02:07:45.596 --> 02:07:49.277]  You could not make this up in an Outer Limits Twilight Zone episode.
[02:07:50.577 --> 02:07:58.179]  And Homeland Security admittedly has gone out to churches nationwide asking them to quote, surveil their members, the flock.
[02:07:59.414 --> 02:08:02.115]  To look for anyone criticizing the government in their ranks.
[02:08:02.195 --> 02:08:07.276]  They want the preachers to enroll with them and get federal money, which is unconstitutional.
[02:08:07.316 --> 02:08:11.977]  Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[02:08:12.657 --> 02:08:13.718]  It's all going on.
[02:08:13.758 --> 02:08:23.240]  Now they're going to charge this poor Chinese doctor, this American woman, who's Chinese, who's an organ transplant physician, who confronted Hu last week.
[02:08:23.260 --> 02:08:27.061]  They're charging her with intimidating a foreign official under a terrorism clause.
[02:08:27.867 --> 02:08:30.489]  They're arresting people who peacefully demonstrate.
[02:08:30.509 --> 02:08:32.891]  They won't let us in Austin or anywhere else now demonstrate.
[02:08:33.111 --> 02:08:38.414]  They make you go to a baseball field hundreds of yards, or in some cases, miles away, where no one can hear from you.
[02:08:38.915 --> 02:08:42.197]  At every level, they're butchering this country's sovereignty.
[02:08:42.577 --> 02:08:45.659]  Then the media pushes the illegal aliens to demonstrate.
[02:08:46.080 --> 02:08:49.822]  Their companies tell them, oh hey, you can get off today to go protest.
[02:08:50.263 --> 02:08:52.084]  It's a total breakdown of our society.
[02:08:52.644 --> 02:08:56.347]  And joining us is Pastor Butch Paw, who has produced a new film, The Beast Exposed.
[02:08:56.907 --> 02:08:59.408]  That, by the way, we carry at InfoWars.com.
[02:08:59.428 --> 02:09:02.730]  We've got another big meeting and seminar conference coming up.
[02:09:03.110 --> 02:09:04.570]  Pastor Butch, good to have you here with us.
[02:09:04.871 --> 02:09:05.591]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:09:05.691 --> 02:09:07.392]  It's always an honor and a privilege to be with you.
[02:09:07.532 --> 02:09:09.072]  I really enjoy your program.
[02:09:09.453 --> 02:09:16.356]  I'm amazed at the things you talk about that are being confirmed today, that you talked about years ago, and myself also on the radio.
[02:09:16.416 --> 02:09:26.000]  It's being confirmed today, 10 and 12 years later, and the last seminar we did that you carry, exposing the beast seminar on what's happening in society, the tracking, the marking,
[02:09:26.638 --> 02:09:29.440]  The mind control is all on that tape.
[02:09:29.500 --> 02:09:32.081]  I just sit back and listen to you talk and I think, this is phenomenal.
[02:09:32.401 --> 02:09:37.164]  I mean, it's almost prophetic, what you're saying is coming to pass.
[02:09:38.205 --> 02:09:46.749]  I'm astounded, astounded, at the ignorance of the people of this country as a whole that can't see these things when there's obviously the elephant in your front room.
[02:09:47.250 --> 02:09:53.953]  Well, Pastor Butch, for those that don't know who you are or haven't heard your show, it's on from 8 to 9 Central here on the GCN Radio Network and heard on 96.3 every night.
[02:09:55.572 --> 02:10:02.217]  Here in Austin, but I wanted to just, of course, you were in covert operations in Vietnam, in Cambodia.
[02:10:02.257 --> 02:10:03.477]  We can't say any more about that.
[02:10:04.038 --> 02:10:11.503]  You're a family man, a grandparent, and of course, you're a pastor, but you also don't take a bunch of money from your members.
[02:10:11.543 --> 02:10:15.125]  You go and work a full-time job every day, just like Paul did.
[02:10:15.726 --> 02:10:19.388]  And Pastor Butch Paul, we are honored to have you with us today.
[02:10:19.808 --> 02:10:24.211]  I wanted you, because I've heard your show lately, you've been getting into how they're coming into the churches.
[02:10:24.251 --> 02:10:25.172]  We've confirmed this.
[02:10:25.552 --> 02:10:25.732]  Yes.
[02:10:25.852 --> 02:10:27.133]  And trying to take them over.
[02:10:27.273 --> 02:10:28.734]  I mean, we are becoming China.
[02:10:29.334 --> 02:10:29.854]  Absolutely.
[02:10:29.894 --> 02:10:34.036]  And by the way, the folks who want to listen to the shortwave, I'm on 3.215 every night, 2 to 9 o'clock p.m.
[02:10:34.056 --> 02:10:34.356]  Eastern.
[02:10:34.777 --> 02:10:37.938]  And on several AMFM stations, on our website, PastorButch.com.
[02:10:38.278 --> 02:10:39.359]  But you're right on.
[02:10:39.559 --> 02:10:51.445]  I have, we'll say, an inside source from a pastor in Ohio who is, was, I believe, selected by our Creator to be one of the pastors called out by FEMA to serve FEMA.
[02:10:51.465 --> 02:10:53.046]  Now folks, we're not making this up.
[02:10:53.086 --> 02:10:53.886]  This is a fact.
[02:10:53.966 --> 02:10:55.167]  I can guarantee this is true.
[02:10:55.737 --> 02:11:04.620]  The pastors, this is all on our website, pastorbush.com, the pastors in Ohio and other states too, but Ohio is our main focus because we have so many there.
[02:11:05.091 --> 02:11:07.032]  Working with them on the inside.
[02:11:07.092 --> 02:11:25.058]  And by the way the reason I know his particular claims are true is they don't give us all the details but I know what FEMA does at other similar meetings and they said quote in the future for disaster and civil emergency that the churches are going to be and the schools the center of this so we know there's a program now we've learned what's happening behind closed doors.
[02:11:25.478 --> 02:11:28.699]  Well we do know that they're going out to the pastors
[02:11:29.179 --> 02:11:54.578]  Not only to the pastors, Alex, but also to the hairdressers, to the funeral parlors, anyone who's influenced in the community, to go to those people and ask them to influence the people to follow the rules of FEMA and government under disasters, whether it's, we'll say, a natural disaster or a plague or a terrorist attack, but to go on to the pastors and other people, leaders of the community, to ask them to be the frontrunners, for example,
[02:11:55.014 --> 02:12:00.559]  They said that they want to kill Farmer John's flock off because they say he has mad cow disease.
[02:12:00.599 --> 02:12:04.863]  He's heard off and they're going to send a passenger in first to tell Farmer John to put up his shotgun.
[02:12:05.353 --> 02:12:07.715]  Don't fight this, because after all, it's for his own good.
[02:12:07.735 --> 02:12:09.876]  Now, Alex, it goes beyond that.
[02:12:09.976 --> 02:12:14.179]  Now, basically, this is a... Now, they've admitted that they've hired 100,000 spies.
[02:12:15.219 --> 02:12:29.888]  I've had, from Tennessee, I've had people on, like, their local volunteer coordinator, who's a top professor, a few months ago, and they admitted that, literally, this is the spy propaganda corps, and much of it is PR and propaganda.
[02:12:29.968 --> 02:12:31.749]  The same thing Hitler did, exactly.
[02:12:31.809 --> 02:12:34.351]  Now, these pastors and other community leaders
[02:12:34.711 --> 02:12:45.802]  They're expected, we think so, at least in the churches or whatever, are going in to be the ones that will go before FEMA and try to pave the way for them to come in and peacefully take over the communities.
[02:12:46.262 --> 02:12:47.783]  And the commissariat.
[02:12:48.264 --> 02:12:48.724]  Exactly.
[02:12:48.784 --> 02:12:50.526]  This is a reverse of COINTELPRO.
[02:12:50.826 --> 02:12:54.089]  In the 60s and 70s, and these have now been declassified, the church hearings of 1977,
[02:12:56.684 --> 02:12:58.686]  They go and have files on every preacher.
[02:12:58.746 --> 02:12:59.766]  Who will work for them?
[02:12:59.806 --> 02:13:00.747]  Who will work against them?
[02:13:00.767 --> 02:13:01.047]  That's right.
[02:13:01.267 --> 02:13:02.488]  Anybody that can influence.
[02:13:02.748 --> 02:13:09.173]  FEMA is excited, according to our sources, because the response to the pastors has been overwhelmingly favorable for FEMA.
[02:13:09.213 --> 02:13:11.535]  Now, on top of that, folks, this is on our site.
[02:13:12.035 --> 02:13:13.396]  They take an oath.
[02:13:14.517 --> 02:13:17.199]  The pastors must take an oath to serve FEMA.
[02:13:17.259 --> 02:13:17.939]  Now, this is on there.
[02:13:17.959 --> 02:13:18.740]  I'm not just making this up.
[02:13:19.481 --> 02:13:25.545]  And also, they must have an ID card with their thumbprint and all the information on that that they have to show that they are with FEMA.
[02:13:25.990 --> 02:13:31.112]  And that they're legitimately trying to work with FEMA to go into the communities.
[02:13:31.772 --> 02:13:35.673]  And the government's got to do this before they launch martial law.
[02:13:35.933 --> 02:13:37.654]  And they're getting all their ducks in a row.
[02:13:38.214 --> 02:13:49.498]  Now, I've had a pastor on that's involved in this twice, and I had him on again on the 16th of May, the day after the next meeting they're going to have, for more information.
[02:13:49.518 --> 02:13:51.239]  Well, Butch, can you give me his number?
[02:13:51.279 --> 02:13:52.059]  I want to get him on.
[02:13:52.139 --> 02:13:53.299]  I certainly can.
[02:13:53.479 --> 02:13:54.980]  Off the air, I'll give it to you.
[02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:55.420]  I sure will.
[02:13:55.851 --> 02:13:57.231]  But this is so important, folks.
[02:13:57.251 --> 02:13:58.371]  This is so important.
[02:13:58.672 --> 02:14:03.032]  They're setting us up now for the final takedown on every level.
[02:14:03.412 --> 02:14:06.933]  Our meeting's coming up on June 3rd here in West Virginia, in West Virginia.
[02:14:07.273 --> 02:14:09.073]  I'm asking people, I'm begging people to come, Alex.
[02:14:09.473 --> 02:14:10.354]  I'm begging to come.
[02:14:10.374 --> 02:14:11.754]  We're doing it as cheaply as possible.
[02:14:12.114 --> 02:14:14.214]  We have an all-day meeting, plus a meal for $35.
[02:14:14.414 --> 02:14:15.595]  We're meeting for $20.
[02:14:16.155 --> 02:14:23.096]  It's an all-day meeting with speakers that are unbelievable, that are going to expose what's going on inside the powers that be.
[02:14:24.283 --> 02:14:27.165]  We're begging to come and see this because we're running out of time here.
[02:14:27.645 --> 02:14:31.507]  Either we get our eyes open now, or we're not going to get them open at all.
[02:14:31.767 --> 02:14:34.889]  We're going into the system so fast and so quickly.
[02:14:36.009 --> 02:14:41.813]  The 5th of last month, this month, I'm sorry, April, we are fighting the National ID Card here in West Virginia.
[02:14:41.833 --> 02:14:46.235]  And I said, I guess I'm the spearhead of that, on the Real ID Act.
[02:14:46.275 --> 02:14:48.356]  We had a meeting with the head of the DMV here in the state.
[02:14:48.777 --> 02:14:50.318]  A meeting with the head of Legislative Aid?
[02:14:50.338 --> 02:14:54.820]  That's right, you've been in the front page of the paper and they're going, why doesn't the pastor like this?
[02:14:54.860 --> 02:14:58.922]  And you've had Christians call you up and go, it's of the Lord, we must take it!
[02:14:59.082 --> 02:15:01.543]  Oh yeah, well of course, why should we fight this?
[02:15:01.663 --> 02:15:02.263]  Bible!
[02:15:02.683 --> 02:15:13.748]  Well, I won't get into that, that could be a whole sermon by itself, but the head of the DMV is on our side, not necessarily for the same reasons, but he's on our side to stop this, he's going to recommend to the government that we don't do this.
[02:15:14.208 --> 02:15:17.730]  His head of Legislative Aid was there, also their head lawyer was there,
[02:15:18.248 --> 02:15:42.484]  And the comments of the head of the DMV, who was interviewed, by the way, by a Washington paper, and I was also in a Washington mainstream paper just last week, said that these men, talking about myself and some other men with me, presented their case very precisely and to the point, and well-spoken, well-versed in what they were saying, as opposing the real ID, on scriptural and constitutional grounds.
[02:15:42.885 --> 02:15:44.766]  So they know we're not fools,
[02:15:45.370 --> 02:15:48.392]  And I think we've earned his respect in their eyes.
[02:15:48.432 --> 02:15:52.434]  Pastor, they would never get this through if Pat Roberts wasn't supporting it.
[02:15:52.454 --> 02:15:56.116]  And he now gets on TV and says, we need national ID cards.
[02:15:56.476 --> 02:15:58.237]  He even says microchips are good.
[02:15:58.797 --> 02:16:00.938]  Well, he is part of the establishment.
[02:16:00.998 --> 02:16:02.299]  Obviously, he's a Mason.
[02:16:02.779 --> 02:16:03.760]  We know that for a fact.
[02:16:03.800 --> 02:16:05.321]  He's a part of the Sonic Lodge.
[02:16:05.621 --> 02:16:07.982]  He is absolutely on the other side.
[02:16:08.382 --> 02:16:11.384]  And I will say this on your program, my program, I don't care whose program.
[02:16:11.894 --> 02:16:17.839]  When you go to the ones who are getting the most coverage by the press, believe me, they're on the other side.
[02:16:18.860 --> 02:16:26.265]  They expose, they bring them out and put them in mainstream articles and papers saying, yeah, they're for this.
[02:16:26.285 --> 02:16:28.507]  As a matter of fact, Pat Robertson said he's for abortion.
[02:16:28.847 --> 02:16:31.610]  He believes Chinese have a right to kill their children because they're a popular baby.
[02:16:31.890 --> 02:16:33.291]  This is his own word.
[02:16:33.351 --> 02:16:37.014]  He's not just for a woman killing a baby, he is for the government doing it.
[02:16:37.114 --> 02:16:37.414]  Absolutely.
[02:16:38.755 --> 02:16:44.218]  And there's also Billy Graham coming out and saying that you don't have to know Christ to be a Christian.
[02:16:44.459 --> 02:16:45.659]  I have all this on videotape.
[02:16:45.699 --> 02:16:46.740]  I'm not making this up.
[02:16:46.820 --> 02:16:49.562]  I have Benny Hinn passing the heroin pipe around.
[02:16:49.602 --> 02:16:50.902]  His brother died the night he did that.
[02:16:50.922 --> 02:16:52.203]  I have that also on videotape.
[02:16:52.483 --> 02:17:06.692]  These are for real things, which is a little bit off topic, but nonetheless, the beast system, exposing the beast, that you offer now through your program, and thank you so much, seven hours of absolute powerful teachings by Joan Beyond,
[02:17:07.139 --> 02:17:18.088]  Dr. Bill Deagle, Dave and George from Classroom there, I'm on there, Craig Roberts from there, exposing what's going on behind the scenes to bring in Marshall Law, the Beast of Mark the Beast, I.D.
[02:17:18.128 --> 02:17:21.050]  Card is all there, and folks, you've got to get that to fit to believe it.
[02:17:21.330 --> 02:17:24.873]  And the top preachers, when it all happens, are going to say it's Jesus.
[02:17:25.133 --> 02:17:25.614]  Absolutely.
[02:17:25.634 --> 02:17:26.654]  They say we must follow...
[02:17:27.656 --> 02:17:28.877]  We're all going to be raptured
[02:17:46.255 --> 02:17:49.839]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[02:17:50.099 --> 02:17:50.960]  Look no further!
[02:17:51.260 --> 02:17:53.842]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[02:17:54.283 --> 02:18:02.791]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[02:18:02.931 --> 02:18:04.633]  You can order everything you need on the web.
[02:18:04.753 --> 02:18:05.314]  I think so.
[02:18:20.515 --> 02:18:20.915]  I don't know.
[02:18:46.218 --> 02:18:50.139]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[02:18:50.340 --> 02:19:02.624]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:19:03.044 --> 02:19:03.444]  The U.S.
[02:19:03.484 --> 02:19:09.086]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[02:19:09.467 --> 02:19:11.687]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:19:13.548 --> 02:19:14.610]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[02:19:14.630 --> 02:19:17.493]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[02:19:17.593 --> 02:19:23.640]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[02:19:24.060 --> 02:19:27.404]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[02:19:27.504 --> 02:19:33.832]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.

[02:21:50.036 --> 02:21:51.617]  This show is documented.
[02:21:52.097 --> 02:21:54.818]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:56.499 --> 02:21:58.320]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[02:21:58.360 --> 02:22:01.041]  Those of you that are holding and anybody else who wants to call in 1-800-259-9231
[02:22:05.180 --> 02:22:07.241]  Pat, Chris, David and others will get to your calls.
[02:22:08.501 --> 02:22:12.702]  Pastor Butch, last night I was up here at the office and I had your radio show on in the background.
[02:22:13.342 --> 02:22:18.583]  I heard you interviewing the gentleman who sued the government over making him use his social security number.
[02:22:18.623 --> 02:22:23.385]  He got a big settlement and now no bank will cash it without the social security number.
[02:22:23.405 --> 02:22:24.405]  But I wanted to add something here.
[02:22:25.347 --> 02:22:31.409]  The same welfare systems, the same tracking systems, the same biometrics, the same vaccine systems.
[02:22:31.809 --> 02:22:32.969]  It's global now.
[02:22:33.350 --> 02:22:37.531]  They write these laws up internationally, lobby the federal and state governments to pass them.
[02:22:38.011 --> 02:22:39.131]  It's happening everywhere.
[02:22:39.211 --> 02:22:41.272]  This control grid is going in.
[02:22:41.612 --> 02:22:46.574]  Well, the National ID card, for example, becomes law in our nation, supposedly, in January 2008.
[02:22:46.894 --> 02:22:49.655]  It also becomes law in China in 2008, January 2008.
[02:22:50.825 --> 02:22:51.626]  And in Canada, 2007.
[02:22:51.926 --> 02:22:55.528]  And that's what Tony Blair's targeting in 2008.
[02:22:56.628 --> 02:22:57.469]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:22:57.489 --> 02:22:59.250]  This is a worldwide phenomenon, folks.
[02:22:59.570 --> 02:23:02.472]  This is not... Please, you Christians out there, listen to this.
[02:23:02.752 --> 02:23:06.474]  We're trying to tell you that this is a mark-to-be system at its fullest extent.
[02:23:06.734 --> 02:23:09.856]  And they have to put the system in before they launch the really big attacks.
[02:23:10.416 --> 02:23:11.657]  That's how it works every time.
[02:23:11.897 --> 02:23:15.279]  Absolutely, and that's why I'm begging people to come to our seminar on June 3rd, Alex.
[02:23:15.339 --> 02:23:17.400]  I'm really asking and pleading with them to come.
[02:23:17.859 --> 02:23:26.487]  And I don't want to get into detail on that right now because we're running out of time, but they want more information on Seminars, June the 3rd here in West Virginia.
[02:23:26.647 --> 02:23:31.231]  They can call me toll free after we're off the air at 800-777-4403.
[02:23:31.331 --> 02:23:32.632]  That's 800-777-4403.
[02:23:32.772 --> 02:23:38.017]  Or they can go to the website pastorbutch.com and see more about it on there.
[02:23:38.798 --> 02:23:39.918]  And we'll talk to them about it.
[02:23:39.939 --> 02:23:42.201]  I want them to come because I want them to see the truth.
[02:23:42.561 --> 02:23:44.903]  This one is entitled The Reality Zone.
[02:23:45.665 --> 02:23:47.307]  Alex, that's what people don't want to face today.
[02:23:47.487 --> 02:23:49.409]  They don't want to face the reality of where we are.
[02:23:49.809 --> 02:23:53.512]  We are living in perilous times beyond our understanding.
[02:23:53.992 --> 02:24:05.722]  Even you and I, I'm convinced, as much as we are maybe more advanced than some, don't know all of it, probably because Satan's powers are not lacking in this world today to gain momentum.
[02:24:05.882 --> 02:24:09.866]  Well, you're a pastor, and in the first hour, something I talked about a few months ago came back up.
[02:24:10.470 --> 02:24:18.832]  The Chicago Tribune, the BBC, openly reporting that child kidnapping rings kidnapping hundreds and hundreds of thousands of children every few months
[02:24:19.614 --> 02:24:26.658]  openly are operating and have registered lobbyists for Halliburton and DynCorp lobbying the government not to enforce law and stop them.
[02:24:26.678 --> 02:24:27.439]  Can you imagine?
[02:24:27.799 --> 02:24:30.101]  Child kidnappers openly have lobbyists.
[02:24:30.161 --> 02:24:32.962]  It's in the Chicago Tribune and no one gets in trouble.
[02:24:33.463 --> 02:24:38.446]  And then White House Counsel John Hughes says they can torture children sexually in front of their parents.
[02:24:38.486 --> 02:24:43.049]  I mean, they're openly announcing evil that the Nazis didn't even openly announce.
[02:24:43.249 --> 02:24:48.572]  Well, and then when you and I were there protesting in public, as you mentioned, the China
[02:24:49.011 --> 02:24:55.572]  The China lady that protested Hu when he was over here was taken arrested and charged with a felony.
[02:24:55.712 --> 02:25:04.814]  They can do that and be arrested, but the other side can openly and out in public molest children and get by with that.
[02:25:04.894 --> 02:25:07.155]  Yes, this is calling good evil evil good.
[02:25:07.195 --> 02:25:12.416]  We're living in the days that was prophesied 4,000 years ago and people need to wake up to this.
[02:25:12.456 --> 02:25:13.636]  We're seeing the end
[02:25:14.184 --> 02:25:19.428]  of America as an era, if people don't repent and come back soon... Well, the Bible tells us... Well, you're right.
[02:25:19.448 --> 02:25:21.569]  The Bible tells us that Satan's the great deceiver.
[02:25:22.490 --> 02:25:28.594]  He's a master at deception, and most of the Christians I know just say, Alex, I'm glad all this is happening.
[02:25:28.634 --> 02:25:30.755]  It means I'm going to be teleported out of here soon.
[02:25:31.076 --> 02:25:33.077]  Oh, yes.
[02:25:33.357 --> 02:25:41.843]  And even if that was true, which obviously it isn't, don't they have a responsibility to defend the innocent, or is it better for them to tie a millstone around their neck?
[02:25:42.043 --> 02:25:46.035]  I can tell you this according to the scriptures and again it will be a teaching all unto itself.
[02:25:46.055 --> 02:25:47.580]  By the way, I just finished another thread.
[02:25:47.600 --> 02:25:48.202]  I updated.
[02:25:48.638 --> 02:25:49.899]  Well, you judge a tree by its fruits.
[02:26:14.279 --> 02:26:16.160]  If it is the church, it's going to fight evil.
[02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:18.642]  If it isn't fighting evil, it's the devil's church.
[02:26:19.182 --> 02:26:23.644]  Those who are sitting back waiting for the rapture, once saved, always saved, live like hell, go to heaven.
[02:26:23.684 --> 02:26:27.126]  The theology that's been taught and believed are deceiving people into hell.
[02:26:27.146 --> 02:26:29.948]  That is Satan's... Satan is so gleeful to hear that.
[02:26:30.308 --> 02:26:34.350]  I've heard it said to me hundreds, if not thousands of times, well what can I do?
[02:26:34.430 --> 02:26:35.391]  It's going to happen anyway.
[02:26:35.471 --> 02:26:36.731]  This is Bible prophecy.
[02:26:36.991 --> 02:26:37.792]  Well, it was in 1776 also.
[02:26:40.313 --> 02:26:41.855]  It was still in the same Bible then.
[02:26:41.956 --> 02:26:46.042]  Hitler, Stalin, Mao, every time the Christians thought they were about to get raptured.
[02:26:46.502 --> 02:26:52.411]  And in China, a lot of the Christians over there who believe the rapture theory,
[02:26:53.002 --> 02:26:54.823]  They were told they would not be tortured to death.
[02:26:55.064 --> 02:27:00.968]  They've lost faith in a lot of Christian teachings because they were lied to by false teachers.
[02:27:01.408 --> 02:27:06.131]  Maybe the false teachers didn't know they were teaching a lie, but nonetheless, it was still destroying them.
[02:27:06.191 --> 02:27:10.815]  It runs through the entire Old Testament news that God's people will be persecuted.
[02:27:10.875 --> 02:27:11.915]  You will be tested.
[02:27:12.075 --> 02:27:14.277]  Hosea 4-6, the people destroyed for lack of knowledge.
[02:27:15.780 --> 02:27:19.862]  But, I mean, is it not true that we are expected to be persecuted?
[02:27:19.942 --> 02:27:20.443]  Absolutely.
[02:27:20.483 --> 02:27:22.724]  That that's a mark of our master?
[02:27:22.884 --> 02:27:24.005]  It has been since the beginning.
[02:27:25.646 --> 02:27:27.047]  Alright, we'll be right back with Pastor Bush.
[02:27:27.067 --> 02:27:29.028]  We'll cover some more news and we'll take your calls.
[02:27:29.888 --> 02:27:32.890]  But I watch these TV preachers and it makes me sick.
[02:27:36.412 --> 02:27:37.313]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.793 --> 02:27:39.394]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.414 --> 02:27:42.996]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.405 --> 02:27:49.730]  And now a word from Dr. Patricia Margaitis from Stem Enhance.
[02:27:50.171 --> 02:27:54.337]  I want to first thank the wonderful GCN listeners for supporting Stem Enhance.
[02:27:54.858 --> 02:28:02.249]  Now know that your own stem cells are your body's maintenance group and Stem Enhance makes sure that more of them show up for work every day.

[02:28:07.025 --> 02:28:20.443]  If you believe there is something more for you, have a strong work ethic, and wish to participate in the monumental increase in the cost for natural health, while gaining financial independence and monthly cash flow, then you are the right person.
[02:28:20.883 --> 02:28:24.284]  I personally invite you to join me as the distributor of Stem and Hemp.

[02:29:54.973 --> 02:29:58.254]  That's why you need SFR's Protect-A Synthetic Oil Treatments.

[02:30:28.764 --> 02:30:29.024]  We're good.
[02:31:07.762 --> 02:31:10.064]  Pastor Butch, we're going to be taking some calls here in a few minutes.
[02:31:10.124 --> 02:31:14.847]  Before we do, why do the elite try to bathe us in evil?
[02:31:14.907 --> 02:31:16.909]  Why do they try to tell us that evil is good?
[02:31:16.969 --> 02:31:22.052]  Why are they constantly trying to condition us to accept total wickedness as if it's good?
[02:31:22.753 --> 02:31:25.995]  Well, that's, I think, a simple question, really.
[02:31:26.055 --> 02:31:27.736]  I hope it's a simple answer.
[02:31:28.137 --> 02:31:34.561]  Because most of the people, anyone who's never known Christ does not discern good from evil.
[02:31:34.962 --> 02:31:36.203]  According to Hebrew chapter 5,
[02:31:37.291 --> 02:31:51.334]  Last few verses, and chapter 6 of the Hebrews, even the Christians are deceived because they have not exercised their senses to be able to discern between good and evil, so therefore they fulfill the evil side and do not realize they're doing it, Alex, and that's why Satan is called the Great Deceiver.
[02:31:52.455 --> 02:31:58.876]  And the lust of the flesh, we do because we don't even understand which one is good and which one is evil.
[02:31:58.896 --> 02:32:05.818]  When you have a Christian who questions whether abortion is good or evil, is that not a deceived person?
[02:32:06.704 --> 02:32:08.945]  Well, the question was, was it being a sodomite?
[02:32:09.445 --> 02:32:11.426]  They don't like to use the word gay.
[02:32:11.446 --> 02:32:12.126]  I don't use the word gay.
[02:32:12.146 --> 02:32:12.666]  It means happy.
[02:32:12.686 --> 02:32:13.606]  It doesn't mean sodomite.
[02:32:13.886 --> 02:32:17.808]  Well, they question, well, is that good or evil according to the scripture?
[02:32:17.848 --> 02:32:35.153]  When Christians question that, and we see mainline churches, Methodist Church, the Church of Christ, other churches ordaining them to so-called preach the gospel, do you not think that obviously the flesh wants to go that way because we are ignorant of the truth?
[02:32:38.021 --> 02:32:39.482]  Butch, what do you see happening?
[02:32:39.502 --> 02:32:41.044]  I mean, you've lived a long life.
[02:32:41.084 --> 02:32:42.045]  You've seen a lot of things.
[02:32:42.505 --> 02:32:44.327]  What do you see happening in the next few years?
[02:32:44.407 --> 02:32:46.649]  Because everything really is accelerating right now.
[02:32:47.450 --> 02:32:58.279]  If there is not a repentance of, and this is 2 Chronicles 7, 14, and other places in Scripture, unless His people, and I'm talking about those who truly believe in the Creator, repent and get back on the battlefield.
[02:32:59.040 --> 02:33:01.202]  America is short-lived.
[02:33:01.462 --> 02:33:04.285]  What's left of our liberties are going to be taken shortly.
[02:33:05.021 --> 02:33:10.984]  And we're going to fulfill what I believe to be the destiny of America in our lifetime, that of the end-time Babylon.
[02:33:11.424 --> 02:33:14.926]  And I can prove that also in a lot of different places.
[02:33:15.446 --> 02:33:18.107]  But these are things, Alex, that I don't want to see happen.
[02:33:18.488 --> 02:33:22.710]  For my sake, your sake, our children's sake, your children are lovely children.
[02:33:22.810 --> 02:33:25.411]  I have three grown sons and five beautiful grandchildren.
[02:33:25.931 --> 02:33:27.112]  I want to do good.
[02:33:27.574 --> 02:33:29.615]  Well, there's also a spirit of fear.
[02:33:29.635 --> 02:33:33.376]  And I'm not saying I'm a tough guy or I've got a lot of courage.
[02:33:33.416 --> 02:33:34.417]  It isn't even courage
[02:33:54.409 --> 02:33:56.890]  When I see corruption, when I see evil, I hate it.
[02:33:57.050 --> 02:33:57.790]  I want to fight it.
[02:33:57.890 --> 02:33:58.751]  I want to resist it.
[02:33:58.791 --> 02:34:00.771]  It's a survival mechanism.
[02:34:00.831 --> 02:34:08.114]  And when I see bullies robbing somebody or picking on somebody or, you know, I become enraged.
[02:34:08.374 --> 02:34:10.095]  And that's an instinct I have in me.
[02:34:10.615 --> 02:34:11.816]  I guess you could call it a spirit.
[02:34:11.916 --> 02:34:12.656]  What is a spirit?
[02:34:12.716 --> 02:34:18.758]  And then I see the spirit of weakness and the spirit of giggling and snickering and thinking corruption is funny.
[02:34:18.778 --> 02:34:19.959]  There's nothing funny about it.
[02:34:20.319 --> 02:34:23.340]  Revelation 21, the first ones cast into hell are the
[02:34:23.948 --> 02:34:24.508]  Or the fearful.
[02:34:24.568 --> 02:34:27.010]  That doesn't mean that we enjoy being persecuted.
[02:34:27.030 --> 02:34:29.812]  It does mean that we don't fear for the flesh and the pain of the earth.
[02:34:30.172 --> 02:34:36.516]  Even Christ Himself in the garden prayed for us, be thou willed, let this cup pass from me, nevertheless not my will be done.
[02:34:36.856 --> 02:34:39.938]  We don't want to be whipped or stoned or put in prison.
[02:34:40.318 --> 02:34:44.981]  But the fearful, those who lack faith to follow their Creator, are cast into hell first.
[02:34:45.021 --> 02:34:46.602]  That's in Revelation 21.
[02:34:46.922 --> 02:34:47.963]  They can read it for themselves.
[02:34:48.371 --> 02:34:51.512]  And faith is what keeps us going strong.
[02:34:51.572 --> 02:34:52.573]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:34:53.213 --> 02:35:06.899]  What is it when you get to a point where you're not even worried about it, you don't even care anymore, you can't even control yourself, you must fight the corruption, you must fight the enslavers, because that's the point I got to over a decade ago.
[02:35:07.199 --> 02:35:08.680]  There was some fear before that.
[02:35:09.140 --> 02:35:12.521]  What is that point when you're comforted and you don't care?
[02:35:12.822 --> 02:35:16.083]  That's what Jeremiah 20, when Jeremiah spoke out himself, he said,
[02:35:16.423 --> 02:35:19.345]  He said, I've made up my mind, I'm not going to speak any more in your name.
[02:35:19.385 --> 02:35:20.646]  Talking about the Lord, of course, shall we?
[02:35:20.666 --> 02:35:20.886]  God.
[02:35:20.966 --> 02:35:22.287]  I'm not going to preach any more in your name.
[02:35:22.567 --> 02:35:24.629]  Because everyone mocks me.
[02:35:24.669 --> 02:35:28.071]  He said, this word is a fire in my bones.
[02:35:28.111 --> 02:35:29.572]  It will consume me if I don't let it out.
[02:35:29.852 --> 02:35:35.336]  So that's when you reach a point that you know that you have to speak or it will literally destroy you inside not to do it.
[02:35:35.376 --> 02:35:36.217]  The fear is gone.
[02:35:36.837 --> 02:35:40.540]  You come to the point where you no longer fear, you no longer care what the enemy thinks.
[02:35:40.922 --> 02:35:46.385]  You're going to do what's right because you serve a greater God than the God of man.
[02:35:46.666 --> 02:35:48.767]  That's why the Reading of the Seas are a series that we just finished up.
[02:35:48.787 --> 02:35:50.428]  Three hours of updated version.
[02:35:50.468 --> 02:35:51.148]  It's so important.
[02:35:51.469 --> 02:35:54.991]  Because according to scriptures, obedience is worship.
[02:35:55.330 --> 02:35:59.471]  And according to Romans 6.16, to whomever you obey, that is your God.
[02:35:59.851 --> 02:36:05.072]  And I will not, I cannot obey man's dictates for the contrary to the laws of my Creator.
[02:36:05.372 --> 02:36:08.693]  And this is Bible, and I must live by that if I expect to spend eternity with Him.
[02:36:09.053 --> 02:36:10.894]  To do otherwise will send my soul to hell.
[02:36:10.914 --> 02:36:15.875]  And Alex, I don't want to see that happen to myself, to my children, to your children, to anyone else out there.
[02:36:15.955 --> 02:36:17.175]  I want the truth brought forth.
[02:36:18.559 --> 02:36:23.588]  Well, there's certainly a real hell, but Earth itself, if we go along with evil, turns into a hell.
[02:36:33.653 --> 02:36:35.634]  They should forget God has turned into hell.
[02:36:35.974 --> 02:36:37.435]  Turn into hell!
[02:36:38.455 --> 02:36:39.756]  America is turning into hell.
[02:36:39.776 --> 02:36:44.619]  As a matter of fact, the judgment for evil, according to scripture, is more evil.
[02:36:45.139 --> 02:36:47.440]  Evil multiplies as judgment upon evil.
[02:36:47.500 --> 02:36:50.282]  Well, God gives you over to the evil.
[02:36:50.582 --> 02:36:51.142]  Absolutely.
[02:36:51.482 --> 02:36:55.244]  He gives you over to the evil and to reprobate mind, Romans chapter 1 and 2.
[02:36:55.624 --> 02:36:58.146]  You're given to reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient.
[02:36:58.166 --> 02:36:58.526]  In other words,
[02:36:59.008 --> 02:37:00.749]  Nothing bothers your conscience anymore.
[02:37:00.769 --> 02:37:01.970]  Your conscience becomes seared.
[02:37:02.330 --> 02:37:06.253]  And that's how Christians in church today can step through service after service.
[02:37:06.873 --> 02:37:10.035]  And while they're doing so, they're murdering 3,000 to 4,000 babies a day.
[02:37:10.355 --> 02:37:12.197]  They're sodomizing, marching on the streets naked.
[02:37:12.417 --> 02:37:14.998]  And the church is silent because they are reprobate.
[02:37:15.058 --> 02:37:16.459]  Their conscience has become seared.
[02:37:16.860 --> 02:37:18.220]  Nothing makes them blush anymore.
[02:37:18.240 --> 02:37:25.565]  The children of the so-called Christians dress in ways that 25, 30 years ago, the heathen didn't dress.
[02:37:26.085 --> 02:37:28.347]  This is all because our conscience has become seared.
[02:37:28.692 --> 02:37:31.974]  We are reprobate-minded in the so-called church today.
[02:37:31.994 --> 02:37:35.216]  That's why I saw Pat Robertson gets by with what he does, and the rest of them.
[02:37:35.636 --> 02:37:37.697]  We have lost our conscience.
[02:37:37.997 --> 02:37:40.138]  And because of that, we've damned our nation.
[02:37:40.178 --> 02:37:49.884]  Well, yeah, I mean, a hundred years ago, you couldn't find a large group of Americans to torture people and deal drugs and all the corrupt police and the rest of it.
[02:37:49.924 --> 02:37:50.424]  They're evil!
[02:37:50.984 --> 02:37:54.826]  The globalists had to spread evil and make us evil so they would have servants!
[02:37:55.286 --> 02:37:58.008]  And the only way that they could do that was to get to the pastors.
[02:37:58.416 --> 02:38:01.558]  Again, get them to surrender or compromise.
[02:38:01.878 --> 02:38:07.863]  I heard an old preacher one time say, that which we tolerate today, we will embrace tomorrow.
[02:38:08.703 --> 02:38:12.446]  So, compromise and toleration are the words of the day.
[02:38:12.486 --> 02:38:16.509]  We must tolerate evil to go along with it so we can do right.
[02:38:16.569 --> 02:38:17.630]  That is never scriptural.
[02:38:18.490 --> 02:38:19.911]  To love God is to hate evil.
[02:38:19.951 --> 02:38:20.912]  That's what the Bible says.
[02:38:21.727 --> 02:38:26.030]  You know, you fought for this country, or believed you did, and covered operations in Vietnam and Cambodia.
[02:38:26.391 --> 02:38:36.318]  What is it like to see tens of millions of illegal aliens wrapped in foreign flags, screaming they're going to bring America down, and then to watch our media try to spin it and say, oh, let's tolerate?
[02:38:36.498 --> 02:38:43.844]  Well, it breaks my heart beyond belief, but again, it's the familiar scripture of America, the end time Babylon, a nation of mixed peoples.
[02:38:45.661 --> 02:38:50.885]  A multi-cultural society which will never stand alone.
[02:38:51.125 --> 02:38:54.107]  There's no such thing as multi-cultural societies.
[02:38:54.328 --> 02:38:56.489]  Judge nations are always usurped.
[02:38:56.990 --> 02:38:57.550]  Absolutely.
[02:38:58.051 --> 02:38:58.651]  Absolutely.
[02:38:58.751 --> 02:39:02.494]  And to have a multi-cultural society means that you have no culture at all.
[02:39:02.814 --> 02:39:07.158]  We've lost our Christian European culture, so therefore we've lost our direction.
[02:39:07.178 --> 02:39:07.978]  We've lost our heritage.
[02:39:08.018 --> 02:39:08.799]  We've lost our roots.
[02:39:09.079 --> 02:39:14.263]  Well, I could see with that route, we're winning up and dying because we've lost... Well, that's what globalism is.
[02:39:14.323 --> 02:39:16.265]  It's knocking out every country's sovereignty.
[02:39:16.465 --> 02:39:16.845]  Absolutely.
[02:39:16.905 --> 02:39:18.347]  It's destroying every culture.
[02:39:18.387 --> 02:39:19.467]  Let's... New order.
[02:39:19.828 --> 02:39:21.309]  Let's take some calls here.
[02:39:21.329 --> 02:39:22.990]  Let's talk to Pat in Ohio.
[02:39:23.050 --> 02:39:23.951]  Pat, thanks for holding.
[02:39:23.991 --> 02:39:24.472]  Go ahead.
[02:39:24.872 --> 02:39:31.277]  Yeah, Alex, I was... My question was regarding the gentleman that's on trial.
[02:39:31.677 --> 02:39:32.818]  I think his name was Mastawi?
[02:39:33.679 --> 02:39:34.860]  Yes, the staged trial.
[02:39:35.663 --> 02:39:36.604]  Oh, you think it's a fake?
[02:39:36.684 --> 02:39:39.287]  Yes, the whole thing's been staged from the start, yes ma'am.
[02:39:39.547 --> 02:39:51.179]  Okay, how come the defense lawyers won't go to the people you know, like the International Language Department guy who said that these people were not terrorists but they were government agents?
[02:39:51.279 --> 02:39:52.761]  How come you would think he would
[02:39:54.446 --> 02:40:02.771]  You don't think court-appointed lawyers in these cases are real?
[02:40:02.831 --> 02:40:12.418]  I mean, in Oklahoma City, Stephen Jones didn't ask for the 12 surveillance camera tapes showing McVeigh with other people and showing the BATF on the ground.
[02:40:12.458 --> 02:40:13.118]  You don't think?
[02:40:13.299 --> 02:40:15.360]  I mean, number one, he said he's a patsy.
[02:40:15.400 --> 02:40:16.101]  He was set up.
[02:40:16.181 --> 02:40:17.461]  Now he changed his tune and
[02:40:18.889 --> 02:40:21.612]  Now he's obviously been tortured and he's singing like a canary.
[02:40:28.024 --> 02:40:29.265]  These people are government agents.
[02:40:29.325 --> 02:40:31.046]  It's like a hard sell to America.
[02:40:31.067 --> 02:40:33.989]  I can see how America is going down.
[02:40:34.409 --> 02:40:34.990]  Thanks for the call.
[02:40:35.410 --> 02:40:38.132]  If people think it's a hard sell or being lied to, c'est la vie.
[02:40:38.573 --> 02:40:42.896]  This is a government that admittedly claims there's WMDs.
[02:40:43.056 --> 02:40:46.839]  It's Bush says I'll arrest whoever leaked Valerie Plame's name.
[02:40:46.899 --> 02:40:49.041]  Turns out it's him.
[02:40:49.301 --> 02:40:50.622]  That's another phenomenon, Bush.
[02:40:50.902 --> 02:40:56.287]  These people lie and lie and lie and lie and lie and lie and put out fake bin Laden tapes.
[02:40:56.767 --> 02:40:58.627]  And then people still believe what they say.
[02:40:58.767 --> 02:41:05.969]  Well, the lady just called in, I don't quite understand how prevalent this conspiracy, this conspiracy is.
[02:41:06.509 --> 02:41:14.450]  Every aspect of our lives today is controlled by the world powers, if you will.
[02:41:15.050 --> 02:41:19.151]  But first he denied all this, now he admits all this.
[02:41:19.631 --> 02:41:25.212]  All this is conspired and the defense lawyers are on the side of the conspirators.
[02:41:26.078 --> 02:41:26.979]  Pat, I've got to let you go.
[02:41:26.999 --> 02:41:27.739]  Okay.
[02:41:27.899 --> 02:41:28.620]  Thank you for the call.
[02:41:29.741 --> 02:41:30.581]  That's the cue, folks.
[02:41:30.681 --> 02:41:31.442]  Let the callers go.
[02:41:34.304 --> 02:41:36.346]  I want to take a bunch of other calls here, but she brings up Ms.
[02:41:36.366 --> 02:41:36.766]  Sally.
[02:41:37.226 --> 02:41:38.107]  Here's the problem.
[02:41:38.127 --> 02:41:42.490]  You bring up an issue like this, I could talk about it for three hours and then convince people.
[02:41:43.511 --> 02:41:51.637]  Number one, the FBI agents over 50 times asked for wiretaps to search his computer and were told no.
[02:41:54.636 --> 02:42:05.344]  Their superiors, who then got the biggest cash bonuses in FBI history for covering it up, told them you'll be arrested because the FBI began to, the low-level people, began to refuse to follow orders.
[02:42:05.844 --> 02:42:08.286]  And some of them were even city chiefs, so they're not really low-level.
[02:42:09.047 --> 02:42:15.932]  Bush signed W199I, ordering the FBI and Defense Intelligence and CIA to back off of these people.
[02:42:16.884 --> 02:42:27.828]  Okay, so they needed a few patsies, so Massawi was one of their little patsies they had, one of their little provocateurs, who, you know, they didn't have involved in the so-called hijacking.
[02:42:28.168 --> 02:42:29.189]  Then they bring him in.
[02:42:29.269 --> 02:42:32.790]  Even the federal judges said that it's been a kangaroo court.
[02:42:33.647 --> 02:42:36.349]  I mean, even the Washington Post has had to say it's not a real trial.
[02:42:36.769 --> 02:42:39.211]  So if somebody's really guilty, they get a real trial.
[02:42:39.531 --> 02:42:44.675]  Now, even if his defense is real, which the evidence shows they're not, they're not even allowed to bring their own witnesses.
[02:42:44.715 --> 02:42:44.855]  Ms.
[02:42:44.895 --> 02:42:47.958]  Sally, when he did have another defense team a year ago, remember, Butch?
[02:42:48.118 --> 02:42:48.358]  Yes.
[02:42:48.518 --> 02:42:51.981]  He said, I want to call, you know, some of these government agents.
[02:42:52.041 --> 02:42:54.683]  I want to call some of these people that are in government custody.
[02:42:54.703 --> 02:42:55.844]  They're really government agents.
[02:42:55.864 --> 02:42:56.784]  Remember, he said that.
[02:42:56.864 --> 02:42:57.225]  Yes, he did.
[02:42:57.685 --> 02:43:02.108]  Then he disappears for six months and comes back and says, no, no, you know, I did it.
[02:43:02.148 --> 02:43:02.789]  It's my fault.
[02:43:03.309 --> 02:43:06.491]  I mean, a government that tortures and kills, you know they've tortured him.
[02:43:06.731 --> 02:43:08.493]  Either that or a good payoff.
[02:43:09.874 --> 02:43:13.236]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Canada.
[02:43:13.276 --> 02:43:13.896]  Chris, go ahead.
[02:43:13.916 --> 02:43:16.638]  Hi Alex, thank you so much for what you're doing.
[02:43:17.619 --> 02:43:21.041]  I read the article a few weeks back of Steve Jones from BYU.
[02:43:21.541 --> 02:43:21.802]  Yes.
[02:43:22.422 --> 02:43:22.582]  Right?
[02:43:23.143 --> 02:43:30.187]  And I called a few structural engineers because I wanted to get another opinion, an expert opinion on that paper from some universities in Canada.
[02:43:30.227 --> 02:43:31.168]  And what they did is they said,
[02:43:31.718 --> 02:43:40.101]  That they wouldn't even look at it, because they accepted the opinion of a fellow named Abolhassan Hastaneaus from Berkeley, who spoke before Congress?
[02:43:41.262 --> 02:43:42.322]  Yes, that's what happens.
[02:43:42.342 --> 02:43:46.163]  They say, we will not even do the math, we will not even look at how the buildings fell.
[02:43:46.864 --> 02:43:52.466]  But we have Kevin Ryan, who was the underwriter for Underwriter Laboratories, saying that it's impossible.
[02:43:52.846 --> 02:43:56.027]  We have all these other engineers and the heads of mining colleges saying it.
[02:43:56.807 --> 02:44:01.009]  And Professor Stephen Jones' research is conclusive.
[02:44:01.613 --> 02:44:05.075]  Well, you know, it's... and I think they're just stuck in their little library towers, is the problem.
[02:44:05.115 --> 02:44:14.239]  But I picked up the phone, I called this guy, Abolhassan Hassanals, very nice guy, and I said, I want to send you the paper and I'd like you to look at it.
[02:44:14.259 --> 02:44:15.820]  He said, well, I'm very busy, but I'll do my best.
[02:44:16.560 --> 02:44:25.305]  So I gave him a few weeks to look at it, and then when I called him, oh, and also at that time he said he thought the whole idea of it being an inside job was foolish, was ridiculous.
[02:44:25.325 --> 02:44:27.746]  And I said, well... Rob Fron, he's telling you he's got this precept.
[02:44:28.416 --> 02:44:28.976]  But you know what?
[02:44:29.436 --> 02:44:30.117]  Interesting thing.
[02:44:30.497 --> 02:44:34.839]  Now, after he said, you know what, I wish I had the time, and he's a sincere guy, I'll give him that.
[02:44:35.299 --> 02:44:37.360]  He said, I wish I had the time to properly look at it.
[02:44:37.760 --> 02:44:38.280]  And I don't.
[02:44:38.480 --> 02:44:41.721]  But, from what I've seen, now I'm 50-50 on the issue.
[02:44:42.262 --> 02:44:45.403]  This is the guy who spoke to Congress, and now he's 50-50 on the issue?
[02:44:45.863 --> 02:44:52.306]  I tell you what, and I remember seeing him and hearing him, give us his full name, we'll put you on hold, give us his phone number.
[02:44:54.206 --> 02:44:56.587]  And Alex, again, thank you so much for what you're doing.
[02:44:56.627 --> 02:44:57.968]  It's a mess up here in Canada, too.
[02:44:58.542 --> 02:45:02.185]  And nobody gives a crap, it seems, about what's happening to this world.
[02:45:02.225 --> 02:45:04.787]  I will.
[02:45:05.488 --> 02:45:06.549]  Do you have his number in front of you?
[02:45:07.109 --> 02:45:08.190]  I will get it in two seconds.
[02:45:08.671 --> 02:45:11.573]  Okay, we're going to put Chris on hold.
[02:45:12.674 --> 02:45:15.256]  Scott, get that name and info from him.
[02:45:15.276 --> 02:45:15.536]  That's big.
[02:45:17.308 --> 02:45:21.271]  Let's go ahead and talk to David in Georgia.
[02:45:21.331 --> 02:45:22.192]  David, you're on the air.
[02:45:22.452 --> 02:45:23.633]  Hey Alex, how are you doing today?
[02:45:23.793 --> 02:45:24.013]  Good.
[02:45:24.434 --> 02:45:31.539]  I'm calling in regards to, I've called in a couple months ago, I'm one of the soldiers that have been called back after serving prior service.
[02:45:31.579 --> 02:45:32.079]  That's right.
[02:45:32.379 --> 02:45:40.585]  And I'm pretty happy to say that I'm not reporting and I've already missed my report date and I'm actually going through the process right now of administrative separation.
[02:45:40.626 --> 02:45:43.808]  But I'm not calling about me, I'm actually calling about a gentleman
[02:45:44.028 --> 02:45:45.929]  Let me back up for those that don't know.
[02:45:46.409 --> 02:45:54.471]  Soldiers who served two, three, and even four tours overseas, we didn't even do this in World War II or Vietnam, are being forced to re-up.
[02:45:54.791 --> 02:45:57.432]  It's a draft of those that have already served.
[02:45:57.452 --> 02:45:59.753]  I want to get Butch's comment on that, then you can finish up.
[02:45:59.933 --> 02:46:00.173]  Okay.
[02:46:00.413 --> 02:46:01.393]  Alright, I will say this.
[02:46:01.654 --> 02:46:12.337]  I don't know how old you are, sir, but I know for a fact that calling men back in in the 50s and 60s who are specialized in different, we'll say doctors, maybe physicians,
[02:46:12.737 --> 02:46:13.217]  Right, okay.
[02:46:41.480 --> 02:46:49.423]  Well, the real reason I called Alex is, um, there's a family that I think we really need to get behind, and this is, uh, Sergeant Kevin Binderman, and I just want to give you a story real quick.
[02:46:49.883 --> 02:46:52.905]  He, uh, served 10 years in the Army and just got back from Iraq in 2004.
[02:46:53.265 --> 02:46:58.707]  He was supposed to get out in 2005, but because of stop loss, they prevented him to leave.
[02:46:59.167 --> 02:47:10.932]  At that point, he filed for conscientious objector and was denied that, and the commander of his base wouldn't even look at the information, and at this point in time, he's actually serving 18 months in prison, and if I can, I just want to give out a website of
[02:47:11.332 --> 02:47:16.556]  BendermanDefense.org and anybody who can get behind this family's cause, please do.
[02:47:16.616 --> 02:47:19.718]  I know we've got Cynthia McKinney support and anybody who can help would be really great.
[02:47:19.738 --> 02:47:23.360]  Well, I want people, and I'm familiar with Mr. Bender's case, think about it.
[02:47:23.380 --> 02:47:25.442]  You serve multiple years over there.
[02:47:26.222 --> 02:47:33.167]  They engage in fraud with your contract, make you stay in there, and I hear neocons call into shows and go, yeah, put them in jail.
[02:47:33.207 --> 02:47:35.368]  They need to... I thought we support the troops.
[02:47:35.388 --> 02:47:36.449]  71% want to come home.
[02:47:36.469 --> 02:47:37.550]  71% say the war is a fraud, Butch.
[02:47:41.258 --> 02:47:41.879]  Absolutely.
[02:47:42.700 --> 02:47:45.142]  As a matter of fact, desertions are at a record level.
[02:47:45.462 --> 02:47:54.671]  I get emails from people in Iraq, serving soldiers, that email me and tell me that there's nothing fair about this, that we're murderers, and we know this.
[02:47:54.871 --> 02:47:59.095]  In Vietnam, we knew this also, but I was naive enough to think back then, because we've
[02:47:59.574 --> 02:48:05.576]  So much even back then when you were covering operations in Cambodia, you knew about the drugs but made some excuse to yourself?
[02:48:23.877 --> 02:48:27.901]  And that's why Butch isn't naive public, like some of you out there, because he's lived.
[02:48:28.402 --> 02:48:31.845]  And the more you see of the underbelly, you figure out the underbelly is in control.
[02:48:32.606 --> 02:48:38.211]  Thanks for the call, David, Sean, and Frank, last callers.
[02:48:38.231 --> 02:48:39.453]  All I have time for are you.
[02:48:39.473 --> 02:48:45.679]  And don't forget I'm carrying Butch's new, what, almost 7-hour video, The Beast Exposed, at InfoWars.com.
[02:48:47.344 --> 02:48:50.186]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:50.467 --> 02:48:52.028]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:52.368 --> 02:48:57.052]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:57.393 --> 02:49:01.816]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:49:02.237 --> 02:49:06.460]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:06.660 --> 02:49:09.503]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.583 --> 02:49:12.085]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[02:49:12.265 --> 02:49:14.207]  But the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:14.447 --> 02:49:18.851]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:19.091 --> 02:49:26.317]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[02:49:46.798 --> 02:49:48.439]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:49:48.559 --> 02:49:52.660]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:49:52.800 --> 02:49:55.681]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:49:55.761 --> 02:50:02.423]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:50:02.643 --> 02:50:05.647]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:50:05.867 --> 02:50:08.230]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:50:08.370 --> 02:50:18.543]  Black-Murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as actazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[02:50:18.703 --> 02:50:27.848]  MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[02:50:28.008 --> 02:50:35.773]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:51:32.671 --> 02:51:35.772]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.

[02:52:31.076 --> 02:52:34.437]  I want to jam in two final calls, Butch, but you intrigue me with the Vietnam stuff.
[02:52:34.457 --> 02:52:35.558]  You hardly ever talk about that.
[02:52:35.998 --> 02:52:40.120]  When you were in Nam, you knew about how they were shipping the heroin back in the dead bodies?
[02:52:40.160 --> 02:52:41.500]  Yes, and by the way, I wasn't in Cambodia.
[02:52:41.580 --> 02:52:42.681]  I was in Laos a lot.
[02:52:42.701 --> 02:52:43.161]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[02:52:43.201 --> 02:52:44.401]  I always get that mixed up.
[02:52:44.561 --> 02:52:53.685]  But yes, we knew they were putting drugs in body bags and stacking them up like wood bodies and shipping them out in CIA.
[02:52:54.335 --> 02:52:55.456]  Uh, covert action planes.
[02:52:55.516 --> 02:52:57.217]  I mean, uh, Air America is for real, folks.
[02:52:57.257 --> 02:52:58.378]  There's no joke.
[02:52:58.438 --> 02:52:58.898]  It's for real.
[02:52:59.058 --> 02:53:00.659]  So you witnessed that or you heard about it?
[02:53:00.719 --> 02:53:05.642]  No, I was on the base in Udon, Thailand where they did it.
[02:53:05.682 --> 02:53:06.643]  This is for real stuff.
[02:53:06.683 --> 02:53:07.624]  This is no lie.
[02:53:07.664 --> 02:53:08.464]  This actually happened.
[02:53:09.145 --> 02:53:11.546]  I've got to get you back on sometime to talk about that.
[02:53:12.127 --> 02:53:14.488]  I mean, these are the things that we knew.
[02:53:14.628 --> 02:53:17.650]  And I was a, well, I won't say I was high ranking at all.
[02:53:17.670 --> 02:53:18.811]  I was a peon, I guess.
[02:53:18.831 --> 02:53:19.912]  I was only a sergeant.
[02:53:19.932 --> 02:53:20.472]  But nonetheless,
[02:53:21.328 --> 02:53:32.334]  I was in the area where it was done, and I was in the operations, in the communications where this type of thing happened a lot.
[02:53:33.334 --> 02:53:38.457]  And we did this, actually the war in Vietnam was about oil and drugs also.
[02:53:39.778 --> 02:53:43.780]  It was not about... Did you ever actually witness the bodies as they were putting the drugs in?
[02:53:44.100 --> 02:53:46.201]  No, no, the bodies were not in there at all.
[02:53:46.241 --> 02:53:48.142]  Just body bags stuffed with drugs.
[02:53:50.475 --> 02:53:53.516]  Unbelievable, but you witnessed physically, you saw the heroin?
[02:53:53.656 --> 02:53:58.698]  I saw the bags being loaded, yes, the bags and stuff with the drugs and loaded on planes.
[02:53:59.118 --> 02:53:59.698]  Unbelievable.
[02:53:59.778 --> 02:54:02.439]  Sean, in New Hampshire, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:54:03.019 --> 02:54:04.419]  Hi Alex, great to be on the show.
[02:54:05.180 --> 02:54:12.182]  It looks like New Hampshire is passing HB 1582 in the Senate and we will be the first state to reject the LIG Act.
[02:54:14.009 --> 02:54:17.630]  For those that missed it, you guys are rejecting the National ID Card.
[02:54:17.970 --> 02:54:19.830]  West Virginia and many others are very close.
[02:54:20.431 --> 02:54:24.612]  Yes, and... What was the hospital being shown?
[02:54:24.792 --> 02:54:25.092]  HB 1582?
[02:54:25.212 --> 02:54:26.112]  It is HB 1582.
[02:54:26.292 --> 02:54:27.052]  Okay, Doc, thank you.
[02:54:27.652 --> 02:54:30.033]  And we're going to reject the National ID Card.
[02:54:30.133 --> 02:54:38.535]  Also, I wanted to mention, Alex, I was talking to a psychiatrist whose patients are coming in and their number one problem is that they're depressed over the country and the things that are going on.
[02:54:39.128 --> 02:54:44.049]  And I've given her your information and stuff and she, her number one prescription now is resistance.
[02:54:45.190 --> 02:54:45.910]  It feels good.
[02:54:45.930 --> 02:54:47.270]  It's a lot better than Prozac.
[02:54:47.750 --> 02:54:48.271]  Amen.
[02:54:48.731 --> 02:54:50.131]  Sean, I couldn't think of a better caller.
[02:54:50.171 --> 02:54:51.171]  Thanks for that good news.
[02:54:51.551 --> 02:54:53.132]  Frank in Washington, last caller.
[02:54:53.172 --> 02:54:53.632]  Go ahead.
[02:54:54.452 --> 02:54:55.653]  Hey, Alex.
[02:54:55.773 --> 02:54:57.173]  Thanks for the call.
[02:54:57.633 --> 02:55:03.295]  I just wanted to point out a couple things to you that I come across here searching the internet.
[02:55:03.455 --> 02:55:04.015]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:55:04.635 --> 02:55:06.676]  One thing was, okay, I was looking for Chavez.
[02:55:08.326 --> 02:55:18.869]  And so in the Boston Globe, they have him having a kind of a reduction for heating oil for poor folks up there in the Northeast.
[02:55:19.589 --> 02:55:25.051]  Yeah, he gave us at 40% its cost, heating oil, so he's evil.
[02:55:25.571 --> 02:55:34.754]  And then, yeah, and then the second thing that I saw after looking at that was, did you see the Stansberry and Associates article or whatever it is?
[02:55:35.391 --> 02:55:35.852]  Uh, no.
[02:55:36.372 --> 02:55:37.753]  Oh God, this is comedy.
[02:55:38.093 --> 02:55:41.956]  It says the United States could become the new Middle East by the U.N.S.
[02:55:42.296 --> 02:55:43.897]  Energy Department survey.
[02:55:44.437 --> 02:55:47.820]  They said that they found oil underneath the Colorado Mountains.
[02:55:48.980 --> 02:55:51.042]  I was like, that's... okay.
[02:55:51.142 --> 02:55:52.803]  We've got all we need in Alaska right now.
