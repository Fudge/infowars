[00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.690]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.451]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.451 --> 00:00:10.211]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.211 --> 00:00:11.792]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.792 --> 00:00:13.332]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.332 --> 00:00:17.493]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.493 --> 00:00:23.795]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.795 --> 00:00:25.575]  Let's go right to your calls.
[00:00:25.575 --> 00:00:28.256]  Let's go to Neil in Canada.
[00:00:28.256 --> 00:00:29.176]  Farming and prepping.
[00:00:29.176 --> 00:00:30.237]  That sounds evil.
[00:00:30.237 --> 00:00:30.757]  Go ahead, Neil.
[00:00:31.812 --> 00:00:36.035]  Yeah, I'm calling from Canada, as I said.
[00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:37.816]  Anyway, I'm a little nervous.
[00:00:37.816 --> 00:00:42.979]  I haven't called on air the first time.
[00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:49.304]  Yes, I was watching a movie that I downloaded last night.
[00:00:49.304 --> 00:00:51.105]  Have you ever heard of Michael Rupert?
[00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:58.720]  Yeah, I watched his film about his take on 9-11.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.902]  It sounded very convincing that that's how it probably happened.
[00:01:02.902 --> 00:01:06.023]  And he's a bit more of a pessimist.
[00:01:06.023 --> 00:01:09.224]  He just says, basically, it's going to happen.
[00:01:09.224 --> 00:01:10.464]  Get prepared.
[00:01:10.464 --> 00:01:11.084]  Get ready.
[00:01:11.084 --> 00:01:12.705]  It's going to happen.
[00:01:14.494 --> 00:01:16.457]  I guess I have more take on his side.
[00:01:16.457 --> 00:01:21.124]  I'm not saying that what you guys do is not helpful.
[00:01:21.124 --> 00:01:24.669]  I think, if anything, you're slowing down the New World Order crowd.
[00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:25.670]  You're slowing them down.
[00:01:26.624 --> 00:01:28.225]  Yeah, well, here's the deal.
[00:01:28.225 --> 00:01:31.388]  Mike's an interesting fellow.
[00:01:31.388 --> 00:01:37.352]  My issue is he thinks everything's going to collapse because our world's unsustainable.
[00:01:37.352 --> 00:01:40.014]  Well, the globalists are artificially collapsing it.
[00:01:40.014 --> 00:01:49.702]  Sure, there's some problems with our industrial society, and it could be cleaner and better, but they're just opportunistically, the globalists are, using that as Agenda 21 to implode things.
[00:01:50.482 --> 00:01:58.469]  And so they push the whole peak oil thing and the rest of it, while they try to shut off coal, while they try to build more nuclear, which is just crazy.
[00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.774]  So, you know, that's my take on it, is that it is globalist propaganda, the whole peak oil thing.
[00:02:04.774 --> 00:02:09.137]  That doesn't mean somebody's bad or somebody's an agent, if they believe it.
[00:02:09.137 --> 00:02:17.364]  It just means I disagree with them, and I know where that worldview originated from.
[00:02:17.364 --> 00:02:18.805]  And it originated from the globalists.
[00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:19.446]  You see what I'm saying?
[00:02:21.431 --> 00:02:24.755]  I would rather be safe than sorry.
[00:02:24.755 --> 00:02:27.298]  I'm on a fixed income.
[00:02:27.298 --> 00:02:28.099]  I can't help it.
[00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.242]  I'm on disability up here in Canada.
[00:02:31.242 --> 00:02:33.805]  I'm going to do what little I can, incrementally.
[00:02:33.805 --> 00:02:36.008]  Hopefully the collapse won't happen very soon.
[00:02:36.008 --> 00:02:36.869]  If it does at all.
[00:02:39.964 --> 00:02:43.947]  I just want to be ready for if and when it happens.
[00:02:43.947 --> 00:02:46.389]  Canada is run by the Queen and her Governor General.
[00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:55.936]  Other than social engineering and destroying the family and domesticating people, Canada is probably one of the safer zones to be in.
[00:02:55.936 --> 00:02:59.119]  It's an incredible police state with a velvet glove on it.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:09.589]  Very authoritarian, but for the general energy units, the human resource units, known as humans there, it'll be one of the better zones.
[00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:15.034]  The Globalist plans civil war and mass re-education and extermination here in the U.S.
[00:03:15.034 --> 00:03:15.775]  if they get their way.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.341]  I don't know if they're going to send us to camps.
[00:03:19.341 --> 00:03:21.582]  I don't even know if there are camps in Canada.
[00:03:21.582 --> 00:03:26.305]  Oh yeah, you have emergency relocation centers that operates as the cover for internment facilities.
[00:03:26.305 --> 00:03:27.285]  That's on record.
[00:03:27.285 --> 00:03:28.946]  And you are under NORTHCOM.
[00:03:28.946 --> 00:03:35.990]  You are under a EU-American Union bilateral 2007 NORTHCOM agreement.
[00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.971]  So you're actually under NORTHCOM.
[00:03:37.971 --> 00:03:44.234]  You're in the military jurisdiction of the Sachs-Coburg-Gotha-Rothschild-Rockefeller Combine.
[00:03:46.941 --> 00:03:54.347]  Yeah, I was wondering, what if the U.S.
[00:03:54.347 --> 00:04:03.935]  economy does implode, which we do believe it likely will happen, would our dollar become just as worthless as yours?
[00:04:05.034 --> 00:04:06.655]  No.
[00:04:06.655 --> 00:04:08.557]  But it will be devalued.
[00:04:08.557 --> 00:04:13.000]  And that's a probability scenario.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.682]  Again, you're fully captured.
[00:04:15.682 --> 00:04:21.166]  And so, again, you've never really resisted the New World Order.
[00:04:21.166 --> 00:04:24.229]  So you'll be murdered later.
[00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:34.597]  The United States, after they're done using us as the empire, is to be absolutely decimated and the population implanted with diseases and cancer and just slaughtered up one side and down the other.
[00:04:36.231 --> 00:04:43.256]  Well it's more like, I don't know if any of those pepper books have anything about more all natural farming, like 19th century farming.
[00:04:43.256 --> 00:04:52.743]  It's wonderful, it's wonderful, and globalists are targeting it everywhere, while saying they like it out of one side of their mouth, savagely releasing bureaucrats worldwide to attack it any way they can.
[00:04:52.743 --> 00:04:55.345]  They see any natural human activity as the enemy.
[00:04:55.345 --> 00:04:58.648]  They want you dead after they suck the energy out of you.
[00:04:58.648 --> 00:04:59.869]  They see you as a human resource.
[00:05:00.817 --> 00:05:06.321]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[00:05:06.321 --> 00:05:08.723]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:05:08.723 --> 00:05:17.829]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure, and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:05:17.829 --> 00:05:21.292]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[00:05:21.292 --> 00:05:22.973]  There's no priming required.
[00:05:22.973 --> 00:05:25.235]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[00:05:25.235 --> 00:05:27.756]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[00:05:28.817 --> 00:05:30.318]  Easy to set up and use.
[00:05:30.318 --> 00:05:31.759]  Doesn't require electricity.
[00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:34.901]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:38.304]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:05:38.304 --> 00:05:42.447]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:05:42.447 --> 00:05:45.189]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:46.750]  It's what my family uses.
[00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.072]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.

[00:06:01.961 --> 00:06:07.565]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[00:06:07.565 --> 00:06:10.808]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[00:06:10.808 --> 00:06:13.610]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.632]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[00:06:16.632 --> 00:06:19.635]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[00:06:20.135 --> 00:06:25.342]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[00:06:25.342 --> 00:06:28.005]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.
[00:06:28.005 --> 00:06:31.669]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:35.433]  I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.
[00:06:35.433 --> 00:06:39.058]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials.

[00:06:51.731 --> 00:06:54.854]  Would you rather prepare six months too early or one day too late?
[00:06:54.854 --> 00:06:56.536]  409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:07:00.385 --> 00:07:03.406]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[00:07:03.406 --> 00:07:08.408]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:07:08.408 --> 00:07:15.591]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:07:15.731 --> 00:07:21.376]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:07:21.376 --> 00:07:25.400]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.124]  We've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.

[00:07:35.549 --> 00:07:38.812]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[00:07:38.812 --> 00:07:41.314]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[00:07:41.314 --> 00:07:46.077]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[00:07:46.077 --> 00:07:48.959]  Hand-cranked shortwave AM FM radios.

[00:07:56.185 --> 00:07:57.446]  We're getting prepared.
[00:07:57.446 --> 00:07:58.126]  Are you?
[00:07:58.126 --> 00:07:58.907]  Infowarshop.com
[00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:10.745]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:10.745 --> 00:08:12.326]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.326 --> 00:08:13.887]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.887 --> 00:08:18.070]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:25.195]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:25.195 --> 00:08:29.338]  I remember, well, interviewing him more than a decade ago, and so much of what he first
[00:08:30.461 --> 00:08:31.222]  We're good to go.
[00:08:53.238 --> 00:09:14.184]  At least he has been in the past, and he is just a trailblazer who speaks to giant packed houses all over the country and the world, to medical doctors, and he has just pioneered so much of what we now know about chronic inflammation in the brain, from vaccines, you name it, Dr. Russell Blaylock,
[00:09:14.844 --> 00:09:19.989]  He is a registered board certified neurosurgeon and a best-selling author.
[00:09:19.989 --> 00:09:27.736]  He is a former clinical assistant professor of neurosurgery at the University of Mississippi Medical Center.
[00:09:27.736 --> 00:09:35.183]  He is the author of a number of books and numerous scientific papers and articles including excitotoxins, the taste that kills,
[00:09:35.883 --> 00:09:38.426]  I'm not going to go through all of his incredible bio.
[00:09:58.072 --> 00:10:11.471]  In the second part of the interview this hour, we'll get into vaccines damaging the brain, these low cholesterol diets, what that's doing on top of the statins, some stuff that can really help people.
[00:10:11.471 --> 00:10:14.254]  Because I'm starting to hear this in mainline radio, mainline news.
[00:10:15.117 --> 00:10:19.601]  And folks, we need to appreciate Trailblazers.
[00:10:19.601 --> 00:10:28.570]  Because I remember when he was on three and a half years ago, during the fake H1N1, saying it's all fake, it'll increase your chances of getting the flu, it's gonna actually hurt people.
[00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:31.713]  All of that a year later came out in Canadian, German studies.
[00:10:33.277 --> 00:10:38.478]  But he got attacked by the national media for coming on this show and for talking about it.
[00:10:38.478 --> 00:10:57.203]  And the point is, is this is a guy who full-time tries to warn people and who's going out, and because we've sent people to interview him, you know, in big cities where there's, you know, 2,000 doctors packing the room, sold out, to where we can't even get seats, but we're in the back videotaping it, you know, so we can come back and show it to you here on the news when he breaks down.
[00:10:57.683 --> 00:11:03.466]  And he is one of the unsung revolutionaries that's going to lead the new renaissance out of this.
[00:11:03.466 --> 00:11:06.647]  So when we talk about stuff for Alzheimer's, this is one of the leading experts.
[00:11:06.647 --> 00:11:07.467]  You better listen.
[00:11:07.467 --> 00:11:16.591]  The medical establishment is ignorant at the low level, but on top, the system does not want you to know about these treatments that are incredible.
[00:11:16.591 --> 00:11:17.512]  So I've said that.
[00:11:17.512 --> 00:11:23.414]  The reason I want to get him on in the first part of the interview, we'll show viewers, if you're radio listeners, this is up at InfoWars.com.
[00:11:25.735 --> 00:11:34.157]  CEO sees Obama health law doubling some premiums.
[00:11:34.157 --> 00:11:38.639]  Health insurance premiums may as much as double for some small businesses.
[00:11:38.639 --> 00:11:40.879]  Aetna CEO is saying this.
[00:11:40.879 --> 00:11:47.641]  Health insurance premiums may as much as double for some small businesses and individual buyers in the U.S.
[00:11:47.641 --> 00:11:50.282]  when the Affordable Care Act's major provisions kick in.
[00:11:51.294 --> 00:11:53.376]  And that is what their chief executive said.
[00:11:53.376 --> 00:11:54.377]  Here's another one.
[00:11:54.377 --> 00:11:54.977]  LA Times.
[00:11:54.977 --> 00:11:58.000]  Blue Shield of California seeks rate hike of 20%.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.083]  And then another 20% in 2014.
[00:12:01.083 --> 00:12:04.926]  Folks, my dad manages, he corrected me, I said a dozen.
[00:12:04.926 --> 00:12:08.189]  I always just say a dozen when I know it's something like that.
[00:12:08.189 --> 00:12:09.210]  18 dental offices.
[00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:12.213]  But he also manages a bunch of other healthcare stuff, non-dental.
[00:12:12.213 --> 00:12:14.355]  I'm not going to get into it, but he's a dentist, oral surgeon.
[00:12:15.646 --> 00:12:21.712]  Everything Dr. Blaylock told us about Obamacare three years ago is exactly what my dad says, but now it's happening.
[00:12:21.712 --> 00:12:24.695]  Two big medical groups just shut down the United States.
[00:12:24.695 --> 00:12:26.196]  They're just shutting down in Texas.
[00:12:26.196 --> 00:12:28.899]  They're just not going to operate now.
[00:12:28.899 --> 00:12:32.362]  Most of the dentists he knows, some of them that are 50 years old, they got 20 years in them.
[00:12:32.362 --> 00:12:33.363]  They're just retiring.
[00:12:33.363 --> 00:12:33.804]  They're done.
[00:12:36.079 --> 00:12:41.282]  I'm going to have Dr. Blaylock have the floor here and tell you what this is going to do.
[00:12:41.282 --> 00:12:43.744]  Of course, the government knows it's going to wreck health care.
[00:12:43.744 --> 00:12:44.585]  Then they take it over.
[00:12:44.585 --> 00:12:46.746]  The insurance companies wrote this.
[00:12:46.746 --> 00:12:49.748]  It doesn't cover pre-existing, all the fools that they get a free lunch.
[00:12:49.748 --> 00:12:53.491]  It lets the government say through a computer what treatments you can give.
[00:12:53.491 --> 00:12:55.592]  And that's why doctors are just, I'm done.
[00:12:55.592 --> 00:12:57.613]  I'm not going to have a death panel.
[00:12:57.613 --> 00:12:58.254]  That's what it is.
[00:12:58.254 --> 00:13:00.575]  As Bill Gates said, call it a death panel.
[00:13:00.575 --> 00:13:00.916]  We need it.
[00:13:02.097 --> 00:13:03.899]  The government now runs our health care.
[00:13:03.899 --> 00:13:04.700]  The government.
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.863]  The IRS now gets your health records.
[00:13:06.863 --> 00:13:10.767]  Nixon was going to go to jail for having IRS records and he's the president.
[00:13:10.767 --> 00:13:15.073]  Now it's just on the books that the giant bureaucracy has it.
[00:13:16.107 --> 00:13:17.067]  I'm going to shut up now.
[00:13:17.067 --> 00:13:19.368]  Sir, go over it all for us here.
[00:13:19.368 --> 00:13:22.229]  And now people are seeing this wasn't rhetoric.
[00:13:22.229 --> 00:13:28.591]  The fools out there now are going to see a doubling in the next few years of their health care costs.
[00:13:28.591 --> 00:13:31.612]  Because an industry now can force you to buy their product.
[00:13:31.612 --> 00:13:32.192]  Dr. Blaylock.
[00:13:33.413 --> 00:13:34.814]  Well, you're exactly right.
[00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:42.878]  And of course, what people need to understand, this isn't new, this wasn't created under the Obama administration, this wasn't in the last 10 years.
[00:13:42.878 --> 00:13:48.641]  They have been working on this for over half a century.
[00:13:48.641 --> 00:13:52.823]  These people have been obsessed with taking over medical care.
[00:13:53.163 --> 00:14:07.307]  Because medical care is such a huge segment of the economy, it's important to control people, it's important if you want to control populations, if they want to implement their ideas, which you can read about.
[00:14:07.307 --> 00:14:17.249]  Many years ago, back in 1910, they were talking about controlling births, killing off old people because they were
[00:14:17.569 --> 00:14:19.930]  No longer useful to society.
[00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:24.611]  So all this was in the plans and they've been working on it all of this time.
[00:14:24.611 --> 00:14:31.394]  Now, as a physician, we saw it much earlier than everyone else because they did it incrementally.
[00:14:31.394 --> 00:14:35.955]  And 20, 30 years ago, I was fighting this when I was in practice.
[00:14:35.955 --> 00:14:46.819]  My fellow physicians, I had more opposition from the fellow physicians than I did the enemies in government and other places, the liberal left who wanted this.
[00:14:47.559 --> 00:14:50.502]  You fell a physician who was fighting you the most.
[00:14:50.502 --> 00:15:08.980]  The reason was they thought, well, you know, we're pretty smart guys and I think if we just work with them, we just let them know that we'll help them save cost and we'll be reasonable in what we do, then they're going to come around and say, okay, that's all we wanted you to do is be reasonable.
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:10.342]  I told these physician,
[00:15:10.882 --> 00:15:20.207]  I said, you don't understand socialism and collectivism and you haven't read these papers written by these designers, these elitist social engineers.
[00:15:20.207 --> 00:15:22.348]  They don't care whether you're reasonable or not.
[00:15:22.348 --> 00:15:25.629]  Their intention is total, absolute control.
[00:15:25.629 --> 00:15:27.870]  Well, we've arrived.
[00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:28.331]  We're here now.
[00:15:29.131 --> 00:15:36.714]  Now, the purpose of doubling premiums and private insurance is to force you into the government total control.
[00:15:36.714 --> 00:15:37.635]  And you said that.
[00:15:37.635 --> 00:15:38.255]  You said that.
[00:15:38.255 --> 00:15:40.036]  It's meant to bankrupt the system.
[00:15:40.036 --> 00:15:46.238]  And for those that don't know, they're going after former state medical board doctors and people, the states and the feds.
[00:15:46.238 --> 00:15:54.082]  For those that don't know, they're arresting and harassing doctors everywhere that give you the care you need when they don't follow what the computer tells them to do.
[00:15:55.123 --> 00:16:00.608]  Well, some of the cases are just unbelievable of the abuse of the physician.
[00:16:00.608 --> 00:16:07.195]  Because the physician was handed a group of rules when you joined Medicare or Medicaid.
[00:16:07.195 --> 00:16:12.220]  And the rules, of course, like all social systems that draw you in, at first are lax.
[00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.141]  They're not enforced.
[00:16:13.681 --> 00:16:23.152]  And then once you're hooked, then they start increasing the number of regulations, the number of laws, and then they start picking positions to make examples of.
[00:16:23.152 --> 00:16:26.015]  Well, we've reached a lot of those cases now.
[00:16:26.015 --> 00:16:34.105]  There's a case that's just recently reported in which a 63-year-old vascular surgeon was targeted.
[00:16:34.645 --> 00:16:37.687]  And they examined over 4,000 of his records.
[00:16:37.687 --> 00:16:44.170]  They found two records in which they said, well, you know, some of your language is not proper.
[00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:48.272]  He left out a two, T-O.
[00:16:48.272 --> 00:16:53.595]  And his coding for five patients was challenged by the federal government.
[00:16:53.595 --> 00:17:03.821]  Now, if you don't understand medical coding, everything a doctor does to the most minor procedure in the office, to the most complex surgery,
[00:17:04.401 --> 00:17:17.468]  As a CPT code, the government code, which has to do with reimbursement, you're told as a physician everything you do in which you bill the government has to have a CPT code.
[00:17:17.468 --> 00:17:24.851]  Well, the problem is there are tens of thousands of procedures for which there's no CPT code.
[00:17:24.851 --> 00:17:27.053]  So when we ask, well, what do we do about that?
[00:17:27.053 --> 00:17:29.274]  They say, well, just code it as close as you can.
[00:17:30.054 --> 00:17:32.095]  Physicians took them at their word.
[00:17:32.095 --> 00:17:36.336]  Well, now they've decided we need some examples of physician abuse.
[00:17:36.336 --> 00:17:39.137]  So they target people like this vascular surgeon.
[00:17:39.137 --> 00:17:43.778]  They said, you've coded improperly and we're going to put you in jail.
[00:17:43.778 --> 00:17:50.300]  And of course, he's gotten a sentence of 10 months in prison defrauding the federal government.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.541]  Now, did he defraud the government?
[00:17:52.541 --> 00:17:54.521]  Well, this is the interesting thing about the law.
[00:17:54.521 --> 00:18:01.004]  The law says we don't have to show that you intended in any way to defraud the government.
[00:18:01.004 --> 00:18:06.205]  Just making an error is evidence of fraud and abuse.
[00:18:06.205 --> 00:18:09.166]  And that's why all these companies are even getting out of the business now.
[00:18:09.166 --> 00:18:11.527]  The big mega insiders are left alone.
[00:18:11.527 --> 00:18:15.389]  It's the smaller and medium-sized companies can be white glove inspected.
[00:18:15.389 --> 00:18:17.029]  There's no way to operate.
[00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:18.970]  That's why these companies are just shutting down.
[00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:23.811]  Successful, providing good care, profitable, they're just shutting down.
[00:18:23.811 --> 00:18:28.073]  Which again, the socialists know, that will bankrupt the whole system.
[00:18:28.073 --> 00:18:30.473]  And then you'll be forced into total government control.
[00:18:30.473 --> 00:18:32.934]  That's right, and that's what they want.
[00:18:32.934 --> 00:18:35.495]  You know, socialism is about control.
[00:18:35.495 --> 00:18:37.676]  People need to understand that.
[00:18:37.676 --> 00:18:43.438]  All these people that are excited about socialism and collectivism, it's about human control.
[00:18:43.438 --> 00:18:44.578]  You're told what to do.
[00:18:44.578 --> 00:18:47.559]  If you don't, and you're not obedient, you're going to be punished.
[00:18:47.979 --> 00:18:51.560]  They make that quite plain, and this is what the physicians are learning now.
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:59.161]  I told them that 20 years ago, they didn't believe it, now they're going to prison for very long terms.
[00:18:59.161 --> 00:19:01.781]  10 years, 20 years.
[00:19:01.781 --> 00:19:04.022]  Ruining their life, taking their license away.
[00:19:04.022 --> 00:19:06.422]  And by the way, I hear that exact talk for a decade.
[00:19:06.422 --> 00:19:12.403]  You know, the doctors in the company say, we're just going to work with them and be reasonable and we're sure we'll be alright.
[00:19:12.403 --> 00:19:13.844]  No, there's no way out.
[00:19:13.844 --> 00:19:15.624]  You're being mafia taken over.
[00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:27.455]  And they're targeting these people and destroying their reputations, destroying their life, put them in prison with common criminals, and you could be killed in prison.
[00:19:27.455 --> 00:19:31.757]  And I have cases of physicians in which they purposely tried to do that.
[00:19:31.757 --> 00:19:34.919]  They moved them across the country so they couldn't be near their families.
[00:19:35.519 --> 00:19:41.903]  You know, this is just stuff right out of the Soviet Union and Communist China that we're seeing implemented.
[00:19:41.903 --> 00:19:46.165]  Yeah, they're targeting the intelligentsia that has served the system so well.
[00:19:46.165 --> 00:19:51.608]  They're now just a high-tech lynching, like Pol Pot shot people with glasses who can read.
[00:19:51.608 --> 00:19:53.970]  Here, they just take your license and put you in jail.
[00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:59.533]  We'll be back with Dr. Blaylock on the other side to break down the technicals of Obamacare.
[00:19:59.533 --> 00:20:00.714]  Get ready to pay double!
[00:20:02.588 --> 00:20:08.090]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:11.250]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:14.031]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[00:20:14.031 --> 00:20:16.992]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[00:20:16.992 --> 00:20:19.953]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[00:20:20.453 --> 00:20:25.577]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[00:20:25.577 --> 00:20:28.200]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.803]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.

[00:22:00.492 --> 00:22:01.152]  Merry Christmas!

[00:22:21.803 --> 00:22:27.106]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:27.106 --> 00:22:27.966]  Wait a sec.
[00:22:27.966 --> 00:22:32.369]  Gold and silver is going up while Congress is trying to settle on the next debt increase.
[00:22:32.369 --> 00:22:34.090]  And there's no end to this madness.

[00:24:16.047 --> 00:24:18.989]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:18.989 --> 00:24:24.154]  Retired brain surgeon, best-selling author, Dr. Russell Blaylock is our guest for the balance of the hour.
[00:24:24.154 --> 00:24:28.637]  There will be news and calls in the third hour coming up.
[00:24:28.637 --> 00:24:31.600]  Now, again, a lot of doctors say, well, I can't even make money doing this.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:32.501]  It's too dangerous.
[00:24:32.501 --> 00:24:33.521]  I'm out of health care.
[00:24:33.521 --> 00:24:35.023]  Well, you predicted that.
[00:24:35.023 --> 00:24:35.703]  That's the plan.
[00:24:35.703 --> 00:24:36.284]  Bankrupt it.
[00:24:38.135 --> 00:24:44.078]  It takes a huge majority now to overturn Obamacare, really banker care, globalist, eugenics care.
[00:24:44.078 --> 00:24:56.143]  What do you now predict, Dr. Blaylock, is going to happen as people learn, as Bill Gates has laughed, we may play that clip later, that yeah, death panels are good, well now we see the social engineering.
[00:24:56.143 --> 00:24:58.804]  Well, if we're all collectivized, the government's going to say what you eat.
[00:24:59.464 --> 00:25:02.567]  And where you go and what you do and what surgeries you get.
[00:25:02.567 --> 00:25:03.188]  And guess what?
[00:25:03.188 --> 00:25:10.555]  That's what they've already done in England, where you wait, what, 18 months on average for brain surgeries that you need to get it quickly or you're going to die.
[00:25:10.555 --> 00:25:14.759]  I mean, I've watched the House of Commons debates.
[00:25:14.759 --> 00:25:18.443]  How are they going to sell this and keep this in place when it wrecks everything?
[00:25:20.134 --> 00:25:24.255]  Well, the idea is every failure is going to be because of sabotage.
[00:25:24.255 --> 00:25:29.976]  If you look at the Soviet system and all the communist socialist systems, they do the same thing.
[00:25:29.976 --> 00:25:33.017]  When they start to fail, it's not their fault.
[00:25:33.017 --> 00:25:35.618]  It's because people were sabotaging it.
[00:25:35.618 --> 00:25:37.298]  The doctors weren't playing fair.
[00:25:37.298 --> 00:25:38.878]  The doctors were cheating.
[00:25:38.878 --> 00:25:41.439]  The patients weren't doing right.
[00:25:41.439 --> 00:25:43.599]  So they just throw more money at it.
[00:25:43.599 --> 00:25:45.720]  They increase the regulations, the control.
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:54.208]  And so the answer is always the problem is we don't have enough control of all the variables, which means oppression.
[00:25:54.208 --> 00:26:00.535]  We have to oppress the public and the providers and the whole medical care system.
[00:26:00.535 --> 00:26:01.736]  And then it'll work.
[00:26:01.736 --> 00:26:07.863]  And once people take this bitter medicine, they realize, gee, now we've arrived at the utopia.
[00:26:08.283 --> 00:26:14.686]  You know, as I tell people, collectivism and socialism depends on what's called the Big Lie.
[00:26:14.686 --> 00:26:22.509]  You paint this illusion, this utopia that's coming, and you tell people, just keep your eye on the painting, on the mural.
[00:26:22.509 --> 00:26:24.670]  Don't pay attention to reality.
[00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:27.110]  They're never allowed to look at reality.
[00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:30.432]  And every time they do, they say, just look back at the mural.
[00:26:30.432 --> 00:26:33.173]  Look what's coming if you just do what you're told.
[00:26:33.573 --> 00:26:34.833]  So people get on board.
[00:26:34.833 --> 00:26:40.455]  And every communist country, every communist that's escaped, has said the same thing.
[00:26:40.455 --> 00:26:43.235]  They were all true believers in the beginning.
[00:26:43.235 --> 00:26:47.916]  And very, very quickly, they understood that we're being deceived.
[00:26:47.916 --> 00:26:49.257]  We're being lied to.
[00:26:49.257 --> 00:26:52.418]  We're being led and regimented and controlled.
[00:26:52.418 --> 00:26:53.758]  And that's what this is all about.
[00:26:54.278 --> 00:26:57.401]  So, of course, there's going to be devastation.
[00:26:57.401 --> 00:26:58.422]  There's going to be death.
[00:26:58.422 --> 00:26:59.843]  There's going to be people dying.
[00:26:59.843 --> 00:27:01.844]  There's going to be care denied.
[00:27:01.844 --> 00:27:06.548]  But they'll say, oh, this is just the painful growth pains.
[00:27:06.548 --> 00:27:10.552]  This is the birth pains of the coming utopia.
[00:27:10.552 --> 00:27:13.654]  Once we've fared all this out, it's going to be great.
[00:27:13.654 --> 00:27:16.477]  And, of course, all this pain is because of the previous system.
[00:27:16.957 --> 00:27:23.041]  It's just like they always blame Bush or they blame somebody else for every system that happens.
[00:27:23.041 --> 00:27:27.324]  A disaster in this administration is due to the previous administration.
[00:27:27.324 --> 00:27:34.969]  And so the fact that capitalism existed for so long and private property and this excessive freedom
[00:27:35.609 --> 00:27:39.652]  That's why we're having to go through these terrible birth pains.
[00:27:39.652 --> 00:27:44.956]  So they're going to justify every failure just to show how idiotic this thing is.
[00:27:44.956 --> 00:27:53.443]  And so there's a law that says if a physician charges the taxpayer too little money, he is guilty of a crime.
[00:27:54.554 --> 00:27:56.074]  Now this is unbelievable.
[00:27:56.074 --> 00:28:02.436]  The whole idea of these doctors going to prison is that they were defrauding the taxpayer.
[00:28:02.436 --> 00:28:17.960]  Well, here if you actually are saving the taxpayer money by undercoding, that is coding for a less expensive procedure, you're also guilty of a crime just the same as if you overcharge the government.
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:42.801]  And for those that don't know, that's the age-old thing where doctors and the Hippocratic Oath, Ron Paul's talked about it here on the show, Medical Doctor, that you were told going to medical school you should do about a third of your work discounted or for free on a case-by-case example and if it's some equipment or prosthesis or things you should approach a charity to come in and pay for it because this is a sacred honor to be a physician.
[00:28:43.161 --> 00:28:47.824]  Will you explain to them the old system and why Ron Paul pointed out nobody ever went without health care?
[00:28:47.824 --> 00:28:49.306]  Citizens just didn't know about it.
[00:28:49.306 --> 00:28:51.827]  The illegal aliens all know about it.
[00:28:51.827 --> 00:29:01.274]  Well, when I was in Madison, you know, for 40 years, counting my residency, we gave away millions of dollars of free care.
[00:29:01.274 --> 00:29:10.681]  I got up in the middle of the night and operated all night long on people who were indigent or for whatever reason, they didn't have money, and we didn't charge them anything.
[00:29:11.501 --> 00:29:18.083]  Every Christmas, we would go through our bills and we would find elderly people who were trying to pay their bills off a little bit at a time.
[00:29:18.083 --> 00:29:20.483]  We would cancel their bills.
[00:29:20.483 --> 00:29:23.544]  We used to give insurance only.
[00:29:23.544 --> 00:29:31.726]  We would tell patients if they had difficulty paying the charge out of pocket, we would say, well, we'll just accept insurance.
[00:29:31.726 --> 00:29:32.106]  Stay there.
[00:29:32.106 --> 00:29:35.987]  Let's explain what the old good medicine was that's now been taken over the last 30 years.
[00:29:36.647 --> 00:29:41.250]  Now converting to pure eugenics-based death medicine, death panels.
[00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:44.332]  They now brag the government runs your medicine.
[00:29:44.332 --> 00:29:45.192]  Unbelievable.
[00:29:45.192 --> 00:29:50.496]  We'll be right back with Dr. Blaylock.
[00:29:50.496 --> 00:29:51.897]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.897 --> 00:29:54.418]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.418 --> 00:29:57.100]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.175 --> 00:30:05.296]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu, and other illnesses.
[00:30:05.296 --> 00:30:06.517]  Don't be one of them!

[00:33:08.658 --> 00:33:12.300]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest.
[00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:15.282]  A gun on my hip and the right to arrest.
[00:33:15.282 --> 00:33:18.645]  I'm a guy who's a boss on this highway.
[00:33:18.645 --> 00:33:21.687]  So watch out what you're doing when you're driving my way.
[00:33:21.687 --> 00:33:24.028]  If you break the law, you'll hear from me.
[00:33:24.028 --> 00:33:27.651]  I know I'm working for the state on my highway patrol.
[00:33:39.818 --> 00:33:45.280]  And, uh, I didn't have my latest insurance card, even though their computer showed I had insurance.
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.901]  They gave me a ticket for that, too.
[00:33:46.901 --> 00:33:53.443]  And I was just thinking, you know, they make you buy car insurance, but then they let the illegal aliens be exempt.
[00:33:54.224 --> 00:34:00.685]  And it just really hit me that now I've got to go buy health care, even though I already have insurance.
[00:34:00.685 --> 00:34:13.868]  And now, obviously, it's written by the insurance companies, it's going to go up in price, and they get to charge you more for less procedures and also make sure the doctors and the medical facility get less of that money.
[00:34:13.868 --> 00:34:18.149]  So, you know, they might charge you a million bucks pretty soon to put a Band-Aid on you.
[00:34:18.149 --> 00:34:21.530]  And this is what happens in every communist or socialist or collective system.
[00:34:22.541 --> 00:34:25.222]  And why is Bill Gates and Warren Buffett supporting it?
[00:34:25.222 --> 00:34:26.983]  Well, they're taking over health care.
[00:34:26.983 --> 00:34:28.944]  And they admit it's death panels.
[00:34:28.944 --> 00:34:44.131]  I want to finish up with Obamacare with Dr. Russell Blaylock here in a moment in this long segment we have and segue into the cholesterol conspiracy, statin drugs, vaccines this year, the biggest push I've ever seen for them.
[00:34:44.131 --> 00:34:46.393]  His website's BlaylockWellnessCenter.com.
[00:34:46.393 --> 00:34:49.014]  Amazing books and also some pretty amazing
[00:34:49.674 --> 00:34:49.935]  Thank you.
[00:35:03.317 --> 00:35:06.499]  But briefly here, don't forget we are listener supported.
[00:35:06.499 --> 00:35:17.185]  When you click on the web banners and support our sponsors that funds our operations at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and we promote, and you hear me endorse on there, things I use.
[00:35:17.185 --> 00:35:24.649]  Like the high quality products at InfoWarsHealth.com, the essential fatty acids, the Biontang and Tangerine, all of it.
[00:35:27.222 --> 00:35:35.644]  That supports the broadcast, InfoWarsHealth.com, plus great products we've researched and researched with medical doctors and others, finding the best products out there.
[00:35:35.644 --> 00:35:39.565]  But also things like the Pro-Pure Stainless Steel Water Filtration Systems.
[00:35:39.565 --> 00:35:40.826]  Clean water is so important.
[00:35:40.826 --> 00:35:46.347]  There's so many additives, so many toxins, sodium fluoride, you name it, we've got fluoride filters available with it.
[00:35:46.347 --> 00:35:51.628]  InfoWarsStore.com, promo code WATER15, you can get 15% off.
[00:35:51.628 --> 00:35:53.629]  We're gonna end that promotion this Sunday.
[00:35:54.788 --> 00:35:55.208]  I don't know.
[00:36:24.728 --> 00:36:26.529]  Thousands of special productions.
[00:36:26.529 --> 00:36:29.070]  It's really ridiculous how much is there.
[00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:32.451]  PrisonPlanet.tv or InfoWarsNews.com.
[00:36:32.451 --> 00:36:34.832]  One membership, $5.95 a month.
[00:36:34.832 --> 00:36:39.694]  Now can be used by 10 people simultaneously with one username and passcode you create.
[00:36:40.074 --> 00:36:42.875]  Give it as a gift, just an e-card or a physical card.
[00:36:42.875 --> 00:36:47.377]  Hey, here's your documentary news website subscription.
[00:36:47.377 --> 00:36:50.558]  59 cents a month is how much that gift is to give people.
[00:36:50.558 --> 00:36:52.798]  And it supports our transmission, not really at that price.
[00:36:52.798 --> 00:36:56.460]  That just pays for the bandwidth and our growing media platform, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:00.001]  Okay, Dr. Blowlock, this is a long segment.
[00:37:00.001 --> 00:37:11.963]  I want to try to shut up and give you the floor here, you know, for some large spaces to finish up where you see we're going and ways to hopefully reverse Obamacare because they lied and said it will not increase premiums.
[00:37:11.963 --> 00:37:16.744]  Obviously, it would immediately because it was written by the insurance companies.
[00:37:16.744 --> 00:37:19.545]  And where you see all this going, ways to fight it.
[00:37:19.545 --> 00:37:24.566]  And then I want to segue into suddenly ABC News, CBN.
[00:37:26.986 --> 00:37:48.854]  You name it, about coconut oil that you wrote about, I don't know, 20 years ago or whatever, and other types of good fats, and what they're doing for the brains, and the fact that so many of these disorders we see are really just nutrient deficiencies, and some of that information, because it's something that people can really do right now.
[00:37:48.854 --> 00:37:52.636]  Yeah, go back to the Obamacare.
[00:37:53.678 --> 00:37:55.600]  What's coming?
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:05.149]  You know, the interesting thing when I first read through the Obamacare thing that struck me is that it really says specifically very little.
[00:38:05.149 --> 00:38:13.678]  What it does is it refers to literally tens of thousands of other federal documents, rules, and regulations.
[00:38:14.338 --> 00:38:19.022]  And it leads a lot to arbitrary change after the law is enacted.
[00:38:19.022 --> 00:38:33.375]  Now what's coming is, and you've got to remember, when Hillary first tried to create this system, when her husband was the president, she met with all the major pharmaceutical CEOs in secret.
[00:38:33.375 --> 00:38:37.879]  Because they were going to make a killing out of nationalizing healthcare.
[00:38:38.459 --> 00:38:43.725]  Because they would be the sole supplier of all medicines all over the United States.
[00:38:43.725 --> 00:38:47.890]  No one else would be allowed to supply these medications.
[00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:50.212]  That would get rid of their competition.
[00:38:50.212 --> 00:38:52.375]  The same thing holds here.
[00:38:52.375 --> 00:38:58.922]  And what we're going to see is that the manufacturers of vaccines that have been anointed, that were anointed during the H1N1,
[00:39:00.623 --> 00:39:13.995]  By the way, they're already doing that, as you know, with medical workers and hospitals.
[00:39:13.995 --> 00:39:18.058]  But they're already saying if you want your welfare check, you've got to get all the shots.
[00:39:18.058 --> 00:39:21.381]  So this is forced government medicine, medical tyranny.
[00:39:22.509 --> 00:39:26.290]  Exactly, and it's all designed to control people.
[00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:38.515]  So, if you go to your doctor for, say, a carpal tunnel problem, you're going to be told, well, we looked at your record and you haven't had your meningococcal vaccine this year.
[00:39:39.455 --> 00:39:42.356]  Are you going to have to get it or you can't be treated?
[00:39:42.356 --> 00:39:46.458]  So everyone now is going to be forced vaccinated.
[00:39:46.458 --> 00:39:57.103]  The companies like Merck and Novartis are going to make fortunes if you're vaccinating every human being in the United States and eventually they plan for the entire world.
[00:39:57.103 --> 00:39:58.944]  Unbelievable.
[00:39:58.944 --> 00:40:02.265]  You'll be told what you can eat, what you cannot eat.
[00:40:02.265 --> 00:40:05.307]  You'll be told when to exercise, how much exercise to do.
[00:40:06.448 --> 00:40:14.757]  You're going to be told you have to take statins, you have to take antihypertensive medications, the children will be placed on these medications.
[00:40:14.757 --> 00:40:16.559]  This is already being discussed.
[00:40:16.559 --> 00:40:24.348]  They were even talking about putting these medications in the water supply to force everyone to be on these medications whether they wanted to or not.
[00:40:24.969 --> 00:40:27.630]  And by the way, as you're talking, I just can't help but butt in.
[00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:34.214]  Everything you're talking about is already being phased in with the mayor of New York saying what you can drink, what you can eat.
[00:40:34.214 --> 00:40:38.216]  With Michelle Obama, my kids were going to private school part-time.
[00:40:38.216 --> 00:40:43.899]  And even this Christian school, two days a week, as an academy for homeschoolers, it was big.
[00:40:43.899 --> 00:40:46.320]  They were accredited so they had to do work
[00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:46.880]  I don't know.
[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:11.204]  Yeah, well they have a very incremental program to get the public used to it.
[00:41:11.204 --> 00:41:19.390]  And they've done an incredible brainwashing of the public on the necessity of vaccination for herd immunity.
[00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:22.132]  Herd immunity is a complete fraud.
[00:41:22.132 --> 00:41:23.273]  And I've proved it.
[00:41:23.273 --> 00:41:24.374]  No one's challenged it.
[00:41:25.334 --> 00:41:34.381]  Uh, so what they're doing, they're building the case that for the public health, we have to force people to receive all of these vaccines.
[00:41:34.381 --> 00:41:40.006]  Well, it's been shown they have over 125 vaccines that they're planning to make mandatory.
[00:41:40.886 --> 00:41:49.248]  This is huge profits for these companies and it's going to destroy the health of tens of millions of Americans.
[00:41:49.248 --> 00:41:56.469]  And as you get older and you get these vaccines and your health begins to rapidly deteriorate, guess what?
[00:41:56.469 --> 00:42:03.531]  You're not going to be allowed to get health care that you think you're going to get because you're going to be on the list of people that's too old to get these
[00:42:04.571 --> 00:42:06.191]  You're done.
[00:42:06.191 --> 00:42:07.852]  So you're going to be left to die.
[00:42:07.852 --> 00:42:09.392]  There's your death penalty.
[00:42:09.392 --> 00:42:18.633]  Now, all of this has been talked about on the health care sites and these tax-free foundations for almost half a century.
[00:42:18.633 --> 00:42:20.274]  People just have not been reading it.
[00:42:20.274 --> 00:42:22.594]  They're not paying attention.
[00:42:22.594 --> 00:42:26.075]  You've brought up so many of these things to the public.
[00:42:26.075 --> 00:42:27.275]  You read these documents.
[00:42:27.275 --> 00:42:29.375]  You dig these things out.
[00:42:29.375 --> 00:42:31.596]  But unfortunately, it sounds so
[00:42:34.076 --> 00:42:38.077]  Outlandish and crazy and conspiratorial.
[00:42:38.077 --> 00:42:41.098]  People just can't bring themselves to believe it.
[00:42:41.098 --> 00:42:42.299]  And it's like C.S.
[00:42:42.299 --> 00:42:45.620]  Lewis in his book The Screwtape Letters.
[00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:49.901]  He said that the devil's greatest weapon is that people don't believe in him.
[00:42:49.901 --> 00:42:56.684]  Well, the collectivist and the socialist and the communist's greatest weapon is that you don't believe they're going to do these nefarious things.
[00:42:56.684 --> 00:43:02.846]  Well, yeah, they now laugh and say there's no such thing as socialism or communism anymore, even though it's taking over the whole planet.
[00:43:04.022 --> 00:43:07.045]  Well, what they do is they do wordplay.
[00:43:07.045 --> 00:43:09.187]  They say, this is not socialism.
[00:43:09.187 --> 00:43:16.233]  Well, in a technical definition and previous definitions of socialism, it's not.
[00:43:16.233 --> 00:43:20.737]  Because socialism is the nationalization of all businesses and industry.
[00:43:21.377 --> 00:43:35.543]  The new socialism, which was Antonio Gramsci's idea, and later Saul Alensky's popularized it, was that we don't actually take over the company, we just regulate it.
[00:43:35.543 --> 00:43:49.469]  And we regulate how much it produces, how much it pays its employees, what is their work hours, what are the... Exactly, the communists can't ever run anything but a death cam, so they just sit back and you run your operation, and they siphon it off and tell you what to do.
[00:43:50.253 --> 00:43:51.154]  That's exactly right.
[00:43:51.154 --> 00:43:52.797]  That's what National Socialism was.
[00:43:52.797 --> 00:43:54.940]  That's what Fascism in Italy was.
[00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:58.024]  And that's what we have today, what's called Corporatism.
[00:43:58.024 --> 00:44:03.131]  Now, if you look back in the history of Collectivism, it was based on the corporate model.
[00:44:03.131 --> 00:44:06.436]  They loved the corporation because the corporation has an elite board.
[00:44:06.836 --> 00:44:08.056]  No, it's just the opposite.
[00:44:08.056 --> 00:44:10.197]  It's corporations taking over the government.
[00:44:31.181 --> 00:44:33.522]  Because what you have is Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:44:33.522 --> 00:44:36.424]  Look at the list of people in Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:44:36.424 --> 00:44:42.447]  It's the CEOs and Directors of every major corporation in the United States.
[00:44:42.447 --> 00:44:44.388]  Look at the Trilateral Commission.
[00:44:44.388 --> 00:44:45.268]  Same thing.
[00:44:45.268 --> 00:44:49.030]  All the major international corporations and financial houses.
[00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:50.531]  Look at Bilderberg.
[00:44:50.531 --> 00:44:51.271]  Same list.
[00:44:51.271 --> 00:44:53.172]  Same people.
[00:44:53.172 --> 00:44:54.333]  And it's all corporate.
[00:44:54.773 --> 00:45:01.617]  Now, the dream of the Rockefellers was that we would create a corporate control of the United States.
[00:45:01.617 --> 00:45:04.599]  They look at government and they say, government's inefficient.
[00:45:04.599 --> 00:45:08.582]  And this is the whole essence of collectivism is efficiency.
[00:45:08.582 --> 00:45:12.684]  Well, efficiency means making people do what they don't want to do.
[00:45:12.684 --> 00:45:14.165]  Taking their freedom away.
[00:45:14.165 --> 00:45:16.687]  We know best as an elite, they say.
[00:45:17.667 --> 00:45:26.637]  What you need to do, where you need to be, where you need to live, what your occupation should be, what you should eat, when you should die, if you should live.
[00:45:26.637 --> 00:45:29.920]  This is what socialism, collectivism is.
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:34.145]  And if you pay close attention to what they're saying, that's what they're telling you.
[00:45:34.665 --> 00:45:36.127]  We're the smart people.
[00:45:36.127 --> 00:45:38.851]  We know how to engineer society.
[00:45:38.851 --> 00:45:41.915]  Society's chaotic under capitalism and freedom.
[00:45:41.915 --> 00:45:44.479]  We can't stand this chaos anymore.
[00:45:44.479 --> 00:45:48.905]  We need to have social engineering and social control.
[00:45:48.905 --> 00:45:50.307]  And that's what all of this is about.
[00:45:50.968 --> 00:45:52.248]  How do we fight it?
[00:45:52.248 --> 00:45:53.329]  How do we resist them?
[00:45:53.329 --> 00:45:56.349]  I mean, one thing is I'm trying to exercise more.
[00:45:56.349 --> 00:45:59.270]  I've become a workaholic and gained a lot of weight and gotten unhealthy.
[00:45:59.270 --> 00:46:01.090]  I'm reversing that by the grace of God.
[00:46:01.090 --> 00:46:13.573]  I mean, I guess we get healthy and we exercise and we really get the proper nutrition, understanding that there's not going to be a medical system to go to soon.
[00:46:13.573 --> 00:46:14.413]  And this isn't a joke.
[00:46:15.333 --> 00:46:19.977]  Paul Watson's worked for me 10 years.
[00:46:19.977 --> 00:46:28.244]  Great shape, jogs, 3% body fat, lives in England, riding for us.
[00:46:28.244 --> 00:46:31.087]  I told you the story last time you were on, Doc.
[00:46:31.087 --> 00:46:35.070]  For a month, he had some type of strep and cold.
[00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:37.332]  Couldn't get over it.
[00:46:37.332 --> 00:46:39.815]  Had been to the doctor, waited two weeks to get in.
[00:46:39.815 --> 00:46:43.019]  I couldn't imagine having to wait two weeks the few times I've really had to go.
[00:46:43.019 --> 00:46:45.742]  I mean, I'm like, get me in there now when you're coughing up blood.
[00:46:45.742 --> 00:46:48.666]  I mean, it was rough.
[00:46:48.666 --> 00:46:52.191]  And then two weeks into it, he finally got in and they gave him a little pack
[00:46:52.847 --> 00:46:59.932]  With some aspirin and some Advil and some Tylenol and some lozenges and some Kleenex and stuff.
[00:46:59.932 --> 00:47:02.614]  And you said, I guess, in the military, that's what you gave you.
[00:47:02.614 --> 00:47:03.694]  I got a lot of emails about that.
[00:47:03.694 --> 00:47:04.155]  That's what they said.
[00:47:04.155 --> 00:47:05.556]  They gave you the military.
[00:47:05.556 --> 00:47:07.697]  There wasn't like when I go to a private clinic.
[00:47:07.697 --> 00:47:08.978]  Boom, I'm in in 20 minutes.
[00:47:08.978 --> 00:47:10.219]  They swab the throat.
[00:47:10.219 --> 00:47:13.341]  They say, we'll call you in two hours and tell you what the prescription is.
[00:47:13.341 --> 00:47:15.823]  Because if it's bacterial or viral, they've got to find out.
[00:47:16.363 --> 00:47:20.464]  You know, these quack doctors, you go to them, they just give you antibiotics, don't even check.
[00:47:20.464 --> 00:47:22.885]  But, you know, the clinics, places I go, they do.
[00:47:22.885 --> 00:47:23.865]  I couldn't imagine that.
[00:47:23.865 --> 00:47:25.646]  And then I said, why don't you go to private doctors?
[00:47:25.646 --> 00:47:27.146]  I said, I know you have those.
[00:47:27.146 --> 00:47:34.368]  He goes, listen, Alex, you've got to get permission from the government clinic to then go to the private physician.
[00:47:34.368 --> 00:47:36.009]  I mean, this is total control.
[00:47:36.009 --> 00:47:39.630]  I'm sorry to tell that story again, but this is total tyranny.
[00:47:40.712 --> 00:47:43.354]  Well, it's an example of the regimentation.
[00:47:43.354 --> 00:47:44.676]  You're not an individual.
[00:47:44.676 --> 00:47:47.398]  The enemy of collectivism is the individual.
[00:47:47.398 --> 00:47:55.124]  You read all of the literature on the philosophy of this socialism, communism, Marxism, Leninism, fascism, National Socialism.
[00:47:55.124 --> 00:47:56.205]  It's always the same.
[00:47:56.205 --> 00:47:58.107]  The enemy is the individual.
[00:47:58.427 --> 00:48:00.088]  They don't recognize individuals.
[00:48:00.088 --> 00:48:01.409]  They recognize collectives.
[00:48:01.409 --> 00:48:02.290]  You're a number.
[00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:03.951]  You're a social security number.
[00:48:03.951 --> 00:48:05.632]  You're some other kind of number.
[00:48:05.632 --> 00:48:11.076]  And if we have to deny you care or if you die waiting for care, it's no big deal.
[00:48:11.076 --> 00:48:13.258]  You were just a number.
[00:48:13.258 --> 00:48:15.840]  And people are not used to that in the United States.
[00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:19.963]  You know, as a Christian, we recognize individuals.
[00:48:19.963 --> 00:48:22.685]  God recognizes individuals.
[00:48:22.685 --> 00:48:24.726]  And, you know, you say, what can we do?
[00:48:24.726 --> 00:48:27.448]  Well, number one, we've got to re-strengthen our faith.
[00:48:27.448 --> 00:48:41.378]  They have spent enormous efforts to convince people there's no God, that Jesus is not the Son of God, and so they've destroyed the faith base of the foundation of our country.
[00:48:41.578 --> 00:48:45.283]  We need to re-establish that, number one, over everything else.
[00:48:45.283 --> 00:48:55.278]  We can improve our health so that if we are forcibly vaccinated, we're not likely to have the devastating reactions to these vaccines.
[00:48:55.278 --> 00:48:56.439]  We know how to do that now.
[00:48:57.842 --> 00:49:01.987]  We know how to improve health of the elderly so that they don't get sick.
[00:49:01.987 --> 00:49:05.453]  They are seriously ill like they do now.
[00:49:05.453 --> 00:49:12.883]  Many of the neurodegenerative diseases can be prevented by proper exercise and use of nutrients and diet.
[00:49:14.245 --> 00:49:16.806]  The other thing that we could do is nullification.
[00:49:16.806 --> 00:49:19.568]  That is the most important weapon we have left.
[00:49:19.568 --> 00:49:23.270]  The vote has been taken away by voter fraud.
[00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:31.715]  So no matter how you vote, they're going to cheat, change the machines, change the vote, get people in that are illegal to vote, etc.
[00:49:31.715 --> 00:49:37.739]  So what the states have left is the state can nullify laws by passing its own state laws.
[00:49:37.739 --> 00:49:39.100]  And if you're in a court,
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:52.606]  If you're on a jury and it's a federal case, say an IRS case against a citizen or an EPA case or one of these medical cases, and you're on the jury, you can nullify it by voting not guilty, no matter what the evidence shows.
[00:49:52.606 --> 00:49:56.308]  That is the law of the land of the Constitution.
[00:49:56.308 --> 00:50:04.772]  And this was established in the beginning of the United States because the courts had judges that were British and American juries.
[00:50:04.892 --> 00:50:05.753]  You know, God bless you.
[00:50:05.753 --> 00:50:08.354]  I don't know if you heard this a month ago, but it made national news.
[00:50:08.354 --> 00:50:17.300]  I've called for the Second American Revolution to use the Declaration of Independence to not create a new country, but to remove the globalists and reinstate the republic.
[00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:20.282]  It's an instant download, re-upload.
[00:50:20.282 --> 00:50:21.562]  And what you're saying is so true.
[00:50:21.562 --> 00:50:22.703]  There's election fraud.
[00:50:22.703 --> 00:50:24.104]  Obama didn't really win.
[00:50:24.104 --> 00:50:25.525]  I'm not saying Romney was good either.
[00:50:25.525 --> 00:50:27.366]  He wrote Obamacare for the globalists.
[00:50:27.366 --> 00:50:28.587]  The point is, it was all fixed.
[00:50:29.347 --> 00:50:34.895]  Only admitting that we're under real authoritarianism that now plans to mop us up?
[00:50:34.895 --> 00:50:37.679]  Only admitting how much trouble we're in will beat them!
[00:50:37.679 --> 00:50:44.488]  The minute we understand they're lying criminal authoritarians, hell-bent on enslaving us, we turn the tide.
[00:50:44.488 --> 00:50:45.950]  Do you agree with that statement, Dr. Blaylock?
[00:50:46.491 --> 00:50:47.052]  Exactly.
[00:50:47.052 --> 00:50:48.593]  You can't compromise with evil.
[00:50:48.593 --> 00:50:49.794]  These are evil people.
[00:50:49.794 --> 00:50:51.595]  They have evil intentions.
[00:50:51.595 --> 00:50:57.160]  So this nonsense of the Republican Party saying, oh, well, our problem is we have too many conservatives.
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:58.842]  Oh, we're defending... God bless you.
[00:50:58.842 --> 00:50:59.442]  I want to hear that.
[00:50:59.442 --> 00:51:00.043]  Exactly.
[00:51:00.043 --> 00:51:01.084]  We're going to talk about that when...
[00:51:01.964 --> 00:51:08.588]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[00:51:08.588 --> 00:51:10.969]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[00:51:10.969 --> 00:51:11.429]  The U.S.
[00:51:11.429 --> 00:51:15.672]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[00:51:15.672 --> 00:51:18.634]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[00:51:18.634 --> 00:51:20.114]  They want that attack to come.
[00:51:20.114 --> 00:51:26.298]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[00:51:26.687 --> 00:51:29.369]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[00:51:29.369 --> 00:51:34.332]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[00:51:34.332 --> 00:51:41.757]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town, because there'll be absolute panic.
[00:51:42.077 --> 00:51:44.840]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:47.922]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.
[00:51:47.922 --> 00:51:52.506]  Strategic Relocation Film with Joel Skousen and Alex Jones.

[00:52:02.844 --> 00:52:14.369]  You land in Buenos Aires, then a shuttle to Santa Rosa, where a nicely furnished cabin with all amenities, Wi-Fi, executive food and wine, and laundry service awaits.
[00:52:14.369 --> 00:52:17.790]  After a good night's sleep, your adventure begins.
[00:52:17.790 --> 00:52:21.252]  You're on a golden stag safari for big game.
[00:52:22.212 --> 00:52:23.534]  But it's not Africa.
[00:52:23.534 --> 00:52:25.096]  It's Argentina.
[00:52:25.096 --> 00:52:33.887]  One-on-one guided hunts for water buffalo, cougar, bighorn rams, wild boar, and the biggest stag deer in South America.
[00:52:33.887 --> 00:52:35.769]  All gold medal quality.
[00:52:35.769 --> 00:52:37.351]  All the action you can handle.
[00:52:38.843 --> 00:52:46.970]  Land Rovers, top rental guns with scopes, all food, beverages, hunting guides, ground transportation included, and more.
[00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:49.913]  All more affordable than you can imagine.
[00:52:49.913 --> 00:52:55.058]  The adventure of a lifetime starts at GoldenStagSafaris.com.
[00:52:55.058 --> 00:52:57.160]  The big game hunting ranch.
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:58.941]  GoldenStagSafaris.com.
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:05.803]  We travel so much, and having a fake TV, well, it gives added peace of mind.
[00:53:05.803 --> 00:53:15.548]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets, but fake TV can fool even professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[00:53:15.548 --> 00:53:27.514]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home.
[00:53:27.694 --> 00:53:32.299]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer.
[00:53:32.299 --> 00:53:34.081]  And they're so easy to use.
[00:53:34.081 --> 00:53:36.004]  You just plug them in and they're ready to go.
[00:53:36.004 --> 00:53:40.048]  Plus, they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.
[00:53:40.048 --> 00:53:43.933]  Fake TV is only $34.95 and makes a great Christmas gift.
[00:53:44.193 --> 00:53:47.817]  Order your FAKE TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to FAKETV.com.
[00:53:47.817 --> 00:53:49.079]  That's 877-532-5388 or FAKETV.com.
[00:53:49.079 --> 00:53:51.241]  FAKE TV, the burglar deterrent.
[00:54:09.056 --> 00:54:19.340]  We've got two short segments left with Dr. Blaylock, and then we're going to go to your phone calls, those of you patiently holding, and then into all the other news I haven't gotten to yet.
[00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:26.563]  But Harry Belafonte went on Al Sharpton's show and said we should, quote, just lock people up.
[00:54:26.563 --> 00:54:32.685]  We should just round up the Republicans, like third world dictators do, and, quote, throw them in jail.
[00:54:33.646 --> 00:54:39.128]  And that's exactly what the weathermen came out in federal court were planning to do, the people that advise Obama.
[00:54:39.128 --> 00:54:41.209]  You see, I've studied these people.
[00:54:41.209 --> 00:54:45.431]  And just like Dr. Blaylock was just saying, this stuff all sounds crazy.
[00:54:45.431 --> 00:54:47.312]  It's because truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:54:47.312 --> 00:54:54.835]  And the very same crews and the sciences that the Nazis and the Soviets and the Maoists used are now being used here.
[00:54:54.835 --> 00:55:00.578]  I've talked to so many former Eastern Europeans who were successful businessmen and women who fled here in the 70s and 80s.
[00:55:02.296 --> 00:55:04.077]  And they are so freaked out.
[00:55:04.077 --> 00:55:05.498]  They're scared for America.
[00:55:05.498 --> 00:55:07.620]  Because they say, I have seen this.
[00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:08.500]  I have heard this.
[00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:10.962]  This is a blueprint.
[00:55:10.962 --> 00:55:16.065]  And exactly what Dr. Blaylock said, folks, we've got to really understand this is war.
[00:55:16.065 --> 00:55:18.747]  This isn't just some boss hog corruption taking over.
[00:55:18.747 --> 00:55:20.488]  These are vicious control freaks.
[00:55:20.488 --> 00:55:22.289]  Anything else on that subject, Dr. Blaylock?
[00:55:22.289 --> 00:55:31.716]  And then some basic facts on why do you think it's starting to come out that so many of the Alzheimer problems are the statin drugs and the lack of good oils?
[00:55:33.737 --> 00:55:43.901]  Well, yeah, you know, the Harry Belafonis and these people making these statements, they've been empowered by the rise of the left.
[00:55:43.901 --> 00:55:50.424]  The left is seeing and flexing its muscles because they're seeing that they're winning, essentially.
[00:55:50.424 --> 00:55:53.305]  And they're winning by stealing elections.
[00:55:54.185 --> 00:56:00.995]  Now, what we need to do is, as I say, use the power of nullification on juries.
[00:56:00.995 --> 00:56:06.162]  You can protect your fellow citizen against these abuses by the federal government.
[00:56:06.162 --> 00:56:07.504]  Just serve on a jury.
[00:56:08.804 --> 00:56:13.090]  Uh, now, uh, the judge cannot direct you how to vote.
[00:56:13.090 --> 00:56:16.914]  People should get intimidated because they said, well, the judge gave us instructions.
[00:56:16.914 --> 00:56:18.657]  Well, he can instruct all day long.
[00:56:18.657 --> 00:56:24.163]  So jury nullification, elaborating on that point you made before the break though, and then we'll get into the other issue briefly here.
[00:56:24.904 --> 00:56:30.786]  When you, you know, talk about Republicans, that is waving the white flag when they were always part of the establishment.
[00:56:30.786 --> 00:56:41.648]  To say, we need to accept socialism, and you know, Glenn Beck comes out and says we need to push, you know, basically gay marriage or whatever, because, you know, we need to be like the Democrats, that's how we'll win.
[00:56:41.648 --> 00:56:43.369]  That's all football issues anyways.
[00:56:43.369 --> 00:56:46.690]  My point is, that's a total capitulation.
[00:56:46.690 --> 00:56:50.851]  And the left says, oh great, look, we're totally taking over, they're gonna give in to us.
[00:56:52.318 --> 00:56:56.500]  Well, yes, and then once you yield in one area, they'll just force you to yield in another.
[00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:59.202]  I mean, all they have to do is make something else unpopular.
[00:56:59.202 --> 00:57:03.024]  They have to make the fact that you want to own property unpopular.
[00:57:03.024 --> 00:57:06.966]  Make the fact that you want to own a gun and protect your family unpopular.
[00:57:06.966 --> 00:57:11.869]  Make the fact that you want to choose your own food and grow a garden in your yard unpopular.
[00:57:11.869 --> 00:57:14.351]  And then with each case, we're going to compromise.
[00:57:14.351 --> 00:57:19.694]  What we've seen over the last 75 years is we're always compromising towards the left.
[00:57:20.174 --> 00:57:21.996]  There's never a compromise toward the right.
[00:57:21.996 --> 00:57:23.717]  We always stick to the left.
[00:57:23.717 --> 00:57:37.470]  Now, those of us that are a lot older, what we know is that if you look back in 1950s, when I was growing up, if any of these things were even discussed back then, people would laugh at you and say, there's no way the American people would allow that.
[00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:38.852]  You've got to be crazy.
[00:57:38.852 --> 00:57:41.074]  So if you go back in time, in a time capsule,
[00:57:41.454 --> 00:57:42.956]  They would laugh you out of the room.
[00:57:42.956 --> 00:57:50.665]  And now the official army manuals, as we pull those up, I want to give the number, say they're now preparing, quote, re-education centers.
[00:57:50.665 --> 00:57:53.648]  Doctor, they even use the Soviet term.
[00:57:53.648 --> 00:57:54.329]  Oh, exactly.
[00:57:54.329 --> 00:57:59.314]  This is what's so shocking, is they even use the terminology that's used by KGB.
[00:58:00.175 --> 00:58:00.616]  I think?
[00:58:19.671 --> 00:58:23.714]  More than any president has ever dreamed of, even FDR.
[00:58:23.714 --> 00:58:30.078]  So, uh... The president won't even let Congress see his secret executive order on cyber security.
[00:58:30.078 --> 00:58:31.559]  Why even have a Congress?
[00:58:31.559 --> 00:58:43.886]  Stay there five more minutes with Dr. Blaylock, and he's gonna get into some of the oils and the fact that what he's been talking about forever is now becoming mainstream, which is some good news.
[00:58:43.886 --> 00:58:47.849]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:59:01.427]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.
[00:59:01.427 --> 00:59:05.510]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.

[00:59:54.206 --> 00:59:56.589]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.589 --> 00:59:59.452]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.697 --> 01:00:10.521]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.521 --> 01:00:12.102]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.102 --> 01:00:13.664]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.664 --> 01:00:17.847]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.847 --> 01:00:22.171]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.171 --> 01:00:23.112]  Man, this is killing me.
[01:00:23.112 --> 01:00:28.416]  We're almost out of time with Lindsey Williams, but he'll be on with us tomorrow on the Nightly News, and I'll have excerpts for him on the radio the next day.
[01:00:29.718 --> 01:00:30.519]  Running through it.
[01:00:30.519 --> 01:00:31.601]  Lindsey, gold.
[01:00:31.601 --> 01:00:32.282]  What did they tell you?
[01:00:32.282 --> 01:00:33.704]  Where's gold going?
[01:00:33.704 --> 01:00:37.811]  800 bucks five years ago, four years ago, 1750 now.
[01:00:37.811 --> 01:00:38.673]  Where's gold going?
[01:00:39.434 --> 01:00:41.095]  They have an agenda for gold.
[01:00:41.095 --> 01:00:45.697]  In 2008, at the beginning of the previous administration, gold was $800 an ounce.
[01:00:45.697 --> 01:00:46.997]  Today, gold is approximately $1,700, $1,750.
[01:00:46.997 --> 01:00:48.278]  By 2016, gold is going to $3,000 an ounce.
[01:00:48.278 --> 01:00:49.999]  People, I begged you years ago to buy it.
[01:01:01.784 --> 01:01:04.486]  The currency of the elite is gold and silver.
[01:01:04.486 --> 01:01:07.269]  I am pleading with you now, and I don't sell it.
[01:01:07.269 --> 01:01:09.811]  You'll have to get it from Alex's sponsor.
[01:01:09.811 --> 01:01:23.882]  Again, 38% of the people in the United States of America are on some sort of a check from the government every month, whether it be Medicare, Medicaid, welfare, food stamps, Social Security.
[01:01:23.882 --> 01:01:25.523]  It's a time bomb.
[01:01:25.523 --> 01:01:27.045]  We gotta go to calls.
[01:01:27.865 --> 01:01:38.988]  At the end of four years, 70% of the people in the United States of America, they already have an agenda planned that 70% will be on some sort of a check every month.
[01:01:38.988 --> 01:01:43.649]  There will never be another honest election in the United States of America.
[01:01:43.649 --> 01:01:44.289]  Incredible.
[01:01:44.289 --> 01:01:44.929]  Real fast.
[01:01:44.929 --> 01:01:48.710]  Let's go to Mark in Colorado, a 1360 listener there in Denver.
[01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:49.991]  Mark, thanks for holding.
[01:01:49.991 --> 01:01:50.491]  Quick question.
[01:01:51.479 --> 01:01:52.420]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:54.401]  And real quick for you, Alex.
[01:01:54.401 --> 01:01:56.182]  Double bubble chewing gum.
[01:01:56.182 --> 01:02:00.645]  Not all of their varieties have sugar-free, are sugar.
[01:02:00.645 --> 01:02:01.425]  Thanks a million, bro.
[01:02:01.425 --> 01:02:02.806]  We're almost out of time.
[01:02:02.806 --> 01:02:03.787]  You got a question for Lindsey?
[01:02:03.787 --> 01:02:08.510]  What can the average Joe like me, Mr. Williams, do to fight these evil New World Order?
[01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:12.252]  Is there anything at all I can do, sir, to help fight against these evil people?
[01:02:13.098 --> 01:02:13.678]  Yes.
[01:02:13.678 --> 01:02:17.140]  There is a multitude of things you can do, and I can't give them in two minutes.
[01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:24.444]  Get prepared, get right with God, learn how to be self-sufficient, and get some good friends.
[01:02:24.444 --> 01:02:25.105]  Done all that.
[01:02:25.105 --> 01:02:26.205]  How about you, Mr. Williams?
[01:02:26.205 --> 01:02:28.426]  What do you say, sir?
[01:02:28.426 --> 01:02:32.909]  You definitely have got to know how to be prepared, yeah.
[01:02:32.909 --> 01:02:35.930]  And it includes a whole lot more than just food and water.
[01:02:35.930 --> 01:02:42.254]  You're going to have to make preparations as far as your personal... You know, I just don't know how to give this in a moment's time.
[01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:44.940]  Yeah, that's why I answered the question for him, sir.
[01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:46.161]  I appreciate the call.
[01:02:46.161 --> 01:02:47.721]  Daniel in Wisconsin, you're on the air.
[01:02:47.721 --> 01:02:48.701]  Quick question.
[01:02:48.701 --> 01:02:49.921]  Thank you.
[01:02:49.921 --> 01:02:53.562]  Gentlemen are really bringing up a lot of questions with our financial solvency right now.
[01:02:53.562 --> 01:02:55.203]  You're starting to answer the question that I have.
[01:02:55.203 --> 01:02:56.143]  Can you hear me?
[01:02:56.143 --> 01:02:56.703]  Yes, sir.
[01:02:56.703 --> 01:02:57.443]  Yes.
[01:02:57.443 --> 01:03:00.284]  I'm carrying this on the newsunit.com, also your transmissions.
[01:03:00.284 --> 01:03:06.285]  And what my question is, is regarding the big topic of gold and silver, which you're just sort of getting into here.
[01:03:06.285 --> 01:03:10.766]  And we're watching it kind of go off the fiscal cliff right now on the charts as it's diving down today.
[01:03:11.446 --> 01:03:19.451]  Does Lindsey think that they're going to try to manipulate that price lower so that the elite can get in and buy these sort of protecting type assets?
[01:03:19.451 --> 01:03:22.693]  You know, the same thing that we should be doing here as the middle class?
[01:03:22.693 --> 01:03:31.919]  Does he think that they're going to be manipulating these prices so that they can in fact take advantage of this fiscal cliff and in turn also get profits from this financial crisis?
[01:03:31.919 --> 01:03:33.761]  Do bears live in the woods?
[01:03:33.761 --> 01:03:35.342]  Thank you for the great question, Lindsey.
[01:03:36.263 --> 01:03:37.304]  Yes.
[01:03:37.304 --> 01:03:40.585]  Don't pay any attention to the fact that it goes up and down from time to time.
[01:03:40.585 --> 01:03:43.167]  They want to scare the average person out of it.
[01:03:43.167 --> 01:03:45.208]  But, I've been given the figure.
[01:03:45.208 --> 01:03:49.150]  In 2016, you will have it up to $3,000.
[01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:51.691]  So don't pay any attention to some drops.
[01:03:51.691 --> 01:03:54.653]  Take advantage of them and get in when you can.
[01:03:54.653 --> 01:03:56.074]  Alright, one more call here.
[01:03:56.074 --> 01:03:57.234]  Moving quickly, or maybe two.
[01:03:57.234 --> 01:03:58.375]  Matt in Kansas, quick question.
[01:03:59.850 --> 01:04:06.605]  Yeah, Lindsey, I was wanting to know if your lead contact is giving you any indications on what they fear as far as the people's movement.
[01:04:07.845 --> 01:04:08.285]  Uh, yes.
[01:04:08.285 --> 01:04:11.488]  They're very concerned about an out-of-control president.
[01:04:11.488 --> 01:04:12.469]  Now, please, bear with me.
[01:04:12.469 --> 01:04:14.110]  I'm just giving you what they're telling me.
[01:04:14.110 --> 01:04:31.304]  You can't imagine the emails I've received from my elite friend talking about how the elite themselves, especially the old-time elite, are concerned about a president that is haughty, arrogant, thinks he has the tiger by the tail right now, and is like a bull in a china shop, completely out of control, and even they don't know what to do with him in some instances.
[01:04:33.786 --> 01:04:35.347]  But what do they fear from the people?
[01:04:35.347 --> 01:04:39.709]  I mean, you said it last time, us getting organized and angry, right?
[01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:44.291]  The last thing in the world that they want is civil war.
[01:04:44.291 --> 01:04:46.511]  The last thing they want is civil uprisings.
[01:04:46.511 --> 01:04:48.953]  They want to bring in the new world order according to their plan.
[01:04:48.953 --> 01:04:52.094]  They may not be able to do it, but yet on the other hand, that's what they want.
[01:04:52.094 --> 01:04:55.996]  Yeah, that's why they don't like Obama because he's so communist and hates guns so much.
[01:04:55.996 --> 01:04:57.636]  He may start a civil war trying to get the guns.
[01:04:57.636 --> 01:04:59.057]  Lindsey, we're going to talk to you tomorrow.
[01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:04.342]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:05:04.342 --> 01:05:09.345]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:05:09.345 --> 01:05:16.530]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.

[01:08:13.401 --> 01:08:14.922]  Thomas Jefferson.
[01:08:14.922 --> 01:08:18.583]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:21.972 --> 01:08:37.573]  Well, Fox Sports columnist that we've covered in the first hour has come out and said you are a member of the KKK if you're in the NRA or a gun owner and has called for the ban of firearms for the American people.
[01:08:38.274 --> 01:08:50.123]  Bob Costas, as you know, then went and quoted him and said he, quote, agreed with everything that he had said and then read it word for word off of a teleprompter.
[01:08:50.123 --> 01:08:59.911]  All of that news is up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com with the video and the audio of all of it.
[01:08:59.911 --> 01:09:06.676]  And the establishment thinks you're so dumb that the Republicans have come out with
[01:09:09.434 --> 01:09:27.602]  960 billion in tax increases on the middle class, 600 billion in deduction of the deductions, and the Obamacare 3.8% tax on investments.
[01:09:27.602 --> 01:09:32.424]  Investments, and that means your 401K.
[01:09:32.424 --> 01:09:32.984]  Unbelievable.
[01:09:33.817 --> 01:09:35.577]  And that's being called conservative.
[01:09:35.577 --> 01:09:36.818]  That's the compromise.
[01:09:36.818 --> 01:09:43.559]  Obama wants dictatorial power to have Congress just sign away the power of the purse to him, when he's already operating like that on so many fronts.
[01:09:43.559 --> 01:09:45.560]  They're all just complete fronts.
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:51.501]  And here is Max Keiser with his big front page and the mighty London Independent.
[01:09:51.501 --> 01:09:53.801]  Max Keiser, Barack Obama is clueless.
[01:09:53.801 --> 01:09:56.742]  Mitt Romney will bankrupt the country.
[01:09:57.731 --> 01:10:08.143]  And that's exactly what he actually said back in November, and he wants to talk some about this article, but he obviously predicted that Obama would be the winner.
[01:10:08.143 --> 01:10:11.907]  But I mean, to say that Obama is clueless, I mean, we know Max.
[01:10:11.907 --> 01:10:15.871]  Max doesn't really believe that, and that's Robert Chambers.
[01:10:18.024 --> 01:10:18.765]  Are you sure?
[01:10:38.610 --> 01:10:44.134]  Link groups, Syrian rebels, once denied, now key to anti-Assad victories.
[01:10:44.134 --> 01:10:51.820]  And they admit, our government's giving service-to-air missiles to al-Qaeda, that they're the groups making people suicide bomb, or they kill their families.
[01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:54.302]  And this is the height of morality now.
[01:10:54.302 --> 01:10:56.904]  But I've got to get my rights up or al-Qaeda will kill me.
[01:10:56.904 --> 01:10:57.825]  And here's some of the other news.
[01:10:57.825 --> 01:11:01.548]  TSA seeks permission to conduct safety assessments on highways.
[01:11:01.548 --> 01:11:06.812]  TSA is creating and maintaining a watch list of Americans who violate its policies, breaking
[01:11:08.133 --> 01:11:11.815]  The whole Trayvon Martin situation now with the bloody photos.
[01:11:11.815 --> 01:11:13.497]  Why did the media cover that up in the government?
[01:11:13.497 --> 01:11:16.539]  Because they want to get racial division in this country.
[01:11:16.539 --> 01:11:18.080]  That is just some of what we've got.
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:25.566]  And then dealing with the financial fiscal cliff that Max Keiser has been talking about.
[01:11:25.566 --> 01:11:32.472]  Earlier I read the headlines out of England, I'm looking for that article right now, where the Bank of England had said this is like
[01:11:33.194 --> 01:11:34.815]  A world war.
[01:11:34.815 --> 01:11:39.276]  It is so bad and basically said there's no way to pay things off.
[01:11:39.276 --> 01:11:39.696]  Here it is.
[01:11:39.696 --> 01:11:40.277]  I actually found it.
[01:11:40.277 --> 01:11:44.118]  We can document cam shot this for TV viewers.
[01:11:44.118 --> 01:11:46.439]  This is as bad as a world war.
[01:11:46.439 --> 01:11:54.842]  Bank of England bosses grim view of financial crisis, which has left a debt that will be paid by our grandchildren.
[01:11:54.842 --> 01:11:56.042]  It's not meant to be paid.
[01:11:56.042 --> 01:11:56.783]  It's mega banks.
[01:11:57.603 --> 01:12:09.736]  Putting out derivatives that we then back up with a fellow reserve, Europe's doing the same thing, $40 billion a month paid directly to the private shareholders of the fellow reserve, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and others.
[01:12:09.736 --> 01:12:16.163]  And now we're hearing the head of JPMorgan Chase, who ran disgusting ads during football,
[01:12:17.835 --> 01:12:23.880]  On Thanksgiving, literally saying, JPMorgan Chase brought you Thanksgiving.
[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:26.902]  And free markets when they're one of the biggest recipients of corporate welfare.
[01:12:26.902 --> 01:12:32.386]  You can see their plan, global banker occupation, you can see it all now, totally.
[01:12:34.821 --> 01:12:38.802]  And we have now entered the La La Land.
[01:12:38.802 --> 01:12:41.964]  Max Keiser, where on earth are we going?
[01:12:41.964 --> 01:12:52.708]  Break down the points I've made because you've said that you believe by April, that's now only three or four months away, that it's going to be clear that we're in a full bore collapse.
[01:12:52.708 --> 01:12:55.209]  What is your overall take since you were on a month ago?
[01:12:56.221 --> 01:13:00.346]  Oh yeah, five months away to April.
[01:13:00.346 --> 01:13:08.616]  Holding to my prediction, Alex Jones, that you will have a catastrophic event.
[01:13:08.616 --> 01:13:11.159]  And the question was, what would be the trigger?
[01:13:11.159 --> 01:13:14.903]  You know, on this show, your show, we talk about the potential trigger points.
[01:13:15.744 --> 01:13:44.549]  And one that I mentioned a couple of months ago, which is now on the radar of a lot of people, is in Japan, because Japan has the worst debt situation in the world, and they're bringing in a new government in a couple of weeks who has publicly stated that he wants to bring in a quadrillion in yen printing, and he wants to kill the Japanese yen, which would possibly be the first of the G7 nations to enter into a hyperinflationary currency collapse.
[01:13:45.369 --> 01:13:49.053]  So, that's kind of where I'm putting my chips right now.
[01:13:49.053 --> 01:13:57.522]  I think the global currency collapse could start in Japan, and I'm sticking to my timeline of the next five months.
[01:13:57.522 --> 01:14:02.988]  I want to point your attention, direct your attention to something that just came out a couple of days ago.
[01:14:02.988 --> 01:14:03.808]  In Switzerland now,
[01:14:04.733 --> 01:14:06.656]  They've introduced negative interest rates.
[01:14:06.656 --> 01:14:12.744]  This is something I predicted on your show and a couple of others I predicted a year ago or so.
[01:14:12.744 --> 01:14:18.913]  And so if you keep your money in a Swiss bank, they charge you to keep your money in a Swiss bank.
[01:14:18.913 --> 01:14:20.616]  It's a negative interest rate.
[01:14:21.216 --> 01:14:23.738]  This is a form of a capital control.
[01:14:23.738 --> 01:14:26.339]  They don't want people putting their money into Switzerland.
[01:14:26.339 --> 01:14:41.208]  So if you're trying to escape, let's say you're a Japanese yen investor and you're trying to escape the yen and you want to put your money in Switzerland, the Swiss government will charge you to keep your money in a Swiss money market or cash account.
[01:14:41.208 --> 01:14:46.852]  And right now there are six countries in Europe that charge negative interest rates, with Switzerland charging a negative
[01:14:47.612 --> 01:14:53.518]  Up to a half a percentage point to a point on two-year paper, and there's five other countries that offer negative interest rates.
[01:14:53.518 --> 01:15:02.807]  So this idea of putting your money someplace where it's going to be safe, well, these countries have figured this out and they're charging you to keep your money in the bank.
[01:15:02.807 --> 01:15:09.874]  So not only do you have inflation to deal with, but you have the fact that the banks are now openly confiscating your money
[01:15:10.294 --> 01:15:12.618]  Using negative interest rates.
[01:15:12.618 --> 01:15:19.107]  This, of course, will come to the United States soon enough, and so it'll come to the UK as well.
[01:15:19.107 --> 01:15:24.976]  So here's another big story from Just Breaking, which is part of what we talked about on your show before.
[01:15:25.416 --> 01:15:42.185]  You know, Corrections Corps of America, the company that is the biggest private prison operator in America, the company that just did a deal with 48 states in America saying that we'll take your prison business from you and we'll run your prisons if you guarantee 98% occupancy.
[01:15:42.185 --> 01:15:44.346]  That is to say, you put people in prison.
[01:15:44.346 --> 01:15:49.609]  Well, it just came out that Corrections Corps of America is using gangs to run their prisons.
[01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:57.645]  So this is like a gang Ponzi scheme, where the gangs run the prisons to go out to go and put more gangs in prison to run the prison.
[01:15:57.645 --> 01:16:10.473]  And then they rotate them out back on the street to be protected by the police, the certain groups to run the drugs, to launder it back through the megabanks publicly who've been caught and don't get in trouble, who then own the subsidiary private prisons.
[01:16:10.473 --> 01:16:13.315]  So it's an absolute full-spectrum dominance program.
[01:16:13.945 --> 01:16:29.409]  And you can buy stock in Corrections Corps of America and, you know, the elites that Lindsey Williams talks about, I mean, they buy stock in Corrections Corps of America, so they, it's like buying stock on a plantation from Antebellum South, if you wanted to buy, or buying stock in Auschwitz.
[01:16:29.409 --> 01:16:30.550]  Hey, wouldn't that be a great idea?
[01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:31.850]  You could buy stock in Auschwitz.
[01:16:31.850 --> 01:16:35.591]  Of course, I'm sure if Goldman Sachs had an opportunity, they would take Auschwitz publicly.
[01:16:35.731 --> 01:16:47.748]  Well, actually, a lot of the megabanks did fund Hitler, as you know, and then people like my grandfather, they weren't allowed to bomb whole sectors that had Ford and GM factories and slave camps.
[01:16:47.748 --> 01:16:49.811]  So, because the war was a huge profit on both sides.
[01:16:50.521 --> 01:16:53.004]  And let's take a look at the global debt situation.
[01:16:53.004 --> 01:17:00.493]  Since we were on last, the G7 countries, they've moved from being having a debt to GDP of 375% a debt to GDP ratio.
[01:17:00.493 --> 01:17:02.895]  It's now at 415% debt to GDP ratio.
[01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:13.746]  And here's really the story and the methodology and the psychosis.
[01:17:13.746 --> 01:17:20.852]  Ben Bernanke talks about deflation and therefore Jack's interest rates aren't near 0%.
[01:17:22.233 --> 01:17:27.321]  In fact, by putting interest rates near 0%, he causes deflation.
[01:17:27.321 --> 01:17:34.511]  He causes now the insurance industry has stated that because interest rates are so low, they can no longer operate as insurance companies.
[01:17:34.511 --> 01:17:36.534]  So if you don't have insurance, you don't have private property.
[01:17:36.534 --> 01:17:38.537]  If you don't have private property, you don't have capitalism.
[01:17:38.897 --> 01:17:42.879]  So the insurance industry is now saying we can't operate with this low interest rate environment.
[01:17:42.879 --> 01:17:44.359]  So that's a form of deflation.
[01:17:44.359 --> 01:17:47.020]  The wages are getting completely scrubbed.
[01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:48.341]  There hasn't been any wage growth in years.
[01:17:48.341 --> 01:17:49.641]  That's a form of deflation.
[01:17:49.641 --> 01:17:52.882]  And so Bernanke says we're going to lower interest rates to fight deflation.
[01:17:52.882 --> 01:17:56.764]  But in fact, by lowering interest rates, he's guaranteeing deflation.
[01:17:56.764 --> 01:18:04.027]  At the same time, he is creating, and this is a remarkable statistic, the bond market in America.
[01:18:04.807 --> 01:18:07.889]  Is that a 240-year high?
[01:18:07.889 --> 01:18:13.293]  The bond market in the United Kingdom is at a 300-year high.
[01:18:13.293 --> 01:18:21.378]  Never have bonds in 300 years in this country, United Kingdom, have been higher than they are now, or in 240 years in America than they are right now.
[01:18:21.378 --> 01:18:22.959]  That is a classic bubble.
[01:18:22.959 --> 01:18:26.421]  When people say, well, what about this idea that interest rates are going to go higher?
[01:18:26.641 --> 01:18:48.141]  Interest rates will go higher when this bond bubble collapses, and this is part of what I'm saying in the next five months, the trigger that will create the cascade, the domino effect, probably starting in Japan, toward a global sovereign bond collapse, which means interest rates, which are the inverse of a bond price, go up dramatically, and that's your... Why is the Bank of England saying this is Armageddon?
[01:18:49.718 --> 01:18:52.681]  Well, he's now leaving.
[01:18:52.681 --> 01:18:53.962]  Mervyn King is on the way out.
[01:18:53.962 --> 01:18:55.824]  They're bringing this Canadian in.
[01:18:55.824 --> 01:18:58.326]  Here's a perfect example of what you talk about, the New World Order.
[01:18:58.326 --> 01:19:09.437]  The fact that you can just plug and play and take a Canadian central banker and stick it into a British institution, the Bank of England, without anyone questioning, well, who are they answering to?
[01:19:09.437 --> 01:19:11.419]  They're not answering to the sovereign in which they work.
[01:19:11.419 --> 01:19:14.182]  They're answering to a global banking establishment.
[01:19:14.682 --> 01:19:22.205]  If you could just take a Canadian central banker and put him into London, then who's going to fill the Canadian central bank?
[01:19:22.205 --> 01:19:25.786]  That'll probably be somebody from the global banking establishment.
[01:19:25.786 --> 01:19:28.667]  That's like Ireland, it's like Greece, it's like Italy.
[01:19:28.667 --> 01:19:39.311]  They just appoint not just the bankers, but the presidents and prime ministers now, and then brag we're in a world government in hundreds of newspapers, but then have the Southern Broadway Law Center say you're a terrorist if you talk about it.
[01:19:40.509 --> 01:19:47.053]  And they tell the police and training manuals none of it exists, and the cops are like the general public, don't even know how to tie their shoelaces, they believe it.
[01:19:47.053 --> 01:19:52.955]  I mean, it is, and the government runs Al-Qaeda publicly, and I've got to give my rights up.
[01:19:52.955 --> 01:19:56.937]  If I'm downtown shooting video, cops come over and say you can't videotape, you might be Al-Qaeda.
[01:19:56.937 --> 01:20:00.759]  Well, the government runs Al-Qaeda, and the cop doesn't even know what continent he's on.
[01:20:00.759 --> 01:20:02.920]  We'll be back.
[01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:07.663]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the east, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[01:20:08.419 --> 01:20:11.600]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:14.380]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:17.321]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[01:20:17.321 --> 01:20:20.782]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[01:20:20.782 --> 01:20:25.903]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[01:20:25.903 --> 01:20:28.524]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.
[01:20:28.524 --> 01:20:32.125]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[01:20:32.125 --> 01:20:33.705]  I'm taking control of my future.
[01:20:34.205 --> 01:20:35.826]  And you're nuts if you don't do the same.
[01:20:35.826 --> 01:20:39.687]  Go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials.

[01:20:51.851 --> 01:20:54.932]  Would you rather prepare six months too early or one day too late?
[01:20:54.932 --> 01:20:57.472]  409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.

[01:22:02.244 --> 01:22:02.624]  That's right.
[01:22:30.629 --> 01:22:31.870]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:31.870 --> 01:22:36.433]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:36.433 --> 01:22:42.237]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:42.237 --> 01:22:45.879]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:45.879 --> 01:22:48.601]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:48.601 --> 01:22:53.664]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:22:53.664 --> 01:22:53.905]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:53.905 --> 01:22:55.306]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:02.110]  My name is Josh.
[01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:04.631]  One World Whey is the best in the market, hands down.
[01:23:04.631 --> 01:23:05.251]  I'm in the U.S.
[01:23:05.251 --> 01:23:07.432]  Navy, and I live a very active lifestyle.
[01:23:07.432 --> 01:23:10.193]  Being a vegetarian, it's hard getting all the protein I need.
[01:23:10.193 --> 01:23:13.935]  I tried their vegan protein powders, and I just wasn't feeling any change.
[01:23:13.935 --> 01:23:20.178]  The meathead supplement store whey protein kind of worked for a bit, but it left me feeling bloated, and my digestion seemed to slow down.
[01:23:20.178 --> 01:23:24.980]  By some divine stroke of luck, I heard a commercial of One World Whey on the radio, and it struck my interest.
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:27.542]  I have to tell you, I am so glad I got it.
[01:23:27.542 --> 01:23:30.745]  I have been taking it for a week and the results are amazing.
[01:23:30.745 --> 01:23:33.647]  I don't feel tired when I have to get up at 4.30 a.m.
[01:23:33.647 --> 01:23:35.308]  I look and feel better.
[01:23:35.308 --> 01:23:38.050]  I recover faster from my two workouts a day.
[01:23:38.050 --> 01:23:43.895]  When I don't have time to eat good food, I take it and I don't feel the urge to stuff my face for hours.
[01:23:43.895 --> 01:23:47.178]  I got up this morning and I looked the leanest I've looked since high school.
[01:23:47.178 --> 01:23:48.399]  I can go on and on.
[01:23:48.399 --> 01:23:51.021]  The best I can do to repay you is buy more and tell my friends.
[01:23:51.201 --> 01:23:54.043]  Call 888-988-3325.
[01:23:54.043 --> 01:23:56.866]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:23:56.866 --> 01:24:08.316]  Or visit OneWorldWHEY.com.
[01:24:08.316 --> 01:24:17.583]  So, Whitlock of Fox Sports says, if you own a gun or remember the NRA, you are a KKK racist.
[01:24:17.583 --> 01:24:17.904]  Period.
[01:24:19.130 --> 01:24:27.138]  Bob Costas picks up his column and agrees that handguns should basically be banned and guns are causing crime.
[01:24:27.138 --> 01:24:33.844]  And now Piers Morgan, we were just talking about foreigners being sent to run England, foreigners being sent to run other countries.
[01:24:33.844 --> 01:24:35.146]  That's the New World Order.
[01:24:35.146 --> 01:24:39.570]  Piers Morgan has called for a ban of all semi-autos on CNN.
[01:24:39.570 --> 01:24:41.452]  CNN anchor rants about gun control.
[01:24:42.483 --> 01:24:43.945]  So there you go.
[01:24:57.363 --> 01:25:01.505]  Second Amendment that Aaron and I put together, and then go back to Max here with us.
[01:25:01.505 --> 01:25:09.888]  And I'm excited to announce that Max is going to start doing 10-minute special reports for InfoWars Nightly News once a week, as well as joining us a few times a month.
[01:25:09.888 --> 01:25:11.369]  We're very honored to have him do that.
[01:25:11.369 --> 01:25:17.712]  And I should add that you should follow him at Twitter and also MaxKaiser.com.
[01:25:17.712 --> 01:25:20.593]  And we're going to put it up on screen, Max.
[01:25:20.593 --> 01:25:22.334]  It's at Max Kaiser.
[01:25:22.334 --> 01:25:24.135]  Very, very simple to follow you at Twitter.
[01:25:24.895 --> 01:25:31.438]  And I'm real Alex Jones, and I've got a at prison planet, but I don't know why I don't have a at real Alex Jones.
[01:25:31.438 --> 01:25:32.819]  We'll figure that out.
[01:25:32.819 --> 01:25:36.060]  But at Max Keiser, everybody should follow him there for all the updates.
[01:25:36.060 --> 01:25:40.042]  And I hope you're wrong, but I do see massive preparations for this.
[01:25:40.042 --> 01:25:41.143]  And look at this.
[01:25:41.143 --> 01:25:42.723]  Cops to Congress.
[01:25:42.723 --> 01:25:45.485]  We need logs of Americans text messages.
[01:25:45.485 --> 01:25:47.646]  CNET News guilty until proven innocent.
[01:25:47.646 --> 01:25:52.128]  Feds telling states to pass laws allowing highway checkpoints.
[01:25:52.968 --> 01:25:57.051]  TSA announces highway checkpoints in all 50 states.
[01:25:57.051 --> 01:25:59.193]  They're announcing capital controls.
[01:25:59.193 --> 01:26:02.416]  That you won't be able to leave the country now if they say you owe money.
[01:26:02.416 --> 01:26:05.038]  I mean, this is becoming Nazi Germany, Max Keiser.
[01:26:06.348 --> 01:26:13.451]  Well, it's not, the capital controls, it's not just even trying to leave money, leave the country across borders.
[01:26:13.451 --> 01:26:16.793]  The central banks don't trust each other.
[01:26:16.793 --> 01:26:21.796]  That's why the lending is not being made.
[01:26:21.796 --> 01:26:28.559]  A lot of people are complaining that the banks are not lending enough to stimulate business because the banks are hoarding cash.
[01:26:29.479 --> 01:26:44.075]  And they're hoarding cash because they don't trust each other, because they know that a credit freeze, like in 2008, or a collapse, as I'm predicting will come, they need that money on hand to pay themselves, basically.
[01:26:44.075 --> 01:26:45.877]  And they don't trust each other.
[01:26:45.877 --> 01:26:50.042]  This is another reason why, since 2009, the central banks have been buying gold.
[01:26:50.722 --> 01:26:53.104]  This year, they're going to be buying over 500 tons of gold.
[01:26:53.104 --> 01:26:54.765]  That's just the central banks.
[01:26:54.765 --> 01:27:09.076]  Also, starting next year, Alex, the Basel Agreement will classify gold for banks as a Tier 1 asset, which means that you can borrow 100 cents on the dollar against gold that you own.
[01:27:09.076 --> 01:27:11.858]  So, another big buyer of gold in 2013 will be banks.
[01:27:14.019 --> 01:27:21.524]  And China's doing it, universities are doing it, Soros is doing it, while simultaneously bad-mouthing it.
[01:27:21.524 --> 01:27:26.287]  I mean, a lot of this, for me, signals a bull market in gold.
[01:27:43.899 --> 01:27:44.399]  We're good to go.
[01:27:59.966 --> 01:28:02.368]  They're out all over the world accumulating gold.
[01:28:02.368 --> 01:28:09.173]  They want to get enough gold in-house to give them protection against that huge reserve of dollars that they have.
[01:28:09.173 --> 01:28:12.976]  They have three trillion paper money reserves, over a trillion of that.
[01:28:12.976 --> 01:28:16.599]  They're massively hedging with gold, and who else is doing that?
[01:28:16.599 --> 01:28:18.101]  Basically everybody.
[01:28:18.101 --> 01:28:22.965]  Well, Mexico has increased their gold position by thousands of percentage points.
[01:28:22.965 --> 01:28:24.466]  Korea's been buying gold.
[01:28:24.466 --> 01:28:25.727]  Every central bank in the world
[01:28:26.457 --> 01:28:33.244]  No, I make that... Many of the central banks in the world are buying gold.
[01:28:33.244 --> 01:28:38.028]  Some are famously not buying gold, like the Bank of England sold... What about all the fake tungsten?
[01:28:38.028 --> 01:28:39.710]  I heard you talking about that five years ago.
[01:28:39.710 --> 01:28:44.094]  It's surfacing in vaults and government and private central banks everywhere.
[01:28:44.094 --> 01:28:48.158]  Well, when the paper money collapses, you know, tungsten's not that bad a thing to have.
[01:28:49.656 --> 01:28:55.241]  You know, I mean, anything that's not paper is going to be valuable against a paper money apocalypse that's coming.
[01:28:55.241 --> 01:28:59.846]  But the tungsten has been an issue for years and years.
[01:28:59.846 --> 01:29:02.789]  I mean, it's one of the... another concern.
[01:29:02.789 --> 01:29:08.995]  I mean, you need to keep your head up and make sure you don't... Sure, my point is the gold-covered tungsten is surfacing everywhere.
[01:29:11.312 --> 01:29:17.600]  The big gold market, it's not enough of an issue to alter these big trends that we're seeing.
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:18.622]  No, no, I understand.
[01:29:18.622 --> 01:29:24.529]  I'm just saying that shows that these western banks don't have as much gold as they said they have.
[01:29:25.751 --> 01:29:27.932]  The bigger problem is that they've leased it out.
[01:29:27.932 --> 01:29:36.698]  This is why a lot of the gold in Central Bank's vaults that they've leased out, now there's a big question mark whether that gold is actually there.
[01:29:36.698 --> 01:29:44.442]  Contrast this with what we saw in the United States a couple of weeks ago when it was thought that... Okay Max, we're going to break.
[01:29:44.442 --> 01:29:46.043]  Your mic's distorting just a tad.
[01:29:46.043 --> 01:29:47.164]  You may want to back off a little bit.
[01:29:47.164 --> 01:29:50.766]  We're going to have a special report on guns and the attack on them in the back.
[01:29:50.766 --> 01:29:52.167]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.167 --> 01:29:53.688]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.708 --> 01:29:57.372]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:03.391 --> 01:30:11.497]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.

[01:31:01.465 --> 01:31:08.109]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[01:31:08.109 --> 01:31:10.491]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[01:31:10.491 --> 01:31:10.951]  The U.S.
[01:31:10.951 --> 01:31:15.174]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[01:31:15.174 --> 01:31:18.136]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[01:31:18.136 --> 01:31:19.637]  They want that attack to come.
[01:31:19.637 --> 01:31:25.821]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[01:31:26.212 --> 01:31:28.873]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[01:31:28.873 --> 01:31:33.836]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[01:31:33.836 --> 01:31:41.279]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready and won't be able to get out of town because there'll be absolute panic.
[01:31:41.579 --> 01:31:44.340]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[01:31:44.340 --> 01:31:47.441]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.
[01:31:47.441 --> 01:31:52.003]  Strategic Relocation Film with Joel Skousen and Alex Jones.
[01:31:52.003 --> 01:32:01.487]  Available only at InfoWarsShop.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:32:01.487 --> 01:32:07.310]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[01:32:08.231 --> 01:32:14.973]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.
[01:32:14.973 --> 01:32:25.036]  Our most popular silver-based products are the 32-ounce NanoSilver solutions, our 2-ounce NanoSilver nasal applicators, as well as our all-natural silver soaps.
[01:32:25.936 --> 01:32:30.057]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[01:32:30.057 --> 01:32:36.999]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[01:32:36.999 --> 01:32:47.402]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera, to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin, while delivering the silver more effectively.

[01:33:10.433 --> 01:33:15.478]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, waging war on corruption.
[01:33:15.478 --> 01:33:19.862]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:33:22.369 --> 01:33:32.897]  Bob Costas has responded to my call that he be fired if he does not apologize, and obviously others have been calling for that as well.
[01:33:32.897 --> 01:33:39.142]  He put out one clarification last night that basically said we were too stupid to understand what he was saying, so another slap in the face.
[01:33:39.142 --> 01:33:41.624]  We have a video about that up on InfoWars.com.
[01:33:41.624 --> 01:33:48.109]  We're about to premiere a detailed analysis of this, and then go back to Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com.
[01:33:48.109 --> 01:33:48.929]  He then went on
[01:33:49.810 --> 01:34:03.140]  And a new USA Today that has a transcript of here on the Dan Patrick Show today, this morning, saying that sometimes the quality of those who oppose you speaks for itself.
[01:34:04.011 --> 01:34:06.592]  And then he wanted to talk about racist.
[01:34:06.592 --> 01:34:07.793]  So now everything's racist.
[01:34:07.793 --> 01:34:09.413]  If you don't, you just say racist.
[01:34:09.413 --> 01:34:11.034]  It's like, oh, you want to own guns?
[01:34:11.034 --> 01:34:11.694]  You're racist.
[01:34:11.694 --> 01:34:14.136]  So he just said, well, there's some racism.
[01:34:14.136 --> 01:34:19.918]  And then he goes on to say, a discussion should ensue about the football culture, which is totally degenerate nowadays.
[01:34:19.918 --> 01:34:21.419]  And he added the gun culture.
[01:34:21.419 --> 01:34:24.720]  So they're trying to blame guns for the gangster culture.
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:26.061]  Domestic violence.
[01:34:26.061 --> 01:34:27.702]  So now guns are domestic violence.
[01:34:27.702 --> 01:34:30.163]  Those issues should be discussed if we're looking for some kind of
[01:34:30.763 --> 01:34:32.246]  Allusive perspective.
[01:34:32.246 --> 01:34:34.610]  Some more arrogant statements here.
[01:34:34.610 --> 01:34:41.743]  So, not a real apology, but he's gone from saying, oh, let me correct misinterpretations to, oh, let me correct mistakes.
[01:34:42.904 --> 01:34:44.925]  Two, but still you shouldn't be able to own guns.
[01:34:44.925 --> 01:34:47.046]  So, you need to be fired, Costas, okay?
[01:34:47.046 --> 01:34:48.387]  And everybody knows who you are.
[01:34:48.387 --> 01:34:51.708]  And there's going to be a boycott of the NFL because they authorized what you did.
[01:34:51.708 --> 01:34:52.829]  Same thing NBC.
[01:34:52.829 --> 01:35:01.873]  And Fox is, it all started with their columnist on Fox Sports saying the Second Amendment needs to be banned and anybody that owns guns are racist and whites are basically inherently bad people.
[01:35:02.453 --> 01:35:05.595]  And I guess that's what you see out of Rupert Murdoch right there.
[01:35:05.595 --> 01:35:08.097]  Just unbelievable how disgusting this is.
[01:35:08.097 --> 01:35:16.662]  We're going to air a report I did with Aaron Dykes on this premiering here, and then we're going to go right back to Max Keiser with where he, how he sees the collapse unfolding.
[01:35:16.662 --> 01:35:23.466]  Because unfortunately, it looks like he may be right, and it's an engineered collapse, and ways we can protect ourselves with Max Keiser.
[01:35:23.466 --> 01:35:24.767]  But first, here's this report.
[01:35:25.367 --> 01:35:31.431]  People who have credibility with young people should be on the television telling these youngsters that it's wrong to carry a gun.
[01:35:31.431 --> 01:35:33.172]  Ultimate tragedy, bloodied and dead.
[01:35:33.172 --> 01:35:36.654]  Javon Belcher's action, handguns do not enhance our safety.
[01:35:36.654 --> 01:35:41.157]  And just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[01:35:41.157 --> 01:35:44.259]  The assault weapons ban made sense.
[01:35:44.259 --> 01:35:51.024]  Well, the establishment's war against the right to keep and bear arms and the rest of our Bill of Rights is now reaching a high tide mark.
[01:35:51.744 --> 01:35:59.846]  You can make no mistake, Bob Costas, during Sunday Night Football on NBC, was declaring war on the Second Amendment.
[01:35:59.846 --> 01:36:02.267]  You want some actual perspective on this?
[01:36:02.267 --> 01:36:06.388]  Well, a bit of it comes from the Kansas City-based writer Jason Whitlock.
[01:36:06.388 --> 01:36:20.692]  Our current gun culture, Whitlock wrote, ensures that more and more domestic disputes will end in the ultimate tragedy, and that more convenience store confrontations over loud music coming from a car will leave more teenage boys bloodied and dead.
[01:36:21.192 --> 01:36:28.834]  And make no mistake, he was reading off a teleprompter at that time, and his remarks had all been pre-approved.
[01:36:28.834 --> 01:36:31.175]  Handguns do not enhance our safety.
[01:36:31.175 --> 01:36:38.477]  They exacerbate our flaws, tempt us to escalate arguments, and bait us into embracing confrontation rather than avoiding it.
[01:36:39.057 --> 01:36:46.983]  Turning the NFL into even more of a propaganda tool of the authoritarians that control Washington, D.C.
[01:36:46.983 --> 01:36:52.407]  If Javon Belcher didn't possess a gun, he and Cassandra Perkins would both be alive today.
[01:36:53.627 --> 01:37:05.118]  Leave it to NBC and Bob Costas to take a tragic event and try to capitalize on it to destroy the Second Amendment of our Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:37:05.118 --> 01:37:13.125]  Coming out and blaming a tragic shooting on the Second Amendment is asinine.
[01:37:13.125 --> 01:37:18.870]  It's like blaming obesity on spoons and forks, but that's exactly what he did.
[01:37:19.691 --> 01:37:25.279]  Costas really thinks we're stupid when he says, you know, there's a gun culture in the NFL.
[01:37:25.279 --> 01:37:29.024]  You mean the thug culture that's in the NFL?
[01:37:29.024 --> 01:37:31.327]  Pit bull fights and all the rest of it?
[01:37:31.327 --> 01:37:33.030]  You mean that culture?
[01:37:33.030 --> 01:37:34.752]  They're trying to claim that...
[01:37:35.413 --> 01:37:42.015]  The American gun culture is the thug culture that's in the NFL.
[01:37:42.015 --> 01:37:59.141]  Don't blame us for your culture of drugged out of their mind athletes on pain pills and psychotropic drugs like Prozac known to cause psychotic breaks and men who have had concussions after concussions after concussions going home and killing their families.
[01:37:59.921 --> 01:38:08.548]  And you notice Bob Costas says, I know in the days to come the NFL may get blamed, but you can't deny it's guns.
[01:38:08.548 --> 01:38:11.090]  If there wouldn't have been guns, this wouldn't have happened.
[01:38:11.090 --> 01:38:13.592]  He's saying, let's blame the Second Amendment.
[01:38:13.592 --> 01:38:16.615]  Let's blame one of the few rights left in this country.
[01:38:16.615 --> 01:38:21.719]  Let's not blame the NFL and the decadent gladiatorial spectacle it's become.
[01:38:22.918 --> 01:38:29.540]  The bureaucracy that's hijacked this country admits they're coming after our firearms.
[01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:32.441]  They have told us that they are doing this.
[01:38:32.441 --> 01:38:40.043]  Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced.
[01:38:40.043 --> 01:38:41.884]  An assault weapons ban reintroduced.
[01:38:41.884 --> 01:38:43.064]  Obama four years ago.
[01:38:44.150 --> 01:38:48.712]  Well, it's not surprising then that they get better at making claims to guns or religion.
[01:38:58.689 --> 01:39:10.643]  They point out the violence that's going on in the youth of this country, in places like Chicago and New York that have the highest crime rates in the United States, where they've completely banned guns for the general public.
[01:39:10.643 --> 01:39:16.711]  And then they point at Chicago and New York and say that's the reason that we need to turn our guns in, in places like Texas.
[01:39:17.051 --> 01:39:19.493]  Frankly, in my hometown of Chicago, there's an awful lot of violence.
[01:39:19.493 --> 01:39:22.315]  And they're not using AK-47s, they're using cheap handguns.
[01:39:22.315 --> 01:39:23.276]  It's incredible.
[01:39:23.276 --> 01:39:35.445]  They take the guns, the crime rates explode in those areas, while the crime rates drop in areas all over the United States, where you have a high rate of legal, lawful gun ownership.
[01:39:36.426 --> 01:39:41.770]  I expected the victim disarmament anti-defense crowd to come out and use this tragedy.
[01:39:41.770 --> 01:39:55.681]  But to see the NFL, NBC, via their frontman Bob Costas do it, lets you know that they are blowing the bugle, that they are charging in on our Second Amendment, and all the facts prove that that is what is now happening.
[01:39:55.681 --> 01:40:01.205]  None of us were under any illusion that reinstating that ban would be easy.
[01:40:02.399 --> 01:40:06.042]  And so what we focus on is existing laws.
[01:40:06.042 --> 01:40:16.248]  If the president would stage Fast and Furious, shipping guns into Mexico to demonize the Second Amendment and call for a gun ban, they will use any crisis out there to restrict our guns.
[01:40:16.248 --> 01:40:22.312]  Trafficking illegal firearms, sending them across the border, is illegal.
[01:40:22.312 --> 01:40:24.213]  That's something that we can stop.
[01:40:24.213 --> 01:40:30.057]  And so our focus is to work with Secretary Napolitano.
[01:40:30.057 --> 01:40:31.138]  Keep in mind, he did it.
[01:40:33.503 --> 01:40:40.548]  Now the reports are beginning to come out that Obama may use executive orders to restrict the Second Amendment because he can't get Congress to do it.
[01:40:40.548 --> 01:40:42.169]  He's already done that on cyber security.
[01:40:42.169 --> 01:40:44.050]  He's already done that shutting down power plants.
[01:40:44.050 --> 01:40:46.632]  He's already said NATO and the UN command our military.
[01:40:46.632 --> 01:40:48.734]  He is becoming a dictator more and more.
[01:40:48.734 --> 01:40:53.477]  They have asked the media to go out and blame everything on our right to keep and bear arms.
[01:40:54.037 --> 01:40:59.900]  People who have credibility with young people should be on the television telling these youngsters that it's wrong to carry a gun.
[01:40:59.900 --> 01:41:08.885]  So what you're seeing is part of the brainwashing that Attorney General Holder called for more than 15 years ago and is calling for again.
[01:41:08.885 --> 01:41:13.827]  And just really brainwashed people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[01:41:13.827 --> 01:41:22.772]  And the fact that Costas would be authorized to do something like this during Sunday football when the NFL lets you know they mean business.
[01:41:23.112 --> 01:41:27.015]  A corporate company man like Costas, you know he got it approved.
[01:41:27.015 --> 01:41:36.964]  So this is the NFL and NBC endorsing an attack on one of the few basic liberties that America has left.
[01:41:36.964 --> 01:41:39.426]  Unbelievably outrageous.
[01:41:39.426 --> 01:41:43.750]  And signals a coordinated attack on the Second Amendment.
[01:41:44.230 --> 01:41:55.633]  And if we won't speak out against this now, if we won't demand that Bob Costas at least apologize for using this tragedy, we're going to lose our Second Amendment.
[01:41:55.633 --> 01:41:57.173]  Now Hank Williams Jr.
[01:41:57.173 --> 01:42:00.534]  said this country was turning into a dictatorship and he was fired.
[01:42:00.534 --> 01:42:03.175]  You mean when John Boehner played golf with President Obama?
[01:42:04.553 --> 01:42:05.814]  Oh yeah!
[01:42:05.814 --> 01:42:08.596]  It'd be like Hitler playing golf with Netanyahu.
[01:42:08.596 --> 01:42:09.377]  Okay?
[01:42:09.377 --> 01:42:09.837]  Okay.
[01:42:09.837 --> 01:42:10.677]  Not hardly.
[01:42:10.677 --> 01:42:19.583]  All we're asking for is that Bob Costas apologize and that the NFL repudiate what was said as well as NBC.
[01:42:20.484 --> 01:42:27.489]  But if that is not done, I promise you this, and over 150 million other gun owners in this country do as well.
[01:42:27.489 --> 01:42:38.095]  We are not going to rest until the NFL loses a large portion of their audience and NBC sponsors are boycotted.
[01:42:38.095 --> 01:42:40.257]  It's time to turn off the NFL.
[01:42:40.257 --> 01:42:41.718]  It's time to turn off NBC.
[01:42:42.358 --> 01:42:47.580]  And it's time to stop watching that little globalist front man, Bob Costas.
[01:42:47.580 --> 01:42:52.002]  It's time to take it personal when they try to take our guns.
[01:42:52.002 --> 01:43:04.448]  That's why I'm calling for everyone to mail spoons with a note explaining to NBC that blaming guns for crime is like blaming spoons for fat people.
[01:43:04.448 --> 01:43:07.129]  And it's time to mail Bob Costas spoons.
[01:43:07.129 --> 01:43:10.851]  We're going to put the address under this video in the links below.
[01:43:11.411 --> 01:43:18.472]  And it's time to call the sponsors of NBC and the NFL and to let them know you're not going to support them either.
[01:43:18.472 --> 01:43:21.053]  It's time for the American people to stand up.
[01:43:21.053 --> 01:43:28.354]  It's time for the sleeping giant that is the United States of America to rediscover the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:43:28.354 --> 01:43:31.955]  These are our rights and you are not going to steal them.
[01:43:31.955 --> 01:43:33.616]  Do you understand this?
[01:43:33.616 --> 01:43:37.316]  The Second Amendment is the line in the sand.
[01:43:37.316 --> 01:43:40.257]  I'm Alex Jones, signing off for InfoWars.com.
[01:43:43.044 --> 01:43:49.708]  Alright, that video will be live the next 10 minutes at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and I will tweet it out at the real Alex Jones.
[01:43:49.708 --> 01:43:51.569]  Please retweet it.
[01:43:51.569 --> 01:43:54.031]  And again, also follow Max Keiser at MaxKeiser.com.
[01:43:54.031 --> 01:44:00.975]  Again, I apologize to Max for airing that, but Aaron stayed up all night to get it done and then we wanted it for the first hour, but we were behind and so we aired it now.
[01:44:00.975 --> 01:44:04.477]  We're always honored to have Max Keiser, but it's good to have that in the middle of the report as well.
[01:44:04.477 --> 01:44:06.278]  You've got the floor until we go to break, Max.
[01:44:07.298 --> 01:44:14.103]  Any comments on the gun thing, but getting back into your bold prediction that the collapse is really going to accelerate in April.
[01:44:14.103 --> 01:44:15.804]  You've already broken down why that's happening.
[01:44:15.804 --> 01:44:20.927]  We've got the head of the Bank of England saying what you're saying now, and you're in England right now.
[01:44:20.927 --> 01:44:22.248]  That's pretty creepy.
[01:44:22.248 --> 01:44:27.911]  So tell us what it'll look like and where it goes from there.
[01:44:27.911 --> 01:44:28.912]  Well, first of all, O.J.
[01:44:28.912 --> 01:44:30.153]  Simpson didn't have a gun.
[01:44:30.153 --> 01:44:33.395]  Didn't stop him from killing his wife.
[01:44:34.557 --> 01:44:35.379]  Wow, that's incredible.
[01:44:35.379 --> 01:44:38.445]  I actually made that point in the video, but Aaron cut it out for some reason.
[01:44:38.445 --> 01:44:46.200]  Yeah, Nicole Simpson, she did a nice with a concealed carry when OJ or whoever it was brought that knife to a gunfight.
[01:44:47.938 --> 01:44:48.739]  Yeah.
[01:44:48.739 --> 01:44:52.984]  Well, wasn't Bob Costas involved in a pedophile scandal with Sandusky for a while?
[01:44:52.984 --> 01:44:59.771]  He had him on his show and they were trying to cover that up for a while until Sandusky got on the show and basically admitted he was a pedophile.
[01:44:59.771 --> 01:45:05.337]  And then Bob, you see that image of him all shaken up, like, oh my God, I invited a pedophile on my show.
[01:45:05.337 --> 01:45:08.120]  And then he tried to, you know, talk his way out of it.
[01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:09.322]  So this guy's a loser.
[01:45:09.722 --> 01:45:19.704]  Anyway, talking about the collapse of the, you know, central bank system and fiat currencies around the world, this is, as I say, baked into the cake.
[01:45:19.704 --> 01:45:24.045]  Now, I believe we're going to see it by April of 2013.
[01:45:24.045 --> 01:45:29.146]  If I'm wrong, I will happily admit that I was wrong on my timing.
[01:45:29.146 --> 01:45:31.546]  You know, the trends are still there and still in place.
[01:45:31.546 --> 01:45:36.087]  Somebody else will get the timing perhaps better than I have, but I'm going to stick to my timing.
[01:45:36.687 --> 01:45:52.372]  But, you know, in the United States, it's remarkable that two weeks ago, three weeks ago, to give you an idea of the disconnect people have with what's happening in the central banks on Wall Street, remember when there was a threat they were going to close down the producer of Twinkies?
[01:45:52.372 --> 01:45:55.953]  And then within an hour, Twinkies were selling for $8,000 a Twinkie on eBay.
[01:45:58.214 --> 01:46:11.586]  Now that gives you an idea of the disconnect in the United States that the average person has with what the values are that run the system versus what the intrinsic value of a Twinkie actually is.
[01:46:11.586 --> 01:46:15.730]  So, you know, you have this remarkable explosion of Twinkie buying on eBay.
[01:46:16.010 --> 01:46:20.371]  Because people were scared that suddenly Twinkies would not be available anymore.
[01:46:20.371 --> 01:46:26.092]  And then that mania passed six hours or ten hours later, and it was on to some other mania.
[01:46:26.092 --> 01:46:37.815]  You know, people of course would probably get totally caught up in an NFL game over the weekend where they could watch steroid-driven drug addicts pound each other over the head for a million dollars a quarter.
[01:46:37.815 --> 01:46:38.215]  It's true.
[01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:43.422]  You know, so they're just going from distraction to distraction.
[01:46:43.422 --> 01:47:04.593]  Meanwhile, the main theme here that I need, I'm going to emphasize, is the central banks themselves that for 30, 40 years were colluding in pushing a financialization, a transactionalization, a world where work and labor was replaced with technocracy and money.
[01:47:05.433 --> 01:47:07.834]  They no longer trust each other.
[01:47:07.834 --> 01:47:09.916]  That is a fundamental difference today.
[01:47:09.916 --> 01:47:20.581]  Started in 2009 after the big collapse of 2008 and that and we know that they don't trust each other because they themselves are the biggest buyers of gold.
[01:47:20.581 --> 01:47:26.865]  Now here's the big moment that's going to change everything is when central banks who are now
[01:47:27.785 --> 01:47:39.753]  Issuing money or creating money through quantitative easing to buy government bonds, one of those central banks is going to break ranks and they're going to start printing money to buy gold.
[01:47:39.753 --> 01:47:49.499]  And that will be the moment when gold starts to go on a magnificent tear on the upside and the global sovereign bond market starts to collapse.
[01:47:49.499 --> 01:47:52.541]  Because one of these banks is going to say, enough is enough.
[01:47:52.541 --> 01:47:55.443]  The obvious contenders are China and Russia.
[01:47:56.497 --> 01:47:58.359]  Those are the obvious contenders.
[01:47:58.359 --> 01:48:04.346]  The obvious contenders for a currency collapse, hyperinflation we see in Japan and in the UK.
[01:48:04.346 --> 01:48:08.470]  The UK has a 900% debt to GDP.
[01:48:08.470 --> 01:48:10.692]  It's one of the worst in the world.
[01:48:10.692 --> 01:48:14.276]  So that's why we're here, because we're covering the collapse in London.
[01:48:14.276 --> 01:48:15.838]  And since we've been here, as you pointed out,
[01:48:16.318 --> 01:48:29.229]  The rhetoric coming out of the Bank of England is that quantitative easing doesn't work anymore, the debts are unsustainable, and the economy is collapsing, and there's very little that anyone can do.
[01:48:29.229 --> 01:48:32.572]  So that's pretty much the scenario up to this point.
[01:48:34.457 --> 01:48:38.941]  How is raising all these massive taxes in Europe and the United States going to fix things?
[01:48:38.941 --> 01:48:39.741]  They're not idiots.
[01:48:39.741 --> 01:48:48.389]  They know when they raise taxes on the poor and middle class, it's going to make these countries like Greece, Ireland, Spain, the United States go into cardiac arrest.
[01:48:48.389 --> 01:48:49.710]  But that's what they're doing.
[01:48:49.710 --> 01:49:00.179]  The Republicans and Democrats are debating how much taxes to raise instead of talking about trying to rebuild the country.
[01:49:00.179 --> 01:49:01.320]  What's your take on that?
[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:14.343]  Well, raising taxes will not increase the tax take at the end of the year because it'll put more people and companies out of business than any incremental gain on a marginal tax increase.
[01:49:14.343 --> 01:49:17.163]  So, net-net, the tax take is going to be worse.
[01:49:17.163 --> 01:49:29.086]  The reason I point to April of 2013 as my target date for the collapse is because I think the tax revenues reported for 2013 in the United States will be shockingly under estimates.
[01:49:29.446 --> 01:49:35.652]  And this will force the major rating agencies, Moody's, S&P, and Fitch, to downgrade the U.S.
[01:49:35.652 --> 01:49:36.173]  government bond.
[01:49:36.173 --> 01:49:38.975]  They've already downgraded it once.
[01:49:38.975 --> 01:49:40.557]  We think we're going to downgrade that again.
[01:49:40.557 --> 01:49:44.361]  But the establishment knows that, so they want to destroy the country.
[01:49:44.921 --> 01:49:46.443]  But the establishment is buying gold.
[01:49:46.443 --> 01:49:47.163]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:49:47.163 --> 01:50:02.518]  They're buying gold and silver because they don't trust each other and they know that in extremis, even Alan Greenspan famously said that we learned from the collapse of Germany in the 40s that in extremis, only gold is counted as money.
[01:50:04.299 --> 01:50:15.375]  And Alan Greenspan, of course, is the maestro of the central bank, that is the creator of the bubbles that, of course, are the monster that ate the global economy.
[01:50:15.375 --> 01:50:19.060]  So for him to even point this out is quite significant.
[01:50:19.640 --> 01:50:32.508]  And this is unknown amongst those who understand the history of banking and money, that when you have this type of crisis, gold is really the only extinguisher of debt, is one way to put it.
[01:50:32.508 --> 01:50:36.431]  Sure, and then you continue to kind of put things off, but there's still that slow slide.
[01:50:36.431 --> 01:50:39.013]  I mean, the economy worldwide is getting worse and worse.
[01:50:39.013 --> 01:50:40.534]  I want to come back and ask you, Max.
[01:50:41.314 --> 01:50:47.837]  Well, slow slide, it's deceptive because if you look at a chart like Enron, remember Enron?
[01:50:47.837 --> 01:50:50.998]  The stock went from $2 to $90.
[01:50:50.998 --> 01:50:52.779]  Stay there, explain it to us on the other side.
[01:50:52.779 --> 01:50:55.900]  And then I want to ask you, will these globalists get away with it?
[01:50:55.900 --> 01:50:58.361]  Or is there any way to arrest them?
[01:50:58.361 --> 01:50:59.802]  And then how would you fix the economy?
[01:50:59.802 --> 01:51:02.163]  We'll be right back with Max Geiser.
[01:51:02.163 --> 01:51:08.366]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard?
[01:51:08.792 --> 01:51:11.274]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Skousen.
[01:51:11.274 --> 01:51:11.634]  The U.S.
[01:51:11.634 --> 01:51:15.856]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[01:51:15.856 --> 01:51:18.818]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[01:51:18.818 --> 01:51:20.319]  They want that attack to come.
[01:51:20.319 --> 01:51:26.523]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[01:51:26.883 --> 01:51:29.565]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[01:51:29.565 --> 01:51:34.527]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[01:51:34.527 --> 01:51:42.272]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready, won't be able to get out of town, because there'll be absolute panic.
[01:51:42.272 --> 01:51:45.033]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[01:51:45.033 --> 01:51:47.615]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.

[01:52:02.728 --> 01:52:04.949]  Hey there, Frank Bates here.
[01:52:04.949 --> 01:52:10.030]  Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans?
[01:52:10.030 --> 01:52:11.830]  This is really scary stuff.
[01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:17.092]  Defense experts warn that this odd device poses the greatest threat we've ever known.
[01:52:17.092 --> 01:52:24.294]  In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat.
[01:52:25.134 --> 01:52:27.935]  I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.
[01:52:27.935 --> 01:52:31.716]  It may be because the liberals in the government are trying to cover it up.
[01:52:31.716 --> 01:52:40.258]  That's why my friend just created a free video at WeirdDevice.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors off the conspiracy.
[01:52:40.258 --> 01:52:50.421]  Go watch the shocking video at WeirdDevice.com right now to discover exactly what it is, plus discover the number one way you and your family can survive this deadly attack.
[01:52:51.141 --> 01:52:56.523]  I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to WeirdDevice.com before it's gone forever.
[01:52:56.523 --> 01:53:00.544]  Again, that's WeirdDevice.com.
[01:53:00.544 --> 01:53:05.325]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:53:05.325 --> 01:53:08.366]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:53:08.366 --> 01:53:16.669]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:53:17.319 --> 01:53:22.880]  Now, 27 years later, carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[01:54:05.925 --> 01:54:11.807]  We're doing a little bit of overdrive here into the next hour with Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com.
[01:54:11.807 --> 01:54:14.068]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:54:14.068 --> 01:54:15.008]  Christmas is here.
[01:54:15.008 --> 01:54:16.228]  It's time to wake folks up.
[01:54:16.228 --> 01:54:23.151]  We've got the new issue of InfoWars magazine that will be sold out by the end of the day if you want to buy it in bulk at cost.
[01:54:23.151 --> 01:54:27.192]  You can also get a 12-issue subscription, a great gift to give people.
[01:54:27.192 --> 01:54:30.613]  If 12 magazines, glossy, full of info won't wake them up,
[01:54:31.033 --> 01:54:32.194]  Not much will.
[01:54:32.194 --> 01:54:37.757]  We're also selling 10 PrisonPlanet.tv memberships for the price of one, so you can give them to friends and family.
[01:54:37.757 --> 01:54:39.158]  Handle all your shopping.
[01:54:39.158 --> 01:54:40.738]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:54:40.738 --> 01:54:48.543]  And we have the ProPures until December 10th at 15% off the great water filters at InfowarStore.com.
[01:54:48.543 --> 01:54:49.983]  Going back to Max Keiser.
[01:54:49.983 --> 01:54:50.724]  Okay, Max, go ahead.
[01:54:50.724 --> 01:54:56.567]  You've got the floor with the point you were making about any way to arrest these bankers, any way to bring them to justice.
[01:54:56.567 --> 01:54:57.848]  But you were making another point as well.
[01:54:58.533 --> 01:55:24.940]  Yeah, no, you know, the guests on your show you've had, and we've talked about this collapse coming, and you know, the question always is when, and I think that it's, you know, if you're standing on the surface of the Earth, you know, it's tough to see that you're actually standing on a round object, because it's a very large object, and this crisis is very large, but when it happens, it'll happen quite quickly, because this is
[01:55:25.100 --> 01:55:28.101]  An historic bubble we're talking about for bonds.
[01:55:28.101 --> 01:55:33.603]  You have to go back and compare to, let's say, the tulip bulb mania in Holland in 1634.
[01:55:33.603 --> 01:55:39.985]  The price of tulip bulbs went from 1.5 to 60 to 0.
[01:55:39.985 --> 01:55:45.888]  In France, during the Mississippi bubble, the stock in that Ponzi scheme went from 500
[01:55:47.728 --> 01:55:49.789]  18,000 to zero.
[01:55:49.789 --> 01:55:51.129]  The South Sea bubble of 1720.
[01:55:51.129 --> 01:55:55.811]  The stock went from 100 to 1,000 to 100.
[01:55:55.811 --> 01:56:01.613]  More recently with Enron, the stock went from $2 to 90 to zero.
[01:56:01.613 --> 01:56:04.454]  What I'm saying is that the government bonds in America, the U.S.
[01:56:04.454 --> 01:56:09.876]  Treasury bond, has never been higher in 240 years.
[01:56:09.876 --> 01:56:15.358]  The Treasury bond in the UK has never been higher in 300 years.
[01:56:15.358 --> 01:56:16.839]  And when the bubble pops,
[01:56:17.619 --> 01:56:26.262]  It'll collapse by 50, 60, 70 percent with lightning speed, as we've seen with these other historic bubbles.
[01:56:26.262 --> 01:56:29.183]  So it'll be too late to do anything at that time.
[01:56:29.183 --> 01:56:31.004]  You have to be prepared beforehand.
[01:56:31.004 --> 01:56:38.167]  And if you want proof of what I'm saying is true, look at what these central banks are doing.
[01:56:38.167 --> 01:56:41.868]  Since 1971, they were net sellers of gold and they bought paper.
[01:56:42.108 --> 01:56:49.715]  From 2009, after the collapse of 2008 of Lehman Brothers, they became net buyers of gold.
[01:56:49.715 --> 01:56:52.197]  They're buying over 500 tons this year.
[01:56:52.197 --> 01:56:59.384]  And because they don't trust each other, because they know this bubble is about to pop, I always go with the money.
[01:56:59.384 --> 01:57:00.505]  I go with the smart money.
[01:57:00.825 --> 01:57:04.409]  China has the money and they're smart enough to be buying gold.
[01:57:04.409 --> 01:57:11.737]  The central bankers have the money and pretty soon they're going to be issuing money to buy gold instead of the bonds that are in this huge bubble.
[01:57:11.737 --> 01:57:15.902]  And so those are the factors that we see in front of our face.
[01:57:15.902 --> 01:57:19.245]  And we know that when this bubble pops, this historic bubble,
[01:57:20.046 --> 01:57:22.708]  Like NASDAQ, from 1981 to 2000, it went from 100 to 5,000, then crashed to 1,500.
[01:57:22.708 --> 01:57:25.209]  In Nikkei, remember the Nikkei bubble from 1970 to 1992, it went from 3,000 to 40,000, then crashed to 8,000.
[01:57:25.209 --> 01:57:28.691]  At one point, you had in Japan that the land under the Royal Palace was worth more than the entire state of California.
[01:57:28.691 --> 01:57:29.372]  And once that happened?
[01:57:43.780 --> 01:57:45.260]  No, no, you're saying it's coming to an end.
[01:57:45.260 --> 01:57:48.321]  It's obviously the biggest bubble in 300 years.
[01:57:48.321 --> 01:57:51.762]  You're saying it begins to pop or will pop coming up on April 15th or thereafter.
[01:57:51.762 --> 01:57:52.382]  How bad will it be?
[01:58:12.516 --> 01:58:19.660]  It'll be, it'll be the worst financial crisis in 100 years, 150 years.
[01:58:19.660 --> 01:58:21.441]  Absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt.
[01:58:21.441 --> 01:58:33.647]  I've talked to a lot of big insiders, including well-known billionaires, and they've said the word is, all these companies are pulling back and digging in, and so there's a lot of signs this is coming.
[01:58:33.647 --> 01:58:34.328]  We're going to go to break.
[01:58:34.328 --> 01:58:35.808]  Come back a little bit more with Max Keiser.
[01:58:35.808 --> 01:58:37.289]  I'm Alex Jones of InfoWars.com.
[01:58:37.289 --> 01:58:39.610]  You can follow Max at Max Keiser.
[01:58:39.610 --> 01:58:40.551]  I'm at RealAlexJones.
[01:58:42.148 --> 01:58:45.693]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.693 --> 01:58:52.823]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:52.823 --> 01:58:57.710]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the east, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[01:58:58.425 --> 01:59:01.648]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[01:59:01.648 --> 01:59:04.471]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[01:59:04.471 --> 01:59:07.493]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[01:59:07.493 --> 01:59:10.997]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[01:59:10.997 --> 01:59:16.201]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[01:59:16.201 --> 01:59:18.884]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.
[01:59:18.884 --> 01:59:21.907]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[01:59:22.527 --> 01:59:24.628]  I'm taking control of my future.
[01:59:24.628 --> 01:59:26.269]  And you're nuts if you don't do the same.

[01:59:37.113 --> 01:59:42.595]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:59:42.595 --> 01:59:45.736]  Would you rather prepare six months too early or one day too late?
[01:59:45.736 --> 01:59:50.218]  409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:59:54.528 --> 01:59:56.930]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.930 --> 02:00:05.477]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.477 --> 02:00:06.778]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.778 --> 02:00:08.560]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.560 --> 02:00:10.301]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.301 --> 02:00:11.902]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.902 --> 02:00:13.804]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.804 --> 02:00:17.647]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.647 --> 02:00:21.750]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.092 --> 02:00:27.433]  We will continue with your calls in this segment.
[02:00:27.433 --> 02:00:30.715]  And those of you that are holding, you're going to get to talk to Gerald Cilente.
[02:00:30.715 --> 02:00:35.597]  Just address your comments or questions to him because he's pretty much in the same vein as we are on many fronts.
[02:00:35.597 --> 02:00:36.257]  Smart guy.
[02:00:36.257 --> 02:00:41.920]  So, once we get to your calls, after he talks about 30 minutes, just have a question for him.
[02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:43.701]  Or you can hang up and somebody else can get on board.
[02:00:43.701 --> 02:00:45.782]  I'm about to talk to Christina.
[02:00:46.621 --> 02:00:48.322]  And some others that are patiently holding.
[02:00:48.322 --> 02:00:52.545]  And then we'll continue to go through a whole cornucopia of news with Gerald Cilente.
[02:00:52.545 --> 02:00:58.088]  A bunch of key topics coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:58.088 --> 02:01:02.811]  But first off, let's go to Christina in Texas on the Second Amendment.
[02:01:02.811 --> 02:01:05.653]  Hey, Bob Costas doubled and tripled down.
[02:01:05.653 --> 02:01:09.135]  He says people, men, should not be able to own guns.
[02:01:09.135 --> 02:01:13.958]  Ages 20 to 30, we cannot be trusted.
[02:01:13.958 --> 02:01:15.039]  What do you make of that, Christina?
[02:01:17.245 --> 02:01:21.947]  Um, I only own one gun right now, but plan on getting a few.
[02:01:21.947 --> 02:01:23.707]  My boyfriend has several.
[02:01:23.707 --> 02:01:26.268]  So, we're kind of keeping an eye on that.
[02:01:26.268 --> 02:01:28.289]  Well, I hope he's not 20 to 30 years old.
[02:01:28.289 --> 02:01:30.610]  Bob Costas says those are bad people.
[02:01:30.610 --> 02:01:32.071]  Men are bad.
[02:01:32.071 --> 02:01:33.211]  I'm actually 30.
[02:01:33.211 --> 02:01:36.232]  He's 8 years older than me.
[02:01:36.232 --> 02:01:37.693]  Oh, well, good.
[02:01:37.693 --> 02:01:39.553]  You can't have 30 year olds with guns.
[02:01:39.553 --> 02:01:41.114]  Good, good.
[02:01:41.114 --> 02:01:42.354]  Bob Costas said so.
[02:01:42.354 --> 02:01:43.355]  A little runt.
[02:01:43.355 --> 02:01:43.755]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:01:44.810 --> 02:01:53.296]  Now, I had heard something several months ago, and I've been trying to find information on it, and I can't really.
[02:01:53.296 --> 02:02:02.822]  Something about after they take the guns, the UN goes through and starts taking the guns, that they might send troops in through the Texas border to get into the US.
[02:02:02.822 --> 02:02:04.904]  Well, look, it won't be a sneak attack.
[02:02:04.904 --> 02:02:10.407]  They've got police exchange programs where they send our police over to Europe and then come over here to Japan, vice versa.
[02:02:11.488 --> 02:02:17.050]  To where you'll be arrested under international law and taken to the Hague for your free speech and drug off.
[02:02:17.050 --> 02:02:21.352]  And they're just acclimating our troops when you now hear about NATO deaths in Afghanistan.
[02:02:21.352 --> 02:02:25.334]  So it'll just be that foreign troops are phased into our military.
[02:02:25.334 --> 02:02:26.314]  In L.E.O.
[02:02:26.314 --> 02:02:32.657]  9, they started publicly admitting troops from 15 nations here training to quote, back up American forces under NORTHCOM.
[02:02:33.757 --> 02:02:39.902]  Terrorist attack and it listed them as domestic extremists and they drilled not to fight Muslim extremists.
[02:02:39.902 --> 02:02:41.723]  That's for the public consumption.
[02:02:41.723 --> 02:02:44.665]  They drill to fight veterans.
[02:02:44.665 --> 02:02:46.906]  I can show you the New York Times on that.
[02:02:46.906 --> 02:02:49.128]  They drill to kill veterans.
[02:02:49.128 --> 02:02:50.849]  So that's how it'll work.
[02:02:50.849 --> 02:02:53.671]  It won't be UN troops show up like Red Dawn.
[02:02:53.671 --> 02:03:01.196]  It's that, you know, these are we got footage in Chicago of foreign troops training with our military to put citizens in the sports dome.
[02:03:03.107 --> 02:03:17.636]  A couple years back when she was living in Livingston in Texas, she told me about y'all show and at the time unfortunately I was working for a private ice facility in Livingston right next to the Polonsky unit.
[02:03:17.636 --> 02:03:26.561]  I worked for TDC for a while as well and it took me several years after I got severely hurt on that unit.
[02:03:26.561 --> 02:03:29.663]  I almost died from an inmate assault.
[02:03:29.663 --> 02:03:31.464]  Oddly enough we were shorthanded that night.
[02:03:32.313 --> 02:03:36.195]  And, uh, I also refused to forge paperwork.
[02:03:36.195 --> 02:03:38.096]  I wouldn't, I wouldn't forge any paperwork.
[02:03:38.096 --> 02:03:41.517]  I wouldn't forge any documents and say, I did it.
[02:03:41.517 --> 02:03:45.939]  So, and I had called them and let them know something was wrong and nobody came down.
[02:03:45.939 --> 02:03:50.281]  And I ended up with a broken jaw in two places and almost had my throat slit open.
[02:03:50.281 --> 02:03:50.961]  Well, that's what they do.
[02:03:50.961 --> 02:03:55.203]  They probably told the, I mean, statistically, they probably sent the inmate to kill you.
[02:03:55.203 --> 02:03:59.845]  Yeah, that's, uh, now that I'm out of the system and I'm, uh, programming is,
[02:04:01.149 --> 02:04:07.654]  I mean, you know the big private prisons.
[02:04:07.654 --> 02:04:08.614]  That's the model.
[02:04:08.614 --> 02:04:13.678]  They put the gangs in charge and then let them sell the drugs to everybody and it's totally corrupt.
[02:04:13.678 --> 02:04:16.019]  And then the jail guards don't have to really do anything.
[02:04:16.019 --> 02:04:16.980]  I mean, that's the model.
[02:04:16.980 --> 02:04:18.821]  And then that's a new enforcement army.
[02:04:18.821 --> 02:04:22.204]  Those are colleges to roll those gangs out against the American people.
[02:04:22.204 --> 02:04:25.466]  And then they work for the Feds.
[02:04:25.466 --> 02:04:27.627]  That's on record.
[02:04:27.627 --> 02:04:29.689]  Max Keiser's written about it, but I mean, it's on record.
[02:04:31.184 --> 02:04:35.346]  I don't know about those ICE units, but that's pretty much par for the course.
[02:04:35.346 --> 02:04:36.647]  I mean, that's like Serpico.
[02:04:36.647 --> 02:04:38.488]  He wouldn't take drug money and stuff.
[02:04:38.488 --> 02:04:44.490]  All the other detectives were on drugs, you know, drug money and other things, because once you do that, why not do other stuff?
[02:04:44.490 --> 02:04:46.891]  And, you know, they shot him in the face.
[02:04:46.891 --> 02:04:49.012]  So that's what they do.
[02:04:49.012 --> 02:04:54.274]  A lot of departments aren't that corrupt, but big city ones generally are.
[02:04:54.274 --> 02:04:59.777]  I've got to say, I don't have evidence the Austin Police Department is a mafia, which is very rare in big cities.
[02:05:01.778 --> 02:05:03.780]  This man wants your guns.
[02:05:03.780 --> 02:05:09.203]  That is the cover of the 60-page glossy magazine, jam-packed with information.
[02:05:09.203 --> 02:05:12.306]  The December issue of InfoWars Magazine.

[02:06:08.510 --> 02:06:09.451]  With ProPure.

[02:06:43.179 --> 02:06:45.921]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.

[02:08:09.306 --> 02:08:11.050]  You got a business.
[02:08:11.050 --> 02:08:12.814]  You didn't build that.
[02:08:12.814 --> 02:08:14.498]  Somebody else made that happen.
[02:08:18.314 --> 02:08:21.777]  That's right, and you can't have a Christmas tree, either.
[02:08:21.777 --> 02:08:23.498]  And you gotta get that, uh, look.
[02:08:23.498 --> 02:08:29.363]  From enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:29.363 --> 02:08:31.145]  Only I can interrupt myself.
[02:08:31.145 --> 02:08:32.486]  I actually do that.
[02:08:32.486 --> 02:08:37.971]  Sometimes we're playing a report I've done, and then I'll be interrupting, stopping my own reporter talking over myself.
[02:08:37.971 --> 02:08:40.373]  I don't know, I just think about stuff, I wanna talk about it.
[02:08:41.013 --> 02:08:41.633]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:08:41.633 --> 02:08:47.937]  You didn't build that, and you're not allowed to have a Christmas tree, even in your front yard now.
[02:08:47.937 --> 02:08:50.198]  They say it offends people, so it's gotta go.
[02:08:50.198 --> 02:08:51.379]  It's evil.
[02:08:51.379 --> 02:08:54.900]  First Amendment, though, says you can do whatever you want religious.
[02:08:54.900 --> 02:09:03.705]  Instead, the government's violating the First Amendment with faith-based initiative, tens of billions of dollars a year to fund and control your churches.
[02:09:03.705 --> 02:09:05.166]  That is unconstitutional.
[02:09:06.189 --> 02:09:10.752]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[02:09:10.752 --> 02:09:17.256]  For the rest of the hour, maybe five minutes of overdrive, we are joined by Gerald Cilente.
[02:09:17.256 --> 02:09:26.302]  You can go online and you can see his different websites, geraldcilente.com, transresearch.com, transjournal.com.
[02:09:26.302 --> 02:09:28.884]  They all take you to the same place, an amazing website.
[02:09:28.884 --> 02:09:34.368]  You can see there, if you type in Gerald Cilente, who do people associate with Gerald Cilente?
[02:09:34.368 --> 02:09:35.809]  Alex Jones, Peter Schiff,
[02:09:36.369 --> 02:09:39.152]  Mark Faubourg, Max Keiser and Jim Rogers.
[02:09:39.152 --> 02:09:42.075]  And that is... I agree with all those guys.
[02:09:42.075 --> 02:09:44.697]  That is quite... It's good to be in that company.
[02:09:44.697 --> 02:09:51.203]  Because I was just typing in Gerald Cilente to see the latest news on him during the break and noticed that I'm honored to be up there.
[02:09:51.203 --> 02:09:55.707]  I think out of all those people, the most with Gerald Cilente and Max Keiser.
[02:09:55.707 --> 02:09:56.909]  Jim Rogers is a great guy.
[02:09:58.656 --> 02:09:58.676]  I
[02:10:19.447 --> 02:10:20.948]  We've kind of done an informal poll.
[02:10:20.948 --> 02:10:24.910]  I think Gerald Salenta, I don't think I know, is the most popular guest on this show.
[02:10:24.910 --> 02:10:26.631]  So without further ado, I'm going to shut up.
[02:10:26.631 --> 02:10:30.093]  You know, Gerald asked, hey, what topics do you want me on about via email?
[02:10:30.093 --> 02:10:32.574]  And I said, hey, why don't you send the topics?
[02:10:32.574 --> 02:10:35.096]  So we're going to go through the topics he wants to cover.
[02:10:35.096 --> 02:10:36.897]  And a bunch of these are what I would have covered already.
[02:10:36.897 --> 02:10:39.859]  So I'm glad we're of one mind on many fronts, I guess.
[02:10:40.899 --> 02:10:45.362]  Minds that love freedom think the same, think alike.
[02:10:45.362 --> 02:10:47.384]  And we'll go through some of these points.
[02:10:47.384 --> 02:10:50.466]  Gerald, everything is accelerating.
[02:10:50.466 --> 02:10:59.273]  Just as you predicted, in Europe they have these fake fiscal cliffs that then terrorize everyone into more banker bailout money as the bankers exempt themselves.
[02:10:59.273 --> 02:11:02.976]  You wanted to get into the fiscal cliff first.
[02:11:02.976 --> 02:11:04.397]  The Republicans want to rape us first.
[02:11:04.597 --> 02:11:09.078]  Well, first of all, you know, we've been hearing about this fiscal cliff now, what?
[02:11:09.078 --> 02:11:10.419]  It's about a week before election day.
[02:11:10.419 --> 02:11:12.459]  It's going on over a month.
[02:11:12.459 --> 02:11:18.321]  And, you know, the toilet paper record, the New York Times, calls what I do pessimism porn, when I warn about something.
[02:11:34.701 --> 02:11:40.445]  But boy are they selling pessimism porn with this fiscal cliff.
[02:11:40.445 --> 02:11:42.166]  You can't get it out of your head.
[02:11:42.166 --> 02:11:45.128]  They're hitting every hour every day with it.
[02:11:45.128 --> 02:11:48.511]  And they're making a lot more out of it than it is.
[02:11:48.511 --> 02:11:51.293]  Because it's not just the fiscal cliff.
[02:11:51.293 --> 02:11:54.995]  It's a much bigger story than that, but they're not telling the whole story.
[02:11:56.041 --> 02:11:57.482]  And the story is this.
[02:11:57.482 --> 02:12:09.169]  They've synthesized it down that, well, you know, we'll go over the fiscal cliff if we don't cut the budget deficit, the federal budget deficit, because it's out of line.
[02:12:09.169 --> 02:12:13.392]  And the way we're going to do it is, oh, we have two ideas.
[02:12:13.392 --> 02:12:22.198]  Because we're only the Republicans and the Democrats, we can only come up with two ideas because we're too damn stupid to think of anything more.
[02:12:22.198 --> 02:12:25.340]  We'll call ourselves the incompetents and the inepts.
[02:12:25.820 --> 02:12:27.682]  I got an idea!
[02:12:27.682 --> 02:12:29.844]  Let's cut spending!
[02:12:29.844 --> 02:12:31.265]  Okay, great!
[02:12:31.265 --> 02:12:33.427]  I got another idea!
[02:12:33.427 --> 02:12:35.269]  Let's talk about taxes.
[02:12:35.269 --> 02:12:38.352]  We'll either increase them or we'll decrease them.
[02:12:38.352 --> 02:12:39.813]  That's the end of the story.
[02:12:39.813 --> 02:12:42.276]  That's how far these morons go.
[02:12:42.276 --> 02:12:44.037]  Why don't we talk about the whole issue here?
[02:12:45.003 --> 02:12:51.588]  If you're going to cut spending, and you're going to increase taxes, guess what you're going to do, moron?
[02:12:51.588 --> 02:12:54.590]  You're going to slow down the economy!
[02:12:54.590 --> 02:12:57.833]  Hey, the economy's not slowing down enough for you?
[02:12:57.833 --> 02:13:00.214]  Let's really put the brakes on it!
[02:13:00.214 --> 02:13:01.916]  Then what does it do?
[02:13:01.916 --> 02:13:04.778]  Well, 70% of the GDP in the United States
[02:13:06.739 --> 02:13:09.702]  Is consumer spending 70%?
[02:13:09.702 --> 02:13:12.144]  Yeah, that's right!
[02:13:12.144 --> 02:13:14.907]  Because they sold out the country!
[02:13:14.907 --> 02:13:17.630]  They offshored our manufacturing!
[02:13:17.630 --> 02:13:19.271]  You remember it!
[02:13:19.271 --> 02:13:22.354]  Bill Clinton, that wonderful liberal!
[02:13:22.354 --> 02:13:24.797]  Yeah, the debate with Ross Perot and Al Gore!
[02:13:25.177 --> 02:13:25.958]  Yeah!
[02:13:25.958 --> 02:13:27.679]  Oh, we're going to have great jobs.
[02:13:27.679 --> 02:13:30.020]  We don't need those manufacturing jobs.
[02:13:30.020 --> 02:13:32.461]  We can have service sector jobs.
[02:13:32.461 --> 02:13:33.862]  Oh, service sector.
[02:13:33.862 --> 02:13:34.683]  Service?
[02:13:34.683 --> 02:13:35.523]  Servitude.
[02:13:35.523 --> 02:13:36.124]  Right!
[02:13:36.124 --> 02:13:38.025]  You get to be a cashier.
[02:13:38.025 --> 02:13:41.587]  You could stock shelves at Walmart.
[02:13:41.587 --> 02:13:43.208]  Oh, you could be on a call center.
[02:13:43.208 --> 02:13:46.790]  The ones that we still have here that they haven't shipped to India or the Philippines.
[02:13:47.230 --> 02:13:57.604]  So now, you're going to cut spending, you're going to increase taxes, you're going to slow down the economy, less people work, less tax revenues come in.
[02:13:57.604 --> 02:13:58.726]  Brilliant!
[02:13:58.726 --> 02:14:02.291]  So how are we going to solve this problem?
[02:14:03.865 --> 02:14:05.205]  It's very simple.
[02:14:05.205 --> 02:14:06.926]  And no one will talk about it.
[02:14:06.926 --> 02:14:08.646]  Why won't they talk about it?
[02:14:08.646 --> 02:14:11.006]  Because of the Gambinos and the Bananos.
[02:14:11.006 --> 02:14:14.647]  The two crime families that made these problems happen.
[02:14:14.647 --> 02:14:22.589]  So how could any imbecile, any thinking person, look upon the people that caused the problem to solve it?
[02:14:22.589 --> 02:14:23.889]  They can't.
[02:14:23.889 --> 02:14:29.270]  The way you solve it is, number one, bring the jobs back home.
[02:14:30.111 --> 02:14:34.030]  Put back in place what Bill Clinton took away from us!
[02:14:34.972 --> 02:14:38.754]  What George W. Bush accelerated.
[02:14:38.754 --> 02:14:44.518]  And what Obama keeps going by bragging that we're making up more trade deals there.
[02:14:44.518 --> 02:14:46.739]  Oh yeah, you know what a trade deal is?
[02:14:46.739 --> 02:14:47.920]  Very simple.
[02:14:47.920 --> 02:14:54.583]  Hey, how about that lovely fire over there in Bangladesh that killed over a hundred people in the sweatshop?
[02:14:54.583 --> 02:15:03.629]  A trade deal means you take all of your manufacturing, anything that's service, anything that you could do, bring it to a slave labor country,
[02:15:04.309 --> 02:15:06.372]  And then bring it back and mark the price up.
[02:15:23.232 --> 02:15:32.536]  You know, in 94, in those debates with Ross Perot and Larry King, and they all laughed at Ross Perot when he said it was a giant sucking sound, but guess what it was?
[02:15:32.536 --> 02:15:43.281]  And then they have tax incentives to move the jobs overseas, and they spend 21, 22 billion dollars to move Cadillac and Volt factories to China and Brazil, and that's a good deal, Gerald!
[02:15:43.281 --> 02:15:46.643]  They're gonna bail out General Motors by moving it overseas!
[02:15:46.643 --> 02:15:49.284]  I mean, they are gutting this country.
[02:15:49.864 --> 02:15:50.845]  Exactly.
[02:15:50.845 --> 02:15:53.426]  So the fiscal cliff is a lot of crap.
[02:15:53.426 --> 02:15:54.947]  That's what I'm trying to say.
[02:15:54.947 --> 02:15:55.748]  And you nailed it.
[02:15:55.748 --> 02:15:57.609]  You put all the details into it.
[02:15:57.609 --> 02:15:59.811]  So the first one is that.
[02:15:59.811 --> 02:16:08.797]  The second one is put back the regulations that gave the people in this country an even shot at the deal.
[02:16:09.637 --> 02:16:17.525]  And those regulations, you know, from the 19th to the 20th century, the robber barons were taking over the country.
[02:16:17.525 --> 02:16:19.687]  Now they just got different names!
[02:16:19.687 --> 02:16:29.517]  They got names like private equity groups, hedge funds, yeah, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs gang, all of these companies that have taken over all the whole
[02:16:30.718 --> 02:16:37.942]  The whole country, whether it's in retail, whether it's in agriculture, whether it's in communication.
[02:16:37.942 --> 02:16:44.186]  And they take the money they suck and move it to a third world hell pit to sell us junk back to dig the hole deeper.
[02:16:44.186 --> 02:16:47.948]  They're waging economic war against us.
[02:16:47.948 --> 02:16:50.129]  They're enslaving us.
[02:16:50.129 --> 02:16:52.491]  It's a plantation economy.
[02:16:53.564 --> 02:16:55.305]  That's all it is!
[02:16:55.305 --> 02:16:57.326]  You're looking, I'm not making this up!
[02:16:57.326 --> 02:17:06.311]  You look at the median household income has fallen over 10% since the Great Recession began in 2008.
[02:17:06.311 --> 02:17:21.020]  I'm not making it up that 50% of the kids that get college degrees that get jobs are making jobs that are paying wages that you can get with a high school diploma and that you can't live on.
[02:17:21.020 --> 02:17:22.401]  I'm not making it up!
[02:17:23.021 --> 02:17:28.346]  So when you look at what they've done, hey, you know when I was a kid that was a strange thing.
[02:17:28.346 --> 02:17:33.871]  They used to have pharmacies on the corner that were owned by people in the community.
[02:17:33.871 --> 02:17:36.693]  There were no Rite-Aids or Walgreens.
[02:17:36.693 --> 02:17:42.839]  There were no Dwayne Reeds or CVS's clogging up every corner.
[02:17:43.539 --> 02:17:52.410]  Everybody had a shot at it until the politicians got paid off to deregulate.
[02:17:52.410 --> 02:17:54.953]  They deregulated the Robinson-Patman Act.
[02:17:54.953 --> 02:17:58.498]  They deregulated the Sherman Antitrust Act.
[02:17:58.498 --> 02:18:01.802]  They deregulated the Clayton Antitrust Act.
[02:18:02.501 --> 02:18:04.163]  And what did they do?
[02:18:04.163 --> 02:18:06.186]  Oh, under Bill Clinton again?
[02:18:06.186 --> 02:18:09.009]  Yeah, you know, the one that everybody loves.
[02:18:09.009 --> 02:18:19.262]  Oh, just a little side note, I heard Obama during the campaign, he kept saying, you know, under Bill Clinton we created 23 million jobs, his government did.
[02:18:20.043 --> 02:18:21.204]  B.S.
[02:18:21.204 --> 02:18:36.751]  The reason we had 23 million jobs back then, for anybody that's old enough to remember, you mentioned 1994, that was the beginning of the internet revolution, the dot-com bubble, it was the whole new world was being born.
[02:18:36.751 --> 02:18:38.532]  But I digress.
[02:18:38.532 --> 02:18:44.996]  Bill Clinton is the guy that under the other member of the Goldman Sachs gang,
[02:18:46.485 --> 02:19:07.543]  Robby Rubin began the process of deregulating the economy on the financial end by killing the Glass-Steagall Act that was put in place during the Great Depression so that the banks couldn't rob all our money by making up all of these games to steal it from us from everywhere we could look at.
[02:19:07.543 --> 02:19:11.886]  So those are two ways to solve the fiscal problem.
[02:19:11.886 --> 02:19:12.407]  The third
[02:19:13.496 --> 02:19:14.977]  Very simple.
[02:19:14.977 --> 02:19:16.819]  And this is one of the big trends.
[02:19:16.819 --> 02:19:19.862]  It's going to be the major trend of 2013.
[02:19:19.862 --> 02:19:25.308]  They're taking us to war.
[02:19:25.308 --> 02:19:27.610]  Eisenhower said it.
[02:19:27.610 --> 02:19:29.952]  I keep saying it over again.
[02:19:29.952 --> 02:19:31.874]  Five-star general.
[02:19:31.874 --> 02:19:35.077]  Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces during World War II.
[02:19:36.764 --> 02:19:38.505]  He warned us.
[02:19:38.505 --> 02:19:41.907]  Oh, two-term Republican president, I forgot.
[02:19:41.907 --> 02:19:46.610]  He warned us that the mil- Oh, and no major wars were fought when he was president?
[02:19:46.610 --> 02:19:47.750]  You know why?
[02:19:47.750 --> 02:19:49.571]  Because he was a man!
[02:19:49.571 --> 02:19:52.173]  He was a man that saw death and destruction.
[02:19:52.173 --> 02:19:56.115]  He was a man that fought, not like these little boys with cajoles.
[02:19:56.115 --> 02:19:57.276]  Stay there, let's come back.
[02:19:57.276 --> 02:19:59.677]  The carrier and the invasion force is getting ready.
[02:19:59.677 --> 02:20:01.298]  They're off the coast of Syria.
[02:20:02.441 --> 02:20:04.462]  This man wants your guns.
[02:20:04.462 --> 02:20:09.904]  That is the cover of the 60-page, glossy magazine, jam-packed with information.
[02:20:09.904 --> 02:20:13.025]  The December issue of InfoWars Magazine.

[02:21:02.429 --> 02:21:07.193]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:21:07.193 --> 02:21:10.235]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:21:10.235 --> 02:21:19.202]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:21:19.202 --> 02:21:24.126]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:21:24.742 --> 02:21:36.114]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[02:21:36.114 --> 02:21:43.121]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[02:21:43.801 --> 02:21:48.105]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[02:21:48.105 --> 02:21:51.689]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[02:21:51.689 --> 02:21:58.956]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[02:21:58.956 --> 02:22:00.237]  Protect your immune system.
[02:22:00.237 --> 02:22:01.278]  It's the only one you've got.
[02:22:02.421 --> 02:22:03.422]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:22:03.422 --> 02:22:08.966]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:22:08.966 --> 02:22:09.507]  I get it.
[02:22:09.507 --> 02:22:19.095]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:22:19.095 --> 02:22:20.496]  That's not what's happening.
[02:22:20.496 --> 02:22:28.963]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:22:28.963 --> 02:22:30.184]  If all looks rosy to you,
[02:22:30.404 --> 02:22:32.304]  Then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:22:32.304 --> 02:22:36.565]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:22:36.565 --> 02:22:38.166]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:22:38.166 --> 02:22:41.547]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[02:22:41.547 --> 02:22:45.868]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:22:45.868 --> 02:22:46.768]  You should too.
[02:22:46.768 --> 02:22:47.888]  Find out what they know.
[02:22:47.888 --> 02:22:50.789]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[02:22:50.789 --> 02:22:50.849]  800-686-2237.
[02:22:50.849 --> 02:22:50.909]  800-686-2237.
[02:22:50.909 --> 02:22:51.269]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:01.240 --> 02:23:02.241]  Hi there.
[02:23:02.241 --> 02:23:03.742]  My name is Frank Bates.
[02:23:03.742 --> 02:23:07.564]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[02:23:07.564 --> 02:23:16.651]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[02:23:16.651 --> 02:23:23.296]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[02:23:23.296 --> 02:23:25.477]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[02:23:25.477 --> 02:23:30.501]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[02:23:31.261 --> 02:23:39.143]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[02:23:39.143 --> 02:23:44.664]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patrons have already seen in the last three months.
[02:23:44.664 --> 02:23:51.146]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[02:23:51.146 --> 02:23:56.907]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:23:56.907 --> 02:23:58.068]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[02:24:06.182 --> 02:24:12.505]  I've got to ask Gerald Salente this question.
[02:24:12.505 --> 02:24:14.466]  If you just tuned in, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:14.466 --> 02:24:16.126]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:24:16.126 --> 02:24:17.927]  Our news sites are InfoWars.com.
[02:24:17.927 --> 02:24:21.929]  We stream video at PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWarsNews.com.
[02:24:21.929 --> 02:24:25.450]  TrendsResearch.com is Gerald's excellent site.
[02:24:25.450 --> 02:24:30.272]  If you want to be successful and know what's coming before it gets there, turn a little bit of football off.
[02:24:31.300 --> 02:24:35.323]  A little bit of the sitcom off, and go check out the powerful information.
[02:24:35.323 --> 02:24:37.225]  It's actually fun to be informed.
[02:24:37.225 --> 02:24:41.348]  People have been taught that it's fun to be stupid, and actually it's not.
[02:24:41.348 --> 02:24:46.452]  Being stupid means you're going to be poor, and your family's not going to be in a bad position.
[02:24:46.452 --> 02:24:48.314]  I just can't imagine.
[02:24:48.314 --> 02:24:53.898]  Manliness is being informed, being involved, and being in charge of your own destiny as much as you can.
[02:24:53.898 --> 02:24:55.400]  Same thing for women.
[02:24:55.400 --> 02:24:57.661]  But side issue, going back to Gerald.
[02:24:58.946 --> 02:25:04.108]  Gerald, it is now in articles in McClatchy News, L.A.
[02:25:04.108 --> 02:25:06.488]  Times, you name it, Drudge Report.
[02:25:06.488 --> 02:25:14.251]  Matt Drudge tweeted out, oh look, now you're going to go and have WMD hysteria and lies before the U.N.
[02:25:14.251 --> 02:25:17.772]  saying Syria is going to use their chemical weapons, which they admit they have.
[02:25:17.772 --> 02:25:19.252]  They haven't attacked anybody.
[02:25:19.252 --> 02:25:24.274]  The West for 21 months is using Al-Qaeda against them, and now the news admits
[02:25:25.114 --> 02:25:32.601]  What we've known for a while, our government is putting Al-Qaeda in with NATO, the French are massing ships, the British are, there's a U.S.
[02:25:32.601 --> 02:25:38.427]  aircraft carrier and three amphibious landing ships, which they don't, I mean, this is insane.
[02:25:38.427 --> 02:25:49.137]  And they're now saying, we need action, because Assad is hurting people, while our government is on record, Al-Qaeda is being put in, where they tell fathers, we're going to kill you if you don't go suicide bomb.
[02:25:49.701 --> 02:25:55.444]  And the news, remember the New York Times a few months ago ran with some stories about that and then pulled it.
[02:25:55.444 --> 02:26:00.887]  Pulled their own video because they thought, oh look, they're making people suicide bomb.
[02:26:00.887 --> 02:26:02.287]  They're the good rebels.
[02:26:02.287 --> 02:26:05.089]  Thinking we would go, oh yeah, that's very moral.
[02:26:05.089 --> 02:26:07.670]  Kind of like when Rumsfeld was going, yeah, we're torturing people.
[02:26:07.670 --> 02:26:09.571]  And people were like, really, that's illegal.
[02:26:09.571 --> 02:26:11.072]  Oh, actually, I didn't mean that.
[02:26:11.072 --> 02:26:13.253]  I mean, it's bizarro.
[02:26:13.253 --> 02:26:16.214]  Even the Nazis didn't admit they were torturing people.
[02:26:18.621 --> 02:26:22.062]  Are we not reaching some type of insanity of the ruling class themselves?
[02:26:22.062 --> 02:26:23.682]  I mean, what's going on here, Gerald?
[02:26:23.682 --> 02:26:24.742]  I think you just said it.
[02:26:24.742 --> 02:26:26.742]  It's insanity.
[02:26:26.742 --> 02:26:42.265]  And it's insanity to believe for one second that the so-called ruling class, the officials, the administrators, the presidents, the prime ministers, their cabinets and war ministers know what they're doing.
[02:26:42.265 --> 02:26:44.806]  They failed in Afghanistan.
[02:26:44.806 --> 02:26:45.766]  They failed in Iraq.
[02:26:47.079 --> 02:26:52.020]  Look at that wonderful humanitarian mission that they pulled off in Libya.
[02:26:52.020 --> 02:26:53.641]  Oh, that was a beaut.
[02:26:53.641 --> 02:26:57.562]  Isn't the freedom and democracy ringing so beautifully?
[02:26:57.562 --> 02:27:01.943]  And now, as you mentioned, they're gearing up to go into Syria.
[02:27:01.943 --> 02:27:04.464]  And that's where I was going with Eisenhower.
[02:27:05.211 --> 02:27:16.338]  Warning that the military-industrial complex was taking over the nation and that if you want to avoid going over this fiscal cliff, try this one on for size.
[02:27:16.338 --> 02:27:19.160]  Didn't the Senate just vote a couple of days ago?
[02:27:19.160 --> 02:27:19.240]  98 to 0?
[02:27:22.722 --> 02:27:28.467]  For a $631 billion defense budget?
[02:27:28.467 --> 02:27:29.928]  98 to 0?
[02:27:29.928 --> 02:27:31.530]  Hey, we got wars to fight!
[02:27:31.530 --> 02:27:35.793]  And by the way, I believe there's going to be supplemental as well.
[02:27:35.793 --> 02:27:38.035]  It's almost $2 trillion, all the different spending.
[02:27:38.035 --> 02:27:39.076]  This is insane!
[02:27:39.076 --> 02:27:42.039]  You cut that by a third, problem solved!
[02:27:42.039 --> 02:27:43.320]  I mean, they've got to do it!
[02:27:43.980 --> 02:27:45.400]  Exactly!
[02:27:45.400 --> 02:27:46.561]  But what are they doing?
[02:27:46.561 --> 02:27:53.623]  Well, they're blowing each other up over there in Detroit with AK-47s, you know, robbing gas stations.
[02:27:53.623 --> 02:27:58.124]  The country's, you know, every day you pick up the paper and you see all this crime.
[02:27:58.124 --> 02:28:01.905]  And by the way, what's going on in Europe that's not making the news here?
[02:28:02.645 --> 02:28:13.127]  My God, the crime rate in Spain, in Greece, the poverty that the people are living in, how this thing is collapsing in front of us.
[02:28:13.127 --> 02:28:14.688]  I got an idea.
[02:28:14.688 --> 02:28:16.708]  Let's start another war.
[02:28:16.708 --> 02:28:20.669]  So, as you were saying, yes, it is insanity.
[02:28:20.669 --> 02:28:26.090]  How can you expect, again, the same people that caused the problems to fix them?
[02:28:26.090 --> 02:28:30.611]  They failed in all these other wars, and now they're going to start another failure.
[02:28:30.931 --> 02:28:33.552]  And I want to pick up on what you said.
[02:28:33.552 --> 02:28:37.835]  The story back in Iraq was, hey, remember that Saddam Hussein?
[02:28:37.835 --> 02:28:40.696]  Yeah, that guy had weapons of mass destruction.
[02:28:40.696 --> 02:28:45.819]  I saw that little coward, that Colin Powell.
[02:28:45.819 --> 02:28:49.561]  Yeah, Colin, you got the right place, man.
[02:28:49.561 --> 02:28:58.565]  Right in that colon, putting on that cheap show in the UN to tell us, hey, look at those pitches.
[02:28:58.565 --> 02:28:59.626]  I'll tell you what that is.
[02:29:00.006 --> 02:29:03.687]  Those are mobile chemical laboratories!
[02:29:03.687 --> 02:29:09.889]  Oh yeah, you remember how they sold us the lie that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction?
[02:29:09.889 --> 02:29:12.790]  It's playing a parallel right now.
[02:29:12.790 --> 02:29:14.351]  It's only different.
[02:29:14.351 --> 02:29:17.652]  Now they're saying Syria is going to use
[02:29:18.132 --> 02:29:19.773]  They're chemical weapons.
[02:29:19.773 --> 02:29:31.863]  Before they said, even though Hussein and all his other people, and even some weapons inspectors said, hey listen man, there are no chemical, there are no weapons of mass destruction, the big lie from the U.S.
[02:29:31.863 --> 02:29:36.067]  was, he has to prove that he doesn't have them.
[02:29:39.505 --> 02:29:41.567]  That was a short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:29:41.567 --> 02:29:42.889]  Gerald Cilente is our guest.
[02:29:42.889 --> 02:29:46.172]  If you want to talk to him on air, 800-259-9231.
[02:29:46.172 --> 02:29:49.335]  We'll continue to talk about where this war will lead us.

[02:29:49.996 --> 02:29:50.997]  Stay with us.
[02:29:50.997 --> 02:29:52.378]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.378 --> 02:29:54.921]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.921 --> 02:29:57.584]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:31:02.626 --> 02:31:08.209]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[02:31:08.209 --> 02:31:11.471]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[02:31:11.471 --> 02:31:14.272]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[02:31:14.272 --> 02:31:17.273]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[02:31:17.273 --> 02:31:20.295]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[02:31:20.795 --> 02:31:25.996]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[02:31:25.996 --> 02:31:28.677]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.

[02:33:21.786 --> 02:33:24.788]  Waging war on corruption.

[02:33:28.290 --> 02:33:33.874]  Back weeknight 7 o'clock with Infowars Nightly News at infowarsnews.com.

[02:33:56.503 --> 02:34:01.766]  Alright, Gerald Cilente is our guest, and we are going right back to him to race through.
[02:34:01.766 --> 02:34:05.207]  There's a couple more pages of great points he wants to make.
[02:34:05.207 --> 02:34:12.611]  Let's continue to go through your trends, because the war that you've been saying for several years will come, it's definitely going on.
[02:34:12.611 --> 02:34:19.634]  Proxy wars, big wars, they just call them peace because Obama is a peace prize winner, it's all part of the sick joke.
[02:34:19.634 --> 02:34:22.856]  The torture continues, they documented that in Benghazi.
[02:34:24.312 --> 02:34:25.873]  There's evidence it was election fraud.
[02:34:25.873 --> 02:34:28.254]  I'm not saying it doesn't, you know, that Romney would have saved us.
[02:34:28.254 --> 02:34:31.655]  It was just the fix was in at every level.
[02:34:31.655 --> 02:34:34.557]  This is not a mandate for everything Obama's doing.
[02:34:34.557 --> 02:34:53.586]  Nothing but lobbyists, nothing but signing statements, giant scams, waivers to his buddies from all his laws, saying he'll take guns without congressional approval, shutting down power plants without congressional approval, signing a cybersecurity act and not letting Congress see it, but then the UN brags it gives them the internet.
[02:34:53.586 --> 02:34:53.826]  I mean,
[02:34:54.306 --> 02:35:09.418]  Things are exponentially moving quicker to the point of, I don't, I think I've gotten punch-drunk and almost, you know, I am in a learned helplessness state because, and I'm informed, and it's just getting crazier by the minute.
[02:35:09.418 --> 02:35:11.800]  How crazy will it be in another year?
[02:35:11.800 --> 02:35:18.064]  In three years, if we continue down this road, and the bankers are so arrogant, they're all over the news going, we conquered America!
[02:35:19.385 --> 02:35:22.146]  I listen to Bloomberg on XM all the time, driving home at night.
[02:35:22.146 --> 02:35:26.028]  And they'll be going, don't worry, we'll get a third bailout for ourselves out of Europe.
[02:35:26.028 --> 02:35:27.549]  We're taking over America.
[02:35:27.549 --> 02:35:28.049]  There's no way.
[02:35:28.049 --> 02:35:30.230]  We've got all the pension funds tied up in what we're doing.
[02:35:30.230 --> 02:35:32.671]  We're telling all the other Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan people.
[02:35:32.671 --> 02:35:36.873]  We have all these head guys on, bragging how they've got us by the short hairs.
[02:35:36.873 --> 02:35:39.594]  Just bragging how they're setting up a corporate world government.
[02:35:39.594 --> 02:35:41.655]  CNBC, AP, Reuters.
[02:35:41.655 --> 02:35:42.195]  You read.
[02:35:42.195 --> 02:35:44.796]  I mean, my crew's been up there three, four times to meet with you.
[02:35:44.796 --> 02:35:45.637]  I've met you in New York.
[02:35:46.797 --> 02:35:48.018]  Why are they bragging?
[02:35:48.018 --> 02:35:50.220]  I mean, I know you worked around the White Shoe Boys.
[02:35:50.220 --> 02:35:54.724]  I mean, I guess they are the classic criminals because they brag about it on top of it.
[02:35:54.724 --> 02:35:55.624]  Gerald, I'm ranting.
[02:35:55.624 --> 02:35:56.525]  Go ahead.
[02:35:56.525 --> 02:35:59.928]  Well, they're sociopaths, and that's the way they behave.
[02:35:59.928 --> 02:36:06.613]  And they're money junkies, just like any other junkie, whether you're on heroin or cocaine, whatever it might be.
[02:36:06.613 --> 02:36:07.213]  You don't care.
[02:36:07.213 --> 02:36:08.394]  You just want to get your fix.
[02:36:09.275 --> 02:36:12.218]  And then you know the kind of head that a junkie has.
[02:36:12.218 --> 02:36:13.699]  That's all they are.
[02:36:13.699 --> 02:36:15.661]  They're no more than that, no less than that.
[02:36:15.661 --> 02:36:21.607]  And I just want to stay on Syria for one moment, because they're doing an Iraq with Syria.
[02:36:21.607 --> 02:36:24.349]  They're asking them to prove the unprovable.
[02:36:24.349 --> 02:36:33.998]  And the unprovable with Syria is, are they going to use these chemical weapons against their people or against other countries?
[02:36:34.719 --> 02:36:39.362]  And they're using that as an excuse for a preemptive attack, just like they did with Iraq.
[02:36:39.362 --> 02:36:43.704]  That's like saying, Russia, we've got to attack you because you might attack us someday.
[02:36:43.704 --> 02:36:45.225]  That's what Hitler did.
[02:36:45.225 --> 02:36:45.645]  Exactly.
[02:36:45.645 --> 02:36:49.528]  Well, that's what Bush did with Iraq.
[02:36:49.528 --> 02:36:56.151]  They attacked a country that said that they didn't have what America and England and the Coalition of the Willing said they had.
[02:36:56.151 --> 02:36:57.172]  They said, we don't have them.
[02:36:57.432 --> 02:36:59.853]  The weapons inspector said we can't find them.
[02:36:59.853 --> 02:37:02.395]  Oh, you can't find them because he won't give them to you.
[02:37:02.395 --> 02:37:03.595]  So it's this lunacy.
[02:37:03.595 --> 02:37:05.156]  It began what you said.
[02:37:05.156 --> 02:37:06.597]  Are they insane?
[02:37:06.597 --> 02:37:07.617]  Yes.
[02:37:07.617 --> 02:37:17.282]  And what I'm talking about and I've been saying and I'm most concerned about is the first great war of the 21st century.
[02:37:17.282 --> 02:37:22.925]  But before I go into that, I also want to pick up on what you said about Obama getting reelected.
[02:37:23.425 --> 02:37:25.626]  I've been around this thing a long time.
[02:37:25.626 --> 02:37:31.407]  I've never seen an election that ended with such a thud like this one.
[02:37:31.407 --> 02:37:34.868]  The bloom was off the rose immediately.
[02:37:34.868 --> 02:37:38.409]  There was no post-election high.
[02:37:38.409 --> 02:37:42.770]  The Dow dove about 300 points.
[02:37:42.770 --> 02:37:46.291]  Gold prices shot up 50 points.
[02:37:46.291 --> 02:37:50.332]  Since that time, the world equity markets have been on a downdraft.
[02:37:51.118 --> 02:37:53.923]  Then it was the clips with General Petraeus.
[02:37:53.923 --> 02:37:55.325]  You remember him?
[02:37:55.325 --> 02:38:01.054]  That guy with the Boy Scouts charm, as the toilet paper record refers to him as.
[02:38:01.983 --> 02:38:16.373]  We have never seen a post-election dive emotionally, spiritually, financially, like we're witnessing now, and then go back into the war.
[02:38:16.373 --> 02:38:21.436]  By the way, they can't even, just real quick, just to back you up, they can't even sell inaugural tickets, none of them.
[02:38:21.436 --> 02:38:22.857]  They can't sell hotel rooms.
[02:38:22.857 --> 02:38:29.682]  He's so unpopular, but the system knows, again, they rigged it with Romney too, he didn't even get elected!
[02:38:30.422 --> 02:38:34.307]  I mean, I've talked to Bev Harris, all the experts.
[02:38:34.307 --> 02:38:38.232]  Do you really believe, Gerald, that California didn't vote to not label GMO?
[02:38:38.232 --> 02:38:39.033]  I mean, give me a break.
[02:38:39.033 --> 02:38:42.197]  When polls were showing it for a while, 2-1 for it.
[02:38:42.197 --> 02:38:47.143]  I mean, we're now entering just... They are absolutely engaging in a total takeover.
[02:38:47.143 --> 02:38:47.464]  I'm sorry.
[02:38:48.021 --> 02:38:48.941]  No, I agree with you.
[02:38:48.941 --> 02:38:50.982]  I don't believe the California vote at all.
[02:38:50.982 --> 02:38:52.062]  Not at all.
[02:38:52.062 --> 02:38:53.182]  You know, I mean, come on.
[02:38:53.182 --> 02:38:59.224]  You're going to save a couple of pennies by, you know, putting... I mean, who would believe the big companies anyway?
[02:38:59.224 --> 02:39:00.584]  So, no, I agree.
[02:39:00.584 --> 02:39:03.385]  You know, I don't... Nothing they do, I trust.
[02:39:03.385 --> 02:39:07.426]  But going back to the Great War, how much more... I'm telling you...
[02:39:08.246 --> 02:39:12.129]  Alex, we're watching very closely what's going on in Europe.
[02:39:12.129 --> 02:39:13.450]  What's going on in Italy.
[02:39:13.450 --> 02:39:16.111]  What's going on in Spain.
[02:39:16.111 --> 02:39:17.933]  What's going on in Greece.
[02:39:17.933 --> 02:39:20.034]  What's going on in Hungary.
[02:39:20.034 --> 02:39:21.515]  What's going on in Slovenia.
[02:39:21.515 --> 02:39:22.996]  The hospitals are shutting down.
[02:39:22.996 --> 02:39:23.776]  They're burning.
[02:39:23.776 --> 02:39:25.458]  Robberies everywhere.
[02:39:25.458 --> 02:39:28.300]  Basic hygiene at risk in debt-stricken Greek hospitals.
[02:39:28.300 --> 02:39:30.121]  People are dumping their kids on the street.
[02:39:30.121 --> 02:39:36.785]  It is bedlam and the bankers are raising taxes knowing it will put the countries into cardiac arrest so they can buy everything up.
[02:39:36.785 --> 02:39:37.546]  It's insane!
[02:39:38.306 --> 02:39:41.327]  It's insane and it's war.
[02:39:41.327 --> 02:39:44.288]  And no one will call a spade a spade.
[02:39:44.288 --> 02:39:45.889]  Economic war.
[02:39:45.889 --> 02:39:48.350]  Of course, it's class warfare.
[02:39:48.350 --> 02:39:52.011]  What different... What do you think the Arab Springs were?
[02:39:52.011 --> 02:39:54.272]  We wrote about them before they happened.
[02:39:54.272 --> 02:39:56.873]  It wasn't a pro-democracy movement.
[02:39:57.293 --> 02:40:06.738]  It was a lot of people that are tired of not having any money while the top of the pyramid is raping everybody else and stealing all the dough.
[02:40:06.738 --> 02:40:10.361]  Same in Tunisia, the same everywhere.
[02:40:10.361 --> 02:40:12.802]  So now we have a war in Libya.
[02:40:12.802 --> 02:40:14.663]  We have a war in Syria.
[02:40:14.663 --> 02:40:18.225]  We have a war in Bahrain that doesn't make the news.
[02:40:18.225 --> 02:40:20.346]  There's a war in Yemen.
[02:40:20.346 --> 02:40:23.528]  There's wars now heating up in Jordan.
[02:40:23.528 --> 02:40:24.649]  They're starting to oppose
[02:40:25.882 --> 02:40:27.142]  The King!
[02:40:27.142 --> 02:40:28.043]  The King!
[02:40:28.043 --> 02:40:28.783]  I love it!
[02:40:28.783 --> 02:40:30.924]  You can't call kings dictators!
[02:40:30.924 --> 02:40:31.804]  No, no, man!
[02:40:31.804 --> 02:40:34.605]  And don't say anything bad about them enemies!
[02:40:34.605 --> 02:40:36.925]  No, they're not dictators either!
[02:40:36.925 --> 02:40:40.987]  So you have all of these dictators that are starting to collapse.
[02:40:40.987 --> 02:40:44.708]  You have, as I said, there's class warfare throughout Europe.
[02:40:45.428 --> 02:40:46.609]  It's going on.
[02:40:46.609 --> 02:40:49.371]  The people are taking to the streets continually.
[02:40:49.371 --> 02:40:54.114]  The first great war of the 21st century has begun.
[02:40:54.114 --> 02:41:03.299]  And now, when they go into Syria, watch out for an explosion that you're going to start seeing rattle the world.
[02:41:03.299 --> 02:41:06.441]  You know, Alex, I have to tell you a quick story.
[02:41:06.441 --> 02:41:12.085]  And I'm going to ask my assistant over here to get me that little frame from General Anthony Zinnig.
[02:41:13.249 --> 02:41:23.031]  I was asked in 2000 to be the keynote speaker at Virginia Military Institute, VMI.
[02:41:23.031 --> 02:41:33.012]  You remember, that's the place where Romney went when he announced what his geopolitical and foreign policy strategy would be.
[02:41:33.012 --> 02:41:33.933]  Yes.
[02:41:33.933 --> 02:41:42.174]  I was called down there to be the keynote speaker to talk about what new millennium warfare would look like.
[02:41:42.634 --> 02:41:43.475]  This is now 2000.
[02:41:43.475 --> 02:41:48.883]  I had written Trends 2000, my national bestseller, a Warner book.
[02:41:49.983 --> 02:41:59.385]  Now here I am, now the panel, after I speak, included such people as General Anthony Zinni.
[02:41:59.385 --> 02:42:05.167]  This is the guy that ran the first Iraq war, what was that, the first Gulf War.
[02:42:05.167 --> 02:42:08.928]  He was in charge of the troops under Schwarzenegger.
[02:42:08.928 --> 02:42:10.688]  He's on the panel.
[02:42:10.688 --> 02:42:13.729]  I'm discussing what new Millennium Warfare will look like.
[02:42:14.525 --> 02:42:17.006]  Here's the little note he sent me afterwards.
[02:42:17.006 --> 02:42:20.368]  Gerald, thank you for the book and kind note.
[02:42:20.368 --> 02:42:24.430]  My mission to the Middle East will continue, but will be difficult.
[02:42:24.430 --> 02:42:26.011]  Have a great holiday season.
[02:42:26.011 --> 02:42:27.091]  All the best.
[02:42:27.091 --> 02:42:28.872]  Tony Zinni.
[02:42:28.872 --> 02:42:33.355]  So, here I am telling them what New Millennium Warfare will look like.
[02:42:33.355 --> 02:42:34.375]  Show us that book again.
[02:42:34.375 --> 02:42:34.996]  Show us the book again.
[02:42:34.996 --> 02:42:36.296]  I had something up on screen.
[02:42:36.296 --> 02:42:39.398]  I don't have... No, that was his... Let me get the book.
[02:42:39.398 --> 02:42:43.180]  This is his... This is his note to me.
[02:42:44.491 --> 02:42:47.673]  And my book was Trends 2000.
[02:42:47.673 --> 02:42:49.975]  It was a national bestseller.
[02:42:49.975 --> 02:42:51.056]  Huge book.
[02:42:51.056 --> 02:42:54.118]  It's in 16 different languages.
[02:42:54.118 --> 02:42:57.440]  So now they bring me in to talk about new millennium warfare.
[02:42:57.440 --> 02:43:04.545]  Remember, the generals are bringing me in at VMI to tell them what new millennium warfare will look like.
[02:43:04.545 --> 02:43:06.926]  Because you've all heard the line.
[02:43:06.926 --> 02:43:10.029]  The generals are always fighting the last war.
[02:43:10.749 --> 02:43:17.914]  So when I talk about the great war of the 21st century, here's what it's going to look like.
[02:43:17.914 --> 02:43:22.797]  It's going to look like dirty bombs going off in Manhattan.
[02:43:22.797 --> 02:43:27.340]  It'll be suitcase-sized nukes going off in Atlanta.
[02:43:27.340 --> 02:43:28.741]  And Obama just said that on Monday.
[02:43:28.741 --> 02:43:29.742]  He says there's missing nukes.
[02:43:30.546 --> 02:43:31.947]  Missing nukes!
[02:43:31.947 --> 02:43:49.163]  I got the whole front of this book of all of the missing weapons of mass destruction and suitcase-sized nukes that was being sold on the black market when the Soviet Union dissolved.
[02:43:49.163 --> 02:43:52.547]  Alexander Lebed exposed all that, and they blew up his helicopter.
[02:43:53.459 --> 02:43:55.620]  You know, 20 years late!
[02:43:55.620 --> 02:43:59.540]  So anyway, you're going to see biological warfare.
[02:43:59.540 --> 02:44:01.741]  You're going to see hell.
[02:44:01.741 --> 02:44:19.965]  And what they're going to do, as the more of this that happens, the more rights they're going to take away from us under the guise that the psychopaths and sociopaths that started this are now going to save us!
[02:44:19.965 --> 02:44:21.586]  Alex, the first
[02:44:22.546 --> 02:44:32.296]  Major trend of the New Trends Journal coming out, the top trends for 2013, is going to be peace.
[02:44:32.296 --> 02:44:40.945]  And I mean that, and we're doing everything, and we think, and I'll be discussing it more, that we have a real peace plan.
[02:44:40.945 --> 02:44:42.787]  And something to put into place.
[02:44:42.787 --> 02:44:44.789]  Because you don't have to listen to me.
[02:44:45.569 --> 02:44:48.952]  Look with your eyes, listen with your ears.
[02:44:48.952 --> 02:44:50.514]  Open your mind up.
[02:44:50.514 --> 02:44:52.776]  Look what's going on around the world.
[02:44:52.776 --> 02:44:54.957]  Look what's going on in this country.
[02:44:54.957 --> 02:44:57.640]  You can see it collapsing in front of us.
[02:44:57.640 --> 02:44:59.301]  The fiscal cliff?
[02:44:59.301 --> 02:45:01.904]  How about the bottomless pit?
[02:45:03.991 --> 02:45:04.531]  Well said.
[02:45:04.531 --> 02:45:06.872]  I want to take a few phone calls as we promised him.
[02:45:06.872 --> 02:45:09.273]  We've got you until five after next hour.
[02:45:09.273 --> 02:45:13.495]  So just about 15, 20 more minutes left total here with Gerald Cilenta.
[02:45:13.495 --> 02:45:15.836]  And there's a few other important points he needs to get into.
[02:45:15.836 --> 02:45:20.759]  But the establishment is digging in for a World War III type scenario.
[02:45:20.759 --> 02:45:28.102]  That's exactly all the intel I get, the stuff, the information I respect in the film we made with Joel Scowls in Strategic Relocation.
[02:45:30.831 --> 02:45:39.655]  Max Keiser calls them suicide bankers, where there were people in the towers who were there during the crisis making money even after one tower had collapsed.
[02:45:39.655 --> 02:45:47.679]  There were people staying in one because they were making millions and killing themselves to make extra money.
[02:45:47.679 --> 02:45:50.360]  And you know, these guys have so many billions of dollars apiece.
[02:45:52.665 --> 02:46:16.821]  It's all about, because I've read about the way they behave, showing off to the other ones, and that guy's got 20 billion, I've only got 5 billion, and they're selling all this fraud, and then the police, the military, they're all trained just to follow it, and it is a kind of a Caligula-type deal where he marries his horse, and then, you know, makes it the regent of Rome.
[02:46:16.821 --> 02:46:18.202]  How do we stop these people?
[02:46:20.470 --> 02:46:29.815]  Again, I'm going to be talking about this in more detail as we put the whole package together, but I want to also pick up what you were saying about the bankers.
[02:46:29.815 --> 02:46:32.456]  Again, I'm not making this stuff up.
[02:46:32.456 --> 02:46:45.623]  As I mentioned, Robert Rubin was the former CEO of Goldman Sachs gang, and he was appointed as Treasury Secretary under Clinton as they deregulated the Glass-Steagall Act.
[02:46:45.623 --> 02:46:49.785]  One of the big corporations that were created from that was Citigroup.
[02:46:50.819 --> 02:46:52.720]  He then ends up getting a job.
[02:46:52.720 --> 02:47:00.565]  Citigroup merges with Smith Barney, Traveller's Insurance Company, Citibank puts it all together.
[02:47:00.565 --> 02:47:02.806]  Then he becomes a consultant for them.
[02:47:02.806 --> 02:47:03.887]  What does he make?
[02:47:03.887 --> 02:47:04.327]  Over $100 million.
[02:47:06.388 --> 02:47:18.072]  Who was the Treasury Secretary under Bush that gave us TARP and made up the great big lie of too big to fail?
[02:47:18.072 --> 02:47:23.815]  Too big to fail are the words too big to fail that destroyed capitalism.
[02:47:23.815 --> 02:47:25.435]  This isn't capitalism.
[02:47:25.435 --> 02:47:27.936]  In capitalism, nobody's too big to fail.
[02:47:27.936 --> 02:47:31.638]  It's fascism, the merger of state and corporate powers.
[02:47:31.638 --> 02:47:33.318]  Henry Paulson.
[02:47:33.318 --> 02:47:34.699]  Where did Paulson come from?
[02:47:35.399 --> 02:47:40.944]  He was the CEO of the Goldman Sachs gang before becoming Treasury Secretary.
[02:47:40.944 --> 02:47:42.205]  Okay, you got it.
[02:47:42.205 --> 02:47:43.446]  Two in a row.
[02:47:43.446 --> 02:47:49.492]  Then, who's the guy that brought down MF Global and that robbed me and others of their money?
[02:47:49.492 --> 02:47:51.353]  Can't find $1.6 billion.
[02:47:51.353 --> 02:47:58.500]  Oh, that wasn't John the Slime Cozine, former Governor and Senator of New Jersey.
[02:47:58.500 --> 02:47:59.401]  Oh, and before that?
[02:47:59.921 --> 02:48:02.702]  The head of the Goldman Sachs gang, that's right.
[02:48:02.702 --> 02:48:06.143]  And who's the head of the Commodities Future Trading Commission?
[02:48:06.143 --> 02:48:07.803]  Oh, Gary Gensler.
[02:48:07.803 --> 02:48:12.225]  And they never prosecuted or brought Corzine up on charges.
[02:48:12.225 --> 02:48:14.105]  Oh, where did he come from?
[02:48:14.105 --> 02:48:18.727]  Oh, he worked for Corzine when Corzine was with Goldman Sachs.
[02:48:19.495 --> 02:48:25.896]  Oh Alex, who's the new guy over there that just became the head of the Bank of England?
[02:48:25.896 --> 02:48:27.657]  You know, the City of London?
[02:48:27.657 --> 02:48:29.157]  The City of London?
[02:48:29.157 --> 02:48:32.838]  Yeah, there's a kid, you know, there's a family show.
[02:48:32.838 --> 02:48:42.440]  I can't say what I really want to say, but let's just say the City of London makes Las Vegas look like, you know, kids play.
[02:48:43.460 --> 02:48:44.802]  City of London.
[02:48:44.802 --> 02:48:48.925]  It's a place where you could do the dirtiest deals at the highest levels.
[02:48:48.925 --> 02:48:52.048]  Who became the head of the Bank of England over there?
[02:48:52.048 --> 02:48:52.729]  Huh.
[02:48:52.729 --> 02:48:54.030]  Mark Carney.
[02:48:54.030 --> 02:48:55.812]  Oh, I love that word, Carney.
[02:48:55.812 --> 02:48:57.774]  Carney Carnivalman.
[02:48:57.774 --> 02:49:00.857]  Oh yeah, this guy's the perfect Carney.
[02:49:00.857 --> 02:49:02.598]  Carney, where did Mark Carney come from?
[02:49:03.559 --> 02:49:07.702]  Wasn't he just running the show over here in Canada?
[02:49:07.702 --> 02:49:08.763]  The bank over there?
[02:49:08.763 --> 02:49:09.423]  Yeah!
[02:49:09.423 --> 02:49:10.985]  And now he's the head of the Bank of England.
[02:49:10.985 --> 02:49:16.989]  And by the way, even the outgoing head of the Bank of England, who's a globalist, says this is the equivalent.
[02:49:16.989 --> 02:49:19.511]  In fact, talk about tooting horns.
[02:49:19.511 --> 02:49:24.534]  Guys, type in Bank of England Head War, and it's a...
[02:49:25.715 --> 02:49:27.157]  It's a London Guardian article.
[02:49:27.157 --> 02:49:29.359]  There's also a Daily Mail one.
[02:49:29.359 --> 02:49:33.624]  And he says this financial meltdown is like a new world war.
[02:49:33.624 --> 02:49:35.466]  I didn't put the connection to you.
[02:49:35.466 --> 02:49:38.129]  I think he's basically saying what you're saying.
[02:49:38.129 --> 02:49:41.353]  And he's saying this new guy that it's like a criminal takeover, basically.
[02:49:41.653 --> 02:49:42.093]  When you-
[02:50:12.153 --> 02:50:15.535]  Multimillionaire, billionaire because of his brains?
[02:50:15.535 --> 02:50:19.296]  You make the money because you're on the inside of the mob.
[02:50:19.296 --> 02:50:23.398]  So now the Goldman Sachs gang now is running the Bank of England.
[02:50:23.398 --> 02:50:25.179]  Oh, oh, and then I forgot.
[02:50:25.179 --> 02:50:27.580]  The European Central Bank.
[02:50:27.580 --> 02:50:29.340]  How could I forget that one?
[02:50:29.340 --> 02:50:30.441]  Who's running that one?
[02:50:31.301 --> 02:50:33.703]  Mario Draghi.
[02:50:33.703 --> 02:50:35.905]  Mario Draghi, hey!
[02:50:35.905 --> 02:50:47.554]  Wasn't he the vice chairman of the Goldman Sachs gang in Europe before becoming appointed to head the European Central Bank?
[02:50:48.408 --> 02:50:54.912]  Wasn't he the guy that they blamed for bringing Greece into the European Union, the Eurozone?
[02:50:54.912 --> 02:50:55.332]  That's right.
[02:50:55.332 --> 02:50:58.914]  It's a total world government, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase takeover.
[02:50:58.914 --> 02:51:00.836]  We'll be right back with Joel Celente and your phone calls.
[02:51:00.836 --> 02:51:01.136]  Stay there.
[02:51:02.219 --> 02:51:04.241]  This man wants your guns.

[02:52:02.310 --> 02:52:10.553]  Hi, my name is Annette and due to menopause symptoms for nearly two years, I suffered severe hot flashes which prevented me from sleeping all night.
[02:52:10.553 --> 02:52:15.035]  It was so hard to work because I continued all day to have the hot flashes from hell.
[02:52:15.035 --> 02:52:17.435]  I was exhausted and depleted.
[02:52:17.435 --> 02:52:22.257]  After only three weeks on One World Way, I have no hot flashes and I'm sleeping normally again.
[02:52:22.257 --> 02:52:24.478]  I feel energized and strong.
[02:52:24.958 --> 02:52:26.419]  This is an amazing product.
[02:52:26.419 --> 02:52:33.064]  It is a little known fact that every single cell of your body is supposed to produce 10% of its protein content as glutathione.
[02:52:33.064 --> 02:52:35.926]  But due to toxicity and aging, it does not.
[02:52:35.926 --> 02:52:40.190]  Could glutathione be a missing factor in optimal cell function for your entire body?
[02:52:40.190 --> 02:52:47.315]  If you restore the optimal glutathione levels in your cells, especially your glands and organs, then as a result, your glands and organs work better.
[02:52:47.315 --> 02:52:49.837]  Imagine the quality of life improvement you might have.

[02:53:05.485 --> 02:53:08.046]  Vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts.

[02:55:22.362 --> 02:55:24.883]  Gerald, let's jam in a couple phone calls here.
[02:55:24.883 --> 02:55:26.004]  Quick questions.
[02:55:26.004 --> 02:55:29.346]  Bert in Illinois.
[02:55:29.346 --> 02:55:32.248]  And what's your quick question for Gerald Salente, sir?
[02:55:32.668 --> 02:55:38.812]  Well, first of all, I want to thank you and Gerald for your dedication to the cause.
[02:55:38.812 --> 02:55:39.412]  Thank you.
[02:55:39.412 --> 02:55:41.194]  Number one, I don't know if you've ever seen the movie.
[02:55:41.194 --> 02:55:42.554]  I didn't hear anything.
[02:55:42.554 --> 02:55:49.999]  Number one, I don't know if you've seen the movie Billy Jekyll's The Washington, a good depiction of the Congress.
[02:55:49.999 --> 02:55:50.920]  Number two, are you there?
[02:55:52.073 --> 02:55:52.914]  Hello?
[02:55:52.914 --> 02:55:54.935]  Yeah, Gerald was having trouble hearing you, sir.
[02:55:54.935 --> 02:55:56.216]  Do you have a quick question?
[02:55:56.216 --> 02:56:04.182]  Yes, I called the NRA yesterday and they didn't seem interested in the Bob Costas thing whatsoever.
[02:56:04.182 --> 02:56:07.505]  I'm wondering if the NRA is in bed with Washington.
[02:56:07.845 --> 02:56:10.789]  Well, that's what Larry Pratt reluctantly has been forced to say.
[02:56:10.789 --> 02:56:14.253]  He likes to be classy, but the NRA has sold us out in the past.
[02:56:14.253 --> 02:56:15.634]  They've got some better board members now.
[02:56:15.634 --> 02:56:21.861]  What do you think of Bob Costas now saying, hey, men 20 to 30 cannot be trusted with guns?
[02:56:21.861 --> 02:56:24.064]  And he's basically doubled down.
[02:56:24.064 --> 02:56:26.406]  We played the clip yesterday and just said, ban them all.
[02:56:26.406 --> 02:56:28.088]  Just men cannot be trusted.
[02:56:29.144 --> 02:56:33.209]  Why would I care less what a sports announcer has to say?
[02:56:33.209 --> 02:56:34.090]  No, no, I agree.
[02:56:34.090 --> 02:56:38.416]  I mean, why are they... I mean, they're obviously using the NFL to go after our guns now.
[02:56:38.416 --> 02:56:39.257]  Yeah, I mean, really.
[02:56:39.257 --> 02:56:40.599]  I mean, what is this guy?
[02:56:40.599 --> 02:56:42.281]  I mean, why should anybody listen to him?
[02:56:42.281 --> 02:56:43.402]  He calls games.
[02:56:44.804 --> 02:56:45.824]  How about Kate Middleton?
[02:56:45.824 --> 02:56:47.325]  I wonder how her pregnancy's going.
[02:56:47.325 --> 02:56:50.286]  No, no, I agree with you, but my point is... But why listen to these people?
[02:56:50.286 --> 02:56:55.508]  No, no, I agree with you, but the point is, you know, he carried the water for Sandusky as well.
[02:56:55.508 --> 02:56:58.769]  You know, my point is, is that these signals are coming after the guns.
[02:56:58.769 --> 02:57:02.731]  What's your take on the word that Obama may use executive orders outside of law?
[02:57:03.348 --> 02:57:04.469]  Oh, definitely.
[02:57:04.469 --> 02:57:09.752]  As I said, as the world war heats up, we get shut down.
[02:57:09.752 --> 02:57:16.856]  Oh, they're going to use every two-bit excuse they can to take all our rights away, as they're already doing.
[02:57:16.856 --> 02:57:20.198]  The worst conditions become the worst it's going to get.
[02:57:20.198 --> 02:57:22.520]  Just to put things into perspective, how bad it's gotten.
[02:57:23.320 --> 02:57:24.381]  Go back 10 years ago.
[02:57:24.381 --> 02:57:26.322]  What was the price of gold in 2000?
[02:57:26.322 --> 02:57:27.303]  $250 an ounce?
[02:57:27.303 --> 02:57:27.663]  Yeah.
[02:57:27.663 --> 02:57:29.384]  Today it's $700.
[02:57:29.384 --> 02:57:30.285]  What was silver?
[02:57:30.285 --> 02:57:31.126]  $4 an ounce?
[02:57:31.126 --> 02:57:32.587]  Today it's $34.
[02:57:32.587 --> 02:57:34.188]  What was a barrel of oil?
[02:57:34.188 --> 02:57:34.388]  $20?
[02:57:34.388 --> 02:57:34.948]  What is it now?
[02:57:34.948 --> 02:57:37.650]  $90 to $120 a barrel?
[02:57:37.650 --> 02:57:38.891]  So look what's going on.
[02:57:38.891 --> 02:57:44.255]  The whole thing... Oh, by the way, over in... You've heard me talk about the whole world's collapsing economically.
[02:57:44.255 --> 02:57:47.357]  They just lowered interest rates again in Australia.
[02:57:47.357 --> 02:57:49.279]  The whole commodity boom is over over there.
[02:57:49.679 --> 02:57:50.940]  They're doing everything they can.
[02:57:50.940 --> 02:57:54.081]  Governments all over the world pumping cheap money into the system.
[02:57:54.081 --> 02:57:55.622]  The thing is under collapse.
[02:57:55.622 --> 02:57:58.023]  I'm saying, look what's going on.
[02:57:58.023 --> 02:58:02.305]  The more it spins out of control, the more rights they're going to take away from us.
[02:58:02.305 --> 02:58:07.808]  And yes, they are going to do their very best to take our rights to bear arms away from us.
[02:58:07.808 --> 02:58:08.348]  I hear you.
[02:58:08.348 --> 02:58:08.908]  I hear you.
[02:58:08.908 --> 02:58:09.369]  Incredible.
[02:58:09.369 --> 02:58:10.389]  I want to get to more calls.
[02:58:10.389 --> 02:58:11.890]  We're running out of time here, but I don't...
[02:58:12.350 --> 02:58:14.210]  I want listeners to understand, we're not hyping this.
[02:58:14.210 --> 02:58:17.611]  You know, the New York Times, four years ago, called you a pessimist porn dealer.
