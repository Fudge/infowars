[00:00:10.743 --> 00:00:13.044]  I'm Jakari Jackson with the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:13.445 --> 00:00:21.189]  Now, it's no secret that America is overweight, but isn't it your right as an American to be as fat as you want to be, or as healthy or skinny or anything else?
[00:00:21.549 --> 00:00:23.030]  Well, the government doesn't think so.
[00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.211]  Let's start with Mayor Bloomberg.
[00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:26.592]  Washington, D.C.
[00:00:26.612 --> 00:00:30.534]  is ready to follow New York's example as they plan to ban large soft drinks.
[00:00:31.914 --> 00:00:41.703]  Not only is this completely ridiculous and very much unconstitutional, it doesn't even take into account for diet soft drinks, which can actually be worse for you because of aspartame.
[00:00:42.344 --> 00:00:49.291]  You cannot go to the grocery store now and buy any type of even regular sugar gum that hasn't had aspartame added to it.
[00:00:49.972 --> 00:00:58.564]  A long-term study found that those who drink just one can of diet soda a day have a 42% increased chance of leukemia, as well as other health factors.
[00:00:58.944 --> 00:01:03.130]  Michelle Obama is also concerned about health, particularly when it comes to the nation's youth.
[00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.576]  The First Lady launched a campaign to count the calories of the nation's school children.
[00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:16.474]  Starting this year, the talented people who cook the food at your school will be offering you all kinds of healthy, delicious new choices.
[00:01:16.894 --> 00:01:19.035]  These healthy foods are good for your body.
[00:01:19.515 --> 00:01:21.836]  They'll give you energy and make you stronger.
[00:01:22.376 --> 00:01:26.058]  The problem with this policy is that it is a one-size-fits-all endeavor.
[00:01:26.418 --> 00:01:35.462]  It doesn't take into account the needs of athletes and other students who are just generally more hungry than their classmates, as demonstrated in this video by a Kansas high school.
[00:01:36.257 --> 00:01:44.829]  Tonight, we are hungry.
[00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:48.174]  Set the policy on fire.
[00:01:48.695 --> 00:01:51.980]  Pick your bird brighter than the sun.
[00:01:56.508 --> 00:02:07.593]  If we can stay in the lunchroom for one moment longer, a school in Chicago has banned home-packed lunches, denying parents and even the students themselves the right to eat whatever they seem fit.
[00:02:08.326 --> 00:02:12.949]  Meanwhile, several Chicago schools have earned a failing grade in the cafeteria.
[00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:20.995]  Since 2011, 244 of Chicago's 681 public schools failed at least one inspection.
[00:02:21.616 --> 00:02:29.962]  At Cameron Elementary, inspectors found a mice dropping infestation in the main kitchen with more than 600 scattered droppings.
[00:02:30.182 --> 00:02:38.329]  Here at Hirsch Metro High School, mice got into some nachos and several students actually got sick eating rodent droppings.
[00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:42.232]  A hot topic today is the labeling of genetically modified foods.
[00:02:42.633 --> 00:02:54.703]  Some groups, like the American Academy of Pediatrics, said they have no reason to believe that organic foods are any better than GMOs, even though the AAP recognizes that organic foods have less pesticides.
[00:02:55.336 --> 00:03:10.176]  No, on 37, a Monsanto-funded group against the labeling of GMOs stated that new labels would cost California consumers up to $400 a year, as if food companies don't regularly change their labels for every major sporting event and blockbuster movie.
[00:03:10.746 --> 00:03:13.548]  Many of these food containers also contain BPA.
[00:03:13.968 --> 00:03:23.454]  Canada became the first country in 2010 to ban the use of BPA in just some products, and Europe soon adopted many of these bans.
[00:03:23.634 --> 00:03:29.358]  However, in the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration has been much more reluctant to admit the dangers.
[00:03:29.898 --> 00:03:37.220]  And if you're wondering where the USDA is in all of this, they're busy force-feeding GMOs to little Chinese children without their parents' consent.
[00:03:37.681 --> 00:03:44.523]  So as you can see, from the White House to Chicago Public Schools to the USDA, everybody wants to tell you what you can put into your body.
[00:03:44.923 --> 00:03:47.944]  Land of the free, home of the brave, but apparently not in the lunchroom.
[00:03:47.964 --> 00:03:50.565]  I'm Jakari Jackson for the InfoWars Nightly News.
