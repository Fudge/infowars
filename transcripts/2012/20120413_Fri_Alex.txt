[00:00:05.032 --> 00:00:06.333]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.094]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.094 --> 00:00:09.855]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:11.456]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.456 --> 00:00:12.997]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.997 --> 00:00:17.179]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:21.301]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:45.491]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, the 13th day.
[00:00:45.491 --> 00:00:49.515]  I just realized it's Friday the 13th.
[00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:52.917]  Seems like just last week we had a Friday the 13th, but I guess that was last year.
[00:00:53.812 --> 00:01:07.842]  And it's a fitting Friday the 13th as we go into the weekend and you have the tribute that's paid yearly to the private collection agency, that's governmental power, but it collects money for the private Federal Reserve.
[00:01:07.842 --> 00:01:12.045]  So the collection agency for the private Federal Reserve.
[00:01:12.045 --> 00:01:14.026]  None of the money goes to run the country.
[00:01:14.026 --> 00:01:20.811]  It goes to siphon off the economy to the foreign mega banks and to pay for the interest
[00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.693]  That we pay the private banks to be able to even have money.
[00:01:26.693 --> 00:01:36.699]  Notice that money in your wallet says Federal Reserve Note, not U.S.
[00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:39.421]  Note.
[00:01:39.421 --> 00:01:47.046]  And in that is the heart of the globalist total control over society, at least the level of economics.
[00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.020]  And they're trying to mop up the few little areas of resistance now.
[00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:02.743]  Anybody with their own swap meat or garage sale or selling vegetables or fruits on the side of the street.
[00:02:02.743 --> 00:02:10.905]  It is really amazing to watch the environmental police fanning out, harassing the population.
[00:02:10.905 --> 00:02:13.446]  We're going to have open phones today.
[00:02:13.446 --> 00:02:16.167]  Open phones throughout the full three hours.
[00:02:17.566 --> 00:02:22.011]  And so I will give you the toll free number to join us after the break.
[00:02:22.011 --> 00:02:31.443]  And you are welcomed and encouraged to join us on any of the issues that are out there on any of the different big developments that are unfolding.
[00:02:31.443 --> 00:02:35.027]  And I will briefly get into some of those big stories on the other side.
[00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:46.884]  The Washington Post and the Daily Mail and others are reporting that Viking Robot found life on Mars in 1976.
[00:02:46.884 --> 00:02:54.989]  They've now tested what they believe were bacteria for the last three decades.
[00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.571]  I guess that's 36 years, technically.
[00:02:57.571 --> 00:03:02.234]  And they are now saying they're 99% sure that it is primitive bacteria.
[00:03:03.857 --> 00:03:13.706]  Now, the problem is, this is coming from a government that has been caught lying so much, you can't believe a word comes out of their mouth.
[00:03:13.706 --> 00:03:17.970]  This could be fiction like Barzoom, you know, the guy that wrote the Tarzan.
[00:03:19.485 --> 00:03:29.171]  King of the Apes books also wrote the John Carter books and other really good fiction.
[00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:35.434]  Is this just more fiction or are there floating cities on Barzoom?
[00:03:35.434 --> 00:03:40.337]  Undoubtedly, Mars has water and has a northern and southern ice cap.
[00:03:42.074 --> 00:03:48.279]  And undoubtedly, Martian rocks do rain down on the Earth when larger meteors hit Mars.
[00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:54.404]  And a lot of scientists believe in the theory of space seeding for life.
[00:03:54.404 --> 00:04:00.348]  That's what my little video piece, Secrets of Prometheus Leaked, is about.
[00:04:00.348 --> 00:04:04.912]  It's about the elite believing that space aliens or gods created the planet.
[00:04:04.912 --> 00:04:06.253]  It doesn't mean I believe that.
[00:04:06.253 --> 00:04:09.535]  I'm saying that's what the Illuminati's deepest belief is.
[00:04:10.455 --> 00:04:17.838]  That's why I made that video that has 400,000 views that we also aired to 3 million listeners and viewers here on the radio show.
[00:04:17.838 --> 00:04:20.939]  But if you miss it, it's one of the better research pieces we've done.
[00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:23.039]  Aaron put about a week's work of
[00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:30.846]  Work into it, and it is out there for everybody to see, but we'll be talking about that.
[00:04:30.846 --> 00:04:33.630]  Also, record numbers of earthquakes taking place.
[00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.275]  I'm going to break that down early in the hour.
[00:04:37.275 --> 00:04:41.682]  Gold resumes surge as new QE rumor is back.
[00:04:43.748 --> 00:04:47.829]  North Korea, the Stalinist state couldn't get their precious little rocket.
[00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:53.691]  They're trying to menace everyone off the ground with that child dictator piece of trash over there.
[00:04:53.691 --> 00:04:56.352]  More government scum I'm supposed to worship.
[00:04:56.352 --> 00:04:58.213]  He's got a fancy hat with badges.
[00:04:58.213 --> 00:04:59.333]  I mean, I need to bow down to him.
[00:05:00.914 --> 00:05:01.974]  I had tried everything.
[00:05:01.974 --> 00:05:04.335]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[00:05:04.335 --> 00:05:07.436]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[00:05:07.436 --> 00:05:12.298]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements, as well as key vitamins.
[00:05:12.298 --> 00:05:19.161]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[00:05:19.161 --> 00:05:29.605]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:05:30.365 --> 00:05:34.828]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[00:05:34.828 --> 00:05:41.112]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:05:41.112 --> 00:05:42.673]  Now that's results.
[00:05:42.673 --> 00:05:49.457]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfoWarsTeam.com and to order just three of their products.
[00:05:49.457 --> 00:05:55.180]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[00:06:00.322 --> 00:06:01.623]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:01.623 --> 00:06:07.208]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:06:07.208 --> 00:06:12.232]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:06:12.232 --> 00:06:17.817]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:06:17.817 --> 00:06:22.481]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[00:07:59.042 --> 00:08:05.887]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.887 --> 00:08:08.169]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:17.686 --> 00:08:31.296]  Ladies and gentlemen...
[00:08:32.916 --> 00:08:40.359]  It is Friday the 13th 2012 and we're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:08:40.359 --> 00:08:44.780]  I will be back this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.982]  Central Standard Time with a live Sunday transmission.
[00:08:49.941 --> 00:09:13.838]  Also, I gotta say it, the investigative reports that my crew is putting together for the radio and for the nightly news, everything we're doing, our team on the ground in Georgia with the suspicious death under Agenda 21 in the seizure of homes for a green space, using zoning to harass people into oblivion, is wild.
[00:09:13.838 --> 00:09:14.418]  Our crew
[00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:21.924]  Tried to go in the City Council peacefully, public building, marked as public, and were told by police they couldn't go in.
[00:09:21.924 --> 00:09:33.752]  And they are back there today demanding to see the law that someone in a uniform just says you can't enter the City Council to try to go to some of the offices and attempt to talk to people.
[00:09:33.752 --> 00:09:36.794]  And I see this all over the country now.
[00:09:36.794 --> 00:09:40.737]  I saw it with the Federal Reserve a few years ago in Kansas City.
[00:09:40.737 --> 00:09:41.998]  I had sent
[00:09:43.092 --> 00:09:55.480]  Aaron Dykes and Rob Jacobson to Kansas City to interview William K. Black, the former top federal regulator of the SNL scandals, who sent a bunch of people to prison.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:05.546]  We were there to interview Professor Black, and they're driving, they had a taxi cab taking them around back to the airport, and they noticed the Federal Reserve Building.
[00:10:05.546 --> 00:10:07.527]  And they said, let's pull over and get some B-roll.
[00:10:08.937 --> 00:10:34.577]  And so they decide about a half mile away, we've shown you the Google Maps on air, to go to the World War I Memorial and shoot some footage of that, and they're up on the parapet area, it's built like a castle, they're at the World War I Memorial, the National World War I Memorial, it's in Kansas City, and they're shooting the video of the Federal Reserve on federal property, well private property, but claiming it's federal,
[00:10:35.819 --> 00:10:39.361]  Far away, totally separate from the city park.
[00:10:39.361 --> 00:10:46.165]  And here comes security guards posing as federal law enforcement with firearms.
[00:10:46.165 --> 00:10:48.527]  And they demanded to see their ID.
[00:10:48.527 --> 00:10:49.667]  They said, I don't have to show it to you.
[00:10:49.667 --> 00:10:51.268]  They put their hands on their guns.
[00:10:51.268 --> 00:10:52.069]  They say, you better.
[00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:54.270]  I have a citizen's arrest.
[00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:57.032]  Well, of course, the security guard has a citizen's arrest power.
[00:10:57.032 --> 00:10:58.613]  You have a citizen's arrest power.
[00:10:59.608 --> 00:11:02.669]  And quite frankly, and by the way, this is already on the books.
[00:11:02.669 --> 00:11:21.458]  They're making a big deal in Indiana about the governor, you know, supporting or the legislature, you know, passing a bill where you can resist a police officer who is engaged in unlawful activity with lethal force.
[00:11:21.458 --> 00:11:23.739]  You don't need to pass a law to say that.
[00:11:23.739 --> 00:11:27.260]  That's already on the books in every state.
[00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.061]  We've had constitutional lawyers on to go over that.
[00:11:32.202 --> 00:11:45.625]  It's just like when the state of Texas tried to pass a law saying the TSA can't grope people's children or adults, and if you touch the genitals, it is a felony.
[00:11:45.625 --> 00:11:47.826]  Well, it's already a felony.
[00:11:47.826 --> 00:11:49.646]  They're not even sworn peace officers.
[00:11:49.646 --> 00:11:53.847]  If a peace officer did that, they would go to jail.
[00:11:56.209 --> 00:11:59.010]  If there wasn't probable cause in an emergency situation.
[00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:01.070]  That is the essence of martial law.
[00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:03.150]  When the normal constitution is suspended.
[00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:07.271]  And that's what they've done, is a soft suspension of the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:12:07.271 --> 00:12:07.992]  But I'm digressing.
[00:12:07.992 --> 00:12:13.833]  The point is, that there's already laws against doing that to people.
[00:12:13.833 --> 00:12:23.635]  That's why courthouses all over the country that have put in naked body scanners, lawyers have pointed out in Colorado and in Florida and other places, hey, it's pedophilia for you to do this to under 18.
[00:12:25.629 --> 00:12:32.432]  You can try to make an adult consent to go into the public building, and even that's unconstitutional, but you better stop.
[00:12:32.432 --> 00:12:40.875]  The state attorneys and others told them, do not touch the genitals, do not touch it on the outside or the inside of under 18s.
[00:12:40.875 --> 00:12:43.236]  Do not do it!
[00:12:43.236 --> 00:12:51.859]  And that was in the Denver Post last year, and it's also been in the Miami Herald, that in Florida and Colorado they've stopped doing that, because they understand it's illegal.
[00:12:52.799 --> 00:13:02.644]  I mean, just because somebody's in a uniform and they show up and pull a gun out and say they're going to kill you, you have a right to defend yourself.
[00:13:02.644 --> 00:13:05.306]  And that's the essence of tyranny.
[00:13:05.306 --> 00:13:10.329]  When people just say, I have a uniform or I'm from the government, you must do what I say.
[00:13:10.329 --> 00:13:14.471]  And there are my reporters, polite, Darren McBrain in a suit, very gentlemanly.
[00:13:14.471 --> 00:13:16.392]  Marcos, very gentlemanly, very polite.
[00:13:18.444 --> 00:13:30.352]  And they're walking up to the city council building, and three cop cars pull up, jump out, get in their face, and say, you're not going in there.
[00:13:30.352 --> 00:13:34.154]  They say, you're not, and by the way, turn your cameras off.
[00:13:34.154 --> 00:13:36.516]  And my reporter said no to that.
[00:13:36.516 --> 00:13:40.138]  But the point is, well, where's the law officer?
[00:13:40.138 --> 00:13:43.921]  You see, police will arrest you, they say, for not following an officer's order.
[00:13:43.921 --> 00:13:45.502]  It's a lawful order.
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:14:05.352]  And a lawful order is you are recklessly driving, pull over.
[00:14:05.352 --> 00:14:08.554]  All of these laws pulling you over are done in the name of an emergency.
[00:14:12.901 --> 00:14:32.488]  But the essence of what's wrong with our country and what's brought every other country that's gone into tyranny to its knees and into all the horrors that come with tyranny and oppression and despotism and out-of-control government, it's people just saying, I've got a uniform and a badge or I'm a bureaucrat and I say you can't enter the building.
[00:14:35.666 --> 00:14:41.691]  And then you're faced with people with guns who are doing something that is illegal.
[00:14:41.691 --> 00:14:48.257]  They are blocking your access to a public building.
[00:14:48.257 --> 00:14:51.599]  They are blocking the press.
[00:14:51.599 --> 00:15:00.967]  They are blocking you from your basic rights, and it is outrageous, and they're so comfortable with it.
[00:15:00.967 --> 00:15:03.690]  And the police officers say to my crew, and they have it all on tape,
[00:15:04.588 --> 00:15:07.692]  We're gonna get back tonight and we'll have it for you on Monday, you know, the high def.
[00:15:07.692 --> 00:15:17.643]  We had some live feeds via Skype on the ground of some of this yesterday on air.
[00:15:17.643 --> 00:15:21.006]  And there are my reporters having to...
[00:15:22.611 --> 00:15:28.256]  Confront officers who say on tape, I'm just following orders, like it's okay.
[00:15:28.256 --> 00:15:37.664]  So there's some city council people who don't want the media coming in so that you can get that 60 minutes moment where you walk in and say, we'd like to talk to the mayor.
[00:15:37.664 --> 00:15:41.368]  We'd like to talk to the head of city zoning.
[00:15:41.368 --> 00:15:45.631]  We'd like documents on this agenda 21 land you were trying to take.
[00:15:45.631 --> 00:15:46.852]  That's what they say in the documents.
[00:15:46.852 --> 00:15:49.535]  We'd like to talk about it and to have them say, no, we're not talking to you.
[00:15:51.877 --> 00:15:55.800]  Or we'd like to go in and see the city records, which you're supposed to do by law.
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.682]  We'd like to go in and do a records request.
[00:15:58.682 --> 00:16:01.824]  And they say no.
[00:16:01.824 --> 00:16:05.647]  Well, you might as well be in North Korea, where the third-generational dictator
[00:16:06.735 --> 00:16:08.176]  Where's a little uniform?
[00:16:08.176 --> 00:16:31.614]  I mean, he's a guy that reportedly lays around all day and watches television and couldn't find his way out of a paper bag and went to school in Switzerland and he just arrives and is the supreme ruler as his whole country collapses and they can't even get a 1950s-era rocket off the ground as to show off and menace everyone into threatening to get more international aid and money.
[00:16:33.155 --> 00:16:39.420]  They are now threatening to detonate an atomic bomb to show everybody how powerful the new leader is.
[00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:44.404]  I mean, that's all government is.
[00:16:44.404 --> 00:16:47.267]  It's an exercise of power.
[00:16:47.267 --> 00:16:49.689]  When the TSA sticks their hands down your pants, which they do,
[00:16:50.933 --> 00:16:55.414]  When they grope your daughter in front of you, it's an exercise of raw power.
[00:16:55.414 --> 00:17:09.056]  Just like that pathetic scumbag, I mean, I was looking at photos that North Korea itself has released of just the little kids, they call them orphanages, and they just put them in beds to starve to death.
[00:17:09.056 --> 00:17:10.736]  That's what the state delivers.
[00:17:10.736 --> 00:17:13.537]  Absolute hell on earth.
[00:17:13.537 --> 00:17:18.458]  And it's now delivering it here in my country.
[00:17:18.458 --> 00:17:18.898]  Agenda 21
[00:17:21.303 --> 00:17:27.606]  is in control to a great extent of the town I live in.
[00:17:27.606 --> 00:17:28.987]  I'm under UN regulations.
[00:17:28.987 --> 00:17:30.808]  They admit it's UN regulations.
[00:17:30.808 --> 00:17:36.011]  The public schools are under UNESCO UN regulations.
[00:17:36.011 --> 00:17:39.773]  Even private schools that are accredited give their children packets
[00:17:41.226 --> 00:17:46.708]  Telling you how wonderful Michelle Obama is and how she cares about you and how she's going to tell you what to eat.
[00:17:46.708 --> 00:17:52.451]  I mean, you're not supposed to have the dear leader's wife in propaganda to your kids.
[00:17:52.451 --> 00:18:00.274]  This is all the trappings of a country hurtling into despotism.
[00:18:00.274 --> 00:18:01.654]  And we're in a depression.
[00:18:01.654 --> 00:18:03.415]  The economy is slowly shutting down.
[00:18:03.415 --> 00:18:05.956]  They're devaluing the currency.
[00:18:05.956 --> 00:18:07.417]  All of this is happening.
[00:18:07.417 --> 00:18:08.257]  Now I'm going to do something.
[00:18:08.257 --> 00:18:10.178]  I'm going to open the phones up first for the rest of the hour.
[00:18:11.007 --> 00:18:16.292]  And then, in the second hour, I will begin getting into the massive news.
[00:18:16.292 --> 00:18:16.572]  U.S.
[00:18:16.572 --> 00:18:23.579]  troops to have supervision as Pentagon orders electronic contact lenses that let them see through drones flying overhead.
[00:18:23.579 --> 00:18:25.921]  That's going to be the cybernetic system.
[00:18:25.921 --> 00:18:26.742]  I'm going to talk about that.
[00:18:30.194 --> 00:18:42.617]  Radar Online, Radar Magazine, makes fun of conservative groups that don't like a new HBO show that shows children doing things that I won't even post on my website even though it's news.
[00:18:42.617 --> 00:18:52.579]  It is five-year-old girls performing artificial oral sex on giant sex toys.
[00:18:52.579 --> 00:18:54.659]  See how they push the line on you?
[00:18:54.659 --> 00:18:56.480]  And people are like, what's the point of that?
[00:18:57.449 --> 00:19:00.930]  It's all psychological warfare.
[00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:03.631]  That's what the TSA's doing this to your children's about.
[00:19:03.631 --> 00:19:04.592]  That's what this is about.
[00:19:04.592 --> 00:19:16.877]  That's what all the violence, it's all meant on record to stunt your conscience, to stunt your mind to where you don't recognize corruption anymore.
[00:19:16.877 --> 00:19:20.918]  I mean, they come out in the news and they give children vaccines without parental consent now.
[00:19:20.918 --> 00:19:22.859]  Totally illegal, they just do it.
[00:19:22.859 --> 00:19:24.680]  California actually passes a law saying they can do it.
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:25.280]  It's still illegal.
[00:19:26.411 --> 00:19:27.934]  Pass a law saying blacks are slaves.
[00:19:27.934 --> 00:19:28.655]  Still illegal.
[00:19:28.655 --> 00:19:30.077]  I say it's a fraud.
[00:19:30.077 --> 00:19:31.620]  Goes against common sense and common law.
[00:19:32.964 --> 00:19:35.065]  They take your children for not having vaccines.
[00:19:35.065 --> 00:19:35.546]  There's no law.
[00:19:35.546 --> 00:19:35.886]  They just do it.
[00:19:35.886 --> 00:19:36.386]  That's what I mean.
[00:19:36.386 --> 00:19:38.367]  It's a lawlessness.
[00:19:38.367 --> 00:19:40.989]  And I was on drugs today looking at the Radar article.
[00:19:40.989 --> 00:19:42.230]  I linked over to it.
[00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:45.892]  And I told my webmasters, I said, you know, I don't even want to link to this.
[00:19:45.892 --> 00:19:48.054]  But I guess I'm going to tell Kurt to actually write an article about it.
[00:19:48.054 --> 00:19:51.916]  I mean, I was looking at this stuff and I was like, really?
[00:19:51.916 --> 00:19:54.798]  This is the promos running on HBO?
[00:19:54.798 --> 00:19:56.099]  Five and six year old girls?
[00:20:00.118 --> 00:20:05.120]  I just... You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.600]  Everyone can feel it.
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:15.483]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[00:20:15.483 --> 00:20:18.664]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[00:20:18.664 --> 00:20:19.984]  But take heart.
[00:20:19.984 --> 00:20:23.765]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[00:20:23.765 --> 00:20:28.747]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[00:20:29.167 --> 00:20:33.009]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[00:20:33.009 --> 00:20:34.729]  The globalists are scared.
[00:20:34.729 --> 00:20:36.070]  They've overreached.
[00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:39.571]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[00:22:30.764 --> 00:22:35.327]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:35.327 --> 00:22:41.151]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:22:41.151 --> 00:22:44.793]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:22:59.944 --> 00:23:02.566]  We all know the importance of having storable foods.
[00:23:02.566 --> 00:23:04.627]  But what about when the food runs out?
[00:23:04.627 --> 00:23:06.509]  What then?

[00:24:10.595 --> 00:24:21.747]  Michelle, one of the customer service people here at InfoWars, was here with her three-year-old daughter this morning, brought her to work with her.
[00:24:21.747 --> 00:24:23.528]  And of course, I've known her since she was born.
[00:24:23.528 --> 00:24:24.529]  Very, very sweet.
[00:24:24.529 --> 00:24:27.713]  I know her older daughter, I guess who's nine years old now.
[00:24:27.713 --> 00:24:32.478]  And it was a year and a half ago or so that her story of flying back into Austin from
[00:24:35.174 --> 00:24:45.760]  Denver, and how they had a big pot-bellied man come over, and before she even knew what was going on, start trying to go in her eight-year-old daughter's pants at the time.
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.742]  I guess seven and a half at the time.
[00:24:48.742 --> 00:24:49.883]  And she said, no, no, no.
[00:24:49.883 --> 00:24:52.764]  And they said, oh, yes, we'll get a woman to do it.
[00:24:52.764 --> 00:24:53.705]  Like it's okay.
[00:24:53.705 --> 00:25:03.791]  I mean, let me tell you, when I was flying back from Las Vegas from doing a video shoot, and they sent over a man, it made it even worse that it was
[00:25:06.451 --> 00:25:12.115]  And I just said, do not, do not touch me down there, I'm going to sue you, and he didn't.
[00:25:12.115 --> 00:25:13.576]  He said the fake frisk.
[00:25:13.576 --> 00:25:16.379]  Again, the idea that I'm guilty until proven slave.
[00:25:16.379 --> 00:25:21.162]  Guilty until proven slave of Goldman Sachs, under the Goldman Sachs dictatorship.
[00:25:21.162 --> 00:25:23.044]  I mean, that's what we're under.
[00:25:23.044 --> 00:25:32.111]  Even Economist Magazine and Financial Times of London admit Europe is under a Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan dictatorship of fraud.
[00:25:33.123 --> 00:25:38.387]  Getting Europe to sign on to their debt and then destroying their economies by design.
[00:25:38.387 --> 00:25:40.708]  I mean, Greece is war in the streets.
[00:25:40.708 --> 00:25:43.210]  People dumping their kids out at government buildings.
[00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:46.852]  Cholera, other diseases, malaria has showed back up.
[00:25:46.852 --> 00:25:48.293]  Hadn't been there in hundreds of years.
[00:25:48.293 --> 00:25:50.955]  I mean, it's collapse.
[00:25:50.955 --> 00:25:52.596]  You're like, why do the bankers want that?
[00:25:52.596 --> 00:25:53.557]  They want to make money.
[00:25:53.557 --> 00:25:54.257]  No, they don't.
[00:25:54.257 --> 00:25:55.318]  They print the money.
[00:25:55.318 --> 00:25:58.841]  They want to implode that country and buy it up.
[00:25:58.841 --> 00:26:01.823]  And make everybody poor as a weapon of control.
[00:26:03.689 --> 00:26:06.311]  It's their nature, they're nasty, evil people.
[00:26:06.311 --> 00:26:08.432]  That's why they're in control, because they're ruthless.
[00:26:08.432 --> 00:26:22.520]  All right, continuing here, and I'm gonna go to break and come back with your calls in the long segment coming up.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:27.043]  Because I digress, seeing her little daughter in here, so innocent.
[00:26:28.737 --> 00:26:35.761]  And I think about how innocent my children are, and how I have to keep them away from television.
[00:26:35.761 --> 00:26:43.746]  Even, you know, Christian friends and people, I can't really send them over to be at people's houses if they watch television at all because of what's on it.
[00:26:43.746 --> 00:26:47.808]  I can't even really let them go to my parents and watch a football game because of the ads.
[00:26:47.808 --> 00:26:50.290]  People are like, oh, come on, it's not a big deal.
[00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:56.834]  My parents aren't, but other people are like, I can't be in a pizza place with my children with the TV on, with the stuff that's there now.
[00:26:58.238 --> 00:27:19.846]  HBO is coming out with a primetime show called Angry Boys that shows little girls who are so innocent and so good with giant sex toys sucking on them.
[00:27:19.846 --> 00:27:21.447]  I mean, what else am I supposed to say?
[00:27:21.447 --> 00:27:24.388]  This is what they put on television.
[00:27:29.201 --> 00:27:34.104]  It shows giant cups that are the shapes of men's genitals.
[00:27:34.104 --> 00:27:35.965]  And this is what they do.
[00:27:35.965 --> 00:27:38.186]  And I can't even get into the rest of it here on air.
[00:27:38.186 --> 00:27:39.507]  It gets worse.
[00:27:39.507 --> 00:27:42.489]  On adult radio.
[00:27:42.489 --> 00:27:44.490]  And it's such a crime.
[00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:46.831]  This is attacking innocence.
[00:27:46.831 --> 00:27:48.012]  That's what the sex ed is.
[00:27:48.012 --> 00:27:51.834]  They're not trying to teach in public schools worldwide under UN standardization.
[00:27:51.834 --> 00:27:52.555]  It's all UNESCO.
[00:27:52.555 --> 00:27:54.356]  It's the same from Australia to the US.
[00:27:54.356 --> 00:27:56.417]  From Germany to Denmark.
[00:27:56.417 --> 00:27:57.578]  It's global standardization.
[00:27:59.534 --> 00:28:04.215]  They don't teach you, hey, if you have sex you can catch these diseases like they tell you they do.
[00:28:04.215 --> 00:28:05.776]  No.
[00:28:05.776 --> 00:28:09.877]  It was all about how to have sex.
[00:28:09.877 --> 00:28:19.280]  And I'll tell you, when I was sitting there in middle school with sex education, all it was making me do was look over at the girl next to me and her look over at me.
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:22.541]  All it was doing was sexualizing and destroying innocence.
[00:28:24.053 --> 00:28:24.453]  I don't know.
[00:28:43.732 --> 00:28:46.115]  You know, Billy has two daddies, all this.
[00:28:46.115 --> 00:28:47.797]  This is what they teach children.
[00:28:47.797 --> 00:28:52.823]  And then they teach them stuff that I didn't even know about sexually until I was in college.
[00:28:52.823 --> 00:28:57.248]  Stuff I've never even heard of as an adult.
[00:28:57.248 --> 00:28:59.030]  They teach children and now...
[00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:01.731]  You watch everything on television.
[00:29:01.731 --> 00:29:02.811]  It's anti-male.
[00:29:02.811 --> 00:29:04.011]  It's wussification.
[00:29:04.011 --> 00:29:05.632]  Women run everything.
[00:29:05.632 --> 00:29:06.672]  It's degeneracy.
[00:29:06.672 --> 00:29:07.993]  Everything's a joke.
[00:29:07.993 --> 00:29:11.034]  They're turning us into animals that can't resist.
[00:29:11.034 --> 00:29:15.495]  And all the violence desensitizes people.
[00:29:15.495 --> 00:29:16.376]  The studies show it.
[00:29:16.376 --> 00:29:20.297]  People can't differentiate all the simulated murders and video games and television.
[00:29:21.491 --> 00:29:23.372]  With the real thing.
[00:29:23.372 --> 00:29:24.734]  So it's like, oh, where'd the neighbor go?
[00:29:24.734 --> 00:29:25.754]  Oh, they arrested him.
[00:29:25.754 --> 00:29:27.115]  Oh, yeah, they killed the neighbor.
[00:29:27.115 --> 00:29:27.556]  He's dead.
[00:29:27.556 --> 00:29:28.516]  They burned his house down.
[00:29:28.516 --> 00:29:32.459]  He wouldn't give it to the, you know, the feds for a green zone.
[00:29:32.459 --> 00:29:36.162]  And then reporters show up and try to walk into city council, like, no, you're not allowed to come in a public building.
[00:29:36.162 --> 00:29:36.843]  There's no law.
[00:29:36.843 --> 00:29:37.463]  We got guns.
[00:29:37.463 --> 00:29:41.506]  Why don't you go watch HBO where they take six-year-old girls?
[00:29:41.506 --> 00:29:44.809]  I mean, folks, these are little bitty innocent girls.
[00:29:44.809 --> 00:29:46.830]  It makes me feel very violent.
[00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:47.831]  I'm going to be honest with people.
[00:29:49.878 --> 00:29:53.809]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.809 --> 00:29:56.476]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.492 --> 00:30:04.136]  Four, five, six, even seven dollars a gallon?

[00:31:07.865 --> 00:31:13.008]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:31:13.008 --> 00:31:19.752]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:31:21.738 --> 00:31:28.121]  They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:34.823]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:31:34.823 --> 00:31:39.886]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it, others don't.
[00:31:39.886 --> 00:31:42.027]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:31:42.027 --> 00:31:43.828]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[00:31:56.035 --> 00:31:59.257]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it, others don't.
[00:32:00.535 --> 00:32:07.758]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[00:32:07.758 --> 00:32:25.627]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:32:25.627 --> 00:32:29.749]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[00:32:30.029 --> 00:32:31.790]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:39.956]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[00:33:14.405 --> 00:33:15.726]  affiliates, XM Channel 166.
[00:33:18.977 --> 00:33:31.350]  WWCR global shortwave worldwide and of course audio streams at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and of course video streams at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:34.173]  Again I want to thank you all for joining us today.
[00:33:34.173 --> 00:33:38.098]  I'm gonna go to your calls here in just a moment and later I'm gonna get into this but I it is so
[00:33:40.305 --> 00:33:41.326]  Over the top.
[00:33:41.326 --> 00:33:43.487]  But see, soon it won't be.
[00:33:43.487 --> 00:33:45.809]  They just always take a little more, a little more.
[00:33:45.809 --> 00:34:00.618]  Until, in the United States, on cable TV, they have children doing things that, according to federal law, are illegal.
[00:34:01.673 --> 00:34:10.924]  They've tried to pass laws that I believe are unconstitutional, even though I do find these practices disgusting and distasteful, of drawings of underage sex.
[00:34:12.637 --> 00:34:17.898]  There's a reason cultures have all gone after people that mess with children.
[00:34:17.898 --> 00:34:19.298]  A, it's unnatural.
[00:34:19.298 --> 00:34:20.598]  B, it's predatory.
[00:34:20.598 --> 00:34:25.359]  It's preying on the most defenseless and the heart of humanity.
[00:34:25.359 --> 00:34:26.399]  This war on children.
[00:34:26.399 --> 00:34:30.420]  All these sitcoms and dramas act like it's terrible to have children.
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:34.901]  You'll get some empty, mindless yuppie come up and laugh at you.
[00:34:34.901 --> 00:34:37.742]  I've had it in grocery stores for having three children.
[00:34:37.742 --> 00:34:39.962]  People that I know that have five or six get harassed.
[00:34:41.604 --> 00:34:57.103]  Because these people, it's their religion, the television's their friend, those messages on TV are their friend, and they have this gibbering disdain in their false reality for those of us that actually are part of the human race, and part of consciousness, and part of reality.
[00:34:59.252 --> 00:35:04.996]  And so, demonize men, demonize the family, demonize people that are straight.
[00:35:04.996 --> 00:35:09.258]  See, it's not just, oh, don't attack people that are into alternative lifestyles.
[00:35:09.258 --> 00:35:15.022]  No, it's attack people that are straight.
[00:35:15.022 --> 00:35:22.867]  One time I got invited to someone's birthday party, and that person was gay.
[00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:26.122]  And again, I don't dislike people that are gay.
[00:35:26.122 --> 00:35:35.110]  And I go to the party, and I'm there with my wife, and probably half the people that were there were, you know, that sexual preference.
[00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:37.132]  I was just, you know, trying to be nice, fine, whatever.
[00:35:37.132 --> 00:35:38.253]  I don't care.
[00:35:38.253 --> 00:35:39.714]  You know, I'm not obsessed with it.
[00:35:39.714 --> 00:35:46.160]  It's not like something I'm, you know, just my whole life is about obsessing about like the media does, and just pushing it constantly.
[00:35:48.015 --> 00:35:55.198]  And I probably had 10 people out of 40 or so at the thing go, ooh, you've got kids, ooh, ooh.
[00:35:55.198 --> 00:35:57.759]  And it's just like, I didn't even bring my kids up.
[00:35:57.759 --> 00:35:59.400]  Oh, diapers, gross.
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:02.581]  And I'm just like, come on, let's just get out of here.
[00:36:02.581 --> 00:36:07.843]  It's just like, I don't need to hear how I'm bad all day, okay?
[00:36:07.843 --> 00:36:13.466]  And that's what this is about, going into the schools, going into the cultures, and pushing this on people.
[00:36:15.509 --> 00:36:18.352]  Because it's not just the sexual act.
[00:36:18.352 --> 00:36:21.155]  And I'm not saying everybody that's involved in that's doing that.
[00:36:21.155 --> 00:36:27.602]  I'm saying it's the politicization and this agenda, and it's like a gang.
[00:36:27.602 --> 00:36:31.066]  But it's not just a gang and the sexual preferences or whatever.
[00:36:31.066 --> 00:36:32.788]  It's the whole deal.
[00:36:32.788 --> 00:36:36.112]  Germany passes laws, no new single-family homes by 2020.
[00:36:37.313 --> 00:36:41.258]  Huge fines and fees if you have them now.
[00:36:41.258 --> 00:36:43.200]  You will live in communal dorms.
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:48.446]  That's what Mao Zedong tried, and it killed, the Chinese say, 86 million.
[00:36:48.446 --> 00:36:51.109]  The CIA says 64 million.
[00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.890]  You look it up.
[00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:53.271]  There's a debate.
[00:36:53.271 --> 00:36:56.215]  60-something, 80-something mill, whatever.
[00:36:56.215 --> 00:36:57.476]  I mean, folks, they killed
[00:36:58.357 --> 00:37:01.039]  Tens of millions of people trying this.
[00:37:01.039 --> 00:37:07.985]  The globalists say, if we can ever end the normal human cycle and create an artificial one, we've won.
[00:37:07.985 --> 00:37:14.110]  It's a revolution against humanity and our basic system by control freaks that want to play God.
[00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:15.491]  And where does communism come from?
[00:37:16.949 --> 00:37:20.152]  It comes from the Jacobins and other Illuminati groups.
[00:37:20.152 --> 00:37:22.334]  I mean, mainline history books.
[00:37:22.334 --> 00:37:26.357]  Illuminati, Jacobins, France, French Revolution.
[00:37:26.357 --> 00:37:27.458]  This is real history.
[00:37:27.458 --> 00:37:30.561]  George Washington wrote and spoke on this.
[00:37:30.561 --> 00:37:31.141]  Okay?
[00:37:31.141 --> 00:37:31.902]  This is history.
[00:37:34.019 --> 00:37:35.900]  After our revolution, they have their own.
[00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.662]  And let me tell you, it was pure Illuminati.
[00:37:38.662 --> 00:37:40.443]  Totally different than ours.
[00:37:40.443 --> 00:37:49.068]  Fashioning itself off what George Washington did on the surface, but beneath the surface, they tried to go to a nine-day week.
[00:37:49.068 --> 00:37:51.589]  They tried to change the seasons.
[00:37:51.589 --> 00:37:53.070]  They tried to end families.
[00:37:54.704 --> 00:37:56.808]  They tried to... Oh yes!
[00:37:56.808 --> 00:37:58.150]  Oh yes!
[00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:00.594]  Marx and Engels didn't write the Communist Manifesto.
[00:38:00.594 --> 00:38:02.517]  That had all been pushed under other names.
[00:38:02.517 --> 00:38:05.262]  The Rothschilds openly financed it all.
[00:38:05.262 --> 00:38:06.724]  They financed the Jacobins.
[00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:11.573]  It was not about overthrowing the church and kicking out the monarchy.
[00:38:11.573 --> 00:38:16.058]  It was about overthrowing humanity and making themselves God.
[00:38:16.058 --> 00:38:24.227]  And by the 1850s, they'd hired most of the top scientists to come up with plans to totally take over society and re-engineer it.
[00:38:24.227 --> 00:38:25.168]  And that's what this is.
[00:38:25.168 --> 00:38:27.010]  And now California is set to pass a bill
[00:38:27.751 --> 00:38:31.974]  Just like the one they passed last year to forcibly inoculate your children without your knowledge.
[00:38:31.974 --> 00:38:35.858]  I mean, that is, that is total assault.
[00:38:35.858 --> 00:38:37.519]  That is totally illegal.
[00:38:37.519 --> 00:38:39.300]  That is, I don't care if you pass a law.
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.802]  I mean, that is tyranny.
[00:38:41.802 --> 00:38:45.205]  It isn't just going to stop with highway checkpoints and hands down the pants.
[00:38:45.205 --> 00:38:47.567]  It's not going to just stop with inoculations of your children.
[00:38:50.063 --> 00:39:03.868]  He got thrown out of federal court three years ago, but California lower courts ruled the parents are no longer the guardians, and when your child is in public school, that you cease to be the guardian and the state is now the guardian, even when your child's out of school.
[00:39:03.868 --> 00:39:07.789]  And that homeschooling is illegal because parents are not allowed to be guardians.
[00:39:07.789 --> 00:39:10.110]  And it did get overthrown.
[00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:11.230]  It did get overturned.
[00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:18.012]  But I'm telling you, man, look, these people are hard core scientific authoritarians.
[00:39:18.012 --> 00:39:19.253]  And they mean business.
[00:39:20.506 --> 00:39:23.889]  Now, they've got armies of pedophiles that work for them because they're giving access to children.
[00:39:23.889 --> 00:39:25.530]  They've got other criminal groups.
[00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:28.953]  They've got different brigades of different types of crime groups.
[00:39:28.953 --> 00:39:30.534]  They can destroy whenever they want.
[00:39:30.534 --> 00:39:32.876]  They can blackmail who are given access.
[00:39:32.876 --> 00:39:33.837]  You want drugs.
[00:39:33.837 --> 00:39:34.557]  You want money.
[00:39:34.557 --> 00:39:35.618]  You want power.
[00:39:35.618 --> 00:39:37.180]  You want to torture people.
[00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:38.481]  You want to rape children.
[00:39:38.481 --> 00:39:44.626]  They've got different brigades, but their strongest brigade is the Potbelly Pedophile Brigade.
[00:39:44.626 --> 00:39:45.867]  And it's just an archetype.
[00:39:45.867 --> 00:39:47.148]  It's the Potbelly Pedophile Brigade.
[00:39:48.118 --> 00:39:52.660]  Or the butch pedophile sadomasochistic torture brigade.
[00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:54.420]  They've got that brigade.
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:56.361]  They've got the mercenary brigades.
[00:39:56.361 --> 00:39:58.061]  They've got the torture brigades.
[00:39:58.061 --> 00:39:59.942]  They've got the control freak brigades.
[00:39:59.942 --> 00:40:06.544]  They've got the Dudley Do-Right danger brigades, who actually think they're doing good and are so stupid, they just worship authority.
[00:40:06.544 --> 00:40:10.546]  That's another dangerous brigade we face.
[00:40:10.546 --> 00:40:14.467]  And it's a psych warfare thing on HBO.
[00:40:14.467 --> 00:40:16.047]  I don't even watch mainline television.
[00:40:16.047 --> 00:40:17.188]  Anytime my wife watches it,
[00:40:18.314 --> 00:40:20.235]  She's just like, my gosh, it's all anti-family.
[00:40:20.235 --> 00:40:25.739]  It's all get abortions, kill babies, world government, take vaccines, arrest those that don't.
[00:40:25.739 --> 00:40:30.962]  And cops watch TV where they arrest people who don't take vaccines in dramas.
[00:40:30.962 --> 00:40:33.244]  There's no law, but then they simulate it.
[00:40:33.244 --> 00:40:40.148]  So when they're taking your kid, they're like, well, I mean, you know, the sitcoms, the dramas.
[00:40:40.148 --> 00:40:47.293]  Folks, I'm talking over the years, we've identified dozens and dozens of cases on shows without even looking, where they take kids for not taking vaccines.
[00:40:48.462 --> 00:40:49.583]  And so it must be in hundreds.
[00:40:49.583 --> 00:40:56.566]  I mean, the point is they simulate and show you things that aren't real, and then everyone follows it.
[00:40:56.566 --> 00:40:59.227]  This is called mind control.
[00:40:59.227 --> 00:41:01.508]  This is mind control.
[00:41:01.508 --> 00:41:05.890]  They've got 110,000-plus U.S.
[00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:12.913]  active-duty combat on psychotropics that they know is causing them to kill people and their families, and epidemics of suicides.
[00:41:12.913 --> 00:41:17.135]  The drug inserts they give troops for being depressed says will cause suicide.
[00:41:18.297 --> 00:41:20.399]  I mean, that's what I mean.
[00:41:20.399 --> 00:41:30.368]  It's like children on HBO with giant sexual organ toys with candy and drinks in them with the children.
[00:41:30.368 --> 00:41:33.211]  I mean, it is so sick, man.
[00:41:33.211 --> 00:41:36.253]  This is how pedophiles get kids in cars is with candy.
[00:41:36.253 --> 00:41:42.139]  And they've got kids with candy and soft drinks drinking it out of giant
[00:41:43.433 --> 00:41:46.095]  Artificial male sex organs.
[00:41:46.095 --> 00:41:49.358]  And again, it's going to get crazier and crazier and crazier.
[00:41:49.358 --> 00:41:55.063]  This is a total assault on humanity.
[00:41:55.063 --> 00:42:03.050]  And then I read the media and they're like making fun of conservative and Christian groups that think this is bad.
[00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:06.473]  And I'm telling you folks, I don't want violence in this country.
[00:42:06.473 --> 00:42:09.676]  I've done everything I can to try to stop it and try to turn things back.
[00:42:11.306 --> 00:42:16.828]  Do not try to come and give my children inoculations secretly or if they were in a government training camp.
[00:42:16.828 --> 00:42:21.490]  And they want to bankrupt the economy, which they've done, so you basically have to have them in there.
[00:42:21.490 --> 00:42:27.091]  The quote, free education paid for with the property tax that turned us all into renters on our own property.
[00:42:27.091 --> 00:42:29.092]  We didn't have that until 60 years ago.
[00:42:29.092 --> 00:42:32.193]  Churches weren't 501c3 until 60 years ago or so.
[00:42:32.193 --> 00:42:35.374]  It's a total overthrow of everything.
[00:42:35.374 --> 00:42:39.816]  But do not get around my children, you pedophiles, and don't try to shoot anybody up.
[00:42:40.674 --> 00:42:48.057]  Let me tell you, you think you're all dug in and you know you're starting a fight with us so the cops are all in body armor and armored vehicles?
[00:42:48.057 --> 00:42:52.658]  That's not going to mean anything when you mess with people's kids, okay?
[00:42:52.658 --> 00:43:03.742]  And you enforcers out there need to decide what side you're on, man, because it could not be clearer how ridiculous this is.
[00:43:03.742 --> 00:43:07.924]  I don't think we have HBO on our DISH network.
[00:43:08.863 --> 00:43:10.064]  Out in the country.
[00:43:10.064 --> 00:43:10.884]  And we don't even really use it.
[00:43:10.884 --> 00:43:12.685]  We should just cancel it.
[00:43:12.685 --> 00:43:13.646]  It's incredibly clear.
[00:43:13.646 --> 00:43:14.886]  Hi, it's nice HD.
[00:43:14.886 --> 00:43:17.328]  It's good to watch science programs with my kids.
[00:43:17.328 --> 00:43:21.850]  But that's always got some anti-human brainwashing in it.
[00:43:21.850 --> 00:43:23.731]  Everyone should dump HBO.
[00:43:23.731 --> 00:43:28.194]  I mean, I think I'm calling for a boycott of it right now, but that's not enough.
[00:43:28.194 --> 00:43:31.536]  They should be the I don't care if they say it's a comedy show.
[00:43:31.536 --> 00:43:36.799]  They have real children who they got their parents, I guess, who want to be stars or whatever.
[00:43:38.757 --> 00:43:41.419]  And stuck him in this, and they need to be arrested, okay?
[00:43:41.419 --> 00:43:51.326]  It is, it is, they were trying to train children and desensitize them and associate candy with, they're not even, they are ruining these, this is illegal.
[00:43:51.326 --> 00:44:00.472]  This is illegal, this is illegal, this is illegal, this is illegal!
[00:44:00.472 --> 00:44:05.336]  And I just, I just, again, they're pushing us, they want the fight, they want the fight.
[00:44:08.499 --> 00:44:11.120]  And you know, once the fight starts, it's going to be indiscriminate.
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:15.681]  Let me tell you something.
[00:44:15.681 --> 00:44:25.443]  You either better join the Republic if this thing goes physical, or you better get ready for punishment and judgment.
[00:44:25.443 --> 00:44:28.424]  That's all I can say, because let me tell you, you're part of this system.
[00:44:28.424 --> 00:44:37.806]  When all this stuff goes down, all the bankers set offshore, because they're
[00:44:39.636 --> 00:44:43.697]  They're not going to stop.
[00:44:43.697 --> 00:44:49.339]  The crimes this system commits against us... Alright, I said I'd take calls.
[00:44:49.339 --> 00:44:50.899]  I'll take calls for about 40 minutes.
[00:44:50.899 --> 00:44:53.600]  I'll try to shut up.
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.080]  And then I'll get into all the other news.
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:56.200]  I haven't even got into it yet.
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:57.421]  Huge earthquakes increasing.
[00:44:57.421 --> 00:44:58.481]  I've got the numbers.
[00:44:58.481 --> 00:44:59.701]  Big economy news.
[00:44:59.701 --> 00:45:00.682]  Big high-tech news.
[00:45:00.682 --> 00:45:01.502]  North Korea news.
[00:45:02.577 --> 00:45:03.738]  I didn't even cover this yesterday.
[00:45:03.738 --> 00:45:04.678]  It's such big news.
[00:45:04.678 --> 00:45:10.141]  The Washington Post came out and admitted that Bilderberg is choosing vice presidential candidates.
[00:45:10.141 --> 00:45:21.128]  So they've gone from saying it doesn't exist in the Washington Post for 60 plus years being at all the Bilderberg meetings, the Graham family, and saying it didn't exist to now just admitting that they choose VPs.
[00:45:21.128 --> 00:45:23.549]  See, they're coming out in the open.
[00:45:23.549 --> 00:45:25.090]  Yeah, Bilderberg runs things.
[00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:28.152]  And yeah, we're going to teach kids that pedophiles can have their way with them.
[00:45:28.152 --> 00:45:29.233]  I mean, it's just like, what?
[00:45:30.495 --> 00:45:32.736]  Yeah, world government's taking over, uh-huh.
[00:45:32.736 --> 00:45:36.297]  Yeah, we took that guy's land for agenda 21, he's dead now.
[00:45:36.297 --> 00:45:42.759]  And don't try to go on the city council building.
[00:45:42.759 --> 00:45:51.122]  It's a psy-op to just totally blow us away, and it's not having that effect on me.
[00:45:51.122 --> 00:45:55.984]  You gotta do a banner hang, you gotta write websites on the Federal Reserve money, you've got to...
[00:45:56.994 --> 00:45:58.834]  You've got to get a bullhorn out today.
[00:45:58.834 --> 00:46:00.035]  You've got to do whatever you got.
[00:46:00.035 --> 00:46:04.856]  You got to make a splash in a peaceful but aggressive way.
[00:46:04.856 --> 00:46:14.259]  Because the inability to make some sacrifices now, there were some other report about a cop getting attacked by some guy and shot and people watch the fight go on for like 10 minutes.
[00:46:14.259 --> 00:46:15.459]  It didn't help the police officer.
[00:46:17.691 --> 00:46:22.394]  And that's because people see the police now as not their friends, even though in most cases that's not the case.
[00:46:22.394 --> 00:46:24.935]  The system hasn't fully warped the police yet, on average.
[00:46:24.935 --> 00:46:34.761]  That's why they're trying to create the TSA as this new whole cloth thing, you know, where they have no training and just do one thing, follow orders.
[00:46:34.761 --> 00:46:41.926]  But I see it everywhere now where people are raped in broad daylight, hurt, run over in front of hundreds of people, no one helps them.
[00:46:41.926 --> 00:46:45.148]  And it's because they've turned people into just these spectating
[00:46:46.744 --> 00:47:01.671]  Emasculated, wussified, little jellyfish creatures who just bumble around like mole rats or something on parade.
[00:47:01.671 --> 00:47:05.393]  Simply put, evil has been released into the world at a level ever before seen.
[00:47:05.393 --> 00:47:08.234]  And I can feel it and I can see it intellectually.
[00:47:08.234 --> 00:47:09.415]  We're about to take the plunge.
[00:47:11.311 --> 00:47:16.916]  And I'm going to tell you again, ladies and gentlemen, appeasing this is not going to make your life get better, okay?
[00:47:16.916 --> 00:47:29.766]  America had half the wealth in the world, was 5% of the population, not because we were perfect, but because our forebears were mean and aggressive and independent and would not be pushed around and would rather die than be a slave.
[00:47:29.766 --> 00:47:32.888]  And so we bathed in wealth and power.
[00:47:32.888 --> 00:47:37.012]  And so we became the center of the New World Order because it took us over knowing it was the engine.
[00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:40.241]  And now we are rotting.
[00:47:40.241 --> 00:47:44.323]  America is a rotting corpse of the old republic.
[00:47:44.323 --> 00:47:57.050]  And people are now seeing the maggots spill out, and the guts are all blown up and swollen, and the stench, and the global banker vultures are eating our flesh.
[00:47:57.050 --> 00:47:59.811]  But a republic is not an individual.
[00:47:59.811 --> 00:48:01.072]  It's an idea.
[00:48:01.072 --> 00:48:02.032]  It's a system.
[00:48:02.032 --> 00:48:02.953]  It can rise again.
[00:48:02.953 --> 00:48:04.674]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:48:05.822 --> 00:48:07.304]  Robert in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:48:07.304 --> 00:48:08.286]  First caller of the day.
[00:48:08.286 --> 00:48:10.168]  Welcome.
[00:48:10.168 --> 00:48:11.831]  Thanks for having me on.
[00:48:11.831 --> 00:48:14.314]  First off, I'm pretty sure that
[00:48:15.214 --> 00:48:17.576]  Missile that North Korea launched was shot down.
[00:48:17.576 --> 00:48:20.838]  I would be willing to bet that somebody shot it down with a laser.
[00:48:20.838 --> 00:48:21.759]  Yeah, they got lasers.
[00:48:21.759 --> 00:48:24.701]  They can have C-130s, what, 50 miles away and do it.
[00:48:24.701 --> 00:48:27.203]  They've also got mirror refractors on the satellites.
[00:48:27.203 --> 00:48:35.789]  And I meant to say that I've talked to some of the people involved in Star Wars, and every time North Korea tries to shoot one, it now blows off shortly after it leaves the tarmac.
[00:48:37.332 --> 00:48:47.162]  Well, I have a pretty good source from the Department of Energy who tells me that we got stuff that makes all conventional weaponry out there obsolete.
[00:48:47.162 --> 00:48:48.964]  Again, the bankers have that.
[00:48:48.964 --> 00:48:56.091]  They have particle beams, but just the chemical lasers they admit they have on drones and in those DC-10s are amazing.
[00:48:57.281 --> 00:49:03.905]  Well, once they roll it out and tell people about it, then you can pretty much bet it's in itself obsolete and there's something better than that.
[00:49:03.905 --> 00:49:05.645]  Yes, it's at least 50 years old.
[00:49:05.645 --> 00:49:08.107]  Yeah, chemical lasers on aircraft is at least from the 1950s, yeah.
[00:49:08.107 --> 00:49:17.612]  Hey, real quick, if you are in South Central Texas area, there's a Freedom Bash coming up to support We Are Change.
[00:49:19.615 --> 00:49:23.459]  It's at the Happy Cow in New Braunfels.
[00:49:23.459 --> 00:49:25.961]  I have the address and the map for it.
[00:49:25.961 --> 00:49:26.642]  Very exciting.
[00:49:26.642 --> 00:49:27.663]  Okay, give us the website.
[00:49:27.663 --> 00:49:29.244]  Okay, what's the website?
[00:49:29.244 --> 00:49:31.446]  It's on Funkmaster5.com.
[00:49:31.446 --> 00:49:33.148]  The map and the address there.
[00:49:33.148 --> 00:49:34.249]  Come support We Are Change.
[00:49:34.249 --> 00:49:36.731]  There's live music, food and beer.
[00:49:36.731 --> 00:49:38.633]  Very exciting.
[00:49:38.633 --> 00:49:39.574]  That sounds evil though.
[00:49:39.574 --> 00:49:41.375]  They may have to send some FBI agents to that.
[00:49:41.375 --> 00:49:43.758]  People congregating, wanting to get America back.
[00:49:44.901 --> 00:49:46.901]  And we are changing, exposing Al Gore.
[00:49:46.901 --> 00:49:48.062]  This is horrible.
[00:49:48.062 --> 00:49:49.462]  This is extreme.
[00:49:49.462 --> 00:49:51.102]  This is terrible.
[00:49:51.102 --> 00:49:57.083]  But the media says it's okay to show five and six year old girls engaging in simulated sex acts.
[00:49:57.083 --> 00:50:07.085]  And man, I go to the mall every once in a while and I see billboards and it looks like ten year olds half naked with these different clothing lines and I'm like, man, I like their clothes.
[00:50:07.085 --> 00:50:08.945]  I can't buy this now.
[00:50:08.945 --> 00:50:13.446]  I mean, it's so, they know if they can get you, if they can screw you up,
[00:50:14.653 --> 00:50:16.213]  First, they tell you there is no morals.
[00:50:16.213 --> 00:50:17.494]  That's a big lie, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:17.494 --> 00:50:21.735]  There's basic code of what makes society successful.
[00:50:21.735 --> 00:50:23.296]  And the thing is, we're going to break.
[00:50:23.296 --> 00:50:24.316]  I'm going to come back with more calls.
[00:50:24.316 --> 00:50:29.358]  We're going to go to KJ, Joseph, Fred, Mike, and others.
[00:50:29.358 --> 00:50:39.541]  And NASA says they've proven life on Mars.
[00:50:39.541 --> 00:50:42.321]  You know, he just mentioned, you know, the advanced technologies.
[00:50:42.321 --> 00:50:43.702]  That's why the elites are so crazy.
[00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:56.206]  And now they're just trying to dumb us down and get us addled and confused to the point where we won't organize resistance when they release a genetically engineered bioweapon that will kill over 90% of us.
[00:50:56.206 --> 00:50:57.607]  They're just getting us ready to kill us.
[00:50:57.607 --> 00:50:58.267]  I hope you know that.
[00:51:00.706 --> 00:51:04.508]  Right now, the average family spends one-fourth of their income on food.

[00:54:11.632 --> 00:54:17.780]  Just incredible developments dealing with the Bilderberg Group and Mitt Romney and the Washington Post admitting it.
[00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:19.703]  A bunch of big news on earthquakes.
[00:54:21.357 --> 00:54:22.519]  Is it tied to fracking?
[00:54:22.519 --> 00:54:27.686]  Is it underground railways being built causing all those big booms and earthquakes in Wisconsin?
[00:54:27.686 --> 00:54:28.627]  That is all coming up.
[00:54:28.627 --> 00:54:31.691]  A special report on that front, but open phones today.

[00:55:37.233 --> 00:55:40.135]  The name in gravity filtration systems.
[00:55:40.135 --> 00:55:42.716]  Let's talk to KJ in Georgia.
[00:55:42.716 --> 00:55:43.396]  You're on the air.
[00:55:43.396 --> 00:55:44.037]  Thank you for holding.
[00:55:45.197 --> 00:55:48.498]  Alex, this is KJ coming at you from FEMA Sector 4.
[00:55:48.498 --> 00:55:49.338]  How are you today, sir?
[00:55:49.338 --> 00:55:49.698]  Good.
[00:55:49.698 --> 00:55:52.779]  Alex Jones from FEMA Sector 6.
[00:55:52.779 --> 00:56:01.001]  Alex, I'm calling you because down here, myself and my fellow Info Warriors, we're launching a massive offensive against the New World Order on Sunday, April 15th.
[00:56:01.001 --> 00:56:02.321]  Good.
[00:56:02.321 --> 00:56:05.302]  Our target is the NDAA and Senator Chip Rogers.
[00:56:05.302 --> 00:56:07.263]  He's our state senator from our district.
[00:56:07.263 --> 00:56:08.523]  He's having a town hall meeting
[00:56:09.415 --> 00:56:13.497]  At the Woodstock Public Library on Sunday, April 15th at 2 o'clock.
[00:56:13.497 --> 00:56:18.220]  And I'm calling to get this message out to all the fellow April Wars out there who are kind of local.
[00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:20.201]  Hopefully you can come out and join us.
[00:56:20.201 --> 00:56:34.228]  So basically, Senator Chip Rogers, like every other GOP senator in red states and really across the country, he's faced with a big upswell of liberty-minded folks who are in the GOP who are really changing the complexion of the party.
[00:56:34.228 --> 00:56:38.890]  And so he has been busy trying to co-opt that movement while still trying to play patty cakes
[00:56:39.622 --> 00:56:42.405]  And you know, keep doing the hokey pokey with the establishment.
[00:56:42.405 --> 00:56:46.909]  Now, so far he's been paying us a lot of lip service, he's been patting us on the head, shaking our hands.
[00:56:46.909 --> 00:56:51.713]  I've been going to these town hall meetings, but he hasn't really been introducing any great legislation.
[00:56:51.713 --> 00:56:55.457]  I'll give you an example of some of the legislation he introduced this year that he has on his website bragging about.
[00:56:56.149 --> 00:56:58.791]  He did introduce NASCAR license plates.
[00:56:58.791 --> 00:57:00.972]  Now we can have NASCAR license plates in Georgia.
[00:57:00.972 --> 00:57:02.833]  So, you know, we're very happy about those.
[00:57:02.833 --> 00:57:05.214]  And he also introduced an internet sales tax.
[00:57:05.214 --> 00:57:09.037]  He didn't introduce that, I'm sorry, but he voted for it and he did support it.
[00:57:09.037 --> 00:57:10.477]  It passed out of his Senate.
[00:57:10.477 --> 00:57:13.099]  And now also we're going to pay a tax on used car sales.
[00:57:13.099 --> 00:57:16.301]  So private used car sales are going to be taxed here in Georgia.
[00:57:16.301 --> 00:57:18.962]  So we've got some great things, great victories for Liberty.
[00:57:18.962 --> 00:57:19.923]  Of course, I'm being facetious.
[00:57:20.825 --> 00:57:24.086]  Look, right now I've got a group of probably about 25 people strong.
[00:57:24.086 --> 00:57:27.427]  We're going to go out to this town hall meeting and we're really going to make our presence felt.
[00:57:27.427 --> 00:57:28.528]  We're going to demand... Good!
[00:57:28.528 --> 00:57:30.668]  And everybody else needs to do similar things.
[00:57:30.668 --> 00:57:31.409]  Good to hear from you.
[00:57:31.409 --> 00:57:33.129]  Great job, KJ.
[00:57:33.129 --> 00:57:34.830]  Let's jam in another one here.
[00:57:34.830 --> 00:57:37.111]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in New York.
[00:57:37.111 --> 00:57:37.951]  Mike, you're on the air.
[00:57:37.951 --> 00:57:42.553]  Alex, I'm so glad you take this call.
[00:57:42.553 --> 00:57:46.674]  I tried to call earlier in the week about your Easter agenda.
[00:57:47.546 --> 00:57:51.611]  But this is a call out of necessity, uh, before I get to that.
[00:57:51.611 --> 00:58:05.426]  I just, uh, mentioned, uh, maybe your friend Charlie Sheen, uh, you've heard of, uh, of a movie, 1988, uh, The Last Temptation of Christ, uh, Willem Dafoe?
[00:58:05.426 --> 00:58:06.748]  Yeah, it's a work of fiction, yeah.
[00:58:07.935 --> 00:58:09.756]  Work of Fiction, maybe.
[00:58:09.756 --> 00:58:10.196]  Yeah.
[00:58:10.196 --> 00:58:11.216]  It's a powerful movie.
[00:58:11.216 --> 00:58:14.457]  And again, I've known Charlie Sheen for about eight years.
[00:58:14.457 --> 00:58:18.139]  I don't endorse some of the problems he's had, but he's a good guy at heart.
[00:58:18.139 --> 00:58:22.840]  Specifically, what's going on with Charlie Sheen?
[00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:24.961]  Nothing more about Charlie Sheen.
[00:58:24.961 --> 00:58:26.501]  It's my own predicament.
[00:58:26.501 --> 00:58:28.082]  It started a couple years ago.
[00:58:28.082 --> 00:58:31.263]  A problem with gardening.
[00:58:31.263 --> 00:58:32.563]  I grown my own vegetable garden.
[00:58:32.563 --> 00:58:36.005]  Wait a minute, you're not one of those Americans that thinks you can have a garden.
[00:58:36.005 --> 00:58:36.225]  Whoa!
[00:58:37.626 --> 00:58:43.318]  Whoa, stay there!
[00:58:43.318 --> 00:58:47.306]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.575 --> 00:58:55.138]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:55.138 --> 00:58:56.058]  Number one.
[00:58:56.058 --> 00:58:59.481]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:59.481 --> 00:59:00.341]  Number two.
[00:59:00.341 --> 00:59:05.224]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:05.224 --> 00:59:05.965]  It's true.
[00:59:05.965 --> 00:59:10.848]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:10.848 --> 00:59:11.668]  Number three.
[00:59:11.668 --> 00:59:15.251]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:15.251 --> 00:59:18.953]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:19.153 --> 00:59:19.954]  Number 4.
[00:59:19.954 --> 00:59:22.716]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.716 --> 00:59:26.398]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:26.398 --> 00:59:27.179]  Number 5.
[00:59:27.179 --> 00:59:31.322]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:31.322 --> 00:59:36.085]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:36.385 --> 00:59:40.549]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:42.330]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:42.330 --> 00:59:44.593]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:59:44.593 --> 00:59:47.195]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:59:47.195 --> 00:59:48.576]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:48.576 --> 00:59:54.502]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.359 --> 01:00:10.201]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.201 --> 01:00:11.782]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.782 --> 01:00:13.323]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.323 --> 01:00:17.525]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.525 --> 01:00:21.587]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.451 --> 01:00:32.174]  All right, we're into our number two here.
[01:00:32.174 --> 01:00:33.855]  Wide open telephones coming up.
[01:00:33.855 --> 01:00:38.178]  Washington Post suggests Bilderberg Group to pick Romney's running mate.
[01:00:38.178 --> 01:00:43.822]  What does that signify in the media that they're going that public after telling their readers it didn't exist for decades?
[01:00:43.822 --> 01:00:47.104]  I guess their deceptions don't work anymore, hmm?
[01:00:47.104 --> 01:00:48.565]  Too little, too late.
[01:00:48.565 --> 01:00:56.711]  Right-wing group slams HBO's Angry Boys for sexualizing children with girl sucking on bleep cup.
[01:00:58.715 --> 01:01:05.708]  I mean, and then the media's like, oh, those right-wingers, they don't like, you know, a six-year-old kid doing sexual acts on TV.
[01:01:05.708 --> 01:01:07.190]  Oh, they're so squares!
[01:01:11.488 --> 01:01:14.429]  Oh, there's such squares, they're not into mutilation.
[01:01:14.429 --> 01:01:16.889]  Oh, there's such squares, they're not into being amputees.
[01:01:16.889 --> 01:01:25.912]  People are into having their arms and legs chopped off now, and the really trendy ones get both arms and legs chopped off, then live in a box, and you wear a diaper as an adult with your arms and legs chopped off.
[01:01:25.912 --> 01:01:27.132]  Thousands have it in the U.S.
[01:01:27.132 --> 01:01:30.673]  It's the ultimate in trendiness.
[01:01:30.673 --> 01:01:36.875]  And they told the Chinese emperors, they said, you are royal, you have to stay in this forbidden city.
[01:01:38.092 --> 01:01:39.152]  Next, your feet.
[01:01:39.152 --> 01:01:41.973]  It's very beautiful and vain to have small feet.
[01:01:41.973 --> 01:01:44.053]  Let us bind them so you can't walk.
[01:01:44.053 --> 01:01:45.254]  And we must feed you.
[01:01:45.254 --> 01:01:48.734]  You have to have long fingernails.
[01:01:48.734 --> 01:01:53.055]  And then they just became addled prisoners of the ruling class bureaucracy.
[01:01:53.055 --> 01:01:53.755]  And that's what they do now.
[01:01:53.755 --> 01:01:59.277]  They just tell women, you know, hey, you got to throw the men out of your house and hate them.
[01:01:59.277 --> 01:01:59.597]  It's trending.
[01:01:59.597 --> 01:02:03.517]  They're like, let's do it.
[01:02:03.517 --> 01:02:05.398]  And they come out and say, chop your arms and legs off.
[01:02:06.613 --> 01:02:10.396]  Of course they have lesser degrees of it, it's true.
[01:02:18.377 --> 01:02:19.478]  It's a big thing now.
[01:02:19.478 --> 01:02:21.840]  They made a film about it a few years ago to get shot.
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:26.104]  So you go to the artist and via free association, people are allowed to do it.
[01:02:26.104 --> 01:02:33.911]  And then they'll put like a 45 or 38, 37 up under your arm and then shoot you.
[01:02:33.911 --> 01:02:38.756]  So you've got a big splatter wound in the back to look, you know, really tough when you're at the pool, man.
[01:02:41.727 --> 01:02:47.230]  Also, women are getting scars on their faces now to just show how tough they are.
[01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:49.651]  Just how into death they are.
[01:02:49.651 --> 01:02:50.911]  Don't worry.
[01:02:50.911 --> 01:02:53.953]  That's all just the preparation for the bioweapons to be released.
[01:02:53.953 --> 01:02:55.854]  You'll be dead enough soon.
[01:02:55.854 --> 01:02:58.215]  You'll be a rotting skull that you think's so beautiful.
[01:02:58.215 --> 01:03:00.156]  You'll get what you want, probably.
[01:03:00.156 --> 01:03:01.316]  I'll go back to Mike in New York.
[01:03:01.316 --> 01:03:04.498]  Mike, what was your point here in the two minutes we've got left?
[01:03:04.498 --> 01:03:06.699]  What was the point you were raising about an evil garden?
[01:03:07.708 --> 01:03:12.650]  Talking about your point, Alex, don't you know it's called Naughty America?
[01:03:12.650 --> 01:03:31.277]  I mean, it's the biggest porn production, and the hype on, you know, sweet lips, and this is okay, and it's great, and it's glamorous, and trying to attract young fellows and young gals into the industry, but I'm... What happened to your evil garden?
[01:03:31.277 --> 01:03:35.639]  The evil garden, two years ago, neighbors moved in and out next door,
[01:03:36.323 --> 01:03:40.887]  And they take down the fences, put up the fences, and the woods is close by.
[01:03:40.887 --> 01:03:47.193]  So, uh, woodchucks in particular are invading our property, our residential area.
[01:03:47.193 --> 01:03:51.717]  Okay, uh, one half acre lots and so on and so forth.
[01:03:51.717 --> 01:03:57.382]  And, uh, I'm growing all my vegetables, uh, you know, in pots, raised pots.
[01:03:57.382 --> 01:04:01.085]  So you're not allowed, let me guess, you're not allowed to kill the Hully woodchucks?
[01:04:01.590 --> 01:04:08.294]  Well, we tried every way we could to capture them, with the have-a-heart traps and so on and so forth.
[01:04:08.294 --> 01:04:09.895]  Just use a high-powered pellet gun.
[01:04:09.895 --> 01:04:11.616]  Your pea-brained neighbors will never know.
[01:04:11.616 --> 01:04:12.877]  So what happened?
[01:04:12.877 --> 01:04:17.059]  Okay, so yeah, I thought about that and stuff, but first we called the law.
[01:04:17.059 --> 01:04:23.583]  And when, you know, a raccoon is sitting out on a Sunday afternoon, 11 o'clock in the morning... See, I mean, you gotta call the police.
[01:04:23.583 --> 01:04:24.384]  That's what they've done.
[01:04:24.384 --> 01:04:27.185]  You gotta call the police for a raccoon?
[01:04:27.185 --> 01:04:29.487]  You gotta, you gotta follow law.
[01:04:31.505 --> 01:04:33.326]  That's what they got us trained to do.
[01:04:33.326 --> 01:04:37.547]  So anyways, a police officer comes out, who I've known.
[01:04:37.547 --> 01:04:38.888]  I went to elementary school with him.
[01:04:38.888 --> 01:04:41.789]  Okay, listen, I gotta hear the end of the story, but you got one minute on the other side.
[01:04:41.789 --> 01:04:48.031]  I gotta hear about, you call the police for a raccoon.
[01:04:48.031 --> 01:04:52.093]  You know, you can build a very inexpensive silencer for a 410 shotgun.
[01:04:52.093 --> 01:04:54.093]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:54.093 --> 01:04:55.294]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05:01.789 --> 01:05:03.530]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.

[01:05:27.425 --> 01:05:35.428]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:05:35.428 --> 01:05:40.650]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[01:06:57.281 --> 01:07:07.534]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good sized meal, I was still starving.
[01:07:07.534 --> 01:07:09.817]  And my research led me to a well-known fact.
[01:07:10.057 --> 01:07:25.386]  That most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:07:25.386 --> 01:07:31.589]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Youngevity.
[01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:39.394]  The Youngevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[01:07:39.734 --> 01:07:46.036]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[01:07:46.036 --> 01:07:47.316]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:07:47.316 --> 01:07:48.196]  It's incredible.

[01:07:57.399 --> 01:08:01.820]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:04.601]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.601 --> 01:08:07.422]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:13.604 --> 01:08:18.067]  Okay, we're gonna finish up with Mike here, a caller, he just joined us.
[01:08:18.067 --> 01:08:21.449]  He's calling us from somewhere in New York.
[01:08:21.449 --> 01:08:28.873]  And they have woodchucks, raccoons invading their property and I guess the police are saying you're not allowed to do anything to them.
[01:08:28.873 --> 01:08:33.696]  I've seen cases in New York, in the country, in a rural area.
[01:08:33.696 --> 01:08:38.739]  Remember like 15 years ago the guy, he got arrested for killing a rat?
[01:08:40.581 --> 01:08:48.264]  And then it was such a big deal that he killed a rat that neighbors called the police on him and he went to jail for animal cruelty.
[01:08:48.264 --> 01:08:54.266]  Now remember, you can buy Decon rat killer all day, but he was arrested.
[01:08:54.266 --> 01:08:58.427]  Again, there's no law, you've got to take a vaccine, but more and more they're taking your kids.
[01:08:58.427 --> 01:09:00.448]  It's a lawlessness.
[01:09:00.448 --> 01:09:07.210]  So if you've got raccoons invading and getting in your trash can or eating your backyard garden,
[01:09:08.502 --> 01:09:11.903]  Just get a high-powered pellet gun and start shooting!
[01:09:11.903 --> 01:09:14.223]  I mean, that's what I'd do.
[01:09:14.223 --> 01:09:15.924]  I was joking about building a silencer.
[01:09:15.924 --> 01:09:16.884]  That's illegal.
[01:09:16.884 --> 01:09:23.046]  But they do have primitive silencers that you can use, you know, on a shotgun or something if you don't want to bother your neighbors.
[01:09:23.046 --> 01:09:26.546]  But obviously don't use a shotgun in the city.
[01:09:26.546 --> 01:09:34.628]  I mean, I've got a friend out in the country and he's got a line of tires out in front of his little shooting bench.
[01:09:34.628 --> 01:09:35.409]  He lives in the country.
[01:09:35.409 --> 01:09:36.789]  He can shoot, you know, all day if he wants.
[01:09:37.924 --> 01:09:40.965]  But he doesn't like to bug his neighbors that are, you know, 10 acres over.
[01:09:40.965 --> 01:09:50.129]  When he's shooting high caliber, you know, guns that are really noisy and for a long time, he shoots through the barrels at the target.
[01:09:50.129 --> 01:09:56.852]  And so look at the scope, you don't even see the barrels around it, but it just dissipates the audio to an incredible level.
[01:09:56.852 --> 01:10:07.396]  In fact, my dad was out there at the mutual friend's house just a few months ago shooting and just said it was amazing that it was such a, but again, I digress with a factoid there.
[01:10:09.022 --> 01:10:18.431]  I mean, look, a Daisy Red Rider that costs like 50 bucks, my children have got those, and they're incredibly accurate.
[01:10:18.431 --> 01:10:22.235]  Like, I felt kind of bad the other day across the creek.
[01:10:22.235 --> 01:10:25.678]  It's about from my porch to across the little creek.
[01:10:25.678 --> 01:10:33.866]  It's probably about 50 yards, and there was a bird sitting up in a tree, and I was shooting, showing my son.
[01:10:35.868 --> 01:10:39.769]  You know, that he could shoot things that far away with it, but how to elevate?
[01:10:39.769 --> 01:10:43.311]  And I just knocked that bird right off its perch and killed it.
[01:10:43.311 --> 01:10:45.071]  I wasn't even trying to kill it.
[01:10:45.071 --> 01:10:48.453]  I was just trying to shoot in its general direction to make it fly.
[01:10:48.453 --> 01:10:55.055]  But a Red Rider single pump will deal, won't kill it, probably won't even pierce the skin, the raccoon.
[01:10:55.055 --> 01:10:57.376]  You start lighting them up with that, they're not going to come around.
[01:10:57.376 --> 01:11:02.398]  You know, if you have fish ponds, and they're coming in and eating your fish, it's time
[01:11:03.763 --> 01:11:10.637]  I mean my parents have them invading their house if they forget and don't close the dog door for their French Bulldog.
[01:11:13.769 --> 01:11:19.891]  My dad nicely goes in with a broom, and one time he had like, I think, 14 of them in the house.
[01:11:19.891 --> 01:11:20.951]  Raccoons are really smart.
[01:11:20.951 --> 01:11:24.053]  And I said, listen, dad, you gotta start shooting them with a pellet gun.
[01:11:24.053 --> 01:11:25.413]  They think they run everything.
[01:11:25.413 --> 01:11:29.915]  You pull up, you walk up, sometimes as it's getting dark, you see coons on the roof looking at you.
[01:11:29.915 --> 01:11:32.996]  My dad's like, oh, I kind of like them, I'll just restock the pond.
[01:11:32.996 --> 01:11:36.537]  So there's coons waiting around eating all his fish.
[01:11:36.537 --> 01:11:39.438]  That's why mountain lions eat people out in California, not in other states.
[01:11:40.933 --> 01:11:43.895]  Because in other states they're hiding because they know you'll shoot them.
[01:11:43.895 --> 01:11:45.415]  Same thing with wolves or coyotes.
[01:11:45.415 --> 01:11:51.659]  Now coyotes are coming into built-up areas and for the first time in over a hundred years are killing people.
[01:11:51.659 --> 01:11:52.839]  It's always the same.
[01:11:52.839 --> 01:11:55.521]  A woman is walking at the park, runs, falls.
[01:11:55.521 --> 01:11:58.422]  Five coyotes chew her throat out.
[01:11:58.422 --> 01:12:03.405]  If you wouldn't have run from them, they wouldn't have thought you were a prey animal.
[01:12:03.405 --> 01:12:04.386]  We got mountain lions here.
[01:12:05.683 --> 01:12:11.765]  It was in one of the local papers just a few months ago that somebody had one of those deer feeder cameras out, motion cameras.
[01:12:11.765 --> 01:12:13.545]  And there was that big old mountain lion.
[01:12:13.545 --> 01:12:14.966]  We got big ones around here.
[01:12:14.966 --> 01:12:16.886]  Those things are so scared of humans, and they should be.
[01:12:16.886 --> 01:12:20.987]  Because if I see one in my backyard, I'm going to shoot it.
[01:12:20.987 --> 01:12:29.430]  Because if I don't, they will kill my little children that look like juicy, delectable treats to them.
[01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:32.871]  They need to learn that we're the dominant species.
[01:12:34.241 --> 01:12:37.582]  They're like roaches and they're beautiful animals, but they're all over the place.
[01:12:37.582 --> 01:12:42.123]  They're not letting people kill polar bears up in Canada and Alaska in many areas.
[01:12:42.123 --> 01:12:43.343]  So they're now starting to kill people.
[01:12:43.343 --> 01:12:45.104]  They're coming into the towns.
[01:12:45.104 --> 01:12:46.964]  They're starting to come further and further south.
[01:12:46.964 --> 01:12:49.765]  Their numbers are up conservatively threefold.
[01:12:49.765 --> 01:12:51.305]  Some estimates are fivefold.
[01:12:51.305 --> 01:12:52.065]  I'm now digressing.
[01:12:52.065 --> 01:12:53.426]  I've got to move quicker to calls.
[01:12:53.426 --> 01:12:58.387]  Okay, Mike, so long story short, you're supposed to call the police when the raccoons are assaulting you.
[01:12:58.387 --> 01:13:00.948]  Sounds like you live in a suburb, quasi-rural area.
[01:13:00.948 --> 01:13:01.728]  Tell us where you live.
[01:13:01.728 --> 01:13:02.308]  Finish the story.
[01:13:03.004 --> 01:13:07.507]  Orange County, New York, and you're kind of on the right track.
[01:13:07.507 --> 01:13:14.271]  A friend, a police officer comes out, and you know, we tell him about the story and stuff, and you know what he recommends?
[01:13:14.271 --> 01:13:16.653]  Something you didn't discuss, but a CB-22.
[01:13:16.653 --> 01:13:26.399]  And come to find out, it's totally legal, because there's no gunpowder in it, it's just primer, and it doesn't exceed 700 feet per second.
[01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:45.777]  Which is coming up in the trial and you know the ironic thing about this is this cop I'm so angry at is that he came up and lied that he didn't have any idea what I was talking about he didn't recall the incident so on and so forth to save his butt so to speak anyways
[01:13:46.437 --> 01:13:49.618]  The story involves how I got arrested.
[01:13:49.618 --> 01:13:51.799]  I killed probably 30 woodchucks.
[01:13:51.799 --> 01:13:55.120]  Took two shots, typically.
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:14:04.802]  But on this one afternoon, the same neighbor that was there, while this officer instructed me and said, why don't you just shoot them, Mike?
[01:14:04.802 --> 01:14:05.943]  You're a good shot, aren't you?
[01:14:05.943 --> 01:14:07.923]  I said, of course, Pete.
[01:14:07.923 --> 01:14:10.584]  How did you get arrested for shooting stupid woodchucks?
[01:14:11.314 --> 01:14:13.836]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:14:13.836 --> 01:14:16.418]  The neighbor got mad after a 12-hour workday.
[01:14:16.418 --> 01:14:22.003]  I was working around my house at 7 o'clock in the evening, and I see this woodchuck up here, so I shoot him.
[01:14:22.003 --> 01:14:23.164]  And I got him right in the head.
[01:14:23.164 --> 01:14:23.625]  I know.
[01:14:23.625 --> 01:14:24.485]  I come outside.
[01:14:24.485 --> 01:14:28.349]  I said, Jim, my next-door neighbor, did you see the woodchuck?
[01:14:28.349 --> 01:14:29.590]  He says, what?
[01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:32.092]  He says, I just shot a woodchuck.
[01:14:32.092 --> 01:14:35.755]  He says, you promised never to shoot it when my kids were at home.
[01:14:35.755 --> 01:14:37.397]  I said, what are you talking about?
[01:14:37.397 --> 01:14:38.798]  And he promptly went inside.
[01:14:40.209 --> 01:14:40.830]  I don't know.
[01:14:57.023 --> 01:15:01.787]  Shoot a deer, or in one case a guy ran over one and thought, well, I just killed it, I'll go butcher it.
[01:15:01.787 --> 01:15:03.528]  Which actually makes a lot of sense.
[01:15:03.528 --> 01:15:06.050]  In some areas they take the fresh roadkill and feed it to the homeless.
[01:15:06.050 --> 01:15:07.791]  It's good meat.
[01:15:07.791 --> 01:15:11.874]  And now if people see you butchering a deer, they call the police.
[01:15:11.874 --> 01:15:15.436]  And even though it's not illegal, they arrest you and say it's disturbing the peace.
[01:15:15.436 --> 01:15:18.338]  These idiots go to the store, buy meat.
[01:15:18.338 --> 01:15:20.780]  Again, I saw this a few years ago.
[01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:22.762]  I was out fishing and I was at the boat dock.
[01:15:23.752 --> 01:15:32.618]  I'd come back from fishing, back when I had a little time to do such things, and there was a fisherman there cutting up a bunch of catfish and bass, and he had an electric knife.
[01:15:32.618 --> 01:15:39.842]  And I saw these trendies go by, I guess down to the sailboat area, and they were like, oh my gosh, he's cutting fish up!
[01:15:39.842 --> 01:15:41.543]  I mean, they're so domesticated.
[01:15:41.543 --> 01:15:43.544]  They don't know where electricity comes from.
[01:15:43.544 --> 01:15:47.347]  They don't know where the meat in the store with a saran wrap on it comes from.
[01:15:49.668 --> 01:15:55.290]  I've seen cases where people have seen their neighbor skinning squirrels, they went and shot legally.
[01:15:55.290 --> 01:15:57.470]  And then they call the police on them, calling it animal cruelty.
[01:15:57.470 --> 01:16:11.595]  I mean, I remember my grandpa routinely would walk out in the backyard, shoot a squirrel, skin it in about a minute, and go in and cook it as a little side dish to what my grandma would make.
[01:16:11.595 --> 01:16:14.876]  And to the average person, that is weird.
[01:16:17.349 --> 01:16:24.110]  To the average person, it is weird and like abusive to have deer hanging up.
[01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:26.511]  I mean, that's what humans do.
[01:16:26.511 --> 01:16:29.991]  We'd be a lot healthier if we actually did hunt and butcher stuff ourselves.
[01:16:29.991 --> 01:16:32.072]  These people are crazy.
[01:16:32.072 --> 01:16:34.172]  They're crazy.
[01:16:34.172 --> 01:16:36.332]  Raccoon pot roast?
[01:16:36.332 --> 01:16:37.433]  I don't think that would be too good.
[01:16:37.433 --> 01:16:39.973]  Talk about gamey.
[01:16:39.973 --> 01:16:45.194]  But I'll tell you, in the Great Depression, even middle class people had to... there sometimes wasn't even meat at the store.
[01:16:45.956 --> 01:16:56.146]  Or you couldn't afford it, and there were almost no raccoons, possums, or deer left in East Texas, where my dad's family's from, at the end of the Depression.
[01:16:56.146 --> 01:16:57.047]  Because they'd eaten them.
[01:17:00.123 --> 01:17:09.392]  And I'm like some barbarian creature, and I'm not even good at chopping up a deer perfectly like my dad or my uncle can do.
[01:17:09.392 --> 01:17:13.496]  I mean, I know how to do it because I've done it a few times, but it's kind of like you just let your kid be lazy.
[01:17:13.496 --> 01:17:15.277]  Like, Alex, you shot three deer today?
[01:17:15.277 --> 01:17:17.359]  Well, that's what I could shoot this year, and they all came by.
[01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:34.097]  Okay, you gotta help us and you know halfway into one I like wander off into the cookhouse and my dad's out there field dressing it all and then chopping it all up and side issue Boy, I need to be arrested.
[01:17:34.097 --> 01:17:34.858]  I'm bad.
[01:17:34.858 --> 01:17:38.241]  Let's go ahead and talk to Fred in Wisconsin.
[01:17:38.241 --> 01:17:39.162]  Thanks for holding Fred.
[01:17:39.162 --> 01:17:39.683]  You're on the air
[01:17:41.095 --> 01:17:41.515]  No problem.
[01:17:41.515 --> 01:17:42.376]  Hey, Alex.
[01:17:42.376 --> 01:17:44.797]  It's your friend, the SOPA protester.
[01:17:44.797 --> 01:17:46.598]  We talked a few months ago.
[01:17:46.598 --> 01:17:48.339]  Yes, sir.
[01:17:48.339 --> 01:17:56.603]  The reason I'm calling is, I wanted to know, did you see this video that was released of the autistic child that was shocked 31 times for not removing his coat?
[01:17:57.375 --> 01:18:14.572]  Yeah, in fact, I mentioned it yesterday and people would think that I try to make the system look bad, but most of the time I don't even use the information I've got against the system because I've already looked at it and it's so depressing to watch that
[01:18:16.144 --> 01:18:17.625]  I then don't even play it on the air.
[01:18:17.625 --> 01:18:18.245]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:18:18.245 --> 01:18:20.306]  If I'm guilty of anything, it's holding back.
[01:18:20.306 --> 01:18:24.867]  Guys, will you cue up the video of the autistic child being shocked?
[01:18:24.867 --> 01:18:36.472]  We had it up at InfoWars.com and I'm going to have that reposted there on the site because there is an epidemic of torture and what they call pain compliance.
[01:18:36.472 --> 01:18:38.773]  And so we'll play that after the break, but give us your take on that.
[01:18:40.097 --> 01:18:52.583]  Well, you know, I watched this, and this is because he wouldn't remove his coat, and all I could think was, this is my brother, this is my sister, they'd be lucky if they got this guy in court before I got to him.
[01:18:52.583 --> 01:18:54.484]  Because it made me so angry.
[01:18:54.484 --> 01:19:00.587]  I mean, 31 times, this is torture, and the kid's autistic, you know, so they bring him to the hospital.
[01:19:00.587 --> 01:19:03.209]  No, no, no, torture is now legal.
[01:19:03.209 --> 01:19:04.789]  They call it pain compliance.
[01:19:04.789 --> 01:19:06.030]  The courts have ruled.
[01:19:06.030 --> 01:19:07.751]  They can break arms, they can kill you.
[01:19:09.171 --> 01:19:14.712]  And again, it's really illegal, but the crazy scum are just normalizing it.
[01:19:14.712 --> 01:19:16.773]  Do you see what's happening?
[01:19:16.773 --> 01:19:21.034]  They're laughing while they're doing it, and this center is still open.
[01:19:21.034 --> 01:19:24.414]  Why isn't this guy's face on a 2012 poster?
[01:19:24.414 --> 01:19:26.175]  Why isn't this all over the media?
[01:19:26.175 --> 01:19:28.975]  You know, they're covering the story in Florida.
[01:19:28.975 --> 01:19:33.797]  Sir, I've got footage of them breaking protesters' arms now.
[01:19:33.797 --> 01:19:35.357]  They are trained not to break your arm.
[01:19:37.574 --> 01:19:44.000]  I mean, HBO shows little girls engaging in fellatio on television.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.685]  I mean, and then the media says we're bad for not liking it.
[01:19:48.685 --> 01:19:49.486]  Anything else you want to add?
[01:19:50.845 --> 01:19:52.346]  Ah, it's just sick.
[01:19:52.346 --> 01:19:54.207]  It's always fun to hear from you, Alex.
[01:19:54.207 --> 01:19:54.848]  Thank you, sir.
[01:19:54.848 --> 01:19:57.269]  Yeah, we'll actually come back and play a part of that.
[01:19:57.269 --> 01:19:58.130]  Torture.
[01:19:58.130 --> 01:19:58.770]  Well, it's not torture.
[01:19:58.770 --> 01:20:00.071]  It's freedom.
[01:20:00.071 --> 01:20:00.992]  It's freedom.
[01:20:00.992 --> 01:20:08.136]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, I was still starving.
[01:20:08.136 --> 01:20:10.418]  And my research led me to a well-known fact.
[01:20:10.638 --> 01:20:25.853]  That most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:20:25.853 --> 01:20:29.957]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[01:20:30.217 --> 01:20:31.958]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[01:20:31.958 --> 01:20:40.064]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[01:24:06.437 --> 01:24:08.958]  There's a woman in the night.
[01:24:08.958 --> 01:24:13.499]  She's got a baby in her hands.
[01:24:13.499 --> 01:24:18.620]  Yeah, she hates the life.
[01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:25.422]  Yeah, there's one more kid that'll never get to go to school, never get to have a good life, never get to be cool.
[01:24:34.834 --> 01:24:37.237]  You know what blows me away about pain compliance?
[01:24:37.237 --> 01:24:41.360]  They just renamed torture pain compliance.
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:56.114]  And Homeland Security, of course, three years ago had meetings and proposed fitting everyone who gets on an airplane at the airport, at the TSA molestation slave training facility, with a taser bracelet.
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:11.290]  Now already with the masses of brain-damaged and neurologically harmed children, the little dungeons they have for them at the public schools get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.
[01:25:11.290 --> 01:25:18.615]  And so all over the country, they have them fitted with these taser belts and taser bracelets.
[01:25:18.615 --> 01:25:19.976]  And they have the restraint chairs.
[01:25:19.976 --> 01:25:26.201]  And if you don't follow any order they give you, you are tortured, in this case, for seven hours.
[01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:32.131]  And when it's on the news, they're like, it's controversial.
[01:25:32.131 --> 01:25:33.712]  No, it's illegal.
[01:25:33.712 --> 01:25:34.712]  You're just power grabbing.
[01:25:34.712 --> 01:25:36.692]  You're just training us that we have no rights.
[01:25:36.692 --> 01:25:38.493]  You're training us that we're slaves.
[01:25:38.493 --> 01:25:41.594]  You're training us you can do whatever you want.
[01:25:41.594 --> 01:25:47.555]  And I've seen federal and state courts rule police can taser you to make you answer questions or urinate in a cup.
[01:25:47.555 --> 01:25:50.456]  Those are real cases, look them up.
[01:25:50.456 --> 01:25:53.857]  One case they tortured a guy, what was it, eight times to make him answer questions?
[01:25:53.857 --> 01:25:54.857]  What happened to Fifth Amendment?
[01:25:57.106 --> 01:26:00.228]  This is like North Korea, what they're trying to do.
[01:26:00.228 --> 01:26:06.413]  They're trying to have this revolution against our republic and common sense in due process, in the name of safety.
[01:26:06.413 --> 01:26:09.435]  But the greatest danger is a government that acts like this.
[01:26:09.435 --> 01:26:11.417]  And it's happening.
[01:26:11.417 --> 01:26:13.759]  Everything our forebearers warned us of.
[01:26:13.759 --> 01:26:20.264]  And so here's a child being tortured for not taking his coat off, autistic, probably by all the vaccines.
[01:26:20.264 --> 01:26:22.686]  It's mainly boys because their blood-brain barrier isn't as strong.
[01:26:24.226 --> 01:26:26.327]  They don't doubt it's exploding.
[01:26:26.327 --> 01:26:29.009]  They just say, keep taking the shots, everything's fine.
[01:26:29.009 --> 01:26:29.769]  And that's not enough.
[01:26:29.769 --> 01:26:38.935]  Now they're going to taser him over and over and over and over again.
[01:26:38.935 --> 01:26:44.499]  And this is the main lining of it, where we're animals that get cattle prodded if we don't do what we're told.
[01:26:44.499 --> 01:26:47.200]  Police say, license the registration.
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:48.541]  No.
[01:26:48.541 --> 01:26:49.462]  Do it till I tell you.
[01:26:49.462 --> 01:26:50.102]  Give it to me now.
[01:26:50.102 --> 01:26:52.444]  This is what they're telling him to do.
[01:26:53.669 --> 01:26:59.190]  It's about, they're the boss, and now the cops are like, you can't go in the city council building at two o'clock in the afternoon.
[01:26:59.190 --> 01:27:00.330]  It says public building.
[01:27:00.330 --> 01:27:02.171]  I got a gun right here, pal.
[01:27:02.171 --> 01:27:07.452]  Get your InfoWars reporters and get out of here.
[01:27:07.452 --> 01:27:11.632]  Let's go, I mean, this is the essence of tyranny, and they're going to take your bank accounts, devalue your dollar.
[01:27:11.632 --> 01:27:17.493]  See, with all this tyranny, they're setting this tyranny up because they're going to hurt everybody.
[01:27:17.493 --> 01:27:18.253]  You understand?
[01:27:18.253 --> 01:27:20.094]  People are like, oh, I don't care if they're doing that to people.
[01:27:20.094 --> 01:27:20.614]  I ask, so what?
[01:27:21.627 --> 01:27:25.128]  They want to hurt you, too, because they like it.
[01:27:25.128 --> 01:27:27.389]  And a lot of these cops aren't even bad people.
[01:27:27.389 --> 01:27:32.091]  They just believe, well, I'm allowed to taser you for no reason, because I'm in charge.
[01:27:32.091 --> 01:27:35.952]  Let's go ahead and go to part of this local Fox News clip on this report.
[01:27:35.952 --> 01:27:36.832]  Here it is.
[01:27:36.832 --> 01:27:42.174]  The public can see for itself what these controversial electric shocks look like in use.
[01:27:42.174 --> 01:27:49.477]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:27:51.217 --> 01:27:52.397]  Hit pause.
[01:27:52.397 --> 01:27:57.260]  This man is on a rack like they had in dungeons 800 years ago.
[01:27:57.260 --> 01:28:00.922]  It's a little controversial, but you know, it's needed.
[01:28:00.922 --> 01:28:06.786]  Let's cut to a prison school, that's what they are, with a guy on a rack.
[01:28:06.786 --> 01:28:09.427]  And they tortured him for seven hours.
[01:28:09.427 --> 01:28:17.572]  And they just, it's just like, oh, up next, HBO shows six-year-old girls performing fellatio.
[01:28:20.126 --> 01:28:23.989]  Again, it's just all psychological warfare, and they admit it is.
[01:28:23.989 --> 01:28:25.390]  It's just getting you ready.
[01:28:25.390 --> 01:28:29.513]  And now they're like, well, we are actually looking at releasing a bioweapon to kill most people.
[01:28:29.513 --> 01:28:31.915]  And the media's like, maybe it's needed.
[01:28:31.915 --> 01:28:35.258]  If it's trendy, uh, uh.
[01:28:35.258 --> 01:28:38.280]  I mean, again, this is the Twilight Zone-ness.
[01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:40.302]  Go back to it, because the real torture's about to begin.
[01:28:40.302 --> 01:28:40.582]  Go ahead.
[01:28:44.264 --> 01:28:52.554]  Dramatic video of New York teenager Andre McCollins restrained face down, a helmet on his head, screaming for help.
[01:28:52.554 --> 01:28:55.338]  The Judge Rotenberg Center calls it treatment.
[01:28:55.338 --> 01:29:01.765]  That was shot number 16 or 17.
[01:29:06.534 --> 01:29:13.036]  As McCollins' attorney just described, the teenager was shocked 31 times in all that day in 2002.
[01:29:13.036 --> 01:29:16.637]  McCollins is suing the Canton Bay Center, calling it torture.
[01:29:16.637 --> 01:29:22.479]  Lawyers for the center and its clinicians say McCollins needed aversive therapy because he was aggressive.
[01:29:22.479 --> 01:29:23.739]  These are dramatic tapes.
[01:29:23.739 --> 01:29:25.940]  There's no question about that.
[01:29:25.940 --> 01:29:29.641]  But the treatment plan... Alright, we're gonna go to break and come back.
[01:29:29.641 --> 01:29:32.642]  But the point is, this is being done in schools everywhere, not just this facility.
[01:29:33.422 --> 01:29:38.204]  So they tell parents, don't spank your children, don't be in charge when they're little.
[01:29:38.204 --> 01:29:41.545]  So then they're out of control, well now you put them in torture chairs.
[01:29:41.545 --> 01:29:43.545]  See how they do this?
[01:29:43.545 --> 01:29:48.067]  The state says, don't spank your child and we'll take them, but we're going to shock them.
[01:29:48.067 --> 01:29:49.107]  See how that works?
[01:29:49.107 --> 01:29:50.188]  Be right back.
[01:29:50.188 --> 01:29:51.588]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.588 --> 01:29:54.109]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.109 --> 01:29:56.770]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:03.562]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:03.562 --> 01:30:08.868]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:30:08.868 --> 01:30:10.409]  Saving means to make money.
[01:30:10.409 --> 01:30:19.199]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:30:19.939 --> 01:30:27.464]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:30:27.464 --> 01:30:35.469]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:30:35.469 --> 01:30:40.692]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:30:40.692 --> 01:30:42.873]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[01:31:00.523 --> 01:31:01.845]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:01.845 --> 01:31:07.433]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:31:07.433 --> 01:31:12.459]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:31:12.459 --> 01:31:17.486]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:31:18.007 --> 01:31:23.231]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:31:23.231 --> 01:31:25.553]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:31:25.553 --> 01:31:30.357]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:31:30.357 --> 01:31:31.478]  And here's the best part.
[01:31:31.478 --> 01:31:34.540]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:31:34.540 --> 01:31:37.843]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:31:38.163 --> 01:31:41.344]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:31:41.344 --> 01:31:43.565]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:31:43.565 --> 01:31:44.506]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:31:44.506 --> 01:31:44.906]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:31:44.906 --> 01:31:48.147]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:31:48.147 --> 01:31:49.908]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:01.192 --> 01:32:16.665]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:32:16.665 --> 01:32:20.348]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:21.351 --> 01:32:34.103]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:32:34.103 --> 01:32:41.390]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:32:42.071 --> 01:32:52.439]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:32:52.439 --> 01:32:56.361]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:32:56.361 --> 01:32:59.484]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[01:33:12.665 --> 01:33:15.146]  No, it's not America.
[01:33:15.146 --> 01:33:23.310]  When all over the country, citizens are arrested for videotaping police in public.
[01:33:23.310 --> 01:33:28.292]  And kept, juries are finding them guilty.
[01:33:28.292 --> 01:33:31.233]  And sending them to prison.
[01:33:31.233 --> 01:33:38.436]  We die for the system.
[01:33:38.436 --> 01:33:39.957]  They know what they're doing.
[01:33:43.183 --> 01:33:46.724]  And they're doing it in our face.
[01:33:46.724 --> 01:33:47.705]  Just like yesterday.
[01:33:47.705 --> 01:33:49.565]  By the way, have you talked to McBrain?
[01:33:49.565 --> 01:33:51.206]  Are we going to get an update from them in the third hour?
[01:33:51.206 --> 01:33:53.707]  Chris?
[01:33:53.707 --> 01:33:57.208]  Because as I announced yesterday, we're going to have them back on the show today.
[01:33:58.263 --> 01:34:03.526]  So when I said we're not having guests, that's not really entirely completely true.
[01:34:03.526 --> 01:34:24.919]  We announced on the radio yesterday we'll get another update from them and on the Nightly News and of course on Monday here in studio up there in Georgia where the gentleman kept beating them in court dealing with the chickens that he had on his little farm.
[01:34:24.919 --> 01:34:26.500]  But they showed him he's dead now.
[01:34:29.193 --> 01:34:43.887]  And when our crew got there and tried to go on the city council, the police pulled up and acted like they were criminals and said, turn your cameras off and said, you're not allowed in there.
[01:34:43.887 --> 01:34:48.291]  And of course, we could have forced the issue and gone in and then heaven knows what would have happened.
[01:34:48.291 --> 01:34:53.116]  Because here are a couple articles speaking of tasering children, Georgia Mansus,
[01:34:55.891 --> 01:34:56.972]  The police.
[01:34:56.972 --> 01:34:57.652]  Here's another one.
[01:34:57.652 --> 01:35:01.854]  Georgia man says autistic son tasered.
[01:35:01.854 --> 01:35:06.916]  They also then charged the guy with a whole bunch of felonies, but a jury did not convict him.
[01:35:06.916 --> 01:35:13.339]  A Georgia father said Monday that he was outraged over police use of a taser against his son.
[01:35:13.339 --> 01:35:19.502]  The man said the son suffers from autism and officers knew it.
[01:35:19.502 --> 01:35:20.963]  Another one of the vaccine damaged.
[01:35:22.483 --> 01:35:25.485]  Well, see, the problem is that the vaccine didn't kill him.
[01:35:25.485 --> 01:35:27.466]  I mean, that's the problem.
[01:35:27.466 --> 01:35:28.887]  So he's got to be tasered.
[01:35:28.887 --> 01:35:31.088]  The incident was captured on a police dash cam video.
[01:35:31.088 --> 01:35:36.851]  The video was presented in a Cherokee County courtroom.
[01:35:36.851 --> 01:35:37.872]  His son, J.D.
[01:35:37.872 --> 01:35:43.915]  Moran, said multiple officers surrounded him, cuffed him to the ground, and then tasered him.
[01:35:43.915 --> 01:35:46.837]  Well, yeah, like, the person's not resisting?
[01:35:46.837 --> 01:35:47.757]  He's leaving?
[01:35:47.757 --> 01:35:50.139]  They want to show him he shouldn't have said something to John Kerry?
[01:35:51.562 --> 01:35:55.085]  And so he's got his hands there, up, like, why are you doing this?
[01:35:55.085 --> 01:35:56.327]  Why did you tackle me?
[01:35:56.327 --> 01:35:57.568]  Why are you grabbing me?
[01:35:57.568 --> 01:35:59.349]  And he just says, don't taser me, bro.
[01:35:59.349 --> 01:36:02.392]  And they're like, we're going to.
[01:36:02.392 --> 01:36:03.994]  This is our power.
[01:36:03.994 --> 01:36:07.157]  The globalists put cancer viruses in our shots and fluoride in our water.
[01:36:07.157 --> 01:36:09.059]  They like killing us and we like killing you.
[01:36:09.059 --> 01:36:11.021]  Now have some voltage.
[01:36:11.021 --> 01:36:14.244]  And because tasers aren't killing enough people, they've upped the power.
[01:36:14.244 --> 01:36:15.305]  And they say they're going to up it again.
[01:36:16.254 --> 01:36:21.897]  They're just going to be upping it and upping it to like, yeah, you die sometimes if we do it, but you want to take that risk?
[01:36:21.897 --> 01:36:24.958]  Do what we say.
[01:36:24.958 --> 01:36:26.819]  Do what we say.
[01:36:26.819 --> 01:36:32.982]  And as society degenerates, it's not just the police that are degenerating, it's everything.
[01:36:32.982 --> 01:36:35.223]  It's going to get crazier and crazier.
[01:36:43.012 --> 01:36:52.418]  And it's on the tape that they tackled him, jumped on him, he had the handcuffs already on, and then they charged him with resisting, because they wanted Tasering to show him a little lesson.
[01:36:52.418 --> 01:36:57.342]  And then it's like, oh, and you assaulted us, we're gonna put some felonies on you, but the video doesn't show that.
[01:36:57.342 --> 01:37:08.770]  So they're like, ooh, gee, I wish that Taser was maybe five times more powerful, then there wouldn't need to be a trial, would there?
[01:37:08.770 --> 01:37:11.872]  But hey, there's people above you that like to kill too, don't worry.
[01:37:12.674 --> 01:37:18.556]  And they are.
[01:37:18.556 --> 01:37:19.476]  It goes on.
[01:37:19.476 --> 01:37:23.257]  Parents of autistic boy who was tasered questioned police actions.
[01:37:23.257 --> 01:37:23.837]  Here's another one.
[01:37:23.837 --> 01:37:32.059]  Twelve-year-old autistic boy was shot last month with a police stun gun at the Hawthorne Middle School.
[01:37:32.059 --> 01:37:33.760]  Accused police officials.
[01:37:35.006 --> 01:37:48.652]  I serve as official's kings on Monday of removing their son from school in handcuffs days after the incident and subjecting him to interrogation and retaliation for a misconduct complaint the family had filed.
[01:37:48.652 --> 01:37:49.933]  On top of now the tasering.
[01:37:49.933 --> 01:37:52.254]  Alright, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:37:52.254 --> 01:37:53.654]  I got a bunch of news I will get to.
[01:37:53.654 --> 01:38:00.938]  Let's go ahead and go to Smedley, I love that name, in Montana.
[01:38:00.938 --> 01:38:01.338]  Go ahead.
[01:38:02.881 --> 01:38:03.942]  Howdy there, Alex.
[01:38:03.942 --> 01:38:07.245]  Greetings from a beautiful big sky day here in Montana.
[01:38:07.245 --> 01:38:09.667]  Sorry, I don't know my FEMA region right now.
[01:38:09.667 --> 01:38:12.750]  I'd like to think of it as the state of Montana for now, anyway.
[01:38:12.750 --> 01:38:13.971]  Yeah, what FEMA region?
[01:38:13.971 --> 01:38:21.659]  But then we should point out to the globalists and the NAU, they do say we're already in the global region system, and this is not the United States, officially.
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:25.402]  So what region?
[01:38:25.402 --> 01:38:32.047]  Guys, pull up Ken Fima Region Map and I can tell him what region he is in.
[01:38:32.047 --> 01:38:34.228]  Sorry, go ahead, caller.
[01:38:34.228 --> 01:38:36.810]  I was going to do that later.
[01:38:36.810 --> 01:38:38.952]  But I wanted to tell you about a couple things, Alex.
[01:38:38.952 --> 01:38:43.555]  First of all, I really enjoyed the video, the recent one with Sean Stone.
[01:38:43.555 --> 01:38:48.399]  I just think that's really an excellent collaborative effort between you guys and
[01:38:49.741 --> 01:39:03.987]  The funny one that was a while back, just a few years, staff, Aaron Dyke, Aaron McBreen, Rob Doop, just really think you have a dream team staff going right there in the fight against tyranny, Alex, and I just want to give those guys a little credit too.
[01:39:03.987 --> 01:39:10.810]  But I had one thing I wanted to tell you about was some Ron Paul supporters from up here in Montana.
[01:39:12.179 --> 01:39:29.712]  I saw a poster of this Wesley Clark speech that he was coming and they had talking points on there and they made it look like he was going to, you know, like, you know, oh, we're going to tell the real truth about 9-11 and I don't think we were told the real truth on that.
[01:39:30.496 --> 01:39:30.916]  I don't know.
[01:39:48.653 --> 01:39:56.076]  So, there really was, and it was three students, chosen students, they got up there, and let me tell you about this speech, okay?
[01:39:56.076 --> 01:40:03.739]  So, he gets up there, and he gives the speech, and, uh, afterwards, the students give him, uh, just lob softballs to him.
[01:40:03.739 --> 01:40:10.622]  I mean, there was no questions about the N-D-A-A, or, uh, wars without congressional approval.
[01:40:10.622 --> 01:40:14.383]  You know, these were just little softball questions.
[01:40:14.383 --> 01:40:16.564]  Anyway, but this is what the speech was like, Alex.
[01:40:16.564 --> 01:40:17.985]  It was absolutely, you could tell,
[01:40:18.857 --> 01:40:34.405]  He was 100% just New World Order all the way, because he starts out, he's telling us, it was like he had just seen your speech on Democide, because he gave us about 15 points on how great the government is.
[01:40:34.405 --> 01:40:38.167]  Everything, oh, they built our railroads forth, they built our highways.
[01:40:38.847 --> 01:40:52.997]  No, government literally is God to these people, and that's why they want to ruin our reproductive system, so you've got to go to the government health bureau to have them basically turn your DNA back on to rehabilitate your fertility.
[01:40:52.997 --> 01:40:56.099]  And they've said that that was their plan in all their policy reports.
[01:40:56.099 --> 01:41:03.865]  It's all a scientific dictatorship using Kim Kardashian and all these diversions to distract people from the real world.
[01:41:03.865 --> 01:41:05.126]  Great points, good to hear from you.
[01:41:05.726 --> 01:41:07.386]  By the way, you're in FEMA Region 8.
[01:41:07.386 --> 01:41:11.727]  We'll put that back up on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[01:41:11.727 --> 01:41:24.391]  There is the ten FEMA regions, and the Globalists break every other country into ten sub-districts as well, and the world is broken into, quote, ten kingdoms, according to the Club of Rome and UN.
[01:41:24.391 --> 01:41:26.631]  And, of course, we also read that in the Bible.
[01:41:26.631 --> 01:41:29.072]  They model it after that.
[01:41:29.072 --> 01:41:29.772]  The ten horns.
[01:41:31.142 --> 01:41:42.852]  Let's put the map back up for radio listeners, and I'll tell folks what, if you're up in the extreme northeast, Maine, down to Massachusetts, a little bit below, you are in 1.
[01:41:42.852 --> 01:41:47.475]  New York has its own region, along with Rhode Island, you are in number 2.
[01:41:48.996 --> 01:41:56.478]  Pennsylvania down into Virginia and West Virginia is FEMA region number three.
[01:41:56.478 --> 01:42:09.361]  If you are in the deep south of Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, you are in FEMA region four.
[01:42:09.361 --> 01:42:14.602]  If you're in Kansas or if you're in Missouri or surrounding areas, you are in
[01:42:15.987 --> 01:42:17.468]  FEMA Region 7.
[01:42:17.468 --> 01:42:25.594]  If you are in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, you are in FEMA Region 6.
[01:42:25.594 --> 01:42:32.300]  And if you are up there in the mountain in the northern states, in that area, FEMA Region 8.
[01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:37.564]  California, Nevada, and Arizona are FEMA Region 9.
[01:42:37.564 --> 01:42:39.905]  And of course, then you have Idaho.
[01:42:40.846 --> 01:42:45.991]  And you have Washington in Oregon and Alaska in FEMA Region 10.
[01:42:45.991 --> 01:43:06.970]  And Hawaii is also part of FEMA Region 10 under the Emergency War Powers Act restructuring of 1933 and other declarations of the private banks over the United States who now publicly have dominated and bankrupted Europe and are busy bringing in austerity to bankrupt and impoverish the public so they're too busy trying to find food then to fight back.
[01:43:07.410 --> 01:43:13.074]  So the social engineers can roll in with welfare payments if they'll take the vaccines to soft kill their families.
[01:43:13.074 --> 01:43:17.556]  Okay, continuing here as we report on the global offensives against humanity.
[01:43:17.556 --> 01:43:18.837]  Reporting from FEMA Region 6.
[01:43:18.837 --> 01:43:23.700]  Yeah, I used to run liners like 10 years ago about deep behind enemy lines, FEMA Region 6.
[01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:27.663]  And I'd get program directors of affiliates going, what is this?
[01:43:27.663 --> 01:43:28.643]  Behind enemy lines?
[01:43:28.643 --> 01:43:31.965]  Are you saying America's the enemy?
[01:43:31.965 --> 01:43:33.546]  Region 6?
[01:43:33.546 --> 01:43:34.347]  What is this stuff?
[01:43:35.387 --> 01:43:41.349]  And we play a clip from Red Dawn.
[01:43:41.349 --> 01:43:44.591]  Guys, YouTube Red Dawn radio transmission, something like that.
[01:43:44.591 --> 01:43:51.353]  And it's like, hi, this is, you know, transmitting from, you know, the free area into the Soviet occupied area.
[01:43:51.353 --> 01:43:52.754]  John has a long mustache.
[01:43:52.754 --> 01:43:54.074]  John has a long mustache.
[01:43:54.074 --> 01:44:03.018]  Puts out some codes for special forces behind enemy lines and then says, and remember, if you're on or behind enemy lines, this song is for you.
[01:44:04.039 --> 01:44:05.900]  And then they go into the music.
[01:44:05.900 --> 01:44:07.502]  We need to get that liner back.
[01:44:07.502 --> 01:44:10.184]  That used to be in the computer up there, John.
[01:44:10.184 --> 01:44:12.686]  And just for some reason, it just disappeared out of the system.
[01:44:12.686 --> 01:44:17.309]  But I want to get that clip from Red Dawn, and you play that going out of the break with music.
[01:44:17.309 --> 01:44:18.510]  It sounds pretty powerful.
[01:44:18.510 --> 01:44:20.612]  Because that's what we're actually doing.
[01:44:20.612 --> 01:44:21.873]  I mean, that's what this is.
[01:44:21.873 --> 01:44:24.475]  But see, it's a psychological warfare takeover.
[01:44:24.475 --> 01:44:29.339]  So all the regular institutions and things are still there, but it's a creeping takeover.
[01:44:30.114 --> 01:44:37.761]  You see, which is much harder to beat than a bunch of Soviets parachuting out of the sky.
[01:44:37.761 --> 01:44:40.884]  So, I mean, it's not a joke I come to you from behind enemy lines.
[01:44:40.884 --> 01:44:43.527]  I'm an occupied former republic.
[01:44:43.527 --> 01:44:50.313]  We are, the banks admit, the big mega banks, they have conquered the United States.
[01:44:50.313 --> 01:44:50.994]  This is real.
[01:44:54.650 --> 01:45:01.976]  But wait, the basketball's on, Dancing with the Stars is on, and we've got CNN, we've got the American flag everywhere.
[01:45:01.976 --> 01:45:10.462]  People put the American flag everywhere, and they think that means worshipping the system, crying and worshipping government and waving American flags.
[01:45:10.462 --> 01:45:14.365]  It now symbolizes gullibility and that you want to be used.
[01:45:14.365 --> 01:45:19.669]  And if you say to one of them, hey, the Tribs are down to do you poisoning, most of them don't want to be in the wars, they go, shut up, traitor!
[01:45:21.289 --> 01:45:23.319]  But we need to end the war, and I've seen these videos.
[01:45:23.319 --> 01:45:25.088]  I saw one they just released a few days ago.
[01:45:28.826 --> 01:45:38.094]  Adam Kokesh did where they're talking to this woman, a Mitt Romney supporter, and they're like, but the wars, the wars are illegal, and they're about resources, and they're wrong.
[01:45:38.094 --> 01:45:40.316]  And she's like, you just hate our military.
[01:45:40.316 --> 01:45:42.318]  We need to support them and support the wars.
[01:45:42.318 --> 01:45:45.380]  And they're like, but supporting wars doesn't support the military.
[01:45:45.380 --> 01:45:48.483]  The majority of the troops in major polls want to be out of these wars.
[01:45:48.483 --> 01:45:51.966]  And the majority of the money given to presidential candidates is to Ron Paul.
[01:45:51.966 --> 01:45:53.027]  She's like, that's not true.
[01:45:53.587 --> 01:45:55.167]  They're like, yeah, it's the SEC filings.
[01:45:55.167 --> 01:45:56.188]  No, it's not.
[01:45:56.188 --> 01:45:57.668]  You just hate the military.
[01:45:57.668 --> 01:46:03.750]  Well, actually, I was, you know, in Fallujah, the cameraman says, and was in Iraq for years as a Marine.
[01:46:03.750 --> 01:46:04.850]  Oh, yeah, right.
[01:46:04.850 --> 01:46:05.891]  And I have to know who the guy is.
[01:46:05.891 --> 01:46:06.971]  He was.
[01:46:06.971 --> 01:46:09.231]  And then, oh, yeah.
[01:46:09.231 --> 01:46:10.652]  The troops want the war.
[01:46:12.182 --> 01:46:13.524]  The troops want the war!
[01:46:13.524 --> 01:46:15.907]  I'm for the troops!
[01:46:15.907 --> 01:46:24.619]  And she's got like American flags festooned on her and she's waving a big... I mean, they have no conception of reality, these people.
[01:46:24.619 --> 01:46:26.922]  They have no conception.
[01:46:26.922 --> 01:46:29.545]  They think the government and the police
[01:46:30.999 --> 01:46:33.922]  Is America, and we're like the enemy.
[01:46:33.922 --> 01:46:37.085]  Government is God, government is good, like in North Korea.
[01:46:37.085 --> 01:46:40.688]  Anything it does is infallible, and the cops now more and more believe us.
[01:46:40.688 --> 01:46:49.575]  I mean, I'm real sad that all over the country, we go places, and we try to go on a city council, we try to just film on the street, and cops will walk up and go, turn it off.
[01:46:49.575 --> 01:46:50.937]  Get out of here.
[01:46:50.937 --> 01:46:52.858]  And I've actually had my reporters arrested.
[01:46:52.858 --> 01:46:56.862]  We're having to sue Pittsburgh.
[01:46:58.052 --> 01:47:02.175]  And I saw that footage in Pittsburgh of the police, the day the thing had ended.
[01:47:02.175 --> 01:47:09.720]  They wanted to have something, so they went into the university area with people out doing studies and eating sandwiches, you know, out in the park.
[01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:16.945]  And they announced, get out of here, no one allowed out, period, no congregating, we have suspended regular liberties in the city.
[01:47:16.945 --> 01:47:20.227]  And it's like something out of a science fiction movie over loudspeakers.
[01:47:20.227 --> 01:47:25.951]  And so, you know, the kids start getting up, and then they, and then, uh-oh, they've been blocked in, they're not allowed to leave.
[01:47:26.946 --> 01:47:28.347]  This is a beta test.
[01:47:28.347 --> 01:47:37.272]  They want to see if they can have cops attack innocent people dressed up in their anonymity, you know, cloaking psycho outfits, their torture outfits.
[01:47:37.272 --> 01:47:41.875]  And I've got video of just people trying to get out and women on bicycles and cops beating them.
[01:47:41.875 --> 01:47:46.438]  I mean, you could kill somebody just like full power with those nightstitches.
[01:47:46.438 --> 01:47:49.560]  I just like, you know, the type of blow you'd use to kill somebody.
[01:47:50.598 --> 01:47:57.714]  And people running into the dorms and the cops went into the dorms like sharks in a feeding frenzy and were arresting the young people.
[01:47:59.932 --> 01:48:04.756]  And Dews up on a hilltop, and they're kettling everybody in, blocking them where they can't leave.
[01:48:04.756 --> 01:48:08.720]  Burmas cuts down an alleyway where we wouldn't even have the footage.
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:12.683]  And they come to Dews up on a hilltop, and there's a local, what was it, NBC News team.
[01:48:12.683 --> 01:48:14.265]  And they said, who are you with?
[01:48:14.265 --> 01:48:15.246]  NBC.
[01:48:15.246 --> 01:48:16.727]  Do you have the G20 credential?
[01:48:16.727 --> 01:48:17.728]  Just to be in the city.
[01:48:17.728 --> 01:48:21.451]  The G20, the global banker heads, they give you a credential.
[01:48:21.451 --> 01:48:23.753]  See, the police were under the foreign banker command.
[01:48:24.628 --> 01:48:26.190]  And they go, oh, okay, you can go.
[01:48:26.190 --> 01:48:28.432]  Well, do you have G20 credentials?
[01:48:28.432 --> 01:48:31.176]  And Rob's like, and we got the tape later back.
[01:48:31.176 --> 01:48:32.798]  Is the camera still rolling?
[01:48:32.798 --> 01:48:37.183]  He goes, well, no, it's the First Amendment, but I'm not inside the G20.
[01:48:37.183 --> 01:48:39.866]  All right, on your knees!
[01:48:39.866 --> 01:48:43.510]  And they put bags over people's heads in the backs of flatback trucks.
[01:48:44.665 --> 01:49:00.310]  He goes to a military base and there's troops with the police stomping around making fun of people, watching them urinate, making fun of them, people with bags on their heads, and I mean it was all, and the cops were like crazed in the military.
[01:49:02.931 --> 01:49:06.692]  The hand-picked ones they'd gotten were just stomping around in the rain.
[01:49:06.692 --> 01:49:11.354]  They had them all tied up in the rain, getting off on stomping around and looking.
[01:49:11.354 --> 01:49:19.397]  It's just like hour after hour of power tripping like a child.
[01:49:19.397 --> 01:49:21.618]  And that's the country I live in.
[01:49:21.618 --> 01:49:26.699]  About to walk in in a suit and tie with a microphone into a big city council building, and cops pull up, who are you?
[01:49:26.699 --> 01:49:27.380]  Get out of here!
[01:49:27.380 --> 01:49:28.040]  You're not going in there!
[01:49:28.695 --> 01:49:30.136]  Because they had, I guess, intelligence.
[01:49:30.136 --> 01:49:33.318]  I mean, I announced my guys were going about the death of this guy.
[01:49:33.318 --> 01:49:35.459]  You're not going in there, no, you're not allowed to.
[01:49:35.459 --> 01:49:36.200]  Well, what's the law?
[01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:36.940]  It doesn't matter.
[01:49:36.940 --> 01:49:38.962]  Just get out of here.
[01:49:38.962 --> 01:49:41.984]  Just following orders, pal.
[01:49:41.984 --> 01:49:44.866]  I mean, that is bonafide naked tyranny.
[01:49:44.866 --> 01:49:46.387]  Okay, I'm going to go to break.
[01:49:46.387 --> 01:49:50.109]  Come back, go to Freedom Fighter.
[01:49:50.109 --> 01:49:52.711]  Mark, Pete, Justin, Max, I'll get to all of you here.
[01:49:53.757 --> 01:50:01.599]  Briefly, it is your funding of our operation that makes this broadcast possible, but that's not the main reason that you need to get involved in this.
[01:50:01.599 --> 01:50:03.380]  That's just a caveat.
[01:50:03.380 --> 01:50:14.603]  The Alex Pack, which is the Healthy Start Pack, has a tangy tangerine and just the other incredible things that the top developers of these systems recommend, like Dr. Joel Wallach.
[01:50:15.826 --> 01:50:16.306]  I don't know.
[01:50:39.611 --> 01:50:42.333]  Used to, I'd eat a whole steak and then want to order another.
[01:50:42.333 --> 01:50:45.535]  Now I eat half the steak and, you know, take the rest home.
[01:50:45.535 --> 01:50:48.316]  Now I, you know, eat half a bowl of pasta and a salad.
[01:50:48.316 --> 01:50:50.517]  I don't want three bowls of pasta.
[01:50:50.517 --> 01:50:54.180]  It's because I'm getting the minerals I need beyond Tangy Tangerine.
[01:50:54.180 --> 01:50:56.001]  Infowarsteam.com.
[01:50:56.001 --> 01:50:57.401]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:57.401 --> 01:50:57.942]  Stay with us.
[01:51:01.135 --> 01:51:09.803]  I'd seen the Longevity products work for many others, and so I bought a bunch of them, started using them, had a little bit of results, but I wasn't following the regimen every day.
[01:51:09.803 --> 01:51:14.006]  But Aaron Dykes in my office did, and lost more than 60 pounds.
[01:51:14.006 --> 01:51:17.750]  When I saw those results, I said, I better follow my own advice.
[01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:21.213]  I started taking the Longevity products, and it's been incredible.
[01:51:21.213 --> 01:51:23.855]  37 pounds in two months.
[01:51:23.855 --> 01:51:27.098]  Our bodies are amazing, and God gave us an incredible gift.
[01:51:27.318 --> 01:51:36.205]  But if our body doesn't have the tools it needs, all of the vitamins, all of the minerals, and the other key essential trace elements, we're not going to be healthy.
[01:51:36.205 --> 01:51:37.406]  Folks, this isn't hype.
[01:51:37.406 --> 01:51:41.650]  I only bring to my listeners products that I've tried myself that I truly believe in.
[01:51:41.650 --> 01:51:47.595]  And the amazing supplements available at infowarsteam.com have certainly delivered my life.

[01:52:03.107 --> 01:52:03.627]  Water.
[01:52:03.627 --> 01:52:07.030]  It's essential for sustaining life, but it's not always the most available.
[01:52:07.030 --> 01:52:13.615]  When disaster strikes, water quickly vanishes from store shelves, like it did during 9-11, Katrina, Japan, and in Joplin.
[01:52:13.735 --> 01:52:16.417]  Three days without water and your body begins to shut down.
[01:52:16.417 --> 01:52:20.299]  Don't risk being without an abundant supply of water when the next disaster hits.
[01:52:20.299 --> 01:52:21.840]  Get a FlowJack hand well pump.

[01:53:57.527 --> 01:53:58.668]  Peace through preparedness.
[01:54:33.683 --> 01:54:51.335]  By the way, I just talked to Darren McBreen and Marcos Morales, our reporters, and there's been big developments in Roswell, Georgia, the site of the suspicious death of a evil chicken farmer who's now dead, thanks to the new world order on 1021.
[01:54:51.335 --> 01:54:54.357]  There's been a new development with the police and others.
[01:54:54.357 --> 01:54:56.798]  They'll be joining us at the bottom of the next hour.
[01:54:56.798 --> 01:54:58.419]  Right now, let's go back to your calls.
[01:54:58.419 --> 01:55:01.882]  Freedom Fighter in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:55:01.882 --> 01:55:02.242]  Go ahead.
[01:55:03.416 --> 01:55:08.358]  Alex, here in Austin on May 12th, hopefully we will elect Clay DeFoe mayor.
[01:55:08.358 --> 01:55:13.799]  Clay DeFoe is a long time Ron Paul enthusiast who has been continually embarrassing the entire Austin city council.
[01:55:13.799 --> 01:55:16.380]  Sir, I'm sorry, I can't understand you and I appreciate your call.
[01:55:16.380 --> 01:55:18.081]  Your phone's distorted.
[01:55:18.081 --> 01:55:20.301]  Uh, let's go ahead and talk to Mark in Nevada.
[01:55:20.301 --> 01:55:21.222]  Mark, you're on the air.
[01:55:21.222 --> 01:55:21.622]  Go ahead.
[01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:25.002]  Alex, it's good to talk to you, brother.
[01:55:25.002 --> 01:55:26.543]  I am pissed, okay?
[01:55:26.543 --> 01:55:30.446]  I'm originally from Canada, and I immigrated here.
[01:55:30.446 --> 01:55:32.528]  I'm in FEMA Region 9 in Nevada.
[01:55:32.528 --> 01:55:35.470]  It's such a police state here, it makes me sick.
[01:55:35.470 --> 01:55:37.172]  I had a vaccine injury, Alex.
[01:55:37.927 --> 01:55:39.788]  In Canada, okay?
[01:55:39.788 --> 01:55:41.409]  The thing almost killed me.
[01:55:41.409 --> 01:55:43.030]  The doctors abandoned me.
[01:55:43.030 --> 01:55:46.812]  My uncle was almost killed by a tetanus shot.
[01:55:46.812 --> 01:55:50.675]  My mother never got sick, took a flu shot and almost killed her.
[01:55:50.675 --> 01:55:51.575]  Like 10 years ago.
[01:55:51.575 --> 01:55:55.578]  Because she was going to do a triathlon and wanted to do it a month before she... I mean it's just...
[01:55:55.998 --> 01:56:02.940]  Alex, the day I watched the groundbreaking show with you and Jesse Ventura on Conspiracy Theory, and I use that title of that show very loosely, that show is all facts.
[01:56:25.948 --> 01:56:29.450]  It was like watching exactly what happened to me.
[01:56:29.450 --> 01:56:31.191]  I couldn't believe others were suffering.
[01:56:31.191 --> 01:56:34.152]  For those who don't know, Homeland Security threatened TruTV.
[01:56:34.152 --> 01:56:38.535]  There was a bunch of behind-the-scenes stuff I can't talk about.
[01:56:38.535 --> 01:56:42.697]  But they pulled it from television, because it normally airs more than 50 times over the next year.
[01:56:42.697 --> 01:56:47.239]  It aired once, the Police State episode that I, of course, was instrumental in engineering.
[01:56:47.239 --> 01:56:52.862]  I mean, it had the biggest footprint in it of any of the shows I've consulted on or been in.
[01:56:52.862 --> 01:56:53.883]  So tell us what happened to you.
[01:56:55.168 --> 01:56:56.510]  Well, pretty much.
[01:56:56.510 --> 01:57:04.639]  You go in there and, you know, I'm 35 years old, I'm a few years younger than you, and I missed the hepatitis B vaccine in high school.
[01:57:04.639 --> 01:57:10.005]  I just went in for a checkup, and these nurses, this lady looked like Nurse Ratched, okay?
[01:57:10.005 --> 01:57:11.106]  She was, like, most evil.
[01:57:11.106 --> 01:57:12.348]  I should have got a hint right there.
[01:57:12.748 --> 01:57:15.629]  And she's telling me, OK, we can vaccinate you today.
[01:57:15.629 --> 01:57:19.450]  And I thought I missed a mandatory vaccine.
[01:57:19.450 --> 01:57:23.171]  Big, huge posters, Alex, saying hepatitis B vaccine.
[01:57:23.171 --> 01:57:23.772]  It's safe.
[01:57:23.772 --> 01:57:24.612]  It's safe.
[01:57:24.612 --> 01:57:25.792]  OK, I'm not a homosexual.
[01:57:25.792 --> 01:57:27.293]  I'm not an intravenous drug user.
[01:57:27.293 --> 01:57:28.153]  I'm not at risk.
[01:57:28.153 --> 01:57:29.354]  OK, I got a kid.
[01:57:29.354 --> 01:57:29.894]  I'm a single parent.
[01:57:29.894 --> 01:57:32.214]  Since they began inoculating, everybody's getting it.
[01:57:32.214 --> 01:57:33.435]  So what happens?
[01:57:33.435 --> 01:57:38.957]  They give you the shot that they give babies, part of their brain damaging regimen they put them on at birth.
[01:57:38.957 --> 01:57:39.577]  What happened next?
[01:57:40.658 --> 01:57:41.058]  Right.
[01:57:41.058 --> 01:57:42.159]  I almost dropped dead.
[01:57:42.159 --> 01:57:44.001]  My whole body went hypersensitive.
[01:57:44.001 --> 01:57:46.142]  As you know, it's a three-shot series.
[01:57:46.142 --> 01:57:50.846]  The first shot, all my skin went red.
[01:57:50.846 --> 01:57:53.228]  Immediately, I was just fatigued.
[01:57:53.228 --> 01:57:54.349]  I had joint pain.
[01:57:54.349 --> 01:57:55.349]  Oh, but let me guess.
[01:57:55.349 --> 01:57:59.132]  They told you that it wasn't the shot that did it.
[01:57:59.132 --> 01:58:00.113]  You got it, sir.
[01:58:00.113 --> 01:58:02.054]  It was a coincidence!
[01:58:02.054 --> 01:58:08.780]  And it's not torture to break people's arms, to make them answer questions, or to tase your five-year-olds.
[01:58:09.710 --> 01:58:10.831]  It's not torture.
[01:58:10.831 --> 01:58:12.933]  We should all wear taser bracelets when we fly.
[01:58:12.933 --> 01:58:14.714]  Homeland Security's looking at me.
[01:58:14.714 --> 01:58:15.395]  That's freedom.
[01:58:15.395 --> 01:58:18.958]  I appreciate your call, extremist.
[01:58:18.958 --> 01:58:22.681]  I mean, you know... Okay, I am the bad man.
[01:58:22.681 --> 01:58:28.265]  HBO, what they're doing... I guess I'm evil because I think HBO's doing bad things.
[01:58:28.265 --> 01:58:29.466]  By the way, see how we're conditioned?
[01:58:29.466 --> 01:58:32.949]  Nobody's even calling in upset about HBO.
[01:58:32.949 --> 01:58:33.990]  You know what HBO's doing?
[01:58:33.990 --> 01:58:37.412]  If you just joined us, I'll tell you when we come up in the next hour.
[01:58:37.412 --> 01:58:38.713]  Cover a bunch of news and your call.

[02:00:25.514 --> 02:00:27.516]  I'll be back on the radio this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:00:27.516 --> 02:00:27.736]  Central.
[02:00:27.736 --> 02:00:30.338]  Let's continue with your phone calls.
[02:00:30.338 --> 02:00:32.620]  I'm going to hit a bunch of news in the segment after that.
[02:00:34.017 --> 02:00:42.784]  More calls and then we've got a report from Georgia side of the June 21 extermination operations going well.
[02:00:42.784 --> 02:00:45.306]  Let's go ahead and talk to Pete in Michigan.
[02:00:45.306 --> 02:00:47.548]  Pete, you're on the air.
[02:00:47.548 --> 02:00:49.209]  Hi Alex, can you hear me okay?
[02:00:49.209 --> 02:00:51.531]  I hear you pretty good, yeah.
[02:00:51.531 --> 02:00:58.056]  I called in a couple days ago and talked to your health ranger about a case up here in Michigan that violated my Fourth Amendment right
[02:00:59.407 --> 02:01:02.089]  He had said that you folks might do a follow-up on it.
[02:01:02.089 --> 02:01:04.590]  I was just wondering if you were going to get back with me on the case.
[02:01:04.590 --> 02:01:05.710]  Yeah, I'll be honest with you.
[02:01:05.710 --> 02:01:07.891]  I didn't hear the whole show that day.
[02:01:07.891 --> 02:01:09.292]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[02:01:09.292 --> 02:01:11.333]  I missed the call.
[02:01:11.333 --> 02:01:17.176]  Basically, to sum it up, I have been harassed by the local law enforcement for 12 years.
[02:01:17.176 --> 02:01:21.618]  I've been a self-proclaimed info warrior fighting the power for that long.
[02:01:23.263 --> 02:01:30.974]  You know, I've got a string of arrests where they falsely arrested me and dropped charges or I've won the cases because there was no evidence.
[02:01:30.974 --> 02:01:36.842]  Yeah, you might end up like the chicken man in Georgia, because he kept winning and of course they won in the end.
[02:01:36.842 --> 02:01:37.863]  They've got the firepower.
[02:01:40.186 --> 02:01:41.167]  So does Kim Jong-il.
[02:01:41.167 --> 02:01:42.468]  He's winning.
[02:01:42.468 --> 02:01:45.349]  He's not alive anymore, but his son is ruling over North Korea.
[02:01:45.349 --> 02:01:47.311]  Another blessing of government.
[02:01:47.311 --> 02:01:52.314]  Government just makes the sun shine, the grass grow, the Easter bunnies hop.
[02:01:52.314 --> 02:01:53.515]  Send us more info, sir.
[02:01:53.515 --> 02:01:55.156]  I appreciate your call.
[02:01:55.156 --> 02:01:57.837]  You know, you could also move out of the area, too.
[02:01:57.837 --> 02:02:02.820]  Or you could go on the offensive in the info war and really start exposing it, which I'm sure you've been doing.
[02:02:02.820 --> 02:02:04.622]  Justin in California, you're on the air.
[02:02:04.622 --> 02:02:04.962]  Go ahead.
[02:02:06.300 --> 02:02:09.782]  Hello Alex, this is Justin from FEMA Region 9.
[02:02:09.782 --> 02:02:20.129]  Okay, I think it's good we announced what FEMA region we're in, so other Americans start to realize, wow, I'm under a FEMA government and Congress is told what to do by FEMA, which is run by foreign banks.
[02:02:20.129 --> 02:02:20.329]  Yeah.
[02:02:21.483 --> 02:02:22.564]  Exactly.
[02:02:22.564 --> 02:02:25.185]  Well, I was calling to say that, you know, your show has changed my life.
[02:02:25.185 --> 02:02:30.829]  It's not only opened my eyes to all the tearing that's going on, but also to all the health issues.
[02:02:30.829 --> 02:02:36.352]  I want to say that I've been on the tangerine for about two months, lost about 30 pounds, feeling the best I ever felt.
[02:02:36.352 --> 02:02:39.174]  And it doesn't even advertise it's for weight loss!
[02:02:40.755 --> 02:02:41.896]  I mean, that's the thing about them.
[02:02:41.896 --> 02:02:43.277]  Look at me, folks.
[02:02:43.277 --> 02:02:52.185]  I was running and jogging and swimming and, you know, went from 270 to about 255, but could never go down.
[02:02:52.185 --> 02:02:59.070]  And I go on this and 40 pounds now, you know, the ad says 38 or whatever, but it's more than 40 now.
[02:02:59.070 --> 02:02:59.971]  Bam, 40 pounds.
[02:03:01.092 --> 02:03:01.272]  For sure.
[02:03:01.272 --> 02:03:03.335]  I started at about $290 and after about two months I'm about $240 now.
[02:03:20.658 --> 02:03:28.562]  Did you notice that just suddenly, I mean because I can't get my own food during the break and I bought the office barbecue today, so they brought me a plate.
[02:03:28.562 --> 02:03:33.004]  It was like a big plate and I ate like a third of it and then didn't even, I just stopped.
[02:03:33.004 --> 02:03:36.466]  In the old days, I would eat that entire plate.
[02:03:36.466 --> 02:03:39.807]  Exactly, I mean, it's just like a miracle product.
[02:03:39.807 --> 02:03:43.149]  You only eat half the stuff, the weight just falls off you, you feel better than you ever felt.
[02:03:44.091 --> 02:03:47.954]  Well, the reason for my call, though, is not to really, uh, about the tangerines.
[02:03:47.954 --> 02:04:02.847]  Yesterday I was involved in something, um, I was almost arrested yesterday, uh, by a police officer because I was having electrical problems at my house and I went to turn the breaker box off because I had, uh, flickering lights and arcing wires.
[02:04:02.847 --> 02:04:05.289]  So I went to cut the power to get my breaker box fixed.
[02:04:06.605 --> 02:04:11.689]  Uh, my next door neighbor shares a pump with me, a water pump, and it's run off of my power box.
[02:04:11.689 --> 02:04:18.074]  So when I shut it off, they called the cops on me, saying that I did it out of spite to cut them off of water, which wasn't true.
[02:04:18.074 --> 02:04:20.176]  I was cutting it off to prevent my house from burning down.
[02:04:20.176 --> 02:04:20.576]  I know.
[02:04:20.576 --> 02:04:27.762]  Listen, it's this culture, because again, who's really bad are these citizens who call the police for no reason.
[02:04:27.762 --> 02:04:31.825]  I mean, folks, you better not call the police unless you've got a serious issue.
[02:04:32.679 --> 02:04:37.480]  I mean, a lot of times I see stuff, and if it's petty, I don't even call the police.
[02:04:37.480 --> 02:04:40.841]  Because, most of the time, it just causes a problem.
[02:04:40.841 --> 02:04:41.601]  So, what happened?
[02:04:41.601 --> 02:04:42.801]  The police officer came over?
[02:04:42.801 --> 02:04:44.462]  I mean, you're going to get arrested now?
[02:04:44.462 --> 02:04:47.802]  Everybody knows when you're having problems, turn your electricity off.
[02:04:47.802 --> 02:04:49.763]  It's like if your toilet breaks.
[02:04:49.763 --> 02:04:50.843]  I've had a water line break.
[02:04:50.843 --> 02:04:51.983]  You go turn the water off.
[02:04:51.983 --> 02:04:53.444]  I mean, what?

[02:06:02.323 --> 02:06:04.684]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[02:06:04.684 --> 02:06:07.825]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[02:06:07.825 --> 02:06:12.647]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[02:06:12.647 --> 02:06:19.009]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[02:06:19.489 --> 02:06:30.715]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.

[02:06:35.197 --> 02:06:38.199]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day,
[02:06:38.559 --> 02:06:41.441]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.

[02:07:57.535 --> 02:07:58.335]  Got it.
[02:07:58.335 --> 02:07:58.815]  Others don't.
[02:08:05.851 --> 02:08:10.674]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:08:10.674 --> 02:08:12.275]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.275 --> 02:08:13.816]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.816 --> 02:08:17.998]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.998 --> 02:08:22.061]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:23.781 --> 02:08:30.462]  All right, let me finish up with a caller here, and then I need to get back into some of the news I haven't covered yet, including some earthquake news.
[02:08:30.462 --> 02:08:32.243]  It's very important, obviously.
[02:08:32.243 --> 02:08:42.844]  Also, big predictions by NOAA weather service of huge tornadoes throughout the middle of the country into Texas over the weekend, with some of the hot and cold air coming together.
[02:08:42.844 --> 02:08:44.605]  So definitely look out for that.
[02:08:44.605 --> 02:08:47.465]  You know, smart like the old-timers had storm cellars.
[02:08:47.465 --> 02:08:50.206]  Nowadays, we just watch TV and do what the government says.
[02:08:50.206 --> 02:08:51.686]  That'll protect us from the tornadoes.
[02:08:52.563 --> 02:08:57.906]  It's this culture of always counting on the system to do everything for you.
[02:08:57.906 --> 02:09:01.568]  The nanny state is totally domesticating us.
[02:09:01.568 --> 02:09:02.528]  Look at this article.
[02:09:02.528 --> 02:09:06.190]  I see stories like this all the time.
[02:09:06.190 --> 02:09:18.216]  And we'll put that article on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[02:09:18.216 --> 02:09:19.117]  A man was shot.
[02:09:20.598 --> 02:09:32.967]  More than 90 times with no firearm or no weapon, his crime was running from the police.
[02:09:32.967 --> 02:09:39.252]  Okay, just so I can read it, I just want to have it where the headline and the text is like right there in the middle.
[02:09:39.252 --> 02:09:41.694]  That's the shot I want to show people right there.
[02:09:43.422 --> 02:09:44.443]  You just need to get a better computer.
[02:09:44.443 --> 02:09:47.908]  I know that computer is a little bit... See the edge just got off a little bit.
[02:09:47.908 --> 02:09:56.060]  The way I want it is where you can see the white on the other side of the headline right there where I can see it.
[02:09:56.060 --> 02:09:56.941]  Eight L.A.
[02:09:56.941 --> 02:09:57.361]  officers...
[02:09:59.062 --> 02:10:04.704]  Fire more than 90 bullets at freeway chase suspect who said he had a gun.
[02:10:04.704 --> 02:10:09.865]  And so I can see over the fact that they claim that someone said that he had a gun, so he was shot 90 times.
[02:10:09.865 --> 02:10:11.806]  I mean, I think 90 is a little excessive.
[02:10:11.806 --> 02:10:21.189]  How about only 89 shots?
[02:10:21.189 --> 02:10:26.991]  Okay, let's go ahead and go back and finish up with a caller who was talking about how
[02:10:28.535 --> 02:10:29.916]  I guess he's in a duplex.
[02:10:29.916 --> 02:10:31.197]  His lights were going all crazy.
[02:10:31.197 --> 02:10:33.059]  His power was going all crazy.
[02:10:33.059 --> 02:10:35.080]  So he went and turned the power breaker off.
[02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:39.643]  So the neighbor, instead of talking to him, called the police on him.
[02:10:39.643 --> 02:10:46.688]  I mean, if I saw my neighbor flip a breaker and my power went off, I'd say, hey, Bob, why'd you turn the power off?
[02:10:46.688 --> 02:10:48.669]  What's going on?
[02:10:48.669 --> 02:10:52.352]  Before I call the police and then if Bob said, shut up, you deserve it.
[02:10:52.352 --> 02:10:56.375]  I'd be like, hey, you better turn that back on or I don't have to call the police.
[02:10:59.059 --> 02:11:03.564]  Quite frankly, I'd probably get mad, but, oh, whatever.
[02:11:03.564 --> 02:11:04.685]  Go ahead and finish your story.
[02:11:04.685 --> 02:11:12.334]  So you're up to the point of, you turned the power breaker off, and that's connected also to the water pump that goes to both sides of the house.
[02:11:12.334 --> 02:11:13.275]  Finish up with what happened.
[02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:21.682]  Yes sir, well we live in the country and it's a shared pump with me and my uncle who lives next door and I had a lot of problems with my uncle.
[02:11:21.682 --> 02:11:22.962]  They tried to kill me in the past.
[02:11:22.962 --> 02:11:25.343]  They got arrested with assault with a deadly weapon.
[02:11:25.343 --> 02:11:27.663]  The charges were never filed so we got a restraining order.
[02:11:27.663 --> 02:11:31.484]  Then there was about 30 instances where the restraining order got broken.
[02:11:31.484 --> 02:11:32.964]  Nothing really happened over it.
[02:11:32.964 --> 02:11:35.905]  That's why the reason why they called the cops right away.
[02:11:35.905 --> 02:11:38.226]  It's because of ongoing problems.
[02:11:38.226 --> 02:11:38.846]  But the thing is,
[02:11:39.406 --> 02:11:41.928]  I mean, I pay the PG&E.
[02:11:41.928 --> 02:11:43.349]  It's all, it's in my name.
[02:11:43.349 --> 02:11:45.991]  It's under my, uh, uh, you know.
[02:11:45.991 --> 02:11:51.935]  I called PG&E before the cops got there and asked if I was within my rights to turn it off and they said I most certainly was.
[02:11:51.935 --> 02:12:02.362]  And my lawyer also said I was too, so when the cop got there, it was a lady officer and she was, uh, she was already upset as soon as she got out the door because she had known about the ongoing problem.
[02:12:02.362 --> 02:12:07.646]  As soon as she walked out of her cop car, she's like, I know you don't like him and he doesn't like you and
[02:12:08.607 --> 02:12:10.708]  Just attitude right out the door.
[02:12:10.708 --> 02:12:15.950]  So I had it turned off, and so she goes and turns them all back on.
[02:12:15.950 --> 02:12:23.533]  And so then I went up to the box and was going to turn them back off saying, listen lady, if you turn this power on, my house could burn down.
[02:12:23.533 --> 02:12:27.255]  And she said, if you turn off those switches, I'm going to arrest you.
[02:12:27.255 --> 02:12:28.596]  And she was reaching for her cuffs.
[02:12:28.596 --> 02:12:33.778]  Well I've always made the point, with the police now saying you can't go in the city council on video,
[02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:39.542]  For no reason with police saying we're going to take your kid because you didn't give him shots.
[02:12:39.542 --> 02:12:40.143]  No law.
[02:12:40.143 --> 02:12:41.584]  What they're doing is illegal.
[02:12:41.584 --> 02:12:48.487]  It's reached the point like North Korea where pretty soon you come in and the cops are like cook me a chocolate cake.
[02:12:48.487 --> 02:12:49.628]  You're like no.
[02:12:49.628 --> 02:12:51.589]  I'm going to arrest you then.
[02:12:51.589 --> 02:12:53.010]  So what happened?
[02:12:53.010 --> 02:12:54.751]  She flipped it back on and what happened?
[02:12:56.179 --> 02:12:59.963]  I would show up and say, I am not your nanny to the other neighbor.
[02:12:59.963 --> 02:13:01.324]  You need to call an electrician.
[02:13:01.324 --> 02:13:03.186]  Don't call the police for this and I would leave.
[02:13:19.844 --> 02:13:20.785]  Yeah.
[02:13:20.785 --> 02:13:23.866]  I mean, literally, where is common sense in this country?
[02:13:23.866 --> 02:13:27.188]  Call an electrician, not the police.
[02:13:27.188 --> 02:13:27.648]  Exactly.
[02:13:27.648 --> 02:13:31.250]  Well, they thought because of all the problems in the past, they just called the cops first thing.
[02:13:31.250 --> 02:13:33.011]  I mean, they don't even talk to me.
[02:13:33.011 --> 02:13:35.012]  It's just calling the cops.
[02:13:35.012 --> 02:13:35.752]  Yeah, I know.
[02:13:35.752 --> 02:13:40.295]  There are a lot of these weirdos who call the police constantly.
[02:13:40.295 --> 02:13:41.275]  I mean, I had a neighbor.
[02:13:41.275 --> 02:13:42.676]  I'm not going to get into it.
[02:13:42.676 --> 02:13:43.397]  It's just crazy.
[02:13:43.397 --> 02:13:44.037]  Thank you for the call.
[02:13:44.037 --> 02:13:45.738]  I really appreciate the point she just made, sir.
[02:13:47.873 --> 02:13:54.437]  Okay, let me get into this earthquake news here because there's a lot of disinformation going on.
[02:13:54.437 --> 02:14:01.561]  Fracking, when it's done in areas that are built up or when it's done improperly, is a problem.
[02:14:01.561 --> 02:14:09.985]  It is toxic chemicals that they use in extracting natural gas and oil and shoring up the different stratas.
[02:14:09.985 --> 02:14:11.907]  It is needed to get the oil and gas.
[02:14:11.907 --> 02:14:14.008]  It can be done properly.
[02:14:15.563 --> 02:14:23.531]  But what's happening is now it's being blamed for earthquakes that are happening in the Midwest and other areas.
[02:14:23.531 --> 02:14:37.364]  And there are major studies that show that giant oil fields over time can suck out enough oil or gas to then in one big event have some settling or a small earthquake.
[02:14:37.364 --> 02:14:38.284]  That's been confirmed.
[02:14:39.381 --> 02:14:45.342]  But they're now saying that earthquakes in the Midwest and other areas are being caused by fracking, period.
[02:14:45.342 --> 02:14:48.023]  That's an article out of Bloomberg.
[02:14:48.023 --> 02:14:49.363]  And that's just not the case.
[02:14:49.363 --> 02:14:56.684]  I mean, the Mississippi River has had its course changed repeatedly in the last 200 years after giant Midwestern earthquakes.
[02:14:56.684 --> 02:15:03.925]  So the Earth goes through cycles tectonically, and to say that humans and their fracking is what's doing it is ridiculous.
[02:15:03.925 --> 02:15:06.286]  Now as for the big booms, we've got an article going up
[02:15:07.185 --> 02:15:07.525]  I don't know.
[02:15:36.849 --> 02:15:52.138]  And this is out of the End of the American Dream blog and they did some great research here and they link through to all the different factoids and government announcements here and tectonic research from seismologists.
[02:15:52.138 --> 02:15:59.042]  The Ring of Fire is roaring to life and there will be earthquakes of historic importance on the west coast of the United States.
[02:16:00.202 --> 02:16:04.704]  Does it seem to you like there's been an unusual amount of seismic activity around the world lately?
[02:16:04.704 --> 02:16:06.805]  Well, it isn't just your imagination.
[02:16:06.805 --> 02:16:12.627]  The Ring of Fire is roaring to life, and there is really bad news for the West Coast of the United States.
[02:16:12.627 --> 02:16:19.911]  Approximately 90% of all earthquakes and approximately 75% of all volcanic eruptions occur along the Ring of Fire.
[02:16:23.160 --> 02:16:25.222]  We can show people on screen the Ring of Fire.
[02:16:25.222 --> 02:16:26.463]  You can just look it up if you want to.
[02:16:26.463 --> 02:16:47.939]  It goes all the way around the Pacific, around Australia, around Southeast Asia, China, Japan, over the Pacific to the North, down along Alaska, down the West Coast of Canada, the West Coast of the U.S., right down Central and South America, down to Chile.
[02:16:47.939 --> 02:16:51.542]  That's why the Indies, or the Andes, have so many earthquakes there.
[02:16:53.035 --> 02:16:56.396]  You can see that barrier reef of islands that come off Alaska.
[02:16:56.396 --> 02:17:00.998]  Those are there from tectonic activity with the seafloor being driven up.
[02:17:00.998 --> 02:17:06.880]  The Ring of Fire is roaring to life, and that is really bad news for the West Coast of the United States.
[02:17:06.880 --> 02:17:14.742]  Considering the fact that the entire West Coast of the United States lies along the Ring of Fire, we should be concerned that the Ring of Fire is becoming more active.
[02:17:14.742 --> 02:17:22.245]  On Wednesday, the most powerful strike-slip earthquake ever recorded happened along the Ring of Fire.
[02:17:24.275 --> 02:17:26.478]  If that earthquake had happened in a major U.S.
[02:17:26.478 --> 02:17:30.664]  city along the West Coast, the city would have been entirely destroyed.
[02:17:30.664 --> 02:17:32.847]  They have a link to the documents proving that.
[02:17:32.847 --> 02:17:33.187]  That's true.
[02:17:33.187 --> 02:17:35.210]  It would just be total devastation.
[02:17:35.210 --> 02:17:37.293]  Scientists tell us that there is nearly a 100% chance
[02:17:40.222 --> 02:17:44.425]  And a certainty that the big one will hit California at some point.
[02:17:44.425 --> 02:17:51.410]  In recent years we've seen Japan, Chile, Indonesia and New Zealand all get hit by historic earthquakes.
[02:17:51.410 --> 02:17:58.014]  It is inevitable that there will be earthquakes of historic importance on the west coast of the United States as well.
[02:17:58.014 --> 02:18:03.718]  So far we have been very fortunate, but the good fortune will not last indefinitely.
[02:18:03.718 --> 02:18:08.041]  In a previous article they showed that earthquakes are becoming more frequent.
[02:18:08.795 --> 02:18:12.437]  Around the globe, and they have links to that data.
[02:18:12.437 --> 02:18:19.341]  In 2001, there were 137 earthquakes of magnitude 6.0 or greater, and in 2011 there were 205.
[02:18:19.341 --> 02:18:30.268]  The charts and data that are presented in the previous article show a clear upward trend in large global earthquakes, just so happen to be hitting population centers most of the time, over the past decade.
[02:18:30.268 --> 02:18:31.069]  And that is why
[02:18:32.179 --> 02:18:34.300]  What happened this week is so alarming.
[02:18:34.300 --> 02:18:40.485]  On Wednesday, a magnitude 8.6 earthquake struck off the coast of Indonesia.
[02:18:40.485 --> 02:18:45.168]  And that was rapidly followed by a magnitude 8.2 earthquake off the coast of Indonesia.
[02:18:45.168 --> 02:18:50.392]  Fortunately, those gigantic earthquakes did not produce a devastating tsunami.
[02:18:50.392 --> 02:18:54.495]  But that doesn't mean that those earthquakes were not immensely powerful.
[02:18:54.495 --> 02:18:54.895]  There are over 440
[02:18:57.563 --> 02:18:59.725]  Nuclear reactors of industrial use.
[02:18:59.725 --> 02:19:04.349]  There's hundreds of experimental ones, two of them in Austin.
[02:19:04.349 --> 02:19:06.290]  People say those don't exist because it's too scary.
[02:19:06.290 --> 02:19:08.052]  Okay, okay, it doesn't exist.
[02:19:08.052 --> 02:19:09.333]  In North Austin, the J.J.
[02:19:09.333 --> 02:19:11.835]  Pickle Research Center.
[02:19:11.835 --> 02:19:15.638]  That's built directly on the Balcones fault line.
[02:19:15.638 --> 02:19:18.100]  And right down the street is a extinct volcano.
[02:19:18.100 --> 02:19:25.066]  I mean, I've looked at maps, it's like they go, oh, if it's the worst fault zone, the worst spot in Japan is Fukushima on the maps.
[02:19:26.164 --> 02:19:28.606]  And it gets hit by tsunamis.
[02:19:28.606 --> 02:19:31.027]  And how many nuclear reactors on the West Coast, guys?
[02:19:31.027 --> 02:19:32.428]  Look that factoid up.
[02:19:32.428 --> 02:19:33.208]  I think it's more than 30.
[02:19:33.208 --> 02:19:37.171]  Imagine if there's big earthquakes for those reactors.
[02:19:37.171 --> 02:19:40.153]  Well, they'll just blow up and rain down radiation on us.
[02:19:40.153 --> 02:19:43.034]  And our media will be like, go outside and breathe heavily.
[02:19:43.034 --> 02:19:45.296]  Radiation is now good for you.
[02:19:45.296 --> 02:19:46.677]  Your government loves you.
[02:19:46.677 --> 02:19:49.258]  And HBO is promoting pedophilia.
[02:19:49.258 --> 02:19:50.319]  But they say it's good.
[02:19:51.442 --> 02:19:54.227]  You know, I mean, it's just craziness.
[02:19:54.227 --> 02:19:56.271]  It's total craziness.
[02:19:56.271 --> 02:19:57.353]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:57.353 --> 02:19:57.854]  Stay with us.
[02:19:57.854 --> 02:19:58.615]  More news straight ahead.
[02:20:03.894 --> 02:20:08.378]  Folks, have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[02:20:08.378 --> 02:20:11.721]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[02:20:11.721 --> 02:20:16.105]  Because there's never been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead.
[02:20:16.105 --> 02:20:17.106]  Here's why.
[02:20:17.106 --> 02:20:23.251]  Solar power generators are now available from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[02:20:23.251 --> 02:20:28.115]  Their emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:20:28.115 --> 02:20:30.938]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly.
[02:20:33.399 --> 02:20:38.320]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:20:38.320 --> 02:20:44.262]  Whether it's ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:20:44.262 --> 02:20:49.884]  When the power goes out this winter, you'll be ready with a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.

[02:21:59.619 --> 02:22:06.062]  Do you know which 37 crucial food items are going to fly off the shelves when the next disaster hits?
[02:22:06.062 --> 02:22:12.464]  If you don't, you and your family may be without food and waiting in long food lines after a big disaster strikes!
[02:22:12.464 --> 02:22:17.286]  You wouldn't be surprised how many people don't have these food items right now!
[02:22:17.286 --> 02:22:20.847]  123SurvivalPlan.com has set up a For Patriots Only video
[02:22:21.287 --> 02:22:26.931]  Inside information on the 37 food items that will sell out first when the next disaster strikes.
[02:22:26.931 --> 02:22:36.136]  The video on 123survivalplan.com has crucial information you and your family need to prepare for any disaster, natural or man-made.
[02:22:36.136 --> 02:22:40.799]  And you won't have to be afraid of going hungry or being sent to a FEMA refugee camp.
[02:22:41.019 --> 02:22:46.424]  See the video that over one million other smart patriots have already seen in the last four months.
[02:22:46.424 --> 02:22:47.685]  Prepare now!
[02:22:47.685 --> 02:22:53.550]  Go to 123survivalplan.com and learn which 37 food items you should hoard.
[02:22:53.550 --> 02:22:54.331]  Easy to remember.
[02:22:54.331 --> 02:22:54.931]  123survivalplan.com.
[02:22:54.931 --> 02:22:56.673]  Again, that's 123survivalplan.com.
[02:23:03.598 --> 02:23:08.761]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[02:23:08.761 --> 02:23:10.642]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[02:23:10.642 --> 02:23:14.164]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with Fake TV.
[02:23:14.164 --> 02:23:18.646]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television.
[02:23:18.646 --> 02:23:21.648]  So from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[02:23:21.648 --> 02:23:26.150]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[02:23:26.150 --> 02:23:31.873]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[02:23:32.213 --> 02:23:34.014]  Use it anytime you're away from home.
[02:23:34.014 --> 02:23:40.118]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95, go to Faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[02:23:40.118 --> 02:23:44.541]  Each additional fake TV is only $29.95.
[02:23:44.541 --> 02:23:49.644]  So get one for you and one for a loved one for safety, security, and peace of mind for both of you.
[02:23:49.644 --> 02:23:55.367]  Call 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to Faketv.com.
[02:23:55.367 --> 02:23:58.309]  Faketv.com, the burglar deterrent.
[02:24:17.017 --> 02:24:21.681]  Alright, here's some of the headlines up at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:24:21.681 --> 02:24:22.482]  Big.
[02:24:22.482 --> 02:24:23.703]  Green.
[02:24:23.703 --> 02:24:24.543]  Oil.
[02:24:24.543 --> 02:24:26.405]  Money.
[02:24:26.405 --> 02:24:30.448]  WWF founded and run by Royal Dutch Shell.
[02:24:30.448 --> 02:24:42.338]  And Patrick Henningsen's article, that we'll show folks, goes through the evidence that the big oil companies are supporting the carbon tax.
[02:24:42.338 --> 02:24:43.439]  They're the ones pushing it.
[02:24:43.439 --> 02:24:44.740]  They're owned by the big mega banks.
[02:24:46.274 --> 02:24:51.357]  And again, if you look at the featured news area of Infowars.com, we have our video report up there.
[02:24:51.357 --> 02:24:59.043]  Infowars reporters harassed by cops for asking questions about Chicken Man and told that they couldn't enter the city council building.
[02:24:59.043 --> 02:25:07.628]  We've got a new development on that with them joining us here in just a moment.
[02:25:07.628 --> 02:25:09.930]  And then right here, we've got a big story.
[02:25:09.930 --> 02:25:12.652]  Bilderberg to pick Romney's puppet mate.
[02:25:14.867 --> 02:25:16.948]  And that is a big, big deal.
[02:25:16.948 --> 02:25:19.069]  There's more news on this today.
[02:25:19.069 --> 02:25:25.273]  But this isn't just about Bilderberg set to pick his running mate.
[02:25:25.273 --> 02:25:38.540]  It's the fact that the Washington Post, from the founding of Bilderberg back in 1954, in Oosterbeek, Holland, with the Dutch royalty and all the rest of them,
[02:25:41.263 --> 02:25:46.024]  Meeting there with the British Royalty and the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[02:25:46.024 --> 02:25:51.165]  The Washington Post has always had Jane Graham, the founder of it, owner of it, or then her son there.
[02:25:51.165 --> 02:25:53.405]  They never would talk about it.
[02:25:53.405 --> 02:25:54.626]  They were sworn to secrecy.
[02:25:54.626 --> 02:25:57.026]  The only media at first allowed in there.
[02:25:57.026 --> 02:26:04.488]  And now the Washington Post came out yesterday in an article, in the loop, shout at a dictator, get some VP cred.
[02:26:04.488 --> 02:26:09.089]  And they officially linked to the Bilderberg website that a few years ago was just nothing.
[02:26:09.089 --> 02:26:10.509]  Now they're going public.
[02:26:11.517 --> 02:26:13.197]  And that's what this is, is a coming out.
[02:26:13.197 --> 02:26:17.038]  And they say, yeah, he ought to pick this certain person.
[02:26:17.038 --> 02:26:18.819]  That's probably what Bilderberg would like.
[02:26:18.819 --> 02:26:21.700]  You know, a lot of people think Bilderberg is going to basically choose.
[02:26:21.700 --> 02:26:25.841]  Bilderberg's been involved helping choose running mates before, they say.
[02:26:25.841 --> 02:26:30.362]  So now, before it didn't exist, then when it did exist, it didn't have power.
[02:26:30.362 --> 02:26:32.822]  And now, oh yeah, it chooses.
[02:26:32.822 --> 02:26:40.044]  It's like in Europe, where in multiple countries, like Greece and Italy, Goldman Sachs publicly appoints the presidents and prime ministers now.
[02:26:41.215 --> 02:26:44.916]  And publicly says they've captured them.
[02:26:44.916 --> 02:26:53.539]  But because it's not a foreign government, or, you know, well, at least it's not a Rooski, or a Chycom, it's alright to have bankers conquer us.
[02:26:53.539 --> 02:26:59.800]  I mean, we've got to get our mind around that, that we've been conquered here.
[02:26:59.800 --> 02:27:06.902]  And in the article, they just mention, oh yeah, Bilderberg, you know, did put pressure on there to put John Edwards in as the running mate in 2004 of, um,
[02:27:11.863 --> 02:27:18.985]  Senator Kerry and Bilderberg does make a lot of decisions and well the question is, you know, Bilderberg kind of wants this person.
[02:27:18.985 --> 02:27:21.886]  It's like a public communique directly to Mitt Romney.
[02:27:21.886 --> 02:27:32.510]  A story in today's Washington Post written by veteran columnist Al Kamen suggests that the Bilderberg group may have a decisive role to play in picking Mitt Romney's running mate.
[02:27:34.045 --> 02:27:38.987]  Continuing a recent trend in which the secret of cabal has had a direct influence on U.S.
[02:27:38.987 --> 02:27:39.967]  presidential approach.
[02:27:39.967 --> 02:27:41.688]  But that's only part of it.
[02:27:41.688 --> 02:27:47.990]  Why are they now admitting they have an influence through their house org and the Washington Post?
[02:27:47.990 --> 02:27:51.511]  This is a big deal.
[02:27:51.511 --> 02:28:00.934]  Kamen has been writing for the Washington Post for over three decades and also worked with Watergate icons Woodward and Bernstein, suggesting the title of his column, In the Loop, has some meaning behind it.
[02:28:02.452 --> 02:28:03.793]  He's saying I'm part of the establishment.
[02:28:03.793 --> 02:28:05.494]  I've been told this.
[02:28:05.494 --> 02:28:08.516]  And it's a message to folks that are in the loop.
[02:28:08.516 --> 02:28:18.402]  Kamen remarks on how both President Obama and Hillary Clinton are heading to the Summit of the Americas this weekend in Columbia to meet with over 30 other heads of state.
[02:28:18.402 --> 02:28:26.608]  They will be joined by Senator Mark Rubio of Florida, who has been touted as a potential VP, having endorsed Mitt Romney last month.
[02:28:27.679 --> 02:28:30.901]  Curiously, not many senators seem to be going.
[02:28:30.901 --> 02:28:38.907]  In fact, it may be that the only one going for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is Mark Rubio, a possible vice presidential pick.
[02:28:38.907 --> 02:28:46.392]  By the way, Jim Tucker said, well it was actually Mark Anderson with him, that they were looking at it could be at this meeting.
[02:28:46.392 --> 02:28:52.937]  Because they'll have Bilderberg steering meetings that aren't the official meeting, but they'll get together and have piggyback meetings at these other global meetings.
[02:28:54.468 --> 02:29:01.411]  She goes on to say, a possible vice presidential pick who we're told is flying commercial to attend, writes Kamen.
[02:29:01.411 --> 02:29:12.976]  Adding that Rubio's presence could help boost his foreign policy chops, just as a visit with the clandestine Bilderberg group was key in John Edwards being picked as John Kerry's number two in 04.
[02:29:12.976 --> 02:29:15.697]  I thought it didn't exist.
[02:29:15.697 --> 02:29:17.898]  I thought I was a crazy man.
[02:29:17.898 --> 02:29:20.179]  I thought the New York Times just four years ago
[02:29:21.195 --> 02:29:27.237]  Had an article saying I was having hallucinations in Virginia and imagining people following me.
[02:29:27.237 --> 02:29:40.021]  Yeah, helicopters, motorcades, machine guns, Marines in plain clothes, people trying to set us up, police arresting people, world leaders, on-site, no media coverage, except that I'm insane.
[02:29:40.021 --> 02:29:41.262]  No, I'm not insane.
[02:29:41.262 --> 02:29:48.064]  You thought the people were insanely stupid and that you could con them, and now you've been caught with your pants down, Washington Post!
[02:29:50.407 --> 02:29:54.329]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.329 --> 02:30:02.252]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:31:55.318 --> 02:32:05.103]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:05.103 --> 02:32:09.445]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:09.445 --> 02:32:15.188]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:15.188 --> 02:32:20.471]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:20.791 --> 02:32:21.612]  Number 3.
[02:32:21.612 --> 02:32:25.195]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:25.195 --> 02:32:29.119]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:29.119 --> 02:32:29.919]  Number 4.
[02:32:29.919 --> 02:32:32.682]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:32.682 --> 02:32:36.365]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:36.365 --> 02:32:37.166]  Number 5.
[02:32:37.166 --> 02:32:41.290]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:41.290 --> 02:32:46.054]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:46.334 --> 02:32:50.497]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:32:59.543 --> 02:33:11.452]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:33.925 --> 02:33:44.029]  Well, Mr. Wordy's died when the establishment came and took his little farm home of just two and a half acres or so.
[02:33:44.029 --> 02:33:49.611]  He was legally raising chickens, and he'd beaten them in court over and over again since 2008.
[02:33:51.923 --> 02:33:59.406]  And I was reading they couldn't get the local sheriff involved, so somehow the feds were involved, and there was an explosion, and he's dead.
[02:33:59.406 --> 02:34:05.848]  And yesterday, Darren McBreen and our other great reporter and researcher, Marcos Morales, arrived there.
[02:34:05.848 --> 02:34:19.073]  They arrived there the evening before, and they went to the city hall that looks like it's a Capitol building or something, it's so large, and were told by the police, yelled at, and told, you cannot, and we have footage of this,
[02:34:20.225 --> 02:34:24.468]  You cannot go in the city council building in broad daylight.
[02:34:24.468 --> 02:34:31.473]  I think it was like noontime or so as they were on the show right after it happened and we have that high def footage they shot there on the ground.
[02:34:31.473 --> 02:34:32.474]  They're getting back tonight.
[02:34:32.474 --> 02:34:37.337]  We'll have it for you on the radio slash TV and the nightly news on Monday.
[02:34:37.337 --> 02:34:40.739]  And the police first got in their face and turn your cameras off.
[02:34:40.739 --> 02:34:41.420]  You're bad.
[02:34:41.420 --> 02:34:43.121]  You're not real media.
[02:34:43.121 --> 02:34:44.682]  And my guys are like First Amendment.
[02:34:44.682 --> 02:34:47.204]  We're just going inside very polite.
[02:34:47.204 --> 02:34:48.525]  They said you're not allowed to go in the building.
[02:34:49.906 --> 02:35:10.511]  Well now there's been a new twist, and while Darren was getting ready for this live feed from an iPhone via Skype, there in Roswell, Georgia, the site of Agenda 21 death and destruction, as we document and chronicle Agenda 21 green zoning, because they were taking his land to make it a green zone,
[02:35:12.697 --> 02:35:15.218]  And of course, other land that they've been taking.
[02:35:15.218 --> 02:35:17.819]  This was just the tail end piece they needed.
[02:35:17.819 --> 02:35:19.560]  But now it's not going to be a park, they've announced.
[02:35:19.560 --> 02:35:22.982]  They're deciding to just sell it to some friends, of course.
[02:35:22.982 --> 02:35:24.062]  That's how it works.
[02:35:24.062 --> 02:35:26.543]  Usually they don't even build the park.
[02:35:26.543 --> 02:35:28.784]  They're like, we're taking your neighbor's land for a park.
[02:35:28.784 --> 02:35:30.025]  The neighbor's like, oh, I want that.
[02:35:30.845 --> 02:35:32.126]  Then later, well, where's my park?
[02:35:32.126 --> 02:35:33.887]  You don't get that, stupid.
[02:35:33.887 --> 02:35:36.008]  We're gonna build a high-rise on it now.
[02:35:36.008 --> 02:35:43.031]  But the point is, the police said you can't go in the city council headquarters public building.
[02:35:43.031 --> 02:35:52.657]  So I told them, I said, I want you to go back down there tomorrow, and if you choose to violate their unlawful order, and you choose to get arrested, I will sue them.
[02:35:52.657 --> 02:35:53.977]  I will pay to sue them.
[02:35:53.977 --> 02:35:55.018]  But I said, don't resist.
[02:35:57.228 --> 02:35:57.889]  Obviously.
[02:35:57.889 --> 02:35:59.990]  And I said, and don't go in if you don't want to get arrested.
[02:35:59.990 --> 02:36:02.112]  Well, they backed off.
[02:36:02.112 --> 02:36:12.281]  Now, as we were waiting to go live here during the last three minute break, Darren McBreen was standing in front of the City Hall and two police cars pull up behind him.
[02:36:12.281 --> 02:36:16.444]  So they're in the shot right now, keeping an eye on the dangerous reporter.
[02:36:16.444 --> 02:36:18.145]  But there's been a new twist.
[02:36:18.145 --> 02:36:20.427]  And Darren McBreen will tell us about that.
[02:36:20.427 --> 02:36:22.029]  Darren, thank you for joining us, sir.
[02:36:23.527 --> 02:36:26.150]  Well, Alex, what a difference a day makes.
[02:36:26.150 --> 02:36:28.452]  You know, yesterday, like I said, we were harassed.
[02:36:28.452 --> 02:36:32.576]  We actually called the community relations spokesperson today.
[02:36:32.576 --> 02:36:35.398]  Her name is Julie Recbell.
[02:36:35.398 --> 02:36:42.565]  And, you know, we told her that we would be returning to City Hall today and asked her if, you know, we should expect harassment by the police.
[02:36:43.326 --> 02:36:45.507]  Basically, today it's a different story.
[02:36:45.507 --> 02:36:47.527]  You know, they rolled out the welcome wagon.
[02:36:47.527 --> 02:36:49.208]  She invited us into the building.
[02:36:49.208 --> 02:36:54.029]  She even was gracious enough to participate in an interview.
[02:36:54.029 --> 02:36:58.790]  But nobody is talking about the case of Andrew Wardace.
[02:36:58.790 --> 02:36:59.630]  Not a single person.
[02:36:59.630 --> 02:37:02.811]  In fact, we're even told that, you know, the mayor
[02:37:03.531 --> 02:37:03.931]  Oh, really?
[02:37:03.931 --> 02:37:05.132]  Not going to talk about the topic again?
[02:37:05.132 --> 02:37:06.853]  That's what Congressman Weiner said early on.
[02:37:29.013 --> 02:37:32.094]  Yeah, so nobody's answering questions.
[02:37:32.094 --> 02:37:42.598]  It's very odd, you know, and when you rush up the steps with a microphone and a camera, it's just strange, you know, yesterday to be surrounded by police.
[02:37:42.598 --> 02:37:47.180]  You know, it felt like one of those fictitious suburban towns in the Twilight Zone.
[02:37:47.180 --> 02:37:48.521]  I couldn't believe it.
[02:37:48.521 --> 02:37:50.562]  But like I said, today it's a different story.
[02:37:50.562 --> 02:37:54.983]  It might have to do with the fact that we were told that there's nobody in the City Council that's even here today.
[02:37:54.983 --> 02:37:57.865]  The mayor's not here, nobody's here, so maybe it's because there's nobody.
[02:37:57.865 --> 02:37:58.805]  Yeah, no, that's the twist.
[02:37:58.865 --> 02:37:59.845]  Yes, they were all there.
[02:37:59.845 --> 02:38:07.048]  Marcos had gone in before you to make sure it was the right building, there in the sprawling government complex, feeding on the public.
[02:38:07.048 --> 02:38:10.469]  And then she threw him out and said, no, just leave.
[02:38:10.469 --> 02:38:12.589]  You try to come in, they block you.
[02:38:12.589 --> 02:38:15.390]  And then now today you were saying it was a ghost town in there.
[02:38:15.390 --> 02:38:21.372]  So, oh, go ahead, come on in now, because you can't talk to anybody, because they're all off playing golf or something.
[02:38:22.915 --> 02:38:34.800]  Yeah, and you know, and I think they're fully aware by now that we are, you know, very knowledgeable of our rights, you know, so they know that we're not gonna be budged, you know, and I think that's important for everybody to know.
[02:38:34.800 --> 02:38:39.842]  If you know your rights, you're protected, but if you don't, you know, they will jump all over you.
[02:38:39.842 --> 02:38:43.964]  I mean, they will take advantage of that fact, so it's really rule by consent.
[02:38:45.746 --> 02:38:46.386]  It is.
[02:38:46.386 --> 02:38:51.128]  Now, you've talked to more people trying to investigate Mr. Wertes' death.
[02:38:51.128 --> 02:38:56.750]  And again, we have a report last night, you followed the nightly news, the June 21 green kiss of death.
[02:38:56.750 --> 02:38:59.811]  But what are we learning now about the way he died?
[02:38:59.811 --> 02:39:01.752]  Is there any further investigation?
[02:39:01.752 --> 02:39:13.156]  I know there's conflicting news reports because nobody's talking now that some of the police refused to take part in the raid against the evil chicken farmer.
[02:39:14.642 --> 02:39:20.425]  You know, I think the strangest thing is that we actually have more questions now than we did when we first got here.
[02:39:20.425 --> 02:39:22.667]  You know, it's just that nobody is talking.
[02:39:22.667 --> 02:39:32.072]  You know, there has been some people that, some police that have told us that they refused, that they didn't want to participate, but that they didn't want to talk on camera.
[02:39:32.072 --> 02:39:33.693]  We're trying to get Sheriff Jackson.
[02:39:33.693 --> 02:39:37.716]  We're trying to get his, you know, what he thinks about all this.
[02:39:37.716 --> 02:39:39.337]  We're told that he might talk to us.
[02:39:39.337 --> 02:39:40.577]  I talked to his secretary.
[02:39:40.577 --> 02:39:41.418]  No phone calls back.
[02:39:43.018 --> 02:39:45.662]  Now I know you've tried to talk to some of the journalists and others.
[02:39:45.662 --> 02:39:46.644]  What are locals saying?
[02:39:46.644 --> 02:39:48.206]  Do we do we know anything?
[02:39:48.206 --> 02:39:56.819]  It's just the house blows up when there's a raid and they say we we think he committed suicide and then we get there and they're acting all suspicious.
[02:39:56.819 --> 02:39:58.882]  Yeah I think the locals they
[02:40:00.179 --> 02:40:00.359]  To the
[02:40:18.632 --> 02:40:22.796]  You know, refused to maintain the sewage and the drain.
[02:40:22.796 --> 02:40:25.459]  Why won't the mayor talk to you then?
[02:40:25.459 --> 02:40:30.163]  Because I know, I mean, I know reportedly he's not the kingpin in all this and was friends with him.
[02:40:30.163 --> 02:40:32.165]  So it's the code enforcement people?
[02:40:32.165 --> 02:40:38.131]  You know, over and over again, it's like the mayor, the police chief, they just do whatever these bureaucrats tell them.
[02:40:38.131 --> 02:40:38.772]  Look, the mayor...
[02:40:39.580 --> 02:40:46.502]  Issued an official press conference, and like I said, I believe it was at Andrew Warder's funeral.
[02:40:46.502 --> 02:40:48.663]  And he informed the public that this is it.
[02:40:48.663 --> 02:40:50.664]  This is the last time we're talking about this.
[02:40:50.664 --> 02:40:56.386]  So any questions that the media has on this case, they are just simply referring everyone
[02:40:56.966 --> 02:41:15.345]  to the mayor's official press conference which I haven't seen or read but I can assure you as soon as we get to a computer we'll check that out but they just they don't want to talk to anybody and it's not just Infowars.com it's all the rest of the media as well but obviously we're the only ones that are pressing the issue they just do their jobs by remaining silent
[02:41:16.240 --> 02:41:23.386]  Darren, let's expand on this, because I know as soon as we disconnect from you, you're going to remember a bunch of stuff you wanted to cover.
[02:41:23.386 --> 02:41:27.349]  But bottom line, this is death by bureaucrat.
[02:41:27.349 --> 02:41:34.655]  I mean, are they saying now how he blew himself up, or why they think he blew himself up, or who was involved?
[02:41:34.655 --> 02:41:37.097]  Because I'm told feds were involved, that the
[02:41:38.018 --> 02:41:41.099]  Police department was involved, that the sheriff wouldn't be involved.
[02:41:41.099 --> 02:41:42.700]  That's in one news article.
[02:41:42.700 --> 02:41:46.481]  Other articles say the police wouldn't be involved, and it was constables.
[02:41:46.481 --> 02:41:48.762]  Others say it was federal environmental police.
[02:41:48.762 --> 02:41:50.603]  Who raided the house?
[02:41:50.603 --> 02:41:52.764]  We were told that it was county marshals.
[02:41:52.764 --> 02:41:53.864]  That's it.
[02:41:53.864 --> 02:41:54.965]  They were the only ones.
[02:41:54.965 --> 02:41:56.705]  There was no police department.
[02:41:56.705 --> 02:41:59.026]  So it was county marshals.
[02:41:59.026 --> 02:42:04.909]  They did, and this is not official, but I've also heard reports that they did find a detonation device.
[02:42:06.755 --> 02:42:07.196]  We're good to go.
[02:42:27.037 --> 02:42:30.539]  It looked much more devastating on the inside than it did the outside.
[02:42:30.539 --> 02:42:36.081]  You could see damage, you could see the burn from the outside, but inside is completely gutted and burnt to a crisp.
[02:42:36.081 --> 02:42:47.506]  I've got news camera footage from squad cars across the country where they'll get into somebody's RV and go, look we found pipe bomb parts and they'll hold up jumper cables.
[02:42:48.466 --> 02:43:07.235]  Um, that happened in a case of a fellow I actually personally know, and it had the squad car footage and the helicopter footage, but later in the trial, the squad car footage, and he gets out, uh, what Farrell Montgomery's his name, there's actually a clip of it in Road to Tyranny, and is it Road to Tyranny or is it Masters of Terror?
[02:43:07.235 --> 02:43:07.696]  I forget.
[02:43:07.696 --> 02:43:13.979]  The point is, he gets out of his little RV, they taser him, they let the police dog bite him for no reason,
[02:43:15.054 --> 02:43:19.137]  And then they go on the news and say, we're arresting him for a pipe bomb.
[02:43:19.137 --> 02:43:20.859]  And they hold up jumper cables.
[02:43:20.859 --> 02:43:21.879]  And then later they had to drop it.
[02:43:21.879 --> 02:43:23.741]  And it's just like, you know, who knows?
[02:43:23.741 --> 02:43:24.241]  That's the thing.
[02:43:24.241 --> 02:43:28.304]  When government lies this much, I don't know if I believe anything they say, Darren.
[02:43:28.304 --> 02:43:39.433]  It's like NASA says they've 99% proven Martian bacteria in the samples from the Viking spacecraft that landed there in 76.
[02:43:39.433 --> 02:43:40.394]  I don't know if that's true.
[02:43:40.394 --> 02:43:41.835]  I mean, you can't believe anything they say.
[02:43:43.325 --> 02:43:48.808]  Well, and the strangest thing, too, we have a community spokesperson who isn't speaking.
[02:43:48.808 --> 02:43:51.710]  I mean, you know, she talked to us, she invited us in today.
[02:43:51.710 --> 02:43:54.172]  Yesterday, she sent the police after us.
[02:43:54.172 --> 02:43:58.394]  But today, you know, we're invited in, but still none of our questions were answered.
[02:43:58.394 --> 02:44:01.976]  Did you ask her why she sent the police after you yesterday?
[02:44:01.976 --> 02:44:03.437]  Yes, she said she did not.
[02:44:03.437 --> 02:44:04.278]  She did not.
[02:44:04.278 --> 02:44:09.561]  So, and she also said today that it was wrong for them to tell us to leave.
[02:44:09.561 --> 02:44:11.442]  You know, so today she's on our side.
[02:44:11.442 --> 02:44:13.023]  Yesterday, it was a twilight zone.
[02:44:15.319 --> 02:44:18.141]  Well, again, I want to ask police something and these bureaucrats.
[02:44:18.141 --> 02:44:31.389]  Do you really want your kids growing up in a country like this, where journalists show up in suits and ties and are walking up and police jump out and yell at them and say you can't go in the city hall?
[02:44:31.389 --> 02:44:34.952]  I mean, that is an unlawful thing they did.
[02:44:34.952 --> 02:44:37.053]  And this is happening everywhere.
[02:44:37.053 --> 02:44:41.316]  And I gave the analogy yesterday, Darren, I want your take on this.
[02:44:41.316 --> 02:44:44.478]  It'd be like if you owned a bass boat with your neighbor.
[02:44:45.971 --> 02:44:53.278]  And you're out on the bass boat and, you know, the neighbor happens to be a cop and they shoot a hole in the bottom of the boat and say, aha, I'm sinking your boat.
[02:44:53.278 --> 02:44:54.719]  You're like, but it's your boat, too.
[02:44:54.719 --> 02:44:55.840]  You're in it, too.
[02:44:55.840 --> 02:45:04.829]  I mean, when you butcher the Bill of Rights and Constitution that you swore an oath to protect and defend, by the way, there's a reason that's what our oaths do, you're destroying your own future.
[02:45:04.829 --> 02:45:08.011]  And there's all these excuses of, oh, that's the way it is.
[02:45:09.706 --> 02:45:13.659]  And of course, they demoralized the police because it is a thankless, horrible job.
[02:45:13.659 --> 02:45:14.963]  I mean, you couldn't pay me $500,000 to do it.
[02:45:17.243 --> 02:45:28.706]  Uh, and I know some cops now pay over $100,000 in many areas, but still, I mean, it, it, it, after a while, it, it sounds, but, so, I mean, look, this country didn't used to have police.
[02:45:28.706 --> 02:45:35.467]  You had sheriffs and others for serious crimes or to get warrants after a crime was committed to bring somebody to justice.
[02:45:35.467 --> 02:45:37.488]  Now you got everybody calling the police on each other.
[02:45:37.488 --> 02:45:40.188]  They're dog poops in their yard.
[02:45:40.188 --> 02:45:42.089]  You know, that's not what police are for, Darren.
[02:45:43.757 --> 02:45:45.398]  Or if you have too many chickens.
[02:45:45.398 --> 02:45:46.498]  But we don't know if that's true.
[02:45:46.498 --> 02:45:51.881]  You know, they claimed that one of Andrew's neighbors did not like his number of chickens.
[02:45:51.881 --> 02:45:52.981]  And you know, it's just silly.
[02:45:52.981 --> 02:45:54.922]  I mean, Andrew, we've seen his property.
[02:45:54.922 --> 02:45:57.043]  He kept it up to code.
[02:45:57.043 --> 02:45:58.323]  You know, the place looked great.
[02:45:58.323 --> 02:46:03.766]  And from what we understand, he was actually the official on raising chickens.
[02:46:04.491 --> 02:46:16.755]  He would teach other people how to do it, but according to the City Hall here, someone complained, and then he had, oh God forbid, he had too many chickens on his property.
[02:46:16.755 --> 02:46:21.056]  Well, he's dead now, so they must feel good about themselves.
[02:46:21.056 --> 02:46:27.178]  And he dared to borrow a tractor from the mayor and grade his own property to protect his property from flooding.
[02:46:29.079 --> 02:46:32.781]  You know, my grandfather had a heart attack that ended up basically killing him a few years later.
[02:46:32.781 --> 02:46:38.204]  Might as well have been dead because of the heart attack and then the heart surgery and then the stroke it caused.
[02:46:38.204 --> 02:46:45.248]  But I remember he was getting these $2,000 a day fines because they've got actuaries in Austin where they only hit old people, I've noticed.
[02:46:46.324 --> 02:46:55.471]  Uh, and because I was doing these stories myself and they didn't have cable, but they heard from the neighbor about my story and my grandfather's like in a little blue collar area of South Austin.
[02:46:55.471 --> 02:46:56.852]  My grandmother still lives there.
[02:46:56.852 --> 02:47:01.756]  He goes, my mom's dad, he goes, Alex, I'm getting these $2,000 a day fines.
[02:47:01.756 --> 02:47:03.397]  They say I've got to clean out the creek.
[02:47:04.258 --> 02:47:16.786]  But he goes, here's my property line and the city is, and of course he was smart and informed unlike most people who they prey on, he goes, he goes, can you do something about this or do I go to the city council?
[02:47:16.786 --> 02:47:22.970]  Because that's not my property, that's a drainage ditch off the road and I'm not supposed to keep that clear, the city is.
[02:47:24.468 --> 02:47:27.449]  And I said, well, sure, I'll do something about it.
[02:47:27.449 --> 02:47:29.890]  And but I left that day.
[02:47:29.890 --> 02:47:30.650]  It was a Sunday.
[02:47:30.650 --> 02:47:33.472]  I should go there and eat Sunday evenings, eat dinner with my grandparents.
[02:47:33.472 --> 02:47:35.432]  And I watched 60 Minutes with him.
[02:47:35.432 --> 02:47:36.373]  And a few days later.
[02:47:39.116 --> 02:47:43.301]  A few days later, I go, yeah, I'm gonna just hire a company to come do it.
[02:47:43.301 --> 02:47:45.083]  It's quicker than fighting the city.
[02:47:45.083 --> 02:47:47.405]  And she's like, my grandma's like, oh, he's already been out there all day.
[02:47:47.405 --> 02:47:51.289]  He was like 77 years old, a little bit overweight and stuff.
[02:47:51.289 --> 02:47:57.596]  He's been out there all day cleaning out all the brush and stuff that had gotten in there that the code enforcers were telling him he had to clean that wasn't even his brush.
[02:47:58.357 --> 02:48:00.759]  And then a couple days later he had a heart attack and I think that's part of it.
[02:48:00.759 --> 02:48:02.940]  Probably broke some, you know, plaque loose and did that.
[02:48:02.940 --> 02:48:07.442]  But that's how they operate and that's what they do.
[02:48:07.442 --> 02:48:11.125]  And I saw them giving people $2,000 a day fines for three inch grass.
[02:48:11.125 --> 02:48:13.906]  And it was always when somebody wanted their property we'd fine.
[02:48:13.906 --> 02:48:16.648]  It was always cancer patients, people like that.
[02:48:16.648 --> 02:48:22.711]  So I just want to show the city council people with three foot grass in the city and demanded they have criminal charges on them.
[02:48:23.672 --> 02:48:26.075]  I was actually told that by a police officer.
[02:48:26.075 --> 02:48:32.323]  The police started giving me all the data on the city council people who had who had code violations because they didn't like going.
[02:48:32.323 --> 02:48:33.484]  Oh, because that was the thing.
[02:48:33.484 --> 02:48:41.233]  They were ordered with Roland Ellingson to go arrest him because he hadn't paid the fines.
[02:48:41.233 --> 02:48:42.074]  Anyway, shot issue.
[02:48:42.074 --> 02:48:42.936]  Anything else, McBrain?
[02:48:44.062 --> 02:48:50.167]  No, and like I said Alex, you know, it's just very tragic and we're left here with more questions than we even began with.
[02:48:50.167 --> 02:48:54.990]  There's some very shady dealings in the background going on with the foreclosure.
[02:48:54.990 --> 02:48:56.812]  You know, we're going to look more into that.
[02:48:56.812 --> 02:48:59.654]  Very suspicious, you know, things going on there.
[02:48:59.654 --> 02:49:04.417]  So we're trying to talk to his attorney who is helping him with the, try to fight the foreclosure.
[02:49:04.417 --> 02:49:06.019]  So maybe we'll have an update on you on that.
[02:49:06.587 --> 02:49:09.067]  You know, Darren, I was thinking... Later this afternoon.
[02:49:09.067 --> 02:49:09.768]  Thank you, Darren.
[02:49:09.768 --> 02:49:12.828]  I was thinking earlier that maybe it was a smaller town.
[02:49:12.828 --> 02:49:16.229]  It was like a little city council that maybe they close sometimes.
[02:49:16.229 --> 02:49:19.449]  That looks like the Tennessee Capitol or something.
[02:49:19.449 --> 02:49:24.170]  This must be a really big town and with giant steps leading up to it.
[02:49:24.170 --> 02:49:28.371]  And they were telling you you couldn't go in that public mausoleum?
[02:49:28.371 --> 02:49:31.892]  Well, it's, what is it, what, a 40-minute drive from Atlanta?
[02:49:31.892 --> 02:49:32.672]  But, you know, there's...
[02:49:33.818 --> 02:49:34.558]  You really can't tell.
[02:49:34.558 --> 02:49:37.799]  It seems like a big town to me.
[02:49:37.799 --> 02:49:41.721]  That looks like a bigger city council than Austin has.
[02:49:41.721 --> 02:49:43.461]  It's a gigantic building.
[02:49:43.461 --> 02:49:44.762]  It's pretty big.
[02:49:44.762 --> 02:49:50.664]  Can you have Marcos Pan and show people a bigger shot of it?
[02:49:52.065 --> 02:49:52.805]  All right.
[02:49:52.805 --> 02:49:54.406]  We're going to pan to City Hall.
[02:49:54.406 --> 02:49:56.667]  Hey, great job, Darren and Marcos.
[02:49:56.667 --> 02:49:59.548]  We'll get more reports from you this evening and back next week.
[02:49:59.548 --> 02:50:03.129]  And, you know, it's an important case of government-run wild.
[02:50:03.129 --> 02:50:04.289]  And it is agenda 21.
[02:50:04.289 --> 02:50:06.850]  It was designated to be an environmental zone.
[02:50:06.850 --> 02:50:08.731]  And they, well, he's dead now.
[02:50:08.731 --> 02:50:10.851]  So they, I guess they're going to get their property.
[02:50:10.851 --> 02:50:12.012]  And so there is that report.
[02:50:12.012 --> 02:50:14.573]  I'm going to come back and go to Jenny.
[02:50:15.700 --> 02:50:18.081]  And jam in a call from Thomas and others.
[02:50:18.081 --> 02:50:23.284]  We'll do a little bit of overdrive to make sure I at least get to the five newest calls or oldest calls.
[02:50:23.284 --> 02:50:28.107]  Russell, Thomas, Jenny, John, Marie, we'll get to all of you after this quick break.
[02:50:28.107 --> 02:50:36.031]  But look, it is the American system to dislike big government and mistrust it.
[02:50:36.031 --> 02:50:39.353]  The minute you start loving big government, you're going to live in North Korea.
[02:50:39.353 --> 02:50:40.334]  I mean, it's that simple.
[02:50:42.483 --> 02:50:46.748]  And by the way, we were interrupting each other because his Skype's delayed by about a second.
[02:50:46.748 --> 02:50:55.879]  And so it was, it was, but still incredible technology on the ground with an iPhone and a microphone communicating to us from thousands of miles away.
[02:50:55.879 --> 02:50:56.780]  Incredible.
[02:50:56.780 --> 02:50:58.602]  And that's InfoWars News.
[02:50:58.602 --> 02:50:59.043]  Stay with us.
[02:51:01.488 --> 02:51:08.631]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[02:51:08.631 --> 02:51:26.060]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:51:26.340 --> 02:51:32.465]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[02:51:32.465 --> 02:51:40.571]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[02:52:04.042 --> 02:52:06.103]  But what about when the food runs out?
[02:52:06.103 --> 02:52:06.503]  What then?

[02:53:54.713 --> 02:53:59.297]  I really can't get over the fact that HBO is now having pedophilia on television like it's cute.
[02:54:16.192 --> 02:54:18.273]  That report is at InfoWars.com.
[02:54:18.273 --> 02:54:26.417]  Kurt Nemo's got one coming out dealing with the fact that torture has been legalized in the United States just under a new name.
[02:54:26.417 --> 02:54:36.322]  So watch InfoWars.com for that to come out in the next hour or so and tying it into the proliferation of this.
[02:54:36.322 --> 02:54:38.604]  Right now, let's go back to your phone calls.
[02:54:38.604 --> 02:54:41.845]  Jenny in New York, welcome.
[02:54:41.845 --> 02:54:42.646]  Hello, Alex.
[02:54:44.734 --> 02:54:53.057]  Um, I have personally known about the establishment since I was 7 years old because they used to test on me with their drugs.
[02:54:53.057 --> 02:55:05.603]  And I actually was compliant about it until 2003 when I wanted to fight back because the state of New York wanted to take my son away from me because of my mental illness.
[02:55:05.603 --> 02:55:13.966]  So, I filed a petition in my county court and my ex-husband's wife counter-petitioned me.
[02:55:15.132 --> 02:55:22.299]  And ended up winning with the power of attorney and she signed his name, my ex-husband's name.
[02:55:22.299 --> 02:55:27.024]  So neither me or my ex-husband ever signed the adoption paperwork.
[02:55:27.024 --> 02:55:28.866]  So the adoption's only signed by her.
[02:55:31.394 --> 02:55:33.895]  Yeah, well, there's all sorts of stuff out there like that.
[02:55:33.895 --> 02:55:36.476]  That doesn't sound like that's legal or lawful.
[02:55:36.476 --> 02:55:37.736]  Thank you so much for the call.
[02:55:37.736 --> 02:55:43.118]  Another terrible story there as society degenerates and disintegrates.
[02:55:43.118 --> 02:55:44.018]  And it really is.
[02:55:44.018 --> 02:55:45.178]  Everybody knows that's the case.
[02:55:45.178 --> 02:55:49.539]  We need to repent and turn from our wicked ways, myself included.
[02:55:49.539 --> 02:55:53.461]  And even if you're not a Christian, I just mean, we've got to recognize good from evil.
[02:55:53.461 --> 02:55:54.641]  I mean, come on.
[02:55:54.641 --> 02:55:56.702]  Thomas in Kansas, you're on the air.
[02:55:56.702 --> 02:55:58.122]  Welcome.
[02:55:58.122 --> 02:55:58.802]  Hey, Alex.
[02:55:58.802 --> 02:55:59.963]  What's going on, man?
[02:55:59.963 --> 02:56:00.963]  Worldwide transmission.
[02:56:01.806 --> 02:56:04.948]  Long time listener, thanks for taking my call.
[02:56:04.948 --> 02:56:28.179]  I was actually at work yesterday, and I picked up the Kansas City Star, and on the front page, actually, was an article on how the Department of Justice is suing Apple for, I don't know, conspiring with publishers for making their e-books at a higher price.
[02:56:28.179 --> 02:56:29.220]  What is illegal about that?
[02:56:32.543 --> 02:56:33.864]  Well, that's what they always do.
[02:56:33.864 --> 02:56:35.705]  I did see the Justice Department.
[02:56:35.705 --> 02:56:39.026]  That's like having Beelzebub go after a smaller demon.
[02:56:39.026 --> 02:56:46.270]  I did see where they're going after Apple for trying to work with distributors to have a higher price.
[02:56:46.270 --> 02:56:55.495]  Amazon, you know, basically acts like Walmart and drives down the price, which actually just destroys publishers and smaller companies and makes them huge profits.
[02:56:55.495 --> 02:56:56.815]  It's all part of monopolies.
[02:56:56.815 --> 02:57:00.617]  I'm no fan of Apple and its overall business practices, but
[02:57:01.838 --> 02:57:16.089]  I don't think that's illegal, but I'm not an antitrust expert, but in general terms, they're always going after some little petty thing to act like they're doing something while ignoring the larger big crimes.
[02:57:16.089 --> 02:57:29.379]  Well, the interesting thing is, you know, it was headed up by Eric Holder, and it's just amazing to me that he would, just like you say, do something petty like this, which isn't petty for Apple, but
[02:57:30.273 --> 02:57:38.562]  You know, this is what creates, like, the lobbying for, you know, corporations to just throw a bunch of money in government to get them to leave them alone.
[02:57:38.562 --> 02:57:46.590]  Sure, but, uh, refreshing my memory, I think it was Apple and Kindle being sued for working together to drive down the price.
[02:57:46.590 --> 02:57:48.112]  You're saying it was to drive up the price?
[02:57:49.028 --> 02:57:50.709]  Well, here's what the article said.
[02:57:50.709 --> 02:58:06.275]  The article basically said that, okay, the Department of Justice was accusing Apple and the publishers of conspiring together, of driving up the price of e-books because publishers wanted more money from e-books.
[02:58:06.275 --> 02:58:12.437]  And so they were going to drop their e-books for Amazon and just go with Apple.
[02:58:13.257 --> 02:58:14.277]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[02:58:14.277 --> 02:58:22.982]  You know, I scanned over the article, and it just, it's not that important to me in the larger scheme, because it's like polishing, well, polishing a you-know-what.
[02:58:22.982 --> 02:58:26.023]  It just, in the final equation, it really doesn't matter.
[02:58:26.023 --> 02:58:29.805]  I mean, the Justice Department is a joke.
[02:58:29.805 --> 02:58:34.607]  And it only puts on appearances that it's trying to stop crime and things like that.
[02:58:34.607 --> 02:58:36.848]  Okay, another hour coming up.
[02:58:36.848 --> 02:58:37.729]  Straight ahead.
[02:58:37.729 --> 02:58:38.309]  Stay with us.

[03:00:10.342 --> 03:00:12.644]  Don't forget, I'll be back this Sunday, 4-6pm.
[03:00:12.644 --> 03:00:15.005]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[03:00:15.005 --> 03:00:17.947]  On this Friday the 13th, Transmission.
[03:00:17.947 --> 03:00:21.149]  Let's go to Russell in Texas, then John and Marie.
[03:00:21.149 --> 03:00:22.090]  Russell, you're on the air.
[03:00:22.090 --> 03:00:24.111]  How you doing, Alex?
[03:00:24.111 --> 03:00:24.211]  Good.
[03:00:24.211 --> 03:00:26.592]  Okay, Alex, I'm going to cover some topics here.
[03:00:26.592 --> 03:00:29.134]  First of all, I'm just going to say, Candy Tangerine is a winner.
[03:00:29.134 --> 03:00:29.975]  You're absolutely right.
[03:00:29.975 --> 03:00:33.917]  Now, I'm going to cover Jim Humble, MMS, Tom Leppert.
[03:00:35.632 --> 03:00:35.692]  No.
[03:00:35.692 --> 03:00:39.214]  I understand, but you won't get to all your points if you don't move quick.
[03:00:39.214 --> 03:00:41.256]  Go to the next point.
[03:01:03.140 --> 03:01:04.660]  I'm going to move real quick here.
[03:01:04.660 --> 03:01:08.261]  Multimerical supplement kills all viruses and bacteria in your body.
[03:01:08.261 --> 03:01:10.402]  It's been used for a long time.
[03:01:10.402 --> 03:01:13.503]  It's a surveyor that was prospecting for cold.
[03:01:13.503 --> 03:01:16.744]  Two guys are about ready to die from malaria.
[03:01:16.744 --> 03:01:19.644]  And he discovered this from water pills.
[03:01:19.644 --> 03:01:20.265]  Look it up.
[03:01:20.265 --> 03:01:21.925]  It kills all viruses in your body.
[03:01:21.925 --> 03:01:22.865]  Thank you for the call, sir.
[03:01:22.865 --> 03:01:23.485]  I appreciate it.
[03:01:23.485 --> 03:01:25.926]  We just don't have time to get to the other points now.
[03:01:25.926 --> 03:01:28.007]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Texas.
[03:01:28.007 --> 03:01:28.727]  John, you're on the air.
[03:01:30.222 --> 03:01:31.043]  Hey, Alex.
[03:01:31.043 --> 03:01:31.323]  Hey, buddy.
[03:01:31.323 --> 03:01:32.624]  This is John here in Austin, Texas.
[03:01:32.624 --> 03:01:35.485]  Nice to talk to you after listening to you for so many years.
[03:01:35.485 --> 03:01:36.946]  I'm not telling you anything today.
[03:01:36.946 --> 03:01:57.840]  I want to let you know that I heard something the other day through an APD police officer about the Walmart shooting of the cop, that Walmart has a policy about their employees not putting hands on any customers, and the two people who wrestled the guy to the ground are apparently being fired from Walmart.
[03:02:01.024 --> 03:02:03.425]  This is what I understand.
[03:02:03.425 --> 03:02:14.290]  I work in a convenience store, and I got this bit of conversation from the cashier talking to a police officer who came in the store.
[03:02:14.290 --> 03:02:15.731]  And he was not pleased about it.
[03:02:15.731 --> 03:02:24.075]  Apparently, Walmart has issued, I guess, the opposite of a press release to the police department, I guess a press unrelease, telling them not to talk about it.
[03:02:25.646 --> 03:02:32.668]  I figured I'd tell you because you got a crew of reporters and you might know a guy on the inside of the police department to get to the bottom of it.
[03:02:32.668 --> 03:02:35.149]  I'm blown away by it.
[03:02:35.149 --> 03:02:42.931]  I tell you what, we don't ever really use this anymore because so many thousands of people called it and a lot of it wasn't serious.
[03:02:42.931 --> 03:02:47.813]  What would happen is some crazy people would leave like 500 messages a day.
[03:02:47.813 --> 03:02:50.574]  Do we still check that comment line, guys?
[03:02:51.747 --> 03:03:08.420]  Okay, this comment line is only for police officers to call and to confirm or deny what that gentleman's saying, but it's part of the nanny state where kids can't play dodgeball, where you can't run at school, where you can't spank your kids, so the whole society degenerates.
[03:03:08.420 --> 03:03:16.466]  If it's true, because they're trying to train the public not to help each other or anybody else, that Walmart is going to fire the two employees that tackled the guy that had the gun.
[03:03:17.824 --> 03:03:19.206]  That's because they don't want any liability.
[03:03:19.206 --> 03:03:22.630]  They'd rather everybody just get killed and say, well, we have nothing to do with it.
[03:03:22.630 --> 03:03:23.231]  Just amazing.
[03:03:23.231 --> 03:03:24.673]  Because I know that is their policy.
[03:03:24.673 --> 03:03:27.577]  They say, don't defend yourself.
[03:03:27.577 --> 03:03:28.358]  It's like in school.
[03:03:28.358 --> 03:03:29.700]  They say, let a bully beat you up.
[03:03:33.982 --> 03:03:42.128]  That's another point.
[03:03:42.128 --> 03:03:54.797]  Instead of shutting the whole city down for a five-hour parade down I-35 and the rest of it, why didn't they just give the money of the tens of thousands of dollars that that cost, or a lot more, to the family?
[03:03:54.797 --> 03:03:57.559]  I mean, why make this giant spectacle?
[03:03:57.559 --> 03:03:59.341]  I mean, and they just get bigger and bigger.
[03:04:00.081 --> 03:04:02.043]  Every time stuff happens, I'll have to look into that.
[03:04:02.043 --> 03:04:05.006]  Here's the comment line.
[03:04:05.006 --> 03:04:09.090]  512-646-4444, but you're in Austin, obviously, no 512.
[03:04:09.090 --> 03:04:17.137]  646-4444, 646-4444, and I'll also bring that up Sunday because that's important.
[03:04:17.137 --> 03:04:24.745]  So he told you matter-of-factly, not that he heard it, but that it was definitely a fact that they were talking about firing those employees?
[03:04:26.900 --> 03:04:43.049]  And then, here's the kicker, she used to work at Walmart, and she said that that's their policy, that you can't... Because, you know, Walmart doesn't prosecute people for stealing less than $25 or $50 worth of merchandise, so they have this policy where you can't grab somebody, apparently.
[03:04:43.049 --> 03:04:43.309]  Anyhow...
[03:04:46.287 --> 03:04:48.830]  Uh, no, I'm just dumbfounded by what you're saying.
[03:04:48.830 --> 03:04:53.636]  And I was thinking about, but it's okay for them to own slave camps with little kids making the products.
[03:04:53.636 --> 03:04:56.238]  Well, you know, all the products now they find have blood on them.
[03:04:56.238 --> 03:04:57.280]  And the little bitty fingers.
[03:04:57.280 --> 03:04:58.621]  Bleeding.
