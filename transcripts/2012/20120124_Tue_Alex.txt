[00:00:05.677 --> 00:00:09.860]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover Ups.
[00:00:10.501 --> 00:00:11.321]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.082 --> 00:00:13.022]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.623 --> 00:00:17.266]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.826 --> 00:00:21.949]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.094 --> 00:00:34.679]  Oh, you're going to want to be tuned in to the entire transmission today.
[00:00:35.874 --> 00:00:42.298]  I was just sitting there trying to think of words to describe how hardcore and off the charts all of this news is.
[00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:48.142]  But this is going to be a massively important transmission.
[00:00:48.162 --> 00:00:50.664]  I want to thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:50.744 --> 00:00:55.327]  It is Tuesday, the 24th day of January 2012.
[00:00:56.628 --> 00:01:03.633]  Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Chris Hedges will be joining us coming up in the second hour today.
[00:01:05.031 --> 00:01:19.595]  He is suing the Obama administration, the corporate whore, nobody, teleprompter, reader, latest empty suit, because the NDAA affects journalists.
[00:01:21.075 --> 00:01:26.357]  Because it basically states in the subsections, and we'll go over these on air with him,
[00:01:27.971 --> 00:01:34.273]  That if you're aiding in any way whoever they say are terrorists, you can disappear into a black hole forever.
[00:01:34.714 --> 00:01:42.216]  And we know that under Obama, it's even worse than Bush, if that's possible, they've been persecuting whistleblowers and journalists and putting them in prison.
[00:01:44.597 --> 00:01:48.298]  Even if journalists are reporting on criminal actions of government.
[00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:52.560]  So there's a real attempt at chilling effects going on here.
[00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:54.981]  And Chris Hedges,
[00:01:56.872 --> 00:02:01.873]  Pulitzer Prize winning journalist who's suing the government over this will be joining us.
[00:02:01.934 --> 00:02:08.115]  Great job with the crew getting that guest set up today.
[00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:13.197]  Now, continuing here with the news.
[00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.452]  This is the type of stuff I have in my stack.
[00:02:17.912 --> 00:02:22.957]  You can see, if you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, let's give folks a wide shot of this if we can.
[00:02:23.438 --> 00:02:24.779]  I've got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 stacks here.
[00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:26.781]  And I don't even know where to begin.
[00:02:26.801 --> 00:02:27.962]  I'm like a dog in a butcher shop.
[00:02:35.652 --> 00:02:38.653]  A starving hyena in a butcher shop.
[00:02:38.693 --> 00:02:40.553]  No relation to canines, but whatever.
[00:02:41.213 --> 00:02:43.034]  The analogy is taken, I'm sure.
[00:02:43.854 --> 00:02:57.277]  Because you want to prove tyranny and the country is plunging into despotism and they're attacking free speech and habeas corpus and due process and private property and the family and spiking our food and water and medicine with
[00:02:58.632 --> 00:03:07.778]  Trojan horse garbage and writing white papers on how they're doing it and running giant child kidnapping rings and not getting in trouble and openly setting the precedent for it.
[00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.439]  Look at this.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.360]  L.A.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.641]  military exercise.
[00:03:12.594 --> 00:03:13.855]  KFI Newsradio.
[00:03:13.875 --> 00:03:16.597]  And it's like, oh, the military will be practicing taking over the city.
[00:03:16.637 --> 00:03:17.598]  It's for your safety.
[00:03:18.418 --> 00:03:20.200]  Just more acclamation for martial law.
[00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.123]  Here's another one out of Infowars.com with an Associated Press video.
[00:03:26.244 --> 00:03:29.026]  Red spotlights to mark pre-crime suspects.
[00:03:29.066 --> 00:03:34.490]  Folks, the AP actually calls it the new pre-crime divisions with federal grants.
[00:03:38.197 --> 00:03:42.219]  The behavioral experts or the biometrics say you're acting suspiciously.
[00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:43.819]  They say your walk is suspicious.
[00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:47.001]  And red lights from city blocks away target you.
[00:03:47.541 --> 00:03:51.102]  And then telescreens begin saying, we are watching you.
[00:03:51.202 --> 00:03:52.883]  We are your government.
[00:03:54.056 --> 00:04:00.101]  And it's got the police chief in one New Jersey city, shows all the cops, and I'm not knocking folks that are overweight, but I mean, it's like a joke.
[00:04:00.121 --> 00:04:01.502]  They're all weigh about 400 pounds.
[00:04:02.202 --> 00:04:05.185]  I mean, obviously, it just shows the decadence.
[00:04:06.206 --> 00:04:10.209]  And they're saying, you know, they got talking cameras that shout at you in England.
[00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.952]  Well, we got red spotlights on top of it.
[00:04:15.353 --> 00:04:16.313]  And the AP reporter
[00:04:17.925 --> 00:04:24.969]  If 15 years ago I was making a joke video of a police state future, I would do the voice the way the AP reporter does.
[00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:30.632]  It's like, this new pre-crime system is to keep us safe.
[00:04:31.252 --> 00:04:33.113]  Everyone loves it.
[00:04:33.513 --> 00:04:37.335]  I mean, it's like they're trying to be comically evil.
[00:04:38.516 --> 00:04:40.157]  Okay, that's two articles out of about a hundred.
[00:04:41.017 --> 00:04:41.938]  You know I'm gonna do it.
[00:04:43.075 --> 00:04:46.560]  On the other side, I'm going to attempt to read each one of these headlines and then dive into it.
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:55.732]  Rush Limbaugh has come out and actually said, and we have the article, but by the way, I forgot to tell you, there's an audio link, get that too off the article for me, at InfoWars.com.
[00:04:55.972 --> 00:04:59.737]  He's basically calling for Ron Paul and Rand Paul's arrest as terrorists.
[00:05:01.994 --> 00:05:03.496]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:03.696 --> 00:05:08.741]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:05:09.021 --> 00:05:10.382]  Saving means to make money.
[00:05:10.563 --> 00:05:19.351]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:05:20.072 --> 00:05:27.177]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:05:27.617 --> 00:05:35.222]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:05:35.602 --> 00:05:43.006]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:05:45.768 --> 00:05:48.691]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:05:48.992 --> 00:05:51.174]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:05:51.234 --> 00:05:53.497]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:06:01.917 --> 00:06:05.519]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:08.920]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.943]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:13.963 --> 00:06:20.186]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.346 --> 00:06:22.587]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:06:23.107 --> 00:06:23.407]  Tim Geithner?
[00:06:23.427 --> 00:06:23.847]  Bernanke?
[00:06:23.948 --> 00:06:24.568]  They're arsonists!
[00:06:24.608 --> 00:06:25.628]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:25.708 --> 00:06:28.150]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:42.037 --> 00:06:48.946]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:06:49.307 --> 00:06:58.439]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:07:00.598 --> 00:07:04.423]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are, a decade into the 21st century?
[00:07:04.743 --> 00:07:08.508]  Record foreclosure rates for homes, if not yours, your neighbor's.
[00:07:08.888 --> 00:07:11.391]  Thankful for the unemployment check since you were laid off.
[00:07:11.852 --> 00:07:18.360]  And placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.062]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?
[00:07:22.082 --> 00:07:27.006]  The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control.
[00:07:27.286 --> 00:07:28.567]  Your greatest dependency.
[00:07:28.827 --> 00:07:29.868]  Your food supply.
[00:07:30.248 --> 00:07:34.090]  Make 2012 the year you take control by getting prepared.
[00:07:34.431 --> 00:07:38.713]  eFoods Direct introduces the best way to build your food supply in the 21st century.
[00:07:39.654 --> 00:07:42.417]  Get a 21-day supply of food free with purchase.

[00:07:44.358 --> 00:07:45.039]  Take back control in 2012.
[00:07:45.079 --> 00:07:48.362]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:07:48.662 --> 00:07:50.083]  Remember, you can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[00:08:02.017 --> 00:08:04.239]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.259 --> 00:08:07.582]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.513 --> 00:08:29.214]  The 24th day of January 2012.
[00:08:29.774 --> 00:08:43.457]  We have Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Chris Hedges who is suing the Obama administration and the federal government over the NDAA.
[00:08:44.017 --> 00:08:54.140]  He is going to be joining us in the second hour for the first 30 minutes, 35 minutes or so of the first part of the second hour.
[00:08:56.368 --> 00:09:00.390]  So he will be joining us in the first half of the second hour today.
[00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:03.192]  Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Chris Hedges.
[00:09:05.293 --> 00:09:10.416]  SOPA and PIPA are still fully alive as I predicted they would do last week.
[00:09:11.396 --> 00:09:15.418]  I pointed out it was a victory that they had to pull the fast one and claim that they were pulling the bills.
[00:09:15.919 --> 00:09:19.401]  But I predicted that they would go ahead and turbo launch them this week.
[00:09:20.201 --> 00:09:21.622]  We have that confirmed.
[00:09:21.642 --> 00:09:23.363]  We're going to be breaking that down.
[00:09:26.981 --> 00:09:48.684]  Also, the federal government is announcing that all testing in public brainwashing centers, indoctrination, FEMA camp induction training centers, anti-family, forced inoculations, sex brainwashing, New World Order destruction camps, also known as public schools, your
[00:09:49.821 --> 00:09:55.023]  Digital DNA, digital photo, digital thumbprint will now be accessed to take test.
[00:09:55.623 --> 00:09:57.163]  It's already been like that for a long time.
[00:09:57.183 --> 00:09:58.204]  They're just now announcing it.
[00:09:59.304 --> 00:10:11.388]  All the federal computers, all the federal licensure, all the essays you write, the computer systems that quote check for plagiarism for more than a decade, that's just the cover story.
[00:10:11.928 --> 00:10:14.349]  All of your writing is held in federal databases.
[00:10:15.379 --> 00:10:19.471]  Just as all of your DNA, if born in the last 40 years.
[00:10:19.491 --> 00:10:20.314]  It's 40 years this year.
[00:10:22.113 --> 00:10:25.335]  Forty years ago, worldwide, in a global government program.
[00:10:25.675 --> 00:10:28.557]  See, we've been under global government for a long time.
[00:10:28.957 --> 00:10:41.886]  A corporate global government, where countries don't get IMF World Bank loans, countries don't get global corporations to even come and agree to build a dam, or agree to even allow them to be operating.
[00:10:41.926 --> 00:10:51.112]  I mean, if you don't want the globalists in, they finance rebels, they finance your neighbor to attack you, they inject your population with HIV, you know, half your women then get it.
[00:10:52.252 --> 00:10:53.793]  They poison your water supplies.
[00:10:53.833 --> 00:10:55.614]  I mean, this is all in State Department Morandum 200.
[00:10:55.654 --> 00:10:57.995]  They shut off your food supply.
[00:10:58.015 --> 00:11:02.517]  It's in the UN documents, UN Biological Diversity Assessments.
[00:11:03.878 --> 00:11:07.800]  So we've been under global government for a long, long time.
[00:11:09.085 --> 00:11:16.310]  Evidence of that, of course, is they celebrated 50 years of the European Union in 2007, and even people in Europe said, I thought it started in 2000.
[00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.451]  How is it a 50-year anniversary?
[00:11:19.092 --> 00:11:25.356]  Because the Treaty of Rome established the corporate governance of Europe as a receivership to N.M.
[00:11:25.436 --> 00:11:37.704]  Rothschild and Her Majesty Saxe-Coburg-Gotha of the UK and allied crime syndicate holdings of the Commonwealth, as well as the Dutch holdings
[00:11:38.891 --> 00:11:41.932]  And then allied with the United States and Rockefeller holdings.
[00:11:41.972 --> 00:11:42.933]  I mean, it's all on record.
[00:11:43.693 --> 00:11:44.674]  And they're eugenicists?
[00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:49.176]  And you got fluoride in your water to give you bone cancer and lower your IQ?
[00:11:49.316 --> 00:11:50.236]  Because they said so.
[00:11:52.097 --> 00:11:53.118]  And that's the way it is.
[00:11:54.678 --> 00:11:57.600]  And narcotics are shipped into your country because that's the way it is.
[00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:58.520]  Because they said so.
[00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:02.722]  And you're going to be in their little private prison, working for 25 cents an hour.
[00:12:03.963 --> 00:12:04.723]  Because they said so.
[00:12:06.243 --> 00:12:16.772]  You're going to displace everybody's jobs and the trader government is going to pay to have your factory shipped to China and Brazil and Eastern Europe.
[00:12:17.272 --> 00:12:21.616]  And the federal government is going to pay to have taxes raised on companies that stay in the US.
[00:12:22.236 --> 00:12:24.717]  To incentivize them leaving the United States.
[00:12:25.038 --> 00:12:30.561]  And all the billionaires on record will pay only a few percentage points in taxes.
[00:12:30.601 --> 00:12:43.588]  They will pay almost no taxes, but you, a blue-collar worker, are going to have the book thrown at you because the name of the game, the goal, is to destroy you and your family!
[00:12:46.107 --> 00:12:48.608]  And they control both political parties.
[00:12:49.048 --> 00:12:52.849]  They control the leadership of both traitorous groups.
[00:12:52.909 --> 00:12:57.651]  And it's the same thing with the parliamentary system, where you've got three or four major parties in Europe.
[00:12:57.691 --> 00:12:58.631]  This is what they're doing.
[00:13:01.012 --> 00:13:02.273]  Now, I'm going to stop right there.
[00:13:04.793 --> 00:13:09.695]  And I am going to attempt to just read you each of the headlines and then go back into it.
[00:13:09.715 --> 00:13:10.615]  You know I always fail.
[00:13:10.636 --> 00:13:14.597]  I always go two or three articles in and stop and just bore into that article.
[00:13:16.161 --> 00:13:19.143]  But things are getting wilder and crazier by the minute.
[00:13:19.223 --> 00:13:21.544]  Things are getting very, very clear.
[00:13:22.344 --> 00:13:27.867]  Things are getting to the point where the globalists don't even hide what they're doing anymore.
[00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:39.153]  Here is the article at InfoWars.com with the audio and the video.
[00:13:40.552 --> 00:13:48.096]  Limbaugh, Ron Paul sounds like an Islamic terrorist, says he would have no problem with TSA detaining U.S.
[00:13:48.116 --> 00:13:48.636]  Congressmen.
[00:13:49.356 --> 00:13:56.460]  Now you notice all the new TSA ads for a year and we told you this was coming as we got internal documents from good people inside the federal government.
[00:13:57.392 --> 00:14:04.734]  That they sold the tyranny in the name of fighting, quote, Muslim extremists, which they knew was popular in their focus group test.
[00:14:05.314 --> 00:14:08.774]  But behind the scenes, none of it was to do with Islamic terrorists.
[00:14:09.795 --> 00:14:13.275]  All of it was about gun owners, libertarians, conservatives.
[00:14:13.995 --> 00:14:16.316]  Now you see the rollout of the white Al Qaeda.
[00:14:17.576 --> 00:14:26.258]  You see the TV ads, the PSAs, the video PSAs, where everyone in these ads on TV is a white
[00:14:27.935 --> 00:14:33.981]  White collar, executive type, male, female, and everyone reporting them as a quote, minority.
[00:14:34.622 --> 00:14:41.428]  So now they're going to sell the quote, minorities, who are really the majority in most areas of the United States, that no, no, no, no, no.
[00:14:42.029 --> 00:14:44.872]  You're tired of being pointed out as the terrorist because you got brown skin?
[00:14:45.452 --> 00:14:46.914]  Now it's the white person.
[00:14:46.934 --> 00:14:47.655]  They're the terrorist.
[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:59.346]  So they're selling it in a balkanized way and rolling out and saying on the news, the militias work with Al Qaeda and are getting ready for new Oklahoma cities.
[00:14:59.406 --> 00:15:08.211]  Now does anybody believe that the militia type, I mean when 9-11 happened, most of the militias stopped being afraid of the federal government, embraced the police state.
[00:15:09.071 --> 00:15:18.715]  And basically stuck, you know, Al-Qaeda hunting licenses, you know, Al-Qaeda seasons open hunting licenses on the back of their cars.
[00:15:18.735 --> 00:15:19.936]  I mean, I'm sure you all saw those.
[00:15:20.356 --> 00:15:21.576]  American flags everywhere.
[00:15:21.656 --> 00:15:25.818]  These are good, patriotic people who bought into the propaganda.
[00:15:25.858 --> 00:15:29.900]  The idea that good old boys in Michigan or Texas
[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:44.744]  Or Indiana, or Florida, or Tennessee, or California, would get anywhere near Al Qaeda, which itself is a manufactured front group on record by the big global banks, as a way to menace us into taking away our liberties.
[00:15:46.044 --> 00:15:48.645]  Anyone who believes that is certifiably stupid.
[00:15:49.525 --> 00:15:50.485]  But the system doesn't care.
[00:15:52.326 --> 00:15:54.086]  And so now here's the rollout.
[00:15:54.166 --> 00:15:56.527]  So you've got congressmen, you've got senators,
[00:15:57.552 --> 00:16:01.953]  And Limbaugh is saying, I side with the TSA.
[00:16:02.453 --> 00:16:06.474]  Now, of course, he sided with them right at the same time the White House was siding with them.
[00:16:07.014 --> 00:16:07.934]  Here's the Hill newspaper.
[00:16:07.994 --> 00:16:13.556]  White House sides with TSA and Rand Paul standoff says they don't know anything about a police state in America.
[00:16:13.596 --> 00:16:14.136]  That's a quote.
[00:16:14.896 --> 00:16:18.637]  That's the White House spokesman, Carney, Jay Carney.
[00:16:19.157 --> 00:16:20.437]  He knows nothing about a police state.
[00:16:21.097 --> 00:16:23.958]  Just major universities list us now as number six globally.
[00:16:25.755 --> 00:16:29.217]  And goes on to say they're keeping us safe.
[00:16:30.778 --> 00:16:32.239]  And that Rand Paul is wrong.
[00:16:32.279 --> 00:16:36.221]  But Limbaugh goes even further.
[00:16:38.302 --> 00:16:47.147]  And he says to everyone involved, and we've got the clip here, we're going to play in a moment, that this is basically what they deserve.
[00:16:47.487 --> 00:16:54.691]  Not only is it good to want to grope people's genitals, not only are microwave oven scanners good,
[00:16:56.553 --> 00:16:59.916]  But he goes one further that these people are like terrorists.
[00:17:01.197 --> 00:17:02.298]  And that's how it works.
[00:17:02.338 --> 00:17:04.860]  See, you want to know if Rand Paul's for real or Ron Paul's for real?
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.700]  Look at their voting records.
[00:17:07.021 --> 00:17:13.046]  And look at how the left and the right establishment acts like they are devils.
[00:17:14.227 --> 00:17:17.550]  And they do this because the establishment is scared to death.
[00:17:18.769 --> 00:17:29.617]  Now, I have flown just five or six times on expensive private jets because over the years I've had people say, I'm sending a jet to pick you up, I want to talk to you.
[00:17:30.278 --> 00:17:34.361]  Famous Hollywood folks, people like that, they don't fly commercially.
[00:17:34.901 --> 00:17:38.763]  People that are making $20 million, $30 million, $50 million a year, they don't.
[00:17:38.943 --> 00:17:42.065]  And so it's like sending a car for you.
[00:17:42.485 --> 00:17:45.487]  You know, when I'm on national TV or something, sometimes, you know, they send a car.
[00:17:45.527 --> 00:17:47.048]  It's like a black taxi to pick me up.
[00:17:47.308 --> 00:17:49.889]  Well, for rich people, truly rich people, it's like sending a car.
[00:17:50.449 --> 00:17:59.314]  And so a Gulfstream jet, not even Gulfstream, even bigger than that, just giant wide-body jet lands and picks you up.
[00:17:59.774 --> 00:18:04.217]  And one time, I was being flown by guys that fly Rush Limbaugh.
[00:18:05.478 --> 00:18:06.879]  And they're like, oh, you're a talk show host.
[00:18:06.899 --> 00:18:08.119]  Yeah, we fly Limbaugh sometimes.
[00:18:08.159 --> 00:18:09.200]  He's got this type of jet.
[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:09.860]  It's really nice.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.401]  It's about a $40 million.
[00:18:12.441 --> 00:18:17.123]  It's about as nice as these type of jets get.
[00:18:17.183 --> 00:18:19.884]  It's the same type as this one that I was flying on.
[00:18:20.244 --> 00:18:21.625]  They were flying me out to California.
[00:18:21.645 --> 00:18:27.327]  And I'm the only guy on a jet for like 30 people can be on.
[00:18:27.948 --> 00:18:28.608]  It's ridiculous.
[00:18:29.847 --> 00:18:41.151]  And so when I got home four or five days later, I typed into the search engine about his jet, and surely enough, there were a couple jets he owns, because he makes hundreds of millions of dollars every four or five years.
[00:18:41.931 --> 00:18:45.112]  And so I understand for him, see, I'm scum.
[00:18:46.112 --> 00:18:53.095]  Obama sees us as scum, Limbaugh, all these elitists see us as scum, and they just go to a little private airport,
[00:18:53.973 --> 00:18:54.914]  Don't get checked in.
[00:18:55.214 --> 00:19:04.141]  I just walk right on the tarmac, and there's pilots and a person serving me caviar or whatever I want, and the jet takes off.
[00:19:04.181 --> 00:19:05.522]  But see, I don't live like that.
[00:19:05.602 --> 00:19:06.602]  I don't have the money for that.
[00:19:06.622 --> 00:19:08.284]  If I had the money for that, I wouldn't live like that.
[00:19:08.644 --> 00:19:12.527]  But these elitists, most of them living off bank or bailout money and stuff,
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:23.068]  They're all flying around like Bain Capital that owns, you know, what Rush Limbaugh's on that's gotten, that's been connected to Goldman Sachs and others that have gotten taxpayer money.
[00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:28.193]  They're all flying around in their big taxpayer, you know, funded jets up there in the sky.
[00:19:28.213 --> 00:19:33.137]  And then little old Alex Jones, you know, I can't fly now.
[00:19:33.237 --> 00:19:37.962]  I can't go anywhere because I won't let a pot-bellied person, you know, molest my children and my wife.
[00:19:39.847 --> 00:19:42.651]  And see, little old Rand Paul, he's flying commercial.
[00:19:42.691 --> 00:19:43.792]  He's a low-level scum.
[00:19:44.113 --> 00:19:44.594]  You know, U.S.
[00:19:44.614 --> 00:19:45.655]  Senator, according to Limbaugh.
[00:19:46.036 --> 00:19:47.217]  And so he's Al-Qaeda.
[00:19:47.658 --> 00:19:50.041]  He deserves to have himself groped.
[00:19:50.321 --> 00:19:52.745]  I'm gonna play you this clip when we get back and get into all the other news.
[00:19:53.606 --> 00:19:54.307]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:54.327 --> 00:19:54.687]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.104 --> 00:20:02.366]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:20:02.406 --> 00:20:07.753]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:20:07.994 --> 00:20:12.620]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:20:13.021 --> 00:20:18.048]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:20:18.568 --> 00:20:23.270]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[00:20:48.705 --> 00:20:50.447]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[00:22:39.349 --> 00:22:40.070]  This capitalism?
[00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:46.274]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:22:46.414 --> 00:22:47.235]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:22:47.275 --> 00:22:50.397]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[00:23:03.496 --> 00:23:08.219]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[00:23:08.659 --> 00:23:10.400]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.721]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with Fake TV.
[00:23:14.062 --> 00:23:21.245]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television, so from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[00:23:21.546 --> 00:23:25.748]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.

[00:23:56.939 --> 00:23:58.199]  The Burglar Deterrent.
[00:24:08.775 --> 00:24:12.679]  Okay, I'm gonna plunge into the off-the-charts news coming up.
[00:24:13.619 --> 00:24:18.584]  George Soros warns of violent riots in America, financial collapse, government clampdown.
[00:24:19.985 --> 00:24:20.886]  Martial law.
[00:24:22.011 --> 00:24:23.953]  That's what's going on at Davos right now.
[00:24:24.013 --> 00:24:25.114]  That's what they're discussing.
[00:24:25.714 --> 00:24:35.703]  And acting like they never saw it coming, even though they've had the military and police worldwide joint training and gearing up for it for at least two decades.
[00:24:35.743 --> 00:24:41.227]  But the minute they got rid of Glass-Steagall, where they could create a limited Ponzi fraud paper,
[00:24:42.108 --> 00:24:46.370]  In the late 90s, they began in earnest getting ready for the designed implosion.
[00:24:46.950 --> 00:25:07.080]  On the way up, the bankster, fraudster, anti-free market, trillion controller class, they're more than billionaires, they're trillionaire controllers, they control trillions, began the preparation for total implosion of the economy.
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:17.524]  Now I get so mad when I hear an audio clip like this because it just shows the tyranny manifesting that I have trouble speaking.
[00:25:18.744 --> 00:25:27.988]  I got so angry when the New York Times within 30 minutes of Rand Paul not being detained
[00:25:29.065 --> 00:25:52.123]  Coming out and saying he was never detained, Senator Rand Paul, there in Tennessee at the airport, that I called some folks I know that are high up in his office, I'll just leave it at that, and got an off-the-record that no, he's just been released, he was there about two hours, he's getting on a plane to D.C.
[00:25:52.243 --> 00:25:53.484]  I knew this before his wife did.
[00:25:54.246 --> 00:26:00.189]  Because then I called the individual back and said, yeah, I just talked to his wife, everything's, you know, and now she knows what's going on.
[00:26:00.229 --> 00:26:04.471]  The point is, is that I knew what was going on from inside while it was happening.
[00:26:07.152 --> 00:26:19.398]  And then separately, here's the New York Times, within 30 minutes of Kurt Nemo writing his article yesterday, Kurt Nemo just happened to be looking at
[00:26:20.754 --> 00:26:25.459]  emails he was getting and somebody said, hey Kurt, look at this new Twitter that was just put out by Ron Paul.
[00:26:25.499 --> 00:26:27.742]  Within minutes, Kurt was writing a blurb.
[00:26:28.423 --> 00:26:36.732]  And within 15 minutes of Kurt Nimmo writing an Infowars.com article, then it was CBS, New York Times, and all the rest of them.
[00:26:36.752 --> 00:26:37.493]  But the point is,
[00:26:41.511 --> 00:26:54.141]  New York Times, when no one knew what had happened to Rand Paul, nothing had been confirmed yet except for his phone call to his dad, Ron Paul, who then put the Twitter out that he'd been detained.
[00:26:56.784 --> 00:26:59.306]  No one else had talked to Rand Paul, not his wife, no one.
[00:26:59.686 --> 00:27:07.012]  As soon as he talked to his office, I called my source and they said, here's the deal, they're letting him get on another plane, he just got on and he's going to D.C.
[00:27:09.134 --> 00:27:10.315]  It had just come out.
[00:27:12.031 --> 00:27:15.554]  And the New York Times came out with a lie and said he was not detained.
[00:27:16.274 --> 00:27:16.975]  And others did.
[00:27:20.077 --> 00:27:30.505]  Now, it turns out for two hours they held him and would scream at him and tell him... He ended up... He'd been there about 30 minutes when he called Ron Paul.
[00:27:31.285 --> 00:27:35.889]  They came into the cubicle, and I've got his quotes here in the Daily Caller, and
[00:27:37.998 --> 00:27:40.460]  Screamed at him and said, now you're going to be held longer.
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.381]  You're not supposed to make a cell phone call.
[00:27:42.702 --> 00:27:44.043]  How do you have that cell phone?
[00:27:45.023 --> 00:27:46.505]  Or we wouldn't even have known that.
[00:27:47.085 --> 00:27:54.351]  So my point is, this is the level of deception that we deal with as a society is, oh, he wasn't detained.
[00:27:54.451 --> 00:27:55.712]  Oh, we're not groping your children.
[00:27:55.772 --> 00:27:56.913]  Oh, we're not going in their pants.
[00:27:57.213 --> 00:27:58.254]  Oh, there's no radiation.
[00:27:58.314 --> 00:27:59.755]  Oh, we're not strip searching old ladies.
[00:28:00.295 --> 00:28:02.237]  And it always comes out that they're lying.
[00:28:02.977 --> 00:28:04.939]  It's a policy of lying to us.
[00:28:06.417 --> 00:28:10.938]  And now the media is calling Rand Paul a liar, when everybody knows they detain people.
[00:28:11.318 --> 00:28:20.080]  And by the way, you're under arrest when the police car lights go on, when they tell you go over here, when they're putting their hands on you.
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:22.501]  That's a custodial arrest under common law.
[00:28:23.201 --> 00:28:26.041]  So he wasn't just detained, he was under arrest.
[00:28:26.101 --> 00:28:28.522]  It's worse than the word he even used.
[00:28:29.733 --> 00:28:36.660]  And in America, Ron Paul has been on this show and talks about him groping his genitals and going in people's pants.
[00:28:41.225 --> 00:28:42.606]  And what did the media at that time do?
[00:28:42.646 --> 00:28:44.648]  They came out and said, Ron Paul's lying.
[00:28:44.668 --> 00:28:48.032]  They don't go in the pants until all these videos came out showing it happening.
[00:28:48.252 --> 00:28:52.917]  And they said, well, we don't call that going in the pants, even though we do go in your pants.
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:59.362]  Remember a few months ago they said these old ladies, 90 years old, 85 in one case, they're lying.
[00:28:59.382 --> 00:29:01.263]  We don't take them in the back room and strip search them.
[00:29:01.643 --> 00:29:04.744]  And then it came out that indeed they were and they apologized last week.
[00:29:05.824 --> 00:29:06.805]  But they're still doing it.
[00:29:07.065 --> 00:29:09.026]  They always say we're going to stop and they don't stop.
[00:29:09.786 --> 00:29:12.407]  It's just a psychological warfare program.
[00:29:12.427 --> 00:29:17.849]  And we're going to go to break and come back with a Limbaugh clip, but imagine.
[00:29:18.869 --> 00:29:19.670]  I want to fly.
[00:29:20.928 --> 00:29:26.572]  I want to go places, but I cannot have hot-bellied pedophiles stick their hands down my daughter's pants.
[00:29:27.232 --> 00:29:28.874]  I mean, they take baby's diapers off.
[00:29:29.954 --> 00:29:30.955]  They beat people up.
[00:29:30.995 --> 00:29:32.396]  People have died in their custody.
[00:29:32.736 --> 00:29:33.737]  I can't be part of it.
[00:29:34.638 --> 00:29:37.359]  And then Limbaugh just says, you know what, we're all Al-Qaeda.
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:43.824]  He comes out and says, we're going to play the clip here, that he's an Islamist terrorist.
[00:29:44.985 --> 00:29:46.546]  Folks, it's not a joke.
[00:29:47.981 --> 00:29:49.845]  They're gonna start arresting people like us.
[00:29:50.146 --> 00:29:51.048]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.549 --> 00:29:53.152]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.094 --> 00:29:56.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.462]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:03.662 --> 00:30:08.708]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:30:08.968 --> 00:30:10.350]  Saving means to make money.
[00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:19.300]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:30:20.021 --> 00:30:27.123]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:30:27.563 --> 00:30:35.165]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:30:35.565 --> 00:30:40.487]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:30:40.787 --> 00:30:42.947]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:30:45.728 --> 00:30:48.650]  Or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.

[00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:01.801]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:01.861 --> 00:31:07.203]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:31:07.443 --> 00:31:12.065]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:31:12.465 --> 00:31:12.845]  It's true.
[00:31:12.925 --> 00:31:17.487]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:31:18.027 --> 00:31:22.730]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:31:23.251 --> 00:31:25.172]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:31:25.572 --> 00:31:30.175]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:31:30.375 --> 00:31:31.276]  And here's the best part.
[00:31:31.496 --> 00:31:34.258]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:31:34.558 --> 00:31:37.860]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:31:38.181 --> 00:31:41.022]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:31:41.363 --> 00:31:43.264]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:31:43.584 --> 00:31:44.505]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:31:48.147 --> 00:31:50.288]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:31:51.108 --> 00:31:56.890]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:31:57.210 --> 00:31:59.671]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:32:01.152 --> 00:32:15.597]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:32:16.624 --> 00:32:20.325]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:21.306 --> 00:32:33.311]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:32:34.071 --> 00:32:41.334]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:32:42.034 --> 00:32:51.644]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:32:52.405 --> 00:32:55.689]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:32:56.329 --> 00:32:59.453]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[00:33:04.127 --> 00:33:06.488]  No, I won't back down in the face of tyranny.
[00:33:07.128 --> 00:33:10.829]  I'll stand my ground.
[00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:15.031]  You can't back down.
[00:33:15.651 --> 00:33:27.035]  I mean, if you back down to a tiger in the Indian jungle or a lion on an African savannah, it's gonna think you're a prey and it's gonna definitely eat you.
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:31.661]  And so I've got to stand my ground.
[00:33:32.101 --> 00:33:34.263]  It's not courage, but just getting back to this.
[00:33:35.864 --> 00:33:37.565]  I went and looked up the planes because I was forgetting them.
[00:33:37.865 --> 00:33:56.238]  I've flown on G4s, G5s, wide-body aircraft that people in Hollywood, and again, I've never really sought out Hollywood, but over the years, famous folks have invited me out there, flown me out there, come and pick me up before, and I've seen how these people live.
[00:33:57.538 --> 00:34:06.025]  And, you know, somebody comes and picks you up in a $20 million, $30 million, $40 million aircraft, G4s, G5s, wide body.
[00:34:06.045 --> 00:34:08.408]  I mean, you could put 40 passengers on them.
[00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:13.272]  And it's all, you know, the finest of everything.
[00:34:15.574 --> 00:34:19.177]  And that's how Rush Limbaugh lives.
[00:34:21.886 --> 00:34:25.991]  I flew with some guys, like, oh yeah, you're a talk show host, and one of the pilots had heard the show a few times.
[00:34:26.011 --> 00:34:26.992]  Yeah, I've seen you on YouTube.
[00:34:27.352 --> 00:34:30.055]  Yeah, yeah, a few years ago, you know, we've flown Limbaugh before.
[00:34:30.095 --> 00:34:31.657]  He's a nice guy, blah, blah, blah.
[00:34:32.237 --> 00:34:34.240]  Yeah, we fly him down to the Caribbean, blah, blah.
[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:36.882]  Oh yeah, Limbaugh's famous for his trips to the Caribbean by himself.
[00:34:37.925 --> 00:34:39.866]  And, but they didn't get into any of that.
[00:34:40.647 --> 00:34:42.208]  And it just made me think about it later.
[00:34:42.928 --> 00:34:46.070]  So I went and searched it and found out about the aircraft he owned.
[00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:48.992]  $20 million, $40 million aircraft.
[00:34:49.793 --> 00:34:52.575]  And just keeping pilots on standby to fly the aircraft.
[00:34:52.975 --> 00:34:57.238]  So I understand why Limbaugh thinks it's all funny, just like Obama does.
[00:34:57.878 --> 00:34:59.379]  And just like Nancy Pelosi does.
[00:34:59.419 --> 00:35:02.741]  And just like the former head of Bain Capital.
[00:35:04.142 --> 00:35:05.183]  Limbaugh's former boss.
[00:35:07.099 --> 00:35:14.401]  An owner, Mitt Romney, Mr. Abortion, Mr. Open Borders, Mr. Obamacare, that we're told is so great to vote for.
[00:35:17.401 --> 00:35:19.902]  I understand, because they're all flying around above us.
[00:35:20.602 --> 00:35:21.382]  You know how you fly?
[00:35:21.402 --> 00:35:30.524]  You go over here to Austin-Berkshire Airport, where I live, you pull up, you walk in, there's no security, somebody walks over and asks if you want a drink or coffee.
[00:35:32.759 --> 00:35:36.541]  And when you get on board, you sign your name with the pilots on a register.
[00:35:36.901 --> 00:35:38.182]  Sometimes I haven't even done that.
[00:35:38.722 --> 00:35:41.464]  And then you just take off into the wild blue yonder.
[00:35:42.444 --> 00:35:48.207]  And by the way, when you pull up at these private aviation facilities, there's people in them all over the place.
[00:35:50.709 --> 00:35:54.771]  I've been in some of these places before where there's 20 or 30 people in there getting ready to get on aircraft.
[00:35:55.351 --> 00:35:56.872]  And that's how they all fly.
[00:35:58.291 --> 00:36:02.855]  The people that run America, the people that have made the decision, you wonder why Congress does this?
[00:36:03.135 --> 00:36:05.557]  Most of these Congress people have stolen so much money.
[00:36:05.917 --> 00:36:11.802]  You'll see the statistics where they go to Congress worth a million dollars, and six years later are worth 400, 500 million.
[00:36:11.822 --> 00:36:20.009]  You know, why would you spend millions and millions to get elected to a position where you get paid a couple hundred thousand a year?
[00:36:20.329 --> 00:36:27.155]  Because they're in there insider trading, they're in there buying and selling this country, getting payoffs, you name it.
[00:36:29.073 --> 00:36:31.876]  And then if you criticize that, they're like, oh, you're anti-free market.
[00:36:31.956 --> 00:36:47.611]  No, it's not free market to have trillions of dollars, 27 trillion last time we counted, 16 trillion that was secret to the Federal Reserve, and counting, given to mega banks, given to MSNBC, given to media divisions,
[00:36:48.917 --> 00:36:57.184]  And given to subdivisions of Goldman Sachs and others that are connected to him, like Bain Capital and others, that then goes to talk show host.
[00:36:57.385 --> 00:37:01.969]  People have always wondered, how can Rush Limbaugh get paid more money a year than his show makes?
[00:37:04.391 --> 00:37:12.778]  Because it's the weapons division of the New World Order to keep conservatives in line while he's hanging out partying, you know, with
[00:37:14.221 --> 00:37:17.444]  Elton John, which I'm not there judging Elton John.
[00:37:17.684 --> 00:37:19.345]  But people are like, well, he's a conservative leader.
[00:37:19.545 --> 00:37:22.688]  What's he doing spending millions of dollars on a party and hanging out?
[00:37:22.728 --> 00:37:24.449]  Well, that's what Rush Limbaugh does.
[00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:25.130]  He's not.
[00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:26.671]  That's he's that's who he is.
[00:37:27.812 --> 00:37:31.935]  These are a bunch of grandiose people who were empty.
[00:37:31.955 --> 00:37:35.879]  I mean, if I was worth hundreds of millions of dollars, I'll assure you.
[00:37:36.693 --> 00:37:38.634]  I wouldn't be spending two million dollars on a party.
[00:37:39.295 --> 00:37:43.377]  You better believe it'd be going to charities for children in the third world.
[00:37:43.417 --> 00:37:44.918]  By the way, that's where some of my money does go.
[00:37:46.119 --> 00:37:47.280]  But I'm not judging them.
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:49.161]  They can do what they want with their money.
[00:37:49.841 --> 00:38:01.189]  But don't sit there and create a two-class system where I get my genitals grabbed, and I get body scanned, and my wife gets her breasts grabbed, and then they literally grab them, and my children get trained
[00:38:02.383 --> 00:38:18.471]  for sexual assault by a bunch of out-of-control goons that violates my Fourth Amendment, my Bill of Rights, my Constitution, my Republic, and you sit around laughing about us, how we're unwashed masses and how funny it is that the TSA is doing this.
[00:38:20.526 --> 00:38:23.909]  By the way, Senators can get a card and go around TSA.
[00:38:24.289 --> 00:38:26.871]  Of course, Rand Paul doesn't even know that.
[00:38:27.532 --> 00:38:29.133]  Because he's not into elitist perks.
[00:38:29.153 --> 00:38:29.914]  He's a regular guy.
[00:38:30.454 --> 00:38:34.998]  Ron Paul can go around the screening since other Congress people complained.
[00:38:35.038 --> 00:38:35.779]  He doesn't do it.
[00:38:36.019 --> 00:38:36.779]  He goes through it.
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:40.743]  The media then lied and said he uses taxpayer money to fly first class.
[00:38:40.763 --> 00:38:43.265]  Turned out MSNBC and AP had to retract.
[00:38:43.645 --> 00:38:44.826]  That wasn't even true.
[00:38:45.306 --> 00:38:47.868]  He flies so frequently, sometimes he gets upgraded.
[00:38:48.509 --> 00:38:49.170]  They upgraded him.
[00:38:50.017 --> 00:38:51.998]  That's the crimes of Ron Paul.
[00:38:52.218 --> 00:38:57.561]  When he's flying to and from the district, it's paid for by taxpayers, and they spend it and say he has first class.
[00:38:57.901 --> 00:39:02.743]  Meanwhile, Ron Paul's being harassed and groped and grabbed on, as he said here on this show.
[00:39:03.524 --> 00:39:07.225]  And Limbaugh talks about the Paul family and says they're basically Islamic terrorists.
[00:39:07.566 --> 00:39:08.166]  They deserve it.
[00:39:10.027 --> 00:39:11.828]  And my daughters are terrorists?
[00:39:12.819 --> 00:39:29.923]  Or old ladies that are made to walk when they can't and they make passengers help them get up out of their chair and like rip colostomy bags off of them and take them behind closed doors and scream at them and make the old women strip down, 90-year-old women going home to die of cancer in one of the cases?
[00:39:30.563 --> 00:39:32.244]  Oh yeah, one of them I saw last year is dead now.
[00:39:32.904 --> 00:39:43.187]  She was going home to Michigan to die, 91 years old, stage 4 cancer, going home to see the family, going home to die!
[00:39:44.568 --> 00:39:46.709]  And they screamed at her, she couldn't get out of the wheelchair.
[00:39:47.469 --> 00:39:53.591]  She had one family member with her, a woman couldn't get her out of the chair, they screamed and made passengers come over and help.
[00:39:54.795 --> 00:39:55.776]  That's America!
[00:39:55.996 --> 00:40:05.321]  And then you get this pill-popping, synthetic heroin head who takes synthetic heroin, takes so much of it, he's got to be put in a coma to go off of it!
[00:40:07.682 --> 00:40:17.967]  Being caught flying in from third world sex tourism destinations with bottles of Viagra he doesn't have prescriptions for.
[00:40:17.987 --> 00:40:22.690]  I guess that's why a few times he didn't fly on his private jet for whatever reason.
[00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:28.892]  They're sitting there lecturing us, and look, I don't get nasty about these other talk show hosts.
[00:40:28.932 --> 00:40:29.352]  You know that.
[00:40:29.392 --> 00:40:32.913]  I don't spend my time attacking other talk show hosts, even though they attack me sometimes.
[00:40:33.233 --> 00:40:34.593]  But I'm sick of it, man!
[00:40:35.334 --> 00:40:36.794]  I'm tired of this fascism!
[00:40:37.314 --> 00:40:42.936]  They're now setting up highway checkpoints where they're going to try to grope my family, and enough's enough!
[00:40:44.853 --> 00:40:49.916]  I would love nothing more than to be able to get up here and commend Rush Limbaugh, and commend Glenn Beck.
[00:40:50.156 --> 00:40:52.358]  You notice I haven't been attacking Glenn Beck as much lately?
[00:40:52.878 --> 00:41:05.386]  Because he's now endorsing Ron Paul, he's now, uh, when I do spot check him, admitting the stuff's going on, and I guess that's why he got thrown out of Fox, because he was getting too hardcore, and he's going in the right direction, so you don't hear me talking about Glenn Beck.
[00:41:06.746 --> 00:41:08.067]  Even though they imitate everything we do.
[00:41:08.207 --> 00:41:08.728]  I'm glad!
[00:41:08.808 --> 00:41:09.228]  Imitate it!
[00:41:09.408 --> 00:41:10.108]  Just don't twist it!
[00:41:10.469 --> 00:41:10.709]  Good!
[00:41:12.256 --> 00:41:17.861]  And Limbaugh, I grew up in high school listening to him, and he was a different person, and he helped wake me up.
[00:41:18.201 --> 00:41:19.522]  I don't hate Rush Limbaugh.
[00:41:19.562 --> 00:41:21.083]  He's a sad person.
[00:41:21.624 --> 00:41:27.589]  And Rush, it's time for you to turn back, man, and not be such a disgusting New World Order servant.
[00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:32.213]  I mean, you don't have to enthusiastically bash Rand Paul.
[00:41:33.214 --> 00:41:40.437]  I understand you're a sellout, you gotta have your hundreds of millions and your trophy wives, and you're in a prison, and when I look at you on TV, you look like you're in hell.
[00:41:41.758 --> 00:41:44.279]  I mean, we all punish ourselves for what we are.
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:49.962]  But you'd be a lot happier if you, and I'm sure you're blackmailed, I mean, who knows?
[00:41:50.802 --> 00:41:59.627]  The point is, is that it is time for you guys to stop being so happy about stabbing America in the back.
[00:42:00.047 --> 00:42:02.428]  I mean, I know you're mercenaries, I got all that.
[00:42:03.427 --> 00:42:09.371]  But, I mean, just don't have so much fun slitting America's throat while you dance around posing as conservatives.
[00:42:11.012 --> 00:42:14.074]  By the way, we are number one in Orlando and other cities against Limbaugh.
[00:42:15.155 --> 00:42:18.897]  Anywhere they put me on, even a moderate station, I will destroy all these people.
[00:42:19.058 --> 00:42:23.721]  You talk about free market, you have to have a monopoly cartel to be number one in this country.
[00:42:24.437 --> 00:42:33.066]  I'm down here with a plastic baseball bat knocking home runs when you've got a big Louisville Slugger.
[00:42:33.346 --> 00:42:34.408]  I've got a baseball bat.
[00:42:34.428 --> 00:42:36.229]  You shouldn't be able to hit a ball five feet.
[00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:38.972]  And I'm knocking it out of the park, pal, and you know it.
[00:42:39.133 --> 00:42:42.196]  So don't give me all this free market stuff and survival of the fittest.
[00:42:42.636 --> 00:42:45.940]  Everybody knows this show's a trillion times more hardcore.
[00:42:47.654 --> 00:42:56.239]  I don't even want to dominate all these people, but it's pathetic to see these propped up facades by the New World Order there to co-opt conservatives.
[00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:01.282]  There's articles out today about Mitt Romney has to have paid crowds of people with signs.
[00:43:01.322 --> 00:43:02.103]  Of course he does.
[00:43:03.383 --> 00:43:07.186]  Newt Gingrich can't even get a crowd, it's being reported, because it's all fake.
[00:43:07.526 --> 00:43:10.207]  You really think he won by those percentage points in South Carolina?
[00:43:10.608 --> 00:43:12.749]  We told you that's where you'd see the fraud a month ago.
[00:43:13.749 --> 00:43:15.091]  Confirmed fraud in Iowa!
[00:43:15.671 --> 00:43:17.413]  Florida's gonna be confirmed fraud!
[00:43:20.777 --> 00:43:23.840]  And again, I've spent 43 minutes ranting about just this issue.
[00:43:24.121 --> 00:43:27.224]  Because here's Rush Limbaugh agreeing with the White House.
[00:43:27.545 --> 00:43:29.186]  White House says Rand Paul's bad.
[00:43:29.206 --> 00:43:32.831]  The media runs a hoax saying he wasn't detained.
[00:43:34.741 --> 00:43:35.922]  He was arrested, folks.
[00:43:35.962 --> 00:43:36.663]  That's what it is.
[00:43:36.943 --> 00:43:40.526]  It's arrest when you're told you can't leave this area.
[00:43:41.107 --> 00:43:42.548]  That's a custodial arrest.
[00:43:43.108 --> 00:43:43.869]  That's the law.
[00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:48.153]  And when they start groping your children, it's sexual assault.
[00:43:49.154 --> 00:43:50.995]  And here's Rand Paul.
[00:43:54.558 --> 00:43:59.603]  It's against federal law to detain him except for murder or treason.
[00:44:00.646 --> 00:44:03.468]  Read Article 1, Section 6 of the law!
[00:44:03.728 --> 00:44:04.508]  The big law!
[00:44:05.029 --> 00:44:06.590]  He's there two hours!
[00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:08.551]  Misses votes in the Senate!
[00:44:09.372 --> 00:44:10.352]  It's on record!
[00:44:10.452 --> 00:44:11.853]  And what does the New York Times do?
[00:44:12.093 --> 00:44:14.655]  They take the word of confirmed liars.
[00:44:15.736 --> 00:44:22.020]  The TSA, while he hasn't even gotten on his airplane yet, after two hours of being held up, and say it isn't true.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.462]  From a group that lies about everything under the sun.
[00:44:29.181 --> 00:44:30.202]  And what does Limbaugh do?
[00:44:31.082 --> 00:44:32.543]  Article at Infowars.com.
[00:44:32.604 --> 00:44:38.488]  Limbaugh, Ron Paul sounds like an Islamic terrorist, says he would have no problem with TSA detaining US Congressmen.
[00:44:39.929 --> 00:44:41.010]  And this is from a guy...
[00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:56.077]  Who's got 20 and 40 million dollar aircraft and flies around eating caviar above all of us, financed by Mitt Romney's company, who the other head of it just went to work to replace Mobster Daily in the Obama administration.
[00:44:56.517 --> 00:44:59.879]  One big, nasty, disgusting family.
[00:45:03.781 --> 00:45:06.563]  Fat on our banker bailout money on your taxes.
[00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:17.166]  And all the incentives to de-industrialize this country lecturing us about free market all day and now implying that Rand Paul is a terrorist.
[00:45:17.186 --> 00:45:18.227]  Let's go ahead and play the clip.
[00:45:18.247 --> 00:45:18.728]  Here it is.
[00:45:20.989 --> 00:45:22.150]  The video clip and audio clip.
[00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:23.010]  Here it is, folks.
[00:45:25.072 --> 00:45:28.874]  Kentucky Senator Rand Paul has been detained by the TSA.
[00:45:31.269 --> 00:45:37.512]  At the Nashville Airport, he set off the alarms and refused a pat-down, so they detained him.
[00:45:38.372 --> 00:45:41.934]  He said his dad had known about it, and it's become a big story out there.
[00:45:42.594 --> 00:45:48.817]  Now, if this had been Ron Paul, you couldn't really blame the TSA.
[00:45:48.917 --> 00:45:53.559]  You have to admit, Ron Paul almost sounds like an Islamic terrorist sometimes, but this wasn't.
[00:45:57.513 --> 00:45:58.674]  This was Rand Paul.
[00:45:58.794 --> 00:46:02.959]  Anyway, folks, the Republican establishment is in a full-blown panic.
[00:46:02.979 --> 00:46:03.981]  All right, that's enough.
[00:46:06.183 --> 00:46:09.167]  And again, I don't even like attacking Limbaugh.
[00:46:09.267 --> 00:46:10.989]  It's just so pathetic.
[00:46:11.772 --> 00:46:15.014]  Yeah, to be clear from the clip, he's saying Ron Paul's the terrorist.
[00:46:15.054 --> 00:46:22.419]  The point is, they're implying that people are terrorists, let's have the NDAA, let's secret arrest people, let's do all of this.
[00:46:22.779 --> 00:46:31.004]  And then, if you go to the urban warfare drills, or you get press passes, like I did last year, sent Rob Due to Illinois, it was U.S.
[00:46:31.064 --> 00:46:34.567]  troops training to put American dissenters in camps.
[00:46:35.007 --> 00:46:35.507]  On video!
[00:46:36.768 --> 00:46:38.469]  And I've been to so many of these myself.
[00:46:39.010 --> 00:46:40.891]  Here it is out of KFI Radio.
[00:46:42.418 --> 00:46:43.639]  A.M.
[00:46:43.659 --> 00:46:43.639]  640.
[00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:48.641]  And it says L.A.
[00:46:48.681 --> 00:46:50.021]  military exercises.
[00:46:50.502 --> 00:46:51.902]  And it says the L.A.P.D.
[00:46:52.062 --> 00:46:58.925]  with the military will be running drills in different parts of the cities that will involve helicopters.
[00:47:00.946 --> 00:47:01.927]  And it goes on from there.
[00:47:03.907 --> 00:47:07.109]  And it's all to condition the military and the public for domestic operations.
[00:47:07.509 --> 00:47:09.210]  I told you this 14, 15 years ago.
[00:47:10.070 --> 00:47:11.671]  Now they admit that's what it's for.
[00:47:15.643 --> 00:47:17.324]  That's the type of news reports I have.
[00:47:17.404 --> 00:47:21.187]  All over the country they're putting in cameras that yell orders at you now.
[00:47:23.849 --> 00:47:31.915]  And that spotlight you from hundreds of yards away with powerful spotlights and begin barking orders at you with bullhorns.
[00:47:33.637 --> 00:47:41.843]  I've got that coming up after a Pulitzer Prize-winning author that's suing the federal government over the NDAA joins us.
[00:47:44.245 --> 00:47:45.286]  But there's Limbaugh
[00:47:47.817 --> 00:47:49.417]  And you read Rand Paul's statement.
[00:47:52.458 --> 00:47:55.178]  He was held for two hours and told he couldn't leave.
[00:47:57.039 --> 00:48:03.560]  And just like when there's thousands of videos of him groping women, children, hands down pants, what does TSA always do when they're confronted on TV?
[00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:04.620]  They go, we don't do that.
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:05.880]  They put out statements, we don't do that.
[00:48:07.021 --> 00:48:10.201]  And they say, oh, well, in the pants, we don't call that in the pants.
[00:48:10.621 --> 00:48:11.322]  Oh, a strip search?
[00:48:11.342 --> 00:48:13.122]  We take your clothes off, but that's not a strip search.
[00:48:14.192 --> 00:48:16.574]  Well, there's radiation, but we say it's not bad for you.
[00:48:17.195 --> 00:48:19.578]  Just a pure culture of lying.
[00:48:20.879 --> 00:48:21.439]  But so what?
[00:48:21.459 --> 00:48:22.781]  It's us, the unwashed masses.
[00:48:25.123 --> 00:48:28.447]  What did one of the Rockefellers tell Aaron Russo in that interview I did with him?
[00:48:30.709 --> 00:48:34.112]  Aaron knew he was pretty much a dead man gonna die, so he kind of gave that deathbed.
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:35.901]  He died a few months later.
[00:48:35.981 --> 00:48:36.661]  Talk with us.
[00:48:37.222 --> 00:48:41.566]  He couldn't even really walk when I went and met with him in Houston outside the cancer research facility.
[00:48:42.086 --> 00:48:43.968]  He was ready to tell the story of Nick Rockefeller.
[00:48:44.388 --> 00:48:52.335]  Nick Rockefeller said, yeah, we're all going to have chips in us and our chip is going to tell the police we've got diplomatic immunity and we can do whatever we want.
[00:48:53.736 --> 00:48:55.037]  We're going to walk through the airports.
[00:48:55.117 --> 00:48:56.719]  We're not going to be able to stop us.
[00:48:57.199 --> 00:48:58.741]  And I already see that in the news.
[00:49:00.239 --> 00:49:05.343]  Or in California and other areas, the license plates of government employees can't even be read.
[00:49:05.883 --> 00:49:07.124]  And where they live is secret.
[00:49:08.885 --> 00:49:11.627]  And now the military gets to go through their own line.
[00:49:12.168 --> 00:49:15.530]  Oh, the military can be trusted, but citizens can't, because they're the enemy.
[00:49:16.331 --> 00:49:24.717]  Not only is the military going to operate domestically, something you never do in a free society, because the military fights an enemy, and because every third world despotic country has the military domestically,
[00:49:26.223 --> 00:49:31.907]  But now they're even separating them more, where the bureaucrats, the pilots said we're not going to be part of this, so they're left alone.
[00:49:32.188 --> 00:49:34.910]  The military goes to their own line and doesn't get searched.
[00:49:38.052 --> 00:49:44.837]  They're now putting that in place, but we, the little citizen scumbags, we have absolutely no rights.
[00:49:46.719 --> 00:49:47.900]  And that's the elite plan.
[00:49:51.571 --> 00:49:56.660]  And Nick Rockefeller was telling him that it was going to be, and he gave me photos of him with Nick Rockefeller.
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:57.181]  We looked it up.
[00:49:57.221 --> 00:49:58.464]  Sure enough, it's Nick Rockefeller.
[00:49:59.025 --> 00:50:00.026]  Part of the Rockefeller family.
[00:50:01.309 --> 00:50:04.194]  Lives in China most of the time, running big operations for him over there.
[00:50:07.318 --> 00:50:10.040]  But now they're just saying they're going to skip the chip, it's going to be a face scan.
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:12.522]  But then you'll have a special RFID on your card.
[00:50:12.582 --> 00:50:15.103]  And the cops are not allowed to stop you.
[00:50:15.183 --> 00:50:16.544]  And you're like, well how do they do that?
[00:50:16.584 --> 00:50:19.486]  It's already in common law for Senators and House members.
[00:50:20.287 --> 00:50:21.808]  And it's for the UN, has it?
[00:50:22.108 --> 00:50:25.110]  The globalists are going to have global get-out-of-jail-free cards.
[00:50:26.972 --> 00:50:30.474]  While the rest of us can just be secretly arrested and disappeared for no reason.
[00:50:31.034 --> 00:50:34.577]  They are scientifically codifying total evil.
[00:50:35.635 --> 00:50:36.075]  And why?
[00:50:36.095 --> 00:50:39.376]  A lot of people send me emails and go, well, I'm going along with the system, I have nothing to worry about.
[00:50:39.756 --> 00:50:44.938]  The system is going to shut off all the resources on purpose to consolidate control.
[00:50:45.278 --> 00:50:49.099]  They want you so poor, you can't even think about resisting.
[00:50:50.219 --> 00:50:52.960]  The UN says that's why they want people to be poor worldwide.
[00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:57.141]  All right, I'm going to get into the even bigger news with George Soros when we come back.
[00:50:57.161 --> 00:50:58.602]  Then we've got the Pulitzer Prize winner joining us.
[00:51:01.055 --> 00:51:02.236]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:51:02.496 --> 00:51:12.941]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[00:51:13.141 --> 00:51:17.243]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[00:51:17.603 --> 00:51:20.026]  But we can't do that without your help.
[00:51:20.346 --> 00:51:31.199]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[00:51:31.639 --> 00:51:34.783]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[00:51:35.103 --> 00:51:40.745]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[00:51:41.245 --> 00:51:50.728]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[00:51:51.148 --> 00:51:52.308]  The war is here.
[00:51:52.628 --> 00:51:54.069]  It's an info war.
[00:51:54.529 --> 00:51:56.470]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[00:52:03.502 --> 00:52:07.544]  Folks, have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[00:52:07.964 --> 00:52:10.945]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[00:52:11.305 --> 00:52:15.386]  Because there's never been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead.
[00:52:15.707 --> 00:52:16.307]  Here's why.
[00:52:16.707 --> 00:52:22.509]  Solar power generators are now available from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[00:52:22.829 --> 00:52:27.311]  Their emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:52:27.691 --> 00:52:33.775]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[00:52:34.075 --> 00:52:37.678]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:52:37.918 --> 00:52:43.482]  Whether it's ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:52:43.862 --> 00:52:49.225]  When the power goes out this winter, you'll be ready with a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.
[00:52:49.486 --> 00:52:52.308]  Go to MySolarBackup.com for more information.
[00:52:52.488 --> 00:52:54.769]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:52:57.551 --> 00:52:57.639]  Yeah.

[00:55:20.296 --> 00:55:27.972]  Okay, continuing here, and I'm going to cover this more after our next guest leaves us at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:55:30.385 --> 00:55:35.669]  If you go to Infowars.com, you can read the article, but it came out of the Daily Beast, a division of Newsweek.
[00:55:36.069 --> 00:55:43.234]  Soros from Davos, it's going on right now, warns of violent riots in America, financial collapse, government clampdown.
[00:55:43.795 --> 00:55:46.136]  He says survival is the most important thing.
[00:55:46.156 --> 00:55:52.701]  He was in a sit-down interview with the Daily Beast, and he said he's never seen something this bad.
[00:55:54.997 --> 00:56:05.043]  He says, from surviving the Nazi occupation of Hungary during World War II to single-handedly crushing the currencies of entire nations, the experience he brings to the table should not be ignored.
[00:56:05.443 --> 00:56:08.485]  This is a Mark Slavo article at Infowars.com.
[00:56:09.605 --> 00:56:11.126]  You know, I was trying to look for it during the break.
[00:56:11.166 --> 00:56:11.907]  I've seen it many times.
[00:56:11.927 --> 00:56:12.647]  I may have pulled it.
[00:56:13.047 --> 00:56:18.791]  But he was on 60 Minutes a decade ago and admitted to being a Nazi sympathizer who helped round up fellow Jews.
[00:56:19.551 --> 00:56:23.454]  In Hungary, and he said, well, if I didn't do it, somebody else would have, so he doesn't feel bad for it.
[00:56:23.914 --> 00:56:28.538]  Now, I wanted to play that on the nightly news tonight, but Dews and they're looking for it for like 30 minutes and can't find it.
[00:56:28.898 --> 00:56:29.999]  He even remembered the quotes.
[00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:35.843]  Can somebody find that video and email it to showtipsatinfowars.com?
[00:56:37.945 --> 00:56:41.668]  I mean, I'm sure we're going to find it, but I think he needs to be all over YouTube.
[00:56:41.688 --> 00:56:46.792]  He must be jerking it down, because I want to get the truth about Soros out.
[00:56:46.852 --> 00:56:48.093]  But the point here
[00:56:49.500 --> 00:57:08.486]  By the way, speaking of Glenn Beck, when Glenn Beck actually had the courage to play clips of this and talk about it, Soros threatened to come after him and then said the media implied it was anti-Semitic to talk about how Soros helped track down and find Jews' property and help take it.
[00:57:10.103 --> 00:57:13.946]  And so now, if you're not for hunting down Jews and taking their property, you're anti-Semitic.
[00:57:14.267 --> 00:57:20.111]  I mean, this is the upside-down world, and the ADL said they were concerned, and, you know, you don't talk about Soros like that.
[00:57:20.232 --> 00:57:21.292]  It's just so sick!
[00:57:21.953 --> 00:57:22.954]  It's so sick!
[00:57:23.374 --> 00:57:24.055]  It's sick!
[00:57:24.575 --> 00:57:25.276]  It's sick!
[00:57:26.077 --> 00:57:26.657]  It's sick!
[00:57:27.658 --> 00:57:28.398]  It's sickening!
[00:57:28.418 --> 00:57:33.022]  Yeah, people making jokes about Ron Paul getting groped and ran Paul.
[00:57:34.163 --> 00:57:37.106]  And people getting detained and saying, oh, they're like Muslim terrorists.
[00:57:39.011 --> 00:57:39.631]  It's sick!
[00:57:40.211 --> 00:57:45.852]  It's sick to have all these TV shows glorifying torture, including of people's children, to get answers.
[00:57:46.112 --> 00:57:48.553]  And then in the real world, the military is torturing children.
[00:57:49.433 --> 00:57:50.513]  In the Army's own report.
[00:57:52.074 --> 00:57:52.654]  That's sick.
[00:57:52.714 --> 00:57:53.594]  That's dangerous.
[00:57:53.854 --> 00:57:55.314]  And it will be used on us.
[00:57:55.955 --> 00:58:01.836]  Like Ron Paul has said about the NDAA and some of these debates, he said, hey, it could be you next, media.
[00:58:02.316 --> 00:58:02.876]  Why are you going?
[00:58:02.896 --> 00:58:03.516]  Don't you get it?
[00:58:03.536 --> 00:58:04.576]  It is going to be for us.
[00:58:05.236 --> 00:58:07.697]  The New World Order hates Americans a lot more than they hate
[00:58:09.133 --> 00:58:09.593]  Muslims?
[00:58:10.013 --> 00:58:10.673]  Or foreigners?
[00:58:11.333 --> 00:58:12.174]  They've always hated us.
[00:58:12.214 --> 00:58:16.655]  Why do they have incentives to ship our jobs overseas?
[00:58:16.735 --> 00:58:27.437]  So Soros, who said he was having a great crisis a few years ago, who says he's pulling all his money out of the markets for total collapse, he's now acting like he's upset when he's one of the main authors of it.
[00:58:28.177 --> 00:58:34.138]  And at Davos, they're saying they're going to help us get rid of capitalism and bring in a new socialism to make it all fair.
[00:58:34.338 --> 00:58:35.638]  That means give all the money to themselves.
[00:58:35.979 --> 00:58:38.119]  And they're debating how to be moral right now.
[00:58:43.702 --> 00:58:47.463]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.905 --> 00:58:54.726]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are, a decade into the 21st century?
[00:58:55.046 --> 00:58:58.807]  Record foreclosure rates for homes, if not yours, your neighbor's.
[00:58:59.188 --> 00:59:08.651]  Thankful for the unemployment checks since you were laid off, and placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[00:59:09.131 --> 00:59:12.352]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?
[00:59:12.372 --> 00:59:17.294]  The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control.
[00:59:17.594 --> 00:59:18.854]  Your greatest dependency.
[00:59:19.114 --> 00:59:20.175]  Your food supply.
[00:59:20.535 --> 00:59:24.396]  Make 2012 the year you take control by getting prepared.
[00:59:24.736 --> 00:59:29.018]  eFoods Direct introduces the best way to build your food supply in the 21st century.

[00:59:47.063 --> 00:59:49.883]  Remember, you can bet your life on efoodsdirect.
[00:59:53.664 --> 00:59:55.605]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.065 --> 00:59:58.786]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.492 --> 01:00:09.675]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.316 --> 01:00:11.136]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.917 --> 01:00:12.818]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.458 --> 01:00:17.061]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.642 --> 01:00:21.725]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.402 --> 01:00:29.205]  Alright, we are now into the second hour.
[01:00:29.285 --> 01:00:35.789]  We're scheduled during the next segment to have Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Chris Hedges on.
[01:00:37.833 --> 01:00:42.916]  He's suing the Obama administration over the NDAA that could be used against himself and others that they've been targeting.
[01:00:44.116 --> 01:00:49.539]  Not just whistleblowers, but journalists that talk to whistleblowers about corruption, from torture to you name it.
[01:00:50.399 --> 01:00:55.242]  In the new system, somebody like Cy Hirsch would end up being thrown in prison.
[01:00:55.282 --> 01:01:01.445]  So he's doing something that's absolutely needed, so we're going to be talking to him about that coming up.
[01:01:02.478 --> 01:01:05.641]  Ron Paul has been ignored in the GOP debate once again.
[01:01:06.321 --> 01:01:12.126]  Congressman was afforded less time than any other speaker, and his only big question was asked, when are you going to drop out?
[01:01:12.546 --> 01:01:16.409]  To imply like he's not a real candidate in number two position in most states.
[01:01:17.650 --> 01:01:24.815]  With this rent-a-candidate Mitt Romney, this corporate plastic Republican version of Obama.
[01:01:26.076 --> 01:01:29.039]  Because they're both slick, they're both handsome men.
[01:01:30.489 --> 01:01:35.512]  They both can lie well, and they pretty much stand with the very same policies.
[01:01:36.553 --> 01:01:41.976]  I mean, this should... Conservatives always talk about not liking rhinos and not liking fake conservatives.
[01:01:43.057 --> 01:01:44.298]  I mean, it's getting worse.
[01:01:44.378 --> 01:01:45.259]  It's not getting better.
[01:01:46.505 --> 01:01:52.652]  I don't want to hear any criticism of liberals that supported Obama, thinking they'd get all these free goodies and the whole world would be great.
[01:01:53.152 --> 01:01:55.095]  He's owned by the very same megabanks.
[01:01:55.595 --> 01:02:03.164]  He just hired the former head of Bain Capital, one of the colleagues of Mitt Romney to head up the financial stuff, and it replaced Daley.
[01:02:04.403 --> 01:02:08.228]  I mean, it's just absolutely the same pedigree, the same crew politically.
[01:02:08.488 --> 01:02:10.211]  It's the same political pedigree.
[01:02:10.631 --> 01:02:12.113]  The same political funders.
[01:02:12.534 --> 01:02:13.955]  The same political system.
[01:02:13.976 --> 01:02:20.864]  These ruthless megacorporations that are not free market, that are turning our world into a fascist structure.
[01:02:20.885 --> 01:02:22.366]  I don't just use the word fascist.
[01:02:23.131 --> 01:02:26.013]  Because it's, you know, a fun word like, you know, Hitler this, Hitler that.
[01:02:26.734 --> 01:02:28.155]  Fascism is what this is.
[01:02:28.915 --> 01:02:36.781]  When government is there to give contracts and to have a controlled economy for a select group of free market systems.
[01:02:38.582 --> 01:02:43.766]  And the black uniforms of the secret police and the war-like expansionist tendencies.
[01:02:45.747 --> 01:02:46.488]  The cameras.
[01:02:46.508 --> 01:02:50.491]  I mean, it's got all the tell-tale... It's a perfect fascism.
[01:02:52.179 --> 01:02:52.800]  And it's here.
[01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:55.301]  And it's growing like a cancer.
[01:02:56.502 --> 01:03:01.565]  And Rush Limbaugh makes jokes and says, so what if Rand Paul is detained for two hours?
[01:03:01.645 --> 01:03:05.268]  Ron Paul deserves to be because he's like a domestic terrorist.
[01:03:05.808 --> 01:03:07.229]  Sounds like an Islamic terrorist.
[01:03:09.030 --> 01:03:10.972]  For just saying, let's not launch new wars.
[01:03:11.052 --> 01:03:12.653]  We're going bankrupt.
[01:03:13.133 --> 01:03:19.537]  See, the big mega corporations that are getting the no-bid contracts, the oil, and dominating the globe, they don't care if America goes bankrupt.
[01:03:19.557 --> 01:03:21.719]  In fact, they want it to because then we're in debt to them.
[01:03:22.878 --> 01:03:26.061]  Because they're controlled by the big mega banks that issue the currency and credit.
[01:03:27.002 --> 01:03:30.385]  They want to get us into debt, because they're getting us into made-up debt.
[01:03:30.585 --> 01:03:35.229]  They get the world for nothing out of a giant militarized Ponzi scheme.
[01:03:35.249 --> 01:03:42.795]  See, a smart Ponzi scheme doesn't implode like Ponzi or Madoff, who are just low-level people, like Ken Lay.
[01:03:43.636 --> 01:03:46.799]  People think of them as high-level, but that's about as high-level as the system burns.
[01:03:47.199 --> 01:03:47.800]  They're mid-level.
[01:03:49.051 --> 01:03:52.213]  Overall the scheme low-level if you compare it to the real owners of the system.
[01:03:52.693 --> 01:03:59.238]  But a smart Ponzi scheme has a propaganda system and is backed up by military force and threatens the entire system.
[01:03:59.298 --> 01:04:04.581]  It's so big that they say if you cut out the cancer the system bleeds to death.
[01:04:05.121 --> 01:04:09.884]  So the answer is the cancer just grows and grows and grows and holds everyone hostage.
[01:04:10.485 --> 01:04:12.266]  And things get worse by increment.
[01:04:14.318 --> 01:04:18.241]  And then now, oh, they are doing military drills for the American people.
[01:04:18.341 --> 01:04:19.822]  Oh, those weren't drills for overseas.
[01:04:20.742 --> 01:04:26.747]  Oh, they are asking your kids in the public schools and private schools, you know, what do mommy and daddy do politically?
[01:04:27.916 --> 01:04:29.958]  Oh, they are setting up domestic spy groups.
[01:04:30.138 --> 01:04:34.361]  They are hiring the preachers under clergy response teams to spy on their flocks.
[01:04:34.461 --> 01:04:42.887]  I mean, every creepy, scary thing we've seen from authoritarian societies, like they've got a list and they're just going down it.
[01:04:42.907 --> 01:04:45.610]  And this police state is so absurdist.
[01:04:46.510 --> 01:04:47.891]  It's like a cartoon version.
[01:04:48.652 --> 01:04:49.853]  It's so over the top.
[01:04:51.374 --> 01:04:52.875]  We'll be right back with our special gift.
[01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:57.178]  And then coming up, I'll get into all the financial news and more in your phone calls today.
[01:04:57.478 --> 01:04:57.939]  Stay with us.
[01:05:01.301 --> 01:05:06.725]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:05:07.946 --> 01:05:12.729]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:05:13.089 --> 01:05:19.814]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:05:21.803 --> 01:05:28.135]  They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[01:05:30.302 --> 01:05:34.143]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:05:34.883 --> 01:05:37.984]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[01:05:38.725 --> 01:05:39.545]  Others don't.
[01:05:39.945 --> 01:05:41.826]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:05:42.106 --> 01:05:43.606]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[01:05:43.886 --> 01:05:46.447]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:05:46.767 --> 01:05:53.029]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:05:53.389 --> 01:05:55.610]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:05:56.090 --> 01:05:58.130]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[01:05:58.471 --> 01:05:58.951]  Others don't.
[01:06:00.896 --> 01:06:01.681]  Maybe you're right.
[01:06:04.694 --> 01:06:05.634]  Tyranny is here.
[01:06:05.954 --> 01:06:09.435]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:06:09.815 --> 01:06:12.076]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:06:12.096 --> 01:06:17.557]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:06:17.977 --> 01:06:24.238]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:06:24.638 --> 01:06:30.199]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:06:30.619 --> 01:06:34.300]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:38.763]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:06:39.084 --> 01:06:44.588]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:06:45.028 --> 01:06:48.010]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:06:48.591 --> 01:06:49.992]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:06:50.552 --> 01:06:51.073]  It's here.

[01:07:01.414 --> 01:07:02.916]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:07:03.116 --> 01:07:08.162]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:07:08.422 --> 01:07:09.784]  Saving means to make money.
[01:07:09.964 --> 01:07:18.754]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:07:19.475 --> 01:07:26.599]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:07:27.019 --> 01:07:34.623]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:07:35.023 --> 01:07:39.945]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[01:08:12.156 --> 01:08:13.137]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.698 --> 01:08:17.321]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.881 --> 01:08:22.045]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:23.266 --> 01:08:28.870]  Okay, Chris Hedges, Pulitzer Prize winning author, got in a little bit late, he needs a few minutes, we're gonna be calling him back.
[01:08:30.168 --> 01:08:33.151]  He and others are suing Obama over indefinite detention law.
[01:08:33.171 --> 01:08:36.253]  We're going to be talking to him here in just a few minutes.
[01:08:36.834 --> 01:08:44.380]  But just illustrating how crazy the police state has gotten, we don't have time to play the whole video here.
[01:08:45.261 --> 01:08:52.066]  But if you go to Infowars.com, you can pull up the entire article.
[01:08:53.294 --> 01:08:54.857]  And watch the whole thing.
[01:08:55.578 --> 01:08:58.984]  Red spotlights to mark pre-crime suspects.
[01:08:59.845 --> 01:09:03.692]  And the whole piece is done like a cartoon.
[01:09:03.952 --> 01:09:04.573]  We do have him now.
[01:09:06.497 --> 01:09:07.178]  Okay, the video's ready.
[01:09:09.887 --> 01:09:16.328]  It is like a cartoon in that it is so incredibly ridiculous.
[01:09:16.729 --> 01:09:34.673]  It's like if I was making a video about a joke police state with a simpering voice, creamily talking about the security and how much the citizens love the cameras and the license plate readers in the town and the red spotlight that spotlights them from hundreds of yards away and the police getting off on it.
[01:09:35.013 --> 01:09:35.893]  But it's not a joke.
[01:09:36.753 --> 01:09:38.394]  It's not a 1984 remake.
[01:09:39.055 --> 01:09:39.915]  It's New Jersey.
[01:09:40.336 --> 01:09:41.756]  Let's go ahead and go to part of that clip.
[01:09:43.538 --> 01:09:47.700]  It almost looks like a scene from the science fiction movie Minority Report.
[01:09:48.121 --> 01:09:54.105]  A New Jersey city is going to start marking people with a red light before they might commit a crime.
[01:09:54.785 --> 01:10:02.350]  The police chief in East Orange, William Robinson, is embracing it as the latest pre-crime law enforcement technique.
[01:10:02.751 --> 01:10:04.532]  Whereas London have talking cameras,
[01:10:05.899 --> 01:10:08.294]  We're about to deploy light projecting cameras.
[01:10:09.241 --> 01:10:12.243]  Better known as light-based intervention systems.
[01:10:12.943 --> 01:10:20.647]  The directed red lights will be attached to existing surveillance cameras and can shoot a light beam a full city block away.
[01:10:21.207 --> 01:10:33.613]  If a police officer monitoring one of the city's many high-def cameras sees a crime about to occur, like someone about to get mugged, they will remotely bathe the would-be perpetrator in red light.
[01:10:34.033 --> 01:10:37.695]  The message to the criminals is the police are observing you,
[01:10:39.056 --> 01:10:42.820]  Police are recording you, and the police are responding.
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:51.128]  A few years ago, East Orange had one of the worst crime rates in the state, as rival Crips and Bloods gangs battled and sold drugs.
[01:10:51.488 --> 01:10:59.617]  The city used federal grant money to invest in lots of new technology, which the chief says has brought crime down to the lowest level since the 1960s.
[01:11:01.298 --> 01:11:03.780]  Daily policing here is all high-tech.
[01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:09.605]  Sensors attached to the top of patrol cars instantly read the license plates of all vehicles.
[01:11:09.865 --> 01:11:10.826]  The car passes.
[01:11:11.226 --> 01:11:13.528]  A monitor shows a picture of the car owner.
[01:11:13.988 --> 01:11:16.810]  Okay, so there is the Associated Press.
[01:11:17.791 --> 01:11:38.101]  And the whole thing is like something out of Stephen King's The Running Man, or a remake of 1984, where how wonderful it is, and there's telescreens telling you to watch out for terrorists, and they're going in Walmart, and the citizens are spying on each other, and it's to stop the drugs, which we all know are grown in Afghanistan under the military's watchful gaze.
[01:11:39.082 --> 01:11:43.644]  It is off the charts how the system isn't trying to hide the authoritarian system now,
[01:11:44.684 --> 01:11:51.128]  It's coming out with it in the most absurdist, ridiculous, over-the-top way, hiding it in plain view.
[01:11:51.928 --> 01:11:55.790]  Now, we have a very eloquent gentleman joining us.
[01:11:55.810 --> 01:11:59.332]  I always enjoy reading his articles and also watching speeches he gives.
[01:11:59.652 --> 01:12:11.278]  Chris Hedges is a Pulitzer Prize-winning American journalist, author, and war correspondent specializing in American politics and Middle Eastern politics and societies, currently a senior fellow at the Nation Institute in New York City.
[01:12:11.818 --> 01:12:15.003]  He was a foreign correspondent for the New York Times for 15 years.
[01:12:15.484 --> 01:12:18.268]  He has reported for more than 50 countries.
[01:12:19.130 --> 01:12:22.675]  And he's got a bunch of best-selling books, latest in the world as we know it.
[01:12:23.357 --> 01:12:25.139]  And he is, as you know, suing...
[01:12:25.967 --> 01:12:29.148]  We appreciate him coming on in such a busy schedule right now.
[01:12:30.029 --> 01:12:38.352]  He started a class action suit over the indefinite detention law because we've seen whistleblowers and journalists that talk to him now being persecuted.
[01:12:38.712 --> 01:12:40.592]  And the way this is written, it affects journalists.
[01:12:40.933 --> 01:12:43.674]  So he joins us to talk about this and the state of the world.
[01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:45.974]  Chris, great to have you on with us.
[01:12:46.355 --> 01:12:46.715]  Thank you.
[01:12:47.275 --> 01:12:49.876]  Do you ever pinch yourself and think that you might be asleep?
[01:12:54.755 --> 01:12:55.916]  Well, that's certainly true.
[01:12:57.076 --> 01:13:02.498]  Give us your take on the NDAA and why you've decided to carry out this class action suit.
[01:13:02.778 --> 01:13:05.960]  Well, the lawyers actually approached me because they needed a credible plaintiff.
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:17.024]  And since I had been the Middle East Bureau Chief for the New York Times and had been in the region for seven years, I'd had frequent contact with both individuals and groups that are defined by the U.S.
[01:13:17.044 --> 01:13:19.025]  State Department as either terrorists
[01:13:19.645 --> 01:13:21.586]  Terrorists or terrorist organizations.
[01:13:21.626 --> 01:13:35.653]  That would include Hamas, Islamic Jihad in Gaza, the old PLO is to go to Tunis and see Arafat and Abu Jihad when they were both branded as international terrorists, the Kurdistan Workers Party or the PKK.
[01:13:35.733 --> 01:13:40.476]  So the language of the bill offers no exemptions for journalists.
[01:13:41.756 --> 01:13:50.140]  It is amorphous and frightening, you know, nebulous terms like substantially supported, associated forces.
[01:13:50.580 --> 01:14:06.907]  And in the reading of these lawyers, and I think frankly a lot of lawyers, it leaves a lot of room for the state to use the military, overturning over 200 years of domestic law, as a policing agent to snatch American citizens
[01:14:07.247 --> 01:14:07.767]  We're good to go.
[01:14:30.379 --> 01:14:40.262]  Court of New York and if we can move quickly Hopefully we can get an injunction because this legislation is supposed to go into effect in March
[01:14:40.638 --> 01:14:44.301]  Okay, so to correct that, the media when I was reading from got that wrong.
[01:14:44.321 --> 01:14:49.924]  I guess they may have said class action because other reporters can join if they have standing or is that not the case?
[01:14:49.944 --> 01:14:59.691]  They haven't gone out and I mean I think that mine is such a peculiar history that they feel they don't really need.
[01:14:59.871 --> 01:15:00.171]  Got it.
[01:15:00.772 --> 01:15:02.453]  They don't need, I mean there aren't many
[01:15:03.706 --> 01:15:04.588]  I don't think so.
[01:15:13.533 --> 01:15:20.397]  So basically you have the perfect standing as the former New York Times Bureau Chief over there and you know as your job meeting with all these groups.
[01:15:21.538 --> 01:15:33.725]  I mean I would be genuinely concerned because they all claimed at the time, the establishment did, the authoritarian supporters that the Patriot Act wouldn't be used in non-terror related cases or on citizens.
[01:15:34.145 --> 01:15:38.548]  Now they admit it's used thousands of times a year per state, even at the state level.
[01:15:38.848 --> 01:15:40.169]  I mean they're using all of this.
[01:15:41.992 --> 01:15:52.618]  You know, when they passed the 2001 legislation, what we got was this sort of radical interpretation of it by Bush's legal advisor, John Yoo, and others.
[01:15:53.019 --> 01:16:03.225]  And that's Jose Padilla, who is an American citizen, allegedly was one of the hijackers who didn't make it on a plane, held for three and a half years by the military.
[01:16:04.365 --> 01:16:04.645]  I think?
[01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:35.782]  And the executive branch, again, using that 2001 legislation, serves as judge, jury, and executioner, although he is a U.S.
[01:16:35.842 --> 01:16:37.522]  citizen and orders his assassination.
[01:16:39.322 --> 01:16:48.464]  So, yeah, I mean, this essentially codifies into place, legalizes this kind of activity.
[01:16:50.904 --> 01:16:54.625]  And, I think importantly, it frees the state up from going after groups
[01:16:55.786 --> 01:17:04.593]  That under the old legislation, you couldn't do this unless people were directly tied to Al-Qaeda or had some kind of tangential involvement in 9-11.
[01:17:04.673 --> 01:17:10.197]  Now, you can go after groups that didn't even exist in 2001.
[01:17:11.499 --> 01:17:17.524]  These so-called associated forces, I mean, a lot of these groups in Yemen and Somalia weren't even around in 9-11.
[01:17:17.624 --> 01:17:20.246]  So, yeah, it's pretty serious.
[01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:22.711]  Well, it certainly is.
[01:17:23.732 --> 01:17:25.333]  Look, there was a Liberty Dollar case.
[01:17:25.373 --> 01:17:30.597]  You probably didn't see it, but the Associated Press and other publications wrote about it.
[01:17:32.018 --> 01:17:39.905]  And Bernard von Nothaus had the Royal Hawaiian Mint and all these other groups putting out commemorative coins.
[01:17:40.285 --> 01:17:46.830]  Well, he put out a Liberty Dollar, and in the after-conviction ruling for counterfeiting,
[01:17:47.751 --> 01:17:49.312]  The FBI and the U.S.
[01:17:49.372 --> 01:17:51.934]  Attorney said this guy's a domestic terrorist.
[01:17:52.354 --> 01:17:54.316]  He's a unique form of terrorism.
[01:17:54.696 --> 01:17:58.179]  And so we want the full 22 years that he can get for this.
[01:17:58.219 --> 01:18:02.702]  So I more and more in cases also hear them use that terrorism term.
[01:18:03.062 --> 01:18:05.444]  And we see the military industrial complex building up.
[01:18:05.484 --> 01:18:10.708]  We have no fly lists that you can't find out how you get on the list or how you get off.
[01:18:10.768 --> 01:18:14.090]  All these, you know, domestic spying agencies.
[01:18:15.872 --> 01:18:23.997]  We've gotten the MIAC and Homeland Security reports that list gun owners, libertarians, anti-war activists as affiliated with terrorism.
[01:18:25.038 --> 01:18:27.920]  So, I mean, I see this being used across the board.
[01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:34.184]  I mean, even the Senators involved that supported it said, you better affect citizens when there was a debate about that, the NDAA.
[01:18:34.204 --> 01:18:37.967]  You know, we kill the Lockheed, we'll kill citizens if we want.
[01:18:38.568 --> 01:18:41.269]  And then Lieberman said, we want to scare people.
[01:18:41.289 --> 01:18:44.592]  I'm sure you've probably seen those creepy quotes.
[01:18:47.072 --> 01:19:00.383]  Well, there's no question if you read the legislation that this includes American citizens, and there's also no question that it's a direct and egregious violation of our constitutional rights.
[01:19:00.463 --> 01:19:13.355]  Now, the lawyers feel that because of that it has a pretty good chance of getting to the Supreme Court, but the Court's so stacked with corporate stooges that we're not at all sure that it's going to
[01:19:14.322 --> 01:19:16.144]  Uh, it's going to get through the Supreme Court.
[01:19:16.164 --> 01:19:21.069]  The Supreme Court will either hear it or, you know, rule.
[01:19:23.266 --> 01:19:23.906]  In our favor.
[01:19:24.026 --> 01:19:27.887]  So, I mean, I think it's still worth doing, and it's important.
[01:19:27.967 --> 01:19:28.408]  And you're right.
[01:19:28.448 --> 01:19:30.388]  I mean, look at what happened in the drug wars.
[01:19:30.468 --> 01:19:38.091]  I mean, first they institute testing for prisoners, then they institute testings for people looking for jobs and people applying for welfare.
[01:19:38.131 --> 01:19:41.872]  I mean, it always creeps out where you don't want to hand the state these kinds of powers.
[01:19:42.352 --> 01:19:52.195]  And if there is any kind of serious unrest, if the power elite feels threatened from whatever, from popular movements, this essentially allows them to call in the army.
[01:19:52.675 --> 01:19:55.197]  And I don't know what the motives to the bill is.
[01:19:55.217 --> 01:20:05.703]  I mean, I do find it interesting that all of the intelligence agencies, the FBI, the CIA, the National Intelligence Agency, even the Attorney General's Office were against this piece of legislation.
[01:20:05.743 --> 01:20:06.904]  The Pentagon was against it.
[01:20:07.304 --> 01:20:08.865]  So you have to ask, why does it pass?
[01:20:08.985 --> 01:20:10.186]  Why is it being pushed through?
[01:20:11.447 --> 01:20:26.977]  Robert Mueller, the head of the FBI, actually went up to Congress and testified that passing this legislation would make the work of the FBI more difficult because it would be harder to get people to cooperate if you extend these kinds of powers to the military and yet it passes anyway.
[01:20:27.837 --> 01:20:29.999]  And I think the way the legislation is written
[01:20:30.999 --> 01:20:37.203]  It gives a kind of iron bar to those who want to crush internal dissent.
[01:20:38.164 --> 01:20:40.885]  You know, maybe they don't trust the police finally to protect them.
[01:20:41.606 --> 01:20:43.667]  And this allows them to call in the U.S.
[01:20:43.687 --> 01:20:44.127]  military.
[01:20:45.048 --> 01:20:47.870]  Yeah, for those that haven't read the bill, it gets rid of posse comitatus.
[01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:59.697]  It also declares that they can basically kill anybody globally whenever they want, which I really see as a transference of war powers completely out of Congress into the office of the presidency.
[01:21:00.444 --> 01:21:04.974]  And that was the battle between Carl Levin's office and the White House.
[01:21:04.994 --> 01:21:07.179]  It was never over the denial of due process.
[01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:11.107]  It was over the fact that Obama wanted these powers in his hands.
[01:21:12.153 --> 01:21:17.595]  Uh, and, uh, he wanted the ability to either target, i.e.
[01:21:17.675 --> 01:21:21.036]  select, those who would be targeted or offer them exemptions.
[01:21:21.616 --> 01:21:22.216]  Uh, and he got it.
[01:21:22.276 --> 01:21:22.896]  That's what he got.
[01:21:23.016 --> 01:21:24.857]  But it was, there was never an argument at all.
[01:21:24.937 --> 01:21:33.839]  Dianne Feinstein actually proposed language that would have exempted American citizens, and both the Obama White House and the Democratic leadership turned it down.
[01:21:34.315 --> 01:21:44.278]  So we're talking about divine right of king type stuff, but generally even kings in ancient Europe and feudal times, as you know, had to trump up something.
[01:21:44.638 --> 01:21:53.840]  This is just, we'll do whatever we want, but don't worry, Obama and Mitt Romney have both said, you can trust us, we won't abuse this.
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:55.541]  Well, you know, he did.
[01:21:55.701 --> 01:22:00.022]  Obama issued a signing statement that said that it would not be used on American citizens.
[01:22:00.717 --> 01:22:03.822]  Well, that begs the question, then why didn't you put that in the legislation?
[01:22:04.683 --> 01:22:11.574]  The legislation does permit these kinds of draconian forms of control, stripping of legal rights, to be carried out against U.S.
[01:22:11.654 --> 01:22:12.014]  citizens.
[01:22:12.054 --> 01:22:15.179]  So, if it's not your intent to use it on American citizens, then you should
[01:22:16.324 --> 01:22:17.745]  Well, Chris, that's what's even scarier.
[01:22:17.765 --> 01:22:18.885]  I want to get your view on this.
[01:22:18.945 --> 01:22:23.766]  Again, Pulitzer Prize winner, best-selling author, researcher, journalist Chris Hedges is our guest.
[01:22:24.627 --> 01:22:27.027]  Why also the exercise of deception?
[01:22:27.327 --> 01:22:36.490]  I mean, early on, two months ago, it doesn't affect citizens, and it has that deceptive language where it says you're exempt, except this section says you're not.
[01:22:37.070 --> 01:22:39.231]  And then they deny it affects citizens for a while.
[01:22:39.671 --> 01:22:41.312]  Then the White House says they're against it.
[01:22:41.552 --> 01:22:42.872]  Then they blame Carl Levin.
[01:22:43.112 --> 01:22:44.813]  He says, hey, you told us to do this.
[01:22:45.573 --> 01:22:54.858]  And then, after it passes, we see this victory lap by Graham and others of the Senators saying, you better defect, citizens.
[01:22:54.918 --> 01:23:00.962]  Almost like a weird celebration with hopping up and down by some of the Senators.
[01:23:01.002 --> 01:23:06.745]  I mean, this is like a science fiction movie with caricatures of bad guys.
[01:23:07.025 --> 01:23:08.806]  Well, because it's like Obamacare.
[01:23:08.846 --> 01:23:10.067]  They figure no one's going to read it.
[01:23:11.550 --> 01:23:12.811]  Actually, this is quite readable.
[01:23:12.991 --> 01:23:14.031]  You can pull it up on the web.
[01:23:14.071 --> 01:23:14.691]  It's not that long.
[01:23:14.751 --> 01:23:18.373]  Obamacare is 2,000 pages of corporate malfeasance.
[01:23:19.633 --> 01:23:24.615]  So, they're just assuming that people won't read the legislation, and they spin it.
[01:23:24.875 --> 01:23:28.037]  You know, it's completely disingenuous.
[01:23:28.297 --> 01:23:33.879]  That's a very kind word to use about the Obama White House and their characterization of what this bill does.
[01:23:33.979 --> 01:23:35.299]  I mean, it's pretty clear.
[01:23:35.319 --> 01:23:39.541]  You don't have to go to Harvard Law School to figure out what they're saying.
[01:23:39.844 --> 01:23:47.307]  I want to talk more about your case and so many other issues in the limited time we have with you, but separately, you probably haven't heard it because it just happened yesterday.
[01:23:47.667 --> 01:23:49.128]  We played the clip in the last hour.
[01:23:49.708 --> 01:23:58.052]  Rush Limbaugh has come out and said basically that Ron Paul and Rand Paul have both complained about being detained and harassed by TSA and groped.
[01:23:58.892 --> 01:24:06.819]  That they sound like Islamic terrorists and deserve, and I'm reading quotes here, that the TSA needed to do this.
[01:24:07.359 --> 01:24:11.403]  And so now we're even starting to hear, well, Ron Paul doesn't want a war with Iran.
[01:24:11.703 --> 01:24:12.824]  He's with the terrorists.
[01:24:12.844 --> 01:24:18.208]  It doesn't matter if, as you mentioned, most of the experts in the CIA and the government say don't have a war.
[01:24:18.909 --> 01:24:19.650]  It doesn't matter if
[01:24:22.572 --> 01:24:25.734]  The whole TSA thing is blatantly unconstitutional.
[01:24:26.514 --> 01:24:34.199]  We're now even hearing kind of the neocon mouthpieces more and more talk about public figures as being terrorists.
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:35.880]  Well, I hadn't heard that.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:39.783]  I mean, there's a reason corporate sponsors pay him for... what is it?
[01:24:39.803 --> 01:24:41.083]  Earn $4 million a year?
[01:24:42.324 --> 01:24:44.005]  I think it's more like $15 million a year.
[01:24:44.045 --> 01:24:44.505]  Is it really?
[01:24:44.766 --> 01:24:46.687]  Yeah, he's got a $100 million contract.
[01:24:46.947 --> 01:24:47.467]  Is he really?
[01:24:47.747 --> 01:24:47.947]  Yeah.
[01:24:48.328 --> 01:24:49.929]  Well, I mean, you know, let's...
[01:24:50.754 --> 01:24:51.254]  Follow the money.
[01:24:51.635 --> 01:24:52.536]  I mean, who does he work for?
[01:24:52.576 --> 01:24:53.096]  Who pays him?
[01:24:53.156 --> 01:24:53.897]  And why does he say it?
[01:24:54.217 --> 01:24:57.259]  And why is he getting that much money?
[01:24:59.557 --> 01:25:04.799]  What is your view of Ron Paul overall on the whole war issue?
[01:25:04.839 --> 01:25:10.540]  Because the corporate media tries to act like he's crazy, but I mean, the former head of the Mossad agrees with him.
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:13.821]  The last two chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff agree with him on Iran.
[01:25:13.841 --> 01:25:20.803]  I mean, most of the experts agree with him, but then there's this hoax that people that don't want a bunch of new wars are the bad guys.
[01:25:21.863 --> 01:25:27.425]  No, on the issue of the wars, I'm totally in agreement with Ron Paul, and I speak as somebody who has spent a lot of time in Iran.
[01:25:28.311 --> 01:25:31.514]  And, of course, a lot of time in the region.
[01:25:32.776 --> 01:25:34.958]  An assault on Iran would just be catastrophic.
[01:25:34.978 --> 01:25:45.088]  It would trigger a regional war, not to mention thousands and thousands of dead, because most of these facilities are built in highly densely populated areas.
[01:25:45.148 --> 01:25:47.771]  So, it would trigger a kind of war of Shi'ism.
[01:25:47.791 --> 01:25:49.813]  Remember, Iraq is 60% Shi'a.
[01:25:51.471 --> 01:26:02.779]  Uh, no, it's just, uh, yeah, so on the issues of the war, I think, uh, and not only the war, but the issue of internal, uh, activity by the security and surveillance state.
[01:26:02.819 --> 01:26:08.863]  I think Ron Paul's one of the few voices, I don't know if he's in the mainstream, but, you know, at least he can get up on the debates.
[01:26:08.883 --> 01:26:12.206]  He's one of the very few voices that, uh, that is speaking out.
[01:26:14.225 --> 01:26:19.328]  Getting back specifically to your lawsuit, what's the timetable on this?
[01:26:19.388 --> 01:26:20.209]  When will we know?
[01:26:20.689 --> 01:26:23.671]  And what is your lawsuit basically declaring?
[01:26:24.372 --> 01:26:30.615]  It's asking that the law be annulled because it's unconstitutional.
[01:26:30.936 --> 01:26:32.337]  That we're not asking for anything else.
[01:26:35.243 --> 01:26:36.584]  Uh, they've assigned a judge.
[01:26:36.604 --> 01:26:37.764]  We're trying to find out who it is.
[01:26:37.784 --> 01:26:45.166]  Uh, if, you know, we know the records of the judges, which are actually not bad on civil liberties in the Southern District Court.
[01:26:45.186 --> 01:26:50.428]  Uh, and if they feel that the judge is open to hearing this case.
[01:26:50.928 --> 01:26:59.012]  Chris, going back to why the system is doing this, I've got another angle I want you to comment on and get your take on.
[01:27:17.134 --> 01:27:25.517]  I have seen this NDAA and the SOPA bill and all of this wake people up who were asleep like nothing I've ever seen before.
[01:27:25.978 --> 01:27:29.459]  I mean, I'd say the response is 10, 15 times what the Patriot Act was.
[01:27:30.099 --> 01:27:31.740]  A, are you seeing it wake people up?
[01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:35.001]  And B, why do you think it's starting to wake people up?
[01:27:35.502 --> 01:27:43.785]  Well, I think, you know, there's all sorts of intrusions into our life that are no longer theoretical.
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:55.086]  The passage of the Pfizer reform bill, in essence, makes legal what under our Constitution has traditionally been illegal, and does so retroactively.
[01:27:55.566 --> 01:28:00.089]  The warrantless wiretapping, monitoring, and eavesdropping of tens of millions of Americans.
[01:28:00.609 --> 01:28:03.571]  The SOPA bill, as you pointed out, I mean, I think it's just too hard to ignore.
[01:28:04.932 --> 01:28:11.235]  My understanding is that the poll, the polling on the NDAA, is that only between 2 and 9% of the American public supports it.
[01:28:11.275 --> 01:28:12.536]  This has no public support.
[01:28:12.936 --> 01:28:15.238]  The Pfizer Reform Act didn't have any public support either.
[01:28:15.698 --> 01:28:23.663]  There are powerful corporate forces that want to ram it through because it protects them and this narrow oligarchic elite.
[01:28:24.684 --> 01:28:30.648]  But it's left a really bad taste in the mouths of the vast majority of the American public.
[01:28:30.668 --> 01:28:32.249]  And this is not a left-right issue.
[01:28:33.696 --> 01:28:37.019]  You know, you have even figures like Rick Santorum denouncing it.
[01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:42.444]  It has to do with the basic issue of civil liberties, which cuts across the political spectrum.
[01:28:42.824 --> 01:28:47.669]  So, at least on the ground, I think, you know, the vast majority of Americans seem to be behind us.
[01:28:48.109 --> 01:28:55.076]  Whether the courts, you know, will rule on behalf of the citizens or rule finally on behalf of the corporations, we'll have to find out.
[01:28:55.964 --> 01:28:58.244]  Well, I was about to raise the left-right issue.
[01:28:58.424 --> 01:29:02.925]  Issues like the TSA, warrantless wiretaps, secret arrest, torture.
[01:29:03.285 --> 01:29:20.909]  This is something unifying America, and it's really becoming clear that it's a tag team with the Republicans and Democrats, and that for all intents and purposes, it's a corrupt political corporate ruling class that is authoritarian, and that is dangerous, and that is growing like a cancer.
[01:29:23.558 --> 01:29:25.300]  Well, let's get your take on the world.
[01:29:25.340 --> 01:29:27.722]  Talk about your latest book in just five, six minutes.
[01:29:27.762 --> 01:29:38.874]  We have left on the other side with Chris Hedges, Pulitzer Prize winning American journalist, author and war correspondent, former head of the New York Times Bureau in the Middle East.
[01:29:38.894 --> 01:29:42.958]  We'll be right back with our guest straight ahead and we'll give you his website as well.
[01:29:42.978 --> 01:29:43.699]  Stay with us.
[01:29:50.034 --> 01:29:53.035]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.936 --> 01:29:56.717]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.779 --> 01:30:04.601]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are, a decade into the 21st century?
[01:30:04.921 --> 01:30:08.683]  Record foreclosure rates for homes, if not yours, your neighbor's.
[01:30:09.083 --> 01:30:18.528]  Thankful for the unemployment check since you were laid off, and placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[01:30:19.008 --> 01:30:22.250]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?
[01:30:22.270 --> 01:30:27.173]  The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control.
[01:30:27.473 --> 01:30:28.734]  Your greatest dependency.
[01:30:29.014 --> 01:30:30.075]  Your food supply.
[01:30:30.415 --> 01:30:34.278]  Make 2012 the year you take control by getting prepared.
[01:30:34.618 --> 01:30:38.901]  eFoods Direct introduces the best way to build your food supply in the 21st century.

[01:31:00.404 --> 01:31:04.627]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:04.947 --> 01:31:05.548]  Number 1.
[01:31:05.868 --> 01:31:09.010]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:09.291 --> 01:31:09.851]  Number 2.
[01:31:10.151 --> 01:31:14.695]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:15.035 --> 01:31:15.475]  It's true.
[01:31:15.775 --> 01:31:20.339]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:20.659 --> 01:31:21.199]  Number 3.
[01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:24.762]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:25.062 --> 01:31:28.745]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:28.965 --> 01:31:29.506]  Number 4.
[01:31:29.766 --> 01:31:32.128]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:32.528 --> 01:31:35.912]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:36.212 --> 01:31:36.412]  Number 5.
[01:31:36.993 --> 01:31:40.916]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:41.136 --> 01:31:45.901]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:46.181 --> 01:31:50.204]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:50.364 --> 01:31:51.925]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:32:02.110 --> 01:32:05.751]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:06.071 --> 01:32:14.193]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:32:14.933 --> 01:32:18.974]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:32:19.554 --> 01:32:30.376]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:32:31.016 --> 01:32:40.018]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:40.518 --> 01:32:45.559]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:53.121]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:53.441 --> 01:32:56.202]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:33:08.023 --> 01:33:09.007]  Yeah.
[01:33:13.405 --> 01:33:15.446]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:15.626 --> 01:33:16.246]  to 2 p.m.
[01:33:16.266 --> 01:33:16.706]  Central.
[01:33:16.746 --> 01:33:17.406]  We're here live.
[01:33:17.467 --> 01:33:19.627]  I come back live Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:20.147 --> 01:33:29.631]  We also have InfoWars Nightly News and InfoWarsNews.com that we've been beta testing the last five months for television that PrisonPlanet.tv viewers can watch.
[01:33:29.651 --> 01:33:38.014]  We have a 15-day free trial subscription running right there and then of course those of you that support the site you're basically paying for it for everybody else which is great.
[01:33:38.514 --> 01:33:44.283]  We then put it on YouTube and everywhere else a few days later and it gets millions of views every week and it's only five months.
[01:33:46.437 --> 01:33:49.318]  In existence, we're putting a lot of time and energy obviously into this.
[01:33:49.899 --> 01:33:52.099]  More energy than we do even in the radio show.
[01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:57.262]  So if you're not a viewer of it, now is the time to support the alternative true independent media.
[01:33:57.982 --> 01:34:06.346]  Now going back to Chris Hedges, the best website to read his amazing essays is truthdig.com forward slash Chris Hedges.
[01:34:06.366 --> 01:34:09.227]  That's truthdig.com forward slash Chris Hedges.
[01:34:10.107 --> 01:34:17.271]  Also, I was asking which book he thinks is the most important right now, and it's actually not his group of essays from last year, The World As We Know It.
[01:34:17.651 --> 01:34:19.092]  It's Death of the Liberal Class.
[01:34:19.812 --> 01:34:32.479]  And I wanted, in the six, seven minutes we have left with him, to kind of give him the floor to talk about whatever he thinks is most important and where he sees this society going right now.
[01:34:32.539 --> 01:34:32.839]  Chris?
[01:34:33.359 --> 01:34:38.662]  Well, I think that the mistake is that the liberal class is somehow meant to be the political left.
[01:34:39.437 --> 01:34:45.759]  The liberal class is the kind of safety valve that makes incremental and piecemeal reform possible.
[01:34:46.599 --> 01:34:48.620]  That's what you saw with Roosevelt and the New Deal.
[01:34:50.340 --> 01:35:00.363]  And what's happened is that essentially traditional liberal politicians, as well as the Democratic Party, have become completely hostage to corporate power.
[01:35:00.844 --> 01:35:04.965]  So you get the rise of self-identified liberals like Bill Clinton.
[01:35:06.087 --> 01:35:27.800]  To push through NAFTA, which is the greatest betrayal of working men and women in this country since the Taft-Harley Act, who deregulate the FCC so that Rupert Murdoch and Clear Channel can buy up thousands of stations, who rip down the firewalls between commercial and investment banks, known as the Glass-Steagall Act.
[01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:31.142]  All this is done under Clinton, including, of course, the destruction of welfare.
[01:35:31.522 --> 01:35:33.644]  So these are, you know, a kind of
[01:35:34.224 --> 01:35:40.467]  Betrayal of core liberal values done by the liberal establishment for corporate money.
[01:35:40.927 --> 01:35:44.449]  And Clinton knew that if he did corporate bidding, he would get that money.
[01:35:44.569 --> 01:35:52.013]  So that by the 1990s, the Democratic Party, in terms of corporate dollars, has fundraising parity with the Republicans.
[01:35:52.093 --> 01:35:54.134]  And by the time Barack Obama runs for president,
[01:35:54.754 --> 01:35:56.535]  In 2004, he gets more.
[01:35:57.796 --> 01:35:58.756]  And that is the issue.
[01:35:59.197 --> 01:36:15.746]  That the popular movements, the populist movements that expressed the sentiments from the base, whether those were old labor unions or the Wobblies or an independent press, they were pretty much destroyed in the Red Scare.
[01:36:17.487 --> 01:36:21.509]  And you just mentioned the attacks against Ron Paul in the name of sort of being
[01:36:22.663 --> 01:36:29.148]  Soft on terrorism, or I think you even said that he was accused of being a terrorist himself.
[01:36:29.168 --> 01:36:31.851]  I mean, that's what they would have done 50 years ago to discredit him.
[01:36:31.931 --> 01:36:34.373]  They would have said he's soft on communism.
[01:36:35.774 --> 01:36:45.161]  It's exactly the same kind of iconography, the same kind of language that's used by the power elite to discredit legitimate criticism and legitimate dissent.
[01:36:45.922 --> 01:36:47.483]  And I think that that's what's happening.
[01:36:47.523 --> 01:36:49.205]  The anger over the liberal class
[01:36:49.845 --> 01:36:50.846]  Is not misplaced.
[01:36:52.567 --> 01:37:14.425]  People have been betrayed by these figures like Obama, like Clinton, like Pelosi, like Carl Lepin, like the leadership of the Democratic Party that speaks in that traditional feel-your-pain language and yet carries out policies that are as craven to corporate interests as those that are carried out by the Republican Party.
[01:37:15.489 --> 01:37:22.614]  Well, looking at these big corporate interests, I mean, we see people like the head of MF Global making 40 to 1 bets with other people's money.
[01:37:23.575 --> 01:37:25.836]  Corzine gets caught lying in Congress.
[01:37:27.417 --> 01:37:30.299]  The head of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange says, no, we were there.
[01:37:30.379 --> 01:37:30.739]  He knew.
[01:37:30.779 --> 01:37:33.241]  Of course he gave the order to take the private accounts.
[01:37:33.781 --> 01:37:34.942]  And no one gets in trouble.
[01:37:35.302 --> 01:37:40.446]  I mean, there's a new level of just getting away with everything.
[01:37:40.566 --> 01:37:44.209]  And when you learn that this corporate insider crony capitalist class
[01:37:45.249 --> 01:37:48.471]  Look at Goldman Sachs.
[01:37:49.112 --> 01:37:52.034]  They're bailed out with taxpayer money, and then they're given virtually interest-free loans.
[01:38:10.754 --> 01:38:11.254]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:38:30.100 --> 01:38:44.011]  And at a higher level, you're right, derivatives are... What about people like Cass Sunstein openly putting out papers saying, we'll arrest people we disagree with, but first, we'll just have takedown orders of their sites on the web, and then we see that in SOPA.
[01:38:44.071 --> 01:38:52.758]  I mean, the thing is, they're so honest about their authoritarianism, and then we get criticized for being gloom and doomers.
[01:38:54.099 --> 01:38:58.583]  Yeah, well, they are rather amazingly honest about it, because they think they're untouchable.
[01:38:59.891 --> 01:39:05.453]  Uh, and you see that with the kinds of statements made by figures like Lloyd Blankfein from Goldman Sachs.
[01:39:06.494 --> 01:39:08.254]  God's work!
[01:39:08.274 --> 01:39:09.215]  They own the process.
[01:39:09.755 --> 01:39:11.015]  They know they own the process.
[01:39:12.396 --> 01:39:20.159]  Uh, and, um, and they feel that there is no, and they're right, internally, there is no power that can touch them.
[01:39:20.759 --> 01:39:23.260]  Either from the judicial branch or the legislative branch.
[01:39:24.436 --> 01:39:37.820]  And that's why I think they see the rise of the Occupy movements and other grassroots movements as such a threat, because that anger and that outrage is being expressed outside the system.
[01:39:38.141 --> 01:39:42.442]  And so they're looking for all the tools they can, whether it's SOPA or the NDAA or anything else.
[01:39:45.998 --> 01:40:03.921]  Well, you're right, and I mean, in closing, at first they tried to co-opt it, and when we saw all these big bank heads endorse it and Obama endorse it, but as soon as they couldn't co-opt it, we now learned there was simultaneous Homeland Security coordination sweeping them off the streets, violating
[01:40:04.762 --> 01:40:07.924]  Basic Bill of Rights, like Tiananmen Square or something.
[01:40:07.944 --> 01:40:10.525]  I mean, it's really scary.
[01:40:10.745 --> 01:40:17.648]  And I think what's going to bring these guys down, I want your take on this in closing, Chris, we appreciate your time, is their own hubris.
[01:40:17.688 --> 01:40:27.753]  That they think that they can get away with anything, and that they're going to start a war with the wrong group, or engage in too many Ponzi bets.
[01:40:28.033 --> 01:40:28.434]  I mean, take 888.
[01:40:29.514 --> 01:40:55.794]  We now know from DC Insiders, it came out in New Yorker Magazine, that Cheney, basically with NATO, tried to test Russia and see if they could push into South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and the Russians rolled in missiles, their chairman of their Joint Chiefs of Staff, it was on European TV but not here, because we're kept in the dark, and said, okay, we're going to use nuclear weapons on the NATO forces landing in southern Georgia, and the United States and NATO blinked and pulled back.
[01:40:55.854 --> 01:40:56.614]  But it shows
[01:40:57.515 --> 01:40:58.856]  Yeah, I think it's a corrupt and pretty rotten.
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:19.220]  We're good to go.
[01:41:32.774 --> 01:41:35.076]  What they have to offer, which is essentially force.
[01:41:35.876 --> 01:41:44.502]  Instead of responding to the legitimate demands that push people into those encampments, they try to physically erase them.
[01:41:45.403 --> 01:41:57.010]  Instead of addressing the foreclosures and bank repossessions, the massive unemployment, the staggering student debt, they think they can wipe these encampments and the problem will go away.
[01:41:57.391 --> 01:42:00.673]  And I think that's a window into how calcified and out of touch they are.
[01:42:01.550 --> 01:42:08.911]  Yeah, and instead, it's probably going to cause a violent revolution, which as you know, usually doesn't go too well in history, and I want to try to avoid.
[01:42:09.852 --> 01:42:12.872]  Is there any way, in your view, to navigate out of this?
[01:42:13.272 --> 01:42:20.574]  Well, you know, I've spent a lot of time with the Occupy movement, because as somebody who's spent 20 years as a war correspondent, I know the poison of violence.
[01:42:20.674 --> 01:42:26.255]  I know what it does, you know, even when it's used in an ostensibly just cause.
[01:42:27.865 --> 01:42:32.046]  I think that we have to push as hard as we can.
[01:42:32.066 --> 01:42:33.987]  I think the state will push back.
[01:42:34.187 --> 01:42:35.807]  They clearly already are pushing back.
[01:42:37.608 --> 01:42:43.090]  But when legitimate forms of dissent are crushed, you're right.
[01:42:43.150 --> 01:42:44.970]  You inevitably get a violent response.
[01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:46.171]  I hope we don't get there.
[01:42:46.851 --> 01:42:53.673]  And I was arrested in front of Goldman Sachs as part of an Occupy demonstration because I think civil disobedience is, at this point,
[01:42:54.341 --> 01:43:05.208]  The only weapon that perhaps can support this slide into what the political philosopher Sheldon Wolin calls our system of inverted totalitarianism.
[01:43:06.029 --> 01:43:17.116]  Wow, well thank you Chris for your time and people can find the latest book, well the one you're saying is most important right now, Death of Liberal Class 2010, also The World As It Is.
[01:43:17.176 --> 01:43:18.317]  Thank you so much for your time.
[01:43:19.431 --> 01:43:19.811]  Thank you.
[01:43:20.472 --> 01:43:21.973]  Well, he certainly got a lot of courage.
[01:43:21.993 --> 01:43:30.979]  He is suing Obama for NDAA, and again, the system always tries to make it either-or, and it's in that nuance that people get confused.
[01:43:31.940 --> 01:43:35.002]  The system knew that there were all these people disenfranchised.
[01:43:35.302 --> 01:43:40.105]  In fact, what was it, 15 suicides or something in the last three days in Morocco?
[01:43:40.506 --> 01:43:45.069]  People setting themselves on fire because there's millions of people who can't get jobs?
[01:43:46.721 --> 01:43:50.086]  These aren't lazy people setting themselves on fire in Morocco.
[01:43:50.927 --> 01:43:55.013]  I was reading where the Greeks are putting their kids out on the streets because they can't feed them.
[01:43:56.317 --> 01:44:07.341]  And thousands of Greek islands, they have thousands of islands, are being handed over, some of them worth billions apiece, to private brokerage firm heads for debt that Greece signed on to.
[01:44:08.322 --> 01:44:10.963]  Because the fraudsters sold them derivatives.
[01:44:11.463 --> 01:44:18.166]  Now there's the latest, they're kind of doling them out as they happen, that's Moroccan dies after setting himself on fire.
[01:44:18.186 --> 01:44:20.147]  I guess that's the latest who died.
[01:44:21.184 --> 01:44:25.817]  So, all of this is happening, but then you'll hear me criticizing Occupy Wall Street.
[01:44:25.877 --> 01:44:26.158]  No, no, no.
[01:44:27.130 --> 01:44:33.372]  The system knows that there's people, they've got computerized actuaries, they know there's already demonstrations forming everywhere.
[01:44:33.872 --> 01:44:36.553]  I mean, we could predict the Tea Party, you know, years before it happened.
[01:44:37.374 --> 01:44:38.334]  Gerald Cilente could.
[01:44:38.534 --> 01:44:39.514]  You could see these trends.
[01:44:39.534 --> 01:44:44.116]  Well, they've got computers that do it, off of what people are actually writing and saying and doing.
[01:44:44.456 --> 01:44:51.198]  These computers thin-slice giant sections of data and, you know, come up with incredibly accurate projections.
[01:44:51.639 --> 01:44:54.980]  And so they just put out an announcement, everybody who's mad at Wall Street corruption and bailouts,
[01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:56.541]  Show up here.
[01:44:57.021 --> 01:45:00.644]  So you get liberals, conservatives, libertarians, anarchists, they're all down there.
[01:45:01.184 --> 01:45:04.426]  And then in comes Soros and the White House-controlled people.
[01:45:04.927 --> 01:45:07.989]  And they try to go, yes, the answer is raise taxes on the middle class.
[01:45:10.370 --> 01:45:14.353]  And Warren Buffett comes out and endorses it and says, that's right, do what they say.
[01:45:14.734 --> 01:45:17.736]  Because he's written the tax laws where he's exempt.
[01:45:18.176 --> 01:45:19.017]  So has Mitt Romney.
[01:45:20.262 --> 01:45:23.283]  Again, you're taught it's either rich guys or poor people.
[01:45:23.343 --> 01:45:23.743]  No, no, no.
[01:45:24.383 --> 01:45:41.027]  Normal middle class folks, worth a million bucks, five million, three hundred thousand, whatever it is, that whole strata, that's who actually gets their hair cut, buys clothes, goes to a golf course, puts their kid in college, buys electronics, goes to your restaurant.
[01:45:41.347 --> 01:45:43.988]  The bigger the middle class, the more prosperous.
[01:45:44.308 --> 01:45:46.829]  Because people in the working class can then get into that class,
[01:45:47.549 --> 01:45:48.289]  And it swells.
[01:45:48.329 --> 01:45:50.890]  But the bigger the middle class, always the freer a society.
[01:45:51.270 --> 01:45:55.010]  And the tinier the elite, and the fact that they can't monopolize control.
[01:45:55.610 --> 01:45:56.451]  And they don't like that.
[01:45:56.531 --> 01:45:57.931]  They want to be in charge.
[01:45:59.911 --> 01:46:02.812]  And just as Chris Hedges said, this isn't even capitalism.
[01:46:02.872 --> 01:46:11.953]  See, the Occupy people with the George Soros signs that trucks were pulling up on record, handing out, you know, fake signs that looked like they were homemade, was in capitalism.
[01:46:12.513 --> 01:46:13.453]  In the free market.
[01:46:14.534 --> 01:46:16.134]  Capitalism didn't do this.
[01:46:17.250 --> 01:46:23.914]  This isn't capitalism where six banks run the government and steal $27 trillion and buy up the media with it.
[01:46:25.034 --> 01:46:31.958]  And then we've got to bail them out, and then they loan us our money back, and then lecture us?
[01:46:32.378 --> 01:46:44.945]  I mean, I'll see Larry Summers, and I'll see Geithner, and I'll see Clinton, and I'll see all the people that engineered the end of Glass-Steagall.
[01:46:46.932 --> 01:46:51.313]  And boy, they sort of get the military ready for martial law the minute they did, because they knew where this was going.
[01:46:51.633 --> 01:46:53.774]  You build a bubble like that, that's an awesome thing to do.
[01:46:54.074 --> 01:46:55.314]  And when it pops, look out.
[01:46:55.674 --> 01:46:57.114]  Well, they're gonna out of that chaos.
[01:46:57.134 --> 01:47:00.715]  They get power as it pumps up, but they get the real power when it implodes.
[01:47:01.835 --> 01:47:05.236]  And I was reading the people at the Davos event this morning.
[01:47:05.596 --> 01:47:06.917]  John Bowne printed it off for me.
[01:47:09.372 --> 01:47:14.216]  I mean, it's the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the royalty, all of the elites.
[01:47:14.236 --> 01:47:16.558]  It's kind of like a public Bilderberg meeting.
[01:47:17.539 --> 01:47:23.424]  And they come out and say, we're here to have a new capitalism where we're going to raise taxes to help the poor.
[01:47:24.245 --> 01:47:25.426]  We're going to get the rich people.
[01:47:25.446 --> 01:47:30.070]  And they have all these rich guys sit up there and say, I only pay 4% tax.
[01:47:30.210 --> 01:47:31.090]  That's not fair.
[01:47:31.671 --> 01:47:32.231]  I only pay 2%.
[01:47:32.692 --> 01:47:33.993]  I only pay 10.
[01:47:34.533 --> 01:47:35.634]  Well, Mitt Romney, he pays 15.
[01:47:35.694 --> 01:47:37.176]  You know, that's not right.
[01:47:37.915 --> 01:47:38.436]  You know what?
[01:47:39.037 --> 01:47:42.422]  We've always been totally greedy and will destroy your companies to consolidate them.
[01:47:42.803 --> 01:47:43.845]  But now we care!
[01:47:44.345 --> 01:47:45.427]  Raise the taxes!
[01:47:45.447 --> 01:47:46.829]  And then you actually see the tax plan?
[01:47:48.706 --> 01:47:52.969]  It cuts the taxes for the elite, who already pay almost no tax.
[01:47:53.489 --> 01:47:55.131]  It says, oh, we're just gonna give you a tax holiday.
[01:47:55.151 --> 01:48:00.214]  You can bring back your 18 trillion back into the United States out of the Cayman Islands tax-free.
[01:48:00.715 --> 01:48:07.740]  That'll, oh yeah, let's cut your taxes to zero, because most of the money's bailout money you've already got.
[01:48:09.461 --> 01:48:13.824]  And you'll never hear this from a Neocon talk show host, because they're owned by these people.
[01:48:16.421 --> 01:48:22.605]  Instead, the neocons will fight the controlled opposition left calling for socialism and communism and an end to capitalism.
[01:48:23.125 --> 01:48:24.206]  But who's financing it?
[01:48:24.286 --> 01:48:25.647]  The very same big bankers!
[01:48:26.307 --> 01:48:32.351]  To then have the blue-collar public and the welfare class under them attack
[01:48:33.271 --> 01:48:37.795]  What's left of the middle class, and the globalists are offshore, exempt from all of it, and a big joke!
[01:48:38.315 --> 01:48:42.798]  And then now the system's pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing for armed conflict with the American people.
[01:48:43.259 --> 01:48:50.004]  Training the military, training the police, trying to get a civil war going, and again, they're all gonna sit offshore while we all kill each other.
[01:48:51.685 --> 01:48:59.131]  And I know all these vets and people out there who publicly say, when this all goes down, look out police and military that come after us.
[01:49:00.674 --> 01:49:01.034]  You know what?
[01:49:01.074 --> 01:49:02.015]  That makes my heart hurt.
[01:49:03.056 --> 01:49:09.863]  Sure, I don't like some arrogant right-head cop that likes to beat people up or, you know, some military person that's dumb enough to go up against domestic groups.
[01:49:10.964 --> 01:49:15.088]  But I know they're going to be following some brainwashing template, some cover story.
[01:49:15.969 --> 01:49:17.030]  And I care about them.
[01:49:17.610 --> 01:49:19.953]  I'm not... I'm beyond macho, folks.
[01:49:20.013 --> 01:49:21.434]  I'm beyond tough guy.
[01:49:21.754 --> 01:49:23.416]  To the point of I don't want to go there.
[01:49:23.536 --> 01:49:25.218]  I want to defeat the actual controllers.
[01:49:26.109 --> 01:49:30.656]  I'm not all, I'll just have a war with the local cops.
[01:49:31.557 --> 01:49:34.522]  Local cops are just like your neighbor, just like the general public.
[01:49:34.562 --> 01:49:36.104]  They have no idea what's going on.
[01:49:36.665 --> 01:49:39.789]  We've got to, instead of just buying guns, which I do think is a good backup.
[01:49:40.455 --> 01:49:41.375]  We got to defend ourselves.
[01:49:41.435 --> 01:49:42.696]  Let's not make a mistake about that.
[01:49:43.016 --> 01:49:47.417]  But if you're to the point of buying a bunch of guns, getting ready for war, and just ready?
[01:49:47.437 --> 01:49:51.559]  There are a lot of folks, I want to warn the police and military, as you know, who want to die, who don't care.
[01:49:51.579 --> 01:49:56.800]  I mean, if you think their restraint is because they're afraid of you and your black uniforms scare them, it's the opposite.
[01:49:56.900 --> 01:50:02.862]  It enrages real men, who are real men but aren't sophisticated enough to understand all this.
[01:50:03.422 --> 01:50:04.803]  They're just ready to kill a bunch of you.
[01:50:06.592 --> 01:50:10.675]  Man, I would not want to be in your position with what the New World Order is trying to push you into.
[01:50:11.395 --> 01:50:16.458]  So, if a lot of people are talking about war with the government, why don't you engage in info war first?
[01:50:16.738 --> 01:50:21.621]  Why don't you try to turn this around without total war in the streets, blood in the streets?
[01:50:22.521 --> 01:50:46.969]  Why don't we try to point out capitalism didn't do this, point out the free market develops the best economies and the wealthiest general public and is the best for everybody, and point out how a small group of banksters are anti-free market and anti-family and are setting all this up and selling socialism as the solution to what they've done because it creates command and control economies that shuts down all their competition.
[01:50:47.947 --> 01:50:52.513]  It is so essential to get that message of truth out.
[01:50:53.414 --> 01:50:58.340]  Or the cops are going to follow the left for communism, or they're going to follow the controlled right for fascism.
[01:50:58.660 --> 01:50:59.821]  We don't want either one.
[01:51:02.164 --> 01:51:05.809]  That's the sound of your door being kicked in by an intruder with a single kick.
[01:51:07.185 --> 01:51:12.366]  That's the sound of the same door now protected by the Door Sentinel at MySafeDoor.com.

[01:51:31.458 --> 01:51:35.860]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:51:36.020 --> 01:51:41.762]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[01:51:41.842 --> 01:51:45.224]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[01:53:49.492 --> 01:53:50.572]  Pro-EM1, the raw probiotic.
[01:54:05.652 --> 01:54:06.713]  Okay, here's the deal.
[01:54:06.733 --> 01:54:14.520]  We're going to have open phones throughout the third hour today, jam-packed with a lot of fact toys and news pieces I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:54:15.841 --> 01:54:24.029]  But up at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, Soros mouthpiece calls on Google to police conspiracy theorist.
[01:54:25.663 --> 01:54:34.348]  And it's not just Cass Sunstein, but Stanford Scholar wants search engines to flag global warming vaccine skepticism as thought crime.
[01:54:34.969 --> 01:54:45.055]  Now, you heard me play an AP video at the start of the hour where they actually say the latest pre-crime system, and you're not watching Minority Report.
[01:54:45.816 --> 01:54:47.917]  They're actually saying it's pre-crime.
[01:54:50.345 --> 01:54:51.606]  And saying how great it is.
[01:54:51.766 --> 01:54:59.811]  And then it reads through here, and they're writing articles for Slate, there's White House announcements, Cass Sunstein.
[01:54:59.851 --> 01:55:04.675]  They're openly talking about shutting down websites and then arresting people.
[01:55:05.996 --> 01:55:07.397]  I mean, these are authoritarians.
[01:55:07.577 --> 01:55:10.018]  I mean, there's no if, ands, or buts.
[01:55:10.499 --> 01:55:15.662]  And then you got Limbaugh saying, well, Ron Paul deserves to be stopped by TSA.
[01:55:15.702 --> 01:55:17.043]  He's a Muslim terrorist.
[01:55:17.423 --> 01:55:18.024]  I mean, what?
[01:55:19.957 --> 01:55:20.937]  And it's not funny!
[01:55:21.658 --> 01:55:25.139]  I'm not going to put up with you globalist traitors claiming we're the traitors!
[01:55:25.719 --> 01:55:26.519]  I'm sick of it!
[01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:30.640]  Now, speaking, this is weird.
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:38.623]  I've seen this five, six, seven years ago, about six months ago, I just typed into YouTube, George Soros, 60 Minutes interview.
[01:55:39.703 --> 01:55:44.645]  And you would get, I'm not joking, dozens and dozens, page after page of him on 60 Minutes,
[01:55:46.044 --> 01:55:48.426]  I think it was about 1999 or 2000.
[01:55:48.726 --> 01:55:51.689]  Actually, I have the date here.
[01:55:51.709 --> 01:55:58.574]  1998 interview with Steve Croft where he talked about how great it was working for the Nazis and he doesn't feel bad about it.
[01:55:59.677 --> 01:56:08.721]  He must have had all of that expunged off of the web when Glenn Beck talked about it earlier in the year, copying our show, talking about it, which is fine.
[01:56:08.741 --> 01:56:09.161]  I'm glad.
[01:56:09.181 --> 01:56:11.582]  It's like an auxiliary of my broadcast.
[01:56:11.622 --> 01:56:12.583]  I'm very proud of it, actually.
[01:56:13.723 --> 01:56:13.963]  I am.
[01:56:14.364 --> 01:56:16.044]  Have we come out with a new special on the website?
[01:56:16.084 --> 01:56:17.065]  He copies it exactly.
[01:56:17.085 --> 01:56:18.425]  The truth lives there.
[01:56:18.445 --> 01:56:19.626]  I always said the truth lived here.
[01:56:20.146 --> 01:56:21.707]  You know, give the gift of truth at Christmas.
[01:56:21.747 --> 01:56:22.567]  He gives the gift of truth.
[01:56:22.627 --> 01:56:22.987]  I love it.
[01:56:24.548 --> 01:56:28.551]  It's like a clone, like a little twisted clone, but he's getting closer to me, so that's good.
[01:56:28.992 --> 01:56:30.573]  Good to see my son coming along.
[01:56:31.834 --> 01:56:35.317]  But here's from the Zionist Organization of America.
[01:56:35.417 --> 01:56:38.139]  It's troubling to see the Jewish leaders defend Israel.
[01:56:41.702 --> 01:56:42.022]  U.S.
[01:56:42.082 --> 01:56:42.563]  basher.
[01:56:43.023 --> 01:56:45.745]  Again, it's troubling to see Jewish leaders defend Israel, U.S.
[01:56:45.805 --> 01:56:48.047]  basher George Soros against Glenn Beck's criticism.
[01:56:48.407 --> 01:56:50.269]  And then they actually have the transcript here.
[01:56:52.742 --> 01:56:57.744]  Of George Soros talking about working for the Nazis.
[01:56:58.525 --> 01:57:00.906]  And I'm going to go over this transcript and everything tonight, but here's the deal.
[01:57:01.166 --> 01:57:02.326]  We're getting hundreds of emails.
[01:57:02.386 --> 01:57:03.707]  Nobody else can find it now.
[01:57:04.327 --> 01:57:07.088]  It's been removed from the BitTorrents.
[01:57:07.188 --> 01:57:09.689]  It's been removed from YouTube, Google Video.
[01:57:10.130 --> 01:57:11.270]  It's been removed everywhere.
[01:57:11.370 --> 01:57:13.731]  If you find it, you need to save it.
[01:57:16.432 --> 01:57:18.573]  And it's from 1998.
[01:57:18.713 --> 01:57:20.374]  I played clips of this years ago.
[01:57:21.385 --> 01:57:22.165]  1998 interview.
[01:57:22.365 --> 01:57:24.827]  That's the weird thing about Glenn Beck.
[01:57:26.287 --> 01:57:27.128]  December 20th, 1998.
[01:57:28.268 --> 01:57:28.928]  Steve Kroft.
[01:57:30.309 --> 01:57:37.872]  Funny thing, as used to, I like play a clip of a eugenicist, you know, calling for world population reduction, and then a month later here on Becky Pooh.
[01:57:38.373 --> 01:57:39.413]  But I mean, I'm glad of that.
[01:57:41.054 --> 01:57:46.716]  But I guess when Beck covered it, his show was so big then that they just had it removed.
[01:57:47.437 --> 01:57:50.198]  Because, I mean, that was like coffin nails to George Soros.
[01:57:51.844 --> 01:57:53.265]  Absolute coffin nails.
[01:57:53.565 --> 01:57:59.149]  And of course, George Soros' Media Matters is routinely demonizing us and attacking us on pretty much a daily basis.
[01:57:59.669 --> 01:58:21.404]  By the way, Warren Buffett, the rich guy that openly wants to raise taxes on the middle class to pay it to himself and banker bailouts, Bloomberg is reporting that Warren Buffett's Burlington Northern, among winners from Keystone denial, when they shut down that pipeline, it'll now be taken by train to the U.S., but also to the west coast of Canada to be put on tankers to China.
[01:58:22.404 --> 01:58:29.266]  And Bloomberg reports, so... See, the big guys make their money off government shutting down their competition.
[01:58:29.586 --> 01:58:33.787]  That's why John D. Rockefeller I said, competition is a sin.
[01:58:34.467 --> 01:58:37.868]  But the Neocon talk show host will never tell you that dirty secret.
[01:58:41.249 --> 01:58:42.550]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:42.730 --> 01:58:46.311]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.920 --> 01:58:55.564]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:58:55.944 --> 01:58:58.947]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:58:59.187 --> 01:59:03.951]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:59:03.971 --> 01:59:10.217]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:59:10.377 --> 01:59:12.620]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:59:13.140 --> 01:59:14.721]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:59:14.761 --> 01:59:15.641]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:59:15.742 --> 01:59:18.163]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:59:32.051 --> 01:59:33.892]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:59:34.192 --> 01:59:38.974]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:59:39.315 --> 01:59:49.259]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:59:53.581 --> 01:59:55.522]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.962 --> 01:59:58.744]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.424 --> 02:00:09.608]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.268 --> 02:00:11.069]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.850 --> 02:00:12.730]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.391 --> 02:00:16.994]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.575 --> 02:00:21.638]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.498 --> 02:00:50.511]  Well, we are the cure to the reality television watching fluoride, Prozac head, zombie population under the control of the cess stream, sewer stream, dinosaur globalist, treacherous trader, sellout, knuckle-dragger, teleprompter, reader, prostitute, New World Order servant, Benedict Arnold media.
[02:00:52.170 --> 02:00:56.093]  And I want to give, in the first 30 minutes of this hour, first-time callers a chance to call in.
[02:00:56.413 --> 02:00:57.814]  Here's the toll-free number to join us.
[02:00:57.834 --> 02:00:59.235]  I want to hear from first-time callers.
[02:00:59.816 --> 02:01:02.518]  And then after I take a few rounds, the first-time callers will go on to others.
[02:01:02.538 --> 02:01:03.078]  800-259-9231.
[02:01:03.098 --> 02:01:03.238]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:01:03.318 --> 02:01:05.960]  And we'll get you up and on the air a little bit later in the transmission.
[02:01:05.980 --> 02:01:08.142]  A little bit later, as in the next segment.
[02:01:21.820 --> 02:01:24.882]  Some of the other crazy news I've got I haven't gotten to yet.
[02:01:25.782 --> 02:01:27.583]  Mitt Romney's released more financials.
[02:01:27.623 --> 02:01:28.964]  He basically doesn't pay taxes.
[02:01:29.004 --> 02:01:30.045]  It's all in offshore banks.
[02:01:30.925 --> 02:01:38.369]  But if you make $200,000 a year, try to save $100,000 of that and put it in offshore accounts even after tax, they're going to take it.
[02:01:39.210 --> 02:01:40.811]  They made it almost impossible to get it out.
[02:01:41.311 --> 02:01:45.053]  They'll have the IRS rule it's fraud outside of law and take whatever you got.
[02:01:46.854 --> 02:01:50.256]  Only if you're a big globalist and are in the special club
[02:01:51.101 --> 02:01:51.981]  Are you allowed to do this?
[02:01:52.101 --> 02:01:55.903]  See, because we live in a two-tiered system now.
[02:01:55.923 --> 02:01:58.764]  The globalists can commit any crime they want, anytime they want.
[02:01:59.365 --> 02:02:00.825]  They have globalist immunity.
[02:02:01.525 --> 02:02:04.087]  They basically have new world order immunity from laws.
[02:02:05.027 --> 02:02:06.648]  And it's the same thing in the European Union.
[02:02:07.048 --> 02:02:09.189]  They get away with whatever they want, whenever they want.
[02:02:09.949 --> 02:02:11.610]  They're getting closer and closer to that.
[02:02:13.424 --> 02:02:24.951]  That system that Nick Rockefeller talked about, where the elite basically has a microchip inside their body, where no one can challenge them, no one can ask them questions, the police cannot touch them, they are immune.
[02:02:25.612 --> 02:02:33.237]  And they can just commit any crime they want, and get away with anything they want, and if you dare try to protest against them, the police will come and split your head open.
[02:02:34.275 --> 02:02:53.923]  And the police will have their future destroyed, their children's future destroyed, and the global eugenicist control freaks will continue to do whatever they want to the environment, put sodium fluoride in the water, vaccines will be poisoned, and they'll write white papers on how they're doing it to us, but because the general public is only talking about the NFL playoffs.
[02:02:54.844 --> 02:03:04.232]  I was listening to the radio yesterday and you could hear the talking point of, you know, talking about the Giants, I guess, are going to the playoffs, Super Bowl, something.
[02:03:04.272 --> 02:03:04.652]  I don't know.
[02:03:04.672 --> 02:03:07.695]  I don't even know where the playoffs are, what's going on with it.
[02:03:08.295 --> 02:03:10.977]  I'm too concerned with the Strait of Hormuz.
[02:03:11.037 --> 02:03:12.799]  The Iranians say they're getting ready to shut it.
[02:03:13.319 --> 02:03:13.800]  The U.S.
[02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:14.901]  says they're going to attack them.
[02:03:16.311 --> 02:03:19.134]  Oil prices go up, economy sputters even more.
[02:03:19.855 --> 02:03:22.558]  We go into deeper depression, larger war could begin.
[02:03:22.578 --> 02:03:25.422]  But again, I'm the bad person!
[02:03:27.449 --> 02:03:35.151]  Because I hear these men on the radio, and they're just like, oh, it's so great, the Giants, oh man, they're my team, oh yeah, you know.
[02:03:35.171 --> 02:03:48.695]  My wife didn't used to like football, but she came into the room, and she said, you know, I really like it now, and you know, I like to watch football by myself, and pace up and down, and yell at the TV, and my kids just come in quietly and look at me in awe.
[02:03:49.275 --> 02:03:51.676]  The other host is like, yeah, I know what you mean.
[02:03:52.496 --> 02:03:53.817]  It's so manly.
[02:03:54.844 --> 02:03:57.946]  Meanwhile I'm pacing up and down trying to figure out how to wake people up.
[02:03:58.006 --> 02:04:01.428]  I'm pacing up and down not believing how hardcore the tyranny is.
[02:04:01.868 --> 02:04:11.233]  I'm pacing up and down confirming that in the H1N1 shot they added another virus that's a carrier and appears to be some type of binary weapon.
[02:04:12.874 --> 02:04:18.357]  And it's just killing people and maiming people and the numbers are coming in and the cancer is exploding and the death.
[02:04:19.117 --> 02:04:23.800]  But I hear these men who are like in this mesmerized cult brainwashed haze
[02:04:24.687 --> 02:04:28.291]  You know, trying to impress each other with how much they love the football.
[02:04:28.331 --> 02:04:33.177]  It's just like this form of camaraderie and manhood.
[02:04:33.237 --> 02:04:40.685]  Not to their tribe, their religion, their people, their art, their culture, but this fake plastic garbage.
[02:04:41.205 --> 02:04:44.769]  And the women, totally vapid, taught how to be tarts.
[02:04:46.158 --> 02:04:54.383]  In all their shows, demonizing the men, and in every television show, the men are idiots and the women are the bosses and the children rule over them.
[02:04:54.444 --> 02:04:59.327]  Just cultural death force-fed down our throats by the globalists to make us weak.
[02:05:00.762 --> 02:05:02.023]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:02.083 --> 02:05:07.428]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:05:07.669 --> 02:05:12.293]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:05:12.674 --> 02:05:17.759]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:05:18.259 --> 02:05:22.944]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:05:23.464 --> 02:05:30.388]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:05:30.588 --> 02:05:31.489]  And here's the best part.
[02:05:31.709 --> 02:05:38.073]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:05:38.393 --> 02:05:41.235]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.

[02:06:04.666 --> 02:06:08.428]  Record foreclosure rates for homes, if not yours, your neighbors.
[02:06:08.808 --> 02:06:11.329]  Thankful for the unemployment checks since you were laid off.
[02:06:11.769 --> 02:06:18.272]  And placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[02:06:18.772 --> 02:06:21.994]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?
[02:06:22.014 --> 02:06:26.936]  The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control.
[02:06:27.216 --> 02:06:28.477]  Your greatest dependency.
[02:06:28.757 --> 02:06:29.817]  Your food supply.
[02:06:30.178 --> 02:06:34.019]  Make 2012 the year you take control by getting prepared.

[02:07:04.321 --> 02:07:05.241]  Tyranny is here.
[02:07:05.582 --> 02:07:09.503]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:07:09.523 --> 02:07:11.725]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:07:11.745 --> 02:07:17.187]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:07:17.607 --> 02:07:23.870]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:07:24.290 --> 02:07:29.833]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:07:30.273 --> 02:07:33.935]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:07:34.435 --> 02:07:38.417]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:07:38.717 --> 02:07:44.660]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:47.641]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:07:48.221 --> 02:07:49.622]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:07:50.202 --> 02:07:50.722]  It's here.
[02:07:51.323 --> 02:07:58.126]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:02.168 --> 02:08:08.191]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:08.791 --> 02:08:11.773]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:27.540 --> 02:08:30.943]  Ladies and gentlemen, the news is just pouring in.
[02:08:30.983 --> 02:08:37.408]  I'm going to go to your phone calls and then more news, but later in the day, Aaron Dykes is going to have a special report, a text report.
[02:08:37.428 --> 02:08:40.930]  In fact, this is so big, I think I'll shoot a video for it too.
[02:08:43.873 --> 02:08:55.422]  Out on Infowars.com, where there's a new congressional report with the Chertoff group, the folks that gave you the naked body scanners.
[02:08:56.684 --> 02:09:00.066]  Where they basically admit everything that we've already reverse engineered.
[02:09:00.827 --> 02:09:01.808]  But it's the admissions.
[02:09:02.708 --> 02:09:05.130]  You know, we told you TSA would be on the streets of America.
[02:09:05.611 --> 02:09:09.073]  There'd be naked body scanners everywhere, shopping malls, highway checkpoints.
[02:09:09.393 --> 02:09:14.297]  That's why they've got to break your will and do it in the airport to set that precedent.
[02:09:16.186 --> 02:09:17.587]  They've got to do it there.
[02:09:18.028 --> 02:09:22.011]  They've got to have federal funds for mobile trucks to take blood forcibly.
[02:09:22.351 --> 02:09:24.894]  They've got to get the police ready to give forced inoculations.
[02:09:25.214 --> 02:09:30.639]  So they've got to medicalize the police for medical tyranny as their little enforcers.
[02:09:30.739 --> 02:09:35.123]  But they want a federal kind of brown shirt, minimum wage,
[02:09:36.923 --> 02:09:37.924]  We're good to go.
[02:09:59.255 --> 02:10:02.777]  And ten years into this, you see the tyranny.
[02:10:02.917 --> 02:10:10.642]  Bureaucratic, arbitrary, constant lying to the public, their enemy, the incredible power trips.
[02:10:11.902 --> 02:10:18.947]  And the document he was just showing me during the break was, Homeland Security will hire everybody in America, you'll have to get their approval for a job.
[02:10:18.987 --> 02:10:22.689]  We already knew that from the hearings years ago on C-SPAN, but here it is in a document.
[02:10:23.660 --> 02:10:30.443]  There'll be checkpoints everywhere, Homeland Security with private contractors so that, you know, the establishment types make money.
[02:10:31.704 --> 02:10:33.424]  We'll hire your local police.
[02:10:33.925 --> 02:10:36.826]  You'll have to get Homeland Security approval to even hire police.
[02:10:37.226 --> 02:10:38.707]  They'll be totally federalized.
[02:10:40.047 --> 02:10:42.108]  And they admit they're going to respond to all crime.
[02:10:42.449 --> 02:10:45.890]  You'll have federal police at every city targeting the American people.
[02:10:46.330 --> 02:10:49.032]  And it has no pretense that it's for terrorists.
[02:10:49.452 --> 02:10:51.913]  It's just total federalization of everything.
[02:10:53.103 --> 02:10:55.506]  By wicked, sickening goon forces.
[02:10:56.928 --> 02:10:58.871]  And he was just showing me these documents.
[02:10:59.411 --> 02:11:00.513]  And it's all in Congress.
[02:11:01.674 --> 02:11:07.222]  And it is the military-industrial complex basically absorbing all of America.
[02:11:08.183 --> 02:11:22.356]  And the biggest group of new, in the last decade, scholarships is every facet of spying and running the systems and data mining and grids and psychology degrees on how to break the American people's will.
[02:11:22.817 --> 02:11:27.181]  I mean, using our money just building a giant army of scum and criminals.
[02:11:27.881 --> 02:11:32.706]  I mean, the government is a narcotics trafficking, child kidnapping, murdering group at the top.
[02:11:33.584 --> 02:11:46.547]  They do it with impunity, and now they are getting ready to totally shut down the entire middle class, impoverish the poor even more, and bring in forced inoculations, as the American Medical Association called for last week.
[02:11:46.987 --> 02:11:51.088]  California passed a law to forcibly inoculate children without parental consent.
[02:11:51.128 --> 02:11:52.168]  I mean, it's all happening.
[02:11:53.449 --> 02:11:59.370]  Legislation to shut down free speech, secret arrest, open calls for arresting talk show hosts.
[02:11:59.890 --> 02:12:02.772]  Limbaugh saying Ron Paul deserves to be detained.
[02:12:03.092 --> 02:12:04.332]  He might be a terrorist.
[02:12:04.833 --> 02:12:06.834]  I mean, just the cuckoo-ness is here.
[02:12:08.414 --> 02:12:12.737]  Toe-to-toe with wild-eyed criminals is what we are.
[02:12:15.638 --> 02:12:17.179]  Running around with brown shirts.
[02:12:17.219 --> 02:12:20.921]  You know, Hitler hired people for minimum wage.
[02:12:22.011 --> 02:12:28.537]  The scum of the earth, filth, pot bellies, pedophiles, rampant pedophilia, street thugs.
[02:12:29.318 --> 02:12:30.419]  Opened the prisons up.
[02:12:30.799 --> 02:12:31.880]  That was his brown shirts.
[02:12:33.101 --> 02:12:34.262]  And that is the TSA.
[02:12:34.783 --> 02:12:36.344]  I tell you, the New World Order is sophisticated.
[02:12:36.384 --> 02:12:37.185]  They know what they're doing.
[02:12:37.785 --> 02:12:40.428]  And they have just got the scum of the earth working for them.
[02:12:41.662 --> 02:13:01.097]  And they're now, again, I mean, we already knew this, but to have the document where you pull up at a checkpoint in Florida, Tennessee, Michigan, Texas, wherever, it's happening all 50 states now, and the whole highway's shut down, you gotta get somewhere, it takes you like an hour to get up to it if you try to turn around, but you notice they always do it on highways now that have the cables they've put up everywhere so you can't turn around.
[02:13:03.359 --> 02:13:04.200]  So you're stuck there.
[02:13:05.970 --> 02:13:25.736]  And when you finally get there, there are cops in some kind of weird mentally ill, as I've seen on the news, pumped out of their mind craze with their fist in balls, almost always the state police wearing Marine Corps drill sergeant hats, just crazed like, like they're a rodeo clown and a bull's about to come out of that gate.
[02:13:26.196 --> 02:13:26.897]  I mean, they're just like...
[02:13:28.905 --> 02:13:33.568]  You know, like they're about to run into a burning house, and they're just looking at you and your wife and your kids just crazed.
[02:13:33.748 --> 02:13:34.448]  This is the enemy.
[02:13:34.608 --> 02:13:35.289]  This is the enemy.
[02:13:35.329 --> 02:13:35.969]  This is the enemy.
[02:13:36.229 --> 02:13:41.072]  And there's weird potbelly TSA walking around giving orders and everything's all sick and filthy.
[02:13:41.373 --> 02:13:43.794]  I mean, God, this country is so sick.
[02:13:44.715 --> 02:13:46.335]  And they're just going to turn them loose.
[02:13:47.356 --> 02:13:52.779]  And I saw in Austin, people that go to anti-war rallies, you can type in, FBI visits anti-war rally mother.
[02:13:52.799 --> 02:14:00.563]  There's a whole bunch of, and the FBI comes with these weird women and weird, it's always a woman-man team, and they're always, look like, like a body snatcher.
[02:14:00.603 --> 02:14:10.428]  They always got this weird look in their face, the FBI does, like they're looking at scum, and they're just like, we're just here to ask why you're at the anti-war rally, making sure there's no plans for violence.
[02:14:10.967 --> 02:14:11.928]  Well, of course there's not.
[02:14:11.968 --> 02:14:12.649]  Why are you here?
[02:14:13.590 --> 02:14:14.531]  I'm not going to talk to you.
[02:14:14.551 --> 02:14:16.793]  They're like, well, here's our car.
[02:14:16.813 --> 02:14:17.994]  We just want you to know we're here.
[02:14:18.014 --> 02:14:23.239]  And then they just kind of creep back, not turning their back as the mother closes the door like body snatchers.
[02:14:23.279 --> 02:14:27.123]  I mean, they're just in they're like filled with demonic entities or something.
[02:14:27.163 --> 02:14:28.745]  I mean, it's like they're not human.
[02:14:29.145 --> 02:14:44.141]  I mean, but really they're just a stupid man and woman on a power trip feeding off trying to scare the woman and getting off on their suburban they pull up in and ooh they are scaring everyone because they're little Jack Bowers.
[02:14:44.401 --> 02:14:47.865]  No, you work for sicko child kidnapping murderers!
[02:14:48.365 --> 02:14:55.751]  Dying Corp, Halliburton, New World Order, shipping narcotics in, running every crime, jacking your food and water with poisons.
[02:14:56.011 --> 02:15:00.775]  You're little nothing errand boys of the most scientific evil the world's ever seen.
[02:15:00.975 --> 02:15:07.440]  But out of your cowardice and weakness, you're gonna curl up at the feet of the evil, and you will help destroy America!
[02:15:07.680 --> 02:15:09.882]  And you will be judged by your own evil!
[02:15:12.793 --> 02:15:19.801]  But I'm telling you, I mean, I mean, you watch the FBI guys and the FBI women in these videos and they all look the same.
[02:15:20.221 --> 02:15:20.982]  They always have like this.
[02:15:21.783 --> 02:15:22.363]  I can't do it.
[02:15:22.403 --> 02:15:24.145]  Let me try to like, just imagine what they look like.
[02:15:24.165 --> 02:15:25.447]  You can pull the video up, actually.
[02:15:25.927 --> 02:15:28.009]  We can show people watching on presentplanet.tv.
[02:15:28.610 --> 02:15:30.051]  I can try to get the, I have to like.
[02:15:31.132 --> 02:15:44.705]  Envision what it's like being weak, being empty, being totally cowardly, and so fearful that I get off on other people's fear, and I like being a political officer of the Commissar New World Order, and the apparatchik, and going to people's doors.
[02:15:44.745 --> 02:15:52.212]  Let me just imagine the criminal, spiritual, demonic weakness of it, and then let me try to make the face here.
[02:16:05.715 --> 02:16:06.396]  I can't even do it.
[02:16:06.436 --> 02:16:07.917]  I'm not, I just, I can't do it.
[02:16:07.937 --> 02:16:16.144]  But it's like a bottomless scum, bottomless evil, bottomless just giving their soul to every demonic entity you can imagine.
[02:16:16.204 --> 02:16:16.924]  That's who they are.
[02:16:17.164 --> 02:16:25.992]  Just the insufferable, little pot-bellied, weak, sissy types who think they've got strength and they have nothing!
[02:16:26.012 --> 02:16:27.693]  Oh, God.
[02:16:29.154 --> 02:16:30.195]  I gotta stop right now.
[02:16:30.315 --> 02:16:32.237]  Just channeling those people is just too painful.
[02:16:34.815 --> 02:16:36.538]  Oh, I can't even imagine it.
[02:16:36.578 --> 02:16:37.339]  No, that's not it.
[02:16:37.399 --> 02:16:44.790]  Type into YouTube, FBI visits woman for going to FBI.
[02:16:45.351 --> 02:16:48.216]  I mean, FBI visits woman for going to any war rally.
[02:16:50.219 --> 02:16:52.600]  There's a bunch of them, because they mainly prey on women.
[02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:54.281]  The cops do knock and talk.
[02:16:54.321 --> 02:16:58.183]  You notice in Dallas, the Dallas Morning News reported always at about noon, one o'clock.
[02:16:58.484 --> 02:17:00.825]  They've cased the houses, they know the husband leaves.
[02:17:01.465 --> 02:17:04.887]  They mark it down on a sheet beforehand as part of a spying grid for the feds.
[02:17:05.147 --> 02:17:08.469]  Then they go and talk to your wife and ask if they can come in and see your legal guns.
[02:17:08.869 --> 02:17:15.693]  They're just practicing a criminal operation, practicing a sacrament of their treason.
[02:17:16.273 --> 02:17:18.915]  It's a religion of desecrating our republic.
[02:17:21.129 --> 02:17:22.250]  I said I'd take your phone calls.
[02:17:22.410 --> 02:17:24.992]  I shouldn't even have thought about the face of that FBI woman.
[02:17:27.054 --> 02:17:29.537]  That's the same face that's taken down so many countries.
[02:17:29.797 --> 02:17:30.337]  Oh my God.
[02:17:31.578 --> 02:17:33.620]  They have no idea what they're opening.
[02:17:33.640 --> 02:17:35.482]  It doesn't matter.
[02:17:35.502 --> 02:17:36.323]  They'll soon find out.
[02:17:37.123 --> 02:17:38.344]  Greg in California.
[02:17:38.384 --> 02:17:39.205]  Greg, you're on the air.
[02:17:39.245 --> 02:17:39.686]  Go ahead.
[02:17:39.706 --> 02:17:42.708]  Hello, Alex.
[02:17:43.028 --> 02:17:43.329]  Yes, sir.
[02:17:44.502 --> 02:17:46.224]  Yeah, hey, I wanted to say hi.
[02:17:46.264 --> 02:17:47.625]  I'm calling from California.
[02:17:47.766 --> 02:17:49.027]  West Sacramento, actually.
[02:17:49.047 --> 02:17:50.969]  Hey, awesome job.
[02:17:52.331 --> 02:17:56.375]  I listen to you every day and so does my other friend that came with me.
[02:17:56.435 --> 02:17:57.136]  We went up there.
[02:17:57.596 --> 02:18:00.359]  We met you in Coconut Grove back in October of 2010.
[02:18:00.399 --> 02:18:02.782]  Yeah, that was great coming to that event.
[02:18:02.802 --> 02:18:04.604]  We had two sellout crowds of like 900 each night.
[02:18:06.693 --> 02:18:07.894]  Yeah, you were doing awesome.
[02:18:08.054 --> 02:18:12.538]  And that was the night also when the one sheriff, Sheriff Mack, was there with you.
[02:18:12.618 --> 02:18:16.681]  And, you know, it's awesome that you have good people on your side.
[02:18:16.761 --> 02:18:19.984]  And, you know, I've been doing a lot of my own.
[02:18:20.504 --> 02:18:24.747]  I put your stickers on my car, arrest the feds, you know, all that stuff.
[02:18:24.807 --> 02:18:26.529]  I mean, and the feds, arrest the bankers.
[02:18:27.149 --> 02:18:28.209]  You know, it's all true.
[02:18:29.050 --> 02:18:32.951]  It's just so crazy out there that there's people out there that just don't see it yet.
[02:18:33.511 --> 02:18:35.352]  A lot of people are waking up, thank God.
[02:18:36.452 --> 02:18:45.815]  But I wanted to say something about the election when Ron Paul, Mitt Romney, and I forget who the other one was, but they were all tied at 23%.
[02:18:47.096 --> 02:18:50.937]  And it made me wonder because they showed
[02:18:52.499 --> 02:18:57.205]  They showed Ron Paul and Mitt Romney tied at 23% and then it dropped.
[02:18:57.365 --> 02:18:59.628]  Ron Paul went from 23 to 21.
[02:18:59.888 --> 02:19:03.993]  I swear, I recorded it on my TV and I thought, how is this going on?
[02:19:04.494 --> 02:19:08.759]  Sir, CBS is reporting he's going to get zero delegates in Iowa now.
[02:19:12.671 --> 02:19:17.873]  Sir, on record, he's supposed to get the third amount, which is a whole bunch of them.
[02:19:17.893 --> 02:19:18.713]  They just don't care.
[02:19:18.733 --> 02:19:21.774]  They know the public only knows about football.
[02:19:22.554 --> 02:19:28.415]  And so, you know, DynCorp can publicly operate in Austin as the CPS grabbing children and nobody cares.
[02:19:28.455 --> 02:19:33.236]  I mean, that's what I mean, because it can't happen here because we got football, man.
[02:19:34.376 --> 02:19:35.337]  We got football here.
[02:19:35.837 --> 02:19:36.517]  That's not happening.
[02:19:38.875 --> 02:19:41.517]  No, no, I hear you.
[02:19:41.677 --> 02:19:42.798]  I don't hate football either.
[02:19:42.818 --> 02:19:47.582]  The point is, is that men sit around and like, I really get upset about football.
[02:19:47.682 --> 02:19:48.703]  Oh, you're so manly.
[02:19:49.203 --> 02:19:52.446]  Their whole identity is like running around like little ninnies.
[02:19:53.046 --> 02:19:53.867]  I appreciate your call.
[02:19:53.887 --> 02:19:55.448]  I'm gonna try to go to him quicker on the other side.
[02:19:56.829 --> 02:19:58.530]  Oh, and I haven't even gotten a bunch of the news yet.
[02:19:58.550 --> 02:19:59.111]  Stay with us.
[02:19:59.251 --> 02:19:59.952]  Oh, my gosh.
[02:20:00.112 --> 02:20:00.692]  Oh, boy.
[02:20:00.893 --> 02:20:05.557]  After work, I just want to plop down on the couch and watch TV alone.
[02:20:05.878 --> 02:20:06.518]  Come on.
[02:20:06.658 --> 02:20:07.479]  Don't be like that.
[02:20:07.719 --> 02:20:08.320]  Who are you?
[02:20:08.340 --> 02:20:16.188]  I'm you, 20 years ago, when you were full of energy, better shape, great attitude, and you didn't do so bad with the ladies.
[02:20:16.528 --> 02:20:21.429]  Now that you're older, your testosterone levels are dropping and, well, you're not the guy you used to be.
[02:20:21.729 --> 02:20:23.870]  I'd give anything to feel like you again.
[02:20:24.130 --> 02:20:25.770]  Just try Ageless Male.
[02:20:25.990 --> 02:20:30.691]  It's a natural supplement, proven in a clinical trial to boost testosterone 61%.
[02:20:31.531 --> 02:20:33.051]  And within normal, healthy ranges.
[02:20:33.271 --> 02:20:38.453]  It's not an injection, not a prescription, and with healthy testosterone levels, you can feel the energy again.
[02:20:38.653 --> 02:20:42.193]  Not to mention a better mood and more drive in your romantic life.
[02:20:42.413 --> 02:20:43.574]  More drive, huh?
[02:20:43.854 --> 02:20:45.654]  I really need to try Ageless Male.
[02:20:45.834 --> 02:20:46.675]  Where's my phone?
[02:20:47.035 --> 02:20:47.956]  You're laying on it.
[02:20:48.137 --> 02:20:48.357]  Oops.
[02:20:48.577 --> 02:20:51.260]  Call now for a risk-free trial of Ageless Mail.
[02:20:51.400 --> 02:20:51.961]  Just call 1-800-497-8345.
[02:20:51.981 --> 02:20:52.041]  1-800-497-8345.
[02:20:52.061 --> 02:20:52.121]  1-800-497-8345.
[02:21:00.831 --> 02:21:05.875]  Do you know which 37 crucial food items are going to fly off the shelves when the next disaster hits?
[02:21:06.175 --> 02:21:12.399]  If you don't, you and your family may be without food and waiting in long food lines after a big disaster strikes!
[02:21:12.559 --> 02:21:16.282]  You would be surprised how many people don't have these food items right now!
[02:21:17.403 --> 02:21:26.810]  123SurvivalPlan.com has set up a For Patriots Only video with inside information on the 37 food items that will sell out first when the next disaster strikes.
[02:21:27.050 --> 02:21:29.432]  The video on 123SurvivalPlan.com
[02:21:30.012 --> 02:21:30.632]  We're good to go.
[02:22:00.365 --> 02:22:07.646]  Did you know nuclear radiation is still spewing out of the melted-down reactors in Fukushima, Japan and making its way across the entire U.S.
[02:22:07.706 --> 02:22:10.467]  continent, contaminating the air, water, and food?
[02:22:10.727 --> 02:22:13.487]  Dangerously high levels of radiation are a reality here.
[02:22:13.708 --> 02:22:18.328]  As a result, radiation poisoning is a distinct possibility for anyone living in the U.S.
[02:22:18.488 --> 02:22:20.449]  unless you do something to protect yourself.
[02:22:20.689 --> 02:22:20.889]  How?
[02:22:21.269 --> 02:22:24.232]  With Liquid Zeolite from RestoreYourHealthNow.com.

[02:22:34.121 --> 02:22:37.724]  Liquid Zeolite is so powerful it was used to clean up contamination in Chernobyl.

[02:23:00.200 --> 02:23:02.862]  Do you suffer from low-functioning adrenal or thyroid?
[02:23:03.182 --> 02:23:08.546]  Did you know that mercury from your dental fillings comes off of your teeth both as a vapor and as particles into your body?
[02:23:08.746 --> 02:23:12.228]  Wherever mercury deposits in your body, it stops cells from functioning normally.
[02:23:12.408 --> 02:23:15.250]  Animal studies show that mercury causes kidney function to drop by 60%.
[02:23:16.411 --> 02:23:21.034]  Mercury deposited into your adrenals or thyroid will cause the corresponding drop in function.
[02:23:21.314 --> 02:23:25.757]  The number one method by which your body detoxifies itself of mercury is glutathione.
[02:23:25.957 --> 02:23:33.803]  The number one superfood that helps turn on all 10 trillion cells of your body to produce glutathione is non-denatured whey protein from grass-fed cows.
[02:23:34.143 --> 02:23:46.472]  After investigating most high-end whey proteins on the market, only one is the most non-denatured, the most active, the most complete, and in our opinion, the most powerful in what nature originally put into the fresh raw whey.
[02:23:46.852 --> 02:23:48.013]  It is One World Way.
[02:23:48.293 --> 02:23:50.294]  Call 888-988-3325.

[02:23:56.199 --> 02:23:59.321]  That's OneWorld, W-H-E-Y.com.
[02:24:03.323 --> 02:24:08.127]  Alright, I'm gonna take a bunch of calls now and after the break, and then I will get into the other news I haven't covered, like this.
[02:24:08.767 --> 02:24:12.250]  I had this on Sunday at InfoWars.com, but I didn't cover it on the radio.
[02:24:13.502 --> 02:24:17.283]  Atlanta Jewish Times publisher steps down over Obama hit column.
[02:24:18.103 --> 02:24:19.783]  CBS News reports out of Atlanta.
[02:24:21.764 --> 02:24:33.186]  I'm going to comment on this coming up, but the fact that he would openly talk like that shows just the complete arrogance that if Obama didn't attack Iran, he needs to be dealt with.
[02:24:35.127 --> 02:24:37.047]  And that just shows people buying propaganda.
[02:24:37.147 --> 02:24:39.268]  Obama is attacking Iran inside.
[02:24:39.368 --> 02:24:41.128]  Obama is a New World Order warmonger.
[02:24:42.796 --> 02:24:45.799]  It just shows the complete false reality people live in.
[02:24:45.819 --> 02:24:48.802]  I mean, this guy should be arrested.
[02:24:49.443 --> 02:24:55.249]  I'll guarantee you, if I came on air and said, you know, get the president, use those words, they would come after me.
[02:24:56.170 --> 02:24:57.171]  It's just totally sick.
[02:24:57.211 --> 02:24:58.652]  But again, the president runs nothing.
[02:24:59.593 --> 02:25:01.435]  Mike in Texas, you're on the air, welcome.
[02:25:03.697 --> 02:25:03.857]  Hello?
[02:25:04.198 --> 02:25:04.658]  Hey, buddy.
[02:25:05.439 --> 02:25:06.140]  Hello, how you doing?
[02:25:07.625 --> 02:25:10.526]  Yes, I wanted to tell you, I think the people are missing the point.
[02:25:10.826 --> 02:25:16.108]  You are telling them every day, and what they don't understand is the law is not the law anymore.
[02:25:16.188 --> 02:25:16.868]  It's control.
[02:25:16.888 --> 02:25:20.290]  The law was the law in the past, but now they're using it as a control grid.
[02:25:20.310 --> 02:25:24.951]  Like you said, we understand that our law is law, but it's not.
[02:25:24.991 --> 02:25:26.712]  They're using law as a control thing.
[02:25:26.912 --> 02:25:43.786]  Yes, the government is illegitimate now and a joke and authoritarian and they admit they are and they're arrogant and crazy and dangerous as it gets and are bringing us into collapse and I'm jumping up and down screaming and yelling because it's freaking me out and I'm concerned.
[02:25:43.846 --> 02:25:50.932]  I'm not scared but I'm energetic and jumping up and down trying to get people to be concerned.
[02:25:50.952 --> 02:25:51.533]  It'd be like if
[02:25:52.133 --> 02:25:58.956]  There was a bunch of fires coming and burning down the city and nobody seemed to care and was walking around like zombies while houses are burning down around them.
[02:25:59.276 --> 02:26:00.356]  It's very frustrating.
[02:26:00.376 --> 02:26:01.036]  Go ahead, sorry.
[02:26:01.637 --> 02:26:06.158]  Yeah, and also I want to tell you, also I've been looking at what you were saying about all these vaccines.
[02:26:06.778 --> 02:26:08.279]  Like, my health is not that good.
[02:26:08.359 --> 02:26:12.701]  I can't be taking a vaccine with my kidneys, you know, not working too good.
[02:26:12.801 --> 02:26:15.022]  So I went to Lone Star College here in Houston, Texas.
[02:26:15.542 --> 02:26:17.122]  They're also on the grid.
[02:26:17.142 --> 02:26:21.264]  They're setting up the grid here because they're setting street lights, I mean, cameras.
[02:26:21.804 --> 02:26:47.480]  In neighborhoods and also the colleges won't let you attend unless you take a meningitis vaccine and I think that's not right because meningitis is a very dangerous virus and to be pushing that vaccine with us not knowing what's in it I think that's not... By the way you're right the meningitis vaccine is one of the most dangerous and meningitis is incredibly rare and the vaccine they give you in most cases doesn't even protect you from the type that's coming in and it's not even really
[02:26:48.200 --> 02:26:49.561]  The law that you have to do that.
[02:26:49.601 --> 02:26:50.281]  It's a fraud.
[02:26:50.321 --> 02:26:56.465]  And look, until three years ago, they told people with kidney trouble or who were pregnant or a whole other list not to take vaccines.
[02:26:57.206 --> 02:26:59.767]  Now they tell women if you're pregnant, take it even more.
[02:27:00.288 --> 02:27:02.309]  And then it kills the baby in many cases.
[02:27:02.509 --> 02:27:03.210]  That's what I mean.
[02:27:03.350 --> 02:27:04.911]  It's gotten crazy.
[02:27:05.371 --> 02:27:06.352]  The special interest
[02:27:07.492 --> 02:27:11.654]  No, it's going to kill a bunch of women and deform their babies if it doesn't kill them.
[02:27:12.094 --> 02:27:13.355]  And they say go ahead with it.
[02:27:13.895 --> 02:27:18.016]  And I remember the Houston police chief five years ago called for cameras in people's homes.
[02:27:19.177 --> 02:27:21.378]  I mean, what did you think of that?
[02:27:21.678 --> 02:27:26.560]  Did you hear that AP video where they were saying how great it is to have pre-crime now?
[02:27:27.180 --> 02:27:29.461]  And that you're a criminal beforehand because they say so?
[02:27:30.424 --> 02:27:31.185]  I was looking at that.
[02:27:31.245 --> 02:27:31.885]  I don't like that.
[02:27:32.225 --> 02:27:35.988]  That right there should be a showstopper for people to, like, wake up, you know?
[02:27:36.469 --> 02:27:39.571]  If they're trying to make you a pre-criminal, then that says a president.
[02:27:39.671 --> 02:27:49.999]  Like you said, I think it's just, I think they're trying to set so many presidents to put people in jail because if you get us all in jail on any little charge, they can all of a sudden just switch, you know, hit a switch.
[02:27:50.519 --> 02:27:53.665]  And start sending us to FEMA camps and start annihilating our race.
[02:27:53.705 --> 02:28:01.560]  So we need to stand together and I think all the Christians and people that believe in God need to send a letter to the White House right now, today.
[02:28:02.857 --> 02:28:07.678]  And get all your church groups and church members to go against the evilness in our country right now.
[02:28:07.718 --> 02:28:09.839]  We are being taken over by saints and themselves.
[02:28:10.339 --> 02:28:15.080]  We need to start standing up together and getting everybody... And I'll tell you what it is here.
[02:28:15.100 --> 02:28:15.840]  You're absolutely right.
[02:28:16.160 --> 02:28:18.561]  I've always known this was coming.
[02:28:18.581 --> 02:28:20.562]  The day I went to an urban warfare drill in 1998,
[02:28:22.162 --> 02:28:24.744]  And saw troops trying to take our guns and put us in camps.
[02:28:25.225 --> 02:28:26.266]  And they were admitting that.
[02:28:26.586 --> 02:28:30.289]  That's when I started really turning into the Alex Jones I am today.
[02:28:30.930 --> 02:28:33.993]  Because before that I was just a mainline libertarian like Ron Paul.
[02:28:34.893 --> 02:28:36.395]  And you know, audit the feds, stuff like that.
[02:28:37.296 --> 02:28:39.758]  And so I've known this was coming.
[02:28:40.178 --> 02:28:41.379]  And now we're getting close.
[02:28:41.459 --> 02:28:43.902]  But as it's confirmed,
[02:28:45.333 --> 02:28:48.454]  Mike, as it becomes real, it's freaking me out.
[02:28:48.875 --> 02:28:50.715]  I mean, they're really going to do all this.
[02:28:51.216 --> 02:28:57.338]  They're really going to stage domestic terror attacks and blame it on people and probably try to come arrest me and my family.
[02:28:57.958 --> 02:28:59.539]  And I'm not trying to scare people, folks.
[02:28:59.859 --> 02:29:01.480]  I think people have got to have courage.
[02:29:01.940 --> 02:29:03.381]  I mean, these are bad criminals.
[02:29:03.901 --> 02:29:05.622]  And people are like, well, I'm just going to go along with it.
[02:29:06.062 --> 02:29:07.802]  Look at how the economy is shutting down.
[02:29:08.283 --> 02:29:13.245]  They're bringing tyranny in because they know people are going to get mad when everybody becomes incredibly poor.
[02:29:14.145 --> 02:29:15.846]  And I mean to the point of starving to death.
[02:29:15.866 --> 02:29:18.726]  You know, they talk about shutting America down.
[02:29:19.466 --> 02:29:22.287]  Look at how they shut down that pipeline, they're going to send the oil to China.
[02:29:22.807 --> 02:29:25.008]  Look at how they pay companies to leave the United States.
[02:29:25.088 --> 02:29:27.509]  I mean, the globalists hate America.
[02:29:27.769 --> 02:29:29.969]  They've got really bad stuff in store for us.
[02:29:30.289 --> 02:29:33.010]  They're training the military to secretly arrest and torture.
[02:29:33.550 --> 02:29:36.851]  I mean, they're trying to turn the military into demons.
[02:29:38.292 --> 02:29:41.192]  And because that's not successful, they're training foreign troops now.
[02:29:41.653 --> 02:29:42.913]  God bless you, good to hear from you.
[02:29:44.008 --> 02:29:46.171]  Cancer beater Joseph Patrick Dugg.
[02:29:46.191 --> 02:29:47.853]  Your calls are coming up with a ton of news.
[02:29:47.873 --> 02:29:48.374]  Stay with us.
[02:29:49.976 --> 02:29:50.877]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.378 --> 02:29:52.960]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.901 --> 02:29:56.565]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.072 --> 02:30:06.473]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:30:07.733 --> 02:30:12.494]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:30:12.874 --> 02:30:19.635]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:30:21.596 --> 02:30:24.396]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:30:25.657 --> 02:30:27.617]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:30:30.083 --> 02:30:33.966]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:30:34.686 --> 02:30:37.809]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[02:30:38.529 --> 02:30:39.310]  Others don't.
[02:30:39.750 --> 02:30:41.631]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:30:41.891 --> 02:30:43.393]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[02:30:43.673 --> 02:30:46.235]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:30:46.575 --> 02:30:52.819]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:30:53.199 --> 02:30:55.421]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:30:55.901 --> 02:30:57.923]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[02:30:58.263 --> 02:30:59.144]  Others don't.
[02:31:00.233 --> 02:31:04.456]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:04.777 --> 02:31:05.057]  Number 1.
[02:31:05.697 --> 02:31:08.840]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.120 --> 02:31:09.680]  Number 2.
[02:31:09.981 --> 02:31:14.524]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:14.864 --> 02:31:15.325]  It's true.
[02:31:15.625 --> 02:31:20.188]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:20.489 --> 02:31:21.029]  Number 3.
[02:31:21.309 --> 02:31:24.592]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:24.892 --> 02:31:28.595]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:28.795 --> 02:31:29.356]  Number 4.
[02:31:29.596 --> 02:31:31.958]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.358 --> 02:31:35.741]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.041 --> 02:31:36.242]  Number 5.
[02:31:36.822 --> 02:31:40.745]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:40.986 --> 02:31:45.730]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:46.010 --> 02:31:50.054]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:50.194 --> 02:31:51.756]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:51.976 --> 02:31:54.038]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:31:54.238 --> 02:31:56.581]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:32:01.158 --> 02:32:02.660]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:32:02.880 --> 02:32:07.905]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:32:08.185 --> 02:32:09.546]  Saving means to make money.
[02:32:09.727 --> 02:32:18.515]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:32:19.236 --> 02:32:26.341]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:32:26.781 --> 02:32:34.386]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:32:34.766 --> 02:32:39.689]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[02:32:40.009 --> 02:32:42.170]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:32:44.892 --> 02:32:47.853]  Call 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at five star soap .com.
[02:32:48.153 --> 02:32:52.655]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at five star soap .com.
[02:33:29.462 --> 02:33:34.808]  We're going to be going back to your phone calls here in just a moment, and then I've got to get to the rest of the news.
[02:33:34.868 --> 02:33:36.109]  I did cover quite a bit of it earlier.
[02:33:36.129 --> 02:33:42.475]  I want to recap a few of the top stories but get to the other stacks here, at least briefly, each piece of news.
[02:33:43.376 --> 02:33:47.340]  Separately, if you're a radio listener, you probably don't really see what I look like.
[02:33:48.464 --> 02:33:57.986]  But if you go to InfoWars.com, there is a button up at the top that says, you know, watch the show live now, and you can watch 20 minutes of it for free.
[02:33:58.026 --> 02:34:00.307]  We can't afford to have the whole show live and free.
[02:34:00.927 --> 02:34:05.808]  It's costing us like $12,000 more a month just to have a little 20-minute thing free once a day.
[02:34:06.328 --> 02:34:15.911]  We're going to try to, we're working on some cheaper bandwidth to have it always, you know, the daytime show free up there, the video, and then a higher resolution one at,
[02:34:17.671 --> 02:34:21.515]  PrisonPlanet.tv for members and the nighttime show for subscribers, The Nightly News.
[02:34:21.535 --> 02:34:28.040]  And there's always a link under it for the free audio stream and the podcast as well.
[02:34:29.081 --> 02:34:36.808]  But the point I'm making here is that if you can look at me, you can see that I have lost a lot of weight.
[02:34:37.809 --> 02:34:41.172]  I have now lost, depending on which scale I use, 37 pounds.
[02:34:44.857 --> 02:34:48.119]  37 pounds, and we're going to do some before and after photos soon.
[02:34:48.139 --> 02:34:58.766]  I've just been too busy to show it, you know, to actually put a commercial together showing it, but I'm going to lose another 23, 25 pounds or so.
[02:34:59.887 --> 02:35:03.549]  I'm going down from 260 down to about 180.
[02:35:10.521 --> 02:35:12.802]  And quite frankly, I'm just jogging.
[02:35:13.463 --> 02:35:15.564]  I've done that before and it didn't work because I was always hungry.
[02:35:16.184 --> 02:35:37.436]  But because I did research the last year, only put this into effect the last two months, I found that it's mineral and vitamin and trace element deficiency in the food, in the depleted soils that the animals are eating crops from and that we're eating crops from.
[02:35:39.039 --> 02:35:49.631]  And more importantly, the sodium fluoride and the other things that they put, the hundreds of chemicals they put in the drinking water, those, even though I try to avoid it, I still get it at restaurants and places.
[02:35:50.905 --> 02:35:52.626]  And it also gets into the food chain itself.
[02:35:53.186 --> 02:35:58.008]  Those fill up your organs and your thyroid and your glands full of bad stuff.
[02:35:58.309 --> 02:36:02.070]  The globalists have chosen all the things they put in the water to poison your glands.
[02:36:02.150 --> 02:36:06.152]  I mean, they know seven-fold increase in bone cancer, IQ reduction.
[02:36:06.433 --> 02:36:08.754]  They know hyperthyroidism, epidemic.
[02:36:10.014 --> 02:36:12.535]  I mean, there's a reason we lead the world in all these diseases.
[02:36:12.555 --> 02:36:14.616]  I mean, the globalists hate our guts.
[02:36:15.297 --> 02:36:16.557]  They don't just hate Iraqis.
[02:36:16.617 --> 02:36:17.558]  They hate us even more.
[02:36:18.888 --> 02:36:20.068]  But they know how to soft kill us.
[02:36:20.088 --> 02:36:23.389]  They're just getting ready to use the military on us now and wrap the American flag in it.
[02:36:23.409 --> 02:36:30.771]  A lot of good old boys, folks, would beat a baby's brains out if you said America, you know, wrapped the killing in the flag.
[02:36:31.811 --> 02:36:32.771]  It's just a mindlessness.
[02:36:33.131 --> 02:36:35.392]  Or if you said NFL, they'd just slit their kids' throats.
[02:36:35.472 --> 02:36:36.592]  Alright, NFL!
[02:36:37.072 --> 02:36:37.932]  I'm tough, I'm a man!
[02:36:37.952 --> 02:36:39.693]  I mean, it's just like, that's all that matters.
[02:36:39.713 --> 02:36:40.433]  American flag, NFL.
[02:36:41.912 --> 02:36:50.977]  You could, if Satan came out wearing a cloak of the American flag, they would throw Jesus overboard off a ship and just bow down and just start worshipping.
[02:36:51.597 --> 02:36:54.498]  I mean, if they said, go to, are you ready to die and go to Hades?
[02:36:54.538 --> 02:36:56.580]  They would say yes, as long as there's American flags.
[02:36:56.920 --> 02:36:59.621]  As long as the flames look like American flags burning me.
[02:37:01.382 --> 02:37:05.124]  Like Meryl Monroe when she's standing out there on top of that grate with that wind blowing up, you know.
[02:37:05.464 --> 02:37:08.886]  As long as it's like American flag flames shooting up, they're ready.
[02:37:10.455 --> 02:37:15.498]  I mean, you could burn the Bill of Rights Constitution in a pit, and they'd bow down to it, as long as the American flag said so.
[02:37:17.039 --> 02:37:19.701]  You see, they don't know what patriotism, liberty, and freedom is.
[02:37:19.741 --> 02:37:23.863]  They just get off on feeling like they're part of the power structure.
[02:37:24.503 --> 02:37:27.645]  They watch drones fly over, and they think, those are my drones.
[02:37:29.166 --> 02:37:33.609]  They sit around and watch shock and awe as buildings blow up full of families in them, and they feel manly.
[02:37:33.989 --> 02:37:36.571]  I've actually seen it with family and people.
[02:37:36.591 --> 02:37:39.212]  They're just like, oh, look at that killer.
[02:37:40.660 --> 02:37:47.513]  You know, they'll watch the military channel ten years after stuff happens, just watch it, just, oh, oh, get them, oh yeah, oh yeah.
[02:37:47.653 --> 02:37:48.074]  Well, you know what?
[02:37:48.094 --> 02:37:50.058]  The New World Order's getting you, too.
[02:37:50.839 --> 02:37:51.300]  I mean, I mean...
[02:37:52.645 --> 02:37:57.006]  Jay Rockefeller, whenever they passed the NDAA, he was just like, fist up in the air.
[02:37:57.186 --> 02:37:57.906]  Yeah!
[02:37:58.346 --> 02:37:59.547]  Score against freedom!
[02:38:00.247 --> 02:38:05.288]  Because the globalists, even though you serve them happily, they've never forgotten your ancestors fought them.
[02:38:05.968 --> 02:38:08.469]  And the globalists are all about ancestors and bloodlines.
[02:38:08.709 --> 02:38:11.930]  So they're going to rout America out and kill that birthright.
[02:38:12.310 --> 02:38:16.030]  Doesn't matter how much of a servant of evil you are, you're to be destroyed!
[02:38:16.391 --> 02:38:18.031]  Because your ancestors opposed them.
[02:38:20.219 --> 02:38:25.784]  It doesn't matter, you're going to be there like a little dog, looking up at the barrel of a gun, just going, please, master, shoot me.
[02:38:25.804 --> 02:38:31.248]  It's kind of like that clip in Time Bandits, whenever the devil's sitting there frying and blowing up his own minions.
[02:38:31.548 --> 02:38:33.310]  He's like, I'm going to destroy you.
[02:38:34.010 --> 02:38:35.632]  Oh, thank you, master.
[02:38:36.092 --> 02:38:36.752]  Thank you.
[02:38:39.054 --> 02:38:39.655]  They love it.
[02:38:39.875 --> 02:38:43.018]  They try to pull up Time Bandits, the devil from Time Bandits.
[02:38:44.686 --> 02:38:48.130]  Bad guy, villain from Time Bandits, killing his minions.
[02:38:48.631 --> 02:38:49.472]  Show a short clip of that.
[02:38:49.552 --> 02:38:49.933]  Alright, alright.
[02:38:50.633 --> 02:38:58.083]  See, the reason I hardly plug videos, products, and things, even though it funds our operation, and it's stuff I believe in, and great products, is because I'm always too busy ranting.
[02:38:58.543 --> 02:38:59.825]  There's no teleprompters here, folks.
[02:38:59.845 --> 02:39:00.666]  You get what you get.
[02:39:01.347 --> 02:39:02.649]  I'm going to your calls here in just a second.
[02:39:03.447 --> 02:39:11.553]  The point is, go to InfoWarsTeam.com to find the Tangy Tangerine Mineral Vitamin Total Replacement.
[02:39:11.593 --> 02:39:12.573]  I mean, it's got everything.
[02:39:13.634 --> 02:39:16.576]  The Rebound is off the charts awesome, and so is the Polymburst.
[02:39:16.836 --> 02:39:19.478]  I am choosing a Polymburst right now.
[02:39:22.280 --> 02:39:25.082]  You know, coffee, a little bit of it's good for you, but a lot of it's very bad for you.
[02:39:25.102 --> 02:39:26.063]  The oils and things in it.
[02:39:27.725 --> 02:39:28.205]  No more.
[02:39:29.606 --> 02:39:37.290]  You take a pollen burst or a rebound with things like ginseng and the rebound or a little bit of caffeine and all the B vitamins and the pollen burst.
[02:39:37.950 --> 02:39:42.092]  And I tell you, it's not like drinking that afternoon coffee that kind of wakes you up and gives you a headache.
[02:39:42.752 --> 02:39:44.773]  I'm just woken up without the headache part.
[02:39:45.354 --> 02:39:51.296]  And I've lost 35 to 37 pounds depending on which scale I look at.
[02:39:51.917 --> 02:39:54.378]  And the problem is I've got to make myself eat now.
[02:39:55.342 --> 02:40:01.664]  I've got to make my... I mean, the Tangy Tangerine doesn't even have ginseng or caffeine in it, and that's my breakfast, is a scoop of that in the morning.
[02:40:02.084 --> 02:40:04.765]  I mean, I'm... because my body didn't have the minerals and vitamins.
[02:40:05.265 --> 02:40:12.468]  So anyways, InfoWarsTeam.com, InfoWarsTeam.com, or banners at InfoWars.com that lead over there for the Tangy Tangerine.

[02:40:55.990 --> 02:40:57.370]  We're certainly having a big effect.
[02:40:58.230 --> 02:41:00.851]  CancerBeater from California.
[02:41:00.871 --> 02:41:02.152]  Gee, I wonder what your call's about.
[02:41:02.212 --> 02:41:02.532]  Welcome.
[02:41:04.778 --> 02:41:05.819]  Hi Alex, how are you doing today?
[02:41:06.159 --> 02:41:08.460]  Oh, I'm ranting like a madman, mad for liberty.
[02:41:08.560 --> 02:41:08.940]  Go ahead.
[02:41:08.960 --> 02:41:11.642]  Oh, I'm loving your ranting, Alex.
[02:41:11.682 --> 02:41:13.623]  You are always awesome on the ranting.
[02:41:13.643 --> 02:41:28.992]  I had stage 4 colon cancer about a year and a half ago, and the doctors told me I only had 6 months to a year left to live without their treatment, maybe 2 to 3 years to live with their treatment, which meant they were never going to be able to cure me.
[02:41:30.422 --> 02:41:51.919]  And some friends of mine on Facebook told me to watch this documentary called The Beautiful Truth and I bought the Gerson Therapy book and a juicer from Costco and also did Run From The Cure from Rick Simpson which is basically hash oil and I was able to cure myself in four months.
[02:41:53.680 --> 02:41:56.981]  Well, they're doing everything they can to keep you from getting that hash oil, I know.
[02:41:57.542 --> 02:42:08.507]  And yes, a lot of cancers, it's been proven with just the diet, cutting out the things that grow cancer, the alkalinity of the water, the system knows that.
[02:42:08.527 --> 02:42:13.349]  And now they admit that actually, in most cases, chemotherapy kills you.
[02:42:13.989 --> 02:42:17.971]  It's just if your body can beat both, well then, you know, that's basically what happens.
[02:42:18.791 --> 02:42:19.712]  And colon cancer,
[02:42:20.592 --> 02:42:23.274]  And other cancers of the gut is like getting the flu now.
[02:42:24.195 --> 02:42:37.205]  In the last two years, three people in my office, their girlfriends or family members, young people, have gotten colon cancer, and then start the radiation and all the rest of it, and of course it never really helps them.
[02:42:37.845 --> 02:42:39.687]  And yeah, it's just cancer everywhere.
[02:42:40.127 --> 02:42:43.770]  Fifty years ago, scientists would travel the world over to see a child with cancer.
[02:42:44.090 --> 02:42:46.352]  Now, I go to the mall, it's just kids with cancer everywhere.
[02:42:46.912 --> 02:42:49.234]  Because, I mean, the New World Order is hitting us hard.
[02:42:49.935 --> 02:42:51.316]  And loving it all the way to the bank.
[02:42:51.356 --> 02:42:52.137]  You pay for it.
[02:42:52.657 --> 02:42:54.819]  You pay to murder your children with all of it.
[02:42:54.839 --> 02:42:59.103]  And now, if you try to get away from their chemotherapy with your kids, they just come and take them and murder them.
[02:42:59.863 --> 02:43:01.665]  And it's just all part of the murder enjoyment.
[02:43:02.808 --> 02:43:05.710]  And again, they've just tested the soft killing of us.
[02:43:06.210 --> 02:43:09.112]  And so now it's just going to get more and more wild, more and more crazy.
[02:43:10.392 --> 02:43:13.594]  Never ask, why do we have the highest breast cancer in the world and it's exploding?
[02:43:14.154 --> 02:43:18.117]  Never find out it's bisphenol A in the GMO from the same rat studies.
[02:43:18.577 --> 02:43:21.538]  Just talk about figuring out how to cure it once you get it.
[02:43:22.039 --> 02:43:23.660]  Don't ask why everybody's getting it.
[02:43:24.500 --> 02:43:29.641]  Because the little murderers, the same ones that are making the money off the treatments, are the ones that gave it to you.
[02:43:29.901 --> 02:43:37.163]  They're sickening eugenicist murderers who promise to put stuff in your water, like the White House science czar said, and they think it's real cute.
[02:43:37.823 --> 02:43:42.745]  And they think it's real funny that they're killing everybody out in the open and nobody wants to stand up against them.
[02:43:47.286 --> 02:43:48.266]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[02:43:49.748 --> 02:44:05.436]  Yeah, I also bought an atmospheric water generator so I can get myself off of the regular water supply and basically you just plug it in the wall, it sucks water into it and produces high alkaline, high pH water to also battle cancer.
[02:44:05.476 --> 02:44:06.136]  Cancer beater?
[02:44:06.816 --> 02:44:10.058]  Why don't you just trust the government and drink the tap water?
[02:44:10.985 --> 02:44:12.386]  We do have the highest rates of cancer.
[02:44:12.406 --> 02:44:13.746]  They care!
[02:44:14.147 --> 02:44:15.387]  Are you an extremist?
[02:44:15.848 --> 02:44:25.853]  Because the other White House and Soros people, I have the article, are calling for shutting down the websites of conspiracy theorists, people that don't trust known certified liars.
[02:44:26.613 --> 02:44:30.155]  They're saying if you don't believe known certified liars, you should be arrested.
[02:44:30.475 --> 02:44:31.596]  What's wrong with that?
[02:44:33.677 --> 02:44:35.718]  Well, I don't trust them as far as you can throw them.
[02:44:36.837 --> 02:44:38.698]  Well, I mean, you know, that's because you're extreme.
[02:44:38.718 --> 02:44:40.099]  I mean, you're actually thinking for yourself.
[02:44:41.780 --> 02:44:51.025]  But being serious, so what's happened to the out-of-control cell growth, similar to our government, since you started the juicing and things?
[02:44:52.586 --> 02:44:54.306]  Well, it completely reversed.
[02:44:54.467 --> 02:45:02.471]  I went from a two-inch gulf wall-sized tumor and two lymph nodes on each side of my abdominal area and a bunch of activity going on in my lungs.
[02:45:03.342 --> 02:45:06.865]  To absolutely clean and clear of cancer now in four months.
[02:45:08.446 --> 02:45:09.847]  And what are the doctors saying?
[02:45:09.887 --> 02:45:11.469]  Are they trying to have you arrested or something?
[02:45:11.529 --> 02:45:12.269]  Forced on treatment?
[02:45:13.630 --> 02:45:23.599]  Absolutely not, but neither one of the oncologists wanted to know what I did to cure my cancer, which in my opinion just goes to prove that an oncologist is nothing more than a drug dealing poison pusher.
[02:45:24.332 --> 02:45:32.215]  Well, yeah, they get hundreds of thousands of dollars for somebody they treat, and you're talking about, you know, $3,000, $4,000 per can of Raid.
[02:45:32.755 --> 02:45:37.316]  Most of the chemo is basically just rat poison or roach poison.
[02:45:38.116 --> 02:45:40.877]  I mean, you know, that's why they've come out now with a, you know, $3,000 a bottle
[02:45:43.263 --> 02:45:47.146]  There's a hemp variant that is used to treat a bunch of illnesses.
[02:45:47.166 --> 02:45:48.427]  That was in the news yesterday.
[02:45:48.447 --> 02:45:53.372]  In fact, guys put, it was like AP company comes out with synthetic marijuana.
[02:45:54.032 --> 02:46:02.719]  And, you know, they've got a $250 bottle of fish oil that should cost $10 that's synthetic and, you know, that they make money off of.
[02:46:02.980 --> 02:46:07.624]  And so, of course, they're trying to make it illegal for you to get fish oil for $10.
[02:46:07.684 --> 02:46:10.006]  So you have to buy it from them and go to a doctor.
[02:46:10.646 --> 02:46:16.588]  And I've seen articles where they SWAT team people now growing aloe vera, saying it could be used as a drug.
[02:46:16.908 --> 02:46:19.469]  Look, you're not gonna get aloe vera, you're not gonna get fish.
[02:46:20.029 --> 02:46:21.030]  That's terrorism!
[02:46:21.050 --> 02:46:24.711]  I mean, you know, you gotta use heroin shipped in by the U.S.
[02:46:24.791 --> 02:46:25.071]  Army.
[02:46:25.411 --> 02:46:26.532]  I appreciate your call, terrorist.
[02:46:29.053 --> 02:46:31.113]  Joseph in Colorado, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:46:31.133 --> 02:46:33.734]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[02:46:34.255 --> 02:46:35.275]  I'm pretty evil right now.
[02:46:36.715 --> 02:46:37.956]  Yeah, I can tell, man.
[02:46:37.976 --> 02:46:40.538]  I have a question and I've got a comment.
[02:46:41.899 --> 02:46:43.560]  Well, I guess my comment's pretty big.
[02:46:43.580 --> 02:46:53.366]  I wanted to say that, I mean, all this stuff that you're saying about the doctors with, you know, Big Pharma supposedly taking care of everybody, it's heavy down here.
[02:46:53.867 --> 02:46:59.290]  I mean, flu shots for free in some cases down at Walmart or at Walgreens.
[02:46:59.310 --> 02:47:01.392]  Yeah, that's because they care about you.
[02:47:01.412 --> 02:47:04.234]  Joseph, Joseph, they care about you.
[02:47:07.189 --> 02:47:13.691]  They care about us so much that they got my mom and dad, you know, they got their drawers filled with drugs.
[02:47:14.451 --> 02:47:21.273]  They've taken my sister's gallbladder out because it's got stones because she's sick from everything she's eating.
[02:47:21.293 --> 02:47:29.916]  And I've got aunts who are paralyzed from diseases that have sprung out of nowhere and it's all because my family's ecstatic.
[02:47:31.568 --> 02:47:38.617]  I mean, I almost caught cancer in my colon and I thankfully had it removed.
[02:47:38.717 --> 02:47:41.661]  It was a cancerous polyp they found inside me.
[02:47:41.701 --> 02:47:43.003]  Yeah, well let me expand on that.
[02:47:43.063 --> 02:47:44.084]  I should do a report on that.
[02:47:44.545 --> 02:47:46.407]  Blacks and Hispanics especially.
[02:47:47.528 --> 02:47:48.949]  Uh, are all being targeted.
[02:47:49.169 --> 02:47:53.331]  And I mean, the diabetes, the cancer rates, all of it is off the charts.
[02:47:53.712 --> 02:47:59.715]  And they've done studies I've seen where the behavior isn't different, but they're getting more HIV, more hepatitis.
[02:48:00.115 --> 02:48:06.378]  And yes, the globalists, there's no doubt, are targeting people worldwide according to their race.
[02:48:06.618 --> 02:48:07.439]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:48:08.874 --> 02:48:09.755]  It's no joke.
[02:48:09.795 --> 02:48:10.876]  I mean, you said it.
[02:48:10.916 --> 02:48:12.198]  My parents have diabetes.
[02:48:12.498 --> 02:48:14.881]  They've got, you know, other complications due to it.
[02:48:14.921 --> 02:48:16.083]  They're both obese.
[02:48:16.323 --> 02:48:20.448]  I mean, and that's just my parents, and it's running through my family.
[02:48:21.109 --> 02:48:26.316]  And they've got all sorts of, like, it's either they're addicted to smoking cigarettes, or it's addicted to drinking.
[02:48:27.048 --> 02:48:28.449]  And by the way, what do they do with cigarettes?
[02:48:28.469 --> 02:48:31.812]  They put chemicals in them to make them more addicting and make you smoke more.
[02:48:32.092 --> 02:48:33.653]  They're doing it with the GMO.
[02:48:33.994 --> 02:48:35.475]  They're doing it with all the additives.
[02:48:35.935 --> 02:48:36.596]  They're doing it.
[02:48:36.636 --> 02:48:37.656]  They're killing us.
[02:48:37.777 --> 02:48:41.920]  People ate even more calories than they do now, 50 years ago on average.
[02:48:42.260 --> 02:48:44.102]  It's that the stuff we're eating is killing us.
[02:48:44.162 --> 02:48:45.122]  I appreciate your call.
[02:48:45.503 --> 02:48:46.143]  God bless you.
[02:48:46.183 --> 02:48:47.644]  Sorry to hear that's happened to your family.
[02:48:48.205 --> 02:48:50.747]  Get them on the tangy tangerine.
[02:48:52.011 --> 02:48:53.031]  Get them off the cigarettes.
[02:48:53.071 --> 02:48:55.272]  Get them to commit to not kill themselves.
[02:48:55.332 --> 02:48:56.432]  Get them off the GMO.
[02:48:56.452 --> 02:48:57.652]  Get them off the trans fats.
[02:48:58.833 --> 02:49:00.953]  What's killing us is stuff that isn't natural.
[02:49:01.073 --> 02:49:03.174]  I know that's extreme and I'm bad, but it's true.
[02:49:03.514 --> 02:49:06.054]  Here's a clip from Time Bandits I was mentioning earlier.
[02:49:08.055 --> 02:49:08.375]  Robert.
[02:49:09.475 --> 02:49:09.795]  Yes, Master.
[02:49:11.375 --> 02:49:12.136]  Your time has come.
[02:49:13.236 --> 02:49:14.156]  Oh, wonderful, Master.
[02:49:14.356 --> 02:49:15.136]  Wonderful.
[02:49:15.216 --> 02:49:16.957]  Wonderful.
[02:49:17.417 --> 02:49:18.017]  Don't mention it.
[02:49:30.387 --> 02:49:30.727]  Benson?
[02:49:38.070 --> 02:49:39.050]  I'm a reasonable man.
[02:49:40.911 --> 02:49:44.712]  Give me the map, and you might at least walk out of here on human feet.
[02:49:59.830 --> 02:49:59.930]  No!
[02:49:59.990 --> 02:50:00.130]  No!
[02:50:00.150 --> 02:50:21.114]  Alright, there's from time managers, the head of Homeland Security, who has decided to put everybody through the naked body scanner.
[02:50:22.276 --> 02:50:22.996]  I mean, think about it.
[02:50:23.196 --> 02:50:30.998]  They have TV shows in the U.S., every major, you know, anti-terror show, where they torture somebody's kid to get the answers, and it's always the right thing to do it.
[02:50:31.298 --> 02:50:34.179]  And in the real world, in Abu Ghraib, they're torturing kids sexually.
[02:50:34.499 --> 02:50:37.860]  It comes out, and no one gets in trouble who gave the orders.
[02:50:39.001 --> 02:50:41.561]  I mean, again, that's practicing evil openly.
[02:50:43.182 --> 02:50:44.722]  I want to go to Patrick and Doug, at least.
[02:50:44.742 --> 02:50:45.522]  They've been holding the longest.
[02:50:45.562 --> 02:50:47.423]  I guess I'll do a little bit of overdrive to get to everybody, but...
[02:50:49.076 --> 02:50:50.737]  I gotta get into all this Iran news.
[02:50:50.757 --> 02:50:52.298]  I haven't even gotten into the Tepco news.
[02:50:52.798 --> 02:50:54.379]  I haven't gotten into the Davos news.
[02:50:55.039 --> 02:50:58.401]  I haven't gotten into quite a bit of it, but I did cover a lot today.
[02:50:58.421 --> 02:50:59.001]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:01.385 --> 02:51:03.067]  Ready to save while getting prepared?

[02:53:50.140 --> 02:53:51.561]  Here's a little more from Time Bandits.
[02:54:07.005 --> 02:54:08.266]  All I want to do is see him again.
[02:54:08.346 --> 02:54:08.666]  Come on.
[02:54:09.006 --> 02:54:10.347]  But I can't leave it with him!
[02:54:10.648 --> 02:54:11.969]  Or he'll destroy the world!
[02:54:15.751 --> 02:54:16.352]  Oh, Robert!
[02:54:17.493 --> 02:54:18.013]  Benson!
[02:54:19.394 --> 02:54:25.259]  I feel the power of evil coursing through my veins, spinning every corner of my being with the desire to do wrong.
[02:54:26.620 --> 02:54:28.161]  I feel so bad, Benson!
[02:54:28.321 --> 02:54:28.781]  Good!
[02:54:29.001 --> 02:54:29.842]  Good!
[02:54:30.442 --> 02:54:31.183]  Yes, it is good.
[02:54:32.329 --> 02:54:34.671]  Well, this is the worst kind of badness that I'm feeling.
[02:54:34.811 --> 02:54:35.531]  Kill me, monster!
[02:54:35.631 --> 02:54:36.012]  Kill me!
[02:54:36.052 --> 02:54:36.712]  Not now, Benson.
[02:54:36.752 --> 02:54:37.493]  We have work to do.
[02:54:38.573 --> 02:54:41.836]  No lesser work than the overthrowing of creation itself.
[02:54:42.456 --> 02:54:45.658]  We will remake man in our image, not his.
[02:54:48.140 --> 02:54:54.064]  We will turn mountains into sea, and the skies into rivers, and fjords into deserts.
[02:55:00.489 --> 02:55:01.369]  All right, that's enough.
[02:55:02.050 --> 02:55:03.110]  What an excellent movie.
[02:55:03.230 --> 02:55:04.571]  And that's what the globalists are doing.
[02:55:04.611 --> 02:55:10.813]  The devil wants to genetically engineer, screw everything up, murder people, engage in diseased activity.
[02:55:11.393 --> 02:55:14.334]  And that's what psychopaths and control freaks actually want.
[02:55:15.335 --> 02:55:16.635]  That's what people don't get.
[02:55:16.675 --> 02:55:18.456]  They're like, why does the new world order want this?
[02:55:20.156 --> 02:55:23.237]  Well, why does a rattlesnake want to bite you?
[02:55:24.198 --> 02:55:25.818]  It's the old story of the scorpion.
[02:55:25.838 --> 02:55:27.579]  He asked the frog to take him across the river.
[02:55:28.039 --> 02:55:29.780]  The frog says, you'll sting me.
[02:55:32.054 --> 02:55:33.755]  And, uh, he says, no, I won't, I promise.
[02:55:33.775 --> 02:55:34.435]  Just take me across.
[02:55:34.455 --> 02:55:35.875]  So the frog's nice, he takes him across.
[02:55:35.915 --> 02:55:39.436]  And when they get to the other side, uh, the scorpion stings him and he's laying there dying.
[02:55:39.476 --> 02:55:41.097]  He says, but I took you across.
[02:55:41.157 --> 02:55:41.877]  Why'd you sting me?
[02:55:41.917 --> 02:55:44.478]  And he said, because I'm a scorpion, silly.
[02:55:45.478 --> 02:55:47.419]  The Africans have, every culture has got it.
[02:55:47.439 --> 02:55:53.360]  They've got one, one with the Cobra, uh, where the Cobra is hurt and asked the old man to carry him out of the desert.
[02:55:53.420 --> 02:55:58.382]  And when he gets the Cobra out of the desert and just some water and everything, the Cobra bites him and kills him.
[02:55:58.422 --> 02:56:00.543]  And as the old man's dying, he says, why'd you bite me?
[02:56:00.583 --> 02:56:01.523]  And he goes, I'm a Cobra.
[02:56:03.444 --> 02:56:12.287]  I mean, the Founding Fathers explained from history, if you let this happen, you will be enslaved, and the level of enslavement you live under is the exact level you put up with.
[02:56:12.367 --> 02:56:16.248]  Thomas Jefferson said that.
[02:56:16.388 --> 02:56:17.509]  Quote, I just gave you.
[02:56:20.549 --> 02:56:25.991]  And they said, in the letters back and forth between him and John Adams, he said, why?
[02:56:26.011 --> 02:56:28.332]  And he said, because it's a tropism.
[02:56:30.233 --> 02:56:31.153]  That's what it does.
[02:56:34.059 --> 02:56:34.979]  That's its nature.
[02:56:36.080 --> 02:56:46.725]  The worst of the worst will get in control, and then they'll only be taught by people worse, and then taught by people worse, so you always then sink to the bottom.
[02:56:47.165 --> 02:56:49.226]  And I don't know how much I can explain this to people.
[02:56:49.767 --> 02:57:00.332]  It is an absolute certainty that when I went, this was already going on, but for me, when I went and saw the military training to go door-to-door in the U.S.
[02:57:00.392 --> 02:57:01.993]  and take our guns, it's all in Police State 2000,
[02:57:04.977 --> 02:57:10.179]  When I went and saw that, and then said, well, I better check our other drills.
[02:57:10.359 --> 02:57:11.879]  Hopefully it's not happening in other drills.
[02:57:12.300 --> 02:57:19.002]  And I went to all these other drills and confirmed and saw them working with Boy Scouts to spy on their parents in the drills.
[02:57:21.244 --> 02:57:26.546]  I came back and started freaking out, and even though I had video of the Boy Scouts, people thought it was fake.
[02:57:27.026 --> 02:57:32.827]  Now today, I can show you the New York Times going, look at our Explorer Scouts, training to kill disgruntled veterans.
[02:57:33.267 --> 02:57:35.588]  And they say it with a straight face.
[02:57:36.068 --> 02:57:41.930]  Can somebody say, danger, danger, danger, Will Robinson?
[02:57:45.137 --> 02:57:56.495]  I mean 100% the people running the government, it's a lot bigger than Bill Clinton, Obama, Bush, the special interest running things have a horrible destiny for this country.
[02:57:56.835 --> 02:57:59.900]  They're taking us in a bad place and we're all kind of
[02:58:00.100 --> 02:58:04.063]  Tied up in the car with a serial killer, and I'm trying to, you know, get out of the bonds.
[02:58:04.183 --> 02:58:06.145]  I'm saying, hey, you're not tied down as hard.
[02:58:06.205 --> 02:58:07.026]  Kind of help me get out there.
[02:58:07.046 --> 02:58:09.228]  Like, he'll hurt us if we, if we resist.
[02:58:09.248 --> 02:58:13.651]  I'm like, listen, he's taken us to some shack someplace to torture the daylights out of us.
[02:58:13.952 --> 02:58:15.353]  Our only chance is to get out of here.
[02:58:16.934 --> 02:58:17.715]  You see, that's the thing.
[02:58:17.975 --> 02:58:22.319]  You're not going to get out of this kissing up to this thing.
[02:58:24.966 --> 02:58:27.948]  I know a lot of you are scared out there, and you think, well, what can you do?
[02:58:28.008 --> 02:58:28.768]  You can do a lot.
[02:58:29.249 --> 02:58:32.871]  I mean, you know, get aggressive, ladies and gentlemen, in the InfoWar.
[02:58:33.691 --> 02:58:38.394]  What if our millions of listeners all did an InfoWars.com banner hang today?
[02:58:38.414 --> 02:58:43.917]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:51.972 --> 02:58:55.615]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:58:55.996 --> 02:58:58.998]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:58:59.239 --> 02:59:04.003]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:59:04.023 --> 02:59:10.268]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:59:10.429 --> 02:59:12.671]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:59:13.191 --> 02:59:14.632]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:59:14.692 --> 02:59:15.913]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:59:15.933 --> 02:59:18.214]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:59:32.102 --> 02:59:39.005]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:59:55.102 --> 02:59:58.407]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:59:58.427 --> 03:00:02.814]  And the world will be different, because I have understanding.
[03:00:03.649 --> 03:00:05.751]  Uh, understanding of what, master?
[03:00:06.171 --> 03:00:06.992]  Digital watches.
[03:00:07.772 --> 03:00:11.255]  And soon I shall have understanding of videocassette recorders and car telephones.
[03:00:11.795 --> 03:00:14.777]  And when I have understanding of them, I shall have understanding of computers.
[03:00:15.198 --> 03:00:19.261]  And when I have understanding of computers, I shall be the supreme being.
[03:00:20.221 --> 03:00:22.063]  God isn't interested in technology.
[03:00:23.103 --> 03:00:26.326]  He knows nothing of the potential of the microchip or the silicon revolution.
[03:00:26.966 --> 03:00:28.107]  Look how he spends his time.
[03:00:28.127 --> 03:00:30.069]  43 speeches of parrots.
[03:00:31.218 --> 03:00:32.319]  Nipples for men.
[03:00:33.159 --> 03:00:33.559]  Slugs.
[03:00:34.280 --> 03:00:34.760]  Slugs?
[03:00:35.741 --> 03:00:37.162]  We've created slugs.
[03:00:37.782 --> 03:00:38.322]  They can't hear.
[03:00:38.342 --> 03:00:39.403]  They can't speak.
[03:00:39.783 --> 03:00:40.904]  They can't operate machinery.
[03:00:40.924 --> 03:00:43.205]  I mean, are we not in the hands of a lunatic?
[03:00:46.247 --> 03:00:50.289]  If I were creating a world, I wouldn't mess about with butterflies and daffodils.
[03:00:50.309 --> 03:00:52.170]  I would've started with lasers.
[03:00:52.451 --> 03:00:53.431]  Eight o'clock, day one.
[03:00:56.133 --> 03:00:56.393]  Sorry.
[03:00:57.726 --> 03:01:01.728]  I just can't wait for the new technological dawn.
[03:01:03.749 --> 03:01:04.409]  No!
[03:01:04.649 --> 03:01:06.990]  Alright, that's enough.
[03:01:07.470 --> 03:01:08.591]  That's such a good movie.
[03:01:09.351 --> 03:01:12.392]  Terry Gilliam's a genius.
[03:01:12.512 --> 03:01:14.093]  Patrick in Illinois, you're on the air.
[03:01:14.153 --> 03:01:14.613]  Go ahead.
[03:01:15.333 --> 03:01:15.574]  Hello.
[03:01:15.994 --> 03:01:16.234]  Hey.
[03:01:16.934 --> 03:01:17.374]  Hi, Alex.
[03:01:17.534 --> 03:01:21.776]  I'm glad you're talking about people getting angry and doing something.
[03:01:22.617 --> 03:01:25.578]  I like Mark Dice's model of calling into different radio stations.
[03:01:26.630 --> 03:01:28.771]  A frequent one I call is a guy named Norman Goldman.
[03:01:29.492 --> 03:01:31.673]  You like that establishment, liberal kind of rag.
[03:01:31.693 --> 03:01:38.678]  And as soon as you mention Ron Paul or you mention any real issues, or that Obama's bought off by Wall Street, they'll just cut you right off.
[03:01:39.738 --> 03:01:48.524]  But I think it's a good thing to do, you know, call into liberal or any radio shows and try and get something about the NDAA or that both parties are bought off.
[03:01:48.964 --> 03:01:49.825]  And, uh, yeah.
[03:01:50.465 --> 03:01:54.428]  And just really keep hammering them, like, with the phone mobs and
[03:01:55.106 --> 03:02:00.806]  You may have to use a pseudonym every once in a while, but I think it's a good way to get some information out there.
[03:02:01.664 --> 03:02:02.324]  Absolutely!
[03:02:02.344 --> 03:02:03.905]  I mean, we're talking about all this tyranny.
[03:02:04.466 --> 03:02:11.730]  Plugging websites, calling a talk radio, doing your own local show, getting your own access TV show, using every medium we can to warn people.
[03:02:12.030 --> 03:02:14.712]  Because folks, when they hear the truth now, jump on it.
[03:02:15.052 --> 03:02:18.034]  People are hungry for this information.
[03:02:18.454 --> 03:02:21.156]  Telling people about radio shows that are telling the truth.
[03:02:21.656 --> 03:02:23.998]  Getting the buzz going for Ron Paul even more.
[03:02:24.718 --> 03:02:26.559]  Making copies of DVD films.
[03:02:26.599 --> 03:02:28.761]  God bless you, good to hear from you, keep it up, Doug.
[03:02:32.176 --> 03:02:33.097]  Doug is the next caller.
[03:02:33.818 --> 03:02:34.979]  Doug in Illinois, go ahead.
[03:02:36.240 --> 03:02:36.841]  Hello, Alex.
[03:02:37.061 --> 03:02:37.421]  Hey, buddy.
[03:02:38.462 --> 03:02:38.983]  Hey, how's it going?
[03:02:39.003 --> 03:02:39.604]  You're looking good.
[03:02:41.285 --> 03:02:42.206]  First time caller.
[03:02:42.426 --> 03:02:44.028]  I gotta tell you, I am awake now.
[03:02:45.970 --> 03:02:48.032]  I'm a subscriber to the Prison Planet.
[03:02:48.172 --> 03:02:50.715]  I've got your stickers on my truck.
[03:02:51.595 --> 03:02:55.019]  And for quite some time, I guess you could say I was half asleep.
[03:02:55.977 --> 03:03:04.745]  And maybe I kept hitting the snooze button, but I'm fully awake now, and I'm trying to wage the Info War here in West Central Illinois.
[03:03:07.067 --> 03:03:09.689]  Well, we just had another call from Illinois, so there's a lot of folks.
[03:03:09.729 --> 03:03:11.971]  I get a lot of calls, a lot of support from Illinois.
[03:03:12.371 --> 03:03:17.496]  People certainly are waking up there because they're living under such a nasty form of bureaucratic tyranny.
[03:03:18.433 --> 03:03:19.693]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:03:19.973 --> 03:03:21.214]  Crooked tyranny.
[03:03:22.874 --> 03:03:44.721]  I've got to tell you, something that I've been doing is, on my BlackBerry phone, what I'll do is, from your website, pretty much daily, I'll pick one or two articles and cut or copy and paste them to a media message and send them out to the contacts in my phone attached with an appropriate picture or whatever.
[03:03:44.741 --> 03:03:47.162]  You see, victory is so easy.
[03:03:48.379 --> 03:03:56.426]  Pick the media that you think is the most effective, and then hit your email list, your Facebook, your Twitter, your phone contacts.
[03:03:56.527 --> 03:03:57.067]  Exactly.
[03:03:57.427 --> 03:03:59.229]  Just communicate with people.
[03:03:59.749 --> 03:04:04.294]  There's already so many of us that are awake, and then other people are wondering what's going on.
[03:04:04.654 --> 03:04:06.356]  This will really hurt the globalists.
[03:04:06.376 --> 03:04:12.541]  That's why they're moving to start curtailing the web right now, because they know it's a chink in their pot-bellied armor.
[03:04:12.581 --> 03:04:12.922]  Go ahead.
[03:04:14.488 --> 03:04:15.869]  No, you're exactly right.
[03:04:16.490 --> 03:04:26.037]  I'll usually end my little media text message there with the article and I'll urge them to forward to everybody they know or friends and family.
[03:04:26.737 --> 03:04:35.003]  I've gotten a couple negative responses back and I've dropped the individuals from my forward list.
[03:04:35.764 --> 03:04:38.206]  The way to do it is to say, what do you think of this?
[03:04:39.488 --> 03:04:40.489]  I mean, it doesn't even have to be.
[03:04:40.529 --> 03:04:41.330]  You're pushing it on.
[03:04:41.350 --> 03:04:42.691]  I'm like, what do you think of this?
[03:04:43.152 --> 03:04:47.296]  That's always a good way to, to, uh, you know, try to reach out to the people that are in zombie land.
[03:04:47.356 --> 03:04:47.976]  Great job.
[03:04:48.397 --> 03:04:50.098]  Sorry to Brad, Matthew and Merrill.
[03:04:50.118 --> 03:04:51.600]  If you call back tomorrow, I'll get to you first.
[03:04:51.920 --> 03:04:54.162]  Just tell, uh, remind John there on the phone system.
[03:04:54.683 --> 03:04:58.867]  And, uh, I'll see you back tonight, seven o'clock central at info wars, news.com.
[03:05:00.829 --> 03:05:06.234]  There are limitless ways to go into business for yourself, but most involved substantial capital and risk.
