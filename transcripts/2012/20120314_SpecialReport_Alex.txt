[00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:10.516]  In 1953, the CIA and British intelligence staged terror attacks to overthrow the democratically elected leader of Iran, Mohammad Mossadegh.
[00:00:10.996 --> 00:00:16.680]  Mossadegh had nationalized Iran's oil fields and denied British petroleum a monopoly.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.301]  U.S.
[00:00:17.361 --> 00:00:29.949]  and British intelligence operatives launched a successful coup d'etat and overthrew the Iranian government, replacing the regime with a ruthless dictatorship while seizing control of Iran's oil supply.
[00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.462]  We're good.
[00:00:32.227 --> 00:00:34.069]  1964.
[00:00:33.028 --> 00:00:34.069]  U.S.
[00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:40.393]  warships were apparently attacked by North Vietnamese PT boats, an incident that kicked off the U.S.
[00:00:40.453 --> 00:00:42.374]  involvement in the Vietnam War.
[00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:46.857]  The attack was a staged event that never actually took place.
[00:00:47.178 --> 00:00:58.886]  What followed was an excuse by President Lyndon Johnson to dramatically expand the scale of the Vietnam War, ultimately at the cost of 3 or 4 million dead Vietnamese and 58,000 Americans.
[00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:02.945]  June 8, 1967.
[00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:15.097]  The USS Liberty, an American naval vessel sailing off the coast of Gaza, was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of Israel.
[00:01:15.438 --> 00:01:25.508]  The well-coordinated attack, which lasted for hours, resulted in the deaths of 34 crewmen, 170 injured, and catastrophic damage to the ship.
[00:01:25.908 --> 00:01:28.650]  One of the most highly decorated vessels in U.S.
[00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.150]  history.
[00:01:29.571 --> 00:01:34.694]  Egypt was to be blamed for the attack, to serve as a pretext to drag the U.S.
[00:01:34.814 --> 00:01:37.296]  and her allies into war in the Middle East.
[00:01:37.676 --> 00:01:44.901]  If not for the heroic efforts of the ship's captain and his brave crew, the Liberty would have faced almost certain destruction.
[00:01:45.481 --> 00:01:53.727]  The truth about Israel's attack and subsequent White House cover-up continues to be officially concealed from the American people to this day.
