[00:00:04.946 --> 00:00:09.791]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.791 --> 00:00:11.392]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.392 --> 00:00:12.914]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.914 --> 00:00:17.118]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.118 --> 00:00:21.182]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.343 --> 00:00:37.547]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Wednesday, the 22nd day of August 2012.
[00:00:37.547 --> 00:00:49.680]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours, and we have just got so much, so much incredible news.
[00:00:51.431 --> 00:00:52.131]  To cover.
[00:00:52.131 --> 00:00:56.594]  The TSA is showing up now on more street corners.
[00:00:56.594 --> 00:01:01.797]  TSA rifles their bags, conducts pat-downs at Paul Ryan event.
[00:01:01.797 --> 00:01:10.322]  They're now showing up, ladies and gentlemen, at train stations, bus stations, highways.
[00:01:10.322 --> 00:01:19.668]  They're now showing up at school proms in places like New Mexico.
[00:01:20.856 --> 00:01:23.397]  It is all off the chart what's happening.
[00:01:23.397 --> 00:01:24.617]  We've got so much news.
[00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:35.041]  It's just crazy federal goons out of their jurisdiction that aren't even sworn or bonded, violating the Fourth Amendment that even police can't do.
[00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:38.062]  God help us, this is so horrible.
[00:01:38.062 --> 00:01:38.682]  Steve Watson.
[00:01:39.770 --> 00:02:00.826]  There's an article on that and I saw that earlier today and it hit me like a ton of bricks and then I've kind of forgotten about it and then I'm just sitting here looking at computer screens scrolling through headlines of Infowars.com and a lot of times I'll be sitting there while a guest is talking or something's going on, they'll walk in and drop some new news in front of me and I just go into a tailspin and I was thinking about that today.
[00:02:00.826 --> 00:02:02.267]  How do I deal with this?
[00:02:02.267 --> 00:02:03.188]  How do you deal with this?
[00:02:03.948 --> 00:02:06.109]  You've got engineered economic collapse.
[00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:12.252]  You've got open calls for giant wars in Syria and with Iran.
[00:02:12.252 --> 00:02:18.276]  You've got the police being trained to basically see the American people as their enemy.
[00:02:18.276 --> 00:02:26.640]  We've got incredibly immoral global mega corporations running our lives, who are totally ruthless.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.302]  And it's just getting crazier and crazier and crazier.
[00:02:29.302 --> 00:02:30.902]  So we're going to go over
[00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:35.920]  Steve Watson's report on that front.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.601]  Very, very chilling, and there's photos and videos of it.
[00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:42.662]  Government agents moving out of airports and into the streets.
[00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:46.004]  Again, I told you 10 years ago this was coming, but it's actually happening.
[00:02:46.004 --> 00:02:47.004]  It's so evil!
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:55.043]  The Texas Legislature tried to stop it, and the Feds threatened an armed blockade, and it wasn't even really news.
[00:02:55.043 --> 00:03:00.486]  It was in the news, but, oh, we'll put F-16s in the air to shoot down aircraft that come into your state.
[00:03:00.486 --> 00:03:03.348]  I mean, just such terrorists.
[00:03:03.348 --> 00:03:06.729]  So that article's up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:09.451]  Supporters fear Facebook Marine being disappeared.
[00:03:09.451 --> 00:03:13.233]  The guy that talked about 9-11 truths, they came and grabbed him and drug him away.
[00:03:13.233 --> 00:03:15.114]  There's video of that.
[00:03:17.984 --> 00:03:20.485]  Man kicked off a flight over anti-TSA shirt.
[00:03:20.485 --> 00:03:21.686]  Yeah, you don't have First Amendment in.
[00:03:21.686 --> 00:03:23.967]  What do you think this is, America?
[00:03:23.967 --> 00:03:26.788]  The MF Global Magical Mystery Tour.
[00:03:26.788 --> 00:03:30.991]  Again, federal court ruling that they can take your private bank accounts.
[00:03:30.991 --> 00:03:33.912]  That's just the way it is.
[00:03:33.912 --> 00:03:37.674]  Continuing here.
[00:03:37.674 --> 00:03:40.675]  We're going to get to a whole plethora of important news.
[00:03:40.675 --> 00:03:44.517]  And then I told you that this was coming.
[00:03:44.517 --> 00:03:46.759]  This is from Reuters because
[00:03:49.144 --> 00:03:52.426]  So to a great extent, DARPA is headed up by MIT.
[00:03:52.426 --> 00:04:00.731]  And MIT said, first time I read it about 15 years ago, in the future, you'll have smart meters that run all the appliances in your house and track you.
[00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:06.215]  And all the cars will have satellite tracker boxes that actually control the car.
[00:04:06.215 --> 00:04:11.458]  And that basically robots will run and drive everything that are pre-programmed and controlled by the globalist.
[00:04:11.458 --> 00:04:17.382]  Well, here it is, US testing talking cars to avoid crashes, congestion, and the things track you and control you.
[00:04:19.335 --> 00:04:23.659]  So, and then if you're against this, they say, oh, you're a Luddite.
[00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:24.980]  You're against technology.
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.481]  No, I like technology.
[00:04:26.481 --> 00:04:36.850]  It's the globalists are designing all of this and selling it to us under one name, but we're paying for all of the backdoor tech and tracking systems that are really meant to enslave us.
[00:04:39.301 --> 00:04:41.023]  Okay, it's a total surveillance grid.
[00:04:41.023 --> 00:04:42.384]  It's a hellish system.
[00:04:42.384 --> 00:04:55.415]  We have to make a decision as citizens, as consumers, to vote with our dollars and vote with our feet and say no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:04:55.415 --> 00:04:56.896]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:56.896 --> 00:04:58.638]  Huge amounts of news in your phone calls.
[00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:05.651]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:08.072]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:05:08.072 --> 00:05:13.774]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure.
[00:05:13.774 --> 00:05:17.176]  And it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:05:17.176 --> 00:05:20.617]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[00:05:20.617 --> 00:05:22.298]  There's no priming required.
[00:05:22.298 --> 00:05:24.579]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:27.080]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.660]  Easy to set up and use.
[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.081]  Doesn't require electricity.
[00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:34.261]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:05:34.261 --> 00:05:37.642]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:05:37.642 --> 00:05:41.783]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:05:41.783 --> 00:05:44.523]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:05:44.523 --> 00:05:46.083]  It's what my family uses.
[00:05:46.083 --> 00:05:49.404]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.

[00:06:00.488 --> 00:06:03.970]  Supernatural silver is not an ionic or a colloidal silver.
[00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:09.554]  It is a nanocatalytic silver cell technology with superior benefits to the colloidal silvers of yesterday.
[00:06:09.554 --> 00:06:13.256]  This new molecular structure is permanently bonded to water.
[00:06:13.256 --> 00:06:19.560]  It is the only water-soluble silver that is 99% bioavailable and non-toxic with no known side effects.

[00:06:41.343 --> 00:06:43.904]  No silver solution is better or safer.

[00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:05.698]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.698 --> 00:08:07.981]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:19.637 --> 00:08:25.622]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us in defense of liberty and resistance to tyranny.
[00:08:25.622 --> 00:08:32.107]  I am Alexander Emmerich Jones of Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:08:32.107 --> 00:08:37.991]  Our news websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and we're streaming video.
[00:08:38.972 --> 00:08:43.174]  of the radio show at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:08:43.174 --> 00:08:51.617]  If you're a radio listener and hear me say, put this up on screen, let's play that clip, let's do that, it just adds an added level of documentation.
[00:08:51.617 --> 00:09:07.943]  I started doing this, taping the radio show when it was live and then airing it on local cable access because people wouldn't believe me when I would have an Associated Press article that said the Federal Reserve had been caught shipping in, you know, three tons of pure cocaine into San Antonio.
[00:09:10.273 --> 00:09:13.194]  I would read a headline like that and people wouldn't believe it.
[00:09:13.194 --> 00:09:26.981]  Or I'd read an article out of Newcastle, PA where a man yelled back at a police dog that was in a Walmart parking lot that was barking at him so he was arrested for assaulting an officer verbally.
[00:09:26.981 --> 00:09:29.843]  People didn't believe that when I was on the radio show.
[00:09:29.843 --> 00:09:32.044]  I started InfoWars.com in 1997.
[00:09:32.044 --> 00:09:36.366]  It's already been on the air a few years because people
[00:09:38.587 --> 00:09:40.828]  Didn't believe articles I was reading.
[00:09:40.828 --> 00:09:43.249]  I would go down to the local periodical news shop.
[00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:45.650]  It was called News.
[00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:48.771]  One half of the store was periodicals from all over the country.
[00:09:48.771 --> 00:09:50.592]  The other half was porn.
[00:09:50.592 --> 00:09:55.434]  But just in 1995-96, most of the internet didn't have a lot of news on it.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:04.868]  They had like the Drudge Report and stuff that would link to reports, or he'd write about reports, but mainstream news didn't even really have websites then that had much news.
[00:10:04.868 --> 00:10:07.951]  So you'd have to, you know, I'd go to Barnes and Noble sometimes.
[00:10:07.951 --> 00:10:13.256]  They had a small periodical area, but it wasn't updated like news, a local place in Austin.
[00:10:13.256 --> 00:10:14.938]  I would go in there every day.
[00:10:14.938 --> 00:10:17.821]  I had a six day a week radio show by 1997.
[00:10:21.064 --> 00:10:27.049]  The point is, I would go and clip out all these articles and come on air and cover it, and people would just say, oh, that's not true.
[00:10:27.049 --> 00:10:32.314]  So I started scanning them in and started doing things like that at InfoWars.com, and that's how it was born.
[00:10:33.972 --> 00:10:36.034]  And so that's why we stream video.
[00:10:36.034 --> 00:10:43.599]  And now, of course, most talk shows, you know, they started 10 years ago having a webcam or something, but we have a five camera shoot in here and so much more.
[00:10:43.599 --> 00:10:53.485]  So that's why it's important to become members of PrisonPlanet.TV, because then you can see the daily radio show and the nightly news show and all the films and 17 years of material that we've uploaded up on the site.
[00:10:53.485 --> 00:10:56.167]  We've had PrisonPlanet.TV for nine and a half years now.
[00:10:56.947 --> 00:11:01.232]  I digress though, that is not what I meant to get into here at the start of the broadcast.
[00:11:01.232 --> 00:11:05.317]  Incredible news that we're going to be breaking down on so many fronts.
[00:11:05.317 --> 00:11:10.583]  Just when you thought you'd heard it all with the TSA, the TSA is now at campaign events.
[00:11:10.583 --> 00:11:15.448]  TSA rifles through bags, conducts pat-downs at Paul Ryan event.
[00:11:15.448 --> 00:11:16.309]  So they're now at
[00:11:18.354 --> 00:11:20.355]  Santa Fe proms.
[00:11:20.355 --> 00:11:21.495]  By the way, people won't believe that.
[00:11:21.495 --> 00:11:27.358]  Type in TSA, Judge Rules TSA must be at Santa Fe prom.
[00:11:27.358 --> 00:11:30.779]  They're now popping up in Dallas, San Antonio, and Houston.
[00:11:30.779 --> 00:11:35.961]  I'm told by police sources that the next few months they'll be here in Austin.
[00:11:35.961 --> 00:11:43.504]  The Army, I didn't get it on tape, but I talked to a police officer friend of mine up in Temple last week, ran another checkpoint on the highway.
[00:11:43.504 --> 00:11:47.066]  We've gotten it on tape twice, but this time we didn't get it on tape.
[00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:49.282]  I don't
[00:12:08.876 --> 00:12:09.296]  30 minutes.
[00:12:09.296 --> 00:12:11.817]  It's funny I'm mentioning AXS TV.
[00:12:11.817 --> 00:12:17.519]  Linda Lutowski, who's a nice lady who worked at AXS, I don't know, 30-something years ago.
[00:12:17.519 --> 00:12:20.260]  The 40th anniversary of Austin AXS Television.
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:21.260]  You're like, why do I care?
[00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.381]  This is a national show.
[00:12:23.381 --> 00:12:23.861]  I'm saying, why?
[00:12:23.861 --> 00:12:26.282]  Some of you are like, why am I covering this?
[00:12:26.282 --> 00:12:30.423]  AXS Television was born in Austin, Texas, and they're trying to get rid of it.
[00:12:30.423 --> 00:12:37.526]  But the real reason we're having her on is just to talk about the fact that they tried to shut it down a few years ago until I discovered
[00:12:38.735 --> 00:12:46.021]  The fraud going on, and we got some of the folks to be sent to prison, and then Linda and others who'd been there decades ago were able to come back in and keep it afloat.
[00:12:46.021 --> 00:13:00.313]  So I want to talk about AXS TV itself, nationwide, still there, still a really good avenue for people to break into media, to get information out, to air films, to air material, where you're going to get an audience that really isn't getting their news from the web.
[00:13:01.161 --> 00:13:07.809]  I mean, a big city like Austin, hundreds of thousands can see your show because they're surfing through basic cable.
[00:13:07.809 --> 00:13:14.597]  But in mega cities like New York, I mean, so many careers have been launched in comedy, news, you name it, with access.
[00:13:14.597 --> 00:13:16.178]  So many people want to break into media.
[00:13:16.178 --> 00:13:17.380]  They go get a degree.
[00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.684]  They go labor for a decade at a radio station and get laid off.
[00:13:21.024 --> 00:13:28.150]  When instead, you should start your own YouTube show, you should start your own blog, radio show, you should start... Just do it!
[00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:31.313]  Do it for the passion, and you'll have success.
[00:13:31.313 --> 00:13:39.200]  All these other people get into Patriot Media trying to be big stars, and they're not successful, because they want immediate success.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.122]  You have to want to defeat the New World Order.
[00:13:42.122 --> 00:13:43.103]  And I know a lot of you do.
[00:13:43.103 --> 00:13:45.925]  So you're always asking me to do this, or do that, or hire you.
[00:13:45.925 --> 00:13:46.466]  I don't have the money.
[00:13:47.421 --> 00:13:50.227]  But I'm here telling you ways to get involved.
[00:13:50.227 --> 00:13:52.371]  So that's the last 30 minutes of the show.
[00:13:52.371 --> 00:13:56.138]  Now before I launch into news, and believe me, it is a lot here.
[00:13:57.813 --> 00:13:59.594]  And I want to talk about military suicides.
[00:13:59.594 --> 00:14:02.176]  We've talked about this quite a bit, but I want to really delve into it today.
[00:14:02.176 --> 00:14:04.397]  So I'm going to do that at the start of the next hour.
[00:14:04.397 --> 00:14:12.623]  I'm going to give the number out in a few minutes and really try to go to your calls early in the shower after I hit a smattering of some of the headlines that we have here.
[00:14:12.623 --> 00:14:15.345]  They're bringing in news so fast, making my head spin right now.
[00:14:15.345 --> 00:14:17.406]  This is a big issue, though.
[00:14:17.406 --> 00:14:22.490]  If you're watching at PrisonPlanet.tv, I have in my little hands the economic collapse
[00:14:24.079 --> 00:14:34.184]  And today at the end of the show, we will send out a e-copy that you can flip just like a regular magazine or newspaper.
[00:14:34.184 --> 00:14:40.847]  I am going to be sending this out to people that sign up for free at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:14:41.718 --> 00:14:46.121]  You can just go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter, just put your email in, that's all you gotta do.
[00:14:46.121 --> 00:14:57.028]  Hit submit, and today at 2 o'clock central, that's 3 o'clock eastern, we will send it out to anybody and everybody that has signed up to get a free copy.
[00:14:57.028 --> 00:15:00.750]  Now, here is the issue, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:04.373]  We printed 50,000 copies at one printer that were put on the streets of Austin.
[00:15:05.273 --> 00:15:07.394]  It'll be the collector's edition with the typo on the cover.
[00:15:07.394 --> 00:15:07.954]  I love it.
[00:15:07.954 --> 00:15:08.955]  Gotta love it.
[00:15:08.955 --> 00:15:10.876]  But it's an incredible magazine.
[00:15:10.876 --> 00:15:13.617]  So much key information.
[00:15:13.617 --> 00:15:25.402]  We were gonna print 20,000 copies to put one free in every order for books, videos, t-shirts, stuff at InfoWarshop.com.
[00:15:25.402 --> 00:15:28.424]  And we figured that would be enough for people that wanted to buy them at cost.
[00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:35.152]  In bulk, people who wanted them in their orders.
[00:15:35.152 --> 00:15:35.712]  Didn't happen.
[00:15:35.712 --> 00:15:38.233]  They all sold out last night.
[00:15:38.233 --> 00:15:40.194]  They all sold out.
[00:15:40.194 --> 00:15:40.835]  20,000 copies.
[00:15:40.835 --> 00:15:41.355]  Gone.
[00:15:41.355 --> 00:15:42.495]  Boom.
[00:15:42.495 --> 00:15:42.616]  20,000.
[00:15:42.616 --> 00:15:43.956]  Bam.
[00:15:43.956 --> 00:15:47.258]  So, I mean, I knew there was a hunger for this because I had a hunger for it.
[00:15:47.258 --> 00:15:47.978]  I have a hunger for it.
[00:15:47.978 --> 00:15:48.719]  You have a hunger for it.
[00:15:48.719 --> 00:15:50.259]  Because we're all the same.
[00:15:50.259 --> 00:15:52.600]  I mean, we're just humans that love freedom.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:53.401]  I got your number.
[00:15:53.401 --> 00:15:54.321]  You got my number.
[00:15:54.321 --> 00:15:55.342]  We're on the same page.
[00:15:56.496 --> 00:15:57.257]  Doesn't feel good.
[00:15:57.257 --> 00:16:00.440]  20,000 BAM sold.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.561]  So I don't know what to print.
[00:16:01.561 --> 00:16:02.922]  Do I print 20,000 more?
[00:16:02.922 --> 00:16:04.524]  50,000 more?
[00:16:04.524 --> 00:16:07.226]  They're gonna print them today.
[00:16:07.226 --> 00:16:08.808]  They're gonna print them today.
[00:16:08.808 --> 00:16:09.589]  So we'll have them.
[00:16:09.589 --> 00:16:11.330]  So we're keeping the order stuff up there.
[00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:15.595]  If you want to order the new magazine, I'm making the executive decision.
[00:16:15.595 --> 00:16:17.797]  We're gonna print 20,000 copies more and that's it.
[00:16:19.284 --> 00:16:21.866]  Okay, 20,000 copies more and that's it.
[00:16:21.866 --> 00:16:25.709]  And I did just raise the price a couple dollars on each poll quarter because they did the math today.
[00:16:25.709 --> 00:16:26.569]  The computers can do it.
[00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:30.692]  We lost money because I just kind of, you know, they said yesterday, why don't we put it in the cart?
[00:16:30.692 --> 00:16:31.913]  We've been asking for a week.
[00:16:31.913 --> 00:16:33.094]  I said, this number sounds good.
[00:16:33.094 --> 00:16:34.355]  That number sounds good.
[00:16:34.355 --> 00:16:42.241]  But after, I mean, when, but, but, but we factor in, you know, on a hundred order or a 50 order or whatever, we factor in, you know, what the shipping is.
[00:16:42.241 --> 00:16:43.582]  A hundred of them is like 15 pounds.
[00:16:44.182 --> 00:16:47.764]  And I guess I miscalculated a bit because we're actually losing money on some of them.
[00:16:47.764 --> 00:16:54.529]  So I've upped them all, you know, 10 packs, not $9.95, it's $14.95.
[00:16:54.529 --> 00:17:00.453]  And then, you know, we've upped them all a little bit just because we cannot even deal with it.
[00:17:00.453 --> 00:17:09.539]  We're going to have to probably hire three, four more shipping people part-time or, well, not part-time, full-time, but just as temporary to be technical just to get all these out.
[00:17:09.539 --> 00:17:11.980]  We've kind of created a crisis here.
[00:17:14.234 --> 00:17:17.435]  So that's why I'm saying I'm printing 20,000 more and that's it.
[00:17:17.435 --> 00:17:19.896]  When it sells out, and undoubtedly it will, that's it.
[00:17:19.896 --> 00:17:25.218]  Because I've got to make major changes, break down the numbers, look at it, to be able to even handle this.
[00:17:25.218 --> 00:17:29.119]  I mean, this is going big right now.
[00:17:29.119 --> 00:17:32.160]  20,000, bam, in less than 12 hours.
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:32.600]  Bam, gone.
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:32.940]  Gone.
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:33.800]  20,000, gone.
[00:17:36.167 --> 00:17:39.668]  So, we're going to print 20,000 more.
[00:17:39.668 --> 00:17:41.769]  They were in there asking me seconds before I went live.
[00:17:41.769 --> 00:17:45.450]  20,000 more and that's it, because that's all we can handle.
[00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:49.031]  That's all we can handle, shipping out to people.
[00:17:49.031 --> 00:17:51.932]  It's caused, quite frankly, a disaster.
[00:17:51.932 --> 00:17:55.793]  But they're going to stay as late as it takes to get them all out to you.
[00:17:55.793 --> 00:17:58.934]  So again, get your orders in now for the InfoWars magazine.
[00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:03.622]  I'm gonna go to break and come back with all the news, but here's what it covers.
[00:18:03.622 --> 00:18:05.183]  The economic collapse.
[00:18:05.183 --> 00:18:06.684]  Where does money come from?
[00:18:06.684 --> 00:18:07.685]  Rome burned, will we?
[00:18:07.685 --> 00:18:09.466]  A brief history of false flag attacks.
[00:18:09.466 --> 00:18:12.428]  It's designed for the mainstream public who is unaware.
[00:18:12.428 --> 00:18:14.409]  This is a weapon to wake people up, folks.
[00:18:14.409 --> 00:18:16.271]  A brief history of false flag attacks.
[00:18:16.271 --> 00:18:19.813]  The shadowy Patsy rises again.
[00:18:19.813 --> 00:18:22.154]  Bank cartel conquers America.
[00:18:22.154 --> 00:18:23.815]  Liberty lovers listed as terrorists.
[00:18:23.815 --> 00:18:24.936]  Homeland Security.
[00:18:24.936 --> 00:18:26.037]  Obama jobs program.
[00:18:27.421 --> 00:18:29.622]  Haunted by Hitler, Gerald Cilente article.
[00:18:29.622 --> 00:18:31.864]  The Second Amendment, Big Pharma exposed.
[00:18:31.864 --> 00:18:35.706]  UN uses China as launching pad for global one-child policy.
[00:18:35.706 --> 00:18:40.029]  Genetically modified apples are the newest GMO creation pushed on consumers.
[00:18:40.029 --> 00:18:41.590]  Ron Paul article.
[00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:46.213]  And just so much more is all here.
[00:18:46.213 --> 00:18:53.578]  My message to everybody about print 2.0, because look, print is dying because it's all run by globalists with a bunch of lies.
[00:18:53.578 --> 00:18:55.619]  Because even globalist mainstream media is dying.
[00:18:56.727 --> 00:19:05.433]  Even globalist mainstream media is dying online because no one trusts you, no one likes you.
[00:19:05.433 --> 00:19:11.257]  And so again, if you want to get the magazine, I suggest you order it right now.
[00:19:11.257 --> 00:19:14.780]  Because we're printing 20,000 more and when they're gone, that's it.
[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:17.342]  20,000 sold in less than a day.
[00:19:19.003 --> 00:19:21.684]  20,000 are probably going to sell in the next few days.
[00:19:21.684 --> 00:19:24.525]  If you want it, you've got to order it now.
[00:19:24.525 --> 00:19:25.965]  Infowarshop.com.
[00:19:25.965 --> 00:19:27.406]  In fact, there are the prices.
[00:19:27.406 --> 00:19:27.906]  10 packs, $14.95.
[00:19:27.906 --> 00:19:28.406]  Scroll down.

[00:19:39.841 --> 00:19:41.743]  And we've got a 100-pack for $99.95.
[00:19:41.743 --> 00:19:49.870]  You notice the one that went up the most was the 10-pack, because the shipping and handling, that's the one we're really losing money on, so we went up on that more than the others.

[00:20:08.117 --> 00:20:09.818]  Here's the really bad news.

[00:20:16.363 --> 00:20:25.069]  In fact, the Wall Street Journal reported that we could soon face blackouts lasting weeks or months, leaving major parts of the USA temporarily uninhabitable.

[00:24:22.222 --> 00:24:27.543]  Keep your foot hard on the pedal, son, never mind them brakes.
[00:24:27.543 --> 00:24:30.244]  Let it all hang out, cause we got a run to make.
[00:24:30.244 --> 00:24:36.166]  The boys up there stickin' Atlanta, and there's beer in Texarkana, and we'll bring it on.
[00:24:38.462 --> 00:24:42.687]  Eastbound and down!
[00:24:42.687 --> 00:24:44.550]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:47.113]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:24:47.113 --> 00:24:48.274]  Wow!
[00:24:48.274 --> 00:24:49.536]  Where to begin?
[00:24:56.994 --> 00:25:00.797]  Coming up at the start of the next hour, I'm going to get into this report.
[00:25:00.797 --> 00:25:01.217]  U.S.
[00:25:01.217 --> 00:25:09.724]  Army grants $3 million for anti-suicide nasal spray research because the suicides are at all-time mega records.
[00:25:09.724 --> 00:25:12.426]  Seven to eight times previous records.
[00:25:12.426 --> 00:25:20.392]  I've got all the death statistics here from the Department of Defense, military personnel and veteran suicide prevention graphs.
[00:25:20.392 --> 00:25:24.055]  We're going to be going over all of that and I'm going to explain to you why this is happening.
[00:25:27.899 --> 00:25:29.742]  I'll go ahead and tell you the main reason.
[00:25:29.742 --> 00:25:40.240]  They're putting them on serotonin reuptake inhibitors that on the insert says destroys your your lack of restraint.
[00:25:42.346 --> 00:25:44.247]  It's where if you feel like killing yourself, you just do it.
[00:25:44.247 --> 00:25:46.970]  If you feel like killing others, you just do it.
[00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:49.051]  It is in the hallucinogen class.
[00:25:49.051 --> 00:25:50.993]  That's the biggest issue.
[00:25:50.993 --> 00:25:57.698]  Because Big Pharma runs things and runs the kook cult of psychiatrists and psychologists, they're going to keep doing this.
[00:25:57.698 --> 00:26:01.901]  And it's a cocktail of other reasons, but I always say something's coming up, then just get to it.
[00:26:01.901 --> 00:26:04.984]  I'm going to talk about all that in the next hour.
[00:26:04.984 --> 00:26:05.144]  Okay?
[00:26:07.793 --> 00:26:08.853]  Let's just do this.
[00:26:08.853 --> 00:26:14.476]  I get so wound up with all this news, and then I never even cover it because I get so upset.
[00:26:14.476 --> 00:26:18.178]  Let's just give the number out and take calls on whatever you want to discuss.
[00:26:18.178 --> 00:26:22.160]  Yesterday I said I wanted to talk about the melting down economy, the preparations for collapse.
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.360]  Do you think there'll be a collapse?
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.401]  And almost none of the callers called out about that.
[00:26:25.401 --> 00:26:28.122]  They called in with their personal stories or whatever.
[00:26:28.122 --> 00:26:28.482]  Whatever.
[00:26:28.482 --> 00:26:31.564]  I want to talk to the callers, but I want to hear your take on that.
[00:26:31.564 --> 00:26:33.665]  Your take is on the general craziness of the world.
[00:26:35.031 --> 00:26:35.171]  800-259-9231.
[00:26:35.171 --> 00:26:36.192]  800-259-9231.
[00:26:36.192 --> 00:26:44.938]  I do have an angle on Prince Harry.
[00:26:44.938 --> 00:26:50.081]  Naked pictures at Las Vegas party with his friends.
[00:26:50.081 --> 00:26:55.024]  Yeah, those are real good friends that are taking pictures of you running around having an orgy.
[00:26:55.024 --> 00:27:01.028]  They're spinning it as a... playing a naked game of pool.
[00:27:02.651 --> 00:27:04.092]  Billiards.
[00:27:04.092 --> 00:27:05.693]  In fact, don't even show the photos, guys.
[00:27:05.693 --> 00:27:08.195]  I don't want to show them on TV.
[00:27:08.195 --> 00:27:13.938]  And it just shows media control.
[00:27:13.938 --> 00:27:16.800]  If somebody the globalist didn't like was doing that, it'd be over for him.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.621]  But the media is like, oh, what's the big deal?
[00:27:18.621 --> 00:27:19.382]  He's in Vegas.
[00:27:19.382 --> 00:27:25.306]  They're just playing a naked game of billiards, like strip poker.
[00:27:25.306 --> 00:27:29.228]  Yeah, that's why there's shots of him bending women over and having sex with them.
[00:27:29.228 --> 00:27:30.909]  I mean, that's what that is.
[00:27:30.909 --> 00:27:31.870]  You got a woman bent over.
[00:27:34.946 --> 00:27:37.808]  He's obviously having sex with her.
[00:27:37.808 --> 00:27:39.550]  She's penetrated.
[00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:44.054]  And normally, I wouldn't cover a piece of tabloid news like this unless there's a teaching point in it.
[00:27:44.054 --> 00:27:45.194]  A teaching moment.
[00:27:45.194 --> 00:27:50.999]  And you notice here, he's got a blonde bent over at the table having sex with her.
[00:27:50.999 --> 00:27:51.860]  That's what this is.
[00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:54.622]  The prince having sex with a woman.
[00:27:54.622 --> 00:27:55.483]  And they spin it.
[00:27:55.483 --> 00:27:56.324]  That's what spin is.
[00:27:56.324 --> 00:28:01.768]  Oh, it was just a fun naked game of pool at a private party called an orgy.
[00:28:01.768 --> 00:28:03.770]  The headline should be Prince Caught in Orgy.
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:21.369]  Remember, a bunch of Republicans were out on a boat in Israel, in the Mediterranean, and some of them didn't have swim shorts, so they discreetly, with towels, at night, took the towels off and jumped in naked.
[00:28:21.369 --> 00:28:22.930]  Others were wearing their underwear.
[00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:25.211]  And the FBI investigated.
[00:28:25.211 --> 00:28:26.833]  Oh my gosh!
[00:28:26.833 --> 00:28:28.314]  What's going on here?
[00:28:30.526 --> 00:28:32.006]  And again, I'm not even defending the Republicans.
[00:28:32.006 --> 00:28:36.808]  It just shows because the White House and Justice Department are a bunch of criminals who are political.
[00:28:36.808 --> 00:28:43.369]  They went after the Republicans for, reportedly, out of about 20 people, maybe one or two, stripped off naked.
[00:28:43.369 --> 00:28:48.851]  Well, yeah, when you're wearing a suit, you don't get in your underwear because then you're going to be wet when you get out.
[00:28:48.851 --> 00:28:53.892]  At night, I've swam naked in the ocean many times.
[00:28:53.892 --> 00:28:54.572]  I guess I'm evil.
[00:28:55.848 --> 00:28:59.472]  But the point is, I'm not even judging the Prince.
[00:28:59.472 --> 00:29:00.694]  He's not even the Prince.
[00:29:00.694 --> 00:29:03.697]  His mother was well known, went out with an army officer.
[00:29:03.697 --> 00:29:07.542]  The spitting image of Prince Harry.
[00:29:07.542 --> 00:29:10.065]  Prince Charles has even been caught shooting his mouth off about it.
[00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:14.311]  It's just, it's just an example of media spin.
[00:29:14.311 --> 00:29:18.213]  And that's not our top story, but that's the first thing over here on my right-hand side of the stack.
[00:29:18.213 --> 00:29:20.394]  So I'm gonna come back, run through some more of these.
[00:29:20.394 --> 00:29:23.516]  It's just an example of how they spin things.
[00:29:23.516 --> 00:29:25.977]  80025 at 99231.
[00:29:25.977 --> 00:29:30.480]  Americans toss out as much as 40% of their food, study says.
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.021]  Very wasteful.
[00:29:32.021 --> 00:29:34.282]  Man kicked off flight over anti-TSA shirt.
[00:29:34.282 --> 00:29:37.323]  California set to issue driver's license to young illegal immigrants.
[00:29:37.323 --> 00:29:38.184]  Yeah, that's happening everywhere.
[00:29:39.491 --> 00:29:44.898]  Robot will throw the first pitch at Detroit Tigers game and soon you won't be able to drive your own cars.
[00:29:44.898 --> 00:29:48.683]  Dartmouth researchers develop slave collars for children and more.
[00:29:48.683 --> 00:29:49.685]  Stay with us.
[00:29:49.685 --> 00:29:51.066]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.066 --> 00:29:53.610]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:56.253]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.256 --> 00:30:06.400]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.362]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[00:30:09.362 --> 00:30:14.745]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[00:30:14.745 --> 00:30:19.728]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[00:30:19.728 --> 00:30:27.033]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods Direct now.
[00:30:27.353 --> 00:30:31.216]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[00:30:31.216 --> 00:30:33.017]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[00:30:33.017 --> 00:30:37.020]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:39.942]  You know about their delicious, long-term, storable foods.
[00:30:39.942 --> 00:30:42.724]  The fact is, you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[00:30:42.724 --> 00:30:47.287]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[00:30:47.287 --> 00:30:47.948]  Don't wait!
[00:30:47.948 --> 00:30:48.188]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:30:48.188 --> 00:30:49.829]  Or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:30:49.829 --> 00:30:49.969]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:30:57.854 --> 00:31:07.199]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid, and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[00:31:07.199 --> 00:31:12.441]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[00:31:12.441 --> 00:31:14.682]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[00:31:14.682 --> 00:31:22.186]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[00:31:22.666 --> 00:31:26.492]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[00:31:26.492 --> 00:31:30.838]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[00:31:30.838 --> 00:31:37.228]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling Power Hub unit.
[00:31:37.688 --> 00:31:40.732]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[00:31:40.732 --> 00:31:43.835]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[00:31:43.835 --> 00:31:47.579]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar-powered.
[00:31:47.579 --> 00:31:50.602]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[00:31:50.602 --> 00:31:55.708]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[00:31:55.708 --> 00:31:57.470]  That's BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[00:32:01.598 --> 00:32:05.559]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:05.559 --> 00:32:14.421]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:32:14.421 --> 00:32:19.062]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:32:19.062 --> 00:32:29.864]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:32:30.504 --> 00:32:40.007]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:40.007 --> 00:32:45.449]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:32:45.449 --> 00:32:52.932]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:52.932 --> 00:32:55.353]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:33:03.874 --> 00:33:20.506]  You know, I heard local talk radio reading out of the Houston Chronicle this morning
[00:33:34.369 --> 00:33:41.915]  And it was the former, I guess she's current state rep, Susanna Hupp doing the show along with the other host.
[00:33:41.915 --> 00:33:58.548]  And they were marveling and wondering aloud why $500 million a month in the state of Texas is given to people on Lone Star food stamp cards and why they can get $50 cash back each time they go and buy cigarettes and liquor with it.
[00:33:59.853 --> 00:34:13.063]  And how a state study showed the majority of it was going to illegal aliens, where the state is told to accept the fake tax ID numbers, and so an illegal can walk in with five fake numbers and get five cards right there.
[00:34:13.063 --> 00:34:17.446]  Illegals can drink and drive and they're left alone, the list goes on and on, because they're God.
[00:34:17.446 --> 00:34:22.950]  The government wants them here to drive down wages and vote for gun control and the destruction of this country.
[00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:26.273]  They work for the collaborator globalists that have taken over the nation.
[00:34:27.423 --> 00:34:34.348]  But I sat there for 30 minutes driving to work, and they just couldn't figure out why this was happening.
[00:34:34.348 --> 00:34:50.781]  Why they're getting rid of our social security, we're going bankrupt, but tens of billions of dollars a month is in food stamps, and they're running ads saying, come get your food stamps, even if you have a job, you probably qualify.
[00:34:50.781 --> 00:34:52.422]  Because they want people dependent.
[00:34:53.547 --> 00:34:56.310]  And they want political armies that are dependent.
[00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:58.893]  Let me explain what this is.
[00:34:58.893 --> 00:35:03.938]  5,000 years ago, let's pick an archaeological area.
[00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:22.305]  In the Tigris-Raphaides sector, they have found primitive pens and areas where humans began to domesticate, even before that, pigs and goats and sheep and horses and dogs and cats.
[00:35:22.305 --> 00:35:24.867]  And do you know how cultures domesticate animals?
[00:35:24.867 --> 00:35:30.453]  Well, one way to do it is to kill the parents and then hand-raise the young, bottle-raise the young.
[00:35:31.862 --> 00:35:45.125]  Or, you can simply start bringing in animals and leaving food out for them, and then build a pen that they come into and eat out of, and then next time they come in to eat, you close the pen, then you start hand-feeding them once they're starving.
[00:35:45.125 --> 00:35:46.466]  That's how you domesticate animals.
[00:35:46.466 --> 00:35:50.586]  And see, that's what this is, is domestication.
[00:35:50.586 --> 00:35:55.528]  And Homeland Security in the last two years has announced they just legalized all the illegal aliens by fiat.
[00:35:55.528 --> 00:35:56.448]  Congress is doing nothing.
[00:35:57.833 --> 00:35:59.474]  Just like they're shutting down our power plants.
[00:35:59.474 --> 00:36:03.816]  Congress wouldn't pass the law to do it, so Obama just did it.
[00:36:03.816 --> 00:36:04.836]  And there's the Houston Chronicle.
[00:36:04.836 --> 00:36:07.097]  Food stamps hit record level in Texas.
[00:36:07.097 --> 00:36:15.621]  And it's all over the country.
[00:36:15.621 --> 00:36:15.721]  And
[00:36:17.862 --> 00:36:21.104]  They will take your house if you haven't paid the property taxes.
[00:36:21.104 --> 00:36:27.007]  Well, most people paid for their houses, but they can't pay the property taxes because they're retired or whatever.
[00:36:27.007 --> 00:36:33.071]  The property taxes on a small house are like $5,000, $6,000 in Austin, where I live, much higher in other areas of the country.
[00:36:33.071 --> 00:36:39.695]  And then when they just come and they auction off your house, and then they come with police who kill you if you try to resist.
[00:36:39.695 --> 00:36:42.757]  So they're killing people, killing them.
[00:36:43.775 --> 00:37:01.085]  If they don't pay their income tax in the private federal reserve, killing people if they don't pay the property tax that didn't exist until 60 years ago, killing people if they, you know, drive through a toll road without paying, the cops chase you down, you're lucky they don't beat you half to death for it because you're a piece of trash who's got to be kept in line.
[00:37:01.085 --> 00:37:02.385]  You're an American scum!
[00:37:02.385 --> 00:37:06.608]  You're a milk cow slave and you better learn it and get it through your head!
[00:37:06.608 --> 00:37:07.888]  But hey boss, why do we care?
[00:37:07.888 --> 00:37:08.669]  We got plenty of food.
[00:37:09.505 --> 00:37:11.726]  Why do we want to gang up on all these ants?
[00:37:11.726 --> 00:37:19.531]  Because those ants outnumber us 100 to 1, and if they ever figure that out, that will end our way of life.
[00:37:19.531 --> 00:37:21.492]  That is how this works.
[00:37:21.492 --> 00:37:23.753]  You know the movie Ants?
[00:37:23.753 --> 00:37:24.593]  Or is it Bugs Life?
[00:37:24.593 --> 00:37:24.994]  I forget.
[00:37:24.994 --> 00:37:28.275]  The point is, I'm trying to find that clip.
[00:37:28.275 --> 00:37:31.097]  I want to play that going out to break if we can.
[00:37:31.097 --> 00:37:32.178]  That's what we're dealing with here.
[00:37:33.211 --> 00:37:44.662]  And I see the cops all amped up, driving around their motorcycles, looking back and forth, and the cops all looking crazed, and it's like, man, you really think you're in Fallujah, because they've been taught we're the enemy.
[00:37:44.662 --> 00:37:48.806]  But an illegal alien is the God.
[00:37:48.806 --> 00:37:51.048]  And I quite frankly am tired of it.
[00:37:51.048 --> 00:37:53.330]  And people say, oh, well, you just don't like the illegal aliens.
[00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:57.675]  Well, bingo, yeah, I don't like the fact that they're teamed up with the globalists and above the law.
[00:37:59.488 --> 00:38:16.921]  And that they can start businesses and not pay taxes and get five or six or seven or eight welfare checks because the system only lets them engage in the open fraud and then drive around in giant brand new cars and have more than citizens do only because they're there in that niche as a weapon to drive down wages.
[00:38:16.921 --> 00:38:21.184]  Because again, the system doesn't let citizens engage in that type of fraud.
[00:38:21.184 --> 00:38:22.405]  They throw the book at you.
[00:38:25.111 --> 00:38:36.576]  I mean, I saw that report that we could have broken, I'm just pointing out that we're here in Austin, that national story a few weeks ago, where the illegals, the IRS just gives them tax ID numbers, knowing as many as they want.
[00:38:36.576 --> 00:38:38.517]  Hey, you want 20 of those?
[00:38:38.517 --> 00:38:50.462]  And with each one, they get tax rebates, they get tax refunds, they get to sign up credit lines, and then they attach it to other people's Social Security numbers, and the banks accept that.
[00:38:50.462 --> 00:38:52.903]  They accept the fraud of the illegals.
[00:38:55.154 --> 00:39:03.579]  And now, California and a bunch of other states that already give more in-state tuition to illegals than they do people who are from the state.
[00:39:03.579 --> 00:39:06.981]  California is set to issue driver's licenses to young illegal immigrants.
[00:39:06.981 --> 00:39:08.622]  California is on the verge of allowing that.
[00:39:08.622 --> 00:39:09.463]  Well, Texas does that.
[00:39:10.604 --> 00:39:12.065]  I mean, they just give them to illegals, period.
[00:39:12.065 --> 00:39:13.806]  I mean, you can go in and get one.
[00:39:13.806 --> 00:39:16.868]  But if you're a citizen, you're treated like trash.
[00:39:16.868 --> 00:39:20.010]  You say, hey, why do I have to show five forms and thumb scan and all this?
[00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:23.452]  And she'll be like, Trooper, I've been arrested going in there doing this.
[00:39:23.452 --> 00:39:27.314]  They'll come over, mow up, you got a problem, this country's ours now, boy.
[00:39:27.314 --> 00:39:29.656]  It's ours now.
[00:39:29.656 --> 00:39:31.977]  We work for Goldman Sachs.
[00:39:31.977 --> 00:39:34.138]  Of course, they don't even know that.
[00:39:34.138 --> 00:39:35.139]  But that's the spirit of it.
[00:39:37.538 --> 00:39:46.927]  And California's on the verge of allowing hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants, they always start with one group, to receive a driver's license for the first time in nearly two decades.
[00:39:46.927 --> 00:39:48.288]  The key question is, how to do it?
[00:39:48.288 --> 00:39:54.433]  They'll just do it like Texas and other states.
[00:39:54.433 --> 00:40:03.401]  I mean, hell, the police all over the country, in 800 plus sanctuary cities, already shipped consular matriculas, and they've got consulates in Austin, in Houston, right here where I live.
[00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:07.701]  And I mean, if you go in there, it's pure nationalism.
[00:40:07.701 --> 00:40:17.426]  They teach in comic books that are handed out in Mexico that the Southwest belongs to Mexico, that white people are evil, and that the United States is going to be taken over.
[00:40:17.426 --> 00:40:21.408]  And again, this isn't even about Hispanics, whites.
[00:40:21.408 --> 00:40:32.012]  This is about a nationalism and a government that is being used by the globalists to help bring down the United States, help break down our culture and what we are.
[00:40:32.012 --> 00:40:33.013]  Our diverse culture.
[00:40:34.209 --> 00:40:36.571]  With a bunch of nationalism.
[00:40:36.571 --> 00:40:42.595]  While the globalists are busy destroying Mexico as well, shipping the drugs into the country.
[00:40:42.595 --> 00:40:48.619]  And we shouldn't sit here and lie to ourselves about all this going on, but this is another example.
[00:40:48.619 --> 00:40:51.681]  Just like they said we're going to stop deporting illegals.
[00:40:51.681 --> 00:40:53.143]  And now they just let them go.
[00:40:53.143 --> 00:40:56.045]  They let aggravated felons go.
[00:40:56.045 --> 00:40:58.606]  The government decides.
[00:40:58.606 --> 00:41:00.508]  That is the bureaucracy, not the Congress.
[00:41:02.196 --> 00:41:05.158]  They even used, remember that article of Fox News AP a few years ago?
[00:41:05.158 --> 00:41:08.339]  Illegals were hired to build the border fence that's just for show.
[00:41:08.339 --> 00:41:12.181]  It's a total for show!
[00:41:12.181 --> 00:41:15.663]  Build a few miles here, a few miles there.
[00:41:15.663 --> 00:41:18.725]  They put giant open gates on it for the wildlife to go through.
[00:41:18.725 --> 00:41:21.346]  I mean, it's a joke.
[00:41:21.346 --> 00:41:23.667]  It's a total sickening joke.
[00:41:23.667 --> 00:41:24.648]  And I just bring this up.
[00:41:25.834 --> 00:41:34.720]  To illustrate what an out-of-control, lawless criminal system we have that ships drugs into the country, guns out of the country, and guns to drug gangs around the U.S.
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:42.525]  and it comes out in federal court and nobody gets in trouble.
[00:41:42.525 --> 00:41:46.427]  Because the public is in a zombie trance state medically.
[00:41:46.427 --> 00:41:50.930]  The average person, medically, has a lower brainwave operating system.
[00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:53.372]  You can pull up the articles on this than they had 20 years ago.
[00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:58.801]  They're at a near sleep state, a daydreaming state.
[00:41:58.801 --> 00:42:00.701]  You say people don't talk to each other anymore?
[00:42:00.701 --> 00:42:01.942]  People look like they're in a daze?
[00:42:01.942 --> 00:42:03.542]  They don't look like they're in a daze.
[00:42:03.542 --> 00:42:06.723]  They're in one.
[00:42:06.723 --> 00:42:14.905]  And that's why you basically got these sharks, these piranhas swimming around in our society, dealing with victims who don't even know who they are.
[00:42:16.752 --> 00:42:23.895]  And then you put combat veterans on a bunch of serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and they start killing themselves and their families.
[00:42:23.895 --> 00:42:25.996]  Because that's what the drugs are designed to do.
[00:42:25.996 --> 00:42:28.918]  I'm telling you, there's no limit to evil.
[00:42:28.918 --> 00:42:42.604]  When you give in to evil, like our culture has, the worst of the evil goes to the top immediately, and that's why suddenly it's black uniforms, burning cities, mass death, slave work brigades, because to the psychopaths, that's beautiful.
[00:42:43.587 --> 00:42:51.512]  Little kids starving to death, crying in a cage, with pus coming out of their eyes, is so beautiful to the New World Order.
[00:42:51.512 --> 00:42:58.155]  You can go look up articles about decadent art you leap by, it's all dead children, maggots, dead bodies.
[00:42:58.155 --> 00:43:01.437]  Hanging in their private areas of their homes.
[00:43:01.437 --> 00:43:02.738]  Because this is who they are.
[00:43:02.738 --> 00:43:04.879]  They've come to kill.
[00:43:04.879 --> 00:43:06.120]  And they're killing everybody.
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:09.182]  You know, I was thinking about this yesterday before I go to your calls and the rest of the news.
[00:43:09.182 --> 00:43:11.023]  I'm going to cover this later in the second hour.
[00:43:12.665 --> 00:43:18.587]  About the, quote, stress vaccines that actually attack your brain so you can't feel emotion anymore.
[00:43:18.587 --> 00:43:20.088]  They're already testing these on the troops.
[00:43:20.088 --> 00:43:22.309]  They're testing all sorts of other drugs.
[00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:36.134]  And what's crazy is I went and saw a movie like the new Bourne film, the Bourne Legacy, and the whole thing beginning to end is totally accurate, exactly how things work.
[00:43:36.134 --> 00:43:39.956]  Never seen a movie like it.
[00:43:39.956 --> 00:43:40.096]  And
[00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:48.142]  What's crazy is everything in it is actually hidden in plain view, just compartmentalized.
[00:43:48.142 --> 00:43:53.904]  And we are in a softer stage of the brainwashing and chemical manipulation ourselves.
[00:43:53.904 --> 00:44:01.426]  But super soldiers, they train to be robotic and have super stamina and be able to operate two or three times longer.
[00:44:01.426 --> 00:44:03.427]  With us, we don't get the super soldier treatment.
[00:44:03.427 --> 00:44:06.988]  We get the estrogen mimickers, the toxins, the cancer viruses.
[00:44:06.988 --> 00:44:08.789]  So we're just addled and poisoned.
[00:44:08.789 --> 00:44:09.549]  So the globalist
[00:44:10.612 --> 00:44:17.077]  Can operate with different treatments and avoidance schemes they have to be healthy, while they sit there killing us.
[00:44:17.077 --> 00:44:19.418]  And even their minions aren't even part of this.
[00:44:19.418 --> 00:44:20.819]  They're compartmentalized.
[00:44:20.819 --> 00:44:32.768]  I'll tell you right now, somebody like Janet Napolitano, who's just busy all day running around, engaged in degeneracy, you know, with all her friends, she doesn't have even one half the image.
[00:44:32.768 --> 00:44:37.672]  I've run into top globalists before, and they know some of it, but they don't even know all of it, because they're lazy.
[00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:43.031]  They've been put in positions because they follow orders and don't think.
[00:44:43.031 --> 00:44:46.972]  We have reverse-engineered the whole deal.
[00:44:46.972 --> 00:44:51.434]  And we are now in the position the globalists are in, but we don't want to carry out the evil.
[00:44:51.434 --> 00:44:54.215]  We now sit in a vantage point they sit in.
[00:44:54.215 --> 00:44:55.456]  The info war does.
[00:44:55.456 --> 00:45:04.679]  And I don't think I'm even worthy to be able to bring you this info, but no one else was able to reverse-engineer it and create a platform to reach people.
[00:45:04.679 --> 00:45:08.301]  By the grace of God, we're here poised to be able to do that and be able to communicate with you right now.
[00:45:12.856 --> 00:45:18.958]  But, your food and your water that your children are eating has been weaponized.
[00:45:18.958 --> 00:45:21.059]  You are being killed.
[00:45:21.059 --> 00:45:23.059]  Look at the statistics, look at the numbers.
[00:45:23.059 --> 00:45:25.720]  The troops are being decommissioned with the suicides.
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:27.061]  It's designed that way.
[00:45:27.061 --> 00:45:29.141]  They know the drugs kill them.
[00:45:29.141 --> 00:45:30.982]  They're being decommissioned with the DU.
[00:45:30.982 --> 00:45:34.103]  Just like you decommission a cannon by spiking it.
[00:45:34.103 --> 00:45:34.683]  Letting the barrel.
[00:45:38.103 --> 00:45:39.984]  We are nothing but animals to the globalists.
[00:45:39.984 --> 00:45:50.031]  We are nothing but pure, trash, filth, chattel.
[00:45:50.031 --> 00:45:55.074]  We are absolute garbage.
[00:45:55.074 --> 00:46:04.941]  And it's a real shame that the worst of our society has got in control, who don't just not mind killing us, they enjoy it with relish.
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:12.122]  They love burning cities and children dying of deformities from DU.
[00:46:12.122 --> 00:46:16.144]  They loved 14-fold increases in deformities in the troops' children.
[00:46:16.144 --> 00:46:17.865]  This is their art.
[00:46:17.865 --> 00:46:19.525]  This is their literature.
[00:46:19.525 --> 00:46:25.388]  This is their love letter to the devil.
[00:46:25.388 --> 00:46:29.069]  You gotta work on the dark side, like Dick Cheney said.
[00:46:29.069 --> 00:46:32.831]  Well, I've seen the dark side, and it isn't a cheerleader dressed up in a
[00:46:34.315 --> 00:46:43.438]  In a devil outfit, like you see on the back of people's cars, the devil's good-looking woman, voluptuous woman, wild eyes, lust.
[00:46:43.438 --> 00:46:49.480]  No, no, God gave us life and gave us sex and gave us all the pleasures.
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:53.321]  The devil, the devil delivers destruction.
[00:46:57.418 --> 00:46:59.279]  The parable of the genie.
[00:46:59.279 --> 00:47:00.680]  You asked for the ton of gold.
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:06.023]  You better say, I want a ton of gold placed in front of me.
[00:47:06.023 --> 00:47:10.765]  Ten feet.
[00:47:10.765 --> 00:47:18.549]  Your first wish is that you can do no harm to me or not have someone else do harm to me.
[00:47:18.549 --> 00:47:24.112]  When you're doing a contract with evil, ladies and gentlemen, you never get out of it except through Christ.
[00:47:24.112 --> 00:47:25.273]  There's no winning.
[00:47:25.273 --> 00:47:26.654]  There's no outracing the devil.
[00:47:28.124 --> 00:47:31.186]  All of you that are going to serve this system will be destroyed.
[00:47:31.186 --> 00:47:35.970]  And all that you've done to the little children will come back on you many times fold.
[00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:40.433]  And I'm here to tell you, there is a heaven and there is a hell.
[00:47:40.433 --> 00:47:42.054]  And you will pay.
[00:47:42.054 --> 00:47:43.996]  You know what hell is?
[00:47:43.996 --> 00:47:49.860]  It's spiritually being cast into a dimension with people like you.
[00:47:52.406 --> 00:48:01.149]  I use the analogy of Superman 2, where they put him into that plate of glass, that dimension, fire him off into space together.
[00:48:01.149 --> 00:48:02.970]  That's what hell is.
[00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:04.290]  Hell is real.
[00:48:04.290 --> 00:48:17.275]  But let me tell you a law of the universe, even if you don't believe in heaven and hell, and all you believe in is the pain and the screams and the innocence that's music to your filthy ears, you need to understand something right now.
[00:48:17.275 --> 00:48:20.016]  You will be destroyed in this life.
[00:48:21.375 --> 00:48:29.038]  All the pain you bring to the innocents will be delivered to you many times over.
[00:48:29.038 --> 00:48:29.899]  Remember that.
[00:48:29.899 --> 00:48:33.941]  And know it well.
[00:48:33.941 --> 00:48:37.362]  Let's go ahead and take a call.
[00:48:37.362 --> 00:48:39.863]  Let's talk to Frank in North Carolina.
[00:48:39.863 --> 00:48:41.804]  You're on the air, Frank.
[00:48:41.804 --> 00:48:42.964]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[00:48:42.964 --> 00:48:45.966]  I called in several weeks ago and I apologize.
[00:48:45.966 --> 00:48:48.127]  I was a little out of it when I called.
[00:48:49.619 --> 00:48:58.131]  That Colonel Six, about Colonel Six's death, I picked that up on kind of a garbled transmission off a shortwave one night.
[00:48:58.131 --> 00:49:03.919]  Yeah, we talked about it, and I don't even really know the full story, but what's on your mind today, sir?
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:11.042]  Well, the details didn't really quite make sense to me, but apparently it was confirmed that he had died.
[00:49:11.042 --> 00:49:12.683]  But I wanted to make another suggestion.
[00:49:12.683 --> 00:49:18.905]  I had told you some years back, and I'd asked you about it recently, about the movie Shooter.
[00:49:18.905 --> 00:49:25.567]  And you stated that you had really appreciated that movie, and you thought it was the best movie of its kind, and I totally agree with that.
[00:49:25.567 --> 00:49:26.548]  Yeah, but now it isn't.
[00:49:27.628 --> 00:49:37.471]  Now, this Bourne film is incredible, because you know what, it's not just an element of the government that's doing this evil, it's the government.
[00:49:37.471 --> 00:49:40.152]  In all these movies, oh, it's a small group doing the evil.
[00:49:40.152 --> 00:49:54.215]  No, it's the whole government's involved, they're criminals at the top, they're using the soldiers like machines, and they're killing people, and they're injecting viruses into them that reprogram their brain, which is what they really do.
[00:49:54.215 --> 00:49:56.216]  I mean, this film is highly classified.
[00:49:56.796 --> 00:50:01.638]  It took me a decade to reverse engineer what they're doing and this film is real.
[00:50:01.638 --> 00:50:06.000]  That film is a fictional account of real stuff they're doing.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:06.741]  I was blown away.
[00:50:06.741 --> 00:50:07.021]  Go ahead.
[00:50:07.904 --> 00:50:09.485]  Okay, well, a blast from the past.
[00:50:09.485 --> 00:50:22.571]  If you liked The Shooter, and I wasn't going to go and see the newborn movie, but I probably will now based on your recommendation, but there's a Cold War version of The Shooter, a very similar type movie.
[00:50:22.571 --> 00:50:26.153]  It's with Gene Hackman and Tommy Lee Jones from 1989.
[00:50:26.153 --> 00:50:27.834]  It's called The Package.
[00:50:28.494 --> 00:50:29.795]  I gotta see it!
[00:50:29.795 --> 00:50:30.395]  Absolutely!
[00:50:56.676 --> 00:50:58.656]  Again, and these films are exactly how they do it.
[00:51:18.581 --> 00:51:20.102]  Blowing up your food prices.
[00:51:20.102 --> 00:51:27.747]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoodsDirect now.
[00:51:27.747 --> 00:51:31.610]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:33.411]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[00:51:33.411 --> 00:51:37.434]  I recently increased my supply from eFoodsDirect because we've all known this was coming.
[00:51:37.434 --> 00:51:40.036]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[00:51:40.316 --> 00:51:43.097]  The fact is, you can eat it any time to save money today.
[00:51:43.097 --> 00:51:47.659]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[00:51:47.659 --> 00:51:48.320]  Don't wait!
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:50.201]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.

[00:52:30.852 --> 00:52:35.415]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:52:35.415 --> 00:52:41.219]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:52:41.219 --> 00:52:44.861]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:54:06.981 --> 00:54:12.585]  Well, I'm not the kind to kiss and tell, but I've been seen with Farrah.
[00:54:12.585 --> 00:54:18.088]  I've never been with anything less than a dime, so fine.
[00:54:18.088 --> 00:54:23.491]  I've been on fire with Sally Field, gone fast with a girl named Bo.
[00:54:23.491 --> 00:54:27.054]  But somehow they just don't end up as mine.
[00:54:28.806 --> 00:54:29.807]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:54:29.807 --> 00:54:30.407]  to 2 p.m.
[00:54:30.407 --> 00:54:35.150]  Central, we are here live, back 7 o'clock Central, at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:36.130]  Here's what I'm gonna do.
[00:54:36.130 --> 00:54:38.672]  I'm gonna get into military suicides.
[00:54:57.970 --> 00:55:02.971]  And how it ties into mind control at the bottom of the next hour, because I want to just start going through your calls.
[00:55:02.971 --> 00:55:03.592]  800-259-9231.
[00:55:03.592 --> 00:55:08.453]  We don't screen your calls, so it's always all over the map.
[00:55:08.453 --> 00:55:10.414]  Never know what you're going to hear next.
[00:55:10.414 --> 00:55:15.455]  And yeah, I got about 15 stacks of giant news here we'll be going over as well.
[00:55:15.455 --> 00:55:21.977]  Like slave bracelets for the children that monitor them medically and monitor their minds when they're in school.
[00:55:22.987 --> 00:55:24.428]  You think the government's out of control?
[00:55:24.428 --> 00:55:25.830]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:55:25.830 --> 00:55:29.353]  TSA now hitting the streets at campaign events.
[00:55:29.353 --> 00:55:32.176]  Let's go ahead and talk to Scott in Arizona.
[00:55:32.176 --> 00:55:34.338]  You're on the air, sir.
[00:55:34.338 --> 00:55:34.938]  Hey, Alex.
[00:55:34.938 --> 00:55:36.320]  Yeah, it was...
[00:55:37.518 --> 00:55:44.822]  And Wickenburg here this morning, working out of Wickenburg, which, uh, for people that don't know where Wickenburg is, it's between, uh, Phoenix and Las Vegas.
[00:55:44.822 --> 00:55:48.364]  It's on your way to Las Vegas, or vice versa.
[00:55:48.364 --> 00:55:57.329]  Anyway, um, they have a little, uh, off the 93 Highway, they have a little, uh, um, convenience store where it has a jack-in-the-box inside of it.
[00:55:57.329 --> 00:56:03.572]  And, uh, I walked in there to, you know, get some breakfast this morning, and I see, uh, I thought it was a cop, but
[00:56:04.290 --> 00:56:08.833]  Um, as I got, you know, closer view of him, it was a TSA guy.
[00:56:08.833 --> 00:56:12.014]  It said Transportation Security.
[00:56:12.014 --> 00:56:16.177]  And, uh, you know, everything else looked just like a cop dark blue outfit.
[00:56:16.177 --> 00:56:20.979]  And, uh, he was ordering a big breakfast for everybody on the bus, which I didn't see when I pulled in.
[00:56:20.979 --> 00:56:21.640]  It was on the side.
[00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:22.720]  We're good to go.
[00:56:44.728 --> 00:56:48.351]  Authoritarian governments always want to create their own police force.
[00:56:48.351 --> 00:56:50.292]  They can put criminals and people in.
[00:56:50.292 --> 00:56:52.354]  Stalin, Hitler, Mao, they all did it.
[00:56:52.354 --> 00:56:54.455]  And now they're everywhere and they're going to pull you.
[00:56:54.455 --> 00:56:58.298]  I mean, you think you're not going to fly and not have convicted pedos grab your children?
[00:56:58.298 --> 00:57:03.742]  Listen, they're coming to the highways and they're going to have police standing by to machine gun you with armored checkpoints.
[00:57:03.742 --> 00:57:06.044]  They're going to take your wife to a rape room.
[00:57:06.044 --> 00:57:07.205]  It's freedom.
[00:57:07.205 --> 00:57:08.626]  Al Qaeda may be hiding in there.
[00:57:08.626 --> 00:57:09.667]  I mean, it's just sick.
[00:57:09.667 --> 00:57:10.808]  It's total sickness.
[00:57:11.608 --> 00:57:14.792]  I would have loved to, man, I tell you what, I've just had enough.
[00:57:14.792 --> 00:57:17.776]  Had enough of this filthy, murdering, foreign, occupational government.
[00:57:17.776 --> 00:57:18.397]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:57:19.529 --> 00:57:23.630]  Oh yeah, he did say one thing to me, like I said, when I thought I was talking to a cop first.
[00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:25.531]  When he did say that, he goes, it's job security.
[00:57:25.531 --> 00:57:33.874]  So it seems like they're just getting people that are, like you said, you know, to just pick anybody up that will do this job, that's hurting for a job right now, and trying to make ends meet.
[00:57:33.874 --> 00:57:45.778]  Yeah, I know, they implode the economy, and then all you get is government jobs, but the more cops they hire, none of them can do actual real police work, because they're out writing tickets, because they tell them that funds their job when it all goes offshore to megabanks.
[00:57:46.038 --> 00:57:48.099]  We're conquered by foreign banks!
[00:57:48.099 --> 00:57:49.519]  They publicly brag!
[00:57:49.519 --> 00:57:51.620]  They put cancer viruses in our shots!
[00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:54.441]  You idiot TSA people!
[00:57:54.441 --> 00:58:00.923]  And then they get to write articles about how I'm an extremist because I'm mad about it when Harvard admits the fluoride's killing us.
[00:58:00.923 --> 00:58:03.604]  They're putting bug poison in the stinking water supply!
[00:58:03.604 --> 00:58:05.205]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[00:58:08.459 --> 00:58:09.900]  We're gonna go break and come back and take calls.
[00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:11.041]  I'm gonna try to not get angry here.
[00:58:11.041 --> 00:58:12.021]  I'm just sick of it.
[00:58:12.021 --> 00:58:13.302]  I'm sick of it!
[00:58:13.302 --> 00:58:19.746]  I'm looking at these photos and stuff of TSA at Paul Ryan events out on the street in front of it searching people.
[00:58:19.746 --> 00:58:23.488]  Just keep your hands off of me!
[00:58:23.488 --> 00:58:28.291]  Your bosses staged the underwear bombing and got caught doing it for heaven's sakes.
[00:58:28.291 --> 00:58:31.693]  It came out on C-SPAN.
[00:58:31.693 --> 00:58:36.696]  The government is run by foreign murdering, child kidnapping, narcotics trafficking killers!
[00:58:43.072 --> 00:58:47.018]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.353 --> 00:58:55.857]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[00:58:55.857 --> 00:58:58.279]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:58:58.279 --> 00:59:07.385]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure, and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:59:07.385 --> 00:59:10.828]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.

[00:59:14.790 --> 00:59:17.292]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[00:59:18.373 --> 00:59:19.874]  Easy to set up and use.
[00:59:19.874 --> 00:59:21.295]  Doesn't require electricity.
[00:59:21.295 --> 00:59:24.458]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:59:24.458 --> 00:59:27.840]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:31.983]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:59:31.983 --> 00:59:34.725]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:59:34.725 --> 00:59:36.306]  It's what my family uses.
[00:59:36.306 --> 00:59:39.609]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.

[00:59:46.774 --> 00:59:47.455]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:47.455 --> 00:59:49.136]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.151 --> 01:00:09.992]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.992 --> 01:00:11.573]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.573 --> 01:00:13.113]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.113 --> 01:00:17.315]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.315 --> 01:00:21.356]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.412 --> 01:00:26.993]  Well, even mainstream media admits the war with Iran is on the fast track.
[01:00:26.993 --> 01:00:28.094]  Doesn't mean we can't stop it.
[01:00:28.094 --> 01:00:28.754]  That's coming up.
[01:00:28.754 --> 01:00:30.814]  Economic news, your phone calls.
[01:00:30.814 --> 01:00:34.575]  I'm going to break down exactly why the troops are committing suicide en masse.
[01:00:34.575 --> 01:00:37.916]  It's a cocktail of issues, but I'm going to do that at the bottom of the hour.
[01:00:37.916 --> 01:00:44.458]  Tie it in to these viral vaccines that are really nanotech reprogrammer systems.
[01:00:44.458 --> 01:00:47.439]  Let's go ahead and go back to your calls right now.
[01:00:47.439 --> 01:00:49.199]  Colin in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:00:49.199 --> 01:00:50.660]  Welcome.
[01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:51.140]  Hey, brother.
[01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:51.560]  How's it going?
[01:00:52.389 --> 01:00:54.270]  It's going, I guess, pretty darn good.
[01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:55.650]  Everything's going to hell in a handbasket.
[01:00:55.650 --> 01:00:56.130]  It's wonderful.
[01:00:56.130 --> 01:01:00.012]  We're still free for a little while though, so let's live it up.
[01:01:00.012 --> 01:01:04.013]  Yeah, well I'm free right now to recognize a bunch of murdering criminals when I see it.
[01:01:04.013 --> 01:01:06.394]  Their mind control doesn't work on me, I'll tell you that right now.
[01:01:07.395 --> 01:01:13.500]  Me neither brother, but unfortunately what I'm seeing around now everywhere is just sheeple.
[01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:16.122]  I try to talk to people every day.
[01:01:16.122 --> 01:01:22.667]  I've called in a bunch and I just have a little suggestion for you since you got this magazine going out now and the nightly news.
[01:01:22.667 --> 01:01:24.208]  Maybe y'all should have a kind of like a
[01:01:24.808 --> 01:01:27.951]  How to talk to the sheeple section, you know?
[01:01:27.951 --> 01:01:31.854]  Telling people, you know, you're the best at waking up people in the world, Alex.
[01:01:31.854 --> 01:01:34.396]  You do it every day, so you probably don't think about that much.
[01:01:34.396 --> 01:01:36.778]  Well, I think the key is getting real.
[01:01:36.778 --> 01:01:42.182]  You know, we had that top lawyer in here, Wesley Snipes' lawyer, and he's gotten a lot of other people off.
[01:01:42.182 --> 01:01:43.943]  I mean, Snipes went to jail for the...
[01:01:44.864 --> 01:01:48.387]  Silly angle of misdemeanors, but the big felonies were defeated.
[01:01:48.387 --> 01:01:51.150]  Very rare to be able to win something like that with the case they had.
[01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:57.676]  And he said, no, the key is attacking and being in the face and shaking people out of their complacency.
[01:01:57.676 --> 01:02:00.078]  People are in a medical trance, sir.
[01:02:01.030 --> 01:02:08.574]  Shelby, so if you come up and try to go, oh hi, oh, you know, I know this sounds kooky, but did you know there's a, you're like, hey, things are getting ready to collapse.
[01:02:08.574 --> 01:02:09.474]  It's engineered.
[01:02:09.474 --> 01:02:11.575]  We've been taken over by foreign banks.
[01:02:11.575 --> 01:02:13.997]  Read this article in InfoWars magazine.
[01:02:13.997 --> 01:02:18.679]  Here, have a copy where it's got links to the bankers bragging that they've captured America.
[01:02:18.679 --> 01:02:20.960]  Did you know foreign banks said they've captured America?
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:22.661]  And then if they say, okay, what are you going to do about it?
[01:02:22.901 --> 01:02:24.842]  We'll say, well, hey, we better do something about it.
[01:02:24.842 --> 01:02:26.363]  And then realize, go listen.
[01:02:26.363 --> 01:02:29.125]  I know you're not going to listen now because you don't feel good about yourself.
[01:02:29.125 --> 01:02:30.386]  You think you're powerless.
[01:02:30.386 --> 01:02:40.152]  But down the road when stuff really gets bad, kind of grab them like with a Vulcan deal and say on the shoulder, I mean, I'm saying figuratively, but get them and say, listen, brother or sister.
[01:02:41.673 --> 01:02:45.219]  As things get a lot worse, remember what I said to you.
[01:02:45.219 --> 01:02:47.022]  Remember.
[01:02:47.022 --> 01:02:50.467]  And so many times a year or two down the road, they're going to activate.
[01:02:50.467 --> 01:02:53.231]  But look, the world's always had a lot of sheeple.
[01:02:54.369 --> 01:02:57.230]  They are always going to sit there and suck their thumb.
[01:02:57.230 --> 01:03:03.671]  We're dealing with a very small cadre of global criminals that manipulate their minions through compartmentalization and need to know.
[01:03:03.671 --> 01:03:06.392]  We have the data dump from the top.
[01:03:06.392 --> 01:03:09.413]  So the best people to target is people in the system.
[01:03:09.413 --> 01:03:11.793]  Because they'll, I actually found they're the easiest to wake up.
[01:03:11.793 --> 01:03:13.894]  Because when you give them this stuff, they go, that makes perfect sense.
[01:03:13.894 --> 01:03:14.754]  It never made sense.
[01:03:14.754 --> 01:03:15.574]  How do you know all this?
[01:03:15.574 --> 01:03:16.775]  Well, that's true what you're saying there.
[01:03:16.775 --> 01:03:18.055]  It's like, yeah, because
[01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:20.197]  You know, I'm here for the rebellion.
[01:03:20.197 --> 01:03:21.118]  I'm here to help.
[01:03:21.118 --> 01:03:23.841]  You know, come on, join us.
[01:03:23.841 --> 01:03:28.567]  We need to get past this fighting with people and say, do you know you work for a bunch of pedophile scum?
[01:03:28.567 --> 01:03:29.448]  Here's some proof.
[01:03:29.448 --> 01:03:30.990]  OK, well, you don't like doing that, do you?
[01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:32.592]  Well, wake up and at least know they're the enemy.
[01:03:33.393 --> 01:03:37.456]  You see, you've just got to, just over the top, because reality is over the top.
[01:03:37.456 --> 01:03:39.477]  Reality is over the top.
[01:03:39.477 --> 01:03:41.779]  What's, sir, I go back to this.
[01:03:41.779 --> 01:03:44.381]  I only say this a lot because people pay attention to Harvard.
[01:03:44.381 --> 01:03:46.242]  There's thousands of studies, thousands.
[01:03:46.242 --> 01:03:53.707]  Harvard came out and said, in a big study, we've reviewed dozens of studies from 1976 to 2011, and it's conclusive.
[01:03:53.707 --> 01:03:57.770]  Massive cancer increases and IQ reduction in every city, fluoridating.
[01:03:57.770 --> 01:03:59.451]  It's deadly poison.
[01:03:59.451 --> 01:04:01.413]  We recommend it be taken out.
[01:04:01.413 --> 01:04:02.914]  Why would even Harvard do that?
[01:04:04.195 --> 01:04:07.117]  Because they got brain damaged kids now!
[01:04:07.117 --> 01:04:08.518]  They got family dying!
[01:04:08.518 --> 01:04:13.722]  The average idiot working for the system, even at the dean level, is not a globalist operative!
[01:04:14.781 --> 01:04:26.990]  Oh, they've been told there's global governance to help the poor, and yeah, we are going to reduce population because it's for the Earth, but we're kind of sweetie, and you're going to be part of the winning team, and then their 12-year-old gets diagnosed with bone cancer.
[01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:29.311]  And then they find out that bone cancer is off the chart.
[01:04:29.311 --> 01:04:34.535]  And then they find out, and then they bury their kid, or they cremate them, and then that gets them to get into religion.
[01:04:34.795 --> 01:04:37.077]  Real quick, and find out why I'm so angry!
[01:04:37.077 --> 01:04:44.364]  Because I don't like watching a bunch of scumbag foreign crazy bankers full of a bunch of bravado and hubris poisoning us!
[01:04:44.364 --> 01:04:45.786]  I'm here to wake people up!
[01:04:45.786 --> 01:04:47.327]  I'm here to break the conditioning!
[01:04:47.327 --> 01:04:49.089]  I'm here for the wake-up call!
[01:04:49.089 --> 01:04:53.073]  It's time to COME ALIVE!
[01:04:53.073 --> 01:04:54.034]  We'll be back!
[01:04:54.034 --> 01:04:54.955]  Stay with us!
[01:04:54.955 --> 01:04:56.816]  The resistance starts now!
[01:04:56.816 --> 01:04:57.817]  It starts with you!
[01:05:00.711 --> 01:05:02.031]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:02.031 --> 01:05:07.613]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:05:07.613 --> 01:05:12.635]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:05:12.635 --> 01:05:13.095]  It's true.
[01:05:13.095 --> 01:05:17.657]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:05:18.197 --> 01:05:23.419]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:05:23.419 --> 01:05:25.740]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:30.543]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:05:30.543 --> 01:05:31.663]  And here's the best part.
[01:05:31.663 --> 01:05:34.724]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:05:34.724 --> 01:05:38.006]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:05:38.326 --> 01:05:41.527]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:05:41.527 --> 01:05:43.748]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:05:43.748 --> 01:05:44.688]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:05:44.688 --> 01:05:45.088]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:05:45.088 --> 01:05:48.329]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:05:48.329 --> 01:05:50.070]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:06.518]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[01:06:06.518 --> 01:06:09.480]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:14.864]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[01:06:14.864 --> 01:06:19.547]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[01:06:19.827 --> 01:06:27.475]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods Direct now.
[01:06:27.475 --> 01:06:31.360]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:33.142]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[01:06:33.142 --> 01:06:37.166]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[01:06:37.166 --> 01:06:39.769]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[01:06:40.049 --> 01:06:42.830]  The fact is, you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[01:06:42.830 --> 01:06:47.392]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[01:06:47.392 --> 01:06:48.032]  Don't wait!
[01:06:48.032 --> 01:06:49.933]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:06:49.933 --> 01:06:51.514]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:06:51.514 --> 01:06:53.034]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:04.084]  Supernatural silver is not an ionic or a colloidal silver.
[01:07:04.084 --> 01:07:09.689]  It is a nanocatalytic silver cell technology with superior benefits to the colloidal silvers of yesterday.
[01:07:09.689 --> 01:07:13.373]  This new molecular structure is permanently bonded to water.
[01:07:13.373 --> 01:07:19.700]  It is the only water-soluble silver that is 99% bioavailable and non-toxic with no known side effects.
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:28.189]  Silversaw's patented technology has advanced antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties with a 15-year shelf life.
[01:07:28.189 --> 01:07:34.335]  It can be used internally as well as topically and is one of the most important items needed in any emergency.
[01:07:34.335 --> 01:07:41.083]  Independent testing from universities, hospitals, military, and private labs make this the most proven product in the industry.
[01:07:41.483 --> 01:07:44.023]  No silver solution is better or safer.
[01:07:44.023 --> 01:07:46.944]  Protect yourself and your loved ones and be prepared.

[01:07:57.946 --> 01:08:07.188]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:26.007 --> 01:08:29.451]  Alright, we are continuing with your phone calls and at the bottom of the hour...
[01:08:30.572 --> 01:08:38.014]  We're going to look at why the troops are really committing suicide at record numbers, seven to eight times any previous record.
[01:08:38.014 --> 01:08:42.255]  We'll also look at national news, geopolitical news, huge news in the Middle East.
[01:08:42.255 --> 01:08:45.476]  It is all coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:08:45.476 --> 01:08:51.458]  But right now, I want to continue with your phone calls here today.
[01:08:51.458 --> 01:08:54.679]  Let's talk to Michael in Tennessee.
[01:08:54.679 --> 01:08:55.499]  You're on the air.
[01:08:55.499 --> 01:08:57.139]  Welcome.
[01:08:57.139 --> 01:08:57.580]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[01:08:57.580 --> 01:08:58.520]  How are you today, sir?
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:08:59.060]  I'm pretty good.
[01:09:00.151 --> 01:09:01.173]  Thank you for having my call.
[01:09:01.173 --> 01:09:02.134]  It's the first time caller.
[01:09:02.134 --> 01:09:03.696]  You don't have to thank me, man.
[01:09:03.696 --> 01:09:10.567]  Most of these talk shows make you grovel and beg and go through call screening and where some control freak tries to make sure you agree with their agenda.
[01:09:10.567 --> 01:09:12.209]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:09:12.209 --> 01:09:13.751]  Hit me and hit me hard with info.
[01:09:14.938 --> 01:09:17.159]  Okay, well I don't have any new information for you.
[01:09:17.159 --> 01:09:21.620]  I just wanted to applaud your efforts of your new print campaign.
[01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:26.921]  I think that's a really great idea and I think it's amazing that it's going to be revitalized in this country.
[01:09:26.921 --> 01:09:33.003]  I would call for people at the local level to, especially on college campuses,
[01:09:36.306 --> 01:09:39.048]  Yeah, well, you got your point in before your phone died.
[01:09:39.048 --> 01:09:40.249]  Thank you, Michael, in Tennessee.
[01:09:40.249 --> 01:09:41.950]  And if you just joined us, we printed 70,000 copies.
[01:09:41.950 --> 01:09:43.411]  50,000 copies hit the streets of Austin.
[01:09:43.411 --> 01:09:46.352]  In less than 24 hours, we sold all of the 20,000 copies that we had.
[01:09:52.898 --> 01:09:53.639]  The extras.
[01:09:53.639 --> 01:09:55.041]  They all sold.
[01:09:55.041 --> 01:10:01.308]  So I just put an order in and they're going to print them today because they still happen to have the press set up for it miraculously.
[01:10:01.308 --> 01:10:09.018]  I saved us a bunch of money to print 20,000 more of the bad boy.
[01:10:09.018 --> 01:10:09.779]  So we're going to be
[01:10:12.028 --> 01:10:17.790]  Printing those today, we will have those tomorrow, and we're printing 20,000, and that's it, it'll be a sold-out edition.
[01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:19.771]  So that'll be 90,000 total.
[01:10:19.771 --> 01:10:25.634]  Our advertisers paid to be at 70,000, but they're gonna be in a 90,000.
[01:10:25.634 --> 01:10:28.995]  And it is powerful, it is free for everybody.
[01:10:28.995 --> 01:10:33.497]  An e-copy that you can flip through like a regular magazine, click on the website links, it's gonna work.
[01:10:33.497 --> 01:10:38.539]  InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:10:38.539 --> 01:10:40.980]  Put in your email, and we're gonna send it out at two o'clock.
[01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:47.307]  Today, on two different platforms, depending on which type of computer you have, but it looks just like a regular page.
[01:10:47.307 --> 01:10:49.189]  It bends and folds like a page.
[01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:50.891]  You can click on the links.
[01:10:50.891 --> 01:10:53.455]  In the future, we could even have videos embedded in it.
[01:10:53.455 --> 01:10:56.759]  That's pretty amazing, the systems we've signed up that we're using.
[01:10:56.759 --> 01:11:00.143]  So, InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:11:01.624 --> 01:11:05.271]  Or if you missed that URL, just the right hand side says sign up for Alex Jones's newsletter.
[01:11:05.271 --> 01:11:09.339]  It's got my picture up there and a lot more, not just the magazine, monthly will be sent to you free.
[01:11:09.339 --> 01:11:12.044]  If you want to buy them in bulk, InfoWars.com.
[01:11:13.832 --> 01:11:17.115]  Shop.com or InfowarsStore.com will get you there.
[01:11:17.115 --> 01:11:18.196]  You can't miss it.
[01:11:18.196 --> 01:11:25.782]  You can buy them at cost, at cost, at InfowarsShop.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:11:25.782 --> 01:11:36.910]  And it's free on the street, but I think next issue we'll take the free off just so people that want to sell them in their grocery stores, in their gas stations, in their businesses can sell them.
[01:11:37.891 --> 01:11:44.895]  Uh, you know, for, it cost us about 50 cents after printing and shipping it to us from the printer outside Austin.
[01:11:44.895 --> 01:11:46.196]  Right at about 50 cents a piece.
[01:11:46.196 --> 01:11:48.438]  I suggest you sell them for about a dollar a piece.
[01:11:48.438 --> 01:11:49.578]  After all, we're not communists.
[01:11:49.578 --> 01:11:50.039]  You should, uh...
[01:11:51.238 --> 01:11:56.383]  We've had a bunch of requests for the racks at SaganFullWars.com that cost us like $40.
[01:11:56.383 --> 01:11:58.585]  They're nice racks.
[01:11:58.585 --> 01:12:00.947]  We're going to look for a place that's less expensive.
[01:12:00.947 --> 01:12:07.653]  So we're going to try to do a deal where you can buy racks if you want them for $50 to put in your business as well.
[01:12:07.653 --> 01:12:08.994]  So there you go.
[01:12:08.994 --> 01:12:11.316]  It's already exploding a lot faster than I thought it would.
[01:12:11.316 --> 01:12:15.800]  Soon we'll put up a website and stuff for people that want to franchise it into their city.
[01:12:17.264 --> 01:12:18.224]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my calls.
[01:12:18.224 --> 01:12:18.784]  Long time listener.
[01:12:18.784 --> 01:12:20.004]  First time caller.
[01:12:48.010 --> 01:12:48.851]  Welcome.
[01:12:48.851 --> 01:12:53.758]  For one, I would just like to thank you for jumping on Brandon Robb's story.
[01:12:53.758 --> 01:12:58.865]  That, to me, is the beginning of the end of America as we know it.
[01:12:59.670 --> 01:13:01.110]  What is your take on that, sir?
[01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:05.872]  Well, you've got talk show host confirmed arrested for saying there's going to be a collapse.
[01:13:05.872 --> 01:13:07.432]  He's buying guns to protect himself.
[01:13:07.432 --> 01:13:09.433]  Had that fellow on yesterday.
[01:13:09.433 --> 01:13:13.654]  And then supporters fear Marine being disappeared.
[01:13:13.654 --> 01:13:15.514]  That's Brandon Robb.
[01:13:15.514 --> 01:13:19.756]  And his Facebook stuff is like, yeah, you know, the globalists have taken over.
[01:13:19.756 --> 01:13:20.496]  They staged 9-11.
[01:13:20.496 --> 01:13:23.857]  You know, there's going to be a revolution against these criminals.
[01:13:23.857 --> 01:13:24.517]  Everything I say
[01:13:25.197 --> 01:13:26.438]  I bet money he's a listener.
[01:13:26.438 --> 01:13:31.901]  And they went and psychiatric group grabbed him and his family videotaped him being drug off.
[01:13:31.901 --> 01:13:34.563]  But by the way, they didn't call on him.
[01:13:34.563 --> 01:13:36.884]  So it's not like the family says he's going crazy.
[01:13:36.884 --> 01:13:42.068]  And so that's the new thing is that you and now they've moved him and three hours away.
[01:13:42.068 --> 01:13:45.990]  And so this is the new people are going to the FEMA camps.
[01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:52.915]  I mean, they're you know, they they went and grabbed this pretty popular talk show host that we've had an article about yesterday that
[01:13:55.490 --> 01:14:09.324]  The Northeast Intelligence Group wrote a story about where they came out to his house with no warrant, no nothing, tricked him into coming outside, grabbed him and said you're being involuntarily committed, and threw him in a mental institution until he agreed to sign papers to give his guns up.
[01:14:09.324 --> 01:14:11.586]  So that's the new thing.
[01:14:11.586 --> 01:14:19.393]  And if they come and grab you, the problem is now, they did this to a lot of famous writers and people, like Hemingway.
[01:14:20.482 --> 01:14:22.684]  He said the FBI was spying on him, harassing him.
[01:14:22.684 --> 01:14:24.585]  Of course, it was later declassified they were.
[01:14:24.585 --> 01:14:27.668]  They said that was mentally ill, because the FBI wouldn't do that in America.
[01:14:27.668 --> 01:14:31.691]  So they grabbed him, electroshock-therapied him for about six months, so he didn't know who he was.
[01:14:31.691 --> 01:14:34.573]  And he was so depressed about it, they say he committed suicide.
[01:14:34.573 --> 01:14:41.379]  So, you know, they can grab me, electroshock me six months, put me on antipsychotics, brain damage me, release me out.
[01:14:41.379 --> 01:14:42.259]  And that's how they roll.
[01:14:42.259 --> 01:14:45.262]  And this is a criminal group of child-kidnapping murderers that run our country.
[01:14:46.185 --> 01:14:51.131]  Type in UN, NATO, Defense Department, child kidnapping.
[01:14:51.131 --> 01:14:56.636]  It's BBC, AP, Reuters, and they just grab the kids, run them out to slave pits all over the world, and that's the way it is.
[01:14:56.636 --> 01:15:02.182]  I mean, pure, demonic, murdering scum that see us as absolute animals run the country.
[01:15:02.182 --> 01:15:02.683]  Anything else, sir?
[01:15:04.199 --> 01:15:20.244]  Uh, yeah, I just wanted, Fox did a, finally it got on mainstream media like four days later, but Fox did a little thing on it and they quoted the one of the things that he said, I'm ready to, I'm sharpening my axe, I'm ready to sever heads.
[01:15:20.244 --> 01:15:24.985]  But when they did that, they never said that that was actually song lyrics.
[01:15:24.985 --> 01:15:28.746]  Um, they just said that he said that, but they were actually song lyrics because I,
[01:15:29.326 --> 01:15:29.846]  No, no, no.
[01:15:29.846 --> 01:15:33.627]  Well, listen, they could take what I'm saying if I said, you know what?
[01:15:33.627 --> 01:15:36.148]  We're going to blow the competition away.
[01:15:36.148 --> 01:15:37.668]  And then, oh, you're going to blow somebody up.
[01:15:37.668 --> 01:15:39.529]  No, it's a figure of speech.
[01:15:39.529 --> 01:15:41.369]  And it's all part of the new thought crime.
[01:15:41.369 --> 01:15:42.930]  They want to intimidate us.
[01:15:42.930 --> 01:15:49.091]  They want to keep us down, demonize us, the police, and then march the police in against us to start a civil war.
[01:15:49.091 --> 01:15:50.312]  But I got news for The Globalist.
[01:15:50.312 --> 01:15:52.352]  I talked to a lot of police, some of my sources.
[01:15:52.352 --> 01:15:54.873]  The police have never woken up like this.
[01:15:54.873 --> 01:15:57.974]  It is miraculous what's happening.
[01:15:59.719 --> 01:16:01.585]  Self-preservation will do that to you, by the way.
[01:16:01.585 --> 01:16:03.169]  The police aren't stupid at the end of the day.
[01:16:03.169 --> 01:16:07.381]  They know a civil war of the American people is not going to go well.
[01:16:09.938 --> 01:16:17.964]  I'd like to thank you for what you're doing, and one last thing is if they ever tried to take you, it'd probably be the worst thing.
[01:16:17.964 --> 01:16:21.387]  I mean, I know this Brandon Robb thing is... Well, maybe they want that, though.
[01:16:21.387 --> 01:16:26.611]  I mean, listen, I don't ever lie to myself and tell them they won't shoot me or kill me or set me up tomorrow.
[01:16:26.611 --> 01:16:29.253]  I just put it in God's hands, and whatever happens, it's in God's hands.
[01:16:29.853 --> 01:16:31.694]  I appreciate your call, good to hear from you.
[01:16:31.694 --> 01:16:34.175]  Yeah, supporters fear Facebook Marine being disappeared.
[01:16:34.175 --> 01:16:41.258]  Brandon Robb forcibly transferred to psychiatric facility three hours away from legal team and family.
[01:16:41.258 --> 01:16:45.720]  The man kidnapped by police and committed to mental institution for his political post on Facebook.
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:55.084]  Fear the former Marine is being disappeared by authorities, our new masters, after he was forcibly transferred to psychiatric facility more than three hours away from his family and legal team.
[01:16:56.511 --> 01:17:07.994]  And former veteran of foreign wars, who they say is the number one enemy, in Afghanistan and Iraq, was involuntarily detained for psychiatric questioning last week by our loving globalist.
[01:17:07.994 --> 01:17:17.636]  In Virginia's Chesterfield, Virginia, leaving anti-establishment messages on Facebook, which question the official story behind 9-11 and referring to corruption within the U.S.
[01:17:17.636 --> 01:17:18.336]  government.
[01:17:18.336 --> 01:17:20.937]  The FBI claims Rob's posts were terrorist in nature.
[01:17:20.937 --> 01:17:21.437]  That's a quote.
[01:17:22.452 --> 01:17:32.216]  He's being held against his will by not being charged with any crime under the state law that allows people to be temporarily committed for a period of 30 days.
[01:17:32.216 --> 01:17:36.577]  By the time they've ended up drugging him out, they'll get whatever they want.
[01:17:36.577 --> 01:17:37.518]  That's what criminals do.
[01:17:37.518 --> 01:17:42.520]  It's all about controlling everything and ganging up and winning against good people.
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:50.423]  He's being transferred to the John Randolph Psychiatric Mental Hospital in Hopewell, the veterans hospital in Salem, Virginia, on the other side of the state.
[01:17:51.837 --> 01:17:52.998]  Well, that's bad.
[01:17:52.998 --> 01:17:54.039]  So, uh, there you go.
[01:17:54.039 --> 01:17:55.300]  Infowars.com.
[01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:57.982]  You want to read that?
[01:17:57.982 --> 01:17:59.283]  A lot of veterans I know.
[01:17:59.283 --> 01:18:02.285]  I know a former famous UT football player is a veteran.
[01:18:03.516 --> 01:18:04.936]  No criminal record.
[01:18:04.936 --> 01:18:11.558]  And he literally did the textbook thing, went to buy his grandson a .22 rifle, and they said, sorry, you've been denied.
[01:18:11.558 --> 01:18:17.119]  And he did request, and they said, well, we're just saying in Vietnam, you might have had some problems.
[01:18:17.119 --> 01:18:18.399]  I never had post-traumatic stress.
[01:18:18.399 --> 01:18:19.439]  You don't get guns anymore.
[01:18:19.439 --> 01:18:20.499]  No judge, no jury.
[01:18:20.499 --> 01:18:21.739]  Shut up, scum!
[01:18:21.739 --> 01:18:23.360]  We work for foreign banks!
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:24.120]  Ha ha ha!
[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:26.340]  But there is no global government, even though we're announcing it.
[01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:26.760]  Ha ha ha!
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:28.081]  Because you're mentally ill.
[01:18:28.081 --> 01:18:29.801]  Craig in Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[01:18:29.801 --> 01:18:30.121]  Welcome.
[01:18:31.684 --> 01:18:32.865]  Well, thank you, Mr. Jones.
[01:18:32.865 --> 01:18:39.651]  Big howdy from across the Red River, and I had wanted to call you today, and maybe you could help me.
[01:18:39.651 --> 01:18:45.116]  I just don't understand, for instance, where are the gentry?
[01:18:45.116 --> 01:18:46.757]  Why aren't they waking up?
[01:18:46.757 --> 01:18:47.538]  You know?
[01:18:47.538 --> 01:18:50.901]  Now, my father is starting to wake up.
[01:18:50.901 --> 01:18:57.847]  I think I've gotten convinced to take all of the family money out of the banks and put it into gold.
[01:18:57.847 --> 01:18:58.848]  But, you know, I started
[01:19:00.095 --> 01:19:08.719]  Following you and posting concerning, you know, us equipping Al-Qaeda in Libya and in Syria, and people thought I was crazy.
[01:19:08.719 --> 01:19:17.322]  You know, and I stumbled across, I didn't even see this, but in February, the BBC Middle East had a video.
[01:19:17.322 --> 01:19:18.182]  It's on there now.
[01:19:18.182 --> 01:19:25.045]  They even wear Al-Qaeda uniforms, NATO helicopters landing, dumping out black uniformed Al-Qaeda with Al-Qaeda flags.
[01:19:26.118 --> 01:19:27.299]  Stay there, I'm going to come back to you.
[01:19:27.299 --> 01:19:35.102]  But yes, the CFR website, LA Times, all of them admit for over a year with Libya, now in Syria, Al-Qaeda is the main force.
[01:19:35.102 --> 01:19:39.364]  The quote from the CFR is, we need Al-Qaeda, America.
[01:19:39.364 --> 01:19:40.784]  America doesn't exist.
[01:19:40.784 --> 01:19:42.805]  We were taken over by foreign banks.
[01:19:42.805 --> 01:19:50.349]  The only way freedom comes back and America comes back is if we realize the tyrants wrapped their takeover in the American flag.
[01:19:50.349 --> 01:19:51.809]  We were infiltrated.
[01:19:51.809 --> 01:19:52.850]  We were taken over.
[01:19:54.406 --> 01:19:58.447]  And yes, the criminals that run our government are Al-Qaeda!
[01:19:58.447 --> 01:20:02.229]  They are Al-Qaeda!
[01:20:02.229 --> 01:20:08.411]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid, and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[01:20:08.411 --> 01:20:13.513]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[01:20:13.513 --> 01:20:15.693]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[01:20:15.693 --> 01:20:22.996]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[01:20:23.496 --> 01:20:27.199]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[01:20:27.199 --> 01:20:31.443]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[01:20:31.443 --> 01:20:38.128]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling Power Hub unit.
[01:20:38.128 --> 01:20:41.090]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[01:20:41.090 --> 01:20:44.113]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[01:20:44.113 --> 01:20:47.756]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar-powered.
[01:20:47.756 --> 01:20:50.178]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[01:20:50.678 --> 01:20:55.661]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[01:20:55.661 --> 01:21:00.443]  That's BeatTheBlackouts.com.

[01:22:00.322 --> 01:22:01.303]  Hi there.
[01:22:01.303 --> 01:22:02.844]  My name is Frank Bates.
[01:22:02.844 --> 01:22:06.666]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[01:22:06.666 --> 01:22:15.812]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[01:22:15.812 --> 01:22:22.537]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[01:22:22.537 --> 01:22:24.718]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[01:22:24.718 --> 01:22:29.802]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[01:22:30.522 --> 01:22:38.468]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[01:22:38.468 --> 01:22:44.052]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patrons have already seen in the last three months.

[01:22:56.260 --> 01:22:57.381]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[01:23:00.501 --> 01:23:04.343]  In this unpredictable world, disaster can strike anyone.
[01:23:04.343 --> 01:23:10.685]  That's why an essential part of any emergency survival plan must be stove-in-a-can.
[01:23:10.685 --> 01:23:20.369]  When power goes out and gas lines are down, the portable, safe, easy-to-use stove-in-a-can cooks food up to four hours and boils water in as little as five minutes.

[01:24:05.514 --> 01:24:08.776]  I'm like a caged, desperate animal just clawing, trying to get out.
[01:24:10.435 --> 01:24:11.216]  We're being poisoned.
[01:24:11.216 --> 01:24:11.896]  We're being killed.
[01:24:11.896 --> 01:24:15.058]  The globalists brag they've set up a scientific dictatorship.
[01:24:15.058 --> 01:24:16.319]  They're trying to mop up freedom.
[01:24:16.319 --> 01:24:18.260]  Trying to get rid of our families.
[01:24:18.260 --> 01:24:19.761]  Promoting the end of families.
[01:24:19.761 --> 01:24:21.863]  It's just pure evil.
[01:24:21.863 --> 01:24:23.804]  And they admit the fluoride's killing us.
[01:24:23.804 --> 01:24:26.186]  They admit the GMO is sterilizing us.
[01:24:26.186 --> 01:24:31.910]  They're coming out with hundreds of new GMO crops where there's no way to escape it.
[01:24:31.910 --> 01:24:33.531]  They're attacking us at every level.
[01:24:36.796 --> 01:24:38.938]  And it's just so horrible.
[01:24:38.938 --> 01:24:45.104]  And I know it sounds crazy to an uninformed person to say elements of the government, stage 9-11.
[01:24:45.104 --> 01:24:46.905]  But then you look at the facts, it's all right there.
[01:24:46.905 --> 01:24:56.434]  I mean, it's crazy to say the government would ship guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment or would have troops growing the opium.
[01:24:56.434 --> 01:24:57.615]  But when it came out, they were.
[01:24:57.615 --> 01:25:03.520]  They just decided to hide it in plain view and have the troops talk about how it was patriotic to grow opium and ship it into America.
[01:25:05.697 --> 01:25:07.558]  And the caller brings up the Al-Qaeda.
[01:25:07.558 --> 01:25:21.745]  There are hundreds of articles where they just say, oh yeah, Al-Qaeda is being armed by NATO, but, and Saudi Arabia, and well, yeah, and they, but they're the good guys, and yeah, they're blowing up the military bases and stuff, and Assad's bad, though.
[01:25:21.745 --> 01:25:24.426]  What we're doing's humanitarian.
[01:25:24.426 --> 01:25:32.390]  Because they just know the average American's seen so many Hollywood movies where anybody in the Middle East needs to be killed, you know, because Chuck Norris has taken them out, or whatever.
[01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:42.366]  I know Chuck's a listener, been on the show before, writes about me in his column all the time, but, I mean, you know what I'm talking about, where all those movies in the 80s where it's always the Arab doing the bad things.
[01:25:42.366 --> 01:25:47.130]  People just, in a generality, just say, kill everybody over there.
[01:25:47.130 --> 01:25:50.913]  And you try to tell a good old boy, hey, you know the government runs Al-Qaeda.
[01:25:50.913 --> 01:25:54.175]  Hey, you know the government got the underwear bomber on the plane drugged.
[01:25:54.175 --> 01:25:56.177]  State Department admits that.
[01:25:56.177 --> 01:25:59.179]  They're just like, oh, come on, it ain't true.
[01:25:59.179 --> 01:26:01.281]  Well, let me tell you, what you don't know will hurt you.
[01:26:03.670 --> 01:26:05.991]  And people are like, well, what do you do about it then?
[01:26:05.991 --> 01:26:10.532]  You start speaking out against this system and you realize it's the whole thing at the top.
[01:26:10.532 --> 01:26:16.073]  That's the only thing that's going to turn this around.
[01:26:16.073 --> 01:26:20.975]  I'm going to talk about that after the break, but who was I just talking to?
[01:26:20.975 --> 01:26:21.615]  They dropped off.
[01:26:21.615 --> 01:26:28.197]  I want him to come back and finish his story about talking to family about the Al Qaeda and how it was finally in the news.
[01:26:28.197 --> 01:26:29.717]  That's why I said, stay there to the caller.
[01:26:31.610 --> 01:26:32.751]  Oh, it doesn't matter.
[01:26:32.751 --> 01:26:36.294]  Let's go to Anthony in New Jersey, listening on XM-166.
[01:26:36.294 --> 01:26:38.255]  You're on the air, sir.
[01:26:38.255 --> 01:26:39.556]  Alex, how you doing?
[01:26:39.556 --> 01:26:41.157]  I'm just... It's all coming true.
[01:26:41.157 --> 01:26:41.958]  I wish I was wrong.
[01:26:41.958 --> 01:26:44.039]  I'm pretty freaked out.
[01:26:44.039 --> 01:26:44.520]  I'm with you.
[01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:44.920]  I'm with you.
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:49.123]  I mean, during the last break, it just hit me again how crazy this is, and I can't believe I'm the one fighting it.
[01:26:49.123 --> 01:26:51.365]  Do you have any idea how dangerous this is?
[01:26:51.365 --> 01:26:52.345]  But it's gotta be done.
[01:26:52.345 --> 01:26:54.587]  I mean, this nightmare has to stop.
[01:26:54.587 --> 01:26:55.168]  I'm sorry.
[01:26:55.168 --> 01:26:55.588]  Go ahead.
[01:26:55.588 --> 01:26:57.229]  I agree.
[01:26:57.229 --> 01:26:58.450]  I agree.
[01:26:58.450 --> 01:27:01.032]  A couple years ago, I was traveling by plane.
[01:27:01.488 --> 01:27:04.730]  And I was subject to a molestation by the TSA.
[01:27:04.730 --> 01:27:09.373]  And since that point and listening to your show, I was going to be ready the next time I traveled.
[01:27:09.373 --> 01:27:19.639]  So last week I traveled to Vegas and before I got on the plane, of course I had to go through the TSA and I opt out.
[01:27:19.639 --> 01:27:26.883]  I didn't go through the machine and because I did it, I got at least four of the people behind me who did the same thing.
[01:27:26.883 --> 01:27:27.223]  And, uh,
[01:27:28.126 --> 01:27:29.507]  And I was just really upset.
[01:27:50.237 --> 01:27:50.898]  I don't think so.
[01:28:10.546 --> 01:28:17.412]  I happen to open up the magazine on the airplane, and it just opened up to this article by the guy who owned United.
[01:28:17.412 --> 01:28:30.363]  He's the CEO, and he states in this article that, you know, we thank you for flying with us, and we're happy for your business, but we just want to let you know that the TSA isn't... We don't control the TSA.
[01:28:30.363 --> 01:28:35.948]  They're a separate thing, and we're sorry for your inconvenience, but we don't have any control over that.
[01:28:37.957 --> 01:28:41.178]  Listen, the TSA has caused a revolt.
[01:28:41.178 --> 01:28:42.959]  And in Europe, similar things.
[01:28:42.959 --> 01:28:44.640]  It's unifying everybody.
[01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:47.121]  And they know it's going to make us mad.
[01:28:47.121 --> 01:28:50.063]  They've got to break us to touch us on the streets.
[01:28:50.063 --> 01:28:53.144]  To get rid of the Fourth Amendment, next it's our houses.
[01:28:53.144 --> 01:28:55.945]  Airports, streets, houses.
[01:28:55.945 --> 01:28:58.647]  And so that's why all the marbles are on this.
[01:28:58.647 --> 01:29:04.970]  It's killing $40 billion a year conservatively just in theme parks, restaurants, hotels, and resorts.
[01:29:05.530 --> 01:29:09.575]  Okay, they're destroying the country, but that's what they want.
[01:29:09.575 --> 01:29:23.390]  I'm sorry finish your story So in this article it says now That they're pleased to say that the TSA has launched a new risk based pre-screening initiative where you voluntarily give your information and
[01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:30.905]  To be a part of the expedited program which would then allow you to not have to remove your shoes, belts, jackets.
[01:29:30.905 --> 01:29:33.127]  Yeah, but that's a lie too.
[01:29:33.127 --> 01:29:34.728]  It says they may let you.
[01:29:34.728 --> 01:29:38.451]  It's still just another lane and then the groping will continue.
[01:29:38.451 --> 01:29:39.532]  They're gonna have three levels.
[01:29:39.532 --> 01:29:44.996]  Full rape room, open grope, and then a special lane for good globalists.
[01:29:44.996 --> 01:29:46.717]  But still they may drag you out.
[01:29:46.717 --> 01:29:49.779]  So yeah, it's hurting you into the next level of slavery.
[01:29:49.779 --> 01:29:51.180]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.180 --> 01:29:52.682]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.701 --> 01:29:56.367]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.541 --> 01:30:06.046]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[01:30:06.046 --> 01:30:08.468]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[01:30:08.468 --> 01:30:17.555]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure, and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[01:30:17.555 --> 01:30:21.018]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[01:30:21.018 --> 01:30:22.699]  There's no priming required.
[01:30:22.699 --> 01:30:24.961]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[01:30:24.961 --> 01:30:27.463]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[01:30:28.524 --> 01:30:30.045]  Easy to set up and use.
[01:30:30.045 --> 01:30:31.466]  Doesn't require electricity.
[01:30:31.466 --> 01:30:34.629]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:38.032]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[01:30:38.032 --> 01:30:42.175]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:30:42.175 --> 01:30:44.897]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:30:44.897 --> 01:30:46.479]  It's what my family uses.
[01:30:46.479 --> 01:30:49.801]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.

[01:32:00.959 --> 01:32:06.964]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid, and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[01:32:06.964 --> 01:32:12.549]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[01:32:12.549 --> 01:32:14.791]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[01:32:14.791 --> 01:32:22.297]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[01:32:22.797 --> 01:32:26.600]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:30.943]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[01:32:30.943 --> 01:32:37.808]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling Power Hub unit.
[01:32:37.808 --> 01:32:40.851]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[01:32:40.851 --> 01:32:43.953]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[01:32:43.953 --> 01:32:47.696]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar-powered.
[01:32:47.696 --> 01:32:50.178]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[01:32:50.698 --> 01:32:55.802]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[01:32:55.802 --> 01:33:01.507]  That's BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[01:33:01.507 --> 01:33:12.375]  All right, I'm going to talk about some of the most hardcore focused information I've ever discussed here in a moment.
[01:33:12.375 --> 01:33:13.356]  I am Alex Jones.
[01:33:13.356 --> 01:33:14.017]  I am your host.
[01:33:14.017 --> 01:33:14.457]  I am 110% dedicated.
[01:33:18.203 --> 01:33:25.767]  To throwing my body, my soul, my will, my entire being against the enemy.
[01:33:25.767 --> 01:33:41.295]  And I know, in my gut, but also from history and research, that of a core of humanity, of every race, color, creed, religion, who is aware of these truths, activates your human survival programming that God gave us.
[01:33:42.441 --> 01:34:01.505]  Your brain, if you set about focusing on it, will give you the ideas and the motivation and the energy to mount an assault in your area, in the Info War, to defeat the globalists, to discredit them, to drag their names to the mud, to crush them.
[01:34:01.505 --> 01:34:10.787]  And I will tell you this now, if you will not use the pen today, you will never use the sword tomorrow.
[01:34:13.642 --> 01:34:31.257]  All of you out there preparing with your armaments for civil war, you need to understand that you will never have the will to carry out defense of your family now if you don't get out there and engage in the end fall war today.
[01:34:32.008 --> 01:34:40.811]  Can you imagine the energy it'll take to go out and start engaging in warfare compared to aggressive info war?
[01:34:40.811 --> 01:34:43.272]  90% of war nowadays is info war.
[01:34:43.272 --> 01:34:44.353]  We have the truth.
[01:34:44.353 --> 01:34:45.653]  They have the lies.
[01:34:45.653 --> 01:34:49.014]  Truth trumps, trumps, trumps, trumps lies.
[01:34:49.014 --> 01:34:50.535]  It's so powerful.
[01:34:50.535 --> 01:34:52.836]  It's a weapon that nothing can stop.
[01:34:52.836 --> 01:34:54.456]  Use it!
[01:34:54.456 --> 01:34:54.917]  Use it!
[01:34:54.917 --> 01:34:56.337]  Destroy them!
[01:34:56.337 --> 01:34:58.538]  Destroy them with it!
[01:34:58.538 --> 01:34:59.498]  It's a weapon!
[01:34:59.498 --> 01:35:00.919]  Viciously attack them with it!
[01:35:01.874 --> 01:35:03.696]  Hate them!
[01:35:03.696 --> 01:35:06.639]  Get your human instinct going!
[01:35:06.639 --> 01:35:10.022]  Get your survival mode activated!
[01:35:10.022 --> 01:35:14.727]  This is how humans are supposed to act, not the little ninnies that they've tried to engineer us to be.
[01:35:14.727 --> 01:35:17.890]  You want to be like that Facebook clown?
[01:35:17.890 --> 01:35:20.513]  That's what they've turned people where I live in Austin into.
[01:35:20.513 --> 01:35:25.138]  You're trendy if you can't talk and talk with a list but don't care about anything and hurt yourself.
[01:35:27.065 --> 01:35:30.961]  I'm gonna talk about something that really makes me mad in a moment, but can we pull up that Facebook thing?
[01:35:30.961 --> 01:35:32.708]  People can hear the voice of a zombie.
[01:35:34.110 --> 01:35:35.331]  Wanna hear the voice of a zombie?
[01:35:35.331 --> 01:35:39.234]  This is everything that we're diametrically opposed to.
[01:35:39.234 --> 01:35:41.536]  This is an ad for their face scanning to buy and sell.
[01:35:41.536 --> 01:35:50.203]  They give you discounts if you let them track your whole background and your whole database and tell you what you should buy because the computer knows who you are in the profile.
[01:35:50.203 --> 01:35:56.208]  Just like they're tracking you and know where you're gonna go with your cell phone before you go there, they know you're gonna go to that steakhouse.
[01:35:56.208 --> 01:36:01.412]  ...to evolve the check-in process by using a seamless method for checking in and getting...
[01:36:02.433 --> 01:36:04.335]  Just like Hitler said.
[01:36:04.335 --> 01:36:10.521]  Just like Hitler said, first you get the women, then you got the children.
[01:36:20.336 --> 01:36:22.357]  So follow the women.
[01:36:22.357 --> 01:36:27.199]  Not that women are weak or bad, it's that evil always targets women first.
[01:36:27.199 --> 01:36:30.060]  I'm not talking about Adam and Eve, folks, even if you don't believe that.
[01:36:30.060 --> 01:36:31.581]  The point is, propaganda.
[01:36:31.581 --> 01:36:34.162]  Go read Hitler and Goebbels on women.
[01:36:34.162 --> 01:36:36.543]  Women run society.
[01:36:36.543 --> 01:36:39.244]  Men serve women in the final equation.
[01:36:39.244 --> 01:36:41.685]  Women create the babies.
[01:36:41.685 --> 01:36:45.207]  Women live longer, they have more money.
[01:36:46.107 --> 01:36:47.568]  In the Western world?
[01:36:47.568 --> 01:36:49.949]  Oh yeah, women have more money than men.
[01:36:49.949 --> 01:36:53.311]  Women have always been in the catbird seat.
[01:36:53.311 --> 01:36:58.254]  Men think they're in control, but they're out there fighting and dying and striving in every culture.
[01:36:58.254 --> 01:36:59.415]  Women are the heart.
[01:36:59.415 --> 01:37:01.576]  Women buy over 80% of the goods.
[01:37:01.576 --> 01:37:04.658]  That's why most advertising targets women.
[01:37:04.658 --> 01:37:06.639]  Talk radio is an anomaly.
[01:37:06.639 --> 01:37:07.180]  Mainly men.
[01:37:08.954 --> 01:37:10.475]  Women are targeted.
[01:37:10.475 --> 01:37:11.636]  Women want to be friendly.
[01:37:11.636 --> 01:37:13.098]  They want to get along.
[01:37:13.098 --> 01:37:14.499]  They want to be friendly.
[01:37:14.499 --> 01:37:25.749]  And here's a Globalist Defense Department, New World Order, tracking AI, pre-crime, rolled out, face scanning to buy and sell, background check to buy and sell.
[01:37:25.749 --> 01:37:27.010]  Confidently recognized.
[01:37:27.010 --> 01:37:30.593]  It's like, oh, this is fun, oh.
[01:37:32.202 --> 01:37:35.844]  That's nothing to worry about.
[01:37:35.844 --> 01:37:36.545]  Life history.
[01:37:36.545 --> 01:37:40.607]  Oh, oh, oh, yeah.
[01:37:40.607 --> 01:37:41.928]  With that droning voice.
[01:37:41.928 --> 01:37:47.731]  When you're a trendy, when you talk about something really, really destructive, you kind of are allowed to get a little excited.
[01:37:47.731 --> 01:37:50.773]  So it's like life history.
[01:37:50.773 --> 01:37:51.994]  It's so fun.
[01:37:51.994 --> 01:37:53.334]  Checking you in.
[01:37:53.334 --> 01:37:54.355]  Checking you in.
[01:37:54.355 --> 01:37:54.815]  That's enough.
[01:37:54.815 --> 01:37:55.756]  Turn it off.
[01:37:55.756 --> 01:37:56.456]  Oh, my gosh.
[01:37:56.456 --> 01:37:57.477]  It's hellish.
[01:37:57.477 --> 01:38:00.298]  Imagine being locked in a cell with somebody talking like that.
[01:38:00.298 --> 01:38:00.739]  All right.
[01:38:00.739 --> 01:38:00.919]  Now.
[01:38:02.301 --> 01:38:13.586]  That's somebody that's never done anything, never been anybody, never, never, never, never actually seen anything.
[01:38:13.586 --> 01:38:23.110]  I'll guarantee you, somebody talking and acting like that's never had four guys get around them in a dark alley and start pounding on them, and had to find out who you are to get their butts kicked and get them off of you.
[01:38:23.110 --> 01:38:26.872]  I'll guarantee you, somebody like that has never worked very hard in their life.
[01:38:26.872 --> 01:38:29.913]  I'll guarantee you, somebody like that doesn't know their head from a hole in the ground.
[01:38:31.946 --> 01:38:35.269]  And that's what we've become, jellyfish to the New World Order.
[01:38:35.269 --> 01:38:39.614]  So of course they're moving on every front against us.
[01:38:39.614 --> 01:38:44.358]  Let me just stop for just a minute.
[01:38:44.358 --> 01:38:45.740]  I want to take a pause for a moment.
[01:38:45.740 --> 01:38:46.340]  Will you go to...
[01:38:48.686 --> 01:38:55.747]  Prison Planet Live, Paul Watson's site, and on that YouTube site, we've got that three-minute promo for ProPure.
[01:38:55.747 --> 01:38:57.208]  This military news is so important.
[01:38:57.208 --> 01:39:04.909]  I want to get out of this floundering mode I get into, which is entertaining radio, I know, but it's literally my brain just going off in a million directions.
[01:39:04.909 --> 01:39:08.070]  So I need to pause here for just a moment.
[01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:12.351]  If you go to YouTube, guys, and all you've got to do, you also have the ad loader.
[01:39:12.351 --> 01:39:13.331]  I don't want the nine-minute one.
[01:39:13.331 --> 01:39:14.351]  I want the three-minute one.
[01:39:14.351 --> 01:39:15.571]  You go to Prison Planet Live.
[01:39:15.571 --> 01:39:16.252]  It's Paul Watson's.
[01:39:16.252 --> 01:39:18.192]  In fact, I'll just pull it up right here on this computer, and I'll show you.
[01:39:19.790 --> 01:39:20.670]  I'll just do it myself.
[01:39:20.670 --> 01:39:22.691]  YouTube.com.
[01:39:22.691 --> 01:39:22.971]  Boom.
[01:39:22.971 --> 01:39:25.892]  Okay.
[01:39:25.892 --> 01:39:27.833]  You go there.
[01:39:27.833 --> 01:39:28.653]  Quickest way to do it.
[01:39:28.653 --> 01:39:31.355]  Just type Alex Jones in.
[01:39:31.355 --> 01:39:36.296]  One of the channels linked on our big channel.
[01:39:36.296 --> 01:39:37.417]  You scroll down.
[01:39:37.417 --> 01:39:40.218]  Okay.
[01:39:40.218 --> 01:39:42.619]  It's going to show you guys where this is at.
[01:39:42.619 --> 01:39:47.561]  Paul Watson's Prison Planet Live.
[01:39:50.745 --> 01:39:54.768]  And you just go there and you get it right off that site.
[01:39:54.768 --> 01:39:55.969]  Hell, I'll just put it into Google.
[01:39:55.969 --> 01:39:56.609]  I'll show you right now.
[01:39:56.609 --> 01:39:58.030]  It says Prison Planet.
[01:39:58.030 --> 01:40:04.795]  Prison Planet Live YouTube.com.
[01:40:04.795 --> 01:40:11.600]  Bam!
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:13.241]  And it pulls up Paul Watson's site.
[01:40:13.241 --> 01:40:13.682]  There it is.
[01:40:13.682 --> 01:40:17.644]  Okay.
[01:40:17.644 --> 01:40:18.745]  Go to a site.
[01:40:18.745 --> 01:40:19.506]  Go to rebroadcast.
[01:40:26.223 --> 01:40:29.757]  We're good to go.
[01:40:59.372 --> 01:41:01.953]  We're good to go.
[01:41:42.990 --> 01:41:48.093]  All my work and endless measures never seem to get me very far.
[01:41:48.093 --> 01:42:03.503]  Walk a mile just to move an inch now even though I'm trying so damn hard.
[01:42:26.912 --> 01:42:32.979]  I really enjoy it when the globalists try to poison us and well, we resist them via a free market system.
[01:42:33.919 --> 01:42:41.329]  Hello my fellow info warriors, Alex Jones here introducing you to the ProPure family of gravity-fed filters.
[01:42:41.329 --> 01:42:48.298]  Now, you know that the globalists are filling our water with radioactive isotopes, fluoride, lead, mercury, arsenic.
[01:42:48.979 --> 01:42:58.793]  And one of the few systems that can efficiently and economically remove or reduce down to non-detectable levels these poisons are gravity-fed filters.
[01:42:58.793 --> 01:43:01.556]  And ProPure is the top of the line.
[01:43:01.556 --> 01:43:04.140]  Their filters are impregnated with silver,
[01:43:04.961 --> 01:43:06.782]  A natural antibiotic.
[01:43:06.782 --> 01:43:10.443]  On top of that, they're bigger so they filter faster.
[01:43:10.443 --> 01:43:13.944]  You don't have to prime these the first time you use them.
[01:43:13.944 --> 01:43:14.625]  It's amazing!
[01:43:14.625 --> 01:43:20.427]  Go to InfoWars.com and click on the shopping cart link to see the entire family of these babies.
[01:43:21.471 --> 01:43:26.735]  Now, the fluoride they add to our water is so tiny that most filters can't cut it out.
[01:43:26.735 --> 01:43:32.819]  But ProPure has their system that will, again, reduce it to non-detectable levels.
[01:43:32.819 --> 01:43:35.020]  Almost get all of it out of there.
[01:43:35.020 --> 01:43:36.321]  That's also available.
[01:43:36.321 --> 01:43:48.409]  And if you look at the different systems they offer, the ProPure big brush finish is on a stand, so it's easier on a table or at your restaurant or wherever you have it to go up with a glass or a mug and fill it up.
[01:43:48.409 --> 01:43:49.770]  Then there's this big baby right here.
[01:43:49.810 --> 01:43:49.910]  Yeah.
[01:44:10.157 --> 01:44:15.604]  Small and portable but packs a huge punch, cleans out all that garbage.
[01:44:15.604 --> 01:44:22.293]  They also have the glass site spigot so you don't have to take the top off and look in the bottom area to see how much water.
[01:44:22.293 --> 01:44:24.797]  You can see how fast it's filtering with this optional
[01:44:25.077 --> 01:44:25.417]  I don't think so.
[01:44:44.756 --> 01:44:48.619]  And I use ProPure in my home and my office.
[01:44:48.619 --> 01:44:53.103]  And I recommend that you check out the information on ProPure at Infowars.com.
[01:44:53.103 --> 01:44:59.328]  We already have the lowest price at Infowars.com on the ProPure gravity filter system.
[01:45:00.109 --> 01:45:08.479]  But when you add in the 10% off when InfoWarriors use the product code WATER at InfoWars.com, nobody can top it.
[01:45:08.479 --> 01:45:09.901]  So again, it's a win-win-win.
[01:45:09.901 --> 01:45:12.263]  Stop drinking the poison water.
[01:45:12.263 --> 01:45:15.107]  Checkmate the globalists when it comes to your health.
[01:45:15.107 --> 01:45:18.591]  And support InfoWars.com and the work we're doing here.
[01:45:18.931 --> 01:45:23.614]  You know, many revolutionaries rob banks and things and kidnap people for funds.
[01:45:23.614 --> 01:45:28.538]  We promote in the free market the products we use that are about preparedness.
[01:45:28.538 --> 01:45:39.126]  That's how we fund this revolution against the New World Order in our move to restore our constitutional republic and a spirit of 1776 worldwide.
[01:45:39.126 --> 01:45:40.387]  Check it out at InfoWars.com.
[01:45:41.147 --> 01:45:50.134]  ProPure, top of the line, number one, most powerful and effective and economical gravity-fed water system in the world.
[01:45:50.134 --> 01:45:54.137]  ProPure, available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[01:45:54.137 --> 01:45:57.539]  Don't forget product code, water to save 10%.
[01:45:57.539 --> 01:46:00.642]  It's the latest generation, years in development.
[01:46:00.642 --> 01:46:05.425]  ProPure is the name.
[01:46:05.425 --> 01:46:07.447]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're back here.
[01:46:07.447 --> 01:46:08.408]  I took a little break.
[01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:22.384]  I'm going to try to cover this news because every time I'm at an airport or on the street and somebody's in a uniform, everyone runs up and says, oh, I want to thank you for your service.
[01:46:22.384 --> 01:46:24.165]  I want to thank you for your service.
[01:46:24.165 --> 01:46:29.247]  And they just do it because it makes them feel good like they're doing the right thing.
[01:46:29.247 --> 01:46:33.008]  Meanwhile, Americans hold less passports than anybody else in the world.
[01:46:33.008 --> 01:46:38.470]  Americans in major polls, I have a new one today, could care less about what's happening in the world or the military.
[01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:40.531]  In real polls, they could care less about you.
[01:46:42.302 --> 01:46:43.964]  And our military is not our military.
[01:46:43.964 --> 01:46:45.705]  It's openly run by foreign banks.
[01:46:45.705 --> 01:46:52.011]  They tell our military that NATO and the UN run our military.
[01:46:52.011 --> 01:46:54.113]  The bankers brag they've captured our country.
[01:46:54.113 --> 01:46:59.658]  So I thought I would break down for you why the troops are committing suicide in Mash.
[01:46:59.658 --> 01:47:03.542]  Americans tune out of Afghan war as fighting rages on, Associated Press.
[01:47:04.864 --> 01:47:08.848]  And it goes through the fact it was once President Barack Obama's War of Necessity.
[01:47:08.848 --> 01:47:10.149]  Now it's America's Forgotten War.
[01:47:10.149 --> 01:47:12.031]  Yeah, because they said the war ended.
[01:47:12.031 --> 01:47:21.120]  You just tell people it ended and they didn't end, but... You know, you tell people burning down the Waco Church ended in an assault, and they go, well, it ended in an assault.
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:23.863]  They tell you tasering you for no reason isn't torture, but it is.
[01:47:24.795 --> 01:47:27.678]  An Afghan conflict generates barely a whisper on the U.S.
[01:47:27.678 --> 01:47:29.419]  presidential campaign trail.
[01:47:29.419 --> 01:47:34.063]  It's not a hot topic at the office water cooler or in the halls of Congress.
[01:47:34.063 --> 01:47:41.510]  Even though there are 80,000 American troops, not to mention more contractors than that, that are still fighting here and dying at a rate of one a day.
[01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:42.831]  You gotta grow the opium!
[01:47:45.234 --> 01:47:49.937]  And it goes on to show public opinion against it, but don't really care.
[01:47:49.937 --> 01:48:01.102]  Now, I thought I'd just mention that because I happen to have military personnel and veteran suicide prevention numbers here from AFSP.
[01:48:01.102 --> 01:48:07.145]  And it goes over the rise in suicides in the last 10 years.
[01:48:07.145 --> 01:48:10.027]  It's been steadily, steadily rising.
[01:48:14.915 --> 01:48:18.117]  It's been steadily, steadily rising.
[01:48:18.117 --> 01:48:21.778]  There are more people committing suicide that are dying in all the conflicts.
[01:48:21.778 --> 01:48:23.079]  Now, let me explain what this is.
[01:48:23.079 --> 01:48:24.480]  It's a cocktail of things.
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:31.763]  They're killing a lot of officers and investigators, fragging them.
[01:48:31.763 --> 01:48:36.405]  The mercenaries and people are, who report on corruption.
[01:48:36.405 --> 01:48:38.926]  That's a small part of it, but that's part of the numbers.
[01:48:38.926 --> 01:48:41.748]  They always call it suicide when they shoot you in the head in your trailer.
[01:48:43.945 --> 01:48:47.307]  A lot of the troops are doing 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 tours.
[01:48:47.307 --> 01:48:48.588]  Their families are falling apart.
[01:48:48.588 --> 01:48:50.569]  Their paychecks won't pay for things.
[01:48:50.569 --> 01:48:52.971]  They feel bad about what they've done, so they're committing suicide.
[01:48:52.971 --> 01:49:01.977]  I mean, if you feel bad about military operations, you know, you feel terrible no matter what the propaganda is, no matter, you know, how you've been lied to.
[01:49:01.977 --> 01:49:05.299]  You wake up, it's a fraud, and you kind of have a self-disposal switch.
[01:49:05.859 --> 01:49:08.161]  Your body says you're not good for the tribe, kill yourself.
[01:49:08.161 --> 01:49:09.742]  Your mind does it, you get depressed.
[01:49:09.742 --> 01:49:15.887]  When you could, repent, get out of it, like Pat Tillman was gonna do, and speak out against it.
[01:49:15.887 --> 01:49:17.549]  But instead, you just kill yourselves.
[01:49:17.549 --> 01:49:18.870]  Not a good idea.
[01:49:18.870 --> 01:49:24.635]  You should kill yourself politically, getting the word out, busting your butt to tell the truth.
[01:49:24.635 --> 01:49:25.996]  You should make it right.
[01:49:25.996 --> 01:49:30.860]  If you've had an abortion, and you know it's wrong now, go out and fight to save lives of other children.
[01:49:30.860 --> 01:49:31.961]  Go out and adopt children.
[01:49:33.134 --> 01:49:34.134]  Don't kill yourself.
[01:49:34.134 --> 01:49:35.534]  That's a cop-out.
[01:49:35.534 --> 01:49:38.135]  That's a coward's way out.
[01:49:38.135 --> 01:49:51.977]  Now, the biggest reason that troops are committing suicide, because I've gone and looked at most of these cases, they've been in 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 tours, which they wouldn't even do in World War II, make you serve more than one tour.
[01:49:51.977 --> 01:49:55.058]  A lot of it really stressful, door-to-door type stuff.
[01:49:55.058 --> 01:50:00.079]  It's really abusive policing stuff where you're hated, where you're seeing dead kids.
[01:50:00.079 --> 01:50:00.539]  It's horrible.
[01:50:02.819 --> 01:50:12.928]  And so what's happening is they're putting them on Prozac and other serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other experimental drugs.
[01:50:12.928 --> 01:50:16.391]  Other experimental drugs.
[01:50:16.391 --> 01:50:20.995]  And I have an article here called The Marshall Plan in a Wired Magazine.
[01:50:20.995 --> 01:50:26.640]  The 40 years the man behind Pentagon Insiders called Yoda has foreseen the future of war.
[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:30.123]  And he says in the future it won't be what weapons but what drugs the troops are on.
[01:50:31.018 --> 01:50:37.401]  They're experimenting with a bunch of psychotropics, viral injections that reprogram the brain, you name it.
[01:50:37.401 --> 01:50:51.489]  And in most of the suicide cases, because I've gone and looked up a bunch of them, they were under psychiatric care and sent back out, and now their impulse control is removed by the drugs, and that's why they're killing themselves and others.
[01:50:51.489 --> 01:50:56.731]  I mean, the Prozac insert says it increases suicide psychotic activities.
[01:50:56.731 --> 01:50:58.752]  So, that's what's going on here.
[01:50:58.752 --> 01:50:59.273]  We'll be back.
[01:51:00.953 --> 01:51:05.715]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:51:05.715 --> 01:51:08.756]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:51:08.756 --> 01:51:17.719]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:51:17.719 --> 01:51:22.641]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:51:23.274 --> 01:51:34.644]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[01:51:34.644 --> 01:51:41.650]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.

[01:53:03.007 --> 01:53:07.470]  Did you know that a solar storm in 1989 caused an enormous blackout in Quebec?
[01:53:07.470 --> 01:53:09.192]  Here's the really bad news.
[01:53:09.192 --> 01:53:15.717]  Experts are predicting that solar storms will get really severe over the next year, and our electric grid is extremely vulnerable.
[01:53:15.717 --> 01:53:24.424]  In fact, the Wall Street Journal reported that we could soon face blackouts lasting weeks or months, leaving major parts of the USA temporarily uninhabitable.
[01:53:24.904 --> 01:53:27.106]  Are you prepared for this coming crisis?

[01:54:28.114 --> 01:54:33.757]  Alright, so continuing with the epidemic of suicide by military personnel and contractors.
[01:54:33.757 --> 01:54:42.881]  When you do something immorally wrong, even if your conscious mind has been programmed by media propaganda, deep down you feel like crap.
[01:54:42.881 --> 01:54:47.524]  And that's why in our entire 236 years of the U.S.
[01:54:47.524 --> 01:54:52.926]  Army, it's seven-fold the previous record in the Vietnam era of suicides.
[01:54:52.926 --> 01:54:53.747]  You can look up the numbers.
[01:54:55.836 --> 01:55:00.120]  That's a sign that evil runs this country.
[01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:07.006]  And all the folks out there are like, hire a warrior, do this and that.
[01:55:07.006 --> 01:55:12.791]  No, we need to end these evil wars and we need to get them off of big pharma, mind control drugs.
[01:55:12.791 --> 01:55:19.276]  I mean, the head futurist at the Army, at the Pentagon, Andrew Marshall, a futurist,
[01:55:20.290 --> 01:55:25.972]  He's the one that decides to put them on psychotropics, uh, halcyon, amnesiacs.
[01:55:25.972 --> 01:55:30.914]  I mean, they are putting them, and they admit it here, all these hundreds of drugs.
[01:55:30.914 --> 01:55:32.254]  It's called the Marshall Plan.
[01:55:32.254 --> 01:55:38.276]  For 40 years, the Pentagon's insider, called Yoda, has foreseen the future of war.
[01:55:38.276 --> 01:55:47.800]  From battlefield bots rolling over radar-proof ships to GI popping performance pills, all that was before the war on terror.
[01:55:50.077 --> 01:55:56.078]  And they go over all of this is an article from 2003, by the way, nine years ago.
[01:55:56.078 --> 01:56:08.221]  Okay, so everything you see in the newborn movie, when I saw that a few nights ago with the crew, it totally freaked me out because everything in it was real programs, just pieces of it.
[01:56:08.221 --> 01:56:18.704]  And they were showing you what they're really doing, including in the 21st century, they don't just give you pills, they inject you with viruses that will go in and destroy the
[01:56:20.996 --> 01:56:34.651]  Areas of the brain that give you what you'd call the conscience to not kill a child or the natural governor to where you can't run 50 miles because you might have a heart attack.
[01:56:35.421 --> 01:56:38.143]  They just removed that, and they have injected troops with it.
[01:56:38.143 --> 01:56:42.486]  They injected troops, special forces with microchips a decade ago.
[01:56:42.486 --> 01:56:49.751]  I talked to family about it, and when I brought it back up, just the fact that I'd mentioned that family told me that, they figured out who it was and got in their face.
[01:56:49.751 --> 01:56:54.274]  Now that person won't even talk to me.
[01:56:54.274 --> 01:56:55.996]  So, they put microchips in them.
[01:56:55.996 --> 01:57:03.161]  I mean, it's so far down the road, ladies and gentlemen, and they're using them like machines, that they're using them until the wheels come off.
[01:57:04.144 --> 01:57:16.193]  The globalists hate the military, and they know that they're a bunch of drugged up, overused people when they come back, so they either make them cops to oppress us, or they're saying they're the main enemy, put them all in prison.
[01:57:16.193 --> 01:57:17.814]  You know, they're terrorists.
[01:57:17.814 --> 01:57:27.221]  And I've got a National Guard article here, where they're saying the homeland is the biggest threat in the National Guard magazine, and that
[01:57:28.171 --> 01:57:29.992]  The returning veterans are the biggest threat.
[01:57:29.992 --> 01:57:34.295]  So here's the military being taught that they are the terrorists in their own magazine.
[01:57:34.295 --> 01:57:35.615]  Don wrote a story about it in June.
[01:57:35.615 --> 01:57:41.539]  I actually saw it doing some research this morning and reprinted it.
[01:57:41.539 --> 01:57:43.680]  Can't find it now.
[01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:46.082]  But my main point is this.
[01:57:46.082 --> 01:57:47.182]  Here's an RT article.
[01:57:47.182 --> 01:57:47.462]  U.S.
[01:57:47.462 --> 01:57:51.225]  Army grants $3 million for anti-suicide nasal spray research.
[01:57:51.225 --> 01:57:54.987]  And it's a very powerful drug chemical that basically turns them into automatons.
[01:57:56.735 --> 01:57:59.397]  But they shoot up their nose.
[01:57:59.397 --> 01:58:07.384]  And so they're just turning the troops into a bunch of drug heads who they can then say are mental patients or whatever down the road.
[01:58:07.384 --> 01:58:09.766]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[01:58:09.766 --> 01:58:13.149]  Because the globalists absolutely hate America and hate our military.
[01:58:13.149 --> 01:58:16.532]  They hate them so much they're going to use them to take over the world while they soft kill them.
[01:58:17.645 --> 01:58:23.668]  And then separately, you can pull this up, CBS News, stress vaccine, don't worry, shot us on the way, says doctors.
[01:58:23.668 --> 01:58:28.751]  They already are giving these to the troops that, again, make them where they don't feel bad about what they're doing.
[01:58:28.751 --> 01:58:32.753]  And they're now saying that, oh, don't worry, we're gonna give you a shot where you won't feel bad anymore.
[01:58:32.753 --> 01:58:35.494]  They're turning them literally into living zombies.
[01:58:35.494 --> 01:58:41.297]  I mean, we're living in a nightmare movie.
[01:58:41.297 --> 01:58:42.638]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:42.638 --> 01:58:46.179]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.799 --> 01:58:56.943]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[01:58:56.943 --> 01:58:59.905]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[01:58:59.905 --> 01:59:05.309]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[01:59:05.309 --> 01:59:10.272]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[01:59:10.272 --> 01:59:17.517]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods or meat foods direct now.
[01:59:17.897 --> 01:59:21.780]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[01:59:21.780 --> 01:59:23.561]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[01:59:23.561 --> 01:59:27.583]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we have all known this was coming.
[01:59:27.583 --> 01:59:30.485]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[01:59:30.485 --> 01:59:33.267]  The fact is you can eat at any time to save money today.
[01:59:33.267 --> 01:59:37.830]  And because it stores for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[01:59:37.830 --> 01:59:38.490]  Don't wait!
[01:59:38.490 --> 01:59:41.072]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:59:41.072 --> 01:59:41.592]  Call 800-409-5633 or eFoods
[01:59:46.155 --> 01:59:48.238]  eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:59:48.238 --> 01:59:53.726]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[01:59:53.726 --> 01:59:56.129]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.129 --> 01:59:58.893]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.424 --> 02:00:07.105]  You know, at about 40 after,
[02:00:34.704 --> 02:00:37.866]  In the last hour, I had to go off air.
[02:00:37.866 --> 02:00:45.230]  And it wasn't because I was mad at my crew because they couldn't find a three-minute commercial to play so I could take a break.
[02:00:45.230 --> 02:00:55.976]  I was mad because I have all this data on how they're drugging the troops, killing the troops, hurting them, and it makes me angry that they talk all day about how much they love the troops when they actually hate them.
[02:00:57.062 --> 02:01:03.323]  And they're using them up like a natural resource, and they're planning to play them off against us in a civil war.
[02:01:03.323 --> 02:01:18.907]  And then I've got to articulate all this, and I've got all these documents and articles about how they're giving them cancer injections, how they're letting them die of DU, they're injecting them with viruses that are actually nanotech, that reprogram the brain, and then they've got movies out.
[02:01:20.942 --> 02:01:23.264]  Born legacy, showing what's real.
[02:01:23.264 --> 02:01:25.626]  And then I've got all the government documents that are public.
[02:01:25.626 --> 02:01:27.768]  Who knows what is classified?
[02:01:27.768 --> 02:01:30.590]  And it just gets crazier and crazier and crazier.
[02:01:30.590 --> 02:01:34.453]  And then I know I sound like a crazy person on air to someone who's uninformed.
[02:01:34.453 --> 02:01:35.474]  It's a nightmare.
[02:01:35.474 --> 02:01:39.678]  And then I'm all set and ready to go.
[02:01:39.678 --> 02:01:41.960]  And then I start joking around about the Facebook thing.
[02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:44.342]  And then I lose my thoughts and I just get angry.
[02:01:47.554 --> 02:02:02.164]  And I'll tell you, it's because I'm like a raccoon that's been put in a cage and thrown into a cow pond to be killed.
[02:02:02.164 --> 02:02:09.850]  And the raccoon is up there clawing and scraping and trying to get out.
[02:02:09.850 --> 02:02:16.915]  And you can see it under about six inches of water trying to poke its nose out, trying to get to the surface, and you finally see it give up after a while.
[02:02:18.311 --> 02:02:29.285]  And I just am so tired of watching people in a zombie state getting poisoned and killed, and little kids that are getting sick and dying of cancer, and all the diabetes, and all the diseases, and all the curses, and all the deformities, and all the stuff that's happening.
[02:02:31.060 --> 02:02:36.065]  And the globalists are bragging how they did it, and I see them arming against us.
[02:02:36.065 --> 02:02:46.034]  And it's just if people knew what I knew and did the research and found out I wasn't making this up, there's no way any of you would put up with this, even if you were cowards.
[02:02:46.034 --> 02:02:55.323]  Because a coward would go, wow, we're doomed if we don't resist this.
[02:02:58.669 --> 02:03:03.112]  And then I feel guilty just constantly.
[02:03:03.112 --> 02:03:10.816]  Because I'm still a little bit worldly and do still enjoy status and money and things like that.
[02:03:10.816 --> 02:03:15.119]  And really, there's nothing wrong with having a little bit of money and status, because it gives you a little bit of protection.
[02:03:15.119 --> 02:03:19.402]  But, you know, you're rationalized, but you still feel bad, like you're not doing enough.
[02:03:19.402 --> 02:03:23.564]  That's why people call up and say, oh, you're doing such a great job.
[02:03:23.564 --> 02:03:24.945]  It's like getting punched in the nose, man.
[02:03:30.421 --> 02:03:34.263]  Because the callers are so sweet and so good.
[02:03:34.263 --> 02:03:39.005]  And it just reminds me of the general public being abused by the New World Order.
[02:03:39.005 --> 02:03:45.689]  Every time I look at my youngest daughter, who's so innocent and so full of good, I just... I think about what the globalists are doing to little children.
[02:03:45.689 --> 02:03:50.891]  And with the GMO and the vaccines and the fluoride and how they know it.
[02:03:50.891 --> 02:03:56.134]  And I think about city councils I've seen on video all over the country laughing at medical doctors that come in and warn them.
[02:03:59.810 --> 02:04:04.293]  Those idiot city council people are going to have their wives and husbands and kids die young.
[02:04:04.293 --> 02:04:10.817]  But they're so unhuman and dumbed down and like biological android jellyfish.
[02:04:10.817 --> 02:04:20.184]  They kind of get into the pageant of their wife or husband or kids dying and the media attention and the balloons and the parties and the race for the cure and everything.
[02:04:20.184 --> 02:04:20.964]  And they don't even care.
[02:04:20.964 --> 02:04:22.325]  They kind of like being killed.
[02:04:22.325 --> 02:04:27.649]  They kind of like their family dying.
[02:04:27.649 --> 02:04:29.290]  They're like demonic jellyfish.
[02:04:31.254 --> 02:04:32.394]  It's the best way to describe it.
[02:04:32.394 --> 02:04:44.576]  There are people who want to be judged and want to be destroyed and want the globalists to fly over with drones and release an engineered human mousepox so that 98% of them can flop around dying.
[02:04:44.576 --> 02:04:53.538]  And then when they do that, if they go to that level, which I know is part of their plan, the survivors will still worship the killers.
[02:04:53.538 --> 02:04:57.098]  Even though it's like, yeah, the drone flew over and did it, it won't matter.
[02:04:57.098 --> 02:05:00.079]  I mean, it's just, it's unbelievable.
[02:05:03.081 --> 02:05:11.207]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.
[02:05:11.207 --> 02:05:15.270]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.

[02:06:17.707 --> 02:06:21.150]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.

[02:06:31.616 --> 02:06:34.797]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[02:06:34.797 --> 02:06:38.158]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[02:06:38.158 --> 02:06:42.299]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[02:06:42.299 --> 02:06:45.040]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[02:06:45.040 --> 02:06:46.620]  It's what my family uses.
[02:06:46.620 --> 02:06:49.941]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[02:06:49.941 --> 02:06:55.183]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[02:06:55.763 --> 02:06:59.386]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[02:06:59.386 --> 02:07:01.887]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:07:01.887 --> 02:07:07.491]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:07:07.491 --> 02:07:12.494]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:07:12.494 --> 02:07:17.538]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:07:18.078 --> 02:07:23.282]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:07:23.282 --> 02:07:25.603]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:07:25.603 --> 02:07:30.406]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:07:30.406 --> 02:07:31.527]  And here's the best part.
[02:07:31.527 --> 02:07:34.589]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:07:34.589 --> 02:07:38.211]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:07:38.211 --> 02:07:41.414]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:07:41.414 --> 02:07:43.635]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:07:43.635 --> 02:07:44.556]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:07:48.198 --> 02:07:52.422]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:07:52.422 --> 02:07:57.267]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:07:57.267 --> 02:07:59.649]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:08:05.731 --> 02:08:10.575]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:08:10.575 --> 02:08:12.156]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.156 --> 02:08:13.697]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.697 --> 02:08:17.900]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.900 --> 02:08:21.963]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:42.924]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to continue with your calls and some other very important news from InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:08:42.924 --> 02:08:50.849]  If you just joined us towards the end of the last hour, I went over the numbers of all-time record suicides for the U.S.
[02:08:50.849 --> 02:08:52.089]  military across the board.
[02:08:52.089 --> 02:08:56.512]  And it's not just soldiers that are in combat.
[02:08:56.512 --> 02:08:57.852]  It's across the spectrum.
[02:08:57.852 --> 02:08:59.673]  It's contractors.
[02:08:59.673 --> 02:09:00.174]  You name it.
[02:09:01.172 --> 02:09:18.368]  And it's because when they ask any questions or go get medical checkups, they're pushing all sorts of experimental drugs, mind control drugs, that's in the news, on them, but also serotonin reuptake inhibitors that were developed actually in CIA mind control programs.
[02:09:19.289 --> 02:09:27.395]  You can look that up and cause massive psychotic breaks, massive increases in suicide, mass killings.
[02:09:27.395 --> 02:09:28.896]  That's on the drug inserts.
[02:09:28.896 --> 02:09:34.699]  Eli Lilly covered up that fact in the 80s, late 70s, early 80s when they were getting it approved in 1981.
[02:09:34.699 --> 02:09:39.463]  A massive, what, 15-fold increase in suicide and psychotic activity.
[02:09:39.463 --> 02:09:43.185]  It's not a good idea to give people that are combat veterans of 3, 4, 5, 6 terrors a drug like that.
[02:09:45.385 --> 02:09:48.946]  Because they're gonna start wanting to kill their family when their wife's getting in their face.
[02:09:48.946 --> 02:09:53.148]  So they just, instead of killing their family, they go kill themselves.
[02:09:53.148 --> 02:10:02.912]  That's what, I've looked at some of the crime files that are online, quite a few, and in most cases they were under psychiatric care on drugs.
[02:10:02.912 --> 02:10:13.816]  And you give somebody a hallucinogen that's a trained killer, it's bad news they're killing themselves, the good news is they're not killing their families, or those around them.
[02:10:15.695 --> 02:10:18.377]  And so that's what's going on.
[02:10:18.377 --> 02:10:21.419]  And let me just explain something here.
[02:10:21.419 --> 02:10:31.525]  Earlier I read an article about how the average person does not care about the war and is sick of hearing about the war.
[02:10:31.525 --> 02:10:33.286]  That's out of the Associated Press.
[02:10:33.286 --> 02:10:36.048]  Americans too not of Afghan war as fighting rages on.
[02:10:36.048 --> 02:10:37.889]  Let's get something straight.
[02:10:37.889 --> 02:10:43.373]  These people that run over when they see somebody in a uniform and say, oh, thank you so much for your service and all this.
[02:10:43.373 --> 02:10:44.634]  That's something they do
[02:10:46.633 --> 02:10:50.276]  That they think the troops want to hear.
[02:10:50.276 --> 02:10:52.498]  And some of them do it for good reasons.
[02:10:52.498 --> 02:10:56.181]  A lot of them do it just because it makes them feel politically correct and good.
[02:10:56.181 --> 02:10:59.223]  Like the women winning the volleyball thing, always thanking the troops.
[02:10:59.223 --> 02:11:07.289]  Now I'd be shocked if she said, and let's get, you know, the troops their pensions that were stolen by Prudential.
[02:11:07.289 --> 02:11:08.430]  They don't have a new hero.
[02:11:08.430 --> 02:11:11.733]  Because if you're actually going to care about somebody, you better actually know what help they need.
[02:11:11.733 --> 02:11:15.276]  That's why when I'm in an airport on the street and people come over to guys in uniform,
[02:11:16.896 --> 02:11:24.139]  Maybe if they're new recruits, privates, they like it, but you can see if it's a sergeant or somebody that's been in a long time, and the people come over, they're like, oh, thank you.
[02:11:24.139 --> 02:11:25.780]  You can tell it's like a punch in the stomach.
[02:11:25.780 --> 02:11:28.121]  They don't want to hear how great they are.
[02:11:28.121 --> 02:11:29.942]  They've been over there growing opium.
[02:11:29.942 --> 02:11:32.463]  They've been over there cleaning up little kids' guts.
[02:11:32.463 --> 02:11:38.025]  They've been over there watching people get fragged who speak out against al-Qaeda being run by the West.
[02:11:38.025 --> 02:11:40.486]  They know Pat Tillman was murdered by the government.
[02:11:40.486 --> 02:11:43.147]  They don't want you telling them how great they are, okay?
[02:11:43.147 --> 02:11:44.928]  Let me just give you a little newsflash, okay?
[02:11:46.142 --> 02:11:48.044]  Let me just give you a little newsflash.
[02:11:48.044 --> 02:12:04.156]  When they go to the local football game, and they're in plainclothes, and the principal comes out and talks about it, everybody points at him, using them for a propaganda point, because the principal and the coach likes to play like they're army PSYOP officers and promote the war effort, like America is really in a war.
[02:12:04.156 --> 02:12:08.580]  America's in a war with globalists that took it over, not against a bunch of jihadis the globalists run.
[02:12:08.580 --> 02:12:12.082]  Let me tell you, the tribes don't like that.
[02:12:12.082 --> 02:12:12.603]  Okay?
[02:12:12.603 --> 02:12:13.904]  They don't like it, I know them.
[02:12:18.797 --> 02:12:21.298]  But let me just get something straight to everybody.
[02:12:21.298 --> 02:12:29.942]  The New World Order hates the military, and they hate conservatives and libertarians and constitutionalists, and all their manuals show that, that we broke.
[02:12:29.942 --> 02:12:32.403]  That the media admits are real.
[02:12:32.403 --> 02:12:34.964]  And the military's depressed training for urban warfare.
[02:12:34.964 --> 02:12:38.585]  They're depressed training to put political dissidents in jail.
[02:12:38.585 --> 02:12:42.327]  They're depressed training for re-education camps, declassified in America.
[02:12:42.327 --> 02:12:43.748]  You'd think that'd be big news.
[02:12:43.748 --> 02:12:46.429]  Three months later, it hadn't been in any mainstream news.
[02:12:51.658 --> 02:12:59.402]  You think that the media would be forced to cover something like that.
[02:12:59.402 --> 02:13:00.962]  So let's get something straight.
[02:13:00.962 --> 02:13:12.287]  Our government, for at least, at least 70 years, has tested on our troops and killed them in countless declassified studies.
[02:13:12.287 --> 02:13:15.869]  Radiation, biologicals, chems, everything.
[02:13:20.959 --> 02:13:28.221]  Again, my dad told the story, he was asking a professor at UT in biology, why don't they use pigs and monkeys for these nuclear tests?
[02:13:28.221 --> 02:13:29.241]  Why do they use soldiers?
[02:13:29.241 --> 02:13:39.224]  And the professor looked at him and said, because soldiers are cheaper than pigs and monkeys.
[02:13:39.224 --> 02:13:41.844]  The globalists are bound in one thing.
[02:13:41.844 --> 02:13:48.426]  They look at all of us as dumb, pathetic animals, as cattle, as scum, as meat on the table to be eaten.
[02:13:50.728 --> 02:13:52.569]  They are a culture across the board.
[02:13:52.569 --> 02:14:06.576]  The Chinese elite, the European elite, the North American elite, African elite, Latin American elite, Jewish elite, Japanese elite.
[02:14:06.576 --> 02:14:07.776]  They're all the same.
[02:14:07.776 --> 02:14:11.058]  They compete with each other over who's the most ruthless.
[02:14:11.058 --> 02:14:13.519]  That's what Machiavelli's all about.
[02:14:13.519 --> 02:14:19.822]  And when you sit here like a naive child, or people almost think it's a form of hospitality to be chumps.
[02:14:21.274 --> 02:14:24.675]  That it's a form of hospitality.
[02:14:24.675 --> 02:14:31.318]  To be run over, to be abused, to be used.
[02:14:31.318 --> 02:14:33.659]  They think it's cute.
[02:14:33.659 --> 02:14:34.500]  They think it's cool.
[02:14:34.500 --> 02:14:37.361]  They think it's fun.
[02:14:37.361 --> 02:14:39.862]  Because they're delusional.
[02:14:39.862 --> 02:14:44.364]  People think that if they imagine something, it's not like, what is, but what is public opinion?
[02:14:45.336 --> 02:14:46.557]  It's not like, what is the right thing to do?
[02:14:46.557 --> 02:14:48.879]  It's like, what are other people doing?
[02:14:48.879 --> 02:14:57.806]  And once you get into that pack mode of, like, lemmings going off the edge of a cliff, and we're a higher order of life, folks, than lemmings and sheep.
[02:14:57.806 --> 02:14:58.766]  I've watched it myself.
[02:14:58.766 --> 02:15:03.530]  I'll be going to an airport and opt out of the scanner, and 20 people behind me will opt out.
[02:15:03.530 --> 02:15:07.653]  But if I sit there and watch and nobody's opting out, nobody opts out.
[02:15:07.653 --> 02:15:12.377]  I mean, that's scary, folks, that you can opt out, that everybody behind you is going to opt out.
[02:15:14.898 --> 02:15:18.239]  By the way, they'd have to stop the whole line if everybody opted out.
[02:15:18.239 --> 02:15:22.181]  That's why when we were going to have National Opt Out Day, they shut it down for a week and searched nobody.
[02:15:22.181 --> 02:15:24.382]  Because they didn't want you to see the power you had.
[02:15:24.382 --> 02:15:26.523]  Do we have that clip ready?
[02:15:26.523 --> 02:15:27.083]  Here's a clip.
[02:15:27.083 --> 02:15:28.184]  Is it Bugs Life or Ants?
[02:15:28.184 --> 02:15:33.046]  I forget the name.
[02:15:33.046 --> 02:15:33.946]  Oh, Ants.
[02:15:39.813 --> 02:15:41.393]  I mean, they know what they're doing.
[02:15:41.393 --> 02:15:42.474]  So let's get this straight.
[02:15:42.474 --> 02:16:00.779]  The people running things are eugenicists, which is a scientific amalgamation of basically a psychopathic religion, because it's really a religion, that they're the elite god class who will ascend and get all the high tech, and we're animals who are too dumb and we're going to be killed.
[02:16:00.779 --> 02:16:04.120]  That is the heart of the New World Order.
[02:16:04.120 --> 02:16:07.340]  That is what the New World Order stands for.
[02:16:07.340 --> 02:16:09.281]  That's what the New World Order is.
[02:16:15.206 --> 02:16:19.313]  And people are like, oh just be positive about it, it'll be okay.
[02:16:19.313 --> 02:16:20.876]  No, the whole thing is sinister.
[02:16:20.876 --> 02:16:22.178]  The whole thing is abusive.
[02:16:22.178 --> 02:16:23.660]  The whole thing is evil.
[02:16:23.660 --> 02:16:25.804]  Evil, evil, evil people.
[02:16:25.804 --> 02:16:27.887]  Wicked beyond imagination are in control.
[02:16:29.022 --> 02:16:30.983]  And there's still a lot of good people.
[02:16:30.983 --> 02:16:35.945]  We still have our basic morals that torture is wrong, secret arrest is wrong, warrantless wiretapping is wrong.
[02:16:35.945 --> 02:16:43.367]  But you notice the system just keeps promoting it like it's good and putting heroes on TV that do it so that their own minions will then carry it out.
[02:16:43.367 --> 02:16:51.670]  It doesn't matter if they commit suicide down the road because you give them drugs that make them commit suicide.
[02:16:51.670 --> 02:16:53.591]  They know what they're doing.
[02:16:58.933 --> 02:17:04.716]  They're fully aware of what they're doing.
[02:17:04.716 --> 02:17:12.161]  And now they're coming out with nasal sprays with these hardcore chemicals that basically mind wipe the troops.
[02:17:12.161 --> 02:17:14.402]  They're giving them amnesiacs.
[02:17:14.402 --> 02:17:16.884]  They're giving them amphetamines.
[02:17:16.884 --> 02:17:21.907]  They're giving them everything.
[02:17:21.907 --> 02:17:24.268]  And of course, it's only gonna make the suicide worse.
[02:17:24.268 --> 02:17:24.869]  But now,
[02:17:26.172 --> 02:17:34.434]  They're trying to absolutely end free will, and they just roll out and say, you don't expect if they're going to inject you with a virus or even spray it on you.
[02:17:34.434 --> 02:17:37.775]  They want people to opt in first to be able to study them.
[02:17:37.775 --> 02:17:42.736]  See, they're setting the precedent where they can give us drugs and things that openly kill us, and then nobody gets in trouble.
[02:17:42.736 --> 02:17:46.877]  Oh, we gave millions of hemophiliacs a drug that we knew had HIV and hepatitis in it.
[02:17:46.877 --> 02:17:53.219]  Big deal, nobody gets in trouble.
[02:17:53.219 --> 02:17:53.759]  Oh, big deal.
[02:17:55.407 --> 02:17:57.988]  And now they come out and go, we got an antristress vaccine.
[02:17:57.988 --> 02:17:59.788]  You'll never be upset again.
[02:17:59.788 --> 02:18:02.589]  Yeah, because you're going to be an emotional zombie.
[02:18:02.589 --> 02:18:05.310]  But they just report it like it's, oh, look, we got a new shot.
[02:18:05.310 --> 02:18:07.410]  You'll never be depressed again.
[02:18:07.410 --> 02:18:09.231]  They're already testing this on the troops.
[02:18:09.231 --> 02:18:11.132]  I've confirmed it.
[02:18:11.132 --> 02:18:16.033]  People are coming home, folks, and they do whatever their wife tells them.
[02:18:16.033 --> 02:18:17.653]  They don't have fun at the football game anymore.
[02:18:17.653 --> 02:18:18.814]  They're not even human anymore.
[02:18:18.814 --> 02:18:22.195]  They just sit there and, Bob, go mow the yard.
[02:18:22.195 --> 02:18:22.695]  Yes, ma'am.
[02:18:26.263 --> 02:18:31.644]  Bob, stick your hand in the light switch.
[02:18:31.644 --> 02:18:33.384]  We're gonna go out to break with a clip from Bugs Life.
[02:18:33.384 --> 02:18:35.765]  Here it is.
[02:18:35.765 --> 02:18:38.105]  It's just one ant!
[02:18:38.105 --> 02:18:40.426]  Yeah, boss, they're puny!
[02:18:40.426 --> 02:18:42.286]  Hmm, puny?
[02:18:42.286 --> 02:18:47.727]  Say, let's pretend this brain is a puny little ant.
[02:18:47.727 --> 02:18:48.207]  Did that hurt?
[02:18:48.207 --> 02:18:49.868]  Nope.
[02:18:49.868 --> 02:18:51.928]  Well, how about this one?
[02:18:51.928 --> 02:18:54.789]  Are you kidding?
[02:18:54.789 --> 02:18:55.289]  How about this?
[02:19:08.157 --> 02:19:14.021]  You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
[02:19:14.021 --> 02:19:18.825]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[02:19:18.825 --> 02:19:23.488]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life!
[02:19:23.488 --> 02:19:25.389]  It's not about food.
[02:19:25.389 --> 02:19:28.732]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[02:19:28.732 --> 02:19:31.614]  That's why we're going back!
[02:19:31.614 --> 02:19:33.295]  Does anybody else want to stay?
[02:19:44.435 --> 02:19:47.480]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we'll come right back.
[02:19:47.480 --> 02:19:52.287]  That's what the TSA groping your daughter and your children's about while they openly run Al-Qaeda.
[02:19:52.287 --> 02:19:54.149]  That's what the checkpoints are about.
[02:19:54.149 --> 02:19:56.773]  That's what the school zero tolerance is about.
[02:19:56.773 --> 02:19:58.395]  That's why they ship drugs in.
[02:19:58.395 --> 02:19:59.557]  To destroy you.
[02:19:59.557 --> 02:20:00.398]  To dominate you.
[02:20:01.059 --> 02:20:07.204]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[02:20:07.204 --> 02:20:10.167]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[02:20:10.167 --> 02:20:15.551]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[02:20:15.551 --> 02:20:20.235]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[02:20:20.515 --> 02:20:28.182]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods Direct now.
[02:20:28.182 --> 02:20:32.066]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[02:20:32.066 --> 02:20:33.848]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:20:33.848 --> 02:20:37.871]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we have all known this was coming.
[02:20:37.871 --> 02:20:40.474]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[02:20:40.754 --> 02:20:43.535]  The fact is, you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[02:20:43.535 --> 02:20:48.098]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[02:20:48.098 --> 02:20:48.758]  Don't wait!
[02:20:48.758 --> 02:20:54.641]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.

[02:22:59.602 --> 02:23:02.783]  What's the difference in all these online emergency food stores?
[02:23:02.783 --> 02:23:04.203]  The difference is Deseret.

[02:23:56.085 --> 02:23:56.945]  Atwood Rope.
[02:23:56.945 --> 02:23:58.846]  Working to keep the world tied together.
[02:24:11.260 --> 02:24:20.885]  Well, there's a new demonization effort out, all part of the larger, flipping the script, from Al-Qaeda is gonna get you, so we've gotta take all your rights too.
[02:24:20.885 --> 02:24:21.745]  Oh, guess what?
[02:24:21.745 --> 02:24:30.830]  This whole Homeland Security architecture was set up for veterans, gun owners, libertarians, conservatives, and people that don't like the new global government.
[02:24:30.830 --> 02:24:33.391]  That's right, it does exist.
[02:24:33.391 --> 02:24:38.234]  After they told us it didn't, and now it does, and now we're gonna arrest you if you don't like it.
[02:24:38.934 --> 02:24:42.215]  And we're going to shut off your power plants, Agenda 21.
[02:24:42.215 --> 02:24:47.897]  And we're going to take over and we're going to grab your 10-year-olds and teach them how to be perverts in the public schools.
[02:24:47.897 --> 02:24:58.301]  And we're going to take your kids for abortions without parental consent and give them vaccines without it, even though that's illegal, because we're the big fat criminal government that took over.
[02:24:58.301 --> 02:25:02.302]  And now Kurt Nemo has the article, Government Hypes White Supremacists
[02:25:04.366 --> 02:25:06.969]  Racial holy war in effort to demonize veterans.
[02:25:06.969 --> 02:25:07.970]  That's right.
[02:25:07.970 --> 02:25:10.853]  The veterans are going to start a holy racial war.
[02:25:10.853 --> 02:25:12.935]  You saw the last Army report they're giving the troops.
[02:25:14.594 --> 02:25:16.975]  The Tea Party is working with Al-Qaeda.
[02:25:16.975 --> 02:25:18.456]  Yes, yes.
[02:25:18.456 --> 02:25:21.178]  The Tea Party is going to link up with Al-Qaeda.
[02:25:21.178 --> 02:25:22.118]  Oh, yes.
[02:25:22.118 --> 02:25:23.879]  So you better go after them, police.
[02:25:23.879 --> 02:25:27.321]  And then, of course, the Tea Party will start not liking police.
[02:25:27.321 --> 02:25:28.622]  And they happen to be gun owners.
[02:25:28.622 --> 02:25:30.503]  And so there'll be confrontations.
[02:25:30.503 --> 02:25:33.045]  And voila!
[02:25:33.045 --> 02:25:35.586]  See, I told you when all this was being planned in secret this was coming.
[02:25:35.586 --> 02:25:37.948]  I said they would say, Tea Party works with Al-Qaeda.
[02:25:37.948 --> 02:25:39.529]  I told you that four years ago.
[02:25:39.529 --> 02:25:40.829]  The Tea Party first started.
[02:25:40.829 --> 02:25:42.470]  And you now see it.
[02:25:42.470 --> 02:25:43.191]  Mainstream news.
[02:25:44.338 --> 02:25:47.920]  And I remember seeing the internal TSA training videos, Homeland Security videos.
[02:25:47.920 --> 02:25:48.661]  We were sent.
[02:25:48.661 --> 02:25:49.901]  We showed them here on air.
[02:25:49.901 --> 02:25:52.303]  And it was all, white people are the terrorists.
[02:25:52.303 --> 02:25:53.824]  They will be attacking.
[02:25:53.824 --> 02:25:56.926]  They're the type that believe in rural rights and the Second Amendment.
[02:25:56.926 --> 02:25:59.447]  They want to kill you, officers.
[02:25:59.447 --> 02:26:01.248]  The police, you know you've all been getting this.
[02:26:01.248 --> 02:26:07.052]  And now there's the public rollout, which means they're getting ready to go operational.
[02:26:09.423 --> 02:26:12.624]  Releasing people out of their psychiatric wards?
[02:26:12.624 --> 02:26:14.144]  Wound up!
[02:26:14.144 --> 02:26:15.724]  I always call them wind-up toys.
[02:26:15.724 --> 02:26:18.685]  These guys, they mind control, and then roll out to do a mass shooting.
[02:26:18.685 --> 02:26:22.966]  They even call them wind-up toys in the Bourne Legacy.
[02:26:22.966 --> 02:26:24.546]  I tell you, that movie.
[02:26:24.546 --> 02:26:29.587]  That screenwriter, that screenwriter, this is unbelievable.
[02:26:29.587 --> 02:26:32.407]  Because that's real, folks.
[02:26:32.407 --> 02:26:33.187]  Wow.
[02:26:33.187 --> 02:26:34.988]  Oh, but again, I mentioned this earlier.
[02:26:34.988 --> 02:26:35.908]  I told you this was coming.
[02:26:37.421 --> 02:26:38.502]  This is out of Reuters.
[02:26:38.502 --> 02:26:45.607]  They want to make you start having all the new cars with robots that watch you and listen to you inside the dash, and a camera hooked up to the police.
[02:26:45.607 --> 02:26:47.609]  Toyota said this about seven years ago, but now it's coming.
[02:26:47.609 --> 02:26:51.972]  And then they track you by the mile and tax you, but for your safety you can hit a button.
[02:26:51.972 --> 02:26:54.394]  It's like OnStar, basically mandatory for everybody.
[02:26:54.394 --> 02:26:56.716]  Government Star, just I guess it is government motors.
[02:26:57.336 --> 02:27:00.941]  And you admit the FBI listens to you without warrants, but it's fine.
[02:27:00.941 --> 02:27:09.773]  And then it will actually shout orders or then take control of the car because they're proving, they say, as I told you they would do, the Google cars are safer.
[02:27:09.773 --> 02:27:11.655]  So see, you can't drive, it's public safety.
[02:27:15.436 --> 02:27:18.158]  But you could pay extra insurance and maybe drive.
[02:27:18.158 --> 02:27:19.339]  For now.
[02:27:19.339 --> 02:27:24.322]  And all the new tech, as the CIA director told you, has stuff wired into it, watching you, tracking you.
[02:27:24.322 --> 02:27:39.394]  Smart meters, they now admit, interfacing with the stuff in your house, all spying on you, all criminal, all seamlessly integrated by the Fortune 100, who openly meet at Bilderberg, and openly are announcing world government, and that they run Al-Qaeda in CFR Magazine last week.
[02:27:40.074 --> 02:27:40.975]  Two weeks ago.
[02:27:40.975 --> 02:27:46.639]  I mean, it's just all in your face, world government, total insanity.
[02:27:46.639 --> 02:27:54.365]  Dan Bodondi, working as one of the radio producers and video switchers in there, did an excellent job, along with John Bowne, Chris Salonese, and others.
[02:27:54.365 --> 02:27:55.086]  He just ran in with this.
[02:27:55.086 --> 02:27:56.347]  He said, yeah, it's all over the place.
[02:27:56.347 --> 02:27:59.529]  Look, vets feel abandoned after secret drug experiments.
[02:27:59.529 --> 02:28:01.911]  Oh, CNN.
[02:28:01.911 --> 02:28:03.933]  Now they just don't make them secret.
[02:28:03.933 --> 02:28:06.975]  Oh, they have a new nasal spray that wipes their conscience.
[02:28:07.975 --> 02:28:12.797]  And it helps them kill better, and then they give them an amnesia.
[02:28:12.797 --> 02:28:15.478]  Because they admit they go to villages and kill everyone.
[02:28:15.478 --> 02:28:18.560]  That's been in the Ithaca Times, Fox News, and they say that's a good thing.
[02:28:18.560 --> 02:28:20.761]  But the troops don't feel good, even though they were told it was good.
[02:28:20.761 --> 02:28:21.361]  It doesn't matter.
[02:28:21.361 --> 02:28:26.524]  They've got a cocktail of several drugs, one of them Halcyon, it's a name I can remember.
[02:28:26.524 --> 02:28:31.466]  It's the drug they give you where it's partial sedation, where they give it to you and rip your wisdom teeth out, and you don't even remember it?
[02:28:32.227 --> 02:28:36.992]  You can tell somebody on Halcyon, hey, go into your house and give me your money.
[02:28:36.992 --> 02:28:39.315]  It's basically like devil's breath.
[02:28:39.315 --> 02:28:41.337]  Oh, jump off the cliff.
[02:28:41.337 --> 02:28:41.638]  Yeah.
[02:28:44.892 --> 02:28:45.633]  My dad's a dentist.
[02:28:45.633 --> 02:28:47.454]  I've seen people assisting him doing wisdom teeth.
[02:29:15.573 --> 02:29:19.997]  After they were given Halcyon and then shocked, but then some of the technicians told him about it.
[02:29:19.997 --> 02:29:20.617]  Oh yeah!
[02:29:20.617 --> 02:29:21.438]  Oh yeah!
[02:29:21.438 --> 02:29:25.182]  Nothing like running blue lightning across the frontal lobe of the troops.
[02:29:25.182 --> 02:29:28.445]  And then they're a little depressed when their IQ goes down.
[02:29:28.445 --> 02:29:30.827]  We'll just put you on Prozac to make you commit suicide.
[02:29:30.827 --> 02:29:32.849]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[02:29:32.849 --> 02:29:33.529]  Yeah!
[02:29:34.266 --> 02:29:35.446]  Yeah!
[02:29:35.446 --> 02:29:38.308]  That's how you support the troops!
[02:29:38.308 --> 02:29:39.088]  That's right!
[02:29:39.088 --> 02:29:40.689]  The government wouldn't hurt us!
[02:29:40.689 --> 02:29:42.469]  They wouldn't do 9-11!
[02:29:42.469 --> 02:29:44.390]  They just killed 4,000 plus U.S.
[02:29:44.390 --> 02:29:46.471]  foster children in radiation experiments!
[02:29:46.471 --> 02:29:48.291]  It's on the Department of Energy's website!
[02:29:48.291 --> 02:29:50.272]  But they wouldn't hurt us!
[02:29:50.272 --> 02:29:51.673]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.673 --> 02:29:54.214]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.214 --> 02:29:56.895]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.934 --> 02:30:04.396]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.
[02:30:04.396 --> 02:30:10.319]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[02:30:10.319 --> 02:30:16.923]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[02:30:16.923 --> 02:30:22.606]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[02:30:22.606 --> 02:30:26.248]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[02:30:26.448 --> 02:30:30.229]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[02:30:30.229 --> 02:30:34.850]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.
[02:30:34.850 --> 02:30:37.330]  You'll also find it at Infowarshop.com.
[02:30:37.330 --> 02:30:41.191]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[02:30:41.191 --> 02:30:45.632]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21, by Rosa Corey.
[02:30:45.632 --> 02:30:48.253]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[02:30:48.573 --> 02:30:55.416]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[02:30:55.416 --> 02:31:01.739]  These titles and a lot more are all available at InfoWarshop.com.
[02:31:01.739 --> 02:31:16.186]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:31:17.202 --> 02:31:21.904]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:21.904 --> 02:31:34.668]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:31:34.668 --> 02:31:41.931]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:31:42.631 --> 02:31:52.998]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:31:52.998 --> 02:31:56.921]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[02:31:56.921 --> 02:32:00.043]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[02:32:00.603 --> 02:32:06.748]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[02:32:06.748 --> 02:32:09.731]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[02:32:09.731 --> 02:32:15.116]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[02:32:15.116 --> 02:32:20.080]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[02:32:20.080 --> 02:32:27.346]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods or meat foods direct now.
[02:32:27.706 --> 02:32:31.569]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[02:32:31.569 --> 02:32:33.371]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:32:33.371 --> 02:32:37.374]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we have all known this was coming.
[02:32:37.374 --> 02:32:40.296]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[02:32:40.296 --> 02:32:43.078]  The fact is you can eat at any time to save money today.
[02:32:43.078 --> 02:32:47.642]  And because it stores for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[02:32:47.642 --> 02:32:48.302]  Don't wait!
[02:32:48.302 --> 02:32:49.783]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:32:49.783 --> 02:32:50.044]  Call 800-409-5633.
[02:32:55.788 --> 02:32:58.031]  Or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:32:58.031 --> 02:32:59.834]  You can bet your life on efoods direct.
[02:33:39.035 --> 02:33:40.896]  Yeah, words are very unnecessary.
[02:33:40.896 --> 02:33:42.357]  We know we're living in tyranny.
[02:33:42.357 --> 02:33:45.878]  A couple other news items here that I wanted to hit.
[02:33:45.878 --> 02:33:50.040]  When I see an article like this, this is how my brain works, I remember the connections to it.
[02:33:50.040 --> 02:33:53.362]  Because they always come out and announce these tyrannies like it was just invented.
[02:33:53.362 --> 02:33:57.803]  Like, we're the first to have special forces run checkpoints in our town.
[02:33:57.803 --> 02:34:01.105]  You mean the first of 10,000 that have already had it done?
[02:34:01.105 --> 02:34:03.346]  This is out of Dartmouth newspaper.
[02:34:03.346 --> 02:34:05.427]  Dartmouth researchers developed smart bracelets.
[02:34:06.207 --> 02:34:09.549]  To track people's medical and brain waves and everything.
[02:34:09.549 --> 02:34:13.131]  Uh, well yeah, and then we happen to have the backstory.
[02:34:13.131 --> 02:34:17.213]  Bill Gates magic boredom measuring bracelets.
[02:34:17.213 --> 02:34:23.116]  They want for public school children to track their heart rate, brain rate, and everything else, so teachers can know if they're paying attention.
[02:34:24.326 --> 02:34:27.328]  This is all part of the medicalization mind control takeover.
[02:34:27.328 --> 02:34:35.294]  This guy is over researching the GMO at Monsanto he owns part of on how to engineer GMO to create gut problems.
[02:34:35.294 --> 02:34:39.737]  Then he dominates creating cures for the gut problems.
[02:34:39.737 --> 02:34:43.199]  All the gut flora problems that GMO is causing.
[02:34:43.199 --> 02:34:46.141]  He's also involved in weather weapons.
[02:34:46.141 --> 02:34:49.383]  He gets tax money and then he runs the companies that do it.
[02:34:49.383 --> 02:34:52.526]  You just look up, they just dumped a bunch of sulfur dioxide on New Mexico.
[02:34:53.386 --> 02:34:54.507]  In one of his big studies.
[02:34:54.507 --> 02:34:57.049]  I mean, this is a lunatic control freak.
[02:34:57.049 --> 02:34:58.510]  So I thought I would just mention that.
[02:34:58.510 --> 02:34:59.210]  And again, U.S.
[02:34:59.210 --> 02:35:03.333]  testing talking cars to avoid crashes and congestion.
[02:35:03.333 --> 02:35:10.178]  What they are is cars that surveil you with the police tracking you and taxing you and taking control of your car.
[02:35:10.178 --> 02:35:12.299]  That's where everything's moving.
[02:35:12.299 --> 02:35:15.341]  And now there it is in Reuters.
[02:35:15.341 --> 02:35:15.842]  Here's another one.
[02:35:15.842 --> 02:35:18.623]  Robot to throw the first pitch at Detroit Tigers game.
[02:35:18.623 --> 02:35:20.265]  We're not against technology.
[02:35:21.277 --> 02:35:27.100]  But the problem here is that it's all being backdoor engineered with Trojan horses to control us.
[02:35:27.100 --> 02:35:31.001]  They're now coming out with synthetic ground police robots.
[02:35:31.001 --> 02:35:31.982]  They'll follow orders.
[02:35:31.982 --> 02:35:34.223]  They'll kill unarmed people.
[02:35:34.223 --> 02:35:38.685]  They're coming out with autonomous drones that humans don't control, that the globalists can program.
[02:35:38.685 --> 02:35:44.688]  They've said at MIT and DARPA, the globalists that run our country, that this is what they want.
[02:35:44.688 --> 02:35:45.848]  Humans out of the equation.
[02:35:45.848 --> 02:35:49.350]  Bill Joy said, 12 years ago, he said, owners of some microsystems.
[02:35:50.407 --> 02:35:58.176]  He said, I was at a meeting with 200 top tech people and owners, billionaires, and we discussed, do we kill everybody?
[02:35:58.176 --> 02:36:02.442]  Or do we just let them kind of play games and have fun and let robots run everything?
[02:36:02.442 --> 02:36:05.085]  And the consensus was, we're probably just going to kill everybody.
[02:36:07.082 --> 02:36:10.863]  And then he quotes the Unabomber who'd been in CIA mind control.
[02:36:10.863 --> 02:36:11.783]  That's LA Times.
[02:36:11.783 --> 02:36:14.204]  Theodore Kaczynski was in the MKUltra program.
[02:36:14.204 --> 02:36:15.625]  This stuff's real.
[02:36:15.625 --> 02:36:17.365]  And he starts quoting him.
[02:36:17.365 --> 02:36:21.706]  That's why Kaczynski went wild and was actually in his writings saying this was all coming.
[02:36:21.706 --> 02:36:24.207]  I mean, this is the big enchilada.
[02:36:24.207 --> 02:36:25.087]  This is the big issue.
[02:36:25.087 --> 02:36:26.168]  Now, shifting gears.
[02:36:27.328 --> 02:36:41.038]  We have the Executive Director of Channel Austin, what has been AXS Television in Austin, Linda Lutowski, who I've known, I don't know, for about a decade or so, for the 40th anniversary of AXS Television.
[02:36:41.038 --> 02:36:44.140]  And AXS began in Austin, Texas, so this is important everywhere.
[02:36:44.140 --> 02:36:45.981]  We'll give you a few tips here on air.
[02:36:45.981 --> 02:36:51.465]  I started out in 1995, going and taking the classes and stuff, got on air in, I guess,
[02:36:52.381 --> 02:36:56.528]  Because I was only on to the people's shows until 96, as a producer in 96.
[02:36:56.528 --> 02:36:58.030]  Six months later, got a radio show.
[02:36:58.030 --> 02:36:59.432]  A year later, got syndicated.
[02:36:59.432 --> 02:37:02.157]  But I stayed still on access until about six, seven years ago.
[02:37:02.157 --> 02:37:05.182]  I'd go down there some, but 20, 30 fans would show up.
[02:37:05.182 --> 02:37:06.323]  And so I just couldn't be there anymore.
[02:37:07.552 --> 02:37:21.278]  Well, we use it as a studio sometimes, great folks, but even though I was pretty much gone seven, eight years ago, I discovered, and I'm going to talk about this first, Linda, I discovered, because she hadn't been there in years, she'd been there early on, that there was fraud going on.
[02:37:21.278 --> 02:37:27.381]  They were bringing in enough money to run it, but claiming they were going to shut it down, basically with operatives in government and media that wanted it gone.
[02:37:28.294 --> 02:37:35.060]  And I basically ran an investigation on them, recorded them, did some stuff, and we sent the director to prison.
[02:37:35.060 --> 02:37:39.004]  But it went a lot higher than that, but the investigation got killed because it was city run.
[02:37:39.004 --> 02:37:45.109]  Now, Linda, you know, came in, cleaned the whole thing up, stopped the violation of our First Amendment and all the things that were going on.
[02:37:45.109 --> 02:37:46.511]  It was pretty darn sorted.
[02:37:47.231 --> 02:37:58.565]  They're trying to get rid of it now, basically, but I wanted to advertise that if you want to go somewhere and immediately air documentaries, clips of things, do your own show, don't want to be on there, just put an image up, talk over it, get down there.
[02:37:58.565 --> 02:38:01.749]  Austin Access has hundreds of thousands of viewers in the aggregate.
[02:38:01.749 --> 02:38:04.612]  You do a show once, it'll air ten times or so after.
[02:38:04.612 --> 02:38:05.994]  We take our nightly news show.
[02:38:06.454 --> 02:38:10.696]  And John Bowne takes it down there as a producer and puts it on as a service to Austin.
[02:38:10.696 --> 02:38:11.736]  Huge viewership.
[02:38:11.736 --> 02:38:17.678]  You need to get down there because the more members it has, they try to run everybody off, but Linda helped keep it together.
[02:38:17.678 --> 02:38:19.979]  The plan was to basically shut it down.
[02:38:19.979 --> 02:38:23.460]  From our analysis, from our research, that's what it looked like was happening.
[02:38:23.460 --> 02:38:25.461]  But just recap for folks.
[02:38:25.461 --> 02:38:29.862]  How many years ago was that that I hired the private investigator and snuck around and caught him?
[02:38:29.862 --> 02:38:33.584]  I believe it started in 2004 and he went on trial 2006.
[02:38:36.021 --> 02:38:41.844]  The City Audit Department ran an investigation based on what you uncovered.
[02:38:41.844 --> 02:38:42.644]  And they found what?
[02:38:42.644 --> 02:38:46.005]  How many hundreds of thousands was it missing?
[02:38:46.005 --> 02:38:47.566]  $352,000 he stole.
[02:38:47.566 --> 02:38:48.426]  Convicted of that?
[02:38:48.426 --> 02:38:49.727]  He was convicted of that.
[02:38:49.727 --> 02:38:55.229]  Seven years to Huntsville Prison, but he only served 15 months.
[02:38:55.229 --> 02:38:57.590]  Huntsville, that's an enjoyable prison in East Texas.
[02:38:57.590 --> 02:38:58.111]  Exactly.
[02:38:58.111 --> 02:38:59.871]  No air conditioning.
[02:38:59.871 --> 02:39:00.632]  Most of the time.
[02:39:01.314 --> 02:39:12.360]  Yeah, but... It was a severe sentence for a white-collar crime, but he was not ordered to pay any restitution, even though this was funds for the community.
[02:39:12.360 --> 02:39:14.081]  He paid nothing in restitution.
[02:39:14.081 --> 02:39:14.741]  Well, you know why?
[02:39:14.741 --> 02:39:22.005]  Because, I mean, the word is, well... Our research shows it was not just him that was involved.
[02:39:22.005 --> 02:39:22.985]  That's true.
[02:39:22.985 --> 02:39:29.509]  The focus of the investigation was on him as a... as that he acted alone, even though there was
[02:39:31.001 --> 02:39:35.825]  There was a lot of speculation that some board members were in on this as well.
[02:39:35.825 --> 02:39:36.765]  Well, it wasn't just that.
[02:39:36.765 --> 02:39:39.768]  It went into the city, and that's why they killed it real quick.
[02:39:39.768 --> 02:39:42.910]  And then once they can say he's an ex-con, then they can try to discredit everything.
[02:39:42.910 --> 02:39:44.932]  But it was pretty amazing.
[02:39:44.932 --> 02:39:50.276]  He actually, at a telecommunications meeting, came up to me and threatened me.
[02:39:51.038 --> 02:39:54.906]  And I said, I said, I said, look what I do to the government every day, buddy.
[02:39:54.906 --> 02:39:55.928]  You think that's going to work?
[02:39:55.928 --> 02:39:57.591]  I said, now I'm coming after you.
[02:39:57.591 --> 02:40:00.678]  That's when I actually pulled the trigger and really, really focused on him.
[02:40:00.678 --> 02:40:02.060]  I was like, you're going to threaten me?
[02:40:03.075 --> 02:40:05.977]  I think without you, Alex, he never would have come down.
[02:40:05.977 --> 02:40:08.258]  I mean, they never would have brought him down.
[02:40:08.258 --> 02:40:13.401]  And I don't believe that the city would have conducted such an in-depth investigation through the auditorium.
[02:40:13.401 --> 02:40:19.545]  Well, I just want to say, people always think these bullies are invincible until you actually confront them.
[02:40:19.545 --> 02:40:23.248]  It's like Fast and Furious or anything, we just got to keep pushing.
[02:40:23.248 --> 02:40:25.409]  But he told me, he said, I will kill you.
[02:40:25.409 --> 02:40:26.510]  And I said, well, go ahead and try.
[02:40:27.230 --> 02:40:28.072]  And I said, that's it!
[02:40:28.072 --> 02:40:29.314]  Now I'm gonna get ya!
[02:40:29.314 --> 02:40:32.861]  He was an ex-Marine and a bookkeeper and it was kind of...
[02:40:34.033 --> 02:40:37.115]  An unusual circumstance that he was actually running the place.
[02:40:37.115 --> 02:40:39.036]  See, I use violence of info war.
[02:40:39.036 --> 02:40:42.438]  And I told him, I said, I said, now I'm coming after you.
[02:40:42.438 --> 02:40:43.019]  And you did.
[02:40:43.019 --> 02:40:45.240]  I mean, you went before city council.
[02:40:45.240 --> 02:40:47.882]  You went before the Telecommunications Commission.
[02:40:47.882 --> 02:40:48.862]  You made it public.
[02:40:48.862 --> 02:40:50.183]  You brought it into the light.
[02:40:50.183 --> 02:40:56.107]  And I think people were it was I guess it was your power or your.
[02:40:57.841 --> 02:40:58.462]  Well, it's not even that.
[02:40:58.462 --> 02:40:59.964]  It's just the power of light on it.
[02:40:59.964 --> 02:41:03.548]  Yeah, it was your celebrity, your notoriety, your reputation.
[02:41:03.548 --> 02:41:06.612]  Those, all of those things added up to make it happen.
[02:41:06.612 --> 02:41:08.234]  That's... I didn't really follow.
[02:41:08.234 --> 02:41:10.096]  He pled guilty, didn't he, finally?
[02:41:10.096 --> 02:41:12.078]  Um, no, no.
[02:41:12.078 --> 02:41:13.079]  I don't believe he did.
[02:41:13.079 --> 02:41:14.982]  I was just going from memory.
[02:41:14.982 --> 02:41:15.142]  Yeah.
[02:41:16.403 --> 02:41:20.086]  He showed no remorse whatsoever when he was called to testify.
[02:41:20.086 --> 02:41:23.388]  There was a number of us there in the courtroom.
[02:41:23.388 --> 02:41:26.071]  He did not ever say he was sorry.
[02:41:26.071 --> 02:41:29.473]  He never offered to pay anything back.
[02:41:29.473 --> 02:41:33.457]  He used most of the money for like University of Texas football tickets.
[02:41:33.457 --> 02:41:35.618]  He flew to all the away games.
[02:41:35.618 --> 02:41:39.241]  He had cable and he bought a house and I mean all sorts of stuff.
[02:41:39.241 --> 02:41:43.324]  So it was kind of a sad circumstance that you're operating this nonprofit
[02:41:44.065 --> 02:41:50.447]  A corporation that's, you know, helping hundreds if not thousands of people in the community and then you're stealing from it.
[02:41:51.414 --> 02:41:52.074]  That was just sad.
[02:42:16.050 --> 02:42:20.412]  I've got the workers from the show coming in to get us to go on TV, so they had to back off.
[02:42:20.412 --> 02:42:22.153]  That was pretty funny.
[02:42:22.153 --> 02:42:23.894]  That's what these guys do.
[02:42:23.894 --> 02:42:25.435]  They don't understand this goes two ways.
[02:42:25.435 --> 02:42:28.457]  I guess they're just used to the general public.
[02:42:28.457 --> 02:42:29.638]  I wish the public wasn't like that.
[02:42:29.638 --> 02:42:32.119]  When someone threatens them, they just cower down to it.
[02:42:32.119 --> 02:42:34.960]  I immediately just run around like a chicken when my head got off.
[02:42:36.121 --> 02:42:36.801]  Enough about that.
[02:42:36.801 --> 02:42:40.323]  The point is we fought, you fought, that's now eight years ago, hard to believe.
[02:42:40.323 --> 02:42:42.524]  Let me see, six, seven, seven and a half years ago.
[02:42:42.524 --> 02:42:43.964]  So I was right, seven and a half years ago.
[02:42:43.964 --> 02:42:46.045]  Hard to believe time has moved that fast.
[02:42:46.045 --> 02:42:48.266]  They're using other strategies.
[02:42:48.266 --> 02:42:55.329]  I know Time Warner even recently has tried to get my shows off the air, you know, mad about things.
[02:42:55.329 --> 02:42:58.711]  But I mean, you told me about that offer so we could talk about it, but I mean, there's no point.
[02:42:59.611 --> 02:43:01.592]  Everybody should use access all over the country.
[02:43:01.592 --> 02:43:08.254]  Tell people where access is today and where some of the best spots in the country are and how easy it is to get on air.
[02:43:08.254 --> 02:43:11.195]  The very best spot in the whole country is Austin, Texas.
[02:43:11.195 --> 02:43:12.215]  And you're right.
[02:43:12.215 --> 02:43:18.077]  We have the longest continually running public access channel in the universe.
[02:43:18.077 --> 02:43:19.998]  It's where Robert Rodriguez got started.
[02:43:20.498 --> 02:43:25.602]  Rick Linklater and Alex Jones as well as thousands of other people.
[02:43:25.602 --> 02:43:30.025]  We're in the tens of thousands now of folks who've used it over 40 years.
[02:43:30.025 --> 02:43:46.477]  There's also Manhattan has a really strong access center but over 60 public access stations in the state of California have closed their doors and in Texas, Dallas closed their doors because of a lack of information in a federal law.
[02:43:47.037 --> 02:43:53.261]  So basically there is no more support for operations any longer that the public access the non-profit.
[02:43:53.261 --> 02:44:01.185]  And to be clear, if the cable was given a monopoly in the past, a few cents out of the bill would go to give citizens an electronic soapbox.
[02:44:01.185 --> 02:44:02.306]  Exactly, that's true.
[02:44:04.947 --> 02:44:07.189]  C-SPAN came out of that so much more.
[02:44:07.189 --> 02:44:09.170]  That's all going the way of the Gooney Bird.
[02:44:09.170 --> 02:44:10.651]  Because of AT&T.
[02:44:10.651 --> 02:44:19.477]  They did not, when they decided to go into the video service, they did not want to have to go and negotiate with each individual municipality.
[02:44:19.477 --> 02:44:28.583]  And without making you enemies, I mean, even recently they're like, we don't like that, you know, he's got a show already and it's commercial that he's on AXS.
[02:44:28.583 --> 02:44:32.185]  Well yeah, but it's my show, we cut out the ads, my information on AXS.
[02:44:32.185 --> 02:44:32.525]  That's right.
[02:44:32.525 --> 02:44:34.467]  But I mean the point is all over the country they don't want me on.
[02:44:35.868 --> 02:44:41.913]  The thing about public access that's so critical is, one, it's not mainstream media.
[02:44:41.913 --> 02:44:47.077]  You have the First Amendment right to free speech, Alex, and you should be able to say whatever you want.
[02:44:47.077 --> 02:44:49.599]  As long as you don't break any federal, state, or local law.
[02:44:49.599 --> 02:44:54.543]  As long as you don't have a call to action to kill somebody or if you say, hey, come by my car at this address.
[02:44:54.543 --> 02:44:55.464]  Exactly.
[02:44:55.464 --> 02:44:57.926]  Or you don't libel or slander anyone that's proven.
[02:44:58.266 --> 02:45:00.169]  Or you don't put anything obscene on the air.
[02:45:00.169 --> 02:45:03.754]  And that'd have to be adjudicated other than obscene because we have standards for that.
[02:45:03.754 --> 02:45:05.436]  Let's expand on that then.
[02:45:05.436 --> 02:45:09.021]  Tell us the number, the phone number, how easy it is to go down there and get a producer license.
[02:45:09.021 --> 02:45:13.407]  The very best way is to go to our website which is channelaustin.org
[02:45:14.108 --> 02:45:23.050]  You can sign up as a user and then come to our intro session which is an orientation we have every Monday night at 7 p.m.
[02:45:23.050 --> 02:45:28.372]  except holidays and now the first Saturday of every month at 11 a.m.
[02:45:28.372 --> 02:45:33.433]  It lasts about an hour and then you can learn everything you need to know about how to take the training.
[02:45:34.433 --> 02:45:46.956]  How to get certified in the use of millions of dollars worth of equipment you can use absolutely free of charge and borrow it as long as you put the content on the air first and then you can do it.
[02:45:46.956 --> 02:45:53.918]  It's amazing, it's amazing and I want all the Austin Info Warriors to go down there because they're going to try to shut it down next year.
[02:45:53.918 --> 02:45:56.659]  We need to get a bunch of new blood in there because that's what's kept it alive.
[02:45:57.179 --> 02:46:08.486]  And again, I wish that, I know Rick Linklater's a great guy, Rodriguez is, I guess, an okay guy, doesn't like me too much, but the point is, you know, folks like that, I think they should come to the Support of Access because it helped give them a launchpad.
[02:46:08.486 --> 02:46:10.567]  What about other people that need a launchpad?
[02:46:10.567 --> 02:46:12.908]  But not just a launchpad for media, for free speech.
[02:46:12.908 --> 02:46:16.891]  Everybody should use this 40-year venue.
[02:46:16.891 --> 02:46:17.291]  Exactly.
[02:46:17.291 --> 02:46:23.735]  But I think it's funny that the year that the city's trying to shut it down is the year it turns 40, and there's some kind of magic about that.
[02:46:23.735 --> 02:46:24.935]  People aren't going to want to shut it down.
[02:46:24.935 --> 02:46:25.516]  That's correct.
[02:46:26.187 --> 02:46:32.849]  It's unfortunate because all these years everyone said, oh taxpayer dollars are going for these crazy people on this channel.
[02:46:32.849 --> 02:46:35.850]  Why do my taxpayer dollars have to pay for this?
[02:46:35.850 --> 02:46:38.791]  And all these years that was absolutely not true.
[02:46:38.791 --> 02:46:43.552]  Now we have to focus on how we can have sustainable funding to stay alive.
[02:46:43.892 --> 02:46:51.883]  To at least have folks there to help you out, to offer classes, and to bring in other nonprofits that need a platform.
[02:46:51.883 --> 02:46:57.390]  I mean, and have access to a hyper-local distribution on the channel.
[02:46:57.390 --> 02:47:00.895]  So we always see it as something that's about your community,
[02:47:01.435 --> 02:47:04.077]  By your community and for your community.
[02:47:04.077 --> 02:47:08.419]  Sure, and most people that are trying to put stuff on YouTube, they're getting a few thousand views.
[02:47:08.419 --> 02:47:16.464]  I remember more than a decade ago they actually did a Time Warner thing I saw in the Chronicle and it was showing numbers and the one reason they were getting upset about my show that I was doing...
[02:47:17.404 --> 02:47:20.146]  Well, you know, because I had a radio and I was talking about the AXS show as well.
[02:47:20.146 --> 02:47:22.127]  It had sometimes over 100,000 viewers.
[02:47:22.127 --> 02:47:24.588]  And in Austin, that was really freaking people out.
[02:47:24.588 --> 02:47:26.429]  And that was kind of in the heyday of AXS.
[02:47:26.429 --> 02:47:29.370]  But it still has a big audience because people are surfing through.
[02:47:29.370 --> 02:47:33.773]  And if it's, you know, some preacher with bad audio, people just go right through.
[02:47:33.773 --> 02:47:36.534]  But if you're if you're there talking about issues, you can.
[02:47:36.534 --> 02:47:40.476]  And again, there's all sorts of AXS facilities around the country.
[02:47:40.476 --> 02:47:44.719]  You could shoot the video at home, edit it at home, just go play it there because it
[02:47:45.599 --> 02:47:51.142]  It's a venue to reach people that aren't getting their news online, but it's also a way to breathe life into access television.
[02:47:51.142 --> 02:47:51.662]  Exactly.
[02:47:51.662 --> 02:47:54.444]  And we also, now we stream 24-7.
[02:47:54.444 --> 02:47:58.166]  So it's not just your local community, but an international community.
[02:47:58.166 --> 02:48:03.129]  And the thing about you, Alex, is to try and prove a point, you were on in Lakeway.
[02:48:04.149 --> 02:48:16.959]  On a cable, on Time Warner cable in Lakeway, when they took away public access, the channels in Lakeway, we had 200 phone calls in the first hour that your show did not air that day.
[02:48:16.959 --> 02:48:22.464]  And so that gives, I mean to receive that many phone calls flooding the lines is unbelievable.
[02:48:22.464 --> 02:48:25.046]  That's when we knew that people were watching public access.
[02:48:25.586 --> 02:48:26.647]  Because of your show.
[02:48:26.647 --> 02:48:28.209]  And the fact that they took it off the air.
[02:48:28.209 --> 02:48:30.171]  Yeah, and that's just a tiny community outside Austin.
[02:48:30.171 --> 02:48:30.672]  Tiny.
[02:48:30.672 --> 02:48:34.396]  I mean, access used to go into a bunch of communities around us.
[02:48:34.396 --> 02:48:37.179]  But it's just in Austin now, but Austin's gotten so much bigger.
[02:48:37.179 --> 02:48:38.460]  So it's still a huge audience.
[02:48:38.460 --> 02:48:39.001]  That's correct.
[02:48:39.997 --> 02:48:42.560]  Well, so tell us, what's the numbers?
[02:48:42.560 --> 02:48:44.242]  I mean, what's the scoop?
[02:48:44.242 --> 02:48:46.745]  40 years, they're shutting them down everywhere.
[02:48:46.745 --> 02:48:48.867]  Just having a constituency is what keeps them on.
[02:48:48.867 --> 02:48:51.750]  What else can we do to keep Austin Access and others on?
[02:48:51.750 --> 02:48:56.276]  We have a lot of events planned for this year in Austin.
[02:48:56.276 --> 02:49:00.721]  So for your listeners, the folks in Austin, we definitely need support there.
[02:49:01.321 --> 02:49:20.574]  For nationally, we need support from both sides of the aisle to support what's called the CAP Act, which is the Community Access Preservation Act, which we have a bunch of Democrats who have put forward the bill, sponsored the bill, but we only have one... An occasional good thing they've done, that's good.
[02:49:21.094 --> 02:49:22.675]  That's correct.
[02:49:22.675 --> 02:49:29.100]  But it would change three words in a federal law that would allow for operation funds.
[02:49:29.100 --> 02:49:32.242]  So let me just give you an idea in Austin, Texas.
[02:49:32.242 --> 02:49:45.472]  There is 1.2 to 1.8 million dollars a year available through the video providers for use for capital expenditures, but zero for operations.
[02:49:46.172 --> 02:50:00.860]  So, if three words in the national law was changed to read, any, any funds could be used for any purpose, then we would have absolutely the money needed, as would every other access station in the country.
[02:50:01.499 --> 02:50:07.964]  Well, and I think Access, if they have to, you've done a lot of things trying to open it up, getting the streaming on the web, a lot of other community partnerships.
[02:50:07.964 --> 02:50:13.609]  You tried to get those so-called low-watt FMs when the court was saying, hey, you can't have community radio.
[02:50:13.609 --> 02:50:16.431]  They said, okay, we'll get out some little licenses, but they never really gave those out.
[02:50:16.431 --> 02:50:16.871]  That's correct.
[02:50:16.871 --> 02:50:18.553]  Imagine if you guys had a 100-watt FM.
[02:50:19.413 --> 02:50:21.035]  For real community radio as well.
[02:50:21.035 --> 02:50:22.616]  And we are looking at that actually.
[02:50:22.616 --> 02:50:29.443]  Prometheus Radio is saying that they're out of Philadelphia and they help non-profit organizations raise the antenna.
[02:50:29.443 --> 02:50:32.766]  And they are supposed to be releasing some more low-powered licenses.
[02:50:32.766 --> 02:50:35.829]  But instead they gave them all as repeaters to commercial stations.
[02:50:36.129 --> 02:50:36.769]  That's true.
[02:50:36.769 --> 02:50:38.851]  But there are a few left in our zip code.
[02:50:38.851 --> 02:50:39.031]  Yeah.
[02:50:39.031 --> 02:50:40.071]  So we are looking at that.
[02:50:40.071 --> 02:50:45.915]  And again, I'm not against commercial stations getting a, you know, they're an AM getting an FM, but those were slotted for community stations.
[02:50:45.915 --> 02:50:46.616]  That's correct.
[02:50:46.616 --> 02:50:49.417]  My problem is, is they'll end up just being communist stations.
[02:50:49.417 --> 02:50:52.479]  Most community ones turn out to be just communist Ford Foundation stations.
[02:50:52.479 --> 02:50:56.021]  What we need is real access radio stations where it's whoever.
[02:50:56.021 --> 02:50:57.542]  I mean, that's what we need is whoever.
[02:50:57.542 --> 02:50:59.664]  And you watch, those stations will dominate.
[02:50:59.664 --> 02:51:00.064]  We'll be back.
[02:51:02.751 --> 02:51:08.914]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid, and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[02:51:08.914 --> 02:51:14.037]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[02:51:14.037 --> 02:51:16.218]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[02:51:16.218 --> 02:51:23.502]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[02:51:24.002 --> 02:51:27.704]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[02:51:27.704 --> 02:51:31.945]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[02:51:31.945 --> 02:51:38.628]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling Power Hub unit.
[02:51:38.628 --> 02:51:41.609]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[02:51:41.609 --> 02:51:44.630]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[02:51:44.630 --> 02:51:48.252]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar-powered.
[02:51:48.252 --> 02:51:50.693]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[02:51:51.194 --> 02:51:56.188]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[02:51:56.188 --> 02:51:57.792]  That's BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[02:52:01.277 --> 02:52:03.279]  We've lived in this neighborhood for years.
[02:52:03.279 --> 02:52:06.201]  We have an alarm system and all of our doors have deadbolts.
[02:52:06.201 --> 02:52:10.365]  They kicked in our door and were in and out of our house in about 5 minutes.
[02:52:10.365 --> 02:52:16.210]  The police arrived in about 20 minutes, but they were long gone with our TV, jewelry, and my guns.
[02:52:16.210 --> 02:52:19.172]  I kept thinking, what if my family had been home?
[02:52:19.172 --> 02:52:25.798]  The police officer said that more than 85% of break-ins are through a door, and that deadbolts alone don't stop intruders.
[02:52:26.238 --> 02:52:32.582]  The officer told me to go to EZArmor.com if we wanted something that would actually stop an intruder.
[02:52:32.582 --> 02:52:38.827]  EZArmor reinforces all of the weak points on your doors and is guaranteed to prevent kick-ins.
[02:52:38.827 --> 02:52:44.531]  I was surprised at how little EZArmor costs and I installed EZArmor in about 30 minutes.
[02:52:45.091 --> 02:52:46.733]  Visit EasyArmor.com.
[02:52:46.733 --> 02:52:47.714]  That's the letters E-Z-A-R-M-O-R.com.
[02:52:47.714 --> 02:52:49.615]  Or call 888-58-ARMOR.
[02:52:49.615 --> 02:52:49.976]  That's 888-582-7667.
[02:52:49.976 --> 02:52:50.576]  EasyArmor.com.
[02:52:50.576 --> 02:52:51.817]  Ultimate door security made easy.
[02:53:00.475 --> 02:53:01.355]  My name's Bruno.
[02:53:01.355 --> 02:53:02.696]  I'm 52 years old.
[02:53:02.696 --> 02:53:06.337]  I've tried different protein powders over the years, and they've all tasted pretty bad.
[02:53:06.337 --> 02:53:08.618]  I tried One World Way and found it to be delicious.
[02:53:08.618 --> 02:53:14.459]  After 10 weeks on One World Way, my wife commented, you have more muscles and you're leaner than when you were 20 years old.
[02:53:14.459 --> 02:53:16.020]  My body has changed dramatically.
[02:53:16.560 --> 02:53:17.481]  I'm a cyclist.
[02:53:17.481 --> 02:53:20.502]  Normally I'll ride two days on and take two days off.
[02:53:20.502 --> 02:53:30.627]  After being on One World Way, I rode 10 days in a row in over 100 degree heat and then I'd take another two servings of One World Way and then work out at the gym for another hour and a half.
[02:53:30.627 --> 02:53:32.808]  I just couldn't believe these results.
[02:53:32.808 --> 02:53:36.871]  My normal muscle tightness and soreness after working out are virtually gone.
[02:53:36.871 --> 02:53:38.371]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:53:38.371 --> 02:53:40.412]  One World Way comes in single servings.
[02:53:40.412 --> 02:53:41.293]  Just give it a try.
[02:53:41.897 --> 02:53:44.980]  For a health and taste sensation you'll love, call 888-988-3325.
[02:53:44.980 --> 02:53:45.320]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:53:45.320 --> 02:53:45.860]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:53:45.860 --> 02:53:47.642]  Or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[02:53:47.642 --> 02:53:48.543]  That's OneWorld, W-H-E-Y.com.
[02:54:12.688 --> 02:54:19.910]  Linda Lutowski is our guest and we're talking about, well, my roots, where I came from, AXS television.
[02:54:19.910 --> 02:54:21.930]  Incredible venue.
[02:54:21.930 --> 02:54:25.271]  And even if you're in a small town, there's maybe 5,000 subscribers.
[02:54:25.271 --> 02:54:32.633]  Let me tell you, if you've got energy, I see so many people who even have radio shows, they'll go to an AXS show, they go, oh, it's this AXS, they have low energy.
[02:54:33.753 --> 02:54:36.134]  You get out of something what you give.
[02:54:36.134 --> 02:54:39.815]  And I'm telling you, Access Television is an amazing venue.
[02:54:39.815 --> 02:54:41.236]  Use it today.
[02:54:41.236 --> 02:54:44.717]  Again, give us the website and the phone number if people want to go get involved.
[02:54:44.717 --> 02:54:47.738]  It's ChannelAustin.org and our phone number is 512-478-8600.
[02:54:47.738 --> 02:54:49.598]  My extension is 18 and you're welcome to call me.
[02:54:55.180 --> 02:55:06.111]  What we need is hundreds of people to come down there, sign up, and well you can just pay a basic fee and then submit your stuff or take a few classes that are a few nights and then get the equipment, use the computers.
[02:55:06.111 --> 02:55:07.692]  You want to talk about getting in media?
[02:55:07.692 --> 02:55:09.494]  So many parents are spending $100,000 to send their kids to UT.
[02:55:10.515 --> 02:55:10.955]  Exactly.
[02:55:10.955 --> 02:55:13.477]  And then you get out, you're not getting an RTF job probably, okay?
[02:55:13.477 --> 02:55:16.620]  You're not, I mean, you've got a snowball's chance and you know where.
[02:55:16.620 --> 02:55:20.723]  But I'm telling you, if you want to get into newspapers, get a job at a newspaper.
[02:55:20.723 --> 02:55:23.625]  You want to get into TV, get a job, you know, go to an access show.
[02:55:23.625 --> 02:55:24.786]  You want a radio show?
[02:55:24.786 --> 02:55:26.227]  Go volunteer.
[02:55:26.227 --> 02:55:28.529]  Or go pay for an hour if you think you've got it.
[02:55:28.529 --> 02:55:30.190]  They'll start saying, oh, we'll pay you.
[02:55:30.190 --> 02:55:32.872]  Let me tell you, they're looking for talent.
[02:55:32.872 --> 02:55:34.694]  And the message of liberty is popular.
[02:55:35.274 --> 02:55:39.859]  So, the journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step, and here I am 17 years later.
[02:55:39.859 --> 02:55:47.766]  Folks, don't forget, we printed 70,000 of these, 50,000 at the streets of Austin, 20,000 were to be shipped out at cost.
[02:55:47.766 --> 02:55:51.970]  If you buy them at InfoWarshop.com, the new InfoWars magazine.
[02:55:51.970 --> 02:55:53.111]  Guess what?

[02:55:55.353 --> 02:55:56.634]  We're reprinting more today.

[02:56:35.762 --> 02:56:39.943]  InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter right now.
[02:56:39.943 --> 02:56:41.623]  Len Lutowski, any closing comments?
[02:56:41.623 --> 02:56:45.004]  I know you're going to interview me real quick after the show for a documentary you're making.
[02:56:45.004 --> 02:56:45.604]  Tell us about that.
[02:56:46.032 --> 02:56:48.735]  The documentary is called Access This with an Attitude.
[02:56:48.735 --> 02:57:02.291]  It's all about the history of public access in Austin since 1973 and includes folks like you who got started there, who gave us amazing stories about our community and had a voice in free speech.
[02:57:03.789 --> 02:57:06.310]  Now, tell us briefly, what is the time frame?
[02:57:06.310 --> 02:57:10.193]  I mean, it's going to start shutting down, what, in about six, eight months if you don't get support and funds?
[02:57:10.193 --> 02:57:16.796]  Actually, we have about a year left, and then we're under a contract with the city that's year by year.
[02:57:16.796 --> 02:57:21.699]  So this next year, from October through September, we're probably okay.
[02:57:21.699 --> 02:57:24.661]  After that, there's no, it's very bleak.
[02:57:25.743 --> 02:57:29.887]  So, what have you got a couple thousand members paying their hundred and something bucks a year without help?
[02:57:29.887 --> 02:57:31.248]  That would help tremendously.
[02:57:31.248 --> 02:57:34.771]  It's to show that we are relevant and valuable to our community.
[02:57:34.771 --> 02:57:35.532]  It would help tremendously.
[02:57:35.532 --> 02:57:39.476]  Well, it's just such a zombie culture where everybody's running around trying to be trendy.
[02:57:39.476 --> 02:57:42.058]  People will come here for South by Southwest to be ripped off.
[02:57:42.058 --> 02:57:43.099]  The whole thing's a giant scam.
[02:57:43.399 --> 02:57:45.360]  Not against it, it's just the whole thing is a big joke.
[02:57:45.360 --> 02:57:46.620]  It's like selling dreams.
[02:57:46.620 --> 02:57:49.701]  They get here, bands pay to play to 200 people.
[02:57:49.701 --> 02:57:51.942]  The record companies already have their people here playing.
[02:57:51.942 --> 02:57:54.243]  It's not what it was 15 years ago.
[02:57:54.243 --> 02:57:57.224]  You pay all this money, and then nothing happens.
[02:57:57.224 --> 02:58:02.205]  Meanwhile, there's a place with thousands of viewers every hour just waiting for you.
[02:58:02.205 --> 02:58:04.526]  Just waiting for you to go put your music videos on.
[02:58:04.526 --> 02:58:10.548]  I mean, again, it's this zombie culture where people just don't know where the real opportunities are.
[02:58:11.738 --> 02:58:12.839]  You're right.
[02:58:12.839 --> 02:58:13.960]  Thank you.
[02:58:13.960 --> 02:58:16.161]  All right, Linda, we're going to end this transmission right here.
[02:58:16.161 --> 02:58:17.862]  Go to that interview with you.
[02:58:17.862 --> 02:58:24.587]  Folks, we've got to pray for our veterans, because even though these wars are evil, they're being used up and having drugs tested on.
[02:58:24.587 --> 02:58:25.768]  Their suicides are off the chart.
[02:58:25.768 --> 02:58:26.888]  I covered that earlier.
[02:58:26.888 --> 02:58:29.070]  Going to do a report on the nightly news, more on that.
[02:58:29.070 --> 02:58:33.613]  You're going to see hosting part of the nightly news tonight, Jakari Jackson, one of our new reporters.
[02:58:33.613 --> 02:58:36.915]  And tomorrow night, I'm going to interview Dan Badondi.
[02:58:36.915 --> 02:58:38.056]  We couldn't do it without you.
[02:58:38.056 --> 02:58:38.877]  I love you all.
