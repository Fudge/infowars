[00:00:20.646 --> 00:00:25.170]  Well, you know what they say, broken clocks are right twice a day and blind hogs do occasionally find acorns and truffles.
[00:00:40.863 --> 00:00:51.867]  And there's Shepard Smith of Fox News pointing out that early trends from the latest polls show that Ron Paul should handily win the Iowa caucuses.
[00:00:51.927 --> 00:01:03.791]  Now they've just started the voting at the precincts and it has to be tabulated at that secret location because anonymous hackers have threatened to disrupt it.
[00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:20.315]  And I saw it reported today that the fellow who's been out protesting in front of Ron Paul's offices in Iowa with Anonymous is reportedly the person that uploaded the video of Anonymous saying that hackers were going to go after it.
[00:01:20.395 --> 00:01:23.336]  So you can see who the system is definitely upset about.
[00:01:23.656 --> 00:01:25.457]  The Drudge Report is linked to our article.
[00:01:25.517 --> 00:01:29.898]  Tonight's Iowa vote count to take place at secret location.
[00:01:30.498 --> 00:01:39.624]  Continuing, concerns about supervision grow after Republican strategist says GOP establishment will not allow Ron Paul to win.
[00:01:39.845 --> 00:01:45.589]  We're going to break some more of this down and then we're going to have constitutional lawyer Timothy Baldwin joining us to talk about
[00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:51.371]  Election 2012, the attack on states' rights, and more that is coming up.
[00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:52.432]  So there's that report.
[00:01:53.052 --> 00:02:00.476]  Concerns about subversion grow after Republican strategist says GOP establishment will not allow Ron Paul to win.
[00:02:01.276 --> 00:02:08.600]  And we have the full clip of the strategist who's a frequent guest on Fox News telling Iowa Radio this.
[00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:19.705]  And it's not clear if she's saying they're not going to let him win by influencing people or something else, but they sound very confident that Ron Paul is not going to be allowed to win.
[00:02:19.725 --> 00:02:23.066]  In fact, here's the article and we've got part of the transcript here.
[00:02:23.406 --> 00:02:26.708]  Republican insider, GOP establishment planning to subvert
[00:02:28.028 --> 00:02:29.750]  Iowa to prevent Ron Paul win.
[00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:48.708]  Now, I had Ron Paul's brother, who's another great patriot, Anti-Federal Reserve activist, on today, and he sent it to top folks in the campaign and they said, no, we're aware of these reports, people are saying this, and we're reporting on what they're saying, but we've got people everywhere and it looks like that this process is going to be fair.
[00:02:49.128 --> 00:02:50.390]  So let's hope that that's the case.
[00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.491]  We'll know more tomorrow.
[00:02:52.051 --> 00:03:01.314]  In the aftermath of this, because they're not doing the voting, but it's got to be sent to that secret location, and I guess finagled for a while until we find out exactly what happened.
[00:03:01.674 --> 00:03:19.179]  McBrain has an interesting theory, one of our reporters, and that's that they know he's probably got a 20 point lead as some reel on the street polls are showing, and so they just want people to know that he's such a frontrunner, but they know they can't steal it because it's too obvious, so they might have him win by one point or something.
[00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:21.580]  We're going to find out, maybe even by the end of the show tonight.
[00:03:23.007 --> 00:03:33.531]  Continuing, the host of the show refers to the state GOP insiders showing great concern that Ron Paul is performing well in Iowa because they fear Ron Paul win would undermine Iowa's position as being the first Republican primary.
[00:03:33.931 --> 00:03:38.393]  Oh, it undermines it if people vote for him, implying Ron Paul is undermining the state.
[00:03:38.933 --> 00:03:49.037]  He implies that influential members of the Republican establishment within the state are offering sweetheart deals to prominent voting blocs and key swing districts in order to sway the result and ensure Ron Paul doesn't win.
[00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:54.259]  And it goes on with the D.D.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:09.809]  Benkey saying, is it possible that the party apparatus here could be silently acting and asking those district chairmen to start swaying some important caucus members over the anti-Paul end, which may end up being Santorum.
[00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.772]  Do you see a scenario like that happening, he asked her.
[00:04:14.172 --> 00:04:16.274]  And then she said, I've talked to party officials
[00:04:17.777 --> 00:04:30.082]  I know they're concerned about it, said Binkey, adding that Ron Paul doesn't do us any good in Iowa, doesn't do our country any good, and never get there, so let's figure out what we can do.
[00:04:31.343 --> 00:04:35.225]  And then it goes on to talk about the party officials swaying people not to vote for him.
[00:04:36.225 --> 00:04:40.007]  So this could be seen either way, but we're going to continue to track that.
[00:04:42.778 --> 00:04:43.319]  This evening.
[00:04:44.239 --> 00:04:47.440]  Continuing, there's another article by Kurt Nemo breaking this down.
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.702]  Transparent Vote countering the establishment monopoly on vote reporting.
[00:04:53.562 --> 00:05:09.087]  And there's different organizations like Transparent Vote that are asking people at all of the locations to demand to see the local precinct tally and to have it posted as it's legally supposed to be and not called in to the quote secret location.
[00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:17.672]  So the quote national election pool, I guess that's tied into voter news services, can basically tell us whatever they want.
[00:05:19.292 --> 00:05:28.135]  Continuing here with the Ron Paul news, Santorum lashes out at Ron Paul, calls Iowa frontrunner disgusting.
[00:05:28.715 --> 00:05:36.157]  And Santorum's also broken down crying, talking about children, lots of other desperate little staged events from the neocon.
[00:05:37.237 --> 00:05:43.464]  There's really no end to the things that they'll do calling somebody who's simply a constitutionalist disgusting.
[00:05:43.884 --> 00:05:51.031]  But I guess as George Orwell said, telling the truth in a world of universal deceit is a revolutionary act.
[00:05:51.852 --> 00:05:57.317]  Shifting gears, there's an article here out of the Telegraph today, children becoming addicted to computers.
[00:05:58.268 --> 00:05:58.868]  Well, that's true.
[00:05:59.369 --> 00:06:02.031]  And children in all the big studies are also addicted to television.
[00:06:02.431 --> 00:06:09.257]  But they're really going after computers because at least there it's interactive and isn't just 10 or 15 flavors of globalist propaganda.
[00:06:09.677 --> 00:06:16.643]  They might actually run into some truth online and so that's why the system is so concerned about the Internet because it's supplanting them.
[00:06:18.144 --> 00:06:21.887]  In fact, I've never seen my children get the same zombie-like stare being on the computer.
[00:06:23.288 --> 00:06:29.832]  doing interactive learning or researching something they're doing than when they actually are allowed to watch television and you can't get their attention.
[00:06:30.732 --> 00:06:32.213]  So there is that report.
[00:06:32.853 --> 00:06:35.194]  And here's another report out of CBS News.
[00:06:36.095 --> 00:06:39.397]  Charlton Library sends police to collect overdue books from a five-year-old.
[00:06:40.497 --> 00:06:49.522]  I've seen cases in Williamson County, just north of Austin, where if a video is a day overdue, they come and arrest you and charge you with theft
[00:06:50.453 --> 00:06:53.315]  In one case from the Hollywood video that was up there a few years ago.
[00:06:53.335 --> 00:06:55.556]  Of course, that was back when they still had video stores.
[00:06:55.577 --> 00:06:56.877]  Now everything's gone to Redbox.
[00:06:57.558 --> 00:07:18.472]  But it just shows this throw the book at petty criminals or people that aren't even criminals, but then let MF Global steal a billion plus dollars because it's politically connected, give 16 plus trillion to the private Federal Reserve to give to private individuals, and then have no discussion about where the money went, even when Ben Bernanke gets caught lying about it.
[00:07:20.548 --> 00:07:31.241]  Now, continuing with the CBS piece, here's a short clip where the police officer says, yeah, it does seem like an overreaction, but I'm just following orders.
[00:07:31.601 --> 00:07:32.803]  Where did we hear that before?
[00:07:33.598 --> 00:07:40.822]  Nobody wanted to, on this end, get involved in it, but the library contacted us, and the chief delegated, and apparently I was one of the low men on the totem pole.
[00:07:41.162 --> 00:07:50.206]  But state law does outline a misdemeanor for such things, and police thought a friendly reminder might make a better impression, and get better results, than a cold summons to court.
[00:07:50.446 --> 00:07:55.789]  The library director knew she'd get flack over this, but... If something seems overblown, it is.
[00:07:56.069 --> 00:07:57.470]  Use some discretion, police.
[00:07:58.519 --> 00:08:04.882]  If you don't have better things to do and real criminals to go after, perhaps your police department could be downsized.
[00:08:05.383 --> 00:08:06.804]  After all, we're in a depression here.
[00:08:07.244 --> 00:08:09.985]  But see, police can only revenue generate now in many cases.
[00:08:10.285 --> 00:08:11.606]  They can't actually help the people.
[00:08:12.166 --> 00:08:14.648]  That's because we're going into this austerity predatory system.
[00:08:15.965 --> 00:08:17.986]  I have another report here.
[00:08:18.307 --> 00:08:20.008]  This is out of the London Telegraph as well.
[00:08:20.768 --> 00:08:24.691]  At one of the Queen's estates, police examined human remains.
[00:08:25.211 --> 00:08:33.157]  Residents have expressed shock at the discovery of human remains in the woodland on the estate, the Queen's Country Retreat in Norfolk.
[00:08:33.757 --> 00:08:35.819]  You know, they're constantly digging up dead bodies.
[00:08:35.839 --> 00:08:38.561]  They're finding dead bodies on Bush Estates around the United States.
[00:08:39.701 --> 00:08:42.584]  They're always finding dead bodies at Royal Estates.
[00:08:43.244 --> 00:08:44.225]  They have a lot of employees.
[00:08:44.265 --> 00:08:45.105]  It could be some of them.
[00:08:45.686 --> 00:08:46.546]  But we also have...
[00:08:47.645 --> 00:08:55.267]  Previous reports in the Daily Mail and others about the Royal Family dining on human flesh just a couple hundred years ago.
[00:08:56.087 --> 00:08:59.068]  So there's no idea what these predators have really been up to.
[00:08:59.948 --> 00:09:06.450]  Detectives are set to return to the scene Tuesday as they continue to try to establish the identity of the remains.
[00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:08.411]  A post-mortem is due to take place.
[00:09:08.431 --> 00:09:16.613]  It remains unclear how long the remains have been there, if there is in fact a body or the age of the victim or victims.
[00:09:18.223 --> 00:09:21.224]  The Dog Walker has also not been named.
[00:09:22.324 --> 00:09:25.365]  And they say that the operation has been shrouded in secrecy.
[00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:27.266]  And see, that's the problem.
[00:09:27.746 --> 00:09:31.467]  Because it's the royals that's shrouded in secrecy.
[00:09:31.487 --> 00:09:34.128]  Now there it is, British royalty dined on human flesh.
[00:09:34.148 --> 00:09:36.229]  But don't worry, it was 300 years ago.
[00:09:36.249 --> 00:09:36.789]  Yeah, right.
[00:09:37.409 --> 00:09:41.514]  They say they quit wiping their hind ends 90 years ago or so, but we did research.
[00:09:41.875 --> 00:09:43.437]  They still have grooms of the stool.
[00:09:43.957 --> 00:09:51.006]  Oh yes, their defecation is examined, and generally a top lord is there to wipe their bottoms, because they're so holy.
[00:09:51.667 --> 00:09:53.229]  They dare not have to do it themselves.
[00:09:53.249 --> 00:09:55.832]  I mean, look at that!
[00:09:59.136 --> 00:10:05.101]  It is just a stone's throw away from Stud and the Royal House.
[00:10:05.161 --> 00:10:05.901]  It's very close.
[00:10:07.062 --> 00:10:08.323]  You couldn't get very close to the site.
[00:10:08.343 --> 00:10:10.805]  Police said they expected to be there through tomorrow.
[00:10:11.265 --> 00:10:12.226]  So there you have it.
[00:10:12.266 --> 00:10:20.912]  There's a nice telling photograph of Witchiepoo, Queen Elizabeth II, there on the front of the article.
[00:10:21.772 --> 00:10:24.454]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, that is it for
[00:10:25.595 --> 00:10:34.259]  The news section, and we'll have more for you obviously tomorrow when we know more about what happened in Iowa, but it's very exciting to see how much support Ron Paul's getting.
[00:10:34.279 --> 00:10:37.701]  It shows that liberty is rising and the tyrants are squirming.
[00:10:38.121 --> 00:10:45.304]  We're going to come back with Mr. Baldwin to break down more on the campaign trail and look at the attack on the Tenth Amendment states' rights.
[00:10:45.704 --> 00:10:47.325]  Stay with us, it's InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:10:51.215 --> 00:10:52.376]  America is in trouble.
[00:10:52.536 --> 00:10:54.438]  Washington is a disgrace.
[00:10:54.658 --> 00:10:56.019]  Government has become too big.
[00:10:56.099 --> 00:10:57.880]  It's overtaxing, overspending.
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.421]  We need to change direction.
[00:10:59.461 --> 00:11:00.582]  We really need change.
[00:11:00.602 --> 00:11:03.484]  We can't afford to make the same mistakes we've made in the past.
[00:11:03.504 --> 00:11:05.686]  Mitt Romney's reputation is a flip-flopper.
[00:11:05.726 --> 00:11:08.929]  He went the other way when he got paid to go the other way.
[00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:10.990]  There is need for economic stimulus.
[00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:12.631]  It's about serial hypocrisy.
[00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:14.433]  This election is about trust.
[00:11:14.653 --> 00:11:17.996]  There's been one true, consistent candidate, and that's Dr. Ron Paul.
[00:11:18.056 --> 00:11:21.038]  Ron Paul has been so consistent from the very beginning.
[00:11:21.278 --> 00:11:23.118]  He seems like a more honest candidate.
[00:11:23.138 --> 00:11:25.779]  He tells the truth about what he believes, whether you like it or not.
[00:11:25.819 --> 00:11:30.600]  He's never once voted for a tax increase, never once voted for an unbalanced budget.
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:33.481]  Ron Paul's plan is bold, cuts five departments.
[00:11:33.781 --> 00:11:34.481]  It's what we need.
[00:11:34.661 --> 00:11:38.322]  When he says he's gonna cut a trillion dollars in the first year, I believe it.
[00:11:38.402 --> 00:11:43.483]  If you don't like how things are going, and you're tired of politicians, he's something different.
[00:11:43.743 --> 00:11:44.323]  Ron Paul.
[00:11:44.423 --> 00:11:45.023]  Ron Paul.
[00:11:45.063 --> 00:11:45.743]  Ron Paul.
[00:11:45.863 --> 00:11:46.564]  Ron Paul.
[00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:48.184]  Is the one we've been looking for.
[00:11:48.784 --> 00:11:50.745]  I'm Ron Paul, and I approve this message.

[00:12:17.753 --> 00:12:18.394]  It's all there.

[00:12:28.657 --> 00:12:35.358]  It was between 1972 and 73, but it was still a lot of prejudice around this area.
[00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:46.211]  My wife was sick and I was trying to get some attention for her.
[00:12:47.072 --> 00:12:48.352]  Nobody came to check.
[00:12:48.772 --> 00:12:49.912]  They just left her there.
[00:12:51.013 --> 00:12:57.415]  Well, I believe I was left there because of the difference, uh, me being black and her being white.
[00:12:57.615 --> 00:13:03.717]  And every time I would say something to her, he'd notice that she would get pretty upset.
[00:13:04.557 --> 00:13:09.058]  And then she finally called the, uh, Freeport Police Department.
[00:13:09.919 --> 00:13:11.239]  Said I was harassing her.
[00:13:12.563 --> 00:13:14.564]  And I mean, I didn't know anything to do.
[00:13:15.064 --> 00:13:17.566]  Well, then Ron Paul come to my rescue.
[00:13:18.606 --> 00:13:22.068]  He just stepped in and went to work with my wife.
[00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:32.334]  And after he seen her, I say no more than 10 minutes later, she had a stillborn boy child.
[00:13:33.575 --> 00:13:37.657]  And he said, as far as the bill, he would take care of everything, which he did.
[00:13:37.677 --> 00:13:41.059]  I never got a bill from the hospital or anything.
[00:13:41.957 --> 00:13:55.063]  He was a doctor of medicine and that's what he was doing was practicing medicine and it didn't matter who and what and why he was doing it because he think of one human being just as much as another.
[00:13:56.163 --> 00:14:03.486]  He's just a honest man and that's something we need now in this day and time.
[00:14:03.987 --> 00:14:06.708]  It's a lot of politics and no honesty.
[00:14:07.688 --> 00:14:09.089]  When you have honesty, well,
[00:14:10.157 --> 00:14:13.718]  People will try to do anything to blot you out.
[00:14:15.018 --> 00:14:20.880]  And that's what they will try to do to him, is blot him out, because he will be honest.
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.540]  And they need more like him.

[00:14:41.613 --> 00:14:47.779]  We're back, it's InfoWars Nightly News, and it's the big caucus night, obviously.
[00:14:47.799 --> 00:14:53.565]  They're in Iowa, and we're going to have all the full results and analysis for you tomorrow.
[00:14:53.945 --> 00:15:01.213]  We're going to have the expert on electronic voting machine fraud, Bev Harris, joining us on the radio tomorrow.
[00:15:01.693 --> 00:15:05.074]  And then later in the week back here on InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:15:05.574 --> 00:15:10.655]  But I wanted to invite a guest from the radio show here on the Nightly News, Timothy Baldwin.
[00:15:10.695 --> 00:15:12.456]  Tim Baldwin is a constitutional lawyer.
[00:15:12.476 --> 00:15:14.956]  He heads up Liberty Defense League.
[00:15:14.976 --> 00:15:16.056]  He does a lot of great work.
[00:15:16.076 --> 00:15:17.017]  He's also an author.
[00:15:17.577 --> 00:15:20.937]  And his father is a prominent fighter for liberty.
[00:15:20.957 --> 00:15:26.619]  Of course, that's Chuck Baldwin, the presidential candidate from 2008 for the Constitution Party.
[00:15:26.679 --> 00:15:27.279]  And he joins us
[00:15:27.779 --> 00:15:32.601]  From Montana to give us his take on what's happening this political season.
[00:15:33.241 --> 00:15:38.123]  And obviously the stakes are higher than they've ever been before to defeat this globalist takeover.
[00:15:38.403 --> 00:15:44.105]  And there's an awakening bigger than anything I've ever seen happening.
[00:15:44.125 --> 00:15:46.746]  But I want to get his view from Montana on that as well.
[00:15:47.167 --> 00:15:49.287]  Ron Paul and a lot more.
[00:15:49.607 --> 00:15:50.648]  Tim, great to have you with us.
[00:15:51.308 --> 00:15:51.828]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:15:52.048 --> 00:15:53.149]  It's a pleasure to be with you today.
[00:15:54.158 --> 00:15:55.358]  Well, you heard my intro.
[00:15:56.118 --> 00:15:57.939]  What type of awakening are you seeing?
[00:15:57.979 --> 00:16:01.000]  Are you seeing the same explosive awakening that I'm witnessing?
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:05.041]  Well, I think it's many parts, actually, Alex.
[00:16:05.081 --> 00:16:08.821]  I think there's an explosive awakening to some people.
[00:16:09.242 --> 00:16:11.642]  And to others, I think it's a progressive awakening.
[00:16:12.402 --> 00:16:13.282]  Either one of them is good.
[00:16:13.303 --> 00:16:19.324]  They both should lead to the same result, and that is there's... in our country from the top down.
[00:16:21.325 --> 00:16:21.805]  You're right.
[00:16:22.286 --> 00:16:28.511]  I mean, everybody I talk to, whether it's Ron Paul or your dad, I mean, anybody, they're seeing people finally get it.
[00:16:28.931 --> 00:16:31.213]  Why do you think the awakening is accelerating?
[00:16:32.742 --> 00:16:53.675]  I think it sort of goes to this self-preservation, self-defense kind of a mechanism in our nature, and that is when we start to see things around us that are causing our stability to be challenged, our predictability of the future to be questioned, those types of factors are in play here because of the economy, because of the
[00:16:55.437 --> 00:16:56.738]  We've seen them for so many years.
[00:16:58.079 --> 00:17:07.546]  People are starting to question the system as a whole and so they're looking around them, they're looking at leaders like Ron Paul and they're listening to what they're saying and saying, you know, that makes sense.
[00:17:08.006 --> 00:17:16.372]  So they start to research, they start to study, they start to listen to their friends or family who are saying these things and their minds are convinced.
[00:17:16.773 --> 00:17:19.575]  So I think it's just a natural progress.
[00:17:22.441 --> 00:17:24.603]  Record gun sales in the month of December.
[00:17:25.084 --> 00:17:29.649]  Over 1.5 million background checks, and that's only people buying from registered gun dealers.
[00:17:30.069 --> 00:17:34.834]  The estimate, the average person was buying a little more than two firearms, so that's over three million guns.
[00:17:35.275 --> 00:17:38.698]  An all-time record of the accelerated sales are just continuing.
[00:17:39.259 --> 00:17:43.583]  And I saw some surveys of people, why they were buying guns, and the number one reason was
[00:17:44.525 --> 00:17:50.856]  collapse of the government, collapse of society, and not trusting the government's civil unrest.
[00:17:50.876 --> 00:17:56.287]  I mean, that's a strong vote right there of no confidence for this puppet government.
[00:17:57.726 --> 00:18:14.094]  I think it's been going that way for many years, and some people would claim that that is silly talk, it's paranoia, but when you have such a large consensus about what's going on from people who really have no personal agenda,
[00:18:14.514 --> 00:18:24.705]  People who are business people or professionals or whatever status they might be, they're looking at this from a very objective point of view and they don't see stability.
[00:18:24.745 --> 00:18:33.414]  They see that there's potentially some very troubling times ahead of us and of course that self-defense mechanism that we talked about earlier.
[00:18:34.514 --> 00:18:44.701]  We have to protect ourselves as individuals, protecting our families, and so it's no wonder people are loading their shelves with food and stocking ammunition and those types of things.
[00:18:44.921 --> 00:18:45.482]  They're scared.
[00:18:47.165 --> 00:18:52.108]  Well, when you look at the type of globalists we have running our society, that is a reason to be concerned.
[00:18:52.168 --> 00:19:02.273]  I mean, these are anti-family, anti-sovereignty, anti-free market, crony capitalists who want to overthrow our system and bring in the post-industrial world.
[00:19:03.513 --> 00:19:10.317]  As a constitutional lawyer, but also talking to your dad, what is your view on why they passed the NDAA?
[00:19:10.817 --> 00:19:15.740]  Why the system, the tyrants, are really more and more coming out of the closet?
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:21.387]  Admitting that they want to have internet censorship, a selective kill switch.
[00:19:22.028 --> 00:19:25.072]  I mean, they are really doing our job for us now.
[00:19:26.073 --> 00:19:29.738]  I mean, the stuff we talked about a decade ago and get laughed at for, it's now all happening.
[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.723]  And the system isn't even trying to hide it a lot now.
[00:19:33.712 --> 00:19:36.115]  Well, it's the Bullying Frog analogy.
[00:19:36.135 --> 00:19:43.464]  You know, typically, you know, people who have a source, they're not going to lay their agenda out all at one time.
[00:19:43.524 --> 00:19:46.487]  They're just, that would be foolish of them to do that.
[00:19:46.507 --> 00:19:47.769]  It would raise too many flags.
[00:19:48.169 --> 00:19:50.011]  The people would become alarmed.
[00:19:50.572 --> 00:19:51.813]  And so they do it incrementally.
[00:19:51.874 --> 00:19:53.335]  That's what they've been doing for many years.
[00:19:53.916 --> 00:19:55.818]  And so it's just one brick on top of the other.
[00:19:56.198 --> 00:19:58.220]  The NDAA is just another brick.
[00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:01.364]  If not, it's the cement that holds the brick together.
[00:20:02.125 --> 00:20:09.252]  And it is a bill that a lot of people, or it's actually a law now since Obama signed it, that people are very concerned about.
[00:20:10.093 --> 00:20:17.019]  It does, in fact, admit or acknowledge or recognize the President as having power to arrest U.S.
[00:20:17.059 --> 00:20:26.747]  citizens without judicial warrant, without probable cause, without any judicial review whatsoever, and they can be held under the laws of war.
[00:20:27.148 --> 00:20:33.153]  That is a very dangerous place to be in if you're supposed to be living under a constitutional system of government.
[00:20:34.684 --> 00:20:42.931]  Well, you're right, and then it's got all the other provisions about declaring the world a battlefield, and then transferring that power to the President.
[00:20:42.971 --> 00:20:45.674]  That's really a transfer of a lot of the war powers.
[00:20:46.895 --> 00:20:54.082]  Expanding on that, you know, talking to people there in your area of the world, and to folks that visit your different websites,
[00:20:54.742 --> 00:20:56.804]  What is the sense of the population?
[00:20:58.206 --> 00:21:06.574]  I mean, from my perspective, they think the establishment is just going to go forward, the tyranny is only going to get worse, and that a big confrontation is coming.
[00:21:07.555 --> 00:21:08.096]  What's your view?
[00:21:09.758 --> 00:21:12.500]  You know, it's hard to say if that's going to happen or not.
[00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:22.087]  I know there are a lot of us, including yourself and people who are trying to educate people who hope for political resolution.
[00:21:22.428 --> 00:21:31.635]  We hope for resolution through the political and democratic process within a constitutional republic form of government, and we're doing everything we can
[00:21:32.475 --> 00:21:42.397]  To lay out the issues, to lay out the calls, the call to action, trying to get people to understand where we are, why things are happening the way they are.
[00:21:43.217 --> 00:21:47.718]  So, and that's one of the reasons why so many other people are waking up to what's going on around us.
[00:21:48.438 --> 00:22:01.241]  I think that with the number of people that are awake in 2012, the powers that be would be very foolish to try to force certain things down our throats without consent
[00:22:02.119 --> 00:22:11.104]  Because the repercussions would just be too devastating for their agenda and because they're accomplishing so much as it is without that sort of force.
[00:22:11.845 --> 00:22:13.306]  So I think they're going to continue to do that.
[00:22:13.346 --> 00:22:18.749]  But as long as the people become awake and aware of what's going on, they're going to have a difficult time of doing this through political means.
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:20.761]  Well, you're right.
[00:22:20.821 --> 00:22:27.628]  I mean, that's one reason Obama said he would veto the bill, then signed it, then said, well, it does affect citizens, but don't worry, I won't implement it.
[00:22:28.128 --> 00:22:37.718]  They don't want to do things completely in the open because it helps us then form a larger and larger political movement that's really awake to what's happening.
[00:22:38.679 --> 00:22:40.320]  Watching Congressman Ron Paul
[00:22:41.221 --> 00:22:45.185]  And the different dirty tricks they're running, they're not working as well as they did in the past.
[00:22:45.225 --> 00:22:48.368]  So now I'm expecting to see more election fraud.
[00:22:48.709 --> 00:22:54.375]  I know the campaign doesn't like to talk about that because they've made the calculation that then it makes people think, well, why vote?
[00:22:54.395 --> 00:22:55.496]  They'll just cheat it anyways.
[00:22:56.457 --> 00:22:58.919]  But we are seeing some evidence of that going on.
[00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:02.223]  Overall, what do you think about this Ron Paul phenomenon?
[00:23:02.875 --> 00:23:04.596]  Well, he is a movement.
[00:23:04.616 --> 00:23:12.800]  You know, Ron Paul is iconic in so many ways because he cuts across the board of party labels, across the board of schools of thought.
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:30.228]  He attracts so many different Americans because he stands for this idea of individual liberty, reducing the power of government from the elitist mentality, putting it back into the states, putting it back to the individual where it belongs, and people are very much attracted to that.
[00:23:30.808 --> 00:23:33.169]  His movement is one that will not die, Alex.
[00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:46.376]  Even if he doesn't get elected or nominated or elected as president, his movement that he started through much of what he's done in Congress will continue with people like you and me and the people that we are able to influence.
[00:23:47.196 --> 00:23:56.801]  So, you know, it's just like a Star Wars episode where Obi-Wan Kenobi, if he perishes, then Luke Skywalker will take the baton and go forward, and that's what's happening right now.
[00:23:58.001 --> 00:24:04.368]  Well, we've got sources inside Bilderberg, and going back even to 2006, they're very upset about Ron Paul.
[00:24:05.069 --> 00:24:14.699]  And back then it wasn't because they thought he could even win, it was the fact that the youth aren't getting into fake neocon, warmongering, police state, fake conservatism.
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:19.843]  And they're not getting into the liberal communism.
[00:24:20.463 --> 00:24:23.685]  They're actually getting into Americana constitutionalism.
[00:24:24.446 --> 00:24:33.732]  And then, by the last time we got intel on this was 2010, they are freaking out about Ron Paul as a focal point.
[00:24:33.772 --> 00:24:40.556]  And as you said, as Ron Paul has said, he is just that, a focal point, and he's using this as a way to educate people.
[00:24:40.596 --> 00:24:41.297]  He could win.
[00:24:42.057 --> 00:24:45.962]  But even if he doesn't win, we win by being involved.
[00:24:46.022 --> 00:24:50.728]  I mean, Ron Paul, 15 years ago in Congress, couldn't get one co-sponsored audit of the Fed.
[00:24:51.128 --> 00:24:53.511]  Last year, 2011, it passed the House.
[00:24:54.032 --> 00:24:56.555]  They procedurally killed it in the Senate and watered it down.
[00:24:56.936 --> 00:24:57.456]  But still!
[00:24:58.257 --> 00:25:03.322]  We've got to look at this in the balance of decades, not in days or weeks or months.
[00:25:03.963 --> 00:25:09.469]  We are having huge positive effects right now, exponentially.
[00:25:09.569 --> 00:25:18.017]  My concern is, how will the globalists that have taken control through fractional reserve banking, through giant global Ponzi schemes, how are they going to strike back?
[00:25:18.798 --> 00:25:20.220]  Tim Baldwin, what's your view on that?
[00:25:21.288 --> 00:25:22.989]  Well, they're going to try every method they can.
[00:25:23.009 --> 00:25:30.756]  You know, retaining power sometimes can be a very difficult thing when the structure itself is starting to shake and starting to tremble.
[00:25:31.396 --> 00:25:44.606]  You know, if you look around us, especially with the state sovereignty movement, you have people who are focusing now on using the states to restore freedom, and I've been a big part of that as well, and it is in fact a key focal point.
[00:25:45.507 --> 00:26:03.910]  Of the issues at hand, if the global bankers cannot control the banking system, the economic and financial system, then it's back into the hands of the people through their state governments and the influence that they have over the entire country and the entire world
[00:26:05.249 --> 00:26:06.130]  Seriously undermined.
[00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:14.635]  And so you have people like Chuck Baldwin, who's running as Lieutenant Governor of Montana, along with Bob Fanning, who is the Governor candidate for Montana.
[00:26:15.096 --> 00:26:31.867]  They are strongly advocating that Montana have a state bank that will... that the central banking system has created over the years, giving the people of Montana a financial future in prosperity and independence.
[00:26:32.796 --> 00:26:45.566]  That's right, taking the money power away from offshore mega banks who then hand themselves government authority and actually having it under the state government as the Constitution states or the federal government, expanding on that.
[00:26:46.186 --> 00:26:48.748]  Now the system is really scared of the states' rights movement.
[00:26:48.768 --> 00:26:58.036]  That's why the globalist stage of the Oklahoma City bombing was because of a huge states' rights movement centered around Oklahoma City that was growing across the country.
[00:26:58.796 --> 00:27:12.708]  At the time, get us out of the UN, get back to American values, true constitutional conservatism, and so that was staged as the film A Noble Lie exposes to be blamed on the liberty movement in this country.
[00:27:13.048 --> 00:27:22.076]  But here we are 15, 16, 17 years later, that same old demonization isn't working anymore, and there's this attempt to say there are no states' rights.
[00:27:22.136 --> 00:27:24.558]  Well, why until the 17th Amendment in 1913,
[00:27:26.039 --> 00:27:32.206]  Did the state legislatures who were elected, why did they vote to select the U.S.
[00:27:32.246 --> 00:27:34.368]  Senator that's now popularly elected?
[00:27:34.629 --> 00:27:36.671]  Why do we even have states or jurisdictions?
[00:27:37.472 --> 00:27:45.600]  The truth is the 9th and 10th Amendment state very, very clearly that it is key to have the states
[00:27:46.241 --> 00:27:57.630]  And that they should really, at the end of the day, have more power than the federal government, and have a right to even pull out of the federal government if the federal government becomes destructive of their rights and liberties and freedoms, and the same for the people.
[00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:59.531]  The Ninth Amendment states that, as you know.
[00:28:00.052 --> 00:28:06.237]  But we have this idea now of just saying, hey, and you wrote an article about this this week that we linked to at m4wars.com,
[00:28:08.534 --> 00:28:13.395]  We're hearing more and more even Republicans come out and say, no, that was decided in the Civil War.
[00:28:13.735 --> 00:28:15.096]  The federal government's all-powerful.
[00:28:15.456 --> 00:28:16.516]  Well, okay, really?
[00:28:16.536 --> 00:28:19.177]  Then I guess, you know, Obama is a dictator then.
[00:28:19.297 --> 00:28:21.277]  I guess, why do we even have states?
[00:28:22.238 --> 00:28:23.238]  Break that down for us.
[00:28:24.138 --> 00:28:31.400]  Yeah, there's a mentality that has been very prevalent throughout the United States where it doesn't matter which political party you're in, Republican, Democrat, or whatever.
[00:28:33.346 --> 00:28:49.220]  In the legal community, I can tell you, since I am in the legal community, in the Bar Association here in Montana, that there is this prevailing idea that, and you're taught this in law school, that federal laws trump state laws, and there's no qualification to that statement.
[00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:50.280]  If the federal law
[00:28:51.218 --> 00:28:55.080]  Ask the state law, whatever it might be, is trumped by that federal law.
[00:28:56.081 --> 00:29:03.085]  There is no study and no intentful purpose to really give effects to the 9th and the 10th Amendment.
[00:29:03.525 --> 00:29:07.527]  And you see that throughout the attorneys and judges in the country.
[00:29:08.287 --> 00:29:10.209]  The article that I wrote was in reference to a
[00:29:11.189 --> 00:29:24.744]  And the AG candidate in Montana who's a Republican who made some statements while he was sitting as a state senator about the Civil War and its effect on the state's rights to interpose against federal usurpation.
[00:29:25.304 --> 00:29:27.647]  And he actually is in the process of writing
[00:29:29.778 --> 00:29:32.481]  Which I have not seen yet, so we'll see what his detailed response is.
[00:29:32.821 --> 00:29:38.645]  But regardless of his particular view, that is a prevailing view of the Constitution of the United States.
[00:29:39.106 --> 00:29:39.966]  It's an incorrect view.
[00:29:39.986 --> 00:29:49.573]  If you read the Federalist Papers, as I mentioned in that article, and detailed in that article, they were very explicit about the state's right and duty to interpose against federal usurpation.
[00:29:49.974 --> 00:29:54.117]  And if you look at that bill that Obama signed on New Year's Eve,
[00:29:55.851 --> 00:30:01.687]  You know, this is reason why the state should be paying attention for such reasons as the indefinite detention of U.S.
[00:30:01.727 --> 00:30:02.088]  citizens.
[00:30:03.683 --> 00:30:06.305]  Well, I mean, look at New Hampshire's right to revolt.
[00:30:06.886 --> 00:30:09.408]  It's right there that any time the state wants to pull out, it can.
[00:30:09.468 --> 00:30:16.655]  Texas is the Lone Star State because it opted in by treaty and can pull out any time it wants.
[00:30:17.496 --> 00:30:19.337]  It's the only state that entered that way.
[00:30:20.238 --> 00:30:29.086]  I know out West, the Feds were more powerful then, so some of the ways that those territories were brought in have a little bit less states' rights.
[00:30:29.867 --> 00:30:52.484]  But once you have states that have rights, those trump those in precedent, and travel over to the western states, which in some areas, as you know, are over 85% federal land, and they act like, you know, federal gods harassing the people out there that are few and far between, but this outrageous idea that Obama can launch a war in Libya and not even consult Congress now.
[00:30:52.964 --> 00:30:57.768]  We're seeing an overall war against the Bill of Rights and Constitution
[00:30:58.388 --> 00:30:58.468]  Yes.
[00:31:12.572 --> 00:31:14.093]  That was like the oxygen in the room.
[00:31:14.593 --> 00:31:16.293]  All of our prosperity went with it.
[00:31:16.833 --> 00:31:18.574]  It's not the Constitution that went wrong.
[00:31:18.954 --> 00:31:21.375]  We went wrong by letting tyrants come in and get rid of it.
[00:31:21.735 --> 00:31:24.135]  I mean, it's so simple what the Ninth and Tenth Amendments say.
[00:31:24.175 --> 00:31:24.896]  It's so simple.
[00:31:25.316 --> 00:31:29.337]  If you read the Federalist Papers and how the states made up the federal government.
[00:31:30.137 --> 00:31:34.581]  It's a creature of them, and the states are a creature of the people.
[00:31:34.981 --> 00:31:36.923]  It goes people, states, federal government.
[00:31:37.343 --> 00:31:43.348]  But first they said they were co-equal, just like the branches of government, and then now they say, oh, the president's the boss of everything.
[00:31:43.709 --> 00:31:47.212]  I mean, it's just completely backwards.
[00:31:48.052 --> 00:31:53.257]  And that's why we're seeing such a resistance throughout the United States, Alex, is because
[00:31:55.376 --> 00:31:55.656]  I don't
[00:32:18.334 --> 00:32:24.857]  You know, if you look at even Abraham Lincoln's statements regarding secession, he never denied that secession was a right.
[00:32:25.177 --> 00:32:28.519]  He only said that it had to be done through the consent of the states through the Union.
[00:32:29.039 --> 00:32:35.142]  And so, at the very least, Article 5 of the Constitution would provide the states with a method of seceding from the Union.
[00:32:35.942 --> 00:32:45.415]  So what we have today is even a distortion of what happened in the 1860s, which was never about the right of revolution or the right of secession in general.
[00:32:45.736 --> 00:32:49.962]  It was only about the way that the states succeeded specifically during that time.
[00:32:51.254 --> 00:33:04.829]  People who are holding this view that the Civil War passed to the Civil Government, all of this authority, without consent, without constitutional amendment, without due process or anything along those lines, they're stating a very serious flaw.
[00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:12.018]  But unfortunately, so many federal politicians have adopted that view, and they treat the states and the individuals accordingly.
[00:33:12.378 --> 00:33:31.317]  Yeah, they act like they're lords, they're King George III and we're the little serfs, but expanding on that, look, I've read what Lincoln said, I've studied the Civil War, it's not hard to find this information out, it's not like it's some secret, it's just it's not taught by the so-called mainstream deceptive media.
[00:33:32.205 --> 00:33:34.347]  But it had nothing to do with slavery.
[00:33:34.367 --> 00:33:36.488]  It was about who would control Western expansion.
[00:33:37.049 --> 00:33:41.673]  It was about unfair tariffs on the South that didn't affect the North.
[00:33:42.473 --> 00:33:48.838]  And the Lincoln quotes, you can type them into a search engine, Lincoln, I would unify the country without freeing one slave.
[00:33:49.379 --> 00:33:51.881]  There was very few slaves owned in the South.
[00:33:52.341 --> 00:33:54.162]  The institution was being phased out.
[00:33:54.563 --> 00:33:58.246]  That is a modern fiction to sell this Lincoln
[00:33:59.639 --> 00:34:08.306]  Had hundreds of newspaper editors arrested, members of Congress arrested, a total end of free speech, you know, the dictatorship of Lincoln and Stanton.
[00:34:09.423 --> 00:34:19.605]  Then for eight, nine years after the Civil War, I mean, people were murdered and raped and robbed all over the country, even in the West, had nothing to do with slavery, by federal troops.
[00:34:19.685 --> 00:34:22.625]  I mean, and the carpetbagger trains behind them.
[00:34:23.086 --> 00:34:29.067]  I mean, this was just another great example of pointless tyranny.
[00:34:29.647 --> 00:34:35.848]  And now they teach this fable today that the Civil War was about freeing black people.
[00:34:36.653 --> 00:34:43.018]  Yeah, and of course there's cultural context to the slavery issue in that day, and as you noted, it was on its way out for sure.
[00:34:43.058 --> 00:34:44.980]  I mean, the technology that was developing at that time...
[00:34:47.282 --> 00:34:51.284]  Allowing much more production without the use of individuals to do that.
[00:34:51.744 --> 00:34:53.885]  So, I mean, absolutely it was on its way out.
[00:34:53.965 --> 00:34:55.545]  It was a political issue.
[00:34:55.625 --> 00:35:05.329]  It was a matter of control over territories and the states believing that the federal government was not exercising its power for the general welfare.
[00:35:05.849 --> 00:35:07.490]  And so all that's a matter of history.
[00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:12.512]  Even Abraham Lincoln in his first inaugural address stated the issue pretty clearly.
[00:35:13.152 --> 00:35:19.256]  Politicians have adopted this idea that the federal laws trump state laws without regard to the 10th Amendment.
[00:35:20.877 --> 00:35:26.621]  It's being able to retain sovereignty over the matters they were supposed to retain sovereignty over.
[00:35:26.941 --> 00:35:37.348]  So we've seen over the past 100 years this gradual overtake of state sovereignty to the point now where the US Supreme Court, particularly through Clarence Thomas,
[00:35:38.766 --> 00:35:50.838]  Questioned this idea of the Commerce Clause and Congress's ability to regulate the states within the borders where their activity does not affect other states.
[00:35:50.919 --> 00:35:57.645]  And so they're questioning this long line of FDR stacked the courts during his administration.
[00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:59.150]  There is a shift.
[00:35:59.491 --> 00:36:11.617]  There is a shift of ideology that we're seeing take place, and it's through this natural evolutionary process of being able to retain individual liberty for our own self-preservation and self-improvement.
[00:36:11.637 --> 00:36:16.100]  Well sure, but just to be clear, it's bad enough to have a tyrannical federal government, but
[00:36:17.378 --> 00:36:31.918]  The people that run the federal government today, it's even worse, they're bought and paid for by globalists, by the very mega banks that have created all these global derivatives, and our military is simply there to backstop all that fraudulent paper and to collect off of us
[00:36:33.516 --> 00:36:34.897]  Debts that are not owed by us.
[00:36:34.917 --> 00:36:42.722]  I mean, they're telling us we've got to raise taxes and cut benefits and all this stuff because we owe, you know, $15 trillion.
[00:36:43.002 --> 00:36:46.504]  And I don't agree with the dependency and the $15 trillion.
[00:36:46.804 --> 00:36:50.946]  But it's nothing compared to the $664 million, the Washington Post says, of the global $1.5 quadrillion
[00:36:57.951 --> 00:37:20.190]  600 plus trillion that we've been signed on to that Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citibank created in the last 15 years or so and they've gotten the politicians to sign us on and now the bought and paid for mouthpieces in the media are telling the public you owe this money and the Federal Reserve and the central bankers they're trying to fix it.
[00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:23.473]  They're telling Europeans we're going to jack your taxes up to pay your debt
[00:37:24.093 --> 00:37:26.193]  And 90 plus percent of the debt isn't theirs.
[00:37:26.673 --> 00:37:29.194]  I mean, it's just such a giant fraud.
[00:37:29.234 --> 00:37:32.794]  So we've got to totally discredit this federal government.
[00:37:33.015 --> 00:37:34.655]  Because it's worse than a federal government.
[00:37:35.055 --> 00:37:39.576]  It is an occupational command base.
[00:37:40.656 --> 00:37:47.497]  That's why Ron Paul is so dangerous to their structure, to their platform, to their underpinnings of their system.
[00:37:48.137 --> 00:37:53.278]  Ron Paul under... They've done a good job over the years of trying to
[00:37:55.421 --> 00:38:04.706]  But they're not able to do that much anymore because of the big following that he has and just the sense that he makes and the historical knowledge he has regarding all those things that you just described.
[00:38:05.146 --> 00:38:11.770]  And that's another reason why, on the state level, we have to have governors in place who are willing to
[00:38:13.152 --> 00:38:41.778]  I signed into law state bank ordinances that would allow the people of the individual states to become independent of this Federal Reserve monstrosity where Congress and those who control them are controlling the money as they have been and getting us into debt as they have been and diminishing our asset value and the depreciation of the dollar itself to the point now where we're looking around and we're wondering
[00:38:42.498 --> 00:38:43.439]  You know, where's the future?
[00:38:43.479 --> 00:38:44.119]  We can't see it.
[00:38:44.539 --> 00:38:47.381]  And so we're having to go back to our defensible positions.
[00:38:48.021 --> 00:38:49.402]  Well, Tim Baldwin, great job.
[00:38:49.422 --> 00:39:01.370]  We're going to have to do a Part 2 of the interview with you in the next few weeks, getting into your book, Romans 13, that exposes how the system is using the preachers to tell people to submit to corrupt government, when obviously that's not in the Bible.
[00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:07.834]  One of the biggest problems we've got is that the churches have been taught to basically bow to tyranny, and you've done a great job along with your father doing that.
[00:39:07.854 --> 00:39:09.355]  I also look forward to getting your dad on about
[00:39:10.195 --> 00:39:12.137]  His run there in Montana.
[00:39:12.617 --> 00:39:15.119]  And where's the best place for people to find the Romans 13 book?
[00:39:16.039 --> 00:39:19.362]  Yeah, Alex, they can go to Romans13truth.com.
[00:39:19.382 --> 00:39:22.564]  That's Romans 13, the number, truth.com.
[00:39:22.604 --> 00:39:24.425]  And they can order that from that website.
[00:39:24.685 --> 00:39:25.266]  That's wonderful.
[00:39:25.286 --> 00:39:28.087]  We'll have to do a whole interview just on that coming up in the near future.
[00:39:28.107 --> 00:39:28.508]  Thank you, Tim.
[00:39:29.292 --> 00:39:29.853]  Thank you, Alex.
