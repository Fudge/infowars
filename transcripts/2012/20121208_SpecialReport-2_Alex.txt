[00:00:06.707 --> 00:00:13.349]  Alex Jones here to report on one of the most sickening displays of high-tech propaganda I have ever witnessed.
[00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:25.094]  Since the week of Thanksgiving, the airwaves have been bombarded with a commercial paid for and produced by JPMorgan Chase.
[00:00:25.834 --> 00:00:34.600]  Showing iconic images of soldiers returning home and the 9-11 attacks and people toasting each other over turkeys.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.922]  The very essence of Americana.
[00:00:36.942 --> 00:00:39.603]  Looks like it was directed by Steven Spielberg.
[00:00:40.184 --> 00:00:44.867]  Let's analyze and break down this sickening piece of propaganda.
[00:00:45.988 --> 00:00:50.331]  Let's give thanks for an idea.
[00:00:51.431 --> 00:00:53.733]  A grand idea called America.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.666]  Deathly conjuring an image that only existed in Norman Rockwell's America.
[00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:12.840]  We are then told, finally, that this image of a beautiful and strong America is brought to you by JPMorgan Chase, the very authors of our decline and eventual collapse.
[00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:31.889]  It is incredibly painful to see them putting out this pro-family, pro-America image so that they can brand themselves to it, so they can tie themselves to it, when they are at the heart of destroying our republic and taking this country into debt bondage.
[00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:34.270]  Let's analyze this piece a little bit further.
[00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:51.349]  Imagine the cold-blooded calculation that when you're all sitting around watching the football game after enjoying the turkey with your family, grandma's there, the grandchildren are there, the fire's going, and you're bombarded every 10 minutes, because I was watching football with family as well, with
[00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:52.910]  JPMorgan Chase.
[00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:53.990]  JPMorgan Chase.
[00:01:54.391 --> 00:01:55.812]  They bring you America.
[00:01:56.172 --> 00:01:57.853]  They bring you prosperity.
[00:01:58.153 --> 00:01:59.234]  They bring you freedom.
[00:01:59.514 --> 00:02:07.299]  When they are steering this country towards economic collapse, because that's how they conquer you, is by economic fraud.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:15.525]  They want you in debt to them for nothing but zeros and ones that they created fraudulently on their derivative sheet.
[00:02:15.925 --> 00:02:20.228]  In his farewell address to Congress, Ron Paul pointed out who the real enemy is.
[00:02:20.628 --> 00:02:21.329]  The megabanks.
[00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.971]  He called them authoritarian psychopaths.
[00:02:26.571 --> 00:02:32.134]  Psychopathic authoritarians endorse government-initiated force to change the world.
[00:02:32.774 --> 00:02:41.978]  He went on to point out the fact that when Americans lost their homes, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and others
[00:02:43.675 --> 00:02:44.055]  I think?
[00:03:03.351 --> 00:03:07.692]  The truth is that Wall Street regulates the Congress.
[00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:11.073]  They have untold, unlimited amounts of money.
[00:03:11.294 --> 00:03:14.194]  Money which they use, by the way, to get the deregulation.
[00:03:15.155 --> 00:03:18.016]  Then, they implode the economy in 2008.
[00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:24.297]  Threaten martial law if the government doesn't shine on to their too-big-to-fail derivatives.
[00:03:24.898 --> 00:03:26.318]  And they did the same thing in Europe.
[00:03:26.718 --> 00:03:29.919]  Three bailouts later, the people are more poor than ever.
[00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:31.880]  The taxes are sky-high.
[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.462]  And the tax money is going to Goldman Sachs, J.P.
[00:03:35.482 --> 00:03:39.145]  Morgan and others, who again brag that they've conquered the world.
[00:03:39.325 --> 00:03:42.647]  Aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[00:03:42.667 --> 00:03:46.110]  To answer your question, we are absolutely slaves to central banks.
[00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.053]  We'd love to be slaves to the economy, but the economic numbers continue to do nothing but...
[00:03:50.473 --> 00:03:52.534]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:03:52.634 --> 00:03:55.074]  Is it one world, the central bankers in charge?
[00:03:55.154 --> 00:04:05.337]  If authoritarianism leads to poverty and war and less freedom for all individuals, and is controlled by rich special interests, the people should be begging for liberty.
[00:04:05.797 --> 00:04:10.398]  I think it's important to also note that they say America is about being a free market.
[00:04:10.558 --> 00:04:15.380]  To free markets, free enterprise, and free refills.
[00:04:16.897 --> 00:04:26.843]  So JPMorgan Chase implies that they are free market when their entire business model is designed around government bailouts and government contracts.
[00:04:27.384 --> 00:04:34.548]  And when Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are at the core of pushing planned economies via Agenda 21,
[00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:49.705]  Their business model is shutting down their competition using government regulation and then exempting themselves from those regulations while becoming bloated on the blood, sweat, and tears of the American people via corporate welfare.
[00:04:50.606 --> 00:04:52.547]  The circumstances surrounding J.P.
[00:04:52.607 --> 00:04:55.369]  Morgan, how big an opportunity is this right now?
[00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:58.051]  The American people are angry at Wall Street.
[00:04:58.111 --> 00:04:58.771]  You know what they want?
[00:04:59.272 --> 00:05:03.394]  They want our financial institutions to invest in the real economy.
[00:05:03.875 --> 00:05:06.616]  They want Wall Street to be lending money to businesses.
[00:05:06.897 --> 00:05:07.257]  J.P.
[00:05:07.297 --> 00:05:10.119]  Morgan claims they want to get America moving in this ad.
[00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.861]  That they want to see that entrepreneurial spirit thrive.
[00:05:13.661 --> 00:05:28.057]  While making investments in China where they have no carbon tax, JP Morgan is at the center of driving a program to shut down the majority of power plants in the country and quote, bankrupt coal, which is projected to more than double the price of electricity.
[00:05:28.618 --> 00:05:38.088]  JPMorgan Chase and the other five megabanks are diametrically opposed to a real free market and a true system with competition and private property.
[00:05:38.329 --> 00:05:43.614]  They can only exist via a government license to operate their private Federal Reserve.
[00:05:44.175 --> 00:06:02.871]  While people like Jamie Dimon, who they're now pushing to be the new Treasury Secretary, sits on the highest levels of the private Federal Reserve Board while he sits as the head of JPMorgan Chase, giving trillions of dollars of free credit to himself and his shareholders.
[00:06:03.732 --> 00:06:08.394]  That gives a new meaning to conflict of interest and Fox guarding the hen house.
[00:06:08.874 --> 00:06:10.794]  And who owns the private Federal Reserve?
[00:06:11.415 --> 00:06:13.115]  The Rockefellers and the Rothschilds.
[00:06:13.836 --> 00:06:16.596]  12 years ago, they merged their banks.
[00:06:16.616 --> 00:06:19.437]  In 2012, they publicly merged their family fortunes.
[00:06:19.678 --> 00:06:21.758]  I'm not just talking to people in the United States.
[00:06:21.858 --> 00:06:23.379]  I'm talking to humans worldwide.
[00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:25.900]  We are under bankster occupation.
[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.241]  They think you're stupid.
[00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:29.442]  They think you don't understand finance.
[00:06:29.842 --> 00:06:31.924]  They think you don't understand what fraud is.
[00:06:32.304 --> 00:06:40.909]  This is a criminal takeover by a group of globalists that have given themselves unlimited capital through fiat fraudulent derivatives.
[00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:50.074]  I want to close with a quote by one of our greatest founding fathers, Thomas Jefferson, because he understood who the enemy was 230 plus years ago.
[00:06:51.835 --> 00:06:54.357]  We need to understand who the enemy is today.
[00:06:54.637 --> 00:07:11.332]  If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered.
[00:07:12.052 --> 00:07:16.573]  I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.
[00:07:17.233 --> 00:07:23.855]  The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs.
[00:07:24.475 --> 00:07:25.776]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:07:26.216 --> 00:07:27.516]  The issuing power.
[00:07:27.876 --> 00:07:38.199]  They can issue unlimited fraudulent derivatives paper and then have government sign on to the fraud they created and declare us their debt slaves.
[00:07:39.477 --> 00:07:46.411]  I'm Alex Jones for InfoWars.com, and if you are watching this transmission, remember, you are the resistance!
