[00:00:05.134 --> 00:00:09.955]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.955 --> 00:00:11.556]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.556 --> 00:00:13.096]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:17.277]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.277 --> 00:00:27.179]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.000]  I am so wound up this morning.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.861]  This afternoon, depending on what time zone you're listening to us in this evening.
[00:00:35.759 --> 00:01:02.879]  This morning, getting ready to come in to the Infowars Media Center, I sat there in a chair for about 15 minutes just staring at the wall, something I rarely do, trying to come up with words, descriptions to describe how incredibly fast the tyranny
[00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:07.365]  Is metastasizing.
[00:01:07.365 --> 00:01:24.909]  Just yesterday we talked about the new Homeland Security, cybersecurity legislation that all the major watchdog groups admit is the complete end of freedom on the web, the end of the Fourth Amendment, total Pentagon takeover of all telecommunications infrastructure.
[00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.390]  The CIA director publicly a month ago saying, yeah we listen and watch everything you do, get used to it.
[00:01:31.337 --> 00:01:36.838]  Government inoculating children in states across the union without parental consent.
[00:01:36.838 --> 00:01:39.539]  Giving children abortions without parental consent.
[00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.519]  All of it lawless and illegal.
[00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:46.240]  And now taking children from parents when they don't get vaccines.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.160]  No law.
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.761]  Absolute kidnapping.
[00:01:49.761 --> 00:01:55.162]  We do have a totally illegitimate criminal government.
[00:01:55.162 --> 00:01:59.483]  And lately I have been going to different churches in Austin trying them out.
[00:02:00.245 --> 00:02:11.874]  And also randomly going and looking at the sermons that Methodists, Baptists, interdenominational, Catholic, you name it, churches are giving.
[00:02:11.874 --> 00:02:21.122]  And I found that in the last two weeks, all over the country, they've been having clergy response team speeches.
[00:02:22.526 --> 00:02:33.134]  That of course is FEMA's secret program now declassified a few years ago to get most of the clergy in the country to spy on their flock and to basically become government agents.
[00:02:33.134 --> 00:02:37.758]  My wife went to a church to try it out this weekend with the children.
[00:02:37.758 --> 00:02:39.940]  I told her I just can't handle being around people right now.
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.862]  I need some time, just a few hours where I'm not being looked at.
[00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:44.463]  I said I'm going to stay home.
[00:02:51.024 --> 00:02:53.407]  Work on stuff, exercise, but also pray.
[00:02:53.407 --> 00:02:56.430]  I've been doing a lot more praying lately, I'll tell you.
[00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.033]  There are no atheists in foxholes.
[00:02:59.033 --> 00:03:03.477]  Or maybe they are, just I don't know them.
[00:03:03.477 --> 00:03:09.223]  And she gets home and I said, how was the sermon?
[00:03:09.223 --> 00:03:11.586]  And she said, it was cop worship.
[00:03:15.305 --> 00:03:32.418]  And again, it's not that some police aren't really good men and women and don't lay their lives down and don't have tough jobs, but it's the system programming what breachers say, the federal government, and getting everybody ready to do whatever the police say under martial law.
[00:03:32.418 --> 00:03:41.805]  That's the whole point, is that it's a synthetic, artificial, hollow thing as well, because they don't care about the military and the police.
[00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:44.347]  In fact, the system hates them and treats them like trash.
[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.563]  You know, when legal aliens, drug smugglers with U.S.
[00:03:48.563 --> 00:03:55.068]  Justice Department furnished guns kill a cop, they don't have a parade, anything.
[00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:57.791]  It's kept real quiet, the family's paid off.
[00:03:57.791 --> 00:04:04.676]  But a cop gets killed by somebody on psychotropic drugs in Austin, you'd think the world had come to the end.
[00:04:04.676 --> 00:04:13.004]  And now I've talked to people that didn't know, I actually have a mutual friend that knew this police officer and said, well, one reason was he was a really nice guy, everybody liked him.
[00:04:13.942 --> 00:04:15.983]  So, I understand that.
[00:04:15.983 --> 00:04:21.187]  The point is, is that the system uses it.
[00:04:21.187 --> 00:04:25.570]  Why are they selling us on worshipping the government and the police and the military?
[00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.732]  That's what fascist states do.
[00:04:28.732 --> 00:04:36.738]  In the Americana system, you've never had the military off-duty encouraged to be out in their uniforms.
[00:04:36.738 --> 00:04:42.942]  Because our military and our government and our citizens knew, oh, that's what you see in third world countries.
[00:04:45.165 --> 00:04:49.393]  But now it's everywhere to get us ready to live in a military state.
[00:04:49.393 --> 00:04:52.299]  Military is a very dangerous thing.
[00:04:52.299 --> 00:04:55.064]  I'm gonna break down some of the biggest news ever on the other side.
[00:04:55.064 --> 00:04:55.485]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.533 --> 00:05:03.255]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:03.255 --> 00:05:08.561]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:05:08.561 --> 00:05:10.103]  Saving means to make money.
[00:05:10.103 --> 00:05:18.893]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:05:19.614 --> 00:05:27.138]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:05:27.138 --> 00:05:35.142]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:05:35.142 --> 00:05:40.385]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:05:40.385 --> 00:05:42.546]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:05:45.327 --> 00:05:48.532]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.

[00:06:00.131 --> 00:06:01.432]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:01.432 --> 00:06:07.015]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:06:07.015 --> 00:06:12.038]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:17.622]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:06:17.622 --> 00:06:22.305]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:06:22.825 --> 00:06:29.952]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:06:29.952 --> 00:06:31.073]  And here's the best part.
[00:06:31.073 --> 00:06:37.759]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:40.942]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:44.105]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:06:47.748 --> 00:06:51.971]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:06:51.971 --> 00:06:56.793]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:06:56.793 --> 00:07:00.776]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:07:00.776 --> 00:07:15.225]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:20.931]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:20.931 --> 00:07:33.695]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:07:33.695 --> 00:07:40.958]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:07:41.658 --> 00:07:52.029]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:07:52.029 --> 00:07:55.953]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:07:55.953 --> 00:07:59.057]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[00:08:01.966 --> 00:08:08.595]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.595 --> 00:08:11.580]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:22.677 --> 00:08:27.222]  We are broadcasting worldwide in defense of liberty.
[00:08:27.222 --> 00:08:28.403]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:08:28.403 --> 00:08:40.815]  This is an emergency global transmission attempting to reach fellow humans worldwide that understand a scientific dictatorship being carried out by six global private megabanks is waging war.
[00:08:41.776 --> 00:08:55.260]  Against the Free Market Society, private property, the family, in a scientifically prepared, planned, and public program for a New World Order eugenics Agenda 21 takeover.
[00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.901]  We are in the process of being completely conquered.
[00:08:58.901 --> 00:09:01.582]  We're already geographically conquered.
[00:09:01.582 --> 00:09:03.303]  We're already conquered for the private
[00:09:04.659 --> 00:09:07.841]  Federal Reserve and its collection agency, the IRS, financially.
[00:09:07.841 --> 00:09:15.825]  But now they're going after our bodies, our minds, with the chemicals, biologicals, the chemtrails, the weather manipulation.
[00:09:15.825 --> 00:09:24.469]  We have a group of control freak psychos, whose megalomania, thanks to technology, is now being manifest.
[00:09:24.469 --> 00:09:28.651]  Nero thought he was God, but he wasn't God, and he didn't have nuclear weapons.
[00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:30.972]  Caligula thought he was God, the Roman Emperor.
[00:09:30.972 --> 00:09:32.513]  Aztec kings thought they were God.
[00:09:35.282 --> 00:09:58.610]  Now, the elite do have what you could call God-like power through the nuclear weapons, the fission weapons, the tectonic weapons, the biological weapons, for all intents and purposes, not like God with a big G, but God little G, like the Greek gods, to devastate
[00:09:59.847 --> 00:10:02.588]  Devastate this planet and devastate humanity.
[00:10:02.588 --> 00:10:14.392]  They've had a covert attack profile creeping around poisoning the food, the water, the medicines, the Trojan Horse vaccine program.
[00:10:14.392 --> 00:10:24.636]  They have tested their soft kill up to a point where they're just devastating the population in mass, just mass death, disease, neurological disorders, cancer.
[00:10:25.856 --> 00:10:29.898]  Autism, everything off the charts.
[00:10:29.898 --> 00:10:33.920]  Barbie, Cancer Barbie, who's had her hair fall out.
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.362]  Oh, let's be sweet to the kids and, you know, give them a Barbie because they've got cancer.
[00:10:37.362 --> 00:10:39.463]  The point is, why are they all getting cancer?
[00:10:39.463 --> 00:10:42.245]  Why is everybody getting breast cancer?
[00:10:42.245 --> 00:10:43.625]  Not, let's get a cure for it.
[00:10:43.625 --> 00:10:44.566]  Why is it exploding?
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.462]  To again, normalize it.
[00:10:47.462 --> 00:10:54.030]  That way they can control the movement on breast cancer, and pediatric cancer, and brain cancer, and lung cancer.
[00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:57.994]  You know lung cancer's up in non-smokers?
[00:10:57.994 --> 00:11:01.719]  It's directly linked to cancer viruses and what, four major vaccines still being given?
[00:11:03.561 --> 00:11:07.924]  You're like, Alex, you open every show with this, because that's the big issue.
[00:11:07.924 --> 00:11:11.947]  Whether you're military, police, or bureaucrats that serve this system.
[00:11:11.947 --> 00:11:17.711]  You were not given the memo that Angela Merkel was not to take the vaccines.
[00:11:17.711 --> 00:11:19.452]  Oh, those memos did come out three years ago.
[00:11:19.452 --> 00:11:23.295]  The US governing elite, the British governing elite,
[00:11:24.485 --> 00:11:30.250]  The Chinese, the Japanese, the European Union elite, none of them will take the vaccines.
[00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:32.953]  The memos are public not to take them.
[00:11:32.953 --> 00:11:46.546]  I've shown you stacks of news reports, I just got chills, where the Chinese elite have secret farms producing only non-GMO with genetic testing being done on the spot to make sure cross-pollination hasn't happened.
[00:11:47.284 --> 00:11:48.844]  Why do you think that's going on?
[00:11:48.844 --> 00:11:58.367]  Because they've implemented eugenics operations in China as part of a deal with the globalists to move the New World Order to China that they signed in the mid-1970s and they would carry out the eugenics model.
[00:11:58.367 --> 00:12:07.829]  Their elite did join with the New World Order.
[00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:08.989]  Just got chills again.
[00:12:10.786 --> 00:12:13.809]  All of the elite with their own private gardens and food.
[00:12:13.809 --> 00:12:15.490]  Special water filtration systems.
[00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:19.394]  Special filtration systems on their houses and now automobiles.
[00:12:19.394 --> 00:12:25.059]  Aircraft flying around behind them when they jet set with the chefs and the food grown at their facilities.
[00:12:25.059 --> 00:12:25.679]  Why is that?
[00:12:26.584 --> 00:12:42.862]  Well, the memos of the German government got leaked that the entire upper government class does not take vaccines and is offered, quote, translated from German into English, clean vaccines if they want them.
[00:12:42.862 --> 00:12:44.764]  That's London Guardian Der Spiegel.
[00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:46.606]  Look it up.
[00:12:46.606 --> 00:12:47.627]  They give you the message again.
[00:12:48.775 --> 00:13:16.790]  If you're a servant of this system and have decided to join with the tyranny, you're conscious of its evil, you know it's real, but as a coward or someone who's selfish and only wants to continue having fun today, and strutting around like a peacock today and partying today and having the petty power of the system today, you are being killed right now!
[00:13:18.564 --> 00:13:22.127]  The things we're gonna see in the near future.
[00:13:22.127 --> 00:13:24.610]  People are like, what are we gonna see?
[00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:25.591]  Government-run healthcare?
[00:13:25.591 --> 00:13:27.372]  TSA sticking their hands on our pants?
[00:13:27.372 --> 00:13:28.333]  Forced inoculations?
[00:13:28.333 --> 00:13:30.175]  Remember I told you all that was coming?
[00:13:30.175 --> 00:13:32.817]  And now it's here, and it's like, so what?
[00:13:32.817 --> 00:13:35.420]  When's it gonna get bad, Alex?
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:39.904]  It's only gonna get worse because you can't recognize what's bad.
[00:13:39.904 --> 00:13:43.628]  I mean, when I sit there, I sat there,
[00:13:45.094 --> 00:14:00.367]  For like 10-15 minutes, just staring at the wall today, trying to think of all the things they're doing and how they all tie together, and it was like trying to look at grains of sand at the beach and describe each one of them.
[00:14:00.367 --> 00:14:02.770]  You ever picked up grains of sand and put them under a microscope?
[00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:04.451]  They're beautiful.
[00:14:04.451 --> 00:14:09.936]  Some are orange, some are red, some are blue, some are green, most are white, depending on the beach you go to.
[00:14:09.936 --> 00:14:10.857]  They look like diamonds.
[00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:14.150]  But it's the opposite.
[00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:21.793]  You zoom in on the New World Order and it gets uglier and more complex the closer you get in on it.
[00:14:21.793 --> 00:14:32.037]  It is a wavelength, a spectrum of corruption and evil and enslavement and degradation and humiliation and pain.
[00:14:32.037 --> 00:14:34.358]  It is trampling and being trampled upon.
[00:14:35.273 --> 00:14:43.976]  By the priest of power, the cult of power, who only care about ugliness and black uniforms and trudgeons and pain and starving children.
[00:14:43.976 --> 00:14:46.397]  That is beautiful to them.
[00:14:46.397 --> 00:15:02.043]  That is what is beautiful to us, Winston, O'Brien says, as he tortures Winston Smith, who was a archetype of George Orwell, aka Eric Blair, who'd worked in propaganda for MI6 at the BBC.
[00:15:07.725 --> 00:15:27.940]  When good men do nothing, when good men and women stand down and decide that the whole world is just like a carnival and that you're a spectator and you just go through the world and react to what is fed to you, when you do that, you automatically allow the very worst elements to take control of the culture.
[00:15:29.878 --> 00:15:35.141]  And these globalists hate humanity and enjoy ugliness and pain and raw power.
[00:15:35.141 --> 00:15:49.511]  They love raw power so much they have taken their sweet cold time taking over the system while profiting at the same time and now they prepare to have their absolute total world government system.
[00:15:49.511 --> 00:15:54.334]  I'm going to describe to you right now what the cashless society control grid system is going to be like.
[00:15:55.216 --> 00:15:56.858]  We're already into it.
[00:15:56.858 --> 00:16:13.252]  I told you 15 years ago, I told you 10 years ago, I told you 5 years ago, I've issued messages to the future, for people down the road, and now people are already going back to messages from 15 years ago, 5 years ago, and freaking out, going, look at this message, that's now what happened.
[00:16:13.252 --> 00:16:15.174]  How does Alex Jones know this?
[00:16:15.174 --> 00:16:17.877]  Because I study the enemy.
[00:16:19.591 --> 00:16:22.633]  And every time I even think about the enemy, I get chills.
[00:16:22.633 --> 00:16:29.999]  Not chills of fear, chills of, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, you know, like, ooooh, in a spook house.
[00:16:29.999 --> 00:16:41.527]  You're out in the woods at night, feel like something brushes up against you, get those chills, ooooh, danger Will Robinson, ooooh, bad, bad.
[00:16:41.527 --> 00:16:44.929]  And my instinct isn't run, my instinct is warn people.
[00:16:44.929 --> 00:16:48.332]  My instinct is, good men, let's rally, let's defeat this.
[00:16:52.935 --> 00:16:57.157]  Gives me the willies.
[00:16:57.157 --> 00:16:58.818]  That's really the best description of it.
[00:16:58.818 --> 00:17:00.218]  I have the willies right now.
[00:17:00.218 --> 00:17:15.645]  And it's not the willies you get when you're crazy and in college and you drive out 10 miles out into the ocean at night when it's super smooth and there's
[00:17:19.113 --> 00:17:26.375]  Fish swimming around your boat and you just jump in and swim out a few hundred yards.
[00:17:26.375 --> 00:17:32.857]  Because if you're conscious and analyze the fear, statistically it's a very low chance that a barracuda or a shark is going to bite you.
[00:17:32.857 --> 00:17:38.499]  Let's be conservative, 1 out of 10 million.
[00:17:38.499 --> 00:17:38.959]  Look it up.
[00:17:38.959 --> 00:17:42.540]  I mean, I think you've got like a 1 out of 15 million last time I checked and change.
[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.441]  You're being even bitten by a shark in a year.
[00:17:45.526 --> 00:17:46.287]  Look it up yourself.
[00:17:46.287 --> 00:17:46.967]  The numbers vary.
[00:17:46.967 --> 00:17:50.029]  There's like four or five shark fatalities a year.
[00:17:50.029 --> 00:17:52.411]  My point is, you got the willies.
[00:17:52.411 --> 00:17:56.193]  I mean, I remember doing stuff like that and most of my buddies wouldn't jump off the boat.
[00:17:56.193 --> 00:17:57.775]  And they're like, quit showing off.
[00:17:57.775 --> 00:18:00.116]  And I'm like, it's crystal clear out here.
[00:18:00.116 --> 00:18:05.080]  Look, there's plankton shining in the water.
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:05.880]  It's magic.
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.722]  Get in.
[00:18:08.722 --> 00:18:10.343]  And then one time we had girls with us.
[00:18:10.343 --> 00:18:12.365]  They pulled their clothes off and jumped in.
[00:18:13.783 --> 00:18:15.646]  They knew it was fun.
[00:18:15.646 --> 00:18:20.011]  The point is that those are irrational fears.
[00:18:20.011 --> 00:18:29.925]  I don't have the willies, unless there's jellyfish out there, that's a real threat, of jumping into black water ten miles off the coast at midnight.
[00:18:31.983 --> 00:18:43.852]  But my instincts, my intellect, everything, when I look at the New World Order, it is desperate sorrow that people don't know how serious it is, how giant, how hardcore, how massive.
[00:18:45.623 --> 00:18:48.944]  It doesn't come to steal and rob.
[00:18:48.944 --> 00:18:58.806]  It steals and robs to impoverish you, to make you weak, so it can enslave you, use you up, and ultimately get away with killing you.
[00:18:58.806 --> 00:19:07.029]  This whole global spectrum world government pinnacle system is chains to chain down humanity.
[00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:08.189]  An iron curtain.
[00:19:09.375 --> 00:19:17.584]  Of night and of total tyranny is descending upon every nation on earth right now the globalists have taken over.
[00:19:17.584 --> 00:19:26.954]  The New World Order goes into countries and wrecks the infrastructure and never rebuilds it.
[00:19:26.954 --> 00:19:29.677]  And brings poverty and mass death.
[00:19:29.677 --> 00:19:31.059]  That is its fruits.
[00:19:32.273 --> 00:19:38.415]  And if you think the New World Order won't and doesn't plan to do that here, you got another thing coming.
[00:19:38.415 --> 00:19:48.117]  They hate America more than any other place in the world, but they at the same time use America to carry out their evil.
[00:19:48.117 --> 00:19:55.779]  They destroy those without, while destroying the system within, while transferring their new command base to China.
[00:19:55.779 --> 00:19:56.719]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:56.719 --> 00:19:59.480]  I will give you the huge news of the IRS coup.
[00:20:00.703 --> 00:20:02.104]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:20:02.104 --> 00:20:12.770]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:16.853]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[00:20:17.213 --> 00:20:19.976]  But we can't do that without your help.
[00:20:19.976 --> 00:20:31.247]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[00:20:31.247 --> 00:20:34.410]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:40.874]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[00:20:40.874 --> 00:20:50.759]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[00:20:50.759 --> 00:20:52.260]  The war is here.
[00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.161]  It's an info war.
[00:20:54.161 --> 00:20:55.922]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[00:21:00.445 --> 00:21:06.407]  HempUSA.org has moved and expanded its operations for faster worldwide shipping.
[00:21:06.407 --> 00:21:11.929]  Our product line has grown from 5 to nearly 100 items in less than 5 years.

[00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:20.531]  Great for daily intake and perfect for your emergency storage shelter.

[00:21:29.594 --> 00:21:38.920]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:39.721]  This capitalism?
[00:21:39.721 --> 00:21:45.985]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:21:45.985 --> 00:21:46.866]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:46.866 --> 00:21:50.128]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[00:23:49.449 --> 00:23:50.329]  I was a highway man.
[00:23:50.329 --> 00:23:51.630]  Along the coach roads I did ride.
[00:24:12.585 --> 00:24:14.366]  But I am still alive!
[00:24:14.366 --> 00:24:18.808]  The adventurer, the patriot, the honorable,
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:46.703]  Our ancestors lived through all of you out there.
[00:24:46.703 --> 00:24:51.865]  The question is, what will you do in this great time of challenge?
[00:24:51.865 --> 00:24:54.506]  What are you made of?
[00:24:54.506 --> 00:25:04.371]  The globalist tricks and the different layers of confusion they project, do you get caught in their false reality or do you understand the manipulation?
[00:25:04.371 --> 00:25:08.473]  Because once you understand it, you laugh at yourself at how obvious it was.
[00:25:10.472 --> 00:25:27.702]  I've got all this world news, we have a big guest coming up, several big guests, but I want to just first calmly talk about something I've been talking about for a week.
[00:25:27.702 --> 00:25:33.866]  But upon stumbling across a rebroadcast of last Thursday's show on YouTube,
[00:25:35.111 --> 00:25:37.513]  I didn't give it the gravitas it needed.
[00:25:37.513 --> 00:25:42.576]  I didn't give people the full spectrum breakdown that is so essential.
[00:25:42.576 --> 00:25:45.398]  I mean, in and of itself, it's horrible.
[00:25:45.398 --> 00:25:52.162]  And another signpost on the road to absolute enslavement and all that that word enslavement means.
[00:25:53.868 --> 00:25:58.189]  But then there's the media response and how they report on it like it's no big deal.
[00:25:58.189 --> 00:26:00.430]  There's that whole story.
[00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:03.671]  And then there's how it ties into everything else.
[00:26:03.671 --> 00:26:13.174]  And I sat there on the phone with Paul Watson this morning, who's doing a story on it, and who's listening right now to get some of my points to add to his research.
[00:26:13.174 --> 00:26:21.216]  And that's what I stood there, basically staring at the wall, thinking about all the hundreds of different points that come up when I think about this.
[00:26:23.342 --> 00:26:25.043]  And the historical ramifications.
[00:26:25.043 --> 00:26:30.125]  And of course, I'm speaking about the IRS coup over our Republic.
[00:26:30.125 --> 00:26:31.826]  And that's what it is.
[00:26:31.826 --> 00:26:38.049]  The Federal Reserve began its coup d'etat over the financial system and its infiltration and slow takeover.
[00:26:38.049 --> 00:26:43.131]  Because if you had a foreign army come in and declare a coup, Americans would resist it.
[00:26:43.131 --> 00:26:49.334]  But infiltration by stealth, that's how we were attacked and that's how we were taken over.
[00:26:49.334 --> 00:26:52.376]  And now they're just mopping up free speech, the right to assemble,
[00:26:54.537 --> 00:26:59.099]  Private property rights, things like that.
[00:26:59.099 --> 00:27:02.100]  That's being mopped up right now.
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:04.761]  And so I was rereading these articles last night and this morning.
[00:27:04.761 --> 00:27:10.363]  Here's Forbes from April 7th, a week ago or more.
[00:27:10.363 --> 00:27:12.244]  Forget travel if you owe the IRS.
[00:27:12.244 --> 00:27:13.164]  Here's another one.
[00:27:13.164 --> 00:27:14.705]  Owe the IRS, you're not going anywhere.
[00:27:14.705 --> 00:27:19.007]  Fox News.
[00:27:19.007 --> 00:27:20.107]  Okay?
[00:27:20.107 --> 00:27:22.468]  And I've got some more articles going over that.
[00:27:26.266 --> 00:27:44.406]  And the way this Robert W. Wood just calmly talks about, well, they've had some similar things, you know, where you got to pay your child support or they take your paycheck or to get a hunting license if you got any problems.
[00:27:44.406 --> 00:27:45.588]  You can't get a hunting license.
[00:27:45.588 --> 00:27:46.188]  It's a privilege.
[00:27:47.099 --> 00:27:49.921]  So it's just like, oh, it's just something new, it's no big deal.
[00:27:49.921 --> 00:28:00.348]  Not even Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia, the worst despotisms, didn't take passports for unpaid taxes.
[00:28:00.348 --> 00:28:01.429]  They took them from people
[00:28:02.816 --> 00:28:03.877]  As part of a process.
[00:28:03.877 --> 00:28:08.121]  They learned that if you just came and arrested people to take them away to a slave labor camp, they'd resist.
[00:28:08.121 --> 00:28:18.451]  But if you first took their passport, only arrested their neighbors, came back a month later and said, now go live in this slum, this ghetto, and then a year later come get you and take you away.
[00:28:18.451 --> 00:28:21.213]  The process.
[00:28:21.213 --> 00:28:25.497]  And the globalists have written psychological warfare manuals that are public on this.
[00:28:25.497 --> 00:28:26.879]  They create a process.
[00:28:32.048 --> 00:28:37.872]  And so, they're just, oh yeah, you just won't be able to leave the country.
[00:28:37.872 --> 00:28:43.256]  Of course, I've read deeper into what they've called for.
[00:28:43.256 --> 00:28:44.898]  I've told you this is coming for years.
[00:28:44.898 --> 00:28:47.079]  Now it's here.
[00:28:47.079 --> 00:28:49.621]  You're not going to be able to buy or sell.
[00:28:49.621 --> 00:28:51.883]  This is not the Bible saying it.
[00:28:51.883 --> 00:28:55.886]  It's the Federal Reserve that runs our country and its collection agency, the IRS.
[00:28:55.886 --> 00:28:59.929]  You're not going to be able to have a job, go in a national park, go in a federal building,
[00:29:00.831 --> 00:29:05.412]  That's why they're now setting up TSA checkpoints outside social security buildings and others.
[00:29:05.412 --> 00:29:11.514]  And they're saying if your card isn't up to date, you're just homeless.
[00:29:11.514 --> 00:29:18.255]  Extrajudicial, no courts, no due process, just like over 2 million people are on no-fly list.
[00:29:18.255 --> 00:29:21.056]  Don't know how you got on, don't know how you get off.
[00:29:24.611 --> 00:29:32.712]  It's the national security state run by mafia criminals who are involved in every abominable crime you can imagine publicly.
[00:29:32.712 --> 00:29:46.155]  People like Corzine saying you're going to give all your money to the foreign banks that run your country through austerity and to Warren Buffett or you're not going to have a job and next we're going to come arrest you and put you in a forced labor camp.
[00:29:46.155 --> 00:29:46.515]  Stay there.
[00:29:46.515 --> 00:29:49.875]  I'm going to break it down how they're going to do it.
[00:29:49.875 --> 00:29:51.276]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.276 --> 00:29:52.776]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.803 --> 00:29:56.468]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:04.181]  Four, five, six, even seven dollars a gallon?
[00:30:04.181 --> 00:30:10.183]  According to fuel industry insiders and economic experts, those are the forecasted fuel prices, with no end in sight.

[00:31:28.063 --> 00:31:28.643]  I think so.
[00:31:48.268 --> 00:31:49.348]  I had tried everything.
[00:31:49.348 --> 00:31:50.909]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:53.389]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[00:31:53.389 --> 00:31:56.290]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:57.250]  And as soon as I had that,
[00:32:13.755 --> 00:32:18.897]  I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[00:32:18.897 --> 00:32:30.100]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:34.582]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[00:32:34.582 --> 00:32:40.844]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:32:40.844 --> 00:32:41.984]  Now, that's results.

[00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:59.071]  InfoWarsTeam.com
[00:33:07.614 --> 00:33:22.723]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:33:22.723 --> 00:33:25.305]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:47.747]  All right, let me break down what capital controls and martial law mean in America.
[00:33:47.747 --> 00:34:01.958]  And what it signifies to have the fact that the Senate has passed, it's moving quickly to the House, it is expected to pass, and there is no opposition on talk radio or in print that I have seen in a week of research.
[00:34:03.595 --> 00:34:16.925]  This legislation has been introduced for months and I wasn't even aware of it until it passed out of committee in the Senate and now passed the General Senate.
[00:34:16.925 --> 00:34:19.947]  I wasn't aware of it, someone who is a complete news junkie.
[00:34:21.243 --> 00:34:40.426]  Just like Obama signed an executive order to seize control of natural gas and try to keep us from using it as an energy source, listing it as some type of threat and trying to take state regulation power away, like the Texas Railroad Commission has over natural gas, I'd actually talked to some mid-level executives.
[00:34:40.426 --> 00:34:42.227]  They said these rumblings were coming.
[00:34:42.227 --> 00:34:49.688]  Two years ago, while everybody was diverted with the hooker scandal down in South America with Obama,
[00:34:50.748 --> 00:34:57.153]  And the Secret Service, he snuck another weekend executive order in on us.
[00:34:57.153 --> 00:35:06.481]  Just like the National Defense Authorization Act, the torture, the new wars, all of it.
[00:35:06.481 --> 00:35:16.449]  Now continuing here, the public plan by the big corporations and all their press releases and governments,
[00:35:17.904 --> 00:35:33.655]  ...is to standardize all electronics, including inexpensive clock radios, systems in refrigerators, light bulbs, everything, to have tech embedded in it that allows it to be remote controlled by government smart meters.
[00:35:34.738 --> 00:35:35.999]  This is all on record.
[00:35:35.999 --> 00:35:39.181]  MIT said it was the plan 12, 13 years ago.
[00:35:39.181 --> 00:35:39.961]  I first read about it.
[00:35:39.961 --> 00:35:41.422]  People are like, yeah, right.
[00:35:41.422 --> 00:35:44.404]  Our light bulbs and toasters are going to be watching us.
[00:35:44.404 --> 00:35:54.090]  Then you saw Forbes and Reuters and Wired Magazine a month ago say, yes, all new appliances spy on you.
[00:35:54.090 --> 00:36:00.154]  But it's not just a smart meter on your house or in the neighborhood wirelessly accessing it.
[00:36:00.154 --> 00:36:01.615]  On record.
[00:36:01.615 --> 00:36:02.336]  All of the
[00:36:07.079 --> 00:36:10.682]  Post office vehicles are now going to have these snooper hubs installed.
[00:36:10.682 --> 00:36:12.824]  That's Associated Press last year.
[00:36:12.824 --> 00:36:14.185]  All of them.
[00:36:14.185 --> 00:36:15.826]  That's the plan.
[00:36:15.826 --> 00:36:29.797]  And data over Powerline, the new chips are coming out that you pay for when you buy the refrigerator, the toaster, the microwave oven, the refrigerator, the dishwasher, the computer, the smartphone, the iPad,
[00:36:31.153 --> 00:36:40.782]  All of them have back doors, remote access, even when they're turned off, under federal regulations, which they call law.
[00:36:40.782 --> 00:36:42.704]  Okay?
[00:36:42.704 --> 00:36:48.009]  And Petraeus just says, hey, get used to it, the Fourth Amendment isn't seen as it was in the past.
[00:36:48.009 --> 00:36:51.112]  He didn't say, we're gonna ignore it, he just said, the Fourth Amendment allows this.
[00:36:51.112 --> 00:36:54.215]  Oh yeah, without a warrant, coming into your house.
[00:36:55.205 --> 00:36:57.607]  And again, gathering data on everyone.
[00:36:57.607 --> 00:36:58.667]  And you're like, well, I have nothing to hide.
[00:36:58.667 --> 00:37:00.548]  Do you have something to hide from serial killers?
[00:37:00.548 --> 00:37:03.510]  Do you have something, I mean, why do you lock your doors if you have nothing to hide?
[00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:05.251]  Because there's bad people out there.
[00:37:05.251 --> 00:37:07.213]  Government's the number one killer.
[00:37:07.213 --> 00:37:09.034]  Demo side.
[00:37:09.034 --> 00:37:12.936]  Look it up.
[00:37:12.936 --> 00:37:14.697]  You're always taught to be scared of your neighbor.
[00:37:14.697 --> 00:37:16.859]  You're always taught to be scared of anybody but government.
[00:37:16.859 --> 00:37:21.121]  When government, as our founders stated, is the number one threat.
[00:37:21.121 --> 00:37:23.463]  So here's our top news today.
[00:37:26.365 --> 00:37:36.992]  The IRS has stated, the collection agency of the private Federal Reserve, that we pay our taxes to, as Ronald Reagan's own commission showed, not one cent goes around the country, it's all interest on the debt.
[00:37:36.992 --> 00:37:50.180]  The debt to plant a dollar, which is really a Federal Reserve note, debt is created, paid to the private banks.
[00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:51.921]  We didn't have this until 1913.
[00:37:51.921 --> 00:37:53.542]  They hadn't completely phased it in until the 70s.
[00:37:55.350 --> 00:38:05.255]  They didn't really have the income tax in force until the 50s.
[00:38:05.255 --> 00:38:06.836]  United States of America.
[00:38:06.836 --> 00:38:19.242]  It says that on this $5 Lincoln-Greenback reissued by Kennedy, but at the top it says United States note, not Federal Reserve note.
[00:38:19.242 --> 00:38:20.723]  That is the difference.
[00:38:22.173 --> 00:38:25.199]  United States note, but look at the money in your wallet.
[00:38:25.199 --> 00:38:28.024]  It's a Federal Reserve note.
[00:38:28.024 --> 00:38:33.012]  The IRS was set up at the exact same time to fund this scam.
[00:38:34.397 --> 00:38:42.742]  And that's why Warren Buffett is out saying raise taxes on the rich because he has helped himself write the loopholes where he is exempt.
[00:38:42.742 --> 00:38:53.149]  Then he uses the fact he's exempt to say raise it on people over $250,000 a year so that he'll get that money out of the Treasury and banker bailouts and they even admit that.
[00:38:53.149 --> 00:38:55.350]  I covered that yesterday on the Sunday Show.
[00:38:55.350 --> 00:39:00.533]  How Buffett rule would still be escaped by highest earning households.
[00:39:00.533 --> 00:39:01.634]  And the Washington Post admits it.
[00:39:03.237 --> 00:39:04.458]  Here's one independent headline.
[00:39:04.458 --> 00:39:11.400]  Goldman Sachs conquers Europe.
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:24.646]  Raising taxes, bankrupting everybody except the elites to transfer the money to them because the government traders signed on to the fiat derivative debts created by Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and others.
[00:39:25.768 --> 00:39:29.869]  And again, I keep repeating that because that's the giant elephant in the room.
[00:39:29.869 --> 00:39:31.890]  That's the huge hoax.
[00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:38.151]  And then this smirking Warren Buffett trying to act non-threatening in every photo I see with an ice cream.
[00:39:38.151 --> 00:39:40.132]  Oh, it's the nice old man with an ice cream.
[00:39:40.132 --> 00:39:49.874]  Folks, evil doesn't look like Jeffrey Dahmer or Freddy Krueger or Jason from Friday the 13th.
[00:39:49.874 --> 00:39:51.554]  Or the killer from Halloween.
[00:39:51.554 --> 00:39:53.275]  Or the monsters from the movie Alien.
[00:39:55.257 --> 00:40:03.559]  Evil looks like little old men in suits who know to look non-threatening and go, I'm a nice old man, raise my taxes.
[00:40:03.559 --> 00:40:08.860]  When he knows full well he helped get rid of Glass-Steagall and he was the biggest beneficiary of the bailout money.
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.460]  Here that is out of McClatchy.
[00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:14.121]  Buffett, champion of bailout, is also leading beneficiary.
[00:40:14.121 --> 00:40:17.722]  And I know I keep hammering on this before I get to the IRS because
[00:40:18.786 --> 00:40:21.968]  People say, well, the IRS is a little out of control, but you gotta pay your share.
[00:40:21.968 --> 00:40:24.730]  You know, we've always had taxes.
[00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:26.552]  Death and taxes.
[00:40:26.552 --> 00:40:29.534]  All this talk.
[00:40:29.534 --> 00:40:32.656]  Yeah, we've always had tariffs and trade and sales taxes and things.
[00:40:32.656 --> 00:40:34.378]  We didn't always have property taxes.
[00:40:34.378 --> 00:40:35.739]  That's feudal surf tax.
[00:40:35.739 --> 00:40:36.980]  You don't own your land.
[00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:40.522]  We didn't have one until the 50s in this country.
[00:40:40.522 --> 00:40:42.083]  You used to really own your property.
[00:40:42.083 --> 00:40:43.144]  You don't own your land.
[00:40:43.144 --> 00:40:43.985]  You rent it.
[00:40:43.985 --> 00:40:46.507]  You pay government rent.
[00:40:46.507 --> 00:40:47.868]  And they'll take it if you don't.
[00:40:48.979 --> 00:40:56.182]  And you pay with that and lose your property rights to pay for the government fed-run brainwashing centers.
[00:40:56.182 --> 00:41:00.004]  The public indoctrination prison centers.
[00:41:00.004 --> 00:41:04.165]  The churches, until the 50s, weren't 501c3 charities.
[00:41:04.165 --> 00:41:05.886]  They knew they were under the First Amendment.
[00:41:05.886 --> 00:41:11.188]  Congress shall make no law respecting an established religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:41:11.188 --> 00:41:15.050]  Government has no jurisdiction in it until they trick you to sign into the jurisdiction.
[00:41:16.383 --> 00:41:18.724]  And now you go to pretty much any church there is.
[00:41:18.724 --> 00:41:21.206]  Go to the Methodist Church.
[00:41:21.206 --> 00:41:22.287]  First Methodist of Austin.
[00:41:22.287 --> 00:41:24.028]  Bill and Melinda Gates are going to save you.
[00:41:24.028 --> 00:41:25.869]  Open the borders.
[00:41:25.869 --> 00:41:27.270]  Heather has two mommies.
[00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:28.370]  Go to a Baptist church.
[00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:29.491]  Worship the police state.
[00:41:29.491 --> 00:41:31.953]  Do whatever government tells you.
[00:41:31.953 --> 00:41:34.494]  I've read the stuff that's at Catholic churches online.
[00:41:34.494 --> 00:41:36.596]  Turn your firearms in there of the devil.
[00:41:36.596 --> 00:41:37.776]  Open the borders up.
[00:41:37.776 --> 00:41:39.297]  It's illegal to have borders.
[00:41:39.297 --> 00:41:40.258]  World government's good.
[00:41:43.561 --> 00:41:48.183]  These are government spokesmen, even though they may love God and not be evil people.
[00:41:48.183 --> 00:41:54.225]  They're gullible chumps who think Romans 13, Hitler's favorite passage, is their world.
[00:41:54.225 --> 00:42:00.968]  And you should get it at Infowars.com, Pastor Chuck Baldwin's excellent book, Romans 13, written with his son, who's a constitutional lawyer.
[00:42:03.174 --> 00:42:05.836]  And get it out to every one of these preachers and rebuke them.
[00:42:05.836 --> 00:42:08.579]  I mean, that's why my wife always wants me to go to church.
[00:42:08.579 --> 00:42:15.585]  If I'd have gone to church with her and heard that Baptist preacher go into this government worship, I'd have had to stand up right there.
[00:42:15.585 --> 00:42:18.007]  I mean, I cannot be around it.
[00:42:18.007 --> 00:42:21.750]  And maybe that is my calling every Sunday, to go into church and stand up.
[00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:23.772]  Notice that's why they always got the big bouncer.
[00:42:23.772 --> 00:42:25.853]  They call him an usher.
[00:42:25.853 --> 00:42:28.636]  It's all so devilish, I tell you.
[00:42:28.636 --> 00:42:29.717]  These people have no idea.
[00:42:35.558 --> 00:42:37.520]  Let me explain something to you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:41.964]  I know you know this, but we've got to get this information out to everybody.
[00:42:41.964 --> 00:42:43.705]  I'm going to shoot a special report.
[00:42:43.705 --> 00:42:45.207]  It'll be on the Nightly News tonight.
[00:42:45.207 --> 00:42:49.391]  I want everybody to get it and get it out to everybody, because we've got to call talk radio.
[00:42:49.391 --> 00:42:51.072]  We've got to call the newspapers.
[00:42:51.072 --> 00:42:52.513]  We've got to write letters to the editor.
[00:42:52.513 --> 00:42:53.875]  We've got to call Congress now.
[00:42:55.325 --> 00:42:56.967]  Because this is incredible.
[00:42:56.967 --> 00:43:02.493]  Congress passed the NDAA saying the President can secretly arrest and disappear citizens.
[00:43:02.493 --> 00:43:11.862]  They've got other legislation pending that says for any reason they can strip your citizenship, if the President or Defense Department says, and deport you.
[00:43:13.135 --> 00:43:15.016]  As a natural-born citizen.
[00:43:15.016 --> 00:43:20.678]  See, nobody, even kangaroo court Nazi courts, didn't say you weren't a German.
[00:43:20.678 --> 00:43:22.358]  They would just trump something up.
[00:43:22.358 --> 00:43:26.780]  This is saying you just disappear.
[00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:28.520]  Of course, it led to that later in Germany.
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:30.641]  But at first, they would have show trials.
[00:43:31.974 --> 00:43:38.237]  Everywhere they want to just suspend due process and say you're guilty until we bury you six feet under.
[00:43:38.237 --> 00:43:40.638]  It's not guilty until proven innocent.
[00:43:40.638 --> 00:43:42.679]  It's supposed to be innocent until proven guilty.
[00:43:42.679 --> 00:43:44.380]  Then it's guilty until proven innocent.
[00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:49.742]  And now it's you're guilty, period, government's God, and we're buying giant armored tanks.
[00:43:49.742 --> 00:43:52.163]  Folks, search was up over the weekend.
[00:43:52.163 --> 00:43:55.044]  Homeland Security buys giant armored vehicles.
[00:43:55.044 --> 00:43:58.366]  And these things look like something out of the Running Man.
[00:43:58.726 --> 00:44:02.589]  I mean, these are armored vehicles that look like the tanks the Nazis built.
[00:44:02.589 --> 00:44:06.573]  I mean, they've got wheels that are like, you know, ten feet tall.
[00:44:06.573 --> 00:44:09.375]  And they've got like foot-thick armor for the American people.
[00:44:09.375 --> 00:44:16.301]  They're buying hundreds of millions of rounds a month, digging in armored pillboxes that they drag behind these things.
[00:44:16.301 --> 00:44:18.182]  And again, it's not the government.
[00:44:18.182 --> 00:44:20.104]  It's foreign banks took over.
[00:44:23.237 --> 00:44:27.188]  Now there's Paul Watson's article about Homeland Security buying up ammo supplies.
[00:44:27.188 --> 00:44:30.899]  Type in, Homeland Security buys giant armored vehicles.
[00:44:31.969 --> 00:44:33.330]  And tanks.
[00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:38.894]  This new one I saw Friday that Nemo posted was just absolutely gorgantuan.
[00:44:38.894 --> 00:44:40.976]  And then I looked up, they're buying hundreds of them.
[00:44:40.976 --> 00:44:45.520]  I've talked to the troops at the bases and confirmed and then checked and it's true.
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:53.506]  They're taking warrior fighting vehicles, Bradleys and others and deploying them in strategic locations all over the country.
[00:44:53.506 --> 00:44:59.410]  In fact, most counties now have regular army caches, not at the regular armory,
[00:45:00.311 --> 00:45:02.433]  But they've got caches at facilities.
[00:45:02.433 --> 00:45:05.335]  I wasn't worried about citizens running to those.
[00:45:05.335 --> 00:45:10.619]  They've got hidden caches of tanks, armored vehicles, flamethrowers, rocket launchers.
[00:45:10.619 --> 00:45:11.279]  There it is.
[00:45:11.279 --> 00:45:14.962]  Homeland Security unveils monstrous SWAT trucks.
[00:45:14.962 --> 00:45:17.103]  Look at this thing.
[00:45:17.103 --> 00:45:19.005]  That's bigger than the ones they've got in Iraq.
[00:45:19.005 --> 00:45:23.288]  The troops can't have those.
[00:45:23.288 --> 00:45:25.049]  Alright, and that's not even a big one.
[00:45:25.049 --> 00:45:26.410]  I found one in there that was even bigger.
[00:45:26.410 --> 00:45:27.271]  It had even bigger wheels.
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:39.604]  It's the oldest story in human history where governments get taken over by criminals, they know the public's waking up, so they arm to the teeth and declare anybody who doesn't want to be a slave the enemy.
[00:45:39.604 --> 00:45:41.165]  I'm going to explain something.
[00:45:41.165 --> 00:45:48.788]  The public Agenda 21 plan is they're going to keep raising, even when housing prices went down where I live, they raised property taxes.
[00:45:48.788 --> 00:45:56.612]  They're going to bankrupt everybody who isn't on the inside track, just like all the other coal plants have to shut down, except those owned by globalists.
[00:45:59.996 --> 00:46:02.998]  And Congress says don't do it, and Obama says I'm gonna do it.
[00:46:02.998 --> 00:46:07.082]  Don't launch a war in Libya, I got you in authority.
[00:46:07.082 --> 00:46:13.667]  You get to a point in tyranny where they're not eating around the edges anymore.
[00:46:13.667 --> 00:46:19.953]  But where they do whatever they want, whenever they want.
[00:46:19.953 --> 00:46:22.135]  And they train you to be a complete prisoner.
[00:46:23.342 --> 00:46:34.170]  The preacher, where my wife went to church, said the way to do it is if you get pulled over, be thankful and put your keys on the dash and your hands up.
[00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:35.551]  I mean, literal prisoner training.
[00:46:35.551 --> 00:46:37.172]  That's what the DSA is.
[00:46:37.172 --> 00:46:39.494]  As if we're all criminals.
[00:46:39.494 --> 00:46:43.196]  And I always do that and the officers thank me.
[00:46:43.196 --> 00:46:45.078]  Why don't you just put your hands out the window?
[00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:50.871]  And that's what our kids are trained for in the schools, being put on the school buses and taken to FEMA centers.
[00:46:50.871 --> 00:46:53.172]  And some cops listening go, well, that does make it safer.
[00:46:53.172 --> 00:46:54.972]  The point is, crooks run you.
[00:46:54.972 --> 00:46:57.653]  You may be the nicest guy in the world.
[00:46:57.653 --> 00:46:59.374]  Might be fun to go deer hunting with you.
[00:46:59.374 --> 00:47:00.974]  I bet it would be.
[00:47:00.974 --> 00:47:05.355]  I bet you'd be fun to sit around a table, drink beer, and eat a T-bone steak.
[00:47:05.355 --> 00:47:10.617]  But the point is, the government isn't the government anymore, okay?
[00:47:10.617 --> 00:47:15.038]  Now, I want to go to this clip, and we're going to come back with the IRS news, but domestic checkpoints.
[00:47:16.445 --> 00:47:33.064]  When the IRS, who has its own fake courts, and who takes homes, houses, without courts, and who garnishes wages without courts, and who just says what you owe them, and it's all written Byzantine, so the elites are exempt, it's written like that on purpose.
[00:47:35.156 --> 00:47:45.144]  They say if you owe taxes, you're not going to be able to travel outside the country and they're going to revoke, that is, turn off the chip in your passport.
[00:47:45.144 --> 00:47:47.887]  I told you every week
[00:47:49.161 --> 00:47:54.843]  For over a decade, that was the plan, because I would read the white papers coming out of MIT.
[00:47:54.843 --> 00:48:03.066]  They admit the system they set up in Baghdad and Fallujah is modeled after the, quote, control grid, cashless society control grid.
[00:48:03.066 --> 00:48:04.186]  That's not my term.
[00:48:04.186 --> 00:48:09.728]  That's RAND Corporation, Department of Defense, MIT.
[00:48:09.728 --> 00:48:14.109]  The Matrix isn't a term written by some author for the Wachowski brothers.
[00:48:14.109 --> 00:48:15.150]  That's a 1970s Pentagon plan.
[00:48:16.963 --> 00:48:17.643]  Doesn't mean that ever.
[00:48:17.643 --> 00:48:20.885]  I mean, it's so crazy.
[00:48:20.885 --> 00:48:25.968]  Reality is so much wilder than any science fiction movie.
[00:48:25.968 --> 00:48:27.830]  People tell me they're bored.
[00:48:27.830 --> 00:48:33.633]  You're living in an artificial environment, basically, now in these cities, with everything being manipulated.
[00:48:33.633 --> 00:48:37.956]  Electromagnetic, chemical, biological, all of it, on record.
[00:48:37.956 --> 00:48:40.837]  The elites all have their private food supply, non-GMO.
[00:48:40.837 --> 00:48:41.938]  They don't take the vaccines.
[00:48:41.938 --> 00:48:43.519]  I'm going to go to break and come back with this.
[00:48:43.519 --> 00:48:45.060]  But here's Rahm Emanuel.
[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:46.401]  This is what this new domestic
[00:48:47.625 --> 00:48:53.669]  Homeland Security, National ID, Domestic Checkpoint, Capital Control System-ish.
[00:48:53.669 --> 00:48:55.950]  Is just, you don't own a gun because we say.
[00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:56.810]  No judge, no jury.
[00:48:56.810 --> 00:48:58.151]  You don't fly because we say.
[00:48:58.151 --> 00:49:00.413]  You don't leave the country because we say.
[00:49:00.413 --> 00:49:01.553]  You don't have a job.
[00:49:01.553 --> 00:49:03.634]  TSA is going to be over all hiring.
[00:49:03.634 --> 00:49:06.616]  They're going to be in all neighborhoods.
[00:49:06.616 --> 00:49:09.258]  Folks, every dentist my dad has now talked to.
[00:49:10.305 --> 00:49:13.326]  He thought it was just him, so he asked other dentists and called other offices.
[00:49:13.326 --> 00:49:21.329]  They're all being approached by spies, it turns out, who were long-term patients.
[00:49:21.329 --> 00:49:28.271]  And, of course, I can't even say the guy's name, because it's, it's, it's, it's a, he wouldn't even tell me, because it's, you know, it's a doctor-client privilege.
[00:49:28.271 --> 00:49:31.312]  Of course, the government, the doctors are told, though, go ahead and tell us stuff.
[00:49:31.312 --> 00:49:33.733]  And he was approached, and this guy was so dumb, he didn't even know that
[00:49:35.472 --> 00:49:40.533]  You know, my dad was the father of Alex Jones, even though he'd been going to them for 10 years or more.
[00:49:40.533 --> 00:49:44.174]  And my dad had treated his mother.
[00:49:44.174 --> 00:49:50.356]  And he tried to recruit my dad to spy on his patients and to be a Homeland Security secret agent.
[00:49:50.356 --> 00:49:51.776]  Pay card!
[00:49:51.776 --> 00:49:54.097]  And my dad called me and goes, are they trying to set me up?
[00:49:54.097 --> 00:49:55.998]  And I said, no, ask the other dentist.
[00:49:55.998 --> 00:50:00.019]  They're like, yeah, we got approached, but we're not supposed to talk about it.
[00:50:00.019 --> 00:50:04.580]  Some of them at their houses, folks, they got, they're going around getting an army of evil ready for us.
[00:50:05.219 --> 00:50:07.000]  This is the takedown of America!
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.581]  These are the foreign spies!
[00:50:08.581 --> 00:50:09.442]  These are the agents!
[00:50:09.442 --> 00:50:11.403]  We've been infiltrated!
[00:50:11.403 --> 00:50:13.284]  It's the New World Order!
[00:50:13.284 --> 00:50:16.646]  I've got the BBC saying Goldman Sachs conquered Europe!
[00:50:16.646 --> 00:50:18.147]  Put all it's people in!
[00:50:18.147 --> 00:50:19.768]  Over the National Police!
[00:50:19.768 --> 00:50:21.389]  Over the Finance Ministers!
[00:50:21.389 --> 00:50:22.329]  I'm getting chills!
[00:50:22.329 --> 00:50:22.989]  The Presidents!
[00:50:22.989 --> 00:50:24.190]  The Prime Ministers!
[00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:26.532]  Latin America they run almost all the countries!
[00:50:26.532 --> 00:50:26.812]  Asia!
[00:50:27.984 --> 00:50:28.985]  And it's standardized.
[00:50:28.985 --> 00:50:38.915]  Black tanks, black armor, black uniforms, checkpoints, can't leave the country, citizen spies, block captains, preachers telling you to spy on each other.
[00:50:40.779 --> 00:50:47.447]  And they go to these preachers and these dentists, and they get on these power trips, and here's a Homeland Security guy going, come to this meeting.
[00:50:47.447 --> 00:50:49.670]  And he was showing him the badge and everything.
[00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:53.374]  And I got money, and you're going to get paid, and you're going to spy on everybody.
[00:50:53.374 --> 00:50:54.736]  And my dad's like, spy on what?
[00:50:54.736 --> 00:50:55.997]  Everything.
[00:50:55.997 --> 00:50:57.679]  Something big's about to happen.
[00:50:57.679 --> 00:50:58.801]  And my dad's just looking at him.
[00:51:00.862 --> 00:51:04.663]  Right now, the average family spends one-fourth of their income on food.

[00:53:55.290 --> 00:53:56.631]  The choice is clear.
[00:53:56.631 --> 00:54:00.855]  Be unprepared or beprepared.com.
[00:54:00.855 --> 00:54:01.916]  Federal agents!
[00:54:01.916 --> 00:54:05.038]  We are armed!
[00:54:05.038 --> 00:54:08.121]  They're not federal agents.
[00:54:08.121 --> 00:54:21.492]  They work for the private banks that have taken over this country and brag in hundreds of publications like The Economist that it is a dictatorship of quote, technocratic central bankers.
[00:54:22.253 --> 00:54:38.217]  Remember all those years I said central bankers imploding the economy through derivatives, world government, then they're going to have capital controls, checkpoints, to buy and sell, face scanning, it'll be a digital photo, all of it now being announced.
[00:54:38.217 --> 00:54:39.757]  And you're like, okay, well I'll just put up with that.
[00:54:39.757 --> 00:54:40.317]  No, no, no.
[00:54:40.317 --> 00:54:50.120]  It's meant to manage the economy, track it all, shut down the grassroots, farmers markets, you name it, that they call black market, because they know as they squeeze you, you're going to try to survive.
[00:54:51.019 --> 00:54:54.962]  And this is about no more single-parent homes, not having money to have kids.
[00:54:54.962 --> 00:54:55.883]  They now say that.
[00:54:55.883 --> 00:55:00.747]  We're going to bankrupt you so you can't have kids, and if you do and you're poor, we're going to take them.
[00:55:00.747 --> 00:55:02.529]  This is the planned economy.
[00:55:02.529 --> 00:55:04.470]  This is Agenda 21.
[00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:06.512]  This is it!
[00:55:06.512 --> 00:55:07.873]  Do you understand?
[00:55:07.873 --> 00:55:09.574]  It's worse than I'm saying.
[00:55:09.574 --> 00:55:11.096]  People go, oh, it can't be that bad.
[00:55:11.096 --> 00:55:12.497]  It's worse.
[00:55:12.497 --> 00:55:13.718]  It's worse.
[00:55:13.718 --> 00:55:17.621]  It's all going to happen unless we really get upset.
[00:55:19.758 --> 00:55:36.629]  And again, what got me upset is this Forbes article and the Fox articles is all like, oh well, yeah, it's gonna pass, and self-fulfilling prophecy, and you know, again, the IRS just puts you on a list and just says you're in arrears.
[00:55:36.629 --> 00:55:41.072]  I get letters all the time saying I am, and I always start fighting it, and it turns out it's made up.
[00:55:41.072 --> 00:55:42.953]  Again, the whole thing's a fraud to begin with.
[00:55:42.953 --> 00:55:46.416]  It's a collection agency for the private federal reserve.
[00:55:46.416 --> 00:55:47.997]  This is the type of stuff we're talking about.
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:56:03.728]  Now, this is the model where gangster crooks like Rahm Emanuel, who gives, you know, billions of dollars to fake energy companies, and Don Corzine, who steals billions of his own people's money, lies to Congress, doesn't get in trouble.
[00:56:03.728 --> 00:56:05.429]  That's where your tax money goes.
[00:56:05.429 --> 00:56:10.712]  Most of your tax money doesn't even go to defense or police or any of it.
[00:56:10.712 --> 00:56:12.613]  It goes to the bankers.
[00:56:13.615 --> 00:56:16.956]  That's why Warren Buffett's like, raise taxes on the rich, because he's exempt.
[00:56:16.956 --> 00:56:21.018]  He wants the middle class and new wealth, nouveau riche's money.
[00:56:21.018 --> 00:56:22.578]  It's so elementary.
[00:56:22.578 --> 00:56:28.921]  And that talking point needs to get out everywhere, because it's the truth.
[00:56:28.921 --> 00:56:30.941]  It's the truth.
[00:56:30.941 --> 00:56:32.242]  Let's go to Rahm Emanuel.
[00:56:34.141 --> 00:56:38.228]  To the Brady Center about how they're just going to put you on a list.
[00:56:38.228 --> 00:56:44.418]  They say if you're on a no-fly list, 2 million people don't know why they're on it, can't get off of it.
[00:56:44.418 --> 00:56:46.862]  Last time I checked, like 30-something Congress people are on them.
[00:56:48.430 --> 00:56:51.573]  Little five-year-old kids, six-year-old kids are on them.
[00:56:51.573 --> 00:56:56.959]  If you're on that list, and maybe a possible terrorist, no judge, no jury, you don't have access to a firearm.
[00:56:56.959 --> 00:56:59.482]  They're just going to expand that list, folks.
[00:56:59.482 --> 00:57:02.625]  Already, most veterans I talk to can't buy guns, even though they have no criminal record.
[00:57:02.625 --> 00:57:04.227]  You're just put on the list now.
[00:57:04.227 --> 00:57:05.929]  It's already in place.
[00:57:05.929 --> 00:57:09.333]  Just like the ATF's now telling gun shops what they can do outside of law.
[00:57:09.833 --> 00:57:12.454]  That's called capital T tyranny.
[00:57:12.454 --> 00:57:15.776]  And now these same crooks are going to have a no-fly list.
[00:57:15.776 --> 00:57:24.340]  And the IRS has said their ultimate plan is you're not going to be able to have a car, insurance, have a job, or travel anywhere if you're in bad steads with them.
[00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:29.223]  You're going to be on the no-fly list and the no-gun-by list, and then you're going to have to turn your guns in.
[00:57:29.223 --> 00:57:31.424]  That's the plan you watch.
[00:57:31.424 --> 00:57:33.045]  Here's Rahm Emanuel.
[00:57:33.045 --> 00:57:39.288]  And I think the most simple thing we can do, and we've got to make this a number one issue as a test vote and then take it into the election.
[00:57:40.191 --> 00:57:49.412]  That is, if you are on the no-fly list, because you are known as maybe a possible terrorist, you cannot buy a handgun in America.
[00:57:54.838 --> 00:57:56.719]  Listen to those criminals clapping.
[00:57:56.719 --> 00:57:57.339]  Those are tyrants.
[00:57:57.339 --> 00:58:06.124]  I am not one far from liking the mixing of politics and policy, but as my old boss used to say, give me that vote and throw me into that prior patch.
[00:58:06.124 --> 00:58:11.968]  I'll make politics out of that every day, because if it's between that terrorist list and the NRA,
[00:58:13.248 --> 00:58:18.871]  I know where America's gonna be every time, and they're gonna make the right choice, and we have got to start building on that.
[00:58:18.871 --> 00:58:22.252]  That is the right thing to take into the election, and it's the right policy.
[00:58:22.252 --> 00:58:29.536]  If you're on that no-fly list, your access to the right to bear arms is cancelled, because you're not part of the American family.
[00:58:29.536 --> 00:58:30.576]  You don't deserve that right.
[00:58:30.576 --> 00:58:31.016]  That's enough.
[00:58:31.016 --> 00:58:34.718]  You don't deserve that right, which is a privilege now, they're saying, to travel.
[00:58:34.718 --> 00:58:36.819]  This is for everybody.
[00:58:36.819 --> 00:58:39.040]  We're all terrorists, according to that terrorist.
[00:58:43.616 --> 00:58:51.199]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.199 --> 00:58:57.841]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:58:57.841 --> 00:59:02.983]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:59:02.983 --> 00:59:08.786]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:59:11.701 --> 00:59:18.227]  They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[00:59:20.206 --> 00:59:24.789]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:59:24.789 --> 00:59:28.632]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[00:59:28.632 --> 00:59:29.853]  Others don't.
[00:59:29.853 --> 00:59:32.014]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:59:32.014 --> 00:59:33.796]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:59:33.796 --> 00:59:36.678]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:59:36.678 --> 00:59:43.302]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:59:43.302 --> 00:59:46.004]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:59:46.004 --> 00:59:48.386]  Diamond Gusset Jeans, got it.
[00:59:48.386 --> 00:59:49.207]  Others don't.
[00:59:53.658 --> 00:59:56.039]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.039 --> 01:00:05.442]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.442 --> 01:00:06.743]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.743 --> 01:00:08.523]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.523 --> 01:00:10.264]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.264 --> 01:00:11.864]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.864 --> 01:00:13.785]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.785 --> 01:00:17.586]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.586 --> 01:00:21.668]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.249 --> 01:00:28.790]  Patriotism in America is about groveling to tyranny and worshipping the government.
[01:00:28.790 --> 01:00:33.111]  That's what the American flag symbolizes now, they've taken it.
[01:00:33.111 --> 01:00:44.533]  And until we admit we have a foreign corporate government that's occupying our nation and butchering our Bill of Rights systematically, we have no hope of turning things around.
[01:00:44.533 --> 01:00:50.654]  And if people think Mitt Romney's gonna save them, that the globalists are lining up, he's financed by the very same people.
[01:00:50.654 --> 01:00:50.814]  Now,
[01:00:51.943 --> 01:00:54.085]  I call Rahm Emanuel a terrorist, he really is.
[01:00:54.085 --> 01:01:03.472]  His parents were the head of, his father was the head of the Irgun, the top Israeli terrorist that bombed Palestine and surrounding areas until they kicked the British out.
[01:01:03.472 --> 01:01:09.077]  His dad bombed British troops, blew up King David Hotel, you name it.
[01:01:10.563 --> 01:01:12.063]  So he is kind of like a rock star.
[01:01:12.063 --> 01:01:14.664]  That's like wow to terrorists worldwide.
[01:01:14.664 --> 01:01:15.304]  He's a rock star.
[01:01:15.304 --> 01:01:17.864]  And he's a mafia don as well.
[01:01:17.864 --> 01:01:20.465]  But he's the guy that says he wants national service.
[01:01:20.465 --> 01:01:23.225]  And he wants you with a machine gun on a street corner.
[01:01:23.225 --> 01:01:28.206]  You know, the kids shoving mama and papa around and granddaddy around.
[01:01:28.206 --> 01:01:32.367]  I mean, if you go through any tyranny of the past, Rahm Emanuel's promoting it.
[01:01:32.367 --> 01:01:33.767]  You name it, he's into it.
[01:01:33.767 --> 01:01:37.488]  From black uniforms to national compulsory service to checkpoints.
[01:01:38.584 --> 01:01:50.147]  And the criminal IRS for the Federal Reserve setting up checkpoints nationwide, not letting you fly out of the country and taking your passport, which is taking your citizenship.
[01:01:50.147 --> 01:01:55.328]  A citizen's right is to travel and to leave to and from the country.
[01:01:55.328 --> 01:01:58.988]  And it's passed the Senate and they say it's probably going to pass the House.
[01:01:58.988 --> 01:02:01.349]  And the media is like, oh yeah, it's no big deal.
[01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:05.410]  Yeah, there's a lot of stuff you can't buy and sell and do if you haven't paid child support or
[01:02:06.518 --> 01:02:10.139]  If you've got outstanding taxes now, you can't get a hunting license.
[01:02:10.139 --> 01:02:11.199]  It's all through a database.
[01:02:11.199 --> 01:02:14.160]  Now you won't be able to leave the country or travel or soon have a job.
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:20.861]  And Homeland Security is already approving most job applications for different corporations.
[01:02:20.861 --> 01:02:21.761]  Because they're the good guys.
[01:02:21.761 --> 01:02:29.543]  You know, they're the ones that ship the drugs into the United States and the guns into Mexico and Honduras.
[01:02:29.543 --> 01:02:30.783]  No, they're just a mafia.
[01:02:30.783 --> 01:02:32.763]  They're just a bunch of crooks.
[01:02:32.763 --> 01:02:34.084]  That's all they are.
[01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:34.844]  A bunch of crooks.
[01:02:34.844 --> 01:02:35.404]  Let's go back
[01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:41.503]  To him, sitting there saying, this is the guy that says we'll secretly arrest you and disappear you.
[01:02:41.503 --> 01:02:42.824]  We'll torture you.
[01:02:42.824 --> 01:02:44.505]  You won't get a gun if we say so.
[01:02:44.505 --> 01:02:45.566]  No judge, no jury.
[01:02:45.566 --> 01:02:49.729]  Because I say so!
[01:02:49.729 --> 01:02:54.672]  Again, another guy who's openly served in foreign military.
[01:02:54.672 --> 01:02:56.113]  You know, he served in the Israeli military.
[01:02:56.113 --> 01:02:58.615]  And I'm not even an enemy of Israel.
[01:02:58.615 --> 01:03:00.897]  My point is, this guy is a terrorist.
[01:03:00.897 --> 01:03:03.478]  This guy is a usurper.
[01:03:03.478 --> 01:03:04.319]  It's just that simple.
[01:03:06.585 --> 01:03:18.634]  There it is, you have a foreigner saying, arrest Americans, secretly arrest them, conscript their children, and don't let them fly if they hadn't paid the private Federal Reserve through the IRS.
[01:03:18.634 --> 01:03:19.995]  I mean, it's that simple.
[01:03:19.995 --> 01:03:25.339]  Our country has been taken over by outside elements, by the globalists, by all these special interests.
[01:03:25.339 --> 01:03:27.501]  We're a joke!
[01:03:27.501 --> 01:03:30.663]  And they've got the propaganda, they've got the police, they've got the military.
[01:03:30.663 --> 01:03:32.905]  And they're getting ready to stage terror attacks, you better believe it.
[01:03:33.851 --> 01:03:37.834]  Let's go ahead and go back to this terrorist in chief Rahm Emanuel.
[01:03:37.834 --> 01:03:40.616]  You are known as maybe a possible terrorist.
[01:03:40.616 --> 01:03:43.978]  You cannot buy a handgun in America.
[01:03:46.943 --> 01:03:49.384]  No judge, no jury, no fly list.
[01:03:49.384 --> 01:03:51.004]  Look at him smirking.
[01:03:51.004 --> 01:03:52.025]  Just drips criminality.
[01:03:52.025 --> 01:04:00.147]  I'm not one far from liking the mixing of politics and policy, but if my old boss used to say... If you saw him in a dark alley, he would turn away.
[01:04:00.147 --> 01:04:01.847]  He looks like a serial killer, doesn't he?
[01:04:01.847 --> 01:04:03.668]  It's not just how people look, but he's a demon.
[01:04:07.822 --> 01:04:10.963]  I know where America's going to be every time, and they're going to make the right choice.
[01:04:10.963 --> 01:04:13.444]  We have got to start building on that.
[01:04:13.444 --> 01:04:16.845]  That is the right thing to take into the election, and it's the right policy.
[01:04:16.845 --> 01:04:23.808]  If you're on that no-fly list, your access to the right to bear arms is cancelled, because you're not part of the American family.
[01:04:23.988 --> 01:04:25.809]  You're not part of the American family.
[01:04:25.809 --> 01:04:26.549]  There is no right.
[01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:29.090]  You're a terrorist who wants to destroy our Bill of Rights.
[01:04:29.090 --> 01:04:31.311]  That should be number one in what we do.
[01:04:31.311 --> 01:04:34.073]  Make sure there's a full force of the law behind the Brady Bill.
[01:04:34.073 --> 01:04:39.715]  So to all those who dedicate their lives to seeing sensible gun laws... Uh-huh, that's enough, Ann.
[01:04:39.715 --> 01:04:44.678]  It's sensible that, you know, no judge, no jury, no crime, just you can't buy a gun and we're not gonna tell you why.
[01:04:45.718 --> 01:04:55.568]  The terror no-fly list is the no-buy list, the no-buy-and-sell list, the go-to-the-FEMA-camp-concentration-camp list that they now admit they're building.
[01:04:55.568 --> 01:04:56.169]  Okay?
[01:04:56.169 --> 01:04:57.811]  Get out of my country, you foreign terrorists!
[01:05:01.809 --> 01:05:03.510]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:08.813]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:05:08.813 --> 01:05:10.354]  Saving means to make money.

[01:05:19.879 --> 01:05:27.426]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:05:27.426 --> 01:05:35.434]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.

[01:07:00.236 --> 01:07:04.799]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:04.799 --> 01:07:05.699]  Number one.
[01:07:05.699 --> 01:07:09.121]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:09.121 --> 01:07:10.002]  Number two.
[01:07:10.002 --> 01:07:14.884]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:14.884 --> 01:07:15.625]  It's true.
[01:07:15.625 --> 01:07:20.507]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:20.507 --> 01:07:21.328]  Number three.
[01:07:21.328 --> 01:07:24.910]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:28.612]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:28.812 --> 01:07:29.613]  Number 4.
[01:07:29.613 --> 01:07:32.375]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:32.375 --> 01:07:36.058]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:36.058 --> 01:07:36.839]  Number 5.
[01:07:36.839 --> 01:07:41.003]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:41.003 --> 01:07:45.747]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:46.027 --> 01:07:50.212]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:50.212 --> 01:07:51.994]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:51.994 --> 01:07:54.256]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:07:54.256 --> 01:07:56.879]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:07:56.879 --> 01:08:03.987]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.987 --> 01:08:06.770]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.915 --> 01:08:26.440]  Now, for the rest of the hour, and perhaps a little bit into the next, to take phone calls, is best-selling author James Wesley Rawls.
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:43.310]  He's written fiction, non-fiction, he's got a lot of amazing insights into things, and of course he was also put in Army Intelligence, held a top-secret security clearance with a special background investigation, acts assistive, compartmentalized information.
[01:08:43.310 --> 01:08:44.151]  He was awarded Officer
[01:08:45.532 --> 01:08:48.573]  Specialty 35A, Tactical All Source Intelligence Officer.
[01:08:48.573 --> 01:08:51.734]  I'll go through all of his interesting bio here.
[01:08:51.734 --> 01:08:59.255]  He was a Captain in Army Intelligence, just to give you the short end of it.
[01:08:59.255 --> 01:09:09.998]  He'll be with us to talk about preparation for the engineered collapse that the Jena 21 Globalists have been carrying out.
[01:09:09.998 --> 01:09:13.059]  But you know that for the last hour plus, I have been
[01:09:14.426 --> 01:09:23.633]  Beside myself with the fact that capital controls are being implemented on the U.S.
[01:09:23.633 --> 01:09:32.399]  and I was told now three years ago that John Wayne's family was leaving the country.
[01:09:34.983 --> 01:09:36.904]  Bye, John Waynes.
[01:09:36.904 --> 01:09:39.025]  I'm going to just leave it at that.
[01:09:39.025 --> 01:09:48.690]  And by countless other wealthy people, powerful people, I talked to a lady who's one of the biggest defense contractor owners in the world, worth billions.
[01:09:48.690 --> 01:09:51.172]  She left the country four years ago.
[01:09:51.172 --> 01:09:53.513]  I've told you about that over and over again.
[01:09:53.513 --> 01:10:00.857]  And they said, look, you won't be able to get anything out of the country if you don't leave in the next few years.
[01:10:02.338 --> 01:10:03.299]  And that's the word.
[01:10:03.299 --> 01:10:10.944]  That's why all the big money people, even the globalists themselves, have been getting their money out of the country and buying armored redoubts or digging in here in the country.
[01:10:10.944 --> 01:10:21.311]  And all these elitists are building, you know, these 5, 10, 20, some cases 30 million dollar armored subterranean homes with, you know, machine gun turrets.
[01:10:22.151 --> 01:10:23.172]  Why are they doing this?
[01:10:23.172 --> 01:10:35.601]  Because they've done a great job at carrying out this Agenda 21 resource war of de-industrializing the West, getting us into debt, signing us onto their derivatives, and getting ready to fully implode the country.
[01:10:35.601 --> 01:10:43.187]  And as we slide into depression, they keep telling us everything's fine, everything's fine, everything's wonderful, as the crime rate increases, as all of this happens.
[01:10:43.187 --> 01:10:47.871]  But the good news is, between 5 and 7 million, because it varies month to month,
[01:10:49.076 --> 01:10:54.317]  Previously, the record was like two million guns in a month, was the record month a few years ago.
[01:10:54.317 --> 01:10:58.618]  Now it's over five million guns a month.
[01:10:58.618 --> 01:11:05.340]  Many big manufacturers have announced they are suspending new orders for six months to a year.
[01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:09.461]  Small manufacturers are making the same announcement because they're so behind on orders.
[01:11:10.728 --> 01:11:20.173]  The government's buying giant armored vehicles, hundreds of millions of rounds a month, 400-something million this month, 300 million that month, 200 million this month, digging in.
[01:11:20.173 --> 01:11:28.717]  They've got the preachers and clergy response teams brainwashing their flocks, submit to government with what's coming, do what you're told, take the shots.
[01:11:28.717 --> 01:11:31.379]  Government's now shooting kids up without parental consent.
[01:11:32.319 --> 01:11:36.422]  Again, they're doing whatever they want, and they're announcing, we'll secretly arrest you if we want.
[01:11:36.422 --> 01:11:37.323]  We'll disappear you.
[01:11:37.323 --> 01:11:41.106]  You're not going to be able to fly out of the country if the IRS says you haven't paid.
[01:11:41.106 --> 01:11:42.187]  No judge, no jury.
[01:11:42.187 --> 01:11:44.489]  We're going to put you on a no-gun-by list.
[01:11:44.489 --> 01:11:46.170]  No judge, no jury, no crime.
[01:11:46.170 --> 01:11:57.559]  If you're on the no-fly list, and I've told you for over 10 years, because they were already talking about it even before 9-11, the no-fly list will be expanded to a no-work list, a no-buy-sell list with the digital photo.
[01:11:57.559 --> 01:11:59.020]  You'll still be able to use cash.
[01:12:00.109 --> 01:12:09.882]  But it'll be connected to a digital photo in all transactions and an internet ID on online purchases, and that's in the Cybersecurity Act they're trying to pass right now.
[01:12:10.876 --> 01:12:11.677]  CISPA.
[01:12:11.677 --> 01:12:14.939]  I mean, I'm getting chills every five seconds now, okay?
[01:12:14.939 --> 01:12:16.800]  Because I knew it was all coming.
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:35.012]  I read it from their own documents, but it is a total banker infiltration of the preachers, the police, the military, the media, the entire culture, and Forbes, and Fox, and I've even heard national hosts going, better pay those taxes, or you're not gonna be able to fly out of the country and go on that vacation.
[01:12:35.012 --> 01:12:37.793]  Folks, this is capital controls.
[01:12:37.793 --> 01:12:40.135]  This is right out of Nazi Germany, right out of Soviet Russia.
[01:12:41.465 --> 01:12:44.207]  I mean, this is one of the big hallmarks.
[01:12:44.207 --> 01:12:45.588]  Definition of capital control.
[01:12:45.588 --> 01:12:52.972]  Any measure taken by a government, central bank, or other regulatory body to limit the flow of foreign capital in and out of domestic economy.
[01:12:52.972 --> 01:12:54.734]  But this is even worse.
[01:12:54.734 --> 01:12:59.617]  They don't want a grassroots economy, so they're putting a capital control on that.
[01:12:59.617 --> 01:13:04.020]  That's why even Forbes said, why are they raiding thousands of lemonade stands?
[01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:05.861]  Why are they attacking peaceful protesters?
[01:13:05.861 --> 01:13:06.481]  Why?
[01:13:06.481 --> 01:13:07.122]  Why are they?
[01:13:07.122 --> 01:13:09.023]  Because it's here, folks.
[01:13:11.593 --> 01:13:19.380]  As well as market-based forces, capital controls can affect many asset classes such as equities, bonds, foreign exchange trades.
[01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:26.606]  Tight capital controls are often found in developing countries where the capital reserves are lower and more susceptible to volatility.
[01:13:26.606 --> 01:13:30.589]  It means when they're devaluing a currency is one of the big ones.
[01:13:35.816 --> 01:13:36.897]  That's from Investopedia.
[01:13:36.897 --> 01:13:38.618]  That's their definition of it.
[01:13:38.618 --> 01:13:39.679]  I have flown and seen it.
[01:13:39.679 --> 01:13:40.500]  It's been in the news.
[01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:41.480]  I did an interview with the guy.
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:44.963]  He had six silver coins, little ones.
[01:13:44.963 --> 01:13:46.244]  Computer programmer.
[01:13:46.244 --> 01:13:47.905]  And he was going to Vegas to a coin show.
[01:13:47.905 --> 01:13:49.887]  And they weren't even very valuable.
[01:13:49.887 --> 01:13:51.928]  He was just going to, you know, trade them and stuff.
[01:13:51.928 --> 01:13:52.389]  And I saw them.
[01:13:52.389 --> 01:13:53.470]  They were just U.S.
[01:13:53.470 --> 01:13:56.712]  silver rounds, you know, worth like $35 at the time.
[01:13:56.712 --> 01:13:58.473]  And they were going to take them.
[01:13:58.473 --> 01:13:59.975]  I saw them as I was going through Austin.
[01:14:01.434 --> 01:14:04.915]  They're now asking people about their diamond rings, their necklaces.
[01:14:04.915 --> 01:14:07.796]  They're downloading people's laptops.
[01:14:07.796 --> 01:14:09.457]  This is a prison induction.
[01:14:09.457 --> 01:14:10.357]  They're just getting you ready.
[01:14:10.357 --> 01:14:11.978]  Now I'm going to shut up and go to our guest.
[01:14:11.978 --> 01:14:15.279]  But I'm really freaked out about this because it's passed the Senate.
[01:14:15.279 --> 01:14:17.039]  It's now in the House.
[01:14:17.039 --> 01:14:22.101]  And the ATF, I was told this a month before the letter went out last year.
[01:14:22.101 --> 01:14:25.162]  I was the first to break the letter just pointing out that we have sources.
[01:14:25.162 --> 01:14:27.443]  The ATF is now going to tell people
[01:14:28.163 --> 01:14:30.305]  That you can't sell semi-autos anymore.
[01:14:30.305 --> 01:14:32.507]  That is, they're discussing it next year.
[01:14:32.507 --> 01:14:36.770]  The NRA says they've gotten word that, quote, there's big gun control next year if Obama gets elected.
[01:14:36.770 --> 01:14:45.998]  The point is that I was told that they were going to tell people, don't sell more than two guns to somebody in these four western states, Texas to California.
[01:14:45.998 --> 01:14:51.443]  And if you do, you've got to call the ATF, as if they don't already have a record of that through NICS.
[01:14:51.443 --> 01:14:55.647]  The point is, it's getting you used to doing what you're told, outside of law.
[01:14:57.315 --> 01:15:01.078]  Now, James, I didn't really tell you what I was going to get you on about today.
[01:15:01.078 --> 01:15:04.701]  I just wanted to pick your brain about current events and talk about, you know, your research.
[01:15:04.701 --> 01:15:08.664]  But being in Army Intelligence, seeing what's happening, I talked to military and police.
[01:15:08.664 --> 01:15:10.865]  A lot of them are finally waking up.
[01:15:10.865 --> 01:15:20.493]  But I see the system creating a cult of the military and the police, who they could care less about, taking their pension funds, you name it, to wear as a mantle around the tyranny
[01:15:21.661 --> 01:15:30.427]  Ahead of trying to start some new civil war in this country, they tried to start the race war with the Trayvon Martin thing, but people aren't buying that.
[01:15:30.427 --> 01:15:33.189]  NBC editing the tape, the White House pushing it.
[01:15:33.189 --> 01:15:35.211]  I mean, I can just see the volatility.
[01:15:35.211 --> 01:15:45.758]  I've just been ranting while you've been on hold about this IRS capital control and saying they're going to revoke your citizenship, basically, because that's what your passport is symbol of.
[01:15:45.758 --> 01:15:46.579]  It's a total right.
[01:15:48.159 --> 01:15:50.280]  I don't know of any culture that ever does that.
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:53.342]  On a case-by-case, for espionage, they take your passport.
[01:15:53.342 --> 01:15:54.663]  That's about it.
[01:15:54.663 --> 01:15:56.724]  Or when you're already out on bond.
[01:15:56.724 --> 01:15:59.286]  So they're saying, basically, you're all prisoners.
[01:15:59.286 --> 01:16:01.387]  And, of course, it'll be expanded.
[01:16:01.387 --> 01:16:06.131]  James Leslie Rawls, what do you make of this and all the other craziness, sir?
[01:16:06.131 --> 01:16:09.373]  Well, we're living in very dangerous times.
[01:16:09.373 --> 01:16:10.914]  And when I saw the
[01:16:11.917 --> 01:16:16.821]  The news reports about the IRS threatening to take people's passports.
[01:16:16.821 --> 01:16:28.671]  Actually what popped into my mind was Jonestown and Jim Jones taking away all of the people at the camp's passports and locking them up in a couple of foot lockers.
[01:16:28.671 --> 01:16:34.836]  We're verging on a society that's a police state at this point.
[01:16:34.836 --> 01:16:39.140]  And people need to wake up and they need to get themselves prepared
[01:16:40.345 --> 01:16:46.487]  If they're going to move overseas, they should take the gap soon.
[01:16:46.487 --> 01:16:57.829]  If they're going to hunker down here in the States, they need to get their Beans, Bullets, and Band-Aids squared away now, because those windows of opportunity are closing.
[01:16:57.829 --> 01:16:58.330]  I hear you.
[01:16:58.330 --> 01:16:59.790]  Are you getting chills?
[01:16:59.790 --> 01:17:04.971]  I mean, and by chills, I mean, ten years ago, I would feel the urgency a little bit.
[01:17:04.971 --> 01:17:07.612]  Now, it's blowing me away.
[01:17:08.752 --> 01:17:14.895]  Well, the immediacy of it, I think, is almost overwhelming at this point.
[01:17:14.895 --> 01:17:24.919]  When I first drafted my first novel, Patriots, back in 1990-1991, people looked at it as kind of wild speculation.
[01:17:24.919 --> 01:17:28.521]  But a lot of what was in there has come to pass.
[01:17:28.521 --> 01:17:31.502]  We're living in increasingly dangerous times.
[01:17:31.502 --> 01:17:35.964]  We're entering into an age of deception and betrayal by our own government.
[01:17:45.816 --> 01:17:47.097]  Very well said.
[01:17:47.097 --> 01:17:48.958]  I know you've got a lot of feelers out.
[01:17:48.958 --> 01:17:52.201]  Are you seeing people in the system starting to wake up like I am?
[01:17:52.201 --> 01:17:54.102]  Oh yes, absolutely.
[01:17:54.102 --> 01:18:01.028]  I have consulting clients right now that actually are mid-level and low-level employees.
[01:18:01.912 --> 01:18:02.152]  God.
[01:18:02.152 --> 01:18:02.732]  Oh God.
[01:18:02.732 --> 01:18:07.495]  You know what's so nasty is it's not just some boss hog that wants to rob everything.
[01:18:07.495 --> 01:18:08.576]  These globalists are really nasty.
[01:18:08.576 --> 01:18:09.877]  They want to hurt people.
[01:18:31.226 --> 01:18:39.592]  Well yeah, they've made it very clear that the whole concept of national sovereignty is essentially out the window.
[01:18:39.592 --> 01:18:55.142]  That you no longer have the freedom to travel, you no longer have any banking privacy, and if the internationalists have it, the globalists have it their way, they'll take away our right to keep and bear arms as well.
[01:18:55.142 --> 01:18:56.683]  As you've mentioned many times,
[01:18:57.344 --> 01:19:11.766]  There's a large push underway at the supranational level for the Small Arms and Light Weapons Treaty, which, if enacted, would essentially erase our Second Amendment.
[01:19:11.766 --> 01:19:18.048]  And they've said that treaties supersede the Constitution, which, of course, on record they don't, but they just lie and say that.
[01:19:18.048 --> 01:19:23.068]  Come on, they say the Second Amendment's a privilege, or traveling's a privilege.
[01:19:23.068 --> 01:19:26.429]  You know, Corzine stealing billions, getting caught lying and not getting in trouble.
[01:19:27.739 --> 01:19:36.923]  I mean, they really are just trying to break our will right now, and how do you fight back against this type of infiltration?
[01:19:36.923 --> 01:19:41.985]  How do you fight back against such a long-term, patient game now about to come to fruition?
[01:19:41.985 --> 01:19:55.631]  I know we preemptively exposed them decades ago, you did, and others did, and that gives us... They bought us some time, yes, but unfortunately we are approaching the endgame, and at this point
[01:19:57.212 --> 01:20:03.555]  While I do recommend that people remain politically active, at this point it's time to hunker down.
[01:20:03.555 --> 01:20:09.879]  It's time for individual families to team up with like-minded friends.
[01:20:09.879 --> 01:20:18.063]  Pick out a defendable piece of land with plentiful water and good topsoil and be ready to ride out the storm because it's coming.
[01:20:20.157 --> 01:20:21.178]  All right, you've got the floor.
[01:20:21.178 --> 01:20:31.585]  Breakdown, because again, I didn't read your novel until the mid-90s, late 90s, 96, 97, and it even had contemporary characters in it, like, you know, Mark Kornke and people.
[01:20:31.585 --> 01:20:32.746]  Totally blew me away.
[01:20:32.746 --> 01:20:37.990]  And, you know, what a collapse would look like, what an Agenda 21 would look like.
[01:20:37.990 --> 01:20:41.973]  You broke down, basically, and people said, well, why would they want to wreck it?
[01:20:41.973 --> 01:20:44.155]  Because they want to wreck it to try to consolidate it.
[01:20:44.935 --> 01:20:48.498]  And they risk overheating it too much and losing control.
[01:20:48.498 --> 01:20:49.018]  Right.
[01:20:49.018 --> 01:20:57.084]  But break down what you see happening, the scenarios you see unfolding, some of the different breaks there, how this could go in different directions.
[01:20:57.084 --> 01:21:03.769]  Well, I think in the near future, we're likely to see, as you've mentioned, a derivatives collapse.
[01:21:03.769 --> 01:21:06.551]  And the counterparty risk there is huge.
[01:21:06.551 --> 01:21:07.732]  It's almost incalculable.
[01:21:08.439 --> 01:21:13.645]  Because the number of derivatives that are in play measure in the hundreds of trillions of dollars.
[01:21:13.645 --> 01:21:18.129]  There's more derivatives in play than there is currency in the whole world.
[01:21:18.129 --> 01:21:26.699]  The economic risk is huge if we see a repeat of the 2008 credit collapse, which is quite likely.
[01:21:29.279 --> 01:21:31.481]  They were very well could be a banking collapse.
[01:21:31.481 --> 01:21:34.905]  There could be a stock market collapse, a collapse of the bond market.
[01:21:34.905 --> 01:21:37.267]  It could just be a house of cards coming down.
[01:21:37.267 --> 01:21:47.576]  There's a whole cascade of events that could bring our economy to its knees and bring commerce to a screeching halt.
[01:21:47.576 --> 01:21:53.281]  And as I've mentioned many times before, the crucial linchpin to watch is the power grid.
[01:21:53.281 --> 01:21:54.783]  If the power grid stays up,
[01:21:56.158 --> 01:22:12.143]  We may still have some semblance of order, but if the grid goes down, that will be the situation where the power brokers have basically lost control of their engineered collapse, and everyone's going to be in the same boat.
[01:22:12.143 --> 01:22:21.766]  We'll be in a massive die-off situation where literally more than half the population of the country could die over the course of one week.
[01:22:24.246 --> 01:22:31.071]  And by the way, the globalists have collapsed Argentina, and if that wasn't a warm area, they would have had, some say, millions of dead.
[01:22:31.071 --> 01:22:34.253]  I mean, it was doctors for years eating out of trash bins.
[01:22:34.253 --> 01:22:35.955]  It's still happening down there.
[01:22:35.955 --> 01:22:46.542]  And just to interject something, when you talk about the controlled collapse, why are they at the same time buying up and shutting down power plants to make bigger profits for the ones they control?
[01:22:48.208 --> 01:22:49.269]  and causing blackouts.
[01:22:49.269 --> 01:22:56.493]  It's like they can't even... the elite have a plan, but they're so greedy they're even destroying their own future.
[01:22:56.493 --> 01:22:57.934]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[01:22:57.934 --> 01:23:03.918]  Well, unfortunately, elitists have bought into the whole Green Revolution idea.
[01:23:03.918 --> 01:23:14.004]  But when you take the Green Revolution to its logical conclusion, you end up with people freezing in the dark because you cut off virtually every power source.
[01:23:14.004 --> 01:23:17.206]  And the few that are left, like solar and wind power,
[01:23:18.686 --> 01:23:23.868]  are unreliable in terms of providing 24-hour day grid power.
[01:23:23.868 --> 01:23:34.253]  If you get rid of all the coal-fired plants, all the hydro dams because they're killing little fishies, and get rid of all the natural gas-powered plants, all that leaves you with is solar and wind.
[01:23:34.253 --> 01:23:41.395]  And that's great when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing, but it gives you nothing when the conditions aren't right.
[01:23:41.395 --> 01:23:47.698]  So we're going to end up in a third-world situation where power is unreliable.
[01:23:48.864 --> 01:24:11.762]  And people need to be prepared to make their own power and get themselves in a situation where if there's disruption of grid power, for example, I recommend people buy propane-powered chest freezers rather than electric chest freezers because I think the power is going to be so unreliable.
[01:24:11.762 --> 01:24:15.845]  We may have power failures that go on for not days, but weeks.
[01:24:15.845 --> 01:24:17.767]  And if there's, of course, a total grid collapse,
[01:24:19.339 --> 01:24:21.721]  And the government's been saying, get ready for rolling blackouts.
[01:24:21.721 --> 01:24:22.963]  This is part of the new freedom.
[01:24:22.963 --> 01:24:29.889]  I just want to plug here that if people go to InfoWars.com, they can get Survivors by James Wesley Rawls.
[01:24:29.889 --> 01:24:30.449]  All the orders.
[01:24:30.449 --> 01:24:32.431]  Get a free citizen rulebook with it.
[01:24:32.431 --> 01:24:37.256]  Also, Strategic Relocation, North American Guide to Safe Places, third edition.
[01:24:37.256 --> 01:24:38.937]  Incredibly valuable information.
[01:24:38.937 --> 01:24:41.199]  Yeah, Joel Scouser's book is fantastic.
[01:24:41.199 --> 01:24:41.920]  I highly recommend it.
[01:24:42.847 --> 01:24:47.851]  People are definitely waking up and it's encouraging to see things like the Ron Paul campaign, for example.
[01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:29.789]  It's encouraging to see all of the free exchange of information that's going on on the internet and I think that's one reason why there's all this talk of clamping down on the internet is it has the Agenda 21 crowd running scared because when you shine a light on this it's like turning a light on in a
[01:25:31.269 --> 01:25:35.813]  Apartment and having the cockroaches go scurrying.
[01:25:35.813 --> 01:25:43.780]  We're in a situation now where there's such a fast exchange of information on the Internet that it's essentially unstoppable.
[01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:57.771]  And unless they're able to control access to the Internet and track people on the Internet and clamp down on darknets and people using VPN, for example,
[01:25:59.232 --> 01:26:00.593]  They basically can't.
[01:26:00.593 --> 01:26:01.653]  The genie is out of the bottle.
[01:26:01.653 --> 01:26:10.078]  They can't stop individual liberty unless they completely shut down the internet, which at this point is impossible.
[01:26:10.078 --> 01:26:12.599]  So, people are waking up.
[01:26:12.599 --> 01:26:18.022]  I'm glad to see so many grassroots organizations forming.
[01:26:18.022 --> 01:26:24.445]  And I'm glad to see people training and teaming up and preparing.
[01:26:25.273 --> 01:26:30.897]  For the dark days ahead, because things could get very, very bad before they get better.
[01:26:30.897 --> 01:26:36.101]  And I think it's important that people team up.
[01:26:36.101 --> 01:26:40.965]  They've got to be in the right place at the right time with the right friends to get through this.
[01:26:40.965 --> 01:26:50.051]  And if people aren't thinking in those terms, if they aren't thinking strategically, then they're just going to end up another statistic and they're just going to be another refugee on the road.
[01:26:51.723 --> 01:26:58.064]  If the 20th century taught us anything, it's that the life of a refugee is nasty, brutish, and short.
[01:26:58.064 --> 01:27:00.024]  You don't want to be a refugee.
[01:27:00.024 --> 01:27:03.625]  You want to plan your out now.
[01:27:03.625 --> 01:27:06.186]  People should relocate.
[01:27:06.186 --> 01:27:09.826]  Just previously, you mentioned Joel Skousen's book, Strategic Relocation.
[01:27:09.826 --> 01:27:20.528]  That's a fantastic book, and I highly recommend it because it gets people thinking along the lines of strategically putting themselves where they need to be for the dark times ahead.
[01:27:21.775 --> 01:27:24.638]  People need to make those moves now.
[01:27:24.638 --> 01:27:28.101]  You can't get out of Dodge at the 11th hour.
[01:27:28.101 --> 01:27:31.384]  I noticed that you started doing some of your videos from home.
[01:27:31.384 --> 01:27:39.992]  And I encourage that because people have to think about strictly operating out of their homes, hunkering down for extended periods of time.
[01:27:39.992 --> 01:27:45.818]  Because there may come a time in the very near future where it simply isn't safe to commute into the big city.
[01:27:47.256 --> 01:28:00.780]  People have to think in terms of conquering down, living self-sufficiently as much as possible, making their own power, pumping their own water up out of the ground, growing their own food, raising their own livestock, and providing for their own security.
[01:28:00.780 --> 01:28:09.603]  Because all those systems, if we depend on others for them, are probably going to be going away.
[01:28:09.603 --> 01:28:14.565]  And anyone who's not prepared to face that new paradigm is going to become
[01:28:16.837 --> 01:28:23.319]  Now I want to raise this point to you, and we're going to break here in a moment and come back, but start answering it now.
[01:28:23.319 --> 01:28:31.862]  Again, you don't toot your own horn, but you were, almost two decades ago, able to foresee much of what is now unfolding.
[01:28:32.930 --> 01:28:37.031]  And you even predicted the time frame with great accuracy.
[01:28:37.031 --> 01:28:38.831]  I know the future is fluid.
[01:28:38.831 --> 01:28:42.452]  There's different futures there depending on what we do.
[01:28:42.452 --> 01:29:00.155]  But seeing the awakening, tracking its trajectory versus the tyrant's trajectory, A, what do you think the future holds if you had to give us a general dead reckoning analysis?
[01:29:00.155 --> 01:29:00.175]  A,
[01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:12.105]  Well, I think I can foresee an economic collapse regardless of what anyone does at this point.
[01:29:12.105 --> 01:29:19.609]  Because the level of debt that's built up globally, globally has gotten so large that it's absolutely unsustainable.
[01:29:20.507 --> 01:29:29.232]  Under a traditional interest-based debt economy, for those debts to be repaid, it's mathematically impossible.
[01:29:29.232 --> 01:29:37.898]  So I think we're going to see a global economic collapse, and the severity of it depends on a number of different things.
[01:29:37.898 --> 01:29:38.298]  Stay there.
[01:29:38.298 --> 01:29:43.021]  Let's come back and then see how you see all of that interacting within the collapse.
[01:29:43.021 --> 01:29:44.882]  How does it run from bad to worse?
[01:29:44.882 --> 01:29:46.523]  How do we get ready?
[01:29:46.523 --> 01:29:47.744]  With James Wesley Rawls.
[01:29:47.744 --> 01:29:48.144]  Stay with us.
[01:29:50.222 --> 01:29:54.125]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.125 --> 01:29:56.807]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.691 --> 01:30:06.652]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:06.652 --> 01:30:15.515]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:30:15.515 --> 01:30:20.136]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:30:20.136 --> 01:30:30.959]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:30:31.599 --> 01:30:41.102]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:41.102 --> 01:30:46.544]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:30:46.544 --> 01:30:54.027]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:54.027 --> 01:30:56.428]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:31:01.118 --> 01:31:02.178]  I had tried everything.
[01:31:02.178 --> 01:31:07.680]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:12.502]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[01:31:12.502 --> 01:31:18.864]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[01:31:19.364 --> 01:31:30.574]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:31:30.574 --> 01:31:35.058]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[01:31:35.058 --> 01:31:41.324]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:31:41.324 --> 01:31:42.465]  Now that's results!
[01:31:42.865 --> 01:31:55.389]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfoWarsTeam.com and to order just three of their products and you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.
[01:31:55.389 --> 01:31:57.929]  Start your journey to health and wellness today.
[01:31:57.929 --> 01:31:59.230]  InfoWarsTeam.com
[01:32:00.526 --> 01:32:01.826]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:01.826 --> 01:32:07.408]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:32:07.408 --> 01:32:12.430]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:32:12.430 --> 01:32:17.472]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:32:17.992 --> 01:32:23.214]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:32:23.214 --> 01:32:25.534]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:32:25.534 --> 01:32:30.336]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:32:30.336 --> 01:32:31.456]  And here's the best part.
[01:32:31.456 --> 01:32:34.517]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:32:34.517 --> 01:32:37.818]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:32:38.138 --> 01:32:41.320]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:44.482]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:32:44.482 --> 01:32:44.682]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:32:44.682 --> 01:32:48.124]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:32:48.124 --> 01:32:49.865]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:33:09.085 --> 01:33:13.569]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:33:13.569 --> 01:33:18.994]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:18.994 --> 01:33:30.124]  You better believe it, you know, I've had these liners for like 17 years, different variants of, we're in a war, the war is now, leading a frontal assault, info war.
[01:33:30.124 --> 01:33:34.368]  Listen, this is real, okay?
[01:33:34.368 --> 01:33:35.029]  The globalist
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:40.462]  They want to de-industrialize the planet and have giant throngs of poor people that they control.
[01:33:40.462 --> 01:33:46.844]  Then in all their major public documents they say they're going to release bio-weapons after that.
[01:33:46.844 --> 01:33:57.588]  Dick Cheney wrote in the PNAC document in 2000, September 20th, that they need to use the media to promote and legitimize the use of race-specific bio-weapons.
[01:33:57.588 --> 01:34:05.551]  That means killing certain groups of people with a bio-weapon where you release it and all Northern Europeans die, or all Arabs die, or all Chinese die.
[01:34:07.298 --> 01:34:09.200]  You're like, well, they can't tailor it just to Chinese.
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:10.381]  Yeah, they can.
[01:34:10.381 --> 01:34:20.112]  They've got these genomes so targeted where it will kill the dominant Chinese genetic line and not even kill the Japanese.
[01:34:20.112 --> 01:34:25.098]  They've got them so tailored they can kill Arabs of certain derivations and not kill Jews.
[01:34:26.790 --> 01:34:30.533]  And Dick Cheney says we need to use the media to legitimize this.
[01:34:30.533 --> 01:34:32.735]  That's what it is when they've got all these movies and TV shows.
[01:34:32.735 --> 01:34:45.166]  I mean, I already knew this, but they had a C-SPAN event like five years ago where Homeland Security threw a party for some of the people from 24 and said, thank you for working with us.
[01:34:45.166 --> 01:34:50.471]  You've really helped get our image up and, you know, helped promote taking the gloves off and torture, basically.
[01:34:50.471 --> 01:34:51.492]  They said, take them the gloves off.
[01:34:52.398 --> 01:34:56.041]  Secret arrest, torture, disappearing, internal checkpoints.
[01:34:56.041 --> 01:35:01.505]  Cops, watch this, the weak-minded ones, military and others, and start fantasizing.
[01:35:01.505 --> 01:35:06.749]  But because most of them are too professional, they create TSA, which is now on the highways.
[01:35:06.749 --> 01:35:15.155]  They always create a goon force that doesn't go through the original academies that have enough pride to not teach absolute tyranny.
[01:35:15.155 --> 01:35:21.240]  You have to twist somebody that came out of the FBI system or out of the state police academy.
[01:35:21.909 --> 01:35:24.334]  You don't have to twist the TSA.
[01:35:24.334 --> 01:35:25.216]  I'm ranting.
[01:35:25.216 --> 01:35:26.679]  Our guest is here.
[01:35:26.679 --> 01:35:29.826]  Every time I get him on, he gets me thinking and I run on at the mouth.
[01:35:30.871 --> 01:35:35.114]  James Wesley Rawls has been an enthusiastic survivalist since his teenage years.
[01:35:35.114 --> 01:35:42.099]  He is now a survivalist author and lecturer and the editor of survivalblog.com, one of the biggest out there, survivalblog.com.
[01:35:42.099 --> 01:35:50.324]  He has a Bachelor of Arts degree from San Jose State University, minor degree in military science history and military history, a former U.S.
[01:35:50.324 --> 01:35:54.287]  Army intelligence officer who was a captain and attended all the big
[01:35:55.529 --> 01:35:56.730]  Specialized spy schools.
[01:35:56.730 --> 01:35:58.231]  We'll just leave it at that.
[01:35:58.231 --> 01:36:00.433]  But he joins us here.
[01:36:00.433 --> 01:36:01.314]  I just want to plug.
[01:36:01.314 --> 01:36:06.038]  You support the broadcast, what we're doing, and you get vital information.
[01:36:06.038 --> 01:36:07.499]  You may think you know it all.
[01:36:07.499 --> 01:36:13.924]  Reading these books will make you get deeper into the thought process and then pass it on, pay it forward to others.
[01:36:13.924 --> 01:36:17.487]  Behind the green mask, 170 something pages.
[01:36:17.487 --> 01:36:19.829]  Let me give you the technical on that because I'm gonna go from memory here.
[01:36:22.611 --> 01:36:23.572]  Yep.
[01:36:23.572 --> 01:36:25.213]  168 pages.
[01:36:25.213 --> 01:36:26.274]  168 pages.
[01:36:26.274 --> 01:36:30.037]  Give it to city council, county commissioners.
[01:36:30.037 --> 01:36:38.824]  A lot of times when we call some city council person fighting tyranny, they're a listener or somebody gave them my film, they don't believe it, they go look at it, they find out it's true.
[01:36:38.824 --> 01:36:43.508]  Every city council member in your area needs to get this book and we've got it discounted at InfoWars.com.
[01:36:44.855 --> 01:36:49.920]  Everybody needs to read Survivors, James Wesley Rawls' new bestseller book.
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:55.265]  Everybody needs to get strategic relocation with all the documents, maps, color, photos.
[01:36:55.265 --> 01:36:58.267]  I mean, this is a must-have available at InfoWars.com.
[01:36:58.267 --> 01:37:02.892]  We're going to get Joel on for a couple hours on the nightly news, soon to do a whole special on this.
[01:37:02.892 --> 01:37:05.694]  I want to get a bunch of graphics and production ready before we do it.
[01:37:05.694 --> 01:37:06.875]  It may be next week.
[01:37:06.875 --> 01:37:07.356]  The point is,
[01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:09.421]  Win-win-win.
[01:37:09.421 --> 01:37:15.905]  Get the information, spread it around to others, and support us financially and the authors and researchers at fullwars.com.
[01:37:15.905 --> 01:37:19.247]  Or call 888-253-3139 if you want to call and order or have any questions.
[01:37:19.247 --> 01:37:19.347]  888-253-3139.
[01:37:19.347 --> 01:37:21.068]  Or you can write to us at PO Box 19549 Austin, Texas 78760.
[01:37:21.068 --> 01:37:21.208]  Alright.
[01:37:29.930 --> 01:37:32.011]  I get angry knowing this is coming down, okay?
[01:37:32.011 --> 01:37:38.794]  I mean, I believe everything I'm saying and more, because I can't even articulate what I know and understand.
[01:37:38.794 --> 01:37:48.059]  That's why I tend to blow up, because I'm sick of it, and I'm tired of the public being simple-minded and not wanting to understand things, or coming back with canned responses.
[01:37:48.059 --> 01:37:50.420]  The globalists are digging in.
[01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:52.181]  The government is digging in.
[01:37:52.181 --> 01:37:56.503]  The bankers who did this are all digging into armored redoubts, on record.
[01:37:58.180 --> 01:37:59.302]  Okay?
[01:37:59.302 --> 01:38:01.787]  Armored Keeps!
[01:38:01.787 --> 01:38:02.969]  I shouldn't even be here!
[01:38:02.969 --> 01:38:08.059]  I've moved out of the country, got a well, trying to put solar in, don't even have time to mess with it because I'm always down here!
[01:38:08.959 --> 01:38:11.160]  I've got to get communications equipment in.
[01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:13.720]  I've got to get ham radio stuff in, learn how to use it.
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:14.880]  I've got some of it.
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:17.661]  I've got to create, but I can't do everything, is the point.
[01:38:17.661 --> 01:38:19.321]  I've got to do the basics.
[01:38:19.321 --> 01:38:26.583]  Firearms, ammo, training, food, medical supplies, most importantly, friends.
[01:38:26.583 --> 01:38:34.725]  But we're going to get into, if you can stay a little bit in the next hour, we'll do 20 minutes or so on solutions, James, and take a few calls, and some of the basics that you write about at yoursurvivalblog.com.
[01:38:36.005 --> 01:38:41.396]  But let's expand here for a moment into my question that I just posed in the last segment.
[01:38:43.931 --> 01:38:44.872]  Is the collapse coming?
[01:38:44.872 --> 01:38:45.832]  You said yes.
[01:38:45.832 --> 01:38:48.534]  What are the severities from your research?
[01:38:48.534 --> 01:38:51.796]  And again, how do you see it shaking out?
[01:38:51.796 --> 01:38:54.457]  How do you see the collision being like?
[01:38:54.457 --> 01:38:55.318]  How bad will it be?
[01:38:55.318 --> 01:38:56.098]  Because people don't know.
[01:38:56.098 --> 01:39:04.403]  7 million people, major universities estimate, starved to death or died from complications of malnutrition during the 10 years, roughly, of the Great Depression.
[01:39:04.403 --> 01:39:05.083]  Look it up, folks.
[01:39:05.083 --> 01:39:07.205]  Just type in 7 million died during the Great Depression.
[01:39:07.205 --> 01:39:08.625]  Major university studies.
[01:39:08.625 --> 01:39:10.306]  They kept it quiet.
[01:39:10.306 --> 01:39:12.408]  90% were semi-self-sufficient.
[01:39:12.408 --> 01:39:12.848]  Now we're
[01:39:14.248 --> 01:39:21.931]  89% city, 11% rural, only half of that, what, 5.5% or so are self-sufficient.
[01:39:21.931 --> 01:39:26.893]  And what's going to happen is the government is preparing to come in and basically commandeer stuff.
[01:39:26.893 --> 01:39:28.534]  But they don't have the infrastructure.
[01:39:28.534 --> 01:39:30.494]  And people are going to start fighting back.
[01:39:30.494 --> 01:39:31.995]  You're going to be called terrorist.
[01:39:31.995 --> 01:39:33.576]  Once you're called terrorist, so what?
[01:39:33.576 --> 01:39:42.419]  I mean, what is the probability of massive bloodshed when the Fed boys come around with their armored warwags trying to, you know, pilfer the women?
[01:39:42.819 --> 01:39:44.320]  Go ahead.
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:47.762]  Well, it's hard to say what the severity of it will be.
[01:39:47.762 --> 01:39:51.944]  We'll definitely have an economic collapse coming.
[01:39:51.944 --> 01:39:57.488]  At the near end of the spectrum would be a repeat of the depression of the 1930s.
[01:39:57.488 --> 01:40:07.514]  But as you mentioned, we live in a society that's far less self-sufficient and far more technologically dependent than the society of the 1930s.
[01:40:07.514 --> 01:40:10.956]  So that even with just a repeat of the depression of the 30s,
[01:40:11.966 --> 01:40:16.329]  We're going to see quite a bit of loss of life.
[01:40:16.329 --> 01:40:19.611]  The far end of the spectrum would be a total collapse.
[01:40:19.611 --> 01:40:22.033]  The situation just snowballing completely out of control.
[01:40:22.033 --> 01:40:28.658]  If power grids go down, and there's actually three grids, they go down, all bets are off.
[01:40:28.658 --> 01:40:36.483]  If the grids go down, we could see the cities running out of drinking water within 72 hours.
[01:40:39.557 --> 01:40:41.440]  The reactors are going to start melting down.
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:43.383]  They can't even keep it from melting down now.
[01:40:43.383 --> 01:40:45.406]  Society's so degenerate.
[01:40:45.406 --> 01:40:54.819]  Yeah, that's the other wild card in the whole situation is not the reactors themselves, but it's more the cooling ponds that are at risk.
[01:40:56.536 --> 01:41:11.103]  Part of the environmental regulations and one of the things that the Green Revolution brought us was all this foot-dragging about Yucca Mountain and a safe place to store spent nuclear fuel rods.
[01:41:11.103 --> 01:41:24.990]  So for the last 15 years, all those spent rods have been building up and building up and building up right at the reactor sites in these enormous spent fuel cooling ponds.
[01:41:24.990 --> 01:41:25.770]  Well, the ponds
[01:41:26.747 --> 01:41:38.654]  have such a high density of spent fuel in them now that they require constant replenishment of cool water from outside, or they boil off.
[01:41:38.654 --> 01:41:44.017]  And once the ponds boil off, they'll melt down just like at Fukushima.
[01:41:44.017 --> 01:41:48.039]  Well, that's the case for reactors all the way from coast to coast.
[01:41:48.039 --> 01:41:56.004]  And one of the reasons that I stress moving to the inland Northwest states is that we're upwind of most of the nuclear power plants.
[01:41:56.872 --> 01:42:12.623]  Anyone who's downwind, they better think in terms of having a home fallout shelter, because we could have unintentional fallout coming from all of these nuclear fuel ponds that melt down.
[01:42:12.623 --> 01:42:17.707]  There's so many risks out there, they're almost impossible to count.
[01:42:17.707 --> 01:42:20.469]  And it's a cascade of risks.
[01:42:20.469 --> 01:42:23.071]  There's a cascade of events if the power grid goes down.
[01:42:24.162 --> 01:42:27.547]  The 18-wheel trucks are not going to be rolling.
[01:42:27.547 --> 01:42:33.115]  The nuclear power plants are going to be failing and their cooling ponds will be melting down.
[01:42:33.115 --> 01:42:38.202]  We're going to see all the automated reordering systems for
[01:42:39.349 --> 01:42:46.412]  Virtually every aspect of our modern commerce will come to a screeching halt because it's all computer controlled.
[01:42:46.412 --> 01:42:54.415]  And then people say, oh Alex, just to interrupt briefly, people say, oh Alex, or oh Wesley, the reactors have their own power.
[01:42:54.415 --> 01:42:58.816]  If stuff's failing down the line, they can only send massive amounts of power.
[01:42:58.816 --> 01:43:00.117]  They can't sit there and
[01:43:00.657 --> 01:43:02.378]  The level of complexity that exists now
[01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:29.340]  It keeps growing.
[01:43:29.340 --> 01:43:31.341]  It keeps growing year by year.
[01:43:31.341 --> 01:43:41.483]  The latest on the power grids is there's an effort right now to do an intertie between the eastern grid, the western grid, and the Texas grid.
[01:43:41.483 --> 01:43:50.424]  So even if one grid were to stay up, if they do this intertie, all the grids will collapse simultaneously.
[01:43:50.424 --> 01:43:54.025]  The level of complexity keeps going up year after year.
[01:43:54.901 --> 01:43:59.786]  The level of interdependence of these systems keeps going up.
[01:43:59.786 --> 01:44:05.591]  So the level of vulnerability keeps going up year after year.
[01:44:05.591 --> 01:44:09.975]  It's really a wonder we haven't seen a large-scale grid collapse already.
[01:44:09.975 --> 01:44:16.922]  And when you take outside factors into play,
[01:44:18.257 --> 01:44:24.542]  Not just the grid itself and its complexity, but things like EMP or things like solar flares.
[01:44:24.542 --> 01:44:30.447]  You could very well have a situation where the grid could go down and stay down.
[01:44:30.447 --> 01:44:36.291]  Alright, specifically, the financial collapse is going to cause massive crime increase.
[01:44:36.291 --> 01:44:37.792]  We're already seeing it.
[01:44:37.792 --> 01:44:39.394]  How is that going to affect things?
[01:44:39.394 --> 01:44:43.437]  And when you talk about refugees on the road, break that down.
[01:44:43.803 --> 01:44:53.627]  Well, basically all the urban areas will be total write-offs and the suburbs are going to get swarmed by refugees from the urban areas.
[01:44:53.627 --> 01:45:04.171]  There will be so many people that find their urban and suburban homes uninhabitable that there will be a huge number of refugees.
[01:45:04.171 --> 01:45:11.894]  Once the water no longer magically comes out of the tap and the lights don't magically come on when you flip the switch and the toilets don't flush,
[01:45:14.181 --> 01:45:18.702]  Your typical urban apartment building is going to be absolutely uninhabitable.
[01:45:18.702 --> 01:45:21.583]  It'll be a public health nightmare.
[01:45:21.583 --> 01:45:25.404]  We'll have refugees on the road within just a few days.
[01:45:25.404 --> 01:45:31.726]  And if you look at it demographically, we now have 2% of the population feeding the other 98%.
[01:45:35.405 --> 01:45:38.346]  What happens to the farmers that live fairly close to the suburbs?
[01:45:38.346 --> 01:45:39.826]  They're going to get swarmed.
[01:45:39.826 --> 01:45:48.249]  So suddenly, you know, we're going to be a situation where even if farmers are still producing, how are they going to get their crops to market?
[01:45:48.249 --> 01:45:55.691]  How are they going to live in safety to even feel safe running trucks and tractors and their farm equipment or taking care of their livestock?
[01:45:55.982 --> 01:46:09.768]  And the globalists are going to show up after all this collapse and bring in collectivism to quote, fix it, and we're going to have all the people from the cities telling us that we've got to share with them and that we're their slaves, and the government's going to hand them machine guns.
[01:46:09.768 --> 01:46:11.469]  That's probably what's going to happen.
[01:46:11.469 --> 01:46:12.670]  Yes, that very well could be.
[01:46:12.670 --> 01:46:21.594]  You know, if you look at politics, I mean, just look at what happened with the collectivism in Stalinism and what happened to the kulaks.
[01:46:24.710 --> 01:46:40.279]  Siberia, and in the Ukraine in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, there was depopulation because they literally, they tried to implement collectivism.
[01:46:40.279 --> 01:46:41.660]  People rebelled.
[01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:46.923]  Anyone who hid their crops was treated as a traitor and shot on sight.
[01:46:46.923 --> 01:46:51.686]  And then they ended up having killed the people who knew how to produce things.
[01:46:51.686 --> 01:46:54.388]  And they ended up with a downward spiral.
[01:46:55.333 --> 01:47:02.858]  We could very well see the same situation in our country, but the situation could be even worse because, again, we have only 2% of the population feeding the other 98%.
[01:47:02.858 --> 01:47:12.965]  The people that have the know-how to feed America, it's a fairly small number of people.
[01:47:12.965 --> 01:47:19.189]  If we end up in a societal collapse situation, people are going to end up eating the golden goose, basically.
[01:47:20.390 --> 01:47:23.864]  Let me ask you this question, it wouldn't be the first time it's happened in history.
[01:47:23.864 --> 01:47:25.832]  In your own mind, personally...
[01:47:26.943 --> 01:47:31.545]  When do you decide to take action defensively?
[01:47:31.545 --> 01:47:34.646]  I mean, people are climbing over your fence, over your wall.
[01:47:34.646 --> 01:47:36.787]  Come on, give us food, we need it!
[01:47:36.787 --> 01:47:38.067]  And then you're like, you owe it to us!
[01:47:38.067 --> 01:47:40.488]  And they pull a shotgun out.
[01:47:40.488 --> 01:47:46.370]  Or the local cops under Homeland pull up and demand house to house, give us your storable food.
[01:47:46.370 --> 01:47:47.350]  It comes down to that.
[01:47:47.350 --> 01:47:49.971]  You're in a very dicey situation.
[01:47:49.971 --> 01:47:54.433]  If it's a situation with looters, I would predict that
[01:47:55.100 --> 01:48:03.362]  In the majority of situations, if you start cranking off a few rounds over the heads of looters, they're going to go find somebody else to go loot.
[01:48:03.362 --> 01:48:05.782]  They'll find a softer target.
[01:48:05.782 --> 01:48:13.084]  If you come up against your own local government, that's a very sticky situation, and one that's almost imponderable.
[01:48:13.084 --> 01:48:15.944]  All I can say is, don't put all your eggs in one basket.
[01:48:15.944 --> 01:48:24.166]  You need to have food cached in several different places, preferably underground, so that if somebody comes and takes part of it, they're not going to get all of it.
[01:48:25.310 --> 01:48:35.452]  Yeah, I'm not talking about what they should do, but the point that government, which we're used to, you know, robbing us a hundred different ways, is trying to... My point is, if they come and want to take food or something, that's one issue.
[01:48:35.452 --> 01:48:53.997]  The minute anybody tries to take my family, or we're taking you into custody because the homeland says, you cannot go to that horrible, sprawling prison structure they're going to have, because it's going to be run and peopled by, you know, bestial perverts that like to inhabit such facilities.
[01:48:55.492 --> 01:49:02.499]  Yeah, the last thing you want to be is either a refugee or prisoner in a situation like that.
[01:49:02.499 --> 01:49:06.343]  All I can say is people need to be able to stand their ground.
[01:49:06.343 --> 01:49:15.252]  They need to plan in advance and think through the situations of when they'll, you know, basically a fight or flight decision.
[01:49:15.252 --> 01:49:18.535]  When you're going to flee your property, when you're going to stand your ground.
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:31.928]  But the last thing you want to do is end up either a refugee on the road or some guy in the back of a truck with a bag over your head with cable ties around your wrists heading off to points unknown.
[01:49:34.827 --> 01:49:43.612]  And they've certainly, talking to people you know in the government, what percentage are hardcore, you know, psycho types that are really looking forward to all this?
[01:49:43.612 --> 01:49:46.814]  Because from my research, most of them are actually overall good people.
[01:49:46.814 --> 01:49:48.175]  They've just been naive.
[01:49:48.175 --> 01:49:49.835]  They now know this is real.
[01:49:49.835 --> 01:49:52.137]  I don't think a lot of them are actually going to follow the orders.
[01:49:52.657 --> 01:49:57.259]  I think they'll have some well-publicized events to make the mercenaries look like victims.
[01:49:57.259 --> 01:49:59.941]  They're going to try to use mercenaries in a lot of cases.
[01:49:59.941 --> 01:50:03.163]  I don't think they're going to have the muscle early on to do this.
[01:50:03.163 --> 01:50:08.525]  I see it as deep into the collapse, then the reorganizational government comes in.
[01:50:08.525 --> 01:50:19.191]  Right, and that's the scenario I put forth in my novel, Patriots, and its sequel, Survivors, and the next one that's coming out in September is called Founders.
[01:50:19.884 --> 01:50:29.472]  That's basically the situation I put forth there, where there was a collapse and then a power vacuum that was still primarily by foreign mercenaries.
[01:50:29.472 --> 01:50:36.677]  It's difficult to predict what will happen, but all I can say is people need to think these things through and take action.
[01:50:36.677 --> 01:50:38.479]  They need to stock up now.
[01:50:38.479 --> 01:50:46.285]  They need to team up with their like-minded friends and neighbors and fellow church congregants and plan and cross-train and get ready.
[01:50:46.567 --> 01:50:47.327]  All right, stay there.
[01:50:47.327 --> 01:50:51.750]  By the way, I didn't even know you had a new book coming out, but see, it's reality-based, so I can guess it.
[01:50:51.750 --> 01:50:52.970]  I guess it's the foreign U.N.
[01:50:52.970 --> 01:50:55.892]  mercs versus the new founders of the new republic.
[01:50:55.892 --> 01:50:56.592]  Am I right?
[01:50:56.592 --> 01:50:58.013]  We'll find out when we get back.

[01:54:25.133 --> 01:54:25.934]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[01:54:32.382 --> 01:54:34.525]  I hope we're wrong about all this, but unfortunately we're not.
[01:54:34.525 --> 01:54:36.107]  The question is just how bad will it get?
[01:54:36.107 --> 01:54:43.437]  We're just hoping for just a regular depression, but with this spoiled population, not everybody, but certain elements, it's gonna be nasty.
[01:54:43.437 --> 01:54:44.599]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:54:44.599 --> 01:54:44.799]  Specific...
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:53.142]  Mike Adams is going to be popping in the last 15 minutes of the show or so.
[01:54:53.142 --> 01:54:54.043]  I believe we get that set up.
[01:55:11.218 --> 01:55:14.179]  Because he's got breaking news.
[01:55:14.179 --> 01:55:17.599]  It's at Infowars.com and NaturalNews.com.
[01:55:17.599 --> 01:55:23.840]  Remember, the UN model to shut down small farms is to say your pigs and cows are invasive.
[01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:27.221]  It's not a certified, you know, big agri-facility.
[01:55:27.221 --> 01:55:30.161]  So they announced all these dozens of old breeds.
[01:55:30.161 --> 01:55:38.063]  If they have red hair, black hair, spots, whatever, or any other feature, government is going to have, quote, armed raids, arrest you and kill them.
[01:55:38.843 --> 01:55:40.865]  Calling it a feral hog problem.
[01:55:40.865 --> 01:55:45.148]  It's hundreds of years of hogs getting out, interbreeding, and just going wild.
[01:55:45.148 --> 01:55:48.090]  I've shot probably 20 of them or more.
[01:55:48.090 --> 01:55:50.471]  I mean, we've got a family ranch infested with them.
[01:55:50.471 --> 01:55:52.453]  But that's not our pigs.
[01:55:52.453 --> 01:55:56.896]  We used to raise regular pigs out there, you know, the regular old pink ones and others.
[01:55:56.896 --> 01:55:58.057]  I forget all the names of them.
[01:55:58.057 --> 01:56:03.781]  The point is, is that now they take that and use it as a way to create a new revenue.
[01:56:03.781 --> 01:56:05.983]  People said, oh, they're not going to go on farms and kill them.
[01:56:05.983 --> 01:56:07.063]  Don't be a fear monger.
[01:56:07.063 --> 01:56:07.544]  It's happened.
[01:56:09.008 --> 01:56:15.451]  Michigan government unleashes armed raids on small pig farmers, forces farmer to shoot all his own pigs.
[01:56:15.451 --> 01:56:17.752]  Armed raids, it's all happening.
[01:56:17.752 --> 01:56:21.454]  It's at Infowars.com right now by Mike Adams.
[01:56:21.454 --> 01:56:29.358]  I want to get into some solutions real quicker with you, but what do you make of the harassment, the animal ID, premises ID, which then Big Agra is exempt from?
[01:56:30.267 --> 01:56:43.297]  Yeah, it all ties back to the NAIS, which is the National Animal Identification System, which was an abortive system they tried setting up several years ago, but they never really quit.
[01:56:43.297 --> 01:56:48.501]  They basically are doing the same thing and calling it a different name.
[01:56:48.501 --> 01:56:52.724]  And you're right, they will be exempting the major producers.
[01:56:52.724 --> 01:56:55.767]  Same thing, by the way, is in the works right now.
[01:56:55.767 --> 01:56:57.548]  There's calls for
[01:56:59.116 --> 01:57:18.764]  Veterinary medicines to be restricted to only being released by prescription and that's going to make it life difficult for small farmers and of course for anyone who's preparedness minded who's laid in a supply of inexpensive animal antibiotics to use in the event of a societal collapse.
[01:57:18.764 --> 01:57:21.645]  Well that supply will be going away.
[01:57:21.645 --> 01:57:25.426]  And of course, yeah, they'll probably exempt major producers.
[01:57:25.426 --> 01:57:26.967]  I recently wrote about that in my blog.
[01:57:28.376 --> 01:57:31.038]  Yeah, they're going to turn the DEA loose, basically.
[01:57:31.038 --> 01:57:32.720]  Federal goons.
[01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:35.642]  I mean, everybody knows you're running even a hundred head of cattle.
[01:57:35.642 --> 01:57:36.803]  You've got antibiotics.
[01:57:36.803 --> 01:57:39.285]  You've got other shots you've got to give them.
[01:57:39.285 --> 01:57:40.566]  You buy it from the vet.
[01:57:40.566 --> 01:57:41.908]  You're not doing that anymore.
[01:57:41.908 --> 01:57:47.072]  Yeah, of course, it'll just be the small producers they clamp down on.
[01:57:47.072 --> 01:57:54.078]  They'll exempt the major producers and say, oh, well, you won't require a veterinarian prescription.
[01:57:54.952 --> 01:58:02.737]  But, for anybody who has just a few cows, or a few sheep, or a few goats, then you're going to be behind the age of... And they're the ones that lobby for it.
[01:58:02.737 --> 01:58:14.845]  Just last year, 15 mil was spent in one week trying to put the Safe Food Act through, which was written by Big Agra to shut down, where you can't even pick strawberries and serve them to your neighbor.
[01:58:14.845 --> 01:58:16.646]  I mean, just total tyranny.
[01:58:16.646 --> 01:58:20.989]  As I mentioned at the beginning of our conversation, we are living in the age of deception and betrayal.
[01:58:22.162 --> 01:58:29.005]  We're just a bunch of cold-blooded multinational corporations that are monopoly men in an anti-free market saying, turn this place into a prison.
[01:58:29.005 --> 01:58:32.486]  If it isn't bought from our big box store, it's shut down.
[01:58:32.486 --> 01:58:35.728]  And the FBI and the rest of the government's like, yes sir!
[01:58:35.728 --> 01:58:41.590]  We'll be back in 60 seconds with some solutions and your calls.

[02:00:05.697 --> 02:00:10.520]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.520 --> 02:00:12.121]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.121 --> 02:00:13.663]  Well, so does he.

[02:00:22.168 --> 02:00:25.571]  Alright, your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:25.571 --> 02:00:30.474]  Shoot, I might just twist our gift right to the 30 after, because then we got Mike Adams coming on.
[02:00:30.474 --> 02:00:32.015]  I got a bunch of other news I haven't even gotten to.
[02:00:32.015 --> 02:00:33.957]  It's all just crazy.
[02:00:35.410 --> 02:00:44.476]  Whatever tyrannical governments have done in the past, the crooks that run ours are taking it, dusting it off, updating it, and using it.
[02:00:44.476 --> 02:00:47.838]  It's just, we've got cancer as a country and as a world.
[02:00:47.838 --> 02:00:48.939]  It's called the New World Order.
[02:00:48.939 --> 02:00:50.220]  1776 worldwide is the solution.
[02:00:53.749 --> 02:00:56.190]  We have James Wesley Rawls, best-selling author, our guest.
[02:00:56.190 --> 02:00:57.551]  We're going to go to your calls in the next segment.
[02:00:57.551 --> 02:01:02.253]  Let's get into a few practical basics people can do now.
[02:01:02.253 --> 02:01:05.475]  Because the most common call I get is, I live in a city.
[02:01:05.475 --> 02:01:07.316]  I make, you know, 12 bucks an hour.
[02:01:07.316 --> 02:01:08.756]  My wife does.
[02:01:08.756 --> 02:01:12.318]  You know, we got a comfortable blue-collar existence, but that's it.
[02:01:12.318 --> 02:01:13.799]  We don't have money for anything.
[02:01:13.799 --> 02:01:15.600]  What do we do?
[02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:21.583]  Well, I recommend that people reorder their budget priorities.
[02:01:22.398 --> 02:01:27.481]  It's time for people to do away with their cable TV subscription.
[02:01:27.481 --> 02:01:30.803]  It's time for them to sell their flat screen television.
[02:01:30.803 --> 02:01:32.925]  Sell their jet ski.
[02:01:32.925 --> 02:01:34.285]  Get back to the basics.
[02:01:34.285 --> 02:01:41.450]  Try to work down your debt and stock up on all the basics.
[02:01:41.450 --> 02:01:43.451]  All your staple foods.
[02:01:43.451 --> 02:01:45.372]  Get a good reliable weapon.
[02:01:45.372 --> 02:01:46.513]  Practice with it.
[02:01:46.513 --> 02:01:48.914]  Train with it to the best of your ability.
[02:01:48.914 --> 02:01:49.675]  If you can't afford
[02:01:50.430 --> 02:02:02.274]  To go to a top-flight school like Front Sight or Gun Sight or Thunder Ranch, then at least get training locally through your local NRA affiliate.
[02:02:02.274 --> 02:02:04.314]  Get involved with the Apple Seed Program.
[02:02:04.314 --> 02:02:06.475]  They offer excellent training.
[02:02:06.475 --> 02:02:09.076]  But get your basics squared away.
[02:02:09.076 --> 02:02:15.818]  If you don't have a six-month supply of food for your family squared away, you're behind the power curve.
[02:02:16.559 --> 02:02:24.266]  If you don't have the money for that, you need to sell your Hummel Collection, sell your Stamp Collection, whatever it takes.
[02:02:24.266 --> 02:02:33.114]  Skip taking your vacation this year and reprioritize your budget and get those basics squared away.
[02:02:33.114 --> 02:02:37.739]  Get a good quality water filter.
[02:02:37.739 --> 02:02:41.462]  Make arrangements to, if you live in a typical suburban house, to
[02:02:43.504 --> 02:02:49.428]  Set up your downspout so you can capture rainwater off your roof.
[02:02:49.428 --> 02:02:52.610]  Get squared away with non-hybrid gardening seeds.
[02:02:52.610 --> 02:02:57.313]  If you don't have fencing to keep deer out, get the fencing in.
[02:02:57.313 --> 02:03:02.397]  You're going to have to plan through all these different things to be ready for the tough times ahead.
[02:03:02.397 --> 02:03:06.820]  And by the way, like you said, you can do the rainwater thing into barrels incredibly inexpensively.
[02:03:06.820 --> 02:03:09.021]  And I've got a rainwater collection system.
[02:03:09.021 --> 02:03:10.762]  It's just incredibly good water.
[02:03:10.762 --> 02:03:12.243]  Comes off my metal roof into it.
[02:03:12.243 --> 02:03:12.944]  I've got great water.
[02:03:13.666 --> 02:03:16.248]  Yeah, I highly recommend that.
[02:03:16.248 --> 02:03:34.262]  And for anyone who lives in West Texas, for example, who lives in a fairly arid area, if you don't have photovoltaics and are set up to pump water from a well with that, six months out of the year, you're going to be out of luck.
[02:03:34.262 --> 02:03:39.066]  So it's important that people get those things squared away.
[02:03:39.066 --> 02:03:43.449]  And the available supplies on these things are actually fairly thin.
[02:03:44.193 --> 02:03:50.038]  In the number of companies that do long-term storage food, there's just a handful of them.
[02:03:50.038 --> 02:04:01.948]  If the demand were to double, and instead of 1% of the population preparing, 2% prepared, the long-term storage food manufacturers could be completely overwhelmed.
[02:04:01.948 --> 02:04:03.470]  And that's starting to already happen.
[02:04:03.470 --> 02:04:09.155]  Yeah, and ditto though for people who make photovoltaics.
[02:04:09.155 --> 02:04:10.716]  There just aren't enough
[02:04:11.858 --> 02:04:16.762]  And notice government only gives you a tax deduction when you tie into them.
[02:04:16.762 --> 02:04:16.882]  Right.
[02:04:38.291 --> 02:04:47.961]  So, um, people need to re- again, re-prioritize their budgets, sell off the frippery, and get those beans, bullets, and band-aids squared away.
[02:04:47.961 --> 02:04:51.885]  I have a lot of details at my blog site, again, survivalblog.com.
[02:04:51.885 --> 02:04:54.107]  All the archives are available free of charge.
[02:04:54.107 --> 02:04:57.491]  Just dig in, and team up with like-minded people.
[02:04:57.491 --> 02:04:58.011]  Exactly.
[02:04:58.011 --> 02:04:58.472]  Stay there.
[02:04:58.472 --> 02:04:59.233]  Back in three minutes.
[02:05:01.516 --> 02:05:08.159]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:05:08.159 --> 02:05:13.302]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:05:13.302 --> 02:05:22.026]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:05:22.026 --> 02:05:26.088]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:05:26.088 --> 02:05:28.049]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:05:30.390 --> 02:05:35.111]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:05:35.111 --> 02:05:38.953]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[02:05:38.953 --> 02:05:40.173]  Others don't.
[02:05:40.173 --> 02:05:42.314]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:05:42.314 --> 02:05:44.114]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:05:44.114 --> 02:05:46.995]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:05:46.995 --> 02:05:53.617]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:05:53.617 --> 02:05:56.318]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:05:56.318 --> 02:05:58.679]  Diamond Gusset Jeans, got it.
[02:05:58.679 --> 02:05:59.199]  Others don't.
[02:06:00.874 --> 02:06:08.098]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, I was still starving.
[02:06:08.098 --> 02:06:25.988]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:06:25.988 --> 02:06:30.110]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[02:06:30.370 --> 02:06:32.131]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[02:06:32.131 --> 02:06:40.317]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[02:06:40.317 --> 02:06:46.621]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[02:06:46.621 --> 02:06:47.902]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:06:47.902 --> 02:06:48.782]  It's incredible.
[02:06:48.782 --> 02:06:57.989]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[02:06:57.989 --> 02:06:59.870]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[02:07:01.791 --> 02:07:03.512]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:07:03.512 --> 02:07:08.814]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:07:08.814 --> 02:07:10.355]  Saving means to make money.
[02:07:10.355 --> 02:07:19.139]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:07:19.879 --> 02:07:27.405]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:07:27.405 --> 02:07:35.412]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:07:35.412 --> 02:07:40.656]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[02:07:40.656 --> 02:07:42.838]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:07:45.540 --> 02:07:48.821]  You are listening to an Infowars.com Frontline Report.
[02:08:13.708 --> 02:08:17.577]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:20.845 --> 02:08:27.608]  Mike Adams is popping in with the Agenda 21 attack on your farm animals, calling them invasive species.
[02:08:27.608 --> 02:08:33.870]  Armed men show up for just regular breeds of pigs, shoot them, and then give you giant fines or arrest you.
[02:08:33.870 --> 02:08:35.711]  No warrants, no nothing.
[02:08:35.711 --> 02:08:38.092]  All confirmed at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:08:38.092 --> 02:08:39.172]  Top story.
[02:08:39.172 --> 02:08:43.114]  Mike Adams is going to be popping in for about 10 minutes via video Skype.
[02:08:43.114 --> 02:08:44.855]  He's the guy that broke it over at Natural News.
[02:08:45.535 --> 02:08:52.741]  And then I'm going to show you the high-def footage and audio of our crew with the chicken farmer on his own land.
[02:08:52.741 --> 02:08:55.843]  The city kept announcing areas, said, you're not allowed to have chickens.
[02:08:55.843 --> 02:08:57.484]  He was loving the community.
[02:08:57.484 --> 02:08:59.026]  Blew his house up.
[02:08:59.026 --> 02:09:01.868]  And the police told us you're not allowed to go on the city council building.
[02:09:01.868 --> 02:09:04.190]  Big, giant, capital-sized thing.
[02:09:04.190 --> 02:09:05.711]  That's all on tape.
[02:09:05.711 --> 02:09:08.793]  Before, it was just our reporters calling in, talking about it.
[02:09:08.793 --> 02:09:09.434]  They're now here.
[02:09:10.393 --> 02:09:12.795]  They're back, got back Saturday.
[02:09:12.795 --> 02:09:15.597]  And so we're going to premiere that coming up on the nightly news.
[02:09:15.597 --> 02:09:18.218]  I'm going to get into the big attacks on the Internet.
[02:09:18.218 --> 02:09:23.902]  Don't think you can just use and have the Internet like it's always going to be here.
[02:09:23.902 --> 02:09:26.204]  I mean, I was reading the Cybersecurity Act that makes soap up.
[02:09:27.082 --> 02:09:29.843]  Look tame and it just says we'll do whatever we want.
[02:09:29.843 --> 02:09:31.803]  We'll shut your website down for any reason.
[02:09:31.803 --> 02:09:32.763]  Internet IDs.
[02:09:32.763 --> 02:09:36.764]  Cass Sunstein says arrest people that disagree with man-made global warming.
[02:09:36.764 --> 02:09:39.525]  I mean these are authoritarians.
[02:09:39.525 --> 02:09:52.948]  But they've learned the art to like pose as liberals or to pose as conservatives and act real friendly and have an ice cream cone like Warren Buffett does in most photo ops or you know be like talk with an NPR lisp.
[02:09:54.266 --> 02:09:55.907]  That is a Delphi technique.
[02:09:55.907 --> 02:10:01.769]  Well, that's a technique specifically of getting people to tell you what they think and then going, oh, we'll do what you want.
[02:10:01.769 --> 02:10:04.310]  You know, you ask the crowd, what do you want?
[02:10:04.310 --> 02:10:05.671]  We want vanilla ice cream.
[02:10:05.671 --> 02:10:08.272]  You go, well, I heard what you wanted.
[02:10:08.272 --> 02:10:10.833]  You want strawberry.
[02:10:10.833 --> 02:10:15.435]  But they just as long as they say it and that I want to go to some calls with.
[02:10:16.514 --> 02:10:21.156]  Our guest, and by the way, we sell his book, Survivors, James Wesley Rawls.
[02:10:21.156 --> 02:10:28.599]  He's an expert, former army intelligence captain, best-selling author, and he runs survivalblog.com as well.
[02:10:28.599 --> 02:10:31.621]  But I want to get your take on that, just the sickening shy-off.
[02:10:31.621 --> 02:10:32.641]  Do you agree with me?
[02:10:32.641 --> 02:10:41.405]  I mean, I know it's their cover, but this whole non-threatening act they do to get you to comply, then if you don't, they stick the men in black uniforms on you.
[02:10:41.405 --> 02:10:44.026]  But it's just this whole non-threatening cover.
[02:10:45.546 --> 02:10:46.367]  Yes, I agree.
[02:10:46.367 --> 02:10:56.418]  The modus operandi seems to be, it's what Mark from Michigan used to refer to as the iron fist in the velvet glove.
[02:10:56.418 --> 02:10:58.801]  And what we're seeing is the velvet glove.
[02:10:58.801 --> 02:11:06.009]  We're seeing all this mamby-pamby, green revolution,
[02:11:07.867 --> 02:11:11.269]  Thank you for doing all that you do, Mr. Rawls.
[02:11:11.269 --> 02:11:13.470]  I have a few questions for you.
[02:11:13.470 --> 02:11:13.930]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:11:35.982 --> 02:11:37.542]  One at a time, please.
[02:11:37.542 --> 02:11:38.723]  Okay, one at a time, thank you.
[02:11:38.723 --> 02:11:41.523]  A bit overwhelming.
[02:11:41.523 --> 02:11:53.306]  I try to talk to my family and try to warn them about things that are going on, things that Mr. Jones talk about daily, and I get laughed at, they call me crazy.
[02:11:53.306 --> 02:11:58.568]  I show them documents that I print off from the printer and show them.
[02:11:58.568 --> 02:12:02.769]  One of my questions is, when would it be time to say,
[02:12:03.743 --> 02:12:07.025]  If it's not going to get any better, it's going to get much worse.
[02:12:07.025 --> 02:12:12.147]  When is it time for me to abandon my home and go somewhere else?
[02:12:12.147 --> 02:12:19.211]  You don't want to give up a paying job in a down economy until you develop another income stream.
[02:12:19.211 --> 02:12:27.715]  You know, my blog is all oriented toward encouraging people to move to lightly populated rural farming areas that are well removed from major population centers.
[02:12:28.669 --> 02:12:30.930]  But, you know, that's not going to work for everybody.
[02:12:30.930 --> 02:12:37.192]  A lot of people have either family situations or work situations where they have to stay where they are.
[02:12:37.192 --> 02:12:45.514]  If you can develop another income stream, or find a job in a lightly populated area, I recommend you go ahead and make the move now.
[02:12:45.514 --> 02:12:51.776]  But, to throw away a good paying job in today's down economy, I think is foolish.
[02:12:52.700 --> 02:12:56.463]  You really don't want to make the move until you have another income.
[02:12:56.463 --> 02:12:56.983]  Exactly.
[02:12:56.983 --> 02:13:03.647]  You want to start building with just the firearm, the water, being prepared, warning others, they'll laugh at you now, not later.
[02:13:03.647 --> 02:13:06.609]  And then begin to start looking for areas.
[02:13:06.609 --> 02:13:08.570]  Where could I go somewhere rural?
[02:13:08.570 --> 02:13:14.134]  And even if the job pays less, it costs less to live there.
[02:13:14.134 --> 02:13:17.076]  And so just start developing a plan.
[02:13:17.076 --> 02:13:18.337]  I agree wholeheartedly.
[02:13:18.337 --> 02:13:21.819]  And it's important that people think these things through.
[02:13:22.719 --> 02:13:27.361]  Be prayerful about it, because you want to have God's guidance on us.
[02:13:27.361 --> 02:13:31.862]  And once you're committed, though, then go ahead.
[02:13:31.862 --> 02:13:36.244]  Then it's time to, you know, go ahead and sell your house, make the move.
[02:13:36.244 --> 02:13:46.307]  And it's important to make a move fairly soon, because, you know, I get so many emails from people who say, oh, well, I have this cabin prepared out in the woods in the Poconos or wherever.
[02:13:47.214 --> 02:13:54.299]  And I'll pull through just fine there, but people don't realize how long it takes to build up for self-sufficiency.
[02:13:54.299 --> 02:13:55.881]  You need to plant fruit and nut trees.
[02:13:55.881 --> 02:13:57.222]  That takes years.
[02:13:57.222 --> 02:14:00.864]  You need to practice gardening in that particular climate.
[02:14:00.864 --> 02:14:02.706]  That takes time and experience.
[02:14:02.706 --> 02:14:06.068]  You need to learn how to cook on a wood stove.
[02:14:06.068 --> 02:14:08.170]  You don't learn that sort of thing just overnight.
[02:14:08.917 --> 02:14:11.979]  So it's important that you make the move and start living.
[02:14:11.979 --> 02:14:19.722]  And you need to meet the neighbors because you don't want to even really at first be a little friendly, but you're really just getting intelligence on them.
[02:14:19.722 --> 02:14:23.904]  You'll find out who's good and you'll find out also who's a little global minion.
[02:14:23.904 --> 02:14:25.986]  And believe me, they're out there too.
[02:14:25.986 --> 02:14:26.266]  Right.
[02:14:26.266 --> 02:14:32.729]  And if you don't want to be the expendable new guy, the guy who just blew into town at the 11th hour,
[02:14:33.876 --> 02:14:37.758]  Just before everything fell apart, you want to become part of the community.
[02:14:37.758 --> 02:14:44.022]  You want to get involved in the local EMT or fire department or volunteer fire department, for example.
[02:14:44.022 --> 02:14:49.765]  It's important to be part of the community because you want to be seen as an insider, not an outsider.
[02:14:49.765 --> 02:14:50.265]  Exactly.
[02:14:50.265 --> 02:14:52.227]  All right, God bless you.
[02:14:52.227 --> 02:14:54.088]  I hope that answers your excellent question, John.
[02:14:54.088 --> 02:14:58.430]  And what about people that are handicapped?
[02:14:58.430 --> 02:14:59.831]  I mean, they are going to be in deep trouble.
[02:15:00.489 --> 02:15:06.272]  Well yeah, I get letters all the time from people who have sleep apnea, people who have chronic medical conditions.
[02:15:07.394 --> 02:15:09.817]  You need to plan ahead for all those.
[02:15:09.817 --> 02:15:12.039]  People who are diabetics, for example.
[02:15:12.039 --> 02:15:16.803]  I get the same questions over and over again from people who are diabetic, for example.
[02:15:16.803 --> 02:15:19.746]  It's like, well, how do I keep my insulin cold?
[02:15:19.746 --> 02:15:22.108]  Well, do you have photovoltaics?
[02:15:22.108 --> 02:15:26.813]  Or do you have a good old-fashioned Cervell propane-powered refrigerator?
[02:15:26.813 --> 02:15:32.058]  Or do you know how to go dig a 10-foot hole into the stone under your house to keep it cold in there?
[02:15:32.398 --> 02:15:33.459]  Right, yeah.
[02:15:33.459 --> 02:15:35.621]  People need to think these things through.
[02:15:35.621 --> 02:15:39.464]  If they have particular medical needs, they need to plan for them.
[02:15:39.464 --> 02:15:43.306]  I mean, even just people who wear prescription glasses need to plan ahead.
[02:15:43.306 --> 02:15:54.315]  And there's places like Zini Optical on the internet, I've linked to them on my website, where you can literally buy four pairs of glasses for $30.
[02:15:54.315 --> 02:16:02.041]  People need to think through their own particular needs for their own particular medical conditions, their own requirements, their own physical conditions.
[02:16:03.954 --> 02:16:10.298]  Yeah, just think about Katrina.
[02:16:10.298 --> 02:16:12.720]  The government can't and won't protect you.
[02:16:12.720 --> 02:16:18.164]  And if this country had ten Katrinas at once, and that's kind of what a depression's like, it's just going to degenerate.
[02:16:18.164 --> 02:16:19.785]  I mean, you had many of the police there.
[02:16:20.979 --> 02:16:23.561]  Robbing local stores, folks.
[02:16:23.561 --> 02:16:29.365]  So, in a lot of areas, obviously not like New Orleans, but, you know, heaven help us.
[02:16:29.365 --> 02:16:34.429]  Because the government is trying to recruit either low-grade morons or criminals right now.
[02:16:34.429 --> 02:16:36.370]  And it's a big threat.
[02:16:36.370 --> 02:16:39.092]  Houston, in Texas.
[02:16:39.092 --> 02:16:40.133]  That's kind of a pun.
[02:16:40.133 --> 02:16:42.094]  Welcome, Houston.
[02:16:42.094 --> 02:16:43.475]  Yes, I got a question for him.
[02:16:43.475 --> 02:16:49.800]  I'm down here trucking right now, and I was gonna see if he had any advice for us truckers out here.
[02:16:50.427 --> 02:16:58.730]  Well, in terms of planning ahead for fuel, I recommend that people buy the biggest propane tank they can find if they have any vehicles that are diesel engine.
[02:17:13.223 --> 02:17:14.844]  Put in a big diesel tank.
[02:17:14.844 --> 02:17:24.171]  There's really no point in putting in a huge gas tank for unleaded gasoline because it doesn't store more than three or four years, tops, even with a stabilizer.
[02:17:24.171 --> 02:17:28.855]  But if you've got the budget, stock up on propane because it stores indefinitely.
[02:17:28.855 --> 02:17:32.998]  Stock up on diesel fuel because it'll store for 10 plus years.
[02:17:32.998 --> 02:17:38.202]  You want to add an antimicrobial like Prid to it to make it store better.
[02:17:38.202 --> 02:17:41.945]  But fuel storage is crucial, especially for people who live
[02:17:42.754 --> 02:17:44.795]  Up in the northern states.
[02:17:44.795 --> 02:17:50.497]  If you don't have three or four cords of firewood stacked up, you're behind the power curve.
[02:17:50.497 --> 02:17:56.839]  You really need to... Yeah, good old-fashioned wood is the way to go, and if everything starts crumbling, it's going to be hard to get the wood.
[02:17:56.839 --> 02:17:58.360]  So you need to get it now.
[02:17:58.360 --> 02:18:07.803]  Yeah, and people need to think ahead in terms of having gasoline for their chainsaws and spare chains and gas stabilizer, and especially
[02:18:08.624 --> 02:18:12.067]  Two-stroke oil for mixing chainsaw gas.
[02:18:12.067 --> 02:18:12.748]  People will get this.
[02:18:12.748 --> 02:18:14.710]  That's gonna be like gold.
[02:18:14.710 --> 02:18:15.350]  Absolutely.
[02:18:15.350 --> 02:18:20.935]  People that are obsessed with guns get obsessed about other things that you need to survive.
[02:18:20.935 --> 02:18:28.943]  People should be just as obsessed about communications equipment, about first aid gear, about fuel storage, about gardening.
[02:18:28.943 --> 02:18:34.168]  They need to have that same level of interest because if you're only fixated on guns,
[02:18:35.161 --> 02:18:37.742]  Uh, you don't have a complete set of preparations.
[02:18:37.742 --> 02:18:45.566]  In fact, you're setting yourself up to be part of the problem, because if the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.
[02:18:45.566 --> 02:18:45.846]  Okay?
[02:18:45.846 --> 02:18:49.348]  And if you only have guns, you're going to end up being part of the problem.
[02:18:49.348 --> 02:18:56.751]  You're going to end up preying on your neighbors if you can't garden for your own food or raise your own livestock.
[02:18:56.751 --> 02:18:59.773]  Yeah, that's really a terrible thing, is what the studies that, I know the U.S.
[02:18:59.773 --> 02:19:02.014]  Army's done them, and other governments, groups have done them.
[02:19:02.014 --> 02:19:02.234]  What is it?
[02:19:02.813 --> 02:19:06.195]  Within seven days, most people without food become total criminals.
[02:19:06.195 --> 02:19:10.117]  Within 10 days, they start becoming just rampaging killers.
[02:19:10.117 --> 02:19:14.039]  And within 15, what is it, like 98% become cannibals?
[02:19:14.039 --> 02:19:15.540]  It could come down to that, yeah.
[02:19:15.540 --> 02:19:19.402]  That's one of the things I describe in my novel.
[02:19:19.402 --> 02:19:23.024]  Yeah, and then of course films like The Road.
[02:19:23.024 --> 02:19:30.628]  Unfortunately, if you really want to see human nature, The Road did a really good job of showing it at its real core.
[02:19:31.425 --> 02:19:38.607]  Because, you know, I'm a Christian, and I'm going to do my very best to act in a Christian manner and be charitable to others.
[02:19:38.607 --> 02:19:46.328]  But when you come right down to it, if you peel back all the layers of civilization, what's underneath is what you saw in the road.
[02:19:46.328 --> 02:19:47.929]  It's not very pretty underneath.
[02:19:47.929 --> 02:19:51.849]  Yeah, see, I wouldn't kill people for myself, but I probably would for my children.
[02:19:51.849 --> 02:19:54.070]  I'll be honest.
[02:19:54.070 --> 02:19:55.730]  I mean, I might start roasting people.
[02:19:55.730 --> 02:19:56.831]  I'm being sarcastic, folks.
[02:19:56.831 --> 02:19:57.611]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:57.611 --> 02:19:58.071]  Stay with us.

[02:22:29.910 --> 02:22:31.171]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:31.171 --> 02:22:35.734]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:35.734 --> 02:22:41.538]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:41.538 --> 02:22:45.180]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:45.180 --> 02:22:47.902]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:47.902 --> 02:22:52.965]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:22:52.965 --> 02:22:53.206]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:53.206 --> 02:22:54.607]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.370 --> 02:23:01.851]  Are you storing food?
[02:23:01.851 --> 02:23:07.993]  Prepared families are storing food for months and years, but only have enough fuel stored for days or weeks.
[02:23:07.993 --> 02:23:12.435]  Stretch your fuel storage by harnessing the power of the sun with the Sun Oven.
[02:23:12.435 --> 02:23:18.958]  Food can be baked, boiled, or steamed at temperatures of 360 to 400 degrees with the power of the sun.
[02:23:18.958 --> 02:23:21.879]  You can use the sun for 50 to 80 percent of your cooking.
[02:23:22.239 --> 02:23:25.320]  Allowing you to preserve your fuel storage for rainy days.
[02:23:25.320 --> 02:23:29.282]  Sun-baked foods stay moister and have less shrinkage and do not burn.
[02:23:29.282 --> 02:23:31.942]  Sun-baked roasts are tastier and more succulent.
[02:23:31.942 --> 02:23:35.324]  And sun-baked bread has unparalleled taste and texture.
[02:23:35.324 --> 02:23:39.465]  Water can be heated in a sun oven for purification or personal hygiene.
[02:23:39.465 --> 02:23:43.907]  For the past 26 years, sun ovens have been proudly made in the U.S.

[02:24:15.469 --> 02:24:20.676]  We're gonna have a totally jam-packed final 30 minutes here in the next segment.
[02:24:20.676 --> 02:24:29.307]  Mike Adams pops in for about 10 minutes, then I'm gonna premiere the footage they shot of the police telling them they couldn't go in the building there in Roswell, Georgia.
[02:24:30.549 --> 02:24:32.270]  And some other incredible news.
[02:24:32.270 --> 02:24:34.131]  So much of it we never even get to on the air.
[02:24:34.131 --> 02:24:37.833]  It's all at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:24:37.833 --> 02:24:49.079]  In fact, the featured news is coming in so fast, I'm going to add a link saying Top Stories at the top of the site so that all the articles we're writing and the research goes there so people start clicking on that.
[02:24:49.739 --> 02:24:52.301]  Another thing is Infowars.com forward slash feed.
[02:24:52.301 --> 02:24:53.662]  That's the RSS feed.
[02:24:53.662 --> 02:24:56.103]  That gets a lot of stuff that rolls off.
[02:24:56.103 --> 02:24:59.325]  We've just got to re-engineer the site because there's so much information up there.
[02:24:59.325 --> 02:25:04.809]  And so many times an incredible article just goes away.
[02:25:04.809 --> 02:25:12.013]  Mr. Rawls, we were talking during the break and you were discussing the IRA versus an American resistance and the difference is firearms.
[02:25:12.013 --> 02:25:13.214]  Briefly tell folks about that.
[02:25:13.214 --> 02:25:14.995]  Sure.
[02:25:14.995 --> 02:25:19.098]  As I mentioned, in the peace process in Northern Ireland,
[02:25:20.249 --> 02:25:28.295]  A few years back, it all came down to just a few hundred guns when they were trying to decommission the IRA units.
[02:25:28.295 --> 02:25:35.120]  We're talking two or three hundred guns was all that it took to hold up the peace process.
[02:25:35.120 --> 02:25:37.742]  Here, by contrast, in the United States, we have millions of guns.
[02:25:37.742 --> 02:25:44.426]  In fact, more than a million are being sold every month in the United States going into private hands.
[02:25:44.426 --> 02:25:47.328]  I've seen numbers of over five million guns sold per month.
[02:25:47.328 --> 02:25:49.330]  Yeah, it's a huge, huge number of guns.
[02:25:50.212 --> 02:25:53.953]  It's absolutely impossible to disarm the American people.
[02:25:53.953 --> 02:26:00.796]  And any globalist who has some fantasy of disarming the American people is absolutely deluded.
[02:26:00.796 --> 02:26:02.577]  It's never going to happen.
[02:26:02.577 --> 02:26:11.900]  Even if 95% or 98% of our population foolishly turned in their guns, there still would be more than enough guns to engage in a war of resistance.
[02:26:13.776 --> 02:26:22.564]  Well, let's say there's 200 million new guns in these last 20 years or so, but really it's more like 400 million, they estimate, good working guns out there.
[02:26:22.564 --> 02:26:23.244]  Right.
[02:26:23.244 --> 02:26:26.787]  And let's say there's 160 million gun owners, it's growing.
[02:26:26.787 --> 02:26:29.790]  Let's say 1% decides to fight.
[02:26:29.790 --> 02:26:34.474]  We're talking about, what is that, a million, 600,000 people?
[02:26:34.474 --> 02:26:36.496]  Yeah.
[02:26:36.496 --> 02:26:38.858]  And that's four times the size of our military.
[02:26:38.858 --> 02:26:41.540]  I mean, the numbers would be totally lopsided.
[02:26:42.535 --> 02:26:48.617]  And, for a guerrilla warfare situation, you don't even have to fight at a one-to-one ratio.
[02:26:48.617 --> 02:27:00.441]  So, there's absolutely no way that, and I describe this in my novel, Patriots, and in sequel, Survivors, there's no way that the American people could ever be disarmed.
[02:27:00.441 --> 02:27:07.303]  And even if there is an attempt to disarm them, they'll... I was about to say... There's no war that can't be won.
[02:27:07.303 --> 02:27:10.164]  It'll be a guerrilla war that
[02:27:11.894 --> 02:27:14.616]  There's only one logical conclusion.
[02:27:14.616 --> 02:27:15.957]  One inevitable conclusion.
[02:27:15.957 --> 02:27:20.321]  That is that our constitutional republic will be restored.
[02:27:20.321 --> 02:27:24.424]  Well, the enemy's using PSYOPS instead, but that's not working anymore.
[02:27:24.424 --> 02:27:36.053]  Congress has a 9% approval rating and I don't ever want it to go to this, but let's say they arrest Alex Jones, Disappear Me, you know it's a hardcore tyranny, all this just continues, they start trying to come and pick people up.
[02:27:36.793 --> 02:27:43.183]  If you've got 1%, and it's going to be way more than that, I think it'll probably be 10% of gun owners at some point will resist.
[02:27:43.183 --> 02:27:50.353]  But if 1%, 1,600,000 went out and simply went after one bad guy, and then never were seen again.
[02:27:51.329 --> 02:27:52.049]  You know, boom!
[02:27:52.049 --> 02:27:55.251]  Talk about Mark Corny, he uses the moose hunting license.
[02:27:55.251 --> 02:27:59.914]  You have to get in a lottery just to maybe get the moose hunting license.
[02:27:59.914 --> 02:28:03.656]  It's not like... My point is, they always say, oh, the military, all these weapons.
[02:28:03.656 --> 02:28:07.398]  Most of the military I talk to are awakened on our side more than the general public.
[02:28:07.398 --> 02:28:10.280]  And so this idea of, oh, we can't fight the government if it comes to that.
[02:28:10.760 --> 02:28:15.604]  I don't want that, because the globalists will sit offshore and let the Civil War drag on.
[02:28:15.604 --> 02:28:20.768]  I would rather, with the truth, psy-op them and get them to join reality.
[02:28:20.768 --> 02:28:31.495]  But if the system goes to some Soviet-Russia type deal, this is not going to be like the NKVD and nobody would stand up to them, and Alexander Shultz needs to bemoan that.
[02:28:31.495 --> 02:28:35.318]  Yes, we have a different situation here in the States.
[02:28:35.318 --> 02:28:39.401]  Again, if a guerrilla war situation ever develops,
[02:28:41.630 --> 02:28:47.112]  God help anyone who tries to enforce tyranny on the United States.
[02:28:47.112 --> 02:28:49.953]  It won't last long.
[02:28:49.953 --> 02:28:51.954]  Yeah, the system's set up all the tyranny now.
[02:28:51.954 --> 02:28:53.494]  They're just not fully implementing.
[02:28:53.494 --> 02:28:56.115]  They're kind of like waiting at the edge of a cliff.
[02:28:56.115 --> 02:29:01.617]  Yeah, the bureaucratic approach, the incremental approach, seems to have been working for them.
[02:29:01.617 --> 02:29:07.099]  But if they try to implement anything in a hurry, there'll be a huge backlash.
[02:29:07.099 --> 02:29:08.019]  But that's the issue.
[02:29:08.019 --> 02:29:11.040]  Even the incremental at a certain point hits a flashpoint, and it's coming to that.
[02:29:11.843 --> 02:29:14.227]  I think we are approaching it, yes.
[02:29:14.227 --> 02:29:21.118]  Well, I'll be praying for all your listeners, Alex, that they put themselves in the right place at the right time with the right people.
[02:29:21.118 --> 02:29:23.322]  Yeah, we didn't even get to many of the calls.
[02:29:23.322 --> 02:29:26.146]  Promise us in the next month or so you'll come back and just take calls.
[02:29:27.602 --> 02:29:28.162]  I'll be happy to.
[02:29:28.162 --> 02:29:29.303]  Let me say bye to you in the break.
[02:29:29.303 --> 02:29:32.605]  Folks, get his book at InfoWars.com or at bookstores everywhere.
[02:29:32.605 --> 02:29:35.546]  Survivor is a novel of the coming collapse.
[02:29:35.546 --> 02:29:37.948]  Great to give this to friends and family to get them thinking.
[02:29:37.948 --> 02:29:40.769]  Available at InfoWars.com or SurvivalBlog.com.
[02:29:40.769 --> 02:29:50.294]  We'll be right back with Mike Adams and more.
[02:29:50.294 --> 02:29:51.695]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.695 --> 02:29:54.216]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.216 --> 02:29:56.898]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.069 --> 02:30:05.611]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:05.611 --> 02:30:06.532]  Number one.
[02:30:06.532 --> 02:30:09.954]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:09.954 --> 02:30:10.814]  Number two.
[02:30:10.814 --> 02:30:15.697]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:15.697 --> 02:30:16.437]  It's true.
[02:30:16.437 --> 02:30:21.000]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:21.300 --> 02:30:22.121]  Number 3.
[02:30:22.121 --> 02:30:25.724]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:25.724 --> 02:30:29.648]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:29.648 --> 02:30:30.428]  Number 4.
[02:30:30.428 --> 02:30:33.191]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:33.191 --> 02:30:36.534]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:36.854 --> 02:30:41.799]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:41.799 --> 02:30:46.864]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:46.864 --> 02:30:51.048]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:51.048 --> 02:30:52.829]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:52.829 --> 02:30:57.434]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:31:00.817 --> 02:31:04.638]  Right now, the average family spends one-fourth of their income on food.
[02:31:04.638 --> 02:31:10.560]  It's time to cut your food budget in half by using the best, most affordable food on the planet from eFoodsDirect.
[02:31:10.560 --> 02:31:14.082]  The savings from eating this food will actually help you pay your other bills.

[02:31:22.045 --> 02:31:28.787]  This food is compact, making it easy to store some away and will be just as delicious in 25 years as the ones you cook tonight.
[02:31:29.127 --> 02:31:30.187]  Is it affordable?
[02:31:30.187 --> 02:31:31.128]  Absolutely!
[02:31:31.128 --> 02:31:36.350]  The new Alex Jones Family Pack saves you up to 50% compared to other food storage companies.
[02:31:36.350 --> 02:31:42.833]  See the comparison at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex or call 800-409-5633.
[02:31:42.833 --> 02:31:47.775]  My friends, as crazy as this world is today, you'd be nuts to not get a storable food supply.
[02:31:47.775 --> 02:31:52.657]  Give eFoodsDirect a call and order one of the Alex Jones Family Packs and test it out today.
[02:31:52.657 --> 02:31:54.638]  Start your journey of food independence today.
[02:31:55.178 --> 02:32:03.480]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:32:03.480 --> 02:32:08.782]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:32:08.782 --> 02:32:10.322]  Saving means to make money.
[02:32:10.322 --> 02:32:19.105]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:32:19.845 --> 02:32:27.392]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:32:27.392 --> 02:32:35.400]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:32:35.400 --> 02:32:40.625]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[02:32:40.625 --> 02:32:42.787]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:32:45.509 --> 02:32:51.593]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:32:51.593 --> 02:32:53.515]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:45.888 --> 02:33:47.449]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:33:47.449 --> 02:33:48.129]  to 2 p.m.
[02:33:48.129 --> 02:33:51.011]  Central, we are here.
[02:33:51.011 --> 02:33:55.873]  Back weeknights, of course, with InfoWars Nightly News, 7 o'clock every evening.
[02:33:55.873 --> 02:34:03.497]  I'm going to have some special reports tonight, and Aaron Dykes is also going to be on the show, and we have some of the Oklahoma City investigators there with April.
[02:34:05.222 --> 02:34:12.529]  Nineteenth coming up, the date of the United Nations globalist bombing, so they could demonize the American people.
[02:34:12.529 --> 02:34:15.572]  Just a brief interview now, breaking news at naturalnews.com.
[02:34:15.572 --> 02:34:18.354]  It's also one of the top stories at infowars.com.
[02:34:21.636 --> 02:34:30.699]  And that is, Michigan government unleashes armed raids on small pig farmers, forces farmer to shoot all his own pigs, saying they're an invasive species.
[02:34:30.699 --> 02:34:38.702]  And they wrote it where they said black hair, brown hair, red hair, or any other trait they say can be connected to being feral, they kill them.
[02:34:38.702 --> 02:34:41.923]  Well, all pigs, if they get out over time, grow longer hair and tusks.
[02:34:41.923 --> 02:34:42.783]  It's all the same thing.
[02:34:44.369 --> 02:34:49.113]  And this is a new way to shut down small farms and ranches and the UN said they'll do this.
[02:34:49.113 --> 02:34:51.676]  They're saying dogs and cats are invasive.
[02:34:52.695 --> 02:34:54.636]  So, without warrants they did this.
[02:34:54.636 --> 02:34:55.276]  It's amazing.
[02:34:55.276 --> 02:35:00.698]  Joining us from his evil farm is Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[02:35:00.698 --> 02:35:09.741]  Mike, we were conspiracy theorists saying the law read they were going to send armed people out without warrants and kill pigs and arrest people, but it's now beginning.
[02:35:09.741 --> 02:35:15.543]  Instead of stopping the feral pigs that have been out there for a hundred years, they're saying pigs and pens are bad.
[02:35:15.543 --> 02:35:18.985]  Government uses any crisis for a power grab.
[02:35:18.985 --> 02:35:19.485]  Mike Adams.
[02:35:20.365 --> 02:35:24.388]  Yeah, one week ago, Alex, we had Mark Baker on your show.
[02:35:24.388 --> 02:35:28.151]  He was one of the featured guests, and he described what was happening there in Michigan.
[02:35:28.151 --> 02:35:30.192]  And I remember seeing some of the comments.
[02:35:30.192 --> 02:35:31.773]  People said, oh, this can't be true.
[02:35:31.773 --> 02:35:32.974]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[02:35:32.974 --> 02:35:39.939]  Well, as it has happened in the last couple of days, just over the weekend, the DNR, that's the Department of Natural Resources in Michigan,
[02:35:40.339 --> 02:35:40.539]  Yes.
[02:36:03.786 --> 02:36:04.567]  We're good to go.
[02:36:22.304 --> 02:36:27.287]  So what we have now, Alex, let me give you the names and the facts of this case in Kalkaska County.
[02:36:27.287 --> 02:36:30.609]  One raid conducted at Fife Lake is the town name.
[02:36:30.609 --> 02:36:32.650]  The rancher there is Dave Tuxbury.
[02:36:32.650 --> 02:36:35.772]  Another raid in Sheboygan County at Renegade Ranch.
[02:36:35.772 --> 02:36:40.394]  Ron McKendrick was the victim, farmer targeted there by the DNR.
[02:36:40.394 --> 02:36:42.756]  He is going to appear in court this Friday.
[02:36:42.756 --> 02:36:44.717]  There's a hearing in Sheboygan County.
[02:36:44.717 --> 02:36:48.139]  And all those listening who can attend and help support this are invited to come there.
[02:36:48.139 --> 02:36:48.879]  At 9 a.m.
[02:36:48.879 --> 02:36:50.100]  there's going to be a court hearing.
[02:36:51.027 --> 02:37:01.252]  And he's going to present a legal strategy to try to fight back against this total outrageous tyranny, something that I'm calling domestic terrorism by Michigan government thugs.
[02:37:01.252 --> 02:37:02.833]  These people need to be arrested, Alex.
[02:37:02.833 --> 02:37:04.594]  That's what's happening in Michigan today.
[02:37:04.594 --> 02:37:05.074]  That's right.
[02:37:05.074 --> 02:37:06.134]  And that's what they said in the law.
[02:37:06.134 --> 02:37:11.797]  They said felony charges, arrest, huge fines, and we'll come in without warrants and kill them.
[02:37:11.797 --> 02:37:13.878]  So instead, they just said, we're going to be nice.
[02:37:13.878 --> 02:37:16.239]  Kill your pigs and we won't arrest you.
[02:37:16.239 --> 02:37:16.680]  And again,
[02:37:17.700 --> 02:37:20.021]  I read the law on air weeks ago.
[02:37:20.021 --> 02:37:26.244]  It said any characteristic that we say, even if it's not recognized as quote being feral.
[02:37:26.244 --> 02:37:29.686]  And they say black spots, brown hair, red hair.
[02:37:29.686 --> 02:37:32.928]  I mean, there are hundreds of breeds of pig that look like that.
[02:37:32.928 --> 02:37:33.468]  You see them?
[02:37:33.468 --> 02:37:37.230]  I took my kids to the livestock show that were pigs with black hair, pigs with red hair.
[02:37:38.030 --> 02:37:47.156]  And of course, these wild pigs get out, breed, but it's not the people who have pigs that they say might have characteristics of a feral hog that are causing the problem.
[02:37:47.156 --> 02:37:56.682]  I mean, this is so amazing how there is a feral hog problem across the country, but instead of saying, hey folks, you see feral hogs kill them, having a public service announcement,
[02:37:57.202 --> 02:38:00.503]  Instead, they just say it makes you a crime.
[02:38:00.503 --> 02:38:09.866]  They can't find enough folks to bust for illegal drugs the government ships in, so now it's your invasive pig, or it's your animal ID, your premises ID.
[02:38:09.866 --> 02:38:13.667]  But remember, Mike, we were wrong to warn of this, but now it's happening.
[02:38:13.667 --> 02:38:14.748]  It's absolutely happening.
[02:38:14.748 --> 02:38:18.809]  Remember, a feral pig is merely a pig outside the fence.
[02:38:19.349 --> 02:38:21.010]  So these pigs were inside the fence.
[02:38:21.010 --> 02:38:21.951]  They were domesticated.
[02:38:21.951 --> 02:38:22.691]  They were livestock.
[02:38:22.691 --> 02:38:25.573]  They've been raised year after year for a long time.
[02:38:25.573 --> 02:38:29.036]  So now we have the state of Michigan criminalizing livestock.
[02:38:29.036 --> 02:38:36.841]  They are a gang of unindicted criminals running loose with guns across the state of Michigan, forcing farmers to murder their own livestock.
[02:38:36.841 --> 02:38:39.262]  And there's no indication that they're only going to stop with pigs.
[02:38:39.262 --> 02:38:43.125]  They could do this with birds, with chickens, with certain types of cows, with goats.
[02:38:43.125 --> 02:38:47.628]  They could just add to their list and go around murdering, just slaughtering animals all across the state.
[02:38:47.848 --> 02:38:50.351]  Let me explain this to people who don't understand farming.
[02:38:50.351 --> 02:39:00.565]  The beautiful Texas Longhorn is really a 3,000 year old, I think it goes back even before the Romans, but at least 2,000 year old Roman breed
[02:39:03.608 --> 02:39:08.269]  of cow, bovine, that was then brought into Spain by the Romans.
[02:39:08.269 --> 02:39:12.591]  The Spanish then, 500 years ago, just like horses, brought them in.
[02:39:12.591 --> 02:39:17.372]  They went wild like Mustang horses that are identical to, you know, regular breed of horses.
[02:39:17.372 --> 02:39:21.733]  You can capture them, domesticate them, breed them, make great workhorses, some of the best.
[02:39:21.733 --> 02:39:24.874]  You know, great range horses for riding fence.
[02:39:24.874 --> 02:39:28.575]  That is called an invasive species because it's a feral cow.
[02:39:29.215 --> 02:39:33.979]  They're actually pretty well behaved and a good breed to have, very handsome as well.
[02:39:33.979 --> 02:39:41.385]  The point is, and they can live on scrub brush, a very hardy cow, it's a Spanish cow, but it even goes back to the Romans, like the bull mastiff dog.
[02:39:42.358 --> 02:39:56.728]  They take pigs that were domesticated, they get out, they're wild, and now they're saying, if your pigs look like what wild pigs look like, we're gonna kill them, and then the guy who goes on your show, my show, when you were sitting in, they raid him, they picked him as an example!
[02:39:56.728 --> 02:39:58.609]  That's the breaking news here, Mike!
[02:39:58.609 --> 02:40:05.374]  No, correction there, they avoided him, they raided other farmers who they saw as more vulnerable who weren't speaking out.
[02:40:05.374 --> 02:40:07.555]  I was confused then, I thought you were saying it was the same guy.
[02:40:07.555 --> 02:40:08.856]  Oh, he was the guy warning about it.
[02:40:09.156 --> 02:40:10.157]  Right, I may have misspoke.
[02:40:10.157 --> 02:40:22.064]  Mark Baker at bakersgreenacres.com, he was left alone because he said we're waiting for you and he went public and he filmed the video with his family and the farm and everything so the DNR wouldn't touch him.
[02:40:22.064 --> 02:40:27.587]  Instead they went after other friends in the industry who are also raising pigs who they saw as defenseless.
[02:40:29.048 --> 02:40:36.991]  Another legal tactic that they used, Alex, is the state DNR officials could not get a warrant in the counties where the farms existed.
[02:40:36.991 --> 02:40:53.918]  So they got warrants in other counties, and then used that as an unconstitutional justification to come in and trespass on their property, to violate their Fourth Amendment rights, and then force them to make sure that they slaughtered their own pigs in order to avoid being arrested as felons.
[02:40:53.918 --> 02:40:56.279]  This is outrageous, Alex.
[02:40:56.279 --> 02:40:57.160]  This is the end
[02:40:57.980 --> 02:41:01.123]  of basic fundamental farming freedom in Michigan.
[02:41:01.123 --> 02:41:05.126]  We've got to stand up to this, and that's why I've called for the public arrest of these DNR officials.
[02:41:05.126 --> 02:41:08.949]  We've got to have a citizen's posse out there arresting these tyrants.
[02:41:08.949 --> 02:41:13.372]  Well, bottom line, now, we've got our East Texas property.
[02:41:13.372 --> 02:41:26.042]  We leased it out for some deer hunting, and in my dad's entire life, he's never seen federally funded task forces of game wardens spilling onto our property and being very bossy.
[02:41:27.183 --> 02:41:33.750]  Uh, and and now you're taking a deer in to get it processed.
[02:41:33.750 --> 02:41:38.815]  State police pull you over, scream at you like you're a criminal, even though you've got the tags and everything.
[02:41:38.815 --> 02:41:40.817]  They're looking for people to throw in prison.
[02:41:40.817 --> 02:41:43.080]  We've got the biggest prison population out there.
[02:41:43.080 --> 02:41:49.927]  So now they're going to say that all these small pig farms are invasive and they say any pig we want
[02:41:50.327 --> 02:41:52.368]  We can say has characteristics.
[02:41:52.368 --> 02:41:54.449]  It says they can say whatever they want.
[02:41:54.449 --> 02:41:55.450]  And who's funding this?
[02:41:55.450 --> 02:41:58.852]  Big Agro wants the small chicken producers shut down on record.
[02:41:58.852 --> 02:41:59.873]  They're financing that.
[02:41:59.873 --> 02:42:02.054]  They want small beef production shut down.
[02:42:02.054 --> 02:42:10.879]  I was just talking about it with our guest earlier, how they're saying people can't do veterinary work on their own animals now, which is standard for those that don't know.
[02:42:10.879 --> 02:42:12.340]  It's all Agenda 21.
[02:42:14.221 --> 02:42:15.883]  And that's what's happening here.
[02:42:15.883 --> 02:42:24.613]  They say in agenda 21, all farm animals are invasive and they want to abolish the practice of eating meat and are brainwashing school children right now.
[02:42:24.613 --> 02:42:25.974]  It's all happening.
[02:42:25.974 --> 02:42:27.276]  It's part of the takeover.
[02:42:27.276 --> 02:42:28.898]  They've done it in Europe in many areas.
[02:42:29.258 --> 02:42:38.607]  We have got to resist this legally and lawfully, Alex, in great contrast to the new Black Panthers who are calling for shooting Whitey and so on.
[02:42:38.607 --> 02:42:45.493]  What we are calling for, at least what I'm calling for, is the legal, lawful, armed citizens arrest of these
[02:42:46.714 --> 02:42:58.084]  Renegade government tyrants who are slaughtering the livestock of farmers who are operating under complete compliance with USDA regulations and even existing Michigan regulations for farming.
[02:42:58.084 --> 02:42:59.565]  They're not doing anything illegal.
[02:42:59.565 --> 02:43:05.530]  You'd think they were running drugs or cooking meth or something by the way they're rated at gunpoint, but no, they're just raising livestock.
[02:43:05.530 --> 02:43:06.291]  Alex, this is insane.
[02:43:06.291 --> 02:43:09.994]  If we don't stop Michigan now, what else are they going to come up with?
[02:43:09.994 --> 02:43:10.655]  Where does this end?
[02:43:12.543 --> 02:43:16.726]  Mike, we're going to have to get an update from you tomorrow here on the radio, maybe even the nightly news tonight.
[02:43:16.726 --> 02:43:17.927]  This is just incredible.
[02:43:17.927 --> 02:43:20.910]  But again, people said, oh, you're misinterpreting that.
[02:43:20.910 --> 02:43:21.991]  That's not going to happen.
[02:43:21.991 --> 02:43:26.734]  They'll never have an IRS checkpoint to not let you travel if you hadn't paid the quote tax.
[02:43:26.734 --> 02:43:28.676]  Now it's passed the Senate and the House.
[02:43:28.676 --> 02:43:31.618]  They'd never secretly arrest Americans and kill us.
[02:43:31.618 --> 02:43:32.419]  Now law.
[02:43:32.419 --> 02:43:34.561]  They'd never spawn us without warrants.
[02:43:34.561 --> 02:43:35.601]  Now law.
[02:43:35.601 --> 02:43:37.123]  I mean, there is no doubt
[02:43:37.623 --> 02:43:40.884]  That they have sent out swarms of agents to eat out our substance.
[02:43:40.884 --> 02:43:43.545]  Mike Adams, thank you for breaking this information.
[02:43:43.545 --> 02:43:44.105]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:43:44.105 --> 02:43:47.407]  Great to join you today, and a great guest you had on earlier with James Wesley Rawls.
[02:43:47.407 --> 02:43:48.007]  Awesome guy.
[02:43:48.007 --> 02:43:48.407]  Thank you.
[02:43:48.407 --> 02:43:50.708]  Well, so many great people out there fighting this tyranny.
[02:43:50.708 --> 02:43:52.028]  We're going to do it together.
[02:43:52.028 --> 02:43:53.949]  Okay, I want to go to this report.
[02:43:53.949 --> 02:44:01.852]  People kept saying, show us the video of the police saying you can't film in Georgia.
[02:44:01.852 --> 02:44:02.432]  They're in
[02:44:04.164 --> 02:44:10.248]  The town where the man had the chickens and the agenda 21 zoning said it was going to be a green space.
[02:44:10.248 --> 02:44:11.489]  He kept beating him in court.
[02:44:11.489 --> 02:44:16.053]  They said he couldn't have chickens, so his chickens all got poisoned and then suddenly his house blew up.
[02:44:16.053 --> 02:44:27.261]  We went to Roswell, Georgia, Darren McBrain and Marcos Morales, our reporters, to investigate this and the police pull up in front of the big old city hall building and get in their face and tell them they can't go inside.
[02:44:28.174 --> 02:44:31.499]  And then they watch other people go inside and take photos and stuff.
[02:44:31.499 --> 02:44:37.687]  So here is part of that report with Darren McBreen and Marcos Morales from Georgia.
[02:44:37.687 --> 02:44:40.771]  The proof that the police did this like it was North Korea.
[02:44:40.771 --> 02:44:41.151]  Here it is.
[02:44:44.315 --> 02:44:45.936]  I'm not recording him.
[02:44:45.936 --> 02:44:47.856]  I have no reason to record you.
[02:44:47.856 --> 02:44:52.338]  So, in order to talk to them, do we have to write something first or I don't understand?
[02:44:52.338 --> 02:44:56.060]  We're with KLBJ and Free Speech Systems.
[02:44:56.060 --> 02:45:00.101]  Give me a card, show me your credentials, and I'll run it up the pole for you.
[02:45:13.300 --> 02:45:15.242]  I've got two 54s here.
[02:45:15.242 --> 02:45:17.044]  Claim they're with the news media.
[02:45:17.044 --> 02:45:19.185]  Reluctant to show me any ID.
[02:45:19.185 --> 02:45:19.566]  No, no, no.
[02:45:19.566 --> 02:45:20.286]  Not reluctant.
[02:45:20.286 --> 02:45:24.150]  He's going to get it.
[02:45:24.150 --> 02:45:26.592]  I said reluctant.
[02:45:26.592 --> 02:45:29.555]  Not reluctant.
[02:45:29.555 --> 02:45:30.415]  I said reluctant.
[02:45:30.415 --> 02:45:31.737]  And I'm correcting you.
[02:45:31.737 --> 02:45:33.238]  No, you're not correcting me, sir.
[02:45:33.238 --> 02:45:34.019]  I'm correcting you.
[02:45:34.019 --> 02:45:35.180]  I'm correcting the situation.
[02:45:36.884 --> 02:45:38.846]  Turn the camera off, okay?
[02:45:38.846 --> 02:45:41.089]  I have no legal obligation to do so.
[02:45:41.089 --> 02:45:44.092]  I'm documenting this case in particular.
[02:45:44.092 --> 02:45:49.319]  Public servants performing a public service.
[02:45:49.319 --> 02:45:50.240]  Watch him over there.
[02:45:58.220 --> 02:46:00.022]  You're the one carrying the camera.
[02:46:00.022 --> 02:46:01.064]  I'm just the cameraman.
[02:46:01.064 --> 02:46:03.107]  I just need to see your ID, sir.
[02:46:03.107 --> 02:46:04.609]  My identification?
[02:46:04.609 --> 02:46:05.410]  Yes.
[02:46:05.410 --> 02:46:06.471]  Well, I'm going to face this way.
[02:46:08.952 --> 02:46:11.213]  I'm not infringing on any property rights.
[02:46:11.213 --> 02:46:13.014]  You're bringing a camera onto the property.
[02:46:13.014 --> 02:46:14.295]  You do not know who you are.
[02:46:14.295 --> 02:46:16.736]  I need your ID, please.
[02:46:16.736 --> 02:46:18.637]  On what basis, though, sir?
[02:46:18.637 --> 02:46:23.880]  If you need my press pass to show that we're pressed, this guy is the press and I am his cameraman.
[02:46:23.880 --> 02:46:26.201]  Could you stand in front of the jeep, please?
[02:46:26.201 --> 02:46:28.862]  I want to be over here where I can talk to you.
[02:46:28.862 --> 02:46:29.883]  Alright.
[02:46:29.883 --> 02:46:31.043]  One, two, three.
[02:46:35.201 --> 02:46:41.586]  Three cop cars flying on public property.
[02:46:41.586 --> 02:46:45.830]  There's a spokesperson, Marcos, that you talked to?
[02:46:45.830 --> 02:46:47.071]  Yeah, media relations.
[02:46:47.071 --> 02:46:50.173]  So I said, well, let me go talk to her and I'll just ask her a few questions.
[02:46:50.173 --> 02:46:56.238]  And then this gentleman... Yeah, he just went up to talk with Julie Bregman.
[02:46:56.238 --> 02:46:58.079]  I told you to quit filming me.
[02:46:58.079 --> 02:47:01.462]  This is a public servant on public property in a public place.
[02:47:02.890 --> 02:47:03.611]  And we are media.
[02:47:03.611 --> 02:47:04.611]  How are you doing?
[02:47:04.611 --> 02:47:06.312]  Good, how are you doing?
[02:47:06.312 --> 02:47:07.593]  We're not trying to be resistant.
[02:47:07.593 --> 02:47:09.414]  We're not trying to be... I understand.
[02:47:09.414 --> 02:47:11.576]  We're just doing our job that we've been sent on here to do.
[02:47:11.576 --> 02:47:14.718]  Did he ID as well as he did?
[02:47:14.718 --> 02:47:15.158]  No, sir.
[02:47:15.158 --> 02:47:15.439]  No, sir.
[02:47:15.439 --> 02:47:16.259]  You asked for a press pass.
[02:47:16.259 --> 02:47:17.820]  I didn't come back and get it.
[02:47:17.820 --> 02:47:20.282]  You asked me for a press pass, not ID.
[02:47:20.282 --> 02:47:24.365]  And we aren't breaking any laws.
[02:47:24.365 --> 02:47:25.986]  I didn't say you were breaking laws.
[02:47:25.986 --> 02:47:28.267]  I said we have policies regarding cameras.
[02:47:30.031 --> 02:47:32.233]  Yeah, we don't log without a permit.
[02:47:32.233 --> 02:47:34.014]  I don't know that you were with the press.
[02:47:34.014 --> 02:47:35.855]  I told him to turn his camera off.
[02:47:35.855 --> 02:47:36.896]  But the credentials are there.
[02:47:36.896 --> 02:47:39.357]  A permit for a camera in America!
[02:47:39.357 --> 02:47:41.719]  Here's what I can tell you to do, okay?
[02:47:41.719 --> 02:47:44.341]  What I would do is contact you directly.
[02:47:44.341 --> 02:47:45.882]  And that's the person he talked to?
[02:47:45.882 --> 02:47:47.823]  I have no idea who you're talking about.
[02:47:47.823 --> 02:47:49.264]  Man, I just tried to watch it and see.
[02:47:49.264 --> 02:47:51.245]  All I didn't know would be a great search of fun.
[02:47:54.841 --> 02:47:55.622]  That's why we're here.
[02:47:55.622 --> 02:47:58.224]  We're here to figure all these facts out.
[02:47:58.224 --> 02:48:03.389]  Well, if we would have said that to begin with, then I could have referred you to the right place.
[02:48:03.389 --> 02:48:06.892]  But I believe you talked with Julie and she sent you away.
[02:48:06.892 --> 02:48:08.574]  She didn't send me away.
[02:48:08.574 --> 02:48:10.215]  She didn't tell me to leave.
[02:48:10.215 --> 02:48:13.418]  She didn't express any interest in me not being here.
[02:48:13.418 --> 02:48:15.961]  Did you not ask her if City Council was here?
[02:48:15.961 --> 02:48:17.062]  That's exactly what I did.
[02:48:17.062 --> 02:48:18.082]  And what did she say?
[02:48:18.082 --> 02:48:18.583]  She said they were
[02:48:19.543 --> 02:48:20.824]  They're not here.
[02:48:20.824 --> 02:48:25.105]  So I said, okay, let me go out and in my, I didn't tell her where I was going.
[02:48:25.105 --> 02:48:26.505]  She didn't tell me to leave.
[02:48:26.505 --> 02:48:31.806]  In my head, I decided I'm going to go out and confer with my reporter to figure out the next move.
[02:48:31.806 --> 02:48:36.688]  And in doing so, we decided we should go back in there and ask her if she wouldn't mind us shooting some footage.
[02:48:37.708 --> 02:48:43.130]  You know, another thing I'm curious about, like you said, we had to be authorized media, but why wouldn't a person with a video camera?
[02:48:43.130 --> 02:48:44.931]  Like, I'm from Austin, Texas.
[02:48:44.931 --> 02:48:47.192]  We have a huge city hall.
[02:48:47.192 --> 02:48:51.754]  And we could walk in with cameras and just, hey, how you doing, sir?
[02:48:51.754 --> 02:48:55.395]  And talk to people up the stairs, inside the building.
[02:48:55.395 --> 02:48:59.277]  So imagine our surprise when we're just blocked right away.
[02:48:59.277 --> 02:49:00.677]  What are you doing with those cameras?
[02:49:00.677 --> 02:49:01.618]  It's just kind of odd to me.
[02:49:03.373 --> 02:49:04.595]  Can't answer that, sir.
[02:49:04.595 --> 02:49:06.337]  And I'll be honest with you.
[02:49:06.337 --> 02:49:10.384]  Are we allowed to videotape the building, for example, for like a B-roll or something?
[02:49:10.384 --> 02:49:13.749]  I mean, is this privately owned property?
[02:49:13.749 --> 02:49:18.055]  In Georgia, really, there's no publicly owned property.
[02:49:18.055 --> 02:49:19.257]  Everybody owns something.
[02:49:20.421 --> 02:49:25.806]  Okay, so you wouldn't be comfortable with us videotaping the building?
[02:49:41.343 --> 02:49:41.944]  Hey, pause.
[02:49:41.944 --> 02:49:44.206]  I'm not comfortable with you videotaping the building.
[02:49:44.206 --> 02:49:46.488]  And in Georgia, there's really no public property, boy.
[02:49:46.488 --> 02:49:52.793]  This is where boss hogs from and Roscoe Pico train.
[02:49:52.793 --> 02:50:01.020]  We're just here to investigate the guy that had chickens in his house blew up and it says the UN agenda 21 was taking it for green zone right here in the city council.
[02:50:01.020 --> 02:50:03.062]  We'd like to go on the city council, talk to people.
[02:50:03.062 --> 02:50:05.825]  No, sir, you're not going to do that, boy.
[02:50:07.878 --> 02:50:09.379]  Back it up to where he was saying that.
[02:50:09.379 --> 02:50:11.641]  Well, we're running out of time.
[02:50:11.641 --> 02:50:14.603]  Well, I'm going to air this again tonight on the Nightly News, okay?
[02:50:14.603 --> 02:50:15.523]  We're going to come back.
[02:50:15.523 --> 02:50:17.384]  We'll play the end of this and the rest of it.
[02:50:17.384 --> 02:50:20.006]  And then they tell him, you can't go in the building.
[02:50:20.006 --> 02:50:21.227]  And Marcos is so polite.
[02:50:21.227 --> 02:50:23.949]  You know, he went in there and he's like, is it this big building or that one?
[02:50:23.949 --> 02:50:24.369]  City Council.
[02:50:24.369 --> 02:50:25.750]  He's like, who are you?
[02:50:25.750 --> 02:50:27.271]  He's like, oh, I'm just with the press here to cover.
[02:50:27.271 --> 02:50:31.234]  She goes, okay, well, no, it's that building right there, which by the way, he was in the right one.
[02:50:32.248 --> 02:50:34.729]  And he comes back out, goes, come on, Darren.
[02:50:34.729 --> 02:50:38.131]  All of a sudden, three cop guards zoom up.
[02:50:38.131 --> 02:50:39.631]  Turn that camera off!
[02:50:39.631 --> 02:50:41.232]  What do you think this is, America?
[02:50:41.232 --> 02:50:45.314]  We don't allow cameras in North Korea!
[02:50:45.314 --> 02:50:49.776]  Hey, do you mind if we videotape just the front of the building?
[02:50:49.776 --> 02:50:56.559]  I don't know if I'm comfortable with that.
[02:50:56.559 --> 02:50:57.439]  I shouldn't be laughing.
[02:50:57.439 --> 02:50:58.140]  I should be crying.
[02:50:58.140 --> 02:51:00.181]  This country's in deep trouble.
[02:51:00.181 --> 02:51:00.561]  Oh, boy.

[02:51:40.217 --> 02:51:40.998]  This capitalism?
[02:51:40.998 --> 02:51:47.282]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[02:53:50.738 --> 02:53:53.480]  By the way, the Dukes of Hazzard is based in Georgia.
[02:53:53.480 --> 02:53:55.222]  We don't allow no cameras around here, boy!
[02:53:55.222 --> 02:53:57.403]  Get your chicken man dad, now get out of town!
[02:54:17.622 --> 02:54:18.883]  I mean, I shouldn't laugh about it.
[02:54:18.883 --> 02:54:22.045]  And by the way, they didn't have their cameras rolling at first.
[02:54:22.045 --> 02:54:22.945]  Because they had to get them on.
[02:54:22.945 --> 02:54:24.927]  Three cop cars zoom up.
[02:54:24.927 --> 02:54:28.069]  They jump out.
[02:54:28.069 --> 02:54:31.771]  Talk about the wicked fleeth when none pursue.
[02:54:31.771 --> 02:54:33.392]  And again, this is the new America.
[02:54:33.392 --> 02:54:36.294]  And my wife went to church and it was like, worship the police.
[02:54:36.294 --> 02:54:37.215]  Do whatever they say.
[02:54:37.215 --> 02:54:38.736]  I'm not doing what they say if it's illegal.
[02:54:42.427 --> 02:54:44.709]  We all know the police in North Korea are bad.
[02:54:44.709 --> 02:54:46.249]  We don't want our police to turn into that.
[02:54:46.249 --> 02:54:48.170]  And when you let them act like this, they do.
[02:54:48.170 --> 02:54:49.631]  Let's finish up this part of the clip.
[02:54:49.631 --> 02:54:52.653]  Go ahead.
[02:54:52.653 --> 02:54:56.654]  Are we allowed to videotape the building, for example, for like a B-roll or something?
[02:54:56.654 --> 02:54:59.336]  I mean, is this privately owned property?
[02:54:59.336 --> 02:55:04.358]  In Georgia, really, there's no publicly owned property.
[02:55:04.358 --> 02:55:05.539]  Everybody owns something.
[02:55:06.520 --> 02:55:12.044]  That's up to him.
[02:55:12.044 --> 02:55:14.626]  He's a City Hall officer.
[02:55:14.626 --> 02:55:20.290]  He's more familiar with what they allow at City Hall than I am.
[02:55:20.290 --> 02:55:21.631]  Sure, sure.
[02:55:21.631 --> 02:55:27.515]  If he tells you, if he asks you not to, then... Okay, so you wouldn't be comfortable with us videotaping the building?
[02:55:27.515 --> 02:55:31.978]  I would like for you to talk with Julie Brickville, and if she says fine, I'm fine with it.
[02:55:33.459 --> 02:55:42.101]  See, in North Korea and in that area of Georgia, and I guess in Nazi Germany as well, or Pol Pot's Cambodia, it's what they allow.
[02:55:42.101 --> 02:55:45.062]  I allow you to suck on my boots!
[02:55:45.062 --> 02:55:46.282]  I allow it!
[02:55:46.282 --> 02:55:50.163]  Since you ain't giving your kid the vaccines, CPS them!
[02:55:50.163 --> 02:55:52.304]  We don't need no laws!
[02:55:52.304 --> 02:55:54.985]  We don't need no stinky law right here!
[02:55:54.985 --> 02:55:56.165]  We can do whatever we want!
[02:55:57.461 --> 02:55:58.981]  Ain't that right, Enos?
[02:55:58.981 --> 02:56:00.121]  Yeah, that's right, boss!
[02:56:00.121 --> 02:56:00.662]  That's right!
[02:56:00.662 --> 02:56:01.322]  You show them!
[02:56:01.322 --> 02:56:01.962]  You show them!
[02:56:01.962 --> 02:56:04.022]  America's land of the slave!
[02:56:04.022 --> 02:56:04.942]  Let's watch a little bit more.
[02:56:04.942 --> 02:56:05.782]  They've got a bunch more.
[02:56:05.782 --> 02:56:09.583]  More than I... I'm actually going in my real accent now.
[02:56:09.583 --> 02:56:13.844]  We're gonna play more of this coming up tonight on the TV show, 7 o'clock.
[02:56:13.844 --> 02:56:17.485]  Go back to the video there, boys.
[02:56:17.485 --> 02:56:20.525]  You guys get much excitement in this small town?
[02:56:20.525 --> 02:56:21.365]  Is that off now?
[02:56:21.365 --> 02:56:21.785]  Turn it off.
[02:56:21.785 --> 02:56:23.386]  No, it's not off.
[02:56:23.386 --> 02:56:25.006]  Y'all were up at Chicken Man's house a while ago.
[02:56:27.276 --> 02:56:27.576]  Cool.
[02:56:27.576 --> 02:56:29.458]  You have any questions, feel free to answer.
[02:56:29.458 --> 02:56:30.678]  I'd be glad to.
[02:56:30.678 --> 02:56:33.580]  Were you called in on that at all for the chicken man?
[02:56:33.580 --> 02:56:35.662]  That's a tragic story.
[02:56:35.662 --> 02:56:38.744]  But they're off days, neither one of us are here.
[02:56:38.744 --> 02:56:42.867]  Unfortunately, fortunately off that day.
[02:56:42.867 --> 02:56:46.189]  Oh, unfortunately we were off the day his house blew up.
[02:56:46.189 --> 02:56:48.051]  Not a big deal though.
[02:56:48.051 --> 02:56:51.473]  New world order, get used to it.
[02:56:51.473 --> 02:56:54.415]  You don't tape the city hall in this area of Georgia.
[02:56:54.415 --> 02:56:55.356]  Get out of here boy.
[02:56:56.585 --> 02:57:00.127]  We've got even worse stuff coming up tonight, seven o'clock.
[02:57:00.127 --> 02:57:08.051]  But we're going to take you out here in just a moment with the Roswell, Georgia theme song now.
[02:57:08.051 --> 02:57:09.432]  But where are the Dukes of Hazzard?
[02:57:09.432 --> 02:57:11.253]  Well, they didn't get born.
[02:57:11.253 --> 02:57:12.153]  They were miscarriages.
[02:57:12.153 --> 02:57:13.634]  Mama took the vaccines.
[02:57:13.634 --> 02:57:17.256]  Well, one of them did, but he's unable to talk.
[02:57:17.256 --> 02:57:20.618]  So I guess, you know, that's what the system has done to us.
[02:57:20.618 --> 02:57:22.519]  And I'm tired of it.
[02:57:22.519 --> 02:57:25.701]  Oh, we've got American flags, but we don't have any freedom.
[02:57:26.581 --> 02:57:27.021]  You know what?
[02:57:27.021 --> 02:57:28.682]  You can keep the American flag if you want.
[02:57:28.682 --> 02:57:30.182]  I want the freedom.
[02:57:30.182 --> 02:57:32.423]  I love the flag because it symbolizes freedom.
[02:57:32.423 --> 02:57:39.206]  Now it symbolizes tyranny and corruption in this nanny state that is destroying our republic.
[02:57:39.206 --> 02:57:44.668]  We're going into an engineered collapse, Agenda 21, and it's time to wake up and realize that.
[02:57:44.668 --> 02:57:47.730]  It's time to spread the word and say no to tyranny.
[02:57:47.730 --> 02:57:49.450]  You are the Paul Reveres.
[02:57:49.450 --> 02:57:55.313]  White, black, Hispanic, old, young, Asian, Christian, Muslim, Jewish, agnostic, whatever your
[02:57:56.383 --> 02:57:59.465]  The view of the world is you better start defending liberty.
[02:57:59.465 --> 02:58:03.127]  I take you out here with their theme song for this hour.
[02:58:03.127 --> 02:58:05.269]  Here we go.
[02:58:05.269 --> 02:58:07.750]  Just some good old boys.
[02:58:07.750 --> 02:58:09.351]  Trying to steal your property.
[02:58:09.351 --> 02:58:11.613]  Trying to steal your first amendment.
[02:58:11.613 --> 02:58:13.034]  Never mean it no harm.
[02:58:13.034 --> 02:58:14.515]  I'm just going to arrest you boy.
[02:58:14.515 --> 02:58:15.836]  You don't stop taping me.
[02:58:15.836 --> 02:58:17.537]  Beats all you never saw.
[02:58:17.537 --> 02:58:19.238]  Been in trouble with the law.
[02:58:19.238 --> 02:58:20.819]  Except now they're the officers.
[02:58:20.819 --> 02:58:22.020]  Boss hog world.
[02:58:22.020 --> 02:58:24.961]  Spitting in the curb.
[02:58:24.961 --> 02:58:25.502]  Oh yeah.
