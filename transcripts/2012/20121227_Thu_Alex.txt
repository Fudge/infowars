[00:00:05.902 --> 00:00:10.746]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.746 --> 00:00:12.327]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.327 --> 00:00:13.868]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.868 --> 00:00:18.072]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.072 --> 00:00:30.181]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.181 --> 00:00:34.725]  This is an absolute maximum red alert, maximum red alert.
[00:00:36.127 --> 00:00:50.885]  The global governance operation is going into high gear and my analysis of the last few years that the globalists want to start a civil war in the United States is now moving into DEFCON 1 zone.
[00:00:50.885 --> 00:00:53.429]  Unfortunately, I've got to give you the bad news here.
[00:00:54.605 --> 00:01:10.219]  As of now, the foreign banks that have occupied the United States realize they're losing control, realize that Obama really lost the election, realize that their world government is in trouble and crumbling, and these enemies flee forward.
[00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:13.442]  And so they're going ahead with their go for broke
[00:01:14.918 --> 00:01:37.808]  Nuclear option politically to go for a full bore gun confiscation Saying that the guns are illegal and raiding selective gun owners and Arresting them burning down their houses having SWAT teams kill them basically open season on gun owners that will then invoke a massive response guarantee he will see
[00:01:39.238 --> 00:01:43.201]  Huge amounts of police wiped out.
[00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:49.486]  You will then see military brought in, and all hell will break loose, and Obama will be the savior.
[00:01:49.486 --> 00:01:51.988]  And he will fully take over.
[00:01:51.988 --> 00:01:56.211]  They are moving into that zone.
[00:01:56.211 --> 00:02:01.615]  This is not hype, and I'm risking my life coming on air, even covering something like this.
[00:02:01.615 --> 00:02:05.738]  This is the time, if you're going to roll over to the New World Order, better go ahead and do it.
[00:02:06.812 --> 00:02:10.436]  Put your hind end up for them.
[00:02:10.436 --> 00:02:14.740]  They mean to have a Stalinistic takeover in this country and to fully break this nation.
[00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:22.768]  We're not just going to get austerity and bankruptcy and shutdown of our economy and hospitals shutting down like Greece or Spain or other areas.
[00:02:22.768 --> 00:02:26.472]  The globalists plan to absolutely hammer this country, shutting everything off.
[00:02:27.327 --> 00:02:27.627]  I don't know.
[00:02:49.685 --> 00:02:51.546]  Army says Tea Party, their new enemy.
[00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:52.887]  That's Washington Times.
[00:02:52.887 --> 00:02:56.468]  We actually broke it off the Army manual, but I wanted to show Washington Times.
[00:02:56.468 --> 00:03:04.592]  And then you also print me just returning veterans listed as number one DHS threat.
[00:03:04.592 --> 00:03:07.154]  That's from four years ago, three and a half years ago.
[00:03:07.154 --> 00:03:10.475]  I want to just show new listeners, new viewers, those articles.
[00:03:10.475 --> 00:03:16.238]  You have to understand, I've watched this system build for 20 years, 17 years on air.
[00:03:19.266 --> 00:03:28.734]  And I've watched it go from an embryonic phase to skeletal form, to the organs, to the muscles, to the skin.
[00:03:28.734 --> 00:03:33.718]  And now it's there.
[00:03:33.718 --> 00:03:36.400]  And people say, well, they'll never get our guns cold at hand.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.042]  That's the whole plan.
[00:03:39.042 --> 00:03:46.088]  And it's a foolproof plan to cause a revolution, because even if 99% of gun owners turn their weapons in,
[00:03:47.076 --> 00:03:52.899]  You're going to have 1.5 million that aren't, conservatively.
[00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:54.220]  That's 1% of gun owners.
[00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.600]  That's a conservative estimate.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.122]  And that's going to be your terrorist force.
[00:03:58.122 --> 00:04:01.584]  The media now says gun owners are terrorists.
[00:04:01.584 --> 00:04:03.885]  And it's also supposed to be along racial lines.
[00:04:03.885 --> 00:04:12.509]  You notice MSNBC, CNN, Michael Moore today, he said, look white people, turn in your guns.
[00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:14.590]  And you're like, why are you invoking race?
[00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.491]  That's the whole plan.
[00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:24.262]  Is the government is going to try to invoke race where you're a racist if you don't accept collectivism.
[00:04:24.262 --> 00:04:32.184]  And we've all heard this talking point now from collectivists, a lot of them that operated as, you know, alternative media people, you name it.
[00:04:32.184 --> 00:04:34.065]  You're seeing them uncloak right now.
[00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:35.406]  Mainstream media, you name it.
[00:04:35.406 --> 00:04:41.448]  They're suddenly saying, if you don't accept collectivism and communism, you are a racist.
[00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.202]  You're like, what does that have to do with race?
[00:04:44.202 --> 00:04:44.983]  Well, you're a racist.
[00:04:44.983 --> 00:04:46.085]  Shut up, racist!
[00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:47.306]  We're going to get you racist.
[00:04:47.306 --> 00:04:49.589]  We're going to arrest you racist.
[00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:52.513]  And this is the new paradigm.
[00:04:52.513 --> 00:04:54.415]  We're entering the end of the republic.
[00:04:54.415 --> 00:04:56.818]  If you are going to evacuate, you better do it quickly.
[00:04:56.818 --> 00:04:57.459]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:57.459 --> 00:04:57.780]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:04.137]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:09.160]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:16.325]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:05:16.465 --> 00:05:22.110]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.134]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.

[00:05:30.858 --> 00:05:36.083]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[00:05:36.323 --> 00:05:39.544]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[00:05:39.544 --> 00:05:42.065]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[00:05:42.065 --> 00:05:46.806]  AeroSafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[00:05:46.806 --> 00:05:49.707]  Hand crank shortwave AM FM radios.

[00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.850]  Are you?
[00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.052]  Infowarsshop.com.
[00:06:01.052 --> 00:06:05.155]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu, and other illnesses.
[00:06:05.155 --> 00:06:06.376]  Don't be one of them.
[00:06:06.376 --> 00:06:12.080]  Protect yourself with Supernatural Silver, a revolutionary new broad-spectrum antibacterial solution.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:20.026]  Recent advances in silver technology have resulted in a silver solution that can be used daily to prevent bacteria, viruses, mold, and food poisoning.
[00:06:20.206 --> 00:06:21.887]  And help improve wound healing.
[00:06:21.887 --> 00:06:33.010]  Supernatural silver is safe enough to consume every day, while powerful enough to destroy the causes of many serious diseases such as strep, staph, pneumonia, colds, flus, and other harmful pathogens.
[00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:42.112]  This new technology has the ability to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.
[00:06:42.112 --> 00:06:45.773]  The Science Digest Journal says, silver is our mightiest germ fighter.
[00:06:45.773 --> 00:06:49.414]  It is virtually non-toxic and is emerging as a wonder of modern medicine.

[00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.735]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[00:07:07.735 --> 00:07:10.978]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[00:07:10.978 --> 00:07:13.780]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.803]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[00:07:16.803 --> 00:07:19.806]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[00:07:20.306 --> 00:07:25.511]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:28.193]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.
[00:07:28.193 --> 00:07:31.836]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[00:07:31.836 --> 00:07:35.599]  I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.

[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.702]  409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:08:08.467 --> 00:08:09.847]  You got a business.
[00:08:09.847 --> 00:08:11.988]  That, you didn't build that.
[00:08:11.988 --> 00:08:14.829]  Somebody else made that happen.
[00:08:14.829 --> 00:08:22.751]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is the 27th day in the Republic.
[00:08:22.751 --> 00:08:29.353]  From enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:29.353 --> 00:08:32.174]  So I say to you, I saw you again.
[00:08:32.174 --> 00:08:38.236]  Today, I had to turn my heart away.
[00:08:41.678 --> 00:08:44.800]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, it is December 27th, 2012.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.441]  On this Thursday edition, we are live.
[00:08:52.256 --> 00:08:54.657]  I was intending to take the day off.
[00:08:54.657 --> 00:09:01.461]  I promised my children that I was going to take off the entire week because I haven't done that in several years.
[00:09:01.461 --> 00:09:07.104]  But I ended up working basically the last three days and I ended up coming into the office yesterday.
[00:09:07.104 --> 00:09:09.265]  I'm not complaining about that.
[00:09:09.265 --> 00:09:17.389]  That should just give you an idea of the fact that for the first time in my life I'm losing sleep.
[00:09:17.389 --> 00:09:18.710]  For the first time in my life I
[00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:25.818]  I'm having to battle the instinct to evacuate this country immediately.
[00:09:25.818 --> 00:09:35.007]  I mean, I'm having to battle it hard, like holding down a bucking horse, because I am a person that cares about liberty, cares about our republic.
[00:09:35.882 --> 00:09:42.125]  But at the same time, I am a selfish person, and I also care about my wife and my children.
[00:09:42.125 --> 00:10:01.575]  But my family has been in the United States since the time of the Mayflower, on both sides of my family, and on both sides of my family in the founding of Texas, and I have deep roots in this republic, and had a lot of illustrious ancestors that were in the Revolutionary War, and I have chosen the course
[00:10:03.113 --> 00:10:10.554]  of facing the technocratic authoritarian takeover that is now happening in the United States.
[00:10:10.554 --> 00:10:15.295]  We are in grave danger, all of us.
[00:10:15.295 --> 00:10:31.338]  If you look at the full spectrum of analysis and information, if you look at how the Republicans, bought and paid for by the same foreign banks, are going along with socialist government-run health care, they're signaling they're going to go along with outright gun
[00:10:33.311 --> 00:10:38.755]  Confiscations?
[00:10:38.755 --> 00:10:40.457]  It's all happening.
[00:10:40.457 --> 00:10:46.481]  And the entire narrative, all the different pieces of the puzzle we have, are now put together.
[00:10:46.481 --> 00:11:01.293]  And our worst fears, our worst case scenario analyses, is what has basically popped out of the electrochemical computer.
[00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:34.824]  Right now, the globalists, the foreign six banks that control this country and that are crushing and squeezing Europe and using our wealth to build the world government, the eugenics-based, tyranny-based, scientific oppression-based system, they are openly going ahead with a program to publicly demonize all gun owners as terrorists,
[00:11:36.224 --> 00:11:43.828]  As racist, and as mass murderers, and lobbyist for mass murderers.
[00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:48.030]  You notice these quotes I'm giving you are all out of the news.
[00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:56.954]  And they are now openly saying, you bet, we're gonna come get your guns, and we hope you don't turn them in, we're gonna lock you up.
[00:11:56.954 --> 00:11:59.275]  I have the stacks of articles here, we're gonna be going over them.
[00:12:00.291 --> 00:12:10.154]  And there is a wild-eyedness to the collectivist minions who've been given very small portions of the loot stolen by the foreign megabanks.
[00:12:10.154 --> 00:12:15.256]  And their identity, the general welfare class, is tied up in the nanny state.
[00:12:15.256 --> 00:12:17.716]  And they know it's tyrannical.
[00:12:17.716 --> 00:12:20.737]  They actually like it.
[00:12:20.737 --> 00:12:25.879]  They enjoy living vicariously through that evil.
[00:12:25.879 --> 00:12:29.460]  And most states are now totally federally controlled.
[00:12:30.858 --> 00:12:32.019]  We've passed the Rubicon.
[00:12:32.019 --> 00:12:39.122]  I've got some numbers here where many states now have more government employees than even private sector.
[00:12:39.122 --> 00:12:40.463]  They have domesticated us.
[00:12:40.463 --> 00:12:50.708]  They have brought in 30 million illegal aliens who have now racially identified with confiscating guns and collectivism.
[00:12:50.708 --> 00:12:51.389]  They are now saying
[00:12:53.869 --> 00:13:01.492]  If you don't accept collectivism and French-style 80-plus percent taxes, you are a terrorist, you are a racist.
[00:13:01.492 --> 00:13:03.852]  And I actually have the news articles here.
[00:13:03.852 --> 00:13:20.318]  Now, if you look at the DHS manuals that we broke almost four years ago, that federal marshals, FBI, and state police and others sent us, they were so shocking at the time that even Ron Paul's office, when they were contacted by the Associated Press, said,
[00:13:21.678 --> 00:13:27.600]  Well, we know Alex Jones, we think he's a good guy, but we don't believe that's real.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:32.441]  Chuck Baldwin, for a day, didn't believe it was real.
[00:13:32.441 --> 00:13:43.104]  Even though it had phone numbers on it, and even though I presented a federally written state police report in Missouri and a federally issued master report,
[00:13:44.409 --> 00:13:51.050]  It took about three, four days before Homeland Security said, yeah, that those are real and those are restricted.
[00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:53.411]  You're not supposed to have those.
[00:13:53.411 --> 00:13:55.311]  And it said.
[00:13:55.311 --> 00:14:03.433]  The terrorist threat is gun owners, conservatives, libertarians in the fetters.
[00:14:03.433 --> 00:14:07.014]  But number one, returning veterans.
[00:14:07.014 --> 00:14:13.355]  Now, since then, they've come out and defended those reports and said, indeed, that is the enemy.
[00:14:16.454 --> 00:14:17.274]  So I knew that.
[00:14:17.274 --> 00:14:19.075]  That's just one little piece of the puzzle.
[00:14:19.075 --> 00:14:27.997]  There's hundreds here, and if I went over them all, it would take all three hours, but you as regular listeners, you know those pieces, and you know the pieces you've seen in your daily life, what you've witnessed.
[00:14:27.997 --> 00:14:30.538]  The attitude, the bearing of government.
[00:14:30.538 --> 00:14:34.439]  The army manuals change to about how to round us up and put us in camps.
[00:14:34.439 --> 00:14:36.280]  Army manuals on gun confiscation.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.260]  You guys just put one of the manuals up.
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.281]  If people are watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, let me give people that manual number.
[00:14:41.281 --> 00:14:42.661]  Please put it up.
[00:14:42.661 --> 00:14:43.622]  And this is army.mil.
[00:14:44.864 --> 00:14:48.547]  They're very, very proud of this.
[00:14:48.547 --> 00:14:50.388]  Interment Resettlement Operations, FM3-39.40.
[00:14:50.388 --> 00:15:10.363]  How to process your Social Security numbers, how to lock down the cities, how to go on grid patterns through the cities and take firearms, how to round up the political dissidents who do not agree with the collectivist model, and how to process us into the higher security facilities.
[00:15:10.363 --> 00:15:12.505]  Our families will be sent for forced labor.
[00:15:16.078 --> 00:15:21.882]  By the way, all of the little collectivists can't wait to march us around at the end of machine guns.
[00:15:21.882 --> 00:15:23.924]  They're all going to have guns.
[00:15:23.924 --> 00:15:30.028]  You understand, they're all going to have our guns that we turn in.
[00:15:30.028 --> 00:15:32.110]  This has repeated itself over and over again.
[00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:45.200]  You see, if you've studied the Nazis, if you've studied the Soviets, the Communist Chinese, the Cuban Communist, the Pol Pot, Camel Rouge in Cambodia, if you've studied these people, this is a
[00:15:46.588 --> 00:15:47.648]  List.
[00:15:47.648 --> 00:15:51.950]  This is a program, a blueprint, an operation.
[00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:55.151]  And it follows an exact program.
[00:15:55.151 --> 00:15:58.812]  It's called a program.
[00:15:58.812 --> 00:16:03.794]  And they want to do to us what they did to Russia in 1917.
[00:16:03.794 --> 00:16:05.895]  And God help us, it's going to be rough.
[00:16:09.153 --> 00:16:11.635]  And again, look at how bold the globalists are.
[00:16:11.635 --> 00:16:16.618]  How they use Al-Qaeda against Libya and Syria while telling us we need to give up our liberties because of Al-Qaeda threats.
[00:16:16.618 --> 00:16:17.959]  That's how bold they are.
[00:16:17.959 --> 00:16:19.340]  How dumb they think you are.
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.782]  How much control they think they're in.
[00:16:21.782 --> 00:16:26.185]  David Gregory has armed guards for his children.
[00:16:26.185 --> 00:16:28.587]  NBC host.
[00:16:28.587 --> 00:16:30.568]  Michael Moore does.
[00:16:30.568 --> 00:16:31.168]  All of them do.
[00:16:31.168 --> 00:16:34.731]  But they say you can't have guns to protect yourself and your children.
[00:16:36.479 --> 00:16:45.626]  They can't have anybody armed at the school to protect them, while they advertise schools as the place for unstable people who in every case get the guns illegally.
[00:16:45.626 --> 00:16:54.213]  The latest firefighter shooter, convicted con with a hammer, killed his grandma, went and stole guns.
[00:16:54.213 --> 00:16:56.075]  Do you even believe the story?
[00:16:56.075 --> 00:17:02.560]  Same thing, guy tried to buy guns, not once, not twice, not three times, five times in Connecticut.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.021]  Do you even believe the official story?
[00:17:05.964 --> 00:17:10.306]  But that's never mentioned, is it?
[00:17:10.306 --> 00:17:25.134]  The point is, when you have something sitting right in front of your face, and you know the government's putting armored vehicles in every city and even treaded tanks, and is spying on you without warrants and setting up checkpoints, and
[00:17:26.423 --> 00:17:32.868]  Having school children spy on their parents nationwide and engaging in forced inoculations that are totally illegal.
[00:17:32.868 --> 00:17:34.469]  They're going for broke.
[00:17:34.469 --> 00:17:36.090]  They're committed.
[00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:39.893]  And they've already pulled the bombardier switch and dropped the bomb.
[00:17:39.893 --> 00:17:43.315]  It just hasn't fully hit yet.
[00:17:43.315 --> 00:17:46.758]  Incoming, ladies and gentlemen, is what we're talking about here.
[00:17:46.758 --> 00:17:48.179]  They've pulled the trigger.
[00:17:48.179 --> 00:17:49.800]  They've dropped the hammer.
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:54.943]  The balloon already went up.
[00:17:54.943 --> 00:17:55.524]  God help us.
[00:17:57.406 --> 00:17:58.587]  God help us.
[00:17:58.587 --> 00:17:59.947]  Now there's the article about it.
[00:17:59.947 --> 00:18:08.292]  Army admits re-education camp manual not intended for public release.
[00:18:08.292 --> 00:18:09.793]  Just amazing when you go through it.
[00:18:09.793 --> 00:18:11.234]  It mentions how to take over U.S.
[00:18:11.234 --> 00:18:11.534]  cities.
[00:18:13.553 --> 00:18:15.955]  And again, people say, well that's too far out.
[00:18:15.955 --> 00:18:16.996]  It'll never happen.
[00:18:16.996 --> 00:18:20.640]  Sticking your head in the sand won't stop this.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:37.335]  Only really getting concerned and calling talk radio and going in and talking to your preacher and going in and talking to the police and doing banner hangs and doing AXS TV shows and doing your own YouTube show every day and
[00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:53.466]  Supporting this broadcast and spreading the word about it, and calling Congress and going to their public events, like the Proto Tea Party did before the Republicans took it over and gelded it, and getting in their faces.
[00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:56.048]  Because it's on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:56.048 --> 00:19:02.831]  The system is dropping the hammer.
[00:19:02.831 --> 00:19:05.553]  And here's what I'm trying to get to here.
[00:19:05.553 --> 00:19:07.974]  The magnitude is so incredible I have trouble even saying it.
[00:19:10.439 --> 00:19:15.321]  All of our previous research is now being borne out in triplicate.
[00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:17.422]  In spades.
[00:19:17.422 --> 00:19:19.643]  The system can't win politically.
[00:19:19.643 --> 00:19:28.286]  They've done the actuaries and know within a few more years constitutionalism and the gun culture and the liberty culture will convert.
[00:19:28.286 --> 00:19:30.967]  They even admit that.
[00:19:30.967 --> 00:19:33.148]  That we will win.
[00:19:33.148 --> 00:19:34.489]  So they're going to strike now.
[00:19:36.004 --> 00:19:44.470]  They are intending, and we have DHS sources on this unfortunately, and I say unfortunate because this is really, really hard to talk about.
[00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:50.013]  They plan on trying a gun confiscation to start a civil war.
[00:19:50.013 --> 00:19:55.197]  They're going to list gun owners as terrorists, and they're going to try to use the army against us.
[00:19:55.197 --> 00:19:57.498]  We're in deep trouble, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:57.498 --> 00:19:59.380]  This is going to be a hot globalist takeover.
[00:20:00.532 --> 00:20:05.997]  American gardeners and fellow Patriots make the right choice with your money, time, and your family food supply.

[00:22:30.778 --> 00:22:35.341]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:35.341 --> 00:22:41.145]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:22:41.145 --> 00:22:44.787]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:44.787 --> 00:22:47.629]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:47.629 --> 00:22:52.572]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:22:52.572 --> 00:22:52.873]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:52.873 --> 00:22:54.214]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:59.577 --> 00:23:00.998]  My name is Josh.
[00:23:00.998 --> 00:23:03.499]  One World Whey is the best in the market, hands down.
[00:23:03.499 --> 00:23:04.120]  I'm in the U.S.
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.301]  Navy, and I live a very active lifestyle.
[00:23:06.301 --> 00:23:09.063]  Being a vegetarian, it's hard getting all the protein I need.
[00:23:09.063 --> 00:23:12.825]  I tried their vegan protein powders, and I just wasn't feeling any change.
[00:23:12.825 --> 00:23:19.068]  The meathead supplement store whey protein kind of worked for a bit, but it left me feeling bloated, and my digestion seemed to slow down.
[00:23:19.068 --> 00:23:23.871]  By some divine stroke of luck, I heard a commercial of One World Whey on the radio, and it struck my interest.
[00:23:24.091 --> 00:23:26.434]  I have to tell you, I am so glad I got it.
[00:23:26.434 --> 00:23:29.637]  I have been taking it for a week and the results are amazing.
[00:23:29.637 --> 00:23:32.540]  I don't feel tired when I have to get up at 4.30am.
[00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:34.201]  I look and feel better.
[00:23:34.201 --> 00:23:36.464]  I recover faster from my two workouts a day.
[00:23:36.917 --> 00:23:39.619]  When I don't have time to eat good food, I take it.
[00:23:39.619 --> 00:23:42.781]  And I don't feel the urge to stuff my face for hours.
[00:23:42.781 --> 00:23:46.063]  I got up this morning and I looked the leanest I've looked since high school.
[00:23:46.063 --> 00:23:47.224]  I can go on and on.
[00:23:47.224 --> 00:23:50.086]  The best I can do to repay you is buy more and tell my friends.
[00:23:50.086 --> 00:23:50.586]  Call 888-988-3325.
[00:23:50.586 --> 00:23:50.786]  That's 888-988-3325.
[00:23:50.786 --> 00:23:51.647]  Or visit OneWorldWHEY.com.
[00:24:08.533 --> 00:24:13.354]  Ladies and gentlemen, you've got to understand, there's less than 20 families that own the Global Crime Syndicate.
[00:24:13.354 --> 00:24:17.455]  The Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, and just a few others.
[00:24:17.455 --> 00:24:25.796]  If they'll kill a million Iraqis just to destabilize the Middle East, if they'll put Al Qaeda in multiple countries, they'll do anything.
[00:24:25.796 --> 00:24:35.738]  If they'll give over 10,000 missiles to Al Qaeda, who is now using them to try to shoot down Syrian passenger liners, and our media praises it,
[00:24:37.182 --> 00:24:41.564]  The globalists think the public is in an absolute coma, but they're not.
[00:24:41.564 --> 00:24:47.748]  And the benchmark that the globalists use to mark you as their enemy is if you're a gun owner.
[00:24:47.748 --> 00:24:58.274]  They fundamentally, as a mafia, understand that when a mafia comes in to a grocery store and says, hey, we're here to shake you down, put your hands up.
[00:24:58.274 --> 00:24:59.794]  You got any weapons in here?
[00:24:59.794 --> 00:25:00.535]  Turn them over.
[00:25:00.535 --> 00:25:02.476]  Mac!
[00:25:02.476 --> 00:25:03.977]  Look where the mafia runs things.
[00:25:05.293 --> 00:25:08.035]  In cities like Chicago, New York, other areas.
[00:25:08.035 --> 00:25:10.236]  Total gunmans!
[00:25:10.236 --> 00:25:13.258]  They've all got guns, they're all armed.
[00:25:13.258 --> 00:25:15.419]  America is run by mafia!
[00:25:16.272 --> 00:25:18.514]  And the Italians always get thrown under the bus.
[00:25:18.514 --> 00:25:25.961]  The media makes it where only mafia is Italian, where we then even use an Italian word for hereditary crime syndicates.
[00:25:25.961 --> 00:25:36.310]  Folks, this country is completely run by a syndicate of interlacing corporate mafias that have assassins, that have mercenaries, that have everything.
[00:25:37.768 --> 00:25:47.778]  Major corporations, the top Fortune 100, have got mercenary crews with special licenses for grenade launchers and armor-piercing tank rounds.
[00:25:47.778 --> 00:25:49.419]  They're all armed.
[00:25:49.419 --> 00:25:51.802]  They run the NSA now.
[00:25:51.802 --> 00:25:54.344]  Over 80% of it is foreign-run.
[00:25:54.344 --> 00:25:57.587]  Foreign corporations can just dial right in and listen to your phone.
[00:25:57.587 --> 00:25:59.589]  It's all on record!
[00:25:59.589 --> 00:26:00.911]  America's gone!
[00:26:02.557 --> 00:26:09.298]  And the globalists cannot allow you to be armed before they fully bring us into a depression.
[00:26:09.298 --> 00:26:23.441]  I've got congressional sources, I've got homeland security sources, and they are saying the exact same thing that the Northeast Intelligence Network, who we're working to get on the show, their DHS source is saying.
[00:26:23.441 --> 00:26:26.421]  And that's they want to cause a civil war.
[00:26:26.421 --> 00:26:28.722]  They want to get a hot fight going now
[00:26:29.898 --> 00:26:31.939]  That's how they shut off the free internet.
[00:26:31.939 --> 00:26:34.301]  That's how they shut down talk radio.
[00:26:34.301 --> 00:26:38.583]  That's how they shut us up and arrest political dissidents and enemies.
[00:26:38.583 --> 00:26:40.605]  Because they can look at the graphs.
[00:26:40.605 --> 00:26:42.966]  That wasn't a mandate for Obama.
[00:26:42.966 --> 00:26:44.607]  That was a staged election.
[00:26:44.607 --> 00:26:47.309]  Staged with Romney, financed by the same people.
[00:26:47.309 --> 00:26:50.471]  But then they even stole the election, didn't give it to puppet Romney.
[00:26:51.727 --> 00:26:56.789]  Because they wanted to say it was a mandate for collectivism, a mandate for socialism.
[00:26:56.789 --> 00:27:06.412]  But when you read Foreign Affairs magazine put out by the CFR, when you read Foreign Affairs publications put out by the Washington Post, they freak out.
[00:27:06.412 --> 00:27:11.113]  And Brzezinski wrote a book this year saying it.
[00:27:11.113 --> 00:27:18.455]  That the people are waking up to global corporatism, that the people don't trust government worldwide, that there's a total awakening and the elite are in trouble.
[00:27:18.455 --> 00:27:19.936]  When they communicate with each other,
[00:27:22.645 --> 00:27:26.488]  They say, we're in deep trouble, mayday, mayday, mayday.
[00:27:26.488 --> 00:27:30.732]  But when they come out on the news, they're like, everybody loves big government.
[00:27:30.732 --> 00:27:33.214]  Oh, be quiet, white people, and turn your guns in.
[00:27:33.214 --> 00:27:36.617]  Here's Michael Moore in CNS News today.
[00:27:36.617 --> 00:27:42.843]  Michael Moore, calm down, white people, and put away your guns.
[00:27:42.843 --> 00:27:45.845]  And they go on to say, big deal, turn them in, relax.
[00:27:45.845 --> 00:27:48.107]  The black people aren't gonna get you.
[00:27:48.107 --> 00:27:49.629]  See, always invoking race.
[00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:51.529]  No, no.
[00:27:51.529 --> 00:27:54.171]  We're talking about the corrupt government getting us.
[00:27:54.171 --> 00:27:56.193]  We know what happens when you take the guns.
[00:27:56.193 --> 00:27:57.574]  People aren't stupid.
[00:27:57.574 --> 00:28:01.757]  That's why the previous record was 5 million guns sold in one month.
[00:28:01.757 --> 00:28:06.681]  They're now saying it might be 10 million in the month of December.
[00:28:06.681 --> 00:28:09.023]  And that's just what the scum government knows about.
[00:28:09.023 --> 00:28:12.166]  Folks, most people bought guns privately.
[00:28:12.166 --> 00:28:13.046]  You're not getting them.
[00:28:13.046 --> 00:28:18.030]  And a lot of people... Man, let me just warn the police and military something.
[00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:20.052]  You are meant to be destroyed in all this.
[00:28:21.621 --> 00:28:22.742]  I know you're not stupid.
[00:28:22.742 --> 00:28:24.423]  I mean, you understand this.
[00:28:24.423 --> 00:28:48.022]  If you go along with this, it is meant to cause massive attrition in your numbers, so you will then accept the NATO forces that are on record standing by to come in, in NLEO-9s or NLEO-11, National Level Exercises, and Washington Post, AP, Reuters, all reporting, oh yeah, foreign troops are going to help fight American terrorists during insurrection.
[00:28:48.871 --> 00:28:51.453]  That's mainstream news, over and over again.
[00:28:51.453 --> 00:28:52.434]  Look it up!
[00:28:52.434 --> 00:28:54.896]  This isn't fables, this isn't rumors.
[00:28:54.896 --> 00:29:02.303]  The lazy public just hears it, and then it becomes a rumor, and the media says, oh, the hillbillies think the UN's coming for them.
[00:29:05.319 --> 00:29:05.599]  Really?
[00:29:05.599 --> 00:29:06.900]  Have you looked at the New York Times?
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:10.221]  Scouts trained to fight terrorists and more?
[00:29:10.221 --> 00:29:11.101]  Three years ago?
[00:29:11.101 --> 00:29:15.343]  First line in it says they trained to confiscate guns from veterans?
[00:29:15.343 --> 00:29:24.586]  I've got footage from 1998 in Hebron, Maryland with Boy Scouts doing a drill to rat out their mommy and their daddy.
[00:29:24.586 --> 00:29:26.207]  Police State 2000.
[00:29:26.207 --> 00:29:27.627]  Key intel.
[00:29:27.627 --> 00:29:29.468]  This is bigger than Obama.
[00:29:29.468 --> 00:29:31.869]  This has been a long-term operation.
[00:29:32.884 --> 00:29:39.809]  And the plan is to wipe out the police and military if they pull this off.
[00:29:39.809 --> 00:29:43.051]  The police and military are the globalist's biggest enemy.
[00:29:43.051 --> 00:29:47.114]  That's why their own internal reports say the veterans are the biggest enemy.
[00:29:47.114 --> 00:29:49.516]  They want to wipe them out.
[00:29:49.516 --> 00:29:50.657]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.657 --> 00:29:52.058]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.058 --> 00:29:54.580]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:57.262]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.309 --> 00:30:06.810]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:09.211]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:30:09.211 --> 00:30:18.313]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure, and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:30:18.313 --> 00:30:21.773]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.

[00:30:32.236 --> 00:30:35.398]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:30:35.398 --> 00:30:38.780]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:42.922]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:30:42.922 --> 00:30:45.663]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:30:45.663 --> 00:30:47.244]  It's what my family uses.

[00:33:03.856 --> 00:33:07.018]  Fight?
[00:33:07.018 --> 00:33:08.219]  Against that?
[00:33:08.219 --> 00:33:09.239]  No!
[00:33:09.239 --> 00:33:10.860]  We will run!
[00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:12.621]  And we will live.
[00:33:12.621 --> 00:33:13.882]  Alright.
[00:33:13.882 --> 00:33:16.083]  Fight and you may die.
[00:33:16.083 --> 00:33:17.384]  Run and you'll live.
[00:33:19.013 --> 00:33:20.074]  At least a while.
[00:33:20.074 --> 00:33:24.496]  I'm dying in your beds many years from now.
[00:33:24.496 --> 00:33:41.265]  Would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that for one chance, just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!
[00:33:43.698 --> 00:33:48.721]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:33:48.721 --> 00:33:58.167]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:58.167 --> 00:34:00.948]  It's a trap.
[00:34:00.948 --> 00:34:04.230]  I don't bear any ill will towards police and the military.
[00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:09.013]  I know most of them got into it because of financial reasons or because of family history.
[00:34:09.013 --> 00:34:11.635]  Most people actually want to be helpful in their communities.
[00:34:11.635 --> 00:34:12.095]  I know that.
[00:34:13.427 --> 00:34:19.173]  In fact, as bad as the police are in this country, I've statistically found them to be more awake than the general public.
[00:34:19.173 --> 00:34:26.581]  The military is the only group more awake than the police, and I'd say three times more awake.
[00:34:26.581 --> 00:34:29.064]  Extremely hyper-awake.
[00:34:29.064 --> 00:34:30.645]  Of course the military's awake.
[00:34:30.645 --> 00:34:32.447]  They train to confiscate our guns.
[00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:36.233]  They train for civil unrest and takeover.
[00:34:36.233 --> 00:34:45.723]  And they hear my show talking about it in the last decade being the only broadcast telling them what they know is already true.
[00:34:45.723 --> 00:34:53.430]  And that's the big secret, is this radio transmission undoubtedly is the most popular in the U.S.
[00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:55.292]  armed forces worldwide.
[00:34:56.255 --> 00:34:59.517]  I have talked to countless active-duty officers enlisted.
[00:34:59.517 --> 00:35:16.728]  Well, you've heard the callers from all over the world where everyone they know, every unit they know, domestic bases, foreign bases, their officers come in and say, I've been told to tell you not to listen to Alex Jones and InfoWars.com and they wink at them.
[00:35:18.351 --> 00:35:29.836]  Our military is made up of some incredibly good people, even though they've been sent on globalist missions, they've been given false reasons for what they've done, false cover stories.
[00:35:29.836 --> 00:35:35.098]  They still served, by and large, because they were honorable people.
[00:35:35.098 --> 00:35:36.759]  And they also live in the real world.
[00:35:38.387 --> 00:35:40.869]  Where you get lined up and given experimental shots.
[00:35:40.869 --> 00:35:47.593]  Where you serve two, three, four tours and get your foot blown off and they stick a peg leg on you and make you go back into combat.
[00:35:47.593 --> 00:35:49.254]  Do you know that's going on?
[00:35:49.254 --> 00:35:54.698]  Where they give you PTSD when you collapse from heat exhaustion.
[00:35:54.698 --> 00:35:59.821]  After in some cases going 14 days straight doing mission after mission.
[00:35:59.821 --> 00:36:01.963]  They know the government's a pack of lying crooks.
[00:36:03.578 --> 00:36:06.539]  They know the high-level officers are globalist traitors.
[00:36:06.539 --> 00:36:11.560]  They know the government's growing the opium and shipping it out to America and Europe.
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:14.320]  They know our government runs Al-Qaeda and the Taliban.
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:27.703]  That came out months after 9-11, all over the press, where colonels and people would come back and say, we had the top Taliban general in order to release him and give him gold and fly him out to Pakistan to destabilize their country.
[00:36:27.703 --> 00:36:31.824]  It's amazing, ladies and gentlemen, when you realize the globalist master plan
[00:36:33.342 --> 00:36:40.028]  They get the Shiites and the Sunnis to kill each other in Iraq, and in Libya, and in Syria.
[00:36:40.028 --> 00:36:44.572]  And they bring in Al-Qaeda to get it started.
[00:36:44.572 --> 00:36:48.796]  And they plan on playing black off against white, and Hispanic off against white.
[00:36:49.926 --> 00:36:53.629]  With the government as the arbiter and as the referee.
[00:36:53.629 --> 00:36:54.749]  It's all divide and conquer.
[00:36:54.749 --> 00:36:55.810]  It's all British great game.
[00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:56.891]  That's what the British call it.
[00:36:56.891 --> 00:36:57.812]  Great game.
[00:36:57.812 --> 00:36:58.652]  The great game.
[00:36:58.652 --> 00:36:59.733]  Balkanization.
[00:36:59.733 --> 00:37:00.934]  Divide and conquer.
[00:37:00.934 --> 00:37:02.375]  They learned it from the Romans.
[00:37:02.375 --> 00:37:04.896]  They were a Roman colony.
[00:37:04.896 --> 00:37:05.797]  Albion.
[00:37:05.797 --> 00:37:11.781]  Britannia.
[00:37:11.781 --> 00:37:13.643]  And it's being repeated again.
[00:37:13.643 --> 00:37:18.326]  And America is slated for absolute re-education.
[00:37:19.878 --> 00:37:23.602]  Just like they imploded us in the Depression to get us on to government control.
[00:37:23.602 --> 00:37:25.625]  With Social Security, that was all engineering.
[00:37:25.625 --> 00:37:28.888]  That was just one one-hundredth of what we're going to witness.
[00:37:28.888 --> 00:37:30.931]  This is the big re-education.
[00:37:30.931 --> 00:37:40.221]  The globalists took their time using America to build their world government, while demonizing our name that was so loved worldwide, while at the same time putting us into debt.
[00:37:41.142 --> 00:37:47.987]  Undermining our foundations coldly, calculatedly, a guild of psychopathic criminals.
[00:37:47.987 --> 00:37:55.632]  When you look at Governor Cuomo or you look at Senator Feinstein, when you look in their eyes, I mean, I've met psychopaths and criminals in my life.
[00:37:55.632 --> 00:38:00.115]  The fake smile, the eyes illuminated with predatory desire.
[00:38:01.314 --> 00:38:02.215]  I know that look.
[00:38:02.215 --> 00:38:03.996]  They're psychopaths.
[00:38:03.996 --> 00:38:05.157]  They're not just sociopaths.
[00:38:05.157 --> 00:38:08.120]  I took my children to the Austin Zoo yesterday.
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:08.981]  I haven't been there in years.
[00:38:08.981 --> 00:38:10.162]  It's amazing.
[00:38:10.162 --> 00:38:13.264]  Better than the San Antonio Zoo.
[00:38:13.264 --> 00:38:15.927]  And they've got one of the biggest exhibits of tigers in the country.
[00:38:15.927 --> 00:38:18.088]  It's a rescue zoo.
[00:38:18.088 --> 00:38:22.672]  And I just looked into the eyes of those tigers.
[00:38:22.672 --> 00:38:26.836]  And it's that same predatory look where you look like a chicken leg to them.
[00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:35.855]  And they had a bunch of wolves, rescue wolves, six of them, right next to the tiger cages.
[00:38:35.855 --> 00:38:39.719]  And there were the wolves, and they had a large, you know, open field area for themselves.
[00:38:40.928 --> 00:38:45.051]  About 30 feet by one fence from the Bengal tiger.
[00:38:45.051 --> 00:38:48.233]  And that Bengal tiger would come over and would spray.
[00:38:48.233 --> 00:38:51.515]  He'd spray urine, you know, 10 feet at the wolves.
[00:38:51.515 --> 00:38:56.178]  And the wolves would get up and howl.
[00:38:56.178 --> 00:38:56.839]  You know what that is?
[00:38:56.839 --> 00:38:58.860]  That was calling in reinforcements.
[00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:05.045]  Even though there were only six of them in there, the instinctive fights with big cats, bears, things like that.
[00:39:06.621 --> 00:39:10.024]  They had that instinct of, there's the threat, there's the tiger.
[00:39:10.024 --> 00:39:17.429]  Don't Americans have the instinct to look at these criminal people in government and how predatory they are?
[00:39:17.429 --> 00:39:21.012]  A dog knows when somebody comes in your house.
[00:39:21.012 --> 00:39:27.917]  In my life, the few people that I've seen dogs growl at and not like, my sweet dogs, have turned out to be horrible people.
[00:39:27.917 --> 00:39:31.660]  Your dog knows scum when it sees it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:34.386 --> 00:39:36.927]  I wish I'd have caught video of that Bengal tiger and wolves.
[00:39:36.927 --> 00:39:41.208]  I may go back in the next few days over there because it was getting dark.
[00:39:41.208 --> 00:39:44.528]  They were about to close and this was all going on and my iPhone died.
[00:39:44.528 --> 00:39:48.649]  I got a little bit of it.
[00:39:48.649 --> 00:40:01.372]  And that tiger roaring at those wolves and those six wolves lined up looking through the fence at the Bengal tiger.
[00:40:03.004 --> 00:40:08.069]  If we had the sense of wolves.
[00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:10.711]  But I guess they say a wolf has incredible sense.
[00:40:10.711 --> 00:40:15.496]  Why am I trying to ascribe wisdom to humans?
[00:40:15.496 --> 00:40:25.064]  Doesn't take much wisdom though when you see a 2,000 pound or whatever it was giant Bengal tiger.
[00:40:25.064 --> 00:40:27.507]  Spraying urine in the faces of those wolves.
[00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:35.374]  Skyrocketing and attempting to get it, you know, however many feet it was across to their pen.
[00:40:35.374 --> 00:40:40.838]  And you just watch how Michael Moore and all these people do the same thing in our faces.
[00:40:40.838 --> 00:40:41.378]  That's what they are.
[00:40:41.378 --> 00:40:42.679]  They're dominating us.
[00:40:42.679 --> 00:40:51.726]  That's what the TSA is, dragging your kids and your wife off to be groped in public, have their pants pulled down in front of people, making old women get up.
[00:40:51.726 --> 00:40:56.529]  Now, TSA whistleblowers have gone public.
[00:41:02.092 --> 00:41:10.960]  And admit what we already knew, because it's come out three or four times before, even in lawsuits, that they save the naked images and they make fun of men's genitals, never getting tired of it.
[00:41:12.244 --> 00:41:15.647]  Because they have no dignity of themselves, why should they give you dignity?
[00:41:15.647 --> 00:41:18.649]  And fantasizing about good-looking women.
[00:41:18.649 --> 00:41:19.269]  I mean, I've seen it.
[00:41:19.269 --> 00:41:36.343]  When they see a good-looking woman, they run over like wolves, or like hyenas, and they drag her in, and sometimes they ask them out for dates, and sometimes they plant drugs on them and threaten them for sex, or they'll send them to prison, or other times they come up with a naked print-off and say, sign this.
[00:41:38.134 --> 00:41:48.241]  Four of its women, TSA, and I've seen them do this to Ventura, laughing, it's the governor, it's Ventura, aha, you know, grabbing his genitals, laughing at him.
[00:41:48.241 --> 00:41:53.064]  There's the case of movie stars being, you know, people come up with printouts and say, here's your naked body, will you sign it?
[00:41:54.534 --> 00:41:57.234]  While the TSA goes, we don't save your images.
[00:41:57.234 --> 00:41:58.315]  There's no naked image.
[00:41:58.315 --> 00:41:59.755]  There's no radiation.
[00:41:59.755 --> 00:42:02.595]  We're your friend.
[00:42:02.595 --> 00:42:04.216]  There's nothing these idiots won't.
[00:42:04.216 --> 00:42:12.697]  Because they're predators and it's all a big joke to them.
[00:42:12.697 --> 00:42:21.039]  Let me get to the meat and potatoes on this and go over the news here and then we'll give the phone number out and take your calls the next hour for military and police.
[00:42:21.039 --> 00:42:21.979]  As we do occasionally.
[00:42:28.087 --> 00:42:38.810]  The globalists hate the gun culture because as dumbed down as the public is, people get that when government tries to take your guns, it wants to enslave you and it can take everything else.
[00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:42.471]  People get a free man has arms, a free woman has arms.
[00:42:42.471 --> 00:42:46.412]  People now know crime is lowered everywhere.
[00:42:46.412 --> 00:42:50.613]  As you get more guns and more concealed carry, crime rates plummet.
[00:42:51.912 --> 00:42:54.634]  Conversely, areas that take guns, crime rates go up.
[00:42:54.634 --> 00:43:00.777]  Whether it's Australia, whether it's England, whether it's Scotland, whether it's Canada.
[00:43:00.777 --> 00:43:03.579]  And the FBI crime statistics are there.
[00:43:03.579 --> 00:43:06.641]  Massive crime dropping.
[00:43:06.641 --> 00:43:13.505]  Just like support for abortion has gone from almost 70% for it in 1973 to more than 70% in most polls against it today.
[00:43:13.505 --> 00:43:14.905]  If you look at every real issue,
[00:43:21.974 --> 00:43:26.256]  America is becoming more pro-life, more liberty.
[00:43:26.256 --> 00:43:28.897]  America is becoming libertarian.
[00:43:28.897 --> 00:43:32.918]  To the point of saying, hey, gays, get married if you want to.
[00:43:32.918 --> 00:43:37.780]  That's the one issue they can use and say, hey, Republicans, this makes people think you're behind the times.
[00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:43.562]  Whatever your issue is, whatever your point is on that, it's used as a political football.
[00:43:43.562 --> 00:43:46.003]  But America is becoming libertarian.
[00:43:49.665 --> 00:43:51.586]  And becoming constitutional.
[00:43:51.586 --> 00:43:54.628]  Becoming Thomas Jeffersonian.
[00:43:54.628 --> 00:43:56.370]  That's what's... You read Thomas Jefferson?
[00:43:56.370 --> 00:43:58.191]  That's what everybody wants.
[00:43:58.191 --> 00:43:59.472]  That's what makes sense.
[00:43:59.472 --> 00:44:03.314]  That's what makes you wealthy and successful.
[00:44:03.314 --> 00:44:05.996]  That's the animating contest of liberty.
[00:44:05.996 --> 00:44:09.278]  That's what everybody deep down likes.
[00:44:09.278 --> 00:44:12.100]  I don't care what color, what religion, where you're from.
[00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:14.101]  Deep down, that's what feels good.
[00:44:14.101 --> 00:44:16.043]  That's what feels right.
[00:44:16.043 --> 00:44:17.304]  You do what you want to your body.
[00:44:18.237 --> 00:44:22.019]  But don't you try to push it on me.
[00:44:22.019 --> 00:44:25.322]  So there's a fake liberalism where they push all these things on you.
[00:44:25.322 --> 00:44:26.182]  See, there's that agenda.
[00:44:26.182 --> 00:44:27.003]  That's not liberty.
[00:44:27.003 --> 00:44:30.445]  That's a cultural tyranny as well.
[00:44:30.445 --> 00:44:39.711]  Just as the Mullahs can be a cultural tyranny in Iran, or Al-Qaeda now taking over Syria, setting up the religious enforcement.
[00:44:39.711 --> 00:44:40.572]  That can be a tyranny.
[00:44:41.394 --> 00:44:45.975]  There's a hundred plus flavors of cultural tyranny and I reject them all.
[00:44:45.975 --> 00:44:51.937]  So here's the big message and here's what I want to get across to you and then go over the exhibits here.
[00:44:51.937 --> 00:44:56.218]  Because it's bad.
[00:44:56.218 --> 00:45:02.860]  Dianne Feinstein, I'm going to show you some of these articles here in a moment, right here in the document cam area.
[00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:04.461]  The globalists are coming out
[00:45:05.686 --> 00:45:07.988]  And saying, hey, we just want reasonable gun control.
[00:45:07.988 --> 00:45:09.849]  Told you for years that's the new spin.
[00:45:09.849 --> 00:45:12.071]  In the past, they said, you don't have a right to own guns.
[00:45:12.071 --> 00:45:13.492]  The Second Amendment doesn't say it.
[00:45:13.492 --> 00:45:15.814]  Well, we proved historically that wasn't true.
[00:45:15.814 --> 00:45:16.815]  So they said, you know what?
[00:45:16.815 --> 00:45:18.476]  You've got a right to own guns.
[00:45:18.476 --> 00:45:20.918]  You've got a right to turn them into us.
[00:45:20.918 --> 00:45:32.627]  On a blue moon, if five Keebler elves cross their fingers on top Mount Vesuvius in the twilight every 17 billion years, you can have a gun.
[00:45:32.627 --> 00:45:32.807]  Okay?
[00:45:37.509 --> 00:45:48.271]  And so she's come out, and I've got her public letters here, and I've got a bunch of others, and this is what Obama says he's gonna support, and she's part of the task force, where they act deliberative.
[00:45:48.271 --> 00:46:05.414]  They say, we're going, and she goes, to guarantee your rights, that's the funniest part, to protect legitimate hunters and the right of existing gun owners, 900 firearms are banned from sale, distribution, you name it, and anyone allowed to keep them will have to go to the local police department,
[00:46:06.167 --> 00:46:11.110]  And be fingerprinted and registered and then authorized by the ATF.
[00:46:11.110 --> 00:46:18.714]  So it's basically like when you go do the background check and get the stamp and go through all the stuff to get a full auto.
[00:46:18.714 --> 00:46:20.094]  It turns into a privilege.
[00:46:20.094 --> 00:46:22.315]  This is how they did it in England and Australia.
[00:46:22.315 --> 00:46:25.577]  Then they just say now turn those guns in.
[00:46:25.577 --> 00:46:30.760]  But she's also saying, but we're also just going to say we're going to ban miniguns
[00:46:32.315 --> 00:46:35.580]  This is just 900 where you've got to come register them and be fingerprinted.
[00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:38.263]  Kurt Nemo's doing a story on it right now.
[00:46:38.263 --> 00:46:49.319]  But with a bunch of other guns they're going to list, just giving themselves the executive fiat power and they're calling for Obama to do an executive order, you'll come turn your gun in and then they'll just pay you money for it.
[00:46:51.451 --> 00:46:54.474]  And then what they're planning, and they're telling police this everywhere.
[00:46:54.474 --> 00:46:56.556]  They've already done this in New York and other areas.
[00:46:56.556 --> 00:47:03.624]  You always hear about the old veteran who has the heart attack and cancer and doesn't go and get their four-year card in Illinois.
[00:47:03.624 --> 00:47:12.533]  And two days after it expires, the state police SWAT team hits the guy's house, drag him out, throw the guy in prison, they die in prison.
[00:47:14.128 --> 00:47:15.368]  And they're real lazy.
[00:47:15.368 --> 00:47:16.589]  They sit there looking at the list.
[00:47:16.589 --> 00:47:17.849]  Okay, that's an old man.
[00:47:17.849 --> 00:47:18.749]  He'll be easy to deal with.
[00:47:18.749 --> 00:47:20.170]  Yeah, he's been in the hospital.
[00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:21.210]  Yeah, he's on death's doorstep.
[00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:22.370]  Let's go arrest him.
[00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:27.551]  And they go with the news cameras and drag out a guy on a stretcher and then take him to prison to die.
[00:47:27.551 --> 00:47:30.212]  And then take their guns.
[00:47:30.212 --> 00:47:35.694]  And I even saw a Discovery Channel show once where a veteran had died in his house in L.A.
[00:47:35.694 --> 00:47:37.114]  and had legal lawful rifles.
[00:47:38.697 --> 00:47:40.939]  And he had an NRA sticker on his car.
[00:47:40.939 --> 00:47:42.741]  I played this clip about 10 years ago on air.
[00:47:42.741 --> 00:47:45.323]  It was called Inside the LAPD.
[00:47:45.323 --> 00:47:47.766]  And they go, look at this scum, look at this filth.
[00:47:47.766 --> 00:47:49.127]  He's got an NRA sticker.
[00:47:49.127 --> 00:47:50.328]  The cops say this.
[00:47:50.328 --> 00:47:55.072]  And they walk into the guy's house and they stand around and make fun of his dead body.
[00:47:55.072 --> 00:47:56.814]  And say, man, that gun owner stinks.
[00:47:56.814 --> 00:47:57.935]  And then laugh at him.
[00:47:57.935 --> 00:48:01.218]  And then the police say, I'm gonna keep this one, I'm gonna keep that one.
[00:48:01.218 --> 00:48:03.681]  And steal his guns on national television.
[00:48:04.315 --> 00:48:05.697]  And again, you're like, well, that's crazy.
[00:48:05.697 --> 00:48:06.339]  No, it's not.
[00:48:06.339 --> 00:48:09.925]  That's psych warfare to break your will.
[00:48:09.925 --> 00:48:11.728]  Veterans are scum.
[00:48:11.728 --> 00:48:13.431]  Veterans are trash, according to them.
[00:48:13.431 --> 00:48:15.394]  He has a dead body.
[00:48:15.394 --> 00:48:16.195]  He's pathetic.
[00:48:16.195 --> 00:48:16.897]  He's gross.
[00:48:16.897 --> 00:48:17.978]  And we're going to keep his guns.
[00:48:19.636 --> 00:48:22.837]  They were already 10 years ago teaching veterans were the real terrorists.
[00:48:22.837 --> 00:48:27.759]  They've just gone public now because they're getting ready to go operational.
[00:48:27.759 --> 00:48:30.960]  Let me show you some of these articles I have here.
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:36.863]  United States Senator Dianne Feinstein, right there she says, you'll come in and get fingerprinted and have your guns registered.
[00:48:36.863 --> 00:48:37.843]  Those they allow you to keep.
[00:48:39.042 --> 00:48:39.782]  Okay?
[00:48:39.782 --> 00:48:40.763]  Go read it.
[00:48:40.763 --> 00:48:41.323]  There's another one.
[00:48:41.323 --> 00:48:44.784]  New York governor, gun confiscation, forced buyback an option.
[00:48:44.784 --> 00:48:45.544]  That's last week.
[00:48:45.544 --> 00:48:51.747]  Kirk Nemo, thank God, DrugsReport.com put it out because then it forced Town Hall, Ammo Land, and others to actually go look.
[00:48:51.747 --> 00:48:55.548]  At first, they didn't believe it, because I saw the articles last Friday.
[00:48:55.548 --> 00:48:59.129]  But then, they went and looked and said, it's worse than InfoWars says.
[00:48:59.129 --> 00:49:04.111]  They found the letters Feinstein said, yeah, we're going to physically make you turn your guns in.
[00:49:05.731 --> 00:49:07.012]  So there's Ammo Land.
[00:49:07.012 --> 00:49:12.356]  My son and Como admit planting Australian-style forced government gun by that.
[00:49:12.356 --> 00:49:13.357]  There you go.
[00:49:13.357 --> 00:49:16.720]  Here's, since I mentioned this, here's The Hill.
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:17.460]  House Dems.
[00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:20.602]  Tea Party is the real enemy.
[00:49:20.602 --> 00:49:21.263]  Examiner.
[00:49:21.263 --> 00:49:28.588]  Army colonel ignites firestorm with article, well it's Army War College, on crushing a Tea Party insurgency.
[00:49:28.588 --> 00:49:30.210]  Here is Forbes.com.
[00:49:30.210 --> 00:49:30.790]  How the U.S.
[00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:33.252]  military would crush a Tea Party rebellion.
[00:49:34.326 --> 00:49:36.947]  Of course, we first broke this, but they all picked it up.
[00:49:36.947 --> 00:49:40.708]  Just giving my researchers props.
[00:49:40.708 --> 00:49:41.468]  Dim Reps!
[00:49:41.468 --> 00:49:43.048]  The real enemy is the Tea Party.
[00:49:43.048 --> 00:49:44.709]  Fox News.
[00:49:44.709 --> 00:49:48.229]  Sikh shooting ties DHS veterans as terrorist narrative.
[00:49:48.229 --> 00:49:50.870]  Napolitano stands by controversial report.
[00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:54.571]  Washington Times saying returning veterans are the number one terrorist.
[00:49:54.571 --> 00:49:54.911]  Alert!
[00:49:54.911 --> 00:49:58.272]  DHS rounding up veterans, throwing them in mental institutions.
[00:49:58.272 --> 00:49:59.612]  InfoWars.com.
[00:49:59.612 --> 00:50:01.073]  And that's also what they're announcing.
[00:50:01.073 --> 00:50:02.333]  No judge, no jury.
[00:50:03.991 --> 00:50:07.393]  They're going to just come out and arrest veterans by the hundreds of thousands.
[00:50:07.393 --> 00:50:09.574]  This is being set up and announced.
[00:50:09.574 --> 00:50:12.756]  And then what's going to happen?
[00:50:12.756 --> 00:50:26.104]  Well, they know a large percentage, not a majority, but because some of it's talk, a lot of vets are going to go Rambo, for lack of a better term when this starts.
[00:50:28.032 --> 00:50:30.455]  I would not want to be the police at that time.
[00:50:30.455 --> 00:50:32.277]  And again, that's going to help the globalists.
[00:50:32.277 --> 00:50:35.720]  The last thing I want is a bunch of cops getting shot.
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:39.905]  But let me tell you, they're going to go and raid gun owners.
[00:50:39.905 --> 00:50:41.246]  They're already announcing this.
[00:50:41.246 --> 00:50:43.228]  Heavy enforcement, taking legal guns.
[00:50:43.228 --> 00:50:44.550]  Vets are going to get mad.
[00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:49.174]  They're going to go out and do things that they probably shouldn't just to dumb down globalist minions.
[00:50:50.609 --> 00:50:53.870]  And then the Civil War is going to start, and that's the plan!
[00:50:53.870 --> 00:51:00.913]  Then Obama can pose a savior, ride in, declare all the guns taken, bring in the army, then the real Civil War starts!
[00:51:00.913 --> 00:51:02.213]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:51:02.213 --> 00:51:07.855]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:51:07.855 --> 00:51:12.917]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:51:12.917 --> 00:51:17.999]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:51:18.539 --> 00:51:23.783]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:51:23.783 --> 00:51:26.104]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:51:26.104 --> 00:51:30.907]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:51:30.907 --> 00:51:32.028]  And here's the best part.
[00:51:32.028 --> 00:51:34.810]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:51:34.810 --> 00:51:38.713]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[00:54:06.835 --> 00:54:20.763]  So, the globalist plan on prosecuting a overt, but also covert, low-intensity conflict, special forces-style operation against gun owners, to stir up gun owners into an active response.
[00:54:20.763 --> 00:54:24.166]  Of course, the police won't be told this.
[00:54:24.166 --> 00:54:26.307]  They won't be told 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:54:26.307 --> 00:54:34.152]  That's why we're here giving you the rest of the story, as if a lot of you didn't already figure it out for yourself.
[00:54:34.152 --> 00:54:35.632]  I'm beyond angry at this point.
[00:54:35.632 --> 00:54:36.293]  I'm very sad.
[00:54:37.629 --> 00:54:46.915]  And I'm kind of just committing myself to God, like George Washington and so many of our founders did.
[00:54:46.915 --> 00:54:52.358]  It's also reassuring in a way to know I've always been right.
[00:54:52.358 --> 00:54:58.962]  That the course of my research and God's hand on my life and the discernment I've been given has been given to me for a reason.
[00:54:59.949 --> 00:55:05.612]  And those of you that are awake out there, you've been awoken in your life for a reason.
[00:55:05.612 --> 00:55:07.232]  And we're going to make it through this.
[00:55:07.232 --> 00:55:11.334]  This will not go like Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union.
[00:55:11.334 --> 00:55:16.597]  And we will be able to, whatever comes out of this, defeat the globalist collaborators.
[00:55:16.597 --> 00:55:26.221]  Because the people in our media, in our government, that go along with this horrible balkanization plan, civil war plan, they are collaborators.
[00:55:26.221 --> 00:55:28.022]  Just like the Vichy French with the Nazis.
[00:55:30.757 --> 00:55:42.565]  And by the way, I've only covered a few of the reasons I know they're trying to start a civil war in this country and will probably blow up some federal buildings and stage some more mass shootings as a pretext to paint the American people as terrorists.
[00:55:42.565 --> 00:55:48.409]  I mean, you notice they're using these shootings and saying gun owners are terrorists, gun owners are racist.
[00:55:48.409 --> 00:55:50.230]  You're like, man, that's outrageous.
[00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:51.491]  No, it's not.
[00:55:51.491 --> 00:55:59.677]  They're they're now illuminating you, like lazing you for an airstrike, basically politically that there's the bad guy.
[00:56:01.508 --> 00:56:08.800]  You see, they demonize you and destroy your name and assassinate your character before they physically come after you.
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:11.905]  And so if you're awake and informed, you're like, why are you saying this about us?
[00:56:12.915 --> 00:56:13.916]  You don't get it.
[00:56:13.916 --> 00:56:17.158]  And I gotta say, more and more Sandy Hook does look like it was staged.
[00:56:17.158 --> 00:56:19.159]  Bare minimum, this guy was under psychiatric care.
[00:56:19.159 --> 00:56:20.580]  They were getting ready to commit him.
[00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:22.361]  They're keeping all that stuff sealed.
[00:56:22.361 --> 00:56:24.743]  Another wind-up toy, they turn loose.
[00:56:24.743 --> 00:56:25.643]  Very suspicious.
[00:56:25.643 --> 00:56:27.244]  The whole thing stinks to high heaven.
[00:56:27.244 --> 00:56:29.205]  So did the Batman shooting.
[00:56:29.205 --> 00:56:30.446]  And you notice the timing.
[00:56:30.446 --> 00:56:34.069]  Two weeks, three weeks before this, I said, I put out the magazine saying they're coming for the guns.
[00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:37.211]  Because they were opening up on us on every front.
[00:56:37.211 --> 00:56:39.132]  And I said, get ready, something big's about to happen.
[00:56:39.132 --> 00:56:40.713]  I mean, it's not hard to figure this stuff out.
[00:56:44.237 --> 00:56:49.141]  It is not, it is not hard to figure out what's going on here.
[00:56:49.141 --> 00:56:57.907]  And they're telling the police, gun owners, I mean I've got articles, I haven't even gotten to them yet, where the FBI is saying gun owners are terrorists.
[00:57:01.107 --> 00:57:02.389]  I mean, I've got it all right here.
[00:57:02.389 --> 00:57:08.156]  I haven't even gotten to the Piers Morgan thing because, quite frankly, that snot-nosed punk doesn't even matter in the final equation.
[00:57:08.156 --> 00:57:09.118]  But look at these headlines.
[00:57:09.118 --> 00:57:13.243]  Michael Moore's bodyguards arrested on airport gun charge.
[00:57:13.243 --> 00:57:16.487]  Michael Moore, calm down white people and put away your guns.
[00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:22.051]  Police investigate NBC anchor for showing gun clip.
[00:57:22.051 --> 00:57:23.972]  These guys all have armed bodyguards.
[00:57:23.972 --> 00:57:28.654]  I told you I had Michael Moore's bodyguards in 2004 trying to rough me up.
[00:57:28.654 --> 00:57:31.095]  They were like hitting me with their elbows when I wasn't even doing anything.
[00:57:31.095 --> 00:57:33.036]  I was like 15 feet from Moore.
[00:57:33.036 --> 00:57:34.677]  He was going down a city street.
[00:57:34.677 --> 00:57:39.419]  So I just like hit the guy back and the guy was a total wimp.
[00:57:39.419 --> 00:57:40.039]  Like what do you think?
[00:57:40.039 --> 00:57:41.540]  You gonna hit people your whole life?
[00:57:41.540 --> 00:57:43.540]  You punch me in the nose, I'm gonna punch you back in the nose.
[00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:44.521]  Whatever you do to me, I'm gonna do to you.
[00:57:45.339 --> 00:57:51.085]  I mean, again, these globalists are a bunch of wimps, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:51.085 --> 00:57:56.030]  And it's time to call their bluff and realize it's the global technocrats that are running all this.
[00:57:56.030 --> 00:58:02.656]  And if they're able to manipulate the police and then the military into an open confrontation with us, we failed.
[00:58:02.656 --> 00:58:08.082]  We need to be educating them and breaking their conditioning and deprogramming them right now like our lives depend on it.
[00:58:10.137 --> 00:58:20.119]  By the way, you know, I talked about this four years ago during the last campaign, how they said Obama will be the new Lincoln, the second coming of Lincoln, and they foreshadowed it.
[00:58:20.119 --> 00:58:24.980]  And I said, that means they're planning a states' rights battle with him and maybe even martial law.
[00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:26.661]  And then now they admit that.
[00:58:26.661 --> 00:58:28.301]  Oh, he's going to go Lincoln on you.
[00:58:28.301 --> 00:58:29.621]  He's going to arrest you.
[00:58:29.621 --> 00:58:31.082]  He's going to arrest people in the media.
[00:58:31.082 --> 00:58:35.863]  Hey, Lincoln did it in Spielberg movie, how great it was that Lincoln suspended the Constitution.
[00:58:36.869 --> 00:58:44.054]  I mean, they are really... That's just one more piece of the puzzle.
[00:58:44.054 --> 00:58:48.017]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:52.782 --> 00:58:58.384]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[00:58:58.384 --> 00:59:01.625]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[00:59:01.625 --> 00:59:04.426]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[00:59:04.426 --> 00:59:07.447]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[00:59:07.447 --> 00:59:10.448]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[00:59:10.948 --> 00:59:16.154]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[00:59:16.154 --> 00:59:18.838]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.
[00:59:18.838 --> 00:59:22.502]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[00:59:22.502 --> 00:59:26.747]  I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.

[00:59:45.701 --> 00:59:54.447]  409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:59:54.447 --> 00:59:56.829]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.829 --> 00:59:59.591]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:06.178 --> 01:00:11.000]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.600]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:14.120]  Well, so does he.

[01:00:18.322 --> 01:00:24.784]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.784 --> 01:00:28.285]  Well, Kurt Nemo's got new articles up at Infowars.com.
[01:00:28.285 --> 01:00:32.606]  Obama, own a gun, you're a racist.
[01:00:32.606 --> 01:00:34.887]  White House said to ignore Piers Morgan petition.
[01:00:37.193 --> 01:00:38.873]  The Bill of Rights is not negotiable.
[01:00:38.873 --> 01:00:40.354]  Share this urgent declaration.
[01:00:40.354 --> 01:00:42.074]  Mike Adams, great article.
[01:00:42.074 --> 01:00:43.334]  Here's Morgan.
[01:00:43.334 --> 01:00:45.074]  Time for an amendment to the Bible.
[01:00:45.074 --> 01:00:46.575]  See, they're going to take everything, folks.
[01:00:46.575 --> 01:00:48.375]  I want to just get you used to that.
[01:00:48.375 --> 01:00:50.695]  They're not going to just take your guns.
[01:00:50.695 --> 01:01:00.057]  They're going to tell you your kids are going to take shots, they're going to get abortions, how big your house can be so you can pay more taxes.
[01:01:00.057 --> 01:01:02.538]  Firearm confiscation plan announced for America.
[01:01:02.538 --> 01:01:03.718]  Very important report I did.
[01:01:04.707 --> 01:01:05.767]  I haven't even gotten to this.
[01:01:05.767 --> 01:01:10.089]  If you're on this list, you may be in grave danger.
[01:01:10.089 --> 01:01:20.713]  They're now putting out lists of where gun owners live so that people can rob you.
[01:01:20.713 --> 01:01:26.435]  And again, this is the media terrorizing gun owners like you're a sex offender.
[01:01:26.435 --> 01:01:33.658]  And I like the fact that internet folks have gone and gotten the newspaper where all they live and have put out a file on them and they're all freaking out.
[01:01:34.383 --> 01:01:35.684]  Let me tell you something.
[01:01:35.684 --> 01:01:37.045]  You did something like that to me.
[01:01:37.045 --> 01:01:40.808]  I'm going to sue you for harassment.
[01:01:40.808 --> 01:01:45.531]  And I don't care if you even defeat the lawsuit.
[01:01:45.531 --> 01:01:46.892]  I'm going to make you pay.
[01:01:46.892 --> 01:01:52.517]  Folks, you either get aggressive with these people, or they're going to eat our lunch.
[01:01:52.517 --> 01:01:58.261]  These murdering terrorists think that they're smarter than us.
[01:01:58.261 --> 01:01:59.162]  These anti-gunners.
[01:02:00.984 --> 01:02:04.705]  They think they're smarter than us and they know how to play us off against each other.
[01:02:04.705 --> 01:02:06.306]  These people are not liberals.
[01:02:06.306 --> 01:02:24.433]  The number one thing you can learn, if you know anything, I know most of you already know this, is that the brain bugs of these people, you know, the higher level ones, and I've been around them, I've read their writings, they see their followers as useless, ugly idiots who they just want to set up a big government so they can euthanize them.
[01:02:25.973 --> 01:02:28.914]  They revel in controlling others.
[01:02:28.914 --> 01:02:32.516]  You know, a powerful person can't stand having to control others.
[01:02:32.516 --> 01:02:36.878]  Even if you're the boss and gotta get things done, you get sick and tired of it.
[01:02:36.878 --> 01:02:38.499]  It's not fun to tell people what to do.
[01:02:38.499 --> 01:02:43.781]  I know one thing, my ego sure doesn't need it.
[01:02:43.781 --> 01:02:48.644]  Because I'm confident, and I am smart, and I'm an artist, and I have passion, and I have love.
[01:02:49.571 --> 01:02:51.272]  And I have a sense of justice.
[01:02:51.272 --> 01:02:52.633]  These people are the opposite.
[01:02:52.633 --> 01:03:08.566]  These are sniveling sacks of crap who never could create anything in their lives except join a corrupt predatory gang of government or corrupt corporations that get corporate welfare to suck off the rest of us.
[01:03:08.566 --> 01:03:10.707]  And they're the bane of human existence.
[01:03:10.707 --> 01:03:13.630]  They are parasites.
[01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:16.552]  Just like a tick, just like any other piece of filth.
[01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:28.492]  And they have this demonic, craven, murderous criminal energy about them.
[01:03:28.492 --> 01:03:37.935]  But they themselves are lusting after power because they are inherently ugly, weak, stupid, and filthy.
[01:03:37.935 --> 01:03:40.796]  And they project their self-loathing.
[01:03:40.796 --> 01:03:44.076]  They're smart enough to realize they're just filth.
[01:03:44.076 --> 01:03:49.238]  They come from lines of filth, lines of weakness, lines of miscreant trash.
[01:03:50.310 --> 01:03:58.054]  cretinous degenerate vipers like their father, the devil.
[01:03:58.054 --> 01:04:02.336]  And they see you and they want to pull you down.
[01:04:02.336 --> 01:04:05.017]  One thing collectivists love is running the arts.
[01:04:05.017 --> 01:04:13.801]  They love making artists and performers and playwrights come and kiss their, their, you know, festoon their rumpuses with kisses.
[01:04:15.182 --> 01:04:16.183]  They love it.
[01:04:16.183 --> 01:04:19.426]  It's their whole world is about playing God.
[01:04:19.426 --> 01:04:23.429]  I mean, I would never want to look in my neighbor's mailbox and know what they were doing.
[01:04:23.429 --> 01:04:25.531]  I never want to look in my neighbor's bedroom.
[01:04:25.531 --> 01:04:27.653]  Oh, these people, that's what it's all about.
[01:04:27.653 --> 01:04:33.578]  They love the little outfits and the little signets of power and the crowns and all the rest of it.
[01:04:33.578 --> 01:04:41.045]  They are a group of Skeksy-like peacocks, and they will fail.
[01:04:42.182 --> 01:04:46.185]  Humanity will defeat them.
[01:04:46.185 --> 01:04:48.346]  They will fall.
[01:04:48.346 --> 01:04:53.850]  Their technocracy will not be their greatest victory.
[01:04:53.850 --> 01:04:55.712]  It will be their greatest defeat.

[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:28.201]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.

[01:06:32.203 --> 01:06:35.365]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[01:06:35.365 --> 01:06:38.768]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[01:06:38.768 --> 01:06:42.911]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:06:42.911 --> 01:06:45.633]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:06:45.633 --> 01:06:47.214]  It's what my family uses.

[01:07:04.049 --> 01:07:09.055]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:07:09.055 --> 01:07:16.243]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:07:16.363 --> 01:07:21.985]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.

[01:07:58.735 --> 01:07:59.536]  InfoWarshop.com
[01:08:06.397 --> 01:08:11.221]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:11.221 --> 01:08:12.803]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.803 --> 01:08:14.724]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:14.724 --> 01:08:18.548]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.548 --> 01:08:22.851]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:22.851 --> 01:08:26.174]  Alright, my friends, we are live.
[01:08:26.174 --> 01:08:28.897]  It is Thursday, the 27th day of December.
[01:08:31.997 --> 01:08:38.640]  We're about to end this year and enter 2013.
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:47.703]  If you just joined us, I'm going to give the number out in a moment for active duty military, especially military police and police in the US.
[01:08:47.703 --> 01:08:48.343]  It's public.
[01:08:48.343 --> 01:08:50.024]  I covered it last hour.
[01:08:50.024 --> 01:08:55.466]  Homeland Security preparing the Pentagon for war with conservatives, gun owners, libertarians.
[01:08:55.466 --> 01:08:59.648]  I covered it in the New York Times, Associated Press.
[01:08:59.648 --> 01:09:00.488]  This is not a rumor.
[01:09:01.769 --> 01:09:03.910]  And people say, well, how will they start that war?
[01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:10.752]  The plan is to pass draconian gun laws that make you turn in all your semi-auto handgun and rifles.
[01:09:10.752 --> 01:09:12.333]  That's now being announced.
[01:09:12.333 --> 01:09:15.314]  It's getting almost no attention.
[01:09:15.314 --> 01:09:21.556]  The members of the President's Task Force, Senator Feinstein, Governor Cuomo, they're all saying, we're going to make you turn your guns in.
[01:09:21.556 --> 01:09:23.257]  I covered it last hour.
[01:09:23.257 --> 01:09:25.118]  And it's like, oh, well, that's just how it is.
[01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:36.689]  Meanwhile, you've got these suspicious Batman shooting and then the Connecticut shooting where the people look like mind control victims out of a Hollywood movie, both getting their guns illegally.
[01:09:36.689 --> 01:09:45.256]  You've got the Hammer Killer getting his gun illegally, stealing it that he used to shoot the firefighters.
[01:09:45.256 --> 01:09:47.098]  Now it turns out that guy was a Satanist.
[01:09:47.098 --> 01:09:48.920]  So because drug heads and Satanists
[01:09:49.591 --> 01:09:51.432]  Are out doing bad things.
[01:09:51.432 --> 01:09:54.093]  Statistically less dangerous than falling in your shower.
[01:09:54.093 --> 01:09:55.873]  We're supposed to turn in our guns.
[01:09:55.873 --> 01:09:59.054]  Government has always planned to go after our guns.
[01:09:59.054 --> 01:10:04.916]  The same globalists have taken guns in every other country but our nation and Switzerland.
[01:10:04.916 --> 01:10:08.377]  And they're now coming for them with the exact same program.
[01:10:08.377 --> 01:10:12.119]  Oh, there was a school shooting, we're just gonna register them and ban some.
[01:10:12.119 --> 01:10:13.019]  And then they ban them all.
[01:10:15.487 --> 01:10:16.848]  They have dropped the hammer.
[01:10:16.848 --> 01:10:22.431]  That's why Cerberus, the biggest gun manufacturer, they produce 81% of guns in the U.S.
[01:10:22.431 --> 01:10:24.332]  They're saying they might not even sell.
[01:10:24.332 --> 01:10:27.373]  They may just completely get rid of it.
[01:10:27.373 --> 01:10:31.756]  One of the few industries we had left.
[01:10:31.756 --> 01:10:34.977]  You've got the gun shows on TV being cancelled everywhere.
[01:10:34.977 --> 01:10:39.340]  But don't worry, Hollywood violence and race baiting, that's going to be intensified.
[01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:41.321]  You can see them dropping the hammer.
[01:10:42.346 --> 01:10:42.866]  And they know.
[01:10:42.866 --> 01:10:44.668]  Out of 170 to 180 million gun owners, some numbers are 150.
[01:10:44.668 --> 01:10:45.269]  It's a lot higher than that.
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:55.142]  If 1% refuse to turn their guns in, that's 1,500,000 terrorists.
[01:10:55.142 --> 01:10:56.602]  And you've seen it in the news.
[01:10:56.602 --> 01:10:57.943]  CNN and MSNBC.
[01:10:57.943 --> 01:10:59.083]  Gun owners are racist.
[01:10:59.083 --> 01:11:00.844]  Gun owners are terrorists.
[01:11:00.844 --> 01:11:01.824]  Gun owners are killers.
[01:11:01.824 --> 01:11:04.565]  Here's a Washington blog story at InfoWars.com.
[01:11:04.565 --> 01:11:06.346]  We can punch this up for TV viewers.
[01:11:06.346 --> 01:11:15.529]  The FBI will apply the term terrorist to any group it dislikes and then links to mainstream news about how they're shifting over to gun owners and conservatives.
[01:11:15.529 --> 01:11:16.309]  Remember that?
[01:11:16.309 --> 01:11:18.730]  The last four years where they said gun owners, conservatives.
[01:11:20.387 --> 01:11:23.208]  Libertarians.
[01:11:23.208 --> 01:11:25.128]  They are the terrorists.
[01:11:25.128 --> 01:11:26.528]  Remember the New York Times?
[01:11:26.528 --> 01:11:28.989]  Scouts trained to fight terrorists and more.
[01:11:28.989 --> 01:11:31.689]  Shows the Explorer Scouts three years ago.
[01:11:31.689 --> 01:11:34.950]  Training to take on disgruntled vets that wouldn't do what?
[01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:36.670]  Turn their guns in.
[01:11:36.670 --> 01:11:45.112]  Complete with dozens of color photos of the Iraq war vets being killed by the DHS UGAN.
[01:11:45.112 --> 01:11:46.692]  History repeating itself.
[01:11:46.692 --> 01:11:48.473]  People didn't think that was real at the time.
[01:11:48.473 --> 01:11:50.033]  Now it's completely widespread.
[01:11:51.909 --> 01:11:55.470]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have footage in Police State 2000 of scouts training.
[01:11:55.470 --> 01:11:55.890]  Go watch it.
[01:11:55.890 --> 01:11:57.271]  It's free online.
[01:11:57.271 --> 01:12:02.472]  To go in their parents' houses and tell the Army what guns Mommy and Daddy have.
[01:12:02.472 --> 01:12:03.893]  Is Daddy telling the truth?
[01:12:03.893 --> 01:12:06.374]  Is this all the guns?
[01:12:06.374 --> 01:12:10.555]  The Marines in America training for this.
[01:12:12.674 --> 01:12:16.657]  That's why the military is waking up, because by and large, they're good men and women.
[01:12:16.657 --> 01:12:19.759]  And they know they're violating their oath, even training to do this.
[01:12:19.759 --> 01:12:24.622]  So I want to give the number out, and then go over some of these headlines, and then go to your calls.
[01:12:24.622 --> 01:12:26.263]  It's official.
[01:12:26.263 --> 01:12:28.484]  Senate.gov, I covered it last hour.
[01:12:28.484 --> 01:12:30.746]  I'm going to go back over some of it here in a moment.
[01:12:32.048 --> 01:12:36.571]  Dianne Feinstein says gun owners will have to be fingerprinted and nationally registered.
[01:12:36.571 --> 01:12:45.576]  It'll be like a level three firearms deal for basically all gun owners, where they'll have to approve, have to bring your guns in and register them, and they'll decide.
[01:12:45.576 --> 01:12:49.858]  And she says that's part of protecting your right to own guns.
[01:12:49.858 --> 01:12:54.941]  Let me go back over some of these headlines here for you, okay?
[01:12:54.941 --> 01:12:59.304]  Cheek shooting ties into DHS veterans or terrorist narrative.
[01:13:00.714 --> 01:13:04.597]  Fox News, Democratic Rep, the real enemy is the Tea Party.
[01:13:04.597 --> 01:13:05.858]  Forbes, how the U.S.
[01:13:05.858 --> 01:13:08.020]  military would crush a Tea Party rebellion.
[01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:10.763]  That's how their number one enemy is the Tea Party.
[01:13:10.763 --> 01:13:14.806]  They openly train at West Point and at the ROTCs all over the country.
[01:13:14.806 --> 01:13:15.647]  Just look it up.
[01:13:15.647 --> 01:13:16.888]  To take on who?
[01:13:16.888 --> 01:13:19.670]  I've been to the drills, folks, before this was ever in the news.
[01:13:19.670 --> 01:13:22.333]  Everybody wears overalls and John Deere hats.
[01:13:22.333 --> 01:13:25.435]  It looks like my farming family.
[01:13:25.435 --> 01:13:26.476]  I've been to the drills, folks.
[01:13:26.476 --> 01:13:28.118]  I mean, John Deere hats.
[01:13:29.551 --> 01:13:31.351]  They practice mowing you down.
[01:13:31.351 --> 01:13:35.672]  Army colonel ignites firestorm with article on crushing Tea Party insurgency.
[01:13:35.672 --> 01:13:36.632]  Examiner.
[01:13:36.632 --> 01:13:37.372]  The Hill.
[01:13:37.372 --> 01:13:38.013]  House dimmed.
[01:13:38.013 --> 01:13:40.913]  Tea Party is the real enemy.
[01:13:40.913 --> 01:13:45.874]  Feinstein and Como admit planning Australian-style forced government gun buyback.
[01:13:45.874 --> 01:13:46.554]  Boom!
[01:13:46.554 --> 01:13:50.435]  That's now in Town Hall, Fox News, you name it.
[01:13:50.435 --> 01:13:55.416]  Five days after Kurt Nimmo's article, New York governor gun confiscation forced buyback an option.
[01:13:56.912 --> 01:13:57.232]  Boom!
[01:13:57.232 --> 01:14:01.273]  Here's Feinstein's letter stopping the spread of deadly assault weapons.
[01:14:01.273 --> 01:14:04.174]  She says to protect legitimate hunters and the rights of assistant gun owners.
[01:14:04.174 --> 01:14:09.175]  It's like saying to protect your life we hit you in the head 55 times with a hammer.
[01:14:09.175 --> 01:14:21.099]  And it goes on to say you will to keep your firearms that are grandfathered you will have to go into the ATF to implement registration and it says dedicated ATF implement registration of those with grandfathered 900 band
[01:14:23.501 --> 01:14:32.888]  Firearms, positive identification including photograph and fingerprint, certification from local law enforcement of identity, and the possession would not violate state or local law.
[01:14:32.888 --> 01:14:34.949]  So this is how New York did it 50 years ago.
[01:14:34.949 --> 01:14:37.271]  They said, oh, you just have a gun, just come get a permit.
[01:14:37.271 --> 01:14:41.774]  Then they charged a lot of money, then they quit giving the permits.
[01:14:41.774 --> 01:14:42.574]  There you go.
[01:14:42.574 --> 01:14:47.037]  This is what the president's getting ready to do.
[01:14:47.037 --> 01:14:47.918]  And then meanwhile,
[01:14:48.928 --> 01:14:50.529]  The general public isn't even aware of this.
[01:14:50.529 --> 01:14:55.433]  Napolitano stands by controversial report saying returning veterans are the number one terror threat.
[01:14:55.433 --> 01:14:56.253]  Washington Times.
[01:14:56.253 --> 01:14:57.834]  I'm showing you articles.
[01:14:57.834 --> 01:14:58.215]  Alert!
[01:14:58.215 --> 01:15:03.278]  DHS rounding up veterans, throwing them in mental institutions for simply criticizing Obama.
[01:15:03.278 --> 01:15:04.299]  InfoWars.com
[01:15:05.216 --> 01:15:06.417]  Okay.
[01:15:06.417 --> 01:15:08.639]  You're like, well, this will cause a civil war.
[01:15:08.639 --> 01:15:16.504]  I mean, if they try to do what they've done in New York and Connecticut and Illinois, where they say, okay, come register your guns.
[01:15:16.504 --> 01:15:20.427]  You got to get a yearly FOID card retroactively.
[01:15:20.427 --> 01:15:22.309]  And everybody pretty much went and complied.
[01:15:22.309 --> 01:15:25.951]  And then the minute you're in the hospital, that's who they usually hit.
[01:15:25.951 --> 01:15:30.074]  Like I mentioned last hour, it's, it's in the Illinois news.
[01:15:30.074 --> 01:15:30.635]  They come.
[01:15:32.714 --> 01:15:35.175]  And they SWAT team your house and make a big deal about it on the news.
[01:15:35.175 --> 01:15:39.095]  They're going to do this, folks, and they're going to take your guns, and they're going to call you terrorists.
[01:15:39.095 --> 01:15:44.317]  They're already saying gun owners are the filth of the earth, gun owners need to be killed, gun owners are racist.
[01:15:44.317 --> 01:15:46.477]  I mean, it's all over the news.
[01:15:46.477 --> 01:15:51.398]  This is the demonization.
[01:15:51.398 --> 01:15:52.778]  This is so huge.
[01:15:52.778 --> 01:16:00.120]  And now all these House Republicans are coming out, and Senators, saying they're going to support the reasonable gun ban.
[01:16:01.051 --> 01:16:01.651]  And you know what?
[01:16:01.651 --> 01:16:03.032]  They're like, you know what?
[01:16:03.032 --> 01:16:04.992]  You're not just going to not sell those anymore.
[01:16:04.992 --> 01:16:08.954]  We're going to ban most of them and the others, you're going to come in and register.
[01:16:08.954 --> 01:16:11.455]  You're going to have a little visit with the police officers.
[01:16:11.455 --> 01:16:13.135]  They already know what gun you've got.
[01:16:13.135 --> 01:16:14.416]  They already know your law abiding.
[01:16:14.416 --> 01:16:15.956]  They know the guns lower crime.
[01:16:15.956 --> 01:16:20.218]  They're getting ready to fully implode the economy and take your pension funds.
[01:16:20.218 --> 01:16:25.460]  And they know that when they take the pensions paid for by especially
[01:16:27.515 --> 01:16:32.217]  Non-commissioned officers, they know those types that have been in 23-25 years.
[01:16:32.217 --> 01:16:35.738]  They know the veterans are going to get mad.
[01:16:35.738 --> 01:16:38.599]  And that's fine, because they're going to kill you.
[01:16:38.599 --> 01:16:41.641]  They've already trained to take you on, okay?
[01:16:41.641 --> 01:16:44.382]  This is a criminal foreign banking takeover.
[01:16:44.382 --> 01:16:50.624]  Mega banks combined with communists at the grassroots.
[01:16:50.624 --> 01:16:51.024]  U.S.
[01:16:51.024 --> 01:16:54.286]  Treasury raids federal employee pension funds to cover debts.
[01:16:54.286 --> 01:16:54.626]  See?
[01:16:54.626 --> 01:16:55.266]  It's already started.
[01:16:57.608 --> 01:17:00.350]  That's in Forbes, AP, Reuters, you name it.
[01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:02.571]  See, I told you all this was coming.
[01:17:02.571 --> 01:17:03.192]  How did I know?
[01:17:03.192 --> 01:17:07.354]  Seven years ago, they changed the federal law where they can take your pension funds, public or private.
[01:17:07.354 --> 01:17:08.795]  And they're coming.
[01:17:08.795 --> 01:17:09.456]  They're coming.
[01:17:09.456 --> 01:17:10.296]  You got it?
[01:17:10.296 --> 01:17:11.437]  They've done it in every other country.
[01:17:11.437 --> 01:17:13.118]  They're following an exact plan.
[01:17:13.118 --> 01:17:14.299]  How do I know what's coming next?
[01:17:14.299 --> 01:17:16.400]  They've done it before.
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:20.423]  But here, you know the real Crocodile Dundee?
[01:17:20.423 --> 01:17:24.266]  This was actually in Shotgun News more than 12, 13 years ago.
[01:17:24.266 --> 01:17:24.666]  I covered it.
[01:17:27.759 --> 01:17:30.280]  The real Crocodile Dundee was killed.
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:32.181]  He was a trapper.
[01:17:32.181 --> 01:17:34.083]  He took people on tours.
[01:17:34.083 --> 01:17:35.804]  They had already taken his semi-autos.
[01:17:35.804 --> 01:17:37.725]  They wanted his bolt actions.
[01:17:37.725 --> 01:17:41.447]  And they came out like hot shots with a SWAT team bragging they were going to kill him.
[01:17:41.447 --> 01:17:43.748]  And he fought back, killed a couple of them, they killed him.
[01:17:43.748 --> 01:17:48.631]  Did you know they actually attacked and killed over the decade after the gunman in Australia?
[01:17:49.890 --> 01:17:51.331]  Over a thousand Aussies.
[01:17:51.331 --> 01:17:52.753]  They murdered them.
[01:17:52.753 --> 01:17:57.097]  They would go to the farthest swamp and kill because it's hunting.
[01:17:57.097 --> 01:17:59.079]  They want to hunt gun owners.
[01:17:59.079 --> 01:18:01.321]  We are the most hated people.
[01:18:01.321 --> 01:18:02.702]  Veterans, gun owners.
[01:18:02.702 --> 01:18:06.326]  The real Crocodile Dundee dies in a police shootout.
[01:18:06.326 --> 01:18:06.986]  And that's out of what?
[01:18:06.986 --> 01:18:09.589]  The London Independent?
[01:18:09.589 --> 01:18:09.749]  Yep.
[01:18:10.728 --> 01:18:11.329]  There you go.
[01:18:11.329 --> 01:18:12.690]  Go read it for yourself.
[01:18:12.690 --> 01:18:21.260]  The rugged Australian rancher whose feats of survival in the Outback inspired the movie character Crocodile Dundee was killed in a shootout.
[01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:22.141]  Now let me tell you something.
[01:18:24.022 --> 01:18:26.103]  The globalists don't care how many cops die.
[01:18:26.103 --> 01:18:27.464]  They hate your guts, too.
[01:18:27.464 --> 01:18:27.764]  Okay?
[01:18:27.764 --> 01:18:31.806]  This is a criminal, illegitimate government that probably staged the shootings.
[01:18:31.806 --> 01:18:33.867]  These guys are always following the same M.O.
[01:18:33.867 --> 01:18:35.928]  With illegal guns under doctor's care.
[01:18:35.928 --> 01:18:38.289]  One guy under a DARPA mind control program.
[01:18:38.289 --> 01:18:39.670]  The Batman shooter.
[01:18:39.670 --> 01:18:41.831]  I want to hear from police and military.
[01:18:41.831 --> 01:18:45.753]  Active police, active military.
[01:18:45.753 --> 01:18:49.835]  I know they've hired a lot of Rambo-type cops that think their war against America is going to be fun.
[01:18:49.835 --> 01:18:51.056]  Well, I feel sorry for those idiots.
[01:18:52.165 --> 01:18:55.087]  You have no idea what you're about to be part of.
[01:18:55.087 --> 01:18:57.549]  And the plan is to get us to wipe each other out.
[01:18:57.549 --> 01:18:59.671]  Do the police and military agree?
[01:18:59.671 --> 01:19:01.032]  Are you not training to do this?
[01:19:01.032 --> 01:19:02.132]  It's admitted.
[01:19:02.132 --> 01:19:03.794]  It's all starting.
[01:19:03.794 --> 01:19:06.236]  Are you going to go after the American people and take their guns?
[01:19:06.236 --> 01:19:07.977]  Because here's the problem.
[01:19:07.977 --> 01:19:10.199]  800-259-9231.
[01:19:10.199 --> 01:19:12.520]  Here's the rest of the story.
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:15.643]  Just like Katrina, we later learned most of the military refused to take guns.
[01:19:15.643 --> 01:19:16.403]  They didn't care.
[01:19:16.403 --> 01:19:18.605]  They showed units that would do it to acclimate everybody.
[01:19:20.609 --> 01:19:22.649]  Most military and police aren't going to refuse.
[01:19:22.649 --> 01:19:23.349]  They're not going to care.
[01:19:23.349 --> 01:19:29.090]  They're going to send special units in to commit atrocities against patriots.
[01:19:29.090 --> 01:19:37.052]  More WACOs trying to elicit a paramilitary asymmetrical counter-response, counter-revolution that they'll call a terrorist revolution.
[01:19:37.052 --> 01:19:38.552]  The terrorists are taking over.
[01:19:38.552 --> 01:19:40.132]  They're engaged in a revolution.
[01:19:40.132 --> 01:19:44.353]  They want to start the fight to call counter-revolutionaries, real Americans, the terrorists.
[01:19:44.353 --> 01:19:44.873]  800-259-9231.
[01:19:44.873 --> 01:19:46.854]  See, that's the rest of the story here.
[01:19:50.168 --> 01:19:53.911]  And they're going to stage atrocities and blame it on the Patriots.
[01:19:53.911 --> 01:19:53.971]  800-259-9231.
[01:19:53.971 --> 01:19:56.713]  Do you understand?
[01:19:56.713 --> 01:19:58.594]  We're on the edge right now.
[01:19:58.594 --> 01:19:59.815]  I want to talk to police and others.
[01:19:59.815 --> 01:20:02.257]  Straight ahead.
[01:20:02.257 --> 01:20:04.898]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East.
[01:20:04.898 --> 01:20:07.760]  But we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:10.943]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[01:20:10.943 --> 01:20:13.725]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[01:20:13.725 --> 01:20:16.667]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[01:20:16.667 --> 01:20:19.649]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[01:20:20.109 --> 01:20:25.256]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[01:20:25.256 --> 01:20:27.859]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.
[01:20:27.859 --> 01:20:31.464]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[01:20:31.464 --> 01:20:35.168]  I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.
[01:20:35.168 --> 01:20:38.753]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials.
[01:20:39.013 --> 01:20:43.354]  And you can start with a holiday gift pack that's normally $80, now under $50.
[01:20:43.354 --> 01:20:45.555]  Remember, I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[01:20:45.555 --> 01:20:51.177]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:20:51.177 --> 01:20:54.278]  Would you rather prepare six months too early or one day too late?
[01:20:54.278 --> 01:21:00.500]  409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:05.281]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:21:05.281 --> 01:21:07.382]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:21:08.295 --> 01:21:17.270]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:22.178]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:21:22.817 --> 01:21:34.187]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[01:21:34.187 --> 01:21:41.193]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[01:21:41.853 --> 01:21:46.157]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[01:21:46.157 --> 01:21:49.759]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[01:21:49.759 --> 01:21:57.025]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[01:21:57.025 --> 01:21:58.286]  Protect your immune system.
[01:21:58.286 --> 01:21:59.327]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:22:00.458 --> 01:22:03.659]  Friends, this is Alex Jones for MidasResources.com.
[01:22:03.659 --> 01:22:09.240]  For more than 15 years, I have exclusively used Midas Resources for all my precious metal needs.
[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:14.861]  Whether it's bullion or collectibles you're looking for, Midas Resources is simply the best.
[01:22:14.861 --> 01:22:17.462]  I own my gold as a hedge against inflation.
[01:22:17.462 --> 01:22:23.783]  This Federal Reserve fiat currency could go the way of the Deutsche Mark and the Weimar Republic any time.
[01:22:23.783 --> 01:22:28.284]  In these historically dangerous times, it makes sense to physically hold gold and silver.
[01:22:28.664 --> 01:22:31.545]  Midas already has some of the best deals in the industry.
[01:22:31.545 --> 01:22:37.107]  But if you give them a call and mention the radio special, they will give you a list of the day's super specials.
[01:22:37.107 --> 01:22:42.450]  Midas brokers are standing by to answer all your questions at 800-686-2237.
[01:22:42.450 --> 01:22:49.773]  They also have a lot of informative free literature explaining the opportunities and risk of holding precious metals.
[01:22:49.773 --> 01:22:51.713]  They are ready to answer your questions at 800-686-2237.
[01:22:51.713 --> 01:22:52.053]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:59.201 --> 01:23:07.490]  Hi, my name is Annette and due to menopause symptoms for nearly two years, I suffered severe hot flashes which prevented me from sleeping all night.
[01:23:07.490 --> 01:23:11.954]  It was so hard to work because I continued all day to have the hot flashes from hell.
[01:23:11.954 --> 01:23:14.337]  I was exhausted and depleted.
[01:23:14.337 --> 01:23:19.142]  After only three weeks on One World Way, I have no hot flashes and I'm sleeping normally again.
[01:23:19.142 --> 01:23:21.324]  I feel energized and strong.
[01:23:21.784 --> 01:23:23.065]  This is an amazing product.
[01:23:41.411 --> 01:23:41.651]  I think so.
[01:24:08.061 --> 01:24:09.522]  All right, Alex Jones here, back live.
[01:24:09.522 --> 01:24:10.582]  We're going right to your calls.
[01:24:10.582 --> 01:24:14.403]  Again, I've only covered a few of the points.
[01:24:14.403 --> 01:24:27.368]  The government admits they're preparing for civil war, civil unrest, and the government is saying the veterans, gun owners, constitutionalists, conservatives, libertarians are the enemy.
[01:24:27.368 --> 01:24:30.609]  Remember just four years ago, we got all these documents, people couldn't believe it.
[01:24:30.609 --> 01:24:32.049]  Now it's mainstream news.
[01:24:32.049 --> 01:24:34.330]  Yeah, and you're a racist too, and we're gonna arrest you.
[01:24:36.485 --> 01:24:47.831]  All they gotta do is blow up some federal buildings, wire up some patsies, set some people up, tell somebody they're in a drill of attacking a police station, they kill the guys in the drill, say they're the terrorists.
[01:24:47.831 --> 01:24:49.872]  I mean, it's so easy how they do this.
[01:24:49.872 --> 01:24:53.374]  They use drills at schools, you name it, as the covers.
[01:24:53.374 --> 01:24:54.214]  We've caught them!
[01:24:54.214 --> 01:24:55.555]  That's been declassified before.
[01:24:56.215 --> 01:25:05.322]  Operation Gladio got rid of all the liberties in Europe, basically, from the 50s until the 80s, blowing up school buses and shooting up schools and stuff.
[01:25:05.322 --> 01:25:08.805]  That's how they took the guns in Italy, with staged school shootings.
[01:25:08.805 --> 01:25:13.248]  By the way, just type in government staged terror attacks with CIA, Italy.
[01:25:13.248 --> 01:25:17.652]  You'll get the Italian Supreme Court declassifying it all, what, five years ago.
[01:25:18.888 --> 01:25:20.790]  That was just one country where they did it.
[01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:30.960]  Yes, our government sent special forces in, and they'd bring a communist in, shoot him in the back of the head to blame him, and then have the special forces go out the back, shoot a bunch of kids.
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:33.462]  I mean, this is how they do it.
[01:25:33.462 --> 01:25:38.147]  That's why, if anybody ever wants to be part of a drill, even if you know everybody involved,
[01:25:39.312 --> 01:25:43.476]  There's always that chance it's going to be time to set you up.
[01:25:43.476 --> 01:25:47.340]  So you better know everybody there, they better be from your police department.
[01:25:47.340 --> 01:25:53.867]  If they come and tell you as a cop or as anybody else, hey, come as a citizen, come be part of our little drill we're going to do.
[01:25:53.867 --> 01:25:54.828]  It's an unannounced drill.
[01:25:54.828 --> 01:25:55.429]  Don't be part of it.
[01:25:58.675 --> 01:25:59.916]  Alright, let's just stop right there.
[01:25:59.916 --> 01:26:00.797]  I gotta go to your calls.
[01:26:00.797 --> 01:26:02.939]  We've got Sean in Iowa, who's a police officer.
[01:26:02.939 --> 01:26:05.281]  We've got David in Kentucky, who's Army.
[01:26:05.281 --> 01:26:08.044]  We've got Carl in North Carolina, who's Marine.
[01:26:08.044 --> 01:26:08.965]  John, who's U.S.
[01:26:08.965 --> 01:26:09.205]  Navy.
[01:26:09.205 --> 01:26:11.207]  We're gonna get to all of you here.
[01:26:11.207 --> 01:26:11.768]  But here's the deal.
[01:26:13.208 --> 01:26:18.652]  You notice they talk about the states rebelling and Obama will be the new Lincoln when the states revolt.
[01:26:18.652 --> 01:26:30.561]  And I'd see that four years ago and go, they're archetyping him as Lincoln and saying Lincoln brought in martial law and arrested hundreds of members of the media and dozens of Congress and governors.
[01:26:30.561 --> 01:26:34.685]  They're getting ready to try to bring in stuff so unpopular, the states revolt.
[01:26:35.751 --> 01:26:42.173]  And then sure enough, they're doing that, and it dovetails with the John Warner Defense Authorization Act that predates Obama.
[01:26:42.173 --> 01:26:42.213]  07.
[01:26:42.213 --> 01:26:44.454]  See, there's thousands of points.
[01:26:44.454 --> 01:26:49.816]  They really plan on finally conquering America by internal civil war.
[01:26:49.816 --> 01:26:52.457]  It's the only way America could be brought down.
[01:26:52.457 --> 01:26:54.618]  And they're really looking at doing it.
[01:26:54.618 --> 01:26:57.119]  These globalists are bold, folks.
[01:26:57.119 --> 01:27:00.680]  So, if you believe they won't do it, they're going to do it.
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:03.801]  If you really freak out, and we should talk about solutions,
[01:27:05.896 --> 01:27:07.196]  Because I'm risking my life doing this.
[01:27:07.196 --> 01:27:09.537]  I'm not doing this to lose.
[01:27:09.537 --> 01:27:12.658]  I want to beat these people.
[01:27:12.658 --> 01:27:13.278]  God.
[01:27:13.278 --> 01:27:14.638]  Okay, I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:27:14.638 --> 01:27:17.319]  It's just, folks, I'm not saying this for hyperbole.
[01:27:17.319 --> 01:27:18.579]  This isn't just what I believe.
[01:27:18.579 --> 01:27:19.420]  It's what I know.
[01:27:19.420 --> 01:27:21.240]  I study history.
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:22.621]  I'm obsessed with it.
[01:27:22.621 --> 01:27:23.881]  This is guaranteed.
[01:27:23.881 --> 01:27:29.902]  Do you understand that they've initiated the program?
[01:27:29.902 --> 01:27:31.443]  The train is rolling down the track.
[01:27:32.438 --> 01:27:36.660]  We don't have long to put the brakes on this thing before it's point and overturn.
[01:27:36.660 --> 01:27:39.702]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up.
[01:27:39.702 --> 01:27:44.244]  Toll free number to join us, 800-259-9231 for police and military.
[01:27:44.244 --> 01:27:46.405]  Let's talk to Sean in Iowa, who's a police officer.
[01:27:46.405 --> 01:27:47.366]  This is a short segment.
[01:27:47.366 --> 01:27:49.167]  I'll get to everybody in the next segment.
[01:27:49.167 --> 01:27:50.287]  Sean, do you disagree with me?
[01:27:50.287 --> 01:27:50.887]  Do you agree?
[01:27:50.887 --> 01:27:51.748]  What are you being told?
[01:27:51.748 --> 01:27:55.010]  No, I actually completely agree with you and
[01:27:57.213 --> 01:28:00.575]  I mean, people better wake up because it's coming.
[01:28:00.575 --> 01:28:09.138]  I read an article on SteveQuail.com on the 25th, just the other day, with an interview with the Department of Homeland Security Insider.
[01:28:09.138 --> 01:28:13.660]  Sent that to a couple cop buddies, took it as a grain of salt initially.
[01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:23.664]  My other buddy sent it to one of the patrol commanders, who then turns around and tells him that he's got a buddy who used to be at DHS who was an assistant director, and
[01:28:25.834 --> 01:28:28.837]  He says, in that article, it's everything that he's being told.
[01:28:28.837 --> 01:28:38.028]  That they're coming to take guns, they're gonna quiet all the squeaky wheel cops, um, just, I mean, it's, it's intense.
[01:28:39.378 --> 01:28:47.322]  Exactly, and of course you're talking about Quayle is reporting on a Doug Hagman Northeast Intelligence Network report that I happen to have up at Infowars.com.
[01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:50.943]  I think I'm going to have this reposted right now to the front page.
[01:28:50.943 --> 01:28:52.044]  Here's the problem.
[01:28:52.044 --> 01:28:55.245]  This dovetails with everything that's open intelligence.
[01:28:55.245 --> 01:28:58.667]  Everything in this is already right in front of me in the news.
[01:28:58.667 --> 01:29:02.649]  See, when they start hiding something in plain view, what does that mean?
[01:29:04.622 --> 01:29:12.767]  Well, they know that nobody reads the newspapers or even takes five minutes out of their day to surf through the internet and at least read headlines.
[01:29:12.767 --> 01:29:14.148]  I mean, it's there for you.
[01:29:14.148 --> 01:29:16.029]  It's free.
[01:29:16.029 --> 01:29:17.730]  It's information.
[01:29:17.730 --> 01:29:20.471]  People are more concerned with Dancing with the Stars, though.
[01:29:20.471 --> 01:29:21.031]  I agree with you.
[01:29:21.031 --> 01:29:22.732]  I want you to stay there and come back in two more minutes.
[01:29:22.732 --> 01:29:24.273]  Can you do that?
[01:29:24.273 --> 01:29:24.814]  Yeah, I can do that.
[01:29:24.814 --> 01:29:29.596]  Okay, stay there, and then I promise I'll get to Dave and Carl and John and everybody else that's holding.
[01:29:29.596 --> 01:29:31.097]  But listen to me carefully.
[01:29:31.097 --> 01:29:32.158]  The officer got part of it.
[01:29:33.516 --> 01:29:42.720]  When they decloak, to use the Star Trek analogy of a Klingon bird of prey, that's when they're firing.
[01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:47.422]  They're going public with all this because they're dropping the hammer, folks.
[01:29:47.422 --> 01:29:48.162]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:48.162 --> 01:29:50.983]  Remember all those years we told you this was coming?
[01:29:50.983 --> 01:29:52.384]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.384 --> 01:29:54.925]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.925 --> 01:29:57.586]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.829 --> 01:30:11.792]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms, but if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[01:30:11.792 --> 01:30:15.773]  When you're sleeping, who's watching out for intruders and spooks?

[01:31:02.495 --> 01:31:08.353]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.

[01:32:02.867 --> 01:32:08.451]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[01:32:08.451 --> 01:32:11.693]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[01:32:11.693 --> 01:32:14.495]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[01:32:14.495 --> 01:32:17.517]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[01:32:17.517 --> 01:32:20.519]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[01:32:21.019 --> 01:32:26.225]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[01:32:26.225 --> 01:32:28.909]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.
[01:32:28.909 --> 01:32:32.573]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[01:32:32.573 --> 01:32:36.818]  I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.
[01:32:36.818 --> 01:32:39.962]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials.
[01:32:40.242 --> 01:32:44.647]  And you can start with a holiday gift pack that's normally $80, now under $50.

[01:32:52.635 --> 01:32:55.758]  Would you rather prepare six months too early or one day too late?
[01:32:55.758 --> 01:32:57.360]  409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:33:03.484 --> 01:33:09.946]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:09.946 --> 01:33:11.726]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:11.726 --> 01:33:13.367]  Ladies and gentlemen, you've seen
[01:33:33.464 --> 01:33:46.546]  News reports where CNN, you name it, will talk about where Obama's daughters are vacationing with the president and they will shut down the CNN story.
[01:33:46.546 --> 01:33:47.467]  They'll be removed.
[01:33:47.467 --> 01:33:50.607]  The media on its own will go around and expunge it.
[01:33:50.607 --> 01:33:56.808]  We have a Facebook with 338,000 likes that was a fan Facebook.
[01:33:56.808 --> 01:33:59.349]  We have dozens, over a million likes total.
[01:33:59.349 --> 01:34:00.489]  This was the biggest channel.
[01:34:01.391 --> 01:34:05.433]  And we can actually punch it up on screen at Infowars.com.
[01:34:05.433 --> 01:34:09.156]  I want to show viewers first up there on my screen.
[01:34:09.156 --> 01:34:24.444]  And we sent out a video dealing with the fact that I haven't even gotten to yet, I'm going to go to your calls first, that David Gregory and others have armed guards for their children, but they're saying that you shouldn't have any armed guards or police at your school.
[01:34:24.444 --> 01:34:25.145]  And here it is.
[01:34:25.145 --> 01:34:26.886]  This feature is temporarily blocked.
[01:34:27.686 --> 01:34:43.122]  Our social network lady, Christy, came and showed this to us for a video I did on YouTube that they won't let us share, talking about how Obama and David Gregory have armed guards for their kids at school, but they say you shouldn't.
[01:34:43.122 --> 01:34:44.523]  They actually say you shouldn't.
[01:34:44.523 --> 01:34:45.604]  That's wrong.
[01:34:45.604 --> 01:34:47.586]  Just advertise the schools as a mass shooting ground.
[01:34:50.017 --> 01:34:55.001]  They say we're blocked for 19 hours, that no one can like it, no one can get our stuff.
[01:34:55.001 --> 01:34:56.702]  And see, why should I even promote Facebook?
[01:34:56.702 --> 01:35:04.128]  Well, we've used it as a way to get the word out, but this is all part of the censorship that we're going into.
[01:35:05.535 --> 01:35:11.016]  It says, you recently posted something that violates Facebook policies, so you're temporarily blocked from using the feature.
[01:35:11.016 --> 01:35:12.096]  Learn more!
[01:35:12.096 --> 01:35:17.637]  To keep from getting blocked again, please make sure you've read and understand Facebook's Community Standards.
[01:35:17.637 --> 01:35:21.398]  The last time this happened to us, they said, you know, you're not supposed to be political.
[01:35:21.398 --> 01:35:24.158]  That's not how you make friends.
[01:35:24.158 --> 01:35:34.060]  So not only does Facebook say they own your content, and the head of it calls you dumb effers, because you, quote, trust him, you're not allowed to talk bad about Lord Obama.
[01:35:35.242 --> 01:35:37.566]  See, these people are authoritarians.
[01:35:37.566 --> 01:35:38.928]  We need to get a report on this.
[01:35:38.928 --> 01:35:39.949]  Paul Watson needs to do one.
[01:35:39.949 --> 01:35:41.512]  This is a big deal.
[01:35:41.512 --> 01:35:48.062]  Because if you go through and learn more of why it happened, they are flagging our latest post that is the Obama video.
[01:35:49.250 --> 01:35:53.796]  All we did was put up the headline, Obama's daughters go to school with 11 armed guards.
[01:35:53.796 --> 01:36:04.229]  Not allowed to have a video about that, which was a link to DrudgeReport.com covering it and Breitbart.com covering it and the Washington Post covering it.
[01:36:04.229 --> 01:36:06.411]  I shot a video last night at 11 o'clock at night.
[01:36:07.210 --> 01:36:09.392]  All right, I'm going to shut up and go to the police and others that are holding.
[01:36:09.392 --> 01:36:11.674]  I'm going to shut up.
[01:36:11.674 --> 01:36:26.346]  Sean, so you saw the Northeast Intelligence Network report about a high-level DHS person, and I've got my own sources, but I think Doug Hagman is a good source, you know, saying, hey, the hammer's getting dropped, they're coming after the guns.
[01:36:26.346 --> 01:36:28.047]  Well, that's in the news.
[01:36:28.047 --> 01:36:35.494]  They want to cause a civil war, and you put this up the chain and, again, repeat without me interrupting you exactly what you were told in your department.
[01:36:37.203 --> 01:36:45.549]  Um, basically one of the lieutenants who's the ship commander, um, came back to us after I had sent the email to a couple other officers.
[01:36:45.549 --> 01:36:55.356]  Um, he just reiterated the fact that he goes, this is exactly everything that I've been told and it's like my buddy was telling me that this is what's going to happen.
[01:36:55.356 --> 01:36:58.599]  Um, I mean, it's something that I didn't already know.
[01:36:58.599 --> 01:37:02.882]  It's just a different form in an interview from an anonymous source.
[01:37:02.882 --> 01:37:05.564]  So to get it actually validated like that is pretty,
[01:37:06.892 --> 01:37:12.176]  Pretty huge, uh, from his buddy who was, uh, again, an assistant director at Homeland Security.
[01:37:12.176 --> 01:37:22.985]  So, and we get, uh, you know, we get DHS information all the time on things, and he was telling me yesterday, he goes upstairs to one of the captains, and he's just like, are you getting this stuff?
[01:37:22.985 --> 01:37:25.347]  Like, what the heck is this?
[01:37:25.347 --> 01:37:26.227]  What's going on here?
[01:37:26.227 --> 01:37:32.472]  And, yeah, I mean, I would say in our department, it's probably about 50-50 a week right now.
[01:37:34.218 --> 01:37:45.125]  A lot of guys, the whole gun grabbing thing that's going on now, with the magazine ammo shortage, nobody can get any guns, that's really got some people, that really grabbed them by the collar and shook them awake.
[01:37:45.125 --> 01:37:53.090]  So, you know, now it's kind of like, well you've gone, now I've gone from being the crazy guy to, man, he's right.
[01:37:53.090 --> 01:37:55.832]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:37:55.832 --> 01:37:56.933]  Because again, these aren't liberals.
[01:37:56.933 --> 01:37:58.354]  Everything they do is military style.
[01:37:58.354 --> 01:38:01.116]  We'll never take your guns while admitting they want our guns.
[01:38:01.116 --> 01:38:02.657]  They play these mind games with people.
[01:38:04.178 --> 01:38:10.123]  There is no doubt they are preparing for a civil war and they plan to use the police to start it.
[01:38:10.123 --> 01:38:13.506]  And again, most police aren't going to go out and take people's guns.
[01:38:13.506 --> 01:38:14.087]  They don't care.
[01:38:14.087 --> 01:38:15.648]  They're going to have special units do it.
[01:38:15.648 --> 01:38:20.553]  These little federalized special event SWAT teams they set up to trigger it.
[01:38:21.730 --> 01:38:28.655]  And I just want the police to know, if they trick you guys into pulling off a couple of WACOs, it is going to be very bad.
[01:38:28.655 --> 01:38:30.996]  Because the globalists think they're smart.
[01:38:30.996 --> 01:38:33.878]  They are masters at playing us off against each other.
[01:38:33.878 --> 01:38:41.904]  I hope everybody gets this is a plan, and that Obama can then act as a savior and bring in a total gun ban out of what is about to happen.
[01:38:41.904 --> 01:38:47.147]  Because again, all the scripting has never been about Al Qaeda that they run, which is now public.
[01:38:47.147 --> 01:38:49.168]  It's all about a civil war.
[01:38:49.168 --> 01:38:50.970]  So I hope police understand that
[01:38:52.311 --> 01:38:55.978]  This isn't a war that you're supposed to win or the people are supposed to win.
[01:38:55.978 --> 01:38:58.723]  They all see us in the same group.
[01:38:59.718 --> 01:39:02.700]  I hope that message gets through to police right now.
[01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:10.566]  I hope police are smart enough to understand this is an un-executable operation and it's illegal.
[01:39:10.566 --> 01:39:12.267]  Do you concur with that analysis?
[01:39:12.267 --> 01:39:16.870]  A. And B. What's the word on gun confiscations?
[01:39:16.870 --> 01:39:21.534]  I mean, if they tell you to do it, what are the police you talk to saying?
[01:39:23.007 --> 01:39:45.772]  I do agree that you are correct, and I have personally asked a lot of people, I work in a larger department in the state, and a lot of us have come to the point, I mean I'm talking like ship commanders, actual like people in charge, to where I said, hey, you know, we didn't think a lot of this other stuff was going to pass, but it did.
[01:39:48.223 --> 01:39:48.743]  Oh, I know.
[01:39:48.743 --> 01:39:49.103]  I know.
[01:40:18.496 --> 01:40:22.203]  People, we are the most visible arm of the government.
[01:40:22.813 --> 01:40:27.054]  So people equate what happens through, say, the federal government to your local police department.
[01:40:27.054 --> 01:40:27.654]  That's right.
[01:40:27.654 --> 01:40:30.495]  You're going to get the blame for all of this.
[01:40:30.495 --> 01:40:32.375]  And again, most of you are probably veterans.
[01:40:32.375 --> 01:40:38.757]  Again, they admit their enemy is the veterans because they know you're the people that know how to fight.
[01:40:38.757 --> 01:40:47.499]  And any authoritarian system gets rid of the current police group and intelligence group and enforcement security service group that was in previously.
[01:40:47.499 --> 01:40:49.519]  That's 101 from history.
[01:40:49.519 --> 01:40:51.580]  God bless you and I appreciate you calling in today, sir.
[01:40:53.314 --> 01:40:56.916]  I don't know what to say at this point.
[01:40:56.916 --> 01:40:57.877]  I know it's reckless.
[01:40:57.877 --> 01:40:59.117]  I know it's crazy.
[01:40:59.117 --> 01:41:02.559]  Every indicator is they're going to go ahead and go ahead with this.
[01:41:02.559 --> 01:41:03.720]  I want to tell the police something.
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:05.141]  Don't just quit.
[01:41:05.141 --> 01:41:05.881]  Speak out.
[01:41:05.881 --> 01:41:09.063]  Tell your unions to say no.
[01:41:09.063 --> 01:41:11.664]  Demand police chiefs that aren't traitors.
[01:41:11.664 --> 01:41:13.005]  Call your statehouse.
[01:41:13.005 --> 01:41:13.966]  Leak information.
[01:41:13.966 --> 01:41:15.467]  It's your right and duty.
[01:41:15.467 --> 01:41:21.310]  When you get Homeland Security reports demonizing gun owners and saying they're the new terrorists, it's your job to put that out.
[01:41:22.878 --> 01:41:25.000]  Through channels like InfoWars.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.842]  We have showtips at InfoWars.com.
[01:41:27.842 --> 01:41:28.983]  Send it to us there.
[01:41:28.983 --> 01:41:31.045]  We'll vet it and we'll put it out.
[01:41:31.045 --> 01:41:36.049]  We've got to fight this politically before it goes physical.
[01:41:36.049 --> 01:41:40.093]  The globalists are losing the political fight.
[01:41:40.093 --> 01:41:44.777]  It's like playing a card game and somebody's winning fair and square so somebody else starts a fight.
[01:41:44.777 --> 01:41:47.879]  We're winning politically fair and square.
[01:41:47.879 --> 01:41:48.540]  So they're cheating.
[01:41:50.316 --> 01:41:54.738]  I mean, it's real simple, and they want to get... I know I keep saying it.
[01:41:54.738 --> 01:41:58.339]  Let's go to Dave in Kentucky.
[01:41:58.339 --> 01:41:59.360]  Dave, you're on the air.
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:02.021]  You're Army, listening on shortwave.
[01:42:02.021 --> 01:42:03.141]  Do you agree with what I've been saying?
[01:42:03.141 --> 01:42:03.741]  Do you disagree?
[01:42:03.741 --> 01:42:06.202]  Do you have points to add?
[01:42:06.202 --> 01:42:09.444]  I do agree, Alex, and I think a few things need to be addressed.
[01:42:09.444 --> 01:42:17.167]  First off, I seem to... there's a disturbing trend of apathy starting to develop in a lot of my active duty.
[01:42:18.140 --> 01:42:21.381]  Former active duty buddies and stuff like that.
[01:42:21.381 --> 01:42:23.622]  Wide awake, they listen to your show.
[01:42:23.622 --> 01:42:31.564]  But the problem is, it gets to the point where, you know, like Sandy Hook happening, and then we're all saying to each other, look, they're going to do it again.
[01:42:31.564 --> 01:42:32.684]  Something else is going to happen.
[01:42:32.684 --> 01:42:33.265]  Wait for it.
[01:42:33.265 --> 01:42:35.705]  And now we got the firefighters being killed.
[01:42:35.705 --> 01:42:40.987]  And so it's at the point, it's like, okay, we can pretty much call the shots just as Alex is calling the shots.
[01:42:41.977 --> 01:42:44.460]  They're starting to get disheartened, like, what's the point?
[01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:44.840]  You know?
[01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:47.083]  Because... Okay, well let me tell them the point.
[01:42:47.083 --> 01:42:48.144]  Let me tell them the point.
[01:42:48.144 --> 01:42:51.288]  They're not planning just some socialist takeover like Europe.
[01:42:51.288 --> 01:42:53.731]  They already did the re-education with Hitler over there.
[01:42:53.731 --> 01:42:56.854]  They're planning a full takeover in America.
[01:42:56.854 --> 01:43:00.118]  I mean, I hope people get, folks, they're gonna gut everything.
[01:43:00.819 --> 01:43:05.920]  They're going to raise taxes so high that you're going to live in a 250 square foot box.
[01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:07.821]  They're going to tell you what to eat.
[01:43:07.821 --> 01:43:10.202]  They're going to make you take in inoculations.
[01:43:10.202 --> 01:43:15.623]  I hope people get, they plan a full collapse of America if they can get away with it.
[01:43:15.623 --> 01:43:17.884]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:43:17.884 --> 01:43:23.966]  Yes, and shifting gears, back in the summer I had a buddy who's in a National Guard company out on the East Coast.
[01:43:25.365 --> 01:43:30.227]  They had a drill where they were conducting training over resettlement operations.
[01:43:30.227 --> 01:43:36.529]  And I've edited it myself just because I was able to get a hold of the PowerPoint presentation that they were using to teach it.
[01:43:36.529 --> 01:43:48.972]  So, I mean, back then, this was, you know, late in the summer, so it was, the pretext was, you know, say, all hell breaks loose because of riots over the outcome of the election or anything like that.
[01:43:48.972 --> 01:43:53.154]  Yeah, like I said, they used that as the cover for martial law drills last year.
[01:43:53.154 --> 01:43:53.414]  Go ahead.
[01:43:55.080 --> 01:44:07.909]  Yeah, so I can definitely say that, and talking to a lot of my buddies, both active duty and National Guard, they're training for it, not so much my unit, but it's real.
[01:44:07.909 --> 01:44:14.794]  And I just want to say out to all my military brothers out there, please don't lose heart.
[01:44:14.794 --> 01:44:16.355]  You know, it is important.
[01:44:16.355 --> 01:44:16.956]  You do matter.
[01:44:17.927 --> 01:44:19.948]  And just stay the course.
[01:44:19.948 --> 01:44:21.328]  No, I hear you, but let me say this.
[01:44:21.328 --> 01:44:27.210]  You shouldn't get disheartened by having PowerPoints where it talks about locking down cities and taking guns.
[01:44:27.210 --> 01:44:29.271]  We have the PDF.
[01:44:29.271 --> 01:44:30.791]  I mean, it's official.
[01:44:30.791 --> 01:44:36.193]  By the way, if it's not classified, I believe it's only... Is that classified, that PowerPoint?
[01:44:38.902 --> 01:44:43.665]  Yeah, well you need to send that on our way, because people need to actually see the maps.
[01:44:43.665 --> 01:44:56.993]  I mean, I've already been to urban warfare drills, where I've already seen the proto-development of it, but the, you know, the coordinating, the taking over the media, the power plant, then the block to block, then how to deal with the, because in the drills they have the folks beg to be in the camp.
[01:44:56.993 --> 01:45:00.196]  That's to create the psychological illusion that what you're doing is good.
[01:45:00.196 --> 01:45:02.197]  I mean, it's all meant to just sell you on the idea.
[01:45:02.637 --> 01:45:04.337]  But people need to see this.
[01:45:04.337 --> 01:45:11.639]  But how is it demoralizing people to know that they're training to put Americans in FEMA camps?
[01:45:11.639 --> 01:45:15.901]  That should make people gung-ho to be getting the word out and resisting it.
[01:45:15.901 --> 01:45:16.841]  I don't understand.
[01:45:16.841 --> 01:45:18.621]  How does that demoralize us?
[01:45:18.621 --> 01:45:19.962]  That should get everybody geared up.
[01:45:19.962 --> 01:45:22.262]  We've got an enemy that's come in and taken over.
[01:45:22.262 --> 01:45:23.142]  They're illegitimate.
[01:45:23.142 --> 01:45:24.783]  We need to use this information against them.
[01:45:25.203 --> 01:45:27.785]  This information will destroy the enemy!
[01:45:27.785 --> 01:45:33.289]  That's why they want to get into a physical conflict now, because our info war is really hurting them!
[01:45:33.289 --> 01:45:36.852]  Hello?
[01:45:36.852 --> 01:45:37.613]  You there?
[01:45:37.613 --> 01:45:37.913]  Yes, sir.
[01:45:37.913 --> 01:45:38.753]  Do you hear what I'm saying?
[01:45:38.753 --> 01:45:39.474]  I mean, do you agree?
[01:45:39.474 --> 01:45:40.395]  Do you understand what I'm saying?
[01:45:40.395 --> 01:45:41.516]  Yes.
[01:45:41.516 --> 01:45:45.198]  I agree, and I'm on the same sheet of music as you.
[01:45:45.198 --> 01:45:53.605]  What I think, where the position these guys are coming from, is they look at society and, you know, what the media is popularizing and things like that, and they think, you know,
[01:45:54.631 --> 01:45:57.793]  I'm fighting for this.
[01:45:57.793 --> 01:46:00.195]  I think they get, they pay attention to the wrong things.
[01:46:00.195 --> 01:46:01.816]  They don't look at the whole picture.
[01:46:01.816 --> 01:46:04.017]  They don't look at the things that you guys are putting out.
[01:46:04.017 --> 01:46:06.879]  They just, too many of them pay attention to the mainstream.
[01:46:06.879 --> 01:46:16.186]  No sir, when I see yuppies acting arrogant and I see the MTV bilge and the gangster rap, it makes me think, why am I fighting for America?
[01:46:16.186 --> 01:46:19.788]  Do you understand if you read Soviet warfare manuals that were declassified in the 70s,
[01:46:21.349 --> 01:46:24.872]  I think it's one of them is called 40 points for Soviet infiltration.
[01:46:24.872 --> 01:46:26.293]  Can you guys find that?
[01:46:26.293 --> 01:46:27.875]  It's everything you see now.
[01:46:27.875 --> 01:46:29.496]  This is all done on purpose.
[01:46:29.496 --> 01:46:36.062]  I've talked to MTV executives, okay, who were there in the 90s when they were openly saying this in board meetings.
[01:46:36.902 --> 01:46:40.284]  MTV isn't demoralizing on accident, sir.
[01:46:40.284 --> 01:46:44.966]  They know good people get hurt by this.
[01:46:44.966 --> 01:46:49.788]  And listen, that is cobra poison they're pumping into us.
[01:46:49.788 --> 01:46:53.389]  Have you seen Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers?
[01:46:53.389 --> 01:46:54.370]  Absolutely, I have.
[01:46:54.370 --> 01:47:05.815]  Okay, so you've seen when the King of Rowan is sitting there thinking he's old, he's under the spell with Warmer Grimewood or whatever his name is, whispering into his ear, but Gandalf breaks the spell and the guy gets up and feels his strength?
[01:47:07.042 --> 01:47:07.622]  Yes.
[01:47:07.622 --> 01:47:09.263]  That's exactly what America's under.
[01:47:09.263 --> 01:47:13.004]  We are literally under a propaganda brainwashing spell.
[01:47:13.004 --> 01:47:14.905]  The general public is in a trance.
[01:47:14.905 --> 01:47:20.307]  It doesn't matter if they've got 55% of people sucking their thumbs thinking everything's funny.
[01:47:20.307 --> 01:47:21.928]  Those people don't count.
[01:47:21.928 --> 01:47:22.928]  They've never counted.
[01:47:22.928 --> 01:47:24.989]  3% is always what's counted.
[01:47:25.979 --> 01:47:29.161]  You understand they're going to come and they're coming after us.
[01:47:29.161 --> 01:47:30.102]  We don't have a choice.
[01:47:30.102 --> 01:47:31.562]  They know who we are.
[01:47:31.562 --> 01:47:33.944]  People say, I'm afraid to sign a petition, they'll come get me.
[01:47:33.944 --> 01:47:35.725]  They already know who you are.
[01:47:35.725 --> 01:47:37.086]  You're dead!
[01:47:37.086 --> 01:47:40.007]  They plan to put 50 million of us in re-education camps.
[01:47:40.007 --> 01:47:41.969]  That came out in the FBI files.
[01:47:41.969 --> 01:47:43.850]  The only hope is beating these people.
[01:47:43.850 --> 01:47:45.531]  They're not backing off.
[01:47:45.531 --> 01:47:46.491]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[01:47:46.491 --> 01:47:50.293]  We don't have any hope unless we get up and stomp them.
[01:47:50.293 --> 01:47:52.355]  The only hope is going through these people.
[01:47:52.975 --> 01:47:55.898]  God bless you, I appreciate your call and I know what you're saying.
[01:47:55.898 --> 01:47:59.782]  Let me tell you, don't watch the enemy propaganda.
[01:47:59.782 --> 01:48:05.568]  I have to watch it to analyze it and it hurts me, I understand, but it's an enemy operation.
[01:48:05.568 --> 01:48:08.751]  And you cannot let them get you.
[01:48:08.751 --> 01:48:11.855]  Listen, let me tell you, this is a gamble by these people.
[01:48:12.745 --> 01:48:14.626]  This is a big gamble.
[01:48:14.626 --> 01:48:16.568]  Let's say they crush us in the first wave.
[01:48:16.568 --> 01:48:18.169]  Let's say they kill me.
[01:48:18.169 --> 01:48:19.350]  Drag me off and torture me.
[01:48:19.350 --> 01:48:22.652]  Roll me out as some brain-damaged robot.
[01:48:22.652 --> 01:48:23.372]  It doesn't matter.
[01:48:23.372 --> 01:48:25.614]  The people know the truth.
[01:48:25.614 --> 01:48:27.555]  God knows the truth.
[01:48:27.555 --> 01:48:34.800]  Listen, they can't defeat us unless we buy into their propaganda that we're defeated.
[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:35.801]  We have the victory.
[01:48:35.801 --> 01:48:36.802]  They're scum.
[01:48:36.802 --> 01:48:38.383]  There's only a few thousand globalists.
[01:48:39.602 --> 01:48:41.804]  They operate in darkness, we operate in the light.
[01:48:41.804 --> 01:48:42.965]  We're gonna win.
[01:48:42.965 --> 01:48:45.587]  John in California, US Navy, what's your take on this?
[01:48:45.587 --> 01:48:47.209]  How you doing Alex?
[01:48:47.209 --> 01:48:48.109]  Good.
[01:48:48.109 --> 01:48:50.251]  I just called to talk to you about the mood.
[01:48:51.486 --> 01:48:59.712]  Uh, amongst, uh, people here that I work with, uh, active duty military, uh, civilian federal employees, and, uh, and retired people.
[01:48:59.712 --> 01:49:08.137]  Ever since, uh, the shooting in Sandy, uh, it's been everybody here that I work around, uh, has said, you know what?
[01:49:08.137 --> 01:49:13.301]  If, uh, if we gotta turn in our guns to, uh, stop killing these kids, then that's fine.
[01:49:14.960 --> 01:49:16.360]  And I just, you know, I can't believe it.
[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:19.882]  You know, there's other military that call in and say, hey, they're not going to do this.
[01:49:19.882 --> 01:49:25.325]  But I'm on a base with, you know, there's like 30,000 people on this base every day.
[01:49:25.325 --> 01:49:31.089]  And everybody I come in contact with says... Well, I'm not going to knock the Navy, but that's the Navy's history.
[01:49:31.089 --> 01:49:32.910]  I mean, the Navy comes out of martial law.
[01:49:34.330 --> 01:49:41.934]  And that's just the culture of the Navy, of a ship, of the captain being God, and that's what you expect.
[01:49:41.934 --> 01:49:43.174]  And you know what?
[01:49:43.174 --> 01:49:49.697]  Let them lick down and, you know, crouch down and lick the hand that feeds them, may their chains sit lightly upon them.
[01:49:49.697 --> 01:49:56.400]  If they really think giving the guns up for 20 dead kids when thousands die every year in the bathtub...
[01:49:58.081 --> 01:50:02.945]  The globalists are savagely exploiting this, disgustingly obviously.
[01:50:02.945 --> 01:50:08.110]  I mean, how brain-numb are these people there in the Navy?
[01:50:08.110 --> 01:50:13.975]  I don't know, but it just disgusts me.
[01:50:13.975 --> 01:50:15.436]  I can't believe it.
[01:50:15.436 --> 01:50:20.600]  I'm the crazy guy at work who has InfoWars stickers on my car.
[01:50:22.970 --> 01:50:27.251]  People just, they think, you know what, we should give up our guns to, uh, just, you know, stop.
[01:50:27.251 --> 01:50:29.331]  Yeah, well you counter people like that going, oh really?
[01:50:29.331 --> 01:50:31.172]  Why do these media people have armed guards?
[01:50:31.172 --> 01:50:40.194]  Why does, why does, uh, why does the self-propelled stomach, uh, Michael Moore have like six armed guards at all times?
[01:50:40.194 --> 01:50:40.634]  Right.
[01:50:40.634 --> 01:50:44.415]  I mean, why are, why is crime, violent crime dropping because of gun ownership?
[01:50:44.415 --> 01:50:46.395]  Anything else you want to add with that report, sir?
[01:50:47.238 --> 01:50:49.001]  Yes, it was about six months ago.
[01:50:49.001 --> 01:50:54.813]  We had a meeting with enlisted people and a high-ranking person.
[01:50:54.813 --> 01:50:56.136]  I want to hear this when we come back.
[01:50:56.136 --> 01:50:56.537]  Stay there.
[01:50:56.537 --> 01:50:57.058]  I want to hear it.
[01:50:57.058 --> 01:50:57.378]  Don't go.
[01:51:00.882 --> 01:51:07.044]  HempUSA.org has a newly designed website and a new and improved detoxification product.

[01:51:30.595 --> 01:51:31.836]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:51:31.836 --> 01:51:36.399]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:51:36.399 --> 01:51:42.203]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:51:42.203 --> 01:51:45.845]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:51:45.845 --> 01:51:50.729]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:51:50.729 --> 01:51:53.630]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:51:53.630 --> 01:51:53.931]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:51:53.931 --> 01:51:55.272]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:52:00.655 --> 01:52:01.656]  Hi there.
[01:52:01.656 --> 01:52:03.197]  My name is Frank Bates.
[01:52:03.197 --> 01:52:07.039]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[01:52:07.039 --> 01:52:16.186]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[01:52:16.186 --> 01:52:22.890]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[01:52:22.890 --> 01:52:25.091]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[01:52:25.091 --> 01:52:30.175]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[01:52:30.935 --> 01:52:38.878]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[01:52:38.878 --> 01:52:44.460]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patrons have already seen in the last three months.
[01:52:44.460 --> 01:52:50.962]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[01:52:50.962 --> 01:52:56.724]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[01:52:56.724 --> 01:52:57.884]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[01:53:00.373 --> 01:53:05.135]  We can buy GMOs stressed out about money and blasted by the electric environment.
[01:53:05.135 --> 01:53:09.456]  Hi, I'm Pastor Jenny and that was the state I was in back in 2010.
[01:53:09.456 --> 01:53:11.657]  Then I learned about RNA drops.
[01:53:11.657 --> 01:53:21.281]  I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have called junk is actually packed with millions of gene switches that play a critical role in how my cells, organs,
[01:53:21.621 --> 01:53:21.701]  Yeah!
[01:53:42.020 --> 01:53:49.089]  That's rnafreesample.com or call toll-free 888-577-3703.
[01:53:49.089 --> 01:53:53.014]  Pay only shipping and handling for a free 30-day supply of RNA drops.
[01:53:53.014 --> 01:53:57.760]  Get the information you need and the health you want at rnafreesample.com.
[01:54:17.938 --> 01:54:26.342]  By the way, we've logged into our Facebook and we're getting a screenshot of the image that they showed us that has been banned.
[01:54:26.342 --> 01:54:28.022]  We just got contacted by Mike Adams.
[01:54:28.022 --> 01:54:29.963]  He's going to be in studio with me tomorrow here.
[01:54:29.963 --> 01:54:32.804]  And this is the image for TV viewers.
[01:54:32.804 --> 01:54:39.187]  I'm going to repost this to Infowars.com in an article that I'm going to have Paul Watson or Steve Watson do.
[01:54:39.187 --> 01:54:43.529]  Among the many misdeeds the British rule in India history will look upon, the act of depriving
[01:54:44.389 --> 01:54:46.731]  A whole nation of arms as the blackest.
[01:54:46.731 --> 01:54:49.193]  Mahatma Gandhi, an autobiography, page 446.
[01:54:49.193 --> 01:54:52.276]  We gotta show a document cam shot of this.
[01:54:52.276 --> 01:54:54.478]  I wanna show the viewers this.
[01:54:54.478 --> 01:54:56.660]  People that are watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:54:56.660 --> 01:54:58.221]  So Mike Adams put that out.
[01:54:58.221 --> 01:54:59.262]  I put out a video.
[01:55:00.615 --> 01:55:08.198]  Showing that David Gregory has armed guards for his kids at their private school while he's saying you shouldn't.
[01:55:08.198 --> 01:55:10.819]  And they said we're locked out of our Facebook.
[01:55:10.819 --> 01:55:13.100]  So, I mean, this is incredible censorship.
[01:55:13.100 --> 01:55:15.361]  You cannot quote Mahatma Gandhi.
[01:55:16.209 --> 01:55:17.130]  This is a big article.
[01:55:17.130 --> 01:55:18.071]  This is big news.
[01:55:18.071 --> 01:55:21.113]  People need to know that, I mean, it's on, folks.
[01:55:21.113 --> 01:55:24.236]  They're not going to let us defend ourselves.
[01:55:24.236 --> 01:55:26.538]  They're taking the gun shows off TV.
[01:55:26.538 --> 01:55:30.142]  Gun shows are already shutting down to their own accord.
[01:55:30.142 --> 01:55:36.568]  Companies aren't selling guns now, like Dick's Sporting Goods and others, cheaper than dirt, because the word's gone out.
[01:55:37.208 --> 01:55:44.274]  The New World Order is shutting down the guns and Dianne Feinstein says she's working with the President to make you turn your guns in.
[01:55:44.274 --> 01:55:49.998]  Or, if you're lucky, just go give fingerprints and register your guns.
[01:55:49.998 --> 01:55:52.660]  Which they always do before confiscation.
[01:55:52.660 --> 01:55:55.582]  And then they'll stage another shooting or let another shooting take place.
[01:55:55.582 --> 01:55:57.544]  It's so incredible how they do this.
[01:55:57.544 --> 01:55:58.625]  Alright.
[01:55:58.625 --> 01:55:59.705]  I'm just totally upset right now.
[01:56:00.782 --> 01:56:11.012]  You better just get the word out about Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and all my films online and the Obama deception and everything else because it's not going to be there much longer.
[01:56:11.012 --> 01:56:13.775]  They're going for broke!
[01:56:13.775 --> 01:56:14.595]  You know, the good news is...
[01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:17.731]  I got a bunch of new affiliates.
[01:56:17.731 --> 01:56:20.813]  KYAH 540 AM, Delta, Utah.
[01:56:20.813 --> 01:56:23.415]  I want to plug this properly later.
[01:56:23.415 --> 01:56:24.316]  WPIQ 92.7, Michigan.
[01:56:24.316 --> 01:56:25.097]  How do you pronounce that?
[01:56:25.097 --> 01:56:26.358]  Manistique, Michigan.
[01:56:34.186 --> 01:56:42.993]  WMEL 1300 AM, Melbourne Cocoa Beach, and KMJ 580 AM, Fresno, California, 50,000 watt.
[01:56:42.993 --> 01:56:47.117]  I think I've already plugged that one last week, but I got a couple more from last week I didn't plug.
[01:56:47.117 --> 01:56:48.338]  Can I have last week's?
[01:56:48.338 --> 01:56:48.638]  Thanks.
[01:56:48.638 --> 01:56:52.701]  I mean, this is just, it's, listen, this is real, folks.
[01:56:52.701 --> 01:56:55.163]  People are like, well, I guess we'll turn our guns into them.
[01:56:55.163 --> 01:56:57.565]  That's part of the enslavement program.
[01:56:57.565 --> 01:57:00.908]  They're gonna take all your money and your pension funds.
[01:57:02.737 --> 01:57:04.939]  And that's not to prop up the economy.
[01:57:04.939 --> 01:57:08.402]  They plan to go over the fiscal cliff to bankrupt us on purpose.
[01:57:08.402 --> 01:57:11.524]  They know when they raise taxes, it lowers tax receipts.
[01:57:11.524 --> 01:57:13.345]  They want us bankrupt!
[01:57:13.345 --> 01:57:16.828]  I'm gonna shut up and go back to... He just dropped off.
[01:57:16.828 --> 01:57:19.530]  I wanted to hear what the officer said in the meeting.
[01:57:19.530 --> 01:57:20.491]  Man, these guys.
[01:57:20.491 --> 01:57:21.392]  I say, stay there.
[01:57:21.392 --> 01:57:22.072]  I'm gonna go to you.
[01:57:22.072 --> 01:57:22.953]  And they hang up.
[01:57:22.953 --> 01:57:24.194]  Let's go to a police officer.
[01:57:24.194 --> 01:57:26.255]  Let's take an Illinois.
[01:57:26.255 --> 01:57:27.777]  Dale, what's your take on all this?
[01:57:29.073 --> 01:57:30.173]  How you doing Alex?
[01:57:30.173 --> 01:57:31.914]  I'm not doing good, I'll be quite frank with you.
[01:57:31.914 --> 01:57:33.455]  Yeah, I can tell my friend.
[01:57:33.455 --> 01:57:39.417]  Well, thanks for getting my blood pressure up too, I appreciate it.
[01:57:39.417 --> 01:57:41.878]  Long story short, I'll get real quick.
[01:57:41.878 --> 01:57:45.559]  I happen to be at the guard ground and we've trained out there a lot.
[01:57:45.559 --> 01:57:47.680]  I happened to walk by the ammo dump and
[01:57:49.682 --> 01:57:52.545]  Usually they have ammunition signed up, you know, for the engineer.
[01:57:52.545 --> 01:57:54.546]  I don't remember what the numbers are.
[01:57:54.546 --> 01:58:03.054]  Let's say the 1-2-3 brigade or engineer and the 1-2-3 road construction division or whatever.
[01:58:03.054 --> 01:58:06.977]  You know, they've got it allotted that way.
[01:58:06.977 --> 01:58:09.279]  They had contingency ammo.
[01:58:09.279 --> 01:58:11.981]  Almost 3 million rounds of 2-2-3.
[01:58:13.880 --> 01:58:20.644]  Or 5.56 and 7.62 by 51 or 308 as most people know it commercially.
[01:58:20.644 --> 01:58:21.565]  Contingency rounds?
[01:58:21.565 --> 01:58:22.425]  I've never seen that.
[01:58:22.425 --> 01:58:27.388]  And I've been out there a billion times in my 25 years on the force.
[01:58:27.388 --> 01:58:29.469]  Listen, I gotta go to break 60 seconds.
[01:58:29.469 --> 01:58:32.831]  I give you my word, I'll come right back to you because this is breaking news.
[01:58:32.831 --> 01:58:37.474]  This ties into the 1.6 billion bullets bought in the last 12 months.
[01:58:37.474 --> 01:58:39.755]  They are gearing up for absolute civil war.
[01:58:39.755 --> 01:58:40.536]  Stay there, don't hang up.
[01:58:42.267 --> 01:58:45.790]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:59:22.678 --> 01:59:25.860]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[01:59:25.860 --> 01:59:29.243]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[01:59:29.243 --> 01:59:33.387]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:59:33.387 --> 01:59:36.129]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:59:36.129 --> 01:59:37.690]  It's what my family uses.

[01:59:48.839 --> 01:59:50.560]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:06.499 --> 02:00:14.162]  You know, there's an old saying about, you know, I've been there, done that, I got the t-shirt to prove it.
[02:00:29.327 --> 02:00:44.179]  I've got countless videos, just one we shot last year in Illinois of the state police training with foreign troops putting people in the sports stadium in Chicago.
[02:00:44.179 --> 02:00:47.882]  I've been to countless urban warfare drills where they practice fighting the US militia.
[02:00:48.723 --> 02:00:58.494]  I mean, I remember learning about this 15 years ago, when emergency managers and police chiefs, like the police chief of San Antonio, because he'd been in Army Intelligence, Allie Philippus spoke out.
[02:00:58.494 --> 02:01:03.759]  I went and talked to him, the interview was public, and he said, yeah, they came in with piles of cash, dealt the force, tried to buy me off.
[02:01:04.380 --> 02:01:08.183]  I mean, there's been a covert shadow government takeover, and now it's coming to a head.
[02:01:08.183 --> 02:01:12.627]  It's a lot bigger than Obama, and I'm going to shut up and go to Dale, who's an Illinois police officer.
[02:01:12.627 --> 02:01:14.468]  You've got the floor for the rest of this segment.
[02:01:14.468 --> 02:01:15.850]  It's only four minutes.
[02:01:15.850 --> 02:01:21.574]  Break down again exactly what you saw, what you witnessed, where it was, what you can say.
[02:01:21.574 --> 02:01:30.542]  The three million rounds of extra ammo when you were training there at the guard base that ties into the 1.6 billion rounds of ammo and armored vehicles being cached around the country.
[02:01:30.542 --> 02:01:31.623]  And tell us what you think's happening.
[02:01:33.171 --> 02:01:35.813]  Well, I'll answer the last one first, but I think it's happening.
[02:01:35.813 --> 02:01:37.394]  They're getting ready for something big.
[02:01:37.394 --> 02:01:40.036]  I have no clue what it is.
[02:01:40.036 --> 02:01:43.238]  I have been keeping an eye on everything.
[02:01:43.238 --> 02:01:50.903]  All these executions, as I call them, of these innocent people from Columbine all the way to Connecticut.
[02:01:50.903 --> 02:01:55.366]  And anyway, long story short, is that this is all set up.
[02:01:55.366 --> 02:02:00.409]  There's too many... This story, when it first starts out, is totally different than what it is when it ends up.
[02:02:01.061 --> 02:02:04.862]  For instance, I'll go to Connecticut because it was basically the last one.
[02:02:04.862 --> 02:02:08.843]  That kid's AR-15 was in somebody else's car that was parked there.
[02:02:08.843 --> 02:02:11.163]  Two other people take off running and they catch him.
[02:02:11.163 --> 02:02:12.684]  Now, this whole thing is staged.
[02:02:12.684 --> 02:02:23.066]  As far as the ammunition is concerned, there was... It's always been... When you walk by it, you know, we don't get into it because, you know, we're a police department, we're not military.
[02:02:23.066 --> 02:02:25.507]  But anyway, you walk by it and you see...
[02:02:26.445 --> 02:02:26.665]  I think?
[02:02:57.628 --> 02:03:02.509]  Computer, uh, uh, it's, uh, properbroadcasting.com.
[02:03:02.509 --> 02:03:14.032]  I started doing a program with them, uh, talking to people about, telling people what firearms actually are, as far as the, uh, you know, the assault weapons, which we, none of us have assault weapons.
[02:03:14.032 --> 02:03:23.894]  We've got semi-automatics, you know, and, and, personally honest with you, me being on the TAC team, I've got, not only do I have a semi-automatic, but I've also got a sniper rifle.
[02:03:23.894 --> 02:03:25.655]  Um, you know, they're gonna say my 700,
[02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:43.769]  Now it's going to become classified as a... No, that's right, I've got multiple Remington 700s, actually used police guns I bought, and they're great guns, and they're great deer hunting rifles, but the point is, is they're saying those are now military, you've got to turn them in.
[02:03:43.769 --> 02:03:56.056]  The optics, everything, look, you say they're gearing up for something, you don't know what it is, previously there probably might be a few thousand rounds of ammo at a National Guard drill, if even ammo at all, now a cache of three million rounds,
[02:03:57.990 --> 02:03:59.371]  This is the answer.
[02:03:59.371 --> 02:04:15.321]  They're going to try a gun confiscation, and it's going to cause a civil war, and that's the plan, because they're then going to call the citizens that don't turn their guns in, terrorists, just like the Redcoats did in 1776.
[02:04:15.321 --> 02:04:18.443]  That's how the country started.
[02:04:18.443 --> 02:04:20.264]  That's how Texas started.
[02:04:20.264 --> 02:04:24.327]  And the police you talk to, are they waking up, or are they just going along with this?
[02:04:25.256 --> 02:04:26.477]  We're good.
[02:04:26.477 --> 02:04:30.922]  It seems like two years ago I was a conspiracy theorist.
[02:04:30.922 --> 02:04:33.485]  Now we're going, you know, you've got a point.
[02:04:33.485 --> 02:04:42.795]  The problem that I have right now is that I'm in a rank that I can kind of sneak into some of the meetings and get some intel as much as I possibly can.
[02:04:42.795 --> 02:04:44.717]  But I do know when it hits the fan.
[02:04:45.337 --> 02:04:46.438]  Hold on, hold on.
[02:04:46.438 --> 02:04:47.859]  I want to hear more from you.
[02:05:02.012 --> 02:05:06.115]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu, and other illnesses.
[02:05:06.115 --> 02:05:07.336]  Don't be one of them!

[02:07:03.070 --> 02:07:08.654]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[02:07:08.654 --> 02:07:11.897]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[02:07:11.897 --> 02:07:14.719]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[02:07:14.719 --> 02:07:17.721]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[02:07:17.721 --> 02:07:20.744]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[02:07:21.224 --> 02:07:26.430]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[02:07:26.430 --> 02:07:29.112]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.

[02:08:02.970 --> 02:08:07.811]  There's an old saying in Tennessee, I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee, that says, fool me once,
[02:08:09.824 --> 02:08:12.606]  Shame on me.
[02:08:12.606 --> 02:08:13.406]  Shame on you.
[02:08:13.406 --> 02:08:16.648]  If you fool me, we can't get fooled again.
[02:08:16.648 --> 02:08:22.270]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:08:22.270 --> 02:08:28.934]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:28.934 --> 02:08:34.497]  Well, if you ever wanted to see the fall of America and how it would be taken over from within,
[02:08:38.084 --> 02:08:39.645]  You are seeing it.
[02:08:39.645 --> 02:08:42.365]  The collectivists believe this is their chance to take over.
[02:08:42.365 --> 02:08:50.788]  They have always been spoiling for a Civil War homeland security fight with American gun owners and conservatives.
[02:08:50.788 --> 02:08:53.329]  And I hope you realize this is not radio theater.
[02:08:54.378 --> 02:08:55.338]  I have FBI.
[02:08:55.338 --> 02:08:57.679]  I have federal marshal.
[02:08:57.679 --> 02:08:59.019]  I have state police sources.
[02:08:59.019 --> 02:09:02.080]  You know we've broken many a national news story.
[02:09:02.080 --> 02:09:06.501]  The Army War College is training against its main enemy, the Tea Party.
[02:09:06.501 --> 02:09:07.922]  That's Forbes.
[02:09:07.922 --> 02:09:09.702]  That's AP.
[02:09:09.702 --> 02:09:11.063]  I covered it in the last two hours.
[02:09:11.063 --> 02:09:16.184]  We got loaded police and military on the phone lines here.
[02:09:16.184 --> 02:09:19.105]  And for me, I mean, I'm right at the tip of the spear.
[02:09:20.546 --> 02:09:25.250]  You better believe I'm deader than a hammer if all this goes down.
[02:09:25.250 --> 02:09:30.916]  And I'm far beyond offensive, you know, type stuff.
[02:09:30.916 --> 02:09:34.839]  In fact, I don't even want to get into defensively things.
[02:09:34.839 --> 02:09:39.704]  I mean, I think for anybody who knows how the world really works, you need to understand something.
[02:09:39.704 --> 02:09:43.107]  My only hope is if the globalists do try to hunt down the American people,
[02:09:44.850 --> 02:09:47.291]  It's not kissing the police's butts.
[02:09:47.291 --> 02:09:51.032]  It's like Christ said, forgive them, Father, they know not what they do.
[02:09:51.032 --> 02:09:55.293]  The globalists plan on the patriots and the police killing each other.
[02:09:55.293 --> 02:10:11.218]  And if you talk to our other sources we've had on air and confirmed, you notice in this whole shutdown of society scenario, they have the police guard the local government district.
[02:10:12.285 --> 02:10:17.070]  Government bureaucrats and corporate heads live in certain enclaves.
[02:10:17.070 --> 02:10:22.675]  Even though in every major city there'll be lots of rich areas, notice they always live in just a few block area.
[02:10:22.675 --> 02:10:25.478]  That's because they're a mafia.
[02:10:25.478 --> 02:10:27.299]  And the police are supposed to guard them.
[02:10:27.299 --> 02:10:36.068]  The police are supposed to march out and arrest us and set up checkpoints with the army and have firefights with us and mobile armored pillboxes and
[02:10:39.628 --> 02:10:45.169]  While the globalists sit back in their little armed redoubts with police guarding them.
[02:10:45.169 --> 02:10:48.070]  Now, I don't have fantasies about a hot war.
[02:10:48.070 --> 02:10:53.411]  I don't have fantasies about, oh, I'm going to be this revolutionary and this is going to be great.
[02:10:53.411 --> 02:10:57.592]  Everything I've done has been trying to stop this.
[02:10:57.592 --> 02:10:58.732]  Everything I've done.
[02:10:58.732 --> 02:11:03.113]  And I hate watching people get played as fools.
[02:11:05.106 --> 02:11:10.529]  And the fact that they're going to try to cause a civil war where the police and military get killed along with U.S.
[02:11:10.529 --> 02:11:21.096]  citizens while we kill each other, so a bunch of globalists can engage in social engineering and literally laugh at us, just like they have Shiites and Sunnis kill each other in the Middle East.
[02:11:21.096 --> 02:11:23.857]  And it's official Pentagon doctrine.
[02:11:23.857 --> 02:11:28.800]  To stir up, to destabilize those countries, to make sure radicals get in charge.
[02:11:28.800 --> 02:11:29.461]  Man, that's evil.
[02:11:33.573 --> 02:11:34.954]  So in the end, remember who did this.
[02:11:34.954 --> 02:11:44.498]  It was JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, the big banks that have all been caught laundering drug money, the ones that run the Federal Reserve, the ones that run the Ponzi scheme.
[02:11:44.498 --> 02:11:49.059]  They want America under their control so that we sign on to all their debt.
[02:11:49.059 --> 02:11:51.700]  Which are too big to fail because they're bringing us down with them.
[02:11:51.700 --> 02:11:52.621]  Which was part of the plan.
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:57.341]  Now we do have Doug Hagman, he's been having his email blocked and a bunch of stuff going on.
[02:11:57.341 --> 02:12:01.642]  His source, which is in DHS, is confirmed by my sources.
[02:12:01.642 --> 02:12:09.603]  Now again, back during the election I said, they're going to steal this probably for Obama, and I made jokes about Romney may win, but it was all staged, it didn't matter.
[02:12:09.603 --> 02:12:13.784]  I'm going to go back to your calls right now, Dale in Illinois here in a moment.
[02:12:13.784 --> 02:12:19.726]  And then Ron and Brian and Mac and Carl, we're going to get to all of you, ahead of Hagman.
[02:12:19.726 --> 02:12:21.506]  But I want you to just understand something.
[02:12:22.503 --> 02:12:30.907]  That I told you, they're constantly saying they're gonna drop this hammer, drop that hammer, to see who will go along with it and to get you ready for it.
[02:12:30.907 --> 02:12:34.388]  But now, I'm telling you, all the signs are there.
[02:12:34.388 --> 02:12:45.673]  And if you just joined us, this police officer in Illinois, a senior officer, who's in on these meetings, where they're pushing this whole takeover, he was saying, yeah, now they go out to National Guard, small base, to do training.
[02:12:49.051 --> 02:12:51.094]  And usually there's not even ammo there.
[02:12:51.094 --> 02:12:53.256]  Now there's 3 million ammos at 223 and 308.
[02:12:53.256 --> 02:12:55.779]  Yeah, it's 1.6 billion rounds.
[02:12:55.779 --> 02:12:59.764]  They admit for civil unrest, folks, 1.6 billion rounds.
[02:12:59.764 --> 02:13:03.609]  That's enough to kill every American four times.
[02:13:03.609 --> 02:13:06.452]  This is a takeover.
[02:13:06.452 --> 02:13:08.074]  Let me read to you from the Congressional Report.
[02:13:09.045 --> 02:13:15.587]  January 10th, 1963, Congressional Record Appendix PPA34-A35.
[02:13:15.587 --> 02:13:17.528]  Current Communist Goals.
[02:13:17.528 --> 02:13:20.069]  Extension of Remarks by Honorable A.S.
[02:13:20.069 --> 02:13:21.009]  Herlong, Jr.
[02:13:21.009 --> 02:13:23.650]  of Florida and the House of Representatives.
[02:13:23.650 --> 02:13:25.111]  Thursday, January 10th, 1963.
[02:13:25.111 --> 02:13:31.473]  This is from the Naked Communist by Cleon Skousen from Intelligence Leaked.
[02:13:32.421 --> 02:13:38.402]  Develop the illusion that total disarmament by the United States would be a demonstration of moral strength.
[02:13:38.402 --> 02:13:45.124]  That same year, they put out Memorandum 7277 calling for all Americans to be disarmed under a U.N.
[02:13:45.124 --> 02:13:45.724]  treaty.
[02:13:45.724 --> 02:13:46.444]  That U.N.
[02:13:46.444 --> 02:13:51.305]  treaty, that same treaty, they've never gotten passed, brought back every year, is set to pass in March.
[02:13:51.305 --> 02:13:54.685]  This is the move.
[02:13:54.685 --> 02:13:55.786]  Okay, I'm gonna shut up.
[02:13:55.786 --> 02:13:56.926]  Just, it's, it's, it's, look.
[02:13:57.938 --> 02:14:01.643]  I'm literally like somebody here on a sinking ship doing this broadcast, okay?
[02:14:01.643 --> 02:14:03.445]  People say, well, you know, what do we do?
[02:14:03.445 --> 02:14:04.987]  We can't beat them, let them take over.
[02:14:04.987 --> 02:14:07.670]  Folks, they plan horrible things for America.
[02:14:11.254 --> 02:14:13.055]  And a lot of you are like, well, I'll serve them then.
[02:14:13.055 --> 02:14:14.535]  There is no serving them.
[02:14:14.535 --> 02:14:17.376]  They shoot you up with cancer virus filled shots.
[02:14:17.376 --> 02:14:25.238]  Dale in Illinois, you were talking about the three million bullets you saw and all the rest of it and some of the other officers starting to wake up.
[02:14:25.238 --> 02:14:30.900]  Finish your point about, you know, wanting to stay in there because you're senior enough to be in these meetings.
[02:14:30.900 --> 02:14:33.181]  Give us any info about what goes on with DHS.
[02:14:33.181 --> 02:14:37.882]  I mean, I know from some of the mainstream articles, they're hardening all the facilities for martial law.
[02:14:37.882 --> 02:14:38.723]  Millions dead.
[02:14:38.723 --> 02:14:39.483]  That's all come out.
[02:14:41.307 --> 02:14:47.264]  And just finish, any other points you'd like to make about, you were saying you've got your phone tree ready, you know, if certain orders go out.
[02:14:49.100 --> 02:14:51.062]  Yeah, we'll start with that one first.
[02:14:51.062 --> 02:14:59.589]  Yeah, we've got a phone tree that we're going to go out and then from that point on we've got some contingency communications that we've got set up.
[02:14:59.589 --> 02:15:03.333]  The only way they're going to be able to stop is to whack us with an EMP pulse.
[02:15:03.333 --> 02:15:05.054]  Two things I want to hit real quick.
[02:15:05.054 --> 02:15:09.198]  Number one, you're not the only one that feels like you're on that sinking ship.
[02:15:09.198 --> 02:15:10.098]  And believe it or not,
[02:15:11.383 --> 02:15:18.316]  When it hits a fan, I'm probably going to be one of the first ones they try to take out because I'm probably one of the most boisterous.
[02:15:18.316 --> 02:15:20.260]  But then again if they try that...
[02:15:21.545 --> 02:15:28.647]  They'll just make a martyr out of me because I've got a large family and the only thing you're going to do is piss off about 10 or 12 of my young nephews.
[02:15:28.647 --> 02:15:30.127]  And remember, they'll run a sigh off.
[02:15:30.127 --> 02:15:32.128]  They'll blow up a school and say you did it.
[02:15:32.128 --> 02:15:35.489]  Or they'll... Well yeah, that's already... I've discussed that with people.
[02:15:35.489 --> 02:15:42.151]  That if anything nasty would happen, like for instance, they would say that I killed my wife and committed suicide.
[02:15:42.151 --> 02:15:44.371]  I've already got that taken care of.
[02:15:44.371 --> 02:15:46.752]  People know that that's not the truth and that'll never happen.
[02:15:47.759 --> 02:15:56.463]  So basically, I've learned a lot from you, believe it or not.
[02:15:56.463 --> 02:16:00.125]  I've been feeling some of your thunder when I've talked to people.
[02:16:00.125 --> 02:16:04.928]  I hope you don't mind.
[02:16:04.928 --> 02:16:09.490]  There are a lot more people waking up today than there were, I would say, six months ago.
[02:16:11.146 --> 02:16:19.510]  My biggest fear is that I'm going to have a gas leak in this house and the place is going to blow up and it'll probably end up being as a hellfire missile hitting the place.
[02:16:19.510 --> 02:16:22.231]  Well, exactly, but listen, here's the issue.
[02:16:22.231 --> 02:16:24.932]  Listen, we've got patriots everywhere and God bless you, sir.
[02:16:24.932 --> 02:16:26.053]  I appreciate you calling us.
[02:16:26.053 --> 02:16:28.073]  Listen, we're going to move to other callers quickly now.
[02:16:28.073 --> 02:16:28.974]  I've been hogging the time.
[02:16:31.030 --> 02:16:35.673]  Listen, the globalists are very small, but they command the heights and can put out official stories.
[02:16:35.673 --> 02:16:37.995]  We discredit them, we expose them.
[02:16:37.995 --> 02:16:41.757]  They're moving ahead with this because they're in trouble.
[02:16:41.757 --> 02:16:44.899]  Their own internal documents that are public say this.
[02:16:44.899 --> 02:16:47.101]  I've talked about Brzezinski's book this year.
[02:16:47.101 --> 02:16:49.482]  He's one of the top globalist planners.
[02:16:49.482 --> 02:16:52.704]  They're trying to finish things because they're behind.
[02:16:52.704 --> 02:16:53.965]  Okay?
[02:16:53.965 --> 02:16:56.667]  Most people in government aren't terrorists or killers.
[02:16:56.667 --> 02:16:59.709]  They've got to put out cover stories and get us to buy into it.
[02:17:01.730 --> 02:17:05.074]  Most people in government are upset about what's happening.
[02:17:05.074 --> 02:17:07.818]  That's why they have to put out this narrative and demonize gun owners.
[02:17:07.818 --> 02:17:09.139]  Let's go to another call here.
[02:17:09.139 --> 02:17:16.128]  Let's talk to Ron in New York, and then I promise I'm going to Carl, who's a Marine, Bryant, who's a Marine, and Mac, who's a Marine.
[02:17:16.128 --> 02:17:17.470]  Real quick, Ron, make your point.
[02:17:18.339 --> 02:17:18.919]  Yes, Alex.
[02:17:18.919 --> 02:17:31.646]  There will now be a public service announcement type commercial with numerous members of Hollywood, actors and actresses from Hollywood, telling people that they should ban guns and that we should outlaw guns.
[02:17:31.646 --> 02:17:36.889]  I find this unusual considering that most people in Hollywood live in areas that you couldn't even walk through.
[02:17:36.889 --> 02:17:39.150]  Sir, we've played the ad put out by Bloomberg.
[02:17:39.150 --> 02:17:45.053]  We've played it with 50 people, including Jamie Foxx that says kill all the white people.
[02:17:45.053 --> 02:17:45.934]  He says turn our guns in.
[02:17:46.819 --> 02:17:54.103]  Let me go further, and they all hide behind battalions of heavily armed security for themselves.
[02:17:54.103 --> 02:17:58.466]  And I also found it interesting that some of them in there, one was Gwyneth Paltrow.
[02:17:58.466 --> 02:18:02.868]  Gwyneth Paltrow is not even an American national, she's a British citizen.
[02:18:02.868 --> 02:18:09.152]  And I find it unusual because I have noticed as of late this slight pattern of seeing British nationals
[02:18:10.009 --> 02:18:11.690]  You know, that's why we put out, that's why we put out the
[02:18:32.538 --> 02:18:37.602]  Petition that's almost 100,000 right now, saying deport Piers Morgan.
[02:18:37.602 --> 02:18:39.184]  And they're like, what about our First Amendment?
[02:18:39.184 --> 02:18:40.365]  What about our second?
[02:18:40.365 --> 02:18:46.370]  You're a foreigner engaged in subversion, and I cited the Supreme Court ruling.
[02:18:46.370 --> 02:18:47.691]  Get out of my country.
[02:18:47.691 --> 02:18:49.493]  Look, look, listen.
[02:18:49.493 --> 02:18:54.197]  It's illegal for citizens to call for, say, making black people slaves again.
[02:18:54.197 --> 02:18:55.118]  It's called subversion.
[02:18:55.698 --> 02:18:56.600]  Okay?
[02:18:56.600 --> 02:19:04.855]  And I'm tired of it, and Piers Morgan is a piece of trash who bragged on his own Twitter that he's here to conquer America.
[02:19:04.855 --> 02:19:08.162]  What do you think about all these pro-gun Facebooks getting shut down right now?
[02:19:08.991 --> 02:19:10.732]  Well, of course, that's what's going to happen.
[02:19:10.732 --> 02:19:24.017]  We knew that was going to come sooner or later, and it's going to get worse, because they know that the Internet is where patriots can put their message out, and that's where they're going to start to crack down more and more and more, using every unscrupulous and underhanded trick to do it.
[02:19:24.017 --> 02:19:26.338]  So, we knew that was coming.
[02:19:26.338 --> 02:19:32.761]  But it really does get me to see somebody who is, like I said, not only from another country, but a country who fought two wars against.
[02:19:32.761 --> 02:19:33.881]  And it's not just Piers Morgan.
[02:19:33.881 --> 02:19:35.122]  There are a few others I noticed.
[02:19:35.122 --> 02:19:37.363]  This has become apparent more clearly as of late.
[02:19:38.181 --> 02:19:41.104]  Uh, telling us, you know, how we should conduct our internal affairs.
[02:19:41.104 --> 02:19:41.465]  No, no.
[02:19:41.465 --> 02:19:45.769]  The globalists bring in foreign propaganda mercenaries to flaunt.
[02:19:45.769 --> 02:19:48.672]  No other country would put up with foreigners telling them what to do.
[02:19:48.672 --> 02:19:51.996]  It's all about breaking our will, flaunting it in our face.
[02:19:51.996 --> 02:19:57.842]  Like that illegal alien that got a free kidney, uh, donated to him by Loyola up in Illinois.
[02:19:57.842 --> 02:19:59.023]  He said, that's not enough.
[02:19:59.023 --> 02:19:59.964]  I want more.
[02:20:01.125 --> 02:20:02.546]  My name is Josh.
[02:20:02.546 --> 02:20:05.068]  One World Whey is the best in the market, hands down.
[02:20:05.068 --> 02:20:05.668]  I'm in the U.S.
[02:20:05.668 --> 02:20:07.849]  Navy, and I live a very active lifestyle.
[02:20:07.849 --> 02:20:10.631]  Being a vegetarian, it's hard getting all the protein I need.
[02:20:10.631 --> 02:20:14.373]  I tried their vegan protein powders, and I just wasn't feeling any change.
[02:20:14.373 --> 02:20:20.637]  The Meathead Supplement Store Whey Protein kind of worked for a bit, but it left me feeling bloated, and my digestion seemed to slow down.
[02:20:20.637 --> 02:20:25.440]  By some divine stroke of luck, I heard a commercial of One World Whey on the radio, and it struck my interest.
[02:20:25.660 --> 02:20:27.981]  I have to tell you, I am so glad I got it.
[02:20:27.981 --> 02:20:31.182]  I have been taking it for a week and the results are amazing.
[02:20:31.182 --> 02:20:34.083]  I don't feel tired when I have to get up at 4.30 a.m.
[02:20:34.083 --> 02:20:35.744]  I look and feel better.
[02:20:35.744 --> 02:20:38.485]  I recover faster from my two workouts a day.
[02:20:38.485 --> 02:20:44.347]  When I don't have time to eat good food, I take it and I don't feel the urge to stuff my face for hours.
[02:20:44.347 --> 02:20:47.608]  I got up this morning and I looked the leanest I've looked since high school.
[02:20:47.608 --> 02:20:48.829]  I can go on and on.
[02:20:48.829 --> 02:20:51.490]  The best I can do to repay you is buy more and tell my friends.
[02:20:51.630 --> 02:20:52.130]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:20:52.130 --> 02:20:52.330]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:20:52.330 --> 02:20:53.191]  Or visit OneWorldWHEY.com.
[02:21:02.076 --> 02:21:04.317]  Hey there, Frank Bates here.
[02:21:04.317 --> 02:21:09.378]  Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans?
[02:21:09.378 --> 02:21:11.179]  This is really scary stuff.
[02:21:11.179 --> 02:21:16.461]  Defense experts warn that this odd device poses the gravest threat we've ever known.
[02:21:16.461 --> 02:21:23.643]  In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat.
[02:21:24.503 --> 02:21:27.284]  I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.
[02:21:27.284 --> 02:21:31.065]  It may be because the liberals in the government are trying to cover it up.
[02:21:31.065 --> 02:21:39.607]  That's why my friend just created a free video at WeirdDevice.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors off the conspiracy.
[02:21:39.607 --> 02:21:49.750]  Go watch the shocking video at WeirdDevice.com right now to discover exactly what it is, plus discover the number one way you and your family can survive this deadly attack.
[02:21:50.510 --> 02:21:55.845]  I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to WeirdDevice.com before it's gone forever.
[02:21:55.845 --> 02:21:57.870]  Again, that's WeirdDevice.com.
[02:22:00.011 --> 02:22:01.572]  Don't throw away leftovers.
[02:22:01.572 --> 02:22:07.658]  Instead, throw all your leftovers, vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts, and more into the Bokashi!
[02:22:07.658 --> 02:22:15.866]  If you love to garden and compost, but don't like the hassle of turning a compost bin or the smell, then check out the E-M Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System from Terragonics.
[02:22:15.866 --> 02:22:21.531]  Finally, a way to recycle all your food and plant waste safely and effectively and stop using fertilizers.
[02:22:21.531 --> 02:22:23.733]  The E-M Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System.
[02:22:24.033 --> 02:22:34.080]  Rather than decomposition, the Bokashi system uses fermentation to break down waste, so it takes less time to create nutrient-dense humus for crops or gardens, with no turning and no obnoxious odors.
[02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:39.144]  To learn more and order your Bokashi online, visit Terragonics.com and click on the orange button.

[02:22:44.347 --> 02:22:44.808]  Or call 866-369-3678.
[02:22:44.808 --> 02:22:45.048]  That's 866-369-3678.
[02:22:51.232 --> 02:22:56.894]  Recycle all your food wastes in about six weeks with the Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System from Terragonics.com.
[02:22:56.894 --> 02:22:57.874]  Terragonics.
[02:22:57.874 --> 02:23:01.115]  Life's getting better.
[02:23:01.115 --> 02:23:12.679]  You land in Buenos Aires, then a shuttle to Santa Rosa, where a nicely furnished cabin with all amenities, Wi-Fi, executive food and wine, and laundry service awaits.
[02:23:12.679 --> 02:23:16.101]  After a good night's sleep, your adventure begins.
[02:23:16.101 --> 02:23:19.562]  You're on a golden stag safari for big game.
[02:23:20.522 --> 02:23:21.823]  But it's not Africa.
[02:23:21.823 --> 02:23:23.384]  It's Argentina.
[02:23:23.384 --> 02:23:32.191]  One-on-one guided hunts for water buffalo, cougar, bighorn rams, wild boar, and the biggest stag deer in South America.
[02:23:32.191 --> 02:23:34.073]  All gold medal quality.
[02:23:34.073 --> 02:23:35.634]  All the action you can handle.
[02:23:37.153 --> 02:23:45.280]  Land rovers, top rental guns with scopes, all food, beverages, hunting guides, ground transportation included and more.
[02:23:45.280 --> 02:23:48.223]  All more affordable than you can imagine.
[02:23:48.223 --> 02:23:53.368]  The adventure of a lifetime starts at GoldenStagSafaris.com.
[02:23:53.368 --> 02:23:55.450]  The big game hunting ranch.
[02:23:55.450 --> 02:23:57.251]  GoldenStagSafaris.com.
[02:24:05.722 --> 02:24:11.884]  Everybody knows we've got criminals hijacking the country.
[02:24:11.884 --> 02:24:16.105]  And the crooks don't care.
[02:24:16.105 --> 02:24:18.345]  They're arrogant.
[02:24:18.345 --> 02:24:23.007]  A lot of these globalists, though, they've never actually been in a fight themselves.
[02:24:23.007 --> 02:24:30.689]  And we've got to rattle them and let them know that we see them, we know who they are, and that we're not going to let them get away with what they've done.
[02:24:32.278 --> 02:24:38.204]  But everybody out there that's always talked big about it, they come for my guns, you know, they're going to get them bullets first and all this.
[02:24:38.204 --> 02:24:43.550]  You better engage in information warfare right now.
[02:24:43.550 --> 02:24:45.932]  Right now.
[02:24:45.932 --> 02:24:49.215]  Because the authoritarians want to hunt you down.
[02:24:49.215 --> 02:24:52.519]  They're going to say you're a terrorist, they're going to put you in a re-education camp.
[02:24:52.519 --> 02:24:54.401]  That's in the official Army field manuals.
[02:24:55.256 --> 02:24:57.577]  And a lot of people will get scared when all this goes down.
[02:24:57.577 --> 02:24:59.097]  They're going to turn in their guns.
[02:24:59.097 --> 02:25:00.998]  They're going to rat out their neighbor.
[02:25:00.998 --> 02:25:02.118]  I like Obama now.
[02:25:02.118 --> 02:25:03.119]  I used to be, didn't like him.
[02:25:03.119 --> 02:25:04.739]  But my neighbor, he's with Al Qaeda.
[02:25:04.739 --> 02:25:05.600]  Get him!
[02:25:05.600 --> 02:25:06.680]  That's how they're going to work.
[02:25:06.680 --> 02:25:08.081]  These people think you're scum.
[02:25:08.081 --> 02:25:12.582]  They think they've beaten you.
[02:25:12.582 --> 02:25:14.423]  And they think it's funny what they've done.
[02:25:14.423 --> 02:25:15.363]  These are operatives.
[02:25:15.363 --> 02:25:16.724]  They know what they're doing.
[02:25:16.724 --> 02:25:17.564]  These are not liberals.
[02:25:18.191 --> 02:25:21.194]  And they've got the Republicans lined up saying they're going to go along with it.
[02:25:21.194 --> 02:25:24.317]  Let's go to Carl in North Carolina who's a Marine.
[02:25:24.317 --> 02:25:26.279]  Then we're going to go to Bryant and others.
[02:25:26.279 --> 02:25:27.540]  Go ahead Carl, you're on the air.
[02:25:27.540 --> 02:25:29.402]  Hi, how you doing?
[02:25:31.325 --> 02:25:34.326]  First thing, you just brought up Piers Morgan.
[02:25:34.326 --> 02:25:37.847]  He's lucky it's not 200 years ago where he can get tired of feathers.
[02:25:37.847 --> 02:25:43.028]  And another thing, all these homegrown redcoats, I'm about tired of them.
[02:25:43.028 --> 02:25:48.249]  They need to understand the Constitution and understand that's the foundation of this country.
[02:25:48.249 --> 02:25:53.991]  Now, the Marine Corps is an excellent organization and my commanding officers like
[02:25:54.631 --> 02:26:02.477]  For the past six years, everyone I've had has pounded that during the Constitution is what we go by.
[02:26:02.477 --> 02:26:05.599]  We need strict adherence to it.
[02:26:05.599 --> 02:26:09.663]  And that has always made me feel really good.
[02:26:09.663 --> 02:26:13.706]  So I'm a strict constitutionalist myself.
[02:26:13.706 --> 02:26:19.390]  And everything's just kind of overwhelming right now.
[02:26:19.390 --> 02:26:20.171]  And especially with
[02:26:20.925 --> 02:26:23.646]  All the talk of coming to get our guns.
[02:26:23.646 --> 02:26:25.426]  Because I do not agree with that at all.
[02:26:51.607 --> 02:26:54.408]  The shootings is being shut down.
[02:26:54.408 --> 02:26:58.429]  Anyone who puts even mild... Man, let me tell you, folks, this is what I'm saying.
[02:26:58.429 --> 02:27:01.370]  They're dropping the hammer right now.
[02:27:01.370 --> 02:27:04.671]  I mean, they've shut down our Facebook.
[02:27:04.671 --> 02:27:06.291]  They've shut down Mike Adams.
[02:27:06.291 --> 02:27:10.712]  This is a test of their cyber takeover.
[02:27:10.712 --> 02:27:16.074]  The Marines you talk to, are they understanding what's happening and how much trouble we're in?
[02:27:18.228 --> 02:27:24.550]  I'd say about 40% are hardline constitutionalists, those around me.
[02:27:24.550 --> 02:27:31.233]  You could say another 40% just, they don't care, they'd rather watch football and talk about football all day.
[02:27:31.233 --> 02:27:34.974]  And then the other 20, I mean, you could get them to go either way.
[02:27:34.974 --> 02:27:36.455]  It's just whatever is being mentioned.
[02:27:37.455 --> 02:27:40.958]  Well, people better get out today and do pro-gun manor hangs.
[02:27:40.958 --> 02:27:43.000]  Everybody better call other talk shows today.
[02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:52.107]  Everybody better call Congress and their state houses, because I've never seen them shutting down the pro-gun Facebooks across the board.
[02:27:52.107 --> 02:27:55.990]  In fact, we've now confirmed they've shut down three of our Facebooks.
[02:27:55.990 --> 02:28:00.153]  I've never seen stuff like this happen.
[02:28:00.153 --> 02:28:03.616]  And again, they're shutting down gun shows.
[02:28:07.088 --> 02:28:09.070]  They are shutting down stuff across the board.
[02:28:09.070 --> 02:28:09.551]  God bless you.
[02:28:09.551 --> 02:28:11.172]  I appreciate what you have to say.
[02:28:11.172 --> 02:28:14.375]  People, you better use the First Amendment while we've still got it.
[02:28:14.375 --> 02:28:24.525]  I mean, and all the mainline conservatives, you better just admit we were right about the New World Order and get hardcore or it's all over.
[02:28:24.525 --> 02:28:26.948]  I mean, this is a criminal foreign takeover.
[02:28:26.948 --> 02:28:28.750]  I don't know how else I'm supposed to say it.
[02:28:30.100 --> 02:28:32.362]  And they can't let us operate when they do this.
[02:28:32.362 --> 02:28:34.203]  They're gonna start shutting things down.
[02:28:34.203 --> 02:28:37.966]  And they're testing and probing to see if they can shut us down.
[02:28:37.966 --> 02:28:41.909]  I mean, Facebook, what a mafia with their pump-and-dump scam.
[02:28:41.909 --> 02:28:43.331]  It's called mafia.
[02:28:43.331 --> 02:28:45.813]  Bryant, in Texas, a Marine.
[02:28:45.813 --> 02:28:46.493]  You're on the air.
[02:28:46.493 --> 02:28:48.134]  Yes, sir.
[02:28:48.134 --> 02:28:48.695]  Hey, Alex.
[02:28:48.695 --> 02:28:49.676]  How's it going?
[02:28:49.676 --> 02:28:50.396]  Got about a minute, sir.
[02:28:50.396 --> 02:28:50.737]  Go ahead.
[02:28:50.737 --> 02:28:51.097]  I'm fine.
[02:28:52.148 --> 02:28:53.349]  Hey brother, I just wanted to ask you.
[02:28:53.349 --> 02:28:55.751]  I mean, we see all this, you know, gun control.
[02:28:55.751 --> 02:28:56.992]  I mean, I already had three of my buddies.
[02:28:56.992 --> 02:28:57.912]  You're talking about Facebook.
[02:28:57.912 --> 02:28:59.593]  I had three of my buddies from Marines.
[02:28:59.593 --> 02:29:01.615]  Just had some guns on their Facebook.
[02:29:01.615 --> 02:29:03.957]  All three of those accounts have been, uh, shut down by Facebook.
[02:29:03.957 --> 02:29:05.878]  They're no longer able to access them.
[02:29:05.878 --> 02:29:08.920]  When do we as a country, when do we as just a nation come together?
[02:29:08.920 --> 02:29:11.242]  When is it when we start saying, okay,
[02:29:12.819 --> 02:29:14.440]  Okay, now we're going to defend ourselves.
[02:29:14.440 --> 02:29:15.861]  Sir, sir, have you read?
[02:29:15.861 --> 02:29:19.944]  They are scripting that veterans and gun owners are terrorists.
[02:29:19.944 --> 02:29:21.225]  They're saying we're racist.
[02:29:21.225 --> 02:29:23.007]  They're saying we deserve to die.
[02:29:23.007 --> 02:29:26.129]  They're saying Wayne LaPierre deserves to die.
[02:29:26.129 --> 02:29:28.411]  They're coming, that's what I'm saying, see?
[02:29:28.411 --> 02:29:32.534]  They just shut down, guys you know, because they're making pro-gun statements.
[02:29:32.534 --> 02:29:36.577]  We're not going to have a First Amendment, we're having nothing, because the word has gone out.
[02:29:36.577 --> 02:29:39.819]  They wouldn't be selling off the gun manufacturers, they wouldn't be
[02:29:41.129 --> 02:29:44.273]  Doing all of this and shutting down gun shows on TV.
[02:29:44.273 --> 02:29:51.502]  If the word hadn't gone out, Obama's gonna sign an executive order and now they're announcing he is!
[02:29:51.502 --> 02:29:52.903]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.903 --> 02:29:55.426]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.426 --> 02:29:58.090]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.949 --> 02:30:03.950]  This man wants your guns.

[02:32:15.382 --> 02:32:18.785]  And it's available discounted at Infowars.com.
[02:32:18.785 --> 02:32:22.249]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.

[02:33:33.388 --> 02:33:37.949]  We have more police officers holding.
[02:33:37.949 --> 02:33:43.590]  You just heard the Marine earlier about all his buddies getting their Facebook shut down because of pro-gun statements.
[02:33:43.590 --> 02:33:50.291]  Everyone I know is running in here saying we're getting calls by everybody, their Facebooks have been shut down.
[02:33:50.291 --> 02:33:54.392]  If you put one word about the Second Amendment on your Facebook, it's gone.
[02:33:54.392 --> 02:33:57.273]  So, Facebook declares no free speech for gun owners.
[02:33:58.033 --> 02:33:59.635]  Red alert!
[02:33:59.635 --> 02:34:01.977]  Man, this is a purge!
[02:34:01.977 --> 02:34:05.761]  They are saying you're a racist terrorist if you own guns!
[02:34:05.761 --> 02:34:08.024]  How bad does the demonization have to get?
[02:34:09.910 --> 02:34:18.516]  Now I've been telling you they're gearing up with the 1.6 billion bullets and all the urban warfare training manuals for martial law in this country.
[02:34:18.516 --> 02:34:21.398]  And I want to go over some more of these headlines here before we go to our guest.
[02:34:41.071 --> 02:34:47.033]  United States Senator Dianne Feinstein says all gun owners to be fingerprinted, most guns to be banned.
[02:34:47.033 --> 02:34:49.034]  Off the chart incredible.
[02:34:49.034 --> 02:34:51.115]  I mean, this is not even getting attention.
[02:34:51.115 --> 02:34:57.537]  Feinstein's also come out in public letters along with Como, saying they're going to ban guns and make you turn them in.
[02:34:57.537 --> 02:35:00.378]  This is just amazing.
[02:35:00.378 --> 02:35:01.859]  Own a gun, you're a racist.
[02:35:01.859 --> 02:35:03.960]  Curt Nemo article about Michael Moore.
[02:35:03.960 --> 02:35:08.662]  Feinstein and Como admit planning an Australian-style government gun buyback program.
[02:35:10.239 --> 02:35:13.664]  New York Governor Gun Confiscation Enforced Buy Back an Option.
[02:35:13.664 --> 02:35:14.946]  Curt Nemo.
[02:35:14.946 --> 02:35:15.647]  House Dimmed.
[02:35:15.647 --> 02:35:17.009]  Tea Party is the Real Enemy.
[02:35:17.009 --> 02:35:18.391]  They're Terrorists.
[02:35:18.391 --> 02:35:20.834]  Army Colonel Ignites Firestorm on Article.
[02:35:20.834 --> 02:35:23.919]  Army War College on Crushing a Tea Party Insurgency.
[02:35:23.919 --> 02:35:24.860]  Gun Confiscation.
[02:35:25.782 --> 02:35:26.663]  Forbes!
[02:35:26.663 --> 02:35:27.323]  How the U.S.
[02:35:27.323 --> 02:35:29.664]  military would crush a Tea Party rebellion.
[02:35:29.664 --> 02:35:30.585]  Forbes!
[02:35:30.585 --> 02:35:34.247]  Army training, domestically, to take on the Tea Party.
[02:35:34.247 --> 02:35:36.188]  Fox News, same headline.
[02:35:36.188 --> 02:35:38.910]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is only the tip of the iceberg, okay?
[02:35:38.910 --> 02:35:43.713]  Then you get this shooter, a convicted murderer, kills his grandmother with a hammer in the 80s.
[02:35:43.713 --> 02:35:44.473]  They let him go.
[02:35:44.473 --> 02:35:48.155]  He steals a Bushmaster and goes and shoots firefighters.
[02:35:48.155 --> 02:35:51.197]  Does anybody believe that?
[02:35:51.197 --> 02:35:55.420]  Just like two people are seen running away from the scene in Sandy Hook.
[02:35:58.342 --> 02:36:00.244]  And then you find a guy shot in the head inside.
[02:36:00.244 --> 02:36:01.325]  You go have a drill.
[02:36:01.325 --> 02:36:03.667]  You shoot your mental patient Patsy in the head.
[02:36:03.667 --> 02:36:04.248]  You get out.
[02:36:04.248 --> 02:36:05.128]  I mean, this is the oldest.
[02:36:05.128 --> 02:36:06.269]  This is a false flag.
[02:36:06.269 --> 02:36:07.691]  This is Operation Gladio.
[02:36:07.691 --> 02:36:09.312]  You don't know what that is, media?
[02:36:09.312 --> 02:36:10.854]  Go look it up.
[02:36:10.854 --> 02:36:17.080]  It's how our military industrial complex took European freedom over 40 years, staging mass shootings in Europe to ban their guns.
[02:36:18.479 --> 02:36:19.079]  How do you do it?
[02:36:19.079 --> 02:36:23.041]  You take a mentally ill patsy, you shoot him in the head in school, shoot a bunch of people.
[02:36:23.041 --> 02:36:24.242]  Same thing at the movie theater.
[02:36:24.242 --> 02:36:25.402]  Gladio did that.
[02:36:25.402 --> 02:36:26.743]  Blow up the school bus.
[02:36:26.743 --> 02:36:28.243]  Blame a patsy on the spot.
[02:36:28.243 --> 02:36:29.084]  Declassified.
[02:36:29.084 --> 02:36:34.186]  Let me tell you, we're getting a lot of media attention right now, folks.
[02:36:34.186 --> 02:36:35.126]  We're in danger.
[02:36:35.126 --> 02:36:37.567]  We need your prayers right now.
[02:36:37.567 --> 02:36:41.549]  Infowars.com, my entire crew, myself included.
[02:36:41.549 --> 02:36:45.251]  You better appreciate this information.
[02:36:45.251 --> 02:36:46.671]  They're pulling out every stop.
[02:36:46.671 --> 02:36:47.612]  Now, I want to take you
[02:36:49.147 --> 02:36:52.248]  To Doug Hagman.
[02:36:52.248 --> 02:36:54.169]  And I just had his bio here in front of me.
[02:36:54.169 --> 02:37:02.933]  Doug J. Hagman is the founder, director of the Northeast Intelligence Network and CEO of a multi-state licensed private investigative agency serving many Fortune 500 clients.
[02:37:02.933 --> 02:37:06.194]  27-year veteran of conducting investigations in the private sector.
[02:37:06.194 --> 02:37:07.194]  He has logged over 50,000 hours of
[02:37:09.035 --> 02:37:20.338]  Covert surveillance in his career, the author of Tactical Surveillance, he's a member of the International Counterterrorism Officers Association, has a bunch of police degrees, I'm not going to get into it all, and advises police departments around the country.
[02:37:20.338 --> 02:37:23.759]  And he's given us a lot of really good intel that's checked out over the years.
[02:37:23.759 --> 02:37:29.841]  And he put out a transcript with his DHS source saying, get ready for Obama to drop the hammer.
[02:37:29.841 --> 02:37:35.443]  And they said the plan is to go out, harass and attack gun owners, and then
[02:37:36.543 --> 02:37:38.724]  Stage stuff and just say gun owners are terrorists.
[02:37:38.724 --> 02:37:43.265]  Well, you can already see that in the admitted news.
[02:37:43.265 --> 02:37:47.266]  And you heard police officers call in and say, yeah, this is what they've been told.
[02:37:47.266 --> 02:37:48.747]  Well, I've got the training manuals.
[02:37:48.747 --> 02:37:54.389]  They say gun owners and veterans are the terrorists.
[02:37:54.389 --> 02:37:58.730]  Our government runs Al-Qaeda now, in Libya and Syria, killing people.
[02:38:01.164 --> 02:38:03.624]  Okay, I mean, the government is gone.
[02:38:03.624 --> 02:38:05.065]  We are wide open.
[02:38:05.065 --> 02:38:06.645]  Worldwide emergency.
[02:38:06.645 --> 02:38:07.325]  The U.S.
[02:38:07.325 --> 02:38:11.546]  is completely taken at the federal level by globalist foreign forces.
[02:38:11.546 --> 02:38:14.506]  We still have the media and the internet, but Doug Hagman joins us.
[02:38:14.506 --> 02:38:15.827]  Doug, I don't know if this happened to you.
[02:38:15.827 --> 02:38:17.367]  I don't even know if you have a Facebook.
[02:38:17.367 --> 02:38:26.049]  Did you know that we are tracking hundreds of Facebooks of every pro-gun group there is being shut down for any pro-gun statements?
[02:38:26.049 --> 02:38:28.069]  Mike Adams, you guys bring me that printout back in.
[02:38:29.053 --> 02:38:30.176]  Actually, here it is.
[02:38:30.176 --> 02:38:37.250]  Mike Adams was shut down for, let me show people this, among the many misdeeds of the British rule in Indian history.
[02:38:38.820 --> 02:38:42.782]  We'll look upon the act of depriving a whole nation of arms as the blackest.
[02:38:42.782 --> 02:38:49.305]  Mahatma Gandhi believed, and he quoted the Second Amendment, by the way, and that's from his autobiography, page 446.
[02:38:49.305 --> 02:38:51.466]  No speech is allowed.
[02:38:51.466 --> 02:38:52.847]  People say, oh, well, that's their website.
[02:38:52.847 --> 02:39:01.931]  No, they act as a commons, you come and give it value, post your photos, your articles, your work, and then they come in and say, you're not gonna have any pro-gun talk.
[02:39:02.651 --> 02:39:04.252]  Folks, they're moving on every front.
[02:39:04.252 --> 02:39:16.060]  This is the greatest attack and they're already announcing they're going to physically make you turn miniguns in and all the others are registered and you've got to do a level 3 type deal where you thumbprint and they can refuse you.
[02:39:16.060 --> 02:39:18.842]  That article just went up at InfoWars.com.
[02:39:18.842 --> 02:39:25.747]  Again, you've got to put out maximum effort to create the biggest counter buzz to this you ever have or it's over.
[02:39:27.130 --> 02:39:28.411]  Doug Hagman, I'm ranting here.
[02:39:28.411 --> 02:39:30.413]  You're joining us by phone on short notice.
[02:39:30.413 --> 02:39:32.895]  We'll obviously get you to pop back in tomorrow when Mike Adams is in.
[02:39:32.895 --> 02:39:34.616]  I'll be in with him part of the show as well.
[02:39:34.616 --> 02:39:35.977]  I'll be here working behind the scenes.
[02:39:35.977 --> 02:39:37.578]  I've got so much work to do.
[02:39:37.578 --> 02:39:37.819]  Doug!
[02:39:39.408 --> 02:39:45.112]  I mean, your source is confirmed because all this is already out in the open, but he gives us even more intel.
[02:39:45.112 --> 02:39:51.356]  What are we facing right now, and is there any way to stop this runaway train?
[02:39:51.356 --> 02:39:54.898]  Or has the enemy committed, and why is the enemy committing?
[02:39:54.898 --> 02:40:03.284]  Whole hog, the media is saying he's the new Lincoln, he will wage war on the states, they're calling for people to be arrested, they're calling for him to be a dictator, Reuters is.
[02:40:03.624 --> 02:40:09.667]  My God, it looks like they're going to go whole hog and stir up a race war and say you're racist if you don't turn your guns in.
[02:40:09.667 --> 02:40:13.810]  I mean, they are dropping... Are they dropping the hammer completely, Doug Hagman?
[02:40:13.810 --> 02:40:15.010]  Alex, thanks for having me.
[02:40:15.010 --> 02:40:17.011]  Number one, yes, they are dropping the hammer.
[02:40:17.011 --> 02:40:19.213]  This is not a drill.
[02:40:19.213 --> 02:40:20.673]  I mean, this is the real thing.
[02:40:20.673 --> 02:40:25.016]  I think that what we're seeing right now is the start
[02:40:25.638 --> 02:40:27.799]  Not the... I mean, this is the start.
[02:40:27.799 --> 02:40:35.001]  We haven't even seen the real worst of the beginning yet.
[02:40:35.001 --> 02:40:42.304]  There's obviously... We're seeing censorship ourselves on Facebook, on social media, networking sites.
[02:40:42.304 --> 02:40:43.624]  Our posts are being removed.
[02:40:43.624 --> 02:40:51.487]  Anything that has to do with the Second Amendment, gun rights, are being removed, as you mentioned earlier on.
[02:40:52.667 --> 02:41:00.676]  My DHS source told me that they've got no, this regime that's currently in power.
[02:41:01.560 --> 02:41:03.420]  Uh, are pulling out all of the stops.
[02:41:03.420 --> 02:41:06.441]  This is Obama's cyber order, he won't let Congress see.
[02:41:06.441 --> 02:41:09.382]  He told Congress, I signed a domestic order, you can't see it.
[02:41:09.382 --> 02:41:10.442]  That's dictator.
[02:41:10.442 --> 02:41:12.342]  I mean, they, this is it.
[02:41:12.342 --> 02:41:14.223]  Yeah, yeah, exactly right.
[02:41:14.223 --> 02:41:18.244]  And there are, we are, right now this is such an asymmetrical warfare.
[02:41:18.244 --> 02:41:24.725]  People are not understanding or comprehending, but you're doing a good job of explaining this, but people do not comprehend.
[02:41:26.246 --> 02:41:33.973]  The fronts that we are fighting, we're fighting the informational warfare, the cyber attacks, from all angles.
[02:41:33.973 --> 02:41:47.184]  But what is happening here, everything that we're seeing right now is a lie, from the economy to Benghazi, even the shootings have so much mystery surrounding them.
[02:41:47.184 --> 02:41:51.928]  And by the way, Alex, according to my DHS source, expect
[02:41:52.875 --> 02:41:53.195]  I think
[02:42:14.944 --> 02:42:18.926]  His advice to me is research it, you will find things that are not right with it.
[02:42:18.926 --> 02:42:26.009]  Well it's the same deal, they've got stables of mental patients in psychiatric care wound up being given the weapons right now.
[02:42:26.009 --> 02:42:30.732]  And they're advertising, hey you're a crazy person, go to a school, murder, murder, it's the new thing to do.
[02:42:31.721 --> 02:42:39.947]  Yeah, there's a lot wrong, I have to tell you this, there's a lot wrong with Sandy Hook with that situation, with all due respect to the victims there.
[02:42:39.947 --> 02:42:53.358]  There's a lot wrong with that situation, but the important part of this is to expect at least one more incident to really solidify in the minds of people that these big bad assault rifles
[02:42:54.402 --> 02:42:56.464]  A misnomer, to be sure.
[02:42:56.464 --> 02:42:58.805]  Or not to be in the hands of the American people.
[02:42:58.805 --> 02:43:00.746]  Go over what they're planning to do.
[02:43:00.746 --> 02:43:03.128]  Because again, they're getting ready to collapse the economy.
[02:43:03.128 --> 02:43:04.929]  They can't have us armed while that happens.
[02:43:04.929 --> 02:43:10.492]  Plus, from my research, this is their excuse to go after gun owners and call us the new terrorists.
[02:43:10.492 --> 02:43:13.954]  The entire real architecture of Homeland was set up for that.
[02:43:13.954 --> 02:43:15.135]  The cover was Al Qaeda.
[02:43:15.811 --> 02:43:16.312]  Exactly.
[02:43:16.312 --> 02:43:23.885]  And you just said it, Doug, that they are not necessarily interested in shutting down social media or the internet.
[02:43:23.885 --> 02:43:28.574]  They're using social media to demonize people like you, people like me, people anybody who speaks up.
[02:43:29.082 --> 02:43:33.424]  For the right to bear arms, for the right of free speech, by the way.
[02:43:33.424 --> 02:43:37.905]  Amendments 1 and 2 are linked, and they're going after both of them.
[02:43:37.905 --> 02:43:44.447]  As we're seeing right now, as we're seeing it play out, obviously they want to take our guns, and they want to shut us up.
[02:43:44.447 --> 02:43:46.348]  And they're doing both simultaneously.
[02:43:47.478 --> 02:44:01.749]  Anyone reporting on journalism, speaking out against government policies, anyone who protests anything that is antithetical to this regime will be shut up and censored, if you will.
[02:44:01.749 --> 02:44:14.860]  And not only that, but according to my source, put on a list, if you will, because when the money supplier, when the economy collapses, when the dollar collapses, when we can no longer buy anything,
[02:44:16.981 --> 02:44:32.092]  The very first people to go, according to my source, the very first people to be rounded up, the very first targets, if you will, on the radar of this regime, are the people that are speaking the truth about what's taking place.
[02:44:32.092 --> 02:44:37.716]  Alex Jones, Doug Hagman, others like us, who are getting to the heart of the matter.
[02:44:37.716 --> 02:44:40.338]  We are the targets for not only the censorship,
[02:44:41.007 --> 02:44:52.413]  But for what's coming after that, what's coming after that is the actual, the physical part of it to take us out of the fight before it really begins.
[02:44:52.413 --> 02:44:56.895]  And look at how they butchered the entire Bill of Rights and Constitution from one end to the other.
[02:44:56.895 --> 02:44:58.536]  Of course they're going to come after the guns.
[02:44:59.176 --> 02:45:00.877]  And you look at the collectivist left.
[02:45:00.877 --> 02:45:02.718]  These are conscious authoritarians.
[02:45:02.718 --> 02:45:04.278]  These aren't even leftists.
[02:45:04.278 --> 02:45:13.282]  These are just monstrous creatures that think they're on the winning team and think tyranny and torture is sexy.
[02:45:13.282 --> 02:45:17.004]  This will cause resistance, which is part of their plan as well.
[02:45:17.004 --> 02:45:20.085]  The rebranding of gun owners as terrorists.
[02:45:20.085 --> 02:45:22.166]  I took a lot of calls from police and military.
[02:45:22.166 --> 02:45:23.947]  Most of them are awake.
[02:45:23.947 --> 02:45:26.608]  Do you see this going the way the globalists plan?
[02:45:27.594 --> 02:45:38.997]  Well, I think ultimately, and I was told that they have run models, computer models, to anticipate various outcomes.
[02:45:38.997 --> 02:45:50.840]  And they expect a greater than average acquiescence by gun owners so that they are not brandished as criminals who possess semi-automatic weapons.
[02:45:50.840 --> 02:45:54.181]  And by the way, these semi-automatic weapons
[02:45:55.121 --> 02:46:04.003]  Will include, according to my source, any pistol, semi-automatic pistol, as well as the so-called assault rifle.
[02:46:04.003 --> 02:46:05.023]  That's right.
[02:46:05.023 --> 02:46:05.963]  They've done their studies.
[02:46:05.963 --> 02:46:12.285]  They think the American people are cowards and are afraid, so they'll roll over and then the Dark Knight begins.
[02:46:12.285 --> 02:46:15.446]  As they told us, the Dark Knight was coming, didn't they, in their little film.
[02:46:15.446 --> 02:46:17.866]  And so this is their time to rise.
[02:46:17.866 --> 02:46:19.506]  This is their fire going up.
[02:46:19.506 --> 02:46:20.687]  This is their attack on us.
[02:46:22.667 --> 02:46:27.110]  Uh, and they're going to take the pension funds, the private property, they're going to do the forced inoculations.
[02:46:27.110 --> 02:46:27.911]  It's already begun.
[02:46:27.911 --> 02:46:29.132]  They're just going to do whatever they want.
[02:46:29.132 --> 02:46:29.832]  This is their time.
[02:46:52.247 --> 02:46:53.068]  The way it is.
[02:46:53.068 --> 02:47:00.313]  And any gun owner that defends themselves, just like in England, if you defend yourself with your fist in your own home, you're thrown into prison for decades.
[02:47:00.313 --> 02:47:05.457]  Just the savage state viciously attacking any form of self-defense.
[02:47:05.457 --> 02:47:15.445]  Just a hell... And Bloomberg telling you what to eat and just... And force-feeding kids GMO while keeping them down to 860 calories a day.
[02:47:15.445 --> 02:47:16.866]  Starvation level.
[02:47:16.866 --> 02:47:21.850]  Just America, a giant re-education hive run by gibbering control freaks.
[02:47:22.190 --> 02:47:25.191]  Screaming you're a racist if you don't bow to them.
[02:47:25.191 --> 02:47:26.272]  Exactly.
[02:47:26.272 --> 02:47:32.015]  And you know, people, my DHS source, people say, well, you know, Americans won't take this.
[02:47:32.015 --> 02:47:40.459]  Well, look at what Americans are subjecting themselves to and allowing themselves to be subjected to at airports, you know, with the TSA.
[02:47:40.459 --> 02:47:41.919]  Where's the outrage over that?
[02:47:41.919 --> 02:47:45.321]  Well, you know, what's the average American's line at the stand?
[02:47:45.321 --> 02:47:51.524]  Is it going to be the registration of the weapons, the confiscation of the weapons, the criminalization of the weapons?
[02:47:52.148 --> 02:47:55.871]  You know, at what point, at what point, what's the line?
[02:47:55.871 --> 02:47:57.773]  What's the tripwire here?
[02:47:57.773 --> 02:48:00.855]  And once again, according to my source, there have been models run.
[02:48:00.855 --> 02:48:16.228]  They do expect a certain amount of resistance, but they feel that, and I suppose to a degree, I agree, that there are a lot of people with virtual muscles, like beer muscles, that will post on the internet, like, well, they're not going to take my gun.
[02:48:16.228 --> 02:48:17.790]  Well, look what happened within Katrina.
[02:48:17.790 --> 02:48:19.331]  I mean, how many shots were fired?
[02:48:20.402 --> 02:48:22.444]  Uh, when the gun confiscation took place.
[02:48:22.444 --> 02:48:24.485]  No, the globalists are calling the bluff.
[02:48:24.485 --> 02:48:26.406]  They're gonna take everything.
[02:48:26.406 --> 02:48:28.188]  And the mainline Republicans are gonna lie.
[02:48:28.188 --> 02:48:33.872]  That's the big sign how much trouble we're in, is all these congressional Republicans coming out and saying, let's turn the guns in.
[02:48:34.710 --> 02:48:35.651]  Exactly.
[02:48:35.651 --> 02:48:42.758]  I mean the TV shows being cancelled, the biggest gun manufacturer announcing sale or shutdown, I mean this is it.
[02:48:42.758 --> 02:48:55.770]  They've been told, the executive, well it's not my intel, they've said Obama's looking at an executive order, he'll use his commission as the cover, it's totally illegal, and then once they've done that they're just going to take everything else.
[02:48:55.770 --> 02:48:56.711]  It's just going to be horrible.
[02:48:58.097 --> 02:49:05.560]  It will be, and people I don't think have a complete understanding, Alex, of how horrible it will be.
[02:49:05.560 --> 02:49:12.442]  We're talking about an oppression like this country has never seen before, you know, and once again,
[02:49:19.068 --> 02:49:26.690]  I predict about 10% aren't going to look for trouble, but when it comes they'll defend, and I predict about 1.5% are going to go on the offensive.
[02:49:26.690 --> 02:49:30.811]  But that's part of the plan to start the Civil War, to brand gun owners as terrorists.
[02:49:30.811 --> 02:49:32.891]  I mean, the globalists are just pure evil.
[02:49:32.891 --> 02:49:34.712]  People aren't sophisticated enough to get it.
[02:49:34.712 --> 02:49:37.972]  The cops aren't, the public isn't, and so the foreign bankers will get it.
[02:49:37.972 --> 02:49:40.533]  I mean, I tell you, I would not want to be a cop though, I'll tell you that right now.
[02:49:41.073 --> 02:49:42.254]  No, no, no.
[02:49:42.254 --> 02:49:49.821]  And that was discussed, too, about where the cops lie or where the police officers lie in this, what their position might be.
[02:49:49.821 --> 02:50:02.732]  And also, I've been hearing, too, of the expansion of the TSA commission, to make TSA officers commissioned to assist in the confiscation, if necessary, which is just totally absurd.
[02:50:03.308 --> 02:50:03.708]  No, no, no.
[02:50:03.708 --> 02:50:05.550]  They put them in all 50 states.
[02:50:05.550 --> 02:50:08.132]  Well, I keep saying last year, like it's 2013.
[02:50:08.132 --> 02:50:13.636]  This year, they deployed to all 50 states big caches for their sleeper teams.
[02:50:13.636 --> 02:50:17.219]  I mean, they're already ready to stand up, as they call it, the military.
[02:50:17.219 --> 02:50:23.063]  And they've got all these, you know, 72-hour stand-up programs for FEMA camps.
[02:50:23.063 --> 02:50:24.365]  That's all official.
[02:50:24.365 --> 02:50:25.085]  Billions a year.
[02:50:25.085 --> 02:50:25.826]  I mean, they're ready.
[02:50:25.826 --> 02:50:31.370]  They're just gonna, they just cannot wait to arrest people, knock our teeth out, torture us, rape our wives.
[02:50:31.370 --> 02:50:32.251]  I mean, it is just hell.
[02:50:32.901 --> 02:50:38.405]  Well, and you make a good point, because they're really not only coming after our guns, but they're coming after us.
[02:50:38.405 --> 02:50:52.895]  And that sounds like a really, uh... Oh, no, they're gonna bomb police stations and blame it on us, and, you know, the cops will get all mad and run out and kill a bunch of patriots, and patriots will kill them, and then the globalists will sit back and laugh, and just, it'll be a great fun.
[02:50:52.895 --> 02:50:54.316]  Total takeover of America.
[02:50:54.316 --> 02:50:56.458]  Front row seats to gun confiscation.
[02:50:56.458 --> 02:50:56.878]  Get ready.
[02:50:56.878 --> 02:50:57.718]  Hope you all enjoy it.
[02:50:57.718 --> 02:50:58.099]  We'll be back.
[02:51:01.223 --> 02:51:05.766]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:51:05.766 --> 02:51:06.687]  Number one.
[02:51:06.687 --> 02:51:10.110]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:51:10.110 --> 02:51:10.970]  Number two.
[02:51:10.970 --> 02:51:15.854]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:51:15.854 --> 02:51:16.614]  It's true.
[02:51:16.614 --> 02:51:21.478]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:51:21.478 --> 02:51:22.299]  Number three.
[02:51:22.299 --> 02:51:25.901]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:51:25.901 --> 02:51:29.584]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:51:29.784 --> 02:51:30.585]  Number 4.
[02:51:30.585 --> 02:51:33.347]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:51:33.347 --> 02:51:37.031]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:51:37.031 --> 02:51:37.832]  Number 5.
[02:51:37.832 --> 02:51:41.975]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:51:41.975 --> 02:51:46.740]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:54:04.582 --> 02:54:15.872]  The preacher man says it's the end of time and the Mississippi River, she's a gold drive.
[02:54:15.872 --> 02:54:21.837]  The interest is up and the stock market's down and you're only getting mugged if you go downtown.
[02:54:27.567 --> 02:54:32.490]  America is in a coma.
[02:54:32.490 --> 02:54:38.575]  And the globalists know, if you've got guns, that means you don't trust the system, that means you're prepared, that means you know how to fight.
[02:54:38.575 --> 02:54:40.436]  This is a takeover!
[02:54:40.436 --> 02:54:43.758]  It's a world government being announced!
[02:54:43.758 --> 02:54:45.979]  Do you understand that?
[02:54:45.979 --> 02:54:52.344]  Because they can't starve us out and they can't make us run because these good old boys were raised on shotguns.
[02:54:52.344 --> 02:54:53.965]  Let's go to a police officer, Eric.
[02:54:55.234 --> 02:55:02.601]  In California, listening on the free Android app, and we got Doug Hagman on with us right now via phone.
[02:55:02.601 --> 02:55:11.510]  And I just, look, once they start killing a bunch of cops, and then blaming it on us, or having cops confiscate guns and then cops do get killed, it's on.
[02:55:11.510 --> 02:55:12.151]  It's gonna be war.
[02:55:14.057 --> 02:55:18.841]  And the police in mob mentality will just start going after any patriots.
[02:55:18.841 --> 02:55:20.943]  Patriots will just start going after any police.
[02:55:20.943 --> 02:55:23.945]  While the globalists sit back offshore laughing.
[02:55:23.945 --> 02:55:25.006]  I don't know how we stop this.
[02:55:25.006 --> 02:55:26.527]  I want to talk to Doug about that in a moment.
[02:55:26.527 --> 02:55:27.888]  But Eric, thanks for holding.
[02:55:27.888 --> 02:55:30.070]  What's your take on all this?
[02:55:30.070 --> 02:55:30.551]  Hey, buddy.
[02:55:30.551 --> 02:55:31.171]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:55:31.171 --> 02:55:32.012]  Honored to talk to you.
[02:55:32.012 --> 02:55:33.233]  Honored to meet you, man.
[02:55:33.233 --> 02:55:34.134]  Nice to talk to you.
[02:55:34.134 --> 02:55:35.275]  People ask how I'm doing.
[02:55:35.275 --> 02:55:39.818]  I'm fighting my instincts to just not evacuate this country.
[02:55:39.818 --> 02:55:40.299]  But go ahead.
[02:55:41.696 --> 02:55:47.818]  Yeah, I mean, my take on this whole thing is, uh, I gotta tell you, I was around for the LA riots and all that.
[02:55:47.818 --> 02:55:51.779]  And, uh, guess what, uh, guess what gave the police the upper hand in that?
[02:55:51.779 --> 02:55:53.739]  Store owners armed.
[02:55:53.739 --> 02:55:57.200]  Legal store owners law-abiding citizens with guns.
[02:55:57.200 --> 02:55:58.300]  That's what helped us.
[02:55:58.300 --> 02:55:58.600]  You know?
[02:55:58.600 --> 02:56:01.881]  I don't know why the media and the government doesn't want you to know this.
[02:56:01.881 --> 02:56:02.641]  Well, I do know why.
[02:56:02.641 --> 02:56:04.782]  Because they don't want us to have guns.
[02:56:04.782 --> 02:56:05.462]  They want to take them.
[02:56:06.403 --> 02:56:10.447]  Yeah, California's basically pushing a bureaucratic ban right now.
[02:56:10.447 --> 02:56:12.148]  There's never enough for these people.
[02:56:12.148 --> 02:56:17.032]  What is your take on, from every angle, they're gearing up for a civil war?
[02:56:17.032 --> 02:56:20.636]  Are police in this country going to let them start a civil war?
[02:56:20.636 --> 02:56:24.199]  Because I guarantee you, there's a percentage of people that aren't turning them in.
[02:56:25.962 --> 02:56:27.663]  Yeah, well, exactly.
[02:56:27.663 --> 02:56:33.245]  And the thing is, the police, the police are going to be caught in the middle, almost, as, you know, what side do they take?
[02:56:33.245 --> 02:56:36.727]  Because, you know, obviously they're government, we're government officials.
[02:56:36.727 --> 02:56:40.268]  But on the other hand, we are, COP is citizen on patrol.
[02:56:40.268 --> 02:56:41.709]  We are citizens.
[02:56:41.709 --> 02:56:42.249]  You understand?
[02:56:42.249 --> 02:56:45.910]  We're not... Well, you're not supposed to execute illegal orders either.
[02:56:45.910 --> 02:56:47.951]  I mean, look, we got a constitution.
[02:56:47.951 --> 02:56:51.813]  If Obama signs an executive order saying we've all got to lick his boots, do we have to do that?
[02:56:53.095 --> 02:56:54.136]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:56:54.136 --> 02:56:55.176]  I would hope not.
[02:56:55.176 --> 02:56:57.178]  I surely would hope not.
[02:56:57.178 --> 02:57:01.140]  Are other police you talk to concerned about this?
[02:57:01.140 --> 02:57:02.000]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:08.324]  And the thing that's concerning us the most is now we can't even, we don't even have free speech.
[02:57:08.324 --> 02:57:13.587]  Like you were saying, I know people that have gone suspended without pay for saying, quote, not the right thing on Facebook.
[02:57:13.587 --> 02:57:15.108]  It's disgusting, Alex.
[02:57:15.108 --> 02:57:19.491]  This country's become, we're like USA, we're getting to North Korea, we're getting there.
[02:57:19.491 --> 02:57:21.172]  Couple more steps and we'll be there.
[02:57:21.172 --> 02:57:22.273]  Anything else you'd like to add, sir?
[02:57:23.779 --> 02:57:28.842]  Um, I would just like to say thank you for the opportunity, and it was great finally being on the show.
[02:57:28.842 --> 02:57:30.864]  I've been calling in every day for months now.
[02:57:30.864 --> 02:57:31.964]  It's good to finally get through.
[02:57:31.964 --> 02:57:34.025]  Well, God bless you, and thanks for putting up with me.
[02:57:34.025 --> 02:57:38.708]  Doug, we're going to break here in a little bit longer, but I mean, is there any way to avert this?
[02:57:38.708 --> 02:57:43.871]  It's clear they create crises, order out of chaos, problem, reaction, solution.
[02:57:43.871 --> 02:57:45.412]  They want to start a civil war.
[02:57:45.412 --> 02:57:46.213]  How do we stop it?
[02:57:46.906 --> 02:57:56.161]  Well, aside from what we're doing in informing the populace, there's one way, and I'm not sure if it could be pulled off, Alex, and that is stop feeding the beast.
[02:57:56.161 --> 02:57:59.687]  What people in Poland did, they stopped working.
[02:57:59.687 --> 02:58:01.289]  They stopped paying taxes.
[02:58:02.333 --> 02:58:07.638]  And I think that would, of anything, that would get the... That's it!
[02:58:07.638 --> 02:58:08.919]  That hit me last night.
[02:58:08.919 --> 02:58:10.980]  I mean, we all know this, but it hit me last night.
[02:58:10.980 --> 02:58:14.984]  We all of us have to stop non-compliance any way we can.
[02:58:14.984 --> 02:58:16.004]  I agree.
[02:58:16.004 --> 02:58:18.667]  And not just money-wise, but verbally.
[02:58:18.667 --> 02:58:20.148]  Give it no support.
[02:58:20.148 --> 02:58:20.969]  You see what I'm saying?
[02:58:20.969 --> 02:58:23.771]  That's right.
[02:58:23.771 --> 02:58:24.491]  You got it.
[02:58:24.491 --> 02:58:25.692]  Stay there for a moment.
[02:58:25.692 --> 02:58:28.174]  These corrupt... You heard the police officer.
[02:58:28.174 --> 02:58:30.717]  You say something pro-Second Amendment, you're suspended without pay.
[02:58:32.403 --> 02:58:37.667]  You see how they, they're a bunch of authoritarians, censoring everybody.
[02:58:37.667 --> 02:58:40.109]  Use the internet while we've still got it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:58:40.109 --> 02:58:47.014]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:47.014 --> 02:58:49.216]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:53.444 --> 02:58:59.027]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[02:58:59.027 --> 02:59:02.268]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[02:59:02.268 --> 02:59:05.090]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[02:59:05.090 --> 02:59:08.111]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[02:59:08.111 --> 02:59:11.613]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[02:59:11.613 --> 02:59:16.815]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[02:59:16.815 --> 02:59:19.496]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.
[02:59:19.496 --> 02:59:22.518]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[02:59:23.138 --> 02:59:25.259]  I'm taking control of my future.
[02:59:25.259 --> 02:59:26.899]  And you're nuts if you don't do the same.
[02:59:26.899 --> 02:59:30.820]  Go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials.
[02:59:30.820 --> 02:59:35.241]  And you can start with a holiday gift pack that's normally $80, now under $50.
[02:59:35.241 --> 02:59:38.422]  Remember, I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[02:59:38.422 --> 02:59:43.204]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:59:43.204 --> 02:59:46.325]  Would you rather prepare six months too early or one day too late?
[02:59:46.325 --> 02:59:48.985]  409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:59:52.952 --> 02:59:56.539]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:56.539 --> 02:59:59.745]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:26.220 --> 03:00:43.923]  Ladies and gentlemen, history is repeating itself right now.
[03:00:43.923 --> 03:00:47.243]  And you better get angry and you better get motivated.
[03:00:47.243 --> 03:00:49.984]  Because the globalists believe the time to drop the hammer is now.
[03:00:54.892 --> 03:01:02.476]  Let's go ahead and go back to Mr. Hagman of the Northeast Intelligence Network and give out your website for folks as well, sir.
[03:01:02.476 --> 03:01:05.257]  I agree with you.
[03:01:05.257 --> 03:01:10.980]  It is time to absolutely make this everybody's full-time job.
[03:01:10.980 --> 03:01:13.101]  People think of fighting tyranny as work.
[03:01:13.101 --> 03:01:14.121]  It's survival.
[03:01:14.121 --> 03:01:17.663]  It's an instinct to get your hackles up about this.
[03:01:17.663 --> 03:01:20.544]  I mean, these globalists are as nasty as they come.
[03:01:24.013 --> 03:01:29.500]  Are you seeing it wake people up that they admit in the New York Times our government now runs Al Qaeda?
[03:01:29.500 --> 03:01:32.584]  I mean, does that not give credibility to the things I've always broke down?
[03:01:32.584 --> 03:01:36.429]  That it's a synthetic terror group they control because it's not our government?
[03:01:36.429 --> 03:01:39.653]  I mean, they're now announcing world government everywhere.
[03:01:39.653 --> 03:01:41.175]  What about the Feds, you know?
[03:01:41.175 --> 03:01:42.596]  I mean, are they going to go along with this?
[03:01:43.820 --> 03:01:45.721]  Well, great questions.
[03:01:45.721 --> 03:01:47.503]  First of all, let me say this.
[03:01:47.503 --> 03:02:00.913]  I probably could be the barometer of the average person, 30 years as an investigator, always believing that things are just the way they are, listening to you and not really, not really hearing your message.
[03:02:00.913 --> 03:02:08.799]  And then suddenly, well not suddenly, but incrementally over the years, waking up and realizing, hey,
[03:02:09.269 --> 03:02:37.886]  We're living one big lie, and then once you hit that realization, then you see how society is broken down, that the people who are just stuck in that normalcy bias and think everything is normal, or that don't want to deal with it, and then the other side of that are the people that are saying, you know what, Alex Jones, he's right, he's been right, and I'm one of those people who took a long time to wake up, but now once awake, it is our duty, I believe,
[03:02:38.576 --> 03:02:50.901]  Now, to not only inform and educate others, but to pick a side, to work a plan, to get a plan and work a plan to fight this tyranny, to join ranks.
[03:02:50.901 --> 03:03:02.245]  I mean, Alex, I'll tell you what, everywhere I go I mention InfoWars and I promote your information because you have been right all along.
[03:03:02.245 --> 03:03:07.006]  It's just a matter of maturing mentally, intellectually.
[03:03:07.006 --> 03:03:08.387]  Not that you need my endorsement, but
[03:03:08.601 --> 03:03:11.723]  But listen, yeah, I just want to get our freedom back.
[03:03:11.723 --> 03:03:12.784]  I wish I was wrong.
[03:03:12.784 --> 03:03:18.307]  You know, it's a very sick feeling to study history, to see it repeating and to be right.
[03:03:18.307 --> 03:03:21.088]  It's like walking outside and seeing the sunrises and there's a sunrise.
[03:03:21.088 --> 03:03:22.349]  It's not hard.
[03:03:22.349 --> 03:03:24.751]  It's frustrating now that it's all coming true.
[03:03:24.751 --> 03:03:28.533]  I mean, and it's like people better.
[03:03:28.533 --> 03:03:30.114]  What about the feds you talk to?
[03:03:30.114 --> 03:03:32.015]  I mean, is there nothing they're not going to go along with?
[03:03:32.506 --> 03:03:35.648]  No, they're split, like society.
[03:03:35.648 --> 03:03:48.955]  I mean, the people that I've talked to are God-fearing men who understand what's happening, who, for reasons including attempting to throw the fly in the ointment themselves,
[03:03:49.965 --> 03:03:50.606]  Sure, sure.
[03:03:50.606 --> 03:03:53.988]  What about the billing of him as Lincoln and he will crush the states?
[03:03:53.988 --> 03:03:56.289]  I mean, they've had this plan for a while.
[03:03:56.289 --> 03:03:56.809]  This is incredible.
[03:04:17.765 --> 03:04:19.346]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:04:19.346 --> 03:04:25.808]  See, and people are just... And here's the thing, I guess, in a nutshell.
[03:04:25.808 --> 03:04:28.588]  This has been going on for decades.
[03:04:28.588 --> 03:04:34.770]  We are now seeing the actual hubris and seeing everything play out right now.
[03:04:34.770 --> 03:04:36.111]  We're seeing the endgame.
[03:04:36.111 --> 03:04:37.411]  We're seeing the endgame.
[03:04:37.411 --> 03:04:38.332]  Fire out your website.
[03:04:38.332 --> 03:04:40.512]  We'll have to have you pop back in tomorrow if you can.
[03:04:40.512 --> 03:04:41.933]  Fire out your website.
[03:04:41.933 --> 03:04:45.334]  It's HomelandSecurityUS.com and CanadaFreePress.com.
[03:04:46.328 --> 03:04:46.668]  All right.
[03:04:46.668 --> 03:04:47.570]  God bless you, my friend.
[03:04:47.570 --> 03:04:48.070]  We're out of time.
[03:04:48.070 --> 03:04:55.459]  Let me talk to you right now and try to set you up for an update with myself and Mike Adams, who's sitting in most of the show, but I'll be in studio with him as well tomorrow.
[03:04:55.459 --> 03:04:58.423]  Nightly News Tonight will have a special report within that.
[03:04:58.423 --> 03:05:00.706]  I'll be doing that tonight, 7 o'clock Central, PrisonPlanet.TV.
