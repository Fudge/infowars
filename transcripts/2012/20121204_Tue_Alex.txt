[00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.443]  You know, it seems like I say this at the start of every broadcast, because it's true!
[00:00:32.478 --> 00:00:44.248]  I sit here looking at all this news and I just marvel, marvel at what is going on and how fast the tyranny is moving, not just here in the U.S., but worldwide.
[00:00:44.248 --> 00:00:50.394]  At the same time, the awakening to what is going on is happening, but you've got all these criminal interests
[00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:56.950]  That are running the government and some of the major corporations and they're made up of individuals.
[00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.834]  They're bound together for their lust for global domination.
[00:00:59.834 --> 00:01:02.597]  But the individuals just don't care if they're getting caught.
[00:01:02.597 --> 00:01:04.740]  They don't care if they even get in trouble.
[00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.782]  It's kind of a feeding frenzy of evil.
[00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:11.649]  And despotism and looting.
[00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:14.471]  What you tend to see before things fully collapse.
[00:01:14.471 --> 00:01:19.214]  And they've got plans to consolidate power during that collapse.
[00:01:19.214 --> 00:01:29.600]  And the plan is a police state so that we are converted from being a wealthy western world to being a third world slash old world tyranny.
[00:01:30.765 --> 00:01:33.506]  The news is obviously off the chart.
[00:01:33.506 --> 00:01:36.348]  And what I said yesterday is now being borne out to be accurate.
[00:01:36.348 --> 00:01:45.373]  This is the first salvo by the new larger majority of the good old demo rats in the Senate.
[00:01:45.373 --> 00:01:52.516]  And El Presidente, who has shown he doesn't even care what the Congress does on any issue, this is dictatorial.
[00:01:52.516 --> 00:01:55.678]  Obama is by all measurements now a dictator.
[00:01:57.202 --> 00:02:00.523]  And he's acting in a dictatorial fashion.
[00:02:00.523 --> 00:02:02.984]  That's not disputed.
[00:02:02.984 --> 00:02:15.729]  And they are announcing they're going after all semi-auto handguns and rifles, and quote, inexpensive firearms, and quote, firearms that can be converted, and basically everything.
[00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:18.030]  They are coming for our guns.
[00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.691]  And people say, well, there's no way they'll do that.
[00:02:19.691 --> 00:02:20.331]  Oh, yes, they will.
[00:02:21.218 --> 00:02:23.719]  Yes, they will.
[00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:33.424]  They will implode the economy, bring us into a depression, launch some hardcore wars, and say you're basically terrorists if you don't hand them in, and blow up federal buildings and blame it on patriots.
[00:02:33.424 --> 00:02:37.546]  Now, that is in the New World Order.
[00:02:38.937 --> 00:02:57.846]  Crime syndicate management team known as the Obama administration, that group of coaches running this crime syndicate team, their favorite plays are staged terror attacks, staged crises to be blamed on Americans that love freedom and understand they're a bunch of criminals.
[00:02:57.846 --> 00:02:58.867]  And they are planning
[00:02:59.884 --> 00:03:03.066]  To absolutely stage all sorts of stuff.
[00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:07.209]  This Attorney General was intimately involved in the cover-up of Oklahoma City.
[00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.531]  We know Clinton's people carried it out.
[00:03:09.531 --> 00:03:10.812]  That's been proven.
[00:03:10.812 --> 00:03:14.675]  It's covered in the film I'm in, Noble Lie, all the documentation.
[00:03:14.675 --> 00:03:23.841]  Expanding on that, if you go out from that point, this Attorney General staged Fast and Furious to blame the Second Amendment.
[00:03:23.841 --> 00:03:25.282]  He was Deputy Attorney General then in 95.
[00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.973]  And you can see all the pre-programming, all the conditioning, all of it, moving into that.
[00:03:31.973 --> 00:03:34.315]  And now they're not facing re-election.
[00:03:34.315 --> 00:03:41.582]  Now they've got the media, the corporate media, basically going along with anything they want or anything they push.
[00:03:43.118 --> 00:03:50.869]  And we are moving into that sector of maximum threat of false flags sooner rather than later.
[00:03:50.869 --> 00:04:00.041]  Now, let's be clear, exposing the false flag threat paradigm, the inside job, self-inflicted wound,
[00:04:01.508 --> 00:04:06.671]  Stage terror event, exposing the frame up, may actually derail it.
[00:04:06.671 --> 00:04:11.475]  Or if they go ahead and stage it, we've now got our people everywhere and that's what scares them.
[00:04:11.475 --> 00:04:15.417]  There were patriots that picked up on what happened with Oklahoma City and exposed it day one.
[00:04:15.417 --> 00:04:18.279]  They had to kill some cops and other people to cover it up.
[00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:22.542]  And we've had their families and others on the show to break it down.
[00:04:22.542 --> 00:04:26.585]  At the same time, now when they have an underwear bomber, we instantly have
[00:04:27.933 --> 00:04:28.393]  We're good to go.
[00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:10.337]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.

[00:07:01.271 --> 00:07:06.853]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[00:07:06.853 --> 00:07:10.095]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[00:07:10.095 --> 00:07:12.916]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[00:07:12.916 --> 00:07:15.917]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[00:07:15.917 --> 00:07:18.938]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[00:07:19.438 --> 00:07:24.645]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect and I recommend you do the same.

[00:08:03.169 --> 00:08:04.530]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:08:26.562 --> 00:08:28.544]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:28.544 --> 00:08:31.286]  It is already the fourth day of December 2012.
[00:08:31.286 --> 00:08:43.297]  Our news websites are InfoWars.com, InfoWarsNews.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:08:43.297 --> 00:08:46.980]  That's just some of our news sites out there.
[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.183]  We've got a ton of reports that I will get into.
[00:08:51.164 --> 00:09:12.902]  Dealing today with the fact that mainstream media worldwide, that is corporate, state-run, globalist, bankster-controlled, New World Order, cartel, crime syndicate, mouthpiece, propagandist, dehumanizing, weaponized, brainwashing systems that spew sass and distorted propaganda at us 24-7 are imploding in mass.
[00:09:13.482 --> 00:09:28.735]  Worldwide, the route of these people is accelerating, while the alternative media in all of its stripes is turbo-surging, exploding, going mega-supernova.
[00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:34.900]  Now, in fact, just because I mention that, let me just give you some of those headlines here.
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:38.083]  TheWeek.com, the New York Times latest cutbacks proof.
[00:09:39.252 --> 00:09:42.193]  It's digital strategy is failing.
[00:09:42.193 --> 00:09:43.653]  French news agency.
[00:09:43.653 --> 00:09:45.513]  Murdoch iPad daily failure.
[00:09:45.513 --> 00:09:48.094]  A lesson for digital news.
[00:09:48.094 --> 00:09:51.334]  Murdoch's the daily to shut down.
[00:09:51.334 --> 00:09:53.475]  Kurtz.
[00:09:53.475 --> 00:09:55.315]  Worry about fate of CNN.
[00:09:55.315 --> 00:09:57.596]  Last bastion of television journalism.
[00:09:57.596 --> 00:10:00.956]  You mean CIA run?
[00:10:00.956 --> 00:10:01.316]  Belcher.
[00:10:01.316 --> 00:10:03.277]  We're going to be getting into some of that.
[00:10:04.417 --> 00:10:07.238]  And then I've got other articles here, speaking of propaganda.
[00:10:07.238 --> 00:10:08.098]  Yeah, that's news.
[00:10:08.098 --> 00:10:16.141]  What's not dying is propaganda in Hollywood movies and sitcoms and dramas, paid for with taxpayer money.
[00:10:16.141 --> 00:10:23.824]  Tens of billions of dollars a year, on record, spent to put anti-gun, anti-family, pro-abortion, anti-male.
[00:10:23.824 --> 00:10:27.865]  I mean, you see all these messages in dramas, sitcoms, medical dramas.
[00:10:29.841 --> 00:10:30.902]  It's everything.
[00:10:30.902 --> 00:10:40.128]  My wife tries to watch television sometimes and she says every show she watches is just, you know, you're a terrorist if you don't want to take vaccines.
[00:10:40.128 --> 00:10:42.930]  Anybody who's a homeschooler is a child molester.
[00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:45.091]  Ron Paul is a drug addict.
[00:10:45.091 --> 00:10:46.452]  Just on and on and on.
[00:10:46.452 --> 00:10:51.996]  Yeah, that's government run by foreign banks engaging in psyops against you.
[00:10:51.996 --> 00:10:54.157]  And that's not rhetoric I just put out.
[00:10:54.157 --> 00:10:56.099]  That's what it is!
[00:10:56.099 --> 00:10:57.480]  That is sensational!
[00:10:58.271 --> 00:11:01.354]  But we've got this normalcy bias.
[00:11:01.354 --> 00:11:04.398]  Here it is, new film critics.
[00:11:04.398 --> 00:11:06.400]  Zero Dark Thirty named best film.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.821]  Lincoln wins multiple honors.
[00:11:08.846 --> 00:11:12.489]  All of this Lincoln stuff is getting everybody ready for a Federalist takeover.
[00:11:12.489 --> 00:11:14.411]  When these people are actually anti-Federalist.
[00:11:14.411 --> 00:11:16.432]  And then you've got Zero Dark Easter Bunny.
[00:11:16.432 --> 00:11:18.354]  I mean, a total fable.
[00:11:18.354 --> 00:11:21.096]  And then the White House is involved in the production.
[00:11:21.096 --> 00:11:24.519]  And there's the beautiful redhead with the spec ops guys.
[00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:25.880]  And oh, they're so incredible.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:26.741]  And there's Superman.
[00:11:26.741 --> 00:11:29.043]  All pure bull.
[00:11:31.513 --> 00:11:34.355]  Just absolute baloney.
[00:11:34.355 --> 00:11:55.553]  I mean, they might as well have a movie, literally, where a Easter Bunny with a halo flies in from deep space as a Chinese jet pilot, lands, disgorges a hundred Keebler elves, and takes out a seven-headed Hydra dragon laying golden eggs in Obamabot.
[00:11:55.553 --> 00:11:57.655]  Jack and the Beanstalk, whatever you want.
[00:11:57.655 --> 00:11:59.557]  Fables, fairy tales, Hansel and Gretel.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.581]  The tortoise and the hare.
[00:12:02.581 --> 00:12:03.521]  Santa Claus.
[00:12:03.521 --> 00:12:06.121]  I mean, it isn't real, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:06.121 --> 00:12:11.483]  And they blew up one helicopter full of seals to shut everybody up, and then they blew up the other helicopter full of them.
[00:12:11.483 --> 00:12:13.103]  And I talk to people and they go, really?
[00:12:13.103 --> 00:12:15.264]  I don't ever hear about the helicopters blowing up.
[00:12:15.264 --> 00:12:17.144]  I mean, they blow up helicopters full of them.
[00:12:17.144 --> 00:12:19.125]  They killed Pat Tillman to cover stuff up.
[00:12:19.125 --> 00:12:23.106]  They killed Private Lynch's, most of her team, because they said she was cowering in fear.
[00:12:24.286 --> 00:12:28.472]  And she had to go public or they were gonna kill her probably so they could come out and get women to join the military.
[00:12:28.472 --> 00:12:34.159]  It's all PR because you sit there and take the position of small children.
[00:12:34.159 --> 00:12:36.983]  Here's McClatchy newspaper, Washington Bureau.
[00:12:38.479 --> 00:12:43.443]  Al-Qaeda-linked group, Syria Rebels, once denied, now key to anti-Assad victories.
[00:12:43.443 --> 00:12:43.843]  What do you mean?
[00:12:43.843 --> 00:12:51.028]  For the 21 months of this, they admitted like 18 months ago, Al-Qaeda was the group they were shipping in and running the entire group.
[00:12:51.028 --> 00:12:53.030]  I mean, that's been admitted the entire time.
[00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:55.952]  The CFR three months ago said, of course we're running Al-Qaeda.
[00:12:55.952 --> 00:12:56.973]  Al-Qaeda's doing a great job.
[00:12:58.383 --> 00:13:02.627]  And literally, if you try to go anywhere now, cops come up and say you can't film.
[00:13:02.627 --> 00:13:10.473]  You can be on the side of a road, you can be... I had one of my photographers out last week taking photos.
[00:13:10.473 --> 00:13:13.856]  We said we need photos of a bunch of surveillance cameras for the magazine.
[00:13:13.856 --> 00:13:16.318]  So she's out taking stop photos for us.
[00:13:16.318 --> 00:13:17.539]  Great photographer.
[00:13:17.539 --> 00:13:21.623]  And they come over to a nicely dressed, clean-cut lady, and they say, you look shady.
[00:13:21.623 --> 00:13:24.405]  You're not allowed to take photos of the federal building.
[00:13:24.405 --> 00:13:25.266]  Get out of here.
[00:13:25.266 --> 00:13:26.387]  Bunch of guys around her.
[00:13:28.172 --> 00:13:33.994]  Meanwhile, it's like, come on man, you run Al-Qaeda, you run the drugs into the country.
[00:13:33.994 --> 00:13:36.996]  The feds even run child kidnapping ops.
[00:13:36.996 --> 00:13:38.897]  On record congressional testimony.
[00:13:38.897 --> 00:13:45.780]  Just leave me alone, you little idiot, you little nobody, posing like you're James Bond.
[00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.882]  The toilet attendants that work for the federal government think they're James Bond.
[00:13:49.462 --> 00:14:01.793]  And they festoon themselves in uniforms and outfits and little badges and little scan cards and they go to these big compartmentalized crime syndicates and all feel like they're official and all this baloney.
[00:14:01.793 --> 00:14:08.359]  Oh, you can't take photos or video in America because you might be a terrorist.
[00:14:08.359 --> 00:14:10.181]  Yes, a little blonde woman.
[00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:15.254]  Oh yes, you're so evil!
[00:14:15.254 --> 00:14:21.843]  I mean, what a grandstanding, drama-queening joke!
[00:14:21.843 --> 00:14:24.806]  You people blew up the World Trade Centers!
[00:14:24.806 --> 00:14:27.490]  You people shipping the narcotics on record!
[00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:28.872]  Just get off my back!
[00:14:32.426 --> 00:14:37.929]  And I know most people working for the federal government, you literally are just doing little menial jobs, but I mean, just give me a break.
[00:14:37.929 --> 00:14:41.211]  I mean, if you didn't get the memo, foreign banks already run this country.
[00:14:41.211 --> 00:14:46.753]  They're trying to mop up the alternative media because the mainstream media is imploding.
[00:14:46.753 --> 00:14:49.375]  Wait till I get to the top news.
[00:14:49.375 --> 00:14:56.138]  Al-Qaeda-linked group Syria Rebels once denied now key to Assad, anti-Assad victories.
[00:14:56.138 --> 00:14:57.179]  I mean, it was admitted
[00:14:58.357 --> 00:15:05.747]  Six months ago, they'd go in and tell a father, we're gonna kill your wife and children if you don't go suicide bomb.
[00:15:05.747 --> 00:15:14.538]  And they would have the news media, the New York Times, CNN, BBC, film it, and they'd put it on the news like these guys were heroes!
[00:15:15.489 --> 00:15:20.694]  And then the public would freak out and go, they're making people suicide bomb and they kill their families?
[00:15:20.694 --> 00:15:21.474]  That's horrible!
[00:15:21.474 --> 00:15:26.098]  Oh yeah, so we're going to pull that video now, or pull this video.
[00:15:26.098 --> 00:15:32.023]  They've got Christians chopping their heads off, throwing them off the tops of buildings, lining up people, shooting them.
[00:15:32.023 --> 00:15:37.288]  Al-Qaeda killed tens of thousands of black Libyans, flying Al-Qaeda flags, slaughtering 24-7 still.
[00:15:41.187 --> 00:15:44.669]  I go to the airport and somebody walks over and goes, oh, you're Alex Jones, you're a troublemaker.
[00:15:44.669 --> 00:15:45.249]  Where are you going?
[00:15:45.249 --> 00:15:45.969]  What are you doing?
[00:15:45.969 --> 00:15:46.710]  What are you planning?
[00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:48.330]  I'm behavioral assessing you.
[00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.792]  I'm deciding if I'm going to allow you to board this aircraft.
[00:15:50.792 --> 00:15:53.553]  And I'm just like, you really are a tyrant.
[00:15:53.553 --> 00:15:55.114]  This is total fantasy land.
[00:15:55.114 --> 00:15:58.235]  You don't like me because I don't live in fantasy island, man.
[00:15:58.235 --> 00:16:01.296]  I just can't take it anymore.
[00:16:01.296 --> 00:16:02.277]  It's such a joke.
[00:16:03.666 --> 00:16:09.692]  They're announcing nationwide under federal grants, even though the state legislature of my state has said it's illegal under the Constitution.
[00:16:09.692 --> 00:16:11.634]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[00:16:11.634 --> 00:16:17.140]  Checkpoints everywhere where they're going to search your car under the name of DWI checkpoints.
[00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.083]  All this country was built on whiskey, if you do your research.
[00:16:20.083 --> 00:16:21.605]  I'm not even saying that's a good thing.
[00:16:21.605 --> 00:16:23.827]  And they've got liquor stores and bars everywhere.
[00:16:24.608 --> 00:16:38.156]  And they wait till you get in your car when you've had one or two drinks and they CPS your kids and they take you away to raise revenue for their now admitted in court huge quotas everywhere.
[00:16:38.156 --> 00:16:40.357]  Hell, the cop taking you to jail is probably drunk.
[00:16:41.965 --> 00:16:53.358]  And it's so insane, and it's so illegal, and the feds are announcing nationwide that the local police who've been federalized are asking that all your text messages be saved for two years.
[00:16:53.358 --> 00:16:58.985]  That's like saying, we need to take your letter out when you mail it, make a copy of it for two years in case you do something wrong.
[00:16:58.985 --> 00:17:01.808]  It's called guilty until proven innocent.
[00:17:05.692 --> 00:17:10.415]  Oh, but everything the government does that's supposed to be public, it's all secret under national security.
[00:17:10.415 --> 00:17:11.476]  And, of course, it better be.
[00:17:11.476 --> 00:17:14.178]  Because you're wondering where your kid disappeared out of the backyard?
[00:17:14.178 --> 00:17:19.902]  Well, it was flown years ago to Europe to be raped and have your child's head blown off for snuff films.
[00:17:20.708 --> 00:17:22.149]  And you know, that even comes out in the news.
[00:17:22.149 --> 00:17:23.230]  It's back of the paper.
[00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:28.414]  Yeah, well, the government was involved, and yeah, DynCorp's involved, and it's no big deal, though.
[00:17:28.414 --> 00:17:33.638]  You know, we're gonna set up a checkpoint and search your car and dig through everything, because it's a free country.
[00:17:33.638 --> 00:17:39.902]  I tuned into Local Talk Radio this morning, and they were endorsing how great it is, that it'll save lives.
[00:17:39.902 --> 00:17:40.963]  Oh, yeah!
[00:17:40.963 --> 00:17:49.970]  That's why our life expectancy's dropping and our cancer rate's up almost 3,000 percent, because the government wants to save our lives, because the government's real nice people!
[00:17:51.811 --> 00:17:55.321]  Folks, in fact, let me just back that up since I just mentioned those things.
[00:17:55.321 --> 00:17:58.190]  CNET News at CBS.
[00:17:59.423 --> 00:18:01.784]  CBS Net News is what it stands for.
[00:18:01.784 --> 00:18:02.904]  Cops to Congress!
[00:18:02.904 --> 00:18:05.365]  We need logs of Americans' text messages.
[00:18:05.365 --> 00:18:08.327]  Yeah, no warrants, no nothing, and we just get everything.
[00:18:08.327 --> 00:18:11.448]  They're already doing it with their threat fusion centers.
[00:18:11.448 --> 00:18:13.209]  They can just flip a switch on the cop screen.
[00:18:13.209 --> 00:18:16.050]  Everything you're doing, turn on cameras in your cars.
[00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:19.151]  Oh, they're calling for that federally and in the state where I live?
[00:18:19.151 --> 00:18:22.492]  I got to hear clips of that on the news this morning, driving in and it all being endorsed.
[00:18:22.492 --> 00:18:26.054]  That breathalyzers on all cars, like France wants for everybody.
[00:18:26.601 --> 00:18:32.486]  First, it's, well, if you've ever been driving while intoxicated or even driving under the influence, you'll have a breathalyzer in your car.
[00:18:32.486 --> 00:18:36.510]  But now in Europe and areas, it's, oh, just everybody has one.
[00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:39.672]  Cops to Congress, we need logs of America's text messages.
[00:18:39.672 --> 00:18:47.639]  State and local law enforcement, that means federal goons, who go and say, oh, Satan, will you please enter my heart?
[00:18:47.639 --> 00:18:49.621]  When Satan's already runs them.
[00:18:49.621 --> 00:18:53.485]  They've already been taken over by the feds, and they're like, oh, we're inviting you in, vampire.
[00:18:55.046 --> 00:18:57.468]  Oh, the locals asked for us to come!
[00:18:57.468 --> 00:19:07.695]  State and local law enforcement groups, not peace officers, want wireless providers to store detailed information about your SMS messages for at least two years, in case they're needed for future criminal investigations.
[00:19:07.695 --> 00:19:09.456]  Yes, and we need cameras in your house.
[00:19:09.456 --> 00:19:16.361]  The Houston police chief four years ago said they want cameras in all of our houses, just in case something... Oh, by the way, they already do that in England now.
[00:19:16.361 --> 00:19:22.726]  For almost all new people that have kids, for six months there's a camera in there with the social workers watching you guilty until proven innocent.
[00:19:23.166 --> 00:19:28.372]  Texas police officials, not servants, want permanent DWI checkpoints.
[00:19:28.372 --> 00:19:30.274]  Oh yes, oh yes.
[00:19:30.274 --> 00:19:34.138]  Texas Deputy Police Chief wants DWI checkpoints.
[00:19:34.138 --> 00:19:35.860]  Yeah, Nazi Germany had them, why not?
[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:39.264]  I remember when they had a federal grant to do this before the legislature banned it.
[00:19:39.264 --> 00:19:43.349]  When they would shut down all of I-35, you'd have traffic for 30 miles back.
[00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:46.891]  With cops just pulling people out of cars, searching vehicles.
[00:19:46.891 --> 00:19:53.455]  Oh, and by the way, the TSA is announcing they'll be in all 50 states on all highways, searching your vehicle and groping you.
[00:19:53.455 --> 00:20:00.040]  That's in the news today, but when we come back, when we come back, if you're a gun owner, you're a member of the KKK.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:00.340]  That's the...
[00:20:01.803 --> 00:20:07.306]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[00:20:07.306 --> 00:20:10.487]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[00:20:10.487 --> 00:20:13.268]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[00:20:13.268 --> 00:20:16.210]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:19.171]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[00:20:19.671 --> 00:20:24.796]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[00:20:24.796 --> 00:20:27.418]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.
[00:20:27.418 --> 00:20:31.001]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.

[00:22:38.138 --> 00:22:38.939]  This capitalism?
[00:22:38.939 --> 00:22:45.203]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:22:45.203 --> 00:22:46.084]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:22:46.084 --> 00:22:49.326]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[00:23:11.223 --> 00:23:14.826]  A Big Berkey water filter gives them protection from bacteria, heavy metals,
[00:23:15.106 --> 00:23:18.868]  Chlorine, fluoride, pesticides and herbicides, VOCs and more.

[00:23:50.086 --> 00:23:51.666]  Give a Big Berkey Water Filter!
[00:24:04.332 --> 00:24:05.772]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[00:24:05.772 --> 00:24:11.634]  We have got masses of key news on so many subjects coming up.
[00:24:11.634 --> 00:24:17.056]  Lindsey Williams, always informative and thought-provoking, is joining us in the next hour.
[00:24:17.056 --> 00:24:28.059]  And then Max Keiser will also premiere a special report that I have produced with Aaron Dykes dealing with the all-out announcement and admissions.
[00:24:28.059 --> 00:24:29.559]  They've sounded the bugle.
[00:24:29.559 --> 00:24:32.620]  The establishment is coming to disarm us, and I'm going to break down why.
[00:24:33.942 --> 00:24:34.983]  But here's the deal.
[00:24:34.983 --> 00:24:43.551]  When Bob Costas went on Sunday Night Football and said, I agree with this columnist so let me just read off the teleprompter and quote him.
[00:24:44.497 --> 00:24:50.259]  That handguns are bad, you have no business having them, and that the gun culture is what the NFL has.
[00:24:50.259 --> 00:25:04.763]  That is a pure scapegoating, that is an attempt to blame the Second Amendment, law and order, Constitution, super low crime rates, on record areas that are constitutionalist.
[00:25:04.763 --> 00:25:06.084]  The media would call it conservative.
[00:25:07.163 --> 00:25:08.466]  It's just an absolute fact.
[00:25:08.466 --> 00:25:12.133]  You pass concealed carry, crime drops on average 25%.
[00:25:12.133 --> 00:25:13.175]  It's an absolute fact.
[00:25:13.175 --> 00:25:16.801]  The higher the gun ownership, the lower the crime rate, the more polite people are.
[00:25:17.543 --> 00:25:30.932]  But, you've got a gangster culture in rap and hip-hop, but also in a lot of the rock and roll now, that's, I'm gonna kill ya, I'm gonna shoot ya, and you've got people in these cities where they ban guns, killing each other at worldwide record numbers.
[00:25:30.932 --> 00:25:34.134]  Worldwide record numbers where they ban guns.
[00:25:34.134 --> 00:25:36.735]  Just like Mexico has some worldwide record numbers.
[00:25:36.735 --> 00:25:39.537]  Total gun ban for the citizens.
[00:25:39.537 --> 00:25:45.221]  So Costas comes out and he says, hey, it's the Second Amendment's fault.
[00:25:45.221 --> 00:25:46.342]  And, you know, they fired
[00:25:47.712 --> 00:25:49.274]  Uh, Hank Williams Jr.
[00:25:49.274 --> 00:25:51.836]  for saying our country is becoming a tyranny.
[00:25:51.836 --> 00:25:53.798]  They fired him for saying that on another show.
[00:25:53.798 --> 00:25:57.322]  Well this was said during the Star Spangled Banner.
[00:25:59.005 --> 00:26:06.448]  This was said during the beginning of the game, and there were other similar comments I've now learned because I wasn't watching it later in the game.
[00:26:06.448 --> 00:26:18.053]  I've gone back and found them on YouTube, where they were blaming the Second Amendment, not the drugs, not the corrupt culture, not the prescription drugs, not the concussions, not the gangbangers, spoiled rotten culture.
[00:26:18.053 --> 00:26:18.814]  That's like blaming...
[00:26:19.921 --> 00:26:26.003]  Dog owners for Michael Vick killing pit bulls and electrocuting them and torturing them and all this.
[00:26:26.003 --> 00:26:29.844]  Saying, well, we've got to ban dog ownership, which is what PETA, by the way, says.
[00:26:29.844 --> 00:26:31.865]  They say it's abusive to have animals, period.
[00:26:31.865 --> 00:26:35.266]  So let's just ban dog ownership because Michael Vick did something wrong.
[00:26:35.686 --> 00:26:38.027]  Hey, because one person drives drunk?
[00:26:38.027 --> 00:26:39.887]  Really drunk and inebriated?
[00:26:39.887 --> 00:26:41.008]  Drives recklessly?
[00:26:41.008 --> 00:26:42.748]  That's what you charge folks for.
[00:26:42.748 --> 00:26:44.369]  Back in the day, oh, you were recklessly driving.
[00:26:44.369 --> 00:26:45.769]  That's what you're charged for.
[00:26:45.769 --> 00:26:46.450]  I can see it.
[00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:47.430]  You were out of control.
[00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:48.250]  Boom.
[00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:49.691]  Serious jail time.
[00:26:49.691 --> 00:26:51.751]  Not, oh, you had two beers, you're going to jail.
[00:26:51.751 --> 00:26:53.552]  But again, this is everybody's guilty now.
[00:26:53.912 --> 00:27:04.777]  Oh, we're just going to set up a checkpoint on this highway or major road and we're going to search and breathalyzer all of you and have no refusal where we take blood if you say no when we stick a breathalyzer in your face.
[00:27:04.777 --> 00:27:08.399]  That's what all these federally funded no refusal weekends are.
[00:27:08.399 --> 00:27:10.880]  Now it's no refusal ever because we say so.
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.922]  Rubber stamp fake warrants.
[00:27:13.922 --> 00:27:17.223]  See, it's oh, somebody did something wrong with a gun.
[00:27:17.223 --> 00:27:18.744]  You're going to lose your gun now.
[00:27:20.862 --> 00:27:38.541]  And this Fox Sports columnist that Costas was quoting, Jason Whitlock, I then discovered yesterday afternoon that he was on a syndicated radio show and doing other interviews, there's multiple ones, and we're going to play the clip when we come back from break.
[00:27:38.541 --> 00:27:43.166]  Openly saying that if you own a gun, you are KKK and that you want
[00:27:44.173 --> 00:27:45.915]  Black people to kill each other.
[00:27:45.915 --> 00:27:50.239]  So it's not the fault of the gangster rap saying, kill, kill, kill, I'm so manly.
[00:27:50.239 --> 00:27:58.868]  It's not the fault of Chicago corrupt government banning guns or New York or other crime syndicates that have seized great American cities.
[00:27:58.868 --> 00:27:59.789]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:27:59.789 --> 00:28:02.371]  It's the fault of white people.
[00:28:02.371 --> 00:28:06.716]  He actually says this, white people are racist
[00:28:07.336 --> 00:28:11.398]  And are KKK, and the NRA is KKK.
[00:28:11.398 --> 00:28:34.330]  Folks, if the NRA doesn't sue this guy, and I'm not litigious, but man, when somebody gets up there and says you are KKK, white people are KKK, NRA is KKK, if you believe in gun ownership, not only is it pure slander defamation meant to hurt people on its face, the measure of boom, you are convicted.
[00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:37.555]  Of slander, of defamation, of libel.
[00:28:39.164 --> 00:28:48.272]  Ladies and gentlemen, it flies in the face 180 degrees, perfect lies, perfect fraud, perfect scam.
[00:28:48.272 --> 00:29:00.963]  Do you know on record, and AP Reuters have had to admit it, Daily Caller's got a great boil-down, basically copy from Jerusalem Preservation of Firearms Ownership, we've made films about this myself, it is on record.
[00:29:00.963 --> 00:29:06.427]  We've got another report coming out on this that I shot last night, we were up here, it was up here past midnight, we didn't get it out.
[00:29:07.389 --> 00:29:09.270]  We went and got the history of it.
[00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:19.112]  Do you know who in the southern states got the first gun control laws passed in 1867, 1889, and 1870?
[00:29:19.112 --> 00:29:23.734]  When more than 15 states passed laws against the Second Amendment, the first ever?
[00:29:23.734 --> 00:29:25.554]  Do you know who got it passed?
[00:29:25.554 --> 00:29:34.937]  The KKK literally lobbied, and even lobbied in Washington, and there's even photos from the time, and got gun laws passed.
[00:29:40.137 --> 00:29:48.809]  I mean, the KKK created gun control in this country, and this pig blames the Second Amendment!
[00:29:48.809 --> 00:29:49.750]  Ah!
[00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:51.152]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.152 --> 00:29:53.676]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.676 --> 00:29:56.359]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:00.476 --> 00:31:06.240]  Sodium fluoride in the body reduces IQ and increases cancers.
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:13.624]  Unfortunately, fluoride and its derivatives are only one of hundreds of toxins being added to our drinking water.
[00:31:13.624 --> 00:31:16.346]  We're battling the globalists on so many fronts.
[00:31:16.346 --> 00:31:22.410]  Health is an area where we can all take control of our lives and it all starts with that basic building block of water.
[00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:26.113]  It is time to purify our family's water.
[00:31:26.113 --> 00:31:33.000]  The ProPure filtration system with added fluoride filters is the best system for my research to protect you and your family.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.286]  Infowarsstore.com already has the lowest prices on ProPure water filtration.

[00:32:00.034 --> 00:32:03.097]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:32:03.097 --> 00:32:05.078]  Even save money on your electric bill?
[00:32:05.078 --> 00:32:08.702]  If so, this could be one of the most important messages you will ever hear.
[00:32:08.702 --> 00:32:10.903]  Solar power generators are now available.
[00:32:10.903 --> 00:32:14.547]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power.
[00:32:14.547 --> 00:32:20.632]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[00:32:20.632 --> 00:32:23.995]  It's like having an electrical power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:32:24.335 --> 00:32:29.079]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep your food from spoiling.
[00:32:29.079 --> 00:32:35.044]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:32:35.044 --> 00:32:36.345]  And here's the best news.
[00:32:36.345 --> 00:32:39.507]  A remarkable fall truckload sale is going on right now.
[00:32:39.507 --> 00:32:43.430]  It gets you $1,700 in bonuses when you buy a solar generator.
[00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:47.494]  To find out why these solar generators are the best generators, and get $1,700 in bonuses for doing so,

[00:32:51.236 --> 00:32:53.318]  That's falltruckloadsale.com.
[00:32:53.318 --> 00:32:55.519]  Generate your own supply of electricity.
[00:32:55.519 --> 00:32:57.561]  Go to falltruckloadsale.com.
[00:32:57.561 --> 00:33:03.165]  That's falltruckloadsale.com.
[00:33:03.165 --> 00:33:06.747]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:06.747 --> 00:33:16.454]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:16.454 --> 00:33:18.576]  Make no mistake, Bob Costas
[00:33:20.009 --> 00:33:26.859]  Of NBC, Jason Whitlock of Fox Sports, coming out and...
[00:33:28.453 --> 00:33:30.674]  Now I'm reading more of this guy's writings.
[00:33:30.674 --> 00:33:33.256]  He says gun ownership is racist.
[00:33:33.256 --> 00:33:37.018]  He says owning guns is evil.
[00:33:37.018 --> 00:33:40.940]  And he says that the NRA, the NRA is quote, the new KKK.
[00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:43.302]  And actually that report is now out.
[00:33:43.302 --> 00:33:46.624]  The video report at Infowars.com there in the featured news.
[00:33:46.624 --> 00:33:56.349]  It's my other report on Bob Costas coming out and saying, let me clarify my statement to USA Today.
[00:33:57.370 --> 00:34:16.457]  And he says in the report, and that video is going live right now where I break that down, he says in USA Today that you're too stupid to understand what he meant, and that he just thinks there should be reasonable restrictions on guns, and that means you can't have a handgun.
[00:34:16.457 --> 00:34:21.199]  He said he thinks it's fine if you're under the proper controls if you hunt.
[00:34:21.199 --> 00:34:23.240]  Let me read the quote here.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:25.241]  In favor of people owning guns to hunt,
[00:34:26.141 --> 00:34:31.307]  And carry them in a responsibly controlled circumstances like Chicago, New York with total gun bans.
[00:34:32.361 --> 00:34:33.622]  So, there you go.
[00:34:33.622 --> 00:34:36.304]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, the police can't and won't protect you.
[00:34:36.304 --> 00:34:45.230]  It's time you demand the right to keep and bear arms so that law-abiding citizens don't get thrown in jail when you take on the basic human right of defending yourself.
[00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:52.134]  Now, before I get to this clip, I want to explain something to Jason Whitlock of Fox Sports.
[00:34:52.134 --> 00:34:54.636]  Buddy, we are coming after you.
[00:34:54.636 --> 00:34:54.976]  Okay?
[00:34:54.976 --> 00:34:57.278]  The Second Amendment is my line in the sand.
[00:34:58.238 --> 00:35:02.360]  And I am calling for Fox Sports to fire you.
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.021]  You need to be fired.
[00:35:04.021 --> 00:35:08.803]  And if the NRA doesn't come after you, then I'm gonna have a problem with the NRA.
[00:35:08.803 --> 00:35:16.067]  Because they've just said the NRA and the quote gun culture are white supremacists who want to kill black people.
[00:35:16.067 --> 00:35:17.568]  I'm gonna play the clip.
[00:35:17.568 --> 00:35:18.288]  Okay?
[00:35:18.288 --> 00:35:19.949]  And I'm sick of it, okay?
[00:35:20.902 --> 00:35:24.904]  They, look, the globalists, the media, they use race as a weapon.
[00:35:24.904 --> 00:35:27.085]  Oh, you don't want government-run health care written by insurance companies?
[00:35:27.085 --> 00:35:27.946]  You're a racist.
[00:35:27.946 --> 00:35:28.886]  Oh, you don't want checkpoints?
[00:35:28.886 --> 00:35:30.107]  You're a racist.
[00:35:30.107 --> 00:35:33.029]  Oh, you caught bribery at the state capitol!
[00:35:33.029 --> 00:35:34.530]  With a white guy!
[00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:36.811]  They called up and said, are you a racist against black people?
[00:35:36.811 --> 00:35:37.371]  And I'm like, what?
[00:35:37.371 --> 00:35:39.012]  The Austin American Statesman.
[00:35:39.012 --> 00:35:40.513]  And I said, is this a real number?
[00:35:40.513 --> 00:35:42.094]  Are you really a statesman, Ryder?
[00:35:42.094 --> 00:35:42.874]  Let me call you back.
[00:35:42.874 --> 00:35:45.736]  I call back at the news desk, get the guy on the phone.
[00:35:45.736 --> 00:35:47.437]  This happened 12 years ago.
[00:35:47.437 --> 00:35:48.858]  He's like, do you believe I'm a reporter now?
[00:35:49.844 --> 00:35:52.985]  And I was like, yeah, why'd you ask me if I'm a racist?
[00:35:52.985 --> 00:35:54.485]  And the guy started laughing.
[00:35:54.485 --> 00:35:55.866]  They're cold-blooded folks.
[00:35:55.866 --> 00:35:58.247]  They use this as a weapons system.
[00:35:58.247 --> 00:36:01.548]  You give us your money, you give us your rights, or I'm gonna call you a racist.
[00:36:01.548 --> 00:36:03.908]  Well, good, call me one.
[00:36:03.908 --> 00:36:06.669]  They said, you've got to call their bluff on this, folks.
[00:36:06.669 --> 00:36:18.653]  The way they've set up the prisons and the prison culture, they put everybody in the prisons, the whites, the blacks, the Hispanics, the Asians, if it's on the east or west coast, in three to four different groups, where you've got to join a racist gang or you're dead.
[00:36:20.069 --> 00:36:22.930]  And the system wants this.
[00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:44.994]  The Democratic Party got caught being the Ku Klux Klan, and they got caught running all this, so they stole the big socialist experiment from Teddy Roosevelt, and government largesse, and outdid the Republican Party, because in their own words, as Margaret Sanger said, it's the only way we're going to be able to kill all the black people.
[00:36:44.994 --> 00:36:46.134]  And now they've got these
[00:36:47.199 --> 00:36:54.766]  These house organ propagandists that go out and Judas goat black folks, Hispanics, you name it.
[00:36:56.073 --> 00:36:59.035]  And you notice black folks can have groups that are race-based.
[00:36:59.035 --> 00:37:03.359]  You can have the Hispanic groups called La Raza, which means the race and all this stuff.
[00:37:03.359 --> 00:37:15.328]  Because that's because the system wants to get all that as a race-based system that government controls, while telling white people they're inherently evil, give the government and the foreign banks all your tax money or you're a racist.
[00:37:15.328 --> 00:37:17.290]  So we have to go after Bob Costas.
[00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:21.733]  Look, he came out with this insulting apology.
[00:37:21.733 --> 00:37:22.593]  It's not an apology.
[00:37:22.593 --> 00:37:25.055]  It's a clarification, USA Today said.
[00:37:25.055 --> 00:37:26.576]  And then they changed the headline overnight.
[00:37:26.576 --> 00:37:30.420]  In fact, I've got that back in Dew's office, the article before they changed the headline.
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:31.540]  Somebody will go find it.
[00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:33.522]  It's laying around somewhere in his office.
[00:37:33.522 --> 00:37:34.443]  It's somewhere around here.
[00:37:34.443 --> 00:37:37.225]  I was up here until like 9 at night.
[00:37:37.225 --> 00:37:41.889]  NBC's Bob Costas' take on criticism of his gun comments.
[00:37:41.889 --> 00:37:45.932]  It was, Bob Costas clarifies his statement.
[00:37:47.711 --> 00:37:54.834]  Now they've changed the headline again and it's his statement through his PR person that basically you're too stupid.
[00:37:54.834 --> 00:38:00.576]  He says he feels unfortunate leap was taken that he was advocating taking away the Second Amendment rights.
[00:38:00.576 --> 00:38:07.418]  No, he just plugged a column and said he totally agrees with it calling for banning handguns and said handguns are evil and you shouldn't have them.
[00:38:07.418 --> 00:38:11.500]  Exactly what the White House and Eric Holder and all of them are announcing.
[00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:14.521]  They're going to ban handguns, physical possession, make you turn them in,
[00:38:14.961 --> 00:38:15.682]  We're good to go.
[00:38:32.076 --> 00:38:32.556]  Who cares?
[00:38:32.556 --> 00:38:46.846]  I mean, you know, the president says he doesn't need law anymore for the UN to run the military, or for him to sign an executive order on cybersecurity and not let Congress see it, or shut down power plants, or signing statements, on and on and on.
[00:38:46.846 --> 00:38:55.632]  Obama says he'll have the most open presidency, most closed ever, says he won't sign executive orders, signs more than all presidents combined in four years.
[00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:00.123]  On and on and on and on.
[00:39:00.123 --> 00:39:01.965]  Says he's fighting the NDAA.
[00:39:01.965 --> 00:39:03.186]  Wrote the NDAA.
[00:39:03.186 --> 00:39:04.127]  Says he won't sign it.
[00:39:04.127 --> 00:39:04.767]  Signs it.
[00:39:04.767 --> 00:39:10.673]  But all these idiots sit there.
[00:39:10.673 --> 00:39:11.674]  Yeah, here's the USA Today.
[00:39:11.674 --> 00:39:14.036]  I guess there's been three different headlines.
[00:39:14.036 --> 00:39:14.336]  Look at this.
[00:39:14.336 --> 00:39:19.381]  Bob Costa's take on criticism on his gun comments.
[00:39:19.381 --> 00:39:20.242]  Find the original one.
[00:39:20.242 --> 00:39:21.022]  I can't.
[00:39:21.022 --> 00:39:22.343]  There's so many copies around here.
[00:39:22.343 --> 00:39:22.624]  I don't know.
[00:39:24.423 --> 00:39:26.064]  Okay, I'm going to play the clip.
[00:39:26.064 --> 00:39:28.906]  This just gets me so upset, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:28.906 --> 00:39:32.308]  I mean, this is violent race baiting.
[00:39:32.308 --> 00:39:32.748]  Violent.
[00:39:32.748 --> 00:39:38.351]  Listen, I got up here and I said DynCorp, that's the biggest private CPS contractor in the United States.
[00:39:38.351 --> 00:39:40.552]  That's another fact.
[00:39:40.552 --> 00:39:48.337]  What came out of congressional hearings was running kidnapping rings of women and children by the tens of thousands in Europe, and they didn't even get in trouble.
[00:39:48.337 --> 00:39:49.998]  And that was in the Chicago Tribune.
[00:39:49.998 --> 00:39:51.358]  It was in the BBC.
[00:39:51.358 --> 00:39:52.399]  We've made films about it.
[00:39:53.803 --> 00:39:58.466]  Now if that wasn't true, if you're a new listener and you just tune in and go, this is crazy.
[00:39:58.466 --> 00:39:59.967]  Yeah, reality is crazy.
[00:39:59.967 --> 00:40:01.948]  Stalin and Hitler and Mao were crazy.
[00:40:01.948 --> 00:40:03.269]  History is wild.
[00:40:03.269 --> 00:40:04.570]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:05.730]  I'm not the crazy one.
[00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:08.312]  I got my head screwed on straight and I'm freaked out about this.
[00:40:08.312 --> 00:40:11.394]  I want to motivate you to wake up so this nightmare doesn't get worse.
[00:40:13.393 --> 00:40:21.441]  I'm like somebody in one of those old movies where they're, you know, in the temple looking for the gold, and all of a sudden the water starts pouring in, or the sand starts pouring in, and the walls start closing.
[00:40:21.441 --> 00:40:24.083]  And I'm like, we gotta find the trap door, escape hatch, or we're dead.
[00:40:24.083 --> 00:40:26.725]  They're like, take it easy, it's not that bad.
[00:40:26.725 --> 00:40:28.547]  I'm like, no, no, we've seen this in history.
[00:40:28.547 --> 00:40:29.388]  This is dangerous.
[00:40:29.388 --> 00:40:30.509]  We need to revert.
[00:40:30.509 --> 00:40:32.311]  Oh, no, I like the rising water.
[00:40:32.311 --> 00:40:33.392]  It's like a hot tub.
[00:40:36.636 --> 00:40:44.725]  But just because you got a bunch of brain-damaged, mind-numbed, fluoride heads, Prozac heads out there, they don't count if they want to be mind-numbed.
[00:40:44.725 --> 00:40:47.068]  It's those of us that know what's going on.
[00:40:47.068 --> 00:40:52.934]  We're a larger minority, black, white, old, young, it doesn't matter, who love freedom and know what's going on.
[00:40:52.934 --> 00:40:55.838]  We are a giant minority compared to the tiny elite minority.
[00:40:56.636 --> 00:41:01.558]  So we need to stop freaking out if some of our neighbors laugh at us because they're so insecure.
[00:41:01.558 --> 00:41:03.820]  When they hear something scary, they just want to laugh at you.
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:06.141]  People say, Alex, you're trying to scare us.
[00:41:06.141 --> 00:41:07.321]  Those are cowards, folks.
[00:41:07.321 --> 00:41:08.842]  Cowards don't count.
[00:41:08.842 --> 00:41:11.523]  Because they're a coward, they think you're trying to scare them.
[00:41:11.523 --> 00:41:13.504]  People say, I get scared listening to your show.
[00:41:13.504 --> 00:41:14.965]  You get scared?
[00:41:14.965 --> 00:41:16.726]  All of that is already there.
[00:41:16.726 --> 00:41:19.948]  This evil is already happening.
[00:41:19.948 --> 00:41:23.329]  It's not going to go away denying it.
[00:41:23.329 --> 00:41:24.410]  And I'll use the analogy.
[00:41:26.234 --> 00:41:29.556]  Uh, of, you know, there's a burglar breaking in your house.
[00:41:29.556 --> 00:41:31.177]  And your wife's like, get up, Bob.
[00:41:31.177 --> 00:41:33.559]  You're like, you know, Marge, be quiet.
[00:41:33.559 --> 00:41:34.939]  You're scaring me.
[00:41:34.939 --> 00:41:38.501]  And you hear the guy breaking down the door.
[00:41:38.501 --> 00:41:40.262]  Marge, stop waking me up.
[00:41:40.262 --> 00:41:40.963]  You're scaring me.
[00:41:40.963 --> 00:41:41.703]  You're a fear monger.
[00:41:41.703 --> 00:41:43.484]  Well, Marge isn't a fear monger.
[00:41:43.484 --> 00:41:44.685]  She's saying, get up, Bob.
[00:41:44.685 --> 00:41:45.625]  Get up, Bill.
[00:41:45.625 --> 00:41:50.708]  Get the shotgun.
[00:41:50.708 --> 00:41:51.549]  Don't you understand that?
[00:41:52.836 --> 00:41:55.378]  I watched her banging in noises before and she's like, get a gun.
[00:41:55.378 --> 00:41:57.800]  I'm like, you get it, honey.
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:00.722]  What if I'm not here?
[00:42:00.722 --> 00:42:03.464]  She's a great shot, but you know, women need to think about that too.
[00:42:03.464 --> 00:42:12.511]  Because obviously I know if something's banging, you know, out in the woods or out in the country, you know, that it's just sound bouncing from the next little farm or something.
[00:42:12.511 --> 00:42:14.312]  You know, women are like, what is that?
[00:42:14.312 --> 00:42:15.453]  Oh my gosh, do something.
[00:42:15.453 --> 00:42:18.356]  The dogs are barking and I'm like, get the shotgun.
[00:42:18.356 --> 00:42:20.117]  I'm like, honey, you get it.
[00:42:20.117 --> 00:42:20.958]  This is a good drill.
[00:42:21.954 --> 00:42:24.016]  That sounds like a backhoe digging at night.
[00:42:24.016 --> 00:42:25.798]  Oh, that is what it is.
[00:42:25.798 --> 00:42:29.001]  But it's so simple.
[00:42:29.001 --> 00:42:31.203]  I'm not telling you all this because I live in fear.
[00:42:31.203 --> 00:42:37.930]  Folks, I'm willing for them to kill me, which they might do, to be able to get this out to warn you so these people don't win.
[00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:42.194]  Not because I'm a hero, but because I want my children to grow up in a free country.
[00:42:42.194 --> 00:42:43.456]  I had a fundamental
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:45.841]  Gut level.
[00:42:45.841 --> 00:42:47.181]  Genetic level.
[00:42:47.181 --> 00:42:49.703]  Just like a dog growls at a bad man.
[00:42:49.703 --> 00:43:01.210]  I am got my hackles up, snarling, and I'm snapping at the New World Order trying to hit its Achilles heel.
[00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:05.713]  And it's so fundamental.
[00:43:05.713 --> 00:43:07.454]  I'm trying to get you moving.
[00:43:07.454 --> 00:43:09.255]  Hey, they're knocking down the door.
[00:43:09.255 --> 00:43:14.018]  They're coming in.
[00:43:14.018 --> 00:43:14.478]  Get ready.
[00:43:16.331 --> 00:43:22.297]  I'll use a Lord of the Rings analogy because I just watched that after probably five, six years of not seeing it.
[00:43:22.297 --> 00:43:27.281]  My son's old enough now, ten, I think, to see it because it's got some good archetypal information in it.
[00:43:27.281 --> 00:43:29.063]  I think overall a healthy story.
[00:43:33.902 --> 00:43:38.547]  You know, there's the scene where they're down there in the mines of Moria that's been taken over by the orcs 50 years before.
[00:43:38.547 --> 00:43:39.868]  Everybody's dead.
[00:43:39.868 --> 00:43:44.933]  And they drop a bucket down a mineshaft and all of a sudden they hear the drums.
[00:43:44.933 --> 00:43:46.695]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:43:46.695 --> 00:43:52.020]  And they're reading the annals of the last fight there in the throne room about drums, drums, drums in the deep.
[00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:52.741]  They are coming.
[00:43:52.741 --> 00:43:53.502]  They are at the door.
[00:43:54.650 --> 00:44:00.111]  I mean, did they say, stop it, Gandalf, don't tell us the orcs are coming, you're a fear monger.
[00:44:00.111 --> 00:44:01.551]  No, it's like, get ready!
[00:44:01.551 --> 00:44:02.752]  They're coming through the door!
[00:44:02.752 --> 00:44:12.274]  I mean, did people come to their windows and say, stop it, Paul Revere, how dare you say an invasion force is landing?
[00:44:12.274 --> 00:44:15.034]  How dare you say they're coming to take our guns?
[00:44:15.034 --> 00:44:16.835]  How dare you?
[00:44:16.835 --> 00:44:18.355]  It already happened in other areas of the country.
[00:44:24.008 --> 00:44:26.131]  Do people come out and say, how dare you?
[00:44:26.131 --> 00:44:27.312]  I think you're a traitor.
[00:44:27.312 --> 00:44:29.875]  I think you're working for the Redcoats, Paul Revere.
[00:44:29.875 --> 00:44:30.977]  Telling us they're coming.
[00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:36.401]  Oneth by land, toeth by sea.
[00:44:36.401 --> 00:44:37.321]  They're coming!
[00:44:37.321 --> 00:44:37.901]  They're coming!
[00:44:37.901 --> 00:44:39.901]  Drums, drums, drums in the deep!
[00:44:39.901 --> 00:44:41.222]  Is it drums in the deep?
[00:44:41.222 --> 00:44:43.942]  They're doing every tyrannical thing you can imagine.
[00:44:43.942 --> 00:44:46.883]  Parading up and down in front of us.
[00:44:46.883 --> 00:44:49.164]  Getting the police and the military ready.
[00:44:49.164 --> 00:44:50.804]  Demonizing the founding fathers.
[00:44:50.804 --> 00:44:52.524]  Demonizing private property.
[00:44:52.524 --> 00:44:54.045]  Demonizing homeschool.
[00:44:54.045 --> 00:44:57.926]  I mean, just exactly what you would expect in a Red Dawn scenario.
[00:44:57.926 --> 00:44:59.786]  What would be taught in a re-education camp.
[00:45:01.007 --> 00:45:06.630]  And I've got the training videos, I've put them out publicly, where the police are sitting around when they're demonizing George Washington.
[00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:07.470]  FEMA is.
[00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:11.572]  To firefighters, police, and sheriff's deputies, and the cops, they go, who are the terrorists?
[00:45:11.572 --> 00:45:13.513]  George Washington, good job!
[00:45:13.513 --> 00:45:15.654]  You see the police nodding their heads.
[00:45:15.654 --> 00:45:17.615]  You see a few kind of shifting in their chairs.
[00:45:17.615 --> 00:45:19.416]  And the FEMA guy's watching.
[00:45:19.416 --> 00:45:22.158]  You're all being assessed in there.
[00:45:22.158 --> 00:45:25.619]  If you watch the body language, they're assessing who does it.
[00:45:25.619 --> 00:45:26.560]  Tell us what you thought of this.
[00:45:27.739 --> 00:45:29.840]  That's what you thought of this little meeting we just had.
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:38.743]  I mean, these are enemy operatives who've seized our federal government and seized most our states, parading around everywhere.
[00:45:38.743 --> 00:45:46.366]  And now they've got Fox sportscasters giving talking points to NBC and the NFL, and that stuff is pre-approved by the NFL.
[00:45:46.366 --> 00:45:47.486]  I looked it up.
[00:45:47.486 --> 00:45:49.267]  Not that I needed to.
[00:45:49.267 --> 00:45:54.589]  For Bob Costas to read off a teleprompter and say handguns are bad and they're what's to blame here.
[00:45:56.325 --> 00:46:03.968]  And now you are the KKK if you believe in the Second Amendment when it is on record.
[00:46:03.968 --> 00:46:13.793]  And we have the news articles in the video up at InfoWars.com right now documenting the entire history of this.
[00:46:13.793 --> 00:46:19.015]  Anti-gun sports columnist Jason Whitlock, the NRA is the new KKK.
[00:46:19.015 --> 00:46:22.897]  I guess we inadvertently borrowed the headline from the Daily Caller that actually
[00:46:24.017 --> 00:46:26.098]  Well, they didn't break it, but they got the story out yesterday on that.
[00:46:26.098 --> 00:46:26.838]  That's where we saw it.
[00:46:26.838 --> 00:46:29.619]  And then I guess when I shot the video, that's the headline we used.
[00:46:29.619 --> 00:46:30.840]  But there it is.
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:34.561]  That's a video right there where I show all the documents, all the articles, all the history.
[00:46:34.561 --> 00:46:35.881]  It is on record.
[00:46:35.881 --> 00:46:43.824]  The Ku Klux Klan was the lobbying arm that got gun control passed in this country.
[00:46:43.824 --> 00:46:49.146]  And, you know, I'll tell people that say, oh, let's take this group's rights or that group's rights because they're poor, they're whatever.
[00:46:49.146 --> 00:46:50.567]  Folks, it will be used on everybody.
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:59.003]  Just from a pragmatic position out there, just like Tony Brown says, whatever is done to the black community is done in your community.
[00:46:59.003 --> 00:47:05.345]  So even if you are a tribalist, a racist, whatever, understand whatever is done to any group will come back on you.
[00:47:05.345 --> 00:47:07.906]  That's the way the universe works.
[00:47:07.906 --> 00:47:10.748]  But let's go ahead and play this clip.
[00:47:10.748 --> 00:47:15.789]  Anti-gun sports columnist Jason Whitlock, the NRA is the new KKK.
[00:47:15.789 --> 00:47:16.770]  That would be like
[00:47:18.723 --> 00:47:25.046]  That is, that is equivalent to saying Rosa Parks was a grand dragon in the Ku Klux Klan.
[00:47:25.046 --> 00:47:32.849]  It is that, it is, no, no, it's like saying Martin Luther King was a grand dragon.
[00:47:32.849 --> 00:47:35.410]  I mean, it is that over the top.
[00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:40.812]  And this is all scripted, ladies and gentlemen, because this is what the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center say.
[00:47:40.812 --> 00:47:43.673]  More anti-American groups that are funded by foreign banks on record.
[00:47:44.462 --> 00:47:45.923]  I mean, this is a takeover!
[00:47:45.923 --> 00:47:46.904]  Hey, I like freedom!
[00:47:46.904 --> 00:47:47.865]  Shut up, racist!
[00:47:47.865 --> 00:47:51.488]  Hey, I don't want government health care and the government having death panels and running what care I can get.
[00:47:51.488 --> 00:47:53.010]  I really didn't think it worked too well in Europe.
[00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:53.731]  Shut up, racist!
[00:47:53.731 --> 00:47:57.594]  I mean, it's ridiculous!
[00:47:57.594 --> 00:47:58.855]  And they sit there like it's a weapon.
[00:47:58.855 --> 00:48:02.338]  They smile when they say it, like you're supposed to go, oh man, you really got me right there.
[00:48:02.338 --> 00:48:03.319]  You're right, I'm bad.
[00:48:03.319 --> 00:48:06.162]  Take my guns, take my guns.
[00:48:06.162 --> 00:48:10.005]  So here is the guy that gives us talking points to Bob Cozzas that we must boycott.
[00:48:10.816 --> 00:48:15.322]  Here he is, Jason Whitlock, and Fox News better reprimand this guy.
[00:48:15.322 --> 00:48:16.143]  But you know what?
[00:48:16.143 --> 00:48:18.105]  Constitutionalists have been trained to roll over.
[00:48:18.105 --> 00:48:21.649]  The NRA will probably say, don't call us racist, we promise we're not.
[00:48:21.649 --> 00:48:24.493]  They probably won't even say the Ku Klux Klan got the first gunman's past.
[00:48:27.625 --> 00:48:29.025]  It's all okay, yeah.
[00:48:29.025 --> 00:48:30.606]  Oh, actually we are racist.
[00:48:30.606 --> 00:48:31.746]  Thank you for calling us that.
[00:48:31.746 --> 00:48:34.066]  I mean, it is ridiculous.
[00:48:34.066 --> 00:48:38.807]  Here is just part of the disgusting transaction on the Assinike Radio Show where he was speaking.
[00:48:38.807 --> 00:48:39.067]  Here it is.
[00:48:39.067 --> 00:48:50.730]  You know, I did not go as far as I would like to go because my thoughts on the NRA and America's gun culture, I believe the NRA is the new KKK.
[00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:51.390]  Wow.
[00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:56.231]  And that the arming of so many black youth and
[00:48:57.142 --> 00:48:57.742]  We're good to go.
[00:49:27.546 --> 00:49:31.808]  Some kids listening to music into a murder scene.
[00:49:31.808 --> 00:49:36.469]  And, uh, you know, if you don't have a gun, you drive home.
[00:49:36.469 --> 00:49:38.190]  You know, kids are listening to some loud music.
[00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:39.010]  You don't like it?
[00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:39.910]  Ah, that annoys me.
[00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:41.851]  You go home and complain to your wife.
[00:49:41.851 --> 00:49:45.172]  When you have a gun, you open fire, potentially.
[00:49:45.172 --> 00:49:45.973]  Ah, that's enough.
[00:49:45.973 --> 00:49:48.453]  The full clip is up at InfoWars.com.
[00:49:50.769 --> 00:49:52.229]  And it is just asinine.
[00:49:52.229 --> 00:49:56.290]  I mean, obviously, the places with these high crime rates is where they disarm the general public.
[00:49:56.290 --> 00:50:02.232]  It's total gangster rap where they glorify killing each other across the board.
[00:50:02.232 --> 00:50:03.432]  And then people get killed.
[00:50:03.432 --> 00:50:05.693]  And it's not the gangster rap fault.
[00:50:05.693 --> 00:50:08.593]  It's not that culture's fault being sold by MTV.
[00:50:08.593 --> 00:50:13.914]  It's not the fault of the, quote, liberal media pushing and saying how great all this is.
[00:50:13.914 --> 00:50:14.835]  It's not the fault.
[00:50:14.835 --> 00:50:15.815]  No, no, it's the fault
[00:50:16.315 --> 00:50:23.862]  Of the NRA, who's the new KKK, who defends the Second Amendment so black people kill themselves.
[00:50:23.862 --> 00:50:26.264]  Unbelievable.
[00:50:26.264 --> 00:50:29.427]  Now there is a tiny grain of truth in there.
[00:50:29.427 --> 00:50:32.510]  You notice he talked about the drugs so the communities destroy themselves.
[00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:36.033]  Yeah, they bring in the drugs so all of us become enslaved.
[00:50:36.033 --> 00:50:41.558]  But it's unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen, that this is what they're now going to push.
[00:50:42.734 --> 00:50:44.155]  Incredible.
[00:50:44.155 --> 00:50:54.781]  Incredible that our society is degenerating and breaking down and the only thing frustrating crime is the Second Amendment and the statistics all prove that.
[00:50:54.781 --> 00:50:58.544]  Unbelievable demonization and race baiting.
[00:50:58.544 --> 00:50:59.364]  Disgusting.
[00:50:59.364 --> 00:51:00.725]  He needs to get in trouble for it.
[00:51:01.085 --> 00:51:06.870]  Sodium fluoride in the body reduces IQ and increases cancers.
[00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:14.235]  Unfortunately, fluoride and its derivatives are only one of hundreds of toxins being added to our drinking water.
[00:51:14.235 --> 00:51:16.977]  We're battling the globalist on so many fronts.
[00:51:16.977 --> 00:51:23.022]  Health is an area where we can all take control of our lives, and it all starts with that basic building block of water.
[00:51:23.682 --> 00:51:26.724]  It is time to purify our family's water.
[00:51:26.724 --> 00:51:33.608]  The ProPure filtration system with added fluoride filters is the best system for my research to protect you and your family.
[00:51:33.608 --> 00:51:38.671]  Infowarstore.com already has the lowest prices on ProPure water filtration.
[00:51:38.891 --> 00:51:44.957]  But until December 10th, we are going to offer 15% off the already lowest price.
[00:51:44.957 --> 00:51:47.280]  I know what I'm giving my family this Christmas.
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:48.001]  ProPure.
[00:51:48.001 --> 00:51:54.007]  Go to InfowarsStore.com and get 15% off the already lowest price out there with the code WATER15.
[00:51:54.007 --> 00:51:56.309]  WATER15 and you get 15% off at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:52:00.666 --> 00:52:02.429]  Lunch is ready!
[00:52:02.429 --> 00:52:06.053]  And it's an MRE smorgasbord at longlifefood.com.
[00:52:06.053 --> 00:52:13.263]  In 1983, Long Life Food Depot was one of the first to sell MRE pouches to the public, and we're still selling them almost 30 years later.
[00:52:13.263 --> 00:52:17.189]  Today, Long Life Food Depot has the world's most complete MRE online buffet.
[00:52:17.389 --> 00:52:19.310]  Because MREs are all we do.
[00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:22.891]  Tasty varieties of chicken, beef, salmon, and pasta entrees.
[00:52:22.891 --> 00:52:25.612]  Plus sandwiches and our easy-to-use pouches.
[00:52:25.612 --> 00:52:28.933]  Full moisture, long shelf life, and ready to eat hot or cold.
[00:52:28.933 --> 00:52:32.234]  We sell by the pouch or case, so the choices are endless.
[00:52:32.234 --> 00:52:34.575]  And so are the graduated quantity discounts.
[00:52:34.575 --> 00:52:36.696]  The more you buy, the more you save.
[00:52:36.696 --> 00:52:45.158]  Call 800-601-2833 or go to longlifefood.com to join our email list for upcoming announcements, like the Rollaway Food Pod.
[00:52:45.158 --> 00:52:46.959]  Plus enjoy fast and free shipping.
[00:52:47.119 --> 00:52:51.781]  Just call 800-601-2833 or visit longlifefood.com.
[00:52:51.781 --> 00:52:53.021]  Emergency preparedness.
[00:52:53.021 --> 00:52:54.122]  Emergency relief.
[00:52:54.122 --> 00:52:55.442]  Longlifefood.com.
[00:52:55.442 --> 00:52:56.723]  Since 1983.
[00:52:56.723 --> 00:53:00.204]  Sending real food to your real future.
[00:53:00.204 --> 00:53:02.805]  So it's off to Grandma's house for the holidays, eh?
[00:53:02.805 --> 00:53:04.366]  That's great!
[00:53:04.366 --> 00:53:11.469]  But while you're going over the river and through the woods, professional burglars are choosing easy targets to break into.
[00:53:11.469 --> 00:53:13.349]  Don't be an easy target.
[00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:14.810]  Plug in fake TV.
[00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:19.453]  Fool criminals into believing someone's home at your house watching TV.
[00:53:19.453 --> 00:53:24.838]  Fake TV works a bit like a light on a timer, but fake TV is far more convincing.
[00:53:24.838 --> 00:53:30.042]  Fake TV plugs into any outlet and simulates the light and colors of a real TV.
[00:53:30.042 --> 00:53:34.425]  Burglars will likely move on to easier targets and leave your house alone.
[00:53:34.425 --> 00:53:39.770]  Fake TV costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plans and makes a great Christmas gift.
[00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:42.652]  Or it's perfect if you're traveling over the holidays or any time.
[00:53:43.032 --> 00:53:49.478]  Order your fake TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to FAKETV.com.
[00:53:49.478 --> 00:53:55.343]  That's 877-532-5388 or FAKETV.com.
[00:53:55.343 --> 00:54:01.009]  FAKETV, the burglar deterrent.
[00:54:01.009 --> 00:54:03.791]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:54:03.791 --> 00:54:06.594]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:21.342]  Let me analyze what's happening with the gangster culture.
[00:54:21.342 --> 00:54:27.545]  Men are designed, when they hit about 12, 13, 14, to want to become warriors.
[00:54:27.545 --> 00:54:34.429]  Because any culture that didn't have strong young men that were ready to fight got overrun, enslaved, and exterminated.
[00:54:34.429 --> 00:54:36.510]  So humans across the board are ready to fight.
[00:54:37.546 --> 00:54:44.508]  In fact, they get us kind of an artificial cowardice by young people never actually having conflict.
[00:54:44.508 --> 00:55:00.854]  It's actually important that young people get in controlled things like boxing and good old-fashioned schoolyard brawls because it teaches you by increments when you're 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, pretty soon you start getting hurt real bad.
[00:55:00.854 --> 00:55:04.395]  You learn how to not get in fights unless you absolutely have to.
[00:55:06.007 --> 00:55:08.788]  But then you also have confidence and you're not a coward.
[00:55:08.788 --> 00:55:11.730]  With real power comes control.
[00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:20.273]  Instead you've got arrested development people that don't even really know how to fight and so they listen to stuff all day that's about how I killed this guy, I killed that guy.
[00:55:20.273 --> 00:55:22.374]  They think that's what a man does.
[00:55:22.374 --> 00:55:24.735]  They get a gun, they go out and kill somebody.
[00:55:24.735 --> 00:55:27.296]  Or they go to rob houses because that's what's cool.
[00:55:27.296 --> 00:55:30.478]  You know, young white girls, it's a big fun thing.
[00:55:30.478 --> 00:55:32.839]  Black kids, Hispanics, you name it, it's gangster culture.
[00:55:33.706 --> 00:55:40.891]  And people get shot all the time and now they're trying to indict homeowners when one guy shot this teenage girl robbing his house and she laughed at him.
[00:55:40.891 --> 00:55:42.592]  That's how delusional they are.
[00:55:42.592 --> 00:55:43.533]  So he shot her again.
[00:55:43.533 --> 00:55:45.934]  And then he admitted that to the cops.
[00:55:45.934 --> 00:55:47.155]  They go, well, we're going to arrest you then.
[00:55:47.155 --> 00:55:49.297]  You shouldn't have shot this girl robbing you.
[00:55:49.297 --> 00:55:53.840]  The point is, is that there's a real world out there.
[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:53.980]  And
[00:55:55.885 --> 00:56:00.788]  Even if you have to defend yourself, it's a very serious situation.
[00:56:00.788 --> 00:56:03.430]  Not just out looking for trouble all day.
[00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:07.272]  But that's what the punk culture does.
[00:56:07.272 --> 00:56:12.796]  And nine times out of ten, punks start something and then once you're ready to deliver, then they back off.
[00:56:12.796 --> 00:56:15.177]  They want the symbol of the power.
[00:56:15.177 --> 00:56:19.480]  But I read all the time about people being beaten to death in these brawls.
[00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:20.741]  It's not just guns doing it.
[00:56:21.974 --> 00:56:27.761]  And it's because society's degenerating, we need more guns.
[00:56:27.761 --> 00:56:34.889]  And the gun culture is really starting to spread, and that's why they want to brand it as the gangster culture.
[00:56:34.889 --> 00:56:36.050]  No.
[00:56:36.050 --> 00:56:38.132]  The gun culture is Americana.
[00:56:38.132 --> 00:56:39.254]  Rugged individualism.
[00:56:39.254 --> 00:56:40.095]  Take care of yourself.
[00:56:41.462 --> 00:56:45.445]  Don't point a gun at somebody unless you're getting ready to use it to defend yourself.
[00:56:45.445 --> 00:56:47.227]  Don't use a gun offensively.
[00:56:47.227 --> 00:56:48.348]  Use it defensively.
[00:56:48.348 --> 00:56:49.128]  Hey!
[00:56:49.128 --> 00:56:52.151]  Guns, I'm absolutely programmed from training since age four.
[00:56:53.499 --> 00:56:55.901]  I don't aim something at you unless I'm going to pull the trigger.
[00:56:55.901 --> 00:57:02.886]  I don't aim something at you unless you're invading my house and threatening me.
[00:57:02.886 --> 00:57:14.796]  By the way, I think I can take care of myself in most fights, but if I happen to be around a firearm and you attack me for no reason, I'm just going to go ahead, because you could kill me, I'm just going to go ahead and defend myself with lethal force.
[00:57:16.513 --> 00:57:17.433]  I mean, it's that simple.
[00:57:17.433 --> 00:57:20.034]  I'm not playing games with people.
[00:57:20.034 --> 00:57:20.274]  Okay?
[00:57:20.274 --> 00:57:24.195]  And I'm not looking to kill somebody to feel manly and big either.
[00:57:24.195 --> 00:57:24.855]  You understand that?
[00:57:24.855 --> 00:57:26.756]  But I'm looking to live here.
[00:57:26.756 --> 00:57:31.897]  You see, I'm a real nice, sweet guy that rocks my little babies to sleep at night.
[00:57:31.897 --> 00:57:37.059]  That's because I have love that I'm ready to kill to protect my family.
[00:57:37.059 --> 00:57:37.679]  You understand that?
[00:57:37.679 --> 00:57:39.219]  It's not because I'm a tough guy.
[00:57:39.219 --> 00:57:41.180]  It's because I've got a life force.
[00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:42.080]  I'm here to live.
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:42.920]  I'm here to thrive.
[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:43.980]  I'm here to build.
[00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:45.461]  I'm here to uplift humanity.
[00:57:46.161 --> 00:57:52.546]  And we've been taught that civilization means you're a, I don't want to say effeminate, because it's an insult to women.
[00:57:52.546 --> 00:57:55.588]  You are domesticated, weak, limp-wristed men and women.
[00:57:55.588 --> 00:58:02.914]  And people are discovering empowerment, they are discovering how good it is, and liberty is being reborn.
[00:58:04.005 --> 00:58:06.926]  That's why they banned dodgeball and then jogging and wrestling.
[00:58:06.926 --> 00:58:09.328]  That's why they're trying to ban competitive sports now.
[00:58:09.328 --> 00:58:11.089]  They're trying to ban boxing.
[00:58:11.089 --> 00:58:15.050]  They're trying to ban mixed martial arts.
[00:58:15.050 --> 00:58:16.751]  You know, there's big calls for that.
[00:58:16.751 --> 00:58:19.333]  With the same crowd that runs Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
[00:58:19.333 --> 00:58:25.015]  They want us domesticated where the elites have specialized killers and we all just sit here and take it.
[00:58:25.015 --> 00:58:26.016]  No!
[00:58:26.016 --> 00:58:31.579]  If you want freedom, if you want love, you better get ready to defend it physically.
[00:58:32.526 --> 00:58:35.907]  Because a nation of sheep will be ruled by wolves!
[00:58:35.907 --> 00:58:43.130]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com!

[00:59:55.851 --> 01:00:05.256]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.256 --> 01:00:06.577]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.577 --> 01:00:08.338]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.338 --> 01:00:10.099]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.099 --> 01:00:11.680]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:13.220]  Well, so does he.

[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:35.363]  He says he's got new breaking information, hasn't been on the radio in about a month.
[01:00:35.363 --> 01:00:35.923]  Period.
[01:00:35.923 --> 01:00:36.483]  He's joining us.
[01:00:36.483 --> 01:00:38.325]  Max Keiser coming up.
[01:00:38.325 --> 01:00:40.526]  I'm gonna intersperse a ton of news.
[01:00:40.526 --> 01:00:44.670]  TSA seeks permission to conduct security assessments on highways.
[01:00:45.330 --> 01:00:46.191]  That's checkpoints.
[01:00:46.191 --> 01:00:47.011]  They're already doing it.
[01:00:47.011 --> 01:00:49.093]  Now they're going into all 50 states.
[01:00:49.093 --> 01:00:55.718]  TSA is creating and maintaining a watch list of Americans who violate its policies, and then they're going to try to stop you from flying.
[01:00:55.718 --> 01:00:58.520]  That's what every authoritarian system sets up.
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:00.882]  Before they start arresting people en masse.
[01:01:00.882 --> 01:01:01.963]  Rounding you up.
[01:01:01.963 --> 01:01:02.444]  Breaking.
[01:01:02.444 --> 01:01:05.866]  Does new photo prove Trayvon Martin killing with self-defense?
[01:01:05.866 --> 01:01:07.387]  Yeah, they had robberies in the area.
[01:01:07.387 --> 01:01:08.428]  Zimmerman was following.
[01:01:10.772 --> 01:01:13.176]  He got assaulted, shot him.
[01:01:13.176 --> 01:01:14.818]  Was it smart to follow him?
[01:01:14.818 --> 01:01:16.261]  Probably not.
[01:01:16.261 --> 01:01:20.769]  But did the Justice Department seize on it to create racial division and to go after the Second Amendment?
[01:01:20.769 --> 01:01:21.009]  Yes.
[01:01:22.369 --> 01:01:23.790]  That's the talking point.
[01:01:23.790 --> 01:01:25.732]  Guns are racist.
[01:01:25.732 --> 01:01:28.954]  Continuing, guns that are like spoons make people fat.
[01:01:28.954 --> 01:01:30.375]  I know I beat that to death, but it's true.
[01:01:30.375 --> 01:01:33.558]  So we're going to be getting into some of that.
[01:01:33.558 --> 01:01:40.223]  Queen's dad pushed to his death by madman in Times Square subway station, pushed in front of an oncoming train.
[01:01:40.223 --> 01:01:43.506]  Well, the answer is banned hands, because somebody might push somebody.
[01:01:43.506 --> 01:01:45.788]  I mean, that's obvious.
[01:01:45.788 --> 01:01:50.411]  A guy killed some of his family with a bow and arrow, USA Today reported.
[01:01:51.334 --> 01:02:01.724]  Man killed father in Wyoming bow and arrow attack in front of a computer science class not long after fatally stabbing his father live.
[01:02:01.724 --> 01:02:04.928]  His father's live-in girlfriend at their home a couple of miles away.
[01:02:04.928 --> 01:02:06.129]  Well, it's an obvious answer.
[01:02:06.129 --> 01:02:09.532]  Ban knives and ban bows and ban arrows.
[01:02:09.532 --> 01:02:10.934]  Ban spoons, ban hands.
[01:02:10.934 --> 01:02:12.375]  I mean, this is pretty obvious.
[01:02:12.375 --> 01:02:14.637]  Fox Sports, Bob Costas, NBC.
[01:02:14.637 --> 01:02:14.998]  Ban it!
[01:02:15.776 --> 01:02:22.197]  In fact, if you guys punch up InfoWars.com, there's a new Don Salazar, Alex Jones article.
[01:02:22.197 --> 01:02:25.238]  Alex Jones calls for boycott of NFL, NBC, and Bob Costas.
[01:02:25.238 --> 01:02:30.759]  And I kind of recorded a transcript and he wrote an article on it of why I'm saying we need to boycott.
[01:02:30.759 --> 01:02:36.500]  I'm going to have a Don also add my new video reports that are up on YouTube.
[01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:38.780]  They're also up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:41.341]  There's a whole plethora.
[01:02:43.493 --> 01:02:45.514]  of them up there.
[01:02:45.514 --> 01:02:46.414]  Here are some of them.
[01:02:46.414 --> 01:02:49.416]  Fox Sports writer, the NRA is the new KKK.
[01:02:49.416 --> 01:02:50.916]  Banned guns.
[01:02:50.916 --> 01:02:52.877]  The NFL is helping Obama.
[01:02:52.877 --> 01:02:53.638]  Banned guns.
[01:02:53.638 --> 01:02:55.779]  Boycott now.
[01:02:55.779 --> 01:02:57.960]  Everybody said, why are you putting a tie on yesterday?
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:02.041]  And I said, well, this is the bugle sound to attack the Second Amendment.
[01:03:02.041 --> 01:03:02.942]  They're coming.
[01:03:02.942 --> 01:03:03.582]  They're coming.
[01:03:03.582 --> 01:03:05.023]  Drums, drums, drums in the deep.
[01:03:06.127 --> 01:03:08.150]  Get ready, they're at the door.
[01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:12.476]  I mean, I gotta put a tie on, man, for all four battle formations.
[01:03:12.476 --> 01:03:15.501]  I mean, I think I'm gonna start wearing a suit and tie every day, I'm serious.
[01:03:15.501 --> 01:03:22.090]  I mean, this is, because if it adds that little extra edge of people paying attention to what I'm saying, I mean, I could wear a crown like Queen Elizabeth.
[01:03:22.853 --> 01:03:39.269]  I could give myself, I could call myself CEO of Infowars.com and the biggest alternative media multimedia empire in the world and wear a red cape and have bugles.
[01:03:39.269 --> 01:03:40.250]  Being sarcastic, but...
[01:03:41.502 --> 01:03:42.383]  Humans are primitive.
[01:03:42.383 --> 01:03:43.804]  We like to dress up.
[01:03:43.804 --> 01:03:48.047]  The Queen of England wears a royal headdress, and everyone steps and fetches.
[01:03:48.047 --> 01:03:49.509]  Your Majesty!
[01:03:49.509 --> 01:03:54.152]  Billionaires, movie stars, come and bow.
[01:03:54.152 --> 01:03:55.113]  I mean, I wouldn't bow.
[01:03:55.113 --> 01:04:01.018]  I'd tell her, hey, uh, Dracul.
[01:04:01.018 --> 01:04:02.259]  In fact, I've got some articles.
[01:04:02.259 --> 01:04:05.342]  The Duchess of Cambridge, pregnant, could be twins.
[01:04:05.342 --> 01:04:06.102]  Kate!
[01:04:06.102 --> 01:04:07.984]  And it says she's the first commoner ever.
[01:04:09.301 --> 01:04:11.542]  In the House of Windsor, that fake PR name.
[01:04:11.542 --> 01:04:12.943]  It's Saxe-Coburg-Gofa.
[01:04:12.943 --> 01:04:14.403]  They ought to be proud of their German heritage.
[01:04:14.403 --> 01:04:15.504]  Oh, but they're not German.
[01:04:15.504 --> 01:04:17.225]  Well, ought to be proud of your Romanian heritage.
[01:04:17.225 --> 01:04:18.285]  Nothing wrong with that.
[01:04:18.285 --> 01:04:20.726]  Except you are Dracul.
[01:04:20.726 --> 01:04:22.307]  By the way, listeners always go check that.
[01:04:22.307 --> 01:04:25.088]  And I see people freaking out in the YouTube videos when I mention that.
[01:04:25.088 --> 01:04:26.369]  They go, I went and looked it up.
[01:04:26.369 --> 01:04:27.769]  It's AP Reuters, BBC.
[01:04:27.769 --> 01:04:28.590]  It's true.
[01:04:28.590 --> 01:04:30.631]  Prince Charles lives in the Dracula Castle.
[01:04:30.631 --> 01:04:34.032]  What do you think, I just made that up?
[01:04:34.032 --> 01:04:37.874]  Oh, the people that rule the world just so happen to be from the House of Dracula, the dragon.
[01:04:39.517 --> 01:04:46.079]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[01:05:08.095 --> 01:05:14.861]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.

[01:05:25.811 --> 01:05:27.773]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[01:05:29.935 --> 01:05:36.879]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[01:05:36.879 --> 01:05:48.125]  But rather we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[01:06:01.735 --> 01:06:07.339]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[01:06:07.339 --> 01:06:10.581]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[01:06:10.581 --> 01:06:13.403]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[01:06:13.403 --> 01:06:16.405]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[01:06:16.405 --> 01:06:19.407]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[01:06:19.907 --> 01:06:25.110]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[01:06:25.110 --> 01:06:27.792]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.
[01:06:27.792 --> 01:06:31.434]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[01:06:31.434 --> 01:06:35.217]  I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.
[01:06:35.217 --> 01:06:38.839]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials.
[01:06:39.119 --> 01:06:43.522]  And you can start with a holiday gift pack that's normally $80, now under $50.
[01:06:43.522 --> 01:06:46.705]  Remember, I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[01:06:46.705 --> 01:06:51.508]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:06:51.508 --> 01:06:54.650]  Would you rather prepare six months too early or one day too late?
[01:06:54.650 --> 01:06:59.154]  409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:07:00.581 --> 01:07:06.365]  Sodium fluoride in the body reduces IQ and increases cancers.
[01:07:06.365 --> 01:07:13.731]  Unfortunately, fluoride and its derivatives are only one of hundreds of toxins being added to our drinking water.
[01:07:13.731 --> 01:07:16.453]  We're battling the globalists on so many fronts.
[01:07:16.453 --> 01:07:22.518]  Health is an area where we can all take control of our lives, and it all starts with that basic building block of water.
[01:07:23.178 --> 01:07:26.222]  It is time to purify our family's water.
[01:07:26.222 --> 01:07:33.090]  The ProPure filtration system with added fluoride filters is the best system for my research to protect you and your family.
[01:07:33.090 --> 01:07:38.156]  Infowarstore.com already has the lowest prices on ProPure water filtration.
[01:07:38.396 --> 01:07:44.422]  But until December 10th, we are going to offer 15% off the already lowest price.
[01:07:44.422 --> 01:07:46.744]  I know what I'm giving my family this Christmas.
[01:07:46.744 --> 01:07:47.484]  ProPure.
[01:07:47.484 --> 01:07:53.490]  Go to infowarestore.com and get 15% off the already lowest price out there with the code WATER15.
[01:07:53.490 --> 01:07:55.792]  WATER15 and you get 15% off at infowarestore.com.
[01:08:05.390 --> 01:08:10.237]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:10.237 --> 01:08:11.819]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.819 --> 01:08:13.361]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.361 --> 01:08:17.547]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.547 --> 01:08:21.612]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:25.276 --> 01:08:37.388]  Alright, if you just joined us on this Tuesday, the 4th day of December, 2012 edition, InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are absolutely full of incredible information today.
[01:08:38.029 --> 01:08:40.710]  And I'm going to ask Lindsey Williams' take on gun control coming up.
[01:08:40.710 --> 01:08:45.751]  He's going to be our guest for the balance of the hour and then Max Keiser on the economy and a lot more.
[01:08:45.751 --> 01:08:48.231]  Great financial insider in the third hour today.
[01:08:48.231 --> 01:08:49.712]  We'll open some phones up for him then.
[01:08:49.712 --> 01:08:58.254]  But we're going to spend our time here with Lindsey today until the last 10 minutes or so and then we'll take just a few questions from callers as well.
[01:08:58.254 --> 01:09:04.075]  So if you have any questions for Lindsey Williams, we'll give that number out coming up a little bit later after we get his latest intel.
[01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:08.945]  But first off, anti-gun sports columnist Jason Whitlock.
[01:09:08.945 --> 01:09:11.288]  The NRA is the new KKK.
[01:09:11.288 --> 01:09:13.550]  And I played the clip last hour.
[01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:15.232]  It's up at InfoWars.com.
[01:09:15.232 --> 01:09:16.754]  I'll play it later for Lindsey.
[01:09:16.754 --> 01:09:20.118]  That's where you get the latest info he's got from his insider sources.
[01:09:20.959 --> 01:09:23.042]  Pastor Lindsey Williams.
[01:09:23.042 --> 01:09:25.464]  But this is so over the top, but it's not.
[01:09:25.464 --> 01:09:35.455]  I mean, if you don't like socialism, you don't like your taxes being raised, you don't like having your guns restricted, you don't like your freedoms being taken, you are a racist.
[01:09:35.455 --> 01:09:37.497]  And if you don't like wars, you're with Al Qaeda.
[01:09:38.058 --> 01:09:41.522]  Of course, here's McClatchy News Bureau, Washington Bureau.
[01:09:41.522 --> 01:09:47.748]  Al-Qaeda-linked group, Syria Rebels, once denied, now key to anti-Assad victories.
[01:09:47.748 --> 01:09:49.229]  They are the main force.
[01:09:49.229 --> 01:09:53.514]  Our government's given them thousands of missiles, including anti-aircraft missiles, to Al-Qaeda.
[01:09:54.594 --> 01:10:00.038]  Okay, but you need to give your rights up and don't you dare film police on the street because you might be Al Qaeda.
[01:10:00.038 --> 01:10:05.262]  Then all the police training manuals say gun owners, conservatives, returning veterans, libertarians.
[01:10:05.262 --> 01:10:06.643]  We are the terror threat.
[01:10:06.643 --> 01:10:12.147]  Homeland Security, the NSA wiretaps, it's all for us if we don't like the globalist takeover.
[01:10:12.147 --> 01:10:13.929]  The foreign banks that have taken America over.
[01:10:15.805 --> 01:10:21.429]  They brag in the Financial Times, the BBC, Reuters, everything.
[01:10:21.429 --> 01:10:24.051]  CNBC, we've played the clips, our article.
[01:10:24.051 --> 01:10:25.673]  Banks declare they've conquered the U.S.
[01:10:25.673 --> 01:10:26.213]  and Europe.
[01:10:26.213 --> 01:10:28.375]  Dozens of links with them admitting it.
[01:10:28.375 --> 01:10:29.976]  This is the reality.
[01:10:29.976 --> 01:10:34.480]  And they're gonna blow stuff up and blame it on the Patriot movement, okay?
[01:10:36.375 --> 01:10:41.739]  They've even got army documents out we've covered where they're saying that the Tea Party is going to link up with Al-Qaeda.
[01:10:41.739 --> 01:10:43.741]  I mean, you're like, that's ridiculous.
[01:10:43.741 --> 01:10:44.922]  They'll do it.
[01:10:44.922 --> 01:10:53.909]  They'll get drugged up, Patsy's, you know, Billy Bob with a John Deere hat and put him next to Habib Ahmed and, you know, come take our guns.
[01:10:53.909 --> 01:10:55.150]  I mean, these people mean business.
[01:10:55.150 --> 01:11:00.094]  They ship guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment and kill thousands so they could ban guns but got caught.
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:03.961]  So there you go, the government runs Al-Qaeda.
[01:11:03.961 --> 01:11:07.642]  It's not the entire government, it's the foreign banking cartel.
[01:11:07.642 --> 01:11:10.363]  Some of the other news we've got here.
[01:11:10.363 --> 01:11:12.824]  This is as bad as a world war.
[01:11:12.824 --> 01:11:19.446]  Bank of England bosses grim view of financial crisis which has left a debt that will quote be paid by our grandchildren.
[01:11:20.185 --> 01:11:29.168]  This is a global crisis, engineered, impossible to pay back, 1.5 quadrille, 1,500 trill, 644 trill is our debt.
[01:11:29.168 --> 01:11:40.471]  JP Morgan claims they control the government to sign us onto their debt, while claiming we're bankrupt when we're not, to then raise taxes to pay corporate welfare to them, to destroy the economy, to consolidate it.
[01:11:40.471 --> 01:11:42.632]  They want to make you poor.
[01:11:42.632 --> 01:11:46.113]  World Net Daily reports Dr. Corsi, who's an incredible economist in his own right,
[01:11:48.094 --> 01:11:51.215]  $3 trillion tax increase on middle class.
[01:11:51.215 --> 01:11:52.535]  That's his breakdown.
[01:11:52.535 --> 01:11:58.558]  The Republicans have announced giant tax increases as their compromise on the upper middle class and wealthy.
[01:11:58.558 --> 01:12:00.579]  And that's how they do it.
[01:12:00.579 --> 01:12:02.339]  The bankers want the middle class money.
[01:12:02.339 --> 01:12:06.321]  So Obama says, I want financial dictatorship and $3 trillion in taxes.
[01:12:06.321 --> 01:12:08.302]  And the Republicans go, how dare you?
[01:12:08.302 --> 01:12:11.543]  Only $900 billion in new taxes on the middle class.
[01:12:12.063 --> 01:12:14.545]  And to get rid of all these different deductions.
[01:12:14.545 --> 01:12:15.245]  $600 billion there.
[01:12:15.245 --> 01:12:17.266]  They've already gotten rid of most of the deductions, folks.
[01:12:17.266 --> 01:12:21.129]  And again, it will put this economy into a stall, which is the plan.
[01:12:21.129 --> 01:12:23.650]  IRS aims to clarify investment tax.
[01:12:23.650 --> 01:12:40.361]  They've got a new 3.8% tax on most of your investments, on top of your capital gains, and on top of all the dividend taxes, and on top of all the other income taxes, and the new VAT they've got at state levels, and the federal VAT, and the new carbon taxes, and all the hidden fees.
[01:12:41.741 --> 01:12:47.784]  Continuing on CBS, Cheesecake Factory CEO warns Obamacare will be very costly.
[01:12:47.784 --> 01:12:50.926]  Yeah, just get ready for everybody to become part-time, which is what they want.
[01:12:50.926 --> 01:12:52.927]  They want to make you poor.
[01:12:52.927 --> 01:12:58.550]  They know when they raise taxes it kills the economy and makes less money come in, which is what the bankers want.
[01:12:58.550 --> 01:13:02.532]  I've got articles here where Obama says he wants us to go off the fiscal cliff.
[01:13:02.532 --> 01:13:04.253]  They want us bankrupted!
[01:13:04.933 --> 01:13:06.154]  What do banks want?
[01:13:06.154 --> 01:13:08.175]  You paid for 20 years on a farm.
[01:13:08.175 --> 01:13:19.143]  In that 20th year, folks, in that 19th year up to that 20th, they will try to call provisos that you didn't understand when your dad signed it and come try to take your property.
[01:13:19.143 --> 01:13:22.125]  Anybody who knows about farming and ranching knows this.
[01:13:23.334 --> 01:13:46.927]  Okay, because my entire family has been farming and ranching, and I've had a lot of extended family who's gone and, you know, mortgage property when somebody's got cancer, and 20 years later, you know, they come and take it the last year, and call in the, you know, the, you know, say, oh, there's extra interest we didn't tell you about, or three or four years before it's due, they say we want it all this month.
[01:13:49.046 --> 01:13:52.109]  The megabanks create all the fiat out of nothing.
[01:13:52.109 --> 01:13:53.510]  They want you to go bankrupt.
[01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:58.974]  Now, joining us, and I've got a lot of other news coming up, is Pastor Lindsey Williams.
[01:13:58.974 --> 01:14:07.300]  Back in the 80s, he wrote the bestseller, The Energy Non-Crisis, saying there was unlimited oil in Alaska more than Saudi Arabia.
[01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:10.102]  Then they made a deal with the Arabs in the 1970s.
[01:14:10.102 --> 01:14:12.964]  This was all later declassified in the 90s.
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:26.049]  To to to not allow development here in the United States basically and to as long as the Arabs Did all their oil trading of the dollar to cement it?
[01:14:26.049 --> 01:14:36.637]  as kind of a Bretton Woods to They claim Bretton Woods to a few years ago, but this was the real Bretton Woods to to cement the dollar as the World Reserve currency now He called it
[01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:44.184]  Five years ago, five and a half years ago, he said oil will go from $60 a barrel to $150 in the next year.
[01:14:44.184 --> 01:14:45.785]  Everybody laughed at exactly that.
[01:14:45.785 --> 01:14:46.986]  Then he said now it will drop from $149 to $40.
[01:14:46.986 --> 01:14:49.628]  It actually went to about $38.
[01:14:49.628 --> 01:14:51.209]  Everybody laughed at that.
[01:14:51.209 --> 01:14:52.870]  It happened.
[01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:55.031]  I know who his big oil company exec people are.
[01:14:55.031 --> 01:14:56.112]  One of them has been announced now.
[01:14:56.112 --> 01:14:58.634]  He died of cancer a year and a half ago.
[01:14:58.634 --> 01:15:00.475]  The other, I know who it is.
[01:15:04.201 --> 01:15:09.264]  Stan Montee found out who it was, called a guy, the guy said, yes, that's true, but I'm not going to talk to you.
[01:15:09.264 --> 01:15:18.729]  Now, the point is, these guys also, you know, could be wrong sometimes, because even though they're high-level globalists, I don't just go with everything they say and I don't completely trust them.
[01:15:18.729 --> 01:15:24.112]  And, you know, they said, they've said some things, too, that haven't happened exactly right.
[01:15:24.112 --> 01:15:26.433]  And I want Lindsey to, you know, correct me if I'm wrong here.
[01:15:26.433 --> 01:15:29.715]  Lindsey, you did say about two years ago there'd be giant discoveries
[01:15:30.735 --> 01:15:31.675]  That we know we're already there.
[01:15:31.675 --> 01:15:36.577]  All over the U.S., a new oil boom, that we would become independent and double-cross the Arabs.
[01:15:36.577 --> 01:15:37.877]  Now things change, as you said.
[01:15:37.877 --> 01:15:42.859]  Now Obama's kind of been trying to double-cross the oil groups for the Arabs.
[01:15:42.859 --> 01:15:46.340]  But that's all a way to rope-a-dope the Arabs, I believe.
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:51.604]  But, you know, you're saying the dollar will die by the end of this year.
[01:15:51.604 --> 01:15:53.426]  Well, here we are.
[01:15:53.426 --> 01:16:02.673]  And then I talked to a lot of other insiders and see the news that they're going to go ahead and energy develop as a way to try to keep the dollar propped up and extend this out so they can pick winners and losers.
[01:16:02.673 --> 01:16:04.275]  Now, this is a very complex issue.
[01:16:04.275 --> 01:16:11.181]  I know you're chomping at the bit to talk, but I know you haven't been on the air in over a month because you've got a lot of new information.
[01:16:11.181 --> 01:16:12.062]  But just in it.
[01:16:12.762 --> 01:16:14.323]  You don't thank me for coming on either.
[01:16:14.323 --> 01:16:15.523]  We appreciate you for coming on.
[01:16:15.523 --> 01:16:23.207]  But in a nutshell, what is happening, what is going to happen, and have, I mean, has your source been wrong about anything?
[01:16:23.207 --> 01:16:27.489]  Your sources, or am I misinterpreting some of this?
[01:16:27.489 --> 01:16:37.334]  After the election, Alex, I contacted my lead friend, whom you just mentioned, whom you know, and I asked him the question, what can we expect for the next four years?
[01:16:38.499 --> 01:16:48.605]  The reply I got, the only way I know to describe it, is the most startling thing that any person has ever heard since the founding of the United States of America.
[01:16:48.605 --> 01:16:56.230]  I was given ten agendas that the American people will face in the next four years' time.
[01:16:56.230 --> 01:17:05.275]  It took me three hours and twenty-nine minutes to explain this on DVD just to be able to tell what this man had told me.
[01:17:06.115 --> 01:17:09.356]  Now, I have all 10 of those agendas in front of me.
[01:17:09.356 --> 01:17:11.437]  We'll do the best we can today to cover them.
[01:17:11.437 --> 01:17:14.419]  People positively must know what they are.
[01:17:14.419 --> 01:17:15.919]  And you must know what to do about it.
[01:17:15.919 --> 01:17:16.640]  Okay, well I'll say this.
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:23.643]  About 90% of what these guys have told you has been startlingly accurate.
[01:17:23.643 --> 01:17:29.105]  But, then why are they telling you this info, and then some of it has not happened like they said.
[01:17:29.105 --> 01:17:32.407]  Like, you know, Obama isn't going to win, and things like that.
[01:17:33.874 --> 01:17:36.758]  Well, they didn't say that Obama was not going to win.
[01:17:36.758 --> 01:17:40.043]  And this is where people misinterpret what the elite have told me.
[01:17:40.043 --> 01:17:44.229]  The elite told me that they did not want Obama back in.
[01:17:44.229 --> 01:17:47.594]  But as you stated a moment ago, these elite are not God.
[01:17:47.594 --> 01:17:48.675]  They just think they are.
[01:17:49.336 --> 01:17:54.799]  Now, they have ten agendas that they have given me that will be carried out.
[01:17:54.799 --> 01:18:02.863]  Some of them are theirs, some of them are Mr. Obama's, and some of them are the... and you're going to hear some expressions today you've never heard before.
[01:18:02.863 --> 01:18:07.085]  I'm going to give you some buzzwords, and you watch them happen over four years.
[01:18:07.085 --> 01:18:12.828]  There is a renegade elite out there, and I'll attempt to explain it depending on how much time we have today.
[01:18:12.828 --> 01:18:16.049]  Let me just give you some of the agendas.
[01:18:16.049 --> 01:18:17.410]  All I'm going to do is give you...
[01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:19.631]  I'm going to skip this network break.
[01:18:19.631 --> 01:18:24.795]  I really shouldn't do it, but I'm going to skip it because I went to a little bit late here and Max Keiser is coming up the next hour at five after.
[01:18:24.795 --> 01:18:26.616]  But just listen for just a moment.
[01:18:26.616 --> 01:18:31.759]  Answer my first question, though, because I mean, I hope they're wrong or I hope they've changed their plan.
[01:18:31.759 --> 01:18:43.987]  I mean, I know they told you things that did come true that showed total inside control, like the fuel, things like that, the housing market would be crashed, you know, two years before it happened, exactly how it would be done, all of that.
[01:18:43.987 --> 01:18:47.370]  What I'm asking you here is, Lindsey Williams, Pastor Williams,
[01:18:48.310 --> 01:18:49.491]  I'm asking you this.
[01:18:49.491 --> 01:18:52.774]  Are they still planning to kill the dollar this year?
[01:18:52.774 --> 01:18:55.036]  Well, that's exactly what they told me.
[01:18:55.036 --> 01:19:01.742]  But, let me put it in their terms, so that I don't misinterpret what their intentions are.
[01:19:01.742 --> 01:19:04.764]  There will not be a collapse yet.
[01:19:04.764 --> 01:19:08.708]  The elite do not want a collapse.
[01:19:08.708 --> 01:19:10.910]  And I think Ron Paul would not yet.
[01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:13.472]  Now, it is going to happen, but not yet.
[01:19:14.136 --> 01:19:21.240]  Now, you remember last year, Alex, you came to me and I went to my elite friend and I said, is there going to be a collapse in the next three months?
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:22.500]  And he laughed and said no.
[01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:24.601]  And I came back on your show and told it.
[01:19:24.601 --> 01:19:36.847]  While all the other newsletter writers were saying there was going to be a collapse when Greece collapsed and all the rest, I'm telling you right now, and I'll give them to you quickly, that the elite do not want a collapse yet.
[01:19:36.847 --> 01:19:39.289]  They have not created enough debt.
[01:19:39.289 --> 01:19:39.769]  Secondly,
[01:19:40.409 --> 01:19:42.631]  Please understand these words.
[01:19:42.631 --> 01:19:44.693]  The second agenda.
[01:19:44.693 --> 01:19:47.175]  The first debt creation.
[01:19:47.175 --> 01:19:51.399]  I hope you're hearing these words and I'll attempt to explain it in detail if I can.
[01:19:51.399 --> 01:19:54.962]  There is going to be first debt creation.
[01:19:54.962 --> 01:19:57.704]  Next, the middle class.
[01:19:57.704 --> 01:19:58.665]  I was horrified.
[01:19:59.352 --> 01:20:03.496]  When I heard what they said, that their agenda's off for the middle class.
[01:20:03.496 --> 01:20:07.620]  You're hearing all of this, Tommy Rock, about taxing the rich.
[01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:09.962]  Don't you pay an ounce of attention to it?
[01:20:09.962 --> 01:20:12.845]  Oh sure, the rich are going to be taxed a little bit.
[01:20:12.845 --> 01:20:15.348]  You haven't seen anything yet.
[01:20:15.348 --> 01:20:20.593]  The middle class of America is going to be taxed into oblivion.
[01:20:20.593 --> 01:20:22.474]  And I'm going to give you the details of it.
[01:20:23.115 --> 01:20:25.377]  No, that's actually in the Republican and Democratic plan.
[01:20:25.377 --> 01:20:30.182]  They're going to get rid of all the exemptions and tax all the middle class 401ks.
[01:20:30.182 --> 01:20:31.023]  It's all being announced.
[01:20:31.023 --> 01:20:32.665]  They're going to tax the dividends.
[01:20:32.665 --> 01:20:33.886]  They're going to tax it all.
[01:20:33.886 --> 01:20:36.589]  It is outrageous.
[01:20:36.589 --> 01:20:38.511]  And the Republicans are going along with it.
[01:20:41.002 --> 01:20:43.023]  Alex, I have been given a formula.
[01:20:43.023 --> 01:20:46.945]  I'm going to give it on your program today if we have the time.
[01:20:46.945 --> 01:20:54.808]  I've been given a devaluation formula so that you can know when the dollar is going to collapse.
[01:20:54.808 --> 01:20:55.468]  Now, that's right.
[01:20:55.468 --> 01:20:56.669]  You heard me correctly.
[01:20:56.669 --> 01:21:02.131]  I have the formula right here before me, exactly as my friend has given it to me.
[01:21:02.131 --> 01:21:02.451]  Again,
[01:21:03.283 --> 01:21:05.445]  The debt limit is going to be suspended.
[01:21:05.445 --> 01:21:06.947]  Mark my words.
[01:21:06.947 --> 01:21:12.253]  You are going to see, as a result of this, some very unusual things happen in America.
[01:21:12.253 --> 01:21:17.398]  Again, the dollar will be phased out over the next four years.
[01:21:17.398 --> 01:21:20.742]  Did you hear me say, over the next four years?
[01:21:20.742 --> 01:21:23.965]  This is not going to take place instantaneously.
[01:21:24.005 --> 01:21:25.447]  Well, that's what I've always said.
[01:21:25.447 --> 01:21:27.589]  Okay, that's what I always said.
[01:21:27.589 --> 01:21:37.980]  Well, then why did the former oil company CEO, one of the big three, why did he tell you that the implosion would be signaled by December?
[01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:42.626]  Has there been a change of plan or was he trying to manipulate the markets?
[01:21:43.487 --> 01:21:45.669]  No change in plan whatsoever.
[01:21:45.669 --> 01:21:50.093]  You heard me say that the elite had told me that the dollar would be dead by the end of 2012.
[01:21:50.093 --> 01:21:56.679]  And if you give me enough time on your program today, I'm going to prove to you that the dollar is already dead.
[01:21:56.679 --> 01:21:58.962]  I'm going to give you the exact words that they said to me.
[01:21:58.962 --> 01:21:59.602]  No, no, you're right.
[01:21:59.602 --> 01:22:00.963]  They've already... That's what I've been saying.
[01:22:00.963 --> 01:22:01.504]  That's why it is.
[01:22:01.564 --> 01:22:02.844]  Yeah, there's already a war with Iran.
[01:22:02.844 --> 01:22:03.925]  There's already a war with Syria.
[01:22:03.925 --> 01:22:05.345]  People are like, where's the war?
[01:22:05.345 --> 01:22:11.547]  They're already moving to SDRs to back up the derivatives above the dollar and are already moving to a basket.
[01:22:11.547 --> 01:22:14.288]  China and the BRICS and others are leaving the dollar.
[01:22:14.288 --> 01:22:15.368]  They're going into gold.
[01:22:15.368 --> 01:22:18.989]  I agree that the rush to the exits is about to start.
[01:22:18.989 --> 01:22:22.010]  But at the same time, the people are getting up now.
[01:22:22.010 --> 01:22:23.231]  The rush is about to start.
[01:22:24.071 --> 01:22:28.614]  I didn't see it in my experts, which I go with a wide spectrum of experts.
[01:22:28.614 --> 01:22:37.300]  They said it would be a long decline, but then I guess that's what they meant with their riddle then, saying that the dollar would be dead by the end of 2012.
[01:22:38.749 --> 01:22:39.850]  The dollar is dead.
[01:22:39.850 --> 01:22:41.030]  It's already dead right now.
[01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:47.714]  The American people, the chickens just haven't come home to roost and the American people don't realize what the rest... Okay, come on.
[01:22:47.714 --> 01:22:49.374]  So it's like Spock in Wrath of Khan.
[01:22:49.374 --> 01:22:52.136]  He's been radiated and they say don't go in and try to save him.
[01:22:52.136 --> 01:22:52.916]  He's dead already.
[01:22:52.916 --> 01:22:54.277]  He just hadn't physically died yet.
[01:22:55.031 --> 01:22:56.613]  Okay, let me give you an example.
[01:22:56.613 --> 01:22:58.235]  This happened last week.
[01:22:58.235 --> 01:22:59.397]  You heard about it.
[01:22:59.397 --> 01:23:00.979]  It was on the national news.
[01:23:00.979 --> 01:23:03.222]  You know what happened in Phnom Penh.
[01:23:03.222 --> 01:23:11.774]  Fifteen Asian nations, comprising half of the world's population, and they met together in what they call the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.
[01:23:12.652 --> 01:23:15.454]  And the United States of America was excluded.
[01:23:15.454 --> 01:23:17.736]  Our president went over there to attend the summit.
[01:23:42.452 --> 01:23:43.513]  We're good to go.
[01:23:58.573 --> 01:24:11.099]  Because when things like this went on pen and what happened with BRICS when they met together and said we aren't going to use the American dollar any longer, the dollar, I tell you, is exactly what the elite told me back a year ago.
[01:24:11.099 --> 01:24:23.225]  The dollar is already dead and six to nine months from now, when these trillions of unused dollars come home, it is going to be massive chaos in this country with the dollar like you've never seen before.
[01:24:23.225 --> 01:24:23.305]  Alex,
[01:24:24.045 --> 01:24:34.470]  You need to understand the total program of the elite as they've given it to me so that you can comprehend what these people are doing.
[01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:49.218]  Well no, I agree with what you're saying and I also monitor the CNBC and others where they give you a lot of spin but they also want to cover their bases with irrational exuberance type statements when their controllers are the authors of the irrational exuberance.
[01:24:49.218 --> 01:24:49.518]  They want to
[01:24:49.858 --> 01:24:54.041]  Warn you right before they draw the trap once it's already too late.
[01:24:54.041 --> 01:24:59.025]  They're saying now, there's no way we're going to get out of some moderate inflation.
[01:24:59.025 --> 01:25:00.266]  Get ready for it.
[01:25:00.266 --> 01:25:03.608]  Inflation is already rampant in so many sectors.
[01:25:03.608 --> 01:25:07.591]  They just make the bag of chips smaller, the bag of tides smaller.
[01:25:07.591 --> 01:25:09.113]  They make the meat thinner.
[01:25:09.113 --> 01:25:11.074]  They make the packaging different.
[01:25:11.074 --> 01:25:17.299]  Everything is exploding in prices year after year after year.
[01:25:19.059 --> 01:25:23.065]  Alex, there are some... I don't know how to say this.
[01:25:23.065 --> 01:25:25.708]  There's so many factors here I've got to cover.
[01:25:25.708 --> 01:25:29.633]  There are some new factions out there right now that nobody's ever heard about.
[01:25:29.633 --> 01:25:32.137]  You haven't even heard about it, Alex.
[01:25:32.137 --> 01:25:32.837]  Please forgive me.
[01:25:32.837 --> 01:25:33.759]  You hear about everything.
[01:25:34.372 --> 01:25:36.335]  But no news letter has come out with this.
[01:25:36.335 --> 01:25:42.604]  If I had not been for my elite friend telling me, and I'm going to... Okay, just run through your ten bullet points.
[01:25:42.604 --> 01:25:45.948]  ...agendas of the elite.
[01:25:45.948 --> 01:25:49.153]  Okay, run through the ten, just list them, and then go back into it.
[01:25:49.153 --> 01:25:49.834]  I think that's the way to go.
[01:25:50.543 --> 01:25:52.125]  Well, that's what I've been doing right here.
[01:25:52.125 --> 01:25:54.167]  I said there's not going to be a collapse yet.
[01:25:54.167 --> 01:25:55.889]  The elite are not ready for it.
[01:25:55.889 --> 01:25:58.231]  There's going to be forced debt creation.
[01:25:58.231 --> 01:25:59.753]  I hope you've caught that.
[01:25:59.753 --> 01:26:02.536]  The middle class is going to be taxed into oblivion.
[01:26:02.536 --> 01:26:05.579]  Folks, you have got to know the intricate details of this.
[01:26:06.199 --> 01:26:09.123]  The devaluation formula, I've been giving it to you.
[01:26:09.123 --> 01:26:16.593]  You can know, when you hear it from me, as the elite gave it to me, you can know where you are in the devaluation of the dollar.
[01:26:16.593 --> 01:26:19.777]  The debt limit will be suspended, the dollar will be phased out.
[01:26:19.777 --> 01:26:21.119]  I'm giving you these one at a time.
[01:26:21.779 --> 01:26:26.583]  The dollar will be phased out, and I have the details as to how they're going to do it.
[01:26:26.583 --> 01:26:30.386]  There's new factions out there that you've never heard about before.
[01:26:30.386 --> 01:26:33.628]  Again, this one I hope you find very startling.
[01:26:33.628 --> 01:26:37.832]  There will never be another honest election in the United States of America.
[01:26:37.832 --> 01:26:39.373]  It's already planned.
[01:26:39.373 --> 01:26:42.115]  It is part of the agenda of the elite.
[01:26:42.115 --> 01:26:45.397]  I have been told where gold prices are going to go by the end of 2016.
[01:26:45.397 --> 01:26:48.340]  They've given me the figures on it.
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:27:03.914]  And Alex, I think probably, you know, my being a minister all these years, I think probably one of the most startling things I've heard from my elite friend is the agenda of the Devil's Messiah program, which you've heard me talk about on your program before.
[01:27:03.914 --> 01:27:10.860]  For the next four years, the agenda of that Devil's Messiah program will almost curl your toenails again.
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:20.465]  There are millions of Muslims that will be brought into the United States of America and made citizens over the next four years.
[01:27:20.465 --> 01:27:33.192]  And then, when they told me about what's going to happen to the medical system, the last item is you must become your own doctor and become that own doctor quick and know how to do it, Alex.
[01:27:33.192 --> 01:27:33.952]  Wow.
[01:27:33.952 --> 01:27:34.372]  You know what?
[01:27:34.372 --> 01:27:39.175]  I actually have in my stack, and was going to try to get to it today, where no one
[01:27:40.382 --> 01:27:50.028]  They're saying it's not even one-tenth the number of people that wanted to go see Obama's first coronation four years ago, and that no one wants to go.
[01:27:50.028 --> 01:27:52.209]  And I'm not saying Mitt Romney was good.
[01:27:52.209 --> 01:28:05.236]  He was owned by the same people, but obviously they wanted to put Obama back in because he was the more effective evil, not the lesser of two evils, but the more effective of two evils, as Cynthia McKinney said last week, former congresswoman, on the show.
[01:28:05.236 --> 01:28:09.139]  But clearly, Beth Harris, the top election fraud expert, been a Democrat.
[01:28:09.799 --> 01:28:14.543]  I said, you know, the evidence is they pretty much stole the election for Obama.
[01:28:14.543 --> 01:28:15.784]  And that's what you see now.
[01:28:15.784 --> 01:28:21.108]  They're going to go to full fraud and just say, oh, this gives us a mandate to take your guns.
[01:28:21.108 --> 01:28:22.129]  He got reelected.
[01:28:22.129 --> 01:28:24.591]  This gives us a mandate to raise your taxes.
[01:28:24.591 --> 01:28:34.879]  They're calmly announcing giant taxes on basically all mutual funds, stock investments, portfolios, 401ks that are invested in that.
[01:28:34.879 --> 01:28:37.401]  I mean, this is off the charts.
[01:28:38.141 --> 01:28:42.302]  And it backs up everything you're saying, and it's just over.
[01:28:42.302 --> 01:28:46.023]  They're taking over unless we fully realize it.
[01:28:46.023 --> 01:28:47.204]  Alex, you're exactly right.
[01:28:47.204 --> 01:28:54.206]  Now let me go into some of these one by one, because people, you positively must know the solution to all of this.
[01:28:54.206 --> 01:28:57.547]  And when I got through producing that 3 hour and 29 minutes of DVDs, I was horrified.
[01:29:03.263 --> 01:29:07.346]  Well, we're going to break here, and we're going to plug that as well, because I know it's serious.
[01:29:07.346 --> 01:29:09.427]  I needed to let people know what I had to do.
[01:29:09.427 --> 01:29:10.808]  I had no choice.
[01:29:10.808 --> 01:29:22.435]  I could not morally, I could not conscientiously reproduce a second DVD series that they both put together entitled, How to Survive the Next Four Years, and it's over two hours long.
[01:29:22.435 --> 01:29:24.176]  Now let me go into the agendas a little bit.
[01:29:25.137 --> 01:29:26.817]  I'm also going to tell them where to get that.
[01:29:26.817 --> 01:29:29.258]  Obviously, prophecyclub.com, folks.
[01:29:29.258 --> 01:29:32.219]  He only does this every once in a while when he gets a bunch of info.
[01:29:32.219 --> 01:29:33.659]  He said oil will go to 150.
[01:29:33.659 --> 01:29:35.820]  Everybody laughed, went to it.
[01:29:35.820 --> 01:29:37.960]  Now it's going to go down to 40.
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:38.780]  Happened.
[01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:42.241]  They're going to plunge the stock market.
[01:29:42.241 --> 01:29:44.502]  All of it, with accuracy.
[01:29:44.502 --> 01:29:46.542]  And I hope he's wrong this time.
[01:29:46.542 --> 01:29:49.963]  But we'll go through his sources and intel straight ahead.
[01:29:49.963 --> 01:29:51.363]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.363 --> 01:29:52.864]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.887 --> 01:29:56.577]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.766 --> 01:30:04.867]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu, and other illnesses.
[01:30:04.867 --> 01:30:06.107]  Don't be one of them!

[01:30:21.611 --> 01:30:28.273]  Supernatural Silver is safe enough to consume every day, while powerful enough to destroy the causes of many serious diseases.

[01:30:45.496 --> 01:30:49.337]  It is virtually non-toxic and is emerging as a wonder of modern medicine.

[01:32:01.715 --> 01:32:07.297]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[01:32:07.297 --> 01:32:10.558]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[01:32:10.558 --> 01:32:13.360]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:16.361]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[01:32:16.361 --> 01:32:19.382]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[01:32:19.882 --> 01:32:25.084]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[01:32:25.084 --> 01:32:27.765]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.

[01:33:02.752 --> 01:33:04.333]  The Alex Jones Show.

[01:33:33.619 --> 01:33:35.580]  Monday through Friday, 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[01:33:35.580 --> 01:33:47.408]  Eastern, blasting out on XM 166, over 140 AM and FM affiliates, and the internet of course with the audio streams and the podcast and listen section at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:33:47.408 --> 01:33:51.811]  Now I'm chomping at the bit here with so many points and angles.
[01:33:51.811 --> 01:33:54.853]  I'm gonna give Pastor Williams the floor now for the balance of the hour.
[01:33:56.935 --> 01:34:02.938]  I'm going to give the number out so in like the last two little short segments, five minutes to the next hour, we're going to have a few quick questions.
[01:34:02.938 --> 01:34:04.118]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:34:04.118 --> 01:34:08.160]  800-259-9231 for quick questions for Pastor Williams, who I'm going to have on the show for a full hour next week.
[01:34:16.380 --> 01:34:17.461]  to flesh this out more.
[01:34:17.461 --> 01:34:19.183]  Now, I know who his sources are.
[01:34:19.183 --> 01:34:22.026]  One of them is public now, who died of cancer over a year ago.
[01:34:22.026 --> 01:34:31.235]  The other, again, gives him this info because I guess they kind of want to have a remnant out there that knows what's going on or it's guilt.
[01:34:31.235 --> 01:34:33.176]  I think that's basically what we've gotten from Lindsey.
[01:34:34.093 --> 01:34:37.478]  But it doesn't mean that it's all going to be 100% accurate.
[01:34:37.478 --> 01:34:40.502]  But it's been startlingly accurate on so many fronts.
[01:34:40.502 --> 01:34:42.265]  We're going to go back to him in a moment.
[01:34:42.265 --> 01:34:45.550]  And he has produced a new DVD breakdown.
[01:34:45.550 --> 01:34:48.714]  That's why he wouldn't come on in the last month since he got this info.
[01:34:49.455 --> 01:34:51.056]  And you can get that at prophecyclub.com.
[01:34:51.056 --> 01:34:56.020]  We'll give you all the numbers and names and things before he leaves us, but it's right there on the front page.
[01:34:56.020 --> 01:35:03.224]  Now, speaking of products, we fund ourselves with the best books, the best videos, the best information.
[01:35:03.224 --> 01:35:05.366]  Things that I think are really informative, we promote.
[01:35:06.937 --> 01:35:17.419]  And so when you buy an InfoWars.com ball cap, you support the broadcast and also wear your colors proud and you will meet a lot of like-minded patriots wearing a ball cap or InfoWars.com t-shirt.
[01:35:17.419 --> 01:35:22.620]  We have the new strategic relocation DVD film with Joel Skousen.
[01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:24.160]  It doesn't mean run off to the hills.
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:29.221]  It's got maps of all the major cities, breakdowns of the safest escape routes in those areas.
[01:35:29.221 --> 01:35:30.641]  It's an amazing documentary.
[01:35:30.641 --> 01:35:34.642]  The film is available 2 hours 40 something minutes at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:35:36.444 --> 01:35:41.189]  Uh, makes a great Christmas gift also for Christmas gifts or in the holidays period.
[01:35:41.189 --> 01:35:44.913]  We have never had an offer like this until this year.
[01:35:44.913 --> 01:35:46.554]  We have the regular Christmas special.
[01:35:47.791 --> 01:35:53.814]  Where you can get 5.3 months off free.
[01:35:53.814 --> 01:35:57.976]  You pay for a year, and instead of it being $5.95 a month, it goes down.
[01:35:57.976 --> 01:36:03.038]  If you do the math, it basically means you buy 6.7 months and you get 5.3 months free.
[01:36:03.038 --> 01:36:04.739]  That's how much is off the price.
[01:36:04.739 --> 01:36:05.579]  We've had that for now.
[01:36:05.579 --> 01:36:08.600]  This is our tenth year doing this.
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:11.202]  It's almost ten years we've had PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:36:11.202 --> 01:36:11.682]  Hard to believe.
[01:36:13.311 --> 01:36:19.593]  You can, though, this year, go create a username and passcode that you can share.
[01:36:19.593 --> 01:36:23.674]  Just a new username and passcode that's unique to the site.
[01:36:23.674 --> 01:36:29.496]  Takes about a minute to sign up, and 10 people can be logged on with that simultaneously.
[01:36:29.496 --> 01:36:33.798]  That's 10 memberships, or 59 cents a month per membership.
[01:36:33.798 --> 01:36:36.038]  You can't get a cup of coffee anywhere for 59 cents.
[01:36:36.038 --> 01:36:40.160]  Folks, that's an entire month for 59 cents.
[01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:40.920]  We've done the math.
[01:36:42.406 --> 01:36:49.992]  If everybody actually used it, we would go bankrupt with the bandwidth, but give away ten, maybe half your, the people you give it to will actually watch it.
[01:36:49.992 --> 01:37:06.326]  My book, Paul Watson's book, all my films, HD, nightly news, the live radio show, the video, archives, a bunch of other films, thousands and thousands of pieces of material, the commercial-free podcast, all of it up there, prisonplanet.tv or infowarsnews.com.
[01:37:06.326 --> 01:37:06.947]  And lastly,
[01:37:08.823 --> 01:37:18.471]  We've got Pro-Pure Water Filtration, the top of the line, best price, already lowest price, on the gravity-fed filters that cut out the hundreds of things that are being added to the tap water.
[01:37:18.471 --> 01:37:21.193]  Well water, all of it, you should run it through, this is what I use.
[01:37:21.193 --> 01:37:23.975]  We got 15% off with the promo code WATER15.
[01:37:23.975 --> 01:37:31.121]  Just put WATER15 in at infowarstore.com, or call us and say WATER15, 15% off, the already lowest price anywhere.
[01:37:31.121 --> 01:37:32.342]  And I challenge you to find a better price.
[01:37:33.062 --> 01:37:35.103]  On water filtration, gravity-fed, period.
[01:37:35.103 --> 01:37:37.523]  But this is ProPure that blows away the competition.
[01:37:37.523 --> 01:37:43.345]  We have side-by-side comparisons at InfowarStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:37:43.345 --> 01:37:44.425]  888-253-3139.
[01:37:44.425 --> 01:37:49.427]  Now, enough from me.
[01:37:49.427 --> 01:37:51.107]  Lindsey, I'm just so excited today.
[01:37:51.107 --> 01:37:58.089]  I'm going to shut up, go through the 10 points, go through their agenda, go through the takeover of the churches, which I first heard you talk about years ago.
[01:37:58.709 --> 01:38:19.213]  Now everybody I know, no matter what type of church, Catholic, Protestant, Methodist, you name it, it's turning your guns, world government's good, families are bad, you know, sex changes are good, and I mean, this is a takeover through the Faith-Based Initiative, so you've got the floor, just roll with it, go through it all, Pastor Lindsey Williams.
[01:38:20.265 --> 01:38:23.806]  Alex, you requested that I give you an exclusive on this.
[01:38:23.806 --> 01:38:28.727]  This is the first show that I have ever given this information on.
[01:38:28.727 --> 01:38:32.028]  Now, I do three other shows later in the day today.
[01:38:32.028 --> 01:38:36.689]  This is the first show that anybody has ever heard this information.
[01:38:36.689 --> 01:38:38.630]  Now, let me try to take them one at a time.
[01:38:38.630 --> 01:38:41.151]  I'll only be able to cover two or three of them.
[01:38:41.151 --> 01:38:45.352]  First of all, you heard me say a moment ago there's not going to be a collapse yet.
[01:38:45.352 --> 01:38:46.552]  Let me try to explain why.
[01:38:47.262 --> 01:38:52.886]  The elite, as they've explained it to me, have not created enough debt yet.
[01:38:52.886 --> 01:39:02.453]  They want such massive debt created that every country, every state, every city, every individual in the world is in such debt.
[01:39:02.453 --> 01:39:06.656]  Now, I want to give you an expression that you want to watch this happen.
[01:39:06.656 --> 01:39:09.598]  You won't hear this unless you know one of the elite.
[01:39:09.598 --> 01:39:12.300]  Forced debt creation.
[01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:13.601]  They are going to force debt.
[01:39:14.986 --> 01:39:23.611]  Well, not only countries, not only on the United States of America, states and cities in this country, but watch, let me try to give you an example right here.
[01:39:23.611 --> 01:39:29.875]  You remember years ago, I got an America Express credit card back 30, 40 years ago.
[01:39:29.875 --> 01:39:33.697]  And America Express back then was nothing but a credit card company.
[01:39:33.697 --> 01:39:37.860]  Last year, America Express was forced into becoming a bank.
[01:39:38.860 --> 01:39:40.763]  No longer a credit card company at all.
[01:39:40.763 --> 01:39:46.131]  This is part of what I'm trying to explain to you that the elite are going to fool us.
[01:39:46.883 --> 01:39:49.104]  We're good to go.
[01:40:11.412 --> 01:40:16.654]  They have the economy to the point that a person cannot afford to go to college and do it like I did it years ago.
[01:40:16.654 --> 01:40:21.795]  I worked my way through college bagging groceries, working here and yon every place I could.
[01:40:21.795 --> 01:40:23.395]  You can't do that anymore.
[01:40:23.395 --> 01:40:28.797]  They have convinced the students now that they must borrow money from the government and get student loans.
[01:40:28.797 --> 01:40:29.097]  This...
[01:40:30.003 --> 01:40:33.648]  This is the most dastardly thing you can imagine off.
[01:40:33.648 --> 01:40:40.077]  They've created it in the minds of the students that they've got to have these loans, and it is done intentionally.
[01:40:40.077 --> 01:40:46.165]  They took it out of the hands of private individuals and institutions, and the government now is handling it.
[01:40:46.645 --> 01:41:03.540]  They want those students to be so in debt when they come out of college that they are under the total control of the government and eventually will be able to go into bankruptcy and every bit of this is a part of the agenda of forced debt creation.
[01:41:03.540 --> 01:41:11.006]  Now, this physical cliff you're hearing about right now, it's the biggest bag of wind I think I've ever heard in my life.
[01:41:12.010 --> 01:41:15.113]  It is not what they are projecting it to be at all.
[01:41:15.113 --> 01:41:32.166]  This physical cliff, so my elite friend has told me, is a part of the debt creation that they wished, and they're using the physical cliff words in order to get into your mind something that they want you to think.
[01:41:32.786 --> 01:41:38.850]  But on the back side of all of this is debt creation that is almost unbelievable.
[01:41:38.850 --> 01:41:42.072]  They did the same thing three times in Europe the last four years.
[01:41:42.072 --> 01:41:44.594]  It's to terrorize you into accepting new taxes.
[01:41:45.612 --> 01:41:47.714]  Exactly right.
[01:41:47.714 --> 01:41:53.358]  Again, please let me express to you, the elite do not want a collapse right now.
[01:41:53.358 --> 01:41:58.142]  And it may not take place for the next two years, it may not take place for the next three years.
[01:41:58.142 --> 01:42:11.612]  It is going to happen within this four year period, but in order to bring in the New World Order the way that they want it, they have got to force, I hope you're catching this word, I didn't say debt creation, I said force
[01:42:15.358 --> 01:42:22.864]  That's why they make you buy health care even though it bankrupts you to go into debt.
[01:42:22.864 --> 01:42:24.986]  They're going to make you do everything.
[01:42:24.986 --> 01:42:29.930]  If they can't make you go on welfare, they're going to make you go under their system one way or the other.
[01:42:30.649 --> 01:42:31.710]  Middle class.
[01:42:31.710 --> 01:42:32.590]  Please.
[01:42:32.590 --> 01:42:36.353]  Oh, goodness, folks, you've got to know what they have planned for you.
[01:42:36.353 --> 01:42:38.014]  The middle class.
[01:42:38.014 --> 01:42:40.076]  Now, all you've heard is about the rich.
[01:42:40.076 --> 01:42:40.776]  Tax the rich.
[01:42:40.776 --> 01:42:41.797]  Tax the rich.
[01:42:41.797 --> 01:42:43.538]  Come on, give me a break.
[01:42:43.538 --> 01:42:46.120]  This is nothing but a smokescreen.
[01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:50.343]  They are going to tax the middle class American into oblivion.
[01:42:50.343 --> 01:42:51.824]  Are you catching this?
[01:42:51.824 --> 01:42:52.664]  Now, watch it.
[01:42:52.664 --> 01:42:54.766]  I don't know what kind of a tax they're going to put on you.
[01:42:55.306 --> 01:42:57.128]  But you won't mock my words.
[01:42:57.128 --> 01:43:11.860]  Before this physical cliff thing is over, you have in front of your eyes one of the most horrifying situations that you've ever imagined in your life because they are only getting your mind ready for a tax.
[01:43:11.860 --> 01:43:13.561]  A number of different taxes.
[01:43:13.561 --> 01:43:16.243]  Number one, you may have a marginal minimum tax.
[01:43:16.243 --> 01:43:17.204]  It's been suggested.
[01:43:17.204 --> 01:43:18.946]  You may have a national sales tax.
[01:43:20.106 --> 01:43:23.587]  You already have an Obamacare tax.
[01:43:23.587 --> 01:43:35.949]  You see, they couldn't say you've got to buy Obamacare, but they could come along and say we're going to tax you for Obamacare, and then this is a part of the debt creation.
[01:43:35.949 --> 01:43:42.730]  3.8 tax on all investments, on pension funds, you name it, and that begins the takeover of those.
[01:43:42.730 --> 01:43:45.211]  That's Washington Post today, that's the Republican proposal.
[01:43:46.798 --> 01:43:50.719]  And then that's seen as the conservative proposal, that's how they bait and switch people.
[01:43:50.719 --> 01:43:54.300]  I'm just backing up what you're saying here.
[01:43:54.300 --> 01:44:05.984]  They're eliminating $600 billion in deductions, $960 billion in tax increases, and all that money, most of that money goes to the mega elite in banker bailouts.
[01:44:05.984 --> 01:44:09.865]  And they're going to tax savings, they're going to tax everything.
[01:44:09.865 --> 01:44:11.886]  I mean, this is just amazing.
[01:44:13.428 --> 01:44:17.773]  You don't pay any attention to this business about tax the rich.
[01:44:17.773 --> 01:44:19.915]  It is a tideline.
[01:44:19.915 --> 01:44:23.960]  You, middle class Americans, you have never seen anything.
[01:44:25.254 --> 01:44:35.301]  All of this is for the purpose of the, and you heard me say a few moments ago that I've already been given a formula as to when you can know that the dollar's going to collapse.
[01:44:35.301 --> 01:44:40.644]  And they're working up to this point of that formula, which I'll give you in a few moments, hopefully I have time to give you.
[01:44:40.644 --> 01:44:42.726]  Okay, let me go back to the middle class.
[01:44:42.726 --> 01:44:44.507]  You heard what Walmart did on yesterday.
[01:44:44.507 --> 01:44:47.189]  Number one retailer in the United States of America.
[01:44:47.789 --> 01:44:59.987]  In the Obamacare program, it says that if any person has under 30 hours of work per week, that they don't fall under the auspices of Walmart having to pay for Obamacare for them.
[01:44:59.987 --> 01:45:02.831]  You folks have killed yourself!
[01:45:03.551 --> 01:45:06.914]  You can't imagine how you should have rebelled against this.
[01:45:06.914 --> 01:45:21.165]  Do you realize that nothing but management personnel of Walmart are going to have jobs of 30 hours and more per week from this point on, and everybody else will be considered part-time help so that they don't have to pay for Obamacare?
[01:45:21.165 --> 01:45:23.487]  But that didn't happen by chance, people!
[01:45:23.487 --> 01:45:25.729]  Oh my goodness, I wish I could get you to see it.
[01:45:26.229 --> 01:45:48.849]  This is happening by design, which I was told three weeks ago by my elite friend, when he told me ten agendas that every American in this country will face, and when Walmart cuts down to 30 hours or less, with all of those thousands and thousands of employees, do you realize that it is going to put every one of them into such massive debt?
[01:45:49.469 --> 01:45:55.112]  They've doubled the food stamps from $25 million to close to $50 million in four years.
[01:45:55.112 --> 01:45:56.633]  This is the domestication.
[01:45:56.633 --> 01:46:00.235]  The sharecropper owe your soul to the company store.
[01:46:00.235 --> 01:46:01.116]  Total takeover.
[01:46:01.116 --> 01:46:02.857]  Get into that formula you were talking about.
[01:46:16.912 --> 01:46:17.953]  Okay, here we go.
[01:46:17.953 --> 01:46:20.594]  Please, I hope you've got pencil and paper there.
[01:46:20.594 --> 01:46:23.775]  And you'll hear it explained in detail in my new DVD series.
[01:46:23.775 --> 01:46:25.516]  Here's the formula.
[01:46:25.516 --> 01:46:45.526]  You remember that when Bernanke announced that the Federal Reserve was going to purchase $40 billion per month of mortgage-backed securities, and of course I came out all over America and told people what was going to happen, but then my elite friend gave me just the other day, and now I can see through it just as plain as day.
[01:46:45.526 --> 01:46:46.066]  What happened?
[01:46:46.824 --> 01:47:01.007]  As of every month, every single month that the Fed buys $40 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities, it automatically devalues the dollar between 3% and 4%.
[01:47:01.007 --> 01:47:01.968]  Did you catch this?
[01:47:01.968 --> 01:47:03.488]  Put it down on your paper.
[01:47:03.488 --> 01:47:05.909]  It automatically devalues the dollar by 3% to 4%.
[01:47:05.909 --> 01:47:06.229]  Now take 4%
[01:47:08.769 --> 01:47:11.330]  And start, come on, use your calculator.
[01:47:11.330 --> 01:47:21.754]  Take that 4% and go every month of the year for 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and then tell me how much money you've got left at the end of the week.
[01:47:21.754 --> 01:47:24.535]  Okay, you must put food on the table.
[01:47:24.535 --> 01:47:28.016]  You positively have to put gas in that gas tank.
[01:47:28.016 --> 01:47:32.178]  And then you're going to have to put clothes on the back of children and food on the table.
[01:47:34.079 --> 01:47:44.573]  At 4% devaluation of the dollar per month, how long is it going to take before the dollar has such a small purchasing power that you can no longer pay the house mortgage?
[01:47:44.573 --> 01:47:45.995]  And this is what they want.
[01:47:45.995 --> 01:47:50.181]  They don't want you to be able to pay that house mortgage because today you can't.
[01:47:50.581 --> 01:47:56.526]  The Federal Reserve, who has already bought that mortgage-backed security, is going to come in and repossess it.
[01:47:56.526 --> 01:48:05.193]  They are the elite who want to bring in the New World Order, and they will own every piece of real estate, mortgage real estate, in the United States of America.
[01:48:05.193 --> 01:48:06.294]  Now, add something onto that.
[01:48:06.294 --> 01:48:06.794]  Come on.
[01:48:06.794 --> 01:48:08.395]  Let's do some math here.
[01:48:08.395 --> 01:48:09.816]  Three to four percent per month.
[01:48:09.816 --> 01:48:11.057]  Automatic devaluation.
[01:48:11.057 --> 01:48:14.140]  So slow that you'll be like a frog crawling in the pot.
[01:48:14.140 --> 01:48:15.061]  You'll accept it.
[01:48:15.061 --> 01:48:16.502]  I hope you don't accept it.
[01:48:16.502 --> 01:48:18.984]  Number two, add the new taxes onto that.
[01:48:19.444 --> 01:48:23.885]  You heard me say, the middle class is going to be taxed into oblivion.
[01:48:23.885 --> 01:48:28.306]  You're going to see either a national sales tax, a module minimum tax.
[01:48:28.306 --> 01:48:30.227]  Obamacare has already come in.
[01:48:30.227 --> 01:48:32.187]  Okay, add something else on to that.
[01:48:32.187 --> 01:48:33.467]  Add on Obamacare.
[01:48:33.467 --> 01:48:34.988]  You haven't had to pay that before.
[01:48:34.988 --> 01:48:36.928]  Okay, see what you've got so far.
[01:48:36.928 --> 01:48:39.369]  You've got 4% per month devaluation.
[01:48:39.369 --> 01:48:46.270]  You've got massive amounts of new tax that you... 4% Obamacare, then you gotta buy the Obama.
[01:48:46.270 --> 01:48:47.491]  It just goes on and on.
[01:48:47.491 --> 01:48:48.731]  You're just adding it all up, yeah.
[01:48:49.352 --> 01:48:51.153]  Yeah, now Obamacare comes in.
[01:48:51.153 --> 01:48:53.435]  That's going to be a new tax, and it is a tax.
[01:48:53.435 --> 01:48:55.556]  The Supreme Court declared it.
[01:48:55.556 --> 01:48:58.238]  Next, put down increased food prices.
[01:48:58.238 --> 01:49:00.159]  You've got to factor these things in.
[01:49:00.159 --> 01:49:10.226]  Then, you take a 30-hour only work week for everybody except the managing personnel of every Walmart, Target,
[01:49:10.886 --> 01:49:19.488]  Every fast food restaurant in the country is going to cut back and have more employees with less than 30 hours of work a week.
[01:49:19.488 --> 01:49:26.789]  And you add that in, the fact that you can't make 40 to 50 hours per week now without having 3 or 4 or 5 jobs.
[01:49:26.789 --> 01:49:33.450]  Then, you've got the Feds, $40 billion per month that the Federal Reserve is going to buy mortgage-backed securities.
[01:49:33.450 --> 01:49:37.091]  You factor in every one of those things and add them up.
[01:49:37.091 --> 01:49:38.551]  Please, you've got to do it.
[01:49:38.551 --> 01:49:39.051]  You must.
[01:49:39.751 --> 01:49:52.546]  And at that point you will know how long it will be before they have created such massive debt in your house that you cannot afford to make the house mortgage payment and that is what they want.
[01:49:54.428 --> 01:49:55.168]  Black Warfare!
[01:49:55.168 --> 01:49:59.890]  We are going into absolute bondage, and everything you're seeing is right here in the Washington Post.
[01:49:59.890 --> 01:50:01.091]  They just released it today.
[01:50:01.091 --> 01:50:11.075]  The Republican plan that's about half the taxes that Obama wants is a devastating $960 billion middle class tax increase.
[01:50:11.075 --> 01:50:12.495]  Elimination of deductions, $600 billion.
[01:50:14.736 --> 01:50:17.759]  Four hundred billion in spending cuts.
[01:50:17.759 --> 01:50:19.141]  And then it just goes on.
[01:50:19.141 --> 01:50:23.065]  Getting rid of all the deductions.
[01:50:23.065 --> 01:50:24.587]  3.8% Obamacare tax.
[01:50:24.587 --> 01:50:26.930]  Not counting having to buy the healthcare.
[01:50:26.930 --> 01:50:29.993]  I mean, this is going to devastate.
[01:50:29.993 --> 01:50:31.114]  You're going to see probably
[01:50:32.376 --> 01:50:35.217]  20, 30, 40% more go on welfare now.
[01:50:35.217 --> 01:50:35.697]  This is it.
[01:50:35.697 --> 01:50:37.478]  They're going to totally collapse this, Lindsey.
[01:50:37.478 --> 01:50:38.238]  How long will it take?
[01:50:38.238 --> 01:50:39.538]  A couple years?
[01:50:39.538 --> 01:50:52.842]  Well, I had been given, and I'm so glad that you just brought up the welfare situation, because when a person only gets 30 hours per week, there's no way in this world that they can afford an apartment, no way they can afford a house, an automobile.
[01:50:52.842 --> 01:50:57.723]  They've cut back, and I was just given how many people... Come on!
[01:50:57.723 --> 01:50:58.564]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:50:58.564 --> 01:50:59.404]  We're going to go there right now.
[01:51:01.192 --> 01:51:06.976]  Sodium fluoride in the body reduces IQ and increases cancers.
[01:51:06.976 --> 01:51:14.342]  Unfortunately, fluoride and its derivatives are only one of hundreds of toxins being added to our drinking water.
[01:51:14.342 --> 01:51:17.084]  We're battling the globalists on so many fronts.
[01:51:17.084 --> 01:51:23.129]  Health is an area where we can all take control of our lives and it all starts with that basic building block of water.
[01:51:23.789 --> 01:51:26.832]  It is time to purify our family's water.
[01:51:26.832 --> 01:51:33.717]  The ProPure filtration system with added fluoride filters is the best system from my research to protect you and your family.
[01:51:33.717 --> 01:51:39.021]  Infowarsstore.com already has the lowest prices on ProPure water filtration.
[01:51:39.021 --> 01:51:44.686]  But until December 10th, we are going to offer 15% off the already lowest price.
[01:51:45.046 --> 01:51:47.367]  I know what I'm giving my family this Christmas.
[01:51:47.367 --> 01:51:48.087]  ProPure.
[01:51:48.087 --> 01:51:54.928]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com and get 15% off the already lowest price out there with the code WATER15.
[01:51:54.928 --> 01:52:00.589]  WATER15 and you get 15% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:52:00.589 --> 01:52:05.350]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:52:05.350 --> 01:52:07.451]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:52:08.380 --> 01:52:17.346]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:52:17.346 --> 01:52:22.269]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:52:22.899 --> 01:52:34.262]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[01:52:34.262 --> 01:52:41.264]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[01:52:41.944 --> 01:52:46.250]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from Carnivora.com.
[01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:49.854]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[01:52:49.854 --> 01:52:54.100]  That's 1-866-836-8735.
[01:52:54.100 --> 01:52:57.124]  1-866-VENUSFLY or visit Carnivora.com.
[01:52:57.124 --> 01:52:58.385]  Protect your immune system.
[01:52:58.385 --> 01:52:59.447]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:52:59.927 --> 01:53:02.850]  You know what happens to your digestive health around the holidays?
[01:53:02.850 --> 01:53:03.451]  Right.
[01:53:03.451 --> 01:53:08.216]  Unusual schedules and foods you don't normally eat can cause upset stomach and indigestion.
[01:53:08.216 --> 01:53:13.662]  But you can prepare your digestive tract with Pro-EM1 Probiotic Cleanse from Terragonics.com.
[01:53:13.662 --> 01:53:17.186]  Pro-EM1 is all natural and made with certified organic ingredients.
[01:53:17.446 --> 01:53:24.431]  It contains no genetically modified ingredients or preservatives and has no animal products, wheat, soy, dairy, or gluten.
[01:53:24.431 --> 01:53:31.015]  Pro-EM1 does not require refrigeration, so you can take it with you over the river and through the woods to Grandma's house.
[01:53:31.015 --> 01:53:36.819]  Pro-EM1 supports a healthy, regular digestive system, supports weight loss, and improves absorption of food nutrients.
[01:53:37.279 --> 01:53:37.679]  By the way,
[01:54:05.874 --> 01:54:10.238]  With the breaks and all of it, we don't have time to go through all ten points.
[01:54:10.238 --> 01:54:16.044]  So Pastor Lindsey Williams will join us an hour commercial-free tomorrow on InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:54:16.044 --> 01:54:16.725]  That is set up.
[01:54:16.725 --> 01:54:25.073]  We'll tape it in the afternoon, it'll air tomorrow night, and I can play some excerpts on the radio on the Friday show or the Thursday show.
[01:54:25.073 --> 01:54:27.215]  But I've got a bunch of calls for you here.
[01:54:27.215 --> 01:54:27.956]  Just mention
[01:54:29.545 --> 01:54:35.666]  Some of the other points you haven't gotten, but to three or four, just quick abbreviations here.
[01:54:35.666 --> 01:54:50.910]  And before I do that, if people want to get the next four years, a new DVD set that just came out today, where you break down your analysis with your source, and how to survive the next four years, two different groups of DVDs at 888-799-6111.
[01:54:50.910 --> 01:54:55.431]  That is prophecyclub.com or lindsaywilliams.net to find that, folks, and we'll talk more about it tomorrow.
[01:54:55.431 --> 01:54:57.151]  But just real fast, just the heading,
[01:54:57.791 --> 01:55:04.425]  Devil's Messiah, the takeover of the churches, they're bankrupting them, making them government organs, totally unconstitutional.
[01:55:04.425 --> 01:55:05.026]  Tell us about that.
[01:55:06.127 --> 01:55:07.769]  Debt limit is going to be suspended.
[01:55:07.769 --> 01:55:09.691]  This is going to be devastating.
[01:55:09.691 --> 01:55:12.333]  Folks, this is part of a debt creation.
[01:55:12.333 --> 01:55:19.680]  Again, the dollar will be phased out over the next four years, very gradually, and you cannot let them do it.
[01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:22.423]  You've got to start some sort of movement before then.
[01:55:22.423 --> 01:55:26.807]  There's new factions I wish to goodness you would know about.
[01:55:26.807 --> 01:55:28.729]  Yeah, cover the factions.
[01:55:28.729 --> 01:55:29.630]  I want to hear that.
[01:55:29.630 --> 01:55:30.351]  Cover the factions.
[01:55:31.575 --> 01:55:32.438]  Uh, I can't.
[01:55:32.438 --> 01:55:35.246]  I can't do it even in 15 to 20 minutes.
[01:55:35.246 --> 01:55:36.831]  I know, but break down some of the factions.
[01:55:37.737 --> 01:55:42.939]  Okay, first of all, there are three factions out there right now, and nobody has the slightest idea about them.
[01:55:42.939 --> 01:55:48.801]  Number one, there is the old-fashioned elite, whom you and I have known for our entire lifetime.
[01:55:48.801 --> 01:55:59.085]  Again, and please bear with me on this, you've got to let me prove it, Obama has double-crossed the elite in his first administration three to four times, and they are livid.
[01:55:59.085 --> 01:56:03.727]  They realize that they have a bull in the china shop right now that is uncontrollable
[01:56:04.307 --> 01:56:10.311]  And since he's back in, they realize that Obama has an agenda, and I've been given some of those agendas.
[01:56:10.311 --> 01:56:13.974]  Again, there is a renegade elite out there right now.
[01:56:13.974 --> 01:56:18.938]  Please, this has never happened before in the history of the existence of the elite.
[01:56:18.938 --> 01:56:20.519]  Let me try to explain some of them.
[01:56:21.119 --> 01:56:23.241]  First of all, there is the BRICS group.
[01:56:23.241 --> 01:56:38.310]  Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, who comprise 43% of the world's population and 18% of the world's GDP and 53% of the global financial capital, and they have said, we're not going to use the American dollar any longer.
[01:56:38.310 --> 01:56:42.453]  They are becoming what the elite are calling a renegade elite.
[01:56:43.133 --> 01:56:47.114]  Yeah, what's happening is they want to control the New World Order.
[01:56:47.114 --> 01:56:48.394]  Okay, and then the third group.
[01:57:09.967 --> 01:57:11.548]  And, well, that is the third group.
[01:57:11.548 --> 01:57:12.749]  There is the elite.
[01:57:12.749 --> 01:57:17.472]  There is an out-of-control president that the elite don't know what they're going to do with him.
[01:57:17.472 --> 01:57:19.213]  They're having problems already.
[01:57:19.213 --> 01:57:26.037]  Then there's a renegade elite comprised of these different groups who have said, we're not going to use the American dollar anymore.
[01:57:26.037 --> 01:57:27.478]  And, folks, let me try to explain it.
[01:57:27.478 --> 01:57:28.339]  Well, that's two.
[01:57:28.339 --> 01:57:30.080]  I mean, there's the old elite.
[01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:32.462]  There's the old elite and the renegade.
[01:57:32.462 --> 01:57:33.842]  What's the third?
[01:57:33.842 --> 01:57:35.183]  Well, there is the elite.
[01:57:35.183 --> 01:57:37.325]  There is the Obama out of control.
[01:57:37.325 --> 01:57:39.126]  And, number three, there's a renegade elite.
[01:57:40.270 --> 01:57:48.576]  Yeah, but Obama's funded by JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs and doing exactly what the megabank Rothschild-Rockefeller power axis, it's now publicly merged.
[01:57:48.576 --> 01:57:50.138]  We always told you that was the power axis.
[01:57:50.138 --> 01:57:52.940]  I mean, he's their complete minion, executing flawlessly.
[01:57:53.612 --> 01:57:55.093]  But he's out of control.
[01:57:55.093 --> 01:58:02.019]  He is doing many things that they didn't want during his last four years, and they realize now that there are many things that he will do this time.
[01:58:02.019 --> 01:58:06.542]  He didn't open up public lands to oil exploration, and they are livid.
[01:58:06.542 --> 01:58:12.027]  He didn't let the pipeline go across Canada in favor of his Muslim Brotherhood friends.
[01:58:12.027 --> 01:58:21.254]  Thirdly, they put in the bill in Congress that controls a lot of the things that the elite do, and it was mentioned by Ron
[01:58:21.374 --> 01:58:22.634]  All right, Lindsey, stay there.
[01:58:22.634 --> 01:58:25.155]  We're going to come back and jam in a few quick questions.
[01:58:25.155 --> 01:58:29.996]  Mark in Colorado is listening on KHNC, 1360 AM.
[01:58:29.996 --> 01:58:31.436]  And we've got a lot of other people there on hold.
[01:58:31.436 --> 01:58:35.897]  I don't know if I'll be able to get to them all because Max Keiser is coming up and I don't want to cut him off.
[01:58:35.897 --> 01:58:41.359]  But man, there is just so much to cover here with Lindsey Williams.
[01:58:41.359 --> 01:58:45.019]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.019 --> 01:58:47.020]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.666 --> 01:58:53.709]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[01:58:53.709 --> 01:58:55.690]  Even save money on your electric bill?
[01:58:55.690 --> 01:58:59.314]  If so, this could be one of the most important messages you will ever hear.
[01:58:59.314 --> 01:59:01.515]  Solar power generators are now available.
[01:59:01.515 --> 01:59:05.179]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power.
[01:59:05.179 --> 01:59:11.244]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[01:59:11.244 --> 01:59:14.627]  It's like having an electrical power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:59:14.947 --> 01:59:19.691]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep your food from spoiling.
[01:59:19.691 --> 01:59:25.676]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:59:25.676 --> 01:59:26.957]  And here's the best news.
[01:59:26.957 --> 01:59:30.119]  A remarkable fall truckload sale is going on right now.
[01:59:30.119 --> 01:59:34.042]  It gets you $1,700 in bonuses when you buy a solar generator.
[01:59:34.042 --> 01:59:38.106]  To find out why these solar generators are the best generators, and get $1,700 in bonuses for doing so,
[01:59:39.867 --> 01:59:41.869]  Go to falltruckloadsale.com.
[01:59:41.869 --> 01:59:43.951]  That's falltruckloadsale.com.
[01:59:43.951 --> 01:59:46.133]  Generate your own supply of electricity.
[01:59:46.133 --> 01:59:48.175]  Go to falltruckloadsale.com.
[01:59:48.175 --> 01:59:53.760]  That's falltruckloadsale.com.
[01:59:53.760 --> 01:59:56.162]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.162 --> 01:59:58.925]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.458 --> 02:00:10.300]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.300 --> 02:00:11.880]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.880 --> 02:00:13.441]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.441 --> 02:00:17.622]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.622 --> 02:00:19.963]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[02:00:20.883 --> 02:00:21.744]  Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.744 --> 02:00:22.705]  Man, this is killing me.
[02:00:22.705 --> 02:00:29.310]  We're almost out of time with Lindsey Williams, but he'll be on with us tomorrow on The Nightly News and a lot of excerpts for him on the radio the next day.
[02:00:29.310 --> 02:00:31.091]  Running through it, Lindsey, gold.
[02:00:31.091 --> 02:00:31.711]  What did they tell you?
[02:00:31.711 --> 02:00:32.992]  Where's gold going?
[02:00:32.992 --> 02:00:36.715]  800 bucks five years ago, four years ago, 1750 now.
[02:00:36.715 --> 02:00:37.516]  Where's gold going?
[02:00:38.206 --> 02:00:39.727]  They have an agenda for gold.
[02:00:39.727 --> 02:00:44.031]  In 2008, at the beginning of the previous administration, gold was $800 an ounce.
[02:00:44.031 --> 02:00:45.112]  Today, gold is approximately $1,700, $1,750.
[02:00:45.112 --> 02:00:46.333]  By 2016, gold is going to $3,000 an ounce.
[02:00:46.333 --> 02:00:46.713]  People, I beg you,
[02:00:56.821 --> 02:01:00.985]  Years ago, to buy the currency of the elite is gold and silver.
[02:01:00.985 --> 02:01:03.527]  I am pleading with you now, and I don't sell it.
[02:01:03.527 --> 02:01:05.848]  You'll have to get it from Alex's sponsor.
[02:01:05.848 --> 02:01:18.599]  Again, 38% of the people in the United States of America are on some sort of a check from the government every month, whether it be Medicare, Medicaid, welfare, food stamps, Social Security.
[02:01:19.319 --> 02:01:20.100]  It's a time bomb.
[02:01:20.100 --> 02:01:22.142]  We gotta go to calls.
[02:01:22.142 --> 02:01:22.722]  Soros?
[02:01:22.722 --> 02:01:23.303]  Incredible.
[02:01:23.303 --> 02:01:24.203]  Real fast.
[02:01:24.203 --> 02:01:27.046]  Let's go to Mark in Colorado, a 1360 listener there in Denver.
[02:01:27.046 --> 02:01:27.986]  Mark, thanks for holding.
[02:01:27.986 --> 02:01:28.447]  Quick question.
[02:01:45.247 --> 02:01:49.950]  Thank you Alex, and real quick for you Alex, double bubble chewing gum.
[02:01:49.950 --> 02:01:54.253]  Not all of their varieties have sugar-free, are sugar.
[02:01:54.253 --> 02:01:56.374]  Thanks a million, we're almost out of time.
[02:01:56.374 --> 02:01:57.535]  You got a question for Lindsey?
[02:01:57.535 --> 02:02:02.278]  What can the average Joe like me, Mr. Williams, do to fight these evil New World Order?
[02:02:02.278 --> 02:02:06.020]  Is there anything at all I can do, sir, to help fight against these evil people?
[02:02:06.678 --> 02:02:07.238]  Yes.
[02:02:07.238 --> 02:02:10.699]  There is a multitude of things you can do, and I can't give them in two minutes.
[02:02:10.699 --> 02:02:18.200]  Get prepared, get right with God, learn how to be self-sufficient, and get some good friends.
[02:02:18.200 --> 02:02:18.880]  Done all that.
[02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:19.960]  How about you, Mr. Williams?
[02:02:19.960 --> 02:02:22.001]  What do you say, sir?
[02:02:22.001 --> 02:02:26.301]  You definitely have got to know how to be prepared, yeah.
[02:02:26.301 --> 02:02:29.482]  And it includes a whole lot more than just food and water.
[02:02:29.482 --> 02:02:35.823]  You're going to have to make preparations as far as your personal... You know, I just don't know how to give this in a moment's time.
[02:02:36.741 --> 02:02:38.522]  Yeah, that's why I answered the question for him, sir.
[02:02:38.522 --> 02:02:39.723]  I appreciate the call.
[02:02:39.723 --> 02:02:41.303]  David in Wisconsin, you're on the air.
[02:02:41.303 --> 02:02:42.464]  Quick question.
[02:02:42.464 --> 02:02:43.684]  Thank you.
[02:02:43.684 --> 02:02:47.326]  Gentlemen are really bringing up a lot of questions with our financial solvency right now.
[02:02:47.326 --> 02:02:48.967]  You're starting to answer the question that I have.
[02:02:48.967 --> 02:02:49.708]  Can you hear me?
[02:02:49.708 --> 02:02:50.268]  Yes, sir.
[02:02:50.268 --> 02:02:51.208]  Yes.
[02:02:51.208 --> 02:02:54.050]  I'm carrying this on the newsunit.com, also your transmissions.
[02:02:54.050 --> 02:03:00.073]  And what my question is, is regarding the big topic of gold and silver, which you're just sort of getting into here.
[02:03:00.073 --> 02:03:04.535]  And we're watching it kind of go off the fiscal cliff right now on the charts as it's diving down today.
[02:03:05.222 --> 02:03:13.209]  Does Lindsey think that they're going to try to manipulate that price lower so that the elite can get in and buy these sort of protecting type assets?
[02:03:13.209 --> 02:03:16.471]  You know, the same thing that we should be doing here as the middle class.
[02:03:16.471 --> 02:03:25.439]  Does he think that they're going to be manipulating these prices so that they can in fact take advantage of this fiscal cliff and in turn also get profits from this financial cliff?
[02:03:25.439 --> 02:03:27.560]  Do bears live in the woods?
[02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:28.922]  Thank you for the great question, Lindsey.
[02:03:29.833 --> 02:03:30.874]  Yes.
[02:03:30.874 --> 02:03:34.156]  Don't pay any attention to the fact that it goes up and down from time to time.
[02:03:34.156 --> 02:03:36.737]  They want to scare the average person out of it.
[02:03:36.737 --> 02:03:38.778]  But, I've been given the figure.
[02:03:38.778 --> 02:03:42.720]  In 2016, you will have it up to $3,000.
[02:03:42.720 --> 02:03:45.262]  So don't pay any attention to some drops.
[02:03:45.262 --> 02:03:48.224]  Take advantage of them and get in when you can.
[02:03:48.224 --> 02:03:49.644]  Alright, one more call here.
[02:03:49.644 --> 02:03:50.805]  Moving quickly, or maybe two.
[02:03:50.805 --> 02:03:52.006]  Matt in Kansas, quick question.
[02:03:53.809 --> 02:04:01.249]  Yeah, Lindsey, I was wanting to know if your elite contact is giving you any indications on what they fear as far as the People's Movement.
[02:04:02.578 --> 02:04:06.440]  Yes, they're very concerned about an out-of-control president.
[02:04:06.440 --> 02:04:09.341]  Now please, bear with me, I'm just giving you what they're telling me.
[02:04:09.341 --> 02:04:28.250]  You can't imagine the emails I've received from my elite friend talking about how the elite themselves, especially the old-time elite, are concerned about a president that is haughty, arrogant, thinks he has the tiger by the tail right now, and is like a bull in a china shop, completely out of control, and even they don't know what to do with him in some instances.
[02:04:30.970 --> 02:04:32.691]  But what do they fear from the people?
[02:04:32.691 --> 02:04:37.492]  I mean, you said it last time, us getting organized and angry, right?
[02:04:37.492 --> 02:04:42.534]  The last thing in the world that they want is civil war.
[02:04:42.534 --> 02:04:44.975]  The last thing they want is civil uprisings.
[02:04:44.975 --> 02:04:47.635]  They want to bring in the new world order according to their plan.
[02:04:47.635 --> 02:04:51.096]  They may not be able to do it, but yet on the other hand, that's what they want.
[02:04:51.096 --> 02:04:55.398]  Yeah, that's why they don't like Obama, because he's so communist and hates guns so much.
[02:04:55.398 --> 02:04:57.198]  He may start a civil war trying to get the guns.
[02:04:57.198 --> 02:04:58.699]  Lindsey, we're going to talk to you tomorrow.
[02:05:01.710 --> 02:05:08.474]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[02:05:08.474 --> 02:05:15.219]  At Silverlungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.
[02:05:15.219 --> 02:05:26.186]  Our most popular silver-based products are the 32-ounce NanoSilver solutions, our 2-ounce NanoSilver nasal applicators, as well as our all-natural silver soaps.
[02:05:26.186 --> 02:05:27.807]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[02:05:30.288 --> 02:05:37.232]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[02:05:37.232 --> 02:05:48.499]  But rather we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.
[02:05:48.499 --> 02:05:56.084]  Visit www.silverlungs.com and click on our store page to find what silver based products are best for you.
[02:05:57.250 --> 02:06:01.332]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:06:01.332 --> 02:06:07.115]  Sodium fluoride in the body reduces IQ and increases cancers.
[02:06:07.115 --> 02:06:14.478]  Unfortunately, fluoride and its derivatives are only one of hundreds of toxins being added to our drinking water.
[02:06:14.478 --> 02:06:17.200]  We're battling the globalist on so many fronts.
[02:06:17.200 --> 02:06:23.263]  Health is an area where we can all take control of our lives, and it all starts with that basic building block of water.
[02:06:23.923 --> 02:06:26.966]  It is time to purify our family's water.
[02:06:26.966 --> 02:06:33.852]  The ProPure filtration system with added fluoride filters is the best system for my research to protect you and your family.
[02:06:33.852 --> 02:06:39.157]  Infowarstore.com already has the lowest prices on ProPure water filtration.
[02:06:39.157 --> 02:06:44.823]  But until December 10th, we are going to offer 15% off the already lowest price.
[02:06:45.183 --> 02:06:47.507]  I know what I'm giving my family this Christmas.
[02:06:47.507 --> 02:06:48.228]  ProPure.
[02:06:48.228 --> 02:06:54.236]  Go to InfowarStore.com and get 15% off the already lowest price out there with the code WATER15.
[02:06:54.236 --> 02:06:56.540]  WATER15 and you get 15% off at InfowarStore.com.
[02:07:00.686 --> 02:07:03.728]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:07:03.728 --> 02:07:05.710]  Even save money on your electric bill?
[02:07:05.710 --> 02:07:09.332]  If so, this could be one of the most important messages you will ever hear.
[02:07:09.332 --> 02:07:11.534]  Solar power generators are now available.
[02:07:11.534 --> 02:07:15.177]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power.
[02:07:15.177 --> 02:07:21.261]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[02:07:21.261 --> 02:07:24.644]  It's like having an electrical power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:07:24.964 --> 02:07:29.708]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep your food from spoiling.
[02:07:29.708 --> 02:07:35.692]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:07:35.692 --> 02:07:36.973]  And here's the best news.
[02:07:36.973 --> 02:07:44.058]  A remarkable fall truckload sale is going on right now that gets you $1,700 in bonuses when you buy a solar generator.
[02:07:44.058 --> 02:07:48.121]  To find out why these solar generators are the best generators and get $1,700 in bonuses for doing so,
[02:07:49.882 --> 02:07:51.883]  Go to FallTruckLoadSale.com.
[02:07:51.883 --> 02:07:53.963]  That's FallTruckLoadSale.com.
[02:07:53.963 --> 02:07:56.144]  Generate your own supply of electricity.
[02:07:56.144 --> 02:07:58.185]  Go to FallTruckLoadSale.com.
[02:07:58.185 --> 02:08:03.447]  That's FallTruckLoadSale.com.
[02:08:03.447 --> 02:08:12.970]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[02:08:12.970 --> 02:08:14.530]  Thomas Jefferson.
[02:08:14.530 --> 02:08:18.172]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:21.621 --> 02:08:36.777]  Well, Fox Sports columnist that we covered in the first hour has come out and said you are a member of the KKK if you're in the NRA or a gun owner and has called for the ban of firearms for the American people.
[02:08:37.438 --> 02:08:48.247]  Bob Costas, as you know, then went and quoted him and said he, quote, agreed with everything that he had said and then read it word for word off of a teleprompter.
[02:08:48.247 --> 02:08:57.235]  All of that news is up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com with the video and the audio of all of it.
[02:08:57.235 --> 02:09:03.400]  And the establishment thinks you're so dumb that the Republicans have come out with
[02:09:05.961 --> 02:09:22.630]  960 billion in tax increases on the middle class, 600 billion in deduction of the deductions, and the Obamacare 3.8% tax on investments.
[02:09:22.630 --> 02:09:24.151]  Investments, and that means your 401K.
[02:09:27.053 --> 02:09:28.315]  Unbelievable.
[02:09:28.315 --> 02:09:29.936]  And that's being called conservative.
[02:09:29.936 --> 02:09:31.077]  That's the compromise.
[02:09:31.077 --> 02:09:37.842]  Obama wants dictatorial power to have Congress just shine away the power of the purse to him, when he's already operating like that on so many fronts.
[02:09:37.842 --> 02:09:39.864]  They're all just complete fronts.
[02:09:39.864 --> 02:09:45.829]  And here is Max Keiser with his big front page and the mighty London Independent.
[02:09:45.829 --> 02:09:48.131]  Max Keiser, Barack Obama is clueless.
[02:09:48.131 --> 02:09:51.113]  Mitt Romney will bankrupt the country.
[02:09:52.088 --> 02:10:02.591]  And that's exactly what he actually said back in November, and he wants to talk some about this article, but he obviously predicted that Obama would be the winner.
[02:10:02.591 --> 02:10:06.372]  But I mean, to say that Obama is clueless, I mean, we know Max.
[02:10:06.372 --> 02:10:10.354]  Max doesn't really believe that, and that's Robert Chambers.
[02:10:12.566 --> 02:10:14.247]  Or Calmers saying that.
[02:10:14.247 --> 02:10:25.932]  So we're going to get a former, well now retired, stockbroker, top stockbroker, inventor of the Hollywood Stock Exchange, virtual trading specialist, he used a lot of stock markets in the world today, really needs no introduction here.
[02:10:25.932 --> 02:10:27.492]  But so much is going on.
[02:10:27.492 --> 02:10:37.977]  Here's an interesting one, McClatchy Newspapers, I just can't get over this, headline, Al-Qaeda link group Syrian rebels once denied, now key to anti-Assad victories.
[02:10:38.877 --> 02:10:46.625]  And they admit our government's giving service-to-air missiles to Al-Qaeda, that they're the groups making people suicide bomb, or they kill their families.
[02:10:46.625 --> 02:10:49.128]  And this is the height of morality now.
[02:10:49.128 --> 02:10:51.750]  But I've got to get my rights up or Al-Qaeda will kill me.
[02:10:51.750 --> 02:10:52.691]  And here's some of the other news.
[02:10:52.691 --> 02:10:56.435]  TSA seeks permission to conduct safety assessments on highways.
[02:10:56.435 --> 02:11:01.740]  TSA is creating and maintaining a watch list of Americans who violate its policies, breaking
[02:11:03.102 --> 02:11:06.805]  The whole Trayvon Martin situation now with the bloodied photos.
[02:11:06.805 --> 02:11:08.466]  Why did the media cover that up and the government?
[02:11:08.466 --> 02:11:11.569]  Because they want to get racial division in this country.
[02:11:11.569 --> 02:11:13.110]  That is just some of what we've got.
[02:11:13.110 --> 02:11:20.637]  And then dealing with the financial fiscal cliff that Max Keiser has been talking about.
[02:11:20.637 --> 02:11:23.839]  Earlier I read the headlines out of England.
[02:11:23.839 --> 02:11:27.603]  I'm looking for that article right now, where the Bank of England had said this is like
[02:11:28.343 --> 02:11:29.964]  A world war.
[02:11:29.964 --> 02:11:34.488]  It is so bad and basically said there's no way to pay things off.
[02:11:34.488 --> 02:11:34.908]  Here it is.
[02:11:34.908 --> 02:11:35.488]  I actually found it.
[02:11:35.488 --> 02:11:39.351]  We can document cam shot this for TV viewers.
[02:11:39.351 --> 02:11:41.693]  This is as bad as a world war.
[02:11:41.693 --> 02:11:50.179]  Bank of England bosses grim view of financial crisis, which has left a debt that will be paid by our grandchildren.
[02:11:50.179 --> 02:11:51.380]  It's not meant to be paid.
[02:11:51.380 --> 02:11:52.120]  It's mega banks
[02:11:52.961 --> 02:11:57.065]  Putting out derivatives that we then back up with the Federal Reserve.
[02:11:57.065 --> 02:11:57.925]  Europe's doing the same thing.
[02:11:57.925 --> 02:12:05.172]  $40 billion a month paid directly to the private shareholders of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and others.
[02:12:05.172 --> 02:12:11.677]  And now we're hearing the head of JPMorgan Chase, who ran disgusting ads during football,
[02:12:12.933 --> 02:12:13.473]  I don't
[02:12:34.588 --> 02:12:37.770]  Max Keiser, where on earth are we going?
[02:12:37.770 --> 02:12:48.616]  Break down the points I've made because you've said that you believe by April, that's now only three or four months away, that it's going to be clear that we're in a full bore collapse.
[02:12:48.616 --> 02:12:51.138]  What is your overall take since you were on a month ago?
[02:12:52.142 --> 02:12:56.326]  Oh yeah, five months away to April.
[02:12:56.326 --> 02:13:04.653]  Holding to my prediction, Alex Jones, that you will have a catastrophic event.
[02:13:04.653 --> 02:13:07.235]  And the question was, what would be the trigger?
[02:13:07.235 --> 02:13:10.979]  You know, on this show, your show, we talk about the potential trigger points.
[02:13:11.799 --> 02:13:40.795]  And one that I mentioned a couple of months ago which is now on the radar of a lot of people is in Japan because Japan has the worst debt situation in the world and they're bringing in a new government in a couple of weeks who has publicly stated that he wants to bring in a quadrillion in yen printing and he wants to kill the Japanese yen which would possibly be the first of the G7 nations to enter into a hyperinflationary currency collapse.
[02:13:41.615 --> 02:13:45.298]  So, that's kind of where I'm putting my chips right now.
[02:13:45.298 --> 02:13:53.823]  I think the global currency collapse could start in Japan, and I'm sticking to my timeline of the next five months.
[02:13:53.823 --> 02:13:59.347]  I want to point your attention, direct your attention to something that just came out a couple of weeks, a couple of days ago.
[02:13:59.347 --> 02:14:00.188]  In Switzerland now,
[02:14:01.129 --> 02:14:03.070]  They've introduced negative interest rates.
[02:14:03.070 --> 02:14:09.195]  This is something I predicted on your show and a couple of others I predicted a year ago or so.
[02:14:09.195 --> 02:14:15.420]  And so if you keep your money in a Swiss bank, they charge you to keep your money in a Swiss bank.
[02:14:15.420 --> 02:14:17.121]  It's a negative interest rate.
[02:14:17.741 --> 02:14:20.303]  This is a form of a capital control.
[02:14:20.303 --> 02:14:22.904]  They don't want people putting their money into Switzerland.
[02:14:22.904 --> 02:14:37.293]  So if you're trying to escape, let's say you're a Japanese yen investor and you're trying to escape the yen and you want to put your money in Switzerland, the Swiss government will charge you to keep your money in a Swiss money market or cash account.
[02:14:37.893 --> 02:14:50.298]  And right now, there are six countries in Europe that charge negative interest rates, with Switzerland charging a negative up to a half a percentage point to a point on two-year paper, and there's five other countries that offer negative interest rates.
[02:14:50.298 --> 02:14:59.682]  So, this idea of putting your money someplace where it's going to be safe, well, these countries have figured this out, and they're charging you to keep your money in the bank.
[02:14:59.682 --> 02:15:06.785]  So, not only do you have inflation to deal with, but you have the fact that the banks are now openly confiscating your money
[02:15:07.225 --> 02:15:09.566]  Using negative interest rates.
[02:15:09.566 --> 02:15:16.109]  This, of course, will come to the United States soon enough and so it'll come to the UK as well.
[02:15:16.109 --> 02:15:22.012]  So here's another big story from Just Breaking, which is part of what we talked about on your show before.
[02:15:22.472 --> 02:15:39.382]  You know, Corrections Corps of America, the company that is the biggest private prison operator in America, the company that just did a deal with 48 states in America saying that we'll take your prison business from you and we'll run your prisons if you guarantee 98% occupancy.
[02:15:39.382 --> 02:15:41.544]  That is to say, you put people in prison.
[02:15:41.544 --> 02:15:46.867]  Well, it just came out that Corrections Corps of America is using gangs to run their prisons.
[02:15:47.810 --> 02:15:54.973]  So this is like a gang Ponzi scheme, where the gangs run the prisons to go out to go and put more gangs in prison to run the prisons.
[02:15:54.973 --> 02:16:07.899]  And then they rotate them out back on the street to be protected by the police, the certain groups to run the drugs, to launder it back through the megabanks publicly who've been caught and don't get in trouble, who then own the subsidiary private prisons.
[02:16:07.899 --> 02:16:10.761]  So it's an absolute full-spectrum dominance program.
[02:16:11.383 --> 02:16:26.968]  And you can buy stock in Craxton's Corp of America and, you know, the elites that Lindsay Williams talks about, I mean, they buy stock in Craxton's Corp of America, so they, it's like buying stock on a plantation from Antebellum South if you wanted to buy, or buying stock in Auschwitz.
[02:16:26.968 --> 02:16:28.128]  Hey, wouldn't that be a great idea?
[02:16:28.128 --> 02:16:29.449]  You could buy stock in Auschwitz.
[02:16:29.449 --> 02:16:33.330]  Of course, I'm sure if Goldman Sachs had an opportunity, they would take Auschwitz public with them.
[02:16:33.370 --> 02:16:45.459]  Well, actually, a lot of the megabanks did fund Hitler, as you know, and then people like my grandfather, they weren't allowed to bomb whole sectors that had Ford and GM factories and slave camps.
[02:16:45.459 --> 02:16:47.541]  So, because the war was a huge profit on both sides.
[02:16:48.271 --> 02:16:53.117]  And let's take a look at the global debt situation since we were on last.
[02:16:53.117 --> 02:17:00.745]  The G7 countries, they've moved from being having a debt to GDP of 375% a debt to GDP ratio is now at 415% debt to GDP ratio.
[02:17:04.789 --> 02:17:11.691]  And here's really the story and the methodology and the psychosis.
[02:17:11.691 --> 02:17:20.274]  Ben Bernanke talks about deflation, and he therefore jacks interest rates down to near 0%.
[02:17:20.274 --> 02:17:25.096]  In fact, by putting interest rates near 0%, he causes deflation.
[02:17:25.396 --> 02:17:32.622]  He causes now the insurance industry has stated that because interest rates are so low, they can no longer operate as insurance companies.
[02:17:32.622 --> 02:17:34.683]  So if you don't have insurance, you don't have private property.
[02:17:34.683 --> 02:17:37.065]  If you don't have private property, you don't have capitalism.
[02:17:37.065 --> 02:17:41.068]  So the insurance industry is now saying we can't operate with this low interest rate environment.
[02:17:41.068 --> 02:17:42.569]  So that's a form of deflation.
[02:17:42.569 --> 02:17:45.251]  The wages are getting completely scrubbed.
[02:17:45.251 --> 02:17:46.592]  There hasn't been any wage growth in years.
[02:17:46.592 --> 02:17:47.553]  That's a form of deflation.
[02:17:47.913 --> 02:17:55.079]  And so Bernanke says we're going to lower interest rates to fight deflation, but in fact by lowering interest rates, he's guaranteeing deflation.
[02:17:55.079 --> 02:18:02.405]  At the same time, he is creating, and this is a remarkable statistic, the bond market in America
[02:18:03.186 --> 02:18:06.290]  Is that a 240-year high?
[02:18:06.290 --> 02:18:11.735]  The bond market in the United Kingdom is at a 300-year high.
[02:18:11.735 --> 02:18:19.964]  Never have bonds in 300 years in this country, United Kingdom, have been higher than they are now, or in 240 years in America than they are right now.
[02:18:19.964 --> 02:18:21.566]  That is a classic bubble.
[02:18:21.566 --> 02:18:25.090]  When people say, well, what about this idea that interest rates are going to go higher?
[02:18:25.290 --> 02:18:46.983]  Interest rates will go higher when this bond bubble collapses, and this is part of what I'm saying in the next five months, the trigger that will create the cascade, the domino effect, probably starting in Japan, toward a global sovereign bond collapse, which means interest rates, which are the inverse of a bond price, go up dramatically, and that's your... Why is the Bank of England head saying this is Armageddon?
[02:18:48.510 --> 02:18:51.532]  Well, he's now leaving.
[02:18:51.532 --> 02:18:52.793]  Mervyn King is on the way out.
[02:18:52.793 --> 02:18:54.695]  They're bringing this Canadian in.
[02:18:54.695 --> 02:18:57.237]  Here's a perfect example of what you talk about, the New World Order.
[02:18:57.237 --> 02:19:07.825]  The fact that you can just plug and play and take a Canadian central banker and stick it into a British institution, the Bank of England, without anyone questioning, well, who are they answering to?
[02:19:07.825 --> 02:19:10.448]  They're not answering to the sovereign in which they work.
[02:19:10.448 --> 02:19:13.190]  They're answering to a global banking establishment.
[02:19:13.750 --> 02:19:21.337]  If you can just take the Canadian central banker and put him into London, then who's going to fill the Canadian central bank?
[02:19:21.337 --> 02:19:24.860]  That'll probably be somebody from the global banking establishment.
[02:19:24.860 --> 02:19:27.823]  That's like Ireland, it's like Greece, it's like Italy.
[02:19:27.823 --> 02:19:38.573]  They just appoint not just the bankers, but the presidents and prime ministers now, and then brag we're in a world government in hundreds of newspapers, but then have the Southern Broadway Law Center say you're a terrorist if you talk about it.
[02:19:39.353 --> 02:19:46.355]  Uh, and they tell the police and training manuals none of it exists, and the cops are like the general public, don't even know how to tie their shoelaces, they believe it.
[02:19:46.355 --> 02:19:52.316]  I mean, it is, and the government runs Al-Qaeda publicly, and I've got to give my rights up.
[02:19:52.316 --> 02:19:56.337]  If I'm downtown shooting video, cops come over and say, you can't videotape, you might be Al-Qaeda.
[02:19:56.337 --> 02:20:00.438]  Well, the government runs Al-Qaeda, and the cop doesn't even know what continent he's on.
[02:20:00.438 --> 02:20:00.818]  We'll be back.
[02:20:01.178 --> 02:20:02.179]  Hi there.
[02:20:02.179 --> 02:20:03.700]  My name is Frank Bates.
[02:20:03.700 --> 02:20:07.562]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[02:20:07.562 --> 02:20:16.708]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[02:20:16.708 --> 02:20:23.413]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[02:20:23.413 --> 02:20:25.614]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[02:20:25.614 --> 02:20:30.698]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[02:20:31.458 --> 02:20:39.403]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[02:20:39.403 --> 02:20:44.986]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.

[02:21:02.602 --> 02:21:14.112]  You land in Buenos Aires, then a shuttle to Santa Rosa, where a nicely furnished cabin with all amenities, Wi-Fi, executive food and wine, and laundry service awaits.

[02:21:17.555 --> 02:21:20.998]  You're on a golden stag safari for big game.
[02:21:21.958 --> 02:21:23.279]  But it's not Africa.
[02:21:23.279 --> 02:21:24.839]  It's Argentina.
[02:21:24.839 --> 02:21:33.623]  One-on-one guided hunts for water buffalo, cougar, bighorn rams, wild boar, and the biggest stag deer in South America.

[02:21:54.818 --> 02:21:56.900]  The big game hunting ranch.

[02:22:29.978 --> 02:22:31.219]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:31.219 --> 02:22:35.782]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:35.782 --> 02:22:41.606]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:41.606 --> 02:22:45.248]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[02:23:04.940 --> 02:23:09.281]  Hi, I'm Pastor Jenny, and that was the state I was in back in 2010.
[02:23:09.281 --> 02:23:11.462]  Then I learned about RNA drops.
[02:23:11.462 --> 02:23:21.145]  I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have called junk is actually packed with millions of gene switches that play a critical role in controlling how my cells, organs,
[02:23:21.485 --> 02:23:21.565]  Yeah!
[02:23:41.829 --> 02:23:48.897]  That's rnafreesample.com or call toll-free 888-577-3703.

[02:24:07.569 --> 02:24:18.195]  So Whitlock of Fox Sports says if you own a gun or remember the NRA, you are a KKK racist, period.
[02:24:18.195 --> 02:24:24.378]  Bob Costas picks up his column and agrees that handguns should basically be banned and guns are causing crime.
[02:24:26.030 --> 02:24:32.575]  And now Piers Morgan, we were just talking about foreigners being sent to run England, foreigners being sent to run other countries.
[02:24:32.575 --> 02:24:33.855]  That's the New World Order.
[02:24:33.855 --> 02:24:38.198]  Piers Morgan has called for a ban of all semi-autos on CNN.
[02:24:38.198 --> 02:24:40.040]  CNN anchor rants about gun control.
[02:24:41.013 --> 02:24:42.654]  So there you go.
[02:24:42.654 --> 02:24:48.997]  I mean, you know, and again, it's amazing that this is what we live under.
[02:24:48.997 --> 02:24:52.439]  That's up at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:24:52.439 --> 02:24:53.519]  Long segment coming up.
[02:24:53.519 --> 02:24:57.842]  We're going to air a special report on the Second Amendment that Aaron and I put together and then go back to Max.
[02:24:58.822 --> 02:25:07.907]  Here with us, and I'm excited to announce that Max is going to start doing 10-minute special reports for InfoWars Nightly News once a week, as well as joining us a few times a month.
[02:25:07.907 --> 02:25:15.551]  We're very honored to have him do that, and I should add that you should follow him at Twitter and also MaxKaiser.com.
[02:25:15.551 --> 02:25:18.372]  And we're going to put it up on screen, Max.
[02:25:18.372 --> 02:25:20.073]  It's at Max Kaiser.
[02:25:20.073 --> 02:25:22.934]  Very, very simple to follow you at Twitter.
[02:25:22.934 --> 02:25:27.257]  And I'm real Alex Jones, and I've got a at prison planet, but I don't know why I don't have a at
[02:25:28.197 --> 02:25:28.997]  Real Alex Jones.
[02:25:28.997 --> 02:25:30.338]  We'll figure that out.
[02:25:30.338 --> 02:25:33.519]  But at Max Keiser, everybody should follow him there for all the updates.
[02:25:33.519 --> 02:25:37.420]  And I hope you're wrong, but I do see massive preparations for this.
[02:25:37.420 --> 02:25:38.480]  And look at this.
[02:25:38.480 --> 02:25:40.021]  Cops to Congress.
[02:25:40.021 --> 02:25:42.742]  We need logs of Americans' text messages.
[02:25:42.742 --> 02:25:43.522]  CNET News.
[02:25:43.522 --> 02:25:44.842]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[02:25:44.842 --> 02:25:49.244]  Feds telling states to pass laws allowing highway checkpoints.
[02:25:50.064 --> 02:25:54.066]  TSA announces highway checkpoints in all 50 states.
[02:25:54.066 --> 02:25:59.307]  They're announcing capital controls that you won't be able to leave the country now if they say you owe money.
[02:25:59.307 --> 02:26:03.169]  I mean, this is becoming Nazi Germany, Max Keiser.
[02:26:03.169 --> 02:26:04.729]  Well, it's not the capital controls.
[02:26:04.729 --> 02:26:06.070]  It's not just even trying to leave.
[02:26:07.994 --> 02:26:12.796]  The central banks don't trust each other.
[02:26:12.796 --> 02:26:18.838]  That's why the lending is not being made.
[02:26:18.838 --> 02:26:35.323]  A lot of people are complaining that the banks are not lending enough to stimulate business because the banks are hoarding cash and they're hoarding cash because they don't trust each other because they know that a credit freeze like in 2008 or a collapse as I'm predicting will come
[02:26:35.943 --> 02:26:40.105]  They need that money on hand to pay themselves, basically.
[02:26:40.105 --> 02:26:41.886]  And they don't trust each other.
[02:26:41.886 --> 02:26:46.628]  This is another reason why, since 2009, the central banks have been buying gold.
[02:26:46.628 --> 02:26:48.949]  This year, they're going to be buying over 500 tons of gold.
[02:26:48.949 --> 02:26:50.589]  That's just the central banks.
[02:26:50.589 --> 02:27:04.135]  Also, starting next year, Alex, the Basel Agreement will classify gold for banks as a Tier 1 asset, which means that you can borrow 100 cents on the dollar against gold that you
[02:27:04.575 --> 02:27:09.440]  So another big buyer of gold in 2013 will be banks.
[02:27:09.440 --> 02:27:16.808]  And China's doing it, universities are doing it, Soros is doing it while simultaneously badmouthing it.
[02:27:16.808 --> 02:27:21.452]  I mean a lot of this for me signals a bull market in gold.
[02:27:22.173 --> 02:27:27.934]  Well, China is due to surprise everybody when they announced their official reserve figures.
[02:27:27.934 --> 02:27:35.036]  They officially have 1,051 tons, but now it's pretty much an open secret that they have at least 3,000 tons.
[02:27:35.036 --> 02:27:38.937]  They're the biggest gold producer in the world, the biggest gold miner in the world.
[02:27:38.937 --> 02:27:40.617]  None of the gold leaves China.
[02:27:40.617 --> 02:27:50.439]  There was a report that came out a couple of weeks ago proving or suggesting or indicating that no gold bar circulating in the vault of any of the banks around the world have any Chinese
[02:27:56.781 --> 02:28:03.426]  They want to get enough gold in-house to give them protection against that huge reserve of dollars that they have.
[02:28:03.426 --> 02:28:07.168]  They have three trillion paper money reserves, over a trillion of that.
[02:28:07.168 --> 02:28:10.711]  They're massively hedging with gold, and who else is doing that?
[02:28:10.711 --> 02:28:12.192]  Basically everybody.
[02:28:12.192 --> 02:28:16.955]  Well, Mexico has increased their gold position by thousands of percentage points.
[02:28:16.955 --> 02:28:18.436]  Korea's been buying gold.
[02:28:18.436 --> 02:28:19.617]  Every central bank in the world
[02:28:20.385 --> 02:28:23.528]  No, I make that, no.
[02:28:23.528 --> 02:28:27.012]  Many of the central banks in the world are buying gold.
[02:28:27.012 --> 02:28:31.777]  Some are famously not buying gold, like the Bank of England sold... What about all the fake tungsten?
[02:28:31.777 --> 02:28:33.558]  I heard you talking about that five years ago.
[02:28:33.558 --> 02:28:38.283]  It's surfacing in vaults and government and private central banks everywhere.
[02:28:38.283 --> 02:28:42.647]  Well, when the paper money collapses, you know, tungsten's not that bad a thing to have.
[02:28:44.281 --> 02:28:50.307]  You know, I mean, anything that's not paper is going to be valuable against a paper money apocalypse that's coming.
[02:28:50.307 --> 02:28:55.271]  But the tungsten has been an issue for years and years.
[02:28:55.271 --> 02:28:58.434]  I mean, it's one of the... another concern.
[02:28:58.434 --> 02:29:05.121]  I mean, you need to keep your head up and make sure you don't... Sure, my point is the gold-covered tungsten is surfacing everywhere.
[02:29:07.595 --> 02:29:14.404]  The big gold market, it's not enough of an issue to alter these big trends that we're seeing.
[02:29:14.404 --> 02:29:15.406]  No, no, I understand.
[02:29:15.406 --> 02:29:21.834]  I'm just saying that shows that these western banks don't have as much gold as they said they have.
[02:29:22.711 --> 02:29:25.713]  Well, the bigger problem is that they've leased it out.
[02:29:25.713 --> 02:29:33.218]  This is why a lot of the gold in Central Bank's vaults that they've leased out, now there's a big question mark whether that gold is actually there.
[02:29:33.218 --> 02:29:42.725]  Now, to contrast this with what we saw in the United States a couple of weeks ago, when it was thought that... Okay, Max, we're going to break.
[02:29:42.725 --> 02:29:44.306]  Your mic's distorting just a tad.
[02:29:44.306 --> 02:29:45.407]  You may want to back off a little bit.
[02:29:45.407 --> 02:29:49.150]  We're going to have a special report on guns and the attack on them, and then back to Max Keiser.
[02:29:50.339 --> 02:29:53.342]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.342 --> 02:29:56.926]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.287 --> 02:30:07.870]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[02:30:07.870 --> 02:30:11.112]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[02:30:11.112 --> 02:30:13.934]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[02:30:13.934 --> 02:30:16.935]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[02:30:16.935 --> 02:30:20.458]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[02:30:20.458 --> 02:30:25.661]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[02:30:25.661 --> 02:30:28.342]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.

[02:30:31.964 --> 02:30:34.085]  I'm taking control of my future.
[02:30:34.085 --> 02:30:35.726]  And you're nuts if you don't do the same.

[02:33:10.120 --> 02:33:15.210]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, waging war on corruption.
[02:33:15.210 --> 02:33:19.639]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:33:22.148 --> 02:33:32.715]  Bob Costas has responded to my call that he be fired if he does not apologize, and obviously others have been calling for that as well.
[02:33:32.715 --> 02:33:38.978]  He put out one clarification last night that basically said we were too stupid to understand what he was saying, so another slap in the face.
[02:33:38.978 --> 02:33:41.500]  We have a video about that up on InfoWars.com.
[02:33:41.500 --> 02:33:48.004]  We're about to premiere a detailed analysis of this, and then go back to Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com.
[02:33:48.004 --> 02:33:48.825]  He then went on
[02:33:49.725 --> 02:34:03.145]  And a new USA Today that has a transcript of here on the Dan Patrick Show today, this morning, saying that sometimes the quality of those who oppose you speaks for itself.
[02:34:03.991 --> 02:34:06.592]  And then he wanted to talk about racist.
[02:34:06.592 --> 02:34:07.813]  So now everything's racist.
[02:34:07.813 --> 02:34:10.013]  If you don't, you just say racist.
[02:34:10.013 --> 02:34:11.714]  Like, oh, you want to own guns, you're racist.
[02:34:11.714 --> 02:34:14.175]  So he just said, well, there's some racism.
[02:34:14.175 --> 02:34:19.978]  And then he goes on to say, a discussion should ensue about the football culture, which is totally degenerate nowadays.
[02:34:19.978 --> 02:34:21.478]  And he added the gun culture.
[02:34:21.478 --> 02:34:24.820]  So they're trying to blame guns for the gangster culture.
[02:34:24.820 --> 02:34:26.140]  Domestic violence.
[02:34:26.140 --> 02:34:27.821]  So now guns are domestic violence.
[02:34:27.821 --> 02:34:30.262]  Those issues should be discussed if we're looking for some kind of
[02:34:30.902 --> 02:34:32.363]  Elusive perspective.
[02:34:32.363 --> 02:34:34.744]  Some more arrogant statements here.
[02:34:34.744 --> 02:34:41.909]  So, not a real apology, but he's gone from saying, oh, let me correct misinterpretations to, oh, let me correct mistakes.
[02:34:43.089 --> 02:34:43.810]  I don't know.
[02:35:02.743 --> 02:35:05.906]  And I guess that's what you see out of Rupert Murdoch right there.
[02:35:05.906 --> 02:35:08.408]  Just unbelievable how disgusting this is.
[02:35:08.408 --> 02:35:17.034]  We're going to air a report I did with Aaron Dykes on this premiering here, and then we're going to go right back to Max Keiser with where he, how he sees the collapse unfolding.
[02:35:17.034 --> 02:35:23.860]  Because unfortunately, it looks like he may be right, and it's an engineered collapse, and ways we can protect ourselves with Max Keiser.
[02:35:23.860 --> 02:35:25.181]  But first, here's this report.
[02:35:25.785 --> 02:35:31.870]  People who have credibility with young people should be on the television telling these youngsters that it's wrong to carry a gun.
[02:35:31.870 --> 02:35:33.592]  Ultimate tragedy, bloodied and dead.
[02:35:33.592 --> 02:35:37.115]  Javon Belcher's action, handguns do not enhance our safety.
[02:35:37.115 --> 02:35:42.059]  And just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[02:35:42.059 --> 02:35:44.762]  The assault weapons ban made sense.
[02:35:44.762 --> 02:35:51.568]  Well, the establishment's war against the right to keep and bear arms and the rest of our Bill of Rights is now reaching a high tide mark.
[02:35:52.308 --> 02:36:00.435]  You can make no mistake, Bob Costas during Sunday Night Football on NBC was declaring war on the Second Amendment.
[02:36:00.435 --> 02:36:02.877]  You want some actual perspective on this?
[02:36:02.877 --> 02:36:07.020]  Well, a bit of it comes from the Kansas City-based writer Jason Whitlock.
[02:36:07.020 --> 02:36:21.412]  Our current gun culture, Whitlock wrote, ensures that more and more domestic disputes will end in the ultimate tragedy, and that more convenience store confrontations over loud music coming from a car will leave more teenage boys bloodied and dead.
[02:36:21.872 --> 02:36:29.596]  And make no mistake, he was reading off a teleprompter at that time, and his remarks had all been pre-approved.
[02:36:29.596 --> 02:36:31.937]  Handguns do not enhance our safety.
[02:36:31.937 --> 02:36:39.261]  They exacerbate our flaws, tempt us to escalate arguments, and bait us into embracing confrontation rather than avoiding it.
[02:36:39.861 --> 02:36:47.807]  Turning the NFL into even more of a propaganda tool of the authoritarians that control Washington, D.C.
[02:36:47.807 --> 02:36:53.271]  If Javon Belcher didn't possess a gun, he and Cassandra Perkins would both be alive today.
[02:36:54.477 --> 02:37:06.047]  Leave it to NBC and Bob Costas to take a tragic event and try to capitalize on it to destroy the Second Amendment of our Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:37:06.047 --> 02:37:14.094]  Coming out and blaming a tragic shooting on the Second Amendment is asinine.
[02:37:14.094 --> 02:37:19.859]  It's like blaming obesity on spoons and forks, but that's exactly what he did.
[02:37:20.680 --> 02:37:26.302]  Costas really thinks we're stupid when he says, you know, there's a gun culture in the NFL.
[02:37:26.302 --> 02:37:30.064]  You mean the thug culture that's in the NFL?
[02:37:30.064 --> 02:37:32.185]  Pit bull fights and all the rest of it?
[02:37:32.185 --> 02:37:33.746]  You mean that culture?
[02:37:33.746 --> 02:37:41.249]  They're trying to claim that the American gun culture is the thug culture that's in the NFL.
[02:37:41.969 --> 02:37:58.364]  Don't blame us for your culture of drugged out of their mind athletes on pain pills and psychotropic drugs like Prozac known to cause psychotic breaks and men who have had concussions after concussions after concussions going home and killing their families.
[02:37:58.364 --> 02:37:58.844]  And you notice...
[02:37:59.545 --> 02:38:06.210]  Bob Costas says, I know in the days to come the NFL may get blamed, but you can't deny it's guns.
[02:38:06.210 --> 02:38:08.552]  If there wouldn't have been guns, this wouldn't have happened.
[02:38:08.552 --> 02:38:10.854]  He's saying, let's blame the Second Amendment.
[02:38:10.854 --> 02:38:13.616]  Let's blame one of the few rights left in this country.
[02:38:13.616 --> 02:38:19.381]  Let's not blame the NFL and the decadent gladiatorial spectacle it's become.
[02:38:19.381 --> 02:38:25.425]  The bureaucracy that's hijacked this country admits they're coming after our firearms.
[02:38:25.425 --> 02:38:28.087]  They have told us that they are doing this.
[02:38:28.087 --> 02:38:28.548]  Part of it
[02:38:29.462 --> 02:38:34.304]  Well, it's not surprising then that they get bitter and they cling to guns or
[02:38:51.050 --> 02:38:54.171]  Think of how stupid the gun grabbers think you are.
[02:38:54.171 --> 02:39:06.175]  They point out the violence that's going on in the youth of this country, in places like Chicago and New York that have the highest crime rates in the United States, where they've completely banned guns for the general public.
[02:39:06.175 --> 02:39:12.257]  And then they point at Chicago and New York and say that's the reason that we need to turn our guns in, in places like Texas.
[02:39:12.617 --> 02:39:15.060]  Frankly, in my hometown of Chicago, there's an awful lot of violence.
[02:39:15.060 --> 02:39:17.903]  And they're not using AK-47s, they're using cheap handguns.
[02:39:17.903 --> 02:39:18.864]  It's incredible.
[02:39:18.864 --> 02:39:31.116]  They take the guns, the crime rates explode in those areas, while the crime rates drop in areas all over the United States, where you have a high rate of legal, lawful gun ownership.
[02:39:32.077 --> 02:39:37.459]  I expected the victim disarmament anti-defense crowd to come out and use this tragedy.
[02:39:37.459 --> 02:39:51.423]  But to see the NFL, NBC, via their frontman Bob Costas do it, lets you know that they are blowing the bugle, that they are charging in on our Second Amendment, and all the facts prove that that is what is now happening.
[02:39:51.423 --> 02:39:57.005]  None of us were under any illusion that reinstating that ban would be easy.
[02:39:58.198 --> 02:40:01.859]  And so what we focused on is existing laws.
[02:40:01.859 --> 02:40:12.102]  If the president would stage Fast and Furious, shipping guns into Mexico to demonize the Second Amendment and call for a gun ban, they will use any crisis out there to restrict our guns.
[02:40:12.102 --> 02:40:18.203]  Trafficking illegal firearms, sending them across the border, is illegal.
[02:40:18.203 --> 02:40:20.124]  That's something that we can stop.
[02:40:20.124 --> 02:40:25.986]  And so our focus is to work with Secretary Napolitano.
[02:40:25.986 --> 02:40:27.066]  Keep in mind, he did it.
[02:40:28.158 --> 02:40:29.479]  He shipped the guns.
[02:40:29.479 --> 02:40:36.541]  Now the reports are beginning to come out that Obama may use executive orders to restrict the Second Amendment because he can't get Congress to do it.
[02:40:36.541 --> 02:40:38.162]  He's already done that on cyber security.
[02:40:38.162 --> 02:40:40.042]  He's already done that shutting down power plants.
[02:40:40.042 --> 02:40:42.643]  He's already said NATO and the UN command our military.
[02:40:42.643 --> 02:40:44.824]  He is becoming a dictator more and more.
[02:40:44.824 --> 02:40:49.526]  They have asked the media to go out and blame everything on our right to keep and bear arms.
[02:40:50.106 --> 02:40:56.010]  People who have credibility with young people should be on the television telling these youngsters that it's wrong to carry a gun.
[02:40:56.010 --> 02:41:05.216]  So what you're seeing is part of the brainwashing that Attorney General Holder called for more than 15 years ago and is calling for again.
[02:41:05.216 --> 02:41:09.980]  And just really brainwashed people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[02:41:09.980 --> 02:41:18.946]  And the fact that Costas would be authorized to do something like this during Sunday football when the NFL lets you know they mean business.
[02:41:19.326 --> 02:41:23.248]  A corporate company man like Costas, you know he got it approved.
[02:41:23.248 --> 02:41:33.254]  So this is the NFL and NBC endorsing an attack on one of the few basic liberties that America has left.
[02:41:33.254 --> 02:41:35.715]  Unbelievably outrageous.
[02:41:35.715 --> 02:41:40.078]  And signals a coordinated attack on the Second Amendment.
[02:41:40.558 --> 02:41:52.011]  And if we won't speak out against this now, if we won't demand that Bob Costas at least apologize for using this tragedy, we're going to lose our Second Amendment.
[02:41:52.011 --> 02:41:53.573]  Now Hank Williams Jr.
[02:41:53.573 --> 02:41:56.937]  said this country was turning into a dictatorship and he was fired.
[02:41:56.937 --> 02:41:59.580]  You mean when John Boehner played golf with President Obama?
[02:42:00.989 --> 02:42:02.290]  Oh yeah!
[02:42:02.290 --> 02:42:05.131]  It'd be like Hitler playing golf with Netanyahu.
[02:42:05.131 --> 02:42:05.892]  Okay?
[02:42:05.892 --> 02:42:06.392]  Okay.
[02:42:06.392 --> 02:42:07.212]  Not hardly.
[02:42:07.212 --> 02:42:16.137]  All we're asking for is that Bob Costas apologize and that the NFL repudiate what was said as well as NBC.
[02:42:17.037 --> 02:42:24.081]  But if that is not done, I promise you this, and over 150 million other gun owners in this country do as well.
[02:42:24.081 --> 02:42:34.726]  We are not going to rest until the NFL loses a large portion of their audience and NBC sponsors are boycotted.
[02:42:34.726 --> 02:42:36.887]  It's time to turn off the NFL.
[02:42:36.887 --> 02:42:38.368]  It's time to turn off NBC.
[02:42:39.008 --> 02:42:44.272]  And it's time to stop watching that little globalist front man, Bob Costas.
[02:42:44.272 --> 02:42:48.715]  It's time to take it personal when they try to take our guns.
[02:42:48.715 --> 02:43:01.244]  That's why I'm calling for everyone to mail spoons with a note explaining to NBC that blaming guns for crime is like blaming spoons for fat people.
[02:43:01.244 --> 02:43:03.906]  And it's time to mail Bob Costas spoons.
[02:43:03.906 --> 02:43:07.629]  We're going to put the address under this video in the links below.
[02:43:08.169 --> 02:43:15.231]  And it's time to call the sponsors of NBC and the NFL and to let them know you're not going to support them either.
[02:43:15.231 --> 02:43:17.772]  It's time for the American people to stand up.
[02:43:17.772 --> 02:43:25.074]  It's time for the sleeping giant that is the United States of America to rediscover the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:43:25.074 --> 02:43:28.655]  These are our rights and you are not going to steal them.
[02:43:28.655 --> 02:43:30.316]  Do you understand this?
[02:43:30.316 --> 02:43:34.037]  The Second Amendment is the line in the sand.
[02:43:34.037 --> 02:43:36.998]  I'm Alex Jones, signing off for InfoWars.com.
[02:43:39.764 --> 02:43:46.490]  All right, that video will be live the next 10 minutes at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and I will tweet it out at the real Alex Jones.
[02:43:46.490 --> 02:43:48.352]  Please retweet it.
[02:43:48.352 --> 02:43:50.834]  And again, also follow Max Keiser at MaxKeiser.com.
[02:43:50.834 --> 02:43:57.801]  Again, I apologize to Max for airing that, but Aaron stayed up all night to get it done and then we wanted it for the first hour, but we were behind and so we aired it now.
[02:43:57.801 --> 02:44:01.344]  We're always honored to have Max Keiser, but it's good to have that in the middle of the report as well.
[02:44:01.344 --> 02:44:03.126]  You've got the floor until we go to break, Max.
[02:44:04.166 --> 02:44:10.991]  Any comments on the gun thing, but getting back into your bold prediction that the collapse is really going to accelerate in April.
[02:44:10.991 --> 02:44:12.712]  You've already broken down why that's happening.
[02:44:12.712 --> 02:44:17.875]  We've got the head of the Bank of England saying what you're saying now, and you're in England right now.
[02:44:17.875 --> 02:44:19.196]  That's pretty creepy.
[02:44:19.196 --> 02:44:24.899]  So tell us what it'll look like and where it goes from there.
[02:44:24.899 --> 02:44:25.900]  Well, first of all, O.J.
[02:44:25.900 --> 02:44:27.161]  Simpson didn't have a gun.
[02:44:27.161 --> 02:44:30.423]  Didn't stop him from killing his wife.
[02:44:31.570 --> 02:44:32.391]  Wow, that's incredible.
[02:44:32.391 --> 02:44:35.474]  I actually made that point in the video, but Aaron cut it out for some reason.
[02:44:35.474 --> 02:44:43.263]  Yeah, Nicole Simpson, she did a nice with a concealed carry when OJ or whoever it was brought that knife to a gunfight.
[02:44:45.017 --> 02:44:45.818]  Yeah.
[02:44:45.818 --> 02:44:50.102]  Well, wasn't Bob Costas involved in a pedophile scandal with Sandusky for a while?
[02:44:50.102 --> 02:44:56.910]  He had him on his show and they were trying to cover that up for a while until Sandusky got on the show and basically admitted he was a pedophile.
[02:44:56.910 --> 02:45:02.515]  And then Bob, you see that image of him all shaken up, like, oh my God, I invited a pedophile on my show.
[02:45:02.515 --> 02:45:05.318]  And then he tried to, you know, talk his way out of it.
[02:45:05.318 --> 02:45:06.520]  So this guy is a loser.
[02:45:06.940 --> 02:45:16.986]  Anyway, talking about the collapse of the central bank system and fiat currencies around the world, this is, as I say, baked into the cake.
[02:45:16.986 --> 02:45:21.349]  Now, I believe we're going to see it by April of 2013.
[02:45:21.349 --> 02:45:26.732]  If I'm wrong, I will happily admit that I was wrong on my timing.
[02:45:26.732 --> 02:45:28.893]  The trends are still there and still in place.
[02:45:28.893 --> 02:45:33.436]  Somebody else will get the timing perhaps better than I have, but I'm going to stick to my timing.
[02:45:34.036 --> 02:45:49.806]  But, you know, in the United States, it's remarkable that two weeks ago, three weeks ago, to give you an idea of the disconnect people have with what's happening in the central banks on Wall Street, remember when there was a threat they were going to close down the producer of Twinkies.
[02:45:49.806 --> 02:45:53.388]  And then within an hour, Twinkies were selling for $8,000 a Twinkie on eBay.
[02:45:55.669 --> 02:46:09.119]  Now that gives you an idea of the disconnect in the United States that the average person has with what the values are that run the system versus what the intrinsic value of a Twinkie actually is.
[02:46:09.119 --> 02:46:17.925]  So, you know, you had this remarkable explosion of Twinkie buying on eBay because people were scared that suddenly Twinkies would not be available anymore.
[02:46:17.925 --> 02:46:23.389]  And then that mania passed six hours or ten hours later and it was on to some other mania.
[02:46:23.689 --> 02:46:35.374]  You know, people, of course, would probably get totally caught up in an NFL game over the weekend where they can watch steroid-driven drug addicts pound each other over the head for a million dollars a quarter.
[02:46:35.374 --> 02:46:35.854]  It's true.
[02:46:37.545 --> 02:46:41.106]  You know, so they're just going from distraction to distraction.
[02:46:41.106 --> 02:47:02.372]  Meanwhile, the main theme here that I need, I'm going to emphasize, is the central banks themselves that for 30, 40 years were colluding in pushing a financialization, a transactionalization, a world where work and labor was replaced with technocracy and money.
[02:47:03.232 --> 02:47:05.634]  They no longer trust each other.
[02:47:05.634 --> 02:47:07.715]  That is a fundamental difference today.
[02:47:07.715 --> 02:47:18.442]  Started in 2009 after the big collapse of 2008 and that and we know that they don't trust each other because they themselves are the biggest buyers of gold.
[02:47:18.442 --> 02:47:24.766]  Now here's the big moment that's going to change everything is when central banks who are now
[02:47:25.706 --> 02:47:31.608]  Issuing money or creating money through quantitative easing to buy government bonds.
[02:47:31.608 --> 02:47:37.830]  One of those central banks is going to break ranks and they're going to start printing money to buy gold.
[02:47:37.830 --> 02:47:47.694]  And that will be the moment when gold starts to go on a magnificent tear on the upside and the global sovereign bond market starts to collapse.
[02:47:47.694 --> 02:47:50.795]  Because one of these banks is going to say enough is enough.
[02:47:50.795 --> 02:47:53.696]  The obvious contenders are China and Russia.
[02:47:54.751 --> 02:47:56.632]  Those are the obvious contenders.
[02:47:56.632 --> 02:48:02.655]  The obvious contenders for currency collapse, hyperinflation we see in Japan and in the UK.
[02:48:02.655 --> 02:48:06.797]  The UK has 900% debt to GDP.
[02:48:06.797 --> 02:48:09.038]  It's one of the worst in the world.
[02:48:09.038 --> 02:48:12.619]  So that's why we're here, because we're covering the collapse in London.
[02:48:12.619 --> 02:48:14.200]  And since we've been here, as you pointed out,
[02:48:14.700 --> 02:48:27.666]  The rhetoric coming out of the Bank of England is that quantitative easing doesn't work anymore, the debts are unsustainable, and the economy is collapsing, and there's very little that anyone can do.
[02:48:27.666 --> 02:48:31.008]  So that's pretty much the scenario up to this point.
[02:48:32.921 --> 02:48:37.424]  How is raising all these massive taxes in Europe and the United States going to fix things?
[02:48:37.424 --> 02:48:38.225]  They're not idiots.
[02:48:38.225 --> 02:48:46.911]  They know when they raise taxes on the poor and middle class, it's going to make these countries like Greece, Ireland, Spain, the United States go into cardiac arrest.
[02:48:46.911 --> 02:48:48.232]  But that's what they're doing.
[02:48:48.232 --> 02:48:58.780]  The Republicans and Democrats are debating how much taxes to raise instead of talking about trying to rebuild the country.
[02:48:58.780 --> 02:48:59.901]  What's your take on that?
[02:49:00.461 --> 02:49:13.009]  Well, raising taxes will not increase the tax take at the end of the year because it'll put more people and companies out of business than any incremental gain on a marginal tax increase.
[02:49:13.009 --> 02:49:15.871]  So, net-net, the tax take is going to be worse.
[02:49:15.871 --> 02:49:30.401]  The reason I point to April of 2013 as my target date for the collapse is because I think the tax revenues reported for 2013 in the United States will be shockingly under estimates, and this will force the major
[02:49:30.401 --> 02:49:30.623]  We're good.
[02:49:35.445 --> 02:49:39.368]  We think we're going to downgrade that again.
[02:49:39.368 --> 02:49:43.751]  But the establishment knows that, so they want to destroy the country.
[02:49:43.751 --> 02:49:45.332]  But the establishment is buying gold.
[02:49:45.332 --> 02:49:46.032]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:49:46.032 --> 02:49:47.853]  They're buying gold and silver.
[02:49:47.853 --> 02:50:02.424]  And because they don't trust each other, and they know that in extremis, even Alan Greenspan famously said that we learned from the collapse of Germany in the 40s that in extremis, only gold is counted as money.
[02:50:03.224 --> 02:50:14.371]  And Alan Greenspan of course is the maestro of the central bank that is the creator of the bubbles that of course are the monster that ate the global economy.
[02:50:14.371 --> 02:50:18.053]  So for him to even point this out is quite significant.
[02:50:18.633 --> 02:50:31.578]  And this is unknown amongst those who understand the history of banking and money, that when you have this type of crisis, gold is really the only extinguisher of debt, is one way to put it.
[02:50:31.578 --> 02:50:35.539]  Sure, and then you continue to kind of put things off, but there's still that slow slide.
[02:50:35.539 --> 02:50:38.120]  I mean, the economy worldwide is getting worse and worse.
[02:50:38.120 --> 02:50:39.661]  I want to come back and ask you, Max.
[02:50:40.481 --> 02:50:47.023]  Well, slow slide, it's deceptive because if you look at a chart like Enron, remember Enron?
[02:50:47.023 --> 02:50:50.164]  The stock went from $2 to $90.
[02:50:50.164 --> 02:50:59.027]  Stay there, explain it to us on the other side, and then I want to ask you, will these globalists get away with it, or is there any way to arrest them, and then how would you fix the economy?
[02:50:59.027 --> 02:51:00.268]  We'll be right back with Max Geiser.
[02:51:01.365 --> 02:51:06.566]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[02:52:01.148 --> 02:52:05.912]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:52:05.912 --> 02:52:08.014]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:52:08.926 --> 02:52:17.890]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:52:17.890 --> 02:52:22.812]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[02:52:54.634 --> 02:52:57.657]  1-866-VENUSFLY or visit Carnivora.com.

[02:52:58.918 --> 02:52:59.959]  It's the only one you've got.
[02:53:01.837 --> 02:53:04.078]  Hey there, Frank Bates here.
[02:53:04.078 --> 02:53:09.140]  Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans?
[02:53:09.140 --> 02:53:10.961]  This is really scary stuff.
[02:53:10.961 --> 02:53:16.223]  Defense experts warn that this odd device poses the gravest threat we've ever known.
[02:53:16.223 --> 02:53:23.407]  In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat.
[02:53:24.247 --> 02:53:27.048]  I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.
[02:53:27.048 --> 02:53:30.829]  It may be because the liberals in the government are trying to cover it up.
[02:53:30.829 --> 02:53:39.371]  That's why my friend just created a free video at WeirdDevice.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors off the conspiracy.
[02:53:39.371 --> 02:53:49.534]  Go watch the shocking video at WeirdDevice.com right now to discover exactly what it is, plus discover the number one way you and your family can survive this deadly attack.
[02:53:50.274 --> 02:53:55.602]  I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to WeirdDevice.com before it's gone forever.
[02:53:55.602 --> 02:53:57.625]  Again, that's WeirdDevice.com.
[02:54:04.974 --> 02:54:10.396]  Hi, we're doing a little bit of overdrive here into the next hour with Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com.
[02:54:10.396 --> 02:54:12.657]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:54:12.657 --> 02:54:13.597]  Christmas is here.
[02:54:13.597 --> 02:54:14.797]  It's time to wake folks up.
[02:54:14.797 --> 02:54:21.739]  We've got the new issue of InfoWars magazine that will be sold out by the end of the day if you want to buy it in bulk at cost.
[02:54:21.739 --> 02:54:25.741]  You can also get a 12-issue subscription, a great gift to give people.
[02:54:25.741 --> 02:54:29.162]  If 12 magazines, glossy, full of info won't wake them up,
[02:54:29.582 --> 02:54:30.742]  Not much will.
[02:54:30.742 --> 02:54:36.284]  We're also selling 10 PrisonPlanet.tv memberships for the price of one, so you can give them to friends and family.
[02:54:36.284 --> 02:54:37.704]  Handle all your shopping.
[02:54:37.704 --> 02:54:39.285]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:54:39.285 --> 02:54:47.067]  And we have the ProPures until December 10th at 15% off the great water filters at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:54:47.067 --> 02:54:48.487]  Going back to Max Keiser.
[02:54:48.487 --> 02:54:49.227]  Okay, Max, go ahead.
[02:54:49.227 --> 02:54:55.089]  You've got the floor with the point you were making about any way to arrest these bankers, any way to bring them to justice.
[02:54:55.089 --> 02:54:56.409]  But you were making another point as well.
[02:54:57.028 --> 02:55:05.741]  Yeah, no, you know, the guests on your show you've had and we've talked about this collapse coming and, you know, the question always is when?
[02:55:05.741 --> 02:55:13.692]  And I think that it's, you know, if you're standing on the surface of the earth, you know, it's tough to see that you're actually
[02:55:13.792 --> 02:55:14.533]  We're good to go.
[02:55:38.428 --> 02:55:45.292]  In France, during the Mississippi bubble, the stock in that Ponzi scheme went from $500,000 to $18,000 to $0.
[02:55:45.292 --> 02:55:49.154]  The South Sea bubble of 1720, the stock went from $100,000 to $1,000 to $100.
[02:55:49.154 --> 02:55:51.495]  More recently, with Enron, the stock went from $2 to $90 to $0.
[02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:02.862]  What I'm saying is that the government bonds in America, the U.S.
[02:56:02.862 --> 02:56:08.366]  Treasury bond, has never been higher in 240 years.
[02:56:08.366 --> 02:56:10.507]  The Treasury bond in the U.K.
[02:56:10.507 --> 02:56:13.750]  has never been higher in 300 years.
[02:56:13.750 --> 02:56:24.637]  And when the bubble pops, it'll collapse by 50, 60, 70 percent with lightning speed, as we've seen with these other historic bubbles.
[02:56:24.637 --> 02:56:27.559]  So it'll be too late to do anything at that time.
[02:56:27.559 --> 02:56:29.221]  You have to be prepared beforehand.
[02:56:30.121 --> 02:56:36.509]  If you want proof of what I'm saying is true, look at what these central banks are doing.
[02:56:36.509 --> 02:56:40.273]  Since 1971, they were net sellers of gold and they bought paper.
[02:56:40.273 --> 02:56:46.740]  But from 2009, after the collapse of 2008 of Lehman Brothers, they became net buyers of gold.
[02:56:47.387 --> 02:56:48.067]  Gold is
[02:57:07.298 --> 02:57:07.679]  Thank you.
[02:57:18.328 --> 02:57:20.969]  Like NASDAQ, from 1981 to 2000, it went from 100 to 5,000, then crashed to 1,500.
[02:57:20.969 --> 02:57:23.590]  In Nikkei, remember the Nikkei bubble from 1970 to 1992, it went from 3,000 to 40,000, then crashed to 8,000.
[02:57:23.590 --> 02:57:27.892]  At one point, you had in Japan that the land under the Royal Palace was worth more than the entire state of California.
[02:57:41.738 --> 02:57:46.501]  Once that happened more than 15 years ago, they've never come back in Japan.
[02:57:46.501 --> 02:57:49.463]  So you're saying there's going to be a treasury bubble go under?
[02:57:49.463 --> 02:57:51.444]  We're in a bubble, treasury bubble.
[02:57:51.444 --> 02:57:54.826]  It's never, oh my God, Alex, the 10-year U.S.
[02:57:54.826 --> 02:57:57.788]  treasury bond has not been this high.
[02:57:57.788 --> 02:57:59.989]  No, no, you're saying it's coming to an end.
[02:57:59.989 --> 02:58:01.950]  It's obviously the biggest bubble in 300 years.
[02:58:01.950 --> 02:58:08.034]  You're saying it begins to pop or will pop coming up on April 15th or thereafter.
[02:58:08.034 --> 02:58:08.875]  How bad will it be?
[02:58:10.812 --> 02:58:17.938]  It'll be, it'll be the worst financial crisis in 100 years, 150 years.
[02:58:17.938 --> 02:58:19.719]  Absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt.
[02:58:19.719 --> 02:58:31.909]  I've talked to a lot of big insiders, including well-known billionaires, and they've said the word is all these companies are pulling back and digging in, and so there's a lot of signs this is coming.
[02:58:31.909 --> 02:58:34.070]  We're gonna go to break, come back a little bit more with Max Keiser.
[02:58:34.070 --> 02:58:35.552]  I'm Alex Jones of InfoWars.com.

[02:59:55.614 --> 03:00:05.241]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.241 --> 03:00:08.804]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[03:00:08.804 --> 03:00:13.547]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.

[03:00:17.105 --> 03:00:20.187]  Yeah, I've got a big retransmission coming up in the resting hour.
[03:00:20.187 --> 03:00:21.489]  We've done over three hours here today.
[03:00:21.489 --> 03:00:25.151]  I'll be back tonight, 7 o'clock, InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:00:25.151 --> 03:00:26.813]  I think David Knight's doing the news tonight.
[03:00:26.813 --> 03:00:28.254]  We're going to have some other special reports.
[03:00:28.254 --> 03:00:32.057]  Tomorrow night we premiere the big Ron Paul film.
[03:00:32.057 --> 03:00:32.797]  Get ready for that.
[03:00:32.797 --> 03:00:34.479]  We've got a bunch of other special things this week.
[03:00:34.479 --> 03:00:37.001]  My big interview with Joe Rogan in person here in Austin.
[03:00:37.001 --> 03:00:38.222]  Very powerful.
[03:00:38.222 --> 03:00:41.865]  That's coming up Thursday night on InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:00:41.865 --> 03:00:43.085]  We'll air parts of it on the radio.
[03:00:44.146 --> 03:00:47.089]  Friday, Max Keiser is our guest.
[03:00:47.089 --> 03:00:49.011]  And Max, you've got the floor still.
[03:00:49.011 --> 03:00:51.774]  Other points you'd like to make, we're all ears.
[03:00:51.774 --> 03:00:53.136]  I know I want to hear what you have to say.
[03:00:53.136 --> 03:00:58.181]  They're gearing up for a police state.
[03:00:58.181 --> 03:01:01.545]  We know they're going to try to just have all these new taxes and regulations.
[03:01:02.405 --> 03:01:07.750]  Six years in jail, $100,000 fines for washing your car with soap suds going in the drain.
[03:01:07.750 --> 03:01:09.672]  Dog poop, six years in jail.
[03:01:09.672 --> 03:01:11.113]  Giant prisons opening everywhere.
[03:01:11.113 --> 03:01:12.935]  I don't think people understand.
[03:01:12.935 --> 03:01:15.157]  The new labor in America will be slave labor.
[03:01:15.157 --> 03:01:15.658]  It already is.
[03:01:17.304 --> 03:01:18.764]  Yeah, sure, absolutely.
[03:01:18.764 --> 03:01:23.466]  Because the economy is contracting, it's collapsing, and there's no growth.
[03:01:23.466 --> 03:01:29.167]  And you can't create growth by forcing interest rates down to zero.
[03:01:29.167 --> 03:01:35.048]  As a matter of fact, that creates deflation, and it creates catastrophe, and they're not going to stop.
[03:01:35.048 --> 03:01:40.630]  Now, I don't know if you saw this, but on Monday, October 22nd of 2012, was a bombshell announcement from Germany.
[03:01:40.630 --> 03:01:45.491]  The statement from Germany included a previously classified report that reveals that the Bundesbank
[03:01:46.374 --> 03:01:56.103]  Withdrew nearly 1,000 tons of gold from the Bank of England in 2000-2001, decreasing Germany's gold holding in London from 1,400 tons to 500 tons.
[03:01:56.103 --> 03:02:06.191]  Now, the reason this is significant is that at the time, Gordon Brown sold 400 tons of Britain's gold, and now we know he did so because
[03:02:07.273 --> 03:02:10.437]  Britain was caught without the gold, Germany's gold.
[03:02:10.437 --> 03:02:14.081]  In other words, Germany went to repatriate their gold in 2001.
[03:02:14.081 --> 03:02:17.605]  And LIBOR has come out proving it's all rigged?
[03:02:17.605 --> 03:02:19.807]  I mean, it's all starting to collapse?
[03:02:19.807 --> 03:02:21.869]  I think you might be right about April.
[03:02:21.869 --> 03:02:24.893]  What I'm saying is that Britain had sold Germany's gold.
[03:02:25.453 --> 03:02:29.876]  They sold Germany's gold, and then when Germany came to collect their gold, they didn't have it.
[03:02:29.876 --> 03:02:46.928]  So Gordon Brown had to force the gold market, crash the gold market by telegraphing a sale of 400 tons, which crashed the gold market down to $250 an ounce, which is considered to be Brown's bottom, the worst price in 20 years, to make good on that claim.
[03:02:46.928 --> 03:02:48.229]  And this is important because
[03:02:49.350 --> 03:02:57.199]  You've got Austria now, and Germany, Venezuela, and all countries around the world that are repatriating gold.
[03:02:57.199 --> 03:03:02.926]  Not because we're going to a gold standard, but because they are protecting themselves against currency collapse.
[03:03:02.926 --> 03:03:04.909]  That's a distinction that people don't understand.
[03:03:05.569 --> 03:03:14.635]  We're not going to a gold standard where people have hordes of gold located in banks around the world and then, because of trade imbalances, you will move gold from one stock to another.
[03:03:14.635 --> 03:03:15.975]  No, that's not what we're talking about.
[03:03:15.975 --> 03:03:30.164]  We're talking about these countries are now repatriating gold or amassing huge gold positions as a way to protect themselves against this fiat currency collapse, which is now a 100% dead certainty due to 0% interest rates, thanks to
[03:03:30.484 --> 03:03:36.205]  Ben Bernanke and other central bankers around the world that have thrown the global economy under the bus.
[03:03:36.205 --> 03:03:41.627]  There's hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of debt.
[03:03:41.627 --> 03:03:49.629]  You know, some call that, you know, derivatives, which is the same, another word for debt, which cannot possibly be paid back in 10,000 years.
[03:03:49.629 --> 03:03:52.089]  And there is no growth to pay for it anyway.
[03:03:52.089 --> 03:03:54.230]  So all that is going the way of the dodo.
[03:03:55.070 --> 03:04:01.913]  And the only thing that can give anyone any semblance of wealth preservation is going to be gold.
[03:04:01.913 --> 03:04:02.253]  I agree.
[03:04:02.253 --> 03:04:03.154]  We're almost out of time.
[03:04:03.154 --> 03:04:03.914]  Let me just say this.
[03:04:03.914 --> 03:04:11.518]  The one heartening thing I see is a lot of these top bankers are buying houses in armored retreats in third world countries and distant islands.
[03:04:11.518 --> 03:04:14.359]  And a lot of them are just pulling out and leaving.
[03:04:14.359 --> 03:04:16.300]  I think they know they're all going to get arrested.
[03:04:16.300 --> 03:04:22.783]  So we might actually be able to expose them and then use the crisis they've created to finally kick out the globalist.
[03:04:24.790 --> 03:04:27.211]  Great.
[03:04:27.211 --> 03:04:29.632]  What's funny about that?
[03:04:29.632 --> 03:04:37.975]  Well, they can get on a jet and they're on an island in two hours and we'll never hear from them again.
[03:04:37.975 --> 03:04:48.679]  But they're going to leave behind a complete and utter chaos and there's currently no system to keep that out of control.
[03:04:48.679 --> 03:04:48.919]  No, I agree.
[03:04:48.919 --> 03:04:51.220]  We're going to have to talk about this.
[03:04:51.940 --> 03:04:52.921]  You want to keep going, Max?
[03:04:52.921 --> 03:04:54.243]  You want to keep going on this subject?
[03:04:54.243 --> 03:04:55.344]  I'm in for a warrior!
[03:04:55.344 --> 03:04:56.425]  I'm in for you!
[03:04:56.425 --> 03:04:56.825]  Stay there!
[03:04:56.825 --> 03:04:57.186]  Overdriving!
[03:04:57.186 --> 03:04:57.986]  Overdriving!
[03:04:57.986 --> 03:04:58.827]  Overdriving!
[03:04:58.827 --> 03:04:59.428]  Overdriving!
[03:05:01.858 --> 03:05:07.641]  Sodium fluoride in the body reduces IQ and increases cancers.
[03:05:07.641 --> 03:05:15.004]  Unfortunately, fluoride and its derivatives are only one of hundreds of toxins being added to our drinking water.
[03:05:15.004 --> 03:05:17.746]  We're battling the globalist on so many fronts.
[03:05:17.746 --> 03:05:23.789]  Health is an area where we can all take control of our lives and it all starts with that basic building block of water.
[03:05:24.469 --> 03:05:27.492]  It is time to purify our family's water.
[03:05:27.492 --> 03:05:34.380]  The ProPure filtration system with added fluoride filters is the best system from my research to protect you and your family.
[03:05:34.380 --> 03:05:39.686]  Infowarstore.com already has the lowest prices on ProPure water filtration.

[03:06:02.469 --> 03:06:02.909]  December 4th, 2012.

[03:06:20.970 --> 03:06:22.371]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:06:22.371 --> 03:06:27.677]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[03:06:27.677 --> 03:06:28.538]  Wait a sec.
[03:06:28.538 --> 03:06:32.942]  Gold and silver is going up while Congress is trying to settle on the next debt increase.
[03:06:32.942 --> 03:06:34.664]  And there's no end to this madness.
[03:06:34.664 --> 03:06:39.750]  That old 401k and IRA can be converted into physical gold without tax consequences.
[03:06:40.410 --> 03:06:43.353]  I explained this in my book, 10 Reasons to Buy Gold.

[03:08:07.356 --> 03:08:10.717]  The Empire is on the run.
[03:08:10.717 --> 03:08:17.519]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:17.519 --> 03:08:17.639]  J.P.
[03:08:17.639 --> 03:08:22.680]  Morgan will get your tax money!
[03:08:22.680 --> 03:08:23.820]  Ha ha!
[03:08:23.820 --> 03:08:25.781]  We are back live!
[03:08:28.820 --> 03:08:30.142]  Devil take the split!
[03:08:30.142 --> 03:08:32.145]  The Ace of Spades!
[03:08:32.145 --> 03:08:34.428]  The New World Order is upon us!
[03:08:37.614 --> 03:08:39.175]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[03:08:39.175 --> 03:08:39.896]  to 2 p.m.
[03:08:39.896 --> 03:08:44.340]  Central, but a lot of times we're going to overdrive, and we are live, live, live.
[03:08:44.340 --> 03:08:50.185]  You know, I'm looking at the YouTube comments on NFL declares war on the Second Amendment for Obama.
[03:08:50.185 --> 03:08:59.933]  A highly produced, very powerful video piece I did with Aaron Dykes that Aaron stayed up all night to get completed, and it is now up at Infowars.com.
[03:08:59.933 --> 03:09:05.418]  It is now the featured video on one of our big YouTube channels, the one with 252 million views.
[03:09:06.218 --> 03:09:12.160]  And we need this to go mega viral because Costas is calling it a mistake because you're so stupid you don't understand him.
[03:09:12.160 --> 03:09:14.701]  His apology is an insult to everyone.
[03:09:14.701 --> 03:09:15.941]  So Costas, that's it.
[03:09:15.941 --> 03:09:17.022]  You need to be fired.
[03:09:17.022 --> 03:09:21.143]  You guys fired Hank Williams Jr.
[03:09:21.143 --> 03:09:23.764]  for saying Obama was becoming a dictator.
[03:09:23.764 --> 03:09:26.765]  He clarified to say both parties were bad and he was fired.
[03:09:26.765 --> 03:09:28.646]  Well, you need to be fired then.
[03:09:28.646 --> 03:09:31.767]  Oh, but you just want to get people fired who stand up for America.
[03:09:31.767 --> 03:09:34.088]  You want to be able to take our liberties and our basic freedoms.
[03:09:35.208 --> 03:09:42.472]  Max Keiser is held over with us into overdrive here right now because we were getting into the economy.
[03:09:42.472 --> 03:09:44.974]  But one more point on guns since he raised it.
[03:09:44.974 --> 03:09:50.657]  Yeah, Nicole Simpson and Ron Goldman, that was his name, wasn't it?
[03:09:50.657 --> 03:09:53.519]  They were both killed by someone wielding a knife.
[03:09:53.519 --> 03:09:54.700]  We all know it wasn't OJ.
[03:09:54.700 --> 03:09:56.801]  He's a wonderful person.
[03:09:56.801 --> 03:09:59.263]  But the point is, is that
[03:10:00.143 --> 03:10:09.114]  Imagine if they would have had guns, but you always read about this place with gun bans, like London and Chicago and New York and LA, where it's highly restricted.
[03:10:09.114 --> 03:10:12.618]  People don't have guns, somebody comes up with a knife and they stab you to death.
[03:10:12.618 --> 03:10:19.286]  I mean, somebody comes to me with a knife, or somebody comes to most people in Texas, people carrying guns, you just pull it out and shoot them.
[03:10:19.997 --> 03:10:20.758]  I mean, it's like a joke.
[03:10:20.758 --> 03:10:29.693]  It's like Indiana Jones and Raiders of the Lost Ark where the guy's got the big sword and he's gonna chop his head off and does this fancy move and he just pulls out his revolver and shoots him.
[03:10:31.457 --> 03:10:33.279]  Criminals don't want you to be armed.
[03:10:33.279 --> 03:10:37.662]  Criminals support gun control because they want disarmed slaves.
[03:10:37.662 --> 03:10:43.807]  And, you know, Bob Costas, it's not his fault that he came and called for a ban on the Second Amendment on handguns.
[03:10:43.807 --> 03:10:45.508]  It's the fault of the microphone.
[03:10:45.508 --> 03:10:46.829]  I agree with Bob Costas.
[03:10:46.829 --> 03:10:48.350]  Guns are at fault.
[03:10:48.350 --> 03:10:50.432]  Spoons are at fault for fat people.
[03:10:50.432 --> 03:10:52.494]  And Bob Costas' microphone is at fault.
[03:10:55.009 --> 03:10:55.950]  And O.J.'
[03:10:55.910 --> 03:10:56.630]  's not at fault.
[03:10:56.630 --> 03:10:59.373]  His knife is at fault.
[03:10:59.373 --> 03:10:59.713]  O.J.
[03:10:59.713 --> 03:11:02.415]  Simpson's knife is at fault.
[03:11:02.415 --> 03:11:06.999]  And a guy killed his dad and some other people with a dagger and a bow and arrow yesterday?
[03:11:06.999 --> 03:11:10.101]  The bow and arrow's at fault.
[03:11:10.101 --> 03:11:13.144]  Sorry, Max Keiser, I'm kind of ranting off into that subject.
[03:11:13.144 --> 03:11:18.028]  I'm beginning to understand the logic, though, that I am a racist because I'm against taking guns.
[03:11:18.028 --> 03:11:22.211]  In fact, Fox Sports guy says you're KKK.
[03:11:22.211 --> 03:11:23.112]  I know KKK
[03:11:23.632 --> 03:11:28.298]  Passed the first gun laws in the U.S., so you'd actually, the KKK is for gun control, but doesn't matter.
[03:11:28.298 --> 03:11:32.363]  I guess he's right, history's wrong, and spoons are evil.
[03:11:32.363 --> 03:11:38.071]  Sorry, though, I mean, I guess they did dig out Alcatraz with a spoon, at least in that Clint Eastwood movie, so maybe it is true.
[03:11:38.071 --> 03:11:41.295]  I mean, they say that, you know, Zero Dark Thirty's real, too.
[03:11:41.295 --> 03:11:41.916]  Easter Bunny's real.
[03:11:42.476 --> 03:11:44.237]  Sorry, Max, we've got 10 minutes left in this segment.
[03:11:44.237 --> 03:11:45.998]  You held over.
[03:11:45.998 --> 03:11:46.818]  Here's my question.
[03:11:46.818 --> 03:11:50.480]  I pointed out, can't we just arrest the globalists that committed all the crimes?
[03:11:50.480 --> 03:11:53.942]  MF Global got caught lying, stealing the money, didn't get in trouble.
[03:11:53.942 --> 03:11:58.004]  I mean, if the law was in place, they would all be going to jail.
[03:11:58.004 --> 03:12:01.245]  But you just laughed and said, well, yeah, but they'll all just fly to their island.
[03:12:01.245 --> 03:12:05.647]  My point is they're getting the islands and digging in in Paraguayan places.
[03:12:05.647 --> 03:12:08.769]  And I've talked to some of the top minions of these people.
[03:12:08.769 --> 03:12:11.350]  They are scared of us, and they don't think they're going to get away with it.
[03:12:11.750 --> 03:12:15.594]  Because they were so greedy, none of them could even control themselves.
[03:12:15.594 --> 03:12:23.062]  So I understand they're going to leave us with the system, the predatory, cannibalistic, soylent green system.
[03:12:23.062 --> 03:12:25.504]  But it is a good sign that they don't think they're going to get away with it.
[03:12:25.504 --> 03:12:27.026]  Or, what's your point on that?
[03:12:27.506 --> 03:12:28.627]  How do we get out of this?
[03:12:28.627 --> 03:12:30.068]  How do we bring them to justice?
[03:12:30.068 --> 03:12:43.141]  I think we expose that they're the authors of this system and so that collectivism through corporate fascism is always discredited via the crony monopoly system they've created that they use to scapegoat the free market.
[03:12:43.141 --> 03:12:49.546]  JP Morgan ran an ad about how their free market and how they basically brought us America when they're the opposite of free market.
[03:12:49.546 --> 03:12:52.930]  How do we defeat that so they can't demonize real free markets?
[03:12:54.284 --> 03:13:00.368]  Oh yeah, before I forget, wasn't Jimmy the Greek fired for alleged racist comments?
[03:13:00.368 --> 03:13:10.175]  Now, if Costas and his crew are saying that Second Amendment supporters are racist, then using the Jimmy Greek standard, he should be fired.
[03:13:10.175 --> 03:13:20.103]  Well yeah, the guy he quoted, he said he endorsed the columns, says that inherently whites are racist and inherently gun owners are quote KKK.
[03:13:20.939 --> 03:13:28.285]  Okay, well, they fired Jimmy the Greek for making allegedly racist comments, so Bob Costas has got to go.
[03:13:28.285 --> 03:13:38.914]  So, yeah, the folks who are trading the billions out there who can hop on an airplane and land anywhere, and they... I just sent you a story.
[03:13:38.914 --> 03:13:41.476]  This was in Spiegel, their Spiegel magazine.
[03:13:41.476 --> 03:13:42.898]  This is a new study that came out.
[03:13:42.898 --> 03:13:45.320]  Shared traders are more reckless than psychopaths.
[03:13:46.210 --> 03:13:50.532]  So it's incorrect to equate JP Morgan and Jamie Dimon to a psychopath.
[03:13:50.532 --> 03:13:52.953]  He's much more reckless than a psychopath.
[03:13:52.953 --> 03:13:54.613]  Yes.
[03:13:54.613 --> 03:14:04.217]  And that's what the problem is, is that you're dealing with a much worse element than your common garden variety mass murderer.
[03:14:04.217 --> 03:14:12.460]  You're dealing with somebody who's diseased to the point of there is very little that's in the case history of medical records
[03:14:12.700 --> 03:14:12.800]  It's
[03:14:33.460 --> 03:14:35.241]  We're good to go.
[03:14:52.037 --> 03:14:55.779]  of millions of people, because they're beyond psychopathic.
[03:14:55.779 --> 03:15:05.484]  They're the worst, most degenerate minds that this species have ever put forward.
[03:15:05.484 --> 03:15:08.865]  In many, many millions of years of evolution, this is what we've come to.
[03:15:08.865 --> 03:15:14.168]  They are the alpha degenerate criminals who say they're doing God's work, destroying the world economy.
[03:15:15.898 --> 03:15:24.665]  And the proof is in the people committing suicide every day around the world as the result of their austerity measures that they put in place to pay themselves these bonuses.
[03:15:24.665 --> 03:15:26.786]  I just got a story confirmed today.
[03:15:26.786 --> 03:15:33.891]  The Papandreou, the former head of Greece, they just found 550 million euros in his mom's account.
[03:15:33.891 --> 03:15:44.339]  Remember that when they refused to do the referendum in Greece, giving the people a chance to vote on the Troika's takeover of Greece, I said at the time this was for some kind of payoff.
[03:15:44.879 --> 03:15:53.305]  And because there was a meeting with John Paulson, Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, and Papandreou in Greece, talking about destroying Greece and carving up what's left.
[03:15:53.305 --> 03:15:57.668]  Yeah, if I saw that, I mean, I saw that he should be immediately arrested, but of course he won't be.
[03:15:57.668 --> 03:15:58.828]  He'll probably be given a knighthood.
[03:15:58.828 --> 03:16:00.009]  Well, that was the payoff.
[03:16:00.009 --> 03:16:07.434]  So, 5,000 years of democracy was traded for a 550 million dollar euro kickback to Papandreou.
[03:16:07.434 --> 03:16:09.175]  He sold his country for that amount of money.
[03:16:09.175 --> 03:16:12.478]  Now we know, the proof is in now the figures.
[03:16:12.478 --> 03:16:14.059]  They've got the numbers, they've got the timing.
[03:16:14.879 --> 03:16:17.161]  He sold out Greece for that amount of money.
[03:16:17.161 --> 03:16:19.863]  So that's beyond a pathology.
[03:16:19.863 --> 03:16:25.907]  I mean, you're not even, you know, some of the worst tyrants ever in history would be... And how are they getting away with it?
[03:16:25.907 --> 03:16:33.153]  McClatchy confirms and says Al-Qaeda is being given missiles by the United States to attack all these countries like Syria.
[03:16:33.153 --> 03:16:36.515]  I mean, the government runs Al-Qaeda.
[03:16:36.515 --> 03:16:39.858]  Well, to get back to a recurring theme, all of these
[03:16:41.064 --> 03:16:48.531]  Wars and terrorists, banking terrorists and financial terrorism require money.
[03:16:48.531 --> 03:16:55.116]  And the money comes from slush funds, whether it's the shadow banking system, which has now been raised from $62 trillion.
[03:16:55.116 --> 03:17:00.201]  They just raised it up to $69 trillion, is now believed to be in the shadow banking system.
[03:17:00.201 --> 03:17:05.145]  And that exists entirely due to interest rates.
[03:17:08.561 --> 03:17:08.921]  I think so.
[03:17:38.331 --> 03:17:45.753]  Here's the bank, and we're going to let you borrow any amount of money for 0% interest rate, and you never have to pay back the interest.
[03:17:45.753 --> 03:17:46.773]  Just how much do you need?
[03:17:46.773 --> 03:17:47.353]  $10 billion?
[03:17:47.353 --> 03:17:48.133]  $20 billion?
[03:17:48.133 --> 03:17:48.973]  $30 billion?
[03:17:48.973 --> 03:17:50.494]  The worst tyrants in history.
[03:17:50.494 --> 03:17:56.395]  Now we've given them carte blanche, an open check, blank check, at 0% interest rate.
[03:17:56.395 --> 03:18:03.757]  So they're doing the worst things you could possibly imagine, because they have all the money in the world to do the worst things, and there's nobody
[03:18:04.537 --> 03:18:11.300]  Suggesting that interest rates should be increased because they keep saying, well, we have to worry about deflation.
[03:18:11.300 --> 03:18:12.581]  No, that's not true.
[03:18:12.581 --> 03:18:14.242]  You're causing the deflation.
[03:18:14.242 --> 03:18:17.563]  They're causing this catastrophe with low interest rates.
[03:18:19.460 --> 03:18:24.304]  This plague of banking terrorists, you need to raise interest rates.
[03:18:24.304 --> 03:18:28.627]  To increase the cost of funds so they can't afford to do what they're doing.
[03:18:28.627 --> 03:18:30.429]  But no one's going to do that.
[03:18:30.429 --> 03:18:35.473]  As a matter of fact, they're dropping interest rates to below zero.
[03:18:35.473 --> 03:18:39.216]  In Switzerland, the rate on your savings account is now negative.
[03:18:39.216 --> 03:18:43.739]  They make you pay to put money there because, and again, they have a
[03:18:44.740 --> 03:18:49.244]  A depression in the real economy, but inflation in the goods.
[03:18:49.244 --> 03:18:52.567]  A double whammy, all so they can give themselves free money.
[03:18:52.567 --> 03:18:53.108]  Amazing.
[03:18:53.108 --> 03:18:54.969]  Max Keiser, we've got 60 seconds left.
[03:18:54.969 --> 03:18:55.630]  Final comments.
[03:18:58.271 --> 03:19:08.396]  Well, you know, whether my date holds up, my April date for a major, major break, possibly Japan, we'll see.
[03:19:08.396 --> 03:19:17.341]  I have no reason to move that date based on the increase in anxiety and pressures and gold purchased by Central Bank.
[03:19:17.341 --> 03:19:19.502]  These things are coming together in real time.
[03:19:19.802 --> 03:19:27.346]  I hope I'm correct, because I'd like to go down, you know, on your show as having called it to within a one-week time period.
[03:19:27.346 --> 03:19:31.248]  That's my goal, to be the most prescient prognosticator of the year.
[03:19:31.248 --> 03:19:34.410]  You know, I hope it works out.
[03:19:34.410 --> 03:19:36.791]  Well said, Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com.
[03:19:36.791 --> 03:19:37.572]  Thank you so much, Max.
[03:19:39.087 --> 03:19:39.708]  All right, man.
[03:19:39.708 --> 03:19:40.308]  See you soon.
[03:19:40.308 --> 03:19:41.149]  Talk to him soon.
[03:19:41.149 --> 03:19:42.491]  We're going to start doing a weekly report.
[03:19:42.491 --> 03:19:43.692]  Very exciting.
[03:19:43.692 --> 03:19:45.273]  OK, folks, we are out of time.
[03:19:45.273 --> 03:19:46.635]  We're going into retransmission now.
[03:19:46.635 --> 03:19:51.540]  I know some stations carry this fourth hour, but back tonight, 7 o'clock, InfoWars Nightly News Central.
[03:19:51.540 --> 03:19:53.562]  Back tomorrow, Lord willing, pray for us.
[03:19:53.562 --> 03:19:55.504]  This is dangerous business we're in.
[03:19:55.504 --> 03:19:55.804]  11 a.m.
[03:19:55.804 --> 03:19:58.227]  Central for the radio, 12 noon Eastern.
[03:19:58.227 --> 03:19:58.988]  God bless you all.
