[00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:01.911]  I'm David Knight with the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:02.591 --> 00:00:06.415]  Now yesterday, two related stories broke on the Drudge Report and elsewhere nationally.
[00:00:06.715 --> 00:00:11.519]  The first one was from InfoWars.com, and it talked about an update to the Batman shooter killings.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.525]  Now in that update, an inmate told by James Holmes that he was programmed to kill by an evil therapist.
[00:00:17.725 --> 00:00:22.229]  He felt like he was in a video game, and he said music from the soundtrack was a trigger for him to kill.
[00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:25.232]  Now the other story concerns the death of a CIA scientist in 1953.
[00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:34.716]  Now, both sides agree that Dr. Frank Olson died from a fall through a closed window with the curtains drawn at the high-rise Statler Hotel.
[00:00:35.176 --> 00:00:41.683]  They also agree that he was given, nine days earlier, a brandy that was laced with LSD in a CIA meeting.
[00:00:42.256 --> 00:00:50.347]  But after 60 years, Frank Olson's family has filed suit alleging that the CIA murdered their father because he was going to resign.
[00:00:50.427 --> 00:00:51.229]  Why would he resign?
[00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:57.257]  Because he was horrified by the biological and chemical experiments that he had witnessed while working at the CIA.
[00:00:58.248 --> 00:01:06.514]  Now, a 2009 book titled, A Terrible Mistake, The Murder of Frank Olson and the CIA's Secret Cold War Experiments, by H.P.
[00:01:06.714 --> 00:01:18.502]  Albarelli, does an excellent job of chronicling not only the death of Dr. Olson, but the key roles that Nazi war criminals and Japanese war criminals played in developing these programs for the CIA.
[00:01:18.842 --> 00:01:25.747]  It also discusses the origins of the MKULTRA program and the assassination programs that the CIA created
[00:01:26.347 --> 00:01:27.068]  At that time.
[00:01:27.468 --> 00:01:33.090]  Now, one of the problems I have with the book is that it takes the naive position that these experiments have stopped.
[00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.991]  Really?
[00:01:34.011 --> 00:01:37.232]  Do we really have a kinder and gentler CIA?
[00:01:37.652 --> 00:01:45.936]  Well, yes, 20 years after Dr. Olson's murder, some of the dark secrets of the CIA were revealed during the Church Committee as well as the Rockefeller Commission hearings.
[00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:51.158]  You may recall then-director of the CIA, William Colby, demonstrating a heart attack gun.
[00:01:51.338 --> 00:01:54.600]  Yes, Mr. Chairman, and a special one was developed which
[00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.572]  Potentially would be able to enter the target without perception.
[00:02:00.573 --> 00:02:03.935]  But the CIA and many in power at the time were very angry about that.
[00:02:04.135 --> 00:02:07.097]  And William Colby was replaced by George H.W.
[00:02:07.137 --> 00:02:07.377]  Bush.
[00:02:08.075 --> 00:02:11.896]  The Olson family had, at that time, been looking for justice for 20 years.
[00:02:12.557 --> 00:02:16.278]  And in the background, some familiar names were obstructing that justice.
[00:02:16.638 --> 00:02:21.640]  Donald Rumsfeld was then the White House Chief of Staff, and Dick Cheney was a White House assistant.
[00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:30.623]  And it was discovered 10 years ago by a history researcher in the President Ford Library that the two of them were conspiring in memos to cover up Dr. Frank Olson's death.
[00:02:30.863 --> 00:02:33.884]  This is what they found in a memo between Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld.
[00:02:34.324 --> 00:02:40.466]  The Olson lawyers will seek to explore all the circumstances of Dr. Olson's employment, as well as those concerning his death.
[00:02:41.087 --> 00:02:53.011]  In any trial, it may become apparent that we're concealing evidence for national security reasons, and any settlement or judgment reached thereafter could be perceived as money paid to cover up the activities of the CIA.
[00:02:53.211 --> 00:02:57.053]  Well, in fact, they did pay money to the Olson family during the Ford administration.
[00:02:57.753 --> 00:03:00.934]  It was kind of hush money, but what the family really wanted was justice.
[00:03:01.154 --> 00:03:02.775]  What the family really wanted was truth.
[00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.480]  And there hasn't been a change of heart at the CIA.
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.762]  There really wasn't even a change of regime and power.
[00:03:08.962 --> 00:03:12.183]  Rumsfeld and Cheney were still players at the time of September 11th.
[00:03:12.463 --> 00:03:14.545]  And the Bushes had significant ties to bin Laden.
[00:03:14.725 --> 00:03:23.309]  Now the book, A Terrible Mistake, does a great job of laying out the ruthless origins of these assassination and mind control programs, as well as biological and chemical weapons.
[00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:34.476]  ...does a great job of explaining to people who may not have understood the origins of these programs and the parts that war criminals from Nazi Germany and from Japan played in this.
[00:03:34.736 --> 00:03:37.617]  But over the years, they have not backed off from these programs.
[00:03:37.677 --> 00:03:45.022]  Instead, they've continued to refine these programs so that today, they're more adept at hiding them, as well as more sophisticated technologically.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.581]  This was the leading chairman of departments of psychiatry at the major medical schools.
[00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:55.343]  Grandfathers of 20th century psychiatry, editors of leading academic journals.
[00:03:55.843 --> 00:03:59.904]  One of the most amazing things I found about his brain electrode implants.
[00:04:00.364 --> 00:04:08.027]  I found dozens and dozens of articles from UCLA, Tulane, Yale, and Harvard primarily.
[00:04:08.407 --> 00:04:11.708]  Just as they experimented and killed scientists who worked with them 60 years ago,
[00:04:12.361 --> 00:04:17.287]  They still experiment and use scientists who work with them like James Holmes, the Batman shooter.
[00:04:18.208 --> 00:04:20.491]  I'm David Knight for InfoWars Knightly News.
