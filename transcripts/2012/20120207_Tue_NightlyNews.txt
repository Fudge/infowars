[00:00:22.426 --> 00:00:24.627]  Good evening and welcome to InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:24.707 --> 00:00:25.788]  I'm your host Rob Due.
[00:00:25.868 --> 00:00:28.390]  Today is February 7th, 2012.
[00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.151]  We're already into the second month of 2012.
[00:00:31.512 --> 00:00:32.152]  I can't believe it.
[00:00:32.512 --> 00:00:33.593]  Got a big show coming up.
[00:00:34.253 --> 00:00:36.515]  Alex is going to interview with Mark Morano.
[00:00:36.815 --> 00:00:40.137]  So Alex will be doing half the show and I'll be doing this part right here.
[00:00:40.417 --> 00:00:42.258]  And they're going to be talking about a host of things.
[00:00:42.898 --> 00:00:50.023]  Mark was recently accused of being a Taliban agent or something of that sort by other climate conspiracy people.
[00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:55.568]  We're going to be talking about the TSA, a bunch of Ron Paul voting shenanigans going on in Nevada.
[00:00:55.928 --> 00:01:01.370]  But first, it's our first news, of course, is, well, you know, Department of Homeland Security.
[00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.371]  Anybody who pays cash for anything could be a terrorist.
[00:01:06.152 --> 00:01:07.332]  Here's our headline, FBI.
[00:01:07.752 --> 00:01:12.573]  Paying cash for a cup of coffee, a potential indicator of terrorist activity.
[00:01:12.613 --> 00:01:13.974]  And this is from Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:01:15.123 --> 00:01:19.768]  And they put out a bunch of flyers and they want people to be looking out for any type of mundane activity.
[00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:21.670]  And here's the quote.
[00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:31.140]  As we documented on numerous occasions, the federal government routinely characterizes mundane behavior as extremist activity or a potential indicator of terrorist intent.
[00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:54.459]  As part of its See Something Say Something campaign, the DHS educates the public that generic activities performed by millions of people every day, including using a video camera, talking to police officers, wearing hoodies, driving vans, well that's me, writing on a piece of paper, that's me too, using a cell phone, that's me, and are potential signs of terrorist activity.
[00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.481]  So I'm on three of those lists.
[00:01:57.422 --> 00:01:59.103]  Let's see what else they have.
[00:01:59.123 --> 00:02:00.965]  In fact, if you go to the article,
[00:02:02.136 --> 00:02:07.389]  You can see, you can download a zip file of all the potential terrorist activities.
[00:02:08.792 --> 00:02:11.499]  One, of course, which is an internet cafe, but let's go to the first one.
[00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:13.852]  Construction sites.
[00:02:14.652 --> 00:02:16.053]  Financial institutions.
[00:02:16.513 --> 00:02:18.274]  General aviation airports.
[00:02:18.654 --> 00:02:20.955]  Martial arts and paintball activities.
[00:02:21.815 --> 00:02:23.796]  Military surplus stores.
[00:02:24.376 --> 00:02:26.437]  Peroxide-based explosives.
[00:02:26.757 --> 00:02:28.718]  Bulk fuel distributors.
[00:02:29.318 --> 00:02:30.619]  Electronic stores.
[00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:32.760]  Hotels and motels.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.801]  There's Internet Cafe.
[00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:35.761]  Buy your coffee.
[00:02:35.781 --> 00:02:36.522]  You're a terrorist.
[00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:38.142]  Rental cars.
[00:02:39.143 --> 00:02:40.924]  Farm supply stores.
[00:02:42.398 --> 00:02:44.899]  Large retail and home improvement stores.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.761]  Shopping malls and entertainment facilities.
[00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:49.581]  Rental properties.
[00:02:50.042 --> 00:02:51.422]  Storage facilities.
[00:02:51.442 --> 00:02:52.383]  Uh-oh, here we go.
[00:02:52.403 --> 00:02:53.043]  Here's the big one.
[00:02:53.143 --> 00:02:54.404]  Here's who you know, you're a terrorist.
[00:02:54.564 --> 00:02:55.764]  Tattoo shops.
[00:02:57.485 --> 00:02:59.866]  Wholesale distributors of beauty and drug.
[00:03:00.687 --> 00:03:02.268]  Airport service providers.
[00:03:02.568 --> 00:03:03.908]  Dive and boat shops.
[00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:05.429]  Hobby shops.
[00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:07.230]  Mass transportation.
[00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.811]  Rental trucks.
[00:03:09.926 --> 00:03:17.443]  People, if you breathe air or drink water, you might be a terrorist, according to the FBI.
[00:03:17.784 --> 00:03:19.708]  So they're going to have all these agents out there.
[00:03:21.013 --> 00:03:27.078]  Looking at everything you do, questioning you, making little snide remarks of, oh, why are you paying with cash?
[00:03:27.138 --> 00:03:27.919]  And stuff like that.
[00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:30.361]  And it's just going to keep going and going and going.
[00:03:30.421 --> 00:03:33.603]  Please, go get the documents.
[00:03:33.784 --> 00:03:34.244]  Print them out.
[00:03:34.304 --> 00:03:35.305]  Read them for yourself.
[00:03:35.785 --> 00:03:36.626]  It's ridiculous.
[00:03:37.066 --> 00:03:38.607]  You're the terrorist out there.
[00:03:38.948 --> 00:03:39.808]  It's not Al Qaeda.
[00:03:39.848 --> 00:03:42.110]  It's not Osama Bin Laden with a bomb jacket.
[00:03:42.391 --> 00:03:43.331]  They're looking at you.
[00:03:44.192 --> 00:03:46.374]  And if you're in the military, they're definitely looking at you.
[00:03:46.994 --> 00:03:47.515]  Moving on.
[00:03:49.184 --> 00:03:52.388]  Senate passes bill allowing airports to evict TSA.
[00:03:52.428 --> 00:03:53.109]  Yay!
[00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:54.450]  Looks like a victory for us.
[00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:07.004]  The Senate has passed legislation that includes a provision allowing airports to replace TSA with private security, opening the door for the widely loathed federal agency to be marginalized from aviation security altogether.
[00:04:07.845 --> 00:04:26.778]  Following the massive nationwide backlash against TSA's invasive groping policies and its use of radiation-firing naked body scanners linked by many prestigious health bodies to cancer, an increasing number of airports have attempted to take responsibility for their own screening procedures by replacing TSA workers with privately hired personnel.
[00:04:26.798 --> 00:04:27.718]  And that's the way it should be.
[00:04:27.738 --> 00:04:32.321]  It should be free market because the thing with the TSA is you're not allowed to complain about what they do.
[00:04:32.381 --> 00:04:37.525]  Because if you do, you're either fined or you miss your flight or you're put on a no-fly list.
[00:04:38.625 --> 00:04:48.469]  So by doing it privately, at least you have the ability to complain to somebody and those complaints will be heard because those people actually care because they're getting paid for the job they do.
[00:04:48.929 --> 00:04:52.851]  It's not like with the TSA, they already have your money, so they don't care if you complain.
[00:04:54.691 --> 00:04:55.812]  One more TSA story.
[00:04:56.292 --> 00:04:59.955]  Mike Adams came out with this amazing commercial.
[00:05:00.355 --> 00:05:02.076]  I guess they dug it up somewhere on the internet.
[00:05:02.537 --> 00:05:09.001]  The TSA is out there looking for pot-bellied pedophiles to join their ranks.
[00:05:09.322 --> 00:05:10.823]  Let's just go to the clip.
[00:05:12.851 --> 00:05:13.552]  Wanted!
[00:05:13.832 --> 00:05:18.556]  The TSA needs your help to protect America's national security!
[00:05:19.036 --> 00:05:24.220]  As a lightly trained TSA officer, you'll get a plastic badge!
[00:05:24.461 --> 00:05:25.001]  Oh yeah!
[00:05:25.301 --> 00:05:26.322]  You rock!
[00:05:26.522 --> 00:05:27.583]  But that's not all!
[00:05:27.883 --> 00:05:29.685]  No education needed!
[00:05:29.925 --> 00:05:31.747]  No IQ too low!
[00:05:32.347 --> 00:05:41.214]  So if you want your plastic badge, there's a job out there waiting for you, and they're hiring.
[00:05:53.806 --> 00:05:55.667]  So go check out the article on Natural News.
[00:05:55.727 --> 00:06:01.351]  TSA help wanted comedy animation video causes ROFL pandemic across the internet.
[00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:03.432]  Warrant CDC.
[00:06:04.052 --> 00:06:06.494]  It's a satire piece, guys, but check it out.
[00:06:06.514 --> 00:06:09.616]  Pass it on to your friends and it's just plain funny.
[00:06:09.636 --> 00:06:10.876]  We're going to play the whole thing tomorrow night.
[00:06:10.956 --> 00:06:12.517]  Mike Adams will actually be hosting.
[00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:19.422]  He's going to give you the whole scoop behind the scenes, why they did it, how they did it, the people involved in it, whatnot.
[00:06:19.442 --> 00:06:20.222]  So that'll be tomorrow.
[00:06:20.242 --> 00:06:21.283]  We'll play the whole thing for you.
[00:06:21.983 --> 00:06:28.911]  Moving on, Ron Paul military donations, twice those of his GOP rivals and Obama combined.
[00:06:29.231 --> 00:06:29.912]  Oh my goodness.
[00:06:30.092 --> 00:06:38.002]  Not a surprise because we've reported on this before in the third quarter, in the second quarter, back in 2008, and from Business Wire.
[00:06:39.466 --> 00:06:46.517]  A veteran of the Cold War era, Paul raised more than $150,000 from active military in the fourth quarter.
[00:06:46.538 --> 00:06:53.328]  This comes after congressmen outraised all GOP candidates, including all GOP-ers combined, and President Obama.
[00:06:54.195 --> 00:06:56.156]  That was in the second and third quarters of last year.
[00:06:57.176 --> 00:06:59.317]  And it also mentions that he did it in 2008.
[00:06:59.537 --> 00:07:00.378]  So what does that tell you?
[00:07:00.738 --> 00:07:05.280]  The people that are fighting your wars don't want to be fighting them if it's for the wrong reasons.
[00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.682]  They really don't want to be out there killing brown people and dirt farmers and other parts of the world.
[00:07:10.082 --> 00:07:19.086]  What they want to be doing is defending America from true enemies, foreign and domestic, which are a lot of the giant banks here in the United States.
[00:07:19.726 --> 00:07:20.607]  Moving on to Nevada.
[00:07:21.738 --> 00:07:26.019]  Paul Camp Cries Fraud Over Nevada Caucus Results.
[00:07:26.059 --> 00:07:28.200]  And this is from TheExaminer.com.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:34.642]  And this kind of goes with our whole saying of the media telling you Ron Paul can't win.
[00:07:35.383 --> 00:07:36.383]  And this is very interesting.
[00:07:36.443 --> 00:07:37.523]  It goes through a timetable.
[00:07:37.984 --> 00:07:40.644]  Let's go to the first quote, which takes place at 1.30 a.m.
[00:07:42.265 --> 00:07:45.829]  CNN and Precinct Captain revealed the results of the second count.
[00:07:45.869 --> 00:07:54.117]  This time Ron Paul's count was roughly 183, 58% of the precinct's overall vote, to Mitt Romney's 45, Newt Gingrich's 20, and Santorum's 8.
[00:07:54.377 --> 00:07:55.198]  These are votes.
[00:07:57.265 --> 00:08:01.766]  If the media wasn't blacking out the coverage now, we could actually share these actual numbers with our readers.
[00:08:02.246 --> 00:08:10.908]  Paul supporters are ecstatic knowing that they won overwhelmingly in a precinct of Jewish and extremely Christian voters, two of Paul's worst demographics.
[00:08:11.528 --> 00:08:16.989]  In fact, CNN interest polls showed that Ron Paul won overwhelmingly among voters who weren't religious.
[00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:18.310]  Let's move on to 135.
[00:08:20.595 --> 00:08:25.321]  Your author and thousands of other Ron Paul supporters are still waiting to be able to do a simple math deduction.
[00:08:25.761 --> 00:08:33.370]  That if Ron Paul won 58% of the vote in Clark County, and that was representative of his performance countywide, he should have won Nevada easily.
[00:08:34.398 --> 00:08:43.941]  If he won 58% of the vote with 53% outstanding in that county compared to Mitt Romney's 47, so it should have been a Ron Paul win, right?
[00:08:44.161 --> 00:08:54.844]  Well, at 145, CNN blacks out election coverage, shutting down the studio without so much as a word or explanation or warning, switching to human interest stories with an afternoon anchor for 10 minutes.
[00:08:55.444 --> 00:09:06.208]  The network shut all live coverage completely, opting instead to rebroadcast the entire night's early evening coverage, where they were reporting on a Romney victory with merely 3% of the vote.
[00:09:07.248 --> 00:09:08.088]  So we have a clip.
[00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:20.353]  Somebody shot this off YouTube, and this is basically the results of that particular caucus, which of course is not indicative of the rest of Nevada, because those people completely didn't vote the way these people did.
[00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:21.073]  Here's the results.
[00:09:22.122 --> 00:09:24.043]  But here's what happened, Don.
[00:09:24.063 --> 00:09:25.705]  Here's the final count.
[00:09:26.185 --> 00:09:33.290]  183 for Ron Paul, 61 for Mitt Romney, 57 for Newt Gingrich, and 16 for Rick Santorum.
[00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.632]  Behind me right now, these are Republican Party officials from Clark County.
[00:09:36.992 --> 00:09:39.334]  You can see the votes are right over there, right above those boxes.
[00:09:39.354 --> 00:09:47.880]  They're going to take them downtown to the party HQ, and they're going to be added to the county totals, and then, of course, they'll be added to the total totals for the state.
[00:09:49.181 --> 00:10:00.747]  So he's got an overwhelming win in this one precinct where he wasn't even supposed to be doing that good with Jewish and Catholic voters, yet the rest of Nevada magically votes for Mitt Romney.
[00:10:01.127 --> 00:10:02.208]  So old Mittens wins.
[00:10:02.248 --> 00:10:04.969]  And here's another interesting thing we found on a Facebook post.
[00:10:05.109 --> 00:10:05.990]  We'll go to this graph.
[00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.052]  And it shows the percentages of Ron Paul from 2008 to 2012.
[00:10:09.132 --> 00:10:14.878]  He's got a 120% increase in Iowa, a 210% increase in New Hampshire, a 385% increase in South Carolina, an 86% increase in Florida, oh in Nevada only a 1.4% increase.
[00:10:14.898 --> 00:10:15.518]  And this is a place where
[00:10:29.992 --> 00:10:38.955]  If you remember back in 2008, they actually shut down the primary because there were so many Ron Paul supporters there, and they were wanting to vote Ron Paul in.
[00:10:38.975 --> 00:10:43.237]  They were wanting to give him the delegates, even though I think technically Minton's won the caucus.
[00:10:43.257 --> 00:10:50.419]  But Ron Paul had his people in, they went through the process, and then it gets to the end, and the Republican establishment just shut it down.
[00:10:50.439 --> 00:10:52.600]  I think we have an article here over on the big screen.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.201]  So here we are back in 2008.
[00:10:55.581 --> 00:10:58.983]  Ron Paul backers outmaneuver Nevada GOP establishment.
[00:10:59.123 --> 00:11:05.407]  Outmaneuvered by raucous Ron Paul supporters, Nevada Republican Party leaders shut down their weekend state convention.
[00:11:06.287 --> 00:11:11.930]  And so then they went ahead and what they did was have it in a secret area and then gave the vote to Mitt Romney.
[00:11:12.331 --> 00:11:16.753]  So that's the kind of stuff that's going to keep happening to Ron Paul over and over again as we go through.
[00:11:16.813 --> 00:11:20.415]  Now they're kind of predicting that Santorum is going to somehow win in Minnesota.
[00:11:20.755 --> 00:11:21.616]  Yeah, right.
[00:11:22.196 --> 00:11:26.798]  If you believe that, I've got a bridge to nowhere in Alaska to sell you.
[00:11:27.578 --> 00:11:32.360]  Moving on to this weird, weird story out of Virginia.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.461]  Judge sets trial date in Loughton School, Tardiness.
[00:11:36.802 --> 00:11:39.863]  And this has to do with Amy and Mark Dinacore.
[00:11:40.683 --> 00:11:46.005]  They have to go to a full-blown trial to defend themselves for their daughter who's been late to school too often.
[00:11:46.025 --> 00:11:47.106]  This is elementary school.
[00:11:48.584 --> 00:11:54.629]  The Decores are each charged with three Class 3 misdemeanors, each of which carries a maximum $500 fine.
[00:11:54.649 --> 00:12:00.374]  Their three children, ages 6, 7, and 9, have been late to school almost 30 times since September.
[00:12:00.814 --> 00:12:03.416]  Most of their tardies were three minutes or less.
[00:12:03.896 --> 00:12:05.958]  Well, I mean, what does that tell you?
[00:12:06.358 --> 00:12:17.868]  You can't have a robotic generation of people that are yes-men and yes-women who are going to pull the line for these giant corporations if they're three minutes late from school.
[00:12:20.347 --> 00:12:25.028]  You might have to waste a bunch of people's time and money bringing them to trial, which is what they're doing here.
[00:12:25.068 --> 00:12:29.550]  We're actually trying to get Mark on the show today, and we think we're going to convince him.
[00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:32.430]  If you know Mark out there, tell him we're on his side.
[00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:33.371]  We want him on the show.
[00:12:33.991 --> 00:12:37.552]  It says here they're charged under the state's compulsory education law.
[00:12:38.547 --> 00:12:44.308]  Which says parents have to send their kids to school for the same number of days and hours per day as school is in session.
[00:12:45.208 --> 00:12:54.750]  Another statute clearly spells out how school systems must proceed in the case of chronic absences when there's no indication that the pupil's parent is aware and supports the pupil's absence.
[00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:57.131]  Of course, none of it specifies tardiness.
[00:12:57.151 --> 00:13:01.692]  That's just another little glitch that they want to use to try to control people's lives.
[00:13:02.992 --> 00:13:03.832]  And it's disgusting.
[00:13:05.106 --> 00:13:11.530]  So moving on, last night I actually ran across this book and it made me think of this book.
[00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:20.815]  Back in the late 90s, I think it was like 97 or 98, I went to this used bookstore back in Murrysville, Pennsylvania where I used to live.
[00:13:22.108 --> 00:13:23.348]  And I went upstairs and I was looking around.
[00:13:23.368 --> 00:13:24.709]  I wanted to find some good books to read.
[00:13:24.769 --> 00:13:30.630]  I was sick and tired of reading the garbage they were telling me to read in high school, and I'd just started college.
[00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:35.331]  And I ran into, I went upstairs and I found the conspiracy government section.
[00:13:35.351 --> 00:13:37.212]  And I was like, oh, that's interesting.
[00:13:37.252 --> 00:13:38.232]  So I started thumbing around.
[00:13:38.652 --> 00:13:41.473]  And these two books were sitting right next to each other.
[00:13:42.452 --> 00:13:44.894]  Grab the first one, None Dare Call a Conspiracy.
[00:13:45.214 --> 00:13:46.735]  Short book, I'm going to read it.
[00:13:47.355 --> 00:13:48.756]  The next one, Who Runs Congress?
[00:13:49.176 --> 00:13:56.421]  I was already pretty aware in terms of geopolitically that everything's been fixed, everything's a sham.
[00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:58.962]  So I want to just go over these two books with you and I encourage you to read them.
[00:13:59.062 --> 00:13:59.663]  They're great.
[00:14:00.183 --> 00:14:07.966]  Books, even though they were both written in the 70s, early 70s, they're great primers and you will find many events in these books that kind of relate to what's going on today.
[00:14:08.546 --> 00:14:11.067]  So, let's go to None Dare Call a Conspiracy.
[00:14:11.087 --> 00:14:19.050]  They've got a lot of great graphics and pictures in there that kind of explain the kind of overall global hierarchy.
[00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:28.553]  It goes into a little chart of communism versus fascism, shows how the middle class are getting pressure from above and below, shows a whole chart of the world government.
[00:14:29.412 --> 00:14:30.793]  And the companies involved.
[00:14:31.073 --> 00:14:36.097]  Shows members of the CFR including Eisenhower and the Kennedys and Kissinger and Nixon.
[00:14:36.618 --> 00:14:37.859]  Then we go to Paul Warburg.
[00:14:39.013 --> 00:14:44.714]  Who was the main guy for the Federal Reserve into bankrolling the Bolshevik Revolution.
[00:14:44.734 --> 00:14:45.675]  I bet you didn't know that.
[00:14:46.215 --> 00:14:47.775]  We put Trotsky in power.
[00:14:47.815 --> 00:14:49.135]  The Federal Reserve System did.
[00:14:49.795 --> 00:14:52.676]  And then there's a little chart on that about the people who are contributing money.
[00:14:53.056 --> 00:14:54.397]  They're also helping out Hitler.
[00:14:54.417 --> 00:14:55.657]  It's a big scam.
[00:14:56.317 --> 00:14:57.477]  And this book goes into it.
[00:14:57.797 --> 00:15:02.278]  Towards the end, there's a really great section called the 14 Signposts to Slavery.
[00:15:02.298 --> 00:15:04.459]  And I would like to read all 14 of these real quick.
[00:15:05.319 --> 00:15:10.963]  Restrictions on taking money out of the country and establishment or retention of a foreign bank account by an American citizen.
[00:15:11.543 --> 00:15:13.585]  Abolition of private ownership of handguns.
[00:15:14.065 --> 00:15:16.667]  Detention of individuals without judicial process.
[00:15:16.747 --> 00:15:18.208]  Can someone say NDAA?
[00:15:18.868 --> 00:15:28.715]  Requirements that private financial transactions be key to social security numbers or other government identification so that government records of these transactions can be kept and fed into a computer.
[00:15:29.475 --> 00:15:34.699]  Use of compulsory education laws to forbid attendance at presently existing private schools.
[00:15:35.339 --> 00:15:36.139]  Let's go to the next one.
[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.620]  Compulsory non-military service.
[00:15:38.921 --> 00:15:40.101]  Those are your brown shirts.
[00:15:41.322 --> 00:15:43.363]  Or I guess in Obama's case, it's the red shirts.
[00:15:44.063 --> 00:15:47.925]  Compulsory psychological treatment for non-government workers or public school children.
[00:15:48.425 --> 00:15:54.287]  Official declaration that anti-communist organizations are subversive and subsequent legal action taken to suppress them.
[00:15:55.088 --> 00:15:58.249]  Limiting the number of people allowed to meet in a private home.
[00:15:58.569 --> 00:16:02.111]  We've seen that, where people aren't allowed to have little prayer meetings.
[00:16:02.291 --> 00:16:04.472]  And I think that happened in Colorado a few years ago.
[00:16:05.638 --> 00:16:09.541]  Any significant change in passport regulations to make passports more difficult to obtain.
[00:16:09.601 --> 00:16:12.843]  It now takes you over three months to get a passport.
[00:16:14.123 --> 00:16:17.826]  Wage and price controls, essentially in a non-wartime situation.
[00:16:18.566 --> 00:16:22.609]  Any kind of compulsory registration with the government of where individuals are going to work.
[00:16:22.809 --> 00:16:23.689]  And the last two...
[00:16:25.006 --> 00:16:29.171]  Any attempt to restrict the freedom of movement within the United States.
[00:16:29.692 --> 00:16:36.940]  And fourteen, any major attempt to make a new law, a new major law by executive decree.
[00:16:37.441 --> 00:16:40.044]  How many laws have we seen by executive order?
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:41.901]  There you go.
[00:16:42.661 --> 00:16:44.583]  Great book, None Dare Call a Conspiracy.
[00:16:44.743 --> 00:16:46.665]  The next one, Who Runs Congress?
[00:16:46.685 --> 00:16:49.388]  And this is by the Ralph Nader Congress Project.
[00:16:49.448 --> 00:16:54.052]  It's not officially by Nader, but it's by his kind of group.
[00:16:54.452 --> 00:16:57.195]  And I just kind of want to read you a few quotes of this book.
[00:16:58.236 --> 00:16:58.476]  Page 22.
[00:17:00.811 --> 00:17:06.455]  It used to be that corporations helped their candidates and returned for an even larger slice of the government's pie.
[00:17:07.135 --> 00:17:12.018]  Nowadays, many big businesses find they already have as much as they can decorously eat.
[00:17:12.458 --> 00:17:15.240]  Their main concern is to guarantee against shrinkage.
[00:17:15.841 --> 00:17:16.421]  That was on page 22.
[00:17:16.481 --> 00:17:21.484]  The next one on page 48.
[00:17:22.004 --> 00:17:25.587]  The House in some ways isn't very representative.
[00:17:26.411 --> 00:17:29.853]  There's almost never anyone here under 30, and of course there are only 9 blacks.
[00:17:29.873 --> 00:17:30.533]  This was in 1969.
[00:17:30.973 --> 00:17:33.995]  And proportionally, there should be about 50.
[00:17:34.815 --> 00:17:39.578]  There's a disproportionate representation, even more skewed for women and blue collar workers.
[00:17:39.838 --> 00:17:41.719]  So unless you're a millionaire, you're not getting in.
[00:17:43.868 --> 00:17:44.088]  Page 55.
[00:17:44.788 --> 00:17:51.390]  It would be risky, and this is talking about committees and how they don't put freshmen in the heads of committees.
[00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:53.311]  They kind of keep them off so they can see how they work.
[00:17:53.351 --> 00:17:54.031]  Here's the quote.
[00:17:54.731 --> 00:18:00.613]  It would be too risky to put on a person whose views and nature the leadership has no opportunity to assess.
[00:18:01.293 --> 00:18:02.514]  That's what the FBI agents like to do.
[00:18:02.554 --> 00:18:03.574]  They like to assess you.
[00:18:04.354 --> 00:18:08.115]  A careful screening ensures that nonconformists do not slip through.
[00:18:08.655 --> 00:18:13.357]  So they want to make sure that the right guys are in there to keep the policies going as they are.
[00:18:15.376 --> 00:18:16.057]  Moving on to page 91.
[00:18:16.197 --> 00:18:18.178]  It's about liberals.
[00:18:18.578 --> 00:18:27.545]  The average liberal thinks up what he or she wants to do and then runs off to somebody else to ask, what procedural step do I take in order to do this?
[00:18:27.625 --> 00:18:32.208]  Consequently, liberals rarely get anything significantly accomplished.
[00:18:32.368 --> 00:18:34.250]  I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing.
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.782]  Here's an interesting quote from page 94.
[00:18:37.902 --> 00:18:45.967]  In the last two decades, roughly 80% of the major laws passed have started in the executive branch.
[00:18:46.948 --> 00:18:47.308]  Okay?
[00:18:47.749 --> 00:18:49.910]  That's not the representatives writing the laws.
[00:18:50.651 --> 00:18:51.832]  That's the president
[00:18:52.884 --> 00:18:56.946]  Writing stuff through executive order, which is pretty much like a dictatorship.
[00:18:56.966 --> 00:18:58.087]  And this is back in the 70s.
[00:18:58.427 --> 00:19:00.948]  Here's a very interesting quote about lobbyists.
[00:19:01.449 --> 00:19:14.676]  A 1913 law, the Executive Anti-Lobbying Act, says that no funds may be used to influence in any manner a member of Congress to favor or oppose by vote or otherwise any legislation or appropriation by Congress.
[00:19:15.276 --> 00:19:22.261]  The only exception is that executive agents may communicate with members of Congress on request through the proper channels.
[00:19:22.562 --> 00:19:26.625]  So by creating this little loophole, we have the problems that we have now.
[00:19:27.005 --> 00:19:29.127]  So I would encourage you, check out these two books.
[00:19:29.347 --> 00:19:30.147]  They woke me up.
[00:19:30.968 --> 00:19:34.470]  Way back in the 90s, if you can remember that far, and they can do the same for you.
[00:19:36.411 --> 00:19:39.092]  Moving on to our Mother Earth.
[00:19:40.152 --> 00:19:41.473]  This is out of Climate Depot.
[00:19:41.513 --> 00:19:52.598]  They put together a compilation of a bunch of UN's sustainable development efforts, and the article is, read all about it, Climate Depot's Roundup of UN Sustainable Development Efforts.
[00:19:53.218 --> 00:19:55.520]  UN officially throws global warming under the bus.
[00:19:55.860 --> 00:20:00.242]  UN now says case for saving species more powerful than climate change.
[00:20:01.963 --> 00:20:03.584]  And there's a whole bunch of articles there.
[00:20:04.164 --> 00:20:06.766]  Alex is going to be up with Mark Morano talking about this.
[00:20:07.266 --> 00:20:15.891]  One of the articles in there in particular, which was interesting, was, CO2 causes contempt for childhood, a climate well worthy of our alarm.
[00:20:16.051 --> 00:20:29.058]  When children less than six years old are seen as instruments for the achievement of sustainable society, and that we must make them understand deeply and even shock them out of their unawareness, then something is seriously amiss.
[00:20:29.858 --> 00:20:32.541]  Somebody somewhere is up to something we should resist.
[00:20:33.282 --> 00:20:34.983]  And that's a quote from a UNESCO report.
[00:20:35.384 --> 00:20:40.709]  And it was recently reported on by Donna LaFrombosi.
[00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:42.491]  Very interesting article.
[00:20:42.972 --> 00:20:43.412]  Check it out.
[00:20:43.452 --> 00:20:47.636]  It's got a lot of interesting information on how they're trying to brainwash the kids into thinking they're bad.
[00:20:49.162 --> 00:20:54.283]  Our final article of the day is from the San Francisco Gate, and it has to do with red light cameras.
[00:20:55.303 --> 00:20:59.304]  You may recall a couple years ago, they actually beat these in Phoenix, Arizona.
[00:20:59.324 --> 00:21:06.766]  A lot of the Freedom's Phoenix people, 4409, those guys, if you check them out on YouTube, they made a lot of good videos going against this.
[00:21:07.206 --> 00:21:08.946]  But here we go in San Francisco.
[00:21:09.626 --> 00:21:18.448]  Anyone in California snapped violating a red light pays a fine of $480, and according to a traffic watch site, thenewspaper.com,
[00:21:19.148 --> 00:21:22.170]  No other jurisdiction anywhere has that high of a tab.
[00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:26.673]  The second highest fine in the United States is $250, and usually it's more around $100.
[00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:34.537]  The legislature passed two bills in the past two years that would have reduced the fine or limited the camera's use, but both were vetoed.
[00:21:35.198 --> 00:21:40.381]  When he killed the most recent measure, Governor Jerry Brown said that matter should be left up to local jurisdictions.
[00:21:41.782 --> 00:21:48.446]  So basically, the local authorities are going to be able to loot you as much as they want with their expensive red light cameras that usually
[00:21:49.505 --> 00:21:56.189]  More often than not are getting people for making right on reds or making a stop and then going through.
[00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:58.271]  All kind of weird stuff there.
[00:21:58.291 --> 00:22:00.252]  I don't know.
[00:22:00.272 --> 00:22:03.254]  If I get one sent home from a camera, I'm not paying it.
[00:22:03.554 --> 00:22:04.274]  There's no way.
[00:22:04.615 --> 00:22:09.298]  There has to be somebody there witnessing the fact I have to sign something that says I'm going to appear in court.
[00:22:10.265 --> 00:22:16.747]  So anyway, moving on, we're going to go to our quote of the day, and then we'll be back after this break with Alex Jones talking with Mark Morano.
[00:22:16.787 --> 00:22:19.367]  And this is from, actually, Who Runs Congress?
[00:22:19.447 --> 00:22:22.908]  And it's the start of Chapter 5, and it's from Mark Twain.
[00:22:24.169 --> 00:22:32.811]  And the quote is, It could probably be shown by facts and figures that there is no distinctly American criminal class except Congress.
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.541]  That's by Mark Twain.
[00:22:35.561 --> 00:22:41.744]  That was way back in the day, probably in the late 1800s, that he wrote that quote.
[00:22:42.965 --> 00:22:44.366]  And what can you say?
[00:22:44.406 --> 00:22:53.572]  They were criminals back then, they're criminals now, and they're criminals investigating criminals, so therefore you're never going to see any charges filed, especially with stuff like Fast and Furious.
[00:22:53.932 --> 00:22:59.095]  That's why no one's gone to jail from the 2008 banking crisis, except for Bernie Madoff.
[00:22:59.135 --> 00:22:59.836]  He's the only guy.
[00:23:01.038 --> 00:23:06.763]  Well, with that, I would like to encourage you, if you're watching this on YouTube, to subscribe to Prison Planet TV and become a member.
[00:23:07.323 --> 00:23:08.964]  We have a great system now going.
[00:23:09.004 --> 00:23:15.049]  You have a 15-day free trial, or you can actually give a gift to a friend for a card, and you get 44% off.
[00:23:15.089 --> 00:23:20.033]  It's Give the Gift of Truth, and that's only $44.95 for a full year.
[00:23:20.514 --> 00:23:26.719]  We're doing this five nights a week, and we're going to keep on doing it until we stop the globalists.
[00:23:27.608 --> 00:23:28.290]  That's all for me.
[00:23:28.391 --> 00:23:29.835]  Alex will be up next with Martin Marano.
[00:23:30.156 --> 00:23:30.938]  Thank you for watching.
[00:23:30.958 --> 00:23:32.403]  This is InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:40.971]  Greetings, fellow InfoWarriors.
[00:23:41.612 --> 00:23:49.336]  Alex Jones here, announcing the first of many trips that I'm going to take across this wonderful United States that we live in.
[00:23:49.637 --> 00:23:59.563]  And we get so busy here at InfoWars.com, the nightly news, the daily radio show, the documentary films, and all the other things we're doing that I tend to never go out and give speeches anymore.
[00:23:59.983 --> 00:24:03.706]  And I've got a lot of ideas bubbling around in my head about the history of the New World Order.
[00:24:03.986 --> 00:24:05.387]  What makes them tick and how to defeat them.
[00:24:05.688 --> 00:24:08.069]  So I'm titling this key speech I'm going to give.
[00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:10.271]  It'll run around two hours long.
[00:24:10.892 --> 00:24:12.673]  Blueprint to Defeat the New World Order.
[00:24:12.953 --> 00:24:18.698]  And we're also going to have a surprise premiere of a short documentary film we've been working on at the event.
[00:24:19.138 --> 00:24:21.240]  First off, I'm going to be going to Dallas, Texas.
[00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:23.201]  Sunday, February 19th, 2012.
[00:24:23.361 --> 00:24:26.064]  To the historic Lakewood Theater.
[00:24:26.644 --> 00:24:30.853]  And the next Sunday, February 26th, I'm going to be in Orlando, Florida.
[00:24:31.514 --> 00:24:37.186]  You can find out more about the events and buy tickets at infowars.com forward slash events.
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.562]  Now unfortunately, every event I've ever had, we've had to turn people away.
[00:24:42.183 --> 00:24:46.025]  So get your tickets early at InfoWars.com forward slash events.
[00:24:46.045 --> 00:24:48.347]  There's a lot of crazy stuff going on in this world.
[00:24:49.047 --> 00:24:51.589]  The craziest of all is this explosive awakening.
[00:24:52.269 --> 00:24:54.030]  I can't wait to meet you and shake your hand.
[00:24:54.471 --> 00:24:56.452]  I'll see you in Dallas and I'll see you in Orlando.
[00:24:57.113 --> 00:24:59.054]  InfoWars.com forward slash events.
[00:25:07.538 --> 00:25:12.041]  Yeah, I'm signing these evil 1776 flags.
[00:25:12.682 --> 00:25:19.626]  Doesn't get any more out of control than that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:20.647 --> 00:25:23.129]  It's pretty un-American what we're doing here at InfoWars.com.
[00:25:23.289 --> 00:25:31.575]  I mean, not only are we promoting liberty, but we're selling 1776 flags.
[00:25:31.595 --> 00:25:33.076]  Now that...
[00:25:34.913 --> 00:25:36.514]  Please don't kill her.
[00:25:53.154 --> 00:25:58.080]  That was amazing information before we went to break that Rob Dew was covering.
[00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:10.455]  The fact that Ron Paul has gained in every single state since 2008 except in Nevada and now the evidence of election fraud is just pouring in just like Iowa.
[00:26:10.475 --> 00:26:10.975]  This is just...
[00:26:11.676 --> 00:26:16.317]  It just shows how systemic corruption and fraud is across the board in government, you name it.
[00:26:16.857 --> 00:26:34.460]  Now speaking of fraud, Mark Moreno is somebody who's been exposing fraud and he of course heads up the biggest site in the world out there exposing the climate fraudsters, the gangsters that want to tax you for breathing and reduce CO2 that plants live off of and that humans exhale.
[00:26:34.981 --> 00:26:36.481]  He's the former communications director for
[00:26:37.601 --> 00:26:43.023]  Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and senior aide to, of course, Senator James Inhofe.
[00:26:43.824 --> 00:26:53.388]  But if two or three years ago the whole Copenhagen thing going down in flames was a big deal, you know, the Death Star blowing up, this is the end of the empire.
[00:26:53.768 --> 00:26:57.170]  I mean, the whole system is in free fall.
[00:26:57.250 --> 00:27:01.532]  Scientists are coming out, governments are coming out saying, man-made global warming is a fraud.
[00:27:02.972 --> 00:27:04.254]  Current TV's in trouble.
[00:27:04.434 --> 00:27:05.375]  Al Gore's in trouble.
[00:27:05.695 --> 00:27:06.976]  I mean, across the board.
[00:27:07.056 --> 00:27:08.037]  But something's happening.
[00:27:09.098 --> 00:27:12.881]  Like Schwarzenegger said they do three years ago, they're focusing on counties, cities, and states.
[00:27:13.262 --> 00:27:18.226]  Here in Austin, they announced two weeks ago, 20 to 80 percent hikes on energy.
[00:27:18.467 --> 00:27:20.669]  And they said, for the Earth, we're going to charge you more.
[00:27:21.465 --> 00:27:29.169]  Just for the earth and private companies, like GE that work for Obama, they get to shut down other power plants and then they charge you more for less.
[00:27:29.789 --> 00:27:42.496]  So, it's entering just la-la land, but even all the trendy liberals that like to flog themselves and get into, you know, being poor and how it's fun to live under austerity to the mega banks, they're even getting angry.
[00:27:43.057 --> 00:27:47.379]  So, there's this weird dichotomy now, or this paradox, where
[00:27:48.885 --> 00:27:52.930]  They're in free fall, losing all credibility, but they're announcing their global government.
[00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:55.773]  Ban Ki-moon two days ago said, I want world government.
[00:27:56.354 --> 00:28:05.904]  The New York Times came out and said crazy people think there's a world government with the UN and Agenda 21, but then admitted Agenda 21's real out of the Earth Summit 20 years ago.
[00:28:06.485 --> 00:28:10.808]  And Mark Moreno, he's going in a month or so to the big Rio summit.
[00:28:11.169 --> 00:28:13.130]  So just incredible what's happening.
[00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:16.653]  I don't want to say they're dead, but their system's in trouble.
[00:28:16.693 --> 00:28:18.274]  But they're still power grabbing.
[00:28:18.474 --> 00:28:19.775]  They're still in charge everywhere.
[00:28:20.035 --> 00:28:24.039]  So the expert on this joins us from climatedepot.com.
[00:28:24.079 --> 00:28:26.100]  Mark, thank you for spending time with us today.
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:31.805]  I know you're back on the radio tomorrow for a more extended interview, but break down what's happening here.
[00:28:32.645 --> 00:28:33.166]  Well, let's just see.
[00:28:33.186 --> 00:28:34.367]  Well, I'll start with Al Gore.
[00:28:34.407 --> 00:28:35.888]  We're at the point now where Current TV,
[00:28:36.858 --> 00:28:38.380]  Which never really got off the ground.
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:48.511]  Al Gore is begging, pleading, cajoling Keith Oberman to stay around as the only vestige of a recognizable face that will affiliate themselves with his dying network.
[00:28:48.972 --> 00:28:49.652]  It is so bad.
[00:28:49.673 --> 00:28:57.021]  Al Gore, in his 24-hour climate of reality, or I can't remember now if it was 48 or 72 hour, back in this last fall,
[00:28:57.561 --> 00:29:00.404]  And the Global Warmists attacked Al Gore or ignored him.
[00:29:00.424 --> 00:29:01.265]  They were cringing.
[00:29:01.546 --> 00:29:05.370]  Al Gore is being cast out by the very movement that built him up.
[00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:14.560]  In another case in point, Al Gore traveled down to Antarctica with Richard Branson and some other Global Warmist scientists this past week and the media yawned.
[00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:16.903]  Other than Huffington Post, no one covered it.
[00:29:17.123 --> 00:29:18.785]  And Al Gore's own blog post
[00:29:18.985 --> 00:29:19.946]  Couldn't even get up alarm.
[00:29:19.986 --> 00:29:20.527]  You know why?
[00:29:20.547 --> 00:29:22.890]  Because Antarctica has been gaining ice.
[00:29:23.151 --> 00:29:25.113]  The bulk of Antarctica has been cooling.
[00:29:25.654 --> 00:29:28.498]  Al Gore failed to even spin himself.
[00:29:28.758 --> 00:29:33.204]  His own blog posts were so dull on Antarctica and the media ignored him.
[00:29:33.424 --> 00:29:35.167]  So Al Gore is getting the ultimate.
[00:29:35.407 --> 00:29:36.088]  He's not getting...
[00:29:37.217 --> 00:29:39.499]  He's not even being attacked, he's being ignored.
[00:29:39.559 --> 00:29:42.100]  It's a shocking development, just to begin with Al Gore.
[00:29:42.361 --> 00:29:49.525]  Beyond that, you mentioned in Germany, global warming, major global warming scientists are reversing themselves, becoming skeptical.
[00:29:49.765 --> 00:29:58.471]  The major German media, Der Spiegel and others, it's my headline at Climate Depot, they're covering this shockingly and showing the people, they're calling them CO2 lies.
[00:29:58.791 --> 00:30:00.773]  The German media is waking up.
[00:30:00.853 --> 00:30:04.075]  Who would have ever thought you would see this day that it's happening?
[00:30:04.655 --> 00:30:26.100]  I released a report a few months ago down when I was in Durban at the UN Conference, the A to Z climate reality report, and it's all coming true from A to Z. They're failing on all their predictions and now we have the United Nations directly stating that the case for species extinction and sustainable development is more alarming than climate change.
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.420]  The United Nations
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:28.440]  We're good to go.
[00:30:42.777 --> 00:30:46.079]  It's a global EPA, and this idea came out of France.
[00:30:46.099 --> 00:30:48.420]  They claim it was 100 nations going to support it.
[00:30:48.741 --> 00:30:52.583]  A global environmental organization that's going to be able to police the world.
[00:30:52.643 --> 00:30:56.425]  Think of our own EPA that speaks French.
[00:30:56.485 --> 00:30:59.507]  If that doesn't send chills up your spine, I don't know what will.
[00:31:00.484 --> 00:31:10.650]  Wow, and I also saw, even in the New York Times a few weeks ago, a whole bunch of top scientists sent letters saying global warming is overblown and a fraud, and they even published it.
[00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:14.212]  So clearly they are trying to kill this discredited fraud.
[00:31:14.232 --> 00:31:20.455]  Kind of like in the 70s they said we'd all be frozen by 2000 and give the Club of Rome money and shut off development.
[00:31:20.835 --> 00:31:23.137]  Really it's about the monopoly men, the eugenicists.
[00:31:23.777 --> 00:31:34.900]  Having control of society, but it's the same UN fraudsters that everybody knows is attached to this, just as they roll out a bunch of bull about species extinction when they're finding hundreds of new species every month.
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.020]  I was just reading the other day.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.660]  I mean, that fear-mongering isn't going to sell.
[00:31:39.881 --> 00:31:41.001]  So can you speak to that?
[00:31:41.041 --> 00:31:47.242]  But then I want to expand into the fact that, well, okay, they're exposed, but they're not going away.
[00:31:47.782 --> 00:31:49.663]  They're just sitting there still ruling us.
[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:53.642]  Yes, in fact, you know, before my species, you mentioned global cooling.
[00:31:54.143 --> 00:31:57.485]  It's the same solutions, regardless of the environmental problem.
[00:31:57.826 --> 00:32:07.193]  When they were talking about global cooling in the 1970s, you could actually pull out direct quotes about how we need more power and control, scientists need to geo-engineer the climate.
[00:32:07.333 --> 00:32:11.296]  They were talking about pouring black soot on the ice caps so that it wouldn't grow.
[00:32:12.116 --> 00:32:17.281]  They were talking about how tipping points, we must act now before it's too late to prevent man-made global cooling.
[00:32:17.681 --> 00:32:21.624]  So, and then they shifted there over into deforestation.
[00:32:21.644 --> 00:32:24.446]  They saved the Amazon, the tropical rainforest.
[00:32:24.466 --> 00:32:26.048]  That was huge for decades.
[00:32:26.208 --> 00:32:28.510]  And they propagandized kids with that as well.
[00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:29.831]  And then that fades away.
[00:32:29.851 --> 00:32:30.932]  Then they bring up global warming.
[00:32:30.952 --> 00:32:34.615]  Before that, we had overpopulation back in the late 60s and the 1970s.
[00:32:34.835 --> 00:32:37.417]  And as we mentioned, John Lennon, the ex-Beatle,
[00:32:38.218 --> 00:32:48.008]  Actually is the one who ridiculed Dick Cavett on his TV show and made a chump out of Obama's science advisor John Holdren and said overpopulation was overblown.
[00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:53.314]  So if you go back, every eco scare is designed for regulation and control.
[00:32:53.394 --> 00:32:56.397]  It doesn't matter what the actual science is behind it.
[00:32:56.737 --> 00:32:57.138]  Right now,
[00:32:57.678 --> 00:33:03.961]  Species extinction is going to be one of the biggest things everyone hears about between now and June at this next UN conference.
[00:33:04.321 --> 00:33:06.743]  And they are coming out with all sorts of wacky claims.
[00:33:07.003 --> 00:33:13.166]  They'll claim that 50,000 species are going extinct every year, when in reality, they can't even name the species.
[00:33:13.186 --> 00:33:17.768]  They're actually electrons in the hard drives of the computer model.
[00:33:17.788 --> 00:33:18.869]  They're potential species.
[00:33:19.489 --> 00:33:23.193]  That may exist, but they haven't actually discovered them yet, and they may be going extinct.
[00:33:23.213 --> 00:33:29.019]  So species we don't even know about, theoretically might be going extinct, and they've turned this into a species holocaust.
[00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:35.887]  And I have scientists, including the founder, co-founder of Greenpeace, Patrick Moore, who's done guest columns at Climate Depot, just
[00:33:36.528 --> 00:33:45.350]  Tearing apart all these new species claims, and they have a panel like the United Nations Climate Panel, an IPCC-like panel devoted to species.
[00:33:45.631 --> 00:33:51.472]  And what they've found is they have just as many errors, there's just as much politics, there's just as much fraud involved in that as well.
[00:33:51.512 --> 00:33:57.814]  So be ready for the Species Brigade from the United Nations to be pouring it on in the media in the next few months.
[00:33:58.374 --> 00:34:00.395]  So that's their new attack, which is an old one.
[00:34:00.435 --> 00:34:14.999]  Here in Austin, with Save Our Springs, they took tens of thousands of acres from ranchers and farmers, adverse possession, a few cents on the dollar, and then the very environmental groups turned around and built hotels and million-dollar ranchettes and sold it.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:19.861]  And they said it was for a golden sheik warbler bird that's just all over the place.
[00:34:20.521 --> 00:34:24.985]  They've been caught planting, different groups as you know, cave bugs in areas to shut them down.
[00:34:25.365 --> 00:34:26.907]  Planting kangaroo rats.
[00:34:27.427 --> 00:34:34.293]  They've been caught planting different species, what the EPA got caught planting birds in Colorado.
[00:34:34.313 --> 00:34:34.754]  Remember that?
[00:34:35.134 --> 00:34:39.338]  I mean, they're constantly getting caught and really they're just mafias.
[00:34:39.358 --> 00:34:41.079]  These aren't even well-meaning environmentalists.
[00:34:41.399 --> 00:34:44.963]  I mean, Mark, from your research, aren't these just criminal land grabbers?
[00:34:45.643 --> 00:34:51.005]  Yeah, this is all about bureaucratic bean counters, and it's about people with other agendas behind the scene.
[00:34:51.245 --> 00:34:56.867]  In the 1990s, I covered the alleged endangered desert tortoise on a mining operation in the Mojave Desert.
[00:34:56.887 --> 00:35:03.889]  It's actually a rare earth mineral, lanthanide, that we need for catalytic converters and other things, and this is something
[00:35:04.869 --> 00:35:07.951]  That they actually claimed that the desert tortoise was endangered.
[00:35:07.971 --> 00:35:08.672]  Well, we looked it up.
[00:35:08.732 --> 00:35:10.653]  I had a biologist there and we studied it.
[00:35:11.193 --> 00:35:17.817]  On the scene in the Mojave Desert, it turns out the endangered tortoise, I'm sorry, the desert tortoise, was not an endangered species.
[00:35:18.077 --> 00:35:26.803]  But around the edges of its habitat, it literally, where all species have less of them, they declare the edges of their natural habitat an endangered area.
[00:35:26.983 --> 00:35:28.584]  So, it was regionally endangered.
[00:35:28.784 --> 00:35:33.887]  In other words, the species itself was doing fine, but because the mine was in an area that was at the edge of the habitat,
[00:35:34.307 --> 00:35:36.229]  Of the desert tortoise.
[00:35:36.249 --> 00:35:37.910]  They declared it an endangered species.
[00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:39.692]  You can do that with any animal.
[00:35:40.252 --> 00:35:41.833]  Let's take polar bears.
[00:35:41.893 --> 00:35:43.155]  Anybody can look this up.
[00:35:43.535 --> 00:35:46.377]  But depending on the number, they've increased three to five times.
[00:35:46.417 --> 00:35:47.718]  The Russians say five times.
[00:35:48.139 --> 00:35:49.240]  Canada says four times.
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:49.580]  U.S.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.841]  says three and a half times, as you know.
[00:35:51.101 --> 00:35:52.142]  This is all on record.
[00:35:52.522 --> 00:35:58.467]  Al Gore thinks we're so dumb, he shows animations of a baby polar bear that can't swim and is going to drown.
[00:35:58.908 --> 00:35:59.768]  This is how dumb...
[00:36:00.729 --> 00:36:03.411]  The numbers have exploded all over Canada.
[00:36:03.451 --> 00:36:07.353]  They're robbing people's trash, killing people, killing family dogs.
[00:36:07.373 --> 00:36:08.914]  They're running around like roaches.
[00:36:09.294 --> 00:36:11.155]  Bald eagles in some areas.
[00:36:11.255 --> 00:36:12.516]  I saw one just the other day.
[00:36:12.756 --> 00:36:14.317]  There's bald eagles all over the place.
[00:36:14.537 --> 00:36:15.898]  They're telling you there's no bald eagles.
[00:36:16.218 --> 00:36:17.519]  Let us take your property.
[00:36:17.819 --> 00:36:19.601]  I mean, it's so transparent.
[00:36:20.041 --> 00:36:22.662]  Now they've gone through these frauds over and over again.
[00:36:23.303 --> 00:36:24.724]  Is it ever going to come to an end?
[00:36:25.024 --> 00:36:26.245]  Is there any way to route them?
[00:36:26.465 --> 00:36:27.485]  Take Austin, Texas.
[00:36:27.846 --> 00:36:29.707]  I mean, it is a criminal cabal.
[00:36:30.307 --> 00:36:35.253]  Who rules and steals whatever they want and says, we're charging you more, it's for the earth.
[00:36:35.353 --> 00:36:36.895]  I mean, how do I stop them?
[00:36:37.356 --> 00:36:38.737]  Well, here's the bottom line.
[00:36:38.757 --> 00:36:40.740]  Could it continue?
[00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:42.001]  Because we allow it to continue.
[00:36:42.021 --> 00:36:44.885]  If you look at the presidential debates these years, the presidential candidates,
[00:36:45.345 --> 00:36:51.349]  I don't know of any candidates calling for full withdrawal from the United Nations for this kind of utter nonsense.
[00:36:51.529 --> 00:36:55.551]  There's not a single candidate that's called for the withdrawal of the United Nations climate process.
[00:36:55.611 --> 00:36:59.294]  In fact, we can expect a President Romney to accelerate it.
[00:36:59.314 --> 00:37:03.736]  You know, President Obama hasn't even, probably you could argue, has done less than George Bush did.
[00:37:04.057 --> 00:37:05.638]  George Bush was committed to this.
[00:37:05.898 --> 00:37:10.260]  The first George Bush, George Herbert Walker Bush, got us into this whole mess of the Earth Summit.
[00:37:10.481 --> 00:37:13.983]  So whenever you give people like the United Nations legitimacy,
[00:37:14.543 --> 00:37:16.744]  They have cast themselves as our saviors.
[00:37:38.456 --> 00:37:45.259]  They have sold everybody on this idea that they're the good guys.
[00:37:45.519 --> 00:37:47.180]  We don't agree with them and give them all our money.
[00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:48.641]  We're the bad guys.
[00:37:48.661 --> 00:37:49.781]  We're bad to have kids.
[00:37:50.362 --> 00:37:51.462]  They teach that in the news.
[00:37:51.642 --> 00:37:53.963]  Depression's good because it cuts our carbon footprint.
[00:37:54.484 --> 00:37:56.144]  Don't use oil because it's running out.
[00:37:56.484 --> 00:37:58.105]  And all the studies show they're finding more.
[00:37:58.365 --> 00:37:59.246]  But here's Bloomberg.
[00:37:59.286 --> 00:38:02.127]  It just seems on every front people are turning against them.
[00:38:02.167 --> 00:38:03.468]  Reality is turning against them.
[00:38:03.868 --> 00:38:05.769]  Peak oil scare fades a shale.
[00:38:06.349 --> 00:38:14.394]  Deep water wells gush crude, and now they're finding old wells all over the world are refilling, and more scientists are saying, you know what?
[00:38:15.135 --> 00:38:19.737]  This stuff is not coming from dinosaur blood or dinosaur oil.
[00:38:20.078 --> 00:38:21.599]  This is coming somewhere else.
[00:38:21.919 --> 00:38:23.140]  Wells are refilling.
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:25.081]  How does that fit into their scaremongering?
[00:38:25.321 --> 00:38:26.842]  On every front, they're being reversed.
[00:38:27.402 --> 00:38:30.863]  Yeah, we're facing now actual energy independence.
[00:38:30.883 --> 00:38:33.883]  We're going to be a net energy exporter of natural gas.
[00:38:33.923 --> 00:38:42.025]  And by 2016, technology and free markets and allowing people and allowing stuff.
[00:38:42.085 --> 00:38:46.026]  And the reason natural gas has exploded is because mostly they were state and local regulations.
[00:38:46.066 --> 00:38:50.486]  Had the federal government been heavily involved in that, this whole thing would have been squashed early on.
[00:38:50.686 --> 00:38:53.227]  Thank God President Obama hasn't been able to get his hands
[00:38:53.627 --> 00:38:53.827]  Thank you.
[00:39:11.826 --> 00:39:12.847]  Well, well said.
[00:39:13.087 --> 00:39:15.569]  I mean, this is such a diabolical plan.
[00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:17.391]  And they admit it's about a power grab.
[00:39:17.411 --> 00:39:19.573]  They admit it's about a global government.
[00:39:19.853 --> 00:39:23.076]  And you're going to be on the radio tomorrow, breaking more of this down with us.
[00:39:23.757 --> 00:39:27.940]  Mark Moreno, Climate Depot, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.422]  And I look forward to talking to you tomorrow.
[00:39:29.882 --> 00:39:30.543]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:39:30.823 --> 00:39:31.163]  Thank you.
[00:39:31.323 --> 00:39:31.744]  Thank you.
[00:39:31.824 --> 00:39:32.765]  Wow.
[00:39:32.965 --> 00:39:34.106]  He's totally vindicated.
[00:39:35.147 --> 00:39:35.948]  We're vindicated.
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:41.362]  I mean, this is just such a ridiculous takeover that we're dealing with here.
[00:39:41.942 --> 00:39:45.383]  I mean, here's an example out of Scientific American.
[00:39:45.403 --> 00:39:47.004]  We'll show you a document cam shot of that.
[00:39:47.684 --> 00:39:58.088]  Lake Vostok is almost breached for 20 million years, reportedly drilled by the Russians, and they say in the next 24 hours or so that they're going to break through into this
[00:39:59.108 --> 00:40:10.095]  And here's the Scientific American article on it, and the media is freaking out over it saying they shouldn't be allowed to drill in because there's just 20 million year old organisms down in there.
[00:40:10.936 --> 00:40:12.457]  I'll guarantee you stuff's gotten down in there.
[00:40:12.697 --> 00:40:14.278]  And how dare you contaminate it?
[00:40:14.799 --> 00:40:17.060]  It's just this idea that humans can't go anywhere.
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.601]  Humans can't do anything.
[00:40:18.881 --> 00:40:22.224]  But we can have 40 year old nuclear reactors melting down and blowing up everywhere.
[00:40:22.264 --> 00:40:22.784]  That's fine.
[00:40:22.804 --> 00:40:27.727]  Or create GMO that infects the entire biosphere with totally different species.
[00:40:27.767 --> 00:40:28.448]  That's fine.
[00:40:29.528 --> 00:40:34.192]  When the globalists do it, but don't you dare a scientist drill in to find out what's in this lake.
[00:40:34.232 --> 00:40:35.853]  Amazing story, we'll cover it more tomorrow.
[00:40:37.134 --> 00:40:44.959]  Another incredible story, with a straight face, the Washington Post reports that they're charging people whose five-year-old daughter
[00:40:48.177 --> 00:40:51.521]  Has been late to class, so they're going to criminally charge him.
[00:40:51.781 --> 00:40:53.322]  We talked to the lawyer dad today.
[00:40:53.342 --> 00:40:55.545]  He goes, the code doesn't even say this is illegal.
[00:40:55.805 --> 00:40:58.588]  I don't know how they've charged me because they're just crazy crooks.
[00:40:59.129 --> 00:41:02.052]  And these courts are just lawless centers of pure evil.
[00:41:03.193 --> 00:41:05.775]  Great article here out of Alt-Market.
[00:41:06.116 --> 00:41:08.518]  The DHS defends globalism, not America.
[00:41:08.979 --> 00:41:09.439]  Absolutely.
[00:41:09.459 --> 00:41:10.460]  They defend the globalist.
[00:41:12.377 --> 00:41:16.044]  Also, there's new reports here, now if you speak out against U.S.
[00:41:16.124 --> 00:41:19.489]  drone strikes, you're a terrorist sympathizer.
[00:41:19.509 --> 00:41:22.935]  That's what the corporate media is reporting and saying.
[00:41:24.653 --> 00:41:26.554]  That's just some of the reports we've got here today.
[00:41:27.234 --> 00:41:33.316]  Another one, the FBI paying cash for a cup of coffee, a potential indicator of terrorist activity.
[00:41:33.656 --> 00:41:37.677]  Now if you pay for a $2 cup of coffee or a $1 bottle of water, cash is evil.
[00:41:38.117 --> 00:41:45.940]  Everything's got to be tracked and traced by the globalists so they can add fines and fees on it or turn off your digital system if you're not a good globalist.
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:54.951]  And I, of course, have issued a worldwide alert that I just see all the preconditioning and propaganda going on that I saw right before 9-11.
[00:41:55.452 --> 00:41:57.094]  Now blaming domestic groups.
[00:41:57.955 --> 00:42:02.220]  Reuters has a report where they're saying, you know, domestic groups are the biggest threat.
[00:42:03.722 --> 00:42:06.245]  And that, you know, libertarians are basically terrorists.
[00:42:06.285 --> 00:42:08.307]  Here's that Reuters report.
[00:42:08.367 --> 00:42:09.909]  People who think the government's too big.
[00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:15.696]  People who think the UN is taking over our country, which it publicly admits it is, with the agenda 21.
[00:42:16.036 --> 00:42:16.617]  We're bad.
[00:42:16.677 --> 00:42:17.358]  We're terrorists.
[00:42:17.398 --> 00:42:17.918]  We're evil.
[00:42:18.619 --> 00:42:20.741]  And here is the report at InfoWars.com.
[00:42:20.761 --> 00:42:22.383]  I hope everybody gets out to everyone they know.
[00:42:22.804 --> 00:42:24.806]  InfoWars issues emergency terror alert.
[00:42:25.166 --> 00:42:27.148]  Threat of a false flag event has never been higher.
[00:42:27.408 --> 00:42:29.891]  Get this out to everybody and it may back the globalists off.
[00:42:30.451 --> 00:42:31.973]  And we can also have another big effect.
[00:42:33.074 --> 00:42:37.879]  People say, well, the Senate has passed a bill to where you
[00:42:40.868 --> 00:42:44.433]  Can't have your local airport not run by TSA.
[00:42:44.994 --> 00:42:46.256]  You can just have private security.
[00:42:46.276 --> 00:42:48.559]  People say, well, they'll just continue.
[00:42:50.785 --> 00:42:53.806]  Groping and grabbing on us and all the rest of it with the new company.
[00:42:54.046 --> 00:42:56.347]  The point is, is that we'll then go after those groups.
[00:42:56.787 --> 00:42:57.648]  We're fighting back.
[00:42:57.668 --> 00:42:59.068]  This agency's being destroyed.
[00:42:59.428 --> 00:43:01.029]  And just renaming it isn't going to save them.
[00:43:01.569 --> 00:43:01.869]  Okay?
[00:43:01.909 --> 00:43:02.830]  We know what's going on.
[00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:03.710]  We know what's happening.
[00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:07.032]  We know it's a brown shirt meant to overthrow the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:43:07.372 --> 00:43:11.013]  There's a lot of other news I didn't get to, but I know Rob Dewey covered a lot of it earlier.
[00:43:11.053 --> 00:43:12.674]  The Ron Paul information is just amazing.
[00:43:13.334 --> 00:43:15.955]  And we'll be back tomorrow night, 7 o'clock central.
