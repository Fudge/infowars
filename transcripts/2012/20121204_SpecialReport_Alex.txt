[00:00:10.706 --> 00:00:13.347]  I'm Melissa Melton reporting for InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:14.107 --> 00:00:21.269]  Zero Dark Thirty, the film supposedly based on the true story official accounts of the killing of Osama Bin Laden, is set to release in U.S.
[00:00:21.309 --> 00:00:22.690]  theaters December 19th.
[00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.151]  We are still no closer to defeating our enemy.
[00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:30.712]  Twenty detainees recognize that photo.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:45.403]  In analyzing the clip you just saw, Jessica Chastain stars as CIA operative Maya, a woman obsessed with capturing the man supposedly behind the September 11th terrorist attacks.
[00:00:45.803 --> 00:00:50.985]  The New York Film Critics Guide was apparently so moved, they named Zero Dark Thirty Film of the Year.
[00:00:51.897 --> 00:00:55.239]  Now let's analyze a clip of actual Osama Bin Laden raid footage.
[00:01:27.432 --> 00:01:29.614]  We can't be sure if that's legitimate footage or not.
[00:01:29.654 --> 00:01:36.539]  You see, so much misinfo and disinfo came out in the wake of the raid that it's really hard to understand what's real or what's not anymore.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.123]  And really, shouldn't the makers of Zero Dark Thirty be concerned about the same thing?
[00:01:41.603 --> 00:01:47.248]  If you'll recall, Osama Bin Laden was supposedly taken down in a raid at a compound in Abbottabad in 2011.
[00:01:47.308 --> 00:01:54.173]  The death of Bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat Al Qaeda.
[00:01:54.453 --> 00:01:56.255]  President Obama addressed the nation.
[00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:05.566]  late Sunday evening to say that just hours before Osama Bin Laden had been killed in the middle of a major populated city in a palace compound.
[00:02:06.465 --> 00:02:17.275]  My friends, this is a complete and total hoax, and we predicted with total precision, with inside sources, going back more than 8 years ago, exactly what would happen.
[00:02:17.715 --> 00:02:22.299]  Then Bin Laden's body was buried at sea, all within 24 hours after the raid.
[00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:31.907]  Our government claimed his burial was per Islamic tradition, but many Muslim scholars have come forward to point out that this, like so much else in the official story, is false.
[00:02:32.788 --> 00:02:48.794]  Over the years, many people, from intelligence analysts to heads of state, including former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, and former FBI head of counterterrorism Dale Watson, have gone on record to say that Bin Laden died in 2001.
[00:02:50.775 --> 00:02:53.956]  Dr. Steve Pichinik, who has worked with five different U.S.
[00:02:54.036 --> 00:03:04.020]  presidents and the Department of Defense, has even come out to say that Osama bin Laden died in 2001 of Marfan syndrome, a degenerative genetic disease with no permanent cure.
[00:03:04.878 --> 00:03:23.206]  With the intel, with the CIA reports you were reading, with as much proof as you can give us without giving up your sources, of knowing that Bin Laden was dead, and when he reportedly died, so that we can look at the big news story now in context of why they've launched this hoax today.
[00:03:24.295 --> 00:03:31.020]  Well, let me just say, the issue of why he was dead, it was exactly what I said before.
[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.642]  He died of Marfan Syndrome.
[00:03:33.282 --> 00:03:33.943]  Bush Jr.
[00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:34.603]  knew about it.
[00:03:34.683 --> 00:03:36.545]  The intelligence community knew about it.
[00:03:36.645 --> 00:03:41.209]  He had Al-Zawahiri, who was a physician with him, who is still a physician.
[00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:42.389]  I don't know where he is.
[00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.591]  But we knew he was already dead by 9-11.
[00:03:45.805 --> 00:03:57.655]  In fact, two separate high-level sources have told Alex Jones directly that not only was Bin Laden dead since 2001, but his death would not be announced until the most politically opportune moment.
[00:03:58.176 --> 00:04:01.959]  This all came out right at the time.
[00:04:03.345 --> 00:04:08.886]  That Obama's approval rating was dropping like a rock, an all-time low, this far into a president's administration.
[00:04:09.266 --> 00:04:17.809]  As the dollars dropping, as support for Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and the drone attacks in Pakistan was imploding.
[00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.269]  Right as the Pakistanis were threatening to kick the U.S.
[00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.110]  out of Pakistan and to kick their drones out.
[00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.431]  Right as this happens, there's this big propaganda victory, and what do they do?
[00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.071]  They take the body and throw it in the ocean.
[00:04:31.211 --> 00:04:32.671]  They say, do you really believe that?
[00:04:32.831 --> 00:04:33.971]  No one is buying that.
[00:04:34.511 --> 00:04:41.853]  When the announcement finally came that Osama Bin Laden was dead, the White House changed its story so many times, it was hard to keep anything straight.
[00:04:42.213 --> 00:04:44.714]  First, the raid involved a 40-minute shootout.
[00:04:45.354 --> 00:04:46.734]  Then, there was no shootout.
[00:04:47.054 --> 00:04:49.395]  Then, only one unnamed man was armed.
[00:04:49.995 --> 00:04:51.416]  Then Bin Laden was armed.
[00:04:51.836 --> 00:04:56.538]  Then he wasn't armed, and it was reported that he used his wife as a human shield.
[00:04:56.918 --> 00:05:09.684]  To go along with the ever-changing official's story, the White House also released a Situation Room photo depicting a grave President Obama and Hillary Clinton with her hand over her mouth, supposedly watching the Bin Laden raid live.
[00:05:10.364 --> 00:05:17.988]  But CIA Director Leon Panetta later admitted that wasn't possible, as the live feed had been cut before the Navy SEAL team even went in.
[00:05:18.933 --> 00:05:28.797]  Speaking of the Navy SEALs that carried out the raid, controversy intensified when our government announced that some members of SEAL Team 6, responsible for the raid, died in a helicopter crash two months later.
[00:05:29.437 --> 00:05:38.501]  I have two sources inside the Army and I have another source inside the Marines, a colonel, who have confirmed and talked to members of the family.
[00:05:38.908 --> 00:05:39.368]  of course.
[00:05:53.635 --> 00:05:58.200]  In the wake of the raid, Disney even tried to copyright the name Navy Seal Team 6.
[00:05:59.561 --> 00:06:03.045]  The Situation Room photo wasn't the only photo proven a fraud, either.
[00:06:03.065 --> 00:06:11.734]  A photograph the media pounced all over in the days following the raid, reportedly of Bin Laden's body, was also shown to be a manipulated fake.
[00:06:12.435 --> 00:06:15.256]  Multiple books were also released following the raid.
[00:06:15.736 --> 00:06:23.698]  The latest one published by a Navy SEAL who claimed his work was a first-hand boots-on-the-ground account and that he witnessed Bin Laden's death with his own eyes.
[00:06:24.398 --> 00:06:27.959]  The publisher even claimed the book was not vetted by the Pentagon.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:37.362]  But as we witnessed with the arrest and detainment of Brandon Robb, release of an unapproved book of this magnitude would garner a full-scale assault on its author.
[00:06:38.686 --> 00:06:39.507]  So let's recap.
[00:06:39.608 --> 00:06:47.781]  Ten years later, and the greatest manhunt in history as the movie puts it, and we finally caught and killed the man responsible for one of the greatest crimes ever committed on U.S.
[00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:52.069]  soil, and yet we have no valid photographs and no conclusive proof.
[00:06:53.502 --> 00:06:57.745]  If you want a conspiracy theory to exist, that's how you start it.
[00:06:59.386 --> 00:07:14.055]  The most elusive character on the face of the planet, the most elusive human being, the Bigfoot of people, and you catch him and kill him, but yeah, we chucked him in the drink right away because we didn't want any more problems.
[00:07:14.468 --> 00:07:27.596]  The latest news to break on the Bin Laden raid came a few weeks ago, when heavily redacted emails obtained through an Associated Press FOIA request revealed that no American sailors aboard the USS Carl Vinton had witnessed Bin Laden's sea burial.
[00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:34.700]  Another email from the Public Affairs Officer claimed that only a small group of the ship's leadership were even informed of the burial.
[00:07:35.239 --> 00:07:49.565]  Though the release of Zero Dark Thirty was delayed until after the presidential election, supposedly to ward off accusations of a political agenda, with a mountain of evidence showing we've never been given the full story here, it's hard to think this movie has anything but a political agenda.
[00:07:50.485 --> 00:07:55.026]  So much propaganda was released following the Bin Laden raid, it's unclear what really happened.
[00:07:55.467 --> 00:08:03.369]  But saying this movie is based on a true story is a lot like saying Winnie the Pooh is based on a real life bear named Winifred and a real life little boy named Christopher Robin.
[00:08:03.769 --> 00:08:06.850]  And yet, I've never seen one talking tiger in real life.
