[00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:10.255]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.916 --> 00:00:11.717]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.498 --> 00:00:13.400]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.746]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.247 --> 00:00:22.312]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.624 --> 00:00:30.566]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, the 30th day of July.
[00:00:30.606 --> 00:00:32.267]  We're now going to be more than halfway into the year.
[00:00:32.887 --> 00:00:33.628]  Just incredible.
[00:00:34.608 --> 00:00:36.969]  Final hours of July here in the next two days.
[00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.511]  We're going to be here for the next three hours.
[00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:47.215]  Larry Pratt was on the nightly news last Friday and said, yeah, a lot of evidence that the shooting in Colorado was an inside job.
[00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:55.559]  And you notice that the mainstream corporate media, the dying dinosaur Decepticon media, hasn't even attacked him for that.
[00:00:57.196 --> 00:00:58.917]  Because they don't want people looking at that.
[00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:22.617]  Like it was admitted a week ago that the supposed shooter, Mr. Ronald McDonald Patsy, as he's known by our listeners, who's obviously drugged out of his gourd when he's in court, it came out that, well basically we're going to be breaking it all down here today.
[00:01:23.735 --> 00:01:27.036]  With Larry Pratt, all the different inconsistencies, the issues with it.
[00:01:27.416 --> 00:01:32.838]  But that's not going to be the main reason Larry Pratt joins us coming up today.
[00:01:32.858 --> 00:01:37.139]  We're going to be getting into something that's getting zero coverage, basically.
[00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.660]  I mean, it's in a few newspapers, but it
[00:01:41.221 --> 00:01:43.182]  It should be getting massive coverage.
[00:01:43.262 --> 00:01:47.744]  Democratic Senators offer gun control amendment for cyber security bill.
[00:01:47.804 --> 00:01:48.964]  That's the Hill newspaper.
[00:01:49.485 --> 00:01:58.008]  And I've got a copy of the bill here with me, S-32, the cyber security bill that's very close to passing.
[00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:09.113]  And the usual suspect, Chuckie Schumer, wants us all to live in the type of hell that he's in control of with his armed guards and everybody else disarmed there in the nanny state of New York.
[00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:19.699]  Well, now Chuckie Schumer has introduced this and, well, it says it will ban all clips 10 rounds and above.
[00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.620]  And I don't mean for manufacturer sale.
[00:02:22.538 --> 00:02:23.979]  It says from possession.
[00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:28.180]  And it describes banning devices that can take the clips.
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:29.961]  So that's most guns.
[00:02:30.101 --> 00:02:39.964]  And we saw the ATF last year come out with a rulemaking without law and said we will ban most shotguns over 60% if they can take a clip or barrel.
[00:02:41.092 --> 00:02:44.134]  And of course, you know, Scalia has said, well, it's reasonable.
[00:02:44.174 --> 00:02:46.795]  Yeah, you got a Second Amendment, basically a right to turn those guns in.
[00:02:47.675 --> 00:02:49.376]  That's what they said four years ago.
[00:02:49.456 --> 00:02:51.437]  I warned everybody about that Supreme Court ruling.
[00:02:51.477 --> 00:02:54.699]  I said, hey, it says right here, you got a right, but that they can restrict it.
[00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:59.682]  You know, that there can be reasonable restrictions as the government arms the teeth against us.
[00:03:00.162 --> 00:03:01.583]  And we got Bill Kristol.
[00:03:01.643 --> 00:03:03.224]  We've got Rupert Murdoch.
[00:03:03.684 --> 00:03:06.365]  The list goes on and on saying, yeah, it's reasonable.
[00:03:06.425 --> 00:03:07.606]  You don't need semi-auto.
[00:03:08.732 --> 00:03:09.512]  You don't need that.
[00:03:09.552 --> 00:03:12.173]  And then Michael Moore's like, ban everything down to Flintlocks.
[00:03:12.253 --> 00:03:14.614]  And Bloomberg goes further.
[00:03:14.654 --> 00:03:16.274]  He says, no, just have the police stand down.
[00:03:16.294 --> 00:03:18.775]  So we're going to spend a lot of time on this today.
[00:03:18.795 --> 00:03:25.357]  And we're going to have Larry Pratt popping in at the start of the third hour today.
[00:03:25.817 --> 00:03:34.560]  And then we have a fellow who's done reporting for us in the past, who was in Chicago and showed TSA on the streets.
[00:03:36.421 --> 00:03:38.743]  And they're at the bus terminal and the train stations.
[00:03:39.263 --> 00:03:40.464]  They're all over the country now.
[00:03:41.324 --> 00:03:42.865]  And it went on the web.
[00:03:42.885 --> 00:03:44.546]  It got quite a bit of attention.
[00:03:45.207 --> 00:03:55.913]  And so the next time he was there, they came to him when he was at a snack shop, a little restaurant there at the subway, I guess, and threatened him with terrorism.
[00:03:55.933 --> 00:03:57.514]  They said, it's terrorism to film us.
[00:03:57.954 --> 00:03:59.315]  They said, I've got the First Amendment.
[00:03:59.355 --> 00:04:02.057]  And they kind of scurry off after a while after threatening him.
[00:04:02.077 --> 00:04:03.878]  But this is the new America.
[00:04:04.378 --> 00:04:12.725]  And we are in the hands of just lawless, out-of-control miscreants who lust after power because they're nobodies.
[00:04:13.245 --> 00:04:16.007]  They have no success, no one wants to associate with them.
[00:04:17.928 --> 00:04:19.390]  This is the government class.
[00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.854]  This is a bunch of failures telling us to salute them and bow down to them occupying our country.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.903]  And God help us because we're in very, very deep and dire straits right now.
[00:04:32.163 --> 00:04:35.925]  We have a huge radio broadcast live today on so many fronts.
[00:04:35.945 --> 00:04:43.890]  Hey, did you hear the Penn State head who was ousted for the cover-up at Penn State?
[00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.273]  Well, they've got a new job in Homeland Security in the NSA watching us.
[00:04:51.354 --> 00:04:51.814]  Oh, yeah.
[00:04:52.915 --> 00:04:55.917]  He's going up to the big leagues after a job well done.
[00:05:01.323 --> 00:05:05.567]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:05.867 --> 00:05:06.487]  Number one.
[00:05:06.788 --> 00:05:09.930]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.791]  Number two.
[00:05:11.071 --> 00:05:15.635]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:15.975 --> 00:05:16.416]  It's true.
[00:05:16.716 --> 00:05:21.280]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.141]  Number three.
[00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:25.704]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:26.004 --> 00:05:29.667]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:29.887 --> 00:05:30.427]  Number 4.
[00:05:30.688 --> 00:05:33.049]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.832]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:37.132 --> 00:05:37.672]  Number 5.
[00:05:37.913 --> 00:05:41.835]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:42.076 --> 00:05:46.839]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:51.142]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:51.282 --> 00:05:52.844]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:53.064 --> 00:05:55.165]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:05:55.326 --> 00:05:57.667]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:06:02.998 --> 00:06:06.639]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:15.080]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.861]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:06:20.441 --> 00:06:31.263]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:06:31.903 --> 00:06:40.911]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:41.412 --> 00:06:46.476]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:06:46.857 --> 00:06:54.023]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:54.343 --> 00:06:57.106]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:07:00.968 --> 00:07:06.210]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.651]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:14.392]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure.
[00:07:14.592 --> 00:07:17.813]  And it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:07:17.974 --> 00:07:21.155]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[00:07:21.415 --> 00:07:22.835]  There's no priming required.
[00:07:23.095 --> 00:07:25.136]  It's NSF 42 certified.
[00:07:25.376 --> 00:07:27.857]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[00:07:28.937 --> 00:07:30.277]  Easy to set up and use.
[00:07:30.457 --> 00:07:31.758]  Doesn't require electricity.
[00:07:31.898 --> 00:07:34.739]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:07:35.059 --> 00:07:38.219]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:42.421]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:07:42.581 --> 00:07:45.161]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:07:45.301 --> 00:07:46.622]  It's what my family uses.
[00:07:46.882 --> 00:07:50.082]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[00:07:50.203 --> 00:07:55.444]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[00:07:56.024 --> 00:07:58.607]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[00:07:58.727 --> 00:08:04.174]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:07.538]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.734 --> 00:08:20.941]  Coming up later in the third hour today, Julio Rossello, who's done some reporting off and on for InfoWars.com, is going to be joining us.
[00:08:21.022 --> 00:08:26.385]  A dramatic video that we showed on the Nightly News with Luke Radowsky on Friday of
[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:42.367]  TSA setting up checkpoints inside Chicago and then coming over to Julio and saying you're a terrorist if you tape us, don't you dare tape us.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:53.727]  And they're announcing not just face scanning cameras and license plate reading cameras, but listening devices all over New York run by the control freak in chief, Mayor Bloomberg.
[00:08:53.747 --> 00:08:55.028]  We're going to be going over all that.
[00:08:55.469 --> 00:09:00.172]  Big Sis told us what was already in Homeland Security documents since 2009.
[00:09:00.752 --> 00:09:04.835]  Indeed, they are surveilling us with drones for, quote, public safety.
[00:09:04.855 --> 00:09:07.777]  You know, when the cops pull you over, they say it's public safety.
[00:09:07.857 --> 00:09:12.401]  When the TSA goes bobbing for apples in your
[00:09:13.101 --> 00:09:16.542]  In your underwear, they are doing it for your safety.
[00:09:16.562 --> 00:09:20.242]  When they put cancer viruses in your vaccines, it's for your safety.
[00:09:20.582 --> 00:09:25.944]  When they nerve gas our own troops in thousands of tests and kill them and dissect their bodies, it's for your safety.
[00:09:26.624 --> 00:09:30.404]  When Jerry Sandusky raped children brutally, it was for your safety.
[00:09:30.744 --> 00:09:33.125]  When the college covered it up, it was for your safety.
[00:09:33.425 --> 00:09:37.286]  When Hitler lined people up and shot them, it was for their safety.
[00:09:39.026 --> 00:09:44.029]  Everything these scumbag, out-of-control tyrants do is for your safety.
[00:09:48.192 --> 00:09:50.053]  And I just lost power in here.
[00:09:50.073 --> 00:09:51.334]  Are we still on air?
[00:09:52.695 --> 00:09:53.295]  Okay, good.
[00:09:53.756 --> 00:09:54.736]  Okay, fantastic.
[00:09:54.776 --> 00:09:55.417]  Well, that's good.
[00:09:55.477 --> 00:09:59.760]  Something... I guess the lights just went out for our safety.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.362]  But continuing, the article I want is red-linked.
[00:10:03.882 --> 00:10:05.583]  It's in the features...
[00:10:07.779 --> 00:10:12.202]  It's in the features, because this isn't it.
[00:10:12.743 --> 00:10:17.246]  It's the UN Treaty would use foreign troops inside America.
[00:10:17.286 --> 00:10:19.107]  We covered it Friday, but I want to cover it more today.
[00:10:19.448 --> 00:10:23.211]  It's red-linked, in the tiles, that's the article, that's it.
[00:10:27.294 --> 00:10:33.278]  All right, continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, with the news.
[00:10:33.658 --> 00:10:36.881]  You know, I'm going to get into the whole gun situation, because it's dire straits.
[00:10:38.134 --> 00:10:41.217]  They've come out and announced that Hal Guns won on the cover of Time.
[00:10:41.257 --> 00:10:43.399]  I talked a lot about this yesterday on the Sunday show.
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.764]  This signals a major counter-offensive against us, so get ready.
[00:10:50.005 --> 00:10:58.913]  And they will try to march the police out to confiscate the guns, and I think they can get away with it, and basically start a chival war in this country.
[00:11:00.635 --> 00:11:00.815]  Now,
[00:11:02.239 --> 00:11:08.484]  I want to go over the other news before I get into all of this incredibly important information.
[00:11:09.245 --> 00:11:11.067]  I heard local talk radio this morning.
[00:11:12.302 --> 00:11:16.786]  You're basically saying, oh yeah, I guess we're going to have to have security in the theaters now because of the epidemic of shootings.
[00:11:17.446 --> 00:11:22.470]  And I tried to call into the show to say, you know, the Justice Department says there's been a 0.1% increase since 1992.
[00:11:22.631 --> 00:11:26.754]  In 20 years, a 0.1% increase in shootings of more than five people at one time.
[00:11:26.814 --> 00:11:27.474]  So basically, it's flat.
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.321]  They'd actually gone down some in the mid-2000s.
[00:11:37.922 --> 00:11:38.822]  I follow those numbers.
[00:11:39.322 --> 00:11:43.004]  They said, you know, no thanks, we don't want to hear that.
[00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:50.088]  They were also bumbling around talking about, you know, was this guy on psychotropics or not?
[00:11:51.268 --> 00:11:59.673]  Well, the supposed shooter, who everybody's already convicted, Mr. Ronald McDonald, it's come out that he was on a bunch of drugs.
[00:11:59.693 --> 00:12:03.595]  That's been in the Denver Post, it's been in the Daily Mail,
[00:12:04.847 --> 00:12:15.771]  He had a former head Air Force psychiatrist, the head of the entire San Antonio operation, before she went to work there at the facility where he was at there in Denver at that college.
[00:12:16.711 --> 00:12:22.393]  She had been reprimanded for over-prescribing and improperly prescribing psychotropics and antipsychotics.
[00:12:23.173 --> 00:12:26.695]  But you can never blame that, even though it's the case in almost every case.
[00:12:26.715 --> 00:12:30.456]  You know, the guy that just shot a cop for no reason at a Walmart here in Austin.
[00:12:30.476 --> 00:12:32.877]  I said, he'll be on psychotropics, and it came out he was.
[00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:38.196]  Sergeant Bales shooting all the people.
[00:12:38.316 --> 00:12:39.997]  Turned out he was under psychiatric care.
[00:12:40.877 --> 00:12:42.859]  Had part of his foot blown off, didn't want to go back.
[00:12:43.219 --> 00:12:45.601]  They hopped him up on a bunch of serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[00:12:46.241 --> 00:12:47.322]  And they sent him back into there.
[00:12:47.402 --> 00:12:49.963]  Not a good idea to give somebody a dream state hallucinogen.
[00:12:50.464 --> 00:12:51.144]  Psychotropic.
[00:12:51.364 --> 00:12:51.945]  That's what they are.
[00:12:52.005 --> 00:12:55.267]  They just more heavily induce you into the dream state.
[00:12:58.289 --> 00:13:01.011]  That's what Prozac basically feels like from people that have taken it.
[00:13:02.603 --> 00:13:09.464]  Is like you've been watching TV for four hours, and you have that mind-numbed, you know, feeling interface with the television.
[00:13:09.904 --> 00:13:11.485]  That's what the system wants.
[00:13:11.565 --> 00:13:12.565]  That's what they're after.
[00:13:13.085 --> 00:13:15.225]  Now, here's the big red alert.
[00:13:17.526 --> 00:13:22.987]  Because I listened to talk radio, national and local, from early this morning, and no one was talking about it.
[00:13:23.067 --> 00:13:29.228]  It's nowhere in the news, except the Hill newspaper, Fox News, and AP have little blurbs about it.
[00:13:31.076 --> 00:13:38.079]  The Drudge Report, DrudgeReport.com link to it, InfoWars.com link to it, but it's basically getting no coverage despite that.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:44.302]  Now remember, we're conspiracy theorists to think that they might want to take our Second Amendment.
[00:13:44.682 --> 00:13:51.525]  They have introduced legislation that bans semi-auto, and bans clips above 10 rounds, and bans guns that can take clips.
[00:13:52.816 --> 00:13:55.498]  It says devices and the clips.
[00:13:55.578 --> 00:13:56.598]  Okay, I've read the bill.
[00:13:56.678 --> 00:13:57.619]  You can go read the bill.
[00:13:58.399 --> 00:14:00.981]  Here is the Hill newspaper.
[00:14:01.521 --> 00:14:04.723]  Democratic senators offer gun control amendment for cyber security bill.
[00:14:05.823 --> 00:14:07.284]  Now this has a chance of passing.
[00:14:08.105 --> 00:14:10.866]  Just like NDAA did and just like government health care did.
[00:14:11.527 --> 00:14:13.508]  This is the season where they want to get stuff done.
[00:14:14.605 --> 00:14:18.566]  That's why you've got all these top Republicans coming out and endorsing, restricting the Second Amendment.
[00:14:18.586 --> 00:14:25.368]  So I'm going to break all this down in about 20 minutes after I get to some of the other news, but I've got to cover some of the other news before I get into this central issue.
[00:14:26.188 --> 00:14:31.969]  But the criminal class knows that we're waking up and they're coming at us from every angle.
[00:14:33.669 --> 00:14:34.630]  And that's the bottom line.
[00:14:37.489 --> 00:14:49.397]  This, again, proves wherever they're in control, Chicago, New York, wherever this globalist mafia is in control, there's a total gun ban for the citizens, and the governing class all have semi-auto, full-auto bodyguards paid for by taxpayers.
[00:14:50.138 --> 00:14:53.280]  Or there's waivers so Donald Trump can have guys with submachine guns.
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:15:00.065]  But you and your mother, your wife, your daughter, your son, they get to get mugged, raped, and killed, and then it's no big deal.
[00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:04.288]  Hell, a lot of times it's by the police in New York, the biggest street gang in the world.
[00:15:06.087 --> 00:15:07.588]  Who wants you to know they're a street gang?
[00:15:08.749 --> 00:15:14.032]  And there's just constant movies, Batman, Spider-Man, you name it, where we do nothing but worship the NYPD.
[00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:16.553]  Well, if that's the model of worship, look out.
[00:15:17.634 --> 00:15:20.175]  Are there some really professional, good police forces in this country?
[00:15:20.195 --> 00:15:20.455]  Yes.
[00:15:20.876 --> 00:15:22.436]  Who haven't succumbed to total criminality?
[00:15:22.456 --> 00:15:22.717]  Yes.
[00:15:23.537 --> 00:15:31.682]  But more and more, they are totally becoming nothing but warlord systems and mafia jokes.
[00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:34.820]  And America knows that.
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.561]  Yes, we are winning the gun debate.
[00:15:36.621 --> 00:15:38.583]  It's true what Time Magazine says with Haar.
[00:15:38.603 --> 00:15:39.803]  We're winning the hearts and minds.
[00:15:40.464 --> 00:15:41.845]  But the system doesn't care.
[00:15:41.865 --> 00:15:42.565]  That's the bad news.
[00:15:42.585 --> 00:15:43.506]  They're going ahead with all this.
[00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:45.728]  So I'm going to... I'm already starting to cover this.
[00:15:45.768 --> 00:15:58.917]  The point is, there is legislation introduced, the cyber security bill, that guts the internet and free speech and the rest of it, that says it wants reasonable gun control
[00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:12.322]  And it says SA-2575 would make it illegal to transfer or possess large capacity feeding devices such as gun magazines, belts, feed straps, and drums of more than 10 rounds of ammunition.
[00:16:15.196 --> 00:16:15.636]  There you go.
[00:16:16.577 --> 00:16:17.937]  And I've read the bill itself.
[00:16:18.017 --> 00:16:19.178]  No one's even picking up on this.
[00:16:19.218 --> 00:16:26.561]  The way I read it is that it bans, just like the ATF wanted to do last year, guns that could take, quote, improvise.
[00:16:26.581 --> 00:16:28.242]  If you could build something, it's banned.
[00:16:28.502 --> 00:16:30.322]  Basically, bottom loading, side loading.
[00:16:30.342 --> 00:16:33.864]  You know, this is taking you to bolt action and single shot.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:39.560]  I'm going to say that again.
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:42.862]  They're telling you, don't worry, it's a conspiracy theory, we don't want your guns.
[00:16:42.882 --> 00:16:43.883]  You see that all the time.
[00:16:43.943 --> 00:16:45.203]  Don't run, we are your friends.
[00:16:45.724 --> 00:16:46.684]  This is not an assault.
[00:16:47.044 --> 00:16:48.065]  Tet Offensive.
[00:16:48.125 --> 00:16:49.946]  It's the Chinese New Year.
[00:16:51.947 --> 00:16:52.687]  Everybody's fine.
[00:16:52.727 --> 00:16:54.588]  Boom, they launch the attack and they broadcast.
[00:16:54.608 --> 00:16:55.349]  This is not an attack.
[00:16:55.369 --> 00:16:59.991]  A lot of people just stood there while they were being bayoneted at point blank range because it was a holiday.
[00:17:00.351 --> 00:17:01.092]  Couldn't be an attack.
[00:17:01.852 --> 00:17:03.412]  And again, this really works on people.
[00:17:03.733 --> 00:17:05.693]  They announce everywhere, oh, it's ridiculous.
[00:17:05.713 --> 00:17:08.394]  I mean, I saw dozens of articles last week, Washington Post, you name it.
[00:17:08.674 --> 00:17:10.534]  There's no, we don't want your guns.
[00:17:10.874 --> 00:17:12.195]  Obama isn't going to call for it.
[00:17:12.495 --> 00:17:16.556]  Meanwhile, all his surrogates were, and he came out and said, I'm not calling to control your guns.
[00:17:16.576 --> 00:17:18.796]  See, it's all mind games.
[00:17:19.116 --> 00:17:20.217]  You got a Second Amendment.
[00:17:21.277 --> 00:17:23.558]  You got a right to anything that isn't semi-auto.
[00:17:23.878 --> 00:17:24.858]  What Michael Moore say?
[00:17:25.098 --> 00:17:26.518]  He said, ban it down to flintlocks.
[00:17:27.058 --> 00:17:27.899]  What does Bloomberg say?
[00:17:27.959 --> 00:17:28.439]  Ban them all.
[00:17:29.286 --> 00:17:31.468]  What does Bill Kristol say on Fox?
[00:17:31.548 --> 00:17:32.809]  Ban everything semi-auto.
[00:17:33.169 --> 00:17:34.630]  What does Rupert Murdoch say?
[00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:35.911]  Hey, you don't need semi-auto.
[00:17:36.171 --> 00:17:37.612]  What has Mitt Romney said in the past?
[00:17:37.912 --> 00:17:39.313]  Folks, it's a talking point.
[00:17:39.694 --> 00:17:41.395]  They mean business.
[00:17:42.095 --> 00:17:44.037]  Business, business, business.
[00:17:45.238 --> 00:17:46.699]  And you're like, well, America won't turn them in.
[00:17:48.083 --> 00:17:49.464]  So people are going to fight back.
[00:17:49.504 --> 00:17:50.305]  That's the plan.
[00:17:50.985 --> 00:17:55.449]  They're looking at it, and they're gauging the police with NSA technology, spying on them, tracking them.
[00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:57.051]  They've got their agents everywhere.
[00:17:57.091 --> 00:18:00.193]  They're gauging the public sample rate.
[00:18:00.934 --> 00:18:01.915]  They admit they're doing this.
[00:18:02.435 --> 00:18:03.516]  Spying on everything.
[00:18:03.736 --> 00:18:06.339]  This is about those aggregates, to not just spy on one person.
[00:18:06.539 --> 00:18:10.902]  They want to be able to look at whole movements and ideas and graphs they can drill down into.
[00:18:10.922 --> 00:18:13.565]  This is all admitted.
[00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:19.446]  Makes, you know, Google Analytics look like a toy, because it is just the NSA toy they've given the public.
[00:18:21.046 --> 00:18:24.788]  They have profiles on each person, down to just incredible specifics.
[00:18:26.749 --> 00:18:27.309]  It's incredible.
[00:18:27.829 --> 00:18:39.613]  And they're there gauging, right now, with their finger on the trigger, to stage a bunch of new mass shootings, launch a new war, and announce, hey, you got your Second Amendment, turn in everything that's semi-auto.
[00:18:40.454 --> 00:18:43.175]  And it is meant to cause a civil war.
[00:18:44.366 --> 00:18:45.427]  That's why they're gearing up.
[00:18:46.567 --> 00:18:49.929]  We've been telling you for a couple years, they're gearing up for an October surprise.
[00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:51.070]  Does that mean they're going to do it?
[00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:51.931]  No, we're exposing it.
[00:18:51.971 --> 00:18:52.391]  It may not.
[00:18:52.911 --> 00:18:59.975]  But it's now being reported that DHS prepares for civil unrest as Obama poised to destroy the Second Amendment.
[00:19:00.276 --> 00:19:03.057]  They're announcing, yes, the 30,000 drones are public safety.
[00:19:03.518 --> 00:19:08.060]  Arte Saavedra wanted to buy this ridiculously expensive helicopter knowing that we'd get shot down.
[00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:12.023]  And now they're, it's OK, we're going to get federal grants for drones in Austin.
[00:19:12.938 --> 00:19:15.479]  South Texas is getting them with shotguns mounted on them.
[00:19:15.959 --> 00:19:16.719]  It's on, folks.
[00:19:17.019 --> 00:19:21.260]  This is what they plan to try to ferret people out of their houses that don't turn their guns in.
[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:28.342]  As if, if you start this civil war, as if people are going to sit in their houses and just wait for you to come get them.
[00:19:28.422 --> 00:19:37.705]  I mean, again, you know why they've said all these years the veterans are the terrorists and tell police you're going to have to fight veterans?
[00:19:38.025 --> 00:19:38.845]  Because they know
[00:19:40.236 --> 00:19:44.501]  Probably 5% of gun owners being conservative are not going to turn them in.
[00:19:45.061 --> 00:19:46.323]  And that's millions of people.
[00:19:46.823 --> 00:19:48.845]  And they know the number one group to worry about is veterans.
[00:19:49.886 --> 00:19:51.188]  So, look out.
[00:19:52.029 --> 00:19:58.656]  This is a criminal banking takeover that wants to start a civil war between the military and police against the American people.
[00:20:01.727 --> 00:20:04.810]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.
[00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:10.915]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.

[00:20:23.427 --> 00:20:27.070]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.

[00:21:39.912 --> 00:21:40.653]  This capitalism?
[00:21:40.713 --> 00:21:46.857]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:21:46.977 --> 00:21:47.798]  Hi, Ted Anderson.

[00:24:40.271 --> 00:24:41.612]  As mindless prey.
[00:24:42.293 --> 00:24:47.856]  Who are here to be lied to, sucked off of, run over and finally killed.
[00:24:50.278 --> 00:24:51.759]  They've hardened their heart against us.
[00:24:54.366 --> 00:25:01.216]  And it's time to admit how much trouble this country and the world is if we have any hope of defeating these people.
[00:25:01.897 --> 00:25:05.962]  Now they are losing the moral authority rapidly and that's what makes them so dangerous.
[00:25:06.283 --> 00:25:10.969]  They realize they've reached the tipping point where the entire public is not becoming conservative.
[00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:17.733]  Because that's a catch-all name, but are becoming constitutionalist and street smart and wise.
[00:25:18.574 --> 00:25:20.975]  The public knows you can't trust the government.
[00:25:21.195 --> 00:25:23.176]  They know the government can't and won't protect you.
[00:25:23.777 --> 00:25:34.663]  That's why gun sales were at an all-time high last month, before this month's staged event, and now the gun sales have doubled in the week after.
[00:25:36.824 --> 00:25:38.725]  The polls, I covered this yesterday,
[00:25:40.083 --> 00:25:42.564]  Got even more pro-gun nationwide after the shooting.
[00:25:43.124 --> 00:25:45.164]  Look, it doesn't matter how much stuff you stage.
[00:25:45.705 --> 00:25:46.885]  Don't you get it, criminals?
[00:25:47.125 --> 00:25:48.705]  We know who you are.
[00:25:48.986 --> 00:25:50.326]  We see you.
[00:25:50.646 --> 00:25:51.926]  We see you.
[00:25:52.226 --> 00:25:53.387]  We've caught you.
[00:25:53.627 --> 00:25:55.667]  The con games don't work anymore!
[00:25:55.888 --> 00:26:01.089]  And you can point at 30-40% of people that don't know their name or which end is up that are TV heads.
[00:26:01.309 --> 00:26:04.590]  We're not talking about the drooling group, okay?
[00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:07.371]  A large portion of the American people
[00:26:08.251 --> 00:26:11.013]  Becoming a majority is somewhat awake.
[00:26:12.474 --> 00:26:13.915]  The numbers show it across the board.
[00:26:14.075 --> 00:26:24.922]  That's why you're on the cover, I just got chills, that's why you're on the cover of Time Magazine saying we've won, Hal Gunn's won, why Americans have turned against gun control by Joe Klein.
[00:26:25.603 --> 00:26:27.884]  But Joe has got a plan to get our guns.
[00:26:28.284 --> 00:26:32.387]  Let me tell you, just because, hey, the Bolsheviks weren't popular when they took over in 1917.
[00:26:34.025 --> 00:26:35.706]  They might have had maybe 10% support.
[00:26:35.946 --> 00:26:36.627]  They didn't care.
[00:26:36.747 --> 00:26:38.908]  They were willing to take over.
[00:26:39.549 --> 00:26:40.369]  They were willing.
[00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:41.570]  Okay?
[00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:44.312]  But now these type of folks are in control of the government.
[00:26:45.092 --> 00:26:46.113]  And so what can they do?
[00:26:46.153 --> 00:26:47.794]  They can rob and destroy the economy.
[00:26:48.074 --> 00:26:50.235]  They can shut down our power plants nationwide.
[00:26:50.555 --> 00:26:52.197]  They can attack families everywhere.
[00:26:52.517 --> 00:26:54.138]  They can raise all these taxes.
[00:26:54.198 --> 00:26:57.480]  They can pass laws with tax incentives to move stuff offshore.
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.502]  They can pay $22 billion to ship General Motors to China.
[00:27:01.837 --> 00:27:06.319]  They're doing everything they can to wreck this country.
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:07.540]  That's the bad news.
[00:27:08.601 --> 00:27:09.681]  We're awake to them.
[00:27:11.702 --> 00:27:13.923]  And they're like, oh, you're awake and going to kick us out?
[00:27:14.123 --> 00:27:15.584]  We're going to burn your country down.
[00:27:15.924 --> 00:27:16.425]  And here's the deal.
[00:27:16.465 --> 00:27:17.865]  They were already busy burning it down.
[00:27:18.065 --> 00:27:22.828]  But now they've just started throwing gasoline on it because they want to make you totally dependent on them.
[00:27:22.868 --> 00:27:23.728]  They're in a race.
[00:27:24.029 --> 00:27:28.571]  That's why in Oregon they've announced you can't have your own garden and use rainwater that belongs to the government.
[00:27:30.009 --> 00:27:31.690]  They're announcing horticulture is illegal.
[00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:33.170]  You're like, really?
[00:27:33.451 --> 00:27:34.851]  Yeah, look it up, it's mainstream news.
[00:27:35.131 --> 00:27:48.657]  I'm telling you folks, the tyrants, as they know that they're about to be overthrown, are gonna get crazier and more in your face, like a pimp punching us in the nose, going, you're gonna get out there and do what I say.
[00:27:48.977 --> 00:27:49.998]  Do you understand?
[00:27:50.018 --> 00:27:51.819]  And we're like, no, we don't.
[00:27:52.419 --> 00:27:53.799]  Go ahead and call us terrorists.
[00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:55.360]  We know who the real terrorists are.
[00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:56.401]  It's you.
[00:27:57.361 --> 00:28:00.123]  When the TSA marches up on the streets of Chicago or L.A.
[00:28:00.423 --> 00:28:02.645]  and says, turn your cameras off or you're a terrorist.
[00:28:04.627 --> 00:28:09.110]  And then have the nerve to find out who the reporter is once it goes on the web and come find them.
[00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:12.933]  We've got the reporter on the last 30 minutes in Chicago.
[00:28:13.273 --> 00:28:15.575]  He got it on tape coming up threatening him.
[00:28:15.835 --> 00:28:17.757]  What happened to Luke Rodowski so many years ago?
[00:28:19.212 --> 00:28:21.673]  One of our great reporters at the time.
[00:28:21.953 --> 00:28:22.534]  What happened to him?
[00:28:22.554 --> 00:28:25.995]  He's out in front of Building 7 protesting the fact that it was clearly controlled demolition.
[00:28:26.435 --> 00:28:28.656]  And these security guards come over across the street.
[00:28:30.617 --> 00:28:32.838]  And Luke even jumped through hoops to get his little permit.
[00:28:33.479 --> 00:28:37.641]  And they go, you need to get out of here, something bad's gonna happen to you.
[00:28:37.901 --> 00:28:40.822]  You're gonna say you're a terrorist, literally, like the Godfather.
[00:28:41.162 --> 00:28:42.903]  And you're gonna be 30 days in the hole.
[00:28:43.223 --> 00:28:46.785]  I know you're not a terrorist, but I'm gonna say Cameron stuff's a bum.
[00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:51.351]  You can actually laugh like that while smoking a pipe.
[00:28:53.031 --> 00:28:54.491]  About 30 cops show up.
[00:28:55.192 --> 00:29:05.774]  The Larry Silverstein security detail that looked like Central Casting literally out of Sopranos goes, I think the camera's a bum.
[00:29:06.214 --> 00:29:08.375]  I mean, like a Bugs Bunny cartoon with gangsters.
[00:29:08.435 --> 00:29:11.615]  You know those Bugs Bunny characters where he's fighting the gangsters?
[00:29:11.835 --> 00:29:13.036]  Literally talking like that.
[00:29:13.076 --> 00:29:14.916]  It's in my film, Truth Rising.
[00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:18.650]  And the police grabbed Luke's camera.
[00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:24.653]  Now, they didn't get the other camera across the street, and they gave the camera back after he agreed to leave.
[00:29:26.654 --> 00:29:29.335]  And the cops said, we're gonna put you in jail for terrorism.
[00:29:30.295 --> 00:29:31.316]  He's like, but I'm not a terrorist.
[00:29:31.336 --> 00:29:34.798]  They go, we know, but it's us sitting now, you understand?
[00:29:35.378 --> 00:29:38.559]  See, they did 9-11, folks, and they all know it full well.
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:42.721]  We'll be right back with the news blitz, I promise.
[00:29:43.282 --> 00:29:43.742]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.762 --> 00:29:53.749]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.712 --> 00:29:57.378]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.411 --> 00:30:02.652]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:02.712 --> 00:30:08.055]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:30:08.295 --> 00:30:12.938]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:30:13.318 --> 00:30:18.402]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:30:18.902 --> 00:30:23.585]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:30:24.105 --> 00:30:31.027]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:30:31.227 --> 00:30:32.127]  And here's the best part.
[00:30:32.347 --> 00:30:38.709]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:30:39.029 --> 00:30:41.869]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:30:42.209 --> 00:30:45.290]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.

[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:57.769]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:30:58.089 --> 00:31:00.474]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:31:01.343 --> 00:31:02.344]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:31:02.584 --> 00:31:03.744]  What does freedom mean to you?
[00:31:04.084 --> 00:31:04.905]  The freedom to choose?
[00:31:04.965 --> 00:31:05.705]  The freedom to vote?
[00:31:05.925 --> 00:31:06.706]  The freedom to worship?
[00:31:06.946 --> 00:31:08.907]  How about the freedom to take control of your own future?

[00:33:01.315 --> 00:33:01.815]  Big Brother.
[00:33:01.835 --> 00:33:02.876]  Mainstream Media.
[00:33:12.365 --> 00:33:15.246]  Alright, look.
[00:33:15.266 --> 00:33:19.588]  This is what I'm gonna do.
[00:33:19.768 --> 00:33:22.209]  I'm gonna give the number out.
[00:33:34.793 --> 00:33:37.754]  And then after I go through some of the headlines, we're going to open the phones up.
[00:33:38.574 --> 00:33:40.374]  But I specifically want to hear from you.
[00:33:40.874 --> 00:33:46.516]  Are you hearing other talk radio or national news talk about they're very close to passing the Cybersecurity Act?
[00:33:46.556 --> 00:33:48.056]  They've been trying to pass for several years.
[00:33:48.676 --> 00:33:53.177]  And it's got a ban of all high-capacity magazines, the possession of them.
[00:33:53.517 --> 00:33:59.699]  And the way I read the bill, it could be interpreted in the rulemaking of the ATF, guns that take the mags.
[00:34:01.374 --> 00:34:05.979]  I mean, this is in the Hill Newspaper, AP, a few others, but that's it.
[00:34:07.561 --> 00:34:20.776]  And I listen to talk radio, and it's really bizarre how these people get their talking points, I guess, from Rupert Murdoch and Bill Kristol and Scalia, because it's not Democrats calling for gun control.
[00:34:21.747 --> 00:34:25.693]  On the news, it's the Republicans going, well, yeah, you could restrict guns.
[00:34:25.914 --> 00:34:28.758]  Come on, you don't need semi-auto for duck hunting.
[00:34:28.818 --> 00:34:29.319]  Ban it!
[00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:31.182]  It's time to turn them in!
[00:34:32.509 --> 00:34:35.191]  And the talk show hosts go, oh, well that's a change in the weather vane.
[00:34:35.571 --> 00:34:42.215]  I better just go ahead and... See, it's that wild card of suddenly having the people they love.
[00:34:42.395 --> 00:34:43.556]  Oh, Bill Kristol's my friend.
[00:34:43.936 --> 00:34:45.197]  Oh, Rupert Murdoch's my friend.
[00:34:45.678 --> 00:34:50.040]  Oh, Mitt Romney, yeah, he wanted to ban all semi-autos as governor of Massachusetts, but it's okay.
[00:34:50.421 --> 00:34:52.682]  I'm going to be getting into that after we get to your calls.
[00:34:52.702 --> 00:34:54.523]  I'm going to get into the details of it.
[00:34:55.584 --> 00:34:58.426]  Because I want to just give a hardcore focus, like 10-minute report.
[00:35:01.001 --> 00:35:04.844]  I'll do it at, say, 10 after, so next hour.
[00:35:05.364 --> 00:35:06.125]  There's a bunch of it.
[00:35:06.165 --> 00:35:06.865]  I want to go over it.
[00:35:06.885 --> 00:35:08.066]  I want to play this Scalia clip.
[00:35:08.887 --> 00:35:09.788]  Oh, there's a whole bunch of them.
[00:35:09.808 --> 00:35:11.529]  I've got to get it all together for the nightly news, too.
[00:35:11.729 --> 00:35:14.331]  All the clips of them calling to turn our guns in and how great it is.
[00:35:14.971 --> 00:35:27.641]  Cutting in Bill Kristol's comments and the comments by Rupert Murdoch with Michael Moore and Bloomberg on Piers Morgan.
[00:35:30.492 --> 00:35:32.333]  I mean, it's exactly the same fraud.
[00:35:33.634 --> 00:35:35.715]  And it really shows us how much trouble we're in.
[00:35:36.035 --> 00:35:38.016]  It's because America's waking up.
[00:35:38.256 --> 00:35:40.337]  It's because we're becoming a total gun culture.
[00:35:41.394 --> 00:35:52.538]  That they're hyping the end of the world statistically, and Kurt did a story yesterday titled, Establishment Circles the Wagons on Gun Control, and in it he found the Justice Department numbers.
[00:35:52.858 --> 00:35:58.559]  Since 1992, guess how much of an increase there's been in mass shootings in five or more people involved?
[00:35:58.759 --> 00:35:59.260]  Guess how much?
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:35:59.260]  0.1. 0.1.
[00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:06.152]  So there has been an increase, 0.1.
[00:36:06.772 --> 00:36:09.915]  And that's with advertising it and all the shoot-em-up games.
[00:36:10.176 --> 00:36:16.842]  And of course this guy was on a bunch of drugs, and he was going to some weird top Air Force scientist, and he was in a brain program.
[00:36:17.123 --> 00:36:18.564]  I mean, I've seen this over and over again.
[00:36:18.584 --> 00:36:20.927]  That's why even Larry Pratt's like, yeah, it's probably staged.
[00:36:21.387 --> 00:36:22.308]  Of course it is.
[00:36:22.588 --> 00:36:24.530]  The guy's so drugged up he can't even talk.
[00:36:24.931 --> 00:36:26.192]  And I said I'd get to the other news.
[00:36:26.292 --> 00:36:27.493]  It's just incredible.
[00:36:28.547 --> 00:36:31.408]  Here's the toll-free number, 800-259-9231.
[00:36:33.208 --> 00:36:46.872]  Is anybody concerned that they've introduced legislation to ban most guns in magazines, and that the UN's own official treaty said in Article 15, we will aid other states in their internal gun confiscation?
[00:36:48.613 --> 00:36:49.373]  I mean, this is big.
[00:36:49.773 --> 00:36:52.954]  They're admitting they're going to do internal gun confiscation.
[00:36:54.014 --> 00:36:56.855]  They're admitting that they want to ban our guns in this bill.
[00:36:57.708 --> 00:37:06.816]  They're out there saying, ban everything down to flintlocks, and the conservatives, the so-called conservatives, now we're just gonna ban semi-auto, not down to flintlocks.
[00:37:07.997 --> 00:37:14.223]  And this article talks about how the gunpowder is really explosives and we need to get rid of regular, you know, smokeless gunpowder.
[00:37:14.263 --> 00:37:23.832]  I mean, it is just an all-out hysteria while, here's the key, while the power structure arms to the teeth against us.
[00:37:29.363 --> 00:37:34.444]  We have the power structure arming to the teeth against us with high-tech weapons.
[00:37:34.464 --> 00:37:50.049]  I mean, I saw an article two weeks ago where the Army's deploying on the streets with a plasma laser beam that fires a laser beam at you that can burn you, but then through the laser beam, it's a particle weapon, they conduct a lightning bolt and just blow you to pieces.
[00:37:51.457 --> 00:37:54.179]  Literally, don't run, we are your friends and it disintegrates you.
[00:37:54.199 --> 00:37:57.361]  You explode like an oak tree hit by a bolt of lightning.
[00:37:57.821 --> 00:38:06.266]  And drones and weapons and space scanning cameras and NSA spying on us while the borders are wide open and they legalize the illegals.
[00:38:06.306 --> 00:38:08.608]  Just treason to my left, treason to my right.
[00:38:09.068 --> 00:38:13.533]  Because they're imploding the world economy by design and they know you're going to get really mad.
[00:38:13.833 --> 00:38:29.530]  And that's why DHS is gearing up for martial law, riot, you know, armored pillboxes, 450 million rounds of hollow point .40 cal, shotguns, helicopters, attack drones, combat mechs, ground robot trucks.
[00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:34.231]  Just total, total build-up for their enemy, the American people.
[00:38:34.411 --> 00:38:38.912]  While we're busy saluting the military every time we watch television, it's like, troops, troops, troops!
[00:38:38.932 --> 00:38:42.753]  I mean, if you study classic fascism or communism, authoritarianism, this is it.
[00:38:42.773 --> 00:38:48.595]  It's like the transition of America from freedom to some weird North Korean state.
[00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:54.054]  You turn on the Olympics, it's all the family's bad, women kissing, men humping each other.
[00:38:54.394 --> 00:38:54.995]  Oh, shut up!
[00:38:55.175 --> 00:38:58.038]  You know, let the family hour have men humping each other.
[00:38:59.098 --> 00:39:01.601]  Again, we're just under total bombardment assault.
[00:39:01.621 --> 00:39:16.214]  I mean, reading this Time Magazine, it's like bad-mouthing, homeschooling, just everything is just total, total evil.
[00:39:18.248 --> 00:39:21.610]  Everything in here is just... I mean, these are not liberals, folks.
[00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:22.730]  You've got to understand that.
[00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:26.732]  These are vicious, savage control freaks.
[00:39:27.572 --> 00:39:30.214]  Okay, let me just give you a smattering of what's in the news, okay?
[00:39:30.234 --> 00:39:31.934]  Let me just show you this.
[00:39:32.335 --> 00:39:34.516]  This is the type of stuff I deal with, that you deal with.
[00:39:34.536 --> 00:39:35.576]  I see this every day.
[00:39:37.437 --> 00:39:43.780]  At Penn's Statters New Government Gig.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.621]  A Penn Starters New Government Gig.
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:52.477]  Graham Spanner may have been ousted from his post at Penn State President over same
[00:39:54.082 --> 00:39:57.063]  Over sex abuse scandal that engulfed the university.
[00:39:57.623 --> 00:40:03.666]  Again, a Penn Starters New Government gig, Graham Spanier, is that how you pronounce it?
[00:40:04.046 --> 00:40:11.548]  May have been ousted from his post at Penn State President over the sex abuse scandal that engulfed the university.
[00:40:11.588 --> 00:40:16.570]  But it seems he's found a backup employer, the American taxpayer.
[00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:18.511]  Of course, he's now joined the Supreme Army.
[00:40:19.997 --> 00:40:21.518]  He should be a new TSA commander.
[00:40:21.558 --> 00:40:23.318]  They hire the Defrock Priest, the rapist.
[00:40:23.398 --> 00:40:23.838]  I mean, you know.
[00:40:24.399 --> 00:40:27.520]  Don't even do background checks on them, or they do to make sure they're criminals and hire them.
[00:40:30.401 --> 00:40:32.562]  Spanier was faulted.
[00:40:32.582 --> 00:40:33.282]  Is that how you pronounce it?
[00:40:33.462 --> 00:40:35.102]  S-P-A-N-I-E-R?
[00:40:35.122 --> 00:40:36.683]  Is that how you pronounce that, guys?
[00:40:37.303 --> 00:40:38.043]  Spanier, yeah.
[00:40:38.444 --> 00:40:46.467]  Was faulted in an internal Penn State report after former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky was convicted of child molestation.
[00:40:46.487 --> 00:40:47.247]  The report said
[00:40:47.907 --> 00:40:53.113]  The head coach Joe Paterno, Spanier, and others had helped cover up Sandusky's abuse.
[00:40:53.533 --> 00:41:02.783]  But then it goes on, he's now working at a secret homeland security project for the US government relating to national security, but they can't tell you!
[00:41:04.039 --> 00:41:11.565]  You know, where do people that cover up decades of children being raped and sold to donors to the university, because that's what this was.
[00:41:12.386 --> 00:41:15.048]  That's even come out in the local news, but that's been covered up as well.
[00:41:15.328 --> 00:41:15.909]  Where do you go?
[00:41:15.969 --> 00:41:18.571]  You go to the big pedophile command base in the sky!
[00:41:20.967 --> 00:41:21.868]  I mean, that's where you go.
[00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:25.992]  How many times have I told you it's a pedophile operation at the top?
[00:41:26.292 --> 00:41:29.715]  You don't get into the upper reaches of it unless you're part of that club.
[00:41:30.015 --> 00:41:31.417]  I mean, just look at all these people.
[00:41:31.457 --> 00:41:32.237]  Just look at them.
[00:41:32.618 --> 00:41:40.965]  Would you let any of the heads of Homeland Security, any of these government people, just look at their eyes, look at how they act, look at the head of the NSA, look at them all.
[00:41:41.186 --> 00:41:42.006]  And let me ask you something.
[00:41:42.367 --> 00:41:44.649]  Would you let your child be in a room alone with them?
[00:41:46.087 --> 00:41:50.811]  And the answer is, not just no, H-E double hockey sticks, no.
[00:41:53.533 --> 00:41:54.574]  Does your skin crawl?
[00:41:55.094 --> 00:41:55.834]  Well, it should.
[00:41:58.937 --> 00:42:00.978]  And roam before it collapses the same way.
[00:42:01.339 --> 00:42:02.640]  Usually these people take over.
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:07.343]  They've got to get in command to be able to brutalize, they really want to murder your children.
[00:42:07.603 --> 00:42:08.484]  Let's get that straight.
[00:42:09.305 --> 00:42:12.007]  Raping them is as much as they can hurt them without killing them.
[00:42:13.328 --> 00:42:14.609]  And believe me, they kill them too.
[00:42:15.429 --> 00:42:17.310]  These globalists love killing little kids.
[00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:26.974]  But until they get to that point, bombing of Dresden killed a couple hundred thousand kids in one night, beautiful to them.
[00:42:28.375 --> 00:42:28.835]  So there you go.
[00:42:28.895 --> 00:42:29.935]  Oh, but wait, there's more.
[00:42:29.955 --> 00:42:31.916]  This is in the Wall Street Journal, you name it.
[00:42:31.976 --> 00:42:35.378]  Mayor Bloomberg and the teachers unions protect pedophiles.
[00:42:35.938 --> 00:42:41.060]  And it goes on, a big report out in the Wall Street Journal today, how they just protect them and nobody gets in trouble.
[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:41.941]  And that's just the way it is.
[00:42:43.558 --> 00:42:43.938]  There you go.
[00:42:44.819 --> 00:42:47.180]  Oh, that's just one little group of articles there.
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:49.982]  Let me do a plug here, too, if you want to know more about this.
[00:42:50.802 --> 00:42:55.605]  There's two films on one DVD, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove and The Order of Death.
[00:42:57.126 --> 00:42:59.627]  And Bohemian Grove is going to end tomorrow.
[00:42:59.687 --> 00:43:01.929]  It's been going for the last week and a half or so.
[00:43:02.669 --> 00:43:07.852]  And the Christian conservative leaders predominantly ship in all the gay porn stars for themselves.
[00:43:07.872 --> 00:43:09.753]  That's not, you know, debated.
[00:43:09.793 --> 00:43:10.814]  That's even in Vanity Fair.
[00:43:12.719 --> 00:43:17.066]  I was like the cat in a cartoon with Pepe Le Pew chasing me the entire time when I was in there.
[00:43:17.466 --> 00:43:21.573]  I was only in there about four and a half hours being whistled at and all the rest of it.
[00:43:22.334 --> 00:43:25.459]  Yeah, world leaders, heads of companies whistling at me.
[00:43:26.934 --> 00:43:29.456]  Uh... and so that's basically what's going on there.
[00:43:29.936 --> 00:43:33.418]  But that's just the opening salvo, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:33.438 --> 00:43:39.001]  You have to understand of what really goes on inside of the globalist operations.
[00:43:39.761 --> 00:43:51.828]  So you need to get these at InfoWarshop.com and this is now back in print, expanded with a forward by Tex Mars, Mike Hanson who infiltrated Bohemian Grove with me.
[00:43:52.128 --> 00:43:53.209]  This is the only
[00:43:55.254 --> 00:44:01.963]  Modern, updated, very well-written, expansive book about Bohemian Grove, not just our infiltration.
[00:44:02.865 --> 00:44:05.228]  And it is Bohemian Grove, Cult of Conspiracy.
[00:44:05.248 --> 00:44:10.756]  You get a free citizen rulebook with it and more at infowarshop.com or you can get
[00:44:12.961 --> 00:44:17.685]  They're on the side a huge discount on the two films that go with it.
[00:44:17.945 --> 00:44:22.129]  You want to understand the how deep the rabbit hole goes.
[00:44:22.749 --> 00:44:26.512]  I mean, let me tell you somebody like Sandusky was just a dungeon keeper.
[00:44:26.933 --> 00:44:29.555]  So they're burning the dungeon keeper who supplied the kids.
[00:44:31.543 --> 00:44:35.048]  And again, John DeCant talked about this on my show more than a decade ago.
[00:44:35.068 --> 00:44:41.516]  I remember when he brought this up about Boys Town, later it came out it was true, and Penn State and the football program.
[00:44:41.536 --> 00:44:44.740]  I was like, let's stop right there, because that hadn't been in court yet.
[00:44:46.292 --> 00:44:48.294]  And everybody pointed it out and found those interviews.
[00:44:48.754 --> 00:44:53.820]  Folks, this has been going on, of course, local news reports, that's the word, is that Sandusky was supplying little kids.
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:45:00.447]  Really, I mean, he's raping them at high noon on, you know, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday mornings.
[00:45:00.747 --> 00:45:04.532]  I mean, he's raping little kids in the showers with people milling around.
[00:45:06.021 --> 00:45:08.582]  I mean, this is a giant nest of scum.
[00:45:09.442 --> 00:45:12.323]  I told you Paterno knew, and of course it came out he knew.
[00:45:12.423 --> 00:45:13.123]  Of course he knew.
[00:45:13.143 --> 00:45:16.784]  I mean, I can take one look at that guy and it makes my skin crawl.
[00:45:17.004 --> 00:45:19.085]  Don't you people have any discernment?
[00:45:20.485 --> 00:45:23.686]  I mean, you know, you don't just judge a book off its cover.
[00:45:23.846 --> 00:45:26.787]  It's the, it's the, it's a spiritual thing.
[00:45:26.827 --> 00:45:28.387]  You can literally just see them.
[00:45:29.207 --> 00:45:30.168]  I mean, look at Sandusky.
[00:45:30.208 --> 00:45:30.968]  He looks like
[00:45:33.370 --> 00:45:36.151]  Like a demonic ferret or a chipmunk or something.
[00:45:36.391 --> 00:45:43.035]  And, and, and, and, you know, oh, but I was wrong to say Joe Paul or whatever his stupid name was, his stupid nickname.
[00:45:43.395 --> 00:45:44.855]  They took down the statue, didn't they?
[00:45:45.336 --> 00:45:47.216]  I was right, you were wrong.
[00:45:47.677 --> 00:45:49.818]  I was right, you were wrong, okay?
[00:45:50.578 --> 00:45:52.339]  And it isn't about me being right here, okay?
[00:45:52.519 --> 00:45:56.781]  But I mean, you know, outside Bohemian Grove, repeatedly, little kids get kidnapped and killed and dumped out there.
[00:45:57.721 --> 00:45:58.762]  Pauly Closh, you name it.
[00:46:00.583 --> 00:46:03.964]  All the time, you see little kids getting grabbed and picked up.
[00:46:04.705 --> 00:46:12.408]  Folks, they're getting taken 9 times out of 10 for these people to literally rape the living daylights out of them and torture them for quite a period of time.
[00:46:13.502 --> 00:46:16.124]  It doesn't just stop with them raping little kids.
[00:46:16.144 --> 00:46:18.225]  They like to torture the living daylights out of them.
[00:46:18.245 --> 00:46:20.307]  Okay, that's who runs your government.
[00:46:20.607 --> 00:46:23.869]  Just get that straight and get that through your head and understand that real good and let that burn in.
[00:46:24.089 --> 00:46:26.471]  And as soon as they get their guns, they're going to turn hell loose on us.
[00:46:26.851 --> 00:46:32.495]  Texas Rangers tried to stop the public rape rooms at the Texas Youth Commission, where they were selling the kids.
[00:46:33.195 --> 00:46:36.438]  The judges and elitists would come down and pick which kid they wanted out of the different deals.
[00:46:36.638 --> 00:46:39.380]  They had gladiatorial fights, paying tickets.
[00:46:41.041 --> 00:46:42.462]  Texas Rangers tried to stop it.
[00:46:44.056 --> 00:46:45.536]  They got shut down, and you know what?
[00:46:45.596 --> 00:46:49.738]  The commission got taken over by the very same crew, and it's business as usual.
[00:46:50.418 --> 00:46:51.238]  Nothing's gonna stop.
[00:46:51.258 --> 00:46:58.080]  You're not gonna stop these people now that they're in power and in control from having their way with your children until they're fully removed.
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:00.240]  Do you know about CPS?
[00:47:01.141 --> 00:47:02.761]  Do you know what a bunch of pedophiles they are?
[00:47:03.461 --> 00:47:06.642]  Again, our so-called guardians are a bunch of scum.
[00:47:07.882 --> 00:47:12.144]  And until we come right out with it and admit how much trouble we're in, it's over.
[00:47:12.564 --> 00:47:13.144]  No future.
[00:47:15.979 --> 00:47:19.080]  Okay, I've now covered one little area of news here.
[00:47:24.822 --> 00:47:25.642]  Where should I start?
[00:47:25.682 --> 00:47:29.963]  I mean, there's just so much here that it makes my head spin.
[00:47:31.243 --> 00:47:32.324]  Oh, looky here!
[00:47:32.344 --> 00:47:37.725]  This is out of the New American, Fluoride Lowers IQ in Kids, New Study Shows.
[00:47:37.745 --> 00:47:39.666]  Yeah, what are there, hundreds of studies, literally?
[00:47:41.161 --> 00:47:43.984]  A review of some two dozen studies by Harvard University researchers.
[00:47:44.244 --> 00:47:45.105]  Oh, it's just Harvard.
[00:47:45.706 --> 00:47:52.514]  This month in a peer-reviewed federal journal suggests that fluoride added to water supplies significantly decreases the IQ of children.
[00:47:53.535 --> 00:47:57.760]  Yeah, that's why every store you go to they got bottled water that says extra fluoride for kids.
[00:47:59.258 --> 00:48:03.021]  That's why the kids, you know, it tastes like bubble gum, the toothpaste.
[00:48:03.142 --> 00:48:05.704]  I mean, there's a reason the public's mentally dumbed down.
[00:48:05.764 --> 00:48:13.911]  I mean, this was not, they didn't put it in the water at the Gulags under Lenin and Stalin and then Hitler because they wanted to, you know, take care of the inmates.
[00:48:20.157 --> 00:48:23.721]  Fluoride lowers IQs in kids, new study shows.
[00:48:24.807 --> 00:48:25.328]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[00:48:25.348 --> 00:48:26.089]  They're going to keep doing it.
[00:48:26.149 --> 00:48:29.473]  And if you go to your city council and say, I want this out, they're going to laugh at you.
[00:48:31.695 --> 00:48:32.556]  Until you sue them.
[00:48:32.957 --> 00:48:37.903]  They're assaulting you and your family, just like they want to get your kid in a room and blow their head off.
[00:48:39.517 --> 00:48:40.138]  Just like they wanted.
[00:48:40.158 --> 00:48:47.283]  These people, let me tell you, these people like to torture a kid for a couple months and just use them up, is what they call it, just savagely terrorizing them.
[00:48:47.544 --> 00:48:50.326]  And then they just chop them up with a meat cleaver and blow their head off.
[00:48:50.546 --> 00:48:51.087]  And you know what?
[00:48:51.127 --> 00:48:53.048]  I know you're not going to protect the children.
[00:48:53.268 --> 00:48:55.250]  It's too scary for mainline people.
[00:48:55.290 --> 00:49:04.478]  You're mainline, which means you're into picking up whatever the establishment says is the end thing and then following it, even though that establishment is a bunch of psycho killers.
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:19.626]  Fluoride seems to fit in with lead, mercury, and other poisons that causes chemical brain damage, noted senior study author Felipe Radjin, a professor of environmental health at Harvard.
[00:49:19.926 --> 00:49:31.752]  The effect of each toxicant may seem small, but the combined damage on the population scale can be serious, especially because the brain power of the next generation is crucial to all of us.
[00:49:32.093 --> 00:49:33.613]  No, it's not, buddy boy!
[00:49:33.633 --> 00:49:38.136]  They're spraying aluminum dioxide on us to make sure we can't escape.
[00:49:40.145 --> 00:49:42.746]  They've engineered all the GMO crops to attack our organs.
[00:49:45.586 --> 00:49:48.187]  Disorders of the gut are running rampant everywhere.
[00:49:48.527 --> 00:49:55.708]  I was at a business meeting last night at a restaurant slash bar and overheard two different people, one guy, I even talked to him.
[00:49:55.748 --> 00:49:59.329]  He's like, he's like, yeah, can we fix this plug?
[00:49:59.369 --> 00:50:00.889]  Is there something we can do with this little plug?
[00:50:00.929 --> 00:50:03.010]  Doesn't just pop out just constantly out of the thing.
[00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:04.090]  It's just driving me.
[00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:06.050]  I mean, it's, it just totally breaks my train of thought.
[00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:09.471]  I don't know what I'm going to do, but the point is that
[00:50:11.752 --> 00:50:16.393]  This guy's like, yeah, I gotta leave Austin, Texas and go back to Virginia or wherever it was.
[00:50:16.433 --> 00:50:17.854]  My dad's dying of Crohn's.
[00:50:17.874 --> 00:50:21.675]  And I heard somebody else talking about somebody in their family dying of it.
[00:50:21.695 --> 00:50:23.095]  It was unknown 50 years ago.
[00:50:23.476 --> 00:50:25.156]  They're just all, we're just all gonna die.
[00:50:25.436 --> 00:50:27.717]  Let a bunch of perverts run everything.
[00:50:27.737 --> 00:50:29.497]  And they're not even perverts.
[00:50:29.757 --> 00:50:30.998]  They'll have a Renfield type.
[00:50:32.051 --> 00:50:34.833]  Like Sandusky, who actually likes to rape kids.
[00:50:35.413 --> 00:50:38.955]  The globalists like to pull their teeth out with pliers and torture the hell out of them.
[00:50:38.995 --> 00:50:40.536]  I mean, that's really what they're into.
[00:50:41.036 --> 00:50:45.058]  By the way, I have a Dungeon Keeper article out of BuzzFeed report.
[00:50:45.178 --> 00:50:45.518]  U.S.
[00:50:45.578 --> 00:50:53.042]  General ignored Auschwitz-like conditions to help Obama, where people were being eaten by maggots in Afghanistan.
[00:50:53.683 --> 00:50:56.004]  The soldiers, everyone was starving to death.
[00:50:57.545 --> 00:50:58.425]  We'll get to that later.
[00:50:58.505 --> 00:51:00.186]  But that's a beautiful thing for them.
[00:51:00.486 --> 00:51:01.027]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.787 --> 00:51:02.788]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:51:03.008 --> 00:51:04.189]  What does freedom mean to you?
[00:51:04.209 --> 00:51:05.350]  The freedom to choose?
[00:51:05.410 --> 00:51:06.130]  The freedom to vote?
[00:51:06.351 --> 00:51:07.111]  The freedom to worship?
[00:51:07.351 --> 00:51:09.313]  How about the freedom to take control of your own future?

[00:53:04.917 --> 00:53:05.637]  That bears repeating.
[00:53:05.957 --> 00:53:09.481]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.

[00:54:10.433 --> 00:54:16.538]  Well, I just cover what I've discovered and what I've found and
[00:54:18.223 --> 00:54:23.849]  The evil we face is so over the top that only an immediate in its face...
[00:54:25.689 --> 00:54:27.831]  Awakening will give us any chance.
[00:54:28.531 --> 00:54:41.340]  I mean, the system is so evil, it's full of so many criminals, so many people that are so bad, words cannot describe it, that we've got to break with the system and realize it's alien, it's false, it's evil.
[00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:43.181]  It comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[00:54:43.842 --> 00:54:47.864]  The churches have been taken over, it's 24-7 government worship fest there.
[00:54:49.506 --> 00:54:51.167]  You should be offended by all of this.
[00:54:52.648 --> 00:54:53.288]  I know I am.
[00:54:54.209 --> 00:55:00.173]  And here they are hiring the Penn State President to work for Homeland Security, quote, in a secretive position.
[00:55:01.133 --> 00:55:04.435]  Just like they've hired all these pedophiles to run the TSA.
[00:55:04.635 --> 00:55:10.079]  Just like they busted the head of the Florida CPS a few years ago was a pedophile.
[00:55:10.139 --> 00:55:11.860]  And then it turned out their two deputies were.
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:13.681]  They're like, oh, there was no background check.
[00:55:13.941 --> 00:55:15.482]  Oh, there was a background check done.
[00:55:15.782 --> 00:55:18.064]  These people have taken over.
[00:55:19.192 --> 00:55:23.913]  They're buying weapons, they're using our money to arm against us, and getting the police trained to attack us.
[00:55:26.594 --> 00:55:29.275]  And I want to just tell the police, I know on average you're good men and women.
[00:55:31.095 --> 00:55:34.096]  And a lot of you got in there with a desire to do good, I know that.
[00:55:34.136 --> 00:55:37.557]  But a lot of you have been recruiting thugs now, and we're in deep trouble.
[00:55:37.817 --> 00:55:39.577]  And let me tell you, this country is going to fall.
[00:55:40.498 --> 00:55:44.759]  Alright, I said I'd go to your calls, and again, I've got like 20 stacks of news, I'm not exaggerating.
[00:55:45.968 --> 00:55:49.369]  There's power outages all over the country as they shut down coal power plants.
[00:55:50.350 --> 00:55:51.270]  China builds three a week.
[00:55:51.310 --> 00:55:52.451]  We can't even get two a year.
[00:55:52.491 --> 00:55:53.471]  We're just shutting down.
[00:55:53.691 --> 00:55:54.612]  I've got that news.
[00:55:54.632 --> 00:55:56.132]  370... Yeah, that's Associated Press.
[00:55:56.152 --> 00:56:03.075]  It says 370 Indianans, but it can't be 370 million.
[00:56:03.095 --> 00:56:03.375]  There's only...
[00:56:10.973 --> 00:56:12.193]  Oh yeah, that's in India, yeah.
[00:56:12.474 --> 00:56:13.434]  Yeah, that's another article.
[00:56:13.454 --> 00:56:14.974]  I was seeing that and I'm like, what are you talking about?
[00:56:15.015 --> 00:56:16.115]  Yeah.
[00:56:16.155 --> 00:56:17.215]  I'm talking about the Daily Caller.
[00:56:17.235 --> 00:56:18.536]  I'm talking about here in the United States.
[00:56:19.276 --> 00:56:21.877]  A record number of coal-fired generators to be shut down.
[00:56:21.897 --> 00:56:23.978]  There's power outages around different areas of the United States.
[00:56:24.558 --> 00:56:26.499]  Okay, let's go to Michael in Oklahoma.
[00:56:26.879 --> 00:56:27.879]  Michael, you're on the air.
[00:56:27.919 --> 00:56:28.239]  Welcome.
[00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:32.061]  Okay, you don't want to talk?
[00:56:32.981 --> 00:56:33.401]  Or you do?
[00:56:34.742 --> 00:56:35.802]  Okay, Michael's not there.
[00:56:35.882 --> 00:56:37.463]  Jason in New Hampshire, you're on the air.
[00:56:37.483 --> 00:56:37.823]  Go ahead.
[00:56:39.062 --> 00:56:39.982]  Hi, can you hear me?
[00:56:40.082 --> 00:56:40.302]  Yes.
[00:56:40.322 --> 00:56:41.783]  How are you doing Alex?
[00:56:42.223 --> 00:56:43.403]  I'm not doing too good.
[00:56:44.224 --> 00:56:46.485]  They're publicly hiring perverts to run everything.
[00:56:46.505 --> 00:56:48.725]  That's wrong.
[00:56:48.785 --> 00:56:56.248]  I mean, I listen to your show every day and I gotta tell you, I got the back of my car plastered with bumper stickers that I've gotten off you.
[00:56:56.268 --> 00:56:58.429]  Well thank you sir, we couldn't do it without you.
[00:56:58.449 --> 00:57:02.190]  And I just wanted to ask you a question.
[00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:05.011]  You know, I got pulled over a month ago
[00:57:06.383 --> 00:57:08.863]  In Wakefield, New Hampshire, for speeding.
[00:57:08.903 --> 00:57:09.744]  They said I was speeding.
[00:57:09.764 --> 00:57:16.245]  And, uh, they, uh, I had a returning vet, uh, that was just back, maybe not even a month.
[00:57:16.945 --> 00:57:22.226]  And, uh, it felt like a setup, because they came to the car, and they're like, uh, who's he?
[00:57:22.286 --> 00:57:22.706]  Who's he?
[00:57:22.726 --> 00:57:23.466]  And I'm like, I don't know.
[00:57:23.506 --> 00:57:24.526]  I picked him up hitchhiking.
[00:57:25.106 --> 00:57:33.728]  And, uh, they basically just, like, without pulling me out of the car, they basically told me to get out, and they searched my car, and they, in his backpack, he had needles and stuff.
[00:57:34.347 --> 00:57:38.433]  And they basically got me with, uh, everything that they got him with.
[00:57:38.494 --> 00:57:39.555]  And I didn't know what was going on.
[00:57:39.595 --> 00:57:40.276]  Well, that's easy.
[00:57:40.316 --> 00:57:42.239]  You just get a jury trial.
[00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:45.264]  And you go, hey, I just gave a hitchhiker a ride.
[00:57:45.284 --> 00:57:47.888]  And, uh, this feels like a setup.
[00:57:49.386 --> 00:57:55.512]  And I mean, if they did set you up, can you imagine how horrible the lives of those police are?
[00:57:55.532 --> 00:57:59.456]  I mean, folks, when you do stuff like that, you get bad mojo, okay?
[00:57:59.496 --> 00:58:01.298]  Karma, re-put you, so whatever you want to call it.
[00:58:01.318 --> 00:58:03.480]  I mean, you wonder why your life's so miserable.
[00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:09.766]  If you randomly pull people, you know, sit there and have one of your people out there as an informant and then do that to set people up,
[00:58:11.946 --> 00:58:12.626]  It's just incredible.
[00:58:12.666 --> 00:58:15.808]  But it might have just been that it was somebody they were tracking and they pulled you over.
[00:58:15.868 --> 00:58:19.871]  But, I mean, that'll be found not guilty by a jury trial very, very quickly.
[00:58:19.891 --> 00:58:23.493]  Yeah, and this might make you laugh a little bit.
[00:58:23.693 --> 00:58:33.499]  I mean, I was at the races in Loudoun a couple weeks ago, and state police, it's like New World Order times ten there, you know?
[00:58:33.519 --> 00:58:33.779]  No, no, no.
[00:58:33.839 --> 00:58:34.800]  This is the takeover.
[00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:38.642]  We're all being acclimated to martial law so the bankers can destroy the country.
[00:58:44.062 --> 00:58:48.008]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.377 --> 00:58:56.621]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[00:58:56.881 --> 00:58:59.083]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:58:59.283 --> 00:59:04.807]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure.
[00:59:05.007 --> 00:59:08.230]  And it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:11.572]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[00:59:11.852 --> 00:59:13.274]  There's no priming required.
[00:59:13.514 --> 00:59:15.575]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[00:59:15.795 --> 00:59:18.277]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[00:59:19.358 --> 00:59:20.679]  Easy to set up and use.
[00:59:20.879 --> 00:59:22.180]  Doesn't require electricity.
[00:59:22.301 --> 00:59:25.163]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:59:25.463 --> 00:59:28.646]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:59:28.846 --> 00:59:32.849]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:35.592]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:59:35.732 --> 00:59:37.053]  It's what my family uses.
[00:59:37.313 --> 00:59:40.536]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[00:59:40.616 --> 00:59:45.961]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[00:59:45.981 --> 00:59:47.602]  You can also call to order.
[00:59:47.862 --> 00:59:55.287]  888-253-3139 Waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network
[01:00:06.124 --> 01:00:10.288]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.948 --> 01:00:11.749]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.550 --> 01:00:13.431]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.091 --> 01:00:17.694]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.275 --> 01:00:22.339]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:39.741 --> 01:00:45.537]  Well, NYPD launched an all-seeing tracking system and they're hiring.
[01:00:46.641 --> 01:00:56.208]  All over the country, people like the President of Penn State who helped cover up that little operation, that little money-making operation, as part of a secretive Homeland Security group.
[01:00:56.929 --> 01:01:00.571]  And Big Sis has announced that 30,000 drones will be used for public safety.
[01:01:00.931 --> 01:01:02.713]  We had an article out on that on Friday.
[01:01:02.733 --> 01:01:05.475]  It was added into another article at Infowars.com.
[01:01:05.515 --> 01:01:06.796]  It got linked up at the Drugs Report.
[01:01:07.156 --> 01:01:08.677]  Drones will be used for public safety.
[01:01:09.277 --> 01:01:13.461]  But we have a separate article, not that one, that just focuses on that.
[01:01:14.602 --> 01:01:18.065]  That we're going to be covering after we go to some of your phone calls here.
[01:01:18.926 --> 01:01:31.279]  Walter in New Jersey, because I opened the phones up and the last caller, I wanted callers to call in about the fact they've introduced a bill to ban all semi-autos, basically, and the clips.
[01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:35.283]  And I didn't even know Michael Savage has endorsed this.
[01:01:37.145 --> 01:01:41.691]  Basically, all the so-called conservatives got desperate because they realized the whole game was up.
[01:01:41.711 --> 01:01:43.834]  Because America woke up and became pro-gun.
[01:01:44.174 --> 01:01:47.858]  So they're now flipping over, going, well, it's pro-gun to turn your guns in.
[01:01:47.878 --> 01:01:50.582]  And now I'm a liberal because I don't want to turn my guns in.
[01:01:50.842 --> 01:01:52.985]  Did you call in about that, Walter, or something else?
[01:01:53.935 --> 01:01:54.816]  Uh, yes I did.
[01:01:55.236 --> 01:01:58.059]  Alex, first-time caller, long-time listener and watcher.
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:05.565]  I was at Shantilly to sign my InfoWars flag on the last day down there back in June.
[01:02:06.766 --> 01:02:17.015]  Yes, as far as the cybersecurity bill is concerned, our two illustrious Senators Lautenberg and Menendez have signed on to this bill.
[01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:21.781]  And I sent them emails and I'm totally frustrated with this whole thing.
[01:02:22.201 --> 01:02:27.242]  But what I'd also like to know is, what happens if they knock on my door at 3am in the morning?
[01:02:27.262 --> 01:02:28.382]  Yeah, well I'm all geared up too.
[01:02:28.402 --> 01:02:29.342]  I pity the people that come in.
[01:02:47.609 --> 01:02:48.290]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:02:48.570 --> 01:02:49.690]  Sir, this is what's going to happen.
[01:02:50.311 --> 01:03:00.457]  If they start going into people's houses and shooting them up, and going after those that don't turn them in when the order comes, people aren't going to wait in their houses for the police.
[01:03:00.497 --> 01:03:02.338]  I mean, you understand that, right?
[01:03:02.979 --> 01:03:03.979]  I do understand that.
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:12.685]  I don't want to wait in my house, but if they start this, it's going to be really hard to get away in a car, and if they have roadblocks and all kinds of contingencies set up to
[01:03:13.513 --> 01:03:19.178]  But you understand a roadblock would be a death trap for those trying to take the guns, even if they've ordered the armored pillboxes.
[01:03:20.019 --> 01:03:20.760]  Oh, I think so.
[01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:24.143]  It's going to be like the Wild West out here or anywhere else.
[01:03:24.944 --> 01:03:34.913]  Well, I mean, look, I don't know how many people have studied guerrilla tactics, but I mean, it's 101 that, you know, they try to put people in re-education camps and arrest everybody.
[01:03:35.293 --> 01:03:37.135]  Folks aren't going to just sit in their houses.
[01:03:38.416 --> 01:03:39.217]  They're going to go out.
[01:03:40.868 --> 01:03:42.048]  And the police are getting ready for this.
[01:03:42.068 --> 01:03:44.289]  That's why they're all going to unmarks that aren't even marked.
[01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:47.250]  And this is all a covert takeover by foreign banks.
[01:03:47.530 --> 01:03:49.350]  America is being conquered right now.
[01:03:50.070 --> 01:03:51.571]  This is the fall of the republic.
[01:03:51.851 --> 01:03:53.091]  We were taken over from within.
[01:03:53.111 --> 01:03:56.052]  And I'm reaching out to military and police to understand that.
[01:03:56.872 --> 01:04:00.853]  But I mean, a lot of them are just going to salute because the bankers used the American flag.
[01:04:02.074 --> 01:04:02.854]  You understand that?
[01:04:03.334 --> 01:04:07.535]  I mean, a lot of them are on fluoride just like the general public and can hardly tie their shoelaces.
[01:04:07.555 --> 01:04:08.055]  But I'm sorry.
[01:04:08.075 --> 01:04:10.476]  Did you have anything else you wanted to add, my friend?
[01:04:11.571 --> 01:04:13.233]  Uh, no, that's pretty much it, Alex.
[01:04:13.293 --> 01:04:14.193]  Great job.
[01:04:14.213 --> 01:04:15.214]  I love watching your show.
[01:04:15.595 --> 01:04:16.676]  Well, thanks for putting up with me.
[01:04:16.696 --> 01:04:17.897]  I appreciate you, my friend.
[01:04:17.917 --> 01:04:26.824]  We're going to come back and try to hurry through Frank, Tim, Aaron, and Ghost Recon that are patiently holding.
[01:04:26.864 --> 01:04:29.426]  In fact, Ghost Recon's first, then Frank, Tim, and Aaron, and others.
[01:04:31.488 --> 01:04:34.070]  And I'll try to refocus here because there's a lot of news I need to hit.
[01:04:34.090 --> 01:04:36.932]  But I am going to get into the Second Amendment and play some clips coming up.
[01:04:36.952 --> 01:04:38.514]  We've got some economic news coming up.
[01:04:40.087 --> 01:04:43.371]  Quite frankly, again, they're just moving forward even though we're waking up.
[01:04:43.671 --> 01:04:50.498]  And they're planning to start a civil war between the police, military, and the American people, which is the plan of the bankers.
[01:04:51.199 --> 01:04:55.584]  Then bring in foreign troops after we've defeated our own military and police.
[01:05:03.627 --> 01:05:11.314]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.
[01:05:11.734 --> 01:05:15.358]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.
[01:05:15.818 --> 01:05:22.624]  These all-natural soaps are made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils that are earth-friendly and safe.
[01:05:23.124 --> 01:05:25.927]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[01:05:26.127 --> 01:05:30.630]  Or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[01:05:30.971 --> 01:05:36.635]  Buy the 1 to 2 month sample package and enjoy soaps that are twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:05:36.915 --> 01:05:42.019]  Or save big with a 1 to 2 year supply of soaps for all your cleaning needs.
[01:05:42.319 --> 01:05:43.941]  This is an amazing deal.
[01:05:44.301 --> 01:05:48.924]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.
[01:05:49.545 --> 01:05:51.707]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com
[01:05:52.267 --> 01:05:53.149]  Or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[01:06:01.172 --> 01:06:05.415]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:05.715 --> 01:06:06.335]  Number one.
[01:06:06.635 --> 01:06:09.777]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:10.058 --> 01:06:10.638]  Number two.
[01:06:10.918 --> 01:06:15.481]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:15.801 --> 01:06:16.262]  It's true.
[01:06:16.562 --> 01:06:21.105]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:21.425 --> 01:06:21.985]  Number three.
[01:06:22.245 --> 01:06:25.547]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:25.848 --> 01:06:29.530]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:29.730 --> 01:06:30.291]  Number 4.
[01:06:30.531 --> 01:06:32.893]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:33.293 --> 01:06:36.677]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:36.977 --> 01:06:37.197]  Number 5.
[01:06:37.778 --> 01:06:41.681]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:41.921 --> 01:06:46.686]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:06:46.966 --> 01:06:50.990]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:51.131 --> 01:06:52.692]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:52.932 --> 01:06:54.995]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:06:55.175 --> 01:06:57.517]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:07:01.257 --> 01:07:02.258]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:07:02.498 --> 01:07:03.639]  What does freedom mean to you?
[01:07:03.979 --> 01:07:04.820]  The freedom to choose?
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:05.620]  The freedom to vote?
[01:07:05.841 --> 01:07:06.621]  The freedom to worship?
[01:07:06.861 --> 01:07:08.823]  How about the freedom to take control of your own future?
[01:07:09.063 --> 01:07:14.227]  My friends at eFoods Direct are celebrating freedom this month while helping you take control of your greatest dependency, food.

[01:08:01.468 --> 01:08:06.533]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.873 --> 01:08:09.216]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:10.497 --> 01:08:12.419]  And we are back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:12.499 --> 01:08:15.201]  It is the best of times and the worst of times.
[01:08:17.403 --> 01:08:29.588]  The American people are waking up to the New World Order, to the global corporate takeover, to the eugenicist, to the fact that the Green Movement is just an authoritarian movement that could care less about the environment and public safety.
[01:08:30.548 --> 01:08:33.689]  Big Sis is announcing drones to be used for public safety.
[01:08:34.249 --> 01:08:37.331]  DHS spy in the sky to provide situational awareness.
[01:08:37.991 --> 01:08:45.654]  And they've got other bizarre quotes in here about, you know, total awareness and all this other bizarre garbage.
[01:08:46.741 --> 01:08:48.702]  So we're going to be breaking all of that down.
[01:08:49.163 --> 01:08:56.687]  But Paul Watson just put a new article up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com that really freaked me out.
[01:08:57.168 --> 01:09:00.290]  We were talking early this morning and he said, hey, what articles do you want me to look at today?
[01:09:00.310 --> 01:09:01.411]  And I said, well, what are you working on?
[01:09:01.431 --> 01:09:05.573]  Because most of the time he basically comes up with his own direction.
[01:09:05.613 --> 01:09:08.235]  But he'll ask me which direction we should go in.
[01:09:08.775 --> 01:09:10.977]  And I said, well, I don't see any coverage.
[01:09:12.367 --> 01:09:14.849]  Other than the Drudge Report and InfoWars.
[01:09:14.889 --> 01:09:16.790]  DrudgeReport.com, InfoWars.com.
[01:09:17.371 --> 01:09:21.074]  I don't hear it on talk radio, not last week, not over the weekend, not today.
[01:09:22.775 --> 01:09:28.319]  Where they're talking about all these top Republicans saying ban semi-auto weapons.
[01:09:28.379 --> 01:09:28.920]  Turn them in!
[01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:34.104]  And we've got legislation introduced now, racing through the House and Senate.
[01:09:34.935 --> 01:09:41.702]  To ban all clips above 10 rounds, possession of them, and to restrict devices, guns that can take them.
[01:09:42.002 --> 01:09:44.144]  I mean, this is one of the biggest gun bans I've ever even heard of.
[01:09:44.465 --> 01:09:46.327]  This is what Michael Moore is calling for.
[01:09:48.243 --> 01:09:54.484]  And I've played the clips here last week of Bill Kristol and all the rest of them saying, you don't need semi-auto, let's ban them.
[01:09:55.345 --> 01:09:58.185]  And saying, come on Democrats, we're gonna support you, don't back off this.
[01:09:58.665 --> 01:10:05.647]  Because the whole power structure is now showing their cards that they really fight with each other over power, but not over the direction they wanna go in.
[01:10:07.567 --> 01:10:11.168]  I mean, Charlton Heston, God bless him, great actor, been on my show a couple times.
[01:10:12.168 --> 01:10:14.308]  He supported the 67 Gun Control Act.
[01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:16.489]  When I first heard that, I didn't believe it.
[01:10:17.816 --> 01:10:20.277]  And somewhere years ago I found the TV ad.
[01:10:20.937 --> 01:10:22.438]  I've got it somewhere here in the office.
[01:10:22.778 --> 01:10:25.559]  We've got like huge storage rooms of tapes and stuff.
[01:10:26.219 --> 01:10:29.520]  Him on TV promoting the 68 gun control act, not 67.
[01:10:34.662 --> 01:10:38.625]  That's an example of how they use the people we trust most.
[01:10:39.285 --> 01:10:41.166]  And I don't think Charlton Heston was a bad guy.
[01:10:41.206 --> 01:10:44.709]  He was just, you know, being sold the idea that it was reasonable to do this.
[01:10:45.309 --> 01:10:51.614]  No, ladies and gentlemen, they want semi-autos because they're what can resist a military and foreign takeover.
[01:10:53.014 --> 01:10:55.816]  It's not the quote assault rifles that are being used in the crimes.
[01:10:56.097 --> 01:11:00.940]  They've picked those because most guns are semi-auto and they're calling all of those assault rifles.
[01:11:02.816 --> 01:11:08.238]  Now, I was reading Paul's article when it went up about 10 minutes ago during the last couple breaks and I was going through the clips.
[01:11:08.438 --> 01:11:11.339]  I didn't know Michael Savage had called for banning all semi-autos.
[01:11:11.379 --> 01:11:14.681]  There's a video link, an audio link to it.
[01:11:16.221 --> 01:11:17.822]  Technically, it's audio put to YouTube.
[01:11:18.782 --> 01:11:22.984]  I mean, it's a lot worse than I even knew.
[01:11:26.345 --> 01:11:26.705]  There it is.
[01:11:26.765 --> 01:11:28.266]  Michael Savage calls for gun control.
[01:11:28.306 --> 01:11:30.227]  Folks, I mean, he was a beatnik in the 60s.
[01:11:32.076 --> 01:11:40.139]  And I'm not going to get into Michael Savage bashing fest here, but I remember him saying, if you disagree with the government and we're a 9-11 traitor, you should be put in a forced labor camp five years ago.
[01:11:41.539 --> 01:11:49.402]  And I remember him saying... I certainly... Yeah, we'll play that coming up here in a little while.
[01:11:50.323 --> 01:11:53.764]  But we've got a whole bunch of these, a whole bunch of these clips.
[01:11:57.331 --> 01:12:01.776]  And see, now we're going to be called the liberals and the communists because we don't want to turn our guns in.
[01:12:01.796 --> 01:12:03.438]  And I'm not joking, by the way, about that.
[01:12:04.158 --> 01:12:08.704]  You tell mainline conservatives on Fox News to turn their guns in, half of them will do it.
[01:12:10.125 --> 01:12:13.369]  And again, they wouldn't have come out like this on a major talking point.
[01:12:16.386 --> 01:12:29.116]  If the system wasn't desperate and knowing they're getting ready to collapse everything, and Michael Savage and all of them are showing the system that if they go to martial law in October, launch an Iran war, stage a bunch of stuff, that they're going to toe the line.
[01:12:29.456 --> 01:12:32.999]  When they get ready to drop the hammer, folks, is when you start seeing behavior like this.
[01:12:35.141 --> 01:12:40.005]  If you want to see all the video and hear all the audio and all its horror, go to InfoWars.com.
[01:12:41.025 --> 01:12:43.908]  Why are Republicans calling to disarm the American people?
[01:12:44.738 --> 01:12:52.885]  While the federal government is arming itself with the teeth against conservatives, Paul Joseph Watson, and saying that we're their number one enemy, real constitutionalist.
[01:12:53.585 --> 01:12:58.989]  The recent deluge of attacks against the Second Amendment were completely predictable in the aftermath of the Colorado Massacre.
[01:12:59.310 --> 01:13:04.594]  But what perhaps wasn't so expected was the fact that a lot of them have come from so-called Republicans.
[01:13:04.854 --> 01:13:12.460]  Yeah, I heard so-called conservative talk show hosts this morning going, yeah, we may have to restrict, yeah, we may have to have security in the movies.
[01:13:13.681 --> 01:13:15.602]  Mass shootings are flat in the last 20 years.
[01:13:15.622 --> 01:13:16.622]  They're incredibly rare.
[01:13:17.042 --> 01:13:18.283]  But again, they're creating this fear.
[01:13:18.563 --> 01:13:21.104]  The TSA is now saying, well, we'll be in the shopping malls now.
[01:13:21.604 --> 01:13:23.105]  I told you that rollout was happening.
[01:13:23.645 --> 01:13:25.205]  They were getting ready months ago for the rollout.
[01:13:25.406 --> 01:13:28.787]  This is all timed, just like the underwear bomber was put on the plane by the U.S.
[01:13:28.827 --> 01:13:33.148]  government a week before the scanners were set to roll out January 1st.
[01:13:33.188 --> 01:13:41.392]  And they actually said on the news, oh, they're putting them in now because of this, when they started manufacturing them and put the order in 14 months before.
[01:13:41.452 --> 01:13:42.132]  It's all scripted.
[01:13:43.765 --> 01:13:44.766]  But this is a big victory.
[01:13:45.026 --> 01:13:51.249]  When they say, Hal Guns won, and they panic at the cover of Time Magazine and say, what are we going to do?
[01:13:52.090 --> 01:13:53.270]  They don't want to turn their guns in.
[01:13:53.290 --> 01:13:53.931]  They're crazy.
[01:13:54.971 --> 01:13:56.672]  No, it's because we know you're authoritarians.
[01:13:57.393 --> 01:14:01.175]  But now, the Weekly Standard's calling for it.
[01:14:01.495 --> 01:14:02.215]  Turning your guns.
[01:14:02.275 --> 01:14:03.176]  Ban all semi-autos.
[01:14:03.216 --> 01:14:03.836]  Bill Kristol.
[01:14:04.356 --> 01:14:05.177]  Michael Savage.
[01:14:05.637 --> 01:14:06.578]  Bill O'Reilly.
[01:14:07.798 --> 01:14:08.739]  Rupert Murdoch.
[01:14:10.675 --> 01:14:13.877]  Scalia's like, well hey, you can restrict stuff if it's scary.
[01:14:13.897 --> 01:14:24.103]  And he lists some colony ruling about going around with a special axe for chopping heads off and menacing people with it.
[01:14:24.383 --> 01:14:26.304]  You can't menace somebody with a firearm.
[01:14:26.584 --> 01:14:31.227]  Scalia, you're a lawyer, you're a Supreme Court Justice, you know you're lying to people, you sack of trash.
[01:14:32.421 --> 01:14:35.742]  You know full well those colony laws were about menacing.
[01:14:36.202 --> 01:14:37.483]  We have the same laws today.
[01:14:37.503 --> 01:14:47.146]  If I go out in the street with a battle axe and menace people and threaten them with it, that's disorderly conduct and that's, I looked it up, that's what they're talking about.
[01:14:47.506 --> 01:14:49.626]  But he's like, you can't have something that's scary.
[01:14:51.207 --> 01:14:52.607]  We have the clip, we'll play it in a moment.
[01:14:54.248 --> 01:14:54.928]  But you can read it.
[01:15:00.723 --> 01:15:07.027]  Although normally aligned with the right to keep and bear arms, over the last week, numerous self-proclaimed conservatives have proven themselves to be wolves in sheep's clothing.
[01:15:07.308 --> 01:15:10.710]  Well, yeah, George W. Bush tried to get the assault weapons ban reauthorized.
[01:15:11.650 --> 01:15:18.375]  And I was in McBride's gun shop talking to one of the guys who was a listener, and I said, yeah, I can't believe Bush is supporting it, but what do you expect?
[01:15:18.815 --> 01:15:20.537]  And the guy's like, hey, buddy, don't you say that about Bush.
[01:15:21.591 --> 01:15:23.933]  And the owner comes over and goes, no, actually he is supporting it.
[01:15:23.953 --> 01:15:24.614]  And they're like, really?
[01:15:24.674 --> 01:15:25.995]  But still, the guy was mad at me.
[01:15:26.695 --> 01:15:27.096]  I get it.
[01:15:27.196 --> 01:15:28.757]  You don't really want the Second Amendment.
[01:15:29.017 --> 01:15:30.138]  You don't really want freedom.
[01:15:30.518 --> 01:15:32.840]  You want to feel like the Republican Party is going to save you.
[01:15:34.101 --> 01:15:37.644]  Mitt Romney, who supports an assault weapons ban, which means all semi-auto.
[01:15:37.984 --> 01:15:39.325]  Notice how they manipulate the language.
[01:15:45.282 --> 01:15:46.363]  They're all calling for it.
[01:15:46.983 --> 01:15:56.209]  I mean, this has got just page after page after page after page of Republican leaders calling.
[01:15:56.569 --> 01:16:00.131]  And Bill Kristol's like, hey, we support you, Obama.
[01:16:00.851 --> 01:16:01.932]  We'll get behind you.
[01:16:02.032 --> 01:16:03.033]  Let's ban it now.
[01:16:04.127 --> 01:16:12.193]  Because they're so upset they know that a bunch of freshman Republicans are going to come in in the House, may even take the Senate, and they're freaked out bad.
[01:16:12.634 --> 01:16:22.962]  Real conservatives and libertarians and constitutionalists, if they don't have total election fraud, which they're going to pull, are taking over the states, the counties, the cities, and even Congress, and they're scared.
[01:16:23.382 --> 01:16:27.906]  Boehner, whose anti-gun is in trouble, there's revolts against Boehner.
[01:16:30.737 --> 01:16:32.198]  They are upset right now.
[01:16:32.298 --> 01:16:35.519]  They see the whole momentum teeter-tottering against them.
[01:16:35.799 --> 01:16:38.661]  A real counter-revolution against their globalist takeover.
[01:16:40.102 --> 01:16:48.946]  And let me tell you, these guys have either got mistresses, or boyfriends, or they have been insider trading, and it is blackmail.
[01:16:49.887 --> 01:16:51.989]  It is blackmail, except for people like Crystal.
[01:16:52.269 --> 01:16:54.070]  His dad was the head of the Trotskyites.
[01:16:54.090 --> 01:16:56.252]  I mean, do you know about the neocons?
[01:16:56.912 --> 01:17:03.577]  They were kicked out by Stalin, Trotsky was their leader, and Mr. Crystal's father was the head when Trotsky was killed.
[01:17:04.721 --> 01:17:08.024]  And they said, we can't take over as communists.
[01:17:08.064 --> 01:17:08.925]  America doesn't like that.
[01:17:09.005 --> 01:17:10.346]  We will take over the conservatives.
[01:17:10.746 --> 01:17:13.008]  These are communists, okay?
[01:17:14.329 --> 01:17:15.530]  Let me explain that to you here.
[01:17:15.751 --> 01:17:17.532]  I mean, people are like, oh yeah, no.
[01:17:17.972 --> 01:17:20.715]  Crystal's a good guy because he bashes Democrats all day.
[01:17:21.535 --> 01:17:26.740]  Let me tell you, folks, they have an old scam where they'll have a beautiful woman act like a man is
[01:17:28.658 --> 01:17:47.239]  Slapping her around in a parking lot in front of another man who's their mark, you know, they'll wait by your nice car and then she'll be like stop it and then you'll say hey stop that and the guy will run off and then she gets in the car and then puts a gun to your head and takes you to your house where you know he's following to totally steal everything you got and that's all this is.
[01:17:48.926 --> 01:17:57.428]  You know, Bill Kristol with lipstick on, with a blonde wig on, and he's there with Obama going, get your hands off me!
[01:17:57.728 --> 01:17:59.748]  Get your hands off me!
[01:18:00.509 --> 01:18:10.571]  And you finally woke up to this, and so she's basically, Mrs. Kristol, is basically running defense for him.
[01:18:11.647 --> 01:18:14.368]  And he's like, it's reasonable to ban the shimmy on oath.
[01:18:14.528 --> 01:18:15.329]  Come on.
[01:18:15.689 --> 01:18:17.069]  Come on.
[01:18:17.690 --> 01:18:19.450]  Offshore banks rob the country.
[01:18:19.671 --> 01:18:21.551]  We're not going to convert this takeover.
[01:18:21.591 --> 01:18:22.832]  It's my empire.
[01:18:24.012 --> 01:18:25.093]  Pax Americana.
[01:18:25.353 --> 01:18:29.135]  We're not going to get what we want if they're buying three, four million guns a month.
[01:18:36.112 --> 01:18:36.612]  It's over.
[01:18:36.692 --> 01:18:39.974]  I mean, Larry Pratt has come out and said it looks like Colorado's staged.
[01:18:40.574 --> 01:18:43.415]  I got basically no backlash from coming out and breaking that down.
[01:18:43.795 --> 01:18:44.975]  Everybody I know agrees with me.
[01:18:45.276 --> 01:18:46.076]  It's over.
[01:18:47.636 --> 01:18:54.359]  All you got left is starting a war with Russia, or Iran, or both, to get us to rally around your tyranny.
[01:18:54.779 --> 01:18:59.001]  All you've got left is staging a bunch of terror attacks, and our people are watching everywhere now.
[01:18:59.361 --> 01:19:01.822]  When you got drugged up Muttalib on the plane, we were watching.
[01:19:03.083 --> 01:19:09.065]  We know you drugged up the McDonald's killer, the evil Ronald McDonald guy that can't talk, he's so drugged up.
[01:19:09.885 --> 01:19:11.826]  We know he's got a psych warfare chief over him.
[01:19:15.086 --> 01:19:15.807]  I mean, we know.
[01:19:15.947 --> 01:19:18.187]  Look, look, look, look, look.
[01:19:19.228 --> 01:19:22.269]  Go ahead, I wish you would, go ahead and stage your mass shootings.
[01:19:22.649 --> 01:19:27.050]  I've said theaters, shopping malls, because I see the TSA rollout, police stations.
[01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:28.290]  Go ahead and stage them.
[01:19:33.123 --> 01:19:36.586]  I guess that's what you do, but we're going to be here exposing you every step of the way.
[01:19:36.666 --> 01:19:37.306]  Okay, terrorists?
[01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:41.369]  This is a foreign banking hijacking takeover of the Republic.
[01:19:43.010 --> 01:19:43.711]  It's that simple.
[01:19:44.171 --> 01:19:45.292]  This is how America dies.
[01:19:45.312 --> 01:19:46.493]  This is how it gets infiltrated.
[01:19:46.713 --> 01:19:47.814]  This is how it gets taken over.
[01:19:48.354 --> 01:19:48.655]  Okay?
[01:19:48.675 --> 01:19:50.196]  By foreign banks that brag they've done it.
[01:19:50.216 --> 01:19:53.798]  I'm going to finish up with the guns, then go to your phone calls, I promise.
[01:19:54.359 --> 01:19:57.801]  We're going to get to Ghost Recon, Frank, everybody.
[01:19:57.982 --> 01:19:59.483]  But I'm going to finish up the gun news.
[01:20:01.820 --> 01:20:05.461]  For more than six years, I've talked on the air about creating a social network.
[01:20:05.701 --> 01:20:08.362]  PlanetInfoWars.com is in its beta phase.
[01:20:08.642 --> 01:20:09.562]  We're just launching it.
[01:20:09.682 --> 01:20:13.764]  And I want to invite all of you out there to be in on the ground level.
[01:20:13.844 --> 01:20:23.627]  PlanetInfoWars is about people coming together, forming activist organizations, getting involved politically, hunting and fishing, gardening, dating.

[01:20:45.214 --> 01:20:45.854]  Be active.
[01:20:46.114 --> 01:20:46.734]  Organize.
[01:20:47.054 --> 01:20:47.795]  Take action.
[01:20:47.835 --> 01:20:48.495]  Go viral.
[01:20:48.795 --> 01:20:49.235]  Create.

[01:20:50.336 --> 01:20:50.836]  Resist.
[01:20:51.096 --> 01:20:53.457]  Because resistance is victory.

[01:21:14.150 --> 01:21:18.672]  T-Gen is an all-natural formula that contains ingredients proven to boost your own testosterone.
[01:21:18.932 --> 01:21:24.234]  Not only that, but these ingredients were shown to increase your sexual desire, enhance muscle growth with exercise,
[01:21:24.494 --> 01:21:24.874]  I think so.
[01:21:47.995 --> 01:21:53.456]  In a study of exercising men using the ingredient in TGen, a majority reported an improvement in sexual desire.

[01:23:00.558 --> 01:23:00.938]  Hi there.
[01:23:01.539 --> 01:23:02.619]  My name is Frank Bates.
[01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:06.282]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[01:23:06.902 --> 01:23:15.688]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[01:23:16.048 --> 01:23:22.072]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[01:23:22.773 --> 01:23:24.334]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[01:23:24.954 --> 01:23:30.038]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[01:23:30.758 --> 01:23:37.820]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:43.601]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[01:23:44.281 --> 01:23:50.162]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[01:23:50.762 --> 01:23:56.103]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[01:23:56.483 --> 01:23:57.644]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[01:24:16.224 --> 01:24:28.088]  So what's happened here is the ruling class, empowered by the offshore banks that control the issuance of currency and credit, have signed us on to their 1.5 quadrillion.
[01:24:30.046 --> 01:24:35.488]  Globally, they say in the Washington Post, our share is 644 Trill, even though we don't owe it.
[01:24:35.548 --> 01:24:37.489]  We owe 15 Trill through fraud to these people.
[01:24:38.069 --> 01:24:39.030]  They should all go to jail.
[01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:41.211]  But instead, they know you're waking up.
[01:24:41.431 --> 01:24:42.891]  They know that everybody's angry.
[01:24:43.332 --> 01:24:44.632]  These people are not invincible.
[01:24:45.773 --> 01:24:49.194]  I notice the churches are all 24-7 saying the rapture is about to happen.
[01:24:49.574 --> 01:24:54.256]  On all my articles and videos talking about this, it's, the rapture is tomorrow, the rapture is tomorrow.
[01:24:54.436 --> 01:24:55.897]  Guaranteed, that's a government bot.
[01:24:56.598 --> 01:24:57.959]  Just like, no, don't stand up!
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:24:58.920]  Don't get involved!
[01:24:59.161 --> 01:24:59.821]  No, no, no, no!
[01:25:00.162 --> 01:25:00.862]  Evil is coming!
[01:25:00.902 --> 01:25:01.743]  It's of the Lord!
[01:25:01.803 --> 01:25:02.664]  You can't resist it!
[01:25:02.684 --> 01:25:05.427]  You know, the Founding Fathers were wrong to stand up against it!
[01:25:05.687 --> 01:25:06.528]  Romans 13!
[01:25:06.588 --> 01:25:06.888]  Romans 13!
[01:25:07.409 --> 01:25:07.689]  Romans 13!
[01:25:07.809 --> 01:25:11.213]  I mean, they're entering the crisis zone!
[01:25:12.605 --> 01:25:20.208]  They staged this event, it totally freaked them out, whether he's total mind control or he's a drugged up patsy, which is in Northwoods.
[01:25:20.528 --> 01:25:21.469]  It's staged either way.
[01:25:22.089 --> 01:25:25.991]  Guaranteed, as I told you in all the tell-tale signs, it's ridiculous how obvious this is.
[01:25:26.091 --> 01:25:30.593]  I'll come out to the point again where Larry Pratt has to say it looks like an inside job and he's joining us.
[01:25:33.027 --> 01:25:37.269]  And so now you have from Scalia, and he did the lightest.
[01:25:37.369 --> 01:25:44.872]  I mean, some of these people, like Crystal and Savage, said just ban semi-auto, which is what Michael Moore and them are saying.
[01:25:45.232 --> 01:25:47.754]  So you see the power structure circling the wagons.
[01:25:47.854 --> 01:25:49.014]  Kurt's term for it is right.
[01:25:49.614 --> 01:25:50.415]  Because they get it.
[01:25:50.455 --> 01:25:52.696]  They're like, whoa, everybody wants a gun.
[01:25:52.996 --> 01:25:54.797]  Black, white, Hispanic, Asian.
[01:25:55.197 --> 01:25:56.697]  Everybody doesn't trust the government now.
[01:25:58.198 --> 01:26:02.547]  The people are losing their trust in us and they're quickly radicalizing.
[01:26:02.908 --> 01:26:05.393]  All their internal manuals and public statements say that.
[01:26:06.363 --> 01:26:08.484]  And again, they expected to have this war with us.
[01:26:08.504 --> 01:26:10.206]  They expected to start this civil war.
[01:26:10.486 --> 01:26:17.250]  They're buying the hundreds of millions of hollow points, the armored vehicles, the pillboxes, the checkpoints, the highway dividers.
[01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:22.594]  They got troops rolling around all over the country on the news, setting up weird checkpoints.
[01:26:22.854 --> 01:26:23.695]  Hey, what's that, daddy?
[01:26:23.995 --> 01:26:24.996]  Oh, it's just the army.
[01:26:25.016 --> 01:26:27.557]  And the military just looks at you, getting you ready.
[01:26:27.578 --> 01:26:30.239]  I mean, they're acclimating everybody.
[01:26:30.339 --> 01:26:30.740]  For what?
[01:26:31.963 --> 01:26:34.864]  Giant wars with Iran, with Russia coming into it.
[01:26:35.204 --> 01:26:41.326]  And then everybody will be like, I don't like Obama or I don't like Romney, but we're in a war!
[01:26:41.706 --> 01:26:43.847]  I guess Crystal says I gotta turn it in.
[01:26:45.428 --> 01:26:49.389]  Iranian Hezbollah sleeper cells shot up 20 theaters yesterday.
[01:26:50.169 --> 01:26:52.730]  I guess we can't be trusted, we gotta turn them in.
[01:26:53.210 --> 01:26:56.211]  I guess, folks, it isn't gonna be Hezbollah that does that.
[01:26:56.511 --> 01:26:57.752]  It's gonna be Banker-la.
[01:27:00.145 --> 01:27:08.096]  Hezbollah, Hezbollah Federal Reserve, Al-Qaeda, the same jihadis that got taken over Libya and Syria.
[01:27:08.457 --> 01:27:10.059]  Grow up folks or be slaves.
[01:27:10.399 --> 01:27:12.182]  Grow up and admit how much trouble we're in.
[01:27:12.502 --> 01:27:15.627]  I'm up here risking my life, believe it, every day.
[01:27:18.547 --> 01:27:21.329]  And the NSA, Spiles and everything, they know how big this show is.
[01:27:21.369 --> 01:27:24.512]  I don't really brag about it, folks, because it's freaking me out, because I'm just an average person.
[01:27:25.312 --> 01:27:28.755]  Everywhere I go, anywhere in the country now, every other person is a listener.
[01:27:29.055 --> 01:27:30.236]  I cannot walk down the street.
[01:27:30.516 --> 01:27:32.117]  I cannot go to the bathroom at a restaurant.
[01:27:32.438 --> 01:27:34.900]  I cannot go anywhere, anywhere.
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:36.521]  I can go to Central America.
[01:27:36.821 --> 01:27:37.702]  I can go to England.
[01:27:38.222 --> 01:27:40.164]  It isn't every 20 people stop like it was.
[01:27:40.444 --> 01:27:41.605]  Now it's every other person.
[01:27:41.885 --> 01:27:42.746]  Let me tell you something, folks.
[01:27:42.806 --> 01:27:44.367]  The signal of liberty got out there.
[01:27:47.045 --> 01:27:49.187]  And these tyrants are coming down on us like a ton of bricks.
[01:27:49.387 --> 01:27:50.848]  Let's play part of Scalia.
[01:27:52.069 --> 01:27:54.690]  Going, well, yeah, you can't scare people.
[01:27:55.171 --> 01:27:56.512]  No, no, you can't menace people.
[01:27:56.552 --> 01:27:58.693]  It's not that the axe is illegal, it's the menacing.
[01:27:59.634 --> 01:28:02.135]  And so, you don't want to have a rocket launcher.
[01:28:02.236 --> 01:28:04.577]  We can't have a rocket launcher, Scalia.
[01:28:05.658 --> 01:28:10.962]  I see people getting arrested for buying them at the Army-Navy stores, the empty ones that are one-time use.
[01:28:11.442 --> 01:28:15.325]  And there's no law, but the jury still sends you to jail, even though the rocket launcher's legal.
[01:28:16.104 --> 01:28:23.654]  When I was a kid, my mom, a beggar, would take me to the Army-Navy store and I'd get a defused hand grenade with no explosive in it.
[01:28:24.354 --> 01:28:25.756]  I'd get a LAWS rocket.
[01:28:26.850 --> 01:28:27.531]  Army helmet.
[01:28:27.571 --> 01:28:28.392]  The other kids had them.
[01:28:28.412 --> 01:28:30.013]  We'd run around the woods all day.
[01:28:30.394 --> 01:28:35.659]  She's like, you won't run around and mess up the house if I buy you the, if I buy you the old, you know, the hand grenade?
[01:28:35.979 --> 01:28:40.464]  Nowadays, folks, they're arresting people that have them on their desk after 25 years.
[01:28:41.084 --> 01:28:42.426]  It's an empty hand grenade.
[01:28:42.686 --> 01:28:43.947]  No explosive, no nothing.
[01:28:44.167 --> 01:28:46.009]  It's an empty fragmentation hand grenade.
[01:28:46.190 --> 01:28:48.552]  They're arresting people for those, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:52.796 --> 01:28:56.379]  I mean, I mean, it's the funnest thing I ever did running around with an old plastic Laws Rocket.
[01:28:56.399 --> 01:28:57.940]  I think some kid came over and stole it.
[01:28:58.220 --> 01:28:59.461]  I had that thing for like three years.
[01:29:01.142 --> 01:29:04.405]  Let me tell you, it was fun running around on the golf course with the Laws Rocket.
[01:29:06.326 --> 01:29:12.611]  And the point is that just last month in California, a kid had a spent Laws Rocket they bought.
[01:29:13.712 --> 01:29:15.033]  They arrested the dad, everybody.
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:19.422]  And they said, well, they're still going to jail because they had a BB gun, too.
[01:29:19.682 --> 01:29:21.183]  BB gun wasn't illegal in LA.
[01:29:21.603 --> 01:29:22.724]  They don't care.
[01:29:22.924 --> 01:29:24.405]  They're coming after our guns.
[01:29:25.726 --> 01:29:27.707]  I'm going to come back and play Scalia and then go to your phone calls.
[01:29:28.567 --> 01:29:30.128]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is not a game.
[01:29:30.148 --> 01:29:30.909]  This is not a joke.
[01:29:30.929 --> 01:29:31.729]  This is not a drill.
[01:29:31.989 --> 01:29:34.691]  They're showing you there's only one party.
[01:29:34.911 --> 01:29:36.592]  Are there some good Republicans, low level?
[01:29:38.548 --> 01:29:40.330]  The Tea Party types who won't compromise?
[01:29:40.370 --> 01:29:40.670]  Yeah.
[01:29:40.931 --> 01:29:48.558]  And the system knows they're about to fully take over, so the Republican leadership's going, wait a minute, to be conservative means you turn your guns in.
[01:29:50.740 --> 01:29:51.621]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.142 --> 01:29:53.723]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.664 --> 01:29:57.327]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:06.778 --> 01:31:08.979]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[01:31:09.199 --> 01:31:18.124]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure and it's available discounted at infowars.com.
[01:31:18.284 --> 01:31:21.466]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[01:31:21.746 --> 01:31:23.167]  There's no priming required.
[01:31:23.427 --> 01:31:25.448]  It's NSF 42 certified.
[01:31:25.688 --> 01:31:27.329]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce
[01:31:27.489 --> 01:31:27.909]  We're good.
[01:31:56.343 --> 01:31:58.966]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[01:31:59.967 --> 01:32:02.409]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:02.429 --> 01:32:07.794]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:32:08.034 --> 01:32:12.658]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:32:13.039 --> 01:32:18.084]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:32:18.604 --> 01:32:23.307]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:32:23.828 --> 01:32:25.749]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:32:26.149 --> 01:32:30.752]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:32:30.952 --> 01:32:31.853]  And here's the best part.
[01:32:32.073 --> 01:32:34.835]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:32:35.135 --> 01:32:38.437]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:32:38.757 --> 01:32:41.599]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:32:41.940 --> 01:32:43.841]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:32:44.181 --> 01:32:45.102]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:32:48.724 --> 01:32:52.429]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:32:52.969 --> 01:32:57.475]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:32:57.795 --> 01:33:00.178]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:33:03.719 --> 01:33:12.446]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[01:33:13.226 --> 01:33:14.267]  Thomas Jefferson.
[01:33:14.807 --> 01:33:18.570]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:24.915 --> 01:33:28.578]  So they're saying, hey, should the American people be able to have anything the military has?
[01:33:29.910 --> 01:33:32.811]  And this is about keeping and bearing arms.
[01:33:32.871 --> 01:33:36.633]  It means firearms, knives, things you can carry.
[01:33:37.493 --> 01:33:45.556]  But the military is coming out with all these incredibly high-tech weapons that our tax money paid for, and now deploying this stuff against us.
[01:33:45.576 --> 01:33:49.198]  So the discussion should be, why do we have the military deploying against us?
[01:33:49.538 --> 01:33:52.519]  Why is Department of Defense satellites being used to spy on farmers?
[01:33:52.979 --> 01:33:59.142]  Why are you taking our tax money to militarize us as your new growth market in no-bid contracts?
[01:34:00.714 --> 01:34:02.095]  That's the big issue here.
[01:34:02.435 --> 01:34:08.620]  Not, oh my gosh, the American people are getting 100 round barrels and trying to scare people.
[01:34:09.180 --> 01:34:15.345]  By the way, I've used a lot of these barrels, and if you load them just right, they still end up jamming at around 70 or so.
[01:34:15.365 --> 01:34:16.206]  Okay, I mean, it is legendary.
[01:34:16.266 --> 01:34:18.527]  It is completely legendary.
[01:34:30.293 --> 01:34:32.454]  But that isn't even what this is about.
[01:34:33.395 --> 01:34:41.238]  There were mass shootings in the 1870s and stuff where 34 people got killed, where the person was using single shot.
[01:34:42.539 --> 01:34:43.800]  That isn't what this is about.
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:48.162]  You could sit there with clips, 10 round mags, jamming them in over and over again, killing people.
[01:34:48.902 --> 01:34:52.484]  It's about saying, let's ban everything with 10 mags and over and things that can take
[01:34:53.666 --> 01:34:54.106]  We're good to go.
[01:35:15.367 --> 01:35:18.468]  They got Michael Savage out going, no, it's time to ban semi-autos.
[01:35:18.688 --> 01:35:19.488]  Michael Savage.
[01:35:19.528 --> 01:35:21.948]  I've got the clip up at Infowars.com right now.
[01:35:22.489 --> 01:35:25.189]  Why are Republicans calling to disarm the American people?
[01:35:27.010 --> 01:35:29.610]  While the federal government is arming itself with the teeth against conservatives.
[01:35:29.870 --> 01:35:35.031]  This is such an important issue because let me tell you, I want the nightmare to be over.
[01:35:35.171 --> 01:35:42.253]  I want Obama to leave and I wish Mitt Romney was a good guy, but folks, the same people are financing Mitt Romney.
[01:35:43.547 --> 01:35:46.568]  The same people are financing him because they've got an agenda.
[01:35:46.988 --> 01:35:52.350]  And people like Scalia and others, I mean, you notice they had one of the Republicans vote for the healthcare.
[01:35:53.810 --> 01:35:59.432]  When it comes down to it, they're going to do what they're told, and they're being told to go after those guns.
[01:36:00.552 --> 01:36:05.794]  News Corp, on their non-news stuff, promotes anti-family carbon taxes, all this stuff.
[01:36:07.274 --> 01:36:09.495]  Rupert Murdoch's always been anti-gun, folks.
[01:36:11.650 --> 01:36:14.034]  They want to control the conservative market.
[01:36:14.074 --> 01:36:15.417]  That's all this has ever been.
[01:36:20.302 --> 01:36:21.042]  We're in a lot of trouble.
[01:36:21.222 --> 01:36:22.983]  Okay, let's go to Scalia.
[01:36:23.003 --> 01:36:24.303]  Just listen to him.
[01:36:24.343 --> 01:36:27.224]  Now, he's not like Crystal and all others saying just outright ban them.
[01:36:27.724 --> 01:36:34.225]  But he's a Supreme Court Justice on a news show saying, now get ready, folks, because, you know, we're allowed to restrict it.
[01:36:34.745 --> 01:36:35.965]  Can't have a rocket launcher.
[01:36:36.125 --> 01:36:37.746]  There's already laws on that and you know it.
[01:36:37.906 --> 01:36:39.546]  They're having straw man debates.
[01:36:39.986 --> 01:36:42.567]  And then he lies and says you can't have something that's scary.
[01:36:43.618 --> 01:36:47.404]  And what he talked about is a famous case about a guy threatening people with a battle axe.
[01:36:47.624 --> 01:36:54.775]  You can't go out with a sword, a machete, with a knife, with a gun, and brandish it on the street.
[01:36:54.975 --> 01:36:55.996]  You can have it on your side.
[01:36:58.407 --> 01:37:00.648]  But you cannot brandish it at people.
[01:37:00.688 --> 01:37:06.652]  Just like cops aren't supposed to pull their gun out for no reason or sign the ticket and put their hand on their gun.
[01:37:07.112 --> 01:37:09.513]  Police have gotten in trouble for that and courts have rolled against them.
[01:37:10.114 --> 01:37:13.656]  Because that's, in the threat continuum, that's a preparation to use deadly force.
[01:37:14.396 --> 01:37:16.577]  You're not supposed to do that, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:17.097 --> 01:37:19.819]  By the way, if you point a gun at somebody, you better be ready to kill them.
[01:37:22.100 --> 01:37:24.922]  In my world, if I point a gun at you, I'm going to shoot you.
[01:37:26.946 --> 01:37:33.028]  If I look at somebody breaking into my garage, I'm going to have a gun at my side, I'm going to say, you know, get out of my garage, because I don't want to kill somebody.
[01:37:33.048 --> 01:37:33.789]  I have to deal with the trouble.
[01:37:35.609 --> 01:37:38.991]  But if they were to start moving towards me, I'm not going to say a word.
[01:37:39.011 --> 01:37:40.611]  I'm going to shoot them right in the chest repeatedly.
[01:37:41.612 --> 01:37:43.973]  Now, you come in my house, you know, I'm not going to say anything to you.
[01:37:44.793 --> 01:37:51.996]  The first thing you're going to hear is white flashes and your eardrums ringing as you hit the ground as I pump rounds directly into your chest.
[01:37:54.977 --> 01:37:56.178]  People are like, ooh, that's radical.
[01:37:56.218 --> 01:37:56.718]  No, it's not.
[01:37:57.179 --> 01:37:58.700]  My ancestors were mean.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.182]  My ancestors didn't put up with people's garbage.
[01:38:01.362 --> 01:38:01.802]  And you know what?
[01:38:01.842 --> 01:38:02.503]  I got freedom.
[01:38:03.203 --> 01:38:07.287]  My family's got land because they fought for it.
[01:38:09.128 --> 01:38:21.378]  I am successful because my genetics and my background are from aggressive people that aren't going to get pushed around, but also moral people who know how to shake hands on a deal and do what you say you're going to do and deliver.
[01:38:23.257 --> 01:38:24.639]  It's called Americana.
[01:38:24.839 --> 01:38:26.361]  It's called what made this country great.
[01:38:26.421 --> 01:38:27.002]  And you know what?
[01:38:27.342 --> 01:38:30.366]  Regardless of what background you come from, you've got ancestors like that.
[01:38:30.606 --> 01:38:36.313]  So how about we uphold our family names and live up to something good instead of letting a bunch of globalists run over us?
[01:38:38.902 --> 01:38:42.764]  Let's go to this clip and then I'll go to your phone calls and then I'm going to give you financial news.
[01:38:43.144 --> 01:38:48.026]  Let's go ahead and here is Scalia saying, well, you can't have something that's scary.
[01:38:48.106 --> 01:38:48.646]  Wow, what?
[01:38:48.726 --> 01:38:53.768]  I mean, folks, do you know that the Supreme Court justice is saying you can't have something that's scary?
[01:38:56.729 --> 01:38:59.871]  Well, I mean, a butcher knife isn't scary when my wife's cutting carrots with it.
[01:38:59.891 --> 01:39:05.193]  But let me tell you, I pull it out and threaten to jab it in your heart or slit your throat with it.
[01:39:05.233 --> 01:39:06.113]  It's super scary.
[01:39:06.433 --> 01:39:07.294]  Well, see, that's the difference.
[01:39:08.206 --> 01:39:10.548]  You can't menace somebody for no reason with something.
[01:39:10.649 --> 01:39:11.549]  That's what's illegal!
[01:39:11.850 --> 01:39:13.151]  Not the Battle Axe, Scalia!
[01:39:13.451 --> 01:39:17.155]  And you know that well, Scalia!
[01:39:17.676 --> 01:39:20.178]  And boy, he looks like he was at the end of a plank or something.
[01:39:20.218 --> 01:39:22.440]  Like, somebody had a gun to his back when he's saying this.
[01:39:22.721 --> 01:39:24.703]  I mean, he knows he's committing suicide with his supporters.
[01:39:25.343 --> 01:39:25.764]  Politically.
[01:39:27.366 --> 01:39:29.710]  Political suicide, and why are they walking the plank?
[01:39:29.970 --> 01:39:34.677]  Because let me tell you, they're bought and paid for, folks, and the bankers are circling the wagons.
[01:39:34.898 --> 01:39:41.067]  They're imploding the world, they're bringing in world government, they're engineering a collapse, and they're not going to have anybody stand in the way of that.
[01:39:42.076 --> 01:39:42.756]  Let's go to Scalia.
[01:39:42.776 --> 01:39:43.156]  Here it is.
[01:39:43.897 --> 01:39:49.598]  ...to an issue that is in the news right now with the massacre in Colorado, and that is gun control.
[01:39:50.719 --> 01:40:00.582]  You wrote in 2008 the opinion in District of Columbia v. Heller, the majority opinion that said the Second Amendment means what it says.
[01:40:00.702 --> 01:40:03.003]  People have a right to bear arms.
[01:40:03.583 --> 01:40:03.983]  Question.
[01:40:04.683 --> 01:40:07.404]  How far does that constitutional right go?
[01:40:07.444 --> 01:40:09.265]  Can a legislature ban
[01:40:10.097 --> 01:40:19.604]  Semi-automatic weapons, or can it ban magazines that carry a hundred rounds without violating an individual's constitutional right to bear arms?
[01:40:20.877 --> 01:40:27.321]  What the opinion in Heller said is that it will have to be decided in future cases.
[01:40:27.982 --> 01:40:31.884]  What limitations upon the right to keep and bear arms are permissible?
[01:40:32.424 --> 01:40:37.167]  Some undoubtedly are, because there were some that were acknowledged at the time.
[01:40:37.648 --> 01:40:41.250]  For example, there was a tort called affrighting.
[01:40:42.331 --> 01:40:51.099]  Which, if you carried around a really horrible weapon just to scare people like a head axe or something, that was, I believe, a misdemeanor.
[01:40:51.539 --> 01:40:55.643]  So, yes, there are some limitations that can be imposed.
[01:40:56.424 --> 01:41:01.328]  What they are will depend on what the society understood were reasonable limitations at the time.
[01:41:01.348 --> 01:41:02.930]  There were certain location limitations.
[01:41:04.530 --> 01:41:06.611]  What about these technological limitations?
[01:41:06.731 --> 01:41:09.252]  Obviously we're not talking about a handgun or a musket.
[01:41:09.592 --> 01:41:13.493]  We're talking about a weapon that can fire a hundred shots in a minute.
[01:41:16.474 --> 01:41:17.394]  We'll see.
[01:41:18.094 --> 01:41:24.596]  I mean, obviously the amendment does not apply to
[01:41:26.137 --> 01:41:28.300]  Uh, arms that cannot be hand-carried.
[01:41:28.380 --> 01:41:31.043]  It's to keep and bear, so it doesn't apply to cannons.
[01:41:31.563 --> 01:41:39.651]  But I suppose there are hand-held rocket launchers that can bring down airplanes that will, will have to be, uh, uh, it'll have to be decided.
[01:41:39.671 --> 01:41:41.193]  So how do you decide that if you're a textualist?
[01:41:41.233 --> 01:41:42.134]  Very carefully.
[01:41:44.236 --> 01:41:47.760]  My, my, my starting point and probably my ending point will be
[01:41:49.214 --> 01:41:54.979]  What limitations are within the understood limitations that the society had at the time.
[01:41:55.439 --> 01:41:58.882]  They had some limitations on the nature of arms that could be born.
[01:41:59.563 --> 01:42:03.826]  So we'll see what those limitations are.
[01:42:03.846 --> 01:42:04.827]  That is not true.
[01:42:04.847 --> 01:42:09.011]  And there were not location controls, they had their guns in church, total lie.
[01:42:10.212 --> 01:42:14.516]  And no one can have a grenade launcher, a rocket launcher,
[01:42:16.636 --> 01:42:20.218]  You can buy them for movies and stuff and shoot a toy rocket out of them, but you can't get the warheads.
[01:42:20.258 --> 01:42:22.200]  That's just absolutely locked up in armories.
[01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:23.180]  They know that.
[01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:26.362]  But he says it'll have to be adjudicated because you can have a rocket launcher.
[01:42:27.783 --> 01:42:35.668]  Now, that compared to Savage and all of them just saying ban all semi-autos, Michael Savage has now become Michael Moore.
[01:42:36.329 --> 01:42:38.530]  And a lot of people are like, hey, I'll turn my gun in if he says do it.
[01:42:38.630 --> 01:42:39.411]  Okay, well, listen.
[01:42:39.711 --> 01:42:42.893]  You want to listen to an old beatnik who figured out there was a conservative market and took it over?
[01:42:43.273 --> 01:42:44.054]  Knock yourselves out.
[01:42:45.077 --> 01:42:50.100]  You know, I'm not trying to get into a, uh, you know, big frackish.
[01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:53.601]  The point is, the article's up there if you can face the reality of how much trouble we're in.
[01:42:54.102 --> 01:42:56.343]  Uh, Frank in North Carolina, then Ghost Recon in Oregon.
[01:42:56.623 --> 01:42:57.924]  Frank, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:42:57.964 --> 01:43:02.666]  What do you, what do you make of, um, all these big Republicans coming out and saying the same thing?
[01:43:03.126 --> 01:43:04.447]  Ban semi-autos.
[01:43:05.768 --> 01:43:08.809]  Well, actually, I was calling to talk about Scalia, but you've already covered that.
[01:43:09.150 --> 01:43:09.850]  It doesn't surprise me.
[01:43:09.890 --> 01:43:10.230]  No, go ahead.
[01:43:10.470 --> 01:43:10.930]  Yeah, it doesn't.
[01:43:10.970 --> 01:43:11.911]  No, no, you've already covered it.
[01:43:12.347 --> 01:43:13.648]  It doesn't surprise me at all.
[01:43:13.788 --> 01:43:22.254]  I just wasn't sure if you were aware of him on the, I'm not even sure what show that was, but yeah, I heard some of that earlier today.
[01:43:22.274 --> 01:43:26.016]  But are you aware that, have you talked to Colonel Six lately?
[01:43:26.796 --> 01:43:28.237]  No, I don't think he's gotten through.
[01:43:28.297 --> 01:43:28.538]  Why?
[01:43:29.238 --> 01:43:36.523]  Well, I'm not sure if it's true or not, but I understand that he's an African American Marine Colonel.
[01:43:37.428 --> 01:43:38.148]  Uh, pretty big.
[01:43:38.228 --> 01:43:43.491]  I think he led some tank brigade into Baghdad or something like that during the first Gulf War.
[01:43:44.271 --> 01:43:48.993]  Well, I hope I'm not incorrect on this, but I understand that he is dead.
[01:43:50.274 --> 01:43:57.217]  He supposedly was an outspoken critic of Obama, and I understand he committed suicide recently.
[01:43:58.174 --> 01:43:59.134]  You're joking.
[01:43:59.194 --> 01:44:00.515]  Folks, look that up right now.
[01:44:00.535 --> 01:44:02.615]  I mean, I knew that he was who he said in the Marines.
[01:44:02.655 --> 01:44:03.876]  I didn't know about that particular.
[01:44:04.256 --> 01:44:09.857]  And I know he said that top general was going to be brought down.
[01:44:09.877 --> 01:44:13.278]  Who was the one that got removed in Afghanistan?
[01:44:13.298 --> 01:44:14.438]  The name will pop in my head in a minute.
[01:44:15.739 --> 01:44:17.139]  He said that was going to happen months before.
[01:44:17.199 --> 01:44:18.419]  He did give us a lot of good stuff.
[01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:20.180]  You're saying he got Arkansas-ed?
[01:44:21.070 --> 01:44:21.570]  I don't know.
[01:44:22.511 --> 01:44:26.433]  I heard this on some shortwave show about a week or so ago.
[01:44:26.833 --> 01:44:28.154]  He is apparently dead.
[01:44:28.174 --> 01:44:30.576]  It sounded like a very credible report.
[01:44:31.156 --> 01:44:32.377]  Alright, I'll look into it.
[01:44:32.417 --> 01:44:33.057]  I'll look into it.
[01:44:34.318 --> 01:44:36.619]  Listen, if I end up committing suicide, folks, that's a lie.
[01:44:37.140 --> 01:44:40.882]  In fact, I've got my living will filed here with local lawyers.
[01:44:41.862 --> 01:44:49.407]  I have handwritten that I want full everything and then I added Darth Vader level life support.
[01:44:50.328 --> 01:44:52.230]  Yeah, I want the whole nine yards.
[01:44:52.330 --> 01:44:53.151]  I want everything.
[01:44:53.572 --> 01:44:55.013]  I will never commit suicide.
[01:44:55.274 --> 01:44:57.876]  Ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.
[01:44:58.717 --> 01:45:00.319]  Just get that straight.
[01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:02.281]  Oh my gosh.
[01:45:02.361 --> 01:45:04.884]  Well, I hope that's not the case, sir.
[01:45:05.525 --> 01:45:06.966]  I hope that that was a rumor or something.
[01:45:07.247 --> 01:45:09.729]  Wow, do you have anything else you'd like to add?
[01:45:10.250 --> 01:45:12.072]  Did you ever see the movie Shooter?
[01:45:13.001 --> 01:45:16.544]  Yes, Mark Wahlberg, very good movie, very, very accurate.
[01:45:16.584 --> 01:45:24.850]  Marine Scout Sniper gets set up and it shows in meticulous detail how they go about setting someone up to become a shooter and a patsy.
[01:45:24.910 --> 01:45:31.496]  No, no, they hire you to be part of a drill, just like 7-7 it came out, and then they blow you up, yeah.
[01:45:31.736 --> 01:45:32.777]  Very accurate, you're right.
[01:45:33.377 --> 01:45:35.379]  I worked in a movie theater back in the early 80s.
[01:45:35.439 --> 01:45:43.507]  It was, at the time, it was a state-of-the-art theater, six-plex or whatnot, and I worked there for a couple years in high school.
[01:45:44.028 --> 01:45:48.011]  When those doors opened, those exit doors, trust me, we knew it.
[01:45:48.592 --> 01:45:56.800]  This was back in the early 80s, and we were required to run down there and run the kids off because there was, you know, we did the midnight movies, we did
[01:45:57.807 --> 01:46:03.172]  Yeah, and of course, and on the opening of a Batman, you're going to have people in that hallway back there where it opens up.
[01:46:03.192 --> 01:46:04.794]  You're going to have people in the theater.
[01:46:04.814 --> 01:46:06.556]  I mean, it's standard procedure.
[01:46:06.576 --> 01:46:08.097]  The whole thing's cockamamie, folks.
[01:46:08.458 --> 01:46:08.958]  God bless you.
[01:46:08.978 --> 01:46:09.979]  I appreciate your call.
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:12.622]  We'll look into what he said there.
[01:46:12.882 --> 01:46:15.144]  Ghost in Oregon.
[01:46:15.164 --> 01:46:15.725]  You're on the air.
[01:46:15.745 --> 01:46:16.145]  Go ahead.
[01:46:16.165 --> 01:46:18.047]  Hey, Alex.
[01:46:18.067 --> 01:46:18.548]  How's it going?
[01:46:18.588 --> 01:46:19.669]  It's great to talk to you.
[01:46:20.780 --> 01:46:21.841]  It's not going too good.
[01:46:21.881 --> 01:46:23.562]  I mean, our worst nightmares are coming true.
[01:46:24.363 --> 01:46:26.244]  They're going to move.
[01:46:26.264 --> 01:46:27.846]  They're going to move on the guns.
[01:46:29.367 --> 01:46:29.847]  I agree.
[01:46:30.267 --> 01:46:31.068]  I totally agree.
[01:46:31.408 --> 01:46:33.390]  I'm ex-military myself.
[01:46:34.090 --> 01:46:42.537]  I've been out since 98 and I woke up back then during the service and I got to tell you, I got to tell the listeners, Dave, you must listen to Alex.
[01:46:42.577 --> 01:46:43.898]  He knows what he's talking about.
[01:46:43.938 --> 01:46:44.999]  This is not a joke.
[01:46:45.599 --> 01:46:46.660]  It's not a game.
[01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:50.723]  These people are serious, and they really want to come for your guns.
[01:46:50.783 --> 01:46:54.785]  And when they do it, they're not going to knock on your door, and they're not going to be cool about it.
[01:46:54.845 --> 01:46:57.707]  They're just going to come in, and they're going to take what they want.
[01:46:58.087 --> 01:47:02.170]  And they're going to put a bullet in anything that stops or tries to stop them.
[01:47:02.651 --> 01:47:04.612]  And people need to wake up to this.
[01:47:05.172 --> 01:47:08.875]  I don't understand why so many people are arguing about the Constitution.
[01:47:09.235 --> 01:47:10.476]  It blatantly states.
[01:47:11.796 --> 01:47:21.240]  From the government, at a time... This is when the Second Amendment was meant to be.
[01:47:21.260 --> 01:47:22.340]  I mean, this is it.
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:26.382]  We've been taken over by foreign banks that brag they've done it.
[01:47:26.402 --> 01:47:28.002]  I mean, how arrogant is this?
[01:47:28.462 --> 01:47:31.784]  We've got a homeland security system there to absorb the old republic.
[01:47:32.164 --> 01:47:34.605]  It's all run by pedophiles and criminals publicly.
[01:47:35.225 --> 01:47:37.706]  And it's a joke what we put up with.
[01:47:38.286 --> 01:47:44.455]  And they plan to march the military and police up against the American people and it's going to be a giant civil war.
[01:47:44.835 --> 01:47:46.538]  And that's the false flag.
[01:47:46.898 --> 01:47:48.460]  They want to start this.
[01:47:48.961 --> 01:47:50.663]  And I again tell the military and police...
[01:47:51.940 --> 01:47:53.942]  Do not be part of it.
[01:47:54.363 --> 01:47:56.285]  Do not be part of it.
[01:47:57.086 --> 01:47:58.748]  And don't just say you won't be part of it.
[01:47:59.008 --> 01:48:00.910]  You've got to speak out now, okay?
[01:48:01.391 --> 01:48:03.233]  That is the bare minimum, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48:03.533 --> 01:48:08.739]  You've got... Listen, just look at Napolitano, look at Obama, look at these globalists, look at Bill Kristol.
[01:48:08.939 --> 01:48:10.240]  They're a bunch of scum.
[01:48:10.540 --> 01:48:11.701]  These are authoritarians.
[01:48:12.022 --> 01:48:13.503]  Bill Kristol thinks you're so dumb.
[01:48:13.883 --> 01:48:25.713]  He wrote an article with Dick Cheney saying we need a big terror attack that'll kill 3,000 people like Pearl Harbor, and we need race-specific weapons to kill certain people and have the media agree with it, and we're gonna launch a big takeover and have a police state in America.
[01:48:26.534 --> 01:48:29.397]  September 20, 2000, Rebuilding America's Defense is PNAC.
[01:48:29.878 --> 01:48:33.441]  Rand Corporation writes all this because they know the public doesn't read it.
[01:48:34.162 --> 01:48:35.463]  How do I know it's going to happen?
[01:48:35.684 --> 01:48:37.385]  Because they've told us what they're going to do.
[01:48:37.666 --> 01:48:39.047]  That's how dumb they think we are.
[01:48:39.187 --> 01:48:42.571]  They're operating open in front of us.
[01:48:43.091 --> 01:48:44.373]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:48:44.833 --> 01:48:45.394]  Anything else, sir?
[01:48:46.485 --> 01:48:47.586]  Meanwhile, Harvard admits...
[01:49:15.014 --> 01:49:21.458]  With over a dozen studies that fluoride is eating our brain, and folks, they put it in all the different children's products.
[01:49:21.698 --> 01:49:23.480]  The kids are mentally retarded.
[01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:24.961]  They're murdering us.
[01:49:25.041 --> 01:49:26.542]  People are like, that's a little harsh.
[01:49:27.222 --> 01:49:28.303]  That's reality!
[01:49:28.543 --> 01:49:31.345]  We're run by total psychomad scientists.
[01:49:31.565 --> 01:49:34.067]  I don't know how else to get this across to people.
[01:49:35.127 --> 01:49:42.612]  I guarantee you, if I walked up to the average cop and slapped them in the face, they would beat my head in with the billy club and take me to jail.
[01:49:42.672 --> 01:49:43.173]  And they should.
[01:49:44.628 --> 01:49:51.638]  But people weaponize food and water, and not just police, the general public loves being assaulted.
[01:49:51.958 --> 01:49:57.406]  You know how sick it is to go to a grocery store and see all over everywhere?
[01:49:58.788 --> 01:49:59.809]  All over everywhere.
[01:50:00.871 --> 01:50:06.813]  Four kids, fluoride toothpaste, fluoride water, four babies, oh, you know, Pedialyte with Aspartame.
[01:50:07.094 --> 01:50:09.855]  I mean, they know what that's doing to people, folks.
[01:50:09.875 --> 01:50:11.395]  This is a sick joke.
[01:50:12.136 --> 01:50:13.516]  This is the sickest of jokes.
[01:50:13.536 --> 01:50:14.356]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:50:14.597 --> 01:50:18.518]  I'm going to come back and get some financial news, then we'll get to Tim, Aaron, Ken, and others.
[01:50:18.818 --> 01:50:22.900]  We're going to have popping in on the show, Larry Pratt, about the devastation we're facing.
[01:50:23.300 --> 01:50:24.761]  The head of Gunners of America.
[01:50:25.561 --> 01:50:27.742]  What this signifies, I know in all his years,
[01:50:28.862 --> 01:50:29.583]  I would imagine.
[01:50:29.843 --> 01:50:30.304]  I don't know.
[01:50:30.384 --> 01:50:37.209]  I'm going to ask him, has he ever seen most of the Republican leadership come out and say, well, you don't need semi-auto.
[01:50:37.229 --> 01:50:42.193]  I mean, this is like Bill Clinton has suddenly become, has possessed Michael Savage.
[01:50:43.254 --> 01:50:48.298]  I mean, we are in, because folks, they only uncloak like this when they're about to drop the hammer.
[01:50:48.558 --> 01:50:50.559]  They're getting ready for martial law in October.
[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:51.960]  I'm not saying that's coming.
[01:50:52.241 --> 01:50:53.402]  That's in the news.
[01:50:53.942 --> 01:50:58.884]  Where the DHS is preparing for civil unrest in the election collapse.
[01:51:01.479 --> 01:51:05.720]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:51:06.040 --> 01:51:06.640]  Number 1.
[01:51:06.940 --> 01:51:10.081]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:51:10.361 --> 01:51:10.901]  Number 2.
[01:51:11.221 --> 01:51:15.763]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:51:16.103 --> 01:51:16.543]  It's true.
[01:51:16.843 --> 01:51:21.384]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:51:21.704 --> 01:51:22.204]  Number 3.
[01:51:22.504 --> 01:51:25.785]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:51:26.085 --> 01:51:29.786]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:51:30.006 --> 01:51:30.566]  Number four.
[01:51:30.807 --> 01:51:33.168]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:51:33.548 --> 01:51:36.930]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:51:37.230 --> 01:51:37.751]  Number five.
[01:51:38.011 --> 01:51:41.933]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:51:42.173 --> 01:51:46.896]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:51:47.196 --> 01:51:51.219]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:51:51.359 --> 01:51:52.920]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:51:58.063 --> 01:51:58.283]  877-327-0365.
[01:51:58.323 --> 01:52:05.226]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:52:05.887 --> 01:52:08.028]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:52:08.928 --> 01:52:17.272]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:52:17.893 --> 01:52:22.795]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:52:23.428 --> 01:52:34.419]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[01:52:34.820 --> 01:52:41.827]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[01:52:42.487 --> 01:52:46.753]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[01:52:46.793 --> 01:52:49.977]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.

[01:52:57.667 --> 01:52:58.648]  Protect your immune system.

[01:53:00.450 --> 01:53:01.651]  We take a lot for granted.
[01:53:01.971 --> 01:53:04.093]  Lights, water, even food we eat.
[01:53:04.333 --> 01:53:05.715]  But what if these things went away?
[01:53:05.915 --> 01:53:09.098]  Would you know how to protect your family in a natural or man-made disaster?
[01:53:09.318 --> 01:53:10.459]  Would you know how to survive?
[01:53:10.779 --> 01:53:15.503]  When disaster hits, power and water are gone and the mobs go crazy grabbing food off the shelves.
[01:53:15.944 --> 01:53:18.486]  You and your family may be waiting in long lines for help.
[01:53:18.926 --> 01:53:19.767]  Don't be helpless.

[01:53:38.938 --> 01:53:42.200]  The government suggests we maintain an emergency supply of food and water.
[01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:47.522]  But do you know the 37 food items that will fly off grocery shelves or a simple way to treat unsafe drinking water?
[01:53:47.662 --> 01:53:49.063]  This information is critical.
[01:53:49.523 --> 01:53:52.064]  Find it now on 123survivalplan.com.
[01:53:52.384 --> 01:53:54.284]  Don't take your family's safety for granted.

[01:53:57.145 --> 01:53:59.365]  That's 123survivalplan.com.
[01:54:06.447 --> 01:54:10.187]  Yeah, Colonel Six had given me his real name and I looked up who he was.
[01:54:11.028 --> 01:54:16.789]  Unless the person on the other end of the phone who gave me a lot of good info was somebody impersonating an African-American
[01:54:19.645 --> 01:54:25.608]  Marine Corps Colonel, who had just gotten out of the service a few months before, he gave us a lot of info.
[01:54:25.629 --> 01:54:27.470]  His site has not been updated since June.
[01:54:27.490 --> 01:54:29.831]  I'm trying to dig up his real name.
[01:54:29.891 --> 01:54:31.112]  It's somewhere here in our notes.
[01:54:31.352 --> 01:54:32.292]  We called his cell phone.
[01:54:32.312 --> 01:54:33.173]  It's been disconnected.
[01:54:33.553 --> 01:54:34.354]  He'd been on as a guest.
[01:54:34.394 --> 01:54:35.954]  He gave us nothing but good information.
[01:54:37.615 --> 01:54:43.379]  He told us when certain generals were going to be gone, that scandals were coming up, all sorts of stuff.
[01:54:43.679 --> 01:54:48.762]  And if he did commit suicide, that's very suspicious.
[01:54:50.246 --> 01:54:53.789]  Now, for this segment and the next, and then Larry Pratt is going to be joining us.
[01:54:53.829 --> 01:54:54.930]  I'll continue with your calls.
[01:54:55.271 --> 01:54:56.372]  We're joined by Ted Anderson.
[01:54:56.392 --> 01:54:57.533]  He hasn't been on with us in months.
[01:54:58.173 --> 01:54:59.915]  Here's CNBC.com.
[01:54:59.975 --> 01:55:03.398]  Gold to hit $2,000 by year-end on more Fed easing.
[01:55:03.458 --> 01:55:06.620]  Merrill Lynch's top analysts are saying that's CNBC.
[01:55:07.121 --> 01:55:08.522]  Here's Financial Times of London.
[01:55:08.902 --> 01:55:11.485]  Big investors bet Fed will embark on QE3.
[01:55:11.505 --> 01:55:12.806]  Well, we thought that would happen last year.
[01:55:14.128 --> 01:55:16.550]  QE3 launch unlikely to make waves.
[01:55:16.570 --> 01:55:18.251]  That's another Financial Times of London.
[01:55:18.731 --> 01:55:23.454]  Gold hovers around $1,620 per ounce as they wait for central banks.
[01:55:23.474 --> 01:55:25.256]  Now remember when it was a lot when gold was $600 an ounce?
[01:55:25.276 --> 01:55:26.737]  It was a lot when it was $300.
[01:55:27.017 --> 01:55:28.137]  It was a lot when it was $1,000, $1,500, went up to $2,000.
[01:55:28.177 --> 01:55:29.738]  They've been artificially driving it down.
[01:55:33.835 --> 01:55:34.035]  I don't
[01:55:54.773 --> 01:56:05.586]  What's going on in the gold market right now and the manipulation and it looks like more of the rumblings leaning towards QE3 in the late fall early winter or what's your what's your intel say?
[01:56:06.516 --> 01:56:10.500]  Well that's what I'm seeing too, QE3, that's the big word right now out on the street.
[01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:12.782]  And I'm reading the same stuff that you are.
[01:56:12.882 --> 01:56:15.104]  The Economic Times is reporting the same thing.
[01:56:15.164 --> 01:56:21.931]  As a matter of fact, BriefWire is saying that gold hit over $2,000 an ounce this year and somewhere around $1,900 an ounce.
[01:56:22.031 --> 01:56:23.412]  We are sitting down at $1,620.90, but see the low at $1,550.
[01:56:31.540 --> 01:56:36.845]  One of the reasons why I haven't come up on the air with you is because of the fact that we had to find a bottom here.
[01:56:36.885 --> 01:56:43.632]  We had such a huge rush from that $600 figure all the way up to $1,900 an ounce.
[01:56:44.252 --> 01:56:46.975]  And then we had to see some kind of a correction.
[01:56:47.715 --> 01:56:50.098]  The banks were trying to pull things back together again.
[01:56:50.398 --> 01:56:51.059]  But you know, Alex,
[01:56:51.519 --> 01:56:52.920]  We have the Patriot Act.
[01:56:53.140 --> 01:56:54.080]  We have TARP.
[01:56:54.120 --> 01:56:57.021]  We've had bailouts for banks that were too big to fail.
[01:56:57.361 --> 01:56:58.201]  Real ID.
[01:56:58.982 --> 01:57:03.503]  Most of the politicians have little clue about the Fed and what hard money means.
[01:57:03.924 --> 01:57:05.824]  And now we're looking at the printing press again.
[01:57:06.184 --> 01:57:08.125]  Yeah, indeed, they're calling for QE3.
[01:57:08.465 --> 01:57:11.926]  Banks like Goldman Sachs, HSBC's in trouble.
[01:57:12.267 --> 01:57:12.927]  I mean, it's just...
[01:57:14.244 --> 01:57:18.265]  Everything is kind of falling apart here at the end of the year, and it's not surprising.
[01:57:18.605 --> 01:57:20.685]  July, this is the last day of July.
[01:57:21.086 --> 01:57:22.706]  This is the second to last day of July.
[01:57:23.006 --> 01:57:24.146]  We're coming into August.
[01:57:24.706 --> 01:57:37.269]  Things move in the fall in gold, with the exception of when George Bush was leaving office in 2008 and telling everybody that there's going to be martial law if we don't have TARP passed.
[01:57:37.789 --> 01:57:40.530]  And that forced us into what I would call QE1.
[01:57:41.690 --> 01:57:45.333]  And then it just kept on building up from there.
[01:57:45.353 --> 01:57:48.796]  Oil prices and gold and silver and everything shoot up in price.
[01:57:49.156 --> 01:57:53.079]  Right now silver's at $28.17, up $0.28 here today.
[01:57:53.099 --> 01:57:55.300]  It's been down as low as $0.26.
[01:57:56.742 --> 01:57:59.404]  $1,550 gold, now we're at $1,621.90.
[01:57:59.924 --> 01:58:09.992]  The economy has fallen apart and the politicians still think the best answer for economic problems is to resort back to the printing press.
[01:58:10.532 --> 01:58:14.974]  This is why we need hard currency, because the politicians, they wouldn't even have that option.
[01:58:15.254 --> 01:58:16.135]  But we don't have it.
[01:58:16.575 --> 01:58:18.656]  And the Fed is talking about QE3.
[01:58:19.016 --> 01:58:23.539]  They're doing everything they can to say that it's not going to happen, but they know it has to happen.
[01:58:23.719 --> 01:58:25.820]  We have way too much debt in this country.
[01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:27.601]  We are loaded up to the gills.
[01:58:27.961 --> 01:58:29.922]  The economy can't afford to support it.
[01:58:30.302 --> 01:58:33.984]  And the only answer to them is to... You're right, kid!
[01:58:34.124 --> 01:58:36.105]  ...and push more money out into the system.
[01:58:41.943 --> 01:58:43.826]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.469 --> 01:58:47.753]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.405 --> 01:58:54.488]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.
[01:58:54.868 --> 01:59:00.613]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[01:59:00.813 --> 01:59:07.218]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[01:59:07.418 --> 01:59:12.823]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[01:59:13.103 --> 01:59:16.746]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[01:59:16.906 --> 01:59:20.489]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[01:59:20.729 --> 01:59:25.113]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.
[01:59:25.333 --> 01:59:27.655]  You'll also find it at infowarshop.com.
[01:59:27.815 --> 01:59:31.379]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[01:59:31.679 --> 01:59:35.962]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21, by Rosa Corey.
[01:59:36.123 --> 01:59:38.765]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[01:59:39.065 --> 01:59:45.593]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[01:59:45.893 --> 01:59:50.618]  These titles and a lot more are all available at InfoWarshop.com.
[01:59:54.363 --> 01:59:56.265]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.765 --> 01:59:59.528]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:06.072 --> 02:00:10.234]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.895 --> 02:00:11.695]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.495 --> 02:00:13.376]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.036 --> 02:00:17.718]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.219 --> 02:00:22.281]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.562 --> 02:00:29.586]  All right, Larry Pratt is coming up to break down what I see as the biggest concerted assault in the Second Amendment ever.
[02:00:30.006 --> 02:00:34.990]  Bipartisan, by globalist front men posing as Democrats and Republicans.
[02:00:35.450 --> 02:00:40.934]  Ted Anderson, I wanted to get him on earlier in the article, but I got behind earlier in the broadcast.
[02:00:42.114 --> 02:00:48.579]  But continuing with these articles I was mentioning, you know, Merrill Lynch is saying $2,000 goal by the end of the year.
[02:00:49.639 --> 02:00:53.122]  I don't know if that's going to be the case, but Ted, my point is,
[02:00:54.542 --> 02:00:59.325]  I believe, for myself personally, now is a good time to get into gold and silver.
[02:00:59.465 --> 02:01:06.368]  And in my experience, working with you for almost 15 years, you were a sponsor 15 years ago, you started Genesis, what, 14 years ago or more.
[02:01:07.088 --> 02:01:10.369]  You've got the best deals on gold, bullion, silver, you name it.
[02:01:10.389 --> 02:01:13.551]  But you also have the numismatics and collectibles, really good deals on that.
[02:01:14.031 --> 02:01:24.078]  You have a special offer you're still running, but it ends in just a couple weeks because we're going to be out of the book, Big Brother and the American Dream.
[02:01:24.778 --> 02:01:30.542]  You get two silver dollars and a great book and a powerful film about the Banksters for $63.
[02:01:32.563 --> 02:01:38.005]  And I can tell you right now Ted's losing money on that deal but it's a promotional offer.
[02:01:38.025 --> 02:01:38.685]  What do they call that?
[02:01:38.705 --> 02:01:39.345]  A loss leader.
[02:01:39.365 --> 02:01:45.867]  So you can click on the banner at the top of Infowars.com on the right hand side or give Midas Resources a call at 800-686-2237.
[02:01:45.887 --> 02:01:45.927]  800-686-2237.
[02:01:45.947 --> 02:01:46.087]  But Ted,
[02:01:54.430 --> 02:01:59.014]  What are some of the other specials that Midas Resources is running?
[02:01:59.334 --> 02:02:04.017]  Because, I mean, the smart money, at least in my mind, is on that it's going to go up quite a bit in the fall.
[02:02:04.478 --> 02:02:05.479]  Now is a great time.
[02:02:05.519 --> 02:02:08.321]  It looks like this is, well, it's hit its bottom, gone up a little bit.
[02:02:08.941 --> 02:02:10.863]  And I think now is a good time to get into gold and silver.
[02:02:11.795 --> 02:02:12.395]  It sure is.
[02:02:12.575 --> 02:02:16.696]  I mean, one of the great buys that I have right now are the Walking Liberty Halves at $16.83.
[02:02:17.216 --> 02:02:20.217]  Those were at $16 a piece here just six months ago.
[02:02:21.097 --> 02:02:25.318]  That book and silver dollar offer, $63 for two silver dollars.
[02:02:25.358 --> 02:02:28.258]  I mean, you've got to remember, silver's at $28.17.
[02:02:28.998 --> 02:02:34.039]  There's nobody on the planet that is offering two silver dollars and a $10 book and a $10 video for $63.
[02:02:37.180 --> 02:02:39.040]  Yeah, that book retails for $19.
[02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:46.962]  A little bit of silver at a low flat price and that way you can get educated and involved in the gold and silver market.
[02:02:47.242 --> 02:02:53.623]  $20 Liberties, you had Lindsey Williams on and he's talking about gold confiscation.
[02:02:53.663 --> 02:02:57.004]  If you want to stay away from that, the $20 Liberties makes sense right now.
[02:02:57.364 --> 02:02:57.624]  They're at $19.89.
[02:02:57.684 --> 02:02:58.204]  There's just a long
[02:03:00.985 --> 02:03:08.370]  A bunch of gold and silver bullion and numismatic or semi-numismatic tech coins that you can be getting into at this time.
[02:03:08.890 --> 02:03:11.132]  And the prices are summer prices.
[02:03:11.192 --> 02:03:15.454]  Rather than waiting until October when everything is hitting the fan, do it now.
[02:03:15.775 --> 02:03:18.476]  Because now is the time to get in while the prices are low.
[02:03:18.797 --> 02:03:20.478]  You're at $1621.90.
[02:03:20.798 --> 02:03:26.482]  Gold has already gone up $60 to $70 an ounce just within the last two or three weeks.
[02:03:27.222 --> 02:03:34.227]  You know, that's the QE2, the QE3 thing that's coming up that all the market is nervous about, and it's reality.
[02:03:35.327 --> 02:03:40.591]  With the unemployment, everything going like it is, you know, we're going to have more stimulus.
[02:03:40.951 --> 02:03:49.917]  All right, Ted's joining us via Skype, and I want to do a whole interview with you in the next few weeks to really break down a forecast, maybe get some other forecasters on.
[02:03:50.257 --> 02:03:53.039]  I haven't even had you on since Bob Chapman passed.
[02:03:53.540 --> 02:03:56.662]  You want to say any comments about Bob Chapman, who used to join us every Friday?
[02:03:57.202 --> 02:04:02.863]  Yeah, Bob Chapman was a great friend and really had a good grip on what was going on economically.
[02:04:03.563 --> 02:04:06.324]  Bob Chapman convinced people to get out of the real estate market.
[02:04:06.344 --> 02:04:08.405]  I don't think there was anybody else calling for that.
[02:04:08.745 --> 02:04:11.385]  And that market just took a huge tank.
[02:04:11.425 --> 02:04:16.787]  Getting out of the stock market and so on and so forth, putting people into gold and silver at $300 to $600 an ounce.
[02:04:17.487 --> 02:04:20.147]  And just a good, straightforward, honest man.
[02:04:20.207 --> 02:04:22.648]  It's just a shame to have lost him, that's for sure.
[02:04:23.268 --> 02:04:26.330]  But he is out of the reach of the globalists now with his Heavenly Father.
[02:04:26.350 --> 02:04:30.713]  All right, 800-686-2237.
[02:04:31.193 --> 02:04:36.877]  Ted Anderson, Midas Resources, the name, the trusted name in precious metals, who I use, who I work with.
[02:04:36.917 --> 02:04:38.739]  We get offers every day for other sponsors.
[02:04:39.139 --> 02:04:43.462]  Beating down our door, some of them I'm sure are great, but we only work with Ted Anderson.
[02:04:43.982 --> 02:04:46.083]  Some good local places in different areas of the country as well.
[02:04:46.463 --> 02:04:47.563]  Nationally, 800-686-2237.
[02:04:47.643 --> 02:04:53.065]  Or at Infowars.com, click on the banner there at the right-hand corner.
[02:04:53.545 --> 02:04:56.186]  Two silver dollars, a book, and a powerful video.
[02:04:56.606 --> 02:04:57.526]  Sixty-three dollars.
[02:04:57.886 --> 02:04:59.427]  Ted's losing about twenty bucks on that.
[02:05:02.506 --> 02:05:16.962]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:05:17.983 --> 02:05:21.647]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:22.665 --> 02:05:34.657]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:05:35.417 --> 02:05:42.704]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:05:43.385 --> 02:05:52.971]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:05:53.751 --> 02:05:57.013]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[02:05:57.674 --> 02:06:00.796]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[02:06:01.616 --> 02:06:02.617]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:06:02.857 --> 02:06:04.018]  What does freedom mean to you?
[02:06:04.358 --> 02:06:05.178]  The freedom to choose?
[02:06:05.258 --> 02:06:05.979]  The freedom to vote?
[02:06:06.219 --> 02:06:06.960]  The freedom to worship?
[02:06:07.220 --> 02:06:09.181]  How about the freedom to take control of your own future?
[02:06:09.421 --> 02:06:14.584]  My friends at eFoods Direct are celebrating freedom this month while helping you take control of your greatest dependency, food.

[02:07:01.121 --> 02:07:06.387]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[02:07:06.667 --> 02:07:08.869]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[02:07:09.049 --> 02:07:10.631]  My friends, I've done a lot of research.
[02:07:10.871 --> 02:07:14.556]  And the best gravity filter out there, bar none, is ProPure.
[02:07:14.756 --> 02:07:17.980]  And it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[02:07:18.140 --> 02:07:21.324]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[02:07:21.584 --> 02:07:23.026]  There's no priming required.
[02:07:23.286 --> 02:07:25.329]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[02:07:25.549 --> 02:07:28.032]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[02:07:29.113 --> 02:07:30.454]  Easy to set up and use.
[02:07:30.634 --> 02:07:31.934]  Doesn't require electricity.
[02:07:32.054 --> 02:07:34.916]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[02:07:35.216 --> 02:07:38.397]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[02:07:38.597 --> 02:07:40.398]  Save money by not buying bottled water.
[02:07:40.498 --> 02:07:42.579]  And avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[02:07:42.739 --> 02:07:45.340]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[02:07:45.481 --> 02:07:46.781]  It's what my family uses.
[02:07:47.061 --> 02:07:50.283]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[02:07:50.363 --> 02:07:55.685]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[02:07:55.725 --> 02:07:57.366]  You can also call to order.
[02:07:57.526 --> 02:07:58.327]  We're good to go.
[02:08:19.008 --> 02:08:21.410]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[02:08:21.490 --> 02:08:36.102]  Larry Pratt, who came on the InfoWars Nightly News last Friday and agreed that if the criminal elements of the government would stage Fast and Furious that killed hundreds conservatively, thousands probably, that they would stage the theater event.
[02:08:36.142 --> 02:08:38.664]  And boy, that story just gets crazier and crazier.
[02:08:39.165 --> 02:08:39.986]  But I wanted to get
[02:08:41.078 --> 02:08:47.364]  Larry Pratt on to discuss this latest news article that has come out.
[02:08:48.245 --> 02:08:53.030]  Time Magazine, How Guns Won, Why Americans Have Turned Against Gun Control.
[02:08:54.557 --> 02:08:58.559]  And yes, the polls show that we are politically winning.
[02:08:58.679 --> 02:08:59.720]  And we do have Larry Pratt.
[02:08:59.880 --> 02:09:01.140]  He's on with us via Skype.
[02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:03.642]  We're just trying to get audio right now.
[02:09:03.942 --> 02:09:05.683]  In about two minutes, just go to telephone.
[02:09:06.103 --> 02:09:09.705]  Like I said, we'll end it here and just go to phone.
[02:09:10.425 --> 02:09:14.928]  I'd rather just get Larry on than just have 20 people work on it and it never happened.
[02:09:15.928 --> 02:09:18.769]  So this is a big issue here.
[02:09:19.510 --> 02:09:23.432]  Because now you've got the major Republican leadership
[02:09:25.274 --> 02:09:25.955]  I think so.
[02:09:40.831 --> 02:09:43.493]  And every time there's a mass shooting, people want more guns.
[02:09:43.853 --> 02:09:44.553]  Because they get it.
[02:09:44.613 --> 02:09:46.255]  The government can't and won't protect you.
[02:09:46.275 --> 02:09:47.916]  They can come confiscate your gun like Katrina.
[02:09:48.636 --> 02:09:55.901]  And so the system is really showing us that they're in a very, very serious panic mode right now.
[02:09:57.422 --> 02:09:59.663]  And this is a big deal because they're very dangerous.
[02:10:00.544 --> 02:10:06.748]  Also, it's not getting any attention at any level
[02:10:09.178 --> 02:10:13.459]  That they have introduced a rider on a bill that I checked the progress of.
[02:10:13.499 --> 02:10:14.500]  It's getting co-sponsors.
[02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:17.301]  They've tried to pass it up quite a few times the last couple years.
[02:10:17.641 --> 02:10:19.141]  They're close to passing it now.
[02:10:19.501 --> 02:10:22.623]  Democrat senators offer gun control amendment for cyber security bill.
[02:10:22.843 --> 02:10:31.385]  The headline should be Democrats propose banning the possession of high-capacity mags, which is over 10.
[02:10:31.726 --> 02:10:35.807]  And the way I read the bill, they could even
[02:10:39.025 --> 02:10:47.516]  Do something like say, well, guns that can accept the magazines can't have this.
[02:10:48.197 --> 02:10:53.765]  So we'll get Larry, Larry Pretz, take on that as soon as we get him on the regular telephone.
[02:10:57.403 --> 02:11:02.165]  Because that is my wishes, to not just go with this Skype problem and stick with that.
[02:11:02.565 --> 02:11:03.245]  I want to switch.
[02:11:03.665 --> 02:11:08.807]  Three minutes of Skype not working, I want to go to alternate phone number back up in these interviews and then this won't happen.
[02:11:09.387 --> 02:11:11.228]  Skype is a great thing.
[02:11:12.148 --> 02:11:13.749]  Just message him on the thing.
[02:11:14.749 --> 02:11:17.090]  I'm not trying to direct people live on air, but if I direct it, it'll...
[02:11:18.561 --> 02:11:18.881]  I don't know.
[02:11:45.021 --> 02:11:45.921]  All righty then.
[02:11:46.342 --> 02:11:54.904]  Also, this is a, if you cut to the wide shot for people watching on PrisonPlanet.TV, we are listener-supported.
[02:11:55.285 --> 02:12:11.150]  And when you purchase books and videos and high-quality pro-pure water filters with 10% discounts with the promo code WATER, you fund this true, hardcore, pro-liberty, pro-America, pro-freedom system in the face of the globalists.
[02:12:12.080 --> 02:12:18.505]  And, you know, this t-shirt that one of our graphics people designed, I think it was Cade, is so popular.
[02:12:18.585 --> 02:12:25.210]  It is Hunter Orange with an InfoWars.com and the Gadsden Snake on a classic camouflage shirt.
[02:12:25.750 --> 02:12:30.694]  And this is our bestseller right now, along with the Live Free or Die.
[02:12:32.995 --> 02:12:37.198]  I saw somebody comment on the website today, they said, Live Free or Die Tryin'.
[02:12:37.378 --> 02:12:37.959]  I like that.
[02:12:38.019 --> 02:12:39.080]  I think that explains what
[02:12:40.083 --> 02:12:44.153]  What we're doing here, what we're shooting for, what's happening?
[02:12:45.638 --> 02:12:50.580]  So, again, please visit InfoWarshop.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:50.700]  888-253-3139.
[02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:53.341]  And they can take your order right here at the office.
[02:12:53.361 --> 02:12:55.501]  Or write to us at, what is that shirt?
[02:12:55.521 --> 02:12:55.501]  1995.
[02:12:55.662 --> 02:12:56.442]  Write to us at P.O.
[02:12:56.482 --> 02:12:57.342]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[02:13:14.588 --> 02:13:17.190]  And I guess I'll go to some calls while we're waiting for Larry.
[02:13:17.210 --> 02:13:21.472]  Oh, oh, oh, we now have him, and we have him, yeah, I guess, telephoned.
[02:13:22.212 --> 02:13:25.654]  Larry Pratt, thank you for getting on with us here today.
[02:13:26.575 --> 02:13:30.037]  What do you make of the announcement that Hal Guns won?
[02:13:30.097 --> 02:13:30.997]  Oops, just went dark.
[02:13:31.878 --> 02:13:32.118]  Hello?
[02:13:33.530 --> 02:13:35.811]  Yeah, I think we're having some technical stuff today.
[02:13:35.851 --> 02:13:36.832]  Ted couldn't hear me either.
[02:13:37.532 --> 02:13:39.093]  Yeah, let's put him back on hold.
[02:13:39.133 --> 02:13:43.175]  I don't think he can hear us, so... Something went on when the power went off today, guys.
[02:13:43.195 --> 02:13:44.336]  Ted Anderson couldn't hear me either.
[02:13:46.033 --> 02:13:52.116]  Okay, let's go back now to Larry Pratt here, broadcasting worldwide, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:13:52.956 --> 02:13:55.658]  Larry Pratt, head of Gun Owners of America.
[02:13:56.478 --> 02:13:57.979]  Good to have you here with us today.
[02:13:59.359 --> 02:14:06.363]  I know you're a man who is reserved, and you run the only no-compromise Second Amendment group out there that's in Washington.
[02:14:06.403 --> 02:14:13.406]  The NRA is kind of being drugged, kicking and screaming by you and others into being more proactive for the Second Amendment, as you point out.
[02:14:14.406 --> 02:14:19.510]  They were set up, the NRA, at the end of the Civil War to teach Northerners how to shoot as an auxiliary to the federal government.
[02:14:19.530 --> 02:14:24.434]  So that's why they've always had such a cozy relationship now with those that occupy the federal government.
[02:14:25.330 --> 02:14:31.576]  But we have Joe Klein saying, how guns won, why Americans have turned against gun control.
[02:14:32.577 --> 02:14:34.759]  And then they go on to basically say how horrible it is.
[02:14:34.799 --> 02:14:43.828]  But suddenly, Mr. Crystal, Mr. Michael Savage, Scalia's come out and said, oh, we could restrict you if something's scary, which isn't actually true.
[02:14:44.589 --> 02:14:45.130]  We've seen
[02:14:47.752 --> 02:14:50.773]  The head of News Corp, Rupert Murdoch, say you don't need semi-automatic.
[02:14:51.073 --> 02:14:58.214]  Since when did Fox News turn into the Michael Moore, Chuckie Schumer, Mayor Bloomberg channel?
[02:14:59.874 --> 02:15:01.535]  Since when did this happen, Mr. Pratt?
[02:15:02.535 --> 02:15:11.957]  Well, actually, all along, Fox News has been... I would say they're closer to what they claim to be, fair and balanced, than a conservative network.
[02:15:12.037 --> 02:15:13.077]  There are some
[02:15:13.669 --> 02:15:21.776]  Conservatives on there, the one that's most constitutional is Judge Napolitano, and he doesn't have his own show any longer.
[02:15:21.837 --> 02:15:37.711]  They bring him in as a contributing legal analyst, which is great because he's really super at that, but they're conservative without necessarily checking out the Constitution, and that's where a lot of folks run into trouble.
[02:15:37.771 --> 02:15:38.652]  They're not at liberty
[02:15:39.195 --> 02:16:03.191]  to want the government to do more than the we the people have allowed the government to do and we uh... i think even on the conservative side fall into the mindset that uh... brock obama clearly has when he was talking to a republican delegation at the white house he reminded them that well i won as if that means he can do anything he wants and that's not exactly right
[02:16:08.178 --> 02:16:17.720]  All of these people have to know that their entire base hates their guts now when Mr. Kristol comes out and says, we can ban all the semi-autos.
[02:16:17.740 --> 02:16:26.182]  I mean, there's clearly a concerted effort here when the Republican leadership is begging the Democrats to bring forward restrictions.
[02:16:27.142 --> 02:16:30.222]  I think they're going to pay for that at the ballot box.
[02:16:30.262 --> 02:16:33.063]  There are still primaries left this year.
[02:16:33.809 --> 02:16:38.291]  And some Republican heads could roll if they're willing to put themselves on that block.
[02:16:39.312 --> 02:16:43.534]  And the voters have already shown that they're willing to take out Republicans.
[02:16:44.335 --> 02:16:45.435]  Incumbents have lost.
[02:16:46.296 --> 02:16:57.522]  And in open primaries, people that might have had an easy time getting elected because of their prominence in other positions have lost in these primaries.
[02:16:57.542 --> 02:17:01.464]  With maybe a couple of exceptions at the federal level,
[02:17:02.028 --> 02:17:09.234]  The victories have been going to Tea Party type candidates, and that certainly includes pro-Second Amendment candidates.
[02:17:09.254 --> 02:17:21.584]  So they can talk like that at their own peril, and it shows me that they don't yet understand that guns is the third rail of American politics.
[02:17:22.045 --> 02:17:23.926]  You touch it at your own peril.
[02:17:24.707 --> 02:17:28.210]  Be advised, because you may come back in a political body bag.
[02:17:29.485 --> 02:17:31.906]  Larry Pratt, head of Gun Owners of America, is our guest.
[02:17:32.187 --> 02:17:42.773]  Larry, we've talked about the poll numbers showing that in the 60s and 70s it was maybe 55% pro-gun, the other 45% buying into the trendiness of the nanny state.
[02:17:43.333 --> 02:17:46.335]  I see numbers of over 70% now being pro-Second Amendment.
[02:17:46.655 --> 02:17:47.876]  People get it now that
[02:17:48.786 --> 02:17:50.387]  The government can't and won't protect you.
[02:17:50.627 --> 02:17:50.827]  Right.
[02:17:51.067 --> 02:17:53.167]  And so there's a major shift happening.
[02:17:53.748 --> 02:18:01.170]  What do you make of the anti-gunners now admitting this, but saying they're going to circle the wagons and come after us that much harder?
[02:18:02.151 --> 02:18:05.832]  Well, it's kind of what you expect from a fanatic.
[02:18:06.052 --> 02:18:13.754]  A fanatic is defined as someone who tries something and fails and redoubles their effort doing the same thing time and again.
[02:18:15.782 --> 02:18:18.384]  The fact is that they really don't get it.
[02:18:18.945 --> 02:18:33.156]  I did a debate in Spanish on CNN Español and this thing went on for an hour and when I would lay out some of the simple facts like from 1991 until the present, the U.S.
[02:18:33.236 --> 02:18:35.678]  murder rate has fallen by 50% from around
[02:18:40.018 --> 02:18:41.319]  8 to around 4 per 100,000.
[02:18:42.080 --> 02:18:53.689]  And that doesn't bode well for them because some 40 million guns were transacted in that period of time.
[02:18:54.270 --> 02:18:58.733]  America is armed to the teeth and yet the murder rate is substantially declining.
[02:18:59.214 --> 02:19:07.861]  And because there's 12 people that tragically lost their lives, as much as anything, because they didn't have a gun and nobody else did in the theater,
[02:19:08.533 --> 02:19:11.974]  We're supposed to rush into the gun control bag and say, you got us?
[02:19:12.354 --> 02:19:12.874]  I don't think so.
[02:19:12.894 --> 02:19:15.694]  Well, did you notice gun sales doubled the week after that happened?
[02:19:15.814 --> 02:19:17.815]  Already record numbers doubled that.
[02:19:18.215 --> 02:19:23.116]  And then I saw polls where there was people were even more pro-gun after the shooting.
[02:19:23.516 --> 02:19:24.916]  That's what's freaking them out.
[02:19:25.396 --> 02:19:26.937]  Is they stage Fast and Furious?
[02:19:27.057 --> 02:19:28.117]  I believe they stage this.
[02:19:28.177 --> 02:19:29.037]  All the signs are there.
[02:19:29.517 --> 02:19:36.639]  And people really get that now and go, no, I want a gun because there's a crazy Ronald McDonald murderer, you know, out there.
[02:19:36.699 --> 02:19:38.199]  You know, if that's even true.
[02:19:38.499 --> 02:19:46.586]  That is the message to take away, and that's what I was telling these left-wing media types in the frenzy following the shooting.
[02:19:46.646 --> 02:19:58.876]  I said, what you're doing is predictable, but let me tell you, I will predict that this has actually shifted opinion more in the favor of gun owners of America and gun owners generally.
[02:19:59.643 --> 02:20:05.827]  This is something where the American people realize, as you said Alex, the police can't be there to protect us.
[02:20:06.387 --> 02:20:07.287]  It's not their job.
[02:20:07.327 --> 02:20:08.368]  They don't have the numbers.
[02:20:08.668 --> 02:20:10.950]  It's just not going to happen.
[02:20:11.330 --> 02:20:18.094]  And the murderer in Aurora didn't choose the police station to start gunning people down.
[02:20:18.494 --> 02:20:19.734]  He went in through a door.
[02:20:19.754 --> 02:20:26.118]  Well, he entered the front door first, bought a ticket, and then went outside to get his guns during the showing of the
[02:20:26.471 --> 02:20:26.951]  of the film.
[02:20:28.972 --> 02:20:30.992]  He walked right by a no-gun sign.
[02:20:31.052 --> 02:20:31.613]  Exactly!
[02:20:31.653 --> 02:20:35.594]  They're talking about putting metal detectors in and having TSA style everywhere.
[02:20:35.974 --> 02:20:43.336]  All that means is that when a shooter shows up at the mall or the theater, they know they've got disarmed people that they can feed on.
[02:20:43.636 --> 02:20:50.222]  Absolutely, because he could go and do exactly what he did in the theater in Aurora, having gone through a metal detector.
[02:20:50.562 --> 02:20:52.103]  Wouldn't have made a hill of beans of difference.
[02:20:52.704 --> 02:20:57.428]  And I'll tell you what would happen if they put up metal directors at movie theaters.
[02:20:57.748 --> 02:20:59.930]  Netflix would say, yeah, do it, do it!
[02:21:01.091 --> 02:21:01.732]  Well, you're right.
[02:21:02.072 --> 02:21:04.854]  But I mean, what do you expect them to do now?
[02:21:04.934 --> 02:21:09.939]  I mean, they're certainly circling the wagons when suddenly all these Republicans come out and sound like
[02:21:10.976 --> 02:21:18.221]  Bill Clinton or people like Michael Moore, I mean, they are certainly desperate.
[02:21:18.321 --> 02:21:24.805]  What do you expect them to do now that they finally realize that everyone does the opposite of what they say?
[02:21:24.865 --> 02:21:26.086]  That everyone hates them.
[02:21:26.647 --> 02:21:27.807]  America's waking up.
[02:21:27.827 --> 02:21:29.148]  I mean, I'm not just typing that.
[02:21:29.769 --> 02:21:30.829]  Are you seeing the same thing?
[02:21:31.130 --> 02:21:31.810]  Absolutely.
[02:21:31.830 --> 02:21:35.272]  I was telling them that they were losing the propaganda battle.
[02:21:36.993 --> 02:21:40.596]  And actually, when I was on CNN Español, and I was
[02:21:40.936 --> 02:21:52.851]  Telling them nothing is going to happen because the American people are so against your gun grabbing that if you do anything, you're going to pay a price this November!
[02:21:53.292 --> 02:21:57.057]  And they said, yeah, that's right, we acknowledge that, but it's just really so bad!
[02:21:59.454 --> 02:22:07.876]  Well, I mean, look, you've got this domesticated America who grew up with parents that didn't teach them about guns, who literally, you know, men lay down while their wife gets raped.
[02:22:08.176 --> 02:22:15.758]  It's that minority of weirdos who want to be cowards and weak, who look at us, who are upstanding, armed, successful.
[02:22:16.158 --> 02:22:17.498]  I mean, we're not socialists.
[02:22:17.558 --> 02:22:18.038]  They are.
[02:22:18.078 --> 02:22:21.099]  I mean, it's just on every front, these are screwed up, dumb people.
[02:22:21.479 --> 02:22:23.820]  And look, we're tired of being lectured by them.
[02:22:24.160 --> 02:22:24.700]  It's over.
[02:22:25.040 --> 02:22:27.022]  They are losing momentum.
[02:22:27.462 --> 02:22:28.703]  Amen, brother.
[02:22:28.863 --> 02:22:32.306]  That is exactly what's happening and it does freak them out.
[02:22:33.707 --> 02:22:41.674]  I have not enjoyed anything more than dealing with the BBC or CNN or public broadcasting.
[02:22:41.694 --> 02:22:43.635]  This is an occasional commercial liberal.
[02:22:43.916 --> 02:22:45.017]  Doesn't have much of an audience.
[02:22:45.057 --> 02:22:46.338]  I was probably talking to myself.
[02:22:46.698 --> 02:22:53.844]  But they just don't know what to say or do other than, can't we just give peace a chance?
[02:22:55.410 --> 02:23:05.773]  Meanwhile, though, the federal government is arming 450 million hollow points, armored pillboxes, checkpoints, drones, armed drones.
[02:23:06.033 --> 02:23:09.854]  Hey, why can the government be arming to the teeth, but we're not supposed to be armed?
[02:23:10.154 --> 02:23:13.775]  You know, it almost strikes me that they're trying to preempt the market.
[02:23:14.055 --> 02:23:20.236]  If they buy that many, then the domestic manufacturers may really be very strapped.
[02:23:20.296 --> 02:23:22.357]  And, in fact, ammunition is quite pricey.
[02:23:23.959 --> 02:23:26.863]  Now, expanding on this...
[02:23:28.795 --> 02:23:30.016]  You were on the show Friday.
[02:23:30.036 --> 02:23:36.140]  Can you elaborate on the fact that you're saying we have to look at this as possibly being a false flag?
[02:23:37.261 --> 02:23:42.564]  I mean, even at the level of, there's the Air Force psychiatrist reprimanded for dangerous drugs to people.
[02:23:43.185 --> 02:23:47.428]  There is this dossier he supposedly sent him, what he was going to do, nothing was done.
[02:23:47.448 --> 02:23:49.249]  I mean, all the telltale signs.
[02:23:49.289 --> 02:23:52.831]  We've seen weird photoshops now of his gas mask at the scene.
[02:23:52.851 --> 02:23:54.613]  I mean, this whole thing looks set up.
[02:23:55.353 --> 02:24:12.990]  Yeah, after Fast and Furious, and you know me, I'm not one inclined to go with a conspiracy theory, but there really was a conspiracy in Fast and Furious, and the government not only conspired, they conspired to commit mass murder.
[02:24:13.310 --> 02:24:20.417]  Well, if they would do that, then indeed, how can we say that it's impossible that this guy wasn't prompted, goaded,
[02:24:20.817 --> 02:24:30.446]  Some way, led into, cooperated with, some kind of a government agent that was there to encourage him, maybe open the theater door, who knows?
[02:24:31.608 --> 02:24:37.173]  The fact of the matter is, if the government is investigating this, we're probably never going to find out.
[02:24:37.533 --> 02:24:44.280]  Once the FBI took this thing over, which just outrages me, they have no law enforcement authority constitutionally,
[02:24:44.721 --> 02:24:47.246]  And we're letting them conduct the investigation?
[02:24:47.266 --> 02:24:49.490]  The folks from Waco?
[02:24:49.811 --> 02:24:51.254]  The folks from Ruby Ridge?
[02:24:51.575 --> 02:24:53.318]  The folks from other disasters?
[02:24:53.699 --> 02:24:55.643]  We're letting THEM investigate this?
[02:24:57.523 --> 02:24:58.523]  Very frightening.
[02:24:59.343 --> 02:25:00.384]  What do you make?
[02:25:01.224 --> 02:25:06.685]  Why do you think, because they're always so deceptive, why would they come out in Time Magazine and announce they've lost?
[02:25:07.265 --> 02:25:09.145]  I mean, what is the point of that?
[02:25:09.645 --> 02:25:13.066]  Because then you read the article and they say, hey, don't worry, we'll still get their guns.
[02:25:13.426 --> 02:25:18.107]  But I mean, I mean, is this like a mayday emergency that, you know, the slaves have woken up?
[02:25:18.147 --> 02:25:18.787]  What are we going to do?
[02:25:19.407 --> 02:25:26.809]  I think it means they're desperate to get the president reelected because even he is somewhat restrained somewhat.
[02:25:27.613 --> 02:25:38.575]  Right now, because of the election contest, and as far as I can tell right now, he's going to lose and lose big, but if he were to get re-elected, oh buddy, it would be go for the gold.
[02:25:38.995 --> 02:25:42.896]  That would be just the end of the country, certainly the end of the Second Amendment.
[02:25:43.716 --> 02:25:49.037]  And I think what may have them so desperate is they can see that we hate them, as you were saying.
[02:25:49.457 --> 02:25:55.918]  Not only on the Second Amendment issue, but on so many other issues, the President has been the educator-in-chief.
[02:25:56.468 --> 02:26:02.313]  I don't think most people had a clue that there was a chance that we were going socialist in this country.
[02:26:02.793 --> 02:26:17.525]  But once we elected a socialist as president, and he is so tone-deaf, and actually rather incompetent, as the author of The Amateur argues in his book, Ed Klein,
[02:26:18.684 --> 02:26:21.025]  This guy really isn't that bright.
[02:26:21.326 --> 02:26:23.127]  He makes the same mistake twice.
[02:26:23.568 --> 02:26:27.331]  He doesn't seem to pay attention even to his own polling.
[02:26:28.051 --> 02:26:31.354]  The fact that... Start with Obamacare.
[02:26:32.115 --> 02:26:38.720]  The polls have said from the get-go that it was enormously unpopular, and people were really concerned about jobs.
[02:26:39.101 --> 02:26:40.602]  So, what did he do?
[02:26:40.662 --> 02:26:46.407]  Well, if it had been Bill Clinton, he probably would have worked both tracks, but certainly he would have at least faked it like he was
[02:26:46.967 --> 02:26:50.130]  Doing something about jobs, but this guy couldn't be bothered.
[02:26:50.190 --> 02:26:52.431]  That's because they want to destroy this country.
[02:26:52.672 --> 02:26:53.192]  Absolutely.
[02:26:53.392 --> 02:26:54.733]  Yeah, I mean they admit it.
[02:26:54.753 --> 02:26:57.655]  They want to post industrial countries, the UN and Maury Strong have said.
[02:26:57.956 --> 02:27:01.698]  They want to wreck it so they can make us go on welfare under their control.
[02:27:02.119 --> 02:27:12.126]  In closing, Larry Pratt of gunowners.org, the watchdog up there on Capitol Hill with your great organization and all your members, and the news alerts that are invaluable.
[02:27:12.186 --> 02:27:14.568]  People should visit it and sign up for the free news alerts right now.
[02:27:14.588 --> 02:27:15.069]  Thank you.
[02:27:15.669 --> 02:27:16.089]  That's good.
[02:27:16.109 --> 02:27:17.110]  We appreciate that.
[02:27:17.550 --> 02:27:22.914]  I see a false flag in the making because I know they're telling police and military to get ready for gun confiscation.
[02:27:22.954 --> 02:27:24.896]  I've got an army manuals where they're training for it.
[02:27:25.176 --> 02:27:27.018]  They're telling him something's coming in October.
[02:27:27.318 --> 02:27:28.519]  I'm not saying that's going to happen.
[02:27:28.539 --> 02:27:29.980]  The point is they're telling him it's coming.
[02:27:30.360 --> 02:27:30.560]  Right.
[02:27:32.205 --> 02:27:39.726]  If they try gun confiscation, or if they try to restrict, you will get resistance, and that could start a civil war.
[02:27:40.366 --> 02:27:44.867]  They might do it while they start a new war or something, thinking that we would patriotically get in line.
[02:27:45.367 --> 02:27:49.408]  Are you worried about them setting off a new war to get us in line for gun confiscation?
[02:27:50.308 --> 02:27:54.989]  Or trying to march the cops off to take the guns, and then a war will start?
[02:27:55.869 --> 02:28:01.570]  I can see them doing something that they think might bring them our favor, our support.
[02:28:02.940 --> 02:28:25.820]  Yes, save us from ourselves sort of thing, but honestly, while I have been concerned about that and we still should be looking out in case they actually do try something, I think now there is such a revulsion against this regime that if they tried something like that, it would just make us angrier and we would spit in their face with a loaded gun.
[02:28:26.638 --> 02:28:27.799]  By the way, I agree with you.
[02:28:27.839 --> 02:28:33.441]  There is true revulsion now for big government across the board, and it's only intensifying.
[02:28:33.821 --> 02:28:38.624]  See, we've been taught by these modern churches and stuff that we're all going to lose, the devil's going to take over.
[02:28:38.904 --> 02:28:40.945]  Folks, we don't know where we are in God's plan.
[02:28:41.005 --> 02:28:43.726]  We just have to do justice, may the heavens fall.
[02:28:44.386 --> 02:28:48.428]  And I'm telling you, I think we can beat these people and take America back.
[02:28:48.468 --> 02:28:55.852]  That's why the old line Republicans are panicking, saying, wait, gun control's good, because they understand we're getting ready to sweep them all away.
[02:28:56.112 --> 02:28:56.512]  That's right.
[02:28:56.773 --> 02:28:59.875]  They will have done it to themselves.
[02:29:00.295 --> 02:29:07.720]  They're as tone-deaf as is the President, and it's going to be probably a 2-3 election process.
[02:29:08.401 --> 02:29:16.646]  Senate elections may not avail us an opportunity for a few years for all of these guys, but we're making progress.
[02:29:16.726 --> 02:29:20.469]  I think we're likely to expand the majority in the House that they're
[02:29:21.119 --> 02:29:24.342]  We may actually get a conservative majority in the Republican caucus.
[02:29:24.362 --> 02:29:27.964]  Well, what's happening is the American people are really turning against the system.
[02:29:28.424 --> 02:29:28.945]  Absolutely.
[02:29:29.745 --> 02:29:32.427]  They know the system is not working for them.
[02:29:32.667 --> 02:29:36.430]  And so, okay, system, we're going to come and chop you apart.
[02:29:36.890 --> 02:29:37.411]  That's right.
[02:29:37.611 --> 02:29:38.151]  Absolutely.
[02:29:38.171 --> 02:29:39.512]  The sleeping giant is rising.
[02:29:39.552 --> 02:29:41.854]  Larry Pratt, thank you so much for your courage.
[02:29:41.894 --> 02:29:42.474]  God bless you.
[02:29:42.654 --> 02:29:45.096]  Thank you for what you're doing with your microphone, my friend.
[02:29:45.196 --> 02:29:45.597]  Thank you.
[02:29:45.737 --> 02:29:45.977]  All right.
[02:29:45.997 --> 02:29:48.679]  We'll be back with more defense of the republic and liberty.

[02:32:01.257 --> 02:32:02.257]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:32:02.477 --> 02:32:03.637]  What does freedom mean to you?
[02:32:03.978 --> 02:32:04.818]  The freedom to choose?
[02:32:04.878 --> 02:32:05.618]  The freedom to vote?
[02:32:05.838 --> 02:32:06.598]  The freedom to worship?
[02:32:06.838 --> 02:32:08.819]  How about the freedom to take control of your own future?
[02:32:09.059 --> 02:32:14.200]  My friends at eFoods Direct are celebrating freedom this month while helping you take control of your greatest dependency, food.

[02:33:42.708 --> 02:33:49.678]  Well, I've told you this for about six years because they have these big globalist consortium meetings and it's all public.
[02:33:50.319 --> 02:33:57.509]  That the new software, the operating systems, they've all got internet IDs embedded in them, not just your IP address.
[02:33:59.286 --> 02:34:04.987]  And the whole goal of this is when they say in the future you're not a good globalist, you're just going to be banned from the internet.
[02:34:05.007 --> 02:34:12.649]  You're going to be banned from travel, you're going to be banned from buying and shelling, and then you'll be hunted down and killed, taken to a re-education center and killed.
[02:34:13.810 --> 02:34:15.950]  And by the way, that's in all the army documents, that's public.
[02:34:15.990 --> 02:34:18.571]  I mean, I know that sounds crazy, reality's crazy.
[02:34:18.791 --> 02:34:19.851]  You ever studied other countries?
[02:34:20.571 --> 02:34:27.653]  What's happening here has happened everywhere over and over again, over and over again, even the supposed freest countries like England and France,
[02:34:28.672 --> 02:34:29.892]  In the past, not free now.
[02:34:30.733 --> 02:34:31.233]  And it's here.
[02:34:31.753 --> 02:34:33.574]  This is new at InfoWars.com.
[02:34:33.594 --> 02:34:34.754]  We've got to send this to Drudge.
[02:34:34.794 --> 02:34:35.595]  This is big news.
[02:34:36.955 --> 02:34:40.476]  NSA wants EasyPass control for the Internet.
[02:34:41.357 --> 02:34:45.858]  Now imagine, the National Security Agency is here telling us what we will do as Americans.
[02:34:46.439 --> 02:34:47.499]  Openly spying on us.
[02:34:49.674 --> 02:34:51.155]  It's just, it's incredible.
[02:34:51.275 --> 02:34:55.097]  Because they've learned if they just get on a stage and announce the crimes, it's like it's okay.
[02:34:55.777 --> 02:35:01.820]  Maybe they should have Sandusky to the meeting and, you know, they could have him rape a child on stage or something and that'll be okay because they did it on stage, you know.
[02:35:02.200 --> 02:35:06.382]  By the way, they've hired the head of Penn State to work for Homeland Security now in a secret position.
[02:35:06.402 --> 02:35:18.588]  Of course, joining the club, General Keith Alexander, the NSA boss who wants the government to centralize the internet and force users to use a system analogous to E-ZPass, a transponder.
[02:35:20.222 --> 02:35:24.707]  And he says, when you go down the highway and you go down the E-ZPass lane, what you're doing is sending a code.
[02:35:25.087 --> 02:35:28.270]  That system is not looking in your car, reading your email, or intercepting anything.
[02:35:28.671 --> 02:35:29.852]  It's just getting that code.
[02:35:29.992 --> 02:35:30.733]  Oh yeah, really?
[02:35:31.233 --> 02:35:35.177]  So you can set people up with it and track where you went, and then ban you from getting on the web.
[02:35:35.217 --> 02:35:36.399]  That's the whole point, you liar.
[02:35:36.639 --> 02:35:38.521]  But you're dealing with your enemy, the American people.
[02:35:38.861 --> 02:35:40.022]  You work for the bankers.
[02:35:40.343 --> 02:35:42.885]  You're an occupation general, a collaborator.
[02:35:43.948 --> 02:35:47.932]  In other words, the government should vet all uses with a checkpoint.
[02:35:48.412 --> 02:35:54.197]  All you need to pass is the fact of a signature, an IP address in real time, and we can take it from there.
[02:35:54.858 --> 02:35:57.200]  Yeah, we know you're already taking it from there, bud.
[02:35:57.220 --> 02:36:01.203]  NSA whistleblowers, more of them came out just last month.
[02:36:01.603 --> 02:36:03.185]  Everything's tracked in real time.
[02:36:04.906 --> 02:36:05.987]  So I'll say it right now.
[02:36:06.988 --> 02:36:08.650]  Proprietary software
[02:36:10.097 --> 02:36:20.388]  Microprocessor breakthrough works 20 times faster than the new programs that... I mean, I can just start putting a bunch of gibberish about patents and stuff out on there.
[02:36:20.408 --> 02:36:21.389]  That's what they really care about.
[02:36:21.409 --> 02:36:23.532]  They're stealing everything and shipping it offshore.
[02:36:23.912 --> 02:36:25.474]  Their job is to make sure America falls.
[02:36:25.814 --> 02:36:28.737]  Literally, this government is a pack of scum.
[02:36:29.278 --> 02:36:31.901]  A pack of New World Order trying to drown this nation.
[02:36:33.510 --> 02:36:35.111]  Trying to break us, trying to bring us down.
[02:36:35.131 --> 02:36:36.752]  I mean, I'll just say it.
[02:36:37.032 --> 02:36:40.513]  People think you do keywords like, uh, atomic bomb New York.
[02:36:40.713 --> 02:36:42.494]  Uh-uh, that isn't what gets their computers going.
[02:36:43.135 --> 02:36:45.216]  They already know where all those are at, they run those.
[02:36:47.637 --> 02:36:50.078]  Al-Qaeda operative caught by New York police.
[02:36:51.479 --> 02:36:53.700]  With CIA package and detonator.
[02:36:53.840 --> 02:36:56.940]  Ooh, that'll really get bing-bonged today by him.
[02:36:57.301 --> 02:36:58.161]  I mean, I could just sit here.
[02:36:58.361 --> 02:37:00.661]  We should all just start getting on the phones, just doing it 24-7.
[02:37:01.262 --> 02:37:05.423]  Going, we know you're terrorists, we know you're murderers, we know you're killers, we know you hate this country.
[02:37:07.083 --> 02:37:08.264]  You're like, man, you're really angry.
[02:37:08.324 --> 02:37:09.144]  Yeah, I'm angry.
[02:37:09.184 --> 02:37:10.124]  This is all illegal.
[02:37:10.164 --> 02:37:10.924]  It's a takeover.
[02:37:10.964 --> 02:37:11.644]  I've had enough.
[02:37:12.585 --> 02:37:14.745]  Hatred of these people will bring America back.
[02:37:15.766 --> 02:37:17.846]  Saying, you're criminals, we know what you're doing.
[02:37:18.026 --> 02:37:20.107]  Instead of them just like, okay, we spy on you illegally.
[02:37:20.127 --> 02:37:20.747]  What you gonna do about it?
[02:37:21.889 --> 02:37:22.949]  We've got to call them out.
[02:37:22.990 --> 02:37:23.970]  We've got to get in their face.
[02:37:23.990 --> 02:37:26.331]  We've got to stop just putting up with all this.
[02:37:26.571 --> 02:37:28.812]  We've got to have an equal response to what they're doing.
[02:37:29.212 --> 02:37:33.294]  Not just, oh yeah, yeah, they secretly disappear people and kill them now.
[02:37:33.834 --> 02:37:35.595]  Oh, we better do what they say.
[02:37:35.995 --> 02:37:37.536]  That way leads slavery.
[02:37:37.816 --> 02:37:39.097]  That way leads bondage.
[02:37:46.124 --> 02:37:51.767]  We're going to go to Julio Roseo here in just a moment, but that article is just off the charts because they're now announcing it.
[02:37:52.428 --> 02:37:53.728]  Going to Julio Roseo here in a moment.
[02:37:53.748 --> 02:37:54.129]  There's another one.
[02:37:54.389 --> 02:37:56.730]  More law enforcement agencies turning to pre-crime policing.
[02:37:57.411 --> 02:38:00.352]  Yeah, run by the former Sandusky boss.
[02:38:00.572 --> 02:38:06.036]  Literally, that's where they... There's all these articles where they're hiring all these pedophiles at the schools and everything.
[02:38:06.076 --> 02:38:08.097]  I mean, we're just... They're coming!
[02:38:08.737 --> 02:38:11.119]  And soon they're going to have drones and robots, the pedophiles are.
[02:38:11.139 --> 02:38:12.980]  They're incredible cowards.
[02:38:14.042 --> 02:38:17.465]  Big Sis has 30,000 drones for law enforcement, public safety.
[02:38:17.485 --> 02:38:23.731]  Law experts warn of threat of reasonable suspicion.
[02:38:23.771 --> 02:38:30.136]  Yeah, in New York, there's an article I got here on the stack where they're like, we're spying on your license plates, your face, and other secret things.
[02:38:31.237 --> 02:38:32.018]  Well, we know what it is.
[02:38:32.078 --> 02:38:35.041]  It's just all, and imagine that mobster Bloomberg.
[02:38:36.462 --> 02:38:39.825]  Who says you can't have sugar, can't have cigarettes, can't have water.
[02:38:40.085 --> 02:38:42.527]  Now he wants to make mothers breastfeed.
[02:38:42.547 --> 02:38:44.729]  Because there's been a PR backlash against him.
[02:38:44.769 --> 02:38:45.950]  Yeah, you should be breastfeeding.
[02:38:46.210 --> 02:38:48.052]  Yeah, formula is abusive to children.
[02:38:48.772 --> 02:38:51.474]  The mainline stuff is over 70% corn syrup.
[02:38:51.835 --> 02:38:53.076]  I've broken it down on air.
[02:38:54.137 --> 02:38:55.398]  It'll be part sugar, part corn.
[02:38:55.418 --> 02:38:55.698]  It's over 70.
[02:38:55.758 --> 02:38:57.760]  I mean, it's just frying children.
[02:38:58.600 --> 02:39:00.462]  But now Bloomberg comes out and says that.
[02:39:00.862 --> 02:39:02.604]  It isn't your place, okay?
[02:39:04.807 --> 02:39:07.599]  The nanny state kills us and then comes in and tries to save us.
[02:39:07.619 --> 02:39:09.788]  It's unbelievable.
[02:39:11.681 --> 02:39:13.522]  All right, I'm ranting here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:39:14.402 --> 02:39:26.128]  What they're going to do is, the model is going to be the Google NSA model, where if you have a YouTube channel now, and they claim you've been copyrighted a few times, they're tagging it to your cell phone, your email, and your database.
[02:39:26.188 --> 02:39:35.193]  And people now that are getting banned from YouTube can never get back on, no matter how many IP addresses, how many phone numbers, how many logins, unless they get somebody else to do it.
[02:39:35.433 --> 02:39:38.955]  But in the future, somebody else won't set up an account for you, because they'll lose it.
[02:39:39.355 --> 02:39:41.737]  It's like the IRS says you won't travel outside the country.
[02:39:43.198 --> 02:39:46.300]  If you haven't paid the Federal Reserve all your money, no judge, no jury.
[02:39:46.620 --> 02:39:48.722]  We are unleashing hell on ourselves.
[02:39:49.302 --> 02:39:50.924]  And it's time to turn back here.
[02:39:51.184 --> 02:39:53.305]  It's time to get nasty about this.
[02:39:53.586 --> 02:39:56.928]  And by nasty, I mean look at how nasty this is and disgusting.
[02:39:57.549 --> 02:40:00.151]  Really get angry at ourselves for letting it get this far.
[02:40:00.771 --> 02:40:04.433]  Let me tell you, I'm not strutting around here at the office feeling like I'm Mr. Tough Guy.
[02:40:04.774 --> 02:40:05.774]  I feel pathetic.
[02:40:06.175 --> 02:40:07.075]  I feel weak.
[02:40:07.536 --> 02:40:09.797]  I know how weak I am compared to my ancestors.
[02:40:10.177 --> 02:40:11.598]  I don't feel like I'm doing enough.
[02:40:11.938 --> 02:40:13.920]  I know how desperate the situation is.
[02:40:14.360 --> 02:40:14.680]  Okay?
[02:40:14.900 --> 02:40:17.662]  This is not... I'm not up here just yelling and screaming at everybody.
[02:40:17.702 --> 02:40:19.684]  We're in a lot of trouble here, okay?
[02:40:19.944 --> 02:40:20.884]  A lot of trouble!
[02:40:21.265 --> 02:40:22.205]  A lot of trouble!
[02:40:22.566 --> 02:40:23.186]  A lot!
[02:40:24.567 --> 02:40:27.549]  They're two inches from going around and starting to just snatch and grab people.
[02:40:27.869 --> 02:40:30.451]  They put that stuff on the books because they plan to use it.
[02:40:31.874 --> 02:40:34.475]  And they do plan on trying to start a civil war in this country.
[02:40:34.696 --> 02:40:42.840]  But because our forebearers were smart, smartest the world ever saw, they put liberty bombs in there that have been ticking and waiting until they were needed.
[02:40:44.002 --> 02:40:50.564]  It's like guardians or something, to use a Thor analogy, and they're guarding the, uh, you know, guarding, you know, the throne room, all the weapon systems.
[02:40:50.584 --> 02:40:52.484]  And when you step in there, it turns on.
[02:40:52.824 --> 02:40:53.865]  And that's what it is.
[02:40:54.645 --> 02:40:57.145]  That sleeping giant is awakening.
[02:40:57.726 --> 02:40:59.346]  The guardian is awakening.
[02:40:59.666 --> 02:41:00.826]  You are that guardian.
[02:41:01.487 --> 02:41:04.967]  Your whole life, your whole future, your life isn't about just partying and all that.
[02:41:05.208 --> 02:41:06.448]  That's why you're not fulfilled.
[02:41:07.369 --> 02:41:14.786]  Because if you just party all day long and you're not balanced, you're not fulfilled because hedonism will not fulfill you!
[02:41:16.439 --> 02:41:38.992]  When we make a special production video that's 10 minutes long and has all the facts, and I know it just totally proves everything we're saying, and I know it's going to reach millions of people, there is an intense feeling of total satisfaction that we are helping people, and we are unlocking minds, and we are helping put more energy into the collective hand, pulling a knife across the carotid arteries of the New World Order.
[02:41:40.956 --> 02:41:45.219]  And just collectively, the globalists can feel the spirit of liberty with that knife.
[02:41:45.559 --> 02:41:49.181]  And they're going, oh, they're going, and they're like, you can't win, you have no power.
[02:41:49.342 --> 02:41:50.322]  We're not listening to that anymore.
[02:41:50.482 --> 02:41:56.146]  We're collectively pulling, and we're going to pull right through until that whole head comes off, Medusa.
[02:41:57.027 --> 02:41:57.747]  You understand that?
[02:41:57.787 --> 02:41:59.608]  Your lives are going to be decapitated.
[02:42:00.089 --> 02:42:06.713]  The infowar is here, and the collective force is just, yeah, ha, yeah!
[02:42:07.594 --> 02:42:08.494]  You understand that?
[02:42:08.554 --> 02:42:09.815]  Just, ha, yeah!
[02:42:13.138 --> 02:42:15.499]  We are not your slaves, you murdering maggots!
[02:42:15.639 --> 02:42:18.660]  I understand their weaponized system, how they're brain damaging kids.
[02:42:18.680 --> 02:42:21.381]  Let me tell you, I'm in a Walgreens or a CVS.
[02:42:22.202 --> 02:42:31.266]  I was in one last night, went there to buy a pad of paper, and I saw on every corner, little bottles of water fluoridated for kids with way above what's in the tap water to brain damage them.
[02:42:31.486 --> 02:42:33.987]  And I almost just grabbed one and busted it on the floor.
[02:42:34.767 --> 02:42:42.674]  That's a normal response to weaponize chemicals to hurt little kids when the American Medical Association was forced to say people under 5 shouldn't ingest any fluoride.
[02:42:43.115 --> 02:42:45.136]  They've had to cut it back and say don't put it in the water.
[02:42:45.377 --> 02:42:49.660]  And I've got a Harvard study with over a dozen studies that it's brain damaging kids.
[02:42:50.301 --> 02:42:52.183]  And they say it threatens our whole humanity.
[02:42:52.383 --> 02:42:54.245]  Yeah, no kidding, that's the plan!
[02:42:54.625 --> 02:42:57.708]  And if you're not outraged by that, something's wrong with you.
[02:42:59.298 --> 02:43:01.379]  If you walked in your house one night at 2 a.m.
[02:43:01.419 --> 02:43:16.523]  to get a glass of orange juice, and you caught somebody in there putting something in the orange juice or the milk, and you tackled him, and you had your gun or whatever, and got the thing away from him, and it had skull and crossbones on it marked cyanide, you'd be madly angry, wouldn't you?
[02:43:18.503 --> 02:43:20.644]  See, this is a normal response, folks.
[02:43:20.684 --> 02:43:25.806]  If you don't feel like this about tyranny, you've had that switch turned off in you.
[02:43:26.166 --> 02:43:27.046]  This is normal.
[02:43:28.527 --> 02:43:30.288]  This is normal for our species.
[02:43:30.308 --> 02:43:32.210]  This is why we're top of the food chain, folks.
[02:43:32.390 --> 02:43:33.851]  Because we're not putting up with anything.
[02:43:33.891 --> 02:43:34.512]  You understand that?
[02:43:34.832 --> 02:43:36.913]  Instead, we're the opposite, putting up with anything.
[02:43:37.414 --> 02:43:40.216]  By a bunch of scum, the lowest of our species.
[02:43:40.536 --> 02:43:41.817]  I will not put up with it anymore.
[02:43:42.738 --> 02:43:48.983]  I will not, my one time with consciousness, on this plane of existence, sit here and go along with this.
[02:43:50.461 --> 02:43:51.801]  And that ain't special, folks.
[02:43:52.782 --> 02:43:54.982]  You've got to stop thinking of what I do as special.
[02:43:55.002 --> 02:43:56.902]  You have got to realize it's normal.
[02:43:57.263 --> 02:43:58.123]  This is normal.
[02:43:58.463 --> 02:43:59.163]  This is normal.
[02:43:59.223 --> 02:44:02.964]  I'm going to shut up now and go to Julio, who is a reporter.
[02:44:02.984 --> 02:44:04.624]  He's done reporting for Infowars.com.
[02:44:04.644 --> 02:44:06.185]  He's done it for We Are Change.
[02:44:06.225 --> 02:44:08.105]  We have video of this if you're a radio listener.
[02:44:08.125 --> 02:44:11.906]  I'm going to have it reposted at Infowars.com right now as one of the top tiles.
[02:44:13.587 --> 02:44:25.403]  And Julio, tell folks your story because we have the video you shot that got national attention of the TSA at the bus terminals and train stations searching people, setting up checkpoints, growth points.
[02:44:29.534 --> 02:44:31.415]  The George for Title channel out in L.A.
[02:44:31.455 --> 02:44:35.058]  he couldn't film, or they might ask him if he's a terrorist, but he still got the footage.
[02:44:36.419 --> 02:44:38.941]  So, this is happening everywhere, right on time, they're rolling out.
[02:44:39.221 --> 02:44:45.947]  And then they came and found you days later, and you have tape of that, and you stood your ground, saying you could be a terrorist for taping them.
[02:44:46.547 --> 02:44:48.168]  I mean, I'm glad I wasn't there, because I just can't.
[02:44:48.208 --> 02:44:49.870]  I just think, you listen here, you scum!
[02:44:50.450 --> 02:44:51.731]  Don't try to intimidate me!
[02:44:51.831 --> 02:44:52.752]  Move to North Korea!
[02:44:52.992 --> 02:44:55.333]  I'll videotape you running your checkpoint anytime you want.
[02:44:55.533 --> 02:44:57.174]  What you gonna do, put me on a no-fly list?
[02:44:57.654 --> 02:44:59.175]  What are you, a felon or something?
[02:44:59.215 --> 02:45:00.196]  I bet you're a felon!
[02:45:00.416 --> 02:45:02.217]  Go ahead and do something illegal, punk!
[02:45:02.757 --> 02:45:04.057]  I am so sick of these people!
[02:45:04.398 --> 02:45:05.318]  I don't care anymore!
[02:45:05.618 --> 02:45:06.779]  Julio, tell us what happened to you.
[02:45:07.605 --> 02:45:08.645]  Well, Alex, it's a pleasure.
[02:45:08.665 --> 02:45:11.227]  I've called so many times as a caller.
[02:45:11.247 --> 02:45:12.607]  It's an honor to be on as a guest.
[02:45:13.087 --> 02:45:14.868]  Excuse me, I'm a little raspy right now.
[02:45:14.908 --> 02:45:19.010]  Back on July 5th, day after Independence Day, I'm getting set to see the stand.
[02:45:19.110 --> 02:45:19.870]  I'm Preece McGee.
[02:45:19.930 --> 02:45:22.131]  I take the train into Union Station.
[02:45:22.171 --> 02:45:23.812]  I'm from the suburbs of Chicago.
[02:45:23.832 --> 02:45:26.713]  And I was shocked.
[02:45:26.813 --> 02:45:29.695]  I saw TSA agents in their full uniform.
[02:45:30.455 --> 02:45:34.557]  And, you know, being an independent reporter, it was just instinctive.
[02:45:35.097 --> 02:45:38.800]  To take out my cell phone and to start filming and just to see what they were doing.
[02:45:38.860 --> 02:45:46.887]  I was kind of in a hurry, but it was, you know, by the grace of God, perfect timing, I got my camera out and here comes TSA getting stuff through the checkpoint.
[02:45:47.208 --> 02:45:50.911]  And as you saw in that first video, TSA invades Chicago's Union Station.
[02:45:51.411 --> 02:45:56.212]  I mean, literally perfect timing, me filming and the TSA setting their checkpoints.
[02:45:56.312 --> 02:46:04.934]  Now, last Wednesday, July 18th, I go back to Union Station to meet with Mike Murphy of Why in the World Are They Spraying?
[02:46:05.594 --> 02:46:07.775]  And I see TSA agents again.
[02:46:07.855 --> 02:46:17.297]  And I just thought from two weeks ago that, oh, you know, TSA's just here, you know, maybe just for the Independence Day weekend and they're going to be gone.
[02:46:18.514 --> 02:46:21.816]  Looks like they're permanently staying at Union Station.
[02:46:21.856 --> 02:46:23.497]  And for folks that don't know... No, no, no, no, no!
[02:46:23.517 --> 02:46:25.078]  They got billions of funding.
[02:46:25.138 --> 02:46:26.839]  They sent the kits out nationwide.
[02:46:27.059 --> 02:46:28.379]  They're rolling out nationwide.
[02:46:28.419 --> 02:46:30.901]  And then next year, they're rolling out into every town.
[02:46:31.681 --> 02:46:32.862]  They're gonna be everywhere.
[02:46:32.942 --> 02:46:34.202]  They're gonna grope your wife.
[02:46:34.262 --> 02:46:34.823]  They're criminals.
[02:46:34.843 --> 02:46:35.243]  They love it.
[02:46:36.229 --> 02:46:40.971]  Chicago is the third largest media market in the country, followed by New York and L.A., one and two.
[02:46:41.631 --> 02:46:51.195]  And if it wasn't for my video, people around the Chicagoland area, or your listeners, or anyone throughout the world, wouldn't have known that TSA is in Chicago's unions.
[02:46:51.315 --> 02:46:56.436]  And they keep saying, oh, it's terrorism if you don't tell us you're coming, as if you're not media.
[02:46:56.456 --> 02:46:57.317]  So tell people what happened.
[02:46:57.337 --> 02:47:00.138]  You shot video, then they find you weeks later.
[02:47:00.922 --> 02:47:09.507]  Right, I went to the Metro, it's like a bar and grill type thing at Union Station, and that's where TSA agents were eating lunch.
[02:47:09.927 --> 02:47:14.750]  So I wanted to do a film, our taxpayer dollars is giving TSA lunch at Union Station.
[02:47:14.830 --> 02:47:27.378]  And then while I'm sitting, I'm trying to be discreet, an Amtrak police officer comes up to me and he says, hey, as you saw in the video, you're the one that filmed us last week, you put it on YouTube, and I tried to
[02:47:28.078 --> 02:47:28.839]  Well yeah, you're the enemy!
[02:47:28.859 --> 02:47:29.599]  You're the American people!
[02:47:29.619 --> 02:47:35.262]  You're not allowed to film gods while they violate people's fourth amendment and take over criminally!
[02:47:55.219 --> 02:48:00.340]  And because I did that, I gave terrorists an opportunity to know where they were.
[02:48:00.360 --> 02:48:09.942]  And remember, Alex, before NATO, I was with Luke Wadowski in downtown Chicago, and an undercover officer said, if you put this picture on YouTube, I could get shot by a terrorist.
[02:48:10.322 --> 02:48:14.643]  Yeah, oh, you mean the terrorists they're putting in Libya and Syria and the underwear bomber they got on the plane?
[02:48:14.823 --> 02:48:17.264]  That's why we've got to overturn their fake terror.
[02:48:17.444 --> 02:48:19.124]  Their bosses staged the terror.
[02:48:19.684 --> 02:48:20.685]  It's totally made up.
[02:48:20.965 --> 02:48:21.665]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:48:22.344 --> 02:48:23.925]  No, don't worry, Alex.
[02:48:24.265 --> 02:48:25.685]  Everyone should be upset by this.
[02:48:25.745 --> 02:48:31.107]  Everyone should be, you know, should be angry that our taxpayer dollars is funding this.
[02:48:31.247 --> 02:48:35.148]  And, you know, sooner or later we're going to see the body scanners.
[02:48:35.188 --> 02:48:39.069]  We're going to see the full groping at the train stations.
[02:48:39.589 --> 02:48:44.971]  And this Amtrak police officer kept saying, you know, I don't have a right to show what TSA is doing.
[02:48:45.871 --> 02:48:51.333]  He admitted that the government sent them my video and they were very upset by that.
[02:48:51.573 --> 02:48:53.036]  And by the way, you taped all that.
[02:48:53.056 --> 02:48:55.200]  Have you gotten any word since you put that out?
[02:48:55.220 --> 02:48:56.502]  We're going to play some of it when we come back.
[02:48:57.702 --> 02:48:58.122]  I have not.
[02:48:58.303 --> 02:49:00.144]  I haven't been to Union Station in a week.
[02:49:00.584 --> 02:49:02.506]  And I usually go... I'm from the suburbs.
[02:49:02.686 --> 02:49:04.948]  I don't have a car, so... I'm an independent journalist.
[02:49:04.988 --> 02:49:06.850]  I take the train into the city for some of that.
[02:49:06.890 --> 02:49:07.230]  No, no, no.
[02:49:07.270 --> 02:49:14.336]  It's a Nazi political checkpoint of commissars in their outside color of law telling you you can't film in a public commons.
[02:49:14.356 --> 02:49:15.357]  They're totally full of bull.
[02:49:15.377 --> 02:49:22.502]  It's like the cops that shot the guy in handcuffs in San Francisco and confiscated all the cameras and then got caught because one person didn't turn it over.
[02:49:22.522 --> 02:49:23.263]  I mean, look.
[02:49:23.944 --> 02:49:26.526]  You live in a state, though, where they try to indict you for filming them.
[02:49:27.046 --> 02:49:29.968]  I mean, it doesn't matter how many times it gets overthrown, they're a mafia government.
[02:49:30.229 --> 02:49:34.432]  So how did it end as they were trying to convert Chicago fully to North Korea?
[02:49:38.025 --> 02:49:40.467]  How's it going to end, you ask?
[02:49:40.907 --> 02:49:48.251]  Well, you know, it ended... I gave him my ID and, you know, after that I'm like, am I being detained?
[02:49:48.411 --> 02:49:49.412]  Am I being detained at all?
[02:49:49.492 --> 02:49:50.592]  If not, can I leave?
[02:49:50.953 --> 02:49:52.013]  Because I don't want to be here.
[02:50:02.554 --> 02:50:11.501]  And I'm thankful that, you know, the Lord has given me a sense of calmness during these type of events where I didn't overreact or I didn't, you know, raise my voice at all.
[02:50:11.521 --> 02:50:13.063]  I was just very calm and collected.
[02:50:13.103 --> 02:50:15.765]  Yeah, in my experience, more and more, it gets their attention.
[02:50:16.746 --> 02:50:17.346]  Right.
[02:50:17.466 --> 02:50:28.175]  In the video, you can see that police officer was trying to be very intimidated, being a bully to me, you know, saying, America, nothing, and that... Oh yeah, oh yeah, you say, but America has freedom.
[02:50:28.195 --> 02:50:29.456]  He goes, America, nothing.
[02:50:30.137 --> 02:50:30.277]  Oh.
[02:50:30.337 --> 02:50:31.438]  I thought this was America.
[02:50:31.758 --> 02:50:32.799]  He says America nothing.
[02:50:32.839 --> 02:50:34.640]  He says, oh, I'm a federal worker.
[02:50:34.920 --> 02:50:40.342]  And I go on to ask him, well, who funds the federal government, Mr. Amtrak police officer?
[02:50:40.382 --> 02:50:41.403]  The people fund that.
[02:50:41.443 --> 02:50:45.285]  So we, the people, have a right to know about what the TSA is doing.
[02:50:45.345 --> 02:50:48.207]  No one's reporting that the TSA is that train station.
[02:50:48.227 --> 02:50:52.629]  So I have a duty as an independent journalist and as a citizen of the U.S.
[02:50:53.769 --> 02:50:57.451]  Well, the Drudge Report is taking our reports and putting them out nationwide.
[02:50:57.471 --> 02:51:01.132]  He covered the one out of California, but the White House wants him shut down.

[02:53:05.051 --> 02:53:06.132]  Well, think again.
[02:53:06.572 --> 02:53:10.555]  Millions of honest, hard-working Americans have had their homes stolen by the banks.
[02:53:10.976 --> 02:53:11.816]  There is an answer.
[02:53:12.357 --> 02:53:14.999]  The answer is MortgageEndgame.com.

[02:53:32.532 --> 02:53:34.033]  On time every month with your payments?
[02:53:34.254 --> 02:53:35.134]  It doesn't matter.

[02:54:09.076 --> 02:54:12.999]  We're going to get final comments from Julio Roseo from Chicagoland.
[02:54:13.019 --> 02:54:15.460]  Here in a moment, I'm going to play some of the audio and video.
[02:54:16.501 --> 02:54:18.242]  First, he shows the video of the checkpoints.
[02:54:18.262 --> 02:54:19.403]  Then they come over and confront him.
[02:54:19.463 --> 02:54:23.425]  Two weeks later, the secret police saying, you could be a terrorist.
[02:54:23.445 --> 02:54:24.466]  You're like, well, it's America.
[02:54:24.486 --> 02:54:27.048]  I can film here in this mall area what you're doing.
[02:54:27.588 --> 02:54:28.789]  America nothing!
[02:54:29.529 --> 02:54:30.930]  America nothing!
[02:54:31.410 --> 02:54:34.311]  Well, yeah, that means your bank accounts, your private property, your kids.
[02:54:34.631 --> 02:54:37.293]  They're inoculating people now without authorization.
[02:54:37.313 --> 02:54:39.714]  They just do what they want because they got guns.
[02:54:40.834 --> 02:54:41.975]  The bankers want it that way.
[02:54:42.015 --> 02:54:43.696]  It's a lawless criminal takeover.
[02:54:44.456 --> 02:54:47.297]  Let's go to this report.
[02:54:47.357 --> 02:54:47.917]  Here it is.
[02:54:48.178 --> 02:54:48.738]  Let's take a look.
[02:54:49.414 --> 02:54:55.761]  Alright, WeAreChange is very happy to announce that we have a new correspondent in the Midwest, Julio Rossell of Illinois.
[02:54:56.161 --> 02:55:03.328]  Now, two weeks ago, Julio released a great video showing how TSA agents were setting up a checkpoint at the Union train station in Chicago.
[02:55:03.409 --> 02:55:05.351]  We have TSA agents
[02:55:05.911 --> 02:55:07.512]  You know, these aren't police officers.
[02:55:07.572 --> 02:55:09.093]  They don't have a right to grope us.
[02:55:09.133 --> 02:55:11.074]  They don't have a right to wear any badges.
[02:55:11.094 --> 02:55:14.076]  They're not authorized law enforcement agents.
[02:55:14.136 --> 02:55:17.918]  Yet, they have the audacity to do what they do at the airports.
[02:55:17.958 --> 02:55:21.240]  They have the audacity to come to our train stations.
[02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:26.663]  Now the video was a big hit, even with Amtrak police who worked within Union Station.
[02:55:27.283 --> 02:55:36.329]  And they actually targeted and found Julio a week later when he was having dinner at Union Station, came up to him, and tried to intimidate and harass him.
[02:55:36.749 --> 02:55:41.072]  But as a good journalist always does, he took out the video camera and recorded everything that happened.
[02:55:41.365 --> 02:55:41.886]  What's the law?
[02:55:42.266 --> 02:55:46.130]  Are you going to listen or are you going to be kicked out of here and you're going to piss me off?
[02:55:46.410 --> 02:55:48.092]  I don't want to piss you off.
[02:55:48.132 --> 02:55:48.673]  You're going to listen.
[02:55:48.793 --> 02:55:49.674]  I want to listen to him.
[02:55:49.734 --> 02:55:50.034]  Listen!
[02:55:50.054 --> 02:55:51.256]  I want to know what law.
[02:55:51.296 --> 02:55:52.016]  You're still talking.
[02:55:52.097 --> 02:55:54.019]  I'm telling you to your face.
[02:55:54.099 --> 02:55:54.279]  Yes.
[02:55:54.319 --> 02:55:55.220]  Do not videotape us.
[02:55:55.280 --> 02:55:56.682]  If you come beyond that point,
[02:55:58.283 --> 02:56:00.146]  But I'm not beyond that point, I'm here at the restaurant.
[02:56:00.326 --> 02:56:07.896]  If you come, like you did before, come beyond that point, you're going to jail, sir, because it could be used for terrorist activity.
[02:56:08.276 --> 02:56:12.722]  Right now, you're in violation because of- What kind of terror?
[02:56:13.783 --> 02:56:18.067]  People know a time, the date, you gave an explanation about TSA.
[02:56:18.127 --> 02:56:19.207]  Yeah, but I'm a reporter.
[02:56:19.228 --> 02:56:20.909]  I don't know who you are.
[02:56:20.949 --> 02:56:21.850]  I'm a reporter.
[02:56:21.890 --> 02:56:22.971]  Tell me how you were a reporter.
[02:56:23.231 --> 02:56:25.513]  Did you approach us and say, hey, I want to take video?
[02:56:25.813 --> 02:56:26.934]  I didn't think I had to.
[02:56:26.954 --> 02:56:27.955]  I thought this was America.
[02:56:28.355 --> 02:56:30.016]  No, America nothing.
[02:56:30.316 --> 02:56:31.537]  You know better.
[02:56:31.577 --> 02:56:32.038]  Where's your ID?
[02:56:33.779 --> 02:56:35.280]  I'm not doing anything illegal.
[02:56:35.360 --> 02:56:36.641]  I'm not gonna give you my ID.
[02:56:36.701 --> 02:56:37.842]  I'm not doing anything illegal.
[02:56:37.882 --> 02:56:39.183]  Give me your ID.
[02:56:39.263 --> 02:56:39.963]  For what's the reason?
[02:56:40.383 --> 02:56:42.565]  Because right now- I'm not at the security checkpoint.
[02:56:42.585 --> 02:56:43.766]  I'm not at the ambulance.
[02:56:43.806 --> 02:56:44.906]  Wait a minute.
[02:56:44.946 --> 02:56:47.128]  You did do it with Justin Ketchum.
[02:56:47.168 --> 02:56:49.029]  You gotta remember something.
[02:56:49.549 --> 02:56:49.809]  You did.
[02:56:49.850 --> 02:56:50.610]  You did a violation.
[02:56:50.690 --> 02:56:52.231]  We don't know who's gonna go on YouTube.
[02:56:52.251 --> 02:56:53.372]  All right, that's enough.
[02:56:54.332 --> 02:57:03.563]  This is about political checkpoints that are going to be on every major street corner and they're just going to pull you over, get you out, army truck, re-education.
[02:57:04.704 --> 02:57:06.447]  I'm serious, the army trains for this now.
[02:57:07.288 --> 02:57:10.451]  And the TSA are their little weirdo minders like the brown shirts.
[02:57:11.508 --> 02:57:13.029]  And, uh, there's a bunch of other videos.
[02:57:13.049 --> 02:57:14.249]  There's other ones barking at him.
[02:57:14.269 --> 02:57:15.010]  We're gonna get you!
[02:57:15.030 --> 02:57:15.830]  We're gonna get you!
[02:57:15.850 --> 02:57:19.232]  Uh, Julio, I guess this is the new America.
[02:57:19.252 --> 02:57:23.434]  Uh, I told everybody it was coming, and next phase, they're gonna be everywhere.
[02:57:23.934 --> 02:57:25.454]  And they are beginning the groping.
[02:57:25.675 --> 02:57:29.936]  By the way, I've seen video at bus and train stations where they even strip children.
[02:57:30.497 --> 02:57:34.318]  So, there's nothing that's enough for them to keep us safe from the terrorists, yes.
[02:57:34.639 --> 02:57:36.179]  Notice how we're the terrorists now.
[02:57:36.479 --> 02:57:39.301]  Notice, you were told, your journalism is terrorism, pal.
[02:57:40.609 --> 02:58:09.359]  Well, Alex, I wasn't going to release this video, and then after the Colorado shooting and reading some documents, one from New Jersey's Fusion Center, the New Jersey Regional Operations Intelligence Center, and literally this report came out 14 hours after the shooting in Colorado, an incident assessment, and they go on to admit here in page four, you know, we could see more lone offender and homegrown extremist, and then in page five, they admit
[02:58:09.919 --> 02:58:24.006]  That now, uh, photography, photographing or videotaping facilities, security posts, or exit and entry posts, uh, taking notes is now deemed suspicious activity.
[02:58:24.026 --> 02:58:29.229]  And again, this is... Yeah, no, no, they're taking over America and planting the banker flag.
[02:58:29.249 --> 02:58:33.491]  They're putting us under martial law, and they have your picture up there.
[02:58:33.551 --> 02:58:34.852]  I mean, you know, two weeks later,
[02:58:35.732 --> 02:58:38.677]  You're in a restaurant, and they're gonna let you know, you little American.
[02:58:38.697 --> 02:58:40.119]  You're a slave now, boy!
[02:58:42.964 --> 02:58:44.826]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:51.343 --> 02:58:55.566]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:58:55.886 --> 02:58:56.487]  Number 1.
[02:58:56.807 --> 02:58:59.949]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:59:00.230 --> 02:59:00.790]  Number 2.
[02:59:01.090 --> 02:59:05.654]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:05.974 --> 02:59:06.414]  It's true.
[02:59:06.734 --> 02:59:11.278]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:11.598 --> 02:59:12.138]  Number 3.
[02:59:12.419 --> 02:59:15.701]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:59:16.001 --> 02:59:19.704]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:59:19.904 --> 02:59:20.465]  Number 4.
[02:59:20.705 --> 02:59:23.067]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:59:23.467 --> 02:59:26.850]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:59:27.150 --> 02:59:27.351]  Number 5.
[02:59:27.931 --> 02:59:31.854]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:59:32.095 --> 02:59:36.839]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:59:37.139 --> 02:59:41.163]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:59:53.876 --> 02:59:55.278]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.918 --> 02:59:59.142]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:04.330 --> 03:00:05.971]  Central Texas Command Center.
[03:00:06.271 --> 03:00:11.094]  In the heart of the resistance, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:12.795 --> 03:00:18.319]  Alright, doing a quick five minutes with Julio Rossello, then we're going to continue into retransmission, but we're live right now.
[03:00:19.900 --> 03:00:25.123]  Look, I almost want to, I don't have the time to do it, I'm busy fighting the globalists here, but I almost want to go to Chicago.
[03:00:26.607 --> 03:00:29.529]  And go in there and just let them beat me down, let them arrest me.
[03:00:29.549 --> 03:00:32.871]  I know it's a mafia town and stuff, but we've got to make a stand, sue them.
[03:00:33.231 --> 03:00:35.593]  Rob Dude just won a big lawsuit against Pittsburgh.
[03:00:36.353 --> 03:00:39.875]  And you know, he got arrested for no reason, trying to cover it.
[03:00:40.216 --> 03:00:42.037]  But I'm going to personally sue these people.
[03:00:42.637 --> 03:00:45.240]  I mean, these are just horrible creatures.
[03:00:47.842 --> 03:00:49.444]  We only played a short clip of this.
[03:00:50.365 --> 03:00:54.469]  But as you said, you had to release this video now because they may just try to disappear you.
[03:00:54.829 --> 03:00:59.313]  I mean, I guess you're in this giant mall area of the train station.
[03:01:00.835 --> 03:01:07.143]  People are walking around with their video cameras, the government's surveilling you, as if terrorists don't want to know when there's a checkpoint.
[03:01:07.343 --> 03:01:08.765]  This is all just slave training.
[03:01:09.826 --> 03:01:14.773]  And so, I mean, they told you, too, on the tape, they said, we were sent here by the government.
[03:01:15.193 --> 03:01:17.276]  So they are, they're political commissars.
[03:01:17.356 --> 03:01:17.937]  Very creepy.
[03:01:18.837 --> 03:01:19.317]  It is creepy.
[03:01:19.357 --> 03:01:23.379]  Here's a Homeland Security document from this month, July 2012.
[03:01:24.520 --> 03:01:28.242]  Performance Venues, Indicators of Violence and Perspective Measures.
[03:01:28.842 --> 03:01:40.729]  Reiterates the New Jersey's Fusion Center documents and admits indicators of surveillance by potential attackers include persons using or carrying video camera observation equipment,
[03:01:41.289 --> 03:01:54.500]  In a near facility over an extended period of time, or a person using maps or photographs, and they admit performance venues include theaters, concert halls, auditoriums, amphitheaters, sports venues.
[03:01:54.520 --> 03:01:58.944]  So now we're going to see Homeland Security, TSA at these venues.
[03:01:58.964 --> 03:02:06.891]  So I felt the need to release this video and to point out, number one, that Amtrak police admitted to me this
[03:02:06.971 --> 03:02:10.274]  This wasn't on camera, but they admitted to me that they read these documents.
[03:02:10.334 --> 03:02:14.438]  I told them about Homeland Security's right-wing extremist document.
[03:02:14.478 --> 03:02:19.422]  The guy admitted to me, yeah, I dealt with sovereign citizens yesterday at Union Station.
[03:02:19.442 --> 03:02:22.986]  So police, Amtrak police, they all read these documents.
[03:02:23.066 --> 03:02:30.733]  And there's a roll call document, May 17, 2012, Homeland Security and the FBI, warning of theater attacks.
[03:02:31.013 --> 03:02:40.999]  So folks, if we do have a terrorist attack in this country, we need to fire every single intelligent person, Neapolitano, all of these people.
[03:02:41.099 --> 03:02:44.942]  Oh no, they always get more power because they're the ones staging it.
[03:02:44.982 --> 03:02:45.462]  Exactly.
[03:02:46.023 --> 03:02:56.389]  And so I plead with the people, don't be afraid, don't be intimidated, pray to the Lord above, or just believe in love, and go out and film the TSA.
[03:02:56.849 --> 03:02:57.550]  Don't be afraid.
[03:02:58.270 --> 03:03:17.079]  Folks, they have announced they are setting up checkpoints on highways, and I'm telling you, I don't go to the airport with my family because I can't have the pedos go after them, and most of them are admitted pedos, even convicted ones, but I've gotten to the point where, I mean, you know, you're not, I pull up, you got army trucks, a checkpoint, I mean, I'm sorry perverts, you're not, you're not groping us.
[03:03:17.519 --> 03:03:19.100]  I mean, they're just murdering criminals.
[03:03:19.120 --> 03:03:19.580]  I mean, it just,
[03:03:20.020 --> 03:03:22.382]  That's just a bunch of criminal trash that took over.
[03:03:22.643 --> 03:03:24.024]  We know who y'all are, filth.
[03:03:24.364 --> 03:03:26.486]  You can read all your pipe dreams about terrorists.
[03:03:26.526 --> 03:03:29.689]  Your daddy, the big banks, runs all those terrorists, okay?
[03:03:29.950 --> 03:03:30.470]  We're done.
[03:03:30.490 --> 03:03:30.570]  Yeah.
[03:03:32.062 --> 03:03:39.624]  Quickly, when that Amtrak police officer told me that the government sent them my video, for a second I was kind of scared, oh no, they're monitoring me.
[03:03:40.004 --> 03:03:44.345]  But after I thought it over, I felt very proud.
[03:03:44.385 --> 03:03:45.285]  I wear it as a badge of honor.
[03:03:45.305 --> 03:03:46.925]  No, it shows they're criminals.
[03:03:47.005 --> 03:03:48.445]  It shows the system's criminal.
[03:03:48.785 --> 03:03:55.127]  They're scared of you showing what they're doing because what they're doing is illegal and they want to phase it in.
[03:03:55.687 --> 03:03:58.528]  Look, we got it kicked out in Houston because they had one protest.
[03:03:58.908 --> 03:04:00.328]  We're going to kick this out everywhere.
[03:04:01.098 --> 03:04:05.280]  They don't want it known because they want to sneak up on us because they're like a thief in the night.
[03:04:06.100 --> 03:04:13.183]  And like I said in one of these videos, you don't have to be a good-looking person with a sharp suit and a teleprompter to be a journalist.
[03:04:13.263 --> 03:04:14.323]  I'm 22 years old.
[03:04:14.363 --> 03:04:16.264]  I'll be 23 in a couple of weeks.
[03:04:16.664 --> 03:04:19.466]  And I felt, you know, I studied broadcasting in college.
[03:04:19.566 --> 03:04:20.486]  I know the tricks.
[03:04:20.826 --> 03:04:21.947]  I know the deception.
[03:04:21.967 --> 03:04:24.948]  And so I felt that it's my obligation.
[03:04:25.128 --> 03:04:27.589]  I'm not going to war, but I'll go to the info war.
[03:04:27.849 --> 03:04:30.290]  And I'm willing to do this for my family, for people
[03:04:30.450 --> 03:04:31.190]  You've got to do it.
[03:04:31.231 --> 03:04:33.932]  It's not just that you're willing, Julio.
[03:04:33.952 --> 03:04:35.233]  You have no future if you don't.
[03:04:35.273 --> 03:04:35.833]  God bless you.
[03:04:36.213 --> 03:04:37.714]  Everybody should join Julio.
[03:04:38.134 --> 03:04:39.735]  Everybody should go to that station.
[03:04:40.015 --> 03:04:44.398]  In fact, everybody should go there tomorrow at noon central.
[03:04:44.658 --> 03:04:46.219]  We'll cover it live on the radio.
[03:04:46.479 --> 03:04:47.860]  Let's have a hundred people.
[03:04:48.140 --> 03:04:49.361]  Now let's give people a few days.
[03:04:49.741 --> 03:04:51.242]  They'll just pull out that day.
[03:04:51.282 --> 03:04:51.982]  That's how they work.
[03:04:52.182 --> 03:04:54.624]  They never want to give us a chance to show we're the boss.
[03:04:55.804 --> 03:04:57.125]  Everybody show up tomorrow at noon.
[03:04:57.185 --> 03:04:57.786]  Let's just do that.
[03:04:57.826 --> 03:04:59.206]  Everybody get there at noon.
[03:04:59.246 --> 03:04:59.847]  Videotape them.
[03:05:01.803 --> 03:05:05.386]  For more than six years, I've talked on the air about creating a social network.
[03:05:05.686 --> 03:05:08.349]  PlanetInfoWars.com is in its beta phase.
[03:05:08.629 --> 03:05:14.954]  We're just launching it, and I want to invite all of you out there to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:05:15.275 --> 03:05:15.735]  It's true.
[03:05:16.035 --> 03:05:17.977]  Total government control of electricity.
