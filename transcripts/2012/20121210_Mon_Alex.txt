[00:00:06.926 --> 00:00:11.109]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:12.590]  You want answers?
[00:00:13.371 --> 00:00:14.251]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.892 --> 00:00:18.494]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:19.095 --> 00:00:23.158]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.896 --> 00:00:38.277]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday.
[00:00:39.698 --> 00:00:40.159]  Monday.
[00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:44.261]  The 10th day of December 2012.
[00:00:46.302 --> 00:00:50.865]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we are going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:58.149]  Once a week, while his show is airing, we're going to be visited by Jesse Ventura, and today is that day.
[00:00:58.169 --> 00:01:01.751]  We need to call and confirm that he is going to be popping in at the
[00:01:04.238 --> 00:01:06.160]  Start of the next hour for about 30 minutes.
[00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:17.857]  We're going to have open phones today to give you a chance to chime in on the conversion of our Republic from a once quasi free nation to a globalist held enclave.
[00:01:18.846 --> 00:01:29.859]  And so that is going to be coming up today as well as we look at the fiscal cliff that is just used as a manipulative backdrop to say oh we've got to increase taxes or the whole country will implode.
[00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:38.288]  It's just a repeat of being held hostage in 2008 saying give us unlimited funding or there'll be martial law.
[00:01:39.485 --> 00:01:45.870]  Remember how the head of the Treasury, Paulson, came out and told Congress that.
[00:01:46.811 --> 00:01:49.533]  So, that's exactly what's going on.
[00:01:49.593 --> 00:01:52.676]  That's exactly what's unfolding right now.
[00:01:52.696 --> 00:01:54.798]  We'll give you the latest on that.
[00:01:54.918 --> 00:02:00.242]  Also, a lot of reports of increasing crime, not just here in the United States, but in Europe as well.
[00:02:00.582 --> 00:02:03.184]  This global depression is just starting to get rolling.
[00:02:03.565 --> 00:02:07.088]  And again, it's a consolidation program on purpose.
[00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:09.729]  Also, I knew it was going to happen.
[00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:19.872]  I made the joke yesterday, not really the joke, I was pointing out what a joke Bob Costas is, that he's blaming people for violence out there.
[00:02:19.892 --> 00:02:21.313]  He was blaming guns, not people.
[00:02:22.673 --> 00:02:35.898]  And I made the point that I wonder if Bob Costas will blame this Dallas Cowboy flipping the vehicle with his friend Jerry Brown, one of the starting linemen, and killing him.
[00:02:36.943 --> 00:02:44.066]  And sure enough, Mothers Against Drunk Driving and others are saying they want breathalyzers on all cars for everybody.
[00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:46.507]  France is already starting that.
[00:02:47.407 --> 00:02:53.089]  And the Dallas Cowboys are saying that they're mulling devices to immobilize players' cars for all of them.
[00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:59.732]  So they'll all be guilty until proven innocent.
[00:03:00.412 --> 00:03:02.493]  And this is the mode everything's going to.
[00:03:02.953 --> 00:03:04.794]  If somebody gets shot,
[00:03:06.283 --> 00:03:09.965]  Well, everyone loses their Second Amendment.
[00:03:10.005 --> 00:03:13.146]  If somebody robs a bank, well, we all go on probation.
[00:03:13.546 --> 00:03:15.627]  That's the authoritarian model.
[00:03:15.647 --> 00:03:20.690]  And of course, the actual alpha criminals on top, the king rats, are all exempt.
[00:03:24.508 --> 00:03:30.670]  So we are going to be breaking that down as well today.
[00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.351]  Also, you know, I talked about this a little bit last week.
[00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:35.772]  I need to get into it more today.
[00:03:36.092 --> 00:03:44.114]  Paul Watson is going to publish that article that he and I have been working on the last two weeks very soon at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:44.554 --> 00:03:48.136]  Mayan apocalypse panic spreads as December 21st nears.
[00:03:49.316 --> 00:03:52.477]  We're 11 days, some time zones, 10 days out.
[00:03:52.677 --> 00:03:56.299]  We put the time clock up on screen for presentplanet.tv viewers.
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:13.030]  At the end of the world, funny, every Mayan professor we've talked to, and I've been down there many times visiting the pyramids, gone to the different museums, you know, Mayans with two or three degrees all agree that there's no end of the world coming.
[00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:19.995]  Even if you believe that people that engaged in human sacrifice of their children knew everything, they didn't say that.
[00:04:20.076 --> 00:04:23.759]  So, this is a popular culture thing created since the 60s.
[00:04:23.859 --> 00:04:26.581]  It's got globalist written all over it.
[00:04:27.081 --> 00:04:30.724]  A London Telegraph, Mayan apocalypse panic spreads December 21st nears.
[00:04:31.325 --> 00:04:36.149]  Russian residents buy up tin goods and matches ahead of apocalypse.
[00:04:36.769 --> 00:04:38.851]  In fact, will you guys print me a bunch on this that I've seen?
[00:04:39.151 --> 00:04:41.954]  Like, I saw an article in the French Alps.
[00:04:42.934 --> 00:04:45.895]  People are, you know, renting their houses out for the end of the world.
[00:04:45.935 --> 00:04:46.996]  The rising water.
[00:04:47.456 --> 00:04:49.277]  And there's people on talk radio in the U.S.
[00:04:49.297 --> 00:04:51.538]  saying water will be up to the Ozarks.
[00:04:51.598 --> 00:04:55.680]  I mean, it is just asinine, literal baloney.
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.541]  We're going to break that down as well.
[00:04:57.581 --> 00:04:58.101]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.258 --> 00:05:11.923]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.

[00:06:03.518 --> 00:06:08.380]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the east, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[00:06:09.125 --> 00:06:11.908]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[00:06:12.368 --> 00:06:14.711]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:17.754]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[00:06:18.195 --> 00:06:21.238]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[00:06:21.718 --> 00:06:26.363]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoods Direct, and I recommend you do the same.
[00:06:26.924 --> 00:06:29.006]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoods Direct.
[00:06:29.566 --> 00:06:32.607]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[00:06:33.227 --> 00:06:34.848]  I'm taking control of my future.
[00:06:35.328 --> 00:06:36.969]  And you're nuts if you don't do the same.

[00:06:53.294 --> 00:06:56.416]  Would you rather prepare six months too early or one day too late?
[00:06:57.057 --> 00:07:00.920]  Oral 95633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:07:01.826 --> 00:07:10.750]  If you've ever wanted to be able to produce boiling hot water anytime, anywhere, with absolutely no power whatsoever, then this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:11.470]  Here's why.

[00:07:17.793 --> 00:07:20.634]  Introducing the Hot Water Rocket from Solutions from Science.

[00:07:50.294 --> 00:07:51.115]  The Hot Water Rocket
[00:07:51.135 --> 00:07:54.057]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the Resistance.
[00:08:22.688 --> 00:08:24.849]  It is Monday, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:30.710]  December 10th, 2012.
[00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:35.031]  Just ten days out from the end of the world.
[00:08:35.051 --> 00:08:42.173]  So says the establishment media, so says globalist propaganda since the 1960s.
[00:08:42.653 --> 00:08:46.975]  From France to Japan, from the French Alps to Texas.
[00:08:48.855 --> 00:08:52.440]  People are stocking up on food and water and preparing the end of the world.
[00:08:52.921 --> 00:08:54.423]  And they give you different reasons for it.
[00:08:54.463 --> 00:09:02.694]  They say, Planet X, Nabooru is going to slam into us, or there's going to be a meteor shower, or a comet's going to hit us, or we're going to enter the galactic nebula.
[00:09:02.814 --> 00:09:03.355]  Not true.
[00:09:04.456 --> 00:09:11.284]  Or that the galaxy's going to flip, or there's going to be a pole shift, or the sun's going to blow up.
[00:09:12.045 --> 00:09:13.787]  And none of them even debate with each other.
[00:09:13.827 --> 00:09:14.768]  They just all agree.
[00:09:14.788 --> 00:09:17.852]  And I'm getting criticized mightily, I've noticed.
[00:09:18.492 --> 00:09:22.016]  And I will be more criticized when the Earth does not blow up or we don't die.
[00:09:22.817 --> 00:09:25.920]  In ten and a half days from now, depending on which time zone, it's ten days out.
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:34.048]  In fact, can we put the big clock up, the Doomsday Clock, back on screen for people that are watching on PrisonPlanet.tv?
[00:09:34.388 --> 00:09:42.796]  It's ten days, eleven hours, fifty minutes, twenty-two seconds, until the end of the world!
[00:09:43.236 --> 00:09:47.160]  Can Superman and the Super Friends save the Earth?
[00:09:49.299 --> 00:09:56.004]  And that's Greenwich Mean Time, by the way, because everybody knows the world will end there with the British timekeepers in Greenwich.
[00:09:58.546 --> 00:10:02.009]  So, Watson and I have been writing an article over the last few weeks.
[00:10:02.089 --> 00:10:07.954]  It will be out, it will be done, Watson's proofreading it and stuff, by the third hour and I will read the article on air.
[00:10:09.435 --> 00:10:14.560]  Or the producers and folks running the cameras and systems in there, they can throw darts at me.
[00:10:15.705 --> 00:10:18.066]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, I am Alex Jones, your host.
[00:10:18.586 --> 00:10:20.647]  It is Monday, and I do want to open the phones up.
[00:10:20.667 --> 00:10:22.707]  I always say that and go to calls the last segment of the hour.
[00:10:22.727 --> 00:10:34.171]  If you want to talk about the fiscal cliff and give me your take on it, if you want to get into our government publicly now, the New York Times yesterday admitted our government's mainly using al-Qaeda as the liberators of Syria.
[00:10:34.291 --> 00:10:34.671]  You heard it.
[00:10:34.791 --> 00:10:42.154]  Our government, our military, along with NATO and others, are helping al-Qaeda overthrow a country that attacked no one in a 22-month invasion.
[00:10:43.379 --> 00:10:50.367]  Now they're talking about no-fly zone, peaceful bombing operations, because Obama's a Peace Prize winner, so when he drops bombs, it's peaceful.
[00:10:51.208 --> 00:10:51.969]  It's trendy, too.
[00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:53.511]  Very, very trendy.
[00:10:54.992 --> 00:11:01.840]  All of that's heating up with calls before the UN, you know, saying that they've got chemical weapons, so we've got to attack them.
[00:11:02.811 --> 00:11:06.313]  And the Assad regime came out and said, listen, we're not going to use it.
[00:11:06.693 --> 00:11:13.496]  The al-Qaeda jihadis have been shot on videotape, and they have, killing animals with the nerve gas they're saying they're going to use on us.
[00:11:14.016 --> 00:11:15.036]  And that's how it'll work.
[00:11:15.717 --> 00:11:19.999]  Al-Qaeda will launch chemical attacks, it'll be blamed on Syria, and they'll be leveled.
[00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:25.141]  Why would they launch a chemical attack and then give the West an excuse to attack?
[00:11:27.725 --> 00:11:29.327]  Yeah, there's the New York Times right there.
[00:11:29.367 --> 00:11:33.091]  Syrian rebels tied to Al-Qaeda play key role in war.
[00:11:33.532 --> 00:11:35.113]  We've been telling you that for over a year.
[00:11:35.574 --> 00:11:36.815]  Now it's in the New York Times.
[00:11:36.855 --> 00:11:37.876]  So it must be true!
[00:11:39.847 --> 00:11:52.670]  We told you a decade ago plus that they're putting cameras and microphones in the computers and in the Scientific Atlantic cable boxes and other things, and I showed you the patents on air and I was the crazy man.
[00:11:53.191 --> 00:11:58.012]  Now it's Associated Press, Reuters, you name it, that Google, Verizon, they're all doing it.
[00:11:58.932 --> 00:12:04.294]  I told you 16 years ago that they're listening to your phones even when your phones are off with keywords.
[00:12:04.554 --> 00:12:05.374]  It's now admitted.
[00:12:07.037 --> 00:12:18.783]  I told you the government runs Al-Qaeda against the Russians, against the Serbs, against the American people so they can take our liberty, against the Iranians, against the Libyans, against the Syrians.
[00:12:18.883 --> 00:12:21.404]  Al-Qaeda works for the globalists who run our country.
[00:12:22.833 --> 00:12:24.173]  And now that's all mainstream news.
[00:12:24.193 --> 00:12:26.194]  Do I get an apology for that?
[00:12:26.554 --> 00:12:35.456]  I told you four years ago in 2008 that they would hold us hostage over and over again with fiscal cliffs with the Secretary of the Treasury threatening Congress.
[00:12:35.676 --> 00:12:36.756]  You can pull these clips up.
[00:12:38.316 --> 00:12:39.557]  We've played them many times.
[00:12:39.597 --> 00:12:41.157]  In fact, that should be right there.
[00:12:41.197 --> 00:12:44.978]  And we had different congressmen on who first broke, they were told, in closed session.
[00:12:45.458 --> 00:12:46.518]  Martial law.
[00:12:47.138 --> 00:12:49.539]  Just type in Congress threatened with martial law.
[00:12:53.146 --> 00:12:55.827]  Over banker bailout 2008, October 3rd 2008.
[00:12:55.867 --> 00:13:06.611]  Just type that in because I'm going to show people the news headline where they can find the YouTube video of the different congressmen on this show and then no one believed it for a week and then it became mainstream news.
[00:13:07.212 --> 00:13:15.195]  See that's why the establishment puts out a meme that we're not accurate or that you know we're wrong about this and that because we're so accurate.
[00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:18.551]  I mean, it's not like it's hard to be accurate.
[00:13:18.791 --> 00:13:23.294]  We've watched this same group of mega banks do this in country after country.
[00:13:23.715 --> 00:13:24.695]  We know how they do it.
[00:13:27.137 --> 00:13:38.164]  I mean, the TSA in 2002, I was watching C-SPAN with the head of Homeland Security, Governor Ridge, who later wrote a book admitting they would put out fake terror alerts as a pretext to take liberties.
[00:13:38.785 --> 00:13:39.525]  We told you that, too.
[00:13:39.545 --> 00:13:41.386]  I mean, it's just common.
[00:13:41.406 --> 00:13:44.488]  It's like saying, I told you the sky was blue at high noon.
[00:13:44.528 --> 00:13:45.189]  I mean, it is blue.
[00:13:46.578 --> 00:13:47.518]  People are like, oh my gosh.
[00:13:49.178 --> 00:13:50.399]  They're either like, how did you know this?
[00:13:50.539 --> 00:13:51.979]  Or, oh, you were never right about anything.
[00:13:52.019 --> 00:13:53.339]  That's the meme that's put out.
[00:13:54.039 --> 00:14:00.261]  We told you that the TSA would be on the highways and the train stations and the bus stations because they said that was their plan.
[00:14:00.521 --> 00:14:07.222]  They said you'll have to get an authorization from them to own a gun, to travel, to get on a plane or leave the country.
[00:14:08.202 --> 00:14:09.942]  That's all now being announced.
[00:14:09.962 --> 00:14:12.523]  That's exactly what every authoritarian system
[00:14:13.683 --> 00:14:27.114]  From ancient Rome, to Pol Pot's Cambodia, to Stalin's Russia, to Hitler's Germany, to Cuba's Fidel Castro.
[00:14:27.154 --> 00:14:28.335]  I mean, this is standard.
[00:14:29.115 --> 00:14:30.136]  This is standard.
[00:14:30.597 --> 00:14:37.022]  Black uniforms, surveillance, citizen spies, intimidation of people for their speech.
[00:14:37.062 --> 00:14:39.504]  I mean, we're following an exact script.
[00:14:41.656 --> 00:14:43.977]  It's not rocket science.
[00:14:46.159 --> 00:14:50.621]  And we're going down this road, and they've done this four times the last four years in Europe.
[00:14:51.161 --> 00:14:52.562]  They've done it several times here.
[00:14:54.283 --> 00:14:57.805]  Oh, if we don't give, you know, tens of billions of dollars to General Motors, it'll go bankrupt.
[00:14:57.825 --> 00:15:01.267]  And then they pay to move them to China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil.
[00:15:02.518 --> 00:15:05.124]  Oh, if you don't give us $874 billion, we'll go bankrupt.
[00:15:05.144 --> 00:15:13.202]  It was actually just an open window shining us on to the $644 trillion of domestic derivatives fraud created by the six megabanks.
[00:15:16.892 --> 00:15:18.633]  Yeah, there's Representative Burgess.
[00:15:18.693 --> 00:15:21.636]  Congress under martial law to pass banker bailout.
[00:15:22.016 --> 00:15:22.997]  The Daily Newscaster.
[00:15:23.317 --> 00:15:24.538]  That's another congressman.
[00:15:25.018 --> 00:15:27.080]  I want to find our interviews with the congressman.
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.241]  If you just type in, you guys found one of them.
[00:15:30.062 --> 00:15:33.144]  If you type in, Congress was threatened with martial law.
[00:15:34.966 --> 00:15:35.886]  That'll just pull it up.
[00:15:36.907 --> 00:15:40.410]  Because they also have a term, they call martial law when the committee chairs take control.
[00:15:42.134 --> 00:15:44.196]  But that was a separate issue, but that was the right story.
[00:15:44.236 --> 00:15:46.797]  The point is, people forget about all this.
[00:15:47.217 --> 00:15:54.801]  They were threatened with blood in the street, tanks in the streets, total collapse, 10,000 point stock market drop, if they didn't give them a blank check.
[00:15:55.001 --> 00:15:56.802]  Europe's gone through this four times now.
[00:15:57.943 --> 00:16:07.248]  And now they're saying, give us 1.6 trillion in tax increases, 1.2 trillion in total wipeout of all deductions,
[00:16:09.378 --> 00:16:15.960]  And the 3.8 surcharge on basically all investments, stock market investments, everything based on that.
[00:16:16.661 --> 00:16:17.701]  And a bunch of other taxes.
[00:16:17.721 --> 00:16:20.702]  And the Republicans are like, no, only $990 billion increase.
[00:16:21.182 --> 00:16:28.384]  And $400 to $600 billion in wiping out almost all, but not all, but most of the tax exemptions.
[00:16:28.925 --> 00:16:29.565]  On and on and on.
[00:16:29.925 --> 00:16:32.046]  And yeah, we'll go on with everything else you want.
[00:16:32.426 --> 00:16:35.987]  And we'll even give the President the power to automatically increase the debt limit.
[00:16:36.507 --> 00:16:38.288]  I mean, that's martial law.
[00:16:39.264 --> 00:16:41.426]  Over the power of the purse.
[00:16:41.466 --> 00:16:45.849]  Let me tell you, if a president can just raise the debt limit whenever he wants, he can destroy you.
[00:16:46.149 --> 00:16:55.376]  Democratic Congress representatives were threatened with martial law in America over bailout Steve Watson, October 3rd, 2008.
[00:16:57.357 --> 00:16:57.918]  Steve Watson.
[00:16:57.938 --> 00:16:59.639]  See, I even told you the date, didn't I, folks?
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:05.784]  And you scroll down, scroll down in Steve Watson's Infowars.com article, because it will have the YouTube video.
[00:17:06.204 --> 00:17:06.624]  You see there?
[00:17:06.644 --> 00:17:07.305]  That's what I was looking for.
[00:17:07.992 --> 00:17:11.834]  Fear-mongering exposed by Congressman Sherman on C-SPAN.
[00:17:12.054 --> 00:17:13.575]  Guys, go ahead and grab that video again.
[00:17:14.856 --> 00:17:16.417]  It's only 45 juicy seconds.
[00:17:18.478 --> 00:17:21.700]  And we will play that here for people.
[00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:22.320]  See, I told you.
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:23.281]  October 3rd, 2008.
[00:17:24.621 --> 00:17:25.362]  And I'm not smart.
[00:17:26.621 --> 00:17:27.162]  I'm average.
[00:17:27.222 --> 00:17:50.762]  See, I don't know, do you remember Super Bowl II, when everything froze and such and such, through from the 27-yard line, directly in, and with his frozen, bleeding hands, the wide receiver, blah, blah, caught it, and then, and it was such a celebration, and then, and then, and then Jimmy the Greek said, see, you can do that too.
[00:17:51.522 --> 00:17:53.905]  I've just decided to actually take those skills,
[00:17:55.322 --> 00:17:56.102]  I hear men all day.
[00:17:56.362 --> 00:17:57.523]  Yeah, I follow this team.
[00:17:57.543 --> 00:17:58.623]  Yeah, they've got a new pitcher.
[00:17:59.024 --> 00:18:11.229]  Yeah, he grew up in this town, and his favorite team was this, and yeah, he pitched this his first year as a freshman, and they're telling you this like they're impressing you.
[00:18:11.449 --> 00:18:13.290]  Because guys do this to show off to each other.
[00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:17.572]  And I'll be going, you know, you ought to put that to work in business.
[00:18:19.258 --> 00:18:22.000]  Of course, you probably don't actually like being successful, do you?
[00:18:22.761 --> 00:18:24.142]  Actually taking care of your family.
[00:18:24.903 --> 00:18:28.706]  You just want to sit there and try to impress me with your sports statistics.
[00:18:29.026 --> 00:18:32.169]  I mean, these full-grown men talk about fantasy football all day.
[00:18:32.509 --> 00:18:36.152]  Anywhere I go, even if they're listeners, they'll start asking me about football and stuff.
[00:18:36.392 --> 00:18:37.213]  And I go, hey, listen.
[00:18:39.304 --> 00:18:49.184]  Did you know that thousands of foods have several thousand times, I have a report out on it today, of what they admit causes massive brain damage of sodium fluoride in them?
[00:18:50.302 --> 00:18:55.545]  Powdered eggs, additives in bread, the toothpaste out there.
[00:18:55.925 --> 00:19:10.434]  There's one Colgate with 5,000 times, I'm gonna go over this, a 1.3 part per million that'll give you on average a 10 point IQ reduction, reduce about 15 to 20 years off your life, and massively dumb you down.
[00:19:11.638 --> 00:19:12.919]  By the way, that's a Harvard study.
[00:19:12.939 --> 00:19:14.380]  I'm going to be getting back to that in a moment.
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:19.522]  See, they know that they're killing us.
[00:19:19.542 --> 00:19:28.748]  And I understand you were in a fog, and you were taught since the time you were a child that it's manly to know sports statistics.
[00:19:28.788 --> 00:19:35.351]  Listen, if everything was okay, sports might be okay to be obsessed with, but then you just get taken over by corruption again.
[00:19:35.752 --> 00:19:39.554]  You better learn about this, because with the fiscal cliff,
[00:19:40.598 --> 00:19:44.800]  They're going to put in taxes to shut the... They know, people are like, this will shut the country down.
[00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.381]  Businesses are closing everywhere.
[00:19:46.601 --> 00:19:47.261]  That's the plan.
[00:19:47.981 --> 00:19:49.862]  Oh my gosh, the country will go even more bankrupt.
[00:19:50.062 --> 00:19:51.643]  It'll make less tax receipts come in.
[00:19:51.803 --> 00:19:52.503]  That's the plan.
[00:19:53.444 --> 00:19:54.164]  That's the plan.
[00:19:54.244 --> 00:19:57.126]  They're putting the ship on the rocks so they can then wreck it.
[00:19:57.466 --> 00:19:58.486]  So they can then loot it.
[00:19:58.886 --> 00:20:00.127]  You know what wreckers are?
[00:20:00.467 --> 00:20:01.648]  They're called salvagers.
[00:20:01.928 --> 00:20:02.408]  Scavengers.
[00:20:03.749 --> 00:20:08.531]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[00:20:09.261 --> 00:20:11.982]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[00:20:12.422 --> 00:20:14.763]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[00:20:15.203 --> 00:20:17.704]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[00:20:18.144 --> 00:20:21.145]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[00:20:21.605 --> 00:20:26.186]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:28.847]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.

[00:20:32.948 --> 00:20:34.549]  I'm taking control of my future.
[00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:36.629]  And you're nuts if you don't do the same.

[00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:41.131]  This capitalism?
[00:22:41.191 --> 00:22:47.335]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:22:47.455 --> 00:22:48.276]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:22:48.336 --> 00:22:51.438]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[00:23:02.665 --> 00:23:04.245]  Time and time again.

[00:23:07.207 --> 00:23:08.287]  We need assistance.
[00:23:08.647 --> 00:23:09.188]  Please!
[00:23:09.468 --> 00:23:12.769]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[00:23:13.049 --> 00:23:16.411]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way.
[00:23:16.731 --> 00:23:19.192]  While the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[00:23:19.452 --> 00:23:21.773]  Don't depend on the government to save you.
[00:23:21.973 --> 00:23:22.954]  Take action now.
[00:23:23.254 --> 00:23:24.875]  We are hurting down here and we need help.
[00:23:48.254 --> 00:23:49.054]  Immediately!
[00:23:49.114 --> 00:23:53.535]  Before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare.
[00:23:53.895 --> 00:24:06.337]  MyPatriotSupply.com MyPatriotSupply.com Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun!
[00:24:15.461 --> 00:24:20.526]  Should have seen what was going on during the break.
[00:24:33.852 --> 00:24:34.492]  Oh, okay.
[00:24:35.132 --> 00:24:36.713]  I'm high on life, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:37.313 --> 00:24:42.854]  And there's a lot of adversity out there, but I do have what I'd call gallows humor sometimes.
[00:24:42.874 --> 00:24:43.674]  I have a little bit of fun.
[00:24:44.135 --> 00:24:44.615]  Excuse me.
[00:24:45.395 --> 00:24:48.256]  Look, we are in a lot of trouble here with this staged fiscal cliff.
[00:24:48.996 --> 00:25:01.939]  And if we could just get the public to not know who all the sitcom stars are and not know who all the football players were and actually know how government worked, people would wake up to how the scam is operating.
[00:25:02.759 --> 00:25:19.817]  And realize, we are being delivered into an authoritarian, anti-liberty system, where the power structure, the megabanks, can choose the winners and the losers, and where things are actuaried out to phase out private wealth that is not in the hands of globalists, as a tool of total control.
[00:25:20.498 --> 00:25:22.519]  We are going into a scientific dictatorship.
[00:25:22.539 --> 00:25:28.341]  That's why you have all the secret and then declassified chemical, biological, radiological testing on the American people.
[00:25:28.682 --> 00:25:33.524]  That's why you have the medical tyranny model of forced inoculations they're trying to force in worldwide.
[00:25:34.944 --> 00:25:40.507]  That's why you see healthcare now codified and controlled by federal law, saying what healthcare you will get.
[00:25:42.495 --> 00:25:43.055]  It's happening.
[00:25:43.115 --> 00:25:47.938]  The states all over are saying, we're going to inject your kids without consent at the school and not tell you.
[00:25:48.218 --> 00:25:50.319]  We're going to take your 10-year-old for an abortion.
[00:25:51.379 --> 00:25:54.400]  Never mind your kids are going into puberty at age 8 when they should be going into it at 14.
[00:25:55.261 --> 00:25:56.541]  Never mind why that's happening.
[00:25:56.581 --> 00:25:57.542]  Let's just move forward.
[00:25:58.042 --> 00:25:59.363]  We're under attack.
[00:25:59.563 --> 00:26:00.703]  You're under attack.
[00:26:01.144 --> 00:26:06.806]  And you can have the mental strength to understand that, yeah, what I talk about is scary, but I'm not trying to scare you.
[00:26:06.826 --> 00:26:07.967]  I'm trying to get you moving.
[00:26:09.347 --> 00:26:10.388]  If your house was burning,
[00:26:11.576 --> 00:26:15.239]  And I came and banged on the door, your neighbor did, and said, get up, Bob, your house is burning.
[00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:19.383]  You wouldn't come to the door coughing and say, don't fear monger, Bill.
[00:26:20.224 --> 00:26:20.945]  I'm not Bob.
[00:26:21.225 --> 00:26:22.046]  Your house is on fire.
[00:26:22.466 --> 00:26:25.149]  Why are you in there laying in the bed while your house is about to collapse?
[00:26:25.409 --> 00:26:27.210]  Well, I'm just thinking positively.
[00:26:28.031 --> 00:26:29.473]  And I'm not going to be negative.
[00:26:30.413 --> 00:26:35.078]  Positive is assessing the real situation and making a preparation for it.
[00:26:35.817 --> 00:26:38.058]  And we are going to hell in a handbasket.
[00:26:38.298 --> 00:26:52.564]  The reason the public is so decadent and so dumb down in the West, the reason we're living less, the reason we're so unhealthy, the reason we lead the world in the West, now in diabetes, cancer and other diseases, every one of them, is because we're being murdered.
[00:26:53.666 --> 00:26:59.048]  They kill us with soft kill to extract the money out of us while we slowly die.
[00:26:59.389 --> 00:27:04.171]  In the third world, they just inject them with live polio and HIV and get caught.
[00:27:04.571 --> 00:27:06.692]  And no one gets in trouble for it.
[00:27:07.332 --> 00:27:11.854]  So, this is the type of garbage that we're dealing with.
[00:27:11.974 --> 00:27:13.295]  And when I get up here,
[00:27:14.338 --> 00:27:25.146]  And I tell you in 2008, this is the model, here's the IMF, here's the World Bank bragging, in their own documents that were released in 2002, how they were next going to implode Europe and the U.S.
[00:27:25.346 --> 00:27:28.068]  That's in my book, Dissent into Tyranny.
[00:27:29.609 --> 00:27:38.455]  When Joseph Stiklitz left the World Bank as their chief economist, Nobel Prize winner, he says he didn't release the documents, okay, but the BBC got 2,000 plus pages of them.
[00:27:40.336 --> 00:27:42.518]  And we were able to release them first with
[00:27:44.127 --> 00:27:45.675]  Greg Pallast here on this broadcast.
[00:27:45.716 --> 00:27:47.223]  BBC only let him put out some of it.
[00:27:47.264 --> 00:27:48.249]  He put out even more here.
[00:27:50.539 --> 00:27:54.741]  And we said within 10 years they will implode Europe and the U.S.
[00:27:55.041 --> 00:27:56.402]  the same way they do the third world.
[00:27:56.622 --> 00:27:59.783]  And there is a 112-point plan how they do it.
[00:27:59.843 --> 00:28:02.604]  You might want to go read the 112-point IMF plan.
[00:28:02.644 --> 00:28:04.585]  I mean, just, it's the future of the world.
[00:28:04.805 --> 00:28:06.346]  I mean, you might want to know that for business.
[00:28:06.526 --> 00:28:10.427]  Let's say you're some greedy, self-serving, New World Order person who's mid-level.
[00:28:10.647 --> 00:28:14.429]  You might actually want to know what's really going on and get outside the compartmentalization.
[00:28:14.869 --> 00:28:16.830]  That's where real power comes from.
[00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:17.870]  It's all there.
[00:28:18.071 --> 00:28:21.633]  They operate like you don't have an IQ, and so it's all public.
[00:28:22.053 --> 00:28:32.679]  Let's go to break with this clip of Congressman Sherman, who first said this on my show a day before, and then people didn't believe it, so he went out on TV.
[00:28:33.888 --> 00:28:37.051]  The only way they can pass this bill is by creating and sustaining a panic atmosphere.
[00:28:37.091 --> 00:28:39.113]  That atmosphere is not justified.
[00:28:56.891 --> 00:29:16.710]  Many of us were told in private conversations that if we voted against this bill on Monday, that the sky would fall, the market would drop two or three thousand points the first day, another couple thousand the second day, and a few members were even told that there would be martial law in America if we voted no.
[00:29:17.931 --> 00:29:19.592]  That's what I call fear-mongering.
[00:29:20.372 --> 00:29:21.233]  Unjustified.
[00:29:21.713 --> 00:29:22.453]  Proven wrong.
[00:29:23.094 --> 00:29:23.874]  We've got a week.
[00:29:24.214 --> 00:29:26.235]  We've got two weeks to write a good bill.
[00:29:26.315 --> 00:29:27.436]  That's good.
[00:29:27.816 --> 00:29:33.498]  And by the way, I had other congressmen on breaking this at the time, and people thought I had fake congressmen on.
[00:29:33.518 --> 00:29:34.899]  Okay?
[00:29:35.619 --> 00:29:37.960]  Just like when I told you the NSA spawned on you without warrants.
[00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:38.761]  Oh, that can't be true.
[00:29:38.821 --> 00:29:41.242]  And I had whistleblowers on over a decade ago.
[00:29:42.042 --> 00:29:42.943]  Now it's all admitted.
[00:29:43.163 --> 00:29:44.223]  Folks, this is real.
[00:29:44.583 --> 00:29:44.783]  Okay?
[00:29:44.803 --> 00:29:45.404]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:45.424 --> 00:29:45.804]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.294 --> 00:29:54.317]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.218 --> 00:30:02.546]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.366 --> 00:30:09.192]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[00:30:10.111 --> 00:30:15.996]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.

[00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:49.292]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[00:31:12.562 --> 00:31:15.825]  When you're sleeping, who's watching out for intruders and spooks?
[00:31:16.525 --> 00:31:17.606]  Check out SimpliSafe.

[00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:46.365]  SimpliSafe is also ridiculously easy to install yourself in under 20 minutes, so there's no need to let a stranger into your home.
[00:31:46.905 --> 00:31:47.306]  I think so.
[00:32:02.119 --> 00:32:11.042]  If you've ever wanted to be able to produce boiling hot water anytime, anywhere, with absolutely no power whatsoever, then this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[00:32:11.122 --> 00:32:11.763]  Here's why.
[00:32:11.803 --> 00:32:17.925]  There's a brand new self-reliance product available that makes producing piping hot water in any emergency fast and easy.
[00:32:18.085 --> 00:32:20.906]  Introducing the Hot Water Rocket from Solutions from Science.
[00:32:21.186 --> 00:32:21.607]  We're good.
[00:32:36.428 --> 00:32:36.728]  We're good.
[00:33:03.573 --> 00:33:07.576]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:33:08.356 --> 00:33:09.837]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:10.078 --> 00:33:11.298]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:11.739 --> 00:33:16.862]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:17.183 --> 00:33:29.932]  Alex Jones here back live, my friends.
[00:33:31.738 --> 00:33:46.951]  By the way, last week, and I've got Kirk reposting it at Infowars.com, he wrote an article about Jamie Foxx and the new movie coming out where he basically goes around killing white people because they're all racist and bad.
[00:33:48.552 --> 00:33:51.395]  And this is all part of the divide and conquer dehumanization.
[00:33:52.275 --> 00:33:54.457]  But it's also part of the double set of standards.
[00:33:54.798 --> 00:33:56.039]  That's what I said about Machete.
[00:33:57.128 --> 00:34:04.934]  When I got the script from concerned people on the production crew, and part of it was cut, but it was still a call for race war.
[00:34:07.316 --> 00:34:08.016]  It's amazing.
[00:34:08.136 --> 00:34:10.658]  And if you go to DrudgeReport.com, they've got the video linked.
[00:34:10.698 --> 00:34:12.600]  We're also getting it up at Infowars.com.
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:17.143]  Jamie Foxx jokes about killing all the white people in his new movie.
[00:34:18.864 --> 00:34:20.586]  He says, I kill all the white people in the movie.
[00:34:20.626 --> 00:34:21.506]  How great is that?
[00:34:21.646 --> 00:34:26.230]  To thunderous applause from the video transcript of Saturday Night Live.
[00:34:27.981 --> 00:34:29.062]  We're going to play that coming up.
[00:34:31.543 --> 00:34:37.627]  And, of course, he said last week that Obama is our Lord and Savior and that we should pray to him.
[00:34:38.568 --> 00:34:46.093]  And this is all done to generate publicity and it's allowed by the power structure to create division.
[00:34:46.153 --> 00:34:47.034]  In fact, the senator
[00:34:48.055 --> 00:34:49.097]  From West Virginia.
[00:34:49.137 --> 00:34:50.399]  I had this in the stack yesterday.
[00:34:50.419 --> 00:34:51.241]  Well, you guys dig that.
[00:34:51.601 --> 00:34:52.383]  I never got to it.
[00:34:53.044 --> 00:34:58.093]  Talked about these MTV shows where they go find the poorest, most degenerate, pathetic...
[00:35:00.302 --> 00:35:04.765]  Uh, drugged out Appalachian folks, and then put it out there.
[00:35:04.805 --> 00:35:08.949]  But they would never do this with people in the Hispanic or black community.
[00:35:09.429 --> 00:35:13.793]  And again, it's meant to sell that image that whites are absolute trash and garbage.
[00:35:14.213 --> 00:35:15.114]  And it's culture war.
[00:35:15.654 --> 00:35:23.281]  On the other end, MTV, and I've talked to multiple high-level people that were inside MTV in the mid-90s, they said, we're gonna push this gangster rap.
[00:35:24.178 --> 00:35:27.801]  And we're going to push stuff like Marilyn Manson to destroy the white kids.
[00:35:27.821 --> 00:35:33.044]  We're going to push this gangster rap to just absolutely destroy the black kids.
[00:35:34.345 --> 00:35:35.706]  I've talked to multiple sources.
[00:35:36.487 --> 00:35:43.192]  This is Joe Manchin objects to MTV's Buckwild reality show.
[00:35:45.113 --> 00:35:48.135]  And it goes on to say, as a U.S.
[00:35:48.155 --> 00:35:49.796]  Senator, I am repulsed at the
[00:35:50.905 --> 00:35:55.868]  Business venture where some Americans are making money off the poor decisions of the youth.
[00:35:56.369 --> 00:36:02.873]  Manchin wrote, I cannot imagine that anyone who loves this country would feel proud profiting off of Buckwild.
[00:36:04.074 --> 00:36:10.899]  Instead of showcasing the beauty of our people in our state, you preyed on young people, coaxed them into displaying shameful behavior.
[00:36:11.279 --> 00:36:12.860]  Oh folks, I've been around these reality shows.
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:14.381]  I've talked to countless people that were involved in them.
[00:36:15.122 --> 00:36:16.783]  And they try to get you to do bad things.
[00:36:17.524 --> 00:36:19.145]  They try to get you to do bad things.
[00:36:20.566 --> 00:36:22.087]  And now you are profiting from it.
[00:36:22.847 --> 00:36:23.848]  That is just wrong.
[00:36:24.969 --> 00:36:26.049]  That's why I'm not stupid enough.
[00:36:26.349 --> 00:36:33.834]  I've no exaggeration turned down 10 offers five or six times with contracts on the table for massive amounts of money.
[00:36:34.334 --> 00:36:38.116]  And I've said, no, you really don't want to have your big show.
[00:36:38.156 --> 00:36:40.017]  You'll be a, but I'm like, no, I know what you're going to do.
[00:36:41.678 --> 00:36:42.379]  I know what you're going to do.
[00:36:44.164 --> 00:36:47.426]  Like, well, we are going to have to have access to your family, and you are going to have to have some drama.
[00:36:47.826 --> 00:36:48.547]  It ain't happening.
[00:36:48.787 --> 00:36:49.628]  There's no drama.
[00:36:50.008 --> 00:36:50.468]  I work.
[00:36:51.429 --> 00:36:53.290]  I work about 15, 16 hours a day.
[00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:58.173]  I read to my kids and play with, you know, toys on the wood floor.
[00:36:59.174 --> 00:37:00.355]  I walk around on my property.
[00:37:00.375 --> 00:37:01.716]  There was some excitement yesterday.
[00:37:01.736 --> 00:37:08.240]  A Labrador ran into a raccoon, and there was a fight ensued, and the lab killed it.
[00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:09.701]  I actually have video of it.
[00:37:09.741 --> 00:37:10.902]  It was a pretty powerful video.
[00:37:11.994 --> 00:37:13.615]  And I'm debating whether I should air it.
[00:37:13.655 --> 00:37:14.215]  But you watch.
[00:37:14.515 --> 00:37:16.696]  If National Geographic aired it, it would be oh great.
[00:37:17.016 --> 00:37:17.776]  Or all these other shows.
[00:37:17.796 --> 00:37:19.937]  But if I did, it would be terrible to show it.
[00:37:20.797 --> 00:37:21.497]  Absolutely.
[00:37:21.637 --> 00:37:23.918]  Plus, I had to get out in the swamp.
[00:37:24.318 --> 00:37:25.398]  There's a swamp near my house.
[00:37:25.779 --> 00:37:29.700]  I had to wade across it, up to my neck, holding the phone up, then got there.
[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:30.560]  The phone was full.
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:32.001]  I got to dump everything off my phone, guys.
[00:37:32.041 --> 00:37:32.381]  Remind me.
[00:37:32.741 --> 00:37:35.302]  Then I had to erase some stuff so I could tape the aftermath of it.
[00:37:35.342 --> 00:37:37.843]  But it was still... Anyway, side issue.
[00:37:40.751 --> 00:37:48.216]  Instead of showcasing the beauty of our people and our state, you preyed on young people, coaxed them into displaying shameful behavior, and now you are profiting from it.
[00:37:48.536 --> 00:37:49.177]  That is just wrong.
[00:37:49.197 --> 00:37:51.878]  Yeah, it's like honey, boo-boo, and all this stuff.
[00:37:52.659 --> 00:37:54.640]  And that is what America's been turned into.
[00:37:55.521 --> 00:38:02.906]  But, you know, I could go do a reality show in East Austin and go in and show people things that are just ungodly.
[00:38:02.926 --> 00:38:04.187]  Instead, I try to help those people.
[00:38:04.507 --> 00:38:05.828]  I could go show poor black people.
[00:38:06.977 --> 00:38:09.519]  And, but, oh, no, no, no, that wouldn't be politically correct.
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:12.502]  See, plus, they've already got them where they want them on average.
[00:38:12.742 --> 00:38:14.163]  Ruined, wrecked, destroyed.
[00:38:14.583 --> 00:38:17.706]  They don't want that to be known about, what government creates.
[00:38:18.266 --> 00:38:23.731]  They want to show you instead what government has created with the archetypal Appalachian hillbilly.
[00:38:25.812 --> 00:38:27.594]  And it is so unbelievably sad.
[00:38:27.614 --> 00:38:29.795]  And this is the new, you know, these are the top shows now.
[00:38:30.676 --> 00:38:31.797]  And it's a feedback loop.
[00:38:32.117 --> 00:38:34.940]  And the Globalist, Sumner, Redstone and others are celebrating
[00:38:36.004 --> 00:38:36.544]  What they've done.
[00:38:38.005 --> 00:38:39.466]  So there is that report.
[00:38:39.786 --> 00:38:46.510]  Speaking of that, do we have the video yet of... We're capturing it, okay.
[00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:48.551]  We're gonna play that video coming up.
[00:38:48.791 --> 00:38:53.854]  I want to give the number out and take some of your calls ahead of Jesse Ventura popping in, then we'll continue with calls and a ton of news.
[00:38:54.214 --> 00:38:55.375]  Toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:38:55.395 --> 00:38:55.435]  800-259-9231.
[00:38:55.475 --> 00:38:56.935]  First-time callers yet again.
[00:39:04.161 --> 00:39:06.823]  By the way, I made the point yesterday.
[00:39:06.883 --> 00:39:23.454]  I said, how long until Bob Costas, who blames guns for people's violent actions in the NFL, how long until Bob Costas blames cars and everyone else for NFL players up in Dallas, Dallas Cowboys?
[00:39:24.841 --> 00:39:32.706]  Calvin Hicks driving now charged with manslaughter with a vehicle and one of the starting linemen was really cool.
[00:39:32.746 --> 00:39:34.427]  I'd say, you know, nose guard.
[00:39:34.467 --> 00:39:37.529]  I'd know all the facts about it and be really manly, but I'm not.
[00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:44.894]  Jerry Brown got killed when the vehicle rolled over when they were driving around from a private club.
[00:39:45.134 --> 00:39:45.755]  Now they're going to go
[00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:48.091]  Indict and charge.
[00:39:48.111 --> 00:39:51.253]  They're over there right now, the private club they were at, as if they didn't get liquored up and go over there.
[00:39:51.413 --> 00:39:53.014]  Now they want breathalyzers in the clubs.
[00:39:53.314 --> 00:39:54.515]  It's a total surveillance grid.
[00:39:54.755 --> 00:39:58.657]  Even though distracted driving, they estimate that even the government does five times the deaths.
[00:40:00.378 --> 00:40:02.960]  Most of their answer is arrest you if you're eating a hot dog while you're driving.
[00:40:04.571 --> 00:40:06.874]  So see, oh, we've got to have cameras in the cars surveilling you.
[00:40:06.935 --> 00:40:09.618]  Oh, we just so happen to come out with these AI computers to do it.
[00:40:09.899 --> 00:40:12.563]  Told you that over a decade ago, because Toyota said they were going to do that in the future.
[00:40:12.843 --> 00:40:18.852]  And now France is passing a law where all cars have breathalyzers hooked into a cell phone reporting back to the police.
[00:40:20.144 --> 00:40:21.105]  So, guess what happened?
[00:40:21.265 --> 00:40:25.807]  They've been calling for a long time for all cars to have breathalyzers and a little surveillance suite you pay for.
[00:40:26.808 --> 00:40:28.109]  On-star, basically mandatory.
[00:40:28.129 --> 00:40:28.889]  We were being surveilled.
[00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:32.491]  Cowboys mulled device to immobilize players' cars.
[00:40:33.692 --> 00:40:43.538]  Calvin Hill asked himself the question repeatedly in his role as a consultant for the Dallas Cowboys with responsibility of administering off-the-field support programs.
[00:40:44.258 --> 00:40:45.159]  And it wasn't Calvin Hill.
[00:40:45.239 --> 00:40:46.299]  That's one of the other names.
[00:40:46.319 --> 00:40:47.080]  I don't even know all the names.
[00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:47.380]  Excuse me.
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:48.501]  I had a big stack.
[00:40:48.541 --> 00:40:49.521]  That's not the guy charged.
[00:40:49.541 --> 00:40:50.782]  That was the guy running the program.
[00:40:50.862 --> 00:40:51.603]  That was a mistake.
[00:40:52.203 --> 00:41:04.591]  He is searching for the answers in the wake of the single-car alcohol-related crash early Saturday that killed practice squad linebacker Jerry Brown and left defensive tackle Josh Brent.
[00:41:04.631 --> 00:41:06.092]  Josh Brent's the one that's getting charged.
[00:41:06.632 --> 00:41:09.494]  Facing intoxication manslaughter charges.
[00:41:10.214 --> 00:41:18.957]  Obviously, we do whatever we can, Gil said soberly before Sunday's game at Paul Brown Stadium, alluding to the team's educational programs.
[00:41:19.598 --> 00:41:29.041]  But now they're calling for having the NFL Team Association push to have breathalyzers in all the vehicles.
[00:41:31.082 --> 00:41:33.163]  And of course, Matt is involved in the whole program.
[00:41:34.346 --> 00:41:36.828]  So that's what's going on here.
[00:41:37.629 --> 00:41:59.747]  And it's just incredible that you've got Josh Brent now being charged with intoxication manslaughter, and Jerry Brown dead, and Calvin Hill, who's been a consultant trying to stop all this drunk driving and all this stuff, is asking himself, when is this going to end?
[00:42:00.848 --> 00:42:01.889]  You know, what more can we do?
[00:42:03.652 --> 00:42:05.573]  And then now they're talking about MAD.
[00:42:06.873 --> 00:42:09.394]  Having, you know, having them basically oversee things.
[00:42:11.494 --> 00:42:12.994]  Having breathalyzers put in the cars.
[00:42:13.014 --> 00:42:14.075]  And that's USA Today.
[00:42:14.635 --> 00:42:17.196]  Cowboys mold device to immobilize players' cars.
[00:42:18.616 --> 00:42:20.697]  So, guilty until proven innocent.
[00:42:21.177 --> 00:42:22.777]  Making you blow into things.
[00:42:26.158 --> 00:42:27.238]  Before you can drive.
[00:42:27.358 --> 00:42:29.859]  Everyone guilty until proven innocent.
[00:42:31.377 --> 00:42:38.542]  This is the type of system they're pushing, and that's exactly the thing that Bob Costas is calling for.
[00:42:38.562 --> 00:42:40.823]  You know, you can't trust men, remember his quote?
[00:42:42.344 --> 00:42:43.765]  Remember his quote on the O'Reilly factory?
[00:42:43.785 --> 00:42:46.847]  He said, you can't trust men 20 to 30, I stand by that, to own guns.
[00:42:48.068 --> 00:42:48.969]  You just can't trust them.
[00:42:48.989 --> 00:42:52.011]  You can't trust these guys to drive cars without breathalyzers on them.
[00:42:52.391 --> 00:42:59.676]  As society degenerates because of the dumbing down, the fluoride, the water, the poisoning, the chemicals, the GMO,
[00:43:01.069 --> 00:43:10.757]  The system's gonna say, well, all of you basically have to live in a prison now and be under 24-hour surveillance that the government's gonna run when it's run by the foreign banks that are carrying out this eugenics.
[00:43:11.118 --> 00:43:13.059]  And next, let me show you this, then I'm going to your phone calls.
[00:43:14.581 --> 00:43:15.882]  Here's a story from last week.
[00:43:17.063 --> 00:43:18.884]  Steve Watson, InfoWars.com.
[00:43:18.944 --> 00:43:26.751]  Verizon follows Google in turning phones and TVs into... Document cam's right here.
[00:43:26.791 --> 00:43:27.912]  It's pointed right at the right spot.
[00:43:27.952 --> 00:43:28.593]  Thank you, right there.
[00:43:29.837 --> 00:43:35.299]  Verizon follows Google into turning phones and TVs into wiretaps.
[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:42.242]  And it goes on, InfoWars first broke the story on invasive spying six years ago.
[00:43:42.262 --> 00:43:46.804]  And again, not tooting our horn, but we got attacked viciously.
[00:43:49.185 --> 00:43:58.929]  We got attacked savagely as liars when we had a link in the story to Google's own press release to shareholders.
[00:44:01.485 --> 00:44:03.487]  September 6th, 2006.
[00:44:04.028 --> 00:44:04.748]  Seven years ago.
[00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:06.150]  Six years ago.
[00:44:07.471 --> 00:44:09.473]  We got, we got attacked.
[00:44:12.793 --> 00:44:20.657]  Because there's no way Google put out a patent and admitted they had AI listening to you, and they talked about, if your dog barked, they'd put dog food ads up.
[00:44:20.917 --> 00:44:23.078]  That was the same headline last week in the Daily Mail.
[00:44:23.639 --> 00:44:24.199]  Six years later.
[00:44:24.819 --> 00:44:26.780]  What we talked about, what we broke down.
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.621]  Again, I'm just pointing out, this stuff's coming true.
[00:44:29.361 --> 00:44:30.822]  And then here's the new articles on it.
[00:44:31.463 --> 00:44:33.764]  Verizon's creepy spy cam idea.
[00:44:33.984 --> 00:44:39.126]  To watch and listen to you, and if you're sitting there with your husband, they give you a condom ad.
[00:44:39.287 --> 00:44:40.007]  Is this what they say?
[00:44:41.235 --> 00:44:42.817]  But it's okay, only the computer's watching you.
[00:44:42.837 --> 00:44:43.298]  Yeah, right.
[00:44:43.638 --> 00:44:44.759]  And recording it all.
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:46.201]  This is already going on.
[00:44:46.221 --> 00:44:50.126]  Remember four years ago it came out in California and in Pennsylvania?
[00:44:50.366 --> 00:44:51.668]  The schools were watching people?
[00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:57.951]  Folks, this is the new computers coming out in the Mercedes and the Toyotas and the Lexuses.
[00:44:58.192 --> 00:45:02.713]  It's like, oh, your car watches you and tracks what you do in the new Lexus.
[00:45:03.213 --> 00:45:09.535]  Because I saw the ad on TV, and I meant to do a piece on this a few weeks ago, and if you're not driving right, it takes control for you.
[00:45:09.575 --> 00:45:11.655]  See, we are one inch from robot cars.
[00:45:11.675 --> 00:45:13.136]  They're already on the streets all over the country.
[00:45:13.576 --> 00:45:16.278]  And then they're saying the robot cars are safer, now they're gonna drive.
[00:45:16.498 --> 00:45:20.861]  You can feel like you're driving with the robots in control, and it's all hooked into the police department.
[00:45:21.101 --> 00:45:21.861]  That's being announced.
[00:45:21.961 --> 00:45:24.543]  Beyond 25 light years ahead of 1984.
[00:45:27.665 --> 00:45:32.748]  Here it is, Daily Mail, the TV box that can detect when you're cuddling on the sofa and show you an advert for condoms.
[00:45:34.622 --> 00:45:34.922]  Boom!
[00:45:35.242 --> 00:45:36.363]  Told you that six years ago.
[00:45:36.563 --> 00:45:38.284]  That other headline's about your dog barks.
[00:45:38.684 --> 00:45:41.565]  They give you dog food ads on the TV and your smartphone.
[00:45:41.825 --> 00:45:43.506]  This is a total control grit.
[00:45:44.666 --> 00:45:46.947]  Told you about that six years ago.
[00:45:47.528 --> 00:45:48.408]  Not tooting our horn!
[00:45:48.768 --> 00:45:52.390]  I'm saying you better listen to us.
[00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:55.391]  Because we know the globalist game plan.
[00:45:55.956 --> 00:45:57.757]  And when we talk about it, we document it.
[00:45:57.977 --> 00:46:02.019]  I don't get up here and say, Congressman Brad Sherman said they were threatened with martial law, and then just move on.
[00:46:02.339 --> 00:46:09.503]  I say, guys, October 3rd, 2008, is our article, InfoWars.com.
[00:46:09.563 --> 00:46:10.463]  Pull it up with the video.
[00:46:10.743 --> 00:46:16.526]  They go do it, and in two minutes, have the video for you.
[00:46:16.986 --> 00:46:18.647]  Have the video for you.
[00:46:18.667 --> 00:46:19.648]  Okay?
[00:46:19.948 --> 00:46:20.668]  Listen to me.
[00:46:21.268 --> 00:46:22.969]  Listen, this is life and death, and I'm going to your calls.
[00:46:22.989 --> 00:46:23.529]  Okay?
[00:46:26.749 --> 00:46:29.630]  Get PrisonPlanet.com that needs to go completely viral.
[00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:33.613]  So much stuff is on PrisonPlanet.com that never gets on InfoWars.com and vice versa.
[00:46:33.673 --> 00:46:34.393]  I'm not complaining.
[00:46:34.633 --> 00:46:37.955]  We have different webmasters, different writers for both sides, some crossover.
[00:46:38.115 --> 00:46:39.676]  You gotta visit PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:46:40.296 --> 00:46:42.817]  Okay, because so much of it I say get on InfoWars doesn't.
[00:46:43.177 --> 00:46:44.618]  So go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:46:44.918 --> 00:46:49.561]  Here's this article with links to the Harvard studies and links to Colgate's own announcements, okay?
[00:46:50.021 --> 00:46:51.502]  This is life and death, okay?
[00:46:51.882 --> 00:46:53.863]  Toothpaste blast kids with 5,000
[00:46:56.963 --> 00:47:02.051]  Times more IQ-crushing fluoride than heavily fluoridated areas with water.
[00:47:03.188 --> 00:47:12.592]  We've got the Harvard study with massive IQ reductions, brain damage, huge increases in cancer with an index of 23 government and university studies.
[00:47:12.632 --> 00:47:20.115]  Now, up here, Colgate and others are coming out, oh, a thousand times isn't enough.
[00:47:20.155 --> 00:47:22.796]  They have fluoride, extra fluoride brand.
[00:47:22.856 --> 00:47:23.757]  It's like a sick joke.
[00:47:23.997 --> 00:47:27.098]  We expose vaccines are bad, they say now all pregnant women need extra.
[00:47:27.358 --> 00:47:31.220]  When the inserts always said don't give it to a pregnant woman, they know it causes miscarriages and brain damage.
[00:47:32.236 --> 00:47:36.659]  So when we expose that and it's on the insert, they say, no, we're taking it off the insert more for women.
[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:55.513]  So when it comes out and the American Medical Association and the American Dental Association six years ago, because of lawsuits and exposure, had to come out and say children under six should not brush their teeth with fluoridated toothpaste or drink it because it causes tooth breaking, bone fractures, bone cancer, and dental fluorosis.
[00:47:55.933 --> 00:47:56.454]  We don't believe it.
[00:47:56.474 --> 00:48:00.557]  Just type in American Dental Association says under six shouldn't have fluoride.
[00:48:01.397 --> 00:48:05.763]  How do they respond with us forcing that devastating victory for humanity?
[00:48:06.304 --> 00:48:07.625]  They quadruple down.
[00:48:08.126 --> 00:48:09.328]  Well, it's more than quadruple down.
[00:48:09.368 --> 00:48:10.209]  What's five times?
[00:48:10.890 --> 00:48:11.851]  Four times is quadruple.
[00:48:11.871 --> 00:48:12.532]  What's five times?
[00:48:13.233 --> 00:48:13.713]  Quintuple.
[00:48:13.994 --> 00:48:17.258]  They quintuple down from 1,000 times to 5,000 times.
[00:48:17.518 --> 00:48:19.180]  And they're putting it in thousands of foods.
[00:48:20.481 --> 00:48:25.123]  Kind of like we exposed what's going on with aspartame and brain damage.
[00:48:26.044 --> 00:48:28.685]  So now they put it in tens of thousands of products, used to only be in hundreds.
[00:48:29.385 --> 00:48:30.046]  It's in everything now.
[00:48:30.226 --> 00:48:30.826]  Literally, go look.
[00:48:31.547 --> 00:48:32.127]  Aspartame.
[00:48:34.068 --> 00:48:35.288]  Deadly excitotoxin.
[00:48:35.428 --> 00:48:38.230]  Deadly, deadly, deadly, deadly, deadly, deadly, deadly.
[00:48:39.417 --> 00:48:44.240]  You know they use it, fluoride, sodium fluoride as pesticide on crops because it kills the bugs and then it bioaccumulates.
[00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:46.321]  You know they use it in the white flour.
[00:48:46.401 --> 00:48:47.701]  They use it in the pizza dough.
[00:48:47.982 --> 00:48:49.242]  They use it in the cornmeal.
[00:48:49.302 --> 00:48:52.304]  Folks, it's, go read, it's unbelievable.
[00:48:53.204 --> 00:48:54.365]  Unbelievable.
[00:48:54.625 --> 00:48:56.066]  That's why you can't help the public.
[00:48:56.366 --> 00:48:57.547]  That's why, that's why...
[00:48:58.647 --> 00:49:01.652]  You talk to full-grown adults now, they're like mind-numb zombies.
[00:49:01.692 --> 00:49:03.114]  Folks, they have been murdered.
[00:49:03.334 --> 00:49:04.716]  They're not even alive anymore.
[00:49:05.056 --> 00:49:06.058]  They are zombies.
[00:49:06.598 --> 00:49:07.580]  Living zombies.
[00:49:08.141 --> 00:49:13.648]  That's why they're showing us all these zombies, as people at an instinctive level know we're turning into walking dead.
[00:49:14.309 --> 00:49:19.791]  And so it's a dehumanization and the idea of those of us that can still think subconsciously, hate the general public.
[00:49:20.071 --> 00:49:23.191]  Because we would have been genius level, we're just average IQ now.
[00:49:23.552 --> 00:49:25.292]  And so we have a disdain for the zombies.
[00:49:25.312 --> 00:49:26.632]  You can't have disdain for them.
[00:49:26.912 --> 00:49:28.213]  These are victims.
[00:49:28.693 --> 00:49:30.413]  These people have been savaged.
[00:49:30.934 --> 00:49:32.754]  Go read the article, get it out to everybody.
[00:49:32.774 --> 00:49:33.514]  We'll tweet it out.
[00:49:34.014 --> 00:49:35.775]  Get real Alex Jones, warn people.
[00:49:37.619 --> 00:49:38.700]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:41.502]  We're going to go to them when we come back from break for two segments.
[00:49:41.522 --> 00:49:42.682]  Then Jesse Ventura's popping in.
[00:49:42.722 --> 00:49:43.683]  We'll go right back to your calls.
[00:49:43.983 --> 00:49:48.346]  But I mean, this is all real CIA people listening.
[00:49:48.786 --> 00:49:54.010]  Nobody warns you not to, you know, not to eat the white flour or brush with the fluoride tooth, but you're not part of the elite.
[00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:56.571]  That's because you get to go kill people and do illegal stuff.
[00:49:56.831 --> 00:49:57.532]  You think you're tough.
[00:49:58.112 --> 00:49:59.093]  You're being destroyed too.
[00:49:59.653 --> 00:50:01.895]  FBI, cops, bureaucrats, come on.
[00:50:02.643 --> 00:50:03.603]  You're being murdered.
[00:50:04.064 --> 00:50:05.264]  I just want humanity to win.

[00:50:42.453 --> 00:50:44.777]  It may go three more days, it may end today.

[00:54:18.217 --> 00:54:21.740]  I'm going to go to your calls.
[00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:23.922]  I briefly wanted to go to this clip I mentioned.
[00:54:23.942 --> 00:54:25.903]  The full video is up at InfoWars.com.
[00:54:25.943 --> 00:54:27.745]  It's also the top story on DrugsReport.com.
[00:54:29.318 --> 00:54:31.739]  This is Jamie Foxx, who I think is a pretty funny actor.
[00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:35.902]  And, you know, they do it as if it's comedy, but it's not.
[00:54:36.462 --> 00:54:38.223]  It's done to create racial division.
[00:54:38.243 --> 00:54:42.445]  Somebody ought to ask Jamie Foxx, you know, he gets off on Obama, calls him Lord and Savior.
[00:54:44.146 --> 00:54:47.829]  Obama took the restrictions off basically paying women to have abortions.
[00:54:48.817 --> 00:54:51.301]  And if they're starving to death, it makes them do it in Africa.
[00:54:51.921 --> 00:54:54.125]  And massively increasing aborting black babies.
[00:54:54.165 --> 00:54:55.226]  See, here's the deal.
[00:54:56.047 --> 00:55:00.594]  I love humanity and I won't sit there and make evil decisions playing God.
[00:55:00.874 --> 00:55:01.695]  That's what globalists do.
[00:55:03.055 --> 00:55:08.198]  And people need to reach out to Jamie Foxx and say, I hope you enjoy all the aborted babies that are on your hands.
[00:55:09.079 --> 00:55:21.147]  Because that's what you've underwritten, saying Obama's our Lord and Savior and selling this racial politics so this infiltrator, Obama, can sell the entire country on collectivism.
[00:55:22.657 --> 00:55:26.562]  And I've talked to black folks who've said, I don't care if Obama's doubling abortion of blacks.
[00:55:26.582 --> 00:55:27.963]  There are too many little black kids anyways.
[00:55:27.983 --> 00:55:30.586]  In fact, we have those clips.
[00:55:31.767 --> 00:55:37.274]  It's the imagining you're in charge, and that your guy's in there, and you don't care if you're being poisoned and murdered.
[00:55:39.276 --> 00:55:39.817]  You don't care.
[00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:47.065]  If they're telling people, well if you want to be on welfare you gotta take all these vaccines and using these little black kids like pen cushions.
[00:55:47.385 --> 00:55:51.929]  They've done big studies and found double and triple the fluoride being added to the water in minority areas.
[00:55:51.949 --> 00:55:52.749]  You're being murdered.
[00:55:52.829 --> 00:55:54.030]  Oh, did you hear what I just said?
[00:55:55.211 --> 00:55:55.832]  But you don't care.
[00:55:57.233 --> 00:56:01.394]  Because it's more fun to go, oh, shut up, crackerhead, and stuff like that, and be murdered.
[00:56:01.794 --> 00:56:06.115]  And I understand it's, I mean, Republicans like worshiping Republican leaders.
[00:56:06.135 --> 00:56:07.615]  They don't care if they're run by foreign banks.
[00:56:07.815 --> 00:56:12.756]  They want to think they're winning and think, you know, John McCain's their guy, or think that Mitt Romney's their guy.
[00:56:13.076 --> 00:56:13.577]  I understand.
[00:56:13.617 --> 00:56:14.877]  People are in fantasy land.
[00:56:15.437 --> 00:56:20.578]  They don't want the real thing of really knowing the truth and really being informed and really being in charge of your life.
[00:56:22.058 --> 00:56:24.279]  They want government and media to tell them what they want to hear.
[00:56:27.267 --> 00:56:30.389]  Here's a clip and then we'll go to a caller, Robert in New York.
[00:56:30.729 --> 00:56:32.070]  Nurse's suicide story.
[00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:34.772]  Listing on 1310 AM WRSB.
[00:56:35.692 --> 00:56:36.333]  Here's that clip.
[00:56:38.474 --> 00:56:40.515]  And I got a movie coming out, Django, check it out.
[00:56:40.535 --> 00:56:46.539]  Leonardo DiCaprio, Samuel Jackson.
[00:56:46.559 --> 00:56:48.240]  Django Unchained, I play a slave.
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:50.321]  How black is that?
[00:56:52.262 --> 00:56:54.163]  And in the movie I have to wear chains.
[00:56:55.404 --> 00:56:56.365]  How whack is that?
[00:56:57.526 --> 00:57:04.887]  But don't be worried about it, because I get out the chains, I get free, I save my wife, and I kill all the white people in the movie.
[00:57:07.468 --> 00:57:08.488]  How great is that?
[00:57:09.488 --> 00:57:09.708]  Yeah.
[00:57:10.168 --> 00:57:11.949]  Let me tell you something, Jamie Foxx.
[00:57:12.349 --> 00:57:21.030]  Some African countries, 40 plus percent of the people have HIV, and even the BBC did a big study about 12 years ago and said, we don't know why they're all getting it.
[00:57:21.490 --> 00:57:24.831]  These women have never had intercourse, these little girls.
[00:57:27.150 --> 00:57:40.718]  How human is it, instead of saying, how black is that, to actually want to find out how the globalists are... Oh, you wouldn't be on TV very quickly, Jamie, if you went out and asked why in some country 40 plus percent of the people have HIV and are dying.
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:45.401]  Oh, so you're not going to talk about that, are you?
[00:57:46.401 --> 00:57:46.962]  No, you're not.
[00:57:47.382 --> 00:57:47.982]  That's what I thought.
[00:57:48.463 --> 00:57:49.283]  How black is that?
[00:57:49.723 --> 00:57:49.923]  Huh?
[00:57:51.604 --> 00:57:52.645]  How evil is that?
[00:57:53.826 --> 00:57:55.607]  See, evil's black, white, it's every color.
[00:57:56.874 --> 00:57:58.015]  People say, yeah, there's so many people.
[00:57:58.076 --> 00:58:02.781]  See, once you just sign on to that, once you say, hey, you know, let's kill them.
[00:58:03.202 --> 00:58:05.285]  And that's the attitude of the left, because they're not the left.
[00:58:05.525 --> 00:58:07.547]  We've all been around people that call themselves leftists.
[00:58:07.948 --> 00:58:08.789]  They're control freaks.
[00:58:08.829 --> 00:58:13.435]  They want to engineer society, because they get off on the idea of all that power.
[00:58:15.759 --> 00:58:16.719]  And then people sit there and beg.
[00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:19.321]  They're over a month into Hurricane Sandy now.
[00:58:19.741 --> 00:58:22.262]  And people are still saying, I want my power, I want my food!
[00:58:22.602 --> 00:58:25.964]  And the government's coming to them and saying, your windows are still knocked out.
[00:58:26.124 --> 00:58:27.305]  $3,000, $2,000 a day fines.
[00:58:27.525 --> 00:58:28.385]  They're taking their houses.
[00:58:31.147 --> 00:58:32.507]  Yeah, the government's going to give you some help.
[00:58:33.108 --> 00:58:33.928]  Really, Jamie?
[00:58:34.168 --> 00:58:35.549]  You got rid of your chains, huh?
[00:58:36.289 --> 00:58:39.151]  No, you're a slave for the New World Order to help sell out your people.
[00:58:44.727 --> 00:58:48.704]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:56.123]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu, and other illnesses.
[00:58:56.203 --> 00:58:57.304]  Don't be one of them!

[00:59:55.046 --> 00:59:56.987]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:57.427 --> 01:00:00.248]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:06.806 --> 01:00:10.991]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:11.652 --> 01:00:12.453]  You want answers?
[01:00:13.234 --> 01:00:14.115]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.775 --> 01:00:18.460]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:23.045]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.145 --> 01:00:28.847]  You see, we have to have a shadow government from a globalist perspective.
[01:00:29.907 --> 01:00:38.991]  Because if there's not, they'll be under oversight and can't build their whole secret government program and use our money for their projects.
[01:00:39.531 --> 01:00:40.712]  It's a scientific dictatorship.
[01:00:40.732 --> 01:00:41.512]  They're mad scientists.
[01:00:41.832 --> 01:00:44.593]  And I already knew that, but during the break it just hit me like a ton of bricks.
[01:00:45.213 --> 01:00:48.295]  So I was looking at an article at Infowars.com about a private moon mission.
[01:00:48.755 --> 01:00:50.896]  There's a reason stuff like that always gets sabotaged.
[01:00:51.796 --> 01:00:56.820]  It's because, ladies and gentlemen, the truth is we don't know the truth about a whole lot outside of daily events.
[01:00:57.540 --> 01:01:04.185]  We are living under a national security global dictatorship, and the globalists admit they're about 30 years ahead technologically.
[01:01:06.086 --> 01:01:10.389]  And most of us are walking dead already with the cancer viruses and all the rest of it they've already implanted in us.
[01:01:10.529 --> 01:01:12.351]  God help us, the things that are becoming in the future.
[01:01:13.544 --> 01:01:18.425]  And it'll just be normal that, you know, most of the population starts dying of different diseases that are engineered.
[01:01:18.445 --> 01:01:20.006]  It's really sad.
[01:01:20.766 --> 01:01:23.607]  Robert in New York, listening on 1310 AM, go ahead.
[01:01:24.607 --> 01:01:25.848]  Alex, it's an honor, sir.
[01:01:26.068 --> 01:01:27.008]  First time caller.
[01:01:27.808 --> 01:01:35.370]  Welcome from Rochester, where the graduation rate at the Rochester City Public School District is 19% over the years, okay?
[01:01:35.530 --> 01:01:37.351]  That's because that's done by design.
[01:01:38.288 --> 01:01:40.009]  Well, there's no question about it.
[01:01:40.329 --> 01:01:44.671]  First of all, Alex, I had a real interesting question about this nurse that I don't buy at all.
[01:01:44.731 --> 01:01:46.552]  It sounds like somebody went Princess Diana on her.
[01:01:47.052 --> 01:01:55.096]  But, here's an interesting story if you care to hear it, Alex, about cable TV with the ability to see you 15 years ago, a kid told me about.
[01:01:55.936 --> 01:02:01.158]  His dad worked at Harris Communications here in the city that has military contracts for communications.
[01:02:01.819 --> 01:02:02.459]  He retires.
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:06.042]  So what he does, he's got his cable TV goes on the blink.
[01:02:06.082 --> 01:02:08.043]  So he takes it down to his shop and works on it.
[01:02:08.503 --> 01:02:15.947]  He's shocked to find out that the same basic mechanisms of the relay switch for a cable ready TV are the same in military communications.
[01:02:16.048 --> 01:02:18.749]  Which means you either send or you receive.
[01:02:18.789 --> 01:02:19.870]  You never shut off.
[01:02:20.629 --> 01:02:21.069]  No, no, no.
[01:02:21.129 --> 01:02:27.571]  Cable boxes for at least, let's be conservative, 20 years have been two-way, watching and listening.
[01:02:28.031 --> 01:02:33.652]  I had an engineer in my house 15 years ago open up the cable box and say, you see the microphone?
[01:02:34.393 --> 01:02:38.514]  And we're talking, this is seven or eight years before they start claiming it's an application for things.
[01:02:39.654 --> 01:02:41.995]  So you can play online games and things and communicate.
[01:02:42.815 --> 01:02:44.095]  Of course, they've always been listening.
[01:02:44.955 --> 01:02:45.135]  That's 1980.
[01:02:45.956 --> 01:02:47.496]  Folks, we are not in Kansas anymore.
[01:02:49.403 --> 01:02:59.515]  I mean, listen, in the 40s and 50s and 60s and still ongoing, they were taking foster kids and putting them in chambers and frying them in some cases till they stuck to the floor.
[01:03:00.176 --> 01:03:08.206]  So if the government's going to fry little kids like fried eggs on purpose and not get in trouble and bring the drugs in, do you think they're going to have cable boxes watching us?
[01:03:08.246 --> 01:03:08.807]  Just a question.
[01:03:10.265 --> 01:03:10.745]  Absolutely.
[01:03:10.845 --> 01:03:17.251]  Well, I had cable installed about two years after I found out about this, and I asked the cable guy about it, and he says, how do you know about that?
[01:03:17.271 --> 01:03:19.332]  That's exactly what he asked me.
[01:03:20.313 --> 01:03:22.235]  Yeah, a lot of them get off on big power trips.
[01:03:22.275 --> 01:03:26.998]  I got a lot of death threats over when I first exposed it, because again, people weren't supposed to hear it at that time.
[01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:36.337]  You know, the Lord put it on my heart, you can call it sixth sense discernment, that this radio show and my physical person is in the greatest danger it's ever been.
[01:03:36.357 --> 01:03:37.778]  And I just need your prayers.
[01:03:37.838 --> 01:03:40.139]  But if they strike me down, that's God's will.
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:42.621]  The transmission has been sent.
[01:03:43.322 --> 01:03:46.444]  I hope to send more transmissions and continue transmitting.
[01:03:47.565 --> 01:03:49.146]  But, you know, it is what it is.
[01:03:49.186 --> 01:03:50.027]  I'm not backing off.
[01:03:50.067 --> 01:03:50.768]  I'm not stopping.
[01:03:51.348 --> 01:03:52.889]  And I can see all the signs, the attack.
[01:03:52.909 --> 01:03:54.531]  We're moving into the great time of pain.
[01:03:55.351 --> 01:04:03.673]  And, uh, you know, they're just admitting on the news, yeah, we're watching you over your cable box, your phone's listening to you, yeah, the government runs child kidnapping rings, you know, congressional hearings, what you gonna do?
[01:04:04.033 --> 01:04:13.734]  Yeah, we put cancer viruses in your vaccines, yeah, we gave 66,000, 67,000 kids polio under a UN program in India alone, yeah, we killed them, yeah, yeah, we're gonna murder you.
[01:04:14.454 --> 01:04:18.155]  You know, yeah, we're gonna set up checkpoints on the highways, yeah, there's gonna be breathalyzers in all your cars.
[01:04:18.495 --> 01:04:20.936]  Yeah, we're gonna, yeah, the cancer rate's exploding.
[01:04:21.216 --> 01:04:23.116]  I mean, isn't it just amazing what they do to us?
[01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:26.481]  Well, it was an honor speaking with you, Alex.
[01:04:26.561 --> 01:04:27.202]  God bless you.
[01:04:27.262 --> 01:04:30.584]  I believe everything you... Oh, by the way, the NFL's a propaganda network for boneheads.
[01:04:30.704 --> 01:04:31.785]  You gotta realize that, too.
[01:04:31.885 --> 01:04:32.445]  Have a good day.
[01:04:32.585 --> 01:04:33.766]  Yeah, no, no, I mean, I mean, they do.
[01:04:33.786 --> 01:04:41.411]  Every time I tune in, it's pro-war, pro-New World Order, anti-gun, and now they want to put breathalyzers on everybody's cars because it's some NFL guys.
[01:04:41.811 --> 01:04:44.233]  First, they want to start with all the NFL players guilty until proven innocent.
[01:04:44.693 --> 01:04:45.914]  Jesse Ventura coming up.
[01:04:45.954 --> 01:04:49.236]  We'll get his take on the Second Amendment NFL situation.
[01:04:49.736 --> 01:04:51.958]  It's a TV show and a lot more.
[01:04:51.998 --> 01:04:53.619]  And by the way, I'm supposed to call The Atlantic.
[01:04:54.079 --> 01:04:54.700]  Magazine today.
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:55.400]  I forgot about that.
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:57.322]  I was supposed to call them this weekend and today.
[01:04:57.722 --> 01:04:59.304]  They want to know about conspiracy theory.
[01:04:59.704 --> 01:05:00.605]  Is it being censored?
[01:05:03.868 --> 01:05:06.130]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East.
[01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:08.732]  But we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[01:05:09.472 --> 01:05:12.235]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[01:05:12.715 --> 01:05:15.057]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[01:05:15.518 --> 01:05:18.060]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:21.523]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[01:05:22.023 --> 01:05:26.669]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[01:05:27.229 --> 01:05:29.372]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.
[01:05:29.913 --> 01:05:32.976]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[01:05:33.577 --> 01:05:37.321]  I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.
[01:05:37.341 --> 01:05:40.966]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials.
[01:05:41.246 --> 01:05:44.608]  And you can start with a holiday gift pack that's normally $80, now under $50.

[01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:53.113]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:05:53.633 --> 01:05:56.735]  Would you rather prepare six months too early or one day too late?
[01:05:56.755 --> 01:05:58.356]  409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:06:02.663 --> 01:06:08.126]  Sodium fluoride in the body reduces IQ and increases cancers.
[01:06:08.426 --> 01:06:15.509]  Unfortunately, fluoride and its derivatives are only one of hundreds of toxins being added to our drinking water.
[01:06:15.809 --> 01:06:18.251]  We're battling the globalist on so many fronts.
[01:06:18.531 --> 01:06:24.594]  Health is an area where we can all take control of our lives, and it all starts with that basic building block of water.
[01:06:25.254 --> 01:06:28.037]  It is time to purify our family's water.
[01:06:28.297 --> 01:06:35.163]  The ProPure filtration system with added filters is the best system for my research to protect you and your family.
[01:06:35.183 --> 01:06:40.268]  Infowarsstore.com already has the lowest prices on ProPure water filtration.
[01:06:40.468 --> 01:06:43.230]  But until December 10th, we are going to offer 15%
[01:06:43.951 --> 01:06:44.472]  We're good to go.
[01:07:04.125 --> 01:07:11.789]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.
[01:07:12.229 --> 01:07:15.851]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.

[01:07:42.805 --> 01:07:44.446]  This is an amazing deal.

[01:08:06.854 --> 01:08:11.058]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:11.699 --> 01:08:12.499]  You want answers?
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:14.241]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:14.821 --> 01:08:18.445]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:19.025 --> 01:08:23.089]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:29.776 --> 01:08:35.218]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are joined for the next 30 minutes by former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura.
[01:08:35.738 --> 01:08:37.199]  I got a call last Friday.
[01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:38.319]  I still haven't called him back.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:46.543]  The Atlantic Magazine said, we want to know what you know about the FEMA show being pulled and the TSA show being pulled.
[01:08:47.043 --> 01:08:49.885]  And I was waiting to talk to Jesse and I just told him about it.
[01:08:49.905 --> 01:08:50.926]  He said, no, you just talk to him.
[01:08:50.966 --> 01:08:51.426]  So I will.
[01:08:51.886 --> 01:08:54.148]  So Aaron gave me that sheet, but I put it in my stack.
[01:08:54.188 --> 01:08:55.589]  We asked him to reprint that email.
[01:08:56.009 --> 01:08:58.131]  I was supposed to talk to the reporter this morning, but I wanted to wait.
[01:08:59.011 --> 01:09:01.453]  We'll get Ventura's take on the latest on that.
[01:09:01.653 --> 01:09:03.054]  And then I said, what do you want to get into first?
[01:09:03.094 --> 01:09:04.975]  And he brought up something near and dear my heart.
[01:09:05.496 --> 01:09:11.460]  This has been in the Dallas Weekly Magazine and the Dallas Morning News about yours truly.
[01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:18.844]  In fact, guys, just type in Alex Jones to protest 50th anniversary at Dealey Plaza.
[01:09:18.884 --> 01:09:20.465]  It'll pull up the article from a few months ago.
[01:09:20.925 --> 01:09:23.047]  I asked Ventura, I said, hey, what do you want to get into first?
[01:09:23.607 --> 01:09:24.668]  And he said, just that.
[01:09:24.728 --> 01:09:25.828]  He'll tell you the story.
[01:09:25.848 --> 01:09:27.089]  I haven't covered it in months.
[01:09:27.109 --> 01:09:28.490]  You probably forgot or weren't listening.
[01:09:29.150 --> 01:09:32.032]  That they're not allowing protesters.
[01:09:32.492 --> 01:09:34.734]  They're going to close the entire giant park.
[01:09:36.462 --> 01:09:40.667]  Which is city streets, by the way, and just have their propaganda on the 50th.
[01:09:40.707 --> 01:09:44.150]  Well, I said months ago when this was announced, we had Jim Mars on about it.
[01:09:44.471 --> 01:09:48.115]  JFK, truthers, banned from Dealey Plaza for 50th anniversary.
[01:09:48.455 --> 01:09:49.957]  Jim Mars was the first to tell me about it.
[01:09:49.977 --> 01:09:50.758]  He was in that report.
[01:09:51.218 --> 01:09:55.983]  And then again, the local newspapers all covered the fact that yes, it's a year away
[01:09:56.624 --> 01:09:57.605]  This country's even here then.
[01:09:57.625 --> 01:10:02.949]  I'm going and I just invited Jesse because if the police hold us back we'll still be 200 yards away.
[01:10:02.969 --> 01:10:04.891]  This is crazy!
[01:10:05.271 --> 01:10:07.253]  This is North Korea style censorship.
[01:10:07.513 --> 01:10:08.754]  Governor, what do you make of this?
[01:10:08.774 --> 01:10:09.615]  Give us your take on it.
[01:10:10.295 --> 01:10:18.562]  Well Alex, you know I was at the 40th anniversary one ten years ago and I found it very interesting when I was there ten years ago.
[01:10:19.392 --> 01:10:22.173]  There wasn't one official government person there.
[01:10:22.253 --> 01:10:24.194]  There were no elected officials there.
[01:10:24.775 --> 01:10:26.815]  The governor of Texas wasn't there.
[01:10:26.835 --> 01:10:39.501]  And I know there were about ten, eight to ten thousand people that gathered there and they asked if I would speak and so I spoke and I laughingly brought up the fact that I'm the Minnesota governor, where's the governor of Texas?
[01:10:40.242 --> 01:10:47.205]  And no public officials have ever been involved or acknowledged the DV Plaza anniversary until this year.
[01:10:47.998 --> 01:10:50.940]  Now, all of a sudden, they're going to cordon it off.
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:11:09.491]  I found this out because I spent two days last week with Judith Ferry Baker, who was Lee Harvey Oswald's lover when he had split up with Marina, and while he lived in New Orleans, who unequivocally will tell you that Oswald was a CIA operative and an FBI informant, both.
[01:11:10.312 --> 01:11:13.493]  He was an intelligence worker for the U.S.
[01:11:13.574 --> 01:11:14.034]  government.
[01:11:14.694 --> 01:11:15.534]  We're good to go.
[01:11:35.442 --> 01:11:36.063]  We're good to go.
[01:11:55.976 --> 01:12:05.002]  Bill O'Reilly's book on the Kennedy killing, someone told me that his scenario has Oswald doing it again, that it's an Oswald-only deal.
[01:12:05.063 --> 01:12:13.088]  So, you can see all the publicity coming out to promote the magic bullet and the Oswald and the Warren Commission story.
[01:12:13.689 --> 01:12:24.036]  But any free-thinking person who's ever done any studying of this whatsoever, even small bits of studying of it, will clearly see that the Warren Report is completely fraudulent.
[01:12:24.336 --> 01:12:36.226]  Well, I know you don't fly and so that's really restricted your movement because you won't be groped by giggling TSA pervs asking for your autograph as I have personally witnessed Governor Ventura joining us right now here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:12:36.487 --> 01:12:37.267]  He's just tuned in.
[01:12:37.748 --> 01:12:40.930]  But I will pay for your train ticket or I'll pay for your RV gas.
[01:12:41.091 --> 01:12:42.292]  You don't have to do that.
[01:12:42.532 --> 01:12:44.614]  No, but listen, I want to get you back down to Texas.
[01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:46.455]  Let's just say it right now.
[01:12:46.695 --> 01:12:48.977]  If you're able, you know,
[01:12:50.239 --> 01:12:57.889]  Coming up, 11 and a half months from now, let's be there, and even if they hold us back, it'll only blow up in their face.
[01:12:57.989 --> 01:13:04.017]  I predict they're going to cave in, and we'll all be there with a peaceful demonstration, exposing it down the street.
[01:13:05.291 --> 01:13:10.596]  Like I said, barring any unforeseen circumstances, I'd love to be down there.
[01:13:10.636 --> 01:13:11.077]  You know what?
[01:13:11.217 --> 01:13:12.378]  I'll rent a hotel!
[01:13:12.398 --> 01:13:18.403]  I'll rent a hotel ballroom, and then we'll have a whole JFK conference and have speeches and everything.
[01:13:18.443 --> 01:13:19.064]  That's it.
[01:13:19.564 --> 01:13:22.587]  We're doing it unless you've got a family issue or something.
[01:13:22.767 --> 01:13:23.188]  It's on.
[01:13:23.228 --> 01:13:25.790]  Absolutely, because I'm outraged over that, Alex.
[01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:29.754]  They've never bothered to show up at Dealey Plaza any other year.
[01:13:30.678 --> 01:13:35.101]  It's always been the people that don't believe the Warren Commission that show up there.
[01:13:35.861 --> 01:13:46.908]  And now, all of a sudden, on the 50th anniversary, they're going to keep us out of there, and they're going to open it up to only those that support the Warren Commission and Oswald alone in its scenario.
[01:13:47.568 --> 01:13:54.713]  And it's just absurd, because as I said, anyone that does even a little bit of studying on this, it becomes clear to you right away.
[01:13:55.433 --> 01:13:56.294]  I think so.
[01:14:11.329 --> 01:14:13.391]  Oh yeah, I've talked to the Black Secret Service agent.
[01:14:13.431 --> 01:14:18.174]  He hadn't come on air yet, but I talked to him through Jim Mars, who was actually there and also helped.
[01:14:18.334 --> 01:14:20.076]  Oh, that's all backed up, not just by her.
[01:14:20.096 --> 01:14:24.579]  I mean, we're going to air our interview with her tonight on the Infowars Nightly News that McBrain did a few weeks ago.
[01:14:24.599 --> 01:14:25.700]  He's just been adding documents.
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:30.443]  But just to back you and her up, it came out in different documents that have been declassified.
[01:14:30.483 --> 01:14:34.126]  His name connected to the CIA, high-level spy base, YouTube base.
[01:14:34.807 --> 01:14:37.769]  In Japan, he was allowed to defect as deep cover.
[01:14:38.389 --> 01:14:39.010]  Absolutely.
[01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:41.431]  He was the guy trying to blow the whistle.
[01:14:41.492 --> 01:14:42.712]  That's why they had to get rid of him.
[01:14:43.273 --> 01:14:50.378]  Well, he also knew about the fast-moving cancer because he was working on that with Judith in an attempt...
[01:14:51.155 --> 01:14:54.817]  He said I'm a patsy, that's why they had to kill him.
[01:14:54.857 --> 01:14:59.680]  He was the logical target because number one, he knew too much and they had to kill him for that reason.
[01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:10.667]  And number two, they set him up and he fit the scenario in the end where he could be that lone nut and be portrayed as he was in our history books, which is a complete lie.
[01:15:11.267 --> 01:15:12.708]  Governor, you know why they're doing this.
[01:15:13.229 --> 01:15:16.891]  I've seen literally in the last decade hundreds of scientific polls.
[01:15:17.172 --> 01:15:19.934]  We've done reports showing many of them at the same time.
[01:15:20.194 --> 01:15:23.556]  Between 88 and 92 percent is in the average zone.
[01:15:24.357 --> 01:15:29.261]  The lowest level that don't buy into it is around 80 percent.
[01:15:29.561 --> 01:15:36.686]  So when you've got on average about 10 percent of people that buy the official story, their whole facade caves in with that.
[01:15:37.007 --> 01:15:38.528]  They're desperate to prop it up.
[01:15:38.668 --> 01:15:39.729]  Why would the government
[01:15:40.848 --> 01:15:44.809]  Take over the whole area and say only official story aloud.
[01:15:44.829 --> 01:15:58.532]  Well obviously because you know they don't, the government will never admit what really happened and it is still the crime of the century no matter what anyone says because I've always believed this.
[01:15:58.692 --> 01:16:02.473]  If you can murder the president and get away with it, what can't you do?
[01:16:02.973 --> 01:16:04.554]  You can get away with anything.
[01:16:05.474 --> 01:16:25.053]  And so that's the reason it has to still be covered up, and that's the reason the government will never, no matter what happens, the government will stick to its original story, because if they ever admitted that there were people, and let me add to this, another book people need to read, not only Judah's book, but they need to read St.
[01:16:25.093 --> 01:16:26.054]  John Hunt's book.
[01:16:26.875 --> 01:16:27.996]  I agree, we need to get St.
[01:16:28.036 --> 01:16:28.417]  John.
[01:16:30.382 --> 01:16:30.742]  I think so.
[01:17:01.983 --> 01:17:07.486]  It was a military industrial complex CIA foreign banking coup and the same people are in charge today.
[01:17:07.506 --> 01:17:21.533]  You know, Bruce Willis, and I was even told about this before he was in Vanity Fair by Rick Linklater when he was here making a film with him, he saw some of my films and woke up and then Bruce Willis made the statement, the same guys that killed Kennedy are running the country today.
[01:17:21.553 --> 01:17:23.354]  And that's really it.
[01:17:23.974 --> 01:17:25.555]  We're under a CIA coup.
[01:17:26.954 --> 01:17:29.877]  Well, you know, it may even be beyond them.
[01:17:30.157 --> 01:17:32.499]  It may be somebody who runs them, too.
[01:17:32.599 --> 01:17:33.260]  The CIA.
[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:33.780]  I don't know.
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:35.082]  Who knows at that level?
[01:17:35.122 --> 01:17:48.334]  But certainly, you know, if people... It's just ridiculous, Alex, that the government is going to take this thing over and you're going to have to be ticketed to get to D. Lee Plaza this year with the correct ticket.
[01:17:48.914 --> 01:17:50.316]  Maybe I'll apply for a ticket.
[01:17:50.336 --> 01:17:51.557]  Do you think they'd give me one?
[01:17:51.917 --> 01:17:57.520]  I think you should do it, but separately be there and we'll have our own demonstration down the street.
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:00.842]  Dallas is still somewhat of a free area, my hometown.
[01:18:01.402 --> 01:18:04.423]  Maybe Glenn Beck, who's moved to Texas and is following me around.
[01:18:05.924 --> 01:18:11.827]  Oh, but I forgot, he's busy bashing Ron Paul all day, but then glomming on to Vince Vaughn, a Ron Paul fan.
[01:18:12.548 --> 01:18:16.209]  Side issue, it's just that yes, we'll go up to Dallas, we'll do it, we're going to be there.
[01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:18.871]  Shifting gears before we go to break, what do you make
[01:18:19.731 --> 01:18:20.252]  I don't
[01:18:50.251 --> 01:18:53.472]  Well, first of all, that's the liberal side of the takeover.
[01:18:53.512 --> 01:18:55.313]  Their job is to disarm us.
[01:18:56.173 --> 01:18:59.294]  The liberal point of view is that we shouldn't have guns.
[01:18:59.314 --> 01:19:00.655]  They should all be taken away.
[01:19:01.195 --> 01:19:03.256]  My argument is simple on that, Alex.
[01:19:03.816 --> 01:19:06.377]  Mexico is a country that doesn't allow guns.
[01:19:08.457 --> 01:19:10.078]  Do I need to say anything more?
[01:19:11.317 --> 01:19:16.822]  Well, I think- 20,000 Mexicans were killed last year in the war on drugs.
[01:19:17.563 --> 01:19:19.525]  Because they can't defend themselves.
[01:19:20.046 --> 01:19:23.089]  They're not allowed to have drugs, I mean guns.
[01:19:23.569 --> 01:19:26.872]  And it clearly shows the old cliché.
[01:19:27.313 --> 01:19:31.477]  If you take away the guns from the people, then only the bad guys are going to have them.
[01:19:32.486 --> 01:19:36.067]  And Mexico's the clear example of that thought process.
[01:19:36.827 --> 01:19:44.229]  The simple argument is to tell people Mexico doesn't allow drugs or guns, and look at the mess down there.
[01:19:44.669 --> 01:19:45.870]  And they've got drugs banned.
[01:19:45.890 --> 01:19:47.430]  That's also what's helping to destroy them.
[01:19:48.130 --> 01:19:52.091]  Let's come back and elaborate on that, talk about the TV show straight ahead.
[01:19:52.111 --> 01:19:57.873]  And I can get that email from the Atlantic Magazine, too, and ask you that question maybe for them on air.
[01:19:58.253 --> 01:19:58.993]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:59.033 --> 01:19:59.513]  Stay with us.
[01:19:59.553 --> 01:20:01.314]  Jesse Ventura is our guest.
[01:20:03.607 --> 01:20:08.409]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:11.831]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[01:20:12.271 --> 01:20:14.612]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[01:20:15.052 --> 01:20:17.573]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[01:20:17.993 --> 01:20:21.015]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[01:20:21.475 --> 01:20:26.017]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[01:20:26.597 --> 01:20:28.698]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.
[01:20:29.199 --> 01:20:32.180]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[01:20:32.780 --> 01:20:34.401]  I'm taking control of my future.
[01:20:34.881 --> 01:20:36.462]  And you're nuts if you don't do the same.

[01:20:55.610 --> 01:20:57.231]  409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.

[01:22:31.189 --> 01:22:32.270]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:32.430 --> 01:22:36.813]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:36.993 --> 01:22:42.717]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:42.817 --> 01:22:46.219]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:46.459 --> 01:22:49.061]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:51.323 --> 01:22:54.084]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:22:54.224 --> 01:22:54.465]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:54.525 --> 01:22:55.866]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:02.650 --> 01:23:04.131]  Hey there, Frank Bates here.
[01:23:04.892 --> 01:23:09.495]  Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans?
[01:23:09.975 --> 01:23:11.356]  This is really scary stuff.
[01:23:11.777 --> 01:23:16.480]  Defense experts warn that this odd device poses the gravest threat we've ever known.
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:24.226]  In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat.
[01:23:25.066 --> 01:23:27.287]  I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.
[01:23:27.847 --> 01:23:31.028]  It may be because the liberals in the government are trying to cover it up.
[01:23:31.649 --> 01:23:39.752]  That's why my friend just created a free video at WeirdDevice.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors off the conspiracy.
[01:23:40.192 --> 01:23:50.336]  Go watch the shocking video at WeirdDevice.com right now to discover exactly what it is, plus discover the number one way you and your family can survive this deadly attack.
[01:23:51.076 --> 01:23:55.928]  I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to WeirdDevice.com before it's gone forever.
[01:23:56.409 --> 01:23:58.454]  Again, that's WeirdDevice.com.
[01:24:25.805 --> 01:24:34.031]  Okay, here's Bob Costas on NBC, said the same thing on Fox as well, saying that basically football players can't be trusted to have guns.
[01:24:34.351 --> 01:24:37.613]  And now they're saying, in Dallas Morning News, they want to make them all have breathalyzers.
[01:24:37.973 --> 01:24:39.334]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[01:24:39.574 --> 01:24:45.418]  When somebody else does something wrong, if somebody in Texas kills somebody, we're going to make Jesse Ventura turn his guns in.
[01:24:45.818 --> 01:24:46.979]  I mean, that's just out of control.
[01:24:47.019 --> 01:24:49.561]  Let's go ahead and play this Bob Costas clip for the governor.
[01:24:50.137 --> 01:24:58.926]  You can't have 65 guys in their 20s and 30s, aggressive young men, subject to impulses, without something bad happening.
[01:24:59.446 --> 01:25:03.270]  And I posed this question, didn't have time to pose it on Sunday night, but I'll pose it here.
[01:25:04.211 --> 01:25:13.961]  Give me one example of an athlete, I know it's happened in society, but give me one example of a professional athlete, who by virtue of his having a gun,
[01:25:15.009 --> 01:25:18.310]  Took a dangerous situation and turned it around for the better.
[01:25:18.330 --> 01:25:20.130]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[01:25:20.170 --> 01:25:21.950]  Charles Barkley's come out and said this is pure bull.
[01:25:21.990 --> 01:25:23.491]  These are rich people, they're targets.
[01:25:23.811 --> 01:25:32.832]  We found dozens of examples, DrudgeReport.com, link to our story last week, of where NFL and other professionals have stopped home invasions, carjackings with guns.
[01:25:33.212 --> 01:25:34.953]  Governor, you've been an athlete.
[01:25:35.153 --> 01:25:36.373]  I mean, wrestling's hard.
[01:25:36.773 --> 01:25:38.853]  One of the hardest sports out there, many experts have said.
[01:25:38.873 --> 01:25:41.074]  You have a governor, all this stuff.
[01:25:41.334 --> 01:25:42.374]  I mean, this idea that
[01:25:43.254 --> 01:25:48.358]  That movie stars and people can't have a gun or that football players can't have a gun.
[01:25:48.639 --> 01:25:51.561]  I mean, why do we have 18-year-olds with guns in the military?
[01:25:52.101 --> 01:25:52.862]  Exactly.
[01:25:52.922 --> 01:26:07.774]  I mean, I find that laughable when they tell you 20 to 30-year-olds shouldn't have a gun and you make the exact point, Alex, you can go into the military at 18 and you can kill for the government and there's no problem whatsoever in that aspect of it, I guess.
[01:26:08.254 --> 01:26:15.098]  Costas would put a little caveat there stating military does not count.
[01:26:15.639 --> 01:26:23.944]  Because if he feels that 20 to 30 year olds should not have guns, then therefore there can't be a 20 to 30 year old in the military.
[01:26:24.984 --> 01:26:27.306]  We can only take over 30 using his analogy.
[01:26:27.546 --> 01:26:29.847]  But we see this more and more, like with the TSA.
[01:26:29.907 --> 01:26:31.007]  We're all guilty.
[01:26:31.607 --> 01:26:34.728]  And then it turns out that the government's running Al-Qaeda.
[01:26:34.748 --> 01:26:37.649]  That was even in the New York Times, finally, yesterday.
[01:26:37.689 --> 01:26:38.470]  We showed it earlier.
[01:26:40.110 --> 01:26:42.691]  Now the TSA is fanning out on the streets.
[01:26:44.111 --> 01:26:49.913]  This idea of, since one guy flipped his car drunk, we're going to make all the NFL have breathalyzers.
[01:26:49.953 --> 01:26:51.394]  That's incredible authoritarianism.
[01:26:52.514 --> 01:26:54.675]  I don't see where it could ever hold up, Alex.
[01:26:54.735 --> 01:27:01.258]  They have a collective bargaining agreement in the NFL as do all pro sports except wrestling.
[01:27:02.138 --> 01:27:08.801]  It would have to be approved by the union and they're not going to approve some nonsense like that.
[01:27:08.821 --> 01:27:10.841]  They're doing it selectively.
[01:27:14.943 --> 01:27:21.808]  If you alienate and ban certain people, it's all part of a bigger picture to ban it all together, and that's the way you erode it away.
[01:27:21.828 --> 01:27:30.954]  By taking little portions and all of a sudden you're going to tell NFL football players they're not covered by the Second Amendment, that they don't have Second Amendment rights.
[01:27:30.994 --> 01:27:41.742]  Well, maybe they don't, Alex, because after all, remember, when I tried to go to court over the TSA, I sued under the Fourth Amendment, reasonable search and seizure,
[01:27:42.242 --> 01:27:46.363]  And the federal judge threw it out of court stating she didn't have jurisdiction.
[01:27:46.383 --> 01:27:51.964]  So, you know, at airports you're not covered by the Bill of Rights or the Constitution.
[01:27:52.424 --> 01:27:56.444]  So this is just another part of them eroding it away bit by bit.
[01:27:56.464 --> 01:27:57.665]  You know, it's like anything.
[01:27:58.225 --> 01:28:01.225]  You know, water takes years to erode something away.
[01:28:01.245 --> 01:28:04.906]  And it does it just slowly by every little grain of sand.
[01:28:05.446 --> 01:28:10.527]  And that's what you've got happening here to our Constitution, Bill of Rights, not just the Second Amendment.
[01:28:11.047 --> 01:28:16.823]  But other amendments to it also are being slowly eroded away until they don't exist anymore.
[01:28:17.577 --> 01:28:17.917]  Yes, sir.
[01:28:17.957 --> 01:28:18.718]  We're going to go to break.
[01:28:18.738 --> 01:28:21.679]  You've got to go at 40 after, and then I'll go to all the callers that are holding.
[01:28:21.719 --> 01:28:23.680]  But let me raise this for you here.
[01:28:23.740 --> 01:28:28.562]  The Atlantic Monthly reporter wants to know, and I know you said I can handle it, but I want to get your take on this.
[01:28:28.602 --> 01:28:36.586]  He says, conspiracy theory with Jesse Ventura, you know, what happened with the FEMA show, the police state show, and the TSA show?
[01:28:36.966 --> 01:28:42.048]  And the question is, you know, is there a suppression of conspiracy theory?
[01:28:42.088 --> 01:28:44.009]  What's your quote for Atlantic Monthly magazine?
[01:28:46.178 --> 01:28:47.198]  That's what the facts are.
[01:28:47.258 --> 01:28:54.641]  That the FEMA show was taken off after airing only one time and I guess now they don't even acknowledge we did it.
[01:28:54.701 --> 01:28:59.023]  You can't get it unless you go to YouTube for that first one time it was on.
[01:28:59.823 --> 01:29:05.085]  And the TSA show, again, that's the world that we've completed the show.
[01:29:05.105 --> 01:29:08.026]  And they chose not to air it.
[01:29:08.266 --> 01:29:11.487]  So somebody on their end has made that decision.
[01:29:11.867 --> 01:29:13.408]  Who made that decision?
[01:29:13.628 --> 01:29:14.288]  I do not know.
[01:29:15.163 --> 01:29:17.864]  I can only say the True TV, the network did.
[01:29:18.304 --> 01:29:24.826]  Who influenced the network not to do that show, or not to air it, I do not know that.
[01:29:24.846 --> 01:29:29.287]  But all I can tell you is absolutely we've been censored, absolutely.
[01:29:29.307 --> 01:29:34.969]  Shows have not been shown and shows have been taken off after they've been shown only one time.
[01:29:34.989 --> 01:29:37.850]  That's right, we'll come back and talk about...
[01:29:40.234 --> 01:29:40.454]  It is.
[01:29:40.494 --> 01:29:44.977]  We'll be right back and get into the TV show itself and a little more with Jesse Ventura.
[01:29:45.037 --> 01:29:45.518]  Stay with us.
[01:29:51.422 --> 01:29:52.323]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.823 --> 01:29:54.424]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.345 --> 01:29:58.027]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.029 --> 01:30:06.070]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu, and other illnesses.
[01:30:06.150 --> 01:30:07.251]  Don't be one of them!

[01:30:29.757 --> 01:30:31.057]  I don't know.

[01:31:03.069 --> 01:31:07.933]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[01:31:08.654 --> 01:31:11.456]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[01:31:11.896 --> 01:31:14.258]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[01:31:14.719 --> 01:31:17.301]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[01:31:17.721 --> 01:31:20.724]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[01:31:21.224 --> 01:31:25.849]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[01:31:26.430 --> 01:31:28.572]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.
[01:31:29.112 --> 01:31:32.176]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[01:31:32.756 --> 01:31:36.500]  I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.

[01:31:52.833 --> 01:31:55.935]  Would you rather prepare six months too early or one day too late?
[01:31:55.955 --> 01:31:57.537]  409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.

[01:33:04.855 --> 01:33:11.142]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:12.883 --> 01:33:21.753]  I was just telling Jesse and Governor Ventura during the break, man, the best conversation is during the breaks.
[01:33:22.313 --> 01:33:24.395]  And he said, I'll say it when we come on air.
[01:33:24.915 --> 01:33:32.962]  Recap, in the words you used during the break, as you put it perfectly, what's happening with Dealey Plaza and the censorship and the free speech zones and all the rest of it.
[01:33:32.982 --> 01:33:37.986]  And then I want to finish up with the TV show, because I know when I talk to this reporter, he'll go, well, it did air once.
[01:33:38.026 --> 01:33:42.690]  Yeah, well, they air the others about 50 times over the next year, and they've pulled the TSA.
[01:33:42.730 --> 01:33:46.513]  I mean, it's all part of this story of more and more censorship and control.
[01:33:46.533 --> 01:33:47.874]  Go ahead and make your point on that.
[01:33:48.868 --> 01:34:01.703]  The one thing I'm deeply plausible, what irritates me is for 49 years, it's been us conspirators who have rallied there on the murder of Kennedy's birthday, on the anniversary, I should say, of Kennedy's murder.
[01:34:02.164 --> 01:34:09.032]  It's been the conspiracy people who do not believe Oswald acted alone or do not believe Oswald acted at all.
[01:34:10.074 --> 01:34:12.797]  Who have done their 49 out of the 50 years.
[01:34:12.817 --> 01:34:17.821]  Now all of a sudden, on the 50th year, we're not allowed to be there?
[01:34:18.201 --> 01:34:24.207]  And only the pro-Oswald, pro-government, pro-Warren Commission people are allowed in Dealey Plaza?
[01:34:24.787 --> 01:34:27.069]  After 49 years, they ignored it?
[01:34:27.110 --> 01:34:29.512]  They paid no attention to it whatsoever?
[01:34:30.092 --> 01:34:35.896]  And here on the big 50th anniversary, we're banned and they're going to be allowed to be there?
[01:34:36.016 --> 01:34:38.438]  I think that's unconscionable and outrageous.
[01:34:38.538 --> 01:34:40.659]  And Alex, you're on the right deal.
[01:34:40.699 --> 01:34:41.840]  Let's protest it.
[01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:50.526]  Let's get the masses, everybody that does not believe the Warren Commission should be there this coming year to protest government censorship.
[01:34:50.933 --> 01:34:51.653]  We've got a year.
[01:34:51.713 --> 01:34:53.494]  We can get thousands out there.
[01:34:54.275 --> 01:34:58.356]  Ladies and gentlemen, Governor, I believe, in fact, I know this is going to blow up in their face.
[01:34:58.436 --> 01:34:59.437]  I want your take on that.
[01:34:59.737 --> 01:35:17.145]  The attempt to take that big, giant plaza with three big roads, and if you haven't been there, it's a big triangle, folks, that's always just overrun with researchers and scientists and photographers that work for life, like Grodin, and just all these people there breaking down the facts
[01:35:17.685 --> 01:35:22.350]  I mean, you go down there sometimes, and Oliver Stone's been there at anniversaries and others.
[01:35:23.191 --> 01:35:26.454]  And now, and I've been there at probably six or seven of them, or more than that.
[01:35:26.974 --> 01:35:28.936]  Imagine, well, I was there once when I was a kid.
[01:35:28.976 --> 01:35:30.698]  My parents took me down there on the anniversary.
[01:35:31.078 --> 01:35:32.300]  I mean, I'm from Dallas.
[01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:39.347]  It's amazing that they would say in America, we're going to shut down downtown, and you can't be there unless you agree with us.
[01:35:39.767 --> 01:35:51.438]  Yeah, you can't be there unless you agree with us and you're ticketed, because I heard they're going to issue tickets and that you're going to have to have the required ticket to get past the barricades to be at Dealey Plaza.
[01:35:51.879 --> 01:35:57.765]  And I'm sure this year they'll have all these speakers that'll be there speaking and pointing to that Texas
[01:36:00.847 --> 01:36:23.674]  Well, that's what's really going on, is that the fellow who used to be a conspiracy person who knew the truth, he was the one giving control of the School Buck building that has that ridiculous museum that I know you've been in and covered.
[01:36:25.094 --> 01:36:26.375]  Are you talking about Gary Mack?
[01:36:27.492 --> 01:36:27.792]  Yes.
[01:36:27.812 --> 01:36:36.139]  Well, remember now, on my TV show, Gary Mack admitted on the TV show that it was his personal opinion that was more than Oswald involved.
[01:36:38.149 --> 01:36:38.689]  Incredible.
[01:36:38.749 --> 01:36:39.550]  But exactly.
[01:36:39.630 --> 01:36:46.373]  Now he's the one who's going to be allowed to run the entire thing and block citizens from entering the park.
[01:36:46.433 --> 01:36:48.694]  I mean, it's just... Oliver, let's remember something.
[01:36:48.794 --> 01:36:50.775]  Let's not put it all on Gary Mack.
[01:36:50.895 --> 01:36:51.896]  It's bigger than him.
[01:36:52.136 --> 01:36:52.556]  Of course.
[01:36:52.576 --> 01:36:58.759]  He just happens to be the guy that runs the museum who they will put as the lead scapegoat to do this.
[01:36:59.340 --> 01:37:07.724]  But always remember, we got it out of him on my TV show that he personally, personally does not necessarily believe the officials.
[01:37:08.166 --> 01:37:18.751]  I know, it's an amazing look he has on his face, for those that haven't seen the JFK episode, which I think is one of the best, where he kind of smiles and has a twinkle in his eye, because Jim Mars is on him forever.
[01:37:18.831 --> 01:37:24.353]  He used to be one of the guys out there protesting, and they came and got him and made him the head.
[01:37:24.853 --> 01:37:27.995]  That's the classic Judas story, just amazing.
[01:37:28.035 --> 01:37:31.576]  No, I'm certainly not saying he's the progenitor of all this.
[01:37:31.616 --> 01:37:35.838]  My point is, that facility, that group, is taking control of the whole thing.
[01:37:36.058 --> 01:37:44.244]  Did you see this year, on the 11th anniversary of 9-11, they barred the police and firemen from the pit because so many of them are 9-11 truthers, Governor?
[01:37:44.464 --> 01:37:45.905]  Yeah, no, I saw that too.
[01:37:45.945 --> 01:37:47.367]  You know, welcome to America.
[01:37:47.387 --> 01:37:52.951]  If you're going to go for something today, you better have the government's line or you're not going to be allowed there.
[01:37:53.571 --> 01:37:55.133]  You know, we should understand that.
[01:37:55.213 --> 01:38:05.667]  People should not be shocked because when the Wall Street protesters were out there, they were simply protesting, don't buy and sell Wall Street.
[01:38:05.687 --> 01:38:08.030]  Don't own our politicians, Wall Street.
[01:38:08.710 --> 01:38:09.852]  We're good to go.
[01:38:24.810 --> 01:38:28.474]  You're still not given habeas corpus if they arrest you.
[01:38:28.494 --> 01:38:31.739]  You're not guaranteed a lawyer in a trial anymore.
[01:38:32.079 --> 01:38:34.602]  This is not the country that I grew up in, Alex.
[01:38:34.683 --> 01:38:37.807]  It's far different today than what it was when I was young.
[01:38:39.710 --> 01:38:42.132]  Well, you're going to be going south to Mexico.
[01:38:42.232 --> 01:38:43.273]  Be safe doing that.
[01:38:43.693 --> 01:38:50.659]  In a couple weeks, your last visit with us while you're gone for four or five months to get out of the Arctic blow there in beautiful Minnesota with your wife.
[01:38:51.139 --> 01:38:53.481]  Well, Alex, it could be my last visit to the U.S.
[01:38:53.521 --> 01:38:54.222]  You never know.
[01:38:54.302 --> 01:38:56.944]  I could go to Mexico and never come back.
[01:38:57.925 --> 01:38:59.867]  In fact, you're given some inside baseball.
[01:38:59.907 --> 01:39:00.427]  What was it?
[01:39:00.847 --> 01:39:04.711]  Four or five years ago, you almost decided to kill Jesse Ventura.
[01:39:05.623 --> 01:39:06.904]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:39:07.464 --> 01:39:11.786]  But I just always remember, when I cross the border and go down into Mexico, there's always the chance that I will not return.
[01:39:11.806 --> 01:39:12.426]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:39:12.506 --> 01:39:13.967]  Yeah, I'll ride off into the sunset.
[01:39:14.027 --> 01:39:15.148]  Absolutely, at some point.
[01:39:15.188 --> 01:39:16.508]  It could be in two months, Alex.
[01:39:35.925 --> 01:39:39.171]  I'm telling you because I don't want you to talk about it.
[01:39:39.211 --> 01:39:40.814]  You're not getting the hint.
[01:39:53.968 --> 01:39:55.869]  All right, shifting gears and closing, I'm sorry.
[01:39:56.970 --> 01:39:58.211]  Okay, side issue.
[01:39:58.611 --> 01:40:00.932]  Anyways, let's just get back to what we were saying.
[01:40:01.493 --> 01:40:04.415]  How many more episodes of the show are going to air?
[01:40:04.435 --> 01:40:05.355]  I don't know.
[01:40:05.375 --> 01:40:06.396]  We did eight of them.
[01:40:06.416 --> 01:40:07.657]  They're going to air seven.
[01:40:07.677 --> 01:40:08.017]  I don't know.
[01:40:08.037 --> 01:40:09.077]  What are they on now?
[01:40:09.137 --> 01:40:09.858]  Four or five?
[01:40:11.199 --> 01:40:15.822]  Yeah, so I guess about... Yeah, so there'll be seven of them will air, even though we did eight.
[01:40:15.942 --> 01:40:19.584]  We did the TSA one, but that's not going to see the light of day.
[01:40:21.340 --> 01:40:21.700]  Absolutely.
[01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:24.281]  Well, maybe if we put pressure on it, then they will air it.
[01:40:41.377 --> 01:40:42.577]  Not if I don't come back from Mexico.
[01:40:42.597 --> 01:40:42.898]  I don't know.
[01:40:42.918 --> 01:40:44.138]  It all depends what I decide to do.
[01:40:44.218 --> 01:40:47.839]  Like I said, there'll come a day where I may not even come back to the country.
[01:40:47.859 --> 01:40:48.560]  I may stay gone.
[01:41:12.299 --> 01:41:12.720]  I don't know.
[01:41:13.361 --> 01:41:15.565]  I can't tell you what the future holds, Alex.
[01:41:15.665 --> 01:41:16.787]  I'm not a soothsayer.
[01:41:17.728 --> 01:41:18.208]  I hear you.
[01:41:18.428 --> 01:41:20.689]  And they're changing the days the show airs.
[01:41:20.729 --> 01:41:22.670]  I guess now Monday's the new day.
[01:41:22.690 --> 01:41:26.311]  Yeah, Monday's I guess, unless they changed it again.
[01:41:26.351 --> 01:41:33.654]  They showed it once on Wednesday and then they changed the time on Wednesday and then the third show they showed on Monday.
[01:41:34.174 --> 01:41:37.895]  So I guess we're on Monday now unless they shift us back to Wednesday again.
[01:41:37.955 --> 01:41:39.696]  I don't know.
[01:41:40.596 --> 01:41:42.437]  I'm not sure what's going on with the show.
[01:41:43.487 --> 01:41:47.830]  Alright, well, I'm going to play a clip here and say bye to you off-air and we'll see you at noon next Monday.
[01:41:47.930 --> 01:41:50.172]  Okay, Alex, we'll talk to you next Monday at noon.
[01:41:50.392 --> 01:41:51.513]  Thank you, let's go to that clip.
[01:41:53.574 --> 01:41:55.656]  And I got a movie coming out, Django, check it out.
[01:41:57.958 --> 01:42:01.560]  Leonardo DiCaprio, Samuel Jackson.
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:03.382]  Django Unchained, I play a slave.
[01:42:04.703 --> 01:42:05.463]  Uh, how black is that?
[01:42:07.385 --> 01:42:09.266]  And in the movie I have the word change.
[01:42:09.786 --> 01:42:11.488]  Um, how whack is that?
[01:42:12.645 --> 01:42:20.729]  But don't be worried about it, because I get out the chains, I get free, I save my wife, and I kill all the white people in the movie.
[01:42:22.590 --> 01:42:23.571]  How great is that?
[01:42:25.652 --> 01:42:26.473]  And how black is that?
[01:42:26.493 --> 01:42:33.456]  But I'm gonna tell you right now, speaking of blackness, my president, President Obama's back up in the White House four more years.
[01:42:37.258 --> 01:42:38.079]  How black is that?
[01:42:39.008 --> 01:42:43.371]  And not only that, he's so black, he was playing basketball during the election day.
[01:42:43.672 --> 01:42:45.373]  How black is that?
[01:42:46.594 --> 01:42:48.796]  But he was also late for his acceptance speech.
[01:42:49.836 --> 01:42:51.878]  Okay, all the white people, it's your turn.
[01:42:52.158 --> 01:42:53.359]  How black is that?
[01:42:55.621 --> 01:42:57.482]  But he's gonna be extra black this next four years.
[01:42:57.522 --> 01:42:59.364]  He's gonna get everything black.
[01:42:59.424 --> 01:43:01.946]  And white people don't get nervous about that because he is mixed.
[01:43:02.906 --> 01:43:05.569]  Now, the first four years was the white side of him.
[01:43:07.057 --> 01:43:09.538]  Because I don't know if you saw him on Ellen when he was dancing and everything.
[01:43:09.578 --> 01:43:10.518]  I don't know what this is.
[01:43:10.538 --> 01:43:17.641]  That wasn't President Obama.
[01:43:17.661 --> 01:43:20.382]  That was President Barry Gibb Obama.
[01:43:20.542 --> 01:43:22.542]  Alright, that's enough.
[01:43:22.922 --> 01:43:26.224]  By the way, in England, they arrest you if you're white and use the N-word.
[01:43:26.244 --> 01:43:28.584]  I mean, there's no free speech.
[01:43:28.804 --> 01:43:31.465]  But then, in the culture, it's pumped out constantly.
[01:43:32.226 --> 01:43:34.246]  And you can say he's doing a comedy routine.
[01:43:34.286 --> 01:43:36.247]  He has said, our Lord and Savior Obama,
[01:43:37.674 --> 01:43:40.275]  And it's just injecting racial division.
[01:43:40.295 --> 01:43:56.479]  I mean, if you watch Slimeball with Chris Maddys or whatever his name is, and Mr. Maddow and all those guys, if you watch that stuff, all they do is just, you don't like gun control, you're racist.
[01:43:57.899 --> 01:43:59.900]  That's what that Fox sports writer said.
[01:44:00.763 --> 01:44:01.604]  We gotta ban the guns.
[01:44:01.684 --> 01:44:03.445]  Anybody that owns a gun is KKK.
[01:44:03.986 --> 01:44:05.166]  I mean, it's amazing.
[01:44:05.967 --> 01:44:07.188]  Oh, you don't like government-run health care?
[01:44:07.208 --> 01:44:07.949]  You're a racist.
[01:44:09.029 --> 01:44:14.514]  And what they've done is taught white people to be totally guilty, mindless, obsessed with everything.
[01:44:14.534 --> 01:44:16.235]  So they say, pay more taxes, you're a racist.
[01:44:16.535 --> 01:44:17.696]  Jump off that cliff, you're a racist.
[01:44:17.996 --> 01:44:19.117]  Oh, yes sir, I'll do it right now.
[01:44:19.497 --> 01:44:25.422]  And then meanwhile, trying to get all the other quote minority groups all hyped up and racially based so they can be government controlled.
[01:44:26.263 --> 01:44:26.663]  Meanwhile,
[01:44:29.383 --> 01:44:35.026]  The government is absolutely hell-bent on destroying the black community in this country and every other community.
[01:44:35.867 --> 01:44:43.290]  And to watch Jamie Foxx, who is an absolute servant of the New World Order, getting off on it, it's so much fun.
[01:44:43.311 --> 01:44:47.473]  I mean, people actually, oh yeah, the black people are winning because there's a black president.
[01:44:47.513 --> 01:44:49.334]  I mean, it's like idiot Republicans.
[01:44:49.374 --> 01:44:51.275]  We're winning because there's a Republican in the White House.
[01:44:51.595 --> 01:44:53.756]  While the agenda moves forward.
[01:44:54.737 --> 01:44:57.018]  Obama is a total puppet of the globalist.
[01:44:57.901 --> 01:45:05.028]  And they have got their program accelerated, and you can see the divide-and-conquer balkanization politics they plan to use.
[01:45:05.048 --> 01:45:21.744]  Well, I'll tell you, that was a cliffhanger with Ventura, where I think he's actually on air before said the story he was saying about retiring from public life.
[01:45:23.609 --> 01:45:24.589]  And then I couldn't understand it.
[01:45:24.629 --> 01:45:25.749]  I'm like, no, you did tell me that.
[01:45:25.769 --> 01:45:26.790]  No, you did tell me that.
[01:45:27.110 --> 01:45:29.630]  I'm not going to sit up here like I'm making something up.
[01:45:30.350 --> 01:45:31.690]  I think he was in a grumpy mood today.
[01:45:32.070 --> 01:45:33.251]  You know, Jesse's bummed out.
[01:45:33.311 --> 01:45:34.811]  I'm going to tell you right now about the whole world.
[01:45:34.851 --> 01:45:36.071]  He really freaks him out.
[01:45:36.331 --> 01:45:37.531]  That's why I like Jesse Ventura.
[01:45:37.551 --> 01:45:38.391]  He's a real guy.
[01:45:39.132 --> 01:45:41.532]  And he's upset about the police state.
[01:45:41.592 --> 01:45:46.953]  He's upset about that Navy SEAL guy making that stuff up.
[01:45:46.993 --> 01:45:48.313]  And he is suing him right now.
[01:45:48.373 --> 01:45:50.934]  And boy, does Jesse have all the goods on the guy.
[01:45:50.954 --> 01:45:52.794]  That guy doesn't have one witness and Jesse has his.
[01:45:54.161 --> 01:45:57.105]  Not one person can come forward and say that happened in a packed bar.
[01:46:03.353 --> 01:46:05.713]  You know, Jesse is, uh, he gets bummed out.
[01:46:06.374 --> 01:46:08.134]  I met him seven years ago, and he wasn't like that.
[01:46:08.174 --> 01:46:10.815]  The more he... So many times, like, that can't be true, Alex.
[01:46:10.855 --> 01:46:11.555]  It's not that bad.
[01:46:11.575 --> 01:46:12.455]  And he's like, it's true.
[01:46:12.475 --> 01:46:17.816]  In fact, I was talking to him last week off air, and he goes, yeah, the cancer virus is what was on a break on Man Cow Show.
[01:46:17.836 --> 01:46:20.177]  And he's like, yeah, no, I didn't believe that.
[01:46:20.237 --> 01:46:23.137]  No, I'd seen all the proof that they do that to people.
[01:46:23.497 --> 01:46:25.398]  Oh, I mean, it is a bummer.
[01:46:25.658 --> 01:46:26.198]  But you know what?
[01:46:26.238 --> 01:46:31.639]  We've got to realize that we can get the word out to people, and we can change all this.
[01:46:33.410 --> 01:46:35.932]  We can get the word out and change it.
[01:46:36.392 --> 01:46:37.934]  We've faced a lot of bad things before.
[01:46:37.954 --> 01:46:39.155]  And you know, that's the problem.
[01:46:39.175 --> 01:46:41.977]  A lot of people, you wake them up and they get really bummed out.
[01:46:42.497 --> 01:46:44.639]  And they just want to go hide in the middle of nowhere.
[01:46:44.719 --> 01:46:48.042]  And I don't blame people that are, you know, above 60 year old, you know, doing that.
[01:46:48.102 --> 01:46:51.585]  But there's nowhere to go if we don't turn this around.
[01:46:51.705 --> 01:46:56.609]  And I understand when people hear this show and they think, man, this is over the top.
[01:46:58.610 --> 01:47:00.292]  But reality is over the top.
[01:47:02.267 --> 01:47:03.868]  I mean, I wish this wasn't happening.
[01:47:07.391 --> 01:47:09.192]  I wish it wasn't real, but it is.
[01:47:09.272 --> 01:47:10.053]  Let's go to your calls.
[01:47:10.613 --> 01:47:11.714]  David in FEMA Region 4.
[01:47:11.774 --> 01:47:14.716]  He wants to talk about the Chinese president.
[01:47:14.756 --> 01:47:16.057]  Not sure what that is, but go ahead.
[01:47:16.077 --> 01:47:16.778]  You're on the air, David.
[01:47:16.798 --> 01:47:17.278]  Thanks for holding.
[01:47:18.559 --> 01:47:19.059]  Hey, Alex.
[01:47:19.239 --> 01:47:19.860]  Pleasure, man.
[01:47:21.241 --> 01:47:23.483]  Uh, you know, it's funny how I found you.
[01:47:24.023 --> 01:47:25.985]  I typed in the interworld and I found you.
[01:47:26.265 --> 01:47:29.388]  And then I was telling all my buddies about it who were in the military and stuff.
[01:47:29.468 --> 01:47:31.990]  And they said, oh, we only knew about Alex Jones.
[01:47:32.090 --> 01:47:33.651]  I said, why didn't you tell me about it?
[01:47:34.707 --> 01:47:43.515]  But anyway, yeah, I watch CNBC in the mornings, every morning, and they get always put out a ton of information, and I saw that two weeks ago.
[01:47:43.555 --> 01:47:51.563]  They said that the Chinese president is getting ready to come up again, and the World Bank's in charge of who gets to go in that country.
[01:47:52.552 --> 01:47:53.052]  That's right.
[01:47:53.333 --> 01:47:56.535]  And of course, you saw that on CNBC.
[01:47:56.675 --> 01:48:02.839]  I mean, the World Bank now decides who becomes the Prime Minister of Greece, who becomes the President of Italy.
[01:48:03.279 --> 01:48:09.964]  They're in charge of who becomes the leader of the bank in England, who the leader of Ireland is.
[01:48:10.024 --> 01:48:12.906]  I mean, they're running the whole world and bragging about it.
[01:48:14.423 --> 01:48:15.363]  I know, I know.
[01:48:15.384 --> 01:48:16.864]  It's just, it's insane.
[01:48:17.224 --> 01:48:21.767]  And you know what's really, what's really sad is what's wrong with the American people.
[01:48:21.807 --> 01:48:22.687]  Everybody sees this.
[01:48:22.727 --> 01:48:27.289]  I go to gun shows, they're all stocking up for this, but nobody's talking about what solutions.
[01:48:27.629 --> 01:48:29.750]  We should be out there protesting big time.
[01:48:30.091 --> 01:48:33.712]  There should be 2 million people, 3 million people right now up in Washington, D.C.
[01:48:33.752 --> 01:48:36.194]  protesting what's going on, and ain't nobody doing that.
[01:48:36.214 --> 01:48:38.975]  We're just sitting back like, well, we'll see who fires the first shot.
[01:48:42.745 --> 01:48:44.986]  Yeah, and that's another cop-out.
[01:48:45.066 --> 01:48:50.188]  Saying we're going to be raptured, saying 2012 is the end of the world in 10 days, it's a cop-out.
[01:48:50.608 --> 01:48:58.171]  People are like, well, if the UN comes to my house, it won't be UN, it'll be US troops mixed in with foreigners under a US banner.
[01:48:58.511 --> 01:49:02.953]  That's what they train to do, literally hundreds of training ops we've documented, dozens we've been to.
[01:49:03.493 --> 01:49:04.134]  It's a cop-out.
[01:49:04.174 --> 01:49:05.755]  Well, I'll just wait here in my farmhouse.
[01:49:06.076 --> 01:49:12.802]  Anybody messes with me, I'm gonna, you know, and then you wait till you run up to a cop checkpoint, and a lot of these old guys do go out and shoot the cops.
[01:49:13.182 --> 01:49:16.386]  Why don't you go shoot the cops with information at the police station?
[01:49:16.606 --> 01:49:25.715]  Why don't you bug them at the coffee shop, bug them at the bar, give them info, shake their hands, wake them up, get them on our side, instead of talking about how you're just gonna kill them?
[01:49:26.175 --> 01:49:28.156]  Because let me tell you something, that doesn't hurt the New World Order.
[01:49:28.176 --> 01:49:29.137]  It makes me so angry.
[01:49:29.477 --> 01:49:34.539]  We need to be absolutely on the military and police, hammering them with the truth right now.
[01:49:34.559 --> 01:49:38.301]  You know, these guys talk about how, well, I'll just, if they come for me, I'll just shoot them.
[01:49:38.321 --> 01:49:40.502]  And by the way, people are planning, that is going to happen more and more.
[01:49:40.803 --> 01:49:44.665]  Then the cops get more and more scared of patriots, and then that's how the war starts.
[01:49:44.965 --> 01:49:50.648]  We need to be out waking them up, which is starting to happen, so we don't have this civil war the globalists have planned.
[01:49:51.550 --> 01:49:52.770]  Just like you just alluded to.
[01:49:53.571 --> 01:49:58.592]  Last week, I still don't have time because we got so much video, we're going to probably air it tonight on the Nightly News, if not we'll air it tomorrow on the radio.
[01:49:58.952 --> 01:50:02.093]  You know, where I went down and got in the face of the feds down at the federal building.
[01:50:03.133 --> 01:50:05.094]  Because they told my reporter she couldn't take photos.
[01:50:05.154 --> 01:50:10.075]  I went down there and got in their face, and had the federal police say, yes sir, you're allowed to film this.
[01:50:10.748 --> 01:50:14.251]  And look, the government's the types that'll come put something on me or whatever.
[01:50:14.311 --> 01:50:15.032]  I don't, whatever!
[01:50:15.712 --> 01:50:18.135]  You know what, I'm not saying bring it on because I'm macho.
[01:50:18.495 --> 01:50:20.076]  I'm saying I gotta do what I gotta do.
[01:50:20.156 --> 01:50:21.438]  You people are out of control.
[01:50:21.918 --> 01:50:23.259]  I'm gonna come up against you.
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:27.183]  And if you strike me down or set me up, you gotta deal with God.
[01:50:27.723 --> 01:50:31.767]  Because let me tell you, there's nobody more cursed than people that serve evil against good.
[01:50:31.867 --> 01:50:32.628]  I'll tell you right now.
[01:50:33.248 --> 01:50:40.332]  And I can tell you, I put my entire future and soul and will and everything into this, and have just committed.
[01:50:40.432 --> 01:50:41.233]  I don't have fear.
[01:50:41.453 --> 01:50:44.034]  Not for my wife, not for my children, nothing.
[01:50:44.054 --> 01:50:46.876]  Believe me, I love my children so much, I look in their eyes, I start crying.
[01:50:46.896 --> 01:50:51.718]  And it's because I love them that I am totally committing myself, them, and everything to this fight.
[01:50:52.639 --> 01:50:53.219]  Anything else, sir?
[01:50:53.239 --> 01:50:54.400]  I'm sorry I'm ranting, David.
[01:50:55.040 --> 01:50:57.802]  Yeah, have you seen Michael Rupert, The Real Truth of 9-11?
[01:50:57.842 --> 01:50:58.742]  Have you seen his film?
[01:50:58.762 --> 01:50:59.883]  Yes, it's a good film.

[01:53:11.781 --> 01:53:14.323]  And we're still selling them almost 30 years later.

[01:53:55.317 --> 01:53:57.259]  Longlifefood.com since 1983.
[01:53:57.939 --> 01:53:59.841]  Sending real food to your real future.
[01:54:05.185 --> 01:54:06.706]  We are on the march.
[01:54:07.067 --> 01:54:09.509]  The empire is on the run.
[01:54:10.229 --> 01:54:13.952]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:23.601 --> 01:54:27.084]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live, taking your phone calls.
[01:54:27.305 --> 01:54:37.534]  Coming up, at the bottom of the hour, I will give you a detailed breakdown of 10 reasons why it's not the end of the world as we know it.
[01:54:38.896 --> 01:54:42.579]  Media indulges in debunked hysteria while ignoring real crisis.
[01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:46.903]  Article that Paul Watson and I have worked on the last two weeks.
[01:54:48.147 --> 01:54:49.209]  And it's an important article.
[01:54:49.249 --> 01:54:52.072]  Please go read it at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:54:53.314 --> 01:54:57.078]  By the way, we're launching a new PrisonPlanet.tv next week.
[01:54:57.278 --> 01:54:58.300]  InfoWarsNews.com.
[01:55:00.456 --> 01:55:00.957]  I don't think so.
[01:55:26.940 --> 01:55:31.224]  So PrisonPlanet.tv, you can get 10 memberships for $5.95 a month.
[01:55:31.505 --> 01:55:33.466]  That's 59 cents a person per month.
[01:55:34.007 --> 01:55:35.729]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat that deal.
[01:55:36.309 --> 01:55:47.240]  You go create a new username and passcode, pay your $5.95, takes about a minute to sign up, and then you get 10 people can log in with that username and passcode simultaneously.
[01:55:48.951 --> 01:55:53.355]  Of course, nobody will usually do that, so it's more than 10 memberships, and you just give it in an e-card as a gift.
[01:55:53.895 --> 01:55:55.056]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:55:55.316 --> 01:55:56.297]  Christmas shopping done.
[01:55:56.758 --> 01:56:09.849]  Let's say you got 30 gifts you gotta give, and they're adults, the office or whatever, just create cards, print out a little sticker with a username and passcode, and say, here is your documentary film subscriber HD site.
[01:56:10.229 --> 01:56:12.051]  Because now we put a lot of stuff up in HD.
[01:56:12.471 --> 01:56:14.413]  Books, other films, it's ridiculous.
[01:56:15.614 --> 01:56:16.915]  Because we're being censored more and more,
[01:56:18.297 --> 01:56:20.122]  Other places like YouTube, that's why we've got it.
[01:56:20.142 --> 01:56:21.726]  That's why I built it 10 years ago.
[01:56:22.528 --> 01:56:25.597]  So it's world class now, and it's got a lot of new functions coming in next week.
[01:56:26.667 --> 01:56:32.733]  PrisonPlanet.tv, and you can get a yearly membership and get 5.3 months free off the yearly price.
[01:56:33.114 --> 01:56:36.197]  You can also do that, but this month-to-month thing where you get 10 memberships.
[01:56:36.697 --> 01:56:39.600]  Well, the yearly you get 10 for the price of the yearly, actually.
[01:56:39.620 --> 01:56:41.722]  I guess that's an even better deal, actually.
[01:56:42.063 --> 01:56:43.945]  Okay, PrisonPlanet.tv, there you go.
[01:56:44.405 --> 01:56:49.430]  ProPure water filters, we can still get them to you by Christmas if you order today, maybe tomorrow, but...
[01:56:50.532 --> 01:56:53.013]  It looks like we may sell out in the next few days.
[01:56:53.814 --> 01:56:56.175]  I mean, that means completely from the factory.
[01:56:56.295 --> 01:56:57.035]  Everybody's sold out.
[01:56:57.415 --> 01:57:01.217]  So you better get your ProPure 15% off at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:57:01.617 --> 01:57:03.238]  Okay, enough from me.
[01:57:04.379 --> 01:57:08.141]  Promo code Water15, by the way, to get that 50% off at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:57:08.741 --> 01:57:10.382]  Let's go to Michael in Florida.
[01:57:10.422 --> 01:57:11.482]  Thanks for holding, you're on the air.
[01:57:12.943 --> 01:57:14.704]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:57:14.724 --> 01:57:16.605]  I'm actually pretty freaked out how fast stuff's moving.
[01:57:17.363 --> 01:57:21.787]  I mean, they're on television admitting they're watching us over our televisions and cell phones.
[01:57:21.807 --> 01:57:26.150]  I mean, again, I knew that 15, 16 years ago, but now people are like, big deal, they're watching us.
[01:57:26.310 --> 01:57:26.911]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:57:27.391 --> 01:57:28.792]  I mean, it's just over the top.
[01:57:29.533 --> 01:57:37.900]  If they want us to give up ours, but what I wanted to ask you about is how come nobody voted, well, boycotted the whole presidency?
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:42.504]  It's like you get smallpox or you get herpes.
[01:57:43.004 --> 01:57:44.866]  You know, they have bad choices.
[01:57:44.926 --> 01:57:46.167]  Nobody hopped it out of that.
[01:57:48.066 --> 01:57:51.048]  I think I'd probably actually want the herpes over the smallpox, though.
[01:57:54.850 --> 01:57:56.070]  I mean, here's the problem.
[01:57:56.831 --> 01:57:58.331]  Exactly what Cynthia McKinney said.
[01:57:59.472 --> 01:58:01.513]  Obama is the more effective evil.
[01:58:01.573 --> 01:58:02.694]  It's like the surgeon.
[01:58:02.734 --> 01:58:04.115]  New World Order's chopping us up.
[01:58:04.355 --> 01:58:05.355]  They're a torture expert.
[01:58:05.375 --> 01:58:08.197]  And they go, do I use these pliers or this blowtorch?
[01:58:08.997 --> 01:58:10.498]  And they're like, I think I'll use the blowtorch.
[01:58:10.818 --> 01:58:13.800]  The same guy's got both guys under his control.
[01:58:13.820 --> 01:58:15.321]  Anyways, I'm going to hold you over.
[01:58:15.361 --> 01:58:15.741]  Keep going.
[01:58:16.556 --> 01:58:28.680]  Okay, but, I mean, just looking at what, that everybody's eyes are becoming more open in this country, and we have movements like, uh, boycotting the Wall Street, um, the Wall Street movement.
[01:58:28.780 --> 01:58:31.961]  It's like, why can't we do this to the presidential movement?
[01:58:32.721 --> 01:58:37.463]  Because we've had 44 presidents, none of them have fixed the problems of this country.
[01:58:37.503 --> 01:58:38.723]  Wow, that's a great question.
[01:58:38.763 --> 01:58:39.783]  Stay there, I'll answer it.
[01:58:42.524 --> 01:58:44.225]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.038 --> 01:58:49.281]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:52.263 --> 01:58:57.727]  Sodium fluoride in the body reduces IQ and increases cancers.
[01:58:58.048 --> 01:59:05.133]  Unfortunately, fluoride and its derivatives are only one of hundreds of toxins being added to our drinking water.
[01:59:05.414 --> 01:59:07.856]  We're battling the globalist on so many fronts.
[01:59:08.156 --> 01:59:14.201]  Health is an area where we can all take control of our lives, and it all starts with that basic building block of water.
[01:59:14.861 --> 01:59:17.623]  It is time to purify our family's water.
[01:59:17.904 --> 01:59:24.549]  The ProPure filtration system with added fluoride filters is the best system for my research to protect you and your family.
[01:59:24.769 --> 01:59:29.894]  Infowarshstore.com already has the lowest prices on ProPure water filtration.
[01:59:30.074 --> 01:59:32.836]  But until December 10th, we are going to offer 15%
[01:59:33.697 --> 01:59:34.437]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:34.517 --> 01:59:36.478]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:06.650 --> 02:00:10.852]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:11.493 --> 02:00:12.313]  You want answers?
[02:00:13.094 --> 02:00:13.994]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.614 --> 02:00:18.196]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.817 --> 02:00:22.939]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:39.031 --> 02:00:41.052]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[02:00:41.072 --> 02:00:42.292]  We're talking to Michael in Florida.
[02:00:42.312 --> 02:00:43.292]  We're going back to him in a moment.
[02:00:43.332 --> 02:00:45.893]  He asked, you know, why can't we get a good president?
[02:00:45.933 --> 02:00:47.513]  Look, Kennedy wasn't perfect.
[02:00:49.394 --> 02:00:53.415]  But he really was trying to get a real civil rights movement going.
[02:00:53.915 --> 02:00:55.495]  He was going to end the Vietnam War.
[02:00:56.835 --> 02:00:59.996]  He stopped a nuclear war after the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[02:01:01.457 --> 02:01:03.297]  He was going to abolish the Federal Reserve.
[02:01:03.317 --> 02:01:04.937]  He signed the executive order to start that.
[02:01:06.778 --> 02:01:07.258]  And it killed him.
[02:01:09.791 --> 02:01:11.313]  And again, he wasn't perfect.
[02:01:11.353 --> 02:01:12.314]  I mean, I've actually studied him.
[02:01:13.334 --> 02:01:15.837]  His brother, Bobby Kennedy, wanted to blow up the U.S.
[02:01:15.877 --> 02:01:20.421]  Embassy in Honduras to blame it on them to be able to invade, and his brother overruled him.
[02:01:20.921 --> 02:01:24.244]  But then Bobby kind of woke up later and was against stuff, and they killed him too.
[02:01:28.508 --> 02:01:31.030]  Reagan was a president for a little while until he got shot.
[02:01:34.894 --> 02:01:35.975]  I know people that knew Reagan.
[02:01:35.995 --> 02:01:37.976]  I mean, he was actually anti-New World Order.
[02:01:38.776 --> 02:01:40.977]  He was kind of a communist at first, and that's on record.
[02:01:41.317 --> 02:01:44.719]  And then he got into John Birch stuff, and really wanted to be a president.
[02:01:45.179 --> 02:01:46.040]  That's when he was governor.
[02:01:46.460 --> 02:01:47.480]  He was Bohemian Grove.
[02:01:47.500 --> 02:01:50.162]  You know, the point is, not all these guys are evil.
[02:01:51.622 --> 02:01:54.844]  But they get in the power structure, and you get killed if you don't play ball.
[02:01:55.264 --> 02:02:01.187]  But Clinton, Bush Sr., Bush Jr., Obama, I mean, these are bad people.
[02:02:02.577 --> 02:02:04.019]  But with people like Bush Jr.
[02:02:04.079 --> 02:02:05.881]  and Obama, man, it's teleprompter city.
[02:02:06.542 --> 02:02:11.750]  Obama's watching SportsCenter, playing basketball, taking naps, you know, going to the theater.
[02:02:11.790 --> 02:02:12.692]  He's having a good time.
[02:02:15.217 --> 02:02:20.338]  I'm not saying he couldn't be president, he's obviously a real smart guy, but I mean, I get hating Obama.
[02:02:20.358 --> 02:02:23.378]  And I just hate Obama, people like it on the radio, and it's fun to hate somebody.
[02:02:23.398 --> 02:02:25.659]  But it's kind of like I did in Bush's second term.
[02:02:25.679 --> 02:02:26.739]  I'm like, look, he's a front man.
[02:02:27.519 --> 02:02:31.980]  But you have to destroy the cult of Obama, or they're going to get their whole agenda through.
[02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:38.541]  America's never been perfect, but because it had some property rights, it became the wealthiest country in the world.
[02:02:38.741 --> 02:02:41.262]  But then, when you become wealthy, you become the new empire.
[02:02:41.642 --> 02:02:42.842]  So then we've turned into that.
[02:02:43.996 --> 02:02:48.059]  So we get 50-60% depending on the four-year cycle turnouts for president.
[02:02:48.540 --> 02:02:51.162]  We had low turnout this cycle for both parties.
[02:02:51.602 --> 02:02:52.843]  We get 8.2-8.4 locally as the national average.
[02:02:56.024 --> 02:02:56.344]  Turnout.
[02:02:56.364 --> 02:02:58.005]  We need to get local turnouts up.
[02:02:58.025 --> 02:02:59.525]  We need to expose the voting fraud.
[02:03:00.626 --> 02:03:04.567]  You could have people run as New World Order candidates and then double-cross the globalists.
[02:03:04.927 --> 02:03:06.568]  They do that, and I'm not saying do that.
[02:03:07.208 --> 02:03:09.889]  But this is a war, and I've tried to have that debate with listeners.
[02:03:10.229 --> 02:03:20.013]  Do we morally have businessmen and other people act like they're globalists to get into city council and to get into state houses to double-cross the New World Order?
[02:03:20.393 --> 02:03:21.693]  You know, that's what you do in war.
[02:03:21.733 --> 02:03:22.574]  They've done that to us.
[02:03:23.274 --> 02:03:24.795]  I think the frontal assault's the way to go.
[02:03:25.195 --> 02:03:30.677]  Just discredit them, attack them, speak out against them, and ask people that serve the system, you really like where this is going?
[02:03:30.697 --> 02:03:32.198]  You care about your kids?
[02:03:32.578 --> 02:03:35.679]  Because even evil people deep down, a lot of them don't care about their kids.
[02:03:37.160 --> 02:03:45.063]  A lot of evil people were squashed when they were young, and they have this feeling of innate human strength, but they believe that if they cheat, they'll get ahead.
[02:03:45.933 --> 02:03:49.237]  But that never really gives value.
[02:03:49.877 --> 02:03:54.643]  Real value is in doing things on the good path as best you can.
[02:03:54.663 --> 02:03:56.284]  Doesn't mean you're not going to slip off the path.
[02:03:56.545 --> 02:03:59.148]  Doesn't mean in a moment of competitiveness you're not going to do something bad.
[02:03:59.548 --> 02:04:05.815]  But if you're not trying to govern yourself, well, you're going to slide right down into hell.
[02:04:06.115 --> 02:04:07.357]  Does that answer your question, Michael?
[02:04:08.887 --> 02:04:11.609]  Um, kind of, and I have one last question.
[02:04:11.729 --> 02:04:16.952]  When they're trying to take our guns right now, like, what phase of tyranny are we in right now?
[02:04:17.292 --> 02:04:18.053]  That's my last question.
[02:04:18.373 --> 02:04:28.378]  Well, we're in a stalemate, and these are great questions, we're in a stalemate where the gun culture, where's that Austin Chronicle thing with the lady hunting, is that out there now?
[02:04:29.119 --> 02:04:33.742]  I mean, all these women's magazines, whenever I'm at the store and women's magazines my wife takes,
[02:04:34.733 --> 02:04:39.815]  It's like women shooting, women hunting, women boxing.
[02:04:40.435 --> 02:04:48.737]  And what's happened is real feminine power has overtaken the feminist movement, and even liberal publications are capitulating to guns.
[02:04:51.198 --> 02:04:51.858]  I'm going to come back.
[02:04:52.198 --> 02:04:52.798]  Stay there still.
[02:04:52.818 --> 02:04:54.039]  I want you to have a follow-up question.
[02:04:54.359 --> 02:04:56.119]  I want to comment on where are we.
[02:04:56.719 --> 02:04:58.520]  We're in a death battle is where we're at.

[02:08:02.472 --> 02:08:13.101]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:13.221 --> 02:08:25.831]  Yes, the bugle sounds, the charge begins.
[02:08:27.110 --> 02:08:29.552]  But on this battlefield, no one wins.
[02:08:32.494 --> 02:08:37.598]  Alright, coming up after calls at the bottom of the hour, 10 reasons why it's not the end of the world as we know it.
[02:08:38.839 --> 02:08:44.743]  Media indulges in debunked hysteria while ignoring real crisis by Paul Watson and Alex Jones.
[02:08:45.524 --> 02:08:48.566]  We've got one of our reports up at DrudgeReport.com today.
[02:08:49.307 --> 02:08:52.629]  Spain threatens to deport filmmaker over anti-Islam film.
[02:08:53.613 --> 02:08:54.213]  Uh, video.
[02:08:54.693 --> 02:08:58.835]  Documentary questions whether Prophet Muhammad was child molester.
[02:08:59.515 --> 02:09:09.179]  Folks, when the media gives one of these things attention, and pre-hypes it, they're about to use this as an excuse for Muslims having uprisings in Europe.
[02:09:09.959 --> 02:09:17.842]  Europe is already having riots all over the place because they're in a depression, and they're going to just backdrop it, like, oh, look, the Muslim threat, we gotta take your rights.
[02:09:18.222 --> 02:09:22.264]  They're trying to stir them up, so they can take your basic liberties.
[02:09:23.434 --> 02:09:29.703]  And when the media builds up, oh, they're going to play the film Friday, that's to alert all the Muslim groups to get upset.
[02:09:30.464 --> 02:09:39.516]  So that they can keep their anti-Islam stuff going as a pretext to take over liberties in Europe and destroy free speech, while bringing in record numbers of Muslims at the same time.
[02:09:40.377 --> 02:09:50.946]  And ignore the fact that Western governments, especially NATO, that consortium of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization group, is working with Al-Qaeda.
[02:09:51.147 --> 02:10:00.375]  And I can't believe the New York Times yesterday came out and admitted the West is arming Al-Qaeda and basically said the CFR line that, well, we need them and, you know, they're not that bad actually.
[02:10:00.395 --> 02:10:01.596]  We're going to be friends with Al-Qaeda now.
[02:10:02.717 --> 02:10:08.527]  Until they blow up airliners in the West, which I am predicting will happen in the next two years if this continues.
[02:10:09.068 --> 02:10:11.692]  We could stop it by exposing it, but remember...
[02:10:12.540 --> 02:10:23.104]  That when they start shooting down airlines and that we've got to set up checkpoints now within five miles of the airport because these missiles fire to 5,000 feet and they're shooting aircraft that are coming in for landings and taking off.
[02:10:23.404 --> 02:10:24.205]  I can see the whole thing.
[02:10:24.525 --> 02:10:25.665]  We've got to have checkpoints.
[02:10:25.685 --> 02:10:29.207]  We've got to search vehicles on the highways because of the missiles, the missiles, the missiles.
[02:10:29.727 --> 02:10:31.228]  And I'll be like, oh, the government gave it to them.
[02:10:31.328 --> 02:10:33.028]  Shut up, you traitor, you filth.
[02:10:33.669 --> 02:10:35.289]  You un-American piece of garbage.
[02:10:36.430 --> 02:10:37.930]  I mean, you know, that's how they operate.
[02:10:37.950 --> 02:10:40.111]  I'm like, no, actually, the foreign banks run Al-Qaeda.
[02:10:40.451 --> 02:10:41.912]  Shut up, you anti-American traitor.
[02:10:43.399 --> 02:10:44.120]  Arrest him!
[02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:45.581]  Shut him off the radio!
[02:10:46.522 --> 02:10:49.264]  A major city just got hit by Al-Qaeda with a suitcase nuke.
[02:10:49.464 --> 02:10:50.325]  They're now hyping that.
[02:10:51.166 --> 02:10:53.388]  The globalists are setting up for a total takeover.
[02:10:53.428 --> 02:10:54.089]  What will trigger it?
[02:10:54.509 --> 02:10:56.851]  Something like a bioweapon release or a suitcase nuke.
[02:10:56.891 --> 02:11:01.095]  I don't know which one, but the elites are all moving to offshore islands and things.
[02:11:01.355 --> 02:11:05.238]  And I've talked to some of them off record, and they just go, oh my gosh, World War III.
[02:11:05.879 --> 02:11:07.080]  And I've been telling you this for years.
[02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:08.862]  And it's come out in the news it's happening.
[02:11:09.222 --> 02:11:10.203]  So we're going to get into all that.
[02:11:11.383 --> 02:11:15.626]  Now, if I can have a document cam on this for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, just wherever you're aiming it, I'll put it.
[02:11:15.666 --> 02:11:17.108]  Just aim it wherever you want.
[02:11:17.148 --> 02:11:17.528]  There you go.
[02:11:18.489 --> 02:11:19.430]  Some of my doodling there.
[02:11:20.390 --> 02:11:22.552]  And you can see this article out of the Chronicle.
[02:11:22.592 --> 02:11:27.636]  Now, I meant to bring these magazines this morning, but I got busy building Legos with my children and forgot to do it.
[02:11:28.317 --> 02:11:30.879]  This is the Austin Chronicle last week.
[02:11:33.752 --> 02:11:34.732]  To properly get to this.
[02:11:35.293 --> 02:11:40.435]  And in my house, there's these women's magazines just festooning the entire house.
[02:11:40.815 --> 02:11:45.898]  I don't think my wife even subscribes to these.
[02:11:45.938 --> 02:11:47.138]  We just got on some lists.
[02:11:47.158 --> 02:11:48.259]  We got all these women's magazines.
[02:11:48.599 --> 02:11:50.540]  And so I'm flipping through them, and I see them laying around.
[02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:52.541]  And it's women with guns, women hunting.
[02:11:52.661 --> 02:11:53.641]  I mean, just everywhere.
[02:11:54.082 --> 02:11:55.322]  This is the hottest thing.
[02:11:55.822 --> 02:11:58.964]  And I was watching, I think it's Discovery Channel.
[02:12:00.848 --> 02:12:07.351]  And they've got these shows with people in Alaska, and these women hunting and living on the land with their husbands, and how much they love it.
[02:12:07.891 --> 02:12:21.156]  And then I know, because I see all the former yuppies, because I've got small children, I go to these homeschool groups, and it's usually doctors, lawyers, scientists, and sometimes they don't even know who I am.
[02:12:24.019 --> 02:12:27.340]  And they're going, yes, we're here, you know, preparing for the engineered collapse.
[02:12:28.180 --> 02:12:39.843]  Uh, yes, I, I work in, you know, in, in, in, you know, you know, bio, uh, you know, serum developments, uh, in microbiology and, you know, there'll be a doctor there at the little party.
[02:12:39.863 --> 02:12:41.004]  This has happened like every time.
[02:12:41.024 --> 02:12:42.504]  It was like, you don't know who Mr. Jones is?
[02:12:42.524 --> 02:12:45.745]  Yes, he's aware of the, you know, I've been aware for 20 years of their program.
[02:12:45.765 --> 02:12:48.946]  Uh, they tried to invite me into it and there's all these,
[02:12:49.946 --> 02:12:58.754]  But the point is these women are all hunting and butchering their own food and going to these co-ops and milking their own cows and then the husbands go in and like are doctors and scientists.
[02:12:59.434 --> 02:13:08.702]  And I've been to event after event after event where these homeschoolers, they're middle class or wealthy homeschoolers, and they all know about the New World Order.
[02:13:09.636 --> 02:13:11.658]  And then I turn on TV and this is the new thing.
[02:13:11.718 --> 02:13:14.480]  So let me announce to you what this means.
[02:13:14.540 --> 02:13:16.922]  The globalists don't fully control the media.
[02:13:16.942 --> 02:13:23.788]  They're able to steer it with government money, with propaganda placement, you know, $10 million a year for pro-Obamacare messages in TV and movies.
[02:13:24.909 --> 02:13:25.810]  In fact, guys, type that in.
[02:13:25.830 --> 02:13:26.591]  People won't believe it.
[02:13:26.891 --> 02:13:27.411]  Just type in...
[02:13:29.462 --> 02:13:30.523]  I'm going to brainstorm here on air.
[02:13:30.543 --> 02:13:32.504]  This happens all the time that I start going a hundred directions.
[02:13:33.025 --> 02:13:38.669]  Type in, let me give you the exact headline, um, pro-Obamacare messages to be in movies and TV.
[02:13:39.349 --> 02:13:42.652]  And then it's a footnote, by the way, they're paying billions every few months for this.
[02:13:43.851 --> 02:13:47.234]  But they don't control every newspaper, every writer, every magazine.
[02:13:47.254 --> 02:13:48.454]  There's a lot of oversight.
[02:13:48.935 --> 02:13:51.617]  They just say, no protesting in Ground Zero.
[02:13:52.377 --> 02:13:55.620]  No police allowed, because so many cops get in Giuliani's face about the bombs.
[02:13:56.060 --> 02:14:01.324]  You know, they say no one allowed, unless you agree with the official story, at the JFK Memorial now.
[02:14:01.805 --> 02:14:05.848]  And now cops are showing up, arresting people at the park who talk to others.
[02:14:06.268 --> 02:14:09.710]  The famous researchers, you go talk to people there that are asking you questions?
[02:14:10.191 --> 02:14:11.292]  The tourists, they arrest you now.
[02:14:11.812 --> 02:14:14.393]  I mean, it's North Korea up in Dallas, and we're on the radio up in Dallas.
[02:14:14.873 --> 02:14:15.553]  Very, very scary.
[02:14:15.593 --> 02:14:18.153]  It's got newspaper articles like, well, maybe you should... Yeah, there it is.
[02:14:18.473 --> 02:14:21.794]  Modern Family, Grey's Anatomy, to feature Obamacare propaganda.
[02:14:22.374 --> 02:14:25.915]  Yeah, that's a... What is that?
[02:14:25.955 --> 02:14:26.515]  Daily Caller?
[02:14:27.695 --> 02:14:28.455]  No, that's The Inquisitor.
[02:14:28.515 --> 02:14:29.795]  No, no, no, no.
[02:14:29.975 --> 02:14:31.096]  Not feature the propaganda.
[02:14:31.116 --> 02:14:32.396]  They're paying for it.
[02:14:34.976 --> 02:14:35.837]  Anyway, side issue.
[02:14:35.877 --> 02:14:38.017]  Their name for it is behavior placement.
[02:14:40.860 --> 02:14:42.902]  Because it's not, it's not, it's not product placement.
[02:14:43.923 --> 02:14:44.964]  It's behavior placement.
[02:14:44.984 --> 02:14:47.967]  My term, 15 years old, is propaganda placement, but that's a side issue.
[02:14:49.468 --> 02:14:52.931]  I had a caller, we're about to go back to him, Michael, and we'll go to others.
[02:14:54.096 --> 02:14:57.099]  He was asking, you know, where are we on the scale of this fight?
[02:14:57.119 --> 02:14:58.160]  Yeah, there's an American magazine.
[02:14:58.500 --> 02:15:00.963]  Taxpayers to fund Hollywood Obamacare propaganda.
[02:15:01.003 --> 02:15:01.343]  There you go.
[02:15:01.363 --> 02:15:11.734]  And then they've got links to the mainstream news that California officials are overseeing the federal money in Hollywood for the messages.
[02:15:11.754 --> 02:15:12.394]  Okay, there you go.
[02:15:12.414 --> 02:15:13.616]  It's got links to it right there.
[02:15:14.591 --> 02:15:20.393]  Now the point is, see, that's a mark of North Korea or Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany when the government's involved in things.
[02:15:20.633 --> 02:15:21.673]  But they don't run at all.
[02:15:21.713 --> 02:15:25.374]  That's why they want fairness doctrine, internet taxes that can be selectively enforced.
[02:15:25.835 --> 02:15:28.475]  That's what, because they need to prop up the state-run media.
[02:15:29.176 --> 02:15:33.977]  I mean, look, most of these, this has been going on for 50 years or more, but now it's gotten really bad.
[02:15:33.997 --> 02:15:35.858]  But most of these big empires of media,
[02:15:36.798 --> 02:15:38.198]  They didn't build those empires.
[02:15:38.298 --> 02:15:44.620]  Government tax money built CBS, built NBC, built Fox, built CNN.
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.781]  CNN, until a few years ago, now they're cheaper.
[02:15:47.801 --> 02:15:49.001]  Says they don't have to do it.
[02:15:49.141 --> 02:15:51.222]  They were on military Pentagon satellites.
[02:15:51.842 --> 02:15:52.942]  Communication satellites.
[02:15:53.302 --> 02:15:55.303]  That's why it came out in the Washington Post in 2000.
[02:15:55.523 --> 02:15:56.843]  They reported it like it was no big deal.
[02:15:57.403 --> 02:15:58.884]  People say, well, I thought the mainstream media lies.
[02:15:58.924 --> 02:16:11.492]  No, a lot of them are like, oh, the reason the CIA and Pentagon's psychological warfare is that CNN, you know, approving all the stories is, well, you know, CNN uses Department of Defense satellites worldwide.
[02:16:13.092 --> 02:16:13.712]  See how that works?
[02:16:13.832 --> 02:16:15.153]  It is Department of Defense.
[02:16:15.493 --> 02:16:17.134]  Google is Department of Defense.
[02:16:17.494 --> 02:16:19.094]  And people are like, well, at least it's American.
[02:16:19.394 --> 02:16:27.837]  The Department of Defense, since 1947, when it became the Department of Defense, is run by the Rothschilds.
[02:16:28.718 --> 02:16:30.018]  They own the Federal Reserve.
[02:16:30.298 --> 02:16:31.419]  They own the Rockefellers.
[02:16:31.779 --> 02:16:34.200]  I told you this decades ago from top researchers.
[02:16:35.160 --> 02:16:39.682]  In Congress, from the congressional research, like Anthony Sutton, it's on record.
[02:16:40.163 --> 02:16:41.103]  And what did they do this year?
[02:16:41.143 --> 02:16:43.384]  They merged the Rothschild-Rockefeller private wealth.
[02:16:44.305 --> 02:16:47.746]  They've not just merged their banks, like 2000 publicly, they merged their wealth.
[02:16:48.587 --> 02:16:51.068]  Every time they arrest a Russian oligarch, Putin does.
[02:16:51.608 --> 02:16:53.810]  The money's gone because they were a Rothschild front.
[02:16:54.010 --> 02:16:55.751]  The Rothschilds sued over those claims.
[02:16:56.031 --> 02:16:57.531]  Major newspapers lost the suit.
[02:16:57.752 --> 02:17:02.174]  The judge said, basically, this suit proved those that you sued.
[02:17:03.800 --> 02:17:06.902]  Again, showing they're not all powerful, but look at this right here.
[02:17:08.543 --> 02:17:15.627]  If you look at the cover of the Chronicle, their November 30th issue, going out for dinner, and it's about a woman's hunting and butchering camp.
[02:17:17.165 --> 02:17:22.090]  Listen, when you butcher an animal, it's not fun to chop them up like you're some psycho and it's a power trip.
[02:17:22.431 --> 02:17:28.718]  You just go into a mode, even if you weren't trained in it, you like automatically know how to do it because your ancestors did it over and over again.
[02:17:28.998 --> 02:17:34.844]  You're hardwired, just like you smell a woman and you like how she looks and you know what to do.
[02:17:35.645 --> 02:17:38.788]  You know, it's all ingrained, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:17:39.895 --> 02:17:42.997]  And they've got an article in here showing women hunting.
[02:17:43.317 --> 02:17:45.139]  This is the most, here it is right here, document count.
[02:17:45.559 --> 02:17:49.102]  This is the most liberal publication in the known galaxy.
[02:17:49.342 --> 02:17:52.104]  The owner of this hates me with a passion.
[02:17:52.584 --> 02:17:56.347]  Physically runs out of a building if I enter it at some of the film events I've been at.
[02:17:58.028 --> 02:18:06.514]  And it shows whole baby feral hog grilled with herbs, white-tailed deer, the women learning how to hunt, learning how to butcher the deer.
[02:18:09.867 --> 02:18:13.132]  Folks, this is in almost all the women's magazines I run across now.
[02:18:14.554 --> 02:18:15.194]  That's winning.
[02:18:16.536 --> 02:18:17.357]  We're now winning.
[02:18:20.201 --> 02:18:21.924]  So you ask, where are we right now?
[02:18:24.618 --> 02:18:32.403]  There's basic hardwiring human coding to want to have the male and female roles, to want to protect your local tribe, to want to be strong, to want to thrive.
[02:18:32.824 --> 02:18:43.532]  Then there's globalist scientific dictatorship developed by inbred British royals and others who wanted to find why they were inbred and why their kids were being born deformed or stillborn.
[02:18:43.872 --> 02:18:44.933]  They funded eugenics.
[02:18:45.013 --> 02:18:46.434]  Eugenics told them they were the elite.
[02:18:47.114 --> 02:18:56.602]  The whole world is set up and following a pre-positioned program that invented computers, everything, out of eugenics, biometrics, all of it.
[02:18:57.003 --> 02:18:58.524]  All the new science has come out of this.
[02:18:58.844 --> 02:19:13.337]  You have the snake oil salesmen of Big Pharma who are literally selling stuff out of the back of a horse-drawn carriage saying it'll cure your eels, make you grow hair on your head, you know, heal you of your rheumatoid arthritis, whatever it is, if you drink this laudanum that was really opium.
[02:19:13.857 --> 02:19:16.178]  Well, those companies became ultra-rich.
[02:19:16.458 --> 02:19:20.059]  They promised the elites unlimited power if they'd give them funding.
[02:19:20.339 --> 02:19:25.261]  They created modern medicine that we're now under, and it's a giant extermination operation.
[02:19:25.661 --> 02:19:29.102]  So to answer the question of the caller, where are we in the scale of tyranny?
[02:19:29.343 --> 02:19:37.125]  We're in a death battle, with our food and water being poisoned, our air being poisoned, being brainwashed, being propagandized.
[02:19:37.145 --> 02:19:40.206]  5,000 levels of safe fluoride in the toothpaste covered that first hour.
[02:19:40.687 --> 02:19:41.147]  All of this
[02:19:41.807 --> 02:19:51.552]  While they're going after our guns and announcing, we'll just take your guns, you know, without a law, you have your Second Amendment, but still we can take them from you, you know, you have a right to have a pop gun on the blue moon.
[02:19:52.032 --> 02:20:02.078]  Doesn't matter, suddenly the liberals are all going out and buying as many guns as they can and deprogramming going, so they lie and come out and say that Obama is a mandate.
[02:20:02.118 --> 02:20:03.918]  This man wants your guns.
[02:20:04.099 --> 02:20:09.421]  That is the cover of the 60-page glossy magazine jam-packed with information.
[02:20:09.521 --> 02:20:10.742]  The December issue

[02:21:01.963 --> 02:21:02.363]  Hi there.
[02:21:02.964 --> 02:21:04.024]  My name is Frank Bates.
[02:21:04.485 --> 02:21:07.707]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[02:21:08.327 --> 02:21:17.133]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[02:21:17.493 --> 02:21:23.517]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[02:21:24.178 --> 02:21:25.779]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[02:21:26.379 --> 02:21:31.463]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[02:21:32.223 --> 02:21:39.327]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[02:21:40.187 --> 02:21:45.089]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patrons have already seen in the last three months.
[02:21:45.750 --> 02:21:51.653]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[02:21:52.253 --> 02:21:57.636]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:21:58.036 --> 02:21:59.176]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[02:22:03.308 --> 02:22:14.034]  You land in Buenos Aires, then a shuttle to Santa Rosa, where a nicely furnished cabin with all amenities, Wi-Fi, executive food and wine, and laundry service awaits.
[02:22:14.855 --> 02:22:17.877]  After a good night's sleep, your adventure begins.
[02:22:18.277 --> 02:22:21.719]  You're on a golden stag safari for big game.
[02:22:22.700 --> 02:22:23.681]  But it's not Africa.
[02:22:24.021 --> 02:22:25.102]  It's Argentina.
[02:22:25.582 --> 02:22:33.911]  One-on-one guided hunts for water buffalo, cougar, bighorn rams, wild boar, and the biggest stag deer in South America.
[02:22:34.371 --> 02:22:35.913]  All gold medal quality.
[02:22:36.253 --> 02:22:37.835]  All the action you can handle.
[02:22:39.321 --> 02:22:46.969]  Land Rovers, top rental guns with scopes, all food, beverages, hunting guides, ground transportation included and more.
[02:22:47.469 --> 02:22:49.752]  All more affordable than you can imagine.
[02:22:50.392 --> 02:22:55.197]  The adventure of a lifetime starts at GoldenStagSafaris.com.
[02:22:55.537 --> 02:22:57.159]  The big game hunting ranch.
[02:22:57.639 --> 02:22:59.421]  GoldenStagSafaris.com.
[02:23:05.359 --> 02:23:09.141]  In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break-in this year.
[02:23:10.221 --> 02:23:11.962]  Burglars call it smash and grab.
[02:23:12.302 --> 02:23:13.583]  Police call it robbery.
[02:23:14.183 --> 02:23:15.564]  We call it avoidable.
[02:23:16.084 --> 02:23:21.686]  We are Fake TV, a simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars.
[02:23:22.107 --> 02:23:27.009]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates the changing colors of a television.
[02:23:27.389 --> 02:23:33.412]  To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home watching TV, so they'll likely move on to an easier target.
[02:23:33.972 --> 02:23:40.897]  At only $34.95, Fake TV costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plans and makes a great Christmas gift.
[02:23:41.157 --> 02:23:43.378]  Or it's perfect if you're traveling over the holidays.
[02:23:43.779 --> 02:23:46.140]  Order your Fake TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV.
[02:23:46.160 --> 02:23:47.281]  Or go to FakeTV.com.
[02:23:47.541 --> 02:23:49.042]  That's 877-532-5388 or FakeTV.com.
[02:23:49.102 --> 02:23:51.184]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[02:24:07.878 --> 02:24:09.739]  What I'm trying to get at here is this.
[02:24:10.720 --> 02:24:11.560]  Then I'll go to your calls.
[02:24:15.022 --> 02:24:19.745]  They have to sell the public like it's a fad or the Christmas toy everybody's got to get that.
[02:24:20.105 --> 02:24:21.506]  Ooh, Obama won!
[02:24:22.147 --> 02:24:28.951]  It's a mandate for, you know, taking your guns and opening the borders and massive tax increases and then lots of pundits.
[02:24:29.864 --> 02:24:32.726]  Going, ah-ha, white races, you lost!
[02:24:33.226 --> 02:24:37.549]  Even though record numbers of, quote, whites who were conservative, you can look it up, didn't vote.
[02:24:38.190 --> 02:24:39.550]  They're like, this whole thing's staged.
[02:24:39.811 --> 02:24:41.472]  They're not voting racially.
[02:24:41.772 --> 02:24:44.594]  They'd vote for a black patriot in about one and a half seconds.
[02:24:46.008 --> 02:24:48.310]  After they stumbled over each other to get to the voting levers.
[02:24:48.871 --> 02:24:56.658]  But they just sell that, and so all these people that are fad-driven, that go out and do whatever the media... Oh, ooh, Obama, he's got a mandate.
[02:24:57.178 --> 02:24:58.579]  Ooh, he can do whatever he wants.
[02:24:58.980 --> 02:25:02.243]  And the Republican leadership comes out and goes, I guess you've got your mandate.
[02:25:03.023 --> 02:25:04.825]  All right, we'll give you two big tax increases.
[02:25:05.325 --> 02:25:07.647]  And Obama says, I'll take full takeover.
[02:25:08.328 --> 02:25:09.008]  I want even more.
[02:25:09.049 --> 02:25:09.949]  I want the power of the purse.
[02:25:10.430 --> 02:25:11.451]  Hold on, we won't give you that.
[02:25:11.531 --> 02:25:12.612]  Okay, maybe.
[02:25:14.070 --> 02:25:15.371]  I got control of the internet too.
[02:25:15.471 --> 02:25:16.733]  All right, I guess you beat us.
[02:25:17.353 --> 02:25:19.356]  They're all paid for by the same globalist.
[02:25:19.616 --> 02:25:28.745]  When you get to that committee chairman level, that's why Boehner and Obama are always playing golf and smoking cigarettes and they've been caught sneaking around drinking beer together.
[02:25:29.126 --> 02:25:30.147]  It's all a big joke.
[02:25:30.387 --> 02:25:34.331]  Those guys are, ah ha ha, let's go, let's go drink.
[02:25:34.752 --> 02:25:36.694]  I mean, that's why they're propping him up.
[02:25:38.226 --> 02:25:39.727]  Newt Gingrich was the same deal.
[02:25:39.847 --> 02:25:41.268]  Are there some good Republicans in there?
[02:25:41.308 --> 02:25:42.669]  Yeah, there have been some good Democrats.
[02:25:43.109 --> 02:25:44.571]  But we're in a lot of trouble here.
[02:25:45.591 --> 02:25:48.914]  And so it's this idea of, oh, there's a precedent.
[02:25:48.974 --> 02:25:50.154]  Obama can do whatever he wants.
[02:25:50.455 --> 02:25:51.255]  Well, he won.
[02:25:51.295 --> 02:25:52.836]  That means give him the power of the purse.
[02:25:53.677 --> 02:25:56.559]  Oh yeah, let's not have any separation of powers, any checks and balances.
[02:25:58.020 --> 02:26:00.742]  The truth is, they can't sell any of the tickets.
[02:26:00.762 --> 02:26:01.803]  That's in the Washington Post.
[02:26:02.203 --> 02:26:03.984]  It's record low that they've ever recorded.
[02:26:04.284 --> 02:26:07.627]  No tickets, hotels, no one's booking to go to the inauguration.
[02:26:09.650 --> 02:26:13.132]  It was the biggest inauguration ever, four years ago, on record.
[02:26:13.953 --> 02:26:14.773]  Well, how many did they say?
[02:26:14.813 --> 02:26:16.274]  Like five million or something?
[02:26:16.354 --> 02:26:17.194]  I mean, it was ridiculous.
[02:26:18.295 --> 02:26:24.018]  The truth is, Obama is completely unpopular, but they've got to act like, hey, everybody likes him, hey.
[02:26:25.359 --> 02:26:29.822]  Just like Mev Harris has said, she doesn't think we're going to ever have any real elections again until this turns around.
[02:26:30.002 --> 02:26:33.204]  So this was the most fraudulent she's ever seen, and she's nonpartisan.
[02:26:34.707 --> 02:26:37.948]  I mean, they just announced states before any votes were counted of the day.
[02:26:38.428 --> 02:26:40.028]  They announced Prop 37.
[02:26:40.769 --> 02:26:46.090]  Do you really believe that Californians didn't want stuff labeled when polls showed 2 to 1 they wanted it labeled?
[02:26:46.610 --> 02:26:48.370]  But magically, come on folks.
[02:26:50.171 --> 02:26:50.871]  Come on folks.
[02:26:51.471 --> 02:26:52.351]  The fix is in.
[02:26:52.431 --> 02:26:54.052]  If the government, let me ask this question.
[02:26:54.952 --> 02:26:56.392]  I said this in the first hour, I'll say it again.
[02:26:56.773 --> 02:27:02.314]  If the government on record did tens of thousands of experiments, some of which each experiment involved thousands.
[02:27:04.278 --> 02:27:13.043]  Our government, the Department of Energy, paid Israel the equivalent of, it was like 7, 8, 9 billion dollars, it's in my film Endgame, off Israeli TV.
[02:27:13.383 --> 02:27:14.243]  This is declassified.
[02:27:14.684 --> 02:27:26.090]  To take poor Jewish children, who were dark-skinned, the Sephardic Jews, who have more original Jewish genetics than anybody, Middle Eastern Jews, North African Jews,
[02:27:27.279 --> 02:27:35.866]  Our government paid Israel to take 110,000 of them from 1959 to 1969, the ringworm children, and say, we're going to take you in to check you for fungus.
[02:27:36.486 --> 02:27:39.248]  Some of them they hit with so much radiation they died within days.
[02:27:39.668 --> 02:27:43.411]  Others are still alive with all their hair falling out and stuff, and mentally retarded.
[02:27:44.412 --> 02:27:48.995]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, they had Department of Energy studies, look them up, where over 4,000 U.S.
[02:27:49.015 --> 02:27:50.216]  foster kids were killed.
[02:27:51.256 --> 02:27:58.601]  In some cases, they would burn the kid so, because they were doing different tests, so hard, they would be burned to the metal.
[02:27:59.301 --> 02:28:04.324]  Doctors that went public about it said that they would have to unstick them, like an egg.
[02:28:04.725 --> 02:28:12.650]  Now, if the people running things will burn a kid for no reason, because it wasn't about testing radiation, it was about testing government scientists to see what they do.
[02:28:13.470 --> 02:28:17.833]  They get big groups of them in there in white lab coats and say, watch this, to see and mark down.
[02:28:17.853 --> 02:28:22.256]  It's like when FEMA comes to police departments and says, George Washington was a bad person.
[02:28:22.516 --> 02:28:24.597]  They got guys sitting there with notes watching everybody.
[02:28:24.978 --> 02:28:27.499]  Yeah, and freedom's bad, and they're watching the cops.
[02:28:27.539 --> 02:28:29.621]  And cops would agree, they're like, you're going up the chain, buddy.
[02:28:29.901 --> 02:28:31.082]  You want a federal job right now?
[02:28:31.122 --> 02:28:32.243]  We're going to take this country down.
[02:28:32.623 --> 02:28:33.503]  Oh, you don't like that?
[02:28:33.543 --> 02:28:35.485]  You're going to get kicked off the force right now.
[02:28:36.025 --> 02:28:37.146]  Yeah, it's our country.
[02:28:37.366 --> 02:28:38.466]  That's what this is all about.
[02:28:38.506 --> 02:28:40.608]  They come in there, and they're just sitting there.
[02:28:41.308 --> 02:28:43.229]  Alright, we're gonna fry this little kid right now.
[02:28:43.489 --> 02:28:50.573]  Little kid's screaming in pain, burning, stuck to the metal.
[02:28:51.354 --> 02:28:53.875]  And the scientists are like, I'm out of here, this is pure evil.
[02:28:54.435 --> 02:28:55.096]  Oh, really?
[02:28:55.116 --> 02:28:57.117]  You're gonna get downed a car wreck next week, bub.
[02:28:57.397 --> 02:29:00.479]  Oh, but all of you that got off on this, get ready to go upstairs.
[02:29:00.719 --> 02:29:02.780]  You're on an elevator going right to the top.
[02:29:06.038 --> 02:29:06.738]  TSA!
[02:29:06.819 --> 02:29:09.320]  Yeah, you like taking women behind closed doors, sticking your hands down their pants?
[02:29:09.600 --> 02:29:11.241]  You're now in charge of this airport.
[02:29:11.261 --> 02:29:12.782]  And I'm a convicted felon.
[02:29:12.982 --> 02:29:13.943]  That's why we hired you.
[02:29:14.183 --> 02:29:15.004]  Welcome to the team.
[02:29:18.578 --> 02:29:20.178]  That's what Stalin, Hitler, all of them did.
[02:29:20.198 --> 02:29:20.979]  They hire criminals.
[02:29:21.579 --> 02:29:22.579]  Or hire criminal types.
[02:29:22.639 --> 02:29:24.520]  And we're now entering that vortex.
[02:29:25.100 --> 02:29:29.241]  So, all of you that signed on to this system, you like injecting little kids with syphilis?
[02:29:29.561 --> 02:29:31.041]  How about polio and they get paralyzed?
[02:29:31.261 --> 02:29:36.103]  How about frying kids with radiation while they scream and cry and defecate all over themselves?
[02:29:36.123 --> 02:29:37.503]  Oh, is that what you like?
[02:29:37.683 --> 02:29:39.504]  Well, that's who you worship.
[02:29:39.964 --> 02:29:44.065]  When you sign on to this new world order, you've just signed on to hell and all that comes with it.
[02:29:44.986 --> 02:29:47.468]  Okay, I'm gonna get to 2012, then I'll rush through your calls.
[02:29:47.869 --> 02:29:50.951]  But I am just absolutely telling you why I'm angry at these people.
[02:29:51.292 --> 02:29:52.192]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.693 --> 02:29:54.274]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.215 --> 02:29:57.897]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:03.191 --> 02:30:08.054]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the East, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[02:30:08.794 --> 02:30:11.596]  The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression.
[02:30:12.036 --> 02:30:14.377]  America's worst drought in agricultural history.
[02:30:14.838 --> 02:30:17.439]  And now the economic results of the presidential election.
[02:30:17.859 --> 02:30:20.861]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[02:30:21.361 --> 02:30:25.984]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect, and I recommend you do the same.
[02:30:26.564 --> 02:30:28.705]  It's time to get your own supply from eFoodsDirect.
[02:30:29.246 --> 02:30:32.288]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[02:30:32.908 --> 02:30:36.630]  I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.
[02:30:36.650 --> 02:30:43.254]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex to find the specials, and you can start with a holiday gift pack that's normally $80, now under 50 bucks.
[02:30:44.975 --> 02:30:47.216]  Remember, I can warn you but I can't feed you.
[02:30:47.236 --> 02:30:52.459]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:30:52.960 --> 02:30:56.061]  Would you rather prepare six months too early or one day too late?
[02:30:56.081 --> 02:30:57.742]  409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:31:01.994 --> 02:31:07.457]  Sodium fluoride in the body reduces IQ and increases cancers.
[02:31:07.777 --> 02:31:14.840]  Unfortunately, fluoride and its derivatives are only one of hundreds of toxins being added to our drinking water.
[02:31:15.140 --> 02:31:17.582]  We're battling the globalist on so many fronts.
[02:31:17.862 --> 02:31:23.925]  Health is an area where we can all take control of our lives and it all starts with that basic building block of water.
[02:31:24.585 --> 02:31:27.348]  It is time to purify our family's water.
[02:31:27.628 --> 02:31:34.496]  The Pro-Pure filtration system with added fluoride filters is the best system for my research to protect you and your family.
[02:31:34.516 --> 02:31:39.621]  Infowarstore.com already has the lowest prices on Pro-Pure water filtration.
[02:31:39.822 --> 02:31:45.488]  But until December 10th, we are going to offer 15% off the already lowest price.
[02:31:45.848 --> 02:31:47.891]  I know what I'm giving my family this Christmas.
[02:31:48.151 --> 02:31:48.712]  ProPure.
[02:31:48.892 --> 02:31:54.879]  Go to InfoWarStore.com and get 15% off the already lowest price out there with the code WATER15.
[02:31:54.899 --> 02:31:57.202]  WATER15 and you get 15% off at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:32:01.673 --> 02:32:05.694]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu, and other illnesses.
[02:32:05.774 --> 02:32:06.894]  Don't be one of them!
[02:32:06.994 --> 02:32:12.555]  Protect yourself with Supernatural Silver, a revolutionary new broad-spectrum antibacterial solution.
[02:32:12.695 --> 02:32:22.297]  Recent advances in silver technology have resulted in a silver solution that can be used daily to prevent bacteria, viruses, mold, and food poisoning, and help improve wound healing.
[02:32:22.497 --> 02:32:29.158]  Supernatural Silver is safe enough to consume every day, while powerful enough to destroy the causes of many serious diseases.
[02:32:29.298 --> 02:32:33.421]  Such as strep, staph, pneumonia, colds, flus, and other harmful pathogens.
[02:32:33.621 --> 02:32:42.588]  This new technology has the ability to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.
[02:32:42.728 --> 02:32:46.171]  The Science Digest Journal says, silver is our mightiest germ fighter.
[02:32:46.391 --> 02:32:50.014]  It is virtually non-toxic and is emerging as a wonder of modern medicine.
[02:32:50.234 --> 02:32:56.479]  Go to SupernaturalSilver.com today and use the promo code SILVER2012 for 20% off.
[02:32:56.619 --> 02:33:00.101]  That's SupernaturalSilver.com and like us on Facebook.
[02:33:09.408 --> 02:33:11.949]  Okay, Joe in Pennsylvania has been holding for an hour.
[02:33:12.610 --> 02:33:16.793]  Michael first and then Jared and Andrew and Andy.
[02:33:16.813 --> 02:33:19.255]  I'm going to get to all of you, I promise, before this hour ends.
[02:33:20.785 --> 02:33:24.108]  I've got to get into 2012 and the Mayan apocalypse.
[02:33:24.128 --> 02:33:27.912]  And we're going to be covering this more in the next few days with the hard cold facts.
[02:33:27.932 --> 02:33:28.873]  We're going to get into that in a moment.
[02:33:28.893 --> 02:33:30.935]  But first, let's just get through your calls real quick.
[02:33:31.900 --> 02:33:55.488]  By the way, when I talked about the Department of Energy, I saw a History Channel show, it had to be like 20 years ago, when the History Channel was just firing up, and the joke was it was the Hitler Channel because all they were airing was old World War II films, about the Department of Energy frying kids and how the kid, one kid got stuck to it, they cooked him so bad, and that's what they do at those.
[02:33:55.868 --> 02:33:59.529]  They sit there and see which scientist will get freaked out
[02:34:00.706 --> 02:34:06.651]  And then leave, or others that go, well it's for the greater good in case we're nuked, we must know what this does.
[02:34:07.912 --> 02:34:09.954]  Whereas you could do it with guinea pigs or whatever.
[02:34:10.814 --> 02:34:14.497]  And if you understand secret experimentation, you understand it all.
[02:34:15.218 --> 02:34:22.624]  Because we have a global shadow corporate government, that of course had to be shadow, to get our money and operate with no oversight.
[02:34:23.735 --> 02:34:33.841]  And they are a scientific guild attempting to attain extended life with high-tech systems they do not wish to be transferred to the public.
[02:34:34.362 --> 02:34:48.571]  Any technology allowed to be transferred to us, any iPhone, any Android, any computer, any TV, any cable box, any DVR, is an NSA globalist spy tool.
[02:34:49.761 --> 02:34:50.862]  They're all Trojan horses.
[02:34:50.902 --> 02:34:52.123]  You're not given anything.
[02:34:52.563 --> 02:34:55.865]  Not any medicine, not anything, unless it's meant to hurt you.
[02:34:56.826 --> 02:35:01.929]  Because you are seen as a plague, as a virus that has to be exterminated.
[02:35:02.250 --> 02:35:09.415]  And you see them in the news saying that, telling you, you're all gonna die soon, the mega-plague will be released, but it'll be an accident, you're prepared to die now.
[02:35:09.735 --> 02:35:11.976]  And you understand it's for the better, just go home and die.
[02:35:12.337 --> 02:35:13.818]  Everyone's being prepped for this.
[02:35:15.854 --> 02:35:19.657]  And so I, you know, in a way, I hope all you that serve this evil enjoy yourselves.
[02:35:22.099 --> 02:35:29.245]  Because if the globalists decide to pull the trigger on this and we're trying to stop them by getting the word out, you're dead.
[02:35:31.307 --> 02:35:33.549]  And I wish that you'd wake up before they kill you.
[02:35:34.190 --> 02:35:35.110]  Because see, here's the deal.
[02:35:35.170 --> 02:35:41.115]  They could launch what will be the end of the world for you individually at any time.
[02:35:41.556 --> 02:35:43.698]  Now, if you get robbed by Carmen, that's the end of the world for you.
[02:35:45.009 --> 02:35:46.290]  Still saying about depression.
[02:35:47.470 --> 02:35:50.311]  You know, one man's depression is another man's recession.
[02:35:50.331 --> 02:35:56.754]  Because if you've been out of a job for a year, or you had to take a job that paid you a third of what you were paid, you know, that's a depression.
[02:36:00.175 --> 02:36:01.956]  And they cooked these numbers out of Washington.
[02:36:02.036 --> 02:36:03.497]  It's admitted they're total frauds.
[02:36:03.517 --> 02:36:04.837]  They've never been this fraudulent.
[02:36:05.678 --> 02:36:06.938]  And yeah, people are waking up.
[02:36:06.958 --> 02:36:08.639]  You know, I see JP Morgan ads.
[02:36:08.739 --> 02:36:10.480]  I see Heritage Foundation ads on TV.
[02:36:12.065 --> 02:36:17.507]  I see these ads everywhere, on television, when I monitor it, and online, where America's gonna be alright.
[02:36:17.547 --> 02:36:18.307]  Here's Ronald Reagan.
[02:36:18.607 --> 02:36:19.548]  You know, we're gonna make it.
[02:36:19.568 --> 02:36:20.808]  You know, Thanksgiving's great.
[02:36:20.848 --> 02:36:21.628]  Brought to you by J.P.
[02:36:21.648 --> 02:36:21.928]  Morgan.
[02:36:23.049 --> 02:36:28.631]  They want you to be positive, so while they're killing you, you'll feel like everything's okay.
[02:36:28.951 --> 02:36:34.133]  Well, why don't you globalists just release a nerve gas that makes us feel euphoric while we die?
[02:36:35.573 --> 02:36:36.894]  You know, it's basically the same thing.
[02:36:36.914 --> 02:36:39.755]  You know,
[02:36:42.123 --> 02:36:42.944]  It's just so sick.
[02:36:43.804 --> 02:36:46.986]  And it's a bunch of competing agendas, even within the power structure.
[02:36:47.747 --> 02:37:00.115]  But whatever the most evil technology is of control, it will be seized on by someone in the structure, they will immediately be accelerated to the throne room of power, and then only the next most cunning combine will replace them.
[02:37:02.096 --> 02:37:05.298]  Until you have pure crystalline destruction in charge.
[02:37:09.045 --> 02:37:11.086]  Okay, Michael, does that answer your question from earlier?
[02:37:11.146 --> 02:37:12.246]  Go ahead, you've got 30 seconds.
[02:37:13.326 --> 02:37:28.090]  Yeah, that does answer the question, and hopefully you do an analysis on the fiscal cliff that Obama's talking about from this year and the one from last year, where he's talking about cutting our budget and adding to science and stuff like that.
[02:37:28.150 --> 02:37:28.530]  Thank you, sir.
[02:37:28.550 --> 02:37:30.211]  It's all total lies and propaganda.
[02:37:30.491 --> 02:37:37.293]  The lion's share of it goes to foreign banks, and the next largest share to defense, and the third largest share in entitlements to keep people dependent.
[02:37:38.157 --> 02:37:38.958]  I mean, it's that simple.
[02:37:39.318 --> 02:37:43.180]  Make it where you don't know how to catch fish, you gotta get fish from them.
[02:37:43.820 --> 02:37:54.166]  Make it where you're totally dependent, and even though they're gonna cut, cut, cut, cut, cut with inflation, how much you really get and your standard's gonna go down of living, you'll still only see the government as where you can make it.
[02:37:55.027 --> 02:37:57.869]  And man, once they get us, they want to wreck the economy.
[02:37:58.689 --> 02:38:00.490]  That's, every authoritarian wants to do that.
[02:38:01.671 --> 02:38:02.731]  Because it makes you dependent.
[02:38:02.892 --> 02:38:04.933]  Jared in Colorado, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:38:06.877 --> 02:38:09.258]  Hey Alex, it's Jared from FEMA Region 8.
[02:38:09.878 --> 02:38:11.739]  I just was calling to say great show.
[02:38:12.779 --> 02:38:14.800]  There's a few things I wanted to talk about today.
[02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:16.181]  One was about guns.
[02:38:16.921 --> 02:38:21.383]  Two years ago when I first started looking for you, I actually didn't have a gun.
[02:38:21.403 --> 02:38:25.024]  I was listening to you saying that they're coming out for a gun, so I went and got some.
[02:38:25.084 --> 02:38:28.025]  I really enjoy the Brothers in Arms segment that you're doing.
[02:38:28.065 --> 02:38:30.286]  When do you think you're going to be doing your next Brothers in Arms?
[02:38:30.882 --> 02:38:32.082]  Alright, here's the problem.
[02:38:32.202 --> 02:38:34.083]  Shane Steiner, Sid Steiner want to do it.
[02:38:34.523 --> 02:38:35.203]  We want to do it.
[02:38:37.364 --> 02:38:41.265]  There's the obvious liability issues of doing shows with firearms, but I can do the waivers.
[02:38:41.905 --> 02:38:46.766]  I just had to look at everything and for now at least decide that there's so many other big things.
[02:38:47.166 --> 02:38:48.727]  Like, I love going out and shooting guns.
[02:38:50.212 --> 02:38:53.374]  Um, but I got a .50 Cal I haven't shot yet.
[02:38:53.414 --> 02:38:54.495]  We need to get out there and shoot.
[02:38:55.135 --> 02:38:57.417]  Uh, it's awesome going on the Stoners 12,000 acre ranch.
[02:38:57.437 --> 02:38:59.238]  Those guys are the coolest guys you can hang around with.
[02:38:59.438 --> 02:39:02.900]  Just real people, you know, like eighth generation rodeoers.
[02:39:02.920 --> 02:39:03.961]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[02:39:04.581 --> 02:39:06.082]  Uh, just good people as good as it gets.
[02:39:06.582 --> 02:39:12.666]  I just don't ever have to, but yes, we plan on doing the show down the road, uh, and more gun reviews and things.
[02:39:14.707 --> 02:39:15.408]  Listen, here's the deal.
[02:39:16.619 --> 02:39:18.080]  I'm not here to just make money.
[02:39:18.360 --> 02:39:28.543]  If I wanted to just make money, I could go promote it and pack 5,000 room halls out and charge people $300 a head like Glenn Beck does and fly around in a private jet.
[02:39:29.003 --> 02:39:30.964]  It just horrifies me.
[02:39:34.813 --> 02:39:38.994]  You know, but you can't go rent that hall if you don't charge people at least 50 bucks, because then you lose money.
[02:39:39.694 --> 02:39:40.735]  So it's a catch-22.
[02:39:42.155 --> 02:39:53.598]  I've had all these biggest book deals, biggest publishers in the country, I say all, like seven or eight of them, come and say, okay, you want $500,000, you know, sign-up, you know, retainer?
[02:39:54.279 --> 02:39:55.939]  Well, we'll get you the right Ghostwriter.
[02:39:56.219 --> 02:40:01.781]  And before I had a smaller publisher years ago, and just the Ghostwriters we had, it was not accurate.
[02:40:02.361 --> 02:40:03.001]  And I was like, no!
[02:40:03.342 --> 02:40:04.442]  I don't have time to write books.
[02:40:04.662 --> 02:40:10.065]  I mean, let's say I put out a book that a million people read, and I make five million dollars.
[02:40:11.686 --> 02:40:12.927]  I don't want five million dollars.
[02:40:14.988 --> 02:40:16.289]  Just to have five million dollars.
[02:40:16.309 --> 02:40:17.589]  I'm gonna put him on hold and explain this.
[02:40:17.609 --> 02:40:18.710]  I may have to go into overdrive today.
[02:40:19.971 --> 02:40:21.431]  I gotta get into this 2012 issue.
[02:40:21.451 --> 02:40:29.856]  See, you ask questions that are... But then I realize if I go do events with 5,000 people, and I land in a jet, and I show it,
[02:40:31.215 --> 02:40:35.377]  And I go out and I speak, and I get Hollywood people I know to come be part of it.
[02:40:35.837 --> 02:40:40.659]  Then the mainstream media will see it, and then I'll be anointed and seen as this big star.
[02:40:40.699 --> 02:40:43.860]  It's like you... That's why I guess if you want, I'll wear a suit and tie.
[02:40:44.480 --> 02:40:47.641]  I guess if people want me to fly on a private jet, I can go make the money to do it.
[02:40:48.021 --> 02:40:48.942]  Snap my fingers and do it.
[02:40:49.922 --> 02:40:59.206]  I mean, snap my fingers and charge people $100 to come hear me speak all day long and speak to thousands, any city, any time, boom, done it over and over again.
[02:40:59.506 --> 02:41:00.646]  But I charge, you know, $10, $20.
[02:41:00.766 --> 02:41:04.628]  And then give half the money to local radio stations, stuff like that.
[02:41:05.168 --> 02:41:11.230]  And then I abhor, it's horrifying to think of going up on a stage with 5,000 people worshipping you.
[02:41:11.715 --> 02:41:18.418]  I mean, and again, I love them, I care about them, but I get more reclusive by the day.
[02:41:18.478 --> 02:41:19.439]  I'm just going to be honest.
[02:41:20.019 --> 02:41:20.279]  Okay?
[02:41:20.359 --> 02:41:21.280]  I just don't like it.
[02:41:22.100 --> 02:41:25.582]  I want to sit around here at my office making films and doing things.
[02:41:25.602 --> 02:41:27.003]  Like, I bought real laser beams.
[02:41:28.550 --> 02:41:32.131]  And I've got something coming out nobody's done this week or next week.
[02:41:33.071 --> 02:41:35.412]  And I'm not even going to explain it to people.
[02:41:35.432 --> 02:41:37.872]  It's pretty ridiculous when you see this shit.
[02:41:38.632 --> 02:41:47.435]  Anyways, I want to... And again, you raised a point.
[02:41:47.495 --> 02:41:48.915]  It's just something I'm thinking about.
[02:41:51.294 --> 02:41:54.757]  Like, I don't think that Glenn Beck has my phones tapped, okay?
[02:41:54.937 --> 02:42:01.463]  I know for a fact from people that worked at Fox News and were in and around Mercury Media that they had guys, like five guys assigned to tracking our show and what we do.
[02:42:01.503 --> 02:42:05.246]  And I see they take what we do and change it and, you know, make it profitable and do all this stuff.
[02:42:05.286 --> 02:42:05.706]  That's fine.
[02:42:05.986 --> 02:42:07.207]  I hope Glenn Beck makes $10 billion.
[02:42:08.208 --> 02:42:14.834]  I don't like the fact that Glenn Beck, over and over again, people are like, I can't come on your show or Glenn Beck won't have me on, they say.
[02:42:16.050 --> 02:42:16.750]  Or a sponsor.
[02:42:16.790 --> 02:42:18.231]  Well, you ought to hear what Glenn Beck was saying.
[02:42:18.771 --> 02:42:20.051]  Or, you know, Fox News people.
[02:42:20.091 --> 02:42:23.192]  Well, I was going to have you on, but Glenn Beck's going to throw a fifth, you know, he says.
[02:42:24.392 --> 02:42:27.593]  Or, you know, Glenn Beck acting like I made something up about him.
[02:42:27.633 --> 02:42:34.415]  Or Glenn Beck implying that, you know, just out of the blue, you know, people said Charlie Sheen didn't go to the hospital over a hernia.
[02:42:34.695 --> 02:42:36.596]  And I happen to know that he had to go in and have surgery.
[02:42:36.616 --> 02:42:40.137]  I'd seen him when he'd had surgery on his hernia one time when he had his shirt off out at the pool.
[02:42:40.717 --> 02:42:41.938]  And I go, man, I've seen your hernia.
[02:42:41.958 --> 02:42:43.018]  You did go to the hospital because of that.
[02:42:43.319 --> 02:42:44.299]  Oh, I've seen your hernia.
[02:42:44.459 --> 02:42:46.060]  They were in the shower having sex together.
[02:42:46.320 --> 02:42:48.382]  You know, just like, man, what is your problem?
[02:42:49.202 --> 02:43:03.311]  You were saying Glenn Beck, I mean, you were saying that Ron Paul was a piece of garbage and the Army should be used against him, and there's no FEMA camps and all this stuff, you know, just three years ago, four years ago, or less.
[02:43:04.170 --> 02:43:19.871]  And then now you go co-op the Liberty Convention and all these Hollywood stars, that I happen to know were listeners of mine, because it's some of the same folks that run the whole Joe Rogan circle, that whole Hollywood troupe, and then it's doing shows with Glenn Beck.
[02:43:20.591 --> 02:43:29.534]  It's like, you try to hold me down, you try to destroy Ron Paul, and then you go get Vince Vaughn, who's this big Ron Paul supporter and starting to wake up, and go get him over for you.
[02:43:29.774 --> 02:43:31.894]  That ruins me watching your success.
[02:43:32.214 --> 02:43:45.338]  And then evil parts of me go, well, I'll just go charge $300 for people to see me speak, and I'll fly around on a private jet and show everybody, and then I'll go do all these book deals, and I'll go have an imprint, and I'll show Glenn Beck, maybe I'll, you know, I'll
[02:43:45.458 --> 02:43:46.118]  We're good to go.
[02:44:07.509 --> 02:44:13.956]  No, I've just gone off on a whole jag, because he announced tonight, I was on Drugs Report last week, on air, reading headlines, and I saw this reality show.
[02:44:14.257 --> 02:44:17.380]  Now a lot of people, I wouldn't do a reality show, they'll twist it, I'd know it's him doing his own.
[02:44:17.701 --> 02:44:18.562]  And then I started reading it.
[02:44:19.764 --> 02:44:24.206]  And I'm like, I'll be a ball-headed monkey's uncle.
[02:44:24.866 --> 02:44:33.029]  That's not the exact idea I talked about privately, but that is something I was planning on announcing January 1st, basically something similar.
[02:44:33.449 --> 02:44:46.074]  Well, you know we have contests over documentaries and contests, and I was building new studios so we could have studio audiences and looking at places to do it in Austin and things, and I'm just like, you know, I don't think they've got my phones tapped, even though
[02:44:47.134 --> 02:44:58.637]  Even though he's moved to Dallas and had people down here looking at houses in Austin near where I live and even though I know he's got five guys at least back in the old days watching what I do, it is kind of Creepville though.
[02:44:59.337 --> 02:45:05.498]  I mean, but maybe it's just that he's copied me so much and moved into the quote model we have.
[02:45:05.758 --> 02:45:09.179]  Our models just get the word out any way you can that that's what's happening.
[02:45:09.359 --> 02:45:14.660]  And see, I just went into that whole thought area of my brain because I then read the whole thing and I was like, what?
[02:45:15.779 --> 02:45:20.182]  I mean, I better just announce everything here on air before he does it.
[02:45:21.443 --> 02:45:23.444]  Because you know I started putting clothes out a few years ago.
[02:45:23.524 --> 02:45:25.706]  I was looking at designer made in America jeans.
[02:45:25.946 --> 02:45:26.787]  I guess that's common sense.
[02:45:26.807 --> 02:45:27.927]  Nobody's making jeans in America.
[02:45:27.967 --> 02:45:28.588]  Why shouldn't I?
[02:45:28.948 --> 02:45:29.989]  Boom, he does it.
[02:45:30.549 --> 02:45:31.270]  I'll just announce now.
[02:45:31.290 --> 02:45:33.131]  I'm gonna come out with Alex Jones art and prints.
[02:45:33.831 --> 02:45:37.014]  Okay, so down the road when he does it, you know, I said it first.
[02:45:37.614 --> 02:45:39.557]  You know, kind of like internet, TV, all the rest of it.
[02:45:39.577 --> 02:45:41.459]  And I'm not, you know, the truth lives here.
[02:45:41.499 --> 02:45:42.881]  Glenn, the truth doesn't live with you.
[02:45:43.301 --> 02:45:45.985]  And listen, I'm glad that he's becoming more and more Alex Jones.
[02:45:46.385 --> 02:45:48.928]  Like I said, I influence these people and that's a good thing.
[02:45:49.569 --> 02:45:51.191]  I just don't like the working against me.
[02:45:51.732 --> 02:45:53.294]  And then acting like I'm working against him.
[02:45:53.334 --> 02:45:55.337]  Now I've gone off into a pointless Glenn Beck rant.
[02:45:56.793 --> 02:45:59.475]  It's just that he tried to bring down Ron Paul as hard as he could.
[02:45:59.535 --> 02:46:00.836]  Ron Paul called him a demagogue.
[02:46:00.956 --> 02:46:06.640]  And then I happen to know that Glenn Beck, from my sources, has approached the Ron Paul camp about some stuff.
[02:46:07.320 --> 02:46:12.664]  And again, if I trusted him, if he came out and said, I'm sorry for attacking Ron Paul, I was wrong.
[02:46:13.064 --> 02:46:19.629]  And if he apologized about stuff he's done to other people like me, then I would be happy for his success.
[02:46:19.909 --> 02:46:23.952]  But let me tell you, success at my expense makes me really angry.
[02:46:25.249 --> 02:46:27.330]  I'll just leave it at that, and I'm totally ranting now.
[02:46:30.711 --> 02:46:31.531]  Okay, caller, thank you.
[02:46:31.551 --> 02:46:34.912]  I'll try to get to other callers after I cover this whole 2012 thing.
[02:46:35.472 --> 02:46:39.193]  I will say, we're going to announce something really big on Friday.
[02:46:39.253 --> 02:46:41.893]  I've got to accelerate this now because I tend to procrastinate.
[02:46:42.954 --> 02:46:46.275]  I'm going to announce something, the biggest thing we've ever done contest-wise.
[02:46:47.295 --> 02:46:49.575]  I haven't decided if it's going to be a $100,000 prize or a $200,000 prize on Friday.
[02:46:52.955 --> 02:46:54.903]  And by the way, that's just the first prize.
[02:46:57.091 --> 02:46:58.456]  I'm thinking about making it a million.
[02:47:01.758 --> 02:47:04.280]  And I gotta say it quick in case they do have my phones tapped.
[02:47:04.340 --> 02:47:07.003]  I mean, I don't have proof of that, but I mean, it's crazy.
[02:47:07.423 --> 02:47:11.366]  Or maybe the NSA gets the data and then obviously he's been a government op in the past, they give it to him.
[02:47:11.627 --> 02:47:12.587]  I mean, I can't prove that.
[02:47:12.667 --> 02:47:19.153]  I just, I've got to say everything I'm planning immediately on air now because there's nothing worse than having an idea and then somebody else does it.
[02:47:19.433 --> 02:47:21.635]  But you know, like five guys invented radio the same week.
[02:47:21.956 --> 02:47:24.037]  They all kind of just got their invention out at the same time.
[02:47:24.438 --> 02:47:25.879]  Marconi amongst them saw me in.
[02:47:25.919 --> 02:47:26.640]  That may be what it is.
[02:47:26.900 --> 02:47:27.841]  Great minds think alike.
[02:47:27.881 --> 02:47:28.982]  But let me tell you, it's getting weird.
[02:47:29.602 --> 02:47:36.444]  It's getting, I mean, just thank God he didn't get a house in Austin and got one in Dallas because that would have been, this town's not big enough for the two of us.
[02:47:37.104 --> 02:47:44.247]  Just, I mean, and I could go into the whole list of just the terms, the specials, the way we promote things, just everything.
[02:47:44.547 --> 02:47:54.230]  Here's a guy worth hundreds of millions of dollars who is literally sucking everything out of this operation and then twisting it when it comes out the other dirty end.
[02:47:54.250 --> 02:47:54.930]  All right, excuse me.
[02:47:56.357 --> 02:47:57.978]  We're going to skip this network break right here.
[02:47:57.998 --> 02:48:00.639]  I've got to do this and start over.
[02:48:00.719 --> 02:48:05.981]  See, callers bring up something and then it's like, boop, a champagne cork pops and outsprays the contents.
[02:48:06.021 --> 02:48:06.961]  They bring up something.
[02:48:08.022 --> 02:48:10.063]  And then a whole data area that I've got.
[02:48:10.083 --> 02:48:12.104]  In fact, I shouldn't even have got into that on air.
[02:48:12.204 --> 02:48:18.466]  It's just it because I get guilty, even though I know it's not envy or jealousy, because that's the worst thing for me.
[02:48:18.726 --> 02:48:20.347]  That's not big in my mind.
[02:48:23.211 --> 02:48:24.712]  It's kind of like the Jungle Song.
[02:48:24.772 --> 02:48:28.394]  You can have anything you want, but you better not take it from me.
[02:48:29.115 --> 02:48:29.515]  Know what I mean?
[02:48:30.456 --> 02:48:32.857]  All right, here we go, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:33.097 --> 02:48:34.158]  He's smiling at CJ.
[02:48:39.602 --> 02:48:40.562]  Oh, you're still blasted?
[02:48:41.223 --> 02:48:42.603]  Think it ought to be a million dollar prize?
[02:48:45.025 --> 02:48:46.886]  Well, that'll exhaust some of our funds, yeah.
[02:48:47.406 --> 02:48:48.947]  Well, it'll certainly get the word out.
[02:48:49.008 --> 02:48:52.590]  Wait till I... No, no, we need the million to fund the winner.
[02:48:53.871 --> 02:48:54.231]  You see.
[02:48:54.251 --> 02:48:58.334]  Because, see, winning the prize is just the beginning.
[02:48:59.154 --> 02:49:01.896]  Well, it's what Glenn Beck's doing, but you'll hear it from my perspective.
[02:49:02.196 --> 02:49:05.378]  What I was going to do, what I told people about, you know, hey, we ought to do this.
[02:49:05.398 --> 02:49:06.419]  It doesn't matter.
[02:49:06.959 --> 02:49:10.522]  I'm sure there's no surveillance of this operation.
[02:49:11.843 --> 02:49:15.685]  I'm sure the system wouldn't create a counterfeit.
[02:49:17.025 --> 02:49:24.469]  I'm sure that I go out on the street and almost every person I walk by is now a listener or watches us online one way or another.
[02:49:24.969 --> 02:49:27.450]  I'm sure that no one's co-opting that.
[02:49:28.370 --> 02:49:29.391]  I'm sure that's happening.
[02:49:35.888 --> 02:49:36.748]  And folks, you know me.
[02:49:36.868 --> 02:49:38.789]  I don't get up here and bash on Limbaugh.
[02:49:39.009 --> 02:49:40.569]  I don't get up here and bash on Savage.
[02:49:41.289 --> 02:49:42.449]  I don't get up and bash these guys.
[02:49:42.469 --> 02:49:45.670]  Sometimes, you know, when Limbaugh's saying, arrest people that do drugs, I'm like, come on, dude.
[02:49:46.350 --> 02:49:47.310]  He doesn't do that as much now.
[02:49:47.330 --> 02:49:48.650]  I'm like, come on, that's pretty hypocritical.
[02:49:49.291 --> 02:49:50.971]  But I'm not in competition with him.
[02:49:51.331 --> 02:49:55.352]  But Glenn Beck has taken this really creepy interest in me and has tried to hurt me.
[02:49:57.172 --> 02:50:01.913]  And I don't want to hurt Glenn Beck, but
[02:50:03.968 --> 02:50:11.933]  I am close to really making a short film about him that will go directly at your audience, which is my audience.
[02:50:12.634 --> 02:50:17.977]  So I know you're all about dollars and cents, buddy, who brags about, you know, hanging out with Bill Gates or whatever.
[02:50:18.017 --> 02:50:19.318]  I'll get you didn't say his name on air.
[02:50:19.718 --> 02:50:22.400]  The point is, just get off my back.
[02:50:23.040 --> 02:50:24.141]  I'm telling you right now.
[02:50:25.041 --> 02:50:28.604]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, let's go ahead and get into
[02:50:30.885 --> 02:50:35.948]  Let's get into what's happening with the Mayan calendar.
[02:50:36.909 --> 02:50:42.353]  First off, let me get to this report right here on the document cam for viewers.
[02:50:43.574 --> 02:50:50.978]  David Stewart is in the top four or five Mayanists, as they're called, in the United States.
[02:50:50.998 --> 02:50:52.359]  He's at the University of Texas.
[02:50:52.900 --> 02:50:57.983]  He ciphers meaning of newly discovered monument that refers to 2012.
[02:51:00.663 --> 02:51:04.304]  And it says Mayan used to date simply as a literary device.
[02:51:04.424 --> 02:51:10.685]  He grew up with parents that were archaeologists in the Yucatan Peninsula and the basin there in Mexico City and other areas.
[02:51:12.006 --> 02:51:25.929]  He is world-renowned Mayanist archaeologist and he says it is simply the date to mean a new calendar begins or the end of an age or a new hearth to be lit.
[02:51:27.386 --> 02:51:28.407]  Meaning a new sunrise.
[02:51:28.467 --> 02:51:45.044]  Now, it's funny he says this on the University of Texas website, because I've been down to the archaeological sites, I've gone to local museums, I've sat there with Mayan archaeologists, who are Mayan, and they've told me, no, none of this is true, it's made up by people in the 60s in the U.S., all it means is a new hearth.
[02:51:45.124 --> 02:51:49.769]  So, even if you believe that it's going to be the end of the world,
[02:51:53.260 --> 02:51:58.063]  You have to understand that the Mayans never said that and never meant that.
[02:51:58.484 --> 02:52:13.714]  And the mainstream media hyping and pushing all of this, they know that it's all about just giving people something to cop out about.
[02:52:14.695 --> 02:52:18.338]  So that, oh, I'm not going to get involved, it's the end of the world anyways, and I've gone over this over and over again.
[02:52:18.698 --> 02:52:22.501]  And the people promoting all of this, you know, I'm just not doing this justice here.
[02:52:23.223 --> 02:52:26.765]  Because I know I'm running out of time, then I try to hurry up, and then I don't get to it all.
[02:52:27.205 --> 02:52:44.172]  Paul Watson's article is up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, but the point is, the people say it's Planet X, the people say it's Nibiru gonna hit us, they say it's a comet, a meteor shower, a galactic plane, a pole shift, and it's all pure bull.
[02:52:44.392 --> 02:52:50.375]  But here's the big message, there could be a pole shift, there could be a giant asteroid hit us someday, there could be
[02:52:51.195 --> 02:52:52.356]  A tectonic event.
[02:52:52.396 --> 02:52:58.601]  The sun could send out a super flare and hit the earth and burn one side of it to a crisp.
[02:52:59.682 --> 02:53:01.944]  And it would take hundreds of millions of years to come back, if ever.
[02:53:02.244 --> 02:53:04.186]  I mean, all of this is real threats.
[02:53:04.967 --> 02:53:11.592]  But we can never address the real threats of x-ray lasers and particle beams and the Hadron Superconducting Super Collider.
[02:53:11.933 --> 02:53:15.596]  We can never address any of this type stuff.
[02:53:16.937 --> 02:53:26.241]  Because we are always so busy hearing it's the rapture, or it's the end of the world, Mayan calendar, and it's all pure bull.
[02:53:28.302 --> 02:53:31.943]  And that's what I had to say on that subject, and I'll get more into it after I take some of your calls.
[02:53:32.063 --> 02:53:34.224]  And then I'll read over some of the real threats.
[02:53:34.324 --> 02:53:35.685]  Our article gets into real threats.
[02:53:36.950 --> 02:53:43.574]  To humanity on the subject of my thought process of why the guy called up and said why aren't you doing that gun show anymore?
[02:53:44.134 --> 02:54:01.043]  You know seen by millions of people only did two episodes very popular very successful Already had people calling up wanting to give us national gun shows right out of the gates as I knew what happened that's a question if we would even do that and
[02:54:03.939 --> 02:54:08.762]  You have all that stuff going on, and I'm like, yeah, but a gun show would just make money.
[02:54:09.382 --> 02:54:10.723]  And I don't want to just make money.
[02:54:10.983 --> 02:54:14.885]  But then the argument is, well, if you make a bunch of money, then you can spend it on other projects.
[02:54:15.325 --> 02:54:21.028]  And it's just that I enjoy fighting the globalists and covering things more than I do just making money.
[02:54:21.428 --> 02:54:30.259]  But then there's the issue of, then I've got to spend all day promoting other things to make money, so I need to make as much money as I can to really get in the face of the globalists, so maybe that's the answer.
[02:54:30.600 --> 02:54:32.502]  But then to do that, you've got to put on airs.
[02:54:32.542 --> 02:54:33.804]  You've got to act arrogant.
[02:54:34.204 --> 02:54:36.427]  You've got to act powerful in front of people.
[02:54:37.689 --> 02:54:54.422]  I mean, so much of this is like ooga-booga tribal stuff, where you've got to strut around with an entourage of police, and you've got to get off the private jet, and you've got to court Hollywood people, which I can certainly do, and get them to come out for you, and you've got to play ball.
[02:54:55.003 --> 02:55:00.928]  Well, I don't want to just play ball so I can be, you know, get out there, because that will distort my message.
[02:55:02.631 --> 02:55:05.475]  But yes, you know, maybe I should do the book deals.
[02:55:06.677 --> 02:55:07.898]  Maybe I should.
[02:55:08.439 --> 02:55:12.265]  See, the one thing I did decide to do, and I'll tell you about it on Friday.
[02:55:14.039 --> 02:55:35.979]  The one thing I did decide to do is get a bunch of filmmakers together, because I make great documentaries that have been very successful, but I just don't have time running everything and doing radio and news to do it, and getting filmmakers together, because I know and have the sources in Hollywood, in spades, to actually get films into theaters in a test, have them sell out, then they go to more screens.
[02:55:36.299 --> 02:55:39.042]  See, what happened is, when I watched Dinesh D'Souza,
[02:55:39.742 --> 02:55:43.085]  Do that, and make $20 million off a film that I could do better than.
[02:55:43.145 --> 02:55:44.146]  It was still well done.
[02:55:44.166 --> 02:55:46.267]  I don't agree with the premise, the whole premise of it.
[02:55:46.287 --> 02:55:48.049]  Obama's a globalist, not an anti-colonialist.
[02:55:48.329 --> 02:55:51.491]  He's an anti-traditional colonialist, and then he wants global banker.
[02:55:52.132 --> 02:55:53.072]  Balkanization.
[02:55:53.112 --> 02:55:57.516]  Like, you balkanize the countries and play them off against each other, but have an overall overreaching globalism above it.
[02:55:58.316 --> 02:56:06.283]  I said, you know, well, okay, we need to come out and actually find the filmmakers, and maybe produce three films a year.
[02:56:07.063 --> 02:56:14.430]  And put them on the circuit and pay them money, because you've got to pay money, up front to get them in the right theaters and get them promoted.
[02:56:16.131 --> 02:56:21.696]  I mean, I could take films with $500,000 budgets and just put another $500,000 on promotion.
[02:56:21.956 --> 02:56:24.718]  Guaranteed, even if they were, quote, failures, they'd make $5 million.
[02:56:26.445 --> 02:56:34.155]  And so I was already planning to launch all this, and I'm sure Beck went and also, you know, smart guy, saw that and is going with that.
[02:56:34.316 --> 02:56:35.517]  But my model's better.
[02:56:36.318 --> 02:56:38.301]  My model's much better and much quicker.
[02:56:38.841 --> 02:56:42.446]  So there'll be a race now to see who can get these films out the fastest.
[02:56:43.047 --> 02:56:43.508]  And the best.
[02:56:44.747 --> 02:56:45.508]  So, that's it.
[02:56:46.008 --> 02:56:46.809]  That's what's going on.
[02:56:47.069 --> 02:56:59.702]  And, you know, with Beck, you'll get a Dinesh D'Souza, the Republicans are going to save us, Obama's a, you know, communist from Kenya, or a guy originally from Kenya but born here, but roots in Kenya, who just doesn't like capitalism and freedom.
[02:57:00.433 --> 02:57:05.400]  No, he's a mega bank front guy who wants to shut down all their competition and carry out eugenics in the third world.
[02:57:05.760 --> 02:57:08.764]  Posing as an anti-colonialist to sell and fool people.
[02:57:09.285 --> 02:57:12.389]  You know, and saying they're behind the Arab Spring to liberate people when it's to put radicals in.
[02:57:13.510 --> 02:57:15.553]  So I kind of got off into that whole thought process.
[02:57:15.833 --> 02:57:18.276]  But on Friday, we will make the announcement.
[02:57:19.005 --> 02:57:19.926]  We'll make the announcement.
[02:57:20.446 --> 02:57:23.368]  The one reason I procrastinated is you start getting into millions of dollars.
[02:57:23.788 --> 02:57:24.928]  I gotta go to the lawyers.
[02:57:25.349 --> 02:57:32.933]  I gotta make, because we've paid out on every contest, we've had like 20 of them or more, for films and documentaries and short films and promos and activism.
[02:57:33.574 --> 02:57:38.897]  But when I do this, you know, this is a, I gotta, again, I've been talking about it for about three, four months.
[02:57:42.597 --> 02:57:49.040]  It's the way to go, because if something will make a ton of money, which I can put back into the fight, and reach millions, now that's where I'm at.
[02:57:49.500 --> 02:57:58.424]  See, a book that gets read by a million people, and that's about as big as they get in non-fiction, that makes you five million dollars, the person, the author.
[02:58:00.485 --> 02:58:02.406]  I don't care about the $5 million.
[02:58:02.486 --> 02:58:03.566]  I care about a million people.
[02:58:04.046 --> 02:58:09.868]  Well, if I can put out a 10-minute video, take the one with my son, uh, The Secret Terrorists Don't Want You To Know.
[02:58:10.488 --> 02:58:11.088]  Just Google that.
[02:58:11.108 --> 02:58:13.529]  I'm gonna have it posted back on the front page of InfoWars.com.
[02:58:14.149 --> 02:58:16.790]  That'll probably end up getting seen by 500,000 people.
[02:58:17.670 --> 02:58:19.071]  A year from now, probably it'll be a million.
[02:58:20.123 --> 02:58:24.264]  See, it makes me no money, but it reaches a million people.
[02:58:24.664 --> 02:58:25.965]  Put me in that briar patch all day.
[02:58:25.985 --> 02:58:27.525]  See, I want hearts and minds.
[02:58:27.665 --> 02:58:28.685]  I want to defeat the globalists.
[02:58:29.205 --> 02:58:30.026]  Okay, you understand that?
[02:58:30.386 --> 02:58:32.766]  I'm happy in my four-bedroom house.
[02:58:33.327 --> 02:58:36.187]  I don't want a 20-bedroom house or a helicopter.
[02:58:36.568 --> 02:58:37.268]  You understand the difference?
[02:58:37.388 --> 02:58:39.128]  I want to defeat the New World Order.
[02:58:43.970 --> 02:58:47.050]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:59:56.207 --> 02:59:59.428]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:14.532 --> 03:00:29.506]  What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna shoot a video on the Watson article that we put together dealing with 2012 not being the end of the world and then I will play that on the show in the next few days.
[03:00:31.512 --> 03:00:39.034]  We're also going to premiere, probably tonight, if not on the radio tomorrow, the video and audio of my confrontation down at the Federal Building last week.
[03:00:39.074 --> 03:00:40.275]  We just had so much on our plate.
[03:00:40.615 --> 03:00:43.095]  I'm going to try to hire more video editors, more researchers.
[03:00:43.115 --> 03:00:43.836]  Then we've got to train them.
[03:00:43.856 --> 03:00:46.296]  Because I'm just trying to throw everything at the globalists right now.
[03:00:46.316 --> 03:00:48.477]  Because everything we do is hitting the zeitgeist.
[03:00:48.497 --> 03:00:53.318]  But we just need to absolutely maximize as much damage to the globalists as we can.
[03:00:53.739 --> 03:00:54.939]  And that's by waking people up.
[03:00:55.119 --> 03:00:57.080]  Andrew in Oregon, thanks for putting up with me.
[03:00:57.100 --> 03:00:58.060]  You're on the air.
[03:00:58.100 --> 03:00:58.480]  Go ahead.
[03:01:01.246 --> 03:01:03.508]  Hey buddy, you got your music turned up in the background.
[03:01:03.528 --> 03:01:04.829]  You're listening on the internet, you must be.
[03:01:04.849 --> 03:01:09.613]  I will put him on hold or get rid of him.
[03:01:09.653 --> 03:01:10.114]  I'm sorry.
[03:01:10.154 --> 03:01:11.355]  Hollywood and propaganda.
[03:01:11.715 --> 03:01:12.676]  Josh in Indiana.
[03:01:12.696 --> 03:01:16.859]  That's like saying a bear does bad things in the woods with its little... Go ahead.
[03:01:16.879 --> 03:01:20.863]  Hey brother, how we doing?
[03:01:21.003 --> 03:01:26.388]  I had a quick news item from 1919 that I wanted to run by and get your analysis if I could.
[03:01:26.408 --> 03:01:27.328]  That sounds pretty evil.
[03:01:27.348 --> 03:01:27.629]  Go ahead.
[03:01:28.775 --> 03:01:29.877]  We're good to go.
[03:01:42.429 --> 03:01:53.740]  Members of Congress and motion picture executives, they passed a resolution that the American motion picture industry do all that is within its power to up-build and strengthen the spirit of Americanism within our people.
[03:01:54.461 --> 03:02:00.067]  The prime mover in the new campaign is Secretary of the Interior Franklin K. Lane, who expressed to the movie mobiles
[03:02:00.856 --> 03:02:01.376]  No, no, that's right.
[03:02:01.416 --> 03:02:07.139]  Again, the megabanks, and this is on record, funded Lennon in a 1917-1918 takeover, then used that threat to take over the media in the name of countering the threat.
[03:02:16.122 --> 03:02:17.263]  Do you understand how that works?
[03:02:17.303 --> 03:02:23.325]  Just like Emperor Palpatine, as a senator, attacks his own planet to get more power to become chancellor.
[03:02:23.345 --> 03:02:28.687]  Then he attacks the capital planet to become emperor to meet the threat he's engineered.
[03:02:29.048 --> 03:02:31.529]  Again, a children's movie explaining how this really works.
[03:02:31.569 --> 03:02:31.809]  Yes.
[03:02:31.829 --> 03:02:33.750]  Absolutely, sir.
[03:02:33.770 --> 03:02:34.490]  Bread and circus.
[03:02:34.890 --> 03:02:35.590]  Bread and circus.
[03:02:36.011 --> 03:02:39.032]  Oh, I mean, Hollywood has been government-run since it started.
[03:02:39.984 --> 03:02:40.985]  And that is when it was started.
[03:02:41.025 --> 03:02:41.406]  It was in 1919.
[03:02:41.726 --> 03:02:44.129]  You've actually done your homework, my friend.
[03:02:44.389 --> 03:02:45.110]  What is that out of?
[03:02:45.130 --> 03:02:45.811]  The New York Times?
[03:02:46.792 --> 03:02:47.273]  You know what?
[03:02:47.353 --> 03:02:48.534]  I got this out of a book.
[03:02:48.674 --> 03:02:53.640]  My mom used to make books at a bindery, and it's called Chronicle of the 20th Century.
[03:02:54.358 --> 03:03:00.842]  And it was another best book in 1987, and it's just a chronological order of just major news headlines.
[03:03:01.142 --> 03:03:06.245]  And if you're a lick and you got eyes of sea, man, it just, you connect the dots all the way up to 87.
[03:03:06.965 --> 03:03:07.866]  And it's really something.
[03:03:07.886 --> 03:03:11.107]  I mean, it's got Rob Trout in here, Rockefeller, all his dirty deeds.
[03:03:11.147 --> 03:03:15.610]  Like, this next page earlier says, Rockefeller beats own record for giving.
[03:03:15.830 --> 03:03:16.650]  This was the same day.
[03:03:16.670 --> 03:03:17.951]  No, no, listen, listen, listen, listen.
[03:03:17.971 --> 03:03:18.671]  I'm going to tell you this.
[03:03:18.772 --> 03:03:19.332]  I appreciate your call.
[03:03:19.352 --> 03:03:22.153]  We were over at my grandmother's house, uh, Saturday.
[03:03:22.193 --> 03:03:22.654]  Went to see her.
[03:03:23.871 --> 03:03:28.183]  And the kids are over there and we brought our Chinese food and we're sitting there and a knock on the door.
[03:03:29.306 --> 03:03:32.827]  And it's the Nature Conservancy, total CIA Rockefeller created.
[03:03:33.127 --> 03:03:34.307]  I tell the woman that, close the door.
[03:03:34.547 --> 03:03:36.247]  My wife opens National Geographic.
[03:03:36.287 --> 03:03:44.569]  It's the human genome global track that's really to get the racial lines so they can use bioweapons to take out certain races because they're worried because everybody's in her bread.
[03:03:44.909 --> 03:03:46.870]  That's a globalist Rockefeller funded thing.
[03:03:47.090 --> 03:03:48.350]  And then we open another magazine.
[03:03:48.390 --> 03:03:49.610]  It's a Rockefeller funded deal.
[03:03:50.070 --> 03:03:53.371]  They created over 50 organizations to set up world government.
[03:03:53.591 --> 03:03:56.472]  They set up the UN and they're just Rothschild fronts.
[03:03:56.512 --> 03:03:57.032]  Great point.
[03:03:57.112 --> 03:03:57.792]  I mean, it's just
[03:03:58.092 --> 03:03:58.872]  They're everywhere!
[03:03:58.892 --> 03:03:59.873]  They're attacking us!
[03:03:59.953 --> 03:04:01.133]  They've created all this!
[03:04:02.054 --> 03:04:03.715]  I want to hear from Gary in New York.
[03:04:03.775 --> 03:04:05.435]  CNBC report on Obama.
[03:04:05.736 --> 03:04:06.276]  What'd they say?

[03:04:07.236 --> 03:04:07.897]  We're almost out of time.
[03:04:16.280 --> 03:04:18.301]  I think Gary's playing a clip off the news.
[03:04:18.321 --> 03:04:19.041]  We're out of time.
[03:04:19.201 --> 03:04:20.602]  I'm obnoxious with these calls.
[03:04:21.042 --> 03:04:22.502]  I get so wound up, folks.

[03:04:28.584 --> 03:04:31.105]  I've just got to break my... I'm totally neurotic.
[03:04:31.185 --> 03:04:32.966]  I just cannot get to a bunch of calls.
[03:04:33.266 --> 03:04:39.748]  Because if I do get to a caller, then if you do get to me, you're ready for an hour of just verbal fire hosing.
[03:04:39.768 --> 03:04:41.669]  Because it's like flipping a switch.
[03:04:42.509 --> 03:04:44.812]  I'm gonna try to regroup, refocus.
[03:04:44.832 --> 03:04:46.073]  I got a bunch of reports to shoot.
