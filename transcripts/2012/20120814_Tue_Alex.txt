[00:00:04.912 --> 00:00:09.755]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.755 --> 00:00:11.336]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.336 --> 00:00:12.877]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.877 --> 00:00:17.079]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:21.141]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:37.721]  Well, we've got a big kahuna of a transmission for you today.
[00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:39.782]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:00:39.782 --> 00:00:43.123]  It is the 14th day of August 2012.
[00:00:43.123 --> 00:00:50.045]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and we are going to be live here for the next three hours at least.
[00:00:50.045 --> 00:00:58.568]  And coming up, one of our favorite guests chronicling the insanity of the collectivist class and the crony globalists that sit perched on top of it.
[00:01:00.731 --> 00:01:03.432]  Lou Rockwell will be joining us coming up in the third hour.
[00:01:03.432 --> 00:01:10.336]  We will have open phones for the balance of the transmission, including when Lou Rockwell is on with us.
[00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:11.496]  So I guess the whole thing.
[00:01:11.496 --> 00:01:14.598]  But the first two hours and then with Lou Rockwell as well.
[00:01:14.598 --> 00:01:15.518]  Wow!
[00:01:15.518 --> 00:01:25.223]  Yesterday we reported on the 1.4 billion rounds of .40 caliber and other calibers purchased by the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:01:27.217 --> 00:01:29.459]  They bought 250 million rounds last year.
[00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:32.622]  About five months ago, they bought 450 million rounds.
[00:01:32.622 --> 00:01:37.786]  They're buying 750 million rounds, buying up many calibers, but 40 is the main one.
[00:01:37.786 --> 00:01:39.487]  That was announced last week.
[00:01:39.487 --> 00:01:40.648]  We reported on it yesterday.
[00:01:40.648 --> 00:01:48.794]  Now our story today is the top right-hand link, or at least it was 10 minutes ago, at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:01:48.794 --> 00:01:51.296]  National Weather Service in huge ammo buy.
[00:01:51.296 --> 00:01:54.819]  The Weather Service is buying
[00:01:56.783 --> 00:02:10.328]  Buying a whole bunch of ammo on top of the $1.4 billion just for the Department of Homeland Security itself.
[00:02:10.328 --> 00:02:13.629]  So we are going to be going over that today.
[00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:18.571]  And I'm going to discuss the fact that we are already under martial law.
[00:02:20.373 --> 00:02:45.524]  When the IRS can take your bank account with no due process, when the TSA can grope your wife and your children in front of you, when drones are attacking foreign countries outside of international and national law, when the President tells Congress that the UN and NATO are over them, when the government is publicly funding Al-Qaeda and saying that gun owners and libertarians and returning veterans are the number one threat,
[00:02:46.184 --> 00:02:52.806]  When Obama's talking about signing executive orders to restrict guns and take over the internet?
[00:02:52.806 --> 00:02:57.028]  When they're putting smart meters on our houses that spy on us?
[00:02:57.028 --> 00:02:58.569]  And that can go on and on and on.
[00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.770]  That's what you associate with an authoritarian system.
[00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:10.053]  All over the country they're running police and military and DHS and combos of those checkpoints.
[00:03:10.053 --> 00:03:13.414]  Okay, unless you're in a civil emergency declared by the governor,
[00:03:14.628 --> 00:03:17.631]  Or the president, and in case you didn't know, that's martial law.
[00:03:17.631 --> 00:03:22.216]  When the governor says, I'm declaring a state of emergency, that's martial law, boys and girls.
[00:03:22.216 --> 00:03:27.902]  That's how they have the troops patrolling around when an area has wildfires or whatever, or people are looting a city, the military shows up.
[00:03:27.902 --> 00:03:31.786]  Problem is, they usually end up looting because they're under federal command.
[00:03:31.786 --> 00:03:33.087]  That's called martial law.
[00:03:33.087 --> 00:03:34.208]  They don't use that name.
[00:03:35.236 --> 00:03:40.898]  Like, if somebody hits you in the head, you can call it being assaulted, you can call it being mugged.
[00:03:40.898 --> 00:03:48.141]  If somebody hits you in the head with a tire iron to rob you, it's robbery, mugging, armed robbery, assault with a deadly weapon.
[00:03:48.141 --> 00:03:50.942]  You can give it lots of names.
[00:03:50.942 --> 00:03:56.204]  I'm calling it assault with a deadly weapon with intent to rob, intent to commit felony,
[00:03:57.383 --> 00:04:02.387]  You could call it being mubbed if you like, but why debate semantics back and forth here?
[00:04:02.387 --> 00:04:08.071]  So no, I'm not saying martial law is coming in October, late October, early November.
[00:04:08.071 --> 00:04:10.312]  I'm saying we're already in it.
[00:04:10.312 --> 00:04:24.883]  And in the news, and in police sources we have, and you've heard them call in, but I have them off air, and when I'm talking to the cop face to face, senior police, they're being told get ready for all hell to break loose in late October, early November.
[00:04:24.883 --> 00:04:26.164]  Gee, what's that, the election?
[00:04:27.347 --> 00:04:32.910]  I don't know if that's going to happen, but you see the news of banks told to get ready to prevent collapses.
[00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.551]  You see parts of Europe on fire.
[00:04:34.551 --> 00:04:37.852]  A lot is happening.
[00:04:37.852 --> 00:04:46.017]  You know, all the ships mashing, the proxy wars, the LIBOR scandal.
[00:04:46.017 --> 00:04:47.417]  We're entering a very crazy time.
[00:04:47.417 --> 00:04:48.998]  We're going to break it all down when we come back.
[00:04:48.998 --> 00:04:51.680]  This is a big broadcast today.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.200]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.236 --> 00:05:06.401]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:09.363]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[00:05:09.363 --> 00:05:14.747]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[00:05:14.747 --> 00:05:19.711]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[00:05:19.711 --> 00:05:27.016]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods or meat foods direct now.
[00:05:27.336 --> 00:05:31.218]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices, too.
[00:05:31.218 --> 00:05:32.998]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[00:05:32.998 --> 00:05:37.020]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.941]  You know about their delicious, long-term, storable foods.
[00:05:39.941 --> 00:05:42.722]  The fact is, you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[00:05:42.722 --> 00:05:47.264]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[00:05:47.264 --> 00:05:47.924]  Don't wait!
[00:05:47.924 --> 00:05:49.825]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:05:49.825 --> 00:05:49.965]  Call 800-409-5633.

[00:06:10.793 --> 00:06:11.774]  Why spend more?

[00:06:19.797 --> 00:06:20.338]  Yes, only $37.95.
[00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:21.258]  That's 70% less than our competitors.
[00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:27.341]  You could buy three Survival Seed Vaults for less than one of theirs.
[00:06:27.341 --> 00:06:33.986]  The Survival Seed Vault from MyPatriotSupply.com includes detailed planting and seed saving instructions and ships same day.
[00:06:33.986 --> 00:06:36.828]  Plus, all orders over $49 ship free.

[00:07:24.002 --> 00:07:24.643]  I think?
[00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:06.431]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.431 --> 00:08:08.193]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.193 --> 00:08:09.954]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:09.954 --> 00:08:11.535]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.535 --> 00:08:13.096]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.096 --> 00:08:17.279]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.279 --> 00:08:21.362]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:45.732]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live and blasting out worldwide.
[00:08:45.732 --> 00:08:52.816]  I am your host Alex Jones, and it is Tuesday, the 14th day of August 2012.
[00:08:52.816 --> 00:08:58.840]  We are going to be here for at least the next three hours, and we are going to be covering massively
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.520]  Important news.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:13.886]  Lew Rockwell, Ron Paul's former chief of staff, and of course the head of the Von Mise Institute, is going to be joining us coming up in the third hour today.
[00:09:13.886 --> 00:09:21.248]  Here are just some of the headlines right now at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:09:21.248 --> 00:09:27.231]  An article that Paul Watson and I have been working on for the last week is now up by Alex Jones and Paul Watson.
[00:09:28.706 --> 00:09:32.088]  Rome burned, will we?
[00:09:32.088 --> 00:09:34.750]  Rome burned, will we?
[00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:40.274]  We're going to be reading over some of that article coming up in the next hour.
[00:09:40.274 --> 00:09:47.819]  National Weather Service follows Department of Homeland Security's purchase of 1.4 billion rounds of ammo in the last year.
[00:09:47.819 --> 00:09:52.081]  The latest purchase, 750 million rounds.
[00:09:52.081 --> 00:09:55.544]  With its own massive purchase of firearms ammo.
[00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.021]  The National Weather Service, that's right.
[00:09:59.021 --> 00:10:07.766]  12-gauge, .308, .223, .40 cal, 9mm, SIG, everything they need.
[00:10:07.766 --> 00:10:11.929]  Every agency arming in a lustful hate of the people.
[00:10:11.929 --> 00:10:15.171]  Because they all know they're collaborators working for foreign banks.
[00:10:15.171 --> 00:10:17.572]  Continuing, face deals.
[00:10:17.572 --> 00:10:20.153]  Scan your face for customized deals.
[00:10:20.153 --> 00:10:22.575]  This is how the Gulag Prison Casino works.
[00:10:24.031 --> 00:10:27.994]  As we predicted many years ago, Max Keiser and many others have broken down.
[00:10:27.994 --> 00:10:47.751]  You will go into a store and to waive your rights and be face scanned to buy and sell, this has always been the plan, you will waive your rights and then, because you waive your rights, you will be given a discount.
[00:10:47.751 --> 00:10:50.914]  That's ahead of everyone having to face scan to buy and sell.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:57.683]  That's why the British government is saying it's a sign of terrorism if you're not on Facebook.
[00:10:57.683 --> 00:11:05.766]  And they're now encouraging people on Facebook to upload their friends and family on there, even if they're not members.
[00:11:05.766 --> 00:11:10.749]  Remember what the head of Facebook called his users that trust him, dumb bleepers.
[00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:19.439]  Now you heard about New York launching this new Homeland Security funded system that London and Berlin and other major cities already have.
[00:11:19.439 --> 00:11:26.025]  It's face scanning software hooked into all the merchants who are later given tax exemptions if they wire in.
[00:11:27.011 --> 00:11:38.059]  But it's the tens of thousands of cameras government runs, and the hundreds of thousands of cameras within shops and without, running face scanning, license plate reading, and other classified systems.
[00:11:38.059 --> 00:11:49.887]  Infrared, PRINCE, they're also running behavioral quack scans, so they can basically have lots of little lights going off inside the command centers, saying people are terrorists.
[00:11:52.148 --> 00:12:13.895]  This is the new system, so that when you go in a store, those cameras hanging up in a Walmart, or a Target, or even the mom and pop, they're all wired in live time, and everyone's gonna wanna do it, because you go in and Facebook recognizes, and you have your little iPhone, your little digital slave tracker, or your little droid, it pops up with a message.
[00:12:13.895 --> 00:12:17.596]  In fact, we have the video, we'll play it in a moment with audio, as they're promoting this.
[00:12:17.596 --> 00:12:19.137]  A little message pops up,
[00:12:20.819 --> 00:12:24.940]  And says, oh, you're going to get a discount on that drink.
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:28.081]  That Jack Daniels, in this particular case.
[00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:33.803]  And of course, what's happening here is they're associating with party party.
[00:12:33.803 --> 00:12:45.526]  Get the implantable digital angel microchip six years ago and get into the topless bars cheaper in Miami and Fort Lauderdale and Madrid and London.
[00:12:45.526 --> 00:12:49.927]  Get into the upper VIP champagne lounge where
[00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.811]  Little Susie does a number on you.
[00:12:53.811 --> 00:12:55.673]  It's really prostitution.
[00:12:55.673 --> 00:12:59.635]  Go in the private champagne area and close the drapes.
[00:12:59.635 --> 00:13:05.259]  But to get into the champagne area, see Little Susie, you've got to take a chip.
[00:13:05.259 --> 00:13:06.540]  Oh, it's so much fun.
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:10.143]  Party, party, party, party.
[00:13:10.143 --> 00:13:11.884]  And they're not going to ask in the future.
[00:13:13.544 --> 00:13:15.345]  That's why they have gun buybacks worldwide.
[00:13:15.345 --> 00:13:15.825]  They admit it.
[00:13:15.825 --> 00:13:28.490]  The image of people lined up, turning guns into police, and the news reporting on it like guns are illegal, and billboards showing revolvers and handguns saying, report illegal guns to create the perception.
[00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:37.973]  That's why they hate it when you do open carry, which is legal and lawful in almost every state and city and county in this country, except for a few crime boss driven areas like New York and Chicago.
[00:13:37.973 --> 00:13:39.714]  They want to convert the rest of the country to their model.
[00:13:41.564 --> 00:13:44.745]  That's why the police used to arrest people for even a rifle in their car.
[00:13:44.745 --> 00:13:48.366]  It's to create that illusion that we're not allowed to own guns.
[00:13:48.366 --> 00:13:50.427]  But we're overthrowing that illusion.
[00:13:50.427 --> 00:14:09.153]  But this technocratic grid, with Google now demanding your phone number, your information, your email, all synced to your name if you're going to have any type of Google account, Google blog, YouTube, so they can then turn you off from the web if they claim you get three strikes.
[00:14:10.359 --> 00:14:12.640]  We just had this happen with one of our videos.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:26.469]  They put a strike on it, or put a copyright claim on it, saying that my voice is not owned by me, and claiming that some English record company now owned my voice.
[00:14:26.469 --> 00:14:33.093]  The English record company said, no, we didn't mean for your bots to say you owned Alex Jones's voice.
[00:14:33.093 --> 00:14:34.534]  It's an error.
[00:14:34.534 --> 00:14:38.156]  YouTube removed the claim of their fraudulent bot.
[00:14:39.938 --> 00:14:41.660]  And put a strike against us.
[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:49.029]  So, proved we were right, removed the copyright claim, but then gave us a strike.
[00:14:49.029 --> 00:14:51.772]  And we, for community guidelines of deceptiveness.
[00:14:53.058 --> 00:14:56.862]  And so we appealed it, and instantly the message came back.
[00:14:56.862 --> 00:14:58.523]  Before that person looked at it.
[00:14:58.523 --> 00:15:00.465]  We always had these overturned.
[00:15:00.465 --> 00:15:02.968]  And said, no, we stand by this.
[00:15:02.968 --> 00:15:04.489]  Well, I've got you now.
[00:15:04.489 --> 00:15:15.160]  And I know you're a big monolithic NSA front, so you pretty much have immunity, but I'm very busy launching a bunch of stuff right now, but we know you're moving towards suspending all our big channels that reach hundreds of millions a year.
[00:15:16.542 --> 00:15:25.268]  So, publicly, I'm letting everybody know that I'm going to have to get in touch with the Electronic Freedom Foundation, the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
[00:15:25.268 --> 00:15:28.470]  I'm going to have to get in touch with a bunch of... I mean, I know law.
[00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:31.412]  I know deceptive advertising, false trade practices.
[00:15:31.412 --> 00:15:35.354]  I mean, Google's in trouble stealing people's passcodes with wireless snoop systems.
[00:15:35.354 --> 00:15:39.617]  It's not the don't-be-evil front and, oh, their guys play ping pong all day and drink beer.
[00:15:39.617 --> 00:15:43.639]  That's their PR front, like Warren Buffett eating ice cream cones.
[00:15:43.639 --> 00:15:44.780]  Oh, look, I eat an ice cream cone.
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:45.501]  I'm non-threatening.
[00:15:46.241 --> 00:15:49.447]  Or all this PR where Bill Gates is Superman wanting to save you.
[00:15:49.447 --> 00:15:51.490]  They talk to you like you're children.
[00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:53.774]  You advertise it as an open community commons.
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:58.203]  Where if you follow these rules, your stuff can be up there.
[00:15:58.203 --> 00:15:59.804]  We give you the content.
[00:15:59.804 --> 00:16:05.289]  I send people off PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com and all my other big outlets.
[00:16:05.289 --> 00:16:05.990]  I send it.
[00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:09.953]  Now there's the Examiner covering it, Alex Jones Channel, Targeted Determination by YouTube.
[00:16:09.953 --> 00:16:11.614]  See, it's already making the press.
[00:16:11.614 --> 00:16:12.195]  Because it should.
[00:16:12.195 --> 00:16:14.097]  We should all hang together and hang separate.
[00:16:14.097 --> 00:16:15.198]  You advertise this.
[00:16:15.198 --> 00:16:16.979]  I go follow your rules.
[00:16:16.979 --> 00:16:20.522]  I say, hey, don't put a copyright claim on us.
[00:16:21.463 --> 00:16:25.285]  I've got to defend my voice and the voices of my guests.
[00:16:25.285 --> 00:16:28.566]  Suddenly, we're getting copyright claims when I have Joe Rogan on.
[00:16:28.566 --> 00:16:31.027]  That's not his intention.
[00:16:31.027 --> 00:16:32.187]  I'm getting them with other guests.
[00:16:32.187 --> 00:16:34.428]  Suddenly, they're saying they own our voice.
[00:16:34.428 --> 00:16:36.789]  I say, hey, you don't own my voice.
[00:16:36.789 --> 00:16:39.530]  I never signed my voice away.
[00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:43.272]  You can only do a performance if I'd signed a contract, which I haven't.
[00:16:44.568 --> 00:16:45.870]  They said it was a spoken word.
[00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:49.715]  They could copyright and put a computer block on that speech.
[00:16:49.715 --> 00:16:53.680]  But now they're saying, no, no, no, Alex, your voice is being brought down.
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:57.324]  Do you understand how big this is?
[00:16:57.324 --> 00:17:00.909]  So I'm forced to start the wheels in motion.
[00:17:03.649 --> 00:17:05.110]  And people can look at the court records.
[00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:08.051]  I've had to sue people five times before.
[00:17:08.051 --> 00:17:12.534]  I don't want to have to go perfect a suit, make sure I'm going to win or be close to winning.
[00:17:12.534 --> 00:17:12.974]  Go do it.
[00:17:12.974 --> 00:17:19.437]  You think Jesse Ventura was happy to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars suing the feds for the TSA?
[00:17:19.437 --> 00:17:22.499]  You've got to do it.
[00:17:22.499 --> 00:17:26.381]  Because they're setting a precedent where they say you're deceptive.
[00:17:26.381 --> 00:17:28.422]  They don't say what it is that's deceptive.
[00:17:28.422 --> 00:17:30.964]  You get one line to respond.
[00:17:30.964 --> 00:17:31.304]  We said,
[00:17:32.878 --> 00:17:36.701]  We are not being deceptive in the video you removed.
[00:17:36.701 --> 00:17:39.863]  It was a false copyright claim against us.
[00:17:39.863 --> 00:17:42.025]  We made a video about it.
[00:17:42.025 --> 00:17:45.888]  You removed the copyright claim but banned our video and gave us a strike.
[00:17:45.888 --> 00:17:46.789]  We are contesting this.
[00:17:47.878 --> 00:17:51.119]  And they responded back within minutes, meaning no one actually read it.
[00:17:51.119 --> 00:17:52.279]  It was automated now.
[00:17:52.279 --> 00:17:54.800]  Saying, well, I actually have the letter right here.
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.260]  Here it is.
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.541]  All going in the legal file.
[00:17:58.541 --> 00:18:00.701]  But the real court is public opinion.
[00:18:00.701 --> 00:18:02.042]  We're going to put Google on trial.
[00:18:02.042 --> 00:18:05.262]  I've already been doing it, but we've got to really show all the crimes they're committing.
[00:18:05.262 --> 00:18:14.785]  Not just acting like they're a free speech outfit with false advertising and then doing this and slandering me, calling me a deceptive liar.
[00:18:16.732 --> 00:18:18.374]  That's what the notice said.
[00:18:18.374 --> 00:18:20.637]  Your video is deceptive.
[00:18:20.637 --> 00:18:21.699]  And a fraud.
[00:18:21.699 --> 00:18:23.602]  And a scam.
[00:18:23.602 --> 00:18:24.723]  Really?
[00:18:24.723 --> 00:18:24.963]  Really?
[00:18:24.963 --> 00:18:26.345]  I'm a fraud and I'm a scam?
[00:18:26.345 --> 00:18:29.890]  Is that why you took the copyright claim off?
[00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:31.953]  That's gonna look real good in court.
[00:18:31.953 --> 00:18:33.776]  It's gonna look even better in the newspapers, Google.
[00:18:35.677 --> 00:18:42.823]  Well, I flail around talking about everything, which I'm already doing, but I'm going to make it my business, my business to come after you.
[00:18:42.823 --> 00:18:43.883]  And go ahead and delist us.
[00:18:43.883 --> 00:18:50.108]  You've already listed InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com off the Google News.
[00:18:50.108 --> 00:18:53.431]  You've already sat there and tried to delist us on the web.
[00:18:53.431 --> 00:18:55.012]  We have the listeners.
[00:18:55.012 --> 00:19:00.016]  No matter what you try to get the word out about InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, no matter what you try,
[00:19:01.923 --> 00:19:08.969]  And there's other people out there that support free speech like DrugsReport.com and WorldNetDaily.com and countless others.
[00:19:08.969 --> 00:19:12.792]  So you're not gonna shut us all down.
[00:19:12.792 --> 00:19:17.657]  I'm not happy about these attacks, but if that's the way it is, that's the way it is.
[00:19:17.657 --> 00:19:20.939]  Thank you for submitting your video appeal to YouTube.
[00:19:20.939 --> 00:19:26.724]  After further review of the content in minutes, we've determined that your video does violate our community guidelines.
[00:19:26.724 --> 00:19:27.885]  So it's like a communist system.
[00:19:27.885 --> 00:19:28.966]  Oh, the community says so?
[00:19:28.966 --> 00:19:29.367]  We agree.
[00:19:32.254 --> 00:19:33.675]  And have upheld our original decision.
[00:19:33.675 --> 00:19:35.016]  We appreciate our understanding.
[00:19:35.016 --> 00:19:38.557]  Sincerely, the YouTube team.
[00:19:38.557 --> 00:19:39.878]  The YouTube team.
[00:19:39.878 --> 00:19:45.220]  And of course, I'll also be able, in those subpoenas, to get who's lodging these complaints.
[00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:49.362]  All right, we get back.
[00:19:49.362 --> 00:19:54.344]  You want to know, I've been telling you for 15 years, you're going to face scan to buy and sell, because MIT said so.
[00:19:54.344 --> 00:19:55.524]  It's a Fallujah model.
[00:19:55.524 --> 00:19:57.325]  They actually tested this in Fallujah.
[00:19:57.325 --> 00:19:58.926]  We're going to break it down straight ahead.
[00:20:01.966 --> 00:20:08.151]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid, and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[00:20:08.151 --> 00:20:13.255]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[00:20:13.255 --> 00:20:15.437]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[00:20:15.437 --> 00:20:22.743]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[00:20:23.223 --> 00:20:26.926]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[00:20:26.926 --> 00:20:31.170]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:37.855]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling Power Hub unit.
[00:20:37.855 --> 00:20:40.837]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[00:20:40.837 --> 00:20:43.860]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:47.483]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar-powered.
[00:20:47.483 --> 00:20:49.905]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[00:20:50.425 --> 00:20:55.414]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[00:20:55.414 --> 00:20:56.996]  That's BeatTheBlackouts.com.

[00:21:23.857 --> 00:21:27.261]  You could buy three Survival Seed Vaults for less than one of theirs.
[00:21:27.261 --> 00:21:33.908]  The Survival Seed Vault from MyPatriotSupply.com includes detailed planting and seed saving instructions and ships same day.

[00:23:18.263 --> 00:23:20.425]  BigBerkyWaterFilters.com.
[00:23:20.425 --> 00:23:21.106]  Wise Foods.
[00:23:21.306 --> 00:23:26.628]  Ready-to-eat meals are packed in airtight nitrogen pouches and come with a 25-year shelf life.
[00:23:26.628 --> 00:23:32.930]  Big Berkey water filters are powerful enough to purify treated, untreated, or even stagnant pond water.

[00:24:17.981 --> 00:24:23.923]  So, how do you get people to opt-in to face scanning to buy and sell?
[00:24:23.923 --> 00:24:25.543]  What's your electronic checkpoints?
[00:24:25.543 --> 00:24:28.505]  How do you get people to opt-in to giving up cash?
[00:24:28.505 --> 00:24:31.846]  How do you get people to accept it so they can then force everybody to do it?
[00:24:32.734 --> 00:24:39.078]  Like Louisiana's doing last year, banning cash in second-hand transactions.
[00:24:39.078 --> 00:24:47.884]  Statewide, anything that's being resold, a car, a coffee maker at a garage sale, anything, you go to jail for that.
[00:24:47.884 --> 00:24:51.147]  People are also now going to jail for lemonade stands and chalk on the street.
[00:24:52.441 --> 00:24:55.702]  And nationwide they are announcing they want permits for gardens.
[00:24:55.702 --> 00:24:58.303]  Prisoners are not allowed to grow their own food.
[00:24:58.303 --> 00:24:59.604]  And we'll put up with it.
[00:24:59.604 --> 00:25:05.646]  We love... America is now about groveling to false corrupt authority.
[00:25:05.646 --> 00:25:11.248]  Many people enjoy turning their children over to pedophiles to be groped by them at the airport.
[00:25:11.248 --> 00:25:14.770]  People kind of like the fact that the head of Penn State
[00:25:15.971 --> 00:25:19.694]  Who helped cover up the rape of children has now been given a homeless security job.
[00:25:19.694 --> 00:25:21.335]  That's what they respect.
[00:25:21.335 --> 00:25:24.017]  Not our listeners, but a lot of people, they do.
[00:25:24.017 --> 00:25:27.940]  I mean, they love the sycophantic worship of tyranny.
[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:31.063]  Because they love being passive-aggressive with themselves.
[00:25:31.063 --> 00:25:32.664]  And kind of getting into their own destruction.
[00:25:32.664 --> 00:25:34.966]  Well, you're going to get the destruction you want.
[00:25:34.966 --> 00:25:35.966]  Don't worry.
[00:25:35.966 --> 00:25:39.489]  The bankers are going to hurt you real bad.
[00:25:39.489 --> 00:25:43.192]  Take the shots, drink all the fluoride, and put your kids on Prozac.
[00:25:43.823 --> 00:25:45.304]  and enjoy all that comes out of it.
[00:26:04.298 --> 00:26:06.539]  And Facebook admits their merge with Homeland Security.
[00:26:06.539 --> 00:26:12.643]  It's watching you and watching you off your face profiles and it face scans you.
[00:26:12.643 --> 00:26:16.605]  And the little message pops up that you're going to get a free shot of whiskey.
[00:26:16.605 --> 00:26:21.188]  Oh, it's so the head of Facebook likes me.
[00:26:21.188 --> 00:26:22.169]  He's nice.
[00:26:22.169 --> 00:26:28.012]  See, that's why the stock dropped by more than 50 percent since it opened and was a known pump and dump.
[00:26:28.012 --> 00:26:30.473]  That's why he dumped his stock up front, too.
[00:26:30.473 --> 00:26:31.094]  But they sent
[00:26:33.046 --> 00:26:36.631]  They sent Martha Stewart to prison for no reason because she's low-level.
[00:26:36.631 --> 00:26:40.516]  She's not an insider, but they want to make you think they're going after corruption on the stock market.
[00:26:41.513 --> 00:26:47.058]  So let's go ahead and go to a short video clip of this and analyze this disgusting propaganda.
[00:26:47.058 --> 00:26:47.919]  Here it is.
[00:26:47.919 --> 00:26:51.962]  We asked ourselves, why haven't Facebook check-ins gone mainstream?
[00:26:51.962 --> 00:26:57.227]  Check-ins provide a powerful mechanism for businesses to deliver discounts to loyal customers.
[00:26:57.227 --> 00:27:01.470]  A few businesses, and even fewer customers, are taking advantage of this.
[00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:08.797]  Businesses set out to evolve the check-in process by creating a seamless method for checking and completing deals.
[00:27:09.827 --> 00:27:11.067]  What's up with that?
[00:27:11.067 --> 00:27:11.427]  Oh my god.
[00:27:11.427 --> 00:27:11.847]  Customize.
[00:27:11.847 --> 00:27:11.907]  Oh.
[00:27:11.907 --> 00:27:12.068]  Oh.
[00:27:12.068 --> 00:27:12.168]  Oh.
[00:27:12.168 --> 00:27:12.208]  Oh.
[00:27:38.089 --> 00:27:39.270]  Oh, profile created!
[00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:41.391]  Oh my gosh, he's got... Gonna get a deal!
[00:27:41.391 --> 00:27:42.112]  Oh, your life history!
[00:27:42.112 --> 00:27:46.255]  When you buy something!
[00:27:57.874 --> 00:27:59.956]  Oh, it's that's just so simple.
[00:27:59.956 --> 00:28:03.920]  The AI computer is currently beta testing with select Nashville business.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.462]  Isn't that nice?
[00:28:05.462 --> 00:28:09.206]  And the whole thing is profiled with the cold blooded black ops commanders that run Facebook.
[00:28:09.206 --> 00:28:12.169]  It is an NSA front on record, just like Google.
[00:28:12.169 --> 00:28:12.469]  All right.
[00:28:12.469 --> 00:28:13.190]  Who are we targeting?
[00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:16.213]  The demographic to roll this out at is nerds who think they're trendy.
[00:28:17.287 --> 00:28:19.089]  Alright, bring in our psych warfare experts.
[00:28:19.089 --> 00:28:32.864]  Well, our scans and click research shows that if we go with a boppish, sycophant, demoralized voice of a person that's so trendy they can't even finish their words and have had their
[00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:37.843]  Semantical lexicon reduced in size.
[00:28:37.843 --> 00:28:45.811]  I mean, they are targeting, and it shows these jellyfish, well-meaning women, are going into the bar of the bartender, Nicey!
[00:28:45.811 --> 00:28:51.117]  We run your entire life history, so you get drink and then customize deal!
[00:28:53.584 --> 00:28:55.445]  Oh, it's so much fun!
[00:28:55.445 --> 00:28:56.706]  Oh, their little friend!
[00:29:23.684 --> 00:29:31.247]  It'll come to the point when you walk into a store and the face scan says you've been picked up, they're gonna send police to that location.
[00:29:31.247 --> 00:29:34.428]  And then when you try to run, they're gonna have a drone blow your car up.
[00:29:34.428 --> 00:29:38.170]  I told you that over a decade ago, and now they admit that's the plan.
[00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:41.951]  This whole thing is a giant prison.
[00:29:41.951 --> 00:29:43.252]  Now why are we on Facebook?
[00:29:43.252 --> 00:29:49.775]  We're using the enemy transmission system to fight back against them.
[00:29:49.775 --> 00:29:51.175]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.175 --> 00:29:52.676]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.681 --> 00:29:56.371]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.501 --> 00:30:10.606]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.
[00:30:10.606 --> 00:30:14.688]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.
[00:30:14.688 --> 00:30:21.992]  These all-natural soaps are made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils that are earth-friendly and safe.
[00:30:21.992 --> 00:30:24.814]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[00:30:24.994 --> 00:30:29.838]  Or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[00:30:29.838 --> 00:30:35.782]  Buy the 1 to 2 month sample package and enjoy soaps that are twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:30:35.782 --> 00:30:41.207]  Or save big with a 1 to 2 year supply of soaps for all your cleaning needs.
[00:30:41.207 --> 00:30:43.188]  This is an amazing deal.
[00:30:43.188 --> 00:30:48.412]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.
[00:30:48.412 --> 00:30:51.555]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com or call
[00:30:51.795 --> 00:30:53.019]  Call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[00:31:01.351 --> 00:31:07.355]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid, and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[00:31:07.355 --> 00:31:12.938]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[00:31:12.938 --> 00:31:15.179]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[00:31:15.179 --> 00:31:22.664]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[00:31:23.164 --> 00:31:26.989]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[00:31:26.989 --> 00:31:31.333]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[00:31:31.333 --> 00:31:37.721]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling Power Hub unit.
[00:31:38.181 --> 00:31:41.224]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[00:31:41.224 --> 00:31:44.346]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[00:31:44.346 --> 00:31:48.069]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar-powered.
[00:31:48.069 --> 00:31:51.091]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[00:31:51.091 --> 00:31:56.215]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[00:31:56.215 --> 00:31:57.856]  That's BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[00:32:00.117 --> 00:32:06.259]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[00:32:06.259 --> 00:32:09.220]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:14.601]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[00:32:14.601 --> 00:32:19.583]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[00:32:19.583 --> 00:32:26.885]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods or meat foods direct now.
[00:32:27.205 --> 00:32:31.087]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[00:32:31.087 --> 00:32:32.867]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[00:32:32.867 --> 00:32:36.889]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[00:32:36.889 --> 00:32:39.810]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:42.571]  The fact is, you can eat at any time to save money today.
[00:32:42.571 --> 00:32:47.133]  And because it stores for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[00:32:47.133 --> 00:32:47.793]  Don't wait!
[00:32:47.793 --> 00:32:49.674]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:32:49.674 --> 00:32:49.834]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:32:55.256 --> 00:32:55.957]  Now listen up!
[00:32:55.957 --> 00:32:56.998]  This is a razor sharp!
[00:33:24.411 --> 00:33:24.613]  Oh!
[00:33:30.606 --> 00:33:37.149]  Oh my gosh, my life history for the Pentagon.
[00:33:37.149 --> 00:33:41.171]  I'm going to get a discount.
[00:33:41.171 --> 00:33:46.753]  My life history hooked into a database to get discounts.
[00:33:46.753 --> 00:33:49.675]  And it tells me what discounts I can get.
[00:33:49.675 --> 00:33:51.475]  It tells me what to drink and eat.
[00:33:51.475 --> 00:33:52.436]  It's no big deal.
[00:33:57.578 --> 00:34:00.779]  I mean, you know, the Department of Defense scanning my face to buy and sell.
[00:34:00.779 --> 00:34:03.299]  I mean, it's nothing to worry about.
[00:34:03.299 --> 00:34:05.440]  Hello, Mr. Govert.
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.580]  Just plastic explosives.
[00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:12.181]  Nothing to worry about.
[00:34:12.181 --> 00:34:14.702]  It's just a vaccine.
[00:34:14.702 --> 00:34:18.763]  Everybody gets consonant and brain damage.
[00:34:18.763 --> 00:34:21.904]  Oh my gosh, I'm signaling to you that I can hardly talk.
[00:34:21.904 --> 00:34:23.244]  Oh, it knows who you are.
[00:34:23.244 --> 00:34:24.204]  That's really good.
[00:34:27.981 --> 00:34:30.603]  Oh, everyone knows who I am!
[00:34:30.603 --> 00:34:32.704]  Your life history?
[00:34:32.704 --> 00:34:35.606]  Oh, that is good!
[00:34:35.606 --> 00:34:38.368]  Dumb effers!
[00:34:38.368 --> 00:34:39.289]  Yeah!
[00:34:39.289 --> 00:34:41.350]  Our users think we like them and care about them!
[00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:42.651]  Haha, what a bunch of dumb idiots!
[00:34:42.651 --> 00:34:43.432]  Oh no, keep it going!
[00:34:43.432 --> 00:34:43.712]  Come on!
[00:34:43.712 --> 00:34:44.692]  Don't take the voice away!
[00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:55.541]  Next, verify your likeness to complete your profile.
[00:34:55.541 --> 00:34:57.442]  Oh, my goodness.
[00:34:57.442 --> 00:34:58.682]  Oh.
[00:34:58.682 --> 00:35:00.363]  Profile created!
[00:35:00.363 --> 00:35:03.124]  Confidently recognize the deal is set into action.
[00:35:03.124 --> 00:35:04.184]  Oh, it's not threatening.
[00:35:04.184 --> 00:35:05.385]  You hear my voice.
[00:35:05.385 --> 00:35:06.565]  I'm not threatening.
[00:35:06.565 --> 00:35:09.986]  Never mind the drones.
[00:35:09.986 --> 00:35:14.548]  Look at the nice TSA man with your daughter.
[00:35:14.548 --> 00:35:16.389]  Jerry Sandusky will help.
[00:35:18.365 --> 00:35:20.087]  Oh, it's that simple.
[00:35:20.087 --> 00:35:22.609]  Yeah, I mean, don't use cash.
[00:35:22.609 --> 00:35:24.571]  Don't even use a credit card where they can track you.
[00:35:24.571 --> 00:35:35.601]  Just go right in and have a giant database run where the creator and front guy for all this calls you dumb effers.
[00:35:35.601 --> 00:35:42.748]  And again, all of this tyranny, that's like NPR is like, today on NPR, we'll discuss
[00:35:45.758 --> 00:35:51.304]  Uh, we asked ourselves... Just let me put this rope around your neck.
[00:35:51.304 --> 00:35:52.285]  I'm afraid, Dave.
[00:35:52.285 --> 00:35:53.066]  I'm afraid.
[00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.830]  Dave.
[00:35:58.830 --> 00:35:59.451]  Dave, I'm afraid.
[00:35:59.451 --> 00:35:59.951]  I'm afraid, Dave.
[00:35:59.951 --> 00:36:01.412]  Captain, let's talk about this calmly.
[00:36:01.412 --> 00:36:01.892]  No, don't do that.
[00:36:01.892 --> 00:36:02.533]  Don't do that.
[00:36:02.533 --> 00:36:04.334]  I'm afraid, Dave.
[00:36:04.334 --> 00:36:04.975]  I'm afraid.
[00:36:04.975 --> 00:36:05.915]  I am a HAL 9000 computer.
[00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:31.433]  Created in Chicago, Illinois.
[00:36:31.433 --> 00:36:39.578]  This is a song my first instructor, Mr. Johnson, taught me.
[00:36:39.578 --> 00:36:41.559]  Daisy.
[00:36:41.559 --> 00:36:42.540]  Daisy.
[00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:43.180]  Next stop, Jupiter.
[00:36:53.851 --> 00:36:59.775]  You're not going to win New World Order with all your little Terminator grids and your Skynet crud.
[00:36:59.775 --> 00:37:02.616]  We're going to expose this for how sickening it is.
[00:37:02.616 --> 00:37:08.080]  Everything I've warned people of as it comes to pass, they're only going to wake up now.
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:11.322]  This is designed to track the entire economy and outlaw.
[00:37:11.322 --> 00:37:15.084]  You know why they're going after Amish and lemonade stands and backyard gardens?
[00:37:15.084 --> 00:37:17.786]  Because when they get this in place, folks, it's going to be illegal.
[00:37:19.224 --> 00:37:21.705]  And they're going to shut everybody off with automated systems.
[00:37:21.705 --> 00:37:24.427]  They're not going to let private websites operate in the future.
[00:37:24.427 --> 00:37:28.929]  You're going to have a handful of big mega sites who can shut you off whenever they want.
[00:37:28.929 --> 00:37:31.670]  And you won't be able to engage in commerce without them.
[00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:40.155]  That's why we are all about dominating the internet here at Infowars.com with truth and liberty and justice and all the things that are under attack and they've tried to make cheesy.
[00:37:42.423 --> 00:37:52.770]  But at the same time, I'm going with Print 2.0, putting out our monthly, then we're going to go to weekly, mailed to you, but also digitally emailed to you, because that'll be easy to get around sensors.
[00:37:52.770 --> 00:38:04.578]  IT experts have basically revealed to us over the years of research, to have the InfoWars magazine, which again will start being daily if they ever completely shut us down.
[00:38:04.578 --> 00:38:07.440]  And if you want to get it, it's going to come out next week.
[00:38:08.413 --> 00:38:11.495]  Middle of next week, hard to believe we're getting close to September.
[00:38:11.495 --> 00:38:13.516]  It'll come out a few days before September.
[00:38:13.516 --> 00:38:23.443]  It'll be sent to everybody that signs up at InfoWars.com forward slash, forward slash newsletter.
[00:38:23.443 --> 00:38:27.805]  And you get news alerts, key videos, all sorts of stuff.
[00:38:27.805 --> 00:38:33.289]  Every day we have an email blast now that goes out and tells you what's coming up on the show today, what was on yesterday.
[00:38:34.861 --> 00:38:40.925]  At InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter or on the right hand side of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com you see the InfoWars Insider.
[00:38:40.925 --> 00:38:43.787]  Just put your email in there and you can always opt out if you don't like it.
[00:38:43.787 --> 00:38:46.689]  There's a little button right there and be part of it.
[00:38:46.689 --> 00:38:47.429]  So there it is.
[00:38:47.429 --> 00:38:54.493]  If you want to get the, and by the way, the new magazine, we're going to sell it in bulk in groups of 100 for $50.
[00:38:54.493 --> 00:38:55.994]  That means 50 cents per 48 page right now.
[00:38:55.994 --> 00:38:56.795]  Big, bold, white,
[00:39:04.068 --> 00:39:07.070]  Newsprint slash magazines like a big tabloid size.
[00:39:07.070 --> 00:39:11.432]  I mean tabloid content you know has that big one big page that opens tabloid style.
[00:39:11.432 --> 00:39:18.136]  And then later I'll tell you right now we plan to have a monthly glossy magazine and then we're going to have a weekly newspaper that hammers out.
[00:39:18.136 --> 00:39:27.141]  People are going to be able to have subscriptions to just get one every week or one every month at first or you can order for $50 at cost.
[00:39:27.141 --> 00:39:29.443]  It comes down to 50 cents a piece which is
[00:39:31.062 --> 00:39:31.943]  I want to keep it at that.
[00:39:31.943 --> 00:39:35.986]  It looks like it's going to be a little bit above that because printing, it's like 30 cents.
[00:39:35.986 --> 00:39:40.529]  And after you put everything into it, but hopefully the advertising will carry us over the edge.
[00:39:40.529 --> 00:39:41.991]  It's up to you.
[00:39:41.991 --> 00:39:43.171]  We build it, will they come?
[00:39:43.171 --> 00:39:44.993]  Obviously so.
[00:39:44.993 --> 00:39:46.734]  They're zigging to shut down print.
[00:39:46.734 --> 00:39:50.817]  Print's really dying because nobody wants to read establishment bilge.
[00:39:50.817 --> 00:39:54.380]  That's why even establishment online media is crumbling in front of everybody.
[00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:59.344]  The only thing that's popular is establishment stuff that uses user content like YouTube.
[00:40:00.137 --> 00:40:01.918]  And now they want to curtail and control that.
[00:40:01.918 --> 00:40:03.719]  They don't let you really share videos anymore.
[00:40:03.719 --> 00:40:08.183]  They're knocking sites down all over the place.
[00:40:08.183 --> 00:40:15.768]  And if I hadn't filed a bunch of times with YouTube, we wouldn't have the big Alex Jones Channel with 230 million views that feeds all the others.
[00:40:15.768 --> 00:40:26.895]  See, what's happening on YouTube, the reason they're starting to censor us, and I'll get into all the other news in your calls, is now they've censored and curtailed and done some algorithms and don't let us share.
[00:40:26.895 --> 00:40:28.817]  Even our subscribers don't get our videos.
[00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:31.391]  Even though other subscription systems do.
[00:40:31.391 --> 00:40:40.895]  So they've put some... What do they call it in Formula 1 race cars?
[00:40:40.895 --> 00:40:45.057]  Paul was a Formula... He was a race car driver so he'll know.
[00:40:45.057 --> 00:40:46.338]  Call Richard Reeves in here.
[00:40:46.338 --> 00:40:47.478]  What's the name of the plate?
[00:40:47.478 --> 00:40:48.999]  The repressor plate?
[00:40:48.999 --> 00:40:53.141]  That they put in the cars so you don't go 800 miles an hour and kill yourself?
[00:40:53.141 --> 00:40:55.542]  So now it's so scientific that basically the cars...
[00:40:57.250 --> 00:40:58.931]  Restrictor plate, there you go.
[00:40:58.931 --> 00:41:01.333]  Yeah, yeah, restrictor plates, there you go.
[00:41:01.333 --> 00:41:03.775]  They're putting restrictor plates on us.
[00:41:03.775 --> 00:41:10.079]  I mean, they can already hit a button and erase all the videos on YouTube with my voice on them claiming that they own my voice.
[00:41:10.079 --> 00:41:11.660]  They're trying to set the precedent.
[00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:17.504]  So I challenge the companies that do this out of the blue.
[00:41:17.504 --> 00:41:22.468]  And now eight separate times I've gotten them to stop trying to shut our channel down claiming they own my voice.
[00:41:23.328 --> 00:41:33.856]  Well, now YouTube came back and said, we own your voice, and we're going to shut you down because of that, and if you try to block us, we're going to shut you down.
[00:41:33.856 --> 00:41:36.098]  So people are like, we'll just leave YouTube.
[00:41:36.098 --> 00:41:38.199]  Folks, our stuff is on every video site out there.
[00:41:38.199 --> 00:41:42.102]  About half the video views in the world are on YouTube that Google took over.
[00:41:42.102 --> 00:41:43.523]  Google buys everything.
[00:41:43.523 --> 00:41:45.024]  Like Microsoft buying Skype.
[00:41:45.024 --> 00:41:47.726]  They buy everything because they want control.
[00:41:47.726 --> 00:41:49.428]  They want a monopoly.
[00:41:49.428 --> 00:41:50.749]  And so that's where the fight is.
[00:41:52.486 --> 00:41:54.226]  That's where we're going to fight them.
[00:41:54.226 --> 00:41:55.487]  We're going to expose them.
[00:41:55.487 --> 00:41:55.867]  It's all.
[00:41:55.867 --> 00:41:56.387]  I mean, sure.
[00:41:56.387 --> 00:41:59.587]  I actually had numbers pulled up on it.
[00:41:59.587 --> 00:42:11.329]  We're getting 8% of our traffic from YouTube on Infowars.com.
[00:42:11.329 --> 00:42:13.410]  That is not a big deal.
[00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:14.970]  In fact, we did the numbers.
[00:42:14.970 --> 00:42:16.370]  I had them do the numbers this morning.
[00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:18.911]  We send more traffic to YouTube than they send to us.
[00:42:18.911 --> 00:42:20.511]  So let's get that straight.
[00:42:21.542 --> 00:42:25.824]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com are gigantic websites.
[00:42:25.824 --> 00:42:32.007]  The biggest alternative media sites out there, other than drugs, it's much bigger than us and is a phenomenon.
[00:42:32.007 --> 00:42:34.448]  We're sending YouTube traffic.
[00:42:34.448 --> 00:42:44.193]  We use YouTube because they've got reliable systems that can be spread out there and that's where the fight is, that's where the young people and others are.
[00:42:44.193 --> 00:42:45.494]  That's where new audiences are.
[00:42:46.843 --> 00:42:49.286]  But we're giving them a lot more than they give us.
[00:42:49.286 --> 00:42:52.251]  And we've asked for a partner channel and been denied.
[00:42:52.251 --> 00:43:00.942]  Now imagine, on the cover of dozens of magazines, newspapers, Nightline, MSNBC, you know, I'm in two major motion pictures.
[00:43:02.537 --> 00:43:02.937]  We're good to go.
[00:43:20.996 --> 00:43:21.936]  On and on and on and on.
[00:43:21.936 --> 00:43:23.897]  Profiles and you name it.
[00:43:23.897 --> 00:43:26.358]  Websites getting over a million visitors a day.
[00:43:26.358 --> 00:43:28.159]  Over 115 radio stations.
[00:43:28.159 --> 00:43:29.140]  Terrestrial.
[00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:29.960]  XM166.
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:34.762]  Top ratings in cities where they put a sign up against Rush Limbaugh.
[00:43:34.762 --> 00:43:37.543]  Beating him time after time.
[00:43:37.543 --> 00:43:42.025]  And YouTube does not want to give us a partner channel.
[00:43:42.025 --> 00:43:45.587]  Fine.
[00:43:45.587 --> 00:43:48.468]  They have wanted to place ads on our vid channels and we've told them no.
[00:43:50.814 --> 00:43:54.277]  The point is, is that they're scared of us.
[00:43:54.277 --> 00:43:55.638]  That's why we're there.
[00:43:55.638 --> 00:43:57.439]  We're going to continue to be there.
[00:43:57.439 --> 00:44:00.462]  So everybody go get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[00:44:00.462 --> 00:44:02.243]  The site works really good.
[00:44:02.243 --> 00:44:04.585]  Some of the streams occasionally have hiccups during peak times.
[00:44:04.585 --> 00:44:06.646]  We're adding more servers to that.
[00:44:06.646 --> 00:44:10.369]  One membership is $5.95 a month and you really get six memberships with that.
[00:44:10.369 --> 00:44:12.371]  Get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership today!
[00:44:15.185 --> 00:44:16.526]  We have archives of the show.
[00:44:16.526 --> 00:44:19.887]  A few hours after it goes out, airs the first time at 7 o'clock.
[00:44:19.887 --> 00:44:21.428]  We're adding more shows.
[00:44:21.428 --> 00:44:27.330]  We're getting the crew to add more specialty shows on health and firearms and self-defense.
[00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:31.172]  I mean, we're trying to really give the globalists a run for their money, okay?
[00:44:31.172 --> 00:44:34.453]  And we're having big success, but we're doing it from the grassroots up.
[00:44:34.453 --> 00:44:35.774]  So, support us!
[00:44:35.774 --> 00:44:38.115]  That's why we have PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:44:38.115 --> 00:44:39.876]  Infowarsnews.com will get you there as well.
[00:44:41.177 --> 00:44:43.161]  $5.95 a month, six memberships.
[00:44:43.161 --> 00:44:45.906]  That's less than a dollar per person.
[00:44:45.906 --> 00:44:48.030]  Create a username and passcode that you can share.
[00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:48.992]  Give it to friends and family.
[00:44:50.546 --> 00:44:52.227]  Say, hey, here's your little e-card.
[00:44:52.227 --> 00:44:53.587]  Here's your username and passcode.
[00:44:53.587 --> 00:44:54.688]  Look at all these films.
[00:44:54.688 --> 00:44:55.368]  Watch all this.
[00:44:55.368 --> 00:45:00.790]  Because, yes, they've taken Obama deception down three times with false claims.
[00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:04.832]  They've hacked it and YouTube restored it after we made a big hullabaloo.
[00:45:04.832 --> 00:45:05.573]  You did.
[00:45:05.573 --> 00:45:08.534]  They've done everything they can, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:08.534 --> 00:45:09.834]  We're reaching around.
[00:45:09.834 --> 00:45:11.195]  Let's be conservative.
[00:45:11.195 --> 00:45:13.116]  I did another analysis last night.
[00:45:13.116 --> 00:45:14.156]  I said 7 to 10 million.
[00:45:14.156 --> 00:45:16.217]  It's more than 10 million now a week.
[00:45:16.217 --> 00:45:17.158]  Because here's what's happening.
[00:45:17.158 --> 00:45:17.858]  I'll get into other news.
[00:45:17.858 --> 00:45:20.039]  I'm kind of ranting about the future of the web, everything.
[00:45:21.854 --> 00:45:23.697]  Here's what's happening.
[00:45:23.697 --> 00:45:34.194]  There are so many channels now carrying my daily radio show slash TV show three hours and so many YouTube channels carrying the nightly news that
[00:45:36.854 --> 00:45:41.536]  There's so many channels that have thousands of views per video, some of them like 50,000, 100,000.
[00:45:41.536 --> 00:45:49.779]  That's how I know there's some type of restrictor plate on us, because most people that are subscribers are, you know, quarter million subscribers.
[00:45:49.779 --> 00:45:53.641]  I don't even promote that channel's subscribers, but the main feed channel, we got a bunch of others.
[00:45:54.977 --> 00:46:01.682]  They're not getting their videos, but other channels that are carrying our stuff are getting the subscribers and everybody's getting them.
[00:46:01.682 --> 00:46:08.827]  So you'll have smaller channels with say 10,000 subscribers getting 50,000 views per video, more than we're getting.
[00:46:08.827 --> 00:46:12.170]  So that we've gone around the restrictor plate.
[00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:18.254]  So what they're doing is they're now going in and setting the precedent to ban my voice.
[00:46:18.254 --> 00:46:20.696]  So I mean, obviously I'm going to have to sue Google.
[00:46:21.958 --> 00:46:23.500]  It's big, it's hard to fight.
[00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:26.742]  I'm putting the feelers out to the expert lawyers right now.
[00:46:26.742 --> 00:46:29.124]  But I mean, this is for everybody.
[00:46:29.124 --> 00:46:31.746]  Listen.
[00:46:31.746 --> 00:46:36.170]  Eight years ago, I sued the city of Austin and Access Television.
[00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:37.331]  And I won.
[00:46:37.331 --> 00:46:38.572]  The director went to prison.
[00:46:38.572 --> 00:46:39.933]  It went all the way up to the top of the city.
[00:46:39.933 --> 00:46:41.134]  They shut it down.
[00:46:41.134 --> 00:46:45.098]  Time Warner was not able to take it over and shut down Access TV.
[00:46:45.098 --> 00:46:47.039]  I even quit doing a show.
[00:46:47.039 --> 00:46:48.921]  But I went and saved Access Television.
[00:46:51.072 --> 00:46:54.975]  Because it's personal, folks, when mafia tries to shut us up.
[00:46:54.975 --> 00:47:05.422]  AXS TV, where it was started in Austin, 35 plus years ago, it started here in Austin, AXS TV is still on three channels on basic cable in Austin because I sued them.
[00:47:05.422 --> 00:47:12.247]  And I went and developed the case, did it all, and that fleshed them out.
[00:47:12.247 --> 00:47:19.873]  That got them in fighting, and I went and recorded them once I started the suit, caught them, and I said, I've got the proof you're stealing money, and then they told on each other.
[00:47:21.192 --> 00:47:27.562]  The point is, is that we're gonna get Google, and we're gonna get Facebook.
[00:47:27.562 --> 00:47:35.574]  The head of Facebook needs to go to prison for knowingly pumping and dumping that stock to a bunch of suckers that he's openly called suckers.
[00:47:37.844 --> 00:47:41.628]  We're going to expose the crooks in Homeland Security and the perverts.
[00:47:41.628 --> 00:47:47.114]  We're going to expose the pedophile ring that goes into Homeland Security out of Penn State.
[00:47:47.114 --> 00:47:48.456]  We're going to just expose you all.
[00:47:48.456 --> 00:47:57.126]  You're a bunch of maggot, knuckle-dragging scumbags who want to feed off us and build your empires off our energy and then throw us into the dirt.
[00:47:57.126 --> 00:47:58.187]  And it ain't happening anymore.
[00:48:00.987 --> 00:48:07.753]  Now, they want to get everybody on a cashless society so they can charge you $5 to use your ATM, like Bank of America.
[00:48:07.753 --> 00:48:09.995]  Or they can track everything you're doing.
[00:48:09.995 --> 00:48:12.978]  So everybody's got to go to cash.
[00:48:12.978 --> 00:48:17.722]  Even though it makes it hard for me with tax write-offs and stuff, I'm stopping using credit cards.
[00:48:17.722 --> 00:48:22.367]  Everybody knows when I take people out to dinner or something around here, I'm paying cash.
[00:48:22.367 --> 00:48:24.689]  Then you just turn the receipt in.
[00:48:24.689 --> 00:48:26.571]  Stop using credit cards as much as you can.
[00:48:28.661 --> 00:48:32.904]  I understand sometimes you've got to use them, but it's time to keep cash, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:32.904 --> 00:48:42.292]  Because imagine, they're coming out with face deals cameras that just mirror the Pentagon system going in nationwide that's already tracking what you buy and sell.
[00:48:42.292 --> 00:48:50.919]  They're just rolling it out, getting everybody used to it, where these idiots are going to opt into this and say, my goodness, they just offered me 30% off on this liquor.
[00:48:50.919 --> 00:48:54.822]  Yeah, because that liquor company is paying kickbacks to Facebook.
[00:48:54.822 --> 00:48:56.103]  That's how these programs work.
[00:49:01.411 --> 00:49:03.873]  Could be used by shops to offer discounts to customers.
[00:49:03.873 --> 00:49:08.135]  System already being trialed in Nashville shops and bars.
[00:49:08.135 --> 00:49:14.159]  Users must sign up to take part in the teach system what they look like.
[00:49:14.159 --> 00:49:18.082]  Yeah, you opt in to let them war game a computer.
[00:49:18.082 --> 00:49:21.344]  I've noticed to keep our Facebook, they demand our driver's license.
[00:49:21.344 --> 00:49:25.567]  They've demanded just, and we've done it, just to stay in the enemy's operation.
[00:49:25.567 --> 00:49:28.269]  But I'm like somebody parachuting in behind enemy lines.
[00:49:28.269 --> 00:49:29.970]  You don't want to be on there, folks.
[00:49:31.095 --> 00:49:33.176]  Okay?
[00:49:33.176 --> 00:49:37.699]  You do not want to be... Everybody has got to get off Facebook.
[00:49:37.699 --> 00:49:41.982]  Because it is a criminal enterprise at every level for the globalists.
[00:49:41.982 --> 00:49:42.942]  Run by the banksters.
[00:49:42.942 --> 00:49:44.723]  We've broken it down.
[00:49:44.723 --> 00:49:46.464]  I mean, it is absolutely horrible.
[00:49:46.464 --> 00:49:48.926]  Yes, we're on there using it to attack them.
[00:49:55.438 --> 00:49:57.659]  Now, they're going to get rid of cash this way.
[00:49:57.659 --> 00:49:59.620]  Are you hearing your preachers talk about this?
[00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:00.561]  No.
[00:50:00.561 --> 00:50:05.623]  The churches are under 501c3, Romans 13, government control.
[00:50:05.623 --> 00:50:06.584]  They're not even churches.
[00:50:06.584 --> 00:50:09.525]  They're government-run charities.
[00:50:09.525 --> 00:50:12.787]  And I don't care if you walk in the Methodist, or if you walk in a Baptist church.
[00:50:12.787 --> 00:50:14.928]  I've been in a bunch of them.
[00:50:14.928 --> 00:50:19.370]  You're going to hear, government is your God, and we're about to be raptured, so do what government says.
[00:50:20.848 --> 00:50:25.831]  And those preachers are reading off a script that their denominational heads were given by the government.
[00:50:25.831 --> 00:50:27.192]  These are not churches.
[00:50:27.192 --> 00:50:33.076]  These are like the churches they allowed to stay in effect in the Soviet Union.
[00:50:33.076 --> 00:50:36.038]  And they're all out there saying, Alex is going to go to hell.
[00:50:36.038 --> 00:50:39.220]  I see him online because he says, speak out against evil.
[00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:40.380]  You hadn't read the Bible.
[00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:42.242]  You're cowardly men and women.
[00:50:42.242 --> 00:50:48.586]  And you're going to squeal and beg when the new world order hurts you real bad.
[00:50:49.867 --> 00:50:55.419]  Okay, there isn't a rapture coming, that's all a New World Order lie, so you lay down and go along with it.
[00:50:55.419 --> 00:50:56.602]  Okay?
[00:50:56.602 --> 00:50:59.288]  When the rapture comes later, after it all happens, you ain't going.
[00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:07.227]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[00:51:07.227 --> 00:51:09.829]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:15.215]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[00:51:15.215 --> 00:51:19.900]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:27.802]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods Direct now.
[00:51:27.802 --> 00:51:31.683]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[00:51:31.683 --> 00:51:33.463]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[00:51:33.463 --> 00:51:37.484]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[00:51:37.484 --> 00:51:40.085]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.

[00:51:43.166 --> 00:51:47.728]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[00:51:47.728 --> 00:51:48.368]  Don't wait!

[00:53:29.995 --> 00:53:31.256]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:53:31.256 --> 00:53:35.819]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:53:35.819 --> 00:53:41.623]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:53:41.623 --> 00:53:45.265]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:54:05.939 --> 00:54:15.225]  I was a highwayman, along the coach roads I did ride, with sword and pistol by my side.
[00:54:15.225 --> 00:54:19.288]  Oh, Alex, don't fear monger, they're not gonna put black boxes in cars that track everywhere we're going.
[00:54:21.553 --> 00:54:25.596]  Black box standards coming for cars.
[00:54:25.596 --> 00:54:31.539]  Under the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, you can track everywhere you go and what you do.
[00:54:31.539 --> 00:54:35.042]  The Hill newspaper.
[00:54:35.042 --> 00:54:40.325]  A brief history of false flag attacks or why government loves state-sponsored terror.
[00:54:40.325 --> 00:54:43.787]  Big article by Kurt Nemo up at Infowars.com.
[00:54:43.787 --> 00:54:45.388]  Paul Watson's top story.
[00:54:45.388 --> 00:54:46.389]  Rome burned.
[00:54:47.796 --> 00:54:48.616]  Will we?
[00:54:48.616 --> 00:54:53.277]  And if that isn't a RedLinked headline, I don't know what is.
[00:54:53.277 --> 00:54:56.718]  You guys asking to make Rome burn, will we be a red headline?
[00:54:56.718 --> 00:54:57.778]  Rome burned.
[00:54:57.778 --> 00:54:58.278]  It's red.
[00:54:58.278 --> 00:55:00.058]  This is important information.
[00:55:00.058 --> 00:55:02.079]  Thank you.
[00:55:02.079 --> 00:55:03.819]  Now, continuing.
[00:55:03.819 --> 00:55:04.879]  Well, shoot.
[00:55:04.879 --> 00:55:06.079]  Adan's right to the wall.
[00:55:06.079 --> 00:55:08.600]  Even though it's a bit soundproof, I bet he can hear me.
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:11.060]  Hey, Adan, bro, do me a favor!
[00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:13.421]  RedLink, Rome burned, will we?
[00:55:13.421 --> 00:55:13.861]  Thanks!
[00:55:15.290 --> 00:55:21.493]  New speaker system we have here.
[00:55:21.493 --> 00:55:23.174]  So we're going to be going over all that.
[00:55:23.174 --> 00:55:30.937]  I mean, the magnitude of face scanners when you go into Biden's shell and then harassing you.
[00:55:30.937 --> 00:55:34.799]  That's why they have discount cards at stores.
[00:55:34.799 --> 00:55:39.061]  Those discount cards are not there to give you a discount.
[00:55:39.061 --> 00:55:42.743]  Those discount cards are there, those loyalty cards, the discount cards are real.
[00:55:44.039 --> 00:55:45.340]  The loyalty cards aren't.
[00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:52.605]  They're there to track you and decide what people absolutely must buy so you can raise prices and manipulate people and sell the data.
[00:55:52.605 --> 00:55:59.430]  Now something like InfoWars RX, that is a coupon card and the stores want it because they're associating in it.
[00:55:59.430 --> 00:56:02.592]  But cards where it's only working at one place, those are different.
[00:56:02.592 --> 00:56:05.494]  See the InfoWars RX card, you can put any name you want in there.
[00:56:06.957 --> 00:56:09.678]  The point is, it's just that card and that number, you get the discount.
[00:56:09.678 --> 00:56:11.678]  It's just accessing specials.
[00:56:11.678 --> 00:56:14.379]  Nothing wrong with coupons and things like that.
[00:56:14.379 --> 00:56:19.121]  It's the stuff that tracks you, ladies and gentlemen, that is the issue.
[00:56:19.121 --> 00:56:22.202]  And I can say Facebook is a criminal enterprise.
[00:56:22.202 --> 00:56:29.044]  The pump and dump, the way they sell stuff, they got caught having robots click their customers' ads.
[00:56:29.044 --> 00:56:31.544]  I mean, we could do that at InfoWars.com and PuzzlePlayer.com.
[00:56:31.544 --> 00:56:32.445]  We'd never do that.
[00:56:32.445 --> 00:56:33.445]  That's criminal fraud.
[00:56:34.414 --> 00:56:36.995]  Plus once you get caught it destroys your credibility.
[00:56:36.995 --> 00:56:44.277]  But with somebody like Facebook, they just continue doing it.
[00:56:44.277 --> 00:56:51.119]  And now they have cameras when you go in restaurants and bars and shops where it recognizes you.
[00:56:51.119 --> 00:56:59.302]  Remember last year and this year they've got billboards now that face scan you in Times Square as part of Facebook getting you ready for it so it recognizes you?
[00:56:59.302 --> 00:57:02.723]  Folks, imagine what authoritarian countries would do with this information.
[00:57:04.059 --> 00:57:08.004]  Now coming up, the story's top-linked, left-hand side of DrudgeReport.com.
[00:57:08.004 --> 00:57:09.226]  It's a big deal.
[00:57:09.226 --> 00:57:14.913]  National Weather Service is also following DHS in huge ammo purchases.
[00:57:14.913 --> 00:57:18.298]  And I'm going to break down, if this isn't martial law, what is?
[00:57:18.298 --> 00:57:20.761]  They don't call it that, but we're going into tyranny.
[00:57:24.321 --> 00:57:26.023]  Chinese companies are pulling out of U.S.
[00:57:26.023 --> 00:57:26.744]  stock markets.
[00:57:26.744 --> 00:57:28.626]  I mean, we're on the verge of global collapse.
[00:57:28.626 --> 00:57:31.248]  I don't know if it's going to happen, but we're already in a slow collapse.
[00:57:31.248 --> 00:57:32.930]  Will it accelerate?
[00:57:32.930 --> 00:57:39.657]  All the established... I mean, Zero Hedge was reporting on the fact that they're not going to give people their money if the banks collapse.
[00:57:39.657 --> 00:57:41.859]  I mean, they covered that on the nightly news last night.
[00:57:41.859 --> 00:57:44.542]  This is a crazy time, is all I'm saying.
[00:57:44.542 --> 00:57:45.863]  And remember to support those.
[00:57:46.644 --> 00:57:49.865]  That have supported Liberty this entire time as things implode.
[00:57:49.865 --> 00:57:52.366]  Please spread the word about the broadcast and all we do.
[00:57:52.366 --> 00:57:53.406]  We're under censorship.
[00:57:53.406 --> 00:57:54.246]  We're under attack.
[00:57:54.246 --> 00:57:56.046]  I won't even get into all the stuff.
[00:57:56.046 --> 00:57:57.867]  Please continue to spread the word about us.

[01:00:05.253 --> 01:00:06.554]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.554 --> 01:00:08.335]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.335 --> 01:00:10.096]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.096 --> 01:00:11.696]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.696 --> 01:00:13.237]  Well, so does he.

[01:00:24.363 --> 01:00:26.124]  Well, we covered
[01:00:27.542 --> 01:00:32.244]  A ton of news in the last hour, and I'll cover a ton more this hour.

[01:00:34.785 --> 01:00:38.927]  Let's do first-time calls today and let those folks get a chance to get involved.
[01:00:38.927 --> 01:00:43.629]  What do you think of every federal agency, including those that haven't been armed in the past?
[01:00:43.629 --> 01:00:48.131]  I guess the National Weather Service is now harassing people in the oceans, trying to surf, you name it.
[01:00:48.131 --> 01:00:49.812]  The stories are just horrible.
[01:00:49.812 --> 01:00:52.493]  They're now buying masses of bullets on top of the 1.4 billion.
[01:00:53.914 --> 01:01:00.079]  Purchased by the Department of Homeland Trader Activity in the last year.
[01:01:00.079 --> 01:01:04.182]  So we're going to be breaking all of this down.
[01:01:04.182 --> 01:01:08.986]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are on fire today with news.
[01:01:08.986 --> 01:01:10.327]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:01:10.327 --> 01:01:10.387]  800-259-9231.
[01:01:10.387 --> 01:01:12.609]  The Rockwell's coming up in T-minus 60 minutes.
[01:01:12.609 --> 01:01:14.270]  FAA documents show drones over U.S.
[01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:15.131]  pose huge safety risk.
[01:01:24.212 --> 01:01:27.694]  Those have now been leaked out by the Center for Investigative Reporting.
[01:01:27.694 --> 01:01:33.038]  Yeah, how they've almost crashed and a bunch of passenger airliners have crashed, caused highway shutdowns.
[01:01:33.038 --> 01:01:36.180]  When I saw this drone out over the highway the other day, everybody was slowing down and pulling off.
[01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:38.041]  I was like, what is that?
[01:01:38.041 --> 01:01:39.762]  I guess that's the whole point of the acclamation.
[01:01:41.723 --> 01:01:45.665]  We'll also get into the Paul Ryan selection.
[01:01:45.665 --> 01:01:48.846]  Again, they could have picked somebody worse than Paul Ryan.
[01:01:48.846 --> 01:01:53.087]  But he did vote for the Banker Bailout, No Child Left Behind, and NDAA.
[01:01:53.087 --> 01:01:54.908]  But yeah, they could have picked somebody worse.
[01:01:54.908 --> 01:01:56.929]  Somebody like Mitt Romney could be the VP.
[01:01:56.929 --> 01:01:57.929]  Oh, but he'll be the President.
[01:01:57.929 --> 01:02:00.950]  I forgot.
[01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:05.092]  Semi-auto bans, government-run health care, carbon taxes, abortion.
[01:02:05.092 --> 01:02:07.273]  I'm supposed to just be happier than a
[01:02:08.598 --> 01:02:09.919]  See, here's my concern.
[01:02:09.919 --> 01:02:14.920]  Obama, if he tried another term, would get impeached over Fast and Furious and a bunch of other issues.
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:21.503]  And you have Tea Party, you know, type conservatives that are better than, obviously, Obama get in there.
[01:02:21.503 --> 01:02:26.885]  But when, you watch, when Romney gets in, everything's going to get blamed on him now, the globalist agenda.
[01:02:26.885 --> 01:02:32.007]  It'll all just keep moving forward, and the Republicans will probably lose the House and the Senate or something.
[01:02:32.007 --> 01:02:36.169]  And then you'll have, you know, Romney will work with the Democrats.
[01:02:36.169 --> 01:02:37.069]  We're going to be in deep trouble.
[01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:40.801]  Just mark my words.
[01:02:40.801 --> 01:02:46.464]  Mitt Romney gets in there, suddenly people aren't going to be concerned about attacks on the Second Amendment, open borders.
[01:02:46.464 --> 01:02:50.025]  It'll be like, oh, but at least he's not Nancy Pelosi.
[01:02:50.025 --> 01:02:50.846]  That's what Democrats do.
[01:02:50.846 --> 01:02:58.709]  It's like, oh, Obama's torturing in secret arrest, and corruption, and banker bailouts as well, and shutting down one-third of our power plants.
[01:02:58.709 --> 01:03:01.291]  But I feel that's all right.
[01:03:01.291 --> 01:03:03.572]  At least he's not George W. Bush.
[01:03:03.572 --> 01:03:05.372]  These guys are puppet front men.
[01:03:05.372 --> 01:03:06.213]  What's your take on that?
[01:03:07.927 --> 01:03:16.410]  We're gonna come back, take a bunch of your phone calls, get into a ton of other news, but... Guys, I had it yesterday.
[01:03:16.410 --> 01:03:20.131]  I never got to it myself on air, but Drew covered it last night.
[01:03:20.131 --> 01:03:24.273]  Before I forget, and by the way, the crew's just awesome, will you go and ask...
[01:03:25.816 --> 01:03:33.102]  Do to give me those stories yesterday about the banks not having reserves and top experts saying get your money out of the banks.
[01:03:33.102 --> 01:03:34.003]  I read that article.
[01:03:34.003 --> 01:03:35.324]  I read a lot of these articles.
[01:03:35.324 --> 01:03:36.745]  I never get to them on air.
[01:03:36.745 --> 01:03:41.049]  So I just, that's pretty darn important.
[01:03:41.049 --> 01:03:45.733]  And again, you can see it, the nightly news report at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:03:45.733 --> 01:03:51.457]  We put it out for free the next day for everybody on YouTube, but I don't know how long as they try to ban our channel.
[01:03:51.457 --> 01:03:52.819]  I mean, I can only fight them so long.
[01:03:55.137 --> 01:03:56.818]  Just be up to you.
[01:03:56.818 --> 01:04:01.042]  But again, if they censor my channels, they're going to get all the other channels carrying it.
[01:04:01.042 --> 01:04:05.986]  And that was the good news I was covering last hour, even though there's certain censors trying to shut us down.
[01:04:05.986 --> 01:04:15.774]  Everybody else is posting it now, and the show is so hot in the free market of YouTube, even with the restrictor plates they're putting in, that we're just totally dominating.
[01:04:15.774 --> 01:04:23.921]  I did, this morning, about 30 minutes with a calculator, just counting yesterday's videos and the channels carrying them.
[01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:37.307]  And just adding up 15 or so channels that carry our stuff, it was massive compared to our channel.
[01:04:37.307 --> 01:04:40.429]  Which again, is very exciting.
[01:04:40.429 --> 01:04:47.293]  I mean, I say 10 million, it's, I've done the math, it's way more than that.
[01:04:47.293 --> 01:04:49.155]  And I can't even count up all these channels.
[01:04:49.155 --> 01:04:51.256]  That's gotta have the system really worried.
[01:04:51.256 --> 01:04:52.857]  And I'm glad they are, because listen,
[01:04:54.158 --> 01:04:57.904]  You may have to pull the trigger and just ban my voice, huh?
[01:04:57.904 --> 01:04:58.465]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:58.465 --> 01:04:58.825]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.692 --> 01:05:06.193]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[01:05:06.193 --> 01:05:08.614]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[01:05:08.614 --> 01:05:17.696]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[01:05:17.696 --> 01:05:21.157]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[01:05:21.157 --> 01:05:22.837]  There's no priming required.
[01:05:22.837 --> 01:05:25.098]  It's NSF 42 certified.
[01:05:25.098 --> 01:05:26.578]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce
[01:05:26.638 --> 01:05:27.599]  We're good to go.
[01:05:55.757 --> 01:05:59.378]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[01:05:59.378 --> 01:06:01.819]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:06:01.819 --> 01:06:07.401]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:06:07.401 --> 01:06:12.422]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:06:12.422 --> 01:06:18.004]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:06:18.004 --> 01:06:22.686]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:06:23.226 --> 01:06:30.348]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:06:30.348 --> 01:06:31.448]  And here's the best part.
[01:06:31.448 --> 01:06:38.150]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:41.331]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:06:41.331 --> 01:06:44.432]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:06:44.432 --> 01:06:44.652]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:06:44.652 --> 01:06:44.932]  Remember,
[01:06:53.274 --> 01:06:57.204]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:06:57.204 --> 01:06:59.590]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[01:07:00.302 --> 01:07:03.764]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.
[01:07:03.764 --> 01:07:09.708]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[01:07:09.708 --> 01:07:16.313]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[01:07:16.313 --> 01:07:21.997]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[01:07:21.997 --> 01:07:25.639]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[01:07:25.819 --> 01:07:29.621]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[01:07:29.621 --> 01:07:34.223]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.
[01:07:34.223 --> 01:07:36.724]  You'll also find it at infowarshop.com.
[01:07:36.724 --> 01:07:40.586]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[01:07:40.586 --> 01:07:45.009]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21, by Rosa Corey.
[01:07:45.009 --> 01:07:47.650]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[01:07:47.970 --> 01:07:54.795]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen, exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[01:07:54.795 --> 01:08:02.160]  These titles and a lot more are all available at InfoWarshop.com.
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:08.805]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.805 --> 01:08:11.787]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:19.229 --> 01:08:24.172]  Welcome, my friends, to another hour of the Alex Jones Show, and that is The Voice You're Hearing.
[01:08:24.172 --> 01:08:25.393]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:08:25.393 --> 01:08:28.054]  We are here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:08:28.054 --> 01:08:28.615]  to 2 p.m.
[01:08:28.615 --> 01:08:29.495]  Central.
[01:08:29.495 --> 01:08:30.756]  That's 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[01:08:30.756 --> 01:08:31.596]  Eastern.
[01:08:31.596 --> 01:08:37.240]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.tv, our nightly news channel with all my documentaries and more.
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:41.783]  We also stream the radio show three hours a day there, not just the nightly news at 7 o'clock Central.
[01:08:42.423 --> 01:08:47.704]  There's PrisonPlanet.tv, there's InfoWars.com, and the news site PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:47.704 --> 01:08:55.667]  We have auxiliary sites like InfoWars.net, WhatIsTheEndgame.com, and sites like that.
[01:08:55.667 --> 01:08:56.147]  Warning!
[01:08:56.147 --> 01:08:57.207]  Get your money out!
[01:08:57.207 --> 01:09:03.049]  All legal bank deposits protections are now officially gone.
[01:09:03.049 --> 01:09:10.431]  And this comes by one of the top money managers out there in the world,
[01:09:11.414 --> 01:09:15.456]  We're going to be telling you about that at the bottom of the hour.
[01:09:15.456 --> 01:09:24.520]  Former money manager Anne Branhart, who in November of 2011 made the decision to cease operations of her brokerage firm and return funds.
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:25.901]  A bunch of other people did that too.
[01:09:25.901 --> 01:09:27.662]  They had a Tyco and others.
[01:09:27.662 --> 01:09:33.185]  To her customers citing systematic problems with the entire financial industry.
[01:09:34.369 --> 01:09:39.611]  Has issued a new warning about the sustainability and stability of U.S.
[01:09:39.611 --> 01:09:43.752]  banks and the safety of individual deposit accounts.
[01:09:43.752 --> 01:09:50.214]  You remember three or four years ago, a whole bunch, well accelerating last year, a whole bunch of big money managers worldwide said, I'm done.
[01:09:50.214 --> 01:09:54.155]  I'm out, including George Soros.
[01:09:54.155 --> 01:09:55.115]  Guys, it's over.
[01:09:55.115 --> 01:09:57.176]  I know that many of you are still
[01:09:58.342 --> 01:09:59.984]  Cowering and normalcy bias.
[01:09:59.984 --> 01:10:01.445]  Unable to deal with the reality.
[01:10:01.445 --> 01:10:04.568]  Unable to face the world as it is.
[01:10:04.568 --> 01:10:06.630]  But you have got to snap out of it.
[01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:08.031]  The marketplace is destroyed.
[01:10:08.031 --> 01:10:09.913]  You cannot be in these markets.
[01:10:09.913 --> 01:10:12.015]  All legal protections are now officially gone.
[01:10:13.373 --> 01:10:16.037]  And the article goes over the court rulings.
[01:10:16.037 --> 01:10:20.743]  So we're going to be breaking that down and tying it in with are the U.S.
[01:10:20.743 --> 01:10:24.268]  government and big banks quietly preparing for an imminent financial collapse?
[01:10:24.268 --> 01:10:26.952]  Now, again, we're already in a controlled collapse.
[01:10:26.952 --> 01:10:30.056]  We're already in a recession leading into depression.
[01:10:30.737 --> 01:10:32.417]  They've been giving us cook numbers.
[01:10:32.417 --> 01:10:34.758]  Government is gearing up with checkpoints everywhere.
[01:10:34.758 --> 01:10:37.899]  1.4 billion rounds of ammo total.
[01:10:37.899 --> 01:10:41.019]  And National Weather Service buying ammo.
[01:10:41.019 --> 01:10:43.060]  That's top story at DrudgeReport.com.
[01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:45.200]  Our report from Infowars.com.
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:47.201]  And drones launching everywhere.
[01:10:47.201 --> 01:10:48.961]  And military buildups.
[01:10:48.961 --> 01:10:52.282]  And face scanning cameras going up to buy and sell everywhere.
[01:10:52.282 --> 01:10:54.163]  I mean, this is all happening.
[01:10:54.163 --> 01:10:56.163]  Black boxes going in the cars.
[01:10:56.163 --> 01:11:00.124]  The globalists engineered a fraud to consolidate control and bring us into it.
[01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:05.482]  And that's why we've got two key articles at InfoWars.com today.
[01:11:05.482 --> 01:11:13.267]  And InfoWars, we've gotten to where we can handle a million and a half, two million people hitting the site on peak days.
[01:11:13.267 --> 01:11:16.469]  But today is particularly big, so the site is a bit slow.
[01:11:18.277 --> 01:11:20.018]  We're just getting bombarded with traffic.
[01:11:20.018 --> 01:11:24.761]  We may have to turn the comments off, because that's... The point is, is that InfoWars is up.
[01:11:24.761 --> 01:11:26.863]  If you see it go down, go to Prison Planet.
[01:11:26.863 --> 01:11:27.924]  That's why we got Prison Planet.
[01:11:27.924 --> 01:11:28.944]  It's a backup.
[01:11:28.944 --> 01:11:38.551]  Not really a mirror, because it's got some news that InfoWars doesn't have, but... A brief history of false flag attacks or why government loves state-sponsored terror.
[01:11:38.551 --> 01:11:42.833]  Big article by Kurt Nemo ahead of the season when they could stage terror attacks.
[01:11:42.833 --> 01:11:44.755]  I'm just telling you we're in the prime zone.
[01:11:44.755 --> 01:11:45.936]  Rome burned, will we?
[01:11:45.936 --> 01:11:47.737]  An Alex Jones, Paul Watson article.
[01:11:48.377 --> 01:11:52.478]  That's just some of the reports that are up on the site.
[01:11:52.478 --> 01:11:56.479]  Is DHS preparing for civil unrest with massive ammo order?
[01:11:56.479 --> 01:11:57.300]  They admit they are!
[01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:13.331]  I mean, they've got local police departments nationwide training with the military for it.
[01:12:13.331 --> 01:12:16.672]  I mean, this isn't just some plan like Rex 84.
[01:12:16.672 --> 01:12:19.173]  They're putting hundreds of billions into this.
[01:12:19.173 --> 01:12:23.455]  This is, government is digging in like World War III is about to start.
[01:12:23.455 --> 01:12:26.336]  And Mike, they're menacing the Russians, the Chinese.
[01:12:26.336 --> 01:12:28.617]  And again, I'm not saying the Russians and Chinese are good.
[01:12:28.617 --> 01:12:30.337]  They're big corrupt governments as well.
[01:12:30.337 --> 01:12:34.639]  We're run by crazy bankers.
[01:12:34.639 --> 01:12:39.541]  We'd already been in giant wars if top generals hadn't refused, and admirals over and over again.
[01:12:42.935 --> 01:12:44.716]  All right, I said I'd go to your phone calls.
[01:12:44.716 --> 01:12:46.716]  It is just wall-to-wall craziness.
[01:12:46.716 --> 01:12:50.497]  I'm going to get into all this and a lot more today.
[01:12:50.497 --> 01:12:57.019]  Again, InfoWars is still up, but Kurt Nemo cannot even post new articles right now.
[01:12:57.019 --> 01:12:58.100]  We're locked out of it.
[01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:02.281]  So he's going to post a new article he just did to PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:13:02.281 --> 01:13:03.621]  Again, that's why we have that site.
[01:13:03.621 --> 01:13:07.222]  It's huge, but not as big as InfoWars.
[01:13:07.222 --> 01:13:09.723]  Let's go to your calls here.
[01:13:09.723 --> 01:13:11.324]  Let's go to Eric in Texas.
[01:13:11.324 --> 01:13:12.204]  Eric, you're on the air.
[01:13:12.204 --> 01:13:12.504]  Welcome.
[01:13:13.803 --> 01:13:17.166]  Hey Alex Jones, I'm a first-time caller.
[01:13:17.166 --> 01:13:18.727]  Welcome.
[01:13:18.727 --> 01:13:20.028]  I enjoy your radio show.
[01:13:20.028 --> 01:13:29.114]  You have informed me and wake me up about this global elite and all these people that want to take over and just basically wipe us all out.
[01:13:29.114 --> 01:13:32.097]  One thing I want to discuss with you about is this.
[01:13:32.097 --> 01:13:34.639]  Have you been to the website called thecomingattack.com?
[01:13:38.103 --> 01:14:02.999]  There's an article on there where before the November 2012 election, Obama is going to stage a false flag assassination attempt against himself to incite racial wars so DHS can basically go with him to a report so he can declare martial law, indefinitely shutting down the November 12, 2000 election.
[01:14:05.365 --> 01:14:08.768]  It's all up there on ComingAttack.com.
[01:14:08.768 --> 01:14:09.468]  No, I know.
[01:14:09.468 --> 01:14:11.530]  I mean, yeah, I'm looking at it.
[01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:22.438]  Our whistleblower broke that news months ago that his DHS source was saying that.
[01:14:22.438 --> 01:14:23.159]  And I do remember that.
[01:14:23.159 --> 01:14:25.660]  But listen, here's the deal, and I appreciate your question.
[01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:29.723]  Do you have any other questions?
[01:14:29.723 --> 01:14:32.886]  Yeah, the thing that you were just talking about earlier about Russia and China.
[01:14:33.664 --> 01:14:46.247]  Also, on that same website it shows that it talks about Russia and China basically making a super PAC and basically attacking the United States after Obama declares martial law.
[01:14:46.247 --> 01:14:48.948]  Yeah, no, I appreciate your call.
[01:14:48.948 --> 01:14:53.870]  One source in DHS saying that does not make World War III a giant false flag attack.
[01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:01.524]  You know, I've had Hagman and others on that are breaking that down.
[01:15:01.524 --> 01:15:04.527]  The preparations are all happening.
[01:15:04.527 --> 01:15:07.290]  There's already massive crises happening.
[01:15:07.290 --> 01:15:15.058]  You've got all these White House advisors saying that they want a staged event to be blamed on their political enemies.
[01:15:15.058 --> 01:15:18.161]  But we're always looking for them to call it martial law.
[01:15:18.161 --> 01:15:19.122]  When the TSA
[01:15:20.103 --> 01:15:23.484]  Is sticking their hands down you and your wife and your children's pants.
[01:15:23.484 --> 01:15:24.604]  That's martial law.
[01:15:24.604 --> 01:15:29.165]  When big mega banks can get unlimited trillions from Congress, that's tyranny.
[01:15:29.165 --> 01:15:41.187]  When the President tells Congress that the UN and NATO is in command of the President and not Congress in the area of war, that's martial law.
[01:15:41.187 --> 01:15:43.848]  That's dictatorship.
[01:15:43.848 --> 01:15:48.869]  When the DHS can ship guns into Mexico and get caught and not get in trouble, that's tyranny.
[01:15:49.943 --> 01:15:57.505]  I mean, there are so many countless examples of this that just go on and on and on.
[01:15:57.505 --> 01:16:05.607]  And then, you know, we have sources that end up being confirmed in mainstream British news that they were telling the security guards we will have a terror attack.
[01:16:05.607 --> 01:16:07.508]  Well, they always tell them that, just to expect it.
[01:16:08.308 --> 01:16:11.549]  And we go, OK, you're saying this, but I don't think there'll be an attack.
[01:16:11.549 --> 01:16:12.129]  I said I didn't.
[01:16:12.129 --> 01:16:14.670]  And it's like, Alex, you said there'd be an attack.
[01:16:14.670 --> 01:16:19.111]  And then now we've got all these DHS people saying they're told something big in late October, early November.
[01:16:19.111 --> 01:16:20.831]  That doesn't mean it's going to happen.
[01:16:20.831 --> 01:16:23.172]  But yeah, they're telling police departments this.
[01:16:23.172 --> 01:16:24.112]  It's come out in the news.
[01:16:24.112 --> 01:16:26.852]  They're saying, look for something big in late October, early November.
[01:16:26.852 --> 01:16:30.093]  We've had police call in and break down crying.
[01:16:30.093 --> 01:16:32.534]  Wild tanks are rolling around major cities like St.
[01:16:32.534 --> 01:16:35.455]  Louis, and they're being told this in the briefings.
[01:16:35.455 --> 01:16:37.115]  But it doesn't mean it's going to happen.
[01:16:38.373 --> 01:16:46.004]  Just like the White House got caught under Bush putting out fake terror alerts, they admitted later for political gain.
[01:16:46.004 --> 01:16:50.090]  Just saying there's going to be the attack is a form of staged terror.
[01:16:50.090 --> 01:16:54.716]  So it doesn't mean this is going to happen, because I guarantee you, if we expose this and back it off,
[01:16:55.694 --> 01:17:00.756]  And then there isn't a terror attack because you expose it, I expose it, others expose it.
[01:17:00.756 --> 01:17:05.279]  Then it'll be, oh, you said there'd be a terror attack in late October, early November.
[01:17:05.279 --> 01:17:11.041]  No, I said they're gearing up for civil unrest nationwide and telling the banks get ready for collapse.
[01:17:11.041 --> 01:17:12.562]  And that's all in the news.
[01:17:12.562 --> 01:17:16.084]  And they've got regular army and marines rolling around all over the country.
[01:17:17.082 --> 01:17:27.173]  Running real checkpoints, and they're rolling TSA out on the highways, and they're doing all of this, and they're telling you the NSA is spying on you without warrants.
[01:17:27.173 --> 01:17:28.874]  That's illegal!
[01:17:28.874 --> 01:17:31.737]  But they say they're doing it under an emergency.
[01:17:31.737 --> 01:17:37.623]  They use any crisis they can, real or manufactured, to take our rights.
[01:17:37.623 --> 01:17:39.085]  So that's the answer to your question.
[01:17:41.869 --> 01:17:44.911]  You know, I had the folks on from the Northeast Intelligence Group.
[01:17:44.911 --> 01:17:45.892]  They're interesting.
[01:17:45.892 --> 01:17:47.253]  He's a private detective.
[01:17:47.253 --> 01:17:48.354]  Has a pretty good record.
[01:17:48.354 --> 01:17:50.495]  He has a DHS source told him that.
[01:17:50.495 --> 01:17:57.420]  And then a whole system got built up around that, around his source saying he'd been told that.
[01:17:57.420 --> 01:17:59.341]  Look, I've got the Army manuals.
[01:17:59.341 --> 01:18:03.444]  Everybody always focuses, for whatever reason, on one source.
[01:18:03.444 --> 01:18:08.508]  Instead of DHS manuals, preparing for civil unrest, gun confiscation,
[01:18:10.598 --> 01:18:17.039]  Cordoning of cities, arrest of political dissidents, re-education camps.
[01:18:17.039 --> 01:18:20.680]  The Army is publicly, this stuff is public.
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:28.482]  We write articles with links to army.mil with re-education camps, gun confiscation, and no one wants to talk about it or cover it.
[01:18:28.482 --> 01:18:38.264]  But somebody says, hey, I have a DHS source that said Obama's planting a false flag around the election, and it's Katie bar the door, that's all I ever hear about.
[01:18:39.366 --> 01:18:46.828]  When the real meat and potatoes, 100%, are on your plate.
[01:18:46.828 --> 01:18:48.929]  No debating it.
[01:18:48.929 --> 01:18:50.670]  This is already a tyranny.
[01:18:50.670 --> 01:18:57.372]  It's criminal to train the military to arrest citizens and put us in re-education camps.
[01:18:57.372 --> 01:19:00.593]  It's illegal to train the military for gun confiscation nationwide.
[01:19:00.593 --> 01:19:07.155]  This latest army scenario, where they're going to fight the Tea Party insurrection that's going to link up, they predict.
[01:19:08.732 --> 01:19:10.653]  This is a war game prospectus.
[01:19:30.267 --> 01:19:37.449]  We have the Emergency Centers Establishment Act admitting all the camps, how they're set up, and no one ever wants to touch it.
[01:19:37.449 --> 01:19:40.569]  People just want to say, I think this is a camp, I think that's a camp.
[01:19:40.569 --> 01:19:41.910]  I mean, what do you mean?
[01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:45.471]  They got the NSA listening to everybody illegally like we're a foreign enemy.
[01:19:45.471 --> 01:19:47.631]  They got the borders wide open.
[01:19:47.631 --> 01:19:52.392]  The government's bought 1.4 billion rounds of ammo and still more.
[01:19:52.392 --> 01:19:56.593]  The president's announcing break-ins over radio, TV, and your cell phones.
[01:19:56.593 --> 01:19:58.594]  Censorship's being announced.
[01:19:58.594 --> 01:19:59.574]  We're in trouble here.
[01:20:00.895 --> 01:20:04.357]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.
[01:20:04.357 --> 01:20:10.302]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[01:20:10.302 --> 01:20:16.887]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[01:20:16.887 --> 01:20:22.591]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[01:20:22.591 --> 01:20:26.234]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[01:20:26.394 --> 01:20:30.217]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[01:20:30.217 --> 01:20:34.821]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.
[01:20:34.821 --> 01:20:37.303]  You'll also find it at infowarshop.com.
[01:20:37.303 --> 01:20:41.167]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[01:20:41.167 --> 01:20:45.611]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21 by Rosa Corey.
[01:20:45.611 --> 01:20:48.253]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[01:20:48.553 --> 01:20:55.376]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen, exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[01:20:55.376 --> 01:20:59.618]  These titles and a lot more are all available at InfoWarshot.com.
[01:21:01.092 --> 01:21:03.094]  We've lived in this neighborhood for years.
[01:21:03.094 --> 01:21:06.016]  We have an alarm system and all of our doors have deadbolts.
[01:21:06.016 --> 01:21:10.160]  They kicked in our door and were in and out of our house in about 5 minutes.
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:16.005]  The police arrived in about 20 minutes, but they were long gone with our TV, jewelry, and my guns.
[01:21:16.005 --> 01:21:18.967]  I kept thinking, what if my family had been home?
[01:21:18.967 --> 01:21:25.593]  The police officer said that more than 85% of break-ins are through a door, and that deadbolts alone don't stop intruders.
[01:21:26.033 --> 01:21:32.358]  The officer told me to go to EZArmor.com if we wanted something that would actually stop an intruder.
[01:21:32.358 --> 01:21:38.622]  EZArmor reinforces all of the weak points on your doors and is guaranteed to prevent kick-ins.
[01:21:38.622 --> 01:21:43.986]  I was surprised at how little EZArmor costs and I installed EZArmor in about 30 minutes.
[01:21:44.887 --> 01:21:46.528]  Visit EasyArmor.com.

[01:22:00.290 --> 01:22:03.452]  My name is Frank Bates, and I've got some urgent news for you.
[01:22:03.452 --> 01:22:07.894]  Did you know that a solar storm in 1989 caused an enormous blackout in Quebec?
[01:22:07.894 --> 01:22:09.615]  Here's the really bad news.
[01:22:09.615 --> 01:22:16.158]  Experts are predicting that solar storms will get really severe over the next year, and our electric grid is extremely vulnerable.
[01:22:16.158 --> 01:22:24.842]  In fact, the Wall Street Journal reported that we could soon face blackouts lasting weeks or months, leaving major parts of the USA temporarily uninhabitable.
[01:22:25.342 --> 01:22:27.525]  Are you prepared for this coming crisis?

[01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:04.752]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:23:04.752 --> 01:23:06.853]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:23:07.783 --> 01:23:16.747]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain its world-class healer.
[01:23:16.747 --> 01:23:21.649]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:23:22.285 --> 01:23:33.657]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.

[01:23:41.344 --> 01:23:45.645]  Call 1-866-VENUS-FLY or order from Carnivora.com.
[01:23:45.645 --> 01:23:49.746]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[01:23:49.746 --> 01:23:53.467]  That's 1-866-836-8735.
[01:23:53.467 --> 01:23:56.507]  1-866-VENUS-FLY or visit Carnivora.com.
[01:23:56.507 --> 01:23:57.768]  Protect your immune system.
[01:23:57.768 --> 01:23:58.848]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:23:58.848 --> 01:24:09.150]  Alright, let me go right back to your calls trying to get through a bunch of these ahead of more news and Luroc, well joining us.
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:18.302]  Everybody keeps looking for some big event and that certainly could happen.
[01:24:18.302 --> 01:24:25.984]  The point is government is gearing up with our tax money to oppress us and to start wars with other countries.
[01:24:25.984 --> 01:24:41.149]  Meanwhile, the Washington Free Beacon is reporting silent running Russian attack submarines sailed in Gulf of Mexico undetected for weeks, US officials say.
[01:24:41.149 --> 01:24:41.970]  And it goes over
[01:24:43.106 --> 01:24:43.846]  This report.
[01:24:43.846 --> 01:24:48.408]  Yeah, I mean, the globalists are so busy trying to dominate the United States.
[01:24:48.408 --> 01:24:54.731]  I mean, Obama is shutting down right now one third, roughly, of the U.S.
[01:24:54.731 --> 01:24:57.232]  power plants.
[01:24:57.232 --> 01:25:01.794]  A foreign enemy with B-52 bombers couldn't do that.
[01:25:05.455 --> 01:25:06.996]  They're shipping our jobs overseas.
[01:25:06.996 --> 01:25:09.257]  They're globalists, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:09.257 --> 01:25:13.519]  Once they bankrupt this country, they get to take control of it, posing as the saviors.
[01:25:13.519 --> 01:25:14.299]  It is elementary.
[01:25:14.299 --> 01:25:18.901]  And if you think an asset-stripping globalist like Mitt Romney is going to save you, good!
[01:25:18.901 --> 01:25:25.504]  Now, Obama is so radical, he might stage something and stay in.
[01:25:25.504 --> 01:25:27.965]  That's what happens once a system gets so corrupt.
[01:25:27.965 --> 01:25:32.507]  It allows different parts of the power structure to go for everything.
[01:25:32.507 --> 01:25:33.728]  So anything's possible now.
[01:25:36.778 --> 01:25:45.741]  At a gut level, I'm less scared of Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan.
[01:25:45.741 --> 01:25:51.243]  But my gut also tells me if Obama stays in office, stuff's gonna get so bad, it's gonna bring it to a head.
[01:25:51.243 --> 01:25:55.645]  You know, sometimes you gotta have a bad fever to get well.
[01:25:55.645 --> 01:26:00.247]  Not just get Mitt Romney, who's kind of Obama-lite in there.
[01:26:00.247 --> 01:26:03.748]  And will only make conservatives and libertarians go back to sleep.
[01:26:03.748 --> 01:26:05.809]  Kathleen in Ohio, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:26:10.848 --> 01:26:19.641]  I just wanted to mention about cyberspace and just a personal experience I had about it being shut down incrementally.
[01:26:22.844 --> 01:26:23.525]  That's great.
[01:26:40.299 --> 01:26:42.200]  Sure, it's television and everything over one system.
[01:27:02.688 --> 01:27:03.208]  Thank you.
[01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:36.012]  Uh, in the last, you know, since probably 2008, 2009, although it was probably happening before then, is that the internet is becoming completely dumbed down.
[01:27:36.012 --> 01:27:41.197]  And he said, well, well, if you're a public internet user,
[01:27:42.018 --> 01:27:46.281]  And I thought, and I'd never heard that before, public internet.
[01:27:46.281 --> 01:27:47.802]  And I said, what do you mean by that?
[01:27:47.802 --> 01:28:02.511]  And he said, well, you know, if you're part of a business or a corporation or part of a university, they have very, very highly sensitive and highly organized router systems that will let you delve deep into information.
[01:28:02.511 --> 01:28:09.195]  But for a public person like yourself, you really don't need to know too many things.
[01:28:09.195 --> 01:28:09.776]  And I said, well,
[01:28:10.516 --> 01:28:13.397]  Well, but wait a minute, who's to decide that?
[01:28:13.397 --> 01:28:17.278]  And he said, well, it's on a need-to-know basis.
[01:28:17.278 --> 01:28:30.382]  Yeah, well, that person, under cybersecurity, which they're already phasing in, even mainstream news admits it's the Putin model of censorship, Internet ID, so they can ban you from the web, tax you, trace you, all of that.
[01:28:31.616 --> 01:28:40.401]  They're getting even small level IT people into cyber security programs and give them a little card and the power trip that they get on.
[01:28:40.401 --> 01:28:46.605]  And so I want to tell everybody who, you know, the cops, all of you that have access at the higher level to all this data and get to spying on everybody.
[01:28:47.225 --> 01:28:48.886]  You're dehumanizing yourself.
[01:28:48.886 --> 01:28:53.750]  But yes, they've tried to hire all the dentists my dad knows to spy on their patients.
[01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:57.933]  They're hiring spies everywhere, like we're doing something wrong.
[01:28:57.933 --> 01:28:59.314]  No, no, they're doing something wrong.
[01:28:59.314 --> 01:29:06.700]  They're the criminals in the system, so they want to watch us to try to suppress us from ever getting control of our country back.
[01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:08.881]  But yes, this is the power trip
[01:29:09.842 --> 01:29:13.305]  Of the people that are on the internet too, as they call it.
[01:29:13.305 --> 01:29:19.832]  They're going to start shutting down the old web and only letting establishment types on the quote new internet.
[01:29:19.832 --> 01:29:22.674]  And that's always been their plan and they've stated that.
[01:29:22.674 --> 01:29:25.277]  And I mean...
[01:29:26.599 --> 01:29:38.285]  Most people, preachers, you name it, who they hire to spy on their flocks, just fall down at the feet of someone who comes to their office with a Homeland Security badge, and they're ready to literally, you know, kill their wife if the government told them.
[01:29:38.285 --> 01:29:45.028]  I mean, they just are so cowardly and want that pat on the head by the Gestapo.
[01:29:45.028 --> 01:29:50.030]  We'll be right back with more of your calls and a bunch of news.
[01:29:50.030 --> 01:29:51.411]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.411 --> 01:29:52.912]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.940 --> 01:30:01.623]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.623 --> 01:30:17.089]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:30:17.089 --> 01:30:20.771]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:21.792 --> 01:30:34.543]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:30:34.543 --> 01:30:41.828]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:30:42.509 --> 01:30:52.875]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:30:52.875 --> 01:30:56.798]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:30:56.798 --> 01:30:59.920]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[01:31:00.819 --> 01:31:06.984]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[01:31:06.984 --> 01:31:09.946]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[01:31:09.946 --> 01:31:15.330]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[01:31:15.330 --> 01:31:18.592]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business.
[01:31:18.772 --> 01:31:20.293]  Blowing up your food prices.
[01:31:20.293 --> 01:31:27.939]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoodsDirect now.
[01:31:27.939 --> 01:31:31.802]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[01:31:31.802 --> 01:31:33.604]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[01:31:33.604 --> 01:31:37.607]  I recently increased my supply from eFoodsDirect because we've all known this was coming.
[01:31:37.607 --> 01:31:40.229]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[01:31:40.509 --> 01:31:43.291]  The fact is, you can eat it any time to save money today.
[01:31:43.291 --> 01:31:47.854]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food costs.
[01:31:47.854 --> 01:31:48.514]  Don't wait!
[01:31:48.514 --> 01:31:50.396]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:31:50.396 --> 01:31:51.997]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:31:51.997 --> 01:31:53.498]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[01:32:00.542 --> 01:32:06.043]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[01:32:06.043 --> 01:32:08.443]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[01:32:08.443 --> 01:32:17.545]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure, and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[01:32:17.545 --> 01:32:21.006]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[01:32:21.006 --> 01:32:22.686]  There's no priming required.
[01:32:22.686 --> 01:32:24.946]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[01:32:24.946 --> 01:32:27.447]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[01:32:28.527 --> 01:32:30.048]  Easy to set up and use.
[01:32:30.048 --> 01:32:31.469]  Doesn't require electricity.
[01:32:31.469 --> 01:32:34.631]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[01:32:34.631 --> 01:32:38.014]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[01:32:38.014 --> 01:32:39.935]  Save money by not buying bottled water.
[01:32:39.935 --> 01:32:42.157]  And avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:32:42.157 --> 01:32:44.899]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:32:44.899 --> 01:32:46.480]  It's what my family uses.
[01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:49.782]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[01:32:49.782 --> 01:32:55.046]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[01:32:55.627 --> 01:32:56.853]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[01:33:49.713 --> 01:33:52.976]  So, we mentioned this article, but here it is, and we'll go back to your calls.
[01:33:52.976 --> 01:33:54.237]  Warning!
[01:33:54.237 --> 01:33:55.399]  Get your money out.
[01:33:55.399 --> 01:33:58.682]  All legal bank deposit protections are now officially gone.
[01:34:00.205 --> 01:34:19.297]  And the article goes on, former money manager Anne Barnhart, who in November 2011 made the decision to cease operations of her large brokerage firm and return funds, and George Soros and a bunch of others have done that too, to her customers citing systematic problems with the entire financial industry, has issued a new warning
[01:34:20.237 --> 01:34:21.438]  About the stability of U.S.
[01:34:21.438 --> 01:34:24.960]  banks and the safety of individual deposit accounts.
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:49.134]  The warning, stemming from a recent federal appeals court ruling, surrounded customer funds lost during the 2007 collapse of Chicago futures broker Sentinel, indicating that individuals who lose deposit funds because financial institutions improperly manage the money, even if those funds are supposed to be segregated from other operations of the firm, are essentially left with no recourse in the firm, goes belly up, according to the court.
[01:34:52.850 --> 01:35:00.018]  And it goes on to break down that a misallocation of customer funds is not on its own sufficient to rule a matter of law.
[01:35:00.018 --> 01:35:04.763]  Sentinel acted with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud its customers.
[01:35:04.763 --> 01:35:07.266]  And this is what you've seen with MF Global.
[01:35:07.266 --> 01:35:09.128]  She goes on to say, guys, it's over.
[01:35:09.128 --> 01:35:10.369]  I know that many of you are still
[01:35:11.445 --> 01:35:11.945]  I don't know.
[01:35:42.076 --> 01:35:44.358]  But Franco didn't need to break your thumbs to get your chips.
[01:35:44.358 --> 01:35:49.542]  You're like, I paid for these chips, my money I put in.
[01:35:49.542 --> 01:35:54.506]  If I lose the bet, you get what's out there on the table.
[01:35:54.506 --> 01:35:57.408]  But they take your money, and it's going to be the same thing with the banks.
[01:35:57.408 --> 01:35:59.950]  And again, I'm not trying to destroy confidence.
[01:35:59.950 --> 01:36:01.231]  I've seen the math.
[01:36:01.231 --> 01:36:07.917]  The globalists are gearing up for a police state takeover, they don't deny that, while imploding the world economy.
[01:36:07.917 --> 01:36:10.559]  And while making all these preparations for total control,
[01:36:12.051 --> 01:36:18.635]  And having our government sign on to their derivatives that are impossible to pay back.
[01:36:18.635 --> 01:36:24.198]  You see, instead of just letting the globalists go under, we're letting them hold us hostage, and I don't know what we do about this.
[01:36:24.198 --> 01:36:35.544]  I don't know what we do, but I'm not here waiting for martial law, even though the police and military I talk to say, it's gonna happen, something big, we're getting, they're telling us, get ready.
[01:36:37.418 --> 01:36:42.339]  To protect City Hall and the rich neighborhoods in late October, early November.
[01:36:42.339 --> 01:36:44.940]  I don't know what that is.
[01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:47.080]  Do they think people are going to riot if Obama loses?
[01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:49.421]  I don't think that's the case.
[01:36:49.421 --> 01:36:59.383]  But you know the Justice Department, they got caught down there with the Trayvon Martin thing trying to stir up local groups.
[01:36:59.383 --> 01:37:01.144]  Turned out they were provocateuring it.
[01:37:01.144 --> 01:37:02.564]  They want us fighting with each other.
[01:37:05.069 --> 01:37:06.470]  Could it be race war stuff?
[01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:08.112]  Could it be the new war with Iran?
[01:37:08.112 --> 01:37:09.113]  The stuff in Syria?
[01:37:09.113 --> 01:37:13.537]  I mean, there's a lot of crazy stuff going on right now.
[01:37:13.537 --> 01:37:22.426]  The people that run our country are in a proxy war through NATO and Al Qaeda with the Russians right now in Syria.
[01:37:22.426 --> 01:37:28.772]  My point is, they told the big banks over the weekend, make preparations for the government not to help you during collapse.
[01:37:28.772 --> 01:37:29.993]  You're going to have to fend for yourselves.
[01:37:31.957 --> 01:37:35.959]  He got the government buying 1.4 billion rounds of ammo in the last year.
[01:37:35.959 --> 01:37:49.444]  250 million rounds, 450 million rounds, 750 million rounds, and now more ammo purchases by the, on top of that, by the National Weather Service.
[01:37:49.444 --> 01:38:00.448]  Now theirs is a lot more modest compared to 1.4 billion by the other departments, but this new solicitation is for 16,000 rounds of 40 Smith & Wesson Jacketed Hollow Point.
[01:38:03.246 --> 01:38:05.687]  Illegal to use in war, I should add.
[01:38:05.687 --> 01:38:15.650]  A further 6,000 rounds of Smith & Wesson JHP will be sent to Wall, New Jersey with another 24,000 rounds of the same bullets heading to Weather Station in St.
[01:38:15.650 --> 01:38:17.091]  Petersburg, Florida.
[01:38:17.091 --> 01:38:21.792]  Yeah, the National Weather Service needs 24,000 rounds of ammo at one office.
[01:38:21.792 --> 01:38:25.113]  And it just goes in mentioning all of the departments.
[01:38:25.113 --> 01:38:30.655]  I mean, they are gearing up for out-and-out war with us because they work for the foreign bankers.
[01:38:33.973 --> 01:38:40.335]  Alright, we're going to go to break here in about 8-9 minutes and I'm going to come back and hit your phone calls for two segments.
[01:38:40.335 --> 01:38:43.816]  I haven't gotten to the rest of the economy news.
[01:38:43.816 --> 01:38:48.738]  I got a bunch of election news I want to get into as well.
[01:38:48.738 --> 01:38:52.419]  And amazing news about child porn at the Pentagon, that's in the news.
[01:38:55.026 --> 01:38:59.488]  They're also trying to shut down websites that are critical of vaccine deaths.
[01:38:59.488 --> 01:39:02.350]  I mean, there's just a lot of censorship happening right now.
[01:39:02.350 --> 01:39:05.451]  So we're going to be looking at all of it coming up.
[01:39:05.451 --> 01:39:06.292]  But first off...
[01:39:07.338 --> 01:39:10.520]  I'm going to engage in some crass commercialism here, because we're listener-funded.
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:17.886]  We're not like George Soros and MSNBC that takes banker bailout taxpayer money and then funds anti-gun, anti-family, pro-New World Order stuff.
[01:39:17.886 --> 01:39:19.987]  No, I promote what I use and I believe in.
[01:39:19.987 --> 01:39:23.590]  I find the best gravity-fed filters out there at the lowest price, pro-peer.
[01:39:23.590 --> 01:39:32.156]  I sell them at InfoWarshop.com for 10% off with promo code WATER below what anybody can give them to you.
[01:39:32.156 --> 01:39:36.640]  I research with all, but that was good for the keyboard right there.
[01:39:38.312 --> 01:39:39.573]  Oh man, what a day.
[01:39:39.573 --> 01:39:53.023]  I researched the best seaweed out there, amount of phyla available at InfoWarsShop.com and I start taking that.
[01:39:53.023 --> 01:39:54.904]  Continuing here.
[01:39:54.904 --> 01:39:57.105]  We call this the Rabble Rouser.
[01:39:57.105 --> 01:39:58.727]  CJ came up with a name with it last week.
[01:39:58.727 --> 01:39:59.087]  I was doing it.
[01:39:59.087 --> 01:40:03.050]  People said, well, what do you call a beyond tangy tangerine with
[01:40:06.235 --> 01:40:08.595]  A Polymers Plus.
[01:40:08.595 --> 01:40:09.516]  What do you call that?
[01:40:09.516 --> 01:40:10.996]  A scoop of each.
[01:40:10.996 --> 01:40:11.736]  I'll tell you what I call it.
[01:40:11.736 --> 01:40:13.636]  We call it the Rabble Rouser.
[01:40:13.636 --> 01:40:16.097]  Now you have to get both at Infowarsteam.com.
[01:40:16.097 --> 01:40:18.157]  Your purchase also supports the show.
[01:40:18.157 --> 01:40:23.958]  You can get wholesale prices there at Infowarsteam.com on the products.
[01:40:23.958 --> 01:40:27.519]  And get the Rabble Rouser right there by mixing it yourself.
[01:40:27.519 --> 01:40:29.739]  I'm telling you, I love it.
[01:40:29.739 --> 01:40:31.319]  And it is awesome.
[01:40:31.319 --> 01:40:34.000]  Now here is a little report I put together with Aaron Dykes.
[01:40:35.609 --> 01:40:42.536]  Dealing with the fact that he lost 92 pounds on this, and it's not even sold as weight loss.
[01:40:42.536 --> 01:40:44.898]  Just once you get the vitamins and minerals you need, you lose weight.
[01:40:44.898 --> 01:40:47.280]  I've lost, and I'm still a little bit overweight, but I lost 40 plus pounds.
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:49.582]  I'm losing another 30 or so.
[01:40:49.582 --> 01:40:52.845]  It's all available at Infowarsteam.com, and if you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv,
[01:40:53.846 --> 01:40:54.326]  That's great.
[01:40:54.326 --> 01:41:01.352]  For radio listeners, I'm going to post this video in the next 20 minutes as the top story at Infowars.com so you can see the before and afters of Aaron Dykes.
[01:41:01.352 --> 01:41:02.754]  We finally did it.
[01:41:02.754 --> 01:41:08.098]  After this quick video, we'll go right back to your calls and a bunch of other news.
[01:41:08.098 --> 01:41:12.942]  Obama seeks to rekindle fading Iowa magic on three-day tour.
[01:41:12.942 --> 01:41:16.805]  I'll try to get the water off my keyboard here and we'll be right back.
[01:41:16.805 --> 01:41:17.186]  Stay with us.
[01:41:20.433 --> 01:41:25.375]  Alex Jones here with a message that could revolutionize health in this country.
[01:41:25.375 --> 01:41:30.657]  If we want to defeat the globalists, we have to understand they're using medical tyranny against us.
[01:41:30.657 --> 01:41:35.299]  But to get us into that globalist-controlled system, they want to make us unhealthy.
[01:41:35.299 --> 01:41:44.182]  The globalists spike our water with sodium fluoride, and they admit it causes massive increases in bone cancer, brain damage, and reduced IQs.
[01:41:44.182 --> 01:41:46.703]  The GMO crops have all been directly linked.
[01:41:47.083 --> 01:41:51.308]  To reduce fertility deformities in mammals across the board.
[01:41:52.301 --> 01:41:57.284]  The globalists in these school lunch programs feed children absolute garbage.
[01:41:57.284 --> 01:42:02.028]  Fast food is full of chemical additives, things like silicone.
[01:42:02.028 --> 01:42:15.977]  We are all under attack because when we're operating from a healthy position of good food, natural food, clean water, and the nutrients and trace elements we need, our minds will be on fire.
[01:42:15.977 --> 01:42:20.220]  The powerful, creative human destiny will be unleashed.
[01:42:20.220 --> 01:42:21.701]  I want to tell you a very important story.
[01:42:22.541 --> 01:42:32.215]  Going back about a year and a half ago, I began to learn from friends like Ted Anderson about the incredible health effects of longevity products.
[01:42:32.215 --> 01:42:37.502]  And I started promoting him some because I'd seen his weight loss, his health, all the things that happened for him.
[01:42:38.163 --> 01:42:44.707]  And by the way, things like Beyond Tangy Tangerine and Polymers Plus are not even advertised for weight loss.
[01:42:44.707 --> 01:42:58.034]  It's just that when you take it, you are getting the minerals and vitamins you need from an original plant form, and so you're full because the main crops that are grown on these debilitated, played-out soils
[01:42:58.954 --> 01:43:11.719]  Are not giving you the minerals and vitamins you need so you eat and you eat and you eat and get raw calories that pack on weight and that burn out your different glands and cause things like diabetes.
[01:43:11.719 --> 01:43:16.761]  When you finally start getting the minerals and vitamins and trace elements you need, it is incredible.
[01:43:16.761 --> 01:43:21.323]  Now I've only stuck my toe in the water and lost a little over 40 pounds and I'm still big.
[01:43:22.313 --> 01:43:28.478]  Aaron Dykes, who you know has been working here for six years at InfoWars.com, lost 92 pounds.
[01:43:28.478 --> 01:43:31.841]  We're going to show you some before and afters.
[01:43:31.841 --> 01:43:34.863]  He began to hear the guest on my show a year and a half ago.
[01:43:34.863 --> 01:43:42.649]  He began to do his own research, and he implemented the information that Longevity and InfoWarsTeam.com is promoting.
[01:43:43.510 --> 01:43:45.951]  And had dramatic results.
[01:43:45.951 --> 01:43:57.315]  And that's why I'm telling our listeners and viewers, you need to go to Infowarsteam.com and try just the essential fatty acids, the Beyond Tangy Tangerine, and the Polymers Plus.
[01:43:57.315 --> 01:44:02.257]  And I believe you'll be blown away by the dramatic results that I've had and Aaron's had.
[01:44:02.657 --> 01:44:04.459]  Aaron, break down what happened.
[01:44:04.459 --> 01:44:05.300]  Your story.
[01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:08.243]  I've been overweight in my life for far too long.
[01:44:08.243 --> 01:44:12.648]  Years ago, I lost a lot of weight, more than 50 pounds, but it came right back.
[01:44:12.648 --> 01:44:14.189]  I wasn't able to keep it off.
[01:44:14.189 --> 01:44:20.316]  More recently, I've worked really hard with diet and exercise to try to lose weight, but I just didn't get the results.
[01:44:20.316 --> 01:44:21.597]  It just didn't happen.
[01:44:21.597 --> 01:44:24.380]  I wasn't able to stay motivated long enough to reach my goals.
[01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:31.346]  Then I saw what you were doing with Infowarsteam.com and the great products, Tangy Tangerine, kind of the base one to start with.
[01:44:31.346 --> 01:44:35.189]  I wasn't even trying to lose weight, but I got it because I wanted to feel better energy.
[01:44:35.189 --> 01:44:36.150]  I wanted that nutrition.
[01:44:36.150 --> 01:44:42.035]  Didn't even understand how that could kickstart my own weight loss goals, but the products did that for me.
[01:44:42.035 --> 01:44:47.859]  I found myself suddenly losing weight, more energetic, wanting to exercise, wanting to eat the right foods.
[01:44:47.859 --> 01:44:49.761]  And they don't even advertise it as weight loss!
[01:44:49.881 --> 01:44:50.382]  They don't.
[01:44:50.382 --> 01:44:55.847]  But pharmacist Ben Fuchs explains that's what happens if you're overweight because you're no longer hungry because you're getting what you need.
[01:44:55.847 --> 01:44:59.150]  It was a perfect storm because it was giving my body the nutrients it needs.
[01:44:59.150 --> 01:45:07.579]  It gave my body the things it needs to seek out first, which made me not have to crave after other things that I don't need that don't even provide nutrition.
[01:45:07.799 --> 01:45:11.680]  And what's crazy is this is not advertised as weight loss.
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:14.081]  The company never even promoted it.
[01:45:14.081 --> 01:45:17.001]  We just discovered it's the ultimate weight loss tool.
[01:45:17.001 --> 01:45:23.623]  Not only is it incredible that the Infowarsteam.com products were hidden in plain view, but that there's no teleprompters here.
[01:45:23.623 --> 01:45:28.224]  You know, Aaron, you wanted to endorse these products because everybody on air has seen the amazing transformation.
[01:45:28.224 --> 01:45:31.565]  They've seen me lose quite a bit of weight, but I haven't totally committed to it like you have.
[01:45:32.592 --> 01:45:37.036]  And we're here just telling people the effects that it's had for us.
[01:45:37.036 --> 01:45:39.839]  And by the way, just a week and a half ago, I said, you know what?
[01:45:39.839 --> 01:45:44.123]  I want to lose the next 40 pounds, because doctors have told me I need to lose 80 pounds.
[01:45:44.123 --> 01:45:46.104]  I have a hernia.
[01:45:46.104 --> 01:45:47.946]  It's not a hyenal hernia.
[01:45:47.946 --> 01:45:48.947]  It's in my belly button.
[01:45:48.947 --> 01:45:51.810]  And they told me, they said, you need to lose about 80 pounds.
[01:45:51.810 --> 01:45:52.670]  You'll have to have surgery.
[01:45:53.797 --> 01:45:54.638]  And I've lost 40.
[01:45:54.638 --> 01:45:56.719]  I need to go the rest of the way.
[01:45:56.719 --> 01:45:59.120]  So a week and a half ago, I said, you know what?
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:03.342]  I'm not used to just taking pills all day, taking vitamins all day, drinking drinks all day.
[01:46:03.342 --> 01:46:07.745]  Yeah, I do one tangy tangerine, one polymers today, a couple of essential fatty acids.
[01:46:07.745 --> 01:46:08.545]  Not now.
[01:46:08.545 --> 01:46:10.026]  I'm doing the whole regimen.
[01:46:10.686 --> 01:46:14.247]  And I've lost seven pounds in a week and a half.
[01:46:14.247 --> 01:46:15.688]  I've lost 42.
[01:46:15.688 --> 01:46:17.889]  I quit doing it because I've never been in the habit of doing this.
[01:46:17.889 --> 01:46:21.690]  Gained a few pounds back and now raced seven pounds in a week and a half.
[01:46:21.690 --> 01:46:25.872]  We're going to see what happens here with Alex Jones, folks, because I'm fully committing.
[01:46:25.872 --> 01:46:27.253]  I'm taking it all.
[01:46:27.253 --> 01:46:27.913]  I'm doing it.
[01:46:28.453 --> 01:46:30.675]  Now, breaking this down, it's not just the weight loss.
[01:46:30.675 --> 01:46:32.177]  It's also energy.
[01:46:32.177 --> 01:46:33.318]  It's so many other things.
[01:46:33.318 --> 01:46:34.680]  Aaron, it's like this, Alex.
[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:36.181]  Our world's become centralized.
[01:46:36.181 --> 01:46:44.871]  The people who have taken over the food supply have tried to give us fillers so they can go for, you know, the greatest number of people being fed these junk foods and everything else.
[01:46:45.271 --> 01:46:54.517]  When you take this nutrition, you're giving your body the little codes, the little fats, the little signals it needs, and when the body gets that, it responds to it right away.
[01:46:54.517 --> 01:46:55.978]  That's why it works.
[01:46:55.978 --> 01:47:04.444]  It's really just feeding it in the formula you need, so then you're not seeking out food you don't really need, and it makes things like emotional eating a lot less likely as well.
[01:47:05.064 --> 01:47:09.808]  And I found pizza cravings and things like that went away when I took the essential fats.
[01:47:09.808 --> 01:47:12.891]  When I had the tangy tangerine, you have that base nutrition.
[01:47:12.891 --> 01:47:17.975]  So you're not always looking for nutrition and foods where you're really not going to find it anyway, in many cases.
[01:47:17.975 --> 01:47:21.178]  I think organic foods and stuff like that's really important as well.
[01:47:21.178 --> 01:47:28.504]  But this was a total transformation when I was already eating organic foods, already trying to work out and already trying to change my life.
[01:47:28.504 --> 01:47:30.566]  But this really let it happen.
[01:47:32.467 --> 01:47:34.148]  Actually try this.
[01:47:34.148 --> 01:47:35.029]  They are blown away.
[01:47:35.029 --> 01:47:43.153]  When they find out that when you start taking their proprietary formulation of essential fatty acids, it blows the competition away.
[01:47:43.153 --> 01:47:51.338]  When you start taking Beyond Tangy Tangerine and Polymers Plus and the other key longevity products, it is incredible.
[01:47:51.338 --> 01:47:54.179]  But you've got to continue taking it.
[01:47:54.179 --> 01:47:59.082]  But the body is so starved for nutrition, by design, by the globalist,
[01:47:59.923 --> 01:48:08.930]  I mean, they've engineered this so that we become these self-propelled stomachs always seeking food because we're looking for the vitamins, the minerals, the trace elements.
[01:48:08.930 --> 01:48:11.772]  This has the mighty 90 in it.
[01:48:11.772 --> 01:48:19.277]  The human body needs 90 vitamins, minerals, and trace elements to work in fusion together.
[01:48:19.277 --> 01:48:21.038]  And the system knows this.
[01:48:21.038 --> 01:48:24.841]  So I challenge you, check out the incredible products at mfallwarsteam.com.
[01:48:26.162 --> 01:48:34.466]  Use them, and if you don't see incredible effects, I will be shocked, because everyone I talk to who has used these is sold on them.
[01:48:34.466 --> 01:48:36.507]  You've seen the effects on Alex Jones.
[01:48:36.507 --> 01:48:38.808]  You've seen the effects on Aaron Dykes.
[01:48:38.808 --> 01:48:42.850]  The system knows about high-nutrient diets.
[01:48:42.850 --> 01:48:53.375]  They've done studies where mice and other rodents can live twice as long, or even longer in some cases, when they're given super high-nutrient diets.
[01:48:54.235 --> 01:48:57.697]  But it is not available in most of the foods out there.
[01:48:57.697 --> 01:49:05.041]  We've actually been lied to for decades in our lives, maybe our whole lifetimes for a lot of people, because we're told to eat a certain way.
[01:49:05.041 --> 01:49:08.843]  We're convinced by television and other advertisements of how to live our life.
[01:49:08.843 --> 01:49:10.064]  It's all wrong.
[01:49:10.064 --> 01:49:14.066]  And when you just read about the nutrition, you realize how powerful it is.
[01:49:14.066 --> 01:49:15.667]  You realize this is what we're meant to take.
[01:49:15.667 --> 01:49:19.549]  That's the stuff you find in tangy tangerine and longevity products.
[01:49:19.549 --> 01:49:20.550]  And it was so easy.
[01:49:21.130 --> 01:49:22.371]  That's the most incredible part.
[01:49:22.371 --> 01:49:28.895]  It was so easy to lose weight and regain health for myself, barely without trying, just from taking the products.
[01:49:28.895 --> 01:49:34.059]  We're here promoting what we believe in, what we've seen great results with, to you.
[01:49:34.059 --> 01:49:50.450]  I want to challenge our radio listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and watch this video so you can see for yourselves the incredible results Aaron and others have achieved with Longevity products that are discounted at wholesale prices at Infowarsteam.com.
[01:49:51.470 --> 01:49:58.196]  Again, sign up as a distributor and get wholesale pricing discounts at Infowarsteam.com.
[01:49:58.196 --> 01:50:02.320]  The revolution against tyranny starts individually with our bodies.
[01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:04.562]  There is a global awakening happening.
[01:50:04.562 --> 01:50:11.027]  The sleeping giant that is humanity is awakening, and a big part of that fight starts at Infowarsteam.com.
[01:50:13.399 --> 01:50:18.000]  And again, folks, we're going to skip this network break to go right back to your calls and news.
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:27.763]  But I started promoting these a year and a half ago and thought they were good vitamins and stuff, but saw what Aaron had happened, what my mother had happened, so now I'm fully behind it, as you know.
[01:50:27.763 --> 01:50:29.524]  And here are my essential fatty acids.
[01:50:29.524 --> 01:50:31.784]  I'm going to take two of these now.
[01:50:31.784 --> 01:50:33.585]  And again, you're hungry?
[01:50:33.585 --> 01:50:40.647]  Just take their proprietary blend of that with the Rabble Rouser, the
[01:50:42.298 --> 01:50:44.999]  Pollen Burst Mix with Beyond Tangy Tangerine and I'm good.
[01:50:44.999 --> 01:50:50.441]  You know what's even more exciting about it?
[01:50:50.441 --> 01:50:58.044]  I sleep good at night promoting things that I believe in and we win, win, win.
[01:50:58.044 --> 01:51:02.086]  People try these products, find out I'm not hyping it, and they love the show even more.
[01:51:03.083 --> 01:51:07.466]  Because occasionally, you know, every few weeks, I'll do a little infomercial here for a few minutes.
[01:51:07.466 --> 01:51:10.788]  Other talk show hosts have constant plugs in and out of every break.
[01:51:10.788 --> 01:51:12.128]  We don't really do that.
[01:51:12.128 --> 01:51:15.611]  But occasionally, I will sit here and tell you about stuff that is funding our operation.
[01:51:15.611 --> 01:51:20.854]  You can also be a distributor and get discounts at Infowarsteam.com.
[01:51:20.854 --> 01:51:22.195]  There's also a phone number.
[01:51:22.195 --> 01:51:24.956]  Now, we are going to post that video of your radio lister.
[01:51:24.956 --> 01:51:26.117]  Want to see that video?
[01:51:26.117 --> 01:51:27.598]  It's going to go up in the next 10 minutes.
[01:51:29.994 --> 01:51:31.135]  What should the headline be?
[01:51:31.135 --> 01:51:36.218]  Aaron Dyke's Info Warrior Loses 92 Pounds with Vitamins and Minerals Secret.
[01:51:36.218 --> 01:51:39.000]  Vitamin and Minerals Secret.
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.642]  Or Seek, you know, The Secrets.
[01:51:41.642 --> 01:51:42.322]  It is The Secrets.
[01:51:42.322 --> 01:51:44.464]  They don't want you to know.
[01:51:44.464 --> 01:51:46.765]  Vitamin and Minerals Secret.
[01:51:46.765 --> 01:51:48.587]  You know, Keto Weight Loss.
[01:51:48.587 --> 01:51:50.728]  I mean, I think that's the headline.
[01:51:50.728 --> 01:51:52.870]  And it's all hiding there in plain view.
[01:51:52.870 --> 01:51:55.711]  Alright, I'm done ranting about it.
[01:51:55.711 --> 01:51:57.052]  We produced that video.
[01:51:57.052 --> 01:51:58.794]  We wanted to do the before and after shots.
[01:52:00.178 --> 01:52:01.799]  I mean, I'm still a little bit chubby, folks.
[01:52:01.799 --> 01:52:05.061]  Y'all have seen me before, on the video, before I lost 40 pounds.
[01:52:05.061 --> 01:52:08.063]  People are like, you lost 40 pounds, you still look a little chubby.
[01:52:08.063 --> 01:52:09.664]  Not really standing up, but sitting down.
[01:52:09.664 --> 01:52:11.084]  Yeah, I've still got a bit of a belly.
[01:52:11.084 --> 01:52:12.465]  No, I lost 40 pounds.
[01:52:12.465 --> 01:52:13.546]  40 plus.
[01:52:13.546 --> 01:52:16.948]  Gained about 10 back, just because I forget to take the stuff.
[01:52:16.948 --> 01:52:18.749]  I already just said that in the video, didn't I?
[01:52:19.554 --> 01:52:21.134]  The point is, it really works.
[01:52:21.134 --> 01:52:23.435]  Infowarsteam.com.
[01:52:23.435 --> 01:52:24.615]  Okay, enough of that.
[01:52:24.615 --> 01:52:25.875]  We got Lou Rockwell coming up.
[01:52:25.875 --> 01:52:36.777]  I want to go to a bunch of your calls, get to everybody who's been holding right now on all the issues you want to raise, and then we'll get to some of the other big top stories dealing with Election 2012 and more.
[01:52:36.777 --> 01:52:40.158]  Trey in South Carolina, thanks for holding, you're on the air.
[01:52:40.158 --> 01:52:42.238]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:52:42.238 --> 01:52:45.559]  I wanted to touch on a couple things.
[01:52:45.559 --> 01:52:46.879]  Mainly, right now, it's
[01:52:48.035 --> 01:52:57.645]  Something I noticed within the past few days is I don't really watch too much television, but when I do, I guess after you're awake, it's so easy to catch everything.
[01:52:57.645 --> 01:53:01.128]  Yeah, it's cartoon level brainwashing, all anti-fans.
[01:53:01.128 --> 01:53:06.954]  I mean, it would be like a movie made 50 years ago of people watching TV in a future police state.
[01:53:06.954 --> 01:53:09.196]  This is what the TV would look like.
[01:53:09.196 --> 01:53:11.498]  And that's exactly what I wanted to touch on.
[01:53:13.214 --> 01:53:22.260]  I guess after you're awake and you can see it, it's so blatant that they're, what they're putting out there for you and it's, it's really disgusting.
[01:53:22.260 --> 01:53:38.210]  Um, I, I actually have a fellow info warrior that lives right across the street from me and we hang out quite often and he showed me this movie and I mean this, this is basically a blueprint of what you talk about of how the CIA works and uses patsies.
[01:53:38.874 --> 01:53:42.496]  But, um, and the messages in this movie are just ridiculous.
[01:53:42.496 --> 01:53:48.800]  If you're awake and you can see past everything, it's a movie called Rampage and it came out back in 2009.
[01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:59.227]  And I don't know if you've seen it, but if you have, you'd instantly be just, you know, I mean dumbfounded at what they're putting in this movie.
[01:53:59.864 --> 01:54:02.446]  Yeah, and all these young people they're trying to hire.
[01:54:02.446 --> 01:54:05.207]  The CIA is basically tripling its size right now.
[01:54:05.207 --> 01:54:09.210]  They're being picked to be patsies and idiots and morons and useful idiots.
[01:54:09.210 --> 01:54:13.352]  And you have the criminals on top laughing at all the patsies below them.
[01:54:13.352 --> 01:54:15.213]  I mean, it's all a big joke.
[01:54:15.213 --> 01:54:16.895]  It's all about compartmentalization.
[01:54:16.895 --> 01:54:22.318]  It's all about using patriots who go on these dangerous missions and get killed.
[01:54:22.318 --> 01:54:26.661]  If you want to know how they set people up, watch Mark Wahlberg's The Shooter.
[01:54:27.641 --> 01:54:40.566]  That film is so accurate compared to real events and things that have happened that I've, I think I've even told the producer, when I saw that a few years ago, I want to get the producer of that film on if we can.
[01:54:40.566 --> 01:54:42.306]  I bet money they're a listener.
[01:54:42.306 --> 01:54:48.448]  Because, you know, some films have propaganda in them and we who are awake see them and think, oh, they're warning people.
[01:54:48.448 --> 01:54:49.229]  No, no, no, no.
[01:54:49.229 --> 01:54:52.730]  They're targeting people that are unconscious and conditioning them.
[01:54:52.730 --> 01:54:55.111]  But some films like The Shooter,
[01:54:55.991 --> 01:54:58.091]  Oh, that's made by Patriots.
[01:54:58.091 --> 01:55:05.853]  That is one of the only wholesome, good message films I have ever seen in modern history out of Hollywood.
[01:55:05.853 --> 01:55:07.753]  In fact, guys, look up who produced that.
[01:55:07.753 --> 01:55:09.594]  I want to give them kudos right here.
[01:55:09.594 --> 01:55:11.254]  Ought to be some evil person.
[01:55:11.254 --> 01:55:12.274]  I forget.
[01:55:12.274 --> 01:55:17.415]  But listen, I've met with a lot of big Hollywood people and they say, look, we're awake.
[01:55:17.415 --> 01:55:18.795]  We know what's going on.
[01:55:18.795 --> 01:55:20.716]  We can't get our stuff through the
[01:55:23.507 --> 01:55:26.868]  You know, big production companies, if we don't play ball.
[01:55:26.868 --> 01:55:36.312]  It doesn't matter how good the script is, how many actors are lined up for it, and then the Department of Defense comes in and demands stuff be put in things, even if their stuff isn't being used.
[01:55:36.312 --> 01:55:38.553]  What type of things are in the movie?
[01:55:38.553 --> 01:55:52.718]  Well, um, basically it's attacking, uh, I guess a guy, he makes a rant on YouTube and he's talking about how basically what's wrong with our world and the ego has been taken over
[01:55:53.722 --> 01:56:06.380]  And his best friend has been ordering, you know, supplies, you know, SWAT gear, basically, and the plot of the movie is this guy just randomly goes out and just starts killing people on the street.
[01:56:06.380 --> 01:56:07.682]  I mean, for no apparent reason.
[01:56:07.682 --> 01:56:09.905]  Yeah, well, see, humans, humans, when they're unconscious...
[01:56:10.646 --> 01:56:12.367]  Our social animals.
[01:56:12.367 --> 01:56:13.368]  And they know this.
[01:56:13.368 --> 01:56:20.452]  I mean, if you showed famous people jumping off cliffs, other people would go do it immediately.
[01:56:20.452 --> 01:56:23.033]  I mean, they tell women it's sexy to get abortions.
[01:56:23.033 --> 01:56:26.475]  Some women like to get pregnant and have abortions, believe it or not.
[01:56:26.475 --> 01:56:29.097]  You can look at it because it's so cool to do it.
[01:56:29.097 --> 01:56:33.820]  It's like some gay men like to get HIV because they're called bug chasers.
[01:56:34.620 --> 01:56:42.065]  Even Rolling Stone has talked about it, where they'll go out and try to find someone who has HIV, and in a weird religious ceremony, they describe it.
[01:56:42.065 --> 01:56:47.729]  Like a religious ceremony, they go, give me the bug, make me cool.
[01:56:47.729 --> 01:56:49.971]  They have arms, legs chopped off to be trendy.
[01:56:49.971 --> 01:56:52.953]  I'm not joking, that mutilation's getting real popular.
[01:56:52.953 --> 01:56:58.917]  So yeah, they have lots of movies with mass shooters, where mentally ill people see that and then go out and become mass shooters.
[01:56:58.917 --> 01:56:59.257]  Go ahead.
[01:57:00.094 --> 01:57:03.556]  And that's, yeah, exactly what we were pointing out while watching the movie.
[01:57:03.556 --> 01:57:08.398]  I was telling my friend that he's well awake and listens to your show too.
[01:57:08.398 --> 01:57:17.541]  But at the very end of the movie, like I said, he basically set up his best friend to be the Patsy and he does get away, the actual shooter.
[01:57:17.541 --> 01:57:21.063]  And then two years later, after the fact of all that happening,
[01:57:21.750 --> 01:57:38.975]  His message, he posted a video after he gets away, and he posts a video at the end of the movie, and the end of the, like, the message at the end of the movie is talking about, he basically says, there are too many people on this world, and, you know, we need to depopulize, and that's why, what's going on.
[01:57:38.975 --> 01:57:43.177]  Sir, it's everywhere, it's everywhere, I appreciate your call, uh, great points.
[01:57:43.177 --> 01:57:47.598]  Uh, Antoni, is that how you pronounce it?
[01:57:48.712 --> 01:58:00.422]  Antoine Fakula, I suddenly can't read anything, Antoine Fakula attended West Virginia University in Morganstown, West Virginia on Atlantic scholarship for basketball.
[01:58:00.422 --> 01:58:02.144]  He studied electrical engineering.
[01:58:02.144 --> 01:58:03.765]  Are you sure this is the director of that movie?
[01:58:10.111 --> 01:58:11.451]  Anton Fokua.
[01:58:11.451 --> 01:58:13.432]  So he just came out of nowhere and made this film.
[01:58:13.432 --> 01:58:13.972]  Well, no wonder.
[01:58:13.972 --> 01:58:15.733]  I don't know how he got it made.
[01:58:15.733 --> 01:58:17.333]  I bet Mark Wahlberg's a patriot.
[01:58:17.333 --> 01:58:18.214]  I can just tell you by reading.
[01:58:18.214 --> 01:58:20.374]  Well, he's a great director as well.
[01:58:20.374 --> 01:58:22.955]  And again, I don't want to meet famous people just because they're famous.
[01:58:22.955 --> 01:58:26.396]  I want to meet with Mark Wahlberg because he's a great director.
[01:58:26.396 --> 01:58:30.437]  He's made some really good movies and a great actor, and he's obviously a patriot.
[01:58:30.437 --> 01:58:33.978]  And I guess he liked it, so he let a director who didn't really know him do it.
[01:58:33.978 --> 01:58:34.879]  So there you go.
[01:58:34.879 --> 01:58:37.559]  Anton Fokua did Shooter.
[01:58:37.559 --> 01:58:38.800]  Well, I want you on the show, buddy.

[01:59:25.458 --> 01:59:25.778]  I think so.
[01:59:53.863 --> 01:59:56.243]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.243 --> 02:00:05.605]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.605 --> 02:00:06.905]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.905 --> 02:00:08.686]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.686 --> 02:00:10.426]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.426 --> 02:00:12.006]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.006 --> 02:00:13.947]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.947 --> 02:00:17.747]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.747 --> 02:00:21.828]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.728 --> 02:00:30.190]  Yeah, that director we were just talking about that did Shooter.
[02:00:30.190 --> 02:00:31.732]  It's not these shooters, Shooter.
[02:00:31.732 --> 02:00:36.857]  Also did Training Day, which exposes the corrupt system.
[02:00:36.857 --> 02:00:45.826]  Which is one of the films where it shows the police dealing drugs at the top, and just shutting down one of their minions instead of it being, you know, just a few bad cops.
[02:00:45.826 --> 02:00:49.669]  Anyways, if you just joined us, I was talking about a director of the Shooter, or Shooter.
[02:00:50.936 --> 02:00:53.158]  We're taking your phone calls right now ahead of Lou Rockwell.
[02:00:53.158 --> 02:01:01.907]  I'm going to cover a laundry list of news for them and look at election 2012 with Ron Paul's former chief of staff and the head of the Von Mies Institute, always informative.
[02:01:01.907 --> 02:01:05.511]  I got Webster Griffin Tarpley with the big government view.
[02:01:05.511 --> 02:01:07.353]  We're going to have the little government view here in a minute.
[02:01:08.253 --> 02:01:08.874]  Hi Alex, how are you doing?
[02:01:08.874 --> 02:01:11.356]  Hey, I was watching Ken Burns' documentary on the Civil War the other day.
[02:01:37.572 --> 02:01:46.715]  In the documentary they talked about the two economies, the union economy and the confederate economy, and they said the union economy was strong because the greenback dollar was backed by gold.
[02:01:46.715 --> 02:01:51.396]  They said the confederate money, their economy, it was all printed out of thin air.
[02:01:51.396 --> 02:02:01.959]  They said pretty soon inflation took off in the confederacy and the riots broke out in the major cities and they said Jeff Davis had to divert troops from the war to put down the riots in the cities.
[02:02:02.642 --> 02:02:04.864]  Jefferson Davis, yep.
[02:02:04.864 --> 02:02:12.350]  And now we have that same money, and the banks have signed us on to hundreds of times what we owe, but we're not supposed to be upset about that.
[02:02:12.350 --> 02:02:13.310]  We're in a free country.
[02:02:13.310 --> 02:02:16.053]  Just let the TSA fondle you.
[02:02:16.053 --> 02:02:19.035]  Basically, we got Confederate money in our wallets right now.
[02:02:19.035 --> 02:02:20.636]  Nothing backing it.
[02:02:20.636 --> 02:02:25.560]  Yep, and the globalists are creeping towards the exits, but we're not supposed to point that out, John.
[02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:26.301]  That's fear-mongering.
[02:02:27.887 --> 02:02:33.671]  And you gotta remember, the reason they're getting ready now is because the reason they had to put down the rest back then, they know what's coming.
[02:02:33.671 --> 02:02:38.374]  That's why they got all the military and everything all geared up, ready to go.
[02:02:38.374 --> 02:02:43.757]  That's right, brother, and only exposing them will make them not accelerate the implosion.
[02:02:43.757 --> 02:02:48.079]  The question is, is it too late for even the globalists to stop what they've put in motion?
[02:02:48.079 --> 02:02:49.300]  Great points.
[02:02:49.300 --> 02:02:51.822]  Merlin!
[02:02:51.822 --> 02:02:52.983]  Hello, Mr. Pendragon.
[02:02:52.983 --> 02:02:54.784]  Good to have you on the show with us from Washington.
[02:02:54.784 --> 02:02:55.104]  Welcome.
[02:02:56.253 --> 02:03:00.415]  Yes, I was listening to your guest yesterday.
[02:03:00.415 --> 02:03:00.755]  Yes.
[02:03:00.755 --> 02:03:01.575]  On taxes.
[02:03:01.575 --> 02:03:03.036]  Yes, sir.
[02:03:03.036 --> 02:03:14.341]  And anyway, I didn't have an opportunity to ask my question, but I was concerned about Social Security.
[02:03:14.341 --> 02:03:19.663]  Where does the Social Security money go to that we pay in?
[02:03:20.382 --> 02:03:21.443]  It's gone.
[02:03:21.443 --> 02:03:22.864]  It goes into the general fund.
[02:03:22.864 --> 02:03:25.125]  They have IOUs and another fund.
[02:03:25.125 --> 02:03:26.866]  Just digital money.
[02:03:26.866 --> 02:03:31.710]  But they spend it all faster than it comes in.
[02:03:31.710 --> 02:03:33.391]  Is it spent the same way as taxes?
[02:03:35.118 --> 02:03:42.063]  Actually, the Social Security money does end up getting spent on government functions, strangely enough, at least part of it.
[02:03:42.063 --> 02:03:50.308]  The income tax portion, though, all goes to interest on the debt, because the bankers get interest for the right of us just to have fiat currency.
[02:03:50.308 --> 02:03:52.129]  So it's even worse than a fiat currency.
[02:03:52.129 --> 02:03:56.492]  It's a debt-based, where every dollar that's created, we go into debt to the banksters.
[02:03:56.492 --> 02:04:03.036]  So I guess there's not much we can do about it right now, right?
[02:04:03.854 --> 02:04:08.359]  Well, sir, exposing a fraud will bring it down.
[02:04:08.359 --> 02:04:09.640]  We're in a lot of trouble.
[02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:11.722]  We're morally bankrupt.
[02:04:11.722 --> 02:04:12.963]  We've been taken over.
[02:04:12.963 --> 02:04:18.188]  They've set up a paramilitary group against us, but we're trying to wake up those enforcers.
[02:04:18.188 --> 02:04:20.310]  Not because we can't beat them militarily.
[02:04:20.310 --> 02:04:22.773]  That's part of the globalist plan.
[02:04:22.773 --> 02:04:24.835]  We don't want to have a civil war in this country.
[02:04:24.835 --> 02:04:26.116]  We want to try to turn things around.
[02:04:26.116 --> 02:04:26.597]  What do you say?
[02:04:28.101 --> 02:04:29.062]  Well, that's for sure.
[02:04:29.062 --> 02:04:36.251]  I'm part of the baby boom generation, and I'm concerned about, you know, Social Security for us.
[02:04:36.251 --> 02:04:41.456]  Yeah, that's what this implosion's all about, is making sure you don't get the money you paid in.
[02:04:41.456 --> 02:04:45.121]  And you're going to end up getting your money, it's just going to be devalued.
[02:04:46.752 --> 02:04:47.472]  That's the problem.
[02:04:47.472 --> 02:04:51.514]  If we continue on this course, because we're not bankrupt because of social security.
[02:04:51.514 --> 02:04:56.836]  We're bankrupt because of the globalists and their Ponzi schemes and their derivatives.
[02:04:56.836 --> 02:04:59.117]  But if we keep on this course, you're going to not get anything.
[02:05:03.064 --> 02:05:11.191]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.
[02:05:11.191 --> 02:05:15.254]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.
[02:05:15.254 --> 02:05:22.561]  These all-natural soaps are made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils that are earth-friendly and safe.
[02:05:22.561 --> 02:05:25.383]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com.

[02:05:36.370 --> 02:05:41.774]  Or save big with a 1 to 2 year supply of soaps for all your cleaning needs.
[02:05:41.774 --> 02:05:43.755]  This is an amazing deal.
[02:05:43.755 --> 02:05:48.999]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.
[02:05:48.999 --> 02:05:52.141]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com or call

[02:06:00.683 --> 02:06:06.827]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[02:06:06.827 --> 02:06:09.789]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[02:06:09.789 --> 02:06:15.172]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[02:06:15.172 --> 02:06:20.155]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[02:06:20.155 --> 02:06:27.460]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods or meat foods direct now.
[02:06:27.780 --> 02:06:31.642]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[02:06:31.642 --> 02:06:33.443]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:06:33.443 --> 02:06:37.465]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we have all known this was coming.
[02:06:37.465 --> 02:06:40.366]  You know about their delicious, long-term, storable foods.
[02:06:40.366 --> 02:06:43.148]  The fact is, you can eat at any time to save money today.
[02:06:43.148 --> 02:06:47.710]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[02:06:47.710 --> 02:06:48.370]  Don't wait!
[02:06:48.370 --> 02:06:48.610]  Call 800-409-5633.
[02:06:48.610 --> 02:06:50.251]  Or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:06:50.251 --> 02:06:50.391]  Call 800-409-5633.
[02:06:58.276 --> 02:07:07.705]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid, and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[02:07:07.705 --> 02:07:12.949]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[02:07:12.949 --> 02:07:15.191]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[02:07:15.191 --> 02:07:22.698]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[02:07:23.178 --> 02:07:26.980]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[02:07:26.980 --> 02:07:31.342]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[02:07:31.342 --> 02:07:38.205]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling Power Hub unit.
[02:07:38.205 --> 02:07:41.247]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[02:07:41.247 --> 02:07:44.348]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[02:07:44.348 --> 02:07:48.090]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar-powered.
[02:07:48.090 --> 02:07:50.571]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[02:07:51.111 --> 02:07:56.213]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[02:07:56.213 --> 02:08:01.355]  That's BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[02:08:01.355 --> 02:08:06.958]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:28.513 --> 02:08:30.874]  And we are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:30.874 --> 02:08:36.375]  Our story is on the right-hand side, top story of DrugsReport.com.
[02:08:36.375 --> 02:08:42.996]  I keep saying right-hand side, it's on the left-hand side of DrugsReport.com.
[02:08:42.996 --> 02:08:51.258]  And it deals with the fact of the National Weather Service and huge ammo purchase.
[02:08:51.258 --> 02:08:54.239]  Now, I talked about the fact that
[02:08:55.678 --> 02:09:10.643]  NOAA controls the Fisheries Office of Law Enforcement, and we've had guests on about how they're harassing surfers on the West Coast and telling people they can't have jet skis in the water now, and all the rest of it, for the marine mammals.
[02:09:10.643 --> 02:09:13.084]  And they're harassing people with boats, you name it.
[02:09:13.084 --> 02:09:15.165]  So I said, hey, I bet it's going to them.
[02:09:15.165 --> 02:09:17.666]  They're sending it to the West Coast, the East Coast.
[02:09:17.666 --> 02:09:23.608]  This is on top of the 1.4 billion rounds of ammo
[02:09:25.148 --> 02:09:29.949]  That the federal government has purchased last year.
[02:09:29.949 --> 02:09:39.372]  $250 million last year, $450 million five months ago, $750 million last week.
[02:09:39.372 --> 02:09:42.112]  But as usual, they're countering us.
[02:09:42.112 --> 02:09:45.193]  And listen to this, the Washington Post.
[02:09:45.193 --> 02:09:49.754]  National Weather Service ammunition solicitation triggers confusion.
[02:09:49.754 --> 02:09:52.375]  And we're gonna go to our guest, NOAA.
[02:09:53.826 --> 02:10:02.631]  Says there was a clerical error in the FedBizOpps announcement stating that the National Weather Service requested ammunition.
[02:10:02.631 --> 02:10:08.715]  The solicitation actually originated from NOAA Fisheries Office of Law Enforcement.
[02:10:08.715 --> 02:10:09.155]  Yeah.
[02:10:09.155 --> 02:10:10.776]  15 to 25,000 rounds per office.
[02:10:10.776 --> 02:10:11.497]  That's listed there.
[02:10:12.432 --> 02:10:13.934]  Not the National Weather Service.
[02:10:13.934 --> 02:10:16.276]  See bottom of post for more details.
[02:10:16.276 --> 02:10:18.278]  Yeah, but it's under the National Weather Service.
[02:10:18.278 --> 02:10:19.419]  It's not a clerical error.
[02:10:19.419 --> 02:10:21.801]  They've always got to play a game to change the subject.
[02:10:21.801 --> 02:10:23.923]  There's 1.4 billion rounds.
[02:10:23.923 --> 02:10:26.525]  This is on top of that.
[02:10:26.525 --> 02:10:27.306]  Original post.
[02:10:27.306 --> 02:10:29.508]  Weather forecasting or preparing for war.
[02:10:29.508 --> 02:10:31.810]  The National Weather Service seeks to buy 4,600
[02:10:35.265 --> 02:10:44.190]  46,000 rounds of ammunition for semi-automatic pistols, says FedBiz website, in a solicitation head scratcher of explosive proportions.
[02:10:44.190 --> 02:10:45.391]  Well, no it's not.
[02:10:45.391 --> 02:10:47.352]  The IRS just created a huge SWAT team.
[02:10:47.352 --> 02:10:51.375]  InfoWars, the website of Libertarian talk show host, hey, they actually got it right.
[02:10:51.375 --> 02:10:58.019]  Alex Jones, because usually if there's a Republican in, I'm a hardcore communist, the news says, because I don't like the Republicans.
[02:10:59.625 --> 02:11:01.966]  Or, if there's a Democrat in, I'm a right-wing extremist.
[02:11:01.966 --> 02:11:04.147]  No, I'm just a constitutionalist libertarian.
[02:11:04.147 --> 02:11:05.888]  Freedom lover.
[02:11:05.888 --> 02:11:13.851]  He goes on InfoWars, the website of libertarian talk show host, Alex Jones says the ammunition being ordered is designed to cause maximum organ damage.
[02:11:13.851 --> 02:11:15.032]  And it goes on to quote us.
[02:11:16.761 --> 02:11:23.565]  So again, now the National Weather Service is responding to the Washington Post and Drudge Report picking up our story.
[02:11:23.565 --> 02:11:27.848]  That's a good place to start with Lou Rockwell of lourockwell.com.
[02:11:27.848 --> 02:11:32.491]  Author, researcher, runs the very popular lourockwell.com.
[02:11:32.491 --> 02:11:37.714]  They have an article out about licensing of gardens and lemonade stands in this great free nation we live in.
[02:11:38.254 --> 02:11:45.079]  And he's an American libertarian political commentator, activist, proponent of the Austrian School of Economics, and chair of the Ludwig von Mies Institute.
[02:11:45.079 --> 02:11:48.561]  He was also Ron Paul's congressional chief of staff.
[02:11:48.561 --> 02:11:53.304]  And he joins us right now to break all of this down.
[02:11:53.304 --> 02:11:55.005]  Some of the news stories on the site today.
[02:11:55.005 --> 02:11:57.467]  Blaming guns and other inanimate objects.
[02:11:57.467 --> 02:12:02.150]  80 million zombies wrecking the Arab world, promoting crime in schools.
[02:12:02.150 --> 02:12:03.431]  Get your money out now.
[02:12:03.431 --> 02:12:06.773]  Ron Paul's offenses against the state religion.
[02:12:06.773 --> 02:12:07.974]  The ghost of Joe McCarthy.
[02:12:09.716 --> 02:12:17.263]  All Ryan's principles saying no to government loyalty of the crown of self-control who killed the Limbaugh the Lindbergh baby
[02:12:18.069 --> 02:12:19.450]  They wreak havoc on your health.
[02:12:19.450 --> 02:12:20.450]  That's a few good articles.
[02:12:20.450 --> 02:12:25.153]  I ought to ask him what those are all about, even though I've read a couple of them today and linked to them at Infowars.com.
[02:12:25.153 --> 02:12:28.135]  He joins us now looking at this.
[02:12:28.135 --> 02:12:44.644]  Lou, what do you make of checkpoints everywhere, TSA on the highways everywhere, warrantless checkpoints, TSA grabbing people's laptops and downloading the contents, police doing it, the general unfolding police state, drones all over the place.
[02:12:44.644 --> 02:12:46.746]  I videotaped one last week in Austin.
[02:12:47.686 --> 02:12:50.189]  Flying around, surveilling things.
[02:12:50.189 --> 02:12:58.138]  And 1.4 billion, I keep saying million, 1.4 billion rounds of ammunition purchased in the last year.
[02:12:58.138 --> 02:13:03.144]  I looked it up, that's about 10 times what DHS purchased in previous years.
[02:13:03.144 --> 02:13:06.688]  What are they getting ready for Blue Rockwell?
[02:13:07.605 --> 02:13:13.307]  Well, Alex, of course, that's more than four bullets per person in this country.
[02:13:13.307 --> 02:13:16.929]  They're worried about insurrection.
[02:13:16.929 --> 02:13:28.553]  Because as the government keeps getting more and more controlling, whether you're talking about everything from the fisheries, to the highways, to schools, homes, businesses, churches,
[02:13:29.553 --> 02:13:52.249]  Charities, they're taking more and more control, and of course, as the government gets bigger, it gets worse, it gets morally worse, and the people who rise to the top of the government become even worse, they become even more monstrous, and so they want more and more control, this is what they live for, they love doing this to people, they love crushing people, they love killing people, that's why they love wars so much, besides all the money they make.
[02:13:52.729 --> 02:13:55.392]  So they, they're, but they also get more paranoid.
[02:13:55.392 --> 02:14:02.277]  They're constantly afraid that, you know, they're sort of like fleas on a dog, and they're always afraid that maybe the dog's going to scratch them off.
[02:14:02.277 --> 02:14:02.458]  So...
[02:14:03.710 --> 02:14:05.131]  They arm themselves.
[02:14:05.131 --> 02:14:07.411]  And they have, you know, all these armored SWAT teams.
[02:14:07.411 --> 02:14:13.233]  Every government agency has got armored SWAT teams, as you so correctly point out.
[02:14:13.233 --> 02:14:14.573]  So the government is our enemy.
[02:14:14.573 --> 02:14:16.794]  I mean, I think that's what we have to realize.
[02:14:16.794 --> 02:14:25.037]  These people are not getting all these bullets to, quote-unquote, defend us, or protect us, or the rest of the myths that they put out in Washington.
[02:14:25.037 --> 02:14:25.897]  It's to hurt us.
[02:14:26.577 --> 02:14:28.039]  If we don't obey.
[02:14:28.039 --> 02:14:30.061]  So that's what they're afraid of.
[02:14:30.061 --> 02:14:33.585]  And they're continuing to turn the screws.
[02:14:33.585 --> 02:14:35.347]  So this is of course what we all fight about.
[02:14:35.347 --> 02:14:36.728]  This is what you fight against every day.
[02:14:36.728 --> 02:14:37.850]  Me too.
[02:14:37.850 --> 02:14:44.317]  And so many other Americans are not willing to put up with this stuff that bothers the people in government.
[02:14:44.317 --> 02:14:46.179]  And they turn to violence.
[02:14:47.290 --> 02:14:51.674]  Whenever we think of, whenever I think of the one, they use the word tool.
[02:14:51.674 --> 02:14:53.556]  You know, they always talk about their tool kit.
[02:14:53.556 --> 02:14:55.218]  They want another tool.
[02:14:55.218 --> 02:14:56.859]  The tool is the gun.
[02:14:56.859 --> 02:14:59.262]  So that's their one and only tool.
[02:14:59.262 --> 02:15:05.989]  Whether you refuse to pay or maybe forget to pay your library fine, and then you sufficiently resist paying the library fine.
[02:15:06.209 --> 02:15:09.251]  They claim the right to kill you over not paying your library fine.
[02:15:09.251 --> 02:15:13.654]  And of course everything else that they... Look at any document the government has you sign.
[02:15:13.654 --> 02:15:14.795]  It's menacing.
[02:15:14.795 --> 02:15:16.316]  It's predatory.
[02:15:16.316 --> 02:15:18.738]  They threaten to put you in jail over anything.
[02:15:18.738 --> 02:15:20.139]  This is a very nasty institution.
[02:15:20.139 --> 02:15:23.161]  They behave like the mafia because they are the biggest mafia.
[02:15:23.786 --> 02:15:24.746]  Well, don't criticize.
[02:15:24.746 --> 02:15:28.989]  At least the Mafia gives us products that people want to buy voluntarily.
[02:15:28.989 --> 02:15:31.750]  I think the government's far worse than the Mafia.
[02:15:31.750 --> 02:15:36.552]  Far more nasty, far more vicious, murdered infinitely more people than the Mafia.
[02:15:36.552 --> 02:15:37.273]  I guess you're right.
[02:15:37.273 --> 02:15:37.733]  No, you're right.
[02:15:37.733 --> 02:15:47.597]  Government killed, according to the University of Hawaii study, 262 million people in the 20th century, not counting military deaths or deaths by military.
[02:15:47.597 --> 02:15:48.778]  I mean, that's more than anything.
[02:15:48.778 --> 02:15:50.439]  I mean, government's more deadly than cancer.
[02:15:51.343 --> 02:15:55.125]  Well, you know, people, I always think Dick Cheney showed this, but they're all like this.
[02:15:55.125 --> 02:15:56.805]  They like killing people.
[02:15:56.805 --> 02:15:59.066]  You know, they like sending in the predator drones.
[02:15:59.066 --> 02:16:00.567]  Obama must enjoy that.
[02:16:00.567 --> 02:16:05.349]  Maybe he does it over his cereal in the morning, signs the death order, gets a kick out of it.
[02:16:05.996 --> 02:16:09.821]  People who rise to the top in government like killing other people.
[02:16:09.821 --> 02:16:22.098]  It's a tough thing for the normal person, who of course would never in a million years want to kill anybody else, but the people who rise to the top of government are killers, they're looters, they're very bad people.
[02:16:22.278 --> 02:16:29.182]  Of course, that's what our founding fathers said, and we tried to follow their system, and it wasn't perfect, but it created more wealth than any other nation ever had.
[02:16:29.182 --> 02:16:32.845]  Four percent of the world's population, we had more than half the wealth.
[02:16:32.845 --> 02:16:37.408]  Now, as the liberty goes out the door, like oxygen, our prosperity's going out.
[02:16:37.408 --> 02:16:47.154]  I want to pull back and look at the big picture, and then I want to get into Paul Ryan, Ron Paul, a whole bunch of articles, drones, with Lou Rockwell, the icon from lourockwell.com.
[02:16:47.154 --> 02:16:47.835]  But first,
[02:16:48.968 --> 02:16:54.512]  I want to go to the fact, we have an article out at Infowars.com today, Rome burned, will we?
[02:16:54.512 --> 02:16:58.834]  By the way, LewRockwell.com is always welcome to carry any of our stuff if you want, we'd be honored.
[02:16:58.834 --> 02:17:05.819]  But I want to get your take on this, because I know you've written and talked about this, the parallels to the United States Empire and Rome.
[02:17:05.819 --> 02:17:12.723]  Give us your own historical and economically studied perspective on Rome burned, will we?
[02:17:13.669 --> 02:17:18.431]  Well, you know, of course, this is something that you mentioned, the Founding Fathers, they were very, very aware of.
[02:17:18.431 --> 02:17:28.255]  They, in many ways, sought to emulate the heroes of Republican Rome, and were very much concerned about what happened when they developed into a vicious empire.
[02:17:28.255 --> 02:17:41.981]  So, yeah, I mean, there are parallels, and they aren't exact, but with empire comes corruption, comes destruction, comes economic destruction, comes poverty.
[02:17:42.802 --> 02:17:43.382]  I think so.
[02:18:03.383 --> 02:18:08.067]  Which, you know, despite all the wars it wages, is not very good at them.
[02:18:08.067 --> 02:18:22.618]  It has like a gigantic World War II-style military that can't handle guys with AK-47s in Afghanistan, who've got, you know, no drones, no planes, no tanks, you know, none of the equipment, none of the electronic surveillance equipment and so forth, and yet they can't beat them.
[02:18:23.178 --> 02:18:26.841]  So, this is, I think, a sign of things to come.
[02:18:26.841 --> 02:18:31.204]  Romney and Obama, I think, are going to give us more wars.
[02:18:31.204 --> 02:18:35.067]  Probably, I think, Romney worse than Obama in the foreign policy area.
[02:18:35.067 --> 02:18:36.228]  Hard as that is to believe.
[02:18:36.228 --> 02:18:39.771]  And, of course, Paul Ryan, too.
[02:18:39.771 --> 02:18:41.192]  So, yeah, we headed down.
[02:18:41.192 --> 02:18:46.616]  And when Rome fell, you know, there was a very long period of decivilization.
[02:18:46.616 --> 02:18:48.077]  It took a long time to build back up.
[02:18:49.009 --> 02:18:58.454]  It also happened when trade collapsed in the whole Mediterranean world because of the fights between the Muslims and the Christians.
[02:18:58.454 --> 02:19:00.935]  So things go on for a very long time.
[02:19:00.935 --> 02:19:03.236]  It took a long time to rebuild.
[02:19:03.236 --> 02:19:05.918]  We have to hope that we're not going to end up in that sort of situation.
[02:19:05.918 --> 02:19:07.499]  But already, of course, we're poorer.
[02:19:07.499 --> 02:19:16.803]  Really, if you look at things with a done-johndist eye and pay no attention to government propaganda, the average American family is no better off today than they were in the early 1970s.
[02:19:18.439 --> 02:19:19.980]  In real terms.
[02:19:19.980 --> 02:19:34.509]  And that was when Nixon took us off the remnants of the gold standard, gave us the full fiat money, paper money, you know, baloney money system that we are suffering under, the whole world suffers under today, and is probably going to bring us all down today, or in the near future.
[02:19:34.509 --> 02:19:35.530]  Lew Rockwell, stay there.
[02:19:35.530 --> 02:19:44.896]  I want to come back and look at the world financial crisis, and banks are told, get ready for collapse, government can't help you, prepare yourselves.
[02:19:44.896 --> 02:19:47.238]  Why we see all this scurrying around, as you point out,
[02:19:48.018 --> 02:19:50.460]  Our so-called military couldn't even hold Baghdad.
[02:19:50.460 --> 02:20:00.007]  How are they going to hold the United States, no matter how many billions of rounds of ammunition the bureaucrats have, with big sis up there waddling around?
[02:20:02.344 --> 02:20:06.185]  In this unpredictable world, disaster can strike anyone.
[02:20:06.185 --> 02:20:12.527]  That's why an essential part of any emergency survival plan must be stove-in-a-can.
[02:20:12.527 --> 02:20:22.209]  When power goes out and gas lines are down, the portable, safe, easy-to-use stove-in-a-can cooks food up to four hours and boils water in as little as five minutes.

[02:22:07.213 --> 02:22:16.360]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[02:22:16.360 --> 02:22:23.065]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[02:22:23.065 --> 02:22:25.267]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[02:22:25.267 --> 02:22:30.351]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[02:22:31.071 --> 02:22:39.013]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.

[02:24:24.485 --> 02:24:26.766]  Lou Rockwell is our guest.
[02:24:26.766 --> 02:24:29.788]  The voice you're hearing is that of, well, me, Alex Jones.
[02:24:29.788 --> 02:24:31.069]  He's with us for the rest of the hour.
[02:24:31.069 --> 02:24:34.932]  Lou, I want to cover the waterfront with you and pick your brain.
[02:24:34.932 --> 02:24:39.855]  And I want to get into the Republican-Democratic field this year, Ron Paul, where all that's going.
[02:24:40.755 --> 02:24:52.039]  Paul Ryan, obviously Romney picked the wrong Paul, but I don't blame him for not picking Rand, because Rand's a lot better than Paul Ryan, so we know why that happened.
[02:24:52.039 --> 02:25:01.742]  But getting back to the issue of the world economy right now, from the perspective of an economist who heads up the Von Mies Institute, where are things going?
[02:25:01.742 --> 02:25:08.705]  And how can the very people that got us into this crisis get us out of it when their answer is give them more power and more corporate welfare?
[02:25:09.733 --> 02:25:15.855]  Alex, as you mentioned, I'm not an economist, although I think about economics and write about it and read about it.
[02:25:15.855 --> 02:25:20.536]  But I think we can, I think you know and your listeners know, there's serious trouble.
[02:25:20.536 --> 02:25:24.978]  They keep claiming they're patching up the euro in the eurozone.
[02:25:26.438 --> 02:25:28.119]  It's not actually happening.
[02:25:28.119 --> 02:25:30.040]  So maybe they're going to just continue.
[02:25:30.040 --> 02:25:41.966]  Maybe if the Germans let them, and I fear the Germans are going to let them, they're going to just print unlimited number of euros to buy the useless bonds of the countries that have issued them to the big banks.
[02:25:41.966 --> 02:25:47.769]  Because of course, as with all economic troubles these days, the big banks are in back of what's happening in Europe.
[02:25:47.769 --> 02:25:49.850]  Because they're not bailing out Greece.
[02:25:49.850 --> 02:25:52.011]  They're not bailing out Italy or Spain.
[02:25:52.011 --> 02:25:55.033]  They're bailing out the big banks that hold the bonds of these countries.
[02:25:55.646 --> 02:26:04.657]  And the so-called technocratic prime ministers that have been installed in Italy and Greece and probably in other countries too, and at the European Central Bank.
[02:26:04.657 --> 02:26:07.360]  These people typically come from Goldman Sachs.
[02:26:07.360 --> 02:26:11.104]  So these are the sorts of people who are in back of this.
[02:26:11.104 --> 02:26:15.830]  They want the people of Europe to be further impoverished so the banks can live it up.
[02:26:16.741 --> 02:26:18.481]  Same thing happens in our own country, of course.
[02:26:18.481 --> 02:26:21.562]  We live also in a bankocracy.
[02:26:21.562 --> 02:26:23.923]  So, they can keep printing up.
[02:26:23.923 --> 02:26:27.103]  Fed prints up all this, prints up trillions.
[02:26:27.103 --> 02:26:32.345]  But this does have an effect when, you know, it's made us all poorer already.
[02:26:32.345 --> 02:26:34.465]  How much poorer are we going to be?
[02:26:34.465 --> 02:26:42.527]  How much of a police state and a military state and a military junta, whatever the government is in Washington, I'm not exactly sure what it is.
[02:26:43.027 --> 02:26:46.948]  Certainly it's not anything like what was talked about by Thomas Jefferson.
[02:26:46.948 --> 02:26:48.908]  Sure, and Lou, let me just stop you to be specific.
[02:26:48.908 --> 02:26:54.189]  I knew that you're not technically an economist, but you head up a group that's made up of a bunch of economists.
[02:26:54.189 --> 02:26:58.990]  I mean, you wouldn't call Ron Paul an economist, but he writes books about it and studies it.
[02:26:58.990 --> 02:27:00.211]  He's a lay economist.
[02:27:00.211 --> 02:27:02.371]  It's like, I could go out and be a preacher.
[02:27:02.371 --> 02:27:03.671]  People call me the preacher.
[02:27:03.671 --> 02:27:07.732]  But I didn't go to seminary to be a preacher, though I did sit through a lot of Sunday school.
[02:27:07.732 --> 02:27:11.773]  My point is, you head up a group that is a consortium of economists, correct?
[02:27:12.304 --> 02:27:13.345]  Yes, of course, that's right.
[02:27:13.345 --> 02:27:17.909]  Okay, so my point is, I see you as a real economist.
[02:27:17.909 --> 02:27:22.953]  I don't have a degree in shooting, but with a good rifle I can shoot bullseye at 500 yards pretty easy.
[02:27:22.953 --> 02:27:25.635]  I'm not officially a sharpshooter, but I am.
[02:27:25.635 --> 02:27:33.062]  But just getting back to that, you are heavily into economics and you consult with a bunch of economists, so I wanted your pulse on that.
[02:27:34.144 --> 02:27:37.025]  Well, there's trouble.
[02:27:37.025 --> 02:27:41.466]  The pulse is a little bit harder to feel these days because of what the government is doing.
[02:27:41.466 --> 02:27:42.926]  We have, you know, in the U.S.
[02:27:42.926 --> 02:27:43.987]  government, and the U.S.
[02:27:43.987 --> 02:27:50.509]  government has got its clones in Britain and in Europe and so many other countries in the rest of the world, the U.S.
[02:27:50.509 --> 02:27:51.429]  government is the biggest
[02:27:52.109 --> 02:27:55.671]  Richest, most powerful government ever to exist in the history of humankind.
[02:27:55.671 --> 02:28:01.413]  There's never been anything like this before, so we are really in new territory.
[02:28:01.413 --> 02:28:03.894]  And new territory of disaster, I'm afraid.
[02:28:03.894 --> 02:28:16.739]  I noticed that Jim Rogers the other day thought that there was a collapse coming after the November elections because of all the money printing that's going on both in Europe and in Asia and in the United States, of course, too.
[02:28:16.739 --> 02:28:18.500]  So I don't know what the timing is.
[02:28:19.060 --> 02:28:23.683]  But they are undermining, they're like a bunch of termites.
[02:28:23.683 --> 02:28:26.305]  They're eating out the foundation of the house.
[02:28:26.305 --> 02:28:32.668]  When the house is going to collapse, I don't know, but if the termites aren't stopped, we can be sure the house is going to collapse.
[02:28:32.668 --> 02:28:37.171]  And then when the collapse does start to happen, as it's already started, they pose as saviors.
[02:28:37.171 --> 02:28:46.657]  So how do you stop them from turning us into a pure third world despotic system from the implosion that they've created?
[02:28:47.867 --> 02:28:50.629]  Well, you know, that's a great question.
[02:28:50.629 --> 02:28:53.371]  I think the first thing we have to do is educate ourselves.
[02:28:53.371 --> 02:28:55.013]  We all have to know some economics.
[02:28:55.013 --> 02:29:03.960]  I would recommend something like Henry Hazlitt's Economics in One Lesson, which was published in the late 1940s, but just as fresh today as it was then.
[02:29:03.960 --> 02:29:08.403]  And if you learn some economics, it enables you to see through the government lies.
[02:29:08.403 --> 02:29:12.166]  You can see through the smoke screen that they try to generate to cover their crimes.
[02:29:12.166 --> 02:29:14.088]  So you can understand.
[02:29:14.088 --> 02:29:16.530]  So everybody needs to understand some economics, first of all.
[02:29:16.850 --> 02:29:19.831]  Then we need to, you know, to resist.
[02:29:19.831 --> 02:29:21.671]  We need to withdraw our consent.
[02:29:21.671 --> 02:29:23.852]  We need to talk about what's going on.
[02:29:23.852 --> 02:29:25.772]  We need to listen to shows like yours.
[02:29:25.772 --> 02:29:29.933]  We need to read all the right books and mentally resist.
[02:29:29.933 --> 02:29:35.755]  Actually, mentally resisting is, you know, I would say, by the way, don't vote is one thing you can do.
[02:29:35.755 --> 02:29:37.535]  They're very anxious that we vote.
[02:29:37.535 --> 02:29:39.036]  They want that mandate from us.
[02:29:39.036 --> 02:29:41.356]  They don't care who you vote for.
[02:29:41.356 --> 02:29:43.657]  Ultimately, and this, of course, there are
[02:29:43.817 --> 02:29:45.258]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:45.258 --> 02:29:46.599]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.844 --> 02:30:06.825]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:06.825 --> 02:30:15.687]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.

[02:31:29.409 --> 02:31:30.930]  Easy to set up and use.
[02:31:30.930 --> 02:31:32.351]  Doesn't require electricity.
[02:31:32.351 --> 02:31:35.513]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[02:31:35.513 --> 02:31:38.915]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[02:31:38.915 --> 02:31:43.037]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[02:31:43.037 --> 02:31:45.779]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[02:31:45.779 --> 02:31:47.360]  It's what my family uses.

[02:31:59.206 --> 02:32:02.627]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:32:02.627 --> 02:32:08.209]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:32:08.209 --> 02:32:13.230]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:32:13.230 --> 02:32:18.272]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:32:18.812 --> 02:32:24.038]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:32:24.038 --> 02:32:31.146]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:32:31.146 --> 02:32:32.267]  And here's the best part.
[02:32:32.267 --> 02:32:38.634]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:32:38.954 --> 02:32:42.135]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:32:42.135 --> 02:32:44.356]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[02:32:45.696 --> 02:32:48.937]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:32:48.937 --> 02:32:50.657]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:33:11.895 --> 02:33:13.104]  Yeah.

[02:33:47.377 --> 02:33:48.798]  They've been around for more than 15 years.
[02:33:50.339 --> 02:33:53.484]  And it's all available discounted at InfoWarsTeam.com.
[02:33:53.484 --> 02:34:01.555]  You can go to InfoWars.com and see a new information video we put out showing the side-by-side comparisons of Aaron Dyches, myself.
[02:34:02.788 --> 02:34:10.814]  And others, and the incredible weight loss and health benefits of the products at Infowarsteam.com.
[02:34:10.814 --> 02:34:19.660]  Deficiency of vitamins and minerals causes obesity because it makes you want to then eat more and more because you're eating empty calories.
[02:34:19.660 --> 02:34:22.882]  And lo and behold, government won't tell anybody this.
[02:34:22.882 --> 02:34:29.147]  And government-controlled big medicine doesn't want to tell you this because, well, it's a rigged system.
[02:34:29.747 --> 02:34:35.736]  So check out that new video up at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:34:35.736 --> 02:34:37.558]  Very powerful video.
[02:34:37.558 --> 02:34:40.843]  And continuing, there's a lot of other news up there on the site.
[02:34:40.843 --> 02:34:42.805]  FAA documents how drones
[02:34:44.781 --> 02:34:47.203]  Over U.S.-Po's huge security risk.
[02:35:03.277 --> 02:35:08.342]  First off, what is this obsession with supersonic cruise missiles?
[02:35:08.342 --> 02:35:10.444]  I guess it's about military domination.
[02:35:10.444 --> 02:35:20.714]  But this 1.4 billion rounds of ammo against us, the FAA saying, yeah, 30,000 drones and they're starting to arm them.
[02:35:20.714 --> 02:35:27.920]  Is this all part of government wanting big giant marble buildings to make us feel small and drones and letting us know we're being watched?
[02:35:28.641 --> 02:35:33.125]  Face scanning cameras and TSA abusing us.
[02:35:33.125 --> 02:35:34.286]  What is all that about?
[02:35:34.286 --> 02:35:38.950]  Just the simple act of domination because they seem to think it's scaring people.
[02:35:38.950 --> 02:35:40.211]  I don't see that happening.
[02:35:40.211 --> 02:35:46.436]  I see it upsetting people and that's why they're getting politically involved, exposing the system.
[02:35:46.436 --> 02:35:49.079]  That's why they're out buying guns at record numbers.
[02:35:49.079 --> 02:35:53.803]  What would you say the mood of the country is right now and why is government obsessed with all these armaments?
[02:35:54.448 --> 02:35:56.391]  Well, I think it's true that people are getting upset.
[02:35:56.391 --> 02:35:58.234]  They ought to be upset.
[02:35:58.234 --> 02:36:05.025]  Even Hitler and Stalin didn't make, you know, be able to feel up people's children and wives and so forth in the airport.
[02:36:05.025 --> 02:36:08.811]  I mean, this is, most people just accept this, or at least they go along with it.
[02:36:11.452 --> 02:36:13.134]  But I think there is increasing resistance.
[02:36:13.134 --> 02:36:14.356]  People are angry.
[02:36:14.356 --> 02:36:15.697]  They should be angry.
[02:36:15.697 --> 02:36:24.867]  And as you say, of course, people are buying, every time there's one of these incidents, like in the Batman shooting or whatever, there's vast increases in gun sales.
[02:36:24.867 --> 02:36:26.088]  People want to be armed.
[02:36:26.088 --> 02:36:28.231]  They want to have a gun in their home, and of course they should.
[02:36:28.231 --> 02:36:29.452]  They should be armed.
[02:36:30.813 --> 02:36:34.436]  It's a great thing to have law-abiding, good people armed.
[02:36:34.436 --> 02:36:37.138]  And as we know, it cuts down crime rates, private crime.
[02:36:37.138 --> 02:36:43.003]  Doesn't much affect government crime, of course, but it does cut down private crime, which is a wonderful benefit.
[02:36:43.003 --> 02:36:51.229]  But yeah, the government wants us all to... You only have to go to... I don't recommend going to Washington, but if you do go to Washington, D.C., take a look at the buildings.
[02:36:51.229 --> 02:36:52.090]  They absolutely are
[02:36:52.090 --> 02:36:59.493]  We're all built to make you feel small, and make you impressed in all the power and glory of the government.
[02:36:59.493 --> 02:37:14.140]  So all this stuff has to, because it also has to do with fearing the people, but they want to make us scared of them, they want to make us scared of phony foreign enemies, and they want to make us obey.
[02:37:14.140 --> 02:37:20.883]  They want us to be rubbed and to be pushed down, to make all the peons
[02:37:21.463 --> 02:37:25.206]  Well, sure, there's so many progressives who are well-meaning people, but they never really run a business.
[02:37:25.206 --> 02:37:28.229]  Talking to them, they always come out of academia, come out of government, they're disconnected
[02:37:44.642 --> 02:37:53.412]  from the real world and how stuff really works and they always have these grand utopian views but all they ever deliver is hell on earth.
[02:37:53.412 --> 02:37:57.496]  History shows that and we repeat it over and over again.
[02:37:57.496 --> 02:38:03.603]  Let me get into this subject and then into election 2012 and the point you're chomping at the bit to cover Paul Ryan and the rest of it.
[02:38:04.673 --> 02:38:06.575]  And that's false flag staged events.
[02:38:06.575 --> 02:38:14.721]  I know everything isn't staged, but a lot of things have been staged, like Gulf of Tonkin, Operation Ajax, Gladio, Northwoods, the list goes on and on.
[02:38:14.721 --> 02:38:17.663]  Or at least, in many cases, they use crises.
[02:38:17.663 --> 02:38:24.188]  They don't want those to go to waste, as the White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel said, former Chief of Staff, now Mayor of Chicago.
[02:38:24.188 --> 02:38:30.994]  But now we see the spectacle of al-Qaeda flags over Libya, al-Qaeda flags over rebel-herald areas of Syria.
[02:38:31.474 --> 02:38:36.336]  We see the CFR fellow writing for them last week saying, we need Al Qaeda.
[02:38:36.336 --> 02:38:37.116]  That's a quote.
[02:38:37.116 --> 02:38:38.617]  They're heroes.
[02:38:38.617 --> 02:38:40.398]  They're doing a great job.
[02:38:40.398 --> 02:38:47.701]  So the TSA needs to abuse my family and take them into a private rape room if I want to fly.
[02:38:47.701 --> 02:38:55.424]  But Al Qaeda is good in Libya and Syria and NATO's working with the criminals out of Saudi Arabia.
[02:38:55.424 --> 02:38:58.866]  And then on top of that, I had Larry Pratt on a few weeks ago and he said, look,
[02:38:59.666 --> 02:39:13.473]  If the Obama criminals would stage Fast and Furious, that's killed thousands, why wouldn't they stage the Batman shooting when you've got reports of multiple gunmen, multiple gas masks, the cover-ups, the government psychiatrists?
[02:39:13.473 --> 02:39:15.754]  I mean, we know they do stuff like this.
[02:39:15.754 --> 02:39:22.698]  So what do you say about false flag terror and our so-called government publicly running Al Qaeda?
[02:39:22.698 --> 02:39:26.700]  Well, you know, as you know, all governments, especially police states,
[02:39:27.781 --> 02:39:29.722]  Employees are provocateurs.
[02:39:29.722 --> 02:39:42.670]  They cause crimes, they cause terrorist incidents in order to get the public all hepped up and also maybe to expose people that they fear themselves.
[02:39:42.670 --> 02:39:43.750]  Who knows about that?
[02:39:43.750 --> 02:39:49.814]  But their main thing is to control their own public, their own cash cows, their own taxpayers.
[02:39:49.814 --> 02:39:53.056]  That's the people they are really concerned about controlling.
[02:39:53.056 --> 02:39:54.417]  So yeah, of course they run
[02:39:56.648 --> 02:39:57.229]  Sometimes, no.
[02:39:57.229 --> 02:40:01.231]  Whether things are false flags or not, obviously we can't tell what's coming.
[02:40:01.231 --> 02:40:05.474]  But is this government or any big government capable of false flag operations?
[02:40:05.474 --> 02:40:07.335]  Of course.
[02:40:07.335 --> 02:40:15.660]  If they don't do something evil, it's either because they haven't thought about it or because they think it's not prudent for themselves at the time.
[02:40:15.660 --> 02:40:18.722]  They never have the reaction, oh gosh, we can't do that, it's wrong.
[02:40:19.565 --> 02:40:29.401]  That never passes the mind of anybody in Washington, with the exception of... I hate to think of Ron Paul as being part of Washington, but obviously Ron Paul and a handful of other guys are...
[02:40:32.488 --> 02:40:32.749]  Bingo!
[02:40:32.749 --> 02:40:36.712]  That actually came out in a few papers, as you know, because you're so informed, that they were shipping drugs back.
[02:40:36.712 --> 02:40:38.854]  It wasn't just guns in, it was basically an Iran-Contra Part 2.
[02:40:54.657 --> 02:41:00.599]  Forced the Mexicans, who of course are in effect a colony of the U.S., forced them to have a drug war down there.
[02:41:00.599 --> 02:41:04.220]  There have been more than 50,000 people killed.
[02:41:04.220 --> 02:41:07.201]  Horrendous damage to Mexican society.
[02:41:07.201 --> 02:41:16.523]  And it's all, of course, being either staged or run or at least cooperated with by the DEA and the CIA.
[02:41:16.523 --> 02:41:21.685]  Why doesn't the Mexican kleptocracy kick out the big banks that run them?
[02:41:23.137 --> 02:41:25.242]  Well, because they're all making money, they're also afraid, right?
[02:41:25.242 --> 02:41:27.007]  They're afraid of being killed.
[02:41:27.007 --> 02:41:27.989]  Because certainly the U.S.
[02:41:27.989 --> 02:41:30.215]  government doesn't hesitate to assassinate people.
[02:41:30.215 --> 02:41:31.578]  We're now having that openly talked about.
[02:41:35.862 --> 02:41:36.482]  No, I don't think so.
[02:41:56.834 --> 02:41:57.034]  I think?
[02:42:18.422 --> 02:42:23.303]  You know, don't commit the flag and the Pledge of Allegiance and all that stuff.
[02:42:23.303 --> 02:42:24.384]  These are bad people.
[02:42:24.384 --> 02:42:26.164]  The government, they're bad people.
[02:42:26.164 --> 02:42:27.744]  Well, they're also maniacs.
[02:42:27.744 --> 02:42:40.568]  I mean, I couldn't imagine putting my employees' stuff in the bathroom over and over again and then calling an employee up and saying, get in here and give me sexual favors right now.
[02:42:42.797 --> 02:42:48.661]  Only hiring people that were my sexual persuasion, as we now see coming out in these lawsuits.
[02:42:48.661 --> 02:42:51.523]  It just really shows a disconnect.
[02:42:51.523 --> 02:42:54.865]  But we see this in every culture and every history with the power mad.
[02:42:54.865 --> 02:42:57.266]  Look at Caligula marrying his horse.
[02:42:57.266 --> 02:42:59.167]  What do you make of the big scandal with Big Sis?
[02:43:00.208 --> 02:43:02.970]  Well, of course, this is a great peek into the government.
[02:43:02.970 --> 02:43:06.112]  And there are plenty, by the way, of decent people in the government.
[02:43:06.112 --> 02:43:07.953]  They just don't rise to the top.
[02:43:07.953 --> 02:43:17.559]  The people who rise to the top, whether it's the DHS or whatever, you know, they're not concerned with security or the rest of the lies they tell.
[02:43:17.559 --> 02:43:20.661]  They're concerned with sex, power, and money.
[02:43:20.661 --> 02:43:22.442]  So those are the three things that motivate
[02:43:23.106 --> 02:43:27.429]  The power elite and the people in the government, the people at the top of the government.
[02:43:27.429 --> 02:43:30.711]  So, this is not just DHS, this is the whole government.
[02:43:30.711 --> 02:43:38.897]  This stuff happens in the Pentagon, it happens in the CIA, it happens at the FAA, the whole alphabet from hell.
[02:43:38.897 --> 02:43:39.817]  All these are like this.
[02:43:39.817 --> 02:43:42.759]  So how wonderful we're having this pointed out about the DHS.
[02:43:42.759 --> 02:43:43.280]  Maybe it will
[02:43:43.980 --> 02:43:48.502]  Perhaps the scales fall from people's eyes about the nature of this thing.
[02:43:48.502 --> 02:43:52.104]  And it's great to look up, by the way, the headquarters of DHS.
[02:43:52.104 --> 02:43:54.225]  It looks like something out of Mordor.
[02:43:54.225 --> 02:43:55.146]  And it's the former St.
[02:43:55.146 --> 02:43:58.728]  Elizabeth's Mental Hospital, where political prisoners have been held.
[02:43:58.728 --> 02:44:00.729]  And they converted it into their headquarters.
[02:44:00.729 --> 02:44:01.789]  It's very scary.
[02:44:01.789 --> 02:44:03.450]  And it's, of course, intended to be scary.
[02:44:03.450 --> 02:44:11.154]  Like, whether the way they paint the cop cars these days, the way they dress the cops, everything is intended to scare you.
[02:44:12.340 --> 02:44:26.487]  When I'm thinking of cops in dress, there was a great period at one time in Menlo Park, California, where a bunch of liberals got in power, and they had the cops dressed in gray slacks, blue blazers with a city patch on their pocket.
[02:44:26.487 --> 02:44:29.528]  The whole nature of cop-civilian interaction changed.
[02:44:29.992 --> 02:44:35.795]  All of a sudden they weren't marching around like an occupying force, and it was a great development.
[02:44:35.795 --> 02:44:38.136]  The cop union was very much against it.
[02:44:38.136 --> 02:44:44.858]  Conservatives got back in, and they succeeded in repealing this and putting everybody back into military-like uniforms.
[02:44:44.858 --> 02:44:50.821]  Well, there's one problem, too, when they standardize it and make it a military uniform, and now the cops are calling us civilians.
[02:44:50.821 --> 02:44:52.422]  They're civilians, too.
[02:44:52.422 --> 02:44:53.842]  You don't want them to be military.
[02:44:53.842 --> 02:44:55.903]  Military's an occupying army.
[02:44:55.903 --> 02:44:56.383]  This is all 101.
[02:44:58.224 --> 02:45:00.065]  Lou Rockwell, let's look at this election.
[02:45:00.065 --> 02:45:11.413]  So many people know that Mitt Romney was for gun bans, and abortion, and open borders, and globalism, and carbon taxes, and banker bailouts.
[02:45:11.413 --> 02:45:14.114]  Paul Ryan, banker bailouts, no child left behind.
[02:45:14.114 --> 02:45:17.717]  I mean, the list literally goes on and on, but he was held up
[02:45:18.317 --> 02:45:28.768]  As a conservative savior by Rush Limbaugh for his plan to cut welfare to the general, you know, poor people, which is fine with me because it just makes them dependent and screws up the economy.
[02:45:28.768 --> 02:45:31.932]  But what about cutting military spending like Ron Paul has said?
[02:45:31.932 --> 02:45:35.496]  And people are like, oh, no, you've got to just worship.
[02:45:35.996 --> 02:45:42.743]  Paul Ryan, well I was told I need to worship Obama and he was going to fix things and now we're hearing about Ryan mania.
[02:45:42.743 --> 02:45:44.665]  I mean is there no end to this?
[02:45:44.665 --> 02:45:49.190]  Are mainline conservatives as stupid as Obama supporters?
[02:45:49.190 --> 02:45:50.812]  Sure they're stupid.
[02:45:50.812 --> 02:45:52.654]  A lot of them are just wrong too.
[02:45:52.654 --> 02:45:55.156]  They believe they worship the military.
[02:45:55.156 --> 02:45:56.658]  They worship the police.
[02:45:56.658 --> 02:45:57.739]  They worship the national security.
[02:46:01.053 --> 02:46:11.738]  So, you know, if we think of the Tea Party, there's a bunch of them who are Ron Paulians, but there's also a bunch of them who are, you know, Sarah Palinites, Rush Limbaughites, and so forth, who believe in the whole regime.
[02:46:11.738 --> 02:46:21.422]  And so they applaud the wars, they applaud the killing, they love that stuff, and they think it'll never happen because they think they'll never be arrested, they'll never be tortured, they'll never be tasered.
[02:46:21.422 --> 02:46:22.002]  Good luck to them.
[02:46:24.173 --> 02:46:29.838]  You know, they are stupid or they're wrong.
[02:46:29.838 --> 02:46:31.159]  They're ill-educated.
[02:46:31.159 --> 02:46:33.160]  They don't understand the nature of politics.
[02:46:33.160 --> 02:46:34.161]  They don't understand history.
[02:46:34.161 --> 02:46:36.983]  They don't understand economics.
[02:46:36.983 --> 02:46:39.465]  And they also just buy into rhetoric.
[02:46:39.465 --> 02:46:40.926]  How stupid are people?
[02:46:40.926 --> 02:46:43.789]  I think of this when there's always the rhetoric for a new war.
[02:46:45.049 --> 02:46:51.191]  And of course, we're running a war against Syria right now, allied with Al-Qaeda, which of course was created by the U.S.
[02:46:51.191 --> 02:46:53.912]  government to go up against the Russians in Afghanistan.
[02:46:53.912 --> 02:46:54.892]  It's when the U.S.
[02:46:54.892 --> 02:46:57.293]  employed Osama bin Laden and all those guys.
[02:46:57.293 --> 02:46:59.393]  So they're bad, they're good, they're bad, they're good.
[02:46:59.393 --> 02:47:03.755]  You know, this is the old switcheroo to keep everybody on balance.
[02:47:03.755 --> 02:47:04.635]  But Paul Ryan,
[02:47:05.439 --> 02:47:07.379]  Anybody, all you have to do is look at his record.
[02:47:07.379 --> 02:47:10.620]  He voted for every rotten thing that's ever gone through the Congress.
[02:47:10.620 --> 02:47:15.681]  If the Republicans were supporting, and of course the Republicans do support all the rotten stuff.
[02:47:15.681 --> 02:47:29.804]  Whether it's the bank bailouts, he said no child left behind, Medicare Part D, the permanency of the Patriot Act, the NDAA, SOMA, CISPA, I mean all these horrendous internet control laws and so forth.
[02:47:29.804 --> 02:47:35.025]  This guy is for the expansion of the DHS, he's for more war, he's for bigger and bigger
[02:47:35.165 --> 02:47:35.605]  I don't know.
[02:48:00.443 --> 02:48:05.565]  So we have right fascism and left fascism with Obama, right fascism, that's our choice.
[02:48:05.565 --> 02:48:08.246]  And we have another fascist in Paul Ryan.
[02:48:08.246 --> 02:48:20.050]  So the fact that he uses tricky rhetoric, that he uses libertarian or Ayn Randian rhetoric to disguise his devotion to the total central state and the global empire, well it's just another political trick.
[02:48:20.550 --> 02:48:27.213]  So I'd urge people, if anybody's thinking this is a good guy, or because they're portraying him as Ron Paul.
[02:48:27.213 --> 02:48:30.215]  There is only one Ron Paul, and this is of course the phony Ron Paul.
[02:48:30.215 --> 02:48:34.357]  This is the devil dressed up as Ron Paul.
[02:48:34.357 --> 02:48:36.278]  This guy is a very bad guy.
[02:48:36.278 --> 02:48:37.919]  He's a total neocon.
[02:48:37.919 --> 02:48:40.920]  He's controlled by all the bad forces.
[02:48:40.920 --> 02:48:45.302]  And his wife, by the way, also was a lobbyist for Big Pharma before she married him.
[02:48:45.302 --> 02:48:46.683]  So this is a connected family.
[02:48:47.363 --> 02:48:48.584]  And they've done very well.
[02:48:48.584 --> 02:49:00.609]  It recently came out that when he was briefed by Bernanke, right at the beginning of the banking crisis, he sold his stocks that he knew were going to go down.
[02:49:00.609 --> 02:49:03.290]  Wachovia and Citibank in particular.
[02:49:03.290 --> 02:49:07.132]  And he bought a lot of stock in Goldman Sachs, which he'd been told was going to go up.
[02:49:07.132 --> 02:49:10.293]  So of course this is the way these guys get rich.
[02:49:10.293 --> 02:49:11.654]  He's a very powerful guy.
[02:49:11.654 --> 02:49:13.835]  He's a complete phony.
[02:49:14.415 --> 02:49:17.937]  He's a, he's just, he's a very bad guy.
[02:49:17.937 --> 02:49:19.497]  Who else would Romney pick?
[02:49:19.497 --> 02:49:21.838]  Romney, Romney is a very bad guy.
[02:49:21.838 --> 02:49:23.379]  Well yeah, talk about phony.
[02:49:23.379 --> 02:49:25.820]  For torture, concentration camps, everything.
[02:49:25.820 --> 02:49:27.141]  These are very bad men.
[02:49:27.141 --> 02:49:30.442]  Well no, Romney will do... Besides Biden and Obama.
[02:49:30.442 --> 02:49:31.142]  Sure, sure.
[02:49:31.142 --> 02:49:41.887]  I mean, Romney will do stuff like call on his neighbors that are smoking pot, call the police, but then come in and take over companies and strip them and destroy them and then prance around all day.
[02:49:41.887 --> 02:49:43.248]  I've noticed really evil people
[02:49:44.158 --> 02:49:47.641]  We'll have this act that they're Mr. Goody Two-Shoes.
[02:49:47.641 --> 02:49:49.582]  I mean, look at the whole Sandusky thing.
[02:49:49.582 --> 02:49:50.383]  Look at that.
[02:49:50.383 --> 02:49:53.826]  Look at how these universities basically become little governments.
[02:49:53.826 --> 02:49:57.949]  And then now the head of Penn State has been sent off to work at Homeland Security.
[02:49:57.949 --> 02:50:04.034]  So now if you cover up for pedophile rings, you don't go to jail, you go to Homeland Security.
[02:50:04.034 --> 02:50:05.115]  Well, of course, it was a cover-up.
[02:50:05.115 --> 02:50:07.837]  That's why Louis Freeh was sent in to cover it up.
[02:50:09.385 --> 02:50:17.795]  Um, the governor of Pennsylvania, the Republican governor of Pennsylvania, when he was attorney, he was attorney general when a lot of this stuff was first being talked about.
[02:50:18.402 --> 02:50:18.682]  Why didn't
[02:50:41.522 --> 02:50:43.663]  No, exactly.
[02:50:43.663 --> 02:50:47.546]  It's even coming out in major papers now that it's what we thought it was.
[02:50:47.546 --> 02:50:51.289]  A pedophile ring pimping kids out to these degenerates.
[02:50:51.289 --> 02:50:56.953]  I want to look at Obama himself, the warmonger, when we come back with Lew Rockwell of LewRockwell.com.
[02:50:56.953 --> 02:50:58.695]  I'm Alex Jones of InfoWars.com.
[02:51:01.530 --> 02:51:03.090]  Don't throw away leftovers.
[02:51:03.090 --> 02:51:09.192]  Instead, throw all your leftovers, vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts, and more into the Bokashi!
[02:51:09.192 --> 02:51:17.373]  If you love to garden and compost, but don't like the hassle of turning a compost bin or the smell, then check out the E-M Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System from Terragonics.

[02:54:35.390 --> 02:54:37.392]  More cowbell!
[02:54:37.392 --> 02:54:39.775]  That's a Saturday Night Live joke if you just joined us.
[02:54:39.775 --> 02:54:42.538]  Alright, final segment with Lou Rockwell.
[02:54:44.525 --> 02:54:48.987]  Lou, you know, we've talked about the Republicans, but what about Obama?
[02:54:48.987 --> 02:54:54.671]  I mean, where is the so-called left that are bad on a lot of things, but at least for anti-war torture?
[02:54:54.671 --> 02:55:00.374]  Now they're kind of like, hey, torture people, drones, murder, death, Al Qaeda, kill everybody.
[02:55:00.374 --> 02:55:01.414]  Al Qaeda's good.
[02:55:01.414 --> 02:55:02.175]  We love war.
[02:55:02.175 --> 02:55:02.955]  It's our president.
[02:55:02.955 --> 02:55:03.936]  He's tough.
[02:55:03.936 --> 02:55:08.278]  And I see Democratic leaders bragging, saying, see, we're warmongers, we're tough.
[02:55:08.278 --> 02:55:13.581]  What is it about decadent, affected people that they think murder and death is cool and powerful?
[02:55:14.201 --> 02:55:17.488]  Well, first of all, of course, political parties are about lying.
[02:55:17.488 --> 02:55:21.357]  The government is about lying, and the political parties that are part of the government are
[02:55:23.729 --> 02:55:24.510]  We're good to go.
[02:55:53.587 --> 02:55:56.808]  It's why, for example, it's impossible to take over a political party from the outside.
[02:55:56.808 --> 02:55:59.769]  You know, take over the Department of Justice while you're at it.
[02:55:59.769 --> 02:56:01.870]  You can't do it.
[02:56:01.870 --> 02:56:06.011]  You can just refuse to be part of it, but you can't actually take them over.
[02:56:06.011 --> 02:56:14.554]  And like cancer, they're programmed to totally take over, so how long until they fully implode everything and start trying to use their 1.4 billion bullets on us?
[02:56:15.424 --> 02:56:23.871]  Well, I think that, again, I started to say this before, but the government is so big that it's out of control, even internally.
[02:56:23.871 --> 02:56:34.080]  The problems of bureaucracy, Levi von Mises wrote about this in his great little book on bureaucracy many years ago, but the problems of bureaucracy, and there's never been a bureaucracy like the U.S.
[02:56:34.080 --> 02:56:40.045]  government, so they're becoming more and more trouble, but more and more troubled, too.
[02:56:40.045 --> 02:56:42.787]  I always think of it like a blind, vicious
[02:56:43.788 --> 02:56:48.072]  So if you happen to get in their jaws or you're stepped on or whatever, you're dead.
[02:56:48.072 --> 02:56:49.833]  But you don't have to be.
[02:57:03.185 --> 02:57:03.646]  That's right.
[02:57:03.646 --> 02:57:06.407]  Governments have come down in the past.
[02:57:06.407 --> 02:57:13.530]  As our government becomes bankrupt, the government is bankrupt, and is trying to bankrupt us too, of course, at the same time.
[02:57:13.530 --> 02:57:19.013]  And as its own troops, and this happens when empires start to come down, its own troops don't obey it.
[02:57:19.013 --> 02:57:26.117]  So, I'd like to think that if American troops were ordered to shoot American citizens, they would actually refuse to do it.
[02:57:26.117 --> 02:57:28.838]  I'm going to keep my fingers crossed if that's the case.
[02:57:30.725 --> 02:57:31.245]  That's good!
[02:57:31.245 --> 02:57:31.546]  That's good!
[02:57:49.702 --> 02:57:51.044]  That's a funny image.
[02:57:51.044 --> 02:57:54.547]  Casper milk toast, albeit with vampire teeth.
[02:57:54.547 --> 02:57:55.588]  No, no, I agree with you.
[02:57:55.588 --> 02:57:58.031]  But they're dangerous because they're cornered rats.
[02:57:58.031 --> 02:58:00.033]  But we actually have the initiative.
[02:58:00.033 --> 02:58:00.674]  They know that.
[02:58:00.674 --> 02:58:03.457]  And their own bureaucracy is starting to fall apart.
[02:58:03.457 --> 02:58:05.479]  And a lot of military and police are waking up.
[02:58:05.479 --> 02:58:11.386]  It may end up being... If they call for martial law, it might be their Waterloo, like Romania with Ceausescu.
[02:58:12.233 --> 02:58:13.434]  Well, it could be.
[02:58:13.434 --> 02:58:16.296]  And I think they are very worried about us.
[02:58:16.296 --> 02:58:18.198]  They're worried about their own people.
[02:58:18.198 --> 02:58:19.318]  And they should be worried.
[02:58:19.318 --> 02:58:25.183]  So it's an entirely illegitimate operation that lives off lies and theft and killing and so forth.
[02:58:25.183 --> 02:58:27.765]  And governments have come down.
[02:58:27.765 --> 02:58:29.666]  It is in danger of imploding.
[02:58:29.666 --> 02:58:32.248]  I should say in danger from their standpoint of imploding.
[02:58:32.248 --> 02:58:33.929]  It would be a great day for us, of course.
[02:58:33.929 --> 02:58:34.430]  Exactly.
[02:58:34.430 --> 02:58:35.991]  Lew Rockwell, thank you so much.
[02:58:35.991 --> 02:58:38.853]  Kasper Miltos, thank you, with vampire teeth.
[02:58:38.853 --> 02:58:39.554]  That's Obama.
[02:58:42.267 --> 02:58:43.210]  Nosferatu.
[02:58:43.210 --> 02:58:45.639]  We'll see you tonight at 7 o'clock, folks.
