[00:00:04.542 --> 00:00:05.042]  Welcome back.
[00:00:05.603 --> 00:00:09.026]  Our next story ties in pretty well with our guest that follows it.
[00:00:09.786 --> 00:00:13.810]  Big Brother is encroaching farther and farther on your private property.
[00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.994]  An amazing article today, the court has okayed warrantless use of hidden surveillance cameras.
[00:00:19.774 --> 00:00:27.721]  This is a case where the DEA installed multiple covert digital surveillance cameras on private property in order to spy and without getting a warrant.
[00:00:28.701 --> 00:00:28.901]  U.S.
[00:00:28.941 --> 00:00:39.244]  District Judge William Griesbach ruled that warrants aren't necessary because it upheld, and listen to this, the use of technology as a substitute for ordinary police surveillance.
[00:00:40.084 --> 00:00:43.705]  Now, technology is not a substitute for police surveillance.
[00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:50.547]  Just because we're using a different technology doesn't mean that we give up our rights to be searched, and surveillance is a search.
[00:00:51.327 --> 00:00:56.208]  But the Supreme Court has already rejected in January warrantless GPS tracking
[00:00:57.115 --> 00:01:00.258]  They rejected prior to that warrantless thermal imaging.
[00:01:00.318 --> 00:01:01.799]  They have coming up before them.
[00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.465]  They've yet not yet determined whether warrantless cell phone tracking is going to be allowed.
[00:01:08.565 --> 00:01:10.487]  So they will be also reviewing this case.
[00:01:10.527 --> 00:01:11.868]  I'm sure it will go to the Supreme Court.
[00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:22.638]  In this particular case there were no trespassing signs that were posted throughout the heavily wooded 22-acre property and it also had a heavy gate.
[00:01:23.931 --> 00:01:30.092]  Now, the legal fiction of all this is based on a 1984 Supreme Court ruling called Oliver vs. United States.
[00:01:30.713 --> 00:01:37.374]  And it found, amazingly, that open fields could be searched without warrants because they're not covered by the Fourth Amendment.
[00:01:38.134 --> 00:01:42.715]  Well, you might want to look at your copy of the Fourth Amendment because mine doesn't have any exceptions for open fields.
[00:01:43.375 --> 00:01:46.836]  Now, this is all based on a legal fiction called curtilage.
[00:01:47.456 --> 00:01:50.457]  Now, that's a term for the area that immediately surrounds your home.
[00:01:51.334 --> 00:01:54.416]  But what we're seeing here is a gradual encroachment.
[00:01:54.657 --> 00:02:06.726]  First, they say that if they don't need a warrant to put surveillance cameras or to spy on you on the outer edges of your property, they only need it to go under the curtilage or if they're going to go inside of your house.
[00:02:07.446 --> 00:02:10.128]  And that's just a creeping encroachment on your rights.
[00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:15.653]  It's the same sort of thing as if your neighbor were to put their fence on your property and leave it there for a while.
[00:02:15.773 --> 00:02:20.957]  If we don't say something about these encroachments, then we basically lose our rights.
[00:02:21.718 --> 00:02:25.665]  And that's exactly what's going on with Wade Hicks' case.
[00:02:25.725 --> 00:02:27.809]  Now, Wade Hicks, if you remember, we've covered him twice.
[00:02:28.863 --> 00:02:33.727]  On the nightly news, and he was on radio news earlier today with Alex Jones.
[00:02:34.167 --> 00:02:49.019]  Wade is the fellow who was put on a no-fly list without being notified, and midway through his journey to see his wife, who's in the military in Japan, he was taken off the plane in Hawaii and told that he couldn't fly.
[00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:56.845]  So he was basically stranded in Hawaii, and he was stranded there from a Sunday to a Thursday until that restriction was lifted.
[00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.190]  And Wade is on his way home now.
[00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.971]  He finally was able to get back home.
[00:03:01.712 --> 00:03:09.336]  And he's on his way home, and he's a longtime listener, and he was kind enough to swing by Austin on his way home to Mississippi from California.
[00:03:10.076 --> 00:03:14.799]  And I had him in the studio earlier with Alex Jones, and we've got him in the studio right now.
[00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.301]  Well, Wade, thank you for coming in and seeing us here at the station.
[00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:24.164]  You're on your way home, and we really appreciate you taking the time to come by and tell people more about your story.
[00:03:25.245 --> 00:03:26.566]  You know, it's the sort of thing where
[00:03:27.344 --> 00:03:35.553]  A lot of people's instinct would just be to kind of hunker down and try to keep a low profile and just hope that this goes away, but you kind of met it head on and that's a good thing to do.
[00:03:35.874 --> 00:03:36.915]  Well, that's the thing.
[00:03:37.536 --> 00:03:40.139]  If you're in that type of situation, you have to keep your head screwed on straight.
[00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:41.120]  Don't get emotional and just...
[00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.452]  Do whatever you know or what you think is the best thing to do.
[00:03:46.053 --> 00:03:52.841]  And for me, it was going to the media, going to my friends, because those were really the only people that were going to be able to help me.
[00:03:53.702 --> 00:03:55.504]  The government wasn't going to do anything to help me.
[00:03:55.544 --> 00:03:59.068]  They were just doing their whole bureaucratic nightmare stuff.
[00:04:00.014 --> 00:04:04.557]  So I could have been there three months had I not been as proactive as I was trying to get this story out.
[00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:12.241]  That's right, and they still to this day have not given you any information as to why you were put on the list or what your current status is, whether you're on the list or whether you're off of the list.
[00:04:12.401 --> 00:04:24.969]  No, they've never, I've asked Ford in writing, they've never given me anything in writing to say that I was on the list, they never gave me anything that says I was off the list, and it completely throws everything we know about the Constitution in due process out the window.
[00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:27.260]  Yeah, it's a very dangerous situation.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.141]  Not just for you, but for everybody.
[00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:35.446]  Because when the government can secretly accuse somebody of something, you still have no idea what they thought was wrong.
[00:04:36.046 --> 00:04:36.847]  And they won't tell you.
[00:04:36.867 --> 00:04:42.831]  When they can secretly accuse you, and then secretly impose penalties on you, they can do that to anybody.
[00:04:43.291 --> 00:04:44.091]  Well, absolutely.
[00:04:44.432 --> 00:04:55.119]  And what's really scary is there's a lot of members of the military that their spouses do use military aircraft to fly space available when they're on deployment to go meet their loved ones that are deployed.
[00:04:56.048 --> 00:04:57.309]  Um, and that's what I was doing.
[00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:01.453]  I was going, using a travel authorization from the military to go see my wife.
[00:05:02.414 --> 00:05:10.161]  And, you know, if I could be stopped mid-flight, put on a no-fly list, and detained in Hawaii basically indefinitely until they decided to let me go...
[00:05:11.095 --> 00:05:14.818]  This could happen to any military member's spouse or children even.
[00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:31.351]  And that's something that's extremely alarming, that they're going after not only people that are outspoken like myself, but going after military spouses and military members directly, basically saying, oh well, you know, you're questionable, so you can't fly because we said so.
[00:05:31.371 --> 00:05:32.192]  Right, right.
[00:05:32.927 --> 00:05:34.308]  So where do you go from here?
[00:05:34.408 --> 00:05:35.309]  What are your plans?
[00:05:35.329 --> 00:05:41.353]  Because you said you're not going to let this just go and let it drop since you're able to move now, presumably.
[00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:42.174]  Well, I can't.
[00:05:42.314 --> 00:05:46.497]  I mean, our divorce states if your enemy is retreating, attack them.
[00:05:47.177 --> 00:05:51.480]  And of course, I mean that, of course, in all legal remedies, attack.
[00:05:53.181 --> 00:06:00.646]  But basically what I'm going to do is I'm going to engage my senators and my congressmen in Mississippi and I'm going to demand that they
[00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:13.961]  Have some dialogue on this on the floor of the House, on the floor of the Senate, to revamp this entire no-fly program because obviously the system is broken and it needs to be fixed and Congress has the power and the authority to fix this complete thing.
[00:06:14.876 --> 00:06:27.989]  It's shameful when you go to an airport that the TSA that has no sworn oath to defend the Constitution or anything, they're no different than mall security guards except they get to put your hands down your pants when the mall security guards don't.
[00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:28.710]  Right, right.
[00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.975]  And your case takes it to another level because we're back to something like the Spanish Inquisition where they say
[00:06:34.873 --> 00:06:38.415]  We can't tell you what's going on with this because that would violate national security.
[00:06:38.435 --> 00:06:40.336]  Well, they can make that claim about anything, right?
[00:06:40.476 --> 00:06:43.758]  Anything can be national security because nobody's able to answer that.
[00:06:43.818 --> 00:06:49.281]  If you don't get your day in court, if they don't accuse you of anything, you don't have a chance to dispute that national security is involved.
[00:06:49.381 --> 00:06:49.922]  Well, that's the thing.
[00:06:49.942 --> 00:06:50.582]  There's no recourse.
[00:06:51.162 --> 00:06:59.289]  If due process is involved, you get your day in court, and then you get to go in front of a jury of your peers if they don't rig the juries like they do in a lot of federal cases.
[00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:05.114]  I don't know any other country that has a 95% conviction rating besides China and Russia.
[00:07:05.695 --> 00:07:09.458]  And, well, if you look at them, they're not nowhere near as free as the United States is.
[00:07:09.778 --> 00:07:10.319]  Right, right.
[00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:14.963]  Yeah, that's something else we're talking about tonight is jury nullification and the importance of juries.
[00:07:15.743 --> 00:07:25.808]  You know, I guess the key thing is, is we really appreciate the fact that you're speaking out, that you're continuing to pursue this, and that you're just not going to let this drop, because we're not going to let it drop either here.
[00:07:25.948 --> 00:07:34.653]  You know, we're not going to, we'll cover your case, we'll cover other cases, because I'm sure there are going to be other, we've already had a lot of cases where people falsely been, wrongly been put on a no-fly list.
[00:07:34.693 --> 00:07:36.894]  Children even, you know, who could not be a threat to anybody.
[00:07:36.974 --> 00:07:39.956]  So this is, this is something of a bureaucracy that
[00:07:40.537 --> 00:07:49.615]  Is just not answerable to anybody and like anyone they can make mistakes but you know they're not owning up to their mistakes and we can't see their mistakes because they're keeping them secret.
[00:07:50.242 --> 00:07:53.824]  Yeah, there's no reason that the no-fly list cannot incorporate due process.
[00:07:54.505 --> 00:08:08.754]  One way that they could easily fix this entire problem is to place someone under investigation, have the due process tell them that you can't fly because you're an investigation for this, let them lawyer up, and let a judge decide ultimately whether or not they get put in this no-fly list.
[00:08:09.574 --> 00:08:10.375]  Everything else, I mean,
[00:08:11.812 --> 00:08:18.342]  If a child molester and a murderer has a right to due process, why doesn't an average American citizen that hasn't even been accused with a crime?
[00:08:18.522 --> 00:08:19.423]  Good point, good point.
[00:08:20.064 --> 00:08:27.055]  Now, today we have the ongoing Hurricane Sandy that's happening up in the northeast and everything.
[00:08:27.635 --> 00:08:41.405]  And being in Mississippi, one of the things that got you possibly on their radar, as you said, was the fact that you're in the Mississippi Preparedness Organization, and you're suspicious that perhaps somebody might have been thinking that this is some kind of militia or something.
[00:08:41.806 --> 00:08:41.986]  Right.
[00:08:42.826 --> 00:08:49.089]  Well, the Mississippi Preparedness Project really started after Hurricane Katrina when the federal government failed in their response to Katrina.
[00:08:49.649 --> 00:08:53.651]  In Mississippi, we didn't have half the issues that they had in Louisiana because the people took care of themselves.
[00:08:54.671 --> 00:08:57.052]  A lot of people in Mississippi are relatively self-sufficient.
[00:08:57.072 --> 00:08:59.293]  They have weeks worth of food stockpiled.
[00:09:00.282 --> 00:09:05.824]  Normally, they may not even be preppers, but that's just the way that the culture and the environment is in Mississippi.
[00:09:06.264 --> 00:09:11.826]  We know that hurricanes come, and when hurricanes come, we know that we're probably going to go without power for three or more weeks.
[00:09:12.226 --> 00:09:16.788]  So we have to have at least a month of non-perishable foods sitting there waiting
[00:09:17.694 --> 00:09:17.874]  Yeah.
[00:09:17.894 --> 00:09:19.456]  Just for that event and keep it out.
[00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:20.477]  Well, it's a reasonable thing.
[00:09:20.537 --> 00:09:21.938]  I mean, most people used to be that way.
[00:09:22.038 --> 00:09:25.181]  It's like having a bank account so that you're not living from paycheck to paycheck.
[00:09:25.241 --> 00:09:35.751]  I mean, you know, if people are going to do that and be responsible, having food and being able to protect themselves during an emergency, because you never know when that's going to happen, that's a reasonable thing for people to do, too.
[00:09:35.871 --> 00:09:42.497]  People in Mississippi are just not as dependent on the government as a lot of people who live in, say, cities are, that sort of thing.
[00:09:42.637 --> 00:09:48.101]  Well, what the government's really scared of, as far as preparedness is concerned, is they understand that our founders were preppers.
[00:09:48.861 --> 00:09:53.024]  They were prepared for any foreseen or unforeseen event that would happen in their lives.
[00:09:53.645 --> 00:09:54.545]  They had firearms.
[00:09:54.565 --> 00:09:55.386]  They had food.
[00:09:55.806 --> 00:09:57.287]  They had honest money.
[00:09:57.828 --> 00:09:59.649]  They had ways to provide for their families should
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.541]  Work not happen or our crop would fail.
[00:10:02.561 --> 00:10:04.181]  They had ways to provide for their families.
[00:10:04.862 --> 00:10:09.824]  And now what the government seems to be wanting to do to us is to make us completely dependent on them for everything.
[00:10:10.304 --> 00:10:15.526]  So we'll just bow down in blind subservience and say, oh, thank you for that meal.
[00:10:15.866 --> 00:10:18.367]  You know, oh, we'll do whatever you say as long as you feed us.
[00:10:19.128 --> 00:10:25.210]  And we're getting to that point right now that people are so willing to trade their liberty for security it's not even funny.
[00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:26.231]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[00:10:26.731 --> 00:10:28.512]  As a matter of fact, when they moved the
[00:10:29.432 --> 00:10:31.033]  Scanners out of Boston Airport.
[00:10:31.073 --> 00:10:35.135]  I saw mainstream media reports where they were talking to people and saying, you know, do you like these things?
[00:10:35.215 --> 00:10:36.515]  Oh, yeah, they make me feel safe.
[00:10:37.015 --> 00:10:37.956]  They make them feel safe.
[00:10:37.996 --> 00:10:39.336]  They don't provide any safety.
[00:10:39.356 --> 00:10:43.898]  They don't, you know, they actually are irradiating them, right, which they've admitted now.
[00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:49.521]  But, you know, even though it's not doing anything to enhance their security, even though it's exposing them to dangerous radiation,
[00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.372]  The idea is that it makes them feel safe.
[00:10:52.632 --> 00:10:54.014]  Well, I'm not a terrorist.
[00:10:54.054 --> 00:10:58.998]  And I'm sure the people that are walking through the body scanners that are looking at this interview say, well, I'm not a terrorist.
[00:10:59.439 --> 00:11:00.259]  Why do you keep doing it?
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:05.544]  Why do you keep just walking through those machines like, well, I don't want to make any waves.
[00:11:05.564 --> 00:11:06.105]  Well, guess what?
[00:11:06.345 --> 00:11:07.006]  I made waves.
[00:11:07.286 --> 00:11:07.807]  I'm still here.
[00:11:07.827 --> 00:11:08.747]  They didn't kill me yet.
[00:11:09.508 --> 00:11:10.809]  And I'm going to be vocal about it.
[00:11:10.829 --> 00:11:11.330]  That's right.
[00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:17.938]  And I just hope that me being vocal about this doesn't have any sort of negative retaliatory impact on my wife's naval career.
[00:11:18.519 --> 00:11:23.265]  Because if it would, I mean, it just shows completely how messed up our country has become.
[00:11:23.766 --> 00:11:25.508]  And we have the right to fix it.
[00:11:25.548 --> 00:11:26.670]  We have the ballot box.
[00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:28.412]  As long as we have the ballot box,
[00:11:29.153 --> 00:11:30.374]  We do have some means.
[00:11:30.874 --> 00:11:34.336]  But if they take the ballot box away from us, as our founder said, there's only one thing left.
[00:11:34.456 --> 00:11:34.817]  That's right.
[00:11:34.837 --> 00:11:35.277]  That's right.
[00:11:35.697 --> 00:11:36.678]  Well, you have to speak out.
[00:11:37.418 --> 00:11:39.240]  And, you know, you've done the right thing.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:46.244]  And certainly, once they pull you out of the crowd for no apparent reason, I think your best defense is to be public about it.
[00:11:46.644 --> 00:11:47.445]  You've done the right thing.
[00:11:48.465 --> 00:11:49.586]  Thank you for stopping by here.
[00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:52.628]  We really appreciate you coming by, and we really appreciate you fighting this.
[00:11:53.248 --> 00:11:56.991]  And we want to, you know, keep in touch with you and let us know what's going on.
[00:11:57.031 --> 00:12:00.973]  We want to know if you get any answers, or we want to know if you don't get any answers.
[00:12:01.033 --> 00:12:01.674]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:12:01.754 --> 00:12:04.135]  I'm going to keep you all advised the whole process.
[00:12:04.195 --> 00:12:04.696]  Great, great.
[00:12:04.736 --> 00:12:05.436]  Thank you very much, Wayne.
[00:12:05.456 --> 00:12:05.756]  Thank you.
[00:12:06.136 --> 00:12:07.057]  We sure appreciate it, Wade.
[00:12:07.737 --> 00:12:08.238]  Wade Hicks.
[00:12:08.598 --> 00:12:10.299]  We always need to speak up for your rights.
[00:12:10.359 --> 00:12:11.540]  Make sure that you don't lose them.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.022]  As we talked about before, they're always lost through gradual encroachment.
[00:12:15.945 --> 00:12:20.627]  And next week, with less than a week left to the election, you have a chance to speak up at the ballot box.
[00:12:21.027 --> 00:12:28.210]  And we're going to be covering that with live election coverage, election night from 5 to midnight Central Time.
[00:12:28.971 --> 00:12:38.115]  We'll be giving you results and we'll be giving you commentary, as well as commentary not just from us, but from people like Gerald Cilenti and many of the guests that you see on our show from time to time.
[00:12:38.995 --> 00:12:43.557]  And as part of our election coverage, we've got a breaking interview coming up next with Governor Gary Johnson.
[00:12:44.185 --> 00:12:47.086]  Third party candidate, Libertarian nominee for president.
