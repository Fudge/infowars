[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.224]  Welcome to tonight's InfoWars Nightly News broadcast.
[00:00:25.324 --> 00:00:26.406]  It is a leap year.
[00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:27.968]  Wednesday, February 29, 2012.
[00:00:28.448 --> 00:00:30.891]  I'm your host, Aaron Dyches.
[00:00:31.232 --> 00:00:36.698]  Let's take a look at the important stuff we have coming up tonight, because there's something very special on this broadcast.
[00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:43.583]  Are Russia and China ready to strike back against the United States if a conflict ignites in Iran?
[00:00:44.184 --> 00:00:50.548]  Tonight, father of Reaganomics Paul Craig Roberts joins us to talk about the risky business of U.S.
[00:00:50.628 --> 00:00:54.131]  foreign policy in Iran and the shadow war in Syria.
[00:00:54.571 --> 00:01:01.096]  Then, our whole world has become a giant experiment by mad scientists.
[00:01:01.696 --> 00:01:14.404]  The exclusive debut of the brand-new, long-awaited documentary by Alex Jones, New World Order Blueprint of Mad Men, premieres tonight in its entirety for PrisonPlanet.TV subscribers.
[00:01:14.744 --> 00:01:21.088]  As Alex Jones turns the tables on fear, government, not terrorism, poses the real threat.
[00:01:29.943 --> 00:01:38.748]  We turn now to the news, a series of stories about plenty of lies, lots of cover-ups, as well as the covert genocide going on in our world today.
[00:01:39.148 --> 00:01:50.775]  First in that stack, Obama issues policy directive exempting American citizens from indefinite detention, but skeptics fear future administration could still incarcerate US citizens
[00:01:51.235 --> 00:02:06.699]  Under the NDAA, that's Paul Joseph Watson's report, referring to the White House and the fact sheet they released on the new presidential policy directive, explaining the administration would not like to use the kidnapping provision against American citizens, even though it asked for it.
[00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:09.540]  Section 1022 does not apply to U.S.
[00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.782]  citizens, they say, and the president has decided to waive its application to lawful permanent residents arrested in the United States
[00:02:17.202 --> 00:02:20.743]  States, the White House fact sheet, and a link to the PDF.
[00:02:21.003 --> 00:02:22.363]  But what's really going on here?
[00:02:22.723 --> 00:02:36.986]  You've got a president who tells nothing but lies, and they're trying to cover up for the heat they're going to get for the NDAA, which is totally destructive of the Bill of Rights, of our country itself, and the Constitution, and everything we stand for.
[00:02:37.306 --> 00:02:46.128]  And there's been a whole host of these lies, all to make sure people don't get upset at Obama and this Congress for putting this stuff on paper and writing.
[00:02:46.368 --> 00:02:50.090]  Remember, the Patriot Act was a big controversy, even though it wasn't stopped.
[00:02:50.531 --> 00:02:52.792]  Why isn't the NDAA being talked about more?
[00:02:53.092 --> 00:02:54.233]  Well, it finally is.
[00:02:54.273 --> 00:02:59.156]  You've got states revolting and saying they won't go along with the kidnapping provisions.
[00:02:59.436 --> 00:03:05.040]  You've got Virginia almost signing into law the nullification of the NDAA.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.020]  It passed through the House.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.021]  It passed through the Senate.
[00:03:07.261 --> 00:03:08.842]  It's going through reconciliation now.
[00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:10.763]  Other states are looking at that measure.
[00:03:11.143 --> 00:03:15.166]  Now, just remember where Obama's been on this NDAA issue all along.
[00:03:15.586 --> 00:03:19.369]  First was the deception that it did not apply to Americans.
[00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.251]  That turned out not to be true.
[00:03:21.271 --> 00:03:28.197]  Then the president promised he wouldn't sign the legislation, told people that for weeks, for months.
[00:03:28.538 --> 00:03:33.923]  Then it turned out he was going to do a U-turn and kind of reluctantly agreed he was going to sign it.
[00:03:34.383 --> 00:03:41.389]  And the ACLU and the human rights groups and others blasted him for doing so.
[00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:52.482]  Then there was when Carl Levin came out and said, well, we only added the kidnapping Americans provision to the bill because the Obama White House asked us explicitly to do so.
[00:03:52.883 --> 00:04:01.714]  They already had the language in the bill that would have exempted Americans and sidestepped that, but instead it was added at the request of the White House.
[00:04:02.054 --> 00:04:03.055]  Now, what is the White House?
[00:04:03.115 --> 00:04:04.476]  Who is the President anyway?
[00:04:04.536 --> 00:04:08.019]  Does the buck really stop with any one man voted into White House?
[00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:15.405]  Not since they passed the 1947 National Security Act under Truman, who made that quip about the buck stops here.
[00:04:15.786 --> 00:04:29.317]  In fact, it opened the back door to a lot of the globalist policy makers at the CFR and the other groups, including Trilateral and Bilderberg, who really have been coordinating our world government rise and the destruction of the United States for many years.
[00:04:30.137 --> 00:04:37.281]  That's why it's so dangerous, these executive orders, sometimes known as presidential policy directives, and a host of other names.
[00:04:37.321 --> 00:04:39.382]  You can look up how that name has transformed.
[00:04:39.722 --> 00:04:48.347]  But at any rate, Obama has lied repeatedly about the NDAA, when he signed the bill on New Year's Eve when nobody was looking, when he knew the world was out partying.
[00:04:48.807 --> 00:04:52.029]  And not many people were covering it, although we were here at InfoWars.
[00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:58.752]  He still said, well, in his starting statement, I've reluctantly signed this bill, but I'm not going to use it against Americans.
[00:04:58.792 --> 00:04:59.453]  I don't like it.
[00:04:59.873 --> 00:05:01.934]  I find it repugnant, but I signed it into law.
[00:05:02.274 --> 00:05:06.697]  And now here they are again with this executive order saying it doesn't apply to Americans.
[00:05:06.777 --> 00:05:11.879]  Well, how is that going to stop future presidents, whatever may be the intentions of Obama?
[00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:14.481]  So this stuff continues to be extremely dangerous.
[00:05:15.001 --> 00:05:16.802]  You cannot believe what Obama says.
[00:05:17.182 --> 00:05:26.675]  And it really looks like he's just pandering to civil rights groups and a lot of his leftist base as the election year comes up to make sure it doesn't become a bigger issue.
[00:05:27.075 --> 00:05:31.782]  And as I mentioned already, as many states look to nullify that repugnant law.
[00:05:33.038 --> 00:05:39.902]  Now in other news, professor says prevent interspecies genocide, reduce current human numbers.
[00:05:39.982 --> 00:05:49.408]  And this is a Colorado State University professor, Philip Cafaro, in his Climate Ethics and Population Policy document.
[00:05:49.848 --> 00:05:55.752]  You can see it here on the page, Virtue Ethics and the Environment, and it's all about how to fight global warming.
[00:05:56.392 --> 00:05:59.193]  How it won't be enough to just slow population growth.
[00:05:59.513 --> 00:06:01.494]  We're gonna have to reduce current numbers.
[00:06:01.554 --> 00:06:03.334]  Now it's somehow okay to kill people.
[00:06:04.194 --> 00:06:13.157]  It is past time to acknowledge the immense injustice toward other species represented by climate change, he writes, and other human assaults on the biosphere.
[00:06:13.497 --> 00:06:15.898]  The professor goes on to say, oh, he's a professor.
[00:06:15.938 --> 00:06:16.978]  You've got to listen to him.
[00:06:17.358 --> 00:06:20.479]  And to reform our environmental ethics and behavior accordingly.
[00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:30.304]  Going on in other parts of the document, ending human population growth is almost certainly a necessity, but not sufficient to prevent the catastrophic global warming change.
[00:06:31.225 --> 00:06:36.468]  Indeed, significantly reducing current human numbers may be necessary to do so.
[00:06:36.848 --> 00:06:41.071]  In other parts of the document saying, in fact, reducing human population may be necessary.
[00:06:41.411 --> 00:06:46.754]  In other part of the document saying, the question of coercion may not be avoidable forever.
[00:06:47.134 --> 00:06:49.876]  And we always knew the climate change thing was
[00:06:50.476 --> 00:06:51.257]  Going there.
[00:06:51.658 --> 00:07:00.110]  We always knew that it was just another branch of eugenics as that entire model went underground, absorbed environmental movements to achieve its policies.
[00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:05.617]  Al Gore's entire thing with global warming and climate change and the inconvenient hoax.
[00:07:06.058 --> 00:07:06.618]  That's right.
[00:07:22.708 --> 00:07:25.069]  Ethicists telling us why we have to kill people.
[00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:33.611]  Only yesterday it was in the news how university professors in Australia say it's okay to kill newborns up to the age of three.
[00:07:34.051 --> 00:07:38.052]  That infanticide is okay because abortion has already been accepted.
[00:07:38.672 --> 00:07:43.974]  All this stuff just to make us hate ourselves and think humanity is a menace and be convinced of that.
[00:07:44.494 --> 00:07:46.515]  Total deception, like everything else.
[00:07:46.835 --> 00:08:01.139]  Turning now to another set of deception and lies, the TSA issue, as Steve Watson has a report on the government now saying TSA scanners are safe, but actually it's just a regurgitated old report with old info.
[00:08:01.559 --> 00:08:06.881]  TSA head Pistole, a known liar, testified that the report would present new findings.
[00:08:07.241 --> 00:08:08.001]  In fact, it didn't.
[00:08:08.341 --> 00:08:28.347]  That report's linked in our report and PDF form from the Department of Homeland Security's Inspector General, concluding that backscatter radiation machines deliver, quote, an extremely low dose of ionizing radiation below the acceptable limits, just as they changed the acceptable limits for Fukushima and radiation on that issue.
[00:08:29.148 --> 00:08:36.334]  And they go on to quote Johns Hopkins studies again, even though Johns Hopkins came out and said those studies were misrepresented.
[00:08:36.654 --> 00:08:42.039]  You've got the NIST studies that the Department of Homeland Security and TSA cited.
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.022]  NIST said those studies were misrepresented.
[00:08:45.282 --> 00:08:52.188]  You had the big Janet Napolitano USA Today article, where she came out and said body scanners were safe, citing the NIST.
[00:08:52.929 --> 00:08:54.871]  That was all lies and propaganda.
[00:08:55.271 --> 00:09:05.976]  And it goes on and on, because there was a report back in 1998 where they found that these kind of body scanners would increase cancer deaths somewhere on the order of 100 per year.
[00:09:06.476 --> 00:09:09.118]  And remember, there is no safe radiation.
[00:09:09.738 --> 00:09:14.700]  Hospitals and so forth, dentist offices at least adhere to some safety measures.
[00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:19.743]  Who knows if even that stuff is safe, but you've got the TSA not taking those measures.
[00:09:20.563 --> 00:09:24.046]  And you never know what exposure level someone's already going to be at.
[00:09:24.447 --> 00:09:32.174]  People are more at exposure for risk to cancer from radiation than others, so you don't know what's a risk factor in reality.
[00:09:32.475 --> 00:09:35.718]  Then you've got the other lies on the TSA because there's so many.
[00:09:36.198 --> 00:09:43.842]  They're always lying just to make sure they get in these police state measures and you go along with it and shut up and stand in line and go through the radiation machine.
[00:09:44.162 --> 00:09:48.244]  We got the Daily Mail in June 28th of 2011 last summer.
[00:09:48.624 --> 00:09:51.265]  Can TSA scanning machines give you cancer?
[00:09:51.685 --> 00:09:57.268]  New fears after the claim government is covering up clusters of disease among airport workers.
[00:09:57.908 --> 00:10:03.531]  That's at Boston Logan Airport, one of the first, if not the first, to implement the body scanners
[00:10:04.571 --> 00:10:20.050]  And the Electronic Privacy and Information Center, also known as EPIC, did a study found that Homeland Security and TSA were lying, they were obscuring, they were covering up the dangers, and that they were, quote, not being forthcoming with the public about the true extent of the radiation risk.
[00:10:21.431 --> 00:10:32.984]  You've got the ongoing reports about the cancer clusters allegedly linked to radiation exposure with those workers and how they publicly mischaracterized all that and again citing the NIST studies.
[00:10:33.004 --> 00:10:37.128]  You've also got the Paul Watson report, cancer surges and body scanner operators.
[00:10:37.489 --> 00:10:39.030]  TSA launches cover-up.
[00:10:39.611 --> 00:10:42.092]  But you know, I feel sorry for these TSA workers.
[00:10:42.613 --> 00:10:49.936]  I had to go through the airport over the weekend, going to Alex's event out in Orlando, and there's always some kind of little misadventure with them.
[00:10:50.296 --> 00:10:55.419]  This time when we came back through Austin Bergstrom, where, by the way, they just put in the body scanners.
[00:10:55.859 --> 00:11:03.967]  And we saw a little incident where they thought they found a suspicious bag and they blocked hundreds of people from walking through the concourse for several minutes.
[00:11:04.347 --> 00:11:05.308]  Got all freaked out.
[00:11:05.348 --> 00:11:09.192]  You saw a TSA lady running through the crowd pushing people out of the way.
[00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:09.652]  Look out!
[00:11:09.692 --> 00:11:11.254]  I'm going to stop some big danger.
[00:11:11.634 --> 00:11:15.278]  Meanwhile, you're going to hear Paul Craig Roberts later talking about how
[00:11:15.838 --> 00:11:24.804]  All these so-called terrorist plots are admittedly FBI set-ups just to provoke fear in the public and to get their mandate for new powers.
[00:11:25.345 --> 00:11:28.707]  There is no real mass danger from terrorism.
[00:11:28.767 --> 00:11:34.150]  The statistics are very low of exposure to terrorism, danger, deaths by terrorism.
[00:11:34.731 --> 00:11:37.733]  That's if you even believe the phony 9-11 events.
[00:11:37.793 --> 00:11:39.434]  I know our audience knows a lot better.
[00:11:39.794 --> 00:11:50.136]  But I feel sorry for those TSA workers who don't realize that it's that radiation body scanner and the other radiating machines that check the luggage that are actually posing the real danger.
[00:11:50.156 --> 00:12:00.878]  I see the TSA workers sitting maybe a foot away from the big sign on the Backscatter and Raposcan luggage scanning devices.
[00:12:00.938 --> 00:12:01.719]  It says, Danger!
[00:12:01.819 --> 00:12:02.399]  Radiation!
[00:12:02.419 --> 00:12:03.759]  And there they are sitting all day.
[00:12:04.159 --> 00:12:14.449]  Looking at our luggage, breaking the Fourth Amendment, violating the Tenth Amendment, and really just trashing and trampling over the Constitution and Bill of Rights, laughing at anyone who doesn't want to go along with it.
[00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:16.351]  Well, who do you think is at risk?
[00:12:16.371 --> 00:12:18.133]  The people who sit there eight hours a day.
[00:12:18.734 --> 00:12:21.596]  You don't think they have to go through those body scanners on a daily basis?
[00:12:21.616 --> 00:12:23.478]  You don't think that puts them at danger?
[00:12:23.819 --> 00:12:26.081]  Well, you see it in the reports on Boston.
[00:12:26.501 --> 00:12:27.883]  It's just a shame what's going on.
[00:12:28.303 --> 00:12:37.212]  I hope TSA workers will get out of that power mode of feeling that that uniform gives them something they can't get in the rest of life and realize they're hurting people, they're hurting themselves.
[00:12:38.413 --> 00:12:43.097]  Now, I'll stop rambling about it, but it's just such a joke about the terrorism threat.
[00:12:43.357 --> 00:12:48.342]  Wait until you see the documentary that Alex and I and the rest of the crew put together.
[00:12:48.723 --> 00:12:50.845]  All of our new graphics guys contributed to it.
[00:12:50.865 --> 00:12:51.485]  It's going to be great.
[00:12:51.505 --> 00:12:52.806]  It's coming up in just a few minutes.
[00:12:53.387 --> 00:12:59.590]  Turning to other news, the London Telegraph reports on the mystery virus that kills thousands of lambs.
[00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:04.732]  Thousands of lambs have been killed by a new virus threatening the survival of many British farms.
[00:13:05.072 --> 00:13:07.253]  It's also affecting the mainland in Europe.
[00:13:07.573 --> 00:13:08.914]  It's also affecting cattle.
[00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:16.039]  And so, so far they've got 74 farms in the southern and eastern England hit by the mystery virus.
[00:13:16.719 --> 00:13:23.564]  The National Farmers Union has called it a potential catastrophe and warned farmers to be vigilant, saying this is a ticking time bomb.
[00:13:23.985 --> 00:13:28.168]  Alistair McIntosh of the NFU said, we don't yet know the extent of the disease.
[00:13:28.208 --> 00:13:33.191]  We only will find out the damage when sheep and cows give birth, then it's too late.
[00:13:33.252 --> 00:13:35.453]  So these are aborted fetuses.
[00:13:35.513 --> 00:13:36.694]  These are miscarriages.
[00:13:36.754 --> 00:13:37.815]  These are stillborns.
[00:13:38.275 --> 00:13:45.624]  These are heavily deformed animals that, although they're alive when they're born, can't survive because the arms and legs are twisted.
[00:13:45.644 --> 00:13:55.116]  And as they mention here, some farms on the mainland continent of Europe are losing up to half of their lambs, and farms in Britain are so far losing some 20%.
[00:13:56.658 --> 00:13:58.679]  But will they ever look at the real causes?
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:08.745]  Will they look at the supply chains, the factory farming, the government policies that perhaps make these kind of new mystery diseases possible?
[00:14:09.105 --> 00:14:24.154]  Of course, we don't know at this point, but this brings up directly a report that Jeffrey Smith, the premier GMO expert, brought up with Alex last week when they did an interview, not only talking about new confirmations and new evidence of how the extent to which
[00:14:25.034 --> 00:14:31.956]  GMOs are massively damaging the internal organs, the gut flora and triggering sterility and infertility.
[00:14:32.196 --> 00:14:37.077]  You've also got the rise of a new super virus never before seen in science.
[00:14:37.397 --> 00:14:38.958]  They say it acts like a fungus.
[00:14:38.978 --> 00:14:39.978]  They don't know what it is.
[00:14:40.018 --> 00:14:48.460]  It can only be seen under an electron microscope and yet it's getting into livestock and triggering abortions at a 24-hour time period.
[00:14:49.181 --> 00:14:55.050]  No other causes for it, and suddenly livestock are, yeah, having miscarriages and all the other stuff we mentioned.
[00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:55.911]  Is there a connection?
[00:14:55.991 --> 00:14:59.677]  We don't know, but let's play that clip now from Jeffrey Smith, because it's just bombshell.
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:04.761]  I wanted to talk about a new way, one that some of your listeners might be familiar with.
[00:15:05.401 --> 00:15:19.884]  There was a study, a series of analyses done on aborted fetal tissue of livestock where the farmer was beside himself, there was such high rate of abortions, spontaneous abortions.
[00:15:20.404 --> 00:15:27.125]  And on the aborted fetal tissue was a new organism only visible with an electron microscope.
[00:15:27.805 --> 00:15:30.167]  And they figured out, where is this stuff coming from?
[00:15:30.247 --> 00:15:47.063]  So they did analysis of the feed, and when the feed was treated with Roundup, either it was Roundup ready crops or products that had Roundup sprayed, there were high concentrations of this organism, and high concentrations on diseased plants that are known to be getting diseases because of Roundup.
[00:15:48.268 --> 00:15:48.928]  What is it?
[00:15:49.468 --> 00:15:52.370]  They took this organism and they exposed it to a pregnant chicken.
[00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:55.191]  It killed the fetus in 24 to 48 hours.
[00:15:55.951 --> 00:15:58.772]  Now this organism has never been discovered before.
[00:15:59.212 --> 00:16:00.653]  It's completely new to science.
[00:16:00.993 --> 00:16:02.314]  It's the size of a virus.
[00:16:02.674 --> 00:16:04.595]  It operates, it looks like a fungus.
[00:16:05.295 --> 00:16:15.079]  And it appears to be everywhere but in high concentrations around diseased plants and infertile animals and animals that have spontaneous abortions.
[00:16:16.079 --> 00:16:28.988]  So a letter was written by a senior researcher, by Professor Emeritus, in fact, Professor, um, Dr. Don Huber, who had decades of study and was an expert at round-up effects.
[00:16:29.549 --> 00:16:36.093]  He was also on a military group that evaluates the threats of outbreak of disease, both natural and man-made.
[00:16:36.694 --> 00:16:42.398]  And in his letter to Secretary Vilsack of the USDA, he said, this is an emergency.
[00:16:43.078 --> 00:17:06.662]  He pointed out that there is widespread infertility among animals, that there might be a huge link, of course, and that Vilsack should not approve Roundup-Ready alfalfa because that would only increase the exposure of the population to Roundup at a time when we need to put money now into investigating whether this organism is causing the problem and linked to Roundup or GMOs.
[00:17:07.242 --> 00:17:12.066]  He sent that letter on January 17th privately to Secretary Vilsack.
[00:17:12.486 --> 00:17:15.208]  It was leaked onto the internet, so that's why I can talk about it.
[00:17:15.948 --> 00:17:19.631]  He was finally called weeks later by someone from the USDA.
[00:17:19.891 --> 00:17:27.016]  He gave them the names of the researchers, and the researchers have not yet been contacted by the USDA, and that was over a year ago.
[00:17:27.036 --> 00:17:27.637]  Let me stop him.
[00:17:28.317 --> 00:17:46.925]  Turning now to Ron Paul news, he met with Ben Bernanke today at the House Financial Services Committee during his semi-annual visit, and Ron Paul once again grilled Bernanke, the head of the Federal Reserve, asked him about inflation and confronted him, do you buy your own groceries?
[00:17:47.245 --> 00:17:48.926]  Do you see the inflation for yourself?
[00:17:49.306 --> 00:18:08.264]  The official government statistics show only about 2% inflation, but Ron Paul points out here in the clip we're about to watch that the old CPI, the Consumer Price Index, and how the old way of measuring it shows prices actually going up at 9% inflation rate, but he says whatever percentage you want to agree on,
[00:18:08.644 --> 00:18:13.688]  We are losing the value of the dollar and it's the Federal Reserve's policies that are doing it.
[00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:30.761]  And he has a great clip here, but what's not in that clip is we are witnessing today the end stages of a grand experiment, Paul said, adding the Fed's control over the nation's monetary supply has directly caused economic bubbles and all but destroyed the purchasing power of the dollar.
[00:18:31.241 --> 00:18:45.767]  And then you turn to Bernanke news from today, also from that same appearance in the House Financial Services Committee, and it's hopeful news about how the S&P is growing even though he's not signaling for more stimulus.
[00:18:46.047 --> 00:18:51.209]  Well, in fact, they're basically doing QE3, whatever they decide to call it publicly, whether they ever admit it.
[00:18:51.869 --> 00:18:55.511]  But you see in the reports that were posted on Drudge and other sites how
[00:18:55.911 --> 00:18:58.853]  Bernanke dashed hopes for further monetary stimulus.
[00:18:59.813 --> 00:19:04.716]  The market is far from normal, but they hope for increases.
[00:19:04.756 --> 00:19:10.679]  But the gas prices will temporarily surge and push up inflation, reducing the consumer's purchasing power.
[00:19:11.099 --> 00:19:17.082]  And about how people are upset about the end of free money, it's actually helping to further debase our economy.
[00:19:17.463 --> 00:19:21.805]  But of course, this is just Bernanke publicly saying he's not going to continue these
[00:19:22.225 --> 00:19:25.569]  Mr. Bernanke, if you don't mind, would you tell me whether or not you do your own shopping at the grocery store?
[00:19:43.908 --> 00:19:44.348]  Yes, they do.
[00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:46.430]  Okay, so you're aware of the prices.
[00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:50.453]  But you know, this argument that prices are going up about 2%, nobody believes it.
[00:19:50.873 --> 00:19:54.456]  You know, the old CPI says prices are going up at 9%, they believe this.
[00:19:54.856 --> 00:19:56.877]  If people have fixed incomes, they're really hurting.
[00:19:57.078 --> 00:20:05.564]  The middle class is really hurting because their inflation rate is very much higher than the government tries to tell them, and that's why they lose trust in government.
[00:20:06.044 --> 00:20:15.457]  But you know, this whole idea about prices and debasement of currency, if you loaned me $100 and in two years from now I gave you $90 back, you'd be pretty upset.
[00:20:16.098 --> 00:20:20.144]  But we hand money back that's worth 10 or 15 or 20% less.
[00:20:22.607 --> 00:20:26.388]  And nobody seems to be able to do anything about it, but it's very upsetting.
[00:20:26.688 --> 00:20:27.468]  But it's theft.
[00:20:27.528 --> 00:20:33.350]  If I don't give you your full $100 back, if you loan me $100, I'm stealing $10 from you.
[00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:36.110]  So somebody's stealing wealth, and this is very upsetting.
[00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:43.432]  This ounce of silver, back in 2006, would buy over four gallons of gasoline.
[00:20:44.332 --> 00:20:48.934]  Today, today it'll buy almost 11 gallons of gasoline.
[00:20:49.334 --> 00:20:54.996]  That's preservation of value, and that's what the market has always said should be money.
[00:20:55.477 --> 00:21:03.440]  Money comes into effect in a natural way, not in an edict, not by fiat, by governments declaring it is money.
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:12.603]  And with more on that, we turn now to former Assistant Secretary to the Treasury under Reagan, better known as the father of Reaganomics, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:21:12.623 --> 00:21:13.484]  Thanks for joining us, sir.
[00:21:14.204 --> 00:21:14.985]  Pleased to be with you.
[00:21:16.146 --> 00:21:17.467]  I know there's a lot going on.
[00:21:17.987 --> 00:21:26.073]  Economics issues, of course, always up front because they're always downplaying the inflation rate, but we continue to have total economic devastation.
[00:21:26.113 --> 00:21:27.254]  What's your outlook on that, sir?
[00:21:28.936 --> 00:21:30.076]  Well, there's no recovery.
[00:21:30.717 --> 00:21:32.939]  There can't be because the jobs are offshored.
[00:21:35.636 --> 00:21:41.678]  Consumers have no increase in their income to support a growth in consumer demand.
[00:21:41.698 --> 00:21:51.280]  They can't borrow anymore because they're too deeply in debt and the banks are too insolvent to lend, and so the economy is just dead in the water.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.521]  And we'll stay that way for some time.
[00:21:54.541 --> 00:21:59.062]  In fact, most likely later this year it'll drop further.
[00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:02.141]  And so there's fresh reports today.
[00:22:02.161 --> 00:22:03.462]  It was linked on the Drudge Report.
[00:22:03.642 --> 00:22:06.144]  S&P 500 logs best start to the year since 91.
[00:22:06.204 --> 00:22:08.706]  Kind of a hopeful sounding headline.
[00:22:09.487 --> 00:22:14.731]  But in this and other coverage, they've definitely indicated that QE3 may finally be officially on the table.
[00:22:15.331 --> 00:22:21.516]  I know a lot of people who follow the issue have been saying it's pretty much been going on in a de facto sense anyway.
[00:22:22.497 --> 00:22:23.818]  And we were bringing up this issue as well.
[00:22:25.509 --> 00:22:32.070]  Well, it seems to me that it has to be going on in order for the Federal Reserve to keep the interest rates near zero.
[00:22:33.351 --> 00:22:45.793]  If you're not buying bonds, one would think that the rate would rise because the inflation is certainly there and all of the interest rates are negative at this time.
[00:22:46.953 --> 00:22:51.875]  So when you have a negative interest rate on a 30-year bond, it has to be fixed in some way.
[00:22:51.895 --> 00:22:53.975]  The Fed has to be fixing the price.
[00:22:55.575 --> 00:22:59.117]  So, you know, they will deny QE3.
[00:22:59.937 --> 00:23:02.138]  In fact, isn't that what Bernanke did today?
[00:23:02.939 --> 00:23:04.380]  Didn't he say no more stimulus?
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.161]  And so the gold market collapsed.
[00:23:07.241 --> 00:23:08.402]  Why does anyone believe him?
[00:23:09.747 --> 00:23:12.749]  And so gold did fall a pretty large number.
[00:23:12.789 --> 00:23:15.791]  I didn't see the exact numbers, but maybe they can pull them up on the screen.
[00:23:15.811 --> 00:23:18.112]  It's down $90 right now.
[00:23:18.132 --> 00:23:22.455]  It fell $100, which is quite a big drop.
[00:23:23.435 --> 00:23:32.701]  And it seems like it's all, you know, once the money managers and the hedge funds got into gold investments, it changed the nature of the market.
[00:23:34.689 --> 00:23:35.849]  It's made it more volatile.
[00:23:36.009 --> 00:23:38.550]  It drives it up and it also drives it down.
[00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:42.751]  So apparently all the money managers and hedge funds sold their gold positions.
[00:23:43.571 --> 00:23:45.811]  Because apparently they believe Bernanke.
[00:23:47.752 --> 00:23:49.852]  That he's going to leave the economy dead in the water.
[00:23:50.732 --> 00:24:02.695]  And that we're going to go into an election dead in the water or maybe even with the second down leg of this depression coming into play.
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:04.900]  Yes, sir.
[00:24:05.301 --> 00:24:10.904]  And so turning to foreign policy issues, you've got the most recent column silencing the critics.
[00:24:11.324 --> 00:24:18.109]  You bring up a lot of elements of the attack on the domestic extremists and the FBI's paranoia and all their cooked up cases.
[00:24:18.589 --> 00:24:31.597]  And of course, as we continue to march towards war in Syria and Iran and generally in that region, stoking Russia, there's a lot of important stuff going on with the Russian elections and I guess the larger Washington-based
[00:24:32.498 --> 00:24:37.740]  Well, I think one of the most important things is that the United States, if it proceeds with the Syrian and particularly the Iranian attacks,
[00:24:54.432 --> 00:25:06.981]  It shows that it's prepared to be more and more unilateral because it no longer has the cover of a UN resolution for the attack on Iran.
[00:25:07.701 --> 00:25:14.026]  That was vetoed by China and Russia, and it no longer has a coalition of the willing.
[00:25:14.086 --> 00:25:17.248]  It's got one British warship and one French warship.
[00:25:19.913 --> 00:25:37.785]  So it means that if they do go ahead with an attack on Iran, that Washington is prepared to be very unilateral and to risk a more direct confrontation with Russia and China.
[00:25:38.706 --> 00:25:43.529]  Now the situation in Syria is they're going to attempt to do the same thing they did in Libya.
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:56.307]  And quite clearly they're not interested in Syrian democracy because Assad had the referendum and the vast majority of the people who voted supported it.
[00:25:57.168 --> 00:26:07.014]  And what they support is the rise of political parties and the prospect of a different party governing
[00:26:08.254 --> 00:26:09.475]  Syria and Assad.
[00:26:10.056 --> 00:26:14.459]  And you would think that Washington really liked democracy, they would get behind this.
[00:26:14.539 --> 00:26:15.740]  But no, they denounced it.
[00:26:17.782 --> 00:26:23.186]  They denounced it and they are determined to overthrow Assad.
[00:26:23.306 --> 00:26:32.273]  And this also brings more risk of confrontation with Russia because of the Russian naval base at Tartus.
[00:26:33.471 --> 00:26:41.576]  And the Russians quite clearly see that this is an effort on the part of the United States to evict them from the Mediterranean.
[00:26:42.657 --> 00:27:01.810]  So as Washington goes forward with these wars, they are risking more and more direct confrontation with nuclear armed powers, Russia and China, neither one of which we would be able to invade or occupy or
[00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:10.377]  If they can't occupy Baghdad or Fallujah, how are they going to occupy Beijing or Moscow?
[00:27:11.038 --> 00:27:13.420]  So it's becoming absurd.
[00:27:15.062 --> 00:27:21.688]  It must be hubris and arrogance running very strong in the veins of the Washington policymakers.
[00:27:22.288 --> 00:27:23.690]  And it puts us all at risk.
[00:27:24.807 --> 00:27:29.072]  Well, of course they're interested in democracy the way a duck hunter is interested in using a decoy.
[00:27:30.053 --> 00:27:39.544]  But they've not only launched the whole Arab Spring movement and everything going on in the Middle East, but they're using that same democracy wedge to put pressure on Putin and Russia.
[00:27:39.764 --> 00:27:40.786]  Let's talk about that issue.
[00:27:41.787 --> 00:27:43.969]  Well, the Russian opposition
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:56.663]  Is of course financed by the NGOs that get the money from the National Endowment for Democracy, which many people regard as the CIA front.
[00:27:57.263 --> 00:28:02.084]  And it was set up to destabilize America's enemies.
[00:28:02.825 --> 00:28:07.786]  So Putin is faced with a disloyal opposition.
[00:28:09.415 --> 00:28:23.004]  And the importance of the March elections is that it could actually result in protests after the election that could be violent.
[00:28:24.085 --> 00:28:36.272]  Putin himself recently said that the Russian police have reason to believe that the opposition may actually kill some prominent person so that Putin can be blamed.
[00:28:37.563 --> 00:28:48.550]  And it caused massive unrest in Russia at a time when the United States might strike Syria or Iran.
[00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:56.494]  And the protests in Russia would kind of make it difficult for the Russian government to respond.
[00:28:56.514 --> 00:29:02.138]  So this is a risk that no doubt the Israelis are pushing for.
[00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:08.593]  Some sort of attack just after the Russian elections.
[00:29:10.795 --> 00:29:16.038]  And clearly they're hoping to tie Russia's hand so they can launch that attack and hopefully take advantage of them.
[00:29:16.678 --> 00:29:23.762]  How much does this have to do with oil and China's kind of burgeoning empire and how much does it have to do with the larger Grand Chess Board?
[00:29:24.763 --> 00:29:31.127]  Yes, I think it has a great deal to do with trying to deny China independent
[00:29:32.227 --> 00:29:32.447]  I don't
[00:29:44.239 --> 00:29:51.963]  And China has very large investments in Iran and gets, you know, between 20 and 30 percent of its oil from Iran.
[00:29:52.843 --> 00:29:57.825]  And this, of course, was the policy that the United States used against Japan in the 1930s.
[00:29:57.986 --> 00:30:10.111]  It saw Japan a rising power, and so it cut Japan off from oil and strategic materials and rubber, and Pearl Harbor was the result.
[00:30:12.032 --> 00:30:13.553]  They're trying the same thing with China.
[00:30:13.593 --> 00:30:21.959]  They want to be sure that China doesn't have independent access to energy, or not much independent access.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:25.621]  They can't do that to Russia because it has so much energy.
[00:30:26.562 --> 00:30:38.110]  And I think the various pipelines that Russia and China will build to connect those two countries will certainly defeat Washington's.
[00:30:38.769 --> 00:30:43.332]  Plans, but they are directed at China's energy supply.
[00:30:44.353 --> 00:30:46.994]  Obviously, it's risky to overextend an empire.
[00:30:47.094 --> 00:30:59.382]  Obviously, we were never set up to be an empire, but I guess what gets me is whatever moves they calculate, they always rely on us being totally stupid, like we can never figure any of this out, and we're always supposed to fall for every false attack they set up.
[00:31:00.082 --> 00:31:02.264]  I mean, where do we, how do we deal with that?
[00:31:03.342 --> 00:31:06.044]  Well, but you see, most of the time they're right.
[00:31:06.805 --> 00:31:08.487]  Most people do fall for it.
[00:31:09.448 --> 00:31:23.360]  I would bet that if the average conservative American, the average Republican, was witnessing what I'm saying right now, they'd be screaming and yelling at me, a pinko liberal commie, unpatriotic.
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:28.825]  You see, they think that if you don't support everything the government says, that you're anti-American.
[00:31:29.673 --> 00:31:30.514]  They don't understand.
[00:31:30.554 --> 00:31:44.923]  They have any concept of patriotism means supporting the Constitution, supporting the truth, trying to keep your country out of trouble, and trying to keep other people from being victimized by your country.
[00:31:44.963 --> 00:31:46.925]  That's what patriotism is, but they don't know that.
[00:31:47.825 --> 00:31:52.508]  And if I was in a live audience saying this, I'd be probably stoned to death.
[00:31:53.108 --> 00:31:55.130]  That's just what Americans are like.
[00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:56.230]  They don't catch on.
[00:31:57.871 --> 00:32:00.693]  The real question is, is the rest of the world catching on?
[00:32:01.343 --> 00:32:02.163]  And that's what H.G.
[00:32:02.263 --> 00:32:07.066]  Wells says always happens to philosophers and thinkers, and they always get stoned to death.
[00:32:07.406 --> 00:32:15.590]  Anyway, what did you think of Obama's move to issue a presidential directive saying, yeah, we're not going to use the indefinite detention against Americans, I say so.
[00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:23.273]  Sure, the power may be on the books for future presidents, but states are starting to pass resolutions saying they won't go along with the NDAA.
[00:32:23.654 --> 00:32:28.236]  After all the deceptions on the NDAA issue, is he beginning to feel pressure?
[00:32:28.256 --> 00:32:30.277]  Is that why they put out this presidential directive?
[00:32:31.061 --> 00:32:31.501]  I don't know.
[00:32:32.401 --> 00:32:32.821]  I don't know.
[00:32:32.921 --> 00:32:40.683]  I don't know whether the American Civil Liberties Union would be able to find standing to bring a constitutional case.
[00:32:41.824 --> 00:32:54.187]  I think if a constitutional case was brought, even the Republican right-wing Supreme Court would have to rule that the National Defense Authorization Act is unconstitutional.
[00:32:55.087 --> 00:33:00.871]  And if they didn't, of course, it would probably sink the Republicans.
[00:33:01.672 --> 00:33:04.293]  But, you know, I just don't think any of them can be believed.
[00:33:04.373 --> 00:33:05.734]  I wouldn't believe Obama.
[00:33:05.834 --> 00:33:11.638]  I mean, he's just maybe trying to cool down some heat.
[00:33:11.658 --> 00:33:15.821]  But look, 93 senators, I think it was 93, voted for it.
[00:33:19.043 --> 00:33:23.086]  I mean, 93% of the Senate voted to deep six.
[00:33:24.258 --> 00:33:25.739]  The United States Constitution.
[00:33:26.739 --> 00:33:27.239]  And why?
[00:33:27.859 --> 00:33:29.020]  For what reason?
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:32.061]  I mean, where's the threat that requires this?
[00:33:34.301 --> 00:33:44.145]  You would think by now, the United States, after murdering huge numbers of Muslims, you know, women, children, men, village elders,
[00:33:44.841 --> 00:33:48.342]  For over a decade, that there would be terrorists everywhere.
[00:33:48.582 --> 00:33:51.884]  Shopping centers throughout the country would be blowing up every day.
[00:33:52.804 --> 00:33:54.725]  Everything, power stations.
[00:33:55.825 --> 00:33:59.627]  It would all be, the country would be in ruins, you'd think by now.
[00:33:59.647 --> 00:34:01.147]  Well, but just nothing has happened.
[00:34:02.428 --> 00:34:06.929]  I guess it goes back to... There's not been a single terrorist event.
[00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:11.031]  And so the FBI has to go out and concoct them and make them up.
[00:34:12.238 --> 00:34:16.419]  And find some poor stupid guy and put him up to an FBI plot.
[00:34:16.499 --> 00:34:17.660]  And you're not just saying that.
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:21.501]  They've admitted dozens and dozens of these cases were total sting operations.
[00:34:22.001 --> 00:34:22.981]  Yeah, that's all they are.
[00:34:23.022 --> 00:34:24.042]  There's no real cases.
[00:34:24.862 --> 00:34:30.824]  And so what is the threat that required deep-sixing the Constitution?
[00:34:35.298 --> 00:34:40.860]  And why didn't this cause the people to revolt?
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:44.781]  Don't they understand the Constitution is what the country is?
[00:34:45.301 --> 00:34:46.902]  I mean the country was repealed.
[00:34:48.962 --> 00:34:51.984]  And they just sit there like, duh, you know.
[00:34:52.925 --> 00:34:54.666]  Oh, it'll never apply to us.
[00:34:54.746 --> 00:34:55.806]  It's only for terrorists.
[00:34:56.286 --> 00:34:56.787]  It's a shame.
[00:34:57.507 --> 00:35:02.290]  It'll apply to whoever the government wants to apply it to because no evidence is required.
[00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:08.013]  We would never know if it was applied to terrorists because there's no evidence.
[00:35:08.033 --> 00:35:09.234]  You don't have to show anything.
[00:35:10.345 --> 00:35:12.866]  It's a shame though, because the Patriot Act was horrible.
[00:35:12.946 --> 00:35:17.268]  It was also doing away with large sections of the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:35:17.568 --> 00:35:19.129]  But there's at least a debate about it.
[00:35:19.169 --> 00:35:24.111]  It was a public controversy to the general public, even if nothing was changed or stopped.
[00:35:24.411 --> 00:35:28.653]  But the NDAA, it's been all this game of smiling and pretending it's not going to happen.
[00:35:29.094 --> 00:35:31.855]  I guess that kind of crocodile style of attacking in politics.
[00:35:35.566 --> 00:35:47.492]  I don't know what else to say about it other than the country was stolen, because the country is the Constitution, and stolen by a handful of people in Washington.
[00:35:47.733 --> 00:35:48.393]  And why?
[00:35:48.473 --> 00:35:49.634]  What is the real agenda?
[00:35:50.594 --> 00:35:52.095]  It can't be terrorism.
[00:35:52.155 --> 00:35:53.055]  There's just not any.
[00:35:53.856 --> 00:35:56.757]  I mean, we can say, oh, well, the Taliban are terrorists.
[00:35:56.797 --> 00:35:57.818]  They're killing our troops.
[00:35:57.878 --> 00:35:59.239]  But we're occupying their country.
[00:36:00.525 --> 00:36:01.966]  So they're not terrorists.
[00:36:03.508 --> 00:36:06.070]  There's no acts of terrorism in the United States.
[00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:08.312]  So what is the reason for this?
[00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:13.553]  And we are premiering Alex's new documentary tonight on this program.
[00:36:13.933 --> 00:36:15.634]  Hopefully you'll have a chance to check it out later.
[00:36:15.674 --> 00:36:17.155]  But we show some of the statistics.
[00:36:17.555 --> 00:36:19.036]  Scientific American covered it.
[00:36:19.056 --> 00:36:25.140]  A lot of other statistics show things like bee stings or slipping in the shower kill more people than terrorism.
[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:26.521]  It's just a total hoax.
[00:36:27.002 --> 00:36:28.503]  Ordinary life is more dangerous.
[00:36:28.543 --> 00:36:30.284]  Driving down the road is more dangerous.
[00:36:30.684 --> 00:36:31.485]  So many things.
[00:36:32.659 --> 00:36:33.019]  Right.
[00:36:33.519 --> 00:36:34.660]  That's exactly the case.
[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:37.441]  Look, the War on Terror is a hoax.
[00:36:37.741 --> 00:36:38.701]  I've said it before.
[00:36:39.402 --> 00:36:40.742]  There aren't any terrorists.
[00:36:40.842 --> 00:36:41.442]  It's a hoax.
[00:36:42.463 --> 00:36:46.464]  It was a hoax to destroy the Constitution and gain unlimited power.
[00:36:47.345 --> 00:36:52.147]  And it was a hoax to start these wars in the Middle East.
[00:36:52.947 --> 00:36:54.968]  There's no basis for it.
[00:36:54.988 --> 00:36:58.689]  There's no evidence of this terrorist stuff.
[00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:02.071]  And especially after they claim they killed Bin Laden.
[00:37:02.311 --> 00:37:04.912]  I mean, he was already dead for 10 years, but they killed him again.
[00:37:05.832 --> 00:37:16.917]  So if Al Qaeda is such a pathetic organization that it leaves its mastermind in a house and
[00:37:17.845 --> 00:37:22.689]  Unarmed, with no troops, no guards, and two women to protect.
[00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:25.611]  Then obviously it's not a threat.
[00:37:25.711 --> 00:37:27.412]  Al Qaeda couldn't possibly be a threat.
[00:37:27.832 --> 00:37:37.119]  If that's how they protect the mastermind, the leader, the most dangerous man on earth, Rumsfeld, Tobles, or Cheney, or both of them.
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:41.903]  And obviously the organization doesn't even exist.
[00:37:43.581 --> 00:37:52.272]  But I guess you take a questionable staged death to cover up for questions of providence and questions of birth and that whole thing with Obama and his birth certificate.
[00:37:52.292 --> 00:37:53.173]  A whole other issue, but...
[00:37:54.571 --> 00:38:05.740]  Well, I think the whole thing was done, of course it was a hoax, it was done to boost Obama in the polls so the Democrats would not challenge him for the nomination.
[00:38:06.641 --> 00:38:19.311]  You know, he was so low down that some of the Democrats were talking about running somebody against him in the nomination for, in other words, not just give the sitting president the nomination.
[00:38:20.057 --> 00:38:26.118]  So I think it was done to boost his standing and to stop any challenge from within the party.
[00:38:27.259 --> 00:38:37.121]  Now, of course, he doesn't really have a challenge from the Republicans because they massed such a collection of dopes, idiots, that nobody would vote for them.
[00:38:37.181 --> 00:38:42.542]  I mean, clearly Obama will win re-election.
[00:38:42.682 --> 00:38:45.903]  I mean, unless something just dramatically terrible happens.
[00:38:47.629 --> 00:38:50.432]  Paul Craig Roberts, for years you didn't have your own website.
[00:38:50.452 --> 00:38:52.635]  You appeared on so many other great Patriot websites.
[00:38:52.675 --> 00:38:55.639]  I want to make sure people have a chance to check out your work at your blog.
[00:38:55.979 --> 00:38:59.063]  Tell them where it is and how often you're going to be posting content there.
[00:39:00.005 --> 00:39:01.927]  It's paulcraigroberts.org.
[00:39:03.168 --> 00:39:03.668]  That simple.
[00:39:04.269 --> 00:39:05.330]  It's that simple.
[00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:09.913]  And all of my columns for the last 10 years are posted on it.
[00:39:10.093 --> 00:39:12.114]  And some other things.
[00:39:12.214 --> 00:39:16.898]  And I tend to write a good deal, though I haven't the last week or so.
[00:39:17.498 --> 00:39:19.500]  So there's almost always something on it.
[00:39:20.951 --> 00:39:21.552]  Something new.
[00:39:22.433 --> 00:39:23.715]  But there's enough there.
[00:39:23.815 --> 00:39:27.200]  I mean, you'd have to read for a long time to get through all of it.
[00:39:27.561 --> 00:39:27.821]  Yeah.
[00:39:28.903 --> 00:39:32.548]  Well, we appreciate you joining us and we appreciate your work as well, of course.
[00:39:33.229 --> 00:39:33.830]  Thank you, sir.
[00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:35.332]  And we'll talk to you in the future.
[00:39:36.053 --> 00:39:36.774]  Look forward to it.
[00:39:37.294 --> 00:39:46.241]  And we'll be back from break, but after that, we will be premiering the new documentary, New World Order, Blueprint of Mad Men, Alex's latest documentary.
[00:39:46.601 --> 00:39:49.284]  It's going to be right here for PrisonPlanet.TV subscribers.
[00:39:49.644 --> 00:39:51.465]  It'll be out there for the public later on.
[00:39:51.766 --> 00:39:53.707]  So we hope you stay tuned and watch that.
[00:39:53.827 --> 00:39:54.548]  It's 40 minutes long.
[00:39:54.908 --> 00:39:55.889]  Thanks and good night.
[00:40:26.877 --> 00:40:30.778]  And it's time to get out of the comfort zone, because these people aren't playing games.
[00:40:30.798 --> 00:40:31.898]  9-11 wants an inside job!
[00:40:31.918 --> 00:40:32.538]  9-11 wants an inside job!
[00:40:32.558 --> 00:40:33.238]  9-11 wants an inside job!
[00:40:33.258 --> 00:40:34.218]  9-11 wants an inside job!
[00:40:34.238 --> 00:40:34.838]  9-11 wants an inside job!
[00:40:34.858 --> 00:40:35.559]  9-11 wants an inside job!
[00:40:35.579 --> 00:40:36.299]  9-11 wants an inside job!
[00:40:36.319 --> 00:40:37.339]  9-11 wants an inside job!
[00:40:37.359 --> 00:40:37.919]  9-11 wants an inside job!
[00:40:37.939 --> 00:40:41.500]  9-11 wants an inside job!
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:42.340]  9-11 wants an inside job!
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:43.180]  9-11 wants an inside job!
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:43.700]  9-11 wants an inside job!
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:44.500]  9-11 wants an inside job!
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:45.180]  9-11 wants an inside job!
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:45.800]  9-11 wants an inside job!
[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:47.561]  9-11 wants an inside job!
[00:40:47.581 --> 00:40:48.341]  9-11 wants an inside job!
[00:40:48.361 --> 00:40:49.481]  9-11 wants an inside job!
[00:40:49.501 --> 00:40:50.461]  9-11 wants an inside job!
[00:40:50.481 --> 00:40:51.141]  9-11 wants an inside job!
[00:40:51.161 --> 00:40:51.921]  9-11 wants an inside job!
[00:40:51.941 --> 00:40:53.122]  9-11 wants an inside job!
[00:40:53.142 --> 00:40:53.962]  9-11 wants an inside job!
[00:40:53.982 --> 00:40:54.682]  9-11 wants an inside job!
[00:40:54.702 --> 00:40:54.842]  9-11 wants
[00:41:08.527 --> 00:41:10.529]  Yeah, I'm signing these evil 1776 flags.
[00:41:10.649 --> 00:41:20.257]  Doesn't get any more out of control than that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:21.778 --> 00:41:24.580]  It's pretty un-American what we're doing here at InfoWars.com.
[00:41:27.062 --> 00:41:32.707]  I mean, not only are we promoting liberty, but we're selling 1776 flags.
[00:41:33.707 --> 00:41:34.188]  Now that
[00:41:37.076 --> 00:41:38.157]  Thanks for watching!
[00:41:54.821 --> 00:42:17.396]  We are back from break as we mentioned at the top of the show this is a special episode of the InfoWars Nightly News because we have a very special debut premiere tonight here for you for PrisonPlanet.TV members but first we turn to today's daily quote and it is the majority rule only works if you're also considering individual rights because you can't have
[00:42:17.876 --> 00:42:21.601]  Five wolves and one sheep voting on what to have for supper.
[00:42:21.941 --> 00:42:33.615]  That's Larry Flint essentially reflecting many of the quotes of the founding fathers including Benjamin Franklin and others who talked about two wolves and a sheep voting for what's for dinner under quote-unquote democracy.
[00:42:34.266 --> 00:42:40.909]  Now, what you're about to see is a 40-minute special documentary titled The New World Order Blueprint of Madness.
[00:42:41.269 --> 00:42:49.673]  And this was the special premiere that audiences, the sold-out audiences I might add, saw in the past week in both Orlando and Dallas, Texas.
[00:42:50.093 --> 00:42:55.175]  It was an accompaniment to Alex's speaking event, The Blueprint to Defeat the New World Order.
[00:42:55.576 --> 00:43:00.558]  First highlighting how crazy and out of control their own plans and most of all this hoax
[00:43:01.118 --> 00:43:16.608]  It totally turns the tables on the hoax of terrorism because statistically, historically, factually, reading between the lines, looking forward to history, it is government and those who control government who are the real threat to humanity.
[00:43:16.728 --> 00:43:26.715]  It is not the hoax threat of terrorism of Osama bin Laden, of al-Qaeda hiding in every closet and under every bed as a mass threat.
[00:43:26.795 --> 00:43:28.136]  It's totally ridiculous.
[00:43:28.416 --> 00:43:30.938]  You're going to see that in statistics in just a few moments.
[00:43:31.318 --> 00:43:36.100]  But it's also got humor that I know a lot of people have seen because we posted it on the website.
[00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:43.664]  Alex portraying one of these empowered citizen snitches working for Homeland Security, trying to find a terrorist.
[00:43:43.784 --> 00:43:44.684]  Is there a terrorist?
[00:43:45.104 --> 00:43:46.165]  Are they in a coffee shop?
[00:43:46.245 --> 00:43:48.486]  Are they using cash to conceal their identity?
[00:43:48.866 --> 00:43:51.107]  Are they using the internet or a proxy server?
[00:43:51.447 --> 00:43:56.049]  Are they having some sort of transportation suspicious activity?
[00:43:56.089 --> 00:43:57.910]  Do they have a model airplane hobby?
[00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:14.410]  All these things and so much more wearing Levi's has been considered by our government for decades now to be suspicious activity, potential right-wing extremist activity, potential al-Qaeda activity, potential left-wing or animal rights extremist activity.
[00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:16.132]  No, it's just Americans.
[00:44:16.452 --> 00:44:18.054]  You've got people with political voices.
[00:44:18.094 --> 00:44:19.916]  You've got people who are returning veterans.
[00:44:20.277 --> 00:44:32.652]  Yeah, they may have their issues because they're serving in illegal wars and they don't feel good about it, but you want to brand them, demonize them, and tell them you might lock them up under the NDAA while you tell everyone else there's nothing to worry about with the NDAA.
[00:44:33.132 --> 00:44:50.988]  It's ridiculous and we're here tonight to shatter that myth, to show you how government just in the 20th century has killed over 262 million people by governments, by dictators, through the swords, through guns, through starvation and that's just getting started because that
[00:44:51.428 --> 00:45:18.282]  Dangerous power put in the hands of centralized government has been further wielded by the special elitist powers who have a greater agenda for world government, for this corporatist dominance of the entire earth, for a return to neo-feudalism, and they seek now not to kill hundreds of millions, but billions through their covert war strategies, through the age-old act, I might add, of siege, using food and water as a weapon, putting chemicals in there.
[00:45:19.202 --> 00:45:35.134]  The effects of GMOs as the elite themselves avoid them like the plague and how, just by mentioning it, they've brought back the Black Death Plague and how eugenicists for centuries have advocated bringing back the Black Plague.
[00:45:35.154 --> 00:45:36.735]  I'm rambling here.
[00:45:36.875 --> 00:45:39.818]  You know many of these issues of the dangers we face.
[00:45:40.158 --> 00:45:45.562]  It was outlined in the masterpiece film Endgame and their whole strategy there and what they're trying to accomplish.
[00:45:45.902 --> 00:45:48.384]  But here, we're just simply trying to expose that myth.
[00:45:48.724 --> 00:45:50.085]  I hope you enjoy this film.
[00:45:50.165 --> 00:45:54.067]  It's going to be out for the public soon to share with everyone to try to warn them.
[00:45:54.407 --> 00:46:00.230]  But for those of you supporting this broadcast, who've signed up as subscribers, thank you so much for making this possible.
[00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:01.851]  We feel your support out there.
[00:46:01.931 --> 00:46:05.613]  We know you're engaged in these issues, concerned about what direction we're going.
[00:46:05.973 --> 00:46:07.154]  So watch this for yourself.
[00:46:07.454 --> 00:46:10.096]  Become reinvigorated and share it with everyone.
[00:46:10.216 --> 00:46:10.556]  Everyone.
[00:46:10.676 --> 00:46:10.976]  Everyone.
[00:46:11.016 --> 00:46:11.937]  Just get this film out there.
[00:46:12.377 --> 00:46:17.620]  And so this is Alex Jones's new film, New World Order, Blueprint of the Mad Men.
[00:46:18.381 --> 00:46:19.224]  Damn, are they crazy.
[00:46:31.508 --> 00:46:45.058]  Even though I'm just a lowly person and aren't part of the greater supreme homeland people in black uniforms that I look up to, I'm still part of the federal family that Janet talks about because I snoop for them.
[00:46:45.698 --> 00:46:47.640]  And that's what America's about.
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:49.802]  Total schizophrenic paranoia.
[00:46:49.982 --> 00:46:54.085]  Absolutely thinking terrorists are hiding under every table.
[00:46:56.050 --> 00:47:00.373]  Just think, they all look normal, but you know any of them could be a terrorist.
[00:47:01.453 --> 00:47:02.774]  Don't trust the public.
[00:47:03.095 --> 00:47:07.237]  Only trust Janet, Big Sis, Napolitano and Homeland Security.
[00:47:08.498 --> 00:47:09.559]  That's what I've learned.
[00:47:10.379 --> 00:47:11.320]  And that's what I do.
[00:47:14.382 --> 00:47:17.123]  Yeah, it's in the communities against terrorism alerts.
[00:47:17.644 --> 00:47:18.985]  They put out hundreds of them.
[00:47:19.325 --> 00:47:22.287]  They say people wearing blue jeans are using cell phones with the terrorists.
[00:47:23.231 --> 00:47:34.155]  I work at a local internet cafe, coffee shop, and they told me that there were people doing stuff like trying to have privacy or using voice over IP or communicating through PC games.
[00:47:34.695 --> 00:47:36.696]  Man, there's nothing these terrorists won't do.
[00:47:37.136 --> 00:47:41.017]  But the number one thing they said was they use cash or credit cards.
[00:47:41.538 --> 00:47:43.118]  That's the really scary part.
[00:47:43.558 --> 00:47:50.941]  There's a lot of them come in there, a lot of them using cash, and some of them even want to be anonymous and have privacy when they search
[00:47:54.508 --> 00:47:57.390]  We realized that most of the population are terrorists.
[00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:01.612]  There's so many people using cell phones.
[00:48:02.272 --> 00:48:07.015]  There's so many people who've got screen blockers so I can't read what they're saying.
[00:48:07.215 --> 00:48:09.516]  There's even more using cash.
[00:48:11.017 --> 00:48:12.078]  I'm a terrorist.
[00:48:13.499 --> 00:48:14.299]  I'm a terrorist.
[00:48:14.559 --> 00:48:16.020]  Hold yourself together.
[00:48:38.962 --> 00:48:41.604]  You always wanted to be part of an elite team.
[00:48:43.946 --> 00:48:45.728]  You got responsibilities now.
[00:48:47.569 --> 00:48:49.671]  Now get out there and start spying.
[00:49:00.026 --> 00:49:03.788]  Can we have a large house blend, please?
[00:49:03.868 --> 00:49:05.268]  Alright, let me get that for you.
[00:49:05.628 --> 00:49:07.729]  Oh yeah, he's definitely one.
[00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:17.412]  Listen, um, are you... Why are you paying cash, huh?
[00:49:17.432 --> 00:49:18.473]  Yeah, you alright, man?
[00:49:20.469 --> 00:49:21.190]  I gotta ask you this.
[00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:22.631]  It's just a matter of national security.
[00:49:23.072 --> 00:49:24.073]  I'm an important person now.
[00:49:24.953 --> 00:49:26.255]  Is there a reason you're paying with cash?
[00:49:27.536 --> 00:49:28.977]  It's only a couple dollars.
[00:49:29.058 --> 00:49:34.163]  I just usually pay cash when it's, you know, not very much money.
[00:49:34.423 --> 00:49:34.663]  Why?
[00:49:36.785 --> 00:49:38.627]  I don't understand how that's any of your business.
[00:49:39.428 --> 00:49:41.670]  But I mean, privacy is not what America's about.
[00:49:43.197 --> 00:49:44.938]  I've got to report you to Homeland Security.
[00:49:45.758 --> 00:49:46.559]  Are you on meds?
[00:49:47.399 --> 00:49:48.680]  No, this is the new Homeland.
[00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:54.483]  I mean, the TSA sticks their hands down your pants, I mean... I don't know, you just think you're acting kind of weird.
[00:49:54.803 --> 00:49:55.964]  I just want a cup of coffee.
[00:49:55.984 --> 00:50:00.326]  Alright, yeah, and with the inflation, it's actually $5 for a cup of coffee.
[00:50:00.346 --> 00:50:01.627]  Do you have some more money?
[00:50:03.207 --> 00:50:04.528]  Can I get a cup of coffee?
[00:50:04.548 --> 00:50:06.489]  Just regular?
[00:50:07.049 --> 00:50:07.289]  Sure.
[00:50:07.309 --> 00:50:07.570]  Medium?
[00:50:07.610 --> 00:50:08.050]  Anything else?
[00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:09.991]  I'll get a cookie, too.
[00:50:10.271 --> 00:50:10.991]  You'll get a cookie?
[00:50:11.071 --> 00:50:12.032]  Alright, sure, I'll get that for you.
[00:50:14.093 --> 00:50:15.433]  God, there's a lot of terrorists.
[00:50:16.114 --> 00:50:16.814]  Hold on a minute.
[00:50:16.854 --> 00:50:17.934]  Can you pay with a credit card, please?
[00:50:17.954 --> 00:50:22.335]  I don't know if I have enough in my account, so I'm just going to pay cash.
[00:50:22.375 --> 00:50:25.256]  Actually, I have a couple 20s here, so I'm just going to give you a 20.
[00:50:25.296 --> 00:50:26.716]  Is that cool?
[00:50:27.136 --> 00:50:28.617]  Oh, my God!
[00:50:29.077 --> 00:50:34.418]  I got to get my stuff together.
[00:50:34.578 --> 00:50:35.858]  I'm Jack Bauer, Jack Bauer.
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:41.420]  Can you get my check?
[00:50:43.916 --> 00:50:44.357]  Can I have that?
[00:50:44.417 --> 00:50:44.657]  Thanks.
[00:50:46.019 --> 00:50:46.299]  You cool?
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:47.581]  You're being watched.
[00:50:47.601 --> 00:50:49.003]  The homeland's keeping you safe.
[00:50:49.083 --> 00:50:50.084]  By who?
[00:50:50.925 --> 00:50:51.446]  Just get out of here.
[00:50:51.466 --> 00:50:51.847]  You're lucky.
[00:50:53.128 --> 00:50:58.535]  You know, it's a pretty big boost to my ego to realize I'm a good guy because I spy on everybody.
[00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:07.309]  There he is.
[00:51:07.409 --> 00:51:08.049]  Oh, he's dangerous.
[00:51:08.069 --> 00:51:08.510]  You can tell him.
[00:51:08.970 --> 00:51:10.811]  I just act like I'm sneaking up on him.
[00:51:11.091 --> 00:51:11.612]  All right.
[00:51:12.052 --> 00:51:12.172]  Oh.
[00:51:12.612 --> 00:51:13.433]  Oh, no, it's true.
[00:51:13.473 --> 00:51:14.894]  He's looking at InfoWars.
[00:51:15.274 --> 00:51:19.357]  In fact, it says in the report that they visit extremists or radical sites.
[00:51:19.877 --> 00:51:20.637]  I gotta track him.
[00:51:20.858 --> 00:51:21.918]  I gotta do what they told me.
[00:51:22.799 --> 00:51:24.460]  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:25.621]  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[00:51:25.901 --> 00:51:26.941]  I can almost hear it now.
[00:51:27.282 --> 00:51:28.662]  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[00:51:28.963 --> 00:51:29.943]  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[00:51:30.143 --> 00:51:31.204]  Oh, my gosh, some secret agent.
[00:51:31.404 --> 00:51:32.465]  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[00:51:32.665 --> 00:51:33.646]  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[00:51:41.065 --> 00:51:49.169]  Oh man, I'm brave.
[00:51:49.189 --> 00:51:50.729]  I'm just like those guys on TV.
[00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:53.170]  Yes, yes, FBI.
[00:51:53.531 --> 00:51:53.971]  I've got him.
[00:51:54.451 --> 00:51:54.891]  I've got him.
[00:51:55.411 --> 00:52:01.014]  He bought coffee with cash and he was using a proxy server to search the web.
[00:52:01.934 --> 00:52:02.175]  Yes.
[00:52:02.955 --> 00:52:03.775]  Yes, I've got one of them.
[00:52:03.795 --> 00:52:04.756]  He's definitely a terrorist.
[00:52:08.851 --> 00:52:12.793]  The dramatization that you just witnessed is absurd.
[00:52:13.834 --> 00:52:19.658]  And it's even more absurd because it reflects reality in this country and worldwide today.
[00:52:20.458 --> 00:52:24.861]  We are 10 years into the biggest hoax in human history.
[00:52:25.441 --> 00:52:27.182]  The threat of terrorism.
[00:52:27.602 --> 00:52:30.184]  It is an irrational fear.
[00:52:30.304 --> 00:52:35.347]  It is a psychological compulsion that's been engineered into people.
[00:52:35.607 --> 00:52:36.688]  Either you are with us,
[00:52:38.177 --> 00:52:39.358]  Or you are with the terrorists.
[00:52:39.438 --> 00:52:40.799]  Global terrorism.
[00:52:40.899 --> 00:52:41.639]  Terrorism.
[00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:42.260]  Terrorism.
[00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:42.780]  Terrorism.
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:43.701]  Evil terrorists.
[00:52:43.841 --> 00:52:44.061]  Terrorists.
[00:52:44.101 --> 00:52:44.341]  Terrorists.
[00:52:44.361 --> 00:52:44.582]  Terrorists.
[00:52:44.602 --> 00:52:44.822]  Terrorists.
[00:52:44.862 --> 00:52:45.082]  Terrorists.
[00:52:45.102 --> 00:52:45.342]  Terrorists.
[00:52:45.362 --> 00:52:45.582]  Terrorists.
[00:52:45.662 --> 00:52:45.882]  Terrorists.
[00:52:45.943 --> 00:52:46.383]  Terrorists.
[00:52:46.403 --> 00:52:48.364]  Al Qaeda is still a threat.
[00:52:48.484 --> 00:52:52.867]  Many Al Qaeda groups or Al Qaeda inspired groups.
[00:52:53.007 --> 00:52:54.108]  Homegrown threat.
[00:52:54.268 --> 00:52:55.269]  Terrorist threat.
[00:52:55.309 --> 00:52:56.750]  Attacking our homeland.
[00:52:56.930 --> 00:53:04.896]  When you really pull back from a non-emotional perspective and look at this through a historical lens, you see what a hoax it is.
[00:53:05.553 --> 00:53:10.835]  The only thing we have to fear is fear itself!
[00:53:11.115 --> 00:53:14.337]  Nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror!
[00:53:14.877 --> 00:53:29.763]  It is absurd, it is ridiculous that the land of the free, home of the brave is gripped in abject fear, groveling and begging for the government to take our rights, launch wars, engage in secret arrest.
[00:53:29.923 --> 00:53:33.785]  Trillions of dollars have been spent in the last decade on anti-terrorism.
[00:53:34.185 --> 00:53:38.030]  Our entire society is converting to a domestic police state.
[00:53:38.330 --> 00:53:39.511]  Drones in the skies.
[00:53:39.912 --> 00:53:42.154]  TSA sticking their hands down your pants.
[00:53:42.475 --> 00:53:45.538]  Putting you in ionizing radiation chambers.
[00:53:45.899 --> 00:53:47.040]  The naked body scanners.
[00:53:47.761 --> 00:53:50.784]  But the system knows that it's a fraud.
[00:53:51.385 --> 00:53:55.669]  The system itself is actually engaging in terrorism.
[00:53:55.849 --> 00:54:07.339]  The truth is, government and its corporate whore media is using this hyped-up threat to actually terrorize the population into giving up our basic liberties.
[00:54:07.699 --> 00:54:17.792]  And let's not forget that the former head of Homeland Security, Tom Ridge, a few years ago, even wrote a book admitting that they would issue terror alerts for political gain.
[00:54:18.173 --> 00:54:23.881]  Let's read the UN's own definition of terror that is very similar to the FBI's.
[00:54:25.216 --> 00:54:31.683]  Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public.
[00:54:32.184 --> 00:54:33.966]  There it is, hidden in plain view.
[00:54:34.547 --> 00:54:44.558]  Governments are saying, give up your rights, give us unlimited power and taxation, get behind all these wars for empire, or terrorists are going to get you.
[00:54:45.479 --> 00:54:50.182]  That itself is the very definition of terrorism.
[00:54:50.202 --> 00:54:52.363]  Now I'm going to go through some of these statistics.
[00:54:52.543 --> 00:55:00.187]  You've got a better chance of dying from a honeybee sting or falling down in your shower than you do of being killed by a terrorist.
[00:55:00.627 --> 00:55:03.989]  You have a much better chance of dying water skiing
[00:55:04.449 --> 00:55:13.074]  Or swimming in your pool, or slipping in your bathtub, or a deer jumping out in front of you, and having a car wreck and dying, than you do from terrorists.
[00:55:13.334 --> 00:55:14.314]  The numbers are all there.
[00:55:14.654 --> 00:55:19.757]  Even Scientific American, a few years ago, did a big breakdown on this.
[00:55:20.057 --> 00:55:21.058]  Let's just look at the numbers.
[00:55:21.698 --> 00:55:28.182]  You've got a 1 in 540 chance each and every year of developing fatal cancer.
[00:55:28.742 --> 00:55:36.126]  If you look at the wars launched in the name of fighting terrorists, in the case of Iraq, the Iraqis had a 1 in 1,150 chance of dying.
[00:55:38.928 --> 00:55:40.288]  Let's look at traffic accidents.
[00:55:40.728 --> 00:55:45.610]  In the year 2008, you had a 1 in 8,000 chance of dying in a car wreck.
[00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:47.470]  Homicide in the United States.
[00:55:47.890 --> 00:55:51.311]  You had a 1 in 22,000 times chance of dying.
[00:55:51.611 --> 00:55:53.772]  Let's take terrorism in Northern Ireland.
[00:55:54.112 --> 00:55:56.933]  During that entire conflict from 1970 to 2007, you had a 1 in 43,000 chance of being killed.
[00:56:02.794 --> 00:56:15.743]  If you take all terrorism in the United States from 1970 to 2007, you had a 1 in 3.5 million chance of being killed by a terrorist.
[00:56:16.283 --> 00:56:22.548]  And remember, many of those terrorist attacks were actually staged or provocateured to take your freedom.
[00:56:23.268 --> 00:56:26.449]  We're not just going to show you the fake threat of terror.
[00:56:27.070 --> 00:56:30.671]  We're going to show you the real threats to human society.
[00:56:31.192 --> 00:56:39.375]  And we're going to expose the number one killer of human beings in the last 100 years.
[00:56:40.115 --> 00:56:45.778]  This information that you're about to see could save billions of lives.
[00:56:46.478 --> 00:56:47.759]  And in every case,
[00:56:48.888 --> 00:56:57.075]  These threats flow from the global technocratic elite and their scientific dictatorship.
[00:56:59.777 --> 00:57:02.620]  And it's not just that the elite are a threat to the general public.
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:05.562]  I've analyzed this thing from one end to the other.
[00:57:06.203 --> 00:57:08.264]  They're the greatest threat to themselves.
[00:57:09.141 --> 00:57:12.502]  But wasn't that the case with Hitler turning East into Russia?
[00:57:13.262 --> 00:57:14.023]  Or Napoleon?
[00:57:14.423 --> 00:57:15.643]  Or even Julius Caesar?
[00:57:16.464 --> 00:57:23.546]  It's the fact that they're so arrogant, so filled with bravada and chutzpah, that they think they're God.
[00:57:24.626 --> 00:57:32.589]  These control freaks are going to bring themselves down, and all the rest of us with them, if we don't wake up and stop them.
[00:57:33.609 --> 00:57:37.951]  Of all the real proven threats to humanity, none of them
[00:57:39.335 --> 00:57:42.877]  ...have killed as many people as government itself.
[00:57:43.577 --> 00:57:46.679]  In academia, it's known as democide.
[00:57:47.459 --> 00:57:51.442]  But notice, you've probably never heard that, even if you went to college.
[00:57:52.122 --> 00:57:55.444]  And you've certainly never seen it on the news, or on the Discovery Channel.
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:04.343]  Oh no, they're too busy telling you about sharks they're gonna get you any minute with Shark Week and Bin Laden and we gotta stick our hands down your pants.
[00:58:05.043 --> 00:58:15.887]  No, you never hear about Demosite and it's proven, it's on record, that governments have killed over 260 million people.
[00:58:16.187 --> 00:58:17.467]  It's a giant number.
[00:58:18.328 --> 00:58:21.129]  So big that it's even hard to grasp.
[00:58:22.028 --> 00:58:29.475]  That is the number one cause of unnatural death in the 20th and now 21st century.
[00:58:29.735 --> 00:58:34.479]  And if you look back at the eons before that, it was always number one.
[00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:36.802]  Look what George Washington and many others said.
[00:58:37.863 --> 00:58:39.764]  Government is like fire.
[00:58:40.125 --> 00:58:43.287]  It is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.
[00:58:44.028 --> 00:58:47.610]  You bet it is.
[00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:49.952]  260 plus million dead.
[00:58:50.672 --> 00:58:51.572]  Demoscite.
[00:58:52.313 --> 00:58:54.114]  When your government kills you.
[00:58:54.714 --> 00:59:04.480]  To put Demoscite into perspective, it would take 10 sports stadiums, jam-packed with 100,000 people apiece, to represent 1 million souls.
[00:59:05.201 --> 00:59:06.181]  China, from 1949 to 1987,
[00:59:09.443 --> 00:59:13.709]  The Communist Party killed 76 plus million people.
[00:59:14.269 --> 00:59:15.291]  And they even admit it.
[00:59:15.631 --> 00:59:16.352]  They're proud of it.
[00:59:16.913 --> 00:59:18.535]  The USSR, from 1917 to 1987, killed over 61 million people.
[00:59:25.223 --> 00:59:30.887]  Combined Western colonialism killed over 50 million people.
[00:59:31.688 --> 00:59:41.835]  Germany under Hitler from 1933 to 1945 killed more than 20 million people total, including their own population.
[00:59:42.535 --> 00:59:49.979]  Japan, during its imperial orgy from 1936 to 1945, killed five plus million people.
[00:59:50.319 --> 00:59:57.043]  Before Mao even got into power from 1923 to 1948, they killed right around three and a half million.
[00:59:57.383 --> 01:00:01.185]  And good old Pol Pot in Cambodia, funded by the U.S.
[01:00:01.225 --> 01:00:04.427]  government and Zbigniew Brzezinski, from 1975 to 1979, killed around 30% of his population.
[01:00:04.447 --> 01:00:04.947]  Two million.
[01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:13.673]  Turkey during their genocide of the Armenians, 1.8 million.
[01:00:13.713 --> 01:00:14.254]  Vietnam, 1.67 million.
[01:00:14.434 --> 01:00:15.475]  Poland, 1.585 million.
[01:00:15.515 --> 01:00:16.816]  Pakistan, 1.5 plus million.
[01:00:16.836 --> 01:00:19.058]  Yugoslavia under Tito, 1,072,000.
[01:00:19.318 --> 01:00:20.419]  And the mega murder just continues.
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:21.640]  North Korea, 1.663 million.
[01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:22.181]  Mexico,
[01:00:35.693 --> 01:00:41.295]  1,417,000.
[01:00:36.273 --> 01:00:41.295]  Russia, before the Communists even got in, killed over 1,000,000.
[01:00:42.475 --> 01:00:45.456]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[01:00:45.936 --> 01:00:48.597]  For a whopping conservative total of 262,000,000.
[01:00:52.358 --> 01:00:54.618]  Governments winning the war against humanity.
[01:00:55.279 --> 01:00:56.399]  And let me just be clear.
[01:00:57.386 --> 01:01:00.027]  That's governments killing unarmed civilians.
[01:01:00.567 --> 01:01:02.969]  That doesn't even count military.
[01:01:03.189 --> 01:01:07.791]  If you add those in, it's well over 350 million.
[01:01:08.491 --> 01:01:20.757]  So, democide, or death by government, is the number one threat, because it's already been carried out many, many times, and governments all over the world are engaging in mass murder right now.
[01:01:21.337 --> 01:01:27.464]  And our own government, under the National Defense Authorization Act, is openly stating that they will kill U.S.
[01:01:27.504 --> 01:01:29.946]  citizens, secretly arrest U.S.
[01:01:29.986 --> 01:01:34.231]  citizens, and have us disappear into secret prisons and black holes.
[01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:37.754]  So the gauntlet has been thrown down in front of us.
[01:01:38.555 --> 01:01:42.599]  You've seen how governments have overtly killed their populations.
[01:01:43.697 --> 01:01:46.921]  By the sword, by the gun, by starvation.
[01:01:47.662 --> 01:01:50.986]  But what about covert forms of genocide?
[01:01:51.666 --> 01:01:53.789]  We're now going to look at that area.
[01:01:54.530 --> 01:02:02.519]  And then I'll get into the mad scientist activity of the global rulers who are trying to basically become God.
[01:02:03.527 --> 01:02:05.728]  Throughout history, there have been two major movements.
[01:02:06.388 --> 01:02:15.692]  Those that are promoting and pushing for human liberty, and for empowering humanity, and those that seek to dominate and control it.
[01:02:16.712 --> 01:02:23.114]  Now, a pseudoscience developed around 1850, in the United Kingdom, called eugenics.
[01:02:23.875 --> 01:02:28.497]  And the spin-off of that, of course, was the Nazis and their race purification program.
[01:02:29.397 --> 01:02:31.918]  But eugenics was funded by the British royal family,
[01:02:32.518 --> 01:02:37.782]  And was basically just a regurgitation of what royalty had already believed for thousands of years.
[01:02:38.183 --> 01:02:40.144]  That they were divine.
[01:02:40.604 --> 01:02:43.146]  That they had a divine right of kings.
[01:02:43.707 --> 01:02:48.451]  And that they had a right to enslave, dominate, and kill populations.
[01:02:50.319 --> 01:02:58.941]  As liberty grew worldwide, governments began to develop covert means to control populations and to exterminate them.
[01:02:59.381 --> 01:03:06.523]  And that's what many famous eugenicists, including Nobel Prize winners, have written about and talked about, like Bertrand Russell.
[01:03:07.483 --> 01:03:18.806]  Diet injections and injunctions will combine, from a very early age, to produce the sort of character and the sort of beliefs that the authorities consider desirable.
[01:03:19.784 --> 01:03:24.869]  And any serious criticism of the powers that be will become psychologically impossible.
[01:03:25.449 --> 01:03:26.270]  Bertrand Russell.
[01:03:27.551 --> 01:03:38.742]  You can go back to the 1920s and 30s and they obsess on putting chemicals in our food, in our water to make us less aggressive, more docile, to dumb us down so we will submit.
[01:03:39.122 --> 01:03:44.467]  What's so frustrating about these covert programs at population reduction is that they're not really covert.
[01:03:45.268 --> 01:03:49.413]  Sure, it's not on the nightly news, but it's all hidden in plain view.
[01:03:49.954 --> 01:04:02.069]  You know about the experimentation on black men, injecting them with syphilis, and Tuskegee experiment, and plague bomb test off the coast of Scotland, and all of England being sprayed with biologicals.
[01:04:02.629 --> 01:04:06.253]  Or Henry Kissinger in the 1970s putting out U.S.
[01:04:06.313 --> 01:04:14.782]  policy State Department Memorandum 200 that called for using food and war as a weapon to reduce populations in the third world.
[01:04:15.323 --> 01:04:17.084]  It is so diabolical.
[01:04:17.725 --> 01:04:24.689]  This corporatist world government is built and based on reducing population.
[01:04:25.309 --> 01:04:28.391]  And it's in the British Population Commission documents of 1949.
[01:04:28.431 --> 01:04:41.218]  White House science czar John P. Holdren wrote in the 1970s that they should develop covert chemicals in the water to reduce fertility and the population.
[01:04:41.418 --> 01:04:42.139]  It's amazing.
[01:04:42.479 --> 01:04:46.021]  They admit that they're establishing a global corporate government
[01:04:46.741 --> 01:04:56.642]  To carry out genocide covertly, through vaccines, through sodium fluoride, through sterilants like bisphenol A, aspartame.
[01:04:57.930 --> 01:04:59.090]  The list goes on and on.
[01:04:59.551 --> 01:05:05.133]  It is all meant to poison and debilitate and reduce our fertility.
[01:05:05.613 --> 01:05:07.934]  That's why cancer rates have skyrocketed.
[01:05:08.294 --> 01:05:13.375]  That's why the United States has the highest rate of cancer, diabetes, neurological disorders.
[01:05:13.495 --> 01:05:16.537]  It's all being beta tested here.
[01:05:17.477 --> 01:05:25.760]  World government is being established as a straitjacket on the planet so the globalists can carry out genocide.
[01:05:26.638 --> 01:05:28.519]  And it's not fair to call them Nazis.
[01:05:29.379 --> 01:05:33.301]  The Nazis just moved too quickly and were exposed.
[01:05:34.101 --> 01:05:37.383]  It's not fair to call them Nazis, because they're worse than Nazis.
[01:05:37.983 --> 01:05:49.968]  They are the progenitors of the Nazi idea, but they're patient, they're calm, they pose as philanthropists, but they can't control themselves sometimes.
[01:05:50.368 --> 01:05:54.730]  That's why Bill Gates, whose father was the head of Planned Parenthood and a known eugenicist,
[01:05:55.330 --> 01:05:57.472]  Has admitted he wants to reduce population.
[01:05:57.873 --> 01:06:00.475]  And that's what his foundation is really all about.
[01:06:00.936 --> 01:06:04.660]  He's bragged about get rid of a grandma and hire 10 teachers.
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:08.684]  He's spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient.
[01:06:09.345 --> 01:06:11.187]  Would it be better not to lay off?
[01:06:11.914 --> 01:06:25.550]  He's come out and said, give people vaccines to reduce population.
[01:06:25.890 --> 01:06:28.853]  You've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero.
[01:06:29.194 --> 01:06:32.137]  Probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.
[01:06:33.118 --> 01:06:36.924]  Now that's back from high school algebra, but let's take a look.
[01:06:38.005 --> 01:06:39.467]  First we've got population.
[01:06:40.088 --> 01:06:48.461]  Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[01:06:49.582 --> 01:06:57.124]  It is so incredibly disgusting, and he's now the number one funder of GMO crops being developed across the world.
[01:06:57.684 --> 01:07:15.689]  And in every study that's been done of GMO crops across the board, they massively reduce fertility in the first generation of rats and guinea pigs, and other rodents like rabbits, and within three generations, near total sterility and bizarre deformities
[01:07:16.269 --> 01:07:21.872]  Shriveled sexual organs, hair growing in the mouth, it is beyond bizarre.
[01:07:22.193 --> 01:07:28.416]  Those that ate the genetically engineered toy, they didn't actually show the problems in the first generation.
[01:07:29.117 --> 01:07:36.161]  The second generation was slower growth, slower onset for maturity, but by the third generation, that's when the boom was, the boom hit.
[01:07:36.201 --> 01:07:41.324]  And that was when nearly all of the adults had lost the ability to have babies.
[01:07:42.381 --> 01:07:57.566]  When we look at Monsanto, that Bill Gates is the major owner of, the same folks that gave us Agent Orange and you name it, and we learn that in their own cafeteria, in their own restaurants and cantinas, there is no GMO.
[01:07:58.426 --> 01:08:09.950]  And then we learn Bill Gates and the Rockefeller Foundation are building underground seed vaults of uninfected non-GMO seeds all over the world, at the Arctic Circle and other areas.
[01:08:10.350 --> 01:08:15.192]  They are obsessed with giant farms that produce all the food they eat.
[01:08:15.632 --> 01:08:17.713]  The cattle are only fed organics.
[01:08:18.914 --> 01:08:25.837]  That is then shipped around the world, no matter where they go, their own private chefs prepare their food.
[01:08:26.752 --> 01:08:27.493]  But it gets worse.
[01:08:28.154 --> 01:08:37.366]  Monsanto, who's gotten their people in all the regulatory positions, is coming out with new federal regs that you can't even be told when you're being fed GMO.
[01:08:37.747 --> 01:08:41.472]  It's designed to sterilize you and basically give you organ failure and cancer.
[01:08:41.752 --> 01:08:43.855]  So, they won't eat it in their own...
[01:08:44.736 --> 01:08:47.259]  Monsanto restaurants at their facilities.
[01:08:47.899 --> 01:08:48.940]  And Bill Gates won't eat it.
[01:08:49.281 --> 01:08:51.983]  And the Queen of England, who's a known eugenicist, won't eat it.
[01:08:52.244 --> 01:08:55.707]  And Prince Philip, who says he wants 80% of you dead, he won't eat it.
[01:08:56.488 --> 01:09:05.597]  If I were reincarnated, I would wish to be returned to this Earth as a killer virus to lower human population levels.
[01:09:06.218 --> 01:09:07.018]  Prince Philip.
[01:09:07.759 --> 01:09:18.482]  The Queen of England is obsessed with organic raw milk, but in the United States and Canada and England, they're persecuting Amish and others that are producing it and selling it to their neighbors.
[01:09:18.802 --> 01:09:28.905]  And the Communist Chinese leadership, who publicly signed on to a eugenics program with the globalists to reduce their population in exchange for development.
[01:09:29.628 --> 01:09:40.597]  Their inner party chiefs are obsessed on record with nothing but pure organic food while they force GMO on their population.
[01:09:41.198 --> 01:09:44.681]  It is all about sterilizing the population and giving
[01:09:44.701 --> 01:09:50.145]  There are so many other examples of the elite poisoning us while doing everything they can to avoid their own garbage.
[01:09:50.725 --> 01:09:54.268]  But I'll give you just one more example here, and that's Germany.
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.062]  And of course this is going on all over the world.
[01:10:13.422 --> 01:10:21.752]  It came out a few years ago that the German government and the top military brass were refusing to take the H1N1 shot.
[01:10:22.213 --> 01:10:27.359]  So Big Pharma produced a quote clean or safe vaccine for them.
[01:10:28.274 --> 01:10:39.797]  And of course it did come out that the H1N1 vaccines did have other RNA added to it and other viruses and basically was just a Trojan horse for population reduction.
[01:10:40.297 --> 01:10:46.859]  And there have now been many other vaccine trials that have come out that are actually killing homeless people in the test and even newborn children.
[01:10:47.319 --> 01:10:53.927]  I saw reports a decade ago where the CDC had a secret meeting and Congress demanded the documents.
[01:10:53.947 --> 01:10:54.928]  That's why we now have them.
[01:10:55.388 --> 01:11:00.113]  And the leadership of the CDC was saying, tell your families don't take the vaccines.
[01:11:00.454 --> 01:11:03.657]  It's causing brain damage, but don't tell the public.
[01:11:04.258 --> 01:11:10.224]  They learned when Hitler had guys in black uniforms out there shooting people in pits, that was a little too obvious.
[01:11:10.824 --> 01:11:17.971]  Now they just soft kill you, and then you go to one of these big Rockefeller-controlled hospitals, and they suck all your savings out of you.
[01:11:18.091 --> 01:11:23.116]  And the globalists have even told us, diet, injections, and injunctions will bring us
[01:11:24.016 --> 01:11:25.397]  Under the heel of the globalist.
[01:11:26.138 --> 01:11:27.739]  Our species is incredible.
[01:11:27.779 --> 01:11:36.866]  We're dynamic creatures that created space travel, and classical music, and literature, and poetry, and film.
[01:11:37.486 --> 01:11:49.455]  And these globalist psycho dirtbags now control the media and teach us how bad children are, how pathetic we are, how we're scum, how we have no heroes, how there's no good guys.
[01:11:49.736 --> 01:11:52.518]  So we'll just roll over and give the world to them.
[01:11:52.978 --> 01:11:54.239]  It's truly disgusting.
[01:11:54.859 --> 01:12:11.110]  The ultimate power trip by Ted Turner, Bill Gates, David Rockefeller, people like George Soros, Oprah Winfrey, meeting in secret in New York to talk about ways to forcibly reduce population.
[01:12:12.111 --> 01:12:14.953]  And then when the article did leak out, they tried to have it suppressed.
[01:12:16.286 --> 01:12:19.689]  That much money, that much power around one table.
[01:12:20.069 --> 01:12:22.391]  It begs the question, what were they doing?
[01:12:22.591 --> 01:12:23.932]  What were they scheming?
[01:12:24.252 --> 01:12:25.633]  Total world domination?
[01:12:26.054 --> 01:12:29.737]  This group, together for six hours, was talking about charity.
[01:12:30.237 --> 01:12:33.059]  Education, emergency relief, global health.
[01:12:33.239 --> 01:12:41.506]  The very people that talk about how they want to kill us all day, run the global programs to make sure our kids get extra vaccines and eat GMO.
[01:12:42.975 --> 01:12:44.456]  It doesn't get any more obvious.
[01:12:44.776 --> 01:12:46.218]  This isn't 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[01:12:47.278 --> 01:12:48.780]  This is 1 plus 1 equals 2.
[01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:52.643]  This is so ridiculously obvious.
[01:12:53.283 --> 01:13:01.309]  It was the eugenicist, population reductionist Adolf Hitler who said, the bigger the lie, the more people will believe it.
[01:13:02.350 --> 01:13:05.012]  And when I first read that as a teenager, I didn't understand it.
[01:13:05.032 --> 01:13:08.235]  But as I've learned more, I realize how true that is.
[01:13:09.019 --> 01:13:24.238]  Once you tell a giant lie from a position of authority, like David Rockefeller, or Ted Turner, or Bill Gates, and once the politicians and the general public go along with your lie, they've now all signed on to it, and they give power to the lie.
[01:13:24.439 --> 01:13:26.862]  Is there a connection with autism, for example?
[01:13:27.435 --> 01:13:31.736]  Well, Dr. Wakefield has been shown to use absolutely fraudulent data.
[01:13:32.136 --> 01:13:34.597]  He had a financial interest in some lawsuits.
[01:13:34.637 --> 01:13:36.237]  He created a fake paper.
[01:13:36.337 --> 01:13:37.598]  The journal allowed it to run.
[01:13:38.598 --> 01:13:43.659]  All the other studies were done, showed no connection whatsoever, again and again and again.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.161]  And so it's an absolute lie that has killed thousands of
[01:13:49.561 --> 01:14:02.877]  And it's then very hard to reverse that lie because it's got so much momentum and such a great weight because the public is taught that if they ever stand up to the lie, it'll bring down the whole house of cards.
[01:14:03.978 --> 01:14:06.481]  My friends, we need to bring down this house of cards.
[01:14:07.122 --> 01:14:09.145]  If it doesn't come down, we're ruined.
[01:14:09.969 --> 01:14:11.731]  Most of us are already walking dead.
[01:14:12.231 --> 01:14:14.833]  We were born being fed deadly fluoride.
[01:14:14.874 --> 01:14:16.115]  We had our IQs reduced.
[01:14:16.135 --> 01:14:18.357]  We were shot up with dangerous vaccines.
[01:14:18.677 --> 01:14:19.898]  We've been fed GMO.
[01:14:20.298 --> 01:14:30.528]  It's almost impossible to stay away from it, unless you're some billionaire who has their own private farms and ranches and private chefs that fly around behind you, preparing your meals.
[01:14:32.312 --> 01:14:35.755]  The only way to defeat these people is to realize it is a big lie.
[01:14:36.316 --> 01:14:37.397]  It is a giant hoax.
[01:14:37.777 --> 01:14:40.340]  And to read their own arrogant statements.
[01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:51.550]  If a black death could be spread throughout the world, once in every generation, survivors could procreate freely without making the world too full.
[01:14:52.271 --> 01:14:53.172]  Bertrand Russell.
[01:14:54.073 --> 01:14:56.315]  Talk about sick control freaks.
[01:14:57.435 --> 01:15:07.245]  Who hate humanity so much that they spend their every waking minute trying to think of ways to set up a global government so they can exterminate us and our families.
[01:15:08.006 --> 01:15:08.947]  My God!
[01:15:09.388 --> 01:15:17.977]  And their plan is so horrific, they think we're too weak-minded to face what they've admittedly been caught doing and to resist them.
[01:15:19.292 --> 01:15:21.313]  Are you pathetic scum that deserves to die?
[01:15:21.333 --> 01:15:23.234]  Are you going to prove them right?
[01:15:24.074 --> 01:15:24.755]  It's up to you.
[01:15:25.295 --> 01:15:29.937]  The globalists have been so arrogant that they've not even hidden any of their designs.
[01:15:30.838 --> 01:15:35.520]  They think that it's so horrific that we'll just let them get away with what they're doing.
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:38.541]  Are we smart enough to learn from history?
[01:15:38.821 --> 01:15:42.963]  Government is the number one cause of unnatural death throughout all of human history.
[01:15:43.564 --> 01:15:48.086]  Government tends to be taken over by psychopaths who are completely ruthless.
[01:15:48.993 --> 01:15:57.723]  Good people tend to stand down and let the psychopaths do whatever they want to them simply because they are the authorities.
[01:16:00.011 --> 01:16:06.713]  But the technocratic eugenics social engineers are not content to just soft-kill the population.
[01:16:07.573 --> 01:16:26.359]  All across the Western world, from Australia to the United States, government-funded universities have been developing Level 4 super-weaponized viruses and bacteria that kill over 90% of the mammals that come in contact with it.
[01:16:27.139 --> 01:16:31.560]  That's more than 9 out of 10 people on your street dead.
[01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:33.841]  Weaponized airborne Ebola.
[01:16:34.321 --> 01:16:38.362]  Weaponized airborne mousepox that can be designed for humans.
[01:16:38.862 --> 01:16:41.603]  Weaponized airborne smallpox.
[01:16:42.043 --> 01:16:44.264]  Weaponized airborne bird flu.
[01:16:45.044 --> 01:16:47.105]  Weaponized airborne H1N1.
[01:16:47.525 --> 01:16:55.447]  Our own government dug up dead whalers who died of the Spanish flu that killed more than 40 million people.
[01:16:56.260 --> 01:17:00.823]  And they've dug up the original bubonic plague and replicated it.
[01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:06.627]  They've taken every disease ever seen in history and souped it up.
[01:17:07.347 --> 01:17:19.856]  And they're now developing massive storehouses of these weapons in the name of bio-defense under the BioShield program and storing them in level 1, 2, and 3 facilities.
[01:17:22.264 --> 01:17:23.585]  Let me put this in layman terms.
[01:17:24.526 --> 01:17:42.866]  A level four bioweapons lab should be three floors under the ground, barbed wire fences, minefields, and machine guns, and a system that if the super germs get out, they pull a lever, alarms go off, and the whole place goes up in flames.
[01:17:43.885 --> 01:17:56.296]  But instead, the global elite are storing it in Level 2 facilities, like the University of Texas at Galveston, behind a glass door with a swipe guard, right there in Petri dishes.
[01:17:57.137 --> 01:18:04.063]  And they're doing this so that when they release it to massively reduce population, they can claim it was an accident.
[01:18:04.924 --> 01:18:19.497]  This is one of the biggest threats we face is the fact that these eugenicists that run our governments have produced literally hundreds of super weapons and are just waiting until they've got their police state grid in place to release them.
[01:18:20.455 --> 01:18:25.937]  There are countless other examples of government weapons programs that endanger our planet.
[01:18:26.477 --> 01:18:28.038]  You know about nuclear weapons.
[01:18:28.098 --> 01:18:34.741]  You know about systems that kill all the life but leave the buildings in place, like the neutron bomb.
[01:18:35.321 --> 01:18:42.544]  But then, of course, there's also race-specific bioweapons that people like Dick Cheney talked about in the PNAG documents.
[01:18:43.564 --> 01:18:49.007]  Weapons that kill certain racial types and leave everyone else alive.
[01:18:50.027 --> 01:18:54.950]  In fact, it's possible that a weapon could be released and only Asians would live.
[01:18:55.270 --> 01:19:01.634]  Or a weapon could be released and only people of Northern European derivation would survive.
[01:19:02.134 --> 01:19:10.159]  Or weapons could be released where only people of Semitic background are killed, or people of Semitic background survive.
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:13.862]  These systems have been developed and are on record.
[01:19:14.482 --> 01:19:17.184]  But getting back into nuclear weapons,
[01:19:18.257 --> 01:19:26.503]  The Air Force has admitted they've been testing and trying to develop things like antimatter bombs that could actually destroy the entire planet.
[01:19:27.103 --> 01:19:40.692]  And yes, scientists at CERN have come out and said, well, there's a low probability that we'll create a black hole that destroys the Earth, or a strangelet, or a particle that sinks to the center of the Earth and then causes the planet to implode.
[01:19:41.833 --> 01:19:42.794]  My problem is this.
[01:19:44.073 --> 01:19:46.636]  The globalists have shown that they think they're God, but they're not.
[01:19:46.716 --> 01:20:03.256]  They're very reckless, they're full of bravado and chutzpah, and we now have hundreds of nuclear reactors in the world that are close to 40 years old or older, which are now literally rotting, and 9 out of 10 reactors are now reportedly leaking radiation.
[01:20:03.937 --> 01:20:04.457]  Now I am become death.
[01:20:34.046 --> 01:20:35.182]  The Destroyer of Worlds.
[01:20:42.844 --> 01:20:46.725]  And in their own words said, we have become Shiva, the destroyer.
[01:20:47.126 --> 01:20:49.346]  We have become Kali, the god of death.
[01:20:49.887 --> 01:20:54.068]  We are going to take on these powers even if it destroys us.
[01:20:54.448 --> 01:21:05.713]  A few decades later, the United States had tested more than a hundred high-power hydrogen bombs in the upper atmosphere and in the Van Allen radiation belt.
[01:21:06.953 --> 01:21:10.674]  The Air Force wanted to see if they could blow up the atmosphere.
[01:21:11.535 --> 01:21:11.815]  Again,
[01:21:13.154 --> 01:21:17.900]  They tell us all they give up our liberties because somebody might detonate a car bomb.
[01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:27.971]  But meanwhile, they're firing hydrogen nuclear weapons into the upper atmosphere in an attempt, in their own words, to blow a hole in the atmosphere.
[01:21:28.892 --> 01:21:36.037]  I interviewed years ago the director of HAARP, and he admitted that they're able to ignite the atmosphere with this system.
[01:21:36.697 --> 01:21:42.080]  Our whole world has become a giant experiment by mad scientists.
[01:21:42.621 --> 01:21:45.162]  This presentation is only a small part of the evidence.
[01:21:45.743 --> 01:21:48.705]  Unfortunately, the facts are incontrovertible.
[01:21:49.795 --> 01:21:59.221]  We have a group of mad scientists who believe that they are supermen in a race separate from general humanity playing God.
[01:22:00.142 --> 01:22:04.204]  One reason the globalists are so arrogant is that they've got advanced technology.
[01:22:04.564 --> 01:22:06.986]  They've been suppressing what's been doled out to the public.
[01:22:07.086 --> 01:22:09.848]  So they think they can control all of these systems.
[01:22:11.644 --> 01:22:12.725]  None of this is new.
[01:22:13.465 --> 01:22:20.570]  If you go back to every ancient civilization, the elites believed that they were God and the general population was scum.
[01:22:21.752 --> 01:22:26.935]  And the longer a dynasty went, the more decadent and crazy it got.
[01:22:27.375 --> 01:22:31.137]  The more the elites began to believe that they were infallible in God.
[01:22:31.877 --> 01:22:38.621]  And it's this same incredible hubris that is endangering our civilization today.
[01:22:39.341 --> 01:22:41.943]  You have all these elite families interbreeding.
[01:22:42.711 --> 01:22:47.693]  With their aggressive genes, their psychopathic genes, their sociopathic genes.
[01:22:48.493 --> 01:23:01.437]  And then philosophers and scientists come along, like Thomas Malthus two hundred and something years ago in England, and says, oh let's bring back the plague, let's give people diseases, let's reduce population.
[01:23:02.057 --> 01:23:12.210]  And then you see every other major British scientist, and then German, Russian, US scientist, since then, who's into eugenics saying Malthus was right.
[01:23:12.751 --> 01:23:14.153]  Let's promote the plague.
[01:23:14.493 --> 01:23:16.215]  Let's kill the general public.
[01:23:16.235 --> 01:23:18.398]  And then you've got these inbred elites.
[01:23:19.534 --> 01:23:22.355]  We were into all this stuff going, absolutely, let's do it!
[01:23:22.855 --> 01:23:27.996]  And then you find out they're putting stuff in our vaccines, our food, our water.
[01:23:28.316 --> 01:23:35.258]  They're engineering Trojan horse genetic traits into food that are causing organ failure and sterility.
[01:23:35.858 --> 01:23:40.379]  And you realize that a bunch of crazy psychos are in control.
[01:23:40.679 --> 01:23:42.079]  But I'll tell you what's even crazier.
[01:23:42.899 --> 01:23:45.000]  These psychopaths aren't even in control.
[01:23:46.536 --> 01:23:55.920]  They are so arrogant and think they're so invincible that they've got thousands of laboratories splicing every plant and animal you can imagine.
[01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:59.001]  Monkeys that have got five or six other species.
[01:23:59.562 --> 01:24:01.102]  Fish that have got insects in them.
[01:24:01.462 --> 01:24:07.305]  You name it, it's just pell-mell, helter-skelter, petal-to-the-metal wild.
[01:24:09.062 --> 01:24:12.586]  If we don't turn this around, we face a nightmare scenario.
[01:24:12.947 --> 01:24:15.690]  The globalists are already trying to start World War III right now.
[01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:20.976]  They're funding tens of billions of dollars for 30,000 drones in the skies over America.
[01:24:21.737 --> 01:24:26.442]  They've got neighborhood watch groups now spying on their neighbors for their political speech.
[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:31.162]  It's getting more and more Twilight Zone by the minute.
[01:24:31.943 --> 01:24:34.445]  Let's rediscover the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:24:34.725 --> 01:24:37.308]  Let's rediscover common sense, basic liberty.
[01:24:37.808 --> 01:24:40.010]  Let's protect individual rights.
[01:24:40.931 --> 01:24:43.613]  Let's get the globalist controllers under control.
[01:24:44.855 --> 01:24:47.516]  Let's point out that they're a bunch of lunatics.
[01:24:48.076 --> 01:24:53.399]  Let's stop buying into their whole Madison Avenue, Wall Street, Hollywood false reality.
[01:24:53.699 --> 01:24:59.542]  Let's rise above their control paradigm and really see it for what it is and call it out.
[01:25:00.282 --> 01:25:04.384]  You can't fight this system from within anymore.
[01:25:05.084 --> 01:25:16.495]  You've got to realize this house of cards is already coming down and the only way to save our civilization, our species, our society, is to face just how dire our straits are.
[01:25:17.156 --> 01:25:21.460]  All I want is for our species to continue.
[01:25:22.001 --> 01:25:28.807]  All I want is prosperity for our progeny, our great-great-grandchildren, to be able to live in peace
[01:25:29.768 --> 01:25:40.694]  And explore space, and be successful, and look back on the trials and tribulations we went through as an example for the trials and tribulations they're gonna face.
[01:25:41.635 --> 01:25:49.660]  I mean, the level of corruption and flat-out demonic evil that we're putting up with is just ridiculous.
[01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:52.141]  We're at the crossroads, my friends.
[01:25:53.082 --> 01:25:58.465]  Our future, our destiny, our very existence is up to you.
