[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.782]  Aaron Dykes here with a quick update from InfoWars.com.
[00:00:07.063 --> 00:00:19.232]  You're about to see the full special report that we did investigating the stealth implementation of the United Nations Agenda 21 right here in the United States under the name of sustainable communities.
[00:00:19.312 --> 00:00:20.673]  So why is this important?
[00:00:20.913 --> 00:00:24.656]  To oppose Agenda 21 is to oppose the planned society.
[00:00:24.836 --> 00:00:27.678]  As the cartoon Plannedopolis tried to convince us.
[00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.821]  I'm looking forward to showing you around Plannedopolis today.
[00:00:31.442 --> 00:00:34.844]  Where we were told how great life would be under a centralized system.
[00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:36.265]  No, not meat.
[00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:37.526]  It's not your birthday.
[00:00:37.827 --> 00:00:42.530]  The Global Food Council are doing a really good job of keeping food production going.
[00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.251]  Directed by technology.
[00:00:44.351 --> 00:00:46.513]  Switch off brain and go to work.
[00:00:47.273 --> 00:00:50.796]  With this many people around, I'm glad there's a mega computer in charge.
[00:00:50.976 --> 00:00:55.219]  Despite the fact that our lives would be tightly controlled, including calorie restrictions.
[00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:57.641]  Have you got your calorie card open on your smartphone?
[00:00:58.092 --> 00:00:59.614]  Transportation restrictions.
[00:00:59.754 --> 00:01:02.278]  I registered your visit with Slick Travel Corp.
[00:01:02.318 --> 00:01:04.761]  the other day, so they've allotted you a journey time.
[00:01:04.862 --> 00:01:07.726]  People have asked, what's so bad about Agenda 21?
[00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:13.634]  The founders believed in the separation of powers, but the modern-day framers worked through the United Nations.
[00:01:14.019 --> 00:01:17.682]  I want you to think for a minute about the existing neighborhood and housing regulations people voluntarily sign up for
[00:01:43.615 --> 00:01:54.041]  When they move into different neighborhoods, how tall your grass can be, whether or not you can have a basketball court or a fishing boat or an RV in your front yard, or in many cases, even in your backyard.
[00:01:54.502 --> 00:01:58.344]  You've seen the news articles where people aren't allowed to grow gardens in many areas.
[00:01:58.844 --> 00:02:00.906]  That is nothing compared to what's coming.
[00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:04.328]  If you follow the cap and trade laws that they try to pass through Congress,
[00:02:04.688 --> 00:02:04.888]  Thank you.
[00:02:16.275 --> 00:02:19.616]  On top of the already existing burdensome regulations.
[00:02:19.996 --> 00:02:25.158]  They were going to have housing inspectors, new rules on what kind of light bulbs you can have, and on and on.
[00:02:25.198 --> 00:02:26.958]  It was this endless laundry list.
[00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.760]  That's the kind of thing we're seeing happening under sustainable development.
[00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.601]  It's not sustainable at all.
[00:02:34.061 --> 00:02:41.143]  I can give you dozens and dozens if not hundreds of quotes from leading globalists who say they want to destroy society.
[00:02:41.443 --> 00:02:53.978]  Mari Strong, one of the leading advocates for Agenda 21 and a speaker at the United Nations Rio Summit in 1992 said, isn't the only hope for the planet that the industrialized civilizations collapse?
[00:02:54.258 --> 00:02:56.981]  Isn't it our responsibility to bring that about?
[00:02:57.002 --> 00:02:58.964]  A number of these environmental groups
[00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:00.965]  Have said things to the same effect.
[00:03:01.266 --> 00:03:02.647]  They want to stop growth.
[00:03:02.707 --> 00:03:05.149]  That's what smart growth so called is all about.
[00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:06.990]  It's not about new developments.
[00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.873]  It's about controlling and steering where humanity is allowed to go.
[00:03:11.013 --> 00:03:14.495]  They say they don't want there to be another United States in the developing world.
[00:03:14.576 --> 00:03:17.738]  They don't want other countries to be brought up to our living standards.
[00:03:18.118 --> 00:03:35.852]  They want to lower the United States living standards to a third world area, greatly reduce the population across the globe and here at home, and have more and more say in your life, what you're allowed to do on your own land, because it's now going to be re-zoned under the sustainable development plans.
[00:03:36.153 --> 00:03:38.835]  And it's just like the things we've already seen in China.
[00:03:38.915 --> 00:03:42.598]  In fact, the workshop I was at in Elgin for these sustainable communities
[00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:51.282]  That's already going on in China and it's nightmarish.
[00:03:51.302 --> 00:04:00.647]  You've heard about the Foxconn factory workers who commit suicide to such an extent that they have to put up suicide nets so that their own workers can't escape their own lives.
[00:04:00.687 --> 00:04:02.048]  They're basically slaves.
[00:04:02.068 --> 00:04:03.168]  You can call it what you want.
[00:04:03.488 --> 00:04:06.350]  That's the kind of regulations they want to see here in the US as well.
[00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:20.817]  And we spoke to a number of people throughout the community as well as these local bureaucrats and some of them recognize that these kind of plans to contain humanity and tell you how big or what kind of house you can live in is a Chinese-style tyranny.
[00:04:21.197 --> 00:04:22.178]  Come home to America.
[00:04:22.298 --> 00:04:29.021]  Jenna21's a plan we've been signed on to with the United Nations where we give up our property rights and freedom and be forced to live in apartments no bigger than this square.
[00:04:29.041 --> 00:04:29.802]  What do you think about that?
[00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:31.410]  I think that's terrible.
[00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:40.334]  It sounds kind of like Chinese foreign policy or interior policy regarding their house and how they're controlling all aspects of your life.
[00:04:40.874 --> 00:04:44.716]  And furthermore, communist China really is the ultimate class system.
[00:04:44.796 --> 00:04:50.158]  We're trained to think of communism as a leveling, as an equalizing of everyone, but it's actually not.
[00:04:50.218 --> 00:04:52.159]  It's the ultimate insider scheme.
[00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.100]  Party bureaucrats who control that communist model
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.701]  They regulate all land.
[00:04:57.741 --> 00:05:02.082]  They have the final say in who's allowed to buy, sell, and use that land.
[00:05:02.522 --> 00:05:10.084]  And they take it from ordinary people and redistribute it in a nepotism to their friends, their family, other top regulators.
[00:05:10.524 --> 00:05:11.944]  That's the true class system.
[00:05:12.064 --> 00:05:16.685]  I just wanted to throw that in there and we'll go now to that full Agenda 21 report.
[00:05:16.725 --> 00:05:18.386]  Please share this with everyone you know.
[00:05:26.522 --> 00:05:28.685]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:05:29.206 --> 00:05:31.829]  I'm Melissa Melton, and I'm here with Aaron Dykes.
[00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:38.257]  Coming up in the second half of the show, we are going to do a special report, air special report that we did on Agenda 21.
[00:05:38.337 --> 00:05:41.822]  But first, we thought we would give you a little background information on this report.
[00:05:42.594 --> 00:05:48.718]  We have the full news coming up, but we followed this Agenda 21 story, and the funny thing is we were actually doing separate stories.
[00:05:48.738 --> 00:05:51.761]  You were already following some of the local groups when you showed up.
[00:05:51.801 --> 00:05:57.945]  You just started a few weeks ago, but it turns out it's all so integrated, there's no way to avoid the bigger picture.
[00:05:57.965 --> 00:06:01.287]  I mean, why don't you just start to give them an idea of the kind of things we found?
[00:06:02.428 --> 00:06:06.031]  Well, it just seemed like once we started digging into it, it was
[00:06:07.006 --> 00:06:09.087]  More and more groups, more and more entities.
[00:06:09.127 --> 00:06:13.669]  It became local, then it was regional, then it was state, national, international.
[00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:14.890]  It just got bigger and bigger.
[00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:17.891]  Well, that's what Agenda 21 is.
[00:06:17.971 --> 00:06:22.153]  It's international, but it's about jumping through hoops so no one can be held accountable.
[00:06:22.453 --> 00:06:24.674]  You don't have your ordinary structure of government.
[00:06:24.754 --> 00:06:28.016]  It's about regional bodies who are going to make decisions for you.
[00:06:28.416 --> 00:06:30.457]  And this is the same stuff I was dealing with
[00:06:30.937 --> 00:06:44.047]  Six and a half years ago when I started working with Alex and we were doing research for Endgame and going to toll road meetings and the public was so angry they showed up by the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds to say no to these toll roads.
[00:06:44.788 --> 00:06:49.612]  But it turns out even though they said those were done with they were never really done with the toll roads.
[00:06:49.932 --> 00:06:54.035]  They were not done with smart growth here in Austin or across the country for that matter.
[00:06:54.495 --> 00:06:57.598]  They were just doing it by stealth and what we've discovered
[00:06:58.238 --> 00:07:00.699]  We went to these local Agenda 21 meetings.
[00:07:00.739 --> 00:07:01.939]  They don't call it that of course.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:12.363]  They say it's just the sustainable community development and they're trying to convince cities it's their idea to sign up for this kind of gigantic smart growth stuff.
[00:07:12.863 --> 00:07:14.884]  Oh yeah, they just keep telling people the whole time.
[00:07:15.284 --> 00:07:19.785]  This is your vision for your community even though these grants have been around for 10 years.
[00:07:22.506 --> 00:07:24.866]  Well, it's really a containment grid.
[00:07:25.187 --> 00:07:26.667]  They're moving towards the smart grid.
[00:07:26.687 --> 00:07:51.092]  They're moving to the age where humanity's trash, so we've already been priced out of the market, and now they have to have corrupt around the legal system so that new regulations, new burdens for having a business or having a home are placed on everyone, and only the people who know how and when, for that matter, to jump through the loopholes are able to have a business and meet all the new requirements, keep up with what the EPA is demanding,
[00:07:52.032 --> 00:07:55.216]  But that's the thing with these grants is it's all integrated.
[00:07:55.556 --> 00:08:01.784]  We're talking about communities that are signed up under federal HUD grants, put out by Obama.
[00:08:01.824 --> 00:08:06.689]  He has a Partnership for Sustainable Development, Partnership for Sustainable Communities.
[00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:09.473]  It's all Agenda 21, but they don't call it that.
[00:08:10.532 --> 00:08:23.023]  No, and the people that go to these meetings, they think they're going because they're going to do something really great, they're going to be involved in their community, and they don't even realize there's a larger agenda that's basically being imposed upon them when they show up at the door.
[00:08:23.303 --> 00:08:26.206]  That nothing they actually say while they're in there is going to change anything.
[00:08:26.586 --> 00:08:32.311]  All of the questions were leading, all of the answers were preset, and no matter what they did, it was going to be Agenda 21.
[00:08:33.223 --> 00:08:36.585]  Yeah, well it's all a hoax because they know it's this plannedopolis.
[00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:38.026]  It is a control grid.
[00:08:38.266 --> 00:08:49.353]  I don't know if you've seen that cartoon that's very telling where, you know, not too far in the future, it's a technocracy, computers run things, and you don't really have an income or a real job.
[00:08:49.373 --> 00:08:50.454]  You have a calorie card.
[00:08:50.854 --> 00:08:52.355]  They tell you what you can eat and when.
[00:08:52.795 --> 00:09:03.358]  That's the kind of communities they're planning, but they showed up to little small 10,000 person towns to different parts of Austin to tell you it's a good idea and it's your idea.
[00:09:03.498 --> 00:09:05.639]  And these are such manipulative liars.
[00:09:06.019 --> 00:09:12.261]  They told me to my face, I know you saw the same thing because we went through the footage, that no, this wasn't Agenda 21.
[00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:16.063]  They never heard of Agenda 21 and there's nothing nefarious going on.
[00:09:16.103 --> 00:09:19.584]  They're just basically polling communities to see what they want.
[00:09:20.623 --> 00:09:41.222]  Exactly and I mean the people there like I said before they just they would ask questions and they would say don't you want a five-story apartment building don't you know don't you and they're like no we just want regular houses like normal people so well these are rural towns that are 30 40 minutes outside of Austin but they have already planned 10 years ago I've literally seen all the plans written up
[00:09:41.863 --> 00:09:45.508]  It's been moving forward even though they're pretending nothing's happening.
[00:09:45.888 --> 00:09:52.197]  So they're planning to expand out to those rural towns, but they've showed up to those rural towns to get them to go along with it.
[00:09:52.497 --> 00:09:54.840]  I mean, why don't you tell them about the grocery store example?
[00:09:55.301 --> 00:09:55.782]  Oh yeah.
[00:09:55.902 --> 00:09:57.083]  For example, in Hutto,
[00:09:58.405 --> 00:10:06.186]  The people don't have a central grocery store in the town, and that's what they really... I think a lot of people who showed up to the meeting thought that that's what they were going there to get.
[00:10:06.206 --> 00:10:11.687]  And they asked a question, and they threw the grocery store in there as one of the answers, and 94% of people said yes.
[00:10:12.088 --> 00:10:19.049]  But when I interviewed the lady who was running the whole show, I said, so, you know, 94% of the people at this meeting said they want a grocery store here in town.
[00:10:19.069 --> 00:10:21.129]  Are you going to add that to your development zone?
[00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:22.990]  And she said, we're just here for planning.
[00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:24.710]  We can't just make a grocery store up here.
[00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:28.963]  So, I mean, she would never say that obviously in front of everybody, but...
[00:10:30.022 --> 00:10:37.064]  Well, look, the thing with Agenda 21, as we heard about it in-game, I helped Alex with the research, my mind was blown learning new things.
[00:10:37.504 --> 00:10:44.966]  You've seen Rosa Korian and these other authors talking about it, but that's all Agenda 21 under the United Nations banner.
[00:10:45.287 --> 00:10:47.587]  What's so evil is they're extremely deceptive.
[00:10:47.607 --> 00:10:48.928]  They don't tell you that's coming.
[00:10:49.388 --> 00:10:51.248]  Their plan is to implement it locally.
[00:10:51.288 --> 00:10:53.929]  They have these NGOs that work with the United Nations.
[00:10:54.349 --> 00:10:56.430]  The biggest one is the international
[00:10:57.475 --> 00:11:00.057]  Community for local environmental initiatives.
[00:11:00.757 --> 00:11:03.019]  See how they flip the international with the local.
[00:11:03.339 --> 00:11:07.161]  And their whole plan is to get cities to sign on so they don't have to convince states.
[00:11:07.481 --> 00:11:10.884]  They don't have to get formal treaties or laws passed at the federal level.
[00:11:11.184 --> 00:11:14.526]  They just go to individual towns and say, don't you want to be part of this plan?
[00:11:14.546 --> 00:11:15.407]  And by the way,
[00:11:16.087 --> 00:11:18.348]  There's kickbacks and that kind of thing.
[00:11:18.828 --> 00:11:21.810]  And so it comes in the name of sustainable communities.
[00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:24.831]  And no one's supposed to put this together, but you flip through these books.
[00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:26.292]  I've got a bunch of these handbooks.
[00:11:26.332 --> 00:11:28.213]  This one's towards sustainable communities.
[00:11:28.533 --> 00:11:30.434]  I've got another one that's online only.
[00:11:30.514 --> 00:11:33.815]  It's Local Agenda 21 and how to implement it.
[00:11:33.855 --> 00:11:35.036]  It's literally a handbook.
[00:11:35.396 --> 00:11:36.596]  And here we are at these meetings.
[00:11:36.617 --> 00:11:39.558]  They're implementing literally the same strategies word for word.
[00:11:40.058 --> 00:11:42.699]  Using terms like visioning sessions.
[00:11:42.819 --> 00:11:44.499]  These are community workshops.
[00:11:44.859 --> 00:11:50.380]  We're going to have mapping tools with sophisticated analyticals that are going to decide your future forum.
[00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.861]  And it would be bad enough if it were just the socialist model.
[00:11:53.901 --> 00:11:58.742]  You don't want that because bad people get into power and basically they want to kill people after a while.
[00:11:58.782 --> 00:12:00.082]  But you also lose your free will.
[00:12:00.122 --> 00:12:00.902]  That's bad too.
[00:12:01.322 --> 00:12:02.622]  And you can't really own a business.
[00:12:02.982 --> 00:12:05.943]  But it's even worse because they come at you deceptively.
[00:12:06.323 --> 00:12:08.084]  Yeah, and it was all manipulation.
[00:12:08.124 --> 00:12:17.491]  It was all Delphi technique stuff, which was, you know, RAND Corporation came up with that in the 50s for the Department of Defense for psychological warfare during the Cold War.
[00:12:17.772 --> 00:12:23.776]  And they're using it here on regular people who just think they're going into a town meeting to maybe get a grocery store.
[00:12:24.116 --> 00:12:28.540]  And they're telling them it's your idea for concentrated, smart, balanced growth.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.283]  And they're trying to concentrate growth for towns that barely even have 10 or 15,000 people.
[00:12:34.304 --> 00:12:38.326]  In a really large area that's rural and has tons of land everywhere.
[00:12:38.346 --> 00:12:42.249]  And they're saying, we gotta keep concentrating you into the middle of this work area in the center of town.
[00:12:42.689 --> 00:12:47.952]  Well, they're taking land, but then they're telling people that they have the right to live within those regulations.
[00:12:48.012 --> 00:12:49.293]  But that changes over time.
[00:12:49.713 --> 00:12:53.695]  Once they build up that infrastructure, that again has been on the plan for ten years.
[00:12:53.735 --> 00:12:54.896]  Have you not seen these plans, Alex?
[00:12:54.916 --> 00:12:56.557]  Well, I knew you guys were wound up to get in here.
[00:12:56.577 --> 00:12:58.358]  That's why I had you on live before the main show.
[00:12:58.398 --> 00:12:59.378]  You did a great job on this.
[00:13:00.419 --> 00:13:01.319]  These are bankers.
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:02.600]  Monopoly bankers.
[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:03.880]  They want rent seekers.
[00:13:04.361 --> 00:13:07.262]  So they can't... They have to teach that... I mean, you heard that professor.
[00:13:07.302 --> 00:13:08.662]  There's no land outside Austin.
[00:13:08.682 --> 00:13:10.263]  I don't know if you included that in the report.
[00:13:10.303 --> 00:13:11.003]  I saw most of it.
[00:13:11.343 --> 00:13:12.183]  There's no land!
[00:13:12.243 --> 00:13:15.105]  There's... Only like 98% is underhabited.
[00:13:15.605 --> 00:13:15.965]  Literally.
[00:13:16.405 --> 00:13:22.071]  So they have to teach you, oh there's no land, we've got to live all compact, and oh see how crowded it is, because we're all living compact.
[00:13:22.151 --> 00:13:25.154]  It's about that managed economy by the insiders.
[00:13:25.675 --> 00:13:26.676]  But anyways, great job.
[00:13:26.696 --> 00:13:29.198]  Just continue with your report and we'll do the whole news here in a moment.
[00:13:29.499 --> 00:13:32.422]  I just wanted to add, this is the dream of the slumlords.
[00:13:32.762 --> 00:13:35.465]  The globalists are basically slumlords on steroids and PCP.
[00:13:35.805 --> 00:13:38.567]  Well, you said bankers, and that's exactly what I found.
[00:13:38.887 --> 00:13:42.609]  When I used to go to smart growth conferences 15 years ago, it's all banker run.
[00:13:42.829 --> 00:13:45.490]  This is the same exact people who have been pushing smart growth.
[00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:54.155]  I got a bunch of their partners on the list, and it's people like the Urban Land Institute, or the Urban Land Foundation, or the Joint Center for Sustainable Development.
[00:13:54.455 --> 00:13:55.656]  You know what these groups are?
[00:13:55.936 --> 00:13:58.838]  They're all fronts for Rockefeller-owned organizations.
[00:13:59.138 --> 00:14:00.259]  They're fronts for J.P.
[00:14:00.319 --> 00:14:01.840]  Morgan people on the board.
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:06.621]  They've got Bain Capital people on the board and so forth and so on.
[00:14:06.661 --> 00:14:09.661]  They really are bankers posing as environmentalists.
[00:14:09.721 --> 00:14:11.242]  Oh yeah, they make it sound so good.
[00:14:11.302 --> 00:14:14.682]  It's grassroots, it's local, it'll make you feel good about the environment.
[00:14:14.982 --> 00:14:17.903]  I've just got to add how amazing it is to watch Teleprompter Free out there.
[00:14:18.243 --> 00:14:21.344]  Perhaps we should do a document cam and show people there's no teleprompters here.
[00:14:21.744 --> 00:14:32.126]  These are real researchers and Americans and freedom lovers who did the research and are actually giving you real data, not lazy reporters, most of them who aren't in on this,
[00:14:32.466 --> 00:14:34.247]  Who just regurgitate what they're told.
[00:14:34.547 --> 00:14:35.628]  And that's come out in the media.
[00:14:35.988 --> 00:14:39.170]  New York Times, you name it, are told what to write by the CIA.
[00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:40.591]  Not us, folks!
[00:14:40.971 --> 00:14:41.572]  Not us!
[00:14:42.212 --> 00:14:43.052]  But look at this list.
[00:14:43.112 --> 00:14:51.077]  It's all these environmental front organizations, all linked basically to Rockefeller or similar United Nations-loving billionaires.
[00:14:51.437 --> 00:14:54.339]  And they've wined and dined the mayors of the people of the region.
[00:14:54.359 --> 00:14:56.661]  They've wined and dined whoever owns these companies.
[00:14:56.961 --> 00:15:00.183]  They've taken out the commissioners and the counselors.
[00:15:00.343 --> 00:15:01.864]  Their land is where the
[00:15:02.384 --> 00:15:03.585]  Skyscraper gets built.
[00:15:04.186 --> 00:15:05.406]  Oh, guess what else we found?
[00:15:05.487 --> 00:15:06.327]  I don't want to cut into you.
[00:15:06.667 --> 00:15:24.441]  Rob Dew got footage when he went to check out Barton Springs, interviewed one of the Save Our Springs type people, obviously a well-meaning person, but she explained all the land they grabbed in the last couple years, showed the map, it was substantial, and Rob Dew said, oh, so there's no development on that land, right?
[00:15:25.102 --> 00:15:26.483]  It is safe for the environment, right?
[00:15:28.104 --> 00:15:28.304]  No.
[00:15:28.804 --> 00:15:32.786]  No, there's development, it's just... No, no, Kirk Watson who took the land, he gets to build on it!
[00:15:32.806 --> 00:15:34.747]  It's just sustainable development, Alex.
[00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:37.408]  So if you know how to fill out the papers, then you're good to go.
[00:15:37.468 --> 00:15:40.810]  But if you can't fill out the papers... Yeah, but you're on the same side with the local cohort that took it over.
[00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:45.612]  But if you've got a real business, you've got a bigger tax burden, more paperwork, and you basically can't do it.
[00:15:46.613 --> 00:15:47.073]  Exactly.
[00:15:47.513 --> 00:15:49.094]  If you can even get a bid on the land, I mean...
[00:15:50.407 --> 00:15:57.673]  Well, I was pretty shocked, too, to find out that we actually have a professor at UT who openly teaches Agenda 21, and he just thinks it's great.
[00:15:58.013 --> 00:16:08.281]  He thinks that's a wonderful thing, and he talked about collectivism and how, you know, urban design is really not about the rights of any one person to do, quote, whatever the hell they want.
[00:16:08.601 --> 00:16:09.702]  It's about the greater good.
[00:16:09.742 --> 00:16:13.585]  It's about the collective greater good, so... Well, let me make a point on that.
[00:16:14.065 --> 00:16:15.526]  They have a Delphi technique.
[00:16:15.566 --> 00:16:17.768]  This has all been planned up at the UN level.
[00:16:19.244 --> 00:16:20.985]  And then they tell you this is what you want.
[00:16:21.045 --> 00:16:27.407]  No, it's about them planning your world as control freak monsters, as power trippers.
[00:16:28.067 --> 00:16:33.749]  Because this is all directly out of the central banks who created the UN, the Rockefellers who created it.
[00:16:34.169 --> 00:16:35.289]  So see, it's all about freedom.
[00:16:35.569 --> 00:16:36.249]  It's your freedom.
[00:16:36.289 --> 00:16:37.490]  We have international grants.
[00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:38.910]  We're here running your town.
[00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:40.051]  It's going to be great.
[00:16:40.591 --> 00:16:43.592]  All you people outside the main city are going to be triple-taxed but us!
[00:16:45.993 --> 00:16:48.233]  It's your freedom to live in a 300 square foot box.
[00:16:48.614 --> 00:16:52.934]  It's a big marketing scam for some lousy GMO hamburger, that's the metaphor.
[00:16:53.255 --> 00:16:59.516]  But they show up, and I noticed, because I was at multiple meetings, it's not even people from the town, it's the same people showing up.
[00:16:59.576 --> 00:17:03.657]  It's the same planners, the same, uh, you know... And they try to act like it's not connected.
[00:17:03.737 --> 00:17:06.717]  Aaron, give yourself to them, they know best.
[00:17:07.037 --> 00:17:14.419]  You heard him talking, that, that voice, he's... But it's not, it's not United Nations, because he's not wearing the t-shirt of it or something, I mean...
[00:17:16.127 --> 00:17:17.288]  No, they count on your ignorance.
[00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:24.794]  Yeah, but if you dare to look up any of these groups, you'll see they're all connected to the worst, biggest money there is out there.
[00:17:25.094 --> 00:17:27.656]  The people who've already monopolized most of our future.
[00:17:27.676 --> 00:17:28.677]  But they care!
[00:17:29.677 --> 00:17:37.724]  I liked when you asked that guy if this was part of a more national plan, and he was like, no, this is just this local community here and a couple others around here.
[00:17:37.744 --> 00:17:38.925]  We're not connected to anything.
[00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:46.655]  He said the plan was developed in a town with 10,000 people as if the mayor stayed up late nights writing hundreds of pages of documents.
[00:17:47.155 --> 00:17:48.536]  And I said, I've got the plan right here.
[00:17:48.656 --> 00:17:49.777]  Here is the map, in fact.
[00:17:50.117 --> 00:17:58.663]  I handed him this map and he put it down real quick because it shows that not only Central Texas has a HUD grant for sustainable communities.
[00:17:58.743 --> 00:17:59.863]  Here, put it in document cam.
[00:17:59.903 --> 00:18:02.225]  Basically, every state in the whole nation does.
[00:18:02.465 --> 00:18:03.466]  Every metro plan.
[00:18:03.986 --> 00:18:04.927]  Oh, here's all their books.
[00:18:04.947 --> 00:18:06.908]  You notice they were all following the same talking points.
[00:18:07.048 --> 00:18:08.188]  Can you see California?
[00:18:08.228 --> 00:18:10.269]  They've got, what, a third of the whole state?
[00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:13.150]  All along those high-density railroads?
[00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:14.431]  They don't want power!
[00:18:14.491 --> 00:18:15.471]  They're just helping!
[00:18:15.791 --> 00:18:21.774]  This is the Agenda 21 map, and if you take this map and lay it over this one, it basically follows the whole thing through.
[00:18:21.794 --> 00:18:26.916]  Yeah, these are the central control hubs as the military launches its Soviet takeover.
[00:18:27.967 --> 00:18:32.891]  Well, it's also the capitals and the biggest metro areas from all these different states, so control that.
[00:18:32.931 --> 00:18:36.334]  You're basically going to have total control, if not major influence over us.
[00:18:36.374 --> 00:18:37.676]  It's a military takeover plan.
[00:18:38.016 --> 00:18:39.737]  We're not facing foreign armies.
[00:18:39.757 --> 00:18:42.139]  We're facing corporatists posing as trendies.
[00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.461]  Hey, we got long hair and sandals.
[00:18:44.722 --> 00:18:45.803]  Give us the cash!
[00:18:46.969 --> 00:18:50.532]  I don't know if people understand because you haven't flipped through these mind-numbing books.
[00:18:50.592 --> 00:19:07.066]  I mean, the brainwashers, if you read them from cover to cover, but they literally have stuff about how to approach the community, how to sell them on the idea, tell them they have something at stake, tell them it's a community forum, tell them it's a visioning center, and they use all these terms word for word.
[00:19:07.386 --> 00:19:18.954]  They don't even bother to change the terms or the names or anything, but then they have the gall to lie to us, to our faces, we have it all on tape, saying, no, this is not United Nations, not Agenda 21, never even heard of it.
[00:19:18.974 --> 00:19:20.114]  What is that?
[00:19:20.354 --> 00:19:24.337]  I like how I kept saying, well, you keep mentioning this is the solution.
[00:19:24.417 --> 00:19:31.922]  These meetings, these plannings, all this visioning, all this stuff, this is the solution to our problem, but you don't mention what the problem actually is.
[00:19:32.402 --> 00:19:34.564]  Nobody would actually say what the problem was.
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:41.709]  Well you've studied this stuff, you know the problem is... I know what the problem is, it's just they wouldn't say what it was!
[00:19:43.206 --> 00:19:46.328]  Well, eugenics is something I've spent a lot of time looking into.
[00:19:46.548 --> 00:19:50.930]  I've tried to follow the names, and they're always involved in these kind of environmental groups.
[00:19:51.050 --> 00:20:07.078]  Rockefeller is one of the most deeply involved in eugenics, and it is a very anti-human, it's a very elitist belief, and really, with the culmination of the rise of the Industrial Revolution, they decided labor isn't worth anything, and they want their future to be
[00:20:08.078 --> 00:20:09.119]  Just a few people.
[00:20:09.199 --> 00:20:14.104]  They think they're going to merge with robots and so they're happy to kill everyone because it's a liability.
[00:20:14.764 --> 00:20:16.686]  There's books from Ray Kurzweil.
[00:20:17.227 --> 00:20:20.490]  It's quoting sources from Bill Joyce on microsystems.
[00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:25.915]  They literally talk about whether to kill us all or keep us as pets and it's that simple.
[00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:33.582]  They're going to put us in these confinement zones and when they have a bio-plague or something they'll say it's for the environment and you should die.
[00:20:34.329 --> 00:20:34.810]  Basically.
[00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:48.143]  I mean, in the short term, they want to end our national sovereignty, they want to take away our property rights, and they want to force us all into a control grid in these many tiny apartments in these dense urban zones and basically control everything about our lives.
[00:20:48.183 --> 00:20:51.127]  In the long term, it's eugenicist control freaks.
[00:20:51.147 --> 00:20:52.208]  They just want to take us all out.
[00:20:52.737 --> 00:21:02.145]  Okay, but I've seen all of Alex's guests, the experts like Dr. Michael Kaufman, who read thousands and thousands of pages and created the maps and studied in detail what's going to happen.
[00:21:02.505 --> 00:21:12.454]  It's a totally different thing to look into it for yourself, to go to these meetings, look these people in the eye and realize that they know what they're a part of, but they're acting like they have no idea.
[00:21:12.474 --> 00:21:14.375]  And they've sold themselves out for what?
[00:21:15.716 --> 00:21:16.937]  And they're doing it anyway.
[00:21:17.478 --> 00:21:18.679]  And they're smiling while they do it.
[00:21:19.198 --> 00:21:21.800]  Look into these names and who's behind it, you'll be flabbergasted.
[00:21:22.061 --> 00:21:23.142]  No, it'll blow your mind.
[00:21:23.462 --> 00:21:28.186]  And we're going to follow up on this subject too because we've got more meetings and I've got more books to plow through.
[00:21:28.206 --> 00:21:29.447]  We've got a lot more.
[00:21:30.188 --> 00:21:30.669]  For sure.
[00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:33.211]  Thanks for watching and enjoy.
[00:21:40.738 --> 00:21:42.680]  This is the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:43.620]  I'm Aaron Dykes.
[00:21:44.261 --> 00:21:45.162]  And I'm Melissa Melton.
[00:21:45.856 --> 00:21:48.398]  Agenda 21 is not a conspiracy theory.
[00:21:48.798 --> 00:21:57.205]  And while it may seem harmless or even helpful on the surface, it is a UN-inspired, banker-funded scheme to institute a global government from the ground up.
[00:21:57.665 --> 00:22:02.189]  Right here, right now, our country is being taken over in the name of sustainable development.
[00:22:02.791 --> 00:22:11.856]  Local environmental groups are meeting in towns across America backed by big federal grant money, but behind that, entities like the Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:22:12.316 --> 00:22:22.242]  Their sustainable community meetings are not only a takeover, but a buy-in to a plant society controlled by a psychopathic elite, all sold with a smile.
[00:22:22.782 --> 00:22:30.847]  So to find out more, we decided to investigate some of those local meetings taking place in Texas to find out about the dark deception
[00:22:31.277 --> 00:22:33.057]  Behind this Agenda 21 scheme.
[00:22:33.718 --> 00:22:39.639]  They had growth on them so quickly and so heavily they didn't have time to plan.
[00:22:39.679 --> 00:22:41.600]  What is sustainable development?
[00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.760]  Conservation of energy resources.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.341]  People that live there maybe don't have to drive as much.
[00:22:46.381 --> 00:22:48.481]  Concentrated and balanced growth.
[00:22:48.521 --> 00:22:50.362]  Concentrated and balanced growth.
[00:22:50.382 --> 00:22:51.142]  A kind of growth.
[00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:53.970]  We're good to go.
[00:23:09.736 --> 00:23:28.730]  The Housing and Urban Development Department of the United States awarded Sustainable Communities Regional Planning grants to Texas, giving $3.7 million to the Capital Area Council of Governments in a project that spanned Austin, Texas, as well as neighboring rural communities that include Elgin,
[00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:31.652]  Lockhart, Hutto and Dripping Springs.
[00:23:32.112 --> 00:23:44.380]  The grant specifies guidelines for energy use and climate change mitigation as well as the integration of smart housing, nearby job sectors and integrated transportation systems.
[00:23:45.061 --> 00:23:53.627]  The members of the project we spoke with in Elgin were apparently unaware of HUD's related agenda to the larger Agenda 21 program.
[00:23:54.547 --> 00:23:55.968]  Agenda what?
[00:23:56.068 --> 00:23:57.089]  Agenda 21.
[00:23:57.149 --> 00:23:58.350]  What's the number stand for?
[00:23:59.043 --> 00:23:59.483]  21st century.
[00:24:00.063 --> 00:24:01.584]  And what does that mean?
[00:24:02.444 --> 00:24:04.044]  You can look it up on the internet.
[00:24:04.064 --> 00:24:06.545]  I'm not familiar with it at all, so I couldn't comment on that.
[00:24:06.565 --> 00:24:10.186]  So I'm not sure what the criteria or the outline is for that.
[00:24:10.226 --> 00:24:15.227]  Respectfully, there is no national treaty that obligates local governments to follow Agenda 21.
[00:24:15.267 --> 00:24:16.127]  That just doesn't exist.
[00:24:16.147 --> 00:24:16.767]  That's a myth.
[00:24:16.807 --> 00:24:19.908]  We're promoting sustainable, responsible development.
[00:24:20.948 --> 00:24:22.909]  But it's nothing to do with the United Nations.
[00:24:22.949 --> 00:24:28.170]  I mean, you know, if that's just paranoia, I'm sorry.
[00:24:28.996 --> 00:24:31.938]  In fact, there is an international agenda at work.
[00:24:32.499 --> 00:24:41.986]  Austin is a model city for the ICLEI, the NGO partnered with the United Nations to push for local Agenda 21 implementation.
[00:24:42.186 --> 00:24:52.435]  In the name of sustainability, they've taken on some of the most ambitious carbon cuts in the entire nation and are a model for energy conservation and zero waste.
[00:24:53.095 --> 00:24:53.696]  We're good to go.
[00:25:09.774 --> 00:25:16.817]  Specifically congratulated the cities and towns receiving these HUD grants for sustainable communities and regional planning.
[00:25:17.177 --> 00:25:26.260]  So it is absurd to claim that there is no international agenda interacting with these local communities as they attempt to implement sustainable development goals.
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:37.444]  Well I know a lot about Agenda 21 and I don't have any concerns because I don't think this project is driven by the international community or even by the national community.
[00:25:37.464 --> 00:25:38.785]  I think it's driven by Elgin, Texas.
[00:25:39.116 --> 00:25:43.457]  Except it's been implemented nationally under treaty and these grants are coming from the federal level.
[00:25:43.517 --> 00:25:48.218]  I think it's really dishonest not to admit there's an Agenda 21 motive.
[00:25:48.278 --> 00:25:52.899]  Sustainability is just about letting local communities decide for themselves.
[00:25:53.079 --> 00:25:58.821]  We had heard so much about what Agenda 21 wasn't, we decided to interview a professor that teaches it.
[00:25:59.321 --> 00:26:07.283]  This is Dean Almey, an Associate Professor and Director of Graduate Programs in Urban Design and Landscape Architecture at the University of Texas.
[00:26:07.802 --> 00:26:15.749]  Now in Texas, Texas Triangle is one of the 10 identified mega regions of the United States.
[00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:22.715]  And the projections, which were pretty much just confirmed by the recent census data that was released, are that
[00:26:23.055 --> 00:26:25.537]  He teaches Agenda 21 courses at the university.
[00:26:46.032 --> 00:26:51.936]  Which I call Agenda 21, really deals with the question of sustainable urbanism.
[00:26:52.216 --> 00:26:56.618]  How do we begin to sort of build the city more sustainably moving forward?
[00:26:56.979 --> 00:27:02.362]  What is Agenda 21, kind of a brief overview, and why you feel that it's an important plan?
[00:27:03.859 --> 00:27:31.343]  Well, it was a resolution of the United Nations where a number of countries got together, ostensibly in Rio, also called the Rio Declaration, to begin to look at the way in which humans were occupying the world, the state of the world, the state of civilization in the world, how we were using resources,
[00:27:32.063 --> 00:27:42.294]  Whether the consumption of resources and global development was being achieved ecologically and equitably.
[00:27:42.776 --> 00:27:46.318]  I was going to ask you if you wanted to talk about that quote a little bit.
[00:28:08.615 --> 00:28:23.725]  Well, I mean, already, you know, if we're looking for code words, okay, so already in that quote is the term collective, which, you know, a conspiracy theorist could somehow associate with, you know, I don't know, the Soviet Union, right?
[00:28:23.925 --> 00:28:26.247]  And that's not the intent.
[00:28:27.268 --> 00:28:30.990]  Collective just means us together as a society.
[00:28:32.031 --> 00:28:34.853]  So, yeah, I kind of stand behind that, actually.
[00:28:35.573 --> 00:28:38.814]  Cities are not individual constructs built by single people.
[00:28:39.414 --> 00:28:48.396]  Cities are collective constructs where we all live together and we have to balance the needs of individuals and the needs of collective society.
[00:28:48.616 --> 00:29:02.580]  Cities, by their very nature, would be very difficult to construct and manage and develop if they were all sort of politically anarchic.
[00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:19.599]  Agenda 21 Sustainable Development Visioning Meetings rely on the Delphi Technique, a manipulation tactic wherein a facilitator ensures a public forum goes as planned, with a predetermined outcome already decided upon by those who ultimately called the meeting.
[00:29:20.319 --> 00:29:25.182]  The Delphi Technique was created by the Rand Corporation in the 1950s for the U.S.
[00:29:25.202 --> 00:29:28.925]  Department of Defense to use as a psychological weapon during the Cold War.
[00:29:29.895 --> 00:29:35.837]  While community feedback is encouraged, the final outcome is driven by leading questions and preset answers.
[00:29:36.857 --> 00:29:41.959]  Notice in this presentation how your participation automatically equals acceptance.
[00:29:42.659 --> 00:29:46.601]  These same exact strategies were outlined in detail in the local AGENDA 21 Handbook.
[00:29:48.001 --> 00:29:51.483]  We saw this at both Sustainable Development meetings we attended.
[00:29:52.163 --> 00:29:58.286]  No matter what answer a community member chose, it all fed into the Agenda 21 plan already underway.
[00:29:59.167 --> 00:30:06.691]  The project planners admitted they weren't working with a blank slate, but were instead following a plan already mapped out by so-called stakeholders.
[00:30:07.605 --> 00:30:13.490]  What we want to be really clear about is that we're not starting from sort of an empty slate.
[00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:20.376]  Your community has done a lot of work in setting in place lots of plans and policies like the Comprehensive Plan.
[00:30:20.456 --> 00:30:21.116]  We're planners.
[00:30:21.276 --> 00:30:28.582]  We've been involved in projects mostly in central Austin and around that area.
[00:30:29.483 --> 00:30:32.646]  We worked on the Miller redevelopment for many years.
[00:30:32.966 --> 00:30:33.887]  We're still working on it.
[00:30:34.487 --> 00:30:35.188]  Yes, but just recently.
[00:30:35.248 --> 00:30:37.491]  Is this a part of that plan?
[00:30:37.511 --> 00:30:37.651]  No.
[00:30:37.671 --> 00:30:39.232]  Is it affiliated in any way?
[00:30:54.948 --> 00:31:03.253]  The reason I ask is because you use a lot of the same terminology, visioning workshops and sustainable development, and a lot of that falls under that plan and I just didn't know.
[00:31:03.393 --> 00:31:09.056]  Well, that is very traditional planning talk from the last probably 30 years.
[00:31:09.637 --> 00:31:12.538]  So we always talk about, you know, having a vision.
[00:31:12.699 --> 00:31:14.680]  What is the general big picture vision?
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.321]  But there's a larger agenda going on.
[00:31:17.361 --> 00:31:18.762]  I mean, this is a regional development.
[00:31:18.782 --> 00:31:19.943]  It didn't start here in Elgin.
[00:31:19.983 --> 00:31:22.464]  These proposals didn't originate here in Elgin.
[00:31:22.484 --> 00:31:23.745]  They're being done in other cities.
[00:31:24.355 --> 00:31:26.995]  I think these proposals did originate here in Elgin.
[00:31:27.075 --> 00:31:32.496]  Why are all these plans springing up all at once at the same exact time, all over the country, all over every city though?
[00:31:32.516 --> 00:31:33.857]  It's not a coordinated effort.
[00:31:34.957 --> 00:31:37.857]  Well, I don't want to be contentious with you.
[00:31:38.037 --> 00:31:40.518]  I would just say that I think that's a myth.
[00:31:41.078 --> 00:31:42.698]  They're not springing up all over the country.
[00:31:42.718 --> 00:31:44.859]  In this whole region, there's four cities looking at it.
[00:31:45.279 --> 00:31:52.880]  In fact, these sustainable communities were popping up in nearly every major metro area across the country, all funded by HUD.
[00:31:53.420 --> 00:32:09.111]  And these sustainable communities are pursuing the international agenda under President Obama's Partnership for Sustainable Communities, joining together the policies and regulations of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Traffic, and the EPA.
[00:32:09.791 --> 00:32:13.773]  I actually went to my first sustainable development meeting last week.
[00:32:13.994 --> 00:32:22.078]  They received a federal grant from Obama's Partnership for Sustainable Communities and they seem to use a lot of the same language in Agenda 21.
[00:32:22.158 --> 00:32:28.282]  I didn't know if you knew about those sustainable meetings that have been happening around here and if those are somehow connected.
[00:32:30.734 --> 00:32:34.697]  There are a number of layers of sustainability.
[00:32:34.777 --> 00:32:38.059]  I mean, almost to the point where the term itself is sort of overused.
[00:32:38.739 --> 00:32:53.289]  But here at the School of Architecture, we have a Center for Sustainable Development, which does get grants from foundations, sometimes from federal government, usually from philanthropic foundations.
[00:32:54.150 --> 00:33:00.334]  And they are a clearinghouse for a whole series of different initiatives.
[00:33:01.415 --> 00:33:06.740]  Texas has been faced with so-called smart growth proposals for well over a decade now.
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:22.013]  For years, bureaucrats in the Texas area laughed in the faces of activists, even as they gave passionate speeches defying the implementation of toll roads and other unnecessary infrastructure already owned by the state of Texas and its citizens.
[00:33:22.794 --> 00:33:36.336]  Instead, unelected regional boards like Campo moved the measures forward as best they could, while insiders who amounted to little more than thieves skimmed off the top and made millions off of secret deals.
[00:33:37.341 --> 00:33:43.864]  And yet we see some of the same regional players pushing for further development in the name of sustainability.
[00:33:44.244 --> 00:33:51.268]  The Central Texas Vision for Growth was directed by CAPCOG, Trust for Public Land, and Envision Central Texas.
[00:33:52.008 --> 00:34:03.854]  These entities, in turn, are shaped and steered by countless environmental groups controlled and funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, the Ford Foundation, George Soros, and Ted Turner, among others.
[00:34:04.574 --> 00:34:07.436]  Their alignment with Agenda 21 is well documented.
[00:34:08.176 --> 00:34:13.779]  Sustainable development was coined by the United Nations to mask a covert takeover at the local level.
[00:34:14.519 --> 00:34:26.345]  Land conservation and smart growth planning have been used to subsidize insiders, allowing development to be hijacked while the system picks winners and losers, reaping the profits at our expense.
[00:34:27.086 --> 00:34:30.467]  Everything in green is the protected area.
[00:34:30.487 --> 00:34:33.209]  So you see there's not really much protected areas 15 years ago.
[00:34:34.457 --> 00:34:36.280]  Two years ago, this is the work that we did.
[00:34:38.683 --> 00:34:51.020]  All this land was purchased by the city of Austin, or the county, and we used our funds and our political clout to encourage the city to purchase these lands for protection.
[00:34:51.638 --> 00:34:53.460]  Has any of that been developed on?
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.562]  Yes.
[00:34:56.523 --> 00:34:59.086]  So this does not mean there is no development.
[00:34:59.166 --> 00:35:04.872]  What it means is that the development is done in a sustainable and ecologically friendly way.
[00:35:05.152 --> 00:35:09.377]  By implementing Agenda 21, it's a local implementation.
[00:35:09.497 --> 00:35:11.079]  It's from the bottom up kind of thing.
[00:35:11.799 --> 00:35:27.634]  That by putting all these regulations environmentally and putting them on the urban areas that are usually the economic centers for cities, that you're sort of picking winners and losers in a way because you're saying that only people who will adhere to these things are allowed to develop.
[00:35:28.075 --> 00:35:31.017]  And so there's kind of a bigger agenda there with that.
[00:35:31.198 --> 00:35:33.159]  I don't know what your thoughts are on that.
[00:35:34.289 --> 00:35:39.932]  I would turn it around a little bit, and I would say, I don't know that we're picking winners or losers.
[00:35:40.372 --> 00:35:44.634]  This is not a kind of environmental nepotism that's going on.
[00:35:45.235 --> 00:35:49.317]  But, I think it's a mistake to think that rules don't already exist everywhere.
[00:35:50.277 --> 00:35:53.998]  United Nations has made its anti-private property stance abundantly clear.
[00:35:54.458 --> 00:35:58.759]  Quote, land cannot be treated as an ordinary asset controlled by individuals.
[00:35:59.359 --> 00:36:06.301]  Private land ownership is also a principal instrument of accumulation and concentration of wealth and therefore contributes to social injustice.
[00:36:06.881 --> 00:36:13.502]  The provision of decent dwellings and healthy conditions for the people can only be achieved if land is used in the interest of society as a whole.
[00:36:13.882 --> 00:36:15.423]  First of all we have to believe
[00:36:16.323 --> 00:36:23.568]  That humans need to live kind of symbiotically with the Earth, that we're not here to dominate the Earth.
[00:36:24.248 --> 00:36:32.173]  You know, when the United States was founded and many of the original sort of authors and thinkers who wrote about, you know, society in the U.S.
[00:36:32.634 --> 00:36:38.377]  and people like Thoreau, for example, there was a sort of idea that the U.S.
[00:36:38.417 --> 00:36:43.841]  was this great wilderness, that we could just go out and sort of settle the wilderness and be pioneers and
[00:36:44.421 --> 00:36:46.544]  Live on our own and be independent.
[00:36:47.485 --> 00:36:50.028]  And I don't think it's like that anymore.
[00:36:50.448 --> 00:36:53.172]  I mean, there's very little wilderness left in the United States.
[00:36:54.457 --> 00:37:03.019]  Sustainable development is the philosophy designed to bring human beings across the globe under the full control of a narrow human elite.
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:07.601]  It's a 40 chapter document to basically control the world.
[00:37:08.361 --> 00:37:11.922]  It's based entirely on socialist control mechanisms.
[00:37:12.602 --> 00:37:15.323]  Sustainable developers have designed a global movement.
[00:37:15.643 --> 00:37:22.287]  Coordinated through a global to local action plan to create world government in accordance with certain objectives.
[00:37:22.867 --> 00:37:25.148]  An end to national sovereignty.
[00:37:25.969 --> 00:37:27.930]  The abolition of private property.
[00:37:28.655 --> 00:37:31.637]  The suburbs bring with them their own kind of tyranny, right?
[00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:57.521]  One is, public space is almost non-existent in terms of real public space.
[00:37:57.621 --> 00:37:58.262]  There's lots of lawn.
[00:37:59.642 --> 00:37:59.842]  Right?
[00:38:00.162 --> 00:38:01.864]  But real collective public space.
[00:38:02.704 --> 00:38:09.168]  There's the tyranny, I would argue, of the nuclear family.
[00:38:09.649 --> 00:38:11.410]  Not that that's tyranny in itself.
[00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:11.910]  It's not.
[00:38:12.591 --> 00:38:16.353]  But the wife having to drive their kids to everything.
[00:38:16.854 --> 00:38:18.675]  Having to drop your kids off at school.
[00:38:18.735 --> 00:38:20.116]  Having to pick your kids up at school.
[00:38:20.456 --> 00:38:22.257]  Having to drive them to Little League.
[00:38:22.477 --> 00:38:29.202]  Everything is about one member of a family having to basically play a support role
[00:38:29.882 --> 00:38:30.363]  We're good to go.
[00:38:46.209 --> 00:38:53.754]  Living in an environment dominated by patterns that are automobile dependent is a big problem.
[00:38:54.395 --> 00:39:02.680]  This is a Jena 21 map that claims that that is what, if Jena 21 was fully implemented, the United States would look like.
[00:39:03.941 --> 00:39:04.982]  I don't know if you've ever seen that.
[00:39:05.002 --> 00:39:06.222]  I haven't seen this map before.
[00:39:06.703 --> 00:39:12.126]  And this is something that opponents have said is the ultimate plan of a Jena 21.
[00:39:12.166 --> 00:39:15.829]  I didn't know if you had heard of this map or seen it before.
[00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:22.851]  I haven't seen the map before, but I know where some of the principles behind the map come from.
[00:39:23.191 --> 00:39:40.977]  It's trying to kind of suggest that if we were to develop networks, networks of water, networks of plant habitat, networks of animal habitat, networks of human habitat, how would these networks begin to interact?
[00:39:41.337 --> 00:39:44.038]  What areas would need to be preserved from development?
[00:39:44.398 --> 00:39:46.121]  There is a pretty great fear of this.
[00:39:46.181 --> 00:39:49.446]  I've found a lot out there about this plan.
[00:39:51.369 --> 00:39:58.740]  It really will somehow end property rights, people's personal property rights, that it will end national sovereignty eventually.
[00:39:59.801 --> 00:40:03.906]  Give it up to a whole global entity now that will kind of take control over everything.
[00:40:03.986 --> 00:40:06.308]  That's kind of the general consensus.
[00:40:06.529 --> 00:40:15.619]  You know what will end national sovereignty faster than some fictitious conspiracy based on a United Nations declaration?
[00:40:18.842 --> 00:40:21.025]  Major ecological catastrophe.
[00:40:22.443 --> 00:40:22.723]  You know?
[00:40:23.663 --> 00:40:34.766]  And to be honest, in my opinion, I think one has to come to terms with the fact that such things as global warming exist.
[00:40:35.286 --> 00:40:44.009]  If you don't believe global warming exists, or if you believe that man is on this planet to dominate the world, then you don't care about these things.
[00:40:45.309 --> 00:40:56.878]  It should be noted that the professor admitted to democratic socialist leanings once the cameras were off, and that his father worked for the CIA as evidenced by a paperweight he displayed on his desk during the interview.
[00:40:57.799 --> 00:41:07.046]  While he talked in circles on many concepts, and seemed to contend that he knew what was best for humanity, he refused to acknowledge any nefarious motives behind Agenda 21.
[00:41:08.217 --> 00:41:12.399]  Most of the people here in Elgin don't know or care what Agenda 21 is.
[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:15.661]  I don't care what Agenda 21's agenda is.
[00:41:16.142 --> 00:41:16.722]  Think about it.
[00:41:16.922 --> 00:41:25.087]  These local planners are trying to concentrate smart growth in small towns of barely 15,000 people in the second largest state in the nation.
[00:41:25.387 --> 00:41:25.687]  I think so.
[00:41:47.592 --> 00:41:49.634]  Takeover doesn't even begin to explain it.
[00:41:49.654 --> 00:41:53.338]  There really are no words for this level of evil and greed.
