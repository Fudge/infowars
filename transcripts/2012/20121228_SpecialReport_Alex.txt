[00:00:00.365 --> 00:00:13.276]  Last Friday, InfoWars.com posted a petition to WhiteHouse.gov calling for British-born propagandists, here's Morgan, to be deported to the UK.
[00:00:13.897 --> 00:00:20.602]  And this was done really in a tongue-in-cheek way to illustrate that he's trying to get rid of our Second Amendment right to self-defense.
[00:00:21.303 --> 00:00:26.986]  And so he doesn't have any First Amendment right, because in truth, foreigners, and he is not a U.S.
[00:00:27.046 --> 00:00:31.788]  citizen, can be deported for seditious activity or subversion.
[00:00:32.108 --> 00:00:38.131]  And we presented those Supreme Court cases, and the Wall Street Journal concurred with us over the weekend.
[00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:46.975]  But it was amazing to see literally thousands of publications, from the New York Times to the London Guardian, say, how dare you be against his free speech?
[00:00:48.291 --> 00:00:49.312]  We knew you would do that.
[00:00:49.372 --> 00:00:50.212]  That was the whole point.
[00:00:50.252 --> 00:00:53.074]  We said that in our article about the petition on Friday.
[00:00:53.434 --> 00:00:59.098]  That it was there to illustrate that we have a bunch of foreign globalists here trying to take our second amendment.
[00:00:59.418 --> 00:01:01.840]  How would you like to lose your first?
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.600]  Okay?
[00:01:03.141 --> 00:01:05.342]  That's the issue that we're dealing with here.
[00:01:05.942 --> 00:01:06.963]  Now, I've got to say this.
[00:01:07.083 --> 00:01:11.946]  I think of all the different news reports we've put out that have gone viral, this is probably the biggest.
[00:01:12.186 --> 00:01:13.848]  There are tens of thousands
[00:01:14.728 --> 00:01:28.774]  Of news articles out there about the petition nearing 100,000 and the fact that the White House, by the way, does not respond to the petitions for secession or petitions to have the U.S.
[00:01:28.794 --> 00:01:30.195]  government not fund Al-Qaeda.
[00:01:30.735 --> 00:01:35.257]  They pick and choose the petitions that they want to give attention to.
[00:01:35.537 --> 00:01:40.419]  Within a few days, they've used the anti-gun petition saying, you want us to take the guns, we will.
[00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:53.168]  So the petition itself is a fraud, but it can still be used as a tool to illustrate the absurdity and fraud of all these foreigners over here lecturing us, because the globalists want to break our will.
[00:01:53.609 --> 00:02:10.582]  They want to train us that, you know, the TSA can stick their hands down our pants, the NSA can spy on us without warrants, the police can set up warrantless checkpoints on the highway, and all these foreigners and synthetic citizens like Fareed Zarkaria can sit there and lecture us
[00:02:11.403 --> 00:02:12.164]  We're good to go.
[00:02:26.198 --> 00:02:28.980]  That would basically end the Second Amendment as we know it.
[00:02:29.341 --> 00:02:34.485]  And I covered that in an earlier video tonight here on InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:02:34.985 --> 00:02:42.551]  But it should also be pointed out the petitions have been started in the UK where British citizens are saying please don't send Piers Morgan back.
[00:02:43.652 --> 00:02:45.454]  We already basically ran him out of the country.
[00:02:46.034 --> 00:02:49.777]  And many of his colleagues in News Corp have gone to jail.
[00:02:50.714 --> 00:02:51.335]  We're good to go.
[00:03:09.893 --> 00:03:15.677]  I personally have been on CNN many times, Fox News many times, and really don't get much of a response.
[00:03:16.237 --> 00:03:35.031]  So I'm not crying over the fact that out of thousands and thousands and thousands of news articles a day in the last week since this story broke, we have been given credit for originating the call for him to be deported and only a few.
[00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:43.916]  DrudgeReport.com pretty much forced the story out into the mainstream when he linked to our stories and our petitions.
[00:03:43.956 --> 00:03:53.220]  So credit goes to DrudgeReport.com for journalistic standards and sourcing who originated the story.
[00:03:54.321 --> 00:04:06.546]  But it really illustrates the fear of the old dinosaur media that more and more is supporting the Fairness Doctrine to restrict free speech on talk radio, and it is more and more supporting restrictions of free speech on the Internet.
[00:04:07.326 --> 00:04:15.950]  And that goes to our next story in a moment, that you have a perfect storm of globalist, corrupt, monopolistic, insider corporations with corrupt government.
[00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:29.042]  Along with the old dinosaur dying media that is imploding, has no credibility and is a shadow of what it once was, you have this perfect storm now where they have a real incentive to try to knock out the new media.
[00:04:29.423 --> 00:04:35.725]  I mean, Piers Morgan is the top show on CNN and he has half a million viewers on his best night.
[00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:38.326]  It was the top number I saw for this year so far.
[00:04:38.366 --> 00:04:38.527]  It was 500,000, 556,000.
[00:04:39.107 --> 00:04:46.212]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, I have more listeners than that an hour on my syndicated radio show.
[00:04:46.853 --> 00:04:48.574]  And I'm barely in the top 10 of radio shows.
[00:04:48.594 --> 00:04:53.598]  I mean, there are some radio shows with 15, 16, 17 million listeners a day on record.
[00:04:54.494 --> 00:05:06.499]  And so you've got the old establishment media acting like it's dominant with these huge $10 million sets and all these huge guests, and it is the Emperor's new clothes.
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.160]  The Emperor is butt naked.
[00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.011]  A reminder of the Billy Idol song, Dancing With Myself.
[00:05:15.031 --> 00:05:22.212]  I mean, they've got the music turned up, dancing around in their bedroom or in their kitchen, by themselves, as if they're in control.
[00:05:22.992 --> 00:05:25.613]  But in a way, that hoax still works with some people.
[00:05:26.073 --> 00:05:35.115]  Even though CNN and MSNBC are pretty much universally hated, except for their small gaggle of communist sympathizers, who don't even know it's a corporate fraud system.
[00:05:36.442 --> 00:05:39.903]  Still they're able to put it over on the public that they are the establishment.
[00:05:40.523 --> 00:05:45.605]  So it's time to break that fraud and realize me thinks you protest too much.
[00:05:45.945 --> 00:05:51.227]  I mean how did AP and Reuters and again thousands of other news articles.
[00:05:51.247 --> 00:05:52.307]  I mean I've scanned over them.
[00:05:52.888 --> 00:05:58.189]  I've gone done the search with Alex Jones or Curt Nemo or Infowars.com in association with the Piers Morgan story.
[00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:59.550]  Go do it yourself.
[00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.771]  There were a few the day before Christmas.
[00:06:04.392 --> 00:06:04.852]  And that's it.
[00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:13.816]  So it's just amazing that the, quote, journalistic standards are, they wouldn't tell you that, hey, a talk show host created this.
[00:06:13.876 --> 00:06:15.818]  They wouldn't want that to be in the news story.
[00:06:16.218 --> 00:06:17.379]  That'd be the first thing.
[00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:23.844]  But see, we still win because we don't need the old, dying, fraudulent media.
[00:06:24.404 --> 00:06:34.733]  And our goal was to illustrate we've got a foreigner over here fleeing all sorts of criminal justice investigations who is lecturing us.
[00:06:34.814 --> 00:06:36.015]  So we win.
[00:06:36.715 --> 00:06:47.265]  And quite frankly, I have been mentioned in my website link to before in, let's not exaggerate, 10,000 stories or more in one day.
[00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:53.891]  In the case of Charlie Sheen, three or four times in different media events on my radio show.
[00:06:54.811 --> 00:06:59.293]  There have been other cases where I've been in thousands and thousands of newspapers, and I want to tell you something.
[00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:02.274]  Almost no response.
[00:07:04.645 --> 00:07:08.027]  Almost no response in traffic to InfoWars.com.
[00:07:08.367 --> 00:07:21.975]  But I can go on some local talk show in Chicago, or New York, or Dallas, with a talk show host that is mild-mannered, who is polite, who isn't arrogant, and have the traffic blown off the chart.
[00:07:22.915 --> 00:07:25.797]  I can go on Coast to Coast AM, second biggest radio show in the country.
[00:07:26.737 --> 00:07:27.658]  Sixteen million listeners.
[00:07:28.138 --> 00:07:29.359]  And it can crash our site.
[00:07:29.999 --> 00:07:32.320]  We've gotten three or four million visitors in one night before.
[00:07:32.981 --> 00:07:34.562]  DrudgeReport.com links to us.
[00:07:34.602 --> 00:07:37.203]  We could get a million, two million visitors sometimes.
[00:07:37.403 --> 00:07:37.884]  Massive!
[00:07:39.484 --> 00:07:41.065]  And again, where's the arrogance?
[00:07:41.145 --> 00:07:45.388]  Where is Matt Drudge parading around like he's the Goblin King, Michael Moore?
[00:07:47.449 --> 00:07:54.395]  It is just incredible how these people, but that's why kings always wore big crowns and big robes and had people blow trumpets.
[00:07:54.735 --> 00:07:58.078]  That's why Hollywood shows up and has fake photographers, you know, they've hired.
[00:07:58.718 --> 00:08:00.480]  That's how that started 50, 60 years ago.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.961]  And the paparazzi grew out of that.
[00:08:02.161 --> 00:08:08.206]  They'd have the publicity team from the big, uh, you know, production house there.
[00:08:09.387 --> 00:08:17.171]  From the big movie studio, taking the photos is part of the hype, and they'd pay the media to be there, and they'd have free food and hookers for everybody.
[00:08:18.091 --> 00:08:20.292]  This is from the 30s, 40s and 50s of Hollywood.
[00:08:20.632 --> 00:08:21.993]  So they created this.
[00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:32.137]  Edward Bernays, the father of modern propaganda, bragged that they would merge politicians and movie stars to give government this air of all this royal power.
[00:08:33.098 --> 00:08:33.838]  And it's a fraud.
[00:08:35.034 --> 00:09:00.013]  But I've thought, just to illustrate it, we should bring like a big gold throne in, and something, like once a week I should do it, with like bling, like a big giant gold chain around my neck, and maybe some chicks in bikinis dancing behind me, and I could just get up here and then talk about freedom and liberty, and everybody tune in, come to the mainline dumbbells, and go, oh my gosh, this guy, we need to listen to him, he's got two models in bikinis dancing behind him.
[00:09:00.053 --> 00:09:02.575]  We gotta do that, Rob, who's filming this, as a joke.
[00:09:04.517 --> 00:09:04.777]  I don't know.
[00:09:24.895 --> 00:09:29.439]  That even when it's on Drudge Report and all these other big sites that we put out the petition.
[00:09:29.719 --> 00:09:31.440]  This is a huge international story.
[00:09:31.881 --> 00:09:36.364]  And it's caused a debate about why are there, not just Morgan, but all these other foreigners here lecturing us.
[00:09:36.725 --> 00:09:39.367]  Why do you need to be British to even be on our news nowadays?
[00:09:39.787 --> 00:09:41.729]  There's more Brits, it seems, than Infobabes.
[00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:43.650]  And so we won.
[00:09:43.891 --> 00:09:44.992]  You fail again.
[00:09:45.012 --> 00:09:45.912]  You are jokes.
[00:09:46.473 --> 00:09:52.598]  And all the king's horses and all the king's men are not going to put your globalist propaganda system back together again.
[00:09:54.696 --> 00:09:56.157]  Just a newsflash here.
[00:10:10.126 --> 00:10:14.067]  You're such a stupid little man saying we need guns to protect ourselves, you little pig.
[00:10:14.468 --> 00:10:15.328]  Don't you understand?
[00:10:15.468 --> 00:10:17.108]  Bow to me like King George III.
[00:10:17.188 --> 00:10:19.709]  Hold on one moment.
[00:10:20.129 --> 00:10:21.910]  Hold on, you stupid American rednecks.
[00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:23.431]  We'll get your firearms.
[00:10:23.791 --> 00:10:24.671]  I'm Piers Morgan.
[00:10:24.911 --> 00:10:35.435]  I put out on my Twitter that, yes, I'm a British supremacist, and I've come here to conquer you, you pathetic... Oh, the pathetic rural people in America with firearms.
[00:10:35.495 --> 00:10:35.855]  Hold on.
[00:10:39.019 --> 00:10:40.100]  I'm so elitist.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.840]  I'm so powerful.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:53.983]  All right, now let's shift gears to the really, really important news here, because we are dominating them on the web that for five, six years has been bigger than mainstream television and print put together.
[00:10:54.603 --> 00:11:01.305]  Mainstream media is not just dying right now on broadcast TV and cable.
[00:11:01.345 --> 00:11:02.485]  They're dying on the web.
[00:11:02.525 --> 00:11:03.985]  They're going bankrupt there as well.
[00:11:04.085 --> 00:11:05.586]  Alternative media is going boom.
[00:11:06.306 --> 00:11:07.106]  They're going boom.
[00:11:09.795 --> 00:11:11.616]  See, and so they are panicking.
[00:11:12.817 --> 00:11:19.140]  But don't just think because everybody hates them and nobody listens to them anymore that they're not dangerous, because they've still got the government and the megabanks behind them.
[00:11:20.201 --> 00:11:21.321]  And that's why they're so arrogant.
[00:11:21.621 --> 00:11:29.986]  So let's look at this perfect storm of dying dinosaur media and corporate whores and government circling the wagons against the alternative media that is destroying them.
[00:11:30.859 --> 00:11:34.260]  Aaron Dykes' InfoWars Facebook shut down.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.580]  Tens of thousands of followers.
[00:11:36.061 --> 00:11:38.741]  A whole bunch of sub-accounts we have just completely shut down.
[00:11:39.242 --> 00:11:43.683]  Our big one with 300 and something thousand likes suspended for now.
[00:11:44.723 --> 00:11:45.483]  And guess what?
[00:11:45.543 --> 00:11:46.904]  They're all being shut down for it.
[00:11:46.944 --> 00:11:47.604]  It's not just us.
[00:11:47.624 --> 00:11:48.664]  We're getting phone calls.
[00:11:49.004 --> 00:11:57.667]  It's hundreds of other pro-gun, libertarian, conservative, constitutional sites that had any pro-gun information.
[00:11:58.127 --> 00:11:59.708]  And as soon as I started covering this,
[00:12:00.788 --> 00:12:10.674]  I got a call from Mike Adams, the health ranger, who's going to be sitting in with us tomorrow on the radio, and he said, just like you, because he has a big account, the smaller accounts, they just get rid of them outright.
[00:12:11.034 --> 00:12:16.218]  They have suspended us, acting like they're doing due process before they fully ban the account.
[00:12:16.258 --> 00:12:17.699]  We've had this happen before.
[00:12:18.559 --> 00:12:21.661]  And they're saying, hey, you don't post anything pro-gun.
[00:12:22.201 --> 00:12:43.533]  Now, Mike Adams was sent this message, and Paul Watson has an article at Infowars.com, Facebook purges pro-gun accounts, and it's Gandhi, a famous quote from his own autobiography on page 446, among the many misdeeds of British rule in India, history will look upon the act of depriving a whole nation of arms as the blackest.
[00:12:44.013 --> 00:12:46.995]  And Gandhi was non-violent
[00:12:47.415 --> 00:12:49.676]  When people weren't killing you, he said.
[00:12:50.816 --> 00:12:53.837]  And you could be non-violent to illustrate they were in the wrong.
[00:12:54.117 --> 00:13:06.741]  But he said when you were being overwhelmingly physically attacked with lethal force, you can go pull up his quotes, this Gandhi on self-defense, that it wasn't just your right but your duty to defend yourself, echoing the Declaration of Independence.
[00:13:07.521 --> 00:13:16.743]  And so, the fact that he put out Gandhi, and the fact that we put out quotes about real homeland security as an armed citizenry, with an image of a woman with a revolver?
[00:13:17.263 --> 00:13:17.643]  Uh-uh!
[00:13:18.383 --> 00:13:22.204]  They want the gun culture dead, because it's been taking the Republic back.
[00:13:22.244 --> 00:13:28.406]  That's why they're banning three TV shows on Discovery, other top shows are being shut down, that were even finished and produced.
[00:13:28.966 --> 00:13:32.767]  That's why they're Cerberus, the biggest gun manufacturer, shutting down and selling out.
[00:13:33.567 --> 00:13:34.047]  That's why
[00:13:35.285 --> 00:13:42.992]  All of this is happening because this is the big push to kill the gun culture, because you can't be an enslaved New World Order colony if you've got guns.
[00:13:43.293 --> 00:13:54.123]  So there's that report, and again, here is that image that we've got up at Infowars.com for now of what they don't want to see you just from what NationalNews.com and Mike Adams put out.
[00:13:54.523 --> 00:13:55.945]  So understand, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:13:56.625 --> 00:14:03.109]  Under the new UN treaties and under the new cyber security acts, they can just go to your internet service provider and shut you down.
[00:14:03.149 --> 00:14:04.229]  Now they're saying they're going to do that.
[00:14:04.569 --> 00:14:06.030]  So it's Facebook today.
[00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:07.931]  It's everybody else tomorrow.
[00:14:08.532 --> 00:14:10.192]  See, the government uses Facebook.
[00:14:10.232 --> 00:14:21.659]  The globalists use Twitter to overthrow governments and put in Sharia law in the Middle East because they want to destabilize those countries like Egypt, Syria and Libya.
[00:14:22.439 --> 00:14:25.401]  So the globalists use it when they want to overthrow some country.
[00:14:26.249 --> 00:14:31.073]  But when we want to use it to get our Republic back, they're like, no, no, no.
[00:14:31.593 --> 00:14:33.795]  We use this to surveil and track you slaves.
[00:14:34.215 --> 00:14:35.096]  You don't use this.
[00:14:35.116 --> 00:14:37.177]  Remember the Navy SEALs a few months ago?
[00:14:37.798 --> 00:14:41.281]  They put out a thing pointing out that Navy SEALs needed help in Benghazi.
[00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:45.344]  And it just simply said, you know, we asked for help and didn't get it, Mr. President.
[00:14:45.644 --> 00:14:48.746]  It was a very popular site run by a bunch of retired Navy SEALs.
[00:14:49.167 --> 00:14:50.027]  They just shut it down.
[00:14:51.028 --> 00:14:52.049]  So again, you're veterans.
[00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:58.755]  Nice, wholesome, simple statement about, hey, we protect America, we asked for help, we didn't get it.
[00:14:59.156 --> 00:14:59.636]  You're banned.
[00:15:00.177 --> 00:15:04.561]  You put up something saying, hey, Gandhi said there was a right to be armed.
[00:15:05.302 --> 00:15:05.843]  You're banned.
[00:15:07.284 --> 00:15:09.907]  Some people, just all their work, everything they did, gone.
[00:15:11.048 --> 00:15:16.554]  So they use your content to promote and make money and put out pump and dump stock scams
[00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:21.454]  They even sent an email to Darren McBrain saying, don't have this stuff anymore.
[00:15:21.914 --> 00:15:24.276]  We have the quotes here in their letter, or we're going to ban you.
[00:15:24.577 --> 00:15:30.002]  So some people are just told, uh uh uh, it's not a way to make friends being political.
[00:15:30.282 --> 00:15:32.264]  You're not political in America.
[00:15:32.865 --> 00:15:34.327]  What do you think this is, America?
[00:15:34.367 --> 00:15:35.488]  This is North Korea.
[00:15:36.892 --> 00:15:40.395]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is just simply outrageous.
[00:15:40.715 --> 00:15:44.438]  You see, if they go after our second amendment, they're going to go after the first too.
[00:15:44.618 --> 00:15:46.359]  It all comes together.
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.581]  All right, so that's basically the facts on Piers Morgan.
[00:15:49.942 --> 00:16:02.471]  I didn't even cover it on my own radio show because of the Dianne Feinstein bills and others saying they're just going to completely ban guns, all semi-autos, make you physically turn them in, other guns to be registered, American gun owners to be fingerprinted.
[00:16:02.571 --> 00:16:02.991]  I mean, it's
[00:16:03.852 --> 00:16:04.893]  It's all off the charts.
[00:16:05.273 --> 00:16:07.514]  It's even freaking me out even though I knew it was coming.
[00:16:08.415 --> 00:16:14.659]  It is just unprecedented what's happening because the system's decided to drop the hammer.
[00:16:15.339 --> 00:16:22.344]  And they want to get a civil war going so that they can have a conflict with the American people and basically call anybody that doesn't submit to tyranny a terrorist.
[00:16:22.764 --> 00:16:25.246]  The Homeland Security System was always set up to take over America.
[00:16:25.266 --> 00:16:31.170]  It was always set up for libertarians, constitutionalists, true liberals in the sense of Thomas Jefferson.
[00:16:32.165 --> 00:16:33.666]  The mainline liberals are not liberals.
[00:16:33.906 --> 00:16:34.727]  They're authoritarians.
[00:16:34.947 --> 00:16:37.489]  And that's why the Republican establishment's going with them.
[00:16:37.789 --> 00:16:40.191]  Saying, hey, we'll do Obamacare written by insurance companies.
[00:16:40.471 --> 00:16:41.332]  Doubling your premiums.
[00:16:41.732 --> 00:16:42.432]  Total ripoff.
[00:16:42.472 --> 00:16:44.034]  Doesn't cover pre-existing stuff.
[00:16:44.974 --> 00:16:45.955]  Gets rid of charity care.
[00:16:46.856 --> 00:16:48.337]  Yeah, we'll go ahead and ban guns.
[00:16:48.537 --> 00:16:48.677]  Yeah.
[00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:58.358]  Because this is the time, because the foreign banks that own America through fraud, and the communist Chinese that own our debt, they're saying, hey, take the guns!
[00:16:58.398 --> 00:16:59.900]  Communist Chinese last week said that.
[00:17:00.581 --> 00:17:10.951]  And then we've got to sit here, no other country in the world would put up with a gaggle of foreigners and synthetic citizens up there telling us that we're slaves and going to turn our guns in.
[00:17:11.451 --> 00:17:14.533]  All right, that's it for this edition of InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:17:34.562 --> 00:17:36.864]  The good news is our listenership is exploding.
[00:17:36.884 --> 00:17:39.647]  We're getting a lot of new affiliates every single day.
[00:17:39.687 --> 00:17:42.730]  In fact, I've got a big list of them over here I covered on the radio today.

[00:17:57.845 --> 00:17:58.125]  Okay?
[00:17:58.626 --> 00:18:00.508]  Appreciate PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:18:00.828 --> 00:18:02.590]  Appreciate InfoWars.com.
[00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:06.033]  Appreciate us busting our butts here to get you this information.
[00:18:06.413 --> 00:18:09.456]  Not that I'm high and mighty and, hey, I'm really doing a good job.
[00:18:09.716 --> 00:18:10.837]  We're in a fight, folks.
[00:18:11.658 --> 00:18:16.182]  And we are fighting hard to get you this information warfare ammunition.
[00:18:16.602 --> 00:18:17.283]  So use it.
[00:18:17.503 --> 00:18:18.504]  The truth is powerful.
[00:18:18.564 --> 00:18:19.365]  It trumps lies.
[00:18:19.665 --> 00:18:22.348]  But you've got to face these globalists down.
[00:18:22.728 --> 00:18:26.349]  Michael Moore is not a liberal, he's an authoritarian pig with six bodyguards.
[00:18:26.369 --> 00:18:28.069]  One of them just got arrested with his gun at the airport.
[00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:31.110]  I've been roughed up by him, or they try to rough me up.
[00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:33.191]  Bumped into me, hit me, whatever, and I hit him back.
[00:18:33.851 --> 00:18:36.031]  It's all on video in a film, Martial Law.
[00:18:36.371 --> 00:18:43.753]  The point is, is that all of these people have their own bodyguards.
[00:18:43.893 --> 00:18:46.974]  Obama, David Gregory, all these pigs.
[00:18:47.748 --> 00:18:50.330]  These are authoritarians who want you disarmed.
[00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:51.211]  You're their food.
[00:18:51.591 --> 00:18:53.653]  You're their energy units they feed off of.
[00:18:54.073 --> 00:19:00.018]  They want a global government with 80 plus percent taxes, where you're taxed to the point where you're living in a 250 square foot box.
[00:19:00.359 --> 00:19:01.500]  That's Agenda 21.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.101]  This isn't a frickin' game.
[00:19:03.441 --> 00:19:05.043]  World government's being announced.
[00:19:06.212 --> 00:19:07.873]  So get aggressive now.
[00:19:08.973 --> 00:19:15.117]  Tomorrow night on the Friday edition, we're going to have a bunch of solutions and information warfare operations you can launch in your area.
[00:19:15.817 --> 00:19:19.459]  Alex Jones signing off for this edition of InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:19:19.939 --> 00:19:21.600]  Use this information while it's still here.
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.401]  We're trying to start a civil war.
[00:19:23.421 --> 00:19:25.502]  The path we're going on, we may not be here much longer.
