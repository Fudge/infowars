[00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:12.136]  George Bush became the hero of 9-11 simply due to the fact that he was the president and then ran through legislation that threatened our liberties as we all complacently stood by and allowed it to happen.
[00:00:28.027 --> 00:00:29.889]  A manufactured crisis occurs.
[00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:30.709]  Thesis.
[00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:37.035]  George Bush answers it by rallying public opinion and becoming the host of the tragedy.
[00:00:37.735 --> 00:00:38.516]  Antithesis.
[00:00:38.956 --> 00:00:41.619]  Thus owning the crisis through synthesis.
[00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:43.400]  Equilibrium is attained.
[00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:47.243]  All of the once separate parts of the plan are joined together.
[00:00:47.483 --> 00:00:54.850]  In this example, the Patriot Act acting as the equilibrium on the desired road to tyrannical fascism in America.
[00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.971]  They're too good at what they're doing.
[00:00:57.311 --> 00:00:59.092]  They create the crisis on record.
[00:00:59.132 --> 00:01:00.153]  They sell the fraud.
[00:01:00.433 --> 00:01:01.934]  Then they say, give us more power.
[00:01:02.214 --> 00:01:05.296]  Give up your sovereignty, Europe, America, and we'll fix it.
[00:01:05.336 --> 00:01:06.837]  But then it only implodes faster.
[00:01:07.198 --> 00:01:11.380]  They make bigger bonuses, but they're destroying their own golden goose.
[00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.001]  They're hacking it open greedily.
[00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:16.744]  When it's given them a golden egg every morning, they think there's eggs inside.
[00:01:17.904 --> 00:01:22.067]  I think the point you made is that they're on record creating this to consolidate power.
[00:01:22.127 --> 00:01:22.947]  They've bragged about it.
[00:01:24.108 --> 00:01:26.550]  Those memos have been made public by Goldman Sachs and others.
[00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.493]  But they're going to fry things so badly, the bankers are all running to private islands with their own security teams.
[00:01:32.553 --> 00:01:43.340]  I mean, they want to rule everything so much and have just so many digits in their bank accounts that they're going to devalue the value of the digits through their sheer greed.
[00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:45.432]  That is a possibility.
[00:01:45.612 --> 00:01:55.285]  And if you look at the Hegelian dialectic, if that crisis at the beginning spins out of control, they lose the tail end of the dialectic, don't they?
[00:01:56.827 --> 00:01:58.509]  There will be no synthesis at the end.
[00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:59.731]  They'll be lucky if they survive.
[00:02:00.276 --> 00:02:06.501]  Another method to manipulate the masses is the use of two opposing views to attain the desired view.
[00:02:06.762 --> 00:02:09.384]  Politician A espouses the first view.
[00:02:10.104 --> 00:02:12.706]  Politician B counters with a different view.
[00:02:13.147 --> 00:02:18.051]  A clear example of this was the debate over the unconstitutional NDAA Bill of 2012.
[00:02:19.452 --> 00:02:35.580]  I strongly believe that the United States government should not have the ability to lock away its citizens for years and perhaps decades without charging them and providing a heightened level of due process.
[00:02:37.202 --> 00:02:39.465]  We don't pick up citizens.
[00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:54.162]  We don't incarcerate them for 10 or 15 or 20 years or until hostilities end and no one knows when they will end without giving them due process of law.
[00:02:55.103 --> 00:03:06.848]  The great concern that we have now in terms of the security of the homeland is from so-called homegrown terrorists, radicalized Americans.
[00:03:07.628 --> 00:03:12.170]  So these people, in my opinion, have taken sides.
[00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:13.771]  They've joined the enemy.
[00:03:14.691 --> 00:03:37.547]  And to have this body, at this time, as the threat of homegrown terrorism rises, saying, no, they can't be treated as enemy combatants, not only doesn't make sense, and is totally unresponsive to the facts that I've just described,
[00:03:38.408 --> 00:03:49.326]  President Obama threatened to veto the bill as long as it contained the section concerning due process, and then quickly changed his mind before the final version was voted through Congress.
[00:03:50.558 --> 00:03:58.462]  Obama then told the media that the version he had signed was revised to eliminate any threat to freedom of American citizens.
[00:03:58.943 --> 00:04:13.690]  Even though this was not true, and the bill gives extraordinary powers to detain American citizens without a trial, the media synthesized Obama's lie by claiming that Obama will not use the powers he now has.
[00:04:14.351 --> 00:04:16.312]  The desired result is
[00:04:16.732 --> 00:04:17.272]  Infowarsmoneybomb.com!
[00:04:17.292 --> 00:04:18.353]  We just expanded next door!
[00:04:18.373 --> 00:04:19.773]  We're coming for the new world order!
[00:04:19.793 --> 00:04:20.273]  Get over here!
[00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:47.324]  It's InfoWars Money Bomb 2012.
[00:04:48.767 --> 00:04:50.670]  48 hours to change the world.
[00:04:53.977 --> 00:04:54.478]  Here's...
[00:04:56.027 --> 00:05:06.695]  Infowarsmoneybomb.com to read our mission and to see the amazing roster of guests we've got lined up sharing their insights on liberty and resistance to tyranny.
[00:05:06.975 --> 00:05:15.322]  I got involved in radio and TV as well as filmmaking 17 years ago because I didn't like the direction I saw our country and our world going in.
[00:05:15.762 --> 00:05:21.346]  The attacks on basic freedoms like the Second Amendment, the move towards collectivism in the nanny state.
[00:05:21.927 --> 00:05:24.309]  And over the last decade and a half,
[00:05:25.049 --> 00:05:33.756]  Infowars.com and my radio show and the films have become really part of the core resistance to tyranny worldwide.
[00:05:34.557 --> 00:05:49.649]  It seems like yesterday, but it was more than five years ago that I was sitting in my small office of about 3,000 square feet and realized that we were already reaching millions of people a week and that we had a responsibility to expand our operations in the face of the globalists.
[00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:55.114]  It was listeners five years ago that demanded we have a money bomb and expand our operations.
[00:05:56.015 --> 00:05:59.658]  We've gone from less than 10 crew members to more than 50 today.
[00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:03.102]  Five years ago, I was reaching about 3 million people a week.
[00:06:03.602 --> 00:06:05.764]  Now it's 15 million a week, conservatively.
[00:06:06.425 --> 00:06:13.652]  Imagine what will happen if you just tell one person a day about InfoWars.com or our news reports that are online.
[00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:26.168]  Imagine what will happen if you donate just five or ten dollars to InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com and allow us to go to the next level and put the nightly news out on free-to-air satellite worldwide.
[00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:28.851]  No, that one action won't save the world.
[00:06:29.512 --> 00:06:42.637]  But it will trigger brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere that will bring down the globalist and restore humanity on the right path of justice and liberty and a level playing field.
[00:06:42.877 --> 00:06:43.657]  We have a choice.
[00:06:43.837 --> 00:06:47.999]  The globalist dark age of control freak technocracy or
[00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:50.540]  1776 worldwide.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:58.704]  This October 18th and 19th, from Thursday morning right through into Saturday morning, it's InfoWars Money Bomb 2012.
[00:07:00.145 --> 00:07:01.726]  48 hours to change the world.
[00:07:02.106 --> 00:07:09.190]  I'll see you live with the free video and audio streams emanating from PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.372]  I'm Alex Jones, defending liberty, resisting tyranny.
[00:07:21.511 --> 00:07:27.575]  A decision is being made by the President and the Joint Chiefs in the War Room at the Pentagon.
[00:07:28.136 --> 00:07:34.580]  And when they realize there is no possibility of recalling the wing, there will be only one course of action.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.362]  Total commitment.
[00:07:37.142 --> 00:07:40.685]  Mandryk, do you recall what Clemenceau once said about war?
[00:07:40.705 --> 00:07:43.707]  No, I didn't think I knew what he was talking about.
[00:07:44.948 --> 00:07:47.589]  He said war was too important to be left to the generals.
[00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.852]  When he said that, 50 years ago,
[00:07:51.761 --> 00:07:52.602]  He might have been right.
[00:07:53.423 --> 00:07:57.507]  But today, war is too important to be left to politicians.
[00:07:58.448 --> 00:08:04.635]  They have neither the time, the training, nor the inclination for strategic thought.
[00:08:06.417 --> 00:08:09.901]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:08:10.501 --> 00:08:12.263]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.044 --> 00:08:38.070]  Welcome to Money Bomb, a two days to wake up the world.
[00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:42.295]  I'm Russell Dowdin for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Magazine.
[00:08:42.796 --> 00:08:46.080]  Yes, we are live bringing you right through 48 hours of constant
[00:08:48.649 --> 00:08:51.750]  Breaking through the lines of parody!
[00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:58.412]  Anyway, thank you so much guys, and thanks for that great report from Jakari and Matt Williams.
[00:08:58.832 --> 00:08:59.853]  They're on gun control.
[00:08:59.893 --> 00:09:03.934]  I'm Russell Dowden, again with Infowars.com and Infowars Magazine.
[00:09:04.834 --> 00:09:08.055]  What a great privilege it is to be here hosting this show tonight.
[00:09:08.555 --> 00:09:09.976]  Thank you folks for tuning in with us.
[00:09:09.996 --> 00:09:10.556]  We are live.
[00:09:10.576 --> 00:09:12.297]  It is now, you know, Friday the 19th.
[00:09:14.658 --> 00:09:15.879]  1 10 a.m.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:17.841]  Central Standard Time.
[00:09:17.881 --> 00:09:22.545]  Thank you so much for tuning in and being part of the broadcast tonight, guys, and sticking with us.
[00:09:23.306 --> 00:09:26.449]  You can help support the InfoWar and make a difference.
[00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:30.033]  Again, I want to remind folks of the phone numbers to call in.
[00:09:30.853 --> 00:09:31.734]  Our staff is here.
[00:09:32.855 --> 00:09:35.337]  Uh, taking your phone calls, if you'd like to make a donation, $10, $25, $50.
[00:09:36.338 --> 00:09:40.540]  Hey, maybe you want to buy the Obama Joker shirt.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:45.383]  We dug some of these up out of the vault, uh, yesterday, and Alex even autographed some of these.
[00:09:45.724 --> 00:09:46.945]  You might want to pick one of those up.
[00:09:47.425 --> 00:09:49.586]  Uh, phone lines are open, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, if you guys like to get a, uh,
[00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:55.870]  Sure.
[00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:57.932]  I don't know, maybe order a bundle of magazines.
[00:09:57.952 --> 00:10:01.054]  You know, we've got magazines, you know, we've got plenty of these available.
[00:10:01.074 --> 00:10:03.075]  We still can get some of these out for you guys.
[00:10:04.916 --> 00:10:10.200]  My guys are working hard right now in the back there working on issue number three.
[00:10:12.481 --> 00:10:12.721]  All right.
[00:10:12.741 --> 00:10:12.941]  Thank you.
[00:10:29.333 --> 00:10:30.655]  And spread the word out there.
[00:10:30.735 --> 00:10:36.383]  We have already generated, thanks to your support, over $100,000 this far in the process of the fundraising.
[00:10:36.403 --> 00:10:38.766]  So excellent support of you guys out there.
[00:10:46.718 --> 00:10:48.719]  Gotta say, man, what a thrill to be here.
[00:10:48.759 --> 00:10:50.200]  I've been a fan of Alex's.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.401]  I've known Alex for, gosh, about 12 years.
[00:10:52.821 --> 00:11:00.505]  You know, I used to publish Weird Magazine and do kind of a paranormal talk show many years ago on GCN Networks when I met new Alex.
[00:11:01.086 --> 00:11:06.629]  What a thrill it is to be here tonight and host this Money Bomb for you guys here live tonight.
[00:11:07.329 --> 00:11:08.150]  Keep the support going.
[00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:10.373]  Infomore's Money Bomb, our fifth year.
[00:11:10.413 --> 00:11:11.595]  Keep that stuff coming in, guys.
[00:11:11.835 --> 00:11:12.436]  Make your calls.
[00:11:12.736 --> 00:11:15.219]  We'll be taking phone calls later here in the broadcast.
[00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.082]  The number to call in again is 877-789-2539.
[00:11:17.102 --> 00:11:17.242]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:28.833]  I'd like to call in and talk with myself and our guest tonight.
[00:11:30.234 --> 00:11:37.698]  No stranger to this program, Phillip J. Berg, joining us from Pennsylvania on the Skype, I believe, tonight.
[00:11:37.878 --> 00:11:38.838]  And Phillip Berg,
[00:11:41.118 --> 00:11:43.721]  Author of Obamacrimes.com.
[00:11:43.801 --> 00:11:58.958]  Obamacrimes is the website for Phil Berg, Phillip J. Berg, Esquire, the first attorney who filed a lawsuit against Barack Obama on August 21st of 2008, challenging Obama's lack of constitutional eligibility.
[00:11:59.679 --> 00:12:02.140]  To actually even serve as President of the United States.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:12.962]  And the only way to really guarantee that Obama will not be President for a second term is to expose Obama for the fraud that he really is, the phony, the imposter.
[00:12:14.162 --> 00:12:18.923]  And Obama's put forth, you know, one of the greatest hoaxes in American history.
[00:12:19.443 --> 00:12:22.684]  And this right from Obamacrimes.com, in over 230 years, and the alleged
[00:12:26.585 --> 00:12:44.370]  Free press media, so-called media, has even refused to investigate this obvious, and public elected officials have just refused to even acknowledge what Philip Berg has tried to put forth to get this information out there, and why is that exactly?
[00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:55.832]  So we will ask Phil Berg these questions and many more, and take your phone calls again to call in 877-789-ALEX to call in and talk to our guest tonight here on the program.
[00:12:56.693 --> 00:12:58.713]  Welcome to the program, Phil Berg, how are you doing?
[00:12:59.353 --> 00:13:02.574]  Fine, it's my pleasure to be on your show.
[00:13:03.374 --> 00:13:05.595]  I too have known Alex for a number of years.
[00:13:07.575 --> 00:13:25.547]  I appreciate what he's doing and I hope everyone out there supports his efforts with this money bomb because it's essential that people like Alex Jones get spread around and can speak the truth of what's going on in this country because so many lies are put forth.
[00:13:26.167 --> 00:13:32.651]  The biggest lie as far as I'm concerned currently is the fact that Obama was born in Hawaii.
[00:13:32.931 --> 00:13:34.012]  It's so bad it's a joke.
[00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:41.059]  But the thing is it's detrimental to all of us because he really doesn't belong there.
[00:13:41.179 --> 00:13:44.442]  You really can't impeach him because he doesn't belong there.
[00:13:45.503 --> 00:13:47.305]  The only way to get him out is legally.
[00:13:47.325 --> 00:13:49.748]  I hope at the next effort
[00:13:51.109 --> 00:13:51.589]  That's right.
[00:14:08.536 --> 00:14:13.083]  This country for the last four years that has hurt us and really it has.
[00:14:13.864 --> 00:14:18.051]  If I can expose him, these things would have to be overturned, go down the drain.
[00:14:18.892 --> 00:14:22.498]  In addition to your money bomb, I've been requesting people to make contributions
[00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:40.540]  I'm shooting for a much higher number and people haven't done it, but if you can in addition to money bomb You know what match whatever you're giving to them to us We're trying to raise enough money to expose him by way of putting out a reward for the person who has the information
[00:14:41.201 --> 00:14:43.823]  Which will expose Obama because someone has it out there.
[00:14:44.363 --> 00:15:05.158]  I went to some big money people asking for two million dollars and it hasn't come through yet, but there's people out there that are spending so much money for Obama and on the other hand so much money for Romney that if they would put up a reward, I really think that someone has the information and he would be exposed and
[00:15:05.678 --> 00:15:09.901]  Can you just imagine if in the next three weeks we could expose him for what he really is?
[00:15:10.281 --> 00:15:11.822]  He would go down the drain big time.
[00:15:11.842 --> 00:15:13.243]  You know where Obama belongs right now?
[00:15:13.683 --> 00:15:15.104]  Not in the White House, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:15.124 --> 00:15:15.945]  You know where he belongs?
[00:15:16.105 --> 00:15:16.745]  The big house!
[00:15:17.105 --> 00:15:18.246]  He belongs in the big house.
[00:15:18.286 --> 00:15:22.288]  He belongs actually in prison because of what he has done to this country.
[00:15:22.949 --> 00:15:27.752]  He was born in Hawaii like I was born in Hawaii, and I was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
[00:15:28.632 --> 00:15:30.934]  We have on our website something from Sarah,
[00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:57.190]  Obama, and people said they've changed it, but we have a video of Sarah Obama with her, a pretty short video if not the audio, we have her words that were, she speaks in Swahili, and we had a minister here in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on the phone with one of his ministers in Africa, sitting next to Sarah Obama in her home in Kenya.
[00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:01.492]  And asked the question, where were you August 4th, 1961?
[00:16:01.992 --> 00:16:16.160]  And she states in Swahili, and it's translated, that she was in the hospital August 4th, 1961, where Obama was born in the hospital in Mombasa, Kenya.
[00:16:16.621 --> 00:16:18.222]  It's pretty hard to overcome that.
[00:16:18.662 --> 00:16:21.984]  But unfortunately, as you mentioned, the media has never done anything here.
[00:16:22.584 --> 00:16:25.045]  Remember what happened with the media with
[00:16:26.726 --> 00:16:27.027]  Yeah.
[00:16:43.096 --> 00:16:52.783]  It's a shame I think this country decided several years ago through the power brokers, it's not you and I, it's some of the money people, that Obama wanted a black president.
[00:16:53.864 --> 00:17:02.390]  I don't get, to me what I don't understand, Phil, is that this should be like the biggest story for Republicans to play off of here going into November with the elections.
[00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:06.894]  Why hasn't the Republican Party made this an issue here in 2012?
[00:17:06.994 --> 00:17:09.816]  Why wouldn't Romney
[00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:12.177]  Why did folks make this an issue here in 2012?
[00:17:12.617 --> 00:17:13.878]  Is this an issue that just died?
[00:17:14.118 --> 00:17:15.899]  Why is it suddenly a non-issue here in 2012?
[00:17:16.039 --> 00:17:18.561]  It doesn't make sense.
[00:17:18.701 --> 00:17:24.684]  The only thing I can think of, a lot of people come out first off and say, Hillary Clinton, why didn't she bring it out?
[00:17:24.704 --> 00:17:30.907]  And I think she didn't bring it out for the reason that, in my opinion, Obama probably had something on her or her husband.
[00:17:32.108 --> 00:17:32.689]  That's right.
[00:17:50.424 --> 00:17:52.745]  I blow that because I'm a lifelong Democrat.
[00:17:53.486 --> 00:17:54.726]  I'm still a registered Democrat.
[00:17:54.786 --> 00:17:57.207]  I ran for governor in Pennsylvania and also U.S.
[00:17:57.247 --> 00:17:59.208]  Senate in the primaries.
[00:17:59.468 --> 00:18:01.929]  The party people don't want me because I won't kiss their butts.
[00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:10.633]  Then many people on the air, I've been on probably 2,000 radio shows since 2008 when I started this, then people say, well, you're a racist.
[00:18:10.713 --> 00:18:11.314]  And I said, well,
[00:18:12.114 --> 00:18:18.738]  On radio, I said, you can't see me, I happen to be white, I happen to be Jewish, but I'm also a paid member of the NAACP.
[00:18:19.298 --> 00:18:23.601]  So they don't know what to do with someone like me, and they say, well, how can a Democrat sue a Democrat?
[00:18:24.121 --> 00:18:27.443]  And I say, well, the most important factor is the U.S.
[00:18:27.483 --> 00:18:28.264]  Constitution.
[00:18:28.844 --> 00:18:30.905]  That's more important than any political party.
[00:18:30.965 --> 00:18:32.426]  So they don't know what to do with me.
[00:18:32.486 --> 00:18:33.367]  I haven't gone away.
[00:18:33.407 --> 00:18:39.831]  I'm going to keep going if it takes five more years to expose this guy, because everyone around him belongs in jail at this point.
[00:18:40.171 --> 00:18:42.553]  Well, you know, Phil, that's really what the main issue here is.
[00:18:43.033 --> 00:18:47.576]  And the main issue should be is that if you're not a citizen, you can be president.
[00:18:48.357 --> 00:18:54.581]  And, you know, and years ago, I want to say about eight, seven, eight, nine years ago, Alex did the website.
[00:18:54.601 --> 00:18:58.684]  So here at InfoWars, we came up with a website, ArnoldExposed.com.
[00:18:59.244 --> 00:19:01.486]  And there was an old site, but
[00:19:02.126 --> 00:19:11.730]  It raised the same issue to expose Arnold for the crook he is and to emphasize that he wasn't born in the United States and he could not have a legitimate run for presidency.
[00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:19.434]  But that's the main issue here, Phil, is that if you're not born in the USA, as the Chief Marine Song says, then you can't run for president.
[00:19:19.674 --> 00:19:22.415]  And why haven't we seen a real birth certificate thus far?
[00:19:23.294 --> 00:19:36.042]  I don't know, but interesting on Arnold Schwarzenegger, before his current problem, which everyone knows what's going on, many times the last 10-15 years they asked him about running for president.
[00:19:36.202 --> 00:19:37.302]  What did he constantly say?
[00:19:37.703 --> 00:19:39.184]  He said, amend the Constitution.
[00:19:39.924 --> 00:19:42.527]  I mean, he admits the fact he wasn't born here in the United States.
[00:19:42.907 --> 00:19:43.948]  What does Obama do?
[00:19:44.089 --> 00:19:45.530]  Obama ignores it.
[00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:47.792]  Obama walks all over our Constitution.
[00:19:49.134 --> 00:19:50.235]  There's two issues here.
[00:19:50.375 --> 00:19:57.503]  Number one, I have no question if I had a million dollars I would even bet the fact that I'm right that he was born in Mombasa, Kenya, Africa.
[00:19:58.204 --> 00:19:59.004]  The next thing is,
[00:20:00.726 --> 00:20:09.153]  Even if he, listen carefully, even if he was born in Hawaii, which he wasn't, but let's say he was, his parents divorced when he was two or three years old.
[00:20:09.353 --> 00:20:10.554]  His mother remarries.
[00:20:11.115 --> 00:20:16.919]  She remarries a fellow named Lolo Sotoro, S-O-E-T-O-R-O, from Indonesia.
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.541]  And he goes to Indonesia with his mother.
[00:20:20.441 --> 00:20:22.643]  There's a law in the 1960s.
[00:20:23.243 --> 00:20:25.165]  There was problems in Indonesia.
[00:20:25.205 --> 00:20:25.905]  They were at war.
[00:20:26.346 --> 00:20:31.730]  The only ones who could go to school there were individuals that were natural born.
[00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:37.194]  Well, we knew he wasn't natural born, but it also said if he was adopted or acknowledged.
[00:20:37.794 --> 00:20:42.298]  By his stepfather, then he could be considered natural born.
[00:20:42.639 --> 00:20:43.920]  But we have the school record.
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:47.163]  The school record indicates his name is Barry Sotoro.
[00:20:47.643 --> 00:20:50.346]  It indicates that his nationality is Indonesia.
[00:20:50.766 --> 00:20:53.048]  And it indicates that his religion is Islam.
[00:20:53.829 --> 00:20:54.850]  Uh, which is Muslim.
[00:20:55.251 --> 00:20:56.573]  So, how do they get away with that?
[00:20:56.613 --> 00:20:59.035]  So even if he was a citizen, he gave up that.
[00:20:59.496 --> 00:21:08.186]  People then raise the question to me, well, how can a, uh, minor, uh, have his citizenship given up, you know, even if he was a citizen of the United States?
[00:21:08.206 --> 00:21:09.268]  I say, well, that's the law.
[00:21:10.009 --> 00:21:21.221]  And the thing is, between the ages of 18 and 21, he could have denounced his citizenship in Indonesia and reaffirmed his citizenship in the United States, if he had any.
[00:21:21.682 --> 00:21:24.185]  But there's nothing saying he did that.
[00:21:24.685 --> 00:21:31.546]  We believe at age 10, when he went back to Hawaii to live with his grandparents, that he used an Indonesia passport.
[00:21:31.966 --> 00:21:34.667]  And that follows up because at age 20, what does he do?
[00:21:34.707 --> 00:21:40.108]  See, a lot of the stuff he can't get away from because he put it in his books, which I don't think he wrote, but whoever wrote them.
[00:21:40.668 --> 00:21:44.229]  And at age 20, we know that he went to Pakistan.
[00:21:44.529 --> 00:21:47.209]  Well, citizens of the United States were forbidden to go to Pakistan.
[00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:50.670]  Yes, he did.
[00:22:07.139 --> 00:22:14.821]  Before everything got clamped down, someone did a Freedom of Information request, a FOIA request, to see Obama's passport.
[00:22:15.441 --> 00:22:20.963]  And it came, before he sealed records, it came back there's no such passport for Barack Obama.
[00:22:21.743 --> 00:22:23.023]  Well, it's been four years, Phil.
[00:22:23.063 --> 00:22:24.543]  I mean, it's been four whole years.
[00:22:25.024 --> 00:22:25.964]  I mean, this guy...
[00:22:27.064 --> 00:22:29.887]  There's been numerous birth certificates.
[00:22:30.267 --> 00:22:36.152]  I mean, there's a birth certificate, then there's not a birth certificate, then there's the Photoshop version of the birth certificate.
[00:22:36.813 --> 00:22:38.935]  I mean, how many of these documents are there?
[00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:40.811]  Well, but they're all fraud.
[00:22:40.871 --> 00:22:56.123]  I mean, the latest thing is, if we remember back about a year and a half ago, on April 27, 2011, Obama comes out, this is when Trump was after him, Obama comes out into the press room at the White House and says, here's my birth certificate.
[00:22:56.563 --> 00:22:58.765]  It was the latest false birth certificate.
[00:22:59.306 --> 00:23:04.450]  Experts around the world have all said there's more holes, my line is, there's more holes in that than Swiss cheese.
[00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:08.231]  But experts around the world have all said that was a phony.
[00:23:09.311 --> 00:23:11.352]  But the media hasn't gone after him.
[00:23:11.832 --> 00:23:14.833]  I think this would be a perfect time for the Republicans to go after him.
[00:23:15.493 --> 00:23:18.054]  But in a way, they don't want to get involved in the issue.
[00:23:18.114 --> 00:23:20.735]  But it looks like Romney's pulling ahead.
[00:23:20.755 --> 00:23:22.776]  I think Romney's going to win.
[00:23:23.116 --> 00:23:24.376]  But my efforts will continue.
[00:23:24.516 --> 00:23:26.297]  I believe everyone around Obama.
[00:23:26.837 --> 00:23:35.142]  And I'm talking his wife, I'm talking his campaign staff, I'm talking Howard Dean, I'm talking who was the head of the Democratic National Committee.
[00:23:35.562 --> 00:23:39.885]  Thank you for bringing up the date that I filed suit August in 2008.
[00:23:40.365 --> 00:23:43.687]  We sued Obama and we sued the Democratic National Committee.
[00:23:44.587 --> 00:23:45.988]  And why did I sue both of them?
[00:23:46.248 --> 00:23:50.251]  I thought, wrongly, I thought if we had a true, honest
[00:23:51.223 --> 00:24:02.505]  Well, being the good Democrat that you are, Phil, you thought that there might be some justice on the Democratic Party, but are they conspiring this information knowingly?
[00:24:03.305 --> 00:24:12.548]  Well, I think what happened is I expected them to call Obama in the room and tell Obama that, listen, you know, if you're not natural born, you're not even getting nominated.
[00:24:13.008 --> 00:24:20.471]  But obviously what happened, I didn't hear from the DNC about a month later when they had to file some kind of papers in federal court.
[00:24:20.811 --> 00:24:24.532]  It was a joint paper between the Democratic National Committee and Obama.
[00:24:24.832 --> 00:24:26.412]  So I knew at that point it was a fraud.
[00:24:26.452 --> 00:24:27.473]  They were in bed together.
[00:24:28.353 --> 00:24:29.613]  Howard Dean just
[00:24:31.514 --> 00:24:31.654]  Yeah.
[00:24:51.091 --> 00:24:52.832]  Remind some and new for other listeners.
[00:24:52.892 --> 00:24:59.417]  I filed four applications for injunctions, again, to the United States Supreme Court.
[00:24:59.857 --> 00:25:01.678]  And they would not deal with each one.
[00:25:01.758 --> 00:25:03.399]  I tried to delay the election.
[00:25:03.419 --> 00:25:04.000]  Well, exactly.
[00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:06.481]  Phil, what are some of the charges?
[00:25:06.862 --> 00:25:09.123]  What's the main charge you would want to bring him up on right now?
[00:25:09.143 --> 00:25:10.924]  The main charge is he's a fraud.
[00:25:11.125 --> 00:25:11.725]  He's a phony.
[00:25:11.805 --> 00:25:13.446]  I mean, he's... Also, think back.
[00:25:14.006 --> 00:25:18.349]  There's many people who remember him from going to school in California at Occidental.
[00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:20.171]  They remember calling him Barry.
[00:25:21.011 --> 00:25:24.092]  I think his legal name today is Barry Soturo.
[00:25:24.593 --> 00:25:28.734]  You can use an alias, but not for fraudulent purposes.
[00:25:29.094 --> 00:25:30.855]  And he's using it for fraudulent purposes.
[00:25:31.275 --> 00:25:32.936]  I mean, there's so many charges it could go.
[00:25:33.176 --> 00:25:37.258]  But the biggest thing is, he has no right to be a president because he's not natural born.
[00:25:37.298 --> 00:25:38.858]  Now let me back up on that for a minute.
[00:25:40.259 --> 00:25:46.325]  For your listeners out there, if you have husband and wife, boyfriend and girlfriend, whatever the relationship, and both are U.S.
[00:25:46.345 --> 00:25:56.394]  citizens traveling any place in the world, and if they have a child any place in the world outside of the United States, when that child comes back through immigration, that child is considered natural born.
[00:25:56.894 --> 00:25:57.254]  Okay?
[00:25:57.434 --> 00:25:57.575]  Right.
[00:25:57.615 --> 00:26:00.637]  But in the case of when only one parent is a U.S.
[00:26:00.677 --> 00:26:03.760]  citizen, you have to go by the law in effect at that time.
[00:26:04.301 --> 00:26:05.482]  Well, the law in effect
[00:26:06.719 --> 00:26:13.046]  In 1961, and it's set by Congress, it's set by the Senate, okay, stated that if only one parent is a U.S.
[00:26:13.066 --> 00:26:19.232]  citizen, to convey natural-born status, that parent would have lived in the United States for ten straight years.
[00:26:19.552 --> 00:26:20.353]  His mother did.
[00:26:20.853 --> 00:26:22.835]  However, there's another requirement that
[00:26:23.776 --> 00:26:28.038]  Five of those years had to be after the age of fourteen.
[00:26:28.639 --> 00:26:30.219]  Fourteen and five is nineteen.
[00:26:30.399 --> 00:26:36.262]  She was only eighteen, so she could not have conveyed natural-born citizenship when he was born in Africa.
[00:26:36.742 --> 00:26:38.663]  Some people say, oh, that's a technicality.
[00:26:39.003 --> 00:26:40.184]  It's not a technicality.
[00:26:40.264 --> 00:26:40.884]  It's the law.
[00:26:41.185 --> 00:26:43.766]  Like right now, I think the law is fifteen plus two years.
[00:26:44.206 --> 00:26:45.787]  But Congress sets that law.
[00:26:45.927 --> 00:26:46.707]  The law was there.
[00:26:47.247 --> 00:26:48.388]  And he violated it.
[00:26:48.488 --> 00:26:49.989]  But more important, he knows
[00:26:50.649 --> 00:26:51.249]  He's a fraud.
[00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:56.633]  When you ever see Obama or Michelle Obama laughing, you know who they're laughing at?
[00:26:56.933 --> 00:27:03.577]  They're laughing at the over 300 million people in this country because they know they're a fraud, they know they're funny.
[00:27:03.677 --> 00:27:04.417]  They're using this.
[00:27:04.477 --> 00:27:12.402]  I mean, last year, were you one of her good friends that she took about 40 friends over to Europe for a little vacation?
[00:27:12.482 --> 00:27:14.223]  Yeah, I heard about it.
[00:27:14.443 --> 00:27:15.143]  Millions of dollars.
[00:27:15.183 --> 00:27:22.686]  Well, because they're taking advantage, and right now there's word that if he loses, they're buying him an $8 million estate.
[00:27:22.906 --> 00:27:32.450]  Well, Phil, what are some of the cover-ups, just to interject a little, what are some of the types of cover-ups that have occurred since the probe into the investigation for the birth certificate?
[00:27:34.704 --> 00:27:36.086]  There's been so many lawsuits.
[00:27:36.867 --> 00:27:45.817]  The big thing is the courts have stated basically we don't have, we were the first one and the other suits have followed suit, that we don't have standing to bring an action.
[00:27:46.898 --> 00:27:50.662]  Which is absurd because everyone in this country should have standing.
[00:27:51.283 --> 00:27:53.765]  Because we're all affected by the president.
[00:27:54.605 --> 00:27:56.566]  The big cover-up is where he was born.
[00:27:56.586 --> 00:27:58.708]  I mean, that could be straightened out very easily.
[00:27:59.248 --> 00:28:03.871]  If any court would grant us discovery, Obama would be out of office in one week.
[00:28:04.291 --> 00:28:05.952]  Because he couldn't withstand that.
[00:28:06.333 --> 00:28:12.036]  I've said to Obama, prove me wrong, show me wrong, and I'll withdraw my lawsuits, and I'll go away.
[00:28:12.516 --> 00:28:14.698]  He never did that, because he can't do that.
[00:28:15.418 --> 00:28:18.900]  One of my cases was, I said he was a fraud when he was a U.S.
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:19.321]  Senator.
[00:28:20.456 --> 00:28:24.681]  Um, and we had this, uh, action we brought, we say, see U.S.
[00:28:24.721 --> 00:28:34.772]  Senator, you don't have to be, excuse me, you don't have to be a citizen of the, you don't have to be natural born, but he's fraud because of the information he's given.
[00:28:36.494 --> 00:28:37.234]  Where did he come from?
[00:28:37.254 --> 00:28:38.275]  I mean, think about this.
[00:28:38.815 --> 00:28:43.036]  All of a sudden, he's two years Occidental, then he goes to Columbia University in New York.
[00:28:43.556 --> 00:28:50.658]  Someone taking the exact same program that he supposedly took, with the pre-law and everything else, would have been sitting next to him.
[00:28:51.259 --> 00:28:56.840]  Doesn't remember ever seeing Obama, meeting Obama, or never seeing him in any class.
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:57.961]  It just doesn't make sense.
[00:28:58.321 --> 00:28:59.401]  Then he goes to Harvard.
[00:29:00.081 --> 00:29:03.302]  He becomes head of the Law Review, but he never wrote an article.
[00:29:03.863 --> 00:29:04.203]  I mean... Yeah.
[00:29:05.723 --> 00:29:16.491]  It's just, if you look at it... Well, what amazes me, Phil, is just the sheer push for this guy to get into office in 2007.
[00:29:18.792 --> 00:29:26.337]  You go back to 2007 and how the media just worshipped him and flooded in for this guy to get in office.
[00:29:27.638 --> 00:29:34.823]  It's just surreal to me how the push for him, who's always the savior and all of this,
[00:29:35.283 --> 00:29:41.408]  You know, to bring him in, but we just haven't heard a whole lot about the birth certificate in the last few years.
[00:29:41.448 --> 00:29:45.350]  And I don't know why, why the Republican Party is not bringing this up.
[00:29:46.631 --> 00:29:52.336]  This is a non-issue for Republicans right now as he's going in to vote as we're going into November this year.
[00:29:52.396 --> 00:29:55.878]  I just, I can't, I cannot, it fathoms me.
[00:29:55.918 --> 00:29:56.739]  I can't even believe it.
[00:29:57.435 --> 00:30:03.762]  This would be a perfect time for the Republicans to bring it up because by exposing him right now, he would go down the drain.
[00:30:03.842 --> 00:30:06.745]  It wouldn't give the party time enough to even substitute a candidate.
[00:30:07.346 --> 00:30:12.551]  Even if they could, I think the Democratic Party would be so destroyed by this.
[00:30:12.591 --> 00:30:15.875]  So it's a perfect time now for someone to come forth.
[00:30:16.436 --> 00:30:17.817]  You can give me your name or not.
[00:30:17.937 --> 00:30:19.439]  Send me the documentation.
[00:30:19.619 --> 00:30:20.920]  Which proves that I'm right.
[00:30:21.661 --> 00:30:22.883]  And I'm not trying to say I'm right.
[00:30:22.903 --> 00:30:25.485]  There's many other lawyers and other individuals that have pushed this.
[00:30:26.386 --> 00:30:29.610]  Alex did a great job on this thing for the past four years.
[00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:30.831]  But he's a fraud!
[00:30:31.452 --> 00:30:36.998]  Bring forth the information to me, Phil Berg, and get me, as you stated, on Obamacrimes.com.
[00:30:37.018 --> 00:30:40.762]  That's O-B-A-M-A-C-R-I-M-E-S dot C-O-M.
[00:30:40.782 --> 00:30:41.623]  Obamacrimes.com.
[00:30:41.943 --> 00:30:43.484]  Obamacrimes.com, folks.
[00:30:43.524 --> 00:30:46.286]  Be sure to check out the work of Phil.
[00:30:47.307 --> 00:30:48.508]  Support him if you can.
[00:30:48.528 --> 00:30:50.129]  Obamacrimes.com.
[00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:54.712]  Now, I want to throw out the phone number there, Phil, because I'd like to take some calls, see what folks think of this.
[00:30:55.053 --> 00:30:58.495]  The controversial issue, because, I mean, we've had you on before on this program.
[00:30:59.136 --> 00:31:01.898]  I've even interviewed you once before on some of my previous radio programs.
[00:31:02.158 --> 00:31:05.080]  If you'd like to chime in on this, again, the number to call in tonight is 877-789-2539.
[00:31:10.524 --> 00:31:14.249]  Seven, eight, nine, Alex, if you'd like to call in and, uh, what do you think of this?
[00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:16.693]  What do you, what do you, uh, what do you make of it yourself?
[00:31:16.713 --> 00:31:19.697]  Uh, if you're, if you're listening in, uh, give us a call.
[00:31:19.737 --> 00:31:21.480]  We'd like to, to get your thoughts on this.
[00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:24.724]  And then I got to ask you to, uh, on this, Phil, um...
[00:31:25.948 --> 00:31:27.648]  Have you seen this Joel Gilbert film?
[00:31:27.688 --> 00:31:29.429]  We sell this film in our store.
[00:31:29.449 --> 00:31:31.129]  It's called Dreams of My Real Father.
[00:31:31.689 --> 00:31:40.372]  What are your thoughts on this whole Frank Marshall Davis issue as the real father and the CIA connection to his supposed father-in-law or father?
[00:31:40.952 --> 00:31:47.133]  What is Philip J. Berg's thoughts on this whole Joel Gilbert slant on this Dreams of My Real Father?
[00:31:47.153 --> 00:31:48.334]  Because that's something I'm curious.
[00:31:48.374 --> 00:31:52.495]  I've heard your sides for impeachment and your side on this, but what is
[00:31:53.695 --> 00:31:58.039]  Phil Berg's thought of this Joel Gilbert's film, I'm sure you're familiar with it, Dreams of My Real Father.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.423]  Yeah, I am and I'm not sure.
[00:32:01.983 --> 00:32:06.808]  The thing is, I've tried to stay straight on the fact that everything about him is a phony.
[00:32:07.388 --> 00:32:13.314]  And to start going off to someone else being his father, I don't think we have to go that way.
[00:32:13.374 --> 00:32:16.337]  But I respect any way people are pushing.
[00:32:17.038 --> 00:32:17.819]  I haven't seen yet.
[00:32:18.699 --> 00:32:22.202]  That movie 2016 that Tommy has a lot of exposure around the country.
[00:32:22.622 --> 00:32:27.005]  Anything that can open the door on Obama to show what he truly is.
[00:32:27.385 --> 00:32:28.706]  He truly is a phony.
[00:32:28.786 --> 00:32:29.527]  He's a fraud.
[00:32:30.267 --> 00:32:34.390]  And the biggest thing is this is the biggest hoax against the United States of America in our history.
[00:32:34.831 --> 00:32:36.892]  So listeners out there, wake up!
[00:32:37.332 --> 00:32:39.514]  Tell your friends to go to my website.
[00:32:39.534 --> 00:32:40.755]  You can read everything about this.
[00:32:40.815 --> 00:32:42.096]  Every pleading, everything's there.
[00:32:43.897 --> 00:32:46.199]  I know that he is a fraud.
[00:32:46.859 --> 00:32:48.320]  I mean, I could do anything on that.
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.742]  People say, well, how can you say that against the president?
[00:32:50.782 --> 00:32:52.583]  Well, he doesn't belong as the president.
[00:32:52.824 --> 00:32:53.584]  He shouldn't be there.
[00:32:54.545 --> 00:32:56.967]  People say about, are you concerned about your safety?
[00:32:57.407 --> 00:33:01.630]  And I say no, because the biggest reason I'll say why I'm not worried about my safety
[00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:06.472]  Is because if something would happen to me, it would take this story from the back page to the front page.
[00:33:06.933 --> 00:33:09.254]  And I think that's why they've left me alone.
[00:33:09.754 --> 00:33:17.338]  I think the big reason this is going on, there's people like George Soros and other money people in this country that control the press.
[00:33:18.038 --> 00:33:21.721]  You know, unfortunately, we don't have a free press.
[00:33:21.821 --> 00:33:34.530]  I laughed when Richard Nixon was talking, either Richard Nixon or George Bush, I'm sorry, one of them was talking about the free press, I think it was George Bush, talking about the free press in Russia, questioning the free press in Russia.
[00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:36.972]  Hey, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
[00:33:37.412 --> 00:33:40.334]  Question the free press in this country because there's no free press here.
[00:33:40.374 --> 00:33:50.402]  That's why it's so important to work on this money bomb so that Alex can continue his efforts to spread the news, the real news around the world.
[00:33:50.622 --> 00:33:54.785]  I mean, look what's going on right now regarding this thing with Libya.
[00:33:55.245 --> 00:33:57.627]  You know, our ambassador was killed.
[00:33:57.927 --> 00:33:58.768]  He was murdered.
[00:33:59.288 --> 00:34:10.238]  And the administration was playing Patsy with all of us by denying it, by sending Mr. Reitz, the ambassador to the United Nations, on every talk show on that coming Sunday.
[00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:12.940]  And what happened there?
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:16.222]  You know, now they're trying to double talk that he said it the next day in the Rose Garden.
[00:34:16.242 --> 00:34:21.986]  Well, that's what we're getting these days now is it's the mainstream media in this country is the old Soviet Union Pravda.
[00:34:23.347 --> 00:34:37.377]  We've taken lessons from the Russians and the propaganda machine of the Cold War and it seems that the United States has now learned from Goebbels and the Germans and the Russians and now, you know,
[00:34:37.778 --> 00:34:40.386]  That's why it's important guys to get involved with this money bomb.
[00:34:41.168 --> 00:34:42.492]  Two days to wake up the world.
[00:34:42.853 --> 00:34:44.538]  Infowarsmoneybomb.com
[00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:52.913]  Support the InfoWars, support Alex Jones, support this network so we can do these types of things and bring this information to you.
[00:34:53.113 --> 00:34:55.334]  Who else is going to have Philip J. Berg on, guys?
[00:34:55.794 --> 00:35:01.697]  Who else is going to put this type of information on for you to learn about this?
[00:35:01.997 --> 00:35:04.979]  Because obviously the Republican Party's not even taking this.
[00:35:05.139 --> 00:35:06.479]  This is a non-issue, Phil.
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:08.600]  Why are the Republicans not talking about this?
[00:35:08.901 --> 00:35:09.521]  I can't believe it.
[00:35:10.001 --> 00:35:10.662]  I can't either.
[00:35:10.722 --> 00:35:13.046]  I mean, I think it would put the issue over the top.
[00:35:13.086 --> 00:35:16.310]  I think it would definitely make Romney run away with it.
[00:35:17.292 --> 00:35:21.979]  If Obama's in for a second term, we're in real trouble in this country.
[00:35:22.019 --> 00:35:26.044]  Well, sure we are, and you call less of the two evils, but I mean...
[00:35:27.799 --> 00:35:36.042]  Romney, I'm not even a fan of Romney, but the point is, is that, you know, we don't have a birth certificate issue with Romney.
[00:35:36.462 --> 00:35:38.543]  Okay, now Romney's Mormon, fine!
[00:35:38.923 --> 00:35:40.144]  Mormon's Mormons, you know?
[00:35:40.484 --> 00:35:46.026]  But, I mean, I don't know, it's just, it's just, I can't believe that the political party hasn't taken advantage of this.
[00:35:46.246 --> 00:35:48.147]  You want to call in and chime in on this with us tonight?
[00:35:48.347 --> 00:35:48.927]  Again, the number is 877-789-...
[00:35:50.988 --> 00:35:59.013]  Alex, 877-789-2539, if you'd like to maybe open up the phone lines, maybe we can get a call in and chime in on this.
[00:35:59.233 --> 00:36:03.175]  What has been your biggest obstacle, Phil, on raising money for this issue?
[00:36:03.815 --> 00:36:04.676]  Well, two things.
[00:36:04.736 --> 00:36:06.637]  First off, please anyone, call in.
[00:36:06.837 --> 00:36:08.878]  I will answer any question at any time.
[00:36:08.998 --> 00:36:10.119]  I will not duck the issue.
[00:36:10.519 --> 00:36:11.219]  I'll speak about it.
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:14.081]  The biggest problem is the courts have said we don't have standing.
[00:36:14.781 --> 00:36:19.682]  And, like I say, I've filed suit here in the Eastern Federal Court in Philadelphia.
[00:36:20.062 --> 00:36:23.143]  I've filed a lawsuit in the Federal Court in Washington, D.C.
[00:36:24.724 --> 00:36:28.485]  I have filed in the state court system in Pennsylvania.
[00:36:28.825 --> 00:36:30.545]  I've tried and tried and tried.
[00:36:30.585 --> 00:36:32.265]  The courts could have said, we don't have standing.
[00:36:32.606 --> 00:36:35.126]  Which is, think about it, ladies and gentlemen, it's outrageous.
[00:36:35.666 --> 00:36:36.427]  We don't have standing.
[00:36:36.747 --> 00:36:37.907]  You know, they say we're not injured.
[00:36:39.042 --> 00:36:41.343]  We're all injured by someone who's a fraud.
[00:36:41.803 --> 00:36:42.303]  And you know what?
[00:36:42.563 --> 00:36:44.224]  We're the laughingstock of the world.
[00:36:44.504 --> 00:36:48.885]  Because people around the world all know that he was born in Kenya.
[00:36:49.285 --> 00:36:50.666]  I mean, this is like a joke.
[00:36:51.146 --> 00:36:52.406]  And it's a sad joke.
[00:36:52.806 --> 00:36:56.708]  You know, and think about the things he did when he first got into office.
[00:36:56.728 --> 00:37:00.009]  He went around the world apologizing for the United States of America.
[00:37:00.669 --> 00:37:01.710]  What other president did that?
[00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:02.710]  Nobody.
[00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:04.871]  He bowed down to the sordid king.
[00:37:05.111 --> 00:37:06.792]  He bowed down to the emperor of Japan.
[00:37:06.972 --> 00:37:08.433]  He bowed down to the leader of China.
[00:37:08.853 --> 00:37:10.174]  What other president has done that?
[00:37:10.194 --> 00:37:11.775]  Well, it's because he's Muslim!
[00:37:12.355 --> 00:37:13.075]  Absolutely, he is.
[00:37:13.135 --> 00:37:14.536]  He's Muslim is what he is!
[00:37:14.576 --> 00:37:17.298]  Let's go to Kim in Georgia and get your phone calls in here.
[00:37:17.318 --> 00:37:18.298]  Let's get a couple of calls in.
[00:37:18.518 --> 00:37:20.379]  Kim in Georgia, you're on the air with Philip J. Berg.
[00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:23.481]  Yes, thank you for taking my call.
[00:37:23.721 --> 00:37:25.742]  I've been listening for a while.
[00:37:25.762 --> 00:37:27.323]  I've been listening on my iPhone app.
[00:37:28.123 --> 00:37:29.524]  I contributed to Monty Bomb.
[00:37:30.453 --> 00:37:33.074]  What was the first part?
[00:37:33.094 --> 00:37:33.835]  Walking all over?
[00:37:33.855 --> 00:37:34.475]  What did you say?
[00:37:34.495 --> 00:37:34.955]  I'm sorry.
[00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:53.263]  Isn't there something in the U.S.
[00:37:53.323 --> 00:37:58.655]  Code about the President can't hold more than one seat at the same time?
[00:37:58.675 --> 00:38:00.940]  I mean, he's sitting in a chair.
[00:38:02.569 --> 00:38:02.829]  U.S.
[00:38:02.869 --> 00:38:03.850]  Security Council.
[00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:04.890]  Does that count?
[00:38:05.471 --> 00:38:06.051]  Absolutely.
[00:38:06.151 --> 00:38:10.854]  I mean, but see, the thing is with Obama, he doesn't care about the Constitution.
[00:38:10.874 --> 00:38:11.794]  He doesn't care about anything.
[00:38:12.254 --> 00:38:13.315]  He just does what he wants.
[00:38:13.395 --> 00:38:16.297]  I mean, that's one great position, what you're stating.
[00:38:16.337 --> 00:38:17.597]  That's illegal, what he did there.
[00:38:17.937 --> 00:38:21.720]  There's just so many things that he has done by legislation.
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.461]  If it doesn't pass, he has another executive order.
[00:38:25.221 --> 00:38:27.683]  He's got more, I'm trying to think of the right word,
[00:38:28.463 --> 00:38:31.385]  His people in the White House that are not confirmed.
[00:38:32.366 --> 00:38:33.787]  Russell, you'll come up with that for me.
[00:38:34.167 --> 00:38:36.809]  Let's go to another caller in Hawaii.
[00:38:36.909 --> 00:38:38.250]  I can't make up the name there.
[00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:40.211]  Tiffany, is that right?
[00:38:40.851 --> 00:38:42.473]  Infinite in Hawaii.
[00:38:42.573 --> 00:38:43.453]  Let's see.
[00:38:43.553 --> 00:38:45.134]  The home place of Obama.
[00:38:46.075 --> 00:38:46.495]  Ah, yes.
[00:38:46.775 --> 00:38:48.296]  That's what I'm calling.
[00:38:48.557 --> 00:38:49.097]  Exactly.
[00:38:49.117 --> 00:38:50.738]  It doesn't matter.
[00:38:50.838 --> 00:38:52.619]  It doesn't matter if he's born in Kenya or not.
[00:38:54.591 --> 00:38:58.496]  Really, Hawaii is a sovereign state, and it's illegally occupied.
[00:38:58.516 --> 00:39:07.387]  And if you go look at the international laws, actually we have, in the University of Hawaii system, we have a bunch of people actually pursuing this.
[00:39:09.165 --> 00:39:09.546]  Uh, yeah.
[00:39:10.326 --> 00:39:11.687]  So, forget about Kenya.
[00:39:11.968 --> 00:39:13.889]  I mean, let him say he's born in Hawaii.
[00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:15.130]  It doesn't matter.
[00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:16.111]  It's still illegal.
[00:39:16.592 --> 00:39:19.394]  So you believe he's not born in Hawaii?
[00:39:20.395 --> 00:39:21.075]  No, it doesn't matter.
[00:39:21.095 --> 00:39:23.277]  I'm saying let him say it.
[00:39:23.337 --> 00:39:29.102]  I mean, you could say he's born in Hawaii, but he's... Hawaii is illegally occupied by America right now.
[00:39:29.823 --> 00:39:31.904]  And news is coming out about that.
[00:39:31.924 --> 00:39:33.426]  Do you have a question for Phil Berg?
[00:39:34.532 --> 00:39:48.404]  Yes, look up HawaiianKingdom.org, check out the videos, check out Keanu's dissertation, and become aware of what the truth is about the sovereignty of this state.
[00:39:48.424 --> 00:39:57.552]  Because if Obama is born in Hawaii, and this is the case, and these facts are right, then he's a natural born, he cannot be president.
[00:39:59.675 --> 00:40:00.156]  Great point.
[00:40:00.216 --> 00:40:01.377]  I will check that.
[00:40:02.218 --> 00:40:07.222]  And you're calling from Hawaii and you're saying he basically doesn't belong in office.
[00:40:08.343 --> 00:40:09.584]  I appreciate your comments here.
[00:40:09.604 --> 00:40:11.886]  I'll check out the HawaiianKingdom.com.
[00:40:12.607 --> 00:40:20.633]  But everyone out there around the world, whatever thoughts you have, if you can't get through on a phone call tonight, send it to our website, you know, Obamacrimes.com.
[00:40:21.374 --> 00:40:24.996]  We'll be glad to look into it, because I will do everything in my power.
[00:40:26.376 --> 00:40:31.719]  Hopefully he'll be defeated, and I will still go after him, because everything he's passed is illegal.
[00:40:31.779 --> 00:40:33.100]  Everything he's done is illegal.
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:40.403]  And what kind of example are we setting for our children and our grandchildren in this country to have a fraud in there as president?
[00:40:40.423 --> 00:40:41.424]  So, great issue.
[00:40:41.444 --> 00:40:42.504]  I appreciate your support.
[00:40:42.904 --> 00:40:43.545]  Exactly.
[00:40:43.785 --> 00:40:44.225]  Exactly.
[00:40:44.345 --> 00:40:45.466]  Alfred in California.
[00:40:45.486 --> 00:40:46.926]  Let's go to Alfred in California.
[00:40:46.946 --> 00:40:47.567]  You're on the air.
[00:40:47.587 --> 00:40:49.627]  Yeah, how you guys doing?
[00:40:49.728 --> 00:40:50.428]  How you doing, Alfred?
[00:40:51.454 --> 00:40:54.777]  Good, and well, I actually had two part questions.
[00:40:54.797 --> 00:41:16.834]  The first part is, um, recently I've been talking with my girlfriend and stuff, and she has been arguing one part of her side of saying that she's actually learning part, and I actually remember part of it, that you actually learn in school that if you're born, uh, if you're an immigrant from a different state and you're here for so long, you can actually be a president.
[00:41:16.874 --> 00:41:18.375]  Can you go in clarification with that?
[00:41:19.226 --> 00:41:19.846]  Well, you can.
[00:41:19.886 --> 00:41:24.789]  I mean, it depends the law in existence at that time.
[00:41:24.809 --> 00:41:29.451]  If an immigrant comes in and both parents were not U.S.
[00:41:29.471 --> 00:41:31.472]  citizens, you can't be...
[00:41:33.118 --> 00:41:36.600]  You can't be qualified to be President of the United States.
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:38.141]  It's just the law is set out.
[00:41:38.241 --> 00:41:39.962]  Like I said, if both parents are U.S.
[00:41:40.002 --> 00:41:46.165]  citizens and the child is born any place in the world, and the child comes back, that child can be natural born.
[00:41:46.606 --> 00:41:54.650]  When an individual comes in here who's not, doesn't meet that, they can become naturalized, but not natural born and they cannot be President.
[00:41:55.791 --> 00:41:58.712]  You said you had a second question.
[00:41:59.033 --> 00:41:59.513]  Why is that?
[00:42:00.779 --> 00:42:02.642]  You said you had a second question.
[00:42:02.662 --> 00:42:04.665]  Second point, Alfred?
[00:42:04.745 --> 00:42:09.872]  Second point is, how is Obama getting away with defraudulizing?
[00:42:12.225 --> 00:42:15.668]  Uh, this Constitution and what our forefathers set for us.
[00:42:15.728 --> 00:42:24.396]  Like, how is it possible that he can do so much tyranny to us and get away with all of this and set laws and people are not standing up and fighting for it?
[00:42:24.696 --> 00:42:25.437]  Thanks for your call.
[00:42:25.477 --> 00:42:26.397]  Thanks for your call, Alfred.
[00:42:26.417 --> 00:42:26.958]  Uh, Phil?
[00:42:26.998 --> 00:42:27.398]  Yeah, Alfred.
[00:42:27.899 --> 00:42:28.699]  Alfred, great point.
[00:42:28.779 --> 00:42:34.645]  Because the number one in the national media has never vetted Obama.
[00:42:35.225 --> 00:42:55.672]  They decided they want to have a black individual here, and like I say, I'm open-minded, I'm not prejudiced, but they decided that, and we don't have a free press in this country, and they didn't vet it, and then there's no checks and balances in our legal system to say a person running for president must show documentation, and I think it's outrageous.
[00:42:56.152 --> 00:43:02.014]  But see, we've never had a person like this because, like I said, Arnold Schwarzenegger, before his current problems,
[00:43:02.794 --> 00:43:04.675]  People kept asking him to run for president.
[00:43:04.755 --> 00:43:05.895]  And what did he constantly say?
[00:43:05.915 --> 00:43:08.296]  I don't want to run for president, Phil.
[00:43:08.416 --> 00:43:10.237]  I don't want to be the president.
[00:43:10.737 --> 00:43:12.958]  I just want to love Maria.
[00:43:14.419 --> 00:43:14.959]  Yeah, right.
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:17.020]  Absolutely.
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:19.201]  And that's the difference here.
[00:43:19.341 --> 00:43:24.163]  We have someone who honors our system, and we have someone who's illegal or fraud.
[00:43:24.623 --> 00:43:27.605]  And what kind of example is he to everyone in this country?
[00:43:28.005 --> 00:43:29.966]  Because if he really was legit,
[00:43:30.706 --> 00:43:34.849]  Then, upon the first lawsuit, he should have produced documentation.
[00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:37.492]  He should have said, hey Phil, hey Mr. Berg...
[00:43:38.672 --> 00:43:45.316]  I'm going to send you with our lawyers, give you permission to go to Hawaii to open up and look at the original records.
[00:43:45.797 --> 00:43:46.457]  He never did that.
[00:43:46.817 --> 00:43:48.178]  He's fought it and fought it and fought it.
[00:43:48.499 --> 00:43:49.679]  Why has he fought the issue?
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:51.180]  Because he's a fraud.
[00:43:51.260 --> 00:44:06.431]  Well look, he fought for the long-form birth certificate, spent millions of dollars, taxpayers' dollars, to defend against showing it in April of 2011, where he released what he claims was his real birth certificate then.
[00:44:06.791 --> 00:44:07.992]  But the question is, what was he
[00:44:08.932 --> 00:44:11.873]  Uh, releasing, was it genuine or fake?
[00:44:12.353 --> 00:44:13.274]  Does it seem to be fake?
[00:44:13.554 --> 00:44:22.377]  L4Ware staff looked at this stuff back then, and you look at it under Photoshop or Illustrator, Phil, and it's got all these, you know, wishy-washy stuff.
[00:44:22.437 --> 00:44:25.098]  I mean, I'm no expert in Photoshop, but I know the program.
[00:44:25.338 --> 00:44:27.338]  I run the graphics department here for the magazine.
[00:44:27.559 --> 00:44:33.901]  And I'm telling you, if you look at these, uh, birth certificates, you know, there's Photoshop stuff in there, Phil!
[00:44:34.841 --> 00:44:37.922]  Right, and how about the birth certificate that came out?
[00:44:38.643 --> 00:44:47.086]  I can't think of the gentleman that brought it forth, but he said he was over in Kenya and he brought it back with the footprint of the president supposedly on it.
[00:44:47.106 --> 00:44:48.726]  I'm sure you've seen that birth certificate.
[00:44:49.127 --> 00:44:52.368]  Well, I was in a cab in Florida
[00:44:52.828 --> 00:44:59.096]  With that individual sitting next to me, and he showed me and he swore that that was his birth certificate.
[00:44:59.176 --> 00:45:10.049]  I said, well, I'll tell you what, I really don't believe it, but I'll believe it if you can show me that your papers, the documentation that you were actually in Barbossa, Kenya.
[00:45:10.149 --> 00:45:11.611]  Show me your passport.
[00:45:12.612 --> 00:45:14.973]  Show me your airfare, your hotel, and everything else.
[00:45:15.433 --> 00:45:19.914]  And then I'll believe it, because then you would show me that at the time you got this document, you were there.
[00:45:20.575 --> 00:45:24.016]  Do you think he ever sent that information to me?
[00:45:24.036 --> 00:45:24.876]  Of course not!
[00:45:24.936 --> 00:45:30.358]  Then we found out, after the fact, that he had previously been convicted of forgery.
[00:45:30.658 --> 00:45:35.319]  So, you know, a great guy that we had to come up with phony information.
[00:45:35.459 --> 00:45:37.700]  Robert in Washington, where were you born, Robert?
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:41.281]  Born in San Diego, California.
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:42.661]  Hallelujah!
[00:45:42.701 --> 00:45:43.802]  You were born in San Diego!
[00:45:43.842 --> 00:45:44.342]  No you weren't!
[00:45:44.402 --> 00:45:44.823]  No you weren't!
[00:45:44.843 --> 00:45:45.744]  You were born in Kenya!
[00:45:45.924 --> 00:45:46.885]  You were born in Kenya!
[00:45:46.905 --> 00:45:49.507]  That's right, Kenya, Kenya.
[00:45:49.767 --> 00:45:52.009]  No, I was in the Navy, but my dad was in the Navy.
[00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:57.514]  He is in law enforcement and so am I here in the state of Washington.
[00:45:57.534 --> 00:46:07.243]  He's about to retire and we have been consistently trying to inform our co-workers about
[00:46:09.305 --> 00:46:12.487]  The state of where things are at right now politically.
[00:46:12.507 --> 00:46:20.471]  And yes, I mean, everybody's tuning into the bandwagon that, on the bandwagon that, yeah, you know, Obama is not from the United States.
[00:46:20.911 --> 00:46:28.475]  It took me a while to get my father convinced, but after showing him the films and all the documentation, I mean, it raises eyebrows.
[00:46:29.215 --> 00:46:32.597]  And a lot of us are waking up here in the state of Washington to it.
[00:46:35.330 --> 00:46:39.175]  She attends Washington State University and she's been waking people up.
[00:46:39.656 --> 00:46:46.284]  I got her on this InfoWars stuff here about six months ago and people have been waking up.
[00:46:46.485 --> 00:46:51.391]  So people in the state of Washington are really, really going for it and they're starting
[00:46:53.257 --> 00:46:56.878]  Well, we're glad to hear that, Robert, and thanks for the kind words.
[00:46:56.898 --> 00:47:03.079]  We've got some interest from folks in the Washington area that are interested in a franchise for InfoWars Magazine as well.
[00:47:03.139 --> 00:47:05.960]  Do you have a question for Phil?
[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:08.041]  I do, I do.
[00:47:08.421 --> 00:47:13.062]  If Obama is put back in the office,
[00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:25.916]  I mean, what do you think is going to be the actual... I mean, Obama's already triggered a lot, and he's already raised a lot of eyebrows based on what he's talked about, especially in the debate.
[00:47:26.536 --> 00:47:41.704]  What do you think is going to be the main thing that will open up a lot of people's eyes as far as for them to even really start doing something about it?
[00:47:41.744 --> 00:47:43.705]  Because at this point, it really seems that
[00:47:44.815 --> 00:47:55.862]  People know about the things that he's doing, but what exactly do you think it's going to trigger the people to get the attention that Obama... I mean, is that making sense?
[00:47:56.062 --> 00:47:57.843]  Yeah, thanks for your call, Robert.
[00:47:58.263 --> 00:48:00.425]  What's it really going to take to wake people up, Phil?
[00:48:02.124 --> 00:48:08.170]  I don't know what more, because the things that he has done detrimental to this country are so outrageous.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:12.654]  You know, the biggest factor, I mean, just touching Obamacare is a nightmare.
[00:48:13.395 --> 00:48:17.238]  Gas prices were, what, $1.89 when he took office, and now they're $4.00.
[00:48:17.639 --> 00:48:22.784]  And out there where you are, Robert, in San Diego, well, you're Washington State, the person before San Diego.
[00:48:23.264 --> 00:48:24.865]  Out in California, it's like $5.00 a gallon for gas.
[00:48:26.767 --> 00:48:27.868]  There's so many other things.
[00:48:28.128 --> 00:48:32.230]  He takes credit for more drilling here in the United States, but he didn't do it.
[00:48:32.471 --> 00:48:33.511]  He's cut off drilling.
[00:48:33.951 --> 00:48:40.796]  He is doing everything to make this country not what it is.
[00:48:40.856 --> 00:48:47.099]  He's trying to make this country, like in Europe, to the detriment of all of us.
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:50.541]  He's trying to redistribute the wealth.
[00:48:50.581 --> 00:48:51.582]  He's trying to do things
[00:48:53.343 --> 00:48:55.183]  So adverse to each one of us.
[00:48:55.904 --> 00:49:05.205]  And unfortunately, people have not waken up enough to say, I'm going to stop this because what he's doing is inch by inch, he's taking away our rights.
[00:49:05.686 --> 00:49:06.866]  And that's very scary.
[00:49:06.886 --> 00:49:15.928]  I mean, right now, there's word that keeps coming up that Hillary Clinton is going to go into this arms deal and sign some arms thing with the United Nations.
[00:49:16.408 --> 00:49:16.868]  Exactly.
[00:49:17.008 --> 00:49:18.388]  It's about taking away your rights.
[00:49:18.448 --> 00:49:21.769]  It's about it's about, you know, getting you off your
[00:49:22.549 --> 00:49:23.450]  Off your rocker.
[00:49:23.770 --> 00:49:26.371]  Let's go to, uh, I'm gonna go real quick to James in Florida.
[00:49:26.391 --> 00:49:27.432]  What do you think, James?
[00:49:27.452 --> 00:49:29.032]  You were born in Malaysia, right, James?
[00:49:30.933 --> 00:49:33.235]  I was born in New York, but I just have a question for Phil.
[00:49:33.995 --> 00:49:34.956]  Sure, go ahead, James.
[00:49:36.136 --> 00:49:40.518]  I was wondering, um, what's your opinion on the Zionist control over the US media?
[00:49:42.659 --> 00:49:42.780]  Um...
[00:49:44.855 --> 00:49:45.416]  Well, I don't know.
[00:49:45.496 --> 00:49:47.137]  You know, someone's controlling it.
[00:49:47.177 --> 00:49:48.298]  I'm not sure if they're denying it.
[00:49:48.358 --> 00:49:49.559]  I don't think they really are.
[00:49:49.599 --> 00:50:00.728]  But you have people like George Soros, which is... I mean, the media now in this country is owned by three or four individuals that are behind it, and I think that hurts all of us.
[00:50:01.448 --> 00:50:02.910]  We should insist on a free press.
[00:50:04.211 --> 00:50:12.257]  It's a laughing, it's a joke, when they don't question Obama about anything, versus the Constitution.
[00:50:12.317 --> 00:50:21.465]  So, I'm not sure who's controlling it, but it's controlled press, and it's to the detriment of most of the citizens of this country, and we better wake up before it's too late.
[00:50:22.666 --> 00:50:24.948]  Well, I mean, if you look into it, they all are Zionists.
[00:50:25.709 --> 00:50:26.910]  The information's out there.
[00:50:27.841 --> 00:50:29.942]  Well, I can tell you who's not free press.
[00:50:30.002 --> 00:50:35.784]  We are independent media right here at InfoWars, the InfoWars Money Bomb.
[00:50:36.785 --> 00:50:40.947]  Let's take a quick break, real quick, and we'll come back.
[00:50:41.007 --> 00:50:42.848]  I want to thank Phil Burks.
[00:50:43.048 --> 00:50:44.688]  Phil, let's go take a real quick break here.
[00:50:44.708 --> 00:50:48.730]  I want to take a minute here, and then I want to thank you for staying up with us.
[00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:53.312]  And again, reiterate to the listeners, the InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[00:50:54.032 --> 00:50:54.413]  Be sure to
[00:50:55.433 --> 00:50:56.274]  Check out the site.
[00:50:56.454 --> 00:51:00.959]  If you can't donate $25 or $50, guys, buy some magazines!
[00:51:01.459 --> 00:51:02.520]  Hell, buy this shirt!
[00:51:02.641 --> 00:51:03.702]  It's signed by Alex!
[00:51:04.442 --> 00:51:04.923]  There you go!
[00:51:04.983 --> 00:51:06.885]  There's the boogeyman right there from Malaysia!
[00:51:07.345 --> 00:51:07.746]  Kenya!
[00:51:08.106 --> 00:51:08.807]  No, Hawaii!
[00:51:09.488 --> 00:51:10.529]  Anyway, we'll be right back.
[00:51:10.649 --> 00:51:11.710]  InfoWars Money Bomb.
[00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:13.812]  Our guest, Philip J. Berg, on the other side.
[00:51:13.832 --> 00:51:14.493]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:24.224 --> 00:51:26.872]  Who controls the past, controls the future.
[00:51:27.394 --> 00:51:29.821]  Who controls the present, controls the past.
[00:51:30.734 --> 00:51:36.237]  The death of Bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat al-Qaeda.
[00:51:36.597 --> 00:51:38.639]  All you gotta do is start looking around.
[00:51:39.039 --> 00:51:40.600]  Start thinking for yourself.
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:42.461]  Start investigating things.
[00:51:42.901 --> 00:51:45.383]  And you will see it all right there.
[00:51:46.964 --> 00:51:48.404]  So you have the power.
[00:51:48.424 --> 00:51:50.286]  Humanity has the power.
[00:51:50.746 --> 00:51:51.846]  We have the power.
[00:51:51.866 --> 00:51:52.827]  You wanna fight?
[00:51:52.867 --> 00:51:55.228]  You better believe you got one!
[00:51:57.597 --> 00:52:01.040]  Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories.
[00:52:01.181 --> 00:52:05.004]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[00:52:33.089 --> 00:52:35.010]  It's the InfoWars Money Bomb 2012.
[00:52:36.051 --> 00:52:38.573]  October 18th and 19th.
[00:52:38.593 --> 00:52:39.974]  48 hour special transmission.
[00:52:40.415 --> 00:52:42.976]  The tyrants need to know we're coming for them.
[00:52:43.317 --> 00:52:45.098]  And the InfoWars is expanding.
[00:52:45.338 --> 00:52:48.681]  And the people of America and the world are awakening and behind us!
[00:52:50.424 --> 00:52:58.707]  While the global scientific dictatorship is busy injecting toxins into our water supply to dumb us down, we're busy injecting reality into society.
[00:52:59.288 --> 00:53:01.669]  It's the beginning of the end for the New World Order.
[00:53:02.189 --> 00:53:04.410]  Donate at infowarsmoneybomb.com
[00:53:07.375 --> 00:53:07.735]  All right.
[00:53:08.236 --> 00:53:08.496]  All right.
[00:53:08.536 --> 00:53:14.099]  We are back with our guest, Philip J. Berg from the website Obamacrimes.com.
[00:53:14.839 --> 00:53:19.342]  And we are talking about Obama and this whole birth certificate issue.
[00:53:19.402 --> 00:53:24.525]  I cannot believe the Republicans are not using this as a talking point, Bill.
[00:53:26.195 --> 00:53:29.217]  If you were a Republican, wouldn't you be burning him at the stake with this?
[00:53:30.037 --> 00:53:31.398]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:53:31.838 --> 00:53:39.562]  But every time the Democrats make it up like, oh, it's the birther movement, and thereafter, you know, I'm considered, I think, the father of the birthers.
[00:53:39.902 --> 00:53:43.164]  I don't care what title you put me on here, but let's just get to the truth.
[00:53:43.524 --> 00:53:50.748]  I mean, if one of these papers, the major papers in this country, the New York Times, you know, Washington Post, would just ask the question, but they won't.
[00:53:51.408 --> 00:53:54.289]  And now, like, there's two in bed with Obama.
[00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:58.171]  If he keeps going down in the polls, maybe they will come up with it.
[00:53:58.591 --> 00:54:04.554]  But, as I stated, it's a guarantee for Obama to lose if we can expose Obama.
[00:54:04.714 --> 00:54:06.354]  And we still have three weeks left to do that.
[00:54:06.855 --> 00:54:09.076]  So make sure you contribute to Moneybomb.
[00:54:09.456 --> 00:54:15.338]  If you can send us some money also at obamacrimes.com, we would put up a reward.
[00:54:15.458 --> 00:54:16.639]  Someone out there, if you're
[00:54:17.139 --> 00:54:25.266]  A multi-millionaire, which I know there's many people and I'm sure they listen to Alex, if you can put up the money, it won't cost you a penny until we get the right information.
[00:54:25.626 --> 00:54:28.989]  I'd like to see a $2 million reward put up there to expose Obama.
[00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:35.555]  And someone out there that is contributing, I think Romney raised like $190 million last month.
[00:54:35.595 --> 00:54:38.598]  I mean, so much money is being raised and spent and wasted.
[00:54:39.118 --> 00:54:42.942]  This thing is, you won't have to spend the money, you just have to post it through a bank.
[00:54:43.562 --> 00:54:46.684]  And once the information's up there, then you'd have to pay the money.
[00:54:46.964 --> 00:54:51.907]  But it would do this country justice because we deserve it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:52.007 --> 00:54:53.008]  We deserve the truth.
[00:54:53.408 --> 00:55:02.213]  And the truth is, Obama and Michelle Obama and everyone around him from the early campaign and everyone around him now in the White House, they know he's a fraud.
[00:55:02.453 --> 00:55:03.293]  They know he's a phony.
[00:55:03.674 --> 00:55:06.936]  Everyone should be, not just put in jail, because that's not our system.
[00:55:07.016 --> 00:55:10.678]  Our system is, everyone around him should be indicted.
[00:55:11.218 --> 00:55:15.621]  Should be tried in our court systems, and anyone convicted should go to jail.
[00:55:15.701 --> 00:55:17.582]  What are your thoughts, Phil?
[00:55:17.683 --> 00:55:19.884]  Is Obama being set up to fail, in your opinion?
[00:55:21.745 --> 00:55:26.188]  No, I don't think so, because if so, you know, the money people would switch to someone else.
[00:55:27.009 --> 00:55:36.876]  The reason, like, they're talking about buying this $8 million, $5 million property in Hawaii for Obama is because he has given millions of dollars to his, quote, friends.
[00:55:37.416 --> 00:55:42.382]  He's appointed new people, he's given deals that we don't even know all these deals.
[00:55:43.504 --> 00:55:48.810]  Look at the money he's put out there, which have gone down the drain on these heat shields.
[00:55:49.291 --> 00:55:51.554]  Obama has paid off his friends.
[00:55:52.094 --> 00:55:53.896]  And I assure you, if he loses,
[00:55:54.597 --> 00:56:02.546]  Between November and January 20th, he'll be also paying off in so many ways because he has time there and he'll do it.
[00:56:02.946 --> 00:56:04.088]  He's scary everyone.
[00:56:04.108 --> 00:56:05.109]  He's frightening.
[00:56:05.429 --> 00:56:06.410]  You gotta stop him.
[00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:09.994]  Help me expose Obama and we can do it in the next three weeks.
[00:56:10.214 --> 00:56:12.415]  ObamaCrimes.com, our guest Philip J. Berg.
[00:56:12.455 --> 00:56:30.503]  It just seems to me like though, Phil, that there's a lot of talking points on mainstream Cinderella media, you know, where they are trying to make Obama out to be this perfect fall guy to set up some type of a civil unrest or, you know, cause race wars or race riots.
[00:56:31.543 --> 00:56:32.264]  What are your thoughts on this?
[00:56:33.024 --> 00:56:37.589]  Does that make sense or are we just, we're really just, I'm really missing the ball here.
[00:56:37.609 --> 00:56:40.212]  It's just that, hey, you gotta be a US citizen to be president.
[00:56:40.272 --> 00:56:41.333]  That's what it's all really about.
[00:56:41.704 --> 00:56:49.010]  That's it, and I hope, ladies and gentlemen out there, people, if he loses, please, we don't need race riots in this country.
[00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:59.820]  I mean, I think Obama's presidency has hurt the blacks in this country, which might take forever to recover, but please, if he loses, we don't need anything here.
[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:03.443]  It comes down to the fact that one individual
[00:57:03.983 --> 00:57:08.288]  One member of the black community, Obama, has lied to all of us in this country.
[00:57:08.688 --> 00:57:10.150]  So there's no reason for a race riot.
[00:57:10.170 --> 00:57:10.630]  That's right.
[00:57:10.851 --> 00:57:13.894]  Like I say, I'm a lifetime member of the NAACP.
[00:57:14.294 --> 00:57:15.936]  You know, I'm for fair, I'm for freedom.
[00:57:16.156 --> 00:57:21.041]  You're a Democrat, you're a lifetime member of the NAACP, this is not what we need anyway.
[00:57:21.362 --> 00:57:21.822]  It's about...
[00:57:23.043 --> 00:57:36.472]  It's about the Constitution, and it's about being a United States citizen, and it's about action, and it's about time, after four years, that we look for the real answers on this birth certificate.
[00:57:36.712 --> 00:57:38.053]  Final thoughts, Phil Berg.
[00:57:39.094 --> 00:57:40.015]  Pleasure to be on you.
[00:57:40.075 --> 00:57:41.575]  Give my best to Alex Jones.
[00:57:41.675 --> 00:57:43.336]  Everyone, Russell, it's great to be on with you.
[00:57:43.797 --> 00:57:45.277]  Everyone, contribute to Money Bomb.
[00:57:45.337 --> 00:57:49.319]  It's really essential to keep Alex Jones, to get the word out.
[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:52.201]  And if you can also, you know, don't give to me rather than him.
[00:57:52.481 --> 00:57:55.142]  Match it, give me the same thing, obamacrimes.com.
[00:57:55.623 --> 00:58:01.085]  And if someone out there has the $2 million to post, I'll get a reward out there so fast, and they'll cover it.
[00:58:01.426 --> 00:58:07.649]  And someone out there who has the information will produce it, and then we'll get Obama where he belongs, in jail.
[00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:09.133]  Not in the White House.
[00:58:09.735 --> 00:58:12.988]  Thank you so much for your time tonight, Phil Berg, Obamacrimes.com.
[00:58:13.008 --> 00:58:13.389]  Thank you, sir.
[00:58:14.045 --> 00:58:14.545]  My pleasure.
[00:58:45.005 --> 00:58:49.427]  Anyway, I'm Russell, the general manager for InfoWars Magazine.
[00:58:49.467 --> 00:58:52.648]  Stick around, more InfoWars Moneybomb coming your way.
[00:58:52.948 --> 00:58:56.149]  Up next, Dan Bodondi, gonna have three hours.
[00:58:57.069 --> 00:58:59.450]  I don't know how he's gonna do it, but he's drinking lots of coffee.
[00:58:59.770 --> 00:59:01.730]  Dan Bodondi, InfoWars Moneybomb.
[00:59:01.770 --> 00:59:03.051]  I'm Russell, we'll see you next time.
[00:59:03.531 --> 00:59:05.411]  We got 36 more hours of this stuff.
[00:59:05.671 --> 00:59:07.712]  Stick around, InfoWarsMoneybomb.com.
[00:59:13.497 --> 00:59:18.200]  And we're about to give you an exclusive tour of the Info Wars studio.
[00:59:18.620 --> 00:59:22.702]  I know quite often the public wonders what is Alex's studio look like.
[00:59:22.742 --> 00:59:24.343]  He always talks about it on air.
[00:59:24.783 --> 00:59:31.806]  Well, we're about to give you an exclusive tour of the studio and once again we thank you because without you this wouldn't be possible.
[00:59:31.866 --> 00:59:34.628]  So follow me and let's get on the tour.
[00:59:36.109 --> 00:59:40.311]  And as you can see occasionally there are different posters on the wall that promote freedom.
[00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:47.507]  This poster over here says, it's of Thomas Jefferson, it says, when the people fear the government, there is tyranny.
[00:59:48.468 --> 00:59:51.612]  However, when the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[00:59:52.953 --> 00:59:56.978]  And you're going to see posters like that that promote freedom throughout the studio.
[00:59:56.998 --> 01:00:00.903]  And this is our producer, Rob Dew.
[01:00:02.776 --> 01:00:07.358]  When you walk into the studio, um, Alex's radio studio is right there.
[01:00:07.798 --> 01:00:09.879]  So it's not like in the back somewhere, it's right there.
[01:00:09.939 --> 01:00:12.520]  So, this is where Alex produces his radio show.
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:14.921]  It says, Do Not Disturb.
[01:00:14.981 --> 01:00:15.941]  Is anyone here right now?
[01:00:15.961 --> 01:00:17.081]  No.
[01:00:17.101 --> 01:00:20.463]  Okay, so we're gonna give you a sneak peek.
[01:00:20.483 --> 01:00:24.344]  This is the view from Alex's seat here.
[01:00:25.565 --> 01:00:28.566]  As you can see, all the cameras, high-tech HD cameras.
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:32.381]  That enables you to watch the show on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:00:32.421 --> 01:00:33.761]  You also see the glass here.
[01:00:34.581 --> 01:00:38.082]  That's where the radio producer kind of communicates with him.
[01:00:40.402 --> 01:00:43.363]  And obviously you see the spread down there of the magazines.
[01:00:43.503 --> 01:00:48.224]  Alex literally has stacks of news prior to every show.
[01:00:48.284 --> 01:00:50.224]  Sometimes as much as 20 stacks.
[01:00:51.824 --> 01:00:54.225]  So, a little bit of a different view.
[01:00:55.461 --> 01:00:55.961]  For fans.
[01:00:56.461 --> 01:01:02.964]  Now this is the view that Alex sees when he walks out of his studio and he does this during commercial breaks as well.
[01:01:02.984 --> 01:01:03.624]  Let's take a look.
[01:01:05.045 --> 01:01:05.785]  This is his team.
[01:01:05.825 --> 01:01:07.426]  This is his radio team.
[01:01:07.466 --> 01:01:08.106]  This is Chris.
[01:01:10.267 --> 01:01:11.147]  This is CJ.
[01:01:11.207 --> 01:01:13.088]  CJ also produces a lot of the shows.
[01:01:13.588 --> 01:01:17.770]  Dan Badandi is also a reporter slash producer for the radio.
[01:01:18.070 --> 01:01:19.570]  And this is obviously the switchboard.
[01:01:20.070 --> 01:01:23.832]  And let's give you a shot of what it looks like through the glass.
[01:01:25.282 --> 01:01:29.405]  Okay, if you want, you guys follow me, I don't mind, we've got a soundproof room in here.
[01:01:31.386 --> 01:01:34.988]  Alright, so we are recording the, we call it the Tonight.
[01:01:35.468 --> 01:01:42.312]  And every night for the Infowars Nightly News, you know, it's either myself, John Bowner, there's a number of people who come in here, write and record it.
[01:01:42.432 --> 01:01:43.213]  Okay, here we go.
[01:01:44.234 --> 01:01:54.540]  Tonight, the CIA is arming Al-Qaeda in Syria, as thousands of what the New York Times calls hardline Islamic Jihadists invade.
[01:01:55.714 --> 01:02:01.297]  Then, holy sh... There is a staggering amount of feces in our food.
[01:02:02.757 --> 01:02:11.741]  Plus, the nanny state goes into overdrive as an elementary school interrogates and suspends a student for drinking tea.
[01:02:13.002 --> 01:02:16.083]  That's up next on the Info Wars Nightly News.
[01:02:17.524 --> 01:02:18.504]  That's how we roll, baby.
[01:02:19.385 --> 01:02:24.407]  So it's like that, and then we gotta go cut it and put some graphics on top of there.
[01:02:25.182 --> 01:02:34.467]  This is just one of the many things we do daily here, deep behind enemy lines at the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:02:34.987 --> 01:02:42.431]  Now right next door to Alex's studio is Kurt Nimmo's office and Adan Salazar's office.
[01:02:42.811 --> 01:02:46.173]  These are the individuals, they're some of the writers for InfoWars.com.
[01:02:46.573 --> 01:02:50.916]  So quite often in between breaks, Alex will peek into this office and he'll say, hey guys,
[01:02:51.764 --> 01:02:53.046]  Write up a story about this.
[01:02:53.626 --> 01:02:58.012]  And they're right next door, literally inches away from Alex's studio.
[01:02:58.052 --> 01:03:00.114]  So this is Kurt Nimmo, the famous Kurt Nimmo.
[01:03:00.495 --> 01:03:01.756]  This is Adan Salazar.
[01:03:01.776 --> 01:03:03.939]  They're two of the writers here at InfoWars.com.
[01:03:05.421 --> 01:03:06.442]  And this is their office.
[01:03:07.705 --> 01:03:13.190]  And they're busy writing stories throughout the day and posting it on InfoWars.com.
[01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:16.493]  This right here, right outside the studio, is story ideas.
[01:03:16.573 --> 01:03:24.701]  If you want your story aired on the radio show, if it previously aired on the nightly news, just let Alex know here.
[01:03:24.741 --> 01:03:27.583]  Hey Alex, can you show my story on the radio?
[01:03:27.663 --> 01:03:28.965]  Can you air my story on the radio?
[01:03:30.126 --> 01:03:31.247]  News report ideas.
[01:03:32.196 --> 01:03:36.218]  You know, errands for Alex to do, media requests.
[01:03:36.798 --> 01:03:38.760]  So it's just a little kind of box there.
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:43.922]  Oh, as you can see right here, we have a lot of humorous stuff on the walls.
[01:03:44.983 --> 01:03:46.604]  This is one of the posters we have on the wall.
[01:03:46.664 --> 01:03:49.285]  It says, You write what you're told.
[01:03:49.926 --> 01:03:50.926]  Thanks, Corporate News.
[01:03:51.446 --> 01:03:53.147]  We couldn't control the people without you.
[01:03:53.688 --> 01:03:55.909]  A message from the Ministry of Homeland Security.
[01:03:56.409 --> 01:03:59.551]  We've got some local articles here that show
[01:04:00.618 --> 01:04:07.303]  When Alex was on the rise a couple years ago, Alex Jones preaching the conspiracy gospel at a station near you.
[01:04:07.943 --> 01:04:14.748]  And that was a profile piece that the Austin American Statesman wrote up in 1999.
[01:04:15.288 --> 01:04:18.230]  And these are different articles.
[01:04:18.970 --> 01:04:22.193]  And of course, this is Alex looking ripped.
[01:04:22.753 --> 01:04:26.375]  He won the Best of Austin, Best TV Personality in 2001.
[01:04:26.435 --> 01:04:28.477]  This one is of George Washington.
[01:04:29.369 --> 01:04:44.733]  And he's, the quote reads, A free people ought not only to be armed and disciplined, but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might attempt to abuse them, which would include their own government.
[01:04:45.353 --> 01:04:47.873]  And of course, you've got the famous megaphone.
[01:04:49.854 --> 01:04:51.194]  I'm talking to you, scam!
[01:04:51.214 --> 01:04:53.895]  You hear that, New World Order trash?
[01:04:57.168 --> 01:04:58.068]  I always wanted to do that.
[01:04:59.429 --> 01:05:09.972]  And over here is, you know, very simply where the reporters on the InfoWars Nightly News team, where the cameras are stored and where we place them every day.
[01:05:11.012 --> 01:05:15.954]  So now we're going to walk this way and we're going to see some
[01:05:32.811 --> 01:05:34.613]  This is our land.
[01:05:37.455 --> 01:05:40.737]  These are our people.
[01:05:40.777 --> 01:05:41.497]  The workers.
[01:05:41.537 --> 01:05:44.580]  The strivers.
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:45.740]  The builders.
[01:05:47.322 --> 01:05:50.704]  These are our people.
[01:05:50.784 --> 01:05:54.006]  Who are they?
[01:05:54.146 --> 01:05:55.687]  They are the Dark Arms.
[01:05:56.917 --> 01:05:58.158]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:05:58.218 --> 01:06:01.422]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:23.628 --> 01:06:28.110]  And welcome to the Alex Jones Show on Graveyard Shift, and I'm Dan Badandi.
[01:06:28.130 --> 01:06:33.191]  I'm going to be joining you for the next three hours, and we've got a jam-packed show for you folks.
[01:06:33.231 --> 01:06:37.613]  We've got, well, we've got to cover news first, and we've got a special guest in about a half hour from now.
[01:06:38.033 --> 01:06:47.356]  His name is William Schnobel, and before we get into that, folks, again, we're going to cover the news, we're going to take your phone calls before our guest, and we're going to open the phone lines if you want to ask our guest a question.
[01:06:48.056 --> 01:06:52.502]  And about four o'clock, which is two hours from now, we're going to be joined by Rich Anatone.
[01:06:52.542 --> 01:06:54.464]  He's going to be co-hosting with me for the final hour.
[01:06:54.484 --> 01:07:02.613]  We're going to be talking about news that happened during the week, and we're going to cover a lot of highlighting news, articles and everything else that happened over the course of the last week.
[01:07:03.514 --> 01:07:09.257]  And, um, William Schnobel and these former Illuminati folks, and a lot of people out there keep bugging Alex.
[01:07:09.577 --> 01:07:11.278]  How come you don't talk about the New World Order?
[01:07:11.298 --> 01:07:12.538]  How come you don't know what she does?
[01:07:12.558 --> 01:07:15.139]  How come you don't talk about the Illuminati, what she does?
[01:07:15.199 --> 01:07:17.941]  But we're going to get into deep depth about the Illuminati.
[01:07:18.661 --> 01:07:22.545]  And also, we're going to get into deep depth about the real origins of Halloween.
[01:07:22.985 --> 01:07:26.168]  This is a gross, grotesque holiday, folks.
[01:07:26.749 --> 01:07:30.192]  And after you hear this, you're not going to take your kids out trick-or-treating.
[01:07:30.292 --> 01:07:34.076]  It is that vile, that diabolical, that disgusting.
[01:07:34.637 --> 01:07:36.278]  And we're going to get into some news first.
[01:07:36.418 --> 01:07:37.419]  And folks, again,
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:39.921]  This is a very sensitive subject.
[01:07:39.941 --> 01:07:42.943]  I mean, the Illuminati people think, oh, it's just a conspiracy.
[01:07:43.003 --> 01:07:44.664]  They ceased in 1790.
[01:07:44.764 --> 01:07:45.805]  No, folks, they did not.
[01:07:46.385 --> 01:07:51.368]  I could be here for the next six hours telling you that the Illuminati does exist.
[01:07:51.428 --> 01:07:52.108]  And I got proof.
[01:07:52.189 --> 01:07:54.230]  I mean, I got, I'm an Illuminati historian.
[01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:56.771]  And what's better than me is William Schnoblen.
[01:07:57.212 --> 01:08:04.716]  Again, William Schnoblen, withoneaccord.org, that's his website, withoneaccord.org.
[01:08:08.843 --> 01:08:15.648]  And it's going to be a great show, folks, and we're going to get to the top priorities of the Illuminati and also Halloween and everything else.
[01:08:15.668 --> 01:08:17.049]  But first, let's cover some U.S.
[01:08:17.109 --> 01:08:17.329]  news.
[01:08:17.389 --> 01:08:24.934]  And people, if you want to call up and chime in, we're going to open the phone lines up and we're going to just cover some news that happened during the course of the week.
[01:08:25.354 --> 01:08:26.935]  And I'm really angry, folks.
[01:08:26.975 --> 01:08:27.456]  I really am.
[01:08:27.556 --> 01:08:29.857]  And I hate to start the show off like this.
[01:08:29.877 --> 01:08:30.337]  I really do.
[01:08:30.698 --> 01:08:35.421]  And I'm just so fired up right now because I sit back there and I produce Alex's show.
[01:08:35.461 --> 01:08:36.942]  I pull up the articles for him and all that.
[01:08:37.022 --> 01:08:38.243]  And I have to read all this stuff.
[01:08:39.124 --> 01:08:41.628]  And I'm sitting there, but back there I just get angry.
[01:08:42.069 --> 01:08:45.034]  You know, just seeing all this stuff, my country going to hell in the handbasket.
[01:08:45.094 --> 01:08:47.718]  Bottom line, going to hell in the handbasket.
[01:08:49.962 --> 01:08:51.745]  And I just gotta take a deep breath because it...
[01:08:52.898 --> 01:08:57.280]  Folks, covering this stuff all day and night is, I mean, it just gets to you.
[01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:02.881]  And if I don't have a strong spiritual faith in God, and, you know, if I don't have that, I don't know where I'd be.
[01:09:02.901 --> 01:09:09.644]  But it is so grotesque every day when you pull up the articles, hundreds of articles, folks, not just a few, hundreds.
[01:09:10.524 --> 01:09:13.985]  And I'm speaking because I'm one of the producers here that pulled the articles for Alex.
[01:09:14.705 --> 01:09:18.707]  And that's why Alex has got stacks of news all over his desk, folks, stacks.
[01:09:20.718 --> 01:09:27.303]  And I got a few stacks here by me, and I'm probably never going to touch half of this because the tyranny is so bad in this country, folks.
[01:09:27.904 --> 01:09:32.948]  And this is why, right here, right now, folks, this is why we need this money bomb.
[01:09:33.028 --> 01:09:34.369]  And we're not begging you for money.
[01:09:34.409 --> 01:09:39.353]  We're not one of those false prophets from the 700 Club, the Billy Grahams, the Pat Robinsons.
[01:09:39.453 --> 01:09:40.374]  Oh, we need your money.
[01:09:40.394 --> 01:09:41.695]  Satan's going to put a curse on me.
[01:09:41.755 --> 01:09:42.856]  No, folks, we're not like that.
[01:09:43.556 --> 01:09:44.697]  We're not mainstream media.
[01:09:45.077 --> 01:09:48.199]  We don't get bailouts by corporate interest groups.
[01:09:48.259 --> 01:09:50.721]  We don't get bailouts by world bankers.
[01:09:50.861 --> 01:09:52.822]  We don't get bailouts by anybody.
[01:09:53.382 --> 01:09:57.145]  The only people that give us money is you folks out there who run the operation.
[01:09:58.069 --> 01:09:58.829]  You support us.
[01:09:58.849 --> 01:10:00.489]  We're buying our products and everything else.
[01:10:00.890 --> 01:10:02.410]  And we're just asking for a donation.
[01:10:02.490 --> 01:10:05.670]  I mean, like Alex said earlier, I mean, if you can't afford it, no problem.
[01:10:06.291 --> 01:10:06.951]  Spread the word.
[01:10:07.031 --> 01:10:08.511]  Infowars.com.
[01:10:08.591 --> 01:10:11.131]  Prisonplanet.com.tv.
[01:10:11.151 --> 01:10:11.131]  $5.95.
[01:10:11.171 --> 01:10:17.913]  $5.95.
[01:10:11.451 --> 01:10:17.913]  You get to watch the Alex Jones Show live on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:10:18.313 --> 01:10:22.033]  And you get five passwords besides yours to give out to friends and family.
[01:10:22.474 --> 01:10:24.034]  And that's a great Christmas gift right there.
[01:10:25.074 --> 01:10:26.276]  We need your support, folks.
[01:10:26.496 --> 01:10:30.121]  It is, I mean, the operation is so expensive.
[01:10:30.281 --> 01:10:39.333]  I mean, just to send a reporter, we're in Texas here, just to send a reporter out to California and the camera crew and all just to cover a story, it costs thousands.
[01:10:40.785 --> 01:10:45.890]  It's not cheap, folks, and people, you know, why do you guys want our money, okay?
[01:10:46.250 --> 01:10:48.232]  We're not asking, you know, we're not begging.
[01:10:48.272 --> 01:10:50.534]  We're asking if you want to give, please do.
[01:10:51.355 --> 01:10:57.300]  I mean, we're up to $108,000 right now, and folks, that might sound like a lot to you, but it's not.
[01:10:58.301 --> 01:11:03.085]  $108,000 will probably keep the lights on in the place here for like a month or two, maybe.
[01:11:03.485 --> 01:11:07.188]  And that's not counting the salaries and everything else for the reporters and everything else.
[01:11:07.808 --> 01:11:14.252]  So we're begging you folks, okay, in a liberty way to say, hey, we need your funding.
[01:11:15.233 --> 01:11:17.295]  This is a people, grassroots operation.
[01:11:18.255 --> 01:11:26.017]  We wouldn't be here, this studio wouldn't be here if it wasn't for people like you out there buying our magazines, buying our books, our DVDs, our t-shirts.
[01:11:26.497 --> 01:11:30.538]  Especially this t-shirt here, I think it's my favorite t-shirt, InfoWarshop.com.
[01:11:31.158 --> 01:11:33.658]  And it comes with the hat and everything else, great stuff.
[01:11:33.758 --> 01:11:40.720]  And also if you're interested in learning about the Illuminati, we got a great book here, it's on InfoWarshop.com by Fritz Springmeier.
[01:11:41.863 --> 01:11:43.524]  It's bloodlines of the Illuminati.
[01:11:43.705 --> 01:11:47.248]  I mean, he goes to all the bloodlines, and it's crazy stuff, folks.
[01:11:47.368 --> 01:11:54.254]  I mean, Rothschild, all the big banker families and everything, have to, you know, what it has to do with the Illuminati.
[01:11:55.174 --> 01:12:01.340]  But let's get into some news, and we're going to open the phone lines up, so anybody wants to chime in, or if you want to wait, it's up to you.
[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:02.761]  You can talk to the guests later.
[01:12:02.881 --> 01:12:03.642]  I'll call back again.
[01:12:05.106 --> 01:12:13.311]  But one story that touched me this week, the FBI entraps witless Patsy in Federal Reserve bombing plot.
[01:12:14.491 --> 01:12:16.732]  Again, another FBI setup, folks.
[01:12:16.973 --> 01:12:28.079]  How many times, how many times, folks, has there been bomb plots, terror attacks, and always has to do the FBI has the hands in the mix?
[01:12:28.939 --> 01:12:29.500]  All the time.
[01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:33.522]  The Christmas tree bomber, the FBI gave him the car bomb.
[01:12:34.687 --> 01:12:35.588]  This is on record.
[01:12:37.549 --> 01:12:43.952]  I mean, look at what happened, the bombing scare in Times Square a couple years ago after that South Park episode about Mojave.
[01:12:45.073 --> 01:12:47.515]  The FBI gave them the car with the bomb in it.
[01:12:49.196 --> 01:12:51.397]  It's all set up propaganda, folks.
[01:12:51.777 --> 01:12:53.438]  It's called false flag terrorism.
[01:12:53.598 --> 01:12:54.939]  We got them, this is on record.
[01:12:54.959 --> 01:13:00.022]  They got military manuals on this, we're going to show in a few minutes, tons of it.
[01:13:02.034 --> 01:13:06.197]  And yeah, from New York Post, terrorist attempts to blow up Federal Reserve Bank.
[01:13:06.718 --> 01:13:09.620]  And the FBI is admitting, yes, we gave them the car bomb.
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:11.442]  You know, we coached them.
[01:13:11.462 --> 01:13:18.808]  You know, we coached the guy to put a thousand pound bomb at the Federal Reserve.
[01:13:20.069 --> 01:13:25.773]  And people, I mean, if you can't read through the lines, how many, again, how many times do we have to see this?
[01:13:26.194 --> 01:13:28.595]  And the FBI comes along, yes, we were involved.
[01:13:29.676 --> 01:13:31.438]  We were involved with it, of course they were.
[01:13:33.105 --> 01:13:37.205]  And we got Earthquake Disaster Drill Makes Femus Martial Law Agenda!
[01:13:38.496 --> 01:13:40.937]  Now, before we get into this, I want to tell a story.
[01:13:41.337 --> 01:13:49.200]  When I was flying down here from Rhode Island, I stopped in BWI Airport for a layover, and my flight was delayed.
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:54.262]  So I'm sitting there, and one of the guys was talking, you know, some guy was talking next to me on his phone.
[01:13:54.282 --> 01:13:58.923]  I heard him mention Gianna Napolitano, blah, blah, blah, Homeland Security, and he worked for it.
[01:13:58.943 --> 01:14:01.404]  So I'm like, all right, let me ask this guy some questions.
[01:14:01.844 --> 01:14:03.865]  So he gets off the phone, I'm like, hi, how you doing?
[01:14:03.905 --> 01:14:06.306]  It's like, I couldn't help overhearing you.
[01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:09.072]  Talk about Janet Napolitano and all that.
[01:14:09.372 --> 01:14:10.633]  He goes, yeah, I work for FEMA.
[01:14:10.693 --> 01:14:14.476]  I'm a grounds transportation coordinator for FEMA and Homeland Security.
[01:14:15.557 --> 01:14:18.419]  And he's in it, and I'm trying to test this guy out, see where he is.
[01:14:18.439 --> 01:14:27.207]  Long story short, he learned that I was going to be a reporter for Alex Jones, whatever, and he's on the same page.
[01:14:27.247 --> 01:14:32.431]  He says he's been listening to Alex for God knows how long, and he's been working with FEMA and Homeland Security for about 15 years.
[01:14:33.812 --> 01:14:36.473]  And he wants to stay on the inside, but he told me right out.
[01:14:36.893 --> 01:14:42.734]  He goes, since we're on the same page here, he goes, there's going to be martial law coming soon.
[01:14:43.295 --> 01:14:43.835]  He told me this.
[01:14:43.855 --> 01:14:52.317]  He goes, the reason why I'm here in Washington, D.C., BWI, Baltimore, Washington International floor, they called an emergency meeting.
[01:14:53.597 --> 01:14:55.798]  They called an emergency meeting for us to be here.
[01:14:56.278 --> 01:14:59.859]  He goes, now they don't tell me everything because I'm just a ground transportation coordinator.
[01:15:00.936 --> 01:15:03.798]  So what he did was, he opened his briefcase.
[01:15:03.878 --> 01:15:09.822]  Now before I get to that, he was explaining to me, that I gotta pull the plug for martial law.
[01:15:09.842 --> 01:15:11.183]  They called a meeting this morning.
[01:15:11.223 --> 01:15:13.204]  We had to be in Washington ASAP.
[01:15:15.655 --> 01:15:21.120]  And so when he basically used tell me the stuff, then he opens his briefcase and shows me documents.
[01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:23.421]  He says for secret eyes on all that good stuff.
[01:15:23.582 --> 01:15:30.387]  And he said we got called because my job is to organize 10,000 Metro City buses.
[01:15:30.847 --> 01:15:34.190]  10,000 that hold 65 people each and that's regulations.
[01:15:34.210 --> 01:15:37.053]  You could fit about 100 people jam-packed, he said.
[01:15:39.957 --> 01:15:40.839]  20,000 Metro buses.
[01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:42.182]  That's a lot, folks.
[01:15:42.302 --> 01:15:43.685]  And for the entire East Coast.
[01:15:43.705 --> 01:15:44.708]  He goes, they have drills.
[01:15:45.048 --> 01:15:46.792]  They're going to evacuate the entire East Coast.
[01:15:47.853 --> 01:15:49.795]  And he goes, you're from Rhode Island.
[01:15:49.835 --> 01:15:50.295]  I'm like, yes.
[01:15:50.615 --> 01:15:55.199]  He goes, expect to have disaster drills in your area within the next couple weeks.
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:05.709]  And sure enough, folks, sure enough, when I went back to Rhode Island and hit the mainstream media, you know, the day it was happening, oh, they're doing disaster drills.
[01:16:06.469 --> 01:16:10.192]  Communications, earthquake, and right here,
[01:16:11.013 --> 01:16:15.116]  The article, Earthquake Disaster Drills, Mass FEMA's Martial Law Agenda.
[01:16:15.136 --> 01:16:16.737]  It's right there, folks.
[01:16:17.377 --> 01:16:19.798]  And I was told about this, weeks in advance.
[01:16:20.439 --> 01:16:26.603]  He told me there's going to be disaster drills for earthquakes and communications and all that in New England.
[01:16:27.003 --> 01:16:37.009]  And sure enough, folks, several cities around Rhode Island, Massachusetts and all that, FEMA and the National Guards are conducting exercises.
[01:16:38.732 --> 01:16:40.934]  Well, disaster drills for earthquakes.
[01:16:42.275 --> 01:16:46.639]  And you ask, well, why would they do a disaster drill for earthquakes in New England?
[01:16:47.219 --> 01:16:50.382]  Cuz it's unheard of of New England getting earthquakes.
[01:16:50.902 --> 01:16:57.007]  And sure enough, that was two nights ago, Maine got hit with a 4.9, I believe, earthquake.
[01:16:58.428 --> 01:17:04.754]  And the thing is, this guy told me from Homeland Security, he told me, okay, this stuff was coming, and it did.
[01:17:06.107 --> 01:17:08.808]  And we've been talking about the October surprise, the November surprise.
[01:17:08.868 --> 01:17:09.729]  Nobody knows what it is.
[01:17:09.829 --> 01:17:12.730]  I mean, it could be the whole presidential thing.
[01:17:12.790 --> 01:17:15.131]  It could be, it could be martial law.
[01:17:15.271 --> 01:17:15.792]  We don't know.
[01:17:16.912 --> 01:17:21.554]  But the thing is, I'm not trying to scare you folks, but this guy showed me, he laid out everything.
[01:17:22.014 --> 01:17:23.995]  And I asked him about the camps, the FEMA camps.
[01:17:24.416 --> 01:17:28.538]  Because I've been to one, I've seen one with my own eyes in Devons, Massachusetts.
[01:17:28.578 --> 01:17:32.900]  And if you go to Google, type in Fort Devon, Massachusetts, FMC.
[01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:34.881]  All right, that's one of them.
[01:17:35.301 --> 01:17:41.365]  Now, if you go west, southwest, or a couple miles southwest, there's a giant camp there.
[01:17:41.565 --> 01:17:42.926]  I've seen it with my own eyes, folks.
[01:17:43.606 --> 01:17:44.507]  A giant camp.
[01:17:45.287 --> 01:17:49.150]  They got the guard towers, everything's there, the trucks, but nobody's in there.
[01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:51.832]  And they were building another one a couple miles down the road.
[01:17:53.173 --> 01:17:54.894]  And he told me, he says, hold on a second.
[01:17:54.954 --> 01:18:01.478]  So he goes to his briefcase again, opens up, flips through the pages, and bam, there's a satellite view of the camp.
[01:18:04.096 --> 01:18:18.205]  And folks, you know, and you talk FEMA camps, folks, about to people, oh, here we go with the conspiracies, even though they admit it, right on record, the education, re-education camps, the internment camps, and hey, let me go over this for a minute.
[01:18:18.225 --> 01:18:30.153]  I don't know if we got any phone calls coming in, but yeah, we'll, you got the phone lines open, and before we have Bill Schnobel and I, but right here, folks, right from the horse's mouth, this is HR 645.
[01:18:33.387 --> 01:18:36.868]  The establishment of internment camps, FEMA camps, here in America.
[01:18:37.668 --> 01:18:42.089]  Now if you say this is a conspiracy, folks, this is right from Washington, D.C.
[01:18:43.969 --> 01:18:44.189]  H.R.
[01:18:44.409 --> 01:18:44.189]  645.
[01:18:44.569 --> 01:18:47.670]  The establishment of internment camps in America.
[01:18:47.710 --> 01:18:48.650]  Well, that's not it, though.
[01:18:49.290 --> 01:18:51.191]  So, you know, you still think this is a conspiracy.
[01:18:51.251 --> 01:18:51.951]  Here we go again.
[01:18:52.551 --> 01:18:54.491]  We got Army Regulations 210-35.
[01:18:54.531 --> 01:18:56.992]  The Civilian Inmate Labor Program.
[01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:13.206]  And this is a military document, and GoArmy.com, the National Guards, they were advertising for jobs for internment specialists to house American citizens and POWs, they say, but American citizens in these camps.
[01:19:14.926 --> 01:19:16.747]  And it's not that, I mean, we're not done yet.
[01:19:19.429 --> 01:19:22.531]  Endgame from the Department of Homeland Security.
[01:19:22.791 --> 01:19:29.375]  This is official Endgame Office of Detention and Strategic Plan of 2003 to 2012.
[01:19:29.775 --> 01:19:31.856]  And note they have 2012 at the end.
[01:19:32.337 --> 01:19:34.498]  And, you know, with the Homeland Security guy telling me this stuff.
[01:19:35.058 --> 01:19:36.799]  And 2012 is the Endgame, folks.
[01:19:37.219 --> 01:19:37.880]  You know what I mean?
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:48.066]  It was crazy, because after Alex Jones created the Endgame documentary, which is one of the best he has available on Infowarsstore.com, this came out not too soon afterwards.
[01:19:48.902 --> 01:19:49.942]  from Homeland Security.
[01:19:51.343 --> 01:19:53.284]  This is official endgame report, folks.
[01:19:53.624 --> 01:19:57.466]  They want to put American citizens in these detention camps.
[01:19:57.586 --> 01:19:59.026]  Put you to work forced labor.
[01:19:59.687 --> 01:20:00.507]  This ain't no joke.
[01:20:00.547 --> 01:20:04.629]  I mean, look what they did to the Japanese citizens back in World War II.
[01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:06.461]  That, for example.
[01:20:06.481 --> 01:20:07.141]  I mean, we got more.
[01:20:07.201 --> 01:20:10.944]  I mean, interment and resettlement operations.
[01:20:10.964 --> 01:20:14.686]  This is FM, Army Field Manual, 3-39.40.
[01:20:14.806 --> 01:20:18.329]  Interment and resettlement operations.
[01:20:18.529 --> 01:20:19.690]  Army Field Manuals, folks.
[01:20:19.710 --> 01:20:22.031]  If you want to get a document camera on that.
[01:20:23.152 --> 01:20:24.433]  Army Field Manuals, folks.
[01:20:24.793 --> 01:20:27.595]  Saying that they're going to put you in interment camps, folks.
[01:20:27.855 --> 01:20:28.796]  This is not a joke.
[01:20:30.902 --> 01:20:33.584]  Well, no, it's just a conspiracy, according to mainstream media.
[01:20:34.164 --> 01:20:38.387]  I mean, Manuel outlines plans to kill rioters and demonstrators in America.
[01:20:39.928 --> 01:20:41.749]  Oh, no, it's just a conspiracy, yeah.
[01:20:41.950 --> 01:20:42.650]  You didn't hear that.
[01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:44.371]  Oh, you didn't build that either, you know.
[01:20:45.032 --> 01:20:46.793]  You didn't hear that, you didn't build that, you didn't see that.
[01:20:47.053 --> 01:20:47.774]  Keep your mouth shut.
[01:20:48.654 --> 01:20:51.636]  And, yeah, I mean, I got tons of... I mean, I got a stack right here, folks.
[01:20:51.716 --> 01:20:54.018]  A stack of bills and documents and...
[01:20:56.411 --> 01:21:01.133]  We got three calls, so let's take Keith from Massachusetts, my hometown, New England.
[01:21:01.193 --> 01:21:01.853]  How you doing, Keith?
[01:21:02.914 --> 01:21:03.854]  I'm good, I'm good.
[01:21:03.874 --> 01:21:08.576]  Literally one-time listener, long-time listener, first-time caller.
[01:21:08.916 --> 01:21:09.716]  Thanks for calling.
[01:21:11.437 --> 01:21:21.301]  I've been debating on whether... I've been trying to call for a long, long time, and nobody seems to be answering.
[01:21:22.543 --> 01:21:25.445]  Well I've been delving into the Illuminati a lot and I've seen things
[01:21:46.954 --> 01:21:51.836]  Even before they happened, like the World Trade Center, on the back of the $20 bill.
[01:21:51.856 --> 01:21:55.157]  Yeah, there's a lot more to it.
[01:21:55.277 --> 01:21:56.457]  I've been trying to tell people too.
[01:22:08.154 --> 01:22:09.315]  Well, you know what this is part of?
[01:22:09.335 --> 01:22:12.217]  Every 9-11, every 11 years, there's a solar maximum.
[01:22:12.617 --> 01:22:20.182]  Now, this is a whole story all together, but every 11 years, you have to have this major ritual.
[01:22:20.202 --> 01:22:22.183]  This has been going on for thousands of years, but go ahead.
[01:22:22.203 --> 01:22:26.906]  My question is...
[01:22:28.576 --> 01:22:31.336]  Why hasn't anybody done anything about it?
[01:22:58.587 --> 01:23:00.688]  Yeah, and they blew up the World Trade Centers too.
[01:23:02.169 --> 01:23:02.970]  Unbelievable.
[01:23:03.230 --> 01:23:05.391]  It was all a false flag.
[01:23:07.873 --> 01:23:08.533]  Yeah, it's unbelievable.
[01:23:08.553 --> 01:23:16.138]  Yeah, and if you want to study more on Illuminati, my next guest coming on, his website is... I'm sorry, let me get the website here.
[01:23:16.839 --> 01:23:17.599]  I'll write it down.
[01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:25.886]  With OneAccord.org, and if you Google on YouTube, William Schnobland, exposing the Illuminati from within.
[01:23:25.987 --> 01:23:27.188]  I mean, this guy is amazing.
[01:23:27.708 --> 01:23:30.091]  And he answers a lot of your questions you're talking about, too.
[01:23:31.312 --> 01:23:32.593]  And also Doc Marquis.
[01:23:32.974 --> 01:23:35.316]  These two people, they're not on the mainstream.
[01:23:35.656 --> 01:23:37.398]  You know, nobody even recognizes them.
[01:23:38.619 --> 01:23:41.281]  It's withoneaccord.org.
[01:23:41.501 --> 01:23:47.044]  It's W-I-T-H-O-N-E-A-C-O-R-D.org.
[01:23:47.064 --> 01:23:50.806]  I mean, he's got some great books, too, and we're going to plug them when he gets done and everything.
[01:23:50.826 --> 01:23:55.709]  And if you want to call back to ask him a question, I mean, this guy was former Illuminati.
[01:23:55.769 --> 01:23:59.591]  I mean, you don't get any better than that, you know what I mean, talking about the Illuminati.
[01:23:59.611 --> 01:24:05.655]  So if you do want to call back, man, and ask William a question about an hour or so from now, you're welcome to do so.
[01:24:06.664 --> 01:24:07.284]  Oh, I will.
[01:24:07.885 --> 01:24:10.206]  And what part of Madison are you from?
[01:24:10.586 --> 01:24:13.187]  I'm actually from Springfield, but I live in Fall River now.
[01:24:13.627 --> 01:24:14.008]  Oh, okay.
[01:24:14.028 --> 01:24:15.788]  You used to live near Springfield for a few years.
[01:24:16.369 --> 01:24:16.749]  Oh, good.
[01:24:16.889 --> 01:24:17.970]  Well, thanks for calling, man.
[01:24:19.130 --> 01:24:20.211]  Yeah, no problem, man.
[01:24:20.311 --> 01:24:21.051]  God bless you, brother.
[01:24:21.071 --> 01:24:21.811]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:24:22.092 --> 01:24:22.612]  No problem.
[01:24:23.432 --> 01:24:26.434]  And we got Dalian from Alabama.
[01:24:26.954 --> 01:24:27.974]  Hey, how you doing, Dalian?
[01:24:28.935 --> 01:24:30.115]  Dalton, I'm sorry.
[01:24:30.135 --> 01:24:31.256]  The screen's hard to read over here.
[01:24:31.616 --> 01:24:33.537]  Dalton, are you there?
[01:24:33.557 --> 01:24:34.538]  Yeah, how's it going, man?
[01:24:34.818 --> 01:24:35.298]  Fine, how are you?
[01:24:36.317 --> 01:24:36.857]  Good, good.
[01:24:36.917 --> 01:24:38.118]  Thanks for taking my call, man.
[01:24:38.138 --> 01:24:38.918]  Oh, not a problem, man.
[01:24:39.839 --> 01:24:46.542]  Well, I've got some kind of a question to shoot at you about something me and a friend of mine were talking about earlier in the night.
[01:24:47.062 --> 01:24:48.983]  It was about those earthquake drills and stuff.
[01:24:49.043 --> 01:24:49.264]  Yep.
[01:24:50.144 --> 01:24:59.809]  And he had said that he had heard a story about how the, that there was some kind of a sinkhole in Louisiana and there was some sort of explosion down there.
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:08.217]  And he thought that it may be like pretenses of trying to get some sort of fault line activity to, you know,
[01:25:10.712 --> 01:25:11.372]  To cause damage.
[01:25:11.933 --> 01:25:13.714]  Oh yeah, that sinkhole in Louisiana.
[01:25:13.754 --> 01:25:18.036]  Somebody emailed me pictures and something about that a couple days ago.
[01:25:18.056 --> 01:25:20.918]  I didn't get much time to do the research.
[01:25:20.978 --> 01:25:24.740]  But yeah, he was also telling me about the explosions and all that.
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:27.182]  And I think that this is all part of this drill.
[01:25:27.222 --> 01:25:30.784]  And we know, they say, how do you drill an earthquake?
[01:25:31.344 --> 01:25:32.325]  How do you create an earthquake?
[01:25:32.365 --> 01:25:35.587]  We know through the weather modifications, HAWP and all that, this is possible.
[01:25:36.331 --> 01:25:38.572]  Yeah, I mean, it's proven and everything, but yeah.
[01:25:39.152 --> 01:25:40.453]  So, what's your take on that?
[01:25:41.733 --> 01:25:49.696]  Well, I mean, I haven't had enough time to really do a lot of research into it, so I just, you know, I thought it was an interesting, you know, take on that.
[01:25:50.876 --> 01:26:00.340]  And we all, you know, anytime we see them do drills for something, we know that, you know, it's a big possibility that they'll, you know, have some sort of, like, false flag or something like that.
[01:26:01.222 --> 01:26:02.965]  Uh, that's very similar to the drill.
[01:26:03.006 --> 01:26:04.729]  I mean, we've seen that time and time again.
[01:26:04.750 --> 01:26:09.580]  So, I mean, it was a legitimate concern, I felt, from the conversation.
[01:26:10.731 --> 01:26:10.991]  Wow.
[01:26:11.472 --> 01:26:14.675]  And have you noticed any military in the area conducting any drills?
[01:26:15.896 --> 01:26:16.396]  I haven't.
[01:26:16.777 --> 01:26:17.638]  I haven't appeared.
[01:26:17.658 --> 01:26:21.962]  So it'll be hard to notice because once in a while the mainstream media might cover it.
[01:26:22.362 --> 01:26:22.602]  Might.
[01:26:23.063 --> 01:26:24.924]  They might say, oh, they're doing a little disaster drill.
[01:26:25.165 --> 01:26:26.826]  And that won't make a big issue about it.
[01:26:26.846 --> 01:26:31.210]  It'll be like the bottom of the newspaper, a little article or on the TV or side issue.
[01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:33.533]  Oh, the military's doing disaster drills.
[01:26:33.593 --> 01:26:34.694]  So nobody's like, yeah, whatever.
[01:26:35.487 --> 01:26:54.134]  Yeah, and ever since Arizona and Mississippi both have been hit with a lot of crazy weather in the past, you know, decade, seeing a lot of military personnel, National Guard, that sort of thing, it's unfortunately, I think it's kind of a conditioning and people are, it's not as big of a deal as it once was, since those events.
[01:26:54.575 --> 01:26:54.795]  Yeah.
[01:26:55.879 --> 01:27:01.923]  And keep your eye out for that, because again, if you go on the internet, you'll find articles about it, you'll find little things about it.
[01:27:02.243 --> 01:27:03.543]  And go down and confront these people.
[01:27:03.784 --> 01:27:07.086]  I mean, take your video camera to your First Amendment to do so, do it peacefully.
[01:27:07.126 --> 01:27:09.487]  Go down and videotape these people, ask them, what are you doing?
[01:27:09.927 --> 01:27:10.828]  They have to answer you.
[01:27:10.888 --> 01:27:14.530]  I mean, I got videos on YouTube of myself doing this.
[01:27:14.670 --> 01:27:19.433]  I mean, it's your civil duty to say, hey, I'm paying your salary, pal, what are you doing here?
[01:27:19.973 --> 01:27:20.753]  What are you planning?
[01:27:20.934 --> 01:27:24.916]  And it's good keeping your eyes open, brother, and thanks for your call.
[01:27:25.931 --> 01:27:26.492]  Absolutely.
[01:27:26.972 --> 01:27:27.633]  One more thing.
[01:27:28.834 --> 01:27:41.648]  I'd like to say that I'm a huge fan of Bill coming up and I've been a fan of his from way back and I'd just like to say any first-time listeners being exposed to him, don't be scared off by some of the crazier things that he talks about.
[01:27:41.668 --> 01:27:44.751]  I legitimately think that it's probably all true.
[01:27:46.437 --> 01:27:49.380]  Oh awesome, and if you want to call back, ask Bill a question.
[01:27:49.660 --> 01:27:53.544]  At the end of our segment we're going to be taking phone calls and you can ask Bill a question.
[01:27:53.564 --> 01:28:00.411]  So yeah, definitely call back and tell the phone screener there that you want to talk to Bill and you already called.
[01:28:00.431 --> 01:28:01.492]  Alright, thanks for your call!
[01:28:04.637 --> 01:28:12.659]  And well, we gotta go to break in just about a minute, and when we come back, we're gonna have William Shnoblin, again, with OneAccord.org.
[01:28:12.739 --> 01:28:14.660]  I'm sorry, I can't remember that website for nothing.
[01:28:15.340 --> 01:28:18.881]  But with OneAccord.org, William Shnoblin, when we get back.
[01:28:19.381 --> 01:28:21.542]  And folks, this is some serious news, folks.
[01:28:21.602 --> 01:28:22.922]  I mean, I'm not even done yet.
[01:28:23.223 --> 01:28:25.683]  We're gonna cover the rest of the news after William Shnoblin.
[01:28:26.123 --> 01:28:31.085]  But when we get back, folks, William Shnoblin, and this is Dan Badandi for InfoWars.com.
[01:29:01.241 --> 01:29:03.623]  And here we are in our sales department.
[01:29:04.043 --> 01:29:06.825]  There are several people in this department, but right now only Will is here.
[01:29:07.245 --> 01:29:10.847]  Will handles sales for the newspaper as well as for the website.
[01:29:12.008 --> 01:29:13.769]  The websites, the radio, all nine yards.
[01:29:14.590 --> 01:29:15.991]  The websites, the radio as well.
[01:29:16.031 --> 01:29:16.611]  So here you go.
[01:29:16.691 --> 01:29:19.213]  Simple room, but they get a lot done here.
[01:30:04.815 --> 01:30:06.017]  So here we are in the warehouse.
[01:30:06.117 --> 01:30:08.881]  Obviously you see just mountains of DVDs.
[01:30:08.901 --> 01:30:11.525]  This is your shirts over here.
[01:30:11.986 --> 01:30:15.751]  Anything that is ordered, this is where it's shipped from.
[01:30:23.223 --> 01:30:23.763]  Okay, hello.
[01:30:23.803 --> 01:30:28.084]  Kindly introduce yourself and tell us a little bit about your job description here at InfoWars.
[01:30:28.324 --> 01:30:31.525]  I'm Christy Hightower and I actually am site moderator for Planet InfoWars.
[01:30:31.625 --> 01:30:36.426]  You might have seen me on some of the updates we do or the Ask Alex segment.
[01:30:36.966 --> 01:30:43.627]  So if you're actually into the Ask Alex segment, you have questions for him, go ahead and send those to the group on Planet InfoWars.
[01:30:43.667 --> 01:30:46.668]  And also we're going to actually do a live stream of it at 10 a.m.
[01:30:46.708 --> 01:30:48.228]  on Friday, so that'll be fun.
[01:30:48.248 --> 01:30:50.909]  Now Christy, what do you enjoy most about your job?
[01:30:52.145 --> 01:30:53.707]  Talking to you guys, actually.
[01:30:53.907 --> 01:30:54.708]  That's the best part.
[01:30:55.009 --> 01:31:05.602]  Because the information and the links and things that you guys provide and the cool stories and articles that you write yourselves are always really entertaining and usually really educational.
[01:31:05.722 --> 01:31:06.563]  So, thank you.
[01:31:07.425 --> 01:31:09.928]  Now, how has this operation grown since you've been here, Christy?
[01:31:10.390 --> 01:31:11.770]  Alright, so it exploded.
[01:31:11.790 --> 01:31:19.793]  I think I got here six, seven months ago, and about two months into me being here, it was like a quiet little office, and then all of a sudden, boom!
[01:31:19.873 --> 01:31:22.434]  Like, the girls' bathroom can't even use it.
[01:31:22.454 --> 01:31:23.674]  I have to go all the way around the building.
[01:31:23.694 --> 01:31:25.315]  I mean, that's just a fun example, I guess.
[01:31:25.455 --> 01:31:29.516]  There's so many new people getting hired on, and they're all amazing.
[01:31:29.556 --> 01:31:32.937]  Is there any last thing you'd like to say to viewers who are watching the Money Bomb?
[01:31:33.633 --> 01:31:34.694]  Oh, that's a great question.
[01:31:35.434 --> 01:31:37.076]  Yeah, I'm glad that you're tuning in.
[01:31:37.316 --> 01:31:40.538]  Thanks for supporting the InfoWars and keep up your activism.
[01:31:40.598 --> 01:31:44.841]  So, I'll be paying attention if you guys post stuff on PlanetInfoWars.com.
[01:31:48.464 --> 01:31:54.328]  Every time InfoWars needs to be updated, they update it right here.
[01:31:54.368 --> 01:31:58.171]  So whenever there's a new article, this is where they post it.
[01:32:30.976 --> 01:32:33.378]  Two days to wake up the world money bomb.
[01:32:35.019 --> 01:32:36.160]  Call in to donate.
[01:32:36.180 --> 01:32:36.640]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:32:36.660 --> 01:32:37.140]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:37.301]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:32:37.481 --> 01:32:41.263]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now.
[01:32:41.283 --> 01:32:42.644]  No matter how hard you try,
[01:33:15.777 --> 01:33:16.117]  Yeah!
[01:33:16.217 --> 01:33:19.480]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now, New World Order!
[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:21.261]  We are going fast at you!
[01:33:21.321 --> 01:33:22.222]  We're the tip of the spear!
[01:33:22.262 --> 01:33:24.083]  We're coming right through you!
[01:33:24.263 --> 01:33:25.924]  Not at you, through you!
[01:33:25.944 --> 01:33:27.425]  So folks, keep it going, man.
[01:33:27.606 --> 01:33:30.407]  We got $108,000, folks, on the InfoWars Money Bomb.
[01:33:30.768 --> 01:33:32.749]  Again, if you want to call to donate, 1-877-789-ALEX.
[01:33:32.829 --> 01:33:33.029]  That's 2-5...
[01:33:37.092 --> 01:33:41.794]  And again, New World Order, no matter how hard you try, you're not going to stop us now.
[01:33:42.034 --> 01:33:44.595]  Because we're blasting through the tyranny!
[01:33:44.615 --> 01:33:46.456]  We're blasting through with liberty!
[01:33:46.496 --> 01:33:47.076]  Yeah!
[01:33:50.698 --> 01:33:52.238]  That's because we're the renegades, baby!
[01:33:52.458 --> 01:33:56.480]  We're the renegades against the New World Order, against the system, and we're taking you down!
[01:34:01.397 --> 01:34:07.319]  And folks, we got William Shnobin about to join us in about 10 seconds from now, and first I want to discuss something.
[01:34:07.979 --> 01:34:11.460]  When I said the top priority is the Illuminati, and this is what they are at, folks.
[01:34:11.580 --> 01:34:19.522]  I mean, if you read the writings of Adam Weisshop and everything else, one, they want the destruction of Christianity in all monarchical governments.
[01:34:20.442 --> 01:34:25.983]  And two, the destruction of nations such as favoring universal unitarianism.
[01:34:26.483 --> 01:34:37.246]  And three, the discouragement of patriotic and loyal effort branded in narrow-minded prejudice incomparable with tenets of goodwill to all men and cry of universal brotherhood.
[01:34:37.266 --> 01:34:44.828]  And four, the abolishing, I'm sorry, to abolish family ties and marriages by means of systematic corruption.
[01:34:44.868 --> 01:34:45.348]  And five,
[01:34:45.908 --> 01:34:48.850]  The suppression of the rights of inheritance and property.
[01:34:48.890 --> 01:34:50.071]  They want your private property.
[01:34:50.351 --> 01:34:51.552]  They want to abolish marriage.
[01:34:51.592 --> 01:34:52.793]  Folks, does this sound familiar?
[01:34:53.573 --> 01:35:00.838]  Agenda 21, United Nations openly calling to abolish private property with the sustainability.
[01:35:00.878 --> 01:35:05.000]  Melissa Melton, she's a great reporter on this stuff and sustainability agenda 21.
[01:35:05.481 --> 01:35:13.086]  But without further ado, William Schnobland, former Illuminati, real Illuminati folks, former Illuminati, former satanic priest.
[01:35:13.826 --> 01:35:17.771]  Former Catholic priest and former cultist, magician and everything else.
[01:35:18.191 --> 01:35:19.353]  And William, how you doing brother?
[01:35:20.547 --> 01:35:21.268]  Doing real well.
[01:35:21.388 --> 01:35:22.248]  It's great to be here.
[01:35:22.548 --> 01:35:28.392]  Yeah, it's great to see you, man, and I'm happy to have you on because I know that you never get the respect you deserve.
[01:35:28.652 --> 01:35:40.540]  I mean, I know you're not out for all the glitz and glamour and all that stuff, but you need to be highlighted because I've been studying you for about four years now, all your work and everything.
[01:35:40.580 --> 01:35:46.504]  I learned a lot from you, a great deal, and you need to be on the spotlight because the world needs to hear your information.
[01:35:47.205 --> 01:35:48.387]  Well, thank you very much.
[01:35:48.427 --> 01:35:49.268]  I appreciate that.
[01:35:49.669 --> 01:35:50.210]  No problem.
[01:35:51.352 --> 01:35:53.695]  And, uh, you want to tell us a basic brief history about yourself?
[01:35:53.715 --> 01:35:54.677]  A little introduction?
[01:35:54.977 --> 01:35:56.760]  You know, besides what I gave you and everything else.
[01:35:57.987 --> 01:36:03.288]  Well, basically I started out life wanting to serve God.
[01:36:03.308 --> 01:36:04.789]  I was born and raised Catholic.
[01:36:05.789 --> 01:36:10.550]  I went to the minor seminary while I was studying to be a priest.
[01:36:11.210 --> 01:36:16.511]  I had a guy, a professor who was a Catholic priest, turn me on to the occult, believe it or not.
[01:36:17.211 --> 01:36:19.152]  And he told me that, you know,
[01:36:20.612 --> 01:36:30.618]  The Lord was a priest, a magician, an occultist, and if I wanted to be like, quote-unquote, another Christ, I should also pursue the occult.
[01:36:30.658 --> 01:36:37.262]  Now, of course, that's utter nonsense, but I was only like 19 years old at the time, you know, college-like.
[01:36:37.702 --> 01:36:38.382]  What would I know?
[01:36:38.943 --> 01:36:40.424]  And so I started doing that.
[01:36:41.024 --> 01:36:47.488]  And when I finally got out of the college, had my degree, I was a first-degree witch.
[01:36:48.328 --> 01:36:50.810]  And from there, I studied with the Druids.
[01:36:52.191 --> 01:36:56.454]  I was personally initiated by the Grand Master Druid of North America.
[01:36:56.474 --> 01:36:58.115]  This is all in the early 70s.
[01:36:59.036 --> 01:37:06.401]  Got involved with Freemasonry on his advice that it would be a very Luciferian thing to do.
[01:37:06.822 --> 01:37:09.904]  And got involved in the Church of Satan.
[01:37:10.384 --> 01:37:12.586]  Got involved in hardcore Satanism.
[01:37:12.646 --> 01:37:16.829]  And I think we need to talk a little bit more about some of these things, obviously.
[01:37:16.889 --> 01:37:17.369]  Oh, definitely.
[01:37:17.389 --> 01:37:18.030]  You got the floor.
[01:37:18.070 --> 01:37:21.712]  I mean, whatever you want to bring up, because what you have to say is very important information.
[01:37:21.752 --> 01:37:23.493]  And, folks, he's got the certificates.
[01:37:23.553 --> 01:37:28.536]  If you go on YouTube, exposing the Illuminati from within, he goes all over the country, does seminars.
[01:37:28.716 --> 01:37:31.598]  He's got the actual certificates to prove his worth.
[01:37:31.698 --> 01:37:34.840]  I mean, like, he's got one from the Church of Satan.
[01:37:34.860 --> 01:37:36.741]  It was signed by Anton LaVey.
[01:37:36.761 --> 01:37:39.663]  You know, he was a satanic priest.
[01:37:40.163 --> 01:37:40.864]  Was, thank God.
[01:37:40.884 --> 01:37:41.324]  You know what I mean?
[01:37:41.384 --> 01:37:42.765]  Thank God you're on the good side now.
[01:37:42.825 --> 01:37:43.746]  And I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:37:44.741 --> 01:37:45.422]  No, that's fine.
[01:37:45.922 --> 01:37:59.131]  I just was saying, you know, that I, during that time of getting into hardcore Satanism, I got an invitation to join the Illuminati, which we can get into in greater detail if you're interested.
[01:37:59.211 --> 01:38:02.073]  But, because people wonder, well, how do you get into the Illuminati?
[01:38:02.093 --> 01:38:04.515]  You know, obviously you can be born into it.
[01:38:05.075 --> 01:38:08.098]  But there are other considerations involved in my case.
[01:38:08.358 --> 01:38:12.462]  And partly it was because of all the Masonic involvement I had.
[01:38:12.502 --> 01:38:21.751]  I mean, I was involved in esoteric Freemasonry, which is continental Masonry from Europe, not just the stuff that people are familiar with here in America.
[01:38:22.512 --> 01:38:29.378]  But things like the Rite of Memphis Misery and the Rite of Grand Orient and some of those things were very, very ungodly things.
[01:38:29.398 --> 01:38:42.469]  Well anyhow, I'm going along like this and ultimately I was pretty deep in even the point of being drinking human blood and being involved with vampirism and stuff like that and
[01:38:43.850 --> 01:38:45.972]  A lady prayed for me.
[01:38:46.512 --> 01:38:51.736]  She saw a check that I'd written to the Church of Satan, my yearly dues, you know.
[01:38:52.417 --> 01:39:00.043]  And she wrote on the back of the check, you know, and she sent it back from the bank where the Church of Satan did its banking at that time.
[01:39:00.063 --> 01:39:01.224]  It was in San Francisco.
[01:39:01.864 --> 01:39:04.066]  And she said, I'll be praying for you in the name of Jesus.
[01:39:06.041 --> 01:39:09.908]  When she started praying for me, literally within a couple of days, my whole life fell apart.
[01:39:10.890 --> 01:39:16.400]  And I basically cried out to Lucifer, because I thought he was the true God at that time.
[01:39:16.420 --> 01:39:18.223]  I cried out for a sign from him.
[01:39:19.535 --> 01:39:37.848]  And instead of, you know, something wonderful happening from the standpoint of the dark side, the Almighty arranged for me to have a visit from two young girls who were Satanists all the way from Chicago, and they brought me Christian comic books about the dangers of the occult.
[01:39:38.428 --> 01:39:47.875]  I mean, that's the kind of awesome deity that we serve, that he was able to actually bring a witness in the form of two teenage Satanists.
[01:39:48.555 --> 01:39:56.881]  And they brought these comic books, and I basically kind of sneered at them and didn't really want to look at them, unfortunately.
[01:39:56.901 --> 01:40:02.805]  But, I mean, I know all of this is from the Lord, because the next day,
[01:40:03.766 --> 01:40:05.526]  Mormon missionaries showed up at our door.
[01:40:06.087 --> 01:40:13.108]  And that's going to be a part of what we're speaking about tonight, is the whole issue of Romney and the Mormon Church and how that ties into the Illuminati.
[01:40:13.968 --> 01:40:25.911]  But to be brief, right now, we had been told years earlier that if you want to really have the ultimate Luciferian experience, join the Mormon Church.
[01:40:25.971 --> 01:40:28.891]  That was the words of this high-level Druid guy.
[01:40:29.491 --> 01:40:31.552]  And so we joined the church.
[01:40:32.808 --> 01:40:35.050]  And was involved for five years.
[01:40:35.791 --> 01:40:36.932]  I became an elder.
[01:40:36.992 --> 01:40:38.854]  I became an Elder's Forum President.
[01:40:39.275 --> 01:40:41.237]  I taught for the church.
[01:40:41.997 --> 01:40:47.603]  I was a home teacher, obviously, which, you know, is a kind of pastoral dissertation program they have.
[01:40:48.164 --> 01:40:49.145]  And they went to the temple.
[01:40:49.785 --> 01:40:55.347]  And I went to the Salt Lake Temple, and that's a whole other line of discussion if you want to have it.
[01:40:55.447 --> 01:40:58.769]  But, you know, Mormonism is not what it seems.
[01:40:59.109 --> 01:41:09.293]  And in my case, the Almighty used those five years of Mormonism to get me to the point where I was reading the Bible, where I knew I was a sinner.
[01:41:10.214 --> 01:41:18.563]  And in 1984, I finally realized that the world's greatest anti-Mormon book is the King James Bible, which ironically they use.
[01:41:18.603 --> 01:41:20.785]  That's their official Bible.
[01:41:21.426 --> 01:41:29.135]  So anyway, I remember those comic books and that there was something in the back about how to get born again.
[01:41:30.736 --> 01:41:33.299]  And that was on June 22nd, 1984, and I've never looked back.
[01:41:33.339 --> 01:41:33.619]  Hallelujah.
[01:41:48.939 --> 01:41:50.100]  Thank you, thank you.
[01:41:50.300 --> 01:41:58.485]  I mean, it's amazing because, like, um, I mean, you can see in the Bible, too, all the prophets, all, you know, disciples, they were all murderers.
[01:41:58.525 --> 01:41:59.926]  They were into the occult themselves.
[01:41:59.946 --> 01:42:00.827]  They were pagans.
[01:42:00.967 --> 01:42:05.570]  I mean, they had a hard life and, um, and they got transformed by God.
[01:42:05.690 --> 01:42:07.331]  I mean, people out there don't believe in God.
[01:42:07.351 --> 01:42:07.651]  You know what?
[01:42:07.871 --> 01:42:10.393]  You need to get your priorities straight because this is real stuff.
[01:42:10.693 --> 01:42:13.835]  And regardless what you believe, folks, the people who run this planet,
[01:42:14.335 --> 01:42:15.796]  They're not atheists at all, folks.
[01:42:15.997 --> 01:42:17.578]  They are Illuminati, okay?
[01:42:17.598 --> 01:42:20.701]  They are Luciferian worshipping scum, bottom line.
[01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:21.722]  And, um, go ahead, Bill.
[01:42:22.823 --> 01:42:24.424]  Well, yes, that's absolutely true.
[01:42:24.624 --> 01:42:33.032]  And, you know, the problem is, um, is that many people that are fighting this stuff, they think they can do that with physical weapons.
[01:42:33.132 --> 01:42:39.657]  And I remember many, many years ago, I'm sure, uh, some of your listeners and viewers are familiar with Lyndon LaRouche.
[01:42:40.518 --> 01:42:49.704]  And his organization asked me to give a talk for them, of all people, you know, because they're kind of a sort of an odd political sect.
[01:42:50.445 --> 01:42:56.789]  And he had made the statement, this is probably in 1988 or 1990, that he was going to kill Satan.
[01:42:57.269 --> 01:42:59.831]  He, Lyndon LaRouche, was going to kill Satan.
[01:43:00.631 --> 01:43:03.252]  And take over the world for the good guys.
[01:43:04.132 --> 01:43:11.133]  And I just kind of got up there, and as a minister of the gospel, I had to tell him, you know, nobody's going to kill Satan except Yeshua.
[01:43:11.753 --> 01:43:12.373]  Exactly.
[01:43:13.273 --> 01:43:27.856]  And, you know, if you think you can come up against spiritual enemies with physical weapons, you're going to be in the position of, you know, like Native Americans in a war canoe coming up against a battleship.
[01:43:28.556 --> 01:43:31.398]  Because, you know, it's a whole different level of warfare.
[01:43:31.418 --> 01:43:32.158]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:43:32.458 --> 01:43:33.719]  It's a spiritual war.
[01:43:33.759 --> 01:43:38.742]  I mean, like the Bible says in Ephesians, we don't wrestle against flesh but powers of principality and darkness.
[01:43:39.950 --> 01:43:40.850]  Absolutely.
[01:43:40.870 --> 01:43:41.971]  And that's where we need to be.
[01:43:42.051 --> 01:43:48.332]  Not that, you know, there aren't practical things we can do down here on the earth plane, too, but we need to be praying.
[01:43:48.392 --> 01:43:50.573]  We need to really be interceding for this nation.
[01:43:50.613 --> 01:43:59.955]  And if there's nothing else that comes out of this, that's what I want to say tonight, is that prayer is vital right now, because I think we're on a very important turning point.
[01:44:00.635 --> 01:44:04.916]  And I think that there's nothing that can be said that's more important than that.
[01:44:06.792 --> 01:44:07.353]  Exactly.
[01:44:08.253 --> 01:44:10.035]  That's an incredible story, man.
[01:44:10.135 --> 01:44:12.878]  I've seen your seminars at the Prophecy Club.
[01:44:13.158 --> 01:44:16.961]  If you guys want to plug his website, it's on the computer right there, right on number 8.
[01:44:17.382 --> 01:44:30.294]  Again, with OneAccord.org, if you want to talk about those three books, you've got Throne of Fools, and definitely plug those books because there's important information in those books.
[01:44:32.047 --> 01:44:41.312]  The one you were talking about earlier, it's actually a DVD, it's Throne of Fools, and it kind of discusses the fact that we've got, you know, Obama versus Romney.
[01:44:41.432 --> 01:44:47.175]  Once again, the powers that be have set us up with one devil versus another devil.
[01:44:47.835 --> 01:44:50.937]  And the question becomes, then, what do you do with something like that?
[01:44:51.537 --> 01:44:57.060]  And, you know, I try to write some answers, you know, from the standpoint of, is one better than the other?
[01:44:58.701 --> 01:45:08.692]  Choosing the lesser of two evils, and I think it's a very important message for right now, being that we're so close now to the election, and it looks as though Romney's pulling ahead.
[01:45:09.473 --> 01:45:12.957]  Another thing that we have talking about prayer is we have
[01:45:13.738 --> 01:45:24.505]  A book on spiritual warfare, Blood on the Doorposts, which as many people have said is one of the best books on how to do warfare against these dark forces and also how to be set free.
[01:45:24.545 --> 01:45:28.487]  Well, that's very important and the other thing is a lot of Christians lack this, folks.
[01:45:28.747 --> 01:45:32.790]  I mean, Christians of regular churches, I mean, it's great to hear about Jesus, but
[01:45:33.570 --> 01:45:38.991]  You know, if you go to a church and a year goes by, two years, you hear the same messages over and over and over.
[01:45:39.051 --> 01:45:40.892]  But they never get into spiritual warfare.
[01:45:41.292 --> 01:45:44.372]  I mean, especially the 501c3 churches, they don't want you to know none of this stuff.
[01:45:44.873 --> 01:45:50.774]  Spiritual warfare, folks, is the most important thing a Christian should be getting to and knowing.
[01:45:50.854 --> 01:45:55.875]  Because, again, we battle against powers of principalities and darkness, not against flesh.
[01:45:56.235 --> 01:46:00.537]  I mean, these people like the Rothschilds, Obama, Romney, these are just puppets.
[01:46:00.577 --> 01:46:01.218]  That's all they are.
[01:46:01.538 --> 01:46:05.120]  It's the evil above them that control them is what you've got to battle.
[01:46:06.380 --> 01:46:08.281]  Yes, that's absolutely correct.
[01:46:08.562 --> 01:46:11.463]  And that's the problem, is that a lot of people don't understand that.
[01:46:11.943 --> 01:46:19.968]  They don't realize that basically you're looking at sock puppets up there in the media, whether they're media personalities or... Smelly ones, too.
[01:46:22.366 --> 01:46:24.589]  Yes, unfortunately that's often the case.
[01:46:25.209 --> 01:46:26.951]  So, yeah, it's very critical.
[01:46:27.211 --> 01:46:33.599]  And the other thing, you know, of course, the book that probably made me famous is the book on masonry here.
[01:46:33.959 --> 01:46:35.581]  This happens to be a first edition.
[01:46:35.641 --> 01:46:37.083]  The cover looks a little different now.
[01:46:37.103 --> 01:46:38.364]  You want to hold it up a little higher?
[01:46:38.584 --> 01:46:39.305]  Yeah, sorry.
[01:46:39.325 --> 01:46:40.466]  A little bit more.
[01:46:41.487 --> 01:46:50.869]  Masonry Beyond the Light basically talks about why masonry is dangerous for anybody, especially for Christians.
[01:46:51.289 --> 01:47:03.412]  Virtually every day we get phone calls about families whose lives have been ruined because of a husband or a grandparent or something being involved in a Masonic Lodge.
[01:47:04.192 --> 01:47:06.453]  I was in it myself for nine years.
[01:47:07.373 --> 01:47:16.543]  And I'll tell you, it is one of the most spiritually toxic, dangerous, diabolical organizations on this planet, because it's basically a feeding program for the Illuminati.
[01:47:16.663 --> 01:47:25.252]  Oh, and if I'm correct here, the Blue Lodge is the first three degrees, and that's where they suck a lot of Christians in, and they have a Bible on the altar, and say, oh yeah...
[01:47:25.752 --> 01:47:26.972]  We believe in higher power.
[01:47:26.992 --> 01:47:27.633]  You can believe in God.
[01:47:27.673 --> 01:47:28.793]  Come on in and they suck.
[01:47:29.333 --> 01:47:32.054]  We got a picture of Alistair Crowley up on screen.
[01:47:32.354 --> 01:47:33.094]  Candace Crowley.
[01:47:34.915 --> 01:47:38.216]  I think it's Alistair Crowley resurrected with a wig on.
[01:47:38.236 --> 01:47:40.717]  If you ask me, this girl's a witch.
[01:47:40.737 --> 01:47:41.817]  She really is.
[01:47:42.678 --> 01:47:46.519]  If you can see on screen when you watch the replay, we got a picture of Alistair Crowley
[01:47:47.199 --> 01:47:48.600]  Well, Devil's Fangs on it.
[01:47:48.620 --> 01:47:49.541]  I mean, it's great.
[01:47:49.561 --> 01:47:51.583]  But yeah, Alistair Crowley was a big part of this.
[01:47:51.623 --> 01:47:54.786]  But yeah, Masonry, they draw Christians in.
[01:47:54.826 --> 01:47:57.148]  They say they're a Christian organization.
[01:47:57.548 --> 01:47:59.029]  And they even pastors.
[01:47:59.069 --> 01:48:02.953]  How many pastors do you know, Mr. Schnobel, that are Masons?
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:10.790]  Well, it was said at one time, I don't know if this is still true, that 40% of the Southern Baptist Convention pastors are Freemasons.
[01:48:11.551 --> 01:48:18.259]  So, when you consider that's the largest Protestant denomination in America, and it's not the only one, I don't mean to pick on them, but
[01:48:18.820 --> 01:48:27.504]  I think most of the mainline churches, you know, the Lutherans, Episcopalians, have an awful lot of masons among their deacons and their pastors and their elders.
[01:48:27.564 --> 01:48:31.826]  And that's really bad because you have a headship issue then.
[01:48:32.206 --> 01:48:38.108]  These people are the spiritual head of the flock and, you know, nasty material flows downhill.
[01:48:38.668 --> 01:48:39.489]  And that's the problem.
[01:48:40.309 --> 01:48:43.130]  Is that they're defiling their flocks.
[01:48:43.170 --> 01:48:47.990]  They're like the idle shepherds that are being warned about in the prophetic writings of the Bible.
[01:48:48.030 --> 01:48:50.311]  You know, that do not take care of the sheep.
[01:48:51.031 --> 01:49:02.813]  And as a result, we have all of these issues on our hands and why the church has basically lost a lot of its clout in America is because we're full of Norman Vincent Peale type pastors.
[01:49:02.893 --> 01:49:05.493]  And of course, Norman Vincent Peale was a 33rd degree mason.
[01:49:07.194 --> 01:49:07.634]  Unbelievable.
[01:49:07.654 --> 01:49:09.114]  And now, a lot of masons
[01:49:12.594 --> 01:49:13.175]  ...degree now.
[01:49:13.635 --> 01:49:20.301]  A lot of people don't know, like I said, about the ancient rite of Memphis Miseram that goes up to the 99th degree.
[01:49:20.321 --> 01:49:21.002]  Am I correct on that?
[01:49:21.943 --> 01:49:23.965]  Uh, actually there's 360 degrees in it.
[01:49:24.285 --> 01:49:24.845]  Unbelievable.
[01:49:24.946 --> 01:49:26.147]  And you are a 90th degree?
[01:49:26.427 --> 01:49:26.987]  Is that right?
[01:49:27.007 --> 01:49:27.108]  Yes.
[01:49:27.368 --> 01:49:27.648]  Yes.
[01:49:28.449 --> 01:49:28.849]  That's correct.
[01:49:28.869 --> 01:49:29.250]  Unbelievable.
[01:49:29.929 --> 01:49:40.351]  Yeah, well, I had a gentleman, well, I use the word advisedly, come all the way from France to bring me into the higher levels of esoteric Freemasonry.
[01:49:40.391 --> 01:49:42.211]  That was, of course, back in the 70s.
[01:49:42.351 --> 01:49:49.453]  But it's dangerous stuff because the higher you get in Masonry, the more you see it's anti-Christian.
[01:49:49.513 --> 01:49:53.773]  Like the right, the Grand Orient right, is extremely anti-Christian.
[01:49:54.474 --> 01:49:56.474]  And the Masonry we see in America
[01:49:57.174 --> 01:50:03.958]  It's just, it's kind of been cleaned up a little on the outside, but actually it's just as bad.
[01:50:04.039 --> 01:50:07.561]  It's just got a better public relations arm in America.
[01:50:08.683 --> 01:50:09.424]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:50:09.484 --> 01:50:14.368]  And you know, Masonry again, I mean, they promise light but provide darkness.
[01:50:14.388 --> 01:50:20.012]  That was John Quincy Adams, I believe, when he, the sixth president of the United States, when he quoted about Freemasonry.
[01:50:20.212 --> 01:50:24.295]  You know, he says, Freemasonry promises light but is darkness.
[01:50:24.415 --> 01:50:26.417]  And I think that's exactly what I'm not sure about.
[01:50:26.777 --> 01:50:31.821]  You know, even our founding fathers, some of them try to warn us about Masonry and, you know, it's destructive.
[01:50:31.881 --> 01:50:32.322]  It really is.
[01:50:33.649 --> 01:50:58.256]  Well, yes, because it's kind of become our civil religion, and like I was involved in the production of a video, The Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings, and the New Atlantis, and we document in that series, you know, how even though everybody says, oh, America's a Christian nation, well, if it is, then why are all the buildings in our nation's capital full of pagan symbols?
[01:50:58.416 --> 01:51:09.123]  And by the way, we got that set, I think on Infowarsstore.com, the whole set, America's Biggest Secret Beginnings, and I watched them all, and I watched them three times, actually, and a lot of information.
[01:51:09.163 --> 01:51:11.725]  You, Doc Marquis, I mean, you guys are great.
[01:51:11.805 --> 01:51:15.728]  I mean, especially exposing secret stuff, especially the architecture.
[01:51:15.788 --> 01:51:21.011]  I mean, like, if anybody sees, you know, you got Rome, you know, the Vatican, you got Washington, D.C., and Paris, France.
[01:51:21.311 --> 01:51:23.012]  There is nothing godly about that.
[01:51:23.032 --> 01:51:25.174]  I mean, you got obelisks for Osiris.
[01:51:25.274 --> 01:51:28.116]  I mean, like, you got, you know, they're built under the
[01:51:28.896 --> 01:51:32.138]  The three stars and the seven stars are some Masonic stuff.
[01:51:32.378 --> 01:51:33.499]  The blazing dog star.
[01:51:33.519 --> 01:51:40.143]  I mean, it's all architecture built to promote the coming of the new age, the coming of the Aquarius, the coming of the Antichrist.
[01:51:41.244 --> 01:51:42.405]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:51:42.425 --> 01:51:48.088]  And even, you know, we have the Washington Monument, which is the world's largest obelisk, as I understand it.
[01:51:48.108 --> 01:51:51.951]  555 feet tall, and it represents death and resurrection.
[01:51:52.799 --> 01:51:56.241]  Yes, but not what Christians think of as death and resurrection.
[01:51:56.281 --> 01:51:56.781]  Exactly.
[01:51:57.201 --> 01:52:01.384]  It's actually a giant phallic symbol, because that is the god of Freemasonry.
[01:52:01.844 --> 01:52:09.168]  And see, that spiritual fact, which most Masons don't understand, is what makes Masonry so wicked, is its Baal worship.
[01:52:09.628 --> 01:52:11.890]  It's the worship of the false god Baal.
[01:52:12.590 --> 01:52:17.413]  And because of that, a lot of men who become Masons, even if they're good men,
[01:52:18.794 --> 01:52:21.596]  They end up being seduced into perverse activities.
[01:52:22.416 --> 01:52:26.500]  And we're coming out now with a brand new DVD.
[01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:27.981]  It'll be out probably within a week.
[01:52:28.001 --> 01:52:31.363]  It's called Free Masonry, Failing the First Degree.
[01:52:31.844 --> 01:52:38.989]  And in that DVD, I talk about the fact that, you know, even in first degree, Mason has just gone through the very first level of Blue Lodge.
[01:52:39.009 --> 01:52:42.432]  And you're right, the Blue Lodge is foundational to everything else.
[01:52:43.452 --> 01:52:45.754]  They have knelt at the altar of Baal.
[01:52:45.794 --> 01:52:48.517]  They have sworn an oath that is forbidden in the Bible.
[01:52:49.037 --> 01:52:54.182]  And because of that, the doorways of their lives are blown open to all manner of evil.
[01:52:54.202 --> 01:52:59.407]  And you have so many cases, I mean literally hundreds and hundreds of cases we've heard over the years of...
[01:53:00.851 --> 01:53:06.976]  Of families where the father has gotten involved in pedophilia, child abuse, things of that nature.
[01:53:07.017 --> 01:53:09.819]  Just very, very, very unsavory stuff.
[01:53:09.959 --> 01:53:10.840]  Sinful things.
[01:53:11.180 --> 01:53:13.562]  Things that just ruin families and that ruin lives.
[01:53:13.642 --> 01:53:14.263]  Absolutely.
[01:53:14.483 --> 01:53:19.427]  In the book of Matthew alone, I mean, the book of Matthew warns you about taking sworn oaths upon your blood.
[01:53:19.467 --> 01:53:25.673]  I mean, every degree, you're swearing your blood upon this, and you conduct a ritual and everything.
[01:53:26.194 --> 01:53:29.780]  And about keeping things a secret because Jesus says, have I kept anything a secret?
[01:53:30.041 --> 01:53:34.849]  I mean a book of Matthew alone just destroys the whole philosophical view of masonry.
[01:53:35.638 --> 01:53:37.099]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:53:37.960 --> 01:53:47.629]  So that's a very big part of why the church has lost its punch, is that there's so many Masonic pastors and so many Masonic members.
[01:53:48.450 --> 01:53:56.797]  And I mean, you know, the famous evangelist Dwight Moody, in the 19th century, he said that as long as there was masonry in the church, there would be no revival.
[01:53:57.518 --> 01:54:15.974]  And that only when Masonry was cast out of the church, and people were told either get out of the lodge or get out of the church by courageous pastors, that the church would just sort of be sitting there, simmering, lukewarm, with no real moves of the Holy Spirit being able to happen.
[01:54:16.587 --> 01:54:26.334]  I got a friend in Pennsylvania, he's a reverend, and they're writing, I don't want to say where he's from or his name or whatever, because he was telling me that's Masonic town where he's from.
[01:54:26.854 --> 01:54:30.237]  And basically, everybody's a Mason just about, and he's scared.
[01:54:30.397 --> 01:54:34.880]  I mean, him as a Mason, he spoke all about Masonry, and he got his life threatened.
[01:54:35.340 --> 01:54:38.903]  I mean, they even beat him up a couple times, and they told him to keep his mouth shut about it.
[01:54:39.263 --> 01:54:42.806]  But the thing is, he still goes on with it, and he's a brave man, but I mean,
[01:54:43.327 --> 01:54:47.077]  A lot of pastors are not aware of the dangers of masonry.
[01:54:47.237 --> 01:54:50.365]  I mean, like, how many churches out there have masons as pastors?
[01:54:51.809 --> 01:54:54.450]  Well, it's really, it's a scandal.
[01:54:54.590 --> 01:55:00.131]  And it's a scandal in the body of Christ to have these kind of false shepherds.
[01:55:00.331 --> 01:55:02.772]  And unfortunately, at first, they don't know it.
[01:55:02.812 --> 01:55:03.512]  They don't get it.
[01:55:04.292 --> 01:55:08.793]  They join the lodge, you know, like it says in Hosea, my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.
[01:55:09.273 --> 01:55:14.415]  They join the lodge because they think it's something good to do or some guy in their church tells them to do it.
[01:55:14.935 --> 01:55:19.836]  And then once you're in, once you've got one foot in the door, it's like being in a spiritual bear trap.
[01:55:20.476 --> 01:55:22.078]  And it's very hard to get out.
[01:55:22.198 --> 01:55:24.980]  And without the grace of God, you just aren't going to get out.
[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:32.846]  Oh yeah, because what they do is they give you grand names like Master Mason and make you feel important, make you feel powerful.
[01:55:32.906 --> 01:55:35.669]  When you come out there, you feel, oh, I know stuff that other people don't.
[01:55:36.289 --> 01:55:38.291]  And you just feel proud of yourself, whatever.
[01:55:38.451 --> 01:55:40.292]  And they install that upon you.
[01:55:40.793 --> 01:55:43.335]  And they're all saying power corrupts, absolute power corrupts.
[01:55:43.895 --> 01:55:45.376]  Absolutely, and that's what they do to you.
[01:55:45.396 --> 01:55:53.662]  They give you slow, they slowly increment you and turn you from a monotheism into eventually to believe that Lucifer is God.
[01:55:53.702 --> 01:55:55.703]  I mean, like, look at the all-seeing eye, for example.
[01:55:56.043 --> 01:55:57.544]  They tell you, oh, it's the eye of God.
[01:55:57.865 --> 01:56:01.427]  Then you learn it's the eye of Horus, and eventually you learn it's Lucifer.
[01:56:01.787 --> 01:56:04.749]  You know, with the thousand points of illumination and all that stuff.
[01:56:05.350 --> 01:56:08.872]  And now, if you want to explain to people, what's the ties?
[01:56:08.932 --> 01:56:12.575]  I mean, where do the ties come from, Masonry and the Illuminati?
[01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:21.143]  Well, of course, in one way or another, the Illuminati has been around since the days of Nimrod, way back right after the Tower of Babel.
[01:56:21.883 --> 01:56:27.045]  And masonry itself claims that Nimrod is one of its greatest members.
[01:56:27.905 --> 01:56:36.649]  And the point is, is that down through the centuries, there's always been this serpentine trail, this, I call it the path of the royal secret.
[01:56:37.629 --> 01:56:43.294]  And it's this Luciferian conspiracy that's underneath the surface.
[01:56:43.354 --> 01:56:48.518]  I mean, we have a lot of Christians that contact us and say, oh, well, I don't believe in conspiracies.
[01:56:49.099 --> 01:56:51.661]  Well, the trouble with that is he reads Psalm 2.
[01:56:52.222 --> 01:56:58.367]  It talks about how the kings of the earth conspire together against Yahuwah and against his anointed.
[01:56:58.407 --> 01:57:01.569]  And, of course, the anointing is another word for Messiah or Christ.
[01:57:02.410 --> 01:57:06.413]  And so they've been conspiring for a very long time.
[01:57:07.154 --> 01:57:20.304]  And what happened in recent, and by that I mean the last 500 years or so, is that we had a group called the Society of Jesus come along, the Jesuit Order, which was founded on Illuminati principles.
[01:57:20.945 --> 01:57:27.230]  And many people don't realize that the original name of the Jesuit Order was Los Ilumbrados.
[01:57:27.930 --> 01:57:30.371]  Well, because the guy that started it was Ignatius Loyola.
[01:57:30.411 --> 01:57:35.132]  He was a Spanish soldier who supposedly got religion.
[01:57:35.852 --> 01:57:40.913]  In any way, Los Alambrados is just the Spanish word of saying the illuminated ones.
[01:57:41.793 --> 01:57:54.777]  And so, from that beginning, in the last 500 years or so, it started to grow, it started to blend, and then of course with the formation of the Mother Lodge in England, that was in 1717,
[01:57:56.977 --> 01:58:01.259]  That kind of codified what is called speculative masonry.
[01:58:01.299 --> 01:58:02.640]  That's occult masonry.
[01:58:02.660 --> 01:58:06.082]  We're not talking here about people that are laying bricks, you know.
[01:58:06.142 --> 01:58:09.143]  We're talking about people who are doing more than that.
[01:58:09.163 --> 01:58:12.805]  They're involved in Rosicrucianism, occultism.
[01:58:13.265 --> 01:58:24.431]  You know, a lot of the people who were the early speculative masons were people like, you know, Francis Bacon and Elias Ashmole and some of these other people who were very, very high-level esoteric magicians.
[01:58:25.371 --> 01:58:33.038]  And all this started coming together in 1776, which, yes, already says, oh, well, that's the year America was started.
[01:58:33.079 --> 01:58:34.700]  Well, not really.
[01:58:35.201 --> 01:58:37.703]  It was actually the year the Illuminati was started.
[01:58:38.163 --> 01:58:47.872]  On May 1st, which is a high witch holiday by the guy you mentioned earlier, Adam Weisshaupt, and he started blending masonry with Illuminism.
[01:58:48.793 --> 01:59:08.557]  And the end result is that by the time the Illuminati was officially disbanded in the latter part of the 18th century, it had thoroughly, like a virus, infected the Masonic Lodge and then also very much involved in many Protestant churches by the time of the 20th century.
[01:59:09.077 --> 01:59:14.478]  So that's how this conspiracy worked its way through the centuries very briefly.
[01:59:15.327 --> 01:59:16.847]  And, um, yeah, exactly.
[01:59:16.907 --> 01:59:18.828]  People, this is a history document.
[01:59:18.888 --> 01:59:21.288]  I mean, this is not conspiracy, because you can look this up for yourself.
[01:59:21.368 --> 01:59:23.789]  It's, uh, secrets hidden in plain sight.
[01:59:23.849 --> 01:59:24.789]  That's what it really is.
[01:59:24.829 --> 01:59:26.290]  And now, hey, you want to take some phone calls?
[01:59:26.310 --> 01:59:28.470]  Because a guy's been waiting for about an hour now.
[01:59:29.290 --> 01:59:30.050]  That'd be great.
[01:59:30.230 --> 01:59:30.891]  All right, sure.
[01:59:30.911 --> 01:59:34.031]  And, um, People's Branch from North Carolina, you're on the air.
[01:59:36.932 --> 01:59:37.132]  Hello?
[01:59:40.311 --> 01:59:41.491]  Hi People's Branch, you there?
[01:59:41.631 --> 01:59:43.052]  Thanks for having me.
[01:59:43.092 --> 01:59:44.452]  Sorry to keep you waiting for so long.
[01:59:44.492 --> 01:59:46.613]  You got a question for Mr. Schnoblem?
[01:59:48.153 --> 01:59:50.134]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:59:52.074 --> 02:00:02.897]  Could you tell me, is there any movements out there like thepeoplesbranch.org that really is after solutions?
[02:00:05.157 --> 02:00:07.059]  Oh yeah, I mean, we're about solutions here.
[02:00:07.419 --> 02:00:11.382]  Mr. Schnoblin, I mean, he's got a lot of solutions with the Illuminati and everything.
[02:00:12.363 --> 02:00:16.587]  He's got to study his books and everything else, and our books here, and Infowars.com.
[02:00:16.647 --> 02:00:19.910]  But the solution is, what he's doing now is a solution.
[02:00:19.970 --> 02:00:21.671]  Waking people up, that's a big solution.
[02:00:22.452 --> 02:00:29.358]  And what it does, when you wake up, you become aware of the stuff, and these secret societies, these people in high power, become less powerful.
[02:00:29.998 --> 02:00:31.640]  Because they're not hidden anymore.
[02:00:33.083 --> 02:00:34.243]  Yeah, and that's exactly it.
[02:00:34.283 --> 02:00:41.326]  I'm not familiar with this particular organization, but I do know there are... And this is how the church started.
[02:00:41.366 --> 02:00:44.507]  The church started as a little underground movement.
[02:00:45.348 --> 02:00:50.069]  And as it says in the Bible, you know, they ended up turning the world upside down.
[02:00:50.089 --> 02:00:55.111]  And the trouble is, in the last couple hundred years, the world has turned the church upside down.
[02:00:55.551 --> 02:00:59.773]  And we need to do some more spiritual judo on that, if you'll pardon the expression.
[02:01:00.433 --> 02:01:02.877]  And again, turn the world upside down.
[02:01:03.077 --> 02:01:11.709]  And it's done by small groups, you know, by people who are faithful, who are praying, and who, as you say, get the word out.
[02:01:11.729 --> 02:01:12.750]  Spread awareness and everything.
[02:01:12.791 --> 02:01:14.513]  And we got JR from California.
[02:01:14.533 --> 02:01:15.715]  You're on the air with Mr. Schnobel.
[02:01:18.004 --> 02:01:18.364]  How you doing?
[02:01:18.504 --> 02:01:19.705]  Sorry for waiting for so long.
[02:01:19.725 --> 02:01:21.125]  You got a question for Mr. Schnoblen?
[02:01:21.546 --> 02:01:22.006]  Yes, I do.
[02:01:22.206 --> 02:01:28.529]  I just wanted to say that I agree with him on the Tower of Babel and all of the stuff and Genesis and Psalms.
[02:01:29.269 --> 02:01:35.352]  But I wanted to know what is the easiest thing and where can we see the Illuminati in every life?
[02:01:36.572 --> 02:01:38.213]  And how can we protect ourselves from them?
[02:01:40.805 --> 02:01:45.350]  Well, basically, I mean, as you've said, they're hidden in plain sight.
[02:01:46.271 --> 02:01:50.094]  And, you know, I think many of the listeners here know about all of this.
[02:01:50.154 --> 02:01:56.160]  I mean, you know, the dollar bill, the Washington Monument, all of these things are their symbols.
[02:01:56.180 --> 02:02:00.865]  They love because, see, Lucifer is the head of the Illuminati, and he's an egomaniac.
[02:02:01.265 --> 02:02:03.207]  So he loves to sign his work.
[02:02:03.928 --> 02:02:16.374]  And that's why whenever these things happen, you know, whether they're some kind of terrorist attack or some other bizarre thing, you know, it always somehow they will find the Illuminati signature on that.
[02:02:17.154 --> 02:02:24.318]  And, you know, there's references, there's buzzwords like, you know, George Bush's famous thousand points of light reference.
[02:02:25.318 --> 02:02:28.440]  You know, and of course, Masons are always talking about light, too.
[02:02:28.480 --> 02:02:33.644]  I mean, on a day-to-day basis, look to the local Masonic lodges.
[02:02:34.224 --> 02:02:41.509]  Look to the Masonic lodges in your community, because they are like the tentacles, if you will, of the Illuminati.
[02:02:41.929 --> 02:02:48.813]  And of course, on higher levels, you have the House of the Temple in Washington, D.C., which is a very, very evil place.
[02:02:48.873 --> 02:02:49.694]  It's the headquarters
[02:02:50.334 --> 02:02:52.455]  of the American Scottish Rite.
[02:02:53.175 --> 02:03:06.160]  And all of these places are like citadels of power, because there's a cult doctrine that by building things in certain ways, and I talked about this in several of my books and videos, it's called Megapolisomancy.
[02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:11.002]  If you build, like, say, the shape of our nation's capital,
[02:03:11.562 --> 02:03:18.946]  Is actually again a phallic symbol, and it's based on the concept of a temple of Lucifer.
[02:03:19.366 --> 02:03:21.347]  Just like the Vatican, as somebody has said.
[02:03:21.367 --> 02:03:23.468]  Oh yeah, the Vatican, and Paris, France, and all that.
[02:03:23.748 --> 02:03:26.430]  And we got Tyler from Wisconsin, you're on the air.
[02:03:28.951 --> 02:03:29.751]  Hi Tyler, are you there?
[02:03:31.332 --> 02:03:31.872]  Yep, hello?
[02:03:32.173 --> 02:03:32.753]  Hey, how you doing?
[02:03:32.773 --> 02:03:34.714]  Yeah, I'm pretty good.
[02:03:34.814 --> 02:03:38.816]  I totally agree with everything he's saying.
[02:03:40.086 --> 02:03:42.108]  Oh great, and you got a question for Mr. Schnobel?
[02:03:43.570 --> 02:03:45.272]  Um, yeah, actually I do.
[02:03:45.412 --> 02:03:53.142]  I was wondering if there's anything else we can do to try to protect ourselves and try to get away from this kind of spirituality, I guess.
[02:03:54.755 --> 02:03:55.716]  Well, absolutely.
[02:03:55.776 --> 02:03:58.538]  You have to accept the Messiah.
[02:03:58.618 --> 02:04:01.019]  You have to be saved through the blood of Christ.
[02:04:01.820 --> 02:04:05.122]  That's the number one thing, because He will protect you.
[02:04:05.883 --> 02:04:09.865]  And then, listen to the voice of His Spirit, because, you know,
[02:04:10.845 --> 02:04:11.886]  He can direct things.
[02:04:11.966 --> 02:04:21.335]  I mean, right now in parts of the world where Christians are very, very heavily persecuted, they have to rely on the voice of the Holy Spirit.
[02:04:21.755 --> 02:04:26.940]  And just to even know where a meeting is, even to know, okay, where is the church service?
[02:04:27.720 --> 02:04:30.463]  Because if people knew where they were, they'd be killed.
[02:04:31.244 --> 02:04:32.865]  And this is not good.
[02:04:33.265 --> 02:04:36.748]  So we have to be open enough to the Spirit to be listening.
[02:04:37.589 --> 02:04:41.992]  And that's the critical thing, to hear His voice and then to follow.
[02:04:42.573 --> 02:04:48.477]  And then, you know, beyond that, as has been mentioned, spiritual warfare is critical.
[02:04:48.957 --> 02:05:03.367]  I mean, because you can have all the guns and all the ammunition and all this stuff, but if they come after you with spiritual darkness, with spiritual power, because that's what they're doing, all these physical weapons are not going to do you any good against the power of Satan.
[02:05:03.647 --> 02:05:04.289]  Oh, exactly.
[02:05:04.349 --> 02:05:05.251]  It's a spiritual war.
[02:05:05.271 --> 02:05:06.734]  We need to be spiritually ready.
[02:05:07.035 --> 02:05:12.067]  And we got Mike from FEMA Region 10, and this is Dan from FEMA Region 6.
[02:05:12.408 --> 02:05:12.869]  How you doing?
[02:05:13.695 --> 02:05:14.675]  I'm doing pretty good.
[02:05:14.755 --> 02:05:16.896]  Pray for you and the crew and Alex every day.
[02:05:16.956 --> 02:05:17.457]  Oh, thank you.
[02:05:17.517 --> 02:05:18.737]  We need the prayers, brother.
[02:05:18.777 --> 02:05:32.003]  Like, more important than money or anything else, we need prayers because we're the tip of the spear, basically, right into the New World Order, and they're attacking us all the time, and, you know, spiritually, everything, and probably putting curses on us as we speak.
[02:05:32.583 --> 02:05:33.984]  Ed, you got a question for Mr. Schnoblem?
[02:05:34.841 --> 02:05:36.102]  Yeah, I got two quick questions for him.
[02:05:36.142 --> 02:05:57.538]  So we know, you know, groups like CFR, Trilateral, Bilderberg, they're relatively low, you know, and then you move up, you got the Committee of 300, you know, the Knights of Garter, whatever, and the Illuminati, when I hear that, it seems like such a blanket term to me, like there's so many groups, and then, you know, there's the Black Pope, and so to him, if he can explain what is like, I mean, is it the 13 families at the top, or
[02:05:58.368 --> 02:05:59.829]  You know, who are these top groups?
[02:05:59.909 --> 02:06:09.077]  And also, if he has any interesting stories about, you know, these groups coming after him, since, you know, people like him, when you come out, usually are attacked by the Illuminati, etc.
[02:06:11.181 --> 02:06:11.821]  Well, sure.
[02:06:11.901 --> 02:06:32.294]  I mean, in my book, Masonry Beyond the Light, and in several of my DVDs, I have the, I break down the code of the pyramid that's on the back of the dollar bill, because there's a hierarchy there that's represented by, there's 13 ranks of that pyramid, which again is an interesting number, and at the near top,
[02:06:34.355 --> 02:06:41.840]  You have the Illuminati, and then at the pinnacle of the Illuminati, there is the nine unknown men.
[02:06:42.720 --> 02:06:48.344]  And this is a little different than what maybe some other people are saying, but this at least was the organization that I was involved in.
[02:06:48.444 --> 02:06:52.287]  Every continent has an unknown man over it.
[02:06:52.847 --> 02:06:55.509]  You know, North America, South America, Europe, etc.
[02:06:56.429 --> 02:06:58.771]  And there's nine of them in the world.
[02:06:59.491 --> 02:07:01.573]  And they in turn report to the seven.
[02:07:02.333 --> 02:07:07.956]  And the seven are actually, I don't know this for a fact, but I've been told they're actually fallen angelic beings.
[02:07:08.456 --> 02:07:11.958]  They're fallen angels of incredible evil power.
[02:07:12.718 --> 02:07:17.320]  And then above the seven is actually, you know, Lucifer himself.
[02:07:18.060 --> 02:07:20.021]  And of course he is a fallen cherub.
[02:07:20.061 --> 02:07:21.242]  He's not a fallen angel.
[02:07:21.322 --> 02:07:25.284]  A cherub is different than an angel, and if someone has a question about that, we can talk about that.
[02:07:27.105 --> 02:07:29.246]  But that's basically the upper part of the hierarchy.
[02:07:29.306 --> 02:07:50.080]  The lower part of the hierarchy are all these different weird occult groups like Lucha's Trust, some of the things you've mentioned, the CFR, Trilateral Commission, Bilderbergers, and of course at the lower level, you have the Freemasons, which don't know it, but they are like cannon fodder, spiritually, for the Illuminati.
[02:07:50.600 --> 02:07:55.244]  And in terms of efforts on our lives, I just tell people,
[02:07:56.605 --> 02:07:58.126]  My dad can beat up their dad.
[02:07:58.326 --> 02:07:58.906]  Hallelujah.
[02:07:59.447 --> 02:08:02.109]  And we have had, you know, like we've been shot at.
[02:08:02.189 --> 02:08:03.991]  We've had attempts on our life.
[02:08:04.071 --> 02:08:06.213]  We've tried to have people run us off the road.
[02:08:07.514 --> 02:08:09.235]  Poisonings, illnesses.
[02:08:09.395 --> 02:08:13.358]  I mean, but, you know, our God is greater.
[02:08:14.386 --> 02:08:15.246]  Absolutely.
[02:08:16.047 --> 02:08:17.147]  He is the almighty one.
[02:08:17.667 --> 02:08:22.849]  And so as long as he wants me in service down here, you know, I'm not afraid.
[02:08:23.209 --> 02:08:28.231]  I mean, you know, there's nothing they can do because, you know, you know, exactly.
[02:08:28.251 --> 02:08:28.931]  And that's how we are.
[02:08:28.971 --> 02:08:33.153]  You know, I mean, if it was so mean, like, we know our ways of being put at stake.
[02:08:33.473 --> 02:08:36.454]  Especially yours with all the stuff you know and what you've been through.
[02:08:36.794 --> 02:08:38.035]  You know, God's going to protect us.
[02:08:38.095 --> 02:08:40.175]  And the thing is, the elite hate about this.
[02:08:40.195 --> 02:08:48.498]  Because they know if God has a mission for me, for Alex Jones, for you, and for John Bowden and everybody else, if he has a mission, nobody can do anything about it.
[02:08:49.038 --> 02:08:49.418]  Nobody.
[02:08:49.458 --> 02:08:50.679]  Not even Lucifer himself.
[02:08:51.139 --> 02:08:54.020]  And we got another caller, Carlos from Illinois.
[02:08:54.040 --> 02:08:54.440]  You there?
[02:08:55.420 --> 02:08:55.980]  You there, brother?
[02:08:56.100 --> 02:08:56.801]  Yeah, how you doing?
[02:08:56.861 --> 02:08:57.561]  Awesome, how you doing?
[02:08:57.601 --> 02:08:58.401]  Thank you for calling.
[02:08:58.461 --> 02:09:00.422]  You got a question for Mr. Snowden?
[02:09:01.792 --> 02:09:10.998]  Yeah, I was wondering if you guys read that story in Drudge about, I believe it was earlier this week, about the scientist who fell asleep and ended up finding heaven through his pineal gland.
[02:09:11.018 --> 02:09:12.560]  Do you have anything to say about that?
[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:13.760]  I didn't hear nothing.
[02:09:13.940 --> 02:09:14.461]  How about you, Bill?
[02:09:15.788 --> 02:09:29.401]  No, I'm not familiar with that, but I know they're doing a lot of amazing work with the brain, and you know, people forget our brains were created by Yahuwah God, and they're created to hunger for Him.
[02:09:29.962 --> 02:09:35.007]  That's a deep need that we all have, and unfortunately a lot of people are looking in the wrong place.
[02:09:35.207 --> 02:09:36.128]  I did that for 16 years.
[02:09:37.969 --> 02:09:42.671]  16 years of my adult life looking for heaven everywhere but in the right place.
[02:09:42.731 --> 02:09:49.294]  So, you know, I mean, the pineal gland, I mean, some people call it the third eye, some people call it the Ajna Chakra.
[02:09:50.114 --> 02:09:54.756]  And, you know, the point is, our soul is bigger than that.
[02:09:55.016 --> 02:09:56.656]  Our spirit is bigger than that.
[02:09:57.117 --> 02:10:03.199]  And we don't need necessarily to activate the Ajna Chakra or whatever to become quote-unquote enlightened.
[02:10:03.899 --> 02:10:11.361]  I mean, I had the devil take his forefinger and drive it into my skull, for heaven's sakes, to be enlightened.
[02:10:12.001 --> 02:10:12.881]  And it ain't fun.
[02:10:13.522 --> 02:10:16.922]  And fortunately, Yeshua set me free from that many years ago.
[02:10:17.623 --> 02:10:22.444]  But, you know, you don't need to be messing with the brain, you need to be praying.
[02:10:23.104 --> 02:10:25.224]  And some people will take drugs, you know.
[02:10:25.264 --> 02:10:27.085]  Oh, DMT is one of them, is that correct?
[02:10:28.305 --> 02:10:35.528]  The Bible warns us about using pharmakita because it does open this third eye, you know, the penile gland that brings you into the spiritual world.
[02:10:35.548 --> 02:10:44.152]  That's why the Native Americans and everything else thought they were talking to spirits and everything, but you actually communicate into the spirit world with unclean spirits and this is scary stuff.
[02:10:44.192 --> 02:10:49.034]  And the New Age Christians, they call them, New Agers out there, think they're talking to spirits and all this stuff.
[02:10:49.054 --> 02:10:51.375]  You're not talking to spirits, you're talking to demons.
[02:10:51.915 --> 02:10:57.899]  Anything to do with hallucinations and everything, hallucinate, you know, drugs and all that, DMT especially, it's dangerous.
[02:10:57.919 --> 02:11:07.126]  The Bible warns us, don't use this pharmakita, it calls it, and this is all to do with, you know, communicating with spirits, but they're unclean spirits, like I said.
[02:11:08.626 --> 02:11:13.991]  Well, I think we need to make your listeners aware that the word in English for Pharmakaia is sorcery.
[02:11:14.472 --> 02:11:14.952]  Sorcery.
[02:11:15.313 --> 02:11:20.898]  And you can certainly see our word pharmacy, today that we use, are pharmaceutical drugs.
[02:11:21.619 --> 02:11:25.743]  That's actually what it talks about in the Book of Revelations when it says Babylon the Great.
[02:11:25.843 --> 02:11:31.168]  You guys want to pull up an image of the medical symbol with the snakes, the serpent stuff?
[02:11:32.410 --> 02:11:32.650]  Yeah.
[02:11:33.517 --> 02:11:40.659]  The Caduceus, yeah, that is, um, anyhow, Babylon the Great, it says that she deceived the world with her sorceries.
[02:11:41.520 --> 02:11:51.303]  And everybody thinks, oh, that means like magical stuff and all that, and it does, but the word there is actually pharmakeia, the word you're using, and it means, literally, it means drugs.
[02:11:52.043 --> 02:12:16.177]  And I have a couple of DVDs, like The Medical Inspiracy and Medical Murder, where I talk about how the Illuminati have pretty much gotten control of the healthcare systems, at least in the Western world, especially in America, and they're trying to push all these pharmaceutical drugs which destroy the body and destroy the mind, and it's exactly what the Book of Revelation is all about.
[02:12:16.437 --> 02:12:17.998]  And it's on screen right now, Bill.
[02:12:18.018 --> 02:12:21.780]  You want to describe that symbol of the double serpent on the staff there?
[02:12:22.581 --> 02:12:22.921]  Yeah.
[02:12:23.101 --> 02:12:25.463]  Well, it actually goes back.
[02:12:25.723 --> 02:12:28.024]  It's related to Hermes or Mercury.
[02:12:28.785 --> 02:12:37.750]  And it represents what's called the Ida and the Pingala in yoga, going up the spine to release the Kundalini.
[02:12:38.510 --> 02:12:39.831]  And this is not good.
[02:12:40.412 --> 02:12:44.094]  I mean, because it's like the serpent force, they call it in the occult.
[02:12:44.855 --> 02:12:50.762]  Well, Kundalini magic, that's what people like Joel Osteen uses in, you know, these false prophets to say, we can heal you.
[02:12:51.043 --> 02:12:58.553]  And they actually make people get off wheelchairs and walk around, dance around like retards and, you know, bark like dogs and everything.
[02:12:58.593 --> 02:13:01.356]  They think it's the spear of God, but it's Kundalini magic.
[02:13:02.017 --> 02:13:03.939]  Yeah, and exactly what Bill's just describing.
[02:13:04.020 --> 02:13:08.645]  It does, it goes up, it's energy like a coiled snake in your spine and just BAM!
[02:13:08.665 --> 02:13:12.831]  The people jump out of the wheelchair, run around barking like dogs and they think it's a miracle.
[02:13:12.971 --> 02:13:14.533]  You know, it's satanic.
[02:13:15.825 --> 02:13:17.867]  Yeah, it is very dangerous stuff.
[02:13:17.947 --> 02:13:29.635]  And unfortunately, you're right, a lot of Christian leaders and TV preachers and stuff are involved in this because they think as long as they can get results, they don't care where it comes from.
[02:13:29.836 --> 02:13:31.397]  And that's not of God.
[02:13:31.437 --> 02:13:34.659]  We're supposed to not do the things the Gentiles do.
[02:13:34.699 --> 02:13:39.323]  We're not supposed to be involved in the dark arts and things like that.
[02:13:39.363 --> 02:13:45.027]  And yet many people do it because they think it's a way to draw crowds and, of course, to get more money in the offering plate.
[02:13:47.515 --> 02:13:50.999]  And we've got one more caller here, David from California there.
[02:13:52.521 --> 02:13:52.982]  Yes I am.
[02:13:53.342 --> 02:13:54.123]  How you doing today?
[02:13:55.084 --> 02:13:56.185]  Doing alright, how are you guys doing?
[02:13:56.506 --> 02:13:56.786]  Awesome.
[02:13:56.806 --> 02:13:58.628]  How are you liking the California coast over there?
[02:13:59.890 --> 02:14:03.614]  It's great when there are night spring chem clouds all over it.
[02:14:03.754 --> 02:14:07.479]  Oh yeah, they've been bothering us the last couple of days, but you got a question for Mr. Schnoblem?
[02:14:08.494 --> 02:14:08.954]  Yes, I do.
[02:14:09.515 --> 02:14:21.600]  Actually, I was going to ask him about John Todd, and I'm sure he gets this question a lot, but I haven't really heard anything about him except that he had gotten arrested or under rape charges.
[02:14:21.660 --> 02:14:25.442]  I don't know if there's any truth to that or anything else like that.
[02:14:29.423 --> 02:14:58.051]  Yeah, and also, as far as spiritual warfare goes, I believe that God has something good for me and everything else, but I believe that also Satan has been trying to destroy me through all these various means and everything else, and he's called it everyone except for one, which is a woman, and I was wondering what I could do, even though I pray and everything else, it's just that my
[02:14:59.571 --> 02:15:04.394]  Like, my willpower is kind of weak when it comes to that, and if you have any suggestions for that.
[02:15:06.915 --> 02:15:10.137]  Well, okay, I'll try and keep both questions in mind here.
[02:15:10.157 --> 02:15:16.100]  What I would say about Mr. Todd, as I understand it, he's now deceased.
[02:15:16.140 --> 02:15:17.441]  He was murdered in prison.
[02:15:17.461 --> 02:15:20.583]  I think it was in South Carolina.
[02:15:21.303 --> 02:15:26.106]  He was accused of statutory rape and was serving time in prison.
[02:15:26.186 --> 02:15:28.027]  I heard a tape that he smuggled out.
[02:15:29.648 --> 02:15:40.132]  I don't agree with everything he taught, but I think, you know, I think basically he really did a great service to the body of Messiah because he got a lot of heat when no one else was talking about it.
[02:15:40.592 --> 02:15:42.693]  He warned about the dangers of the occult.
[02:15:43.174 --> 02:15:47.896]  He warned about the dangers of Freemasonry and Illuminati and stuff like that way back
[02:15:48.716 --> 02:15:50.337]  You know, like in the 70s.
[02:15:51.158 --> 02:15:58.524]  And, you know, unfortunately, you know, the devil was able to get at him and take him down.
[02:15:59.284 --> 02:16:02.987]  And, you know, that's, that's, you know, that sometimes happens.
[02:16:03.367 --> 02:16:09.191]  And, but no, I think the vast majority of his information was very, very valuable.
[02:16:10.272 --> 02:16:27.226]  And so, about that, in terms of your question, what we talk about in our book, Blood on the Doorpost, is that many times people become believers in Messiah, but they don't understand that they're dragging around this spiritual baggage from the past, and they need
[02:16:27.426 --> 02:16:36.411]  Hey, Mr. Schnoblin, I'm sorry, it's coming in staticky, but we're going to go to a break in about a minute, and we're going to try reconnecting with you because the audio is breaking up a little bit.
[02:16:36.891 --> 02:16:39.152]  But anyway, we'll be right back on Infowars.com.
[02:16:39.192 --> 02:16:45.836]  Again, folks, Paul, we need money to support this operation, to bring great guests like Mr. Schnoblin.
[02:16:46.176 --> 02:16:50.138]  And again, folks, the phone number, 1-877-789-ALEX.
[02:16:50.538 --> 02:16:53.340]  Call us right now, we'll put you on hold, and we'll get you in.
[02:16:54.320 --> 02:16:55.101]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:11.881 --> 02:17:12.528]  We're good.
[02:17:38.217 --> 02:17:40.658]  And look at who we found here at the water cooler.
[02:17:40.838 --> 02:17:43.318]  None other than Dan Badandi himself.
[02:17:43.718 --> 02:17:44.359]  Dan, how are you?
[02:17:44.599 --> 02:17:45.379]  Fine, how are you, Dave?
[02:17:46.339 --> 02:17:48.900]  Dan, how have you enjoyed working here so far at Infowars?
[02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:49.800]  Oh, I love it.
[02:17:49.900 --> 02:17:52.081]  I've got a great team here.
[02:17:52.101 --> 02:17:53.101]  There's awesome people.
[02:17:53.141 --> 02:17:57.202]  Yourself, Jakari, Jon Baum behind the camera, Christy holding the light.
[02:17:57.642 --> 02:17:58.702]  I mean, it's a great team.
[02:17:58.782 --> 02:17:59.863]  I love working with Alex.
[02:17:59.963 --> 02:18:00.963]  I can't say enough about it.
[02:18:01.403 --> 02:18:02.744]  What do you enjoy most about this job?
[02:18:03.545 --> 02:18:04.666]  Um, the challenge.
[02:18:04.746 --> 02:18:07.628]  I mean, we know our jobs, but every day is a different adventure.
[02:18:07.829 --> 02:18:13.774]  Because, you know, the globalists are constantly flooding us with all kinds of propaganda, flooding us with all tyranny.
[02:18:13.814 --> 02:18:16.056]  So, our job changes by the day.
[02:18:16.216 --> 02:18:19.939]  I mean, we gotta come up with new ways and better ways to fight tyranny.
[02:18:21.280 --> 02:18:25.083]  Now, a lot of people might not know, but aside from being a reporter, you do other things.
[02:18:25.123 --> 02:18:26.545]  What are some of the other things you do here at the N4?
[02:18:27.438 --> 02:18:36.625]  Well, I'm also a producer for Alex Jones Radio Show, and I was a talk show host back in Rhode Island, and hope to be one day here on Infowars.com as well.
[02:18:36.886 --> 02:18:39.007]  And I do a lot of other things behind the scenes.
[02:18:39.107 --> 02:18:43.251]  I get reports together, I do research, analysis, and many other things.
[02:18:43.311 --> 02:18:49.215]  And whenever I'm needed around the office, I help produce the Infowars Nightly News as well.
[02:18:49.936 --> 02:18:52.758]  And either if I'm not in front of the camera, I'm always behind it.
[02:18:52.878 --> 02:18:54.560]  So either way, I'm involved with something.
[02:18:55.180 --> 02:18:59.423]  Is there anything, any last thing you'd like to say to the viewers who are watching the Money Bomb right now?
[02:18:59.923 --> 02:19:03.445]  Uh, definitely we need your support because we need to grow our operation.
[02:19:03.485 --> 02:19:06.967]  And people think, oh, it's just another scam to get your money.
[02:19:07.027 --> 02:19:07.867]  No it isn't, folks.
[02:19:08.288 --> 02:19:14.251]  The money goes, as you see in the tour that Dave just gave you, the money goes to fund the operation.
[02:19:14.291 --> 02:19:19.234]  It doesn't cost little pennies to operate a foundation, you know, operation like this.
[02:19:19.594 --> 02:19:21.835]  So we need money to expand the InfoWars.
[02:19:21.855 --> 02:19:22.496]  We need money
[02:19:22.896 --> 02:19:24.357]  To reach out to folks like yourself.
[02:19:24.377 --> 02:19:26.358]  We need money to make new documentary films.
[02:19:26.719 --> 02:19:31.962]  We need money to reach out to more people on the InfoWars, Nightly News, the radio show, and so on.
[02:19:31.982 --> 02:19:33.603]  We want to expand the radio show.
[02:19:33.623 --> 02:19:35.384]  We want to expand the Nightly News.
[02:19:35.765 --> 02:19:36.665]  But we can't do that.
[02:19:36.685 --> 02:19:41.649]  I mean, it costs thousands of dollars just to send a reporter halfway across the country to cover a story.
[02:19:42.049 --> 02:19:43.790]  So the money goes to a good cause, folks.
[02:19:43.930 --> 02:19:45.531]  And I appreciate your support.
[02:19:46.152 --> 02:19:49.034]  And whatever you can donate, $5, whatever you want.
[02:19:49.054 --> 02:19:50.895]  You get a free gift and some donations.
[02:19:50.915 --> 02:19:52.516]  InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com
[02:19:53.597 --> 02:19:54.078]  Thanks Dan.
[02:19:55.219 --> 02:20:05.531]  And there up on the wall you see there's an InfoWars.com piece of wood and throughout this section here you're going to see that there's
[02:20:07.017 --> 02:20:09.178]  Other posters as well, we'll read those in a second.
[02:20:09.738 --> 02:20:15.299]  But if you come over here, you'll see that there are little designs of different characters.
[02:20:15.699 --> 02:20:23.521]  And the reason why is we're going to build, from what I'm told, a Hollywood-like studio, where we will be doing film reviews and things of that nature.
[02:20:23.601 --> 02:20:32.804]  So, we recently ordered some designs of fictitious characters, and that'll be placed up in the studio.
[02:20:34.005 --> 02:20:39.311]  This poster over here says quiet, know your place, and shut your face.
[02:20:40.212 --> 02:20:42.495]  A message from the Ministry of Homeland Security.
[02:20:42.715 --> 02:20:45.338]  Gardening victory over tyranny.
[02:21:04.868 --> 02:21:05.231]  Yeah.
[02:21:29.767 --> 02:21:33.008]  Yeah, now we're back on InfoWars.com, folks.
[02:21:33.048 --> 02:21:33.968]  The Money Bomb.
[02:21:34.068 --> 02:21:36.209]  And, folks, keep the calls coming in.
[02:21:36.269 --> 02:21:39.170]  Again, 1-877-789-ALEX.
[02:21:39.610 --> 02:21:45.612]  If you want to ask Mr. Schnobel any questions, he's going to join us, hopefully for a little while longer, because we've got a couple other topics to cover.
[02:21:46.233 --> 02:21:49.354]  And we've got Dwayne, Joey, Julius.
[02:21:50.874 --> 02:21:54.657]  Mitch and Mark and Brandon, we're going to get to your calls in just a few minutes.
[02:21:55.338 --> 02:22:02.924]  And again, you got Mr. Schnoblin, Bill Schnoblin, from withoneaccord.org, great website.
[02:22:02.964 --> 02:22:04.405]  His books are on there and everything else.
[02:22:04.525 --> 02:22:10.670]  And folks, please call in because, you know, we need money to come up with other stuff like this.
[02:22:10.730 --> 02:22:12.292]  I mean, people need to hear this stuff.
[02:22:13.052 --> 02:22:13.773]  You hear truth.
[02:22:13.853 --> 02:22:18.736]  I mean, stuff that no other radio stations would even cover or touch with a 10-foot pole.
[02:22:18.956 --> 02:22:23.620]  You'll never hear mainstream media or any going backs or any of these people covering this issue.
[02:22:24.260 --> 02:22:28.923]  There's only very few channels and radio stations that will actually touch something like this.
[02:22:30.004 --> 02:22:32.106]  And again, it's a pleasure to have you on, Mr. Schnobel.
[02:22:32.146 --> 02:22:35.189]  And I want to switch gears a little bit.
[02:22:35.249 --> 02:22:37.731]  I mean, I know we're coming upon a time of Halloween.
[02:22:38.852 --> 02:22:43.716]  If you want to give a description of the bloodbaths that took place.
[02:22:44.257 --> 02:22:47.460]  And people think Halloween is just one night, and we know it's three days.
[02:22:47.480 --> 02:22:48.841]  It's the 29th, 30th, and 31st.
[02:22:53.685 --> 02:23:03.857]  Holiday, and this is where the trick-or-treat comes from, the bobbing for apples, the jack-o'-lantern, I mean, folk, and also bonfires, which were bone fires.
[02:23:03.918 --> 02:23:07.402]  And Mr. Schnobel, what's your take, and you want to tell us the history of this?
[02:23:08.379 --> 02:23:11.800]  Well, actually it goes back even further than the Druids.
[02:23:12.220 --> 02:23:15.400]  It goes back again to the dawn of time, the Nimrod.
[02:23:16.301 --> 02:23:25.282]  And because in the Northern Hemisphere, now we're seeing the days are getting shorter, the sun appears to be going away.
[02:23:26.243 --> 02:23:34.364]  There was this idea that on this night, you know, Halloween, that the sun god was dying, quote-unquote.
[02:23:34.384 --> 02:23:37.645]  Of course, this is very scary to these primitive people.
[02:23:38.265 --> 02:23:50.610]  And the devil and his minions played on this fear, and they said, okay, because of this, you need to perform rituals, you need to do sacrifices to bring the sun god back to life.
[02:23:51.390 --> 02:24:00.274]  And so the sun god is then reborn on the next High Witch holiday, which is Yule, which is December 23rd.
[02:24:00.714 --> 02:24:05.416]  And see, that's why the whole thing got started of quote-unquote Jesus,
[02:24:05.976 --> 02:24:07.638]  Being born on December 25th.
[02:24:07.738 --> 02:24:10.221]  Actually, he was not born anywhere near that date.
[02:24:10.722 --> 02:24:11.843]  It's a pagan holiday.
[02:24:11.923 --> 02:24:13.865]  It's called Yule.
[02:24:14.786 --> 02:24:18.470]  But the point is that it's the rebirth of the sun god.
[02:24:18.550 --> 02:24:23.416]  But you need to have all these dark things being done back around the time of October 31st.
[02:24:24.577 --> 02:24:26.399]  To supposedly bring these things about.
[02:24:26.499 --> 02:24:31.904]  So in Satanism, in the Illuminati, it's a time of profound bloodletting.
[02:24:31.965 --> 02:24:36.109]  It's a time of human sacrifice and just all sorts of unspeakable things.
[02:24:36.189 --> 02:24:41.854]  And you're right, a lot of the iconography that you see around Halloween is highly occult.
[02:24:41.955 --> 02:24:45.558]  I mean, you know, black cats, witches riding on broomsticks.
[02:24:46.599 --> 02:24:52.661]  You know, the various things, you know, the jack-o-lantern, all these things are symbols of pagan deities.
[02:24:52.701 --> 02:24:57.622]  And that's why, again, as believers, we're not supposed to be a part of the world system.
[02:24:58.122 --> 02:25:05.284]  We're supposed to keep to the feasts of Yahuwah, to the feasts that are in the Bible, rather than celebrating Halloween.
[02:25:05.304 --> 02:25:14.086]  And I personally, my own story is that I was first defiled by the occult when I was a little child by being out on Halloween night.
[02:25:14.506 --> 02:25:30.010]  And I was walking around minding my own business you know with my buddy going door-to-door getting candy and all of a sudden I looked up in the sky and this is this is a beautiful October evening but I looked up in the sky and instead of being clear it was full of what I imagined were demons.
[02:25:30.310 --> 02:25:35.891]  Giant black leathery evil things with red eyes and those eyes burned into my soul.
[02:25:36.571 --> 02:25:46.922]  And from that time on, I started to have an unhealthy interest, even as a child, in things of the occult, in things involving witchcraft and the paranormal.
[02:25:47.402 --> 02:25:52.507]  And see, that was happening because back then nobody taught about the dangers of Halloween.
[02:25:52.567 --> 02:25:54.149]  My mother and father didn't know that.
[02:25:54.529 --> 02:25:55.770]  They didn't know it was dangerous.
[02:25:55.830 --> 02:25:58.073]  They thought it was part of their cultural tradition.
[02:25:58.733 --> 02:26:08.518]  But a lot of people don't understand that Halloween was illegal in America until some of my ancestors, the Irish, came over here in the 19th century and brought Halloween with them.
[02:26:08.538 --> 02:26:16.543]  But most states in the early part of American history would not allow the celebration of Halloween because they knew it was the devil's holiday.
[02:26:17.355 --> 02:26:25.203]  And now, um, you know, people need to hear the truth and, you know, we don't hold nothing back and nothing's sugar-coated because truth shouldn't be sugar-coated.
[02:26:25.543 --> 02:26:38.016]  Now, you want to get into the, uh, the gory details of, because people need to hear this, the gory details and meanings of trick-or-treat, uh, the jack-o'-lantern, uh, and all the little, uh, things on Halloween.
[02:26:38.993 --> 02:26:41.355]  Well, see, you're talking again about bail worship.
[02:26:41.536 --> 02:26:44.859]  And bail worship involves child sacrifice.
[02:26:44.879 --> 02:26:45.239]  Yes.
[02:26:45.259 --> 02:26:55.490]  And the idea of trick-or-treat went back to the time that it was expected every year that a family in a village would have to give up their child.
[02:26:56.130 --> 02:27:01.297]  To be sacrificed to Bael or to Molech or whatever the name of the deity was.
[02:27:01.337 --> 02:27:11.331]  And it's interesting, even in the British Isles, which is where a lot of people are associating Halloween with, there there is a god named Bael, B-E-L, which is just another version of Bael.
[02:27:12.512 --> 02:27:16.514]  In any event, you basically had a choice.
[02:27:16.534 --> 02:27:23.558]  The priest would come of these evil groups and they would mark the door of that house.
[02:27:23.638 --> 02:27:33.243]  In that house, you either had to turn over your youngest child to them for sacrifice or they would destroy the village.
[02:27:33.843 --> 02:27:35.584]  So that's the origin of trick-or-treat.
[02:27:35.644 --> 02:27:37.925]  Today, it's like, okay, you give us candy.
[02:27:38.725 --> 02:27:45.127]  Or we'll, like, pee pee your home, or we'll soap your windows, or, you know, ha ha ha, and it's all good fun.
[02:27:45.187 --> 02:27:46.288]  Well, no it isn't.
[02:27:46.548 --> 02:28:00.793]  And, um, Dave, you said, uh, and if you didn't give, uh, the child, the tree was, they put a hexagram, I drew one out here, I got, uh, I'm bad, I'm drawing here, but they mark a hexagram on your door, which, uh, it would invite demons
[02:28:01.793 --> 02:28:03.154]  Into the house to kill somebody.
[02:28:03.174 --> 02:28:10.978]  And the hexagram, regardless of what other people say, the hexagram is probably the most powerful talisman in all the occult.
[02:28:12.039 --> 02:28:12.759]  Is that correct, James?
[02:28:13.219 --> 02:28:13.720]  Well, yes.
[02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:18.662]  And it is definitely a symbol that attracts evil spirits.
[02:28:19.343 --> 02:28:25.626]  But I would want to clarify, because there's a lot of stuff going around about this, it's not the same thing as the Star of David.
[02:28:26.527 --> 02:28:29.248]  A hexagram has a circle around it.
[02:28:31.289 --> 02:28:35.193]  And that's what gives it, it kind of concentrates its occult power.
[02:28:35.853 --> 02:28:40.898]  I've studied many, many magical workbooks over the years, back when I was a sorcerer and a witch.
[02:28:41.719 --> 02:28:49.586]  And you'll almost never find a six-pointed star in a magical workbook unless it is inside of a circle.
[02:28:49.986 --> 02:28:54.591]  Just like you'll usually see a pentagram, which is a five-pointed star, inside of a circle.
[02:28:55.351 --> 02:29:07.537]  And so, you know, don't assume, because a lot of people will get into these anti-Semitic tirades over the fact that the symbol of Judaism is the Star of David, the Magen David.
[02:29:08.278 --> 02:29:11.439]  And that is not the same thing as a hexagram.
[02:29:11.479 --> 02:29:12.900]  But yeah, you are right.
[02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:23.005]  They would draw this on the household and then they would be smitten by demons or maybe even physically killed by the priests unless they turned over their child.
[02:29:24.486 --> 02:29:37.046]  And, uh, the jack-o'-lanterns, I mean, uh, what I learned is what they did was they took a human flesh, melted flesh, filled it up as wax to light, uh, basically as a candle, then, you know, that's the jack-o'-lantern, because you were the jack and the lantern.
[02:29:37.467 --> 02:29:37.907]  Is that correct?
[02:29:38.940 --> 02:29:39.821]  I've heard that, yeah.
[02:29:39.861 --> 02:29:45.243]  I mean, what people don't understand is that, you know, in ancient Britain, there were no pumpkins.
[02:29:45.944 --> 02:29:47.724]  I mean, pumpkins are from the New World.
[02:29:48.465 --> 02:29:56.989]  And so, actually, they would use what you're describing, or else they would also use large turnips and things like that, and they would put candles inside of them.
[02:29:57.009 --> 02:29:57.549]  Yep, that's right, yep.
[02:29:57.709 --> 02:30:06.554]  It's really, really gross things, because, again, this is all rooted in bloodletting, because the whole idea, you know, we see this in the Bible in 1 Kings 18.
[02:30:07.734 --> 02:30:19.203]  The idea that the pagan priests believe there's power in like gashing themselves and cutting themselves and shedding blood, either their own blood or more usually other people's blood.
[02:30:19.723 --> 02:30:25.227]  And there's the belief in that, that by doing that you release occult power to feed Satan.
[02:30:25.888 --> 02:30:32.933]  And of course, you know, that's not true, but yet it's a way of what I call promoting spiritual terrorism.
[02:30:33.633 --> 02:30:44.421]  Because if a community is terrified that they're going to be killed by this satanic priesthood, they're going to give over their goods and their children, whatever the devil wants.
[02:30:44.881 --> 02:30:52.186]  And we need to stop allowing that to happen, because nowadays, for example, we've industrialized this with abortion.
[02:30:52.827 --> 02:30:57.610]  We've created a huge industry of child sacrifice.
[02:30:57.670 --> 02:31:02.033]  Oh yeah, I think we had that guy, and he's a black preacher,
[02:31:03.354 --> 02:31:09.218]  His website, yeah, he had a website, basically he showed the abortions by the minute.
[02:31:10.519 --> 02:31:10.799]  Mm-hmm.
[02:31:11.960 --> 02:31:20.205]  Reverend Childress, I'm sorry, Reverend Childress, he had a website, and it's like a counter, showing the abortions by the second.
[02:31:20.666 --> 02:31:25.389]  I mean, just in the United States alone, I mean, 40,000 since May, I believe it was, 40,000 kids dead.
[02:31:27.190 --> 02:31:31.511]  Just in the United States alone, and since May of this year, and it really bothered me.
[02:31:31.531 --> 02:31:48.554]  I mean, I was up all night that night because it just really got inside me to know, as we're speaking right now, some child is being sacrificed, I call it, because they need this child's sacrifice, and that's why they dress kids in Halloween costumes like ghouls and goblins, because it's a mock sacrifice.
[02:31:49.315 --> 02:31:50.355]  Especially on Halloween.
[02:31:51.324 --> 02:31:59.326]  And the problem is, is that every one of those abortions is regarded by Satanists as a way of releasing evil energy.
[02:32:00.046 --> 02:32:03.787]  You know, it's horrible because, as you say, it's the destruction of a child.
[02:32:04.487 --> 02:32:09.568]  And many people in our nation have just kind of taken it for granted.
[02:32:09.808 --> 02:32:11.048]  Their hearts have been hardened.
[02:32:11.668 --> 02:32:16.189]  Because what does it say about a culture when they are killing their own children?
[02:32:16.229 --> 02:32:19.310]  You know, at the rate of, like you say, thousands of children a year.
[02:32:20.030 --> 02:32:21.951]  So this, this is, this is horrifying.
[02:32:22.331 --> 02:32:23.911]  Can you guys pull that up?
[02:32:24.211 --> 02:32:25.552]  That website there with the counter?
[02:32:27.892 --> 02:32:30.073]  Yeah, if you go down, this is an abortion photo.
[02:32:30.133 --> 02:32:34.434]  I don't know if it's in photos, but I don't know, probably at the, there's a counter at the bottom of the website.
[02:32:35.835 --> 02:32:42.257]  I'm sorry, Bill, I just wanted to see this, because it's just like really... There's a counter, I think, of the abortion photos.
[02:32:42.277 --> 02:32:44.217]  You go to the bottom of it, there's a counter.
[02:32:45.377 --> 02:32:46.898]  Yeah, I'm sorry, Bill, go ahead.
[02:32:48.163 --> 02:32:59.987]  Well, one other thing about Halloween, too, is that even just in, I mean, I'm like 60 years old and some, and, you know, when I was a kid, and look what happened to me, Halloween was pretty innocent.
[02:33:00.788 --> 02:33:06.230]  I mean, in the last 10 or 15 years, we've got, now we've got little kids running around dressed as Freddy Krueger.
[02:33:06.930 --> 02:33:12.893]  Or as, you know, Jason from Friday the 13th, you know, and there's all this blood and all this gore.
[02:33:12.953 --> 02:33:33.222]  I mean, I walk by the mall, you know, and I try to stay away from it, but there's this Halloween store, and they have very highly sexualized costumes for little girls, and they have very gory, evil-looking things for young kids, kids that aren't even, you know, eight or nine years old, and they're dressing them up as axe murderers and stuff like that.
[02:33:33.282 --> 02:33:36.124]  And what do you think that does to a child?
[02:33:36.644 --> 02:33:54.949]  You know, at a young age to expose them to this sort of thing, because once a child's spirit is defiled by things like this, again it goes back to spiritual warfare, that child, until, you know, the salvation of Messiah can come into their lives, that child is going to be messed up by that.
[02:33:55.669 --> 02:34:03.695]  And even some of these churches and other non-profit organizations and communities will have haunted houses.
[02:34:04.256 --> 02:34:09.179]  We have a couple of them in our community, like done by the YMCA or the Boy Scouts or whatever.
[02:34:09.860 --> 02:34:14.103]  And again, the whole point of them is to terrify kids.
[02:34:14.183 --> 02:34:15.164]  It's like a fun house.
[02:34:15.224 --> 02:34:15.885]  Ha ha ha.
[02:34:16.325 --> 02:34:22.330]  But yet what people don't realize is if you just seriously scare a child and make them shriek,
[02:34:22.990 --> 02:34:28.333]  You know, that kind of terror will open up a spiritual doorway.
[02:34:28.994 --> 02:34:34.377]  It will open up a hole in their soul that evil spirits can come in and defile.
[02:34:34.397 --> 02:34:42.982]  And when it does too, I mean, psychologically, I mean, back in the early parts of the country, you know, when the country was founded, people had a great knowledge in the Bible.
[02:34:43.082 --> 02:34:47.004]  I mean, what they're trying to do is basically take the Bible away and say, you know what,
[02:34:47.244 --> 02:34:48.605]  You need to be scared of this evil.
[02:34:48.905 --> 02:34:51.087]  And the Bible teaches us, no, don't be scared of it.
[02:34:51.368 --> 02:34:52.629]  You know, basically confront it.
[02:34:52.689 --> 02:34:53.770]  Know your enemy and expose it.
[02:34:53.790 --> 02:34:58.154]  But the way the system is today is keep your mouth shut and be afraid of it.
[02:34:58.214 --> 02:35:00.055]  You know, don't ask questions, don't do nothing.
[02:35:00.075 --> 02:35:03.298]  And, you know, that's why they condition these kids to be scared of everything.
[02:35:03.598 --> 02:35:04.679]  So they don't ask questions.
[02:35:05.340 --> 02:35:06.721]  Can I keep you for another 20 minutes?
[02:35:06.741 --> 02:35:07.141]  Do you mind?
[02:35:08.262 --> 02:35:08.883]  Absolutely.
[02:35:09.063 --> 02:35:10.624]  I'm going to take a phone call.
[02:35:10.704 --> 02:35:12.246]  Joey from Texas, you're on here.
[02:35:16.391 --> 02:35:18.092]  Sorry guys, these guys are working hard.
[02:35:18.112 --> 02:35:19.193]  They've been working all night here.
[02:35:19.213 --> 02:35:23.255]  Yeah, Joe, you there?
[02:35:23.976 --> 02:35:24.836]  Joe from Texas.
[02:35:25.877 --> 02:35:27.398]  From the Lone Star State, how you doing?
[02:35:27.418 --> 02:35:28.278]  FEMA Region 6.
[02:35:28.919 --> 02:35:29.979]  Hey, can you hear me now?
[02:35:30.179 --> 02:35:30.880]  Yep, I can hear you.
[02:35:31.140 --> 02:35:32.481]  You got a question for Mr. Schnoblem?
[02:35:33.183 --> 02:35:37.124]  Well, first of all, I wanted to say, Badonda, you're awesome for getting Bill Schnebel on.
[02:35:37.164 --> 02:35:39.005]  I can't believe it when I heard that.
[02:35:39.405 --> 02:35:47.327]  Well, the thing is, I went to the demand because I listen to the fans like we all do here, and it's hard to respond because it's just so much.
[02:35:48.087 --> 02:35:50.188]  And I heard people, we need to talk about the Illuminati.
[02:35:50.228 --> 02:35:51.408]  We need to expose them.
[02:35:51.448 --> 02:35:53.709]  We need to get to deep details about certain things.
[02:35:54.109 --> 02:35:55.009]  And I heard that, and I'm like,
[02:35:55.189 --> 02:35:58.111]  Yeah, me and my dad have been talking about this, but I was wondering, Bill, could you
[02:36:22.159 --> 02:36:48.257]  Talk more about the Magi, I believe going back before the Sumerians, and then also its relation to the mentioning of the Magi during Jesus' birth, and why it has different names and different versions of the Bible, like the Jehovah's Witness Bible and the Mormon LDS one.
[02:36:50.470 --> 02:37:03.601]  Okay, that's kind of an odd mixture, but to get to the Magi thing, the Magi were Chaldean astronomers and astrologers, and they're mentioned in the Book of Daniel.
[02:37:05.443 --> 02:37:09.606]  And Daniel was the leader of them at one point, the prophet Daniel.
[02:37:10.587 --> 02:37:16.693]  But over the centuries, like a lot of things, the two or three hundred years, some of them got corrupt.
[02:37:17.273 --> 02:37:25.720]  But the intriguing thing about this is, if you study it out, is that they were originally, they turned into priests of Zoroaster.
[02:37:26.281 --> 02:37:37.471]  And Zoroastrianism is the ancestor of the modern Farsi religion, which is basically a religion in, I think, it's Persia or Iran.
[02:37:38.071 --> 02:37:42.674]  And of course, now they're Muslims, but there's this underpinning underneath of it.
[02:37:42.694 --> 02:37:48.338]  And what happened with Daniel is, he gave all of these really specific prophecies about the coming Messiah.
[02:37:49.259 --> 02:37:51.060]  And he was very, very wealthy.
[02:37:51.620 --> 02:38:01.427]  And he, you know, because he kept getting the kings, he'd solve the king's problems, and he'd solve the king's dreams, interpret their dreams prophetically, and they'd give him all this money.
[02:38:01.807 --> 02:38:07.131]  So he had this huge amount of money, and he foretold the time of the coming of Messiah,
[02:38:07.851 --> 02:38:12.592]  And he ended up giving a legacy to these magi that were his pupils.
[02:38:13.692 --> 02:38:36.517]  That when you see a certain star coming up in a certain constellation, the constellation of Betula, which is the Hebrew way of saying Virgo, that a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son, you should take all of this wealth that I have bequeathed you and travel west to the land of Israel and give it to the king of the Jews, who will be a young child.
[02:38:37.157 --> 02:38:38.359]  And so that's what they did.
[02:38:39.100 --> 02:38:51.434]  So, you know, in a sense, the Magi were actually serving the purposes of the Almighty, even though they were not actually aware of it at the time.
[02:38:51.994 --> 02:38:58.659]  But yet they ended up actually getting saved because they followed the star and we all know the story.
[02:38:59.140 --> 02:39:01.121]  But there's a lot more to the story.
[02:39:01.421 --> 02:39:03.143]  So that's the deal about the Magi.
[02:39:04.084 --> 02:39:11.429]  Now in terms of the Bible versions, we very much strongly insist on the King James Bible.
[02:39:12.870 --> 02:39:19.836]  The counterfeit Bibles are everywhere and of course the Jehovah Witness Bible is one of the worst, you know, out there.
[02:39:20.616 --> 02:39:31.966]  And at the same time, though, I mean, what people don't know is that many of the modern Bibles that are used by Christians, like the New American Standard Bible, the NIV Bible, are based on the same text as the Jehovah Witness Bible.
[02:39:32.687 --> 02:39:48.200]  You know, and that's a whole discussion in itself, which we probably don't have time to get into, but I just, especially if you're doing spiritual warfare, because all the other modern Bibles will attack the deity of Christ, they will remove references to the blood of Christ,
[02:39:48.880 --> 02:39:55.723]  They will, you know, do other things to denigrate Bible truth like, for example... Oh yeah, well look at the NIV, for example.
[02:39:55.763 --> 02:39:57.424]  That's a New World Order Bible right there.
[02:39:57.444 --> 02:39:58.525]  That thing's disgusting.
[02:39:58.585 --> 02:40:00.806]  I mean, you should burn that Bible if you have one.
[02:40:01.446 --> 02:40:02.546]  And we've got to move on.
[02:40:02.607 --> 02:40:04.507]  And thank you, Joey, from Texas.
[02:40:04.788 --> 02:40:05.648]  Great hearing from you.
[02:40:06.088 --> 02:40:08.109]  And we're going to go to Julius from Georgia.
[02:40:08.129 --> 02:40:09.130]  Your honor, how are you doing?
[02:40:10.110 --> 02:40:10.770]  Great, Mr. Bradotti.
[02:40:10.790 --> 02:40:11.110]  How are you?
[02:40:11.311 --> 02:40:11.931]  Fine, how are you?
[02:40:12.131 --> 02:40:14.092]  And how are you liking the money bomb so far?
[02:40:14.112 --> 02:40:15.753]  Oh, I think it's great, man.
[02:40:17.062 --> 02:40:37.820]  Here's the thing, you guys see things in terms of sort of a binary opposite, good and evil, God versus Satan, and here's the really funny thing, man, I'm a neo-pagan, I follow the Germanic path, and if I had a choice between the secular world where, like, the church is denied and God is thrown out of all the schools and all this kind of stuff, I would reject that in favor of Christianity.
[02:40:38.460 --> 02:40:44.866]  So, I favor gun rights, I'm against abortion, I, like, stand for everything you guys say, but then when you're just saying, like,
[02:40:45.959 --> 02:40:50.683]  It just feels like there's a lot of judgment and a lot of hate, and it's rough, dude.
[02:40:50.783 --> 02:40:53.064]  There's two kinds of Christians out there, okay?
[02:40:53.324 --> 02:41:03.232]  There's a very rare Christian, which is a true Bible-believing Christian that doesn't follow religion, that doesn't go to these 501c3 churches, because the mainstream churches out there...
[02:41:03.772 --> 02:41:04.813]  They promote that.
[02:41:04.913 --> 02:41:06.615]  We're better than anybody else.
[02:41:06.675 --> 02:41:12.520]  We don't have to worry about nothing because we're going to be magically beamed up by Scotty before all the bad stuff happens.
[02:41:12.841 --> 02:41:14.923]  And that's what these churches teach.
[02:41:15.363 --> 02:41:18.126]  And again, there's two kinds of Christians out there.
[02:41:18.786 --> 02:41:21.489]  A real Christian doesn't belong to a religion.
[02:41:21.569 --> 02:41:23.711]  A real Christian knows the Bible on its own.
[02:41:23.731 --> 02:41:24.892]  They don't judge anybody.
[02:41:24.912 --> 02:41:27.735]  I mean, you look at it, we've got Catholics and Christians out there.
[02:41:28.255 --> 02:41:29.976]  He's yelling and swearing at gay people.
[02:41:30.156 --> 02:41:35.400]  You gotta go to hell instead of nicely talking to them or people who support abortion.
[02:41:35.780 --> 02:41:36.601]  You gotta go to hell.
[02:41:37.061 --> 02:41:38.662]  You don't do that.
[02:41:38.722 --> 02:41:44.506]  Them being gay, if you swear, it's just the same amount of sin as that person being gay.
[02:41:45.646 --> 02:41:46.627]  They don't realize this stuff.
[02:41:46.647 --> 02:41:47.628]  There's no degree in sin.
[02:41:48.547 --> 02:41:51.511]  And everybody, all of us, myself, I sin all day, you know, every day.
[02:41:51.531 --> 02:42:03.406]  And, you know, I mean, the thing is repentance, but I mean, like, if you really want to do, I'm not trying to throw the Bible down your throat, brother, but if you really want to know the real God, the real Yeshua Messiah, okay?
[02:42:04.267 --> 02:42:05.788]  Study the Bible on your own.
[02:42:05.868 --> 02:42:15.033]  Don't listen to these half-bred priests from the Vatican or these false prophets like the 700 Club, Billy Graham, Pat Robinson.
[02:42:15.274 --> 02:42:16.855]  These guys are evil, bottom line.
[02:42:17.135 --> 02:42:20.657]  And I don't have time to discuss all that, but I mean, these people are evil.
[02:42:20.717 --> 02:42:23.318]  If you want to get to know God, whatever, do it on your own.
[02:42:23.639 --> 02:42:25.820]  And ask for guidance as well.
[02:42:26.360 --> 02:42:27.501]  And you got any comments on that, Bill?
[02:42:28.444 --> 02:42:37.109]  Well, yeah, I would pretty much agree, and I would just say that, you know, realize that the true message of Yeshua, of Jesus, is not ever hate.
[02:42:38.450 --> 02:42:45.734]  You know, I was a pagan for 16 years, and, you know, no Christian ever witnessed to me.
[02:42:46.554 --> 02:42:55.640]  Nobody ever tried to tell me about the Lord, and I wish they had, because I never knew how empty I was until I asked Him into my heart.
[02:42:56.321 --> 02:43:02.425]  And you're right, it's not about hate, and it's not about going to some building or some religion.
[02:43:02.785 --> 02:43:05.867]  It's about a relationship with the Creator of the universe.
[02:43:06.207 --> 02:43:06.667]  Absolutely.
[02:43:06.687 --> 02:43:14.832]  When God talks about the church, he's not talking about a building, he's not talking about the structure, or this priest with this million dollar necklace or whatever.
[02:43:15.072 --> 02:43:16.993]  He's talking about a church is you.
[02:43:17.614 --> 02:43:20.475]  You're the church, the physical body, the flesh is the temple of the church.
[02:43:20.935 --> 02:43:25.098]  Just me and Bill here, we make up the church here because we're talking.
[02:43:25.338 --> 02:43:27.859]  When two or more gather in his name, that's the church.
[02:43:27.919 --> 02:43:30.741]  It could be in your basement, in your car, anywhere.
[02:43:31.101 --> 02:43:32.482]  But the religions will never teach you that.
[02:43:32.502 --> 02:43:34.083]  They'll tell you, you have to come here,
[02:43:34.363 --> 02:43:41.089]  You gotta pay us, uh, they'll bring up that Bible verse, like, 10% of your tithes to the church, but they don't bring up the other verse, how it was abolished later.
[02:43:41.610 --> 02:43:48.917]  They'll throw that at ya, and, you know, to make you... The thing is about religions, uh, even Jesus in the book of Thomas said about, uh, organized religion.
[02:43:49.457 --> 02:43:54.259]  And when he says, uh, money's the root of all evil, he was talking about the first corporations were the churches.
[02:43:54.719 --> 02:43:56.239]  The religion's out there to scare you.
[02:43:56.259 --> 02:43:59.220]  You gotta go to hell if you don't come here, go to confession, blah, blah, blah.
[02:43:59.440 --> 02:44:02.341]  When the book of Matthew debunks the whole catechism on its own.
[02:44:02.961 --> 02:44:05.702]  And I'm not picking on just Catholics, but all religions are the same.
[02:44:05.842 --> 02:44:07.483]  They got the equal evilness.
[02:44:07.763 --> 02:44:09.923]  They've been infiltrated, especially by the Illuminati.
[02:44:10.323 --> 02:44:11.824]  I mean, I could go on all night with this stuff.
[02:44:11.884 --> 02:44:14.525]  And, um, we got, uh, Brandon from Kentucky.
[02:44:14.545 --> 02:44:14.945]  How you doing?
[02:44:16.004 --> 02:44:17.265]  I'm doing great, and how about yourself?
[02:44:17.525 --> 02:44:18.586]  Oh, not bad.
[02:44:18.606 --> 02:44:20.827]  Staying up late here, supporting the money bomb here.
[02:44:21.167 --> 02:44:21.708]  It's awesome.
[02:44:21.728 --> 02:44:22.768]  Oh, yeah.
[02:44:23.189 --> 02:44:27.331]  And we got one guy, John Bowne, he's from Kentucky there, too.
[02:44:27.852 --> 02:44:30.273]  But anyway, you got a question for Mr. Shulman?
[02:44:30.794 --> 02:44:33.475]  Yeah, actually I had two short questions.
[02:44:33.956 --> 02:44:41.501]  One was, what is his take on the book of Eddadorphia?
[02:44:41.641 --> 02:44:43.202]  It's a Freemasonry book.
[02:44:45.137 --> 02:44:49.759]  If there is any dangers in owning that book and Look to the East.
[02:44:50.739 --> 02:45:10.148]  Also, what is his take on all these end time events that are going on that would seem apocalyptic and I'm wondering if he thinks that it's the Illuminati manipulating the things of the Bible or the Bible is actually coming true.
[02:45:10.249 --> 02:45:13.050]  So that would be my questions and thank you guys for your time.
[02:45:15.698 --> 02:45:23.562]  I must confess, I've never heard of this book of Eddadorphia, but if it's a Masonic book, I really don't advise having it in your house.
[02:45:24.783 --> 02:45:27.084]  You know, it depends on why you have it.
[02:45:27.244 --> 02:45:37.368]  I mean, at one time I had a lot of these kind of weird books, and even now, I've prayed over them, I've pled the blood of Yeshua over them, and I keep them somewhere else.
[02:45:37.388 --> 02:45:38.789]  I don't keep them in my home.
[02:45:39.449 --> 02:45:56.395]  So, even though I'm a minister of the gospel and I have them for holy reasons, I really don't recommend it unless you're a minister or unless you're really very spiritually mature, because they can really draw malignant influences into your home, especially if you happen to have children.
[02:45:58.776 --> 02:46:00.857]  I'm sorry, I forgot the other half of the question.
[02:46:02.540 --> 02:46:03.301]  You still there, Brandon?
[02:46:03.821 --> 02:46:05.282]  Yeah, I'm still here.
[02:46:05.362 --> 02:46:18.894]  The other half of the question, well, I actually mentioned another book was Look to the East, and the point on the books were, I've heard that people have been killed over having the books, actually owning the books in print.
[02:46:19.654 --> 02:46:24.538]  And the other question was, do you believe that
[02:46:25.689 --> 02:46:30.430]  There's Illuminati actually manipulating these end-time events.
[02:46:30.570 --> 02:46:33.271]  I mean, the things that are happening on a daily basis.
[02:46:34.011 --> 02:46:38.172]  I mean, through, say, weather technology, these sort of things.
[02:46:39.212 --> 02:46:44.694]  Or do you actually believe that the Bible events are happening as they are said?
[02:46:46.295 --> 02:46:55.355]  Well, in the first day I know there are certain books that are so dangerous that just having them in your home, people have died.
[02:46:56.144 --> 02:47:00.866]  You know, killed by being driven mad, being driven insane as their children were.
[02:47:01.627 --> 02:47:06.089]  I don't know about these two books, but if they're Masonic, as I said, I'd burn them.
[02:47:06.149 --> 02:47:06.849]  I'd get rid of them.
[02:47:07.450 --> 02:47:18.075]  In terms of the other thing, you need to realize that sometimes we see this in the Bible, that the Almighty will use pagan kings to do His bidding.
[02:47:18.815 --> 02:47:32.167]  He will use people that are evil to bring enough judgment into a society, like Israel in the case of the Old Testament, to try and bring them to repentance.
[02:47:35.089 --> 02:47:43.174]  I did a whole talk on weather warfare and scalar technology that was called Russia's secret weapon to destroy America many years ago.
[02:47:43.674 --> 02:47:50.018]  I know that they have the power to create hurricanes, to create storms, to create earthquakes, all of these things.
[02:47:50.058 --> 02:47:50.779]  That's out there.
[02:47:50.819 --> 02:47:53.100]  I mean, the documentation is there.
[02:47:53.781 --> 02:47:58.504]  But whether or not they're doing it to mimic the Bible or whether it's being done
[02:47:59.324 --> 02:48:01.144]  By the Almighty?
[02:48:01.864 --> 02:48:02.985]  That I don't know for sure.
[02:48:03.045 --> 02:48:12.206]  I do know that they often, by they I mean the Illuminati, will use weather technology to create disasters to try and just create more chaos.
[02:48:12.246 --> 02:48:21.468]  Because they believe the more chaos they create, the more likely it is that they can move in with their wonderful plan to, you know, save the world, quote unquote.
[02:48:22.548 --> 02:48:24.709]  And we got Mitch from Wisconsin.
[02:48:24.749 --> 02:48:25.249]  How you doing?
[02:48:25.289 --> 02:48:26.989]  You're on here at InfoWars.com.
[02:48:28.379 --> 02:48:28.559]  Hello?
[02:48:28.899 --> 02:48:29.499]  Hi Mitch, you there?
[02:48:30.460 --> 02:48:31.320]  Yeah, can you hear me?
[02:48:31.640 --> 02:48:33.881]  Yep, I can hear you loud and clear from FEMA Region 6.
[02:48:33.921 --> 02:48:34.601]  How are you doing?
[02:48:35.982 --> 02:48:36.482]  Oh, man.
[02:48:37.482 --> 02:48:38.303]  Well, I'm doing good.
[02:48:38.323 --> 02:48:39.683]  How are you guys doing?
[02:48:39.803 --> 02:48:40.123]  Oh, great.
[02:48:40.143 --> 02:48:42.004]  How are you liking the money bomb so far?
[02:48:42.024 --> 02:48:42.764]  48 hours, man.
[02:48:43.164 --> 02:48:44.505]  We're pushing it.
[02:48:45.485 --> 02:48:46.025]  I'm loving it.
[02:48:46.046 --> 02:48:47.646]  This is actually my first year.
[02:48:48.266 --> 02:48:49.267]  Oh, great.
[02:48:49.287 --> 02:48:53.268]  I'm glad you're staying up for this because we're touching on some very important issues.
[02:48:53.368 --> 02:48:55.229]  Do you have a question for Mr. Schnobel?
[02:48:56.801 --> 02:49:04.248]  Yeah, I kind of do because I did have a question and he touched up on it while I was listening.
[02:49:06.630 --> 02:49:12.996]  Researching all the Illuminati stuff and all their practicing and magic and rituals and whatnot.
[02:49:15.174 --> 02:49:19.598]  Just other information that I've came across, you know, doing research.
[02:49:20.398 --> 02:49:28.605]  I just kind of wanted to know, like, how much are they into doing psychedelics during rituals, during practicing magic?
[02:49:30.441 --> 02:49:39.550]  Well, I know when I was involved with these things, it was primarily using a very powerful form of hashish, which can be psychedelic.
[02:49:40.932 --> 02:49:47.158]  And using that, and to a lesser extent, using things like peyote and mescaline and ayahuasca.
[02:49:47.579 --> 02:49:52.684]  So yeah, this is done because it's believed in the occult of these things, open up your third eye.
[02:49:53.204 --> 02:49:54.785]  And they're very, very dangerous.
[02:49:55.306 --> 02:50:08.235]  You know, you don't want to blow open your third eye because, I mean, you know, what it really does is it invites in what the Bible calls a spirit of divination.
[02:50:08.656 --> 02:50:09.476]  And that's a demon.
[02:50:10.017 --> 02:50:17.062]  And once that demon strongman gets into you, you may acquire occult power, which of course is what the Illuminati want.
[02:50:17.102 --> 02:50:18.543]  They want to have occult power.
[02:50:19.123 --> 02:50:21.865]  But I'm talking about the average person, especially a Christian.
[02:50:21.905 --> 02:50:39.536]  You do not want to be taking those kind of chemicals because it will totally blow away your mind and, you know, I mean, even from this, because I've had courses on a graduate level in psychopharmacology, what these things do is they mimic psychosis.
[02:50:40.296 --> 02:50:42.897]  In other words, they make you temporarily schizophrenic.
[02:50:43.517 --> 02:50:45.078]  And that's not a good place to be.
[02:50:45.598 --> 02:50:55.943]  And when you add the demonic component, that's why when you hear of young people or even not so young people taking these drugs, and I've taken all of them in my evil past,
[02:50:57.404 --> 02:51:04.330]  You really end up with a bucket load of demons in your lap and it's a horrible experience to try and get out of.
[02:51:04.350 --> 02:51:10.076]  That's why many people who get bound up in drugs end up trying to commit suicide and stuff like that.
[02:51:10.136 --> 02:51:11.457]  It's just a horrible thing.
[02:51:13.178 --> 02:51:16.922]  Any other questions before we move to our last caller?
[02:51:17.923 --> 02:51:21.927]  No, just want to comment on his answer.
[02:51:22.871 --> 02:51:43.364]  I do agree how the average person could easily have very bad results if they indulge in psychedelics, but touching on what you said, what the Bible refers to it as, hasn't there been positive experiences that people have told?
[02:51:44.514 --> 02:51:55.728]  And, uh, I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure someone did research into, like, the Dead Sea Scrolls and said that the entire religion might be a misinterpretation of a mushroom cult.
[02:51:55.808 --> 02:51:56.469]  Have you ever heard that?
[02:51:57.834 --> 02:52:00.036]  Yeah, that's the work of John Allegro.
[02:52:00.196 --> 02:52:04.238]  I think it's kind of, with all due respect, I think it's pretty much nonsense.
[02:52:04.779 --> 02:52:10.963]  He talks about magic mushrooms and how that's really, you know, what actually Yeshua was a mushroom.
[02:52:12.004 --> 02:52:23.051]  And I mean, obviously you can believe what you want, but I really don't think that I've heard of anybody having a real positive spiritual experience with psychedelics.
[02:52:23.371 --> 02:52:24.112]  Oh, absolutely not.
[02:52:24.132 --> 02:52:25.973]  I mean, it leads to destruction.
[02:52:26.033 --> 02:52:29.155]  I mean, anything to do with drugs at all like that.
[02:52:29.555 --> 02:52:39.021]  I mean, the thing is, you're supposed to be in your conscious state of mind, and to be subconscious and out to La La Land or whatever, you're walking a dangerous path right there.
[02:52:39.041 --> 02:52:44.705]  And we're going to go to our last caller, then we're going to have Bill Schnoble, and he's going to have the floor for the last five minutes.
[02:52:45.165 --> 02:52:47.627]  And we've got Mark from Oregon, you're on the air, how you doing?
[02:52:48.689 --> 02:52:52.771]  Hey, I'm doing okay, Dan, and greetings to you and Bill.
[02:52:53.172 --> 02:52:53.612]  Oh, thank you.
[02:52:54.152 --> 02:52:55.813]  And I'm glad you're staying up late for this.
[02:52:55.893 --> 02:52:58.635]  I mean, we're doing the graveyard shift over here, pushing into overdrive.
[02:52:59.255 --> 02:53:02.617]  Oh, I've caught about at least 90% of the money, Bob, today.
[02:53:02.717 --> 02:53:03.098]  Oh, great.
[02:53:03.158 --> 02:53:04.839]  It's been a real special thing.
[02:53:05.119 --> 02:53:05.839]  It really has.
[02:53:06.119 --> 02:53:07.140]  This is our WrestleMania.
[02:53:07.160 --> 02:53:08.461]  This is our Super Bowl, you know what I mean?
[02:53:08.481 --> 02:53:13.624]  Because it's a time of year we all get to come together and say, yeah, we got to put out good product for the people.
[02:53:14.124 --> 02:53:16.946]  And that's what you're funding, because the more
[02:53:17.506 --> 02:53:22.109]  You know, the more people give, the more we can expand our operation to provide shows like this.
[02:53:22.209 --> 02:53:24.871]  Alex has been talking about expanding the radio show.
[02:53:24.911 --> 02:53:26.291]  My dream is to do a night show.
[02:53:26.311 --> 02:53:31.114]  I would love to do a show like this at least once a week for now.
[02:53:31.154 --> 02:53:33.216]  We need the money to do something like this.
[02:53:33.856 --> 02:53:39.559]  And to bring people like Bill on, which I greatly appreciate because he's staying up late for this.
[02:53:39.780 --> 02:53:41.541]  But anyway, you got a question?
[02:53:41.961 --> 02:53:45.143]  Yeah, the sun will be coming up before too long, where y'all are at.
[02:53:47.967 --> 02:53:48.928]  It's past late.
[02:53:49.688 --> 02:53:54.453]  Yeah, that's why they call it the graveyard because everybody's a walking dead zombie right now.
[02:53:54.533 --> 02:53:57.155]  I look at it as the park on a beautiful Sunday morning.
[02:53:57.855 --> 02:54:06.002]  The quality of the light kind of gets sublimated beneath the gravity of the truth of the conversation.
[02:54:09.580 --> 02:54:21.985]  Bill, I think it was a four cassette tape set, it was a few years before CDs, back in the mid-nineties, that you had made through the Prophecy Club.
[02:54:22.706 --> 02:54:28.308]  And I can't remember the name of the... Did they expose an Illuminati from within?
[02:54:28.348 --> 02:54:28.968]  I think so.
[02:54:29.649 --> 02:54:32.230]  I think you hit it right on the head, Dan.
[02:54:32.670 --> 02:54:35.371]  And I was very impressed there.
[02:54:36.231 --> 02:54:37.232]  I thought that you had
[02:54:40.146 --> 02:54:54.616]  A Christian witness of the persuasion to non-believers and of the spiritual strength is an underlay and overlay coming out of your vast experience on the occult.
[02:54:56.418 --> 02:54:57.679]  And I was very impressed with you.
[02:54:57.699 --> 02:55:06.105]  And about six or seven years ago, Bill, I suggested to Alex on a call in that he have you on as a guest, but he really hadn't heard much of you.
[02:55:07.220 --> 02:55:23.969]  And I'm so glad that Dan brought you on tonight, Bill, because I think you have, it's not alone, but it is unique in some very ways that stand out strongly, say comparatively, with Doc Marquis.
[02:55:24.802 --> 02:55:25.823]  He's also very good.
[02:55:25.863 --> 02:55:31.970]  He tends to be more intellectual, which is fine, because we all have different qualities, which the Lord uses.
[02:55:32.470 --> 02:55:35.573]  But you bring your heart to it in a very big way, Bill.
[02:55:35.854 --> 02:55:43.442]  And it'd be a great idea, Dan, it's just a suggestion, if you could have Alex to bring Bill on, and perhaps Doc Marques, because
[02:55:44.042 --> 02:55:45.783]  I would love to bring him on.
[02:55:46.264 --> 02:55:48.885]  Actually, I would love to have both of these guys on at once.
[02:55:48.986 --> 02:55:52.208]  I mean, if I ever get the opportunity again, I would love to have both of them on.
[02:55:52.628 --> 02:55:59.073]  Because, I mean, you know, there's a lot of people out there who write books about the Illuminati or whatever, but these two people, they're the real deal.
[02:55:59.813 --> 02:56:02.335]  I mean, they've been there, they've done that, you know what I mean?
[02:56:02.455 --> 02:56:06.118]  That's why I don't look to other people for, you know, when I do research and all that.
[02:56:06.198 --> 02:56:15.425]  I, you know, research under Bill Schnoble and Mark, you know what I mean, and Fritz Springmeier and Cisco Wheeler and all these people who've been there and done that.
[02:56:16.126 --> 02:56:18.608]  And, yeah, I mean, these guys are great, a lot of information.
[02:56:18.668 --> 02:56:22.411]  And, you know, I'll just say, wow, because, Bill, I mean, like, we could be here all night.
[02:56:22.431 --> 02:56:27.155]  We didn't even cover half the subjects we wanted to talk about with Mitt Romney and everything else.
[02:56:27.215 --> 02:56:28.576]  And, Mark, you got any other questions?
[02:56:31.171 --> 02:56:40.720]  I wanted to ask you what your views are on Mitt Romney relative to Joseph Smith's White Horse Prophecy, which I would imagine you're probably familiar with, at least generally.
[02:56:41.520 --> 02:56:43.282]  Oh, I'm familiar with it specifically.
[02:56:44.263 --> 02:56:44.743]  Yeah.
[02:56:44.803 --> 02:56:52.130]  Well, if there was ever a time the country seems to be losing its constitution, it would seem to be now, and he happens to be a high Mormon and running, so...
[02:56:56.107 --> 02:57:04.775]  We have gotten a couple of DVDs out there, including this Throne of Fools, where I talk about Mitt Romney versus Obama.
[02:57:05.375 --> 02:57:09.158]  And, of course, now that we're getting down to the wire, I think it's very important information.
[02:57:09.178 --> 02:57:13.182]  And I do warn people that he's a high priest.
[02:57:13.482 --> 02:57:15.304]  Romney is in the LDS Church.
[02:57:15.804 --> 02:57:19.087]  He's part of a fifth-generation Mormon dynasty.
[02:57:19.487 --> 02:57:21.329]  He's not just a Mormon.
[02:57:21.389 --> 02:57:23.210]  He's a very high-level Mormon.
[02:57:24.091 --> 02:57:41.557]  And they have their own view, which you alluded to in the White Horse Prophecy, that one day an elder of Israel will save America, will save the Constitution, and then will start a benevolent dictatorship that they call the United Order.
[02:57:42.478 --> 02:57:49.446]  And it will basically be a communistic society that's run by the prophet, seer, and revelator of the Mormon Church.
[02:57:50.167 --> 02:57:58.296]  And I mean, I don't have time to get into the whole thing, but I really, as dangerous as Obama is, Romney in his own
[02:57:58.376 --> 02:57:59.197]  Bill, I hate to cut you off.
[02:57:59.277 --> 02:58:00.017]  I'm sorry.
[02:58:00.358 --> 02:58:02.459]  We've got about 30 seconds left.
[02:58:02.800 --> 02:58:03.881]  Your final take.
[02:58:03.941 --> 02:58:06.883]  Your website once again, withoneaccord.org.
[02:58:06.903 --> 02:58:09.765]  I appreciate so much you coming on this late.
[02:58:10.186 --> 02:58:11.026]  It's been a pleasure.
[02:58:11.046 --> 02:58:13.989]  Stay right there after the show because I want to talk to you during the break.
[02:58:14.049 --> 02:58:17.732]  If you want to promote your website, you've got 10 seconds.
[02:58:18.392 --> 02:58:21.475]  Yeah, www.withoneaccord.org.
[02:58:21.926 --> 02:58:23.488]  And also, you can catch him on YouTube.
[02:58:23.548 --> 02:58:25.549]  He has great documentaries, folks.
[02:58:26.490 --> 02:58:28.332]  Exposing the Illuminati from within.
[02:58:28.372 --> 02:58:29.173]  He's got other ones.
[02:58:29.233 --> 02:58:31.015]  And again, with oneaccord.org.
[02:58:31.075 --> 02:58:34.178]  And when we come back, we're going to open the phone lines 1-877-789-ALEX.
[02:58:34.378 --> 02:58:38.822]  And we're going to have a special guest host, Rich Anatone.
[02:58:38.842 --> 02:58:41.084]  And we'll be right back on InfoWars.com.
[02:58:41.685 --> 02:58:42.365]  Money Bomb!
[02:58:42.385 --> 02:58:42.686]  Yeah!
[02:58:44.949 --> 02:58:46.851]  It's the InfoWars Money Bomb 2012.
[02:58:47.912 --> 02:58:50.434]  October 18th and 19th.
[02:58:50.454 --> 02:58:51.835]  48 hour special transmission.
[02:58:52.276 --> 02:58:54.858]  The tyrants need to know we're coming for them.
[02:58:55.159 --> 02:58:56.960]  And the InfoWars is expanding.
[02:58:57.200 --> 02:59:00.544]  And the people of America and the world are awakening and behind us!
[02:59:02.284 --> 02:59:10.567]  While the global scientific dictatorship is busy injecting toxins into our water supply to dumb us down, we're busy injecting reality into society.
[02:59:11.148 --> 02:59:13.529]  It's the beginning of the end for the New World Order.
[02:59:14.049 --> 02:59:16.270]  Donate at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com
[02:59:25.222 --> 02:59:27.143]  The Illuminati does exist.
[02:59:27.784 --> 02:59:34.248]  The secret society is so notorious that many have assumed it resides only in legend and myth.
[02:59:35.029 --> 02:59:41.113]  But it was in fact founded on May 1st, 1776 in the heart of Bavaria, Germany.
[02:59:41.133 --> 02:59:44.675]  Aaron Dykes here for InfoWars.com in Bavaria, Germany.
[02:59:45.094 --> 02:59:52.681]  We're in Ingolstadt, in 1776, Professor Adam Weishaupt founded the Illuminati, right here at this university.
[02:59:53.261 --> 02:59:59.387]  And we are, as a people, opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths, and to secret proceedings.
[03:00:00.087 --> 03:00:08.475]  But we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on infiltration instead of invasion.
[03:00:09.420 --> 03:00:11.102]  On subversion instead of election.
[03:00:11.302 --> 03:00:14.825]  We'd like to show the historic background of the original Illuminati.
[03:00:15.026 --> 03:00:27.338]  It was here in Ingolstadt 1776 when Adam Weishaupt founded the original Bavarian Illuminati, a secret order he founded here around the University of Ingolstadt.
[03:00:27.678 --> 03:00:30.099]  The original documents of the Illuminati are preserved at the State Museum.
[03:01:03.150 --> 03:01:10.212]  Adam Weishaupt's role in forming the Illuminati inside the city of Ingolstadt in Bavaria, Germany cannot be disputed.
[03:01:10.352 --> 03:01:13.594]  We're overlooking a model of the old city of Ingolstadt.
[03:01:13.654 --> 03:01:22.457]  Professor Adam Weishaupt wanted to use his secret society to overthrow existing religions and all existing governments, especially monarchies.
[03:01:23.109 --> 03:01:39.181]  Instead, he wanted the learned men of universities using the pagan values of the old system passed down from societies like Egypt and Babylon to rule the world instead of the oppressive religious regimes and the oppressive monarchies that were in existence in Europe at the time.
[03:01:39.241 --> 03:01:45.866]  It was not through armies and force and numbers that Adam Weishaupt hoped to take over the existing government to change them.
[03:01:46.406 --> 03:01:52.050]  Instead, he used his Illuminati secret society to infiltrate the existing structures of government
[03:01:52.315 --> 03:01:52.916]  We're good to go.
[03:02:01.129 --> 03:02:13.697]  Behind the scenes, powerful people like Mayor Amshel Rothschild were involved in founding the Bavarian Illuminati, while important titled and lettered men composed its membership.
[03:02:14.417 --> 03:02:18.580]  It claimed to work in secret only because it couldn't work out in the open.
[03:02:18.960 --> 03:02:27.285]  The Bavarian Illuminati used Freemasonry and other competing secret society lodges as an engine to conceal its inner membership.
[03:02:27.785 --> 03:02:31.107]  and project its agenda into already powerful circles.
[03:02:32.008 --> 03:02:40.793]  Degrees of the Illuminati structure were adopted into many Masonic traditions, creating an effective venue for recruitment and control.
[03:02:41.513 --> 03:02:48.658]  Weishaupt himself took over key lodges in neighboring Munich and other parts of Bavaria, making the Lodge St.
[03:02:48.718 --> 03:02:51.840]  Theodore the de facto headquarters of the Illuminati.
[03:02:52.520 --> 03:02:57.223]  From that point, membership swelled and the group's allies spread across Europe.
[03:02:57.876 --> 03:03:04.820]  I'm standing in the old city of Munich, not far from where Adam Weishaupt's headquarters for the Illuminati was found.
[03:03:04.860 --> 03:03:08.602]  It was the Lodge Theodore, also known as the Lodge St.
[03:03:08.682 --> 03:03:10.823]  Theodore Albon Council.
[03:03:11.003 --> 03:03:15.626]  Now that lodge is nowhere to be found on the internet, although we know it's here somewhere in the old city.
[03:03:15.686 --> 03:03:18.047]  A lot of that old city was destroyed in World War II.
[03:03:18.508 --> 03:03:20.969]  But very suggestive is the church behind me.
[03:03:21.380 --> 03:03:27.041]  That bears the all-seeing eye atop of it, the blazing emblem of the all-seeing eye with the triangle.
[03:03:27.182 --> 03:03:31.263]  By 1784, the Bavarian Illuminati had officially been exposed.
[03:03:31.643 --> 03:03:40.505]  The member list and the agenda had been found on a messenger killed when he was struck by lightning, and the monarchs in Bavaria had the list and shared it with other monarchs.
[03:03:40.825 --> 03:03:47.812]  The ruler of Bavaria, Karl Theodor, outlawed the secret society, banished Adam Weishaupt, and the other leaders scattered.
[03:03:48.433 --> 03:03:56.922]  Weishaupt himself avoided persecution under the protection to the end of his life by fellow Illuminist Duke Ernst of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.
[03:03:57.282 --> 03:04:08.149]  Second in command to the Illuminati, Adolf Freiherr von Carnegie ostensibly disbanded the group known internally as those whose name had been cursed by posterity.
[03:04:08.449 --> 03:04:14.633]  The Illuminati was officially over in 1785, and Carnegie stepped down from his position.
[03:04:14.973 --> 03:04:25.140]  However, historians have conclusively found that he successfully revived the Illuminati under the guise of numerous reading societies, as Weiss
[03:04:26.701 --> 03:04:27.762]  We're good to go.
[03:04:45.071 --> 03:04:48.872]  But assume another name and put forward new agents.
[03:04:49.512 --> 03:04:51.753]  This plan was carried out with precision.
[03:04:52.053 --> 03:05:07.138]  Top brass of the Illuminati, Von Knigge and Johann Joachim Christoph Bode, re-established the revolutionary organization under the guise of publishing houses that pushed for the printing of controversial Enlightenment literature.
[03:05:07.458 --> 03:05:17.750]  While operating behind the scenes via a clandestine inner circle that directed the agenda, these reading societies and publishing houses popped up across Europe and America.
[03:05:18.150 --> 03:05:22.815]  The German Union Publishing House operated on the Illuminati's home turf.
[03:05:23.516 --> 03:05:29.123]  While the Cirque du Soleil, based in Paris, played a critical role in the French Revolution.
[03:05:29.724 --> 03:05:35.652]  Their work in France was to be the beginning of a global revolution to take over the entire world.
[03:05:36.093 --> 03:05:40.258]  The original Bavarian Illuminati went underground and faded from existence.
[03:05:40.939 --> 03:05:43.640]  But the true legacy of the Illuminati continues.
[03:05:44.261 --> 03:05:56.187]  It was the embodiment of a working model for secret government, cleverly concealed within existing institutions and perpetuated by the lure of its secret mysteries and ambitious aims.
[03:05:56.427 --> 03:06:03.251]  But those occultic religious trappings were just a mask for the real model of infiltration and domination.
[03:06:04.071 --> 03:06:08.836]  The real Illuminati continued in other secret groups, working under other names.
[03:06:09.497 --> 03:06:20.929]  At their core, they were nothing more than private intelligence agencies, who carried out their agenda through the positions of power held by their elite membership, bonded by secrecy.
[03:06:48.843 --> 03:06:50.763]  Watch people's heads explode!
[03:06:51.163 --> 03:06:58.905]  Yeah, watch the NWO explode because we're coming live at you from InfoWars.com from our Central Command Station in Austin, Texas.
[03:06:59.325 --> 03:07:00.205]  And it's 4 a.m.
[03:07:00.225 --> 03:07:00.785]  Central Time.
[03:07:00.825 --> 03:07:05.186]  We're keeping you up all night, brother, because we're going to have another hour of the show.
[03:07:05.286 --> 03:07:08.907]  And we've got Rich Hamilton is going to be joining us momentarily, folks.
[03:07:08.947 --> 03:07:14.328]  But first, before I do that, again, call the number InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[03:07:14.768 --> 03:07:16.789]  We need the money to bring you more shows like this.
[03:07:16.849 --> 03:07:20.310]  And I just want to plug one item we have on InfoWarsHealth.com.
[03:07:20.750 --> 03:07:21.631]  It's pollen breasts.
[03:07:21.711 --> 03:07:22.871]  It's what's keeping me up all night.
[03:07:22.891 --> 03:07:25.572]  And half the guys have been here for like 14, 15 hours.
[03:07:26.412 --> 03:07:27.973]  Chris has been here for 32 hours.
[03:07:27.993 --> 03:07:30.094]  32 hours, whatever.
[03:07:30.634 --> 03:07:30.874]  Yeah.
[03:07:31.534 --> 03:07:33.175]  And this is what's been keeping us up, man.
[03:07:34.055 --> 03:07:36.036]  You got a whole box of these little packages.
[03:07:36.376 --> 03:07:37.296]  I think there's 30 in there.
[03:07:37.316 --> 03:07:39.817]  And again, InfoWarsHealth.com.
[03:07:39.917 --> 03:07:41.098]  And great tasting.
[03:07:41.178 --> 03:07:41.698]  I mean, we got
[03:07:43.394 --> 03:07:45.735]  Uh, Palm Burst Plus, this is great.
[03:07:45.755 --> 03:07:47.455]  Tastes like berry flavor.
[03:07:47.955 --> 03:07:53.097]  We got the Citrus Punch, all the other stuff, and there's a variety of different flavors, but this stuff is great.
[03:07:53.117 --> 03:07:55.338]  It's not like energy drink, because you get the crash, whatever.
[03:07:55.358 --> 03:07:56.618]  This is just B vitamins.
[03:07:56.718 --> 03:07:58.079]  I mean, it's incredible.
[03:07:58.099 --> 03:07:59.099]  You don't get no crash.
[03:07:59.119 --> 03:08:05.441]  You feel energized all day and feel good, because it's vitamins you do not get in, you know, drinks and food and everything else.
[03:08:05.581 --> 03:08:07.602]  And again, InfoWarsHealth.com.
[03:08:09.082 --> 03:08:15.569]  And if you go down, you got the Tangy Tangerine, you got the Palm Burst Packages, and we also got Rebound as well.
[03:08:16.070 --> 03:08:19.293]  And it's all on the website, InfoWarsStar.com, InfoWarsHealth.com.
[03:08:19.753 --> 03:08:20.875]  I mean, it's great products.
[03:08:20.975 --> 03:08:25.740]  I mean, like Aaron Dykes lost 80 pounds, I believe, or 92 pounds over this.
[03:08:26.240 --> 03:08:30.204]  And by the way, there was a great report by Aaron Dykes during a commercial break on the Illuminati.
[03:08:31.005 --> 03:08:34.067]  And I want to thank Mr. Schnobelens for coming on once again.
[03:08:34.727 --> 03:08:38.889]  And again, with oneaccord.org, that's his website.
[03:08:38.909 --> 03:08:40.470]  And this is why we need your funding, folks.
[03:08:40.890 --> 03:08:46.692]  Because we need to bring important people like him and Doc Marquis, the caller's been talking about, to bring them on.
[03:08:46.712 --> 03:08:49.394]  Wouldn't it be great to have them two on the show at once?
[03:08:50.114 --> 03:08:52.917]  I mean, it would be great with all the knowledge these guys have.
[03:08:53.337 --> 03:08:54.819]  You could look these guys up on YouTube.
[03:08:55.159 --> 03:08:57.021]  They go all over the country, do seminars.
[03:08:57.582 --> 03:08:59.163]  And I can't say enough about these guys.
[03:08:59.203 --> 03:09:01.165]  I mean, these guys are on the target.
[03:09:01.265 --> 03:09:04.449]  I mean, they're exposing the symbolism on the dollar bill and all that other stuff.
[03:09:05.029 --> 03:09:07.231]  But anyway, Rich Anatone, how you doing, man?
[03:09:08.012 --> 03:09:08.532]  Not bad, man.
[03:09:08.672 --> 03:09:09.373]  It's good to see you.
[03:09:09.513 --> 03:09:10.833]  Yeah, you too, man.
[03:09:11.193 --> 03:09:16.156]  Rich Antoni's been my co-host because I had a radio talk show in Rhode Island called Truth Radio.
[03:09:16.236 --> 03:09:19.497]  It was truthradio.cc and truthradioshow.com.
[03:09:19.977 --> 03:09:23.219]  And Rich has been my co-host for about three years now and we...
[03:09:24.219 --> 03:09:25.180]  It's great to be here.
[03:09:25.200 --> 03:09:26.881]  It's been a while since you and I were
[03:09:54.301 --> 03:09:56.103]  We're doing any kind of radio together, y'all.
[03:09:56.123 --> 03:09:59.706]  I'm in Texas, I'm in Indiana, and yeah, it's good to see you, man.
[03:09:59.947 --> 03:10:08.115]  Yeah, two good ol' boys from Rhode Island, you know, now I'm in Texas, you're in Indiana, and I mean, that'd be great if you could come down here to work someday, you know, that'd be awesome.
[03:10:08.315 --> 03:10:10.157]  Yeah, eventually, man.
[03:10:10.177 --> 03:10:14.762]  Alex, he's a great journalist, expert in economics, just about, and...
[03:10:15.202 --> 03:10:18.965]  I mean, this guy is well-rounded, folks, when it comes to fighting in the world order.
[03:10:18.985 --> 03:10:29.412]  And this is why Adam is my co-host for years, and, uh, you know, we interview great people like, uh, uh, the, uh, John, uh, what's his name, uh, Adams from the FBI agent, John Adams?
[03:10:29.552 --> 03:10:30.692]  Oh, yeah, Don Adams.
[03:10:30.712 --> 03:10:31.353]  Don Adams, yeah.
[03:10:33.374 --> 03:10:33.714]  Awesome.
[03:10:34.075 --> 03:10:37.577]  And today we're going to talk about basically the news, what's going on during the week.
[03:10:37.797 --> 03:10:45.283]  I mean, I know we're shifting gears here from the Illuminati, but we need to cover the highlight, you know, all the top stories that occurred over the weekend.
[03:10:45.303 --> 03:10:46.163]  It is so much.
[03:10:46.263 --> 03:10:48.005]  I mean, you better keep it up, Bradshaw.
[03:10:48.045 --> 03:10:49.506]  I mean, like, wow.
[03:10:49.726 --> 03:10:52.008]  I mean, that's all you can say is like one week's time.
[03:10:52.028 --> 03:10:52.328]  I mean.
[03:10:53.720 --> 03:10:58.164]  Time seems to be getting faster, and faster and faster.
[03:11:02.107 --> 03:11:07.332]  Things get worse and worse, things get faster and faster, and eventually we'll have a new dictator.
[03:11:07.412 --> 03:11:10.755]  That's pretty much all one can really look forward to, I suppose.
[03:11:11.175 --> 03:11:20.381]  Yeah, and that's what I'm going to talk about with Bill, but I mean, since you're on, me and you have been talking about the politics a lot, and I know people, politics and economics, they're boring stuff.
[03:11:20.541 --> 03:11:21.181]  They really are.
[03:11:21.602 --> 03:11:22.782]  It's boring to hear, but you know what?
[03:11:23.143 --> 03:11:26.985]  You need to hear this stuff because it's the foundation of this new world order.
[03:11:27.405 --> 03:11:30.387]  Politics, because it's politicians who want to put the anti-Christ in power.
[03:11:30.828 --> 03:11:34.210]  It's economics is the one that brings us into this global one-world currency.
[03:11:34.810 --> 03:11:37.232]  And I know it's a boring subject, but I mean, it's good.
[03:11:37.352 --> 03:11:38.252]  And we're going to cover U.S.
[03:11:38.292 --> 03:11:46.977]  news as well, but, you know, QE3, I mean, like, I know this is a little old news now, but I mean, like, I want your take on this whole bailout.
[03:11:47.217 --> 03:11:48.438]  I mean, what do you think about it?
[03:11:49.018 --> 03:11:54.562]  I mean, it's nothing more than the slow murder of the United States dollar.
[03:11:55.393 --> 03:11:57.434]  I mean, it's indefinite money printing.
[03:11:57.474 --> 03:11:58.495]  Indefinite money printing.
[03:11:58.535 --> 03:12:03.539]  As long as other countries use our money, it's not going to be as bad.
[03:12:03.619 --> 03:12:12.365]  But I mean, there's only going to be so long before other countries begin to realize how much of a joke our currency has become.
[03:12:12.745 --> 03:12:18.189]  And then when other currencies or when other countries stop using our dollar, we're going to see massive inflation here.
[03:12:18.549 --> 03:12:20.490]  It's just a matter of time before the dollar is dead.
[03:12:21.651 --> 03:12:24.073]  Oh yeah, you know the thing is, they might as well just do it now.
[03:12:24.093 --> 03:12:26.534]  Never mind the bailout, just do it now and get it over with.
[03:12:26.574 --> 03:12:29.096]  Because that's, all you're doing is prolonging things.
[03:12:29.156 --> 03:12:31.097]  And the things we need to get rid of the Federal Reserve.
[03:12:31.157 --> 03:12:38.781]  And I know, you know, because we talk about this so much on Infowars.com, about the Federal Reserve, about QE3, the economic crisis.
[03:12:39.221 --> 03:12:39.802]  But you know what?
[03:12:40.762 --> 03:12:43.444]  The best thing to do is get rid of the Federal Reserve.
[03:12:43.504 --> 03:12:44.805]  That right there would solve the problem.
[03:12:44.825 --> 03:12:46.085]  You've got to cut the head off the snake.
[03:12:46.386 --> 03:12:48.547]  Never mind the little tentacles of the octopus.
[03:12:48.867 --> 03:12:50.228]  You need to go after the head of it.
[03:12:50.905 --> 03:13:00.631]  Yeah, as Tom Woods likes to talk about, he's like, getting rid of the Federal Reserve is good, but you have to replace it with something that's not like the Federal Reserve.
[03:13:01.391 --> 03:13:07.055]  And a lot of criticisms with people who want to end the Fed, a lot of people say, oh, well, you know.
[03:13:07.535 --> 03:13:18.522]  You think that if you just get rid of the Fed, everything will go back to normal, or if you want to replace a fiat dollar with a gold-backed currency, then you think that that will solve all of our problems.
[03:13:18.582 --> 03:13:20.584]  No one's saying it's going to solve all of our problems.
[03:13:21.044 --> 03:13:26.387]  We're saying it's going to make things better if you actually have a commodity-backed monetary policy.
[03:13:26.648 --> 03:13:33.732]  It's not going to fix all the problems overnight, but like you said, you've got to start with the correct thing, which is what Ron Paul wanted to do.
[03:13:34.052 --> 03:13:36.114]  Ron Paul wanted to introduce currencies.
[03:13:36.554 --> 03:13:37.014]  Yeah, I think so.
[03:13:55.320 --> 03:14:00.064]  People are going to wake up in various states and they're going to allow for competing currencies.
[03:14:00.345 --> 03:14:01.265]  It's just a matter of time.
[03:14:01.826 --> 03:14:07.331]  It's just a matter of time before the dollar is dead and before people start to realize we need something different.
[03:14:07.961 --> 03:14:11.043]  Absolutely, and um, I mean, we're in a mess, Rich.
[03:14:11.123 --> 03:14:19.469]  I mean, like, we've been covering news for a few years now at least, and um, you know, we've been, we grew up watching Alex just about, and uh, we're in a mess.
[03:14:19.509 --> 03:14:31.458]  We're in a big hole, I mean, and it seems like, you know, people, I hear comments, I see comments on YouTube all the time, and hear people, oh, uh, Alex, he preaches doom and gloom, uh, InfoWise, all they preach is fear-mongering.
[03:14:31.838 --> 03:14:35.501]  No, we don't, because if you actually listen to the show, instead of running your mouth,
[03:14:36.081 --> 03:14:41.825]  He would actually say, yeah, we have to push the doom and gloom for us to let you know, hey, smack you in the face, hey, wake the hell up!
[03:14:42.065 --> 03:14:43.006]  Bottom line, wake up!
[03:14:43.026 --> 03:14:46.529]  Yeah, man, if you're, if you're, if the guy had, like, if the guy's on fire...
[03:14:47.395 --> 03:14:49.677]  Bad example, because he should probably know that he's on fire.
[03:14:50.037 --> 03:14:54.181]  But you've got to let people know that, you know, hey man, your house is on fire.
[03:14:54.541 --> 03:14:55.081]  Exactly.
[03:14:55.101 --> 03:14:56.522]  That's not doom and gloom.
[03:14:56.562 --> 03:14:59.845]  That's, hey guy, I'm trying to help you, your house is on fire.
[03:14:59.865 --> 03:15:01.066]  And what do they expect?
[03:15:01.186 --> 03:15:11.474]  I mean, you have to promote doom and gloom first, but Alex is constantly, if you actually listen to him, people out there, some of you out there, he constantly offers solutions and ways to, you know,
[03:15:12.655 --> 03:15:14.576]  You know, things that matter and all that.
[03:15:14.636 --> 03:15:16.997]  And people quickly, they hear half a story.
[03:15:17.017 --> 03:15:18.918]  You know, you know how that goes.
[03:15:18.938 --> 03:15:21.118]  You have half a story and it spreads like wildfire, whatever.
[03:15:21.198 --> 03:15:23.239]  But if you actually listen to the guy and all that.
[03:15:23.259 --> 03:15:26.140]  I mean, it's just like, we're in a mess, folks.
[03:15:26.300 --> 03:15:28.321]  And we got lots of news to cover.
[03:15:28.361 --> 03:15:29.762]  I mean, I haven't touched half of it yet.
[03:15:30.562 --> 03:15:32.124]  And I want to get your take on that.
[03:15:32.244 --> 03:15:36.969]  And also, you listeners out there, 1-877-789-ALEX, Open Topics.
[03:15:37.650 --> 03:15:45.879]  And we want to talk about the economic crisis, politics of Romney, Obama, Obama, Obama, and Homeland Security.
[03:15:45.899 --> 03:15:48.762]  Hey Rich, you see that commercial with the Obama phone girl?
[03:15:50.487 --> 03:15:52.771]  I've seen the interview with the Obama phone girl.
[03:15:52.792 --> 03:15:53.693]  I haven't seen the commercial.
[03:15:53.713 --> 03:15:55.036]  I mean, that's commercial.
[03:15:55.877 --> 03:15:57.681]  It's late at night here.
[03:15:57.701 --> 03:15:58.682]  Yeah, the YouTube video.
[03:15:58.883 --> 03:16:01.067]  The woman saying that he gave us a phone.
[03:16:01.107 --> 03:16:01.548]  He gave us a phone.
[03:16:01.568 --> 03:16:02.710]  Yeah, you guys want to play that quick?
[03:16:03.922 --> 03:16:05.423]  I don't know if you have that in the tricaster.
[03:16:05.763 --> 03:16:06.404]  It's upsetting.
[03:16:06.744 --> 03:16:07.565]  It's embarrassing.
[03:16:07.765 --> 03:16:09.166]  Yeah, when you're ready, just throw it on screen.
[03:16:09.186 --> 03:16:10.227]  But it's hilarious.
[03:16:10.327 --> 03:16:12.208]  I mean, we've been playing this all week.
[03:16:12.288 --> 03:16:14.290]  It's the new thing at Infowars.com.
[03:16:14.390 --> 03:16:17.752]  And we've all been just laughing about it.
[03:16:18.253 --> 03:16:20.174]  But it shows the poverty of America.
[03:16:20.294 --> 03:16:21.555]  It really does.
[03:16:21.575 --> 03:16:22.476]  And that's the sad thing.
[03:16:22.556 --> 03:16:24.137]  It's funny, but it's sad.
[03:16:24.217 --> 03:16:24.717]  It really is.
[03:16:26.579 --> 03:16:31.901]  I feel bad laughing at that girl, because what they've done to people.
[03:16:32.682 --> 03:16:36.684]  What they've stuck people down to this submissive, we've got to depend on the government.
[03:16:37.044 --> 03:16:38.065]  There he is right there.
[03:16:41.781 --> 03:16:43.743]  He gave us a phone.
[03:16:44.223 --> 03:16:46.405]  He gave you a phone?
[03:16:46.425 --> 03:16:49.168]  How did he give you a phone?
[03:16:49.228 --> 03:16:54.934]  You're on full stamps, you're on social security, you got low income, you disability.
[03:16:55.014 --> 03:16:56.696]  Okay, what's wrong with Romney again?
[03:16:59.839 --> 03:17:00.379]  That's great.
[03:17:00.659 --> 03:17:02.080]  We got one here with Elmo.
[03:17:02.320 --> 03:17:04.080]  You know, it's Elmo being interviewed on TV.
[03:17:04.180 --> 03:17:05.721]  It's on YouTube, whatever.
[03:17:05.761 --> 03:17:07.141]  Just type Elmo Obama phone.
[03:17:07.181 --> 03:17:07.621]  It's great.
[03:17:08.181 --> 03:17:08.742]  Oh, God.
[03:17:09.142 --> 03:17:10.502]  And yeah, people give us a call.
[03:17:10.522 --> 03:17:12.103]  1-877-789-ALEX.
[03:17:12.303 --> 03:17:13.623]  Let's load the phone lines.
[03:17:13.683 --> 03:17:14.463]  It's 4 a.m.
[03:17:14.503 --> 03:17:16.164]  here in FEMA Region 6.
[03:17:16.224 --> 03:17:17.444]  Let's wake people up.
[03:17:17.764 --> 03:17:18.924]  Let's wake up America.
[03:17:18.944 --> 03:17:19.945]  Let's wake up the world.
[03:17:20.505 --> 03:17:23.186]  On with the charge against the new world order.
[03:17:23.466 --> 03:17:24.786]  And we need your support, people.
[03:17:24.946 --> 03:17:25.546]  Money Bomb.
[03:17:25.586 --> 03:17:27.067]  Infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[03:17:28.187 --> 03:17:31.208]  And, uh, we gotta, I mean, I'm on fire, man.
[03:17:31.228 --> 03:17:32.828]  I could go for another four hours, man.
[03:17:32.848 --> 03:17:35.209]  I tell ya, I'm gonna be on tomorrow night, too, people.
[03:17:36.149 --> 03:17:36.509]  1 a.m.
[03:17:36.569 --> 03:17:40.810]  Central, I'll be on for four hours tomorrow, and we got a stunning show for you.
[03:17:40.830 --> 03:17:41.690]  We got tons of guests.
[03:17:41.750 --> 03:17:43.251]  I got, uh, let me get the list here.
[03:17:45.411 --> 03:17:47.472]  We got, um, the Hernandez family.
[03:17:50.211 --> 03:17:54.334]  It's funny, that's great stuff.
[03:17:54.374 --> 03:18:00.759]  People, it just shows the... I don't mean to make it funny for folks, I really don't.
[03:18:00.839 --> 03:18:03.662]  It is funny in a way, but...
[03:18:19.986 --> 03:18:20.767]  The Obamaphone.
[03:18:20.807 --> 03:18:22.008]  I mean, there's tons of videos out there.
[03:18:22.048 --> 03:18:24.130]  I think the video's got six million hits now, whatever.
[03:18:24.150 --> 03:18:29.296]  Oh yeah, tomorrow we're gonna have Steve Hernandez, the Hernandez family from San Antonio on.
[03:18:29.656 --> 03:18:32.860]  Actually, I might have you come back tomorrow, Rich, if you want to be on again.
[03:18:35.117 --> 03:18:35.657]  You there, Richard?
[03:18:36.258 --> 03:18:36.658]  Yeah, I'm here.
[03:18:37.018 --> 03:18:40.660]  Oh, yeah, I'll probably have you come back on at the end of the show again tomorrow.
[03:18:41.040 --> 03:18:41.360]  Sure, man.
[03:18:41.400 --> 03:18:43.021]  I'll be around, so let me know.
[03:18:43.461 --> 03:18:47.003]  And we're going to have the Hernandez family with the RFID chip in San Antonio.
[03:18:47.163 --> 03:18:48.403]  They're going to be coming on tomorrow.
[03:18:48.903 --> 03:18:51.024]  And, you know, they're going to have James Miller.
[03:18:51.385 --> 03:18:53.306]  This guy, he's a good friend of mine from Orlando.
[03:18:53.766 --> 03:18:54.786]  They deported his wife.
[03:18:54.826 --> 03:18:56.927]  His wife, you know, he was legally married to her.
[03:18:56.947 --> 03:18:58.868]  She had a job, a tax status.
[03:18:58.888 --> 03:19:00.689]  She was paying taxes, a good citizen.
[03:19:01.109 --> 03:19:02.090]  And they deported her.
[03:19:02.570 --> 03:19:04.531]  And now he spends every time he goes to travel to see her.
[03:19:05.131 --> 03:19:06.372]  They harass him.
[03:19:06.552 --> 03:19:09.593]  They detain them and tell them they expect us every time we travel.
[03:19:09.873 --> 03:19:15.135]  Because we had him on our show last year, and ever since then he's been under a lot of scrutiny.
[03:19:15.155 --> 03:19:21.877]  Every time he travels, they pull him into the customs agency, pull him in to basically tell you, you gotta expect us every time you travel.
[03:19:21.957 --> 03:19:23.358]  They harass him big time.
[03:19:23.698 --> 03:19:28.060]  Then we got Michael Murphy from Why in the World Are They Spraying?
[03:19:28.140 --> 03:19:31.181]  I mean, the guy's amazing, about chemtrails and everything else.
[03:19:31.221 --> 03:19:33.722]  And we got Christopher Keyes from SWAT.
[03:19:34.622 --> 03:19:40.527]  I mean, if you type Christopher Keyes, Swats, SwatsEdge.com, you know, great stuff.
[03:19:40.567 --> 03:19:46.492]  But anyway, Rich, let's get into some news, and we got the phone lines packing up here, and we're giving them another few minutes here.
[03:19:47.213 --> 03:19:54.819]  And this hasn't been confirmed yet, but it was an article from October 7th, Homeland Security graduates first corps of homeland youth.
[03:19:55.680 --> 03:20:04.771]  Now, it says on September 13th, 2012, the Department of Homeland Security graduated its first class of FEMA co-ops youth, a.k.a.
[03:20:04.831 --> 03:20:10.078]  Homeland Security youth, and it sounds like the Hitler youth, if you ask me, and it hasn't been confirmed yet.
[03:20:10.438 --> 03:20:11.780]  So, people, don't take this...
[03:20:13.101 --> 03:20:17.484]  Serious right now, because we haven't confirmed the source yet, but there's articles surfacing everywhere about it.
[03:20:18.025 --> 03:20:20.827]  And it's from President Obama's AmeriCorps volunteers.
[03:20:20.947 --> 03:20:25.270]  Now, we gotta get a hold of the AmeriCorps Volunteers Foundation to see if this is actually true.
[03:20:25.590 --> 03:20:27.411]  But if it is, I mean, they got a picture right here.
[03:20:28.372 --> 03:20:30.794]  If you want to zoom in, I'll get a document cam here.
[03:20:30.814 --> 03:20:37.478]  And of about 200 kids, 200 kids graduating to Homeland Security.
[03:20:37.518 --> 03:20:39.000]  I mean, what is going on, Rich?
[03:20:42.249 --> 03:20:43.874]  You know as well as I do, man.
[03:20:43.935 --> 03:20:46.323]  They're indoctrinating the youth.
[03:20:47.670 --> 03:20:52.635]  And they're preparing society for civil unrest.
[03:20:53.075 --> 03:20:55.817]  You know, you control the youth, you control the next generation.
[03:20:56.198 --> 03:20:59.561]  You control the next generation, you basically control the future.
[03:21:00.121 --> 03:21:04.585]  And so we saw this, we see this anytime the children are being told to spy on their parents.
[03:21:05.025 --> 03:21:08.869]  We see this where the children are singing ridiculous songs, praising the leader.
[03:21:09.309 --> 03:21:12.211]  We see this with, you know, government indoctrination everywhere.
[03:21:12.231 --> 03:21:12.872]  It's just another phase.
[03:21:14.353 --> 03:21:18.434]  Like we said, things are going faster, so we're going to see more weird stuff like this.
[03:21:34.418 --> 03:21:35.978]  Adolf Hitler did the same thing.
[03:21:36.038 --> 03:21:37.259]  He had youth brigades.
[03:21:38.119 --> 03:21:39.959]  And when he was rising up to power, the whole world loved him.
[03:21:39.979 --> 03:21:40.960]  Yeah, but that's not Obama.
[03:21:40.980 --> 03:21:42.000]  That's going to be fine.
[03:21:42.040 --> 03:21:43.080]  It's not Obama.
[03:21:43.300 --> 03:21:45.621]  You're being crazy comparing this to Hitler.
[03:21:45.641 --> 03:21:46.221]  What's wrong with you?
[03:21:46.261 --> 03:21:46.421]  Come on.
[03:21:46.481 --> 03:21:47.401]  Yeah, it's terrorist talk.
[03:21:47.861 --> 03:21:49.102]  Learning history.
[03:21:49.122 --> 03:21:50.442]  Bad man terrorist talk.
[03:21:50.482 --> 03:21:54.003]  You don't talk that way because we'll come in and shut you down.
[03:21:54.023 --> 03:21:58.784]  We'll arrest you like we did the return of veterans, the talk show host and everything, which is undocumented.
[03:21:59.184 --> 03:22:01.245]  You know, they're targeting returning vets.
[03:22:01.265 --> 03:22:03.886]  That's in the MIAC report, which I've got right here.
[03:22:03.906 --> 03:22:05.427]  Actually, let me run through that quick.
[03:22:06.508 --> 03:22:07.868]  I mean, this is disgusting, folks.
[03:22:07.928 --> 03:22:10.029]  I mean, this is from the horse's mouth again.
[03:22:10.610 --> 03:22:13.011]  Before I go on here and talk about something, I get positive proof.
[03:22:13.631 --> 03:22:16.513]  And no, folks, it's not a conspiracy that they're targeting returning vets.
[03:22:17.033 --> 03:22:17.553]  Like, it's not.
[03:22:18.234 --> 03:22:19.794]  You got the Patriot Act, okay?
[03:22:20.055 --> 03:22:21.215]  We got the documents here.
[03:22:21.235 --> 03:22:24.337]  There's some of them we had to print a couple pages out because they're so damn dick.
[03:22:25.866 --> 03:22:35.794]  You got the HR 5122, the John Warner National Defense Act, that annul posse comitatus, which is unconstitutional, shouldn't be a law.
[03:22:36.374 --> 03:22:39.877]  Then remember S3081, John McCain's belligerent bill?
[03:22:40.558 --> 03:22:42.460]  You can't talk bad about the government!
[03:22:42.820 --> 03:22:43.180]  No!
[03:22:43.821 --> 03:22:46.963]  You can't talk bad about the government because you'd be a terrorist, you should be locked up!
[03:22:48.044 --> 03:22:49.745]  Then they're going even further.
[03:22:50.305 --> 03:22:54.327]  The National Defense Authorization Act just put the Patriot Act on steroids!
[03:22:54.968 --> 03:22:55.208]  Yeah.
[03:22:55.468 --> 03:22:56.789]  Man, I mean, like, it's crazy.
[03:22:56.829 --> 03:23:00.491]  Didn't you see this with the radicalization into violent extreme?
[03:23:00.911 --> 03:23:03.972]  If you disagree with the mainstream media, you're a terrorist.
[03:23:03.992 --> 03:23:09.995]  You are a terrorist, Rich, because you told me earlier that you don't agree with Obama, so you should be locked up, you racist.
[03:23:10.036 --> 03:23:14.158]  I mean, everyone is going to get locked up if they have their way.
[03:23:15.327 --> 03:23:18.288]  Oh, let's not forget, um, you know, Project Megiddo from the FBI.
[03:23:18.688 --> 03:23:20.188]  You could PDF all these files, folks.
[03:23:20.728 --> 03:23:23.949]  They say anybody who believes in Bible prophecy, you're a terrorist.
[03:23:24.289 --> 03:23:25.869]  It says it right in the document.
[03:23:26.310 --> 03:23:28.890]  If you're against the New World Order, you're a terrorist.
[03:23:29.170 --> 03:23:32.531]  Oh, and then the MIAC report, yeah, returning veterans were coming after you.
[03:23:32.851 --> 03:23:38.432]  And also, Endgame, I just showed earlier, Endgame from Homeland Security, you're a returning veteran.
[03:23:38.452 --> 03:23:40.753]  Ron Paul's support right in the MIAC report as well.
[03:23:41.033 --> 03:23:42.413]  You're a terrorist and we're coming after you.
[03:23:42.433 --> 03:23:43.854]  So they're coming after you, Rich.
[03:23:43.874 --> 03:23:44.794]  You better lock your door, man.
[03:23:45.334 --> 03:23:46.836]  Oh, yeah, my door's nice and locked.
[03:23:46.876 --> 03:23:54.243]  I got three bolts on that one, but... They had the, uh, what was that, document that came out in 2009, I think?
[03:23:54.343 --> 03:24:05.815]  It was a Department of Justice glossary of various terms that conspiracy theorists and, uh, it was actually terminology by extremists and potential terrorists.
[03:24:06.275 --> 03:24:22.631]  And everything that we talk about, everything from biblical money, to council on foreign relations, to genetically modified food, to take our country back, all these were terms that the Department of Justice is telling local law enforcement to go on the lookout for.
[03:24:22.971 --> 03:24:30.218]  Make sure if you hear these people talking about this, that you pay more attention to them, because they might be a domestic terrorist or radical extremist.
[03:24:30.979 --> 03:24:31.340]  Exactly.
[03:24:31.360 --> 03:24:31.680]  It's ridiculous.
[03:24:31.720 --> 03:24:34.222]  The government, Dan, the government lies to you.
[03:24:34.542 --> 03:24:35.804]  They take away your freedoms.
[03:24:36.064 --> 03:24:37.805]  Then they lie to you about taking away your freedoms.
[03:24:37.845 --> 03:24:38.566]  Oh no, no, no.
[03:24:38.586 --> 03:24:39.046]  They don't do that.
[03:24:39.066 --> 03:24:43.230]  And then they call you a terrorist when you complain about them taking away your freedoms and lying to you about it.
[03:24:43.310 --> 03:24:48.495]  You can't say that because you didn't build that either, by the way, your apartment, you didn't build that, whatever.
[03:24:48.995 --> 03:24:52.518]  You can't say that at all because the government's out for our best interest.
[03:24:52.559 --> 03:24:54.620]  I mean, look, they're giving Obama phones to us.
[03:24:54.700 --> 03:24:55.301]  Isn't it great?
[03:24:55.321 --> 03:24:55.982]  Obama gave us a phone?
[03:24:56.562 --> 03:24:57.563]  Yeah, he gave us a phone.
[03:24:57.583 --> 03:24:58.364]  I mean, isn't it great?
[03:24:58.905 --> 03:25:01.207]  I mean, he's going to do more, too, like that lady said.
[03:25:01.267 --> 03:25:03.530]  And we shouldn't be talking bad about the government.
[03:25:03.610 --> 03:25:04.531]  There's a song again.
[03:25:07.013 --> 03:25:08.235]  This is great, you know.
[03:25:12.599 --> 03:25:14.020]  InfoWars Money Bomb folks.
[03:25:14.281 --> 03:25:15.822]  InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[03:25:16.182 --> 03:25:25.749]  We're up to $109,000 and folks that's not it's a lot sounds like a lot but it doesn't cover a year of overtake overhead here in the InfoWars studio.
[03:25:26.470 --> 03:25:32.895]  I mean man I tell you what I mean it's just it's been a great ride here InfoWars.
[03:25:32.935 --> 03:25:40.340]  I mean I love it working here and everything else and yeah we're gonna cover some news and actually we got our phone the phone lines are loaded.
[03:25:40.540 --> 03:25:40.700]  Wow.
[03:25:41.821 --> 03:25:43.462]  Anyway, we've got Alex from Ohio.
[03:25:43.682 --> 03:25:45.163]  Alex from Ohio, how are you doing?
[03:25:45.183 --> 03:25:47.825]  How are you doing?
[03:25:48.405 --> 03:25:49.346]  Oh, great.
[03:25:49.406 --> 03:25:52.307]  Great from FEMA Region 6 when our liberties have been taken away.
[03:25:52.908 --> 03:25:54.889]  Oh, that's awesome.
[03:25:55.009 --> 03:26:02.773]  Well, I've been, first off, I check and go on InfoWars like four times a day and RT all the time.
[03:26:02.793 --> 03:26:04.074]  I love your guys' show.
[03:26:04.094 --> 03:26:04.494]  Oh, thank you.
[03:26:04.534 --> 03:26:07.556]  I watch all the videos, especially Police State 4.
[03:26:07.596 --> 03:26:08.497]  I love that film.
[03:26:09.638 --> 03:26:28.689]  What I want to talk to you about today is I found out recently, the day before the Occupy Cleveland One Year Anniversary, I was talking to a friend, I don't want to mention his name, lived with the Cleveland Five, and he actually let me know, this is really scary, honestly, my heart's beating so fast.
[03:26:28.969 --> 03:26:31.971]  Oh, that's all right, take your time, brother.
[03:26:32.031 --> 03:26:32.972]  I mean, you got the floor, man.
[03:26:34.072 --> 03:26:36.893]  I mean, this is my first time calling, so it's really big news.
[03:26:37.133 --> 03:26:37.653]  Oh, thank you.
[03:26:37.913 --> 03:26:49.495]  He told me that the FBI informant threatened all of them that if they did not go along with the plan, that they were going to have the mafia kill them and their families.
[03:26:50.695 --> 03:26:50.976]  Wow.
[03:26:51.676 --> 03:26:52.996]  Yeah, that's just bulliness.
[03:26:53.076 --> 03:26:57.697]  I mean, they just want to intimidate you, and the worst thing you can do is ever go with a threat.
[03:26:58.430 --> 03:27:08.194]  Yeah, me and one of the other occupiers, I mean I was one of the first to visit Brandon, to visit Tony, to visit, well they got it wrong, they said Scully, but it's Skelly.
[03:27:10.275 --> 03:27:22.860]  But it's just, it's really, it's nerve-wracking to know that we're headed in a dark direction, knowing, especially recently with the New York, you know, that was obvious, the FBI entrapment.
[03:27:23.200 --> 03:27:23.961]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:27:24.001 --> 03:27:33.246]  I mean, every time, if you notice, every time there's a so-called terror attempt, you know, terror attack attempt, guess who's got their fingers in the mix?
[03:27:33.466 --> 03:27:34.187]  It's the FBI.
[03:27:34.667 --> 03:27:39.590]  They admit, they come out and admit, yeah, we gave them the bomb, we coached them, we taught them how to shoot the gun, whatever.
[03:27:39.970 --> 03:27:45.974]  But you talk about your conspiracy, Derrison, yeah, under these army manuals, you should be locked up.
[03:27:47.382 --> 03:28:05.751]  I mean, I've been with Oxby Cleveland since December 20th, and I mean, I was there when, on March 5th, we had a, we went to the sheriff's cell of the foreclosed home, you know, stealing the homes and selling them off, and, you know, when Brandon Baxter and all those were found, and actually the most craziest thing was, I was,
[03:28:07.133 --> 03:28:07.714]  We're good to go.
[03:28:20.653 --> 03:28:21.914]  Uh, you know, the whole bomb plot thing.
[03:28:22.174 --> 03:28:26.215]  I get woken up on, like, we hear, ah, we're like, what's going on?
[03:28:26.235 --> 03:28:29.957]  You know, they just got caught trying to blow up the bridge.
[03:28:29.997 --> 03:28:30.617]  And we're like, what?
[03:28:30.657 --> 03:28:36.460]  And then we jumped out of the, out of the, you know, out of there, you know, out of the tents that we had inside our warehouse.
[03:28:36.500 --> 03:28:37.980]  We were just freaking out.
[03:28:38.921 --> 03:28:44.123]  And so, I mean, we were really under some, you know, trauma and then, you know,
[03:28:45.098 --> 03:28:50.321]  I don't know if I want to say too much more about this, but... Oh, no, no, don't be afraid!
[03:28:50.341 --> 03:28:52.041]  The thing is, do not be afraid of these people.
[03:28:52.441 --> 03:28:53.782]  When you... Truth, okay?
[03:28:53.802 --> 03:28:55.663]  A real truth that we'll voice out, okay?
[03:28:55.683 --> 03:29:02.206]  Without fear, because we're like... I don't know if you heard the show earlier about, you know, Mr. Snowden, like how he expressed, we're not afraid.
[03:29:02.566 --> 03:29:05.948]  You know, when you're out for truth, you're out to do something good, okay?
[03:29:06.249 --> 03:29:07.689]  God's got that protection over you.
[03:29:07.730 --> 03:29:10.371]  There's nothing these scumbags can do about it, and that's what they hate about it.
[03:29:10.631 --> 03:29:13.754]  They hate the fact that they- you're a creature, okay?
[03:29:13.794 --> 03:29:15.775]  That's creating an image of God.
[03:29:15.935 --> 03:29:16.515]  They'll create it.
[03:29:16.555 --> 03:29:17.096]  They hate that.
[03:29:17.296 --> 03:29:18.677]  That's why they want to destroy you.
[03:29:18.917 --> 03:29:20.298]  That's why Lucifer, okay?
[03:29:21.199 --> 03:29:23.060]  He wants to destroy humankind.
[03:29:23.120 --> 03:29:26.222]  Mankind put together because we're made in God's image.
[03:29:26.702 --> 03:29:29.186]  And they'll do anything to make you fear and intimidated.
[03:29:29.206 --> 03:29:31.970]  They'll say, you know, you keep your mouth shut, you little scumbag.
[03:29:31.990 --> 03:29:33.833]  We're going to squeeze the life out of you.
[03:29:33.853 --> 03:29:34.293]  But you know what?
[03:29:34.433 --> 03:29:39.481]  They're not going to squeeze the life out of liberty because just like in 1776, we fought through adversity.
[03:29:39.501 --> 03:29:42.165]  The odds were overwhelming.
[03:29:42.225 --> 03:29:42.685]  But you know what?
[03:29:43.286 --> 03:29:44.206]  Keep the faith, brother.
[03:29:44.266 --> 03:29:48.968]  Keep the spirit of liberty in 1776 and the spirit of God in you.
[03:29:49.368 --> 03:29:50.248]  And just blast them.
[03:29:50.368 --> 03:29:53.749]  Go out there with a bullhorn and say, hey, I know your stuff.
[03:29:53.869 --> 03:29:54.690]  I know what you're doing.
[03:29:55.010 --> 03:29:56.210]  And I'm standing up against you.
[03:29:56.230 --> 03:29:56.690]  And that's it.
[03:29:56.710 --> 03:29:57.270]  You know what I mean?
[03:29:57.350 --> 03:29:58.631]  And you get other people to do it.
[03:29:58.931 --> 03:30:01.272]  And if they threaten you, you go out with twice as much force.
[03:30:01.852 --> 03:30:06.313]  And remember, because if God wants you to do something, you stand up for truth and liberty, you will not be defeated.
[03:30:06.413 --> 03:30:06.973]  Bottom line.
[03:30:07.674 --> 03:30:11.595]  And we're going to go to the next caller, Anthony from Wisconsin.
[03:30:11.615 --> 03:30:12.095]  How are you doing?
[03:30:13.772 --> 03:30:14.653]  Hey, how's it going?
[03:30:14.673 --> 03:30:15.513]  Can you hear me?
[03:30:15.933 --> 03:30:18.435]  Yep, and if you want to ask me or Richard a question, go ahead.
[03:30:19.295 --> 03:30:20.996]  Alright, I'm really excited.
[03:30:21.096 --> 03:30:24.698]  I'm a first-time caller and a long-time listener.
[03:30:24.959 --> 03:30:26.820]  I love what you guys are doing over there.
[03:30:26.900 --> 03:30:28.421]  InfoWars is just the best.
[03:30:28.541 --> 03:30:29.541]  Thank you.
[03:30:29.661 --> 03:30:30.322]  You guys rule.
[03:30:30.922 --> 03:30:32.743]  And I'm 22 years old.
[03:30:32.843 --> 03:30:36.085]  I just graduated from St.
[03:30:36.205 --> 03:30:38.566]  Norbert College in Green Bay and De Pere.
[03:30:38.727 --> 03:30:41.148]  It's right by where the Packers play, kind of.
[03:30:41.841 --> 03:30:50.365]  And, um, I have a history major there and I just am getting so, uh, just, just getting so pumped about what you guys are doing over there, I would just, I would love to talk to you guys about it.
[03:30:50.385 --> 03:30:53.067]  Yeah, that's what I want to hear, right there, right there, that's what I want to hear.
[03:30:53.087 --> 03:31:02.392]  4.32 in the morning Central Time, you got a man that's getting pumped, getting pumped because we're charging into the New World Order, Money Bomb, InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com, and keep up the spirit, man.
[03:31:02.452 --> 03:31:03.172]  And you got a question?
[03:31:04.152 --> 03:31:06.594]  Yes, I, uh, I was, I just wanted to say something.
[03:31:06.714 --> 03:31:09.075]  I, I wanted to just give a shout out to Bill.
[03:31:10.457 --> 03:31:25.536]  I saw that he was on just right before Rich was on and I'm just excited about that because I really like you guys were bringing up the more spiritual, the cult aspect of this New World Order scum.
[03:31:26.096 --> 03:31:29.939]  And that is by far the message that needs to be translated.
[03:31:30.019 --> 03:31:32.201]  Oh it is, and that was the tip of the iceberg.
[03:31:33.101 --> 03:31:35.663]  Me and Bill could have been on the phone for another six hours.
[03:31:35.723 --> 03:31:37.024]  No word of a lie, not exaggerating.
[03:31:37.344 --> 03:31:41.727]  We could have been on the phone for another six hours and not even touched the fabric of this.
[03:31:41.767 --> 03:31:44.049]  I mean, this is so in-depth and this needs to be covered.
[03:31:44.569 --> 03:31:49.673]  And people think it's a conspiracy, but this is... Okay, we're not, you know, going after the bank isn't going to solve nothing.
[03:31:49.693 --> 03:31:55.416]  Going after Mitt Romney or all these delegates and... You're going to go after the head of the snake.
[03:31:55.536 --> 03:31:57.718]  It's not the people, it's the evil on top.
[03:31:58.138 --> 03:31:58.859]  The evil on top.
[03:31:59.159 --> 03:32:00.360]  That's who you're going to go after.
[03:32:00.660 --> 03:32:01.520]  That's the enemy.
[03:32:02.001 --> 03:32:02.801]  Evil is the enemy.
[03:32:02.841 --> 03:32:05.583]  You know, you don't hate the puppets, you hate the evil that controls these puppets.
[03:32:05.603 --> 03:32:08.465]  Because these people are just mindless zombies and do what they're bidden.
[03:32:08.565 --> 03:32:10.486]  And, yeah, thank you for your call.
[03:32:10.546 --> 03:32:14.169]  And I'm sorry, Rich, I know I brought you on and I'm just over here ranting.
[03:32:15.750 --> 03:32:16.750]  Yeah, that's what you do.
[03:32:18.371 --> 03:32:20.431]  And what's your take on that, what he was talking about?
[03:32:21.292 --> 03:32:23.052]  Well, which, who he was talking about?
[03:32:23.072 --> 03:32:25.573]  Oh, it was Anthony from Wisconsin.
[03:32:26.194 --> 03:32:27.414]  Oh, the history major?
[03:32:27.554 --> 03:32:27.874]  Yeah.
[03:32:28.555 --> 03:32:35.717]  It's wonderful that, you know, people who actually are interested in history are also interested in, I guess, the real history.
[03:32:35.737 --> 03:32:37.838]  You know, the history that's not found in textbooks.
[03:32:39.159 --> 03:32:39.659]  It's important.
[03:32:40.339 --> 03:32:48.068]  It is, and I used to hate history, but when I got involved with the Truth Movement, they lied about George Washington in school.
[03:32:48.129 --> 03:32:49.510]  They lied about Thomas Jefferson.
[03:32:49.750 --> 03:32:51.453]  They lied about the founding of this nation.
[03:32:51.493 --> 03:32:54.656]  They lie about World War I. They lie about World War II.
[03:32:56.718 --> 03:33:16.846]  Just recently, I read a really great article on Lou Rockwell's website that basically showed Secretaries of War, or the Secretary of War, and people in political power during World War II, and all their statements based on whether or not Hiroshima and Nagasaki should have been bombed.
[03:33:17.426 --> 03:33:21.728]  And if you looked at it, I mean, I never was able to read this, they never taught this in high school,
[03:33:22.208 --> 03:33:30.552]  All the prominent politicians and even members of the military were like, we probably shouldn't need to bomb Japan.
[03:33:30.572 --> 03:33:32.293]  Japan surrendered months before.
[03:33:32.353 --> 03:33:33.213]  This is on record.
[03:33:33.233 --> 03:33:34.174]  Japan surrendered.
[03:33:34.474 --> 03:33:37.175]  So we surrender.
[03:33:37.215 --> 03:33:38.816]  Which is named the president.
[03:33:38.896 --> 03:33:39.917]  My memory's lost right now.
[03:33:40.337 --> 03:33:43.098]  He said, I'll let, I'll know when they surrender, whatever he said.
[03:33:43.138 --> 03:33:44.399]  He made a derogatory comment.
[03:33:44.419 --> 03:33:46.600]  We're going to bomb big boy, little boy, whatever.
[03:33:47.440 --> 03:33:49.702]  And it's just so much history just clogged in my head.
[03:33:49.822 --> 03:33:53.104]  Yeah, and it's not, that kind of history isn't really taught in school.
[03:33:53.344 --> 03:34:08.873]  So it's nice to see that someone who's, you know, someone's a history major and actually interested in legitimate history and, you know, can either make a difference either teaching, you know, high schools or college students or going out there and becoming some kind of, you know, political activist or whatever.
[03:34:08.973 --> 03:34:11.495]  It's good, you know, people are hungry for truth.
[03:34:12.236 --> 03:34:18.941]  There's only so much that someone can be lied to in terms of every institution from schools to media to churches.
[03:34:18.961 --> 03:34:23.724]  There's only so much people can put up with before their BS detector goes off.
[03:34:23.764 --> 03:34:27.747]  Bill was saying it's in plain sight.
[03:34:27.967 --> 03:34:29.188]  It's in plain sight, people.
[03:34:29.489 --> 03:34:31.870]  Just look, okay?
[03:34:31.990 --> 03:34:34.012]  Let me demonstrate this the best way, okay?
[03:34:34.032 --> 03:34:37.514]  When you're born, okay, they put these glasses on you.
[03:34:37.594 --> 03:34:39.095]  Anybody see the old 3D glasses?
[03:34:39.115 --> 03:34:41.197]  You have the red and the blue lens.
[03:34:41.357 --> 03:34:43.478]  Okay, that's where you get put over your head, okay?
[03:34:43.518 --> 03:34:45.119]  And this goes into politics, too.
[03:34:45.519 --> 03:34:46.879]  This goes into politics, too.
[03:34:46.919 --> 03:34:49.180]  You know, it's right and left, that's it.
[03:34:49.200 --> 03:34:54.442]  You're born with these glasses on, and you are, and you think it's the only thing that exists.
[03:34:54.482 --> 03:35:03.066]  But when you start piercing out of the box, you start peeking out of that little box you're in, all of a sudden the glasses come off, and wow, a whole new spectrum opens up to you.
[03:35:03.766 --> 03:35:08.428]  And you start seeing things that, wow, it's been here the whole time, and I just started noticing this.
[03:35:09.308 --> 03:35:11.189]  And it's not a conspiracy no more.
[03:35:11.209 --> 03:35:13.610]  I mean, I don't know how much to say about that, man.
[03:35:13.650 --> 03:35:16.331]  But I mean, people, you just gotta wake up and look for yourself.
[03:35:16.371 --> 03:35:17.111]  Don't listen to me.
[03:35:17.151 --> 03:35:18.331]  Don't listen to Alex Jones.
[03:35:18.752 --> 03:35:20.172]  Look for yourself, people.
[03:35:20.812 --> 03:35:21.433]  Bottom line.
[03:35:21.493 --> 03:35:23.293]  And it's out there in plain sight.
[03:35:24.294 --> 03:35:27.115]  Man, and let's go to Fred from Minnesota.
[03:35:27.155 --> 03:35:27.775]  How you doing, Fred?
[03:35:30.896 --> 03:35:32.357]  Hey, how you doing, man?
[03:35:33.078 --> 03:35:33.939]  Oh, real great.
[03:35:34.019 --> 03:35:37.603]  Hey, Dan, you're doing a fabulous job.
[03:35:38.063 --> 03:35:38.584]  Thanks, man.
[03:35:38.844 --> 03:35:46.171]  It's got some new talent and everything, and I like the way the show is making a turn.
[03:35:46.772 --> 03:35:48.654]  But I wanted to talk to Bill, but...
[03:35:50.123 --> 03:35:50.983]  I couldn't get on.
[03:35:51.003 --> 03:35:55.287]  I'm sorry to hear... I wish we had more time for Bill, man.
[03:35:55.367 --> 03:35:57.869]  I mean, we could have went on all night with Bill.
[03:35:58.650 --> 03:36:04.115]  I would like to talk to Bill for about three days straight, and I'd like to talk to you for about three days straight.
[03:36:04.155 --> 03:36:10.481]  Well, his website... Anyhow, I'm 75 years old, and I put in cell phone on the computer and the internet and all that.
[03:36:10.521 --> 03:36:11.241]  I'm not a nerd.
[03:36:11.702 --> 03:36:14.064]  I put in 5,000 hours of research.
[03:36:14.304 --> 03:36:14.945]  God bless you.
[03:36:15.586 --> 03:36:21.810]  Okay, now, if I may, I would like to give you one website and then I'll get off the air.
[03:36:22.050 --> 03:36:23.591]  Oh, go right ahead, man.
[03:36:23.611 --> 03:36:25.352]  Thank you for calling and staying up this late.
[03:36:25.413 --> 03:36:25.933]  God bless you.
[03:36:26.873 --> 03:36:31.076]  Okay, AmazingDiscoveries.org.
[03:36:31.096 --> 03:36:33.878]  AmazingDiscoveries.org?
[03:36:34.519 --> 03:36:39.482]  Yeah, and you're a researcher and you're a talk show host and all that, and I know you're busy as hell.
[03:36:39.882 --> 03:36:41.203]  You do a lot of research.
[03:36:41.755 --> 03:36:43.155]  But go all over the web.
[03:36:43.195 --> 03:36:45.056]  Well, I mean, over his web.
[03:36:45.316 --> 03:36:47.617]  Because I think I know where you're coming from.
[03:36:48.057 --> 03:36:48.557]  Oh, thank you.
[03:36:48.577 --> 03:36:48.977]  God bless you.
[03:36:48.997 --> 03:36:50.138]  You're doing a great job.
[03:36:50.198 --> 03:36:51.458]  I want to see more of you.
[03:36:51.778 --> 03:36:52.558]  And Fred, thank you.
[03:36:52.638 --> 03:36:55.920]  And I promise you, I will go to that website when I get off the air here.
[03:36:56.000 --> 03:36:57.520]  AmazingDiscovery.org.
[03:36:57.560 --> 03:36:58.600]  I read it down, actually.
[03:36:59.041 --> 03:37:01.261]  And if you can see it, if you're watching PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:37:01.321 --> 03:37:02.962]  And thank you for your support.
[03:37:03.082 --> 03:37:04.182]  And God bless you, man.
[03:37:04.202 --> 03:37:06.043]  75 more years to come, too, brother.
[03:37:06.083 --> 03:37:06.583]  God bless you.
[03:37:07.728 --> 03:37:09.689]  God bless you, bye bye.
[03:37:09.729 --> 03:37:13.070]  Let's go to Denon in California.
[03:37:13.090 --> 03:37:16.532]  Hi Denon, you there?
[03:37:17.232 --> 03:37:17.532]  Hello.
[03:37:17.832 --> 03:37:18.573]  Hey, how you doing man?
[03:37:19.253 --> 03:37:19.913]  Good, how are you?
[03:37:20.193 --> 03:37:21.274]  Calling from the West Coast.
[03:37:21.294 --> 03:37:23.055]  You're staying up late man.
[03:37:23.115 --> 03:37:25.296]  It's, what is it, 2.30 over there?
[03:37:25.316 --> 03:37:25.296]  2.39?
[03:37:25.916 --> 03:37:26.236]  Yeah, 2.40.
[03:37:26.356 --> 03:37:30.798]  I've been with you guys all but two hours today.
[03:37:30.958 --> 03:37:31.978]  So addicted.
[03:37:32.519 --> 03:37:32.919]  Oh wow.
[03:37:33.720 --> 03:37:40.466]  But yeah, I actually just wanted to call and make a couple points and ask one question that either you or Richard could answer.
[03:37:40.486 --> 03:37:41.367]  Oh, sure.
[03:37:41.647 --> 03:37:53.599]  One, I think it's important for me to note that I'm 24 years old, an African American male in Hollywood, as an aspiring filmmaker, and I've been away for probably about like five months.
[03:37:54.440 --> 03:37:59.045]  Um, and it's just, it's absolutely ridiculous that everything is just, like, right in front of us.
[03:37:59.426 --> 03:38:02.649]  And especially being in Hollywood, I just didn't even realize it.
[03:38:03.070 --> 03:38:07.155]  You know, just, it's like walking around just, like, in a constant state of just, like, daze.
[03:38:07.905 --> 03:38:23.240]  And I woke up because I realized that pretty much as you guys were just talking about it was just like you were born and then you just like you're kind of micromanaged in a way and even your parents are kind of micromanaged and then like they go from the things that they're taught.
[03:38:23.520 --> 03:38:27.104]  But I just remember growing up and there's all these questions that were never answered.
[03:38:27.646 --> 03:38:35.328]  And I started getting really deep into the Holocaust, and I wanted to start making films about the Holocaust, but pretty much, there were so many questions that were just not answered.
[03:38:35.848 --> 03:38:37.149]  And I just could not understand.
[03:38:37.209 --> 03:38:41.970]  So finally, I turned to what everybody deemed as the crazy people, which were the conspiracy theorists.
[03:38:42.690 --> 03:38:51.433]  And, you know, and I realized that after just studying, like, you know, the Fritz Sprengmeier's and the, you know, the past of Lindsay Williams, and then all of a sudden coming up on Alex Jones,
[03:38:51.853 --> 03:38:53.254]  I was just like, boom, this is it!
[03:38:53.654 --> 03:39:06.900]  Now, for me, now that I've unlocked that, I'm having a hard time even going to my parents to kind of wake them up, and I've talked to them, tried to talk to them about the QE3.
[03:39:07.480 --> 03:39:09.741]  I've done a lot of research.
[03:39:09.981 --> 03:39:15.804]  I've been doing this for about six months, just dedicating, stopping everything else that I was doing, and kind of just doing this.
[03:39:16.384 --> 03:39:26.768]  And, you know, it is frightening because we do need to become prepared, and I know that everybody that's called in before, um, and all the people that you guys have had on, it's not a matter of if it happens, it's just when.
[03:39:27.208 --> 03:39:38.372]  And so, I was just wondering if you guys had any advice on about how to go to, you know, the older, you know, the older people, even when you have knowledge, even when you are sitting there going, like, you guys know about FEMA camps?
[03:39:38.392 --> 03:39:38.972]  And they're like, no.
[03:39:39.012 --> 03:39:41.073]  And then you show them documents about FEMA camps.
[03:39:41.733 --> 03:39:47.815]  You know, showing them videos that they're still in this state, and it's just like, it can't possibly be real.
[03:39:47.835 --> 03:39:50.816]  Like, the United States of America just doesn't do that kind of evil.
[03:39:51.156 --> 03:39:55.238]  And I always say, like, well, if you're a Christian, then you know that this kind of evil exists.
[03:39:56.145 --> 03:39:56.526]  Absolutely.
[03:39:56.606 --> 03:40:09.696]  The thing is, again, what I was talking about earlier, the churches, and Rich, if you want to answer the question, the churches condition you, the 501c3 churches condition you to, you know, stay in your pews.
[03:40:09.716 --> 03:40:13.499]  Don't, you know, Ned Flanders on The Simpsons, anybody knows who he is, you know what I mean?
[03:40:13.519 --> 03:40:15.800]  Stay in your little pews and just keep your mouth shut.
[03:40:15.840 --> 03:40:18.202]  No, don't, don't, don't bother with evil.
[03:40:18.282 --> 03:40:22.926]  When Jesus says the opposite, you're supposed to be in the midst of evil, bringing light and truth to the world.
[03:40:23.146 --> 03:40:25.747]  Not sitting in your pews being little Ned Flanders Christians.
[03:40:26.127 --> 03:40:28.969]  You know, you're supposed to know your enemy and expose them.
[03:40:29.409 --> 03:40:30.009]  Bottom line.
[03:40:30.049 --> 03:40:31.830]  And we're not going to be magically beamed up.
[03:40:32.210 --> 03:40:37.152]  You know, I mean, it's just so much stuff that the mainstream churches are teaching the schools and everything else.
[03:40:37.432 --> 03:40:40.114]  They want to zombify the population.
[03:40:40.174 --> 03:40:40.674]  Bottom line.
[03:40:40.714 --> 03:40:42.875]  And you got that question for Richard?
[03:40:43.795 --> 03:40:44.095]  Yeah.
[03:40:44.115 --> 03:40:50.878]  I was just wondering, you know, do you have any, um, do you have any like, um, uh, I was trying to think of the word.
[03:40:50.918 --> 03:40:51.959]  Do you have any, like, uh,
[03:40:58.291 --> 03:41:13.520]  ...go into, like, as far as even, like, the Illuminati and esoteric knowledge and stuff like that, but just as far as economics, as far as, you know, getting prepared, because, you know, I do know that what Patchouli's Illuminati came out last week, or I believe the week before, and talked about in six to eight months, your dollar is done.
[03:41:13.540 --> 03:41:15.261]  The money that you have in your bank account is gone.
[03:41:15.595 --> 03:41:19.577]  You know, and personally, I don't want to see my parents drug off into FEMA camps.
[03:41:19.597 --> 03:41:20.718]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:41:20.778 --> 03:41:21.718]  Nobody wants to see that.
[03:41:21.758 --> 03:41:27.622]  And that's what we're trying to do right now, is, you know, waking people up like yourself and all that.
[03:41:28.162 --> 03:41:36.306]  And, you know, the money bomb, and I know it's not all about money, but we need the money to push this information out worldwide, because we're exploding here in InfoWise.
[03:41:36.326 --> 03:41:37.127]  We're exploding.
[03:41:37.567 --> 03:41:39.028]  And we're loading this ship up right now.
[03:41:39.128 --> 03:41:44.751]  And Rob Dew is telling me this terminology, you know, people don't think the ship's moving right now.
[03:41:45.211 --> 03:41:46.172]  All it is is loading.
[03:41:46.332 --> 03:41:46.432]  Okay?
[03:41:46.472 --> 03:41:47.873]  And this is a warning to the New World Order.
[03:41:48.174 --> 03:41:49.455]  We're loading that ship, brother.
[03:41:49.695 --> 03:41:52.437]  And when that ship gets loaded, we're coming full steam right at you.
[03:41:52.457 --> 03:41:53.718]  And that's why we need your support.
[03:41:54.259 --> 03:41:55.580]  And Rich, you want to answer that for him?
[03:41:56.240 --> 03:42:01.585]  Yeah, actually that's a very common issue.
[03:42:01.645 --> 03:42:03.867]  Something that's actually close and near and dear to my heart.
[03:42:05.496 --> 03:42:12.958]  Waking up, so to speak, people in your own family who are older is very challenging because of the normalcy bias.
[03:42:13.919 --> 03:42:24.402]  You know, if you're around the same age as I am, people who are older than you, like your parents, they lived in an era where the economic situation was much better, obviously.
[03:42:24.422 --> 03:42:27.203]  You know, things always got better.
[03:42:27.943 --> 03:42:31.384]  They never thought that they would ever see what we're talking about.
[03:42:32.724 --> 03:42:34.685]  My best advice, the way that I can
[03:42:35.945 --> 03:42:57.438]  Give you advice if I can about this is Don't be very excited Excitable when you talk about this kind of stuff Show it inch by inch small amounts incremental eyes when it comes to what kind of information you're giving and if you Don't think they're going to prepare for themselves.
[03:42:57.458 --> 03:42:58.819]  I mean they're your parents and
[03:42:58.979 --> 03:43:00.239]  Prepare for them, you know?
[03:43:00.439 --> 03:43:05.401]  I mean, if you have money and you're storing food, do it yourself and put some extra for your family.
[03:43:05.821 --> 03:43:15.684]  If you're putting some money into, you know, silver bullion or whatever, put some of your own and get a little bit extra stash in case something happens to you and your family.
[03:43:15.904 --> 03:43:17.065]  Because we know it's going to happen.
[03:43:17.565 --> 03:43:24.667]  And parents don't want to typically listen to their children when they're giving them advice on economic issues for obvious reasons.
[03:43:24.667 --> 03:43:27.848]  You know, they don't want to listen to their kids about it.
[03:43:27.888 --> 03:43:29.128]  Yeah, the father's giving it away.
[03:43:29.468 --> 03:43:34.909]  And people, if you want to invest in gold and silver, I mean, we've got a great sponsor here, MidasResources.com.
[03:43:35.529 --> 03:43:43.871]  I mean, we had Ted Anderson on here a thousand times, and everything he said, with the price of gold going up, everything else, he's been right on target every time, folks.
[03:43:44.251 --> 03:43:45.572]  MidasResources.com.
[03:43:45.612 --> 03:43:49.212]  If you can predict your... I'll give you an example.
[03:43:49.413 --> 03:43:49.993]  My father is...
[03:43:52.273 --> 03:43:53.334]  He knows a lot about money.
[03:43:53.354 --> 03:43:54.755]  He knows a lot about economics.
[03:43:54.776 --> 03:43:57.418]  But one thing he constantly said, he's like, they'll never do a QE2.
[03:43:57.458 --> 03:43:58.479]  They'll never do a QE2.
[03:43:58.759 --> 03:44:01.041]  And I told him, flat out, they're going to do QE2.
[03:44:01.362 --> 03:44:03.263]  And what did they do a few years later, or a few months later?
[03:44:03.524 --> 03:44:04.264]  They did QE2.
[03:44:04.565 --> 03:44:07.287]  And when that happens, I told him, they're going to do QE3.
[03:44:07.307 --> 03:44:08.709]  Because, you know, I'm just like you.
[03:44:08.989 --> 03:44:10.090]  We read this stuff, we're like, oh.
[03:44:10.150 --> 03:44:10.971]  Oh yeah, no, no, no, no.
[03:44:11.451 --> 03:44:12.332]  No, no, no.
[03:44:12.552 --> 03:44:14.914]  They'll never, they'll never put us in camps.
[03:44:14.934 --> 03:44:16.995]  They'll never take us over.
[03:44:17.015 --> 03:44:18.156]  Hitler would never do that.
[03:44:18.176 --> 03:44:20.518]  And, you know, the Polish people, what could happen to them?
[03:44:20.558 --> 03:44:21.619]  That would never happen to us.
[03:44:21.699 --> 03:44:22.039]  Bam!
[03:44:22.059 --> 03:44:23.701]  The German citizens, that would never happen to us.
[03:44:23.761 --> 03:44:24.081]  Bam!
[03:44:24.101 --> 03:44:26.403]  Americans all, oh yeah, that would never happen.
[03:44:26.423 --> 03:44:27.124]  Yeah, well, you know what?
[03:44:27.184 --> 03:44:27.984]  It's happening now.
[03:44:28.324 --> 03:44:30.486]  And let's go to Mike from Texas, FEMA Region 6.
[03:44:30.786 --> 03:44:31.287]  How you doing, man?
[03:44:32.887 --> 03:44:35.229]  Hey, great show tonight, Dan.
[03:44:35.249 --> 03:44:36.791]  I really speak with passion.
[03:44:36.871 --> 03:44:39.213]  Good to have Rich on.
[03:44:39.293 --> 03:44:40.094]  Passion, baby!
[03:44:40.134 --> 03:44:41.355]  That's what we're all about, man.
[03:44:41.395 --> 03:44:42.076]  Go ahead, Mike.
[03:44:42.176 --> 03:44:43.357]  I'm sorry.
[03:44:43.377 --> 03:44:44.959]  So, a quick question.
[03:44:45.019 --> 03:44:46.620]  We're all kind of in the same age group.
[03:44:47.021 --> 03:44:48.182]  I'm right here in Texas.
[03:44:48.242 --> 03:44:56.090]  The question really comes down to something that we haven't really talked a lot about, and that's kind of the whole cyberterrorism and the whole movement.
[03:44:57.151 --> 03:45:03.116]  What do y'alls take on what Cybercrime is doing, zombifying, the entire thing?
[03:45:03.176 --> 03:45:20.112]  I mean, we've got a report that 60 Minutes put out last weekend that was all about Huawei, which is a Chinese telecom provider, bringing out and supplying the telecom providers in the United States with cheap product.
[03:45:20.712 --> 03:45:22.073]  Well, where do you guys see that going?
[03:45:22.093 --> 03:45:23.655]  Do you guys see anything with that?
[03:45:23.695 --> 03:45:25.756]  Is this the new sign of terror?
[03:45:25.877 --> 03:45:27.778]  It's kind of unavoidable.
[03:45:28.018 --> 03:45:29.640]  You talking about the cyber attacks and all that?
[03:45:31.256 --> 03:45:32.236]  Yeah, well it is.
[03:45:32.557 --> 03:45:37.721]  It's a false flag because they know they can't take the internet away from us right now.
[03:45:38.041 --> 03:45:39.582]  And they're going to use everything in the book.
[03:45:39.762 --> 03:45:46.607]  I mean, if you go to those websites there for the download music, Morpheus and all that.
[03:45:46.627 --> 03:45:51.151]  If you go to them, it has a FBI one and all that, whatever, because they want a sense of the internet.
[03:45:51.311 --> 03:45:57.596]  They're going after websites, and I'm sure they're trying to shut us down too, but they know they can't right now because we've got too many followers.
[03:45:58.296 --> 03:46:01.159]  And Rich, I'll give you a take in a second.
[03:46:01.439 --> 03:46:02.920]  The thing is, they want to shut us down.
[03:46:02.960 --> 03:46:07.664]  They don't want you to have the power to go out and gain this great knowledge that's out there.
[03:46:07.764 --> 03:46:09.325]  And Rich, what's your take on that?
[03:46:10.458 --> 03:46:11.439]  Well, yeah.
[03:46:11.599 --> 03:46:13.560]  I mean, that's really what it boils down to.
[03:46:13.600 --> 03:46:18.743]  First, they come for the people that they think that they have, you know, the public support for.
[03:46:18.843 --> 03:46:23.445]  So the file sharing, they're like, well, you're breaking copyright law, so we're going to come after you guys.
[03:46:24.246 --> 03:46:27.848]  And then they'll, like the Stuxnet worm, I mean, we know that the West
[03:46:28.408 --> 03:46:34.192]  In Israel, they admitted that they created this weapon of cyber, you know, it's a cyber weapon.
[03:46:34.332 --> 03:46:42.158]  They created it, and then they used it, and then they say we need to take away your right from the internet to protect you from the weapons that we're creating.
[03:46:42.378 --> 03:46:45.581]  So we're already seeing instances of cyber attacks.
[03:46:46.581 --> 03:46:52.085]  And, I mean, the only way that you can prevent it from actually being able to take over our internet is by exposing it.
[03:46:52.606 --> 03:46:53.206]  Exactly.
[03:46:53.306 --> 03:46:55.568]  And is that answering your question, Mike?
[03:46:56.325 --> 03:46:56.765]  Yeah, it does.
[03:46:57.185 --> 03:46:57.625]  Awesome, man.
[03:46:57.665 --> 03:46:58.625]  Thank you for calling, man.
[03:46:58.685 --> 03:47:02.946]  And thank you for staying up this late and listening to me run my mouth off over here.
[03:47:02.966 --> 03:47:04.166]  Thank you for your support, man.
[03:47:04.226 --> 03:47:05.166]  And God bless you.
[03:47:06.107 --> 03:47:07.487]  Hey, God bless you guys, too.
[03:47:07.507 --> 03:47:08.127]  Great show tonight.
[03:47:08.367 --> 03:47:08.747]  Thank you.
[03:47:08.947 --> 03:47:11.348]  And Josh from Wisconsin, how you doing, man?
[03:47:12.668 --> 03:47:13.608]  Hey there, I'm pretty good.
[03:47:13.648 --> 03:47:14.288]  How about yourself?
[03:47:14.608 --> 03:47:15.128]  Oh, great.
[03:47:15.168 --> 03:47:17.028]  Yeah, just feeling the power you have.
[03:47:17.429 --> 03:47:18.669]  Liberty moving forward, man.
[03:47:18.729 --> 03:47:20.449]  I'm just excited to be part of this.
[03:47:20.469 --> 03:47:21.429]  Yeah, I'm right on.
[03:47:22.189 --> 03:47:25.570]  And it's such a pleasure to be on stream here.
[03:47:26.991 --> 03:47:27.992]  Well, you're live right now.
[03:47:28.072 --> 03:47:34.695]  You're live in front of millions of people on Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, InfowarsMoneyBomb.com.
[03:47:35.115 --> 03:47:36.296]  So, what's your question, brother?
[03:47:37.156 --> 03:47:37.536]  Right on.
[03:47:37.576 --> 03:47:46.961]  Well, I just want to let you guys know, you know, I'm about as awake as, you know, a morning of going out and hunting for some deer in the morning, like, right now.
[03:47:49.611 --> 03:47:51.052]  Oh, go ahead, get some good venison.
[03:47:51.172 --> 03:47:53.613]  Oh, no, don't do that because you're supposed to eat the GMOs.
[03:47:53.954 --> 03:47:54.694]  You know, don't buy the 100.
[03:47:54.734 --> 03:47:57.596]  You're supposed to eat those GMOs.
[03:47:57.656 --> 03:48:03.279]  We're supposed to be induced with all this and think, you know, it's all good and good and dandy, you know.
[03:48:04.140 --> 03:48:07.321]  All right, well, what's your question for Richard?
[03:48:08.402 --> 03:48:10.844]  Well, not so much a question.
[03:48:12.239 --> 03:48:18.764]  It's more of where I live right now and how big of a scare it is to me.
[03:48:19.385 --> 03:48:20.625]  I'm 20 years old.
[03:48:20.646 --> 03:48:24.228]  I have a four-year-old son.
[03:48:24.889 --> 03:48:30.833]  I've woken up real quick the last past month here.
[03:48:31.854 --> 03:48:33.836]  I'm from Wisconsin.
[03:48:34.316 --> 03:48:39.480]  I happen to be born and raised in the town called Oshkosh.
[03:48:43.505 --> 03:48:57.183]  We pretty much manufacture, you know, the biggest military vehicles that, you know, that are being, you know, sent overseas and, you know, to places where we really don't belong.
[03:49:00.049 --> 03:49:03.511]  Yeah, the thing is, again, they want you to be scared.
[03:49:04.471 --> 03:49:07.592]  I got a newborn, so he's going to be one year old next week.
[03:49:08.013 --> 03:49:09.213]  They want you to be afraid.
[03:49:09.413 --> 03:49:13.155]  And people are telling me, why do you have a son with all this stuff that's going on?
[03:49:13.215 --> 03:49:14.896]  You know, the thing is, you can't give in.
[03:49:15.196 --> 03:49:16.156]  You can't give in.
[03:49:16.636 --> 03:49:20.258]  And you've got to be strong, you know what I mean?
[03:49:20.278 --> 03:49:22.159]  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[03:49:22.259 --> 03:49:22.959]  Oh, that's fine.
[03:49:23.099 --> 03:49:24.239]  I'm just sick.
[03:49:24.620 --> 03:49:27.761]  I'm just sick behind my guts, you know, with what's going on.
[03:49:29.045 --> 03:49:31.967]  And that's good, because the thing is, like that movie Network.
[03:49:32.147 --> 03:49:33.988]  You know, you've seen that movie, Network?
[03:49:34.368 --> 03:49:35.909]  And he says, you've got to get mad.
[03:49:36.369 --> 03:49:36.710]  You do.
[03:49:36.750 --> 03:49:38.711]  You've got to get mad first before anything.
[03:49:38.771 --> 03:49:42.553]  And I'm not saying going on a shooting spree or nothing, but you need to get mad.
[03:49:42.993 --> 03:49:44.154]  Then go out and inform people.
[03:49:44.174 --> 03:49:48.637]  Say, hey, smack them in the face with truth and say, hey, listen, we're under attack right now.
[03:49:48.777 --> 03:49:51.959]  We're in big trouble, folks, and this is what you need to do.
[03:49:52.899 --> 03:49:55.261]  Right on, you know, and I just, you know, I just, you know, I got
[03:50:16.857 --> 03:50:17.177]  Yeah, I'm good.
[03:50:35.307 --> 03:50:45.315]  Me and my co-workers, you know, we shoot the shit every day at work about how, you know, corrupted this world is and what, what, what wants to be, you know, what, what they demand.
[03:50:45.535 --> 03:50:50.299]  Well, you can't, I mean, uh, you, uh, Alex, I know you hate some praise and all that, but you can't say enough about the guy.
[03:50:50.319 --> 03:50:51.660]  The guy brings so much energy.
[03:50:51.700 --> 03:50:53.942]  When he walks in this building, it's just, like,
[03:50:54.622 --> 03:50:56.923]  It's opened up a vault of energy, just BAM!
[03:50:56.983 --> 03:50:57.324]  BAM!
[03:50:57.364 --> 03:50:59.945]  You know, zapping people, and you come alive, you know what I mean?
[03:50:59.965 --> 03:51:01.366]  And uh, thank you if you called, Josh.
[03:51:01.986 --> 03:51:04.948]  And uh, Joshua, you, I'm sorry, Joshua from New York.
[03:51:04.968 --> 03:51:05.548]  How you doing, man?
[03:51:05.568 --> 03:51:06.949]  Hey.
[03:51:08.150 --> 03:51:09.711]  From Fremont Region 2, I believe.
[03:51:09.811 --> 03:51:10.811]  Uh, how you doing, brother?
[03:51:10.831 --> 03:51:13.273]  Uh, I'm doing alright.
[03:51:13.433 --> 03:51:16.274]  Um, I actually have a lot to say.
[03:51:16.294 --> 03:51:20.997]  Um, I want to talk about the uh, the particular differences between um,
[03:51:22.337 --> 03:51:23.238]  I don't know.
[03:51:44.048 --> 03:51:44.488]  We're good.
[03:52:07.333 --> 03:52:17.017]  You know, you had the thing in Benghazi, and then the second debate, then you have this thing, you know, the Federal Reserve Building in New York, this, you know, this FBI-contrived thing.
[03:52:17.617 --> 03:52:18.658]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:52:18.838 --> 03:52:22.919]  It's ridiculous how overt the criminality is of these people.
[03:52:23.580 --> 03:52:26.241]  One more thing I wanted to get across was
[03:52:27.230 --> 03:52:33.015]  Look at the ownership of the largest containers of wealth within the personal sector.
[03:52:33.395 --> 03:52:40.120]  You look at cars being one of the largest ones, and your homes being the biggest one, as well as healthcare.
[03:52:40.741 --> 03:52:52.730]  And look at how Obama bailed out these banks, and how we don't actually own our homes, how a lot of people don't actually own their cars, how people are feeding money into a healthcare system which isn't
[03:52:53.445 --> 03:52:55.685]  You see what I'm saying?
[03:52:55.725 --> 03:53:03.227]  There's a perfect, perfectly set up format for this cuss fight.
[03:53:03.287 --> 03:53:05.447]  It is so clear to see how this is lining up.
[03:53:05.567 --> 03:53:05.827]  Perfect.
[03:53:05.847 --> 03:53:06.267]  Oh, it is.
[03:53:07.007 --> 03:53:08.928]  I mean, I hear exactly what you're saying, man.
[03:53:08.968 --> 03:53:12.208]  And Rich, I want to give you a take on that because we're going to be running out of time.
[03:53:12.228 --> 03:53:13.428]  We've got like five minutes left.
[03:53:13.489 --> 03:53:15.389]  And Joshua, thank you for your call.
[03:53:15.409 --> 03:53:16.549]  I wish I had more time for you.
[03:53:16.569 --> 03:53:18.689]  We've got a few more calls I want to try to squeeze in.
[03:53:18.769 --> 03:53:21.730]  And real quick, Rich, what do you think about that?
[03:53:22.987 --> 03:53:25.789]  Well, I mean, it's just... What is there to say?
[03:53:25.809 --> 03:53:30.291]  I mean, you're lost for words because you know this stuff is happening.
[03:53:30.311 --> 03:53:34.174]  He mentioned the over-obviousness.
[03:53:34.694 --> 03:53:36.295]  I just want to make a point on that.
[03:53:36.395 --> 03:53:37.416]  It's obvious to us.
[03:53:37.956 --> 03:53:43.940]  It's obvious to us when you see the FBI give the bomb to someone and then foil their own plot.
[03:53:44.640 --> 03:53:57.445]  But the majority of the people aren't reading Infowars.com, they're not going to RealityZone.com, they're not reading things that Gerald Cilente, or Tom Woods, or GM Griffin, or Paul Krugrober, they're not reading these guys.
[03:53:57.705 --> 03:54:03.647]  They're watching Fox, they're watching CNN, and CNN and Fox don't say the FBI foiled their own plot.
[03:54:04.107 --> 03:54:09.269]  CNN and Fox report terrorist suspect at the Federal Reserve has been detained.
[03:54:09.989 --> 03:54:15.339]  And so, really what it boils down to is the fact that we need to expose the truth.
[03:54:15.399 --> 03:54:18.946]  And we need to tell people, yeah, we need to point out that the emperor's got no clothes.
[03:54:19.026 --> 03:54:20.148]  That's really what it boils down to.
[03:54:20.848 --> 03:54:33.090]  Absolutely, you know, yeah, yeah, I mean, I had the manual right here, the Army Field Manual, basically saying that if you, the Field Manual, Army Field Manual, to say, if you disagree with mainstream media, you're a terrorist.
[03:54:33.670 --> 03:54:40.151]  But I'm not going to go down that road right now, because I'll get into a rant, we don't have much time, and we got Randy from Michigan.
[03:54:40.311 --> 03:54:41.392]  Randy, how you doing, brother?
[03:54:42.732 --> 03:54:44.032]  Hey, how's it going?
[03:54:44.272 --> 03:54:45.632]  Oh, great, feeling great.
[03:54:45.652 --> 03:54:48.513]  It's almost 5 o'clock in the morning, we're still rocking here, info-wise.
[03:54:49.369 --> 03:54:51.930]  Hey, it's 6 o'clock in the morning here.
[03:54:51.950 --> 03:54:57.072]  My mom and dad live down there in Texas.
[03:54:57.212 --> 03:54:58.613]  I gotta mute my music.
[03:54:58.713 --> 03:55:03.235]  I'm listening to some Type O Negative while I was waiting to see if my call came through.
[03:55:04.216 --> 03:55:07.337]  Man, I tried a hundred times to get through and finally did.
[03:55:08.145 --> 03:55:12.087]  Yeah, I mean we got flooded phone lines and I apologize to everybody that's waiting.
[03:55:12.107 --> 03:55:13.928]  We got a Syrian girl coming up next.
[03:55:13.948 --> 03:55:17.769]  Hey, I got a few things I'd like to talk about.
[03:55:17.829 --> 03:55:18.009]  Yep.
[03:55:18.410 --> 03:55:22.791]  And if I have to go to a commercial, I'll hold through the commercial and keep on there.
[03:55:22.811 --> 03:55:31.975]  My segment ends in like 2-3 minutes so if you want to just like, I'm on again tomorrow night so if you want to call, if you want to call again tomorrow night.
[03:55:32.796 --> 03:55:34.376]  I can try to be quick about it.
[03:55:34.396 --> 03:55:34.956]  Oh sure, go ahead.
[03:55:36.989 --> 03:55:42.091]  It's an honor, first of all, to be able to talk to anybody that's involved with InfoWars.
[03:55:42.532 --> 03:55:42.972]  Thank you.
[03:55:45.033 --> 03:55:47.314]  Second of all, I live in Flint, Michigan.
[03:55:49.195 --> 03:55:54.417]  Here in Flint, Michigan, it is insanely crazy.
[03:55:54.557 --> 03:56:05.142]  Like, there's people that get the wrong order at, like, a rallies, which in some states is known as a checkers, and they literally, like, shoot
[03:56:05.876 --> 03:56:09.485]  They're guns through the drive-thru window because of their bad order.
[03:56:09.505 --> 03:56:10.969]  Unbelievable.
[03:56:11.029 --> 03:56:14.216]  We have a higher crime rate in Flint than Detroit does.
[03:56:15.273 --> 03:56:15.533]  Wow.
[03:56:15.853 --> 03:56:21.675]  Well, remember the Detroit, uh, the article that came out, the police are warning people, you know, enter at your own risk.
[03:56:22.095 --> 03:56:24.936]  And the polls show that 80% of Americans are afraid to go to Detroit now.
[03:56:25.376 --> 03:56:27.957]  But yeah, I mean, it's crazy.
[03:56:28.197 --> 03:56:29.918]  Do you have internet in front of you right now?
[03:56:30.238 --> 03:56:31.858]  Uh, yes I do, but I don't have time, brother.
[03:56:31.878 --> 03:56:34.279]  I got like a minute and a half on the show here.
[03:56:34.679 --> 03:56:36.240]  And please call back tomorrow night, man.
[03:56:36.900 --> 03:56:39.883]  I'm sorry, I gotta cut you off because we gotta get going, man.
[03:56:39.923 --> 03:56:45.247]  But call back tomorrow night and tell the screener that I told you to call back and you'll get back on.
[03:56:45.287 --> 03:56:46.628]  I'll be on at 1 o'clock in the morning.
[03:56:46.848 --> 03:56:48.149]  That'll be 12 o'clock airtime.
[03:56:48.169 --> 03:56:50.571]  I promise I'll get you on tomorrow, right?
[03:56:52.173 --> 03:56:54.414]  So thank you, Randy, and yeah, call back tomorrow.
[03:56:54.474 --> 03:56:55.916]  So we got a little minute left.
[03:56:55.976 --> 03:57:01.000]  And Rich, final take, just general of what we've been talking about tonight.
[03:57:02.668 --> 03:57:06.834]  In general, we all know that something bad is going to happen.
[03:57:07.094 --> 03:57:11.721]  We know there's going to be some kind of event, whether it's an economic event, another war.
[03:57:11.741 --> 03:57:14.685]  History shows that it's going to repeat itself.
[03:57:16.308 --> 03:57:17.590]  The only thing you can do is prepare.
[03:57:18.050 --> 03:57:22.713]  The only thing you can do is speak out, tell people, expose the situation.
[03:57:22.773 --> 03:57:25.215]  But exposing the situation isn't going to stop these people.
[03:57:25.255 --> 03:57:26.456]  These people are crazy.
[03:57:26.996 --> 03:57:28.357]  These people are sociopaths.
[03:57:28.417 --> 03:57:35.661]  One of my favorite articles that I read the other day was, America tunes in to see which sociopath they like more, regarding the debate.
[03:57:35.681 --> 03:57:37.863]  I mean, things are going to get bad.
[03:57:37.963 --> 03:57:38.663]  Oh, yeah.
[03:57:39.224 --> 03:57:40.925]  And the only thing that you can do is prepare.
[03:57:41.445 --> 03:57:41.926]  Exactly.
[03:57:41.946 --> 03:57:43.687]  And I want to talk about that.
[03:57:44.107 --> 03:57:46.048]  We got like probably 30 seconds left, whatever.
[03:57:47.549 --> 03:57:49.390]  Well, Rich, I want to thank you for us for coming on.
[03:57:49.490 --> 03:57:51.131]  I want to have you back on tomorrow night, man.
[03:57:51.471 --> 03:57:57.775]  Tomorrow night, I want you back on, man, because I'm sorry I didn't give you enough time, whatever, but I just want to touch this before you go.
[03:57:57.815 --> 03:57:59.176]  The right-wing, left-wing paradigm.
[03:57:59.216 --> 03:58:03.138]  People, I talk to people all the time, well, we're going to go for the lesser of two evils, okay?
[03:58:03.478 --> 03:58:04.879]  Evil is evil, people.
[03:58:04.959 --> 03:58:08.501]  I got family and friends right now who are going for Obama, some for Romney.
[03:58:08.801 --> 03:58:10.062]  Oh, he's the lesser of two evils.
[03:58:10.402 --> 03:58:12.283]  I don't care if you're family and friends or not, you're an idiot.
[03:58:12.503 --> 03:58:18.004]  Bottom line, because if you can't see, okay, Romney laid the blueprint for Obamacare.
[03:58:19.205 --> 03:58:20.665]  Unbelievable, and you can't see that?
[03:58:21.005 --> 03:58:22.786]  I lived in Massachusetts for four years.
[03:58:23.226 --> 03:58:27.707]  I had to pay $200 a month on my taxes if I didn't have health care.
[03:58:28.247 --> 03:58:31.508]  That's $2,400 off your taxes if you didn't have health care.
[03:58:31.988 --> 03:58:33.369]  And you call that great?
[03:58:33.969 --> 03:58:35.670]  Okay, that's what Obamacare's gonna be like, too.
[03:58:35.770 --> 03:58:36.650]  It's the same damn thing.
[03:58:37.850 --> 03:58:38.811]  Well, we're running out of time.
[03:58:38.831 --> 03:58:41.432]  We've got the Obamaphone girl coming on.
[03:58:41.753 --> 03:58:43.234]  But please, join me tomorrow night.
[03:58:43.274 --> 03:58:44.455]  But stay on all night if you can.
[03:58:44.495 --> 03:58:45.355]  Join me tomorrow night.
[03:58:45.415 --> 03:58:48.117]  I'll be on at 1 o'clock Central for four hours.
[03:58:48.137 --> 03:58:49.578]  We're going to rock this money bomb.
[03:58:49.938 --> 03:58:51.900]  We've got $110,000.
[03:58:51.960 --> 03:58:52.920]  Keep it going strong.
[03:58:52.960 --> 03:58:55.342]  And I want to thank you, everybody, for tuning in.
[03:58:55.422 --> 03:58:58.084]  And tomorrow night, we've got a jam-packed show full of guests.
[03:58:58.744 --> 03:59:01.507]  So this is Dan Bodondi for InfoWars.com.
[03:59:01.927 --> 03:59:03.909]  Money... InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[03:59:04.069 --> 03:59:04.870]  Please donate.
[03:59:04.910 --> 03:59:05.671]  We need your money.
[03:59:05.971 --> 03:59:07.552]  We need to expand the operation.
[03:59:08.133 --> 03:59:09.574]  And have a good day and God bless you.
[03:59:30.560 --> 03:59:34.502]  You gotta keep, keep, keep Obama in President, you know?
[03:59:34.542 --> 03:59:36.323]  He gave us a fall.
[03:59:36.383 --> 03:59:37.544]  He gave us a fall.
[03:59:37.604 --> 03:59:38.744]  He gave us a fall.
[03:59:38.764 --> 03:59:42.186]  Keep, keep, keep Obama in President, you know?
[03:59:42.226 --> 03:59:43.086]  He gave us a fall.
[03:59:43.126 --> 03:59:44.287]  He gave us a fall.
[03:59:44.347 --> 03:59:45.508]  He gave us a fall.
[03:59:45.608 --> 03:59:48.289]  Everybody in Cleveland know Minority got...
[04:00:06.229 --> 04:00:08.294]  Okay, what's wrong with Romney again?
[04:00:50.903 --> 04:00:51.044]  Yes!
[04:00:51.064 --> 04:00:51.184]  Yes!
[04:00:51.205 --> 04:00:51.265]  Yes!
[04:00:51.385 --> 04:00:51.566]  Yes!
