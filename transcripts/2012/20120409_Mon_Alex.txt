[00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:06.372]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.372 --> 00:00:08.152]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.152 --> 00:00:09.893]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.893 --> 00:00:11.494]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.494 --> 00:00:13.034]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.034 --> 00:00:17.236]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.236 --> 00:00:21.338]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.642 --> 00:00:49.385]  Welcome my friends, welcome and thank you so much for joining us today on this Monday, the ninth day of April, 2012.
[00:00:49.385 --> 00:01:04.209]  We're gonna be live here for the next three hours and we have cleared the decks of guests today because I've got a lot of news I want to cover and also your phone calls.
[00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:08.690]  There is an article here in front of me out of the Smithsonian
[00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:31.892]  Also, a study conducted by the Club of Rome back in the 1970s basically called for them to engineer this, and now they sell the idea of peak oil and that we're all going to have austerity and be poor, as they systematically try to set up a post-industrial world and a system similar to the Hunger Games.
[00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:36.961]  Artificial poverty, artificial feudalism.
[00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:45.066]  Peak Civilization MIT research team predicts global economic collapse and population decline.
[00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:58.935]  They plan to cut off the resources to the entire world except for elite armored reservations and compounds in rural areas and in compact super city centers.
[00:01:58.935 --> 00:02:01.597]  And here it is, Club of Rome, Smithsonian Magazine and
[00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:06.420]  Limits to growth.
[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.782]  There's a video of that put out by the Globalist in the UN.
[00:02:10.782 --> 00:02:12.503]  Maury Strong, all of it.
[00:02:12.503 --> 00:02:25.949]  This is an article up at Infowars.com that was put together by Mac Slavo at the shtfplan.com.
[00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:32.641]  Can't really say the name of it here on air.
[00:02:32.641 --> 00:02:40.765]  But this is the type of post-industrial information that we've been putting out, and now the globalists are just being quite honest about it.
[00:02:40.765 --> 00:02:45.167]  Homeland security is not meant to keep the prosperity of the country going.
[00:02:45.167 --> 00:02:46.328]  It's meant to
[00:02:47.981 --> 00:02:58.528]  Be a straitjacket in the orderly collapse of society and it's going to go into a predatory society where you kill grandma to quote hire 10 new teachers as Bill Gates.
[00:02:58.528 --> 00:02:59.448]  That's a quote by the way.
[00:02:59.448 --> 00:03:01.289]  He said don't give her treatment, let her die.
[00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:03.431]  Hire 10 teachers, the teachers clap.
[00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:09.895]  The idea is you kill somebody or you steal from somebody or you shut somebody down, you get goodies.
[00:03:11.027 --> 00:03:18.412]  And so that's a cannibalistic, lose-lose, implosion, post-industrial system.
[00:03:18.412 --> 00:03:26.298]  And again, if you scroll down to the article that's at InfoWars.com, you can see the graphs of what the globalists have planned.
[00:03:26.298 --> 00:03:29.180]  Those of you that keep saying, where's the population reduction?
[00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.901]  Well, they've slowed the growth.
[00:03:30.901 --> 00:03:32.643]  They'd be at about 10 billion right now instead of 7.5.
[00:03:32.643 --> 00:03:33.403]  And by, as you can see there,
[00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:43.131]  By 2020 or so, on their graph, they plan to kill.
[00:03:43.131 --> 00:03:45.072]  Well, you can see the graph right there.
[00:03:45.072 --> 00:03:45.852]  What, that's about 90%?
[00:03:45.852 --> 00:03:49.233]  Officially from MIT?
[00:03:49.233 --> 00:03:51.734]  Oh, Alex, where's the plan to get us?
[00:03:51.734 --> 00:03:53.915]  Oh, where's the plan to kill us?
[00:03:53.915 --> 00:03:54.555]  Where is it?
[00:03:54.555 --> 00:03:57.997]  Oh, it's just in all these Rockefeller UN biological diversity assessments.
[00:03:57.997 --> 00:03:58.937]  Thousands of them!
[00:03:58.937 --> 00:04:02.318]  Here's another one, MIT!
[00:04:02.318 --> 00:04:03.559]  But they're all running around
[00:04:04.701 --> 00:04:07.263]  Acting like all this is just going to happen on accident.
[00:04:07.263 --> 00:04:08.164]  Let me explain something.
[00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:10.246]  The globalists already have super technologies.
[00:04:10.246 --> 00:04:11.667]  Life extension.
[00:04:11.667 --> 00:04:14.569]  For 20 years they've been able to make rats not age.
[00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.871]  Now they're reversing aging.
[00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:19.433]  We're not supposed to get access to that.
[00:04:19.433 --> 00:04:33.645]  And that's why I went to church this weekend at a little church and saw two disabled children out of maybe 15 that were in the whole church.
[00:04:34.702 --> 00:04:48.871]  And then, I even had, I've never been to this church before, I had the father come over and say he was a listener and say that research shows that he got the mutation when he was in his mother from her taking a vaccine.
[00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:53.093]  I mean, I'm just watching him do this to us.
[00:04:53.093 --> 00:04:56.795]  He was in a wheelchair and a listener.
[00:04:56.795 --> 00:04:58.877]  I mean, this is what they've done to us.
[00:05:02.179 --> 00:05:06.140]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:15.001]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:05:15.001 --> 00:05:19.642]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:05:19.642 --> 00:05:30.444]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:05:31.084 --> 00:05:40.606]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:46.028]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:05:46.028 --> 00:05:53.509]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:56.270]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:06:00.658 --> 00:06:01.718]  I had tried everything.
[00:06:01.718 --> 00:06:07.220]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.041]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[00:06:12.041 --> 00:06:18.423]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[00:06:18.903 --> 00:06:30.127]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:06:30.127 --> 00:06:34.589]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:37.590]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day,
[00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.853]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:06:40.853 --> 00:06:42.414]  Now that's results.
[00:06:42.414 --> 00:06:49.200]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:54.946]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.
[00:06:54.946 --> 00:06:57.488]  Start your journey to health and wellness today.
[00:06:57.488 --> 00:06:59.110]  Infowarsteam.com
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.400]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.982]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:07:06.982 --> 00:07:12.004]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:07:12.004 --> 00:07:12.464]  It's true.
[00:07:12.464 --> 00:07:17.026]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:07:17.566 --> 00:07:22.790]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.111]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:29.914]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:07:29.914 --> 00:07:31.035]  And here's the best part.
[00:07:31.035 --> 00:07:34.097]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:07:34.097 --> 00:07:37.720]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.902]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:07:40.902 --> 00:07:43.143]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:07:43.143 --> 00:07:44.064]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:07:47.686 --> 00:07:51.927]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:07:51.927 --> 00:07:56.748]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:07:56.748 --> 00:08:01.950]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:08.571]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:11.552]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:21.733 --> 00:08:36.311]  Every time I see an IMF, World Bank, UN, Club of Rome, Rockefeller Foundation, Carnegie Foundation, Ford Foundation document...
[00:08:37.150 --> 00:09:00.220]  Where the globalists are adding cancer viruses to our vaccines, mutagens to the vaccines, so that when pregnant women take shots, as they're now advised to do, which they've always known don't do, they can give their children life crippling, devastating disorders and diseases, gifts from the eugenicist mass murderers, their sacrament hurting the children.
[00:09:01.306 --> 00:09:03.447]  As every ancient psychoculture did.
[00:09:03.447 --> 00:09:06.668]  They just do it through covert means.
[00:09:06.668 --> 00:09:13.191]  Every time I see piles of new ones, it makes my head spin.
[00:09:13.191 --> 00:09:21.574]  And I got in this morning and they said RT, International Television, wants you on today about this article.
[00:09:21.574 --> 00:09:27.337]  And I had separately seen all of the articles and reports in this.
[00:09:31.343 --> 00:09:38.566]  By Mac Slavo at... When you know what hits the fanplan.com.
[00:09:38.566 --> 00:09:40.726]  It's also up at Infowars.com.
[00:09:40.726 --> 00:09:43.587]  We have it mirrored there.
[00:09:43.587 --> 00:09:46.928]  But still, it was like being punched in the stomach.
[00:09:46.928 --> 00:09:49.469]  That's how I describe it.
[00:09:49.469 --> 00:09:59.353]  And so before I get into the mass murder, the mayhem, the shootings taking place all over the United States that are only going to get worse,
[00:10:00.965 --> 00:10:07.728]  And the racial attacks on both sides, descending into Bedlam, and police being killed, and all of this.
[00:10:07.728 --> 00:10:11.630]  I wanna just briefly tell a story.
[00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:15.031]  I'm gonna get to this now, then we're gonna have wide open phones throughout the broadcast today.
[00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:18.953]  We are live, it is the ninth day of April, 2012.
[00:10:18.953 --> 00:10:27.857]  I wasn't even gonna talk about this, because he's just here in town visiting, but because he's part of the story, I have to tell it.
[00:10:29.881 --> 00:10:34.524]  Dave Mustaine and his wife and daughter are here in town staying with me, visiting.
[00:10:34.524 --> 00:10:37.326]  It turned out we've turned into really good friends.
[00:10:37.326 --> 00:10:41.329]  I've known him for years, but we've turned into really good friends.
[00:10:41.329 --> 00:10:44.731]  And we wanted to go to church somewhere.
[00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:49.735]  And Dave, I live out in the country, he said, that looks like an interesting little place, that little Baptist church.
[00:10:49.735 --> 00:10:51.576]  Let's go there.
[00:10:51.576 --> 00:10:54.298]  I've never been to a Baptist church.
[00:10:54.298 --> 00:10:56.580]  Shall we go to the services?
[00:10:58.325 --> 00:11:13.710]  At 11 a.m., and there's probably this little bitty church that's more full on a Easter Sunday, the most popular day of the year to go to church, I guess after Christmas.
[00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:16.971]  And we're there, and we come in right at 11.
[00:11:16.971 --> 00:11:23.113]  Like seconds before they start singing the first hymns.
[00:11:23.113 --> 00:11:26.454]  And so nobody sees me come in, nobody sees Dave Mustaine come in.
[00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:29.512]  Except for the ushers.
[00:11:29.512 --> 00:11:30.413]  Oh, Alex Jones.
[00:11:30.413 --> 00:11:37.683]  Oh, and then they were looking at Dave and his wife and I, my wife, my children were with my parents at their church in downtown Austin.
[00:11:37.683 --> 00:11:38.344]  So they weren't there.
[00:11:38.344 --> 00:11:40.647]  So we get in the back row.
[00:11:43.473 --> 00:11:49.238]  And sometimes you go to church and you don't really feel a powerful spiritual presence in the building.
[00:11:49.238 --> 00:11:57.005]  But these people were all really praying, really love God, and it was just an old-fashioned Baptist church service.
[00:11:57.005 --> 00:12:05.794]  It wasn't really one of their fire and damnation ones, but it was just a nice Easter service about the four different types of soil, and you throw the
[00:12:07.825 --> 00:12:18.648]  Seeds onto the hard soil, and then there's the rocky soil, and then there's the soil that's got too much stuff already growing on it, and then there's the soil that's just right.
[00:12:18.648 --> 00:12:35.832]  And the whole time I'm in there, I'm looking at this father and his four children, three sweet, cute, beautiful little girls, and his son, who's over on the side of the pew in a wheelchair,
[00:12:37.034 --> 00:12:39.096]  And you know, obviously has some medical issues.
[00:12:39.096 --> 00:12:42.279]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:12:42.279 --> 00:12:44.141]  And I'm watching the father holding his hand.
[00:12:44.141 --> 00:12:45.703]  They're about five rows up.
[00:12:45.703 --> 00:12:47.865]  They don't see me there.
[00:12:47.865 --> 00:12:51.208]  And I see some other child that's obviously disabled in there.
[00:12:51.208 --> 00:12:52.929]  And I'm just thinking.
[00:12:53.857 --> 00:13:21.326]  And I'm looking, I notice it's boys, it's the boys that are all, because the pesticides, the heavy metals, the fluoride, the vaccines, boys don't have the blood-brain barrier, the organ barriers aren't as strong, girls, any doctor will tell you this for thousands of years, but it's been medically proven, girls can take more poison, they can environmentally survive more things, gunshot wounds, girls are much tougher than men.
[00:13:21.326 --> 00:13:22.146]  Not physically.
[00:13:23.211 --> 00:13:27.612]  Women live longer because women have got to carry children.
[00:13:27.612 --> 00:13:29.293]  Women are tough.
[00:13:29.293 --> 00:13:34.854]  And so now the autism spiking in girls and other disorders and things, but it's the boys it's hitting.
[00:13:34.854 --> 00:13:42.936]  And I'm sitting there the whole time and you can call me psychic, whatever, this kind of stuff happens all the time, but really it's spiritual.
[00:13:42.936 --> 00:13:46.577]  I realized, I said, those people are going to be listeners.
[00:13:46.577 --> 00:13:49.538]  That child is vaccine damaged.
[00:13:52.819 --> 00:13:59.784]  And I kept wanting to get up and go around and go over there and just hug the young boy.
[00:13:59.784 --> 00:14:01.846]  He was about 10, 11 years old.
[00:14:01.846 --> 00:14:02.646]  And I said, you know what?
[00:14:02.646 --> 00:14:06.289]  I'm just going to get up here and walk out of here.
[00:14:06.289 --> 00:14:12.633]  You know, at the end, but I said, I, and then in my mind, you'd say, God said, no, you're going to end up meeting that child.
[00:14:12.633 --> 00:14:15.876]  And those people are listeners and they're going to come to you.
[00:14:15.876 --> 00:14:17.157]  So the church thing ends.
[00:14:18.635 --> 00:14:21.856]  We get up, Dave, his wife, everybody start leaving first.
[00:14:21.856 --> 00:14:27.917]  I'm leaving, the dad had somehow later seen me, runs over.
[00:14:27.917 --> 00:14:40.761]  And then his son comes up in the wheelchair, and they say, I listened to your show, and I'm not gonna get into their personal things they told me, even though you don't know their names, but people in the church may be listening, so I'm not gonna say.
[00:14:40.761 --> 00:14:46.242]  But he said, yeah, we've talked to doctors and they agree the vaccines did this, even the doctors, you know, basically.
[00:14:51.229 --> 00:14:57.198]  And it was just such an intense thing to be sitting there in a church of probably 95, 100 people.
[00:14:57.198 --> 00:15:00.784]  Well, I guess if you count the choir and the preacher, it was over 100 probably.
[00:15:00.784 --> 00:15:02.646]  There's probably 20 people up on the little stage.
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.822]  I mean, I knew I was gonna have an experience with that child in the wheelchair.
[00:15:12.822 --> 00:15:14.063]  I knew it.
[00:15:14.063 --> 00:15:16.645]  I saw the whole thing before it even happened.
[00:15:16.645 --> 00:15:17.705]  That's God.
[00:15:17.705 --> 00:15:19.106]  That's the spiritual.
[00:15:19.106 --> 00:15:29.253]  People who've never experienced this, like I do on a daily basis, don't know what it is, don't understand it, don't know it.
[00:15:29.253 --> 00:15:35.777]  But I think, and what was incredible is Dave had said that morning, he said,
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.280]  I think it's good we go there.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:49.043]  And he already told his wife, he said, I think Alex is going to have an experience at that church that's going to reaffirm to him that he needs to be in church to strengthen others that are in the church.
[00:15:49.043 --> 00:15:52.223]  He may not think he needs church, but he needs to find a good church.
[00:15:52.223 --> 00:15:54.064]  And I think something's going to happen today.
[00:15:54.064 --> 00:16:01.365]  And of course, you know, I'm not going to go into Dave's private things, but you know, Dave's had some real experiences with God and that's why he's no longer into the occult.
[00:16:01.365 --> 00:16:03.206]  He's a Christian, been a Christian now for many years.
[00:16:04.238 --> 00:16:07.421]  And as he said, the road just got smooth once he became a Christian.
[00:16:07.421 --> 00:16:10.623]  Hope he doesn't ever get tested like Job.
[00:16:10.623 --> 00:16:26.296]  But it was such an amazing, empowering, but also exhausting experience, because it's things like that happening.
[00:16:26.296 --> 00:16:30.180]  And of course, an atheist will say, well, that's just a coincidence.
[00:16:31.653 --> 00:16:34.514]  Really, I won't tell you the other stuff because people wouldn't believe it.
[00:16:34.514 --> 00:16:42.816]  That's nothing compared to hundreds of experiences I've had.
[00:16:42.816 --> 00:16:47.538]  Hundreds.
[00:16:47.538 --> 00:16:55.240]  Where it's just like, it's almost like this is too real, life is too intense, reality is so powerful.
[00:16:56.388 --> 00:17:07.530]  I know why people retreat into sports and television and sitcoms and alcohol and drugs and mindlessness because that's what the world has to offer and it's shallow.
[00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:17.693]  It's poisonous and unfulfilling but being fulfilled is so much more intense.
[00:17:17.693 --> 00:17:18.213]  It's like a
[00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:28.089]  It's an acid trip that never ends, that you can't get off of.
[00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:36.235]  Not that I've ever done hallucinations, but I've read about it and heard people say it's like, and I don't mean literal like hallucination, I'm saying reality is so intense.
[00:17:36.235 --> 00:17:48.002]  The colors of the light hitting leaves in an oak tree, or flowers in a field, or the ocean, or a sunset, or innocent children, and beauty, and just the beauty of women.
[00:17:50.489 --> 00:17:54.492]  I mean, I see beautiful women now, and I don't even think about sex with them.
[00:17:54.492 --> 00:18:09.485]  I just, like, just in awe at the life force and the beauty just crackling.
[00:18:09.485 --> 00:18:11.787]  I see life.
[00:18:11.787 --> 00:18:12.748]  I see the universe.
[00:18:13.726 --> 00:18:16.187]  And you've got to open yourself up to it to really realize.
[00:18:16.187 --> 00:18:18.168]  People like they always say, I want to go to space.
[00:18:18.168 --> 00:18:19.769]  I want to go to space.
[00:18:19.769 --> 00:18:20.930]  You're in space.
[00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:22.411]  I want to go to Mars.
[00:18:22.411 --> 00:18:23.351]  I want to go to Venus.
[00:18:23.351 --> 00:18:24.732]  I want to go to Neptune.
[00:18:24.732 --> 00:18:26.213]  I want to see these things.
[00:18:26.213 --> 00:18:27.173]  You do!
[00:18:27.173 --> 00:18:29.014]  You're on a planet.
[00:18:29.014 --> 00:18:36.598]  You're on an incredibly rare planet with giant oceans and incredible life forms and beauty.
[00:18:36.598 --> 00:18:38.119]  You're in the universe.
[00:18:38.119 --> 00:18:41.761]  You walk outside and you're so close to a sun, it burns your skin.
[00:18:42.895 --> 00:18:47.376]  We're bathed in a wide spectrum of different particles.
[00:18:47.376 --> 00:18:52.957]  But we recognize beauty.
[00:18:52.957 --> 00:18:57.538]  The firmament is the evidence of God.
[00:18:57.538 --> 00:18:58.858]  The architect.
[00:18:58.858 --> 00:19:00.719]  People say, oh, that's Luciferian's call.
[00:19:00.719 --> 00:19:02.339]  Their God, the architect.
[00:19:02.339 --> 00:19:09.020]  That counterfeit of the real architect, the real great architect.
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:12.501]  You look at what the New World Order builds, it builds horrible, ugly things that malfunction.
[00:19:13.601 --> 00:19:14.962]  Trying to always be God.
[00:19:14.962 --> 00:19:16.442]  Always saying they're God.
[00:19:16.442 --> 00:19:18.523]  Always saying they're going to take over our will.
[00:19:18.523 --> 00:19:19.544]  That's not what God does.
[00:19:19.544 --> 00:19:21.165]  God doesn't try to take over your will.
[00:19:21.165 --> 00:19:24.587]  God tries to empower you.
[00:19:24.587 --> 00:19:27.328]  But in a non-destructive way.
[00:19:27.328 --> 00:19:30.910]  So you can stare out into the universe anytime you want.
[00:19:31.653 --> 00:19:42.201]  You're on a planet with a thin ribbon of gases on the surface and all the mountains and all the people that came before us and lived and struggled and fought.
[00:19:42.201 --> 00:19:44.823]  And that's why it's the greatest sin the new world order commits.
[00:19:44.823 --> 00:19:53.930]  Not just killing and diseasing our young, but attacking our DNA, our future generations, everything that is the true blessings, the family.
[00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:57.693]  The system is waging unending war.
[00:19:57.693 --> 00:19:58.994]  Huge news coming up.
[00:20:00.675 --> 00:20:04.476]  Right now, the average family spends one-fourth of their income on food.

[00:22:30.516 --> 00:22:35.099]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:35.099 --> 00:22:40.903]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.

[00:24:21.086 --> 00:24:27.131]  The end, of all the elaborate plans.
[00:24:27.131 --> 00:24:33.136]  The end, of everything that stands.
[00:24:33.136 --> 00:24:33.957]  The end,
[00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:51.152]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:51.152 --> 00:24:55.356]  Thank you so much for joining us on this day after Easter.
[00:24:55.356 --> 00:24:57.558]  Worldwide transmission.
[00:25:02.042 --> 00:25:08.663]  Let me just give you a smattering of what's coming up, and I must cover all of this today in this little short segment.
[00:25:08.663 --> 00:25:18.166]  Let me just give you a preview, but I want to just briefly go back to the issue of pediatric cancers, depending on which statistical grouping you look at.
[00:25:18.166 --> 00:25:20.386]  On average, you're up about 10,000% since the 1950s.
[00:25:20.386 --> 00:25:20.826]  You heard me, 10,000%.
[00:25:20.826 --> 00:25:22.526]  What's the percentage increase?
[00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:44.397]  If we were 1 in 25,300 and change, neurological disorder classed as autism, and now it's 1 in 60 or 1 in 50 something, it varies.
[00:25:44.397 --> 00:25:47.399]  That's a multi-thousand increase as well.
[00:25:47.399 --> 00:25:54.363]  Diabetes, depending on the type, but the most common type's a 3,000% increase in the general public.
[00:25:54.363 --> 00:25:55.704]  Hispanics, it's even higher.
[00:25:57.432 --> 00:26:01.935]  I mean, I go to public places and see 30-year-old Hispanics with their arms and legs sawed off.
[00:26:01.935 --> 00:26:05.077]  And I don't need to ask them, but I have them like, oh, how are you doing?
[00:26:05.077 --> 00:26:06.979]  Oh, they're sitting there waiting for a prescription.
[00:26:06.979 --> 00:26:08.080]  You got diabetes?
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.621]  Yeah, they may have to chop another leg off.
[00:26:10.621 --> 00:26:12.182]  Oh, really?
[00:26:12.182 --> 00:26:15.525]  They tell you not to drink that big fat Diet Coke you're drinking?
[00:26:15.525 --> 00:26:17.586]  Doctor tell you not to do that?
[00:26:17.586 --> 00:26:18.467]  No.
[00:26:18.467 --> 00:26:20.308]  They told me to drink this.
[00:26:20.308 --> 00:26:24.211]  Yeah, you might actually find out that's worse than sugar for a diabetic.
[00:26:24.211 --> 00:26:24.691]  But you know what?
[00:26:24.691 --> 00:26:26.052]  I'm not going to give you medical advice.
[00:26:26.052 --> 00:26:26.793]  I actually do that.
[00:26:27.941 --> 00:26:31.405]  And it's not, because, you know, I see somebody with their legs sawed off.
[00:26:31.405 --> 00:26:33.627]  They're just all over the place.
[00:26:33.627 --> 00:26:35.990]  Hispanics everywhere, legs, arms sawed off.
[00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:49.145]  Just drive down to town, drive by bus stops, instead of just thinking about yourself, start looking at the bus stops, and you'll probably pass 10 bus stops before you run into a Hispanic person with their legs or arms cut off from diabetes.
[00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:53.589]  I just happen to notice things.
[00:26:53.589 --> 00:26:54.590]  You know, I go to a church.
[00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:55.690]  I just happen to notice.
[00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:56.370]  Let me see.
[00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:58.690]  How many kids are soft killing in here?
[00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:04.592]  Oh, there's one right there.
[00:27:04.592 --> 00:27:05.672]  Okay, they're not killing us?
[00:27:05.672 --> 00:27:07.753]  Then where is it coming from?
[00:27:07.753 --> 00:27:10.753]  Oh, I just happen to have all these documents where they admit they're doing it.
[00:27:10.753 --> 00:27:11.674]  That's coming up later.
[00:27:11.674 --> 00:27:13.994]  It's an article at Infowars.com.
[00:27:13.994 --> 00:27:15.154]  Peak civilization.
[00:27:15.154 --> 00:27:20.756]  MIT research team predicts global economic collapse and population decline.
[00:27:20.756 --> 00:27:21.356]  And they've got a
[00:27:25.796 --> 00:27:39.803]  You know, I'm sorry, they have a 90 plus percent, scroll down to MIT's graph, this is from MIT, that's a 90 plus percent decline in the population.
[00:27:39.803 --> 00:27:42.925]  How's that sound for you there?
[00:27:42.925 --> 00:27:46.707]  On some of those graphs, they've got different predictions.
[00:27:46.707 --> 00:27:50.169]  Services per capita, population, global population.
[00:27:50.169 --> 00:27:51.669]  No, global population is the blue one.
[00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:52.670]  Yeah, that's over 90 percent.
[00:27:54.166 --> 00:27:55.227]  You like that?
[00:27:55.227 --> 00:27:56.508]  You like that?
[00:27:56.508 --> 00:28:00.952]  That's why they're teaching your kids there's no, no, no oil left or no coal left.
[00:28:00.952 --> 00:28:16.605]  That's why they're teaching you that living is bad, having kids are bad, because they're getting everybody ready with the racial, psychological idea in memory and they got shows on history, discover, history science, PBS, all the major textbooks, college, high school, are getting everybody ready to die!
[00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:25.635]  Show when they release the bioweapons and the rest of it and cut off the third world supplies and huge wars break out in Bedlam.
[00:28:25.635 --> 00:28:29.578]  It won't matter in the West because we'll be so mesmerized by TV and drugs.
[00:28:29.578 --> 00:28:31.780]  Legal and illegal.
[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:34.822]  Now, again, it's a total diabolical plan.
[00:28:34.822 --> 00:28:39.806]  It's totally documented in such voluminous piles.
[00:28:40.825 --> 00:28:46.047]  And I need to calmly present this, but sometimes I think, well no, you shouldn't be calm about this.
[00:28:46.047 --> 00:28:48.748]  You've been successful because you are being real and freaking out.
[00:28:48.748 --> 00:28:50.729]  Because see, I'm freaking out.
[00:28:50.729 --> 00:29:02.314]  I can't go to a church with 100 people in it without seeing kids who you can tell are struggling for their lives, I'll just leave it at that, because of these New World Order people.
[00:29:04.915 --> 00:29:12.642]  And I don't feel too friendly towards the New World Order, but my hatred and my disgust is nothing compared to my love.
[00:29:12.642 --> 00:29:14.383]  And it's not because I'm a good person.
[00:29:14.383 --> 00:29:17.566]  I don't people, oh, he cares about, who doesn't?
[00:29:17.566 --> 00:29:20.749]  If I don't care about that kid, I don't care about mine.
[00:29:20.749 --> 00:29:24.372]  And it's not some conscious thing, but that's why I'm designed that way.
[00:29:24.372 --> 00:29:26.054]  You know, when you got
[00:29:29.273 --> 00:29:32.636]  10,000 plus percentage point increases in pediatric cancers.
[00:29:32.636 --> 00:29:36.939]  I think every day how I don't do enough to keep my kids away from GMO and the rest of it.
[00:29:36.939 --> 00:29:39.400]  I'm a piece of filth is what I am.
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.422]  I'm a piece of garbage.
[00:29:41.422 --> 00:29:43.403]  I'm not doing enough.
[00:29:43.403 --> 00:29:45.004]  I'm not focused enough.
[00:29:45.004 --> 00:29:47.946]  I'm too comfortable having all this going around me.
[00:29:47.946 --> 00:29:49.828]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:49.828 --> 00:29:51.229]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.229 --> 00:29:53.751]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.751 --> 00:29:56.413]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:12.565 --> 00:31:21.287]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.

[00:31:34.375 --> 00:31:38.217]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[00:31:38.217 --> 00:31:39.458]  Others don't.
[00:31:39.458 --> 00:31:41.599]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:31:41.599 --> 00:31:43.380]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:46.261]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[00:31:57.967 --> 00:31:58.828]  Others don't.
[00:32:00.089 --> 00:32:07.312]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[00:32:07.312 --> 00:32:25.200]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:29.322]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[00:32:29.602 --> 00:32:31.363]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[00:32:31.363 --> 00:32:39.529]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[00:33:08.591 --> 00:33:16.899]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:31.397 --> 00:33:38.400]  Okay, so my final little message to the New World Order people is this.
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:42.362]  You are not going to get away with what you're doing.
[00:33:42.362 --> 00:33:47.864]  God, the universe, justice is going to have victory over you.
[00:33:47.864 --> 00:34:00.329]  You're not going to disease the genetic genome of humanity and the planet while playing God and posing as the saviors of the earth while you run around and engage in your psychopathic activities and get away with it.
[00:34:01.257 --> 00:34:08.203]  You are not going to release your future bioweapons and get away with it unscathed.
[00:34:08.203 --> 00:34:12.848]  You are not going to reduce our population by over 90% and end up getting away with it.
[00:34:12.848 --> 00:34:22.216]  Because we're aware of you, we're exposing you, and the full horror of what you're doing is so huge, I understand that most people can't come to grips with it.
[00:34:22.216 --> 00:34:24.919]  But it's never a majority that prevails over evil.
[00:34:26.846 --> 00:34:28.688]  And we are getting the message out.
[00:34:28.688 --> 00:34:31.510]  We are reaching out to our fellow humans.
[00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:33.452]  And the organizations are being formed.
[00:34:33.452 --> 00:34:35.794]  The ideas are being developed.
[00:34:35.794 --> 00:34:38.536]  The information and the countermeasures are being deployed.
[00:34:38.536 --> 00:34:41.679]  And we have only begun to fight.
[00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:47.584]  In fact, our new motto is going to be taken from John Paul Jones, father of the U.S.
[00:34:47.584 --> 00:34:48.545]  Navy.
[00:34:48.545 --> 00:34:52.849]  He says, I have just begun to fight, or I have only just begun to fight.
[00:34:55.441 --> 00:34:58.283]  To WE have just begun to fight.
[00:34:58.283 --> 00:35:01.385]  In fact, will you guys pull up the John Paul Jones famous quote for me?
[00:35:01.385 --> 00:35:07.930]  I want to make sure I'm getting it word for word exactly right.
[00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:14.215]  And another saying that he had was win or die.
[00:35:14.215 --> 00:35:15.796]  You know, victory or death from
[00:35:16.983 --> 00:35:18.946]  Colonel Travis at the Alamo.
[00:35:18.946 --> 00:35:21.750]  But it is death if we don't have victory over these people.
[00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:23.492]  It is enslavement.
[00:35:23.492 --> 00:35:24.354]  It is bondage.
[00:35:24.354 --> 00:35:28.399]  It's dying those thousands of little cowardly deaths every day.
[00:35:29.775 --> 00:35:54.654]  And I think about how much the globalists enjoy people having to form children, how much they enjoy children dying excruciating deaths, how much they enjoy the troops breathing to you, and then coming home and having children with incredibly painful malformations and disorders and diseases, and how much they just enjoy going to work every day.
[00:35:55.441 --> 00:35:58.103]  The Globalists talk about their eugenics and how much they enjoy it.
[00:35:58.103 --> 00:36:04.589]  They really enjoy killing people in horrible, painful, soul-sucking, life-destroying...
[00:36:06.716 --> 00:36:07.956]  Illnesses.
[00:36:07.956 --> 00:36:21.261]  Of course, many times these painful experiences actually only make people grow more spiritually, so God turns that to good, but it is just unspeakable what the New World Order does, and I want them to know I see what you do.
[00:36:21.261 --> 00:36:24.502]  I see you playing in the guts of our children.
[00:36:24.502 --> 00:36:34.646]  I see you running around with wanton repine, with bloodthirst, hurting the innocents, as all of your ilk have done throughout history.
[00:36:35.126 --> 00:36:37.186]  And I'm fully aware of what you're doing.
[00:36:37.186 --> 00:36:39.027]  And you will be brought very, very low.
[00:36:39.027 --> 00:36:47.689]  I have not yet begun to fight.
[00:36:47.689 --> 00:36:50.069]  Was uttered in reply to a cheerful British taunt.
[00:36:50.069 --> 00:36:57.131]  You know, that was when both ships were on fire, but the bigger British ship was sinking his.
[00:36:57.131 --> 00:36:58.231]  And they still didn't give up.
[00:36:58.231 --> 00:37:01.312]  That ended up... Their powder room blew up.
[00:37:01.312 --> 00:37:02.752]  And then he got the big victory.
[00:37:04.451 --> 00:37:07.213]  That happened over and over again with John Paul Jones.
[00:37:07.213 --> 00:37:08.174]  Amazing.
[00:37:08.174 --> 00:37:12.177]  Amazing, all those real stories from the Revolutionary War.
[00:37:12.177 --> 00:37:19.724]  There were cases where he'd, like me, he'd fight five ships and all five of the other ships would be bigger than his and win.
[00:37:19.724 --> 00:37:24.608]  Because you've got to go straight at them.
[00:37:24.608 --> 00:37:25.809]  You've got to come straight on.
[00:37:27.071 --> 00:37:31.332]  And that's the real power lies in being outnumbered.
[00:37:31.332 --> 00:37:35.594]  The real power lies from having nothing left to lose.
[00:37:35.594 --> 00:37:37.795]  That's where it is.
[00:37:37.795 --> 00:37:40.195]  And saying, I am committed.
[00:37:40.195 --> 00:37:41.036]  You're on fire.
[00:37:41.036 --> 00:37:42.036]  You're sinking.
[00:37:42.036 --> 00:37:43.497]  Strike your colors.
[00:37:43.497 --> 00:37:50.759]  I have not yet begun to fight.
[00:37:50.759 --> 00:37:56.321]  And then members of the crew wanted to give up and he turned around, pulled his sword out and said, I'm going to start chopping you up.
[00:37:58.027 --> 00:38:10.033]  If you give up.
[00:38:10.033 --> 00:38:19.257]  And that was just fighting because they were tired of the oppressive British rule basically having double the taxes on people in the colonies than they had back in England.
[00:38:19.257 --> 00:38:25.100]  They were just tired of the corruption and the swaggering government bureaucrats and the swaggering police.
[00:38:26.752 --> 00:38:29.594]  That was just because they didn't like being bullied.
[00:38:29.594 --> 00:38:35.439]  Imagine if the founders would have known that they were being injected with cancer viruses or their children being deformed.
[00:38:35.439 --> 00:38:54.193]  I mean, that's how sick... These globalists hate America and the West so much that the Romans would come into an area that resisted them and kill everyone and tear down the emplacements and throw expensive salt into the earth so they couldn't grow crops.
[00:38:56.084 --> 00:39:00.929]  Inside the walled cities, so they couldn't down the road have another siege.
[00:39:00.929 --> 00:39:05.073]  You know, in case they didn't catch everybody and people ran to the hills and later went back to the fort.
[00:39:05.073 --> 00:39:13.741]  When they came back, the well was poisoned, the areas inside the fort where you could grow some crops, the earth was salted.
[00:39:13.741 --> 00:39:16.184]  Well, the globalists are salting our loins.
[00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.821]  Sperm counts down by almost 90%.
[00:39:19.821 --> 00:39:26.204]  It's like 87% last number I saw a few years ago from the Centers for Disease Control.
[00:39:26.204 --> 00:39:31.307]  They're like, gee, we don't know why it's happening.
[00:39:31.307 --> 00:39:33.909]  Same numbers, similar numbers in Europe.
[00:39:33.909 --> 00:39:36.650]  Women's eggs and ovaries are just fried on average.
[00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:42.553]  If you're going to have children, you better get started early, because that stuff really kicks in later.
[00:39:42.553 --> 00:39:45.635]  Your body's resilient, but not that resilient.
[00:39:45.635 --> 00:39:46.776]  The IQs are dropping.
[00:39:48.592 --> 00:39:50.754]  The life expectancies are dropping.
[00:39:50.754 --> 00:39:55.139]  Every disease and neurological disorder is just turbocharged right now.
[00:39:55.139 --> 00:39:57.481]  And it's going to get crazier and crazier.
[00:39:57.481 --> 00:40:02.606]  You know, the media is like, OK, well, it's not the vaccines because Bill and Melinda Gates say so, but gee.
[00:40:04.087 --> 00:40:07.730]  The reporters are like, my kid got the shot and can't walk or talk now.
[00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:15.476]  He was 18 months old and healthy and happy, but they say it in the shot, but he had a convulsion on the way home, and Bobby doesn't talk anymore.
[00:40:15.476 --> 00:40:17.798]  And my neighbor's kid, same thing.
[00:40:17.798 --> 00:40:20.420]  You really, government?
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:22.782]  It's 1 in 50-something now, it wasn't 1 in 25,000.
[00:40:22.782 --> 00:40:24.103]  What's going on?
[00:40:24.103 --> 00:40:32.189]  The government's like, we'll have a local jog, a race, and you'll raise some money and give it to an organization we control, and then we'll make sure you never get the answer.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:36.999]  They're like, oh, you're gonna continue to take our sons from us?
[00:40:36.999 --> 00:40:37.522]  Thank you!
[00:40:42.108 --> 00:40:46.270]  It's like, maybe if we're really lucky, we can lower little coffins into the ground.
[00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:50.913]  And then there'll be a local race for us or something.
[00:40:50.913 --> 00:40:57.976]  And then you can go join a big group under the American Medical Association that's helping cover all this up and give them money.
[00:40:57.976 --> 00:41:03.760]  To always talk about treating autism, not finding out why it's exploding.
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:06.101]  Oh, let's have another race.
[00:41:06.101 --> 00:41:07.622]  Walk up to the counter at restaurants.
[00:41:08.741 --> 00:41:10.482]  We're good to go.
[00:41:38.248 --> 00:41:39.949]  It says 30% is going to this.
[00:41:39.949 --> 00:41:42.071]  The rest is to the awareness program.
[00:41:42.071 --> 00:41:45.973]  That's how this shoe store, you know, is trying to give people breast cancer awareness.
[00:41:45.973 --> 00:41:48.315]  It's basically advertisement for you.
[00:41:48.315 --> 00:41:49.316]  Let me explain something.
[00:41:49.316 --> 00:41:53.999]  If you don't want your wife or mother's breast to rot off, that's the type of thing I say in public.
[00:41:53.999 --> 00:41:54.780]  People start getting mad.
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:55.760]  I don't care.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.562]  Hey, what's your problem, buddy?
[00:41:57.562 --> 00:42:01.004]  You like the fact breast cancer's off the charts right now?
[00:42:01.004 --> 00:42:05.908]  Why is it always we want to find a treatment for it or a cure?
[00:42:05.908 --> 00:42:07.809]  Why don't we try to find out why everybody's getting it?
[00:42:13.274 --> 00:42:16.596]  And a few times I've had people say, shut up, pal.
[00:42:16.596 --> 00:42:18.376]  Happened at the airport.
[00:42:18.376 --> 00:42:26.120]  Once with Rob Doon, this guy came over because I was talking to some people and started a fight with me.
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:32.263]  The police were putting him in handcuffs until I declined to press charges and assaulted me.
[00:42:32.263 --> 00:42:34.424]  We even had the end of the exchange on video.
[00:42:39.738 --> 00:42:41.020]  Just like when I was at the Grand Canyon.
[00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:41.961]  That's on video.
[00:42:41.961 --> 00:42:42.482]  And the U.N.
[00:42:42.482 --> 00:42:43.903]  sign's out there saying it's all under U.N.
[00:42:43.903 --> 00:42:46.086]  control in the surrounding area.
[00:42:46.086 --> 00:42:48.189]  And there's no one out there by the side of this ranger station.
[00:42:48.189 --> 00:42:51.113]  I'm on the backside and a guy hears me.
[00:42:52.329 --> 00:43:00.217]  Because I was shooting video and heard him talking to his wife and look back, he walks like 30 feet out of the way to talk trash about me and imply I need to get out of the way.
[00:43:00.217 --> 00:43:13.871]  Well, I'll come in, honey, as soon as I get a chance to read this plaque that this guy's standing in front of talking because an American was there talking around the side of some windswept thing at the Grand Canyon at the main
[00:43:16.806 --> 00:43:20.112]  Park Ranger Center that literally almost no one was in.
[00:43:20.112 --> 00:43:21.635]  Big, giant, sprawling facility.
[00:43:21.635 --> 00:43:23.458]  I'm around the side showing a U.N.
[00:43:23.458 --> 00:43:26.664]  sign, just shooting a video, and the guy coming over is on video.
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:30.021]  Talking trash, getting in my space right behind me.
[00:43:30.021 --> 00:43:39.185]  He had like American flags on his hat and all this veteran stuff, and he was kind of bowing up like he was a tough guy back in the Navy 40 years ago, beating people up like he was intimidating me.
[00:43:39.185 --> 00:43:42.346]  And as soon as I turned around and got in his face, he ran off.
[00:43:42.346 --> 00:43:45.347]  Listen, you un-American punk piece of filth!
[00:43:45.347 --> 00:43:47.468]  I will go shoot video of the U.N.
[00:43:47.468 --> 00:43:48.848]  takeover, you trash!
[00:43:48.848 --> 00:43:49.589]  You coward!
[00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:54.851]  Let me tell you, it's you people that are going to destroy this country, festooned with your American flags everywhere.
[00:43:55.811 --> 00:44:02.315]  You people who think you've got all this strength and you think I'm putting America down by showing how America's being taken over?
[00:44:02.315 --> 00:44:04.696]  It's you people that have allowed this to happen!
[00:44:04.696 --> 00:44:06.617]  Because you'll do whatever the government says.
[00:44:06.617 --> 00:44:07.177]  If the U.S.
[00:44:07.177 --> 00:44:08.238]  government sticks a U.N.
[00:44:08.238 --> 00:44:10.339]  sign out there pointing out under U.S.
[00:44:10.339 --> 00:44:14.201]  code that it's owned and controlled by the U.N., then it must be good.
[00:44:14.201 --> 00:44:16.162]  And I'm the traitor for not liking it!
[00:44:17.452 --> 00:44:27.458]  You'd come out of your way to henpeck another citizen to shut me up like you were a sergeant keeping the troops mouths quiet if they grumbled on base.
[00:44:27.458 --> 00:44:32.762]  Gee Sarge, I don't think we should be handling this chemical weapon with our hands and taking it to the incinerators.
[00:44:32.762 --> 00:44:33.582]  Shut up!
[00:44:33.582 --> 00:44:34.363]  I've heard the stories.
[00:44:34.363 --> 00:44:40.167]  A person five years later is getting lowered into the ground from the chemicals.
[00:44:40.167 --> 00:44:41.788]  It's this culture of denial.
[00:44:41.788 --> 00:44:46.731]  Listen, I can handle people being jellyfish and rolling over in a ditch and begging for destruction.
[00:44:47.796 --> 00:44:52.817]  But don't try to get in my way when I'm trying to warn people that want to hear the warning, okay?
[00:44:52.817 --> 00:44:54.418]  Get out of my way!
[00:44:54.418 --> 00:44:55.678]  Get out of my way!
[00:44:55.678 --> 00:45:00.159]  Don't you dare lecture me to give money to breast cancer research, okay?
[00:45:00.159 --> 00:45:01.720]  I've done the breast cancer research.
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:03.180]  I've had the top scientists on.
[00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:04.520]  They know good and well.
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:06.921]  By the way, Bayer is back in the news.
[00:45:06.921 --> 00:45:13.863]  It turns out the Environmental Protection Agency has internal reports and has known for many years what we already knew.
[00:45:15.357 --> 00:45:25.384]  One particular type of pesticide put out by Bayer and their pesticide division is the main cause of a cocktail of reasons killing the honeybees.
[00:45:25.384 --> 00:45:29.807]  What do you think it's doing to you?
[00:45:29.807 --> 00:45:42.655]  Bayer are the people who knowingly for over a decade shipped out Factor VIII blood supply to hemophiliacs knowing every injection was filled with all forms of hepatitis and HIV.
[00:45:42.655 --> 00:45:43.856]  Mycoplasms, you name it.
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:48.741]  I've got that report today at PINFOWARS.COM.
[00:45:48.741 --> 00:45:54.604]  Internal documents leaked by good people inside the government.
[00:45:54.604 --> 00:45:56.485]  Good people in government?
[00:45:56.485 --> 00:46:08.871]  In 2000, 2004, and a few years ago, went before Congress, 90 plus percent of the EPA scientists, as well as a bunch of the FDA scientists, went public and said, take the fluoride out, it's causing cancer, brain damage, and gave the reports.
[00:46:08.871 --> 00:46:09.712]  That's all on record.
[00:46:09.712 --> 00:46:10.932]  You never see that on the news.
[00:46:10.932 --> 00:46:11.873]  They just call you kooks!
[00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:25.753]  They knowingly are spraying pesticides like fluoride on crops that bioaccumulates and goes right through the cell wall of the plant.
[00:46:25.753 --> 00:46:38.556]  And if it can go through the cell walls of plants, what do you think it does to the cell membranes of humans that are incredibly weak compared to a plant's cell walls when it goes into your stomach and into your liver?
[00:46:38.556 --> 00:46:40.076]  What do you think it's doing?
[00:46:40.076 --> 00:46:43.357]  The strongest of us are in a dazed state.
[00:46:44.244 --> 00:46:47.025]  When you say the public is in a day state, it's like they're on drugs.
[00:46:47.025 --> 00:46:48.706]  They are on drugs.
[00:46:48.706 --> 00:46:50.567]  They are on chemicals.
[00:46:50.567 --> 00:46:52.107]  And this is the big curse.
[00:46:52.107 --> 00:46:57.290]  By the way, I forgot to get to this because it came out on Infowars.com on Saturday.
[00:46:57.290 --> 00:47:02.192]  When you guys go into the archive, that ought to be red-linked at the bottom of the Featured News area.
[00:47:02.192 --> 00:47:04.853]  There's a tiny little link that says Featured News Archive.
[00:47:07.202 --> 00:47:14.388]  And the RSS feed, Infowars.com forward slash feed, is such an important area to bookmark, because that's where all the key articles are in that feed.
[00:47:14.388 --> 00:47:29.600]  At the TED Technology Conference in Deutschland, in Germany, in Berlin, Melinda Gates got up and responded to those saying that they're really a covert population reduction program.
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:34.725]  I mean, we're really... Kony, 2012, without a new video, encountered myself and others in it.
[00:47:35.518 --> 00:47:37.860]  Again, we are hitting on all cylinders.
[00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:40.702]  We are blasting holes in them, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:40.702 --> 00:47:43.164]  You're like, well, they'll kill the general public, why won't they kill you?
[00:47:43.164 --> 00:47:46.366]  Because they don't want to validate everything I've said.
[00:47:46.366 --> 00:47:50.550]  They drop napalm on me, I become a night light.
[00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:57.995]  I become a lighthouse on the hill.
[00:47:57.995 --> 00:47:59.416]  Because I've already said it all.
[00:48:00.279 --> 00:48:02.080]  I just repeat it, basically.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:03.501]  And give you the latest data.
[00:48:03.501 --> 00:48:05.603]  Because I've already sent the message.
[00:48:05.603 --> 00:48:07.925]  Because I've already sent the data.
[00:48:07.925 --> 00:48:10.687]  All they do, smashing me, will be feed the Liberty Tree.
[00:48:10.687 --> 00:48:11.307]  They know that.
[00:48:11.307 --> 00:48:14.129]  And they still may smash me.
[00:48:14.129 --> 00:48:17.612]  I'm a little selfish and don't want that in my flesh, but my spirit says go ahead.
[00:48:18.783 --> 00:48:36.908]  Because let me tell you, if I give up my life so that one child isn't deformed and doesn't live their life out in a wheelchair having trouble living, just because you smiley-eyed devils enjoy it and love killing people and get off on hurting children, you think I'm worried?
[00:48:36.908 --> 00:48:40.228]  I just want you to know if you kill me, I've already won, okay?
[00:48:40.228 --> 00:48:41.869]  I've already won doing the right thing.
[00:48:41.869 --> 00:48:43.429]  I've already won fighting you.
[00:48:43.429 --> 00:48:45.830]  I've already won standing up against you.
[00:48:45.830 --> 00:48:46.410]  I want you to know that.
[00:48:47.756 --> 00:48:48.717]  You understand that?
[00:48:48.717 --> 00:48:50.138]  There's nothing you can do to me.
[00:48:50.138 --> 00:48:54.801]  You can destroy my name, you can drag me through the mud, you can destroy whatever you want.
[00:48:54.801 --> 00:48:55.542]  It doesn't matter.
[00:48:55.542 --> 00:49:08.972]  The transmission has been sent and I already see thousands of blogs and websites imitating and duplicating my research and even making it better and expanding on it and getting into it at a very, very deep level.
[00:49:08.972 --> 00:49:14.777]  So, there is such a point of satisfaction knowing you are too late.
[00:49:16.078 --> 00:49:21.003]  And I'm going to keep on going after I'm dead or if God lets me continue to live and do my work.
[00:49:21.003 --> 00:49:24.948]  I'm going to continue firing at you and sending out the message.
[00:49:24.948 --> 00:49:27.731]  But I've already sent out the message.
[00:49:27.731 --> 00:49:31.355]  It's already been transmitted worldwide, globally against you.
[00:49:33.186 --> 00:49:39.347]  Here's the article, Melinda Gates worrying about population control has led to too much suffering and death.
[00:49:39.347 --> 00:49:46.989]  Great article by one of our great researchers, but I would have gone with the headline, and again, I don't get to operate as editor most of the time because I can't work all the time.
[00:49:46.989 --> 00:49:55.550]  Just like, Melinda Gates responds, you know, Melinda Gates responds to those saying that she's a population control front.
[00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:56.150]  Something like that.
[00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:58.571]  Because again, the key is get this read.
[00:50:00.049 --> 00:50:04.971]  Melinda Gates, worrying about population control has led to much suffering and death.
[00:50:04.971 --> 00:50:06.292]  And so it's a weird spin.
[00:50:06.292 --> 00:50:14.616]  She goes on to say, worrying about us trying to reduce population is causing suffering and death.
[00:50:14.616 --> 00:50:21.400]  And there's the quote on screen for folks that are watching.
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:25.922]  Okay, I've been pretty wound up not doing the Sunday show live and now being here on Monday.
[00:50:27.350 --> 00:50:33.121]  So I am going to try to come back and start getting into the news and I haven't even gotten into the top stories yet.
[00:50:36.161 --> 00:50:37.122]  It's big.
[00:50:37.122 --> 00:50:38.563]  Okay, I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:50:38.563 --> 00:50:43.206]  It's big, and it shows how they're attacking us, knowingly trying to hurt us.
[00:50:43.206 --> 00:50:54.153]  They're going to try to use a societal collapse that's coming from the zombification flashpoint that we're about to reach to then call for total martial law.
[00:50:54.153 --> 00:50:57.115]  I'm going to give you the lowdown on that straight ahead.
[00:50:57.115 --> 00:50:58.396]  InfoWars.com.
[00:50:58.396 --> 00:50:58.996]  Calls are coming up.
[00:50:58.996 --> 00:50:59.757]  I'm going to give the number out.
[00:51:00.788 --> 00:51:02.189]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:51:02.189 --> 00:51:12.876]  Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.

[00:51:34.830 --> 00:51:40.974]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[00:51:40.974 --> 00:51:50.860]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:52.361]  The war is here.
[00:51:52.361 --> 00:51:54.262]  It's an info war.
[00:51:54.262 --> 00:51:57.084]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[00:52:00.666 --> 00:52:05.890]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:53:03.629 --> 00:53:08.813]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[00:53:08.813 --> 00:53:10.674]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[00:53:10.674 --> 00:53:14.217]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with Fake TV.
[00:53:14.217 --> 00:53:21.662]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television, so from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[00:53:21.662 --> 00:53:26.166]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[00:53:26.166 --> 00:53:31.910]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.

[00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:58.321]  Faketv.com, the burglar deterrent.
[00:54:04.298 --> 00:54:23.034]  Day after day Alone on a hill The man with the foolish grin Is keeping perfectly still But nobody wants to know him They can see that he's just a fool
[00:54:24.534 --> 00:54:25.455]  Welcome back.
[00:54:25.455 --> 00:54:27.297]  Alright, let me do this.
[00:54:27.297 --> 00:54:36.186]  Let me just read to you this little stack of headlines.
[00:54:48.183 --> 00:54:57.492]  Antidepressant drugs causing epidemic of mania, mayhem, and murder.
[00:54:57.492 --> 00:54:58.573]  Here's another headline.
[00:54:58.573 --> 00:55:01.976]  That's from Infowars.com by Paul Watson and Alex Jones.
[00:55:01.976 --> 00:55:02.697]  That just came out.
[00:55:02.697 --> 00:55:04.799]  It's redlinked at Infowars.com.
[00:55:04.799 --> 00:55:07.141]  That means please get it out to everybody.
[00:55:07.141 --> 00:55:08.642]  Here's the Los Angeles Times.
[00:55:10.026 --> 00:55:12.267]  A fog of drugs and war.
[00:55:12.267 --> 00:55:15.868]  More than 110,000 active duty troops.
[00:55:15.868 --> 00:55:19.690]  That's about 10% of the troops.
[00:55:19.690 --> 00:55:23.772]  Last year took antidepressants, sedatives, and other prescription medications.
[00:55:23.772 --> 00:55:26.113]  Some see a link to aberrant behavior.
[00:55:26.113 --> 00:55:32.915]  Gee, they won't release it, but they've had army psychiatrists go public and say that Bayles was on psychotropics.
[00:55:32.915 --> 00:55:39.438]  And on the insert, it says causes mania, psychotic breaks, suicide, and violent
[00:55:40.475 --> 00:55:42.817]  Mood swings.
[00:55:42.817 --> 00:55:53.064]  I mean, in Criminology 101, they've known for 20 years that they pull up to a house and a woman has chopped her children up or killed them in the bathtub or dancing naked on the roof, cutting themselves with knives.
[00:55:53.064 --> 00:55:54.845]  I talked to a Houston cop who saw that.
[00:55:54.845 --> 00:56:01.610]  And they knew as soon as they got her down, that when they knew, they'd find Prozac or one of those variants in the medicine cabinet.
[00:56:01.610 --> 00:56:02.291]  Sure enough, it was there.
[00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:05.470]  It's in the hallucinogen class.
[00:56:05.470 --> 00:56:16.393]  And the guy that, no criminal record, computer programmer, in a hallucination of chemical imbalance, with a Xanax prescription, was at Walmart to pick it up.
[00:56:16.393 --> 00:56:21.455]  And people said he was like on drugs, so they called, should've just left him alone, folks.
[00:56:21.455 --> 00:56:23.475]  So what if a guy's stumbling around in a store?
[00:56:23.475 --> 00:56:25.936]  That's why you mind your own business.
[00:56:25.936 --> 00:56:29.257]  Now if he'd have done something to a lady or somebody, then you call the cops or do something.
[00:56:30.134 --> 00:56:32.315]  But no, you didn't mind your own business.
[00:56:32.315 --> 00:56:34.416]  There's a guy acting weird in the store.
[00:56:34.416 --> 00:56:39.399]  You call the cop, he comes in, he shoots him in the neck and kills him last Thursday night here in Austin, Texas.
[00:56:39.399 --> 00:56:47.243]  And I said to my crew that morning before it even came out, it happened that night, I said, I bet he was on serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[00:56:47.243 --> 00:56:48.283]  He was on them.
[00:56:48.283 --> 00:56:53.746]  It's confirmed now in the Austin American Statesman Xanax, which is in the psychotropic class.
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:57:04.687]  Oh, you bet it handles not having anxiety anymore when you drink too much coffee, because you're always in a la-la dream state.
[00:57:04.687 --> 00:57:08.990]  Bales shooting 20-something people, but a lot of them kids, killing 18.
[00:57:10.444 --> 00:57:12.125]  Been in psychiatric care?
[00:57:12.125 --> 00:57:13.146]  Four turs?
[00:57:13.146 --> 00:57:16.127]  Oh, let's take somebody and put them on a hallucinogenic drug.
[00:57:16.127 --> 00:57:16.748]  That's what they are.
[00:57:16.748 --> 00:57:18.169]  They put you, though, in a dream state.
[00:57:18.169 --> 00:57:19.309]  You don't see peak animals.
[00:57:19.309 --> 00:57:22.491]  You're in just a happy, I'm not worried about anything now.
[00:57:22.491 --> 00:57:24.833]  Because my subconscious is in full control.
[00:57:24.833 --> 00:57:26.353]  I'm like an unconscious person.
[00:57:26.353 --> 00:57:30.736]  It's a chemical, part-time lobotomy.
[00:57:30.736 --> 00:57:33.578]  I mean, the inserts say they did it.
[00:57:33.578 --> 00:57:38.541]  Every school shooting, every one, it comes out there on the drugs.
[00:57:38.541 --> 00:57:38.941]  Every one.
[00:57:41.593 --> 00:57:47.555]  It's admitted, it's in the Eli Lilly trials of Prozac.
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:58:02.448]  In 1980, 81, they had record, what was it, 15 time increase in suicides, and some of the people doing the test murdered their families.
[00:58:02.448 --> 00:58:04.850]  Oh, this is a wonderful idea.
[00:58:04.850 --> 00:58:09.333]  Let's give the Delta Force some psychotropics when they come back.
[00:58:09.333 --> 00:58:16.619]  Oh, and then at Fort Bragg in one weekend, they had four incidents, three of them where the Delta Force people killed their families.
[00:58:16.619 --> 00:58:18.400]  In the fourth, the guy set his house on fire.
[00:58:20.615 --> 00:58:22.456]  Oh, that's normal.
[00:58:22.456 --> 00:58:23.316]  That's very normal.
[00:58:23.316 --> 00:58:30.720]  Of course, then the Pentagon admits, oh, we're testing newer, more advanced amnesiac psychotropics on them.
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:33.502]  Oh, which are used in mind control.
[00:58:33.502 --> 00:58:43.287]  Over one-tenth of active duty is on mind control drugs.
[00:58:43.287 --> 00:58:47.249]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.575 --> 00:58:55.138]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:55.138 --> 00:58:56.038]  Number one.
[00:58:56.038 --> 00:58:59.461]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:59.461 --> 00:59:00.321]  Number two.
[00:59:00.321 --> 00:59:05.224]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:05.224 --> 00:59:05.965]  It's true.
[00:59:05.965 --> 00:59:10.828]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:10.828 --> 00:59:11.668]  Number three.
[00:59:11.668 --> 00:59:15.251]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:15.251 --> 00:59:18.933]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:19.153 --> 00:59:19.954]  Number 4.
[00:59:19.954 --> 00:59:22.717]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.717 --> 00:59:26.382]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:26.382 --> 00:59:27.183]  Number 5.
[00:59:27.183 --> 00:59:31.328]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:31.328 --> 00:59:36.094]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:36.374 --> 00:59:40.536]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:48.181]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:48.181 --> 00:59:49.401]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:10.112]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.112 --> 01:00:11.712]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.712 --> 01:00:13.233]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.233 --> 01:00:17.434]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.434 --> 01:00:21.516]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:38.172 --> 01:00:45.075]  All right, my friends, I just ranted and went through news in the first hour.
[01:00:45.075 --> 01:00:48.957]  I haven't even gotten to the main bulk of the off-the-chart news.
[01:00:48.957 --> 01:00:50.058]  And I haven't given the number out.
[01:00:50.058 --> 01:00:54.940]  I didn't want to take a lot of calls today.
[01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:57.221]  But here is just some of the news.
[01:00:57.221 --> 01:01:00.503]  Again, I'm going to go over this more later in more detail.
[01:01:02.945 --> 01:01:07.269]  110,000 active duty trips on psychotropics and other mind control drugs.
[01:01:07.269 --> 01:01:21.782]  And they're saying, gee, could that be why they're running around and attacking police and robbing things and killing their families and, gee, going off base at night and killing 18 people and including two-year-old children and setting them on fire?
[01:01:22.803 --> 01:01:34.809]  Oh, you took a guy who's been in four tours of heavy combat and had part of his foot blown off and asked to not be redeployed and you put him on Prozac and sent him back out there?
[01:01:34.809 --> 01:01:40.012]  And then a roadside bomb blew up some of his buddies a few days before and he snapped?
[01:01:40.012 --> 01:01:48.136]  What, you shouldn't give hardcore trained killers who've had their foot already partly blown off and then their buddies get killed in front of them?
[01:01:48.136 --> 01:01:50.277]  You shouldn't put them on a hallucinogenic drug?
[01:01:51.906 --> 01:01:58.588]  That says it causes violent swings where you don't control yourself and kill people?
[01:01:58.588 --> 01:02:00.729]  Oh, you want to give that to a trained killer?
[01:02:00.729 --> 01:02:04.810]  That is a really, really, really good idea.
[01:02:04.810 --> 01:02:09.091]  That's a super-duper idea.
[01:02:09.091 --> 01:02:13.773]  And then you want to give these drugs to people saying, oh, you're having anxiety.
[01:02:13.773 --> 01:02:16.133]  We'll just put you on Xanax.
[01:02:16.133 --> 01:02:17.694]  I have a good friend who they put on Xanax.
[01:02:18.866 --> 01:02:22.609]  And he got pretty crazy on it, and it turned into a big national media circus.
[01:02:22.609 --> 01:02:23.469]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:02:23.469 --> 01:02:27.432]  People can probably figure out who I'm talking about.
[01:02:27.432 --> 01:02:29.274]  People are like, he's gone crazy.
[01:02:29.274 --> 01:02:32.396]  Yeah, get off the Xanax, no longer crazy.
[01:02:32.396 --> 01:02:36.459]  And a lot of people are like, oh, Xanax really is helping me.
[01:02:36.459 --> 01:02:38.981]  Yeah, but it's Russian roulette.
[01:02:41.519 --> 01:02:48.786]  It's Russian roulette, and we live in an unnatural society with GMO, chemicals, biologicals, all this in us, so we're already having enough problems.
[01:02:48.786 --> 01:02:53.089]  Then they say, well, we'll put you on these drugs so you don't notice it anymore.
[01:02:53.089 --> 01:02:55.632]  And then you don't have that normal
[01:02:59.111 --> 01:03:00.111]  Governor that's in you.
[01:03:00.111 --> 01:03:18.897]  That's what Prozac and this whole class of drugs do, is that a mother just suddenly, in a dream state, puts their children one after the other in the bathtub and holds them under until they die, and then dresses them and puts them in their beds, or drives them off a clip, or takes their babies and gets out a big butcher knife and chops their arms and legs off.
[01:03:18.897 --> 01:03:23.819]  And then calls the police and says, I just didn't know what to do except chop them up like a chicken.
[01:03:25.694 --> 01:03:29.236]  You know, church moms do it all the time now.
[01:03:29.236 --> 01:03:36.159]  My doctor put me on Prozac or Luvox and they pull up, the police pull up and there she is in her apron with a butcher knife.
[01:03:36.159 --> 01:03:38.801]  Hello officer, I'm ready to go now.
[01:03:38.801 --> 01:03:49.586]  And they're gonna send bails to prison instead of to a mental institution.
[01:03:51.482 --> 01:03:59.004]  I mean, have you slipped somebody three hits of LSD and they have a bad trip and go out and kill two or three people?
[01:03:59.004 --> 01:04:00.825]  And people find out that somebody spiked their drink?
[01:04:00.825 --> 01:04:02.125]  There's actually been cases of this.
[01:04:02.125 --> 01:04:04.786]  You don't even go to jail, folks!
[01:04:04.786 --> 01:04:11.668]  Because someone stuck in the bar LSD in your drink!
[01:04:11.668 --> 01:04:20.431]  But the system cannot let this guy go that shot the cop in the neck and killed him.
[01:04:21.601 --> 01:04:33.512]  And they can't let Sergeant Bales go because they can't indict the Prozac or the other psychotropics that they're on, Xanax.
[01:04:33.512 --> 01:04:37.255]  Because then, see it's always, why is everybody killing everybody?
[01:04:37.255 --> 01:04:39.457]  Well, we've got to put checkpoints everywhere to stop this.
[01:04:39.457 --> 01:04:41.179]  And the guys running the checkpoints are on the same drug.
[01:04:42.148 --> 01:04:46.131]  It's like, we don't know why breast cancer is so bad, we're not going to look at that, we'll just figure out how to cure it.
[01:04:46.131 --> 01:04:48.653]  Well, why is it getting, why is there so much more of it?
[01:04:48.653 --> 01:04:50.634]  It's like, why are people going crazy?
[01:04:50.634 --> 01:04:53.096]  Well, let's not look at that.
[01:04:53.096 --> 01:04:56.459]  Uh, let's just put them in jail.
[01:04:56.459 --> 01:04:57.480]  Okay, whatever.
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:58.480]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:01.789 --> 01:05:03.511]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.

[01:07:03.064 --> 01:07:08.367]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.

[01:07:45.117 --> 01:07:46.458]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:46.458 --> 01:07:48.499]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:12.094 --> 01:08:16.778]  Up at Infowars.com is our top story.
[01:08:16.778 --> 01:08:23.724]  Antidepressant drugs causing epidemic of mania, mayhem, and murder.
[01:08:23.724 --> 01:08:26.247]  A gentleman
[01:08:28.371 --> 01:08:33.895]  Shot a police officer who responded to a routine call last Thursday night.
[01:08:33.895 --> 01:08:35.536]  I mentioned this on air.
[01:08:35.536 --> 01:08:44.362]  And by the time I got off air, the Austin American Statesman in the afternoon had talked to his roommate and confirmed he was on Paxil and drank alcohol.
[01:08:44.362 --> 01:08:46.484]  And of course, what is the side effect of that?
[01:08:46.484 --> 01:08:48.946]  Violent tendencies, big time.
[01:08:48.946 --> 01:08:57.632]  And if you scroll down into the comments on InfoWars.com, he says, once upon a time, my doctor set me up with SSRIs to combat hypertension.
[01:09:01.653 --> 01:09:09.779]  And again, this is a comment I'm reading on Infowars.com about Paxil in a separate case.
[01:09:09.779 --> 01:09:16.784]  It was about two years ago, took my Paxil that morning, and later that night I drank a glass of wine.
[01:09:16.784 --> 01:09:18.625]  It was about 10 p.m.
[01:09:18.625 --> 01:09:24.529]  when I was told that I armed myself with a rifle and went for a walk in a neighborhood.
[01:09:24.529 --> 01:09:25.410]  Later the police came.
[01:09:25.410 --> 01:09:28.072]  I was surrounded by 12 or so cops, so I'm told.
[01:09:28.072 --> 01:09:30.274]  The cops tried to arrest me, but I told them
[01:09:30.994 --> 01:09:35.658]  I ranted and raved about everything and anything for about half an hour, ignoring the cops and the guns.
[01:09:35.658 --> 01:09:37.140]  They were pointing at me.
[01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:39.122]  I was violently arrested.
[01:09:39.122 --> 01:09:42.885]  A few hours later, I woke up at a hospital, handcuffed to the bed.
[01:09:42.885 --> 01:09:44.627]  Paxil caused this behavior.
[01:09:44.627 --> 01:09:47.469]  I have very little memory of that night at all.
[01:09:47.469 --> 01:09:51.893]  I have permanent physical injuries as a result of the violent arrest.
[01:09:51.893 --> 01:09:54.156]  Take it from someone who's been there, don't ever
[01:09:54.676 --> 01:09:56.997]  Put an SSRI in your body.
[01:09:56.997 --> 01:09:57.858]  And that's true.
[01:09:57.858 --> 01:10:00.759]  And if you are already on them, you have to go off very slowly.
[01:10:00.759 --> 01:10:08.243]  That's the number one thing that causes the total violent mania-cuckoo behavior, is to go off them quickly.
[01:10:08.243 --> 01:10:09.363]  Whoa!
[01:10:09.363 --> 01:10:14.446]  Do not go off the medication cold turkey, whatever you do.
[01:10:14.446 --> 01:10:17.267]  This isn't like kicking a coffee and you just get a headache.
[01:10:17.267 --> 01:10:19.448]  Or stopping drinking booze and you get a headache.
[01:10:19.448 --> 01:10:20.089]  This is
[01:10:21.874 --> 01:10:23.415]  Crazy person time.
[01:10:23.415 --> 01:10:26.716]  Anyways, I was reading a comment from that article.
[01:10:26.716 --> 01:10:30.117]  Anti-depressant drugs causing epidemic of mania, mayhem, and murder.
[01:10:30.117 --> 01:10:34.459]  America's addiction to dangerous SSRIs hits crisis level.
[01:10:34.459 --> 01:10:38.180]  The alleged shooting of a police officer in Austin.
[01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:39.900]  The guys are so careful to say alleged.
[01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:40.741]  It's on video.
[01:10:40.741 --> 01:10:43.122]  It's him.
[01:10:43.122 --> 01:10:43.842]  It's the shooting.
[01:10:43.842 --> 01:10:45.663]  The cop was shot.
[01:10:45.663 --> 01:10:46.443]  I wrote this with Paul.
[01:10:46.443 --> 01:10:47.843]  We probably need to change that.
[01:10:47.843 --> 01:10:48.764]  The alleged shooting.
[01:10:48.764 --> 01:10:49.464]  No, he was shot.
[01:10:52.049 --> 01:11:09.142]  Of a police officer in Austin by a man taking the anti-anxiety drug Xanax is just one of a plethora of recent incidents fueled by antidepressant pharmaceuticals, an epidemic of mania that has swept the country and the world, everywhere this happens.
[01:11:13.035 --> 01:11:26.597]  Mary O'Dell, the mother of 24-year-old Brandon Montgomery Daniel, told the Associated Press that her son's role in the fatal shooting of Austin senior police officer Jamie Padron was fueled by alcohol and
[01:11:27.842 --> 01:11:45.069]  Psychotropic drugs and she went on to break it down and we have all the other examples and you have bail so they won't release it but they're saying the treatment he was under it was clearly on Prozac or hiding those records and it's got all the other shooting examples in the article where it's been that you can just scroll through it all and read it for yourself.
[01:11:45.069 --> 01:11:52.131]  Everybody knows this but look at this article.
[01:11:52.131 --> 01:11:53.392]  Look at this article right here.
[01:11:55.754 --> 01:12:00.737]  A fog of drugs and war, Los Angeles Times.
[01:12:00.737 --> 01:12:06.940]  More than 110,000 active duty Army troops last year took antidepressants.
[01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:21.327]  And it just goes on to talk about all these pilots, all these military police, all these people with no criminal record, great service records, doing horrible things, assaulting people, attacking people, going crazy, killing people.
[01:12:22.826 --> 01:12:23.806]  Well, yeah.
[01:12:23.806 --> 01:12:33.308]  The worst idea in the world is to take trained killers, like Sergeant Bales, and put him on a serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
[01:12:33.308 --> 01:12:35.288]  And then he just breaks down.
[01:12:35.288 --> 01:12:51.651]  This is a guy who'd already been in four tours, had part of his foot blown off before, asked to not be sent back, had been in treatment at the military base in Oregon, and then was told he was okay, and sent back into Afghanistan, and he's there a few weeks, and his buddies
[01:12:57.918 --> 01:13:08.264]  His buddies get blown up in an armored vehicle and then he goes crazy and goes out and shoots a bunch of people, reportedly.
[01:13:08.264 --> 01:13:11.285]  His lawyer's not, right now, not even really denying he did it.
[01:13:11.285 --> 01:13:17.609]  I mean, the point is that no one is discussing the drugs, except for the LA Times.
[01:13:17.609 --> 01:13:19.630]  In fact, that's actually something I can say.
[01:13:19.630 --> 01:13:20.751]  I mean, here's the article right here.
[01:13:20.751 --> 01:13:24.473]  A fog of drugs and war.
[01:13:26.619 --> 01:13:33.289]  And it goes over all of that and gives you in five pages a bunch of examples of it.
[01:13:33.289 --> 01:13:36.093]  That's in the Los Angeles Times.
[01:13:36.093 --> 01:13:39.238]  Today.
[01:13:39.238 --> 01:13:40.039]  If you want to go read it.
[01:13:43.573 --> 01:13:51.360]  Okay, let me now go ahead and shift gears into some other areas, but everyone's welcome to call in about any of the subjects I've raised.
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:14:01.028]  So far, any of the issues I'm about to get to, the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:14:01.028 --> 01:14:10.357]  Coming up at the start of the third hour, I'm going to air video and audio of the new Black Panther Party calling for blood on the streets and mass race war.
[01:14:12.353 --> 01:14:14.194]  And again, we have the video.
[01:14:14.194 --> 01:14:19.715]  We're going to get it posted at Infowars.com, an article we already have up there.
[01:14:19.715 --> 01:14:24.417]  But this one is a family-friendly that has cut out all of the profanity.
[01:14:24.417 --> 01:14:30.979]  The issue is, is that the Hatari militia simply said,
[01:14:32.381 --> 01:14:35.842]  If the government comes to confiscate our guns, we're going to have to fight back.
[01:14:35.842 --> 01:14:37.983]  And gee, we hope it doesn't come to that.
[01:14:37.983 --> 01:14:42.505]  And they were arrested and held for years, and the judges said they're not guilty, release them.
[01:14:42.505 --> 01:14:43.825]  But the feds, of course, aren't doing that.
[01:14:43.825 --> 01:14:48.987]  They're holding them on weapons charges, which are legal guns, but they're saying guns are the commission of a crime.
[01:14:48.987 --> 01:14:58.070]  So the charges have been thrown out for the other crime, but they're saying the guns in the commission of that crime, they're going to be held for that.
[01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:59.811]  Just like the Davidians were found in the
[01:15:02.344 --> 01:15:06.508]  Appeals process, even the Supreme Court said release them.
[01:15:06.508 --> 01:15:11.052]  They're found not guilty of murdering federal police officers.
[01:15:11.052 --> 01:15:17.819]  And the Fed still held them on using firearms in the commission of murdering, killing federal police.
[01:15:18.809 --> 01:15:21.871]  But they were found not guilty of murdering.
[01:15:21.871 --> 01:15:24.012]  So it's the same thing.
[01:15:24.012 --> 01:15:32.337]  But you notice, somebody who's for the Constitution, Bill of Rights, who isn't racist, the Atari weren't into race stuff, they go to jail.
[01:15:32.337 --> 01:15:45.605]  But I've seen the new Black Panthers in Houston, the new Black Panthers in Chicago, the new Black Panthers in D.C., in Baltimore, on video, say, we're going to kill all the white people.
[01:15:45.605 --> 01:15:47.706]  And we want to start murdering and shooting them right now.
[01:15:50.461 --> 01:15:51.762]  Now, why aren't they being arrested?
[01:15:51.762 --> 01:15:56.407]  Because they'll normally arrest a black guy for walking down the street, walking while black.
[01:15:56.407 --> 01:15:58.949]  They throw the book at black people like nobody I've seen.
[01:15:58.949 --> 01:15:59.209]  Why?
[01:15:59.209 --> 01:16:03.733]  Because they want this race war to start, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:03.733 --> 01:16:08.097]  Where is the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL to decry them and say they're calling for violence?
[01:16:08.097 --> 01:16:12.121]  I mean, they're always saying I'm calling for violence when I'm not.
[01:16:12.121 --> 01:16:15.084]  They're always saying I'm going to cause violence when I'm not.
[01:16:16.676 --> 01:16:20.358]  It's not going to help us defeat the New World Order if every cop in America got a bullet between their eyes.
[01:16:20.358 --> 01:16:22.960]  In fact, it would help the New World Order.
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:24.761]  I'm not calling for killing police.
[01:16:24.761 --> 01:16:26.022]  I'm calling for the opposite.
[01:16:26.022 --> 01:16:33.807]  I'm not calling for bloodbaths and killing citizens and let's send a 10,000 man group to arrest George Zimmerman.
[01:16:37.321 --> 01:16:45.424]  It's pretty amazing what they say about, you know, we need to kill the whites and have race war and blood and all this, and it's just incredible.
[01:16:45.424 --> 01:16:51.606]  So that's coming up in the next hour.
[01:16:51.606 --> 01:16:56.468]  I've got some bad news here.
[01:16:56.468 --> 01:17:01.570]  Last week, Tuesday or so, they announced that they were going to pull the U.S.
[01:17:01.570 --> 01:17:05.652]  aircraft carriers out of the Gulf.
[01:17:07.011 --> 01:17:15.157]  The Persian Gulf, and that Israel was going to stop or scale back internal low-intensity conflict, they call it, inside Iran.
[01:17:15.157 --> 01:17:17.559]  That's warfare, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:17:17.559 --> 01:17:20.421]  Anybody does that to us, we call it terrorism.
[01:17:20.421 --> 01:17:24.744]  And Watson wrote the article saying, last aircraft carrier leaving.
[01:17:24.744 --> 01:17:27.846]  Well, that was all a ruse.
[01:17:27.846 --> 01:17:34.651]  They had another aircraft carrier show up, two aircraft carriers leave, and now all three are going in.
[01:17:34.651 --> 01:17:35.792]  And everything's on full alert.
[01:17:37.793 --> 01:17:40.774]  Just like they told Assad, OK, cease fire.
[01:17:40.774 --> 01:17:44.636]  Our peaceful activists will stop blowing up police stations and rocket attacking.
[01:17:44.636 --> 01:17:48.518]  And as soon as Assad stood down, they just launched attacks with U.S.
[01:17:48.518 --> 01:17:51.399]  and Israeli and British forces backing them.
[01:17:51.399 --> 01:17:53.900]  Not even so much Israeli, but they're somewhat involved.
[01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:55.601]  They're really involved in the Libya thing.
[01:17:55.601 --> 01:17:58.202]  Attacking from all angles.
[01:17:58.202 --> 01:17:59.103]  It's pure deception.
[01:18:01.732 --> 01:18:06.898]  The problem is if you ever actually want to make a deal with somebody, they won't listen to you.
[01:18:06.898 --> 01:18:12.626]  The globalists don't even do stuff that's honorable when it would serve them.
[01:18:12.626 --> 01:18:13.987]  You've got to say they are true to their...
[01:18:15.049 --> 01:18:16.750]  They're bad character.
[01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:17.130]  U.S.
[01:18:17.130 --> 01:18:19.531]  Navy deploys second aircraft carrier to the Gulf.
[01:18:19.531 --> 01:18:23.133]  And there's another just down south of that, not technically in it.
[01:18:23.133 --> 01:18:23.494]  The U.S.
[01:18:23.494 --> 01:18:30.357]  Navy said Monday it has deployed a second aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf amid rising tension with Iran over its disputed nuclear program.
[01:18:30.357 --> 01:18:35.300]  So they were announcing they were pulling out to one left the area, another was there, now another's going in.
[01:18:36.837 --> 01:18:48.585]  The deployment of the nuclear-powered USS Enterprise, along with the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group, marks only the fourth time in the past decade the Navy has had two aircraft carriers operating at the same time in the Persian Gulf.
[01:18:49.574 --> 01:18:56.658]  And the Arabian Sea, said the Commander Amy Derrick Frost of the Bahrain-based Fifth Fleet.
[01:18:56.658 --> 01:19:04.322]  The two carriers will support the American military operations in Afghanistan and anti-piracy efforts off Somali coast and the Gulf of Aden, she said.
[01:19:04.322 --> 01:19:05.782]  Yeah, right.
[01:19:05.782 --> 01:19:15.147]  And it goes on to, they've got a carrier in the Med and another out there in the larger sea below there.
[01:19:15.147 --> 01:19:16.748]  So all of that's going on right now.
[01:19:20.908 --> 01:19:30.714]  Okay, when we get back, I'm going to start going to phone calls for a while, and then I'll get into Melinda Gates worrying about population control critics.
[01:19:30.714 --> 01:19:36.757]  Also, study EPA-approved GMO insecticide responsible for killing off bees, contaminating entire food chain.
[01:19:36.757 --> 01:19:43.101]  Genocide-endorsing climate alarmist, one of the top guys at NASA, calls for global tax on carbon emissions.
[01:19:43.101 --> 01:19:46.963]  NASA's James Hansen previously advocated environmental terrorism.
[01:19:48.482 --> 01:19:56.406]  And that integrates in with this other huge report on MIT saying they're going to collapse the economy and kill 90% of the public.
[01:19:56.406 --> 01:19:57.506]  I'm not kidding.
[01:19:57.506 --> 01:19:58.407]  It's all out in the open.
[01:19:58.407 --> 01:19:58.827]  Stay with us.
[01:20:00.928 --> 01:20:09.591]  I'd seen the Longevity products work for many others, and so I bought a bunch of them, started using them, had a little bit of results, but I wasn't following the regimen every day.
[01:20:09.591 --> 01:20:13.812]  But Aaron Dykes in my office did, and lost more than 60 pounds.
[01:20:13.812 --> 01:20:17.533]  When I saw those results, I said, I better follow my own advice.
[01:20:17.533 --> 01:20:21.014]  I started taking the Longevity products, and it's been incredible.
[01:20:21.014 --> 01:20:23.635]  37 pounds in two months.
[01:20:23.635 --> 01:20:26.876]  Our bodies are amazing, and God gave us an incredible gift.
[01:20:27.116 --> 01:20:35.981]  But if our body doesn't have the tools it needs, all of the vitamins, all of the minerals, and the other key essential trace elements, we're not going to be healthy.
[01:20:35.981 --> 01:20:37.202]  Folks, this isn't hype.
[01:20:37.202 --> 01:20:41.445]  I only bring to my listeners products that I've tried myself and I truly believe in.

[01:24:30.277 --> 01:24:34.681]  If you've studied history, mass murder, huge empires, total control is the norm, not the exception.
[01:24:44.375 --> 01:24:50.479]  Everything we talk about on this broadcast is pretty frightening and incredible, but it's all backed up in fact.
[01:24:50.479 --> 01:25:00.346]  I mean, again, MIT's come out with a big major prospectus study saying 90 plus percent population reduction will happen.
[01:25:00.346 --> 01:25:04.388]  I mean, we're talking about news off the charts.
[01:25:04.388 --> 01:25:12.213]  It doesn't get more prestigious than MIT at the heart of the scientific dictatorship, at the heart of DARPA.
[01:25:12.213 --> 01:25:12.694]  All of this.
[01:25:14.039 --> 01:25:16.160]  That's coming up.
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:17.541]  New Black Panther Party.
[01:25:17.541 --> 01:25:19.043]  This is just what we need.
[01:25:19.043 --> 01:25:23.265]  The globalists are attacking and killing everybody.
[01:25:23.265 --> 01:25:27.689]  I never hear the Black Panthers say, don't abort 52% of black babies.
[01:25:27.689 --> 01:25:31.291]  No, it's just too much fun to talk about killing whites all day.
[01:25:31.291 --> 01:25:32.192]  And that's the globalists.
[01:25:32.192 --> 01:25:33.753]  They've created the big prison culture.
[01:25:35.219 --> 01:25:39.083]  Where if you're white, you've got to go join the supremacist or basically get killed.
[01:25:39.083 --> 01:25:42.526]  If you're Hispanic, you've got to go join the Hispanic supremacist or get killed.
[01:25:42.526 --> 01:25:54.817]  If you're black, you've got to go join the black supremacist or get killed, basically, in the more serious pens, penitentiaries.
[01:25:54.817 --> 01:25:59.802]  And so you go in there for a minor crime or nonviolent crime, you come out in five years,
[01:26:03.257 --> 01:26:17.986]  With a degree in criminality and you can't get jobs regular places, so you work for the criminal underground that works in most cases for the system.
[01:26:17.986 --> 01:26:20.467]  By the way, I want to say hi to Chuck Norris.
[01:26:20.467 --> 01:26:29.873]  He writes articles on a monthly basis for WorldNetDaily and quotes InfoWars.com and quotes Alex Jones here, yours truly.
[01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:37.696]  And sets the record straight, because we're on that daily written article saying, oh, this executive order for martial law is no big deal.
[01:26:37.696 --> 01:26:39.217]  We've always had this on the books.
[01:26:39.217 --> 01:26:47.925]  For a nuclear attack, if the Congress is all killed, not for something like
[01:26:48.956 --> 01:26:51.537]  The economic crisis or the threat of a crisis.
[01:26:51.537 --> 01:26:53.378]  And he points that out.
[01:26:53.378 --> 01:26:55.880]  And he also points out members of Congress saying it.
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:59.361]  And here's the Orlando Sentinel saying it.
[01:26:59.361 --> 01:27:02.683]  Orlando's rep, Adams, fears Obama power grab.
[01:27:02.683 --> 01:27:04.104]  I want to get Adams on.
[01:27:04.104 --> 01:27:05.244]  Word to the producer, please.
[01:27:05.244 --> 01:27:07.325]  Thank you.
[01:27:07.325 --> 01:27:13.288]  Another congressperson we had.
[01:27:13.288 --> 01:27:15.549]  We had that congressman from North Carolina on.
[01:27:15.549 --> 01:27:16.170]  What, Jones?
[01:27:17.549 --> 01:27:21.555]  About this a few weeks ago, who's standing up to it.
[01:27:21.555 --> 01:27:23.758]  So, this is real.
[01:27:23.758 --> 01:27:28.204]  People are like, oh, there's been executive orders for the government to take over everything since 1950.
[01:27:28.204 --> 01:27:29.846]  Yeah, in a nuclear war.
[01:27:31.485 --> 01:27:37.128]  Not for any crises, including the threat of a crisis, including economic or otherwise.
[01:27:37.128 --> 01:27:40.490]  This is not something that's been on the books a long time.
[01:27:40.490 --> 01:27:42.170]  This is new.
[01:27:42.170 --> 01:27:44.712]  Just like NDAA is new to secretly arrest us.
[01:27:44.712 --> 01:27:47.373]  Just like the torture's new in the last two administrations.
[01:27:47.373 --> 01:27:49.774]  Just like the secret arrest is new.
[01:27:49.774 --> 01:27:56.418]  Just like all these wars without congressional approval is new.
[01:27:56.418 --> 01:28:00.500]  And by the way, to Chuck Norris's... I said I'd cover it later, I'm just covering it now.
[01:28:01.553 --> 01:28:12.461]  To his credit, he goes on to say, yes, Bush engaged in imperial expansion behavior and power grabbing that was wrong, but Obama is focusing this in domestically.
[01:28:12.461 --> 01:28:14.583]  To paraphrase Chuck Norris, you can go read it.
[01:28:14.583 --> 01:28:15.724]  He's absolutely dead on.
[01:28:15.724 --> 01:28:28.894]  I know Chuck, when I first interviewed him, I don't know, six, seven years ago, said he'd been a listener for, since the mid-90s.
[01:28:28.894 --> 01:28:31.236]  He's got several ranches in Texas.
[01:28:32.987 --> 01:28:49.153]  And then, I've interviewed him quite a few times, and then, of course, we got his phone number once, and a previous producer years ago, I guess, or I didn't or something get it in the computer properly, and now the email I have doesn't work.
[01:28:49.153 --> 01:28:52.394]  So, word out to Chuck Morris, we'd like to get you back on the show.
[01:28:52.394 --> 01:29:01.518]  Chuck, I know you're a listener, and I appreciate you standing up and pointing out this is a power grab, but it's not just Chuck here, because we had a bunch of neocon sites come out and say, everything's fine.
[01:29:02.668 --> 01:29:11.434]  Sure, Obama says he can basically suspend Congress and take over resources and all this for the threat of a crisis, but that's no big deal.
[01:29:11.434 --> 01:29:11.854]  Oh, really?
[01:29:11.854 --> 01:29:16.658]  Well, Congressman Jones isn't listening, and Congressman Adams knows what's going on.
[01:29:16.658 --> 01:29:19.360]  Orlando reps Adams fears Obama power grab.
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:26.284]  A White House order updating federal emergency powers has raised alarm among some conservative commentators.
[01:29:26.284 --> 01:29:26.645]  The U.S.
[01:29:26.645 --> 01:29:28.026]  Representative Sandy Adams
[01:29:29.810 --> 01:29:34.813]  The President Obama is attempting to grab unconstitutional powers and it goes through that.
[01:29:34.813 --> 01:29:36.815]  Okay, that's coming up later, I promise.
[01:29:36.815 --> 01:29:39.156]  Your phone call's coming up.
[01:29:39.156 --> 01:29:45.681]  Then we'll get into... Government surveillance crackdown on the internet goes into overdrive.
[01:29:45.681 --> 01:29:49.983]  That's up at DrugsReport.com right now.
[01:29:49.983 --> 01:29:51.384]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.384 --> 01:29:53.906]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.906 --> 01:29:56.588]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.825 --> 01:30:08.048]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:30:08.048 --> 01:30:25.937]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:30:25.937 --> 01:30:30.059]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[01:30:30.319 --> 01:30:32.100]  And discovered Young Jevity.
[01:30:32.100 --> 01:30:40.266]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[01:30:40.266 --> 01:30:46.570]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[01:30:46.570 --> 01:30:47.851]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:30:47.851 --> 01:30:48.731]  It's incredible.
[01:30:48.731 --> 01:30:57.938]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[01:30:57.938 --> 01:30:59.779]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:02.021]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:02.021 --> 01:31:07.606]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:31:07.606 --> 01:31:12.632]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:31:12.632 --> 01:31:13.112]  It's true.
[01:31:13.112 --> 01:31:15.915]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:31:15.915 --> 01:31:17.677]  And it's possible that it could even happen again.
[01:31:18.197 --> 01:31:23.421]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:31:23.421 --> 01:31:25.742]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:31:25.742 --> 01:31:30.545]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:31:30.545 --> 01:31:31.666]  And here's the best part.
[01:31:31.666 --> 01:31:34.728]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:31:34.728 --> 01:31:38.351]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:31:38.351 --> 01:31:41.533]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:31:41.533 --> 01:31:43.754]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:31:43.754 --> 01:31:44.695]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:31:48.317 --> 01:31:52.560]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:57.384]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:31:57.384 --> 01:32:01.266]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:01.266 --> 01:32:15.717]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:32:16.724 --> 01:32:21.426]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:21.426 --> 01:32:34.190]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:32:34.190 --> 01:32:41.453]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:32:42.153 --> 01:32:52.526]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:32:52.526 --> 01:32:56.451]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:32:56.451 --> 01:32:59.575]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:33:02.518 --> 01:33:04.221]  Big Brother.
[01:33:04.221 --> 01:33:06.544]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:06.544 --> 01:33:08.326]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:08.326 --> 01:33:10.429]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:10.429 --> 01:33:12.572]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:12.572 --> 01:33:17.198]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:27.034 --> 01:33:28.576]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:28.576 --> 01:33:42.254]  You know, I think it's a pretty big deal that the ruling elite are eugenicists who have disdain for humanity and who openly want to reduce population by more than 90% and now the top research team at MIT officially
[01:33:43.075 --> 01:33:49.301]  Is projecting, we just did the math back there, a 96% population reduction.
[01:33:49.301 --> 01:33:52.104]  People are always, what is it?
[01:33:52.104 --> 01:33:52.124]  80?
[01:33:52.124 --> 01:33:52.584]  90?
[01:33:52.584 --> 01:33:56.328]  You get your facts, Mr. Baloney man, get them right!
[01:33:56.328 --> 01:33:59.831]  I'm like, well the UN says 80, and the Biological Diversity Assessment, 1996.
[01:34:01.624 --> 01:34:02.786]  The unredacted full one.
[01:34:02.786 --> 01:34:04.448]  You gotta go to the library for it.
[01:34:04.448 --> 01:34:06.231]  Club of Rome says 80.
[01:34:06.231 --> 01:34:07.593]  Jacques Cousteau said 80.
[01:34:07.593 --> 01:34:09.516]  Ted Turner says 90.
[01:34:09.516 --> 01:34:11.279]  Prince Philip says 90.
[01:34:11.279 --> 01:34:14.704]  In most documents, in the old days it was 80%.
[01:34:14.704 --> 01:34:16.687]  Now they put out reports saying they want to kill 99% of us.
[01:34:18.801 --> 01:34:21.222]  Some reports say they may kill themselves!
[01:34:21.222 --> 01:34:22.662]  The humans are so evil.
[01:34:22.662 --> 01:34:25.623]  It's like, I hate humanity so bad, I'm killing myself!
[01:34:25.623 --> 01:34:34.045]  You know, that's the... You're like, that doesn't make any sense, because you're not the type of person that likes injecting newborns with cancer viruses.
[01:34:34.045 --> 01:34:36.625]  I mean, you're just, you don't get it.
[01:34:36.625 --> 01:34:38.046]  You're not like Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:34:39.042 --> 01:34:57.350]  When I was doing research on him for my film Martial Law, because he's part of the film, and they were pushing him for president, just how disgusting that was, is that his favorite artist, because it showed him visiting him in Germany, is a guy that shows little kids killed in car wrecks, and then like seven-year-old girls dressed in Nazi uniforms laying out on beds.
[01:34:57.350 --> 01:35:01.291]  I mean, they're dressed, but it's like, you know, super creepy.
[01:35:01.291 --> 01:35:04.613]  And you see all the Ralph Lauren and all them have run
[01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:12.321]  Ad campaigns, you know, and well, there's some that are even worse than what Ralph Lauren did mildly years ago, or was it Calvin Klein?
[01:35:12.321 --> 01:35:14.242]  I forget.
[01:35:14.242 --> 01:35:19.703]  And you're like, why would anyone want a year old baby run over by a truck, a photograph of that?
[01:35:19.703 --> 01:35:22.884]  You know, it's head all smashed, eyeballs hanging out.
[01:35:22.884 --> 01:35:30.045]  Schwarzenegger gets on a private jet and flies to Europe to stare at this and buy it.
[01:35:33.666 --> 01:35:35.547]  There's your answer, okay?
[01:35:35.547 --> 01:35:36.528]  And that's part of the course.
[01:35:36.528 --> 01:35:39.350]  If you look in the New York Times, they've done reports on it.
[01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:55.201]  The most popular art in New York, bought by the rich Wall Street people, is a flask, a gold-lined jar, crystal jar, with semen and blood in it.
[01:35:55.201 --> 01:35:58.062]  I hate to get gross, this is who rules things.
[01:35:58.062 --> 01:36:00.104]  And they'll pay $15 million for that.
[01:36:01.038 --> 01:36:01.819]  And they ask him why.
[01:36:01.819 --> 01:36:04.742]  They say it is a commitment to this.
[01:36:04.742 --> 01:36:07.584]  It's an offering.
[01:36:07.584 --> 01:36:18.415]  And the artists are always, you know, self-mutilating with weird black spiked hair and totally white and think they're vampires.
[01:36:18.415 --> 01:36:19.776]  What is that article you guys pulled up?
[01:36:19.776 --> 01:36:20.056]  Let me see.
[01:36:21.041 --> 01:36:24.042]  Arnold Schwarzenegger hands back Nazi loot.
[01:36:24.042 --> 01:36:25.322]  No, that's not it.
[01:36:25.322 --> 01:36:26.183]  That's not it.
[01:36:26.183 --> 01:36:29.504]  That's just some other, some other thing he's up to.
[01:36:29.504 --> 01:36:33.345]  You love Kurt Voltheim, one of the top Nazis.
[01:36:33.345 --> 01:36:40.328]  The point is, is that I remember it was like $47 million for a skull encrusted with diamonds.
[01:36:40.328 --> 01:36:49.671]  Or, you know, a million and a half dollars for a crucifix submerged in pus with a garnish of maggots.
[01:36:50.779 --> 01:36:55.002]  I mean, these are real things, and they go and fight with each other bidding over it.
[01:36:55.002 --> 01:37:04.247]  So up in their giant, you know, $50 million high-rise, you know, three-story-level penthouses with their models and everybody coming to visit them.
[01:37:04.247 --> 01:37:05.968]  I'm going to your calls in a moment.
[01:37:05.968 --> 01:37:11.612]  They can... I'll never forget, I was watching PBS with Jack Kevorkian before he went to prison.
[01:37:11.612 --> 01:37:17.135]  This has got to be 20 years ago, more than 20 years ago, because I was in high school.
[01:37:19.366 --> 01:37:21.047]  Hmm, do the math.
[01:37:21.047 --> 01:37:22.588]  That was about 21 years ago.
[01:37:22.588 --> 01:37:25.830]  I was a senior in high school at my parents' house.
[01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:43.882]  We moved here to Austin, and I'm watching PBS, and it's Jack Kevorkian, and it shows, at the New York art display, it shows all these movie stars and supermodels, and at the event, they cut to a shot of
[01:37:48.561 --> 01:37:50.682]  Who's the famous Scientologist?
[01:37:50.682 --> 01:37:51.962]  I'm drawing a blank here.
[01:37:51.962 --> 01:37:55.203]  Who's in Top Gun?
[01:37:55.203 --> 01:37:55.843]  Tom Cruise.
[01:37:55.843 --> 01:37:56.463]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:37:56.463 --> 01:37:57.403]  Tom Cruise.
[01:37:57.403 --> 01:38:02.885]  I start envisioning seeing that TV program and then I can't remember basic names because I'm accessing old memory.
[01:38:02.885 --> 01:38:10.827]  The point is, is that they're there and these women, these supermodels, are sitting there in Jack of Orchid, I'll never forget, was in this powder blue suit.
[01:38:11.747 --> 01:38:14.650]  With all these beautiful women around him like he was a rock star.
[01:38:14.650 --> 01:38:16.952]  But they understand, they don't like it.
[01:38:16.952 --> 01:38:20.636]  They have to worship it to be in those elite circles.
[01:38:20.636 --> 01:38:22.437]  It was all real fake.
[01:38:22.437 --> 01:38:26.722]  But it's about the worshipping of a weird, ghoulish man.
[01:38:26.722 --> 01:38:28.964]  And it was his art display.
[01:38:28.964 --> 01:38:31.566]  And he was... It was demons.
[01:38:32.765 --> 01:38:36.106]  Painted in his own blood as part of the medium.
[01:38:36.106 --> 01:38:40.488]  And it was like a baby coming out of a woman and the demons eating it.
[01:38:40.488 --> 01:38:43.269]  And just the most horrible stuff you can imagine.
[01:38:43.269 --> 01:38:49.611]  And there's all these supermodels going, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, with Jack Kevorkian.
[01:38:49.611 --> 01:38:54.233]  And him, this ghoulish, Crypt Keeper-type ghoul, nerd.
[01:38:55.814 --> 01:39:07.805]  Who's this civil rights person they're saying, going, I painted it with ampoules of my own blood, and smacking his lips, and the women going, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[01:39:07.805 --> 01:39:10.648]  This is who runs things, okay?
[01:39:10.648 --> 01:39:13.570]  And if you don't get that, you don't understand.
[01:39:13.570 --> 01:39:18.415]  They feel power when they think about your child injected with cancer viruses.
[01:39:19.386 --> 01:39:20.406]  I don't think Tom Cruise was.
[01:39:20.406 --> 01:39:24.788]  He was just on this newscast I saw, I guess, coming to the art display.
[01:39:24.788 --> 01:39:30.150]  Because I know, I'm not saying he's perfect, but he's spoken out against Prozac and stuff hurting your brain.
[01:39:30.150 --> 01:39:32.311]  The point is, is that this is what they do.
[01:39:32.311 --> 01:39:39.553]  They hop around at these events and all get off on the fact that they're into killing people and into death.
[01:39:39.553 --> 01:39:41.954]  I mean, look at this article at Infowars.com.
[01:39:41.954 --> 01:39:46.396]  Genocide endorsing climate alarmists calls for global tax on carbon emissions.
[01:39:47.372 --> 01:39:50.954]  He's the number three guy at NASA.
[01:39:50.954 --> 01:40:03.763]  He's their head climatologist over a bunch of the satellite systems, and he's always endorsing world government population control, a worldwide police state, drugs in the water, because he knows best.
[01:40:03.763 --> 01:40:08.786]  It's all about the power trip.
[01:40:08.786 --> 01:40:12.408]  See, if you really want to be on a power trip, you've got to be killing people.
[01:40:12.408 --> 01:40:14.150]  You've got to be cutting their food and water off.
[01:40:14.150 --> 01:40:15.751]  You've got to be making them take deadly shots.
[01:40:16.519 --> 01:40:17.980]  That's what the power is all about.
[01:40:17.980 --> 01:40:20.623]  It's about they got the power.
[01:40:20.623 --> 01:40:23.225]  They're way past swimming pools and supermodels.
[01:40:23.225 --> 01:40:28.710]  This is about cutting the power off, killing some people.
[01:40:28.710 --> 01:40:32.293]  This is about flying to Germany to
[01:40:35.239 --> 01:40:46.502]  In fact, we were doing days of searches for photos of Schwarzenegger, and we're able to dig up some of the real porno magazine covers, gay magazines that he was on the cover of and stuff, and we put some of those blurred out in martial law.
[01:40:46.502 --> 01:40:47.843]  You've seen it.
[01:40:47.843 --> 01:40:59.566]  And that's when we just came across Schwarzenegger at the, at visiting Germany and quote his favorite artist and photos of him and him there purchasing the art of the dead babies.
[01:41:02.247 --> 01:41:03.228]  That was on an old drive.
[01:41:03.228 --> 01:41:08.456]  That was six years ago we released that film, and I know Jacobson tried to find that drive and dig it out.
[01:41:08.456 --> 01:41:10.519]  But I'm telling you, listeners, you can dig that up.
[01:41:11.078 --> 01:41:13.439]  Do a blurb about it, we'll relink to it.
[01:41:13.439 --> 01:41:16.921]  People are always, oh yeah, where's this Jack Kevorkian art?
[01:41:16.921 --> 01:41:18.682]  Guys, type in the art of Jack Kevorkian.
[01:41:18.682 --> 01:41:20.263]  I don't think we've ever even done this.
[01:41:20.263 --> 01:41:22.404]  Let's see if it comes up.
[01:41:22.404 --> 01:41:24.124]  It's demons eating children, okay?
[01:41:24.124 --> 01:41:37.411]  I mean, oh, he wants to kill people because he cares about them and he gets them in his little minivan or his Volkswagen bus and gasses them or whatever and then reportedly would get all creamy-eyed and excited about it.
[01:41:39.107 --> 01:41:40.848]  You find anything under the artwork?
[01:41:40.848 --> 01:41:41.168]  You did?
[01:41:41.168 --> 01:41:43.148]  Put it up.
[01:41:43.148 --> 01:41:45.449]  People are always calling me saying, show us the proof.
[01:41:45.449 --> 01:41:47.189]  I don't make any of this up.
[01:41:47.189 --> 01:41:48.010]  Look it up for yourself.
[01:41:48.010 --> 01:41:48.770]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:41:48.770 --> 01:41:49.210]  There it was.
[01:41:49.210 --> 01:41:49.890]  Go back.
[01:41:49.890 --> 01:41:51.531]  There's a skull with a flower growing.
[01:41:51.531 --> 01:41:54.852]  There's a guy sliding down to hell.
[01:41:54.852 --> 01:41:57.252]  There's skeletons.
[01:41:57.252 --> 01:42:01.834]  There's, oh, there's a demon, a devil.
[01:42:01.834 --> 01:42:05.215]  There's a guy with his head cut off with an apple who's for dinner.
[01:42:07.225 --> 01:42:11.247]  There's a woman's head cut off by Nazis.
[01:42:11.247 --> 01:42:15.709]  There's a guy with his skin stripped off in hell.
[01:42:15.709 --> 01:42:18.710]  There's a... See, I'd never even thought... People just accuse me of making this up.
[01:42:18.710 --> 01:42:19.651]  There it is.
[01:42:19.651 --> 01:42:22.632]  Some of the artwork of Jack Kevorkian.
[01:42:24.383 --> 01:42:28.625]  And I guarantee you, if you work at PBS, you can dig up the reels of that.
[01:42:28.625 --> 01:42:39.389]  With these women, literally, hopping around, totally fake, going, I'm not exaggerating.
[01:42:39.389 --> 01:42:41.810]  And I, it was in deep searches.
[01:42:41.810 --> 01:42:45.491]  I was on like day two of searches, and Jacobson's sitting there wanting to edit.
[01:42:45.491 --> 01:42:47.452]  He's going, come on man, we got enough photos of this.
[01:42:47.452 --> 01:42:49.373]  I'm like, listen, we're going to find the gay porn.
[01:42:50.962 --> 01:42:52.963]  of Schwarzenegger.
[01:42:52.963 --> 01:42:59.248]  And he's like, he's like, I'm going out and getting something to eat because you imagine Schwarzenegger gay porn what's coming up.
[01:42:59.248 --> 01:43:04.111]  And I'm sitting there trying to and then all of a sudden it's Schwarzenegger with little girls and Nazi outfits.
[01:43:04.111 --> 01:43:08.494]  And I'm like, man, I really dislike this guy more than I disliked him before.
[01:43:10.421 --> 01:43:13.003]  The research I've got to do looking into these people.
[01:43:13.003 --> 01:43:21.230]  When I tell you the Rockefeller Foundation developed cancer viruses, I've given you the documents on the website to put in your shots, or sterile, and you better go look it up.
[01:43:21.230 --> 01:43:28.576]  If I tell you Jack Kevorkian paints babies being eaten by demons, type in Jack Kevorkian art, baby being eaten by a demon.
[01:43:28.576 --> 01:43:31.037]  In fact, we can't even put it on TV though.
[01:43:31.037 --> 01:43:35.541]  They put this on PBS because it was art, but I can't show this here.
[01:43:35.541 --> 01:43:38.804]  It's a baby coming out of a woman,
[01:43:40.216 --> 01:43:43.317]  With a demon leering about to eat it, which is abortion, of course.
[01:43:43.317 --> 01:43:49.218]  He's telling you, this is a hardcore sacrament for us.
[01:43:49.218 --> 01:43:51.819]  We're dealing with hell pit creatures.
[01:43:51.819 --> 01:43:53.700]  I don't know how else to explain it.
[01:43:53.700 --> 01:43:55.280]  And you're like, oh, it's not that bad.
[01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:56.480]  It's worse than I can say.
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:58.121]  Okay, I'm going to stop now.
[01:43:58.121 --> 01:44:03.922]  I'm going to take calls for about 20 minutes and then I'll get into the race war news and all the rest of it I haven't gotten into yet.
[01:44:03.922 --> 01:44:05.003]  Our story's up at Drudge Report.
[01:44:05.003 --> 01:44:05.963]  It's been up there over the weekend.
[01:44:05.963 --> 01:44:06.623]  It's very important.
[01:44:07.762 --> 01:44:09.002]  Government surveillance crackdown.
[01:44:09.002 --> 01:44:10.563]  Internet goes into overdrive.
[01:44:10.563 --> 01:44:13.304]  Cyber bills legislate for mass surveillance.
[01:44:13.304 --> 01:44:24.668]  Former cybersecurity czar calls for Homeland Security data custom inspection, where all of your data is searched and run through government databases.
[01:44:24.668 --> 01:44:25.908]  It was up higher on the weekend.
[01:44:25.908 --> 01:44:27.509]  It's now scrolled down some.
[01:44:27.509 --> 01:44:32.150]  There it is.
[01:44:32.150 --> 01:44:34.291]  Government surveillance crackdown on the Internet.
[01:44:35.609 --> 01:44:37.430]  Very important article.
[01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:41.573]  Stuff they said I was crazy seven, eight years ago talking about, now it's just all admitted.
[01:44:41.573 --> 01:44:46.316]  Okay, that said, let's go to Richard in Kansas.
[01:44:46.316 --> 01:44:47.317]  Richard, you're on the air.
[01:44:47.317 --> 01:44:47.737]  Go ahead.
[01:44:47.737 --> 01:44:52.100]  Yeah, just worst every morning, isn't it, Alex?
[01:44:52.100 --> 01:44:55.062]  Yeah, we're dealing with people that like to paint demons eating babies.
[01:44:55.062 --> 01:44:57.263]  I mean, we're in deep trouble.
[01:44:57.263 --> 01:44:59.985]  Yeah, well, look at the people that go to Bohemian Grove, man.
[01:44:59.985 --> 01:45:01.646]  I mean, we're obviously dealing with sickos.
[01:45:03.783 --> 01:45:05.104]  Yeah, but they're artists.
[01:45:05.104 --> 01:45:10.668]  See, you just don't see the beauty of a child run over by a truck.
[01:45:10.668 --> 01:45:15.412]  Ah, that's the side effect of having more than two brain cells, Alex.
[01:45:15.412 --> 01:45:17.153]  Oh, but they're the leaders of our society.
[01:45:17.153 --> 01:45:20.055]  What's wrong with a child run over by a truck?
[01:45:20.055 --> 01:45:21.116]  It's beautiful.
[01:45:21.116 --> 01:45:21.916]  To Schwarzenegger.
[01:45:21.916 --> 01:45:23.838]  Their little smashed head.
[01:45:24.893 --> 01:45:29.096]  Oh, I know, I'm supposed to wish I had the money to buy these things.
[01:45:29.096 --> 01:45:30.978]  Yeah, you just don't get it, man.
[01:45:30.978 --> 01:45:35.581]  You need to buy a company up and fire all the employees and move it to China.
[01:45:35.581 --> 01:45:41.466]  And then ship poison goods back into America and feed kids in America melamine and have the media say it's good for them.
[01:45:41.466 --> 01:45:44.668]  That's what's pure and ethical.
[01:45:44.668 --> 01:45:49.211]  You need to pay millions of dollars for a plastic jug of maggots.
[01:45:49.211 --> 01:45:50.232]  That's beauty, man.
[01:45:50.232 --> 01:45:51.313]  You just don't see it.
[01:45:53.575 --> 01:45:54.715]  Do you want to apologize?
[01:45:54.715 --> 01:45:57.376]  Do you want to apologize to him right now?
[01:45:57.376 --> 01:45:59.096]  I'm so sorry, you know.
[01:45:59.096 --> 01:46:01.857]  I will apologize to the New World Order.
[01:46:01.857 --> 01:46:09.638]  I apologize that I don't see the beauty and the disgusting horror that you seem to enjoy so well.
[01:46:09.638 --> 01:46:10.278]  Well, there you go.
[01:46:10.278 --> 01:46:11.398]  An uncultured caller.
[01:46:11.398 --> 01:46:12.298]  What else, sir?
[01:46:12.298 --> 01:46:13.039]  You're not trendy.
[01:46:13.039 --> 01:46:15.559]  What else did you call about?
[01:46:15.559 --> 01:46:18.460]  Pretty much at this... I spoke with you this past Friday.
[01:46:18.460 --> 01:46:19.380]  I don't know if you remember.
[01:46:21.915 --> 01:46:29.698]  Uh, before we got cut off, I was actually going to let you know that pretty much at this point, um, there's nothing going on up here at this point in Kansas.
[01:46:29.698 --> 01:46:37.181]  And, um, we've sent you a few emails, um, we've also started a book and a documentary combination that we would also like to ask you to be a part of.
[01:46:37.181 --> 01:46:45.644]  Oh, you were the, uh, you're the, uh, you're the veteran and you said that people are like, if they see you wearing dog tags or any of your military jacket or anything, people are getting in your face?
[01:46:46.587 --> 01:46:51.430]  Yeah, it's pretty much best to either just stay in or not wear it at this point, yeah.
[01:46:51.430 --> 01:46:55.253]  Alright, well we're in the process of hiring reporters, two of them.
[01:46:55.253 --> 01:47:11.424]  We're running a contest, and I appreciate your call, sir, but that's how people who want, because I'm getting all these calls behind the scenes, people are delivering, you know, their old work here, and they're saying, hire me, here's work I did as a reporter two years ago, and I'm like, it's through the contest.
[01:47:11.424 --> 01:47:14.766]  It's not fair to hire people who at least don't try to go through the contest.
[01:47:15.333 --> 01:47:20.535]  And there's $5,000 for one reporter and $5,000 for the other, a male and female reporter.
[01:47:20.535 --> 01:47:23.516]  Two winners!

[01:47:25.476 --> 01:47:27.157]  What's the actual URL of that?

[01:47:32.819 --> 01:47:38.741]  Or just type in InfoWars Reporter Contest into the NSA search engine.
[01:47:38.741 --> 01:47:42.262]  So InfoWars.com forward slash reporter dash contest.
[01:47:43.001 --> 01:47:45.082]  That's where it is, thank you.
[01:47:45.082 --> 01:47:46.863]  John in Ohio, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:47:46.863 --> 01:47:50.745]  Hey Alex, it's good to talk to you.
[01:47:50.745 --> 01:47:56.048]  I think we're inside some kind of mass psyop here, and I remember this.
[01:47:56.048 --> 01:48:01.211]  This took place about 13 years ago, back during the Kosovo incident with Bill Clinton.
[01:48:01.211 --> 01:48:08.135]  One morning, I think it was on the Good Morning America, I was at the house with my mother, and I got up and showed this picture.
[01:48:08.135 --> 01:48:11.117]  It said, two Kosovars in a prison camp.
[01:48:11.886 --> 01:48:22.172]  And the picture was actually a picture taken 40 years ago of two Jewish men looking out of a concentration camp during World War II in their night shirts.
[01:48:22.172 --> 01:48:25.834]  And I looked at my mother and I said, look, I got a book in here, World War II in color.
[01:48:25.834 --> 01:48:26.354]  No, that's right.
[01:48:26.354 --> 01:48:29.496]  They showed fake photos saying the Serbs had done it.
[01:48:29.496 --> 01:48:31.777]  And it was color photos of people at a camp.
[01:48:31.777 --> 01:48:33.458]  And then they also, that got caught.
[01:48:33.458 --> 01:48:40.482]  They staged a shot of a man with tuberculosis and had him come to one of the UN facilities that had the food behind wires and said that was the case.
[01:48:40.962 --> 01:48:49.646]  NBC got caught editing the tape to have George Zimmerman, you know, making it sound like, yeah, he looks like he's up to no good because he's black.
[01:48:49.646 --> 01:48:52.167]  And the real tape is they're like, sir, what color is he?
[01:48:52.167 --> 01:48:52.927]  Does he look black?
[01:48:52.927 --> 01:48:53.507]  Hispanic?
[01:48:53.507 --> 01:48:54.447]  White?
[01:48:54.447 --> 01:48:56.408]  He looks black.
[01:48:56.408 --> 01:49:00.530]  Yeah, he's looking at, you know, he's looking in things, doing things, acting like he's on drugs or up to no good.
[01:49:00.530 --> 01:49:02.130]  They edit it together like, yeah, he's black.
[01:49:02.130 --> 01:49:04.191]  He's up to no good because he's black.
[01:49:04.191 --> 01:49:05.692]  I mean, I mean, this is what they do.
[01:49:07.512 --> 01:49:10.193]  Alex, I got this old book here I bought back in 96.
[01:49:10.193 --> 01:49:12.594]  It was by a man named Thomas Chittum.
[01:49:12.594 --> 01:49:14.856]  Civil War II, the coming breakup of America.
[01:49:14.856 --> 01:49:21.199]  And I remember when I got it, I read through it and I told some people, my family about it, and they said, you're crazy.
[01:49:21.199 --> 01:49:28.722]  Everything this man said in this book about racial separate groups, mass riots for days and days.
[01:49:28.722 --> 01:49:32.444]  Yeah, by the way, I want to carry that book and I want him on the show.
[01:49:32.444 --> 01:49:34.025]  He's still around, isn't he?
[01:49:34.025 --> 01:49:36.306]  I'm not sure, but I will say this.
[01:49:36.306 --> 01:49:36.666]  I think
[01:49:37.284 --> 01:49:55.794]  There's a guy that comes on George Norris shows sometimes he talks about microwave attack through radio waves and you know I I kind of wonder about this because I have epileptic seizures and neurological disorders are off the chart mainly from the chemicals but it's also frequency pollution.
[01:49:55.794 --> 01:50:03.458]  Yeah frequency pollution this is what I was talking about is that I sometimes wonder if the things going on in this country with murders and things
[01:50:03.999 --> 01:50:11.079]  Are not sometimes being started with this frequency pollution, because I'm going to tell you what, I mean we're just having strange things.
[01:50:13.278 --> 01:50:23.161]  They've got now close to 20% of the population, 10% of the military or more, are on psychotropics that cause you to not have impulse control.
[01:50:23.161 --> 01:50:28.482]  I mean, it's on the insert it causes violent attacks and murder and mayhem.
[01:50:28.482 --> 01:50:38.285]  And I mean, so, Bales was under psychiatric treatment, begged to not go back, was on drugs, but they won't release the details, and they're going to send him to prison when they put a trained killer on
[01:50:39.765 --> 01:50:42.028]  A drug that makes you go psycho.
[01:50:42.028 --> 01:50:48.634]  And I'm not saying that he's a perfect guy, but you can't put somebody on crazy drugs.
[01:50:48.634 --> 01:50:53.639]  The guy that shot the cop last week was in a Xanax fit that it causes.
[01:50:53.639 --> 01:50:57.243]  I mean, he was temporarily insane.
[01:50:57.243 --> 01:50:58.064]  Of course he was.
[01:50:59.229 --> 01:51:01.170]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:01.170 --> 01:51:08.311]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:51:08.311 --> 01:51:25.736]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:51:26.016 --> 01:51:32.142]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[01:51:32.142 --> 01:51:40.249]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[01:51:40.249 --> 01:51:43.292]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months.
[01:51:43.712 --> 01:51:46.473]  Simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[01:51:46.473 --> 01:51:47.734]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:51:47.734 --> 01:51:48.614]  It's incredible.

[01:51:57.718 --> 01:51:59.279]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[01:52:00.834 --> 01:52:06.178]  Do you know which 37 crucial food items are going to fly off the shelves when the next disaster hits?
[01:52:06.178 --> 01:52:12.583]  If you don't, you and your family may be without food and waiting in long food lines after a big disaster strikes!
[01:52:12.583 --> 01:52:17.406]  You would be surprised how many people don't have these food items right now!
[01:52:17.406 --> 01:52:20.969]  123survivalplan.com has set up a for patriots only video
[01:52:21.409 --> 01:52:27.052]  Inside information on the 37 food items that will sell out first when the next disaster strikes.

[01:52:41.159 --> 01:52:46.561]  See the video that over 1 million other smart patriots have already seen in the last 4 months.

[01:52:55.047 --> 01:52:56.788]  Again, that's 123survivalplan.com.
[01:53:02.708 --> 01:53:07.350]  Diesel owners, have you had enough of hard starts, poor mileage, and poor performance?
[01:53:07.350 --> 01:53:13.073]  The cause is stiction, a gummy residue that clings to injectors like cholesterol clings to arteries.
[01:53:13.073 --> 01:53:17.095]  Stiction robs your diesel engine of power, performance, and gas mileage.
[01:53:17.095 --> 01:53:19.095]  The answer, hot shot secret.
[01:53:19.095 --> 01:53:20.296]  This is Lee from Minnesota.
[01:53:20.296 --> 01:53:24.718]  I have a F-350 with a 6.0 diesel, and I had many injector problems and hard starting problems.
[01:53:24.938 --> 01:53:30.323]  After I added Hot Shot Secret, it now starts better, feels stronger, and my mileage went up 2 miles per gallon.
[01:53:30.323 --> 01:53:32.945]  I recommend Hot Shot Secret to anyone with a diesel engine.
[01:53:34.648 --> 01:53:39.911]  Hot Shot Secret, the only oil additive engineered to remove stiction in all diesel engines.
[01:53:39.911 --> 01:53:42.712]  Clean from the inside out with Hot Shot Secret.
[01:53:42.712 --> 01:53:46.114]  Available nationwide at all tractor supply stores.
[01:53:46.114 --> 01:53:46.714]  Or call 800-341-6516.
[01:53:46.714 --> 01:53:46.974]  That's 800-341-6516.
[01:53:46.974 --> 01:53:47.855]  Or go to hotshotsecret.com.
[01:53:47.855 --> 01:53:49.156]  Hot Shot Secret, powered by science!
[01:54:01.161 --> 01:54:01.802]  Yeah.
[01:54:10.586 --> 01:54:11.626]  By the way, uh...
[01:54:35.700 --> 01:54:41.764]  A bunch of the office is freaking out as they went and searched the term Jack Kevorkian art.
[01:54:41.764 --> 01:54:47.068]  And it's demons eating babies, people having their heads chopped up and eaten on banquet tables.
[01:54:47.068 --> 01:54:48.249]  I mean, that's what he was into.
[01:54:48.249 --> 01:54:50.671]  I'm not making this up.
[01:54:50.671 --> 01:54:59.177]  I mean, I went through the torture of searching out Schwarzenegger and his gay porn exploits.
[01:54:59.177 --> 01:55:00.738]  That's true too.
[01:55:00.738 --> 01:55:02.299]  That's why he's so easily blackmailed.
[01:55:03.123 --> 01:55:09.085]  And most of it is in a rich guy's private collection and has not been released.
[01:55:09.085 --> 01:55:13.467]  But the point is, any of this stuff I bring up is, it's all real.
[01:55:13.467 --> 01:55:19.729]  I mean, do you understand that when I tell you MIT says over 90% of us will be dead?
[01:55:19.729 --> 01:55:29.193]  That's an article in InfoWars.com with a link to the Smithsonian Institute, to the UN, to the Club of Rome, and to MIT.
[01:55:31.010 --> 01:55:33.972]  I mean, I understand this all sounds crazy.
[01:55:33.972 --> 01:55:34.912]  I got it.
[01:55:34.912 --> 01:55:35.613]  I get it.
[01:55:35.613 --> 01:55:36.613]  It's real.
[01:55:36.613 --> 01:55:38.494]  I'm not the one that's crazy.
[01:55:38.494 --> 01:55:43.177]  I'm the one marveling at it.
[01:55:43.177 --> 01:55:46.399]  And believe me, it's not fun searching out Schwarzenegger stuff.
[01:55:46.399 --> 01:55:53.343]  Like I said, I was looking for the porno magazines he was in and found him buying up art of kids run over by trucks.
[01:55:57.748 --> 01:56:04.572]  I mean, again, by the way, I've looked for that again and couldn't find it.
[01:56:04.572 --> 01:56:11.636]  And we didn't put it in the film just because it was just, it was like, and here's Schwarzenegger buying art of, you know, dead babies.
[01:56:11.636 --> 01:56:12.637]  The point is, it's out there.
[01:56:12.637 --> 01:56:13.397]  Somebody try to find it.
[01:56:13.397 --> 01:56:13.797]  It's hard.
[01:56:13.797 --> 01:56:16.579]  You can find the Kevorkian stuff in five seconds.
[01:56:16.579 --> 01:56:20.201]  Somebody find it, email us where it's at, because I want it on the show.
[01:56:20.201 --> 01:56:21.902]  If it comes in today, I'll show it.
[01:56:23.639 --> 01:56:27.100]  Six years ago, I wasn't streaming the show on the web, so we couldn't really do this.
[01:56:27.100 --> 01:56:28.501]  Let's go to Janice in Texas.
[01:56:28.501 --> 01:56:29.181]  You're on the air.
[01:56:29.181 --> 01:56:31.242]  Go ahead.
[01:56:31.242 --> 01:56:32.623]  Hi, Alex.
[01:56:32.623 --> 01:56:37.604]  I have to tell you about this rodeo that you can't miss.
[01:56:37.604 --> 01:56:38.705]  Let's see.
[01:56:38.705 --> 01:56:51.190]  If you go to bio.org, they're having a huge thing in Austin, Texas from April 16th through, I don't know, April 18th.
[01:56:51.190 --> 01:56:51.970]  They don't say the dates.
[01:56:52.805 --> 01:56:56.266]  But it's the whole biotech industry.
[01:56:56.266 --> 01:56:57.187]  It's everybody.
[01:56:57.187 --> 01:57:00.628]  I mean, the attendees read like the New York Stock Exchange.
[01:57:00.628 --> 01:57:17.095]  Human Genome, Bain Capital, Baxter Biosciences, Baxter Healthcare, Bureau of International Affairs, Biotech Industry, Org, Cephalon, Eli Lilly, Genzyme, Glaxo, SmithKline, Hydro Biosciences, Pfizer, Sirius Genomics.
[01:57:17.095 --> 01:57:19.736]  I mean, this is everybody.
[01:57:19.736 --> 01:57:21.357]  And on the main page it has
[01:57:22.634 --> 01:57:29.180]  The bioethicist, you know, the killing babies at three and all that stuff.
[01:57:29.180 --> 01:57:30.622]  Oh, really, they're having those folks there.
[01:57:30.622 --> 01:57:36.207]  Hey, we got all the bioweapons and kill the babies!
[01:57:36.207 --> 01:57:46.617]  Well, their main deal that they're going to do is the biotech patent landscape, where they, you know, like the women at Brack Analysis, where they steal your genes.
[01:57:47.694 --> 01:58:01.080]  Yeah, they steal your blood at birth, put it in a global database now for 40 plus years, globally, and then when you go in to get a genetic treatment they go, oh sorry, we got your blood at birth and we patented it and we own it, your particular protein.
[01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:02.320]  Hmm.
[01:58:02.320 --> 01:58:02.921]  Yeah.
[01:58:02.921 --> 01:58:06.182]  Well, they're getting it everywhere, not just there.
[01:58:06.182 --> 01:58:12.985]  But they're nice people though, because they want the children to take the shots because they care about them, but then separately talk about how they want to kill them.
[01:58:14.841 --> 01:58:16.961]  Yeah, well, I don't know.
[01:58:16.961 --> 01:58:18.942]  I think somebody should go to this.
[01:58:18.942 --> 01:58:19.582]  I hear you.
[01:58:19.582 --> 01:58:21.082]  I'll try to send the reporter.
[01:58:21.082 --> 01:58:25.743]  So they're having a giant biotech conference here in Austin coming up in a few weeks.
[01:58:25.743 --> 01:58:28.163]  Yeah, you can get it on bio.org.
[01:58:28.163 --> 01:58:30.544]  And then just go to conferences.
[01:58:30.544 --> 01:58:33.784]  Well, hey, I mean, Bayer put out the pesticide that's killing all the bees.
[01:58:33.784 --> 01:58:35.405]  I mean, that's good.
[01:58:35.405 --> 01:58:36.585]  These are good people.
[01:58:36.585 --> 01:58:41.566]  Maybe I'll go there and worship them.

[02:00:12.154 --> 02:00:13.694]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.694 --> 02:00:17.876]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.876 --> 02:00:21.958]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.967 --> 02:00:29.909]  Alright, it's open phones in the shower.
[02:00:29.909 --> 02:00:32.952]  Coming up, I will get to the Black Panther audio.
[02:00:32.952 --> 02:00:34.373]  We had to cut out all the cuss words.
[02:00:34.373 --> 02:00:39.979]  We've got a blurb at InfoWars.com that's got it with the cuss words and then without, so it's family friendly.
[02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:45.002]  Amazing calling for race war, that's coming up.
[02:00:45.002 --> 02:00:49.044]  A bunch of other news that we haven't gotten to, but right now let's go back to your calls.
[02:00:49.044 --> 02:00:51.666]  Kevin in Pennsylvania, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:00:51.666 --> 02:00:53.107]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[02:00:53.107 --> 02:00:54.328]  I'm doing alright.
[02:00:54.328 --> 02:00:56.329]  I've been listening to you for 10 years, can you hear me okay?
[02:00:56.329 --> 02:00:58.030]  Yes sir, I can.
[02:00:58.030 --> 02:01:10.658]  I found a clip on YouTube of you cursing out a guy using the F word on air, simply because you mentioned Benjamin Friedman and Jack Bernstein, who I don't know yet who they are, but can you explain that to me please sir?
[02:01:11.522 --> 02:01:13.163]  I remember that was about five years ago.
[02:01:13.163 --> 02:01:24.131]  It's that guy from ProThink and I was in overdrive and I just had a big piece of equipment break and then some news about one of my family members.
[02:01:26.482 --> 02:01:28.744]  Getting cancer, that's all I'm going to say.
[02:01:28.744 --> 02:01:32.527]  And I was going to cancel during that hour, but it was the first day of overdrive.
[02:01:32.527 --> 02:01:38.312]  So the person called up, and I just purely vented on them for no reason.
[02:01:38.312 --> 02:01:40.373]  And I didn't even know who those people were.
[02:01:40.373 --> 02:01:42.856]  Later, I went and looked up what they had to say.
[02:01:42.856 --> 02:01:45.798]  So it was just completely, you know, wrong time.
[02:01:45.798 --> 02:01:49.621]  And I lost control of myself.
[02:01:49.621 --> 02:01:51.683]  And people are like, wow, who is this guy?
[02:01:51.923 --> 02:01:55.805]  But if the guy wanted to get attention for what he wanted, I gave him a great gift.
[02:01:55.805 --> 02:01:59.427]  But it was just purely, absolutely, you know, half-cocked.
[02:01:59.427 --> 02:02:06.150]  I mean, I knew who the guy was who was calling, and so I was a little bit irritated with him, just because he'd said some things about me that I thought weren't fair.
[02:02:06.150 --> 02:02:08.031]  But then I just blew up.
[02:02:08.031 --> 02:02:11.413]  So there, there's the big secret of that.
[02:02:11.413 --> 02:02:13.474]  Does that answer your question?
[02:02:13.474 --> 02:02:19.337]  The only part of the way, because, see, I've been, I tripped, I'm a truth seeker, and I found out that
[02:02:20.183 --> 02:02:24.429]  Albert Pike said that when the people need a hero, we will supply him.
[02:02:24.429 --> 02:02:26.873]  And I also found a clip that said, that's who you are.
[02:02:26.873 --> 02:02:28.355]  You are a plant by the New World Order.
[02:02:28.945 --> 02:02:33.749]  You are actually working for them, which I actually wondered when I started listening to you.
[02:02:33.749 --> 02:02:34.890]  Why isn't this guy dead?
[02:02:34.890 --> 02:02:37.311]  Why are you supposed to know all their secrets, but you ain't?
[02:02:37.311 --> 02:02:39.373]  But that's because you're working for the New World Order.
[02:02:39.373 --> 02:02:40.434]  Is that possible?
[02:02:40.434 --> 02:02:48.240]  There is a video clip that's like an hour long, and I think it's the best interview I've ever done with David Icke, called, This Isn't a Bloody Game.
[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:50.822]  And the last 10 minutes we address this.
[02:02:50.822 --> 02:02:53.644]  You know, people always say, address why you're not dead.
[02:02:53.644 --> 02:02:54.905]  I've probably addressed that.
[02:02:56.568 --> 02:03:12.769]  500 no no that's something a thousand times on air in in in the last decade because I mean I dress it like every week a couple times a week so how many times is that over the years I mean it's a lot I have addressed why I'm still alive have you not ever heard me address why I'm still alive can you hear me
[02:03:13.573 --> 02:03:15.074]  Sir, come on, I can hear you.
[02:03:15.074 --> 02:03:15.654]  Can you hear me?
[02:03:15.654 --> 02:03:17.475]  No, no, I don't know when I got caught off or not.
[02:03:17.475 --> 02:03:18.555]  Hold on a minute!
[02:03:18.555 --> 02:03:19.636]  Come on, let's be normal.
[02:03:19.636 --> 02:03:25.658]  Because you guys that like to disagree and say I'm all these things, I actually really care about you and I want to really talk to you.
[02:03:25.658 --> 02:03:26.498]  Okay?
[02:03:26.498 --> 02:03:30.400]  So listen, have you not heard me answer that question literally probably a thousand times?
[02:03:30.868 --> 02:03:33.409]  Well, Alex, I found... Hold on!
[02:03:33.409 --> 02:03:33.850]  Hold on!
[02:03:33.850 --> 02:03:38.132]  If you want to attack me, I'll let you talk on air and attack me.
[02:03:38.132 --> 02:03:39.052]  Okay?
[02:03:39.052 --> 02:03:40.833]  I'll hold you over and you can attack me.
[02:03:40.833 --> 02:03:42.494]  But have a dialogue, man.
[02:03:42.494 --> 02:03:43.794]  Come on!
[02:03:43.794 --> 02:03:47.576]  Really, have you not heard me answer that question before?
[02:03:47.576 --> 02:03:50.118]  Do I need to answer it for you again?
[02:03:50.118 --> 02:03:52.299]  Because people say, you won't answer this question.
[02:03:52.299 --> 02:03:56.541]  Most of these questions I've answered 50 to 100 or more times.
[02:03:56.541 --> 02:03:58.662]  Have you not heard me explain why I'm still alive?
[02:03:59.525 --> 02:04:03.666]  Alex, your role is to deflect criticism away from the Zionists, which I didn't see.
[02:04:03.666 --> 02:04:04.266]  There you go.
[02:04:04.266 --> 02:04:05.007]  Hold on.
[02:04:05.007 --> 02:04:05.347]  Hold on.
[02:04:05.347 --> 02:04:08.307]  If you disrespect me like this, I'm not going to talk to you anymore.
[02:04:08.307 --> 02:04:11.648]  You want to call up with accusations, I answered one of your questions.
[02:04:11.648 --> 02:04:13.589]  You moved on to the next thing.
[02:04:13.589 --> 02:04:13.989]  Okay?
[02:04:13.989 --> 02:04:19.090]  I am critical of what Israel does in many respects.
[02:04:19.090 --> 02:04:21.031]  I don't hate Israel or the Jewish people.
[02:04:21.031 --> 02:04:22.191]  That's the difference.
[02:04:22.191 --> 02:04:23.632]  And I'm not obsessed with it.
[02:04:23.632 --> 02:04:25.512]  Quite frankly, I get sick of hearing about it all the time.
[02:04:25.512 --> 02:04:28.013]  I've been attacked by the ADL, all of it, but I don't care.
[02:04:28.573 --> 02:04:30.134]  Okay, I know I'm a good person.
[02:04:30.134 --> 02:04:31.455]  My fruits are good.
[02:04:31.455 --> 02:04:33.856]  I've woken up more people than anybody else.
[02:04:33.856 --> 02:04:35.197]  And I appreciate your call.
[02:04:35.197 --> 02:04:38.959]  But I'll answer your question again, because you wouldn't say I haven't answered it.
[02:04:38.959 --> 02:04:39.220]  Okay?
[02:04:39.220 --> 02:04:40.800]  You must not have heard me.
[02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:42.502]  It would highlight everything I've said.
[02:04:42.502 --> 02:04:44.122]  I said this in the first hour, by the way.
[02:04:44.122 --> 02:04:45.583]  If I was killed.
[02:04:45.583 --> 02:04:47.324]  It would underline everything I've done.
[02:04:47.324 --> 02:04:48.225]  And there's providence.
[02:04:48.225 --> 02:04:49.386]  I have a lot of people praying for me.
[02:04:50.086 --> 02:04:51.026]  Okay?
[02:04:51.026 --> 02:04:54.847]  And they've tried to put me in prison and stuff, but by the grace of God, I'm still here.
[02:04:54.847 --> 02:05:01.448]  I'm still here because we're effective, and if they kill me, it'll make me a martyr.
[02:05:01.448 --> 02:05:02.528]  I had tried everything.
[02:05:02.528 --> 02:05:04.869]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[02:05:04.869 --> 02:05:08.009]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[02:05:08.009 --> 02:05:12.830]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements, as well as key vitamins.
[02:05:12.830 --> 02:05:19.211]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[02:05:19.691 --> 02:05:30.920]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:05:30.920 --> 02:05:35.383]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[02:05:35.383 --> 02:05:41.648]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:05:41.648 --> 02:05:42.789]  Now that's results.
[02:05:43.209 --> 02:05:55.716]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfoWarsTeam.com and to order just three of their products and you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.
[02:05:55.716 --> 02:05:58.278]  Start your journey to health and wellness today.
[02:05:58.278 --> 02:05:59.559]  InfoWarsTeam.com
[02:06:01.343 --> 02:06:07.986]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:06:07.986 --> 02:06:13.128]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:06:13.128 --> 02:06:21.852]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:06:21.852 --> 02:06:25.934]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:06:25.934 --> 02:06:28.295]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:06:30.199 --> 02:06:34.942]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:06:34.942 --> 02:06:40.025]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it, others don't.
[02:06:40.025 --> 02:06:42.166]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:06:42.166 --> 02:06:43.947]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:06:43.947 --> 02:06:46.829]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:06:46.829 --> 02:06:53.453]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.

[02:06:56.155 --> 02:06:59.377]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it, others don't.
[02:07:01.707 --> 02:07:03.409]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:07:03.409 --> 02:07:08.716]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:07:08.716 --> 02:07:10.259]  Saving means to make money.
[02:07:10.259 --> 02:07:19.050]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:07:19.771 --> 02:07:27.294]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:07:27.294 --> 02:07:35.297]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:07:35.297 --> 02:07:40.539]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[02:07:40.539 --> 02:07:42.700]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[02:08:01.034 --> 02:08:06.439]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.439 --> 02:08:08.721]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:16.875 --> 02:08:36.381]  Okay, we're going to continue with calls in this segment, and then I've got to get to this audio of the New Black Panther Party calling for blood in the streets today.
[02:08:36.381 --> 02:08:43.804]  And they've been calling for this over and over again, which is yelling fire in the theater or going out and calling for insurrection.
[02:08:43.804 --> 02:08:45.104]  It is calling for bloodshed.
[02:08:46.636 --> 02:08:50.699]  It's one thing to say, if the government keeps pushing, they're going to get a revolution.
[02:08:50.699 --> 02:08:55.201]  Then they go and arrest the Atari militia people and throw them under the jail.
[02:08:55.201 --> 02:09:06.549]  But when you've got actual groups running around calling for violent uprisings and like Mecha and La Raza calling for the takeover of the Southwest and pulling down American flags and all this, the government's like, oh, isn't that sweet?
[02:09:07.509 --> 02:09:11.151]  Because the government is run by traitors that want to bring this country down.
[02:09:11.151 --> 02:09:13.252]  So that is coming up.
[02:09:13.252 --> 02:09:16.033]  Also, Aaron just found more MIT information.
[02:09:16.033 --> 02:09:20.655]  They've got a new report out saying world population will be reduced by over 90%.
[02:09:20.655 --> 02:09:23.237]  This is MIT.
[02:09:23.237 --> 02:09:24.337]  First, they give reasons.
[02:09:24.337 --> 02:09:28.119]  Your resources are about to be cut off and there'll be new diseases.
[02:09:28.119 --> 02:09:29.940]  Oh, who's cutting our resources off?
[02:09:29.940 --> 02:09:33.041]  And in other documents, saying they're the ones cutting it off.
[02:09:33.041 --> 02:09:35.823]  But in this, it's like, get ready for doom and disaster.
[02:09:37.375 --> 02:09:46.400]  In the next, you know, 15 years or so, then the media will be like, isn't it incredible that MIT in 2012 predicted all this?
[02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:50.442]  Gee, it's good to have them in charge!
[02:09:50.442 --> 02:09:52.744]  So that's coming up as well.
[02:09:52.744 --> 02:09:56.706]  But right now, let's go to John in Texas.
[02:09:56.706 --> 02:09:58.907]  John, welcome.
[02:09:58.907 --> 02:09:59.728]  Hi, Alex.
[02:09:59.728 --> 02:10:00.028]  Hey, buddy.
[02:10:01.718 --> 02:10:05.701]  You know, back in the mid-1960s, I was in high school.
[02:10:05.701 --> 02:10:09.743]  I lived an hour north of Detroit when the Detroit riots broke out.
[02:10:09.743 --> 02:10:13.966]  And it got so bad that they had to send a regular army in to help put it down.
[02:10:13.966 --> 02:10:21.411]  And when I got to Vietnam in 1970, I had a friend of mine over there who was a career soldier.
[02:10:21.411 --> 02:10:24.833]  He was one of the soldiers they sent into Detroit, and he used to tell me, you think this is bad?
[02:10:24.833 --> 02:10:27.375]  You should have been in Detroit.
[02:10:27.375 --> 02:10:29.817]  And I talked to another guy that lived down in the suburbs,
[02:10:30.535 --> 02:10:37.399]  Right on the outside of Detroit, he said him and his neighbors went out in the front yard and dug foxholes and got their weapons out and dug in, you know.
[02:10:37.399 --> 02:10:38.620]  Well, I mean, that's the thing.
[02:10:38.620 --> 02:10:45.884]  What's so ridiculous about the Black Panther, the new Black Panther Party leaders saying they're going to have a race war with Whitey?
[02:10:45.884 --> 02:10:54.489]  All that's going to happen is, is that the idiots that go out and do this are going to burn down their own neighborhoods and infrastructure and businesses so there's no jobs for anybody.
[02:10:55.129 --> 02:10:59.550]  And then they're going to shoot at the firemen and police department people like they've done in L.A.
[02:10:59.550 --> 02:10:59.950]  and stuff.
[02:10:59.950 --> 02:11:02.511]  And then the cops are going to shoot back and kill a bunch of people.
[02:11:02.511 --> 02:11:05.852]  And then the cops are going to pull back to be politically correct.
[02:11:05.852 --> 02:11:07.452]  And I mean, that's ridiculous.
[02:11:07.452 --> 02:11:14.294]  If a foreign army, say, came out into the countryside where I live at, I'm pro-gun, but it's almost annoying.
[02:11:15.114 --> 02:11:24.182]  That Saturday and Sunday and usually any evening, it's weapons fire continually and sounds like Armageddon.
[02:11:24.182 --> 02:11:31.188]  I mean, I've got neighbors on both sides of me where five hours you're outside with the kids trying to dig in the sandbox.
[02:11:32.441 --> 02:11:33.222]  for five hours.
[02:11:33.222 --> 02:11:52.814]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
[02:11:54.301 --> 02:12:01.023]  They know about the collapse of society and of any, you know, hordes of city slickers come out there and think they're going to rob anybody.
[02:12:01.023 --> 02:12:03.364]  It's going to be a complete bloodbath.
[02:12:03.364 --> 02:12:13.467]  So it's just total mindlessness disconnected from reality to say that anyone is going to come into the countryside and kill Whitey.
[02:12:13.467 --> 02:12:19.988]  Whitey is so dug in with weaponry and so ready to start killing and make your head spin.
[02:12:23.806 --> 02:12:26.747]  It's very, very sad because everybody's being attacked by the globalists.
[02:12:26.747 --> 02:12:32.488]  The globalists are shutting our economy off and they want us to fight with each other instead of getting our country back.
[02:12:32.488 --> 02:12:39.730]  And that's why the government has MSNBC editing tapes to make it sound like George Zimmerman was being racist.
[02:12:39.730 --> 02:12:45.991]  And that's why they let the new Black Panther Party call for violence because it's all an attempt to start a race war.
[02:12:47.605 --> 02:13:01.913]  This is absolutely what's going on 110% and Curt Nemo has an article on it with the unedited video and audio where they're calling for killing Whitey and you know the red sea of blood and start killing Whitey.
[02:13:01.913 --> 02:13:08.537]  And the new Black Panther leader is saying get guns, get gas masks, get food.
[02:13:08.537 --> 02:13:09.578]  Why?
[02:13:09.578 --> 02:13:13.800]  So we can all be in bunkers killing each other while the bankers laugh at everybody?
[02:13:13.800 --> 02:13:14.901]  This is so stupid!
[02:13:15.711 --> 02:13:17.352]  This is so stupid.
[02:13:17.352 --> 02:13:18.452]  I've said it over and over again.
[02:13:18.452 --> 02:13:22.715]  They want to get a war between the American people and the police and the military going.
[02:13:22.715 --> 02:13:25.416]  How many times have I said, let's not show up.
[02:13:25.416 --> 02:13:27.037]  Let's not have it.
[02:13:27.037 --> 02:13:31.900]  That's how desperate the globalists are going into this worldwide depression and wars.
[02:13:31.900 --> 02:13:35.442]  And now it's, well, let's just get the blacks and whites killing each other.
[02:13:35.442 --> 02:13:37.903]  And they want to get the whites and Hispanics killing each other.
[02:13:37.903 --> 02:13:43.506]  I mean, it is so... And then the government's going to play the part of coming in and restoring order.
[02:13:45.897 --> 02:13:47.558]  I mean, this is cut and dry!
[02:13:47.558 --> 02:13:53.963]  MSNBC is engaged in sedition, trying to hype blacks to riot in this country.
[02:13:53.963 --> 02:13:56.645]  Because they don't want blacks and whites being friendly with each other.
[02:13:56.645 --> 02:13:59.528]  And all that'll make is whites that aren't racist?
[02:13:59.528 --> 02:14:02.630]  Most white people I know are not racist of black people.
[02:14:02.630 --> 02:14:06.893]  In fact, they're into black films, football stars, music.
[02:14:06.893 --> 02:14:09.255]  They're scared of black people.
[02:14:09.255 --> 02:14:10.836]  Let me explain the difference.
[02:14:10.836 --> 02:14:12.338]  Whites I know, on average,
[02:14:13.470 --> 02:14:16.694]  Are not racist in any way.
[02:14:16.694 --> 02:14:22.080]  But they are scared and black people I know aren't comfortable in a lot of cases around white people.
[02:14:23.052 --> 02:14:24.872]  You see how that works?
[02:14:24.872 --> 02:14:30.414]  And so now, they want to make a poster child for all this, the new Black Panther Party.
[02:14:30.414 --> 02:14:36.895]  Because the Black Panthers actually did some good early on, trying to tell blacks, get armed, defend yourselves, don't be slaves, stand up for yourself.
[02:14:36.895 --> 02:14:38.315]  I'm all about being empowered.
[02:14:38.315 --> 02:14:43.596]  The new Black Panther Party is a government psyop, and I'll bet you a million dollars.
[02:14:43.596 --> 02:14:46.917]  And I said this about Hal Turner for 10 years, the white supremacist leader.
[02:14:46.917 --> 02:14:48.677]  I said, that guy's a fed.
[02:14:48.677 --> 02:14:50.538]  He wouldn't be allowed to say that if he wasn't one.
[02:14:50.538 --> 02:14:50.958]  And you know what?
[02:14:50.958 --> 02:14:51.938]  It turned out he was a fed.
[02:14:52.935 --> 02:14:55.217]  He admitted it himself, setting people up.
[02:14:55.217 --> 02:15:01.200]  These Black Panther leaders are feds, or they are the dumbest, useful idiots I've ever seen, and they don't sound dumb.
[02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:02.301]  They're feds.
[02:15:02.301 --> 02:15:08.565]  They're feds, just like MSNBC is run out of the White House on record and edit tapes.
[02:15:08.565 --> 02:15:10.446]  Makes me so sick.
[02:15:10.446 --> 02:15:20.133]  And then Obama can sit back and act like he's not part of all this racial stuff, and let's come together, come on now, while his surrogates are out there stirring this up.
[02:15:20.133 --> 02:15:21.654]  And I, for one, have had enough of it, so
[02:15:25.987 --> 02:15:33.452]  I mean, let's just say 10,000 black people wanted to invade the small town I live in and come kill the whites.
[02:15:33.452 --> 02:15:39.376]  It is so crazy and so ridiculous, okay?
[02:15:39.376 --> 02:15:44.720]  White people are in the countryside dug in, and they're almost all former military.
[02:15:44.720 --> 02:15:46.261]  I'm just gonna leave it at that, okay?
[02:15:46.261 --> 02:15:49.123]  Dug in.
[02:15:49.123 --> 02:15:50.124]  Dug in.
[02:15:50.124 --> 02:15:51.485]  I mean, we had friends here in town.
[02:15:52.492 --> 02:15:54.153]  I'm not going to get into it.
[02:15:54.153 --> 02:15:58.874]  The point is, you go around looking at houses and stuff, like a third of them are bunkers.
[02:15:58.874 --> 02:16:03.076]  Look normal on the outside, bunkers on the inside.
[02:16:03.076 --> 02:16:13.939]  I mean, almost everybody I know has .50 calibers and 7 Mag Lapuas and know how to shoot a fly off a fence post at 200 yards.
[02:16:13.939 --> 02:16:21.162]  And I've told the police and military, don't blow up a bunch of stuff or have your bosses do it and then try to march against the American people.
[02:16:22.199 --> 02:16:24.942]  And of course, the military's awake and they know this and they understand.
[02:16:24.942 --> 02:16:27.685]  The police are waking up.
[02:16:27.685 --> 02:16:29.888]  I had an alarm go off this weekend.
[02:16:29.888 --> 02:16:31.169]  It's malfunctioning or something.
[02:16:31.169 --> 02:16:32.391]  I think I lived in another house.
[02:16:32.391 --> 02:16:33.993]  This happened where squirrels had eaten the cords.
[02:16:33.993 --> 02:16:35.474]  I don't know what's doing it.
[02:16:35.474 --> 02:16:37.737]  But it says a door alarm goes off.
[02:16:37.737 --> 02:16:40.260]  Once I was out of town, it happened and nobody broke in.
[02:16:40.260 --> 02:16:41.702]  The other night, it's in the middle of the night.
[02:16:43.050 --> 02:16:46.051]  And the alarm goes off, and the alarm company calls and says, what's the code word?
[02:16:46.051 --> 02:16:48.751]  And I said it to them, and they said, spell it.
[02:16:48.751 --> 02:16:50.052]  And I said, I don't know how to spell it.
[02:16:50.052 --> 02:16:50.512]  I've never done this.
[02:16:50.512 --> 02:16:52.352]  I was nice, but I said, come on.
[02:16:52.352 --> 02:16:53.352]  I'm Alex Jones, blah, blah.
[02:16:53.352 --> 02:16:54.593]  And they said, OK, thank you.
[02:16:54.593 --> 02:17:02.635]  20 minutes later, there are lights and police out there walking around.
[02:17:02.635 --> 02:17:04.375]  So I go outside, go up to the gate.
[02:17:06.261 --> 02:17:11.126]  And they were real nice, and I said who I was, and one of them looked at me and said, OK, let's get out of here.
[02:17:11.126 --> 02:17:14.950]  But the female cop goes, let me see your driver's license.
[02:17:14.950 --> 02:17:18.754]  And the guy obviously knew who I was, but he just wasn't going to second guess her.
[02:17:18.754 --> 02:17:22.358]  And I had my jeans on, my shirt off, and my wallet, and I showed her.
[02:17:22.358 --> 02:17:25.441]  And she goes, Alexander Emmerich Jones, mm-mm.
[02:17:25.441 --> 02:17:27.043]  And I looked at her, and I was like, you know who I am.
[02:17:27.734 --> 02:17:30.195]  Sure, you know who I am and you just asked for that.
[02:17:30.195 --> 02:17:31.695]  But they were overall friendly.
[02:17:31.695 --> 02:17:34.475]  And I got an alarm so I'm asking for police at my house.
[02:17:34.475 --> 02:17:36.096]  Side issue.
[02:17:36.096 --> 02:17:37.016]  John, are you still there?
[02:17:37.016 --> 02:17:37.816]  I'm ranting.
[02:17:37.816 --> 02:17:39.176]  I mean, how does that add to your story?
[02:17:39.176 --> 02:17:50.119]  Another thing I was going to say, Alex, is they got a new stock out called the Slide Fire that you put on an AR-15 or an AK-47 and it increases the fire rate to 750 rounds a minute.
[02:17:51.622 --> 02:17:53.484]  And right now they've been selling like hotcakes.
[02:17:53.484 --> 02:18:00.529]  They've been on sale for about less than a year and they've sold like 200,000 and they're still... What is it again?
[02:18:00.529 --> 02:18:03.231]  It's a new stock called the Slide Fire.
[02:18:03.231 --> 02:18:10.496]  You go to Google and type in Slide Fire and it increases... you put it on AR-15 or AK-47 and it increases the rate of fire to 750 rounds a minute.
[02:18:12.122 --> 02:18:13.462]  On a semi-auto?
[02:18:13.462 --> 02:18:14.503]  On a semi-auto.
[02:18:14.503 --> 02:18:17.044]  Just go to Google and type in... But let me ask you a question.
[02:18:17.044 --> 02:18:27.167]  When would you need to have... I mean, I... Because, I mean, with a 30-round clip at semi-auto, I can hit targets shooting about every half a second.
[02:18:27.167 --> 02:18:38.471]  But, I mean, if it was full-auto, you just spray 30 rounds, that'd be... I mean, isn't that only if people are pouring in through your door or down into your foxhole, then you've got to go full-auto and do a spray?
[02:18:38.471 --> 02:18:40.772]  I mean, don't you want semi-auto to begin with?
[02:18:41.843 --> 02:18:56.655]  I fought in Vietnam and when I got over there they told us, they took us out to the range and they let us fire full-auto and then they let us fire semi, just to prove that semi is more effective to be used in a combat situation than full-auto, even though full-auto was always meant as an emergency switch.
[02:18:56.655 --> 02:18:58.376]  It was never, you went to full-auto.
[02:18:58.376 --> 02:18:59.097]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:18:59.097 --> 02:19:01.519]  That's like when you're getting human wave attacks in Korea.
[02:19:01.519 --> 02:19:06.303]  But what I like is a 100-round drum on a MAC-90 AK-47 semi-auto variant.
[02:19:08.064 --> 02:19:12.945]  I think overall, in 100-yard type situations, that's one of the best guns out there.
[02:19:12.945 --> 02:19:19.307]  I mean, obviously there's more high-powered stuff, HK91, you know, things like that that are really great rifles.
[02:19:19.307 --> 02:19:28.630]  The .308 packs a lot more punch, but it's just, man, I tell you, those AK-47s just have never, I've probably owned 10 of them, you know, the semi-auto versions, they've never given me a problem.
[02:19:28.630 --> 02:19:31.671]  They're just magical firearms.
[02:19:31.671 --> 02:19:36.412]  Go to Google, though, and type in slide fire, it'll have demonstrations of the gun.
[02:19:37.738 --> 02:19:40.080]  Yeah, but I mean, do you like the AK-47?
[02:19:40.080 --> 02:19:45.824]  Yeah, I got four of them, and I got a couple AR-15s too, and I got a slide fire stock too.
[02:19:45.824 --> 02:19:47.145]  I just use that in an emergency.
[02:19:47.145 --> 02:19:48.386]  That's just an emergency use only.
[02:19:48.386 --> 02:19:50.808]  Yeah, well I've just got AK-47s all over the place.
[02:19:50.808 --> 02:19:53.110]  I mean, you can't have enough of them.
[02:19:53.110 --> 02:19:55.191]  Alright, but I'm scared of the Black Panthers.
[02:19:55.191 --> 02:19:55.632]  Don't get me.
[02:19:57.076 --> 02:19:57.856]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:57.856 --> 02:19:58.876]  Stay with us.
[02:19:58.876 --> 02:20:01.257]  Warrior Call straight ahead.
[02:20:01.257 --> 02:20:08.398]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[02:20:08.398 --> 02:20:25.841]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:20:26.121 --> 02:20:32.246]  I've been searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[02:20:32.246 --> 02:20:40.332]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[02:20:40.332 --> 02:20:41.753]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months.
[02:20:43.835 --> 02:20:46.577]  Simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.

[02:21:00.865 --> 02:21:03.067]  What is the most abundant resource on Earth?
[02:21:03.067 --> 02:21:03.587]  Water.
[02:21:03.587 --> 02:21:05.309]  It's essential for sustaining life.
[02:21:05.309 --> 02:21:06.990]  But it's not always the most available.
[02:21:06.990 --> 02:21:10.313]  When disaster strikes, water quickly vanishes from store shelves.
[02:21:10.313 --> 02:21:13.716]  Like it did during 9-11, Katrina, Japan, and in Joplin.
[02:21:13.716 --> 02:21:16.418]  Three days without water and your body begins to shut down.
[02:21:16.418 --> 02:21:20.302]  Don't risk being without an abundant supply of water when the next disaster hits.

[02:24:04.984 --> 02:24:07.648]  Ira Hazen Ira Hazen
[02:24:27.491 --> 02:24:40.277]  Look, Americans have been ignorant to a certain extent and let our freedoms be taken because we had so many great things going on and so much prosperity.
[02:24:40.277 --> 02:24:42.839]  We got drunk on prosperity and success.
[02:24:43.559 --> 02:24:57.867]  Whether you're black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young, everybody deep down knows things are not going in the right direction and that the government is run by criminals and that we're in a depression and it's getting worse and that the media is lying to us.
[02:24:57.867 --> 02:25:05.851]  And that's why there's been a full-on armament campaign the last five years going on that has now doubled its previous records.
[02:25:05.851 --> 02:25:08.833]  In fact, I was wrong when I said five million guns are being sold a month.
[02:25:08.833 --> 02:25:11.514]  It's more like seven million.
[02:25:11.514 --> 02:25:12.755]  Everyone is arming to the teeth.
[02:25:14.890 --> 02:25:20.875]  And that's a good thing to a point, but a bad thing because it's good people are armed.
[02:25:20.875 --> 02:25:21.795]  That's great.
[02:25:21.795 --> 02:25:29.981]  But the bad silver lining is the cruddy lining is that the system is going to use that to demonize the Second Amendment.
[02:25:29.981 --> 02:25:33.184]  There's going to be some idiots who are going to do some stupid things with guns.
[02:25:33.184 --> 02:25:37.547]  And that's why I got my guns to defend myself from those stupid idiots.
[02:25:37.547 --> 02:25:39.468]  So I'm 100% for the Second Amendment.
[02:25:39.468 --> 02:25:41.250]  I'm just talking about how they're going to use it to spin it.
[02:25:42.794 --> 02:25:45.516]  And here are some of the reports, town hall reports.
[02:25:45.516 --> 02:25:46.117]  Great news!
[02:25:46.117 --> 02:25:47.598]  They're being sarcastic.
[02:25:47.598 --> 02:25:53.503]  New Black Panther is called to create Red Sea of Bloodshed in a race war.
[02:25:53.503 --> 02:25:54.584]  We've got that audio.
[02:25:54.584 --> 02:25:57.046]  We're going to start playing it now and come back from break with it.
[02:25:57.046 --> 02:26:01.150]  The New Black Panther Party wants a race war and they want it to start tomorrow.
[02:26:01.150 --> 02:26:02.231]  That's today.
[02:26:02.231 --> 02:26:10.238]  In an audio recording of a planned meeting for a Trayvon Martin rally, New Black Panther Party members have resorted to violent action.
[02:26:11.664 --> 02:26:15.326]  It's what they're calling revolution.
[02:26:15.326 --> 02:26:16.567]  Yeah, that's a great idea.
[02:26:16.567 --> 02:26:19.408]  I mean, the police have got all those armored vehicles and weapons.
[02:26:19.408 --> 02:26:20.909]  They're just waiting.
[02:26:20.909 --> 02:26:25.131]  But you notice, I bet the police are going to pull back if they do something.
[02:26:25.131 --> 02:26:27.012]  And let the burning begin.
[02:26:27.012 --> 02:26:31.615]  Because, again, it's got to get out of control.
[02:26:31.615 --> 02:26:35.717]  We've got to suit up and boot up and get prepared for the war we're in.
[02:26:35.717 --> 02:26:37.038]  I'm about to play this.
[02:26:37.038 --> 02:26:40.119]  True revolution means some bloodshed.
[02:26:40.119 --> 02:26:41.000]  Some bloodshed, huh?
[02:26:42.637 --> 02:26:45.519]  What did that Mohammed guy say?
[02:26:45.519 --> 02:26:48.480]  He's dead now of a brain aneurysm.
[02:26:48.480 --> 02:26:59.687]  He'd say, you kill the white women, you kill the white babies, and you kill the babies, the little white devils, and you kill the white woman because she's the military manufacturing center.
[02:26:59.687 --> 02:27:01.888]  All this baloney.
[02:27:01.888 --> 02:27:03.229]  I love doing imitation though.
[02:27:04.704 --> 02:27:10.189]  We're going to have to cause the Red Sea.
[02:27:10.189 --> 02:27:15.555]  I'm talking about blonde-haired, blue-eyed, sometimes brown-eyed Caucasians walking around.
[02:27:15.555 --> 02:27:17.477]  I am for violence.
[02:27:17.477 --> 02:27:21.220]  And this is the kind of talk that will probably get some black people killed.
[02:27:21.220 --> 02:27:25.425]  Because there's already been a bunch of cases of whites being attacked.
[02:27:26.300 --> 02:27:29.702]  And then this one guy, his dad reportedly got killed by a black guy.
[02:27:29.702 --> 02:27:34.364]  So now they went into, reportedly, in Oklahoma and shot a bunch of innocent black people.
[02:27:34.364 --> 02:27:36.686]  Oh, this is just wonderful.
[02:27:36.686 --> 02:27:40.688]  This is just gonna be absolute, no, it's horrible.
[02:27:40.688 --> 02:27:43.469]  It's horrible.
[02:27:43.469 --> 02:27:45.591]  He goes, I am for violence.
[02:27:45.591 --> 02:27:49.993]  So he's saying, kill blonde haired, blue eyed people, I am for violence for you to see a red.
[02:27:49.993 --> 02:27:51.454]  Boom, arrest him right there.
[02:27:52.625 --> 02:27:53.846]  That is not free speech.
[02:27:53.846 --> 02:27:56.468]  That is a call to action, a call to violence.
[02:27:56.468 --> 02:28:06.996]  If I got on air and said, get guns, or if you got on air and said, get guns, go out and find some black people and kill them, we need blood, I should be arrested, if I said go out and do that.
[02:28:06.996 --> 02:28:16.344]  If your neighbor said, go out and kill white people, go out and kill Hispanics, go out, any group, go out and kill Muslims,
[02:28:17.990 --> 02:28:19.111]  Any group.
[02:28:19.111 --> 02:28:22.293]  I mean, that is a call to kill people.
[02:28:22.293 --> 02:28:23.774]  And you know what?
[02:28:23.774 --> 02:28:26.116]  It's already happening.
[02:28:26.116 --> 02:28:27.117]  It's already happening.
[02:28:27.117 --> 02:28:28.558]  So, there you go.
[02:28:28.558 --> 02:28:33.942]  Obama's starting a race war.
[02:28:33.942 --> 02:28:41.128]  He goes on to say, I am bleeped off right now because the state of Florida isn't on fire.
[02:28:41.128 --> 02:28:41.828]  I'm reading the quotes.
[02:28:41.828 --> 02:28:43.129]  We're gonna come back and play it.
[02:28:43.129 --> 02:28:45.411]  We've got to starve capitalism.
[02:28:47.278 --> 02:28:49.020]  Really, what about banksterism?
[02:28:49.020 --> 02:28:50.842]  We want the complete removal of capitalism.
[02:28:50.842 --> 02:28:51.523]  This is a communist.
[02:28:55.214 --> 02:29:04.102]  I had a black communist here a while back who thought because I didn't like these wars and torture and stuff that he goes, no, you're a libertarian socialist.
[02:29:04.102 --> 02:29:07.906]  And I said, no, I'm a constitutionalist libertarian who believes in the free market.
[02:29:07.906 --> 02:29:09.407]  He goes, no, you're not.
[02:29:09.407 --> 02:29:15.213]  And then we went out and had dinner and he had a few beers and he told me, he looked across and he said, I'm not even going to air the interviews I did.
[02:29:15.213 --> 02:29:18.015]  I just don't want to get off into it.
[02:29:18.015 --> 02:29:20.838]  And he said, there's got to be blood and more blood and blood's coming.
[02:29:23.319 --> 02:29:30.162]  But with him, it was people with money, and I'm just like going, people with money, once you kill all them, there's not going to be anybody to actually organize.
[02:29:30.162 --> 02:29:34.784]  I mean, middle class real money is what makes a wealthy country.
[02:29:34.784 --> 02:29:38.065]  And it's the big bankers that are funding this idea.
[02:29:38.065 --> 02:29:40.366]  So we'll come back.
[02:29:40.366 --> 02:29:43.187]  New Black Panther Party calling for burning U.S.
[02:29:43.187 --> 02:29:44.148]  cities.
[02:29:44.148 --> 02:29:48.449]  The police are doing nothing, which means they're aiding and abetting it.
[02:29:48.449 --> 02:29:49.250]  The Florida police
[02:29:50.407 --> 02:29:54.333]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.333 --> 02:29:57.016]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.115 --> 02:30:08.338]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[02:30:08.338 --> 02:30:26.224]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:30:26.224 --> 02:30:30.326]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[02:30:30.606 --> 02:30:32.386]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[02:30:32.386 --> 02:30:40.528]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[02:31:59.885 --> 02:32:05.147]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:05.147 --> 02:32:09.489]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:09.489 --> 02:32:14.871]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:15.231 --> 02:32:15.971]  It's true.
[02:32:15.971 --> 02:32:21.673]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:21.673 --> 02:32:25.254]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:25.254 --> 02:32:29.975]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:29.975 --> 02:32:32.736]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:32.736 --> 02:32:36.077]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:36.397 --> 02:32:41.342]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:41.342 --> 02:32:46.406]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:46.406 --> 02:32:50.570]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:33:09.627 --> 02:33:15.630]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:32.555 --> 02:33:55.322]  Alright, I'll continue with your calls and some other important news here on this Live Monday edition, but... Again, it's one thing to know Obama and his controllers, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, are trying to get the American people at each other's throats, that we're in a depression, they're starting all these new wars, and they did say they weren't gonna attack Iran, now they flip-flopped and say they probably will.
[02:33:55.322 --> 02:33:57.722]  I mean, just craziness.
[02:33:57.722 --> 02:34:00.163]  But it's just amazing
[02:34:02.062 --> 02:34:09.185]  To actually see MSNBC and NBC editing tapes to make Zimmerman sound like he hates black people.
[02:34:09.185 --> 02:34:12.866]  And the media hyping this, trying to get a race war going.
[02:34:12.866 --> 02:34:21.670]  And then these feds, these different New Black Panther Party leaders in its speeches saying, I'm mad that Florida isn't on fire.
[02:34:21.670 --> 02:34:23.991]  And I want some white blood dripping.
[02:34:23.991 --> 02:34:25.852]  We need to kill some white people.
[02:34:28.348 --> 02:34:41.538]  And the Justice Department is down there investigating George Zimmerman and Al Sharpton saying, do you want violence?
[02:34:41.538 --> 02:34:48.063]  And then I get these weird comments on the YouTube and the site going, oh, Alex the Whitey is scared, saying we should come together.
[02:34:48.063 --> 02:34:48.784]  You're going to get it.
[02:34:48.784 --> 02:34:52.467]  I mean, it's so mindless.
[02:34:52.467 --> 02:34:55.269]  Like I'm scared that you're going to burn down your neighborhoods?
[02:34:56.778 --> 02:34:59.619]  And make all the culture and society scared of you?
[02:34:59.619 --> 02:35:00.860]  And nobody want to work with you?
[02:35:00.860 --> 02:35:11.645]  I mean, I am scared for our society, like what Hal Turner was trying to get a race for going, from the white supremacist angle, working for the feds.
[02:35:13.643 --> 02:35:21.547]  Because if we ever get together and go after the New World Order, we could actually, you know, get out of the grips of people that are putting GMO food on all the shelves.
[02:35:21.547 --> 02:35:29.811]  Whether you're black or white or Asian or whatever you call yourself, Native American, Indian, whatever you call yourself, this stuff's hurting you and your family.
[02:35:29.811 --> 02:35:31.751]  And you know, I just want to live in peace.
[02:35:31.751 --> 02:35:36.274]  I just don't want to be an evil person.
[02:35:36.274 --> 02:35:40.996]  So no, the magic race war where the black people kill all the whites.
[02:35:42.310 --> 02:35:46.477]  And we all live in, you know, our own separate areas after that.
[02:35:46.477 --> 02:35:47.499]  That's not going to happen.
[02:35:49.977 --> 02:36:00.325]  The globalists do want to break off part of the Southwest and make it kind of a socialist slash Hispanic kingdom, where whites and others still live there, but that's the political bent.
[02:36:00.325 --> 02:36:07.010]  Attaching socialism to being Hispanic, that's a big Ford Foundation plan, and that could actually work.
[02:36:07.010 --> 02:36:09.471]  And of course be a nightmare for those living under it, but whatever.
[02:36:09.471 --> 02:36:14.615]  There'll be this racial pride of the larger union, but within it, enclaves.
[02:36:14.615 --> 02:36:16.537]  See, the globalists merge countries
[02:36:17.588 --> 02:36:17.808]  We're good.
[02:36:33.846 --> 02:36:38.888]  And it's just so silly that when somebody says, hey, let's just get along.
[02:36:38.888 --> 02:36:42.070]  This is a tragedy, but the media is hyping it.
[02:36:42.070 --> 02:36:43.750]  That itself is a hoax.
[02:36:43.750 --> 02:36:45.311]  Let's talk about real issues.
[02:36:45.311 --> 02:36:49.813]  And it's like, I don't want to hear about black babies being aborted.
[02:36:49.813 --> 02:36:51.174]  It's you racist whites.
[02:36:51.174 --> 02:36:53.935]  We're going to kill you.
[02:36:53.935 --> 02:36:59.137]  Because the media says be upset about Trayvon Martin.
[02:36:59.137 --> 02:37:02.899]  You're upset about that, but you can't get upset about all the other really serious stuff.
[02:37:04.116 --> 02:37:15.003]  And that's my point, why do we let the mainstream media, who's trying, ridiculously obviously, I mean it's so obvious they're trying to get some cities burning.
[02:37:15.003 --> 02:37:23.628]  And now they can't get their fed, New Black Panther Party people, can't get riots going, so they're like, I'm angry!
[02:37:23.628 --> 02:37:26.050]  I want Florida in fire now!
[02:37:26.050 --> 02:37:28.231]  Start killing Whitey now!
[02:37:28.231 --> 02:37:28.952]  I am angry!
[02:37:30.854 --> 02:37:42.137]  I always love how these guys that want everybody to do violence, I always have these provocateurs email me and comment and send me letters and go, you're a coward, Jones, not calling for a military war with the police and military.
[02:37:42.137 --> 02:37:44.278]  You're a coward not saying march on D.C.
[02:37:44.278 --> 02:37:45.878]  with our guns.
[02:37:45.878 --> 02:37:48.859]  And of course, those people never march.
[02:37:48.859 --> 02:37:49.979]  They never go out.
[02:37:49.979 --> 02:37:53.500]  They want me to shoot my mouth off so they can arrest me.
[02:37:55.664 --> 02:38:01.126]  Even if I could lead an armed revolution and quote, get away with it, it'd be incredibly dangerous.
[02:38:01.126 --> 02:38:04.187]  Because we'd probably end up getting something worse out of it.
[02:38:04.187 --> 02:38:06.808]  Generally, violent revolutions do that.
[02:38:06.808 --> 02:38:12.330]  We need to have a revolution of ideas and start saying no to tyranny and non-compliance.
[02:38:12.330 --> 02:38:16.512]  And then, if they come to your house to burn it down like Waco, you defend yourself.
[02:38:18.806 --> 02:38:29.653]  You defensively, and that means once they start a fight with you, then you take the offense to them, whoever's doing it, but they still started it, so you're on the defense.
[02:38:29.653 --> 02:38:31.214]  You understand that?
[02:38:31.214 --> 02:38:32.695]  That's how that works.
[02:38:32.695 --> 02:38:42.942]  But I'm not like, I've seen enough violence, been around enough, know enough history that I'm not looking forward to once the real craziness starts, and it probably will.
[02:38:44.438 --> 02:38:47.180]  The New World Order's got big plans to break this country up.
[02:38:47.180 --> 02:38:49.701]  They've always had those plans.
[02:38:49.701 --> 02:38:52.422]  But it's not going to be on these racial lines that people dream of.
[02:38:52.422 --> 02:38:59.026]  It's going to be along economic and political lines.
[02:38:59.026 --> 02:39:01.687]  And that's the plan.
[02:39:01.687 --> 02:39:04.449]  The end of America as we know it pretty much has already happened.
[02:39:05.267 --> 02:39:08.989]  Let's go ahead and go to the cuss words edited.
[02:39:08.989 --> 02:39:13.452]  This is, again, warning strong language, but we've bleeped it out.
[02:39:13.452 --> 02:39:16.635]  It's up at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:39:16.635 --> 02:39:20.637]  Here is the new Black Panther Party at exchange of speeches.
[02:39:20.637 --> 02:39:22.779]  And again, the different names of the people and all that.
[02:39:23.879 --> 02:39:25.681]  Uh, are in the town hall meeting.
[02:39:25.681 --> 02:39:27.102]  Kurt Nemo's got an article.
[02:39:27.102 --> 02:39:30.304]  The Black Panthers and Nazis hijacked Trayvon Martin case.
[02:39:30.304 --> 02:39:32.225]  Oh yeah, they're involved as well.
[02:39:32.225 --> 02:39:33.086]  Uh, should have added that.
[02:39:33.086 --> 02:39:37.489]  Uh, but again, it's the leftist media angle from the left.
[02:39:37.489 --> 02:39:43.133]  Left-right paradigm's false, but within the left-right paradigm, they're, they're from a left perspective.
[02:39:43.133 --> 02:39:50.898]  They're pushing with moral authority violence in the news media from a righteous anger perspective.
[02:39:50.898 --> 02:39:51.679]  Now, here's another one.
[02:39:51.679 --> 02:39:52.740]  Uh, new Black Panthers
[02:39:56.055 --> 02:40:01.619]  Booted, suited, and armed for coming race war.
[02:40:01.619 --> 02:40:15.770]  And that's by Michelle Williams and Sean Quali, the chief of staff in Tampa, a national spokesman.
[02:40:15.770 --> 02:40:21.075]  Respectively, the call was filled with violence, hate-filled speech.
[02:40:21.075 --> 02:40:24.777]  See, notice how even Breitbart
[02:40:25.799 --> 02:40:28.681]  Picks up this nomenclature of hate speech.
[02:40:28.681 --> 02:40:29.222]  No, no.
[02:40:29.222 --> 02:40:33.845]  Hate speech is when they say, I hate the banksters, the New World Order, a bunch of criminals.
[02:40:33.845 --> 02:40:36.007]  They say, we should ban that hate speech.
[02:40:36.007 --> 02:40:46.234]  So they create a word for free speech, and then when people say kill people, which is a call to action, terroristic threat, violence, and racketeering, organized crime.
[02:40:46.234 --> 02:40:48.656]  They're trying to organize people to commit crime.
[02:40:48.656 --> 02:40:49.657]  That's mafia.
[02:40:49.657 --> 02:40:50.878]  That's organized racketeering.
[02:40:52.967 --> 02:40:54.808]  They call it hate speech.
[02:40:54.808 --> 02:40:59.269]  So now when they legally call me hate speech, people are like, ooh, that's terrible.
[02:40:59.269 --> 02:41:02.830]  You see, so they call people, oh, these are radicals.
[02:41:02.830 --> 02:41:04.471]  They're calling for murder and death.
[02:41:04.471 --> 02:41:07.311]  No, they're not radicals.
[02:41:07.311 --> 02:41:10.352]  They're calling for terroristic acts.
[02:41:10.352 --> 02:41:21.936]  See, so they use a label that's too weak on these people because then that'll blur the lines of the label when they use it on people like Alex Jones, saying I have hate speech, because I say I hate the New World Order.
[02:41:24.810 --> 02:41:30.633]  No, this isn't hate speech, and stop using the political correctness commissariate language.
[02:41:30.633 --> 02:41:33.835]  I got Glenn Beck here using it, Breitbart using it.
[02:41:33.835 --> 02:41:37.237]  That is not what's going on.
[02:41:37.237 --> 02:41:49.464]  They are calling for organized criminal violence, and that's called, if it's against a government that's clearly corrupt and evil, it's called a resistance movement.
[02:41:50.525 --> 02:41:52.487]  And the government's going to call it terrorism.
[02:41:52.487 --> 02:42:06.476]  But when it's just against racial groups, it's called genocidal intent, a crime against humanity, a terroristic threat, a racketeering, organized criminal activity.
[02:42:06.476 --> 02:42:10.679]  This is racketeering that you are about to hear.
[02:42:10.679 --> 02:42:13.521]  And the FBI probably runs this group.
[02:42:13.521 --> 02:42:14.782]  That's why they're not going to stop them.
[02:42:14.782 --> 02:42:16.643]  And the local police are going to do what the FBI tells them.
[02:42:17.816 --> 02:42:23.339]  The people that said this stuff should be arrested.
[02:42:23.339 --> 02:42:30.122]  If I said this because I'm not a fed, I would be arrested so fast it'd make your head spin.
[02:42:30.122 --> 02:42:31.083]  Let's go ahead and go to the tape.
[02:42:31.083 --> 02:42:31.403]  Here it is.
[02:42:38.857 --> 02:42:51.520]  But Al, I just want to say to all the listeners that's on this phone call, if you are having any doubt about getting suited, booted, and armed up for this race war that we in, that has never ended, let me tell you something.
[02:42:51.520 --> 02:43:03.402]  The things that's about to happen to these hunkies, these crackos, these pigs, these pink people, these mother f***er people, it has been long overdue.
[02:43:03.402 --> 02:43:05.223]  Yeah, but what she said was right.
[02:43:05.223 --> 02:43:06.703]  We got to suit up and boot up.
[02:43:07.620 --> 02:43:09.781]  We got to suit up and boot up.
[02:43:42.154 --> 02:43:45.877]  Any white supremacist that get away with talking like that are feds as well.
[02:43:45.877 --> 02:43:56.607]  The Hattari, because they weren't white supremacists and were just preparing to defend themselves, were arrested for saying a day may come where we have to defend ourselves from the government.
[02:43:56.607 --> 02:44:00.430]  That's totally constitutionally protected and the judge just dropped the case.
[02:44:00.430 --> 02:44:06.375]  Feds are still holding him, he's a bunch of criminals at that level.
[02:44:06.375 --> 02:44:08.096]  Go back to the tape, this is just so amazing.
[02:44:08.096 --> 02:44:08.677]  Please continue.
[02:44:12.461 --> 02:44:15.704]  And get prepared for the war that we're in.
[02:44:15.704 --> 02:44:17.765]  This stuff got to boil over.
[02:44:17.765 --> 02:44:23.189]  And all your greats talked about there having to be bloodshed involved with revolution.
[02:44:23.189 --> 02:44:25.531]  True revolution means some bloodshed.
[02:44:25.531 --> 02:44:30.895]  So there's blood being spilled because there's a new life that is beyond this bloodshed.
[02:44:30.895 --> 02:44:40.082]  There's a new reality that is built upon your original African principles and spiritualities and values and norms that is beyond this bloodshed.
[02:44:40.082 --> 02:44:41.243]  But we got to go through it.
[02:44:41.681 --> 02:44:43.824]  And as the scriptures say, you gotta cross.
[02:44:43.824 --> 02:44:47.229]  We're gonna have to cross the Red Sea.
[02:44:47.229 --> 02:44:50.773]  You're gonna have to cross the Red Sea.
[02:44:50.773 --> 02:44:54.738]  I know y'all thought I was talking about... Alright, look, I want to play this without stopping it.
[02:44:54.738 --> 02:44:57.802]  Okay, because this is unedited except for the cuss words bleeped out.
[02:44:58.854 --> 02:45:17.329]  But again, every group, from the Nazis to the Communists to some of the extreme Zionists, every one of these groups says they're the supreme group, all culture comes from them, and that everybody else, Mechel Arraza says this, every other group is trash and all culture came from their group.
[02:45:17.329 --> 02:45:20.411]  And they don't like violence, but they've got to do it.
[02:45:20.411 --> 02:45:23.133]  Every racial supremacy group does this.
[02:45:24.222 --> 02:45:25.944]  And the globalists just love it.
[02:45:25.944 --> 02:45:28.086]  They just sit back and play us off against each other.
[02:45:28.086 --> 02:45:30.729]  And again, who's trying to help get the race war going?
[02:45:30.729 --> 02:45:33.872]  MSNBC and the White House.
[02:45:33.872 --> 02:45:35.154]  This is Divide and Conquer.
[02:45:35.154 --> 02:45:36.775]  I'm going to play it unedited and then we're going to break.
[02:45:36.775 --> 02:45:37.075]  Here it is.
[02:45:45.035 --> 02:45:57.701]  But Al, I just want to say to all the listeners that's on this phone call, if you are having any doubts about getting suited, booted, and armed up for this race war that we're in, that has never ended, let me tell you something.
[02:45:57.701 --> 02:46:09.567]  The things that's about to happen to these hunkies, these crackers, these pigs, these pink people, these mother f***er people, it has been long overdue.
[02:46:09.567 --> 02:46:11.408]  Yeah, what she said was right.
[02:46:11.408 --> 02:46:13.629]  We got to suit up and boot up.
[02:46:13.629 --> 02:46:14.630]  We got to suit up
[02:46:15.353 --> 02:46:19.816]  And get prepared for the war that we're in.
[02:46:19.816 --> 02:46:21.858]  This stuff got to boil over.
[02:46:21.858 --> 02:46:27.281]  And all your greats talked about there having to be bloodshed involved with revolution.
[02:46:27.281 --> 02:46:29.603]  True revolution means some bloodshed.
[02:46:29.603 --> 02:46:34.987]  So there's blood being spilled because there's a new life that is beyond this bloodshed.
[02:46:34.987 --> 02:46:43.773]  There's a new reality that is built upon your original African principles and spiritualities and values and norms that is beyond this bloodshed.
[02:46:44.178 --> 02:46:45.039]  But we gotta go do it.
[02:46:57.927 --> 02:46:59.227]  Middle Eastern part of the world.
[02:46:59.227 --> 02:47:00.208]  Hell no!
[02:47:00.208 --> 02:47:02.328]  We're talking about some blood.
[02:47:02.328 --> 02:47:19.254]  You're gonna have to cross some blood and go through some blood and some battles and there are those who wish they could stand in this hour to see the destruction of the devil's world and the devil's society and I ain't talking about no dude underneath the ground with a pitchfork and pantyhose.
[02:47:19.734 --> 02:47:30.937]  I'm talking about that blonde-haired, blue-eyed, sometimes brown-eyed, Caucasian walking around with a mindset, a demonistic mindset, and the nature to do evil and brutality.
[02:47:30.937 --> 02:47:39.839]  I say to everyone that is on this call right now, I'm coming out of the gates like that greyhound on that rabbit.
[02:47:39.839 --> 02:47:48.702]  And his prize, my prize right now, this evening, is going to be the bounty, the arrest, dead or alive, for George Zimmerman.
[02:47:48.702 --> 02:47:49.202]  You feel me?
[02:47:50.218 --> 02:47:51.659]  Hit pause, I can't help it.
[02:47:51.659 --> 02:47:55.061]  Back it up 10 seconds so they hear it unedited.
[02:47:55.061 --> 02:47:55.781]  Arrest her right now.
[02:47:55.781 --> 02:47:56.141]  Arrest her.
[02:47:56.141 --> 02:47:57.242]  She just called for violence.
[02:47:57.242 --> 02:47:59.183]  She said dead or alive, go get him.
[02:47:59.183 --> 02:48:00.023]  And it goes on and on.
[02:48:00.023 --> 02:48:02.384]  But they're fed runs so they won't get in trouble.
[02:48:19.620 --> 02:48:21.221]  This government is so sick.
[02:48:21.221 --> 02:48:23.102]  And that's why you'll never get our guns.
[02:48:23.102 --> 02:48:28.104]  The system would love to take our guns, like they do in Africa, and then play groups off against each other.
[02:48:28.104 --> 02:48:30.225]  And there they'll do Muslim versus Christian.
[02:48:30.225 --> 02:48:32.987]  I mean, it's so sick!
[02:48:32.987 --> 02:48:39.590]  And they've got their white supremacist counterparts fed run, but they're not allowed to say it that much because it's a little too obvious.
[02:48:39.590 --> 02:48:41.831]  But they're all working on the same team.
[02:48:41.831 --> 02:48:42.852]  Let's go back to the clip.
[02:48:42.852 --> 02:48:43.172]  Here it is.
[02:48:44.703 --> 02:48:54.707]  And his prize, my prize right now, this evening, is going to be the bounty, the arrest, dead or alive, for George Zimmerman.
[02:48:54.707 --> 02:48:55.807]  You feel me?
[02:48:55.807 --> 02:49:00.409]  To every brother, to every female, I am for violence.
[02:49:00.409 --> 02:49:08.572]  If nonviolence means we continue to postpone a solution to the American black man's problem, just to avoid violence.
[02:49:08.572 --> 02:49:10.113]  You feel me?
[02:49:10.113 --> 02:49:11.534]  It's time to wake up.
[02:49:11.534 --> 02:49:12.474]  I don't know how else
[02:49:13.605 --> 02:49:15.086]  It's in me to fight.
[02:49:15.086 --> 02:49:17.568]  It's in me to raise up soldiers.
[02:49:17.568 --> 02:49:23.472]  It's in me that every time my feet touch the ground, the state of Florida, these crackers, they're scared.
[02:49:23.472 --> 02:49:28.015]  I'm telling you right now, I'm kind of pissed off right now that the state of Florida ain't on fire.
[02:49:28.015 --> 02:49:30.197]  This could not have happened in L.A.
[02:49:30.197 --> 02:49:33.179]  because them brothers up there are not scared to riot.
[02:49:33.179 --> 02:49:35.080]  This could not have happened in St.
[02:49:35.080 --> 02:49:40.083]  Petersburg, Florida, where the black man over there ain't scared to kill a cracker.
[02:49:40.083 --> 02:49:40.544]  This is real.
[02:49:41.141 --> 02:49:42.602]  We're attacked anywhere in the world.
[02:49:42.602 --> 02:49:45.625]  We would defend ourselves by any means necessary.
[02:49:45.625 --> 02:49:54.092]  We have proposed and we're pushing forward with a national strike and walkout on this crackhead, on this beast, and on these bastards.
[02:49:54.092 --> 02:49:58.896]  We are proposing and pushing for our people that you hit them in the pocket where it hurts.
[02:49:58.896 --> 02:50:00.878]  You starve capitalism.
[02:50:01.334 --> 02:50:14.629]  Since this racism that's being perpetuated, and this brutality that's being perpetuated, and this murder that's being perpetuated is built on the table legs of capitalism, you got to starve capitalism.
[02:50:15.639 --> 02:50:17.280]  What you're saying is real.
[02:50:17.280 --> 02:50:19.480]  An act of war has been declared on us.
[02:50:19.480 --> 02:50:21.861]  We don't have no choice but to fight.
[02:50:21.861 --> 02:50:25.922]  But I want to say that we have to be trained how to fight.
[02:50:25.922 --> 02:50:31.583]  See, the whole purpose of the maneuvers that's happening in Sanford is to train in self-defense.
[02:50:31.583 --> 02:50:33.964]  Because many of us think we're prepared for a battle.
[02:50:34.693 --> 02:50:36.894]  Just like many other things, we're prepared for a fight.
[02:50:36.894 --> 02:50:55.045]  But if you are not training, if you're not stocking up water, if you're not stocking up food, if you're not stocking up weapons and artillery and survival books and gas masks and flashlights and canteens and ready-to-eat meals and all that stuff, if you're not stocking that up, I don't know what to tell you.
[02:50:55.045 --> 02:50:56.626]  Alright, we'll come back with the rest of it.
[02:50:56.626 --> 02:50:58.126]  We'll be right back after this break.
[02:50:58.126 --> 02:50:59.567]  See, the end part's actually good.
[02:50:59.567 --> 02:51:00.528]  Everybody should be prepared.
[02:51:01.417 --> 02:51:02.838]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:51:02.838 --> 02:51:13.489]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[02:51:13.489 --> 02:51:17.593]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[02:51:17.953 --> 02:51:20.695]  But we can't do that without your help.
[02:51:20.695 --> 02:51:31.962]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[02:51:31.962 --> 02:51:35.124]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[02:51:35.444 --> 02:51:41.607]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[02:51:41.607 --> 02:51:51.491]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[02:51:51.491 --> 02:51:52.992]  The war is here.
[02:51:52.992 --> 02:51:54.892]  It's an info war.
[02:51:54.892 --> 02:51:56.833]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[02:52:02.250 --> 02:52:04.111]  Don't answer it!

[02:53:00.894 --> 02:53:03.155]  Introducing a diabetes breakthrough.
[02:53:03.155 --> 02:53:06.758]  An easy, natural, organic way to bring relief to diabetics.
[02:53:06.758 --> 02:53:08.719]  Introducing MDS Forte.
[02:53:08.719 --> 02:53:12.741]  A concentrated super strength extract formulated for those who are looking for relief.
[02:53:12.741 --> 02:53:14.802]  What can MDS Forte do for you?
[02:53:14.802 --> 02:53:17.724]  MDS Forte reduces glucose levels safely and effectively.
[02:53:17.944 --> 02:53:18.284]  I think so.
[02:53:38.163 --> 02:53:39.984]  Waiting for the side effects disclaimers?
[02:53:39.984 --> 02:53:42.464]  With MDS Forte, there are none.

[02:54:01.611 --> 02:54:05.952]  You walk into this room at your own risk because it leads to the future.
[02:54:06.733 --> 02:54:10.175]  Not a future that will be, but one that might be.
[02:54:10.175 --> 02:54:12.436]  This is not a new world.
[02:54:12.436 --> 02:54:16.839]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[02:54:16.839 --> 02:54:25.264]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[02:54:25.264 --> 02:54:33.328]  It has refinements, technological advances, and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.
[02:54:33.328 --> 02:54:35.790]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it,
[02:54:36.511 --> 02:54:39.032]  It has one iron rule.
[02:54:39.032 --> 02:54:50.137]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[02:54:50.137 --> 02:54:52.898]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:54:52.898 --> 02:54:57.661]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:57.661 --> 02:55:05.004]  I want to lay some truth on you here.
[02:55:09.952 --> 02:55:17.198]  There are organized racial criminal groups of every religion, race, region of the world.
[02:55:17.198 --> 02:55:24.584]  And they all get away with it because they say, we do the bad things we do because that other group's going to get us if we don't.
[02:55:24.584 --> 02:55:31.830]  But by and large, those very groups controlling their minions are more abusive to their minions than even the outside group is.
[02:55:31.830 --> 02:55:35.653]  But people put up with it because they see it as the group doing it to them.
[02:55:37.822 --> 02:55:48.046]  And that's why, yeah, there's corruption in different countries and problems, but when the globalists say, oh, attack this country, they're evil, they're not trying to attack them to bring liberty or freedom to those countries.
[02:55:48.046 --> 02:55:51.367]  They're trying to attack them so they can basically just steal their resources.
[02:55:54.554 --> 02:56:17.478]  And when you look at this type of balkanization happening here in the U.S., here is MSNBC editing tapes, here's the White House pushing this, here's every news channel trying to get a race war going, and you've got the new Black Panther Party saying things that anybody else would be arrested, and saying, get out there and kill some crackers.
[02:56:17.478 --> 02:56:19.499]  Just start killing some white people.
[02:56:19.499 --> 02:56:21.479]  Kill some blonde-haired, blue-eyed people.
[02:56:21.479 --> 02:56:21.859]  Kill them!
[02:56:23.444 --> 02:56:25.605]  And at the end they say, and by the way, get prepared.
[02:56:25.605 --> 02:56:27.166]  That's a script been written for them.
[02:56:27.166 --> 02:56:30.168]  So they can then demonize people getting prepared.
[02:56:30.168 --> 02:56:34.610]  And then it's, yeah, these crackers are scared when our feet touch the ground.
[02:56:34.610 --> 02:56:37.091]  Well, yeah, I mean, it may scare little old ladies and stuff.
[02:56:37.091 --> 02:56:40.233]  And I imagine people are going to see this all over the news.
[02:56:40.233 --> 02:56:47.897]  And they're going to be scared now of the poor black guy that comes to their house to install dish network or something.
[02:56:50.236 --> 02:56:56.539]  Or the poor black plumber that comes to their house as a Christian and got a bunch of kids at home they're trying to take care of and keep out of trouble.
[02:56:56.539 --> 02:56:59.521]  And it's going to make black people not trust the white guy that comes to their house.
[02:56:59.521 --> 02:57:02.162]  I'm just so sick of it all.
[02:57:02.162 --> 02:57:05.864]  I am so sick of cowardly scum.
[02:57:05.864 --> 02:57:10.787]  White supremacists, black supremacists, Mexican supremacists, the universities all teach this stuff.
[02:57:12.686 --> 02:57:17.247]  The Mexican slash Black Supremacist stuff trying to get us to all fight with each other.
[02:57:17.247 --> 02:57:19.548]  Let's go ahead and finish the last minute we didn't get to.
[02:57:19.548 --> 02:57:21.008]  We backed it up a bit.
[02:57:21.008 --> 02:57:23.689]  Here's more of it where he gets into the preparedness stuff.
[02:57:23.689 --> 02:57:25.989]  This is real.
[02:57:25.989 --> 02:57:27.410]  We're attacked anyway in the world.
[02:57:27.410 --> 02:57:30.430]  We would defend ourselves by any means necessary.
[02:57:30.430 --> 02:57:32.951]  We... Now hit pause there.
[02:57:32.951 --> 02:57:36.212]  See, before they're saying kill, offensively kill crackers.
[02:57:36.212 --> 02:57:37.672]  Now it's we'll defend ourselves.
[02:57:37.672 --> 02:57:38.812]  That's totally different.
[02:57:38.812 --> 02:57:40.813]  See, they're mixing the two together.
[02:57:40.813 --> 02:57:41.213]  Continue.
[02:57:42.991 --> 02:57:53.319]  We are proposing and pushing for our people that you hit them in the pocket where it hurts.
[02:57:53.319 --> 02:57:55.800]  You starve capitalism.
[02:57:55.800 --> 02:58:09.071]  Since this racism that's being perpetuated, and this brutality that's being perpetuated, and this murder that's being perpetuated is built on the table legs of capitalism, you got to starve capitalism.
[02:58:10.210 --> 02:58:10.771]  That's enough.
[02:58:10.771 --> 02:58:11.832]  Look, look, look.
[02:58:11.832 --> 02:58:14.013]  I'll post the whole thing up at Infowars.com.
[02:58:14.013 --> 02:58:15.194]  Let me just say this.
[02:58:15.194 --> 02:58:19.658]  They've built a lot of businesses in East Austin, and a lot of the food and stuff's good.
[02:58:19.658 --> 02:58:23.501]  And they've gotten the white yuppies to believe it's good, because it is overall.
[02:58:23.501 --> 02:58:26.484]  Go to East Austin, the black area, and buy things.
[02:58:26.484 --> 02:58:29.146]  And there's been grants, and they've built it up, and it's nice.
[02:58:29.146 --> 02:58:32.669]  All this racial stuff starts, you just won't have the wicked little crackers over there.
[02:58:33.955 --> 02:58:34.836]  And then what does that do?
[02:58:34.836 --> 02:58:36.297]  It hurts everybody.
[02:58:36.297 --> 02:58:42.264]  Again, this is all divide and conquer and it shows the globalists are desperate.
[02:58:42.264 --> 02:58:46.248]  They want to pose as the saviors of the crisis they create.
