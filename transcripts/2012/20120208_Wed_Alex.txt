[00:00:05.126 --> 00:00:06.427]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.427 --> 00:00:08.207]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.207 --> 00:00:09.948]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.948 --> 00:00:11.548]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.548 --> 00:00:13.089]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:17.290]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.391]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:34.226]  All right, my friends.
[00:00:34.226 --> 00:00:46.259]  Israeli, Russian, and Iranian news sources, mainline news sources, are reporting that Russian troops, special forces, Spetsnaz, are being deployed.
[00:00:47.372 --> 00:00:50.494]  By the thousands into Syria.
[00:00:50.494 --> 00:01:08.703]  There's a report out of Herat that we blurbed, it's up on DrudgeReport.com, that the Iranian news, and I went and linked through, sure enough they are reporting it, is saying that 15,000 of their Revolutionary Guard have already been deployed.
[00:01:08.703 --> 00:01:13.766]  Top Iran military official aiding Assad's crackdown on Syrian opposition.
[00:01:15.188 --> 00:01:18.290]  Of course, Hillary and others promised there'd never be U.S.
[00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.212]  or NATO intervention militarily.
[00:01:20.212 --> 00:01:25.856]  Now they're calling for it, and it's come out in a lot of major publications in the last two weeks that U.S.
[00:01:25.856 --> 00:01:31.780]  and NATO forces have actually been inserted in different border regions and are involved.
[00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.641]  So this is serious.
[00:01:33.641 --> 00:01:40.306]  The Russian foreign minister is obviously saying again today, don't get involved, don't attack, or we're going to get involved.
[00:01:40.306 --> 00:01:41.887]  This is unprecedented.
[00:01:42.848 --> 00:01:50.812]  Cuban missile crisis level type stuff that we're seeing happening right now.
[00:01:50.812 --> 00:02:00.597]  And because we've been talking about it so long, now that we're getting right up to the wire on it, everybody's pretty much just acclimated to accept this.
[00:02:00.597 --> 00:02:03.979]  Russia's Putin warns against outside interference.
[00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.062]  Russia's Prime Minister says West cannot behave like elephant in a china shop in Syria.
[00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:10.643]  Their foreign minister
[00:02:13.238 --> 00:02:24.702]  has come out and is meeting again with Damascus yesterday and is saying that they are going to respond and block outside Western intervention.
[00:02:24.702 --> 00:02:26.223]  This is incredible.
[00:02:26.223 --> 00:02:32.085]  Israeli embassies preparing for Iran attack and this article is up on Infowars.com from
[00:02:38.724 --> 00:02:55.830]  Reports inside Israel foreign press is running Tel Aviv rooftops to cover Iran war and Fox News ABC NBC BBC They've all got their advanced teams on the ground.
[00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:07.034]  The Israeli news is reporting and are now running rooftops It is really barreling down to the line They are massing US troops in Kuwait Israel
[00:03:08.274 --> 00:03:08.614]  I think?
[00:03:38.055 --> 00:03:41.360]  Counter-strikes look like.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.647]  And I don't just believe British, French, Israeli and U.S.
[00:03:46.647 --> 00:03:53.356]  newspapers when they say that the Ayatollahs talking about attacking the West or
[00:03:56.289 --> 00:04:01.076]  The leader of the military saying we're going to strike and attack and respond.
[00:04:01.076 --> 00:04:05.122]  I actually go look it up and they are indeed saying this.
[00:04:05.122 --> 00:04:08.466]  So Iran is going now into a posture of war.
[00:04:10.234 --> 00:04:21.363]  And I think it finally got their attention having their military bases blown up, their rocket bases blown up, their generals killed, their police academies blown up, their military academies blown up.
[00:04:21.363 --> 00:04:23.124]  Some of these explosions are so big.
[00:04:23.124 --> 00:04:25.506]  These are not truck bombs.
[00:04:25.506 --> 00:04:28.328]  These are not people throwing satchels over walls.
[00:04:28.328 --> 00:04:31.430]  I've seen some of the satellite photos of these bases.
[00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.273]  These have got to be 2,000 pound bombs, bare minimum.
[00:04:35.273 --> 00:04:36.955]  They're stealth bombers dropping bombs on them.
[00:04:37.921 --> 00:04:41.163]  Or some type of missiles are flying in under the radar.
[00:04:41.163 --> 00:04:42.123]  Cruise missiles, I don't know.
[00:04:42.123 --> 00:04:44.605]  But if they're cruise missiles, they're big.
[00:04:44.605 --> 00:04:47.286]  I mean, Iran is under bombardment.
[00:04:47.286 --> 00:04:52.709]  And they got motorcycle assassins with the magnet bombs, magnet mines.
[00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:53.509]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:55.650]  It's just, it's already started.
[00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.712]  The Russians are lining up.
[00:04:57.712 --> 00:04:58.252]  Be involved.
[00:05:01.627 --> 00:05:05.651]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:08.895]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:05:08.895 --> 00:05:13.700]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:20.087]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:05:20.087 --> 00:05:22.330]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:23.150]  Tim Geithner?
[00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.670]  Bernanke?
[00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:24.331]  They're arsonists!
[00:05:24.331 --> 00:05:25.591]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:27.872]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:49.044]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:05:49.044 --> 00:05:58.151]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.502]  I've been telling you about eFoods Direct for a while now.
[00:06:03.502 --> 00:06:07.184]  Here are my top 10 reasons to stock up on food from eFoods Direct.
[00:06:07.184 --> 00:06:07.684]  Number 10.
[00:06:07.684 --> 00:06:10.245]  The food I get from eFoods Direct tastes great.
[00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:11.006]  Number 9.
[00:06:11.006 --> 00:06:12.807]  The eFoods meals are easy to prepare.
[00:06:12.807 --> 00:06:16.729]  8. eFoods Direct delivers the food right to my front door.
[00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:17.049]  7.
[00:06:17.049 --> 00:06:19.010]  Most of these meals cost less than $2.
[00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.070]  6.
[00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.252]  With their large variety, I can eat it every day. 5.
[00:06:23.292 --> 00:06:26.473]  I always have access to high quality and delicious food.
[00:06:26.473 --> 00:06:30.454]  Number four, eFoods products don't spoil, so I never waste any food.
[00:06:30.454 --> 00:06:33.835]  Three, eFoods uses only safe, healthy ingredients.
[00:06:33.835 --> 00:06:38.156]  Number two, I have my own food supply and don't depend on the grocery store.
[00:06:38.156 --> 00:06:43.998]  And the number one reason I promote eFoods Direct is they build special offers just for my listeners.
[00:06:44.378 --> 00:06:45.319]  Folks, don't wait.
[00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:46.561]  Get prepared now.
[00:06:46.561 --> 00:06:48.523]  We all need to be self-sufficient.
[00:06:48.523 --> 00:06:51.105]  Call eFoodsDirect at 800-409-5633 and ask for the Alex Jones Special.
[00:06:51.105 --> 00:06:53.508]  Call eFoodsDirect at 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:07:01.195 --> 00:07:02.897]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:02.897 --> 00:07:08.225]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:07:08.225 --> 00:07:09.747]  Saving means to make money.
[00:07:09.747 --> 00:07:18.538]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:26.801]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:07:26.801 --> 00:07:34.803]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:07:34.803 --> 00:07:40.025]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:07:40.025 --> 00:07:42.185]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:07:44.946 --> 00:07:46.287]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:46.287 --> 00:07:48.328]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.037 --> 00:08:24.941]  All right, if you go to InfoWars.com, you can see our top stories right there, and they're all incredibly important.
[00:08:24.941 --> 00:08:27.422]  There's some positive news.
[00:08:27.422 --> 00:08:36.305]  There's also, of course, some ugly news, as well as dreadful news taking place.
[00:08:36.305 --> 00:08:40.867]  But we are going to cover it all here today.
[00:08:40.867 --> 00:08:42.128]  Obviously, our top
[00:08:43.285 --> 00:08:46.147]  This story is not a story at all.
[00:08:46.147 --> 00:09:02.836]  It affects every one of us, no matter where we live in the world, and it will undoubtedly be bad for our liberties, for the economy, from the price of gas to the price of food, and it's what you expect in every case in history.
[00:09:02.836 --> 00:09:06.238]  When depressions take place, governments start wars.
[00:09:07.939 --> 00:09:14.721]  And many statesmen have said it in different ways, but war is the health of the state.
[00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:18.543]  I search engine that, quote, war is the health of the state.
[00:09:18.543 --> 00:09:22.904]  I'm having a moment of not remembering exactly who said that.
[00:09:22.904 --> 00:09:23.965]  It's attributed to many.
[00:09:23.965 --> 00:09:27.046]  It's been said different ways, but war is the health of the state.
[00:09:27.046 --> 00:09:31.827]  And of course, that means big, corrupt, oppressive state.
[00:09:31.827 --> 00:09:32.768]  So we're going to be going over that.
[00:09:34.973 --> 00:09:40.597]  Obviously we need to get a little bit more into what's happening with campaign 2012.
[00:09:40.597 --> 00:09:42.859]  Clear evidence of election fraud.
[00:09:42.859 --> 00:09:47.283]  I'll cover some of that in the third hour with some of the graphs and documents.
[00:09:47.283 --> 00:09:51.346]  In Nevada, a few days into this, Ron Paul got 220% increases in one state, 160 in others.
[00:09:51.346 --> 00:09:54.469]  Always over 100% increase, bare minimum, in every state compared to what he got in 2008.
[00:10:02.503 --> 00:10:03.664]  In the last election.
[00:10:03.664 --> 00:10:05.125]  Except Nevada.
[00:10:05.125 --> 00:10:08.987]  He got the exact, exact amount.
[00:10:08.987 --> 00:10:13.710]  Like they were lazy and didn't even program the machines to show another fraud.
[00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:17.452]  The polls showed he was in the lead, first or second place, not third.
[00:10:17.452 --> 00:10:21.034]  A distant third.
[00:10:21.034 --> 00:10:22.795]  We of course saw fraud in Iowa.
[00:10:22.795 --> 00:10:26.798]  It was first reported the day after by our listeners and the weeks after it was confirmed.
[00:10:26.798 --> 00:10:28.479]  Associated Press headline?
[00:10:30.072 --> 00:10:32.512]  Iowa caucus results scrapped.
[00:10:32.512 --> 00:10:37.193]  And they said, we don't know who will get them now.
[00:10:37.193 --> 00:10:41.014]  Just a lot of bizarreness and trucks were missing with the ballots.
[00:10:41.014 --> 00:10:58.937]  How are trucks missing with the ballots after they were cast when they're all cast in the 1800 precincts or so and tallied and called in on a telephone in front of everyone and posted so everybody can check their caucus online when the Republicans put the results out and make sure it's what they saw.
[00:10:59.853 --> 00:11:05.476]  In many caucuses this time, they said, oh, we're just going to drive in the results and we're not going to publish them.
[00:11:05.476 --> 00:11:12.239]  Some did what they were supposed to, but any time you break with what's been done in the past, big red flags go up.
[00:11:12.239 --> 00:11:15.040]  And then we have bizarre statements by Karl Rove, later confirmed.
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:20.463]  Oh, there was a gentleman's agreement in all these precincts that we would make Santorum second and Ron Paul third.
[00:11:20.463 --> 00:11:21.723]  Remember that clip?
[00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:22.784]  He hides it.
[00:11:22.784 --> 00:11:25.965]  See, they hide this stuff in plain view.
[00:11:25.965 --> 00:11:27.166]  And they come out and say, oh, yeah.
[00:11:28.988 --> 00:11:31.450]  You know, some of the trucks didn't show up with the ballots.
[00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:35.154]  It was late, you know, later in the evening.
[00:11:35.154 --> 00:11:41.440]  So they all got together, the Romney and Semtorum's people, and had a gentleman's agreement on what they thought the results were.
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.322]  And he hid that in plain view.
[00:11:43.322 --> 00:11:50.389]  It was like saying, yeah, and we went in and pulled a gun on the bank teller and told him, put all the money in a bag and took it out.
[00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:52.411]  It was, you know, it was a gentleman's agreement.
[00:11:54.517 --> 00:12:10.372]  Now remember what Karl Rove told the New York Times and others, it's why it's so famous, it was a whole bunch of Washington Post, New York Times, writers all there at that cocktail party, and they said, but you did lie about the WMDs, you are taking liberties, you guys did order the torture, and now you're saying you didn't.
[00:12:10.372 --> 00:12:18.841]  And he said, listen, you are in the reality-based community, but we control reality now, we're an empire, and we'll make up whatever we want, and you'll accept it.
[00:12:20.035 --> 00:12:23.639]  And some of the reporters agreed with him, and a few got insulted and went and wrote about it.
[00:12:23.639 --> 00:12:27.043]  And Roe said, yeah, you bet, I control reality.
[00:12:27.043 --> 00:12:32.008]  So he'll just tell you, yeah, we decided who won.
[00:12:32.008 --> 00:12:37.634]  The ballots in all these precincts were missing in the truck.
[00:12:37.634 --> 00:12:38.475]  The trucks were missing.
[00:12:38.475 --> 00:12:41.017]  We don't know where they went.
[00:12:41.017 --> 00:12:41.998]  And Fox News
[00:12:43.035 --> 00:12:46.698]  You know, didn't ask their analyst, Karl Rove, they didn't ask him.
[00:12:46.698 --> 00:12:53.464]  Mr. Rove, they don't drive the ballots once they've been cast in the caucus system in Iowa.
[00:12:53.464 --> 00:12:55.585]  It's all published on the wall.
[00:12:55.585 --> 00:12:56.666]  It's publicly voted.
[00:12:56.666 --> 00:12:58.468]  They tally it in front of everybody.
[00:12:58.468 --> 00:13:00.490]  It's the most trusted form of voting.
[00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:02.511]  That's why folks knew Ron Paul would do well there.
[00:13:02.511 --> 00:13:08.957]  It was trending to be number one until the election, but magically number three.
[00:13:10.838 --> 00:13:11.839]  They didn't ask the question.
[00:13:11.839 --> 00:13:14.180]  They didn't ask, well, where was this smoky room?
[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:15.760]  Who made these decisions?
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.321]  It was just, oh, you've just given us the reality.
[00:13:18.321 --> 00:13:20.642]  Oh, you know what?
[00:13:20.642 --> 00:13:26.385]  And then a month later, oh, we have scrapped Iowa.
[00:13:26.385 --> 00:13:28.105]  We're not going to tell you what's going to happen.
[00:13:28.105 --> 00:13:28.986]  We'll decide later.
[00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:32.001]  Oh, just Iowa's scrapped.
[00:13:32.001 --> 00:13:33.182]  Well, okay.
[00:13:33.182 --> 00:13:39.067]  You don't like Ron Paul even having a third of the delegates, or being in third place, getting a big piece of the delegates.
[00:13:39.067 --> 00:13:44.290]  It was almost a statistical dead heat.
[00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:49.754]  And it was Rudolph Born said war is the health of the state.
[00:13:49.754 --> 00:13:57.099]  That's reportedly the... from a war diary, the Seven Arts, September 1917.
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:01.921]  Here it is.
[00:14:01.921 --> 00:14:04.002]  He said war is the health of the state.
[00:14:04.002 --> 00:14:18.215]  It automatically sets in motion throughout society those irresistible forces of uniformity for passionate cooperation with the government and coercing into obedience the majority groups and individuals with lack
[00:14:19.741 --> 00:14:22.242]  Or the lack and have a heard since.
[00:14:22.242 --> 00:14:23.643]  You know what, I'm going to get to this later.
[00:14:23.643 --> 00:14:25.024]  This is so important.
[00:14:25.024 --> 00:14:29.486]  And I'm digressing back to the war news, which I'm going to cover first in detail.
[00:14:29.486 --> 00:14:44.493]  But let me just tell you what's coming up after I get into the incredible Iran and Syria situation and the fact that everything is barreling towards all out war.
[00:14:44.493 --> 00:14:48.335]  I'd say 90% chance it's going to happen the next three or four months.
[00:14:49.431 --> 00:14:53.555]  I mean, Secretary of Defense said last week it looks like it's going to happen.
[00:14:53.555 --> 00:14:57.158]  The Israeli Knesset says it looks like it's going to happen.
[00:14:57.158 --> 00:15:09.309]  Again, the big news outfits are renting space for the next six months on top of the roofs in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem so they can show the missiles coming in.
[00:15:09.309 --> 00:15:12.032]  Doesn't look good when the media starts renting rooftops
[00:15:13.893 --> 00:15:14.893]  Wow!
[00:15:14.893 --> 00:15:17.154]  I hope there's some way to turn this back.
[00:15:17.154 --> 00:15:18.194]  I'm not a fan of the Mullahs.
[00:15:18.194 --> 00:15:20.895]  I'm not a fan of Assad.
[00:15:20.895 --> 00:15:24.256]  But the criminals that run our society are just as bad or worse.
[00:15:24.256 --> 00:15:26.397]  They're more scientific, more sophisticated.
[00:15:26.397 --> 00:15:30.998]  And they're not trying to bring freedom to Iran and Syria.
[00:15:30.998 --> 00:15:35.799]  They are trying to openly bring, well, it's on record they're using Al-Qaeda, Wahhabists.
[00:15:35.799 --> 00:15:41.741]  It's a Saudi Arabian, Wahhabist, allied with the British, Israelis, and the people that run the U.S.
[00:15:43.106 --> 00:15:43.807]  Same old story.
[00:15:43.807 --> 00:15:45.610]  I'm going to get to that in a moment.
[00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:52.540]  But after I cover our top news, I want to get to the next report that is so huge.
[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:56.747]  And it's red-linked at InfoWars.com.
[00:15:56.747 --> 00:15:58.509]  Kurt Nemo put this article together.
[00:15:59.434 --> 00:16:02.496]  With a little help from his friend, Alex Jones.
[00:16:02.496 --> 00:16:05.938]  So it's Kurt Nimmel and Alex Jones.
[00:16:05.938 --> 00:16:07.999]  Think of the Beatles songs.
[00:16:07.999 --> 00:16:10.040]  All a little help from my friends.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:15.663]  Freedom-hating globalists continue attack on the Constitution and liberty.
[00:16:15.663 --> 00:16:18.184]  And that's the headline I gave him.
[00:16:18.184 --> 00:16:23.247]  And I'm tempted to even change it because people think, oh, well, they're just attacking the Constitution by not following it.
[00:16:23.247 --> 00:16:24.488]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:16:24.488 --> 00:16:25.028]  How do I?
[00:16:25.028 --> 00:16:27.890]  Because that's the headline I gave Nimmel when he wrote the article.
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:34.121]  We work together on the own stories, he and I and Paul.
[00:16:34.121 --> 00:16:38.002]  But it's not just they're doing that.
[00:16:38.002 --> 00:16:43.142]  Freedom-hating globalists openly attack the Constitution itself.
[00:16:43.142 --> 00:16:47.463]  Or globalists call for abandoning the Constitution outright.
[00:16:47.463 --> 00:16:51.244]  Or PR campaign calls for abandoning Constitution.
[00:16:51.244 --> 00:16:52.164]  That's it!
[00:16:52.164 --> 00:16:55.265]  PR campaign calls for attacking the Constitution.
[00:16:55.265 --> 00:16:57.285]  See, I can never get words
[00:16:59.204 --> 00:17:05.085]  I can never get words now strong enough for what's actually happening.
[00:17:05.085 --> 00:17:20.469]  Because there aren't really words that can be simple and short to describe the real gristle, the real visceral complexity and stench of the corruption we're facing.
[00:17:27.697 --> 00:17:29.898]  Massive PR campaign.
[00:17:29.898 --> 00:17:31.918]  Concerted PR campaign.
[00:17:31.918 --> 00:17:35.099]  Calls for abolishment of Constitution.
[00:17:35.099 --> 00:17:36.659]  Abandonment of the Constitution.
[00:17:36.659 --> 00:17:39.860]  Because see, somebody's going to read that and think, oh, well, it's just an attack.
[00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:41.060]  Everybody knows it's under attack.
[00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:47.222]  I mean, they're not following a secret arrest, total spying, total control.
[00:17:47.222 --> 00:17:48.682]  But no, no, no, no.
[00:17:48.682 --> 00:17:55.104]  The New York Times, Time Magazine, Newsweek, CNN, BBC,
[00:17:57.759 --> 00:18:09.644]  I saw a Philadelphia paper calling for the end of the Constitution and saying it's trash.
[00:18:09.644 --> 00:18:12.846]  Not only that it's outdated, it's not good enough.
[00:18:12.846 --> 00:18:14.446]  It doesn't give you enough rights.
[00:18:14.446 --> 00:18:15.627]  I mean, talk about...
[00:18:16.917 --> 00:18:20.399]  Coating cyanide with sugar and trying to feed somebody.
[00:18:20.399 --> 00:18:22.941]  I mean, you talk about baloney.
[00:18:22.941 --> 00:18:25.623]  You talk about counting on ignorance.
[00:18:25.623 --> 00:18:27.784]  You talk about deception.
[00:18:27.784 --> 00:18:30.946]  You talk about manipulation.
[00:18:30.946 --> 00:18:39.051]  They are pushing the UN Declaration of Human Rights that in Article 30 says you have none of the rights in the other 29.
[00:18:41.425 --> 00:18:43.026]  I know Kurt quotes it in there.
[00:18:43.026 --> 00:18:47.028]  It's Article 29 and 30 basically then just reverse everything.
[00:18:47.028 --> 00:18:55.472]  I mean it says you've got a right to free health care, you've got a right to a free house, you've got a right to a free car, you've got a right to everything.
[00:18:55.472 --> 00:19:03.616]  But it's going to be a socialist system that delivers it, but for the greater good or if anything contravenes the UN itself, it's null and void.
[00:19:04.784 --> 00:19:08.928]  It openly... I mean, the Soviet Union had the same thing.
[00:19:08.928 --> 00:19:10.610]  You've got every right in the world.
[00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:11.270]  North Korea.
[00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:13.232]  Have you read the North Korean constitution?
[00:19:13.232 --> 00:19:15.995]  It sounds pretty darn good.
[00:19:15.995 --> 00:19:18.877]  Except it's got little provisos.
[00:19:18.877 --> 00:19:21.640]  If it's for national security, we can do whatever we want to you.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.641]  Make you disappear into a black hole.
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:39.306]  The East German, after Hitler fell and the Russians took over half of Germany, it had absolutely no rights at first, and the people demanded more and more and more, and it led out of tyranny to liberty.
[00:19:39.306 --> 00:19:42.188]  But see, we're going the opposite, have this perfect document.
[00:19:42.188 --> 00:19:43.729]  I mean, it's incredible.
[00:19:43.729 --> 00:19:48.171]  It's designed to tie down all these different branches and to protect individual liberty.
[00:19:48.171 --> 00:19:53.634]  Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence, all is built on common law, common sense, Magna Carta,
[00:19:55.105 --> 00:19:58.268]  Uh, you know, the Cromwellian Wars.
[00:19:58.268 --> 00:19:58.788]  All of it!
[00:19:58.788 --> 00:20:00.169]  All the liberties that were fought for.
[00:20:00.169 --> 00:20:03.272]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:03.272 --> 00:20:07.715]  Folks, have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[00:20:07.715 --> 00:20:11.077]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[00:20:11.077 --> 00:20:15.461]  Because there's never been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead.
[00:20:15.461 --> 00:20:16.461]  Here's why.
[00:20:16.461 --> 00:20:22.246]  Solar power generators are now available from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[00:20:22.586 --> 00:20:27.450]  Their emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:33.834]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[00:20:33.834 --> 00:20:37.697]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:20:37.697 --> 00:20:43.641]  Whether it's ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:20:43.641 --> 00:20:48.965]  When the power goes out this winter, you'll be ready with a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.
[00:20:49.246 --> 00:20:52.232]  Go to MySolarBackup.com for more information.

[00:21:13.919 --> 00:21:19.122]  Ever since then, I've dedicated my life to defending people in trouble with the IRS.
[00:21:19.122 --> 00:21:27.728]  I'm a real tax attorney, which means I have two law degrees, a standard law degree known as a JD, and a tax law degree known as a Masters of the Laws in Taxation.

[00:24:22.465 --> 00:24:37.412]  Coming up, globalists are launching a huge PR campaign openly calling for the abolishment of the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:24:37.412 --> 00:24:41.794]  They are openly launching this operation.
[00:24:41.794 --> 00:24:42.755]  I want to go over it.
[00:24:42.755 --> 00:24:44.416]  I mean, it's everywhere.
[00:24:44.416 --> 00:24:45.636]  I talked to Kurt Nimmo this morning.
[00:24:45.636 --> 00:24:46.657]  We were writing the article up.
[00:24:47.841 --> 00:24:50.862]  And he was like, yeah, every time I turn CNN on, I see it.
[00:24:50.862 --> 00:24:52.663]  With that Fareed Zarqawi guy.
[00:24:52.663 --> 00:24:56.064]  And I'm like, yeah, he writes articles saying, get rid of the Constitution.
[00:24:56.064 --> 00:25:01.326]  And this is a foreigner, who's a member of the Bilderberg Group, one of the only journalists.
[00:25:01.326 --> 00:25:03.347]  He's that slimy.
[00:25:03.347 --> 00:25:11.910]  And let me tell you, I was in a CNN green room last year, about to go on the Joy Behar Show, and I was in there for like an hour.
[00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:15.752]  Because they said, oh, this is the show time, we taped the show, but then they just had me sitting there.
[00:25:17.151 --> 00:25:24.862]  And there was Farid sitting there and it was like the Willys.
[00:25:24.862 --> 00:25:31.691]  If I was a central caster for a major film in Hollywood and I was getting a slimy bad guy, he'd be it.
[00:25:32.509 --> 00:25:37.073]  I mean, I've never been in a room with somebody that I was that uncomfortable with.
[00:25:37.073 --> 00:25:42.958]  And I was sitting there asking him questions and recording him, and I ended up, you know, never even putting it on air.
[00:25:42.958 --> 00:25:44.520]  It's on one of my old iPhones around here.
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:52.507]  But the point is, is that he was so slimy, so arrogant, and knew who I was, and was acting like he didn't.
[00:25:53.473 --> 00:25:57.594]  And then I brought up some stuff, and he's like, yes, I know who you are, and I've got to go.
[00:25:57.594 --> 00:26:02.315]  So he basically ran out of the green room and then went and hung out somewhere else because he didn't like talking to me.
[00:26:02.315 --> 00:26:13.837]  But just so slimy to have all... In fact, I was going to have the headline, traitors call for abolishment of Constitution, but they're not traitors.
[00:26:13.837 --> 00:26:15.938]  These are globalists.
[00:26:15.938 --> 00:26:19.258]  These are foreign enemies.
[00:26:19.258 --> 00:26:21.719]  These are people here usurping America.
[00:26:22.554 --> 00:26:28.558]  But they've come in, as the Roman philosopher Cicero said, and attacked from within.
[00:26:28.558 --> 00:26:31.860]  They don't fly their enemy banner openly, they infiltrate.
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.141]  They're infiltrators.
[00:26:33.141 --> 00:26:45.169]  In suits, in ties, they've seized our government, they've taken over our banking system, they're running a global corporate empire on our tax money, and they use fancy PR to convince us that it's our empire.
[00:26:45.169 --> 00:26:47.151]  A lot of good old boys know it's an empire.
[00:26:47.151 --> 00:26:48.372]  They're like, it's ours!
[00:26:48.372 --> 00:26:49.552]  Kill all the brown people!
[00:26:50.453 --> 00:26:52.794]  Well, the globalists hate you as much as they hate brown people.
[00:26:52.794 --> 00:26:55.576]  I mean, they hate everybody, but that's coming up.
[00:26:55.576 --> 00:26:59.238]  Let's get into the war news right now.
[00:26:59.238 --> 00:27:02.360]  Let me just read some of these headlines.
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.502]  Russia's Putin warns against outside interference.
[00:27:05.502 --> 00:27:09.945]  Russia's Prime Minister says West cannot behave like an elephant in a China shop in Syria.
[00:27:11.786 --> 00:27:25.317]  Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday the world faces a growing cult of violence and Moscow must not let events like those in Libya and Syria be repeated in Russia, issuing a warning to the West against interference, which is going on.
[00:27:25.317 --> 00:27:31.462]  And again, Russia's got corrupt leadership, but the globalists are trying to get street wars and stuff going in Russia.
[00:27:31.462 --> 00:27:32.063]  That's on record.
[00:27:33.027 --> 00:27:35.368]  And they put Al-Qaeda in control of Libya.
[00:27:35.368 --> 00:27:40.229]  And now it's admitted they've killed or tortured to death or kidnapped over 40,000 people.
[00:27:40.229 --> 00:27:46.831]  And reporters without borders, doctors without borders, they've all come out and said, we're resigning, we're quitting.
[00:27:46.831 --> 00:27:49.191]  They're lining up black people and shooting them.
[00:27:49.191 --> 00:27:52.472]  They have tortured and murdered the ambassador to France.
[00:27:52.472 --> 00:27:55.113]  They are just killing everybody.
[00:27:55.113 --> 00:27:59.254]  And what the globalists do is, they go in with a proxy army.
[00:28:01.135 --> 00:28:01.435]  I don't know.
[00:28:21.184 --> 00:28:23.826]  Takeover Libya is now flies the Al-Qaeda flag.
[00:28:23.826 --> 00:28:25.568]  I mean, it's real Al-Qaeda.
[00:28:25.568 --> 00:28:26.849]  They're now using on record.
[00:28:26.849 --> 00:28:39.700]  It's in the news that it's Wahhabist attacking from three sides backed up by US special forces on the border giving them weapons and it's now admitted that happened in Libya and it just doesn't even compute on talk radio.
[00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:48.388]  They don't even really talk about this or if it gets brought up, they're like, well, you got to work with bad people sometimes, you know, Al-Qaeda and I'm like, but you want
[00:28:49.434 --> 00:28:52.916]  The TSA to be on the streets and I can't have any rights or liberties.
[00:28:52.916 --> 00:29:06.326]  We've got to launch all these wars because the Al-Qaeda is going to be given Libya and Syria and then Al-Qaeda-like Muslim Brotherhood, British Intel run on record is being given Egypt?
[00:29:06.326 --> 00:29:15.792]  When Egypt had more rights under a Western-backed and controlled dictator, Hosni Mubarak, who they double-crossed their own guy?
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.683]  You gotta ask, why are they putting Wahhabists in everywhere?
[00:29:19.683 --> 00:29:23.088]  Cause they're gonna take over, that's the majority.
[00:29:23.088 --> 00:29:23.889]  Islam religion.
[00:29:25.499 --> 00:29:30.060]  And that's the core Wahhabist group out of Saudi Arabia.
[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:32.101]  And it's the New World Order.
[00:29:32.101 --> 00:29:35.162]  Al Qaeda is the New World Order.
[00:29:35.162 --> 00:29:38.103]  I mean, it's on record hiding in plain view.
[00:29:38.103 --> 00:29:43.544]  And all the Al Qaeda chiefs dining with the Pentagon, hanging out secretly at the Pentagon, trained at U.S.
[00:29:43.544 --> 00:29:44.284]  bases.
[00:29:44.284 --> 00:29:46.905]  I mean, they are the sword of the New World Order.
[00:29:46.905 --> 00:29:49.906]  They work for the bankers.
[00:29:49.906 --> 00:29:51.306]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.306 --> 00:29:52.827]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.837 --> 00:30:00.704]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.704 --> 00:30:02.005]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:02.005 --> 00:30:07.610]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:12.635]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:30:12.635 --> 00:30:17.660]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:23.404]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:30:23.404 --> 00:30:30.529]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:30:30.529 --> 00:30:31.649]  And here's the best part.
[00:30:31.649 --> 00:30:38.014]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:30:38.334 --> 00:30:41.516]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:30:41.516 --> 00:30:43.737]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:30:43.737 --> 00:30:44.678]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:30:44.678 --> 00:30:45.078]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:30:45.078 --> 00:30:48.320]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.081]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:31:01.343 --> 00:31:16.820]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:20.504]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:31:21.502 --> 00:31:34.274]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:31:34.274 --> 00:31:41.541]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:31:42.222 --> 00:31:52.587]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:31:52.587 --> 00:31:56.529]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:31:56.529 --> 00:31:59.631]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[00:32:00.598 --> 00:32:03.519]  I've been telling you about eFoods Direct for a while now.
[00:32:03.519 --> 00:32:07.201]  Here are my top 10 reasons to stock up on food from eFoods Direct.
[00:32:07.201 --> 00:32:07.722]  Number 10.
[00:32:07.722 --> 00:32:10.263]  The food I get from eFoods Direct tastes great.
[00:32:10.263 --> 00:32:11.023]  Number 9.
[00:32:11.023 --> 00:32:12.844]  The eFoods meals are easy to prepare.
[00:32:12.844 --> 00:32:16.766]  8. eFoods Direct delivers the food right to my front door.
[00:32:16.766 --> 00:32:17.086]  7.
[00:32:17.086 --> 00:32:19.027]  Most of these meals cost less than $2.
[00:32:19.027 --> 00:32:20.088]  6.
[00:32:20.088 --> 00:32:22.289]  With their large variety, I can eat it every day. 5.
[00:32:23.329 --> 00:32:26.490]  I always have access to high-quality and delicious food.
[00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:30.472]  Number four, eFoods products don't spoil, so I never waste any food.
[00:32:30.472 --> 00:32:33.874]  Three, eFoods uses only safe, healthy ingredients.
[00:32:33.874 --> 00:32:38.175]  Number two, I have my own food supply and don't depend on the grocery store.
[00:32:38.175 --> 00:32:44.038]  And the number one reason I promote eFoods Direct is they build special offers just for my listeners.
[00:32:44.398 --> 00:32:45.339]  Folks, don't wait.
[00:32:45.339 --> 00:32:46.580]  Get prepared now.
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:48.561]  We all need to be self-sufficient.
[00:32:48.561 --> 00:32:51.123]  Call eFoodsDirect at 800-409-5633 and ask for the Alex Jones Special.
[00:32:51.123 --> 00:32:53.525]  Call eFoodsDirect at 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:33:41.317 --> 00:33:44.622]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:44.622 --> 00:33:46.985]  until 2 p.m.
[00:33:46.985 --> 00:33:48.868]  We are here back Sundays 4 to 6.
[00:33:48.868 --> 00:33:56.339]  Please don't forget that we have the nightly news, a real venture in liberty against the globalists.
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:12.727]  You that are PrisonPlanet.TV members support growing our news gathering and reporting operation with more reporters, graphics people, researchers, writers, filmmakers, and others.
[00:34:12.727 --> 00:34:17.789]  You are funding something with your PrisonPlanet.TV memberships that's having a huge effect.
[00:34:17.789 --> 00:34:23.291]  I'm going to get back into the war news and the attack on the Constitution and tell you about some of the guests that are coming up today.
[00:34:23.291 --> 00:34:24.372]  But before I do that,
[00:34:25.307 --> 00:34:47.800]  And before I expand on the situation in the Middle East, it's really degrading into a serious wider open NATO versus Russia and China proxy war that has nothing to do with democratizing things and everything to do with global consolidation that's leading into a open corporate one world government.
[00:34:49.042 --> 00:34:51.884]  I want to just let you know about a few things that we're doing right now.
[00:34:51.884 --> 00:34:56.929]  A, we are continuing the 15-day free trial at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:34:56.929 --> 00:34:59.871]  Every one of my 20-plus documentary films.
[00:34:59.871 --> 00:35:04.555]  Dozens of other great documentary films that we've been authorized to post up there.
[00:35:04.555 --> 00:35:09.299]  All of my radio shows, all of it going back nine years this April.
[00:35:10.785 --> 00:35:11.506]  It's all there.
[00:35:11.506 --> 00:35:12.927]  My book that's out of print.
[00:35:12.927 --> 00:35:16.409]  Paul Watson's book that's out of print.
[00:35:16.409 --> 00:35:20.553]  Expanded extras from my documentaries that aren't on the DVDs.
[00:35:20.553 --> 00:35:21.994]  Special reports.
[00:35:21.994 --> 00:35:26.918]  The weeknight TV show that more energy goes into than this radio show.
[00:35:27.698 --> 00:35:32.282]  You know, it's just got graphics, documents, clips of information.
[00:35:32.282 --> 00:35:33.442]  Heavily documented.
[00:35:33.442 --> 00:35:35.424]  Every night, seven o'clock, goes out.
[00:35:35.424 --> 00:35:37.485]  Then it's restreamed.
[00:35:37.485 --> 00:35:42.409]  Then it's archived at PrisonPlanet.tv or InfoWarsNews.com.
[00:35:42.409 --> 00:35:43.690]  We'll get you there as well.
[00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:48.013]  And we're continuing that special we always do in December, January.
[00:35:48.013 --> 00:35:51.936]  We're just going to continue it for a while because I want people to join up.
[00:35:51.936 --> 00:35:53.197]  It's Give the Gift of Truth.
[00:35:54.116 --> 00:35:58.580]  And it is 40 plus percent off right now on a yearly membership.
[00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:00.581]  We're going to continue that through February.
[00:36:00.581 --> 00:36:02.463]  And then the special is going to be gone.
[00:36:02.463 --> 00:36:03.964]  It was extremely popular.
[00:36:03.964 --> 00:36:05.065]  So we're continuing that.
[00:36:05.065 --> 00:36:07.086]  It's now the Friendship Special.
[00:36:07.086 --> 00:36:08.607]  Give the gift of truth.
[00:36:08.607 --> 00:36:10.889]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:36:10.889 --> 00:36:12.631]  Also, you can probably notice
[00:36:13.755 --> 00:36:16.096]  That I've lost 37 pounds in about a week or so.
[00:36:16.096 --> 00:36:20.518]  I haven't lost any more weight because I've been so busy working on this new film and some other stuff.
[00:36:20.518 --> 00:36:26.220]  I haven't been as exercising as much, but I've certainly taken the tangy tangerine and everything else.
[00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:27.061]  I don't eat as much.
[00:36:27.061 --> 00:36:28.141]  I'm not as hungry.
[00:36:28.141 --> 00:36:29.042]  I have a lot more energy.
[00:36:29.042 --> 00:36:29.982]  I feel a lot better.
[00:36:29.982 --> 00:36:35.885]  You can see it right here on camera, or if you're a radio listener, you can go to Infowars.com and watch the daily videos.
[00:36:35.885 --> 00:36:36.705]  You can see it right there.
[00:36:37.165 --> 00:36:38.727]  I've lost 37 pounds.
[00:36:38.727 --> 00:36:47.616]  Aaron Dykes has lost over 65 pounds in the last seven, eight months just taking vitamin and mineral powders that are properly formulated.
[00:36:47.616 --> 00:36:52.361]  The media and government's always saying, oh, you only need 60-something minerals and vitamins.
[00:36:53.715 --> 00:37:04.202]  You really need 90 plus, and that's what the Beyond Tangy Tangerine has, that's what the Pollen Burst has, that's what the Rebound has, those are my favorite products.
[00:37:04.202 --> 00:37:06.243]  They're not even advertised as weight loss.
[00:37:06.243 --> 00:37:08.605]  Your body needs minerals and vitamins.
[00:37:08.605 --> 00:37:15.989]  You're starving, that's why you eat so many empty calories, trying to get the vitamins and minerals and cofactors and trace elements.
[00:37:15.989 --> 00:37:21.073]  It's in the Tangy Tangerine, it's in the Pollen Burst, it's in the Rebound, it's in the Alex Pack.
[00:37:22.059 --> 00:37:28.786]  There are some weight loss systems, the Slender FX weight management system with the weight powder and the rest of it.
[00:37:28.786 --> 00:37:29.327]  It's all there.
[00:37:30.433 --> 00:37:33.496]  You can get it all again at Infowarsteam.com.
[00:37:33.496 --> 00:37:37.239]  Very, very excited about what's happening there at Infowarsteam.com.
[00:37:37.239 --> 00:37:41.543]  You can sign up for $10 and become a distributor and get discounts or just buy it right off the site.
[00:37:41.543 --> 00:37:46.628]  But I'm challenging you to try it and I think you're going to enjoy it.
[00:37:46.628 --> 00:37:48.229]  I mean, I certainly know it's worked for me.
[00:37:48.229 --> 00:37:49.491]  I know it's worked for Aaron.
[00:37:49.491 --> 00:37:50.772]  The proof is in the pudding.
[00:37:50.772 --> 00:37:54.976]  And notice it's the only weight loss system where they're not advertising in his weight loss.
[00:37:56.348 --> 00:38:02.869]  Listening to Ben Fuchs over a year ago, and listening to others explain, look, weight loss is secondary.
[00:38:02.869 --> 00:38:06.990]  You start getting the vitamins and minerals you need, you're not going to be as hungry.
[00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:16.653]  And unless you're just a glutton who just eats to eat and eat and eat and eat, and most of us eat when we're hungry, you eat a dinner and an hour later you're hungry, you didn't get what you needed.
[00:38:16.653 --> 00:38:22.714]  So instead of just going and drinking a Coca-Cola, or even a glass of milk, which is better for you than Coca-Cola but somewhat empty,
[00:38:24.068 --> 00:38:25.810]  Or is it eating a bag of chips?
[00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:29.454]  Bang back a scoop of tangy tangerine.
[00:38:29.454 --> 00:38:32.096]  It tastes like fruit punch.
[00:38:32.096 --> 00:38:35.840]  It doesn't taste like corn syrup fruit punch where it's all sweet and everything.
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.802]  It tastes better than that.
[00:38:37.802 --> 00:38:40.385]  It tastes like vitamins and minerals.
[00:38:42.782 --> 00:38:45.863]  Sometimes if I want to drink a glass of wine or something, I'll just have some.
[00:38:45.863 --> 00:38:48.424]  Because it's like more fulfilling.
[00:38:48.424 --> 00:38:52.566]  Your body can taste the vitamins and minerals.
[00:38:52.566 --> 00:38:53.766]  It knows that it wants it.
[00:38:53.766 --> 00:38:59.128]  It's like cows and deer that go and find natural salt licks and lick it, wanting the vitamins and wanting the minerals.
[00:38:59.128 --> 00:39:00.549]  Well, the minerals out of the salt lick.
[00:39:01.169 --> 00:39:02.170]  I mean, it's that simple.
[00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:03.511]  You need this.
[00:39:03.511 --> 00:39:04.612]  You need the iodine.
[00:39:04.612 --> 00:39:05.633]  You need it all.
[00:39:05.633 --> 00:39:09.055]  And it's a one-stop shop with the Beyond Dainty Tangerine.
[00:39:09.055 --> 00:39:10.577]  Now, there's a lot of other products.
[00:39:10.577 --> 00:39:14.900]  They've got, you know, the best kelp and seaweed-based systems for your thyroid.
[00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:16.561]  And I'm starting to take that.
[00:39:16.561 --> 00:39:19.124]  I've just never been somebody who takes pills and takes powders.
[00:39:19.924 --> 00:39:20.024]  And
[00:39:34.701 --> 00:39:36.842]  Digressing, I'm digressing.
[00:39:36.842 --> 00:39:38.622]  Infowarsteam.com.
[00:39:38.622 --> 00:39:44.764]  And if you want to order via the phone or ask any questions, you can also go to the site and there's a phone number there on it.
[00:39:44.764 --> 00:39:45.044]  877-551-1301.
[00:39:45.044 --> 00:39:46.425]  877-551-1301 if you have any questions or comments.
[00:39:46.425 --> 00:39:46.485]  877-551-1301.
[00:39:46.485 --> 00:39:47.265]  Infowarsteam.com.
[00:39:47.265 --> 00:39:48.505]  And yes, it is selling out quick.
[00:39:48.505 --> 00:39:49.526]  We may have to go to a reprint.
[00:39:49.526 --> 00:39:50.546]  Again, I'm not the publisher, but I've...
[00:40:03.314 --> 00:40:07.375]  Spotted him the money to print up a bunch of them.
[00:40:07.375 --> 00:40:15.378]  Because I'm somebody who sells them on the online bookstore, Infowars.com, and I couldn't get enough of these to fulfill orders I had.
[00:40:15.378 --> 00:40:21.200]  Because it was this on-demand place that it was just taking forever.
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:25.801]  And I kept promising listeners, because, oh, you'll get them in a week, you'll get them in a week, and a month went by.
[00:40:25.801 --> 00:40:28.402]  And I called them up, I had Weldon call them up, and I said, look,
[00:40:31.379 --> 00:40:34.362]  We know big printers, the biggest in the country.
[00:40:34.362 --> 00:40:36.644]  We can get these printed in a week or two.
[00:40:36.644 --> 00:40:39.426]  We need to fill these orders or we're going to have to refund people's money.
[00:40:39.426 --> 00:40:40.987]  I don't make people wait a month to get stuff.
[00:40:40.987 --> 00:40:45.050]  We've gotten good where most stuff ships out within 24, 48 hours.
[00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:48.072]  Our customer service is just, look at our Amazon rating off the chart.
[00:40:50.359 --> 00:41:00.943]  Our rating on eBay, just as good as it gets, the best rating, because we've, under Weldon Henson and Tim Fruge back there, they just kick Hind in at customer service compared to what we used to be.
[00:41:00.943 --> 00:41:03.204]  It was okay, but not very good.
[00:41:03.204 --> 00:41:05.605]  But the last few years, they've really got us going well.
[00:41:05.605 --> 00:41:08.426]  But I was saying, that's it, we've got to return hundreds of orders.
[00:41:08.426 --> 00:41:09.487]  It just never comes.
[00:41:09.487 --> 00:41:10.607]  They keep saying it's going to come.
[00:41:10.607 --> 00:41:11.988]  So we printed up a bunch.
[00:41:11.988 --> 00:41:13.849]  Those are almost sold out.
[00:41:13.849 --> 00:41:15.449]  It'll take two or three, four weeks maybe.
[00:41:15.449 --> 00:41:18.311]  You've got to put it in, proof it, and then get it to
[00:41:19.761 --> 00:41:27.463]  By the way, Bloodlines Illuminati is selling on average for 200 bucks everywhere, because it's essentially out of print until we did this.
[00:41:27.463 --> 00:41:29.644]  Well, we're selling it obviously for a fraction of that.
[00:41:29.644 --> 00:41:32.865]  It is the size of the Dallas phone book.
[00:41:32.865 --> 00:41:35.386]  It does cost a lot to get printed, but it's $49.95.
[00:41:35.386 --> 00:41:44.229]  There's also signed copies by Fritz Springmeier and signed copies available from yours truly, or both our signatures, as folks requested them, at InfoWars.com.
[00:41:46.005 --> 00:41:49.988]  And Fritz and I have said that's it for signed copies this year.
[00:41:49.988 --> 00:41:51.450]  200 were signed.
[00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:53.712]  Some by him, some by me, some by both.
[00:41:53.712 --> 00:41:56.314]  When those are gone, that's it.
[00:41:56.314 --> 00:41:59.076]  200, that's it.
[00:41:59.076 --> 00:41:59.316]  In 2012.
[00:41:59.316 --> 00:42:00.197]  200, that's it.
[00:42:00.197 --> 00:42:02.579]  So they're available at Infowars.com.
[00:42:02.579 --> 00:42:03.540]  Okay, that's enough.
[00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:06.922]  I just tend to never plug stuff, and that's how we fund our operation as well.
[00:42:06.922 --> 00:42:12.087]  I mean, I'll go days now without even plugging things, and people are always pointing out, hey, you got 34 crew members.
[00:42:12.087 --> 00:42:14.068]  Alex, you're hiring three or four more people.
[00:42:15.491 --> 00:42:18.812]  We're going to not be able to fund things if you don't plug stuff.
[00:42:18.812 --> 00:42:33.037]  But it's a win-win-win-win-win because these are all great materials to help wake folks up, whether it's Noble Lie, Proving Oklahoma City's an Inside Job, whether it's all the other new books and videos we're carrying.
[00:42:33.037 --> 00:42:36.038]  It's all about getting the word out and educating yourself to a higher level.
[00:42:36.038 --> 00:42:40.399]  Okay, before I get into this war news and then the Constitution attack news,
[00:42:41.747 --> 00:42:50.435]  This is a quote from a war diary, The Seven Arts, published near the end of a war that killed tens of millions.
[00:42:50.435 --> 00:42:57.502]  Of course, that was World War I, that then gave rise to World War II, and gave rise to fascism.
[00:43:01.434 --> 00:43:02.595]  And communism.
[00:43:02.595 --> 00:43:04.777]  War creates poverty.
[00:43:04.777 --> 00:43:08.199]  War creates massive, big, corrupt, secret police units.
[00:43:08.199 --> 00:43:13.983]  War creates, in every case, long term if you keep having it, horrible, degradated societies.
[00:43:13.983 --> 00:43:16.345]  And that's why tyrants love them.
[00:43:16.345 --> 00:43:18.127]  It's taught in Chicago Business School.
[00:43:18.127 --> 00:43:19.568]  It's taught at Harvard.
[00:43:19.568 --> 00:43:20.969]  It's mainline history.
[00:43:20.969 --> 00:43:23.951]  I mean, the Romans knew this.
[00:43:23.951 --> 00:43:26.173]  Julius Caesar used wars to become dictator.
[00:43:26.889 --> 00:43:31.031]  Third world countries always use a war with a neighbor as an excuse to seize power.
[00:43:31.031 --> 00:43:33.152]  It's bad news.
[00:43:33.152 --> 00:43:41.096]  Offensive wars are always cancer to a country, to a society, to a republic.
[00:43:41.096 --> 00:43:45.498]  It is that simple.
[00:43:45.498 --> 00:43:48.900]  Guys, will you make sure that headline gets changed on that?
[00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:50.241]  No, it's been changed.
[00:43:50.241 --> 00:43:53.562]  Globalist campaign calls for abolishment of Constitution.
[00:43:53.562 --> 00:43:54.563]  Good.
[00:43:54.563 --> 00:43:54.863]  Excellent.
[00:43:56.195 --> 00:44:00.399]  That's our top story right now, you know, of our specific reports today.
[00:44:00.399 --> 00:44:02.861]  It's so important to get that out to people.
[00:44:02.861 --> 00:44:05.023]  And you never know what listeners pick up and make viral.
[00:44:05.023 --> 00:44:12.330]  Sometimes it's the most, you know, moderately important piece of news compared to just some bombshell.
[00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:19.557]  And if I yell and squeal and make noises and beg folks to get it out, because I just want to beat these people, it won't get the attention.
[00:44:20.424 --> 00:44:21.407]  But it's up to you folks.
[00:44:21.407 --> 00:44:26.962]  I mean, this is outrageous, this article, where they're openly running around like chickens with their heads cut off everywhere.
[00:44:27.768 --> 00:44:40.733]  Like a tree full of 5,000 macaw parrots chirping, get rid of the Constitution, get rid of it, get rid of it, it's evil, it's bad, it's naughty, it's old, it's stinky, it's not good, it's abusive, they were racist, on and on and on.
[00:44:40.733 --> 00:44:52.117]  Big mega-global corporations, Bilderberg, Farner, globalists like Fareed Zarqawa, or whatever that idiot's name is, it's just a disgusting article, and it is treason.
[00:44:52.117 --> 00:44:53.198]  Anybody who's a U.S.
[00:44:53.198 --> 00:44:56.879]  citizen, you got all the free speech you could ever want in the world.
[00:44:58.308 --> 00:45:11.073]  As long as you don't call for violence against a specific person, as long as you don't call for crimes to be committed, and then that's just criminal.
[00:45:11.073 --> 00:45:23.738]  But there's one thing, you can read this in federal state court rulings going back over 230 years, when you call for overthrowing our Republican form of government, and our Declaration of Independence, and our Constitution, and our Bill of Rights,
[00:45:25.214 --> 00:45:33.339]  Under the financing of a foreign power, be it corporate or be it the UN, and that's who all these guys do it for, the UN calls for it.
[00:45:33.339 --> 00:45:42.024]  When the UN does it, it is infiltration, it is an attempt at warfare and overthrow.
[00:45:42.024 --> 00:45:43.986]  It's an act of war.
[00:45:43.986 --> 00:45:52.311]  But when a US citizen, this is a very specific definition, serves a foreign power,
[00:45:54.204 --> 00:45:58.966]  And calls for the overthrow of our form of government that is America.
[00:45:58.966 --> 00:46:00.426]  That's what makes it America.
[00:46:00.426 --> 00:46:01.787]  That's America being attacked.
[00:46:01.787 --> 00:46:02.987]  That's what made us special.
[00:46:02.987 --> 00:46:05.048]  The example of liberty worldwide.
[00:46:05.048 --> 00:46:09.750]  When you call for its abolishment, it is treason.
[00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:11.291]  And I don't just use that word.
[00:46:11.291 --> 00:46:15.492]  It is treason.
[00:46:15.492 --> 00:46:17.113]  Period.
[00:46:17.113 --> 00:46:22.615]  And when government sworn people who have sworn to that constitution,
[00:46:23.595 --> 00:46:30.959]  When they openly call for it and say, I don't have to follow the Constitution like Bush did, or Obama saying, I don't follow the Constitution, I'm watching a war under U.N.
[00:46:30.959 --> 00:46:33.300]  authority for its credibility.
[00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:37.382]  That is THE definition.
[00:46:37.382 --> 00:46:52.451]  The real McCoy, the bonafide, like a Mona Lisa is a Mona Lisa, or a Rembrandt, is a bonafide masterpiece, as good as it gets, most valuable art, is a bonafide masterpiece.
[00:46:53.496 --> 00:46:57.277]  Vincent van Gogh, bona fide masterpiece, every one of them.
[00:46:57.277 --> 00:47:08.720]  When the people in government, who are American citizens, call for overthrowing our system and then start doing it, it is high treason.
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:11.541]  High treason.
[00:47:11.541 --> 00:47:12.221]  High treason.
[00:47:15.779 --> 00:47:17.080]  Not treason.
[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:18.020]  High treason.
[00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:21.242]  And high treason is not being done in the dark.
[00:47:21.242 --> 00:47:26.564]  They think you're so dumb, they're running up and down the street in front of everyone.
[00:47:26.564 --> 00:47:29.105]  They're running up and down the block in front of everyone.
[00:47:29.105 --> 00:47:30.566]  I mean, I've got, there's a bunch of examples here.
[00:47:30.566 --> 00:47:32.387]  I get so angry.
[00:47:32.387 --> 00:47:36.609]  Rob Jacobson called me last night and said, have you seen this New York Times article?
[00:47:36.609 --> 00:47:44.333]  And so all of a sudden, Ruth Bader Ginsburg told the Egyptians, former Supreme Court minion, you know, don't use our Constitution, it's not good.
[00:47:45.623 --> 00:47:48.524]  Of course, you've said four of the current ones have said that.
[00:47:48.524 --> 00:47:50.905]  You'll follow you in law.
[00:47:50.905 --> 00:47:52.205]  He said, have you seen this New York Times?
[00:47:52.205 --> 00:47:52.725]  I said, no.
[00:47:52.725 --> 00:47:53.885]  He said, well, it's on Drudge.
[00:47:53.885 --> 00:47:55.826]  I go, oh, I missed that.
[00:47:55.826 --> 00:47:58.987]  And they just say, get rid of the Constitution.
[00:47:58.987 --> 00:48:00.047]  Listen to this headline.
[00:48:00.047 --> 00:48:02.828]  We the people loses appeal with people around the world.
[00:48:02.828 --> 00:48:04.649]  They act like it's a populist movement against it.
[00:48:04.649 --> 00:48:09.370]  And it's a twisted, sophistic, you know, piece of garbage.
[00:48:10.254 --> 00:48:10.954]  And you know what I'm gonna do?
[00:48:10.954 --> 00:48:15.315]  I got Mark Moreno with incredible victories against the Globalists coming up and I gotta hit the war news.
[00:48:15.315 --> 00:48:18.356]  So I'll hit the war news in the next segment.
[00:48:18.356 --> 00:48:29.558]  And then when Moreno leaves us at bottom of the next hour, we'll just get Mark on right at the start.
[00:48:29.558 --> 00:48:31.299]  I'm gonna get into this.
[00:48:31.299 --> 00:48:36.180]  And then we do today have the father coming on who is a lawyer.
[00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:49.039]  And he says they've indicted and charged us, charged and indicted us for our child being late to class, but I went and read the code and it doesn't say that was even a truancy.
[00:48:49.039 --> 00:48:50.881]  He goes, I don't understand how, I've never seen this.
[00:48:50.881 --> 00:48:54.083]  I'm like, oh, welcome to the club, pal.
[00:48:54.083 --> 00:48:55.184]  This is what they do everywhere now.
[00:48:55.184 --> 00:48:56.825]  They don't care what the law says.
[00:48:56.825 --> 00:48:59.207]  Besides, you're in family court.
[00:48:59.207 --> 00:49:03.210]  It was set up as a eugenics court.
[00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:03.891]  1910, New York first.
[00:49:05.254 --> 00:49:08.815]  35 states sterilized, killed people, did whatever they wanted.
[00:49:08.815 --> 00:49:09.915]  Oh yeah, they'd stick babies.
[00:49:09.915 --> 00:49:11.795]  I have the newsreels at Endgame.
[00:49:11.795 --> 00:49:17.116]  They would hold a baby's nose and mouth if they were deformed and kill them right there at the hospital.
[00:49:17.116 --> 00:49:21.157]  And hold the mothers down if they didn't like it.
[00:49:21.157 --> 00:49:23.698]  Oh, your child's got a club foot?
[00:49:23.698 --> 00:49:24.218]  Bye-bye!
[00:49:24.218 --> 00:49:27.038]  Your child's got a cleft lip?
[00:49:27.038 --> 00:49:27.558]  Bye-bye!
[00:49:27.558 --> 00:49:29.719]  Your child's blind?
[00:49:29.719 --> 00:49:30.159]  Bye-bye!
[00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:34.630]  Look here, let's just put a hand over the mouth and hold that nose.
[00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:38.351]  This will just take four minutes.
[00:49:38.351 --> 00:49:39.812]  And you didn't have a choice.
[00:49:39.812 --> 00:49:44.993]  I have the newsreels and the promotions where it shows that he brings the woman in and he goes, she's fine, your honor.
[00:49:44.993 --> 00:49:45.654]  She's intelligent.
[00:49:45.654 --> 00:49:46.934]  She's got a good job.
[00:49:46.934 --> 00:49:49.195]  But her brother is a cripple.
[00:49:49.195 --> 00:49:51.956]  And the other brother has a criminal record.
[00:49:51.956 --> 00:49:54.797]  Obviously mentally from bad stock.
[00:49:54.797 --> 00:49:55.837]  Sterilization!
[00:49:57.236 --> 00:49:58.437]  I mean, this is what went on.
[00:49:58.437 --> 00:50:07.641]  So lawyers send me emails and they say, sir, before I come on, I'd like you to acknowledge I've been attacked on other shows, that there's not even a law.
[00:50:07.641 --> 00:50:09.061]  I don't know how I've been indicted.
[00:50:09.061 --> 00:50:09.622]  Here's the code.
[00:50:09.622 --> 00:50:10.242]  And I have the code.
[00:50:10.242 --> 00:50:12.083]  He said, I know, I know.
[00:50:12.083 --> 00:50:17.445]  I mean, people are now arrested for handing my videos out in Kentucky.
[00:50:17.445 --> 00:50:22.868]  People are arrested for handing out C-SPAN videos of Ron Paul because the police don't like it.
[00:50:22.868 --> 00:50:25.149]  That was in Kentucky, Lyon County.
[00:50:26.184 --> 00:50:36.371]  In the newspaper, they indicted Kelly Rushing, and I've seen other cases, because the cops didn't like, thought it was anti-government.
[00:50:36.371 --> 00:50:48.899]  And it went to trial, and the jury said First Amendment, let him go, but the judge was so whacked out and evil, the state police were so whacked out and nuts, I mean, these are ravenous wolves coming for us.
[00:50:48.899 --> 00:50:55.744]  Not everywhere, but this is what they're, that's why they've got to openly say get rid of the Constitution in front of everybody, because they've basically already gotten rid of it.
[00:50:56.724 --> 00:51:01.147]  And they're criminals and they know it indicts them!
[00:51:01.147 --> 00:51:04.069]  I've been telling you about eFoods Direct for a while now.
[00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:07.751]  Here are my top 10 reasons to stock up on food from eFoods Direct.
[00:51:07.751 --> 00:51:08.271]  Number 10.
[00:51:08.271 --> 00:51:10.813]  The food I get from eFoods Direct tastes great.
[00:51:10.813 --> 00:51:11.573]  Number 9.
[00:51:11.573 --> 00:51:13.395]  The eFoods meals are easy to prepare.
[00:51:13.395 --> 00:51:17.317]  8. eFoods Direct delivers the food right to my front door.
[00:51:17.317 --> 00:51:17.637]  7.
[00:51:17.637 --> 00:51:19.578]  Most of these meals cost less than $2.
[00:51:19.578 --> 00:51:20.639]  6.
[00:51:20.639 --> 00:51:22.821]  With their large variety, I can eat it every day. 5.
[00:51:23.881 --> 00:51:27.045]  I always have access to high-quality and delicious food.
[00:51:27.045 --> 00:51:31.029]  Number four, eFoods products don't spoil, so I never waste any food.
[00:51:31.029 --> 00:51:34.433]  Three, eFoods uses only safe, healthy ingredients.
[00:51:34.433 --> 00:51:38.737]  Number two, I have my own food supply and don't depend on the grocery store.
[00:51:38.737 --> 00:51:44.604]  And the number one reason I promote eFoods Direct is they build special offers just for my listeners.
[00:51:44.944 --> 00:51:45.905]  Folks, don't wait.
[00:51:45.905 --> 00:51:47.125]  Get prepared now.
[00:51:47.125 --> 00:51:49.106]  We all need to be self-sufficient.

[00:52:00.779 --> 00:52:04.980]  Do you use a CPAP breathing device to help treat sleep apnea and prevent snoring?
[00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:10.801]  If so, you should know big insurance companies and government regulations can affect the way you buy sleep apnea equipment.
[00:52:10.801 --> 00:52:15.682]  They decide what devices you receive, when you get replacement equipment, and even what you pay.
[00:52:15.682 --> 00:52:17.662]  Why limit the quality of your treatment?
[00:52:17.662 --> 00:52:22.623]  Break away from institutionalized health care and shop where you set the sleep therapy standard.
[00:52:22.623 --> 00:52:24.583]  Shop at CPAP.com.
[00:52:24.583 --> 00:52:25.263]  See what?
[00:52:25.263 --> 00:52:25.904]  CPAP.
[00:52:25.904 --> 00:52:28.304]  It stands for Continuous Positive Airway Pressure.
[00:52:28.544 --> 00:52:32.787]  CPAP.com has the equipment you want in stock and ready to ship today.

[00:53:56.723 --> 00:53:58.545]  Working to keep the world tied together.
[00:54:01.644 --> 00:54:07.447]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:07.447 --> 00:54:09.588]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:28.379 --> 00:54:29.900]  Think about it.
[00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:36.984]  The foreign corporations that have bought and sold all our politicians openly are setting up a corporate world government.
[00:54:36.984 --> 00:54:43.448]  They're openly saying they'll attack, murder, kill any citizens whenever they want, spy on anybody.
[00:54:43.448 --> 00:54:46.010]  Cities pass laws saying take Florida out of the water.
[00:54:46.010 --> 00:54:49.412]  The Feds come in and finance the state to pass laws.
[00:54:49.412 --> 00:54:55.275]  The UN's involved at local city levels getting carbon taxes put in place because they can't get the Congress to do it.
[00:54:55.275 --> 00:54:57.917]  There's just treason and treachery going on everywhere.
[00:54:59.292 --> 00:55:02.015]  But here's that quote, war is the health of the state.
[00:55:02.015 --> 00:55:19.331]  It automatically sets in motion throughout society those irresistible forces for uniformity, for passionate cooperation with the government in coercing into obedience the minority groups and individuals which lack the larger heard sense, those that are awake.
[00:55:19.932 --> 00:55:34.357]  The notion in wartime attains a uniformity of feeling, a hierarchy of values, culminating at the undisputed apex of the state ideal, which could not possibly be produced through any other agency than war.
[00:55:34.357 --> 00:55:42.859]  The state is intimately connected with war, for it is the organization of the collective community when it acts in a political manner.
[00:55:42.859 --> 00:55:48.101]  And to act in a political manner towards a rival group has meant, throughout all of history, war.
[00:55:49.451 --> 00:55:55.194]  The war on illiteracy is a war on state and local rights, and the kids have been dumbed down by design.
[00:55:55.194 --> 00:55:58.756]  The war on drugs is a war on the general public.
[00:55:58.756 --> 00:56:06.300]  They ship them in, you pick them up, now it's an excuse to put you in their private prison.
[00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:11.343]  It's like laying black pebbles all over the ground and saying if you pick a black pebble up, you go to jail.
[00:56:11.343 --> 00:56:14.865]  They drop the black pebbles, people pick up a black pebble, oops, saw you pick it up.
[00:56:16.778 --> 00:56:17.899]  A war on terror.
[00:56:17.899 --> 00:56:19.140]  Who's running the terrorists?
[00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:20.261]  The globalists.
[00:56:20.261 --> 00:56:21.922]  And they take everybody's rights.
[00:56:21.922 --> 00:56:25.745]  It's full spectrum dominance.
[00:56:25.745 --> 00:56:29.569]  And that's why the Iranian government, they're unpopular, they're on the verge of being overthrown.
[00:56:29.569 --> 00:56:35.554]  Every expert that's looked at it says it's going to make them incredibly popular when they get into a war with the West.
[00:56:35.554 --> 00:56:38.596]  So they're starting to go, okay, we'll have a war.
[00:56:38.596 --> 00:56:41.419]  Israel, their government's going to get incredibly popular.
[00:56:41.419 --> 00:56:42.680]  They'll be able to reduce more rights.
[00:56:43.988 --> 00:56:46.250]  What have the environmentalists said, who aren't really environmentalists?
[00:56:46.250 --> 00:57:02.362]  They've said, we'll take your rights, and we'll say it's a war against global warming, a war against extinction of things, and we'll have ration cards, and they're now saying, and a carbon ration footprint, and a calorie footprint, and we'll call it a war.
[00:57:02.362 --> 00:57:03.222]  A war.
[00:57:03.222 --> 00:57:03.723]  A war.
[00:57:03.723 --> 00:57:05.784]  In a war, we suspend your rights.
[00:57:05.784 --> 00:57:06.424]  In a war.
[00:57:07.566 --> 00:57:08.287]  And it is a war.
[00:57:08.287 --> 00:57:11.089]  It's a globalist war against everything that's independent.
[00:57:11.089 --> 00:57:15.512]  It's a corporate takeover of nations, of families, of individuals.
[00:57:15.512 --> 00:57:20.456]  It's all about making people dependent on the system.
[00:57:20.456 --> 00:57:21.977]  It's so elementary.
[00:57:21.977 --> 00:57:24.159]  And now they're reporting, U.S.
[00:57:24.159 --> 00:57:25.100]  and NATO forces
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:26.521]  On.
[00:57:26.521 --> 00:57:27.242]  The.
[00:57:27.242 --> 00:57:28.283]  Ground.
[00:57:28.283 --> 00:57:29.944]  In different areas of Syria.
[00:57:29.944 --> 00:57:32.247]  There are now street battles all over the country.
[00:57:32.247 --> 00:57:36.611]  Again, it's an open Western proxy war to bring down that country.
[00:57:36.611 --> 00:57:38.933]  But not to bring in freedom.
[00:57:38.933 --> 00:57:41.656]  They're going to put the jihadis in.
[00:57:41.656 --> 00:57:44.979]  They're openly going to put islamicists in.
[00:57:44.979 --> 00:57:47.442]  But I thought, we've got to give our rights up because of the islamicists.
[00:57:49.867 --> 00:57:52.589]  And of course, 10 years from now, they'll have another war with those Islamicists.
[00:57:52.589 --> 00:58:03.538]  I mean, it's just amazing how the globalists operate, how they build up these enemies, how they build up Saddam, how they build up Bin Laden, how they build it all up and then knock it down.
[00:58:03.538 --> 00:58:09.002]  Because they need to keep these wars going, the no-bid contracts, the power grabs, all of it.
[00:58:09.002 --> 00:58:18.750]  But now Russia is saying they are going to put spitsnats in, and I've got reports on InfoWars.com, mainstream news, that the spitsnats have now been put in.
[00:58:20.063 --> 00:58:22.283]  And the Russians are shipping weapons in.
[00:58:22.283 --> 00:58:25.164]  That's why the globalists are trying to have street battles.
[00:58:25.164 --> 00:58:27.665]  They don't want to have, they want to have a guerrilla war.
[00:58:27.665 --> 00:58:32.166]  And now special forces are there, just like there was western special forces there before.
[00:58:32.166 --> 00:58:43.308]  I mean, our country is run by foreign banks that have us in a war, and they're trying to start a big war with Iran!
[00:58:43.308 --> 00:58:47.269]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.227 --> 00:58:52.288]  I had tried everything.
[00:58:52.288 --> 00:58:54.650]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[00:58:54.650 --> 00:58:57.772]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[00:58:57.772 --> 00:59:02.616]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[00:59:02.616 --> 00:59:09.481]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[00:59:09.481 --> 00:59:19.929]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:59:20.669 --> 00:59:25.151]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[00:59:25.151 --> 00:59:31.413]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:59:31.413 --> 00:59:32.974]  Now that's results.
[00:59:32.974 --> 00:59:39.756]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfoWarsTeam.com and to order just three of their products.
[00:59:39.756 --> 00:59:45.478]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.
[00:59:45.478 --> 00:59:48.039]  Start your journey to health and wellness today.
[00:59:48.039 --> 00:59:49.640]  InfoWarsTeam.com
[00:59:53.621 --> 00:59:56.022]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.022 --> 01:00:05.466]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.466 --> 01:00:06.767]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.767 --> 01:00:08.547]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.547 --> 01:00:10.308]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.308 --> 01:00:11.889]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.889 --> 01:00:13.429]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.429 --> 01:00:17.631]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.631 --> 01:00:21.673]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.195 --> 01:00:37.059]  I am begging you to get our article, Globalist Campaign Calls for Abolishment of Constitution, and get it out to everybody, because it's so outrageous what these slime bags are doing.
[01:00:37.059 --> 01:00:38.059]  It's so disgusting.
[01:00:38.059 --> 01:00:39.980]  After Mark Moreno leaves us at the bottom of the hour,
[01:00:41.159 --> 01:00:42.920]  I'm going to get into this report.
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:51.803]  I'm going to read the report on air and be as calm as I can and as eloquent as I can, but we need a new Declaration of Independence against these hijackers.
[01:00:51.803 --> 01:01:02.707]  These globalist criminals that have taken over our country and the world and are engaged in every manner of crime in our name.
[01:01:02.707 --> 01:01:07.189]  We are in grave danger as a republic.
[01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:10.521]  Our society is in so much trouble.
[01:01:10.521 --> 01:01:13.623]  Coming up, I'll give you the latest on the campaign.
[01:01:13.623 --> 01:01:17.125]  Iran to deploy 15,000 troops to help Syria's Assad.
[01:01:17.125 --> 01:01:21.047]  That's Herat reporting that.
[01:01:21.047 --> 01:01:28.952]  We've got a lot of other news that we are going to be breaking down here on the broadcast today.
[01:01:32.136 --> 01:01:35.278]  But these are the times that big world wars start.
[01:01:35.278 --> 01:01:40.301]  These are the times that revolutions take place, because we're going into a global depression.
[01:01:40.301 --> 01:01:43.664]  And we're going to break here in a few minutes, so we'll just recap whatever he says now.
[01:01:47.086 --> 01:01:54.672]  Is of course one of the leading people exposing the environmental movement as a fraud, not caring about the environment but power grabbing.
[01:01:54.672 --> 01:01:56.814]  And he heads up ClimateDepot.com.
[01:01:56.814 --> 01:02:02.518]  He's also worked as the director of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and was a senior aide to Senator James Inhofe.
[01:02:02.518 --> 01:02:08.423]  So he's been out there for over a decade exposing these people and it's got to feel good now.
[01:02:08.423 --> 01:02:12.006]  And I'll ask him this question when we come back from break because I want the full audience to hear it.
[01:02:12.006 --> 01:02:13.527]  Some stations don't carry this segment.
[01:02:13.527 --> 01:02:14.228]  XM and others do.
[01:02:15.737 --> 01:02:17.278]  That we're being vindicated.
[01:02:17.278 --> 01:02:24.382]  I mean, if we thought Climategate was damaging, there's explosions every day bigger than that.
[01:02:24.382 --> 01:02:27.524]  I mean, it is a route.
[01:02:27.524 --> 01:02:30.526]  And I wanted to get him on to chronicle some of the route.
[01:02:30.526 --> 01:02:32.187]  Tell us what's coming up after the break, Mark.
[01:02:32.187 --> 01:02:33.567]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:02:33.567 --> 01:02:35.489]  I mean, it's just there's hundreds of things happening.
[01:02:35.489 --> 01:02:35.969]  It's amazing.
[01:02:36.533 --> 01:02:37.575]  Yeah, thank you Alex.
[01:02:37.575 --> 01:02:40.101]  Well, first of all, we have the global EPA occurring.
[01:02:40.101 --> 01:02:46.316]  We have the German scientists reversing themselves and getting major coverage by German media and Sir Spiegel and other places.
[01:02:47.122 --> 01:02:55.530]  We have a A to Z report which documents literally on almost every issue from the Arctic on down through every letter of the alphabet.
[01:02:55.530 --> 01:02:58.553]  Not only are their predictions not coming true, they're going the opposite way.
[01:02:58.553 --> 01:03:01.156]  We have global warming turning on Al Gore.
[01:03:01.156 --> 01:03:05.140]  We have a civil war among the global warming community going on.
[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:06.341]  We have new polling data.
[01:03:06.761 --> 01:03:13.008]  Continuing to show that the American public isn't buying it and the global public isn't buying it.
[01:03:13.008 --> 01:03:18.513]  111 countries, the majority of the human race is no longer afraid of man-made global warming.
[01:03:18.513 --> 01:03:23.859]  More people believe in haunted houses than man-made global warming according to Gallup polling data.
[01:03:23.859 --> 01:03:25.681]  So we have had major
[01:03:26.982 --> 01:03:31.405]  Success there, and once the public quit being interested, then the politicians dried up.
[01:03:31.405 --> 01:03:34.707]  And it's just a joy to watch this corrupt system collapse.
[01:03:34.707 --> 01:03:41.111]  But as we'll tell you after the break, they're reorganizing and they're coming after biodiversity and species extinction.
[01:03:41.111 --> 01:03:43.873]  And they're going to roll climate into that.
[01:03:43.873 --> 01:03:50.298]  So climate's not going to go away, but it's going to be consumed by a larger threat, the biodiversity and Earth Summit coming up in Rio.
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:55.001]  And we first saw them a couple years ago abandon global warming to now any change.
[01:03:55.001 --> 01:03:58.582]  And I've seen the children's TV shows now.
[01:03:58.582 --> 01:04:01.542]  They're training children that seasons are bad.
[01:04:01.542 --> 01:04:04.263]  And that if there's ever a storm, that's global warming, as you know.
[01:04:04.263 --> 01:04:08.304]  And so it gets hot and cold because they're bad.
[01:04:08.304 --> 01:04:12.485]  I mean, this is just consciously fear-mongering and brainwashing.
[01:04:13.012 --> 01:04:25.017]  Yeah, in fact, right now, the EPA is now targeting with a new Hollywood film about a Dr. Seuss character who speaks for the trees and fights rampant industrialization, unquote.
[01:04:25.017 --> 01:04:37.583]  This is gonna be our Environmental Protection Agency partnering with Hollywood to propagandize our kids through this atrocious new film coming out essentially saying all modern society is evil and bad.
[01:04:37.583 --> 01:04:38.983]  Let's talk about that when we come back.
[01:04:38.983 --> 01:04:40.604]  And again, as much as I like whales,
[01:04:41.144 --> 01:04:45.510]  And I do think a lot of big animals like that should be protected, and I don't particularly like SeaWorld.
[01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:47.833]  Those animals are in too small of tanks.
[01:04:47.833 --> 01:04:51.037]  They've now got a court case, as you know, to give them rights.
[01:04:51.037 --> 01:04:58.967]  If that happens, the roaches get rights to everything, and it's going to be the globalists that count the votes of the roaches, literally, and say, we have no rights.
[01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:04.383]  And that's exactly where they're headed.
[01:05:04.383 --> 01:05:07.906]  The people of the Great Apes Society, other things, they're gone.
[01:05:07.906 --> 01:05:13.050]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:05:13.050 --> 01:05:21.778]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:05:21.778 --> 01:05:25.842]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:05:25.842 --> 01:05:28.164]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:05:30.257 --> 01:05:34.859]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:05:34.859 --> 01:05:38.681]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[01:05:38.681 --> 01:05:39.922]  Others don't.
[01:05:39.922 --> 01:05:42.063]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:05:42.063 --> 01:05:43.844]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[01:05:43.844 --> 01:05:46.745]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:05:46.745 --> 01:05:53.369]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:05:53.369 --> 01:05:56.070]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:05:56.070 --> 01:05:58.431]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[01:05:58.431 --> 01:05:59.312]  Others don't.
[01:06:01.587 --> 01:06:03.289]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:06:03.289 --> 01:06:08.594]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:06:08.594 --> 01:06:10.136]  Saving means to make money.
[01:06:10.136 --> 01:06:18.924]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:06:19.645 --> 01:06:27.189]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:06:27.189 --> 01:06:35.194]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:06:35.194 --> 01:06:40.416]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:06:40.416 --> 01:06:42.578]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[01:07:00.410 --> 01:07:03.332]  I've been telling you about eFoods Direct for a while now.
[01:07:03.332 --> 01:07:07.014]  Here are my top 10 reasons to stock up on food from eFoods Direct.
[01:07:07.014 --> 01:07:07.534]  Number 10.
[01:07:07.534 --> 01:07:10.075]  The food I get from eFoods Direct tastes great.
[01:07:10.075 --> 01:07:10.836]  Number 9.
[01:07:10.836 --> 01:07:12.657]  The eFoods meals are easy to prepare.
[01:07:12.657 --> 01:07:16.579]  8. eFoods Direct delivers the food right to my front door.
[01:07:16.579 --> 01:07:16.879]  7.
[01:07:16.879 --> 01:07:18.840]  Most of these meals cost less than $2.
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:19.900]  6.
[01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:22.042]  With their large variety, I can eat it every day.
[01:07:23.142 --> 01:07:26.305]  I always have access to high quality and delicious food.
[01:07:26.305 --> 01:07:30.289]  Number four, eFoods products don't spoil, so I never waste any food.
[01:07:30.289 --> 01:07:33.692]  Three, eFoods uses only safe, healthy ingredients.
[01:07:33.692 --> 01:07:37.996]  Number two, I have my own food supply and don't depend on the grocery store.
[01:07:37.996 --> 01:07:43.841]  And the number one reason I promote eFoods Direct is they build special offers just for my listeners.
[01:07:44.201 --> 01:07:45.142]  Folks, don't wait.
[01:07:45.142 --> 01:07:46.403]  Get prepared now.
[01:07:46.403 --> 01:07:48.365]  We all need to be self-sufficient.
[01:07:48.365 --> 01:07:50.948]  Call eFoodsDirect at 800-409-5633 and ask for the Alex Jones Special.
[01:07:50.948 --> 01:07:53.670]  Call eFoodsDirect at 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:08:24.195 --> 01:08:47.555]  Well yesterday we had the report about the federal liars and there are literally more than 30 different ones where it's suspicious to pay for a coffee with cash or to be wearing blue jeans or to use a search engine that has a proxy server and they say get their driver's license from all customers
[01:08:49.345 --> 01:08:51.968]  When you try to pay cash.
[01:08:51.968 --> 01:08:53.249]  This is official FBI.
[01:08:53.249 --> 01:08:54.990]  These are public.
[01:08:54.990 --> 01:08:57.733]  Now they're saying if you're buying bulk food.
[01:08:57.733 --> 01:09:04.659]  Now, we told you about door-to-door stuff in Tennessee where they're going around and asking for a list of who's buying bulk food.
[01:09:04.659 --> 01:09:09.383]  And everybody freaked out and backed off that story, though I'd confirmed it was happening.
[01:09:09.383 --> 01:09:10.785]  Sure enough, the article's out.
[01:09:10.785 --> 01:09:14.268]  Feds label bulk buying of food a potential terrorist activity.
[01:09:15.862 --> 01:09:19.125]  There's a war, as Forbes reports, on lemonade stands.
[01:09:19.125 --> 01:09:21.027]  There's a war on the Second Amendment.
[01:09:21.027 --> 01:09:23.589]  I mean, there's a war on every basic form of liberty.
[01:09:23.589 --> 01:09:27.873]  This system wants you dependent.
[01:09:27.873 --> 01:09:30.956]  Now, we saw some good stuff happen last year in Congress.
[01:09:30.956 --> 01:09:40.445]  It hasn't been implemented yet, but they passed a law saying the EPA can't say that farmers can't produce dust and get $5,000 a day fines per infraction.
[01:09:42.225 --> 01:09:43.866]  I mean, that happened.
[01:09:43.866 --> 01:09:44.627]  People won't believe it.
[01:09:44.627 --> 01:09:46.868]  Guys, show them on screen or radio listeners.
[01:09:46.868 --> 01:09:52.632]  Type into the search engine the original article.
[01:09:52.632 --> 01:09:53.953]  Pull it up.
[01:09:53.953 --> 01:09:59.976]  EPA to ban dust on farms or ban hay dust.
[01:09:59.976 --> 01:10:03.459]  They were saying thousands of dollars of fines per day for dust off hay.
[01:10:04.591 --> 01:10:06.955]  In fact, EPA labels hay a pollutant.
[01:10:06.955 --> 01:10:07.656]  That was the headline.
[01:10:07.656 --> 01:10:09.438]  I mean, you cannot make this up.
[01:10:09.438 --> 01:10:10.860]  It's about total control.
[01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:14.786]  Stalin and Mao didn't let people do individual private agriculture.
[01:10:14.786 --> 01:10:17.390]  You see the banning of gardens now.
[01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:19.433]  Austin's passed a so-called law.
[01:10:20.529 --> 01:10:25.152]  Saying you gotta have regulators out at your house and you can't have chickens in your backyard.
[01:10:25.152 --> 01:10:31.376]  People who want to be sustainable, people that, yeah there it is, imaginary farm dust regulation banned by House.
[01:10:31.376 --> 01:10:36.159]  That's the Huffington Post making a joke about it because they're angry that the House woke up to what they're doing.
[01:10:36.159 --> 01:10:39.301]  So that's actually a whitewashed George Soros article there.
[01:10:39.301 --> 01:10:40.922]  But no, no, I read the regulation.
[01:10:40.922 --> 01:10:46.326]  But anyways, Mark Moreno joins us for this segment and the next to talk about what they're doing because they're back with new things.
[01:10:47.517 --> 01:10:56.380]  Well Alex, just to piggyback on what you're talking about here, in California, I think it was 2008, they tried to have the government control the thermostats in your home.
[01:10:56.380 --> 01:11:00.921]  In other words, if you light your air conditioner too cold, they would have the ability to make you warmer in the summer.
[01:11:00.921 --> 01:11:04.042]  If you thought they were too warm in the winter, they would have control over that.
[01:11:04.042 --> 01:11:07.863]  The New York Times compared it to the Outer Limits TV show at the time.
[01:11:07.863 --> 01:11:11.524]  And of course they had to back down, but it gives you the mindset of the bureaucrats.
[01:11:11.524 --> 01:11:16.666]  Japanese government's telling its citizens they have to go to bed earlier, an hour earlier, to help fight global warming.
[01:11:17.426 --> 01:11:26.913]  The head of the UN climate panel said that Americans in the Western world can't go out and enjoy ice water in restaurants because of, you know, the threats of global warming and all this.
[01:11:26.913 --> 01:11:28.334]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
[01:11:28.334 --> 01:11:31.916]  Everywhere I go in Austin now, it's a little cult thing.
[01:11:31.916 --> 01:11:33.157]  I'm like, I like a salad.
[01:11:33.157 --> 01:11:34.838]  I like that chicken breast.
[01:11:34.838 --> 01:11:36.239]  And do you want water?
[01:11:36.239 --> 01:11:36.980]  Yes.
[01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:37.720]  Are you sure?
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:39.081]  We're in a drought.
[01:11:39.081 --> 01:11:41.483]  And I'm like, you're in a drought?
[01:11:41.483 --> 01:11:44.705]  The amount of water I drink is nothing compared to the giant golf courses.
[01:11:45.525 --> 01:11:47.326]  That never get harassed for using too much.
[01:11:47.326 --> 01:11:48.286]  It's just incredible.
[01:11:48.286 --> 01:11:50.767]  It's all about government being able to impact us.
[01:11:50.767 --> 01:11:51.508]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:11:51.508 --> 01:11:53.208]  Yeah, and it's true.
[01:11:53.208 --> 01:11:55.329]  He who controls carbon dioxide controls life.
[01:11:55.329 --> 01:11:56.870]  It's a bureaucrat's dream to control it.
[01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:58.490]  But as you mentioned, they're beyond that.
[01:11:58.490 --> 01:11:59.831]  They're talking about dust.
[01:11:59.831 --> 01:12:02.632]  They're using species now, and that's where they're coming into.
[01:12:02.632 --> 01:12:10.535]  I interviewed Peter Singer, the Princeton alleged, you know, intellectual, who is a big animal rights guru.
[01:12:10.535 --> 01:12:14.697]  He openly says, euthanize babies because they have as much value as a mackerel.
[01:12:15.319 --> 01:12:20.722]  Yeah, he actually says that a newborn chimpanzee has more rights, essentially, than a newborn baby.
[01:12:20.722 --> 01:12:22.823]  He said Christianity is harmful to animals.
[01:12:22.823 --> 01:12:28.566]  He said that animals, like dogs, can consent to have sexual relations with an owner and that that should be legal.
[01:12:28.566 --> 01:12:32.749]  He's a man, when I interviewed him, he actually openly told the crowd at this animal rights convention
[01:12:33.329 --> 01:12:42.518]  That he would be hard-pressed to think that he would kill termites that were devouring his home, because what right did he have to infringe on a termite's right?
[01:12:42.518 --> 01:12:47.882]  So this is the animal rights intellectual leader who gets fawning media coverage.
[01:12:47.882 --> 01:12:49.544]  This is the kind of mentality they have.
[01:12:49.544 --> 01:12:51.446]  What they never explain in the Animal Rights Movement is
[01:12:52.066 --> 01:13:00.535]  If animals are so intelligent and so bright, why is it that animals eat other animals, but somehow humans are forbidden from eating other animals?
[01:13:00.535 --> 01:13:02.577]  Why do humans have to play by a different rule?
[01:13:02.577 --> 01:13:06.081]  And the obviously implicit answer is humans have a higher standard.
[01:13:06.081 --> 01:13:07.442]  So we're not equal to animals.
[01:13:07.442 --> 01:13:14.149]  They will admit that themselves, otherwise they would encourage... I mean, they talk about bad conditions in slaughterhouses or whatever they want to talk about.
[01:13:14.810 --> 01:13:17.752]  Go out on the African plains and see how a lion kills its animals.
[01:13:17.752 --> 01:13:19.313]  It's cruel and debasing.
[01:13:19.313 --> 01:13:26.638]  Until animal rights activists go after animals for killing animals, they have no business saying that we're equal to animals.
[01:13:26.638 --> 01:13:28.099]  And that's the bottom line on that.
[01:13:28.099 --> 01:13:40.747]  Again, obviously we should treat animals humanely and do everything we can that's within reason, particularly in terms of food production, but the idea that we're equal to animals but somehow we have to play by a different standard?
[01:13:41.778 --> 01:13:48.983]  Now Mark, I want to reset this interview because we started it earlier and it's an awesome interview.
[01:13:48.983 --> 01:13:53.326]  It's just that we need to explain why we're now off into animal rights.
[01:13:53.326 --> 01:13:56.548]  They said global cooling in the 70s, we'd all be in an ice age by 2000.
[01:13:56.548 --> 01:14:00.211]  Then in the 80s and 90s and now it's global warming.
[01:14:00.851 --> 01:14:04.114]  And carbon dioxide is going to kill everybody that plants breathe.
[01:14:04.114 --> 01:14:07.396]  And now that that's been proven to be a hoax and is imploding, let's talk about that.
[01:14:07.396 --> 01:14:10.339]  They're moving to animal rights and extinction.
[01:14:10.339 --> 01:14:13.181]  And here's the Deacon Chronicle.
[01:14:13.181 --> 01:14:15.803]  Court to decide if SeaWorld whales are illegal slaves.
[01:14:15.803 --> 01:14:16.984]  Now, I want to be clear.
[01:14:16.984 --> 01:14:20.487]  I don't like the fact that those giant whales are in tanks that are too small.
[01:14:20.487 --> 01:14:22.248]  I think they are magical creatures.
[01:14:22.248 --> 01:14:23.790]  They are intelligent.
[01:14:23.790 --> 01:14:26.992]  I think that they shouldn't be, you know, whaled to extinction.
[01:14:26.992 --> 01:14:28.173]  I get that.
[01:14:28.173 --> 01:14:29.714]  The point is they use it as a
[01:14:30.862 --> 01:14:49.237]  Cute mascot like the polar bear and then they openly have said the UN and as you are pointing out this new global EPA they will represent the monkeys and the shrimp and the roaches and outvote us and as they say we're a parasite because the globalists are eugenicists so they actually outvote us.
[01:14:50.018 --> 01:14:54.381]  And they're saying this, so that's how they're going to democratize the planet.
[01:14:54.381 --> 01:14:58.523]  It's just that humans will be outvoted by the termites and all the rest of it.
[01:14:58.523 --> 01:15:02.525]  This is how they plan to take over and bring in their new authoritarian system.
[01:15:02.525 --> 01:15:07.628]  So, like Shark Teeth, they've been using all these other hoaxes.
[01:15:07.628 --> 01:15:09.649]  Now they're coming in with this.
[01:15:09.649 --> 01:15:18.935]  Mark, please, so let's talk about their implosion, because you're the expert on this, and now their new attack paradigm, 20 years later, going back to Rio.
[01:15:19.872 --> 01:15:20.533]  Okay, yeah.
[01:15:20.533 --> 01:15:23.417]  The global warming movement began, essentially, in 1988.
[01:15:23.417 --> 01:15:26.441]  That's when the United Nations formed this climate panel.
[01:15:26.441 --> 01:15:34.732]  Now, keep in mind, the climate panel, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, that won the Nobel Prize, you hear about the media that issues assessments every six, seven years.
[01:15:35.555 --> 01:15:36.056]  We're good to go.
[01:15:58.778 --> 01:16:10.563]  That we're manipulating the process, blocking studies that disagreed, blocking data that disagreed, and then essentially sometimes generating studies that did, and coming up with all these claims to keep the narrative alive.
[01:16:10.563 --> 01:16:12.103]  Now this was all going on behind the scenes.
[01:16:12.103 --> 01:16:13.464]  It blew out wide open in 2009.
[01:16:13.464 --> 01:16:18.446]  But if you go back 2006-2007, that was the high point of the global warming movement.
[01:16:19.056 --> 01:16:24.019]  They made a couple critical mistakes by having the United Nations as the source of your science.
[01:16:24.019 --> 01:16:28.942]  As John Kerry, the Senator from Massachusetts, would like to say, it was the gold standard of science.
[01:16:28.942 --> 01:16:36.466]  If that is your gold standard of science, then you seriously have full gold on your hand, because that has proven to be nothing more than a mockery.
[01:16:36.466 --> 01:16:39.968]  It is a political institution masquerading as a science body.
[01:16:39.968 --> 01:16:42.009]  The second problem they had was Al Gore.
[01:16:42.009 --> 01:16:43.130]  Al Gore inserted himself
[01:16:43.710 --> 01:16:46.393]  Uh, even back in the 1980s he was involved in this.
[01:16:46.393 --> 01:16:54.580]  And by the way, Newt Gingrich co-authored a bill with Nancy Pelosi that didn't make it out of committee, but on man-made global warming back in 1989!
[01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:58.664]  So Newt Gingrich was already a committed believer in this stuff back in the 1980s!
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:03.805]  What happened was Al Gore is a polarizing figure.
[01:17:03.805 --> 01:17:07.870]  Whether you love him or hate him, he was never going to fly as the spokesman for global warming.
[01:17:07.870 --> 01:17:15.720]  So the UN is your source of science, Al Gore is your spokesman, and of course Al Gore's proclivity to bore and overreach didn't help either.
[01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:16.621]  And this is what happened.
[01:17:16.621 --> 01:17:17.883]  The whole movement collapsed.
[01:17:18.323 --> 01:17:18.483]  I don't
[01:17:35.598 --> 01:17:36.199]  I don't know.
[01:17:50.786 --> 01:17:51.606]  We're good to go.
[01:18:13.056 --> 01:18:20.239]  By the way, Mark, I'm not a rocket scientist, but I can go to Google's sea level gauge, where they get all the readings from all the ports in the world,
[01:18:36.124 --> 01:18:39.569]  I can go to the Navy Zone, and I did that two years ago.
[01:18:39.569 --> 01:18:46.999]  You're saying it's been dropping for two, but I went two years ago on air and showed the viewers and radio listeners, you know, put links on Infowars.com for them.
[01:18:48.030 --> 01:18:57.912]  I showed them where on average they drop by about a foot in the last decade, and then one of the few things that's been measured for hundreds of years, as you know, is sea levels.
[01:18:57.912 --> 01:19:08.474]  There were readings in London and in other ports going back hundreds and hundreds of years, and it shows it fluctuating by a few feet every few decades.
[01:19:08.474 --> 01:19:09.915]  It's just normal.
[01:19:09.915 --> 01:19:16.116]  Yes, and it's also normal to be, sea level has risen generally since the end of the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, so it's no surprise there.
[01:19:16.116 --> 01:19:16.796]  But on the other hand,
[01:19:17.552 --> 01:19:22.876]  This whole claim of Florida half underwater that Al Gore promotes, it's not there.
[01:19:22.876 --> 01:19:26.718]  And what they've done now recently, they've adjusted, they've started adjusting the number.
[01:19:26.718 --> 01:19:32.362]  They put in these fudge factors, or what critics are calling it, and they're not accounting for a lot of things.
[01:19:32.362 --> 01:19:34.423]  Sometimes sea level's not rising at all.
[01:19:34.423 --> 01:19:41.068]  It's actually the island or the land surface could be sinking in certain locations, which can affect it, and there's ways to measure that.
[01:19:41.068 --> 01:19:44.470]  But they've now put in blanket adjustments because they're embarrassed.
[01:19:44.470 --> 01:19:47.312]  That's what they're being accused of, is trying to cover up the fact
[01:19:47.592 --> 01:19:49.733]  That sea level not only isn't accelerating, it's dropping.
[01:19:49.733 --> 01:19:53.474]  And by the way, this is one promise Barack Obama kept.
[01:19:53.474 --> 01:20:05.197]  He actually said in June, actually I think it was election night, it was the fall of 2008, he actually said this, we're going to be the presidency that heals the planet and sees the sea levels drop.
[01:20:05.197 --> 01:20:06.178]  And he's actually done it.
[01:20:06.178 --> 01:20:08.979]  Since he's been president, global sea level has dropped.
[01:20:08.979 --> 01:20:13.520]  So all the criticisms you can have of Obama, one thing you can't is he kept his sea level promise.
[01:20:16.223 --> 01:20:18.585]  No, he's like God or something that you're saying.
[01:20:18.585 --> 01:20:22.408]  Yeah, he's got powers and ability far beyond those of mortal men.
[01:20:22.408 --> 01:20:29.012]  And this is, you know, and this is, but this goes across the board though, you know, Mount Kilimanjaro, a mockery, it's gaining snow and ice.
[01:20:29.012 --> 01:20:35.898]  There's a guide out there just recently, and I believe it was a Bloomberg Reuters article, the guides are saying that the snow and ice is increasing.
[01:20:35.898 --> 01:20:44.264]  And people like Michael Mann, the scientist from Penn State University, the center of the climate scandal, will still use stuff like, oh, well,
[01:20:45.024 --> 01:20:46.165]  Proof of man-made global warming.
[01:20:46.165 --> 01:20:47.345]  Look at Mount Kilimanjaro.
[01:20:47.345 --> 01:20:48.486]  The ice is melting.
[01:20:48.486 --> 01:20:49.806]  It's not anymore!
[01:20:49.806 --> 01:20:53.268]  And even if it did before, it wasn't due to global warming or temperatures.
[01:20:53.268 --> 01:20:54.889]  It was due to local land use issues.
[01:20:54.889 --> 01:20:57.990]  So, it's just, it's an amazing thing to watch this.
[01:20:57.990 --> 01:20:59.971]  I went to the UN conference in Durban.
[01:20:59.971 --> 01:21:02.352]  It was akin to medieval witchcraft.
[01:21:02.352 --> 01:21:04.393]  They no longer talk about global temperatures.
[01:21:05.254 --> 01:21:05.875]  Hardly at all.
[01:21:05.875 --> 01:21:12.181]  It's all about during the week we were here at this UN conference, there was a flood here, a hurricane here, a tornado here, an earthquake here.
[01:21:12.181 --> 01:21:16.005]  They're now turned every weather event into proof of man-made global warming.
[01:21:16.005 --> 01:21:17.587]  You can't falsify the theory.
[01:21:17.587 --> 01:21:23.573]  This is akin to the Middle Ages when you'd say we never had weather like that until that witch moved in next door.
[01:21:24.133 --> 01:21:28.556]  And Al Gore did his 24 hours of climate reality and he was ridiculed.
[01:21:28.556 --> 01:21:29.556]  I did a whole report.
[01:21:29.556 --> 01:21:36.981]  Dozens of global warming committed believers and environmental activists trashed Gore, winced, distanced themselves.
[01:21:36.981 --> 01:21:40.843]  Al Gore can no longer command his own friends to support him.
[01:21:40.843 --> 01:21:42.904]  That's how bad it's become.
[01:21:42.904 --> 01:21:49.388]  He's not groveling to none other than Keith Oberman as his only way to save his network.
[01:21:49.388 --> 01:21:53.831]  That's what Al Gore, when you have to grovel to Keith Oberman to save yourself, you're
[01:21:54.963 --> 01:21:55.963]  No, he is gone.
[01:21:55.963 --> 01:21:58.224]  So that leads us to the next question.
[01:21:58.224 --> 01:22:01.585]  We can't just let him regroup and cook up new frauds.
[01:22:01.585 --> 01:22:10.869]  20 years after Maury Strong and the UN openly said, quote, we will use environmentalism and carbon taxes to shut down the industrial world.
[01:22:10.869 --> 01:22:13.109]  Our goal is a post-industrial world.
[01:22:13.109 --> 01:22:13.970]  This official...
[01:22:14.970 --> 01:22:24.959]  Neo-feudalistic model, where government shuts down everybody but a select inter-coterie of crony capitalists, and then socializes all the other wealth to make us dependent.
[01:22:24.959 --> 01:22:26.200]  They're coming back.
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:28.882]  So, how do we stop them?
[01:22:28.882 --> 01:22:38.231]  I mean, you're explaining it's going to be, let the termites vote, you know, the government's going to represent animal rights now, species extinction.
[01:22:38.231 --> 01:22:40.132]  How do we route them?
[01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:48.462]  Well here's the thing, if they get a hold of biodiversity, which is the umbrella sustainable development, species extinction, deforestation, it's brilliant.
[01:22:48.462 --> 01:22:56.365]  It even surpasses CO2 as a master control mechanism, because now if you want to do anything, if you have
[01:22:56.465 --> 01:23:08.869]  Biodiversity, which is just essentially all ranges of the planet's systems, that means you can control the oceans, you can control fisheries, ship lanes, you can control land use, you can control transportation, roads, food distribution, agriculture.
[01:23:08.869 --> 01:23:14.090]  This is a way, in a way, they probably mishandled themselves by going after global warming in the 1980s.
[01:23:14.090 --> 01:23:20.832]  They should have committed themselves to this, because if they had achieved master control of biodiversity, like they want plants, animals, species on Earth,
[01:23:21.412 --> 01:23:25.574]  They would be able to control every possible aspect of our lives.
[01:23:25.574 --> 01:23:26.875]  And that's what they're going for.
[01:23:26.875 --> 01:23:29.376]  They're looking for a super EPA right now.
[01:23:29.376 --> 01:23:32.037]  Over 100 countries have endorsed the concept.
[01:23:32.037 --> 01:23:36.359]  And what's scary is this stuff usually happens under Republican presidents.
[01:23:36.359 --> 01:23:40.201]  George Herbert Walker Bush, the first Bush, got us into the mess in Rio.
[01:23:40.201 --> 01:23:43.583]  And I don't argue presidents should ignore these conferences.
[01:23:43.583 --> 01:23:48.905]  I think both Bushes, both the first Bush and George W. Bush, should have attended UN conferences.
[01:23:48.905 --> 01:23:50.006]  They should have given speeches.
[01:23:50.506 --> 01:23:51.427]  We're good to go.
[01:24:18.403 --> 01:24:25.189]  And I don't know exactly if Ron Paul has addressed this, has called for withdrawing from everything related to the... No, no, no.
[01:24:25.189 --> 01:24:26.830]  Ron Paul has called for the U.S.
[01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:28.151]  to get out of the U.N.
[01:24:28.151 --> 01:24:29.692]  and to get out of that.
[01:24:29.692 --> 01:24:31.334]  And he's the only one.
[01:24:31.334 --> 01:24:39.340]  And the reason is, the big mega banks, the crony capitalists, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, they fund all the environmental groups.
[01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:41.702]  They want to sell these carbon taxes.
[01:24:41.702 --> 01:24:42.402]  They want
[01:24:43.183 --> 01:24:47.727]  ...to have this new global tax that banned Kaimun, as you know, called for last week.
[01:24:47.727 --> 01:24:49.128]  That's my next question.
[01:24:49.128 --> 01:24:58.215]  Agenda 21, as you know, 20 years ago, you're about to go to the new conference, called for global governance, called for every facet of life to be controlled through Agenda 21.
[01:24:59.816 --> 01:25:01.598]  Smart growth, sustainability.
[01:25:01.598 --> 01:25:04.220]  I live in one of the few cities in the U.S.
[01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:05.842]  actually implementing it all.
[01:25:05.842 --> 01:25:07.924]  I mean, it's just hellish.
[01:25:07.924 --> 01:25:09.685]  All of this is happening.
[01:25:09.685 --> 01:25:11.947]  And so the establishment wants this.
[01:25:11.947 --> 01:25:13.569]  Mitt Romney wants it.
[01:25:13.569 --> 01:25:14.770]  Newt Gingrich wants it.
[01:25:14.770 --> 01:25:15.811]  Obama wants it.
[01:25:15.811 --> 01:25:18.113]  Because that's what the ruling elite want.
[01:25:18.113 --> 01:25:22.057]  So how do you address the New York Times article yesterday or two days ago saying,
[01:25:22.657 --> 01:25:24.780]  Well, kooks don't want agenda 21.
[01:25:24.780 --> 01:25:27.744]  It's real and taking over, but it's for your best interest.
[01:25:27.744 --> 01:25:38.679]  I mean, how is the system going to deal with the fact that people don't trust them anymore and are now aware that the UN is a front for a global corporate takeover of everybody else's systems?
[01:25:39.346 --> 01:25:41.388]  Yeah, I mean, that's a very good question.
[01:25:41.388 --> 01:25:47.675]  Agenda 21 deals with sustainable development, the economy, equity, environment, social justice.
[01:25:47.675 --> 01:25:50.598]  These are the words, code words for redistribution of wealth.
[01:25:50.598 --> 01:25:55.263]  It's essentially an abolishment of private property if they get their way, but they're smart about it.
[01:25:55.263 --> 01:25:58.346]  It's incremental, it's a little bit slower, it doesn't happen overnight.
[01:25:59.076 --> 01:26:08.989]  And what happened was this was set into motion back at the Earth Summit in 1992 when the first George Bush went, and God knows why he went and why he legitimized this and why he committed us to this, but he did.
[01:26:08.989 --> 01:26:14.957]  And now as we go forward, they're going to resurrect that now in 2012 at this conference upcoming in Rio.
[01:26:15.718 --> 01:26:15.898]  I don't
[01:26:35.348 --> 01:26:35.589]  I think?
[01:26:53.067 --> 01:26:57.549]  Again, probably much, much bigger than any previous global warming conference.
[01:26:57.549 --> 01:27:11.777]  The United Nations and the environmentalists are so excited about this conference because it's new, it's different, and they have a whole bunch of new science, in quotes, that the IPCC-like panel of the UN is already producing trying to scare people.
[01:27:11.777 --> 01:27:19.201]  What people need to realize is that 99.9% of all species have gone extinct, and extinction is a natural process.
[01:27:19.201 --> 01:27:21.442]  And to sit there and fret over every
[01:27:21.462 --> 01:27:26.085]  Every single species, they first of all claim 50,000 species go extinct a year, but they don't actually exist.
[01:27:26.085 --> 01:27:40.212]  There's things like amoebas and bacteria, when you press them to name names, they're actually just species of... No, no, they admit it's algorithms, like you said last night on the Nightly News, and I've seen that, they admit it's computer program models, but let's expand.
[01:27:40.212 --> 01:27:44.035]  Schwarzenegger said, as you know, in USA Today in 2010, he said, listen,
[01:27:46.696 --> 01:27:50.318]  We're going to go to local governments and do this since the Feds won't do it.
[01:27:50.318 --> 01:27:51.978]  Is that not infiltration?
[01:27:51.978 --> 01:28:03.284]  I mean, if the Russians came over here and said, we're going to lobby your local government and pay them off to pay us tax money, that would be treason, sedition, infiltration, espionage.
[01:28:03.284 --> 01:28:07.826]  How is it not espionage when the UN and George Soros and globalists come in?
[01:28:08.306 --> 01:28:13.147]  And say in USA Today, we're going to do an end run around your elected representatives.
[01:28:13.147 --> 01:28:14.207]  We're going to do this.
[01:28:14.207 --> 01:28:16.028]  I mean, they should be arrested.
[01:28:16.028 --> 01:28:17.708]  This is a criminal takeover.
[01:28:17.708 --> 01:28:19.269]  Let's call it what it is, Mark.
[01:28:19.269 --> 01:28:20.409]  Let's stop mincing words.
[01:28:20.409 --> 01:28:23.930]  I'm not saying you are, but I think it's time to really call it what it is.
[01:28:23.930 --> 01:28:28.431]  These are criminals trying to hijack our infrastructure, and it makes me sick.
[01:28:29.704 --> 01:28:36.190]  Well, and Arnold Schwarzenegger as a leader, they couldn't have picked a more absurd and appropriate figure.
[01:28:36.190 --> 01:28:40.514]  There's a guy who did everything wrong from their point of view.
[01:28:40.514 --> 01:28:52.485]  He flew private planes to and from work, daily commute, he had Humvee vehicles, flew all around the world, works in the most environmentally destructive industry in America, which is Hollywood film industry.
[01:28:52.865 --> 01:28:54.787]  And he is your environmental spokesman.
[01:28:54.787 --> 01:28:59.572]  So that, on the face of it, is perfectly appropriate and absurd all at the same time.
[01:28:59.572 --> 01:29:03.516]  Schwarzenegger is going around now, they're calling him the Incredible Hulk.
[01:29:03.516 --> 01:29:05.438]  He went from the Terminator to the Incredible Hulk.
[01:29:05.438 --> 01:29:10.744]  He is now the Green spokesman, the ambassador around the world, and as you mentioned, state and local governments.
[01:29:11.144 --> 01:29:15.008]  I don't know how much success they're having outside of liberal enclaves at this point.
[01:29:15.008 --> 01:29:22.495]  I believe it was the city of Boulder which tried to pass all this different cap and trade stuff and they realized they couldn't even meet the targets and they admit how hard it was.
[01:29:22.495 --> 01:29:26.739]  So the liberal bastions that have tried this stuff years ago are failing.
[01:29:26.739 --> 01:29:28.020]  So Schwarzenegger is going to go around.
[01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:30.942]  I'm sure Schwarzenegger will be at the Rio conference.
[01:29:30.942 --> 01:29:34.966]  The other person, other Hollywood actor by the way, intimately involved is Harrison Ford.
[01:29:34.966 --> 01:29:35.627]  I'd hate to see it.
[01:29:36.447 --> 01:29:37.388]  Hold on, Mark.
[01:29:37.388 --> 01:29:40.110]  I know you've got to go, but do five more minutes with us on the other side.
[01:29:40.110 --> 01:29:41.551]  I want you to be able to finish.
[01:29:41.551 --> 01:29:47.656]  Tell us what else is happening at climatedepot.com and how we beat these people, because these are the authoritarians.
[01:29:47.656 --> 01:29:50.258]  These people are scum.
[01:29:50.258 --> 01:29:51.660]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:54.182]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.182 --> 01:29:56.844]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.814 --> 01:30:05.357]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:05.357 --> 01:30:06.278]  Number one.
[01:30:06.278 --> 01:30:09.701]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.701 --> 01:30:10.561]  Number two.
[01:30:10.561 --> 01:30:15.445]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:15.445 --> 01:30:16.185]  It's true.
[01:30:16.185 --> 01:30:21.069]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:21.069 --> 01:30:21.890]  Number three.
[01:30:21.890 --> 01:30:25.472]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:25.472 --> 01:30:29.175]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:29.375 --> 01:30:30.175]  Number four.
[01:30:30.175 --> 01:30:32.936]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.936 --> 01:30:36.617]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:36.617 --> 01:30:37.397]  Number five.
[01:30:37.397 --> 01:30:41.558]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:41.558 --> 01:30:46.600]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:50.781]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:50.781 --> 01:30:52.562]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:52.562 --> 01:30:57.163]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:30:57.483 --> 01:30:57.523]  877-327-0365.
[01:31:02.486 --> 01:31:06.447]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:06.447 --> 01:31:15.308]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:31:15.308 --> 01:31:19.929]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:31:19.929 --> 01:31:30.751]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:31:31.391 --> 01:31:40.896]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:40.896 --> 01:31:46.338]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:31:46.338 --> 01:31:53.822]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:53.822 --> 01:31:56.243]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:32:01.696 --> 01:32:05.717]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:32:05.717 --> 01:32:08.958]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:32:08.958 --> 01:32:13.759]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:32:13.759 --> 01:32:20.140]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:32:20.140 --> 01:32:22.381]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:32:22.941 --> 01:32:23.241]  Tim Geithner?
[01:32:23.241 --> 01:32:23.501]  Bernanke?
[01:32:23.501 --> 01:32:23.921]  They're arsonists!
[01:32:23.921 --> 01:32:24.661]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:32:24.661 --> 01:32:26.142]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:32:41.826 --> 01:32:43.969]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:32:43.969 --> 01:32:49.114]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:32:49.114 --> 01:32:58.245]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:33:14.423 --> 01:33:17.244]  Now, you know we've had Lord Monckton on many times.
[01:33:17.244 --> 01:33:33.849]  You know I've made the film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, where the UN, Prince Philip, Ted Turner, Jacques Cousteau, Bill Gates, all of them admit environmentalism is to be used to shut off energy and reduce world population, use food as a weapon.
[01:33:33.849 --> 01:33:38.431]  Henry Kissinger, Memorandum 200, State Department, CIA.
[01:33:38.431 --> 01:33:39.531]  This is about eugenics.
[01:33:40.692 --> 01:33:52.876]  And I want to ask two questions of Mark Moreno from Climate Depot, one of the leading experts out there on this, advisor to Congress, and everything he's broken down over the last decade that I've been following him has turned out to be dead on target.
[01:33:52.876 --> 01:33:54.177]  Two things.
[01:33:54.177 --> 01:33:56.257]  How do we beat them, A, and then B?
[01:33:56.257 --> 01:33:58.818]  I'd like you to speak to the whole world government, world tax.
[01:33:58.818 --> 01:34:00.279]  It's now out in the open.
[01:34:00.279 --> 01:34:04.440]  We won't get attacked by, you know, the big neocon talk show hosts for talking about reality.
[01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:05.881]  It's out in the open now.
[01:34:06.641 --> 01:34:18.664]  The world government element, the eugenics population reduction, because Lord Monckton's numbers is if they did the Copenhagen cuts, it would be over a billion people in 10 years would die who are on $2 a day or less.
[01:34:18.664 --> 01:34:22.125]  The revolutions that'll come out of turning off the infrastructure.
[01:34:22.125 --> 01:34:23.625]  I mean, this is feudalism.
[01:34:23.625 --> 01:34:28.366]  So I'd like you to speak to their master plan and how we beat these authoritarians.
[01:34:29.485 --> 01:34:35.029]  Well, they want more primitivism back in the world.
[01:34:35.029 --> 01:34:38.672]  And overpopulation was huge in the 1960s and 70s.
[01:34:38.672 --> 01:34:41.994]  They realized soon that that imploded under its own weight.
[01:34:41.994 --> 01:34:43.055]  It's still there though.
[01:34:43.055 --> 01:34:46.117]  People like John Holdren, Obama's science lawyer, are still pushing
[01:34:46.757 --> 01:34:50.999]  Um, the idea that mankind is, you know, there's too many people on Earth and we gotta get rid of it.
[01:34:50.999 --> 01:34:56.801]  I think Bill Gates, uh, would last on record as saying that the world would be a lot better with two billion less people.
[01:34:56.801 --> 01:34:58.262]  So it's a very scary thing.
[01:34:58.262 --> 01:35:00.102]  So you look at it, you say, okay, they're worried about that.
[01:35:00.102 --> 01:35:00.923]  Well, what are their policies?
[01:35:00.923 --> 01:35:05.285]  Well, you look at their policies, 1.6 billion people don't have running water and electricity.
[01:35:05.285 --> 01:35:06.945]  Right now, they are being prevented.
[01:35:06.945 --> 01:35:13.528]  Obama's, uh, has been stopping and helping pressure to stop international development of coal plants in Africa.
[01:35:14.088 --> 01:35:20.333]  The country of Chad had a UN-inspired ban on burning charcoal, which led to, quote, desperate families.
[01:35:20.333 --> 01:35:25.337]  UK grocery stores stopped being bought local and hurt black African farmers.
[01:35:25.337 --> 01:35:30.501]  India has said they won't sign onto UN treaties when 40% of their residents don't have running water and electricity.
[01:35:30.501 --> 01:35:31.202]  John Holdren
[01:35:31.802 --> 01:35:32.163]  We're good.
[01:35:53.882 --> 01:36:01.589]  We have a record of saying that people should rather die before you would allow an agricultural revolution to feed these people.
[01:36:01.589 --> 01:36:03.991]  So they don't want the people on the planet.
[01:36:03.991 --> 01:36:10.256]  And beyond that, we have the German climate advisor calling for a CO2 budget for every man, woman, and child on the planet.
[01:36:10.256 --> 01:36:18.904]  The UK government has proposed carbon ration cards for employers to monitor their employees' train travel, air travel, your home energy use.
[01:36:19.505 --> 01:36:24.271]  Uh, and how much are you—it's the most intrusive stuff that Orwell couldn't even have contemplated.
[01:36:24.271 --> 01:36:25.493]  So this is all happening.
[01:36:25.493 --> 01:36:29.379]  Al Gore has said the climate bill was the first step toward global governance.
[01:36:29.379 --> 01:36:31.822]  So many different UN officials have called for this.
[01:36:31.822 --> 01:36:35.548]  The global EPA is now going to be on the table coming up to the Rio summit.
[01:36:36.088 --> 01:36:37.369]  This is all what's happening.
[01:36:37.369 --> 01:36:55.758]  The idea is the earth is so fragile that we've destroyed it, that people can't be left to free minds, free markets, that we need bureaucratic bean counters to essentially run our lives, everything from our shower heads, to our toilets, to our washing machines, to our dishwashers, to our ice makers, to our bedtime,
[01:36:56.538 --> 01:36:57.899]  And you go right on up the list.
[01:36:57.899 --> 01:37:05.281]  As Nancy Pelosi said in China of all places, we need a complete inventory on every aspect of our lives to fight global warming.
[01:37:05.281 --> 01:37:09.642]  And now I would add to that to fight species extinction and biodiversity.
[01:37:09.642 --> 01:37:20.345]  Remember what the founder of, Patrick Moore, the co-founder of Greenpeace has said, that today's environmental movement is probably the most anti-human agenda he's ever witnessed.
[01:37:20.345 --> 01:37:21.125]  And he's also said
[01:37:21.852 --> 01:37:25.274]  Particularly in this idea that the trees, this new film is coming out.
[01:37:25.274 --> 01:37:36.162]  The EPA is partnering with a Dr. Seuss film, Hollywood film coming out, that's going to teach kids that industrialization is bad and talk about the rights of trees.
[01:37:36.162 --> 01:37:42.286]  Remember, Patrick Moore, one of the founding members of Greenpeace, has said, if you want more trees, use more wood.
[01:37:42.286 --> 01:37:45.728]  Using wood sends a signal to the marketplace that trees have value.
[01:37:45.728 --> 01:37:48.890]  It's when something doesn't have value that it gets destroyed.
[01:37:52.092 --> 01:37:58.715]  You know, we've taken advantage of forest service programs where you pay just at cost for the pine trees and stuff.
[01:37:58.715 --> 01:38:12.581]  We've got East Texas Ranch that we've decided to put towards wild land mainly just for hunting and things because they've set up the market where you can't make money in cattle ranching by the oligopolies and combines.
[01:38:12.581 --> 01:38:15.282]  And absolutely, I've seen the major studies.
[01:38:15.282 --> 01:38:19.363]  We have more trees now, as you know Mark, than we had 150 years ago.
[01:38:19.363 --> 01:38:20.644]  Briefly tell people about that.
[01:38:22.332 --> 01:38:25.174]  People think, oh, we're disappearing trees all the time.
[01:38:25.174 --> 01:38:27.796]  Let's take, for instance, tropical rainforest.
[01:38:27.796 --> 01:38:30.898]  In the 80s and 90s, that was the eco-scare of the day.
[01:38:30.898 --> 01:38:35.221]  And you had Hollywood films like Fern Gully, National Geographic.
[01:38:35.221 --> 01:38:36.642]  Everyone was bought into it.
[01:38:36.642 --> 01:38:39.704]  That was the global warming consensus, if you will.
[01:38:39.704 --> 01:38:43.186]  Little kids were being told the Amazon was going to disappear, tropical rainforest was going to disappear.
[01:38:43.186 --> 01:38:44.327]  Well, guess what?
[01:38:44.327 --> 01:38:44.987]  Fast forward.
[01:38:44.987 --> 01:38:47.449]  I did a documentary on this in 2000.
[01:38:47.449 --> 01:38:51.452]  In 2009, the New York Times sheepishly admits that for every acre of rainforest cut,
[01:38:51.912 --> 01:38:54.433]  50 are being regenerated and growing back.
[01:38:54.433 --> 01:39:00.576]  Studies are showing that within 5 to 7, 6 or 7 years, you can't even distinguish the new forest from the old forest.
[01:39:00.576 --> 01:39:02.858]  And people say, well, these are old growth forests.
[01:39:02.858 --> 01:39:03.878]  They'll never be the same again.
[01:39:03.878 --> 01:39:04.879]  Well, guess what?
[01:39:04.879 --> 01:39:06.179]  Every forest changes.
[01:39:06.179 --> 01:39:09.021]  If you leave a forest alone, it won't be the same in 10 years.
[01:39:09.021 --> 01:39:13.723]  It's always changing in natural floods, fires, droughts, all the stuff that
[01:39:15.732 --> 01:39:21.138]  As you know, in South America, as I've seen documentaries, I've had a family that's been down there.
[01:39:21.138 --> 01:39:26.204]  In the cities, they're always battling the jungle, coming in and destroying the buildings.
[01:39:26.204 --> 01:39:29.628]  The jungle is what they're... it's ridiculous.
[01:39:29.628 --> 01:39:32.051]  And I've seen the satellite photos that you're talking about.
[01:39:32.051 --> 01:39:33.673]  The jungle's gotten bigger.
[01:39:34.493 --> 01:39:39.138]  Areas that do get mined or wooded or logged grow back.
[01:39:39.138 --> 01:39:40.620]  It's just insane.
[01:39:40.620 --> 01:39:41.581]  Here's the final point.
[01:39:41.581 --> 01:39:43.803]  Here's Bill Gates today and the London Guardian.
[01:39:43.803 --> 01:39:49.910]  Bill Gates backs climate scientists lobbying for large-scale geoengineering.
[01:39:50.530 --> 01:39:55.331]  And again, he's got his money tax-free in companies that actually make profits.
[01:39:55.331 --> 01:40:00.792]  He's got to be our world savior, and we've got to pay him to control the weather.
[01:40:00.792 --> 01:40:03.593]  These people want to run everything.
[01:40:03.593 --> 01:40:09.774]  So they're going to openly manipulate the weather, test things on us, and then charge us tax money.
[01:40:09.774 --> 01:40:12.755]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:14.751]  Yeah, and this is the new thing.
[01:40:14.751 --> 01:40:20.438]  There's all kinds of attempts to get money for what they call geoengineering of the climate.
[01:40:20.438 --> 01:40:24.902]  And we had the same thing back in the 1970s when they were worried about man-made global cooling.
[01:40:24.902 --> 01:40:30.889]  They were talking about putting black soot on the Arctic ice cap to try to absorb sunlight and melt it.
[01:40:31.229 --> 01:40:34.290]  I don't know what Bill Gates' personal belief is, but they wouldn't say they're gods anymore.
[01:40:34.290 --> 01:40:35.770]  They now think that they can control the weather.
[01:40:55.095 --> 01:40:55.776]  Thank you.
[01:41:11.806 --> 01:41:20.736]  Well, Mark Moreno, thank you so much for spending time with us and obviously we'll get you and Lord Monkton and others on when you're down there at this big summit coming up.
[01:41:20.736 --> 01:41:22.718]  Hopefully they won't try to have you arrested again.
[01:41:22.718 --> 01:41:25.621]  Hopefully they won't beat up Lord Monkton again, the police.
[01:41:25.621 --> 01:41:29.426]  Hopefully they won't try to ban you from your own meeting rooms.
[01:41:29.426 --> 01:41:30.687]  But they are authoritarians.
[01:41:30.687 --> 01:41:31.968]  I think the solution lies
[01:41:32.589 --> 01:41:37.913]  In realizing that we always think of a dictator or a corrupt group as looking like Mao Zedong or Hitler.
[01:41:37.913 --> 01:41:53.847]  This is the 21st century and these are just carpet-bagging scam artists who go around the world running different types of fraud that's all guilt-based and that they really are dangerous authoritarians and just recognize them for what they are.
[01:41:53.847 --> 01:41:59.972]  My frustration is they block out any real environmental concerns for sensible things
[01:42:01.232 --> 01:42:05.335]  And basically gobble up all the support for their power grabs.
[01:42:05.335 --> 01:42:12.179]  Yeah, in fact, polling data has shown that among environmental concerns, global warming is dead last among the public.
[01:42:12.179 --> 01:42:15.181]  And, you know, there are environmental, real environmental problems.
[01:42:15.181 --> 01:42:17.442]  We were in the Senate Environmental Public Works Committee.
[01:42:17.442 --> 01:42:20.564]  We spent the entire year doing 24 global warming hearings.
[01:42:20.564 --> 01:42:26.007]  Even the environmentalists were getting frustrated that it was Barbara Boxer's focus just on global warming.
[01:42:26.007 --> 01:42:29.109]  Now, I think it's probably a good thing, given the overreach of the federal government,
[01:42:29.469 --> 01:42:48.318]  But the bottom line is, if there are any real problems, i.e., and most of these are local issues, whether it's water pollution, land use issues, or some kind of chemical dumping, so those are the kind of things that are legitimate, that should be focused on, that you can deal with through the local courts and legal rights, not big, broad, sweeping,
[01:42:48.778 --> 01:42:49.959]  Thank you so much.
[01:42:49.959 --> 01:42:50.840]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[01:43:20.046 --> 01:43:21.007]  Thank you.
[01:43:21.007 --> 01:43:33.297]  Folks, what's so frustrating for me in the final equation here is that genetic engineering... I'm not talking about crossing two types of rice.
[01:43:33.297 --> 01:43:40.963]  I'm talking about putting insect genes, putting other genes in where the rice or the corn or whatever the case is produces
[01:43:41.946 --> 01:43:48.908]  Chemicals, produces drugs, splicing animals with other animals, insects with fish.
[01:43:48.908 --> 01:43:53.709]  All of this is going on and it's giving rise to mutated viruses and bacteria.
[01:43:53.709 --> 01:43:56.549]  It's jumping into other species.
[01:43:56.549 --> 01:44:08.332]  It's doing things that irrevocably have already damaged our planet and they're piggybacking the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, all of them.
[01:44:08.332 --> 01:44:08.852]  This is the key.
[01:44:10.270 --> 01:44:23.776]  They are piggybacking into these systems that in all mammal species are reducing fertility and causing deformities and toxicity.
[01:44:23.776 --> 01:44:39.204]  Now, that piggybacked kill switch and the terminator seeds and the rest of it so they can't reproduce seeds, and the other backdoors that are causing the infertility in the mice, that's now been proven to have jumped into every known corn species on Earth.
[01:44:40.268 --> 01:44:46.430]  Six varieties of BT corn, it's jumped into every, there's thousands of varieties of corn.
[01:44:46.430 --> 01:44:49.271]  There's over a thousand in Mexico alone where corn originated.
[01:44:49.271 --> 01:44:51.232]  Cultivated corn.
[01:44:51.232 --> 01:44:54.393]  Devastating everything.
[01:44:54.393 --> 01:45:05.917]  And all over the world, in Africa, in countries there, in Mexico, the villagers get this GMO corn, they eat it, they get sick, their animals won't eat it, I've seen the documentaries, and
[01:45:07.608 --> 01:45:12.032]  They also show how the next generation, the corn oil grows weird, is deformed.
[01:45:12.032 --> 01:45:14.114]  They're like, this is not good corn.
[01:45:14.114 --> 01:45:16.636]  And they show how it's jumped into all their old species of corn.
[01:45:16.636 --> 01:45:19.398]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[01:45:19.398 --> 01:45:21.140]  It is unbelievable.
[01:45:21.140 --> 01:45:21.821]  Oh, let's put...
[01:45:23.803 --> 01:45:26.024]  Six different species into a monkey.
[01:45:26.024 --> 01:45:28.706]  Let's have humanoids with five different parents.
[01:45:28.706 --> 01:45:34.269]  Let's put 20 different insect genes into a fish and release it in the ocean.
[01:45:34.269 --> 01:45:35.770]  And then all sorts of weird stuff.
[01:45:35.770 --> 01:45:37.671]  I've seen the studies of these fish.
[01:45:37.671 --> 01:45:41.973]  They'll start growing... One of the fish has corn in it.
[01:45:41.973 --> 01:45:45.495]  It'll start growing corn in its intestines.
[01:45:45.495 --> 01:45:49.417]  Or it'll start growing insect teeth
[01:45:50.603 --> 01:45:51.524]  On its scales.
[01:45:51.524 --> 01:45:53.386]  I mean, it's like, what is that?
[01:45:53.386 --> 01:45:58.892]  They've got oak trees now, they've documented, with wheat and corn growing out of them.
[01:45:58.892 --> 01:46:00.353]  It's just jumping into everything.
[01:46:00.353 --> 01:46:05.038]  I mean, we'll be lucky if we make it out of this.
[01:46:05.038 --> 01:46:08.502]  They've got rotting nuclear reactors everywhere that are 40 years old.
[01:46:10.419 --> 01:46:14.042]  Melting down, blowing up, leaking radiation, and used to be a big deal.
[01:46:14.042 --> 01:46:20.447]  It's like, oh yeah, Southern California, Illinois, New York, yeah, it leaks some radiation.
[01:46:20.447 --> 01:46:22.088]  Yeah, don't worry about it.
[01:46:22.088 --> 01:46:25.631]  Oh, you're finding it's in the milk 35 times what it should be?
[01:46:25.631 --> 01:46:26.871]  Well, we'll just raise it.
[01:46:26.871 --> 01:46:28.212]  Oh, EPA raised the level.
[01:46:28.212 --> 01:46:29.634]  It's fine.
[01:46:29.634 --> 01:46:32.155]  Well, I know in the past we said don't drink the milk.
[01:46:32.155 --> 01:46:33.857]  You'll get it from out of state or somewhere else.
[01:46:33.857 --> 01:46:35.198]  But just drink it now.
[01:46:37.383 --> 01:46:41.827]  Well I know in the past when Chernobyl went off in local areas they said don't eat the produce, but you know what?
[01:46:41.827 --> 01:46:45.111]  Government says it's fine.
[01:46:45.111 --> 01:46:49.175]  There's this... It's more than just a globalist.
[01:46:49.175 --> 01:46:53.859]  It is just this attitude that you can get away with anything you want.
[01:46:53.859 --> 01:46:54.340]  It's amazing.
[01:46:57.315 --> 01:47:00.557]  You know, I said I would get to this at the bottom of the hour, but I went too long with Mark Moreno.
[01:47:00.557 --> 01:47:01.438]  Here's what I'm going to do right now.
[01:47:01.438 --> 01:47:08.442]  I'm going to take calls for a couple of segments, because I really want to properly have some time to cover this.
[01:47:08.442 --> 01:47:12.885]  And at 8 after, I'm going to get into this article that I'm begging everyone to get out to everyone they know.
[01:47:12.885 --> 01:47:15.427]  It is so important.
[01:47:15.427 --> 01:47:22.452]  If you go to InfoWars.com, and there's a lot of just off-the-chart news proving everything the globalists are doing.
[01:47:23.564 --> 01:47:26.945]  Report, British special forces aiding rebels in Syria.
[01:47:26.945 --> 01:47:33.448]  Paul Joseph Watson, Russians are putting in spitsnats.
[01:47:33.448 --> 01:47:36.649]  World War III, most analysts say it's a possibility.
[01:47:36.649 --> 01:47:38.090]  War looks like it's inevitable.
[01:47:38.090 --> 01:47:39.050]  I mean, a big hot war.
[01:47:39.050 --> 01:47:41.331]  This is a war going on.
[01:47:41.331 --> 01:47:43.232]  A proxy war already.
[01:47:43.232 --> 01:47:47.774]  A globalist campaign calls for abolishment of Constitution.
[01:47:47.774 --> 01:47:50.235]  Time Magazine, Newsweek, New York Times.
[01:47:52.688 --> 01:47:54.349]  CNN, I mean, it's all in the article.
[01:47:54.349 --> 01:47:56.030]  They're just all saying get rid of it.
[01:47:56.030 --> 01:48:04.313]  I mean, they've already illegally ignored it, but now they want to openly have contempt for it so nobody figures out, hey, what you've done is illegal.
[01:48:04.313 --> 01:48:06.534]  This says you're criminals.
[01:48:06.534 --> 01:48:08.595]  This explained all this was going to happen.
[01:48:08.595 --> 01:48:10.616]  This was designed to stop you.
[01:48:10.616 --> 01:48:13.458]  Read the Declaration of Independence, Constitution, Bill of Rights.
[01:48:13.458 --> 01:48:14.078]  They all go together.
[01:48:17.256 --> 01:48:20.559]  I mean, the model for private property and true liberty.
[01:48:20.559 --> 01:48:30.508]  But they're pushing, in the articles, global democracy, where they hype up groups, have election fraud, whatever, and say, well, 51% says we're going to take all your property.
[01:48:30.508 --> 01:48:30.888]  49%.
[01:48:30.888 --> 01:48:34.892]  And then, of course, people stop producing because they're just going to take it from you.
[01:48:34.892 --> 01:48:35.912]  You get price controls.
[01:48:36.633 --> 01:48:38.934]  A giant welfare class, everything falls apart.
[01:48:38.934 --> 01:48:42.455]  That's what they've been maneuvering us towards this whole time.
[01:48:42.455 --> 01:48:46.796]  And now regulations to shut down industry, farms, jack up your power prices.
[01:48:46.796 --> 01:48:50.337]  It's about, they don't want you being prosperous.
[01:48:50.337 --> 01:48:52.858]  The globalists have always hated Americans.
[01:48:52.858 --> 01:48:54.579]  How do you truly destroy your enemy?
[01:48:54.579 --> 01:48:58.820]  You come in, take them over, tax them, build a corporate empire.
[01:48:59.460 --> 01:49:04.285]  A private corporate global empire out of the American will, money, ingenuity.
[01:49:04.285 --> 01:49:08.069]  Dumb them down, feed them garbage, give them poison.
[01:49:08.069 --> 01:49:11.693]  Use the media to turn them into torture-loving animals.
[01:49:11.693 --> 01:49:13.575]  Turn us into demon goblins.
[01:49:13.575 --> 01:49:17.319]  Demonize Americans that are still Americans and understand what's going on.
[01:49:17.319 --> 01:49:19.101]  Call us extremists, call us terrorists.
[01:49:23.413 --> 01:49:27.276]  And then stage terror attacks with the Al-Qaeda that you control and run.
[01:49:27.276 --> 01:49:30.878]  Most even the low-level Al-Qaeda doesn't even know that.
[01:49:30.878 --> 01:49:34.280]  Launch all these wars, use Al-Qaeda against your other enemies.
[01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:37.522]  You think your public's so dumb they won't even notice that.
[01:49:37.522 --> 01:49:45.487]  And then have every publication in the country, constantly, I'm not even looking for these articles, and they're everywhere.
[01:49:45.487 --> 01:49:47.309]  I'm at a
[01:49:48.962 --> 01:49:52.404]  Friends House, and CNN's on, and they're bad-mouthing the Constitution.
[01:49:52.404 --> 01:49:54.545]  It's old, it's bad, it's stupid!
[01:49:54.545 --> 01:49:54.926]  Oh really?
[01:49:54.926 --> 01:49:56.066]  It's old, it's bad, it's stupid?
[01:49:56.066 --> 01:49:58.128]  Have you read the Declaration of Independence?
[01:49:58.128 --> 01:50:00.489]  It's like deja vu, it's happening right now.
[01:50:00.489 --> 01:50:11.856]  Have you read how the Constitution knows that government's gonna try to get big, so you set the powers against each other, and you have all these checks and balances, and it says, and this doesn't give you your rights, it only points it out?
[01:50:13.356 --> 01:50:18.760]  Toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:21.902]  800-259-9231 on any of the issues I've covered.
[01:50:21.902 --> 01:50:23.843]  We'll take a few segments of calls.
[01:50:23.843 --> 01:50:25.304]  Then I'll get into this story in detail.
[01:50:25.304 --> 01:50:26.345]  I'll read it.
[01:50:26.345 --> 01:50:29.326]  Here's the New York Times article that sent me off the deep end.
[01:50:29.326 --> 01:50:33.009]  We the people loses appeal with people around the world.
[01:50:33.009 --> 01:50:38.032]  Really, the idea that we the people are sovereign and the government isn't God.
[01:50:38.032 --> 01:50:40.454]  You've seen all the articles, bad-mouthing Declaration of Independence.
[01:50:41.954 --> 01:50:43.215]  Remember that headline a few months ago?
[01:50:43.215 --> 01:50:45.337]  Is the Declaration of Independence illegal?
[01:50:45.337 --> 01:50:54.444]  And I've got the feds on tape saying it is illegal because it says you have a right to revolt against a criminal government who becomes destructive of your basic liberties.
[01:50:54.444 --> 01:50:58.027]  Of course they're attacking it because it's so good!
[01:50:58.027 --> 01:50:59.929]  It's so good!
[01:50:59.929 --> 01:51:01.350]  It's built to stop criminals!

[01:52:22.005 --> 01:52:26.508]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[01:52:26.508 --> 01:52:32.252]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[01:52:32.572 --> 01:52:34.373]  Use it anytime you're away from home.

[01:54:07.376 --> 01:54:12.979]  Coming up, Bill clears path for 30,000 surveillance drones over the U.S.
[01:54:12.979 --> 01:54:14.620]  in the next 10 years.
[01:54:14.620 --> 01:54:18.462]  Critics warn military-industrial complex pushing U.S.
[01:54:18.462 --> 01:54:21.344]  willy-nilly towards an era of aerial surveillance.
[01:54:21.344 --> 01:54:21.764]  Think so?
[01:54:23.137 --> 01:54:26.319]  Another InfoWars.com article by Paul Watson.
[01:54:26.319 --> 01:54:34.005]  Feds label bulk buying of food a potential terrorist activity, despite FEMA itself spent $1 billion in affordable foods last year alone.
[01:54:34.005 --> 01:54:35.786]  They don't want prisoners.
[01:54:35.786 --> 01:54:38.428]  Can a prisoner have food stored up?
[01:54:38.428 --> 01:54:40.049]  Can a prisoner grow a garden if they want?
[01:54:40.049 --> 01:54:40.269]  No.
[01:54:40.269 --> 01:54:41.630]  You're a prisoner.
[01:54:41.630 --> 01:54:47.855]  America's being, and Europe as well, into a giant surveillance camp with spies everywhere.
[01:54:47.855 --> 01:54:48.876]  I've got the flyers here.
[01:54:48.876 --> 01:54:51.998]  There's more than 30 of them going out to every business you can imagine.
[01:54:53.399 --> 01:55:02.363]  And it's saying, require driver's license to use cash, cash is terrorism, pay him for cash, just everything.
[01:55:02.363 --> 01:55:07.885]  Everywhere you go now, there's little control freaks asking you questions and acting like you've done something wrong.
[01:55:07.885 --> 01:55:13.448]  Instead of being concerned about the real crooks, like our founders said, the government.
[01:55:13.448 --> 01:55:14.768]  Don't trust the government.
[01:55:14.768 --> 01:55:15.749]  Watch it.
[01:55:15.749 --> 01:55:17.349]  Keep it on a short leash.
[01:55:17.349 --> 01:55:18.350]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[01:55:18.350 --> 01:55:19.510]  Let it do whatever it wants.
[01:55:19.510 --> 01:55:20.891]  It's the people that have to be watched.
[01:55:21.775 --> 01:55:24.437]  Tim, Michael, Jordan, Adrian, Bill, we'll get to all of you.
[01:55:24.437 --> 01:55:25.637]  Tim in Georgia, you're on the air.
[01:55:25.637 --> 01:55:28.439]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:55:28.439 --> 01:55:29.940]  Good.
[01:55:29.940 --> 01:55:38.404]  Hey man, I live in Spaulding County in Georgia, and I have a friend, he's a deputy sheriff.
[01:55:38.404 --> 01:55:50.471]  The sheriff had a meeting about two, three weeks ago, and he was told to start, or all the sheriffs were told to start compiling lists of subversive people in the county.
[01:55:52.677 --> 01:56:01.963]  Yeah, and again, these are political officers, it's not a compiled list of drug dealers, or compiled list, no, it's people who know the government's criminal.
[01:56:01.963 --> 01:56:16.192]  No, no, we have a criminal government that works for foreign banks, that's stolen 27 plus trillion, and they are going to try to march the stupid minions of the system up against the public, but the smart people in the system aren't going to go along with it.
[01:56:16.192 --> 01:56:17.313]  What does your buddy say to this?
[01:56:18.962 --> 01:56:24.268]  He said he would be on that list, that there was no way in Hades that he would be doing that.
[01:56:24.268 --> 01:56:26.811]  But see, you see what's happening.
[01:56:26.811 --> 01:56:30.415]  And of course this is also in the news what you're talking about right now, so it's not just what he's telling you.
[01:56:31.383 --> 01:56:33.765]  This is only going to wake everybody up!
[01:56:33.765 --> 01:56:39.791]  I can't tell you how many cops come up to me on the street now in Austin and other parts of the country and say, I used to think you were a kook.
[01:56:39.791 --> 01:56:41.093]  I can't talk about it.
[01:56:41.093 --> 01:56:42.754]  Everything you said is true.
[01:56:42.754 --> 01:56:44.036]  And you're right.
[01:56:44.036 --> 01:56:47.279]  And so that's just waking everybody up.
[01:56:47.279 --> 01:56:50.042]  Did you ask him how many other people on the force are waking up?
[01:56:51.700 --> 01:56:55.921]  He said the majority of the sheriff in my county are pretty decent people.
[01:56:55.921 --> 01:57:00.983]  He said some of the younger ones have been indoctrinated in this whole thing.
[01:57:00.983 --> 01:57:05.444]  But most of the older guys, they won't go for that.
[01:57:05.444 --> 01:57:07.205]  I mean, haven't they watched Red Dawn?
[01:57:07.205 --> 01:57:11.806]  I mean, don't they know this is like right out of the Soviet Union?
[01:57:11.806 --> 01:57:15.588]  I mean, this is the opposite of America?
[01:57:15.588 --> 01:57:16.148]  It's crazy.
[01:57:17.423 --> 01:57:20.525]  Now, of course, I'm sure they gave him manuals on what the extremists are.
[01:57:20.525 --> 01:57:23.307]  People that pay cash, people that have Ron Paul stickers.
[01:57:23.307 --> 01:57:24.308]  I mean, is it stuff like that?
[01:57:24.308 --> 01:57:26.750]  Uh, probably so.
[01:57:26.750 --> 01:57:29.071]  I'll get back with him and ask him more questions.
[01:57:29.071 --> 01:57:30.893]  I'll get back with him and let you know.
[01:57:30.893 --> 01:57:32.934]  Well, you know, he ought to run against that sheriff.
[01:57:32.934 --> 01:57:34.795]  You guys need to get rid of that sheriff.
[01:57:34.795 --> 01:57:36.156]  You know, the opposite's happening, too.
[01:57:36.156 --> 01:57:37.837]  You know, a lot of sheriffs are waking up right now.
[01:57:37.837 --> 01:57:38.258]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:57:39.532 --> 01:57:58.143]  I was also going to say that I have a friend that works with DSA and DFW and he said that he was actually present at the molestation of Miss America and he said that she was becoming combative but I understand that if somebody was wanting to do what they do, I'd be combative also.
[01:57:58.143 --> 01:58:02.085]  And your buddy thought it was okay?
[01:58:03.673 --> 01:58:08.137]  Um, he seems rather indifferent because I don't think he's awake, man.
[01:58:08.137 --> 01:58:08.978]  I'm trying my best.
[01:58:08.978 --> 01:58:11.180]  I get him on the phone from time to time and talk to him.
[01:58:11.180 --> 01:58:12.701]  I've spent 29 years in Dallas.
[01:58:12.701 --> 01:58:14.723]  I'm in Georgia now.
[01:58:14.723 --> 01:58:23.131]  Wow, so your old buddy, he thinks she's weird because she didn't like him going in her pants?
[01:58:23.131 --> 01:58:24.812]  Well, he just said he was present.
[01:58:24.812 --> 01:58:25.893]  I don't think he was the one.
[01:58:25.893 --> 01:58:26.994]  I mean, imagine though.
[01:58:26.994 --> 01:58:28.676]  Miss USA is wearing tight.
[01:58:30.351 --> 01:58:31.613]  Uh, like all these women do.
[01:58:31.613 --> 01:58:36.299]  Tight exercise sweats and you go in her panties?
[01:58:36.299 --> 01:58:37.560]  I mean, this is rape!
[01:58:37.560 --> 01:58:41.605]  This is sexual assault!
[01:58:41.605 --> 01:58:45.130]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:51.052 --> 01:58:52.353]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.353 --> 01:58:57.955]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:58:57.955 --> 01:59:02.957]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:59:02.957 --> 01:59:03.437]  It's true.
[01:59:03.437 --> 01:59:07.999]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:59:08.539 --> 01:59:13.765]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:59:13.765 --> 01:59:20.893]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:59:20.893 --> 01:59:21.994]  And here's the best part.
[01:59:21.994 --> 01:59:28.361]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:59:28.681 --> 01:59:31.863]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:59:31.863 --> 01:59:34.085]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[01:59:35.226 --> 01:59:38.668]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:59:38.668 --> 01:59:40.409]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:59:54.019 --> 01:59:56.401]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.401 --> 02:00:05.789]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.789 --> 02:00:07.090]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.090 --> 02:00:08.871]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.871 --> 02:00:10.612]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.612 --> 02:00:12.214]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.214 --> 02:00:14.135]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.135 --> 02:00:17.958]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.958 --> 02:00:22.042]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.268 --> 02:00:28.293]  Even the Washington Post is coming out and saying Obama runs roughshod over religious freedom.
[02:00:28.293 --> 02:00:33.518]  Got the big report coming up after the break.
[02:00:33.518 --> 02:00:38.042]  Dealing with the open assault on the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:00:38.042 --> 02:00:39.924]  Let's go back to your calls.
[02:00:39.924 --> 02:00:42.487]  Michael in South Carolina, you're on the air.
[02:00:42.487 --> 02:00:43.688]  Welcome.
[02:00:43.688 --> 02:00:44.128]  Michelle.
[02:00:44.128 --> 02:00:45.349]  It's Michelle.
[02:00:47.097 --> 02:00:47.398]  Go ahead.
[02:00:47.398 --> 02:00:48.058]  Hello?
[02:00:48.058 --> 02:00:48.619]  Yep.
[02:00:48.619 --> 02:00:50.421]  Oh, hi.
[02:00:50.421 --> 02:00:51.422]  First of all, I love your show.
[02:00:51.422 --> 02:00:55.026]  I subscribe to Prison Planet TV.
[02:00:55.026 --> 02:00:58.270]  I just had a comment question, basically.
[02:00:58.270 --> 02:01:06.279]  My husband calls me a conspiracy theorist, and so I was really surprised last night to find him watching that new show Doomsday Preppers.
[02:01:07.145 --> 02:01:13.715]  On National Geographic, where they have people preparing for solar flares, economic crash.
[02:01:13.715 --> 02:01:18.602]  And then making fun of them, meanwhile the government has spent trillions in the aggregate on it itself.
[02:01:18.602 --> 02:01:22.948]  Yeah, you're bad if you want to be self-sufficient, but government is self-sufficient.
[02:01:24.071 --> 02:01:34.273]  Exactly, and at the end they were rating it saying, well the possibility of this happening is 0.2% and you know, I found it amazing.
[02:01:34.273 --> 02:01:43.676]  But also I just wanted to throw out another, just real quick comment to all the parents out there who are thinking of vaccinating their kids.
[02:01:43.676 --> 02:01:46.316]  Just really look into it.
[02:01:46.316 --> 02:01:51.938]  You know, my son was diagnosed with autism.
[02:01:51.938 --> 02:01:52.938]  But I'm working with
[02:01:54.253 --> 02:01:55.354]  I'm Adrienne Gold.
[02:01:55.354 --> 02:02:03.082]  I just started working with her through longevity and we're trying to get my son on some supplements.
[02:02:03.933 --> 02:02:04.953]  Well, they say that's good.
[02:02:04.953 --> 02:02:08.095]  They say a lot of it's diet from some of the research that's been done, but God bless you.
[02:02:08.095 --> 02:02:13.017]  You know, I'm really sorry to hear that your husband makes fun of you, Michelle.
[02:02:13.017 --> 02:02:16.298]  It's a tiny screen with names on it.
[02:02:16.298 --> 02:02:20.480]  I guess my eyes aren't as good as they used to be because I'm always reading Michelle as Michael.
[02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:25.162]  But I'm sorry to hear that things like that are happening.
[02:02:26.803 --> 02:02:31.584]  I mean, does he think questioning a known lying government is a conspiracy theory?
[02:02:31.584 --> 02:02:33.665]  Because that's pretty much the new definition.
[02:02:33.665 --> 02:02:37.266]  Questioning known liars is conspiracy theory.
[02:02:37.266 --> 02:02:38.126]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:02:38.126 --> 02:02:43.788]  I mean, we had an argument last week over the validity of chemtrails.
[02:02:43.788 --> 02:02:48.669]  Because we both work, we're civilian, but we both work out at Shaw Air Force Base.
[02:02:48.669 --> 02:02:54.651]  And you go out there and there's these crisscross patterns all over the sky and he's saying, oh no, that's just condensation.
[02:02:55.458 --> 02:03:03.787]  Well, I mean, to be specific, there's some folks that think every trail is a geoengineering trail, but the geoengineering is going on.
[02:03:03.787 --> 02:03:08.853]  There are the patents to add the chemicals to jet fuel, so even the pilots don't know.
[02:03:08.853 --> 02:03:16.241]  And I know that, I mean, growing up, trails never sat in the sky more than just
[02:03:17.219 --> 02:03:18.140]  You know, a minute or two.
[02:03:18.140 --> 02:03:19.301]  Now they're there for hours.
[02:03:19.301 --> 02:03:20.743]  I mean, I want to know what changed.
[02:03:20.743 --> 02:03:33.517]  I mean, there's photos and video we've gotten where there's like a hundred trails in the sky in perfect crisscrosses, and NASA admits that jet trails have made the Earth 20 to 30 percent, depending on which area, darker in the last decade.
[02:03:33.517 --> 02:03:38.042]  I mean, you know, they've got Matrix movies about, you know, Kim trailing the sky.
[02:03:38.042 --> 02:03:38.842]  I mean, uh...
[02:03:40.094 --> 02:03:54.139]  I just read where Bill Gates says geoengineer, terraform the planet, and then I've got the White House, show your husband the White House science czar three years ago admitting that they're manipulating the weather with barium salts, aluminum dioxide.
[02:03:54.139 --> 02:03:56.379]  Just what the chemtrail experts said 16, 17 years ago.
[02:03:58.294 --> 02:04:00.235]  Was what they tested and said this was.
[02:04:00.235 --> 02:04:01.355]  You understand?
[02:04:01.355 --> 02:04:07.478]  We called, and I had environmental experts on, pilots, people that went up and got samples.
[02:04:07.478 --> 02:04:10.099]  They said aluminum dioxide, barium salts, and other things.
[02:04:10.099 --> 02:04:17.141]  And guess exactly what government says they've been testing and are now about to go fully operational with, but details remain classified.
[02:04:17.141 --> 02:04:19.062]  The exact same chemicals.
[02:04:19.062 --> 02:04:20.803]  I mean, how did we call it exactly right?
[02:04:21.676 --> 02:04:21.856]  She does.
[02:04:21.856 --> 02:04:22.697]  She does.
[02:04:22.697 --> 02:04:23.117]  We have a bet.
[02:04:23.117 --> 02:04:26.180]  We have a bet right now about whether gas prices are going to go up or down.
[02:04:43.519 --> 02:04:44.480]  I've tried.
[02:04:44.480 --> 02:04:47.683]  So that doesn't exist either?
[02:04:47.683 --> 02:04:56.771]  See, they precondition and say something doesn't exist when it's secret, then even when it's public, they won't admit it's happening because then they look silly.
[02:04:56.771 --> 02:04:57.512]  It's just amazing.
[02:04:57.512 --> 02:04:58.132]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:58.132 --> 02:04:58.633]  Thank you so much.
[02:05:01.383 --> 02:05:04.305]  I've been telling you about eFoods Direct for a while now.
[02:05:04.305 --> 02:05:07.987]  Here are my top 10 reasons to stock up on food from eFoods Direct.
[02:05:07.987 --> 02:05:08.507]  Number 10.
[02:05:08.507 --> 02:05:11.069]  The food I get from eFoods Direct tastes great.
[02:05:11.069 --> 02:05:11.810]  Number 9.
[02:05:11.810 --> 02:05:13.651]  The eFoods meals are easy to prepare.
[02:05:13.651 --> 02:05:17.573]  8. eFoods Direct delivers the food right to my front door.
[02:05:17.573 --> 02:05:17.873]  7.
[02:05:17.873 --> 02:05:19.815]  Most of these meals cost less than $2.
[02:05:19.815 --> 02:05:20.875]  6.
[02:05:20.875 --> 02:05:23.077]  With their large variety, I can eat it every day. 5.
[02:05:23.857 --> 02:05:24.277]  We're good to go!
[02:05:43.474 --> 02:05:44.215]  We're good to go.
[02:06:01.269 --> 02:06:07.911]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:06:07.911 --> 02:06:13.053]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:06:13.053 --> 02:06:27.798]  There's a place down in Tennessee Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[02:06:30.151 --> 02:06:34.875]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:06:34.875 --> 02:06:38.718]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[02:06:38.718 --> 02:06:39.959]  Others don't.
[02:06:39.959 --> 02:06:42.080]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:06:42.080 --> 02:06:43.882]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:06:43.882 --> 02:06:46.764]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[02:07:04.749 --> 02:07:06.010]  Tyranny is here.
[02:07:06.010 --> 02:07:09.871]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:07:09.871 --> 02:07:12.172]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:07:12.172 --> 02:07:18.035]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[02:07:18.035 --> 02:07:24.297]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:07:24.717 --> 02:07:30.658]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:07:30.658 --> 02:07:34.859]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:07:34.859 --> 02:07:39.140]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:07:39.140 --> 02:07:45.101]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:07:45.101 --> 02:07:48.641]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:07:48.641 --> 02:07:50.622]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:07:50.622 --> 02:07:51.062]  It's here.

[02:08:02.068 --> 02:08:04.850]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.850 --> 02:08:07.651]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:23.280 --> 02:08:25.343]  Alright, I want to continue with your calls.
[02:08:25.343 --> 02:08:27.846]  So much out-of-control breaking news is coming out.
[02:08:27.846 --> 02:08:31.830]  I've somehow got to get to, I don't know, the 200 articles or so that are in front of me.
[02:08:31.830 --> 02:08:34.594]  I never will, but I'll get to some of it.
[02:08:34.594 --> 02:08:37.357]  The top stories at InfoWars.com.
[02:08:37.357 --> 02:08:41.442]  Bill clears path for 30,000 surveillance drones over U.S.
[02:08:43.353 --> 02:08:45.214]  It's your tax money after all.
[02:08:45.214 --> 02:08:48.777]  They're going to squeeze it out of everybody, and they mean to run you out of business.
[02:08:48.777 --> 02:08:52.519]  It's part of the hostile takeover by the globalists.
[02:08:52.519 --> 02:08:55.641]  Reports out British Special Forces enter Syria to aid rebels.
[02:08:55.641 --> 02:08:59.104]  That's been going on for weeks, but now it's being reported.
[02:08:59.104 --> 02:09:02.326]  Global campaign calls for abolishment of Constitution.
[02:09:02.326 --> 02:09:09.510]  Newsweek, Time Magazine, BBC, Associated Press, Financial Times, CNN, New York Times.
[02:09:09.510 --> 02:09:11.632]  It's just unbelievable treason.
[02:09:11.632 --> 02:09:12.793]  Feds label bulk
[02:09:13.493 --> 02:09:18.056]  Buying of food, a potential terrorist activity, publicly.
[02:09:18.056 --> 02:09:19.797]  Just every activity is evil.
[02:09:19.797 --> 02:09:23.639]  Paul campaign forges ahead with strong Minnesota showing in second place.
[02:09:23.639 --> 02:09:26.220]  And national polls are showing him in second place.
[02:09:26.220 --> 02:09:31.523]  Democrats evicting TSA from airports could cause new 9-11.
[02:09:31.523 --> 02:09:33.565]  That's right, let us take over or terrorists will get you.
[02:09:33.565 --> 02:09:36.206]  It's called terrorism to do that.
[02:09:36.206 --> 02:09:39.488]  That's just some of what we've got there.
[02:09:39.488 --> 02:09:40.649]  But I've been talking about this
[02:09:42.182 --> 02:09:45.764]  Quite a bit throughout the first two hours, but I want to get to it now.
[02:09:45.764 --> 02:09:48.026]  I just want to read the article.
[02:09:48.026 --> 02:09:52.108]  And Kurt's adding at the end of the story just a bunch of examples of this.
[02:09:52.108 --> 02:09:56.811]  He's got some in the article, but I asked him, I said, add a bunch of examples, but there's so many.
[02:09:56.811 --> 02:09:58.552]  I said, just add them.
[02:09:58.552 --> 02:10:01.514]  But here is the report right over here.
[02:10:09.545 --> 02:10:14.248]  Okay, let's go ahead and get into this report now.
[02:10:14.248 --> 02:10:16.490]  This is at Infowars.com.
[02:10:16.490 --> 02:10:21.293]  Globalist campaign calls for abolishment of the Constitution.
[02:10:21.293 --> 02:10:22.754]  And I just want to be clear about this.
[02:10:22.754 --> 02:10:24.516]  You can go look it up for yourself.
[02:10:24.516 --> 02:10:27.158]  I think I'm going to have Kurt add that to the article.
[02:10:27.158 --> 02:10:28.819]  That's the specific thing.
[02:10:28.819 --> 02:10:36.404]  We talked about 30 minutes this morning and he wrote notes about what I wanted in the article and then he ended up writing about a bunch of other stuff because it would be a 20-page article if he put it all in there.
[02:10:39.051 --> 02:10:45.377]  It is treason to work against your country for a foreign power.
[02:10:45.377 --> 02:10:58.649]  It is high treason to be sworn to the Constitution working in the executive, legislative, or judicial, and to work against the country for a private interest, a corporation, or a government, or a criminal enterprise.
[02:10:58.649 --> 02:11:00.631]  That is the definition of high treason.
[02:11:00.631 --> 02:11:01.532]  Well, what's globalism?
[02:11:02.967 --> 02:11:04.468]  Why do you have high treason laws?
[02:11:04.468 --> 02:11:13.911]  Because there's always foreign powers and foreign corporations like the British East India Company, the Dutch East India Company that did take over countries like India.
[02:11:13.911 --> 02:11:21.173]  The British and Dutch East India Companies actually took over India themselves and ran it for several hundred years.
[02:11:23.852 --> 02:11:26.116]  Globalism is nothing new.
[02:11:26.116 --> 02:11:29.743]  It's a form of colonialism through a corporate elite.
[02:11:29.743 --> 02:11:34.531]  And they've learned how to hide themselves, so even if you throw out the government, they're still there.
[02:11:36.004 --> 02:11:45.373]  So they've got CNN hosts, they've got Newsweek, Time Magazine, New York Times, all saying it's bad, it's old, other constitutions are better, the U.N.
[02:11:45.373 --> 02:11:46.814]  Constitution is great.
[02:11:46.814 --> 02:11:47.775]  Really, read the U.N.
[02:11:47.775 --> 02:11:49.437]  Declaration of Rights.
[02:11:49.437 --> 02:11:54.582]  And in Article 29 and 30, they say all these other rights that we say you have, you don't have if the U.N.
[02:11:54.582 --> 02:11:57.324]  says so, or was for the greater good of the U.N.
[02:11:57.324 --> 02:11:58.826]  It's got that fine print.
[02:11:59.827 --> 02:12:03.309]  That we'll do whatever we want, and then look at what the UN does all over the world.
[02:12:03.309 --> 02:12:07.432]  And they say, oh yeah, 51% vote to kill a certain group?
[02:12:07.432 --> 02:12:09.353]  We do it.
[02:12:09.353 --> 02:12:11.494]  In a republic, you can't do that.
[02:12:11.494 --> 02:12:17.678]  In a republic, the majority can't get together like a Nazi Germany and persecute a minority.
[02:12:20.305 --> 02:12:28.132]  And then they argue that, well, you know, we've never really implemented the Constitution fully.
[02:12:28.132 --> 02:12:29.433]  The founders weren't perfect.
[02:12:29.433 --> 02:12:31.595]  It's an idea that you build towards.
[02:12:31.595 --> 02:12:35.278]  And they act like we're having problems because our Constitution isn't good.
[02:12:35.278 --> 02:12:37.881]  Just like they blame capitalism.
[02:12:37.881 --> 02:12:39.082]  Capitalism did this.
[02:12:39.082 --> 02:12:46.949]  It's time to get rid of it, Davos says, and create a new system run by government that the rich control against the middle class.
[02:12:48.544 --> 02:12:51.025]  But again, capitalism didn't do this.
[02:12:51.025 --> 02:12:52.806]  Crony capitalism.
[02:12:52.806 --> 02:12:54.127]  Crony fascism.
[02:12:54.127 --> 02:12:57.168]  Insiders with government.
[02:12:57.168 --> 02:12:59.009]  Shutting down their competition.
[02:12:59.009 --> 02:13:02.050]  Having government sign on to their derivatives fraud.
[02:13:02.050 --> 02:13:03.511]  That's what did this.
[02:13:03.511 --> 02:13:05.172]  It's good old-fashioned crime.
[02:13:07.409 --> 02:13:21.058]  And so when you see Fareed Zarkaia, and however you pronounce that idiot's name, I've met him again at CNN, the Bilderberg guy that looks like a vampire or something, how do you pronounce his name?
[02:13:21.058 --> 02:13:23.600]  Fareed Zarkaia?
[02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:25.601]  I forget, I don't have it in front of me.
[02:13:25.601 --> 02:13:31.886]  The point is, is that I randomly have seen him four or five times bashing the Constitution without even
[02:13:33.413 --> 02:13:34.774]  Hardly ever watching CNN.
[02:13:34.774 --> 02:13:40.216]  I mean, he must be like a parrot or a cuckoo clock that just pops out every day and says the same thing.
[02:13:40.216 --> 02:13:44.978]  This is a globalist who's openly pushing for all of this.
[02:13:44.978 --> 02:13:48.600]  Now, here's the New York Times article.
[02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:52.902]  And it says, we the people loses appeal with people around the world.
[02:13:52.902 --> 02:13:53.142]  Sure.
[02:13:56.013 --> 02:13:59.734]  It is the nation's founding document and sacred text, being sarcastic.
[02:13:59.734 --> 02:14:03.055]  And it's the oldest written national constitution still in force anywhere in the world.
[02:14:03.055 --> 02:14:05.115]  But its influence is waning.
[02:14:05.115 --> 02:14:15.957]  In 87 on the Constitution's Bicentennial, Time Magazine calculated that of the 170 countries that exist today, more than 160 had written charters modestly or indirectly on the U.S.
[02:14:15.957 --> 02:14:16.837]  version.
[02:14:16.837 --> 02:14:19.018]  A quarter century later, the picture looks very different.
[02:14:20.100 --> 02:14:22.022]  And it goes on to bad-mouth it and put it down.
[02:14:22.022 --> 02:14:25.646]  And then you have Ruth Bader Ginsburg yesterday in the news.
[02:14:25.646 --> 02:14:32.413]  You know, headline, Ginsburg tells Egyptian TV, don't model yours after the Constitution.
[02:14:32.413 --> 02:14:35.616]  Remember?
[02:14:35.616 --> 02:14:38.760]  We're always hearing, oh, we're going to launch a war under the authority of the UN.
[02:14:38.760 --> 02:14:39.901]  We don't need the Constitution.
[02:14:39.901 --> 02:14:40.582]  Well, that's illegal.
[02:14:42.492 --> 02:14:44.153]  So they've committed all these crimes.
[02:14:44.153 --> 02:14:47.134]  They're violating the First Amendment in many respects, the Second Amendment.
[02:14:47.134 --> 02:14:49.335]  They're trying to hype police up to go after everything.
[02:14:49.335 --> 02:14:51.015]  They're trying to get the courts to do it.
[02:14:51.015 --> 02:14:58.878]  There's all these movies I'm seeing where they badmouth the Constitution and they save everybody from the nuke or from the terrorists by violating it.
[02:14:58.878 --> 02:15:00.119]  And they're the heroes.
[02:15:00.119 --> 02:15:04.701]  And the movie ends with like, ah, the Constitution's garbage.
[02:15:04.701 --> 02:15:09.343]  Movies like Law Abiding Citizen.
[02:15:09.343 --> 02:15:10.403]  Movies like Source Code.
[02:15:12.779 --> 02:15:18.504]  Again, the movies, the TV, the non-fiction media, all bad-mouthing it.
[02:15:18.504 --> 02:15:19.044]  Why?
[02:15:19.044 --> 02:15:20.625]  Because it's good.
[02:15:20.625 --> 02:15:22.527]  Because it also points out they're criminals.
[02:15:22.527 --> 02:15:26.369]  It's like they're a bunch of vampires telling you how bad the sun is.
[02:15:26.369 --> 02:15:27.710]  Well, of course they're a bunch of vampires.
[02:15:27.710 --> 02:15:30.132]  That's what they are, a bunch of parasites.
[02:15:30.132 --> 02:15:32.274]  A bunch of globalist crony mafias.
[02:15:32.274 --> 02:15:36.757]  It's just, tyranny is just government by mafia, government by criminal.
[02:15:36.757 --> 02:15:37.838]  It's very simple.
[02:15:41.598 --> 02:15:43.679]  People will kill for a hundred dollars.
[02:15:43.679 --> 02:15:47.922]  Will they do even more to get the total control system?
[02:15:47.922 --> 02:15:56.608]  And have all the private jets and government jets and trillions of dollars and nuclear weapons and power and surveillance systems and the power trips they get?
[02:15:56.608 --> 02:15:58.750]  And what says they can't do that?
[02:15:58.750 --> 02:16:01.331]  Constitution, Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence.
[02:16:01.331 --> 02:16:10.538]  And so they ignore all that while attacking it because at any time you read the Constitution it says what they're doing is high treason, punishable by
[02:16:12.383 --> 02:16:15.384]  Being hung by the neck until dead.
[02:16:15.384 --> 02:16:17.385]  So of course a bunch of criminals.
[02:16:17.385 --> 02:16:23.626]  It'd be like bank robbers saying, we don't like anti-bank robbery laws.
[02:16:23.626 --> 02:16:27.568]  I mean, it's very simple.
[02:16:27.568 --> 02:16:33.289]  And there's a culture now, I see cases all the time where a federal or state judge says, don't bring Constitution in court.
[02:16:33.289 --> 02:16:35.850]  They're going purely to administrative.
[02:16:35.850 --> 02:16:38.591]  We the people loses appeal with people around the world.
[02:16:40.046 --> 02:16:50.612]  And it's got weird stuff saying at the article end, seriously, you gotta read this, saying the Soviet Republic's had a better system than we did.
[02:16:50.612 --> 02:16:55.655]  Go read it, I mean, you cannot make this up.
[02:16:55.655 --> 02:17:00.638]  And like Kurt Nimmo this morning is going, this is a serious article, they're saying the Soviet Union was good?
[02:17:00.638 --> 02:17:06.042]  I don't understand, and I'm like, it's all meant to be in our face.
[02:17:06.042 --> 02:17:07.783]  Soviet good, America bad.
[02:17:11.601 --> 02:17:14.322]  And you're like, but it's not a satire article.
[02:17:14.322 --> 02:17:15.862]  No!
[02:17:15.862 --> 02:17:17.543]  No!
[02:17:17.543 --> 02:17:19.083]  No!
[02:17:19.083 --> 02:17:19.503]  It's not!
[02:17:19.503 --> 02:17:25.405]  It's all about throwing it in our face.
[02:17:25.405 --> 02:17:27.606]  The Constitution says you gotta follow the state law.
[02:17:27.606 --> 02:17:32.808]  How are they indicting parents for kids being late and saying it's truancy when the code says it isn't?
[02:17:32.808 --> 02:17:35.769]  Because they're crooks!
[02:17:35.769 --> 02:17:36.889]  They've got a force.
[02:17:39.994 --> 02:17:51.221]  They've got an armed force claiming it's legitimate, it's illegitimate under all common law, under common sense.
[02:17:51.221 --> 02:17:57.144]  The Union of Soviet Republics was much better than ours, he added, adding, we guaranteed freedom of speech of the press.
[02:17:57.144 --> 02:18:05.269]  Big deal, they guaranteed freedom of speech of the press, of street demonstrations and protests, and anyone who was caught trying to suppress criticism of the government will be called to account.
[02:18:09.847 --> 02:18:11.909]  And yuppies read this and go, oh, Soviet Union.
[02:18:11.909 --> 02:18:15.633]  I mean, we're in cuckoo land here.
[02:18:15.633 --> 02:18:17.835]  Well, yeah, we abort babies for convenience.
[02:18:17.835 --> 02:18:20.117]  The police wear black uniforms, never a good sign.
[02:18:20.117 --> 02:18:23.901]  There's cameras everywhere.
[02:18:23.901 --> 02:18:27.224]  The government says they'll secretly arrest us and have us disappear into a black hole.
[02:18:27.224 --> 02:18:30.548]  Of course they're going to have the New York Times talking about how great the Soviets are.
[02:18:33.900 --> 02:18:38.364]  And again, I'm the bad man because I want our Constitution.
[02:18:38.364 --> 02:18:40.146]  We're the extremists!
[02:18:40.146 --> 02:18:44.811]  The actual FBI training reports say those that make frequent references to the U.S.
[02:18:44.811 --> 02:18:48.915]  Constitution call FBI immediately!
[02:18:48.915 --> 02:18:50.696]  That's a quote!
[02:18:50.696 --> 02:18:54.140]  Just type in FBI flyer, constitutional terrorist, you'll get news articles about it.
[02:18:54.844 --> 02:18:56.065]  With a straight face.
[02:18:56.065 --> 02:18:58.226]  I've got the training videos.
[02:18:58.226 --> 02:19:00.748]  So, I mean, these are criminals, folks.
[02:19:00.748 --> 02:19:09.493]  And they're trying to get the local cops and the low-level FBI and military to go, okay, we're allowed to kill people now and arrest them for no reason.
[02:19:09.493 --> 02:19:12.796]  Okay, we're allowed to, there's no constitution, torture's good.
[02:19:12.796 --> 02:19:15.557]  And then the government does it and they go, oh, this is the new way?
[02:19:15.557 --> 02:19:17.639]  And they're like, yeah, we all ridicule it.
[02:19:17.639 --> 02:19:19.660]  And they're just getting everybody to ridicule it.
[02:19:19.660 --> 02:19:24.143]  So people in government go, I guess we, I guess it is bad.
[02:19:26.897 --> 02:19:29.761]  See how they do that?
[02:19:29.761 --> 02:19:32.665]  Kurt Nemo's article is so important.
[02:19:32.665 --> 02:19:34.768]  Get it out to everybody.
[02:19:34.768 --> 02:19:40.377]  Globalist campaign calls for abolishment of Constitution.
[02:19:41.792 --> 02:19:48.257]  And I'm going to finish up with this, then have a guest on for about 10-15 minutes, then I will finish with all those that are holding.
[02:19:48.257 --> 02:19:58.103]  But Kurt has added at the bottom of the article a bunch of links to where they're attacking the Constitution and just absolutely demonizing the living daylights out of it.
[02:19:58.103 --> 02:19:58.724]  We'll be right back.

[02:22:54.962 --> 02:22:56.703]  Again, that's 123survivalplan.com.
[02:23:01.721 --> 02:23:05.402]  Has the United States been discovered in the Bible?
[02:23:05.402 --> 02:23:07.902]  Where does Islam fit in Bible prophecy?
[02:23:07.902 --> 02:23:11.063]  Is the New World Order world government?
[02:23:11.063 --> 02:23:19.145]  These and other crucial end time questions are answered in the new DVD package, Understanding the End Time, from End Time Ministries.
[02:23:19.145 --> 02:23:27.147]  Jesus Christ said, I tell you these things before they come to pass, so that when they do come to pass, you might believe.
[02:23:27.147 --> 02:23:31.228]  After you watch this 14 lesson DVD series, Understanding the End Time,
[02:23:31.488 --> 02:23:31.908]  You're welcome.
[02:24:09.722 --> 02:24:20.553]  See, all these other constitutions worldwide say you've got all these rights unless the government says so, and you get your rights from government.
[02:24:20.553 --> 02:24:23.916]  And so government can change at any time it wants.
[02:24:23.916 --> 02:24:29.422]  The Declaration of Independence, Constitution, and Bill of Rights all come out of the Magna Carta 1215.
[02:24:31.417 --> 02:24:38.123]  It also gets into the whole Parliament Wars, I don't know, 1243 or so.
[02:24:38.123 --> 02:24:39.844]  Check my memory.
[02:24:39.844 --> 02:24:48.652]  Look up the Oliver Cromwell, when he won the war, was it 43, 45, 1643, 1645, something like that.
[02:24:55.131 --> 02:24:58.674]  All of this comes out of people saying kings are not God.
[02:24:58.674 --> 02:25:00.515]  We have basic rights to private property.
[02:25:00.515 --> 02:25:05.339]  I mean, local lords would have sex with your daughter if they wanted to.
[02:25:05.339 --> 02:25:07.641]  You are an animal.
[02:25:07.641 --> 02:25:09.543]  And it was feudal law in Japan.
[02:25:09.543 --> 02:25:13.506]  It was feudal law in what's Mexico today under the Aztecs.
[02:25:13.506 --> 02:25:18.610]  It was feudal law everywhere in the world.
[02:25:18.610 --> 02:25:20.331]  Except for some of the northern
[02:25:22.062 --> 02:25:28.807]  North American tribes, Iroquois and others had similar stuff to British common law that had been developed.
[02:25:28.807 --> 02:25:36.634]  And actually some of the Iroquois Confederacy rules, and Benjamin Franklin, I used to hear this, I went and looked it up, actually part of our constitution does come out of some Native American law.
[02:25:36.634 --> 02:25:40.397]  So there were some cultures that had it where everybody actually voted.
[02:25:40.397 --> 02:25:42.398]  And where there were rules.
[02:25:42.398 --> 02:25:48.103]  And where you couldn't just have the tribe vote to kill somebody for no reason or whatever.
[02:25:48.103 --> 02:25:48.984]  Or take their property.
[02:25:50.885 --> 02:25:54.149]  And a lot of cultures develop common laws that are pretty darn fair.
[02:25:54.149 --> 02:25:57.232]  So, the common law was fought for.
[02:25:57.232 --> 02:26:00.315]  Kings were beheaded.
[02:26:00.315 --> 02:26:04.280]  Repeatedly.
[02:26:04.280 --> 02:26:07.703]  What, a few years after 1215, the king went back on what he said he was going to do.
[02:26:07.703 --> 02:26:10.026]  They got him and killed him.
[02:26:10.026 --> 02:26:11.407]  Cromwell, you know, the king...
[02:26:12.725 --> 02:26:13.785]  Tried to usurp power.
[02:26:13.785 --> 02:26:15.446]  You know what happened to him.
[02:26:15.446 --> 02:26:18.347]  These examples happened over and over again.
[02:26:18.347 --> 02:26:20.008]  And that's why the system hates it.
[02:26:20.008 --> 02:26:26.410]  And Kurt hits the nail on the head in his article of why the media run by globalists.
[02:26:26.410 --> 02:26:27.290]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[02:26:27.290 --> 02:26:29.131]  When you see Time Magazine Newsweek
[02:26:30.029 --> 02:26:34.231]  The History Channel saying, is the Declaration of Independence illegal and bad-mouthing it?
[02:26:34.231 --> 02:26:37.232]  I mean, you're looking at outrageous sedition.
[02:26:37.232 --> 02:26:43.954]  As a citizen, I can say, the government's been destructive of my rights, I'm gonna abolish the government.
[02:26:43.954 --> 02:26:49.116]  But, that's to reinstate the Constitution, Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence.
[02:26:49.116 --> 02:26:53.338]  And yes, the states can get together and change it when they want, we the people.
[02:26:53.338 --> 02:26:57.260]  But when you're working for the UN, foreign corporations, foreign powers, coming in,
[02:26:58.570 --> 02:27:03.955]  And saying, get rid of it, that is an act of espionage, of the highest order.
[02:27:03.955 --> 02:27:12.082]  It is sedition, it is high treason, it is an attempted overthrow.
[02:27:12.082 --> 02:27:15.665]  But now these criminals just do it out in the open, but they know how big a deal it is.
[02:27:15.665 --> 02:27:21.410]  I remember I watched it live on C-SPAN three years ago, it's in Fall of the Republic, two and a half years ago.
[02:27:22.644 --> 02:27:26.625]  When Obama became the head of the U.N.
[02:27:26.625 --> 02:27:27.366]  Security Council.
[02:27:27.366 --> 02:27:31.307]  First time a sitting president or anybody in the cabinet had ever done that.
[02:27:31.307 --> 02:27:33.607]  And Henry Kissinger was there, George Shultz.
[02:27:33.607 --> 02:27:34.588]  They were gasping.
[02:27:34.588 --> 02:27:37.429]  Some of them had tears coming out because they believe in global government.
[02:27:37.429 --> 02:27:39.069]  I mean, these are sickos.
[02:27:39.069 --> 02:27:51.213]  And the treason was so huge and so blasphemous, everyone was in awe that the president was violating his oath completely publicly, rubbing our faces in it, sitting
[02:27:52.654 --> 02:27:58.958]  Over a foreign global corporate power with its own military.
[02:27:58.958 --> 02:28:05.221]  And saying he turns his office over to it.
[02:28:05.221 --> 02:28:13.066]  I mean, could President Obama or Reagan say, I'm going to now say that I'm under the Chinese government and I get my authority?
[02:28:14.335 --> 02:28:17.959]  To bomb Libya because the Chinese government said I could?
[02:28:17.959 --> 02:28:28.469]  That's exactly, listen to me, this is big, that's exactly what he did when he said, I got my authority to attack Libya, but it's not an attack, to help Libya, from the UN.
[02:28:28.469 --> 02:28:35.116]  And Congress said, well we're warmongers, we're all paid for by the same groups, we'd like to give you the authorization, but you gotta get it from us, and Obama said,
[02:28:35.416 --> 02:28:36.877]  I don't get nothing from you.
[02:28:36.877 --> 02:28:39.920]  I get my declaration from the UN.
[02:28:39.920 --> 02:28:44.103]  And I'm sending this letter out that I did this for the UN, for their credibility.
[02:28:44.103 --> 02:28:45.524]  They got credibility.
[02:28:45.524 --> 02:28:47.866]  They gave me the power, not you.
[02:28:47.866 --> 02:28:53.271]  And four current Supreme Court justices have shot their mouths off in the last year saying the same thing.
[02:28:53.271 --> 02:28:56.573]  And before that, always at least four.
[02:28:56.573 --> 02:28:57.854]  Since I've been in the newsroom.
[02:28:59.355 --> 02:29:00.096]  17 years.
[02:29:00.096 --> 02:29:05.859]  It comes across my desk every few months with a Supreme Court justice saying, get rid of the Bill of Rights, the Constitution.
[02:29:05.859 --> 02:29:08.100]  We should rule according to the UN.
[02:29:08.100 --> 02:29:14.423]  I mean, they should be arrested immediately.
[02:29:14.423 --> 02:29:20.967]  The Congress should move to impeach them, to remove them in that civil trial.
[02:29:22.307 --> 02:29:30.550]  And then issue a congressional indictment, and they should be tried by a federal grand jury should bill them, and that's the end of it.
[02:29:30.550 --> 02:29:32.051]  I mean, that's what you do!
[02:29:32.051 --> 02:29:36.892]  Oh, you're in the Supreme Court, you're saying you don't follow our law, you work for a foreign power?
[02:29:36.892 --> 02:29:39.493]  Handcuffs!
[02:29:39.493 --> 02:29:43.054]  But see, before it's like, we don't want to get rid of the Constitution, don't be a conspiracy theorist.
[02:29:43.054 --> 02:29:44.455]  Oh no, we're not violating it.
[02:29:44.455 --> 02:29:45.956]  Now it's like, get rid of it!
[02:29:45.956 --> 02:29:48.116]  We're gonna secretly arrest you and take your guns!
[02:29:48.116 --> 02:29:49.077]  It's trendy!
[02:29:49.077 --> 02:29:49.657]  It's trendy!
[02:29:50.543 --> 02:29:54.466]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.466 --> 02:29:57.148]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.184 --> 02:30:08.407]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, I was still starving.
[02:30:08.407 --> 02:30:26.296]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:30:26.296 --> 02:30:30.398]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[02:30:30.678 --> 02:30:32.459]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[02:30:32.459 --> 02:30:40.605]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[02:30:40.605 --> 02:30:46.929]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[02:30:46.929 --> 02:30:48.210]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:30:48.210 --> 02:30:49.090]  It's incredible.
[02:30:49.090 --> 02:30:58.297]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[02:30:58.297 --> 02:31:00.138]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[02:31:00.878 --> 02:31:05.421]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:05.421 --> 02:31:06.342]  Number one.
[02:31:06.342 --> 02:31:09.764]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.764 --> 02:31:10.625]  Number two.
[02:31:10.625 --> 02:31:15.508]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:15.508 --> 02:31:16.269]  It's true.
[02:31:16.269 --> 02:31:20.812]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:21.132 --> 02:31:21.953]  Number 3.
[02:31:21.953 --> 02:31:25.536]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.536 --> 02:31:29.460]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:29.460 --> 02:31:30.241]  Number 4.
[02:31:30.241 --> 02:31:33.024]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:33.024 --> 02:31:36.347]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.687 --> 02:31:41.608]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.608 --> 02:31:46.669]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:46.669 --> 02:31:50.850]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:50.850 --> 02:31:52.630]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:32:01.806 --> 02:32:03.507]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:32:03.507 --> 02:32:08.829]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:32:08.829 --> 02:32:10.369]  Saving means to make money.
[02:32:10.369 --> 02:32:19.153]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:32:19.893 --> 02:32:27.415]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:32:27.415 --> 02:32:35.417]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:32:35.417 --> 02:32:40.639]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[02:32:51.049 --> 02:32:53.313]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[02:33:31.209 --> 02:33:39.202]  Look at this article here out of the New York Times knocking the Constitution saying basically nobody wants it worldwide, get rid of it.
[02:33:39.202 --> 02:33:40.964]  They say it's not cool, it's not...
[02:33:42.921 --> 02:33:50.885]  It's fashionable to get rid of the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:33:50.885 --> 02:33:58.649]  And we have history channels saying, you know, that the Declaration of Independence might be illegal, saying we have a right to revolt against the government.
[02:33:58.649 --> 02:34:01.811]  I mean, this is outrageous that your rights come from God.
[02:34:01.811 --> 02:34:03.732]  What about separation of church and state?
[02:34:03.732 --> 02:34:05.753]  That's not even in the government.
[02:34:05.753 --> 02:34:08.955]  The First Amendment says Congress shall make no law
[02:34:11.710 --> 02:34:16.412]  Restricting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[02:34:16.412 --> 02:34:20.153]  The federal government has no jurisdiction in religion.
[02:34:20.153 --> 02:34:23.474]  Not that religion can't be involved in life.
[02:34:23.474 --> 02:34:26.275]  It means you can't have one state-sponsored church.
[02:34:26.275 --> 02:34:35.138]  Protestant, Catholic, Hindu, Shiite, Muslim, whatever it is.
[02:34:35.138 --> 02:34:37.339]  It's very, very simple.
[02:34:37.339 --> 02:34:39.720]  And now Barack Obama's saying you're going to put
[02:34:40.700 --> 02:34:46.008]  This is actually in the Washington Post, day after pill, vending machines in Catholic churches.
[02:34:46.008 --> 02:34:49.894]  And they're going, but that violates our religion.
[02:34:49.894 --> 02:34:52.959]  Separation of church and state, the White House has quoted.
[02:34:52.959 --> 02:34:55.142]  Separation of church and state?
[02:34:57.102 --> 02:35:05.231]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[02:35:05.231 --> 02:35:13.181]  Then it goes into, or the press, or the people to assemble and petition the government for a redress of grievance.
[02:35:13.181 --> 02:35:15.664]  People used to come into the Parliament
[02:35:16.613 --> 02:35:25.155]  And throw down letters of demand and be heard by the Parliament before you could charge somebody with a capital crime of treason.
[02:35:25.155 --> 02:35:26.595]  You had to go before the Parliament.
[02:35:26.595 --> 02:35:28.775]  There were wars fought over this.
[02:35:28.775 --> 02:35:32.776]  Kings had their heads chopped off over and over again for violating this.
[02:35:32.776 --> 02:35:36.357]  People act like there was a war between Americans and the colonies and the Brits.
[02:35:36.357 --> 02:35:38.577]  The Americans were Englishmen.
[02:35:38.577 --> 02:35:42.598]  They were fighting a war that had already been fought in England over and over again!
[02:35:42.598 --> 02:35:43.778]  I'm sorry, I know I'm ranting.
[02:35:45.287 --> 02:35:46.468]  Makes me want to throw up.
[02:35:46.468 --> 02:35:49.152]  The article's up at Infowars.com.
[02:35:49.152 --> 02:35:52.055]  Globalist campaign calls for abolishment of Constitution.
[02:35:52.055 --> 02:35:54.918]  You know, we called this guy yesterday to try to get him on.
[02:35:54.918 --> 02:35:56.340]  Really nice fellow.
[02:35:56.340 --> 02:35:57.822]  And he's like, he's a lawyer.
[02:35:57.822 --> 02:36:04.290]  He goes, I want Alex, he told the producer, before I come on, because I've been on other shows and they attack me, I want him to read the law.
[02:36:05.526 --> 02:36:08.987]  Because there's no law that I even violated in the truancy.
[02:36:08.987 --> 02:36:11.789]  I'm the parent, plus it wasn't even enough days.
[02:36:11.789 --> 02:36:14.750]  You can't, and of course I went and read the Virginia statute.
[02:36:14.750 --> 02:36:16.110]  He's right.
[02:36:16.110 --> 02:36:25.394]  And he's like, how are they bringing us into court, setting the court date, all this, you know, indicting us basically for this when it's not a law.
[02:36:25.394 --> 02:36:27.635]  Welcome to family court.
[02:36:27.635 --> 02:36:29.036]  Welcome to the kangaroo courts.
[02:36:29.036 --> 02:36:30.616]  Look how they were set up.
[02:36:30.616 --> 02:36:32.137]  They're only a hundred or so years old.
[02:36:32.998 --> 02:36:34.958]  And I was telling that during the break, and he was like, really, really?
[02:36:34.958 --> 02:36:36.359]  And he's a lawyer.
[02:36:36.359 --> 02:36:39.699]  Because they don't teach this stuff in law school.
[02:36:39.699 --> 02:36:43.360]  You know, all the constitutional lawyers I've had on, Ron Paul, they know.
[02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:46.681]  And when you get to the core of eugenics, that's what all this comes out of.
[02:36:46.681 --> 02:36:49.681]  So, it doesn't matter if there's not a law.
[02:36:49.681 --> 02:37:01.964]  Because they're going to operate as if, oh well, then this shows some type of bad parenting, then there could try to be a ruling, I'm not saying they're going this direction, that you're endangering the child.
[02:37:03.368 --> 02:37:08.835]  It's the welfare, and they twist that welfare clause in the Constitution into that.
[02:37:08.835 --> 02:37:09.636]  But really, they're just...
[02:37:10.762 --> 02:37:12.583]  Family Hygiene Courts.
[02:37:12.583 --> 02:37:13.343]  That's what they were set up for.
[02:37:13.343 --> 02:37:14.143]  The Health Department.
[02:37:14.143 --> 02:37:14.543]  All of it.
[02:37:14.543 --> 02:37:15.304]  Eugenics.
[02:37:15.304 --> 02:37:16.004]  Here's the headline.
[02:37:16.004 --> 02:37:17.064]  We're going to our guest.
[02:37:17.064 --> 02:37:22.226]  Judge sets trial date in school tardiness case.
[02:37:22.226 --> 02:37:28.828]  And he sent me, being late to class that they combine and call truancy, he sent me the Virginia Code.
[02:37:28.828 --> 02:37:29.668]  And I've read it.
[02:37:29.668 --> 02:37:30.309]  Scanned over it.
[02:37:30.309 --> 02:37:30.989]  22.1-254.
[02:37:30.989 --> 02:37:31.509]  Virginia State.
[02:37:31.509 --> 02:37:32.889]  And they are going ahead.
[02:37:39.295 --> 02:37:47.258]  They are charged under the state's compulsory education law, which says parents have to send their kids to school for the same number of days and hours per day as school in session.
[02:37:47.258 --> 02:37:48.238]  That's taken out of context.
[02:37:48.238 --> 02:37:49.679]  You've got to read the full document.
[02:37:49.679 --> 02:37:51.900]  And he joins us now.
[02:37:51.900 --> 02:38:02.924]  Another statute clearly spells out how school systems must proceed in the case of chronic absences when there is no indication that the people's parent is aware and supports the people's absence.
[02:38:02.924 --> 02:38:05.185]  Neither statute specifically addresses tardiness.
[02:38:06.172 --> 02:38:06.952]  That's right.
[02:38:06.952 --> 02:38:15.114]  But I've seen him, and we're going to our guest, with the student absence assistance program, ASAP.
[02:38:15.114 --> 02:38:17.115]  This was all over the news at the time, like 12 years ago.
[02:38:17.115 --> 02:38:23.177]  Lost Tonight saw it, listening on 90.1 or KLBJ on 590.
[02:38:23.177 --> 02:38:27.358]  If you go back, then parents were calling.
[02:38:27.358 --> 02:38:30.198]  It happened to my cameraman, Mike Hanson.
[02:38:30.198 --> 02:38:31.379]  His son had the flu.
[02:38:32.759 --> 02:38:38.672]  13 years old, Mike's at work working for me, and the police are at his house.
[02:38:38.672 --> 02:38:42.580]  His son's 13 and home, his wife worked for the county, she can't come home.
[02:38:43.866 --> 02:38:46.788]  It was actually the county that sent him out, the same office.
[02:38:46.788 --> 02:38:47.969]  She worked in planning.
[02:38:47.969 --> 02:38:48.969]  They can't go home.
[02:38:48.969 --> 02:38:51.871]  He has to leave my office and go there, and there's constables there.
[02:38:51.871 --> 02:38:56.974]  And they're going, well, it doesn't matter if you even called.
[02:38:56.974 --> 02:39:04.359]  This is the third time he's been sick in this semester, and we're just here to give you this summons.
[02:39:04.359 --> 02:39:06.380]  And then we found out it was people that were late to class.
[02:39:06.380 --> 02:39:10.403]  They'd combine three, call them into a courtroom, and on the news it was a portable building.
[02:39:12.708 --> 02:39:19.997]  Call them into a courtroom, in a portal building, Judge Jean Muir on local CBS, and she'd say, sign this document or you're going to juvie right now.
[02:39:19.997 --> 02:39:22.240]  And the parents would shake and sign it.
[02:39:22.240 --> 02:39:24.242]  Well, they hadn't done anything.
[02:39:24.242 --> 02:39:30.831]  They were having them sign on to basically probation, a further justification that if any other problems, now she had them.
[02:39:30.831 --> 02:39:31.512]  Through fraud!
[02:39:32.537 --> 02:39:34.639]  Just like there's no law to take vaccines and they lie.
[02:39:34.639 --> 02:39:35.559]  Okay, enough of me ranting.
[02:39:35.559 --> 02:39:39.062]  I wanted to set the table with some of that and give him the floor to break this down.
[02:39:39.062 --> 02:39:52.212]  But judge sets trial date in a school tardiness case, Washington Post, and joining us is Mark Dinekorb, lawyer, full-blown trial, and I've got the tardiness list here.
[02:39:52.212 --> 02:39:54.734]  It's late to class.
[02:39:54.734 --> 02:39:58.197]  I mean, my goodness, my children are homeschooled, but twice a week they go to a
[02:39:58.917 --> 02:40:00.178]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:40:00.178 --> 02:40:07.641]  Well, my issue is somewhat more narrow than that, but I agree with some of the things that you said.
[02:40:26.542 --> 02:40:35.968]  Well, tell us about your case here, because now, you know, murderers and people, they've got to wait to have their trial, because you're having a trial over your daughter being late to class.
[02:40:35.968 --> 02:40:44.534]  Well, I have three elementary school kids that go to elementary school in Loudoun County, Virginia.
[02:40:44.534 --> 02:40:55.762]  And this past Monday, we were summoned, my wife and I were summoned to appear in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court in Loudoun County.
[02:40:56.383 --> 02:41:09.988]  To respond to misdemeanor charges, Class 3 misdemeanor charges, because our kids, they say, were excessively tardy to school.
[02:41:09.988 --> 02:41:14.490]  So, those kind of charges, the maximum fine is $500 per child per defendant.
[02:41:14.490 --> 02:41:18.011]  So, we are facing a $3,000 maximum fine if we're convicted of this supposed crime.
[02:41:25.973 --> 02:41:37.602]  And what they do here in Texas is they combine the tardies and then say that they're a truancy and the code, they had to stop doing it, at least when we were exposing it, for a while because it did come out it was illegal.
[02:41:37.602 --> 02:41:40.124]  And obviously this is a revenue generating system.
[02:41:40.124 --> 02:41:51.273]  I've got their letters to you, I've got the summons, I've got the code here for people watching on the internet, not just listening, but go over now why you're clearly saying that the law doesn't even apply here.
[02:41:53.379 --> 02:42:04.104]  Yeah, well, I mean, you know, first of all, with regard to the tardies, I just wanted to touch on that.
[02:42:04.104 --> 02:42:12.528]  My wife and I are admittedly not perfect, and our children aren't perfect, and we are trying to do our best to comply with the school's desires.
[02:42:12.528 --> 02:42:14.829]  To get them into the government training prison.
[02:42:14.829 --> 02:42:18.011]  I understand that, but I mean, again, these are your children.
[02:42:18.011 --> 02:42:18.631]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:42:19.249 --> 02:42:26.876]  Well, I understand that, but I do appreciate the fact that the school has a train.
[02:42:26.876 --> 02:42:35.604]  It's trying to send out of the train station, so it wants everybody in the train station so they can commence brainwashing.
[02:42:38.689 --> 02:42:47.111]  We're trying our best to comply, but we are admittedly imperfect, and we've had some difficulties.
[02:42:47.111 --> 02:42:58.415]  But as you see from the information I sent you, in the majority of these cases, or in a third of the cases, the amount of tardiness is less than one minute.
[02:42:58.415 --> 02:43:04.336]  And in all of the cases, with the exception of two, the tardiness is less than five minutes.
[02:43:04.336 --> 02:43:06.677]  So it's a very de minimis problem.
[02:43:07.638 --> 02:43:32.947]  Um, but I just wanted to touch on that because there are a lot of people that have given me a lot of advice lately about why can't you just get up 10 minutes early and I, and uh, if any, most people that have children recognize that, uh... Some mornings they refuse to put the shoes on, some mornings the car doesn't start, some mornings there's an 18-wheeler turned over on the road.
[02:43:32.947 --> 02:43:35.368]  Yeah, and all of those, all of those things
[02:43:36.440 --> 02:43:38.641]  I tend to agree with you on that point because
[02:44:05.618 --> 02:44:17.546]  We do feel like the school has an attitude that when we drop off our kids at school, that when they step over that threshold, that they're no longer our kids, and we don't share that view.
[02:44:17.546 --> 02:44:25.551]  We think they're our kids for the entire day, no matter where they are, and that we're ultimately the parents and ultimately responsible for them.
[02:44:27.186 --> 02:44:30.327]  Well, you can pull your children out of the school if you want.
[02:44:30.327 --> 02:44:33.808]  So the point is, they're not truant when you've got them out.
[02:44:33.808 --> 02:44:41.311]  But as you point out in the news, and even the Washington Post has to admit, the code is saying tardiness is not truancy.
[02:44:41.311 --> 02:44:42.872]  Well, that's right.
[02:44:42.872 --> 02:44:44.792]  The Virginia Code is pretty clear.
[02:44:44.792 --> 02:44:52.695]  What they're trying to do in the Virginia Code is address truancy and absences, and absences without the parent's knowledge.
[02:44:53.624 --> 02:45:02.567]  And there's a process when a child is absent from school, not tardy, but not reporting to school at all.
[02:45:02.567 --> 02:45:12.911]  If they're absent from school a number of days, then certain things start to happen, and then the school can start to get involved, and eventually they can get the courts involved.
[02:45:14.660 --> 02:45:22.283]  I can see, you know, an extreme case where that might be, you know, where the courts may need to get involved.
[02:45:22.283 --> 02:45:26.185]  But certainly, in our situation, that's not the case.
[02:45:26.185 --> 02:45:32.307]  You can't find anywhere in the Virginia statutes where they talk about tardy or late.
[02:45:32.307 --> 02:45:41.751]  And what the school system is doing here is they're trying to, you know, cobble together something to
[02:45:43.303 --> 02:45:49.529]  Uh, intimidate parents or bully parents into complying with their tardiness policy.
[02:45:49.529 --> 02:45:51.190]  Well, I mean, let's just stop right there.
[02:45:51.190 --> 02:45:55.655]  It's a policy that they want them to take shots, not the law, but they lie to you and tell you it is.
[02:45:55.655 --> 02:46:00.219]  Then they'll kick your child out for not having shots and then charge you with a truancy.
[02:46:00.219 --> 02:46:01.660]  They do that fraud too.
[02:46:01.660 --> 02:46:03.502]  They're involved in fraud.
[02:46:03.502 --> 02:46:05.824]  The court is involved in fraud.
[02:46:05.824 --> 02:46:07.505]  This is judicial tyranny.
[02:46:08.553 --> 02:46:14.117]  And here you are, like every other good American, apologizing about yourself all day.
[02:46:14.117 --> 02:46:16.918]  How about we don't trust the government like George Washington said?
[02:46:16.918 --> 02:46:19.120]  How about we start getting disgusted with them?
[02:46:19.120 --> 02:46:22.702]  How about some of them go to jail for falsely charging you?
[02:46:22.702 --> 02:46:25.103]  There's all sorts of criminal things involved here.
[02:46:25.103 --> 02:46:27.125]  I know they're the watchers.
[02:46:27.125 --> 02:46:28.726]  Who watches the watchers?
[02:46:28.726 --> 02:46:32.348]  But, you know, the last people we need telling us how to run our lives is the government.
[02:46:33.211 --> 02:46:43.420]  Well, I just don't want people to think that I'm thumbing my nose at the teachers that want to have, you know, a productive class and one that's not disruptive.
[02:46:43.420 --> 02:46:45.102]  And push Prozac and Ritalin on the kids.
[02:46:45.102 --> 02:46:46.343]  No, I understand.
[02:46:46.343 --> 02:46:49.566]  Have you heard how they arrest five-year-olds for running in the playground?
[02:46:49.566 --> 02:46:58.574]  Does the playground at your little public prison, I mean, indoctrination center, do they let your children jog at the playground?
[02:46:58.574 --> 02:46:59.275]  Yes, I believe they do.
[02:47:00.214 --> 02:47:03.156]  Oh, so you're allowed to walk in the yard, okay.
[02:47:03.156 --> 02:47:06.397]  So it's not a supermax, it's okay, got it.
[02:47:06.397 --> 02:47:09.099]  They are prisoners, they mean them to be prisoners.
[02:47:09.099 --> 02:47:12.581]  And your little daughter, I bet she's glad that you guys are going to court now.
[02:47:12.581 --> 02:47:25.248]  I mean, I guess now if she didn't get her shoes on quick enough, or pipes burst, or whatever's keeping you from being late to the government training camp, the re-education center, that you should tell her, Mommy and Daddy, you're going to prison if you don't hurry.
[02:47:26.161 --> 02:47:29.964]  Well, it is creating a lot of stress in the family.
[02:47:29.964 --> 02:47:34.989]  It's creating stress for the kids, and it's creating stress for my wife.
[02:47:34.989 --> 02:47:36.751]  Well, they're just being taught how to go to jail.
[02:47:36.751 --> 02:47:38.652]  I mean, we have the biggest prison population in the world.
[02:47:38.652 --> 02:47:39.994]  They're being prepped for that.
[02:47:39.994 --> 02:47:43.096]  That's what the TSA is all about, prepping us to have our rights violated.
[02:47:43.096 --> 02:47:46.219]  But, sir, specifically, what are you going to do?
[02:47:46.219 --> 02:47:49.082]  I mean, you've been... Tell us where you are in the case.
[02:47:49.082 --> 02:47:51.244]  I mean, it's going forward now, even though it's not in the law.
[02:47:53.163 --> 02:47:53.783]  That's right.
[02:47:53.783 --> 02:47:57.046]  Well, we had our arraignment on Monday.
[02:47:57.046 --> 02:47:59.707]  My wife and I were arraigned and charged.
[02:47:59.707 --> 02:48:04.130]  And now they've set a trial date for March 14th.
[02:48:04.130 --> 02:48:08.413]  So we have to... And you're charged with truancy?
[02:48:08.413 --> 02:48:13.916]  Well, we're charged with a Class 3 misdemeanor.
[02:48:13.916 --> 02:48:14.997]  I have the paperwork here.
[02:48:16.308 --> 02:48:20.571]  Well, you know, don't play bargain and get the jury up there and show them that the law doesn't say that.
[02:48:20.571 --> 02:48:23.653]  Now, the judge may try to stop you from actually reading the law.
[02:48:23.653 --> 02:48:24.534]  You know, they do that a lot.
[02:48:24.534 --> 02:48:27.096]  They're like, whoa, we don't... Laws aren't here.
[02:48:27.096 --> 02:48:29.858]  It's about my black robes and robbing people.
[02:48:29.858 --> 02:48:30.798]  Well, I don't know.
[02:48:30.798 --> 02:48:34.621]  I hope we get a fair shake in this court.
[02:48:34.621 --> 02:48:38.364]  But we were charged against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth of Virginia.
[02:48:39.156 --> 02:48:43.298]  Yeah, so you're involved in a disorderly insurrection.
[02:48:43.298 --> 02:48:45.679]  They're just saying you're a disreputable scum.
[02:48:45.679 --> 02:48:50.361]  And of course, that's the wider thing they would use, yes.
[02:48:50.361 --> 02:48:59.986]  So, we plan on moving to dismiss on the grounds that there is no law against dropping off your kids late to school.
[02:49:00.851 --> 02:49:03.472]  And I hope we prevail on that point.
[02:49:03.472 --> 02:49:05.273]  But I mean, what about the prosecutor?
[02:49:05.273 --> 02:49:10.055]  I mean, have you talked to this dimwit and explained that, hey, why are you doing this?
[02:49:10.055 --> 02:49:11.735]  They haven't assigned a prosecutor yet.
[02:49:11.735 --> 02:49:17.738]  But I'm hopeful that when they do assign one that I can talk to them and hopefully talk some sense into them.
[02:49:17.738 --> 02:49:21.039]  Yeah, but just so you know, I don't know about Virginia, but I look at most states.
[02:49:21.039 --> 02:49:22.360]  They're doing this everywhere, sir.
[02:49:22.360 --> 02:49:26.582]  They're taking people's children who are like three times the class in Texas.
[02:49:26.582 --> 02:49:27.362]  And there is no law.
[02:49:28.288 --> 02:49:32.930]  Well, we're not the only case in Loudon County either.
[02:49:32.930 --> 02:49:42.034]  There's a whole group of us that are kind of in the process and we're kind of the number two case.
[02:49:42.034 --> 02:49:49.897]  The number one case is a woman who is a single mother with three children who was treated much more harshly.
[02:49:49.897 --> 02:49:51.677]  She was
[02:49:54.293 --> 02:49:56.914]  I think she was able to find somebody to watch her.
[02:50:13.829 --> 02:50:19.512]  Again, this is an excuse to kidnap us, get normal people into their military industrial prison complex.
[02:50:19.512 --> 02:50:21.813]  We have the biggest prison population in the world.
[02:50:21.813 --> 02:50:26.256]  It's a joke, and that cop needs to be fired, and they all need to go to jail for false arrest.
[02:50:27.381 --> 02:50:32.982]  Hey listen, when you prove that that wasn't in the law, that cop needs to go to jail, and so does all those other people.
[02:50:32.982 --> 02:50:34.003]  I'm sick of them.
[02:50:34.003 --> 02:50:36.043]  And you know, we need to get angry here, sir.
[02:50:36.043 --> 02:50:36.823]  We need to get angry.
[02:50:36.823 --> 02:50:40.124]  This is happening to you, it's happening to all of us, these scum.
[02:50:40.124 --> 02:50:43.425]  Mark Denicor, as this develops, we'd like to talk to you again.
[02:50:43.425 --> 02:50:47.706]  Is there any way we can help you out, or just let the court know, or what do we do?
[02:50:49.395 --> 02:50:51.760]  Well, um, I'm not sure.
[02:50:51.760 --> 02:50:53.223]  You know, I've done a lot of interviews.
[02:50:53.223 --> 02:50:57.392]  I think I'm reaching the point of diminishing returns.
[02:50:57.392 --> 02:50:58.694]  We've gotten the message out.
[02:50:58.694 --> 02:51:00.097]  I'll tell you what, stay there, stay there.

[02:53:52.732 --> 02:54:14.432]  I was going to let our guest go, but I was talking to him during the break and I said, how terrible this woman's kids were late to school and the police came and arrested her and he said, well it was traumatizing for us.
[02:54:14.432 --> 02:54:18.295]  The policeman came to their house, called them liars, got in their face.
[02:54:19.542 --> 02:54:22.969]  For his little daughters being late to school.
[02:54:22.969 --> 02:54:24.432]  And this is what happened in Austin.
[02:54:24.432 --> 02:54:26.556]  They would come and give you these big tickets.
[02:54:26.556 --> 02:54:27.918]  And then we looked at the code and it's like...
[02:54:28.880 --> 02:54:33.124]  Okay, you've been sick twice last semester, and you were late four times.
[02:54:33.124 --> 02:54:39.490]  Well, the law says it's a lot more truancies, but then it says parents are exempt if they knew.
[02:54:39.490 --> 02:54:43.954]  And now they're saying even letters don't do it?
[02:54:43.954 --> 02:54:46.677]  It's all about government taking over your life.
[02:54:46.677 --> 02:54:48.479]  This is the opposite of America.
[02:54:48.479 --> 02:54:51.602]  Imagine 50 years ago, cops coming to your door and calling you a liar.
[02:54:51.602 --> 02:54:52.583]  Man, I can't handle it.
[02:54:53.203 --> 02:54:54.985]  I mean, I can't handle it anymore.
[02:54:54.985 --> 02:54:56.406]  And again, they think they're doing good.
[02:54:56.406 --> 02:54:58.868]  They've been involved in tyranny so long.
[02:54:58.868 --> 02:55:00.350]  Tell us what happened to you, sir.
[02:55:00.350 --> 02:55:04.254]  Because you're in the Washington Post now, you're speaking out, you're all over talk radio.
[02:55:04.254 --> 02:55:06.736]  You say you go on some of these shows and they attack you.
[02:55:06.736 --> 02:55:07.977]  What about their due process?
[02:55:07.977 --> 02:55:08.978]  What about your due process?
[02:55:08.978 --> 02:55:10.519]  What about this isn't even a law?
[02:55:10.519 --> 02:55:13.222]  They're misappropriating, they're misapplying something.
[02:55:13.222 --> 02:55:13.943]  And they know it.
[02:55:14.463 --> 02:55:17.765]  Again, they know in Travis County it's illegal where I live.
[02:55:17.765 --> 02:55:18.646]  They don't care.
[02:55:18.646 --> 02:55:20.227]  They use your ignorance.
[02:55:20.227 --> 02:55:22.188]  They're a criminal operation.
[02:55:22.188 --> 02:55:24.750]  They're like, well, we're doing the good, so we lied to you.
[02:55:24.750 --> 02:55:25.971]  No, you're crooks.
[02:55:25.971 --> 02:55:31.734]  What about, instead of saying, I'm sorry, I should do better, but the law doesn't say this, how about you get angry?
[02:55:31.734 --> 02:55:33.636]  Tell us what this cop did when he came to your house.
[02:55:35.703 --> 02:55:38.165]  Well, yeah, he came to the house.
[02:55:38.165 --> 02:55:49.452]  My wife was at a child-rearing seminar that night, and I was staying at home with the kids, and we were actually doing homework and working on some art projects for an art show.
[02:55:49.452 --> 02:55:58.397]  And the police officer came to the door, banging on it, and he came into the house, and he asked for my ID.
[02:55:58.397 --> 02:56:01.759]  He came into your house violating the Fourth Amendment.
[02:56:01.759 --> 02:56:03.240]  How did that happen?
[02:56:03.240 --> 02:56:04.221]  He just bulled his way in?
[02:56:05.063 --> 02:56:09.064]  You know, it happened so quickly... You've got to get out of that county, man.
[02:56:09.064 --> 02:56:10.145]  It must be horrible.
[02:56:10.145 --> 02:56:11.005]  Okay, continue.
[02:56:11.005 --> 02:56:12.786]  I guess you are near the District of Criminals.
[02:56:12.786 --> 02:56:15.167]  Okay, what happened next?
[02:56:15.167 --> 02:56:18.808]  It happened so quickly, I wasn't sure if I invited him in or if he just walked in.
[02:56:18.808 --> 02:56:20.588]  You've got to learn not to invite vampires in.
[02:56:20.588 --> 02:56:22.569]  Go ahead.
[02:56:22.569 --> 02:56:27.851]  But he asked for my ID, and my three kids are with me and around me, ages 9, 7, and 6.
[02:56:32.105 --> 02:56:34.866]  I gave him my ID and then he said, uh, where's your wife?
[02:56:34.866 --> 02:56:36.967]  And I said, she's at a seminar.
[02:56:36.967 --> 02:56:40.349]  And then he turned to my children and says, where's your mother?
[02:56:40.349 --> 02:56:42.830]  Think about the contempt for America.
[02:56:42.830 --> 02:56:47.113]  Here you are, middle class, well-to-do, both lawyers, and he's treating you like trash.
[02:56:47.113 --> 02:56:52.295]  Imagine, this is a government servant who has turned into a redcoat.
[02:56:52.295 --> 02:56:55.677]  And so here he is, looking at your kids.
[02:56:55.677 --> 02:56:56.497]  Where's mommy?
[02:56:56.497 --> 02:56:57.698]  And then what did they say?
[02:56:58.758 --> 02:57:02.880]  He said he wasn't there, and then I said, do you think I'm lying to you?
[02:57:02.880 --> 02:57:04.580]  And he said yes.
[02:57:04.580 --> 02:57:05.581]  What scum.
[02:57:05.581 --> 02:57:07.642]  What's his name?
[02:57:07.642 --> 02:57:12.524]  Well, I don't, I do have his card, but I don't, you know, I can only fight one battle at a time.
[02:57:12.524 --> 02:57:14.224]  I wouldn't be afraid of him.
[02:57:14.224 --> 02:57:14.725]  So what?
[02:57:14.725 --> 02:57:16.665]  Let me, it's time to stand up.
[02:57:16.665 --> 02:57:16.805]  Okay.
[02:57:16.805 --> 02:57:22.248]  He's in your house talking to your kids, calling you a liar in front of them.
[02:57:22.248 --> 02:57:22.688]  Okay.
[02:57:22.688 --> 02:57:23.088]  Continue.
[02:57:23.088 --> 02:57:23.748]  How did this end?
[02:57:23.748 --> 02:57:26.209]  I filed a complaint on him immediately.
[02:57:29.375 --> 02:57:36.840]  Well I asked him if we could step out onto the front porch to continue our discussion and he refused.
[02:57:36.840 --> 02:57:38.341]  So he just stayed in your house?
[02:57:38.341 --> 02:57:39.582]  Yep.
[02:57:39.582 --> 02:57:42.824]  How long was he in your house illegally?
[02:57:42.824 --> 02:57:45.125]  At that point I told the kids to go upstairs.
[02:57:45.125 --> 02:57:48.767]  Okay, how long was this guy in your house?
[02:57:48.767 --> 02:57:51.469]  I would say, I don't know, 20 minutes.
[02:57:51.469 --> 02:57:52.590]  And what did he do, just stand there?
[02:57:53.683 --> 02:57:57.306]  No, he was filling out the paperwork to serve me with the summons.
[02:57:57.306 --> 02:57:58.447]  You gotta sue him, man.
[02:57:58.447 --> 02:57:59.127]  You gotta stand.
[02:57:59.127 --> 02:58:00.769]  Don't you understand, sir?
[02:58:00.769 --> 02:58:04.011]  They take people's kids all the time, and it's made-up paperwork.
[02:58:04.011 --> 02:58:05.112]  You gotta stand.
[02:58:05.112 --> 02:58:06.173]  You're dangerous.
[02:58:06.173 --> 02:58:08.195]  You gotta teach him when he's wrong.
[02:58:08.195 --> 02:58:09.676]  He thinks you're scum.
[02:58:09.676 --> 02:58:10.757]  He called you a liar.
[02:58:10.757 --> 02:58:12.679]  He forced his way in your house.
[02:58:12.679 --> 02:58:14.480]  He wouldn't get out of your house!
[02:58:14.480 --> 02:58:21.085]  Yeah, you know, I just tried to... You cannot appease them anymore!
[02:58:22.059 --> 02:58:24.440]  I don't have that much energy to fight everybody.
[02:58:24.440 --> 02:58:28.180]  So what did he do when he left?
[02:58:28.180 --> 02:58:35.262]  Well, he just, you know, after he served me with summons, then he left and we expected that he would come back and serve my wife.
[02:58:35.262 --> 02:58:36.222]  God bless you, sir.
[02:58:36.222 --> 02:58:38.703]  We've got to go into a little bit of overdrive here.
[02:58:38.703 --> 02:58:42.844]  Oh my gosh, this is unbelievable.
[02:58:42.844 --> 02:58:46.264]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:52.699 --> 02:58:56.721]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:58:56.721 --> 02:58:59.962]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:58:59.962 --> 02:59:04.764]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:59:04.764 --> 02:59:11.147]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:59:11.147 --> 02:59:13.388]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:59:13.928 --> 02:59:14.228]  Tim Geithner?
[02:59:14.228 --> 02:59:14.748]  Bernanke?
[02:59:14.748 --> 02:59:15.549]  They're arsonists!
[02:59:15.549 --> 02:59:16.529]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:59:16.529 --> 02:59:18.930]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:59:32.836 --> 02:59:37.218]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[02:59:37.218 --> 02:59:40.119]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:59:40.119 --> 02:59:52.265]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:59:52.265 --> 02:59:55.866]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.866 --> 02:59:59.068]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:25.600 --> 03:00:28.403]  Folks, when I get angry, it's because I know tyranny when I see it.
[03:00:28.403 --> 03:00:31.545]  A cop pushes into your house.
[03:00:31.545 --> 03:00:33.067]  He calls you a liar.
[03:00:33.067 --> 03:00:34.088]  Stays there 20 minutes.
[03:00:34.088 --> 03:00:34.788]  You tell him to leave.
[03:00:34.788 --> 03:00:35.709]  He won't.
[03:00:35.709 --> 03:00:38.952]  I mean, it's just... And they got articles everywhere.
[03:00:38.952 --> 03:00:40.293]  Get rid of the Constitution.
[03:00:40.293 --> 03:00:41.554]  I want to go to your calls.
[03:00:41.554 --> 03:00:43.016]  This is so important here, though.
[03:00:44.051 --> 03:00:47.394]  You were telling me, I was saying, how was that for your children to see that, sir?
[03:00:47.394 --> 03:00:51.337]  You're a lawyer, your wife's a lawyer, middle class, imagine what they're doing to poor people.
[03:00:51.337 --> 03:00:58.544]  Comes in your house, your little girls have been tardy, it's not even under the law, he's calling you a liar, all this is going on.
[03:00:58.544 --> 03:01:02.207]  He's with the Loudoun County Sheriff's Department in Virginia.
[03:01:02.207 --> 03:01:07.051]  Everybody, send this video to that scum, and that sheriff ought to be ashamed of themselves.
[03:01:07.051 --> 03:01:10.414]  Imagine, in front of little kids, what do you think the lesson is to your children?
[03:01:12.526 --> 03:01:20.952]  Well, you know, we talk about bullying a lot, and that our children shouldn't bully, and if they are being bullied, to tell us about it.
[03:01:20.952 --> 03:01:31.119]  So it was disappointing to see a police officer bullying me, and also having the school system bully the parents.
[03:01:31.119 --> 03:01:36.703]  There's a lot of bullying going on by the people that should be teaching our kids not to bully.
[03:01:36.892 --> 03:01:50.937]  Well, we're looking at a photo of Daisy, the seven-year-old, and I can't imagine as a man, because you sound like a very meek, polite person, I would imagine you were polite, and this guy's swaggering around, calling you a liar in front of your children.
[03:01:50.937 --> 03:01:54.039]  I mean, this sounds like something out of a cartoon or something.
[03:01:54.039 --> 03:02:00.041]  Well, I wouldn't describe myself as being meek, but I try to be professional.
[03:02:00.041 --> 03:02:01.301]  Gentlemenly.
[03:02:01.301 --> 03:02:01.822]  Gentlemenly.
[03:02:03.100 --> 03:02:06.423]  But my point is, you were talking to the cop like you are now, right?
[03:02:06.423 --> 03:02:08.024]  Just being polite, nice.
[03:02:08.024 --> 03:02:08.965]  Yeah.
[03:02:08.965 --> 03:02:10.186]  Man, I can't handle it.
[03:02:10.186 --> 03:02:12.428]  Just don't come to my house and do that, folks.
[03:02:12.428 --> 03:02:14.650]  I've had enough of it, you redcoats.
[03:02:14.650 --> 03:02:15.671]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:02:15.671 --> 03:02:20.595]  And so, I mean, of course, well mostly I wouldn't act like that anyways in front of kids or anybody.
[03:02:20.595 --> 03:02:22.937]  Why did he call you a liar?
[03:02:22.937 --> 03:02:27.681]  Well, because he thought my wife was evading service of her summons.
[03:02:31.445 --> 03:02:32.126]  Oh, unbelievable.
[03:02:32.126 --> 03:02:36.112]  I mean, you didn't even have to go to... Now, if you see cops at your door, are you gonna open it?
[03:02:36.112 --> 03:02:37.474]  I mean, I don't open it.
[03:02:38.874 --> 03:02:48.964]  Well, definitely this will run through my mind, but we decided to avoid any more scenes like that.
[03:02:48.964 --> 03:02:55.911]  Oh, and by the way, police, I have hidden wireless systems transmitting live video from my house and hidden cameras in the house.
[03:02:55.911 --> 03:02:56.652]  No, I do.
[03:02:56.652 --> 03:02:58.995]  I'm just waiting some day when they try to set me up.
[03:02:58.995 --> 03:03:00.156]  They have an advanced team.
[03:03:00.156 --> 03:03:01.978]  They're not going to stop all our footage being sent out.
[03:03:02.398 --> 03:03:05.681]  I spent a lot of money to make sure it's all under surveillance.
[03:03:05.681 --> 03:03:09.944]  They're not going to come to my house and kill me or set me up without it going out.
[03:03:09.944 --> 03:03:11.185]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:03:11.185 --> 03:03:25.497]  Well, I was just saying to avoid any further incidents like that, we decided to have my wife come with me to court even though she hadn't been served a summons so that we wouldn't have the police coming by to do that anymore.
[03:03:26.564 --> 03:03:27.304]  Well, God bless you.
[03:03:27.304 --> 03:03:31.426]  You know, sir, I'm ranting at you because Patrick Henry ranted, Thomas Jefferson did.
[03:03:31.426 --> 03:03:33.586]  We need to get angry about this.
[03:03:33.586 --> 03:03:46.951]  And after you defeated this case, for all the others in the country, and another example of how they're doing all this by color of law, I hope that you sue that deputy for violating your civil rights and your God-given rights.
[03:03:46.951 --> 03:03:52.352]  I mean, he came in your house, but you're not sure whether you were being nice or whatever, just kind of, you know, they pushed their way in.
[03:03:52.352 --> 03:03:54.253]  But when you asked him to leave, he said, nope.
[03:03:54.991 --> 03:03:56.092]  Well, I didn't ask him to leave.
[03:03:56.092 --> 03:03:59.355]  I just asked him to step out on the front porch so he could get away from the kids.
[03:03:59.355 --> 03:04:00.016]  Yeah, no, no.
[03:04:00.016 --> 03:04:02.258]  That's asking him to leave your house, technically.
[03:04:02.258 --> 03:04:03.119]  Okay.
[03:04:03.119 --> 03:04:05.681]  And what did he say to you at that point?
[03:04:05.681 --> 03:04:07.103]  He said he wouldn't leave.
[03:04:07.103 --> 03:04:09.125]  I'd have called the police right then.
[03:04:09.125 --> 03:04:10.446]  He wasn't the police.
[03:04:10.446 --> 03:04:11.607]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:04:11.607 --> 03:04:14.129]  You get a record of his criminality.
[03:04:14.129 --> 03:04:15.311]  No, you get a record of it.
[03:04:16.038 --> 03:04:18.480]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[03:04:18.480 --> 03:04:19.180]  You get a record.
[03:04:19.180 --> 03:04:21.361]  You go, okay, so you're in my house without a warrant.
[03:04:21.361 --> 03:04:22.602]  You're refusing to leave.
[03:04:22.602 --> 03:04:25.264]  I'm going to call the Sheriff's Department and report you.
[03:04:25.264 --> 03:04:25.824]  You understand?
[03:04:25.824 --> 03:04:27.385]  You dial 911.
[03:04:27.385 --> 03:04:28.866]  Yeah.
[03:04:28.866 --> 03:04:32.389]  And then, of course, you're very calm because some places are totally criminal.
[03:04:32.389 --> 03:04:34.510]  Well, God bless you, sir.
[03:04:34.510 --> 03:04:36.491]  Was this unlike other radio interviews you've done?
[03:04:36.491 --> 03:04:39.893]  Yes.
[03:04:39.893 --> 03:04:43.916]  And we told you we weren't going to have you on and lecture you about having your kids in the brainwashing center, okay?
[03:04:46.687 --> 03:04:50.593]  By the way, your daughters are only gonna learn how to be drug addicts and promiscuous at that school.
[03:04:50.593 --> 03:04:52.316]  I'd get them out of a government training camp.
[03:04:52.316 --> 03:04:55.220]  Why don't you just get them out of the government training camp?
[03:04:55.220 --> 03:04:58.185]  Uh, we've considered, uh, homeschooling, but, uh... Do it!
[03:04:58.185 --> 03:04:58.626]  Do it!
[03:04:58.626 --> 03:05:00.068]  Take them out of that evil system!
[03:05:00.068 --> 03:05:01.370]  God bless you, sir!
[03:05:01.370 --> 03:05:02.371]  We stand with you!
[03:05:02.371 --> 03:05:04.515]  There are limitless ways to go into business for yourself.
