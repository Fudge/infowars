[00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.831]  Welcome, this is the 4th of July edition of the Ask Alex.
[00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:10.892]  We are taking your questions in the Ask Alex group from Planet InfoWars.
[00:00:11.012 --> 00:00:13.252]  I'm here with our guest, Alex Jones.
[00:00:13.472 --> 00:00:18.174]  Alex, one of the questions comes to you from GirlWarrior, pretty legit username.
[00:00:18.854 --> 00:00:27.436]  I heard from a friend that when you're not home, the utilities company can come by your house and have the authority to switch to the new smart meter without your permission.
[00:00:27.456 --> 00:00:28.256]  What are your thoughts?
[00:00:28.416 --> 00:00:34.920]  Yeah, just like the federal government has the authority to ship guns into Mexico and hand grenades and cocaine back in, they don't have the authority.
[00:00:35.541 --> 00:00:36.721]  They just do it criminally.
[00:00:37.662 --> 00:00:44.026]  And that is exactly what is happening with the United Nations saying it commands our military now.
[00:00:44.806 --> 00:00:52.631]  That's what's happening with all of these power grabs, with the TSA, who aren't even sworn officers, out of their federal jurisdiction, groping people.
[00:00:53.412 --> 00:00:56.534]  That's what tyranny is, is just a giant power grab.
[00:00:57.725 --> 00:00:58.645]  And that's what they're doing.
[00:00:59.305 --> 00:01:06.647]  And first they lied and said the smart meters weren't going to be tracking us or controlling our temperature or interfacing with other appliances.
[00:01:06.707 --> 00:01:07.487]  Now they admit it.
[00:01:08.287 --> 00:01:14.449]  And a lot of jurisdictions and different municipalities, people have beaten the smart meters.
[00:01:14.989 --> 00:01:16.569]  So it's a propaganda name.
[00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:17.929]  It's a smart meter.
[00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:25.151]  You just tell the utility company that you don't want it and you get together with your city and tell them you're not going to have these systems.
[00:01:26.215 --> 00:01:34.220]  So people need to explain, hey, we're not against technology, we don't like the back doors and the dual use that all these things have.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.441]  And the mis-marketing of it.
[00:01:36.021 --> 00:01:39.864]  And then they're charging us for the products as well through our bills.
[00:01:40.044 --> 00:01:46.288]  You know, it's like a cell phone has all this tech in it to spy on us that we end up paying for as part of the cost.
[00:01:46.988 --> 00:01:49.570]  All of this stuff is having back doors built into it.
[00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.832]  The entire architecture of technology is to control populations.
[00:01:54.878 --> 00:02:04.581]  Well, the next question actually comes to you from Travis and he says, have we gotten to the bottom of who's responsible for chemtrails and geoengineering so we can ask them to stop?
[00:02:05.201 --> 00:02:09.583]  Is there some sort of like, you can pinpoint it to this person, this company, this
[00:02:11.107 --> 00:02:18.995]  Well, it's the DARPA-controlled network of colleges and federal departments like the Department of Energy.
[00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:29.426]  These giant bureaucracies, they don't call it chemtrails in their documents, but they hide in plain view that, oh, we have semi-classified and classified programs about high-altitude aerosol programs.
[00:02:29.966 --> 00:02:36.196]  And then you can pull up articles where NASA says the Earth's 20-plus percent darker now because less sunlight's hitting us in all this news.
[00:02:37.298 --> 00:02:44.009]  So, no, I mean, it's hidden behind national security, but there's all these icebergs sticking up out of the water.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.121]  You know, showing us where larger structures are.
[00:02:47.621 --> 00:02:53.303]  And there are huge programs of geoengineering, as the White House scientists are, three and a half years ago when they first got in office.
[00:02:53.763 --> 00:02:58.625]  John P. Holder admitted, oh, we're involved in a whole geoengineering, changing our Earth's atmosphere.
[00:02:58.905 --> 00:03:00.146]  Bill Gates is involved in it.
[00:03:00.406 --> 00:03:03.027]  Spends billions, but it's all classified.
[00:03:04.092 --> 00:03:04.312]  I don't
[00:03:20.922 --> 00:03:21.843]  And now they don't.
[00:03:22.423 --> 00:03:24.425]  And then there's the question, well, are there spray planes?
[00:03:24.785 --> 00:03:26.147]  Is it mixed into the jet fuel?
[00:03:26.867 --> 00:03:39.518]  Five years ago, I said, let's look and see at patents for adding aluminum dioxide, barium salts, and other things into jet fuel so that the jet engines could dissipate nuclei to create cloud condensation.
[00:03:39.538 --> 00:03:40.359]  And the thin layer.
[00:03:41.152 --> 00:03:44.414]  And then sure enough, oh, there's dozens and dozens.
[00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:45.315]  I'm being conservative.
[00:03:45.335 --> 00:03:46.115]  I don't want to say hundreds.
[00:03:47.096 --> 00:03:48.016]  That's how we self-censor.
[00:03:48.036 --> 00:03:48.997]  It's hundreds of patents.
[00:03:49.437 --> 00:03:52.179]  There's actually hundreds, but let's just say dozens and dozens.
[00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.759]  You can look them up.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.741]  We've done news reports on them.
[00:03:55.161 --> 00:03:56.462]  Just type into the search engine.
[00:03:57.202 --> 00:03:59.003]  It's looking both ways, the NSA system.
[00:03:59.323 --> 00:03:59.684]  Google.
[00:04:00.544 --> 00:04:03.606]  Or whatever system you use, it all wires to the same place in the end.
[00:04:04.006 --> 00:04:15.831]  Just type in patents for jet engines dispensing chemtrails, and it should come up.
[00:04:16.132 --> 00:04:18.093]  Of course, it won't say that in the test.
[00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:22.995]  It'll say patents for jet engines for weather modification to disperse it.
[00:04:23.515 --> 00:04:25.056]  But that'll get you to the documents.
[00:04:25.492 --> 00:04:26.612]  Yeah.
[00:04:26.692 --> 00:04:27.793]  And then don't just believe the documents.
[00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:28.353]  Go to the U.S.
[00:04:28.373 --> 00:04:30.213]  Patent Office online, type it in, and there it'll be.
[00:04:30.313 --> 00:04:32.474]  We have the right to look for those documents too, right?
[00:04:33.274 --> 00:04:33.654]  Yes.
[00:04:34.854 --> 00:04:38.815]  Alright, well the next question actually comes to you from FreeHotDogs.
[00:04:39.775 --> 00:04:43.916]  I'd like to ask whether or not you know about actively staffed FEMA camps in America.
[00:04:43.936 --> 00:04:47.917]  I know that you've done that shoot with Jesse Ventura where you guys saw the
[00:04:49.079 --> 00:04:50.760]  The black coffins, etc.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:57.283]  But I happen to know that there's a FEMA facility in the Mexican farms in Maryland, and it's staffed and fully active.
[00:04:57.323 --> 00:05:00.285]  There are guards with machine guns posted at all times.
[00:05:00.585 --> 00:05:05.328]  They're guarding about 120 trailers that are all run down, and they're just crappy.
[00:05:05.828 --> 00:05:09.530]  And a large former hangar used to be a small airport.
[00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:17.014]  Anyway, so... Okay, well, the person, if they, you know, at their own risk feel like doing it, they should go out there with the camera
[00:05:17.674 --> 00:05:21.936]  And take a bunch of pictures and get it to us.
[00:05:22.637 --> 00:05:23.277]  Show the guards.
[00:05:23.317 --> 00:05:27.699]  I mean, I would personally, I would pull up with my friends in a truck and say, what is this?
[00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:28.820]  And let them try to get in my face.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.020]  Right.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.380]  You know, this is America.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.161]  Right.
[00:05:31.241 --> 00:05:32.962]  And you'll learn if you grovel these people.
[00:05:33.582 --> 00:05:35.443]  They get in your face, but you pull up and say, what is this?
[00:05:35.463 --> 00:05:36.083]  Start taping.
[00:05:36.143 --> 00:05:38.544]  They'll grovel to you, at least in most cases.
[00:05:39.285 --> 00:05:42.366]  Or do, you know, sneak up during the day in the bushes and get photos.
[00:05:42.706 --> 00:05:43.886]  Do it however you want.
[00:05:43.947 --> 00:05:48.468]  But yes, they have these old military bases, FEMA emergency centers.
[00:05:48.829 --> 00:05:50.229]  Some of them staff, some of them not.
[00:05:50.769 --> 00:05:51.350]  A lot of them
[00:05:52.210 --> 00:06:10.640]  They're holding illegal aliens in and that's what they said back in the 80s in Rex 84 that when they got ready to use them they would prime them generally with a small you know immigrant population just to you know it's kind of its operational cover with them just waiting and that's the Emergency Centers Establishment Act that came out in congressional hearings.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.141]  It's the Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program.
[00:06:14.181 --> 00:06:14.761]  Look that up.
[00:06:14.821 --> 00:06:15.821]  That's a cover for it.
[00:06:16.441 --> 00:06:18.041]  Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program.
[00:06:18.942 --> 00:06:20.562]  There's a bunch of these things going on.
[00:06:21.022 --> 00:06:23.703]  And it's admitted that for continuity of government, they have these.
[00:06:23.723 --> 00:06:27.563]  I mean, we got the Army document a few months ago that was about re-education centers.
[00:06:27.864 --> 00:06:30.524]  And the Army responded and said, yeah, that's our document.
[00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:35.285]  And, you know, as for staffing them... No shame.
[00:06:35.605 --> 00:06:36.125]  No shame at all.
[00:06:36.145 --> 00:06:36.885]  No, they have no shame.
[00:06:37.386 --> 00:06:38.626]  As for staffing them, they...
[00:06:40.367 --> 00:06:54.381]  Was it six months ago or so there was the on the federal websites they were putting out the bids for companies to be on standby as managers waiting to activate camps with with personnel
[00:06:55.356 --> 00:06:55.636]  We're good.
[00:07:16.795 --> 00:07:19.257]  Why wouldn't they just ship them back where they were coming from?
[00:07:19.778 --> 00:07:26.243]  Because they hold them there while the immigration lawyer stuff's going through and things.
[00:07:26.463 --> 00:07:27.344]  Okay.
[00:07:27.484 --> 00:07:29.626]  But it's just a perfect way to prime the pump.
[00:07:30.287 --> 00:07:39.454]  I mean, in Ventura's TV show, I took him out to the FEMA Center, Department of Homeland Security, with the flag and all that, with the playground.
[00:07:40.415 --> 00:07:40.976]  What was it called?
[00:07:41.735 --> 00:07:50.020]  Yeah, I mean it had little kids running around out at the playground and then they took it to the congressman and he goes, oh, there are no children, those are Martians coming down out of the sky.
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.302]  And Ventura's like, no, no, this is a bill, and I've been out to some of the camps.
[00:07:53.883 --> 00:07:56.204]  And the guy went, oh, I do remember those camps.
[00:07:56.304 --> 00:07:58.205]  He was from Tennessee, but he had like a Georgia accent.
[00:07:58.866 --> 00:08:00.267]  And people can watch it online.
[00:08:00.727 --> 00:08:02.768]  And then Ventura goes, but I saw kids.
[00:08:02.788 --> 00:08:04.810]  He goes, they were probably very happy children.
[00:08:05.706 --> 00:08:13.193]  And it was just like, and it was so weird that Homeland Security freaked out because it really showed their normal arrogance didn't work right.
[00:08:13.213 --> 00:08:15.595]  And it kind of clicked the wrong way.
[00:08:15.835 --> 00:08:19.698]  So they threatened to have it, people basically, you know, arrested.
[00:08:20.239 --> 00:08:21.740]  And so they pulled it off television.
[00:08:22.011 --> 00:08:23.512]  Yeah, and out of your TiVos and all that.
[00:08:23.532 --> 00:08:24.033]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:08:24.353 --> 00:08:32.159]  This next question actually comes to you from Freedom Spear, and it says, this is about how language is used to enslave us, which I thought was a great intro.
[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:38.003]  I never hear the elite refer to themselves as human or being part of mankind.
[00:08:38.444 --> 00:08:47.351]  Gender aside, isn't it true, since we are men, that being called hue, which is a shade, and men being, you know, hue men, making up hue men, is part of the
[00:08:47.731 --> 00:08:48.151]  We're good to go.
[00:09:17.859 --> 00:09:25.903]  Humanity is seen as reaching towards being kind, compassionate, loving, things like that, instead of being barbarous like the animals.
[00:09:26.244 --> 00:09:31.366]  Primitive man noticed that the animals were, you know, vicious and very mean to each other and it was dog eat dog.
[00:09:31.907 --> 00:09:41.472]  And so humanity is about building a civilization where things that are beautiful and pure and scientific can flourish, instead of going back to barbarism.
[00:09:41.952 --> 00:09:48.636]  And so it's saying we're reaching towards humanity out of the bloody slime that is warfare and all of that.
[00:09:49.436 --> 00:10:03.864]  And the globalists do see it as refined, that they're cold-blooded and survival of the fittest, social Darwinist, who think it's good to be cruel and horrible, and have romanticized barbarism.
[00:10:05.145 --> 00:10:07.086]  That is a more modern idea.
[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.541]  And so it shows how they are agents of dehumanization.
[00:10:12.621 --> 00:10:13.801]  Have you ever noticed that yourself?
[00:10:14.141 --> 00:10:15.382]  Like listening to them speak?
[00:10:16.322 --> 00:10:17.542]  They never refer to them like that.
[00:10:18.083 --> 00:10:18.523]  I have not.
[00:10:18.603 --> 00:10:24.744]  I don't think I've watched enough to say yes or no one way or the other, but there's a curious point he made.
[00:10:26.785 --> 00:10:32.086]  Well, definitely the ruling class and their minions understand they're programming the public.
[00:10:32.126 --> 00:10:34.047]  So everything they do is basically acting.
[00:10:36.735 --> 00:10:39.756]  But I have noticed some of what the person raises.
[00:10:40.296 --> 00:10:40.676]  Interesting.
[00:10:41.017 --> 00:10:42.837]  This next one comes to you from Loretta.
[00:10:43.197 --> 00:10:58.523]  She says, Alex, since Obama is arrogant and he has an immigration policy and it's up to his discretion, which you've referred to as treasonous, why don't we suggest to Dr. Paul that during his closing days of his term in Congress that he start impeachment processing?
[00:10:59.872 --> 00:11:00.893]  Well, that's the issue.
[00:11:00.913 --> 00:11:07.456]  I didn't just get mad at Rand Paul three, four weeks ago over the fact he endorsed Mitt Romney.
[00:11:08.516 --> 00:11:14.299]  I get all the Ron Paul literature because I've given money to Ron Paul, Rand Paul, Campaign for Liberty.
[00:11:14.619 --> 00:11:16.500]  My family has, so I get all the literature.
[00:11:17.121 --> 00:11:20.782]  And it was just kind of keeping this whole thing going that, oh, we're still going to win.
[00:11:20.882 --> 00:11:21.303]  Oh, yeah.
[00:11:21.783 --> 00:11:23.624]  You know, let's be really strong into the
[00:11:24.974 --> 00:11:26.035]  I think so.
[00:11:46.175 --> 00:11:47.336]  And I'm not criticizing the Pauls.
[00:11:47.376 --> 00:11:50.879]  I mean, you know, they're great on the Second Amendment, national sovereignty, Federal Reserve.
[00:11:50.899 --> 00:11:51.539]  They're great people.
[00:11:51.899 --> 00:11:56.283]  It's just that they'd always been so pure and not about politics and just so straight up.
[00:11:56.663 --> 00:12:02.668]  You can see a transition's happening as Ron Paul gets ready to pretty much retire and maybe write books, give a few speeches.
[00:12:03.128 --> 00:12:04.209]  He's run a long race.
[00:12:04.249 --> 00:12:04.830]  Who'd blame him?
[00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:06.631]  I mean, I'm surprised he can see straight.
[00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:08.332]  Yeah, 70-something.
[00:12:08.352 --> 00:12:08.332]  76.
[00:12:08.432 --> 00:12:10.514]  I mean, I'm exhausted up here taping this right now.
[00:12:10.554 --> 00:12:11.575]  I'm 38 years old.
[00:12:12.195 --> 00:12:13.917]  So I'm not here judging.
[00:12:15.014 --> 00:12:19.877]  It's just that I've seen a lot less, you know, hardcore stuff coming out.
[00:12:20.177 --> 00:12:23.780]  And I would have liked to see, you know, Ron Paul pushing for actual impeachment.
[00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:30.264]  I would have liked to seen Ron Paul getting more aggressive now when he had all this political capital.
[00:12:31.505 --> 00:12:36.988]  And instead, it's all being kind of put into rand and given respect by the Republican Party power structure.
[00:12:37.068 --> 00:12:40.271]  Do you think maybe that was his reasoning for not doing it?
[00:12:40.291 --> 00:12:41.912]  To help his son in a way?
[00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:51.651]  I mean, his political advisors have said a lot.
[00:12:53.231 --> 00:12:55.132]  I mean, they've said, oh, we've got to endorse Romney.
[00:12:55.152 --> 00:12:56.312]  The Republicans will like us then.
[00:12:56.352 --> 00:13:00.093]  Well, why didn't your dad just support the wars then if you want mainline Republicans to like you?
[00:13:00.573 --> 00:13:02.373]  So, it's just a changing of course.
[00:13:02.393 --> 00:13:03.913]  I mean, they still stand for good things.
[00:13:04.353 --> 00:13:10.454]  It's just the old Ron Paul did not endorse McCain four years ago.
[00:13:11.014 --> 00:13:12.855]  And people say, well, this is his son.
[00:13:12.895 --> 00:13:13.795]  This isn't Ron Paul.
[00:13:14.926 --> 00:13:17.267]  But Rand Paul was sold to us that he was like his dad.
[00:13:17.447 --> 00:13:17.687]  Exactly.
[00:13:17.967 --> 00:13:22.608]  And they use, you know, that Campaign for Liberty list and all that to support him.
[00:13:23.549 --> 00:13:24.349]  And I like Rand Paul.
[00:13:24.369 --> 00:13:25.909]  He's fighting the TSA.
[00:13:25.969 --> 00:13:28.190]  He's fighting expanding, you know, some of these wars.
[00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:30.191]  He's fighting a whole bunch of issues.
[00:13:31.831 --> 00:13:36.393]  It's just that he's compromising a lot more than his father.
[00:13:37.632 --> 00:13:42.516]  And if he continues to compromise down the road, there is a major change, of course, there.
[00:13:42.856 --> 00:13:45.158]  And so people say, hey, wouldn't it be great if Ron Paul did this?
[00:13:45.178 --> 00:13:46.399]  Wouldn't it be great if Ron Paul did that?
[00:13:46.479 --> 00:13:48.061]  Yeah.
[00:13:48.621 --> 00:13:50.503]  People put a lot of faith in one person, though.
[00:13:50.703 --> 00:13:53.105]  I mean, I see that over and over, just on Planet InfoWars.
[00:13:53.165 --> 00:13:56.467]  People are constantly asking, Alex, can you sign my petition?
[00:13:56.567 --> 00:13:57.408]  Alex, can you do this?
[00:13:57.528 --> 00:13:58.869]  Alex, can you give me this suggestion?
[00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:00.731]  I think it's just human nature.
[00:14:00.771 --> 00:14:02.032]  We want to just support one person.
[00:14:04.132 --> 00:14:26.194]  It's the little things that we do we forget about that we we can make a difference Exactly people think there's like some magic bullet silver bullet that's gonna do it all when it's a process I mean people have to get back to basic understanding of how government works and then not put up with it and then get angry and Go into City Council and the legislatures and everywhere and say listen crooks.
[00:14:26.234 --> 00:14:27.235]  We know what you're doing and
[00:14:28.479 --> 00:14:31.462]  That's the only thing that has any hope, and the system knows we're going that direction.
[00:14:31.482 --> 00:14:35.606]  That's why they're openly arming to the teeth in a huge military build-up against us.
[00:14:36.567 --> 00:14:37.708]  This is real tyranny.
[00:14:38.128 --> 00:14:40.390]  We use that word tyranny, tyranny, tyranny, but I mean, this is it.
[00:14:43.885 --> 00:14:50.407]  The globalists are precipitating this collapse, and I think a lot of people, including the Pauls, are just circling their wagons.
[00:14:51.067 --> 00:14:58.949]  Because what's happening is so big and so dangerous and so volatile, and so much of the public is totally in la-la land.
[00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:08.673]  I understand the allure of meeting with Mitt Romney and him saying, oh, I agree with a lot of what you're saying, and hey, I'm not Obama, so hey, let's support you.
[00:15:08.713 --> 00:15:09.933]  Yeah, the Republicans are going to save us.
[00:15:10.253 --> 00:15:14.415]  But the Republicans are bought and paid for by the very same interest that gave us Barack Obama.
[00:15:14.635 --> 00:15:23.098]  And nowhere do you see that being more closely aligned than all this criticism of Obama and his horrible government takeover plan, much of which came from Mitt Romney.
[00:15:23.118 --> 00:15:25.679]  People say, well, you know, he wouldn't have the IRS enforce it.
[00:15:26.738 --> 00:15:27.098]  Whatever.
[00:15:27.158 --> 00:15:29.700]  The point is, is that... Potato, potato.
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:30.260]  Exactly.
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.841]  There's so little difference, but I'm going on and on here.
[00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:33.542]  I like it.
[00:15:33.562 --> 00:15:34.722]  I like getting you to go on and on.
[00:15:35.463 --> 00:15:37.584]  This next question actually comes to you from Anouk.
[00:15:37.904 --> 00:15:38.865]  I think I'm saying that right.
[00:15:41.006 --> 00:15:48.430]  What do you think is the role of my Royal Shell Queen Beatrice in the New World Order slash Bilderberg?
[00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:54.373]  After Bilderberg, she was visiting Turkey and the Dutch press don't even mention it.
[00:15:56.155 --> 00:16:04.550]  Well, the Dutch royal family sued the Associated Press a few years ago because they were down in South America, I think on the Brazilian coast, riding jet skis around their yacht.
[00:16:05.529 --> 00:16:08.290]  Right off the coast, and they were saying... In like a public space?
[00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.872]  Yeah, they were saying the AP should not be able to photograph us.
[00:16:10.892 --> 00:16:12.252]  It's just pure arrogance.
[00:16:12.712 --> 00:16:16.654]  They have all this PR, how she's a nice old lady, rides bikes, and... Do you have an ice cream cone, too?
[00:16:16.914 --> 00:16:19.035]  I was about to say, and Warren Buffett's got an ice cream cone?
[00:16:19.055 --> 00:16:20.636]  I mean, real tyrants.
[00:16:21.076 --> 00:16:23.958]  She owns most of Dutch Rochelle, part of BP.
[00:16:24.018 --> 00:16:32.862]  Her dad was a big Nazi and big globalist eugenicist with Prince Philip, setting up the World Wildlife Fund so they could, you know, have, you know,
[00:16:33.582 --> 00:16:33.702]  Yes.
[00:16:51.158 --> 00:16:52.639]  Yeah, people ask, what's her role there?
[00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:54.019]  I mean, she's right at the top of it.
[00:16:54.499 --> 00:16:56.460]  She's related to Queen Elizabeth.
[00:16:56.841 --> 00:16:58.281]  I mean, this is the ruling class.
[00:16:58.381 --> 00:17:03.904]  These are the people who have this whole oligarchical system that they've built.
[00:17:04.564 --> 00:17:07.845]  Where did you find out that her dad founded Bilderberg?
[00:17:08.205 --> 00:17:10.226]  I mean, just for people that want to find out themselves.
[00:17:10.406 --> 00:17:10.687]  Sure.
[00:17:12.168 --> 00:17:13.329]  Those documents have been leaked.
[00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:14.510]  The BBC's reported on it.
[00:17:15.011 --> 00:17:19.254]  Their first official meeting they had under other names was in 1954 in Oosterbeek, Holland.
[00:17:20.736 --> 00:17:22.357]  We've gotten the private papers of U.S.
[00:17:22.397 --> 00:17:25.059]  Senators that we've published and leaked, but I mean, it's not debated.
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:29.663]  Bilderberg itself, since it's been forced out in the public the last decade or so, is
[00:17:31.138 --> 00:17:35.583]  I mean, admitted a lot of this, but I mean, Queen Beatrix, I mean, we've gotten the list before.
[00:17:35.603 --> 00:17:42.471]  I mean, she's, you know, kind of like the Grand Poobah of it.
[00:17:45.024 --> 00:17:46.405]  I hope that answers your question, Anouk.
[00:17:47.006 --> 00:17:50.049]  Alright, this next one comes to you from Ronan for Liberty.
[00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:54.833]  And he says, here is why I haven't heard you talk about, Alex.
[00:17:55.213 --> 00:18:05.001]  The superconductor in Waxahachie, Texas, about 30 minutes outside of Dallas, that closed down many years ago, has been used for anti-terrorist training for a few years now.
[00:18:05.381 --> 00:18:08.164]  And part of the underground tunnel was built, but never finished.
[00:18:08.624 --> 00:18:12.725]  So who knows what else they do down there or even that they've stopped digging.
[00:18:12.745 --> 00:18:13.165]  We don't know.
[00:18:13.905 --> 00:18:19.026]  I know you mentioned a few weeks back some underground bases, places like Mount Weather.
[00:18:19.866 --> 00:18:25.848]  Do you have any comments on former superconductors or what's going on or any knowledge of what's there?
[00:18:25.868 --> 00:18:30.589]  No, we're moving to hire more reporters so we can cover things like that.
[00:18:31.269 --> 00:18:32.109]  But I think it was
[00:18:36.405 --> 00:18:52.438]  Eight years ago or so up in Waxahachie that it was in the news that they completed more than half of a giant underground loop for the superconducting supercollider and that they did turn it into a giant anti-terrorism underground training base.
[00:18:52.978 --> 00:18:55.779]  Which is actually a good place to do it, instead of all these military drills.
[00:18:56.019 --> 00:18:58.560]  We don't have anywhere to train, we just got giant bases everywhere.
[00:18:58.581 --> 00:19:02.062]  You know, Fort Hood, 5, 6, 7 times the size of Dallas-Fort Worth.
[00:19:02.342 --> 00:19:05.443]  But we've got to drive through your town and do live fire exercises at 2am.
[00:19:06.004 --> 00:19:09.265]  It's to acclimate the troops, the police, the public to having military.
[00:19:09.565 --> 00:19:11.246]  And now the Secretary of the Army has said that.
[00:19:11.566 --> 00:19:13.047]  Hey, they want to put a brigade in every city.
[00:19:14.007 --> 00:19:14.527]  4,000 plus troops.
[00:19:15.148 --> 00:19:17.449]  So yeah, they, a private company, leased it.
[00:19:18.309 --> 00:19:21.671]  Uh, and I even meant to go do a report on it, but back then didn't have any reporters.
[00:19:22.691 --> 00:19:24.272]  Uh, but Waxahachie's up there.
[00:19:24.332 --> 00:19:29.774]  We should try to, try to call him and get in there and see him because it'd just be neat to go into those caverns.
[00:19:29.875 --> 00:19:30.155]  Yeah.
[00:19:30.595 --> 00:19:33.736]  Uh, regardless, but to us just south of Dallas, Waxahachie, Texas.
[00:19:34.277 --> 00:19:36.498]  And indeed, I did cover that a long time ago.
[00:19:37.735 --> 00:19:41.237]  But I suggest, you know, sometimes we say we want to go into things and people are scared of us.
[00:19:41.537 --> 00:19:42.898]  This is InfoWars.com.
[00:19:44.238 --> 00:19:46.099]  Maybe folks should call themselves citizen journalists.
[00:19:46.119 --> 00:19:51.002]  You know, start a website, start doing 10-15 reports on local politics news.
[00:19:51.682 --> 00:19:56.004]  That's basically your cover, you know, that you really are a journalist.
[00:19:56.465 --> 00:20:02.908]  And by cover, the fact that you're a patriot, but now you are a local journalist and now you have a way to get into things.
[00:20:04.124 --> 00:20:06.105]  You know, get into football games free.
[00:20:06.125 --> 00:20:07.707]  You know, you're part of the press.
[00:20:08.087 --> 00:20:09.228]  Make a little press pass up.
[00:20:09.308 --> 00:20:09.648]  Call them.
[00:20:09.668 --> 00:20:10.268]  Get on the list.
[00:20:10.589 --> 00:20:11.589]  Get into political events.
[00:20:11.649 --> 00:20:12.450]  Go take photos.
[00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:13.371]  Post them.
[00:20:13.711 --> 00:20:14.491]  Run stories.
[00:20:15.112 --> 00:20:16.633]  Might end up at InfoWars.com.
[00:20:16.733 --> 00:20:16.993]  Absolutely.
[00:20:17.113 --> 00:20:18.034]  Or DrugsReport.com.
[00:20:18.074 --> 00:20:18.674]  Or who knows where?
[00:20:18.714 --> 00:20:19.615]  WorldNetDaily.com.
[00:20:19.755 --> 00:20:21.036]  That's a great point you make.
[00:20:21.517 --> 00:20:24.779]  Writing articles and things like that, that's exactly why Planet InfoWars is around.
[00:20:24.819 --> 00:20:31.225]  It's so people can write articles and in fact we've just started, via you, putting these on InfoWars.com, the main page.
[00:20:31.325 --> 00:20:38.331]  So if you write a good article, I'm watching, my fellow moderator Louis is watching, we're trying to do exactly that.
[00:20:38.511 --> 00:20:41.454]  Post things, spread the word, little local stuff.
[00:20:42.239 --> 00:20:50.327]  Sure, I mean, because it needs to get to the point it's already started with all the big cities and a lot of small towns where you can go in there and that's one thing we got to work on is the search engine.
[00:20:50.367 --> 00:20:52.069]  I keep meaning to tell them that because
[00:20:54.019 --> 00:20:55.360]  It's got it for privacy.
[00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:56.040]  Huh?
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.561]  Like make it more refined kind of?
[00:20:57.841 --> 00:21:15.148]  I don't know it's just that sometimes I mean we're again we're I mean we're in beta but we want your suggestions it's just that sometimes I search stuff even in Google and like even though it's the NSA even though it's horrible we probably need to have a link to that or explain people you know you can use this to find really you know really refined stuff in there but
[00:21:15.942 --> 00:21:17.043]  I'm brainstorming, it doesn't matter.
[00:21:17.083 --> 00:21:21.608]  The point is, you can go in, search, find groups in your area, and then just do it.
[00:21:21.628 --> 00:21:23.530]  People are like, well, I want to fight the New World Order.
[00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:24.832]  Well, call yourself press.
[00:21:25.172 --> 00:21:26.173]  Go out and do reports.
[00:21:26.714 --> 00:21:29.657]  Whether it's a video report, text report, photos, whatever.
[00:21:29.717 --> 00:21:31.479]  Just start reporting on what's happening.
[00:21:32.019 --> 00:21:33.341]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:21:33.421 --> 00:21:35.443]  And PlanetInfoWorks.com is a great place to do it.
[00:21:35.825 --> 00:21:40.206]  I actually, this next question is more, it is about kind of local situation.
[00:21:40.486 --> 00:21:42.187]  It's actually from several users.
[00:21:42.687 --> 00:21:45.127]  Lightningfoot, Nick, Kevin, those are just to name a few.
[00:21:45.147 --> 00:21:47.008]  They've all been asking about Colorado.
[00:21:47.068 --> 00:21:47.848]  It's on fire!
[00:21:48.688 --> 00:21:49.448]  And other areas.
[00:21:49.648 --> 00:21:50.488]  What do you think?
[00:21:50.568 --> 00:21:53.529]  The government may be fueling these somehow?
[00:21:54.169 --> 00:21:57.010]  Do they have the ability to play with our weather system to make this happen?
[00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:59.471]  I mean, we all know... Yeah, that goes back to the chemtrail question.
[00:21:59.491 --> 00:21:59.671]  Right?
[00:21:59.791 --> 00:22:00.991]  And I have news for you.
[00:22:03.223 --> 00:22:04.404]  I am going to Colorado.
[00:22:05.205 --> 00:22:06.667]  I have not even announced this.
[00:22:07.247 --> 00:22:14.675]  Three or four months ago, I promised my son that I would take him to Colorado because he's been reading about it and wants to go there.
[00:22:15.856 --> 00:22:19.119]  And also, there's all this hysteria and fear over 5-6 fires.
[00:22:19.319 --> 00:22:22.002]  It's like when you have fires in Dallas, do you leave Texas?
[00:22:22.602 --> 00:22:26.967]  I mean, the reason it's such big news is that they're lined up.
[00:22:28.902 --> 00:22:32.365]  By Boulder, by Denver, and by Colorado Springs, all in one line.
[00:22:32.385 --> 00:22:41.652]  But here's the state, square, and there's a couple fires from Denver down to Colorado Springs, and there's a couple here in the south and one in the middle.
[00:22:42.553 --> 00:22:46.756]  And I will never get within about 100 miles of the fires.
[00:22:47.585 --> 00:22:48.105]  Probably was.
[00:22:48.466 --> 00:22:50.807]  And my grandmother's like, oh my god, don't go to Colorado.
[00:22:51.088 --> 00:22:53.650]  Well, the news is showing you where the fires are.
[00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:55.391]  And so there's no perspective.
[00:22:55.931 --> 00:22:57.532]  You know, it's like, get off planet Earth!
[00:22:57.993 --> 00:23:03.817]  There's aboriginal natives in New Guinea that will eat you.
[00:23:04.898 --> 00:23:07.100]  And it's like, but it's all the way over there.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:10.022]  I mean, you know, it's 10,000 miles away.
[00:23:10.482 --> 00:23:14.265]  Well, as far as fires are, if you're 100 miles away from one,
[00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:16.322]  I think you're pretty, you're pretty in the clear.
[00:23:16.422 --> 00:23:17.243]  I mean, here's an example.
[00:23:17.383 --> 00:23:20.367]  They had really bad fires and a bunch of Bastrop burned.
[00:23:20.827 --> 00:23:25.113]  And then where I live outside Austin, there was fires like, you know, six, seven miles away.
[00:23:25.634 --> 00:23:31.080]  And sometimes you could smell the smoke and, but I mean, and families like, well, should we get out of here?
[00:23:31.101 --> 00:23:32.622]  And it's like, no, you know.
[00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:36.972]  If the fires come toward us, we have like three or four escape routes.
[00:23:37.453 --> 00:23:39.936]  It's not like, oh my god, it's the end of the world.
[00:23:40.937 --> 00:23:41.777]  Fires are going to get us.
[00:23:41.818 --> 00:23:47.604]  But yes, while I'm there now, I can report, check out any chemtrail action for people.
[00:23:47.624 --> 00:23:50.867]  But I'm going because some of my family was like, oh my god, you can't go.
[00:23:50.887 --> 00:23:51.988]  And I'm like, watch, I'm going to go.
[00:23:52.389 --> 00:23:53.930]  And the real danger is driving down the road.
[00:23:54.671 --> 00:23:56.872]  That's statistically one of the number one causes of death.
[00:23:56.952 --> 00:23:57.853]  It's not the fires.
[00:23:57.873 --> 00:24:04.036]  I think a couple people died, and it's terrible if you're who died, but hundreds of thousands die here in car accidents.
[00:24:04.076 --> 00:24:06.817]  So what's dangerous is car accidents, not the fires.
[00:24:07.077 --> 00:24:12.020]  But one of the users actually said, remember when you were talking about the Russian troops in Colorado?
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:13.761]  Do you think there's a tie-in at all?
[00:24:14.301 --> 00:24:20.184]  They did have Russian troops to do some drills out there, which was unprecedented to have them publicly doing it.
[00:24:20.224 --> 00:24:21.705]  But no, listen.
[00:24:23.373 --> 00:24:25.014]  There's always been big prairie fires.
[00:24:25.094 --> 00:24:25.955]  That's always happened.
[00:24:25.995 --> 00:24:27.196]  It's part of regeneration.
[00:24:27.576 --> 00:24:28.677]  Lightning always caused it.
[00:24:29.097 --> 00:24:33.281]  The difference was now, when there is lightning strikes, they go and put it out.
[00:24:34.001 --> 00:24:37.104]  So the big fires never get going to burn out all the dead wood.
[00:24:37.144 --> 00:24:41.927]  And they don't let people cut down fire breaks on the highways of old dead wood.
[00:24:42.348 --> 00:24:43.889]  They don't let them clean out these forests.
[00:24:44.029 --> 00:24:45.350]  So that's making it a lot worse.
[00:24:46.471 --> 00:24:48.553]  So there's a lot of things, but there's always been fires.
[00:24:49.482 --> 00:24:52.804]  Yeah, I mean, Al Gore is on the news saying, look, there's fires, pay me money now.
[00:24:53.785 --> 00:24:56.767]  The sea levels are rising, that's why I just bought a big palace on the ocean.
[00:24:56.907 --> 00:24:57.107]  Right.
[00:24:57.568 --> 00:24:58.948]  We're all dead, it's over.
[00:24:59.329 --> 00:25:00.650]  Things like that aren't the issue.
[00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:03.892]  Fukushima blowing up, that's an issue, and them saying radiation's not a problem.
[00:25:04.292 --> 00:25:06.834]  Or GMO food we're eating every day, or fluoride in our water.
[00:25:07.174 --> 00:25:10.837]  Or vaccines and autism from one in, you know, 25,000 to one in 58.
[00:25:11.457 --> 00:25:16.741]  That's the, statistically, but again, everybody, like I said, scared when they go swimming, a shark's gonna get them.
[00:25:17.061 --> 00:25:17.241]  Right.
[00:25:17.401 --> 00:25:20.543]  I mean, I gotta admit, I could be swimming around a lake, and I'm like, I wonder if there are crocodiles down there.
[00:25:20.563 --> 00:25:22.225]  Even though there aren't crocodiles around here.
[00:25:22.245 --> 00:25:24.586]  You're real curious, like, here, crocky, crocky.
[00:25:24.786 --> 00:25:29.390]  Well, no, I mean, you know, you ever gone and jumped in a lake by yourself, you're swimming, and you're kind of like, eh.
[00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:31.831]  I mean, I should have thought twice.
[00:25:31.992 --> 00:25:37.616]  Well, no, but it's real clear, and there's like an old, you know, submerged log or something, it looks like something, and you're like, what is that?
[00:25:37.736 --> 00:25:42.059]  You know, or you turn, there's like a... One time, I, uh...
[00:25:44.045 --> 00:25:46.347]  I was swimming around in the lake.
[00:25:46.367 --> 00:25:47.228]  It was real still.
[00:25:48.009 --> 00:25:50.611]  And I looked over and it was about an eight foot alligator gar.
[00:25:50.651 --> 00:25:53.393]  And let me tell you, that was creepy because it looks like a sea monster going into the water.
[00:25:53.493 --> 00:25:53.854]  Oh yeah.
[00:25:54.114 --> 00:25:57.637]  And they've got big, long, a lot of teeth, but they don't attack humans.
[00:25:59.799 --> 00:26:00.640]  Plus it's accidental.
[00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:05.123]  There's a few cases of people out in a float and their fingers, like a giant barracuda.
[00:26:05.284 --> 00:26:05.984]  No, I'm good.
[00:26:06.565 --> 00:26:07.546]  I'll stay on the raft.
[00:26:08.746 --> 00:26:10.868]  Alright, the next question comes to you from Timothy.
[00:26:11.528 --> 00:26:13.569]  He references Rwanda in 1994.
[00:26:13.789 --> 00:26:17.891]  The Tutsi people, 800,000 decry law.
[00:26:19.252 --> 00:26:22.474]  They told them they had to register their guns, their ammunition, everything.
[00:26:22.494 --> 00:26:23.254]  And then they murdered them.
[00:26:23.494 --> 00:26:24.235]  And then they murdered them.
[00:26:24.315 --> 00:26:25.556]  And the UN sat around and helped do it.
[00:26:25.816 --> 00:26:32.459]  And then it was on our news that the UN was over there helping, but later came out the UN was slaughtering them because they were the ruling class and they wanted to take their property.
[00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:36.822]  Well, his question is, is that what it's looking like it's going to be here?
[00:26:37.984 --> 00:26:43.427]  Yeah, the globalists would like a total collapse re-education type deal here, but there's so many guns they're not going to get away with it.
[00:26:43.767 --> 00:26:43.967]  Good.
[00:26:44.247 --> 00:26:44.488]  Good.
[00:26:44.568 --> 00:26:45.048]  Nice answer.
[00:26:45.468 --> 00:26:48.030]  Alright, this last one is really to end it off.
[00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:49.310]  Thank you, Christopher.
[00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:50.071]  This comes to you.
[00:26:50.111 --> 00:26:52.092]  It says, are you coming to the Grove this year?
[00:26:52.712 --> 00:26:53.973]  Referencing Bohemian Grove.
[00:26:54.313 --> 00:26:55.133]  And he says, let me know.
[00:26:55.814 --> 00:26:59.496]  I go there often and I may be able to help if you and others attend to make the trip.
[00:27:00.036 --> 00:27:02.598]  And we also might be able to offer hospitality.
[00:27:02.738 --> 00:27:05.579]  It's not really a question more than just I wanted to insert that in.
[00:27:05.599 --> 00:27:06.900]  I thought that was a nice token.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:10.502]  Yeah, no, I won't be able to go out to the Bohemian Grove this year.
[00:27:12.443 --> 00:27:13.303]  In 2000, I infiltrated it.
[00:27:13.403 --> 00:27:20.546]  A couple years ago, with History Channel, I went, but locals wanted to help, and then just reported we were going there.
[00:27:20.566 --> 00:27:23.668]  And I was like, I told History Channel, I said, you know that guy's a spy.
[00:27:24.048 --> 00:27:25.269]  They're like, oh, there's not spies.
[00:27:25.289 --> 00:27:27.069]  And then they were waiting for us when we got there.
[00:27:27.089 --> 00:27:28.650]  I'm not saying this guy's saying that.
[00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:29.651]  Right.
[00:27:29.851 --> 00:27:32.312]  But if I was going, I wouldn't tell you I was going.
[00:27:32.672 --> 00:27:32.892]  Gotcha.
[00:27:32.912 --> 00:27:34.453]  Even though I'm going to be going out west.
[00:27:35.339 --> 00:27:35.779]  On RV?
[00:27:35.819 --> 00:27:36.119]  No, no.
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:37.600]  I'm not going to Bohemian Grove.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:38.701]  Okay.
[00:27:39.662 --> 00:27:43.304]  In fact, I should be back even before it even kicks off.
[00:27:43.764 --> 00:27:44.664]  I am going out to Colorado.
[00:27:45.145 --> 00:27:45.365]  Cool.
[00:27:45.765 --> 00:27:46.245]  Very cool.
[00:27:46.506 --> 00:27:47.786]  But everybody else should go out there.
[00:27:48.267 --> 00:27:48.947]  Yeah, why not?
[00:27:49.147 --> 00:27:50.408]  Yeah, Christopher, what's stopping you?
[00:27:50.448 --> 00:27:51.448]  You're already there.
[00:27:51.468 --> 00:27:53.410]  You're already familiar with it apparently.
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.320]  Alright, well, thank you, Alex Jones.
[00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:57.160]  I appreciate your time.
[00:27:57.201 --> 00:27:59.161]  He's a very busy man, so we're very... Oh, come on!
[00:27:59.181 --> 00:28:00.541]  That's why I'm here, is to talk to people.
[00:28:00.901 --> 00:28:02.601]  And I like the idea that listeners had.
[00:28:02.821 --> 00:28:07.062]  Was it your idea, or the listeners, the users of PlanetInfoWars to do this?
[00:28:07.762 --> 00:28:08.703]  It was my idea.
[00:28:09.003 --> 00:28:09.843]  Well, it's a good idea.
[00:28:10.143 --> 00:28:11.323]  This is the fourth one.
[00:28:12.963 --> 00:28:17.984]  And you can watch it all at PrisonPlanet.tv, and we want to see your questions in the group.
[00:28:18.384 --> 00:28:19.845]  They're at PlanetInfoWars.com.
[00:28:20.065 --> 00:28:21.265]  Absolutely.
[00:28:21.325 --> 00:28:22.165]  And until next time...
[00:28:23.117 --> 00:28:23.919]  Thank you very much.
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:24.942]  See you next time.
[00:28:25.162 --> 00:28:25.723]  Great questions.
