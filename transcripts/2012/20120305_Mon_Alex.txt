[00:00:04.997 --> 00:00:06.297]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.297 --> 00:00:08.058]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.058 --> 00:00:09.818]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.818 --> 00:00:11.418]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.418 --> 00:00:12.958]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:17.159]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:23.620]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.401]  And we are off!
[00:00:25.401 --> 00:00:28.541]  Another global transmission.
[00:00:28.541 --> 00:00:30.962]  Blasting out against tyranny.
[00:00:30.962 --> 00:00:32.782]  Worldwide, a clarion call.
[00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:52.801]  The 21st century Paul Reveres across the globe are riding not for just liberty here in the United States but 1776 freedom worldwide against the crony anti-free market globalists, the monopoly men that are waging war against every
[00:00:54.523 --> 00:00:55.864]  Sector of free society.
[00:00:55.864 --> 00:01:00.466]  Well, we've got an extremely jam-packed transmission for you today.
[00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:08.569]  Colonel Anthony Schaeffer is going to be joining us to talk about the Iran situation, the Syria situation, the Libya situation.
[00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:15.692]  Of course, he ran Operation Stratus Ivy in able danger and could have killed Osama bin Laden back in 2000-2001 and was ordered to stand down.
[00:01:23.038 --> 00:01:23.118]  I'm
[00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.745]  Part of my speech I gave in Dallas, and then later in the week we're going to put out the Orlando speech.
[00:01:59.745 --> 00:02:03.649]  And the Dallas speech was powerful, but I think the Orlando was even more powerful in ways.
[00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.251]  That's at least what my crew said.
[00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:13.871]  And so we're going to be airing that as well on the Nightly News in its entirety in a few days, and then here on the radio we'll play some snippets of that.
[00:02:13.871 --> 00:02:23.117]  I will, in the next few days, have a big Dave Mustaine interview for you, but we've taped part of that interview, and then we're going to tape some more with him.
[00:02:23.117 --> 00:02:25.019]  Really a wide-ranging interview.
[00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.462]  So that is coming up in the next few days.
[00:02:30.566 --> 00:02:40.363]  And we'll premiere that here on the radio slash TV show at least part of it and then the rest of it on the nightly news.
[00:02:40.363 --> 00:02:43.268]  And he'll be able to clarify a lot of the things he's been talking about lately.
[00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:51.475]  I've known Dave for years and talked to him on the phone quite a bit and in person some, but just really getting to know him.
[00:02:51.475 --> 00:02:57.380]  He's an amazing guy and really a nice, caring person.
[00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:03.585]  His wife's just a really nice person and it's great to be able to spend some time with him.
[00:03:03.585 --> 00:03:05.547]  But that is a side issue.
[00:03:05.547 --> 00:03:07.208]  Boy, I had a wild night Saturday.
[00:03:07.208 --> 00:03:11.752]  Went to the show here in Austin and then driving out to my house.
[00:03:12.853 --> 00:03:28.444]  Later if I have time I'm going to tell a story getting pulled over with Dave Mustaine and his wife in the car and then literally getting into the house 30 seconds before coast-to-coast AM called with Mr. Wells who did a great job on his show.
[00:03:28.444 --> 00:03:29.705]  I've been up since about 5 in the morning.
[00:03:29.705 --> 00:03:32.908]  I hope I did a good job on coast-to-coast covering the Breitbart situation.
[00:03:32.908 --> 00:03:34.609]  By the way, speaking of that,
[00:03:36.854 --> 00:03:39.497]  The coroner's come out and said six to eight weeks, as you know, three days ago.
[00:03:39.497 --> 00:03:42.119]  But now they're saying, yeah, they're going to look at foul play.
[00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:43.941]  All bases will be covered.
[00:03:43.941 --> 00:03:57.794]  Because the coroner obviously thinks it's suspicious that they were going to release this quote, damning footage of Obama at communist meetings and palling around with known bombers and others.
[00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:05.093]  And that he said he was going to bring down Obama, and then you know pretty much what happened to him.
[00:04:05.093 --> 00:04:06.475]  Saying that he was going to vet him.
[00:04:06.475 --> 00:04:09.898]  You'd be a fool not to question.
[00:04:09.898 --> 00:04:26.592]  And I saw in the, well in Yahoo News, and in British newspapers, and in the Washington Times of all places, in their communities area, Social Journalism and Independent Voices, one of their columnists,
[00:04:28.308 --> 00:04:34.873]  It's ask a question of this writer is the name of the column.
[00:04:34.873 --> 00:04:38.356]  And they say, Breitbart murder, now pass the Kool-Aid.
[00:04:38.356 --> 00:04:44.020]  Kool-Aid is like being in a cult and not questioning.
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:50.645]  I mean, you're called a conspiracy theorist when you question known liars.
[00:04:50.645 --> 00:04:53.548]  So if that means I'm a Kool-Aid drinker, okay.
[00:04:54.687 --> 00:04:56.512]  Then pass the grape Kool-Aid.
[00:04:56.512 --> 00:04:58.238]  Because I just don't buy what I'm told.
[00:04:58.238 --> 00:04:59.180]  Big show coming up.
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.521]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:07.656]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[00:05:07.656 --> 00:05:25.562]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:05:25.562 --> 00:05:29.664]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[00:05:29.944 --> 00:05:31.705]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[00:05:31.705 --> 00:05:39.871]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[00:05:39.871 --> 00:05:46.195]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[00:05:46.195 --> 00:05:47.476]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:05:47.476 --> 00:05:48.356]  It's incredible.
[00:05:48.356 --> 00:05:57.563]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[00:05:57.563 --> 00:05:59.424]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[00:06:00.244 --> 00:06:04.788]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:04.788 --> 00:06:09.132]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:09.132 --> 00:06:14.876]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:14.876 --> 00:06:15.617]  It's true.
[00:06:15.617 --> 00:06:20.181]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:20.481 --> 00:06:21.302]  Number 3.
[00:06:21.302 --> 00:06:24.886]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:24.886 --> 00:06:28.810]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:29.611]  Number 4.
[00:06:29.611 --> 00:06:32.374]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:32.374 --> 00:06:35.718]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:36.038 --> 00:06:40.983]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:40.983 --> 00:06:46.028]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:46.028 --> 00:06:50.212]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:50.212 --> 00:06:51.993]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:51.993 --> 00:06:56.598]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:07:01.209 --> 00:07:02.931]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:02.931 --> 00:07:08.236]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:07:08.236 --> 00:07:09.778]  Saving means to make money.
[00:07:09.778 --> 00:07:18.566]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:07:19.287 --> 00:07:26.831]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:07:26.831 --> 00:07:34.835]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:07:34.835 --> 00:07:40.058]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:07:40.058 --> 00:07:42.219]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.301]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:46.301 --> 00:07:48.364]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.023 --> 00:08:19.306]  It is Monday, March 5th, 2012, and we're going to be here for the next three hours today.
[00:08:19.306 --> 00:08:23.908]  Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer on Iran, Syria, and more.
[00:08:23.908 --> 00:08:27.149]  He's going to be joining us with the Inside Scoop in the next hour.
[00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:29.710]  Then we have a guest joining us from Syria.
[00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:34.592]  She just goes by Syrian Girl to give us their take on what's actually happening there.
[00:08:34.592 --> 00:08:37.693]  We're going to be breaking it all down today.
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:42.402]  Wow, where to start?
[00:08:42.402 --> 00:08:48.486]  Obama has come out and said, I will not hesitate in using force to block Iran's nuclear threat from Iran.
[00:08:49.707 --> 00:08:53.208]  Proxy wars are being launched against Syria, Libya.
[00:08:53.208 --> 00:08:55.049]  They've already overthrown Libya and Egypt.
[00:08:55.049 --> 00:08:58.430]  They're putting Al-Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood in charge.
[00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:03.851]  They're trying to get rid of Assad and put Al-Qaeda and Muslim Brotherhood in charge on record.
[00:09:03.851 --> 00:09:11.874]  The West is shipping arms in on record and now admits they want to start a bombardment that they call a peace bombardment of Syria.
[00:09:11.874 --> 00:09:17.796]  And they'll call the humanitarian the, undoubtedly, well there's been upwards of 40,000 killed in Libya.
[00:09:18.965 --> 00:09:22.209]  Racial cleansing going on by the Arab groups.
[00:09:22.209 --> 00:09:25.633]  Al-Qaeda backed against the black Libyans.
[00:09:25.633 --> 00:09:30.158]  All of this is going on and we're told, oh it's democracy, it's an uprising.
[00:09:30.933 --> 00:09:48.785]  That'd be like if the globalists, the UN, funded, let's say, Mexican nationals through the La Reconquista, La Infrasora movement that's funded at the university level by the big banks to create division, divide and conquer, you know, to try to overthrow the Southwest and break part of the country off.
[00:09:50.086 --> 00:09:53.049]  That's actually being taught, being pushed.
[00:09:53.049 --> 00:10:01.817]  And then Russia came over here, or China, and was bombing the United States because the government was trying to keep the Union together and saying, no, this is the United States.
[00:10:01.817 --> 00:10:05.040]  I mean, that's the type of stuff we're talking about here.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.263]  And Syria is not being attacked, and civil war is not being stirred.
[00:10:09.263 --> 00:10:14.808]  And they've got members of the Syrian military, of course, that have been paid off and have defected.
[00:10:14.808 --> 00:10:16.009]  I mean, it's a war.
[00:10:16.843 --> 00:10:20.346]  Just like it was a war when they brought Al-Qaeda in to attack Gaddafi.
[00:10:20.346 --> 00:10:22.047]  I'm not a fan of Gaddafi.
[00:10:22.047 --> 00:10:23.388]  Rest in peace.
[00:10:23.388 --> 00:10:27.170]  But compared to Al-Qaeda, I mean, he was a stabilizing force.
[00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:38.899]  Sure, 20 years ago, you know, he was using asymmetrical warfare against the West, trying to basically use guerrilla warfare against overwhelming force.
[00:10:38.899 --> 00:10:39.679]  And I'm an American.
[00:10:39.679 --> 00:10:40.440]  I don't like that.
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:44.743]  But the point is, is that he was also under attack.
[00:10:44.743 --> 00:10:45.604]  So he was responding.
[00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:54.212]  And now he came in seven years ago, did deals with the West, gave up his weapons programs, invested his money in big U.S.
[00:10:54.212 --> 00:11:05.115]  and European banks, hung out with presidents and prime ministers, let all the Western industry in, and they just used that to come in and infiltrate with spy organizations.
[00:11:05.115 --> 00:11:09.236]  So, this is a serious situation.
[00:11:09.236 --> 00:11:10.916]  It's the same thing with Russia.
[00:11:10.916 --> 00:11:14.257]  I know Russia's KGB and now FSB run.
[00:11:15.291 --> 00:11:17.753]  I know it's got all of its own problems.
[00:11:17.753 --> 00:11:20.595]  I know there's election fraud classically there.
[00:11:20.595 --> 00:11:25.338]  But I'm not naive enough to say, oh, but that's not happening in the United States.
[00:11:25.338 --> 00:11:34.704]  And watch our supposed corporate media sit there and tell us that, oh, well, Russian elections are a fraud, but not ours.
[00:11:34.704 --> 00:11:40.869]  None of that goes on here, where there was clear fraud in Maine, Iowa, 100%, and 90-plus percent proven in Nevada.
[00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:48.272]  South Carolina and other areas.
[00:11:48.272 --> 00:11:49.693]  So now we knew this was coming.
[00:11:49.693 --> 00:12:06.965]  The West and the banks that have hijacked our nation and have hijacked Europe and England are now openly with color revolution groups and George Soros organizations openly trying to overthrow Russia and cause a civil war there.
[00:12:06.965 --> 00:12:10.308]  And folks, the Russians have got 10,000 plus nuclear weapons.
[00:12:11.391 --> 00:12:14.972]  And the Russian military is not going to go along with this.
[00:12:14.972 --> 00:12:27.597]  The West already, back in 2008, on the day the Olympics began, NATO-backed groups out of Georgia attacked Russian-held areas of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
[00:12:27.597 --> 00:12:30.518]  And our media ran a hoax saying Russia had attacked, and I went
[00:12:31.787 --> 00:12:39.195]  On air for the first hour or so and said, I can't believe Russia attacked these areas just because I couldn't believe CNN would lie like that.
[00:12:39.195 --> 00:12:40.156]  But then it started coming out.
[00:12:40.156 --> 00:12:41.036]  Wait a minute.
[00:12:41.036 --> 00:12:47.062]  NATO attacked and they slaughtered the Russians in their barracks and then the Russians rolled in with nukes.
[00:12:47.062 --> 00:12:52.848]  When NATO aircraft were landing to with US and NATO troops to fight the Russians and the Russian
[00:12:53.942 --> 00:12:59.746]  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff came out and said, OK, we've moved in intermediate nukes, we're going to fire on you.
[00:12:59.746 --> 00:13:03.949]  This was in European TV, on Russian TV, nothing in U.S.
[00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:05.390]  television.
[00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:11.214]  And then the Georgians pulled back, NATO pulled back, but that's how close we came to war again.
[00:13:11.214 --> 00:13:12.715]  The Russians did not blink.
[00:13:12.715 --> 00:13:18.760]  They rolled in nuclear weapons and rolled in heavy armor.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:19.100]  On record.
[00:13:20.208 --> 00:13:24.229]  And I've learned just from three and a half, four years ago.
[00:13:24.229 --> 00:13:26.150]  It's always a learning process.
[00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:36.053]  I mean, I turn on the TV, it's 7, 8 in the morning, and there's the president of Georgia saying, we're under attack from Russia, and the news is Russian tanks are pouring in for no reason.
[00:13:36.053 --> 00:13:41.615]  And I, by 11, I'd heard, it was conflicting reports, but I said, well, there's no way they're lying.
[00:13:41.615 --> 00:13:45.517]  Wow, Russia attacked Georgia.
[00:13:45.517 --> 00:13:48.898]  And then I looked like a fool a few hours later, it was all over the European press everywhere.
[00:13:48.898 --> 00:13:49.458]  No, actually,
[00:13:50.697 --> 00:13:55.139]  In the middle of the night, they attacked these two areas, went into the UN zones where the Russians are at.
[00:13:55.139 --> 00:14:00.561]  This has been a disputed zone since the end of World War II, and just killed them.
[00:14:00.561 --> 00:14:08.824]  And then later, that was all confirmed, you know, in scholarly reports, and even our media about a week later had to admit it, but... This is craziness!
[00:14:08.824 --> 00:14:10.965]  This is craziness!
[00:14:10.965 --> 00:14:17.007]  To have this type of stuff going on, and the Russians sent mobile missile launchers.
[00:14:17.007 --> 00:14:17.967]  Mobile, medium range.
[00:14:17.967 --> 00:14:19.208]  You know, those big trucks with the big...
[00:14:20.854 --> 00:14:29.741]  Nukes on the back and went on, I mean we played the clips here, went on Russian national TV and said we're preparing to use nuclear weapons.
[00:14:29.741 --> 00:14:36.886]  I mean, and they were aiming them at those bases where US troops were landing.
[00:14:36.886 --> 00:14:39.228]  And the Russians would have pulled the trigger.
[00:14:39.228 --> 00:14:41.350]  Guaranteed nuclear war.
[00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:44.312]  Boom.
[00:14:44.312 --> 00:14:45.093]  That's how it starts.
[00:14:48.581 --> 00:14:50.563]  I mean, didn't Napoleon learn?
[00:14:50.563 --> 00:14:51.585]  Didn't Hitler learn?
[00:14:51.585 --> 00:15:04.200]  Just look, the Russians have got all their technology mixed with, you know, primitive, dark age type stuff, medieval, and
[00:15:06.176 --> 00:15:07.577]  It's insanity.
[00:15:07.577 --> 00:15:11.881]  The top Chinese generals said six months ago they're preparing for war with the U.S.
[00:15:11.881 --> 00:15:13.162]  They've never openly talked like that.
[00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:17.145]  Then the president two months ago said we're preparing for nuclear war.
[00:15:17.145 --> 00:15:18.886]  This is who holds two trillion dollars of our debt.
[00:15:18.886 --> 00:15:21.968]  This is where all our industry has been shipped with tax incentives.
[00:15:21.968 --> 00:15:25.911]  And the globalists are playing America off against the Chinese and the Russians.
[00:15:25.911 --> 00:15:27.893]  And then we all lose.
[00:15:27.893 --> 00:15:29.454]  We all lose.
[00:15:29.454 --> 00:15:32.597]  It's the bankers that are trying to lobby to take our Second Amendment.
[00:15:33.397 --> 00:15:38.119]  It's the globalists that are lobbying to overthrow the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:15:38.119 --> 00:15:41.480]  It's the globalists that are the main threat.
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.020]  I'm not a fan of the Communist Chinese.
[00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:46.802]  I hate them, and constantly talk about how horrible they are.
[00:15:46.802 --> 00:15:51.463]  And the bankers are in bed with them at a certain level, but they all stab each other in the back.
[00:15:51.463 --> 00:15:55.865]  I don't like the stuff Russia does, killing journalists and all the rest of it.
[00:15:56.684 --> 00:15:59.025]  But the point is, Russia's not over here.
[00:15:59.025 --> 00:16:01.605]  Russia's not signing the NDAA.
[00:16:01.605 --> 00:16:04.006]  Russia's not launching wars without congressional approval.
[00:16:04.006 --> 00:16:10.687]  Russia's not shipping guns into Mexico to blame my Second Amendment and your Second Amendment.
[00:16:10.687 --> 00:16:22.149]  And again, George Soros, who funds all these color revolutions all around Russia, and then NATO comes in and moves weapons in to try to start a new war with Russia.
[00:16:22.149 --> 00:16:24.430]  And now this same guy trying to overthrow my country,
[00:16:26.206 --> 00:16:33.836]  Well, the fake socialist revolution is trying to overthrow Russia, and that's in the news today.
[00:16:33.836 --> 00:16:42.587]  And so this is going to get the Russians completely into an offensive stance via defense against the West.
[00:16:45.276 --> 00:16:48.638]  And the truth is, Russia's gotten away from the New World Order.
[00:16:48.638 --> 00:16:51.059]  It's its own criminal enterprise, all these governments.
[00:16:51.059 --> 00:16:52.460]  Iran's its own criminal enterprise.
[00:16:52.460 --> 00:17:04.626]  See, people seem to think, well, is it Russia good, America bad, or is it America good, Russia bad, or is it Iran good, America bad, or Iran good, America, you know, Israel, all this.
[00:17:04.626 --> 00:17:07.387]  It's kleptocracies.
[00:17:07.387 --> 00:17:10.008]  Corrupt governments all use the same tricks.
[00:17:10.008 --> 00:17:13.010]  Governments are corrupt about 99% of the time, historically.
[00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:14.751]  Read what George Washington, Thomas Jefferson said.
[00:17:15.748 --> 00:17:25.534]  Read what Machiavelli wrote in two books 500 years ago in Italy or one of the provinces of one of the city-states that is now Italy today.
[00:17:25.534 --> 00:17:25.994]  The point is...
[00:17:28.243 --> 00:17:37.468]  That I understand how these powerful forces, these banks that create the money and now pretty much rule the world, are playing us off against each other.
[00:17:37.468 --> 00:17:40.170]  We'll all go in debt to fight with each other.
[00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:44.432]  Russia, as it's being attacked politically and militarily, will use that to take liberties.
[00:17:44.432 --> 00:17:48.715]  Iran, as it's being attacked by the globalists, will use that to take liberties and dig in deeper.
[00:17:49.764 --> 00:17:56.886]  The West, while it's in these cold wars and hot wars and economic currency wars with these other countries, that'll be used to take more liberties.
[00:17:56.886 --> 00:17:58.447]  Don't you get it?
[00:17:58.447 --> 00:18:15.593]  Whether it's Israel, whether it's Iran, whether it's China, the United States, Canada, all these governments and government class and the mega corporations and insider monopoly men that control governments, they stand to gain from war and crisis and terrorism.
[00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:26.557]  I've always explained that the Muslim extremists, there are Muslim extremists who hate America and hate Christians and all this, but that's a minority.
[00:18:26.557 --> 00:18:31.081]  And then when you go research them, they're the ones funded by the globalists.
[00:18:31.081 --> 00:18:32.342]  On record!
[00:18:32.342 --> 00:18:33.303]  Every time!
[00:18:33.303 --> 00:18:40.849]  And the government lets them come in, but then Europeans and people that want to immigrate here, it's almost impossible to even get a visa to come work here.
[00:18:42.418 --> 00:18:44.240]  Because it's all part of the Balkanization.
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.524]  This is the globalist great game of divide and conquer.
[00:18:47.524 --> 00:18:52.470]  It's what the Roman Empire used, then through the Dark Ages, the Venetians kept that system.
[00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:57.997]  After Rome fell, it went into the Byzantine Empire, was picked up later in France, and then it moved to England.
[00:18:57.997 --> 00:19:01.441]  And it's a management system developed by the Romans.
[00:19:02.509 --> 00:19:15.602]  Over the 300 year plus history, well, I mean, you've got the beginning of Rome going on for a couple hundred years and you've got the, you know, it's real rise for a few hundred years and then the slow disintegration that took 300 years.
[00:19:15.602 --> 00:19:20.807]  But, I mean, technically you could say the Roman Empire, Roman system went on for 600 years.
[00:19:20.807 --> 00:19:24.570]  But, and it came out of Greek systems.
[00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:24.751]  But,
[00:19:26.328 --> 00:19:29.613]  And so early on, it was Spartan and extremely moral.
[00:19:29.613 --> 00:19:31.896]  And then you saw what it degenerated into.
[00:19:31.896 --> 00:19:36.624]  The popularized image of Rome is what it degenerated into, not what it was.
[00:19:36.624 --> 00:19:37.345]  It was Spartan.
[00:19:38.922 --> 00:19:42.805]  It was like a Spartan graft into that area.
[00:19:42.805 --> 00:19:47.488]  All right, we're gonna come right back and get into news off the chart.
[00:19:47.488 --> 00:19:51.390]  There have been federal rulings that tie right into the NDAA.
[00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:53.371]  Hardcore news on Iran.
[00:19:53.371 --> 00:19:53.892]  So much.
[00:19:53.892 --> 00:19:55.413]  I will cover it all straight ahead.
[00:19:55.413 --> 00:19:57.574]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[00:19:57.574 --> 00:20:00.996]  We got some prizes, too, coming up.
[00:20:00.996 --> 00:20:03.578]  We all know the importance of having storable foods.
[00:20:03.578 --> 00:20:05.640]  But what about when the food runs out?
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.060]  What then?
[00:20:07.523 --> 00:20:10.864]  For real food independence, you need a supply of non-hybrid seeds.

[00:21:29.716 --> 00:21:39.022]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:21:39.022 --> 00:21:39.823]  This capitalism?
[00:21:39.823 --> 00:21:46.107]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:21:46.107 --> 00:21:46.968]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:46.968 --> 00:21:50.230]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[00:23:41.298 --> 00:23:43.059]  By the way, later in the broadcast,
[00:24:09.498 --> 00:24:13.842]  We're going to have an article about this at InfoWars.com.
[00:24:13.842 --> 00:24:20.347]  A auxiliary reporter of InfoWars, their YouTube channel is called Austin Streets.
[00:24:20.347 --> 00:24:22.930]  We're going to get this video up on InfoWars.com very soon.
[00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:28.875]  An auxiliary reporter who I gave some video cameras to a few years ago.
[00:24:30.277 --> 00:24:36.658]  Because he and his wife were literally homeless living on the street, and now they've gotten jobs and gotten back on their feet.
[00:24:36.658 --> 00:24:40.639]  But they were listeners and they came out to some events, so I gave them some cameras.
[00:24:40.639 --> 00:24:46.580]  And they shot at the Austin Kite Festival yesterday that I almost went to.
[00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:53.322]  The military, National Guard out there loading children onto buses and running security.
[00:24:53.322 --> 00:24:57.303]  Now, they've got MPs in San Antonio now at the Riverwalk.
[00:24:57.303 --> 00:24:58.323]  I have seen it myself.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.321]  They are doing crowd control.
[00:25:02.321 --> 00:25:07.705]  This is just all part of total acclimation to have military on the streets of America.
[00:25:07.705 --> 00:25:15.070]  And it's an admitted Pentagon program to put military on the streets, again, which is illegal, which means our country is basically being occupied.
[00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:21.254]  And they have these acclimation exercises to get you ready for martial law going on everywhere.
[00:25:21.254 --> 00:25:24.696]  And next, after they show up at events, there's the helicopters flying over.
[00:25:24.696 --> 00:25:27.238]  It's all part of conditioning.
[00:25:27.238 --> 00:25:27.618]  Next,
[00:25:29.295 --> 00:25:30.776]  They will start bag searching.
[00:25:30.776 --> 00:25:48.391]  I mean, I get reports every week where Alabama, Tennessee, California, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Vermont, I mean, they're all over YouTube, where people go to a high school basketball game and there's Marines with guns searching the kids, regular Marines.
[00:25:49.489 --> 00:25:51.751]  There's news articles I've had state reps on in Tennessee.
[00:25:51.751 --> 00:25:59.638]  You pull up, there's regular Marines, regular Army, TSA commanding them, state police barking at people, pulling people out of cars.
[00:25:59.638 --> 00:26:01.899]  It's all just martial law.
[00:26:01.899 --> 00:26:04.902]  That's what TSA at the airport grabbing your genitals is.
[00:26:04.902 --> 00:26:08.025]  And if you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, I just showed some of that video.
[00:26:08.025 --> 00:26:09.806]  Devastating.
[00:26:09.806 --> 00:26:11.648]  So I'm getting a hold of Paul Watson right now.
[00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:15.992]  And he does great boil-down articles.
[00:26:15.992 --> 00:26:17.493]  I won't just show you this.
[00:26:17.493 --> 00:26:24.198]  I'm going to show you the Washington Post, eight years ago, saying, during attacks, your children will be taken from the public schools.
[00:26:24.198 --> 00:26:27.720]  You'll be made to turn your guns in and come to a FEMA camp to get them.
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:38.107]  I knew about this because listeners in Missouri, in the Ozarks, sent us footage of the Army taking kids to a FEMA camp as part of a drill with the kids' hands up, being loaded.
[00:26:38.107 --> 00:26:42.350]  And then last year, we went to Denver during an urban warfare drill, not knowing what we would see.
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:47.604]  And it shows the kids being taken from public schools to the sports stadium.
[00:26:47.604 --> 00:26:50.707]  The Army, FEMA, everybody.
[00:26:50.707 --> 00:26:53.710]  So see, we won't just show you this latest thing in Austin.
[00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:57.173]  We'll give you background, integrated, full-spectrum analysis.
[00:26:57.173 --> 00:26:58.774]  In fact, I want to call Watson right now.
[00:26:58.774 --> 00:27:02.077]  McBrainer right before the show showed me the video, and I was watching it again during the break.
[00:27:02.077 --> 00:27:04.039]  It's just, it's pure evil.
[00:27:04.039 --> 00:27:06.721]  And again, whenever I talk about it, I'm going to be the bad guy.
[00:27:06.721 --> 00:27:08.062]  I said there'd be military on the streets.
[00:27:08.062 --> 00:27:08.443]  It happened.
[00:27:08.783 --> 00:27:10.144]  I said they'd get rid of positive commentators.
[00:27:10.144 --> 00:27:10.804]  It happened.
[00:27:10.804 --> 00:27:13.045]  I said they'd pass laws that could secretly disappear you.
[00:27:13.045 --> 00:27:13.725]  It happened.
[00:27:13.725 --> 00:27:21.749]  I said they'd announce a global bank of the world to fix a currency derivatives crisis 13, 14 years ago.
[00:27:21.749 --> 00:27:22.649]  By 2012.
[00:27:22.649 --> 00:27:24.550]  Happened exactly as I said.
[00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:26.671]  I broke down, I mean, just hundreds of issues.
[00:27:26.671 --> 00:27:28.872]  I've told you exactly what's going to happen.
[00:27:28.872 --> 00:27:32.874]  I told you a purge would start against Republican talk show hosts.
[00:27:32.874 --> 00:27:33.794]  Doesn't mean they're perfect.
[00:27:33.794 --> 00:27:35.475]  It just means there's a purge going on.
[00:27:35.475 --> 00:27:37.296]  They're now trumping up stuff on Limbaugh.
[00:27:38.216 --> 00:27:39.117]  Really going after him.
[00:27:39.117 --> 00:27:42.741]  New York Times and others trying to bring it down.
[00:27:42.741 --> 00:27:46.124]  Of course they're blackmailing Rupert Murdoch until arrest him and his son.
[00:27:46.124 --> 00:27:50.268]  The Justice Department openly is saying if he doesn't just roll over and start worshipping world government.
[00:27:50.268 --> 00:27:51.930]  Not say Rupert Murdoch's good.
[00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:54.192]  The point is it's factions fighting with each other.
[00:27:54.192 --> 00:27:55.794]  Breitbart dies.
[00:27:55.794 --> 00:27:57.876]  There's total demonization of drudge going on.
[00:27:58.695 --> 00:28:03.441]  Dirty tricks and just insane stuff being launched against us.
[00:28:03.441 --> 00:28:06.546]  Just total fiction frauds from every angle.
[00:28:06.546 --> 00:28:09.750]  Because it's all coming down.
[00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:15.758]  I mean, can you imagine out of all the hated people out there that, you know, at least are for the Bill of Rights, Constitution, Second Amendment?
[00:28:17.426 --> 00:28:18.688]  I'm the most hated.
[00:28:18.688 --> 00:28:22.952]  Michael Savage is broadcasting from six different locations with bodyguards hiding out.
[00:28:22.952 --> 00:28:26.036]  That is directly from inside sources.
[00:28:26.036 --> 00:28:28.359]  I knew it a year ago, heard it a few months ago, heard it again.
[00:28:28.359 --> 00:28:37.950]  And now Savage, I can talk about it because Savage is saying, I told Breitbart to get bodyguards and watch where he goes and don't be in public without bodyguards and don't go to the same places and everything because, you know.
[00:28:38.991 --> 00:28:40.391]  I'm not going to get into the other stuff I was told.
[00:28:40.391 --> 00:28:45.453]  It's too revealing about who the sources are, but this is real, okay?
[00:28:45.453 --> 00:28:47.453]  This is real, what's going on.
[00:28:47.453 --> 00:28:53.355]  You think they're just going to ship guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment, and then be caught in federal court shipping narcotics in?
[00:28:53.355 --> 00:28:57.816]  ATF, FBI, DEA, and five other agencies.
[00:28:57.816 --> 00:28:59.256]  I mean, this is in the federal courts.
[00:28:59.256 --> 00:29:00.557]  This is admitted.
[00:29:00.557 --> 00:29:03.357]  And when it's brought up, they declare national security.
[00:29:03.357 --> 00:29:04.998]  You think they've got the troops growing opium?
[00:29:05.799 --> 00:29:13.964]  And it's going from 10% of world supply to like 92% in just 10 years, with the troops growing it and guarding it, loading on C-130s.
[00:29:13.964 --> 00:29:16.085]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:29:16.085 --> 00:29:23.230]  And all you mainline Republicans who thought you were going to play along with the new world order, like Limbaugh.
[00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:24.270]  No, that's not going to happen.
[00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:26.032]  As this thing comes down to the line,
[00:29:27.251 --> 00:29:32.175]  All the old guard types who tried to play both sides, they're going to come after you.
[00:29:32.175 --> 00:29:35.438]  You could even try to join the New World Order now, they're going to destroy you.
[00:29:35.438 --> 00:29:37.659]  You better defend the Republic.
[00:29:37.659 --> 00:29:39.481]  Tyrannies aren't fun.
[00:29:39.481 --> 00:29:41.482]  Look at what happened in every other dictatorship.
[00:29:41.482 --> 00:29:46.066]  They go after their opposition, the powerful opposition, as soon as they take over.
[00:29:46.066 --> 00:29:49.869]  Do you want to be purged by Obama and the megabanks and George Soros?
[00:29:49.869 --> 00:29:51.270]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:53.812]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.812 --> 00:29:56.474]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:18.668]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:31:19.389 --> 00:31:26.933]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:31:26.933 --> 00:31:34.938]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:31:34.938 --> 00:31:40.160]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[00:31:59.833 --> 00:32:07.057]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[00:32:07.057 --> 00:32:24.947]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:32:24.947 --> 00:32:29.069]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[00:32:29.329 --> 00:32:31.110]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:39.276]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[00:32:46.861 --> 00:32:47.741]  It's incredible.

[00:32:59.189 --> 00:32:59.276]  Yeah.
[00:33:25.231 --> 00:33:32.278]  It blows me away that right here in my own town, the state police are calling my local affiliate trying to get us kicked off the air.
[00:33:32.278 --> 00:33:44.650]  The military is at the kite festival that I've gone to many times with my children, directing people around, bossing everyone around.
[00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:49.495]  The next time, of course, they're going to be going for the genitals.
[00:33:51.508 --> 00:33:52.229]  You're like, why?
[00:33:52.229 --> 00:33:55.832]  Well, just even with dogs, that's the ultimate form of domination.
[00:33:55.832 --> 00:34:00.637]  And they're there conditioning our military, who are good men and women, to engage in these unconstitutional activities.
[00:34:00.637 --> 00:34:03.720]  It's all about getting the police, the military, everybody ready.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:06.523]  I interviewed, 14 years ago now,
[00:34:09.386 --> 00:34:12.087]  That was 1997, more than 14 years ago.
[00:34:12.087 --> 00:34:23.372]  Al A. Philippus, the Chief of Police of San Antonio, who had the Delta Force come in with bags of money and try to buy him off to basically have a covert military takeover of San Antonio.
[00:34:23.372 --> 00:34:28.014]  First they buy off your police, just like they take over a third world country.
[00:34:28.014 --> 00:34:31.956]  It's a force multiplication structure.
[00:34:31.956 --> 00:34:38.019]  They were buying off other city officials, even after he said no, they brought them suitcases of cash.
[00:34:40.151 --> 00:34:42.052]  You know how special forces takes over a country?
[00:34:42.052 --> 00:34:43.032]  I mean, they're trained.
[00:34:43.032 --> 00:34:49.774]  They can parachute 20 of these guys in, and within six months, they've got an indigenous population eating out of their hand, ready to wage war.
[00:34:49.774 --> 00:34:53.095]  We are treated the same.
[00:34:53.095 --> 00:34:58.797]  And then I got contacted by... Both of these men were in military intelligence.
[00:34:58.797 --> 00:34:59.957]  That's why they knew what was happening.
[00:34:59.957 --> 00:35:01.838]  It totally freaked them out.
[00:35:01.838 --> 00:35:04.799]  Thomas Sanchez, the head of emergency management in Kingsville, Texas.
[00:35:05.799 --> 00:35:08.340]  Vietnam veteran, Army intelligence.
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:09.861]  And he knew what to say when they came to him.
[00:35:09.861 --> 00:35:11.982]  He said, is this part of a takeover program?
[00:35:11.982 --> 00:35:13.223]  And they said, yes.
[00:35:13.223 --> 00:35:19.707]  The president under these presidential directives is preparing us for martial law and taking over local government.
[00:35:19.707 --> 00:35:21.628]  And we want you to work with us on this.
[00:35:21.628 --> 00:35:23.429]  We're going to run acclimation operations.
[00:35:27.895 --> 00:35:33.997]  And of course, there's mayors and sheriffs and everybody listening everywhere going, wow, I was approached years ago and made to feel special.
[00:35:33.997 --> 00:35:36.678]  They always tell you, you're the first town this is being done.
[00:35:36.678 --> 00:35:37.898]  You're special.
[00:35:37.898 --> 00:35:38.878]  We've got to train.
[00:35:38.878 --> 00:35:41.479]  We've got to get everybody ready.
[00:35:41.479 --> 00:35:43.480]  It's the same M.O.
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:56.824]  And when I was covering the secret covert program, folks, I had the Army with firearms take our video in San Antonio after the police chief had told them not to do it.
[00:35:56.824 --> 00:35:57.264]  They did it at
[00:35:58.581 --> 00:36:04.946]  The military base, Fort Sam Houston, the medical center then, they had Delta Force come in and blow up part of the building and all this.
[00:36:04.946 --> 00:36:13.674]  We're there the next day, on an open base at the time, and they had guys come over with their sidearms, point them at us.
[00:36:13.674 --> 00:36:17.697]  Mike Hanson began to argue, so they pulled the gun out and pointed it right at them, MPs.
[00:36:17.697 --> 00:36:21.921]  Took his video, erased it and gave it back to us, and told us don't come back.
[00:36:22.827 --> 00:36:28.874]  With Delta Force guys sitting there and their handlers, older guys who are 45, 50, you know, laughing at us and stuff.
[00:36:28.874 --> 00:36:29.955]  Yeah, laugh at America.
[00:36:29.955 --> 00:36:30.876]  It's real funny what you do.
[00:36:31.755 --> 00:36:33.537]  All the narcotics trafficking, all of it.
[00:36:33.537 --> 00:36:37.561]  Oh, you're giving Machiavelli as your test to see if the end justifies the means.
[00:36:37.561 --> 00:36:39.703]  The end is not having America strong.
[00:36:39.703 --> 00:36:41.344]  The end is destroying America.
[00:36:41.344 --> 00:36:42.786]  You were lied to.
[00:36:42.786 --> 00:36:46.409]  You think you do evil things because you've got to be more evil than the evil guys?
[00:36:46.409 --> 00:36:48.732]  No, that's the devil's greatest trick.
[00:36:48.732 --> 00:36:50.894]  It's like the ring of Mordor.
[00:36:50.894 --> 00:36:53.036]  It cannot be used for good.
[00:36:56.169 --> 00:36:59.491]  And of course, that's just the weak-minded ones that get to be part of this evil.
[00:36:59.491 --> 00:37:01.832]  How do you feel Delta Force murdering the people at Waco?
[00:37:01.832 --> 00:37:03.393]  Is that real tough?
[00:37:03.393 --> 00:37:04.534]  Did you kill some toddlers?
[00:37:04.534 --> 00:37:07.335]  Well, yeah, you're real men.
[00:37:07.335 --> 00:37:12.959]  You'll go in and put an anti-personnel mine-shaped charge on top of the church records building and kill the kids inside?
[00:37:12.959 --> 00:37:18.442]  You know, it's an order from Janet Reno, that insane bucket of pus.
[00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:21.681]  This is who you've become.
[00:37:21.681 --> 00:37:24.683]  And the military is full of some of the best people we've got.
[00:37:24.683 --> 00:37:27.985]  And the question is, now the system's trying to corrupt all of them.
[00:37:27.985 --> 00:37:31.708]  Now the system's trying to get them all to join with this evil.
[00:37:31.708 --> 00:37:35.830]  And listen, I've got a message for the military and the police and everybody.
[00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:37.651]  This whole world government's real.
[00:37:37.651 --> 00:37:39.473]  The bad guys have seized the federal government.
[00:37:39.473 --> 00:37:41.054]  Now they're seizing the state governments.
[00:37:41.054 --> 00:37:44.236]  And you better make a decision which side you're going to be on right now.
[00:37:45.151 --> 00:37:46.912]  The world government's out in the open.
[00:37:46.912 --> 00:37:49.133]  The destruction of our rights is out in the open.
[00:37:49.133 --> 00:37:51.955]  Everything I told you so far has come true.
[00:37:51.955 --> 00:37:54.036]  Are you ready for the rest of it?
[00:37:54.036 --> 00:38:02.421]  And I'm going to tell all of the big talk show hosts and all the big libertarian type people and the neocons and the rest of it.
[00:38:02.421 --> 00:38:05.383]  You're not going to have a seat at the table in this new world order.
[00:38:06.584 --> 00:38:08.166]  People like Matt Drudge have figured that out.
[00:38:08.166 --> 00:38:14.435]  That's why for like three, four years he's covering Bilderberg, New World Order, you know, not being in public anymore.
[00:38:14.435 --> 00:38:15.717]  He's awake.
[00:38:15.717 --> 00:38:16.758]  Other people are awake.
[00:38:16.758 --> 00:38:19.422]  Michael Savage, love him or hate him, he knows what's going on.
[00:38:19.422 --> 00:38:21.545]  He's eyed now.
[00:38:21.545 --> 00:38:21.805]  Okay?
[00:38:22.737 --> 00:38:27.022]  Limbaugh, they're in the process of trying to destroy him, blowing all the stuff out of proportion right now.
[00:38:27.022 --> 00:38:30.046]  I told you, get ready for them to come after everybody.
[00:38:30.046 --> 00:38:30.887]  In fact, guys, pull it up.
[00:38:30.887 --> 00:38:32.288]  I forgot to tell you during the break.
[00:38:32.288 --> 00:38:40.758]  It was Politico, Media Matters, you know, said the Media Matters memo leaked.
[00:38:40.758 --> 00:38:42.059]  And Media Matters admitted it was their memo.
[00:38:42.955 --> 00:38:50.559]  And they said, we're going to infiltrate alternative media, talk radio, Fox News, and our enemies list, which I'm on.
[00:38:50.559 --> 00:38:51.860]  They attack me every week.
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:54.041]  And we're going to infiltrate them and destroy them.
[00:38:54.041 --> 00:38:56.322]  We're going to destroy them.
[00:38:56.322 --> 00:39:00.244]  Sabotage.
[00:39:00.244 --> 00:39:02.705]  Sabotage.
[00:39:02.705 --> 00:39:03.926]  That's George Soros's group.
[00:39:05.114 --> 00:39:06.896]  This is a military operation.
[00:39:06.896 --> 00:39:10.359]  The liberal, trendy, limp-wristed, simpering NPR voice?
[00:39:10.359 --> 00:39:11.700]  That's a cover, folks.
[00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:12.882]  That's camouflage.
[00:39:12.882 --> 00:39:15.944]  These are hardcore commandos, basically.
[00:39:15.944 --> 00:39:16.705]  Okay?
[00:39:16.705 --> 00:39:18.167]  These people mean business.
[00:39:18.167 --> 00:39:19.828]  Re-education camps, everything.
[00:39:19.828 --> 00:39:23.031]  We played you the internal videos of it last week.
[00:39:23.031 --> 00:39:23.252]  Okay?
[00:39:24.534 --> 00:39:31.356]  You've got to learn, folks, the really vicious people walk around like Bill Gates with lisping voices and act wimpy.
[00:39:31.356 --> 00:39:34.757]  That has gone on for thousands of years, folks.
[00:39:34.757 --> 00:39:38.998]  The guy stomping around acting tough generally is not the person you've got to worry about.
[00:39:38.998 --> 00:39:39.798]  Okay?
[00:39:39.798 --> 00:39:42.038]  A shark, when it wants to attack you, comes up from the dark.
[00:39:42.038 --> 00:39:45.019]  It doesn't want you seeing it.
[00:39:45.019 --> 00:39:52.001]  Yeah, just type in Media Matters Memo Destroy Fox News, I think was the headline.
[00:39:53.612 --> 00:39:55.013]  Yeah, Media Matters, Worgen's Fox.
[00:39:55.013 --> 00:39:55.813]  Now pull that up.
[00:39:55.813 --> 00:39:57.274]  And the media went with the Fox angle.
[00:39:57.274 --> 00:39:58.595]  This is all Cass Sunstein.
[00:39:58.595 --> 00:39:59.496]  It's talk radio.
[00:39:59.496 --> 00:40:04.038]  It's anybody criticizing... There it is, Media Matters, Worgen's Fox.
[00:40:04.038 --> 00:40:06.460]  And it says in there, we're going to infiltrate from within.
[00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:10.182]  We're going to tear them up.
[00:40:10.182 --> 00:40:14.465]  What they do is, Cass Sunstein at the White House says they pose as, quote, conspiracy theorists.
[00:40:14.465 --> 00:40:16.386]  That means people that question known liars.
[00:40:16.386 --> 00:40:19.348]  And then get in-fights going and tell lies about people.
[00:40:24.335 --> 00:40:25.315]  And it just goes on.
[00:40:25.315 --> 00:40:30.377]  The strategy that we had towards Fox was basically a strategy of containment, said Brock.
[00:40:30.377 --> 00:40:37.700]  Media Matters chairman and founder and former conservative journalist, adding that the group's main aim had been to challenge the factual claims.
[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:39.701]  Now scroll down, because I know it's in that article.
[00:40:39.701 --> 00:40:40.301]  Just print it for me.
[00:40:40.301 --> 00:40:41.462]  That's not the part.
[00:40:41.462 --> 00:40:46.043]  It's where they talk about infiltrating?
[00:40:46.043 --> 00:40:46.384]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:40:46.384 --> 00:40:47.304]  Print it for me.
[00:40:47.304 --> 00:40:47.644]  That's good.
[00:40:47.644 --> 00:40:48.184]  That's the article.
[00:40:48.184 --> 00:40:48.624]  They can find it.
[00:40:50.438 --> 00:40:52.259]  And then there's links for the memo itself.
[00:40:52.259 --> 00:40:54.480]  This isn't a game.
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:41:06.725]  These people, Obama shipped tens of thousands of firearms to Mexico to cause carnage and death, to blame the Second Amendment, and those memos are all public, to then call for a ban of all semi-auto.
[00:41:06.725 --> 00:41:16.389]  The Attorney General and the President are both on record in federal court filings and legislation they supported for total abolition of quote civilian ownership of firearms.
[00:41:16.389 --> 00:41:16.929]  They want
[00:41:18.066 --> 00:41:21.108]  Total and complete gun bans.
[00:41:21.108 --> 00:41:22.369]  They're real.
[00:41:22.369 --> 00:41:23.450]  They're real.
[00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:31.796]  This is real revolutionaries by foreign mega banks that want to destroy this country, start a civil war, and start arresting talk show hosts.
[00:41:31.796 --> 00:41:33.177]  You don't think the state police...
[00:41:33.957 --> 00:41:46.026]  Days before we went and covered their gunboats they're buying, they've been federalized basically, we're calling up, harassing our affiliate, calling all their numbers and calling different staff and people and trying to creep them out because they just decided to do it.
[00:41:46.026 --> 00:41:47.727]  They've been given the green light.
[00:41:47.727 --> 00:41:51.990]  That is a bold move.
[00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:56.353]  That is a bold, bold, bold illegal move.
[00:41:58.806 --> 00:42:01.974]  I'm telling you, they're coming after us, okay?
[00:42:01.974 --> 00:42:03.779]  And me, I say that's good.
[00:42:03.779 --> 00:42:05.563]  That means we are hurting these people.
[00:42:05.563 --> 00:42:07.969]  And you don't beat them by backing off and hiding.
[00:42:08.826 --> 00:42:13.709]  You beat them by deciding what side you're on, police, military, talk shows, everybody.
[00:42:13.709 --> 00:42:16.990]  This is it, the fight for America, it's happening.
[00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:34.079]  We might have basically a Bolshevik takeover, funded by the big banks, same ones that funded the takeover of Russia, and they will use the giant hordes of people on welfare who will do anything to get those checks as their political armies and the police and the bureaucrats and everybody paid off, half the public getting a government paycheck or one way or the other.
[00:42:34.079 --> 00:42:34.440]  It's on.
[00:42:35.305 --> 00:42:37.386]  It's on, it's on, this is it.
[00:42:37.386 --> 00:42:40.508]  All you military people, all you police say you want to fight for America.
[00:42:40.508 --> 00:42:41.549]  The red, white, and blue.
[00:42:41.549 --> 00:42:49.334]  That's the Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence that on all these cop shows and movies they demonize and make fun of all day.
[00:42:49.334 --> 00:42:52.116]  You ever notice that?
[00:42:52.116 --> 00:43:00.381]  All these, I mean, cops, when you're watching cop shows and the hero says, you know, forget the Constitution, I hate it, and they all have high fives and then bust the bad guy.
[00:43:00.381 --> 00:43:02.623]  You're being trained to hate America.
[00:43:03.464 --> 00:43:23.670]  You better decide now, and let me tell you, just like Russia, just like Germany, all of you, just like the Communist Chinese, just like Pol Pot, in every case, the group that is seen as opposition but within the power structure, when a real takeover happens, you are the number one people they're going to target.
[00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:25.250]  They are coming after you.
[00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:32.012]  You don't just think they have veterans as the number one enemy in all these secret reports we got that the media admit were real, MIAC, Homeland Security, and others.
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:34.801]  They hate police.
[00:43:34.801 --> 00:43:37.224]  They've got all the good cops and databases.
[00:43:37.224 --> 00:43:44.052]  If you're a good police officer that changes people's tires and it doesn't want to social climb and doesn't do corrupt stuff, you've been put in a file.
[00:43:44.864 --> 00:43:45.885]  They've assessed you.
[00:43:45.885 --> 00:43:47.545]  You think you're out assessing the public?
[00:43:47.545 --> 00:43:50.647]  You, on record, are in a file.
[00:43:50.647 --> 00:43:51.948]  They know you.
[00:43:51.948 --> 00:43:53.829]  They know your surfing habits, everything.
[00:43:53.829 --> 00:43:55.130]  They got a file on you.
[00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:59.452]  The devil, the New World Order, already knows you're the enemy.
[00:43:59.452 --> 00:44:01.113]  You're already under attack.
[00:44:01.113 --> 00:44:04.395]  They're already gonna come after you if they bring this in!
[00:44:04.395 --> 00:44:08.297]  The only chance we've got is to stand up to this and stop playing games!
[00:44:10.365 --> 00:44:13.448]  Used to I'd have to travel a hundred miles to show a military takeover.
[00:44:13.448 --> 00:44:17.991]  Now I can drive right up the road three miles.
[00:44:17.991 --> 00:44:21.514]  They got the TSA on the streets of San Antonio, Houston, Dallas.
[00:44:21.514 --> 00:44:25.157]  Now I was reading they're gonna start coming to Austin.
[00:44:25.157 --> 00:44:26.919]  Everything's getting shut down except the border.
[00:44:29.158 --> 00:44:32.201]  They got the cops all roided up, crazed out of their minds.
[00:44:32.201 --> 00:44:35.144]  Oh, we're going to have a war with the American people.
[00:44:35.144 --> 00:44:36.666]  Ladies and gentlemen, I got more reports.
[00:44:36.666 --> 00:44:38.287]  Gun sales were record last year.
[00:44:38.287 --> 00:44:39.869]  They're now topping that record.
[00:44:39.869 --> 00:44:41.651]  The guns are selling out everywhere.
[00:44:41.651 --> 00:44:43.032]  Ammo's selling out.
[00:44:43.032 --> 00:44:44.414]  Everyone's buying firearms.
[00:44:44.414 --> 00:44:46.636]  Liberals are all waking up buying them.
[00:44:46.636 --> 00:44:50.219]  The globalists have to bring in tyranny, folks, because the revolution's here.
[00:44:50.219 --> 00:44:52.422]  The second American restoration is here.
[00:44:53.652 --> 00:44:54.453]  It's here.
[00:44:54.453 --> 00:45:00.776]  We now know that revolutionaries with big banking financing came in here and did take America over.
[00:45:00.776 --> 00:45:02.918]  And now America's waking up to that.
[00:45:02.918 --> 00:45:07.661]  And let me tell you, we are in a crisis so big, so real.
[00:45:07.661 --> 00:45:13.865]  I've told you over and over again, Iran is a political diversion because during a war they can take liberties easier.
[00:45:13.865 --> 00:45:15.185]  War is the health of the state.
[00:45:15.185 --> 00:45:17.367]  They're going to use that war
[00:45:19.005 --> 00:45:27.071]  The huge multi-region war that Rand Corporation called for three years ago to go after their primary target, the rich West.
[00:45:27.071 --> 00:45:29.112]  We are the enemy.
[00:45:29.112 --> 00:45:41.241]  Our Magna Carta, if you're in the commonwealths from Australia to England to Scotland to Northern Ireland, if you have a history of Magna Carta,
[00:45:42.481 --> 00:45:48.607]  If you have what grew out of that, the flower of it, Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights, Constitution, we're the enemy.
[00:45:48.607 --> 00:45:50.148]  We're the last in line.
[00:45:50.148 --> 00:45:51.410]  We're all that's left.
[00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:52.771]  You understand that?
[00:45:52.771 --> 00:45:57.956]  We are both the great engine of evil worldwide, but we are also the savior.
[00:45:57.956 --> 00:45:59.037]  It's the battles here.
[00:45:59.037 --> 00:46:01.039]  The decision will be made here.
[00:46:01.039 --> 00:46:03.881]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[00:46:03.881 --> 00:46:05.042]  So the great evil is here.
[00:46:05.703 --> 00:46:10.828]  There's many other horrible evils, but the great evil's here because evil is attracted to power.
[00:46:10.828 --> 00:46:12.549]  Evil wants the levers of power.
[00:46:12.549 --> 00:46:19.755]  So the great contest over the wheel that governs the direction of our ship is happening now, and you've got to decide!
[00:46:19.755 --> 00:46:20.596]  You've got to decide.
[00:46:20.596 --> 00:46:22.017]  I'm not scared at all.
[00:46:22.017 --> 00:46:25.660]  I'm ready for whatever comes in this.
[00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:28.283]  I'm ready.
[00:46:28.283 --> 00:46:29.464]  Because I know
[00:46:30.834 --> 00:46:32.395]  That this is my destiny.
[00:46:32.395 --> 00:46:34.175]  This is what I'm here for.
[00:46:34.175 --> 00:46:35.836]  This life is short.
[00:46:35.836 --> 00:46:38.357]  And I want to live it to the fullest for humanity.
[00:46:38.357 --> 00:46:39.938]  I want to be a good person.
[00:46:39.938 --> 00:46:44.680]  I'm going to follow my heart that wants justice.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:46.381]  I'm going to recognize good from evil.
[00:46:46.381 --> 00:46:49.742]  I've made my decision.
[00:46:49.742 --> 00:46:52.203]  And there's no fear.
[00:46:52.203 --> 00:46:58.366]  And the power of the world, the power of the system, the power of the devil, link no mistake, that's what it is, is broken!
[00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:04.392]  It's broken when you give yourself over to good, give yourself over to God.
[00:47:04.392 --> 00:47:09.694]  Whatever you are, atheist, agnostic, whatever you are, you're not gonna find it in some establishment church.
[00:47:09.694 --> 00:47:16.518]  Just ask God to show you in this great time of challenge that's coming, and believe me, you'll be shown.
[00:47:16.518 --> 00:47:22.140]  You're on a planet in the middle of the universe, and you don't think there's things you don't see or know.
[00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:25.002]  You can't feel it because you've been spiritually blinded.
[00:47:25.993 --> 00:47:30.316]  By the fake churches, by the world, by its facsimiles, by all of it.
[00:47:30.316 --> 00:47:34.239]  You have got to ask God to open your eyes.
[00:47:34.239 --> 00:47:40.263]  God will not force himself on you.
[00:47:40.263 --> 00:47:43.485]  You have got to ask.
[00:47:43.485 --> 00:47:46.408]  That is a spiritual law.
[00:47:46.408 --> 00:47:48.009]  Like the parable of Ampire.
[00:47:48.009 --> 00:47:49.530]  It has to ask permission to come in.
[00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:50.190]  You gotta let it in.
[00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:52.572]  It's the same thing for good.
[00:47:52.572 --> 00:47:53.513]  It is a decision.
[00:47:54.423 --> 00:47:58.106]  It is a decision that you have to make.
[00:47:58.106 --> 00:48:00.707]  And just commit and turn loose.
[00:48:00.707 --> 00:48:02.789]  That's the secret.
[00:48:02.789 --> 00:48:04.430]  Just turn loose.
[00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:10.154]  And by the way, giving yourself over to God is not becoming a slave.
[00:48:10.154 --> 00:48:15.918]  That's what happens when you serve the devil, Satan.
[00:48:15.918 --> 00:48:17.139]  It's more than that.
[00:48:17.139 --> 00:48:22.022]  You just surrender to the fact that it's already there.
[00:48:22.022 --> 00:48:23.924]  And then that's where the great peace comes from.
[00:48:25.287 --> 00:48:27.328]  And great discernment.
[00:48:27.328 --> 00:48:28.768]  And I know why people serve evil.
[00:48:28.768 --> 00:48:30.689]  They seek power.
[00:48:30.689 --> 00:48:33.129]  They want to get back at people that have done them wrong.
[00:48:33.129 --> 00:48:37.731]  They feel weak.
[00:48:37.731 --> 00:48:41.892]  And I feel sorry for those that never really experienced true power.
[00:48:41.892 --> 00:48:44.473]  True discernment.
[00:48:44.473 --> 00:48:48.514]  If they only knew that they are only masters of evil.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.442]  And that is such a small part of the spectrum of creation and reality.
[00:48:54.442 --> 00:49:02.025]  It is such a... It is such a shadow of creation.
[00:49:02.025 --> 00:49:07.348]  But because of the evil, we can recognize the good.
[00:49:07.348 --> 00:49:15.831]  Because of that, and I don't mean to get spiritual here, it's just that's what's in my heart, and this is a spiritual choice.
[00:49:15.831 --> 00:49:16.952]  Make no mistake.
[00:49:18.075 --> 00:49:19.435]  It is a spiritual war.
[00:49:19.435 --> 00:49:21.276]  The globalists print the money.
[00:49:21.276 --> 00:49:23.516]  They want your mind.
[00:49:23.516 --> 00:49:27.497]  They want your fertility destroyed.
[00:49:27.497 --> 00:49:31.398]  They want your power destroyed.
[00:49:31.398 --> 00:49:40.521]  They want to drug you and psychologically stunt you because you are beautiful and powerful and shining and they hate it.
[00:49:41.181 --> 00:49:44.985]  They want to deface God's creation.
[00:49:44.985 --> 00:49:57.718]  They want to beguile you and stunt you, because once you experience good versus evil, there is no choice, there is no debate, there is no questioning.
[00:49:57.718 --> 00:50:01.762]  It is a sick joke!
[00:50:01.762 --> 00:50:04.965]  Once you experience the true power in this universe,
[00:50:06.064 --> 00:50:10.608]  It is a joke and you see the blind leading the blind.
[00:50:10.608 --> 00:50:13.610]  You see them have no idea.
[00:50:13.610 --> 00:50:18.014]  They foolishly believe they have power because they understand this temporal world.
[00:50:18.014 --> 00:50:29.643]  They have no idea that that is only one small slice of an ocean that is limitlessly deep.
[00:50:29.643 --> 00:50:30.704]  Life is power.
[00:50:33.052 --> 00:50:40.595]  Creation is power, and it only flows from the Creator!
[00:50:40.595 --> 00:50:41.895]  Alright, I gotta get to the news here.
[00:50:41.895 --> 00:50:42.876]  We've got a guest coming up.
[00:50:42.876 --> 00:50:44.396]  It is incredible information.
[00:50:44.396 --> 00:50:45.477]  We've got really bad news.
[00:50:45.477 --> 00:50:47.177]  Holder to justify killing Americans.
[00:50:47.177 --> 00:50:48.598]  And here's another one.
[00:50:48.598 --> 00:50:49.178]  Reuters.
[00:50:49.178 --> 00:50:49.338]  U.S.
[00:50:49.338 --> 00:50:52.459]  court approves warrantless searches of cell phones.
[00:50:52.459 --> 00:50:54.720]  I mean, it is coming down, folks.
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:58.141]  The criminals are in charge, and we've gotta call them out.
[00:50:58.141 --> 00:50:59.502]  We've gotta go head on up against them.
[00:51:01.099 --> 00:51:04.802]  IRS, the three most dreaded letters of the alphabet.
[00:51:04.802 --> 00:51:15.529]  If you owe back taxes, have unfiled tax returns, are receiving threatening letters, or have IRS agents coming to your home or place of business, you need an experienced IRS agent fighting on your side.
[00:51:15.529 --> 00:51:19.032]  Call the Tax Relief Division of the Law Offices of Craig Zimmerman at 800-652-6978.
[00:51:21.854 --> 00:51:31.678]  Spearheaded by a former IRS agent, we know how to negotiate a reduction in the tax you owe, stop wage garnishments, lift bank levies, and negotiate an affordable repayment plan.
[00:51:31.678 --> 00:51:38.780]  With 17 years as a practicing attorney and an A-plus Better Business rating, we'll get the IRS off your back once and for all.
[00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:43.082]  In fact, recently, when an IRS employee had a tax problem, she called us.
[00:51:43.402 --> 00:51:46.906]  Stop being afraid and call right now for your free consultation at 800-652-6978.
[00:51:46.906 --> 00:51:48.848]  The phone call is free and there's no obligation, so call 800-652-6978.
[00:51:48.848 --> 00:51:49.449]  Again, that's 800-652-6978.
[00:51:49.449 --> 00:51:51.191]  Actual results based on individual client circumstances.
[00:52:01.482 --> 00:52:05.946]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[00:52:05.946 --> 00:52:07.447]  Everyone can feel it.
[00:52:07.447 --> 00:52:16.335]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[00:52:16.335 --> 00:52:19.757]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[00:52:19.757 --> 00:52:20.798]  But take heart.
[00:52:20.798 --> 00:52:24.622]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[00:52:24.622 --> 00:52:29.586]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[00:52:29.986 --> 00:52:33.847]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[00:52:33.847 --> 00:52:35.567]  The globalists are scared.
[00:52:35.567 --> 00:52:36.887]  They've overreached.
[00:52:36.887 --> 00:52:40.408]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[00:52:58.052 --> 00:53:01.474]  The InfoWar now goes into high gear!
[00:53:01.474 --> 00:53:06.696]  We all know that Berkey Water Purification Systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:54:02.268 --> 00:54:07.618]  All the leaves are brown And the sky is grey
[00:54:09.847 --> 00:54:11.167]  Here are the reports.
[00:54:11.167 --> 00:54:14.468]  This is the Washington Post, 2003.
[00:54:14.468 --> 00:54:16.189]  School boosts preparedness for attack.
[00:54:16.189 --> 00:54:19.990]  Many anti-terror plans would stop parents from picking up their children.
[00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:23.391]  FEMA and the Army take you to a FEMA camp.
[00:54:23.391 --> 00:54:24.291]  That's 2003.
[00:54:24.291 --> 00:54:26.852]  Oh, here's my article.
[00:54:26.852 --> 00:54:34.474]  Red alert means you will be a prisoner in your home and the schools will keep you from your children, taking them to secret locations.
[00:54:35.356 --> 00:54:43.277]  And then we have links to, in 1999, when I got video shot by parents, and secret documents.
[00:54:43.277 --> 00:54:44.198]  In 1999.
[00:54:44.198 --> 00:54:45.398]  In fact, here it is.
[00:54:45.398 --> 00:54:47.938]  If you guys give me a document cam shot of this.
[00:54:47.938 --> 00:54:49.598]  This is the actual document right here.
[00:54:49.598 --> 00:54:59.500]  This is the Nashoba Regional School District Crisis Plan Information for Families.
[00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:04.161]  And this is from... This is the documents out of...
[00:55:06.721 --> 00:55:13.364]  This is the documents out of 2003, but I've got the other ones in here where it was going on in 1999.
[00:55:13.364 --> 00:55:21.848]  You can just go and follow all the links there in the article and see all of that, but this is what's going on, okay?
[00:55:21.848 --> 00:55:23.809]  This is what's happening.
[00:55:23.809 --> 00:55:30.112]  And now they have the Army at the Kite Festival in Austin out there guarding everyone!
[00:55:31.716 --> 00:55:33.679]  And directing everyone.
[00:55:33.679 --> 00:55:38.885]  And people, I was watching the video, the body language, people kind of walking up to the military like, everything's TSA now.
[00:55:38.885 --> 00:55:44.072]  And it's just guys in camo, the police in camo, everything merging together.
[00:55:44.072 --> 00:55:45.674]  And remember, I told you for years that was coming.
[00:55:45.674 --> 00:55:48.657]  I think I'm going to ask Colonel Schaefer about that when he comes on.
[00:55:49.895 --> 00:55:50.475]  Look at this.
[00:55:50.475 --> 00:55:53.537]  Holder to justify killing Americans on foreign soil.
[00:55:53.537 --> 00:55:57.020]  Obama administration firms up support for state-sponsored assassination.
[00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:59.882]  But they've got this new power, they say, to kill us domestically.
[00:55:59.882 --> 00:56:01.543]  No judge, no jury, or kidnap us.
[00:56:02.742 --> 00:56:04.023]  Here's the other one.
[00:56:04.023 --> 00:56:05.263]  Now listen to this.
[00:56:05.263 --> 00:56:11.365]  You heard yesterday how out in Hawaii now they make women pump breast milk in front of them just to make sure there's not bombs.
[00:56:11.365 --> 00:56:12.606]  I'm not kidding.
[00:56:12.606 --> 00:56:14.427]  And to prove that the breast pump's a breast pump.
[00:56:14.427 --> 00:56:17.148]  Just all part of arbitrary harassment and humiliation.
[00:56:17.148 --> 00:56:19.129]  And then say, you can't go to a private place.
[00:56:19.129 --> 00:56:22.590]  Do it in front of everybody.
[00:56:22.590 --> 00:56:24.611]  And the TSA said, we're sorry for the misunderstanding.
[00:56:24.611 --> 00:56:26.431]  That means they're going to keep doing it.
[00:56:26.431 --> 00:56:27.732]  We're sorry you didn't like it.
[00:56:30.131 --> 00:56:31.432]  They're of their father.
[00:56:31.432 --> 00:56:32.772]  All they do is lie.
[00:56:32.772 --> 00:56:33.132]  U.S.
[00:56:33.132 --> 00:56:35.934]  court approves wireless searches of cell phones.
[00:56:35.934 --> 00:56:36.214]  U.S.
[00:56:36.214 --> 00:56:39.876]  police can search a cell phone for its number without having a warrant.
[00:56:41.383 --> 00:56:43.305]  According to a federal appeals court ruling.
[00:56:43.305 --> 00:56:51.112]  Yeah, in Indiana, Michigan, all over the country, they pull you over now for speeding or whatever, or inspection sticker, and they just say, give me your phone.
[00:56:51.112 --> 00:56:53.734]  And they plug it into a machine and suck everything off of it.
[00:56:53.734 --> 00:56:55.816]  Photos, videos, phone numbers.
[00:56:55.816 --> 00:56:58.378]  And they say, well, it's like searching a notepad in your car.
[00:56:58.378 --> 00:56:59.720]  It's just the general area.
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:03.963]  I mean, total, there's nothing more private than your computer.
[00:57:03.963 --> 00:57:06.566]  That's what it is.
[00:57:06.566 --> 00:57:07.727]  I mean, that's North Korea.
[00:57:09.711 --> 00:57:10.451]  And they love it.
[00:57:10.451 --> 00:57:12.712]  Oh, but it's about keeping you safe, of course.
[00:57:12.712 --> 00:57:15.093]  Okay.
[00:57:15.093 --> 00:57:16.594]  Again, you say you care about America?
[00:57:16.594 --> 00:57:18.194]  Well, then you should be against all of this.
[00:57:18.194 --> 00:57:24.376]  They're getting the country ready for World War III and martial law and financial collapse during that.
[00:57:24.376 --> 00:57:28.358]  Officers in Indiana found a number of cell phones at the scene of a drug bust.
[00:57:28.358 --> 00:57:32.279]  See, it always is for drugs, but they're saying, we'll do it in your car now.
[00:57:32.279 --> 00:57:34.340]  And searched each phone for its telephone number.
[00:57:35.103 --> 00:57:37.665]  Did they search the ATF shipping cocaine in?
[00:57:37.665 --> 00:57:43.950]  Having the numbers allowed the government to subpoena the owners' call histories, linking them to a drug selling scheme.
[00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:47.873]  And again, makes it sound reasonable, but they're saying now for the highway checkpoints.
[00:57:47.873 --> 00:57:50.376]  Incredible.
[00:57:50.376 --> 00:57:57.862]  One of the suspects who was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison argued on appeal that police had no right to search the phone's contents without a warrant.
[00:57:57.862 --> 00:58:01.705]  And see, they used a case that they think sounds reasonable for everybody's phones now.
[00:58:02.961 --> 00:58:03.341]  The U.S.
[00:58:03.341 --> 00:58:20.198]  Court of Appeals, Second, uh, Seventh Circuit rejected the argument on Wednesday, finding that the invasion of privacy was so slight, oh it's so slight, that the police actions did not violate the Fourth Amendment ban on unreasonable searches of your person, houses, papers, and effects.
[00:58:20.198 --> 00:58:20.638]  Oh, really?
[00:58:20.638 --> 00:58:21.459]  My papers and effects?
[00:58:21.459 --> 00:58:23.861]  You gotta have a warrant for my papers and effects?
[00:58:23.861 --> 00:58:24.722]  Oh, but this is digital!
[00:58:26.485 --> 00:58:29.488]  It's digital now, so it doesn't count.
[00:58:29.488 --> 00:58:31.130]  It's written things.
[00:58:31.130 --> 00:58:32.372]  Okay.
[00:58:32.372 --> 00:58:34.935]  Cops, you think the Bill of Rights is a bad idea for you and your family?
[00:58:34.935 --> 00:58:36.957]  Go ahead and join with evil then.
[00:58:36.957 --> 00:58:43.224]  Hope you enjoy it.
[00:58:43.224 --> 00:58:47.209]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.711 --> 00:58:52.011]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:52.011 --> 00:58:57.613]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:58:57.613 --> 00:59:02.615]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:59:02.615 --> 00:59:07.657]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:59:08.197 --> 00:59:13.421]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:59:13.421 --> 00:59:15.742]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:59:15.742 --> 00:59:20.546]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:59:20.546 --> 00:59:21.666]  And here's the best part.
[00:59:21.666 --> 00:59:24.709]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:59:24.709 --> 00:59:28.011]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:59:28.331 --> 00:59:31.514]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:59:31.514 --> 00:59:33.736]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:59:33.736 --> 00:59:34.697]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:59:34.697 --> 00:59:35.077]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:59:35.077 --> 00:59:38.320]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:40.062]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:55.972]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.972 --> 01:00:05.339]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.339 --> 01:00:06.640]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:08.401]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.401 --> 01:00:10.163]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.163 --> 01:00:11.744]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.744 --> 01:00:13.685]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.685 --> 01:00:17.488]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.488 --> 01:00:21.591]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.426 --> 01:00:26.547]  We are into hour number two.
[01:00:26.547 --> 01:00:30.289]  After this quick break, we're going to have Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer joining us.
[01:00:30.289 --> 01:00:34.711]  Look at this headline.
[01:00:34.711 --> 01:00:44.156]  TSA asks woman to prove her breast pump is real by making her pump both bottles full, they demanded, and to present it to them.
[01:00:44.156 --> 01:00:50.139]  And of course, there's other cases where they make women now drink their milk in front of them to prove it's not weapons or dump it out.
[01:00:51.058 --> 01:00:52.479]  And it's all about the humiliation.
[01:00:52.479 --> 01:00:57.282]  It's all about what crazy orders can we give these people?
[01:00:57.282 --> 01:00:58.964]  Just like in boot camp, they give you crazy orders.
[01:00:58.964 --> 01:01:02.666]  And it's about, hey, follow my orders.
[01:01:02.666 --> 01:01:04.087]  So you pull up.
[01:01:04.087 --> 01:01:05.408]  There's a checkpoint.
[01:01:05.408 --> 01:01:06.409]  They're going to search your car.
[01:01:06.409 --> 01:01:07.069]  The Army's there.
[01:01:07.069 --> 01:01:08.911]  The Marines are there.
[01:01:08.911 --> 01:01:09.671]  I'm in New York.
[01:01:09.671 --> 01:01:12.733]  Start filming troops with live ammo in their guns.
[01:01:12.733 --> 01:01:16.076]  They run over and cuss at me and say, turn your camera off.
[01:01:16.076 --> 01:01:19.018]  And I've always noticed, you know, troops that are intelligent,
[01:01:20.384 --> 01:01:22.085]  They don't act like that.
[01:01:22.085 --> 01:01:23.346]  They're the ones that are sent overseas.
[01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:28.609]  It's always goonies that I run into at these things.
[01:01:28.609 --> 01:01:29.589]  Goonies.
[01:01:29.589 --> 01:01:36.233]  Who just are so mindless and so stupid they can hardly talk.
[01:01:36.233 --> 01:01:38.534]  God, this country is in so much trouble, folks.
[01:01:38.534 --> 01:01:40.035]  I hope you realize this isn't a game.
[01:01:40.035 --> 01:01:41.396]  This is all real.
[01:01:41.396 --> 01:01:43.157]  This is all happening.
[01:01:43.157 --> 01:01:44.758]  I gotta pinch myself sometimes.
[01:01:44.758 --> 01:01:46.939]  It is so wild what the New World Order is doing.
[01:01:48.891 --> 01:01:59.939]  Courts are ruling the police can pull you over, federal court, and they have these machines where they just suck everything out of your phone in a matter of minutes.
[01:01:59.939 --> 01:02:02.921]  And they say, give me your phone.
[01:02:02.921 --> 01:02:05.843]  And then they download the full contents of it.
[01:02:05.843 --> 01:02:12.747]  And they just had a federal court rule, your phones can have everything taken off of them without a warrant.
[01:02:12.747 --> 01:02:14.729]  I mean, that's just blatant.
[01:02:14.729 --> 01:02:16.029]  Blatant.
[01:02:16.029 --> 01:02:17.851]  That'd be like saying they can come to your house and take your PC.
[01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:22.951]  But see, the courts call it a phone and everything on it.
[01:02:22.951 --> 01:02:24.031]  It's a smart computer.
[01:02:24.031 --> 01:02:31.014]  It's going to be on the head of a pen soon.
[01:02:31.014 --> 01:02:32.314]  Everything linked together.
[01:02:32.314 --> 01:02:34.475]  Soon nothing will be held on the computer itself.
[01:02:34.475 --> 01:02:36.535]  It'll all be in clouds.
[01:02:36.535 --> 01:02:37.496]  So you won't have a choice.
[01:02:37.496 --> 01:02:40.037]  And they're saying they're just going to have access to all that without warrants.
[01:02:40.037 --> 01:02:40.857]  They already do.
[01:02:42.346 --> 01:02:44.467]  They just haven't told the local police that yet.
[01:02:44.467 --> 01:02:45.967]  They slowly dole it out.
[01:02:45.967 --> 01:02:49.069]  You're going to work with the Army in a secret operation.
[01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:49.849]  The Army's here.
[01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:52.810]  They're going to dress up in your uniforms and go on raids.
[01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:53.771]  Oh, what are we going to raid?
[01:02:53.771 --> 01:02:56.252]  Oh, we're going to raid gun shops.
[01:02:56.252 --> 01:03:03.674]  Local police with ATF and Army and Marines for 24 years.
[01:03:03.674 --> 01:03:07.136]  We learned in 2001.
[01:03:07.136 --> 01:03:08.837]  Saw the documents, photos, everything.
[01:03:08.837 --> 01:03:09.677]  It's in Road to Tyranny.
[01:03:11.118 --> 01:03:20.886]  That they've had a secret program for at least 24 years, raiding gun owners, raiding farmhouses, harassing patriots, with the military.
[01:03:20.886 --> 01:03:22.947]  We're already under martial law.
[01:03:22.947 --> 01:03:24.709]  I told you Northcom was coming.
[01:03:24.709 --> 01:03:26.090]  Got that now.
[01:03:26.090 --> 01:03:26.490]  All of it.
[01:03:26.490 --> 01:03:30.513]  We are an occupied country, and it has nothing to do with fighting Al-Syaida.
[01:03:30.513 --> 01:03:33.756]  It is all about going after the American people.
[01:03:36.215 --> 01:03:45.720]  And everything, as I've told you for 10 years, that goes on the airports is a public dog training Pavlovian operant conditioning program and will be everywhere.
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:49.902]  Now the TSA is certifying at public school security.
[01:03:49.902 --> 01:03:50.943]  You saw that in New Mexico.
[01:03:50.943 --> 01:03:51.763]  They won't believe it, guys.
[01:03:51.763 --> 01:03:59.027]  Type in TSA at New Mexico prom.
[01:03:59.027 --> 01:04:01.988]  And the hands go in the pants.
[01:04:01.988 --> 01:04:04.590]  The TSA is the master control switch.
[01:04:05.493 --> 01:04:16.317]  Uncertified, no constitution, no basic training, not bonded, not under the constitution, a whole separate group of drooling brown shirts who command and now train your police.
[01:04:16.317 --> 01:04:17.797]  Because the federal money comes in.
[01:04:17.797 --> 01:04:20.658]  Your gunboats, your armored vehicles, your weapons.
[01:04:20.658 --> 01:04:25.180]  They take the money, you seize them, drug bust, goes to the feds and back to the states.
[01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:27.120]  And then they come and say, here are your commanders.
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:28.921]  Drooling idiots.
[01:04:30.947 --> 01:04:32.048]  You're like, that's crazy.
[01:04:32.048 --> 01:04:33.009]  Why?
[01:04:33.009 --> 01:04:34.049]  Stalin did it.
[01:04:34.049 --> 01:04:35.331]  Hitler did it.
[01:04:35.331 --> 01:04:36.451]  Chai Kams did it.
[01:04:36.451 --> 01:04:40.234]  They always hire a drooling force to command.
[01:04:40.234 --> 01:04:40.875]  You understand that?
[01:04:40.875 --> 01:04:44.238]  This is what the New World Order wants.
[01:04:44.238 --> 01:04:50.262]  Its armies are drooling idiots who will stand next to radiation machines all day.
[01:04:50.262 --> 01:04:54.246]  The army of evil is always a bunch of idiots.
[01:04:54.246 --> 01:04:56.888]  You understand that?
[01:04:56.888 --> 01:04:59.410]  And they always command the flower of the military.
[01:05:01.513 --> 01:05:16.986]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:05:16.986 --> 01:05:20.669]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.

[01:06:01.024 --> 01:06:06.010]  Folks, Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.

[01:07:00.817 --> 01:07:01.878]  I had tried everything.
[01:07:01.878 --> 01:07:07.363]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:07:07.363 --> 01:07:12.207]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[01:07:12.207 --> 01:07:18.573]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[01:07:19.053 --> 01:07:30.275]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:07:30.275 --> 01:07:34.736]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[01:07:34.736 --> 01:07:40.998]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:07:40.998 --> 01:07:42.138]  Now that's results!
[01:07:42.578 --> 01:07:55.084]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products, and you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[01:07:57.645 --> 01:08:01.027]  Infowarsteam.com.
[01:08:01.027 --> 01:08:08.391]  This is Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:11.451 --> 01:08:14.812]  All right, Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer's with us for the rest of the hour.
[01:08:14.812 --> 01:08:17.053]  He's going to be on MSNBC and RT today.
[01:08:17.053 --> 01:08:20.734]  So he's done a lot of new research on the Iran situation.
[01:08:20.734 --> 01:08:22.855]  It's continually changing very quickly.
[01:08:22.855 --> 01:08:26.276]  He headed up Operation Stratus Ivy.
[01:08:26.276 --> 01:08:32.098]  And of course, Abel Danger, he could have been able to kill bin Laden on multiple occasions and was blocked from doing so.
[01:08:32.098 --> 01:08:39.600]  His book that came out last year, Operation Dark Heart, was a New York Times bestseller, but they blocked it for a while and excised a bunch of it out.
[01:08:40.683 --> 01:08:44.605]  Basically it's punishment, because a lot of what was in there that they even excised out had already been reported.
[01:08:44.605 --> 01:08:48.147]  It was just from eyewitness accounts, so that was a way to punish him.
[01:08:48.147 --> 01:08:55.672]  I've got him on about Iran, about Syria, about where all this is going, but I wanted to first, because he was on hold listening during the last short segment,
[01:08:56.587 --> 01:08:56.947]  I don't know.
[01:09:17.065 --> 01:09:19.910]  Many anti-terror plans would stop parents from picking up children.
[01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:26.500]  I sent my reporters to Denver last year during a giant urban warfare terrorism drill, a tabletop exercise.
[01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:29.885]  And sure enough, they were practicing taking kids to the sports stadiums.
[01:09:31.489 --> 01:09:33.030]  Super creepy.
[01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:41.498]  Total acclamation for military operations and now they've gotten rid of posse commentatus basically with this NDAA.
[01:09:41.498 --> 01:09:46.063]  Bruce Fine, constitutional scholar, congressional advisor, has said it is treason.
[01:09:46.063 --> 01:09:50.567]  Countless, Bob Barr, former congressman, former CIA, he says it's totally illegal.
[01:09:50.567 --> 01:09:52.048]  But we don't even need them to tell us that.
[01:09:52.048 --> 01:09:54.551]  This is blatant what you see in third world countries.
[01:09:55.632 --> 01:09:59.373]  And thank God our military has a long history of following the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:09:59.373 --> 01:10:04.414]  We're not Venezuela or Nigeria, but they're trying their hardest.
[01:10:04.414 --> 01:10:07.715]  Instead, they're doing what Hitler did, the out-of-control bureaucracies are.
[01:10:07.715 --> 01:10:09.736]  They're creating a brown shirt.
[01:10:09.736 --> 01:10:14.157]  Stalin opened the prisons up and hired low-wage kind of just thugs.
[01:10:15.097 --> 01:10:24.740]  To be his frontline goons because the history of the Russian military, who wasn't perfect, they still wouldn't do the type of purges that Lenin and then Stalin wanted.
[01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:26.401]  So that's what they're doing.
[01:10:26.401 --> 01:10:28.101]  Now that's my view on this.
[01:10:28.101 --> 01:10:33.023]  The TSA is now in Dallas sticking their hands in people's pants at the train stations and bus stations.
[01:10:33.023 --> 01:10:34.243]  They're now in San Antonio.
[01:10:34.243 --> 01:10:39.645]  They now have military police in San Antonio at the Riverwalk, where I used to go a few times a year.
[01:10:39.645 --> 01:10:41.606]  I was there and I can't stand it.
[01:10:41.606 --> 01:10:44.127]  Looking at you, talking to you with side arms on.
[01:10:45.385 --> 01:10:56.604]  I want to talk to Colonel Schaefer about this right now before we get into the huge issues with Iran and the rest of it, but clearly they're gearing up for a big war and then counter-strikes by Iran and instead of
[01:10:58.055 --> 01:11:07.684]  Instead of them actually going after any assets, you guaranteed it's going to be used against the American people as the Homeland Security documents that I received from law enforcement three years ago that made national news show.
[01:11:07.684 --> 01:11:11.627]  They say the number one threat is returning veterans, gun owners, libertarians, conservatives.
[01:11:11.627 --> 01:11:13.869]  So that's my briefing to everybody.
[01:11:13.869 --> 01:11:20.835]  And I know that's a large statement, Colonel Schaefer, but I wanted to state that wider spectrum of data points to where you'd have to be
[01:11:21.717 --> 01:11:26.669]  Blind out there if there's new listeners to not know this is crossing the Rubicon.
[01:11:26.669 --> 01:11:27.691]  This is third world.
[01:11:27.691 --> 01:11:30.077]  This is North Korea This is scary.
[01:11:30.077 --> 01:11:31.140]  What do you say to all that?
[01:11:32.695 --> 01:11:34.236]  100% regarding the Posse Comitatus issue.
[01:11:34.236 --> 01:11:41.340]  I'm one of the folks, I actually was in hearings in front of the House, the Senate Judiciary Committee back in 2005 on this very issue.
[01:11:41.340 --> 01:11:46.683]  And frankly, one of the things that held us back from doing everything we could have was Posse Comitatus.
[01:11:46.683 --> 01:11:51.905]  And I argue there's justification for working within the framework of Posse Comitatus.
[01:11:51.905 --> 01:11:56.728]  But in the case of the new NDAA, which was signed by the President by December,
[01:11:57.588 --> 01:11:58.769]  There's no justification.
[01:11:58.769 --> 01:12:08.055]  And essentially, just so your audience understands what happened, the president has declared that anywhere in the world is now a battlefield.
[01:12:08.055 --> 01:12:13.039]  That is to say that where you're sitting this minute, where I'm sitting this minute, is technically a battle space.
[01:12:13.619 --> 01:12:22.701]  And therefore, he has ultimate, absolute authority to do whatever the hell he wants, whatever he wants, to deem anyone a threat.
[01:12:22.701 --> 01:12:29.763]  And by the way, there's no oversight for how you go through a process of establishing someone's potential as a threat.
[01:12:29.763 --> 01:12:38.505]  And so, Bruce Fine is a very close friend of mine, a constitutional scholar, who has said very clearly that there is no legal basis
[01:12:39.245 --> 01:12:43.848]  For the NDAA to expand those level of authorities to the President.
[01:12:43.848 --> 01:12:47.390]  Now, there's been two clear abuses of this so far.
[01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:49.712]  And frankly, it preceded the NDAA.
[01:12:49.712 --> 01:12:53.234]  One is the assassination of Anwar al-Awlaki and his son.
[01:12:53.234 --> 01:12:53.774]  They are U.S.
[01:12:53.774 --> 01:12:54.234]  citizens.
[01:12:54.234 --> 01:12:55.435]  I don't care how you feel about them.
[01:12:55.435 --> 01:12:56.936]  I really don't.
[01:12:56.936 --> 01:13:00.939]  But the premise was, well, you know, they're bad people so we should kill them.
[01:13:00.939 --> 01:13:01.999]  Wrong answer.
[01:13:01.999 --> 01:13:04.461]  They were bad people and they clearly violated the U.S.
[01:13:04.461 --> 01:13:05.581]  laws and bring them to justice.
[01:13:05.581 --> 01:13:08.063]  Justice means getting them to a process, especially
[01:13:08.143 --> 01:13:15.325]  Well, you'd think you'd want to get a hold of him to get the so-called intelligence, but expanding on that, that sets the precedent to kill anybody.
[01:13:15.325 --> 01:13:16.926]  And that's part of being an intelligence officer.
[01:13:16.926 --> 01:13:24.368]  I'm glad you brought it up, because I always say, you know, I am for the idea of live captures, because dead men literally don't tell any tales.
[01:13:24.368 --> 01:13:28.890]  So you've got to consider the intelligence value and why they're doing that, I believe, in the case of Anwar al-Awlaki.
[01:13:31.658 --> 01:13:32.098]  Before 9-11.
[01:13:32.098 --> 01:13:41.523]  Alex, frankly, you know, that's one of the things that no one wanted to come out, that this guy had been a double, triple agent, and they were actually working with him, with the FBI.
[01:13:47.901 --> 01:13:52.122]  Anwar al-Awlaki was actually an asset of the FBI before 9-11.
[01:13:52.122 --> 01:13:59.124]  So, frankly, Alex, one of the things this administration was doing on behalf of all administrations was covering their tracks.
[01:13:59.124 --> 01:14:03.365]  Anwar al-Awlaki had a documented relationship with the U.S.
[01:14:03.365 --> 01:14:06.546]  government and the Federal Bureau of Investigation preceding.
[01:14:06.546 --> 01:14:09.026]  This is before 9-11.
[01:14:09.026 --> 01:14:11.907]  So what they were doing, Alex, was going back covering their tracks.
[01:14:12.387 --> 01:14:22.056]  But beyond that now, beyond that, they have established, my second point, a star chamber, if you will, where you now have at least four to five U.S.
[01:14:22.056 --> 01:14:27.762]  citizens, that is to say, people of our status, your status, my status, any status of a U.S.
[01:14:27.762 --> 01:14:30.244]  citizen, on the kill-capture list.
[01:14:30.244 --> 01:14:37.231]  And no one knows how they got there, why they got there, what do you do to get yourself off the list, and oh, by the way, what justifies
[01:14:37.791 --> 01:14:47.396]  The unilateral use of deadly force when no one can actually define what they did that was so threatening to the foundation of the Constitution that allows them to be assassinated on sight.
[01:14:47.396 --> 01:14:49.057]  So this is where we're going with this.
[01:14:49.057 --> 01:14:53.379]  And I hope your audience understands this is not theoretical.
[01:14:53.379 --> 01:15:02.163]  This is not basically someone trying to drum up an area that is fictional.
[01:15:02.163 --> 01:15:02.824]  This is truth.
[01:15:02.824 --> 01:15:03.884]  This is in the NDA.
[01:15:03.884 --> 01:15:05.425]  The language can be read by anybody.
[01:15:06.045 --> 01:15:12.034]  And the presidential signing statement, which he implemented, basically he says, well, yeah, I've got the authority, but I'm not going to abuse it.
[01:15:12.034 --> 01:15:19.225]  And if you believe that, then you'll believe all the other things the president has said over the past three years, which have never come through.
[01:15:19.225 --> 01:15:21.609]  So I have a real problem with it, and your listeners should, too.
[01:15:22.830 --> 01:15:26.271]  Well, just going back to the issue that you raised before, but I want to flesh this out.
[01:15:26.271 --> 01:15:28.171]  I mean, this is illegal.
[01:15:28.171 --> 01:15:31.412]  Congress is supposed to authorize these military operations.
[01:15:31.412 --> 01:15:37.193]  And with the Libya situation, and now with Syria and everything else, Congress is like, sure, we'll give you the authority.
[01:15:37.193 --> 01:15:42.235]  And Obama says, I don't need that, and puts out a policy statement that he gets his authority from the UN.
[01:15:42.235 --> 01:15:45.415]  I mean, it's bad enough for the president to say, I can do this on my own.
[01:15:45.415 --> 01:15:47.076]  That's obviously unconstitutional.
[01:15:47.076 --> 01:15:47.656]  But to say,
[01:15:48.596 --> 01:15:53.962]  I get my authorization from a foreign power made up of foreign governments.
[01:15:53.962 --> 01:15:57.006]  That right there is treason.
[01:15:57.006 --> 01:15:58.327]  And that's what Mr. Fine has said.
[01:15:58.327 --> 01:16:00.249]  That's what many other scholars have pointed out.
[01:16:00.249 --> 01:16:04.434]  I know you're still part of the military and government think tanks and things.
[01:16:04.434 --> 01:16:06.216]  So it's hard for you to talk about that.
[01:16:06.216 --> 01:16:07.317]  But what else is it?
[01:16:08.533 --> 01:16:08.974]  I agree.
[01:16:08.974 --> 01:16:11.376]  Alex, your statement is absolutely correct.
[01:16:11.376 --> 01:16:16.521]  I mean, the President's obligation is to support and defend the Constitution.
[01:16:16.521 --> 01:16:20.085]  There's not a word in there about the United Nations or any of the foreign countries within our Constitution.
[01:16:20.085 --> 01:16:26.532]  So clearly, and again, this is why you and I have discussed this before, the whole Libya operation was illegal.
[01:16:27.993 --> 01:16:34.017]  No funds were ever approved for the President to use in an operation, nor was there any U.S.
[01:16:34.017 --> 01:16:35.978]  military authority to drop one bomb.
[01:16:35.978 --> 01:16:49.147]  By the destination of the President's belief in Libya, we could technically use a tactical nuclear weapon on someone and never have to go to Congress for permission by extending the logic the President used to justify the quote-unquote air campaign only.
[01:16:49.147 --> 01:16:54.070]  So again, I agree with Bruce, Bruce has been on, and this is illegal, and this is not even
[01:16:54.070 --> 01:16:54.971]  This is illegal in a small way.
[01:16:54.971 --> 01:16:56.912]  This is illegal in a very big way.
[01:16:56.912 --> 01:17:13.822]  And until the Congress grows a set of cojones to do something about it, you're going to continue to see this unfettered expansion of President's authority, which I would argue, no matter who it is in the office, Democrat, Republican, doesn't matter, it's illegal.
[01:17:13.822 --> 01:17:14.602]  Wow.
[01:17:14.602 --> 01:17:19.986]  Speaking of the end of Posse Comitatus, all the things that are happening.
[01:17:21.266 --> 01:17:31.294]  It seems like with Obama, and Congress is going along with it to a great extent, they're just going for broke to try to set precedence to be able to get away with anything.
[01:17:31.294 --> 01:17:33.316]  Why are they so confident?
[01:17:33.316 --> 01:17:39.401]  Why are they so brazen when Congress has like a 9 to 10 to 11 percent approval rating depending on which poll?
[01:17:40.336 --> 01:17:40.857]  I don't know.
[01:17:40.857 --> 01:17:54.190]  This is one of those things that I think, um, I scratch my own, you know, I'm on the Hill quite a bit dealing with staff and members, and I scratch myself all the time looking at the fact that Congress has been literally asleep at the switch of doing its job, which is oversight.
[01:17:54.190 --> 01:17:55.892]  They clearly have the responsibility of the purse.
[01:17:56.712 --> 01:18:01.897]  Anything that they decide is not in the best interest of the Constitution's people, they can defund.
[01:18:01.897 --> 01:18:09.082]  And so this is one of those things that I don't understand why they don't take a very strong position on things which are obviously illegal.
[01:18:09.082 --> 01:18:15.287]  And even if they can't do anything about it legally at the moment, they can defund it so, you know, it makes it more difficult, at least.
[01:18:15.287 --> 01:18:19.871]  And the second thing, and you probably know this, Alex, some of the folks I work with have actually sued the President over Libya.
[01:18:20.391 --> 01:18:33.076]  So, you know, one of the things I think the President's counting on is that even if they catch him doing something illegal, he knows he's counting on the court system being very glacial and trying to track him down and force him to follow the Constitution.
[01:18:33.076 --> 01:18:44.681]  So I think right now it's just a brave attempt to continue to expand the, you know, well beyond the George Bush issues, I think it's a continued attempt to expand the authorities and ability of the executive branch to do things without any oversight.
[01:18:44.929 --> 01:19:02.964]  Well, those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it, and I know you teach at war colleges and also teach officers, but you know, but maybe some of the audience who's new doesn't, when presidents or the head of the Roman Senate, any time in history, start declaring they have all the power, every time this happens, look out.
[01:19:03.504 --> 01:19:05.686]  And I haven't seen anything like this since Lincoln.
[01:19:05.686 --> 01:19:09.730]  And that was a domestic issue then.
[01:19:09.730 --> 01:19:12.233]  Lincoln wasn't siding with foreign powers.
[01:19:12.233 --> 01:19:13.914]  He just said, I have this power.
[01:19:13.914 --> 01:19:16.877]  And the courts have judged and Congress has judged it was illegal.
[01:19:16.877 --> 01:19:21.842]  Regardless of which side of that fight people were on, it was illegal according to the Constitution.
[01:19:21.842 --> 01:19:24.605]  But Lincoln wasn't doing it for some foreign UN.
[01:19:24.605 --> 01:19:27.788]  I mean, it's so amazing to see the president.
[01:19:28.228 --> 01:19:34.830]  And we're going to come back and get into Iran, but I want you, when we come back, just briefly, to give me your take on what I just said.
[01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:39.792]  I mean, the president says, I can do this because the UN said so.
[01:19:39.792 --> 01:19:42.333]  It is just mind-boggling.
[01:19:42.333 --> 01:19:45.894]  His latest book is Operation Dark Heart, available in bookstores everywhere.
[01:19:45.894 --> 01:19:47.274]  An amazing read.
[01:19:47.274 --> 01:19:53.396]  He's Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaeffer, and he ran the unit that could have killed bin Laden and was blocked from doing so.
[01:19:53.396 --> 01:19:55.077]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:55.077 --> 01:19:56.037]  Stay with us, straight ahead.
[01:20:01.403 --> 01:20:04.005]  We all know the importance of having storable foods.
[01:20:04.005 --> 01:20:06.066]  But what about when the food runs out?

[01:24:08.556 --> 01:24:11.481]  Okay, the world is going into a deep crisis.
[01:24:11.481 --> 01:24:14.907]  The Bill of Rights and Constitution is being attacked.
[01:24:14.907 --> 01:24:15.948]  I want to get into Iran.
[01:24:15.948 --> 01:24:17.611]  I want to get into Syria.
[01:24:17.611 --> 01:24:18.072]  All of it.
[01:24:18.072 --> 01:24:19.815]  The situation with Russia, Pakistan.
[01:24:19.815 --> 01:24:21.137]  It's all just crazy with Colonel.
[01:24:22.113 --> 01:24:27.155]  Tony Schafer, best-selling book, Operation Dark Heart, a really interesting fellow.
[01:24:27.155 --> 01:24:32.257]  I sent him out to just get him on about some of the wild things he can talk about and all the different operations he's been in.
[01:24:32.257 --> 01:24:34.518]  But right now, we were finishing up.
[01:24:34.518 --> 01:24:38.280]  He just joined us talking about Obama says he can launch these wars because the U.N.
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:40.721]  says so, but they're not wars even though they kill 35,000, 40,000 people.
[01:24:43.522 --> 01:24:45.884]  And it's just it's reaching new Orwellian proportions.
[01:24:45.884 --> 01:24:49.546]  We know they're funding opposition with a lot of Al-Qaeda connections in Syria.
[01:24:49.546 --> 01:24:52.328]  They're using Al-Qaeda groups against Iran.
[01:24:52.328 --> 01:24:57.752]  All of this is just getting wilder and wilder.
[01:24:57.752 --> 01:24:58.753]  Your points on that, Colonel.
[01:25:00.623 --> 01:25:02.505]  Really, the Middle East is a bad place.
[01:25:02.505 --> 01:25:04.286]  A lot of bad people live there.
[01:25:04.286 --> 01:25:14.376]  And I think, I may be very direct about this, I think we've had a White House who has been naive to think that being nice to everybody is going to be the ultimate solution of bringing things forward.
[01:25:14.376 --> 01:25:19.801]  With that said, at the same time, I don't believe having the hammer, I mean, someone who has a hammer, everything tends to look like a nail.
[01:25:19.801 --> 01:25:23.945]  So, you know, what we've got to do is actually understand what is in our U.S.
[01:25:23.945 --> 01:25:24.566]  best interest.
[01:25:25.186 --> 01:25:37.354]  As you pointed out, I think a large part of our government's been focused really here at home on non-existing threats, which really, you know, should make everybody really worried by the fact that they're trying to establish so much authority to do domestic operations.
[01:25:37.354 --> 01:25:46.519]  And as we know, there's been very few instances of domestic terrorism, but most of those have been prominently happened, which were actually of terrorist trade overseas.
[01:25:46.519 --> 01:25:51.823]  Faisal Shahzad, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the underwear bomber, you know, major
[01:25:55.865 --> 01:26:00.168]  Major Hassan, all being handled by the double agent Illaki.
[01:26:00.168 --> 01:26:01.128]  Yeah, so exactly.
[01:26:01.128 --> 01:26:05.531]  So the threats are clearly overseas and it's one of the things the administration continues to pretend otherwise.
[01:26:05.531 --> 01:26:10.454]  This also goes to the heart of the Iranian policy right now.
[01:26:10.454 --> 01:26:17.819]  You know, right now, the President's speech Sunday to AIPAC really, to me, was a political speech.
[01:26:17.819 --> 01:26:20.641]  If he really, if he, President Obama, really believed everything he said,
[01:26:21.381 --> 01:26:25.383]  Everything he said should have been something at the forefront of his policies three years ago.
[01:26:25.383 --> 01:26:26.264]  They weren't.
[01:26:26.264 --> 01:26:30.986]  So now we're left with a situation where I think there's a number of folks who want to go to war.
[01:26:30.986 --> 01:26:36.229]  There's no doubt there's a divide within both the conservative and liberal movements about what to do about Iran.
[01:26:36.229 --> 01:26:38.130]  The problem is this, Alex.
[01:26:38.130 --> 01:26:44.473]  There's a larger picture we're not paying attention to, which is the fact that we're about to see the beginning of a Sunni-Shia Cold War.
[01:26:45.734 --> 01:26:58.704]  And so we're not even worried about the fact that there's larger powers, the Pakistanis who have nuclear weapons, the Saudis who have always wanted to have access to nuclear weapons, and now you've got the Persians in the form of the Iranians actually developing theirs.
[01:26:58.704 --> 01:27:06.230]  And all of this is going to play out in a very bad way unless we figure out who we need to deal with, you know, in both long-term and short-term.
[01:27:06.230 --> 01:27:08.352]  And we're linking this directly to Syria.
[01:27:09.079 --> 01:27:13.360]  We don't know enough about the situation to actually side with someone, and yet we're involving ourselves.
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:19.961]  Much like we did in Libya, we chose to involve ourselves without fully understanding what that involvement would be.
[01:27:19.961 --> 01:27:28.062]  And I would argue that the tribal situation in Libya that exists today, with the foothold of al-Qaeda doing things on the ground there, was not what we intended.
[01:27:28.062 --> 01:27:29.903]  In fact, it was predicted, though.
[01:27:29.903 --> 01:27:33.003]  And again, we're dealing with an administration... No, you predicted it all here on air.
[01:27:33.003 --> 01:27:38.164]  Do we know what happened with the 10,000 missiles and 8,000 of them being hijacked?
[01:27:38.664 --> 01:27:40.665]  Well, we know some of them ended up in Algeria.
[01:27:40.665 --> 01:27:45.008]  They were intercepted going across the border, so we can only imagine what happened to the ones we didn't see.
[01:27:45.008 --> 01:27:46.288]  It's going to be like the drug problem, you know.
[01:27:46.288 --> 01:27:48.650]  It's not the ones you capture that you have to worry about.
[01:27:48.650 --> 01:27:51.071]  It's the ones that you know are out there that you have no idea where they're at.
[01:27:51.071 --> 01:27:55.434]  So I think we're going to see long-term ramifications far, you know, far after this year.
[01:27:55.434 --> 01:28:02.938]  And then when jet airliners get blown up, taken off from the airport, I'm going to lose my liberties because they put al-Qaeda in Libya and gave them all these missiles.
[01:28:02.938 --> 01:28:06.040]  I mean, what you see is an excuse to power grab.
[01:28:07.790 --> 01:28:09.091]  We're seeing across the board.
[01:28:09.091 --> 01:28:15.654]  So, but with that said, though, we've got to look at the fact that the Iranians have been dealing with the North Koreans.
[01:28:15.654 --> 01:28:22.178]  And one of the things I think we talked about a little bit before is, look, the Iranians are just playing the same playbook as they did with the North Koreans.
[01:28:22.178 --> 01:28:27.881]  You know, the North Koreans did exactly what the Iranians are doing now, but the North Koreans did it back in the 90s.
[01:28:27.881 --> 01:28:33.944]  I actually worked operations in Washington in slow motion as the Clinton administration
[01:28:34.364 --> 01:28:40.912]  Basically gave in, gave food to the North Koreans, did all these concessions, never received a thing back.
[01:28:40.912 --> 01:28:51.546]  We're in the same situation now with the Iranians where basically there's a game of brinkmanship going on and we continue to kind of give things away with no expectation of actually achieving victory, which I would argue goes to your point, Alex.
[01:28:52.146 --> 01:28:59.937]  The administration really doesn't necessarily want to achieve any progress by the fact they will consider it to amass, you know, power to do whatever the heck they want.
[01:28:59.937 --> 01:29:02.581]  And I don't, again, I don't think they're defining clearly what the threats are.
[01:29:02.581 --> 01:29:05.125]  We need to be looking at and taking action against.
[01:29:05.984 --> 01:29:09.266]  Well, when I see something in the Western media, I don't just believe it.
[01:29:09.266 --> 01:29:19.630]  But I went and looked it up, as you know, a couple of months ago, I'm sure you saw it, where the head of their parliamentary section on intelligence said, we're going to attack Tel Aviv and New York if you attack us.
[01:29:19.630 --> 01:29:21.931]  That's a pretty reckless statement by Iran.
[01:29:21.931 --> 01:29:29.015]  I want to ask you about that when we get back, because they've been, I mean, as you know, pretty much just in proxy wars in the region.
[01:29:29.015 --> 01:29:30.035]  Why would they say that?
[01:29:30.035 --> 01:29:31.876]  Or was that guy speaking out of turn?
[01:29:31.876 --> 01:29:33.657]  What does it mean that Ahmadinejad is now
[01:29:34.677 --> 01:29:37.558]  Losing political power in the Parliament and maybe out soon.
[01:29:37.558 --> 01:29:45.442]  I want to discuss where you see this going, what the inside baseball is there at the Pentagon.
[01:29:45.442 --> 01:29:50.164]  With Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer, after this quick break, please stay with us.
[01:29:50.164 --> 01:29:54.086]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.086 --> 01:29:56.767]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:07.997 --> 01:30:13.139]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:30:13.139 --> 01:30:28.046]  There's a place down in Tennessee Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[01:30:40.023 --> 01:30:42.164]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:30:42.164 --> 01:30:43.946]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[01:30:58.536 --> 01:30:59.397]  Others don't.
[01:31:01.636 --> 01:31:03.358]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:03.358 --> 01:31:08.665]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:31:08.665 --> 01:31:10.208]  Saving means to make money.

[01:31:27.264 --> 01:31:35.268]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.

[01:32:00.245 --> 01:32:07.468]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, I was still starving.
[01:32:07.468 --> 01:32:25.357]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:32:25.357 --> 01:32:29.479]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[01:32:29.739 --> 01:32:31.520]  And discovered Young Jevity.
[01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:39.686]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:03.866]  We're good to go.
[01:33:12.583 --> 01:33:14.124]  No more Mr. Nice Guy.
[01:33:14.124 --> 01:33:23.228]  Okay, looking at this, we know there's been a covert war against Iran with proxy groups for at least five years because Bush put a policy statement out on it.
[01:33:23.228 --> 01:33:25.709]  It's intensified in the last year.
[01:33:25.709 --> 01:33:26.869]  They've been arresting U.S.
[01:33:26.869 --> 01:33:31.632]  citizens and others and putting them on trial to be executed who they think are spies.
[01:33:33.713 --> 01:33:38.395]  Iran's got its proxy groups, Hezbollah, attacking Israel.
[01:33:38.395 --> 01:33:46.078]  Most of the Israeli advisors, for those that weren't aware of this, the former head of Mossad and others are saying, do not attack Iran.
[01:33:46.078 --> 01:33:50.500]  That'll dig them in with the population that they're unpopular with now.
[01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:52.221]  Iran's going to attack Israel on all sides.
[01:33:53.405 --> 01:33:58.989]  What is the inside baseball, Colonel, on a hot war with Iran?
[01:33:58.989 --> 01:34:01.751]  It looks like a lot of forces are building up in the region.
[01:34:01.751 --> 01:34:05.174]  What are you hearing right now on this front?
[01:34:05.174 --> 01:34:06.875]  And how does Syria tie in?
[01:34:06.875 --> 01:34:09.637]  How does Russia get in more hard line?
[01:34:09.637 --> 01:34:10.538]  How does Pakistan?
[01:34:10.538 --> 01:34:11.539]  How does China?
[01:34:11.539 --> 01:34:14.481]  Because it looks like the battle lines are being drawn.
[01:34:15.691 --> 01:34:20.615]  The Chinese and Russians have been strong advocates of both Syria and Iran for a while.
[01:34:20.615 --> 01:34:28.641]  And let's be brutally honest here, a lot of the technology we're worried about has come from the Chinese and Russians, and some from the North Koreans.
[01:34:28.641 --> 01:34:31.863]  So the fact that there's cooperation, we know.
[01:34:31.863 --> 01:34:34.225]  The question becomes, what will come of that cooperation?
[01:34:35.166 --> 01:34:40.290]  And let's go to the whole idea of the Iranian government and the upcoming elections.
[01:34:40.290 --> 01:34:42.291]  Let me be very clear on this.
[01:34:42.291 --> 01:34:46.715]  The Iranians, as you know, I don't know if people understand, they're not monolithic.
[01:34:46.715 --> 01:34:51.479]  They don't have a single group who actually knows what they want to do.
[01:34:51.479 --> 01:34:54.001]  You have people who are as rational as you and I.
[01:34:54.481 --> 01:34:55.062]  We're good to go.
[01:35:09.258 --> 01:35:12.740]  But as you know, Ahmadinejad is coming up for re-election.
[01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:16.943]  Those elements within the government, those conservative mullahs don't like him.
[01:35:16.943 --> 01:35:19.204]  And so I think you're going to see a lot of things coming out.
[01:35:19.204 --> 01:35:26.328]  So what we need to do, Alex, frankly, to kind of cut to the chase is do everything we can to create chaos within their own ranks.
[01:35:26.328 --> 01:35:37.655]  Anything we can do to actually encourage democracy, encourage those groups who are for reform, who want democracy, we should do everything we can to encourage them and create their own level of chaos within the government.
[01:35:38.076 --> 01:35:46.178]  And let's remember, they're Persians, they're not Arabs, and they have a very proud culture, who are very proud of what they accomplished over, you know, the past two thousand years.
[01:35:47.077 --> 01:35:49.379]  So we've got to look at that and use it to our advantage.
[01:35:49.379 --> 01:35:53.101]  With that said, they have developed a new class of nuclear weapons.
[01:35:53.101 --> 01:36:08.531]  There's articles out today indicating that the North Koreans have probably been paid to actually conduct deep underground nuclear research and attempt to basically use nuclear weapons, actual warheads, to explode them underground.
[01:36:08.531 --> 01:36:14.735]  So I think the Iranians are further ahead than what General Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, cares to admit.
[01:36:14.795 --> 01:36:25.603]  Alright, let me ask you this question, because I've got family and other sources years ago, like two years ago, saying Iran has primitive nuclear weapons but not delivery systems.
[01:36:25.603 --> 01:36:28.446]  But then is that internal Pentagon propaganda?
[01:36:28.446 --> 01:36:30.067]  I mean, I know you have a high security clearance.
[01:36:30.805 --> 01:36:31.085]  I agree.
[01:36:31.085 --> 01:36:31.866]  No, no, no.
[01:36:31.866 --> 01:36:32.266]  I do.
[01:36:32.266 --> 01:36:35.990]  I'm one of the proponents that says that they have at least two weapons.
[01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:37.411]  They have no way to deliver them.
[01:36:37.411 --> 01:36:42.435]  And the basis for this, and again, I would encourage your audience to go do their own due diligence.
[01:36:42.435 --> 01:36:44.397]  Look at what the French and Germans are reporting.
[01:36:44.397 --> 01:36:51.924]  There's been reports out recently by some foreign countries other than ours who are saying, look, there's clear evidence that the North Koreans have been cooperating.
[01:36:52.684 --> 01:36:55.967]  Uh, with the Iranians on development of nuclear systems.
[01:36:55.967 --> 01:36:58.989]  The question becomes, obviously, is putting it on the warhead.
[01:36:58.989 --> 01:37:05.014]  The last overt North Korean blast which occurred a couple years ago was of very small magnitude.
[01:37:05.014 --> 01:37:06.575]  Everybody's saying, ah, it was a fizzle.
[01:37:06.575 --> 01:37:07.196]  No!
[01:37:07.196 --> 01:37:09.498]  What they were going for is miniaturization, Alex.
[01:37:09.498 --> 01:37:15.702]  What they're trying to do, both sides, the North Koreans and Iranians, are trying to miniaturize and put these things on delivery systems.
[01:37:15.702 --> 01:37:18.965]  So I agree with you that I think they're working right now to put these
[01:37:19.005 --> 01:37:19.205]  I think?
[01:37:34.002 --> 01:37:35.603]  Well let me go to this place then.
[01:37:35.603 --> 01:37:36.803]  What about Pakistan?
[01:37:36.803 --> 01:37:45.486]  Because I see that as a greater threat to everybody, that they're very unstable and have over a hundred nukes and medium range delivery systems as you know.
[01:37:45.486 --> 01:37:46.627]  That's on record.
[01:37:46.627 --> 01:37:51.389]  They're very technologically advanced and everything I see the Pentagon doing
[01:37:52.149 --> 01:37:59.995]  Is further destabilizing, and I can see you saying, well, destabilize Iran so they can get more moderates in power.
[01:37:59.995 --> 01:38:01.236]  But then what about Pakistan?
[01:38:01.236 --> 01:38:04.458]  I mean, aren't these policies actually pushing Pakistan into the arms of China?
[01:38:05.302 --> 01:38:11.126]  I think that we have misunder- to quote President Bush, we've misunderestimated the Pakistanis.
[01:38:11.126 --> 01:38:14.309]  The Pakistanis for this entire war, Alex, have been on one side.
[01:38:14.309 --> 01:38:15.690]  The Pakistani side.
[01:38:15.690 --> 01:38:16.830]  And yet we pretended otherwise.
[01:38:16.830 --> 01:38:25.137]  So by the things we've done, I think I've had the unintentional- I don't believe we've intentionally sought out to destabilize the Pakistanis for the very reasons you mentioned.
[01:38:25.137 --> 01:38:26.337]  We know they have nuclear weapons.
[01:38:26.337 --> 01:38:28.199]  We know they have nuclear delivery systems.
[01:38:28.779 --> 01:38:29.059]  I think?
[01:38:58.719 --> 01:39:02.561]  So, we've allowed the Indians to do a great number of things in Afghanistan.
[01:39:02.561 --> 01:39:05.762]  By doing that, we've then further destabilized the situation.
[01:39:05.762 --> 01:39:08.603]  This is a situation where we should have asked Indians to just sit it out.
[01:39:08.603 --> 01:39:11.945]  We don't need you there because your presence there will help destabilize things.
[01:39:11.945 --> 01:39:12.485]  Well, no kidding.
[01:39:12.485 --> 01:39:14.926]  That's the ancestral enemy they've had all these wars with.
[01:39:14.926 --> 01:39:15.607]  It's crazy.
[01:39:15.607 --> 01:39:17.187]  I mean, come on.
[01:39:17.187 --> 01:39:23.150]  The Pentagon, the CIA, they've got to know that bringing the Indians in was going to turn the Pakistanis against them.
[01:39:23.749 --> 01:39:24.329]  We did.
[01:39:24.329 --> 01:39:32.973]  And that's why you've seen the Haqqani Network be so effective in retaining its ability to launch operations within Kabul and other parts of Afghanistan.
[01:39:32.973 --> 01:39:35.135]  And the Pakistanis are never going to give it up.
[01:39:35.135 --> 01:39:42.098]  So again, Alex, we've helped create and ferment the destabilization path of Pakistan by our own hand-handed way we've handled it.
[01:39:42.098 --> 01:39:48.541]  And this is one of those things the Pentagon, General McChrystal even said this recently in London, that we barely
[01:39:48.561 --> 01:39:48.841]  No kidding.
[01:39:48.841 --> 01:39:49.461]  What is the inside...
[01:40:08.692 --> 01:40:20.019]  Baseball on an Iran attack because it looks like Obama's playing this whole peacenik angle publicly that he doesn't want war but now after meeting with Netanyahu he says we will take action.
[01:40:20.019 --> 01:40:25.702]  But from everything I've seen it is a strategy of tension, balkanization, order out of chaos.
[01:40:27.743 --> 01:40:29.805]  At many levels, I don't think it's ham-fisted.
[01:40:29.805 --> 01:40:32.487]  Sure, mid-level, some of the bureaucrats.
[01:40:32.487 --> 01:40:42.695]  I mean, this larger strategy looks like it's an attempt to bring the world into turmoil so that there can be distractions from the bank looting and the rest of it.
[01:40:42.695 --> 01:40:45.838]  But what are you hearing on an Iran attack?
[01:40:46.485 --> 01:40:47.485]  Well, they're split.
[01:40:47.485 --> 01:40:50.626]  I mean, clearly, let's just look at the facts here.
[01:40:50.626 --> 01:40:59.648]  One of the key facts, Alex, is that it would take over 300 sorties, that is 300 air missions, to just hit the known nuclear facilities.
[01:40:59.648 --> 01:41:00.808]  The known nuclear facilities.
[01:41:00.808 --> 01:41:05.469]  And obviously, we know that the Iranians have secret nuclear programs.
[01:41:05.469 --> 01:41:07.609]  So, you've got to look at that realistically.
[01:41:07.609 --> 01:41:09.710]  So, we have folks, clearly, who think we could do it.
[01:41:10.750 --> 01:41:12.552]  We have the military capacity.
[01:41:12.552 --> 01:41:18.317]  Obviously, I don't think the Israelis could do it without us for any number of reasons, and I think that's the big debate right now.
[01:41:18.317 --> 01:41:20.159]  Do we go in with them or not?
[01:41:20.159 --> 01:41:21.500]  Do the Israelis want to attack?
[01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:22.521]  There's no doubt they do.
[01:41:22.521 --> 01:41:24.863]  The question becomes, can they and will they?
[01:41:24.863 --> 01:41:32.090]  Ultimately, the other thing we have to look at here is that the Jericho 3, the Israelis' delivery system, is nuclear capable.
[01:41:32.090 --> 01:41:33.912]  The Israelis do have nuclear weapons.
[01:41:34.412 --> 01:41:35.453]  And the push came to shove.
[01:41:35.453 --> 01:41:38.235]  Obviously, they do have the ability to launch nuclear weapons.
[01:41:38.235 --> 01:41:42.818]  Obviously, that would be something that would put the whole region in turmoil.
[01:41:42.818 --> 01:41:43.999]  But we don't want that.
[01:41:43.999 --> 01:41:44.819]  No one wants that.
[01:41:44.819 --> 01:41:50.163]  So, the question becomes, what is the middle course which would help stabilize things and back everybody off?
[01:41:50.163 --> 01:41:53.645]  And that, I think, has to be one where we look at others.
[01:41:53.645 --> 01:41:56.367]  I'm not a proponent of negotiation.
[01:41:56.367 --> 01:41:57.908]  I think it's a day late, a dollar short.
[01:41:57.908 --> 01:42:00.610]  At the same time, I don't think we can afford to do a full-on
[01:42:01.270 --> 01:42:02.850]  Uh, military attack only.
[01:42:02.850 --> 01:42:06.791]  So there's some middle ground, and that middle ground would be, you know, the dark arts.
[01:42:06.791 --> 01:42:11.292]  We've got to look at how we can actually do things without, uh, actually attacking.
[01:42:11.292 --> 01:42:24.134]  One general I've talked to several times, Alex, about this, former central command commander, has said the moment a ship gets scratched going through the Straits of Hormuz, by miscalculation, we're talking about six to seven dollars a gallon oil.
[01:42:24.134 --> 01:42:25.274]  And I think that's realistic.
[01:42:25.274 --> 01:42:29.415]  So we, you know, I don't think the Obama administration really wants that level of expense.
[01:42:30.443 --> 01:42:34.366]  Well, just the saber-rattling's got gas prices exploding.
[01:42:34.366 --> 01:42:35.867]  At $5 or more soon?
[01:42:35.867 --> 01:42:36.908]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:42:36.908 --> 01:42:44.113]  So again, I don't think it's in the administration's best interest to see that, because that will definitely hurt his re-election campaign potential.
[01:42:44.113 --> 01:42:47.155]  So I think if nothing else, they're going to try to keep a lid on this until after the election.
[01:42:47.155 --> 01:42:57.703]  So I see the administration trying to keep this patted down until we're past November, because obviously their big objective right now is to keep oil prices not going too high, even though ultimately they want them high.
[01:42:58.243 --> 01:43:00.846]  But low enough that they get through the election and get re-elected.
[01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:15.641]  Let me expand on this.
[01:43:15.641 --> 01:43:18.122]  How do you expect, and what are your colleagues saying?
[01:43:18.122 --> 01:43:21.284]  What's the consensus, if there is one, on the Russians?
[01:43:21.284 --> 01:43:24.486]  Putin's been re-elected, if you believe that.
[01:43:24.486 --> 01:43:25.766]  Their stocks have gone up.
[01:43:25.766 --> 01:43:28.028]  That means the hardliners are in.
[01:43:28.028 --> 01:43:32.670]  You've got the Chinese president saying prepare for war with the U.S.
[01:43:32.670 --> 01:43:40.895]  You've got the Pentagon acting like the Middle East isn't even an issue and sending all these fleets and troops to the Pacific.
[01:43:40.895 --> 01:43:44.057]  Why is there this realignment against Russia and China right now?
[01:43:46.152 --> 01:43:50.016]  The problem we have, just so I can define it for your audience to understand, we have no grand strategy.
[01:43:50.016 --> 01:43:51.858]  We have no idea what we're doing, globally.
[01:43:51.858 --> 01:43:52.118]  We don't.
[01:43:53.088 --> 01:43:58.113]  And one of the things that even during the Cold War, Alex, we kind of had a strategy of how we're going to do things.
[01:43:58.113 --> 01:43:59.174]  We don't have that.
[01:43:59.174 --> 01:44:01.516]  No one has sat down and figured out how we're going to do things.
[01:44:01.516 --> 01:44:03.217]  All they know is we're going to cut the budget.
[01:44:03.217 --> 01:44:06.160]  With that said, then, we've left the door open for chaos.
[01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:13.446]  You have General Clapper saying one thing in testimony about the Muslim Brotherhood not being a threat, being one thing and another.
[01:44:13.446 --> 01:44:16.629]  At the same time, you've got the military expansion in the Pacific.
[01:44:17.089 --> 01:44:20.953]  So again, I think it's almost like there's nobody really thinking things through.
[01:44:20.953 --> 01:44:23.616]  We're playing checkers, not chess.
[01:44:23.616 --> 01:44:32.466]  So what we need to do now as a country is really force the administration, whoever's in power, trying to figure out what are we actually trying to do with our multi-billion dollar military?
[01:44:32.506 --> 01:44:33.687]  Well, that's my next question.
[01:44:33.687 --> 01:44:38.269]  That's what I see, is you've got all these special interests who all want different things.
[01:44:38.269 --> 01:44:45.492]  And so it's like America's become this robot that's getting all these different orders and smokes coming out of its ears.
[01:44:45.492 --> 01:44:51.314]  And so even though we've had a corrupt elite and problems in this country before, now I'm really starting to agree with you.
[01:44:51.314 --> 01:44:52.695]  And I didn't think this just a few years ago.
[01:44:53.175 --> 01:44:56.717]  I don't think the elites can get their act together as bad as they are.
[01:44:56.717 --> 01:44:57.298]  It's crazy.
[01:44:57.298 --> 01:44:59.779]  They've got all these weapons, all these systems.
[01:44:59.779 --> 01:45:02.381]  They've got level 4 bioweapons development.
[01:45:02.381 --> 01:45:04.182]  They're putting in level 2 facilities.
[01:45:04.182 --> 01:45:07.084]  I mean, it's, it's, they're crazy.
[01:45:07.084 --> 01:45:08.365]  They don't know what they're doing.
[01:45:08.365 --> 01:45:10.206]  Congress is insider trading.
[01:45:10.206 --> 01:45:11.847]  Mistress is partying.
[01:45:11.847 --> 01:45:15.349]  We've had corrupt elites, but at least they were professional in the past.
[01:45:15.349 --> 01:45:16.750]  I think we are getting a bunch of
[01:45:17.290 --> 01:45:21.714]  A bunch of moron, power-tripping, hubris-filled playboys.
[01:45:21.714 --> 01:45:24.276]  And that spells disaster.
[01:45:24.276 --> 01:45:25.457]  That spells war.
[01:45:25.457 --> 01:45:28.439]  That's because... Man, I just have a bad feeling.
[01:45:28.439 --> 01:45:34.544]  I mean, I integrate all the info together, and my gut tells me we are cruising towards calamity.
[01:45:35.327 --> 01:45:35.808]  I agree with you.
[01:45:35.808 --> 01:45:37.029]  And I think that's the problem here, Alex.
[01:45:37.029 --> 01:45:42.375]  We've got to get our act together because you have, like you said, you have huge economic interests in the Pentagon.
[01:45:42.375 --> 01:45:46.960]  One of the reasons we're bogged down in Afghanistan is we know the issue is Pakistan.
[01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:47.380]  We know that.
[01:45:47.380 --> 01:45:54.167]  One of the reasons we're bogged down is because you have something called, my friend, you probably know him, Jerry Doyle, calls it a combat to commerce.
[01:45:54.167 --> 01:45:56.290]  You have people with huge investments.
[01:45:56.890 --> 01:45:57.691]  We're good.
[01:46:12.027 --> 01:46:12.808]  I'm good to go.
[01:46:28.723 --> 01:46:29.683]  Wow.
[01:46:29.683 --> 01:46:31.404]  What does your gut tell you right now?
[01:46:31.404 --> 01:46:40.028]  I mean, I'm not making predictions, but right now, the current course we're on, 60-40, 60 for an Iran attack in the next year, or is it 60% not a war, 40%?
[01:46:40.028 --> 01:46:40.929]  I mean, what's your gut?
[01:46:44.379 --> 01:46:50.882]  I do believe, based on everything I'm hearing and what I believe, there's a better than even chance that there will be an attack before the fall.
[01:46:50.882 --> 01:46:59.167]  I think it'll be towards the fall, and it'll be one of those things that I think there'll be clear indications it's coming, despite the Israelis trying to hide it.
[01:46:59.167 --> 01:47:03.449]  I think that this is patted down probably through the summer, and something will happen this fall.
[01:47:03.449 --> 01:47:07.971]  Like you point out, either everybody will rally around the President, because we have to fall in with the Israelis,
[01:47:08.571 --> 01:47:10.551]  Or the gas prices will drive him out of office.
[01:47:10.551 --> 01:47:11.252]  It could go either way.
[01:47:11.252 --> 01:47:16.553]  And I think that's one of the calculations the White House will continue to try to ascertain within polling.
[01:47:16.553 --> 01:47:20.794]  Again, I believe the President's speech yesterday at the AIPAC was purely political.
[01:47:20.794 --> 01:47:24.114]  It had nothing to do with the national security realities.
[01:47:24.114 --> 01:47:27.275]  If he really was focused on diplomacy, Alex, he should have done that three years ago.
[01:47:27.275 --> 01:47:35.657]  Instead, now, we're behind the power curve, and I think it's all about political equations designed to get him through and get him reelected in November one way or another.
[01:47:36.297 --> 01:47:44.039]  What do you think about admitted George Soros-type State Department programs to destabilize and mess around inside Russia?
[01:47:44.039 --> 01:47:46.980]  I mean, I don't think they're going to be successful doing that.
[01:47:46.980 --> 01:47:55.403]  I think they're going to completely get Russia to unify its elite in an anti-Western stance that'll probably cause more trouble down the road.
[01:47:56.425 --> 01:47:56.585]  Exactly.
[01:48:19.817 --> 01:48:24.558]  And I think we need to look at how, you know, the Russians and us have a lot of common interest if you really sit down and look at it.
[01:48:24.558 --> 01:48:30.359]  So I think we ought to be looking at how we can align interest together to do things to be a, you know, maybe a global ally.
[01:48:30.359 --> 01:48:31.699]  Can you imagine if the U.S.
[01:48:31.699 --> 01:48:34.419]  started becoming a partner and trading with Russia?
[01:48:34.419 --> 01:48:36.100]  It would be great for both economies.
[01:48:36.100 --> 01:48:38.480]  But again, special interests don't want that.
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:42.421]  That's what Ron Paul, people say, well Ron Paul, he wants to be with the Muslim extremists.
[01:48:42.421 --> 01:48:46.401]  No, he understands this empire is on its last legs.
[01:48:46.401 --> 01:48:48.162]  Right.
[01:48:48.162 --> 01:48:49.222]  What's your take on Ron Paul?
[01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:56.442]  Well, you know, I gotta tell you, Alex, I've said this publicly, I think his policy is the most realistic on Iran.
[01:48:56.442 --> 01:49:02.124]  The more we pick him, the more we poke him, the more the people will be apt to unify around the current government.
[01:49:02.124 --> 01:49:04.304]  We don't, we really don't want that.
[01:49:04.304 --> 01:49:12.327]  So I think we need to be very careful to say, look, we are against your government developing and having nuclear weapons which could be used for purposes of creating war.
[01:49:13.127 --> 01:49:16.208]  At the same time, we're not against the Iranian people.
[01:49:16.208 --> 01:49:19.969]  It's a tough thing to do, but we've got to do that.
[01:49:19.969 --> 01:49:32.113]  And I think Ron Paul is right in that we need to look at how we can reach out and negotiate and be involved in trade with powers, and at the same time limit our focus of using force.
[01:49:32.113 --> 01:49:34.614]  I think we're too apt to use force like we did in Libya.
[01:49:36.054 --> 01:49:39.796]  And take a step back and figure out what is really in our interest to do.
[01:49:39.796 --> 01:49:45.399]  So I'm hoping that the other candidates will start listening to Paul and some of his common sense.
[01:49:45.399 --> 01:49:48.440]  At the same time, I think he wants to pull back too much.
[01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:50.581]  I think we need to maintain order.
[01:49:50.581 --> 01:49:52.562]  We are the big dog on the block, so to speak.
[01:49:52.562 --> 01:50:00.486]  I think it is our responsibility to maintain lines of communication, lines of commerce, because it is in the best interest of the world to keep that lifeblood flowing.
[01:50:00.486 --> 01:50:03.127]  And if we don't do it, we allow it to fall to someone else.
[01:50:03.787 --> 01:50:06.748]  I don't think they will be all as kind as we are.
[01:50:19.933 --> 01:50:27.003]  I mean, they're going to bring the whole world into chaos, and it's time for the elite to realize how much danger they've put everybody, including themselves.
[01:50:27.003 --> 01:50:30.628]  Colonel Schaefer, a best-selling author of Operation Dark Heart.
[01:50:30.628 --> 01:50:32.871]  Of course, OperationDarkHeart.com.
[01:50:32.871 --> 01:50:34.474]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[01:50:34.474 --> 01:50:36.136]  Look forward to talking to you in the near future.
[01:50:37.799 --> 01:50:38.139]  You bet.
[01:50:38.139 --> 01:50:38.740]  Great to have you.
[01:50:38.740 --> 01:50:39.661]  Alright, there goes Lt.
[01:50:39.661 --> 01:50:39.921]  Col.
[01:50:39.921 --> 01:50:41.162]  Anthony Schaefer.
[01:50:41.162 --> 01:50:45.366]  Really intelligent, informed guy on a wide spectrum of issues.
[01:50:45.366 --> 01:50:46.227]  I'll hit some other news.
[01:50:46.227 --> 01:50:48.929]  Then we've got a guest joining us from Syria.
[01:50:48.929 --> 01:50:49.970]  That's Syrian girl.
[01:50:49.970 --> 01:50:52.913]  We'll just leave her at that.
[01:50:52.913 --> 01:50:54.114]  Very interesting and informative.
[01:50:54.114 --> 01:50:55.014]  That is coming up.
[01:50:55.014 --> 01:50:57.677]  Then I'm going to air some clips from my Dallas speech.
[01:50:57.677 --> 01:50:59.338]  It's now up in high res at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:51:04.332 --> 01:51:09.495]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[01:51:09.495 --> 01:51:11.376]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[01:51:11.376 --> 01:51:14.898]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with Fake TV.
[01:51:14.898 --> 01:51:22.362]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television, so from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[01:51:22.362 --> 01:51:26.864]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[01:51:26.864 --> 01:51:32.607]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[01:51:32.947 --> 01:51:34.727]  Use it anytime you're away from home.
[01:51:34.727 --> 01:51:40.849]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.

[01:54:22.020 --> 01:54:24.223]  Good old George Strait.
[01:54:24.223 --> 01:54:30.610]  By the way, coming up in the next hour, we're going to have Syrian girl from an undisclosed location joining us.
[01:54:30.610 --> 01:54:34.214]  And she is Syrian, breaking down her perspective on what's happening over there.
[01:54:34.214 --> 01:54:38.119]  We'll put her on screen here for just a moment if people are watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:45.624]  And just so folks can see her there, we'll be going to her again at the start of the next hour.
[01:54:45.624 --> 01:54:46.465]  So there she is on screen.
[01:54:46.465 --> 01:54:49.007]  We'll be talking to her here in about five minutes.
[01:54:49.007 --> 01:54:52.970]  Okay, some of the other news that we've got here.
[01:54:54.392 --> 01:54:55.633]  Obviously that needs to be covered.
[01:54:55.633 --> 01:55:02.159]  In a new Ohio poll, Ron Paul most competitive against Obama.
[01:55:02.159 --> 01:55:07.925]  There's literally hundreds of major polls now in the last year that show him beating Obama better than any other candidate.
[01:55:07.925 --> 01:55:10.347]  But does the GOP leadership want that?
[01:55:10.347 --> 01:55:18.255]  No, they want to go around blocking Ron Paul everywhere because he's the only person that's a real candidate on the Republican ticket who is not completely insane like they are.
[01:55:19.525 --> 01:55:22.366]  Also, Paul Watson's got a report coming out anytime.
[01:55:22.366 --> 01:55:28.508]  In fact, let me hit refresh on InfoWars.com and see what's going on there.
[01:55:28.508 --> 01:55:29.428]  No, it's not up yet.
[01:55:29.428 --> 01:55:34.169]  He's going to have a report very, very soon on all over the United States.
[01:55:34.169 --> 01:55:38.270]  They have military at public events, including Austin, directing everybody.
[01:55:38.270 --> 01:55:39.791]  Just total acclamation for him.
[01:55:41.209 --> 01:55:46.013]  Marshall Law, some of the other articles at InfoWars.com, H.R.
[01:55:46.013 --> 01:55:57.483]  347, another step in the elimination of the First Amendment, NATO invasion of Syria set for this month, Paul Joseph Watson, big article, but it's not an invasion, it's a peace mission, like Libya.
[01:55:57.483 --> 01:56:06.872]  That's all part of the Orwellian nature, and if you question that admitted lie, that, no, that's a war, it's not peace, they're like, shut up, conspiracy theorist, questioning anything we say is evil.
[01:56:07.907 --> 01:56:13.108]  Obama's second term, odds spur a rush of gun buying.
[01:56:13.108 --> 01:56:18.649]  Record gun sales, and people say, we don't trust the President, we think he's a criminal, in major studies.
[01:56:18.649 --> 01:56:20.350]  And they say they're worried about collapse.
[01:56:20.350 --> 01:56:24.831]  Again, Globalist, we've been there warning people, you're not going to get the jump on us.
[01:56:24.831 --> 01:56:26.171]  Don't try to start a civil war.
[01:56:26.171 --> 01:56:28.451]  The police and military are going to join us.
[01:56:28.451 --> 01:56:30.672]  I can guarantee you the military is.
[01:56:30.672 --> 01:56:33.132]  70 plus percent give their money to Ron Paul and the military.
[01:56:33.132 --> 01:56:34.573]  They give money.
[01:56:34.573 --> 01:56:35.913]  Boy, that's got the system.
[01:56:37.029 --> 01:56:37.469]  Worried.
[01:56:37.469 --> 01:56:40.610]  You may be able to steal the election from Ron Paul, and I told folks that was going to happen.
[01:56:40.610 --> 01:56:44.052]  You still got to support him because he gets the word out.
[01:56:44.052 --> 01:56:46.693]  But he is the real nominee.
[01:56:46.693 --> 01:56:50.935]  Continuing, Afghanistan failed war from a false empire.
[01:56:50.935 --> 01:56:53.396]  Holders justify killing Americans on foreign soil.
[01:56:53.396 --> 01:56:55.536]  And we have that other big report here.
[01:56:55.536 --> 01:56:55.876]  U.S.
[01:56:55.876 --> 01:56:59.358]  court approves warrantless searches of your cell phones when the cops pull you over.
[01:57:00.430 --> 01:57:04.676]  So that's some of the crazy news on that front.
[01:57:04.676 --> 01:57:10.123]  I may have to suspend this because I don't have the money to hire more shipping people.
[01:57:10.123 --> 01:57:13.367]  We got like 600 orders over the weekend for the 100 Infowars
[01:57:17.301 --> 01:57:22.646]  Business cards, two bumper stickers, and a citizen rule book for one penny.
[01:57:22.646 --> 01:57:26.710]  All you pay is the $4.95 for shipping, and that is the shipping cost, is $4.95.
[01:57:26.710 --> 01:57:31.114]  Because, I mean, at this rate, they can only ship about 300, 400 orders a day.
[01:57:31.114 --> 01:57:32.455]  It's going to cause a problem.
[01:57:32.455 --> 01:57:38.061]  I'm going to keep it up there for a little bit longer, and then maybe increase the price just a little bit, because I can't even...
[01:57:39.349 --> 01:57:42.170]  I'll lose even more money if I hire more people and then try to ship it out.
[01:57:42.170 --> 01:57:45.851]  It's one thing to give stuff out at cost, but I can't lose money or we won't be here.
[01:57:45.851 --> 01:57:48.672]  And we got a bunch of deals on the website.
[01:57:48.672 --> 01:57:50.813]  I'm leaving up one more day and it is going.
[01:57:50.813 --> 01:57:55.375]  All my films for $99 plus Jason Burmess' film, normally $380.
[01:57:55.375 --> 01:58:01.357]  So that's a 70 plus percent discount and that will end tonight just because they're overwhelmed back there.
[01:58:01.357 --> 01:58:03.077]  And they said that we have to change it now.
[01:58:03.077 --> 01:58:04.958]  We promised it will be gone tomorrow.
[01:58:04.958 --> 01:58:07.119]  So they got to put a new special up when that's gone.
[01:58:08.118 --> 01:58:11.000]  It's gonna go up to like $165 for all of them tomorrow.
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:12.021]  Still a great deal.
[01:58:12.021 --> 01:58:13.342]  So, InfoWars.com.

[01:59:53.809 --> 01:59:56.192]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.192 --> 01:59:58.976]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.649 --> 02:00:10.471]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.471 --> 02:00:12.072]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.072 --> 02:00:13.613]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.613 --> 02:00:17.795]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.795 --> 02:00:21.897]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:28.251 --> 02:00:34.634]  Alright, we're joined for the next 30 minutes by a young lady who goes by the name of Syrian Girl.
[02:00:34.634 --> 02:00:41.996]  And of course, when we ended up getting her contact in, folks, I've seen her on a couple different YouTube channels speaking out very eloquently, I thought, I bet she's a listener.
[02:00:41.996 --> 02:00:43.037]  And sure enough, she is.
[02:00:43.897 --> 02:00:47.879]  And we're honored to have her for the next 30 minutes joining us here on the radio.
[02:00:47.879 --> 02:00:51.500]  And of course, people can watch her if they're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:00:51.500 --> 02:00:55.801]  She comes just from an undisclosed location for her safety.
[02:00:55.801 --> 02:00:58.823]  The West is funding the attempted overthrow of Assad.
[02:00:58.823 --> 02:01:00.463]  Not saying he's a wonderful guy.
[02:01:00.463 --> 02:01:04.285]  The point is, they're trying to use al-Qaeda and others, al-Syiata, to do this.
[02:01:04.285 --> 02:01:07.866]  And Syrian Girl joins us to go over this.
[02:01:07.866 --> 02:01:10.067]  This is a short segment, as you know.
[02:01:11.327 --> 02:01:27.186]  Tell us a little bit about yourself and what you believe, you know, having a family in Syria, what the real score is, what's really happening there, because obviously it's another proxy war just like Libya, but what's your view on the whole situation as a Syrian?
[02:01:28.595 --> 02:01:30.957]  Well, that's exactly right.
[02:01:30.957 --> 02:01:46.032]  It's a proxy war being waged by NATO, the Arab countries, spearheaded by Qatar, which has the biggest US military base in the region, right there, and they control Al Jazeera.
[02:01:46.032 --> 02:01:47.653]  I'm not sure if you're familiar with that.
[02:01:48.354 --> 02:02:08.973]  satellite news channel but it was in the media a lot during the Iraq war and it was proposed as a anti-US media station and it was, you know, so much hoo-ha about how evil Al Jazeera is but in actual fact
[02:02:09.946 --> 02:02:11.687]  It was controlled by the U.S.
[02:02:11.687 --> 02:02:12.828]  all along.
[02:02:12.828 --> 02:02:34.203]  They're allies, and this Al Jazeera is currently the driving force, the media driving force behind all of these foreign-fueled insurgencies that is being referred to as the Arab Spring.
[02:02:34.203 --> 02:02:35.584]  Well, I have to concur with that.
[02:02:36.892 --> 02:02:56.491]  I mean, it's so clear whenever I'm watching CNN with Anderson Cooper, the same guy that cheered the overthrow of their old puppet in Egypt and then cheered the humanitarian bombing and tens of thousands killed against Libya, to see him cutting to this particular young man, reporter who's there, who one day is speaking in a
[02:02:57.071 --> 02:02:58.592]  Yes, I am in Syria.
[02:02:58.592 --> 02:03:00.154]  And then the next day he has a British accent.
[02:03:00.154 --> 02:03:08.201]  I mean, clearly it's actors giving us babies being killed out of incubators, Libyan rape gangs raping the women.
[02:03:08.201 --> 02:03:09.482]  Turned out that was a lie.
[02:03:09.482 --> 02:03:13.225]  I mean, it's clear dumbed-down war propaganda.
[02:03:13.225 --> 02:03:18.009]  What is it like for you, being Syrian, watching all this unfold?
[02:03:18.009 --> 02:03:19.971]  It's quite infuriating.
[02:03:19.971 --> 02:03:23.454]  But from a very young age,
[02:03:24.653 --> 02:03:32.822]  You know, when the Iraq war was starting and what happened in Libya, I always knew that one day Syria's turn would come.
[02:03:32.822 --> 02:03:37.267]  So in some ways I'm quite prepared for it.
[02:03:37.267 --> 02:03:42.172]  But the drive to act is still there.
[02:03:42.172 --> 02:03:44.655]  You know, it's really upsetting when
[02:03:46.738 --> 02:04:00.891]  Your family is there and their living condition is getting worse and worse and you know you'd like to go there and see them but because of the current situation with your
[02:04:03.871 --> 02:04:08.878]  You know, bombings happening and insurgents running around.
[02:04:08.878 --> 02:04:13.023]  It makes it difficult, to say the least.
[02:04:13.023 --> 02:04:19.732]  So from a personal position, it's both infuriating and saddening.
[02:04:21.530 --> 02:04:27.014]  Well now, as you know, NATO and others are talking about starting a humanitarian blockade and air campaign.
[02:04:27.014 --> 02:04:30.316]  We saw how humanitarian Libya was.
[02:04:30.316 --> 02:04:37.882]  When we come back, I want to expand on this, ask you what your family thinks of what's going on, and the future of Syria, because they've wrecked Libya.
[02:04:37.882 --> 02:04:43.586]  It's now a hellhole from being the jewel of Africa with development, and that's what the banksters want.
[02:04:43.586 --> 02:04:44.626]  They want to destroy countries.
[02:04:45.487 --> 02:04:47.028]  So they can come in and take them over.
[02:04:47.028 --> 02:04:53.934]  And I want to get your view on what the average Syrian you talk to's real perspective is on President Assad.
[02:04:53.934 --> 02:04:55.936]  It's all coming up with Syrian Girl.
[02:04:55.936 --> 02:04:56.836]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:04:56.836 --> 02:04:57.317]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.950 --> 02:05:05.493]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:05.493 --> 02:05:06.413]  Number one.
[02:05:06.413 --> 02:05:09.836]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:09.836 --> 02:05:10.696]  Number two.
[02:05:10.696 --> 02:05:15.579]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:15.579 --> 02:05:16.340]  It's true.
[02:05:16.340 --> 02:05:21.203]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:21.203 --> 02:05:22.023]  Number three.
[02:05:22.023 --> 02:05:25.606]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:25.606 --> 02:05:29.308]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:29.508 --> 02:05:30.308]  Number 4.
[02:05:30.308 --> 02:05:33.069]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:33.069 --> 02:05:36.750]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:36.750 --> 02:05:37.550]  Number 5.
[02:05:37.550 --> 02:05:41.691]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:41.691 --> 02:05:46.733]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:05:46.733 --> 02:05:50.714]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:50.914 --> 02:05:52.698]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:05:52.698 --> 02:05:54.943]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:05:54.943 --> 02:05:57.308]  So go to MySolarBackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:06:02.642 --> 02:06:06.603]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.

[02:07:01.064 --> 02:07:02.144]  I had tried everything.
[02:07:02.144 --> 02:07:07.626]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[02:07:07.626 --> 02:07:12.447]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[02:07:12.447 --> 02:07:18.829]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.

[02:08:02.034 --> 02:08:04.821]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.821 --> 02:08:07.608]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.956 --> 02:08:20.037]  We are live.
[02:08:20.037 --> 02:08:21.900]  It is Monday, the 5th day of March 2012.
[02:08:21.900 --> 02:08:32.453]  Gonna have a big nightly news tonight and a little surprise interview with Dave Mustaine here in studio with us, but I'm gonna leave that as a surprise.
[02:08:33.596 --> 02:08:35.117]  Dave Mustaine here in town.
[02:08:35.117 --> 02:08:36.017]  It's really cool.
[02:08:36.017 --> 02:08:37.018]  It's interesting.
[02:08:37.018 --> 02:08:40.840]  Get up in the morning and Dave Mustaine's, you know, drinking coffee in your kitchen.
[02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:41.420]  It's pretty cool.
[02:08:41.420 --> 02:08:42.260]  I'm not name-dropping.
[02:08:42.260 --> 02:08:43.541]  It's just really interesting.
[02:08:43.541 --> 02:08:47.162]  Of all the famous people I know, he's gotta be one of the most interesting.
[02:08:47.162 --> 02:08:49.844]  Really an amazing guy in person, in private.
[02:08:50.804 --> 02:08:57.450]  But I'm gonna try the interview to get him to talk about you some of the things you can see the real Dave Mustaine Really interesting obviously a very talented person.
[02:08:57.450 --> 02:09:15.426]  I think number one Hard rock metal guitarist of all time, and he's in the top ten guitarist period according to Rolling Stone and others He certainly is amazing and of course his wife is so sweet and intelligent as well great Christian people we're joined by a woman who goes with the name of Syrian girl and
[02:09:16.138 --> 02:09:16.198]  Yes.
[02:09:34.464 --> 02:09:36.325]  Uh, and, uh, she joins us now.
[02:09:36.325 --> 02:09:39.547]  Recap the point you make about Al-Syeda.
[02:09:39.547 --> 02:09:51.833]  I just had Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer, who ran the bin Laden program trying to kill him, who was blocked from killing him, pointing out that Amir al-Awlaki, who's run all the big terror attacks in the U.S., is really a Pentagon double agent, White House agent.
[02:09:51.833 --> 02:09:53.934]  Now, that's Colonel Schaefer.
[02:09:53.934 --> 02:09:56.175]  You'd think that'd be big news.
[02:09:56.175 --> 02:09:56.516]  Uh, but...
[02:09:58.677 --> 02:10:05.981]  So break down your view, what's happening, break down the view in Syria of what people think of Al-Qaeda.
[02:10:05.981 --> 02:10:12.204]  Okay, so in Syria everybody knows that Al-Qaeda is the CIA.
[02:10:12.204 --> 02:10:14.546]  It's really, really common knowledge.
[02:10:14.546 --> 02:10:18.648]  You can ask any kid on the street and he'll tell you that.
[02:10:18.648 --> 02:10:26.152]  So it's not really like what you just said, though I haven't heard about it, it doesn't surprise me at all because
[02:10:27.045 --> 02:10:38.529]  There's so much information out there already of people that turned out to be double agents that were captured and were supposed to be part of Al-Qaeda.
[02:10:38.529 --> 02:10:39.670]  Go over that, because I've seen you.
[02:10:39.670 --> 02:10:46.953]  You have a great knowledge of it, the history of it, some of the examples of proving it's Al-Qaeda.
[02:10:46.953 --> 02:10:54.215]  Well, first of all, you have one of the Libyan rebel leaders
[02:10:57.455 --> 02:11:09.685]  Turns out he was tortured in Guantanamo Bay and he's part of Al-Qaeda and we all know that NATO and the US, you know, they supported the Libyan rebels.
[02:11:09.685 --> 02:11:21.975]  So there are, you know, one of the big signs now, which is what I mentioned in my video, is that they're actually working with Al-Qaeda in these countries that we're seeing insurgencies.
[02:11:21.975 --> 02:11:24.617]  So Libya was one of them.
[02:11:24.617 --> 02:11:24.737]  And
[02:11:26.374 --> 02:11:44.648]  In Syria, also, there are videos now coming out of some of the protesters and some of the people in the so-called Free Syrian Army, which is what the insurgents, the name they give themselves, carrying Al-Qaeda flags.
[02:11:44.648 --> 02:11:48.070]  And these are, like, widely available on YouTube.
[02:11:48.070 --> 02:11:52.734]  You can just search for it and it's there.
[02:11:52.734 --> 02:11:55.596]  If I can go on another big indicator,
[02:11:56.860 --> 02:12:18.330]  would be Al Jazeera, who's, since the very beginning, was the only station that was able to get video of Osama Bin Laden giving speeches and was the only one that was able to play them or desired to play them.
[02:12:18.330 --> 02:12:22.692]  And, you know, whenever we heard about Al Qaeda, it was always from Al Jazeera.
[02:12:23.092 --> 02:12:25.634]  You know, they're here, they're there.
[02:12:25.634 --> 02:12:27.215]  It was the thing that was promoting them.
[02:12:27.215 --> 02:12:29.857]  And who controls Al Jazeera?
[02:12:29.857 --> 02:12:30.838]  Well, Qatar.
[02:12:30.838 --> 02:12:33.920]  You know, because it's Qatar's state TV.
[02:12:33.920 --> 02:12:38.063]  Who is sending special forces everywhere to try to overthrow Libya?
[02:12:38.063 --> 02:12:40.425]  You name it, bringing in Al Qaeda.
[02:12:40.425 --> 02:12:47.710]  And as you're pointing out, that's why Qaddafi knew to try to jam Al Jazeera, because they were beaming in pro-war stuff.
[02:12:47.710 --> 02:12:48.531]  It's so obvious.
[02:12:49.735 --> 02:12:54.537]  Yeah, it's very obvious, and it was obvious from the very, very beginning.
[02:12:54.537 --> 02:13:04.462]  Like, eight years ago, or maybe it was more than eight years ago, when Al Jazeera even started, you could tell by the way they reported things.
[02:13:04.462 --> 02:13:08.243]  The word is, it's total British intelligence, the whole thing.
[02:13:08.243 --> 02:13:09.284]  Yeah, pretty much.
[02:13:10.501 --> 02:13:12.103]  Are they US or British?
[02:13:12.103 --> 02:13:12.663]  Israeli.
[02:13:12.663 --> 02:13:18.869]  It doesn't really matter because they're all one entity working, you know, together.
[02:13:18.869 --> 02:13:22.092]  Israel and the country Qatar, they're allies.
[02:13:22.092 --> 02:13:23.654]  They're allies with the US.
[02:13:23.654 --> 02:13:24.594]  They control each other.
[02:13:24.594 --> 02:13:27.637]  So it's like one big monster.
[02:13:27.637 --> 02:13:27.998]  That's right.
[02:13:27.998 --> 02:13:31.441]  Continuing with Al-Qaeda examples from the Syrian perspective.
[02:13:35.031 --> 02:13:39.953]  You know, it's, when you're on the spot, it's difficult to think of the list, there's just so many.
[02:13:39.953 --> 02:13:52.439]  I'd like to, this is maybe not an Al Qaeda example, but it's a very important example of false flag operations.
[02:13:52.439 --> 02:14:01.103]  I'm not sure if anybody remembers, but in Iraq, in Basra, two British soldiers, like special forces soldiers,
[02:14:01.943 --> 02:14:11.830]  were captured, dressed up as Arabs, shooting at Iraqi police, which was by then under the control of the occupation.
[02:14:11.830 --> 02:14:16.353]  And they were dressed in black to mimic sort of like the Mehdi Army.
[02:14:16.353 --> 02:14:19.376]  And their car was filled with explosives.
[02:14:19.376 --> 02:14:20.817]  And this was all over the news.
[02:14:22.369 --> 02:14:31.796]  And the British Army were, you know, the British leadership were so panicked about it that they sent the army in to destroy and level the entire police station.
[02:14:31.796 --> 02:14:35.399]  This is a police station that was allied with them to get these men out.
[02:14:35.399 --> 02:14:36.400]  And they did.
[02:14:36.400 --> 02:14:42.925]  But you can imagine what they knew and what they were doing dressed up as Arabs attacking their supposed allies.
[02:14:45.424 --> 02:14:46.845]  So, um... Well, you're right.
[02:14:46.845 --> 02:14:59.471]  In fact, while you're talking, I just talked British soldiers captured in Basra, and it's Global Research, London Independent, BBC, and it's them with their fake Wahhabist beards running around reportedly shooting
[02:15:00.874 --> 02:15:01.275]  I don't
[02:15:19.594 --> 02:15:20.174]  I think?
[02:15:36.863 --> 02:15:39.224]  On some of these sites, it's the images of them with the fake beards.
[02:15:39.224 --> 02:15:40.804]  We'll find it and show it to people.
[02:15:40.804 --> 02:15:42.405]  But yes, that was a great example.
[02:15:42.405 --> 02:15:47.386]  And I even had former top CIA analyst Ray McGovern on, Syrian girl, at the time.
[02:15:47.386 --> 02:15:54.848]  And he pointed out examples where it was confirmed that the Golden Mosque was blown up by Western forces to get the people killing each other.
[02:15:54.848 --> 02:16:00.329]  Can you break down that Sunni-Shiite rivalry that the West likes to manipulate?
[02:16:01.340 --> 02:16:02.981]  Sure thing.
[02:16:02.981 --> 02:16:05.282]  It's just, you know, divide and conquer.
[02:16:05.282 --> 02:16:11.406]  It's just like the old war game applied to Shiites and Sunnis.
[02:16:11.406 --> 02:16:15.168]  I mean, you can apply the same thing to Catholics and Protestants.
[02:16:16.840 --> 02:16:37.678]  So at the moment Iran and Lebanon has a Shia-like population and they form an alliance with Syria and they have Hezbollah which is directly opposing Israel.
[02:16:37.678 --> 02:16:43.624]  So on the one hand they are enemies of the Shia and then you have the Palestinians
[02:16:44.164 --> 02:16:48.206]  who are Sunni, who are also fighting Israel.
[02:16:48.206 --> 02:16:55.029]  So on the other hand, the Israelis are against the Sunnis as well.
[02:16:55.029 --> 02:16:58.911]  So in Iraq, the Americans
[02:17:01.343 --> 02:17:08.468]  allied themselves with a lot of the Shia, although there were a lot of Sunni collaborators as well.
[02:17:08.468 --> 02:17:09.789]  That should be noted.
[02:17:09.789 --> 02:17:18.676]  But they wanted to get the Shia in power over the Sunnis because it was beneficial for them.
[02:17:18.676 --> 02:17:20.077]  It was a way in.
[02:17:20.077 --> 02:17:26.462]  And they got muscled out by the Iranians, but that's another story.
[02:17:26.462 --> 02:17:27.863]  But around the Middle East,
[02:17:29.032 --> 02:17:47.527]  It is mostly the Sunni-majority countries, which are in the Gulf Arab region and in North Africa, not the Levant region where we're from, but mostly they are allowed in.
[02:17:49.397 --> 02:17:50.238]  I was saying that
[02:18:05.700 --> 02:18:14.303]  The Al-Qaeda is purported to be a Sunni organization, but not exactly Sunni.
[02:18:14.303 --> 02:18:22.645]  Something worse, more extreme, called Salafi, or Wahhabi, is another extreme sect.
[02:18:22.645 --> 02:18:23.866]  They're very similar.
[02:18:25.967 --> 02:18:39.499]  At the same time, the majority of Sunni theocratic countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar and the Gulf Arab states are actually allies with the U.S.
[02:18:39.499 --> 02:18:44.324]  So it's a really complicated mess, but in whatever country,
[02:18:46.243 --> 02:18:46.663]  The U.S.
[02:18:46.663 --> 02:18:54.907]  doesn't care which side it plays, whether it plays Shias and gives them power against Sunnis or gives Sunnis power against Shia.
[02:18:54.907 --> 02:18:59.730]  At the end of the day, they want to divide everybody and get everybody fighting.
[02:18:59.730 --> 02:19:04.552]  And I think sometimes they're succeeding, but not in all cases.
[02:19:05.802 --> 02:19:09.464]  By the way, I did find the BBC article, Iraq probe into soldier incident.
[02:19:09.464 --> 02:19:15.588]  It's got them with the guns, hand grenades, fake wigs, out reportedly attacking Basra police.
[02:19:15.588 --> 02:19:20.472]  And there was other cases of US forces being attacked by guys dressed up in Bin Laden outfits.
[02:19:20.472 --> 02:19:21.873]  This is full spectrum dominance.
[02:19:21.873 --> 02:19:26.716]  You've got to manufacture the war so people really believe Al Qaeda exists.
[02:19:26.716 --> 02:19:34.201]  And if you've got to dress up special forces to get the job done and attack the Shiites to get them killing Sunnis, well, by golly, you do it.
[02:19:35.061 --> 02:19:37.463]  And, uh, just incredible.
[02:19:37.463 --> 02:19:39.024]  And then the Iraqis were holding them.
[02:19:39.024 --> 02:19:41.866]  This is our supposed ally saying, look, they were attacking.
[02:19:41.866 --> 02:19:42.607]  We're gonna have a trial.
[02:19:42.607 --> 02:19:45.849]  So they just had the British troops attack the base.
[02:19:45.849 --> 02:19:51.253]  Tell a bunch of, uh, Iraqi troops that were trained by the British to get them out of there.
[02:19:56.916 --> 02:19:58.217]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:58.217 --> 02:20:01.299]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv are the websites.
[02:20:01.299 --> 02:20:03.641]  What is the most abundant resource on Earth?
[02:20:03.641 --> 02:20:04.181]  Water.
[02:20:04.181 --> 02:20:07.604]  It's essential for sustaining life, but it's not always the most available.
[02:20:07.604 --> 02:20:14.388]  When disaster strikes, water quickly vanishes from store shelves, like it did during 9-11, Katrina, Japan, and in Joplin.
[02:20:14.388 --> 02:20:17.130]  Three days without water and your body begins to shut down.
[02:20:17.130 --> 02:20:21.053]  Don't risk being without an abundant supply of water when the next disaster hits.
[02:20:21.053 --> 02:20:22.454]  Get a Flo-Jack hand well pump.

[02:21:57.503 --> 02:21:59.324]  Working to keep the world tied together.
[02:22:00.658 --> 02:22:07.802]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[02:22:07.802 --> 02:22:25.511]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:22:25.511 --> 02:22:29.613]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[02:22:29.893 --> 02:22:31.634]  And discovered Young-Jevity.

[02:23:53.899 --> 02:23:55.299]  What if I say I'm not like the others?
[02:23:55.299 --> 02:23:57.300]  What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
[02:23:57.300 --> 02:23:58.881]  You're a presenter, I'm one of my fans.
[02:24:19.401 --> 02:24:21.102]  Syrian Girl joins us.
[02:24:21.102 --> 02:24:23.904]  Syrian Girl, what is the feeling of people in Syria?
[02:24:23.904 --> 02:24:26.346]  I mean, are they... I mean, this is an invasion.
[02:24:26.346 --> 02:24:31.610]  This is proxy armies, Arab fighters, the ones that were in Libya, being brought in to invade your country.
[02:24:31.610 --> 02:24:33.712]  This is part of the proxy wars.
[02:24:33.712 --> 02:24:37.475]  They admit that they got military paid off defecting over to try to overthrow the country.
[02:24:38.155 --> 02:24:39.916]  And then I guess bring these purges in.
[02:24:39.916 --> 02:24:46.860]  They're saying they're going to kill minority groups of Muslims that are part of smaller sects.
[02:24:46.860 --> 02:24:49.462]  They're also saying they're going to force the Christians out of Syria.
[02:24:49.462 --> 02:24:57.487]  How do you think the West is going to be able to sell this to the public when they do what they've done in your country, the same thing they've done in Libya?
[02:24:59.301 --> 02:25:08.527]  Our people are not going to buy it because our people have a very long memory and we remember what happened and we won't forget what they're doing now.
[02:25:08.527 --> 02:25:16.172]  I don't need to tell you that they're not buying it because you can see it yourself.
[02:25:16.892 --> 02:25:19.413]  No, it's been 12 months now.
[02:25:19.413 --> 02:25:23.753]  There haven't been any mass, you know, rallies.
[02:25:23.753 --> 02:25:36.896]  There haven't been any support for this foreign armed, funded, and even oftentimes the men themselves are foreign.
[02:25:36.896 --> 02:25:38.596]  There's just no support for it.
[02:25:38.596 --> 02:25:45.958]  So, you know, this is nothing to do with whether or not they agree with the government or not.
[02:25:47.281 --> 02:25:57.817]  People who oppose the government know what's going on, so I don't see them selling it to Syrians at all.
[02:25:57.817 --> 02:25:59.700]  For me, I can't see them
[02:26:00.777 --> 02:26:12.160]  Having any way forward unless they attack, unless they do as they're saying, which is to get NATO and have a no-fly zone or an invasion.
[02:26:12.160 --> 02:26:15.921]  And how are they going to do that when Russia's not going to let them?
[02:26:15.921 --> 02:26:19.922]  I don't see a way forward for them.
[02:26:19.922 --> 02:26:21.503]  Continue.
[02:26:21.503 --> 02:26:23.983]  Okay.
[02:26:23.983 --> 02:26:29.225]  In terms of Syrians and how we feel, we're
[02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:36.005]  We're both afraid and excited.
[02:26:36.005 --> 02:26:40.491]  I know that once the war starts, I know where I'm going to be.
[02:26:40.491 --> 02:26:47.059]  And, you know, we're ready to defend our land to the end.
[02:26:47.059 --> 02:26:50.183]  And we think that Israel
[02:26:52.012 --> 02:26:54.873]  Better not think that it's going to be left out of that global war.
[02:26:54.873 --> 02:27:00.334]  It's, you know, it's going to be directly in the line of fire.
[02:27:00.334 --> 02:27:02.715]  If Syria is going, then so are they.
[02:27:02.715 --> 02:27:07.976]  Our enemies are numerous, but we also have some very good friends.
[02:27:07.976 --> 02:27:13.777]  So, Syria is not going down without a fight.
[02:27:13.777 --> 02:27:15.338]  That's what I'd like to be known.
[02:27:16.536 --> 02:27:19.437]  What about the Russian fleet that's docked there at your port?
[02:27:19.437 --> 02:27:31.542]  What about the fact that Russia says, well, they vetoed the UN attack, and so now they're saying, well, we'll go ahead, and now the UN's saying they'll go ahead and get behind it and not even follow the rules.
[02:27:31.542 --> 02:27:35.084]  I mean, this is crazy, a major escalation.
[02:27:35.084 --> 02:27:36.824]  You mean NATO, yeah?
[02:27:36.824 --> 02:27:37.105]  Yes.
[02:27:40.911 --> 02:27:56.959]  Russia's, for Syria, for Russia, Syria is a red line and that's because their base in Tartus, their naval base, is one of their last positions in the Middle East and their last defense against
[02:27:58.520 --> 02:28:02.421]  Uh, Europe and Turkey's missile defense treaty.
[02:28:02.421 --> 02:28:18.807]  So for Russia, it's very important to maintain the relationship with Syria and not have Syria be taken over yet, you know, be another one to fall to the US and NATO sphere of influence.
[02:28:18.807 --> 02:28:18.987]  So
[02:28:20.140 --> 02:28:31.863]  If Russia's not going to back down, and if they're going to disobey the rules, the only foreseeable conclusion to that would be World War III.
[02:28:31.863 --> 02:28:41.306]  I certainly don't doubt that they're prepared for it, and that they will do it.
[02:28:41.306 --> 02:28:46.107]  Whether nuclear bombs are involved, I don't know.
[02:28:48.034 --> 02:28:53.738]  Well, remember, it was an Israeli Prime Minister that tried to make a deal with Syria, a peace treaty, and he got murdered.
[02:28:53.738 --> 02:28:56.840]  And there's a lot of interests that don't want peace.
[02:28:56.840 --> 02:28:59.843]  But undoubtedly, you can say what you want about Assad.
[02:28:59.843 --> 02:29:09.150]  The West is sending in al-Qaeda and others to overthrow the country and calling them protesters when they are the ones starting it and shooting people.
[02:29:09.150 --> 02:29:12.713]  And the West isn't doing this to try to bring more freedom to Syria.
[02:29:12.713 --> 02:29:14.114]  They want to destabilize it.
[02:29:14.694 --> 02:29:19.478]  What percentage of the Syrians, would you say, on average, are supporting the government now?
[02:29:19.478 --> 02:29:27.704]  I saw some numbers that, even though... Well, let's do a few more minutes after the break, then we'll get to some excerpts of my speech in Dallas, because this is so important.
[02:29:27.704 --> 02:29:31.027]  So I want to ask you that question, Syrian girl, after the break.
[02:29:31.027 --> 02:29:34.029]  I know you're private and are just doing this because you don't want your country to be attacked.
[02:29:34.029 --> 02:29:35.751]  It's already being attacked by proxies.
[02:29:35.751 --> 02:29:36.111]  You don't want to...
[02:29:36.451 --> 02:29:45.276]  Say who you are, how folks can contact you, but think about that if you want to give out any contact info or email to people that might want to talk to you when we come back on the other side.
[02:29:45.276 --> 02:29:50.379]  Because InfoWars certainly doesn't want to hoard you to ourselves here.
[02:29:50.379 --> 02:29:51.780]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.780 --> 02:29:54.321]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.321 --> 02:29:56.983]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.189 --> 02:30:02.509]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:30:02.509 --> 02:30:08.091]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:30:08.091 --> 02:30:13.113]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:30:13.113 --> 02:30:13.573]  It's true.
[02:30:13.573 --> 02:30:18.135]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:30:18.675 --> 02:30:23.899]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[02:33:21.597 --> 02:33:22.037]  to 2 p.m.
[02:33:22.037 --> 02:33:22.917]  That's 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[02:33:22.917 --> 02:33:23.578]  Eastern.
[02:33:23.578 --> 02:33:25.499]  Back Sundays, 4 to 6.
[02:33:25.499 --> 02:33:32.222]  Weeknights, InfoWars Nightly News, 7 o'clock Central at InfoWarsNews.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:33:34.872 --> 02:33:35.953]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:33:35.953 --> 02:33:39.935]  We're going to have four or five more minutes with Syrian girl, obviously want to have her back up in the near future.
[02:33:39.935 --> 02:33:42.417]  She's very informed, very articulate.
[02:33:42.417 --> 02:33:48.021]  And we're also going to try to get some other guests on, journalists who've been going to Syria, just like we did with what happened in Libya.
[02:33:48.021 --> 02:33:49.702]  Tarpley went over to Syria a while back.
[02:33:50.242 --> 02:33:51.922]  We're going to get him back on about that.
[02:33:51.922 --> 02:33:55.403]  But undoubtedly, this is a proxy war.
[02:33:55.403 --> 02:33:57.804]  And what is your view of Assad?
[02:33:57.804 --> 02:34:00.545]  I mean, again, how popular is he really?
[02:34:00.545 --> 02:34:08.987]  And what do you expect to happen if the proxy war continues, if the love bomb bombardment, the trendy illegal
[02:34:10.167 --> 02:34:17.352]  Peace bombing begins by NATO and I mean now saying they can't even get the UN resolution.
[02:34:17.352 --> 02:34:18.053]  So just go ahead.
[02:34:18.053 --> 02:34:22.236]  I mean first Obama said I'll attack Libya with a UN resolution, not Congress.
[02:34:22.236 --> 02:34:23.957]  Now they can't even get the UN.
[02:34:23.957 --> 02:34:25.859]  I mean this is so lawless.
[02:34:25.859 --> 02:34:28.861]  This is preemptive war through proxies.
[02:34:28.861 --> 02:34:38.748]  Imagine a foreign country coming and stirring up groups to attack us over the border and then calling them freedom fighters and then calling it protest when people are militarily attacking.
[02:34:41.874 --> 02:34:48.656]  Well, first of all, I want to say the road to hell is paved in good intentions.
[02:34:48.656 --> 02:35:02.280]  The most annoying people are the ones that think that they're helping us out by supporting these insurgents that are bombing, forcing people from their homes.
[02:35:04.460 --> 02:35:09.204]  As far as my opinion on the government, I will get to it.
[02:35:09.204 --> 02:35:16.429]  But more importantly, I want to discuss Syria as a whole.
[02:35:16.429 --> 02:35:17.690]  Okay, we got five minutes left.
[02:35:17.690 --> 02:35:18.951]  I'm giving you the floor then.
[02:35:18.951 --> 02:35:20.972]  Syria as a whole and then Assad.
[02:35:20.972 --> 02:35:22.053]  Any other points you want to make?
[02:35:22.053 --> 02:35:24.715]  Because this is riveting information.
[02:35:24.715 --> 02:35:27.077]  Okay, thank you.
[02:35:27.077 --> 02:35:27.958]  Syria as a whole.
[02:35:29.190 --> 02:35:32.573]  How can I tell you statistics, percentages?
[02:35:32.573 --> 02:35:33.233]  I can't.
[02:35:33.233 --> 02:35:47.964]  I can only tell you that the vast majority of the country, in spite of how they feel about the government, do not want this NATO-led insurgency to take over because
[02:35:48.624 --> 02:35:57.610]  Not only are they going to be puppets of the West, not only are they going to destroy the country in the process of doing so, they're also not democratic.
[02:35:57.610 --> 02:36:09.437]  They are a theocratic, sectarian, Islamic movement that want to control and destroy our secular way of life.
[02:36:12.290 --> 02:36:15.213]  Syrians do not agree with this.
[02:36:15.213 --> 02:36:18.435]  You can see that by the way that they're acting.
[02:36:18.435 --> 02:36:27.143]  I can tell you that, you know, the majority of Syrians went out and voted for our new constitution, which opens up
[02:36:29.852 --> 02:36:35.776]  The way for new political parties and for future elections.
[02:36:35.776 --> 02:36:40.899]  So the majority of people are for the reform process.
[02:36:40.899 --> 02:36:44.181]  The new constitution is already in place.
[02:36:44.181 --> 02:36:49.324]  You can split Syria up into three, I guess.
[02:36:49.324 --> 02:36:53.827]  There are people who support Bashar.
[02:36:53.827 --> 02:36:56.648]  They think that he is our savior.
[02:36:56.648 --> 02:36:57.469]  He's going to deliver us
[02:36:58.089 --> 02:37:08.455]  from this, that are, you know, have been core Ba'athists, which is the ideology of the party from the beginning.
[02:37:08.455 --> 02:37:17.460]  And there's people who are newly, you know, supporting Bashar because they want him to make the reform process happen.
[02:37:17.460 --> 02:37:25.365]  Then there's people who oppose the government because of corruption and things that have happened in the past.
[02:37:27.006 --> 02:37:32.228]  They're also not going to side with Israel, our enemies, nor NATO.
[02:37:32.228 --> 02:37:35.289]  And then, okay, this is four, not three, so maybe I can't count.
[02:37:35.289 --> 02:37:48.955]  But finally, there's a minority of people who have been sold the lie, just like the Iraqi collaborators were sold the lie that the U.S.
[02:37:48.955 --> 02:37:49.175]  is this
[02:37:49.395 --> 02:37:52.098]  Liberator, you know, it's fantastic.
[02:37:52.098 --> 02:37:53.920]  They're so humanitarian.
[02:37:53.920 --> 02:37:55.942]  They're going to come and save everybody.
[02:37:55.942 --> 02:38:05.952]  And, you know, this is the way to get power and the way to get freedom, whatever that means to them, is by allying with the US.
[02:38:05.952 --> 02:38:07.274]  Now, I think that is
[02:38:08.613 --> 02:38:17.502]  Such naivety and opportunism and it's just disgusting to the core and I cannot call these people Syrian.
[02:38:17.502 --> 02:38:30.756]  So if you want by my definition of what is Syrian, 100% of us oppose NATO and this attack against our country.
[02:38:31.550 --> 02:38:32.271]  Well, that's right.
[02:38:32.271 --> 02:38:42.060]  It's going to be... I mean, look, Iran, 70 plus percent don't like the mullahs, but every analyst says an attack on Iran will unify the entire population behind the mullahs.
[02:38:42.060 --> 02:38:43.401]  That's how people work.
[02:38:43.401 --> 02:38:49.847]  And now that your country is clearly being attacked with proxy armies, NATO saying we're going to drop bombs on you because it's humanitarian.
[02:38:50.327 --> 02:38:53.873]  You know, when we give weapons to people blowing up buildings, they're peaceful protesters.
[02:38:53.873 --> 02:38:56.677]  When the government fights it, they're evil.
[02:38:56.677 --> 02:38:57.779]  Al-Qaeda's good.
[02:38:57.779 --> 02:38:58.640]  Syria's bad.
[02:38:58.640 --> 02:39:03.367]  I mean, all of this is so ridiculous that it's going to unify Syria.
[02:39:03.367 --> 02:39:04.930]  I mean, I don't need to be Syrian to know that.
[02:39:07.159 --> 02:39:14.386]  I just wanted to say, in answer to your question earlier about how people might contact me, I have a Twitter.
[02:39:14.386 --> 02:39:16.728]  The name is Partisan Girl.
[02:39:16.728 --> 02:39:23.535]  And of course, they might have seen other interviews I've done on our YouTube channel, 108Morris108.
[02:39:23.535 --> 02:39:27.319]  Okay, and again, give us the Twitter, it's twitter.com forward slash...
[02:39:28.549 --> 02:39:29.810]  Partisan girl.
[02:39:29.810 --> 02:39:30.930]  No spaces.
[02:39:30.930 --> 02:39:32.311]  Partisan girl.
[02:39:32.311 --> 02:39:33.011]  That's awesome.
[02:39:33.011 --> 02:39:36.273]  And we'll send a link up to my Twitter, the Real Alex Jones.
[02:39:36.273 --> 02:39:38.334]  Twitter.com forward slash Real Alex Jones.
[02:39:38.334 --> 02:39:41.596]  So that's good for people to be able to contact you there.
[02:39:41.596 --> 02:39:46.898]  And hopefully things don't continue to unfold in Syria in a bad, but it looks like that is going to happen.
[02:39:46.898 --> 02:39:52.521]  So I'd like to be able to have you pop in and give your perspective as this unfolds.
[02:39:52.521 --> 02:39:53.662]  Anytime.
[02:39:53.662 --> 02:39:54.002]  All right.
[02:39:54.002 --> 02:39:55.743]  Anything else you'd like to add in about 60 seconds?
[02:39:57.632 --> 02:40:01.942]  Um, about Bashar, um, his father, you know,
[02:40:06.904 --> 02:40:12.209]  He might have been whatever you might want to call Wahhab.
[02:40:12.209 --> 02:40:18.315]  People have different opinions, but Bashar from the beginning has been more of a reformer.
[02:40:18.315 --> 02:40:29.526]  However, there's an old guard in Syria that have prevented him from undertaking much of the reforms that he wanted to make.
[02:40:30.668 --> 02:40:36.522]  At least now, with the support of the people, hopefully the reform process is going to happen.
[02:40:37.912 --> 02:40:39.133]  Thank you very much.
[02:41:03.669 --> 02:41:06.472]  Well, you're going to be hearing more from her now that she's been on our show.
[02:41:06.472 --> 02:41:14.800]  A very interesting perspective, and that's what we try to bring you is different angles, different perspectives to really give you a real analysis of what's happening so you can make decisions for yourself.
[02:41:14.800 --> 02:41:23.248]  Now, this is an hour and a half long, and it's up at PrisonPlanet.tv, but people have been asking for me to air part of the speech I did in Dallas and the one in Orlando.
[02:41:23.248 --> 02:41:25.010]  And again, as I told everybody,
[02:41:26.690 --> 02:41:27.211]  I don't know.
[02:41:43.723 --> 02:41:46.885]  Just amazing to see all the fellow freedom lovers.
[02:41:46.885 --> 02:41:51.869]  Of course, I thank everybody in this intro video, so I will not thank you now up front.
[02:41:51.869 --> 02:41:56.092]  So we're going to play about 10 minutes of this, go to break, come back and finish up the show with some more.
[02:41:56.092 --> 02:41:59.174]  But the whole thing is at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:41:59.174 --> 02:42:00.214]  And of course, we'll be back tonight.
[02:42:00.214 --> 02:42:03.797]  InfoWars Nightly News with a special transmission 7 o'clock Central.
[02:42:03.797 --> 02:42:08.080]  But here is part of the Dallas speech on February 19th.
[02:42:08.080 --> 02:42:08.420]  Here it is.
[02:42:12.142 --> 02:42:23.750]  I know the gentleman that you guys are here for, the Mario Andretti, the Rock, all rolled into one.
[02:42:23.750 --> 02:42:25.772]  It's time for Alex Jones!
[02:42:31.792 --> 02:42:34.994]  Now look at all these articles and documents and notes I've got.
[02:42:34.994 --> 02:42:37.636]  Hell, I've got to do a good job with all you great people out here.
[02:42:37.636 --> 02:42:44.601]  You know, like I said earlier when I introduced that documentary we just showed, I am humbled by meeting you.
[02:42:44.601 --> 02:42:46.562]  I'm humbled by talking to you.
[02:42:46.562 --> 02:42:49.564]  And I know that it's in people like you that we're going to turn this around.
[02:42:51.912 --> 02:42:54.774]  Because we don't have a choice.
[02:42:54.774 --> 02:42:57.296]  How many times have we been lied to?
[02:42:57.296 --> 02:43:12.068]  How many times have we caught the system doing everything it can, not just to rob us, but to try to ruin our lives so that we're weak and poor and dominated by them so they can control our destiny.
[02:43:12.068 --> 02:43:13.089]  I don't like that!
[02:43:13.089 --> 02:43:15.151]  I want to see humanity doing well!
[02:43:21.840 --> 02:43:24.461]  I want to see humanity empowered.
[02:43:24.461 --> 02:43:40.908]  You know my dad's a dentist and at least once a year for more than 20 years he's gone to Latin America to be part of these free clinics for these different doctors organizations to take care of kids and he told me the same stories that my uncle told me who did years of work as a missionary.
[02:43:41.508 --> 02:43:58.620]  In Central and South America, and he said, you know, you don't appreciate life, even though my uncle was in Vietnam, a helicopter pilot, until you see children at orphanages where the orphanages don't even have the money to pay for food, and there's little kids with their ribcages sticking out.
[02:43:59.500 --> 02:44:00.581]  That's what we're talking about.
[02:44:00.581 --> 02:44:17.502]  You have to realize, I have to realize, and really let it burn into our brains, that more than 15 million children, according to the UN, in their own numbers, it's probably higher, 15 million children a year starve to death on this planet.
[02:44:18.363 --> 02:44:21.368]  And another 20 million adults.
[02:44:21.368 --> 02:44:28.960]  And our corrupt, stinking, corporate, fascist government pays farmers not to produce food!
[02:44:33.041 --> 02:44:41.188]  And it's not just that they're trying to protect our markets, then you find out that they've got all these endless white papers, as many as you could ever read.
[02:44:41.188 --> 02:44:52.216]  Every day, Aaron Dyke's doing research, and others of my crew bring in, this is on the Rockefeller Foundation, this is on the Carnegie Foundation, this is on the Ford Foundation, here's a Planned Parenthood document, oh, where is it?
[02:44:52.216 --> 02:45:01.124]  It's on, you know, this university site archive, talking about how in the 30s, 40s, and 50s, we gotta shut food off to people to kill them!
[02:45:02.557 --> 02:45:05.279]  And then some people say, well, there are too many people.
[02:45:05.279 --> 02:45:07.300]  I love the yuppies.
[02:45:07.300 --> 02:45:13.344]  They'll say, well, okay, there is a population control agenda, but there are too many of those people.
[02:45:13.344 --> 02:45:17.667]  And I'm like, don't you get it, you little jackass bastard?
[02:45:17.667 --> 02:45:21.910]  You think you're part of the system?
[02:45:21.910 --> 02:45:28.414]  Your water, your food, your vaccines, it's all jacked with the same stuff, you little piece of crap!
[02:45:34.099 --> 02:45:42.124]  There is nothing more pathetic than some coward who is so cowardly they play like a little dress-up game in their mind.
[02:45:42.124 --> 02:45:44.525]  A little make-believe game in their mind.
[02:45:44.525 --> 02:45:49.008]  That they're part of the winning team because they go along with all this.
[02:45:49.008 --> 02:45:51.850]  That it's like some kind of open joke.
[02:45:51.850 --> 02:45:53.291]  Like it's some type of game.
[02:45:55.057 --> 02:46:13.203]  I've had so-called establishment types, it's always somebody who's worth like $50 million and thinks they're part of the elite when that ain't even middle class for the globalists, who'll come up to me and say, well Alex, you know, maybe 9-11 is an inside job, but you know it takes things like that to get the people doing what they're supposed to.
[02:46:13.203 --> 02:46:21.846]  Like this sack of garbage thinks they're part of the system because they can understand false flag terror and understand that's what it takes to defend America.
[02:46:23.426 --> 02:46:27.229]  If they did evil things like that to defeat evil, it'd be evil.
[02:46:27.229 --> 02:46:31.933]  Because you can't become evil to defeat evil like the ring of Sauron in Lord of the Rings.
[02:46:31.933 --> 02:46:33.474]  It doesn't work that way.
[02:46:33.474 --> 02:46:36.016]  But they're not using evil to defeat evil.
[02:46:36.016 --> 02:46:38.238]  They're not even following that fallacy.
[02:46:38.238 --> 02:46:41.641]  They have given themselves totally over to it.
[02:46:41.641 --> 02:46:47.505]  The globalists compete with each other to see who is the most wicked and ruthless.
[02:46:48.326 --> 02:46:56.391]  And in that process, have become total madmen as I documented in this earlier presentation that you saw.
[02:46:56.391 --> 02:46:58.753]  And that was only the tip of the iceberg.
[02:46:58.753 --> 02:47:09.279]  Our problem in compiling that 40 minutes was that there was so much we didn't get to, so much that we couldn't cover, so much that we couldn't show you how much crisis this world is in.
[02:47:09.279 --> 02:47:11.560]  Now with that said,
[02:47:12.887 --> 02:47:16.076]  I've given you the blueprint of madmen.
[02:47:16.076 --> 02:47:20.168]  I want to give you the blueprint to defeat the New World Order.
[02:47:29.346 --> 02:47:36.253]  This world's engineers, the controllers of this planet, always seek to teach you that resources are finite.
[02:47:36.253 --> 02:47:41.159]  They always seek to teach you that for you to win, somebody else has got to lose.
[02:47:41.159 --> 02:47:43.722]  They know full well that's not how this world works.
[02:47:43.722 --> 02:47:46.224]  That we have unlimited potential.
[02:47:46.224 --> 02:47:48.186]  That we're made in the image of the Creator.
[02:47:48.186 --> 02:47:51.290]  Whether you believe in that or not, humankind has given us Beethoven.
[02:47:51.610 --> 02:47:52.710]  Literature.
[02:47:52.710 --> 02:47:55.651]  They've given us all of the science, all of the beauty.
[02:47:55.651 --> 02:47:58.472]  They've given us people like Whitney Houston's voice.
[02:47:58.472 --> 02:48:00.413]  All the things that are in humanity.
[02:48:00.413 --> 02:48:01.553]  All the good.
[02:48:01.553 --> 02:48:09.796]  And it's by recognizing that good and that potential, and by reaching for what's good and empowers us, that we have hope for the future.
[02:48:10.436 --> 02:48:16.740]  Our ancestors, and God knows they weren't perfect, understood sacrifice and standing up for what's right.
[02:48:16.740 --> 02:48:19.802]  And that's the only reason we're here today.
[02:48:19.802 --> 02:48:26.207]  Why do you think the United States is such a small area geographically for the land surface of this planet?
[02:48:27.972 --> 02:48:32.316]  And only 4.5% of the world's population.
[02:48:32.316 --> 02:48:32.997]  100%.
[02:48:32.997 --> 02:48:34.618]  7 million.
[02:48:34.618 --> 02:48:39.682]  The United States is 4.5 or 4.9 depending on which actuary you look at.
[02:48:39.682 --> 02:48:43.366]  But less than 5% of the world's population.
[02:48:43.366 --> 02:48:50.132]  Why did the United States, with less than 5% of the world's population, have more than half the wealth of the world?
[02:48:51.949 --> 02:48:52.709]  Freedom.
[02:48:52.709 --> 02:48:56.611]  And it doesn't mean that our higher level of freedom was perfect.
[02:48:56.611 --> 02:48:58.892]  Doesn't mean that there wasn't injustice.
[02:48:58.892 --> 02:49:00.492]  Didn't mean that there weren't problems.
[02:49:00.492 --> 02:49:16.059]  But compared to every other place in the world, we didn't have the corrupt elites on top of us trying to shut down human destiny, shut down human ingenuity and creativity, because they're threatened by it, because they want a monopoly.
[02:49:16.059 --> 02:49:19.120]  Because the United States only had a few glimmers
[02:49:19.560 --> 02:49:23.702]  And moments of freedom, we developed the highest test scores.
[02:49:23.702 --> 02:49:26.224]  We developed the most scientific developments.
[02:49:26.224 --> 02:49:32.968]  We created the media and the literature and the art and the music that has conquered the world.
[02:49:32.968 --> 02:49:37.691]  And the globalists, the global scientific engineers saw that.
[02:49:37.691 --> 02:49:39.111]  They were aware of that.
[02:49:39.111 --> 02:49:40.552]  They knew that.
[02:49:40.552 --> 02:49:43.274]  And so they did everything they could to take that over.
[02:49:43.274 --> 02:49:46.256]  And to take our energies and turn it against humanity.
[02:49:46.256 --> 02:49:48.057]  So now America is in a paradox.
[02:49:48.997 --> 02:49:55.862]  America, right here at this center place where we live, make no mistake, is where the battle will be fought.
[02:49:55.862 --> 02:49:58.264]  It's where the decisions will be made.
[02:49:58.264 --> 02:50:03.347]  We are the great evil empire, but we are also the great deliverer from the tyranny.
[02:50:03.347 --> 02:50:05.709]  But we have to decide who we are!
[02:50:12.267 --> 02:50:17.430]  That's why the struggle between good and evil is being decided here.
[02:50:17.430 --> 02:50:20.152]  Because we have the birthright of liberty.
[02:50:20.152 --> 02:50:22.453]  Because we have the basic freedom.
[02:50:22.453 --> 02:50:27.276]  Because we are armed like no other nation on earth!
[02:50:27.276 --> 02:50:29.778]  The globalists have not taken this republic!
[02:50:29.778 --> 02:50:36.742]  Alright, I've never been able to do this on the radio.
[02:50:36.742 --> 02:50:40.925]  I can never get to the second point without going off into rants.
[02:50:42.150 --> 02:50:48.255]  It may be a bad speech, it may be the best ever, but I'm going to attempt, with your help, to go through all these points.
[02:51:01.547 --> 02:51:03.609]  Healthy soils grow healthy plants.
[02:51:03.609 --> 02:51:07.292]  So before you plant your survival garden this year, is your soil healthy?

[02:52:00.899 --> 02:52:09.567]  I've seen the Longevity products work for many others, and so I bought a bunch of them, started using them, had a little bit of results, but I wasn't following the regimen every day.
[02:52:09.567 --> 02:52:13.790]  But Aaron Dykes in my office did, and lost more than 60 pounds.
[02:52:13.790 --> 02:52:17.514]  When I saw those results, I said, I better follow my own advice.
[02:52:17.514 --> 02:52:20.997]  I started taking the Longevity products, and it's been incredible.
[02:52:20.997 --> 02:52:23.619]  37 pounds in two months.
[02:52:23.619 --> 02:52:26.862]  Our bodies are amazing, and God gave us an incredible gift.
[02:52:27.082 --> 02:52:35.968]  But if our body doesn't have the tools it needs, all of the vitamins, all of the minerals, and the other key essential trace elements, we're not going to be healthy.
[02:52:35.968 --> 02:52:37.149]  Folks, this isn't hype.
[02:52:37.149 --> 02:52:41.412]  I only bring to my listeners products that I've tried myself and I truly believe in.

[02:53:37.722 --> 02:53:39.544]  Waiting for the side effects disclaimers?
[02:53:39.544 --> 02:53:42.026]  With MDS Forte, there are none.

[02:54:11.562 --> 02:54:17.723]  And we are back on this InfoWars.com transmission with more from Alex's speech in Dallas, Texas.
[02:54:17.723 --> 02:54:22.104]  Of course, it's more than an hour and a half long, so you'll have to hear the majority of it for yourself.
[02:54:22.104 --> 02:54:25.565]  It's up at PrisonPlanet.tv and our YouTube channels.
[02:54:25.565 --> 02:54:30.126]  If you think this speech is powerful, wait till you hear the one he gave in Orlando.
[02:54:30.126 --> 02:54:39.908]  Enjoy, and we'll be back tomorrow.
[02:54:39.908 --> 02:54:40.968]  Alright, I'll start at the top.
[02:54:43.075 --> 02:54:50.843]  Again, I want to thank you all for being here.
[02:54:50.843 --> 02:54:53.786]  I want to thank my crew, but I also want to thank
[02:54:55.134 --> 02:54:55.794]  All of you!
[02:54:55.794 --> 02:54:58.436]  I love that Teddy Roosevelt quote.
[02:54:58.436 --> 02:55:03.518]  I should have had it here so I could quote it properly, but forget the critic, the person who's not in the arena.
[02:55:03.518 --> 02:55:08.181]  What matters is the person who is in the arena, who knows the great challenges, the great struggles.
[02:55:08.181 --> 02:55:11.562]  Because even if you fail, at least you tried to dare greatly.
[02:55:11.562 --> 02:55:12.783]  That's what matters.
[02:55:12.783 --> 02:55:13.963]  It's trying.
[02:55:13.963 --> 02:55:16.285]  That's where it all starts, is taking action.
[02:55:16.285 --> 02:55:20.947]  That's what's fulfilling.
[02:55:20.947 --> 02:55:22.728]  And I want to say this to you here now.
[02:55:24.753 --> 02:55:31.374]  Because I was told several times last week, and again today, that I am the 21st century Paul Revere.
[02:55:31.374 --> 02:55:33.315]  And I said, no.
[02:55:33.315 --> 02:55:41.756]  You are the 21st century Paul Revere!
[02:55:41.756 --> 02:55:44.597]  And this is not a battle.
[02:55:44.597 --> 02:55:50.558]  This is not a war against the undefeated British Imperial Redcoats, who'd never been defeated.
[02:55:51.721 --> 02:55:56.446]  George Washington lost almost every battle for five years, but they persevered.
[02:55:56.446 --> 02:55:58.609]  It was the continuing to fight.
[02:55:58.609 --> 02:56:00.491]  It was the resistance that was the victory.
[02:56:01.527 --> 02:56:03.648]  And that's why the system attacks that victory.
[02:56:03.648 --> 02:56:04.928]  Because it hates it.
[02:56:04.928 --> 02:56:09.110]  Anything the new world order attacks, you better believe that's where the liberty is.
[02:56:09.110 --> 02:56:09.930]  That's where the freedom is.
[02:56:09.930 --> 02:56:11.271]  That's what's good.
[02:56:11.271 --> 02:56:16.052]  Not because it's perfect, but like King David of the Bible, the heart is right.
[02:56:16.052 --> 02:56:17.253]  That's what matters.
[02:56:17.253 --> 02:56:18.773]  None of us are perfect.
[02:56:18.773 --> 02:56:22.555]  And the system will try to tell us how we're bad and how we're impure and how we're not good.
[02:56:23.135 --> 02:56:24.297]  None of that matters!
[02:56:24.297 --> 02:56:26.501]  It's our hearts that matter!
[02:56:26.501 --> 02:56:28.003]  It's what we stand for!
[02:56:28.003 --> 02:56:31.488]  It's who we are in the final equation that matters!
[02:56:33.134 --> 02:56:39.058]  Do we serve light, or do we serve the murdering, destructive darkness?
[02:56:39.058 --> 02:56:43.942]  That's the question that you must decide, and it's a decision you must make!
[02:56:43.942 --> 02:56:52.588]  The system tells you there's not that decision, because that decision is there, and that decision is where all the power in this universe resides.
[02:56:52.588 --> 02:56:57.031]  As Martin Luther King said, the universe bends towards justice.
[02:56:57.031 --> 02:56:59.173]  Providence is on the side of justice.
[02:57:03.018 --> 02:57:21.635]  The minute, the second you commit yourself to liberty and freedom and justice, even your body be killed, your spirit truly has victory!
[02:57:21.635 --> 02:57:23.197]  So I say it to you now.
[02:57:24.685 --> 02:57:28.230]  We are all Paul Revere.
[02:57:28.230 --> 02:57:31.334]  And we're not just fighting for freedom in North America.
[02:57:31.334 --> 02:57:32.276]  This is 1776 worldwide!
[02:57:40.868 --> 02:57:52.750]  Our Republic's wealth and everything it is and all of its challenges has now been teamed up, pulling the globalist system of enslavement and war and death.
[02:57:52.750 --> 02:57:56.031]  We are now in bondage to pure evil.
[02:57:56.031 --> 02:58:01.672]  Our energies and everything our ancestors built is now slave to this evil.
[02:58:01.672 --> 02:58:04.252]  And we must break the chains of slavery!
[02:58:04.252 --> 02:58:05.893]  We must break them now!
[02:58:05.893 --> 02:58:07.333]  We must declare liberty!
[02:58:16.530 --> 02:58:18.951]  Now those are just the notes up here on the top of the page.
[02:58:18.951 --> 02:58:26.714]  Because, I mean, I'm sitting here writing key points I want to cover and just thinking I'm not worthy to bring you this message.
[02:58:26.714 --> 02:58:28.215]  But it doesn't matter!
[02:58:28.215 --> 02:58:31.256]  Because it's a mission we must all carry out!
[02:58:31.256 --> 02:58:33.637]  And what matters is that we give 110%!
[02:58:33.637 --> 02:58:38.879]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
