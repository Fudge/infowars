[00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:08.489]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:10.669]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:12.650]  Alright, here I go.
[00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.673]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:22.574]  Are we seeing the earth?
[00:00:22.594 --> 00:00:25.295]  You got it.
[00:00:25.495 --> 00:00:29.117]  Are we seeing the earth now?
[00:00:29.237 --> 00:00:30.017]  You got it.
[00:00:31.073 --> 00:00:36.316]  It is Sunday, January 8th, 2012.
[00:00:36.516 --> 00:00:39.878]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours.
[00:00:40.018 --> 00:00:41.358]  I, of course, will be back tomorrow.
[00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:43.500]  Live on the radio, 11 a.m.
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.020]  to 2 p.m.
[00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.021]  Central, 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[00:00:46.101 --> 00:00:46.441]  Eastern.
[00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:52.624]  I cannot believe that
[00:00:55.552 --> 00:01:06.996]  The official statements that war with Iran is a foregone conclusion and basically imminent is not a bigger news item here in the United States.
[00:01:07.036 --> 00:01:12.078]  I guess we've been hearing about war for so long that you just begin to expect it.
[00:01:13.342 --> 00:01:27.169]  Kind of like you grow up your whole life hearing about how you die someday, and you watch grandparents die, you watch friends die, you watch neighbors die, you watch teachers die, you watch friends die, you watch a spouse die, you watch children die, and when it's time to die, you're like, well, this is just what happens.
[00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:36.554]  But this whole Iran situation is supposed to be the primer for the global crisis to really bring us into an official world government.
[00:01:37.478 --> 00:01:43.884]  It's unofficially been there, this corporate, global, anti-free market, anti-family tyranny for a very, very long time.
[00:01:43.924 --> 00:01:47.087]  But now, it's staring us right in the eyeballs.
[00:01:48.168 --> 00:01:49.510]  And it's not even mincing words.
[00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.535]  And you see the entire Bill of Rights and Constitution being shoved into a meat grinder.
[00:01:56.024 --> 00:01:59.046]  Or like a stick of celery, the last thing to go in is the First Amendment.
[00:01:59.547 --> 00:02:07.313]  And they're now shelling the idea that, yeah, we're going to start shutting off talk radio and people that question government, that means conspiracy theorists.
[00:02:08.053 --> 00:02:09.694]  All of this is going on.
[00:02:10.475 --> 00:02:11.936]  All of this is happening.
[00:02:12.156 --> 00:02:12.897]  And it's mind-blowing.
[00:02:14.761 --> 00:02:17.963]  Now I did watch the Republican ABC New Hampshire debate.
[00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:20.405]  We got that big primary coming up on Tuesday.
[00:02:20.425 --> 00:02:25.569]  Ron Paul is just turbocharging into second place everywhere.
[00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:28.371]  And I've got even the corporate horror media admitting that.
[00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:31.302]  We've got the demonization tactics against him.
[00:02:31.863 --> 00:02:33.705]  I've got some advice to the Paul campaign.
[00:02:34.887 --> 00:02:39.372]  But watching the debate last night, I know why so many people still get suckered.
[00:02:39.813 --> 00:02:44.299]  Because it is off who sounds the nicest, who sounds the best, who sounds the most reasonable.
[00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:46.141]  These are paid liars.
[00:02:47.282 --> 00:02:48.463]  All of them but Ron Paul.
[00:02:49.164 --> 00:02:51.065]  I'm not saying Mitt Romney's an evil person.
[00:02:51.846 --> 00:02:53.588]  I'm not saying Huntsman's an evil person.
[00:02:53.608 --> 00:02:56.050]  I am saying Newt Gingrich is evil.
[00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.912]  He's a globalist and a liar like I've never seen.
[00:02:59.493 --> 00:03:02.976]  But still, they're bought and paid for by the interest
[00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:05.000]  That control the Democrats.
[00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:06.481]  Just like Obama.
[00:03:06.541 --> 00:03:09.724]  I said, I don't think he's probably an evil person, but he's certainly a sellout.
[00:03:10.585 --> 00:03:13.047]  Bought and sold hundreds of times to get to where he is.
[00:03:13.427 --> 00:03:15.789]  And I knew what Obama would do from his advisors.
[00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:22.695]  I made the Obama deception that's even more popular three and a half years after he got into office than when I first made it.
[00:03:24.396 --> 00:03:27.419]  And the day he was elected, November 2008,
[00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.672]  And was seated January 22nd, 2009.
[00:03:32.833 --> 00:03:35.715]  I mean, I had that film almost done at his inauguration.
[00:03:35.795 --> 00:03:37.156]  I did the intro.
[00:03:37.416 --> 00:03:40.779]  I'd already done the rest of the film when he got inaugurated, so I had that intro shot.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.842]  And I laid out everything he'd do.
[00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:45.443]  He's going to invade Libya.
[00:03:45.784 --> 00:03:47.325]  They're going to attack this country.
[00:03:47.345 --> 00:03:49.587]  They're going to invade Africa through AFRICOM.
[00:03:50.167 --> 00:03:51.568]  They're going to call it peace.
[00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.131]  That's why he's being given the Peace Prize.
[00:03:55.932 --> 00:03:57.433]  They're going to pass the carbon taxes.
[00:03:57.554 --> 00:03:57.914]  All of it.
[00:03:58.917 --> 00:04:02.339]  And I keep going back to the Obama deception because it's the best work we've got.
[00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:13.624]  I can point at something over three years old and say that's the best piece of material out there to expose the whole left-right paradigm, the entire agenda.
[00:04:15.165 --> 00:04:20.368]  And obviously I've got a bunch of high-tech, globalist, Matrix-type news to go over.
[00:04:20.988 --> 00:04:23.349]  And then Jesse Ventura is going to be joining us.
[00:04:23.489 --> 00:04:24.470]  I taped the interview.
[00:04:25.854 --> 00:04:27.880]  Because it was going to be audio Skype from, uh...
[00:04:29.912 --> 00:04:32.154]  Basically, the desert coast of Baja.
[00:04:32.954 --> 00:04:35.216]  But, by the grace of God, it was good audio.
[00:04:35.896 --> 00:04:37.718]  So I wanted to tape it in case there were problems.
[00:04:37.738 --> 00:04:41.080]  We could edit out any problems, but it was all... It's gonna be unedited.
[00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.241]  It was a 35-minute interview.
[00:04:43.261 --> 00:04:48.205]  And people are like, well, why do you care so much if Jesse Ventura is being destroyed in the media?
[00:04:48.965 --> 00:04:50.226]  Because it's a PSYOP.
[00:04:50.927 --> 00:04:54.810]  And it signals they're going after anti-war activists right now.
[00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:55.770]  Andy's my friend.
[00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:57.311]  And yes, it's all a big lie.
[00:04:57.331 --> 00:04:57.952]  That's coming up.
[00:04:57.992 --> 00:04:58.432]  Stay with us.
[00:04:58.652 --> 00:04:59.273]  We'll break it down.
[00:05:00.356 --> 00:05:04.158]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are, a decade into the 21st century?
[00:05:04.478 --> 00:05:06.359]  Record foreclosure rates for homes.
[00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:08.240]  If not yours, your neighbor's.
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.121]  Thankful for the unemployment check since you were laid off.
[00:05:11.581 --> 00:05:18.084]  And placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:18.944]  We're good to go.
[00:05:38.131 --> 00:05:38.271]  You bet!
[00:06:04.386 --> 00:06:08.447]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:06:10.968 --> 00:06:15.190]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:22.512 --> 00:06:31.135]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:35.154 --> 00:06:39.057]  Well, this is going to be a doozy of a Sunday special report.
[00:06:40.037 --> 00:06:42.399]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:46.402]  Blasting out across the planet on the AM and FM dial.
[00:06:46.882 --> 00:06:50.004]  Number one when it comes to podcasts and audio streams on the internet.
[00:06:50.064 --> 00:06:51.085]  Number one radio show.
[00:06:51.385 --> 00:06:53.066]  We're into ShotKast and many other metrics.
[00:06:53.166 --> 00:06:54.367]  InfoWars.com.
[00:06:54.847 --> 00:06:59.490]  And of course the weekday show, 11 to 2 Central, during the day is also carried by XM.
[00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.172]  We've got to work on them picking up the Sunday.
[00:07:01.992 --> 00:07:05.654]  I know they pick it up live during the day and re-air it at night.
[00:07:05.674 --> 00:07:07.355]  In fact, that's an idea next week.
[00:07:07.375 --> 00:07:11.257]  We need to talk to the XM folks and get the show on Sunday.
[00:07:11.277 --> 00:07:16.460]  Okay, very important transmission lined up for you today.
[00:07:18.288 --> 00:07:25.732]  We obviously had a clip show with it being the beginning of the year last Sunday, but we are here.
[00:07:26.132 --> 00:07:28.273]  And I want to thank those of you out there for joining us.
[00:07:28.293 --> 00:07:40.299]  I know there's important things going on like NFL football, but because our world is being purposefully imploded into a global depression so that a handful of derivative-creating fraudster megabanks
[00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:44.762]  Can take over the planet via crony capitalism, the opposite of free market.
[00:07:45.242 --> 00:07:48.785]  A lot of you do realize that this information is absolutely vital.
[00:07:49.305 --> 00:07:50.786]  Let me say this out of the gates.
[00:07:52.267 --> 00:07:57.771]  We have Jesse Ventura joining us from his home in Baja, California.
[00:07:57.811 --> 00:07:59.532]  He's never done an interview from Mexico.
[00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:04.576]  He goes down there a few months off and on during the year to get out of the Minnesota winters.
[00:08:06.657 --> 00:08:08.280]  He joined us via audio Skype.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.943]  It's very good audio.
[00:08:10.484 --> 00:08:11.426]  I interviewed him before.
[00:08:11.446 --> 00:08:13.770]  We went live today in case there were any problems.
[00:08:15.071 --> 00:08:17.233]  Why is Jesse Ventura our top story?
[00:08:17.633 --> 00:08:21.957]  Not the collision course for war with Iran.
[00:08:22.137 --> 00:08:24.359]  Iran decides to close the Strait of Hormuz.
[00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:29.103]  They've oil exports blocked and they're now getting ready to cut off Iran's oil.
[00:08:29.844 --> 00:08:31.265]  That's happening in the EU right now.
[00:08:31.365 --> 00:08:35.448]  American, British, Israeli and Iranian warships sailing towards confrontation.
[00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:40.395]  IAEA prepared to react to any oil spill disruption.
[00:08:40.876 --> 00:08:42.778]  No steps planned now.
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.024]  Financial Times of London, Iran, Israel, US planned Gulf exercises.
[00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:49.007]  Iran said, of course, last Wednesday...
[00:08:50.185 --> 00:08:52.907]  There are official government publications that if any U.S.
[00:08:52.967 --> 00:09:00.092]  ships or Israeli or NATO enter the Strait of Hormuz, it will be their last warning, which is a threat for military attack.
[00:09:00.932 --> 00:09:06.216]  Not the best for Iran to be... I guess they realize it's a foregone conclusion they're going to be attacked.
[00:09:07.077 --> 00:09:09.738]  Israel vows to treat hackers like other terrorists.
[00:09:09.798 --> 00:09:11.299]  That's already happening here in the U.S.
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.241]  It is all coming up.
[00:09:14.261 --> 00:09:19.085]  And the reason the Ventura thing is going to be our top story... I'll get into the Iran more in the second hour today.
[00:09:21.323 --> 00:09:34.886]  Is because if we don't stand with somebody when they're under an artificial manufactured character assassination, like Ron Paul, myself, Jesse Ventura, or others, we're gonna hang separate.
[00:09:35.186 --> 00:09:41.707]  As founding father Benjamin Franklin said, we either hang together or hang separate, meaning from the end of a rope.
[00:09:43.568 --> 00:09:44.888]  And people are like, what are you talking about?
[00:09:46.613 --> 00:09:56.524]  And I'll get into some of the news before we get into this, when Jesse's son joins us first, filmmaker, director, TV host, Tyrel Venter, a great political mind in his own right.
[00:09:57.625 --> 00:10:01.309]  And then I'm going to air the interview with Jesse that I just did a few hours ago, about an hour and a half ago.
[00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:09.092]  And towards the end, there's parts of it, at the end, I'm not even going to air because it sounded like Jesse was just beside himself.
[00:10:10.313 --> 00:10:11.393]  I've never heard him like this.
[00:10:12.573 --> 00:10:16.075]  They're attempting to destroy Jesse Ventura because he is a loose cannon.
[00:10:16.615 --> 00:10:19.676]  And by loose cannon, wild card, he really says what he believes.
[00:10:19.716 --> 00:10:20.436]  He's a real guy.
[00:10:20.516 --> 00:10:22.417]  I've known him for about six, seven years now.
[00:10:22.737 --> 00:10:23.397]  He's a real guy.
[00:10:25.306 --> 00:10:39.281]  And MSNBC later admitted that they had hired him and paid him nine and a half million dollars so that they could basically not let him be anti-war during the Gulf War and hold him via contractually that he couldn't do any media interviews for three years.
[00:10:40.142 --> 00:10:46.569]  So from 2003 to 2006 you never heard him speak out because the system saw him as a major contender then.
[00:10:48.228 --> 00:10:49.548]  And they've done the focus groups.
[00:10:49.629 --> 00:10:53.090]  They know that anybody seen as anti-establishment is popular right now.
[00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:58.612]  That's why Ron Paul is so popular and number two or number one in all the major polls now.
[00:10:59.752 --> 00:11:11.116]  Even though he's older, even though he's scholarly but doesn't have a lot of thunder and lightning in him, he's very popular and the system's trying to destroy him.
[00:11:12.568 --> 00:11:23.216]  There's an ad tracked back to Huntsman operators, and this is all at Infowars.com, that came out Thursday that Fox News, CNN, and others ran, making fun of Asian people and implying it was a Ron Paul ad.
[00:11:24.056 --> 00:11:27.879]  And the media knows this and won't retract the fact that they blamed it on Ron Paul.
[00:11:28.619 --> 00:11:33.443]  They've hired people to dress up in hayseed outfits to say racist things to blame it on Rand Paul.
[00:11:34.984 --> 00:11:38.827]  There is no level of dirty trick that they won't engage in.
[00:11:38.847 --> 00:11:40.268]  And so it's not just about Jesse Ventura.
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.882]  It's about how they can destroy people.
[00:11:45.443 --> 00:11:46.704]  And I've experienced this.
[00:11:46.784 --> 00:11:50.346]  I was protesting Obama and covering it at the DNC 2008.
[00:11:50.847 --> 00:11:56.791]  And Michelle Malcolm was there and she'd accused me of lying about the Marines throwing a puppy off a cliff.
[00:11:56.831 --> 00:11:59.793]  And she said it was a robot puppy and it was probably staged.
[00:12:00.313 --> 00:12:02.475]  And of course the Marines had already admitted it was a real event.
[00:12:03.069 --> 00:12:05.871]  And I walked up to her and I said, how dare you say I was a liar?
[00:12:06.231 --> 00:12:07.512]  That's admitting to be a real puppy.
[00:12:07.792 --> 00:12:09.873]  Now admit you were wrong.
[00:12:10.393 --> 00:12:12.955]  And the people that were with her started getting in my face and bumping into me.
[00:12:12.975 --> 00:12:14.796]  So I shoved one of them back.
[00:12:15.156 --> 00:12:16.117]  They almost fell over.
[00:12:16.157 --> 00:12:16.677]  I couldn't believe it.
[00:12:16.697 --> 00:12:17.738]  Two of them almost fell over.
[00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:18.638]  Barely shoved them.
[00:12:18.658 --> 00:12:20.139]  It was like they were dominoes or something.
[00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:26.063]  And then they brought in these other guys I later learned had left with them, who stood behind me and were wearing masks and hats.
[00:12:26.423 --> 00:12:27.223]  It's all online.
[00:12:27.483 --> 00:12:29.705]  Screaming, kill Michelle Malkin, kill Michelle Malkin.
[00:12:30.285 --> 00:12:34.790]  And within an hour of this happening, I had national TV calling me saying, why'd you say killer?
[00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:37.093]  And Denver Post and Dallas Morning News.
[00:12:37.413 --> 00:12:40.056]  And I knew right then they'd move so fast, it was a psy-op.
[00:12:40.396 --> 00:12:45.342]  So I got back to the hotel, reviewed our footage, and had them on tape screaming, kill Michelle Malkin.
[00:12:45.582 --> 00:12:47.264]  And I had the footage showing they left with her.
[00:12:47.544 --> 00:12:50.247]  So I got that up quickly, stayed up late, got it on YouTube.
[00:12:50.948 --> 00:12:56.731]  By the time I went on Coast to Coast AM, because they asked me on to answer for this, because they'd seen the national news, and I'd say, kill her.
[00:12:57.451 --> 00:12:59.052]  Kill a defenseless woman.
[00:12:59.412 --> 00:13:01.553]  And I was able to say, here's the video.
[00:13:01.593 --> 00:13:02.494]  And everybody watched it.
[00:13:02.794 --> 00:13:05.495]  It got half a million hits or whatever, views.
[00:13:05.515 --> 00:13:07.116]  People said, wow, they set him up.
[00:13:07.516 --> 00:13:09.857]  I forced retractions in newspapers across the country.
[00:13:10.457 --> 00:13:12.118]  I threatened to sue the Dallas Morning News.
[00:13:12.378 --> 00:13:13.399]  They would not retract.
[00:13:14.178 --> 00:13:18.060]  But they were so discredited, I said, fine, I don't have time to sue you.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.082]  Because obviously the tide turned and it backfired on them.
[00:13:23.763 --> 00:13:29.887]  We Are Change, an activist group that I basically inspired and helped set up all across the country to fight the globalists.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:41.583]  They were protesting Laura Bush and suddenly a man jumped out of a dark alley by the Barnes and Noble, started ramming his daughter into the reporters with her in a wheelchair saying, don't attack my daughter.
[00:13:42.103 --> 00:13:43.063]  It was all in the news.
[00:13:43.083 --> 00:13:45.043]  9-11 truthers attack girl in wheelchair.
[00:13:45.364 --> 00:13:46.484]  They went all the way to trial.
[00:13:46.524 --> 00:13:47.984]  The Secret Service got on stand.
[00:13:48.504 --> 00:13:50.065]  NYPD lied and said they attacked.
[00:13:50.085 --> 00:13:55.106]  The Secret Service would not lie and said, nope, that man with his daughter in a wheelchair came out of nowhere and rammed him.
[00:13:56.164 --> 00:13:59.365]  And we even had video of the guy screaming, don't do it.
[00:14:00.326 --> 00:14:01.366]  Please, why are you attacking me?
[00:14:01.406 --> 00:14:02.687]  But it didn't matter.
[00:14:02.727 --> 00:14:05.408]  The media, the New York Post, Rupert Murdoch ran with it.
[00:14:06.609 --> 00:14:08.770]  And so we've seen this over and over again.
[00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:13.092]  And they had to retract, though, in the New York Post when they were found not guilty in court.
[00:14:13.432 --> 00:14:16.693]  And the Secret Service agent did their duty and did not lie.
[00:14:17.153 --> 00:14:20.275]  NYPD absolutely disgraced themselves.
[00:14:21.575 --> 00:14:22.976]  Absolutely disgraced themselves.
[00:14:25.177 --> 00:14:27.578]  And so they could do this any time.
[00:14:27.999 --> 00:14:30.640]  They could pull me over and claim I'm on PCP.
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:34.162]  They could pull me over and do anything.
[00:14:35.102 --> 00:14:36.983]  And I've been threatened with all sorts of stuff.
[00:14:37.063 --> 00:14:39.984]  They could beat me up in the parking lot, that's happened before.
[00:14:40.104 --> 00:14:45.747]  So just understand folks, those of us that are right out at the tip of the spear are under attack.
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:51.763]  And Jesse out of the blue said, I just want to say that me and my wife will never commit suicide either.
[00:14:51.803 --> 00:14:54.926]  He's going to have to drive back up in his RV from Baja, Mexico.
[00:14:54.946 --> 00:15:02.212]  And he, you know, off the record, you know, they're going to take, they said, don't say we're going to off the record, but then Jesse said it on air with me.
[00:15:02.452 --> 00:15:03.113]  We haven't aired it yet.
[00:15:03.973 --> 00:15:05.755]  You know, he said, he's already got the wheels rolling.
[00:15:05.775 --> 00:15:06.696]  He's going after all of them.
[00:15:06.736 --> 00:15:10.279]  He has to, because if you're a new listener or you didn't see,
[00:15:12.183 --> 00:15:26.955]  Ten times I know of, or more, on Fox News, they had this quote, most deadly sniper on, who's got a book out, to say that he beat up Jesse Ventura, because Jesse said he's glad troops are dying.
[00:15:28.797 --> 00:15:34.301]  And then, and of course, there's no witnesses, no nothing, and it just totally is incredible, meant to assassinate his character.
[00:15:34.721 --> 00:15:39.125]  So I hope Chris Kyle, this Navy SEAL guy, enjoys this, because Ventura is 110% coming after him.
[00:15:40.928 --> 00:15:43.490]  And he beat Vince McMahon in lawsuits and many others.
[00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:46.713]  I mean, he's not litigious, you know, but, I mean, you just better look out.
[00:15:47.573 --> 00:15:56.921]  So, that's all coming up, but they're wanting to assassinate his character now because they know, they've been tapping his phones, obviously.
[00:15:56.941 --> 00:15:59.123]  I know what he was planning to do politically.
[00:15:59.163 --> 00:16:00.724]  They want to destroy him before he runs for president.
[00:16:02.352 --> 00:16:03.854]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:16:04.074 --> 00:16:09.099]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:16:09.379 --> 00:16:10.740]  Saving means to make money.
[00:16:10.921 --> 00:16:19.709]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:27.534]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:16:27.974 --> 00:16:35.578]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:16:35.959 --> 00:16:40.881]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:16:41.201 --> 00:16:43.363]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[00:17:01.035 --> 00:17:02.296]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:17:02.356 --> 00:17:07.698]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:17:07.938 --> 00:17:12.560]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:13.340]  It's true.
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:17.982]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:17:18.522 --> 00:17:23.225]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:17:23.746 --> 00:17:25.687]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:17:26.047 --> 00:17:30.670]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:31.771]  And here's the best part.
[00:17:31.971 --> 00:17:34.753]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:17:35.053 --> 00:17:38.355]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[00:17:51.603 --> 00:17:57.384]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:17:57.704 --> 00:18:00.164]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:18:01.604 --> 00:18:16.047]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:18:17.065 --> 00:18:20.786]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.

[00:20:09.383 --> 00:20:18.249]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:20:19.209 --> 00:20:22.011]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:24.893 --> 00:20:31.477]  Alright, so I'll get into the defamation and the political destruction, the attempt of it, of Jesse Ventura.
[00:20:34.605 --> 00:20:36.066]  We're good to go.
[00:21:00.043 --> 00:21:02.545]  Well, you know what's on something that happens in the courts.
[00:21:03.186 --> 00:21:04.447]  So just enjoy yourselves.
[00:21:04.988 --> 00:21:11.434]  But again, this is the anatomy of a hit piece of a system desperate to destroy people.
[00:21:12.375 --> 00:21:13.977]  So Jesse Ventura coming up.
[00:21:13.997 --> 00:21:18.761]  And then after that, we'll open the phones up and get into some of the other news.
[00:21:18.781 --> 00:21:21.023]  But let me get into the top stories right now.
[00:21:23.684 --> 00:21:27.626]  Iran decides to close the Strait of Hormuz if oil exports blocked.
[00:21:27.666 --> 00:21:35.610]  It's an InfoWars.com article linking to three different official publications of the Iranian government.
[00:21:37.128 --> 00:21:51.235]  The senior commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard told the National Daily on Sunday that the Iranian government has decided to close the strategic Strait of Hormuz at the mouth of the Persian Gulf if the country's oil exports are blocked.
[00:21:51.795 --> 00:21:53.896]  And the EU is set to block it.
[00:21:54.216 --> 00:21:55.957]  51% of all of their gasoline is imported.
[00:21:55.977 --> 00:21:58.318]  They don't have enough refineries for their oil.
[00:21:58.798 --> 00:22:02.540]  Also on Sunday, Iranian Army Commander Brigadier General
[00:22:04.113 --> 00:22:04.914]  I don't know.
[00:22:22.082 --> 00:22:22.262]  I think?
[00:22:43.519 --> 00:22:52.302]  That makes the laws, declares war, and then you're handed that declaration of war and directed against the enemy in the declaration.
[00:22:53.242 --> 00:22:56.183]  See, people think the president is the boss.
[00:22:57.023 --> 00:22:58.163]  Not in a republic.
[00:22:58.823 --> 00:23:00.664]  They don't trust a president to make war.
[00:23:00.724 --> 00:23:01.544]  The founders didn't.
[00:23:01.884 --> 00:23:03.565]  George Washington, Thomas Jefferson.
[00:23:03.765 --> 00:23:05.005]  Because they can become a dictator.
[00:23:05.325 --> 00:23:09.667]  Caesar used that power to become dictator in Rome 2,060-something years ago.
[00:23:09.967 --> 00:23:10.427]  Look it up.
[00:23:11.047 --> 00:23:26.255]  The Congress that represents the states, 500 plus people, they debate, they vote, they make the decision, then they write up the Declaration of War, who it is, what the goal is, and they say, you are now the Commander-in-Chief.
[00:23:26.555 --> 00:23:28.276]  That hat only goes on.
[00:23:29.376 --> 00:23:31.878]  And they always say, the Commander-in-Chief, and play music and do this.
[00:23:32.138 --> 00:23:35.860]  They didn't even do that until the 70s.
[00:23:37.776 --> 00:23:39.177]  They didn't call them Commander-in-Chief.
[00:23:39.197 --> 00:23:40.779]  They didn't wear jackets saying that.
[00:23:41.219 --> 00:23:45.843]  They are the Commander-in-Chief when Congress delivers them the law of war.
[00:23:46.664 --> 00:23:47.965]  Here is the declaration.
[00:23:48.025 --> 00:23:48.846]  Here is the enemy.
[00:23:49.547 --> 00:23:51.088]  You are to execute this.
[00:23:51.288 --> 00:23:52.530]  You are now the top general.
[00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:53.570]  Execute!
[00:23:54.651 --> 00:23:55.232]  Execute it!
[00:23:55.252 --> 00:23:57.234]  It's like a warrant to a police officer.
[00:23:57.494 --> 00:23:59.336]  Can a police officer come in your house without a warrant?
[00:24:00.345 --> 00:24:00.945]  No, they can't.
[00:24:01.005 --> 00:24:09.851]  Unless they see criminals with bags of money, you know, running out the front door, the cop chases them, they run back in, that's probable cause right there.
[00:24:09.871 --> 00:24:13.134]  A citizen can do that under common law.
[00:24:13.374 --> 00:24:14.575]  That's what citizen's arrest is.
[00:24:15.535 --> 00:24:17.356]  You see somebody shooting people in the street?
[00:24:17.376 --> 00:24:18.257]  You can go out and shoot them.
[00:24:18.777 --> 00:24:21.980]  You see the tower sniper in UT shooting people?
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:23.741]  You can go up and fire back at him.
[00:24:24.758 --> 00:24:32.648]  The system wants to get rid of common law and bring in this system where only specialized government minions can do it to usurp the rightful power of the people.
[00:24:32.688 --> 00:24:33.509]  But I'm digressing.
[00:24:35.011 --> 00:24:38.716]  Now before, by the 60s, they stopped declaring war.
[00:24:40.325 --> 00:24:41.386]  Not by Vietnam, completely.
[00:24:42.186 --> 00:24:43.267]  Even Korea, they didn't declare war.
[00:24:43.287 --> 00:24:46.309]  They called it a police action, but it was a big fight in Congress over it.
[00:24:46.609 --> 00:24:54.234]  So Congress still authorized the police action for the President, but didn't call it war, because of all the things that entailed.
[00:24:54.815 --> 00:24:58.417]  By Vietnam, they staged the Gulf of Tonkin attack, nothing is said.
[00:24:58.817 --> 00:25:05.222]  They just do it, but they still have the Gulf of Tonkin resolution that Congress, the President calls for, Congress passes.
[00:25:06.222 --> 00:25:12.407]  So to get us away from declarations of war, they still have Congress issue the order, but they call it something else.
[00:25:12.487 --> 00:25:14.508]  The lawyers are slowly abridging it.
[00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:27.618]  Right through the Gulf War, before that, Panama in 87, all of these events, or 88, all of these events, Congress gives the approval.
[00:25:28.478 --> 00:25:33.162]  Gulf War I, Gulf War II, Afghanistan, Congress, Congress, Congress.
[00:25:35.865 --> 00:25:37.005]  But not under Obama.
[00:25:37.645 --> 00:25:41.186]  Obama violates Article 1, Section 9, becomes the head of the U.N.
[00:25:41.206 --> 00:25:41.986]  Security Council.
[00:25:42.866 --> 00:25:51.408]  That's why they had all these globalist bureaucrats there, like Henry Kissinger, weeping on C-SPAN when Obama sat as the head of the U.N.
[00:25:51.428 --> 00:25:52.048]  Security Council.
[00:25:52.068 --> 00:25:52.808]  It was high treason.
[00:25:53.468 --> 00:25:56.949]  I mean, it was an American president serving as the head of the U.N.
[00:25:56.969 --> 00:25:58.629]  Security Council, the real head of the U.N.
[00:25:58.969 --> 00:26:02.090]  I mean, it was wearing two hats, serving a foreign power.
[00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:03.050]  Unbelievable.
[00:26:04.229 --> 00:26:04.989]  He didn't stop there.
[00:26:05.009 --> 00:26:08.370]  Now Obama has all these recess appointments, and they're talking about impeachment.
[00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:09.410]  That was in the news Friday.
[00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:13.491]  Because the Senate has never even heard these.
[00:26:14.131 --> 00:26:19.632]  You're supposed to take almost a year without the Senate hearing them before it's a recess appointment, and then they still have to be heard later.
[00:26:19.892 --> 00:26:28.274]  He's saying, no, they're permanently federal court heads, federal judges, at high-level positions at the major courts of appeals.
[00:26:31.178 --> 00:26:31.919]  Other major courts.
[00:27:02.178 --> 00:27:03.139]  Second hour, we have time.
[00:27:03.179 --> 00:27:05.399]  I'll get to these again, because there's a bunch of them.
[00:27:05.419 --> 00:27:11.882]  I didn't get to all of them on Friday, where he's in all these dozens of speeches saying, Congress is the problem, and I'm going to do this without them now.
[00:27:15.183 --> 00:27:19.924]  He says they're the problem, and the crowds cheer.
[00:27:20.404 --> 00:27:23.786]  The president operating on his own, which is what the bureaucracy wants.
[00:27:23.826 --> 00:27:25.226]  They want to get rid of Congress.
[00:27:25.426 --> 00:27:27.707]  They want to make it basically ceremonial, a rubber stamp.
[00:27:29.201 --> 00:27:33.763]  So he's launching wars and saying they're kinetic actions, and he's doing it for the UN and for their credibility.
[00:27:34.784 --> 00:27:37.485]  He's got the EPA shutting down power plants.
[00:27:37.525 --> 00:27:38.666]  You notice your power bill going up.
[00:27:39.086 --> 00:27:42.148]  All over the country, coal-powered plants and others, including dams.
[00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:51.474]  So that insiders that have paid him all these contributions like GE, they can generate more power now and charge more because their competition got shut down.
[00:27:51.974 --> 00:27:53.675]  They all get waivers, just like on health care.
[00:27:54.155 --> 00:27:58.638]  All the big unions, McDonald's, all the big insider, Fortune 100, they get waivers.
[00:27:59.118 --> 00:28:00.158]  You don't get a waiver.
[00:28:01.739 --> 00:28:04.781]  This is what fascism, crony capitalism is.
[00:28:05.881 --> 00:28:10.864]  But they socialize your wealth to make you dependent, but then they transfer it to the fascist level above that.
[00:28:12.256 --> 00:28:15.779]  All the time, you never hear a Republican talk show host tell you about this.
[00:28:15.819 --> 00:28:18.281]  They say all corporations are great, Wall Street's wonderful.
[00:28:18.522 --> 00:28:20.663]  Really, with all their tens of trillions in bank or bailout?
[00:28:21.604 --> 00:28:22.365]  Of taxpayer money?
[00:28:22.385 --> 00:28:23.486]  You call that free market?
[00:28:23.706 --> 00:28:26.989]  That's a bunch of welfare pimps signing us onto their Ponzi schemes.
[00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:29.091]  Democrats won't tell you that.
[00:28:29.331 --> 00:28:30.472]  Republicans won't tell you that.
[00:28:30.772 --> 00:28:32.374]  Only one that'll talk about it is Ron Paul.
[00:28:35.233 --> 00:28:43.596]  So they're shutting down our energy, they're launching wars, they're passing laws saying the military can secretly arrest Americans, NDAA, torture us, disappear us.
[00:28:44.797 --> 00:28:46.517]  They're gearing up for war with Iran.
[00:28:46.537 --> 00:28:50.559]  That'll be a great political diversion for them while they rob us and devalue the dollar.
[00:28:51.639 --> 00:28:54.920]  They're violating the Constitution from one end to another.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:59.222]  But we're going to look at the anatomy of a hit piece straight ahead.
[00:29:01.704 --> 00:29:07.187]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:29:08.368 --> 00:29:13.131]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing Diamond Gussets.
[00:29:13.511 --> 00:29:20.296]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:29:22.237 --> 00:29:24.738]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:29:26.299 --> 00:29:28.260]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:29:30.718 --> 00:29:34.620]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:29:35.321 --> 00:29:38.442]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[00:29:39.163 --> 00:29:39.943]  Others don't.
[00:29:40.384 --> 00:29:42.265]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:29:42.525 --> 00:29:44.026]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[00:29:44.306 --> 00:29:46.867]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:29:47.207 --> 00:29:53.451]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:29:53.831 --> 00:29:56.053]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:29:56.533 --> 00:29:58.554]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[00:29:58.894 --> 00:29:59.755]  Others don't.
[00:30:05.137 --> 00:30:06.058]  Tyranny is here.
[00:30:06.398 --> 00:30:09.981]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:30:10.281 --> 00:30:12.543]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:30:12.563 --> 00:30:18.007]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:30:18.447 --> 00:30:24.692]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:30:25.092 --> 00:30:30.655]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:30:31.075 --> 00:30:34.737]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:30:35.257 --> 00:30:39.219]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:45.042]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:30:45.483 --> 00:30:48.464]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:30:49.045 --> 00:30:50.485]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:30:51.006 --> 00:30:51.446]  It's here.

[00:32:11.883 --> 00:32:18.392]  And placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.

[00:32:27.314 --> 00:32:28.594]  Your greatest dependency.

[00:33:05.789 --> 00:33:09.092]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:33:09.112 --> 00:33:13.657]  Look at the shoes you're filling.
[00:33:14.798 --> 00:33:17.180]  Look at the blood we're spilling.
[00:33:18.381 --> 00:33:20.744]  Look at the world we're killing.
[00:33:21.945 --> 00:33:24.868]  The way we've always done before.
[00:33:27.662 --> 00:33:37.432]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, and coming up I'm going to air an interview I did a few hours ago with Jesse Ventura from Mexico, joining us via Skype.
[00:33:37.652 --> 00:33:42.937]  But now I have his son, filmmaker in his own right, TV host in his own right, Tyrell Ventura.
[00:33:42.957 --> 00:33:46.921]  Before we go to Tyrell, I want to just introduce why we're covering this.
[00:33:48.473 --> 00:33:53.756]  In a week where the Iranians are standing by saying they'll attack U.S.
[00:33:53.816 --> 00:33:57.058]  and Israeli ships that enter the Strait of Hormuz, and U.S.
[00:33:57.078 --> 00:34:12.048]  and Israeli ships are preparing to enter it in the next four days, in a week when the EU is putting sanctions on Iran to shut down all gasoline being imported in, which Iran says is an act of war, I'm not taking sides, folks, but it is,
[00:34:12.748 --> 00:34:14.368]  Do you have any idea what this is going to do to the economy?
[00:34:14.448 --> 00:34:17.849]  An industrial depression within days of this happening.
[00:34:18.349 --> 00:34:20.549]  This could kick off a giant regional war.
[00:34:20.669 --> 00:34:22.810]  It's what the globalists want as a distraction.
[00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:25.770]  I'm not saying Iran's without problems.
[00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:30.791]  The point is, the politicians who are universally hated now need this as a distraction.
[00:34:31.131 --> 00:34:33.352]  With all of this happening, we're covering it next hour.
[00:34:35.252 --> 00:34:40.573]  What did Fox News and other TV networks cover Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and today?
[00:34:41.843 --> 00:34:52.910]  More than 10 shows that I've seen on Fox, O'Reilly Factor, you name it, led their shows with a, quote, Navy SEAL sniper from the Turkey shoot at Fallujah.
[00:34:54.331 --> 00:35:06.139]  Chris Kyle with a book out, notice the publishers didn't want this in the book, to promote his book saying he was at a Navy SEAL bar, by the way Jesse hadn't drunk in decades and I know him well, hung out with him a lot, doesn't drink.
[00:35:07.219 --> 00:35:12.403]  And that Jesse Ventura was there at a wake saying, I'm glad the Navy SEALs are basically dying.
[00:35:12.804 --> 00:35:13.964]  Which is just asinine.
[00:35:14.365 --> 00:35:17.267]  And then the guy punches him, knocks him down and runs away.
[00:35:19.149 --> 00:35:21.190]  And I watched it and it didn't come off very credible.
[00:35:22.491 --> 00:35:29.197]  All over TV, with Fox News running headlines, Navy SEAL sniper punches out Jesse Ventura, never saying he alleges.
[00:35:32.881 --> 00:35:39.925]  Now, two weeks ago, TMZ, that is an affiliate of Fox, works with him, put out a story that he was in California, pulled over by cops, road-raging.
[00:35:40.406 --> 00:35:43.688]  I talked to Jesse the day before, setting him up for a week later on the show.
[00:35:43.708 --> 00:35:45.569]  We're friends, we talk all the time about stuff that's happening.
[00:35:46.209 --> 00:35:49.211]  He ended up calling the show the next day before I'd even heard of it, saying, I'm here in Minnesota.
[00:35:49.852 --> 00:35:51.433]  They just said I'm road-raging out here.
[00:35:51.633 --> 00:35:55.756]  He said, I think this is a hit piece, because he's been considering running as Libertarian for President.
[00:35:56.596 --> 00:35:59.279]  There's been some other talk about Ron Paul picking him as a VP.
[00:35:59.319 --> 00:36:03.964]  The point is, they want to destroy Ventura because they know he's a wild card.
[00:36:04.565 --> 00:36:12.413]  I want to play a minute or two of this, then go to Tyrell Ventura to get his take on this, and then go to the interview with Jesse Ventura, former Minnesota governor.
[00:36:12.433 --> 00:36:13.314]  But here is
[00:36:14.275 --> 00:36:17.320]  The guy promoting this book, but guaranteed, he's a mercenary.
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:19.302]  He's hooked in with Dick Cheney, Richard Perle.
[00:36:19.342 --> 00:36:22.187]  He trains police now to deal with domestic extremists.
[00:36:22.507 --> 00:36:24.530]  This is his coming out, his rollout.
[00:36:25.051 --> 00:36:27.695]  And I guess they want to assassinate the credibility of Ventura.
[00:36:29.031 --> 00:36:31.173]  Here's a clip of him on a O'Reilly Thursday night.
[00:36:31.193 --> 00:36:32.114]  I think they'll like it.
[00:36:32.214 --> 00:36:38.479]  First of all, you say you knocked Jesse Ventura to the floor with a punch.
[00:36:38.819 --> 00:36:41.502]  Now, you don't mention his name, but everybody knows who that is.
[00:36:42.062 --> 00:36:43.203]  Number one, that happened?
[00:36:43.243 --> 00:36:43.864]  You knocked him out?
[00:36:44.084 --> 00:36:45.805]  Well, I knocked him down.
[00:36:45.945 --> 00:36:46.546]  Knocked him down.
[00:36:47.167 --> 00:36:47.487]  Why?
[00:36:47.567 --> 00:36:48.868]  Why would you punch Ventura?
[00:36:49.368 --> 00:36:54.052]  It was in 06, was the year that we lost our first two sales in Iraq.
[00:36:54.813 --> 00:36:55.474]  We came home.
[00:36:55.534 --> 00:36:58.278]  We lost our last guy just before coming home.
[00:36:58.959 --> 00:37:04.107]  We had the wake in a seal bar there in Coronado, and he was there.
[00:37:04.407 --> 00:37:09.655]  He was there for a speaking engagement at a bud ceremony, graduating class.
[00:37:09.955 --> 00:37:11.456]  Because he was a SEAL, right?
[00:37:11.476 --> 00:37:13.278]  He was a Navy SEAL.
[00:37:13.678 --> 00:37:15.559]  So he was bad mouth in the war, right?
[00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:19.202]  Bad mouth in the war, bad mouth in Bush, bad mouth in America.
[00:37:19.802 --> 00:37:20.823]  And you took exception?
[00:37:21.584 --> 00:37:23.905]  I did find a problem with it.
[00:37:24.006 --> 00:37:25.146]  The family was there.
[00:37:25.727 --> 00:37:30.851]  I asked him to please tone it down, that we did not want to upset the family members of Mikey Monsoor.
[00:37:31.431 --> 00:37:31.992]  Who was killed?
[00:37:32.252 --> 00:37:32.672]  Yes, sir.
[00:37:32.732 --> 00:37:34.114]  And he earned the Medal of Honor.
[00:37:34.154 --> 00:37:36.796]  He jumped on a grenade and saved everybody else around.
[00:37:36.936 --> 00:37:37.717]  But I want to be clear.
[00:37:37.777 --> 00:37:41.240]  Ventura wasn't attacking him at all, verbally bashing him.
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:43.282]  He was just bashing the whole thing in general.
[00:37:43.542 --> 00:37:43.922]  Yes, sir.
[00:37:44.042 --> 00:37:46.705]  Until he said, we deserve to lose a few guys.
[00:37:47.145 --> 00:37:53.071]  He said, we deserve to... we, the United States... No, he said, you, y'all, deserve to lose a few guys.
[00:37:53.231 --> 00:37:53.891]  Navy SEALs.
[00:37:54.532 --> 00:37:56.714]  I'm assuming he was saying that to me.
[00:37:57.034 --> 00:37:57.555]  Was he drunk?
[00:37:58.268 --> 00:37:58.588]  No, sir.
[00:37:58.728 --> 00:38:00.648]  I never saw him with a drink in hand.
[00:38:00.688 --> 00:38:01.949]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[00:38:01.969 --> 00:38:04.289]  And I'll have to hold Tyrell over.
[00:38:04.349 --> 00:38:05.809]  And the whole Ventura interview is coming up.
[00:38:05.849 --> 00:38:07.790]  Just taped two hours ago or so.
[00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:11.830]  Ladies and gentlemen, notice the psychological warfare.
[00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:12.791]  It's the same in every interview.
[00:38:12.851 --> 00:38:13.371]  It's scripted.
[00:38:13.971 --> 00:38:15.831]  This guy's following a well-trained script.
[00:38:17.791 --> 00:38:18.712]  He hates Bush.
[00:38:18.992 --> 00:38:19.912]  He hates the war.
[00:38:19.992 --> 00:38:21.112]  He hates America.
[00:38:22.032 --> 00:38:22.792]  Notice these terms.
[00:38:22.812 --> 00:38:25.053]  Like, if you don't like wars, you hate America.
[00:38:25.233 --> 00:38:26.753]  This is ahead of an attack on Iran.
[00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:31.716]  They're wanting to go after people who they know could speak out against it.
[00:38:33.399 --> 00:38:36.244]  And you notice he makes it about a family, awake.
[00:38:36.384 --> 00:38:38.708]  Ventura's there saying, you deserve to die.
[00:38:38.768 --> 00:38:41.533]  I mean, you couldn't write a script of something more ridiculous.
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:45.801]  And it is just off the charts.
[00:38:45.821 --> 00:38:46.962]  Wait till you hear the interview with Jesse.
[00:38:47.022 --> 00:38:49.764]  It starts slow, and then it really... I've never interviewed him like this.
[00:38:49.804 --> 00:38:53.346]  He's very emotional for Jesse, who's all into being calm, cool, and collected.
[00:38:53.746 --> 00:38:55.407]  I would not want to be Chris Kyle right now.
[00:38:56.068 --> 00:38:57.649]  But this is the anatomy.
[00:38:57.709 --> 00:39:00.951]  Remember, they lied and said Saddam was throwing babies out of incubators.
[00:39:01.011 --> 00:39:02.072]  Not that Saddam's a good guy.
[00:39:02.092 --> 00:39:03.032]  The point is, they lied.
[00:39:03.352 --> 00:39:05.874]  Remember, Pat Tillman wrote letters home, said, I'm coming home to speak out.
[00:39:06.134 --> 00:39:08.616]  They claimed he died charging a hill to fight al-Qaeda.
[00:39:08.956 --> 00:39:09.636]  Really, the U.S.
[00:39:09.656 --> 00:39:10.617]  government shot him to death.
[00:39:10.657 --> 00:39:11.898]  That came out in the coroner report.
[00:39:12.478 --> 00:39:13.678]  Pat Tillman, yeah, government murdered him.
[00:39:13.698 --> 00:39:14.859]  Look it up, folks, if you're a new listener.
[00:39:15.539 --> 00:39:16.739]  So, I've talked to his brother.
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:20.300]  So the point is, all of this is going on.
[00:39:21.401 --> 00:39:26.662]  Private Lynch, that whole fake thing where she didn't shoot all those troops, those Iraqis, that was all made up.
[00:39:27.282 --> 00:39:29.003]  They do these PR reports.
[00:39:29.703 --> 00:39:32.704]  And this guy's hooked up heavy with some really nasty groups.
[00:39:33.144 --> 00:39:35.505]  He comes out to assassinate Ventura's character.
[00:39:35.525 --> 00:39:38.926]  If you don't know the backstory of this, we're going to Tyrell in just a moment.
[00:39:40.592 --> 00:39:43.617]  They hire Ventura right before 2003 at MSNBC.
[00:39:44.218 --> 00:39:46.821]  He's got this nine plus million dollar contract for three years.
[00:39:46.861 --> 00:39:48.384]  He thinks great, big primetime show.
[00:39:49.245 --> 00:39:56.156]  They get ready for the Iraq war and they say, look, you can keep the money if you don't criticize the war, but if you keep criticizing the war, you're gone.
[00:39:57.150 --> 00:39:59.031]  He says, well, I'm just talking, I'm going to criticize the war.
[00:39:59.071 --> 00:40:00.111]  They say, you're fired.
[00:40:00.131 --> 00:40:01.552]  We're going to keep giving you the money.
[00:40:01.592 --> 00:40:02.672]  We're holding your contract.
[00:40:02.732 --> 00:40:04.613]  You can't give media interviews for three years.
[00:40:05.373 --> 00:40:09.415]  And later he was told by NBC and insiders that was done because they knew you were going to be anti-war.
[00:40:09.775 --> 00:40:11.456]  They'd assessed you golden handcuffs.
[00:40:12.396 --> 00:40:13.656]  So they're scared of Ventura.
[00:40:14.377 --> 00:40:17.478]  They know he's one of the few political dark horse wild cards.
[00:40:19.215 --> 00:40:20.476]  This is a big deal, folks.
[00:40:20.516 --> 00:40:25.460]  This is another sign they're going into Iran, that they would totally make this up.
[00:40:26.201 --> 00:40:28.983]  This is a lot bigger than Jesse Ventura or Ron Paul or whatever.
[00:40:29.023 --> 00:40:32.346]  This is about the fact that they can politically destroy people.
[00:40:32.647 --> 00:40:34.468]  Tyrell, I wanted to intro that.
[00:40:34.488 --> 00:40:38.592]  We're going to come back here in a moment and start the interview with your dad, but most of it's coming up in the next hour.
[00:40:38.612 --> 00:40:39.252]  It's about 35 minutes long.
[00:40:41.374 --> 00:40:41.734]  Wow!
[00:40:41.754 --> 00:40:45.798]  You know, before, you could get a hold of your dad because he just entered Mexico driving an RV.
[00:40:45.838 --> 00:40:47.560]  They launched this, you know, right at the right time.
[00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:51.524]  We knew this had to be made up just because of your dad's view of the troops and how much he loves them.
[00:40:51.944 --> 00:40:53.545]  But now, he said it's pure bull.
[00:40:53.886 --> 00:40:54.446]  But wow!
[00:40:54.566 --> 00:40:55.607]  Amazing PSYOP.
[00:40:55.728 --> 00:40:57.029]  Why do you think this is being done?
[00:40:57.449 --> 00:40:59.971]  I think it's being done for exactly those same reasons.
[00:41:00.051 --> 00:41:02.913]  You know, you have to discredit the pacifists at home.
[00:41:03.214 --> 00:41:16.264]  You know, if you have people that speak out against global wars and things of that nature, who hold sway with the working class and the general public of this country, and also with the people who, you know, will end up sacrificing their children to these wars,
[00:41:17.204 --> 00:41:19.266]  Uh, you know, you have to assassinate that.
[00:41:19.326 --> 00:41:20.327]  So what better way to do it?
[00:41:20.367 --> 00:41:21.749]  You don't have to put a bullet in him.
[00:41:21.769 --> 00:41:22.449]  What better way to do it?
[00:41:22.469 --> 00:41:32.178]  You have a fellow Navy SEAL come out and spread flagrant lies, things that Jesse would never, ever say, uh, on, on, on, you know, your, your, your...
[00:41:32.816 --> 00:41:38.798]  You know, your government propaganda news channels like Fox News and the rest of them.
[00:41:39.059 --> 00:41:43.861]  You know, I find it very interesting, and we'll get to Jesse's interview, but here's an interesting observation.
[00:41:44.521 --> 00:42:01.928]  O'Reilly and a lot of these other people, you know, Brian Kilmeade, all of them, who are all outraged and appalled at what this Kyle claims Jesse said about saying, you know, you people deserve to lose a few soldiers, deserve to lose a few guys.
[00:42:02.714 --> 00:42:06.358]  They're all appalled by that and that statement, even though Jesse never said it.
[00:42:06.379 --> 00:42:07.680]  They're appalled by that statement.
[00:42:08.061 --> 00:42:15.109]  Well, I find it very hypocritical that these are the same people that are the biggest cheerleaders and are the biggest pro-war people.
[00:42:15.129 --> 00:42:16.110]  Well, you know what?
[00:42:16.271 --> 00:42:17.352]  They're sending U.S.
[00:42:17.412 --> 00:42:20.776]  soldiers off to die by cheerleading these wars, so what's the difference?
[00:42:22.602 --> 00:42:28.667]  But I don't like to talk about your dad privately, but in shooting three seasons of a TV show with him, I've flown with him, hung out with him a lot.
[00:42:29.227 --> 00:42:39.415]  I mean, he's a guy that hides his emotions, but he shakes troops' hands, gets tears in his eyes, always talks about these wars are killing great troops, it's the politicians' fault, the troops are still heroes.
[00:42:39.835 --> 00:42:46.940]  This is designed like a dark sword to stab Jesse in the heart politically and turn the seals against him.
[00:42:47.281 --> 00:42:49.923]  I want to come back and talk more about this, then we'll start the interview.
[00:42:50.623 --> 00:42:55.208]  With Jesse Ventura, and it starts powerful, but gets really powerful towards the end.
[00:42:55.228 --> 00:42:56.710]  It's all coming up.
[00:42:56.730 --> 00:42:57.211]  Stay with us.
[00:43:01.237 --> 00:43:05.479]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[00:43:05.779 --> 00:43:06.400]  Number one.
[00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:09.862]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:43:10.122 --> 00:43:10.702]  Number two.
[00:43:10.982 --> 00:43:15.545]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:43:15.885 --> 00:43:16.325]  It's true.
[00:43:16.625 --> 00:43:21.168]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:43:21.488 --> 00:43:22.028]  Number 3.
[00:43:22.308 --> 00:43:25.589]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:29.591]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:43:29.811 --> 00:43:30.351]  Number 4.
[00:43:30.611 --> 00:43:32.972]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:43:33.372 --> 00:43:36.753]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:43:37.054 --> 00:43:37.254]  Number 5.
[00:43:37.834 --> 00:43:41.755]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:43:41.975 --> 00:43:46.737]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:43:47.037 --> 00:43:51.060]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.762]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:43:52.982 --> 00:43:55.063]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:43:55.244 --> 00:43:57.585]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:44:02.964 --> 00:44:06.607]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:44:06.927 --> 00:44:15.073]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:44:15.794 --> 00:44:19.837]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:44:20.437 --> 00:44:31.246]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:44:31.866 --> 00:44:40.870]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:44:41.391 --> 00:44:46.433]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:44:46.813 --> 00:44:53.996]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:44:54.297 --> 00:44:57.058]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:45:02.225 --> 00:45:05.869]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:45:06.249 --> 00:45:09.272]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:45:09.493 --> 00:45:14.298]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:45:14.318 --> 00:45:20.564]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:45:20.684 --> 00:45:22.927]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:45:23.467 --> 00:45:23.747]  Tim Geithner?
[00:45:23.767 --> 00:45:24.187]  Bernanke?
[00:45:24.267 --> 00:45:24.908]  They're arsonists!
[00:45:24.948 --> 00:45:26.208]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:45:26.228 --> 00:45:28.469]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:45:42.355 --> 00:45:49.302]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:45:49.642 --> 00:45:58.751]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:46:00.936 --> 00:46:02.198]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:46:02.238 --> 00:46:07.585]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:46:07.825 --> 00:46:12.451]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:46:12.852 --> 00:46:13.252]  It's true.
[00:46:13.332 --> 00:46:17.898]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:46:18.399 --> 00:46:23.102]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:46:23.643 --> 00:46:25.564]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:46:25.944 --> 00:46:30.547]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:46:30.747 --> 00:46:31.648]  And here's the best part.
[00:46:31.868 --> 00:46:34.630]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:46:34.650 --> 00:46:38.252]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:46:38.552 --> 00:46:41.394]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:46:41.755 --> 00:46:43.636]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:46:43.976 --> 00:46:44.897]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:46:48.519 --> 00:46:52.242]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:46:52.763 --> 00:46:57.286]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:46:57.587 --> 00:47:00.069]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:08.916]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:20.922 --> 00:47:24.364]  On the march, the empire is on the run.
[00:47:25.084 --> 00:47:28.806]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:47:30.026 --> 00:47:32.708]  So imagine, you're Jesse Venturi, you speak your mind.
[00:47:34.110 --> 00:47:35.931]  You got millions of people that listen to you.
[00:47:36.051 --> 00:47:39.874]  Every book that comes out exposing the New World Order is a best-seller on the New York Times.
[00:47:40.755 --> 00:47:46.199]  And you get the word that you were road-racing in California, even though you're sitting there in your home in Minnesota.
[00:47:46.579 --> 00:47:52.363]  Then you drive down to your home in Baja, California and learn you were knocked out and that you love Navy SEALs dying.
[00:47:54.745 --> 00:47:57.827]  And you watch some punk on TV saying it over and over again.
[00:47:57.907 --> 00:48:01.050]  And people taking it like it's absolute proof with no proof.
[00:48:02.071 --> 00:48:07.393]  This is an illustration of the type of people we're dealing with.
[00:48:07.413 --> 00:48:09.995]  And they're doing similar stuff to Ron Paul right now.
[00:48:10.095 --> 00:48:10.835]  Remember that.
[00:48:11.735 --> 00:48:16.858]  Don't right off the bat believe something when CNN says, Ron Paul's putting out ads bashing Asians.
[00:48:17.574 --> 00:48:20.575]  Two days later, it's admitted somebody else made it.
[00:48:21.095 --> 00:48:27.338]  Now going back to Tyrell Ventura, Ty, other points you'd like to make before we get to this interview with your dad?
[00:48:27.358 --> 00:48:36.321]  I know I asked you on here and there's so many points we could make, but I mean this really shows how scared they are of him and anybody else that's got a name that'll criticize what they're doing.
[00:48:36.781 --> 00:48:41.922]  Well, I agree, and let's also just look at how operations like this work.
[00:48:42.743 --> 00:48:49.964]  You know, somewhere the CIA has basically a rough kind of psychological profile, or a profile they put together on Jesse Ventura.
[00:48:50.265 --> 00:48:54.226]  They kind of know, like, how he acts, things like that.
[00:48:54.266 --> 00:48:56.486]  They can look at his record as governor, things like that.
[00:48:56.526 --> 00:48:57.987]  They know he's big and he's loud.
[00:48:58.287 --> 00:48:59.327]  He speaks his mind.
[00:49:00.147 --> 00:49:02.329]  Um, you know, so they look at things like that.
[00:49:02.649 --> 00:49:16.540]  And then what they do in concocting a completely false story to convince the average John Q. citizen, who doesn't necessarily follow every Jesse's word, but kind of is aware of him, and then knows, okay, yeah, he's kind of a loud guy, speaks his mind, controversial guy.
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:21.224]  Um, so when they want to spread false stories through puppets like Kyle,
[00:49:22.084 --> 00:49:26.606]  Uh, they put little details that kind of sound like Jesse, but aren't really.
[00:49:26.866 --> 00:49:39.510]  You know, so they put just enough details to make it seem like, well, that could be Jesse, uh, in his story, to where then that way John Q. Public, when they hear that, it says, well, I know he's kind of loud, and I know he's kind of controversial, that must be him.
[00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:41.731]  You know, uh, it sounds just like him.
[00:49:42.271 --> 00:49:46.372]  You know, but then, but then they mix in these, like, flagrant lies within that story.
[00:49:46.392 --> 00:49:51.374]  And they do that whenever they're trying to publicly assassinate someone, uh, you know, through the media and things like that.
[00:49:52.037 --> 00:49:59.259]  And why would they be going after him, suing the TSA, going all over the media, criticizing their groping and criminal activity?
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:10.963]  Because if they're locking down this country and then, you know, going to lock us down into a police state and tell us all it's for our own good, but then you have other people like
[00:50:11.423 --> 00:50:24.768]  Mr. Ventura, you know, like my father, like yourself, you know, saying no, this is BS, this is not, this is a violation of our Constitution, who are willing to take it to courts to fight it, and who are very vocal with television shows and other such things, you know, that's a threat to them.
[00:50:24.968 --> 00:50:27.009]  Exactly, I was about to add, I was about to add.
[00:50:27.149 --> 00:50:39.934]  They know that they're ramping up to an Iran, they want a war with Iran, they want that because it's millions of dollars, it's what they've been designed, that's why they went for, I mean, if you think about it, Afghanistan and Iraq border Iran, it's a complete, they have them cornered.
[00:50:42.130 --> 00:50:59.999]  It's so logical that our next place they want to go is Iran, but they know people like Ron Paul, people like my father, people like yourself, are not going to stand for that and are going to be very vocal and against that war and call them out when they BS and they try to lie and deceive the people into believing that Iran is a threat to the United States.
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:00.960]  It is not.
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:03.221]  Well, you're right.
[00:51:03.361 --> 00:51:04.241]  It's super creepy.
[00:51:04.281 --> 00:51:05.583]  They're demonizing Ron Paul.
[00:51:05.603 --> 00:51:06.864]  They're demonizing myself.
[00:51:07.264 --> 00:51:12.688]  Now with Jesse, they're coming out and saying he's at a wake, saying, I'm glad you're dead to the family.
[00:51:12.788 --> 00:51:16.191]  I mean, just the most made up, horrible thing you could say.
[00:51:16.211 --> 00:51:19.274]  And this guy now is seeking government contracts.
[00:51:19.814 --> 00:51:23.817]  He's a mercenary to train our local police and Homeland Security.
[00:51:24.238 --> 00:51:25.399]  Clearly put up to it.
[00:51:26.199 --> 00:51:34.701]  If you look at the information, and here's your dad criticizing the TSA, criticizing JFK, 9-11, the wars, best-selling books.
[00:51:35.221 --> 00:51:36.702]  They know his new book's coming out.
[00:51:36.982 --> 00:51:39.242]  They know he was thinking about running for president.
[00:51:39.643 --> 00:51:41.743]  This is a preemptive strike against him.
[00:51:42.063 --> 00:51:49.125]  And Ty, it happens right as they know he crosses into Mexico and doesn't have a cell phone for three days to get to Baja.
[00:51:50.384 --> 00:51:55.492]  I mean, we've known for a long time that they tap our phones or watch our emails.
[00:51:55.592 --> 00:51:56.834]  I'm sure they do because of
[00:51:58.075 --> 00:52:00.837]  Your dad's been visited by the CIA when he was governor.
[00:52:01.037 --> 00:52:01.497]  Exactly.
[00:52:01.557 --> 00:52:04.479]  So they knew when he was crossing the border and it's very convenient.
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:15.246]  It's also very convenient that almost every show that has had this guy on is a cable news show that Jesse has been on and has totally made their hosts look like buffoons.
[00:52:15.647 --> 00:52:23.012]  The only show he hasn't been on is Bill O'Reilly's and Jesse has numerously called Bill O'Reilly a coward for not having him on and debating him on these current issues.
[00:52:23.512 --> 00:52:24.913]  And I find it very convenient.
[00:52:25.693 --> 00:52:27.214]  Well, I've got to say it about your dad.
[00:52:27.354 --> 00:52:31.137]  On all these shows, just his straightforward approach, he dominates them.
[00:52:31.497 --> 00:52:33.899]  He has annihilated all of these shows.
[00:52:34.279 --> 00:52:46.828]  Yeah, so I mean, that's why it's very interesting that, you know, Opie and Anthony break the story with that weird idiot Jim Norton, you know, and all these little pipsqueak types who, you know, have never really done anything in their lives.
[00:52:47.688 --> 00:52:53.972]  Uh, you know, it's very convenient that they are so welcoming of this guy without even questioning the authenticity of his story.
[00:52:54.152 --> 00:52:55.873]  Oh, okay, he must be telling the truth.
[00:52:56.213 --> 00:52:56.433]  Why?
[00:52:56.573 --> 00:52:58.254]  Oh, well, he's a soldier, he works for the government.
[00:52:58.814 --> 00:53:00.195]  Oh, okay, that's it?
[00:53:00.235 --> 00:53:01.336]  That's all they have for proof?
[00:53:02.296 --> 00:53:03.797]  You're taking this man's word for it?
[00:53:03.957 --> 00:53:06.938]  Well, coming up in the interview, they've got a big problem.
[00:53:06.998 --> 00:53:14.801]  It turns out the owner of this bar, McPease, was the guy that trained your dad and was like, you know, the head trainer and they're good friends.
[00:53:15.421 --> 00:53:22.163]  And so this is all going to come out later that it never happened and that it would have been, you know, well known if this happened.
[00:53:22.703 --> 00:53:26.665]  And that he wasn't there to speak to a graduating class, like the guy said.
[00:53:26.985 --> 00:53:27.926]  And it's all fake.
[00:53:28.806 --> 00:53:30.687]  And again, it's an example of a psyop.
[00:53:30.727 --> 00:53:36.831]  But if they can claim your dad was throwing babies out of incubators just long enough, it'll work for them.
[00:53:37.071 --> 00:53:39.232]  And I agree with you, Ty, because we've been thinking about this.
[00:53:39.752 --> 00:53:42.313]  Before I got you on air, you said, you know, I think it's about Iran.
[00:53:42.333 --> 00:53:45.075]  And I had separately already talked about that with your dad.
[00:53:45.575 --> 00:53:55.301]  Yeah, no, it feels that way, because the more I read about all this hubble-loo that they're making up about Iran's big imminent threat to Israel and to us, you know, I'm sorry.
[00:53:55.401 --> 00:54:00.384]  Iran, you know, the leader, was it Ahmadinejad?
[00:54:00.404 --> 00:54:02.385]  He doesn't make decisions in that country.
[00:54:02.425 --> 00:54:08.529]  People have to realize he's pretty much just like a puppet that they kind of put out front, and he just does his piece.
[00:54:08.649 --> 00:54:10.931]  But really, you know, he doesn't make any decisions there.
[00:54:10.971 --> 00:54:14.633]  He can be as crazy as he wants to be, but he doesn't have any legislative control.
[00:54:15.023 --> 00:54:16.505]  Yes, the moolahs that run it all.
[00:54:25.973 --> 00:54:32.435]  Well, look, look, Ty, here's the reason the former head of the Mossad that Netanyahu fired a year ago because he wouldn't go along with it said.
[00:54:32.815 --> 00:54:38.376]  Here's the reason Fox Fallon and Admiral Mullen and the last, you know, three Joint Chiefs of Staff in the U.S.
[00:54:38.396 --> 00:54:39.096]  said don't do it.
[00:54:39.596 --> 00:54:42.037]  Iran hasn't been under 15 years of sanctions.
[00:54:42.477 --> 00:54:43.938]  Iran is 75 million people, not 25 million.
[00:54:45.718 --> 00:54:47.279]  Iran's got high-tech weapons.
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:49.221]  Iran is going to block the Strait of Hormuz.
[00:54:49.782 --> 00:54:57.488]  It is going to cause all Hades to break loose, but that's exactly what the bankers want to distract us.
[00:54:57.568 --> 00:55:05.395]  I mean, this is not going to be some third world country that, you know, that the globalists are just using us to invade and destroy.
[00:55:05.415 --> 00:55:06.936]  This is going to be a real war.
[00:55:08.573 --> 00:55:08.833]  I don't
[00:55:24.292 --> 00:55:27.253]  Yeah, he said, here's the secret plan, we're gonna invade eight of them!
[00:55:27.493 --> 00:55:44.438]  Yeah, exactly, and now a lot of them have fallen because of revolutions and things like that, but if you look at the, if you trace the history of some of the people in those revolutions, they're clearly CIA and intelligence people, like the general in the Egyptian army that was fighting back against the government was a complete CIA guy.
[00:55:45.198 --> 00:55:52.320]  You know, and so you see all these countries falling, it's exactly falling into place for what they've been plotting for probably the last 20 years, 30 years.
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:57.583]  Well, that's what's frustrating is America is a good country full of good people.
[00:55:58.003 --> 00:56:07.350]  We have global mega banks that have taken over our government, are using us to take over the world, and they're playing us off against China, against the Iranians.
[00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:08.491]  They're globalists.
[00:56:08.531 --> 00:56:09.632]  They're against countries.
[00:56:09.952 --> 00:56:14.916]  So we think of it as countries, America versus China versus Iran, Russia.
[00:56:15.356 --> 00:56:16.617]  It's way past that.
[00:56:16.877 --> 00:56:18.839]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:18.899 --> 00:56:24.424]  We are simply tools that the super corporations and the super banks of the world use to make more money.
[00:56:25.044 --> 00:56:29.028]  And the slave labor that we give them and the soldiers that we provide them.
[00:56:29.909 --> 00:56:30.950]  And that's what's so tragic.
[00:56:30.990 --> 00:56:35.534]  You have very honorable men and women in uniform who are basically used as pawns for
[00:56:37.236 --> 00:56:40.739]  I tell you what, Ty, there's a little five-minute segment coming up at the start of the next hour.
[00:56:40.759 --> 00:56:51.730]  I want to hold you over to there, and then I'll just come back and air the entire 35-minute Governor Jesse Ventura interview, and then cover some other news and take calls in the last 15-20 minutes of the broadcast.
[00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:55.894]  We're going to go to break here, but when we come back briefly, I mean, look at these headlines.
[00:56:55.914 --> 00:57:00.218]  Because Fox News, I watched it, spent more time in other channels
[00:57:00.959 --> 00:57:06.860]  on your father trying to destroy him with these made-up fairy tales than they did on this.
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:07.701]  Look at these headlines.
[00:57:08.201 --> 00:57:12.802]  Iran decides to close Strait of Hormuz if oil exports are blocked.
[00:57:13.442 --> 00:57:15.683]  The EU's set to vote tomorrow to shut it down.
[00:57:15.723 --> 00:57:16.403]  That's going to happen.
[00:57:16.883 --> 00:57:21.224]  American, British, Israeli and Iranian warships sailing towards confrontation.
[00:57:21.604 --> 00:57:26.345]  Jerusalem Post reports in Financial Times of London, Iran, Israel and U.S.
[00:57:26.425 --> 00:57:29.446]  plan gulf exercises all at the same time.
[00:57:30.046 --> 00:57:30.867]  I mean, it's on.
[00:57:31.287 --> 00:57:35.632]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, this is what the RAND Corporation called for two years ago.
[00:57:36.032 --> 00:57:38.214]  It's something bigger than just a regional war.
[00:57:38.554 --> 00:57:41.898]  Most analysts say this could kick off World War III.
[00:57:42.358 --> 00:57:47.323]  Second Hour coming up on your local station and the audio streams at InfoWars.com.
[00:57:47.343 --> 00:57:47.843]  Stay with us.
[00:57:48.104 --> 00:57:49.165]  Jesse Ventura interview.
[00:57:51.348 --> 00:57:55.149]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are, a decade into the 21st century?
[00:57:55.469 --> 00:57:57.370]  Record foreclosure rates for homes.
[00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:59.251]  If not yours, your neighbor's.
[00:57:59.611 --> 00:58:02.132]  Thankful for the unemployment checks since you were laid off.
[00:58:02.592 --> 00:58:09.074]  And placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[00:58:09.574 --> 00:58:09.954]  We're good to go.
[00:58:29.121 --> 00:58:29.341]  You bet!
[00:58:55.126 --> 00:58:56.066]  Tyranny is here.
[00:58:56.407 --> 00:58:59.908]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:59:00.328 --> 00:59:02.549]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:59:02.569 --> 00:59:07.992]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:59:08.432 --> 00:59:14.675]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:59:15.095 --> 00:59:20.640]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:24.763]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:59:25.243 --> 00:59:29.267]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:59:29.527 --> 00:59:35.091]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:59:35.492 --> 00:59:38.474]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:59:39.035 --> 00:59:40.476]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:59:41.016 --> 00:59:41.457]  It's here.

[00:59:52.161 --> 00:59:53.301]  Coast to Coast.
[00:59:53.682 --> 00:59:55.002]  Direct from Austin.
[00:59:55.742 --> 00:59:58.944]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:02.665 --> 01:00:08.697]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:09.298 --> 01:00:12.304]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:39.861]  Well, it says a lot about the establishment that they would concoct fairy tales about Jesse Ventura like we've discussed, and it does signify that they'd put golden handcuffs on him with an MSNBC contract on the eve of the Gulf War, and then after it happened, tell him, oh yeah, we did this on purpose, ha ha ha.
[01:00:40.902 --> 01:00:50.750]  I mean, they're making tens of millions per cruise missile, so why should they care about giving Ventura a contract and then contractually not letting him have free speech during a war?
[01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:56.154]  Now they're just having some guy who's launching a new mercenary organization.
[01:00:56.934 --> 01:01:01.358]  You know, Tyrell Ventura, son of Jesse Ventura, we talked.
[01:01:02.904 --> 01:01:11.615]  Privately about responses to this because your dad's not somebody to lay down especially to this great defamation You're like yeah, let's not get into it till it happens, but your dad coming up.
[01:01:12.055 --> 01:01:22.288]  You know does say there's gonna be action Taken the ball is already rolling I hope this Thai guy goes ahead and goes public and admits whoever basically hired him to do this
[01:01:22.964 --> 01:01:24.225]  It would be nice if he did that.
[01:01:24.385 --> 01:01:29.367]  I doubt he will because he's using the story to make money in his own pocket in his book.
[01:01:29.407 --> 01:01:30.768]  Controversy always sells.
[01:01:30.848 --> 01:01:31.608]  I wish that he would.
[01:01:31.628 --> 01:01:44.474]  I wish that he'd have the courage and the respect for his service and my father's service and all servicemen to not spread lies about each other and to defame each other.
[01:01:44.494 --> 01:01:46.074]  If anything, you guys are supposed to be brothers.
[01:01:46.094 --> 01:01:51.797]  It's a brotherhood and you should be looking out for each other, not spewing lies and hate
[01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:55.662]  Well, they're trying to create a political meme, Ty.
[01:01:56.022 --> 01:02:02.586]  Obviously, this Chris Kyle guy is against your father, but I'm glad he's striking back and it's not going to work.
[01:02:02.946 --> 01:02:05.208]  We've got three or four minutes left here in this short segment.
[01:02:06.008 --> 01:02:08.910]  Tell us about the upcoming season of Conspiracy Theory coming up.
[01:02:09.275 --> 01:02:10.195]  It's looking great.
[01:02:10.255 --> 01:02:12.797]  We're putting the episodes together right now.
[01:02:12.817 --> 01:02:19.699]  We're finally done physically shooting most of them, and now we're in the edit phase, putting them all together.
[01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:21.900]  And they're looking great.
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:27.323]  I think we're going to have a pretty great entertaining season, another season that's brand new.
[01:02:28.303 --> 01:02:32.085]  I'm now on the show investigating on camera, along with
[01:02:32.925 --> 01:02:33.626]  We're good to go.
[01:02:50.715 --> 01:02:57.879]  Yeah, this third series, you guys get into things that normally TV gets into in the first series, but you guys get into it from a real perspective.
[01:02:57.899 --> 01:03:01.201]  I'm amazed by the knowledge that Sean Stone has.
[01:03:01.221 --> 01:03:03.082]  It's been great being able to hang out with you guys.
[01:03:04.202 --> 01:03:07.064]  Looking at this, though, that's one point.
[01:03:07.104 --> 01:03:18.170]  Your dad's against the war, he exposes the TSA, the NDAA, but he's also been out there doing all these other things that upset the system.
[01:03:18.450 --> 01:03:18.890]  Of course.
[01:03:18.930 --> 01:03:30.517]  You know, anytime you have someone out there getting people to look at news or look at events in a different way than what they're being spoon-fed, that's always dangerous.
[01:03:30.557 --> 01:03:46.886]  Anyone who's a truth-teller in today's world, you know, and puts his ass on the line to try to bring people the truth, is always directly at the crosshairs for the people that don't want you listeners out there to have all the knowledge and all the facts.
[01:03:47.239 --> 01:03:57.963]  Well, the public doesn't know one-tenth, Ty, as you've broken down what happened behind the scenes with that FEMA camp special that only aired once and got censored with threats from Homeland Security.
[01:03:58.343 --> 01:04:02.285]  I mean, look, your dad and you and others have definitely gotten their attention.
[01:04:02.305 --> 01:04:03.486]  Oh, of course we have.
[01:04:03.546 --> 01:04:10.688]  And, you know, through the books and through the show and everything else, you know, we bring a little fear back on them.
[01:04:10.708 --> 01:04:14.530]  You know, all they want us to be is to be fearful and to be slaves.
[01:04:15.089 --> 01:04:21.135]  You know, work for nothing, be in debt, owe us all your money, and be scared of your neighbors, be scared of everything around you.
[01:04:21.755 --> 01:04:37.530]  And, you know, people like my father, and myself, and yourself, and most definitely Sean, you know, we're trying to get everyone to now no longer be afraid to ask the hard questions, to, you know, fight back against this system of tyranny, and this system of
[01:04:39.252 --> 01:04:41.273]  I couldn't say it better, my friend.
[01:04:41.413 --> 01:04:42.474]  Great job, Ty.
[01:04:42.894 --> 01:04:45.555]  And hopefully this week, as this develops, we'll be able to talk to you again.
[01:04:45.575 --> 01:04:47.236]  Hopefully Fox News will retract.
[01:04:47.917 --> 01:04:50.058]  Your dad's going to call for that coming up in the interview.
[01:04:50.418 --> 01:04:54.420]  I would so doubt that Fox News would ever retract.
[01:04:55.461 --> 01:04:56.021]  Well, they better.
[01:04:56.361 --> 01:04:57.382]  Well, listen, great job.
[01:04:57.402 --> 01:04:58.722]  We'll talk to you soon, my friend.
[01:04:58.762 --> 01:04:59.743]  Jesse Ventura coming up.
[01:05:00.657 --> 01:05:06.001]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:05:07.242 --> 01:05:12.026]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:05:12.386 --> 01:05:19.151]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:05:21.113 --> 01:05:23.415]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:05:25.176 --> 01:05:27.137]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:05:29.608 --> 01:05:33.470]  Put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:05:34.191 --> 01:05:37.312]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[01:05:38.033 --> 01:05:38.833]  Others don't.
[01:05:39.253 --> 01:05:41.134]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:05:41.394 --> 01:05:42.895]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[01:05:43.175 --> 01:05:45.737]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:05:46.077 --> 01:05:52.320]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:05:52.701 --> 01:05:54.922]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:05:55.402 --> 01:05:57.423]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[01:05:57.763 --> 01:05:58.264]  Others don't.
[01:06:03.652 --> 01:06:06.614]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:06:07.234 --> 01:06:14.119]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:14.139 --> 01:06:29.228]  Governor Jesse Ventura, we've seen a big national news story claiming that this Navy SEAL who just had a book come out this week at a bar knocked you down and then ran away because you were saying you were glad that Navy SEALs were dead.
[01:06:29.268 --> 01:06:31.890]  I mean, it sounds like something out of the Twilight Zone.
[01:06:34.031 --> 01:06:38.872]  Well, Alex, anyone that's ever heard me talk knows that that's not true at all.
[01:06:39.112 --> 01:06:45.194]  I have no idea why this person is saying it or for what purpose it's to serve.
[01:06:45.274 --> 01:06:54.637]  But, you know, if he stated that he struck me, knocked me down and then fled, I want people to understand clearly
[01:06:55.547 --> 01:07:04.215]  He's confessing them to the crime of assault and it's assault on a former governor, an elected official, a former elected official twice.
[01:07:05.035 --> 01:07:12.482]  I want to clear his name because he's confessing to assaulting me and it didn't happen.
[01:07:13.283 --> 01:07:20.269]  I can unequivocally tell you that I've never been punched in Coronado, California since I've been out of the Navy.
[01:07:21.025 --> 01:07:27.348]  I got out of the Navy in active duty in 1973 and I've never been struck by anyone.
[01:07:27.428 --> 01:07:42.314]  I've been out there multiple times for reunions that are the third weekend in August every year and this may have been the graduation what he's talking about in 06 of class 258 because it's traditional that
[01:07:43.115 --> 01:07:54.951]  When a hundred years I was class 58 when 158 graduated back I believe in the 80s I went to that graduation because that's a tradition and then when 258 graduated in 2006 I believe it was
[01:07:58.616 --> 01:07:59.377]  I went to that.
[01:08:00.197 --> 01:08:06.962]  And McP's Bar is owned by Doc McPartland, who is my SEAL cadre instructor.
[01:08:07.522 --> 01:08:14.066]  When I just came out of training, he instructed me in SEAL SBI, SEAL Basic Indoctrination.
[01:08:14.847 --> 01:08:16.908]  And he owns that establishment.
[01:08:17.288 --> 01:08:21.171]  And I would never, ever misbehave in the Doc's establishment.
[01:08:21.191 --> 01:08:22.632]  I have too much respect for him.
[01:08:22.652 --> 01:08:25.934]  And if people truly want to clear this up, call him.
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:38.186]  If a former governor within the SEAL community had been knocked down and hit and assaulted, it would have traveled through the SEAL community like wildfire.
[01:08:38.246 --> 01:08:45.631]  And for this to now say it happened five and a half or six years after it happened, that's absurd.
[01:08:46.011 --> 01:08:57.419]  But I want to state that even though this person is confessing to committing a crime against me of assault, I want to state unequivocally he is not guilty of that crime.
[01:08:58.166 --> 01:08:59.607]  Because he never hit me.
[01:09:00.087 --> 01:09:01.488]  I don't even know who he is.
[01:09:02.729 --> 01:09:04.850]  If I've met him or not, I don't know it.
[01:09:05.591 --> 01:09:09.233]  His name, I don't even know it right now, as I talk to you.
[01:09:09.874 --> 01:09:17.418]  I just know that he made accusations that he hit me back in 06, I guess, and that he fleed the bar.
[01:09:18.299 --> 01:09:25.704]  If that was true, Alex, maybe I should go up, since he's confessing to a crime, maybe I should go up and file the charges.
[01:09:26.284 --> 01:09:27.685]  And if he did do that,
[01:09:27.725 --> 01:09:29.286]  We're good to go.
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:52.862]  I got off active duty in 73.
[01:09:53.723 --> 01:10:04.313]  Nobody there have I ever been in any trouble or did anything but reunions and graduations or whatever it might have been or retirement.
[01:10:06.235 --> 01:10:08.938]  And the thing is you're never at McP's alone.
[01:10:09.733 --> 01:10:13.414]  You're there with your teammates and your classmates and you're all celebrating.
[01:10:13.734 --> 01:10:17.895]  When you go to McP's, there'll be at least five or six guys with you.
[01:10:18.315 --> 01:10:24.057]  Well, I would sure like to hear of a witness that saw of this event because it never happened.
[01:10:24.177 --> 01:10:25.838]  It's plain and that simple.
[01:10:25.958 --> 01:10:34.100]  And what does concern me is that this is two times now within about a two week period where the mainstream media has
[01:10:34.740 --> 01:11:04.092]  Has ran with something that was completely untrue as you know they stated that I was tailgating a car a couple weeks ago out in the San Fernando Valley on the way to the airport and that was solely not true because I haven't been to California for six months and I haven't flown in an airplane for 15 months and you can attest to that because you were with me the last time I flew in a commercial airliner and that was over well over a year ago so it's two times now
[01:11:04.172 --> 01:11:12.955]  Now that bogus, serious, false stories have been perpetuated out there by the mainstream media against me.
[01:11:12.975 --> 01:11:28.141]  And I guess, Alex, I can only say, maybe because I'm rattling my sword about the elections, maybe because I support Ron Paul, who's not popular, or they say he's fringe because he stands for peace.
[01:11:28.901 --> 01:11:37.226]  Maybe because I support peace and not war in this country now, that makes you a target for the people that do support war.
[01:11:37.307 --> 01:11:37.727]  I don't know.
[01:11:38.227 --> 01:11:46.572]  I'm only speculating there, but I'll let you have it, Alex, and you can speak, but I just want to tell you unequivocally, this event did not happen.
[01:11:47.113 --> 01:11:52.356]  And I can't speak to anything else that this person would say because I don't know him.
[01:11:52.936 --> 01:11:55.238]  To my knowledge, I've never ever even met him.
[01:11:55.898 --> 01:11:57.159]  Maybe I have, I don't know.
[01:11:57.539 --> 01:12:01.340]  But you know, you meet a lot of the younger guys but you don't recall who they are.
[01:12:01.841 --> 01:12:12.805]  But never have I ever been hit or treated disrespectfully in the Navy UDT SEAL community at McPhee's Bar or any official UDT SEAL function in any way.
[01:12:13.185 --> 01:12:15.266]  In fact, I'm treated with honor and dignity.
[01:12:15.686 --> 01:12:28.402]  At all times, so I don't know where this story or why this young gentleman wants to plead that he committed a crime against me, but I can unequivocally plead for his innocence because the event never happened.
[01:12:31.105 --> 01:12:31.325]  Yeah.
[01:12:31.565 --> 01:12:36.749]  Governor Jesse Ventura joins us from Mexico down on the Baja via audio.
[01:12:36.769 --> 01:12:39.671]  Skypes was a bit of a delay when I talked to him.
[01:12:40.752 --> 01:12:43.734]  Tyrell was just able to get a hold of him yesterday.
[01:12:43.754 --> 01:12:52.199]  This strangely enough happened right as Jesse drove his RV into Mexico and was out of phone reach for three days driving to the Baja.
[01:12:52.820 --> 01:13:00.605]  He drove because he refuses to fly all the way from Minnesota to Baja and he just learned from his son that on Bill O'Reilly's Fox
[01:13:01.245 --> 01:13:08.675]  On at least 10 other Fox shows, syndicated radio, newspapers, they are all reporting as if it's absolute fact.
[01:13:08.715 --> 01:13:12.980]  Here's a Fox News headline, Navy SEAL sniper punched out Jesse Ventura.
[01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:18.747]  But sir, his name is Chris Kyle, he has a book coming out, he's starting a big mercenary...
[01:13:19.648 --> 01:13:20.129]  We're good to go.
[01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:44.052]  Obviously, this would have been out in the news beforehand, but that's not the big issue.
[01:13:44.572 --> 01:13:51.116]  And I'm sad to have to raise this to you, but I know in your Facebook comment, also posted at InfoWars.com, you've responded.
[01:13:51.557 --> 01:14:04.926]  He has gone on all these shows and said, it's terrible, there's the family with the wake, he's talking bad about this Congressional Medal of Honor winner, and I say, please stop, and Jesse says,
[01:14:05.746 --> 01:14:07.087]  They deserve to die.
[01:14:07.147 --> 01:14:08.268]  You deserve to die.
[01:14:08.308 --> 01:14:13.012]  I mean, clearly the most horrible thing you could say designed to destroy your character.
[01:14:13.052 --> 01:14:15.934]  If this isn't defamation, I don't know what is.
[01:14:15.994 --> 01:14:18.036]  It's one thing to say, I'm a tough guy.
[01:14:18.176 --> 01:14:21.939]  I, you know, knocked Jesse Ventura down and then ran away, which makes no sense.
[01:14:22.319 --> 01:14:25.741]  And then to defame the Seals and say they teach us to punch you once and run away.
[01:14:26.062 --> 01:14:28.704]  I've been contacted by Seals and others saying that's pure bull.
[01:14:29.104 --> 01:14:38.166]  But the fact, Governor, that he would say that you were celebrating in front of a family the death of their son, I mean, this is incredible, Governor.
[01:14:38.206 --> 01:14:39.006]  What do you say to that?
[01:14:40.926 --> 01:14:47.267]  Well, I say that, you know, that's, you know, I have never supported the Iraq War.
[01:14:49.047 --> 01:14:50.628]  And let me say this clearly.
[01:14:51.028 --> 01:14:55.208]  Wars are not caused by the soldiers, the sailors, and the airmen.
[01:14:55.969 --> 01:14:58.249]  Wars are caused by politicians.
[01:14:59.173 --> 01:15:01.394]  Politicians take us to war.
[01:15:02.335 --> 01:15:08.319]  And I have been critical, so critical, of the politicians that took us to the Iraq War.
[01:15:08.859 --> 01:15:10.520]  And I have every right to do so.
[01:15:11.041 --> 01:15:18.465]  But I can tell you, Alex Jones, I have all the sympathy in the world for the soldiers, having been one.
[01:15:19.006 --> 01:15:20.687]  And anyone that questions
[01:15:21.887 --> 01:15:27.908]  My patriotism that I would behave this manner, that's a direct insult to me, my family.
[01:15:28.468 --> 01:15:31.849]  It's a direct insult to my mother and father.
[01:15:32.249 --> 01:15:36.150]  My father had six bronze battle stars in World War II.
[01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:40.630]  My mother was a World War II veteran, a nurse in North Africa.
[01:15:41.130 --> 01:15:47.732]  My brother is a Vietnam veteran, served in Da Nang, and myself, a veteran.
[01:15:48.112 --> 01:15:50.252]  My entire family are veterans.
[01:15:50.652 --> 01:15:52.393]  We were all enlisted men.
[01:15:52.413 --> 01:15:56.796]  We were at the bottom rung of who joins and goes in Africa.
[01:15:56.956 --> 01:15:57.737]  All right, folks.
[01:15:58.417 --> 01:16:00.638]  We're gonna come back with this interview I taped earlier today.
[01:16:01.139 --> 01:16:05.361]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:16:05.682 --> 01:16:06.262]  Number one.
[01:16:06.602 --> 01:16:09.744]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:16:10.004 --> 01:16:10.564]  Number 2.
[01:16:10.885 --> 01:16:15.427]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:16:15.767 --> 01:16:16.207]  It's true.
[01:16:16.508 --> 01:16:21.070]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:16:21.390 --> 01:16:21.911]  Number 3.
[01:16:22.211 --> 01:16:25.493]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:16:25.793 --> 01:16:29.515]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:16:29.715 --> 01:16:30.255]  Number 4.
[01:16:30.496 --> 01:16:32.857]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:16:33.257 --> 01:16:39.299]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:16:39.319 --> 01:16:46.642]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:16:46.923 --> 01:16:50.944]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:16:51.104 --> 01:16:52.645]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:16:52.885 --> 01:16:54.966]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:16:55.126 --> 01:16:57.467]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:17:02.011 --> 01:17:03.513]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:17:03.713 --> 01:17:08.759]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:17:09.039 --> 01:17:10.381]  Saving means to make money.
[01:17:10.561 --> 01:17:19.351]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:17:20.092 --> 01:17:27.174]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:17:27.614 --> 01:17:35.236]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:17:35.616 --> 01:17:40.538]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:17:40.838 --> 01:17:43.018]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:17:45.759 --> 01:17:48.700]  Call 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at five star soap dot com.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:56.904]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at five star soap dot com.
[01:18:01.832 --> 01:18:05.453]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:18:05.833 --> 01:18:08.854]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:18:09.074 --> 01:18:13.875]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:18:13.895 --> 01:18:20.097]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:18:20.257 --> 01:18:22.498]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:18:23.058 --> 01:18:23.338]  Tim Geithner?
[01:18:23.358 --> 01:18:23.778]  Bernanke?
[01:18:23.878 --> 01:18:24.499]  They're arsonists!
[01:18:24.539 --> 01:18:25.799]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:18:25.819 --> 01:18:28.060]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:18:41.946 --> 01:18:48.855]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.

[01:19:06.914 --> 01:19:08.395]  If not yours, your neighbor's.
[01:19:08.775 --> 01:19:11.296]  Thankful for the unemployment check since you were laid off.
[01:19:11.736 --> 01:19:18.218]  And placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[01:19:18.778 --> 01:19:26.883]  As you ever think your future would feel this out of control, the fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control.
[01:19:27.183 --> 01:19:28.444]  Your greatest dependency.
[01:19:28.724 --> 01:19:29.765]  Your food supply.
[01:19:30.145 --> 01:19:33.987]  Make 2012 the year you take control by getting prepared.

[01:20:05.622 --> 01:20:08.829]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:21.932 --> 01:20:27.097]  Okay, let's get back into more of this interview I taped earlier today that we're premiering.
[01:20:27.677 --> 01:20:34.023]  Former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura setting the record straight and he calls for Fox News to retract and others.
[01:20:35.012 --> 01:20:39.934]  And basically lets him know that he's going to be coming after him for what they've done.
[01:20:39.954 --> 01:20:46.137]  And you can also hear later, I bring it up to Jesse, his wife in the background is a really nice lady.
[01:20:46.637 --> 01:20:48.918]  I've never heard her in an interview, you know, talking.
[01:20:48.978 --> 01:20:52.040]  She's obviously upset by this as well.
[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:57.882]  But this is the anatomy of a PSYOP, of a hit piece against real Americans.
[01:20:58.303 --> 01:20:59.103]  Here's the rest of it.
[01:21:01.087 --> 01:21:03.248]  My entire family are veterans.
[01:21:03.628 --> 01:21:05.408]  We were all enlisted men.
[01:21:06.008 --> 01:21:11.250]  We were at the bottom rung of who joins and goes and has to fight and go to war.
[01:21:12.150 --> 01:21:23.072]  So for someone to state that I would take joy and pleasure and especially one of my SEAL teammates would die, that I would enjoy that, is despicable.
[01:21:23.092 --> 01:21:25.313]  It's wrong.
[01:21:25.913 --> 01:21:28.394]  And this never happened.
[01:21:28.414 --> 01:21:29.294]  And I can't
[01:21:30.197 --> 01:21:32.478]  Know what the motives are for this?
[01:21:33.819 --> 01:21:43.443]  I can only assume that obviously the war machine or the people that support war do not like to hear people talk who don't support war.
[01:21:43.803 --> 01:21:48.385]  But I have never ever wished death upon any military serviceman.
[01:21:48.505 --> 01:21:50.346]  Alex, that's the most ridiculous thing.
[01:21:50.766 --> 01:21:51.807]  We've known each other.
[01:21:52.147 --> 01:21:54.688]  Go back and look at everything I've ever said.
[01:21:55.618 --> 01:21:57.499]  In public, that is recorded.
[01:21:57.759 --> 01:21:59.320]  You always say the same thing.
[01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:06.483]  You always say, I mean, I've been in airports where you shake the troops' hands, thank them for their service, get a tear in your eye and say, be safe.
[01:22:06.763 --> 01:22:09.905]  You've always said you're against the wars, feeding these good men and women in there.
[01:22:10.225 --> 01:22:17.108]  When I called you in the Navy SEALs helicopter, the ones that knew about the Bin Laden raid, and it blew up, you got upset on the phone.
[01:22:17.508 --> 01:22:21.150]  And this is clearly designed, he says it with real pleasure in his eyes,
[01:22:21.970 --> 01:22:25.172]  To make the military and the Navy SEAL community turn against you.
[01:22:25.252 --> 01:22:30.374]  It's the worst thing, the worst story that you could ever make up.
[01:22:31.134 --> 01:22:32.475]  And it is vicious.
[01:22:32.715 --> 01:22:35.976]  And I have to think it's more than to just sell this book.
[01:22:36.497 --> 01:22:44.040]  When you find out he's going after government contracts internationally with the military and domestic police agencies with his craft group.
[01:22:44.980 --> 01:22:46.321]  It is super creepy.
[01:22:46.381 --> 01:22:51.865]  Governor, two Fox News, who's the main, I mean, they're acting like this is the number one story in the country.
[01:22:51.905 --> 01:22:56.088]  They are, I mean, for four days, every other show, this guy's on there.
[01:22:56.368 --> 01:22:57.649]  They're reporting it as it's a fact.
[01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:59.530]  They're clearly going after you.
[01:22:59.970 --> 01:23:02.292]  Obviously, do you want to call for a retraction?
[01:23:02.492 --> 01:23:06.234]  Because they don't put Navy SEAL claims he punched out Ventura.
[01:23:06.554 --> 01:23:08.836]  They state it like they got video of it.
[01:23:09.036 --> 01:23:10.800]  They never try to call the bar owner.
[01:23:11.021 --> 01:23:12.485]  They never call for witnesses.
[01:23:12.725 --> 01:23:14.971]  They just put him on TV like it's true.
[01:23:15.953 --> 01:23:17.176]  And this is unbelievable.
[01:23:19.392 --> 01:23:27.155]  Well, certainly I would like a retraction and, uh, you know, I, I've, uh, I, I'm, you know, I'm going to defend myself, Alex.
[01:23:27.215 --> 01:23:33.678]  I'm not going to say over the show what I'm doing right now, but, uh, you know, I'm, I'm not taking this lying down.
[01:23:33.718 --> 01:23:35.219]  This is extremely serious.
[01:23:35.779 --> 01:23:40.601]  It's heartbreaking truly to me that someone would accuse me.
[01:23:40.901 --> 01:23:43.302]  Cause like I said, it's like accusing my family.
[01:23:43.362 --> 01:23:45.863]  My mother and father taught me and they taught me well.
[01:23:46.949 --> 01:23:50.452]  And, you know, everyone in my family's a veteran.
[01:23:50.472 --> 01:23:58.657]  And anyone who knows me, the guys that served with me, why don't they talk to some of them and ask them how I was?
[01:23:58.837 --> 01:24:01.139]  Talk to my Master Chief, Terry Mother Moy.
[01:24:01.923 --> 01:24:06.266]  You know, and ask him, would I say anything like this?
[01:24:06.306 --> 01:24:13.031]  This is absurd, and it can be easily counteracted if I was up in the states.
[01:24:13.131 --> 01:24:15.833]  But again, like you said, Alex, how timely.
[01:24:16.954 --> 01:24:27.701]  Obviously, I must be under some type of surveillance for people to know exactly when I would cross the border and have no means to communicate or to fight for myself, and it would give them the time
[01:24:28.662 --> 01:24:37.749]  To sink this story in across the airwaves and then of course fiction becomes fact, I guess, many times.
[01:24:37.789 --> 01:24:39.050]  You know, the damage is done.
[01:24:39.070 --> 01:24:41.091]  I can't do anything about that.
[01:24:41.531 --> 01:24:53.280]  But you can bet that I will seek a full retraction of this and I'll tell you if anyone wants on your show, I demand a retraction because what this person is saying is unequivocally untrue.
[01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:57.103]  If I would have said those things, he would have hit me.
[01:24:57.743 --> 01:25:02.827]  But he never hit me, so clearly, Alex, I did not say those things.
[01:25:04.849 --> 01:25:16.899]  If this Kyle individual, this Chris Kyle, was standing in front of you, who wants to make his big name off of trying to destroy your honor, if he was standing in front of you right now, what would you say to him?
[01:25:16.919 --> 01:25:18.260]  Because undoubtedly he's going to watch this.
[01:25:21.028 --> 01:25:27.849]  I would simply ask him why he would lie about committing a crime against me.
[01:25:28.709 --> 01:25:36.431]  Why would he go on national TV and lie about assaulting me, which is a crime, and admit that he did it?
[01:25:38.851 --> 01:25:39.271]  What'd you say?
[01:25:40.531 --> 01:25:42.912]  And admit that he did it if he said he did.
[01:25:43.552 --> 01:25:48.713]  And I know I'd look at him and smile and go, you've never hit me in your life.
[01:25:50.885 --> 01:25:54.830]  Well, it's incredibly... I mean, it's incredibly cowardly.
[01:25:54.850 --> 01:26:02.399]  You know, I've done a lot of interviews with you, Governor, and been on your TV show for three seasons now, and I've met your wife, great lady.
[01:26:02.780 --> 01:26:04.903]  I know she's been in the background before during interviews.
[01:26:05.183 --> 01:26:06.645]  I've never heard her jumping in.
[01:26:06.925 --> 01:26:08.587]  Sounds like Terry's pretty upset.
[01:26:08.607 --> 01:26:09.629]  What's your wife think of this?
[01:26:11.773 --> 01:26:13.434]  No, of course she is.
[01:26:13.494 --> 01:26:15.175]  We've been married 36 years.
[01:26:15.235 --> 01:26:18.277]  She knows me better than any other person on the planet does.
[01:26:18.377 --> 01:26:23.500]  And like any couple, when one couple is hurt, the other feels the pain also.
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:27.162]  Anyone that's ever been in love and had a wife knows that.
[01:26:27.782 --> 01:26:30.103]  And so, sure, she's feeling my pain.
[01:26:30.644 --> 01:26:33.205]  She's feeling it with me, as she always has.
[01:26:33.245 --> 01:26:35.687]  But there's not a more loyal person in the world.
[01:26:37.087 --> 01:26:44.073]  Then her, and I know I always have her support 100%, and she certainly, she has been out there with me.
[01:26:44.673 --> 01:26:46.615]  My wife has been to McP's.
[01:26:47.555 --> 01:26:51.939]  She knows that nothing like that would ever happen, or she would know about it.
[01:26:52.984 --> 01:26:56.346]  She's friends with many of my SEAL Team teammates.
[01:26:57.947 --> 01:26:59.427]  I challenge this, Alex.
[01:26:59.968 --> 01:27:08.032]  I challenge the SEAL community for anyone else who knows of this event to come forward because no one will.
[01:27:08.572 --> 01:27:13.555]  And if they do, they're being untruthful because it did not happen unequivocally.
[01:27:14.015 --> 01:27:15.496]  This guy never hit me.
[01:27:15.976 --> 01:27:16.976]  I don't even know him.
[01:27:17.777 --> 01:27:21.699]  If he walked into the room right now, Alex, I wouldn't know who he was.
[01:27:23.803 --> 01:27:29.846]  Well, when the truth comes out, he's going to be known as basically a Benedict Arnold.
[01:27:30.206 --> 01:27:45.735]  Next to the word defamation in the dictionary is going to be a picture of this guy because I cannot imagine anything more dishonorable than to be part of a community, an elite community of people that serve their country and then to concoct
[01:27:46.215 --> 01:28:01.768]  Such a horrible lie, and then to try to bring so much pain to Navy SEALs and their families that have lost or been wounded, and to try to blame it all on you, it is beyond sickening and disgusting and cowardly.
[01:28:01.788 --> 01:28:08.433]  And that's why when I heard this and saw this and registered the body language, I went and did research on this guy and a chill went up my spine.
[01:28:08.733 --> 01:28:10.755]  The Richard Perle, Dick Cheney connections.
[01:28:11.916 --> 01:28:15.978]  He's an Eric Prince, Blackwater wannabe, setting this thing up in Dallas.
[01:28:16.439 --> 01:28:18.660]  I thought, oh my god, they put him up to this.
[01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:23.424]  And I got nauseous, nauseous by Friday.
[01:28:23.604 --> 01:28:26.286]  I knew this was going to be pure bull, Jesse.
[01:28:26.306 --> 01:28:29.468]  And I just cannot believe it.
[01:28:29.508 --> 01:28:30.609]  Look, they're scared of you.
[01:28:30.929 --> 01:28:32.470]  You ought to be proud they're doing this.
[01:28:32.850 --> 01:28:36.873]  They want to destroy you politically, even though you weren't intending to run.
[01:28:38.414 --> 01:28:41.116]  And I, you know, I wrote an article yesterday about this with Paul Watson.
[01:28:41.156 --> 01:28:43.718]  I said this may have the opposite effect.
[01:28:44.258 --> 01:28:59.649]  We're gonna go to break and come back and finish up with the interview, but somebody's got to stand up against these lies because if they can pick us off one by one, I mean what are they gonna claim next week that I was murdering penguins at the North Pole or that I work with Hitler?
[01:29:02.287 --> 01:29:03.769]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:29:03.989 --> 01:29:09.014]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:29:09.294 --> 01:29:10.655]  Saving means to make money.
[01:29:10.836 --> 01:29:19.624]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:29:20.345 --> 01:29:27.450]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:29:27.890 --> 01:29:35.495]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:29:35.895 --> 01:29:40.818]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:29:41.118 --> 01:29:43.279]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[01:30:00.916 --> 01:30:02.177]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:02.237 --> 01:30:07.582]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:30:07.822 --> 01:30:12.446]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:30:12.827 --> 01:30:17.911]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:30:18.412 --> 01:30:23.096]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:30:23.616 --> 01:30:30.541]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:30:30.741 --> 01:30:31.642]  And here's the best part.
[01:30:31.862 --> 01:30:38.226]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:30:38.546 --> 01:30:41.388]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:30:41.728 --> 01:30:44.811]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:30:49.894 --> 01:30:52.216]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:30:52.757 --> 01:30:57.280]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:30:57.580 --> 01:31:00.042]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:31:01.524 --> 01:31:15.955]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:20.690]  My name is Mario Cifaldi, and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:21.693 --> 01:31:25.763]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[01:31:26.351 --> 01:31:33.674]  It also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your Silver Solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:31:34.434 --> 01:31:41.737]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:31:42.398 --> 01:31:51.962]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lung System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lung System works.
[01:31:52.762 --> 01:31:56.023]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:31:56.683 --> 01:31:59.864]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:32:00.544 --> 01:32:04.365]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are, a decade into the 21st century?
[01:32:04.685 --> 01:32:08.446]  Record foreclosure rates for homes, if not yours, your neighbor's.
[01:32:08.826 --> 01:32:18.289]  Thankful for the unemployment checks since you were laid off, and placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.

[01:33:02.099 --> 01:33:04.964]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[01:33:05.706 --> 01:33:08.912]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:16.798 --> 01:33:32.997]  Alright, here is another 10 minutes of this interview and we've got a whole other segment of it with Governor Jesse Ventura breaking down the attempt to assassinate his character to defame him because he exposes the New World Order, because he's a prominent person who won't lie down.
[01:33:33.718 --> 01:33:35.660]  It gets even more powerful right here.
[01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:36.100]  Here it is.
[01:33:37.062 --> 01:33:38.623]  You ought to be proud they're doing this.
[01:33:38.983 --> 01:33:43.026]  They want to destroy you politically, even though you weren't intending to run.
[01:33:43.046 --> 01:33:47.269]  And I, you know, I wrote an article yesterday about this with Paul Watson.
[01:33:47.309 --> 01:33:48.790]  I said this may have the opposite effect.
[01:33:49.050 --> 01:33:59.296]  If they think this is going to run you off and make you go into the sunset, this may pull you out of the sunset, Jesse, because I know you've been veering towards going off into the sunset.
[01:34:02.058 --> 01:34:04.400]  Well, only to serve, Alex, you know.
[01:34:04.420 --> 01:34:06.401]  But again, on a serious note,
[01:34:07.330 --> 01:34:16.352]  For him to make allegations that I would take any joy in a United States military person dying in a war, I don't.
[01:34:17.613 --> 01:34:24.195]  And when you ask me what I would say to him if I saw him face-to-face, I would say, how dare you?
[01:34:24.215 --> 01:34:32.877]  I can be against a war, but I have never, ever been against the poor soldiers, sailors, and airmen that have to fight it.
[01:34:33.695 --> 01:34:35.996]  Regardless of which war that is.
[01:34:36.016 --> 01:34:43.479]  And I've lived through a lot of them, Alex, because it's 30 years now of my life that my country has been at war.
[01:34:44.219 --> 01:34:48.641]  And I'm sick of war, and I'll say it to anybody, I despise war.
[01:34:49.121 --> 01:34:51.482]  War is the failure of politicians.
[01:34:52.103 --> 01:34:57.485]  Their ultimate failure is the ultimate, ultimately why you have war.
[01:34:58.085 --> 01:35:02.407]  But I would never, ever say anything to hurt any
[01:35:03.147 --> 01:35:06.169]  Soldier, sailor, airman, because they did their job.
[01:35:07.229 --> 01:35:08.970]  Is that strong enough, Alex?
[01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:10.371]  It's strong, Governor.
[01:35:11.752 --> 01:35:19.176]  I just wonder what they're thinking, because Fox News and others have really opened themselves up, repeatedly stating this like it's a fact.
[01:35:19.516 --> 01:35:20.556]  They never say claim.
[01:35:20.596 --> 01:35:26.940]  They say, but again, knocking you out, that's to make you defame you as a tough guy, as you're known to be.
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:29.861]  But that's nothing in my view, as you've agreed.
[01:35:31.622 --> 01:35:43.477]  I mean, they've got to know that you're obviously going to come after them, and it's just, it's mind-blowing that they, before Fox went with this, before others did, that they didn't call McPease and find out that this was total bull.
[01:35:45.948 --> 01:36:00.813]  Well, it is total bull because, you know, Doc McPartland, like I said, I've known him, he was one of my instructors after I completed BUDZ and I went to what they call SBI, SEAL Basic Indoctrination, and I see the doc all the time when I'm down there.
[01:36:00.833 --> 01:36:11.716]  I always ask him how business is going and if this event would have happened in his bar five and a half years ago, or his, it's a bar eating establishment both,
[01:36:12.436 --> 01:36:17.120]  If this would have happened, this would have been on the news five and a half years ago.
[01:36:17.140 --> 01:36:23.486]  How does it suddenly rear its head five and a half years later because it's not true?
[01:36:23.506 --> 01:36:24.987]  It did not happen.
[01:36:25.823 --> 01:36:27.565]  Nobody's ever hit me there.
[01:36:28.205 --> 01:36:29.706]  Nothing like that has happened.
[01:36:29.786 --> 01:36:38.653]  And, you know, I'll be interested to see what witnesses can possibly come forward to this event because you can't have a witness to an event that didn't happen.
[01:36:39.053 --> 01:36:39.574]  That's right.
[01:36:39.914 --> 01:36:44.197]  And Fox and all the other channels always just take clips of interviews from my show without asking.
[01:36:44.237 --> 01:36:48.281]  But I'm here giving them permission if they want to try to begin to set things right.
[01:36:48.341 --> 01:36:49.762]  Not that that's possible.
[01:36:50.242 --> 01:36:51.663]  But I mean, they're basically on notice.
[01:36:51.683 --> 01:36:52.664]  You better retract.
[01:36:52.744 --> 01:36:53.865]  And knowing them, they don't care.
[01:36:53.885 --> 01:36:56.627]  I mean, look at News Corp with what they've been caught doing in England.
[01:36:57.048 --> 01:36:59.690]  Spying, bribing, wiretapping people.
[01:37:00.531 --> 01:37:06.596]  They have the New York Post, you know, do similar things before that they did have to retract on 9-11 truth groups.
[01:37:07.236 --> 01:37:08.797]  And they just don't care.
[01:37:08.857 --> 01:37:15.400]  They've got a mission because they know they're getting ready to start a new war and they want to try to discredit you ahead of that.
[01:37:15.460 --> 01:37:17.782]  They hate the fact that you are UDT Navy SEAL.
[01:37:18.062 --> 01:37:24.225]  They hate the fact that you're a popular movie star, wrestler, governor, mayor, best-selling author.
[01:37:24.865 --> 01:37:29.147]  Alex, let me interject for a moment on McPease.
[01:37:29.708 --> 01:37:34.070]  McPease would never let me back in if I would have said those
[01:37:35.732 --> 01:37:36.754]  I can tell you that.
[01:37:36.894 --> 01:37:43.784]  Doc McPartland would never even let me set my foot in there if I would have stated what this guy said I said.
[01:37:47.125 --> 01:37:49.106]  Well, they're trying to turn the wholesale community against you.
[01:37:49.126 --> 01:38:03.929]  I think this is just a... Look, you called into my show first, then you were on the local TV and newspapers the next day with retractions, when they said you were tailgating like a maniac in California getting to the airport, and I just talked to you the day before to get you on the radio show the next week.
[01:38:04.449 --> 01:38:05.330]  You were in Minnesota.
[01:38:05.390 --> 01:38:06.370]  I called your Minnesota... I mean...
[01:38:06.830 --> 01:38:11.052]  You haven't flown in 16 months because of the TSA groping you.
[01:38:11.092 --> 01:38:12.633]  It's all over the news, you're suing them.
[01:38:13.153 --> 01:38:32.401]  All of this is going on, and they have TMZ hooked up with Fox, come out and say that you're this maniac, and then they remove the article but don't retract when your lawyer calls them, and now they do this again with this guy rolling out of... I think this guy's a useful idiot that the insiders contacted and talked into doing this.
[01:38:33.041 --> 01:38:38.208]  I mean, that's clearly what happened here, and I don't, he doesn't seem like he's that smart, and I think he's gonna get in a lot of trouble.
[01:38:40.991 --> 01:38:41.973]  Well, I don't know.
[01:38:42.093 --> 01:38:43.315]  I, you know, like I said...
[01:38:45.145 --> 01:38:50.786]  I'm going to do what I need to do to clear this matter up.
[01:38:50.846 --> 01:38:53.807]  I won't rest on just simply talking to you.
[01:38:53.967 --> 01:38:59.468]  I will pursue other avenues, but it's difficult for me because of the timing.
[01:38:59.528 --> 01:39:09.150]  I'm way down here in Mexico right now, and I don't have access to get on television and deny these charges unless I drive all the way back up.
[01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:11.911]  That's a two-day drive that's very brutal.
[01:39:13.672 --> 01:39:23.357]  The timing of this is also very remarkable, Alex, and it's amazing that, you know, but I thank you, because just keep, in fact, I have to ask you, Alex, help.
[01:39:24.097 --> 01:39:25.518]  You're my man right now.
[01:39:25.578 --> 01:39:26.679]  You're my media guy.
[01:39:26.699 --> 01:39:33.883]  You're the only guy I have access to talk to, so it's going to fall on your shoulders, my friend, to clear my name here immediately.
[01:39:34.083 --> 01:39:35.204]  Well, we all know what happened.
[01:39:35.244 --> 01:39:35.664]  You bet.
[01:39:35.764 --> 01:39:39.366]  I'm the one, it was my crew showed it to me a few hours after it happened.
[01:39:39.386 --> 01:39:41.808]  That was on Wednesday, and I said, this is going to
[01:39:42.888 --> 01:39:43.669]  No, that was Thursday.
[01:39:43.689 --> 01:39:45.429]  I said, this is going to get really, really big.
[01:39:46.150 --> 01:39:49.351]  And by Friday, it was all over the TV stations.
[01:39:49.992 --> 01:39:56.915]  And I just kept, you know, telling Ty, it was trying to every five minutes, try to get your dad that, you know, obviously this isn't true, but we got to get a response.
[01:39:57.515 --> 01:40:00.097]  And now they, I'm sure they think it's real funny what they've done.
[01:40:00.117 --> 01:40:02.218]  And I know, you know, you've been working really hard.
[01:40:02.238 --> 01:40:07.480]  You deserve a vacation, but I'm afraid you're going to probably have to get back in the RV and drive up to California.
[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:08.321]  But here's the problem.
[01:40:08.661 --> 01:40:12.303]  You know in the last five years when you went on CNN, Fox, you cleaned their clocks.
[01:40:12.703 --> 01:40:14.524]  So now they don't have you on as often.
[01:40:15.105 --> 01:40:20.568]  And I think they're probably going to try to close the doors on you so they can just get away with all this.
[01:40:20.588 --> 01:40:23.930]  But they're not going to be able to ignore, obviously, what comes out of it later.
[01:40:24.830 --> 01:40:27.112]  But that's just what Rupert Murdoch does.
[01:40:27.152 --> 01:40:27.992]  But I think you're right.
[01:40:28.032 --> 01:40:32.295]  Your initial point that this is News Corp doing this, this is their specialty.
[01:40:32.335 --> 01:40:37.418]  And so you ought to, I mean, it's the mark of the fact that you're a patriot and that you'll talk about 9-11 being an incident.
[01:40:37.978 --> 01:40:39.599]  Yeah, having evidence of inside job.
[01:40:39.839 --> 01:40:42.881]  You'll talk about Kennedy being assassinated by the government or elements of it.
[01:40:43.182 --> 01:40:45.223]  You'll talk about the wars being frauds.
[01:40:45.763 --> 01:40:51.227]  You'll talk about all this so they need to try to destroy you ahead of this big police state.
[01:40:51.247 --> 01:40:55.790]  You've been criticizing their NDAA, their TSA, the checkpoints on the highways.
[01:40:57.251 --> 01:41:01.634]  They're putting out fake ads saying that Ron Paul put them out.
[01:41:02.114 --> 01:41:07.295]  Being racist towards Asians, and then it turned out it was tracked back to Huntsman's people.
[01:41:07.916 --> 01:41:10.136]  But the media now won't retract it.
[01:41:10.536 --> 01:41:18.379]  I mean, listen, they've got people dressed up as racist hayseeds, claiming that they support Rand Paul and Ron Paul in getting caught.
[01:41:19.219 --> 01:41:20.959]  Governor, I think you're going to see more dirty tricks.
[01:41:21.279 --> 01:41:23.440]  I mean, because you're over the target.
[01:41:25.689 --> 01:41:27.569]  Well, maybe so, Alex.
[01:41:27.589 --> 01:41:29.490]  There's nothing I can do about that.
[01:41:29.530 --> 01:41:30.630]  I'm going to be who I am.
[01:41:30.710 --> 01:41:36.871]  I'm going to continue to speak out on everything because I believe in our Constitution.
[01:41:36.951 --> 01:41:38.232]  I believe in our Bill of Rights.
[01:41:38.872 --> 01:41:49.514]  And I believe that right in the crosshairs right now, if the country doesn't rise up and protect citizens and our Constitution and Bill of Rights, that we're going to lose our country.
[01:41:50.634 --> 01:41:58.878]  I truly believe that because everything that I'm learning and the more I get into it and see what's going on, the more we have to be that much more vigilant.
[01:41:59.359 --> 01:42:04.861]  And as I said, I got to count on you now, Alex, because right now my hands are tied down here.
[01:42:04.881 --> 01:42:06.042]  I don't have the ability to.
[01:42:07.343 --> 01:42:15.531]  Although, if it could be set up that I could do television somewhere, I would be happy to go, you know, on satellite and go on any one of these shows.
[01:42:15.611 --> 01:42:27.223]  So, if you're in contact with Fox, who appears to be out to destroy me, tell them I'll be available anytime I possibly can, but because of the remoteness of where I live, it's difficult.
[01:42:27.623 --> 01:42:31.565]  Yeah, you may have to drive into some major Mexican city too and probably do an uplink there.
[01:42:32.346 --> 01:42:37.348]  Well, I just can't believe they, I mean, I guess they've already destroyed their credibility so many times.
[01:42:37.989 --> 01:42:40.910]  They don't care about doing this again and again.
[01:42:42.878 --> 01:42:51.161]  We're going to come back and finish up the rest of it, but you've heard it in mainstream corporate horror media that reports about WMDs in Iraq and Easter bunnies in your closet.
[01:42:52.041 --> 01:42:55.622]  You want to have Ventura actually talk about this, that Fox has made this big story?
[01:42:56.062 --> 01:42:56.682]  Here he is.
[01:42:56.702 --> 01:42:58.303]  Man, here comes the lawsuits, too.
[01:43:01.641 --> 01:43:07.064]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:43:08.305 --> 01:43:13.067]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:43:13.448 --> 01:43:20.211]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:43:22.172 --> 01:43:24.454]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:43:26.235 --> 01:43:28.196]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:43:30.663 --> 01:43:34.526]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:43:35.246 --> 01:43:38.368]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[01:43:39.088 --> 01:43:39.909]  Others don't.
[01:43:40.309 --> 01:43:42.190]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:43:42.471 --> 01:43:43.972]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[01:43:44.252 --> 01:43:46.813]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:43:47.134 --> 01:43:53.398]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:43:53.758 --> 01:43:55.959]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:43:56.460 --> 01:43:58.501]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[01:43:58.841 --> 01:43:59.702]  Others don't.
[01:44:05.109 --> 01:44:06.029]  Tyranny is here.
[01:44:06.370 --> 01:44:10.291]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:44:10.311 --> 01:44:12.512]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:44:12.532 --> 01:44:17.975]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:44:18.415 --> 01:44:24.658]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:44:25.058 --> 01:44:30.621]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:44:31.061 --> 01:44:34.703]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:44:35.223 --> 01:44:39.225]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:44:39.506 --> 01:44:45.068]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:44:45.449 --> 01:44:48.430]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:44:49.011 --> 01:44:50.431]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:44:50.992 --> 01:44:51.412]  It's here.

[01:45:01.898 --> 01:45:03.399]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:45:03.620 --> 01:45:08.663]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:45:08.923 --> 01:45:10.284]  Saving means to make money.

[01:47:38.041 --> 01:47:42.424]  Alright, we're going to get to most of the interview, but we'll air the rest of it tomorrow, 11am.
[01:47:42.905 --> 01:47:52.551]  But I brought up this guy that told these fairy tales, and I asked Governor Ventura, wouldn't it be best for him to go ahead and go public now, before he's under oath?
[01:47:52.611 --> 01:47:53.131]  Here it is.
[01:47:54.632 --> 01:47:58.375]  Yeah, I agree totally that it would be in his best interest to tell the truth.
[01:47:59.614 --> 01:48:00.195]  Absolutely.
[01:48:00.235 --> 01:48:07.945]  That this thing never happened and that it's all fabricated because the longer it goes on, the worse and worse it's going to be.
[01:48:07.965 --> 01:48:09.166]  Wow.
[01:48:09.587 --> 01:48:11.069]  Well, Governor, thank you so much.
[01:48:11.489 --> 01:48:13.952]  You've got our hotline numbers here throughout the week.
[01:48:14.093 --> 01:48:15.655]  Anytime you've got points you want to make.
[01:48:16.435 --> 01:48:20.718]  And I know you're down there to exercise and take a few months off before you come back.
[01:48:20.778 --> 01:48:25.502]  And I know you're down there writing another book that's coming out later this year.
[01:48:25.782 --> 01:48:26.683]  But what a way to start 2012.
[01:48:26.823 --> 01:48:30.525]  I mean, something similar happened to me.
[01:48:30.545 --> 01:48:38.791]  And you know it's staged when suddenly it's all over the Dallas Morning News, Denver Post, national TV, within minutes, you know, extras calling you.
[01:48:39.151 --> 01:48:40.772]  But I was out there protesting.
[01:48:41.893 --> 01:48:42.674]  I don't think so.
[01:49:02.455 --> 01:49:11.202]  And then the headlines were out within hours that I was saying kill Michelle Malkin leading a mob, and I had people saying your career is over, you're saying kill women.
[01:49:11.522 --> 01:49:13.764]  Thank God we were able to upload video.
[01:49:14.104 --> 01:49:19.748]  I threatened to sue a bunch of people, and all retracted with the Dallas Morning News, but that was enough to discredit them.
[01:49:20.129 --> 01:49:22.811]  And they tried to say I was saying kill a woman, Gov.
[01:49:23.111 --> 01:49:24.992]  So I've had them do similar stuff.
[01:49:26.954 --> 01:49:28.455]  Let me just say this, Alex.
[01:49:28.575 --> 01:49:29.356]  I won't threaten.
[01:49:35.677 --> 01:49:37.198]  Well, it's just amazing.
[01:49:37.238 --> 01:49:41.621]  If you get what I just said to you, I won't threaten it.
[01:49:44.943 --> 01:49:47.245]  You sound pretty mad at Chris Kyle.
[01:49:49.577 --> 01:49:53.038]  Well, I didn't even know his name until you told it to me today.
[01:49:53.058 --> 01:49:56.198]  That shows you how distant this whole thing is.
[01:49:56.258 --> 01:49:57.419]  I don't even know who he is.
[01:49:57.439 --> 01:50:00.859]  I have no idea if I've ever met him.
[01:50:01.419 --> 01:50:06.621]  Because, you know, when I go out there, you meet many other SEALs that weren't of your era.
[01:50:07.201 --> 01:50:08.421]  And, you know, hi, how you doing?
[01:50:08.441 --> 01:50:10.361]  You shake hands or whatever it might be.
[01:50:10.381 --> 01:50:12.262]  Or they come up to you.
[01:50:12.282 --> 01:50:18.303]  Because I know for many times I was there always with Rudy Bosch, you know, Chief Bosch from Survivor.
[01:50:19.403 --> 01:50:46.135]  We would be so inundated with picture-taking that we would sit and laugh and Rudy and I would say you know we need to get those cardboard cutouts so everyone can stand next to us and get their picture taken and that way we can go over enjoy and have fun because it would take it you know at that point Rudy was red-hot because he was the original Survivor Show and all that and so that would go on so there has never been a time at any seal event that I've gone
[01:50:46.175 --> 01:50:46.375]  I don't.
[01:51:03.063 --> 01:51:12.649]  But we know, because I've seen you with troops and had you on my show 50 times and seen in other shows, you always say, my heart goes out to those dying because of these lying politicians.
[01:51:12.709 --> 01:51:13.690]  It's so horrible.
[01:51:14.010 --> 01:51:16.171]  I mean, you would never say something like that.
[01:51:16.512 --> 01:51:19.333]  I've seen you talk about your mom and dad and get a tear in your eye.
[01:51:19.594 --> 01:51:22.956]  I mean, that is such a load of venomous garbage.
[01:51:23.696 --> 01:51:45.768]  And I want to close with a quote here of an advisor to Fox News, and one of their main political correspondents, in an interview with the New York Times Magazine, October 17, 2004, when Karl Rove said, in what we call the reality-based community, which he defined as people who believe the solutions emerge from a judicious study of discernible reality, that quote,
[01:51:46.468 --> 01:51:49.349]  That's not the way the world really works anymore, he continued.
[01:51:49.690 --> 01:51:52.771]  We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality.
[01:51:53.111 --> 01:52:02.056]  And while you're studying that reality judiciously, as you will, we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out.
[01:52:02.416 --> 01:52:07.538]  We're history's actors, and you, all of you, will be left just to study what we do.
[01:52:07.798 --> 01:52:10.800]  My dad last night was over for dinner, and he said this reeks
[01:52:11.500 --> 01:52:14.221]  Of Karl Rove, who lives here in Austin, by the way.
[01:52:14.841 --> 01:52:27.907]  And regardless, they think they can just tell the public something and that makes it reality, like Obama saying dropping bombs all over Libya is not a military action, but is a kinetic action.
[01:52:28.867 --> 01:52:33.809]  They think just because they roll some punk out to say something, that makes it true, Governor.
[01:52:36.013 --> 01:52:37.514]  Well, absolutely.
[01:52:37.574 --> 01:52:38.814]  And it doesn't make it true.
[01:52:38.894 --> 01:52:45.517]  And when I come back and get back up there, in fact, before I get there, you know, the ball will be rolling.
[01:52:45.537 --> 01:52:50.820]  You know, I'm doing what I can do to clear my name and I'll do whatever it takes to do that because
[01:52:51.740 --> 01:52:58.904]  Uh, you know, I'm the kind of guy, Alex, I'll be happy to admit when I do something, but I don't want to be credited with things that I don't do.
[01:52:59.625 --> 01:53:03.687]  And I would think this guy wouldn't want to be credited also with assaulting me.
[01:53:03.747 --> 01:53:04.768]  You know, he never did it.
[01:53:04.788 --> 01:53:06.389]  It never happened.
[01:53:06.789 --> 01:53:07.349]  And why?
[01:53:08.370 --> 01:53:12.132]  Somebody needs to ask him why he's telling this story because it's not true.
[01:53:12.532 --> 01:53:22.860]  Well, I tell you, Gov, this is going to boomerang on them, because they crafted the most vicious lie they could and sold it as if it was absolute truth from the beginning, because they are concerned about you.
[01:53:23.201 --> 01:53:27.104]  They are scared of you with a third-party run, or if somebody picks you for a VP.
[01:53:27.124 --> 01:53:29.986]  They know you've been talking behind the scenes some to the libertarians.
[01:53:31.067 --> 01:53:40.955]  And they're concerned, so they put something out saying you were glad that Navy SEALs were dead in front of their family, the most sickening thing you could say to military people.
[01:53:42.356 --> 01:53:45.197]  When they made their move on you, they did it when you were out of the country.
[01:53:45.577 --> 01:53:47.777]  They forged the most wicked lie they could.
[01:53:47.797 --> 01:53:51.698]  And you say you will defend yourself.
[01:53:51.738 --> 01:53:52.438]  You're not stupid.
[01:53:52.698 --> 01:53:53.359]  You've got to.
[01:53:53.419 --> 01:54:00.680]  You're not going to probably, the way they're hyping it, do very well from this unless you absolutely go after these people.
[01:54:00.720 --> 01:54:01.400]  And you know that.
[01:54:01.761 --> 01:54:07.802]  And so God knows what's coming next if they're going to move with something this dangerous.
[01:54:09.918 --> 01:54:12.880]  Yeah, I don't know Alex, but I'll be on my toes.
[01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:15.622]  I have to admit though, this one caught me off guard.
[01:54:16.262 --> 01:54:19.084]  I never expected to be hit with what they hit me with.
[01:54:27.330 --> 01:54:31.594]  You know, being an expert on the JFK assassination and covering it in your hit TV show for TruTV.
[01:54:32.274 --> 01:54:36.077]  And people can read your statements, by the way, at TheRealJesseVentura on Facebook.
[01:54:36.097 --> 01:54:38.679]  We're linked to the statement at InfoWars.com.
[01:54:38.699 --> 01:54:39.840]  The article is exclusive.
[01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:44.244]  Jesse Ventura blasts Navy SEAL punch hoax as a total lie.
[01:54:47.046 --> 01:54:59.801]  You know, you talked about, but in your own words, and I know you've got to go, that this is like them mailing a rifle, the Carcano, from Chicago to Dallas when you could buy a gun anywhere with no registration in 1963.
[01:54:59.921 --> 01:55:05.928]  You said, what, are they going to start mailing guns from Chicago to you down in Baja, Mexico?
[01:55:08.931 --> 01:55:21.145]  I don't know, but always remember, Alex, they said that Oswald was in Mexico while they also said he was at a shooting range, and so I'm getting accused of doing all these things.
[01:55:21.625 --> 01:55:23.347]  Do you think there's a double of me?
[01:55:23.367 --> 01:55:25.870]  You know, there's that famous book, Lee and Harvey.
[01:55:26.150 --> 01:55:28.073]  I believe Armstrong is the author.
[01:55:28.863 --> 01:55:32.805]  Do you think that they have a double of me out there that's causing all this trouble?
[01:55:34.106 --> 01:55:34.626]  You know what?
[01:55:34.686 --> 01:55:36.467]  That is the exact kind of stuff they do.
[01:55:36.507 --> 01:55:37.628]  You know what they did to Garrison?
[01:55:37.948 --> 01:55:43.611]  He'd be in an airport and walk in the bathroom and men would start trying to grab on him and there'd be police waiting right there.
[01:55:44.071 --> 01:55:47.954]  I mean, look, look, they're doing a whole bunch of this stuff to Ron Paul, too, right now.
[01:55:48.735 --> 01:55:52.798]  Again, they put out a fake video saying it was his, making fun of Asians.
[01:55:52.898 --> 01:55:54.400]  Fox, CNN, all took it.
[01:55:54.740 --> 01:55:58.943]  And it turns out now it goes back to one of the people he's running against.
[01:55:59.004 --> 01:56:00.405]  And they're even bragging about it.
[01:56:00.705 --> 01:56:02.466]  That's how dumb they think the public is.
[01:56:02.506 --> 01:56:05.349]  So, pray for Jesse Ventura, pray for Ron Paul, pray for me.
[01:56:06.109 --> 01:56:10.293]  Because folks, you know, we're not perfect, but we're not under the globalist insider's control.
[01:56:10.613 --> 01:56:13.155]  And that's why we're wildcards, we're loose cannons.
[01:56:13.495 --> 01:56:14.716]  The system is scared of us.
[01:56:14.736 --> 01:56:16.338]  Governor, thank you so much.
[01:56:16.718 --> 01:56:19.180]  Okay, one last thing, Alex.
[01:56:19.300 --> 01:56:20.000]  One last thing.
[01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:21.782]  I want to stay on your show first.
[01:56:22.657 --> 01:56:24.779]  My wife and I are not suicidal.
[01:56:24.899 --> 01:56:25.960]  We're in great health.
[01:56:26.361 --> 01:56:27.722]  We're good drivers.
[01:56:28.442 --> 01:56:31.225]  And we don't have Twitter.
[01:56:31.685 --> 01:56:37.471]  So anybody that says that I've Twittered anything, you know as well as I do, I don't own a cell phone.
[01:56:38.011 --> 01:56:43.155]  And you gotta own a cell phone to Twitter, so anything done on Twitter is also false.
[01:56:43.515 --> 01:56:48.618]  But again, Alex, we're not suicidal, we're in good health, and we're very good drivers.
[01:56:48.658 --> 01:56:53.642]  Well, you and your wife are very smart, so I wanted to tell you something you don't know, but for some of the new audience may not understand.
[01:56:54.082 --> 01:56:55.543]  I told Ty the same thing off-air.
[01:56:55.563 --> 01:57:03.088]  I said, you know, sometimes they do a really bad demonization, and then they kill you so that you can't defend yourself.
[01:57:03.108 --> 01:57:04.729]  So I'm glad you got this out here.
[01:57:05.169 --> 01:57:08.990]  And please, viewers and listeners, make sure you get this out to everybody.
[01:57:09.450 --> 01:57:11.090]  To everybody out there.
[01:57:12.571 --> 01:57:17.472]  Because if they can destroy Jesse, folks, we've got to stand together or hang separate, as Ben Franklin said.
[01:57:17.792 --> 01:57:21.973]  That's why we've got to stand with Governor Ventura against this outrageous lie.
[01:57:22.293 --> 01:57:26.513]  Because they'll get away with it with Ron Paul, or anybody else that comes out in the future.
[01:57:26.734 --> 01:57:29.874]  We've got to stand with Governor Ventura right now.
[01:57:29.954 --> 01:57:33.655]  I mean, look at how they shut down that episode on the police state FEMA camps.
[01:57:33.936 --> 01:57:34.977]  That's most of the interview.
[01:57:34.997 --> 01:57:35.798]  I ran out of time.
[01:57:35.818 --> 01:57:37.059]  I'll have a little bit more tomorrow.
[01:57:37.079 --> 01:57:37.940]  11 a.m.
[01:57:37.980 --> 01:57:38.361]  Central.
[01:57:38.401 --> 01:57:39.362]  Great job of the crew.
[01:57:39.903 --> 01:57:43.106]  And again, Jesse came on and said, yes, we must stand together.
[01:57:43.446 --> 01:57:44.327]  They can destroy me.
[01:57:44.367 --> 01:57:45.509]  They can destroy anybody.
[01:57:46.029 --> 01:57:46.890]  God bless you all.
[01:57:46.950 --> 01:57:48.952]  Infowars.com will post the full interview.
[01:57:48.972 --> 01:57:54.118]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
