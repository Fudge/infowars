[00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:06.836]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.497 --> 00:00:08.538]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.278 --> 00:00:10.379]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.841]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.622 --> 00:00:13.523]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.163 --> 00:00:17.787]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.347 --> 00:00:22.412]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:40.093]  We've got another big broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.115]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:42.956 --> 00:00:46.239]  It is Thursday, the fifth day of January 2012.
[00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:51.424]  We're almost through the work week of the first week of the new year.
[00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:53.750]  Before you know it, it'll be 2013.
[00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.732]  All those folks that said it was going to be the end of the world, they're going to look pretty silly.
[00:00:58.752 --> 00:01:01.654]  I hope they turn out to be wrong.
[00:01:02.134 --> 00:01:03.375]  We've got U.S.
[00:01:03.395 --> 00:01:04.535]  troops deploying.
[00:01:04.995 --> 00:01:10.218]  Jerusalem Post is calling it not an exercise, but a deployment to Israel.
[00:01:11.198 --> 00:01:21.704]  And I've got a whole stack of newspaper articles saying it's in preparation for what could be a U.S.-Israel joint strike on Iran.
[00:01:22.788 --> 00:01:37.998]  And Iran, of course, in the last two days, repeatedly has said, if your aircraft carriers come back through the Strait of Hormuz, which is international waters, it's like Saudi Arabia on one side, Iran on the other for a few miles, but it's 12 miles at its shortest point.
[00:01:38.378 --> 00:01:41.020]  It's about, I don't know, eight miles or so through the middle.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.363]  If you come through those waters, you're not going to like what happens.
[00:01:45.383 --> 00:01:46.583]  This is your only warning.
[00:01:47.584 --> 00:01:49.125]  So Iran is, I guess,
[00:01:51.408 --> 00:01:56.850]  Yeah, I'm beginning to realize that it may be a foregone conclusion that they're going to be attacked and or they're crazy.
[00:01:58.231 --> 00:02:01.652]  I mean, I go back to, we ought to re-pull this because I keep mentioning it.
[00:02:02.572 --> 00:02:08.035]  Headline, head of Iranian intelligence says he will take war to streets of Tel Aviv.
[00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:13.877]  And that was press TV, Jerusalem Post, but the official Iranian news agency said that a few months ago.
[00:02:15.342 --> 00:02:31.325]  And when I saw it, it was such a dangerous statement that I had to go and make sure the Iranians actually said it, because the media has exaggerated things and blown things out of proportion on occasion with the Iranians to make the case for war look good.
[00:02:31.465 --> 00:02:33.466]  And he didn't just say he'd attack Tel Aviv.
[00:02:33.506 --> 00:02:36.566]  They said, we'll also take it to the United States and your major cities.
[00:02:37.426 --> 00:02:38.627]  That is asking.
[00:02:39.467 --> 00:02:44.668]  That is begging to have the West attack you.
[00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:55.026]  And then if Iran does activate some type of sleeper cells, that plays right into the government's hands while they implode the economy, while they bring in all this tyranny.
[00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:19.719]  While they set up all these TSA checkpoints that they've tripled the funding for this year, they passed it last year, the NDAA, the arrest of citizens, this whole military-industrial complex takeover is aided massively by a war with Iran and if Iran responds with asymmetrical warfare here in the United States.
[00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.540]  And yes, there is the report.
[00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.121]  Iran threatened street war in Tel Aviv.
[00:03:25.225 --> 00:03:28.608]  Iran has threatened a street war in Tel Aviv and in the U.S.
[00:03:28.748 --> 00:03:31.891]  and Europe should its nuclear sites be targeted.
[00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:32.832]  Please print that for me.
[00:03:32.872 --> 00:03:33.232]  Thank you.
[00:03:34.413 --> 00:03:42.240]  I think that was an Iranian official government news source, but I couldn't read the fine print, so I'll have that after the break once they've printed it for me.
[00:03:46.384 --> 00:03:50.687]  Now, continuing along those lines, we're going to break all this down more after the break.
[00:03:50.828 --> 00:03:52.009]  DHS offers
[00:03:53.781 --> 00:03:59.586]  Officers armed with semi-automatics set up unannounced ID checkpoint.
[00:04:01.728 --> 00:04:02.369]  Did you hear that?
[00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:04.811]  To get into a building.
[00:04:06.153 --> 00:04:16.345]  Uh, and I told you the first beta testing we've seen has been in Massachusetts, New York, Florida, Texas, Arizona, California, now Michigan.
[00:04:16.805 --> 00:04:18.407]  But it's always been in those five states.
[00:04:18.487 --> 00:04:26.075]  For about six years, TSA checkpoints on highways, TSA checkpoints at NFL football games,
[00:04:26.976 --> 00:04:37.504]  High school football games, rock and roll concerts, neighborhoods, and we point to local news reporting and have national media say we were insane it wasn't happening.
[00:04:38.245 --> 00:04:52.156]  Well now the papers in Florida are reporting, and our report is up on Drudge Report right now, DrudgeReport.com, DHS officers armed with semi-automatics set up unannounced ID checkpoint.
[00:04:53.203 --> 00:04:58.587]  This is actually happening, and according to what they've said they're going to do, it's going to be everywhere.
[00:04:59.127 --> 00:04:59.628]  Every building.
[00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:07.313]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:05:08.534 --> 00:05:13.298]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:05:13.678 --> 00:05:20.463]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:05:22.403 --> 00:05:24.566]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:05:26.448 --> 00:05:28.852]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[00:05:30.885 --> 00:05:34.766]  Put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:05:35.466 --> 00:05:38.607]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[00:05:39.307 --> 00:05:40.127]  Others don't.
[00:05:40.547 --> 00:05:42.428]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:05:42.688 --> 00:05:44.208]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[00:05:44.468 --> 00:05:47.029]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:53.610]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.191]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:05:56.691 --> 00:05:58.732]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[00:05:59.052 --> 00:05:59.552]  Others don't.
[00:06:01.087 --> 00:06:05.330]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:06.250]  Number one.
[00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.712]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:09.973 --> 00:06:10.553]  Number two.
[00:06:10.833 --> 00:06:15.396]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:15.736 --> 00:06:16.177]  It's true.
[00:06:16.477 --> 00:06:21.040]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:21.900]  Number three.
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.462]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:25.763 --> 00:06:29.465]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:29.665 --> 00:06:30.206]  Number 4.
[00:06:30.446 --> 00:06:32.828]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:33.208 --> 00:06:36.611]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:36.891 --> 00:06:37.112]  Number 5.
[00:06:37.692 --> 00:06:41.615]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:41.836 --> 00:06:46.600]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.903]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:51.043 --> 00:06:52.605]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:52.845 --> 00:06:54.906]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:06:55.087 --> 00:06:57.428]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:07:02.028 --> 00:07:03.529]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:08.771]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:07:09.051 --> 00:07:10.411]  Saving means to make money.
[00:07:10.591 --> 00:07:19.375]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:07:20.115 --> 00:07:27.222]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:07:27.642 --> 00:07:35.269]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:43.056]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:07:45.819 --> 00:07:48.725]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:07:49.025 --> 00:07:51.250]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.534]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:08:06.345 --> 00:08:10.548]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:12.009]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:13.751]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:14.311 --> 00:08:17.914]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.514 --> 00:08:22.597]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:33.554]  Well, to say that things are heating up in 2012 is another understatement.
[00:08:34.054 --> 00:08:37.497]  The quickening, the climax towards global conflict.
[00:08:38.618 --> 00:08:41.680]  Open world government being established by the big six megabanks.
[00:08:42.601 --> 00:08:44.702]  Open police state dictatorships.
[00:08:45.323 --> 00:08:49.646]  A crackdown on free speech in Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand.
[00:08:49.666 --> 00:08:51.187]  It is all being announced.
[00:08:52.250 --> 00:09:00.855]  The corrupt oppressors, the tyrants, the would-be controllers are attempting a strategy of hiding in plain view.
[00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:08.419]  They're not sneaking around behind the scenes constructing their New World Order and their technological terrors.
[00:09:09.019 --> 00:09:14.762]  They are now openly flaunting them because they're entering a phase of open deployment.
[00:09:15.583 --> 00:09:21.366]  War, checkpoints, military on the streets, political dissidents being arrested.
[00:09:22.543 --> 00:09:27.547]  Now, they are announcing all of this so that people that are intelligent and informed get scared.
[00:09:28.528 --> 00:09:37.315]  If you buy into the fear and stop exercising your free speech and bow to these people, it's over.
[00:09:38.335 --> 00:09:48.483]  The good news is this is so outrageous that even people that work for ABC, Fox, CNN, Comedy Central, The Daily Show,
[00:09:49.588 --> 00:09:55.133]  Are coming out and saying, this is really horrible, Obama is really bad, this is super creepy.
[00:09:55.894 --> 00:10:03.681]  In fact, I forgot to tell the guys, let's play some clips later of that Daily Show that you showed me, Jaren, from Tuesday night, showed to me yesterday.
[00:10:04.997 --> 00:10:10.341]  Where they break down the nuances, the multi-layers of Obama's deception.
[00:10:10.481 --> 00:10:16.606]  You can go watch our breakdown of it hours after he signed it last Saturday night on December 31st.
[00:10:17.226 --> 00:10:19.468]  It's now got over 400,000 views.
[00:10:19.508 --> 00:10:23.531]  It should have 10 million views, but it's titled, Obama Signs Martial Law Bill.
[00:10:23.911 --> 00:10:29.095]  But I have a new video coming out that we'll post in about an hour at InfoWars.com.
[00:10:29.115 --> 00:10:33.078]  We're going to premiere it here for radio slash PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:10:34.918 --> 00:10:40.380]  This detailed full-spectrum analysis of the NDAA that Aaron Dykes and I put together.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:46.362]  Again, Aaron just does a superlative job with these video reports we do.
[00:10:46.922 --> 00:10:51.563]  His videos are undoubtedly the most popular that we put out.
[00:10:52.504 --> 00:10:59.806]  But the entire crew is just excelling with what they're doing, and we are moving to hire some more video editors and more reporters.
[00:11:01.367 --> 00:11:03.728]  And moving more and more people into host positions.
[00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:12.174]  I intend to, once I officially forge the nightly news into the weapon against the globalists, we're smithing it right now.
[00:11:13.315 --> 00:11:16.477]  They're in the Festus or Vulcan volcano.
[00:11:17.158 --> 00:11:19.539]  If you're a new listener, I'm not talking about Vulcans on Star Trek.
[00:11:19.559 --> 00:11:23.022]  You know, the Vulcan is the god, the Roman god of forging weapons.
[00:11:23.742 --> 00:11:25.304]  I guess called Festus by the Greeks.
[00:11:26.044 --> 00:11:33.312]  And just like Jupiter is the Roman name of the Greek god Zeus, but I now digress for the New York Times.
[00:11:34.801 --> 00:11:39.405]  Writes an article saying that I actually believe that we're Vulcans.
[00:11:39.945 --> 00:11:43.248]  The point is, we are forging and beta testing the nightly news.
[00:11:43.668 --> 00:11:57.459]  And when it's done, in the next three, four months, and we start deploying it towards television systems, not just PrisonPlanet.tv, and then when we put it out on the web for millions a week, we will then also start trying to start some other news shows.
[00:11:57.779 --> 00:12:00.001]  Maybe some weekly special reports.
[00:12:00.542 --> 00:12:01.943]  There's a lot we want to do here.
[00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:04.704]  Thanks to your support.
[00:12:07.685 --> 00:12:25.675]  If I sound a bit hesitant from time to time today, I told the story, I guess Tuesday, of how Saturday I was at the gym trying to do high repetition weightlifting to try to lose weight and tone, to really get in the gym and lose some weight.
[00:12:25.835 --> 00:12:27.576]  As you can see, I am losing quite a bit of weight.
[00:12:27.877 --> 00:12:29.798]  It's up to 25 pounds now in the last month and a half.
[00:12:30.878 --> 00:12:41.405]  Uh, and, uh, because I'm, you know, committed to take the radio show to the next level, the TV show to get my health in order, try to get closer to God, you know, everything in 2012 to up our game.
[00:12:42.646 --> 00:12:44.927]  But when you first don't succeed, try, try again.
[00:12:44.947 --> 00:12:51.752]  I was lifting weights and, uh, trying to go for 30 reps with just 120 pounds on incline
[00:12:54.116 --> 00:13:03.498]  And it was tough to get it up on some of those final reps, so I exploded and I guess my hands were tired because it was the last exercise I was doing at the gym.
[00:13:03.518 --> 00:13:10.040]  It was five sets of 20 to 30 reps on the incline, and it just came out of my hands.
[00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:16.261]  And before I could even think to try to catch it, it came out of my hands and fell on my chest.
[00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:19.871]  And I thought, it felt like a horse had kicked me.
[00:13:19.931 --> 00:13:22.092]  I've heard those descriptions of a horse kicking you.
[00:13:22.373 --> 00:13:30.197]  It was probably ten times the pain of, you know, when you're a kid and somebody jumps on your stomach or punches you in the stomach in the bread basket and you can't breathe for 30 seconds.
[00:13:30.737 --> 00:13:31.838]  It was more like a minute and a half.
[00:13:31.878 --> 00:13:32.759]  I thought I was dying.
[00:13:33.219 --> 00:13:40.563]  I got the weight off my chest, went outside, people were kind of looking at me, went out the side door, leaned against the wall, and took about a minute to even be able to get air in.
[00:13:40.583 --> 00:13:41.884]  I was like, am I going to die?
[00:13:41.944 --> 00:13:42.764]  Did I break something?
[00:13:43.125 --> 00:13:43.445]  I was just...
[00:13:44.025 --> 00:14:04.776]  I was like now imagine what a really a serious car wrecks like when you smash all your ribs because this was nothing compared to something like a car wreck what I've seen other people go through and finally I got air in my lungs and I went back in I thought maybe if I just do some light back exercises over here because it was also hurt my back because it compressed my entire rib cage it hurt in the front and in my spine in the back
[00:14:06.104 --> 00:14:18.225]  I thought maybe if I do some, you know, lightweights, and I couldn't even do that, and I went home, felt a lot better, took some Advil, and I went ahead and jogged.
[00:14:19.913 --> 00:14:25.958]  And my dad came over, he's a dentist, but he took a basic anatomy and he felt, he said, yeah, I can feel it move a bit.
[00:14:26.058 --> 00:14:27.620]  It's cracked a lot.
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.681]  He said, that's going to really hurt in four or five days.
[00:14:30.042 --> 00:14:34.546]  When it starts to heal, your body's not going to want you to be moving around and try to form a cast.
[00:14:34.586 --> 00:14:38.229]  And so unless you lay in a bed for a month, that's going to get really painful.
[00:14:38.649 --> 00:14:39.370]  Boy, is he right.
[00:14:40.491 --> 00:14:44.034]  It has now gotten to the point where I have to make myself go through pain
[00:14:45.888 --> 00:14:52.210]  to breathe deep or it's like this asthma-like or anxiety attack-like feeling of not being able to breathe.
[00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:52.910]  It's really weird.
[00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:58.953]  So if you just see me breathing deep, I'm not doing Buddhist meditation.
[00:14:58.973 --> 00:15:01.914]  I am just trying to breathe here.
[00:15:02.354 --> 00:15:03.114]  I can't imagine.
[00:15:03.134 --> 00:15:04.034]  I remember my grandmother.
[00:15:05.575 --> 00:15:10.977]  I was living with them for a year because I've gotten into so much trouble as a sophomore in high school and I was
[00:15:12.119 --> 00:15:13.441]  Just out of school, basically, for a year.
[00:15:13.461 --> 00:15:14.803]  That's why I was in high school for five years.
[00:15:15.244 --> 00:15:19.089]  And I was there when she got the call from a biopsy that she had lung cancer.
[00:15:21.735 --> 00:15:24.037]  I remember her going, well that's it, I've got lung cancer.
[00:15:24.177 --> 00:15:27.579]  And then I remember her all healthy, happy, you know, beautiful.
[00:15:27.919 --> 00:15:30.061]  And I remember a few weeks later, she gets that surgery.
[00:15:30.421 --> 00:15:31.662]  They cut part of her lung out.
[00:15:32.442 --> 00:15:36.165]  And it, you know, ends up basically paralyzing part of her face for a while.
[00:15:36.265 --> 00:15:38.586]  Nerve problems, probably caused a small stroke.
[00:15:39.127 --> 00:15:42.449]  And then that causing, you know, many years of her degenerating down until she died.
[00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:49.194]  But I remember living with her for a few months, then I moved back to Dallas after she had that.
[00:15:49.214 --> 00:15:50.655]  And I remember her sitting there.
[00:15:51.638 --> 00:15:57.861]  And just going, and not saying why she was doing it, breathing in real slow and just sitting there with a cup of coffee.
[00:15:58.322 --> 00:16:04.105]  And then later I asked her and she said, oh, it's just excruciating to even breathe, but you have to make yourself breathe.
[00:16:04.585 --> 00:16:16.131]  Imagine that, like a hundred times the pain I'm in right now that people go through when they're in car wrecks or they have lung or heart surgery.
[00:16:16.472 --> 00:16:18.153]  I was talking to Marcos Morales.
[00:16:19.167 --> 00:16:26.753]  One of our great video editors here for the Nightly News, and graphics people, was talking about his dad had triple bypass open heart surgery.
[00:16:27.773 --> 00:16:32.116]  And he said that, you know, just for months, just breathing was torture.
[00:16:32.517 --> 00:16:42.584]  And I was just thinking about, you better enjoy your life now, because every moment is a precious moment in your life.
[00:16:44.746 --> 00:16:46.047]  Every moment is wonderful.
[00:16:47.299 --> 00:16:49.281]  And enjoy when you're healthy.
[00:16:49.361 --> 00:16:51.382]  Enjoy when you're not in excruciating pain.
[00:16:51.822 --> 00:16:53.583]  Enjoy the good times in life.
[00:16:57.166 --> 00:17:00.368]  It's like that Cars song about, uh, let the good times roll.
[00:17:01.449 --> 00:17:05.872]  And America is a great country, full of wonderful people.
[00:17:05.932 --> 00:17:08.694]  The world is a wonderful planet, full of great people.
[00:17:08.754 --> 00:17:14.478]  So much beauty, so much art, so many good things, so many innocent things to defend.
[00:17:17.046 --> 00:17:19.767]  And you're not going to escape pain in this life.
[00:17:19.807 --> 00:17:21.368]  You're not going to escape conflict.
[00:17:21.888 --> 00:17:23.428]  You're not going to escape it.
[00:17:23.608 --> 00:17:25.489]  We all need to face our fear.
[00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:35.033]  We all need to get to that point and basically prepare ourselves for the struggles that are coming in life.
[00:17:35.053 --> 00:17:38.234]  Whether it's children that get sick or children that die.
[00:17:38.294 --> 00:17:39.774]  They say that's the worst thing in the world.
[00:17:40.955 --> 00:17:43.536]  Or brain cancer or car wrecks.
[00:17:45.376 --> 00:17:46.276]  Or whatever it is.
[00:17:46.436 --> 00:17:53.679]  But then you see the globalists on the other side of that equation.
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.701]  They enjoy the pain.
[00:17:57.901 --> 00:17:59.962]  They don't just not have feelings for others.
[00:18:01.142 --> 00:18:02.603]  They hate life.
[00:18:04.159 --> 00:18:08.404]  And they hate innocents and they revel in horrifying people.
[00:18:08.484 --> 00:18:12.428]  They revel in terrorizing women and children.
[00:18:12.968 --> 00:18:16.152]  They get off on just horrible abominations.
[00:18:16.772 --> 00:18:23.900]  And it's up to us that can recognize good from evil to protect the general public who is sheep-like.
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:31.345]  And has been basically brought up in a coma-like state watching television in this culture of death who have no idea what's happening to them.
[00:18:31.705 --> 00:18:37.248]  It's up to us to not be angry at them and be cynical and call them stupid sheeple and stuff like I've done a thousand times.
[00:18:37.829 --> 00:18:42.232]  It's really up to us to reach out to them and realize how sad they are.
[00:18:43.092 --> 00:18:51.277]  But the unbelievable evil of injecting children worldwide with live cancer viruses, HIV, hepatitis,
[00:18:54.431 --> 00:18:57.692]  Polio, it was in the news again, just yesterday we covered it.
[00:18:58.772 --> 00:19:02.174]  Killing kids in secret illegal vaccine trials.
[00:19:02.794 --> 00:19:21.420]  I mean, knowing that Gardasil kills people and doesn't even protect them from human papillomavirus, knowing it, consciously, just to see them, knowing that Ritalin causes deformities, shrinkage in the brain, all sorts of health problems, heart expansion,
[00:19:24.485 --> 00:19:26.707]  To know that what Prozac is so deadly.
[00:19:27.347 --> 00:19:30.270]  To know it's a toxic psychotropic and they're pushing it on kids.
[00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:32.251]  To just know that they're doing this.
[00:19:33.072 --> 00:19:36.514]  It's not a question of if, but when we stand up to these people.
[00:19:38.078 --> 00:19:43.261]  Again, I wasn't going to talk about this, but now I obviously had to talk about the ribcage thing, because it's too obvious.
[00:19:43.301 --> 00:19:48.224]  But I'm going to stay on air today, and I'm going to stay on air tomorrow, because this pain is not that bad.
[00:19:48.244 --> 00:19:55.608]  And if my grandmother could walk around with something 10 times, 20 times more painful, then I can certainly do a radio show with this.
[00:19:55.688 --> 00:19:56.648]  So I'm not going to wimp out.
[00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.709]  I'm going to be here.
[00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:59.730]  OK, enough about that.
[00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:00.811]  The news coming up.

[00:24:16.643 --> 00:24:25.750]  All right, we've got Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joining us coming up to talk about the incredible escalations towards open war with Iran and what that will lead to.
[00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:37.779]  The unprecedented power grabs, even mainline analysts on quote mainline television are saying it's an unprecedented power grab, court fight over recess appointments almost certain.
[00:24:39.136 --> 00:24:42.778]  Obama to violate a federal law and the Constitution to do this.
[00:24:43.318 --> 00:24:44.699]  Huge power grab.
[00:24:45.179 --> 00:24:51.522]  And he violates congressional laws the Democrats, by the way, rammed through more than a decade ago on top of it.
[00:24:52.803 --> 00:24:56.505]  We've got incredible economic news on the job front.
[00:24:59.246 --> 00:25:02.928]  And coming up in the next segment, I want to illustrate
[00:25:04.468 --> 00:25:07.789]  That we can fight back against the National Defense Authorization Act.
[00:25:08.309 --> 00:25:14.450]  There's a reason Obama first said he would not sign it, that he would veto it.
[00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:16.591]  That way people thought, oh, well, it's not going to pass.
[00:25:17.351 --> 00:25:18.091]  We don't have to fight it.
[00:25:18.531 --> 00:25:23.953]  Then he could also then quietly sign it, try to confuse people, and then not have a political fight over it.
[00:25:24.373 --> 00:25:27.313]  They don't want to have a debate about, oh, you can secretly arrest us.
[00:25:27.934 --> 00:25:29.614]  You're doing what Hitler did.
[00:25:31.653 --> 00:25:38.194]  I mean, this really illustrates everything we've warned, that they've gotten rid of posse comitatus, that they're going to have military on the streets.
[00:25:38.694 --> 00:25:40.735]  So when we come back, I'm going to air this special report.
[00:25:40.895 --> 00:25:53.098]  And before I get to that report, when we come out of the next segment, I'm going to break down this big report that's also up at the Drudge Report, but it's also obviously at Infowars.com because it's our story.
[00:25:53.518 --> 00:25:59.839]  DHS officers armed with semi-automatics set up unannounced ID checkpoint in Florida.
[00:26:01.681 --> 00:26:04.743]  Papers, please, with submachine guns.
[00:26:06.905 --> 00:26:10.947]  And it's happening everywhere with local police under their command.
[00:26:11.047 --> 00:26:14.390]  I mean, this is off the charts unconstitutional.
[00:26:15.531 --> 00:26:18.212]  Remember two years ago in Florida, the governor said stop doing this.
[00:26:18.913 --> 00:26:27.299]  Families would pull up to the army, state police, dragging them out of cars, whole highways shut down, and Homeland Security said John Warner Fence Authorization Act.
[00:26:28.832 --> 00:26:30.893]  We can take you out of office, Governor.
[00:26:31.153 --> 00:26:32.154]  We'll do what we want.
[00:26:32.254 --> 00:26:33.815]  I mean, this is total federal takeover.
[00:26:33.835 --> 00:26:35.755]  And people say, well, the feds can do that.
[00:26:35.795 --> 00:26:36.076]  Oh, really?
[00:26:36.096 --> 00:26:37.596]  The feds are run by foreign banks.
[00:26:40.417 --> 00:26:40.978]  You understand?
[00:26:41.558 --> 00:26:42.678]  We've been taken over.
[00:26:42.738 --> 00:26:44.119]  We are an occupied nation.
[00:26:44.999 --> 00:26:45.580]  But here it is.
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:50.202]  DHS officers are in a semi-automatic setup, unannounced ID checkpoint.
[00:26:51.149 --> 00:26:52.350]  In Leesburg, Florida.
[00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:53.330]  Here's another one.
[00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:58.654]  Big Brother malls trigger privacy fight after installing equipment to spy on shoppers via their mobiles.
[00:26:59.014 --> 00:26:59.914]  This is already in place.
[00:27:00.735 --> 00:27:11.722]  It's come out in mainstream news a decade ago that most malls have almost subliminal level audio under the mall music saying, buy, buy, happiness, you'll be happy when you buy.
[00:27:12.222 --> 00:27:14.284]  I mean, we're under mind control.
[00:27:14.824 --> 00:27:16.826]  Just become aware of it.
[00:27:17.267 --> 00:27:18.768]  And then it's still hard to fight.
[00:27:19.208 --> 00:27:26.695]  But if you are naive and just say, no, nothing's happening, everything's fine, why do you think they want tyranny right now?
[00:27:28.357 --> 00:27:33.361]  Because this is a global financial implosion by design.
[00:27:33.481 --> 00:27:34.762]  This is being done by design.
[00:27:36.772 --> 00:27:44.880]  Now of course the biggest news of the day, I'm going to get into right now and more with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts when he joins us coming up.
[00:27:45.361 --> 00:27:50.085]  Oil prices move steadily upward as EU prepares Iran embargo.
[00:27:50.959 --> 00:27:53.461]  And Iran says they will take that as an act of war.
[00:27:53.521 --> 00:27:56.183]  Half their gasoline, 51%, is imported.
[00:27:56.343 --> 00:28:06.210]  They got plenty of oil, but not the refineries that are always getting blown up by al-Qaeda terrorists who work for, guess who, on record, the criminals that run our country.
[00:28:06.891 --> 00:28:09.973]  You're like, al-Qaeda works for people that run our government?
[00:28:10.173 --> 00:28:10.833]  On record?
[00:28:10.853 --> 00:28:18.179]  That's one thing really freaking out the neocons when their caller's calling and go, why is our government putting al-Qaeda in charge of Libya?
[00:28:19.389 --> 00:28:22.611]  They go, that's because Obama's a secret Muslim.
[00:28:22.791 --> 00:28:24.453]  Oh yes, yes, he's a secret Muslim.
[00:28:26.034 --> 00:28:26.914]  And I'm an Easter Bunny.
[00:28:27.275 --> 00:28:29.036]  He's a CIA globalist.
[00:28:29.977 --> 00:28:33.079]  They use the Muslim extremist to overthrow countries.
[00:28:33.399 --> 00:28:37.082]  By the way, it's in the news that Hosni Mubarak is facing the death penalty.
[00:28:38.155 --> 00:28:40.136]  And globalists back to judges.
[00:28:40.356 --> 00:28:42.338]  There's a worse tyranny in charge there now.
[00:28:43.058 --> 00:28:47.121]  And Mubarak wouldn't follow every order to get behind World War III and attack Iran.
[00:28:47.721 --> 00:28:48.682]  He wouldn't get behind that.
[00:28:49.042 --> 00:28:49.542]  So guess what?
[00:28:49.582 --> 00:28:54.025]  They're now going to have a kangaroo trial and execute their old minion.
[00:28:55.466 --> 00:28:57.467]  There's no honor amongst thieves, my friends.
[00:28:58.928 --> 00:29:00.329]  So, top news here.
[00:29:00.589 --> 00:29:00.709]  U.S.
[00:29:00.729 --> 00:29:01.750]  troops going to Israel.
[00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:04.872]  The Jerusalem Post is not calling it an exercise, but a deployment.
[00:29:05.977 --> 00:29:08.819]  Ahead of possible war with Iran.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.142]  Continuing, the war on Iran, the deployment of thousands of U.S.
[00:29:13.162 --> 00:29:18.665]  troops to Israel, the integration of U.S.-Israel command structures ahead of a joint strike.
[00:29:20.466 --> 00:29:25.689]  Saudi's Gulf states on war alert for early U.S.-Iran clash.
[00:29:25.749 --> 00:29:27.751]  Debka file, that's Israeli Intel Connect.
[00:29:28.911 --> 00:29:29.512]  Continuing,
[00:29:31.212 --> 00:29:34.015]  Libyan leader warns of civil war after Tripoli gun battles.
[00:29:34.115 --> 00:29:35.436]  Exactly what the globalists wanted.
[00:29:35.956 --> 00:29:37.558]  They want to wreck society.
[00:29:37.998 --> 00:29:38.298]  U.S.
[00:29:38.338 --> 00:29:40.781]  commander visits Israel to finalize missile drill.
[00:29:41.581 --> 00:29:42.482]  Jerusalem Post.
[00:29:42.642 --> 00:29:43.523]  It's on.
[00:29:44.604 --> 00:29:45.285]  It's on.
[00:29:45.405 --> 00:29:49.008]  And the TSA's coming with machine guns to street corners near you.
[00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:51.691]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.191 --> 00:29:53.792]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.713 --> 00:29:57.396]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.702 --> 00:30:06.303]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:30:06.703 --> 00:30:09.704]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:30:09.944 --> 00:30:14.725]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:30:14.745 --> 00:30:21.007]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:30:21.127 --> 00:30:23.368]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:30:23.908 --> 00:30:24.188]  Tim Geithner?
[00:30:24.228 --> 00:30:24.448]  Bernanke?
[00:30:24.468 --> 00:30:25.028]  They're arsonists!
[00:30:25.049 --> 00:30:25.829]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:30:25.849 --> 00:30:27.530]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:30:42.816 --> 00:30:46.761]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:30:47.202 --> 00:30:49.765]  we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:30:50.106 --> 00:30:59.459]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:31:01.348 --> 00:31:05.149]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are, a decade into the 21st century?
[00:31:05.489 --> 00:31:07.370]  Record foreclosure rates for homes.
[00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:09.251]  If not yours, your neighbors.
[00:31:09.631 --> 00:31:12.132]  Thankful for the unemployment checks since you were laid off.
[00:31:12.592 --> 00:31:19.074]  And placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[00:31:19.574 --> 00:31:22.796]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?
[00:31:22.816 --> 00:31:27.738]  The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control.
[00:31:28.039 --> 00:31:29.299]  Your greatest dependency.
[00:31:29.559 --> 00:31:30.620]  Your food supply.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.842]  Make 2012 the year you take control by getting prepared.
[00:31:35.182 --> 00:31:39.465]  eFoods Direct introduces the best way to build your food supply in the 21st century.

[00:32:02.045 --> 00:32:03.547]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:03.767 --> 00:32:08.794]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:32:09.074 --> 00:32:10.436]  Saving means to make money.
[00:32:10.617 --> 00:32:19.408]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:32:20.129 --> 00:32:27.232]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:32:27.652 --> 00:32:35.275]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:32:35.655 --> 00:32:40.577]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:32:40.877 --> 00:32:43.058]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:32:45.779 --> 00:32:48.745]  Call 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at five star soap .com.
[00:32:49.045 --> 00:32:53.554]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at five star soap .com.
[00:33:30.419 --> 00:33:36.244]  See the general system preparing to go into collapse.
[00:33:38.385 --> 00:33:40.627]  See the generals gathered in their masses.
[00:33:42.849 --> 00:33:45.230]  Just like witches at black masses.
[00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:49.454]  It is a sacrifice.
[00:33:49.534 --> 00:33:52.116]  It is a religion.
[00:33:52.436 --> 00:33:55.879]  They are sorcerers of death's construction.
[00:33:58.697 --> 00:34:01.580]  They are the individuals that worship the power of evil.
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:07.946]  As the global preemptive war machine keeps turning.
[00:34:08.406 --> 00:34:11.909]  And how do the globalists invade attack nations?
[00:34:11.949 --> 00:34:16.634]  They finance radicals to then have a pretext to later destroy them.
[00:34:18.117 --> 00:34:38.306]  And I told you eight, nine months ago when this whole war against Libya began that they would put Al Qaeda in charge and then later have a civil war and use that as a pretext to bring in more NATO forces and fully occupy the nation permanently as a Afrikan base to invade all of Africa.
[00:34:40.202 --> 00:34:40.862]  How did I know that?
[00:34:40.942 --> 00:34:48.065]  Because that was public Pentagon plans, and we covered it in the Obama Deception, now out for a little over three years.
[00:34:48.986 --> 00:34:51.827]  People watch Obama Deception and they say, was this just made?
[00:34:53.387 --> 00:34:58.350]  Because this has been out since March, early March of 2009.
[00:34:59.010 --> 00:34:59.870]  How did you do this?
[00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:02.631]  Because the globalists operate in the open.
[00:35:03.752 --> 00:35:06.253]  They have the disinformation, they give the general public.
[00:35:07.318 --> 00:35:11.139]  Just like they would say, 15 years ago, the NSA didn't exist.
[00:35:11.179 --> 00:35:22.781]  They would say that on the news, and they would have national media, I type myself and others, if you talked about Echelon and spying on citizens, and when they were ready, they said, yeah, it's been around for 30 years, we spy on everything you do.
[00:35:22.801 --> 00:35:31.403]  Remember smart meters, five years ago, in California, people were saying, hey,
[00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:36.272]  These smart meters can control how hot our house is, how cold it is.
[00:35:36.292 --> 00:35:37.052]  You can track us.
[00:35:37.473 --> 00:35:38.893]  You can get data out of our house.
[00:35:38.913 --> 00:35:39.834]  You can tell what we're doing.
[00:35:40.234 --> 00:35:41.455]  Oh, shut up, conspiracy theorists.
[00:35:41.475 --> 00:35:42.055]  We never do that.
[00:35:42.355 --> 00:35:43.876]  Now they openly admit it.
[00:35:44.737 --> 00:35:45.877]  Once it's deployed.
[00:35:47.919 --> 00:35:49.700]  And this will destroy our entire future.
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:52.641]  This will destroy people that serve the military, police, bureaucrats.
[00:35:53.202 --> 00:35:55.143]  All of you have to decide what side you're on.
[00:35:56.564 --> 00:36:02.948]  And they're now announcing TSA is setting up more and more checkpoints across the United States.
[00:36:03.649 --> 00:36:06.311]  And we're going to break that down after this piece.
[00:36:07.271 --> 00:36:10.073]  Here is my report on the NDAA.
[00:36:10.774 --> 00:36:12.435]  It is not too late to turn it around.
[00:36:12.495 --> 00:36:14.656]  You cannot legalize tyranny.
[00:36:14.936 --> 00:36:17.498]  They may say this is a law, but it's a fraud.
[00:36:17.518 --> 00:36:18.239]  Here it is.
[00:36:19.236 --> 00:36:28.560]  Under the provisions, would it be possible that an American citizen then could be declared an enemy combatant and sent to Guantanamo Bay and detained indefinitely?
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:31.441]  They said it couldn't happen here.
[00:36:31.741 --> 00:36:37.523]  The administration asked us to remove the language which says that U.S.
[00:36:37.543 --> 00:36:41.845]  citizens and lawful residents would not be subject to this section.
[00:36:41.865 --> 00:36:44.406]  There would never be trips on the streets of America.
[00:36:45.606 --> 00:36:47.627]  There would always be due process.
[00:36:48.382 --> 00:36:51.946]  And when they say, I want my lawyer, you tell them, shut up!
[00:36:52.266 --> 00:36:52.927]  Your time is expired.
[00:36:52.947 --> 00:36:53.267]  Get a lawyer.
[00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:55.210]  You're an enemy, come back!
[00:36:55.530 --> 00:37:02.752]  It was the conspiracy theorists that warned that there was a plan to overthrow our republic and use the military against the people.
[00:37:03.312 --> 00:37:08.393]  That FEMA camps had been built, that citizens could be secretly arrested and disappeared.
[00:37:08.833 --> 00:37:16.174]  I want that person to be terrified about what's going to happen to them in American custody.
[00:37:16.294 --> 00:37:18.095]  And now NDAA 2012 is law.
[00:37:20.405 --> 00:37:21.566]  It did happen here.
[00:37:21.686 --> 00:37:23.367]  Please know what will come your way.
[00:37:23.787 --> 00:37:26.428]  Death, detention, prosecution.
[00:37:26.888 --> 00:37:27.709]  It's illegitimate.
[00:37:27.989 --> 00:37:28.749]  It's a fraud.
[00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:30.931]  It's tyranny in your face.
[00:37:32.011 --> 00:37:38.575]  The only question is, will the people of the United States let this tyranny now be put into action?
[00:37:38.975 --> 00:37:41.876]  It's one thing to pass an unconstitutional law.
[00:37:42.237 --> 00:37:44.998]  It's another thing to actually implement it.
[00:37:45.278 --> 00:37:48.160]  The globalists have bitten off more than they can chew.
[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:56.005]  The republic is rising and the spirit of 1776 flies proudly on our banners.
[00:37:57.025 --> 00:38:03.510]  It's time for everybody out there watching to have a gut check and to decide what side are you on.
[00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:06.291]  Do you stand with our constitutional republic?
[00:38:06.992 --> 00:38:14.657]  Or do you stand with the corrupt politicians that have been bought and sold a hundred times by offshore megabanks that are conquering this country through fraud?
[00:38:16.007 --> 00:38:28.600]  The reason the National Defense Authorization Act was rammed through Congress and the reason President Obama treacherously and traitorously signed it is because the power structure, the ruling class, is scared of the people.
[00:38:29.201 --> 00:38:32.284]  They know that we're waking up to the private Federal Reserve banking cartel.
[00:38:32.725 --> 00:38:34.867]  They know that we're waking up to secret arrest and torture.
[00:38:35.388 --> 00:38:36.389]  They know that we know.
[00:38:37.264 --> 00:38:47.530]  That offshore banks have taken over this country through fraud and signed us on to over a thousand trillion dollars of fraudulent garbage derivatives paper.
[00:38:48.871 --> 00:38:53.454]  They know the Ponzi scheme is coming down and so they rammed through the NDAA.
[00:38:54.813 --> 00:39:00.154]  And Obama said that he was going to veto it so that he wouldn't take the political pressure.
[00:39:00.894 --> 00:39:08.916]  Then he signed it in the final hours of 2011 when he thought everybody wasn't paying attention and was partying on New Year's Eve.
[00:39:10.136 --> 00:39:13.336]  And he did that because crimes are committed in the dark.
[00:39:13.816 --> 00:39:18.437]  They don't want their open tyranny to be a wake-up call to people.
[00:39:19.017 --> 00:39:22.598]  They want to silently have our republic go into that long night.
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:26.642]  They want to stab this country in the back when nobody's watching.
[00:39:27.003 --> 00:39:27.683]  There's a problem.
[00:39:27.883 --> 00:39:28.404]  I'm watching.
[00:39:28.704 --> 00:39:29.705]  Ron Paul's watching.
[00:39:30.005 --> 00:39:30.665]  You're watching.
[00:39:30.905 --> 00:39:31.826]  And we're involved.
[00:39:32.587 --> 00:39:37.410]  And like Paul Revere before us, we are warning people worldwide.
[00:39:39.612 --> 00:39:41.894]  Just look at the NDAA and its passage.
[00:39:42.274 --> 00:39:43.175]  All the lies.
[00:39:43.395 --> 00:39:45.036]  Oh, at first it didn't affect citizens.
[00:39:45.096 --> 00:39:46.077]  Now they admit it does.
[00:39:46.597 --> 00:39:49.019]  A global declaration of war against all countries.
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:52.462]  Congress handing that power to the president, making him a dictator.
[00:39:54.113 --> 00:39:55.414]  Secret arrest of citizens.
[00:39:55.954 --> 00:39:56.354]  Torture.
[00:39:56.734 --> 00:39:57.755]  Indefinite detention.
[00:39:58.895 --> 00:40:01.936]  Then the Senators came out who authored it and said, you bet it affects citizens.
[00:40:02.196 --> 00:40:03.317]  We want you to be scared.
[00:40:04.878 --> 00:40:06.738]  And they went further and said, don't criticize us.
[00:40:07.039 --> 00:40:09.280]  Obama demanded this be in the legislation.
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:11.941]  The ACLU and others went to Obama and said, did you really do this?
[00:40:11.961 --> 00:40:12.601]  And they said, yes.
[00:40:13.701 --> 00:40:15.922]  That's how bad this deception has gotten.
[00:40:16.843 --> 00:40:19.364]  Where they want to have their tyrannical cake and eat it too.
[00:40:21.158 --> 00:40:24.460]  Why are they hiding the fact that it affects citizens?
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:27.602]  Why are they hiding the fact that Obama signed it?
[00:40:27.902 --> 00:40:30.824]  Because they want to do their crimes secretly.
[00:40:31.084 --> 00:40:33.325]  Because they know what they're doing is wrong.
[00:40:33.825 --> 00:40:42.790]  And they want to now implement this draconian, classical tyranny behind the scenes ahead of the next staged event.
[00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:44.291]  The next false flag.
[00:40:44.551 --> 00:40:45.692]  The next big war.
[00:40:46.172 --> 00:40:48.914]  They want to roll this out with test cases.
[00:40:49.614 --> 00:40:53.038]  With unsavory types of people like Ammar Al-Awlaki, a U.S.
[00:40:53.058 --> 00:40:56.261]  citizen, they claim that they killed extrajudicially.
[00:40:56.802 --> 00:41:01.887]  So they can sell the public on the idea of people disappearing into black holes.
[00:41:02.688 --> 00:41:05.310]  That's why it's so important now more than ever.
[00:41:06.181 --> 00:41:10.747]  To get the truth about this Defense Authorization Act to everyone you know.
[00:41:11.568 --> 00:41:22.662]  In my 17 years on air, I have never seen an issue shake people out of their sleep, out of their social trance, like this has done.
[00:41:23.283 --> 00:41:28.284]  The apologies via email and comments on our websites are coming in by the thousands.
[00:41:28.644 --> 00:41:30.725]  Radio talk show hosts are apologizing.
[00:41:31.045 --> 00:41:33.645]  Congressional aides are calling me and apologizing.
[00:41:33.986 --> 00:41:39.387]  Because everything that we warned the public about is now unfolding.
[00:41:40.707 --> 00:41:44.248]  Not just the establishment of military operations domestically.
[00:41:45.402 --> 00:41:55.249]  Not just secret arrest and torture, not just new wars, but the warrantless wiretapping, the TSA checkpoints on the highways, it's all happening.
[00:41:56.129 --> 00:42:06.076]  And the system wouldn't have rammed this legislation through and exposed their despotic game plan if they weren't accelerating their timetable.
[00:42:07.341 --> 00:42:08.462]  War with Iran.
[00:42:09.423 --> 00:42:11.165]  Economic collapse by design.
[00:42:11.245 --> 00:42:12.386]  It's all coming.
[00:42:13.027 --> 00:42:22.217]  But at this critical juncture, when the globalists are uncloaking themselves, they are extremely weak, because now they are naked in front of us.
[00:42:22.277 --> 00:42:27.222]  They are brazenly there, proving to everyone that they are criminals.
[00:42:28.303 --> 00:42:31.445]  It is treason to overthrow the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[00:42:32.145 --> 00:42:34.946]  They passed legislation before saying black people weren't humans.
[00:42:35.686 --> 00:42:40.969]  They could pass legislation saying that white people are slaves or something.
[00:42:41.329 --> 00:42:43.330]  It doesn't make it so.
[00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:48.592]  All laws that are repugnant and unconstitutional are null and void.
[00:42:49.053 --> 00:42:52.694]  Marbury versus Madison and thousands of other rulings.
[00:42:53.375 --> 00:42:55.856]  Tyrants take over by degree.
[00:42:56.796 --> 00:43:09.304]  And the system is simply testing the public now to see if they can get away with this legislation first, and then to see, piecemeal, if they can get away with it incrementally.
[00:43:09.885 --> 00:43:12.467]  They're not going to come snatch you out of your house overnight.
[00:43:12.927 --> 00:43:16.469]  They're not going to activate the now public FEMA camps overnight.
[00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:23.374]  They're going to sell it as something that they're rolling out to save and safeguard society.
[00:43:23.734 --> 00:43:26.276]  They're going to script every facet of it.
[00:43:26.736 --> 00:43:41.507]  And that's why we've got to be there at every point, confronting them, pointing out their fraud, pointing out the true history, and decrying what they're doing, just like our ancestors, Paul Revere, and our founding fathers did.
[00:43:41.808 --> 00:43:44.270]  So I am upset that they did pass the NDAA.
[00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:48.553]  It shows what tyrants and just how corrupt and ruthless they are.
[00:43:48.593 --> 00:43:49.974]  Can you imagine what's coming next?
[00:43:50.234 --> 00:43:52.276]  You notice things just get crazier and crazier now.
[00:43:53.513 --> 00:43:56.735]  I'm upset about that, but there's a silver lining in every cloud.
[00:43:57.355 --> 00:44:03.438]  This is waking people up and has really thrown the gauntlet down in everyone's face.
[00:44:04.379 --> 00:44:06.039]  It's time to make a decision.
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:08.381]  It's time to get involved.
[00:44:08.961 --> 00:44:12.443]  It's time to warn everyone you know.
[00:44:13.083 --> 00:44:16.365]  It's time to realize we've got a two-party dictatorship.
[00:44:17.225 --> 00:44:27.355]  Engage in insider trading and every other form of corruption you can imagine who think that they're going to be able to not only continue this corruption but expand it.
[00:44:27.615 --> 00:44:29.937]  That's the thing about corrupt governments.
[00:44:29.977 --> 00:44:32.680]  They get more corrupt or you bring them to justice.
[00:44:33.712 --> 00:44:35.513]  They get more emboldened.
[00:44:36.214 --> 00:44:42.879]  And then when they've gone so far that the public wakes up, they always try to come in and clamp down on the public.
[00:44:43.139 --> 00:44:44.480]  And they've always got excuses.
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:46.762]  Foreign enemies, domestic terrorists.
[00:44:47.162 --> 00:44:48.623]  It's happened over and over again.
[00:44:49.984 --> 00:44:52.806]  Incredible despotism has come to every nation in history.
[00:44:53.467 --> 00:44:54.848]  And now it's coming here.
[00:44:56.696 --> 00:44:57.537]  We know history.
[00:44:58.177 --> 00:45:03.321]  And so if we educate others and stand tall, we are not doomed to repeat it.
[00:45:04.782 --> 00:45:11.487]  So let's take this information with the NDAA and all the lies associated with it and use it as a teaching moment.
[00:45:12.728 --> 00:45:17.291]  And not just a moment of instruction, but a moment of awakening.
[00:45:18.314 --> 00:45:28.325]  It's now time for those of you out there that grovel to the establishment and go along with whatever the system does and make excuses for it to realize you are not part of the power structure.
[00:45:28.745 --> 00:45:32.329]  You haven't chosen to join the New World Order and so you're on the winning team.
[00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:39.237]  Less than one-tenth of one percent from our research is actually part of this New World Order system and stands to gain from it.
[00:45:40.319 --> 00:45:48.588]  That's what even Rothkopf, head of the Kissinger Group, wrote a few years ago in his book, Superclass, admitting a global government run by 6,000 top technocrats.
[00:45:49.249 --> 00:45:57.618]  You're not one of the technocrats that The Economist magazine pushes and promotes as our saviors, who are actually the authors and engineers of all of our problems.
[00:45:58.238 --> 00:46:00.859]  You are going to have your standard of living lowered.
[00:46:01.099 --> 00:46:02.740]  You're going to have your freedoms lowered.
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:07.201]  And just because you've served the system, doesn't mean that you won't be devoured by it.
[00:46:07.701 --> 00:46:11.042]  The good news is, for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.
[00:46:11.402 --> 00:46:14.243]  There is a giant awakening happening.
[00:46:14.704 --> 00:46:15.884]  And now is the time.
[00:46:15.944 --> 00:46:18.505]  People's minds are fertile to hear the truth.
[00:46:19.065 --> 00:46:26.250]  They have never been more open to be given the true information about history and about the New World Order and about what's happening.
[00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:42.902]  So I'm begging all of you to be the leaders you are and to reach out to everyone you can with banner hangs, local newsletters, talk radio shows, calling in to talk radio, going and speaking at your city council, running for Congress, running for mayor, running for sheriff.
[00:46:43.522 --> 00:46:45.684]  Because resistance is victory.
[00:46:46.104 --> 00:46:53.090]  We've got to intensify the buzz that we see around Ron Paul and liberty to every issue and every area.
[00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:56.713]  And all of us need to be like Ron Paul.
[00:46:57.173 --> 00:47:00.736]  All of us need to be like other patriots that have come before us.
[00:47:01.296 --> 00:47:08.943]  It's just like in the movie Spartacus, which is based on a true story of slave revolt in southern Italy against the nation-state of Rome.
[00:47:09.403 --> 00:47:11.565]  And they're looking for Spartacus and they're looking for his body.
[00:47:11.585 --> 00:47:12.466]  They're trying to find him.
[00:47:13.226 --> 00:47:16.571]  And the slaves they've captured start standing up and saying, I'm Spartacus.
[00:47:17.012 --> 00:47:18.033]  No, I'm Spartacus.
[00:47:18.413 --> 00:47:19.315]  No, I'm Spartacus.
[00:47:19.916 --> 00:47:26.044]  It's Victor Hugo that said, no army can stop an idea whose time has come.
[00:47:26.705 --> 00:47:27.626]  They can't stop us all.
[00:47:28.127 --> 00:47:29.689]  And one cautionary note.
[00:47:30.618 --> 00:47:39.946]  To enforcers of this system, military, police and others that are being asked to engage in classical oppression of the American people.
[00:47:40.587 --> 00:47:46.091]  You're going to be given plausible cover stories for doing what you're going to be asked to do in the future.
[00:47:46.612 --> 00:47:50.855]  But remember, all of this was set up in the past 16 years or so.
[00:47:51.516 --> 00:47:53.658]  All of this was being covertly planned.
[00:47:54.238 --> 00:47:58.501]  The derivatives, the banking takeover, all of this has been planned out.
[00:47:58.861 --> 00:48:04.144]  But because we have been aware of it, we've got a serious jump on the globalist right now.
[00:48:04.825 --> 00:48:10.268]  Because we were there for decades warning people ahead of time, now we have a lot of credibility.
[00:48:10.408 --> 00:48:14.051]  And I want to warn the power structure that this is not going to be a cakewalk.
[00:48:14.864 --> 00:48:28.767]  The London Telegraph, the Associated Press, they're all reporting that in the month of December, more than 1.5 million FBI instant background checks were done, and on average, people were buying two guns or more.
[00:48:28.907 --> 00:48:36.049]  We're talking about 3 million guns sold in the month of December, an all-time record.
[00:48:36.469 --> 00:48:39.070]  And the purchasing of guns is only accelerating.
[00:48:39.830 --> 00:48:50.059]  I saw surveys where the public was asked why they're buying guns, and the majority said, because of economic collapse, because of social unrest, and we don't trust the government.
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:57.786]  The system's iron fist is not going to work against an armed population that understands the score.
[00:48:58.527 --> 00:49:09.157]  And so I want to challenge the global controllers to rethink what they're doing and to look at history and to pull back and to realize that you are not in a good position.
[00:49:09.557 --> 00:49:16.364]  Even if you staged some big false flag terror attacks, the people are awakened to you and are now aware of what you're doing.
[00:49:17.401 --> 00:49:27.849]  And the American people, if you do launch this civil war operation in the U.S., are going to ensure that the controllers, not the low-level minions, are brought to justice.
[00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:40.419]  We need to be reaching out to police and military now, and asking them to make the choice to join the Republic, in the spirit of 1776, to peacefully bring back our country, and to bring these criminals to justice.
[00:49:40.959 --> 00:49:43.560]  We do not need to be played off against each other.
[00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:48.041]  This is part of the globalist plan and needs to be averted.
[00:49:49.162 --> 00:49:49.862]  Tyranny is here.
[00:49:51.002 --> 00:49:56.004]  It's up to you to face it and to take action against it through peaceful ways.
[00:49:56.524 --> 00:50:10.349]  Let us work now while the sun still shines, so that if we do go into that dark night of true, hardcore tyranny, we would have done everything we could beforehand to avert what's coming.
[00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:18.882]  I know from history, many times tyrannies are defused if the public is warned by patriots.
[00:50:19.262 --> 00:50:21.323]  We've got a good chance of doing that right now.
[00:50:22.083 --> 00:50:25.304]  I'm Alex Jones, signing off from the front lines of the InfoWars.

[00:52:01.141 --> 00:52:08.447]  Did you know nuclear radiation is still spewing out of the melted-down reactors in Fukushima, Japan and making its way across the entire U.S.

[00:53:49.058 --> 00:53:49.898]  Or call toll free 866-369-3678.
[00:53:49.918 --> 00:53:50.238]  That's 866-369-3678.
[00:53:50.278 --> 00:53:51.439]  Pro-EM1, the raw probiotic.
[00:54:39.571 --> 00:54:41.273]  We die for the system.
[00:54:43.895 --> 00:54:44.775]  Here's what I want to do.
[00:54:46.637 --> 00:54:58.786]  I want to run through some more of the news in the next segment or so, but I do want to take your calls before Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former head of policy at the Department of Treasury, joins us at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:55:00.595 --> 00:55:04.699]  I'd like to get your breakdown and view on the special report we just aired.
[00:55:05.499 --> 00:55:21.473]  I'd like to get your take on the fact that they've gone from saying they might attack Iran to selling the idea that it's a foregone conclusion as that military buildup in Kuwait, Israel, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, and other nations accelerates.
[00:55:22.173 --> 00:55:24.515]  I've talked to military sources and they say it's on.
[00:55:25.436 --> 00:55:30.780]  They were thinking about doing it late last year, but now it's going to happen sometime before the election.
[00:55:32.261 --> 00:55:39.667]  So, we are certainly trying to avert that happening.
[00:55:40.988 --> 00:55:52.697]  We do need to discuss exactly what it's going to mean and what is going to unfold if this crisis goes live.
[00:55:54.192 --> 00:55:55.633]  And they're certainly moving towards that.
[00:55:56.173 --> 00:55:57.754]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:56:03.919 --> 00:56:10.262]  800-259-9231, and we will get you up and on the air today.
[00:56:11.483 --> 00:56:15.705]  We can also talk about Obama's unprecedented power grab with these recess appointments.
[00:56:16.506 --> 00:56:26.491]  I'm going to get into a bunch of high-tech technology news, including top radiation doctor says TSA naked body scanners can cause cancer, but a whole bunch of them come out.
[00:56:27.072 --> 00:56:28.973]  And this is out of the Florida Sun Sentinel.
[00:56:29.993 --> 00:56:33.758]  Uh, Natural News is reporting on that, uh, but the TSA is told it's good for them.
[00:56:33.778 --> 00:56:36.902]  Because they tell the troops DU's good for them now.
[00:56:37.022 --> 00:56:37.783]  Oh, don't worry about it.
[00:56:37.803 --> 00:56:41.247]  Uh, this is the level of deception we're dealing with.
[00:56:42.321 --> 00:57:03.903]  Now the video slash audio report that we just premiered here, that's powerful audio-wise, but really powerful when you can see it, is key to alert Americans to what we face and how our own military is being trained and turned against us, along with giant federal security forces who've been taught total disdain for the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:09.621]  I've run into the Viper teams in New York back when they were beta testing them and they bug their eyes out at old ladies.
[00:57:10.242 --> 00:57:11.102]  They search bags.
[00:57:11.122 --> 00:57:12.062]  They scream at people.
[00:57:12.823 --> 00:57:17.444]  They stand around like they're out of a comic book of bad guys.
[00:57:18.304 --> 00:57:21.645]  And sit there with their guns looking back and forth like terrorists are everywhere.
[00:57:22.066 --> 00:57:25.947]  I mean, you've got to be mentally ill to think that the threat is so imminent.
[00:57:26.967 --> 00:57:33.010]  And they find little kids, men that are basically little kids, who want to play army against us, the people.
[00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:35.951]  And this happens in every other country, it's happening here.
[00:57:36.291 --> 00:57:37.612]  We've got to turn this around.
[00:57:38.832 --> 00:57:46.976]  And the title of the article and the video going up in minutes at InfoWars.com is, NDAA is a hoax.
[00:57:47.536 --> 00:57:50.437]  You cannot legalize tyranny.
[00:57:51.918 --> 00:57:53.599]  And I'll go, and I break it down in the video.
[00:57:54.039 --> 00:57:56.020]  You can say black people are slaves again.
[00:57:56.983 --> 00:57:58.525]  I don't care if you have a law, they're not.
[00:57:59.406 --> 00:58:01.488]  Just like you can have a law saying people can abort babies.
[00:58:02.028 --> 00:58:05.191]  It's always been illegal until now, and it should be illegal.
[00:58:06.953 --> 00:58:08.535]  They go, well what if it's life-threatening?
[00:58:08.675 --> 00:58:12.359]  They've always gone into surgery if the woman's gonna die.
[00:58:12.719 --> 00:58:15.281]  That's not called an abortion, it's called an emergency procedure.
[00:58:15.962 --> 00:58:16.663]  Totally different.
[00:58:19.252 --> 00:58:20.012]  Very, very simple.
[00:58:20.092 --> 00:58:22.293]  It's incredible how they play mind games with people.
[00:58:22.793 --> 00:58:24.234]  So, a crime is a crime.
[00:58:24.854 --> 00:58:29.116]  The government could pass a law saying they can, you know, use kids for skeet practice.
[00:58:30.496 --> 00:58:32.997]  Or they can take your house and make you their slave.
[00:58:33.718 --> 00:58:34.678]  It isn't a law.
[00:58:34.758 --> 00:58:35.458]  It's a fraud.
[00:58:35.518 --> 00:58:36.138]  It's a hoax.
[00:58:36.519 --> 00:58:39.420]  We need to explain this to people and form a movement against it.
[00:58:44.021 --> 00:58:47.983]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.357 --> 00:58:52.618]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:52.678 --> 00:58:58.020]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:58:58.261 --> 00:59:02.883]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:59:03.283 --> 00:59:03.683]  It's true.
[00:59:03.743 --> 00:59:06.325]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[00:59:06.565 --> 00:59:08.306]  And it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:59:08.846 --> 00:59:13.551]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:59:14.072 --> 00:59:20.999]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:22.101]  And here's the best part.
[00:59:22.321 --> 00:59:28.668]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:59:28.988 --> 00:59:31.829]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:59:32.169 --> 00:59:34.050]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:35.311]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:59:35.331 --> 00:59:35.511]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:59:35.531 --> 00:59:38.472]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:59:38.972 --> 00:59:40.733]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:59:54.306 --> 00:59:56.227]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.687 --> 00:59:59.568]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:06.010 --> 01:00:06.670]  Big Brother.
[01:00:07.310 --> 01:00:08.371]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:09.091 --> 01:00:10.251]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.271 --> 01:00:11.672]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.432 --> 01:00:14.333]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.353 --> 01:00:17.614]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.154 --> 01:00:22.235]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.418 --> 01:00:35.345]  All right, we are now into the second hour and 30 minutes.
[01:00:35.385 --> 01:00:37.707]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joins us.
[01:00:39.261 --> 01:00:39.861]  We're good.
[01:01:10.882 --> 01:01:13.904]  And who want to use our tax money to help them dominate the globe.
[01:01:14.104 --> 01:01:15.085]  Have people figured this out yet?
[01:01:15.105 --> 01:01:18.147]  We're going to be getting into that and a lot more coming up.
[01:01:18.648 --> 01:01:27.174]  And we also have Greg Hunter, a reporter, joining us to look at evidence of election fraud in Iowa ahead into
[01:01:29.517 --> 01:01:31.479]  New Hampshire and other primaries.
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:36.503]  The toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:01:37.304 --> 01:01:39.566]  Let's go ahead and go to some of your calls.
[01:01:39.646 --> 01:01:41.088]  Jim in Texas, welcome sir.
[01:01:42.889 --> 01:01:44.651]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you again.
[01:01:45.251 --> 01:01:45.812]  Great to have you.
[01:01:47.113 --> 01:01:52.275]  Hey, I wanted to comment on the Iran situation and two other things real quick, if I can get them in.
[01:01:52.315 --> 01:01:52.935]  Sure.
[01:01:53.596 --> 01:01:57.097]  First off, my opinions don't reflect that of the Department of Defense.
[01:01:57.477 --> 01:02:00.298]  I have worked in military intelligence active duty.
[01:02:00.358 --> 01:02:01.379]  I'm a combat veteran.
[01:02:02.419 --> 01:02:06.661]  I'm currently in the National Guard right now, but my views on Iran are open source.
[01:02:08.693 --> 01:02:10.874]  They can be heard in all the intelligence communities.
[01:02:11.174 --> 01:02:13.835]  This is an attack we've been getting ready for for quite some time.
[01:02:13.855 --> 01:02:18.157]  This is an attack that nobody in the military that I know wants to fight.
[01:02:19.017 --> 01:02:22.638]  And it's everything you say is true, Alex.
[01:02:22.979 --> 01:02:24.339]  I can't really refute anything.
[01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:29.541]  And what is, from open source, what are you expecting the attack to be?
[01:02:29.561 --> 01:02:30.662]  A joint strike?
[01:02:31.062 --> 01:02:33.263]  Or after Iran retaliates, then the U.S.
[01:02:33.283 --> 01:02:33.903]  gets involved?
[01:02:34.929 --> 01:02:54.224]  Well, of course we can look at our history as a nation from the USS Maine to other instances and we can pretty easily deduct that we're probably going to probably experience some sort of quote-unquote attack in the Strait of Hormuz and then retaliate.
[01:02:54.244 --> 01:02:59.289]  Why would the Iranians, we know Cheney, it came out in New York Magazine, did admittedly
[01:03:00.322 --> 01:03:01.142]  Want to paint up U.S.
[01:03:01.162 --> 01:03:12.648]  patrol boats, have Navy SEALs do a mock attack on a ship that didn't know it was a mock attack, and let the SEALs perhaps even get killed, to blame it on Iran.
[01:03:12.668 --> 01:03:19.150]  But why would Iran shoot their mouth off and say, don't come back through here with your carriers, this is your last warning?
[01:03:19.551 --> 01:03:28.395]  Why would their head of intelligence, here it is out of the Israeli Daily, Israeli National News, it was also in Iranian news,
[01:03:29.455 --> 01:03:32.818]  Iran threatens street war in Tel Aviv and U.S.
[01:03:33.458 --> 01:03:36.881]  I mean, that's just doing exactly what the globalists want.
[01:03:38.822 --> 01:03:43.946]  And we've got heroes like Fox Fallon, who saved us back in 2007.
[01:03:45.167 --> 01:03:48.390]  And Iran is, their intelligence is spot on.
[01:03:48.670 --> 01:03:50.151]  They know what's going on.
[01:03:50.611 --> 01:03:51.512]  They know our history.
[01:03:52.193 --> 01:03:56.096]  And it's a scary proposition that a lot of soldiers are afraid of.
[01:03:56.736 --> 01:03:58.937]  That's why you see so much support for Ron Paul.
[01:03:59.497 --> 01:04:07.080]  And, uh, real quick, Alex, uh, there's a former Army Ranger captain named Antonio Bueller, uh, who lives in the Austin area.
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:10.922]  And, uh, he's a strong advocate for Ron Paul, combat veteran.
[01:04:10.962 --> 01:04:13.263]  He was assaulted by the police on New Year's Eve.
[01:04:13.943 --> 01:04:18.365]  Uh, you can just go on YouTube and find that, uh, the local Austin station has already done a story.
[01:04:18.965 --> 01:04:25.908]  Uh, it's on video, and, uh, we need to support him and, uh... What happened to Antonio Bueller, is his name?
[01:04:26.991 --> 01:04:30.816]  Yeah, he's a former, he's a West Point graduate, former Army captain.
[01:04:32.057 --> 01:04:35.342]  Tony and Mueller, what'd they do to him?
[01:04:35.362 --> 01:04:39.987]  Well, he was standing up for a girl who was being ripped out of her car by Austin cops at the gas station.
[01:04:40.027 --> 01:04:45.915]  He was totally sober and he was taken down for, you know, for protecting a fellow citizen.
[01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:47.880]  Wow, you know, stay there.
[01:04:47.961 --> 01:04:53.743]  I want to hear more about what you're hearing about an attack on Iran and then this Tony Buehler report.
[01:04:54.323 --> 01:04:55.084]  We're pulling it up.
[01:04:55.424 --> 01:04:58.645]  I guess Jaren says he's already seen it, so that is a confirmed report.
[01:04:59.005 --> 01:04:59.846]  We'll get to other calls.
[01:04:59.886 --> 01:05:00.286]  Stay with us.
[01:05:02.264 --> 01:05:16.736]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:05:17.737 --> 01:05:21.420]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.

[01:07:58.596 --> 01:07:59.457]  Others don't.
[01:08:02.833 --> 01:08:08.860]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:12.464]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:24.051 --> 01:08:26.632]  All right, we are now eight minutes into the second hour.
[01:08:26.712 --> 01:08:32.273]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joining us at the bottom of the hour to break down, well, this news.
[01:08:32.353 --> 01:08:37.995]  The Israeli newspapers, including Jerusalem Post, are reporting thousands of U.S.
[01:08:38.015 --> 01:08:39.355]  troops are being deployed.
[01:08:39.435 --> 01:08:41.736]  Not going there for an exercise, but deployed.
[01:08:41.756 --> 01:08:46.117]  And there are other reports here.
[01:08:47.397 --> 01:08:56.908]  Out of the New York Times, Debka File and others, Saudi's Gulf states on war alert for early US-Iran clash.
[01:08:58.169 --> 01:08:59.270]  Here is the New York Times.
[01:08:59.691 --> 01:09:04.776]  Oil prices would skyrocket if Iran closed the Strait of Hormuz.
[01:09:06.037 --> 01:09:06.918]  It continues.
[01:09:07.987 --> 01:09:09.408]  The deployment of thousands of U.S.
[01:09:09.428 --> 01:09:13.971]  troops to Israel, the interrogation of U.S.-Israeli command structures.
[01:09:13.991 --> 01:09:16.392]  They're now integrating the U.S.-Israeli command structures.
[01:09:16.412 --> 01:09:18.313]  We're going to be breaking all of that down.
[01:09:18.353 --> 01:09:26.018]  But going back to Jim in Texas, who was saying he was in Army Intelligence, now he's in the National Guard.
[01:09:26.978 --> 01:09:31.643]  Uh, and he was saying this is all open source, what he was saying, but that yes, they're getting ready to attack Iran.
[01:09:31.964 --> 01:09:38.110]  I want you to elaborate on that because that's what all my military sources are saying and now it's pretty much mainstream, you know, fact.
[01:09:38.431 --> 01:09:47.380]  They're just making it a foregone conclusion and getting ready for the domestic checkpoints and actually setting some up and passing the Martial Law Enabling Act.
[01:09:48.421 --> 01:09:53.103]  NDAA and power grabbing with recess appointments.
[01:09:54.003 --> 01:10:01.706]  The government pretty much does whatever it wants because they think once they kick off something that could lead to World War III, everything is going to be just fine.
[01:10:02.686 --> 01:10:08.288]  Now, let's go ahead and go back to Jim in Texas.
[01:10:08.308 --> 01:10:12.009]  Jim, finish your point on that and tell us the story of what happened in Austin.
[01:10:13.533 --> 01:10:18.696]  Well Alex, you do a great job of spreading the truth.
[01:10:19.036 --> 01:10:36.945]  Operation Ajax, Operation Northwood, USS Liberty, Operation Gladio, they are all open source case studies that guys like myself and guys that I've served with in the intelligence units, we look at that and it becomes more than obvious to all of us
[01:10:37.509 --> 01:10:38.790]  What goes on behind the scenes?
[01:10:38.830 --> 01:10:41.331]  Now, a lot of us don't take part in stuff like that.
[01:10:41.371 --> 01:10:42.972]  We're there serving God and country.
[01:10:44.333 --> 01:10:47.375]  But these examples are more than out in the open.
[01:10:47.395 --> 01:10:49.096]  You mentioned Cheney in 2007.
[01:10:49.876 --> 01:10:51.157]  Fox Pound stood up to him.
[01:10:51.217 --> 01:10:57.661]  He basically got axed for that, just like Lemitzer did under JFK for Northwood.
[01:10:57.701 --> 01:11:04.165]  Then you got guys like Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer that works in the same branch of military intelligence I do.
[01:11:04.913 --> 01:11:10.576]  And he does a great job of, you know, sharing the open source with everybody else.
[01:11:10.636 --> 01:11:14.658]  But then, you know, even some of the open source gets redacted when he writes that book.
[01:11:14.738 --> 01:11:24.123]  So it's really a battle that you are helping, you know, guys like me and guys like Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer win here in the public eye.
[01:11:26.886 --> 01:11:27.526]  Well, that's right.
[01:11:27.566 --> 01:11:36.891]  Colonel Schaefer has come out and he has basically endorsed Ron Paul's analysis of what's happening with Iran.
[01:11:37.111 --> 01:11:46.616]  And there's a reason that Benjamin Netanyahu had to fire the head of Mossad last year when he told him it would be, quote, a catastrophe to attack Iran.
[01:11:46.656 --> 01:11:49.938]  He said it again two weeks ago in the Jerusalem Post in Haraz.
[01:11:51.593 --> 01:11:56.378]  Most Israelis, the polls are between 50, 60, 70 percent, but they vary.
[01:11:56.398 --> 01:11:59.180]  But it's around half or more, depending on which poll you look at.
[01:12:00.262 --> 01:12:01.122]  They don't want this war.
[01:12:01.643 --> 01:12:04.626]  And it's not like the former head of the Mossad's a fan of Iran.
[01:12:05.086 --> 01:12:07.509]  They know that it's going to unify the entire Arab world.
[01:12:08.930 --> 01:12:14.495]  They're going to end up basically launching a
[01:12:16.073 --> 01:12:21.818]  Giant attack through surrogates against Israel, but see, that's what some of the leadership in Israel and the U.S.
[01:12:21.858 --> 01:12:24.120]  and Europe want, because it'll be a diversion.
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:31.626]  The big crisis will be a diversion from the banker bailouts, the banking takeovers, the carbon taxes, the police state, the fast and furious.
[01:12:32.487 --> 01:12:38.610]  And it will allow them to take even more liberties because they know people tend to rally around the flag once a big war starts.
[01:12:38.670 --> 01:12:48.914]  I mean, you know, if our ships are getting blown up and there's just an all-out huge war, it won't be like the military just going in and killing a bunch of, you know, starving Iraqis and then a few troops get killed.
[01:12:48.934 --> 01:12:49.635]  When the U.S.
[01:12:49.735 --> 01:12:56.318]  is really in a serious war with a lot of casualties, people tend to just say, well, I don't like the war, but we got to get behind them.
[01:12:56.978 --> 01:12:59.019]  And it's going to be horrible.
[01:12:59.419 --> 01:13:01.200]  They have maneuvered us into this position.
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:04.921]  And, again, it's not our government.
[01:13:05.041 --> 01:13:06.841]  Foreign interests run our government.
[01:13:07.421 --> 01:13:08.721]  Globalists run our government.
[01:13:08.741 --> 01:13:09.802]  Globalists run Israel.
[01:13:10.242 --> 01:13:12.782]  And they want this new giant war with Iran.
[01:13:13.863 --> 01:13:19.484]  And I go back to Iran and the current mullahs being flown in by the CIA in 79.
[01:13:19.684 --> 01:13:20.624]  People are like, are you kidding?
[01:13:20.644 --> 01:13:22.264]  Yeah, just like Al-Qaeda was given Libya.
[01:13:22.284 --> 01:13:27.465]  I mean, 20 years from now, will I be saying, you know, remember when Libya was given to Al-Qaeda by NATO?
[01:13:27.485 --> 01:13:28.526]  People are like, oh yeah, right.
[01:13:28.866 --> 01:13:29.526]  It's a fact.
[01:13:30.558 --> 01:13:32.179]  Folks know that now, it's just been in the news.
[01:13:32.819 --> 01:13:44.723]  20 years from now, people may not remember, but in 79, now 30-plus years ago, they brought him in and they claimed there was double-crossing going on, but they used the same radicals to overthrow Mozadek in 53.
[01:13:45.283 --> 01:13:48.264]  So, this could all just be saber-rattling.
[01:13:49.804 --> 01:13:50.925]  I mean, at a certain point,
[01:13:52.239 --> 01:13:58.502]  I don't think Iran works with the globalists, but I know with Iran-Contra, they got missiles and things, you know, and deals secretly.
[01:13:59.042 --> 01:14:04.084]  And our government used drug money, cocaine money in the U.S., to be able to buy those weapons off record.
[01:14:04.304 --> 01:14:05.245]  That's all on record.
[01:14:05.305 --> 01:14:06.826]  So, what do you think?
[01:14:06.866 --> 01:14:09.827]  What do your colleagues think about what's going on?
[01:14:11.208 --> 01:14:13.409]  Well, they're scared to death.
[01:14:14.741 --> 01:14:20.951]  You know, we might be called to go to war with Iran because Iran, like you mentioned, it's not Iraq.
[01:14:21.272 --> 01:14:22.434]  It's not Afghanistan.
[01:14:23.936 --> 01:14:25.258]  It's a much different threat.
[01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:27.422]  They know what's going on.
[01:14:28.223 --> 01:14:44.226]  And, you know, some of the toll that we've taken, I tried to get on the other day when you had Dr. Doug Rakhion, one of my friends who, I can't name his name, he doesn't want his story going out, but he hasn't even made it to 30 yet and he's riddled with cancer.
[01:14:44.506 --> 01:14:45.287]  He's gonna die.
[01:14:46.547 --> 01:14:48.187]  It started off as thyroid cancer.
[01:14:48.567 --> 01:14:49.307]  He's gonna die.
[01:14:49.948 --> 01:14:55.289]  And a lot of us, you know, we've been exposed to all sorts of depleted uranium.
[01:14:55.829 --> 01:14:56.529]  We slept in
[01:14:57.449 --> 01:14:57.829]  We're good
[01:15:15.034 --> 01:15:23.000]  These monsters like Gingrich or Santorum, Draft Dodger, Newt, we have to understand that we are being led to slaughter.
[01:15:24.181 --> 01:15:25.362]  They don't care about us anymore.
[01:15:25.402 --> 01:15:28.264]  Guys like Dr. Doug Rocky, they give their life.
[01:15:28.304 --> 01:15:30.686]  How many operations does a guy have?
[01:15:30.726 --> 01:15:32.888]  Thirty-some?
[01:15:32.908 --> 01:15:34.129]  And members of his team are dead?
[01:15:34.569 --> 01:15:43.136]  This is all going to happen to us, and if we don't stand up and become a vocal minority, this country is going to go away.
[01:15:44.977 --> 01:15:48.678]  Well, I'll tell you, this DU issue, Jim, explains it all.
[01:15:49.639 --> 01:16:04.644]  When, in the 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s, I've researched the entire history of it, interviewed all the experts, not just Doug Rockey, who's the top expert, literally wrote the book for the Pentagon in the mid-90s on it, and the previous reports in the 80s, physicists, you name it.
[01:16:06.405 --> 01:16:08.626]  You know, what a couple PhDs.
[01:16:09.981 --> 01:16:11.262]  They would never let him use it.
[01:16:11.282 --> 01:16:14.323]  They had it as a byproduct of making atomic and hydrogen bombs.
[01:16:15.384 --> 01:16:16.564]  They were going to have to store it.
[01:16:18.365 --> 01:16:25.029]  And it wasn't up until the 90s or so that they went ahead, kind of like it took three tries for Rumsfeld to get aspartame approved.
[01:16:25.649 --> 01:16:27.310]  In the 60s, 70s, they failed.
[01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:28.150]  He got it approved in 1980.
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:33.182]  Very toxic, but nothing compared to DU.
[01:16:33.782 --> 01:16:44.831]  But the point is, is that by the early 90s, they just went ahead and started using it as forklift ballast, aircraft ballast, weapons system, you know, tips, armor piercing, all of this.
[01:16:45.854 --> 01:16:54.818]  But previous to that, they said you can never use this because it ignites in the barrel and it gives people slow-kill dosages to use any of it.
[01:16:55.499 --> 01:16:57.280]  Now it's used at proving grounds everywhere.
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:03.743]  Now it's used all over the place and it shows all these people that claim all day how they love the troops.
[01:17:03.823 --> 01:17:08.225]  And don't say the war is wrong or I'll punch you in the nose.
[01:17:09.185 --> 01:17:11.526]  You know, don't say that
[01:17:13.087 --> 01:17:19.209]  That killing somebody for oil or whatever is wrong, or I'll punch you in the nose.
[01:17:20.409 --> 01:17:21.629]  Our troops were all patriotic.
[01:17:21.669 --> 01:17:22.290]  They want war.
[01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:23.070]  No, they don't.
[01:17:23.110 --> 01:17:27.471]  That's why CNN cut the feed when that guy in uniform was up there talking about that.
[01:17:27.531 --> 01:17:28.571]  He's like, well, you're a hero.
[01:17:28.611 --> 01:17:31.332]  You've been in for 10 years, two tours, highly decorated.
[01:17:31.352 --> 01:17:33.093]  They said, yeah, and I don't want this war.
[01:17:33.133 --> 01:17:34.013]  Boom, they cut the feed.
[01:17:34.053 --> 01:17:36.374]  Now we found other incidents where they do the same thing.
[01:17:37.054 --> 01:17:41.115]  That's because they want this image that you support the troops by treating them like garbage.
[01:17:41.815 --> 01:17:44.958]  And they can find people that kind of buy into all this and will go along with it.
[01:17:45.018 --> 01:17:51.603]  But it is a scourge on the military and we have a responsibility to make sure DU is not used.
[01:17:51.623 --> 01:17:53.105]  God bless you and I appreciate your call.
[01:17:54.346 --> 01:17:55.687]  Stephen Illinois, you're on the air.
[01:17:55.727 --> 01:17:56.067]  Go ahead.
[01:17:56.087 --> 01:17:56.628]  Thanks for holding.
[01:17:58.249 --> 01:18:00.571]  Okay Alex, two quick history lessons.
[01:18:01.198 --> 01:18:08.845]  One might want to delve into pre-World War II Germany and see how the squeeze play was being put on Hitler and the Nazis.
[01:18:09.266 --> 01:18:14.030]  And no wonder he come to such a high rise so solidly because the people had had enough.
[01:18:14.330 --> 01:18:17.113]  It's almost a blueprint of what's going on in this country today.
[01:18:17.533 --> 01:18:19.255]  Number two, you know,
[01:18:20.888 --> 01:18:23.509]  The United Nations was started in 45.
[01:18:23.949 --> 01:18:36.594]  They had this figured out, we didn't know it, that in 65 years, see, Roosevelt got us so we could retire at 65, and you add 65 years to 1945 and what do you got?
[01:18:36.614 --> 01:18:36.594]  2010.
[01:18:36.915 --> 01:18:39.195]  That's when they started grabbing all these pensions and everything.
[01:18:40.076 --> 01:18:44.958]  Oh sir, it was our Pentagon that set up the UN and they would use
[01:18:47.358 --> 01:18:55.865]  McCarthy to take people's rights, but when he figured out that our elite and our own government and our own Pentagon was funding the Communists, that's when they destroyed him.
[01:18:56.145 --> 01:18:57.666]  But now it's all been declassified.
[01:18:57.686 --> 01:18:58.567]  It was all true.
[01:18:58.907 --> 01:19:11.257]  Yes, the mega-robber barons wanted to destroy freedom, and they used America as the command base to do it while funding the Communists so that they could be the other side of it to create the illusion of choice.
[01:19:12.778 --> 01:19:13.199]  You bet.
[01:19:13.599 --> 01:19:15.921]  And the other historical fact, a little bit before your time,
[01:19:16.691 --> 01:19:19.592]  Uh, Ronald Reagan came in, and it was a race to the bottom.
[01:19:19.612 --> 01:19:21.852]  That's what got me arrested 32 years ago.
[01:19:21.872 --> 01:19:23.493]  Uh, what was going on?
[01:19:23.553 --> 01:19:29.654]  Deregulation, and they were going to ship industry offshore at taxpayers' expense on top of it.
[01:19:30.014 --> 01:19:43.938]  And what that ended up being, like today, is a hush money situation, because they're going to build up all these other countries that's already there, so we can go in with our military adventurism and steal their, uh, raw goods and everything.
[01:19:44.538 --> 01:19:48.661]  That's the sound of your door being kicked in by an intruder with a single kick.
[01:20:07.870 --> 01:20:13.054]  That's the sound of the same door now protected by the Door Sentinel at MySafeDoor.com.

[01:20:32.157 --> 01:20:36.540]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:42.424]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.

[01:23:56.110 --> 01:23:58.752]  Atwood Rope, working to keep the world tied together.
[01:24:06.437 --> 01:24:25.663]  Yeah, people get into these love affairs with Ronald Reagan, and I've studied Ronald Reagan in depth.
[01:24:25.803 --> 01:24:29.684]  He wasn't a bad person individually, but he was in over his depth.
[01:24:29.724 --> 01:24:32.604]  I mean, they would roll him up to the podium with his cue cards, and that was it.
[01:24:33.005 --> 01:24:34.125]  George Herbert Walker Bush,
[01:24:35.407 --> 01:24:36.929]  Was running things from behind the scenes.
[01:24:37.629 --> 01:24:43.336]  And Reagan, when he was actually running, criticized George Herbert Walker Bush and said he's a trilateralist, he's a New World Order person.
[01:24:43.796 --> 01:24:53.247]  We have those clips, by the way, in the film Invisible Empire that I produced and Jason Burms directed that is available at Infowars.com if you'd like to get that film and also support us.
[01:24:56.923 --> 01:25:00.025]  You know, I always get lectured by so-called conservatives.
[01:25:00.045 --> 01:25:02.087]  They're like, oh, NAFTA and GATT are great.
[01:25:02.327 --> 01:25:03.608]  Oh, open borders are great.
[01:25:04.588 --> 01:25:06.490]  Oh, this makes us more competitive.
[01:25:07.010 --> 01:25:07.390]  Really?
[01:25:07.550 --> 01:25:20.819]  To give General Motors 25-plus billion dollars in the first bailout they got, and they used almost all of it to move plants to Brazil, China, and Eastern Europe?
[01:25:25.102 --> 01:25:26.243]  I mean, that all happened.
[01:25:29.312 --> 01:25:38.617]  How is giving $16 trillion and another $10 trillion on top of that to the Federal Reserve and then they get caught lying and saying we didn't give any of it to private individuals or foreign banks.
[01:25:38.877 --> 01:25:50.624]  Turns out most of it, 60 plus percent went to it, including MSNBC, your tax money, from the government to the private Federal Reserve to have Rachel Maddow sit up there and talk about banning our Second Amendment.
[01:25:51.024 --> 01:25:51.885]  I mean, it's treason!
[01:25:53.446 --> 01:25:57.228]  It's a bunch of foreign corporations that wrap their tyranny in a flag
[01:26:00.991 --> 01:26:02.791]  And here's an example, USA Today.
[01:26:03.972 --> 01:26:05.332]  This stuff's just in the open now.
[01:26:06.332 --> 01:26:09.013]  GM deal moves electric car development to China.
[01:26:09.173 --> 01:26:09.833]  A shakedown.
[01:26:11.314 --> 01:26:13.694]  I mean, even USA Today sounds like my show.
[01:26:13.714 --> 01:26:16.275]  Because that's what it is.
[01:26:20.816 --> 01:26:24.017]  And there goes your tax money that you paid for.
[01:26:24.397 --> 01:26:25.497]  No one will buy these electric cars.
[01:26:25.517 --> 01:26:27.637]  They sold like 10,000 or something last time I checked.
[01:26:28.138 --> 01:26:29.498]  They said they were going to sell millions of them.
[01:26:33.126 --> 01:26:35.927]  And it's all going overseas.
[01:26:38.127 --> 01:26:51.451]  I mean, as if we can't compete with Chinese slave labor and them chaining their kids while they're going into work to power poles because they won't pay them enough to even live in many areas.
[01:26:52.071 --> 01:26:52.751]  This is on record.
[01:26:53.993 --> 01:26:57.916]  Guys, type in Chinese workers chaining children to lampposts.
[01:26:58.637 --> 01:26:59.798]  It'll pull up news articles on it.
[01:26:59.838 --> 01:27:00.598]  People won't believe that.
[01:27:01.299 --> 01:27:03.181]  It's like selling political dissidents organs.
[01:27:03.901 --> 01:27:05.182]  This is the race to the bottom.
[01:27:05.442 --> 01:27:10.186]  You don't build up China and build up the rest of the world by having the lowest standards ever known.
[01:27:10.507 --> 01:27:13.429]  You suck everything down with it, as Ross Perot explained.
[01:27:14.330 --> 01:27:15.451]  Let me explain how it works.
[01:27:15.911 --> 01:27:19.274]  Canadian workers are paid on average about $10 an hour more than we were.
[01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:25.115]  Soon as they got rid of any type of tariffs or controls, their jobs moved to the United States.
[01:27:25.616 --> 01:27:29.360]  Now, we opened this up to Mexico.
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:30.441]  Two things are going to happen.
[01:27:31.062 --> 01:27:35.607]  The workers are going to come up here and drive down the wages, but even more, they're going to go to Mexico and drive them down.
[01:27:35.867 --> 01:27:38.210]  You're going to have a giant sucking sound, but that's only for a while.
[01:27:39.636 --> 01:27:45.617]  Then what's going to happen is, you're going to have the jobs go to India and to China.
[01:27:46.338 --> 01:27:48.018]  Mexico's going to be destroyed by this.
[01:27:48.458 --> 01:27:51.899]  All the people down there, the farmers that are sustainable, have a good way of life.
[01:27:52.159 --> 01:27:53.959]  This is going to destroy Mexico.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.400]  There's 15 million people right now in Mexico City.
[01:27:57.980 --> 01:28:04.862]  I predict within a decade it'll be 30 million being forced up there to work in factories and then coming to the United States and being given welfare.
[01:28:05.950 --> 01:28:12.355]  This will destroy the entire global system, but in the short term it will allow major corporations to have larger profits.
[01:28:13.195 --> 01:28:26.525]  It is not free or fair trade to allow China to have no environmental standards, no workers' compensation, no Social Security, and to pay tax incentives to move American jobs over there.
[01:28:27.186 --> 01:28:30.488]  This country is going to be completely destroyed, economically.
[01:28:31.149 --> 01:28:31.869]  Now that's the facts.
[01:28:33.110 --> 01:28:35.112]  Al Gore starts laughing at him on Larry King Live.
[01:28:36.391 --> 01:28:37.712]  We have clips of that in Fall of the Republic.
[01:28:38.793 --> 01:28:40.514]  And he goes, haha, very funny.
[01:28:41.274 --> 01:28:44.196]  This will double our jobs, Larry.
[01:28:44.216 --> 01:28:47.899]  I mean, that Nelly con artist.
[01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:54.783]  And Ross Perot's getting madder and madder because, you can say what you want about Ross Perot, he was right on those subjects and cared about this country.
[01:28:56.444 --> 01:29:01.328]  Then they called him a conspiracy theorist when he came out and said, I've been told my wife and daughters will be killed.
[01:29:02.268 --> 01:29:02.729]  That's fine.
[01:29:02.769 --> 01:29:03.789]  This country's in a lot of trouble.
[01:29:03.829 --> 01:29:04.350]  I'm dropping out.
[01:29:05.606 --> 01:29:06.787]  They're like, oh, that's ridiculous.
[01:29:06.827 --> 01:29:08.949]  George Herbert Walker Bush wouldn't threaten him.
[01:29:16.976 --> 01:29:18.377]  Stop being naive!
[01:29:18.437 --> 01:29:22.400]  The people that run our government and our country do not care about us.
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:24.162]  Now, Roberts is going to be on for one segment.
[01:29:24.915 --> 01:29:27.976]  And I'll get to your calls ahead of the next guest in that little segment, the one after that.
[01:29:27.996 --> 01:29:31.556]  I'll get to Jason, George, Brian, Carter, Mike, and others.
[01:29:32.136 --> 01:29:37.718]  We're going to hit economic news, world military news, police state news with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:29:38.178 --> 01:29:39.278]  Straight ahead, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:39.298 --> 01:29:42.459]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:29:42.499 --> 01:29:48.980]  We're carrying the new film, A Noble Lie, exposing Oklahoma City as a staged op and a new... Well, I'll tell you about it when we come back.
[01:29:50.629 --> 01:29:53.634]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.555 --> 01:29:57.280]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:05.416 --> 01:30:06.317]  Tyranny is here.
[01:30:06.677 --> 01:30:10.219]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:30:10.539 --> 01:30:12.820]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:18.283]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:30:18.704 --> 01:30:24.987]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:25.367 --> 01:30:30.931]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:30:31.351 --> 01:30:35.013]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:30:35.513 --> 01:30:39.494]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:30:39.794 --> 01:30:45.735]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:45.755 --> 01:30:48.716]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:30:49.296 --> 01:30:50.696]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:30:51.276 --> 01:30:51.776]  It's here.

[01:31:03.869 --> 01:31:08.890]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:31:09.170 --> 01:31:10.531]  Saving means to make money.
[01:31:10.711 --> 01:31:19.494]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:31:20.234 --> 01:31:27.340]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:35.386]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:31:35.766 --> 01:31:40.690]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[01:32:04.981 --> 01:32:06.864]  Record foreclosure rates for homes.
[01:32:07.264 --> 01:32:08.766]  If not yours, your neighbor's.
[01:32:09.127 --> 01:32:11.650]  Thankful for the unemployment check since you were laid off.
[01:32:12.090 --> 01:32:18.579]  And placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[01:32:19.079 --> 01:32:22.301]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?
[01:32:22.321 --> 01:32:27.243]  The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control.
[01:32:27.523 --> 01:32:28.784]  Your greatest dependency.
[01:32:29.064 --> 01:32:30.105]  Your food supply.
[01:32:30.465 --> 01:32:34.327]  Make 2012 the year you take control by getting prepared.
[01:32:34.667 --> 01:32:38.549]  eFoods Direct introduces the best way to build your food supply in the
[01:32:38.609 --> 01:32:38.749]  You bet!
[01:33:06.039 --> 01:33:15.720]  Alright, I've gotten a few calls about this and I know that Jesse Ventura has already left the United States.
[01:33:20.814 --> 01:33:28.099]  But I'm going to try to get a hold of him in Mexico and find out about this because I'm here reading about this even on the Blaze website.
[01:33:28.759 --> 01:33:31.121]  It's just one of the many places that's running with it.
[01:33:31.902 --> 01:33:34.904]  And even the people commenting there say, this guy's selling a book.
[01:33:35.644 --> 01:33:36.925]  This sounds really weird.
[01:33:36.945 --> 01:33:38.666]  It comes off strange.
[01:33:39.227 --> 01:33:45.971]  The Opie and Anthony show, a show I've been a guest on before, I'd have them as a guest here, but they cuss so much.
[01:33:45.991 --> 01:33:47.092]  We're on FCC stations.
[01:33:47.112 --> 01:33:47.572]  They're just on XM.
[01:33:49.597 --> 01:34:15.976]  uh... this uh... younger navy seal uh... chris kyle says that uh... he was at a bar uh... and uh... that jesse ventura was there talking about how the war is a bunch of murderers and wrong so he punched him in the nose and ran away so the police wouldn't arrest him and he's acting like it's kind of joking around uh... very very strange and and and separately
[01:34:17.330 --> 01:34:29.221]  Jesse, you know, called two weeks ago and said, hey, they're running a national news story on Fox and TMZ that I was, the police pulled me over for rubberneck and for tailgating in California.
[01:34:29.241 --> 01:34:32.804]  And by the way, this was supposedly the night before he called us from Minnesota.
[01:34:32.824 --> 01:34:35.106]  He goes, you know, I've been in a federal lawsuit.
[01:34:35.126 --> 01:34:36.608]  I haven't flown in 15 months.
[01:34:37.876 --> 01:34:39.417]  And later TMZ had to retract it.
[01:34:40.017 --> 01:34:46.741]  So they said he's, the police pull him over, he's tailgating people, and now, it looks like a psy-op, now he's in a bar.
[01:34:46.761 --> 01:34:49.103]  By the way, Ventura hasn't drunk alcohol in decades.
[01:34:49.983 --> 01:35:03.511]  And it's funny, when I was out in Vegas with him, you know, shooting the TV show a few months ago, we were driving around, Jesse and his wife and I, and he was talking about baloney in the press, and he's like, yeah!
[01:35:05.244 --> 01:35:10.447]  They're always putting out these stories that I was in a bar in California or a bar in Nevada and I got knocked out.
[01:35:10.467 --> 01:35:11.408]  And he goes, it's weird.
[01:35:11.808 --> 01:35:14.830]  He goes, Alex, do you think, Alex, do you think that's a PSYOP?
[01:35:15.677 --> 01:35:18.539]  And then, of course, he called into the show and he goes, Alex, I'm very angry.
[01:35:18.599 --> 01:35:19.460]  I may have to sue them.
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:20.640]  I was not in California.
[01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:21.201]  I have proof.
[01:35:21.261 --> 01:35:21.681]  I'm here.
[01:35:23.002 --> 01:35:24.083]  They say I did this.
[01:35:24.343 --> 01:35:29.646]  And now they've got this currently, I guess, active, or he just got out, sniper.
[01:35:30.367 --> 01:35:31.848]  I guess he's been over there shooting Iraqis.
[01:35:32.888 --> 01:35:36.731]  And it's so manly and tough, the disheveled, starving people.
[01:35:37.572 --> 01:35:45.457]  And he's all laughing and joking on this show about punching Ventura in the nose because Ventura's saying the war's wrong and then running away.
[01:35:48.525 --> 01:35:49.848]  I mean, very bizarre.
[01:35:49.949 --> 01:35:51.332]  So people are asking me about it.
[01:35:52.622 --> 01:35:55.624]  I've got Ventura's wife's cell phone, but I think he's already gone into Mexico.
[01:35:55.984 --> 01:35:57.525]  I'm going to call him at the end of the show today.
[01:35:58.366 --> 01:35:58.546]  Okay?
[01:35:58.566 --> 01:35:59.567]  And I'm going to find out about this.
[01:35:59.607 --> 01:36:06.671]  But if I put two and two together, I think he told me about this and was going, I just ought to sue these people.
[01:36:06.892 --> 01:36:08.292]  But that was before this was ever out.
[01:36:08.953 --> 01:36:09.874]  And he will sue people.
[01:36:09.914 --> 01:36:11.254]  So it's not true.
[01:36:11.595 --> 01:36:12.795]  So I'm going to find out what's going on.
[01:36:12.815 --> 01:36:15.357]  But there's a clear psyop going on.
[01:36:15.617 --> 01:36:19.860]  Ron Paul, that's on CNN, will he apologize for a Twitter sent from his account?
[01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:22.122]  And the Twitter's like, yeah, Huntsman's an idiot.
[01:36:22.882 --> 01:36:27.344]  And Paul's like, no, somebody unauthorized sent that, and since he apologized, that's a big deal.
[01:36:27.604 --> 01:36:29.244]  Oh my gosh, they sent a Twitter out.
[01:36:29.905 --> 01:36:34.566]  Ron Paul, you know, ate a hamburger once, or he got a crooked toenail.
[01:36:34.946 --> 01:36:40.488]  I mean, it's just as much ado about nothing, PSYOPs, and we're going to look into it.
[01:36:41.529 --> 01:36:45.150]  But even the people on Glenn Beck's side are not buying it, and that's just one of the places.
[01:36:45.190 --> 01:36:47.451]  Dallas newspapers have got it, D Magazine's got it.
[01:36:48.511 --> 01:36:53.174]  And we'll look into it and give you the breaking intel on that front.
[01:36:53.634 --> 01:37:02.299]  Up at DrudgeReport.com, they have our article, DHS officers armed with semi-automatic setup unannounced ID checkpoint.
[01:37:02.319 --> 01:37:04.400]  Oh, by the way, again, Ventura doesn't drink.
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:10.565]  That was a story about, I don't even drink, I'm at a bar, I'm knocked out, I, I, who are these people?
[01:37:11.105 --> 01:37:21.073]  I think it's a PSYOP, but DHS officers armed with semi-automatic setup, unannounced ID checkpoint, in Florida, I mean, with machine guns, so...
[01:37:21.894 --> 01:37:24.175]  We'll be looking at that after Dr. Roberts leaves us.
[01:37:24.375 --> 01:37:28.116]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is a best-selling author, former editor at the Wall Street Journal.
[01:37:28.516 --> 01:37:32.437]  He has a new great website they've launched, paulcraigroberts.org.
[01:37:32.897 --> 01:37:41.400]  He was the head of policy at Treasury, number two position under Ronald Reagan, and is the father of Reaganomics, and he's recognized as one of the top ten economists out there.
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:43.761]  We won't go over all of his laurels.
[01:37:44.301 --> 01:37:48.524]  Well, Alex, you know, it's the murder, the public murder of the United States Constitution in full public view.
[01:38:14.747 --> 01:38:18.729]  By both parties in Congress, both houses, and by the President.
[01:38:19.550 --> 01:38:20.951]  And this is an amazing thing.
[01:38:21.891 --> 01:38:32.478]  When they publicly repeal the Constitution and the Bill of Rights in a piece of legislation that has no justification whatsoever.
[01:38:33.663 --> 01:38:59.906]  You know, you could understand something like that, Alex, if every day a half a dozen shopping malls were blowing up, if people standing in the airports waiting to clear airport security, if bombs were going off in the lines, if terrorists were running in and spraying the crowd with automatic weapons, you know, if the neocons were being assassinated in their homes,
[01:39:01.287 --> 01:39:07.972]  If all of this was happening, one could understand these kinds of really desperate measures.
[01:39:08.492 --> 01:39:29.389]  But when nothing whatsoever is happening, despite the fact the United States has been bombing and murdering Muslims in six or more countries for the last ten years, there hasn't been a single domestic act of terrorism in the United States since 9-11, and you and I know what we think about that event.
[01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:40.554]  So the whole thing, you see, has no justification and people just sit there and they've accepted the public murder of the United States Constitution.
[01:39:40.594 --> 01:39:41.394]  What does this mean?
[01:39:42.235 --> 01:39:47.176]  You know, the Constitution is the result of about 800 years of struggle.
[01:39:49.173 --> 01:39:51.455]  We inherited it from the British.
[01:39:52.035 --> 01:39:58.199]  You know, the Bill of Rights, this was something they achieved over a long period of time of struggle.
[01:39:58.279 --> 01:39:58.980]  We inherited it.
[01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:11.669]  We enshrined it in the Constitution so that there would be limits on the government and so the government would be accountable to law and could not just arbitrarily do things to people.
[01:40:12.301 --> 01:40:14.724]  Well, we've just allowed them to destroy this.
[01:40:15.365 --> 01:40:17.367]  And there's no objection.
[01:40:17.728 --> 01:40:29.161]  Of all the candidates, all the visible candidates, you know, the Democrats and the Republicans, contending for the presidency, only Ron Paul has made an issue of this.
[01:40:30.794 --> 01:40:33.055]  What does this mean about us as a country?
[01:40:33.575 --> 01:40:55.406]  So if we're going to let them murder the Constitution, then sure, we're going to let the Department of Homeland Security feel us up when we go through airports, porno scanners, post armed guards at Social Security offices, stop cars and trucks on the nation's highways and search them without warrants.
[01:40:56.586 --> 01:40:57.747]  This is a police state.
[01:40:57.787 --> 01:41:08.315]  I don't even think Hitler had a police state this thorough going or one that whose foundation has been so well prepared over the last 10 years.
[01:41:09.575 --> 01:41:15.199]  So that's what's on my mind, you know, who's doing anything about it other than the ACLU.
[01:41:15.279 --> 01:41:25.647]  Now I know you talk about it, I talk about it, but we don't have any way of actually doing anything about it and the people seem to be accepting it.
[01:41:26.502 --> 01:41:41.026]  Well, obviously, throughout history, governments that massively erode liberties in the name of safety, it's always that corrupt government system that is the true, ultimate threat, much more so than some foggy, staged, fake terror threat.
[01:41:41.706 --> 01:41:45.387]  But here's the $64 million question that I want your perspective on, Dr. Roberts.
[01:41:46.307 --> 01:41:58.797]  Why are they accelerating internet censorship and admitting it's censorship even when the 80 inventors of the internet come out and say it's that Chinese-style communist, you know, selective kill switch?
[01:41:59.437 --> 01:42:05.882]  Why are they admitting torture, NDAA, wireless wiretapping, all of this?
[01:42:06.002 --> 01:42:11.646]  Why are they moving so quickly right now and so openly?
[01:42:11.787 --> 01:42:12.847]  What are they planning?
[01:42:13.168 --> 01:42:14.569]  What are they doing this ahead of?
[01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:17.221]  Yes, that's a good question.
[01:42:17.301 --> 01:42:24.265]  Obviously, they want to shut us up and stop the only access we have to any real information, which is on the Internet.
[01:42:24.825 --> 01:42:25.906]  So what are they planning?
[01:42:25.946 --> 01:42:28.968]  Well, they may be preparing for economic catastrophe.
[01:42:29.008 --> 01:42:31.389]  There's obviously not an economic recovery.
[01:42:31.409 --> 01:42:41.635]  There cannot be an economic recovery when you've moved the entire manufacturing sector offshore, along with so many of the middle class professional skill jobs.
[01:42:42.671 --> 01:42:46.675]  So they've run out of the ability to keep the economy going with consumer debt.
[01:42:47.095 --> 01:42:48.056]  So there's no recovery.
[01:42:48.096 --> 01:42:49.457]  What does that mean for the deficit?
[01:42:49.497 --> 01:42:50.378]  It's going to be bigger.
[01:42:50.739 --> 01:42:52.660]  The unemployment is going to be worse.
[01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:55.003]  There's going to be more protests, more hardship.
[01:42:56.664 --> 01:42:58.566]  And the financial situation is not
[01:43:00.167 --> 01:43:00.307]  Yes.
[01:43:17.938 --> 01:43:22.002]  They now talk about their war plans for China.
[01:43:22.722 --> 01:43:25.625]  So they're preparing big things for us.
[01:43:26.406 --> 01:43:28.988]  Economic collapse at home, more wars abroad.
[01:43:29.709 --> 01:43:42.621]  And they want to be sure that we simply can't use the Internet and the various kinds of social information networks to get information or to oppose these developments.
[01:43:42.921 --> 01:43:43.782]  That's right, doctor.
[01:43:43.842 --> 01:43:45.663]  You just put your finger directly on it.
[01:43:46.203 --> 01:43:55.250]  That's why, and I'm not a fan of the Communist Chinese, but the point is, their president came out, as you know, a month ago and said, we're preparing for war with the U.S.
[01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:58.292]  It looks like they're going to try to encircle us.
[01:43:58.392 --> 01:44:02.095]  The bases are being set up, so prepare for war with the United States.
[01:44:02.816 --> 01:44:07.839]  The Russians, who've not had an aggressive posture, are now having to say, okay, they're getting ready for war with us.
[01:44:07.879 --> 01:44:08.320]  Get ready.
[01:44:10.003 --> 01:44:26.556]  It's going to be hard for the Russians to do that because they have foolishly allowed these non-governmental organizations that are funded by the American Endowment for Democracy to come in and muck around in the elections and organize street protests.
[01:44:27.476 --> 01:44:37.244]  And the Russians now are being seduced with membership in the World Trade Organization so that we are, I don't mean you and I, but so that Washington
[01:44:38.104 --> 01:44:40.166]  Or whoever is pulling all the strings.
[01:44:41.387 --> 01:44:45.811]  So that they now have access to Russian leaders that they can purchase with money.
[01:44:46.852 --> 01:44:49.354]  That's the way the United States controls the world.
[01:44:49.414 --> 01:44:52.297]  It buys the leaders of all the other governments.
[01:44:52.898 --> 01:44:54.759]  Now it's unable to do that in China.
[01:44:55.843 --> 01:44:56.804]  And in Iran.
[01:44:57.084 --> 01:44:59.626]  But everywhere else it seems to have access.
[01:45:00.386 --> 01:45:05.009]  And basically just purchases the leadership of those countries.
[01:45:05.630 --> 01:45:12.714]  And so that the leaders of those countries no longer represent their own country, their own people, they represent Washington's interests.
[01:45:13.335 --> 01:45:17.778]  I mean, why else is NATO fighting American wars in Central Asia?
[01:45:19.158 --> 01:45:20.119]  Or North Africa?
[01:45:20.900 --> 01:45:22.481]  There's nothing to do with NATO.
[01:45:23.956 --> 01:45:27.297]  Well, they want part of that $500 billion in opium coming out of Afghanistan a year.
[01:45:27.337 --> 01:45:36.041]  But looking at this, now openly having the aircraft carriers straight over Hormuz, Iran, threatening, don't bring your carriers back.
[01:45:36.641 --> 01:45:36.881]  U.S.
[01:45:36.901 --> 01:45:41.643]  troops arriving in Israel for what Israel calls a deployment, not a drill.
[01:45:43.103 --> 01:45:46.344]  Just, just crazy, crazy things happening.
[01:45:46.484 --> 01:45:50.825]  And I think you also hit the nail on the head again when you pointed out whoever's pulling the strings.
[01:45:51.125 --> 01:45:52.386]  This is not America.
[01:45:52.426 --> 01:45:53.786]  This is not our government.
[01:45:54.106 --> 01:45:58.307]  This is this global corporate consortium that controls the United States.
[01:45:58.327 --> 01:45:59.508]  It's like it controls others.
[01:46:00.388 --> 01:46:01.688]  And so what is the endgame?
[01:46:01.728 --> 01:46:06.850]  I mean, as an economist with what's happening in Europe, the acceleration of currency devaluations
[01:46:08.790 --> 01:46:14.471]  I mean, if you were to step into their shoes, their mindset, what do you think their method of their madness is?
[01:46:15.852 --> 01:46:24.654]  Well, you see, the European banks were ruined by Wall Street, all the junk securities that Wall Street sold them under false pretenses.
[01:46:25.174 --> 01:46:26.794]  So that damaged them.
[01:46:27.174 --> 01:46:33.856]  And then, they now, on top of that, they have this sovereign debt crisis, you know, the Greek debt, the Italian debt.
[01:46:35.797 --> 01:46:48.767]  What, uh, what weird, what, what Washington is doing, or whoever's pulling the strings, is using the hype of the European, uh, sovereign debt crisis to strengthen the dollar.
[01:46:50.140 --> 01:47:00.689]  Drive down the euro and drive down gold and silver and strengthen the dollar so that they can pull off this next big war front that they've got planned.
[01:47:01.290 --> 01:47:08.536]  So, and the reason they're putting American troops in Israel is that if they give Israel the green light,
[01:47:09.637 --> 01:47:13.440]  To attack Iran, and Iran retaliates.
[01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:24.667]  The retaliation will probably hit some of the American troops who have been stationed around Israel, and then that gives Washington a reason to join in the war.
[01:47:24.867 --> 01:47:30.932]  I was about to say, I have the reporter, they're peppering them at all of the main bases the Iranians are sure to hit.
[01:47:31.632 --> 01:47:32.473]  Yeah, right.
[01:47:32.833 --> 01:47:35.675]  So Washington can say, oh they killed our soldiers.
[01:47:37.123 --> 01:47:39.305]  And be off to war.
[01:47:39.405 --> 01:47:44.349]  So I think that all of that is what's in the cards.
[01:47:44.490 --> 01:47:53.517]  And people will sit without good information, unless the whole country watches you, a few other places.
[01:47:54.498 --> 01:47:58.482]  They'll sit without good information and be sucked into another hoax.
[01:47:59.803 --> 01:48:03.086]  And it's getting more and more dangerous because
[01:48:05.245 --> 01:48:14.592]  I think the Chinese and the Russians didn't get too disturbed about Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:48:14.632 --> 01:48:22.278]  They may have seen it as a way of letting the Americans get themselves into a mess and bankrupt the government's budget and so on.
[01:48:23.019 --> 01:48:25.381]  But it's now getting closer and closer to them.
[01:48:25.421 --> 01:48:30.144]  You see, as we've talked before, the overthrow of Qaddafi,
[01:48:31.065 --> 01:48:35.966]  The war against Libya, this was directed at the Chinese oil investments in eastern Libya.
[01:48:36.826 --> 01:48:42.367]  The set-up of Syria is directed at the Russian naval base in Syria.
[01:48:43.228 --> 01:48:58.991]  And if they hit Iran, as it certainly seems they intend to do, with all their rhetoric, this also threatens the Chinese investments in Iran, and it is too close to Russia's borders.
[01:49:00.126 --> 01:49:13.211]  So they're now really risking some kind of a nuclear encounter here with two powers, either one of which can blow away the whole world.
[01:49:13.291 --> 01:49:15.592]  And by the way, with the Georgia conflict, as you know, sir, on 888.
[01:49:16.832 --> 01:49:31.662]  The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was on European TV but not here, top story in Europe, rolled up mobile missiles and said on TV, okay, we're going to have to attack you with medium-range missiles because NATO aircraft were landing to back it up.
[01:49:32.162 --> 01:49:33.903]  And what other response do you do?
[01:49:34.223 --> 01:49:38.565]  This show, and it turned out, Cy Hirsch discovered Dick Cheney was probing Russia.
[01:49:38.945 --> 01:49:42.086]  I mean, these are just crazy people that get off on this stuff.
[01:49:42.347 --> 01:49:44.067]  They already run the whole stinking world.
[01:49:44.347 --> 01:49:47.529]  Why do they have to just keep grabbing and grabbing and grabbing?
[01:49:48.649 --> 01:49:51.811]  You know, they've been mad ever since.
[01:49:52.874 --> 01:49:54.135]  I don't
[01:50:11.261 --> 01:50:22.417]  That the Russians would not have the wherewithal to respond, but that they were quickly gaining and that we needed to strike right away to negate Soviet power.
[01:50:23.058 --> 01:50:23.999]  And Kennedy nixed it.
[01:50:25.242 --> 01:50:27.063]  And they've been angry ever since.
[01:50:27.724 --> 01:50:33.287]  And they got more and more angry about the Vietnam War, about losing the Vietnam War.
[01:50:33.467 --> 01:50:34.848]  Tell you what, doctor, one more segment.
[01:50:34.868 --> 01:50:37.289]  Let's finish up there and look at the economy and the outlook there.
[01:50:37.309 --> 01:50:40.851]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, and he's launched a new website, and it's a really nice one.
[01:50:41.652 --> 01:50:47.235]  We'll give you that address right now, and when we come back, excited to see his work proliferating out there.
[01:50:47.395 --> 01:50:49.157]  PaulCraigRoberts.org.

[01:51:01.414 --> 01:51:02.315]  What happened, man?
[01:51:02.715 --> 01:51:06.398]  You used to be energetic, happy, and wow, did the ladies love you.
[01:51:06.718 --> 01:51:09.861]  Now, you fall asleep on the couch, irritable, and out of shape.
[01:51:10.181 --> 01:51:11.162]  Don't be that guy!

[01:51:45.390 --> 01:51:46.651]  Don't wait another day.
[01:51:47.011 --> 01:51:47.391]  Just call 1-800-497-8345.
[01:51:47.411 --> 01:51:47.612]  That's 1-800-497-8345.
[01:52:01.059 --> 01:52:02.221]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:52:02.501 --> 01:52:12.956]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[01:52:13.177 --> 01:52:17.263]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[01:52:17.603 --> 01:52:20.026]  But we can't do that without your help.
[01:52:20.346 --> 01:52:31.219]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[01:52:31.639 --> 01:52:34.783]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[01:52:35.103 --> 01:52:40.765]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[01:52:41.246 --> 01:52:50.750]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[01:52:51.130 --> 01:52:52.310]  The war is here.
[01:52:52.631 --> 01:52:54.051]  It's an info war.
[01:52:54.531 --> 01:52:56.472]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[01:53:03.038 --> 01:53:08.641]  In the event of an emergency, do you really trust Obama and the federal government to provide for you and your family?
[01:53:09.121 --> 01:53:17.786]  Modern-day emergencies like floods, tornadoes, earthquakes, snowstorms, terrorist attacks, or anything else can strike anywhere, leaving your family vulnerable.
[01:53:17.966 --> 01:53:21.028]  That's why you can't afford to be without emergency food supplies.
[01:53:21.348 --> 01:53:25.532]  If you're like most people, you know that you need emergency food supplies, but you keep putting it off.
[01:53:25.812 --> 01:53:32.919]  So, to help you, Ready Reserve Foods is offering a free sample kit of emergency food so you can test our food for yourself.
[01:53:33.039 --> 01:53:34.840]  The food really is free.

[01:53:51.256 --> 01:53:51.676]  Don't wait.
[01:53:51.776 --> 01:53:54.178]  Call now because the free sample kits are limited.
[01:53:54.298 --> 01:53:55.760]  So call 800-453-2202 or ready reserve foods .com.
[01:54:11.980 --> 01:54:13.901]  All right, final segment with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:54:13.921 --> 01:54:19.986]  We'll take some more of your calls and we have another guest coming up, a reporter to break down evidence of manipulation and tampering.
[01:54:20.326 --> 01:54:30.293]  By the way, we have Karl Rove, a clip coming up where he just talks about the fact they had a gentleman's agreement with all the key caucuses there and decided that Santorum came in second.
[01:54:30.333 --> 01:54:31.594]  Wait till I play that clip.
[01:54:31.614 --> 01:54:35.137]  I played it on the nightly news last night, but I'll get to that coming up in the next hour.
[01:54:36.348 --> 01:54:36.628]  Probably.
[01:55:01.465 --> 01:55:03.506]  Well, I think we kind of covered that.
[01:55:03.526 --> 01:55:04.767]  You wanted to get on to the economy.
[01:55:04.787 --> 01:55:05.627]  Yes, just briefly.
[01:55:06.587 --> 01:55:07.188]  What do you see there?
[01:55:07.928 --> 01:55:12.130]  Well, there can't be a recovery because the economy has been moved offshore.
[01:55:13.050 --> 01:55:14.751]  And we have very high unemployment.
[01:55:14.791 --> 01:55:17.713]  We have a huge employment deficit over the last 10 years.
[01:55:18.713 --> 01:55:33.405]  And so far the dollar is holding together because the government has been operating against the bullion markets and it's using all this hype about a European debt crisis to keep the euro down.
[01:55:34.866 --> 01:55:46.169]  But you've got to figure what do they do when the economy worsens, unemployment rises, the tax revenues fall more, the deficit gets bigger.
[01:55:46.209 --> 01:55:49.190]  They've got to be able to sell these bonds somewhere.
[01:55:49.470 --> 01:55:52.331]  And if there's no market for them, then the Federal Reserve buys them.
[01:55:52.351 --> 01:55:53.671]  That is, it monetizes them.
[01:55:53.731 --> 01:55:55.572]  It creates new money to pay for them.
[01:55:56.492 --> 01:56:08.658]  Sooner or later, all that new money will find its way into the economy and drive up prices, or else the constant monetization of debt will cause the rest of the world to give up on the dollar.
[01:56:09.519 --> 01:56:17.743]  And this, in my view, is the real check on Washington's power, or on the power of those pulling the strings.
[01:56:17.823 --> 01:56:24.767]  At some point, there's going to be too many dollar claims for the value of the dollar to support it.
[01:56:25.939 --> 01:56:28.120]  And it's going to bite the dust.
[01:56:28.321 --> 01:56:32.563]  And when that happens, so does the power of Washington.
[01:56:33.784 --> 01:56:46.471]  And I think that is a more likely thing to curtail the developments that we don't like than any sort of internal political reform.
[01:56:46.491 --> 01:56:48.413]  But they still have their nuclear weapons.
[01:56:49.598 --> 01:56:57.802]  And Israel has them, and in the final equation, that's what is being counted on here, is just holding everybody hostage.
[01:56:58.982 --> 01:57:04.945]  I'm actually in the process of writing about the economic outlook for this new year.
[01:57:05.565 --> 01:57:12.908]  I interrupted it to come onto your program, but this article will soon be posted on my site, paulcraigroberts.org.
[01:57:13.789 --> 01:57:16.750]  And if it's not up, it'll probably be up tomorrow.
[01:57:17.777 --> 01:57:20.338]  Assuming I'm able to finish writing it.
[01:57:21.178 --> 01:57:37.043]  And I'm going to go through all the aspects that have essentially destroyed the economic capability of the economy and ruined the prospect for at least 90% of the American population.
[01:57:39.044 --> 01:57:43.165]  And when your own government and your own corporations and your own pundits
[01:57:44.205 --> 01:57:46.426]  And your own economists do this to you.
[01:57:47.107 --> 01:57:51.029]  You really don't have a whole lot of reason to be loyal to them.
[01:57:51.489 --> 01:57:54.491]  Yes, and they're building a giant armed camp against us.
[01:57:54.911 --> 01:57:56.332]  They treat us like they're enemies.
[01:57:56.552 --> 01:58:01.275]  I mean, this is, or not even like they're enemies, like we're cattle and they're wolves.
[01:58:01.415 --> 01:58:02.836]  I guess we're just their prey.
[01:58:02.856 --> 01:58:09.620]  You can see this very well in the attitudes of local police toward local citizens.
[01:58:11.559 --> 01:58:16.461]  It is really out of control, and of course, those local police are helping along with the destruction of their own system.
[01:58:16.962 --> 01:58:18.022]  A lot of police are waking up.
[01:58:18.062 --> 01:58:20.803]  Dr. Roberts, congratulations on launching your site.
[01:58:21.444 --> 01:58:22.624]  We'll talk to you very soon.
[01:58:23.645 --> 01:58:24.245]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:58:24.345 --> 01:58:26.166]  I enjoy being with you.
[01:58:26.306 --> 01:58:26.766]  Enjoy having you.
[01:58:26.846 --> 01:58:27.586]  Have a great new year.
[01:58:28.047 --> 01:58:28.207]  Into 2012.
[01:58:29.227 --> 01:58:31.688]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be back in a moment.
[01:58:31.708 --> 01:58:33.029]  We've got a big show tonight, by the way.
[01:58:33.049 --> 01:58:39.432]  We're going to look at government-developed cancer viruses with the top expert, InfoWars Nightly News, 7 o'clock tonight.
[01:58:41.727 --> 01:58:43.592]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.257 --> 01:58:47.082]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.155 --> 01:58:55.378]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:55.698 --> 01:58:56.298]  Number 1.
[01:58:56.618 --> 01:58:59.760]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:59:00.041 --> 01:59:00.601]  Number 2.
[01:59:00.901 --> 01:59:05.444]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:05.784 --> 01:59:06.225]  It's true.
[01:59:06.525 --> 01:59:11.088]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:11.408 --> 01:59:11.948]  Number 3.
[01:59:12.228 --> 01:59:15.510]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:15.811 --> 01:59:19.513]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:19.713 --> 01:59:20.274]  Number 4.
[01:59:20.514 --> 01:59:22.876]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:23.276 --> 01:59:26.660]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:27.160]  Number 5.
[01:59:27.741 --> 01:59:31.664]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:31.884 --> 01:59:36.649]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:36.949 --> 01:59:40.971]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:41.111 --> 01:59:42.672]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:42.892 --> 01:59:44.973]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[01:59:47.755 --> 01:59:49.115]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:49.135 --> 01:59:54.998]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.953 --> 02:00:10.159]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:11.601]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.382 --> 02:00:13.263]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.924 --> 02:00:17.589]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.130 --> 02:00:22.196]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.738 --> 02:00:28.780]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're into the third hour here.
[02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:30.501]  I'm going to jam in some calls now.
[02:00:30.541 --> 02:00:31.401]  More coming up in the hour.
[02:00:31.441 --> 02:00:32.362]  We have a guest joining us.
[02:00:32.382 --> 02:00:34.823]  We're going to blitz through news and get his take on it.
[02:00:35.263 --> 02:00:36.284]  A first look at Iowa.
[02:00:36.684 --> 02:00:44.728]  I keep forgetting, guys, make sure you guys from John get that clip of the horse race clip with Karl Rove.
[02:00:44.768 --> 02:00:45.569]  He'll know which one it is.
[02:00:46.009 --> 02:00:47.210]  Looking at fraud in Iowa.
[02:00:47.990 --> 02:00:50.451]  Let's go ahead and talk to Carter in Michigan.
[02:00:50.491 --> 02:00:51.352]  Carter, you're on the air.
[02:00:53.420 --> 02:00:59.341]  Hey Alex, I just want to say me and a lot of my friends are really proud of what you're doing and we support you all the way, man.
[02:00:59.361 --> 02:01:00.062]  Well, thank you.
[02:01:00.102 --> 02:01:01.502]  Couldn't do it without your support, my friend.
[02:01:02.902 --> 02:01:06.203]  Okay, well I have a statement and a question as well.
[02:01:06.223 --> 02:01:10.124]  I just wanted to say that I was one of the, you know, I'm a young black guy.
[02:01:10.144 --> 02:01:12.705]  Been on board with Obama since 2008.
[02:01:12.785 --> 02:01:18.446]  I was one of those guys who jumped the Kool-Aid, you know, back then and, you know, thought he was going to be this miracle guy and
[02:01:19.156 --> 02:01:28.025]  All this stuff and over the years just watching his agenda, I really decided that I'm going to have to come on board with Ron Paul.
[02:01:28.565 --> 02:01:31.228]  After the NBAA, it really was the last straw for me.
[02:01:31.528 --> 02:01:33.090]  I really see what kind of guy he really is.
[02:01:34.656 --> 02:01:36.096]  Well, you know, it's good to be loyal.
[02:01:36.197 --> 02:01:41.458]  I mean, you see how bad somebody is like George W. Bush, and you want to believe.
[02:01:42.058 --> 02:01:45.579]  I mean, I early on wanted to believe Obama when he said end wars, torture, and all this.
[02:01:45.599 --> 02:01:52.960]  But then I saw the advisors he was getting and who was giving him money, and I said, folks, it's going to be a total con job.
[02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:53.681]  And we were right.
[02:01:54.041 --> 02:01:58.222]  But again, I'm sorry, go ahead and make your point.
[02:02:00.022 --> 02:02:03.243]  Yeah, it was one thing I was watching.
[02:02:04.165 --> 02:02:09.686]  On, uh, cable news, uh, we was at Al Sharpton's show on Tuesday, and they were talking about Ron Paul.
[02:02:10.226 --> 02:02:31.390]  And he was saying that, you know how the media's been trying to portray him as a racist and stuff, and he was saying that, uh, Ron Paul doesn't support the Civil Rights Act of 1965, and that, you know, Rosa Parks would still be on the bus, and that, that kind of threw me off, because I, you know, I've been looking into Ron Paul, and I really want to support him, you know, I'm thinking of donating to his campaign and everything, and now I'm thinking, like, wow, I mean, it's,
[02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:33.081]  Well, what's up with that?
[02:02:33.101 --> 02:02:37.443]  You know, I figured, you know, you would be a good guy to, you know, talk to about it and see what's going on.
[02:02:37.523 --> 02:02:41.585]  Well, the problem with it is I can pull up what he actually stands for.
[02:02:41.605 --> 02:02:44.486]  And Rand Paul said the same thing.
[02:02:44.526 --> 02:02:52.210]  They're saying federal legislation like that over states, that it should be the states, the states should all adopt
[02:02:52.910 --> 02:02:54.291]  Legislation like that.
[02:02:54.691 --> 02:02:56.812]  And he said that he would support it.
[02:02:56.872 --> 02:03:04.475]  He's saying it's unconstitutional, though, because they use that then for other things like the sexual harassment stuff and the rest of it.
[02:03:04.515 --> 02:03:07.117]  And now we've got the Fed setting up checkpoints on highways.
[02:03:07.957 --> 02:03:09.518]  And so that's a misrepresentation.
[02:03:09.538 --> 02:03:12.159]  I mean, I need to pull up his quotes where he explains it all.
[02:03:12.719 --> 02:03:16.464]  But no, I mean, it's like when they say he's against having a space program.
[02:03:16.965 --> 02:03:25.396]  No, he just explains that it should be done by the states, or that it's not part of a Navy or a military, and that it ends up being basically militarized.
[02:03:27.099 --> 02:03:30.562]  It's like they lie and say, well, he claims he's against earmarks, but he takes the money.
[02:03:30.983 --> 02:03:34.847]  He votes against the earmarks, but once the money comes to the district, of course, it gets distributed.
[02:03:35.768 --> 02:03:42.434]  So you can just, I'll guarantee you that's one of the frequently asked questions on the Ron Paul 2012 website.
[02:03:43.135 --> 02:03:44.436]  And you can go up there and look at that.
[02:03:44.456 --> 02:03:46.698]  And next time I have Ron Paul on, I'll bring that up to him.
[02:03:46.719 --> 02:03:48.520]  But no, that's one of their favorite things.
[02:03:49.701 --> 02:03:53.182]  Uh, is to say that, you know, they say he's against the federal government.
[02:03:53.222 --> 02:03:54.462]  He doesn't want women to vote.
[02:03:55.002 --> 02:03:56.363]  And it's basically just made up.
[02:03:57.143 --> 02:04:01.384]  Uh, and perhaps I should, um, problem is now here by the third hour.
[02:04:01.684 --> 02:04:04.004]  I cracked my sternum last weekend.
[02:04:04.225 --> 02:04:07.145]  So now I'm having, I'm kind of laboring here, folks.
[02:04:07.165 --> 02:04:09.626]  So I'm sorry, but we'll get this hour done and I'll be back tomorrow.
[02:04:09.666 --> 02:04:10.126]  Lord willing.
[02:04:10.806 --> 02:04:12.147]  I may not be able to do the nightly news tonight.
[02:04:12.187 --> 02:04:15.269]  I may have Rob Dew do it, but we'll see what happens with that.
[02:04:15.789 --> 02:04:20.532]  But I tell you what, I'll codify that information for you and get it out for you.
[02:04:20.552 --> 02:04:21.093]  How's that sound?
[02:04:22.514 --> 02:04:23.114]  Oh, great.
[02:04:23.154 --> 02:04:25.736]  You know, because pretty much I got my family on board.
[02:04:25.796 --> 02:04:37.183]  It seems like it's to the point where, you know, Ron Paul, you look at all the other candidates, and I mean, you look at Obama, it's like Ron Paul is the only way we gotta go, or else, you know, all hell's gonna break loose.
[02:04:38.868 --> 02:04:39.849]  You're right, my friend.
[02:04:40.990 --> 02:04:42.672]  You're absolutely right about that.
[02:04:42.732 --> 02:04:43.533]  Good to hear from you.
[02:04:44.654 --> 02:04:48.859]  Okay, we got a guest coming up, and we got a bunch more calls as well.
[02:04:48.899 --> 02:04:50.721]  This third hour is gonna be jam-packed.
[02:04:50.761 --> 02:04:53.364]  Wait till you hear this Karl Rove clip coming up.
[02:04:53.984 --> 02:04:56.267]  We'll be back tonight, 7 o'clock, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:05:03.083 --> 02:05:06.724]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:07.044 --> 02:05:15.186]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:05:15.906 --> 02:05:19.947]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:05:20.547 --> 02:05:31.349]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:05:31.989 --> 02:05:41.011]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:41.491 --> 02:05:46.572]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:05:46.933 --> 02:05:54.114]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:54.414 --> 02:05:56.815]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:06:02.347 --> 02:06:05.988]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:06:06.368 --> 02:06:09.369]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:06:09.609 --> 02:06:14.390]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:06:14.410 --> 02:06:20.632]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:06:20.792 --> 02:06:23.033]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:06:23.553 --> 02:06:23.873]  Tim Geithner?
[02:06:23.893 --> 02:06:24.114]  Bernanke?
[02:06:24.134 --> 02:06:24.694]  They're arsonists!
[02:06:24.714 --> 02:06:25.495]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:06:25.515 --> 02:06:27.858]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:06:42.475 --> 02:06:49.417]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:06:49.757 --> 02:06:58.940]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:07:00.953 --> 02:07:02.215]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:07:02.255 --> 02:07:07.602]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:07:07.842 --> 02:07:12.488]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:07:12.869 --> 02:07:13.269]  It's true.
[02:07:13.329 --> 02:07:17.895]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:07:18.416 --> 02:07:23.117]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:07:23.658 --> 02:07:30.560]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:07:30.760 --> 02:07:31.660]  And here's the best part.
[02:07:31.880 --> 02:07:38.242]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:07:38.562 --> 02:07:41.404]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:07:41.745 --> 02:07:43.646]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:07:43.966 --> 02:07:46.148]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:07:47.229 --> 02:07:49.231]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:07:49.991 --> 02:07:57.297]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:07:57.617 --> 02:08:00.079]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:08:01.720 --> 02:08:03.962]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.503 --> 02:08:07.285]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:19.429 --> 02:08:24.911]  Okay, for the rest of the hour, investigative journalist Greg Hunter is going to be our guest.
[02:08:24.951 --> 02:08:26.671]  We'll also take calls.
[02:08:26.731 --> 02:08:29.232]  Those of you that are holding, he can talk on any of these issues.
[02:08:29.892 --> 02:08:35.633]  I wanted to get him on to get his perspective on anomalies in Iowa because I know he's been looking into those and reporting on it.
[02:08:36.474 --> 02:08:44.636]  Since we even had Bev Harrison, who's really the permanent expert on election fraud, of blackboxvoting.org, we've learned even more.
[02:08:45.536 --> 02:08:51.117]  And in a moment after we get Greg's basic breakdown on this, I'm going to play a clip, an audio clip.
[02:08:51.758 --> 02:08:53.098]  It's a video clip for viewers.
[02:08:54.298 --> 02:09:09.382]  A little piece that John Bowne put together for the Nightly News where it shows Ron Paul, you know, up at first place until the magic wand of Karl Rove is introduced and then magically he gets pulled back to third place.
[02:09:10.262 --> 02:09:17.104]  And we're going to play that clip of Karl Rove here in a moment saying, oh, well, you know, some of the key precincts got lost or didn't show up.
[02:09:17.184 --> 02:09:20.105]  And, you know, there's missing people that had the votes.
[02:09:21.585 --> 02:09:22.485]  They don't know where they are.
[02:09:22.566 --> 02:09:27.167]  So they just had a gentleman's agreement and decided what level Santorum would go up to.
[02:09:27.387 --> 02:09:28.427]  And that's the final numbers.
[02:09:28.747 --> 02:09:30.968]  This is hours before these numbers were even released.
[02:09:32.298 --> 02:09:36.384]  This is the guy that called Florida for Bush when none of the other networks did.
[02:09:36.424 --> 02:09:38.186]  But when Karl Rove says so, it makes it so.
[02:09:38.727 --> 02:09:40.229]  And again, I'm not a fan of Al Gore.
[02:09:40.309 --> 02:09:41.351]  Facts are facts.
[02:09:43.013 --> 02:09:44.816]  So we'll get his take on this.
[02:09:44.836 --> 02:09:46.979]  And then I want to move into some other subject with Greg Hunter.
[02:09:47.399 --> 02:09:48.721]  The Iran situation.
[02:09:49.822 --> 02:09:52.243]  The TSA setting up checkpoints all over the country.
[02:09:52.283 --> 02:09:54.143]  We have another article out on it today.
[02:09:54.743 --> 02:09:58.044]  Setting up checkpoints, checking IDs with machine guns.
[02:09:58.605 --> 02:10:03.486]  MP5 Heckler & Koch 9mm in Florida.
[02:10:03.946 --> 02:10:06.387]  DHS officers arm a semi-automatic setup.
[02:10:06.907 --> 02:10:09.628]  Unannounced ID checkpoint in Leesburg, Florida.
[02:10:10.128 --> 02:10:12.088]  I mean, we are living in the Twilight Zone here.
[02:10:12.548 --> 02:10:14.509]  My report, again, is up at DrudgeReport.com.
[02:10:14.529 --> 02:10:15.269]  Easy place to find it.
[02:10:15.709 --> 02:10:17.930]  Some of the other news we have at InfoWars.
[02:10:18.770 --> 02:10:19.131]  I don't
[02:10:35.316 --> 02:10:39.979]  After he was on CNN and they cut the feed, then he went up and was on the stage with Ron Paul.
[02:10:40.319 --> 02:10:41.660]  They got the interview after that.
[02:10:42.300 --> 02:10:45.342]  And it may be one of the last times you hear from him because the U.S.
[02:10:45.422 --> 02:10:57.329]  Army said Wednesday that it is considering disciplining Reserve Corporal Jesse Thorson, the soldier who spoke out against the militaristic foreign policy at Ron Paul's post-Iowa caucuses rally.
[02:10:57.690 --> 02:11:04.514]  Well, I mean, as a citizen, he's allowed to talk about Ron Paul and supporting his view of military intervention.
[02:11:05.194 --> 02:11:11.580]  Certainly shared by the former head of the Joint Chiefs, Fox Fallon, Mullen, the outgoing guy, and of course now Dempsey.
[02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:13.321]  They finally hired somebody who will go along with it.
[02:11:13.341 --> 02:11:20.867]  By the way, Dempsey has all these weird quotes where he, I don't know why we're in Iraq, and I did say it, but we're there and I like it.
[02:11:21.047 --> 02:11:22.449]  You know, just really weird stuff.
[02:11:22.809 --> 02:11:24.430]  Let's go ahead and blast Iran!
[02:11:25.451 --> 02:11:26.472]  So that's going on there.
[02:11:26.512 --> 02:11:28.233]  We'll get his take on that as well.
[02:11:28.974 --> 02:11:31.356]  But Greg Hunter runs USAWatchdog.com.
[02:11:33.184 --> 02:11:42.610]  Great news site, and he's worked for ABC News, CNN, you name it, Nightly News, all of it, and brings all of that to his own research and reports there.
[02:11:43.471 --> 02:11:45.432]  Greg, great to have you back with us here today.
[02:11:46.413 --> 02:11:54.498]  What is your view and take on the big anomalies I know I've seen and others have witnessed, including people that were in the caucuses who called in from Iowa yesterday.
[02:11:55.399 --> 02:11:56.500]  What do you see happening there?
[02:11:57.168 --> 02:12:01.630]  Well, from the very beginning, I mean, right at the beginning, Ron Paul was up with 43% of the vote.
[02:12:02.091 --> 02:12:11.035]  Now that jives with most of the reporting of people going into the, you know, the caucus goers going in saying they're going to vote for Ron Paul.
[02:12:11.075 --> 02:12:15.878]  He was the clear frontrunner going in and by a wide margin.
[02:12:16.218 --> 02:12:36.983]  Now, you know, I don't know what went on in the background, but I think it's awful weird for a guy who was in, what, fifth or sixth place to shoot to the top with an eight-vote margin of second-place loss, which is Santorum, who Santorum was on Meet the Press, and he was talking about he would degrade their facilities, and I wanted David Gregory to say, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[02:12:37.343 --> 02:12:39.104]  Now, this isn't like bombing Libya.
[02:12:40.064 --> 02:12:40.404]  Senator.
[02:12:40.905 --> 02:12:46.929]  Iran has been basically put up as a line in the sand with China.
[02:12:47.409 --> 02:12:53.033]  And China has said that they will come to Iran's rescue, even if it causes World War III.
[02:12:53.073 --> 02:12:54.354]  This is pretty widely reported.
[02:12:54.734 --> 02:13:03.801]  Russia helps Iran with their nuclear facilities, and I don't think Russia is very keen on allowing the United States to bomb Iran's facilities.
[02:13:03.881 --> 02:13:08.264]  Now, they say, Iran says, it's for the peaceful production of energy.
[02:13:09.044 --> 02:13:11.405]  Listen, I'm American and I'm for the U.S.
[02:13:11.445 --> 02:13:29.368]  and I'm for our troops and all that, but just for an objective view, Iran has a lot of yellow cake and also uranium, and it would be a real normal path for Iran to take to say, hey, we need to develop our nuclear resources.
[02:13:29.388 --> 02:13:38.490]  They have a lot of uranium in Iran in the Middle East, and they would also preserve their fossil fuels at some point in the future.
[02:13:38.490 --> 02:13:38.650]  Sure.
[02:13:54.804 --> 02:13:55.064]  I don't know.
[02:14:18.466 --> 02:14:24.210]  And so, you know, I was saying from the very beginning, A, they started a central bank right from the get-go, just like that.
[02:14:24.571 --> 02:14:27.973]  What happened to the 144 tons of gold that Gaddafi had?
[02:14:28.253 --> 02:14:30.115]  Wouldn't that be great to settle contracts?
[02:14:30.175 --> 02:14:35.779]  But I guess they, when they run short, they just take your segregated accounts and don't deliver your gold and silver.
[02:14:35.819 --> 02:14:37.020]  Like, oh, IMF global!
[02:14:37.460 --> 02:14:39.782]  And so, but, you know, that was a very weird thing.
[02:14:39.802 --> 02:14:42.624]  We basically, I mean, you know, or you're for us or against us.
[02:14:42.884 --> 02:14:46.427]  Well, unless you're taking out Gaddafi, then you're, you know, then you're al-Qaeda and it's okay.
[02:14:46.827 --> 02:14:47.669]  So I don't understand that.
[02:14:47.709 --> 02:14:49.412]  We supported Al-Qaeda.
[02:14:49.633 --> 02:14:54.762]  This NDAA bill that just passed specifically said Al-Qaeda.
[02:14:55.123 --> 02:14:58.109]  Why are we supporting Al-Qaeda in Libya?
[02:14:59.030 --> 02:14:59.231]  Why?
[02:14:59.921 --> 02:15:01.022]  And back to the voting thing.
[02:15:01.222 --> 02:15:06.746]  Listen, I don't know what happened there, but all the reports... One thing, here's what the mainstream media does great.
[02:15:07.387 --> 02:15:09.328]  They report on the moment.
[02:15:09.769 --> 02:15:22.098]  Television, cable, television, mainstream media does a wonderful job if a bridge falls down, if a hurricane comes up for an election, and they did a wonderful job that night, and they were polling caucus-goers on the way in.
[02:15:22.498 --> 02:15:29.544]  And all their revolts, all their revolts, all their resources, and everybody that I watched said, wow, Ron Paul's gonna walk away in the
[02:15:29.804 --> 02:15:30.745]  Numbers first came up.
[02:15:31.185 --> 02:15:34.768]  Yeah, the exit polls look like 50% is what he should have gotten.
[02:15:35.068 --> 02:15:38.190]  The entrance polls showed that, but magically it didn't happen.
[02:15:38.450 --> 02:15:40.812]  I want to expand on that, but I want to play you a clip.
[02:15:41.272 --> 02:15:42.493]  We should talk about why.
[02:15:42.994 --> 02:15:44.295]  We should really talk about why.
[02:15:45.316 --> 02:15:47.177]  Absolutely, but I want to get your take on this.
[02:15:47.517 --> 02:15:52.658]  This was picked up by a couple of newspapers, but other than that it didn't get any attention.
[02:15:52.678 --> 02:15:54.118]  This is from Fox News.
[02:15:54.699 --> 02:16:06.582]  Karl Rove, their correspondent, talks about these key precincts with the missing votes, and we were being told this before we knew about the Karl Rove comments, and then they got in a room and had a gentleman's agreement
[02:16:07.512 --> 02:16:11.334]  and decided to boost Santorum by all these percentage points.
[02:16:11.874 --> 02:16:19.857]  I mean, this is a smoking gun where Karl Rove hides it in plain view the night of the election, hours before these numbers even came out.
[02:16:20.237 --> 02:16:24.819]  How is Karl Rove from Fox headquarters telling us this?
[02:16:25.419 --> 02:16:26.100]  Here is the clip.
[02:16:38.066 --> 02:16:40.334]  15 point margin for him.
[02:16:42.040 --> 02:16:42.281]  Point.
[02:16:45.137 --> 02:17:02.864]  For Santorum, Clinton County, we have the one outstanding precinct in the state, and that it will show an 18 vote victory in that precinct for Mitt Romney, which will give him a statewide victory of 14 votes over... And from out of nowhere, it's Rick Santorum!
[02:17:02.884 --> 02:17:06.885]  You're saying that they've basically come to an agreement as to what the votes are going to be in Clinton?
[02:17:06.945 --> 02:17:11.267]  The official, the person who's got the official piece of paper is missing.
[02:17:11.947 --> 02:17:16.730]  But the Romney and Santorum people who are monitoring it agree on what the number is.
[02:17:17.030 --> 02:17:20.271]  They apparently rounded up the representatives of the camps who have agreed.
[02:17:20.331 --> 02:17:21.032]  Yes, we were there.
[02:17:21.152 --> 02:17:24.633]  We know exactly what the vote total was and we both agree to what it was.
[02:17:27.566 --> 02:17:31.508]  Alright, and again, we're going to post that video clip up on the site.
[02:17:31.949 --> 02:17:33.429]  Our computer stuttered a few times.
[02:17:33.449 --> 02:17:34.370]  That's unedited though.
[02:17:34.770 --> 02:17:35.831]  That's from Fox News.
[02:17:35.911 --> 02:17:36.931]  What do you make of that?
[02:17:37.572 --> 02:17:46.857]  I say that's, he basically admitted that they decided between the two supposed frontrunners, who was going to win, why didn't they bring Ron Paul in?
[02:17:47.217 --> 02:17:48.378]  Why didn't they bring Newt Gingrich in?
[02:17:49.358 --> 02:17:50.239]  Why'd they all talk about it?
[02:17:50.259 --> 02:17:51.600]  That's my question.
[02:17:51.940 --> 02:17:54.883]  Yeah, that's a mind-boggling clip and it's not getting any attention.
[02:17:54.923 --> 02:17:57.805]  The Tribune newspaper reported on it.
[02:17:59.466 --> 02:18:05.091]  One long caucus, one delayed official add up the late results from Story County.
[02:18:05.551 --> 02:18:06.512]  So it is confirmed.
[02:18:06.532 --> 02:18:08.433]  Here's the examiner out of the Washington.
[02:18:08.914 --> 02:18:11.776]  Karl Rove, Romney has won Iowa by 14.
[02:18:11.816 --> 02:18:15.379]  It just mentions it as a footnote here.
[02:18:16.099 --> 02:18:21.281]  And this would have been enough of these votes to push Paul at least into second place.
[02:18:21.861 --> 02:18:28.083]  So here they are admitting that they moved up Santorum in a gentleman's agreement because they don't know where the guy is.
[02:18:28.343 --> 02:18:31.144]  You're supposed to call them in from each little caucus point.
[02:18:31.424 --> 02:18:34.345]  You're not supposed to have them all in a truck going somewhere to be counted.
[02:18:34.365 --> 02:18:36.465]  And look where that came from.
[02:18:36.505 --> 02:18:41.527]  That came from what Ames, which is the center, which is also the place of Iowa's
[02:18:41.527 --> 02:18:41.647]  Yes.
[02:18:41.787 --> 02:18:41.847]  Yes.
[02:18:56.915 --> 02:18:58.617]  And he says, I don't know, what does he need, a hail over his head?
[02:18:58.657 --> 02:19:00.399]  Well, you know, listen, I want to be objective.
[02:19:00.659 --> 02:19:11.069]  If somebody's getting a bad shake, if somebody's getting the short end of the stick, I want to be objective enough to say, hey, I'm not one of his supporters and I don't support any candidate or any party.
[02:19:11.490 --> 02:19:13.111]  I'm just trying to be objective.
[02:19:13.252 --> 02:19:14.453]  And he's getting a bad shake.
[02:19:15.013 --> 02:19:22.344]  I mean, the evidence shows he's getting a bad shake, and it at least shows they should do an investigation on what happened in Iowa.
[02:19:22.364 --> 02:19:23.746]  I mean, they got a guy in a truck.
[02:19:23.946 --> 02:19:24.987]  They don't have telephones.
[02:19:25.007 --> 02:19:26.049]  They don't have fax machines.
[02:19:26.349 --> 02:19:27.351]  They don't have computers.
[02:19:27.491 --> 02:19:28.752]  Well, they're supposed to call it in.
[02:19:28.773 --> 02:19:29.253]  They're supposed to...
[02:19:30.675 --> 02:19:31.175]  It's amazing.
[02:19:31.215 --> 02:19:31.495]  Stay there.
[02:19:31.515 --> 02:19:33.116]  We've got to come back and talk more about this.
[02:19:33.636 --> 02:19:35.436]  And we'll probably play that clip one more time.
[02:19:35.476 --> 02:19:37.517]  I think the guys gave it to us in a really high res.
[02:19:37.977 --> 02:19:42.478]  And then our computers are run on a gerbil on a wheel, so it was breaking up a bit.
[02:19:42.498 --> 02:19:46.340]  But we're going to try to come back and play that clip clean because it is so amazing.
[02:19:46.360 --> 02:19:48.260]  But here's the news articles breaking it down.
[02:19:48.920 --> 02:19:50.241]  Our guest is Greg Hunter.
[02:19:50.301 --> 02:19:51.281]  Your calls are coming up too.
[02:19:51.301 --> 02:19:55.202]  We're going to look more at Iran and some of this crazy police state news.
[02:19:55.762 --> 02:19:56.843]  Straight ahead with our guest.
[02:19:57.203 --> 02:19:57.703]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:01.704 --> 02:20:08.865]  HempUSA.org has a revolutionary wonder food for detoxing the body and rebuilding the immune system.
[02:20:09.065 --> 02:20:17.387]  Microplant powder can help unclog arteries and soften heart valves while removing heavy metals, virus, fungus, bacteria and parasites.
[02:20:17.587 --> 02:20:21.127]  Plus, it cleans and purifies the blood, lungs, stomach and colon.
[02:20:21.287 --> 02:20:24.268]  Keep your body clean with Microplant Powder.
[02:20:24.568 --> 02:20:27.789]  Visit us at HempUSA.org or call 908-691-2608 today!
[02:20:31.087 --> 02:20:32.148]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:20:32.328 --> 02:20:36.711]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:20:36.891 --> 02:20:42.595]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:20:42.695 --> 02:20:46.117]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:20:46.337 --> 02:20:48.939]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:49.059 --> 02:20:53.982]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:20:54.122 --> 02:20:54.343]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:54.363 --> 02:20:55.764]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:03.829 --> 02:21:07.873]  Folks, have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[02:21:08.313 --> 02:21:11.296]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[02:21:11.656 --> 02:21:15.720]  Because there's never been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead.
[02:21:16.040 --> 02:21:16.660]  Here's why.
[02:21:17.041 --> 02:21:22.846]  Solar power generators are now available from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[02:21:23.186 --> 02:21:27.670]  Their emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:21:28.030 --> 02:21:34.114]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[02:21:34.394 --> 02:21:37.997]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:21:38.257 --> 02:21:43.821]  Whether it's ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:21:44.201 --> 02:21:49.564]  When the power goes out this winter, you'll be ready with a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:21:49.825 --> 02:21:52.667]  Go to MySolarBackup.com for more information.
[02:21:52.827 --> 02:21:55.028]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:22:00.993 --> 02:22:02.254]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:22:02.294 --> 02:22:07.660]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:22:07.880 --> 02:22:12.524]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:22:12.905 --> 02:22:17.950]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:22:18.470 --> 02:22:23.173]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:22:23.694 --> 02:22:25.635]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:22:26.015 --> 02:22:30.618]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:22:30.818 --> 02:22:31.719]  And here's the best part.
[02:22:31.939 --> 02:22:34.701]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:22:35.001 --> 02:22:38.303]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:22:38.624 --> 02:22:41.465]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:22:41.806 --> 02:22:43.707]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:22:44.027 --> 02:22:44.968]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:22:48.590 --> 02:22:52.294]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:22:52.834 --> 02:22:57.339]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:22:57.659 --> 02:23:00.042]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:23:03.803 --> 02:23:08.526]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[02:23:08.966 --> 02:23:10.707]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[02:23:10.827 --> 02:23:14.029]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with Fake TV.
[02:23:14.370 --> 02:23:21.534]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television, so from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[02:23:21.834 --> 02:23:26.057]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[02:23:26.337 --> 02:23:32.081]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[02:23:32.401 --> 02:23:33.982]  Use it anytime you're away from home.
[02:23:34.202 --> 02:23:40.205]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[02:23:40.325 --> 02:23:49.530]  Each additional fake TV is only $29.95, so get one for you and one for a loved one for safety, security, and peace of mind for both of you.
[02:23:49.830 --> 02:23:55.293]  Call 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to faketv.com.
[02:23:55.553 --> 02:23:58.495]  Faketv.com, the burglar deterrent.
[02:24:06.524 --> 02:24:12.094]  By the way, our computer in there can't play files that are as big as our nightly news computers can.
[02:24:12.114 --> 02:24:13.296]  That's why that one was stuttering.
[02:24:14.890 --> 02:24:21.153]  And so coming up in the next segment, we're going to shrink that file down and be able to play that clean without a few stutters.
[02:24:21.193 --> 02:24:28.336]  And because it was for the Nightly News, we have a little joke in the clip where Carl Rove moves the horse of Ron Paul back.
[02:24:28.396 --> 02:24:32.338]  And we have a clip from the Kentucky Derby where they say, and out of nowhere...
[02:24:32.938 --> 02:24:36.299]  And it shows Sam Turam just appear there at the front of the pack.
[02:24:37.099 --> 02:24:38.800]  But we also have that clip raw.
[02:24:38.820 --> 02:24:41.921]  We're going to post it in an article at Infowars.com.
[02:24:41.981 --> 02:24:43.602]  But an amazing clip.
[02:24:43.722 --> 02:24:49.284]  Why would Karl Rove publicly talk about how there was a gentleman's agreement?
[02:24:49.744 --> 02:24:52.485]  And how did he know this was going on before anybody else did?
[02:24:52.885 --> 02:24:54.205]  And why would he talk about it?
[02:24:54.546 --> 02:24:56.926]  I mean, is it a case of hiding it in plain view?
[02:24:56.946 --> 02:25:01.088]  I mean, this is a guy well known for manipulating elections.
[02:25:04.347 --> 02:25:06.529]  I don't know.
[02:25:08.030 --> 02:25:09.952]  Maybe he was feeling his oats.
[02:25:10.472 --> 02:25:12.915]  Maybe he thought he was saying enough to where he was covered.
[02:25:13.275 --> 02:25:15.437]  I think he said enough to cast doubt.
[02:25:16.081 --> 02:25:17.062]  To cast real doubt.
[02:25:17.122 --> 02:25:19.044]  Now, did they manipulate the votes?
[02:25:19.184 --> 02:25:21.167]  We don't have actual evidence.
[02:25:21.207 --> 02:25:24.971]  We don't have an actual person who was in the room and said, yeah, they miscounted the votes.
[02:25:25.391 --> 02:25:38.065]  But boy, all the evidence around supporting that Ron Paul was winning, even on the election night from the caucus goers, the polls going inside, I heard one
[02:25:38.545 --> 02:25:43.012]  One of the reporters say, well, you know, they go in and they say they're going to vote for one person, but they can always change their mind.
[02:25:43.373 --> 02:25:48.160]  Well, then they've been, you know, thousands of people must have changed their mind because he was very early on.
[02:25:48.200 --> 02:25:52.146]  He was up by 43 percent and Romney wasn't even, I don't think he was in third place.
[02:25:53.570 --> 02:25:54.290]  Very early on.
[02:25:54.310 --> 02:26:00.012]  The very first time they started announcing who was in what place and who was in the lead.
[02:26:00.032 --> 02:26:03.173]  I don't know, but I know one thing.
[02:26:03.293 --> 02:26:12.776]  I wish somebody in the mainstream media would just sit down with Karl Rove or Ed Rollins or Mike Murphy and say, okay, tell us why you don't like Ron Paul.
[02:26:12.796 --> 02:26:17.678]  Because you have absolutely nothing good to say about him other than that he's got a lot of young people you'd like to get.
[02:26:18.078 --> 02:26:19.519]  Yeah, and that's it.
[02:26:19.579 --> 02:26:25.903]  Either they ignore him or when they are forced to cover him, they twist things and attack him, showing the power structure is scared.
[02:26:25.924 --> 02:26:27.284]  And that's the question you've been asking.
[02:26:27.425 --> 02:26:28.625]  Why are they so scared of him?
[02:26:28.966 --> 02:26:29.626]  I want to go to that.
[02:26:29.666 --> 02:26:32.608]  But here is the clip of Karl Rove.
[02:26:32.968 --> 02:26:35.030]  And again, the Tribune newspaper reported on this.
[02:26:35.070 --> 02:26:36.091]  The Washington Examiner.
[02:26:36.951 --> 02:26:39.173]  One long caucus, one delayed official.
[02:26:40.033 --> 02:26:45.898]  Add up to late results from Story County and they're at Ames with that big university.
[02:26:46.058 --> 02:26:46.378]  Oops.
[02:26:46.839 --> 02:26:49.281]  They had to put all those different precincts in a truck.
[02:26:49.821 --> 02:26:52.403]  It disappears and Karl Rove doesn't know where it is.
[02:26:52.864 --> 02:26:56.206]  But they had a gentleman's agreement and Santorum moved up.
[02:26:56.667 --> 02:26:58.528]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:26:58.568 --> 02:26:58.929]  Here it is.
[02:26:59.449 --> 02:27:02.411]  Romney is going to win the Iowa caucuses by 14 votes.
[02:27:02.751 --> 02:27:03.872]  How solid is your evidence?
[02:27:05.212 --> 02:27:06.853]  From a pretty good, reliable source.
[02:27:06.913 --> 02:27:14.958]  They made the correction in Story County, which moved it from an 18 point margin for Santorum to a 4 vote margin for Santorum.
[02:27:14.998 --> 02:27:28.285]  Clinton County, you have the one outstanding precinct in the state, and that it will show an 18 vote victory in that precinct for Mitt Romney, which will give him a statewide victory of 14 votes over
[02:27:29.366 --> 02:27:31.968]  From out of nowhere, it's Rick Santorum!
[02:27:31.988 --> 02:27:35.970]  You're saying that they basically have come to an agreement as to what the votes are going to be in Clinton?
[02:27:36.030 --> 02:27:40.392]  The official, the person who's got the official piece of paper is missing.
[02:27:41.052 --> 02:27:45.835]  But the Romney and Santorum people who are monitoring it agree on what the number is.
[02:27:46.135 --> 02:27:53.739]  They apparently have rounded up the representatives of the camps who have agreed, yes we were there, we know exactly what the vote total was, and we both agree to what it was.
[02:27:55.282 --> 02:27:59.284]  All right, and Greg Hunter of USA Watchdog, investigative journalist, joins us.
[02:27:59.324 --> 02:28:00.125]  This is a short segment.
[02:28:00.145 --> 02:28:00.805]  We're going to break.
[02:28:00.825 --> 02:28:03.266]  We're going to come back and cover a bunch of other issues with you.
[02:28:03.286 --> 02:28:06.068]  But, I mean, continue with your breakdown of this.
[02:28:06.448 --> 02:28:07.069]  Well, two things.
[02:28:07.509 --> 02:28:12.151]  Number one, he said, well, he said first Romney and Santorum.
[02:28:12.412 --> 02:28:15.833]  Then they rounded up the representatives of the camp, like as if they talked to other people.
[02:28:15.873 --> 02:28:16.654]  They didn't, I don't think.
[02:28:16.934 --> 02:28:17.875]  That's not what it sounds like to me.
[02:28:17.895 --> 02:28:18.375]  That's number one.
[02:28:18.415 --> 02:28:27.961]  Number two, as an investigative reporter, I always had to make a decision to protect a source or not protect a source, because you always want to name your sources.
[02:28:28.461 --> 02:28:39.968]  And if somebody is talking about, hey, wow, there's this new report that says depleted uranium will cause cancer and I'll lose my job at the Defense Department and they'll prosecute me for, you know, being a traitor, then I have to protect that source.
[02:28:40.288 --> 02:28:40.368]  OK?
[02:28:41.371 --> 02:28:43.272]  And you want to make sure you protect the source.
[02:28:43.292 --> 02:28:49.275]  But if it's somebody in a public election, you want to know about the good old boy meeting, put the source out there.
[02:28:49.635 --> 02:28:50.315]  What's the source?
[02:28:50.335 --> 02:28:59.560]  You know, and listen, Chris Wallace is the son of Mike Wallace, who's done all kinds of investigative reporting, knows better than that.
[02:28:59.900 --> 02:29:01.300]  And you say from a pretty good source.
[02:29:01.341 --> 02:29:02.221]  Well, what source is that?
[02:29:02.765 --> 02:29:05.326]  Why didn't he say, what source is that?
[02:29:05.626 --> 02:29:06.287]  Who's the source?
[02:29:06.447 --> 02:29:08.788]  There's no reason you would protect that source.
[02:29:09.048 --> 02:29:10.049]  Who's the source?
[02:29:10.269 --> 02:29:11.229]  Oh, just a pretty good source.
[02:29:12.230 --> 02:29:12.490]  Really?
[02:29:12.650 --> 02:29:12.870]  Who?
[02:29:13.870 --> 02:29:22.695]  No, they were just going to let him have the inside baseball there and hide it in plain view so that we don't know to who to go talk to that source as well.
[02:29:22.995 --> 02:29:25.356]  They're just hoarding the sources because they don't want us to know.
[02:29:26.297 --> 02:29:27.978]  Who knows who the source is?
[02:29:28.778 --> 02:29:33.360]  Well, that's a sign they don't want you to know who the source is.
[02:29:33.400 --> 02:29:34.420]  Yeah, there's more hanky-panky.
[02:29:34.720 --> 02:29:42.663]  Stay there, let's finish up on the election looking forward, and then more on Iran and phone calls with our guests straight ahead.
[02:29:43.464 --> 02:29:48.906]  And of course, then you've got the Republican strategist the day before saying the insiders have got it fixed.
[02:29:50.560 --> 02:29:53.561]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.462 --> 02:29:57.243]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.244 --> 02:30:05.046]  Did you ever think you'd be where you are, a decade into the 21st century?
[02:30:05.366 --> 02:30:09.148]  Record foreclosure rates for homes, if not yours, your neighbor's.
[02:30:09.528 --> 02:30:18.972]  Thankful for the unemployment checks since you were laid off, and placing your child's name on the angel tree in hopes of a Christmas gift, along with thousands of other Americans.
[02:30:19.472 --> 02:30:22.674]  Did you ever think your future would feel this out of control?
[02:30:22.694 --> 02:30:27.636]  The fact is, in all this craziness, there's only one thing you can control.
[02:30:27.917 --> 02:30:29.177]  Your greatest dependency.
[02:30:29.457 --> 02:30:30.498]  Your food supply.
[02:30:30.878 --> 02:30:34.720]  Make 2012 the year you take control by getting prepared.

[02:31:05.071 --> 02:31:05.992]  Tyranny is here.
[02:31:06.352 --> 02:31:09.873]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:31:10.214 --> 02:31:12.475]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:31:12.675 --> 02:31:17.958]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:31:18.378 --> 02:31:24.661]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:31:25.041 --> 02:31:30.584]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:31:31.004 --> 02:31:34.726]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:31:35.186 --> 02:31:39.169]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:31:39.470 --> 02:31:45.394]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:31:45.414 --> 02:31:48.376]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:31:48.977 --> 02:31:50.378]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:31:50.958 --> 02:31:51.459]  It's here.

[02:32:01.192 --> 02:32:06.614]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:32:07.835 --> 02:32:12.617]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:32:12.997 --> 02:32:19.780]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:32:21.701 --> 02:32:24.022]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:32:25.783 --> 02:32:28.084]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:32:30.203 --> 02:32:34.085]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:32:34.785 --> 02:32:37.927]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[02:32:38.627 --> 02:32:39.448]  Others don't.
[02:32:39.868 --> 02:32:41.749]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:32:42.009 --> 02:32:43.510]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[02:32:43.790 --> 02:32:46.351]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:32:46.671 --> 02:32:52.935]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.

[02:32:56.016 --> 02:32:58.037]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[02:32:58.377 --> 02:32:59.238]  Others don't.
[02:33:16.178 --> 02:33:20.141]  We're going back to our guest here in a moment and then into some other important issues and news.
[02:33:20.161 --> 02:33:22.162]  I want to get his take on your calls here today.
[02:33:22.202 --> 02:33:25.084]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:33:25.284 --> 02:33:32.349]  I know we've had callers holding since before he joined us, but he can certainly talk about pretty much any issue out there.
[02:33:32.389 --> 02:33:37.753]  He's a very well-researched gentleman, but if you guys bring up kind of side topics, I won't even really have anything to say.
[02:33:38.453 --> 02:33:44.217]  Because I mainly focused on the economy, what's happening in Iran, the unfolding police state and the rest of it.
[02:33:45.278 --> 02:33:52.042]  Every few months, I've always done this in my 17 years on air, I do satirical skits.
[02:33:53.703 --> 02:33:57.886]  Global Love Cop, a guy dressed up in a Storm Trooper outfit telling you how great the police state is.
[02:33:59.367 --> 02:34:02.829]  Or I did a thing with John Corzine, you know, saying I'm not going to tell you where the money went.
[02:34:03.310 --> 02:34:06.152]  You know, with a banker top hat dressed up like the Monopoly man.
[02:34:07.225 --> 02:34:08.045]  And I've done a new one.
[02:34:08.806 --> 02:34:11.507]  It's up at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:34:11.867 --> 02:34:13.408]  We did it on the nightly news last night.
[02:34:14.769 --> 02:34:16.510]  Cobra Commander for President.
[02:34:17.410 --> 02:34:23.273]  And I'm illustrating in the piece that our government's doing everything that cartoon villains would do.
[02:34:24.053 --> 02:34:28.395]  Secret arrest, torture, preemptive war.
[02:34:28.996 --> 02:34:31.697]  And so Cobra Commander announces he's going to run for president.
[02:34:32.697 --> 02:34:44.923]  And I got the idea seeing the trailer for the new Cobra movie coming out, which is really just a military recruitment film, where Cobra, this international terrorist group, takes over the White House.
[02:34:45.483 --> 02:34:47.564]  And so I'm basically speaking from the White House.
[02:34:48.564 --> 02:34:51.926]  I see commenters there saying, Alex, where did you get the giant Cobra thrown?
[02:34:52.386 --> 02:34:53.667]  Folks, that's blue screen.
[02:34:54.767 --> 02:34:55.748]  Somebody mailed me.
[02:34:56.812 --> 02:34:58.253]  Two Cobra Commander outfits.
[02:34:58.973 --> 02:35:01.255]  Because I've done a joke about Cobra Commander a few months ago.
[02:35:01.275 --> 02:35:02.536]  So I thought, well, I've got these.
[02:35:03.176 --> 02:35:03.717]  I see this.
[02:35:03.777 --> 02:35:04.757]  I'll do a skit with this.
[02:35:04.817 --> 02:35:08.900]  And some people, it's got 852 likes to 48 dislikes.
[02:35:10.301 --> 02:35:13.163]  And some people are in there, you know, since it went up last night.
[02:35:13.963 --> 02:35:16.065]  And they're saying, Alex, this is a joke.
[02:35:16.105 --> 02:35:17.066]  You shouldn't joke around.
[02:35:17.486 --> 02:35:20.268]  Really, Rush Limbaugh didn't joke around on his TV show?
[02:35:21.877 --> 02:35:22.657]  And do satire?
[02:35:23.597 --> 02:35:29.159]  Really, Anderson Cooper didn't get a half-naked woman with him on his news show to get ratings?
[02:35:29.479 --> 02:35:30.579]  That's not what I'm doing.
[02:35:30.919 --> 02:35:35.540]  When something's satire once every two, three, four months, it's clearly that.
[02:35:35.980 --> 02:35:38.041]  And of course, that's just a talking point to attack us.
[02:35:40.342 --> 02:35:43.842]  Most people, I guess 20 to 1, yeah, 20 to 1 or so, like it.
[02:35:46.627 --> 02:35:50.028]  It's funny, it's goofy, and it's gallows humor.
[02:35:50.068 --> 02:35:53.630]  We can't just sit up here and be serious about this all day or we go crazy.
[02:35:54.570 --> 02:36:02.894]  Now we do have a serious video on the NDAA that's got close to a half million views that I shot from home right after Obama signed it.
[02:36:04.598 --> 02:36:19.248]  There on New Year's Eve, so no one would notice, and I have a new one that we also just aired today and posted, titled, The NDAA is a hoax.
[02:36:19.769 --> 02:36:21.270]  You cannot legalize tyranny.
[02:36:21.730 --> 02:36:23.131]  Marbury vs. Madison.
[02:36:23.171 --> 02:36:25.332]  Anything repugnant to the Constitution is null and void.
[02:36:25.372 --> 02:36:25.773]  Any law.
[02:36:26.813 --> 02:36:29.355]  Could they have laws against saying black people are slaves?
[02:36:29.995 --> 02:36:30.136]  No!
[02:36:31.070 --> 02:36:34.415]  But, and if they tried to pass those laws, we would stand against them.
[02:36:34.816 --> 02:36:35.697]  They're illegitimate.
[02:36:36.038 --> 02:36:42.327]  In fact, let's shift gears into the NDAA, because I know you've written about this over at your USA Watchdog news site.
[02:36:43.652 --> 02:36:50.477]  When you look at this, when you see this kind of stuff happening, why do you think, same question, why are they cheating Ron Paul, clearly?
[02:36:50.857 --> 02:36:56.581]  In the coverage and how much time he gets in debates, all sorts of evidence of fraud in Iowa.
[02:36:57.161 --> 02:36:58.682]  Why are they doing that to Ron Paul?
[02:36:58.702 --> 02:37:03.906]  But also, why are they saying they want to censor the internet now and validating our position and proving we were right?
[02:37:04.266 --> 02:37:10.590]  Why are they getting so naked about their tyranny, so brazen, so hubris-filled?
[02:37:11.070 --> 02:37:13.232]  Or is it an attempt to flee forward
[02:37:13.853 --> 02:37:15.055]  And is it desperation?
[02:37:15.195 --> 02:37:21.708]  Why are they saying, we'll secretly arrest citizens, we'll have worldwide combat, including in America, we'll end posse comitatus?
[02:37:21.989 --> 02:37:23.371]  Why is that happening, Greg Hunter?
[02:37:24.022 --> 02:37:26.443]  Well, I'll answer your question with a question.
[02:37:26.483 --> 02:37:27.524]  What are they getting ready for?
[02:37:27.904 --> 02:37:29.925]  What are they doing at checkpoints in Florida?
[02:37:29.945 --> 02:37:30.825]  I think they're practicing.
[02:37:31.105 --> 02:37:32.426]  What are they doing at the FEMA camps?
[02:37:32.466 --> 02:37:39.709]  I think they're going to need camps because I think we're headed for an economic collapse.
[02:37:39.789 --> 02:37:41.010]  And I'm not the only one that said that.
[02:37:41.090 --> 02:37:43.711]  There's a guy by the name of Ray Dalio who runs Bridgewater Association.
[02:37:44.491 --> 02:37:44.711]  I think?
[02:38:04.584 --> 02:38:07.545]  I also said in 2008, in March, all the banks were in trouble.
[02:38:07.565 --> 02:38:11.527]  I've been saying that for months before, that all of the banks were in trouble.
[02:38:11.547 --> 02:38:14.948]  This is in March of 2008, and of course we didn't have the collapse until what, October?
[02:38:15.408 --> 02:38:18.529]  And so, but he looked at me at CNN like I had two heads, like, what do you mean?
[02:38:18.950 --> 02:38:22.071]  Well, as it turns out, you know, they did collapse.
[02:38:22.091 --> 02:38:24.271]  Well, my question is, what are they getting ready for?
[02:38:24.311 --> 02:38:26.652]  And I think they're getting ready for some sort of collapse.
[02:38:26.732 --> 02:38:28.153]  And if they bomb Iran,
[02:38:28.923 --> 02:38:36.106]  Like Rick Santorum wants to do, like many of the neocons want to do, it's not going to be as simple as people think.
[02:38:36.166 --> 02:38:38.407]  Can our Navy defeat the Iranian Navy?
[02:38:38.727 --> 02:38:39.727]  Without question.
[02:38:40.427 --> 02:38:44.989]  Our Navy is probably the best in the world by now, but that doesn't mean that our Navy won't take some big hits.
[02:38:45.049 --> 02:38:49.851]  I mean, the Chinese, I'm sure, have sold Iran these missiles that are shipped to
[02:38:50.331 --> 02:38:56.895]  A carrier destroying missiles that fly about three feet off the water and can take out a carrier at a few hundred miles.
[02:38:56.915 --> 02:39:00.737]  You know, the Persian Gulf is only a few hundred miles wide at its widest point, maybe.
[02:39:01.277 --> 02:39:02.438]  Maybe three or four hundred miles long.
[02:39:02.458 --> 02:39:03.359]  It's not that big, really.
[02:39:03.379 --> 02:39:03.939]  It's not an ocean.
[02:39:03.979 --> 02:39:05.360]  It's not like hiding out in the Indian Ocean.
[02:39:06.140 --> 02:39:19.672]  And so, Ken, the other thing is that if we have this warfare with Iran, they're not going to pull up the USS Iranian, excuse me, the Iranian battleship and have a broadside.
[02:39:19.692 --> 02:39:21.273]  I mean, we're not going to be doing that.
[02:39:21.969 --> 02:39:26.595]  And they don't have aircraft carriers, and they don't have battleships, and ageist missile cruisers.
[02:39:27.135 --> 02:39:32.682]  What they do have are guys in speedboats with RPGs and torpedoes and asymmetrical warfare.
[02:39:32.942 --> 02:39:41.953]  And how much asymmetrical warfare does it take for people who own ships full of oil to say, I'm not going to take my ship through this 30 miles straight?
[02:39:42.731 --> 02:39:50.233]  So even if they don't shut it down completely, and of course, you know, former Secretary Cohen said that they cannot shut down the strait.
[02:39:50.253 --> 02:39:53.374]  Well, maybe they can, but they can sure slow down some oil flow.
[02:39:53.414 --> 02:39:54.334]  And what is that?
[02:39:54.834 --> 02:39:57.855]  Anywhere from about 30 to 40 percent of the world's oil a year.
[02:39:58.595 --> 02:40:01.176]  And they've been working on this for a while.
[02:40:02.056 --> 02:40:02.856]  Hold on just a minute.
[02:40:02.896 --> 02:40:03.677]  I'm just going to get rid of that.
[02:40:03.937 --> 02:40:06.117]  They've been working on this for a while.
[02:40:06.137 --> 02:40:08.818]  You know, they've been practicing.
[02:40:09.793 --> 02:40:18.377]  Yeah, this isn't Iraq who was under 15 years of sanction and had been carpet bombed before that, and an unpopular dictator.
[02:40:18.737 --> 02:40:24.760]  The Iranians, up against U.S., British, and Israeli funding, as you know, in the tens of billions, over $50 billion total, the U.S.
[02:40:24.780 --> 02:40:27.262]  gave them $35 billion, and even U.S.
[02:40:27.302 --> 02:40:34.245]  CIA advisors and satellite help, over a million, what, and a half Iranians died, 300,000 Iraqis.
[02:40:34.625 --> 02:40:38.047]  I mean, the Iranians do have their you-know-what together.
[02:40:39.244 --> 02:40:40.745]  Well, listen, they're going to fight.
[02:40:40.785 --> 02:40:42.425]  They've been planning this for a long time.
[02:40:42.465 --> 02:40:53.770]  And what I want to say to people is, hey, listen, if it's going to be a, you know, something that is in the interest of the world, in the interest of the United States of America, and we're going to go to war, it's not going to be just the Iranians.
[02:40:54.490 --> 02:41:02.553]  I said this earlier, that the Chinese have publicly stated in no uncertain terms that they will side with Iran, even if it means World War III.
[02:41:02.573 --> 02:41:04.174]  They said that on Chinese television.
[02:41:04.194 --> 02:41:04.774]  It's on my site.
[02:41:04.814 --> 02:41:07.575]  Well, they said it about, exactly, they said it about Pakistan, too.
[02:41:07.635 --> 02:41:08.456]  I mean, this is really
[02:41:09.096 --> 02:41:15.641]  Making the war lines draw, and we're all run by hedge fund managers like Corzine, who makes 40 to 1 bets with other people's money.
[02:41:15.661 --> 02:41:21.586]  I mean, these guys are in control, but I think they are irrationally exuberant.
[02:41:21.706 --> 02:41:23.488]  I think they are clinically insane.
[02:41:24.068 --> 02:41:31.493]  Well, listen, I think it's the, you know, supposedly of the seven deadly sins, the sin of pride is the worst and the most destructive.
[02:41:31.574 --> 02:41:31.834]  Why?
[02:41:31.874 --> 02:41:38.899]  Because when you're prideful and when you think that you're invincible, boy, you're setting yourself up to be knocked off that fine white charger.
[02:41:39.299 --> 02:41:41.661]  And you're setting yourself up to get a big pie in the face.
[02:41:42.121 --> 02:41:44.143]  And our economy is fragile at best.
[02:41:44.243 --> 02:41:48.346]  I mean, if nothing else happened from here on out, maybe, maybe we could grow our way out of it.
[02:41:48.726 --> 02:41:49.447]  I don't think we can.
[02:41:49.467 --> 02:41:52.189]  And that's why all the military top generals in the U.S.
[02:41:52.229 --> 02:41:56.652]  and Israel and England are saying don't do it, but they're going ahead with it.
[02:41:56.752 --> 02:42:07.320]  Why are all the generals, except for one guy they found, Dempsey now, and the former head of the Israeli military, the former Mossad head, who they had to get rid of because they're not for this?
[02:42:07.460 --> 02:42:11.303]  Why, from your research, I know you've covered this a lot, why are they telling them don't do it?
[02:42:11.563 --> 02:42:13.445]  Why are they calling it a catastrophe?
[02:42:14.085 --> 02:42:15.286]  They know it's going to be a mess.
[02:42:15.346 --> 02:42:24.355]  I mean, Alex, how long can Americans stand 8 or 10 or 12 dollar oil in fuel lines like we had in the 70s?
[02:42:24.575 --> 02:42:26.317]  You know, in the 70s, we had a really strong country.
[02:42:26.577 --> 02:42:30.821]  We didn't have, what, a half a trillion dollar deficit maybe in the 70s?
[02:42:30.981 --> 02:42:32.843]  300 billion dollars in the 70s?
[02:42:32.863 --> 02:42:33.584]  We could take a hit.
[02:42:33.864 --> 02:42:35.045]  In the 90s, we could take a hit.
[02:42:36.076 --> 02:42:37.417]  We're not set up to take a hit.
[02:42:37.437 --> 02:42:52.131]  We had this massive bailout where the Federal Reserve, which incidentally didn't get hardly any coverage, the Government Accountability Office nailed $16.2 trillion that got pumped out to bail out domestic and foreign banks, domestic and foreign companies.
[02:42:52.671 --> 02:42:54.153]  Who knows how much got paid back.
[02:42:54.213 --> 02:42:56.495]  They say most of it's been paid back, defined most.
[02:42:56.995 --> 02:43:00.236]  And we can't audit the Fed, so who knows what happened.
[02:43:00.296 --> 02:43:02.517]  Who do they pick as a winner and who do they pick as a loser?
[02:43:02.918 --> 02:43:04.858]  Evidently, they picked MF Global as a loser.
[02:43:05.138 --> 02:43:10.721]  But anyway, the long and short of it is they don't, the generals know that this is a giant mess.
[02:43:11.001 --> 02:43:15.883]  This is not going to be like, you know, Force A and Force B meeting each other on the battlefield.
[02:43:16.023 --> 02:43:16.543]  Oh, no, no.
[02:43:16.783 --> 02:43:18.744]  This is going to be asymmetrical warfare.
[02:43:19.004 --> 02:43:23.526]  This is going to be, you know, Hezbollah is going to be turned loose in the north, you know, which is
[02:43:23.726 --> 02:43:30.790]  I think part of the reason why they want to knock out Syria, Hamas is going to be turned loose in the south, Israel is going to be under, you know, major attack.
[02:43:31.971 --> 02:43:47.000]  The other thing is, and I was thinking about this, is that at this point, if Israel does, and I think they do, it's been widely reported they have two to three hundred nuclear weapons, well, then we can't let Israel fall into the hands of Hamas or Hezbollah, now can we?
[02:43:48.061 --> 02:43:49.942]  They can't get a hold, they can't be overrun.
[02:43:50.851 --> 02:43:56.858]  If they are overrun, then who gets control of the two or three hundred nuclear weapons that Israel reportedly possesses?
[02:43:57.591 --> 02:43:58.612]  Well, we're kind of stuck there.
[02:43:58.872 --> 02:44:08.041]  No, the elite are causing a giant crisis, exactly as you said, to distract from the economic implosion, which is actually a mega bank takeover.
[02:44:08.381 --> 02:44:10.042]  I think they're going to have the implosion anyway.
[02:44:10.143 --> 02:44:14.006]  I think they know mathematically at this point we might as well print money.
[02:44:14.386 --> 02:44:15.568]  We're going to have the implosion.
[02:44:15.788 --> 02:44:18.210]  Let's buy time as long as we can to prepare.
[02:44:18.891 --> 02:44:19.511]  That's what I think.
[02:44:19.551 --> 02:44:20.832]  And other people say the same thing.
[02:44:20.872 --> 02:44:22.534]  I mean, we never fixed, you know, this whole
[02:44:22.574 --> 02:44:25.556]  No, no, the military's all being told get ready for civil unrest.
[02:44:25.616 --> 02:44:40.468]  How do you add to the equation 1.5 million instant checks, average 2.1 guns bought, that's over 3 million guns, an all-time record, sold in the month of December, and that's just through registered gun shops, not just the private seller market, a reseller market.
[02:44:41.188 --> 02:44:49.199]  And they did a survey I saw where the number one reason they're buying guns is fear of unrest, collapse, and not trusting the government.
[02:44:49.460 --> 02:44:57.791]  I mean, what message is that to these banksters that run the government that the public just bought three million guns in one month because they don't trust you?
[02:44:58.956 --> 02:45:03.298]  Well, I think the military is not going to all line up and get on board with this.
[02:45:03.598 --> 02:45:09.420]  I just don't see everybody in the military saying, yeah, this is OK, we'd like to have a military government.
[02:45:09.460 --> 02:45:14.443]  I mean, listen, you know, our military has grown up under the flag of the United States and the U.S.
[02:45:14.463 --> 02:45:15.203]  Constitution.
[02:45:15.543 --> 02:45:17.944]  I think the overwhelming majority of the people in
[02:45:17.944 --> 02:45:18.404]  I don't think so.
[02:45:40.226 --> 02:45:43.308]  Our military service people and their families.
[02:45:43.848 --> 02:45:53.254]  Everybody else is out drinking their lattes and having a good time and getting bailouts and the only people that are coming home with their limbs torn off and people coming home in boxes at Dover are the people in the military.
[02:45:53.894 --> 02:46:03.880]  And listen, you know, one thing I gotta say is that if this is such a national security, such national security importance, then I think everybody should sacrifice.
[02:46:04.180 --> 02:46:05.041]  We should have a tax.
[02:46:05.865 --> 02:46:07.006]  We should have the draft.
[02:46:07.146 --> 02:46:09.387]  I think Charlie Rangel was right to say, hey, we should have a draft.
[02:46:09.587 --> 02:46:10.988]  We shouldn't be paying contractors $150,000.
[02:46:11.388 --> 02:46:20.794]  Incidentally, we took all of our troops out of Iraq, supposedly, but yet I think the number is something in the neighborhood of 70,000 contractors left behind.
[02:46:20.814 --> 02:46:23.255]  Are we really out of Iraq?
[02:46:23.455 --> 02:46:24.716]  We just up and left?
[02:46:24.856 --> 02:46:25.817]  I don't think so.
[02:46:26.616 --> 02:46:28.837]  Let me ask you this question, and then I want to go to some calls.
[02:46:30.498 --> 02:46:33.479]  The ruling class acts like they're not worried about anything anymore.
[02:46:33.499 --> 02:46:36.641]  I mean, as you know, 20-something years ago, they wouldn't let the troops use and put a uranium.
[02:46:37.261 --> 02:46:39.162]  Now they just tell them, don't worry about it, it's good for you.
[02:46:40.123 --> 02:46:42.184]  They tell the TSA workers... I did a big thing on that.
[02:46:42.344 --> 02:46:43.204]  I did a big thing on that.
[02:46:43.224 --> 02:46:44.305]  Well, that's why I brought it up to you.
[02:46:44.325 --> 02:46:45.345]  Yeah, I saw it.
[02:46:45.365 --> 02:46:46.386]  But I mean, here they are.
[02:46:48.160 --> 02:46:52.705]  Now telling TSA workers, I've had TSA people tell me, there's no radiation, it's not bad for me.
[02:46:53.045 --> 02:46:58.210]  And then I see all these top scientists in the news saying it's bad, the body scanners.
[02:46:58.691 --> 02:47:04.737]  So I'm just saying the level of deception, even for the minions that are in the system, what do you think's going on?
[02:47:04.777 --> 02:47:05.157]  Go ahead.
[02:47:05.517 --> 02:47:07.679]  I think they're getting, listen, they're practicing.
[02:47:08.400 --> 02:47:09.681]  This is like a big ship.
[02:47:09.701 --> 02:47:13.083]  You don't take and turn a big ship like a motorboat.
[02:47:13.123 --> 02:47:15.624]  And I think the changes coming to America are going to be vast.
[02:47:15.664 --> 02:47:18.686]  And of course, the status quo wants to hang on to power.
[02:47:18.926 --> 02:47:20.106]  And they don't really want to fix anything.
[02:47:20.126 --> 02:47:22.408]  And this is why, let's come right back around to Ron Paul.
[02:47:22.868 --> 02:47:23.108]  Listen.
[02:47:23.792 --> 02:47:24.852]  They sold liar loans.
[02:47:25.112 --> 02:47:31.634]  Okay, people like Rush Limbaugh, I listened to him on the air the other day, and I think he's an intensely, wonderfully intelligent man.
[02:47:31.915 --> 02:47:43.858]  And for him to come up with what he's saying is absolutely, you know, outrageous and repugnant for a man of his intelligence to say, well, the government made all these bankers, you know, make these loans.
[02:47:44.098 --> 02:47:49.140]  You know, the best frauds were a nugget of truth surrounded by a big load of, you know, crap.
[02:47:49.740 --> 02:47:56.386]  And yes, maybe the government did want bankers to have poor people to have more access to capital, but they didn't tell them to have liar loans.
[02:47:56.747 --> 02:48:01.631]  They didn't tell them to take those liar loans, which were fraudulent, and package them up into securities.
[02:48:02.072 --> 02:48:08.357]  Oh, and they didn't have the paperwork, so they lost them according to the robo-signing, where they were manufacturing the promissory note.
[02:48:08.618 --> 02:48:10.459]  You think you pay for your house in 30 years.
[02:48:10.519 --> 02:48:11.040]  You do not.
[02:48:11.440 --> 02:48:12.160]  You pay for your house.
[02:48:12.180 --> 02:48:19.083]  Well, sure, it was the mega banks on record that lobbied government to make those changes and create that big auction market.
[02:48:19.163 --> 02:48:20.924]  Yeah, but they couldn't lobby fraud.
[02:48:20.944 --> 02:48:24.565]  When you package securities up, you've got to have the promissory notes in the securities.
[02:48:24.585 --> 02:48:25.245]  No, I understand.
[02:48:25.265 --> 02:48:28.967]  The buck stops with the banks and the people certifying those loans.
[02:48:29.347 --> 02:48:34.328]  We have massive, giant fraud that happened to Americans.
[02:48:34.588 --> 02:48:38.389]  It was so big they changed the accounting rules in 2009 and they're still changed.
[02:48:38.849 --> 02:48:46.731]  The Financial Accounting Standards Board, FASB, said you can value assets, real estate, mortgage-backed securities, at whatever value you think they'll be in the future.
[02:48:47.011 --> 02:48:49.051]  Now the IRS does not do that.
[02:48:49.611 --> 02:48:51.692]  Oh, you want to pay off this loan with your house?
[02:48:51.912 --> 02:48:54.593]  Oh, you want me to value it in the year 2040?
[02:48:54.753 --> 02:48:55.013]  No!
[02:48:55.433 --> 02:48:56.313]  What's the value today?
[02:48:56.809 --> 02:48:58.352]  It's called mark-to-market accounting.
[02:48:58.852 --> 02:49:03.460]  And if they did mark-to-market accounting, see, I suspect all the big banks are insolvent.
[02:49:03.880 --> 02:49:05.503]  And here, prove me wrong.
[02:49:05.743 --> 02:49:07.386]  Go back to mark-to-market accounting.
[02:49:08.341 --> 02:49:24.488]  You value the stuff on your books, and I think if it's such a big problem that they can't print enough money to hand out to the banks, and incidentally, they handed out nearly $200 billion in forgiveness and money through Fannie and Freddie just to one bank, Bank of America, last year.
[02:49:25.268 --> 02:49:25.648]  Amazing.
[02:49:25.688 --> 02:49:26.908]  Let's sham in a call right now.
[02:49:26.949 --> 02:49:28.089]  It's just total insanity.
[02:49:28.469 --> 02:49:29.690]  Hyperinflation on the way.
[02:49:29.750 --> 02:49:31.890]  George in Pennsylvania, you're on with our guests.
[02:49:31.910 --> 02:49:32.911]  You got any comments or questions?
[02:49:33.868 --> 02:49:35.409]  Three quick ones and I'll listen off air.
[02:49:35.950 --> 02:49:46.019]  One of them was that I had talked with you before about having people that were voting in New Hampshire register with someplace that they were voting for Ron Paul so we can avoid this issue.
[02:49:46.379 --> 02:49:53.586]  At least have some people that are willing to say, yes, I will stand up in court and say that I voted for him just so we can take some of these fraudsters to court.
[02:49:55.507 --> 02:50:01.830]  Real quick on 14th Amendment says if the loans are made in the government's name, the government is not responsible for them.
[02:50:01.870 --> 02:50:03.930]  I think that this has all been fraudulent.
[02:50:03.990 --> 02:50:05.611]  I think the 14th Amendment protects us.
[02:50:05.651 --> 02:50:07.052]  I think we can throw all this stuff out.
[02:50:07.452 --> 02:50:07.912]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:50:07.952 --> 02:50:10.313]  We've been signed on to these derivatives that we don't owe.
[02:50:11.173 --> 02:50:11.613]  It's correct.
[02:50:11.633 --> 02:50:12.314]  You're correct, sir.
[02:50:12.754 --> 02:50:14.094]  So the answer is yes, you're correct.
[02:50:15.015 --> 02:50:15.635]  They're fraudulent.
[02:50:18.353 --> 02:50:19.573]  I'll tell you what, that's a good point.
[02:50:19.593 --> 02:50:21.854]  We're going to break, Greg, but start answering it now.
[02:50:21.874 --> 02:50:23.855]  What are ideas to try to stop election fraud from your research?
[02:50:40.240 --> 02:50:43.823]  Well, why are we having election fraud?
[02:50:43.923 --> 02:50:47.746]  The reason why is we have two corporate candidates, which is Romney and Obama.
[02:50:48.006 --> 02:50:48.246]  Okay?
[02:50:48.567 --> 02:50:48.907]  Period.
[02:50:48.967 --> 02:50:52.590]  Even starch Obama supporters say, hey, he's Wall Street's man, right?
[02:50:52.850 --> 02:50:55.892]  Even Michael Moore has been saying negative things about Obama.
[02:50:55.912 --> 02:50:56.113]  Stay there.
[02:50:56.153 --> 02:50:57.153]  Let's finish on the other side.
[02:50:57.213 --> 02:50:58.014]  To finish that point.
[02:50:58.074 --> 02:50:58.895]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:01.331 --> 02:51:03.314]  Introducing a diabetes breakthrough.
[02:51:03.594 --> 02:51:06.778]  An easy, natural, organic way to bring relief to diabetics.

[02:51:13.187 --> 02:51:14.970]  What can MDS Forte do for you?
[02:51:15.250 --> 02:51:18.154]  MDS Forte reduces glucose levels safely and effectively.
[02:51:18.314 --> 02:51:18.714]  I think so.
[02:51:38.579 --> 02:51:40.200]  Waiting for the side effects disclaimers?
[02:51:40.420 --> 02:51:42.602]  With MDS Forte, there are none.

[02:51:50.507 --> 02:51:51.928]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:52:02.535 --> 02:52:12.958]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[02:52:13.178 --> 02:52:20.100]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without your help.

[02:52:35.145 --> 02:52:40.787]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[02:52:41.307 --> 02:52:50.791]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[02:52:51.191 --> 02:52:52.351]  The war is here.
[02:52:52.671 --> 02:52:54.072]  It's an info war.
[02:52:54.572 --> 02:52:57.273]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[02:53:00.931 --> 02:53:03.413]  As we age, we lose both strength and muscle mass.
[02:53:03.914 --> 02:53:09.618]  Undamaged whey protein from grass-fed cows is nature's most powerful food to gain back lost muscle.
[02:53:09.959 --> 02:53:15.263]  Virtually all whey protein powders or drinks have been damaged during processing or are high in sugar.
[02:53:15.403 --> 02:53:20.988]  This damaged whey causes a significant loss in the ability of the body to build new muscle proteins.
[02:53:21.508 --> 02:53:26.592]  The high sugar content will stop all the benefits of your growth hormone from causing muscle repair.
[02:53:27.273 --> 02:53:34.297]  By giving your body easily absorbed, undamaged whey, free of added sugar, you may be able to gain back lost muscle and strength.
[02:53:34.617 --> 02:53:38.659]  One World Whey is truly undamaged whey protein powder free of added sugar.
[02:53:39.160 --> 02:53:44.543]  Both young and elderly are reporting increases in muscle strength and size without any additional exercise.
[02:53:45.143 --> 02:53:46.924]  Go to OneWorldWay.com.
[02:53:46.984 --> 02:53:53.427]  That's OneWorldWhey.com to read or hear some impressive testimonies to this effect.
[02:53:53.967 --> 02:53:54.788]  Or call 888-988-3325.
[02:53:54.828 --> 02:53:55.028]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:53:55.048 --> 02:53:56.268]  A couple notes here.
[02:53:56.308 --> 02:53:59.210]  Don't forget I'll be back tonight with the nightly news 7 o'clock.
[02:54:15.069 --> 02:54:25.014]  We have the author of Dr. Mary's Monkeys that breaks down the government's development and the documents of cancer viruses as a weapon, fast-acting cancer.
[02:54:26.055 --> 02:54:27.476]  He'll be joining us.
[02:54:27.516 --> 02:54:30.257]  We'll cover a lot of the news we didn't get to in some of the breaking news.
[02:54:32.138 --> 02:54:38.002]  Also, it's out of print, and I told Charlotte Isabry, okay, well, don't put out the phone book size.
[02:54:38.022 --> 02:54:40.103]  We'll put out another abridged and updated.
[02:54:41.496 --> 02:54:45.360]  Deliberate dumbing down how the globalists have dumbed down education by design.
[02:54:45.760 --> 02:54:46.160]  It's out.
[02:54:46.220 --> 02:54:46.841]  It's available.
[02:54:46.881 --> 02:54:48.042]  She's joining us tomorrow.
[02:54:48.403 --> 02:54:52.947]  The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America, revised and abridged, available at InfoWars.com.
[02:54:54.068 --> 02:55:03.357]  Still a very thick book full of documents and a noble lie, Oklahoma City proving that that was a false flag attack, conclusively available at InfoWars.com as well.
[02:55:03.417 --> 02:55:04.037]  This stuff is
[02:55:05.254 --> 02:55:10.838]  A stake to a vampire's heart, both these pieces of information warfare material.
[02:55:11.879 --> 02:55:16.862]  Going back to our guest, Greg Hunter of USAWatchdog.com.
[02:55:18.163 --> 02:55:21.466]  Greg, what are some of your ideas to counter election fraud?
[02:55:21.986 --> 02:55:28.250]  Well, first of all, you're up against, people like you and I, are up against a big, big mountain.
[02:55:28.290 --> 02:55:30.872]  But the mountain is shrinking, and our mountain is rising.
[02:55:31.012 --> 02:55:32.033]  That's the good news.
[02:55:32.073 --> 02:55:42.060]  The bad news is, President Obama goes on 60 Minutes at the beginning of December in front of Steve Kroft and says, well, the banks did unethical things, but they didn't do anything illegal.
[02:55:42.460 --> 02:55:50.246]  Of course, Steve Kroft, who makes five or six million a year in the mainstream media, didn't ask, hey, well, exactly what unethical things did they do?
[02:55:50.906 --> 02:56:15.329]  And listen, according to, you know, to William Black, who's a former, you know, regulator, banking regulator, and a professor of economics and law, says they packaged liar loans, that they sold liar loans, they packaged them in securities, they got a tax exemption, they rated these securities many times without any paperwork, and then they created the paperwork in foreclosure fraud,
[02:56:15.709 --> 02:56:17.890]  And there's fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud.
[02:56:18.190 --> 02:56:19.390]  And nothing's been done wrong.
[02:56:19.410 --> 02:56:21.531]  This is a huge, massive problem.
[02:56:21.771 --> 02:56:28.073]  In the wake of the savings and loan crisis, they basically successfully convicted 1,000 financial elites.
[02:56:28.113 --> 02:56:29.374]  They gave out 10,000 indictments.
[02:56:29.514 --> 02:56:33.495]  Do you know how many people have been indicted and convicted in the wake of this crisis?
[02:56:34.436 --> 02:56:34.856]  Zero!
[02:56:35.556 --> 02:56:36.097]  None.
[02:56:36.237 --> 02:56:37.839]  No, it's a green light to take money.
[02:56:37.880 --> 02:56:47.653]  Look at MF Global now, and we've got cases of Bank of America and others taking houses, not only where they don't own it or have the deed, but the house is paid for in cash for a decade.
[02:56:48.013 --> 02:56:51.578]  I mean, and this is getting to the point of just mega criminality.
[02:56:52.560 --> 02:56:55.462]  Yes, and where's Eric Holder?
[02:56:55.683 --> 02:57:03.190]  And you know what, I don't want to be against the Democrats, because there is not a dime's worth of difference between the Democrats and the Republicans.
[02:57:03.751 --> 02:57:11.979]  Obama's a corporate candidate, and some of his far-left supporters are like, hey, even Rachel Maddow came out against Obama for citing the NDAA.
[02:57:12.199 --> 02:57:13.961]  Listen, she understands what's going on.
[02:57:14.581 --> 02:57:17.945]  Uh, whether you like her politics or not, she gets what's going on.
[02:57:18.025 --> 02:57:23.091]  Anybody that does journalism, you know, wants a fair shake and be able to speak their mind.
[02:57:23.131 --> 02:57:26.094]  And this NDAA is a slippery slope.
[02:57:26.114 --> 02:57:29.178]  Yes, I know they say it's Al-Qaeda, but the president has an
[02:57:29.298 --> 02:57:30.079]  Thank you very much.
[02:57:46.241 --> 02:57:48.083]  We have not a free and independent media.
[02:57:48.103 --> 02:57:48.543]  Well said.
[02:57:48.583 --> 02:57:48.983]  Well said.
[02:57:49.023 --> 02:57:49.764]  We're out of time.
[02:57:50.104 --> 02:57:51.025]  Greg Hunter, amazing.
[02:57:51.045 --> 02:57:54.228]  You've got a lot of energy and got a lot of great reports there at your site.
[02:57:54.268 --> 02:57:55.328]  You really cut through the clutter.
[02:57:55.649 --> 02:57:56.910]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:57:56.930 --> 02:57:58.191]  I look forward to talking to you in the future.
[02:57:58.631 --> 02:57:59.492]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:57:59.692 --> 02:57:59.972]  You bet.
[02:58:00.032 --> 02:58:14.224]  I got to a lot of calls today, folks, and I would go into overdrive and take more, but I've got to kind of keep my strength to be able to do the nightly news tonight because I did crack my sternum in a weightlifting accident, as you know, last weekend, and now it's healing and getting excruciatingly painful to even breathe or talk.
[02:58:15.289 --> 02:58:17.389]  Uh, but, uh, I will be back tomorrow.
[02:58:17.990 --> 02:58:20.390]  Uh, because I'm sure not gonna lay in bed going through this pain.
[02:58:20.670 --> 02:58:23.891]  And I'm not gonna have surgery, and I'm not gonna wrap my chest or any of that.
[02:58:23.911 --> 02:58:30.332]  Um, but, uh, pray for its speedy recovery, though, because it is getting, it is getting worse and worse.
[02:58:31.152 --> 02:58:33.153]  Um, but, uh, that's it for this transmission.
[02:58:33.213 --> 02:58:39.374]  Get our video, uh, about the NDAA being a hoax at InfoWars.com and get it out to everybody.
[02:58:39.414 --> 02:58:40.114]  Wake folks up.
[02:58:40.134 --> 02:58:44.475]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.124 --> 02:58:48.470]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.297 --> 02:58:53.402]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you
