[00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:14.635]  Judge Joseph Dredd has come to the screens once again, this time the adaptation simply titled Dredd.
[00:00:15.156 --> 00:00:17.478]  I'm Jakari Jackson for the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:21.703]  Let's analyze this trailer to find the fact behind the fiction of this new film.
[00:00:22.064 --> 00:00:22.824]  Spoiler alert!
[00:00:23.145 --> 00:00:25.327]  You know how often we get a judge up in peace trees?
[00:00:26.388 --> 00:00:27.510]  Well, you got one now.
[00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:40.641]  The Judge Dredd storyline takes place in 2070, after war has devastated the majority of the United States, leaving only a few large sections of land known as Megacities inhabitable.
[00:00:41.181 --> 00:00:44.044]  Megacities are full of cramped skyscrapers that house the city's population.
[00:00:49.901 --> 00:01:03.262]  Agenda 21 highlights include the destruction of the family unit in the name of sustainable development, with people being forced to live in tight, compact cities in high-rise stack-em-and-pack-em apartments no bigger than this 16 by 16 foot space.
[00:01:04.023 --> 00:01:04.945]  See any similarities?
[00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:17.730]  There we saw a drone patrolling the city skies.
[00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.291]  Now this is probably the least futuristic aspect of the entire trailer.
[00:01:21.671 --> 00:01:24.052]  Mainly because there are drones patrolling the U.S.
[00:01:24.072 --> 00:01:24.872]  skies right now.
[00:01:25.772 --> 00:01:28.233]  It wasn't long ago that it was said that drones in the U.S.
[00:01:28.253 --> 00:01:29.093]  would be unarmed.
[00:01:29.513 --> 00:01:34.395]  But even relatively small law enforcement agencies have been able to secure them for their own purposes.
[00:01:34.775 --> 00:01:36.996]  This one's even designed to carry weapons.
[00:01:37.056 --> 00:01:39.256]  You have a stun baton where you can actually engage somebody.
[00:01:39.576 --> 00:01:41.477]  Let's take a look now at a judge's uniform.
[00:01:42.237 --> 00:01:42.618]  Black.
[00:01:43.178 --> 00:01:43.779]  Heavy armor.
[00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:45.801]  With a helmet that doubles as a mask.
[00:01:46.261 --> 00:01:52.106]  Back in 1977 when Judge Dredd first debuted, it was considered science fiction for police to dress like this.
[00:01:52.647 --> 00:01:55.750]  Now, in cities such as Colorado Springs, it's standard issue.
[00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:03.173]  Also, take note of a judge's lawgiver, a biometric firearm that can only be fired by its designated user.
[00:02:03.773 --> 00:02:08.116]  A modification that the New Jersey Institute of Technology has been developing for years.
[00:02:08.536 --> 00:02:14.100]  Now it's important to point out that even though judges are charged with executing quote law, they are not police.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.643]  Judges came into power at the end of the 21st century when they overthrew the U.S.
[00:02:18.683 --> 00:02:19.383]  Constitution.
[00:02:19.823 --> 00:02:22.305]  But I'm sure nothing like that could ever happen in our time.
[00:02:22.975 --> 00:02:28.881]  I've told my administration we're going to look every single day to figure out what we can do without Congress.
[00:02:29.622 --> 00:02:31.965]  What can we do without it?
[00:02:32.445 --> 00:02:37.871]  Do I think that our actions in any way violate the War Powers Resolution?
[00:02:38.592 --> 00:02:39.233]  The answer is no.
[00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:42.837]  So I don't even have to get to the constitutional question.
[00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:51.012]  Now, I'm not saying that Karl Urban, the writer, the directors, or anybody else involved in this film is purposely pushing a police state agenda.
[00:02:51.332 --> 00:02:58.675]  I'm just saying that this film is a great example of what a police state can be, and as you've seen from this short video, we are not very far from it.
[00:02:59.175 --> 00:03:01.396]  Now, here's a good spoiler for all you fanboys out there.
[00:03:01.816 --> 00:03:07.959]  At the end of the film, Dredd kills the movie's villain, Mama, by throwing her from the top of a 200-story building.
[00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:11.240]  The sentence is death.
[00:03:14.926 --> 00:03:19.319]  Dread has already been released in the UK and is set for release here in the States at the end of September.
[00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:22.006]  I'm Jakari Jackson for the InfoWars Nightly News.
